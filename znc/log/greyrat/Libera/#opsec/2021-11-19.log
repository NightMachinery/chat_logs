[00:13:11] <jan6> 22:05 <iz> so it's like number operator number operator
[00:14:03] <jan6> well, idk if it's normal for rpn, but at least dc allows you to put the operators either in the number sequence, or at the end, because of the stack
[00:14:38] <jan6> so you could do "1 1 + 3 *" or you could do "1 1 3 + *" and they'd be the same (plus a "print" statement)
[00:15:39] <jan6> also japansese is "reverse order"? huh?
[00:28:21] <CalimeroTeknik> opposite construction of sentence compared to Indo-European yes
[00:29:02] <CalimeroTeknik> the order in which the ideas/words come in the sentence is opposite to English
[00:31:24] <iz> yeah, instead of "i told you", it's more like "i subjectmarker you objectmarker told"

[01:22:36] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[01:22:45] <kveroneau> Hello Joanna!
[01:24:22] <Joanna> What’s new ?
[01:24:28] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[01:27:13] <kveroneau> Not too much, and yourself?
[01:29:00] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@46.36.119.66) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:30:05] <Joanna> I started fumbling with different part of code recently
[01:32:19] <kveroneau> I haven't coded for about a week now or so.  I am thinking of getting back into the swing of things soon, maybe today after work.
[01:33:27] <Joanna> Don’t go too long you may forget how :) it’s happened to me before
[01:35:55] <kveroneau> I've went at least a few years away from FreePascal as I was focusing on other stuff.  It surprisingly comes back fast for me.  But keeping it going does allow me to progress faster on writing better code and learning new concepts.
[01:37:12] <Joanna> I work on one part of code and forget what I did on different part of code...
[01:37:55] <kveroneau> Is this a big project with a lot of modules?
[01:40:44] <Joanna> Yes you could say that. I prefer many smaller files
[01:40:46] <jan6> lol
[01:41:04] <jan6> forgetting what some part does, and forgetting coding itself, are very different things ;P
[01:41:42] <kveroneau> Very true.
[01:41:44] <jan6> coding and programming are not that easy to forget, although would still get rusty without use, yes
[01:42:01] <jan6> "like riding a bicycle!"
[01:42:03] <jan6> heh
[01:42:27] <jan6> but people forgetting what some other part of a codebase does, happens all the time, to many people
[01:42:30] <Joanna> I’ve forgotten coding after several months of not practicing. I even forgot the keyboard shortcuts for ide. It was horrible..
[01:42:54] <jan6> and "when I wrote it only god and I knew what it did, now only god knows" is pretty famous saying too
[01:43:31] <Joanna> I feel like code was written by someone else when I come back to it.
[01:44:26] <kveroneau> I tend to separate my code into modules which matches it's name.  For a server I am writing, one module is aptly called `tcpserver` which is solely the TCP listening socket code side of things, a rather small file tbh.  Then I have another much larger module called `protocol` which is well, the protocol for the server.  Every project is different, but I find placing the code in a module where it makes the most sense makes it much easier to come back 
[01:44:28] <kveroneau> to after awhile.
[01:45:29] <jan6> modular approach is the best
[01:45:59] <jan6> and also helps a lot when it's reusable
[01:46:01] <kveroneau> I also try to avoid super generic module names like `utils` or `common`, and rather use a proper name to describe what it's used for.
[01:46:10] <Joanna> I want to make code that can be used by many projects
[01:46:41] <jan6> you might not be able to reuse the EXACT code, but you most likely can make a module library for yourself which requires only minor modifications to get started with any new project
[01:46:52] <kveroneau> I wrote a Lazarus Package I egotically named `klib` which has a lot of reusable code I share between multiple projects I have.
[01:47:13] <jan6> klib, like the kernel libc?
[01:47:19] <jan6> lol
[01:47:34] <kveroneau> k as in the first letter of my first name, like how Linux is named after Linus
[01:47:39] <jan6> noice
[01:48:06] <kveroneau> I'm absolutely horrible at naming anything.
[01:48:15] <jan6> I'm not
[01:48:24] <jan6> I'm not good at doing anything of substance tho
[01:48:25] <Joanna> I use a lot of inheritance so things can be overridden if they aren’t perfect.
[01:48:51] <jan6> like I can make a pretty nice website design...with nothing to put onto it, I can make a program...which I'll never use... etc
[01:48:52] <jan6> lol
[01:48:52] <kveroneau> I did that a lot with my Python code, as Python classes were almost made to be sub-classed.
[01:49:06] <jan6> python has "decorators"
[01:49:10] <jan6> those are REAL useful
[01:49:18] <kveroneau> Oh they are super useful.
[01:49:31] <kveroneau> I absolutely loved that feature in Python.
[01:49:33] <Joanna> After many years I finally started putting the year something was last edited at the end of the name..
[01:50:53] <kveroneau> That's not a bad idea.
[01:51:29] <jan6> so far the only reusable bits of code I've made I can recall are: "read one byte" in posix shell script, a sort of debugging line printing module (with selectable verbosity levels) in Haxe, and...that's about it...I've also wrangled with decorators for my crude IRC bot, which helps me to not need to repeat all the function arguments for every single command, but meh
[01:51:30] <Joanna> I like to reuse old files instead of making new ones
[01:51:53] * jan6 makes ideas more than "things"
[01:51:54] <jan6> lol
[01:52:03] <jan6> I have unlimited ideas for everyone else
[01:52:05] <jan6> and none for myself
[01:52:24] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.36.119.66)
[01:52:54] <Joanna> I have ideas that only I am interested in programming...
[01:53:26] <jan6> lol
[01:53:34] <kveroneau> I tend to build stuff that doesn't currently exist in the market that I want to use.  When I created my home automation system, which mainly controls my Philips Hue bulbs around my home in an eco-friendly manner, nothing existed on the market(and I still don't think does).
[01:53:54] <jan6> I really like acme.com, for the simple reason they're not afraid to put out publically code that might not be useful to nearly anyone else
[01:55:23] <jan6> such as that "overlay" program I linked earlier... or "watch for new mail" (which is usually already installed, or easily installable from repos)... or "text to html converter"... etc
[01:55:40] <kveroneau> Least to say, I wasn't pleased with how manual it was to control my lights using Philip's phone app all the time.  It means to switch on or off lights easily, I first needed to unlock my phone, open their app, and select the theme or lights I wanted.  So annoying. :(
[01:56:09] <jan6> a LOT of programs, a lot of which are trivial, and sometimes outright not needed, like "revl, reverses lines in a file" which is the exact same thing "tac" does
[01:56:52] <jan6> in android 11+ there's "controls" in power menu, fyi
[01:57:11] <kveroneau> Now there is.  There wasn't in 2015.
[01:57:17] <jan6> yeeeaaah
[01:57:45] <kveroneau> I still like my current system better than what's on offer on current SmartPhones tbh
[01:57:51] <jan6> nowdays you can do a ton of stuff, you can write bootable USBs from your phone, you can program an arduino from your phone, etc
[01:58:18] <kveroneau> A SmartHome should be well *smart* and should be able to do stuff on it's own without any human interaction.
[01:58:54] <jan6> and a cool trick I've not tried is, using headphone jack to allow your phone to act as an IR remote (like to control your TV or stuff), or as an ocilloscope (if you trust the voltage to be safe enough levels)
[01:59:46] <Joanna> kveroneau: I avoid using lights at night when possible:)
[02:00:13] <Joanna> I don’t own a tv either:)
[02:00:22] <jan6> "hey google, turn off my lights after 11"
[02:00:25] <jan6> >;P
[02:01:07] <jan6> smart homes are smart if you hook them up to someone else's datacenter ;P (or your own, there's at least one foss home automation system too)
[02:01:24] <Joanna> I don’t like bright lights at night I try to use faint lights when I can
[02:01:30] <jan6> duh
[02:01:57] <jan6> that's what a lot of dark mode people do, too, only use dark mode at evening/night
[02:02:43] <Joanna> I have lamp with light the same size as an old Xmas tree light bulb that gives a nice orangish glow
[02:02:55] <jan6> cool
[02:03:19] <jan6> one could do a lot of custom cool stuff, too, if one had the willingness to spend the time and effort
[02:03:56] <Joanna> Unfortunately my home is not well designed and parts of it are far from exterior windows
[02:04:58] <jan6> you cooould always just set up a switch at the other end and throw stuff at it ;P
[02:05:55] <jan6> or set up a project with light sensors near the windows, which dim or switch the lights 'n stuff according to outside light (overrideable for rainy days etc)
[02:07:51] <Joanna> Even in middle of day my kitchen is rather dark
[02:08:15] <jan6> exactly, a good use for your light-sensor-synced-lights project!
[02:08:54] <jan6> you could also set up door sensors, to detect when you leave a room, to turn off lights where you left, to save power
[02:09:13] <jan6> (worst case when it desyncs, just open-close the door twice or so, lol)
[02:09:14] <Joanna> Eek no thanks :)
[02:09:48] <jan6> if it's all wired, and connected to an airgapped system, like an arduino, then what could go wrong?
[02:09:49] <jan6> lol
[02:10:10] <jan6> (actually it's simple enough that it COULD be even discreet logic, I bet)
[02:10:19] <Joanna> I don’t like that “smart” stuff
[02:10:33] <jan6> I don't like that smart stuff when it's someone else's smartness
[02:11:04] <jan6> I like my own smartness, but I'm lazy ;P

[02:27:51] <Joanna> It looked like they were doing something with adjacent elevator
[02:28:17] <iz> he was working late after the building was closed for the weekend, at like 11pm friday night
[02:31:05] <Joanna> That’s strange just shutting down elevator in middle of nowhere
[02:31:25] <Joanna> I’m surprised he could get door open
[02:32:13] <Joanna> It’s easy to get trapped in stairwells of buildings like that also
[02:34:40] <Joanna> Most people are super lazy and always take elevator no matter what,
[02:35:55] <Joanna> I only use elevator if I have something too heavy to carry.
[02:39:14] <iz> so it was an express elevator, iirc
[02:39:26] <iz> like where it just does floors 30-40 or whatever
[02:39:47] <iz> and it got stuck in the spot where it's just elevator shaft and no doors
[02:39:51] <kveroneau> I live high up, so an elevator is a bit of a must for me.
[02:40:41] <Joanna> I wonder why it got stuck. The lights stayed on
[02:44:44] <Joanna> kveroneau: how high ?
[02:51:46] <Joanna> I don’t much care for high rises

[15:35:02] <Joanna> Hi
[15:35:12] <Joanna> _inky:
[15:35:58] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: I think that only happens in movies :)
[15:36:01] <_inky> (:
[15:36:42] <_inky> once i got stuck in the elevator. it went down as much as possible.
[15:36:57] <_inky> and i tried to open the dors, but there was a wall.
[15:37:06] <_inky> because i went out of the house for a minute
[15:37:07] <Joanna> What happened ?
[15:37:22] <_inky> i didn't take with me internet access point and the phone.
[15:37:39] <_inky> (i have no sim card in the phone, but in access point)
[15:37:46] <_inky> so i was there for several hours
[15:38:09] <Joanna> I’m not sure what the reception would be
[15:38:10] <_inky> then some people noticed me, called someone, and he already knew how to restart the elevator.
[15:38:32] <_inky> so he restarted the elevator, and apparently that was a 'known bug'.
[15:38:38] <Joanna> How did they notice you ?
[15:38:39] <_inky> sometimes it freaks out and goes down.
[15:38:47] <_inky> i was shouting loudly for hours. (:
[15:39:00] <_inky> and nobody was going in or out of the building.
[15:39:07] <_inky> because it was a residential building.
[15:39:15] <_inky> and eventually someone came.
[15:39:39] <Joanna> I always have fear of elevator falling probably because of some movie I saw
[15:39:59] <_inky> yeah, sometimes they fall. but usually they are well maintained.
[15:40:06] <Joanna> Don’t you have stairs ?
[15:40:17] <_inky> for example here, we have lots of soviet elevators, that work very hard, and aren't maintained well.
[15:40:27] <_inky> they weren't designed to work that long.
[15:40:52] <Joanna> Modern buildings hide the stairs and even if you find them the air is stagnant and the doors lock
[15:40:53] <_inky> if you know electronics a bit you also notice how the engine works - it is not working and suddenly starts working.
[15:41:03] <_inky> in modern elevators it starts and stops by slowing down.
[15:41:13] <_inky> because they use the feature of increasing the frequency.
[15:41:17] <_inky> or decreasing.
[15:41:34] <_inky> Joanna: yes, same with airplanes.
[15:41:49] <_inky> so old airplaines had many things done mechanically.
[15:41:57] <_inky> for example, you pull the... 
[15:42:04] <_inky> let me check how is it called.
[15:42:13] <Joanna> Some buildings have stairs on the outside depending on country
[15:42:49] <_inky> well, i was thinking it'd be different from just 'steering wheel'
[15:43:19] <_inky> yes, in case of fire they can be used. they have a mainanence problem in NY by themselves.
[15:43:28] <_inky> most of them aren't maintained, and sometimes they fall.
[15:43:52] <_inky> so, the steering wheel, you pull it, then the elerones on the wing go up, then the plane goes up.
[15:43:58] <Joanna> They are supposed to go to first floor and open I thought
[15:44:01] <_inky> you push it, elerons go down, the plane goes down.
[15:44:11] <_inky> it was mechanically back then.
[15:44:21] <_inky> not that it was always working mechanically. it sometimes didn't.
[15:44:33] <_inky> but now it is in electronics, controlled by computer.
[15:44:51] <Joanna> Mechanical things are much more trustworthy
[15:44:52] <_inky> so we had an airplane crash like that. i know it because i know personally many people from aviation.
[15:45:01] <_inky> i don't know, sincerely.
[15:45:20] <_inky> lets say mechanical shutter of the camera isn't working as presice as electronic shutter.
[15:45:43] <_inky> but if it fails we can repair it? possibly? if we understand which kind of wheel or other broken detail we need to print. or cut.
[15:45:51] <_inky> back to the planes.
[15:46:07] <_inky> so there was a plane from Yerevan to Sochi in i guess 2003 or 2005, something like that.
[15:46:36] <_inky> i know someone who was participating in the aftermath research.
[15:47:01] <_inky> so they reached Sochi, but the weather was bad. and they didn't know what to do - go back, go to other town, or try to land.
[15:47:23] <_inky> if they go to other town or back, then the owner of the air company won't be happy, and may punish them somehow.
[15:47:35] <_inky> so they were making circles above the city, trying to decide what to do.
[15:47:45] <_inky> when they were doing second circle, something happened.
[15:48:21] <_inky> something like a push from down.
[15:48:50] <_inky> may be explosion. noone knows, but probably it was a lightning in a form of a ball.
[15:49:11] <Joanna> Planes are dangerous
[15:49:14] <_inky> i know other pilot who experienced such thing inside the plane.
[15:49:24] <_inky> and it exploded.
[15:49:34] <_inky> so after that the plane goes down to the sea.
[15:49:46] <_inky> and we know from recordings that pilots were trying to bring it up
[15:49:50] <_inky> by pulling the joysticks.
[15:49:59] <_inky> they don't have wheels on airbus planes
[15:50:06] <_inky> they have joysticks.
[15:50:11] <_inky> on boeing it is still wheels.
[15:50:24] <Joanna> Did anyone survive?
[15:50:33] <_inky> so they pull it in a way the plane should go up this amount, but it only goes up very small amount.
[15:50:41] <_inky> they do it three times before hitting the water and dying.
[15:50:45] <_inky> noone.
[15:51:22] <_inky> so
[15:51:24] <Joanna> I remember in 2019 when autopilot was crashing planes.
[15:51:37] <_inky> for some reason, it didn't work as expected.
[15:52:05] <_inky> probably that was a software bug, after something unexpected happened (the explosion outside?) and then
[15:52:27] <_inky> the same movement of joystick didn't bring up the elerones to the same position as expected.
[15:52:30] <_inky> but
[15:52:39] <_inky> of course the commission decided to blame the dead pilots.
[15:52:58] <Joanna> Oh yea they love to do that
[15:53:09] <_inky> they said: if they did a decision to land or to go to nearby city or to go back, it would never happen.
[15:53:20] <_inky> so because the pilots were not decisieve enough, this happened.
[15:53:49] <Joanna> Maybe they lost hydraulics?
[15:54:02] <_inky> well to some extent they are saying the truth. and i know stories with my grandfather, who also was a pilot, and he was sayng 'i made a decision to not land and go somewhere', i know such stories. so this is about decision.
[15:54:10] <_inky> but also there probably was a software bug.
[15:54:18] <_inky> and i am sure airbus tried to investigate and find the bug.
[15:54:36] <_inky> and if you watched 'aircrash investigations', i watched some on youtube,
[15:54:41] <_inky> there was one story, one exact story
[15:54:45] <Joanna> There are a lot of software bugs
[15:54:51] <_inky> when the crash happened because of joysticks and not steering wheels.
[15:55:00] <_inky> because those steering wheels connected to each other mechanically.
[15:55:14] <_inky> one pilot cannot  do left 100% and other right 100%
[15:55:27] <_inky> >There are a lot of software bugs
[15:55:33] <_inky> even when you write in Ada.
[15:55:54] <_inky> so that exact crash, it was a flight from Brazil to don't remember where, but it happened near the shore of Africa.
[15:56:04] <Joanna> Some things really shouldn’t be entrusted to software
[15:56:21] <_inky> pilots panicked and used joysticks in a way it is physically not possible to do with wheels.
[15:56:24] <_inky> and it crashed.
[15:56:39] <_inky> >Some things really shouldn’t be entrusted to software
[15:56:48] <_inky> yeah, we know how 'they' write it. how we write it. (:
[15:57:09] <_inky> but of course i am sure Airbus and Boeing have pretty good code.
[15:57:21] <_inky> sometimes it fails, of course. because complex systems are hard to handle.
[15:57:26] <_inky> do you know about Arian-5 crash?
[15:57:33] <_inky> it was a EU space mission.
[15:57:35] <Joanna> Boeing outsourced their software to a cheaper country probably india
[15:58:03] <Joanna> Nope
[15:58:27] <_inky> it happened because of software bug again: cast from 64bit number to 16bit number.
[15:58:32] <_inky> they lost 500 million euros.
[15:58:50] <_inky> but they did know that part of code that does cast is unsafe.
[15:59:06] <_inky> it was marked as unsafe. they did think it is ok to use it again, because the same code was tested, practically with Arian-4.
[15:59:15] <_inky> but Arian-5 mass was different.
[15:59:19] <_inky> that's why the cast failed this time.
[15:59:24] <Joanna> There really is no good reason to have flights over land when high speed rail is better.
[15:59:42] <_inky> but if they stuck with proper safe Ada subset the problem would not happen.
[15:59:52] <_inky> speed?
[16:00:27] <_inky> ah, yeah, probably when traveling inside EU i would prefer railroad.
[16:00:34] <_inky> or even my car.
[16:00:39] <Joanna> Speed over the ocean is much faster than boats but high speed trains can go fast enough.
[16:00:42] <_inky> but how do you reach USA from EU?
[16:00:53] <_inky> yes.
[16:01:01] <Joanna> Boat or plane
[16:01:10] <_inky> so the other problem i remember was when in USSR they were using FORTRAN for calculations.
[16:01:25] <_inky> and there was an unnoticed problem with '.' and ',' symbols.
[16:01:28] <Joanna> Get rid of all flights over land ..
[16:01:34] <_inky> one means real number in fortran.
[16:01:40] <_inky> and the other means something else.
[16:02:04] <_inky> but russian programmers/scientists did not notice that, because they use comma in real numbers in schools and everywhere.
[16:02:05] <_inky> not dots.
[16:02:10] <_inky> so it crashed as well.
[16:02:16] <Joanna> It’s impossible for most code to be bug free if it’s complicated
[16:02:33] <_inky> well, Tony Hoar said something like that: it's not possible unless
[16:02:45] <_inky> you have many layers of abstraction, and you keep every layer simple enough
[16:02:56] <_inky> to be sure that it's bug free.
[16:03:00] <_inky> also safe languages help a lot.
[16:03:16] <_inky> i don't want to be in a plane by knowing its software is written in C.
[16:03:31] <_inky> but Ada is better. Though it's monstrous, because it's too big, and it's a problem according to Wirth.
[16:03:42] <Joanna> Do you think people are pushing unsafe languages on purpose?
[16:03:54] <_inky> no, i think this:
[16:04:02] <_inky> we are in the early stage of IT.
[16:04:10] <Joanna> Which are safest languages in descending order?
[16:04:21] <_inky> we were in the early stage of big cities in the middle of last century.
[16:04:42] <_inky> so they did not know what to do. they used some solutions in city designs, that we today know didn't work well.
[16:04:52] <_inky> and it is hard to fix.
[16:05:08] <_inky> in software it is even worse, because it is not stone, and we wrote a lot of code, that we cannot rewrite now.
[16:05:17] <_inky> so alchemy came before rational chemistry.
[16:05:19] <Joanna> Which city designs didn’t work?
[16:05:24] <_inky> same with IT. we try alchemy now.
[16:05:32] <_inky> so much to tell, Joanna!
[16:05:41] <_inky> for example, wide roads.
[16:05:53] <_inky> other example, high rise residential buildings.
[16:05:56] <_inky> car oriented cities.
[16:06:17] <_inky> apparently when you make a wider road, you cannot solve the problem with traffic jams.
[16:06:23] <Joanna> Corbustier towers with freeways
[16:06:27] <_inky> just there are more cars, and you need to increase the road again
[16:06:45] <_inky> also, there are bottlenecks anyway, so the wide road should narrow at some point anyway.
[16:06:54] <_inky> yes, in particular.
[16:07:08] <_inky> and high rise neighbourds should be very expensive to be ok.
[16:08:04] <Joanna> Wide road problem is easy to solve just remove 4 lanes for bike and trolley lines and make the rest into a park like the Koreans were doing road diets
[16:08:17] <_inky> and even in this case, if people don't like where they live, they'll go to other districs of the city, and these high rise building blocks become gettoes, pretty unsafe, pretty empty, nobody wants to be on the street, that makes the another spiral in unsafety.
[16:08:52] <_inky> i believe you don't want wide roads in the city at all. and mostly cities should be bicycle and tram oriented.
[16:08:58] <_inky> whatever, if we talk about IT
[16:09:18] <_inky> then the greatest economy in the world was USA, and they were producing computers and operating systems.
[16:09:25] <Joanna> Did you ever have a look at the book in the topic about urban design? High rise buildings are a disaster if they don’t have a large team of people maintaining them.
[16:09:33] <_inky> so you would buy a computer by american design. with american os. with american language.
[16:09:58] <_inky> and i think americans like liberalism very much, very intuitively they designed a language - C, which allows you to shoot in your foot.
[16:10:27] <_inky> Joanna: that's my passion, i know a lot about urban design. if i didn't know my city is hopeless, i would run for a mayor. (:
[16:10:53] <_inky> in europe people are different. and the languages they designed were different.
[16:11:00] <_inky> lets take C library interfaces.
[16:11:05] <_inky> we didn't know what we are doing back then.
[16:11:06] <Joanna> I think corbustier was French and that’s the modern city architecture. Why people went along with his stupid ideas is beyond me
[16:11:14] <_inky> it was an early stage of IT. and yet still we have the same.
[16:11:19] <_inky> because we cannot change the interfaces.
[16:11:25] <_inky> getchar returns char or error code.
[16:11:26] <_inky> why?
[16:11:37] <_inky> because we didn't know how to design interfaces back then.
[16:12:00] <_inky> but many youngsters romanticize C because it is the language of the operating system.
[16:12:16] <Joanna> It’s good to have backwards compatibility
[16:12:45] <Joanna> People who use c think they are superior
[16:12:47] <_inky> because of backwards compatibility we stuck with C.
[16:13:08] <Joanna> What about pascal or ada?
[16:13:15] <_inky> and firefox is written in C++. and Mozilla decided to rewrite it it Rust, eventually, but they don't have enough resources so they closed the project.
[16:13:34] <_inky> Ada is much better. Still, Wirth thinks Ada is too fat to be good.
[16:13:46] <_inky> I don't know. I always hang out in Ada channel, and I love the people.
[16:14:05] <_inky> I never wrote Ada but it looks good. My friend 'dsar' from #oberon chat room
[16:14:18] <_inky> was working with Ada and considers it very evil, because it is too ambigous and complicated.
[16:14:27] <_inky> People who write Ada think they use Pascal on steroids.
[16:14:27] <Joanna> Why is ada so rare ? Wasnt it once an important programming language?
[16:14:35] <_inky> no, it was never.
[16:14:46] <_inky> first it was limited to DoD.
[16:14:54] <_inky> and it was hard to pass the certification, etc.
[16:15:02] <_inky> and then C and C++ already took the market.
[16:15:33] <Joanna> They stopped teaching it.
[16:15:40] <_inky> Pascal was once successful in USA market, brought there by Europeans. But they never considered other platfroms other than Dos/Windows.
[16:15:52] <_inky> and because it was driven by humans...
[16:15:58] <_inky> you know the first problem is humans.
[16:16:02] <_inky> humans want too many things.
[16:16:14] <_inky> so why C++ is so fat? because humans want features.
[16:16:30] <_inky> and in ISO comitee there are representatives of different organizations.
[16:16:39] <_inky> they need to justify the money their companies spend on them.
[16:16:39] <Joanna> There are obviously people who prefer that languages be less secure so they can sneak in malware
[16:16:51] <_inky> and they say 'you know in our organization we'd like to have such a c++ feature'
[16:16:59] <_inky> then they have that, and that, and that.
[16:17:06] <_inky> and they become fat. they have everything.
[16:17:15] <_inky> but they cannot get rid of backwards compatibility.
[16:17:16] <_inky> usually.
[16:17:22] <Joanna> Features are part of evolution
[16:17:26] <_inky> and Pascal ISO standard is much better, because noone is interested in it.
[16:17:45] <_inky> but Pascal as we know from Delphi is also complicated, big, fat langugase, not enough... i would say
[16:17:50] <_inky> consistency.
[16:18:01] <_inky> because humans were wanting features.
[16:18:24] <_inky> and company was developing the Pascal by giving more and more features, while
[16:18:31] <_inky> preserving backward compatibility too often.
[16:18:37] <_inky> so we have how many types of strings?
[16:18:39] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Quit: ᗧ•··ᗣ·ｂａｂｙ·🍒·•ｉ＇ｍ·♝··•ｂｏｒｅｄ·🍍·•··♞··ᗤ ᗣᗣᗣᗣ▀▄)
[16:18:41] <_inky> it's a mess.
[16:19:04] <_inky> that's why i don't like our Pascal, and I'd like fpc to finish ISO standard pascal, which is much more consistent and clean.
[16:19:15] <_inky> and i would with pleasure write only by using that subset.
[16:19:36] <_inky> then i'd know that the code i wrote in ISO Pascal is much more managable that the code I wrote when everything is allowed.
[16:19:40] <Joanna> There are a lot of strings for sure
[16:19:49] <_inky> Also, Pascal is copying C++ features all the time now. Because of the Embarcadero.
[16:20:08] <_inky> They introduced class operators, where you can define that '+' for your class means calling that method.
[16:20:11] <Joanna> I don’t mind the //
[16:20:14] <_inky> then they introduced namespace variables.
[16:20:34] <_inky> and interestingly, fpc team was against it. it was over red lines for fpc team.
[16:20:53] <_inky> and they did not implement that feature in fpc deliberately.
[16:21:40] <_inky> that's why I like Modula-3 and Oberon.
[16:21:41] <Joanna> I don’t understand namespace variables.
[16:21:49] <_inky> Oberon, I understand, is very much minimalistic for most of the people.
[16:21:53] <_inky> I like it for minimalism.
[16:22:08] <_inky> but Modula-3 has generics, has exceptions, has parallelism on the language level, so
[16:22:15] <_inky> it has everything modern programmers would like to have.
[16:22:19] <Joanna> Can you make a gui application in Oberon?
[16:22:23] <_inky> but of course it has no community and has no tool like Lazarus.
[16:22:31] <_inky> that's what i was coming to.
[16:22:42] <_inky> yes, but it's hard, you have no library and toolset like LCL and Lazarus.
[16:23:00] <_inky> or, there is i windows tool, called Blackbox Component Builder.
[16:23:13] <_inky> it uses Oberon dialect they call Component Pascal for marketing reasons.
[16:23:25] <_inky> they have very easy way of contructing interfaces.
[16:23:33] <_inky> you map a variable to the edit box.
[16:23:42] <_inky> and you map a button to a function. very easy.
[16:23:51] <_inky> but it's small, you don't have a lot of controls.
[16:24:04] <Joanna> Most people are not content with console programs
[16:24:05] <_inky> it was windows only for years, and now there is an experimental Linux build.
[16:24:07] <_inky> i don't recommend it.
[16:24:40] <_inky> so, i have a small example of how to use GTK directly with one of the Oberon compilers. But I only created a window and one button.
[16:24:43] <_inky> nothing more. 
[16:25:02] <_inky> It's a lot of work to wrap GTK and create beautiful interface, and I am not an expert in such things.
[16:25:13] <_inky> that can be done.
[16:25:15] <_inky> but probably not by me.
[16:25:44] <_inky> so remember i said i ported my lazarus phone app to android via delphi?
[16:25:49] <_inky> i uploaded it to play market.
[16:25:49] <Joanna> It can’t compete if it doesn’t do gui I’m afraid.
[16:26:00] <_inky> well, Golang also is weak with guis.
[16:26:06] <_inky> but it is mostly used for other things.
[16:26:12] <_inky> but i cannot compete not because of GUI
[16:26:17] <_inky> or not me.
[16:26:19] <_inky> Oberon.
[16:26:25] <_inky> but because it has no support from big powers.
[16:26:41] <_inky> every language today that is widespread, has community and libraries, has support of a big company.
[16:26:50] <_inky> google - go, java - sun, oracle, 
[16:26:51] <_inky> c++ - many
[16:26:56] <Joanna> Right
[16:27:01] <_inky> rust - mozilla
[16:27:04] <_inky> swift - apple.
[16:27:09] <_inky> that's the biggest problem.
[16:27:17] <_inky> oberon was left behind academic walls.
[16:27:20] <_inky> nobody was interested.
[16:27:34] <_inky> some people from university founded that company - oberon microsystems, that produced Blackbox.
[16:27:46] <_inky> they even managed to find some 'orders', they created software for
[16:27:52] <_inky> controllisg swiss roads
[16:28:10] <_inky> they wrote java virtual machine for windows mobile (that very old windows mobile, not windows phone)
[16:28:15] <_inky> it was called jbed.
[16:28:24] <_inky> it was written in oberon, or component pascal, which is almost the same.
[16:28:42] <_inky> and they wrote monitoring software in oberon for the biggest hydro power plant in brasil.
[16:28:53] <_inky> and they did not have enough clients, eventually open sourced the project.
[16:28:55] <_inky> and that's it.
[16:28:58] <_inky> they tried.
[16:29:02] <_inky> but it's hard to make such a businness.
[16:29:02] <Joanna> This is interesting but I need to go afk I’ll read what you are saying when I get back
[16:29:06] <_inky> i need too.
[16:29:08] <_inky> see you!

[16:47:35] <CalimeroTeknik> there's a point where I would have no qualms just breaking my way through, too; I mean 41h
[16:48:04] <jan6> _inky: are you aware of Zig? how do you think it stacks against other stuff, like, say, oberon?
[16:49:47] <_inky> hey, sorry i am afk
[16:50:00] <jan6> yeah, you CAN, if you know what you're doing, exit elevators from on top and stuff
[16:50:26] <_inky> but zig doesn't have modules, and it still uses headers.
[16:50:29] <_inky> which is old design.

[16:50:36] <_inky> it could be much better.

[16:56:52] <jan6> and Joanna, something that doesn't seem to be done much these days, but is a necessity imho, is to always have manual fallbacks, at least to some extent, like, with planes, default operation can be computerized, sure...but still have some lever or stuff that physically engages one of the steering apparatus to the plane, which'd work with power failture too... etc, the fallbacks don't have to be
[16:56:53] <jan6> comfortable, but they should be there, maybe you love self-driving cars... but they should still include a manual override option, if nothing else, then you might need to navigate some cluttered area, maybe full of debris, that the AI wouldn't have a clue about... but of course dual-systems are expensive enough people don't ever bother...
