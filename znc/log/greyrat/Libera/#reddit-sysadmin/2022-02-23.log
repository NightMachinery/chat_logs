[00:00:10] <signofzeta> Officially, 128 GB is the minimum for Exchange 2019, but without mailboxes, who cares.
[00:00:29] <Kiernian> holy crap, that went up
[00:02:04] <PublicWifi> I've heard of most people doing 32GB or less without issue
[00:02:05] <signofzeta> yeah, they got sick of people buying Exchange for, like, 10-person companies.
[00:02:19] <signofzeta> Exchange vNext is another example
[00:02:20] <PublicWifi> if you read the fine print they say 128GB based on 5000 mailboxes
[00:02:24] <sd> 14<K​illnine> We just got off exchange 2019 for 19 people...lol
[00:02:28] <PublicWifi> or some shit
[00:02:34] <signofzeta> which I did not, only the Microsoft docs (without fine print)
[00:02:37] <PublicWifi> they are trying to scare smaller businesses into going to o365
[00:02:49] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Honestly it ran fine
[00:02:56] <signofzeta> and if you can afford it, just say fuck it.
[00:03:12] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> I ran 1000 user company on 64g of ram on Exchange 2019
[00:03:14] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> it ran fine
[00:03:16] <PublicWifi> their plan worked on signofzeta haha
[00:03:17] <signofzeta> The only problem with these published system requirements is that they can look at those and try denying you support if you don't meet them.
[00:03:24] <PublicWifi> saw teh 128Gb, was like damn! and didn't look into it
[00:03:24] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> never could figure out why they're like "GIVE ME ALL THE RAM"
[00:03:27] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> what are they, chrome?
[00:03:30] <PublicWifi> like 90% of small businesses would do
[00:03:50] <signofzeta> PublicWifi: Lol, just pay the OpEx 365 tax and call it a day at this point.
[00:03:54] <PublicWifi> ^
[00:03:57] <PublicWifi> I want to so bad lol
[00:04:08] <PublicWifi> been hammering it in to my boss' head for a while
[00:04:12] <PublicWifi> inb4 fritzwastaken makes that gay somehow
[00:04:19] <signofzeta> And now, Exchange vNext will be subscription-based.  Launching in 2H 2021.  Eventually.
[00:04:23] <cryptic1> can you not

[00:05:01] <PublicWifi> oh
[00:05:14] <PublicWifi> well its hard to convince the boss to go o365 when we have 3 years of extended support on exchange 2016 left lol
[00:05:28] <PublicWifi> whoa extended supported for 2019 ends the same day 2016 does?
[00:05:30] <PublicWifi> that's weird
[00:05:35] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yep
[00:05:38] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> cuz fuck you, thats why
[00:05:43] <PublicWifi> you only get 1 year of ext support for exchange 2019 LOL
[00:06:30] <signofzeta> vNext = "Version Next".  It's pending a name.
[00:06:47] <Kiernian> yeah, I think that's what they call them all, now.
[00:07:06] * DrGibby farts https://gibbyfarts.com/#nft
[00:07:15] <PublicWifi> wait is exchange 2021 not gonna be a thing
[00:07:17] <PublicWifi> or 2022 or whatever
[00:07:25] <Kiernian> sharepoint, version next. teams, version next. it's just their lingo for "unnamed future release"
[00:07:37] <PublicWifi> 2019 is the last onprem exchange??
[00:07:38] <signofzeta> MSFT said we'd have Exchange "vNext" last year.  Still waiting.
[00:07:47] * fritzwastaken farts https://gibbyfarts.com/#nft
[00:08:01] <signofzeta> I guess they were still bribing SF's and NYC's mayors to get people back into the office because Teams still kinda sucks.
[00:08:12] <PublicWifi> ohhh
[00:08:25] <PublicWifi> exchange 2019 will upgrade to "vnext" and itll be an ongoing support type deal forever?

[13:03:14] <Cl0udNinja> kerat58, haha yep... we did the same

[13:04:12] *** Quits: Joe-Developer (~Joe-Devel@user/joe-developer) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:04:27] <Cl0udNinja> we're a software/hardware provider for a storage solution, we make our images via ZFS send/receive and dd images that go to production/manufacturing.
[13:04:48] <kerat58> ah ok
[13:04:55] <kerat58> so it was more like 'proprietary-to-cloud'
[13:05:16] <Cl0udNinja> our process to create images that we found was to use chroot installs in the clouds
[13:05:27] <kerat58> yes
[13:05:39] <Cl0udNinja> packer does not have chroot install processes, that follow the AWS ebssurrogate processes
[13:05:45] <Cl0udNinja> for azure/gcp
[13:05:57] <kerat58> yep...i was dealing with ovh ;)
[13:06:03] <kerat58> reallly Not A Good Time
[13:06:03] <Cl0udNinja> I ended up hackifying bash scripts and cli to make it work for now
[13:06:47] <Cl0udNinja> we are now about to start writing our own tooling that we may make public (not sure on that yet) to replace packer and the scripts that I wrote, using hcl language for the definitions
[13:06:59] <kerat58> In  OVH cloud: Can I mount a live CD?   (12 hours later through ticket only -> "Nope!")
[13:07:11] <kerat58> Can we pay for a support incident?  ("Nope! We don't do support")
[13:07:16] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:07:26] <CptLuxx> time for a new provider eh?
[13:07:29] <kerat58> Can you do anything?  ("Not really; unless you have a network or hardware issue;)
[13:07:36] <kerat58> uggggggh
[13:07:38] <Cl0udNinja> yeah put a second disk, dd it, chroot and update initramfs and grub
[13:07:55] <kerat58> I wanted to tell 'em to burn down the rest of their DCS

[13:11:39] <Cl0udNinja> its a bit of an undertaking, but we ultimately decided that it was better than the shit we had to continue putting up with if we left what I had as it was

[13:12:21] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> Morning
[13:12:41] <kerat58> The main issue being that if you do not "start" in a standardised cloud environment, it is harder to get a mature solution converted over
[13:12:47] <Cl0udNinja> I hate all of the cloud providers for not having a single standard for some certain stuff, like naming and such
[13:12:58] <kerat58> yes, that too
[13:13:23] <kerat58> they all reinvent the wheel, and partially to keep you in their cloud instead of jumping ship into somewhere else
[13:13:28] <Cl0udNinja> yea
[13:13:33] <Cl0udNinja> I fucking hate azure 
[13:13:35] <kerat58> hahahaha

[13:14:26] <Oliber> sounds about right, love it
[13:14:33] <kerat58> You wouldn't need versioning labels if you used this metadata service.  $0.01 per request, or $0.05/request in the Singapore-Australia availability zone

[13:32:56] <teh_f4ll3n> fair
[13:33:25] <Cl0udNinja> and I had to learn CAD to make the enclosure
[13:33:35] <Cl0udNinja> or design it anyway
[13:33:45] <kerat58> wow
[13:34:43] <kerat58> i tried qcad years ago...when i was first getting into the IT sphere
[13:35:01] <kerat58> a friend ~100x better than me did it and said i should try
[13:35:11] <kerat58> The suggestion, while well-intentioned, was wrong.
[13:35:40] <Cl0udNinja> Joe-Developer, I always wanted to get people to play powerdown bingo, but everyone always scared about losing their jobs or something.... Get rack and U ids for servers in a location, and then you put all of them into a hat or whatever, draw them out. as the numbers come up, you power down stuff. if a servers powered down that you had on your card, and the customer complains within 5 minutes, you get to put an X down
[13:35:57] <kerat58> Oh WOW
[13:35:57] <Cl0udNinja> kerat58, I used FreeCAD, and then for the electronics, KiCad
[13:36:04] <kerat58> powerdown bingo
[13:36:09] <kerat58> man, that is a great "happy trails" party idea
[13:36:10] <Joe-Developer> oh
[13:36:10] <Joe-Developer> my
[13:36:18] <Joe-Developer> that sounds amazing
[13:36:37] <Joe-Developer> dont see what there is to be scared about

[13:36:54] <kerat58> That is, the softer more polite version
[13:37:08] <kerat58> Same concept but the IDs are power supplies
[13:37:19] <kerat58> Game lasts way longer
[13:37:21] <Cl0udNinja> lol pray for non redundant systems
[13:37:26] <kerat58> Nothing goes down until 2 PDUs are pulled
[13:37:36] <kerat58> we all golf clap when 1 does go down
[13:37:51] <Cl0udNinja> actually the best game I've ever played, and I've played twice ever in my life, is vehicular hide and seek
[13:37:52] <Joe-Developer> HAHA
[13:37:57] <kerat58> Then we all get hammered at the "club" after it is over
[13:38:09] <kerat58> under the guise that the burger I just ate will "sop up" all the beer
[13:38:58] <kerat58> Vehicular hide and seek.  Tesla model 3 in a mid-sized city.  Gogogogo
[13:38:58] <Cl0udNinja> You get 2 or more people per car, pick a neighborhood, and then you do group calling for shit talking. one car is the seeker, everyone else hides. you can run, but no speeding, and have to obey limits. if you run, you have to get to the safe spot before the seeker does.
[13:39:38] <kerat58> something tells me that Cl0udNinja has lived a life 300x more interesting than 3/4ths of this channel
[13:39:38] <Cl0udNinja> was by far one of the most fun nights I've ever had. we got to play like 4 or 5 rounds in a couple of hours. we had set boundaries and all
[13:40:32] <kerat58> two people per car minimum is awesome.  Imagine having a secret alley where you stop and smoke a cigarette, casually listening to make sure noone is getting close
[13:40:33] <kerat58> lol
[13:41:03] <Cl0udNinja> no one can exit the car except to take a piss. the reason for the two is for keeping watch, and the driver can keep their eyes on the road if they're moving
[13:41:21] <kerat58> don't need to exit if you have a piss jug
[13:41:23] <kerat58> :)
[13:41:27] <Cl0udNinja> gross
[13:41:31] <kerat58> hahahaha
[13:42:11] <kerat58> it's the way of the road
[13:42:56] <kerat58> how big of an area was the boundaries of this game btw?
[13:43:15] <Cl0udNinja> about a half to full square mile
[13:43:33] <Cl0udNinja> basically we'd pick major cross streets as the boundaries
[13:43:54] <Cl0udNinja> we had 8 or 9 cars the second night we played
[13:44:45] <kerat58> man
[13:45:05] <kerat58> talk about creativity
[13:45:50] <Cl0udNinja> midwest, tired of bars and drinking, couldnt think of anything else to do so we started makin our own games
[13:46:21] <kerat58> So how do you win?
[13:46:41] <Cl0udNinja> last car to be spotted, or if the seeker calls out that they give up
[13:46:52] <SirSceptalot> What the fuck is up with that youtube shorts bullsjeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
[13:46:54] <Cl0udNinja> you can get hints as the seeker, but they may not always be true
[13:47:04] <kerat58> SirSceptalot:  ugh.....
[13:47:17] <kerat58> it is google/youtube 'bullying' youtubers into making TikTok like clips 
[13:47:23] <Cl0udNinja> gas was also cheap at the time, so one of the rules was headlights on to make spotting easier at night
[13:47:24] <SirSceptalot> did they just start brainstorming how they could make youtube worse?
[13:47:30] <kerat58> if you don't do enough Shorts, your channel revenue magically fall
[13:48:32] <SirSceptalot> but i'm not even sure that it's video's made that way, it looks like it's just regular video's that they cropped like a moron and disabled fullscreen
[13:49:15] <kerat58> well
[13:49:18] <kerat58> thats the thing
[13:49:25] <kerat58> so like I said, the concept is punitive
[13:49:47] <kerat58> if you have an active channel but no shorts, the "algorithm" penalizes you, becuase now YouTive Competitiveness <> TikTok Competitiveness
[13:50:10] <SirSceptalot> je
[13:50:11] <SirSceptalot> sus
[13:50:12] <SirSceptalot> christ
[13:50:16] <SirSceptalot> that's dumb
[13:50:16] <kerat58> so what happened?  a lot of creators just took existing videos, grabbed clips, and made them into shorts
[13:50:22] <kerat58> some people make legit shorts
[13:50:24] <kerat58> but not all
[13:50:41] <kerat58> that wil continue until "the algorithm" detects repeat content (e.g., a short deriving from a previous 'long')
[13:51:25] <Cl0udNinja> alright, time to be dead. night you upside down aussie fuckers
[13:51:39] <SirSceptalot> oi I'm no kangourou
[13:51:42] <Cl0udNinja> or whatever whoevers still alive
[13:51:47] <Cl0udNinja> idk how timezones work anymore
[13:51:48] <Cl0udNinja> fuck time
[13:52:03] <SirSceptalot> just look it up in a youtube short
[13:52:36] <kerat58> lol
[13:52:54] <kerat58> yeah tbh I have a lot of issues with youtube
[13:53:18] <SirSceptalot> well disabling the downvote counter is also horrible for consumers
[13:53:59] <kerat58> bbbbbbbbbbut how are you going to watch 2-3 ads per video if you skip half the videos based on downvotes?
[13:55:26] <SirSceptalot> have you met our lord and savior, adblocker?
[13:56:05] <teh_f4ll3n> ad blocking is piracy (c)LTT
[13:56:14] <kerat58> uggg
[13:56:16] <kerat58> yes
[13:56:18] <kerat58> that guy...
[13:56:20] <SirSceptalot> :D
[13:56:38] <SirSceptalot> LTT talk
[13:56:42] <SirSceptalot> this gon be gud
[13:56:56] <SirSceptalot> just like how our sponsor is good, GLASSWIRE
[13:57:41] <kerat58> "hey watch me put a $5,000 wifi antenna on my parents' vacation home they use once a month.  Speaking of once a month, that is how frequently you will have to pay if you sign up for our sponsor!!!!  Sit through this, and the 2-3 standard youtube adds, while I toy around with hardware that vendors just send me, while you work away like a dumbass at your regular job!"
[13:58:24] <SirSceptalot> living the dream
[13:59:15] <kerat58> yes, and canadian to boot
[13:59:38] <kerat58> so no matter how youtube goes, he'll still have free health care 
[14:00:32] <SirSceptalot> I guess I could just report all youtube shorts that pop up in my search lists with "youtube shorts suck" as reason
[14:00:43] <kerat58> lol
[14:00:55] <kerat58> did a particualr short get you upset, or is this just a general observation/
[14:01:22] <teh_f4ll3n> well what do you know! AD is still broken as shit
[14:02:28] <SirSceptalot> I've just encountered about 2 or three of them while looking for something, and each time the were a correctly sized video that just got messed up to fit in the wrong (vertical) aspect ratio. Then I want to have a better look at the stuff on screen and I can't even fullscreen them
[14:03:04] <SirSceptalot> so, in "short", I'm just being a pantsy about it because I want to dictate what youtbe does with the free platform they provide
[14:04:06] <kerat58> lol

[18:02:53] <PublicWifi> yeah man its great for a free product
[18:02:54] <fritzwastaken> if I didnt use O365 for email I would use libre
[18:03:03] <PublicWifi> probably one of the most polished FOSS softwares out there
[18:03:20] <nx032> honestly im considering replacing some desktops with ubuntu, i just need a way to manage the security settings remotely
[18:03:47] <nx032> libreoffice is pretty great but does lack some nice features that microsoft has added to excel over the years
[18:04:00] <PublicWifi> yeah we aren't accountants or anything
[18:04:16] <PublicWifi> so we don't use a lot of the more advanced excel features

[18:25:16] <layer8> lancehead meant: "I am so aroused "
[18:25:22] <mistiry> starting from the right
[18:25:32] <mistiry> those are valued at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc.
[18:25:36] <lancehead> yeah I get that part 
[18:25:49] <mistiry> so if you have, say, 00001001
[18:25:56] <mistiry> you would add 1 + 8
[18:26:05] <mistiry> because theres a 1 in the 1 spot and the 8 spot
[18:26:08] <lancehead> yeah that's not the part i'm having trouble with 
[18:26:11] <mistiry> so 00001001 = 9

[18:26:20] <mistiry> you said you didnt know how to count in binary
[18:26:21] <PublicWifi> lancehead: say you have decimal 8, 8 divided by 2 is 4, with a remainder of 0

[18:31:37] <PublicWifi> i told you
[18:31:39] <PublicWifi> okay listn
[18:31:44] <lancehead> I KNOW IT'S 0000111 IN 8

[18:31:52] <lancehead> wait that was wrong 
[18:31:54] <PublicWifi> youre thinking too hard
[18:31:56] <lancehead> 0001011 
[18:32:00] <PublicWifi> okay so whats 11 divided by 2?
[18:32:01] <mistiry> 1011
[18:32:05] <mistiry> in binary 
[18:32:07] <mistiry> is 11
[18:32:08] <PublicWifi> 5 with a remainder of 1 right?
[18:32:18] <lancehead> oh wait 
[18:32:18] <Kiernian> so in four digit binary, the places are 8 4 2 1
[18:32:22] <PublicWifi> so our first number is a 1, 00000001
[18:32:24] <lancehead> so mistiry what you're telling me is 
[18:32:28] <Kiernian> so which of those numbers add up to 11?
[18:32:29] <lancehead> i literally just take the right half of that octet
[18:32:33] <mistiry> a binary number with less than 8 numbers can be assumed to have leading 0s
[18:32:33] <Kiernian> change those numbers from 0 to 1
[18:32:43] <PublicWifi> you add the hex together
[18:32:44] <Kiernian> 8+2+1=11 so 1011
[18:32:44] <lancehead> well that just explains everything 
[18:32:47] <mistiry> 1011 is the same as 00001011
[18:32:49] <PublicWifi> before converting to binary
[18:32:54] <lancehead> now i get it 
[18:32:57] <Oliber> 8+0+2+1 = furteen

[18:34:04] <lancehead> 1111
[18:34:05] <Kiernian> leftmost places are higher 
[18:34:06] <Oliber> i just wanted to see if furteen would upset people, i can't even count
[18:34:08] <mjt> PublicWifi: nice
[18:34:12] <PublicWifi> lancehead: D would be BUT you isn't your ocetet actually 2 nibbles?
[18:34:16] <PublicWifi> aka 2 digit hex
[18:34:23] <lancehead> yeah 
[18:34:25] <Kiernian> rightmost place is always 1
[18:34:26] <PublicWifi> so you'd add your 2 hexs together first
[18:34:33] <mistiry> Kiernian: no its not
[18:34:38] <mistiry> binary 0 is 00000000
[18:34:44] <mjt> 110100100
[18:34:55] <mistiry> binary 4 would be 0000100
[18:34:57] <mistiry> etc
[18:34:58] <lancehead> so if I take D6 for example that's 19 and then I make THAT binary? @ PublicWifi
[18:35:05] <Kiernian> nono, rightmost place is always the value for one, whether it's a 0 or a 1 is whether the 1's place is "on"
[18:35:28] <mistiry> oh
[18:35:30] <mistiry> yeah
[18:35:34] <lancehead> So D6 would beeeeee bear with me here 
[18:35:36] <Kiernian> sorry, I said it poorly
[18:35:41] <lancehead> 00010011
[18:35:50] <mistiry> yes
[18:35:51] <lancehead> for 19
[18:35:52] <mistiry> thats 19
[18:35:54] <lancehead> I AM
[18:35:55] <lancehead> A GENIUS
[18:36:06] <Kiernian> doesn't it feel like a superpower when that finally clicks? haha
[18:36:06] <lancehead> that's so much faster now thanks 
[18:36:10] <mistiry> or we are, because we helped you learn it :D
[18:36:10] <Joe-Developer> Welcome to todays class: Binary with #reddit-sysadmin. Take a seat and remember all classes are recorded and can be accessed on the VLE at any point. :)
[18:36:19] <lancehead> OH GOD NO
[18:36:21] <mistiry> lancehead: but glad it makes sense now
[18:36:32] <lancehead> so am I lol 
[18:36:49] <lancehead> I almost feel confident about my exams 
[18:36:52] <lancehead> Just 7 chapters left 
[18:36:56] <Joe-Developer> sometimes it just takes the right way of something being explained to click
[18:37:00] <lancehead> And then the entirety of CCNA2
[18:37:03] <lancehead> (help)
[18:37:06] <mistiry> hex is a bitch, but binary is simple once you understand how it works
[18:37:06] <Joe-Developer> and different people have different views and ways of expliaining shit
[18:37:09] <mistiry> which isnt all that hard really
[18:37:32] <lancehead> I'm so going to try and fail to explain this to my SO when I come home 
[18:37:35] <mistiry> and then when you grow up, you just use google to look all that up anyways
[18:37:49] <mjt> nek minut takes the test and they ask about qubits
[18:37:53] <Joe-Developer> and when google doesn't work you come in here and ask
[18:37:55] <Joe-Developer> B)
[18:38:06] <Kiernian> i found hex to be easy once I understood that the letters represent numbers and what someone really meant when they said "base x" number system. I was hacking final fantasy legend 2 on gameboy with my game genie at 7, reverse engineering the codes LOL

[18:40:28] <Kiernian> lol

[18:42:08] <fritzwastaken> yea thats part of it

[18:42:54] <lancehead> My weechat is super pretty too 
[18:43:02] <mistiry> first client was MS Comic Chat, then I learned it was really this thing called IRC, and so learned from there how to connect with mIRC
[18:43:03] <Kiernian> or a windows store app. I hate those
[18:43:06] <PublicWifi> weechat can do that

[18:52:20] <Kiernian> did someone buy them?

[18:53:32] <technonerd> i still havent figured that one out, maybe resist fingerprinting

[18:53:37] <PublicWifi> yes
[18:53:42] <lancehead> okay good 
[18:53:47] <nx032> i dont trust brave, vibes are off
[18:53:55] <lancehead> so 19 
[18:53:56] <PublicWifi> its just hex notation essentially
[18:54:01] <PublicWifi> so you can tell its hex by looking at it
[18:54:09] <Kiernian> I have tried brave. I don't like it, but I don't really like anything chromium based and huh, okay, I'm not the only one who got bad vibes from it
[18:54:11] <lancehead> wait wtf that's not an option 
[18:54:14] <lancehead> does the 0x mean anything
[18:54:20] <mistiry> just denotes hex

[18:54:24] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lancehead did you just learn about hex?
[18:54:36] <PublicWifi> its just a prefix that tells you the number is hex lancehead 
[18:54:37] <lancehead> well no, just never had to do maths with it 
[18:54:38] <PublicWifi> nothing more
[18:54:41] <mistiry> F is 15 not 16
[18:54:43] <nx032> i had ff but something kept glitching so i switched to chrome
[18:54:47] <lancehead> right so 18 
[18:54:48] <mistiry> so 3F is 18
[18:54:50] <lancehead> that's still not an option 
[18:55:02] <Kiernian> i stick to firefox for everything that will function in it. A few really poorly smashed together sites won't work in it with noscript on (like imgur) though.
[18:55:05] <lancehead> it gives me 87, 77, 93, 63
[18:55:10] <mistiry> ah
[18:55:17] <mistiry> its 63
[18:55:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Also 0b is used to indicate binary like 0x is for hex

[18:55:38] <lancehead> what 
[18:55:39] <lancehead> how is it 63 
[18:55:47] <nx032> i use ff for some plugins like stream detector when downloading webinars and other stuff management wants

[18:56:12] <PublicWifi> you have the hex conversion equation right lancehead ?
[18:56:32] <lancehead> oh
[18:56:34] <lancehead> right
[18:56:38] <mistiry> lancehead: 3*16 + F*16

[23:31:39] <catbeard> best is walmart's internal system, when i broke into it, it was running worldwide on windows 2000 server pro

[23:32:02] <mistiry> probably still the same system

[23:32:17] <catbeard> they were like take this training module and let us know when you're done

[23:33:11] <catbeard> voila logged in, modules passed
[23:33:28] <Reventlov> mistiry: that's not the question. With kerberos (and a pam module, yeah, and some ldap database), I still need to preconfigure machines with secrets (keytabs)
[23:33:48] <catbeard> i think there was some login screen bypass with the print menu too
[23:38:43] <mistiry> Reventlov: yes, in order to bind to LDAP you will need to have a DN and password (or other authentication mechanism, e.g. certs) on the system you are binding to the LDAP host
