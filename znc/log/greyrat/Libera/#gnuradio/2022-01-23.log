[01:05:33] <muaddib[m]> It would obviously be very valuable to be able to compile a flowgraph into an executable.
[01:06:37] <drmpeg> It's a cool idea. But it has to be finished to be useful.
[01:07:21] <drmpeg> Everybody tries it and it fails miserably.

[01:38:31] <Hash[m]> And what OS?

[01:40:38] <Hash[m]> Good call, stick with Ubuntu for now, adding another OS just complicates an already complicated setup

[01:51:38] <warnes[m]> The challenge is getting GR + BladeRF working..
[01:52:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> Have you considered using it via Soapy or gr-osmosdr?
[01:52:17] <warnes[m]> I think I have just plain too many different attempt to install everything, and I need to clean up and start from a fresh Ubuntu install.
[01:52:40] <warnes[m]> I can connect and stream samples using Soapy.
[01:52:52] <warnes[m]> Haven't really tried gr-osmosdr yet.
[01:53:38] <patchvonbraun[m]> Ubuntu 21.10 has soapy and gr-osmosdr
[01:53:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> And gr3.8.2
[01:55:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> Iâ€™ve used it with Lime and RTL and USRP and AirSpy without problems. I donâ€™t have a BadeRf or HackRF.
[01:56:16] <Hash[m]> Nice, been using 20.04 myself but maybe time to upgrade
[01:56:52] <Hash[m]> warnes[m]: If you can stream using soapy you should be good, unless you are looking for some other functionality?
[01:57:35] <Hash[m]> <Jacob[m]12> "GR has dockers too" <- You use them to run multiple versions? Work well?
[01:58:04] <warnes[m]> Frankly, I'm not sure which way is best, via gr-bladerf, soapy, or osmosdr.
[01:59:32] <warnes[m]> I had hoped to be able to use gr-bladerf so I could take advantage of the full feature set, but I suppose that is an 'optimizatiton' that should wait until later on.
[02:02:31] <Jacob[m]12> Hash[m]: Yeah, pretty easily. Helps if you are familiar with docker
[02:03:41] <warnes[m]> I'm trying to use the two TX and RX channels on the bladeRF to simulate two separate OFDM TX/RX stations so I can benchmark some changes to the OFDM PHY later with an eye to setting up a pseudo 802.11 arrangement using my custom PHY later with one STA and multiple APs.

[02:41:09] <warnes[m]> @muadib I'll give that a quick try.
[02:44:15] <muaddib[m]> I forgot to mention that part. The build process I just described will have the quickest path to failure IF something goes wrong. So you wonâ€™t have to spend 2 1/2 days before deciding to start over. 
[02:44:16] <muaddib[m]> Since youâ€™ll be using GR 3.9 you also wonâ€™t have to deal with any cryptic swig issues either!
[02:47:29] <warnes[m]> I didn't realize soapy had been mainlined.

[03:04:41] <warnes[m]> Does the PPA for 3.10 work OK?
[03:04:46] <warnes[m]> Or should I stick with 3.9?
[03:22:43] <muaddib[m]> I havenâ€™t used the PPA for 3.10 yet so I donâ€™t know. It just got officially released as a stable build the other day.
[03:22:43] <muaddib[m]> I would say If you already have a project in mind that uses any OOT blocks, they may not be supported in 3.10 yet and could take a bit to get ported (if they do at all). 
[03:23:20] <warnes[m]> Good point. I do want to make use of gr-802.11
[03:25:33] <warnes[m]> Hmm.  Actually, did the API change much between 3.9 and 3.10.  The module porting guide doesn't show a lot of changes...
[03:26:00] *** Quits: kilitary (~kilitary@188.242.187.4) (Quit: entering irc ...)
[03:26:09] <drmpeg> Not much. Most 3.9 OOT's will work fine.
[03:28:14] <jogn_1[m]> Whats the rules for compatibility just curious? Because i know some OOTs you can run, and some you cant?
[03:29:45] <jogn_1[m]> Lets say you have a 3.7 or 3.8 OOT, and are trying to run it on 3.9 would that work?
[03:30:39] <drmpeg> No. 3.7 and 3.8 use SWIG, so that's a deal breaker.

[03:35:31] <drmpeg> Basically, except for 3.9 -> 3.10, they're all incompatible.
[03:37:41] <drmpeg> But there are things like Gqrx that builds on any version.
[03:37:52] <jogn_1[m]> drmpeg: that does suck though, because some OOTs don't have updates :P but I guess, that being said its not much work to make old versions compatiable I guess?
[03:38:30] <drmpeg> It is painful.
[03:38:55] <drmpeg> For most OOT's, it's not too difficult to convert.
[03:38:57] <jogn_1[m]> Who knows, maybe a tool in the future is released that makes it easier? :P
[03:39:17] <drmpeg> You just use gr_modtool.
[03:40:09] <drmpeg> You create stubs with the same name as the old blocks.
[03:40:18] <jogn_1[m]> How is 3.10 doing so far? I haven't been keeping track with the git issues
[03:40:25] <jogn_1[m]> Are there any major bugs or is everything working?
[03:40:37] <drmpeg> And then just overwrite the stubs with the old blocks.

[03:40:54] <jogn_1[m]> Ah thats not that bad :P

[03:47:54] <muaddib[m]> I just remember 3.7 to 3.8 and then 3.8 to 3.9

[03:48:11] <drmpeg> Oh ok.
[03:48:17] <jogn_1[m]> when is 3.11 coming out? 
[03:48:30] <jogn_1[m]> ðŸ˜‚
[03:48:38] <drmpeg> Probably a ways off.
[03:49:36] <drmpeg> 3.9 to 3.10 was 1 year.
[03:54:37] <muaddib[m]> Plus thereâ€™s talk about 4.0 :-)
[03:55:31] <drmpeg> That's right. But it's a big change. You'll probably see another branch for that.
[03:56:08] <muaddib[m]> <jogn_1[m]> "that does suck though, because..." <- It should be mentioned that GRC files from gnuradio 3.7 can be opened in any of the new versions. Thereâ€™s a built in XML to yaml converter that works really really well. I opened up some of my old flowgraphs the other day. 
[03:56:27] <jogn_1[m]> muaddib[m]: :ooo
[03:57:20] <jogn_1[m]> muaddib[m]: inside information from muaddib, you guys heard it here first :D
[03:57:58] <drmpeg> It's public. https://github.com/gnuradio/newsched
[03:58:08] <jogn_1[m]> jogn_1[m]: I think they shared some information regarding the 4.0 in GNU radio conferences. I might have watched some of it
[04:01:53] <muaddib[m]> Yeah. If you watch the project update talk from this past September they talk about it.
[04:02:33] <warnes[m]> muaddib: I don't see the soapy blocks in gnuradio-companion 3.10 installed from the ppa.
[04:07:45] <jogn_1[m]> <warnes[m]> "muaddib: I don't see the soapy..." <- I haven
[04:07:55] <jogn_1[m]> * I haven't tried the 3.10 yet, but you might have to install https://github.com/pothosware/SoapyBladeRF (?)
[04:08:34] <jogn_1[m]> I know for a fact that osmocom source is not available anymore on the 3.10 version :P
[04:09:16] <warnes[m]> It looks like soapy is present in the 'master' PPA, but not in the 3.10 PPA.  Oversight, I presume?
[04:15:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> The nice thing about the way SoapySDR does things compared to gr-osmosdr, is that in gr-osmosdr, the driver libs have to be present when gr-osomosdr is built.  Whereas with SoapySDR, they're loaded dynamically at runtime.  So if you have a compatible loadable module, you just drop it in SoapySDRs  "modules" directory, and next time SoapySDR is loaded, it'll load all the modules.  This is hugely convenient.
[04:18:50] <warnes[m]> Hmm:  I'm getting a message about insecure repositories:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/5b1c08f7468aa8b292522751bb88e9d69721620d)
[04:25:58] <muaddib[m]> I donâ€™t know. Like I said I havenâ€™t installed that. I just use 3.9, I figure itâ€™s stable AND community vetted at this point.

[20:07:21] <Hash[m]> Jacob: In the FHSS flowgraph thereâ€™s a PDU FIR Filter right after the Center Freq Estimation. Iâ€™m trying to understand how the low pass filter taps work for that. Can you point me to anything?
[20:24:12] <Jacob[m]12> That is a channel filter
[20:24:14] <Jacob[m]12> It might be decimating by two. I'll have to take a look
[20:24:26] <Hash[m]> It is
[20:25:24] <Hash[m]> I set it to decimate by 4 and I receive a lot more data
[20:25:36] <muaddib[m]> <warnes[m]> "Updating software..." <- Any progress?
[20:25:37] <Jacob[m]12> Before the fine freq estimator you aren't really sure where exactly the burst is, so the BW is twice what you eventually want
[20:25:38] <Jacob[m]12> Then you center and decimate by two. Or are you asking how I arrived at the value for the taps
[20:26:00] <Jacob[m]12> Your signals are pretty narrow so that doesn't surprise me
[20:27:21] <Hash[m]> I was initially curious about how you got the values for the taps, but then changing the decimation and getting better results made me curious about the whole thing. I might need to add some visualization back into the flowgraph so I can see whatâ€™s happening
[20:29:03] <Jacob[m]12> Yeah I'm not quite sure why that would make a significant improvement. Probably just helps the clock recovery
[20:30:38] <Hash[m]> I was initially trying to play with the flowgraph to receive baud rates outside of 9600
[20:33:57] <Jacob[m]12> Basically those taps should just provide anti aliasing for the decimation
[20:35:08] <Jacob[m]12> It's 100% possible something is not quite right
[20:35:09] <Jacob[m]12> Adding a little instrumentation should make that clear
[20:36:05] <Hash[m]> K
[20:36:29] <Hash[m]> Thanks
[21:01:20] <clever> i was thinking, could you convert composite video into s-video, with just 2 analog filters, low-pass and high-pass?
[21:10:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> is the Chroma in S-Video QAM, just like in NTSC composite video?  If so, yeah, probably
[21:10:56] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: i believe it is, this converter does the reverse with just a single capacitor, https://www.epanorama.net/circuits/svideo2cvideo.html
[21:11:12] <clever> its just injecting the high-freq QAM ontop of the low-freq luma
[21:12:01] <clever> undoing that just requires some good edges on your filters
[21:12:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yup, so that would work
[21:12:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> You could also sample the composite signal and do the fitlering digitally
[21:13:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> But what would the motivation be these days?   Other than mucking-about with retro hardware?

[21:14:27] <cleverca22[m]> and this is an example of a display failing to set the edges correctly
[21:16:30] <cleverca22[m]> the 1st image is composite into an rf encoder(channel 3) into a crt tv, where high freq luma gets mis-interpreted as chroma
[21:16:32] <cleverca22[m]> the 2nd image is the same composite signal, fed directly into an lcd hdtv
[21:16:45] <cleverca22[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: just for trying to reduce how much a signal degrades over a cable, by seperating the luma and chroma as close to the source as possible, and yeah, for anything actually needing/wanting 480i

[21:28:34] <cleverca22[m]> and you can see the phase difference changing, and it instantly reveals that the tint knob is just a phase offset
[21:28:59] <cleverca22[m]> ahhh

[21:34:43] <Yamakaja[m]> Yes
[21:35:34] <cleverca22[m]> the greyscale one, is because the tv couldnt lock onto the wrong colorburst, and just decided to ignore all color data
[21:35:36] <cleverca22[m]> the rainbow one, is because it failed to lock, and just kept going with a different freq, so they went in and out of phase

[21:55:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> cleverca22: Different NTSC TV implementations had different robustness in the face of "weird" signals.  When you implemented your signal processing chain in vacuum-tubes and discrete components (and later transistors), certain design compromises had to be made.
[21:55:37] <cleverca22[m]> yeah
[21:56:30] <cleverca22[m]> the older tv above, is an xl-100, from what ive read, its one of the first all digital tv's
[21:59:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XL-100
[22:00:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> If it's that one, there's NO WAY IN HECK that it's "all digital".  Not.  Gonna. Happen.

[22:03:54] <cleverca22[m]> patchvonbraun: this matches mine the best
[22:04:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> The only "all digital" in that design might be the synthesizer used in the 1st IF.  
[22:04:38] <cleverca22[m]> and what you cant see is the 7-segment display for tuning
[22:04:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> The entire rest of the signal-processing chain would be entirely analog
[22:04:55] <cleverca22[m]> that sounds like the 7-segment tuner backs it up
[22:04:55] <patchvonbraun[m]> Even then the "digital" aspects would just be in setting the N and R values in the synthesizer
[22:07:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> A lot of late-1970s era TVs/Radios started having digital channel/frequency displays.  Because synthesizer technology had "caught on", and driving those synthesizers using a digital display was easy.  But the actual signal processing chain was entirely analog
