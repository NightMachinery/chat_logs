[00:02:46] <average> Ethos: well.. p needn't even be a prime..
[00:02:54] <Ethos> But i am looking for an elemental proof without modular arithmetic
[00:02:58] <average> Ethos: pick three consecutive numbers, one of them is bound to be a multiple of three
[00:03:29] <Ethos> Yeah i know, i am asking if that should require a "proof"
[00:03:49] <average> Ethos: their residues module 3 are either {0,1,2} or {1,2,0} or {2,1,0} , so in either case one of them is a multiple of three
[00:03:53] <Ethos> xD
[00:04:06] <average> p doesn't even have to be prime
[00:05:08] <Ethos> I think i am not being clear. I want to prove that, given p prime p > 3, then p^2-1 is always divisible by 24
[00:05:08] <tusko> Ethos is trying to avoid modular arithmetic
[00:05:13] <tusko> it makes them feel weird
[00:05:52] <Ethos> With modular arithmetic is almost trivial. Is not about feeling weird or not. Its about showing this proof to a high school student.

[01:15:05] <Mat1010> A function is a relationship between two sets, Reals and Reals. If from the point of view of the sets the properties of the elements that make up the object do not matter. How can I express that a relationship between is the function that determines by the property of the element that will correspond to it in the set of arrives. What I am trying to
[01:15:05] <Mat1010> say is that the relation or function does take into account the property of the element.
[01:16:10] <Mat1010> or not?
[01:17:04] <somiaj> Well a relationship between two sets is any subset of AxB = { (a,b) : a in A, b in B }
[01:17:37] <Mat1010> That is a Cartesian product
[01:17:45] <somiaj> a relationship is a function if it is well defined, this means that for a subset f subset AxB, f is a function if for all a in A, exists b in B such that (a,b) in f, and if (a,b1) in f and (a,b2) in f, then b1 = b2.
[01:17:49] <somiaj> Correct

[02:40:25] <tomeaton17> How would I go about finding the cumulative distribution function for uniform discrete distribution domain [0,1] but not integer steps? I know the general form is F_x(x) = (x-a+1)/(b-a+1) but this is only for integer

[05:28:28] <isekaijin> Hello. I forget, what was the proof again that the normalization of a not-necessarily-affine variety is well defined?
[05:28:51] <isekaijin> Of course, if our variety is affine, we just embed the coordinate ring into its integral closure.
[05:29:51] <isekaijin> But, given an affine open cover of a variety, how do we guarantee that the local normalizations can be correctly glued?

[07:27:11] <Panther> Our advice is the same as Osler: Read the journals, and the old books.  Leave the new books to the old men. Young people need to learn the old ideas well, and see what’s new, and then they can tell what’s true from what’s false. Remember the old adage: Half of what you will learn is false; you just don’t know which half.

[08:38:57] <Guest145> If f : [a,b] \to R is an increasing function such that a <= f(x) <= b for all x in [a,b]. How many c_i exists with c_i in [a,b] such that f(c_i) = c_i?
[08:39:15] *** Quits: XCode (~XCode@d108-173-59-218.abhsia.telus.net) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[08:39:54] <somiaj> at least one
[08:39:56] <Guest145> I already proved that c = sup(S) where  S = { x in [a,b] : x <= f(x)}, then f(c) = c
[08:40:10] <Guest145> Was wondering the same with c = inf...
[08:40:18] <somiaj> oh wait, your function isn't continous.
[08:40:24] <Guest145> Yeah, no need to be.
[08:40:40] *** Joins: XCode (~XCode@d108-173-59-218.abhsia.telus.net)
[08:41:18] <somiaj> it could also be zero, since you are sending it to R.
[08:41:54] <Guest145> I think if d = inf(S) then we should have f(d) = d but not 100% sure
[08:42:07] <Guest145> since d is a minorant of S..
[08:42:26] <somiaj> so there must be something wrong with your proof if you have proven that f(c) = c holds for any function [a,b] -> R
[08:42:40] <Guest145> increasing function
[08:42:50] <somiaj> let f send x->x+b+2, then there is no c in [a,b] such that f(c) = c
[08:44:16] <somiaj> well I guess I need to be careful, let f: [1,2] -> R be defined by f(x) = x + 3. Then there is no c in [1,2] such that f(c) = c since f(c) >= 4 for all c in [1,2]
[08:44:45] <Guest145> but we also have a <= f(x) <= b
[08:45:01] <Guest145> (for all x)
[08:45:16] <somiaj> grr, sorry, yea I read that then missed it, so best to just say f : [a,b] -> [a,b]....grr
[08:45:45] <somiaj> So in that case, yea at least one.
[08:46:07] <Guest145> Could de inf of M be another one?
[08:46:19] <Guest145> Sorry, S
[08:46:35] <somiaj> You could create an example that only has one point, so not in general.
[08:47:02] <Guest145> Yeah and i found that point to be the sup of the set S
[08:47:18] *** Joins: slidercrank (~slidercra@user/slidercrank)
[08:47:50] <somiaj> [1,2] -> [1,2] given by f(x) = 1/2*x + 1 would be set example, f(2) = 2 is the only fixed point.
[08:48:37] <Guest145> Right. I wonder why its always the sup.
[08:48:52] <somiaj> because of your increasing condition
[08:48:55] <Guest145> Right!
[08:48:59] <Guest145> I am a fool :D

[11:22:31] <f-a> hello, I am trying to grasp the concept of concrete category (so a category w/ a faithful functor to Set). https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3536858 this answer says: «This leads to my favorite example: starting from the graph of the metro in New York (or anywhere you want). The objects are literally metro stations, and the morphisms are metro trips... This is both very natural and as far from sets as I can
[11:22:37] <f-a> imagine»
[11:23:55] <f-a> I am not getting this: if I send every station to a singleton set
[11:24:16] <f-a> and every matro trip to a function between those sets, I think I have a faithful functor?

[11:24:41] <brownorange> Hello I wish to move for a "mistrial" on the subject of provability.
[11:24:56] <brownorange> You might like to hear what I have to say
[11:27:41] <brownorange> "This sentence is false" if assumed true is a direct contradiction. If assumed false would be a contradiction. That's the same behavior of an actual contradiction. Simiarly: "This sentence is not provable" if assumed would be a contradiction because A->A, so it would be a self-contradiction.
[11:27:41] <brownorange> Also: Even if there's compeling mathematical versions of these paradoxes, according to everyone, they shouldn't be decidable else we are being inconsistent. Therefore they can't affect consistency by definition.
[11:29:33] <brownorange> Last but not least you hear often about how they can be true but unprovable because there may be a hypothetical formal system where they are assumed. The issue is that's the same effect of a contradiction.

[16:09:00] <Franciman> injective abelian groups are divisible groups
[16:09:07] <Franciman> while projective abelan groups are free abelian groups

If 0 -> W -> V -> V/W -> 0 is your short exact sequence, then a basis of W can be extended to a basis of V, and the classes of the extra elements modulo W form a basis of V/W. Moreover, you can do it the other way around. Given a basis of V/W, you can take representatives of them in V, and, together with any basis of W, you have a basis of V.

[18:37:13] <isekaijin> If you take a short exact sequence of R-modules 0 -> N -> M -> M/N -> 0 and tensor it with k(p), you get a short exact sequence of k(p)-vector spaces, which splits, even if the original shot exact sequences does not.

[19:24:34] <Franciman> it is not a monoid because if |L| = n
[19:24:40] <Franciman> take a symbol s \in Sigma

[19:25:53] <MaxFury> could you also take a look at my problem and give me a hint on how to solve it?
[19:25:53] <Franciman> but this means it is not a monoid with respect to concatenation

[19:26:51] <Franciman> ah I had read it, but I can't be helpful
[19:26:53] <Franciman> sorry
[19:26:56] <Franciman> i don't know how to solve it
[19:27:14] <andi_> Franciman: so this means that s, s*s are distinct words?
[19:27:23] <Franciman> they are, right?
[19:27:27] <Franciman> a and aa
[19:27:29] <Franciman> are distinct
[19:27:32] <andi_> yes they are
[19:28:06] <Franciman> instead if |L| = 1
[19:28:08] <Franciman> it would be a monoid
[19:28:09] <andi_> ahh Franciman so if |L| = ∞ it's a monoid?
[19:28:20] <Franciman> no it's not yet said
[19:28:24] <Franciman> for example take
[19:28:34] <Franciman> L = { a^n : n \in N } u {b}
[19:28:38] <Franciman> where a^n = a * a ..... * a
[19:28:41] <Franciman> and b is a different symbol
[19:28:43] <Franciman> you still miss
[19:28:46] <Franciman> a*b in your L
[19:29:06] <Franciman> but andi_ again, I want to warn you about this naming
[19:29:15] <Franciman> L is a monoid with respect to what operation?
[19:29:28] <Franciman> I understood it to be concatenation because it is what I usually use. But is it the case for you?
[19:30:05] <andi_> Franciman: yeah, it's concatenation too for me
[19:30:07] <Franciman> to express a monoid you need a set and an operation
[19:30:13] <Franciman> so (L, *) is not a monoid if |L| < inf
[19:30:15] <Franciman> no
[19:30:26] <Franciman> but here again I want to tell something to be more precise, buecaise I feel we need to
[19:30:36] <Franciman> (Sigma*, *) is a monoid
[19:30:40] <Franciman> this is easily proved, right?

[19:46:54] <Franciman> this means that not all of them are in L

[19:50:39] <Z-module> No, there are non-monoid infinite subsets of Sigma*

[20:09:06] <andi_> i just needed a huge push of you and Franciman to come even close to understanding this
[20:09:16] <andi_> probably i need to go back a chapter and repeat the monoids
[20:10:14] <Z-module> word-concatenation monoids are very simple things. They're all automatically associative, and "" is the unique identity element. It's just a qusetion of checking for closure.

[20:11:27] <andi_> so to recap, let L ⊆ Σ* and 2 < |L| < ∞. Then L is not a monoid becaue i can generate n+1 words with concat of x \in L with itself so x, x*x, x*x*x. right?
