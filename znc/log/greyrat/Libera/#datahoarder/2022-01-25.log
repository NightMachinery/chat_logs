[22:01:54] <skye0> also, i think part of the reason people may be opposed to face masks in germany and the netherlands is because compared to english, they seem to have unflattering names
[22:03:12] <skye0> i think i read "mondkapje" and "Mundschutze" on the label of a box for surgical face masks at work, but they're probably mistranslations if i'm not correct

[22:20:33] <joepie91> evilgohan2: I was extremely impressed with that video tbh
[22:20:51] <joepie91> there's one error in it that I've been able to spot, but other than that they clearly understand the topic MUCH better than most critics do
[22:21:08] <joepie91> including catching on to the less obvious factors like the relation between exchange rate and power use
[22:21:26] <skye0> some people tried to justify the existence of NFTs to mitigate the damages caused by copyright infringement but instead because sort of the problem themselves, using art for profit. by legal definitions they are getting away with copyright infringement, but there's already enough people who get copyright infringement notices for something that would technically be under fair use (if it even exists any more) and the current state of
[22:21:26] <skye0> intellectual property law is that companies are obliged to gatekeep and technologically control the information they own for their own monetary benefit
[22:21:59] <skye0> NFTs could have been like Robin Hoods if they kept away from stealing especially marginalized artists' works.
[22:22:04] <joepie91> skye0: the summary of NFTs is "they would be terrible if they didn't work as advertised, and they would also be terrible if they did"
[22:22:18] <joepie91> there is absolutely zero legitimate purpose behind them
[22:22:20] <joepie91> none whatsoever
[22:22:25] <joepie91> the whole thing is 100% a scam and has been from the start
[22:22:40] <joepie91> there is no hypothetical optimal case where they do something good for society, never has been
[22:22:49] <joepie91> not even on paper
[22:22:58] <skye0> i still wish there was some way to destroy this broken copyright law that only benefits those who are privileged from the start and basically does what NFTs do
[22:23:14] <skye0> use art and science purely for profit
[22:23:23] <skye0> the UK pirate party disbanded so that sucks

[22:24:38] <skye0> just realized i bought this full price, but i didn't like the retro rainbow/psychedelic design anyway
[22:25:08] <evilgohan2> joepie91: I was very impressed with how they tied it all back to the 2008 Financial Crash, and the practices that led up to it, and how this is almost a complete rehash -  except that it has far exceeded the risky behaviors encouraged then.
[22:25:36] <evilgohan2> That video is long, but I watched all 2 hours of it, and it was absolutely worth it
[22:26:31] <skye0> the whole crypto movement seems to have come from ancaps, who saw governments and centralized banks to be the problem. they only saw just the lehman brothers to be the problem i think
[22:26:39] <joepie91> skye0: I don't think NFTs do what you think they do
[22:27:02] <skye0> i'm struggling to make the most of my spare time outside of work and i kind of want to change my job soon, even though i've only been in permanent work for like a month
[22:27:04] <joepie91> evilgohan2: yep, same
[22:28:14] <joepie91> skye0: but yeah, the thing with NFTs is that there's this widespread belief that "NFTs can be used to track ownership of things and help artists, they're just being used wrong", but that's 100% bullshit, NFTs do literally none of those things, even the "tracking ownership" is an outright lie
[22:28:32] <joepie91> it's not salvageable, there was never any legitimate tech there, and the people who started out shilling it know that
[22:28:34] <evilgohan2> skye0: you honestly need to watch that video.
[22:30:02] <skye0> evilgohan2 after i get some more booze (even though i'm on meds), i'm not in the mood to have something else to get angry about just by being reminded about the existence of shitty copyright law or whatever NFT claimed to solve, the pandemic denialism is already getting to me.
[22:31:17] <joepie91> well, you "need" to watch that video if you want to understand why NFTs are 100% unreservedly bunk. but if you're happy to accept that on face value, there's no need to watch it :p
