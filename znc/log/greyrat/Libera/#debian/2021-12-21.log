[04:31:38] <velix> but since gpg is needed anyway... I hope I can find a slim one ;)
[04:31:47] <kveroneau> More 3rd party repos need to provide the key that format to make it easier to use the key with having gpg installed.
[04:32:05] <velix> kveroneau: or step away from the huge monster gpg.
[04:32:28] <velix> and use more modern stuff, like "age"

[04:32:41] <kveroneau> age?
[04:33:03] <velix> oops age is for encryption, sorry ;)

[16:06:38] <cadmio> what's the best graphic card for debian in order not to have to install propertaty firmwares?
[16:06:57] <randall> cadmio: intel, or amd.
[16:07:10] <ln> by 'propertaty' you might mean 'proprietary'
[16:07:30] <maxzor> I installed debian one week ago, and for a recent amd card you'll get greeted with a tty while you install the bin blob for your gpu
[16:07:59] <randall> Intel will pretty much work out of the box, except for GMA500 chipsets, which aren't put into current machines. Next up is AMD, but I'm not sure how well all GPUs are covered there.

[21:19:19] <rendar> when Debian installer asked me "allow login as root?" inadvertently i clicked yes but now i want to revert that option, how can i do this?
[21:21:24] *** Quits: thlnz (~thln@user/thlnz) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[21:23:13] <somiaj> rendar: passwd has a '-l, --lock' option you can use. You can make the shell /sbin/nologin, note this won't keep root from loging in via say an ssh key
[21:23:42] <somiaj> but I think the passwd -l is what the installer does
[21:23:45] <rendar> somiaj, i see, so the Debian installer will only modify that thing, e.g. the shell into /etc/passwd
[21:23:58] *** Joins: lunc (lunc@user/lunc)
[21:24:33] <somiaj> yes, all this does is change /etc/passwd to lock the root account, I think the -l puts a character in front of the password hash in /etc/shadow making the password always fail, changing the shell is something else
[21:24:40] <rendar> but are you sure? i'm in a system where root login are disabled by /etc/password clearly shows /bin/bash as root login
[21:24:44] <somiaj> because you may want to keep the shell there for say 'su -'
