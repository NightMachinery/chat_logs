[00:08:05] <ggb> Clojure isn't a scheme for the same reason it's not a Common Lisp. Rich was scratching his own itch for a new Lisp on a hosted runtime (Java and CLR).
[00:08:49] <ggb> It's the same answer for any value of *LISP-NAME* you might choose.
[00:08:54] <tatsumaru> Isn't the difference between Lisp and Common Lisp just standartization?

[00:09:57] <ggb> Lisp is a language family. If you want to say one thing is Lisp, the only good argument, imho, is McCarthy's original Lisp. Everything else is a remix.
[00:10:32] <tatsumaru> I think of Lisp as McCarthy's original lisp and everything else as Lisp dialects.
[00:10:59] <ggb> Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure are the three biggest names I know of in the family.
[00:11:57] <v3ga> clojure is a lisp for the *BETTER GOOD* =)

[00:19:02] <yauhsien> McCarthy's one uses only three symbols as delimiters, and it forms the essential.
[00:19:05] <ggb> If you want to get a feel for why Clojure is what it is, Rich Hickey has given lots of presentations (all of which I consider valuable). A few that are probably good for contextualizing his choices are: Effective Programs - 10 Years of Clojure; Clojure for Java Programmers; Clojure for Lisp Programmers; A History of Clojure; and Clojure Data Structures.
[00:19:31] <ggb> Several of those are two parts.
[00:20:02] <tatsumaru> I tried watching Clojure TV but it was a bit advanced for me, I will try it again later when I have more Clojure experience under my belt. This is my first programming language.
[00:20:51] <ggb> Ah, that might make some of the context difficult. Clojure can be considered, in many regards, a reaction to C-style programming languages.
[00:21:54] <ggb> Rich even says as much in several of those talks I mentioned. Specifically he was fed up with designing large systems in C++, Java, and C#.
[00:23:46] <ggb> It may be tough to bootstrap an understanding of very different languages when your perspective on programming is being shaped by Clojure, which is both different and also better in a lot of ways than those. It's a good problem to have, though (:
[00:25:33] <tatsumaru> I picked up a C programming book when I was 12 I think, I remember I was really happy when I wrote a moon phase calculator or something like that. But then I dropped programming due to laziness. I also know a little bit JS, but I hate it so much that I find it hard to study it. Clojure is the first programming language which feels human friendly to me so it's the only one that I stuck with.
[00:27:30] <v3ga> tatsumaru: same... well qbasic, visualbasic(AOL kickers/punters were all the rave), a little c++ then I stopped.  I did html/css and years later gave ruby a stab but it didn't hold.

[00:33:50] <yauhsien> I wonder how is my feeling if my first programming language was Lisp but C++.
[00:34:40] <v3ga> i'm convinced it's a personality type... i even noticed, especially in common lisp the way people name their projects is similar to what I'd want to do.  they name projects like one would a novel/book title opposed to a singular noun
[00:34:45] <tatsumaru> Well who knows, I think whether you like it or not might not have to do too much with your previous history. Some people start with C and love it some start with C and hate it.
[00:35:26] <v3ga> things that i found odd about myself or way of thinking seem to be right at home in the lisp world.  I think we're prone to like abstractions... o_O;

[01:19:17] <ggb> i3 here.
[01:23:01] <tatsumaru> do these setups only have value if you are doing multiple thing at the same time? why do you need multiple windows visible at the same time?
[01:24:00] <technomancy> guess it depends what you're comparing it to
[01:24:57] <tatsumaru> well I am using gnome at the moment
[01:25:31] <technomancy> most conventional setups really suck at letting you configure them using dotfiles so you can have a history of changes and consistency across machines
[01:25:32] <yauhsien> in my case it's against lack of my short-term memory. I just use emacs splitting windows.
[01:25:34] <zephyr> the more windows you can see without typing anything, the less you need to type just to see things... handy for reference material, monitoring communications etc
[01:25:49] <technomancy> I think gnome is pretty bad at that, so using a WM that has a proper config file is a big win in that regard.
[01:26:29] <technomancy> IIRC gnome also makes you switch all your displays at the same time when you change workspaces which is suuuuuper annoying not to be able to change them independently
[01:26:30] <v3ga> I used xmonad for around 2 years...
[01:26:53] <ggb> I will often use fullscreen or two windows alongside one another, either 67/33 or 50/50 split.
[01:27:12] <tatsumaru> ggb: what's the value of i3 for you
[01:27:35] <zephyr> tatsumaru do you use the tabs of your browser?
[01:27:54] <v3ga> when I get my next laptop i'll most likely go back to a tilining manager. it just makes keeping things exactly where you want them easier. there's no space not used unless you don't want it to be. 
[01:28:05] <technomancy> my WM lets me use the same commands I use to change editor buffers and screen splits for non-editor windows too, and it's the best thing I've ever used
[01:28:13] <tatsumaru> zephyr I try to use as little as possible to maintain focus, so when I have multiple tabs open I consider it to be a sign of poor task management on my side
[01:28:19] <ggb> Easy to do keyboard only nav that doesn't include M-tab-ing through many windows. Easy configuration. No stupid keybinds from my window manager.
[01:28:20] <technomancy> not having to keep two separate sets of key bindings in my head is such a relief
[01:29:03] <v3ga> i'm actually interested in penrose...a WM made with rust.  When/if I don't suck at rust I may give that a whirl and try to jump in helping with it.
[01:29:17] <tatsumaru> technomancy: why two sets?
[01:29:29] <zephyr> tatsumaru oic. in i3 land basically anything can be a tab, and tabs can have tabs, etc (among other layouts). as others suggest, a win is you need to know fewer keys overall to navigate around, but that may not be helpful/interesting if you consider having lots of things open bad
[01:29:36] <ggb> I could chase down a whole bunch of config in another DE and figure out how it stores its config. Or I can have one brief config in my dotfiles that only has a few keychords bound.
[01:29:49] <technomancy> tatsumaru: well like previously I would have to think about emacs key bindings and gnome or emacs and xmonad. now I just use emacs commands for everything.
[01:31:14] <tatsumaru> technomancy: how do you use the same bindings for both don't they overlap?
[01:31:17] <ggb> I also use multiple browser windows frequently for work (different profile per window), and those get stacked on a single workspace. So I can get to my browser with Super+1, and then step through my work browsers with Super+j/k. Browser is always one chord away. Same for anything else.
[01:31:47] <technomancy> tatsumaru: there's no overlap because emacs is the window manager
[01:32:28] <tatsumaru> technomancy do you use emacs as an OS?
[01:32:47] <technomancy> well... that's a complicated question with a complicated answer

[01:44:26] <technomancy> the only downside of keyboardio is they have a bad TLD
[01:45:02] <TimMc> What's the argument for staggering? Wrist alignment?
[01:45:19] <technomancy> TimMc: vertical stagger or horizontal stagger?
[01:45:55] <technomancy> the argument for horizontal stagger is "it's the 1800s and we need room for typewriter mechanisms"
[01:46:13] <technomancy> the argument for vertical stagger is "just look at your hand, man. that's how it's shaped"
[01:47:06] <ggb> Horizontal stagger refers to the non-orthlinear layout, correct?
[01:47:28] <tatsumaru> I remember back in the late 70s some IBM scientists discovered some phenomenon which they named after him, it was called the Doherty threshold. basically he found out that when output takes longer than a certain length of time computers are painful to use but, more interestingly when output reaches a sudden speed suddenly computers become fun and addictive to use
[01:47:33] <technomancy> ggb: stagger and ortholinear are opposites
[01:47:44] <tatsumaru> sorry for the typos
[01:48:03] <technomancy> ggb: horizontal stagger is what you see on typewriters; vertical stagger is what you see on keyboards designed to fit how hands work

[01:48:29] <ggb> Is the Kinesis an example of vertical stagger?
[01:49:02] <technomancy> kinesis advantage is kind of unique; it puts the keys in a bowl so it doesn't need any stagger
[01:49:22] <tatsumaru> technomancy can you play games on those ergonomic keyboards?
[01:49:32] <technomancy> because it's 3D; kind of like how a globe doesn't need to pick between map projections.
[01:49:35] <technomancy> tatsumaru: sure
[01:49:40] <ggb> Do you have a reference keyboard for vertical stagger?
[01:49:50] <technomancy> ggb: atreus is one; keyboardio is another
[01:50:28] <ggb> Ah, gotcha!.
[01:50:54] <ggb> I was having trouble visualizing what it meant, but was just thinking about it wrong. I knew I was thinking incorrectly, but couldn't get myself past it.
[01:50:55] <ggb> Thanks!
[01:51:30] <tatsumaru> keyboardio linear a is quite pretty

[01:54:18] <tatsumaru> technomancy: which ergo keyboard do you recommend for someone who has never used ergo keyboard
[01:55:03] <tatsumaru> I really like how the advantage 2 looks
[01:55:06] <technomancy> keyboardio has an easier learning curve than the atreus so if people get intimidated by the idea of using layers that's my recommendation
[01:55:21] <technomancy> but it's really just having a second shift key so it shouldn't be that intimidating
[01:55:58] <technomancy> just don't bother with an ergo keyboard that doesn't fix the stagger
[01:56:13] <tatsumaru> what was the stagger again sorry
[01:57:29] <ggb> The Kinesis definitely has a learning curve. Just FYI that you won't be at 100% in week1. I don't consider the curve too steep or too long, but it's there. Some friends had seemingly much more trouble than I did, when they used mine.
[01:58:02] <technomancy> tatsumaru: don't use one that looks like a typewriter
[01:58:05] <technomancy> it's not the 1800s
[01:58:29] <tatsumaru> ggb: do you use the advantage2?
[01:58:34] <ggb> Yes.

[02:04:30] <ggb> I'm using it right now.
[02:04:59] <ggb> I primarily make typos when moving from this to a laptop, and only then for the keys that are in different positions.
[02:05:49] <ggb> E.g., +/= is on the left side of the number row. The square/curly brackets are below the , and / keys. `/~ is below z.
[02:06:58] <tatsumaru> ah yes what about typing lots of brackets?
[02:09:04] * form_feed whispers "programmer dvorak" in tatsumaru's ear and fades into the night.
[02:09:07] <ggb> It's not hard to. It's just that I transition frequently and having two layouts in muscle memory leads to misfires sometimes.
[02:09:30] <tatsumaru> ggb which layouts do you use
[02:10:17] <ggb> Kinesis's standard qwerty (which includes those alternate positions I mentioned).
[02:10:33] <ggb> I remap some of the thumb cluster to personal preference, and the caps lock is remapped to CTRL.

[15:55:15] <yeik-the-spik[m]> https://iloveponies.github.io/120-hour-epic-sax-marathon/index.html
[15:56:56] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I have what I guess is a JVM question. I have a library and an app that uses said library.  A function on my library goes like this:

[15:59:04] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Now, that code runs fine within the lib's project repl. It's also used in tests
[15:59:27] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I deploy the library to my local mave using lein
[15:59:44] <yeik-the-spik[m]> lein pom
[15:59:44] <yeik-the-spik[m]> lein jar
[15:59:44] <yeik-the-spik[m]> lein install
[16:00:53] <yeik-the-spik[m]> But when I require the lib in the app, variant-list and symbol-list are empty
[16:02:49] <yeik-the-spik[m]> running the code yields the following error

[16:06:06] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Am I guessing on the right direction?
[16:07:10] <yeik-the-spik[m]> If so, its likely that I could solve the issue modifying the java code that gets called. It reads from url, but my guess is it could read from a file with relative path no issue.

[16:25:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> makes a lot of sense
[16:26:03] <yeik-the-spik[m]> thanks a lot for your answer!
[16:26:11] <sobel> that reminds me, watch out for jars that have hardcoded resource path URIs, aka the dreaded static initializer error
[16:26:36] <sobel> jars that have classes that have hardcoded resource path URIs
[16:27:57] <ridcully_> so they expect from you to keep the file with the same name they decided?  omg...
[16:29:57] <yeik-the-spik[m]> It's more likely they do not know better. 
[16:30:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> yours truly being clear evidence of the ignorance out there xP
[16:31:45] <sobel> ridcully_: worse, you can't even repack that jar, lest the path change
[16:32:03] <ridcully_> don't sweat over that.  this is a problem production builds stumbled over since the dawn of java
[16:32:26] <sobel> and don't use crusty old jakarta jars. that was my mistake.
[16:32:34] <sobel> that legacy crap is dead and should stay buried
[16:32:49] <ridcully_> you will not find many folks, that did not learn about resource the hard way
[16:33:07] * sobel raises a hand
[16:34:04] <sobel> i'm about to finish code today that uses FileSystem to walk regular and jar directories. i'll have my URI usage nailed down after this :)

[22:30:13] <tatsumaru> hey guys do you think clojure is on the decline?
[22:42:29] <jeaye> tatsumaru: Hard to measure, but the SO survey is one option. It shows Clojure growing in popularity.
[22:42:54] <jeaye> 2019 survey shows Clojure at 1.4% for "most popular": https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019
[22:43:07] <jeaye> 2021 survey shows Clojure at 1.88% for "most popular": https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021
[22:43:26] <tatsumaru> there's a decline in google searches for clojure which some people consider indicative
[22:43:51] <jeaye> Also, Clojure devs remain the highest paid devs by any language.
[22:44:08] <tatsumaru> is this really true?
[22:44:25] <technomancy> must be because of clojure developers moving to duckduckgo
[22:44:28] <technomancy> =)
[22:44:47] <jeaye> It's covered in the two links I shared, tatsumaru.
[22:44:54] <technomancy> it's like how fennel is hardly used on github at all because github sucks at syntax highlighting for fennel so everyone uses different platforms

[23:03:35] * manicennui isn't interested in working with languages just because they are popular.
[23:04:22] <technomancy> getting paid is nice tho
[23:09:16] <jeaye> Clearly most of us aren't, considering Clojure's popularity rating is < 2%
[23:09:18] <jeaye> :D
[23:09:46] <jeaye> But 2019 did show Clojure as the 68.3% most loved.
[23:12:25] <technomancy> yeah the lower bound on popularity for getting paid is way below 2%
[23:12:31] <technomancy> but it exists
[23:21:20] <jeaye> technomancy: My response was for manicennui, not you.
[23:21:37] <jeaye> i.e. most of us aren't using langs just 'cause they're popular.
[23:21:49] * technomancy nods
[23:21:54] <manicennui> Sure.
[23:22:13] <manicennui> I do see a large number of software developers who are obsessed with the popularity of their tools.
[23:22:24] <jeaye> manicennui: The majority of devs are, I'd say.
[23:22:39] <jeaye> Clojure devs are so very far from the majority.
[23:23:01] <TimMc> I suppose that popularity might correlate with continued support.
[23:23:06] <jeaye> My team's latest hire asked over and over "But why would you use Clojure when you know it's not popular?" Literally, those words.
[23:23:34] <technomancy> lol
[23:24:29] <TimMc> (readily available tooling, ease of hiring, size of community when needing help, etc.)
[23:24:33] <jeaye> "Because we have a ton of data to transform and doing that in TypeScript would be a nightmare." didn't seem to make my point clearly enough.
[23:24:39] <jeaye> TimMc: This is true.
[23:24:49] <TimMc> (number of snippets available on Stack Overflow)
[23:24:57] <tatsumaru>  It's official I am ditching clojure for cobol
[23:25:15] <TimMc> godspeed and please blog about it
[23:25:20] <manicennui> I don't use SO for snippets.
[23:25:34] <tatsumaru> I am also going to write a cobol lisp, it's going to be the next clojure
[23:25:36] <jeaye> Implement cobol in Clojure macros?
[23:25:38] <TimMc> manicennui: Neither do I, but some people do.
[23:25:42] <technomancy> I think most people can't imagine a language that's simple enough that you don't need a massive army of devs writing tooling
[23:26:00] <ggb> tatsumaru: https://github.com/azac/cobol-on-wheelchair
[23:26:01] <Para> It's an antithesis of all growth hype.
[23:26:25] <manicennui> Look at the obsession over whether some random library has been updated recently.
[23:26:26] <tatsumaru> ggb this is too funny
[23:26:30] <manicennui> As if frequent changes are good.
[23:26:35] <TimMc> ggb: omg
[23:26:45] <Para> Like Peloton just announced they're going to fire 2800 people. A freakin' IoT exercise bike company.
[23:26:47] <jeaye> manicennui: Yeah, that's a big one. Especially in the Clojure community.
[23:26:50] <manicennui> Nothing can ever be done.
[23:26:57] <jeaye> Para :|
[23:26:59] <manicennui> Gotta add features (and bugs).
[23:26:59] <TimMc> tatsumaru: Why not make the next COBOL in Clojure instead? :-)
[23:27:53] <tatsumaru> TimMc because I am afraid it will be too good and will destroy the clojure community
[23:28:05] <Para> Why would I ever want to do cobol?
[23:28:13] <logiz> ah yes, the one thing that fractures the clojure community is cobol
[23:28:14] <manicennui> Para: Money.
[23:28:18] <tatsumaru> Don't you mean Coboljure
[23:28:48] <Para> manicennui: Clojure already pays me enough + it's actually pretty fun to do.
[23:29:08] <manicennui> Para: To control the world's banking?
[23:29:27] <Para> Oh I've done consulting for a bank. I'd rather stay irrelevant to them.
[23:29:28] <ggb> The challenge with stable things is that it's difficult to tell them from abandoned, incomplete things, without either a pretty thorough investigation or a trusted oracle.
[23:29:47] <technomancy> good thing we have IRC
[23:29:51] <tatsumaru> Para: you have strayed from the path of meaningless greed, it's still not too late to transition to Coboljure - a modern way to deal with redundant infrastructure
[23:29:53] <ggb> Activity is a proxy (no statement as to its quality) for whether you can expect support.
[23:29:54] <technomancy> excellent source of trusted oracles
[23:30:55] <TimMc> COBOL : banks :: CLOBOL : ???
[23:30:55] <manicennui> I think the biggest need for change in Clojure libraries is changes in dependencies. 
[23:31:19] <ggb> TimMc: ??? == blanks
[23:31:28] <Para> technomancy: There's a bar in Helsinki which seems to attract both the most hard core socialists and old mainframe programmers. It's _very_ trashy place.
[23:31:49] <tatsumaru> sounds like something from 'halt and catch fire'
[23:31:53] <TimMc> ggb: >_<
[23:32:10] <ggb> You literally asked for it.
[23:32:21] <Para> Beer is cheap, the bartender doesn't speak any language I know, usually within 15 minutes you'll be offered sirloin for cheap by shoplifters...
[23:32:29] <TimMc> That was an entirely unintentional but nevertheless excellent pun.
[23:32:56] <ggb> Best kind. Intended puns can't help but be at least a little smug.
[23:33:03] <tatsumaru> Para: maybe the bartender speaks fortran?

Do you think it would be better to 1: make the function perform the side effect and return a new state value, wrapping the whole function call with (swap!) or 2: make the function call swap! with the new state value and return the string to be sent as IO?
