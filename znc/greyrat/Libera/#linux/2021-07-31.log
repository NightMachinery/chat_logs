[00:50:15] <ayecee> then not that.

[00:50:58] <ayecee> fakuve: which part do you figure is the destination address
[00:51:00] <Dagmar> For firewalld it would basically be `firewall-cmd --zone=localnetwork --permanent --add-service=samba` and another prior command to define hosts in that netblock as being in zone localnetwork

[02:40:06] <Linkandzelda> im sad, i think i have to move away from bitlbee due to recent changes in the discord API. anyknow know of a good CLI client for discord if it exists?
[02:41:17] <ivanhoe> Linkandzelda: You can use Finch with purple-discord plugin. I find it usable.
[02:41:46] <Linkandzelda> ivanhoe: what about the new Threads thing, and the Replies feature?
[02:42:24] <hi^-^> Ugh, pidgin and finch are such a headache
[02:42:58] <ivanhoe> Linkandzelda: definitely no Threads, not sure about Replies

[02:43:23] <hi^-^> also, doesn't it just work like bitlbee?
[02:43:43] <Linkandzelda> ivanhoe: threads are the deal breaker, now people created threads and i have no idea anyone added me and no way to see/write in threads
[02:43:52] <Linkandzelda> and with Replies, context is impossible

[02:50:02] <akik> *matrix* comes around copying half the previous message to confuse the h out of that
[02:50:11] <phogg> Linkandzelda: if you want the protocol to be aware of *replies* you have enormously complicated the data model, and if you want to interleave messages with and without replies in the same stream you're going to have a bad time

[02:50:52] <phogg> threading is even worse
[02:51:01] <phogg> I'm not saying there aren't things you can do to make it look like it works, it's just a bad idea that isn't ever going to work.
[02:51:28] <phogg> square peg, round hole. You can hammer them together, but it's not nice.
[02:51:37] <Linkandzelda> threads is even easier to fix, they are just sub-channels
[02:51:59] <Psi-Jack> heh, well, THAT makes sense. I wasn't running the snapper-timeline.timer or snapper-cleanup.timer timers, so my snapper snapshots weren't getting cleaned up.
[02:52:01] <phogg> threads are not easy
[02:52:27] <Linkandzelda> phogg: are we talking about discord's Threads or a different type of thread?
[02:52:41] <Linkandzelda> e.g. twitter
[02:52:42] <phogg> Linkandzelda: threading in general, I haven't looked at discord's specifically

[02:53:41] <Linkandzelda> phogg: discord's idea of Threads is someone can create a thread off of any message, and then add a bunch of other people/anyone can be included in the thread. but the thread is an entirely separate chat that just appears as a dropdown under the name of the channel

[02:54:58] <Psi-Jack> I know, right?!?
[02:55:13] <Linkandzelda> phogg: i mean, whats wrong with a new channel for that thread with the topic being the original message/name of the thread?
[02:56:06] <phogg> Linkandzelda: a channel is still flat, threads are not flat. Users have to join channels to see threads, so they're not getting them in context

[02:56:56] <phogg> Linkandzelda: in discord a person could just as easily add a new message to the channel after the threaded message, which would not appear to the threaded conversation (and the threaded conversation would not appear on IRC in the original channel) leading to much confusion
[02:57:03] <phogg> like I said, it's presentation-time trickery
[02:57:04] <Linkandzelda> phogg: im probably missing something, but i dont see it. the discord threads once created are flat, no?
[02:57:16] <phogg> if their threads are flat they're not threads
[02:58:02] <Linkandzelda> phogg: i dont think they are threads at all honestly. they seem entirely flat/single-level

[06:04:12] <Henry151> on my server i've got a glances-->influxdb-->grafana thing set up to monitor stuff
[06:04:25] <Henry151> it keeps overflowing my /var/lib/influxdb/data folder
[06:04:33] <Henry151> how do i tell it to rotate or whatever?

[10:42:51] <jeffreybenzos[m]> On my system with ALSA already installed, both firefox and chromium are having a hard time with some applications. I figure that I can fix this by just installing pipewire and configuring it to also catch pulseaudio stuff without pulse being installed. How does an application even ask for and get provided a situation with pipewire?

[14:09:16] <anon16_> Hi, just wondering, when looking at the memory used by a certain process in htop, does that include all of its child processes as well, or do they count seperately? So if I have a process that uses x bytes of memory, and htop reports that it has several child processes that are also using x (the exact amount of the parent process), is the memory usage in this case just a single "x", or is it x multiplied by the amount of (child) processes?

[14:31:18] <mlu> I like to manually author my own boot media
[14:31:25] <TJ-> ankins: the idea is you write this boot-sector using dd to sector 0 of a USB or other device, boot the system, and see what it reports
[14:31:31] <mlu> UEFI makes it easy: it's literally just files on an ESP
[14:31:45] <mlu> and an ESP is just a FAT32 partition that's marked as such on the GPT
[14:32:03] <TJ-> mlu: doesn't have to be FAT32, can be FAT12/16
[14:32:24] <jochum> TJ-: it sounds very complicated, don't you think its better to startup that installer in live mode again and try to debug it?
[14:32:26] <mlu> better question is how you get it to fit on a FAT16 :P
[14:32:32] <TJ-> I generally use FAT12 since it's always very small and dosn't need 32 bits per cluster

[14:34:02] <mlu> used to be under 4GB, but ever since that got exceeded, you cross your fingers and hope that system supports UEFI boot on NTFS

[14:37:32] <ankins> on a sidenote, i feel really inadequate atm. though there is another possibility i dont know how feasable it is to do but the system has two harddrives that would both be possible to boot from. One of it has the windows 7 install on it which i am typing in right now
[14:37:44] <mlu> akik: I looked at the MS-generated ones and they only have NTFS, so what I do is mark the partition as ESP, format it as NTFS, and then copy the ISO contents as-is
[14:38:20] <mlu> and yeah, that's not a standard-compliant boot drive, but then again, you probably don't want to install Windows on a system that wasn't forced by MS to support boot from NTFS

[22:29:24] <bin> cool ty for your help so far :)
[22:29:55] <PaulFertser> bin: installing a UEFI bootloader is a simple process: the efi file is coped to system partition. Then an NVRAM modification call is made to add the path to the efi bootloader to the UEFI variables that control boot on this machine. UEFI variables are usually stored in part of a flash IC on the motherboard.

[22:31:01] <PaulFertser> bin: you see no grub there so it likely means it wasn't installed. Alternatively, it might mean that this UEFI implementation is buggy and somehow erases the NVRAM modifications. Let's see if you can make it work. Do you know how to chroot to the system you installed?
