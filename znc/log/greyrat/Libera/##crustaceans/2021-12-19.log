[00:00:07] <imode> if it's a universal trait I should be pissed off that edm doesn't think like I do.
[00:00:49] <imode> but.. I'm not, funny how that is.
[00:01:45] <edm>  we’ve got to the point where climate change isn’t a problem because god will save is is == elon will save us in north america
[00:01:54] <edm> ludicrous fantascists
[00:02:20] <edm> i appeal to Xe to come and ban me if this is all stupid and I’m being rude
[00:03:10] <riv> tbh you are the only one bringin up elon musk again and again
[00:03:17] <riv> i think we all pretty much detest him
[00:03:33] <riv> so there is some common ground at least?
[00:03:59] <manicennui> Everyone is just being silly
[00:04:03] <manicennui> No one needs to be banned
[00:04:23] <imode> if beating a straw man was a bannable offense I'm pretty sure this channel would be empty.
[00:04:52] <Brekkjern> We can make that wish come true...
[00:05:26] <edm> right so i will be charitable too. there is nothing in the next 100 million years where abandoning earth is the easiet solution
[00:05:36] <Xe> edm: youre not completely wrong but youre not completely right either
[00:06:11] <Xe> gaia will survive with or without us
[00:06:20] <manicennui> edm: What if the problem is that I hate Earthlings?
[00:06:22] <imode> not if the sun expands to engulf us. :P
[00:06:37] <imode> and you're correct, edm! that's why I want terraforming first.
[00:06:50] <imode> can't do shit on a planet if you can't make it into a habitat you can survive in.
[00:06:52] <riv> imode: do you ever listen to isaac arthur asimov?
[00:06:58] <imode> read a couple stories.
[00:07:02] <riv> sorry err
[00:07:10] <riv> not the scifi author, its a podcast
[00:07:16] <imode> oh, lmao.
[00:07:20] <imode> that is an unfortunate naming collision.
[00:07:24] <riv> yeah
[00:07:26] <riv> it goes into detail on stuff like terraforming
[00:07:29] <edm> and in my opinion [feel free to disgree] 100 million years is good good horizon for ‘wildly beyond our current technological capability’ but within what we understand of the solar system and our threats
[00:07:31] <riv> let me find it
[00:07:45] <imode> I hope you're right, edm.

[00:08:11] <riv> i havent listened to it in ages, but there's cool stuff there
[00:08:15] <edm> Xe: i’m specifically talking about ‘us’ as humans
[00:08:29] <Xe> https://christine.website/blog/untitled-2019-06-20
[00:08:40] <imode> there's a blog post for everything.
[00:09:00] <edm> something between single-celled organisms and us likely has a good shot
[00:09:31] <edm> bust mostly between 100 million years is negligible on solar-system timescales
[00:09:41] <edm> because*
[00:09:43] <manicennui> Idea: let's try to live better lives now, where "better" doesn't mean "more convenient access to distractions".
[00:10:01] <imode> someone's gotta be steering the ship towards "later".
[00:10:06] <riv> i like that idea
[00:10:13] <riv> it's all we have got
[00:10:26] <manicennui> imode: Someone is. They are steering it toward what benefits them though.
[00:10:38] <imode> yeh.
[00:10:41] <manicennui> And not even in a way that truly makes their life better.
[00:10:52] <imode> monayyyyy.
[00:10:53] <edm> but i object tho this view also
[00:11:31] <edm> there's a slightly facile observation that i really don't think is true, that i can characterise as 'well it's all just pointless because capitalism'
[00:11:41] <manicennui> No one said that.
[00:12:07] <edm> you/we can refuse to work for amazon/facebook/whomever now despite there not being a Glorious Revolution
[00:13:00] <imode> and miss out on all the money?
[00:13:12] <imode> (should probably clarify with /s)
[00:13:22] <manicennui> I don't think a small percentage of us (software engineers) refusing to work for them has any real impact, but you should also do what makes sense for you.
[00:13:31] <manicennui> I refuse to work for them for different reasons.
[00:13:44] <edm> don't worry /s inferred
[00:13:51] <manicennui> I work for a lender. It's not as though my employer is great for humanity.
[00:14:32] <edm> like not buying from nestlé in the other channel we're both on, it's hard but when you know you can change your behaviour
[00:15:02] <Xe> i try to do well by my philosophical views on the nature of this reality and heres hoping the next life isnt one of judgement and/or torment
[00:15:19] <edm> and i don't think it's too silly or defeatist to lament the amount of intellectual capital spent of bullship companies in our world
[00:15:56] <manicennui> I don't buy from Nestle mostly because their products sucks
[00:16:01] <manicennui> suck
[00:16:27] <edm> right but there are also moral reasons that don't depend on whether or not you like the taste of palm oil
[00:16:58] <edm> and those are important too
[00:18:17] <manicennui> To you, sure.
[00:20:13] <edm> the only thing that can support your statement is that you think morality is entirely relativistic
[00:22:53] <gwozniak> wow... missed out on a lot here
[00:22:59] <manicennui> edm: It is.
[00:23:07] <manicennui> How could it be otherwise?
[00:23:17] <manicennui> What is the source of morality?
[00:23:39] <manicennui> There is only what we each believe, and what we agree to abide by as a group.
[00:23:42] <edm> god or game theory more or less covers the last 2000 years of though on the subject
[00:23:51] <edm> thought*
[00:24:02] <manicennui> Game theory isn't a theory of morality.
[00:24:31] <manicennui> And God is just a way for humans to try to make their own beliefs seem less questionable.
[00:25:25] <edm> well i mean write up your theory that what humans call morality doesn't come from game theory
[00:25:56] <manicennui> By source I mean something like God.
[00:26:08] <edm> there's a nobel prize in philosophy waiting for you and you need never spend another day pasting reddit links into #crustaceans again
[00:26:15] <manicennui> I don't mean explain how we come up with them.
[00:27:33] <manicennui> Without deities and other nonsense, it usually boils down to people confusing IS and SHOULD.
[00:28:00] <manicennui> Or they agree on some base axioms but don't see how those axioms are relative.
[00:29:05] <manicennui> At best you can say that we are all animals who want to continue living, and things that prevent that are less desirable.
[00:30:46] <manicennui> You can claim that killing other people is wrong, but you can also think of a number of cases where it is justified.
[00:30:55] <manicennui> And now we are just debating what those exceptions are.
[00:31:37] <manicennui> And you can say, "Well, this society allows killing in this case, which leads to this."
[00:31:48] <manicennui> And now we are debating whether the thing it leads to is good or bad.
[00:32:00] <dcz_> if you confuse game theory and morality, you may end up thinking the tragedy of the commons is a moral value
[00:32:20] <manicennui> You can't prove that being alive is objectively moral.
[00:32:36] <manicennui> Which is where God comes in
[00:33:25] <dcz_> there are people who claim that there is a moral truth and it doesn't depend on deities... but I haven't dug into that
[00:35:35] <manicennui> Sure.
[00:35:42] <imode> on another note.
[00:35:46] <imode> y'all ever play A Dark Room.
[00:35:55] <manicennui> Most of those people are confused by IS versus SHOULD, or they confuse "commonly held belief" with "objective truth".
[00:36:25] <riv> yes I did play that!
[00:36:29] <dcz_> those are not the interesting ones though
[00:36:51] <imode> I feel like that game could be extended into a full-fledged sandbox without end.
[00:37:44] <riv> i was playing Universal Paperclips
[00:37:59] <riv> but the game mechanics got too complicated and I lost track of what to do

[00:40:27] <riv> great
[00:40:42] <imode> it can also work on piddly little machines.

[00:42:20] <manicennui> I got stuck far into Universal Paperclips because I couldn't produce enough of something to deal with the aliens or whatever.
[00:42:45] <manicennui> It was just an endless cycle of my building things up and reducing their numbers then running out of resources and their numbers increasing again.
[00:42:56] <riv> the quantum part and the trading simulation stuff is making no sense to me
[00:43:01] <riv> and i dont really feel like experimenting to figure it out
[00:43:06] <riv> that's where i kind of trailed off
[00:43:20] <riv> that is the game loop of all of these ithink
[00:44:44] <imode> I dreamt last night of an interesting text-based "demake" of Vintage Story.
[00:45:16] <riv> someone was asking about goal driver npc ai
[00:45:25] <riv> that figures out plans and stuff from dialogue
[00:45:31] <riv> could potentially go with that
[00:46:16] <imode> had the traditional north/south/east/west/up/down navigation, you moved from "block" to "block", and on each block you could gather resources at that block, place down structures (which have their own internal space depending on what you build), gather resources, etc.
[00:46:46] <imode> if you walked up to an occupied block (one that's one Z level taller), you'd have to climb over it, which would draw from your energy pool.
[00:47:00] <imode> same for things like harvesting wood from trees, etc.
[00:47:15] <imode> was pretty neat, I might actually take that as a weekend project.

[07:40:54] <manicennui> dimadima: Not yet.
[07:41:27] <dimadima> ranchers talking
[07:41:40] <manicennui> I was checking out a book on Amazon and B&N and realized that I like B&N's product pages way better.
[07:46:51] <dimadima> i've never super liked B&N branding but amazon is a bit casino-like on many product pages
[07:46:54] <dimadima> and in general
[07:49:46] <manicennui> The big thing for me is that B&N still has a Table of Contents section for this book, but on Amazon I had to use the preview features, find the ToC, and then it was one of those super limited ToC with just the high level section names.
[07:50:27] <manicennui> And there are no third-party sellers on B&N.
[07:50:33] <manicennui> So fucking tired of that on Amazon.
[07:51:04] <manicennui> Not every book seems to have a ToC section on B&N unfortunately.
[07:52:22] <manicennui> Looks like B&N might be worse if the book doesn't have a ToC section because their preview is worse.
[08:00:49] <bontaq> I got a third party seller on B&N, took forever to ship
[08:01:50] <manicennui> Oh?
[08:01:57] <manicennui> I didn't notice any third-party sellers.
[08:02:06] <manicennui> That sucks.
[08:03:04] <manicennui> Really doesn't seem like they have any.
[08:03:17] <manicennui> Do you mean they drop-shipped it from the manufacturer?
[08:04:20] <manicennui> https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/abblog/blog.pl?/pl/2020/3/1583248179.html
[08:04:21] <buttsbot> Barnes & Noble Is Closing Its Third Party Seller Marketplace
[08:04:29] <manicennui> Looks like they got rid of them.
[08:04:49] <bontaq> Oh that's rad
[08:06:17] <manicennui> The only case where I like third-party sellers on Amazon is when they are selling their own products.
[08:06:46] <manicennui> There is a candy company that I really like that sells on Amazon.
[08:07:17] <manicennui> I hate when it is some company I couldn't possibly research, like some random company setup to sell towels.
[08:07:34] <manicennui> And I never want to use a third-party seller when it is something Amazon actually stocks.
[08:07:51] <manicennui> I think I'm going to go back to buying direct more often.
[08:11:11] <dimadima> i think i bought fake nike sneakers from a third party seller on amazon. i bought a pair at DSW that i really liked, got the "same" ones from amazon, and they were quite different in fit and feel
[08:11:32] <dimadima> i couldn't compare too much materials etc cause they were each different styles
[08:11:53] <dimadima> the uncertainy of fakeness with generic third-party sellers is the worst thing about them
[08:12:21] <manicennui> A lot of them are also just selling cheap garbage that they had made in China and sell for cheap, like the towels example.
[08:12:41] <manicennui> There is no way to research wether their towels are any good beyond the reviews on Amazon.
[08:12:45] <manicennui> whether
[08:13:13] <manicennui> Most of the cheaper sheets and towels and such I have bought from Amazon have been garbage.
[08:13:31] <manicennui> Amazon also got in on the game with their own brand.
[08:13:44] <manicennui> They were good for certain things like cables, but they are terrible for linens and towels.
[08:13:53] <dimadima> the reviews thing on amazon is also insulting
[08:13:59] <dimadima> and makes me not want to shop there
[08:14:23] <bontaq> yeah I've given up on amazon for the most part for products, ordering from other more specialized places has worked out better.  Even if the "specialization" is pretty huge like B&N or home depot / lowes
[08:14:58] <dimadima> or target / walmart even
[08:15:12] <dimadima> though i noticed walmart.com had third party sellers
[08:15:17] <dimadima> iirc
[08:15:21] <manicennui> It's amazing that we have come to the point where Walmart and Home Depot are better options.
[08:15:46] <manicennui> Remember the backlash against "big box stores" a couple decades ago?
[08:15:56] <manicennui> I bet Best Buy is even somehow better in some cases.
[08:16:34] <dimadima> it's not amazon
[08:16:44] <manicennui> I really miss certain chains, like Tower Records.
[08:17:03] <dimadima> did tower records have used music?
[08:17:11] <dimadima> most chain record stores were way out of my budget
[08:17:16] <dimadima> all really
[08:17:36] <manicennui> dimadima: I don't remember any, but they had a huge selection, including an entire room dedicated to classical.
[08:17:46] <manicennui> And all kinds of special events.
[08:17:51] <bontaq> best buy's pretty decent, I used their in store pickup to get some things I forgot while building a computer
[08:18:00] <bontaq> and a new hard drive after I fried mine

[08:18:38] <manicennui> As part of a 2002 settlement with 41 states over CD price fixing Tower Records, along with retailers Musicland and Trans World Entertainment, agreed to pay a $3 million fine.[7] It is estimated that between 1995 and 2000 customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album.[8]
[08:18:40] <manicennui> LOL?
[08:18:40] <dimadima> i miss circulars and stuff like that
[08:19:03] <manicennui> bontaq: I was just talking with a coworker about all of the computer stores closing up.
[08:19:08] <manicennui> CompUSA, Fry's, etc.
[08:19:11] <dimadima> yeah those stores were all collusion makes sense
[08:19:28] <dimadima> mirocenter exists here
[08:19:40] <bontaq> oh yeah those're long gone.  in nyc we still have microcenter hanging on and it's pretty cool
[08:20:01] <dimadima> bontaq: that one in brooklyn like by bay ridge?
[08:20:09] <dimadima> you drive past it on the bqe
[08:20:40] <manicennui> Amazon has basically taken the Walmart model to the next level.
[08:20:50] <manicennui> Now we can get cheap shit that is even shittier.
[08:20:54] <manicennui> And more convenient.
[08:21:10] *** Joins: art_vandelay (~art_vande@142.126.234.156)
[08:21:31] <bontaq> yerp, I gotta dump best buy for just them and sometimes B&H.  the microcenter's kinda a pain to get to tho
[08:21:36] <manicennui> I bet that Walmart's cheap products are better than Amazon's brand in many cases.
[08:21:53] <manicennui> B&H still hanging on, eh?
[08:22:14] * manicennui wonders where he can get film developed here.
[08:22:24] <dimadima> walmart seems to have specially made product that is inferior
[08:22:40] <dimadima> i bought diapers there that i'd only bought at target before
[08:22:54] <bontaq> yeah B&H has been doing great every time I've been through there
[08:22:55] <dimadima> and the walmart ones are markedly thinner
[08:23:55] <manicennui> Seems the drug store chains still do film development.
[08:24:26] <dimadima> what
[08:24:50] <dimadima> that's surprising
[08:25:00] <manicennui> Disposable cameras are still a thing.
[08:25:13] <dimadima> that's weird
[08:25:45] <dimadima> 10 years they won't be?
[08:26:15] <manicennui> No idea.
[08:26:28] <manicennui> There is still some need for developing photos, but it is pretty niche.
[08:27:01] <dimadima> disposable though
[08:27:08] <dimadima> that's extra niche
[08:27:08] <manicennui> I wonder whether it will experience a resurgence.
[08:27:15] <dimadima> film?
[08:27:16] <manicennui> Oh, I have no idea why those are still a thing.
[08:27:20] <manicennui> Yes.
[08:27:28] <dimadima> naa
[08:27:51] <manicennui> I think the lack of options for developing film is probably the main thing that will prevent it.
[08:28:05] <dimadima> no
[08:28:13] <dimadima> well
[08:28:17] <dimadima> now that that's the case, yes
[08:28:42] <dimadima> that and the reason why it's come to this in the first place; that people would rather shoot onto memory cards
[08:29:17] <dimadima> is what would prevent the resurgence of film
[08:29:31] <dimadima> film is stressful and expensive
[08:29:40] <manicennui> People would rather stream music, but vinyl has seen a resurgence.
[08:29:46] <manicennui> So much so that new production capacity had to be built.
[08:29:59] <dimadima> vinyl is not stressful and expensive like film is
[08:30:07] <manicennui> Vinyl is not cheap.
[08:30:19] <dimadima> but it's not like film
[08:30:28] <dimadima> there's a total asymmetry in film vs digital
[08:30:38] <manicennui> I think you are arguing against a strawman.
[08:30:47] <manicennui> I'm not claiming that the average person will return to film.
[08:30:51] <dimadima> i don't think film vs vinyl are comparable
[08:30:54] <manicennui> Just as the average person isn't buying vinyl.
[08:31:08] <dimadima> vinyl is basically mainstream
[08:31:12] <manicennui> Nah
[08:31:15] <dimadima> among people who buy music?
[08:31:18] <dimadima> who buys music anymore?
[08:31:27] <dimadima> very few people
[08:31:34] <manicennui> You are now comparing only a subset of the industry.
[08:31:35] <dimadima> relative to before at least
[08:31:50] <manicennui> Like a tiny fraction of it.
[08:31:52] <dimadima> i'm saying people who listen to music pay for spotify
[08:32:08] <manicennui> Yes.
[08:32:14] <manicennui> And very few of those people buy vinyl.
[08:32:15] <dimadima> people who buy music are now more likely to be nich music fans
[08:32:20] <dimadima> who buy vinyl
[08:32:38] <manicennui> People who buy music are a tiny fraction.
[08:32:40] <manicennui> They are not mainstream.
[08:32:46] <dimadima> okay
[08:32:46] <manicennui> Vinyl is not mainstream.
[08:33:00] <dimadima> right
[08:33:25] <dimadima> well, within those who buy :)
[08:33:48] <bontaq> it wouldn't surprise me if film comes back in some ways, it's just too bad color film is a huge PIA to develop yourself
[08:33:49] <manicennui> I feel like you are still arguing that film won't become popular among average people again, which is not what I claimed.
[08:33:58] <dimadima> i donno i wouldn't buy anything but vinyl or CD today
[08:34:09] <bontaq> but now's a great time for cheap projectors and the best film cameras ever made
[08:34:35] <manicennui> https://kosmofoto.com/2020/01/eastman-kodaks-still-film-production-more-than-doubled-in-the-last-four-years/
[08:34:38] <buttsbot> Eastman Kodak's still film production more than doubled in the last four years - Kosmo Foto
[08:35:48] <bontaq> hell yeah
[08:36:25] <manicennui> I still have a Nikon film body.
[08:37:12] <manicennui> Whenever we move to computerized shit we seem to completely stop caring about quality.
[08:37:32] <dimadima> digital SLRs are incredibly high quality
[08:37:33] <manicennui> The sensors on most digital cameras are far too small.
[08:37:49] <manicennui> And the lenses are garbage.
[08:37:51] <dimadima> welp the baseline overall is higher
[08:38:02] <manicennui> dimadima: Of course.
[08:38:03] <dimadima> not having a camera vs. having a shitty camera
[08:38:12] <manicennui> We all had cameras before.
[08:38:20] <bontaq> yeah I dunno if that segue makes sense in the context of disposable film cameras
[08:38:24] <dimadima> i do find it kind of annoying any time someone is like "the iphone camera is so amazon" (which happens all the time)
[08:38:37] <manicennui> So amazon?
[08:38:45] <manicennui> Amazing?
[08:38:48] <dimadima> the iphone camera, while pretty cool in its dynamic range, is still pretty shitty
[08:38:52] <manicennui> Yeah, smartphone cameras are all garbage.
[08:38:54] <dimadima> so amazing, my bad
[08:39:06] <manicennui> Fine for taking photos of things that don't matter.
[08:39:10] <dimadima> iphones have some good AI going on or something
[08:39:13] <dimadima> but the quality sucks
[08:39:21] <manicennui> And for recording cops while they break the law.
[08:39:38] <dimadima> i love my dad's 5D MkII and pro lenses
[08:39:50] <manicennui> All smartphone cameras suck. There is only so much you can do with a tiny sensor and lense.
[08:39:59] <dimadima> they sucks
[08:40:01] <dimadima> suck
[08:40:05] <dimadima> we totally agree
[08:40:24] <dimadima> we can stop chatting now
[08:40:26] <manicennui> I have a Nikon film body and DSLR and lenses that work on both.
[08:40:39] <dimadima> yeah nikon is like that
[08:40:49] <dimadima> canon changed their lenses
[08:40:57] <manicennui> I want to get back into photography, but I'd feel a bit weird carrying a SLR around in the city these days.
[08:41:02] <dimadima> you can et an adapter
[08:41:08] <dimadima> yeah i don't think you can do that anymore
[08:41:23] <manicennui> I think you can, but people will stare.
[08:41:25] <dimadima> surveillance has ruined photography
[08:41:33] <dimadima> cause everyone is rightfully sensitive
[08:41:41] <dimadima> rightly*
[08:41:46] <manicennui> Meanwhile you can use your shitty smartphone camera to take photos of everything and everyone acts like it is normal.
[08:41:56] <dimadima> i guess
[08:42:02] <manicennui> Can't eat a meal or drink something without taking a photo.
[08:42:18] <dimadima> shit's so cool looking
[08:42:22] <dimadima> though
[08:42:29] <dimadima> i must take a picture
[08:42:32] * manicennui tries to make poop pics a thing
[08:42:40] <dimadima> no
[08:43:03] <bontaq> I don't think it'd be too weird with an SLR
[08:43:07] <bontaq> pls no poop pics
[08:43:23] <manicennui> In 2030 Apple releases the new iPhone 22 with poop pip enhancement tech.
[08:43:28] <manicennui> For low light toilet situations.
[08:43:39] <manicennui> s/pip/pic/
[08:44:06] <manicennui> Imagine the smartphone makers releasing marketing material claiming that their product takes the best poop pics.
[08:44:21] <manicennui> And on the other side of things, I'll start fad diets for making one's poop look best.
[08:44:33] <dimadima> welp that's an app idea
[08:44:54] <dimadima> "AI" app that you take pictures of you poop w/ and it tells you how you're healthy or dying etc
[08:45:04] <manicennui> Beets become popular to add that red diffusion to your poop pic.
[08:45:12] <dimadima> it can tell that
[08:45:22] <bontaq> I'm surprised it's not one already, that provides a poo score, and built into apple health
[08:45:26] <dimadima> that's one of its main features
[08:45:39] <dimadima> yeah
[08:46:23] <manicennui> I saw a poop pic on reddit recently.
[08:46:31] <manicennui> It was a nurse carrying a bedpan with a monster log.
[08:47:12] <manicennui> I think that person won.
[08:48:00] <bontaq> lool I saw that one as well I think reposted to /r/nursing
[08:48:27] <manicennui> A lot of nurses probably have good poop stories.
[08:48:47] <dimadima> you guys both saw the same poop pic on reddit?
[08:49:21] <dimadima> man
[08:49:29] <manicennui> See, it is taking off.
[08:50:52] <manicennui> Once it is mainstream, we can argue about whether medium format is better for poop pics.
[08:51:09] <manicennui> To capture their majesty.
[08:53:09] <manicennui> https://www.dw.com/en/analog-photography-makes-a-comeback/a-59373991
[08:53:09] <buttsbot> Analog photography makes a comeback | Culture | Arts, music and lifestyle reporting from Germany | DW | 02.10.2021
[08:53:20] <manicennui> Competitor Fujifilm relies primarily on its Polaroid cameras in addition to photographic film. Those, too, have seen a significant upswing in the last 10 years. In 2010, the company sold just under half a million of its "Instax" models worldwide; last year, it was 10 million.
[08:53:55] <manicennui> " Unsurprisingly, prices for analog cameras and photographic film have spiked in recent years."
[08:53:59] <manicennui> Perhaps I should try to sell mine now.
[08:54:21] <manicennui> Nope, look very cheap on ebay.
[08:54:45] <bontaq> huh looking at leica 3Fs on ebay and they're definitely more expensive than I remember from a couple years ago
[08:55:11] <manicennui> Maybe the model I have is just not in demand. It's nothing special for an SLR.
[08:55:16] <bontaq> you could get one with a lens for ~3-500 and now they're just bodies for more
[08:55:42] <manicennui> I feel like Leicas are always overpriced.
[08:56:21] <manicennui> I don't think the price has much to do with its abilities.
[08:57:13] <manicennui> "The price increase has also drawn new competitors into the market, for instance the German start-up Silbersalz."
[08:57:30] <manicennui> "For the past two years, the Stuttgart-based production company has been offering its own analog film based on Kodak cinema film under the name Silbersalz35 — and at comparatively low prices."
[08:58:09] *** Joins: gco (~gco@2601:647:4c80:2424:6d7b:d9aa:d590:cbee)
[08:58:17] <manicennui> Hmm.
[08:58:23] <manicennui> The price includes processing and scanning.
[08:58:27] <manicennui> Interesting model.
[09:00:11] <manicennui> "According to Japan's Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA), digital camera sales plummeted nearly 90% between 2010 and 2019, with the COVID crisis worsening it."
[09:00:27] <bontaq> lool phones
[09:01:03] <manicennui> The extra annoying part about camera photos is the culture around them.
[09:01:09] <manicennui> IG is terrible for viewing photos.
[09:01:36] <manicennui> You get a tiny version of the photo, and you can only zoom by pinching and zooming and holding it open.
[09:01:45] <manicennui> As soon as you let go it goes back to the tiny photo.
[09:01:59] <manicennui> And the web version doesn't allow any zooming
[09:02:26] <manicennui> On some sites you can open the photo in a new tab to see the full resolution photo, but that is kind of a pain too.
[09:02:33] <manicennui> And clearly not intended by the site.
[09:02:59] <manicennui> Of course most phone photos look pretty bad when you zoom in.

[21:35:50] <gwozniak> I thought it was some Onion thing when I first read the title
[21:35:52] <riv> it looks like reddit when you see the comments
[21:44:46] <kline> remember on something awful when people would start threads like this just as a honeypot to flush out all the bad posters who hadnt integrated and they banned everyone in them?
[21:45:07] <riv>  i wish they would do that here
[21:46:56] <kline> no mod actions since before it was posted
[21:47:00] <kline> so might still happen
[21:48:23] <riv> thing is nobody is doing anything actually wrong

[21:48:35] <riv> but it's really lame and not what i want out of the site
[21:48:42] <riv> but if other people want the site to go this way, then that's fine
[21:55:30] <demiurge> i'm not sure about the arch post. it doesn't seem off-topic, just... contentless
[21:55:42] <Xe> it is good satire
[21:55:51] <gwozniak> I flagged it as OT
[21:56:10] <gwozniak> Not that it matters much, given the current upvote count
[21:56:13] <demiurge> the argument in the comments is shitty
[21:57:39] <kline> theres nothing in that submission or the comments that i felt was worth reading
[21:57:41] <demiurge> i guess you could make the argument that it doesn't have any technical content and is therefore OT, but im not sure
[21:57:49] <kline> its derivative memeing
[21:57:53] <Xe> >> Can someone explain the joke here?
[21:57:55] <Xe> > I’ll explain it to you once I finish this mad CrossFit workout. You should totally do CrossFit, by the way. Check out my InstaTok for some sick ideas on how ripped CrossFit can make you. CrossFit.
[21:57:57] <Xe> this was so good
[21:58:02] <demiurge> a flag reason for "contentless memery" would make me feel better
[21:58:44] <kline> i definitely feel like a certain number of flags should autohide a post until moderated
[21:59:21] <demiurge> i'm sufficiently pedantic that flagging this for OT when its nominal topic is on-topic feels... wrong, somehow
[21:59:32] <demiurge> but on reflection something with no content should be considered OT by default
[22:00:09] <demiurge> Xe: i do think that comment is funny, but i don't think it's really worth it to have the site full of stuff like that
[22:00:33] <Xe> i added a feature to my blog :> https://github.com/Xe/site/blob/main/static/js/hnwarn.js
[22:00:33] <buttsbot> site/hnwarn.js at main · Xe/site · GitHub
[22:00:34] <kline> just consider that "on topic" for the site is something that gives you something to think about or improve your skill in tech
[22:00:55] <kline> in which case analyses, etc are on topic, and contentless stuff is not
[22:01:00] <kline> even though its tech-related
[22:01:30] <gwozniak> I'd classify this one as tech adjacent, tbh
[22:01:32] <kline> " Some rules of thumb for great stories to submit: Will this improve the reader's next program? Will it deepen their understanding of their last program? Will it be more interesting in five or ten years? "

[22:01:44] <kline> this post hits none of those
[22:02:12] <kline> its on tech, but the onus is on the post to prove itself on-topic given it hits none of these, not the other way around
[22:02:16] <imode> half of the things posted to the site are off-topic then.
[22:04:30] <kline> well then
[22:08:35] <imode> am I wrong? :P
[22:15:40] <riv> you are right, the lack of moderation is letting the site drift towards.. idk, lower effort content that's less interesting

[22:20:16] <Xe> ngoldbaum: how unholy are we talking?
[22:21:43] <ngoldbaum> it was a wrapper that made it possible to work on both git and hg repositories from the same interface and had to paper over *all* of the corner cases where git and hg’s data models are subtly different, a fundamentally ill-posed problem

[22:27:37] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: it was a server that let devs push with both git and hg clients and it synced between by round-tripping, all without history rewriting on the clientside

[23:39:34] <buttsbot> Det här Luciatåget i Bollnäs är nog det finaste jag sett. : sweden
[23:40:11] <bkero> I might be flying to Chicago soon if I win an auction.
[23:40:17] <bkero> Pick up car, drive back.
[23:40:51] <manicennui> Probably the worst time to fly here.
[23:41:01] <manicennui> Never know when everything is going to be fucked by weather.
[23:41:16] <bkero> I fully expect ORD to be fucked by weather every day after 2PM.
[23:41:19] <manicennui> What kind of car?
[23:41:24] <bkero> But the good thing is I'm flying *in* and not *out*

[23:41:26] <buttsbot> 2019 Volkswagen Golf SE  | eBay
[23:41:45] <bkero> Golf Alltrack 6 speed manual, low miles, good price
[23:41:51] <manicennui> Anything special about it or just hard to find exactly what you want?
[23:42:13] <manicennui> Is it really a 1.8T and not a 2.0?
[23:43:22] <manicennui> I had a 1.8T Jetta. It was a blast to drive.
[23:43:51] <bkero> AWD manual wagon
[23:43:59] <bkero> It's a unicorn.
[23:44:19] <manicennui> Yeah, I didn't realize they did AWD VWs.
[23:44:30] <manicennui> One of their techniques to get you to pay for an Audi.
[23:44:48] <manicennui> Always thought the FWD GTI was a bit silly.
[23:45:30] <manicennui> Not that it is actually any faster than the normal Golf.
[23:45:39] <imode> also _what_
[23:45:41] <manicennui> But even in my 1.8T Jetta it was easy to get the wheels to slip.
[23:45:53] <imode> log4j has a _new_ denial of service vuln?
[23:46:48] * manicennui wonders which other language has a popular logging library that does crazy shit.
[23:48:26] <manicennui> https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.3/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html
[23:48:27] <buttsbot> Class: Logger (Ruby 2.6.3)
[23:48:41] <manicennui> "Note: Logger does not escape or sanitize any messages passed to it. Developers should be aware of when potentially malicious data (user-input) is passed to Logger, and manually escape the untrusted data"
[23:48:49] <manicennui> That sounds ominous.
[23:49:29] <imode> why are logging frameworks vulnerable to not sanitizing input.
[23:49:46] <imode> the first step you do is log.
[23:50:02] <imode> how shit do you have to be to do that.
[23:50:16] <imode> and since this is FOSS, how collectively shit do we have to be to do that.
[23:50:24] <manicennui> The example they show is putting user input directly into the string with one of Ruby's string interpolation methods.
[23:50:37] <manicennui> I'm not sure what could go wrong other than logging shit you don't want.
[23:51:00] <manicennui> logger.info("User-input: #{input.dump}")
[23:51:48] <imode> that could be a ruby expression.
[23:51:54] <imode> ...I think?
[23:52:29] <manicennui> It won't turn a string into a method automatically.
[23:52:40] <manicennui> Something else would have to be broken.
[23:53:09] <manicennui> And Ruby's labmdas/procs require call().
[23:53:54] <manicennui> And it won't turn a string into a lambda automatically anyways.
[23:54:09] <manicennui> Somehow dump would have to be turned into something else by something else.
