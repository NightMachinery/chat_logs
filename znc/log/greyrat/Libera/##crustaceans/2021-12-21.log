[19:57:14] <dimadima> i wouldn't trust the experiment vaccine either :S
[19:57:23] <gwozniak> There will be pop-up clinics that will administer them to those who wait in line
[19:57:43] <dimadima> how chic
[19:58:03] <dimadima> fwiw it's almost february
[19:58:31] <gwozniak> Also, some people are just mad because they can't get it "right now"
[19:59:28] <dimadima> i'd be frustrated... in the godforasken US you can basically get it "right now"
[19:59:34] <dimadima> walgreens is doing walkins
[19:59:35] <gwozniak> I expect this will change such that more 3rd doses are administered faster
[19:59:39] <companion_cube> yeah, just walk into CVS or whatever
[19:59:42] <companion_cube> it's luxury
[19:59:48] <dimadima> it really is
[20:00:10] <gwozniak> I don't know where Canada is getting its doses lately, nor how many are here
[20:01:18] <gwozniak> But I do know that the provincial gov't has not spent $2 billion the feds gave it to help with the rollout of covid-related health measures
[20:01:43] <gwozniak> They want to save the money to pay down the debt, I guess
[20:01:44] <dimadima> vaxx4u2xctqmepjg.onion
[20:02:04] <dimadima> heh gwozniak
[20:02:56] <dimadima> is ontario conservative?
[20:03:03] <gwozniak> Yup
[20:03:18] <gwozniak> Doug Ford, Rob Ford's older brother, is premier
[20:03:30] <dimadima> wow!
[20:03:34] <dimadima> i had no idea...
[20:03:41] <gwozniak> A friend of mine is on the science advisory council and he was saying the provincial gov't is basically trying to save money at every turn, so none of the money allocated for covid is being spent
[20:03:42] <dimadima> and he is... conservative?
[20:03:47] <gwozniak> Yup
[20:04:02] <gwozniak> "Ontario's Archie Bunker"
[20:04:08] <dimadima> is he also a chris farley type
[20:04:18] <dimadima> ah archie bunker
[20:05:09] <gwozniak> Less of a bafoon than his (now deceased) brother, but still pretty dopey
[20:05:13] <dimadima> saving money is good but covid vaccines seem mportant
[20:05:29] <companion_cube> iT's JuSt A FlU
[20:05:43] <gwozniak> He says he cares, but his policies show that he just wants everything to be open again, no matter what

[20:38:25] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: Kinda. It's a bit more, but it is a log consumer, yes
[20:39:07] <Brekkjern> The idea is to have all logs in one service to make alerts and rules in
[20:39:26] <Brekkjern> I think it's probably better for a SOC than for developers though
[20:42:59] <indigo> Oi Brekkjern! You feeling better?
[20:43:44] <manicennui> gwozniak: Yes.
[20:44:01] <manicennui> gwozniak: It is good when it is able to parse the data and you can then search on those fields.
[20:44:09] <manicennui> gwozniak: But I often just want to find messages with a specific string.
[20:44:26] <manicennui> And the larger the time range, and the further back in time it goes, the slower it is.
[20:44:53] <Brekkjern> indigo: yeah. I was back to work again on Tuesday last week, and now I am on holiday chillaxing :)
[20:45:04] <manicennui> I wanted to search the October 1st log, and it took forever.
[20:45:05] <indigo> Neat!! Enjoy your holiday
[20:45:08] <manicennui> Would have been super fast with grep.
[20:45:20] <indigo> I have the 24th and the 27th off so that's nice
[20:45:38] <gwozniak> ``I think there will come a major consolidation period that “centralizes” web3 into a few L1 chains.  That plus major regulation overhaul will finally make crypto more legit''

[20:46:17] <Brekkjern> I had quite a bit of time off available, so I won't be back to work until the 3rd of Jan I believe :)
[20:46:21] <manicennui> I started to read the description of what it was and checked out.
[20:46:27] <indigo> Nice!!
[20:46:53] <manicennui> I use too much PTO during the year.
[20:47:00] <manicennui> I was down to 14 hours this month.
[20:47:05] <Brekkjern> Now I'm gonna sit down and have dinner while watching WoT and The Expanse :)
[20:47:08] <indigo> I'm at ~150 hours
[20:47:18] <manicennui> But we do have this Friday and next off.
[20:47:25] <manicennui> And I'm going to take next Thursday off.
[20:47:28] <indigo> Nice, enjoy :-)
[20:47:38] <manicennui> I took the week of Thanksgiving off.
[20:48:07] <manicennui> I just hit 7 years with the company, so now I get 26 days off per year.
[20:48:09] <manicennui> Plus holidays.
[20:48:26] <indigo> gwozniak: Putting your IRC logs in Splunk is a good way to check it out
[20:48:37] <indigo> manicennui: That's really nice
[20:48:47] <manicennui> indigo: For an American, sure.
[20:49:22] <indigo> I think I'm going to get boosted to 20 days per year soon
[20:50:29] <ngoldbaum> indigo: i thought you were talking about vaccines with that “boosted” comment and got confused
[20:50:45] <manicennui> indigo is going to take a run at the king.
[20:50:47] <indigo> ngoldbaum: I've been getting boosted every week
[20:51:05] <indigo> manicennui: I best not miss
[20:51:14] <manicennui> I think 20 is about 10 short right now.
[20:51:43] <indigo> Sometimes I do wonder how it would be to have EU-style vacation

[20:52:54] <indigo> MAXIMUM TITERS
[20:53:02] <manicennui> indigo: And not have health insurance tied to work.
[20:57:57] <manicennui> I wish I worked at a company where the managers read /r/antiwork and fretted.
[20:58:14] <manicennui> Maybe our call center managers do.
[21:01:14] <gwozniak> I have never worked in the service industry, but I did work in manual labour and I can relate to some of the little I see on r/antiwork
[21:01:37] <manicennui> I have had all kinds of jobs.
[21:01:45] <manicennui> I have mixed opinions on a lot of it.
[21:01:56] <manicennui> But I do think people should be treated well and paid a living wage.
[21:02:11] <manicennui> Don't have any sympathy for businesses that only work if they pay slave wages.
[21:02:48] <indigo> OTOH, I have my coworkers complaining that they are getting a pay cut after their four year vesting cliff ;)
[21:03:00] <manicennui> The least bad company I worked for was probably Target.
[21:03:16] <manicennui> But they still did the annoying "every week the schedule is different" thing.
[21:03:33] <ngoldbaum> if they want a raise after vesting they should just interview somewhere else
[21:03:36] <manicennui> And I was hired during the holiday season, and instead of making it clear that they didn't really need me after that, they just stopped giving me hours.
[21:05:02] <manicennui> I also didn't experience a lot of dumbass coworkers at Target.
[21:05:05] <manicennui> But most other jobs I did.
[21:05:10] <manicennui> Just completely useless people.
[21:05:31] <manicennui> Was easy to get extra hours if you wanted by working shifts for people who didn't want to work.
[21:05:47] <manicennui> And usually a couple people who stole or something.
[21:08:37] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/n3xem1dm8w681.png
[21:09:51] <gwozniak> There were some seriously dumb and/or vindictive assholes when I worked in construction
[21:10:30] <gwozniak> And there were some really nice and helpful people
[21:11:51] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Agreed... also I don't really understand the hyper focus on promotion
[21:12:04] <manicennui> The worst I've had in managers in the non-corporate worlds was usually just managers who didn't do much.
[21:12:17] <manicennui> The truly evil managers I've had have been at corporate office jobs.
[21:12:34] <gwozniak> indigo: promotion is just... not something I care about
[21:12:48] <manicennui> indigo: Everyone thinks they should be promoted every 18-24 months now.
[21:13:19] <manicennui> "I managed to not be fired for a couple of years. I deserve a promotion!"
[21:13:42] <ngoldbaum> mfs think google gonna give them a pension or something
[21:14:11] <ngoldbaum> staying at a tech company for longer than 2-3 years is leaving money on the table
[21:15:01] <indigo> In the bay area, sure. Harder when you are in other areas
[21:15:48] <manicennui> Generally true here too (Chicago).
[21:15:48] <indigo> Thankfully money isn't everything
[21:15:54] <manicennui> But you will probably top out sooner.
[21:16:07] <manicennui> Although now where you live matters less.
[21:16:13] <manicennui> You can get a West Coast job remotely.
[21:16:24] <manicennui> We've had people leave for this reason.
[21:17:36] <manicennui> I could probably do another 20% or so locally.
[21:17:57] <manicennui> But my total compensation is pretty good for this area.

[21:24:08] <indigo> Apparently one of the comments says that they weren't done moving out yet?
[21:25:16] <manicennui> I kind of believe the follow-up comment speculating that they said that as an excuse.
[21:25:36] <manicennui> Even without that, the damage to the house is ridiculous.
[21:25:48] <indigo> Yeah like how do you mess up the floor like that
[21:26:06] <manicennui> These comments are really bad though. Too many dead animal stories.
[21:26:56] <manicennui> Two dead cows, a dead dog, and a saved bearded dragon.
[21:27:21] <manicennui> One saved dog and two saved cats.
[21:27:44] <ngoldbaum> seems to be a lot of nightmare tenants out there
[21:27:44] <gwozniak> I mean, I have not always been a fan of my landlords over the years, but I have always respected the property when I move out
[21:28:12] <manicennui> I had my last place deep cleaned because I had cats.
[21:28:19] <indigo> I always spend way too much time cleaning the old apt when I move out
[21:28:25] <manicennui> Landlord was also pretty good.
[21:28:44] <ngoldbaum> this is how you get credit checks, background checks, income proof on even shitty rentals
[21:29:03] <gwozniak> Leaving a pet behind is just unfathomable to me
[21:29:19] <gwozniak> Even if they weren't "done moving out yet"
[21:29:26] <manicennui> gwozniak: Yeah, I get really emotional over animals being treated poorly.
