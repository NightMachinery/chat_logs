[02:53:33] <alix> i'm lucky, they're all great
[02:53:36] <alix> why are yours tough?
[02:54:49] <lalia> Not a topic I'm looking to dig into, TBH. It's not cathartic to dwell on for me: I wanted to vent for a second tho. It's been a long fucking day. :P

[02:55:49] <lalia> Need to recover some energy and see about reviewing for a Euthydemus discussion tomorrow.
[02:56:53] <Parf> thankfully time spent with the fams is usually worth it. even the drudgery. somehow we can take from the past something worthwhile from it. an exercise of love, humanity, responsibility. medicine doesn't taste too good

[02:57:48] <Parf> so who's euthydemus
[02:58:20] <lalia> Hopefully most folks find it worthwhile. I'm not entirely sure in my case, but that's alright. :3 Life often fails to be a real good time. :P
[02:58:50] <lalia> Euthydemis was supposedly a sophist from around Athens during the lifetime of Socrates.
[02:58:58] <lalia> There's a dialogue named after him.
[03:07:26] *** Joins: stkrdknmibalz (~test@rrcs-75-87-43-226.sw.biz.rr.com)
[03:13:30] <Parf> did he have any distinguishing marks?
[03:25:47] <lalia> So, in short, the dialogue uses Euthydemus and another prominent sophist from the time period as examples of figures who win arguments through rhetorical tricks. He outlines examples in the dialogue. The idea seems to be to mock the use of word games and cast them as shameful.
[03:25:55] <lalia> Funny piece too.

[03:36:12] <arryana> i need to get back on to reading plato
[03:54:29] <lalia> I've been reading a book by Katja Vogt where she argues Plato can be read as never having diverged from the divine mission Socrates set him on: the pursuit of inquiry.
[03:55:07] <lalia> I'm about halfway through the book and am quite pursuaded by her argument that Plato can convincingly be read as a skeptic.
[03:55:21] <lalia> It's great work. :)

[17:25:27] <arryana> it's a lot more appropriate to call a helpline for suicidal thoughts than to discuss them in a chatroom

[17:31:44] <ThePhilosopher> That is the most patriotic house I have ever seen.
[17:32:24] <thedragon> magalicious!
[17:32:29] <ThePhilosopher> I wonder if it is in the USA?
[17:32:30] <ThePhilosopher> lol
[17:33:04] <arryana> some people are bound to make an identity of their politics
[17:33:13] * arryana shrugs
[17:33:44] <ThePhilosopher> Whatever floats your boat. If you love your country and want to be super patriotic. Go for it.
[17:34:02] <ThePhilosopher> For me I just have 2 USA flags on my deck.
[17:34:10] <ThePhilosopher> I'm modest.
[17:34:41] <voltage_> is there a moral obligation to stay alive?
[17:35:20] <ThePhilosopher> Can you elaborate?
[17:36:13] <voltage_> i was just thinking, philosophically speaking, how would you convince someone to stay alive?
[17:36:49] <arryana> i'm not really in a position to be 'patriotic'
[17:36:52] <voltage_> like assuming someone is suicidal but they're in their "right" state of mind, rational and all that, how would you try to convince someone to stay alive?
[17:37:11] <arryana> i mean, do i fly the flag of the country where i was born or the one i live in?
[17:37:29] <voltage_> might be a dumb question, but whatever
[17:38:35] <ThePhilosopher> When you decide that your life is no longer worth living that is a lack of imagination. Expanding one's ability to see past their current circumstances and imagine the infinite possibilities of what could happen is a good motivational tool. When you want to die and life is not worth living that is an opportunity for a clean slate. To release
[17:38:35] <ThePhilosopher> yourself from the chains that bind you to where you are, what you do, and how you think. Then allow yourself to do whatever it takes to become the person you have always wanted to be inside and out.
[17:39:23] <ThePhilosopher> You can fly both flags if you want.
[17:39:37] <ThePhilosopher> Depends on how much you love each country. Fly 1, fly 2, or fly none.
[17:39:42] <arryana> why should i fly any flag?
[17:39:57] <ThePhilosopher> If you love your country and you like the way it looks.
[17:40:10] <arryana> the placards around my house all say the same thing
[17:40:13] <arryana> 'beware of dogs'
[17:40:24] <arryana> that's good enough for me.
[17:40:37] <ThePhilosopher> Bring bacon. Then you don't have to worry about the dogs, because you have treats.
[17:40:49] <arryana> my dogs won't take food from strangers unless i say it's okay
[17:40:53] <arryana> you'd lose that bet
[17:41:03] <ThePhilosopher> 0_o
[17:41:09] <arryana> they're not food driven, never have been.  they work for praise.
[17:41:27] <ThePhilosopher> MMmk
[17:41:59] <voltage_> man, it's the globalists, they don't want people to love their countries
[17:42:12] <voltage_> i tell you mang, it's a conspiracy
[17:42:21] <arryana> the point is, my loyalties are not so generalized as whatever flag is to hand
[17:42:43] <arryana> i am happy to serve, i do at least ten hours of volunteer work a week
[17:42:55] <arryana> but as to a lot of rah-rah-rah about it, no thanks
[17:45:03] <arryana> each to their own.  if your flags work for you, more power to you.
[17:45:34] <ThePhilosopher> It all depends on the person's individual thoughts and feelings towards the subject matter. If you want to be patriotic and love your country go for it. If you have issues with where you live, or you simply just don't have the feeling inside which moves you to be patriotic. You just gotta do whatever you feel is right.
[17:45:54] <arryana> there are a lot of ways to be 'patriotic'
[17:45:56] <badsektor> w2hat is a 'globalist'? i live in the middle east and my neighbor and his wife called me a 'globalist' after a political discussion over beer
[17:46:24] <arryana> i personally believe that donating my time and efforts to my community is a more meaningful expression of
[17:46:30] <arryana> 'patriotism'
[17:46:34] <voltage_> it's when you believe nation states should be abolished and there should be a global government
[17:46:40] <ThePhilosopher> Who the hell knows anymore. Lately I akin globalist to fascism where we all have to believe and act one certain way, or hit the highway.
[17:47:03] <ThePhilosopher> Seems like the path everyone is labeling it as these days.
[17:47:06] <arryana> globalism is a silly dream
[17:47:13] <arryana> it's another utopia dallacy
[17:47:14] <badsektor> voltage_, thats bizarre i dont even believe that
[17:47:21] <badsektor> in that
[17:47:39] <arryana> it's a very nice concept.  it's a ridiculous fantasy that it would work in practice.
[17:47:53] <badsektor> i am an anarcho capitalist
[17:48:05] <arryana> look how limited the united nations is, and that's been around for decades.
[17:48:15] <ThePhilosopher> People are addicted to their label makers now a days. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Many have lost the ability to have logical, rational, and empathetic conversations due to brainwashing and social conditioning.

[17:49:21] <ThePhilosopher> No one in particular.
[17:49:22] <arryana> or is that a hyperbole deal
[17:49:29] <ThePhilosopher> hyperbole
[17:49:32] <arryana> gotcha
[17:50:10] <arryana> there are a lot of ways to live, in a lot of places.
[17:50:24] <arryana> not everywhere is consumed with all of that.
[17:50:43] <ThePhilosopher> So common sense still exists in the world?
[17:50:54] <ThePhilosopher> It's become a super power in western societies.
[17:51:15] <arryana> everyone has been saying that forever.
[17:51:27] <arryana> 'kids these days, no respect' goes back as long as kids have been hatching
[17:51:28] <ThePhilosopher> Doesn't make it any less true.
[17:51:34] <arryana> of course it's less true
[17:51:54] <arryana> what they don't respect is the social mores of two generations before

[17:53:15] <arryana> in a tribal or subsistance society, there's ongoing stability of role.  anything more developed than that, by nature, progresses.
[17:53:22] <arryana> and progress means leaving things behind.
[17:53:43] <arryana> it isn't a social decay, it's a social function.

[17:54:10] <arryana> hahah
[17:54:23] <arryana> only forward, chief.  there is no going back.
[17:54:41] <voltage_> all forward
[17:54:48] <voltage_> <cliff ahead>
[17:54:52] <arryana> you can take things from the past, but you can't recreate it
[17:54:53] <voltage_> jump!
[17:55:02] <ThePhilosopher> I look at the generations from 1990+ and think to myself. Dear god, they are actually only 10 IQ points higher than most chimpanzees, or gorillas in the wild.
[17:55:08] <arryana> ideally you can amalgamate it into a functional whole
[17:55:15] <badsektor> 100 years ago fascism was a progressive ideology
[17:55:37] <voltage_> hey, some would say it is now too
[17:55:40] <arryana> i think you are either hanging with the wrong young people or your opinion is coloring the reality
[17:55:41] <voltage_> lol
[17:56:04] <arryana> i have a whole lot of young friends, and i find their perspectives to be marvelous
[17:56:24] <ThePhilosopher> Oh there are of course exceptions to my viewpoint like everything else in life. My judgement is by what I see through social media, or random encounters in the wilds of society.
[17:56:40] <arryana> social media is the dregs and largely bullshit
[17:56:47] <arryana> that's like judging a society by the content of their latrines
[17:57:00] <ThePhilosopher> I'd say 75/25 short bus special to intelligent.
[17:57:09] * arryana shrugs
[17:57:13] <arryana> if that gets you through the day.
[17:57:39] <mnemon> arryana: they tend to disrespect any status quo so in that sense it's no less true these days :P
[17:57:43] <ThePhilosopher> It doesn't. I just really dislike the level of brainwashing, moral corruption, and outright stupidity.
[17:57:45] <badsektor> probably a hundred years ago eugenics was a progressive futuristic idea
[17:58:05] <ThePhilosopher> They didn't have to tell my generation to not eat tide pods.
[17:58:24] <arryana> of course they disrespect the status quo.  they were raised to be tolerant and accepting of all else.
[17:58:32] <mnemon> (they as in young people)
[17:58:34] <arryana> political correctness has a price.
[17:58:44] <ThePhilosopher> They were raised to be obedient slaves.
[17:58:52] * arryana rolls her eyes
[17:58:58] <ThePhilosopher> Just like the rest of us, only they kicked it into high gear.
[17:59:11] <arryana> uh huh
[17:59:33] <mnemon> ThePhilosopher: heavily authoritarian child rearing seems to be out of fashion these days at least in "the western world"
[17:59:47] <ThePhilosopher> 0_o
[18:00:20] <ThePhilosopher> Sure it is...
[18:00:31] <mnemon> but I suppose the parents might be helicoptering enough to compensate for it or something
[18:00:48] <badsektor> there must be more to progress than admitting racial or sexual minorities into the public sphere as equals
[18:01:03] <ThePhilosopher> It's authoritarian child rearing wearing a different much uglier costume.
[18:01:03] <arryana> it's a start.
[18:01:56] <ThePhilosopher> That's the misconception. When I was younger that was already a thing. Now they just use race and sex to divide us and hyper focus on our differences to keep us divided.
[18:02:29] * arryana just shakes her head
[18:02:51] <badsektor> sometimes it is the progressives who put too much emphasis on such differences, much more than needed, to the poin t it backfires
[18:02:57] <ThePhilosopher> You want real equality stop focusing on our differences. Giving entire an ethnicity a whole month to celebrate them. Start celebrating what makes us all human.
[18:03:25] <arryana> huh
[18:03:36] <arryana> to me that sounds like more utopian thinking.
[18:03:48] <voltage_> badsektor, true, nobody in the world cares but americans
[18:03:52] <arryana> what's really going to happen is that areas and people will splinter by type and interest
[18:04:04] <arryana> smaller communities, not bigger ones.
[18:04:10] <voltage_> expect obviously they're exporting their values globally
[18:04:20] <badsektor> i get it, if i was lgbt, i to would want the whole world to stop and be concerned about my plight too
[18:04:51] <badsektor> but i suspect there is more to life than that cause
[18:05:14] <ThePhilosopher> I just don't believe that we are going to make any progress by bringing attention and focus to individual races. There are so many other races that get left out. People talk about white privlege yet ignore the single white mother who works 3 jobs and lives in a trailer park. It is all an illusion to keep us divided and not allow us the opportunity
[18:05:14] <ThePhilosopher> to unite and bring about real positive change.
[18:05:31] <arryana> you want a comfortable revolution.  that's cute.
[18:05:47] <badsektor> 'revolution' is a dangerous idea
[18:05:54] <mnemon> arryana: extreme focus on the differences causes splintering.
[18:06:02] <ThePhilosopher> I said nothing about a revolution.
[18:06:11] <arryana> who is suggesting extreme focus?
[18:06:12] <ThePhilosopher> More about implementing common sense.
[18:06:23] <ThePhilosopher> Using existing frameworks.
[18:06:29] <badsektor> revolutionaries usually lack conscience, end up becoming the worst tyrants
[18:06:33] <arryana> i didn't say you wanted the revoltion
[18:07:28] <arryana> many revolutionaries are just people who believe something so much it consumes them
[18:07:36] <ThePhilosopher> What I want is mainstream media, politicians, social media, and oligarchs to stop meddling in how societies run and operate.
[18:07:47] <arryana> look at rosa parks
[18:07:54] <mnemon> arryana: thephilosopher was talking about hyper focus on differences and gave the unification as counter proposal
[18:07:55] <ThePhilosopher> Mind their own damn business and allow us to self govern ourselves.
[18:08:02] <arryana> hahah, the world doesn't work accordiung to what you want, you know
[18:08:09] <badsektor> i heard stalin had already said before the bolshevik revolution 'the last drop of love for humanity i had died with you' at his wife's funeral
[18:08:24] <arryana> ah, thanks mnemon
[18:09:52] <ThePhilosopher> I think morgan freeman summed it up nicely.
[18:09:55] <ThePhilosopher> https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthefederalistpapers.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F08%2F11855881_901781306570905_4412402339987624395_n.jpg&f=1&nofb=1
[18:10:11] <badsektor> arryana, sometimes the professional revolutionary is just a jackass with a hunger for adventure and heroism, and he doesn't care if what he is about to do is going to destroy the order of the lives of millions
[18:11:06] <voltage_> truuuue
[18:11:09] <arryana> those rarely go down in history as revolutionaries
[18:11:54] <badsektor> in fact those are the types that become successful and disrupt the lives of millions
[18:12:17] <badsektor> you can include the islamist revolutionaries in that fold, and think about this in light of the history of syria the past decade
[18:12:24] <ThePhilosopher> I would be thrilled if someone gave me access to billions of dollars. Oh the amount of positive change I could bring to this world.
[18:12:37] <ThePhilosopher> A fantasy of mine.
[18:13:01] <voltage_> no way
[18:13:14] <voltage_> you'd need trillions of dollars
[18:13:25] <badsektor> an adolescent with no family to worry about, ready to burn it all down for some thirst for adventure cloaked under self-righteous liesa and rationalization, that's a revolutionary
[18:13:25] <voltage_> inflation
[18:13:27] <ThePhilosopher> Sure, I'll take trillions.
[18:13:31] <ThePhilosopher> Sounds good to me.
[18:14:27] <voltage_> how would you bring about that change though, that's the question
[18:14:33] <ThePhilosopher> There are a lot of inventions, social programs, and charities I would fund.
[18:14:54] <ThePhilosopher> I would not want the limelight, or any attention really.
[18:15:07] <ThePhilosopher> If I could do it all from behind the scenes I would be thrilled.
[18:15:07] <voltage_> so you'd becoem the next george soros
[18:15:17] <voltage_> and people would hate you
[18:15:19] <voltage_> :P
[18:15:28] <ThePhilosopher> Even he is a puppet for people with power.
[18:15:35] <ThePhilosopher> I want no puppeteers.
[18:15:40] <voltage_> which people
[18:15:53] <voltage_> he can take down governments, man
[18:16:15] <ThePhilosopher> That's an interesting question. Why don't you explore that with independent research. It is quite an interesting rabbit hole to go down, but you may be uncomfortable with the answer.
[18:17:04] <voltage_> ok where do i start
[18:17:11] <ThePhilosopher> Follow the money.
[18:17:23] <voltage_> who has the most money
[18:17:32] <voltage_> elon musk?
[18:17:38] <ThePhilosopher> Not important as where it is coming from.
[18:17:43] <voltage_> i heard putin is secretly the most wealthy on the planet
[18:18:06] <voltage_> oil
[18:18:19] <ThePhilosopher> Having the most money is meaningless. Having the right amount of money to influence, control, and destroy others by actually doing it is.
[18:19:00] <ThePhilosopher> But alas, this is tin foil hat territory. If you want to research that subject matter use TOR (or) tails to cover your ass.
[18:19:24] <ThePhilosopher> It's not fool proof, but it will at least give you a certain base level of anonymity.
[18:19:45] <voltage_> yeah but where do i look man, you haven't said anything
[18:19:53] <voltage_> financial records of the vatican?
[18:20:12] <ThePhilosopher> That is not for me to say. That is a journey you must discover on your own.
[18:21:02] <voltage_> it is interesting but not worth the effort digging through trash
[18:21:08] <ThePhilosopher> It is a quest of seeking knowledge. You have a question, find your own answer. This is not me being mean, or withholding. I am simply stating it is a journey that each person must take on their own if they want true independent investigations.

[18:40:35] <lalia> How're you all today?
[18:41:23] <ThePhilosopher> Doing alright. Procrastinating a bit before taking care of the livestock and doing web development for 8 hours.
[18:41:30] <ThePhilosopher> lol
[18:41:31] <arryana> yay, lalia

[18:43:12] <voltage_> ThePhilosopher, you have a livestock?
[18:43:31] <ThePhilosopher> Indeed.
[18:43:44] <ThePhilosopher> I have a small homestead in the mountains.
[18:44:12] <ThePhilosopher> Better go out now. They are probably pissed that I am late with breakfast.
[18:44:13] <ThePhilosopher> lol
[18:44:30] <voltage_> cool
[18:44:36] <lalia> arryana: how's your day so far? :)
[18:44:46] <arryana> all solid, you?
[18:44:59] <lalia> Need coffee... but good otherwise. :3
[18:45:15] <arryana> tea would not go amiss
[18:46:14] <lalia> ThePhilosopher: sounds rewarding. Mountain homes are a lot of work but they're super peaceful places too, right? :)
[18:46:31] <DunceCotus> voltage_ drawing more nude teens
[18:48:09] <lalia> I might take the fam up behind Park City so we can hang out near some lakes and in the cool mountain trees.
[18:48:16] <lalia> Supposed to be hot again today.
[18:48:22] <arryana> oooh
[18:48:33] <arryana> it's due to be hot here too, i'm glad to be going home soon
[18:49:06] <lalia> <3 Texas heat can get pretty gnarly too, huh.
[18:49:25] <lalia> I guess it's been in the mid-to-high 90s here tho, so not much better. :D
[18:49:31] <arryana> lord
[18:49:44] <arryana> fortunately, home is something close to 70f
[18:50:14] *** Parts: l554 (~l554@172.58.229.179) ()
[18:50:27] <lalia> Very nice. :) That's some weather I can groove with.
[18:50:57] <DunceCotus> talking about weather
[18:51:15] <pussipupu> It's been killing hot here, but we had a nice couple of thunderstorms this aftternoon, so much nicer now
[18:51:22] <pussipupu> Though I regret leaving laundry out :þ
[18:52:00] <pussipupu> 28°C ish, which according to Google is about 82°F
[18:52:55] <arryana> there were thunderstorms here an hour ago
[18:53:26] <pussipupu> Lovely, Ukko and Akka the father and mother gods clearly still love us
[18:53:31] *** Quits: choozy (~quassel@75-63-174-82.ftth.glasoperator.nl) (Quit: https://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[18:53:37] <arryana> woohoo!
[18:53:42] <pussipupu> And love each other, given the traditional interpretation of what they're doing when there's a thunderstorm :D
[18:53:47] <ThePhilosopher> Definitely rewarding lalia. Living on a mountainside with a homestead with livestock and crops to take care of is a lot of work. But being able to have peace, bountiful organic food, and beautiful scenery in a nice small community is very rewarding.
[18:54:05] <arryana> i love the negative ion rush of a good storm
[18:54:32] <ThePhilosopher> I think it is around 90F and very humid today.
[18:54:51] <pussipupu> Delicious nutritious ozone
[18:55:00] <arryana> you must have a lot of people living there if you can take eight hours of a summer day to be inside
[18:55:39] <ThePhilosopher> ?
[18:56:24] <arryana> i've lived on homesteads.  it's a full time job, and indoor stuff is for winter.
[18:57:30] <ThePhilosopher> It's a small 5 acre homestead. Nothing big, or fancy. We are outside taking care of stuff between me and my wife for about 3 hours a day.
[18:57:51] <ThePhilosopher> Spread out throughout the day.
[18:57:59] <arryana> ah, so you are not fully subsisting, you buy food
[18:59:36] <ThePhilosopher> Not yet, we are working our way up to being fully self sustaining. We increased production by 50% this year, but it is still not enough. Since we are on a mountainside with a lot of rocky soil raised beds are expensive with lumber prices exploding. We try to grow as much as we can, but we choose to buy our meats from local organic farmers that we
[18:59:37] <ThePhilosopher> have built relationships with.
[19:00:02] <pussipupu> Acre is about half a hectare?
[19:00:26] <pussipupu> Ah 0,4ha
[19:01:13] <ThePhilosopher> Right now we have eliminated eating processed foods and only eat organic meats and produce.
[19:01:24] <ThePhilosopher> We don't like to raise our own livestock for eating.
[19:01:40] <ThePhilosopher> Right now we have a small flock of chickens and are debating getting a couple cows and goats.
[19:01:52] <ThePhilosopher> So we can have our own milk products.
[19:02:01] <arryana> eating them is pretty much what makes them livestock
[19:02:06] <pussipupu> I'd like chickens, but wouldn't  like having to kill them
[19:02:06] <arryana> otherwise they're pets
[19:02:08] <ThePhilosopher> Eggs.
[19:02:16] <ThePhilosopher> Delicious eggs.
[19:02:19] <lalia> I've discovered there's not enough grounds.
[19:02:24] <lalia> I must replenish.
[19:02:29] <arryana> haha
[19:02:50] <DunceCotus> thunda (na na na na na na na na) thunda
[19:02:50] <arryana> okay, so you're eating their increase. still food.
[19:03:27] <DunceCotus> ThePhilosopher Eggsalient
[19:03:43] <ThePhilosopher> Honestly our chickens make the best tasting eggs I have ever had in my life. They have an organic soy-free layer feed diet with leftover veggies from the dinner table. Combined with free range around the property.
[19:04:07] <DunceCotus> sounds like BIAS
[19:04:10] <lalia> Gonna read some Mouse Guard comics over breakfast. Awesome artwork and narrative arc. I love the games they've designed for the setting too.
[19:04:15] <ThePhilosopher> I really love the variety of colors too since we have different breeds. It's like easter every day with the blues, greens, browns, and pinks.
[19:04:18] <pussipupu> Just don't let them at the berry bushes, they'll empty them in moments
[19:04:55] <ThePhilosopher> It may be bias, but then again everyone that I have gifted eggs to agreed with me.
[19:05:09] <ThePhilosopher> Maybe they were being nice, or honest. I'll never know.
[19:05:11] <[itchyjunk]> You're feeding left over cooked stuff to the chicken?
[19:05:11] <voltage_> ThePhilosopher, variety of colors of what?
[19:05:17] <ThePhilosopher> Egg colors.
[19:05:36] <voltage_> they lay blue and green eggs?
[19:05:39] <voltage_> wtf :O
[19:05:45] <ThePhilosopher> Yup.
[19:05:47] <[itchyjunk]> voltage_, different species of chickens
[19:05:50] <ThePhilosopher> Easter eggers
[19:05:54] <[itchyjunk]> have different coloration of eggs
[19:06:01] <voltage_> never seen blue nor green eggs
[19:06:08] <[itchyjunk]> you see one or 2 color mostly because they are best for commercial farming
[19:06:18] <[itchyjunk]> voltage_, pretty common in homested
[19:06:24] <lalia> They tend to only sell bleached or brown eggs in stores.
[19:06:27] <[itchyjunk]> some chickens lay eggs once a day and some 3 a day
[19:06:47] <pussipupu> Bleached? O.o
[19:06:47] <ThePhilosopher> We have 8 different species of chickens I think.
[19:06:57] <ThePhilosopher> Yeah, chickens don't really lay white eggs.
[19:07:03] <lalia> Yeah, white eggs are often the result of bleaching.
[19:07:08] <ThePhilosopher> Not that I have seen at least.
[19:07:09] <lalia> Not pleasant, but truff.
[19:07:15] <lalia> troof*
[19:07:20] <pussipupu> Well, that's not good
[19:07:27] <[itchyjunk]> white leghorn chickens lay white eggs.
[19:07:33] <[itchyjunk]> Eggs aren't generally bleached.
[19:07:41] <[itchyjunk]> they are cleaned and such though.
[19:07:50] <ThePhilosopher> Neither is the hormones, antibiotics, and soy filled feed they give them inside of a cage that they never leave their entire life.
[19:07:55] <pussipupu> I've got eggs straight from the nest that were white, so they certainly do
[19:08:04] <[itchyjunk]> "egg color depends on the breed of the chicken. For example, White Leghorn chickens lay white-shelled eggs, while Plymouth Rocks and Rhode Island Reds lay brown-shelled eggs"
[19:08:10] <ThePhilosopher> What breed of chicken were they?
[19:08:10] <[itchyjunk]> https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/white-vs-brown-eggs
[19:08:10] <ro-bot-o> [url] Brown vs White Eggs — Is There a Difference? | www.healthline.com
[19:08:14] <pussipupu> The cleaning of US eggs is part of why they aren't safe to store at room temperature AIUI
[19:08:19] <lalia> I guess they tend to use hydrogen peroxide for the process, but it's not a lot more pleasant, right?
[19:08:19] <[itchyjunk]> Soy in feed isn't automatically bad either.
[19:08:25] <[itchyjunk]> This is urban myth.
[19:08:31] <ThePhilosopher> I disagree.
[19:08:39] <[itchyjunk]> You can, all you like.
[19:08:40] <pussipupu> In this case it's rural myth :þ
[19:08:45] <ThePhilosopher> I definitely taste the difference.
[19:08:46] <[itchyjunk]> ah right
[19:08:48] <[itchyjunk]> rural myth.
[19:08:57] <[itchyjunk]> The composition of egg doesn't change much.
[19:09:04] <[itchyjunk]> You still need viable offspring.
[19:09:14] <[itchyjunk]> Humans eating mc donalds don't produce different babies
[19:09:14] <DunceCotus> Eggstreme Egg-washing
[19:09:24] <[itchyjunk]> compared to someone on some organic diet.
[19:09:28] <ThePhilosopher> We dont wash the eggs until they are ready to eat.
[19:09:46] <ThePhilosopher> Last a lot longer that way.
[19:10:23] <ThePhilosopher> Definitely need to start selling them soon though. Way too many eggs daily. Can't keep up.
[19:10:31] <ThePhilosopher> I think I got 30 yesterday.
[19:10:44] <ThePhilosopher> 1 broody chicken refused to get off of one of the nests.
[19:10:45] <voltage_> the blue/green egg must be some american thing
[19:11:03] <[itchyjunk]> Why american?
[19:11:10] <[itchyjunk]> it is popular in homestead USA.
[19:11:17] <ThePhilosopher> Not really. There are some american easter eggers, but there are chicken breeds from around the world who lay them too.
[19:11:20] <[itchyjunk]> but i think you can get those species anywhere at this point.
[19:11:25] <DunceCotus> BLUE GREEN EGG THING
[19:11:41] <ThePhilosopher> They tend to be smaller and slightly more delicious.
[19:11:55] <ThePhilosopher> I definitely prefer my easter eggers over the others.
[19:12:40] <ThePhilosopher> Although as far as chicken breeds go. They are more difficult to take care of.
[19:12:55] <ThePhilosopher> Very squirrely and spazzy.
[19:13:08] <DunceCotus> Yeastier eggs
[19:13:15] <ThePhilosopher> Compared to the barred rocks, or buff orpingtons which are super easy to care for.
[19:13:53] <lalia> Werd. Time to check in on Discord then get started cleaning house and making breakfast.
[19:13:57] <lalia> Take care fam o/
[19:14:07] <ThePhilosopher> Have a great day lalia.
[19:14:50] <DunceCotus> I like tomboy girls with dicks
[19:15:13] <ThePhilosopher> We have to separate the flock soon into 2 flocks. Apparently the other chickens are not fond of the easter eggers, because they are smaller and have started pulling out their feathers.
[19:15:51] <ThePhilosopher> My best guess is that they are jealous of their pretty blue and green eggs. But that is just a theory lol.
[19:15:53] <voltage_> DunceCotus, wtf dude that's inappropriate
[19:15:58] <voltage_> stop being a weirdo
[19:16:20] <DunceCotus> voltage_ its just as on-topic as egg colours
[19:16:37] <voltage_> DunceCotus, oh right, true that man, i guess
[19:16:44] <voltage_> carry on then
[19:16:46] <ThePhilosopher> 0_o
[19:16:48] <pussipupu> Go well, lalia

[19:28:46] <lalia> Gonna check out the Teaching episode of Hotel Bar Sessions today.
[19:29:04] <ThePhilosopher> What is that?

[19:29:31] <ro-bot-o> [url] 13. Teaching - Hotel Bar Podcast | hotelbarpodcast.com
[19:30:13] <lalia> A podcast with three professional philosophy people discussing contemporary topics in a setting meant to capture the feeling of chatting over drinks after a philosophy conference.
[19:30:16] <pussipupu> My next one is apparently on the topic of art
[19:30:20] <ThePhilosopher> What kind of podcast is it?
[19:30:30] <pussipupu> It'll be a few days before I get to it though
[19:31:14] <lalia> ThePhilosopher: hopefully my last sentence helps some. :) Shannon is one of the best educators I've ever known, so it'll be great to hear her takes from this episode especially, IMO.
[19:31:48] <ThePhilosopher> Sorry, didn't see it. I have the chat tiled in half screen mode.
[19:31:51] <pussipupu> I wonder if they push the bounds of data throughput
[19:31:54] * pussipupu giggles
[19:31:56] <ThePhilosopher> Have to scroll up now lol
[19:32:19] <ThePhilosopher> Sounds interesting, I will have to check it out when I have some spare time.
[19:32:29] <ThePhilosopher> **Bookmarked**
[19:33:46] <voltage_> is it on youtube
[19:34:34] <lalia> I don't think so, sadly. I'd really like that and have asked about it. Very little to report back.
[19:34:49] <lalia> I'll keep bugging the hosts tho, I think a YT channel is smart.
[19:35:12] <ThePhilosopher> I don't blame them. YT is very censorship and demonitization happy these days.
[19:35:35] <ThePhilosopher> Also they will manually unsubscribe your audience if they don't like what you say and feel you are gaining too much popularity.
[19:35:36] <lalia> Ah! I'm wrong. They have the audio up at least: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8qDWEJF3VNjb7GjD_4ROQ

[21:43:53] <ThePhilosopher> One day I may learn CAD.
[21:44:05] <ThePhilosopher> It would certainly help me design all the inventions I have in my head.
[21:44:17] <ThePhilosopher> A little scared to learn it and don't know why.

[22:03:11] <DunceCotus> voltage_ sun is white
[22:03:25] <DunceCotus> has been for at least 8 years now
[22:03:33] <voltage_> no the sun is blue
[22:03:50] <DunceCotus> now I can't speak for your experience
[22:04:01] <DunceCotus> but I can safely say sun is white

[22:07:58] <DunceCotus> im not talking about sun as plasma
[22:08:00] <ThePhilosopher> I dunno. Looks kind of purple to me.
[22:08:19] <DunceCotus> Purpall
[22:08:44] <ThePhilosopher> With white spots.
[22:09:32] <DunceCotus> can someone shoot me so I don't have to go to work today
[22:09:56] <ThePhilosopher> With what. I have several calibers and objects to choose from.
[22:10:08] <ThePhilosopher> Gotta be specific.
[22:10:21] <ThePhilosopher> Also where do you want to get shot. I am not down for murder at this time.
[22:11:04] <DunceCotus> just in the arm will do

[22:14:04] <ThePhilosopher> Then may I suggest a 45 ACP, or 308 win. The holes will be significantly bigger, but if you are looking for maximum physical therapy with the best shot of going clean through. Then those two are better choices.
[22:14:34] <DunceCotus> alright, you're the expert
[22:14:47] <ThePhilosopher> Glad to help. ***BANG***

[22:33:16] <lalia> Over my years of hanging out in this channel I've seen activity fluctuate quite a bit. It isn't unusual for 24-48 hours to pass with perfect silence, even when the user count is above 200. We've only rarely been a very busy community in my experience.
[22:33:26] <lalia> It's great to see it in active moments tho. :)
[22:36:13] <ThePhilosopher> I am just surprised there aren't more people out there who like to chat about philosophy.
[22:48:38] <lalia> There are. :) IRC hasn't been much of a magnet for philosophy discussion for a decade or two, sadly.
[22:49:38] <pussipupu> IRC is great for chat, but I find it limited for more in-depth conversation
[22:50:07] <lalia> The majority of active philosophy participation online I run into can be found on forums for popular podcasts and academic mailing lists, TBH
[22:50:39] <lalia> There aren't many places to chat about it consistently unless you're happy to get into student communities like those on Discord (which also means tollerating Discord).
[22:50:42] <pussipupu> I think fora and mailing lists make more sense because of the longer form
[22:51:13] <lalia> Yeah, it works great and the professionals who participate are a lot more comfortable with the technology too.
[22:51:20] <lalia> So it's easier to get them participating.
[22:51:31] <pussipupu> I suspect if it could be moderated well(and liberally) a combination of IRC/Matrix/whatever channels and longer-form fora of some sort would work well
[22:51:48] <pussipupu> But also I suspect that i have to work for a living and can't dedicate the time to try to set such a thing up :þ
[22:52:20] <lalia> Matrix has the potential for handling a lot of what's left to be desired from OG IRC, this seems correct.
[22:52:40] <lalia> Pleased to see the progress over the years. :3
[22:52:46] <pussipupu> Yeah, I have my issues with Matrix, but it pushes at some of the right boudaries here
[22:53:14] <pussipupu> pretend I wrote boundaries >.>
[22:53:23] <ThePhilosopher> Not sure I ever used matrix.
[22:53:29] <ThePhilosopher> What is the differences between it and irc?

[22:57:41] <pussipupu> I mostly use Matrix at the moment to connect to IRC channels because Android is terrible
[22:58:08] <pussipupu> But assuming it improves in the promised ways, I wouldn't be against moving more over to it, especially if the network diversifies

[23:02:46] <lalia> So, yes. Channels like this one, in fact.
