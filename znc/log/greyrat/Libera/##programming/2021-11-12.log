[00:05:00] <pyzozord> pulse: ooh cool

[00:05:15] <pyzozord> "avoid heap memory allocations" so true. I don't like heap at all

[00:05:32] <jeaye> I wrote C++ for several years and would choose it over C, if I had to, any day. I've also shipped a few products in Rust and would choose it over C++ any day, for the same reasons I'd choose C++ over C. So, ultimately, when doing systems programming, I end up writing Rust. :)
[00:05:33] <pulse> It's a really long document on how to develop mission critical stuff
[00:05:46] <pyzozord> pulse: as far as I can see those guidelines are "keep it extremly simpe!!!"
[00:05:53] <pyzozord> and that I really like
[00:05:59] <pyzozord> it's not strict for me
[00:06:00] <pulse> pyzozord, Yes, simplicity is absurdly important in mission critical
[00:06:03] <pyzozord> it's sane
[00:06:10] <jeaye> Bust most the time I just write Clojure, since that's truly easy and simple.
[00:06:11] <pulse> You can't reason about stuff easily when it's covered in 100s of layers of abstraction

[01:59:56] <flakland> javascript invented popup messages, so yeah.
[02:00:19] <flakland> they should have known since that day
[02:00:52] <flakland> i mean who came up with that idea and why
[02:01:44] <flakland> how do you allow a system like that to thrive?
[02:02:02] <sonny> no clue
[02:02:18] <sonny> but, I wonder what it takes to make something else
[02:02:33] <flakland> some C code and a compiler
[02:03:10] <arahael> the gemini browser doesnt allow javascript and has other limitations for this reason.
[02:03:12] <sonny> I recall an alan kay talk were he said they messed up when making it, we could have a hyper media platform but simpler
[02:03:17] <CalimeroTeknik> it doesn't have to be C, ocaml is nice for making compilers
[02:03:22] <sonny> I just don't remember what he said
[02:03:40] <sonny> cross platform remember?
[02:04:08] <bugweiser> the browser was supposed to be wonderful that's why apple and ms joined force to kill netscape and attempto to postpone the future by a quarter century. Thats all..
[02:04:21] <sonny> wow
[02:04:37] <sonny> that's an insightful perspective
[02:04:43] <sonny> didn't know apple tried as well
[02:05:12] <sonny> scary thought is, it could have been one of their platforms instead. that would be terrible
[02:05:23] <bugweiser> both were in the os-market. Both their prime money-cows (at that point in time) was about to be reduced to something responsible to run a browser.

[02:06:05] <phogg> Apple didn't have much to say about it. At the time Microsoft was all about defending Windows as a platform and so they saw something which would create a non-Windows development platform as a threat.
[02:06:19] <sonny> bugweiser: I thought those are standard?
[02:06:31] <sonny> what's an example element?
[02:06:52] <pyzozord> god damn, Godel, Church and Turing where all 30 or younger when they came up with their stuff

[02:15:04] <sonny> minix is in a bad state, looks like they didn't know what to do

[02:15:56] <bugweiser> It had some good kicks for normal users, but that seens to halt to some grind around 2018  (indeed took the best bet for their project, bsd userland)

[05:08:16] <Guest39> plus most languages allow both
[05:08:30] <arahael> Guest39: wrong again.
[05:08:52] <Guest39> just set function to be immutable or something :)
[05:09:04] <arahael> Guest39: In Haskell, all functions are immutable. All values are immutable.
[05:09:10] <Guest39> so its a minus
[05:09:15] <arahael> A minus?

[05:09:30] <Guest39> a better approach would be a possibility to select mutability
[05:09:34] <arahael> Why?
[05:09:38] <Guest39> mutable or immutable
[05:09:45] <arahael> Why?
[05:09:57] <Guest39> it simply gives greater flexibility of expression
[05:10:06] <arahael> BY the contrary, it makes it harder to reason about the code.
[05:10:07] <Guest39> as you have said coding is a though
[05:10:24] <Guest39> perhaps harder for a certain type of thinking
[05:10:29] <arahael> Guest39: No, I said *language* is thought.

[05:11:00] <arahael> Guest39: There's no need to mutate things, in general, though.  All you want, is to map an input to an output, that's pretty much everything you need.
[05:11:34] <Guest39> maybe different people employ mostly functional or mostly object oriented approaches... Xd
[05:11:51] <Guest39> no need yes however the bigger the possibilities the more fun
[05:12:17] <arahael> Guest39: So, to get to your previous point, no, most langauges do not allow both.

[05:35:57] <arahael> Work with what?
[05:36:48] <arahael> But imho the way one usually codes into a corner is by either working around design flaws bugs without planning it proeprly, or making a design far more complex than it needs to be.
[05:37:06] <zzz> JanC: that's because "comparing languages for speed" is not really smething we can do. you can make the argument however that a language that compiles to C can never be faster than C, unless you count development time
[05:37:58] <flakland> it could generate more optimized code than C would
[05:38:09] <flakland> s/C/particular c-compiler/
[05:38:24] <JanC> well, in this case it was just the algorithm that was important (if you coded the version from Tim Peters in C it would have been even faster probably)
[05:40:44] <JanC> and some "languages that compile to C" might generate faster C code than most programmers (can) do

[06:45:44] <acaciause> it returns either 0x02 or 0 which are treated as true and false

[09:32:51] <CoJaBo> have I mentioend lately that i hate PHP coders <_<
[09:33:12] <[itchyjunk]> no
[09:33:20] <[itchyjunk]> last time you were hating someone else
[09:33:33] <CoJaBo> Probably someone who was a PHP'er tho
[09:33:48] <CoJaBo> So apparently, tons of our code compares numbers with corrupted numeric strings, which breaks in PHP8 :/
[09:33:48] <aoei\Chickatrice> hey don't hate the coder, hate the lang
[09:33:54] <CoJaBo> I hate both
[09:34:02] <aoei\Chickatrice> also hate is a bit strong
[09:34:19] <aoei\Chickatrice> chan topic says 'be respectful and friendly, full rules at: bla'
[09:34:32] <CoJaBo> Hot, seething hatred is indeed the feeling I feel lol
[09:34:35] <aoei\Chickatrice> i dunno if its all that respectful and friendly to be goin around hating on things
[09:34:55] <CoJaBo> One does not become a programmer, without hating most things.

[19:09:38] <Guest39> that is what been said - claim that there is no deviation - bug deviation Xd

[21:21:20] <pulse> I suppose

[21:50:02] <[itchyjunk]> oh interesting

[21:50:06] <oldlaptop> (or close enough)

[21:50:27] <GeDaMo> Erlang is similar to the original conception of object oriented programming: independent processes sending messages to each other
[21:50:34] <CalimeroTeknik> they make routers with it because it's extremely efficient as a model for routing, [itchyjunk]

[21:50:49] <oldlaptop> (Unless its foundational metaphor is its founder's sharp-elbowed and strongly opinionated style (apologies if I'm confusing the fellow with someone else))
[21:50:53] <apotheon> It's not a very popular basis for programming language design, as far as I'm aware.
[21:50:55] <CalimeroTeknik> apotheon, rather it's easy to spawn tasks, right?
[21:50:55] <[itchyjunk]> are each router to be though of as an agent?
[21:51:15] <CalimeroTeknik> no, incoming packets trigger new tasks
[21:51:21] <CalimeroTeknik> which end when the packet has been handled I guess
[21:51:36] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[21:51:43] <Guest52> I wish I was one of you guys. I wish I could learn.
[21:51:48] <CalimeroTeknik> if you are thinking in heavy OS threads, erlang would be like, spawning thousands of them per microsecond
[21:51:58] <apotheon> . . . so while Erlang could be used as a language in which to experiment with agent-based programming, just learning Erlang won't do it.
[21:52:05] <CalimeroTeknik> sure
[21:52:11] <[itchyjunk]> oh wait
[21:52:26] <CalimeroTeknik> for the paradigm you have to just think abstractly
[21:52:30] <[itchyjunk]> i thought number of threads are linkekd to a core. one core can spawn max 2 thread or something?
[21:52:40] <[itchyjunk]> i guess i don't really understand what threadding actually is

[21:53:03] <[itchyjunk]> ah threads are independent concepts then, maybe
[21:53:04] <jollygood2> 240 OS threads?

[21:53:14] <apotheon> I was trying to think of a lanaguage that would teach the agent-based model just by learning it.
[21:53:17] <GeDaMo> A thread is an execution context: instruction pointer, registers etc.
[21:53:17] <apotheon> I've got nothin'.
[21:53:21] <CalimeroTeknik> ah, sure, CPU threads VS CPU coresâ€¦

[21:53:33] <oldlaptop> why so *few*?
[21:53:41] <CalimeroTeknik> jollygood2, I'm running a few dozen applications which each run threads
[21:53:55] <[itchyjunk]> how many threads can a single cpu with 1 core run at the same time
[21:53:56] <[itchyjunk]> ?
[21:53:58] <jollygood2> I thought we are talking about single application
[21:54:05] <Inari> Where do I even see OS threads in windows
[21:54:05] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: 1
[21:54:10] <[itchyjunk]> ah..
[21:54:20] <GeDaMo> But it can switch between threads very quickly
[21:54:22] <oldlaptop> It can run an unbounded number of threads *concurrently*.
[21:54:23] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: 1 in parallel, no limit for concurrent threads
[21:54:26] <[itchyjunk]> so cpu just queues threads and does them one a t a time
[21:54:32] <oldlaptop> It can run one at any given time.
[21:54:38] <oldlaptop> Yes.
[21:54:43] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: The OS kernel does, not the CPU.
[21:54:54] <Decker> I kinda wanan make this agent playground sorta thing; but I don't know how to make it usable to others :) 
[21:55:09] <CalimeroTeknik> [itchyjunk], see CPU schedulers in kernels
[21:55:11] <[itchyjunk]> OS kernel does the queue, okay
[21:55:27] <Decker> I have many of the pieces to make what I think might work; but it's non 'standard' but then I don't know of a 'standard' 
[21:55:47] <[itchyjunk]> so if i have 1 task to do and i have 1 core, threading the task doesn't add any value?
[21:55:49] <apotheon> I imagine Firefox might use a lot of threads.
[21:55:51] <oldlaptop> Generally, either threads themselves decide when they will transfer control to other threads (or to the operating system, commonly), or (more commonly) the operating system will interrupt them forcibly, usually at fixed time intervals.
[21:56:19] <bugweiser> ^
[21:56:22] <Guest52> OSes with threads is nothing much magic
[21:56:27] <oldlaptop> Threading the task may make logical sense for the specific task you want to solve apart from parallelism concerns.
[21:56:30] <Guest52> *but magic
[21:56:47] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: it might if one or more threads is waiting on e.g. I/O

[23:43:57] <vdamewood> Decker: They're on eBay (without Visual Studio) for about $10 or $20.
[23:44:20] <[itchyjunk]> need help with this sentence
[23:44:22] <[itchyjunk]> "The state an object holds is always private to that object. "
[23:44:31] <[itchyjunk]> so a state is just a refrence to another object
[23:44:45] <[itchyjunk]> so why can other objects also have refrence to this first object and change it
[23:44:46] <bookwyrm> no
[23:44:49] *** Quits: INeedAHandle (~INeedAHan@user/ineedahandle) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzzâ€¦)
[23:44:59] <bookwyrm> objects encapsulate state
[23:45:11] <[itchyjunk]> "Hold state (references to other objects)."
[23:45:12] <vdamewood> bookwyrm: Enable it?
[23:45:19] <Decker> uhmm that's not really true
[23:45:29] <[itchyjunk]> it says hold state means just refrence to other objects
[23:45:35] <bookwyrm> that's why you have methods to work on the object itself
[23:45:45] <Decker> that needs more context... because you can inherit and things can use that state
[23:45:53] <[itchyjunk]> :(
[23:45:59] <Decker> 'state' is a bunch of things in one area.... 
[23:46:07] <Decker> it's the data of the object
[23:46:09] <bookwyrm> vdamewood: right click on the chm, there will be an option in the permissions window iirc
[23:46:22] <bookwyrm> I don't remember how I did it
[23:46:24] <Decker> and if you say public:  then it's not private
[23:46:32] <[itchyjunk]> state of the object is all the value it's fields has taken i suppose
[23:46:38] <Decker> yes
[23:46:38] <bookwyrm> ya
[23:46:43] <[itchyjunk]> oh okay, i'll take it with a grain of salt then
[23:47:38] <bookwyrm> when I read about singularity, my best takeway was that we've done nothing for 20 years lol
[23:47:41] <mrig> oh and events are as structural as matter.

[23:48:08] <bookwyrm> but it has great ideas for osdev, and it uses objects in a way that makes sense
[23:48:16] <[itchyjunk]> so the idea is if object b wants to change the state of object a, i pass the refrence of object a to object b then object b can call methods of object a to change its state
[23:48:42] <[itchyjunk]> singularity here means solutions of GR that's degenerate?
[23:48:51] <bookwyrm> well, that's what getters and setters are for?
[23:49:01] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: thanks
[23:49:03] <bookwyrm> [itchyjunk]: nah, it's an OS by microsoft research
[23:49:09] <[itchyjunk]> oh..
[23:49:14] *** Joins: rickybob (rickybob@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/rickybob)
[23:49:16] <apotheon> Where'd you find that number?
[23:49:24] <[itchyjunk]> well b can change it's own state via b.setBlah()
[23:49:30] <[itchyjunk]> but if a wants to change state of b
[23:49:43] <[itchyjunk]> a need to be made aware of existence of b first right?
[23:49:55] <bookwyrm> yeah
[23:49:56] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Quit: pulse)
[23:50:01] <vdamewood> swensson: CreateCommand returns an SshCommand object. You have to execute the command and read its OutputStream member.
[23:50:05] <[itchyjunk]> a "passes messages" to b by knowing about the refrence to b first?
[23:50:31] <vdamewood> swensson: Do you have the documentation CHM file for SSH.Net handy?
[23:50:36] <bookwyrm> I think so
[23:50:38] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i think i kinda get it
[23:51:32] <[itchyjunk]> so GameControl would track when a tower shoots at an enemy, then game control passes a message along to GameState that the enemy's health should decrease, GameState updates this stuff and tells GameView to draw the updated things
[23:51:33] <vdamewood> bookwyrm: Not sure what your problem was, but it doesn't look like it was the same as mine. I had to copy the CHM from my HGFS share to my desktop to view it.
[23:51:46] <vdamewood> (and there are no permissions on HFFS shares)
[23:51:54] <[itchyjunk]> i guess i don't know if GameControl and GameView talk to each other directly or not

[23:57:47] <swensson> vdamewood: Thank you kind person.
[23:59:15] <mrig> I think this is actually an obvious conclusion to draw from relativity, but not at all intuitive when coming from a western philosophical background, will be interesting to model.
[23:59:39] <mrig> computers are truly awesome for this.
