[04:56:18] <artao> that would be horrible
[04:56:27] <morlog> mink oils will probably ruin it 
[04:56:37] <morlog> they make leather softer
[04:56:39] <artao> i can always buy a new head
[04:56:52] <morlog> also, its rawhide, not treated leather
[04:57:35] <morlog> take some really fine grit sandpaper and lightly sand it to resurface it then rube your hands on the drum head
[04:57:55] <artao> ah, fair point
[04:58:02] <morlog> not dirty but not freshly washed
[04:58:09] <artao> it's really more for stuff like boots and shoes and baseball mitts

[04:58:31] <morlog> yeah, mink oil is for cured leather
[04:58:32] <artao> it definitely needs a wash
[04:58:41] <artao> i can use this awesome high end paint brush soap i have
[04:58:45] <morlog> just use a dry rag, thats enough
[04:58:53] <artao> no no no. it's dirty
[04:58:58] <artao> grimy even

[04:59:32] <artao> splooge on it and rub it in real good
[04:59:40] <macrobat> linseed is bad for stuff you will touch. dries to a sticky gunk where dust settles
[04:59:53] <artao> to a hard film eventually
[05:00:37] <morlog> spray painting the drum head also works for resurfacing but has mixed results for the sound quality
[05:00:42] <artao> walnut oil too
[05:00:57] <artao> you can mostly substitute walnut oil for linseed in oil painting
[05:01:02] <morlog> sometimes it makes them sound awesome, sometimes not so great
