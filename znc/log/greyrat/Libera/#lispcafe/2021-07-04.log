[04:47:12] <gilberth> I found the MOP LaTeX sources. On common-lisp.net, which is embarrassing in a way.
[04:47:19] <hayley> What would a mostly scientific way of measuring mutator CPU usage be? I am currently thinking to set a bit when we enter GC and clear when we leave, and periodically clear when we leave. Then another thread would record either the times for transitions or a full log.
[04:48:33] <gilberth> Use your scope!
[04:48:43] <hayley> Then we would use that to compute a minimum mutator utilisation graph.
[04:49:09] <hayley> Funny, my desktop does not have any GPIO. And if I rent out server hardware with userspace MMU hooks, then I'm not recording that either.
[04:49:19] <gilberth> You could toggle a pin on the printer port or the serial port.
[04:49:32] <hayley> Also, what happens if I return from a SIGSEGV handler? Does it try to run the instruction again?
[04:49:49] <gilberth> The printer port makes for pretty good GPIO. It's bidirectional most of the time even.
[04:50:29] <gilberth> hayley: Sure.
[04:50:56] <hayley> I heard it is UB generally on POSIX but Linux lets you do it?
[04:51:41] <gilberth> I would pretty much guess so.
[04:52:17] <hayley> I heard you can "portably" continue using libsigsegv but I can't find documentation on it.
[04:52:21] <gilberth> IDE also is just part of the ISA bus. And then there is the speaker. Plenty of options for GPIO.
[04:54:20] <hayley> I guess my experiment should go STW serial Immix -> STW parallel Immix -> concurrent-sans-evacuation parallel Immix -> fully concurrent w. read barriers parallel Immix
[04:56:06] <hayley> The nice thing is that it's basically mark-sweep unless it needs to defragment.
[04:56:29] <hayley> Can they put a button on the university library site that says "View GC handbook"? That is the only reason I use it.
[05:01:02] <gilberth> You don't have a copy? And they have it online?
[05:01:58] <hayley> Yep.
[05:03:04] <hayley> Excellent, the Handbook does have Immix in "Other partitioned schemes"
[05:03:28] <hayley> And damn G1 as well. /me never read Chapter 10
[05:06:03] <gilberth> That handbook is on my reading list, unfortunately my copy sits on a shelf at the evil house.
[05:06:33] <gilberth> Anyhow, returning from SIGSEGV/SIGBUS works for both Linux and Macos.
[05:06:42] <hayley> Nice.
[05:07:17] <hayley> Do you have any interesting programs in your Lisp-in-C interpreter?
[05:09:16] <gilberth> https://termbin.com/yk9e  <- SIGSEGV test
[05:09:41] <gilberth> hayley: No, I don't have any interesting programs.
[05:10:11] <gilberth> Didn't work. :(
[05:10:41] <hayley> Works here.
[05:11:12] <gilberth> My own IRC client inserted an NBSP and took it as part of the URL. :(
[05:11:14] * hayley guessed the IP of the Pi and pressed C-c just after the MOTD was printed out
[05:11:40] <hayley> Also works on the Pi, no surprise I suppose.
[05:12:27] <gilberth> That is good news. However the address mmap()ed is just a guess, could as well fail.
[05:13:08] <hayley> Appears that the Handbook is also unaware of JIT, saying that static analysis of shared or thread-local objects can break if you can load classes at runtime.
[05:14:57] <gilberth> hayley: You could try one of the Gabriel benchmarks. Should be easy enough to get them working with my toy lisp.
[05:15:55] <hayley> Ah, yeah. Off the top of your head, do any do mutation? Non-compacting runs would need a write barrier, compacting would need read and write.
[05:16:01] <gilberth> Reminds me, that I should write a kind of spec for toy lisp. Another version has 1/2 of CLtL1 written in it.
[05:16:47] <gilberth> hayley: No. All I remember is that some were stated as being GC benchmarks.
[05:17:07] <hayley> That said, I'm not sure whether to use the MMU or make the compiler insert write barriers. Those would be rarer, and doing stuff page-by-page works fine for read barriers for copying as you fix up everything anyway.
[05:17:17] <gilberth> hayley: There also is lisp500.

[05:30:58] <hayley> Thanks!
[05:36:54] <hayley> Are all assignments going through rplaca/rplacd here? If so making a write barrier would be damn easy.
[05:37:25] <gilberth> They do.
[05:37:34] <hayley> NEAT!
[05:39:16] <gilberth> I first Greenspun a little and once the data types are set, all other code should use that API. But: There are those control stack frames for CATCH/THROW.
[05:41:02] <hayley> Those live on the stack so I think we are safe. 
[05:41:40] <gilberth> Let me check, if this is the version where environments also live on the stack.
[05:43:05] <gilberth> No, environments are consed. If you wish I find the other much faster / less consing version, which allocates environments on the stack and copies them on demand, that is when closed over.
[05:43:17] <hayley> The more consing, the merrier.
[05:43:32] <gilberth> Heh, nice.
[05:44:04] <gilberth> Do we have some more coffee?
[05:44:55] * hayley does not know how to measure the mutator utilization of Boehm still. Perhaps assume that we are in GC in GC_malloc and any explicit GC call and that we are not otherwise? That wouldn't handle write barriers still.
[05:48:04] <hayley> And I guess I have to include the MPS as another mostly-copying mostly-precise GC.
[05:50:14] <gilberth> hayley: Thanks for the coffee.
[05:51:57] <hayley> I suppose a MMU (the GC meaning, I cannot be bugged to write minimum mutator utiliz--oh shit not again) would also be hard to get for MPS. Guess I have something to go off if I just record MMU for my own collectors.
[05:55:07] <hayley> Forgive my ignorance, but for anything larger than a page what is my best bet at allocation? Not that your Lisp has anything larger than a CONS IIRC.
[05:57:21] <gilberth> This is the old version where even closures are cons cells, and I have no strings. On purpose.
[05:58:31] <gilberth> The only thing larger is symbol names.
[06:00:03] <hayley> Okay, still not larger than a page though.
[06:00:52] <gilberth> There is struct symbol_more though, which I kinda regret now.
[06:02:47] <gilberth> I could have made these into struct node too. That is: put (<value> <name> . <plist>) on a more slot. So that everything is just a struct node.
[06:03:34] <hayley> Yes, I admit I am not looking forward to handling those. I would inline it into struct node but then every object will be larger. Unless there's some careful way to allocate the exact size?
[06:05:21] <hayley> Or I could put a type tag on symbol_more and pray that the padding ends up the same, which is likely IIRC.
[06:06:18] <gilberth> Milady, my initial idea was to make every node the same size. Just a type plus two pointers. Hence my suggestion to say struct node { ... union { struct struct symbol { T function, more; } .. } and have, as I said more pointing to (<value> <name> . <plist>); Name could be a either a list of code points or a new T_STRING node with just a char*.

[06:23:12] <hayley> Strings too now. Fancy.
[06:23:34] <gilberth> Only for symbols, no SUBRs for them. And I could add a length.

[06:25:54] <gilberth> makunbound, fmakunbound
[06:26:56] <gilberth> No, makunbdound also uses rplaca.
[06:27:19] <hayley> Seems I can't escape having a string type on the heap though. But I could hypothetically have my own GC_strdup allocate the string as a tagged object, then return a pointer to the string part. Then scanning a symbol with string S requires scanning the object at S - offsetof(node, string)?
[06:28:30] <gilberth> It's already tagged as T_STRING :-)
[06:28:56] <gilberth> Should I make the symbol name into a list of code points? To be really low-level?
[06:29:01] <hayley> Right, right.
[06:29:17] <hayley> My change would be to make char *string; into char[0] string; so that the string is inline I guess.
[06:30:24] <gilberth> Would that be any easier? I mean: then objects are of variable size. You could just malloc/free the names. And there are no real GENSYMs IIRC.
[06:31:00] <hayley> Yes, a real GC would handle variable size objects, and freeing is hard when you are trying to keep roughly O(live).
[06:33:39] <gilberth> Well, MAKE-SYMBOL (subr_make_symbol) already takes a list of code points, could as well make symbol name be just that. Won't hurt performance much.

[07:53:53] <hayley> Though I do want to inline the write barriers for rplaca and rplacd.
[07:55:56] <gilberth> Sure. GCC could do that. I pretty much depend on that. E.g. I also use eq() instead of ==. There is ENCAPSULATE_NODE to enforce that T is a struct and thus can't be handled as a pointer.

[09:39:19] <hayley> The definition in mps-noise.c is, well, MPS noise, but there shouldn't be one in ulisp.c

[10:06:29] <hayley> Dammit, Ravenbrook added ARM64 support a month ago. Guess I still had it before it was cool.
[10:09:12] <gilberth> hayley: I spot this do{ }while (mps_commit(...)); there.
[10:09:26] <hayley> Yes, it is asynchronous and so you have to do two phase commit.
[10:10:14] <gilberth> Would passing data to init an object with as the GC API entry point help?
[10:10:48] <hayley> Perhaps, but you could also just set everything to NULL without breaking the MPS.
[10:12:10] <gilberth> Then I don't see the point of this do{}while loop. And: NULL might not be NULL as /me also wants to play with tagging schemes. Especially using NaNs for pointers.
[10:12:46] <hayley> I think the aim is that you initialize it properly and save some bogus writes.
[10:16:10] <gilberth> ok. So an API wants to have an initial value.
[10:19:05] <hayley> Probably yes.
[10:20:32] <hayley> So Boehm had 744k page faults, malloc had 549k minor page faults, and the MPS had 1912.
[10:22:51] <hayley> The MPS thinks the benchmark needs 9MB of memory, Boehm 2.5MB and malloc 2.2GB.
[10:26:01] <hayley> Though if I do a parallel GC, it'd have thread-local allocation buffers and would only enter GC after the object is initialized, so no loop would be needed.

[12:20:13] <hayley> To handle interior pointers we have one bitmap with the starts of objects. Then we have another for marking. Either takes one bit per eight bytes, so a 1/32 overhead so far. Then to reuse lines we end up computing free bits per 128 bytes, which is pretty small.

[16:45:58] <Alfr> Good morning.
[16:46:25] <gilberth> hayley: How would it recompile my pointers?
[16:47:27] <gilberth> Or Virtual Box, or Parallels, but the latter is Macos, which also doesn't let me mmap negative addresses.
[16:47:31] <hayley> gilberth: It couldn't fix up your register and stack, so it is conservative there. But if the heap is precise then we update that concurrently, with a read barrier if the mutator gets to a page quicker.
[16:47:39] <hayley> Oh, right, emulation.
[16:48:10] <hayley> I don't know, but it could do whatever. It has to handle emulated memory mapped IO too, right?
[16:48:31] <gilberth> Well, that is easy.
[16:49:51] <gilberth> But: People would complain when their Linux in a virtual PC would all of a sudden run slow.
[16:51:11] <gilberth> And I bet I have spotted negative addresses with an %fs prefix in Go too. I don't even know how to set up segments. And as Google does not work anymore, I didn't find anything => Use the source.
[16:52:27] <gilberth> Aren't segments back to what they once were? An offset to add to addresses?
[16:52:56] <gilberth> I'll figure out.

[16:54:16] <gilberth> It can't be too obvious though since otherwise JS would use that.
[16:56:42] <gilberth> Or they just don't want to play any MMU tricks to be pretty portable and being hurt by random libc changes.
[16:57:18] <gilberth> Heck, even when using aligment traps, you better don't forget to switch those off, when entering libc.
[17:00:10] <hayley> In a paper, would you rather call the minimum mutator utilisation or the memory management unit the MMU?
[17:08:36] <gilberth> The latter.
[17:10:52] <hayley> Looking up "gc mmu" suggests the former is more common though

[17:22:07] <gilberth> I haven't read many GC papers recently.
[17:24:20] <hayley> beach asked twice what's wrong with the SICL design. I mean, nothing, but I want to test this one out.
[17:25:11] <gilberth> Ok. The rest of ulisp compiles with just <https://termbin.com/3sij> Good. It was planed that way.
[17:27:25] <gilberth> But I'd really would like to have my own stack, at least as an option. I wonder, if some pre-processor could do that for me.
[17:29:09] <gilberth> It doesn't need to be a full C parser, It would only need to recognize arguments and lexical variables. And I could well live with everything in just one file.
[17:29:47] <hayley> Hmm...
[17:30:24] <hayley> LLVM has a crappy shadow stack so you can implement a GC. Post process the IR so that it has the shadow stack and rooting calls enabled?
[17:31:00] <gilberth> Sounds easy. Not.

[17:35:39] <gilberth> I mean: Recognize any local variable. Alter the function body into { sp += n; /* clear, if you wish */ #define x sp[0] #define y sp[1] .... #undef x #undef y done: sp -= n; return res; } And make return x into do{ res = x; goto done; }while(0) shouldn't be too hard.
[17:37:35] <hayley> So there is the answer. Also, freeing can happen concurrently with both copying and fixing up the heap, not that it matters.
[17:38:04] <gilberth> Do the same for function arguments. make T foo (T x, T y) into #define foo(x,y) ( *++sp = x, *++sp = y, real_foo () )
[17:41:22] <gilberth> Or rather have linked frames on the stack, so that GCC still could have things in registers until the next transfer to another function.
[17:42:24] <hayley> In irrelevant news, I suppose my ex didn't listen to me unless it was necessary.
[17:43:05] <gilberth> Necessary?
[17:43:13] <hayley> She already heard about what that person did to me, then she decided I was too grumpy when I said they were an asshole.

[18:09:34] <hayley> Something like that.

[18:09:56] <shka> oh
[18:10:30] <shka> that's kinda bad
[18:10:36] <hayley> I did this in my shitty Sketchpad once. Have another thread repeatedly send a redraw event and have the handler redraw.
[18:10:38] <gilberth> I mean, does McCLIM have proper double buffering yet? I doubt.
[18:10:46] <shka> i don't think it does
[18:10:59] <shka> but it was a WIP, irc?
[18:11:00] <gilberth> hayley: Yep, that's the way to go.

[18:13:41] <gilberth> With my CLIM, I would just queue a redraw and/or modify the dirty region. Then in the repaint handler queue another. It'll syncronize to your refresh rate under Macos. Can't synchronize in X11 though. There is nothing in X11 to do that.
[18:14:45] <gilberth> So with X11 it would synchronize to the drawing speed, but with double buffer. BTW it is a real pity that the otherwise very nice double buffering extension in X11 is broken.
[18:14:53] <pl> gilberth: NaNs for pointers are source of many bugs in Mozilla's JavaScript
[18:15:01] <pl> not sure if V8 does it the same way
[18:15:26] <shka> ok, so i can't do smooth animation of points sliding around the map
[18:15:40] <gilberth> pl: Well, only because they have bugs, does not imply that I would have those too.
[18:16:12] <pl> gilberth: I'm pretty sure X11 the protocol has the necessary stuff, it's the XFree86/X.Org's lowest common denominator code that can't do that
[18:16:37] <gilberth> shka: Well hayley pointed you the way. Have a thread triggering repaints every so often and make the repaint handler then read the wall clock to compute the new position.
[18:16:44] <hayley> Funny, my UI did fairly smooth animation of points under gravity and spring forces.
[18:17:14] <shka> gilberth: that's what i will do
[18:17:27] <shka> but boy, this will look so dated
[18:17:28] <gilberth> pl: Yes, that would be news to me. I have not yet found anything that would do vsync'ed buffer flips and "interrupt" me.
[18:18:24] <gilberth> Aside from OpenGL that is.
[18:19:36] <gilberth> And GLX doesn't really mix with the rest of X11.
[18:21:20] <gilberth> pl: Anyhow, the double buffering extension is almost there. It's only that the shitty implementation resizes the backbuffer each time the window is resized, which is really slow and not how you would do that, you'd rather have one single back buffer the size of the screen and be set.
[18:22:43] <gilberth> I have seen attempts in McCLIM, which would allocate a back buffer pixmap per window^Wsheet and this won't work. I have a back buffer per top level sheet, shared by [sub] sheets.
[18:23:20] <gilberth> But then my sheets are non-mirrored.
[18:25:00] <gilberth> And I resize with a damn hysteresis on top level sheet resizes.
[18:26:59] <gilberth> However I plan to invoke the trick Cocoa uses for scrolling: It would keep a back buffer for a scrolled paned a bit larger than the viewport, so that on small scrolls the redraw is just a bitblt. The repaint handler then is called ahead to render parts not yet visible for when the user scrolls further.
[18:28:24] <gilberth> It's all a question of proper buffer handling.
[18:28:46] <gilberth> Damn, I can't hack all at once. :(

[19:00:22] <gilberth> Most simple demo. You're welcome.
[19:00:28] <shka> yes
[19:00:31] <gilberth> Should work with McCLIM too.
[19:00:31] <shka> pretty simple
[19:01:46] <gilberth> What I really love with CL is that you could hack the repaint handler while the animation is running.
[19:03:23] <shka> yeah, i know
[19:05:34] <gilberth> It is embarrassing to see how slow I type. :(
[19:06:10] <shka> it is ok, ma
[19:06:11] <shka> n
[19:10:13] <gilberth> Unless someone managed to break McCLIM, it should merge queued repaint events in case the timer loop overruns actual repaint speed.

[20:03:01] <gilberth> shka: The display lists behind output recording streams.
[20:03:44] <gilberth> As in an interactor the interactor has to remember the output done. This is the output record [history].
[20:04:27] <shka> hmmm
[20:04:35] <gilberth> Here the FOO pane is an APPLICATION-PANE, which records drawing to it, so that it could repaint itself.

[20:05:23] <shka> gilberth: thanks for the the code
[20:05:26] <gilberth> DOIT is not the repaint handler. But just draws something and then in a loop moves the one output record with the two circles in it.
