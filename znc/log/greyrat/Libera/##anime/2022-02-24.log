[12:45:41] <amigojapan> beaky: we have had no potatoes since December
[12:45:49] <mixfix41> potatoes are over abundance so they throw them out it cant reach markets in the conditions the supply chain is in

[12:46:56] <mixfix41> risky to try to be creative with a crop that could kill you if something goes wrong

[12:48:36] <mixfix41> doesnt it?
[12:49:06] <Nanobot> Back when Coco's graduation was announced, I could have sworn I made some joke about how someone from 5th gen left, and then someone from 4th gen, so clearly someone from 3rd gen would be next. But I can't find it in my logs. :(
[12:49:21] <mixfix41> or your saying japans potatoes
[12:49:25] <mixfix41> maybe so
[12:49:28] <mixfix41> im guessing
[12:49:41] <amigojapan> Nanobot: I take your word for it
[12:49:52] <emmeka> so our largest potato growing region here had a few cases discovered of a very contagious disease of potatoes. most countries subsequently closed their borders to our potatoes for the time being.
[12:50:02] <amigojapan> mixfix41: most potatoes are imported here
[12:50:11] <emmeka> this had a bit of a ripple effect on the global market, Canada is a huuuuuge potato producer
[12:51:00] <amigojapan> emmeka: since December?
[12:51:20] <emmeka> on Nov 21, apparently.
[12:51:27] <amigojapan> Ah
[12:51:54] <emmeka> your potato woes can be traced back to the humble bright red mud of Prince Edward Island
[12:52:28] <emmeka> go complain to Anne of Green Gables
[12:53:37] <mixfix41> buy my hens to get more eggs i bet a lot of eggs are being bought as we speak than potatoes cheese compliments it better
[12:53:41] <mixfix41> more*
[12:53:49] <emmeka> amigojapan but for example we export a lot of potatoes and seed potato to the US, which then lost those imports, so their own market got tighter, so they exported less, so on so forth

[15:17:40] <DPA> If russia and china keep expanding, however slowly, and nobody pushes them back, the only possible result is that they will eventually have taken over the world.
[15:17:43] <Sapphirus> Seems the article has changed from earlier
[15:17:46] <Sapphirus> but it said "While some member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, NATO as an organization is not, and it will not launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner but has no prospect of joining."
[15:18:22] <Sapphirus> Only thing they are doing is beefing up security in countries apart of the alliance
[15:19:18] <Sapphirus> now says "While some of NATO’s 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, NATO as an organization isn’t. It won’t launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner but has no prospect of joining."
[15:19:30] <Sapphirus> Which is the same thing, I guess.

[16:18:34] <analoq> even the eu countries bordering ukraine wont have a problem
[16:18:46] <analoq> there is no way they cross that border
[16:18:49] <Sadale> Probably. They're NATO members.
[16:18:58] <Sadale> a war on one means a war on all
[16:19:00] *** Quits: Berlin36 (~Berlin36@user/berlin36) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:19:35] <analoq> there will probably be lots of refugees though, but even that is fine imho. slavs are chill
[16:19:57] <analoq> even poland invited them, and that means something :P
[16:23:33] *** Joins: S4ll3n (~S4ll3n@154.6.21.97)
[16:23:41] <Sadale> Yeah Poland's rather reluctant to accept Middle East refugees that travelled via Belarus
[16:24:18] <isekaijin> ezekielnoob: Have you found any Astesia cosplayers? I'm having trouble finding good Astesia pictures, either 2D or 3D.
[16:24:52] <MootPoot> I doubt it
[16:24:54] <MootPoot> tbh
[16:25:11] <MootPoot> give it a while and they'll start being a hinderance too
[16:25:30] <MootPoot> although I expect more empathy for them from the europeans this time around since they all have a shared enemy
[16:25:39] <MootPoot> rather then refugees from some south asian war
[16:25:48] <analoq> Sadale: yeah maybe their idea is more "if we take the ukrainians, u take the syrians, eu? yes?" :P

[16:26:19] <Sadale> analoq, lol
[16:26:24] <analoq> MootPoot: not only that. we already have lots of russians/ukrainians here. it's not something new
[16:27:09] <S4ll3n> Putin should have done what China has done, spread soft power
[16:27:10] <Sadale> analoq, I dunno. I've a hunch that those middle east people are rather culturally different compared with the EU ones. So they may have greater difficult to integrate with the society there compared with Ukrainians
[16:27:32] <amigojapan> milkshake: since you got this one right, what is your next prediction?
[16:27:42] <davic> fled estonia in the correct time
[16:27:43] <davic> i guess
[16:28:06] <analoq> Sadale: yeah. even turkish people are significantly more problematic/ less integrated. not all ofc. but the whole religion issue is a big part of the problem
[16:28:20] <MootPoot> S4ll3n: cant do that if you dont have the money 
[16:28:23] <MootPoot> soft power is expensive
[16:28:50] <Sadale> yeah. The religion itself isn't a problem. But if you're living in a foreign country that the religion isn't prevalent, you can encounter quite a bit of problem, and could be causing problem as ewll.
[16:29:24] <Sadale> I actually couldn't believe that Russia would launch a full-scale invasion.
[16:29:25] <analoq> the whole women treatment thing is a big issue already.
[16:29:27] <S4ll3n> MootPoot, what I meant is building up soft power over the last 20 years
[16:29:42] <S4ll3n> Sadale I did
[16:29:45] <MootPoot> S4ll3n: yeah, cant do that if you dont have cash due to the embargos
[16:29:50] <Sadale> Russsia doesn't have as much population. And it has far less usable land.
[16:30:02] <Sadale> China has plenty of land that you can farm on. :3
[16:30:04] <S4ll3n> They did not have embargos 20 years ago
[16:30:15] <ezekielnoob> isekaijin ey... nope so far.. she kinda is rare
[16:30:19] <ezekielnoob> most common is Amiya
[16:30:20] <Sadale> Seriously tho it may be the right time to buy Russian stonks
[16:30:37] <Sadale> davic, How's PH? Met your gf yet? :3
[16:30:41] <amigojapan> S4ll3n: 20 years ago is just yesterday
[16:30:50] <milkshake> amigojapan: there will be some bombings in Moscow
[16:30:51] <MootPoot> S4ll3n: I dont think you have been following it much
[16:30:55] <analoq> theres a real possibility of russian companies not surviving
[16:31:09] <MootPoot> there have been plenty of embargos, just not the big news items ones
[16:31:16] <amigojapan> By whom milkshake 
[16:31:47] <Sadale> If they survive tho, the stonk price now is cheap.
[16:31:56] <MootPoot> lol Sadale 
[16:31:56] <MootPoot> stop
[16:32:03] <milkshake> amigojapan: idk perhaps some NATO intels
[16:32:04] <Sadale> Alternatively, buy BTC. It's droping real fast as well :3
[16:32:05] <analoq> Sadale: can you even buy them? or keep them?
[16:32:22] <analoq> the embargos may make them untradable, not sure what happens with your shares then
[16:32:28] <ezekielnoob> isekaijin AMiya kinda overlaps the role of aestesia right?
[16:32:32] <Sadale> analoq, There's a Russian indexfund available for trade that's listed in the stock market exchange here.
[16:32:39] <S4ll3n> Russia attacking is text book russian move, they did it to Hungry, Czechsolvakia and Afganistan
[16:32:53] <Sadale> analoq, you're right tho. The stock market there stopped working.
[16:32:56] <analoq> Sadale: well china probably wont give a fuck about embargos anyways
[16:33:10] <amigojapan> milkshake: that's too open to later interpretation, it's not a clear prediction 
[16:33:13] <Sadale> embargos against Russia?  lol probably
[16:33:16] <milkshake> amigojapan: i think Russia will get those territories in return of avoiding long war
[16:33:34] <amigojapan> milkshake: that is likely
[16:33:38] <Sadale> All countries are self-interested. China doesn't want another enemy. :P
[16:33:45] <analoq> Sadale: im not talking about the russian exchange, that one will keep working, but unaccessible to foreigners due to the embargos
[16:33:50] <milkshake> Ukraine has to lose them, thats the only option now
[16:33:54] <Sadale> analoq, oh
[16:34:01] <Sadale> analoq, true.
[16:34:05] <analoq> and the western exchanges may kick russian stock of the books
[16:34:11] <isekaijin> ezekielnoob: Well, if you unlock guard Amiya, then yes. Besides, after Surtr, you don't really need another arts guard that often.
[16:34:14] <analoq> and then ur fucked?
[16:34:24] <JesseDesu> i wanna see the F-22 in action
[16:34:30] <Sadale> analoq, you're actually right.
[16:34:32] <isekaijin> ezekielnoob: But Astesia is cuter!
[16:34:36] <Sadale> analoq, fine. I'll get BTC instead.
[16:34:43] <ezekielnoob> im gonna E2 her for you isekaijin
[16:34:46] <isekaijin> lol
[16:34:47] <S4ll3n> yeah, I'm just saying Russia could have been spending the last 20 years building up soft power, working with the US(same as China) instead of being abrasive
[16:34:54] <ezekielnoob> isekaijin lappland kinda got boring now
[16:35:03] <S4ll3n> the US does not have alot of F-22's
[16:35:08] <ezekielnoob> but she was my first mastered character.. well cause i had to do a photoshoot with her
[16:35:09] <S4ll3n> compaired to F-15's
[16:35:14] <S4ll3n> and 16's
[16:35:32] <isekaijin> Lappland is good. But there are too many enemies immune to her silence now.
[16:35:40] <JesseDesu> F-15s and 16s already have mig kills
[16:35:46] <Sadale> What if WW3 happens? What'd you guys do?
[16:35:59] <S4ll3n> probably would not notice
[16:36:00] <Sadale> The invasion went from 0 to 100 just in a day. wow.
[16:36:26] <ezekielnoob> nobody wants that
[16:36:31] <S4ll3n> Sadale not really, Russsia had been building up troops on the boarder for months/years
[16:36:41] <Sadale> hmm true
[16:36:42] <ezekielnoob> i think everyone would rather have Ukraine invaded than go to WW3
[16:36:54] <Sadale> hmm true
[16:36:57] <S4ll3n> and backing break away regions in the area
[16:37:20] <Sadale> S4ll3n, At first I thought that the Russian troops there was just there for a show. Like showing-off their force.
[16:37:20] <amigojapan> ezekielnoob: except Ukraine 
[16:37:31] <ezekielnoob> amigojapan ofcourse
[16:37:36] <S4ll3n> the big question was is putin bluffing or is he serious
[16:37:52] <ezekielnoob> S4ll3n i sure hope he just bluffing
[16:37:58] <Sadale> Actually even for Ukraine if they're given an option of getting annexed vs WW3, they might still pick getting annexed.
[16:38:07] <ezekielnoob> we don't want them trying to see of nuclear bombs work
[16:38:17] <isekaijin> ezekielnoob: He's already taken it too far for a mere bluff.
[16:38:22] <Sadale> Of course the best option is to stay independent from Russia and no WW3. But that option apparently is off the table :(
[16:38:42] <S4ll3n> simular thing happened with during the Arab-Iseali wars
[16:39:01] <Sadale> Anyway this world sucks. If I die off WW3, at least I wouldn't have to suffer in this world anymore. :-(
[16:39:08] <isekaijin> Sadale: what
[16:39:15] <isekaijin> Sadale: There's no 2D afterlife.
[16:39:18] <JesseDesu> i keep saying
[16:39:26] <JesseDesu> nuclear blast wouldnt be a bad way to go
[16:39:28] <S4ll3n> where Egypt was going "Training Excises" on the boarder with Isreal, then all of a sudden invades
[16:39:35] <S4ll3n> doing*
[16:39:53] <Sadale> Dunno. At this point if I have to rate my happiness in my life, I'd rate like 4/10.
[16:39:57] <isekaijin> S4ll3n: Then they promptly got pwned.
[16:40:06] <MootPoot> Sadale: just fap
[16:40:08] <amigojapan> Jesse nuclear fallout is now likely for many
[16:40:10] <Sadale> Only if I don't have to work and could do whatever I want without worrying about my lifehood
[16:40:12] <ezekielnoob> i mean
[16:40:15] <ezekielnoob> how will russia stop
[16:40:16] <S4ll3n> yeah, 
[16:40:26] <amigojapan> More likely*
[16:40:28] <JesseDesu> i live in a big city that will be target directly
[16:40:33] <Sadale> like fapping 24/7 without needing to worry about exhausting my savings
[16:40:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, ^
[16:40:57] <ezekielnoob> you think Russia can really take on europe?
[16:40:57] <S4ll3n> Isreali also did not have currption problems like ukraine does
[16:41:03] <isekaijin> Sadale: The good thing about the pandemic is that, if I work remotely, then I can fap during my breaks.
[16:41:12] <S4ll3n> and competant miliary leaders
[16:41:20] <Sadale> lol
[16:41:24] <Sadale> isekaijin, true
[16:41:25] <isekaijin> Before, it was “too much stress, let's buy coffee on the vending machine”.
[16:41:36] <isekaijin> Now it's “too much stress, let's fap”.
[16:41:39] <Sadale> I don't fap casually tho xD
[16:41:45] <isekaijin> lol
[16:41:55] <Sadale> I often use software and sex toys for fapping. xD
[16:41:56] <isekaijin> I see, you are a dedicated fapper who takes it seriously.
[16:42:11] <isekaijin> That is commendable.
[16:42:15] <isekaijin> I'm merely a casual.
[16:42:20] <MootPoot> Sadale: I mean, jokes aside - one of the biggest ways people live life and save more money is to get married / live with a partner
[16:42:27] <amigojapan> Why doesn't anyone feel shamed to talk about fapping?
[16:42:28] <isekaijin> Ok, enough shitposting.
[16:42:34] <isekaijin> amigojapan: It's just shitposting.
[16:42:34] <MootPoot> your imouto is gonna bail on you as soon as she's done her uni right?
[16:42:41] <MootPoot> amigojapan: why not?
[16:42:43] <MootPoot> FAP FOREVER
[16:43:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's a sign of low education
[16:43:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, I actually think that she'll be staying with me with high probability. Like 70-80%.
[16:43:33] <MootPoot> amigojapan: is it?
[16:43:36] <amigojapan> I mean by parents
[16:43:40] <MootPoot> lol
[16:43:47] <amigojapan> Yes
[16:43:49] <MootPoot> Sadale: are you two gonna pool money?
[16:43:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, If she's staying with me, I think so.
[16:44:08] <MootPoot> if sadale is in a relationship with his imouto then that means I cant move in with him in PH
[16:44:09] <MootPoot> :(
[16:44:15] <MootPoot> instead I'll live next door
[16:44:16] <MootPoot> and watch
[16:44:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, I also made it clear that I'll be staying with her. And I told her please inform me as soon as she wishes to leave me. And of course I'd do the same if I intend to leave her for whatever reason.

[16:46:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol
[16:47:32] <S4ll3n> I'm guessing the break away regions
[16:48:04] <S4ll3n> I don't think Russia want to get bogged down in a Guerilla war with Ukrainians
[16:48:48] <amigojapan> ezekielnoob: Russia also has disputed lands with Japan
[16:48:57] <S4ll3n> if they did, they would probably have to depend on money from China and have no way of really paying it back to the Chinese
[16:51:00] <Sadale> I actually find the debt-trap theory funny. I mean, the countries who borrow money from China ain't stupid. If there's indeed a debt-trap, why'd they take the loan offer?
[16:51:33] <MootPoot> Sadale: mixed bag
[16:51:45] <MootPoot> 1.) they dont really have a alternative, IMF is brutal
[16:51:53] <MootPoot> take it, then let the next president deal with it
[16:52:04] <MootPoot> 2.) china only funds projects that they would benefit from overseas
[16:52:15] <milkshake> ezekielnoob: just what they claimed belong to them, but attacking Kiev is something else lol
[16:52:27] <MootPoot> 3.) western anti china propoganda - somehow its bad if china debt traps them but its okay if the IMF does

[16:53:50] <amigojapan> milkshake: that is what we hear in IRC 
[16:53:58] <Sadale> In fact the west was far worse. The invaded and colonize places.

[16:54:45] <S4ll3n> Sadale its offen justified though
[16:54:55] <amigojapan> milkshake: that the entire Ukraine is invaded, but maybe IRC is wrong
[16:55:12] <analoq> how would a dept trap work between countries. if a country cant pay they just default on it
[16:55:32] <S4ll3n> Justified in a stragitic scense
[16:55:35] <Sadale> At least the entire Ukraine's getting bombarded. Not sure if the tropp's invading the entire Ukraine.
[16:55:40] <milkshake> amigojapan: no its real.

[16:56:05] <milkshake> just airspace invasion atht emoment, but the troops will start sweeping the streets
[16:56:06] <Sadale> Notice that it just said "Explosion". It didn't said group tropp invasion.
[16:56:26] <amigojapan> milkshake: did you verify it in a trustworthy news report?
[16:57:02] <analoq> yeah theres nothing on the russian state news about an invasion :O
[16:57:10] <milkshake> amigojapan: yes, just airspace invasion but they will get their troops foot on the streets
[16:57:35] <S4ll3n> so in logicly you would seize control of a such a rescourse, even though you have your own, before your adversary or potential adversay would
[16:57:44] <Sadale> It's just a "special millitary operation" :3

[16:59:04] <Sadale> If the western world thought that Russian would invade during the Olympic again, they're dead wrong! :P

[17:00:11] <amigojapan> Why do people not let pace be?
[17:00:25] <S4ll3n> mind you I'm guilty of calling people Nazi and Communists

[18:22:57] <analoq> then again, germany is pretty good at not lifting one either
[18:23:01] <Sadale> I'd rather to die sooner rather than later in case of WW3. Nuclear winter death would be painful af

[18:24:56] <Sadale> analoq, lol nope xD
[18:25:02] <Sadale> pokhu, no money.
[18:25:10] <pokhu> and that would change because of ww3 how?
[18:25:12] <Sadale> only if I could survive without a job. :'(
[18:25:25] <ButterNoodle> wdym
[18:25:27] <Sadale> If there's WW3, it probably means that I'll be dying very soon.
[18:25:34] <pokhu> ah so you have savings?
[18:25:43] <ButterNoodle> I have saved
[18:25:50] <ButterNoodle> jesus saved
[18:25:51] <analoq> Sadale: is there something like social security where you live? ive friends who havent worked since they finished university :P
[18:26:13] <milkshake> Sadale: dont die before having foursome with cute japanese cosplay girls
[18:26:30] <Sadale> analoq, AFAIK social security's only enough for the cheapest live style.
[18:26:32] <analoq> milkshake: threesome to easy? :,(
[18:26:51] <milkshake> analoq: threesome is for weakling
[18:27:02] <pokhu> what would you do with the money sadale
[18:27:57] <ButterNoodle> fivesome
[18:28:08] <DPA> I don't think nuclear winter will completely wipe out humanity. Also, it may solve climate change. But it would certainly suck to be alive during that time.
[18:28:08] <DPA> But I don't think everyone, or maybe even nobody, will make use of nukes. Maybe at most to nuke themself. After all, nukes mean the area becomes almost uninhabitable. So I think most will just opt for deadly but non-radiating weapons.
[18:28:36] <Jigsy> >After all, nukes mean the area becomes almost uninhabitable.
[18:28:38] <analoq> DPA: imho they are a perfect deterent for preventing attacks. all that will happen are proxy wars
[18:28:40] <milkshake> ButterNoodle: fivesome is for strong comrade like Ruski
[18:28:42] <Jigsy> Is that what happened to Detroit?
[18:29:16] <Sadale> My current plan is to save up money for retirement so that I could stop working by 2040 and live off with my savings for like 20 years. If I know that the world's ending in, says, 2025, I'd just stop working right now and use my savings right now
[18:29:16] <analoq> or in case of ukraine a direct confrontation on foreign land
[18:29:28] <Sadale> pokhu, For livehood.
[18:29:45] <Sadale> pokhu, for housing, utility, food, internet and computer. That's it.
[18:30:23] <Sadale> And I'll be living on the internet. Unfortunately living in the internet ain't free. I still need money to survive physically in order in live in the internet
[18:30:41] <analoq> so like the lowest living standard? :D
[18:31:35] <analoq> Sadale: social sec is 450eur here + paid rent 
[18:31:37] <Sadale> hmm. as low as I'm comfortable enough.
[18:31:52] <Sadale> analoq, lucky you. Let me check the social security here. Just so you know the tax rate here's rather low.
[18:31:56] <pokhu> hope you get lucky sadale
[18:32:14] <analoq> Sadale: well i doubt you beat our tax rate on food (7%)
[18:32:28] <analoq> which probably will be your biggest cost
[18:33:24] <analoq> or at least not beat it by much
[18:33:32] <Sadale> analoq, We get US$344 for a single-person family. Anyway you could get low-cost subsidized housing if you're real poor.
[18:33:45] <Sadale> analoq, no food tax here.

[19:57:21] <Sadale> yes?
[19:57:23] <MootPoot> Does it also run in a forever loop
[19:57:28] <Sadale> Yep.
[19:57:37] <MootPoot> Can it be event based 
[19:57:52] <Sadale> There're different archictectures. But the ones that I've worked with is inside a main loop.
[19:58:06] <MootPoot> I guess everything can be event based inside of a loop with the right logic structures
[19:58:38] <Sadale> yep. So you don't want your code to have any blocking delay.
[19:59:03] <Sadale> There's another archecture. That's with an RTOS/scheduler. But I've never used it seriously.
[19:59:22] <Sadale> With RTOS you can have multiple functions running "concurrently". Kind of.
[19:59:33] <ButterNoodle> I just had an event
[19:59:42] <ButterNoodle> in the inside of my front zipper pocket
[20:00:43] <Sadale> Oh. And here's something that's special for microcontrollers regardless if you're using RTOS or not. For microcontrollers there's something called "interrupt". The microcontroller would call a specific function/"routine" when am "interrupt" occurs. For example, if you setup a hardware timer and the hardware timer interrupt is triggered upon timeout, the microcontroller will pause the execution of the current code and jump to the interrupt handler immediately.

[22:00:02] <Nanobot> From listening to the other Hololive members who were in the know about the Russia situation, it sounds like they tried to work with Russia to resolve the situation privately, but Russia's bad decisions made it spiral out of control to the point where everyone's hands were kind of tied. When you think about the fact that Cover just fired their top-earning employee just after publicly defending her and just before a major event that will need to be largely 
[22:00:02] <Nanobot> overhauled now (which is expensive), it doesn't sound like something Cover would do if there wasn't a serious reason for it.
