[21:54:52] <nmz> StayHungry: whatcha doing?
[21:56:16] <StayHungry> nmz: exploring possibilities of Racket the language, perhaps the last on my list :)
[21:56:32] <nmz> oh? lisp?
[21:57:37] <nmz> have you seen rebol red-lang?
[21:57:47] <nmz> its lisp without ()
[21:58:48] <StayHungry> so far i'm struggling with quotes in Windows command-line :)
[21:59:11] <nmz> I hate quotes
[21:59:21] <nmz> I hate everything tbh
[21:59:56] <nmz> lua has the right idea with their [=[ or [[]] for strings, but then they ruin everything with a pascal syntax
[22:00:00] <StayHungry> because racket -e 'Hello, world!', racket -e "Hello, world!", racket -e "'Hello, world!'" -> does not work
[22:02:09] <nmz> shouldn't , be ;?
[22:04:40] <nmz> nope
[22:04:43] <nmz> batch is weird
[22:07:05] <StayHungry> racket -e "(display ""Hello, world!"")" works, finally
[22:07:32] <nmz> luajit -e "print'hey'" works
[22:07:36] <StayHungry> why did they make double quotes for commands... why not single ones.... aggrrh :D
[22:07:56] <nmz> they didn't
[22:08:05] <nmz> you are unquoting and quoting
[22:10:11] <nmz> don't use batch, try anything else
[22:10:17] <nmz> like powershell
[22:16:35] <StayHungry> powershell has a lot of quirks (e.g. https://github.com/nightroman/PowerShellTraps )
[22:17:20] <StayHungry> anyway, that quoting issue pops up the first time among recently reviewed languages
[22:17:42] <StayHungry> racket -e "(displayln (string-join (reverse (string-split ""23-07-1821"" ""-"")) ""-""))" -> 1821-07-23
[22:17:44] <StayHungry> hooray :)
[22:18:58] <nmz> just use rebol
[22:20:54] *** Quits: pyre (~pyre@crimeboss.nillas-power.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:23:58] <StayHungry> you mentioned lisp for a reason which i see now
[22:24:13] <StayHungry> every commands begins with (, never seen such before in scripting languages
[22:24:19] <nmz> (don't use it, theres a reason nobody does)
[22:24:37] <nmz> in scheme?
[22:24:43] <StayHungry> racket
[22:24:53] <nmz> do commands begin with ( ?
[22:25:00] <StayHungry> racket -e "(displaln ...

[22:25:23] <nmz> lisp syntax is based around order which is indicated via (
[22:25:40] <nmz> its completely unnecessary with a smarter parser
[22:25:40] <StayHungry> indeed, a new thing for my eyes :)
[22:25:52] <nmz> rebol is that smarter parser
[22:26:15] * StayHungry looks up 'rebol'
[22:26:42] <nmz> another language derived directly from lisp is forth

[22:33:26] <StayHungry> indeed, last version dates back 2011
[22:33:30] <nmz> it is dead
[22:33:39] <nmz> red-lang is its successor
[22:33:42] <StayHungry> aggrrh, why did you offer it then :D
[22:33:47] <siraben> forth isn't really dead, just not commonly used
[22:33:55] <nmz> never said forth is dead
[22:34:03] <siraben> ok no one in industry earnestly uses it
[22:34:15] <nmz> well... forth is dead
[22:34:20] <nmz> but forth is actually a zombie
[22:34:22] <nmz> its unkillable
[22:35:10] <nmz> its such a PITA to use
[22:36:01] <StayHungry> alright, updated the table with Racket ways https://dpaste.org/0eZd/slim
[22:36:40] <StayHungry> poor Lua, no way to do split/reverse/join out of the box 
[22:37:32] <StayHungry> Raku was a pleasant surprise this morning. Perl 6 as they call it, but syntax is far more clear than Perl's (5) one
[22:37:40] <nmz> StayHungry: why would you fault lua for that?
[22:37:44] <nmz> lua has no batteries
[22:37:51] <nmz> its meant to be that way
[22:38:05] <nmz> https://luapower.com/ here's your batteries
[22:38:32] <nmz> but you can do it by hand though
[22:38:36] <nmz> not that difficult
[22:38:45] <StayHungry> see limitations section in the header :D
[22:38:58] <StayHungry> by hand -> hardly a oneliner, too long
[22:39:10] <nmz> (displayln (string-join (reverse (string-split ""23-07-1821"" ""-"")) ""-"")) <- you want this in lua?
[22:39:26] <StayHungry> you see a way to do that in one-liner?
[22:39:56] <nmz> lua doesn't care about lines
[22:39:59] <nmz> its all whitespace
[22:40:18] <StayHungry> i mean something like that lua -e "print(('23-07-1821'):gsub('(%d*)-(%d*)-(%d*)', '%3-%2-%1'),'')"
[22:40:24] <StayHungry> a one-liner
[22:40:59] <StayHungry> to be used within command-line, in batch's pipes, etc
[22:41:47] <StayHungry> then i could finally remove all that monstrous msys2 package with more or less ported unix utils :)
[22:45:19] <nmz> ok so first, you can download stdlib, you could have $LUA_INIT to be a module you can load everytime you call lua, and you could remake reverse() and split()
[22:48:29] <StayHungry> yes, but... portability. it means every time i pass it to someone, i have to tell them - install that and then that. that's why i put 'no remote modules' in limitation section. but tell me about luajit, is it lua with a lot of modules that bar lua lacks, right?
[22:48:44] <StayHungry> *bare
[22:48:46] <nmz> luapower
[22:48:52] <nmz> luapower is lua with batteries
[22:49:05] <nmz> it uses luajit, which is lua's jit's interpreter
[22:50:34] <earnestly> That's not quite right
[22:51:05] <earnestly> luajit is a seperate project created by the excellent Mike Pall, and is possibly one of the finest jits around
[22:51:19] <nmz> lua5.1
[22:51:24] <earnestly> Although he has been absent since 5.1 pretty much
[22:51:33] <earnestly> So luajit isn't compatible with newer versions
[22:51:56] <earnestly> Maybe some sign of life: https://repo.or.cz/w/luajit-2.0.git
[22:53:00] <earnestly> And lua itself was always designed as an embedded such that libraries like python and co. doesn't make much sense
[22:53:17] <earnestly> But these days everyone wants everything to be the same as everything else regardless of design scope, *shrug*
[22:55:37] <StayHungry> i was reading a book about R this morning
[22:56:05] <StayHungry> and it strikes me (again) how perplexing some trivial things could be :) e.g. https://s3.rokket.space/t_fKnmdm.png
[22:56:58] <StayHungry> i mean, come on, using 'statistical regression' (what is it in the first place?) to explain what is object-orient programming is incomprehensible. give some visual example from ordinary life.
[22:57:16] <StayHungry> e.g. car consists of parts (engine, wheels, seats, etc). car is a big object, its properties include color, weight, mileage. each of its parts (little objects) also have properties.
[22:58:01] <StayHungry> it becomes obvious when you're more or less trained in humanities such as linguistics, basically when you learn(t) other natural languages outside of your family. to explain what is wabi-sabi (term from Japanese aesthetics) or toska (term from Russian 'soulful' world), you have to use palpable visuals rather then celestial  abstractions.
[22:59:25] <earnestly> You are like the memes
[22:59:55] <StayHungry> so i believe there's a room for improvement in the programming field. both in creating (at least scripting) languages that resemble how we, human, speak and think. not that [for tea, at nine to join me, 'feel free'] :D and in explaining them to others.
[23:00:25] <nmz> lua -e 'do local t={} for x in ("23-07-1821"):gmatch"[^-]+" do t[#t+1]=x end local x={} for i=#t,1,-1 do x[#x+1] = t[i] end print(table.concat(x,"-") ) end'
[23:00:29] <nmz> # lua -e 'do local t={} for x in ("23-07-1821"):gmatch"[^-]+" do t[#t+1]=x end local x={} for i=#t,1,-1 do x[#x+1] = t[i] end print(table.concat(x,"-") ) end'
[23:00:30] <shbot> nmz: bash: lua: command not found
[23:00:53] <nmz> you could simplify of course, make a split() and a reverse()
[23:10:53] <nmz> LUA_INIT="@$PWD/badstdlib.lua" lua -e 'print( table.concat( table.reverse( ("23-07-1821"):split"[^-]+" ), "-" ) )'
[23:11:06] <nmz> https://tpaste.us/KM5n
[23:11:13] <nmz> of course you could export LUA_INIT
[23:11:35] <nmz> ; lua -e 'print( table.concat( table.reverse( ("23-07-1821"):split"[^-]+" ), "-" ) )'
[23:11:37] <nmz> 1821-07-23
[23:11:39] <nmz> then its just that
[23:12:42] <StayHungry> damn, you're smart :)
[23:13:16] <nmz> (actually, I'm using this as a LUA_INIT from now on)
[23:13:29] <nmz> I just like lua
[23:14:01] <StayHungry> i recall a game from early 90s... called Populous. god-simulator where you build a world brick by brick :)
[23:14:14] <StayHungry> so do you right now, producing functions bare lua lacks 
[23:16:15] <StayHungry> i wonder how longer they keep pastes on https://tpaste.us/
[23:16:38] <StayHungry> *long
