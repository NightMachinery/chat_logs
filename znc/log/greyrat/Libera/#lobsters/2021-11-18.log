[01:21:27] <ngoldbaum> i hate hate hate nonuniform styles across a C codebase
[01:21:29] <feoh> Problem is you generally can't make changes to style like that without justifiably making people super cranky
[01:21:40] <ngoldbaum> which is way to easy to entropy into

[01:22:04] <feoh> Right
[01:22:22] <feoh> Everybody likes to hate on it but that's one really nice thing about Python's indentation decree. A lot of that goes out the window
[01:22:30] <ngoldbaum> feoh: i think go showed that having autoformatting is worth it, even if the formatting isn’t perfect for everyone at least the style is uniform and no arguments
[01:22:39] <feoh> and with wide acceptance of Black, the One True Python code formatter, all the rest of the style issues go out the window too :)
[01:22:44] <feoh> Exactly

[19:25:19] <bsandro> I certainly would not call that "cheating", because it is just another level of abstractions on the giant pile of abstractions we're using everyday anyway
[19:26:59] <bsandro> it is fun and often performant/effective to stay "closer" to the hardware but still just a feeling, it is not real, with modern cpus shuffling your handcrafted assembly code over internal pipelines, basically interpreting it with firmware inside of the cpu

[19:28:49] <bsandro> i'm not a big fan of GC though anyway, in my experience your time freed from "manually managing memory" is spent fighting the quirks of the insane GC
[19:29:51] <c355E3B> I feel like its easier to debug garbage collectors though.
[19:31:05] <bsandro> it is often comes down to going into the unknown territory, might be a substantial overhead
[19:32:19] <bsandro> caught a bug in nodejs GC back in the day, had to dive into v8 even though primary stack was js
[19:37:02] <ngoldbaum> i’m happy with GC languages except when program logic triggers a memory leak
[19:37:17] <bparker> not a fan of unpredictable latency either
[19:37:31] <ngoldbaum> in my experience most GC languages make it an enormous pain in the ass to even discover where the leak is happening, let alone how to fix it
[19:37:50] <varjag> i can't remember that ever happening
[19:37:54] <varjag> resource leaks, plenty
[19:38:03] <varjag> memory leaks, nope
[19:38:03] <ngoldbaum> happens a lot in python
[19:38:08] <varjag> well duh
[19:38:16] <varjag> what happens in python stays in python
[19:39:22] <ngoldbaum> i don’t think it’s a python problem, it’s more a sufficiently complicated data dependency structure which can be easy to trigger in a GC language if you’re not careful at the outset
[19:39:31] <indigo> In Python you have to grow GILls to swim through the sea of leaks
[19:39:50] <companion_cube> debugging GC leaks is hard, but so is debugging malloc leaks
[19:39:59] <companion_cube> and that happens more often for some kinds of programs :s
[19:40:37] <varjag> ngoldbaum: perhaps it is leaking via foreign dependencies
[19:40:42] <varjag> allocated c-strings and stuff
[19:40:56] <varjag> out of reach of normal gc
[19:41:11] <varjag> (python does not have a normal gc but bear with me)
[19:41:48] <varjag> since python is mostly a shell for calling into c and fortran that could well happen often
[19:44:28] <bparker> hopefully GIL will be gone soon
[19:44:40] <ngoldbaum> it can and that is a pain to fix
[19:45:24] <ngoldbaum> but also more prosaic stuff like sticking a reference to some object into a dict making unintentionally creating a cyclic data dependency 180 nodes long
[19:45:54] <ngoldbaum> and yeah, ideally stuff like this doesn’t happen
[19:46:22] <ngoldbaum> but also people write insane python all the time and sometimes you’re the guy who needs to come in afterwards to fix it
[19:49:53] <bsandro> go did it right imo giving so much control over GC because resorting to fine-tuning of it is a common thing (and doing silly things like allocating ton of memory at the start to cheat gc)
