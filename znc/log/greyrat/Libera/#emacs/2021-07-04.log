[02:46:58] <grym> so it's nice to see ... not that.

[02:49:26] <dale> I often feel like I write too much in commit messages.  That issue, for example, probably got at least two good editing passes where I just tried to be shorter and more clear.
[02:50:14] <dale> I'm trying to be aware of when the stuff I'm writing in a commit message should really go in a more persistent place, like a comment or Sphinx documentation or something.

[02:53:12] <libfud> if you're writing very big commit messages
[02:53:18] <libfud> you're probably doing too much with a commit
[02:53:20] <libfud> I'm guilty of this though
[02:53:52] <libfud> I try to follow a format of a short summary message followed by more explanation in a longer format when required
[02:53:57] <dale> Eh, sometimes it's a three paragraph description of a problem with a two line fix.
[02:54:13] <libfud> that does feel excessive

[02:55:34] <dale> libfud: I do agree, though, that it might be a symptom of needing to split your commit.  Or that you need to move it somewhere else.
[02:56:11] <dale> I try to think about "when will this information be most likely to get in my face at the right time".  Sometimes the answer is "when I'm running git blame and reading the commit that made this line".
[02:56:58] <libfud> personally I don't like the "I noticed this" sentence
[02:57:00] <dale> Though maybe I just read the commit that made a line because I know there's a good chance that I left a detailed explanation in the commit mesasge?

[02:57:58] <dale> libfud: Is that because you think it's unnecessary?  I find having potential reproduction instructions available to be helpful sometimes, which is why I think I wrote that.

[02:58:05] <libfud> I'd perhaps rephrase that as "this caused scrolling through a xxxx line long file to take yy seconds"
[02:58:44] <libfud> I mean you just say "a very long apache configuration file" without quantification
[02:58:52] <libfud> it gets the info across in any case
[02:58:59] <dale> In this particular case, I think it was important that it was an Apache config file.
[02:59:14] <dale> Or, at least, something that was going to have a lot of properties changing as you scrolled through it.

[07:20:45] <Wafficus> Is there a way to change the theme for the 'spaceline' package or do I have to hack up my own solution for this?
[07:21:15] <Wafficus> I ask because I tried out a few more themes, and realized the spaceline, and Helm itself were not changed unfortunately, so it was jarring to see the Spacemacs theme clash
[07:21:38] <Wafficus> ideally, I would love it if I could somehow get the "word perfect" theme to be uniform throughout, that's my goal

[08:37:19] <bpalmer> spacemacs is pretty big

[09:01:24] <technomancy> Wafficus71: C is 1970s technology. turns out we've learned a lot about programming language design since then.
[09:01:26] <libfud> memory management errors are a huge problem with C/C++
[09:01:45] <libfud> I do not like C. It is full of stupidity.
[09:01:56] <libfud> integer promotion is a huge pain
[09:01:56] <aidalgol> libfud: You'll love C++ then.
[09:02:10] <libfud> aidalgol: C++ is unironically much easier to deal with in many circumstances and aspects than C.
[09:02:17] <libfud> is it uglier? yes.
[09:02:19] <aidalgol> Actually, at least C++ has a standard library with bounds-checked data-structures.
[09:02:23] <libfud> is it *much* uglier? hell yes.
[09:02:29] <aidalgol> I mean, they're horribly ugly, but beats bare arrays.

[09:03:16] <libfud> (to a small degree)
[09:03:18] <Wafficus71> it seems like C++ is a pain because they keep updating the language, ex: its hard to keep up with
[09:03:21] <aidalgol> C++20 is also throwing in the kitchen sink, so it's not all good.
[09:03:23] <Wafficus71> to me I find that a bit annoying
[09:03:29] <libfud> C++20 has modules
[09:03:37] <aidalgol> libfud: Wait, really?  For real this time?
[09:03:40] <libfud> yes
[09:03:43] <aidalgol> Wafficus71: You don't have to keep up, though.
[09:03:46] <lampilelo> not implemented yet
[09:03:47] <Wafficus71> I'm a project kind of guy though, so I'll probably just fork an actual audio plugin if I actually decide to do it
[09:03:48] <libfud> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules
[09:03:59] <libfud> clang tooling for C++20 isn't up to speed
[09:04:08] <aidalgol> Hmm, I'll hold off on celebration until it's implemented.
[09:04:16] <Wafficus71> idk, the only programming project I was maybe gonna do was make an audio plugin, copy and modify an existing DOS game for fun, etc. Just cool stuff like that
[09:04:28] <libfud> aidalgol: you can use modules in c++20 in clang and gcc with a flag
[09:04:45] <Wafficus71> aidalgol so even if you wrote older module code, it wouldn't force you to be up-to-date?
[09:04:48] <libfud> C++20 feature set isn't all the way there for clang tooling so clang tidy can croak (personal experience)
[09:05:05] <Wafficus71> tot be fair, I ALMOST got through the C Programming Language 2nd edition book until the end. The end portion is nuts imo
[09:05:13] <aidalgol> Wafficus71: You specify which language standard to the compiler.
[09:05:17] <Wafficus71> Dennis Ritchie is a genius comparatively
[09:05:32] <libfud> C syntax is an abomination
[09:05:43] <Wafficus71> I kind of want to be like Jack Rusher where he writes in Clojure and just writes code that can be exported to different languages
[09:05:56] <aidalgol> libfud: Have you heard of The Most Vexing Parse?
[09:06:00] <libfud> C++ despite its warts does try to paper over some of the worse aspects of it
[09:06:00] <Wafficus71> saw that dude's Clojure conference vid on his Emacs setup, blew my mind the other day

[09:10:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They seem to all look exactly the same, so I'm suspecting there's a mode for it.

[09:11:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I kinda like Lisp-2. But regardless, what I mind a lot more than Lisp-1 vs Lisp-2 is lack of namespaces.

[12:40:40] <lisp123> How to isolate a hook to a major mode's buffers?
[12:41:01] <lisp123> e.g. (add-hook 'after-change-functions 'my-function) --> I only want it to work in buffers with the major mode active
[12:41:27] <wasamasa> add-hook has an argument to make the hook local to the buffer
[12:41:34] *** Joins: whk (uid469868@id-469868.tinside.irccloud.com)
[12:41:43] <wasamasa> so you can use the major mode hook to run a function to make it local to that major mode buffer
[12:41:57] <wasamasa> the easier alternative is to write a function that checks the major mode
[12:42:08] <lisp123> wasasmasa: thanks, let me do that
[12:42:14] <wasamasa> use the tab key for nicknames
[12:44:10] <lisp123> if a function is defined as buffer-local in a major mode - does it only apply to buffers that have that major mode?
[12:44:21] <lisp123> sorry if I'm being confusing as I'm still trying to connect all the dots
[12:45:45] <wasamasa> functions aren't buffer-local
[12:45:48] <wasamasa> they're global
[12:45:59] <wasamasa> variables can have buffer-local values
[12:46:01] <wasamasa> like a hook
[12:46:32] <wasamasa> experiment with add-hook and inspect the hook with F1 v
[12:46:41] <lisp123> so for the hook variable defined to be buffer local - if the "(add-hook ..)" is within the major mode's elisp file, does it apply only to buffers of that major mode?

[16:06:18] <wasamasa> sure

[20:02:39] <Wafficus> hey can someone help me talk through how to revert my 'life.org' notes to my commit from last night?
[20:02:46] <Wafficus> *via Magit
[20:03:15] <Wafficus> reason being is that I made some revisions this morning, and it forced me to merge, and my notes look terribly messed up. I just want to revert to last night's commit and just mark some stuff that I marked earlier as done
[20:03:55] <Wafficus> I have my cursor over the last night's commit but don't know how to delete the commits above it in 'l (character) l (character)' mode in Magit*
[20:04:27] <Wafficus> The commit number itself is: "9336a0a"
[20:04:33] <Wafficus> That I want to revert to*
[20:05:42] <wgreenhouse> Wafficus: because git is git, the term you're looking for is "reset"; "revert" means something else

[20:09:58] <Wafficus> got it
[20:10:05] <Wafficus> I used 'x' and reverted it to older branch
[20:10:09] <Wafficus> deleted life.org
[20:10:12] <Wafficus> pulled from the branch
[20:10:14] <Wafficus> and then we're good
[20:10:22] <Wafficus> thanks on this one. I suck at git so much with this
[20:10:52] <Wafficus> after I recoup from this, I'm deleting that git repo personally and just using rsync since I hate how it inserts "<HEAD>" comments when it merges two differences. In an org doc, its a nightmare as a result
[20:10:59] <Wafficus> thanks a ton
[20:11:06] <Wafficus> wgreenhouse gnoo
[20:13:06] <wgreenhouse> Wafficus: emacs has good tools to deal with those merge commits. typically on opening a file containing merge comments, the minor mode `smerge-mode` activates automatically and lets you choose

[22:19:09] <fpc> I have been using Emacs for quite sometime but haven't read a proper book or the manual. Just picked up what I need from googling and redditting. but I want to read a "proper" book once. if there are enough people interested, we can do it together.
[22:19:35] <Nyeogmi> thanks for the warm reception!
[22:20:05] <xristos> you're better off reading introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp, learning to use interactive help and finding information in the official manuals

[22:26:06] <lisp123> Given emacs functions are global, should I name all functions within my mode as modename-mode-function-name?

[22:34:52] <dale> lisp123: It's often the case that foo.el prefixes all its symbols with "foo-".  For example, built-in python.el prefixes (or should, at least) all its symbols with "python-".
[22:35:16] <lisp123> dale: thanks for that. I will re-name all my functions now :)
[22:35:52] <bremner> pretty sad that C has better namespacing than elisp
[22:36:14] <dale> There is probably some pragmatism necessary, as your literal example of "modename-mode-" being the prefix might be a bit long, even if your file is named modename-mode.el.
[22:37:16] <lisp123> dale: I know, but I'm trying to reduce my cognitive load when it comes to naming and reading functions, and be consistent throughout...although I've got some names now that are 5-6 words together!
[22:38:45] <lisp123> bremner: elisp is the first language I've worked with that makes it cool to define many things as globals :) It does definitely help when it comes to customising, however the CL package system wouldn't be a bad idea to adopt (although there isn't THAT much difference between the two if you prepend all your functions with modename-)
