[01:08:54] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@200.5.63.76)
[01:09:17] <aphysically> okay, it looks like my OS has custom vim syntax for various things installed in /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/syntax but nvim doesn't read that
[01:10:19] <mjlbach[m]> nvim wouldn't read that
[01:11:27] <aphysically> is there a way to get it to read it without suddenly not reading the main syntax files
[01:11:44] <aphysically> i see $VIMRUNTIME but presumably if i set that it will stop finding the main syntax files
[01:12:19] <aphysically> how is vim doing it?
[01:12:34] <mjlbach[m]> nvim isn't going to read vim syntax files, it ships its own
[01:12:41] <mjlbach[m]> (which are ported from vim)
[01:13:23] <aphysically> what I mean is, how is vim reading multiple vimruntimes
[01:14:02] <aphysically> I have various extra syntax files and stuff installed in this "vimfiles" directory that aren't part my my main vim install, yet vim is reading them as well as its own shipped syntax files
[01:14:22] <aphysically> I'd like to get neovim to read those syntax files too, but obvoiusly just overriding where it looks for syntax files won't work because it will break most of the syntax
[01:14:47] <aphysically> and I copy what vim does in neovim and point it to the correct directory? is there some other way to add an extra directory for where to look for syntax files without overriding the existing one/getting rid of it?
[01:15:41] <aphysically> or is this a removed nvim thing maybe(?)
[01:16:42] <mjlbach[m]> You can add syntax files in runtimepath somewhere
[01:16:51] <mjlbach[m]> I think it's ~/.local/share/nvim/syntax?
[01:17:32] <aphysically> it doesn't look like that's what vim is doing, I don't see anything in ~/.vim
[01:18:13] <mjlbach[m]> That's not what vim is doing
[01:18:34] <aphysically> oh did you figure it out?
[01:18:38] <mjlbach[m]> I'm saying you can copy/paste the missing syntax files into your userland neovim configuration
[01:18:40] <aphysically> do they hardcode looking in vimfiles or something?
[01:20:30] <mjlbach[m]> I think it checks any ./syntax folder on your runtimepath
[01:20:44] <aphysically> hmm it doesn't really work, I don't think you can symlink all directory contents
[01:21:20] <aphysically> mjlbach[m]: and vim allows setting multiple runtime paths? (but not nvim?)
[01:21:25] *** Quits: reumeth (~reumeth@user/reumeth) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[01:21:57] <aphysically> that seems like it would be the path of least resistance if it's possible (just add vimfiles to nvim's existing runtime path)
[01:22:15] <mjlbach[m]> vim and neovim allow you to append to rtp
[01:22:21] <mjlbach[m]> rtp += whatever (in vimscript
[01:22:22] <mjlbach[m]> * (in vimscript)
[01:22:57] <aphysically> oh, then let's do that?
[01:23:06] <aphysically> let's try
[01:26:28] <aphysically> can't seem to get it right, I'm trying set rtp += ",/usr/share/vim/vimfiles"
[01:28:20] <aphysically> maybe I need to add it before the existing rtp?
[01:30:17] <mjlbach[m]> :set rtp+=/usr/share/vim/vimfiles
[01:30:23] <mjlbach[m]> I probably wouldn't do that
[01:30:37] <aphysically> why is that
[01:31:18] <aphysically> it just contains syntax and such from system packages like tmux/gentoo, that sort of thing
[01:31:24] <aphysically> and nothing else as far as I can see
[01:32:37] <aphysically> it looks like it doesn't work anyway
[01:33:37] <aphysically> are they colon separated maybe?

[02:53:00] <aphysically> clason[m]: those files are all fine it's the separate directory my distro is installing syntax *not* from vim I was trying to add 
[02:53:45] <aphysically> my vim stuff is in /usr/share/vim/vim82, I was trying to get it to work with stuff from /usr/share/vim/vimfiles, which is where my distro throws syntax files provided by packages
[02:53:51] <aphysically> i.e. NOT from vim
[02:55:08] <aphysically> I don't necessarily think it's correct for nvim to automatically try to use it (nvim is not vim after all), but I'm not sure why my modifications to the runtimepath weren't helping (I gave up on it)
[02:55:52] <aphysically> the most relevant syntax missing from nvim because of this is the plugins/syntax for all my distro-specific files, but I'm gonna see if I can't just install that as a separate plugin
[02:55:57] <aphysically> (which I'll try whenever github is back online)
[02:56:32] <aphysically> that doesn't fix everything (I showed in the bpa.st link all the stuff it misses), but it's the only ones that are very annoying to not have so eh
[03:00:53] <aphysically> clason[m]: I tried printing out the runtimepath after I modified it and it was modifying it correctly so it must be something else that goes wrong
[03:01:07] <aphysically> I checked the vim runtimepath and it's indeed just adding /usr/share/vim/vimfiles
[03:01:34] <aphysically> (although I'm not sure if it's vim or my distribution that makes it add that)
[03:01:52] <clason[m]> yeah, I don't know why distro packages insist on messing with the default vim runtime path

[03:02:15] <clason[m]> my suggestion would be to look for the files you need, and put them in your user config directory (which is added to runtimepath by default)
[03:02:34] <aphysically> anyway it would have been *nice* to just pull in those files but this was mostly just something to do while github was down and I'm not gonna pull my hair out over it much more than I already have
[03:04:56] <aphysically> clason[m]: that's not the worst ;) gentoo modifies vim itself to forcefully modify your textwidth *after* your config is processed unless you set a gentoo-specific vimrc option to tell it not to
[03:05:03] <aphysically> It took me 7 months to figure this out

[03:12:15] <aphysically> oh!! I have an idea
[03:12:36] <aphysically> it worked :D - I can just add the directory as a vimplug package Plug '/usr/share/vim/vimfiles'

[07:24:12] <sapere_aude> Hello everyone! My nvim is not detecting some file types even though the file itself is in the same path of the `runtimepath`. Apparently this is only happening with ini config files. Running `:set ft?` returns nothing, I have to manually run `:setfiletype dosini` in order to have syntax highlighting. I have the file `dosini.vim` in 5 different
[07:24:13] <sapere_aude> directories, all listed in the `runtimepath`(e.g. /usr/share/nvim/runtime/ftplugin/dosini.vim).
[07:24:13] <sapere_aude> I've already tried changing plugins path (vim-plug), reinstalled with fresh config file, but nothing... have anyone one experienced something similar?

[08:08:23] <sapere_aude> gpanders Actually, reading the filetype.vim I saw the comment "Plain text files, needs to be far down to not override others. This avoids the "conf" type being used if there is a line starting with '#'. I was testing my polybar config file and it started with the ';' character. I've appended the '#' to the config file and after that the file got
[08:08:24] <sapere_aude> recognized a "conf".
[08:10:01] <sapere_aude> I've just found this answer in a  thread: "I have ; vim:set ft=dosini: at the end of my config files. In the future, polybar will support ~/.config/polybar/config.ini as a default config path, there vim will automatically set the right file type."

[14:59:35] <Yogen88[m]> Guys, finally I managed to make something that works: https://pastebin.com/kcFJKDm3 It turned out that all along my problem was trying to run it with :luafile %, while it only works if it is read as a lua module from the startup of nvim, it has something to do with vim.loop and libuv could someone please explain to me why?
[15:00:39] *** Joins: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav)

[15:04:41] <Yogen88[m]> in previous examples I was using vim.loop, is jobstart not based on that?
[15:05:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's your understanding of lua modules/tables, and how they're loaded/cached with `require`

[15:09:13] <Yogen88[m]> not yet, reading up
[15:12:29] <Yogen88[m]> So if the main difference is that they don't support modules, in theory I should be able to run a simple vim.loop example with :luafile right?

[18:15:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> also, I wonder how the same font/display looks across various operating systems

[22:45:06] <JulianJulianBerm> tree-sitter performance improvements aren't merged yet right? specifically I just re-tried my nasty tree sitter parser and I still get 5 second pauses when opening a file -- there was a ticket for merging query caching, is that the one I should be watching?
[22:46:32] <clason[m]> what "tree-sitter performance improvements"?
[22:47:27] <clason[m]> (it's an ongoing effort, but lack of developers makes it slow going)
[22:47:31] <JulianJulianBerm> there was a  specific one I'm trying to find that I think you told me about
[22:47:41] <JulianJulianBerm> yes of course! not rushing anything, just asking if there's anything recently I should keep an eye on
[22:47:59] <JulianJulianBerm> I see from profiling that I still spend like 91% of time on startup in `get_query`
[22:48:00] <clason[m]> not to my knowledge, unfortunately (see above)
[22:48:41] <clason[m]> we upgraded to tree-sitter 0.20.1 recently, but if anything, that seems to have made (some) things slower...
[22:49:58] <JulianJulianBerm> ok, I don't see it either, I thought the issue title was something about caching some intermediate representation of queries, but that doesn't find me anything relevant in either the neovim or nvim-treesitter repo, so maybe I'm misremembering entirely
[22:50:47] <clason[m]> Might have been an issue with a description of how to address this rather than an actual PR...

[22:57:18] <aphysically> I had originally assumed that was all in the upstream stuff like https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python but then I was confused when I saw changes being merged in the nvim-treesitter plugin too
[22:58:24] <clason[m]> roughly:
[22:58:25] <clason[m]> 1. tree-sitter is a C library that uses parsers (external libraries, also C) 
[22:58:25] <clason[m]> 2. Neovim bundles this library and exposes an API (as `vim.treesitter`)
[22:58:25] <clason[m]> 3. nvim-treesitter adds functions on top of that to (more) easily build and distribute parsers and queries

[23:00:11] <clason[m]> for each language, you need a parser to generate the syntax tree for a given buffer as well as queries that can be run against the syntax tree to do stuff -- like highlighting, indenting, and whatnot (the queries can be generic or very specific to the purpose; you're interested in different things for highlighting and for indenting)
[23:00:51] <clason[m]> basically, the parsers are external projects that are editor-agnostic (like the one you linked)
[23:01:05] <aphysically> and nvim-treesitter carries the queries?
[23:01:22] <clason[m]> the queries are (usually) more specific; there may be generic queries but you'd adapt/specialize them
[23:01:36] <clason[m]> yes, nvim-treesitter distributes the queries
[23:01:53] <aphysically> yeah that clears up my confusions then :)
[23:02:47] <clason[m]> it basically does three things:
[23:02:48] <clason[m]> 1. install (download and compile) parsers 
[23:02:48] <clason[m]> 2. install queries
[23:02:48] <clason[m]> 3. provide modules using those for, e.g., highlighting
[23:03:01] <clason[m]> (that should be explained in the nvim-treesitter Readme, by the way)
[23:03:28] <clason[m]> Long-term, parts of this will likely be upstreamed, but this way allows faster development 
[23:03:28] *** glider_ is now known as glider
[23:03:36] <clason[m]> (and some things will remain external)
[23:07:50] <aphysically> makes sense

[23:33:24] <Collider[m]> Hello, does anyone use ssh with git?
[23:35:23] *** Joins: mdrake (~mattd@2601:1c0:6c01:b460:1b72:680d:903d:2b7d)
[23:37:00] <bfredl> only git with ssh, sorry
[23:37:12] <Collider[m]> Literally what I asked
[23:37:24] <tar_xvf> it was a joke, but ok
[23:37:28] <tar_xvf> i do too, what about?
[23:37:40] <Collider[m]> I followed this guide: https://docs.codeberg.org/security/ssh-key/
[23:37:47] <Collider[m]> And the step 4 at `Generating an SSH key (pair)`
[23:37:57] <bfredl> you didn't ask anything, but ok :]
[23:37:59] <Collider[m]> >   You will be asked for a passphrase, enter one if you'd like to or leave the prompt empty.
[23:37:59] <Collider[m]> The private key part of your SSH key can be protected by a passphrase. This adds a layer of authentication which increases security. Be aware that this will only be helpful for certain attack scenarios and does not offer 100% protection. It is recommended to keep your private key safe and - well - private.
[23:38:15] <Collider[m]> That passphrase is for same-OS security, correct?
[23:38:36] <Collider[m]> No one can ssh without the private key, right?
[23:38:40] <clason[m]> not sure what this has to do with Neovim, but ok :]
[23:38:42] <Collider[m]> The passphrase shouldn't matter in this case
[23:38:50] <Collider[m]> clason[m]: neovim uses git, doesn't it?
[23:38:51] <Collider[m]> 😂
[23:38:53] <tar_xvf> if you enter a password there, then every time it uses the private key it will ask you to type in the password
[23:39:06] <clason[m]> but not ssh
[23:39:06] <bfredl> you can ssh without private key just fine.
[23:39:13] <Collider[m]> tar_xvf: Yeah but I don't want that.. just asking if it's still secure
[23:39:20] <Collider[m]> bfredl: Good good, thanks!

[23:39:57] <Collider[m]> I had it ENOUGH with `git push` and then having to open my password manager
[23:39:57] <Collider[m]> and type everything
[23:40:01] <tar_xvf> ah, i think you don't need a private key if you are accessing a public repo, like cloning. Is that right?
[23:40:17] <Collider[m]> tar_xvf: It's not right if you do `git push` xD
[23:40:27] <tar_xvf> oh yeah
[23:40:30] <bfredl> could be an issue with your keyring, you are only supposed to type it once per session
[23:40:42] <tar_xvf> I thought you needed a private key to authenticate you as the appropriate user?
[23:40:45] <Collider[m]> I don't want to type it at all, man
[23:40:51] <Collider[m]> tar_xvf: yes
[23:40:54] <Collider[m]> I have that
[23:40:57] <tar_xvf> ok

[23:41:16] <mjlbach[m]> I’m confused what the issue you are facing is
[23:41:33] <tar_xvf> you can leave the password blank and it won't stop and ask you to type it in. Keeping your private key should be plenty secure
[23:41:37] <Collider[m]> I was wondering if it's secure to not use a passphrase for which ssh-keygen asks 
[23:41:56] <tar_xvf> if you enter a password that's just basically your computer asking you permission to send the private key to authenticate yourself
[23:42:03] <Collider[m]> Yeah I am a big dummy so I get easily confused, thanks
[23:42:09] <tar_xvf> pretty sure it is safe to not use a password but am not a security exper
[23:42:11] <tar_xvf> t
[23:42:12] <leiserfg[m]> You can also use a credential helper 
[23:42:31] <sunjonSenghanBri> ...use a password.
[23:42:31] <Collider[m]> leiserfg[m]: Not documented enough, that can go fuck itself 👀
[23:42:37] <Collider[m]> * Not documented well enough, that

[23:42:59] <mjlbach[m]> Use a password
[23:42:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> and `# man ssh-agent`
[23:43:14] <mjlbach[m]> Just use ssh-agent with keypass or something
[23:43:15] <Collider[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: did that
[23:43:46] <Collider[m]> mjlbach[m]: > just
[23:43:46] <Collider[m]> It's not a "just" - it's more complexity :d
[23:44:40] <clason[m]> and more security
[23:44:44] <mjlbach[m]> What
[23:44:46] <clason[m]> can't have your cake and eat it
[23:45:19] <Collider[m]> mjlbach[m]: Why?
[23:45:30] <Collider[m]> I use keepassxc
[23:46:18] <bfredl> so maybe the support forum for keepassxc might help debug your issue? :)
[23:46:32] <Collider[m]> I have no issue
[23:46:46] <Collider[m]> mjlbach[m]: Asking about this
[23:47:20] <bfredl> yes, why not do that?
[23:47:23] <mjlbach[m]> I actually meant keychain
[23:47:28] <mjlbach[m]> My b
[23:47:34] <Collider[m]> bfredl: Because it's more complex
[23:47:43] <bfredl> so don't do that then.

[23:50:04] <Collider[m]> I am glad we settled this. Thanks guys
[23:50:29] <clason[m]> Happy we could help you with your topical question.
[23:50:42] <mjlbach[m]> Keychain is pretty nice, you enter your pass for a given ssh key once per session and it manages your ssh agent for you
[23:51:15] <Collider[m]> It probably keeps the key in the memory or something then, instead of in plain-text, huh?
[23:51:25] <Collider[m]> If that's the case - then it would be more secure
[23:55:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's _kind_ of on-topic, given that someone raised the security/plugins issue on reddit last week?
[23:57:01] <mjlbach[m]> That came up in the proposed questions for the core panel for the release stream lol

[23:57:31] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah
