[05:30:30] <Tosin> Does anyone know if an example exists where I can transcode a stream of an audio file rather producing a new file?
[05:31:03] <klaxa> you mean in-place editing? no
[05:32:17] <Tosin> Hmm that's unfortunate. I've been using the IStream interface and have the stream of audio and I just want to remove specific intervals in it

[06:01:58] <DeHackEd> it might be possible if you did your own file IO and just had ffmpeg write to a memory buffer internally, with you flushing it.
[06:02:06] <DeHackEd> doesn't sound very fun though
[06:05:48] <Tosin> I'm up for the challenge
[06:05:58] <Tosin> I did write the IO
[06:06:20] <Tosin> I just need to know where I might need to start looking for reference
[06:06:48] <Tosin> Like say I have a stream, and I just want to remove the first 10 seconds of the stream, that's what I need to figure out what to do

[20:37:39] <BtbN> FFmpeg is not C#, and I think it can't capture individual Win32-Windows anyway, only screen regions.
[20:38:56] <furq> gdigrab can do that but the performance isn't great
[20:40:21] <JEEB> if APIs are being utilized anyways one can just do similar things as OBS and do desktop duplication etc
[20:40:41] <JEEB> not sure how limited that is to a window handle, but should keep it on the GPU so things can then be done in shaders etc

[21:34:49] <Guest49> any c# developer who can help me in record video from a winform control
[21:35:54] <BtbN> I really don't think that's possible
[21:36:15] <BtbN> best you can do is grab the global position of your window, and then define a screen region for ffmpeg to capture
[21:36:25] <BtbN> FFmpeg has no idea about C# stuff
[21:37:11] <Guest49> ok.thanks bro...
[21:37:18] <kepstin> Ideally you'd have your controls render to a system memory buffer that you could give to ffmpeg directly, but I have no idea if that's even possible with winforms
[21:37:19] <Guest49> so you mean tweeking this command
[21:37:20] <Guest49> ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 24 -probesize 42M -i desktop -preset ultrafast -pix_fmt yuv420p camera1.mp4
[21:37:32] <Guest49> to a particular region
[21:37:57] <kepstin> note that gdigrab can be told to grab a region from a specific window, using coordinates relative to the window to select a subregion.
[21:38:11] <kepstin> you'll need to do that, if your window can move around.
[21:38:39] <Guest49> will check it out...also i was thinking if the user minimized the window
[21:39:10] *** Joins: thebombzen (~thebombze@71.73.92.220)
[21:39:21] <kepstin> i forget what happens with minimized windows :) I think on windows 7 and later it can actually still grab from them - sometimes? due to the compositing window manager.
[21:39:50] <kepstin> i don't think i actually tested that case, heh

[21:46:33] <Guest49> hope i'm using it in right way
[21:46:35] <BtbN> you probably have to permanently keep that window uncovered though, I don't think it captures it off-screen

[21:47:56] <kepstin> with the composited window manager, that's no longer true - it can capture from "covered" windows. I just forget about how it handles minimized windows.

[21:48:53] <kepstin> windows 7 and later have the thing where it shows a preview of minimized windows when you hover them on the taskbar, and i think that causes strange behaviour sometimes.
[21:49:23] <BtbN> It can, but I don't think gdigrab can
[21:49:47] <kepstin> gdigrab when working with a window handle does strange things :/
[21:50:11] <kepstin> (the "desktop" mode obviously can't capture covered windows)
[21:52:17] <kepstin> i don't even use gdigrab any more now that web browsers have built-in screensharing (i originally worked on getting it merged into ffmpeg to use in a downloadable screencapture app for an online conferencing tool)

[22:06:09] <JEEB> I did review the other one which just made the window name thing handle unicode names proper
[22:06:31] <JEEB> and yea, it's pretty cool now that browsers let you skip OS-specificness in various ways
[22:08:01] <JEEB> although the monoculture of things 100% under google control is kind of scary :P
[22:08:22] <kepstin> I don't know enough about the cross-thread safety of win32 apis to say whether that patch is good or not :(
[22:08:30] <JEEB> okies
[22:08:42] <JEEB> I'll have to figure it out later, the person who developed it seemed to know his stuff in general
[22:09:02] <kepstin> (I use firefox, since it can actually screen capture on wayland desktop through the xdg portal stuff)
[22:09:34] <kepstin> speaking of which, an xdg portal screencapture input to ffmpeg would probably be useful. I wonder if anyone's been working on that.
[22:09:44] <JEEB> yea, it's just scary how many libraries or specs are effectively controlled by them in a "throw over the wall" kind of fashion
[22:09:48] <JEEB> I haven't noticed yet
[22:09:53] <JEEB> could be useful indeed
[22:10:57] <kepstin> requires interfacing with pipewire, hmm
[22:11:55] <JEEB> I really wish all the luck to pipewire for a single, synchronized A/V input
[22:11:57] <kepstin> and doing dbus calls in the initialization, i believe
[22:12:00] <JEEB> yup
[22:12:23] <JEEB> because I think v4l2 etc missed a thing with making the user sync those
[22:14:26] <kepstin> yeah, i have an old analogue tv capture card that is capable of doing perfectly synchronized AV capture, giving an audio frame that matches each video frame, and there's no way to take advantage of that in linux.
[22:15:15] <kepstin> i don't think pipewire allows doing a single A+V stream tho, it still does them separately.

[22:21:17] <kepstin> makes sense, nvidia isn't really kms
[22:21:26] <kepstin> should work on nouveau tho
[22:21:47] <kepstin> if you want kmsgrab to work on nvidia closed source drivers, ask nvidia to fix their driver.
[22:22:49] *** Quits: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[22:23:25] <thebombzen> well even nvidia proprietary drivers still use linux's DRM, don't then?
[22:24:34] <BtbN> The Nvidia driver is not capable of driving a framebuffer console
[22:24:37] <BtbN> it's only for X/Wayland
[22:24:43] <BtbN> so no kms in that sense
[22:25:05] <thebombzen> ah, I was wondering how that worked cause mpv --gpu-context=drm works in a console, but what you're saying is that's not being done by nvidia at all
[22:25:22] <BtbN> What's not done by nvidia?
[22:25:27] <BtbN> It has DRM support, of course
[22:25:38] <BtbN> But that's entirely unrelated to KMS
[22:26:42] <JEEB> I'd guesstimate different flags/modifiers etc
[22:26:56] <JEEB> one could check with where it fails with -v debug or trace
[22:27:11] <kepstin> i think the particular issue with kmsgrab not working is that nvidia doesn't implement the apis for accessing shared memory buffers in the same way as the open-source kms drivers
[22:27:14] <BtbN> I think it simply doesn't have a KMS buffer or whatever that's called
[22:28:00] <kepstin> nvidia provides the minimum api needed to make wayland or other kms apps sort of work - and even then, they need to use an alternate buffer api
[22:28:27] <thebombzen> maybe I'm confusing DRM and KMS since they're always together
[22:28:39] <thebombzen> especially considering that I have early KMS set up with my nvidia driver
[22:29:00] <kepstin> most current drm drivers in the kernel implement kms
[22:29:32] <kepstin> nvidia's closed source driver provides a partial/not-fully-compatible kms implementation
[22:30:59] *** Quits: dostoyevsky2 (~sck@user/dostoyevsky2) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:31:15] <thebombzen> ah, so nvidia doesn't fully implement the API, it just exposes the minimum necessary to make X run on nvidia proprietary drivers
[22:31:25] <JEEB> thebombzen: well the APIs clearly are DRM, but yea it's different functionality
[22:31:29] <kepstin> to make wayland run *
[22:31:32] <thebombzen> (I'm ignoring wayland for now, I mean)
[22:31:35] <kepstin> x doesn't use kms on nvidia
[22:31:40] <thebombzen> huh
[22:31:45] <Hello71> i thought it does now
[22:31:59] <kepstin> they have a proprietary x11 driver that talks to their proprietary kernel driver in proprietary ways.
[22:32:20] <thebombzen> I reason I'm trying to use kmsgrab instead of X11grab is that kmsgrab ends up in the hardware. I'd like to potentially avoid hwdownload and hwupload if I"m not doing anything except feeding the output to nvenc
[22:32:36] <Hello71> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA: "nvidia 364.16 adds support for DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) kernel mode setting."
[22:33:10] <kepstin> Hello71: that sure is a headline that doesn't go into any details!
[22:33:12] <kepstin> and the details matter :)
[22:34:14] <thebombzen> speaking of x11grab, if I lie about video_size and tell it something smaller does it just crop
[22:34:23] *** Joins: fkaa (~fkaa@81-226-20-99-no256.tbcn.telia.com)
[22:34:33] <thebombzen> e.g. if I have a 1920x1080 screen and I tell it 1280x720 does it just grab a 1280x720 rect from the offset location
[22:34:44] <thebombzen> or does it derp, and I have to crop it with vf_crop
[22:35:08] <kepstin> thebombzen: the video size selects the size of the rectangle grabbed from the screen or window
[22:35:25] <kepstin> it doesn't "crop" so much as only grab that section of the screen
[22:35:32] <thebombzen> so yea it works nicely then. what about -framerate? what if the framerate I give doesn't agree with the actual monitor refresh rate
[22:35:37] <kepstin> (this only really matters over remote x11 - it means less data transfer)
[22:36:05] <kepstin> thebombzen: framerate on x11grab sets how long ffmpeg sleeps between asking for an image of the screen. there's no attempt to sync to refresh rate.
[22:36:36] <thebombzen> ah, so it's just how long it waits before polling the server again. if I set the refresh rate to exactly the monitor refresh rate is there any risk of duping or dropping frames due to hiccups or desyncs and the like
[22:36:47] <kepstin> yes, all the time.
[22:37:01] <thebombzen> is there a way to make that more reliable in circumstances where my system is not overloaded
[22:37:28] <kepstin> the sleep isn't very accurate
[22:37:36] <kepstin> no, other than using a different input device.
[22:38:00] <thebombzen> if I'm trying to grab my screen and do it properly is this one of those cases where I should just use a decided piece of software for this (e.g. obs)
[22:38:15] <thebombzen> or is there a way to do this right
[22:38:20] <kepstin> I'm not actually sure obs can do any better on linux.
[22:38:30] <kepstin> the "right" way to do it isn't supported by nvidia.
[22:38:36] <thebombzen> ah
[22:38:44] <kepstin> so please complain to them.
[22:38:57] <thebombzen> I remember a *long* time ago (like, years), certain opengl applications like games would flicker pretty horribly and get distorted with x11grab, is that due to the nature of x11grab or was it a bug (now fixed)

[22:39:32] <thebombzen> I was under the impression nvidia business model requires them to protect their drivers very heavily
[22:39:42] <kepstin> thebombzen: that would have been mostly fixed by changes to the x11 server and graphics drivers, rather than anything ffmpeg changed.
[22:39:43] *** Joins: SpeakerToMeat_ (~Speaker@190-203-129-193.dyn.dsl.cantv.net)
[22:40:04] <kepstin> ffmpeg just asks the x server for a pixmap of the screen, it gets whatever it gets.
[22:40:12] <thebombzen> ah so you didn't fix anything, so if it still occurs or not I'd just have to test
[22:40:33] <thebombzen> but I was under the impression nvidia couldn't open-source their driver by their business model, since the actual stats of their cards are worse than competition but their drivers are much better optimized to make up for it
[22:40:54] <thebombzen> if they just "give away" all their secrets for free to the "competition" then they might "lose their competitive advantage" or something
[22:41:09] <kepstin> i have no ideas or opinions on that matter, except that for gaming on windows they certainly do seem to have well-optimized drivers
