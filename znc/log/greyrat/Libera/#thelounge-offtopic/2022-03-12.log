[00:15:15] <bookworm> https://labrat.space/irc/99c2deb0dfa39b70/Screenshot_20220311-214451.png 
[00:15:24] <bookworm> why would there be damage?
[00:15:30] <bookworm> it's easy on the eyes
[00:15:37] <xnaas> straining to read such low contrast all the time lol
[00:15:50] <bookworm> also, whole and computer 
[00:16:05] <xnaas> that lounge version is bright af vs my screenshot of tildes.net tho
[00:16:06] <bookworm> low contrast? From a solarized user?
[00:16:53] <xnaas> it's not great either, but I like Dracula in some cases (not all)
[00:17:30] <bookworm> too blue... I like warm colors
[00:17:54] <bookworm> Dracula is really cold
[00:18:02] <xnaas> yes, he was

[00:19:50] <xnaas> anyway, as for blues and solarized and such
[00:20:00] <xnaas> I typically hate blue (and it gets filtered out at night)
[00:20:02] <xnaas> but like idk
[00:20:06] <xnaas> solarized just clicks for me
[00:20:19] <xnaas> I've tried switching notepad++ to any other color scheme and can't stand it lol

[03:16:28] <Snuupy> I'm just going to give up SSBs
[03:17:49] <Snuupy> the biggest issue I had was firefox's font rendering
[03:18:11] <Snuupy> that was fixed with https://superuser.com/questions/1650681/how-can-i-make-the-fonts-in-firefox-web-browser-looks-like-in-chromium-based-bro + https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/4ggqzo/psa_fix_firefox_fonts_on_windows/

[23:28:45] <JohnComputation> surprised you guys don't like firefox, it does just fine for me
[23:28:52] <JohnComputation> meh, to each their own.
[23:30:38] <JohnComputation> RAM usage can get a little high but that's because I usually have an ungodly amount of tabs opened
[23:46:03] <xnaas> Mozilla tries their hardest to destroy it more and more
[23:46:05] <xnaas> but what can ya do
[23:46:28] * xnaas still ain't touching google's garbage
[23:47:02] <bookworm> injecting ads into traffic / expired cert etc issues are simply too much for me
[23:47:57] <bookworm> if they're doing that, then they ain't better than google and then I might just use the better browser
[23:57:12] <Activ8> I use microsoft edge
[23:58:09] <bookworm> that's chrome with a different coat of paint 
[23:58:09] <JohnComputation> bookworm: never experienced or seen this
