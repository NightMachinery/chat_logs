[00:49:22] <gwern> aha! I've solved it. the 'soaring dogs' in kafa's story "investigations of a dog" are the advertisements from His Master's Voice (which Lem also alludes to).
[00:50:34] <gwern> the dancing dogs are a circus troupe, obviously, but the soaring dogs are harder. they have no legs and soar because they are painted advertisements which are put high up (at least from the dog's-eye), and they are described as highly voluble because the observing dog is confused, like the His Master's Voice dog, about the source of voices
[00:52:30] <gwern> (but since kafka's conceit is that dogs are in denial about humans, anything they hear must be of dog origin, and so the narrator concludes that soaring dogs are endlessly talking nonsense)

[00:54:10] <gwern> it has a WP article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Master%27s_Voice which is pretty thorough but there's no actual reason you'd ever look it up
[00:54:10] <Robomot> His Master's Voice - Wikipedia (His Master's Voice (HMV) was the name of a major British record label created in 1901 by The Gramophone Co. Ltd.[1] The phrase was coined in the late 1890s as the title of a painting depicting a terrier-mix dog named Nipper listening to a wind-up disc gramophone and tilting his head.[2][3] In the original, unmodified 1898 painting, the dog was listening to a cylinder phonograph.  …)

[00:58:19] <gwern> oh, it was quite international. as I said, even Lem alludes to it
[00:58:21] <Khoth> (even today I mean)
[00:58:40] <gwern> that's why his novel is titled that. he's rather mercilessly mocking humans as the clueless, hopelessly stupid, dog
[01:00:03] <gwern> anyway the story is at https://www.vanderbilt.edu/olli/class-materials/Franz_Kafka.pdf#page=310 and I was going to split it out after reading it, because I think it's a pretty good satire of the "what if aliens are actually all around us" excuse for the Great Silence - no, we'd notice, much like you can't seriously imagine dogs don't know that humans feed them

[01:27:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is an array covariant with its stored object type but a set is not

[01:31:15] <Robomot> Obormot\Gaia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance
[01:31:15] <Robomot> In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. If the greater values of one variable mainly correspond with the greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for the lesser values, the covariance is positive. In the opposite case, when the greater values of one variable mainly correspond to the lesser values of the other,, the covarian…
[01:31:16] <Robomot> …ce is negative. The sign of the covariance therefore shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. The magnitude of the covariance is not easy to interpret because it is not normalized and hence depends on the magnitudes of the variables. The normalized version of the covariance, the correlation coefficient, however, shows by its magnitude the strength of the linear relation.

[01:32:21] <aweinstock> Obormot\Gaia: what operations do you have on the set/what datastructure is the set? I'd expect a hashset/btreeset to be covarient, but one represented by a callback with an indicator function to be contravariant
[01:33:23] <Obormot\Gaia> aweinstock: Set as in NSSet, though I'd expect this would also hold true in other, analogous, implementations

[01:40:02] <Obormot\Gaia> This is weird. NSSet and NSMutableSet are listed as covariant in the docs. But I'm looking at the header file right now and, while NSSet is indeed covariant, NSMutableSet is not... (in fact this question was prompted by me getting an error about this when writing a category on it)
[01:40:03] <aweinstock> I mean as opposed to something exotic like representing it as an indicator function (i.e. just the `member` callback, an `a -> Bool`), which would be contravariant
[01:40:17] <Obormot\Gaia> Did this change at some point, then...
[01:40:20] <Obormot\Gaia> But why...
[01:41:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Weird. I guess this turned out to be a history of Cocoa development question and not a type theory question :\
[01:45:14] <PlanckWalk> Mutable container types usually should be invariant
[01:49:52] <Obormot\Gaia> Well it's covariant now, heh
[01:50:01] <aweinstock> reads from a mutable container should be contravariant (you can read an Object from an Array<Animal>) and writes to a mutable container should be covariant (you can store a Cat in an Array<Animal>)
[01:50:56] <aweinstock> if you can do covariant reads and writes, you can write a Dog to an Array<Animal>, and cast it by reading a Cat from the same index
[01:51:55] <gwern> I'd expect the type system to simply require that you provide a Dog->Cat conversion function, but maybe C# is too weak
[01:51:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Not sure the former point is relevant, at least in a language like ObjC ... you read an Animal from an Array<Animal> and then assign it to an Object (NSObject, or id) pointer
[01:56:24] <PlanckWalk> It's worst in language that allow things like  cats = some Array<Cat> or other,  Array<Animal> animals = cats
[01:56:43] <PlanckWalk> (Where the assignment is reference assignment, not copy assignment)
[01:57:40] <PlanckWalk> Because then you can continue with  animals.add(aDog), and try to get a Cat from cats array.
[01:57:57] <Obormot\Gaia> You can totally do that in Objective C
[01:58:26] <Obormot\Gaia> Because the templating / generics are "lightweight"; they're just hints
[01:58:34] <PlanckWalk> If the type is invariant, you aren't allowed to do the Array<Animal> animals = cats reference assignment
[01:58:42] <PlanckWalk> But you can if it's covariant.
[01:58:45] <Obormot\Gaia> Ultimately an NSArray is an NSArray and it can have anything in it
[01:58:58] <PlanckWalk> I see
[01:59:01] <Obormot\Gaia> Any subclass of id, anyway
[01:59:22] <Obormot\Gaia> (And then if you want something even more exotic / unsafe I think you can use CFArray?)
[02:00:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Really, in Objective C, you can cast any object to any object and you can send whatever messages you like to it
[02:00:30] <Obormot\Gaia> If the object you're sending a message can't respond to that message? No problem

[03:04:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "No insect is loathed more than the red fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, in the southern United States. Entrenched in about 230,000 acres in 13 states, the ant lives in colonies of up to 50,000 insects that inhabit mounds up to three feet high and hard enough to wreck farm machinery that runs into them. The ants are aggressive and have a painful sting, which has been blamed for human deaths as well as that of livestock. Accidenta
[03:04:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> lly imported from South America around 1900, the ant has so far survived all efforts to do it in, including a Federal eradication campaign that came to an end in the 1970's when the insecticide Mirex, which the ants were surviving anyhow, was banned as a potential human carcinogen."
[03:04:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then:
[03:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The Department of Agriculture is now claiming considerable success with a new chemical that may work where insecticides failed. The substance, called MV-678, is a synthetic that mimics the ant's own juvenile hormones. It is dangerous, the department says, only to insects, and a ''very narrow'' range of insects at that. It does not kill the ants, but retards their growth until the ant society collapses." [emphasis mine]
[03:05:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "At first, the immature ants dosed with MV-678 by their nursemaids developed into malformed sexually mature ants, but later failed to develop at all, remaining in the juvenile stage -and staying home in the nest.

[04:49:53] <two2thehead> Zooming in even further to the receptor binding domain (that's the part of the virus that makes first contact with our body's cells), it has 10 mutations compared to just two for the Delta variant that swept the world.
[04:49:58] <two2thehead> This level of mutation has most likely come from a single patient who was unable to beat the virus."

[06:55:34] <Obormot\Gaia> Continuing to make my way through Appendix N... finished reading Philip Jose Farmer's _The Maker of Universes_ (1965; first book of his "World of Tiers" series). Amusing isekai / "portal fantasy" type story (or... is it?? there's a twist at the end which is either clever or dumb, depending on your perspective).
[06:58:14] <Obormot\Gaia> Fun bits: first of all, some extremely obvious "oh wow so that's where <D&D thing> came from!!" moments (e.g., the axebeak; I always figured it was another "Gygax made it up by looking at a cheap Chinese plastic toy monster" case like the owlbear/bulette/etc., but no, it's actually from this novel... ironically, because we never actually *meet* one of the things, they're just named, alluded to as being very scary, and then at
[06:58:14] <Obormot\Gaia>  some point the protagonist encounters some... during a time-skip, so we don't even get to read about it)
[07:01:01] <Obormot\Gaia> More amusingly and unusually: fantasy Jews!! Yes, it's common enough to get fantasy ancient Greeks, fantasy classical Chinese, etc., but here we have not just fantasy Jews but fantasy *medieval* Jews, from central Europe; a bunch of them were transported to this artificial alternate reality (along with various other populations from various other times) and then continued evolving culturally, side by side with similarly-transp
[07:01:01] <Obormot\Gaia> orted Teutonic Knights, which of course is a provocation that cannot stand, with the obvious result that we get *Yiddish-speaking fantasy Jewish knights*

[07:08:23] <Obormot\Gaia> "A 1975 novel [by P. J. Farmer], Venus on the Half-Shell, created a stir in the larger literary community and media. It purported to be written in the first person by one "Kilgore Trout," a fictional character appearing as an underappreciated science fiction writer in several of Kurt Vonnegut's novels. The escapade did not please Vonnegut when some reviewers not only concluded that it had been written by Vonnegut himself, but
[07:08:23] <Obormot\Gaia>  that it was a worthy addition to his works. Farmer did have permission from Vonnegut to write the book, though Vonnegut later said he regretted giving permission.[9]"
[07:09:13] <nshepperd> saturn2: np :)
[07:09:50] <Obormot\Gaia> Also Farmer: "The Riverworld series follows the adventures of such diverse characters as Richard Francis Burton, Hermann Göring, and Samuel Clemens through a bizarre afterlife in which every human ever to have lived is simultaneously resurrected along a single river valley that stretches over an entire planet."
[07:11:47] <Obormot\Gaia> (And my first introduction to his work was through an excellent short story called "Sail On!

[07:17:07] <Obormot\Gaia> "At this time, I was a senior in Peoria Central High School. I knew I would be a writer some day. After I recovered, I made notes of my dreams or nightmares or hallucinations or, as I now believe, distorted visions of scenes momentarily appearing from another world. Somehow, when the fever was at its heights, it opened to me windows to another dimension or parallel universe. I was not in that world, but I did see what was
[07:17:07] <Obormot\Gaia>  taking place in a smal area in it."
[07:18:20] <gwern> but does he tell us which?
[07:18:39] <Obormot\Gaia> "Still, the visions of that huge, sentient, and malicious parrot bother me. Were they entirely unconnected to the worlds of the Lords ? Or is the answer to the mystery something else ? Perhaps, the parrot embodies an untold story. He may have been involved in one of Kickaha's adventures. But, for some reason, I could not receive the story. It may be that the wicked bird himself shut the windows of perception as soon as he was
[07:18:39] <Obormot\Gaia>  aware that I was receiving the visions of him.
[07:18:39] <Obormot\Gaia> But that parrot haunts me even now."

[09:44:14] <PapuaHardyNet> could you clarify what you mean by it being a litmus test? there's a lot of social context you rely on that I'm missing
[09:44:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> As in, it tests whether you're in a certain social class
[09:45:26] <rsaarelm> PapuaHardyNet: I mean what donation size feels incongruously weird to you and what doesn't.
[09:45:46] <rsaarelm> $10k might also feel very, very weird and $100k might feel not-weird.
[09:46:29] <rsaarelm> I guess I'd read the $10k one as perfectly normal inheritance tax evasion scheme.
[09:47:43] <PapuaHardyNet> so QC is in upper middle class because he found 100k USD gift weird, but if he didn't find it weird, then he would be an upper class?
[09:47:57] <rsaarelm> Something like that yeah.
[09:49:43] <rsaarelm> Local gift and inheritance tax law says you can gift up to 4999 euro to the same person once per three years without incurring gift tax, so if you like your kids, expect them to inherit you and want to do some healthy tax evasion that can be standard operating procedure.

[10:56:46] <feep[work]> internet: "lol, look out for covid"
[10:56:52] <feep[work]> today: "höcke tests positive for covid"
[10:57:26] <feep[work]> well, yesterday by now
[10:58:06] <rsaarelm> Wasn't there the thing where Merkel went "legislature updated, everyone not vaccinated will now go to jail from now on. Okay, with this done, I'm gonna retire and move to Spain, have fun running the next government everyone."

[10:59:27] <feep[work]> I mean, I don't think it matters politically
[11:02:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why "3G"
[11:02:17] <feep[work]> geimpft, genesen, getestet
[11:02:29] <rmmh> I thought covid was 5G
[11:02:36] <rmmh> truly, germany is a confusing land
[11:02:42] <feep[work]> ge is a common prefix for "done to"
[11:02:43] <PapuaHardyNet> Germany can't afford 5G towers
[11:02:50] <rmmh> ge-sundheit
[11:02:57] <feep[work]> yes
[11:03:29] <feep[work]> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-West_Germanic/sund -> gasund -> gesund
[11:03:29] <Robomot> Reconstruction:Proto-West Germanic/sund - Wiktionary
[11:03:45] <feep[work]> ie. "made sound"
[11:04:47] <feep[work]> neat: sound has two totally different etymologies, depending which version you mean
[11:05:00] <feep[work]> one via sund, one via sonus
[11:05:36] <feep[work]> ge- is sort of == english -ed
[11:06:59] <PapuaHardyNet> so ge- is a past tense
[11:07:12] <feep[work]> not really
[11:07:20] <feep[work]> hm
[11:07:23] <feep[work]> is vaccinated past tense?
[11:07:26] <feep[work]> he is vaccinated
[11:07:48] <feep[work]> I think it's cause that form in english comes via implication from "an event happened in the past" to describe a state?
[11:08:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "vaccinated" is an adjective in this case
[11:08:05] <feep[work]> so is genesen
[11:08:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "He is vaccinated" has the same form as "He is purple"
[11:08:25] <Khoth> he was vaccinated is past tense though
[11:08:26] <feep[work]> right, so -ed isn't past tense either
[11:08:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Khoth: Indeed, and in fact "He is vaccinated" is a colloquialism in the first place; the formal version would be "He has been vaccinated"
[11:09:17] <feep[work]> anyway, in summary ge- has nothing to do with tenses in german
[11:09:45] <feep[work]> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ge-#Prefix_7

[11:09:52] <feep[work]> wiktionary is love wiktionary is life
[11:11:07] <PapuaHardyNet> I spent my high school years thinking ge- means "past tense of a sort"
[11:11:27] <PapuaHardyNet> when attached to verbs as a prefix, at laest
[11:11:32] <feep[work]> well, it does happen, see section 4 of the link
[11:12:13] <feep[work]> but it's one of those omnipresent prefixes that does lots of things depending

[17:27:32] <feep[work]> I have complicated feelings about this that I'm just going to avoid.
[17:31:14] <PapuaHardyNet> what is nu
[17:31:29] <feep[work]> scary african corona mutant
[17:32:01] <PapuaHardyNet> meh
[17:32:50] <kuudes> feep[work], oh
[17:32:58] <kuudes> do you want to clarify?
[17:33:42] <feep[work]> it's sort of a mix of "from the outside view, this is the sort of thing that makes us look bad" and "my primary corona concern is infecting my parents, and I don't want to tell them that I injected a thing someone sent me in the mail, but I'd have to"
[17:33:54] <feep[work]> and also, "but they're your parents, shouldn't you take the risk"
[17:33:58] <feep[work]> hence, complicated
[17:34:08] <kuudes> Betawolf, huh, quite accurate, nice!
[17:34:50] <kuudes> feep[work], hmm, thanks
[17:35:38] <feep[work]> but also the death rates among vaccinated are so low now that I'm not even sure if I should worry, and also also my parents probably encounter a good fraction more people than I do now.
[17:36:24] <feep[work]> and also also my parents are actively trying to get a booster shot, which imo totally obviates the risk, the only reason I'm worrying now is that we're sort of in the 3-4 week area where it starts being "well, you don't need a booster yet, but"
[17:36:40] <feep[work]> even though we both have the az/bion combo, which is supposed to be better past four months
[17:37:13] <feep[work]> like, if we were both boosted, I wouldn't worry at all.
[17:37:14] <kuudes> there are now threedosers who have got nu in israel
[17:37:24] <feep[work]> sure but probabilistically
[17:37:25] <kuudes> so at least we know it can breakthrough
[17:37:40] <feep[work]> and the vaccine validation is broken anyways
[17:37:41] <kuudes> well, sample so far there is n=4 and one of them is threedoser and rest twodosers
[17:37:53] <nshepperd> depends how much benefit this 'substance' will have imo
[17:38:00] <kuudes> uncertain
[17:38:05] <kuudes> and it could be harmful
[17:38:20] <nshepperd> maybe we should just pool money to bribe some low level pfizer employee for paxlovid
[17:38:31] <kuudes> but it will employ use of a gene gun
[17:38:38] <feep[work]> "< nshepperd> depends how much benefit this 'substance' will have imo" --rooc, rationalists on injecting things sent to them in the mail
[17:39:34] <kuudes> I am unsure if we need more people or not, but I am broadcasting so that people can premake their minds on if they want to spend money on this or not
[17:39:54] <kuudes> personally I separated the decision to spend money on from the decision on if I use it
[17:40:14] <kuudes> I still have the unused ratvac in my fridge, because I got the official vaccine soon enough

[17:50:47] <kuudes> indeed.
[17:50:54] <feep[work]> might be a downside of vaccination?

[17:51:10] <feep[work]> oh heck.
[17:51:16] <feep[work]> let's hope it was an outlier.
[17:51:26] <kuudes> upside is that it shows in regular pcr result
[17:51:43] <kuudes> so it should be faster to find than pure sampling

[20:59:49] <PapuaHardyNet> oh btw, kuudes, your rants were what got me to get my first dose months ago, so tanks, I think
[20:59:51] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, my near family has now 4 doses each
[21:00:03] <kuudes> kids are a problem
[21:00:16] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, nice! good!
[21:00:31] <Gurkenglas> the bottleneck in my case was that the doctor's office said their appointments are backed up for two months so in fact if i got bumped by saying it's my first dose, that would be one delayed appointment for someone else.
[21:01:17] <Gurkenglas> what is your proposed mechanism of action for health bureaucrats? stopping decentralization of vaccination?
[21:01:37] <PapuaHardyNet> couldn't you just buy a vaccine dose and inject yourself?
[21:02:01] <Gurkenglas> i don't believe you can just go and *buy* the scarce thing do you think this is america
[21:02:06] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, no, they are not sold
[21:02:18] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, my bad
[21:02:35] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, hmm, it seems to me that in germany they may actually be getting vaccination machinery up to speed again, so you might be correct
[21:02:48] <kuudes> over here we still vaccinate much less than 1/10 of the normal pace
[21:02:58] <kuudes> which is 1% of population per day in developed countries
[21:03:31] <Gurkenglas> it sounds like all that money would be better spent coming up with some trick for not making it so expensive to put damn needles in damn arms

[21:50:01] <kuudes> the devil is now named omicron https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant
[21:50:13] <feepbot> The Omicron variant, also known as lineage B.1.1.529 is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
[21:50:19] <Gurkenglas> pretty gud
[21:51:47] <gwern> didn't go for omega, eh? maybe that would've felt too much like tempting murphy
[21:56:18] <Gurkenglas> does china take tourists this time of year?
[21:56:57] <kuudes> you need to get prisoned for at least 14 days on entry and usually between zones
[21:57:01] <gwern> you'll have to check the pandemic forecast, sounds stormy
[21:57:41] <kuudes> over here expert already warned against travelling, as even though it is currently possible, things are now volatile insofar that you may not be able to return
[21:57:43] <Gurkenglas> if this evades the vaccine that sounds like another market crash, right?
[21:58:01] <kuudes> news here have talked there has been such today, but I have observed but some percents
[21:58:16] <kuudes> but it is not yet known if it evades vaccine
[21:58:36] <kuudes> it seems to evade at least infection immunity though, very likely
[21:58:38] <PapuaHardyNet> oh god, I can't take one more year of this pandemic
[21:58:51] <kuudes> but it seems possible the vaccines will work against it to some extent
[21:58:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd like to graduate to a sensible economy ffs
[21:59:13] <Gurkenglas> step 1: short s&p. 2: get omicron. 3: fly to usa 4: profit 5: get dragged to nuremberg
[21:59:42] <kuudes> and it seems likely the vaccines currently in phases should work relatively well, as as far as I see the mutations already have been in some other variant, so vaccines that target delta or deltaplus likely should already incorporate those mutations
[22:00:00] <kuudes> "2020s were the first decade of pandemic"
[22:00:39] <Gurkenglas> maybe it was a bad idea to introduce assasination markets for countries
[22:00:57] <kuudes> wat
[22:01:16] <Gurkenglas> country-level index funds that you can short.
[22:01:20] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas listed a method to become a biological bomb
[22:01:32] <PapuaHardyNet> and how to profit using it by shorting a country-level index fund
[22:01:37] <PapuaHardyNet> very smart!
[22:01:59] <PapuaHardyNet> (I was being serious, the exclamation mark is not sarcasm)
[22:02:10] <kuudes> oh yeah, I closed the computer last night because it made nosie
[22:05:01] <gwern> I don't think it would work because the market is going to assume omicron is going to infect china very soon, given the failure of their zero-tolerance eradiction on the apparently far less transmissive delta
[22:06:00] <gwern> at best, you'd be able to manipulate the timing and bring forward an announcement by a few days/weeks... but then you're extremely dependent on the exact details of the extremely stochastic spread, official announcements, how extreme the markets will react to them etc
[22:06:12] <Gurkenglas> failure? google says they have 2-digit cases per day, are those lies?
[22:06:18] <gwern> that's a failure
[22:06:34] <gwern> that means it's pretty much endemic and spreading easily
[22:07:02] <gwern> they can keep squashing hotspots but it's not going to zero. and that was *before*. and every day that passes, the public loses willpower
[22:07:35] <Gurkenglas> i thought those cases are, like, a result of the constant influx of travellers
[22:08:02] <gwern> that's another problem, but it's not like every case is someone who just flew in and hopped in a taxi
[22:08:07] <gwern> eg you can try to buy your options with high leverage, but then Xi orders cenosrship for an extra week and your options expire worthless, or the market thinks omicron can be squashed and waits a week before plunging 10%
[22:08:29] *** Joins: schmudde (~schmudde@public.toolboxoffice.it)
[22:09:57] <Gurkenglas> couldnt you stop all travel to halt omicron spread? sounds like the lesser cost.
[22:10:21] <kuudes> that is what they attempt currently
[22:10:40] <kuudes> but it has already been observed to have spread into belgium, hong kong and israel
[22:10:41] <gwern> if they did that, then our Typhoid Trader couldn't get in either
[22:11:58] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, what i read was that it was observed (later than they expected!) in quarantined travelers. im saying "no travel. planes get shot"
[22:12:22] <kuudes> new zealand did the correct quarantine and it worked quite well
[22:14:20] <Gurkenglas> "and then we point our particle accelerator at the crash site"
[22:16:18] <vrs> ohh omicron is a good letter
[22:16:48] <vrs> implies the existence of an even worse omega variant
[22:17:31] <Gurkenglas> that one's reserved for when we have alphafold prove that it's the worst possible variant
