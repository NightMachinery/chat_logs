[17:30:14] <Glizzster[m]> i used to use qbittorrent but i was searching for a non bloated and light weight client
[17:30:38] <pystardust[m]1> Glizzster[m]: tried transmission-cli?
[17:30:50] <Glizzster[m]> installing it rn :)
[17:33:21] <pystardust[m]1> Glizzster[m]: Noice, btw try opening your ports for torrenting to get inbound connection. Makes it crazy fast
[17:34:07] <Glizzster[m]> how do i do that?
[17:34:30] <pystardust[m]1> We made a script to make a torrent and share it using magnet link, but that work only if ports are forwarded for atleast one of the peer
[17:35:08] <Glizzster[m]> oh
[17:35:16] <pystardust[m]1> Glizzster[m]: You can do it in ur router settings, go to 192.168.1.1 or what every your router page is and add a forwarding rule

[18:00:58] <Aryan[m]> * ++, Nice idea
[18:04:36] <pystardust> we could start working on a webpage at first, I am willing to fund fo the initial server and domain name. gtlsgamr is good with flask, so we can get a blog post started. We could have a mailserver to which people can submit articles/video links which can be shared after fact checking
[18:05:09] <h[m]1> pystardust: Only domain need
[18:05:14] <h[m]1> We can use Hugo
[18:05:16] <h[m]1> No hosting boom boom
[18:05:56] <_devnull[m]> <pystardust[m]1> "Guys what about having a webpage..." <- its great idea.
[18:05:56] <_devnull[m]> but it aimed should be introducing more Indian duded to Linux a sorta way where their eyes will be sparked with magical affection of linux.
[18:06:12] <_devnull[m]> s/duded/peeps/

[18:06:53] <h[m]1>  ‚ú® P I Z Z A Z Z ‚ú®

[18:08:16] <mangeshrex[m]> currently
[18:08:28] <_devnull[m]> site should be minimal as possible.
[18:08:28] <_devnull[m]> any jio, non jio users must able to access it even when there daily quata is exhausted.
[18:09:01] <_devnull[m]> but shouldnt be boring as well
[18:10:48] <Circuitlover[m]> > <>_ /dev/null> site should be minimal as possible.
[18:10:48] <Circuitlover[m]> > any jio, non jio users must able to access it even when there daily quata is exhausted.
[18:10:48] <Circuitlover[m]> then static site may be the answer
[18:12:13] <pystardust>      
[18:12:18] <pystardust>        
[18:16:29] <pystardust[m]1> <h[m]1> "No hosting boom boom" <- having a server would allow us to get mail server etc for mailling list and all, and we can even host chat platforms etc as a community
[18:17:12] <pystardust[m]1> > <>_ /dev/null> site should be minimal as possible.
[18:17:12] <pystardust[m]1> > any jio, non jio users must able to access it even when there daily quata is exhausted.
[18:17:12] <pystardust[m]1> maybe we can laydown some rules for the site. Like no js, compressed images etc
[18:17:44] <ramram[m]> is it even possible to comment in a site without making account ?
[18:18:10] <pystardust[m]1> ramram[m]: yes it is, we can easily make it with flask (just like how 4chan does)
[18:18:32] <pystardust[m]1> ( 4chat doesn't use flask )
[18:18:38] <pystardust[m]1> s/4chat/4chan/
[18:18:46] <ramram[m]> pystardust[m]1: this would be helpful
[18:19:16] <pystardust[m]1> but that would lead to some problems, like harmfull / abusive comments
[18:30:45] <Arya[m]> <h[m]1> "Sounds like a cult" <- üòÜ
[18:30:58] <Arya[m]> <ramram[m]> "is it even possible to comment..." <- i use htmlcommentbox.com in my blog
[18:31:15] <Arya[m]> it requires non-free js but its pretty minimakl
[18:37:23] <pystardust> mangeshrex[m]: terminal use when?
[18:42:12] <pystardust> ramram[m]: To organize my files especially when there are multiple download version I user this script I made to get all the versions together http://0x0.st/-7Cv.sh . Other wise just making use of the shells glob * with basic commands
[18:42:50] <pystardust> by versions I mean files that are like "file.png" "file (1).png" "file (2).png" the script takes all these and puts them in one folder
[18:46:47] <ramram[m]> wow this is neat, can you how do you use glob * too
[18:55:12] <ramram[m]> and is there any we can name a picture automatically according to what's in it ?
[18:55:14] <pystardust> oh globbing is for basic tasks, like ` mv *.png destination/ `, and other stuff like that, also you might like parameter_expansion like this `mkdir sem{01..05}/MA{01..05}`, this will make a directory for each sem and inside each sem there will be directories for from 01 to 05, like sem01/MA03 etc
[18:55:51] <pystardust> ramram[m]: like see the content of the picture are rename it? thats some ai stuff, but if you just wanna know some details like rgb/brightness then you could
[18:57:01] <pystardust> you could use an image recognition AI's api and rename the image to it
[18:57:18] <_devnull[m]> <pystardust[m]1> "> <>_ /dev/null> site should..." <- yes, git repo might be a way. we would create issue and discuss stuff on it
[18:58:12] <pystardust> _devnull[m]: if we have a server then we can host our own git, and make stuff fully libre + decentralized
[19:00:44] <_devnull[m]> pystardust: are you thinking to buy dedicated vps?
[19:01:03] <pystardust> _devnull[m]: yeah, something like a 5 dollar plan
[19:01:27] <_devnull[m]> pystardust: cool
[19:01:44] <pystardust> have exams going on rn but ill get working on it as soon as I get time
[19:02:09] <ramram[m]> <pystardust> "you could use an image recogniti..." <- is it even possible to do anything like this ? in future we definitely would require such things
[19:02:50] <_devnull[m]> pystardust: i am learning cloud and data science lets see how i can contribute to the project.
[19:03:32] <pystardust> nice
[19:06:26] <pystardust> ramram[m]: its possible to do it rn, but they are not free. You need api key from amazon/google, ig there is a free trail. Do you know about google lens? its pretty accurate and if you give it your images it will tell what they are, it too has an api
[19:07:00] <pystardust> integrating the api would be easy, just getting access to one is a pain
[19:08:43] <ramram[m]> pystardust: and we can use that api ?????? this thing can be very helpful, all the time i download something, its renamed to something random number, isn't it responsibility of the owner of site to check it out
[19:09:08] <mangeshrex[m]> <pystardust> "mangeshrex: terminal use when?" <- Wen windows opens for me to go outside
[19:15:57] <pystardust> ramram[m]: you can use it, register and try it out
[19:24:19] <ramram[m]> and one more, how do you make a image without gimp, is there anything something where i just paste the image and export that's all i need
[19:24:33] <ramram[m]> can i do it imagemagick ?
[19:26:44] <pystardust[m]1> ramram[m]: Where are you pasting from?
[19:27:05] <ramram[m]> from clipboard
[19:27:54] <pystardust[m]1> ramram[m]: Paste it directly into a file then, xclip can handle images
[19:29:16] <ramram[m]> pystardust[m]1: didn't get it, can you elaborate it
[19:30:38] <pystardust[m]1> xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -o > example.png
[19:30:38] <pystardust[m]1> Thus will paste image into file
