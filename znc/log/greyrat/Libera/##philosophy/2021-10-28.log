[00:24:00] <ro-bot-o> [url] Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake) | The Canadian Encyclopedia | www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca
[00:25:12] *** Joins: emmeka (~emmeka@162-251-198-66.dynamic.parolink.net)
[00:25:24] <I_Am_M00t> weow, til
[00:26:27] <biys> so in canada there's this group of people that were, as the idea goes, devastated as a result of colonialism
[00:26:49] <biys> they're american aboriginals or first nations or native americans
[00:27:08] <I_Am_M00t> as the idea goes?
[00:27:10] <I_Am_M00t> ok
[00:27:39] <biys> the first thing i think we need to talk about is if a nation has a right to exist
[00:27:46] <biys> secondly we'd discuss to what end
[00:27:59] <biys> it seems like the corriculum is based on presuppositions about how best to live within the world
[00:28:12] <biys> it seems to be based on some kind of humanist ideas
[00:28:23] <I_Am_M00t> do we really need to talk about it? isn't that the real first thing we need to talk about?
[00:28:56] <biys> that's kind of the thing.  it's discussed in a manner where it's not really questioned.  it's automatically assumed this or that about how things ought to be
[00:29:21] <I_Am_M00t> yea, so what's the purpose of your line of questioning? I'm suspicious
[00:30:07] <biys> if we're going to talk as though we have presupposed axioms on some particular matter or another, i'd say we at least need to come to some kind of idea about those axioms
[00:30:22] <biys> or else we're just kind of spraying some kind of opinion based on a narrative we're subscribing
[00:30:51] <biys> it's like this.  were the settlers inherently evil?  was the civilizing notions of the imperialist army malevolent in nature?
[00:31:17] <I_Am_M00t> yes yes, so before that discussion. Do you mind revealing what the alternative narrative is?
[00:31:30] <biys> we can look back at things that've transpired through space and time and make a judgement about this or that
[00:31:38] <mwsb> Delf: yeah I think so
[00:32:26] <biys> idk if we can look back and make THEE judgement.  i'd also say the narrative that's looked at depends on what data and how it's being interpreted.  like earlier this week there was a conversation in here with pussipupu
[00:32:40] <biys> where mnemon was making the claims of when we were the most free
[00:32:56] <biys> pussipupu summarization of the time period was that it was problematic for specific groups of people
[00:32:59] <biys> like women for example
[00:33:12] <biys> mnemon was talking specifically about the freedoms people had at the time
[00:33:25] <biys> the conversations don't even align
[00:33:56] <I_Am_M00t> biys: Does the alternative narrative involve believing that colonials slaughtering all native americans was ok?
[00:34:02] <biys> it also seems weird to say that as ar esult of some kind of terible thing that happened during that time the WHOLE TIME can be painted with a single brush
[00:34:19] <biys> well technically speaking the aboriginals were involved in the aboriginals slaughter on both sides (english and french)
[00:34:33] <I_Am_M00t> biys: do you also think we should discuss whether the Holocaust was actually bad?
[00:34:35] <biys> the blood of native americans isn't only on "white" hands
[00:34:49] <I_Am_M00t> right right...
[00:35:21] <I_Am_M00t> lol, trojan horses are fun
[00:35:51] <biys> I_Am_M00t: the question about the germans is more-so a matter of... are german people stupid or are they inherently evil?  hitler happened for a reason imo.  regardless if you think that what happened as a general observation was good or bad, there's significantly more to it than a generalization of this action or that
[00:36:09] <I_Am_M00t> biys: im not interested in denying that mass slaughter is bad
[00:36:23] <biys> that isn't the conversation
[00:36:31] <I_Am_M00t> it is
[00:36:45] <biys> please elaborate
[00:36:49] <I_Am_M00t> nope
[00:37:05] <biys> the summarization of the evens is genocide
[00:37:13] <biys> :s/evens/events/
[00:37:24] <biys> i would say that significantly MORE happened than genocide
[00:37:35] <I_Am_M00t> and you disagree, right? ;)
[00:37:49] <biys> to summarize the totality of the events as genocide is a drastic over simplification
[00:38:10] <I_Am_M00t> so you think genocide is on, bcause you redefine genocide to mean "winning"
[00:38:21] <biys> cause it begs the questions of the intent of those that were acting in that time and space
[00:38:26] *** Joins: white5moke (~white5mok@ip72-219-109-30.oc.oc.cox.net)
[00:38:31] <biys> we'd have to autoamtically assume they were either stupid or malevolent
[00:38:35] <I_Am_M00t> therefore the discussion isn't about genocide being on, but about winning... right?
[00:39:11] <biys> is that what  you think i'm saying?
[00:39:13] <I_Am_M00t> look biys , i don't know what happened to you that you take the less moral side on every topic
[00:39:26] <I_Am_M00t> I know that's what you're saying biys
[00:42:15] <biys> i'd go as far as to say that colonialism happened as a result of neoliberalism
[00:43:01] <biys> it's the obvious conclusion when you significantly increase interactions
[00:43:49] <I_Am_M00t> so murder is ok, because people felt like it?
[00:45:17] <biys> murder is "okay", because people "felt like it"
[00:45:20] <biys> idk what that means
[00:45:28] <mnemon> biys: we were talking about nationalistic "myths" or narratives and whether or not the "land of the free" is fictive one
[00:45:34] <biys> are you saying murder is bad becaue we don't feel like it?
[00:45:35] <biys> "feel"
[00:45:50] <biys> mnemon: yes
[00:46:13] <biys> but the summarization of events to support the narrative from either side wa sthe point i was trying to make
[00:46:55] <mnemon> also, colonialism predates even classical liberalism by quite a lot
[00:47:14] <biys> classical liberalism as defined
[00:47:18] <biys> not necessarily be trait
[00:47:50] <mnemon> many of the core ideals were rather novel
[00:48:03] <biys> yes, very romantic
[00:48:14] <biys> but more-than-likely as a result of the need to expand
[00:48:22] <biys> to remain competitive on some market or another
[00:49:35] <I_Am_M00t> smh
[00:52:51] <biys> the summarization of events seems interesting to me

[01:14:01] <Ungwelian> evolv, even Buddha's own sangha wasn't a pure democracy :)
[01:15:26] <evolv> Ungwelian, do you know who Buddha chose to leave in charge when the time came for his death?
[01:15:59] <Ungwelian> I don't remember.
[01:16:05] <evolv> It's in MN 108
[01:16:12] <evolv> the answer is nobody
[01:17:30] <evolv> the dhamma and the vinaya are the authorty, not a being
[01:17:56] <evolv> the Buddha discovered the dhamma after it had been lost from the previous Buddha. He was the first Buddha to share it
[01:18:09] <evolv> those who wanted to learn the dhamma chose him as their teacher
[01:18:24] <Ungwelian> Clearly it's important for you to believe that :)
[01:19:01] <evolv> it doesn't matter whether anyone believes that happened or not, it is in the the suttas
[01:19:32] <Ungwelian> That sounds like something a literal believer in the Bible would say.
[01:20:26] <evolv> I believe it is in the Vinaya where Buddha was asked what to do with someone who was not following the rules and causing trouble
[01:20:44] <evolv> like what kind of punishment. Buddha said no punishment, not even deprivation of food
[01:21:10] <evolv> someone who doesn't want to live the monastic life, naturally, would suffer the consequences of living with nothing
[01:21:59] <Ungwelian> Sounds like a fairly extreme pro-monastic position, something a cult leader would say.
[01:22:15] <evolv> to forbid punishment?
[01:22:16] <evolv> lol
[01:22:50] <Ungwelian> "There is nothing outside monastic life, with rules as dictated by me and mine."
[01:23:13] <Ungwelian> Followers love stuff like that, because it hoists them up.
[01:23:15] <evolv> no, the monastic life is punishing for those who don't want to be monks
[01:23:16] <Ungwelian> Puts them on a pedestal.
[01:23:54] <mnemon> evolv: "torture is punishing for those who are not masochists" ;P

[01:25:15] <evolv> oh

[01:25:25] <Ungwelian> Social pressure, social order.

[12:08:22] <amigojapan> thunder: yeah
[12:08:55] <thunder> Ungwelian: honesty stems from fear of the consequences of bad information
[12:09:10] <Ungwelian> That's definitely cynical.
[12:09:23] <thunder> I don't think fear is a bad thing. it protects us from harm, even if it can also be a trickster and lie/exaggerate
[12:09:47] <thunder> it's a messenger speaking of our need for self preservation

[12:10:48] <amigojapan> thunder: I am lying on a futon. Did I say that cause I am afraid of consequences?
[12:10:56] <Digit> "reality is real" is a tricky statement.  ambiguities abound.  does not seem to either negate nor confirm solipsism to me.
[12:11:27] <thunder> people can accept the prevailing social values without giving them much thought, but if you think about the real underlying reason d'etre for those values, it comes back to fear as the initiatory urge

[12:11:58] <Ungwelian> thunder, that may be true for you, but it's not for me.
[12:11:59] <Digit> " honesty stems from fear of the consequences of bad information"   so can dishonesty.   more honesty discernable/derivable from other avenues, i suspect.
[12:12:54] <thunder> fear and desire are intertwined. it's good to consider the flip sides.
[12:13:08] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: fear can also push someone to be dishonest
[12:13:14] <Ungwelian> amigojapan, definitely.

[12:14:05] <Digit> amigojapan: snap.
[12:14:17] <amigojapan> Yup so it's a double edge sword to really on
[12:15:03] <amigojapan> thunder: many time self preservation requires dishonest methods
[12:15:18] <thunder> honesty mainly exists in a social context. it's the fear of the consequences of bad information circulating within the group mind. but sometimes one fear trumps another, and so a person is dishonest for similar reasons
[12:15:49] <Ungwelian> I feel that there's probably a psychology Wikipedia page somewhere, depicting all kinds of motives for action.
[12:15:57] <thunder> like if you robbed someone, and you lie so the group won't find out, because you fear the consequences of their having good information
[12:17:00] <amigojapan> thunder: robbing is but always wrong
[12:17:01] <Digit> that must be a terrible condition to live in... honesty by fear.  not by merit of honesty itself (and/or the positive consequences).   seems very corruptable, manipulable.  very prone to dishonesty too by the same motivation.
[12:17:04] <Ungwelian> Honesty, for example, can be a source of pride. Or there can be a larger, utilitarian motive: betterment of mankind.
[12:17:09] <amigojapan> Not always*
[12:18:46] <thunder> I've not concluded it's universally true as yet, but I'm toying with the premise that fear/desire and it's bodily pain/pleasure equivalents are the underlying pretext for emotion, moral behaviour, etc
[12:18:54] <amigojapan> I am not a believer in utilitarianism
[12:19:12] <Digit> amigojapan: so if i rob a weapon from someone who intended to maim and kill innocents with it out of spite for people of some similar side trait...

[12:21:41] <Ungwelian> Nicest philosopher I've read is probably Mary Midgley. A moral philosopher who had quite a bout with Dawkins :)
[12:21:49] <thunder> when people make decisions to act, there is often a considerable amount of indirection in the reasoning. a lot of the more fundamental prerequisites for decision making are decisions which were already made long ago, and are no longer consciously considered, but remain obscured from view even while they continue to form the basis for decisions
[12:21:53] <Digit> &, i am a big fan of utilitariansim.  maybe not quite as much (or maybe not quite as bluntly/naively) as once was.

[12:44:45] <thunder> I don't feel there's a one-size-fits-all answer. utopias are recipes for totalitarianism
[12:45:17] <Ungwelian> And bought land is immediately used by some evil multinational.
[12:45:39] <thunder> but rather than considering concepts of "ownership" vs "custodianship" internal to a society, it would be better in my mind to merely define territories of the society and let them govern internally however the people there prefer

[12:47:51] <Ungwelian> And what of individual farmers? Some are successful, some aren't. And sometimes not because of individual failure.
[12:48:07] <Ungwelian> Yet this all is: (strongly) agree / disagree.
[12:48:14] <thunder> factory farms are an artefact of consumer behaviour. if the demand for ethical meat production is high enough, that practice will go away. but the problem is that factory farms are more cost competitive, and so the poor majority has little other option but to starve

[12:56:41] <tomathy> a necessary power imbalance?
[12:56:52] <Ungwelian> Because of capitalism we have had massive environmental disasters, plundered countries, masses in poverty & disease, so on.
[12:57:08] <Digit> similar to biological homeostasis, sociological homeostasis likewise needs some flexibility.
[12:57:55] <Ungwelian> Also because of capitalism, we've seen failing healthcare, mass brainwashing, blind consumership, etc.
[12:58:10] <Digit> "capitalism has also brought people out of poverty and raised up entire societies to a high standard of living relatively overnight, without coercion"   HA!!!  lol.  yeah.  if you cherry pick well enough.  XD XD XD

[12:59:39] <thunder> at base, when two parties voluntarily enter into a trade free from fraud, theft and coercion (hence "free trade"), both relinquish something they perceive to have less value than what they receive in return. it's win-win and 100% consensus. the production of new value isn't a physical good/service, but the redistribution of the good/service through voluntary means. it's the most infinitely scalable form of 100% consensus decision making human kind

[13:00:41] <Ungwelian> "All authority should be questioned." <-- intuitively, this would also be an easy yes. Yet, we now have a massive antivaxx movement.
[13:00:52] <Ungwelian> I guess that movement fails to question antivaxx authority, though.
[13:01:03] <thunder> this doesn't only apply to monetary exchanges either, but even applies to charitable acts, where the received good/service is the sense of pride in doing a good thing.
[13:01:12] <Digit> capitalism... most worthy vampire / wealth-extractor, wins... and in that, magically we're all made richer and more free, by encouraging greedy-hostile-acting seen as a virtue, and pay no attention to society, it doesnt exist.  lol/cry/cringe.   so tragic.   takes money to make money, money is power, economic imbalances increase, power is consolidated and centralised among the plutocrats/kleptocrats/plutarchs/kleptarchs/oligarchs.

[13:07:56] <Ungwelian> Digit, I generally agree with that. However, let me tell you a bit of the situation here.
[13:08:54] <Ungwelian> Basically, public healthcare in Finland is severely understaffed and underfunded. It's not uncommon that you have to wait for emergency healthcare for _days_.
[13:09:15] <Ungwelian> Just recently there was a case, where a person waited for emergency healthcare for 3 days.
[13:09:42] <Ungwelian> If you go to the private sector, you get care pretty much immediately.
[13:09:53] * arryana giggles helplessly
[13:10:23] <Ungwelian> Now, it's easy to say that there should be more funds in the public sector. However, that doesn't resolve the real emergencies individuals face _now_.
[13:10:25] <Digit> i recall some leaked middling insider's quip from years ago, that went something like: "when the terrorist thing wears off, we're going to have people running scared of a disease without symptoms."  which coupled with the buying of "no liability", the huge markup, the string of patent frauds on the sars-cov2 viruses at least back to 2002, the captive market, not needing wait for people to be sick to profit from them... just for /some/
[13:10:25] <Digit> of the stink around the dangerous terroristical sell-op.
[13:11:57] <Digit> crooks buying politicians, will indeed be high risk (if not, innevitable), of undermining public services, so they can come in with their "better" offers.   tragic seeing this done to the UK's NHS too, for like 40 years, getting more and more back-door profiteering.
[13:12:18] <Ungwelian> Hmh, you're an antivaxxer?

[13:16:56] <Digit> i remember the one time i accepted their invite to the outrageously dodgy "flu vaccines"... that was the one time i got the flu.  what are the chances.  XD  they suffer the same over-brevity of research and testing time as the current fraudulently depicted "vaccine", albeit there also with a shifting target that's impossible to hit.   idk what the "number to treat" figure for such "vaccines" are, but i know it's not odds i like to

[13:20:34] <Ungwelian> That's definitely a problem nowadays. Corruption of science.

[13:23:04] <Ungwelian> "whereas data for almost all studies published just two years ago were still accessible, the chance of them being so fell by 17% per year. Availability dropped to as little as 20% for research from the early 1990s."

[13:32:51] <thunder> libertarians on both sides, and even conservative right politicians/theorists have proposed variations on a universal basic income, even if formulated as a negative income tax, or such like. in fact if you look at the usa, the lowest 40% of taxpayers receive a net surplus from government sources relative to what they pay in taxes.
[13:33:44] <thunder> which is why corporations are the bulk of government revenue, and thus their focus when making economic decisions
[13:33:58] <Digit> and yet, still pay far higher taxes, as % of income, as the more wealthy (even moderately).
[13:34:30] <thunder> possibly. tax shelters exist. even the poor could use them but for lack of know-how

[13:47:37] <thunder> the fear of jewish bankers goes back 2 millennia. it's been a racist conspiracy theory all along. the great depression in the usa was caused by it, because the federal reserve couldn't convince it's stakeholders to bail out the bank of america (a jewish owned bank), which caused a global run on the banks and economic collapse.

[13:55:05] <thunder> I don't doubt there are some jews (probably zionists) who want world domination, and probably have some kind of messianic fantasy about their being part of a superior race (the chosen people). but the same can be said of nearly any group of people regardless of ethnicity. all that differs is how far along in the project they are.

[16:57:10] <evolv> thunder, ever plague yourself with the possibility that a logical falsity may actually be true?
[16:58:10] <evolv> in terms of the social, I tend to believe "intuition" is more informative than intellect
[16:58:46] <evolv> although that doesn't dismiss intellectual knowledge, especially its utility as a primer
[17:04:55] <thunder> I listen to my intution but attempt to make an informed decision so I know what it is and why I choose to head it
[17:05:18] <thunder> particularly when it impacts major decisions
[17:05:36] <thunder> in a general social context, I can just go with the feeling of the room and not overthink it
[17:06:47] <thunder> my precept of truth is that "doubt is custodian of truth" (in a nutshell). it seems mutually contradictory, but alludes to a process of mixing like pouring a coctail from one glass to the other

[17:11:04] <evolv> the only thing I don't trust is my level of compassion
[17:11:09] <thunder> truth, or meaning, is in my mind a choice of the most similar comparison in a given circumstance. nothing is absolutely true, but always subject to doubt, and vice versa.
[17:11:57] <thunder> as it says in the tao, the tao that can be spoken is not the true tao
[17:12:06] <evolv> if someone does an act, or acts, that is/are wrong, I try not to lose the person by perceiving them as a monster by reconstructing their painful past
[17:12:28] <evolv> developing greater skill in empathy
[17:13:13] <thunder> it's still prudent to be wary of emotional predators
[17:13:49] <thunder> overly empathic/kind people have a tendancy to be taken advantage of if they have too much head in the clouds obscuring the reality
[17:13:58] <evolv> it's cognitive empathy rather than emotional empathy
[17:14:22] <evolv> my emotional empathy is, likely, below average, but maybe by 1 SD
[17:14:53] <evolv> so I rely heavily on cognitive empathy
[17:15:02] <thunder> I believe in reciprocity. not just as a principal, but as a natural law.
[17:15:16] <thunder> so it's prudent to consider all one's actions in that context
[17:15:23] <evolv> I'm working on unlearning reciprocity
[17:15:41] <evolv> compassion should be unconditional
[17:15:50] <thunder> is vs ought
[17:16:37] <evolv> what was learned was never an is, but became one
[17:16:44] <thunder> I agree though. I feel that the existance of suffering compells the moral precept of kindness
[17:16:55] <evolv> thus learning to do the ought, the ought can become the is
[17:17:39] <thunder> ought is the choice of reaction to what is
[17:18:25] <evolv> so "is" is always past tense
[17:18:42] <evolv> from my interpretation of your statement
[17:18:43] <thunder> ought is inherently a future tense
[17:19:00] <thunder> is is present
[17:19:04] <thunder> ought is the future
[17:19:17] <evolv> I understand "is" intends to be the present
[17:19:29] <evolv> by the time it is perceived to make a choice, it is past
[17:19:39] <evolv> that is how it is :P
[17:19:46] <thunder> granted our idea of the present is entwined with the ability to remember the past and thus have a basis for comparison
[17:20:25] <evolv> that is why upon nibbana, there are no more choices

[17:21:37] <thunder> the way I think of it, the conscious observer engages in two basic actions, comparison and choice, between sensations of difference and similarity. past and future are simply this activity applied to the sense of time. but all time occurs in the present, even if our attention is directed towards was or to be.
[17:22:30] <evolv> consciousness precedes sensations
[17:22:43] <thunder> if you have no sensation, how can you be conscious?
[17:22:53] <evolv> mental formations
[17:22:58] <thunder> you sense them
[17:23:18] <thunder> I'm not limiting my conception of senses just to those of the body
[17:23:35] <evolv> I try to work with narrow limitations
[17:23:48] <evolv> which is difficult
[17:24:12] <evolv> in the Buddhist frame work, there are six senses
[17:24:20] <thunder> to me psyche, body, time, space, other, self are the 6 basic kinds of sense. we apply comparison and choice to them to derive the other kinds of senses experienced with and between them.
[17:24:28] <evolv> mind is sixth, but that is the contemplative mind, the intellectual thought
[17:25:12] <evolv> sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, mind
[17:26:08] <evolv> "mind"
[17:26:26] <evolv> but the intellectual thinking aspect of what we generally call the mind
[17:26:46] <thunder> I use the term psyche because it's inclusive of thought and emotion alike, as well as other experiences perhaps not so easily/necessarily pigeonholed into those terms.

[17:34:25] <evolv> interesting question
[17:34:27] <thunder> that's essentially why I regard other and self as senses. they don't necessarily have a fixed boundary, but are to a great extent purely imaginal constructs continguent on the paradigm and form of relationship in question
[17:34:47] <evolv> the pre-requisite condition is the pali "sankhara"
[17:34:57] <evolv> kind of complicated to translate, I've noticed
[17:35:36] <evolv> I prefer "fabrications"
[17:35:48] <thunder> other and self being synonyms for observed and observer
[17:35:49] <evolv> it's volitional, intentional, falls under "choices"
[17:36:51] <thunder> nice. I spend a lot of time mulling over the words I choose to reuse consistently

[17:38:11] <thunder> there're so many synonyms one might choose, but not all have the nuance which arises in the context of other words
[17:38:17] <evolv> paticca samuppada, this provides the context for discussion. This is the Buddhist concept of causation
[17:38:57] <evolv> "Fabrications" precedes "Consciousness"
[17:39:07] <evolv> Sankhara and vinnana, respectively
[17:39:11] <thunder> interesting. my system looks a bit more like a venn diagram

[17:41:32] * arryana does a victory dance at the installed radiator cover
[17:42:58] <thunder> I can't honestly place anything prior to consciousness because I don't have any experience which precedes it to speak of. to me consciousness is at the center of all experience, and to understand the rules by which consciousness operates is the foundational prerequisite to a truthful understanding of the world by which we have awareness.

[18:01:39] <thunder> evolv: just on the basis of it's pattern of operation, it is a confluence and inseperable reciprocity between difference, comparison, similarity and choice. by their shared action, kind becomes sensible, and we thereby derive the kinds of senses: space, time, body, psyche, other, self.
[18:02:24] <thunder> as well as each type of sensation within each (eg. touch vs heat, texture, pressure, etc)

[18:07:43] <ro-bot-o> [url] MN 111 Anupada Sutta | One After Another | www.dhammatalks.org
[18:07:45] <evolv> there are a number of suttas
[18:07:55] <evolv> that one is probably concise and gets to the basics
[18:08:48] *** Quits: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[18:09:06] <evolv> the formless jhanas are not called jhanas in the suttas
[18:09:19] <evolv> so they're there in MN 111 after fourth jhana is mentioned
[18:10:11] <evolv> basically, each jhana factor is the vanishing of something, this is directly related to that image I sent you of paticca samuppada (dependent co-arising AKA dependent origination/arising)
[18:13:28] <evolv> first jhana, there is the vanishing of the social; second, vanishing of any thoughts, thinking
[18:13:47] <thunder> evolv: looking at the wiki page for dhynana buddhism, I find a lot of similarities to my own experience as a meditator. different stages of perspective. the idea of paticca samuppada so far as I superficially grasp the concept, is the same idea I have for kind(ness) and the 6 basic kinds of sensation (I term collectively "custody")
[18:14:21] <thunder> they only exist because the others do, and they each arise because of the others
[18:14:23] <Delf> thunder: You ought to have better reason for being honest
[18:14:47] <evolv> third; intense pleasure vanishes; fourth, no more 6 senses at all
[18:15:41] <thunder> if I've arrived at a decision to be honest, it's not merely because of logic, but because of it's consistency with my emotional disposition.
[18:15:44] <evolv> in the form jhanas, the body is an anchor for awareness
[18:15:51] <Delf> I have had far worse consequences for being honest than not
[18:16:00] <evolv> in the formless, awareness spreads out of the body
[18:16:18] <thunder> pain and pleasure both exist. there's no avoiding it. but we have a choice of which to emphasize and strive to promote vs the other
[18:16:50] <thunder> fear and desire are simply the temporal mental abberations of the here now pain/pleasure experience
[18:16:52] <evolv> thunder, "arising because of the others"
[18:16:54] <Delf> Emotional disposition? Will you elaborate on this?
[18:16:56] <evolv> I got a sutta for that
[18:17:39] <evolv> https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN12_2.html
[18:17:39] <ro-bot-o> [url] SN 12:2 Paṭiccasamuppāda Vibhaṅga Sutta | An Analysis of Dependent Co-arising | www.dhammatalks.org
[18:17:42] <thunder> it fits my values Delf. but sometimes those are situational. I don't feel the need to be honest with those who seek to harm me.
[18:17:54] <thunder> that would be foolish
[18:17:56] <evolv> that above sutta is directly related to the image I linked
[18:18:07] <Ungwelian> Didn't Buddha specifically teach against seeking special powers?
[18:18:14] <Delf> thunder: That is sound logic
[18:18:46] <mannequin> our govt will be debating on putting tax on recreational mj
[18:18:47] <evolv> Ungwelian, no
[18:18:50] <mannequin> we'll see how it goes
[18:18:58] <Ungwelian> IIRR, he did.
[18:19:02] *** Joins: ruzu (~ruzu@107-179-252-71.cpe.teksavvy.com)
[18:19:04] <evolv> Ungwelian, well, sort of. You're not supposed to seek it, but you're also not supposed to fight it
[18:19:12] <thunder> also sometimes others aren't prepared to accept the naked truth, and so it doesn't hurt to offer a placebo or sugar coating to things to avoid unnecessary suffering
[18:19:13] <evolv> if it happens, it happens.
[18:19:20] <Delf> Ungwelian: He said don't pray for me
[18:19:35] <Ungwelian> So many Buddhist practicioners nowadays seek these special consciousness states, mystical realizations, so on.
[18:19:56] <Ungwelian> There's even a named, hierarchical system for them.
[18:20:04] <evolv> the jhanas are required to achieve nibbana, and special consciousness states are not powers
[18:20:06] <Ungwelian> Which functions like an achievement ladder in a video game.
[18:20:11] <Delf> thunder: You must not consider that to be a problem of yours
[18:20:45] <thunder> I don't have a black/white view of it. hasn't been overly problematic that I can say.
[18:20:47] <evolv> also, you don't get mystical realizations from jhanas, you get insight of what is not self
[18:21:11] <evolv> so the best way to really describe what is going on, Ungwelian, is that you're learning to let go, not actually attain
[18:21:21] <Delf> thunder: Someone may consider you an emotionally infant but that does not mean that this is the case. Perhaps you can take an honest answer better than a lie but it is still worth the risk of hurting, nonetheless.
[18:21:33] <evolv> that doesn't stop people trying to attain things with the teachings
[18:21:36] <evolv> but they always fail
[18:22:23] <Ungwelian> "The formless jhānas are related to, or derived from, yogic meditation, while the jhānas proper are related to the cultivation of the mind.
[18:22:24] <Ungwelian> The state of complete dwelling in emptiness is reached when the eighth jhāna is transcended."
[18:22:46] <thunder> Delf: it's not just sparing people's feelings. I mean sometimes people have a conviction which prevents them obtaining the proper help. but there may be work arounds that suit the issue within their current framework of thinking that would at least superficially resolve the issue.
[18:22:50] <Ungwelian> It's a bit ironic in the sense too, that Buddha was specifically against asceticism.
[18:22:57] <evolv> how is it ironic?
[18:22:57] <Ungwelian> Yet now there's ascetic Buddhist orders.
[18:23:14] <evolv> what do you define as "ascetic?"
[18:23:19] <Ungwelian> Lots of people seeking a spiritual detachment from reality.
[18:23:39] <Ungwelian> Typical to religions, there's the profane matter and pure spirit.
[18:23:49] <thunder> anyway, it's easy to theorize what ought to be done in imaginary scenarios. no plan survives the battlefield.
[18:24:07] <evolv> Buddha specifically taught against the teachings of the Vedic group he joined
[18:24:12] <evolv> extreme asceticism
[18:24:19] <Delf> thunder: Even if they're not susceptible... it's still worth it!
[18:24:34] <evolv> causing pain to oneself for spiritual attainments
[18:24:38] <evolv> like extreme starvation
[18:24:55] <evolv> he taught to do just enough to sustain
[18:25:02] * arryana pushes steak, asparagus, and beer over to pussipupu
[18:25:03] <evolv> eat just enough to sustain the body, sleep just enough, etc.
[18:25:45] * pussipupu eats enough to nourish the soul
[18:25:46] <evolv> except refusing food
[18:26:09] * pussipupu offers chocolate-chilli-bang ice cream desert
[18:26:22] <thunder> I saw a documentary the other day that claims the vedas were an import from the yamnaya culture who became the aryan rulers of india. their mythos was later integrated further with hindu themes indigenous to the area.
[18:26:45] <Ungwelian> "Fifth jhāna: infinite space (Pāḷi ākāsānañcāyatana, Skt. ākāśānantyāyatana)" <-- note the extreme language. Infinite.
[18:26:53] <evolv> bhikkhus and bhikkhunis commit an offense by refusing to take food offered (with very few exceptions on food, like specific animals, and if the animal was deliberately killed to feed you)
[18:27:17] <evolv> yeah, it's... formless
[18:27:40] <evolv> basically, first formless jhana should come with the insight that you are not your body
[18:28:14] <arryana> ooooh, ta
[18:28:43] <evolv> in Buddhism, the goal isn't to learn what you are, it's to learn what you are not
[18:29:04] <thunder> Delf: maybe. I'll give it a shot. ever heard of open label placebos?
[18:29:15] <evolv> what you are transcending are your chains
[18:29:23] <Delf> thunder: Never, what is this?
[18:29:48] <Ungwelian> So basically, eschatology to becoming a super-being.
[18:29:50] <thunder> it's where you tell people they're receiving a placebo. apparently they surprisingly still experience the placebo effect.
[18:29:58] <evolv> no

[18:30:45] <Ungwelian> "Freedom from suffering". Isn't that the very goal of the 8FP ?
[18:30:53] <thunder> I haven't set out with that premise as a goal evolv, but a lot of analogous realisations have occurred simply as a consequence of observing things as they are.
[18:31:28] <evolv> is cessation of suffering make someone a super-being, Ungwelian?
[18:31:49] <Ungwelian> I rather like how Kirk put it in Star Trek V:

[18:32:03] <Ungwelian> They're the things we carry with us, the things that make us who we are. If we lose them, we lose ourselves. I don't want my pain taken away! I need my pain!"
[18:32:05] <evolv> thunder, but what does "as they are" really mean?

[18:34:14] <evolv> Ungwelian, that last sentence is good
[18:34:27] <evolv> we often define our "self" by our pain
[18:34:39] <Ungwelian> Don't skip the rest.
[18:34:48] <Ungwelian> Pain can be a great teacher of empathy, for example.
[18:35:08] <Delf> Thanks for the url but I cannot go through that atm
[18:35:14] <evolv> you don't need pain to be compassionate
[18:35:18] <thunder> evolv: underlying language there is a primordial experience, ideally after which language is modelled. that is what I strive to apprehend. from there it becomes a careful selection of language to describe it, ideally forming a simple and nuanced mnemonic unit.
[18:36:15] <evolv> thunder, but it's like your tao quote
[18:36:23] <Ungwelian> Isn't it a scientific truth that generally the better off people are, the less empathy they have for those under them?
[18:36:39] <thunder> Ungwelian: to me what you're describing is kindness. empathy is the mirror sensation of others emotions, rather than our choice of response to it.
[18:36:40] <evolv> no
[18:36:43] <Ungwelian> You know what the other person has been through, is going through.

[18:38:40] <evolv> Ungwelian, I was actually being pedantic with your usage of "scientific truth"
[18:38:41] <thunder> Ungwelian: I find empathy just as often makes people recoil from other people's pain. like when someone is depressed for a long time and you eventually ghost on them because it's too drainning.

[19:13:01] <mannequin> not really
[19:13:03] <evolv> Ungwelian, demonizing personal worth is also a self-view and will prevent nibbana
[19:13:04] <evolv> :)
[19:13:17] <Delf> Why do you really like Quaran?
[19:13:17] <mannequin> i mean
[19:13:29] <mannequin> i fullfilled one filar of Islam
[19:13:31] <Ungwelian> Modern psychotherapy holds up exactly the opposite: a sense of self-worth is important for psychological health.
[19:13:42] <mannequin> but i don't really consider myself a muslim
[19:13:57] <evolv> superior to that is to not be concerned with your own worth
[19:14:08] <Ungwelian> Yet more super-being.
[19:14:25] <mnemon> evolv: have you reached this refined happiness when you pump yourself so full of drugs that you're happy no matter what the conditions are?
[19:14:30] <evolv> not-being, Ungwelian
[19:14:42] <Delf> To not be concerned with your own worth does not say whether or not you have high or low sense of self worth
[19:14:44] <mannequin> one day
[19:14:47] <mannequin> i was sleeping
[19:14:50] <evolv> mnemon, drugs would be a condition
[19:15:01] <mannequin> and i felt such happiness and extasy

[19:15:11] <mannequin> that it woken me up
[19:15:18] <Ungwelian> --> obfuscation of language. Another religious quality.
[19:15:27] <mannequin> so this chills me out
[19:15:33] <evolv> lol
[19:15:38] <evolv> it's not an obfuscation of language
[19:15:50] <evolv> there is nothing real about words

[19:16:32] <mnemon> of course it's limited in temporal sense at it is restricted by other realistic limitations
[19:16:42] <evolv> this is why great effort is taken to set a definition of a word in order for the technical word to be understood
[19:16:58] <mnemon> the ideal you posited is not mainly because it is that, an ideal with no realistic constraints
[19:17:07] <Delf> mannequin: That is something within you, not to credit quaran for
[19:17:23] <evolv> and that relies on the receiver of the word to have any understanding of the signified
[19:17:26] <mannequin> that's something about God, not Quaran
[19:17:43] <mannequin> in that dream i've experienced an astral journey
[19:18:08] <mannequin> i left my body and traveled to a place where ultimate happiness exists
[19:18:12] <Delf> Not to be credited god for...
[19:18:34] <evolv> mnemon, it may not take a lifetime to achieve nibbana
[19:18:40] <mannequin> next one hour i still was extremly happy
[19:18:48] <mannequin> i felt incredible
[19:18:53] <Delf> Listen mate, if you want to start crediting god then the least you can do is be fair. And if I weigh the shit vs the goods, the shits outweigh the goods.
[19:19:02] <mnemon> Ungwelian: sometimes it is intentional obfuscation to sound profound but other times the concepts simply cannot be expressed by more conventional language in suitably brief form
[19:19:32] <mnemon> evolv: whether it takes a second or a lifetime does not really matter for the argument
[19:19:53] <evolv> if I actually talked about the biology I did and used the technical terms I had to use without very, very long explanations
[19:20:02] <mnemon> it is still a necessary mechanism to achieve the state in question
[19:20:03] <mannequin> Delf: i don't know who was responsible for this but it was hard to describe

[19:25:15] <evolv> mnemon, the only way to know is to do. But if you don't believe it's even possible, then consider other benefits of the teachings that can reduce stress. If you don't believe the teachings can reduce stress, then whatever

[19:26:01] <Ungwelian> Delf, clearly cats are your spirit animal :)
[19:26:08] <evolv> if you have an ideal of the ultimate goal
[19:26:19] <evolv> and that ideal may actually be impossible
[19:26:36] <evolv> is it still not worth chasing if there are guaranteed fruits from the effort along the path?
[19:26:52] <mnemon> but holding uncomprehending bliss as the ideal doesn't seem very desirable for me
[19:27:04] <arryana> wow, sense in this channel
[19:27:09] <arryana> thanks, mnemon
[19:27:36] <evolv> I don't think bliss is the ideal
[19:27:41] <evolv> it's the end of suffering
[19:27:47] <mnemon> np I guess? :D

[19:31:48] <evolv> medicine is not forbidden in Buddhism
[19:32:26] <Ungwelian> mnemon, not a fan of surgeon general's recommendations, are you? :P

[19:32:46] <mnemon> Ungwelian: those are probably ways to avoid specific known problems

[19:33:02] <evolv> why?
[19:33:15] <Ungwelian> But yeah, of course nowadays a lot of medicine is about putting you in a neat little box, giving you a specific scan, then a standard treatment.
[19:33:16] <Delf> mannequin: Me neither!
[19:33:26] <evolv> yes, Ungwelian
[19:33:29] <evolv> monks do that
[19:33:32] <evolv> including abbots
[19:33:38] <Ungwelian> evolv, you yourself said that they don't even grow their own food.
[19:34:01] <Ungwelian> Food is pretty important for healthy life.
[19:34:01] <evolv> they're not creating food in their own bodies
[19:34:22] <evolv> they literally beg for food
[19:34:25] <evolv> it's called "alms"
[19:34:48] <evolv> it's meant for humility, to be in touch with laypeople, to experience their compassion
[19:35:20] <evolv> thus, a monk is at the mercy of the lay community
[19:35:48] <Ungwelian> And is that a realistic model lifestyle for sustainable happiness?
[19:35:59] <evolv> yep
[19:36:37] <Ungwelian> There's various qualities to food too.
[19:36:41] <evolv> otherwise all Buddhist monastics would be pretty miserable
[19:36:49] <evolv> here's a fun fact
[19:36:52] <evolv> so on alms round
[19:36:58] <evolv> the food goes in a bowl
[19:37:02] <Ungwelian> You can't just eat whatever and stamp it with ascetic approval.
[19:37:05] * arryana digs through junk for an hdmi adaptor
[19:37:08] <evolv> after your bowl is filled
[19:37:11] <evolv> you go away
[19:37:14] <evolv> and mash everything together
[19:37:23] <evolv> then eat the mashed gunk
[19:37:24] <evolv> lol
[19:37:36] <Ungwelian> Sounds like what a lot of teenagers do.
[19:37:59] <evolv> the reason is to not get hooked on the sensual pleasure of taste
[19:38:14] <evolv> then be consumed with the desire
[19:38:20] <Ungwelian> Demonization of worldly pleasures.
[19:38:35] <mnemon> Ungwelian: slotting people into the right boxes enables correct fixes for known problems
[19:38:50] <evolv> it's not a demonization
[19:38:53] <mnemon> unfortunately doctors are not omniscient so mistakes are bound to happen

[19:39:11] <Ungwelian> "This is the road to happiness: you must not enjoy your food."
[19:39:19] <evolv> it's a rejection of worldly pleasures
[19:39:28] <Ungwelian> Yep. Spiritual asceticism.
[19:39:45] <evolv> so if it is demonization
[19:39:55] <evolv> then is enjoying food glorification?
[19:39:58] <evolv> divine?
[19:40:31] <Ungwelian> There's nothing wrong with enjoying good food.
[19:40:33] <evolv> if monks are invited for dinner at someone's house, they can't mash the food, btw
[19:40:36] <evolv> they have to eat it as is
[19:40:40] <evolv> so there's that
[19:40:46] <evolv> so demonization of rudeness
[19:40:49] <evolv> lol
[19:41:21] <Ungwelian> Lots of other pleasures in life, too, and it's quite ok that people enjoy them.

[19:41:38] <evolv> that's on you

[20:08:04] <Ungwelian> "Under the Vinaya, the cleric structure should be egalitarian and the decision-making should be communal, open and participatory to prevent abuse of authority.
[20:08:10] <Ungwelian> The clergy, however, has now become an autocracy with a feudal hierarchy that commands total submission from junior members.

[20:25:45] <evolv> chlorine, no

[20:26:56] <evolv> Ungwelian, the Theravada school does not have a leader, it is not organized in a hierarchy

[20:27:15] <evolv> however
[20:27:19] <chlorine> evolv: i mean it's nothing specific to Theravada Buddhism.
[20:27:33] <evolv> countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka have intertwined Theravada and government
[20:27:41] <evolv> which is stupid, but such is this
[20:28:03] <chlorine> as far as i'm aware, similar is the situation with Catholic priests.
[20:28:18] <chlorine> it's certainly not institutional, but present nonetheless.
[20:28:27] <evolv> chlorine, I don't know anything about the Mahayana school and their traditions
[20:28:29] <mnemon> anyways, the article basically makes the same complaints as evolv, namely the monasteries being too lax in their adherence to the codes
[20:28:49] <evolv> chlorine, although Tibetan Buddhist monks must take a vow of celibacy as well
[20:28:55] <Ungwelian> Rather than this ancient rule of celibacy, it'd be far better to have real, humane guidelines for sexuality.
[20:29:14] <Ungwelian> Per human rights, psychological and medical knowledge.
[20:29:20] <chlorine> evolv: i think Vajrayana are known for their magical sex rituals.
[20:29:21] <mnemon> Ungwelian: are you in favor of banning voluntary celibacy?
[20:29:41] <chlorine> Ungwelian: i think people who decide to become monks don't understand this requirement properly.
[20:29:57] <evolv> mnemon, Ungwelian is making the implicit argument that monasticism invariably leads to corruption and invites unquestioning, unpunished harm
[20:30:04] <Ungwelian> mnemon, is that an attempt to misrepresent now? What do you even mean with banning voluntary celibacy ?

[20:30:20] <evolv> chlorine, I never heard such a thing
[20:30:41] <chlorine> evolv: they live in Tibet.
[20:30:50] <evolv> Ungwelian, joining a monastery is voluntary
[20:30:52] <evolv> thus
[20:30:58] <evolv> celibacy is voluntary
[20:31:12] <mnemon> let me rephrase, banning voluntary celibacy as a guideline for some ideology
[20:31:49] <Ungwelian> How is it voluntary, if it's part of an organized ideology?
[20:31:55] <chlorine> lifelong celibacy could be depressing, i suppose. only very great men could bear the burden.
[20:31:59] <mnemon> adhering to the ideology is voluntary
[20:32:06] <evolv> because there is no requirement to join a monastery, Ungwelian
[20:32:30] <mnemon> nor stay there once ordained
[20:32:35] <evolv> correct
[20:32:35] <chlorine> Ungwelian: there's a near ban on voluntary celibacy in Islam and Zoroastrianism.
[20:32:38] <Ungwelian> You have the ideology as a social order. Even in those articles, wasn't it mentioned that parents force kids to these monasteries?
[20:32:42] <evolv> in fact, there is nothing wrong with disrobing
[20:33:02] <evolv> there is no official rule about reordaining, but the general rule among monasteries is that you only only ordain 7 times
[20:33:17] <mannequin> go to hell
[20:33:17] <evolv> I mean, after 7, maybe you don't really want to be a monastic
[20:33:34] <Ungwelian> Spending time in the monasteries has become about status and other things.
[20:33:36] <chlorine> evolv: it's like appearing for a bar exam.
[20:33:40] <mnemon> Ungwelian: kids get sent there, yes. I didn't spot anything about being forced to stay there after
[20:33:41] <chlorine> Ungwelian: correct!
[20:34:15] <mnemon> not sure how free the kids are to leave as such though?
[20:34:25] <evolv> Ungwelian, Theravada monasteries exist outside of Thailand
[20:34:41] <Ungwelian> Sure, sure.
[20:34:44] <mnemon> as in, what kind of guardianship rules exist
[20:34:49] <chlorine> mnemon: it's not about freedom. even if they can leave technically, it might be a social taboo.
[20:34:52] <evolv> kids cannot stay in monasteries permanently
[20:35:01] <evolv> you have to be an adult to ordain
[20:35:25] <mnemon> chlorine: it's probably a practical obstacle, alternative being a street rat
[20:35:36] <chlorine> mnemon: maybe like staying unemployed and with parents is in America?
[20:35:55] <chlorine> mnemon: you can do it, but with only with significant social costs.
[20:36:03] <chlorine> s/with only/only/
[20:36:03] <ro-bot-o> chlorine meant to say: mnemon: you can do it, but only with significant social costs.
[20:36:19] <mnemon> staying there seems analoguous to that :3
[20:36:24] <chlorine> mnemon: it's not.
[20:36:36] <evolv> Ungwelian, Theravada isn't a government nor a culture
[20:36:37] <chlorine> mnemon: being a monk is a big deal.
[20:36:37] <mnemon> unemployed and with parents(monastery)
[20:36:49] <chlorine> mnemon: it's a completely different dynamic.
[20:37:06] <mnemon> might involve more expectations usually
[20:37:10] <chlorine> mnemon: no.
[20:37:30] <chlorine> mnemon: it's a status thing. very high moral ground.
[20:37:38] <evolv> it is a status thing
[20:37:40] <chlorine> mnemon: you lose than when you leave. it's very depressing.
[20:37:53] <chlorine> mnemon: you probably won't understand.
[20:37:58] <mnemon> I'm thinking more about the practical alternative being homelessness
[20:38:01] <evolv> as with anything, once something becomes a cultural phenomenon, all bets are off about the intent
[20:38:07] <chlorine> mnemon: i don't think America has anything like that.
[20:38:08] <mnemon> I do have an inkling
[20:38:33] <chlorine> mnemon: no. the conditions in a monastery are generally quite good, except for the warmth.
[20:38:48] <mnemon> yes? that was the point
[20:39:10] <mnemon> the alternative(aka. if one leaves the monastery) is destitution, homelessness, etc.
[20:39:10] <chlorine> mnemon: no, i mean psychologically too.
[20:39:22] <evolv> mnemon, not really
[20:39:41] <chlorine> mnemon: as far as i know, no monks are depressed playing video games in the basement due to lack of sex.
[20:39:56] <chlorine> mnemon: it's a completely different dynamic.
[20:39:58] <evolv> mnemon, it's extremely common for monks to disrobe
[20:40:10] <mnemon> evolv: talking about the kiddos
[20:40:23] <mnemon> many of whom are orphans and the like
[20:40:28] <evolv> kids don't get a choice anywhere in the world
[20:40:31] <chlorine> mnemon: if one leaves the monastery, they would be financially well-off.
[20:40:40] <chlorine> mnemon: just that the parents and peers might oppose it.

[20:42:00] <evolv> hell, even being thrown in any school with strangers teaching them
[20:42:14] <mnemon> evolv: this seems to include both sex deconditioning, sunday school and fat camp aspects all in one
[20:42:40] <evolv> chlorine, the idea is that kids just don't get a choice
[20:42:48] <evolv> well meaning parents aside
[20:43:09] <chlorine> evolv: nobody gets a choice. do you think the adults are free.
[20:43:14] <evolv> mnemon, I don't agree with forcing religion on kids
[20:43:21] <evolv> or anything
[20:43:38] <mnemon> evolv: making them become monks kinda qualifies

[20:44:35] <evolv> or whether you think this required under Theravada
[20:44:57] <mnemon> evolv: they are not required to learn the tenents in the monastery?
[20:45:38] <chlorine> i like Theravada Buddhism.
[20:45:42] <evolv> mnemon, there is no requirement to convert children in the suttas nor vinaya
[20:46:05] <evolv> there is no conversion requirement

[22:00:10] <chlorine> evolv: what's it called?
[22:00:37] <evolv> male monastics were bhikkhus, female: bhikkhunis
[22:01:08] <Ungwelian> IIRR, the monastic code for women practicioners is much stricter than for men.
[22:01:13] <evolv> correct

[22:01:18] <chlorine> evolv: is it/
[22:01:22] <chlorine> evolv: ?
[22:01:36] <Ungwelian> And there has been plenty of allegations of sexism regarding the monastic code.
[22:01:39] <evolv> nobody really knows why the bhikkhuni order was unfairly more strict
[22:01:48] <evolv> but it's definitely sexist
[22:02:01] <chlorine> evolv: what's so difficult about being a woman monk?
[22:02:18] <chlorine> evolv: are they not allowed sex too?
[22:02:33] <evolv> chlorine, regardless of years as a monastic, they still were below novice bhikkhus, for one
[22:02:47] <chlorine> evolv: sheeet.
[22:02:53] <evolv> women had all the same rules as men plus additional rules

[22:04:00] <ro-bot-o> [url] Eight Garudhammas - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[22:04:14] <Ungwelian> "(1) A nun who has been ordained even for a hundred years must greet respectfully, rise up from her seat, salute with joined palms, do proper homage to a monk ordained but that day."
[22:04:22] <chlorine> evolv: i'm sure Theravada can't be the worst. Jainism doesn't allow nibbana for women.
[22:04:33] <chlorine> Ungwelian: that sucks.
[22:04:47] <chlorine> evolv: whatever their equivalent is for nibbana.
[22:04:53] <chlorine> evolv: the smaller school i mean.
[22:05:22] <Ungwelian> "(8) From today, admonition of monks by nuns is forbidden. [Book of the Discipline, V.354-355]"
[22:05:26] <evolv> theories range from backlash by both the lay community and by lesser bhikkhus to outright tampering with the text
[22:05:36] <chlorine> Ungwelian: if i was a woman monk, i won't show respect to the newbies at all. i'd be like the convent teachers and beat them with sticks for mistakes.
[22:05:50] <evolv> the latter is very likely because there are suttas clearly added later in the sutta pitaka
[22:05:54] <Ungwelian> Maybe better not to beat anyone with sticks :P
[22:06:11] <I_Am_M00t> what if it feels good
[22:06:25] <chlorine> evolv: don't worry. we get it. you don't have to explain it away.
[22:06:44] <I_Am_M00t> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[22:07:01] <chlorine> evolv: i don't judge you for being a monk when Buddha may have been less charitable towards women from 21st century conceptions.
[22:07:06] <evolv> I'm not a monk
[22:07:25] <chlorine> evolv: student?
[22:07:30] <Ungwelian> "(2) A nun must not spend the rains (vassa, 3 months rainy season retreat) in a residence where there are no monks." <-- pretty interesting too
[22:07:32] <evolv> I'm a lay Theravadin
[22:07:47] <chlorine> evolv: the point is, you don't have to be an apologist either. you're not a missionary.
[22:07:53] <evolv> Ungwelian, that might actually be because of incidents of rape by lay men
[22:08:33] <evolv> chlorine, Buddha being sexist is inconsistent with his actually teachings
[22:08:38] <chlorine> evolv: i'm a muslim. i don't care whenever people project their western sensibilities on 7th century arabia and muhammad. just chill.
[22:08:41] <evolv> so how do we resolve the contradiction?
[22:08:45] <Delf> Who wrote these rules?
[22:09:11] <chlorine> evolv: lol, he wasn't sexist at all. that's impossible because sexism is invented in 19th century.
[22:09:13] <evolv> presumably monks did during Asoka
[22:09:21] <evolv> 100 years after Buddha's death
[22:09:44] <evolv> chlorine, he addressed sexist attitudes in the suttas
[22:09:50] <evolv> and classism (castes)
[22:10:01] <Ungwelian> India is a sexist country. And it was definitely even more sexist then.
[22:10:22] <Ungwelian> It's the country where wives were burned alive when the husband died.
[22:10:25] <chlorine> evolv: i don't care if he did. Buddha was Buddha. he doesn't need to confirm to sexism related sensibilities of the now.
[22:11:01] <chlorine> Ungwelian: i don't know how a country can be sexist.
[22:11:19] <Delf> chlorine: Why are you a muslim?
[22:11:24] <evolv> given that the dhamma teaches there are no humans incapable of nibbana, that necessarily means no differences between men and women
[22:11:32] <chlorine> Delf: coz i was born a muslim.
[22:11:56] <Delf> chlorine: How does one get born muslim?
[22:12:10] <Delf> I thought we are born without any religious affiliations
[22:12:32] <chlorine> Delf: when i was born, there came a facsimile from heaven stating that this kid is muslim. my parents being muslims also played a part in that probably.

[22:13:42] <evolv> "nobody talks about"

[22:13:51] <chlorine> Ungwelian: well, i think the monks would get aroused pretty quickly.

[22:16:09] <Ungwelian> "The texts repeatedly describe celibate monks as embodiments of dhamma (the path of enlightenment) while the lustful insatiable women are described as embodiments of samsara (the cycle of death and rebirths)."
