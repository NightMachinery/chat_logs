[02:57:21] <anovick> somiaj: were you able to identify the shape based on the formula? also, I am not sure what 3D parabola means. in 2D (plane) I know that the vertex of parabola is a point and I have a formula to find it: X_v = -b/2a . I am not sure what vertex is in 3D nor how to calculate its locations
[02:57:44] <somiaj> Yea, it is of the form ax^2 + by^2 + cxy + dx + ey + f
[02:58:01] <somiaj> simlar to ax^2 + bx + c for 2D
[02:58:58] <somiaj> look up paraboloid for some pictures
[02:59:16] <anovick> ok
[02:59:30] <anovick> it looks like a deep bowl
[02:59:56] <anovick> I think the vertex for it is also a point, right?
[03:00:14] <anovick> well
[03:00:25] <anovick> I think sometimes the vertex can be multiple points
[03:00:42] <somiaj> correct, so solve dz/dx =0 and dz/dy = 0, then use that (x,y) point to compute z, that will be the minimum value of that expression
[03:01:02] <cherim> Or saddle point...
[03:01:23] <somiaj>  in this case it is a minimum because the x^2 and y^2 coefficents are positive
[03:01:38] <cherim> What about x^2+y^2 +10000xy?
[03:01:39] <anovick> but can't you have multiple minimum points for the paraboloid?
[03:01:51] <anovick> when I think about a deep bowl that is flat at the bottom
[03:04:00] <cherim> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%27s_criterion is the proper way
[03:04:22] <cherim> Or you can cast your quadratic form to the normal form by hand
[03:05:30] <cherim> If you only need to show it doesn't take negative values, here it suffices to use Cauchy, 5x^2 + y^2 >=2sqrt(5) |x||y| and that dominates the xy part
[03:05:37] <anovick> cherim: wow! cool criterion
[03:06:08] <cherim> In all cases it's about checking which of ab or c^2 is bigger in ax^2 + by^2 + 2cxy

[08:28:53] <kakuhen> I'm able to do lots of math, but I just suck at physics
[08:29:39] <motle> well, i cant do either at all
[08:30:06] <kakuhen> the only class I nearly failed in undergrad was some required physics class
[08:30:22] <motle> wheres the irc for mathematical physics lol
[08:30:22] <kakuhen> but im somehow okay with bits of modular representation theory
[08:30:33] <kakuhen> motle: I'd recommend asking on physics stackexchange or somewhere
[08:30:47] <kakuhen> but they tend to be very antsy about "homework questions," so make sure you dont format it like one
[08:31:03] <motle> id count that as a pottential hack in terms of advise and so am wary of such
[08:31:19] <alphamule> What's interesting is this question:  How much of an effect does the weak force have on chemistry (of interatomic, not nuclear)
[08:31:59] <alphamule> 20th Century Problems for $1000
[08:32:02] <motle> ill wait for people that can demonstrate they have suffient technical skill to be more understandingly able to respond adiquately
[08:32:18] <kakuhen> motle: you're going to have a hard time finding much people without a bias towards computer subjects on IRC -- I'd be surprised if you could find a theoretical physics channel here or on any other network, especially one with activity
[08:32:22] <alphamule> What is, not much?
[08:32:23] <alphamule> :D

[09:21:52] <motle> yeah, we have been struggling with pottentials that contain poles from the perspective of RG flow, and desire a bluderd instead of dirac delta support for the matter fields, however need to adjust the lorentz covariance
[09:21:52] <DrJaneyDoe> the whole concept of quantum numbers in an electron orbital can be deduced from it

[09:22:21] <motle> well, only if you can tractably perform the diagramatic counting
[09:22:40] <motle> where the poles make it difficult to renormalize
[09:22:48] <motle> the difficulty being to do with integrability
[09:23:08] <motle> where then we get to solitons

[09:26:28] <motle> so needs a new d_mu
[09:26:47] <motle> connection via lie algebra, cartan killing etc
[09:27:26] <motle> the stuff we were doing before about covering orbits was to do with dynamical system factorization and disentanglement
[09:28:01] <motle> and now we want some massive kind of dirac equation in many variables to encode chemical complexity directly
[09:28:26] <motle> this being a less "sloppy" model, ie being better for tuning to have the observed chemical interactions
[09:29:21] <motle> the stuff with the stadium and the ergodic scarring *could* be related to surface curvature i suppose
[09:29:27] <motle> but thats getting more complicated
[09:29:44] <DrJaneyDoe> the actual answer lies in information theory, a pure information theoretic description of the atom: the "missing" information corresponds to the "holes" or regions of zero probability density in the classical theories when you encode this information geometrically.
[09:29:53] <DrJaneyDoe> electrojns DO NOT orbit around an atom
[09:30:08] <DrJaneyDoe> they ARE the atom, theyre regions where the atom is emitting the most information
[09:30:43] <motle> that doesnt even attempt to explain the pauli exclusion principle
[09:30:52] <motle> whats a fermion in that perspective?
[09:31:23] <motle> these are support sets - and should not even at first approximation be evolved in time where they can do things like radiating information
[09:31:44] <motle> which of course would explain how they end up in the lowest energy states if we have something like friction from mode mixing
[09:32:28] <motle> but, things with poles everywhere are bad support sets, so then we have multipole expansions

[09:35:24] <DrJaneyDoe> motle: pauli exclusion principle would be translated in information theoretic terms as "orbitals are themselves elementary particles"
[09:35:30] <DrJaneyDoe> they cannot be broken down further
[09:35:34] <motle> and mixing up dynamical automita with supprt sets is making me anxious
[09:35:49] <DrJaneyDoe> theyre the fundamental components in the information theoretic model
[09:35:52] <DrJaneyDoe> and are functional
[09:36:11] <DrJaneyDoe> whereas electrons and fermions are the fundamental units in classical models
[09:36:22] <motle> but why would they have binary occupation only?
[09:36:36] <motle> my support sets im used to giving arbitrary weighting
[09:36:44] <DrJaneyDoe> because information is fundamnetally binary
[09:36:46] <DrJaneyDoe> on a physical level
[09:36:49] <DrJaneyDoe> when you store it
[09:36:49] <motle> i guess that would mess up the chemical properties if it wasnt quantized like that

[10:11:27] *** Joins: amanr_ (~amanr@20.204.87.0)
[10:11:46] <motle> so the topological localization on the sparse covering is encoded there as the sheaf in the stack
[10:12:11] <motle> so we got all the cat stuff down too, with the ends of the learning paths etc. too
[10:12:12] <DrJaneyDoe> true
[10:12:49] <DrJaneyDoe> you can actually measure in bytes how much mathematical knowledge we've accumulated by looking at Wikipedia
[10:12:53] <DrJaneyDoe> it isn't that much
[10:13:03] <DrJaneyDoe> a few megabytes or even kilobytes after compression
[10:13:04] <motle> big spin bonding however... not at the diagramatic counting being anayltically tractable via integrable systems / solitons
[10:13:08] <DrJaneyDoe> removing the big overlaps
[10:13:28] <DrJaneyDoe> if you were to encode raw concepts somehow itd be a couple hundred bytes at most
[10:13:45] <motle> well, i have haskell code for the deep cyclic structure
[10:13:53] <motle> but the group theoretic stuff not so much
[10:14:04] <motle> not understanding it at all
[10:14:29] <motle> something to do with brading, but i think its hidden in string theory, and im gonna lose the whole channel
[10:15:15] <alphamule> I think that level of compression is optimistic :)
[10:15:44] <motle> mad actions and soft balls of fuzzy particles in string scattering diagrams...
[10:15:57] <alphamule> Interestingly, there are archives of the entire Wikipedia site that are around 70GB
[10:16:22] <motle> yeah but people can say stuff though right

[10:17:48] <motle> leadership vs observational simplifications as a model order reduction process people do quite well
[10:18:39] <motle> ie optimal policy design via elucidation as opposed to just being bossy...
[10:20:12] <motle> net (co)compression is its simplest guise
[10:20:55] <motle> which is why peoples understanding, as opposed to any other direction, is particularly valuable
[10:21:11] <motle> because being able to say it means something
[10:21:20] <motle> or something like that...
[10:22:40] <motle> neuroscience even has thoughts as quaziparticles interacting with with sensed experience
[10:22:53] <motle> thinking how they have stacks in altered carbon
[10:23:44] <motle> peer review can check my references on that! weirdly...
[10:25:06] <motle> publication issues, going to watch netflix. ciao
[10:25:25] <DrJaneyDoe> its no coincidence we use terms like thought "process" and chemical "process" to describe what we know intuitively to be the same process. most peoples minds are experienced as a "chain reaction" of thoughts leading to other thoughts, not some rule-based process like described in maths or physics. it's likely chemistrey is fundamental to consciousness and perhaps the rules of thoughts
[10:26:23] <motle> all i care about is if the taught structure of matter is wrong. brain plasticity is actually a pretty good example
[10:26:25] <DrJaneyDoe> our thoughts bond with other thoughts and emotions to produce more thoughts and emotions in an endless reaction
[10:26:49] <int-e> now wtf has that to do with math
[10:27:13] <motle> the point is that the ball and stick models of mollecules is a "sloppy model" not storing the information from the quantum level in a representative way
[10:28:10] <motle> int-e: its just the same thing at various length scales observed in reality, the maths undelying it should basically be somehow seperated from all such examples - but net compression seems a bit drab perhaps
[10:28:28] <motle> "oversimplification"
[10:29:06] <motle> pushing the resolution of nonlinear model reduction, probably better
[10:30:11] <motle> "sloppyness" is actually a math term too, something like "bad surrogate"
[10:30:37] <motle> so we want the nice weyl-braur representation to avoid such wrong models
[10:30:55] <motle> right right, watching tv

[19:02:02] <taeaad> You have Aut(E/F) = the "galois group" of E/F, the extension of E over F. Aut(E/F) is isomorphisms of E such that i(x) = x for all x in E. I just checked Wikipedia to refresh my memory.

[19:08:35] <laurus> Z-module: for example, I have little intuition about what is connected and what isn't. right now I have a hunch that if A is connected, then the closure of A must also be connected, but I don't see a way to show that in general.
[19:09:48] <laurus> The only theorem I seem to be able to use to show these things in general is one that says that a set is connected if and only if (if a characteristic function on the set is continuous then it is constant)
[19:10:46] <laurus> (the definition of connectedness seems too vague to be useful a lot of the time. it has two equivalent statements and both are something like "A is connected if it is impossible to find <some type of set>"
[19:10:56] <laurus> So that definition seems more useful for showing that something is _not_ connected.

[19:13:01] <Z-module> laurus, yeah, in fact if A is any connected subset of X, then for all B with  A \subset B \subset closure(A),  B is also connected.
[19:13:08] <Z-module> including when B is the full closure
[19:13:19] <laurus> Z-module: that is what the problem I'm doing asks me to show
[19:13:20] <laurus> :)
[19:13:44] <Z-module> and yes, quite often you prove connectedness by showing the contrapositive
[19:14:01] <Z-module> which then deals with two disjoint nonempty open sets, typically
[19:14:47] <taeaad> Z-module: laurus: What is the subject? In general topology the argument should be quite different, but this is all assuming a metric on it?
[19:14:52] <laurus> Z-module: So, (i) says "A is connected if and only if it is impossible to find nonempty sets A_1, A_2 such that..."
[19:15:09] <laurus> Z-module: So the contrapositive of that would show that something is not connected
[19:15:09] <Z-module> (this is true in the totally general setting, metrizable not assumed)
[19:15:21] <laurus> taeaad: This is for metric spaces specifically
[19:15:32] <taeaad> In general topology: (X,T) disconnect implies X = U join V, U,V open in T.
[19:15:37] <Z-module> it's sometimes easier in the metric case
[19:15:39] <laurus> Z-module: so what is the intiution for the closure of a connected set A being connected?
[19:16:06] <laurus> I guess my intuition is something like, the limit points are really close to the set itself which are connected
[19:16:11] <laurus> *is connected
[19:16:40] <taeaad> implies should be if and only if in my statement
[19:16:48] <laurus> But to show that closure(A) is connected I have to use one of the theorems in this section. The only one I have found useful in these abstract situations is the one about continuous characteristic functions
[19:16:53] <Z-module> yes, a limit point of B that's not already in B is points of B arbitrarily close to it

[19:17:56] <laurus> Z-module: I often try using extensions or restrictions of characteristic functions but that doesn't work well.
[19:18:06] <taeaad> What are characteristic functions here?
[19:18:31] <laurus> taeaad: For example say chi_W: C -> {0, 1} where C is a connected set. If chi is continuous then chi must be either 0 or 1 on C.
[19:18:35] <laurus> (by a theorem)
[19:18:46] <Franciman> I am astonished by the usefulness of characteristic functions

[19:19:08] <Franciman> not christian :P
[19:19:13] <laurus> But restricting that to a non-connected set doesn't really show anything, because it's possible to make a continuous characteristic function on a disconnected subset B of C that is _not_ constant
[19:19:13] <Z-module> the char. function thing is only a very mild recasting of the definition of a disconnection.  The char. function's codomain is the discrete space {0,1}, so if a continuous char. function chi is surjective, then chi^-1({0}), chi^-1({1}) are nonempty disjoint open subsets of the domain whose union is the whole domain.
[19:19:37] <biberao> hi
[19:19:52] <laurus> Z-module: I see
[19:20:34] <taeaad> laurus: Oh, nice, it uses 2... A nice kind of set. But you force the connected topology on it, otherwise all functions into it are continuous.
[19:20:53] <laurus> taeaad: Unfortunately I know nothing about general topology:(
[19:21:03] <taeaad> Uh wait, no that last thing I said is wrong.
[19:22:01] <Z-module> For this thing about sets between A and closure(A) also being connected, I'm really not convinced the metric context makes it any easier.
[19:22:15] <taeaad> If you use the disconnected topology on 2, then a function into it is continuous iff the domain has a disconnected topology. Since f^-1{0} and f^-2{1} both need to be open and span the domain.

[19:26:20] <Z-module> laurus: the crux of what you do for this is that if z is a limit point of A and z is not in A, then every open set around z contains at least one point of A.  The open sets you'll deal with are just  chi_B^-1({0}) and chi_B^-1({1})  where B is your intermediate set that you assume is disconnected, to get a contradiction of A being connected.  Remember that the restriction of any continuous function to any subset of the domain is still

[20:08:30] <HisShadow> you have 2 planes instead of that
[20:08:48] <biberao> thats how we're taught to solve
[20:09:05] <biberao> HisShadow: https://youtu.be/JNZst8SS8yk?t=681
[20:10:12] <HisShadow> biberao: anyway (2, 0, 2) is incorrect, y can be anything since it's not constrained by the 2 equations, but your vector's second component is 0, y doesn't change
[20:10:33] <biberao> so the guys solves its wrong?

[20:11:04] <biberao> i dont understand how x+5=0 becomes y+5=0
[20:11:33] <HisShadow> neither do I
[20:11:45] <Franciman> you do var substitution?
[20:11:48] <Franciman> x = y
[20:12:09] <biberao> Franciman: but why?
[20:13:08] <biberao> HisShadow: how would you solve it?
[20:14:47] <HisShadow> okay, if his result is this, then the line equation is l: (-5/2, -5, 0) + t * (2, 0, 2). let's take t = 1: that gives (-1/2, -5, 2) which does not satisfy the equation x + 5 = 0
[20:15:42] <cherim> x+5=0 is not the same as y+5=0, why go deeper
[20:16:16] <cherim> Just wrong in the video in his first try. Later he does it correctly it seems
[20:16:46] <biberao> im either going blind
[20:16:51] <biberao> but where does it correct it?
[20:16:51] <biberao> lol
[20:16:57] <HisShadow> biberao: I told you how to solve it. You let y = t, then x = -5 + 0 * t and y = 0 + 1 * t and z = -2.5 + 0 * t, so here's your point and vector right there

[21:53:32] <int-e> You're describing lines in the plane, aren't you?
[21:54:37] <int-e> So there are several ways to do that; common ones are by slope and y-intercept (which fails for vertical lines), the implicit form ax+bx+c = 0, by specifying two points, or by specifying a point and a direction (which is a vector).
[21:55:39] <taeaad> Right.

[22:01:30] <taeaad> Oh that's just playing with coefficients and moving over. But this example is the last one you mentioned.
[22:01:56] <taeaad> It's kind of obvious that you can do this, right, but I've never actually seen it. Kind of funny, feels like it's a gap in one's education.

[23:03:01] <riv> it's a good theory
[23:03:34] <taeaad> It's more about the approach than the topic—category theory in Haskell for example has generally just been something of an exasperation.

[23:13:50] <cherim> By algorithm you just mean single-source shortest paths with nonnegative weights? It's not some arcane mystery like Hu-Shing and the like
[23:13:55] <taeaad> riv: I mean that Haskell promotes category theory, but whenever I look at what the community is saying, it looks like abtract algebra plus monads. So I don't see exactly what they are promoting. And apparently, even the monads can be broken?
[23:14:19] <taeaad> I still have to look at Bartosz Milewski's book in more detail.
[23:14:51] <taeaad> cherim: So it's a weighted graph? Or can jou just give weights of 1? What about weights of 0?
[23:15:12] <taeaad> Hmm. I should perhaps look for Hu
[23:15:14] <taeaad> -Shing.
[23:16:11] <riv> taeaad, well i think haskell has a very restricted form of functor and monad in it
[23:16:18] <taeaad> cherim: Oh, looking at Wikipedia, I think perhaps I have seen it before.
[23:16:30] <cherim> I only mentioned Hu-Shing as an example of an algorithms which takes ~100 pages to state and prove (despite doing a relatively standard thing)
[23:16:50] <riv> it's always from the Hask category to the Hask category - and this is ignoring how it probably isn't strictly a category because of infinite loops and stuff
[23:16:55] <cherim> Dijkstra's shortest paths is common high school knowledge and can be explained in 3 lines
[23:17:00] <taeaad> riv: So that kind of statements seem to be what I get thrown with when trying to understand the Haskell Lang Category Theory (TM) and (R).
[23:17:30] <riv> but there is nothing bad about a programming language using ideas like these

[23:37:27] <taeaad> Feynman said that he started with Algebra for the Practical Man, which he found

[23:37:27] <taeaad> interesting.” Calculus for the Practical Man, however, created more lasting memories. His father was
[23:37:30] <taeaad> perplexed by the book, and as Feynman recalled, “this was rather a shock to me. . . . It was the first
