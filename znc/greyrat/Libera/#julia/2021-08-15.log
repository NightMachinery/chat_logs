[12:34:49] <andromodon_> Hey guys.  Who here uses Visual Studio Code with Julia?  I just set it up today, but the "Julia: Show Documentation" seems to only work for builtin functions, not packages.  For example if I put this in a file "ceil(3);using Plots;plot(result)", I can get documentation for "ceil" but not for "plot".  Going in the REPL and  running this line and then typing "?plot" works just fine.  But ultimately it means that the documentation in vscode is next to 
[12:34:49] <andromodon_> useless since most of what people interface with is packages.  How can I fix this?
