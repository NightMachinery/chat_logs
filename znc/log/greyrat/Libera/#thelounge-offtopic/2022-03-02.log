[01:16:49] <Snuupy> xnaas: have you played with mesh networking (zerotier/nebula/tailscale/tinc/netmaker) at all?
[01:17:14] <xnaas> nope; and not currently interested
[01:17:46] <Snuupy> I started looking into it because my client devices move from network to network and I can't guarantee I'll be in control of the router at all times
[01:17:52] <Snuupy> if I'm not in control of the router I can't ddns
[01:17:59] <Snuupy> if I can't ddns I can't expose services publicly
[01:19:25] <xnaas> I have a static public IP. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[01:19:32] <Snuupy> some services just aren't meant to be exposed publicly either
[01:19:39] <Snuupy> and rely on NAT/LAN to secure it
[01:19:46] * Snuupy eyes nvidia gamestreaming
[01:19:49] <xnaas> Against my will, even. If I wanted a new IPv4 address, I have to get the federal government to force AT&T's hand lol
[01:19:52] <Snuupy> or rdp
[01:19:57] <Snuupy> lol
[01:21:54] <xnaas> I RDP over an SSH tunnel.
[01:21:58] <xnaas> That's how I'm talking right now.
[01:22:19] <xnaas> I don't want to load my personal websites on government networks (but a random SSH connection is ok ;P )

[02:01:32] <Snuupy> yeah so you have to expose port 22 to internet
[02:01:58] <xnaas> well, not 22, but a port, yes
[02:02:02] <xnaas> :P
[02:02:09] <xnaas> way too much logspam to use 22 lol
[02:02:15] <xnaas> or I probably would for simplicity tbh
[02:06:23] <Snuupy> every time you swap routers or bring that box into a new environment
[02:06:26] <Snuupy> have to forward 22 again
[02:06:36] <Snuupy> assuming you even have control of that environment
[02:07:53] <xnaas> fortunately that's many years away and the next time it happens will also be the last for as long as possible :P
[02:08:00] <xnaas> but I get it
[02:08:04] <xnaas> not everyone is so fortunate
[02:08:07] <xnaas> so good that options exist
[02:08:12] <xnaas> just not interesting/relevant/whatever to me
[02:08:13] <xnaas> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[02:08:27] <Snuupy> understandable
[02:09:47] <xnaas> also: I'd only heard of zerotier and tailscale, so seeing 3 more names is like "oh no now there's two of them" but it's "five" instead :P
[02:10:09] <xnaas> (options are good, to an extent, of course!)
[02:10:21] <bookworm> forwarding a port takes 30s and that is with grabbing a cup of coffee first 
[02:10:42] <xnaas> Well, I'd have to forward three ports. That's at least a legit 30s.
[02:10:43] <xnaas> ;P
[02:10:48] <xnaas> (SSH, Mumble, IRC)
[02:11:25] <bookworm> you need one, wg. The rest should bloody hell speak wg ;P
[02:11:40] <bookworm> or some other vpn of your choice 
[02:11:56] <xnaas> "Oh y'all want to voice/text chat like we have for years? Just install this VPN lol"
[02:11:57] <xnaas> ðŸ™„
[02:12:20] <xnaas> "just put everything behind a VPN" is the dumbest shit that's plagued the selfhosted community in years, imo
[02:12:37] <xnaas> (I don't mean this as an attack on you, just generally frustrated by the non-answer)
[02:12:43] <xnaas> (since I see it 9000 times a day)
[02:12:44] <bookworm> I tend to disagree, looking at the general security properties of things 
[02:13:42] <bookworm> certainly nothing that talks with my living room goes over the open internet, I want an auth layer in between 
[02:13:55] <bookworm> and that auth layer is wireguard in my case
[02:14:18] <bookworm> public things are then on the VPS, which talks to the backend services via wg
[02:14:44] <bookworm> meaning the data is actually in my living room, public access goes via proxy in the form of the VPS
[02:17:38] <Snuupy> can't forward a port on a network I don't own
[02:17:50] <Snuupy> netmaker is zerotier but FOSS
[02:17:59] <xnaas> ah, nice
[02:18:01] <xnaas> FOSS ftw
[02:18:04] <Snuupy> nebula is slack's version idk why they need to make their own

[02:21:12] <bookworm> tailscale gives you availability for the networks that block udp by proxying the traffic via their servers 
[02:21:40] <bookworm> not sure if you really get a security benefit doing that considering that they control the keys etc
[02:21:57] <Snuupy> I'd be surprised if the other ones don't have relay servers
[02:22:11] <bookworm> for everything that's not blowing udp, wg alone works just fine
[02:22:12] <Snuupy> I know netmaker has relays, so zerotier must have it
[02:24:16] <Snuupy> ah zerotier is only free for non-commercial
[02:24:19] <Snuupy> nope
[02:24:27] <Snuupy> tailscale is only free with a device cap
[02:24:29] <Snuupy> also nope
[02:24:40] <bookworm> run your own?
[02:25:05] <Snuupy> for what, tailscale?
[02:25:20] <Snuupy> I'm happy to host my own, it's whether the licensing allows for it etc
[02:25:37] <bookworm> tailscale has open sourced their stuff on open platforms only, meaning the server side and maybe Android if you're lucky (didn't check)
[02:25:52] <bookworm> but do you really need tailscale level features?
[02:26:09] <bookworm> for small scales, openvpn or wireguard are perfectly enough 
[02:26:26] <bookworm> openvpn is tcp too, so unless they do DPI you're good
[02:26:35] <Snuupy> openvpn perf ðŸ¤®
[02:26:46] <bookworm> and if they do DPI they'll also block tailscale if their worth their salt
[02:26:58] <bookworm> they're*
[02:27:53] <bookworm> I've never had issues with openvpn to be honest, performance was ok
[02:28:36] <bookworm> I prefer wg nowdays because it's simpler and in the kernel
