[00:47:48] <maerwald> autoconf is a beauty of constantly changing macros
[00:48:20] <geekosaur> actually I'm wondering if it's being used by setup configure instead of autoconf
[00:48:41] <geekosaur> or cabal run-as-setup configure
[00:48:51] <maerwald> The only people who learn autoconf usually satisfy all of these constraints: 1. you love pain, 2. you love pain, 3. you're a student and have too much time, 4. you love obscure bash, 5. you enjoy complexity
[00:49:06] <unit73e> I was here thinking, is haskell jersey or mit style? as in "worse is better" or "the right thing". It's kind of both imo.
[00:49:34] <unit73e> certainly simple enough but tries to be correct
[00:49:42] <hololeap> maerwald: sounds fun
[00:49:59] <hololeap> I knew I avoided it for a reason
[00:50:12] <sm> I'd say more the right thing style at the core, for sure

[00:50:38] <maerwald> hololeap: you've watched one of those "slap contest" things on youtube? autoconf is like that
[00:50:48] <sm> devolving to worse is better at the edges ?
[00:51:37] <unit73e> if you compare to scala it's a lot more unnecessarily complex, for example
[00:51:39] <sm> ps can you link that paper/article for us
[00:52:19] <unit73e> even in scala channel they agree lol
[00:56:16] <maerwald> compare anything to scala and you come to the conclusion: ok, that was unnecessarily complex

[02:54:53] <monochrom> Well if the type is special then the monad instance is special too.
[02:54:57] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: so if you can't figure out for input 1247, maybe try figuring out what happens for 1.
[02:55:08] <c_wraith> RobotMicrowave: it's best to erase the phrase "IO monad" from your lexicon.  It makes you think the wrong thing is special.
[02:55:17] <c_wraith> RobotMicrowave: IO is special.  Monad is just normal haskell.

[05:31:31] <arahael> it still has the _original_ line failing in the error message, so it's still not actually using my particular basement.
[05:32:58] <arahael> Yep, just unpacked the locally packaged file, it absolutely does have that space in it, yet that space is missing.

But now I've switched to an arm64 version of ghc and all that - and sometime in the past 5 months I must've updated my local LLVM (part of xcode) so that it's version 13 - which is too new for the current haskell and makes me need to use 9.2.1

[14:02:12] <dminuoso> Think nixpkgs is the most active repository on all of github right now?
[14:03:54] <Franciman> dminuoso: NixOS officially packages software that is non free

[14:04:42] <dminuoso> This seems to be a religious topic for some I guess.
[14:05:00] <dminuoso> Absolutely nothing in all of nixos nudges you towards using it. In fact, you cant even install non-free software without explicitly enabling it.
[14:05:26] <Franciman> you are right
[14:05:36] <Franciman> I would have been best sayin: it does not discourage it
[14:05:39] <Franciman> that's a fact

[14:06:45] <dminuoso> not allowing to talk about proprietary software is getting quite religious now. :)
[14:07:32] <dminuoso> I think you're conflating "discouraging" with "making it as hard as possible"
[14:07:34] <Franciman> I don't care
[14:07:46] <Franciman> why?
[14:07:50] <dminuoso> NixOS discourages proprietary software by fact of not allowing you to install any unless you explicitly set an option.
[14:08:23] <Franciman> I see
[14:08:44] <Franciman> so, Guix works harder to make you use free software
[14:08:48] <Franciman> also
[14:08:52] <dminuoso> That sounds reasonable
[14:08:53] <Franciman> non free software is not propertary
[14:09:02] <dminuoso> Or rather not reasonable, but sounds more correct
[14:09:32] <dminuoso> Not sure what the distinction there is 
[14:09:59] <dminuoso> I always believed proprietary and non-free to be synonyms *shrugs*
[14:10:00] <Franciman> it's better discovered on your own

[14:10:45] <dminuoso> If VSCode wants to attach special meaning to those words fine

[14:14:53] <Hecate> free software or open governance?
[14:14:57] <Hecate> two very different things

[14:16:55] <merijn> How is Firefox non-free according to that definition?
[14:16:59] <Franciman> the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
[14:17:09] <Franciman> roughly this is the meaning
[14:17:15] <Franciman> and firefox doesn't allow you to distribute firefox
[14:17:20] <merijn> Franciman: It does
[14:17:24] <Franciman> one second
[14:17:27] <Franciman> holy hell

[14:17:30] <merijn> It doesn't allow you to use the *name* firefox
[14:17:35] <Franciman> indeed
[14:17:42] <Franciman> that's a violation
[14:17:48] <dminuoso> No its not.

[14:17:52] <Franciman> holy hell
[14:17:55] <Franciman> one second
[14:18:00] <dminuoso> Its about distributing the *software*, not the trademark.
[14:18:06] <merijn> The *software* can be distributed just fine
[14:18:25] <merijn> You cannot randomly take a trademark of someone else and use that.
[14:18:37] <merijn> That is, however, not a restriction on the software
[14:18:41] <dminuoso> While I agree that the mozilla foundation has a lot of highly questionable practices, and they're not the moral pillar of the software community by far, firefox is by all accounts free software.
[14:18:44] <Franciman> Mozilla has found a clever way to take away freedom 2 ("The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor") using trademark law instead of using copyright law.
[14:18:55] <merijn> Franciman: Untruee
[14:18:55] <Franciman> so you can't redistribute copies
[14:19:05] <merijn> Franciman: You *can* distribute copies, just not using the name firefox
[14:19:11] <Franciman> that's not firefox then
[14:19:21] <dminuoso> You're being silly now.
[14:19:27] <Franciman> honstly

[14:20:00] <dminuoso> Where does the FSF argue that firefox is not free software based on this?

[14:30:21] <dminuoso> It was not FSF
[14:30:25] <Franciman> yeah sure
[14:30:25] <merijn> I somehwat agree with Brett that re-distributing unmodified Firefox using the name could be fine, but I disagree with him that's sufficient to violate the free rights
[14:30:28] <Franciman> *shrugs*

[14:31:19] <Franciman> but you can be arsed to say it's not fsf
[14:31:22] <dminuoso> And even if they are funded, their opinion might not necessarily match the FSFs opinion
[14:31:27] <dminuoso> It's not FSF.

[14:32:29] <dminuoso> Not interested in continuing here
[14:32:45] <merijn> Franciman: Yes, because saying that takes 5 seconds. Anyway, this discussion seems mostly pointless. Brett says "unmodified firefox should be allowed to be distributed under the Firefox name, but requiring a name change on modification is fine"

[14:33:24] <Franciman> one second
[14:33:33] <Franciman> I was saying something different
[14:33:42] <Franciman> I was saying it is not the FSF they are just funded by them
[14:33:45] <merijn> So restricting name usage on modified versions is fine with the FSF
[14:33:46] <Franciman> i.e. dminuoso is right
[14:34:07] <jackdk> please stop beeping me about this
[14:34:22] <merijn> My view: Restricting name usage on unmodified versions is a reasonable compromise, because it's hard to track down and check whether copies are modified or not

[19:07:11] <lortabac> merijn: the increase in mutator time seems to be proportional to the total time, so it's probably not the creation alone
[19:07:49] <tomsmeding> is the size of the compact region also proportional to that?
[19:07:54] <lortabac> tomsmeding: no
[19:07:58] <lortabac> the size is fixed
[19:08:00] <tomsmeding> if so, creation might be linear in the size of the compact region

[21:26:25] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i guess i could write that if i figure out how to know what the type of a is
[21:26:40] <monochrom> No, you can't do it in Haskell.
[21:26:49] <monochrom> But you can do it in Java. Use instanceOf.
[21:27:18] <[itchyjunk]> Ah.. i am supposed to use instanceOf for my next hw set.. funny it came up here

[21:27:47] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmm
[21:27:53] <EvanR> that would violate parametricity
[21:28:01] <monochrom> If I relax the type sig to "f :: Typeable a => a -> a" then you can.  But I didn't.

[21:29:57] <EvanR> if someone gives you a parametric type, you immediately know stuff about what it can and can't do
[21:30:07] <dsal> `a` by itself means "any type at all is relevant here" and all possible types is greater than "all types that can show themselves"
[21:30:10] <[itchyjunk]> Is this the monad stuff? try to add 1 and if it fails do nothing
[21:30:17] <[itchyjunk]> if it works, great, move on?
[21:30:24] <dsal> constraints reduce the types you can pass, but give you a bit of wiggle room for doing things with the values.

[21:34:44] <EvanR> but can write a f :: a -> a, it just can't do that
[21:35:10] <monochrom> But you can in Java generics.  <T> T f(T a) { if (a instanceOf Integer) { ...
[21:35:26] <monochrom> This shows that Java generics is still not parametric polymorphism.
[21:35:57] <monochrom> Or vice versa, Haskell parametric polymorphism is not Java generics.
[21:36:21] <[itchyjunk]> interesting!
[21:36:37] <[itchyjunk]> I know almost nothing about java generics though, but makes sense i think
[21:37:04] <monochrom> You don't hear that very often because in practice, people don't actually abuse Java generics that way, they use it as parametric polymorphism, so no one notices the difference.

[21:40:19] <hpc> it's not the same f
[21:40:42] <monochrom> In Java, the point is exactly overloading is orthogonal to polymorphism.
[21:40:43] <hpc> it's two different functions with the same name
[21:40:47] <EvanR> go to a different language, get different conflicting terminology xD
[21:41:14] <[itchyjunk]> so overloading in haskell uses the same f somehow? huh interesting

[21:41:35] <monochrom> It's OK to take Java seriously.
[21:41:49] <monochrom> What's wrong is assuming that everyone solves problems the same way.
[21:42:16] <monochrom> or assuming that there is only one way.
[21:42:18] <hpc> iirc, if you wrote f(Object a) and f(SomethingElse a), g(Object a) {f(a)} is going to use the Object f, even if you do g(somethingElseValue)

[21:47:48] <sshine> [itchyjunk], ML modules also encourage ad-hoc polymorphism, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37694313/make-ocaml-function-polymorphic-for-int-lists-and-float-lists/37710287#37710287
[21:49:41] <monochrom> At that point, you are translating ad hoc polymorphism to parametric polymorphism and then you wonder why there is a line.
[21:50:03] <monochrom> sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] involves a bit of ad hoc polymorphism, yes.
[21:50:34] <monochrom> But in a language without Haskell type class, you could have gone sortBy :: (a -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a].
[21:50:49] <monochrom> which is a low-tech version of the module approach.
[21:51:17] <monochrom> But then, technically, "(a -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]" is parametric polymorphism.
[21:51:30] <EvanR> seeing C++ overloading as type directed name resolution and not polymorphism is cool xD
[21:51:42] <EvanR> now I wonder what polymorphism even is
[21:52:15] <EvanR> using the same function for different types
[21:52:18] <sshine> yea, so you could have parametric polymorphism at the bottom. but you could also parameterise your higher-order modules, making it parametrically polymorphic at the module level, and at the value level it'd be ad-hoc.

[23:35:20] <dsal> It's fun to do these without explicit recursion as well.

[23:54:36] <[itchyjunk]> Yes, comming up with them off the top of my head
[23:55:00] <[itchyjunk]> for some reason, googling for haskell exercise leads to much harder problem sets than expected :<
[23:55:19] *** Joins: remedan (~remedan@balak.me)
[23:55:38] <dsal> I rather like AoC.  It starts out pretty easy.
[23:55:48] <dsal> Then gets stupid hard sometimes, but by that point you're committed.
[23:56:11] <[itchyjunk]> Ah, advent of code? yeah i should skim through some of those problem sets
