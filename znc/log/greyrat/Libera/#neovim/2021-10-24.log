[00:04:31] <mjlbach[m]> Right now, it would be counted as inline (line 1) but our handling is wrong
[00:04:38] <mjlbach[m]> according to the spec*
[00:05:09] <mjlbach[m]> we should be counting \r as the terminating newline, and sending everything after as being on line 2 and shifting things downward

[00:08:44] <sumneko[m]> Thanks for your explanation.
[00:08:44] <sumneko[m]> I heard you say that some languages can still navigate correctly in other rows in this case, so I thought the row count calculation is still correct. In this case, it would be simple to fix the incremental synchronization.
[00:09:09] <dmitmel[m]> mjlbach[m]: handling this will suck 😑
[00:09:14] <mjlbach[m]> yeah it's a huge pain
[00:09:42] <mjlbach[m]> we have to change all of our code navigation handlers too

[00:09:47] <mjlbach[m]> Yes, I'm not clear why navigation works at all
[00:09:48] <dmitmel[m]> `Position#line` can't be trusted without either a mapping or re-counting all lines from the beginning
[00:09:55] <mjlbach[m]> yup
[00:10:02] <mjlbach[m]> In the thing I'm working on we cache the mapping

[00:29:03] <maverun[m]> well i did used both and that was causing conflict having 2 client running, so i just use lspinstall plugins instead
[00:29:03] <phaazon[m]> <mjlbach[m]> "It's weird this all started over..." <- it’s almost funny to me, because Hop + Treesitter still makes no sense to me
[00:29:19] <phaazon[m]> about your question about extending hop without modifying the core, not yet, but there’s some traction towards that
[00:29:34] <phaazon[m]> some people opened PRs but I’m not satisfied with them
[00:29:40] <mjlbach[m]> phaazon[m]: I don't get it either, but if it's pluggable then it's not your problem

[00:33:15] <dundargoc[m]> dmitmel[m]: Perfect. Thing is, I did that as well but I get an error since sumneko is trying to create files (?) which it can't do since it doesn't have permission. How do you work around that?
[00:33:23] <Bowuigi[m]> phaazon[m]: It does sometimes, on unfinished projects
[00:33:23] <phaazon[m]> Bowuigi[m]: yes, exactly
[00:33:44] <phaazon[m]> and adding new features / maintaining code is not like frenzy rush of commits
[00:33:45] <dmitmel[m]> dundargoc[m]: provide the --metapath and --logpath parameters or how were they called
[00:33:54] <phaazon[m]> sometimes adding a new features takes time
[00:33:54] <dundargoc[m]> dmitmel[m]: Come again?
[00:33:59] <phaazon[m]> sometimes there is no feature to add at all
[00:34:24] <dundargoc[m]> dmitmel[m]: Are those flags to lua-server-language?
[00:34:32] <phaazon[m]> but I think it’s a pretty toxic thing to say to an author that « your thing is unmaintain because you don’t commit often anymore »
[00:34:42] <phaazon[m]> the funny thing is that, that guy, his fork, the last commit is 1month old
[00:34:44] <Bowuigi[m]> Speaking about the author of the Lua LSP server and pinging, on Matrix by default a name mention is usually a ping

[00:42:06] <phaazon[m]> architecturing code is not only pushing lines of codes, it’s interersting the problem that is solved, the overall design, the main idea, etc.
[00:42:13] <phaazon[m]> most contributors I see lack that
[00:42:18] <phaazon[m]> they don’t take the time to understand the whole picture
[00:42:26] <phaazon[m]> and then for 1 hour of work they did to write the PR
[00:42:37] <phaazon[m]> it’s 2 / 3 hours of me reading and understand what they are trying to do
[00:42:44] <phaazon[m]> and most of the time, I ask them to change to a better design anyway
[00:42:59] <phaazon[m]> and that is why reviewing code in open-source as an author of a project is really, really exhausting

[00:49:34] <phaazon[m]> then the few weeks afterwards, I fixed tons of things related to corner cases, merged a bunch of PRs, and then started to receive super niche and hard to review PRs, which I wasn’t able to review in weeks because of life™ and other projects

[04:35:58] <muniter[m]> To support vblock in this way I think changing the pattern to `/%V./` might do the trick.

[11:05:55] <bobdobbs> If anyone is able to help me this, I've put a question up on stackoverflow:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69694293/in-nvim-how-do-i-switch-between-buffers
[11:07:36] <dmitmel[m]> <bobdobbs> "':buffers' or ':ls' shows a list..." <- see the number in the leftmost column? that's buffer numbers (or bufnrs). let's say it is 123, to switch do `:123buffer` or `:123b` for short
[11:08:12] <dmitmel[m]> <low-key> "is it okay to now just move that..." <- no, the binary is not standalone. it is merely a launcher for the Lua scripts.
[11:08:27] <low-key> ah! thanks a lot for clearing that up

[11:10:37] <bobdobbs> dmitmel[m]: if I do that, I get "no write since last change (add ! to override)"... which I guess is some information about that buffer. But I'm not taken to the buffer

[11:11:11] <dmitmel[m]> I think `:set hidden` in the vimrc should take care of this
[11:11:41] <the-alexander[m]> bobdobbs: You have to save the buffer before switching
[11:12:03] <the-alexander[m]> Or set 'hidden'
[11:12:25] <bobdobbs> what does ':set hidden' do?
[11:13:02] <dmitmel[m]> it makes it so that when buffers go off-screen, they are merely hidden instead of being closed
[11:13:04] <the-alexander[m]> It allow s to switch an unwritten buffer

[12:41:36] <zostj> bew[m]: just tabstop, shiftwidth, softtabstop, etc for lua so they indent with 2 spaces instead of the GENERAL indent i have in my config - which are set to 4
[12:41:55] <dmitmel[m]> <zostj> "if i want to set indentation for..." <- ftplugin
[12:42:30] <dmitmel[m]> indent/ is for functions which implement autoindentation rules
[12:42:43] <dmitmel[m]> after/ftplugin/ is for overriding settings from installed plugins
[12:43:55] <dmitmel[m]> about using an autocommand: yes, you can do it like that, but putting that stuff in ftplugins is cleaner IMO
[12:44:11] <dmitmel[m]> so it is just a matter of preference
[12:44:28] <bew[m]> dmitmel[m]: Personally I put all these in after/ftplugin 👀 so I'm sure it's the things I want.. (is that wrong?) 
[12:45:15] <dmitmel[m]> I do it like that too

[12:46:42] <zostj> https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code#Different_settings_for_different_file_types
[12:46:53] <zostj> this also said to use after/ftplugin
[12:48:07] <zostj> but like dmitmel[m] said, i think it's just weather you want to have it be the FINAL say in the matter IF other plugins also set the same options
[12:51:55] <zostj> dmitmel[m]: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/26169/difference-between-adding-vim-after-ftplugin-vs-vim-ftplugin
[12:52:02] <zostj> this explains it in great detail
[12:55:54] <dmitmel[m]> right
[12:56:06] <zostj> so i looked in my $VIMRUNTIME and vim already comes with its own lua.vim <--- shouldn't the indent have already been set in here? but when i looked in this file, it doesn't seem to be setting any indenttation rules at all. while python.vim in that directory did set it. 
[12:56:31] <zostj> dmitmel[m]: i meant to send that to bew[m] :P
[12:58:27] <clason[m]> there's `runtime/indent/lua.vim` (at least in Nvim)

[17:59:22] <clason[m]> but `:colorscheme <foo>` basically does two things:
[17:59:22] <clason[m]> 1. sources `colors/<foo>.(vim|lua)` from `runtimepath` and `packpath` (`vim` is tried first)
[17:59:22] <clason[m]> 2. triggers the `ColorScheme(Pre|Post)` autocommands

[23:32:27] <neovim[m]> I think it'd be like `globals = { "vim", "it" }` etc.
[23:32:38] <neovim[m]> "describe" being another one

[23:47:23] <clason[m]> Respect the branding :)  It's Neovim (the project), or Nvim (the editor), or nvim (the binary)
[23:48:55] <SeanDewar[m]> <neovim[m]> "gotta love the `(Neo)Vim..." <- :P cuz `vim` module applies to vim's if_lua too
[23:49:02] <SeanDewar[m]> i love all the vims!
[23:49:05] <clason[m]> (You can buy the corporate design manual for the low, low price of $14.99 (plus S&H))
[23:49:29] <neovim[m]> SeanDewar[m]: no but the point is your config wouldn't even work in Vim lol
[23:49:42] <SeanDewar[m]> oh yeah...
[23:49:56] <SeanDewar[m]> that actually did not even cross my mind
[23:50:27] <neovim[m]> *loads up Vim* "hey why isn't my init.lua working??? >:("
[23:50:34] <SeanDewar[m]> well maybe i'll work on a vim if_lua thing some day... using neovim :P
[23:50:52] <neovim[m]> yeah that's the only way it'd be justifiable lol
[23:50:58] <clason[m]> next you'll work on your init.lua in Helix :P
[23:52:06] <dundargoc[m]> I kinda wished Helix would use neovim as their main source of inspiration instead of kakoune.

[23:52:27] <p00f[m]> damn
[23:52:33] <p00f[m]> inb4 mind completion
[23:52:44] <p00f[m]> completes what you are thinking
[23:52:44] <neovim[m]> completion sources just keep gitting better
[23:52:50] <dundargoc[m]> badum tish
[23:53:36] <SeanDewar[m]> p00f[m]: > why do all my completions have emoji?!
[23:53:50] <p00f[m]> lmaoo
