[03:59:43] <cb> i use AGPL to spook children
[03:59:53] <hoistbypetard> :)
[03:59:55] <cb> GPLv3 to spook a large israeli company
[03:59:57] <cb> that kinda thing
[04:00:36] <hoistbypetard> i was starting to type... my default for most things i throw online is "if anything here is useful to anyone other than me, you can have it under " (MIT terms)
[04:00:56] <hoistbypetard> but i've been tempted to default to AGPL just for giggles
[04:02:37] <hoistbypetard> i do wonder what i'm missing with all the people who clutch their pearls about what amazon's doing... it seems to me AGPL would sort that right out.
[04:06:15] <cb> agpl as i found out is an utter clusterfuck of a license
[04:06:22] <cb> so im not even willing to use it to scare children
[04:09:14] <hoistbypetard> is it? lame. the idea of requiring you to disclose source if you offer a derivative work as a service seems not awful
[04:09:56] <hoistbypetard> maybe the BSL is the thing to do for scaring children
[04:14:12] <goodger> can't be as bad as cognitect's licensing
[04:14:48] <goodger> I've seen ‘all rights reserved, licensed under eclipse public license’ more times than I'd care to count
[04:20:51] <alyx> honestly i don't know that AGPL really matters for Amazon
[04:21:23] <alyx> based on how most companies are relicensing, it seems less that Amazon is modifying the base software and more that the tooling they have _around_ that software is their success
[04:22:13] <alyx> at least, that's my take based on the SSPL, which is Mongo and Elastic now mainly

[19:57:55] <cb> for me im not embedded in the apple ecosystem
[19:57:58] <cb> i could switch when i want to
[19:58:11] <dasm> i used osx for 4 years next to android. i never invested into "pure apple experience" and it was easier to me, to buy dell and install linux
[19:58:19] <hoistbypetard> same, though i do have apple watch with my phone
[19:58:50] <hoistbypetard> other than that switching would not be painful for me. (i use a linux desktop anyway, so android appeals in that respect)

[20:33:01] <hoistbypetard> the amount of yak shaving i did last night to be able to work on a side project from a tablet for 6 or 7 days really astonished me.
[20:33:20] <hoistbypetard> i started off using gitpod's free plan. (don't care if i need to make these repos public or not)
[20:33:53] <hoistbypetard> it was ok on an underpowered laptop, but sucked on the tablet.
[20:35:02] <hoistbypetard> so i spun up a ubuntu vm with https://github.com/cdr/code-server on it, figuring i could vpn in and use that

[20:36:40] <hoistbypetard> on iPad, the hoops you have to jump through to get a PWA that's behind a self-signed cert working are astonishing, so i decided to get it a LetsEncrypt cert

[23:33:11] <hoistbypetard> Xe: I used to do that, pre LetsEncrypt. But automating LetsEncrypt for my servers turned out to be easier than automating trust store updates for the sundry clients I spin up to try different things out :)
[23:34:48] <hoistbypetard> Windows is kind of a PITA that way unless you want to run a domain, and iThings are similarly a pain unless you want to run a MDM. Neither of which I was quite prepared to do... it's an odd shape when there's more than you like to do manually but not enough to be worth real management infrastructure
