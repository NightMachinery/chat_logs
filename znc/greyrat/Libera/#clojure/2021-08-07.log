[00:10:10] <technomancy> in that file `args` is a list of strings passed in from the CLI

[01:29:08] <sobel> cider attempt: ubuntu packages didn't turn on elpa, so i tried to install cider/clojure-doc from apt, but my emacs still doesn't seem to have the packages.
[01:29:42] <andreyorst> CIDER is on MELPA
[01:30:19] <sobel> the package i installed is elpa-cider
[01:31:53] <andreyorst> why not to use Emacs' built in package manager tho?
[01:32:12] <technomancy> there's good reasons to avoid melpa

[01:32:24] <technomancy> it has a history of bad many security decisions
[01:32:53] <andreyorst> then borg?
[01:33:29] <sobel> aha, i ubuntu installed 3 launchers for emacs and i picked the wrong one
[01:33:31] <technomancy> or you can manually install the single file in monroe in much less time than this entire conversation took =)
[01:33:42] <sobel> this other launcher yields access to the packages i installed
[01:33:49] <sobel> 'emacs' vs 'emacs-gui'
[01:34:41] <sobel> apparently the other launcher also didn't have access to package-install either; i tried that

[02:23:34] <EdwardIII> lot of celebs on #clojure :)
[02:23:55] <technomancy> haha well I don't know about that
[02:24:33] <EdwardIII> i think my brother might have this board
[02:24:54] <EdwardIII> i've got an ergodox ez, but it was watching the clojure talk by the dactyl guy that got me interested in clojure
[02:25:46] *** Quits: egli (~user@193-47-178-139-pool.fiber.fcom.ch) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:26:29] <technomancy> yeah the dactyl is impressive. I don't work at my desk much so it's not a good fit for me but I appreciate the thoughtful design.
[02:27:06] <EdwardIII> i have all the parts but i stalled, really need to finish making it. i suck at soldering 
[02:28:17] <technomancy> luckily with a keyboard whatever bad soldering mistakes you make can always be fixed later
[02:29:16] <EdwardIII> easy for you to say, keyboard making expert who doesn't constantly melt everything ;)
[02:29:43] <technomancy> I have made plenty of screw-ups
[02:30:11] <technomancy> unless you literally bake the microcontroller whatever damage you cause can always be routed around
[02:30:15] <sobel> sounds like prototyping
[02:30:17] <EdwardIII> the case my IRC friend printed for the dactyl is a bit of a nightmare
[02:30:24] <sobel> (destroying raw materials!)
[02:30:25] <EdwardIII> really really hard to work around the edges
[02:30:40] <technomancy> even if you fry a pin of the controller, there's other pins you can reroute it to, and fix it in firmware!
[02:30:42] <sobel> heh, dactyl nightmare... one of the earliest immersive 3d/VR games
[02:30:45] <EdwardIII> actually replacing the microcontroller is not too scary :) snip all the cables, plop a new one in
[02:31:52] <EdwardIII> i'm using sticky copper traces for the cols to try and make it a bit easier: https://imgur.com/a/h4u6E8G
[02:32:09] <EdwardIII> hoping they don't fall off on a hot summer day heh
[02:32:35] <technomancy> oh nice hack!
[02:32:46] <EdwardIII> not an original thought. saw it on youtube
[02:33:15] <EdwardIII> soldering on the diodes next. that part i'm slightly sweaty about because if i do it wrong, i do it wrong a lot of times 
[02:33:30] <EdwardIII> i *think* i know what i'm testing for when i test with the multimeter
[02:34:29] <technomancy> the nice thing is you only have to care about "is the connection made or not" nothing about the voltage levels in between
[02:34:42] <EdwardIII> yes, it is fairly simple

[02:56:43] <technomancy> lmao I went back to look at the tiny bit of cljs I wrote for one month back in 2017 and I found that I had to replace this code: (condp = (-> state (get-in state/expanded-repos-path) (contains? repo)) true "expanded" false "unexpanded")
