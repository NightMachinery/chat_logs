[02:33:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And so it's actually a problem that's a lot like what you see in some of the online ad tech literature, where you might have a lot of interventions that are worth doing -- our best guess right now is that if you show someone 100 ads in the week before the election, it'll increase their chance of voting for you by maybe like 1% to one and a half percent. And ads cost like $30 per thousand. That's very cost-effective, it's a
[02:33:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  good idea. But it makes measurement very challenging." ... heh
[02:33:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What I think is interesting is that we really, and it just shows, it's not just about, ‚ÄúOh, we need to follow the data.‚Äù In politics, with this measurement problem, I think that the Obama people -- and I was part of this -- really chose easy to measure interventions, that we knew had very small effects, over harder to test things."
[02:34:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What's an example?" "easy to test thing is canvassing because whether or not you vote is a matter of public record. So, you knock on 100,000 doors, you don't knock on 100,000 doors. You randomize. It's all very clean. And then you can show that you raise someone's chance of voting by like three or four tenths of a percent. And it's statistically significant because you looked at so many people.  But if you multiply it out, if
[02:34:36] <Obormot\Arcturus>  you knock every single door maybe you raise vote share by six or seven hundredths of a percent. It's not really a very big deal.  But if you look at stuff like television ads, it's very hard to test. Just because it's very hard to do individual level experiments, you have to collect surveys, it becomes very expensive."
[02:35:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Like in 2014, finally someone did a precinct level randomized experiment with yard signs. And it turns out that yard signs are probably an order of magnitude or two more cost-effective -- honestly, between two to three is my 25 to 75 interval -- more effective than the canvassing. If I was running in a race, a congressional race, and I had a choice between 100 dedicated volunteers knocking on doors, and a yard sign in every

[03:16:02] <adiabatic> hah
[03:20:32] <kuudes> hmm. I have started to ponder if it would be feasible to make a simple model about covid variant reproduction and vaccines as bayesian summation
[03:21:49] <kuudes> basicly there likely should be an amount of virus in the body as virus particles when a human dies; should this be lognormal? ie normal on logspace
[03:22:30] <kuudes> then there is similar distribution of particles inside a human when infection happens
[03:22:56] <kuudes> the virus has a replication factor over time, which in this sort of model would just be a constant speed in logspace
[03:23:21] <kuudes> and body has its immune function, which would be similarly factor over time, ie a negative speed over logspace over time
[03:24:14] <Gurkenglas> the problem is that outliers drive the game. omicron plausibly came from an immunocompromised long-term incubator
[03:24:37] <kuudes> the immune system starts after infection, so there likely should be both a gate of amount of virus in the body and a gate of time after infection, whichever comes first
[03:24:46] <Gurkenglas> who knows whether the next virus upgrade costs 100x or 10x the mutation opportunities?
[03:25:27] <kuudes> so better replicating virus would be at advantage, and if your immune system had lower top speed than virus, you would certainly die eventually
[03:25:53] <kuudes> if your immune system was faster, you would survive if it was fast enough that it could not take you over the death limit
[03:26:08] <kuudes> vaccines would basicly make the immune system faster
[03:27:09] <kuudes> unsymptomatic, symptomatic, hospitalized, icu, death all would be gaussian gates on this log particle count space
[03:28:20] <kuudes> I guess vaccine could both make the immune system faster in speed and in reaction

[03:41:26] <gwern> yeah, the foundations are pretty lunatic
[03:41:37] <saturn2> no but i think i've read or heard david shor explaining this somewhere else
[03:41:50] <gwern> foundations with permanent endowments are designed to be immune to any kind of market discipline or oversight, and boy howdy are they immune
[03:42:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a lot of stuff in here ... man
[03:42:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't quote all of it but it's like every other paragraph there's a "wow things make sense now" thing
[03:43:11] <gwern> there's a reason 'shorpilled' is a term

[03:43:35] <kuudes> indeed the immune reaction is bad, but no immune reaction is bad as well
[03:43:54] <kuudes> ie the lung cells which produce the virus, explode to release the virus particles
[03:48:19] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: https://whatismusic.info/blog/MusicIsNotAPositiveSuperstimulusItsANegativeSuperstimulus.html what an annoying overuse of boxes for design
[03:48:19] <Robomot> What is Music? Music Is Not A Positive Superstimulus ‚Äì It's A Negative Superstimulus
[03:49:29] <saturn2> kuudes: yeah
[03:50:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Hmmm. So I see what you mean, obviously, but I actually don't think I'd characterize this as *overuse* of boxes, per se. The problem here, imo, is that the *inconsistency* of use calls attention to the boxes, and *that* makes them seem overused ... if it were more consistent and disciplined, he could have at least as many boxes and it would look much more sane and subdued
[03:51:11] <spxtr> "in 2012, which was not that long ago, the correlation between Democratic vote share in the Senate and Democratic vote share in the presidency, state by state was about 0.71 or something. And so there was an enormous amount of tickets flooding. It was really possible for a very charismatic person to go on and pick good ads and run on the right platform and then distinguish themselves from the party. 
[03:51:17] <spxtr> Flash forward to 2020, that correlation was 0.954."
[03:51:22] <spxtr> Pheeew
[03:52:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: For instance: the heading boxes have no right borders. The page title box is 2x width, for some reason. They're of different colors, lightness values. Some of the stuff isn't in any box, like the byline. There's some block contrast done by other means (like the bulleted lists). All of this just draws attention to the boxes!
[03:52:20] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I dunno, even if you made the nesting more consistent - put the title/abstract in a box instead of two separate ones, put the subsections into boxes instead of just making them smaller - I think it would still be way too many lines taking up pixels for hierarchical structure already more easily expressed by the headers
[03:52:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> I bet I could do it in a coherent and pleasing way
[03:53:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> THis isn't, to be clear, the best or most inspired design approach, but in this case I think there are implementation errors not directly mappable to "overuse" per se
[03:53:08] <gwern> hm. I'm curious to see if you could, on the other hand, is it a good use of anyone's time to try to fix his design?
[03:53:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> (no)
[03:53:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Def. not a good use of time, I got too much other shit to do anyhow
[03:53:31] <spxtr> Just get rid of that outer box border and the rest is ugly but not horribly so
[03:53:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> So this assertion will have to go untested for now (or ever probably)
[03:54:18] <spxtr> Actually I would get rid of both the red outer border and the light grey article border.

[03:58:32] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: one thing i disagree about is that political campaigns have a strong incentive to win. it's better in terms of donations when they lose, and they get to blame everything bad that happens on the evil opposite party without taking any risk themselves
[03:59:44] <gwern> just because it works for trump doesn't mean it's a general phenomenon. generally, it is better to win than to lose
[04:01:36] <saturn2> how do you know that?

[07:57:41] <Robomot> Hello from Emacs Docs | Emacs Docs (Description will go into a meta tag in)
[07:58:14] <quanticle> Okay, real talk: at what point did our reaction to "modern" go from, "Oh?" to "Oh no"
[07:59:27] <adiabatic> I never learned how to use gnu info
[07:59:51] <adiabatic> so I could use this if I get transported to a bizarro universe where emacs is the normal editor and vim is this weird thing everyone has to install
[08:00:42] <quanticle> https://www.emacsdocs.org/docs/emacs/Indentation <-- This is to troll Obormot\Arcturus
[08:00:42] <Robomot> 24 Indentation | Emacs Docs (Indentation refers to inserting or adjusting whitespace characters (space and/or tab characters) at the beginning of a line of text. This chapter documents indentation commands and options which are common to Text mode and related modes, as well as programming language modes. See Program Indent, for additional documentation about indenting in programming modes.)
[08:01:14] <adiabatic> why does this troll him
[08:01:37] <quanticle> "The exact behavior of TAB depends on the major mode. In Text mode and related major modes, TAB normally inserts some combination of space and tab characters to advance point to the next tab stop (see Tab Stops). For this purpose, the position of the first non-whitespace character on the preceding line is treated as an additional tab stop, so you can use TAB to align point with the preceding
[08:01:39] <quanticle> line. If the region is active (see Using Region), TAB acts specially: it indents each line in the region so that its first non-whitespace character is aligned with the preceding line. In programming modes, TAB indents the current line of code in a way that makes sense given the code in the preceding lines. If the region is active, all the lines in the region are indented this way. If point was
[08:01:41] <quanticle> initially within the current line‚Äôs indentation, it is repositioned to the first non-whitespace character on the line. If you just want to insert a tab character in the buffer, type C-q TAB (see Inserting Text)."

[08:43:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is ... representedObject.location, key path "pathFromRoot.0.title", or, if that is nil (i.e., Elvis operator), then instead query representedObject.location for a description on the "host" key

[08:49:13] <adiabatic> SAT-I grinders out in the 95%-asian suburban public schools that are applying to Harvard and getting rejected"
[08:51:06] <quanticle> If I might ask, how high was your school district ranked, compared to other school districts in the state.
[08:51:31] <adiabatic> Private school, so hell if I know.
[08:51:37] <quanticle> Okay, well that's why
[08:52:21] <quanticle> Indian parents are all about the school district rank. They don't generally send their kids to private school (because they're not that rich), but they will 100% do everything they can to live in a school district that's top-3 in the state
[08:52:26] <adiabatic> Left out: the zero-personality grinders would've been filtered out by my school's admissions team anyway.
[08:52:49] <adiabatic> left out of my long blurb*
[08:53:15] <adiabatic> We had _some_ indians (and a couple half-indians).
[08:53:33] <quanticle> My school district was ranked #2 and #3 in the time I went there. I was on the leading edge of this current wave of immigration into Minnesota, so I didn't see *that* many, but there were a *lot* of zero-personality grinders when my brother went to school.

[08:55:02] <quanticle> Also, this is anecdotal evidence from my dad's friend in Fremont, CA, but he notes that white parents in his area have been pulling their kids and sending them to either private school or to school districts farther away because the local school district has gotten too competitive
[08:55:22] <quanticle> Like, there's basically zero chance of a white kid becoming valedictorian or graduating with honors.
[08:55:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is shockingly powerful, wtf)
[08:55:40] <adiabatic> they were talking about this, like, 15 years ago up in norcal. there's a point at which schools become too asian
[08:56:02] <adiabatic> then again, asia is too asian for a lot of asians
[08:56:09] <quanticle> lol
[08:56:12] <quanticle> Absolutely true
[08:56:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I remember now why I made this. I read an NSHipster article about how you can use KVC to implement a DSL and I thought "YES")
[08:56:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And then I thought "why don't I just put all the capabilities I can think of into this")
[08:57:12] <quanticle> KVC?
[08:57:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Key-Value Coding
[08:57:18] <quanticle> Ah, okay

[08:57:33] <Robomot> The index.html pages are the default pages for your directories. This tutorial explains how to use The index.html page is the most common name used for the default page shown on a website if no...
[08:57:48] <adiabatic> yes Robomot, that's totally true
[08:57:50] <quanticle> Ah yes, when you discover a shiny new hammer, everything looks like a nail
[08:58:03] <quanticle> Like me with functional programming
[08:58:07] <adiabatic> KVC is what, NeXT-era?
[08:58:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Uhhh I mean yes, sure, in the same sense that, like, NSString is NeXT-era
[08:58:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> A lot of ObjC and Cocoa dates back to then
[08:58:39] <adiabatic> thought so
[08:58:56] <adiabatic> I've _heard_ of KVC, but I never really got much past The Rules
[08:59:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Yeah KVC is like, what if you could pass subscript any kind of object with string keys? Like what if you could just pass strings to objects and get back anything
[08:59:39] <quanticle> Isn't that... message passing?
[08:59:54] <adiabatic> now I think I like Swift more. I like how it's Rust lite, but with nice argument schemes. Seems weird that the new thing in JS is to pass in an object with options.
[09:00:09] <adiabatic> (having written a total of 45 lines of Swift)
[09:00:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: No, message passing requires methods to respond to specific messages with specific signatures
[09:00:34] <quanticle> Okay, so how does KVC determine what data to respond with?
[09:00:55] <quanticle> You send a string to an object, and it has a stored response for that string?
[09:01:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the beauty of it
[09:01:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> You write an objectForKeyPath method
[09:01:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it can return any damn thing you want
[09:02:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are, like, standard responses, like the built-in collection classes comply with KVC in certain obvious ways like ... passing "foo.bar.baz" to someDictionary is like going someDictionary[@"foo"][@"bar"][@"baz"], etc. ... some other similar stuff... there's collection accessors...
[09:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can access object properties directly that way...
[09:03:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's just the defaults! It can be anything!
[09:03:03] <quanticle> Is this like how, in Ruby, you can define a method_missing function on an object, such that when you call a method that the object doesn't support, Ruby calls method_missing with the name of the "missing" function, and its arguments and you can decide what to do from there?
[09:03:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can write an objectForKeyPath that takes a string, parses it as a mathematical expression, calculates it, and returns a number!
[09:03:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can write one that you pass a URL to and it retrieves the data at that URL and returns it!
[09:03:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> It can be a.ny.thing.

[09:05:11] <Robomot> KVC Collection Operators - NSHipster (Rubyists laugh at Objective-C‚Äôs bloated syntax. Although we lost a few pounds over the summer with our sleek new object literals, those Red-headed bullies still taunt us with their map one-liners and their fancy Symbol#to_proc. Fortunately, Key-Value Coding has an ace up its sleeves.)
[09:05:14] <quanticle> Okay, maybe this is just my Ruby (and Groovy) scars showing w.r.t. ActiveRecord, but that seems like an utter pain in the ass to debug. You can pass anything to anything, so finding the code that actually handles that anything either requires you to know the conventions in use or a lot of work with the debugger.
[09:05:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This is Probably a Terrible Idea" >_>
[09:05:32] <quanticle> Haha
[09:05:39] <quanticle> I see you've anticipated my objection
[09:06:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Nah, I mean, it's syntactically delineated. The message passing / method / property syntax is not like the subscripted access syntax. There's no "bare strings" in Objective C.
[09:06:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> [myObj foo];  and  myObj[@"foo"]  ... are clearly different
[09:06:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The latter, of course, is equivalent to [myObj objectForKeyPath:@"foo"])
[09:08:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> So it's not like method_missing after all
[09:09:34] <quanticle> Oh, okay. So it's always clear that I'm calling objectForKeyPath with an argument
[09:10:02] <quanticle> What Ruby does (which is the problem, IMO) is that it makes method_missing calls look exactly the same as regular method calls
[09:10:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right. It's basically extending the "subscripted access operator" to all objects
[09:10:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, any object, at any rate, not actually "all"
[09:10:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (... you could, I guess, write a category on NSObject that defines an objectForKeyPath for it but uh... that probably really would be a Terrible Idea)

[14:06:59] <Gurkenglas> Overfishing being fine permits a neat test run for global cooperation. What'd happen if the world told China: You're killing the world's fish already, you may as well do it openly. We hereby grant you the power to set the per-capita fishing certificates that each country is issued. By default, we will assume you to be assigning as many certificates per-capita as required to make you come out even.
[14:17:50] <Gurkenglas> Perhaps we should make it explicitly parallel to nuclear MAD. The UN publishes statistics on each country's fishing, CO2 output and nukes used. Call a superpower any country the world can't afford a war with, to a first approximation because it has nukes. Issue as many fishing, Co2 and nuke use certificates per capita to each country as required to make all superpower come out at least even. Make it expected of 
[14:17:50] <Gurkenglas> non-superpower countries to use their certificates or sell them to the highest bidder, without blaming them for it. Sanction non-superpower countries that use more certificates than they have. Bomb them if sanctions are intractable.
[14:19:39] <Gurkenglas> if it works we can add statistics like military action and dangerous research.
[14:19:47] <PapuaHardyNet> "use more certificates than they have" what lol
[14:20:34] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, bomb somalia if it fishes too much and you can't find someone to pay for it.
[14:20:51] <PapuaHardyNet> is it that easy to detect overfishing?
[14:20:59] <PapuaHardyNet> if it isn't then this is infeasible
[14:21:34] <Gurkenglas> release fish with trackers into the general area, see if they're caught.
[14:24:09] <Khoth> Wait what? China decides how many nuclear weapons countries can use per-capita, then countries that don't want to nuke anyone can sell the permits to countries that do, and if a country starts a bigger nuclear war than it has permission to, then the UN will publish a report on them?
[14:24:59] <Gurkenglas> Khoth, not only China - everyone who has nukes says a number, the highest is adopted.
[14:25:11] <PapuaHardyNet> nukecoin
[14:25:43] <Gurkenglas> Not saying 0 is, of course, a very bad PR move. As now.
[14:26:53] <Gurkenglas> Pay somalian fishermen to betray large vessels, such as in "asylum for you and your family".
[14:30:34] <Gurkenglas> Of course, in practice, as soon as I said a clever plan that involves bombing defectors I lost the game of (what was the proper name?) international security simulation by causing WWIII.
[14:30:59] <Gurkenglas> the abbreviation that comes to mind is NSDAP, but that means something else :)
[14:32:32] <PapuaHardyNet> still kind of infeasible
[14:32:44] <Gurkenglas> how so?
[14:33:21] <PapuaHardyNet> releasing fish with trackers into the general area, see if they're caught - that's a proxy, and somalia can argue over the results
[14:33:28] <PapuaHardyNet> they can claim they are being framed
[14:33:32] <PapuaHardyNet> lots of moving parts tbh
[14:33:38] <Gurkenglas> (ah, National Security Decision Making game)
[14:34:11] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, framed by whoever released the tracking-fish or by rogue fisherman from other countries?

[14:35:55] <PapuaHardyNet> I sound pessimistic, but I believe it is the right attitude to take towards solutions that are complicated and have a lot of technical moving parts but aren't as fleshed out when it comes to dealing with the messy reality of *people*

[14:51:12] <dv^_^> what's the point? can't the saboteur just cover the camera during the act?
[14:51:24] <Gurkenglas> Then it's clear it was him because he covered the camera? O_o
[14:52:10] <dv^_^> "it was an accident, boss"
[14:52:30] <Gurkenglas> "the machine is broken and you were the only one near it who covered his camera."

[15:28:00] <kuudes> moscow is south of berlin btw
[15:29:47] <Gurkenglas> I'm guessing that moscow will become slightly warmer than now, and so berlin might become today's moscow? but those calculations have already been done by other people :). but it doesn't happen if and only if the policies are updated to mine.
[15:32:23] <Gurkenglas> People acclimatize to cold over the course of two weeks, as you've surely noticed. Does part of that effect require starting from a young age?
[15:33:44] <Gurkenglas> I suppose some people have different personal instincts than mine here and would want to migrate, and maybe some people today grow up in cold countries and migrate out of them because of this. Do you expect it to be significant portions?

[21:24:04] <ggreer> kuudes: the real question is: are the politicians getting 3rd doses?
[21:24:21] <ggreer> if you look at where they're hypocrites and where they're not, you can get a decent idea of what works
[21:24:28] <ggreer> or at least what they think works
[21:24:38] <kuudes> well the politicians want third doses for everyone
[21:24:42] <kuudes> all of them, about
[21:24:56] <kuudes> all but antivaxxer insane people, who are less than 10% I think
[21:25:08] <kuudes> they would have to rule against the doctors
[21:25:44] <kuudes> because the doctors currently say third doses should only be given to specific risk groups and people over 60 and to them only when there is 6 months from second shot, that is 9 months from first shot
[21:26:09] <kuudes> so my local area has now 13% test positivity and 500-600 cases per 100k over 2 weeks
[21:26:35] <kuudes> and for children 5-9 it is apparently over 1100 per 100k per 7 days, that is 2200 per the normal measure
[21:27:08] <kuudes> tomorrow likely the expert doctors have to rule as ecdc rules and to recommend vaccines for 5-11 year olds
[21:27:20] <kuudes> but likely it is still delayed as the special kids doses only come by christmas
[21:27:29] <kuudes> whereas they are just the adult doses but 1/3
[21:27:45] <kuudes> and indeed you can just take 1/3 of adult dose from adult bottle, as they do in austria
[21:27:53] <kuudes> this feels insane to me.
[21:29:10] <kuudes> downside of legibility is that if the decision process gets hijacked by a death cult, it is bad
[21:29:32] <kuudes> the cabinet has covertly threatened to fire the doctors and select new ones
[21:29:47] <kuudes> but it is nontrivial to fire civil servants, as they are independent
[21:30:14] <kuudes> but gwern, this is why I presume germany is not lacking doses.
[21:30:27] <kuudes> biden had similar problem in usa
[21:30:52] <kuudes> there the answer was to rule that anyone is in risk group, and then later when doctors yielded, allow it for everyone
[21:31:00] <kuudes> still, the time limit is insane as well
[21:31:08] <kuudes> it should be 4 months, not 6 months
[21:31:34] <kuudes> and indeed it is questionable why anyone volunteer should be prevented from a dose especially if they can get a prescription for it

[22:22:48] <ggreer> ah that metallic taste in one side of my mouth... it's been a while
[22:23:26] <adiabatic> you get a booster shot?
[22:23:49] <ggreer> yeah. life is probably gonna suck for a couple days
[22:28:37] <kuudes> congrats!
[22:28:46] <kuudes> take paracetamol if you need to
[22:29:04] <adiabatic> got something scheduled for thursday. moderna this time, because last I checked moderna was just plain better
[22:29:49] <Dyo> >>Gurkenglas: that's law in germany and we have journalism<< do you know of any good (i.e. neutral) independent journalists in germany?

[22:33:32] <ggreer> moderna will fuck you up. like... one of my coworkers was loopy for several days after he came back to work
[22:34:07] <adiabatic> mom wasn't loopy much. I got nothing more than a sore arm from pfizer
[22:34:10] <ggreer> he was bedridden for a couple days. he had a really high fever. I think his brain took a while to get back to normal after that
[22:37:55] <adiabatic> hoo boy, and I have an appointment scheduled for friday
[22:38:13] <gwern> good timing
[22:38:27] <spxtr> I have a friend who got rekt by moderna and another who had almost no symptoms aside from sore arm.
[22:38:33] <adiabatic> granted, it's a guy coming to fix my washer, but still
[22:38:58] <Dyo> what's wrong with your washer?
[22:38:59] <spxtr> You should definitely get the shot during the week and take the next day off of work. Don't ruin a weekend.
[22:39:11] <adiabatic> buttons don't work
[22:40:33] <catern> spxtr: or just get the shot whenever and take the day off whenever and claim you're getting the booster

[23:14:51] <kuudes> adiabatic, go for it
[23:14:59] <kuudes> if it gets too much, take paracetamol etc.
[23:15:06] <kuudes> but indeed moderna has higher dosage than pfizer
[23:15:12] <kuudes> pfizer has 30 units, moderna 100

[23:15:20] <kuudes> on boosters over here they have halved it to 50
[23:15:28] <kuudes> and they recommend against moderna for males under 30
[23:15:39] <kuudes> in any case, avoid exercise for a week after the dose
[23:15:45] <adiabatic> a whole week? why?
[23:16:08] <kuudes> there are the cardio problems
[23:16:20] <kuudes> I guess some days is ok, it is uncertain
[23:16:27] <adiabatic> the heart inflammation that everyone says is the reason you shouldn't take the vax?
[23:16:50] <kuudes> yes. you should take the vax, but you should not go on marathon or take coke just after it
[23:16:59] <kuudes> *cocaine
[23:17:17] <adiabatic> 'take coke' is obvious enough for a native speaker that you're not talking about the soft drink
[23:17:38] <kuudes> indeed, but I felt uncertain and needed to be clear
[23:17:39] <catern> i don't know about that
[23:17:51] <catern> could be unclear
[23:17:55] <adiabatic> I mean, there is the possibility of malicious twisting
[23:18:01] <adiabatic> I'd certainly make a joke like that
[23:18:20] <kuudes> but indeed. moderna is good if you have no reason against it. it is somewhat better than pfizer
[23:18:31] <adiabatic> but if I don't pick hevay things up and put them down on a regular basis my back goes bad
[23:18:33] <kuudes> and you will need all you can get if omicron is as bad as early suggestions
[23:19:00] <kuudes> I guess you could discuss with your doctor, but afaik we do not know what is safe time
[23:19:06] <kuudes> "a couple of days"
[23:19:22] <adiabatic> a walk around the block won't kill me at any rate
[23:19:32] <adiabatic> there's always mild exercise

[23:27:17] <kuudes> yeah, you don't have to be bedridden
[23:27:22] <gwern> I wonder which coke has killed more people
[23:27:26] <kuudes> just don't stress your heart, I would think
[23:27:35] <gwern> probably both are less than the kind you burn
[23:27:44] <kuudes> hoo
[23:28:14] <adiabatic> probably snort-coke. sugar-coke is probably paired with other killers like sweet tea and Fieri knows what else
[23:28:41] <gwern> now there's a poll for you. "Which coke has killed more people? (1) the white stuff; (2) the black stuff; (3) the wet stuff"
[23:29:10] <adiabatic> gwern: if only one of us had a public Twitter profile with a gazillion followers
[23:29:11] <spxtr> I would guess 3 > 2 > 1 but I'm not sure about 3 and 2
[23:30:08] <kuudes> hmm, I guess I should maybe go beg for my fourth dose tomorrow O_o
[23:30:21] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke sadly, I don't think I can come up with a plausible fourth candidate
[23:30:22] <Robomot> Coke - Wikipedia (Coke may refer to:)
[23:30:27] <spxtr> Actually maybe 2 > 3 > 1 simply because it's been around for so much longer.
[23:30:50] <gwern> I didn't know there was an oil 'coke' but I doubt it's really all that different
[23:31:37] <catern> (4) the brothers
[23:32:20] <gwern> koch family? unfortunately, that's far too obscure
[23:32:31] <gwern> I had no idea 'koch' meant 'coke' until that page
[23:33:05] <spxtr> Also the wet stuff is also black, so 2 is a little confusing
[23:33:06] <catern> "koch" is just pronounced "coke"
[23:33:15] <spxtr> And the coke for iron smelting is greyish, no?
[23:33:41] <adiabatic> catern: for the brothers, yes. for the New York mayor (Ed Koch), no (it rhymes with "botch")
[23:33:57] <catern> ah well
[23:34:24] <catern> i don't think the koch brothers have killed many people so
[23:34:39] <catern> (but those are who I meant)
[23:34:47] <gwern> spxtr: no, the confusing is deliberate. that's what makes it a punchline - the sudden flipping of perspective. "wet stuff...? oh. I completely forgot about air pollution and iron manufacturing in my politicized american obsession with orthorexy and the war on drugs"
[23:35:02] <spxtr> I see, carry on then.
[23:35:22] <gwern> "hm, this is a good remember that air pollution kills vastly more people than all of the issues I obsess about."
