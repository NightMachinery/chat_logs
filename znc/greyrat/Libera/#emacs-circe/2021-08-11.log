[12:40:18] <thomasb06> hello. Would you see the error in: https://x0.at/1oLM.el ?
[12:42:52] <wasamasa> thomasb06: OFCT?
[12:43:04] <thomasb06> there's openstack there
[12:43:18] <wasamasa> it's typo'd
[12:43:35] <thomasb06> it's to start to get involved in an open source project
[12:43:51] <thomasb06> ah, there's a typo... let me recheck
[12:44:28] <wasamasa> I'm not sure about the :after-auth parts
[12:45:05] <wasamasa> circe-channels documents that the syntax is ("#channel" :after-auth "#channel2")
[12:45:21] <wasamasa> though, no
[12:45:24] <wasamasa> that should be fine
[12:45:31] <thomasb06> in libera it works
[12:45:57] <thomasb06> maybe it's not meant to be used on two different hosts
[12:46:16] <thomasb06> after all, at the time we all were under freenode
[12:46:20] <wasamasa> what exactly is the problem?
[12:46:36] <thomasb06> in oftc, the channels don't open
[12:46:50] <thomasb06> in libera, all do
[12:46:56] <wasamasa> does it work without after-auth?
[12:47:04] <thomasb06> so I copied-pasted
[12:47:17] <thomasb06> ah, let me try
[12:47:23] <thomasb06> (see ya)
[12:47:26] <wasamasa> yeah, the typo could be it
[12:47:31] <wasamasa> there is "OFTC" in the defaults
[12:47:39] <wasamasa> which sets up the nickserv strings
[12:48:39] <thomasb06> ok, I disconnect and retry

[12:49:56] <thomasb06> still no...
[12:50:05] <thomasb06> in oftc, the channels don't open
[12:50:41] <thomasb06> maybe it was meant to work under only one network
[12:51:24] <thomasb06> wasamasa: but for libera, it goes well though. The :after-auth part is ok
[12:51:34] <wasamasa> so, what's your config now?
[12:52:30] <thomasb06> this one: https://x0.at/F6O-.el
[12:53:47] <wasamasa> still typo'd
[12:54:02] <wasamasa> OFCT is not OFTC
[12:54:04] <thomasb06> but I removed the :after-auth part
[12:54:22] <wasamasa> yeah, but the nickserv part won't work without the nickserv settings
[12:54:48] <wasamasa> look at `circe-network-defaults'
[12:55:09] <wasamasa> it defines masks and challenge strings for nickserv
[12:55:45] <thomasb06> my bad... Sorry the time loss
[12:56:06] <wasamasa> and once that typo is gone, I'm sure that after-auth will magically work again
[12:56:23] <thomasb06> let give a try right now

[13:00:24] <thomasb06> wasamasa: now my config is: https://x0.at/iBLa.el but it still doesn't work. Maybe I can switch Libera and OFTC?
[13:00:40] <wasamasa> hmm
[13:00:50] <wasamasa> at this point I'd enable debug logging and look at the log for hints
[13:01:15] <thomasb06> wow... Let me try switching the configs
[13:01:51] <wasamasa> random question: you don't happen to use any funny non-ascii characters in your password, right
[13:02:16] <thomasb06> only letters low-case...
[13:03:00] <wasamasa> (setq irc-debug-log t)
[13:03:10] <wasamasa> the debug log contains everything, including your credentials
[13:03:15] <thomasb06> and there's an agent running. Ah. under OFTC, my nick is not registered yet
[13:03:21] <wasamasa> lol
[13:03:23] <thomasb06> maybe this is the issue
[13:03:25] <wasamasa> maybe
[13:03:38] <wasamasa> I've had some issues with znc and libera before registering my nick
[13:03:48] <thomasb06> way to go
[13:24:13] <thomasb06> wasamasa: Now I'm registered, time to retry

[13:29:41] <thomasb06> wasamasa: it was the registration. Before asking in the channel, I hesitated to try... But I should have
[13:29:49] <thomasb06> Thank you for your help
[13:31:50] <wasamasa> you're welcome
[13:31:55] <thomasb06> wasamasa: may I add a tiny phrase in the wiki?
[13:32:05] <wasamasa> what do you have in mind?
[13:32:35] <thomasb06> like: «the :after-auth option needs to be registered»
[13:32:49] <wasamasa> I don't think it's the after-auth option, but nickserv options in general
[13:33:40] <thomasb06> say: «nickserv options need to be registered» ?
[13:36:50] <wasamasa> something like that
[13:37:44] <thomasb06> Done: https://github.com/emacs-circe/circe/wiki/Configuration
[13:38:42] <wasamasa> that's grammatically incorrect though
[13:38:48] <wasamasa> it's not the options that need to be registered
[13:38:56] <wasamasa> it's your account that needs to be to make use of these options
[13:40:12] <thomasb06> arg... Then: «The account needs to be registered for the nickserv options to work as expected»
[13:40:24] <wasamasa> yes
[13:40:33] <thomasb06> perfect, I correct the wiki
[13:40:37] <wasamasa> thank you

[15:04:39] <wasamasa> I don't see what that would add
