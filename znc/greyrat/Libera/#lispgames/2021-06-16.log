[00:10:37] <Pixel_Outlaw> Apple is going to flat out drop OpenGL eh?
[00:11:16] <Pixel_Outlaw> I wonder how much that'd break in the Linux world a lot of guys hacked stuff together in OpenGL's immediate mode and yet I think nearly all our 3D stuff is in OpenGL for lisp 
[00:11:37] <Pixel_Outlaw> Even if it's using GLSL it'll die I suppose.

[00:17:38] <borodust> everything that depends on third-party is eventually bitrots
[00:19:28] <borodust> sadly, with graphics this process happens faster, unless you reimplement hardware in software where it can prolong the life of a software piece
[00:19:51] <borodust> opengl is unlikely to see any updates either
[00:34:54] <Pixel_Outlaw> Well the state of simply drawing to the screen is getting worse and worse and worse as far as convenience goes.
[00:38:30] <Pixel_Outlaw> 1980: draw_triangle(...), 1990s glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES); glVertex3f(-1.0f, -0.5f, -4.0f); ... GlEnd(GL_TRIANGLES), 2000's <some GLSL garbage with additional files "write your own damn camera and lighting", Vulkan aka HELL. 
[00:39:27] <borodust> it's still better than writing assembly for each graphics card architecture
[00:39:39] <borodust> but we are getting there :)
[00:39:46] <Pixel_Outlaw> BUT NOT writing assembly for the CPU to manipulate a pixel buffer. Not by a long shot.
[00:40:10] <Pixel_Outlaw> Like seriously, it's pretty bad abstraction wise when assembly is shorter than Vulkan.
[00:40:41] <Pixel_Outlaw> You can peek and poke a raytraced (slow) masterpiece into Amiga in less lines of code.
[00:41:00] <Pixel_Outlaw> And have every feature Vulkan probably offeres since you're doing the math anyway.
[00:41:32] <borodust> vulkan is kinda resource management api
[00:42:08] <Pixel_Outlaw> I think I want Klingon. :P
[00:42:16] <Pixel_Outlaw> Slow, simple, honorable. 
[00:42:58] <borodust> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:43:55] <borodust> but really, you can use something like windows GDI, or X 2d drawing stuff
[00:43:56] <Pixel_Outlaw> It seems everyone else is just using 800MB of RAM in a web browser to do graphics programming so from an application standpoint the only people left are those trying to make AAA titles.
[00:43:58] <borodust> for high level things
[00:44:18] <Pixel_Outlaw> SFML and Allegro are pretty nice for abstracting that stuff.
[00:44:50] <borodust> you don't need to use opengl/vulkan at this point at all
[00:44:57] <borodust> directly, that is
[00:45:33] <borodust> it's too low level)
[01:05:22] <|3b|> Pixel_Outlaw: much easier to write draw_triangle or begin+vertex+end on top of glsl/vulkan than other way around :)
[01:05:56] * |3b| does (with-draw (:triangles) ...) instead of begin/end though
[01:06:20] <|3b|> hopefully one of these days i'll get that "done" enough for other people to use reasonably :/
