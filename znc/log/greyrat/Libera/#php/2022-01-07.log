[00:01:23] <TinoDidriksen> That should work. That doesn't change the orientation - it actually rotates. Check that the file is actually saved.

[00:03:12] <Howdy_McGee> Sorry, I guess I don't understand what you mean. What should work?
[00:03:30] <Howdy_McGee> Seems like the file is saved. If I open the file locally in my image viewer it seems rotated properly.
[00:03:56] <Howdy_McGee> I've also tried calling `$image->stripImage();` before ->writeImage() but that didn't seem to help.
[00:06:34] <TinoDidriksen> Your code should work, and you've verified that it does work by opening the file locally.
[00:06:42] <TinoDidriksen> So it must be a caching issue.
[00:07:25] <Howdy_McGee> Could be, but I've opened this in Internet Explorer which I never use and it shows the original image instead of the rotated image. I'm not running any caching solutions, it's all local.
[00:07:54] <Howdy_McGee> I'm thinking I need to update the EXIF data with the proper orientation but if I can't get the orientation after rotation then it won't matter.
[00:08:39] <Howdy_McGee> Ah, FML. You're right

[00:09:14] <Howdy_McGee> The image is actually still pointing to the server image and not my local image, my rewrites didn't take.
[00:09:30] <Howdy_McGee> Thanks for verifying though!

[13:58:11] <CoJaBo> If your data isn't big and your algo isn't exceptionally terrible, it's unlikely to be noticed. Usually best to write clear code and only optimize when it's actually needed

[17:14:11] <stenno> so can i turn an array of arrays like [['key1','value1'],['key2','value2'], ...] into an object ['key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2', ...] ?

[17:40:08] <da_wunder> or just use - https://www.php.net/file_put_contents - that will truncate file by default
[17:45:21] <panella32> I'm not sure I can describe it well enough but my script creates and opens a txt file (called urls.txt) using fopen("a") and writes to it 'multiple' times throughout different parts of my script.
[17:45:37] <panella32> of course using fopen("a) is fine but in case I re-run the script it writes everything to the end of urls.txt and add them to the file without wiping it first.
[17:46:55] <panella32> AllenJB To be accurate the script open url.txt in 3 different part of the code. I afraid that using "w" wipes the previous steps' urls
[17:48:29] <AllenJB> Could you open the file just once (then pass the filehandle around)? Or alternatively, open the file with truncate enabled once at the beginning of the script, then append for the rest.

[22:24:00] <Na_Klar> I need a VoIP solution for my server. Is there any lightwight php project out there?
[22:24:41] <Na_Klar> principially it must just be able to stream audio from client to client via the server. one connection would be enough tbh
[22:26:02] <Naktibalda> I don't think that PHP is the right tool for this job
[22:26:51] <Na_Klar> why? php can handle udp quite well
[22:28:28] <Naktibalda> and we aren't in business of recommending projects, libraries and other things written in PHP, we help to write PHP code
[22:28:45] <Na_Klar> that's true, indeed
[22:29:00] <biberu> why does it have to be php?
[22:29:23] <Na_Klar> it doesn't have to. but I can code php best. ruby would be an option as well.
[22:29:55] <biberu> you need to edit this thing?
[22:30:28] <Na_Klar> most likely. but maybe not, depends. as long as it is foss it should work out.

[22:35:33] <Togra> if I use file_put_contents(filepath, LOCK_EX);, what happens if the same script is loaded by another person and they try to write to that same file? I assume it freezes and waits for the first, then does its write and then returns back?
[22:35:48] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@2a01:e34:ec18:50c0:b556:3787:c580:eab6)
[22:36:07] <Togra> nothing else will be messing with these files except this php script, a lot of my googling landed on very deep, interesting conversations about file locks but that I think were more complicated than I needed
[22:36:15] <Na_Klar> Togra: the script will block till it can finish the write or times out
[22:36:25] <Togra> ah ok
[22:36:57] <Togra> is it necessary to use LOCK_EX with file_get_contents() as well or is it more of just a write thing?
[22:37:17] <Na_Klar> why would your lock a file which gets read?
[22:37:25] <Na_Klar> red*
[22:37:56] <Togra> because file locks and multiple people trying to use one file at once is all new ground for me
[22:37:58] <Togra> :<
[22:38:03] <TML> Na_Klar: I would normally not look to either PHP or Ruby as VoIP solutions; neither is terribly good at the kind of real-time demands a VoIP solution usually requires
[22:38:53] <Na_Klar> Togra: there is no need to lock read-only files. they can be read by many instances at once. most systems cache the read on top of that.
[22:39:32] <Togra> oh neat, ok cool
[22:39:43] <Togra> get would still respect put's file lock I assume either way?
[22:39:54] <Na_Klar> +TML: So what architecture is recommendable? How do these camsites run their a/v stuff?
[22:40:00] <TML> Togra: Only you actually know whether or not it's problematic for your application to read from the file while it's being written to; however, as a general rule, for multi-user systems, I would say stay away from file-locking and use a system that is inherently designed to deal with concurrent access, such as a database.
[22:40:09] <Na_Klar> Togra: yes it will
[22:40:13] <Togra> ah ok
[22:40:20] <TML> Na_Klar: I don't know what "these camsites" refers to, so I can't help you there

[22:41:15] <__adrian> you mean like video chat?
[22:41:21] <Na_Klar> nooo
[22:41:24] <TML> for VoIP I would suggest Asterisk
[22:41:51] <TML> it's the primary backbone of most VoIP systems
[22:42:13] <Na_Klar> yeah look neat on the first sight. but not foss ofc.
[22:42:28] <TML> Yes it is…

[22:44:10] <Na_Klar> ah yes, I see. thanks for the hint.
[22:46:03] <TML> but again, I don't know what "chat roulette" or "camsites" are, so I can't at all verify that Asterisk is going to fit your use-case
