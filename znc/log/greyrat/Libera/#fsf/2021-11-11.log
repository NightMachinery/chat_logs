[00:20:26] <tpefreedom> Are there any projects trying to create a graphics card that works with exclusively free software?
[00:21:09] <Armand> I doubt a graphics card would care that much...
[00:23:47] <tpefreedom> So we could do 3D modeling/animation or GPGPU simulations on a fully free/libre system w/o drivers that barely work.

[09:14:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> also SARS-CoV-2 mutates and not enough ppl got the vaccine
[09:14:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> so the normal is just temporarely as it already mutates
[09:14:42] <DiffieHellman> Armand: Lets be honest, why is it that you smoke? What reason?
[09:14:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> and 78% is not even close to enough protection to kill it in the wild
[09:15:09] <leah> we're all dead anyway. global warming
[09:15:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: bcs he's mofo that hates me -w-
[09:15:12] <kittyblam> imagine if the US handled this well
[09:15:15] <kittyblam> leah: no we are not
[09:15:22] <Armand> DiffieHellman: Because I want to.
[09:15:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> leah: nah we can manage global warming
[09:15:24] <DiffieHellman> Sadly most of the vaccines are proprietary, some aren't though.
[09:15:37] <leah> can and will are different things
[09:15:43] <kittyblam> stop buying into that corporate crap, there is still quite a bit of time and there is no chance we are hitting a runaway venus-level deathtrap
[09:15:46] <DiffieHellman> Armand: That isn't a reason. Also, don't start sentences with "because".
[09:15:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> hmm do we have a programming language that compiles in DNA code
[09:15:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> might be fun
[09:15:51] <leah> i think we are going to let it get worse until it's too late
[09:15:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> i would get wings and two ehh things
[09:15:58] <Armand> I got both shots of the AZ.. Waiting on the booster now.
[09:16:03] <leah> and then the human population will go to 5% of what it is now
[09:16:06] <enyc> leah: it was a widespread concerted effort......
[09:16:08] <Armand> DiffieHellman: No, that's definitely a reason.
[09:16:13] <Armand> Because it is a reason.
[09:16:15] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: mRNA can be supplied to cells to produce RNA.
[09:16:23] <leah> our world will survive. but we will be reduced to a very poor quality of life
[09:16:33] <DiffieHellman> Armand: Be honest with me. Tell me the true reason and how you got started.
[09:16:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: RNA doesn't produce DNA different architectures
[09:16:46] <Armand> DiffieHellman: I already did.
[09:16:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's just replicating the viral response of an immunoblobin that is compatible with SARS-CoV-2 to neutralize it 
[09:16:57] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: You can use mRNA to produce RNA that reverse transcripts DNA though
[09:17:16] <kittyblam> I think the only issue relevant for this chat
[09:17:20] <M6piz7wk[m]> yes same way you can turn shit into an elephat
[09:17:22] <kittyblam> is the fucking vaccine patents and shit fuck them
[09:17:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> *elephant
[09:17:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> you need a lot of it and the end result smels
[09:17:35] *** Joins: Meli (~meli@user/meli)
[09:17:37] <leah> i know my history. and i know how people think. we let stuff get worse until we have no choice to act
[09:17:43] <kittyblam> anyone should be able to be free to distribute their own
[09:17:47] <leah> we are doomed
[09:18:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> like we can always live in the water again 
[09:18:12] <M6piz7wk[m]> but meh
[09:18:19] <kittyblam> leah nobody is doomed lol
[09:18:20] <kittyblam> well
[09:18:26] <leah> i've seen reports that most of the world will be uninhabitable by 2100
[09:18:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> i am confident in US and EU doing enough to mitigate global warming
[09:18:27] <kittyblam> not everyone in the slightest
[09:18:31] <DiffieHellman> kittyblam: I mean the Phizer mRNA strand is public domain, too bad the machines to make the mRNA are all ultra proprietary.
[09:18:38] <leah> unless we act
[09:18:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> also confident in china 
[09:18:45] <leah> but i don't see us acting fast enough
[09:18:47] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: I wasn't aware of that
[09:18:58] <Armand> DiffieHellman: I think it's Pfizer.. ?
[09:19:18] <DiffieHellman> Yes, I sometimes make typos
[09:19:22] <kittyblam> leah: doomerism is a shiny "new" weapon of the rich
[09:19:34] <Armand> fair
[09:19:41] <kittyblam> there is stuff that can be done,
[09:19:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: what's ultra proprietary on 6 small viles and inhibitor lol
[09:19:48] <DiffieHellman> leah: No matter how humanity tries, we can't make the world uninhabitable. We can wipe out all those low lying islands and make tons of animals extinct though.
[09:19:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> 20 USD per home-made vaccine
[09:20:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> just the trials take milions+
[09:20:09] <kittyblam> but things will be much more likely to be done if investors don't control so much and the rich don't exist.
[09:20:48] <leah> DiffieHellman: the future happens very fast
[09:20:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: what more do you even expect from em
[09:21:02] <leah> someone born today will be 20 in no time. and then 30.
[09:21:25] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: we can make the world uninhabitable but global warming and climate change aren't even *close* to what is necessary
[09:21:28] <leah> and they make someone else become born
[09:21:39] <Armand> Just glad my kids can't get covid. :D
[09:21:48] <leah> our generation will be able to live well enough i think. it's the next generation that's fucked
[09:21:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: they an
[09:21:51] <DiffieHellman> kittyblam: Even if you let off all the nukes, you can't make all areas uninhabital.
[09:21:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> *can
[09:21:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> just have more reactice immune system
[09:21:57] <Armand> Can't
[09:21:57] <DiffieHellman> *uninhabitable
[09:21:59] <Armand> CANNOT
[09:22:02] <Armand> Impossible.
[09:22:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> which doesn't matter bcs it's particle amount thing
[09:22:15] <leah> but it's not extinction that scares me
[09:22:21] <leah> what scares me are the years just before that
[09:22:23] <Armand> Literally, unfeasible.
[09:22:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> well tell them to go kiss random caughing people and watchem die then :p
[09:22:28] <leah> when the crises are in progress
[09:22:30] <leah> and people panic
[09:22:44] <leah> and governments become ruthless
[09:22:46] <Armand> They won't even kiss us, let alone random people.
[09:22:49] <Armand> lmao
[09:22:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: bcs u r troll who doesn't have kids?
[09:22:57] <Armand> No.
[09:23:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> sure
[09:23:02] <leah> life will be no longer worth it, long before it all actually ends
[09:23:03] <DiffieHellman> leah: The UK government is ruthless enough.
[09:23:04] <Armand> Stupid troll-bot
[09:23:06] <DiffieHellman> already
[09:23:10] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: there are certain weapons that could. And outside of that if you actively tried to engineer global warming you might be able to reach a tipping point where over the course of a long time it literally reaches venus level habitability, but, again, there is
[09:23:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: they would kiss me under 2 min -w-
[09:23:22] <kittyblam> no sign of either being a risk right now in the slightest, particularly the second one not being a risk
[09:23:28] <Armand> M6piz7wk[m]: No.
[09:23:34] <leah> and by current estimates, that starts happening in about 20 years
[09:23:42] <leah> unless sufficient action is taken now, to prevent it
[09:23:44] <Armand> They wouldn't even let you close... Never mind that I wouldn't let you near them.

[09:24:12] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: since when does Uk have a government? Last time i checked it was a circus with kermit the frog in UN talking about climate change 
[09:24:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> fucking retard 
[09:24:14] <leah> 20 years happens so very fast indeed
[09:24:19] <kittyblam> we are reaching a fairly bad point and have already reached yes, but not extinction of all life level of bad
[09:24:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> ehh
[09:24:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> *hugging nice person
[09:24:28] <DiffieHellman> Probably what's going to happen is that we get a nice 2C warming, that releases all that methane on the bottom of the ocean.
[09:24:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> don't ban me
[09:24:40] <Armand> Do ban.
[09:24:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> NooooOO~
[09:24:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> also pretty sure that we can curse at boris johnson at this point
[09:25:16] <leah> but hey
[09:25:18] <leah> we'll see
[09:25:40] <leah> i plan to live it up, in the meantime. unless i figure out a way that i can make a difference
[09:26:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: i am more concerned about something super deadly released from the ice bergs in the ocean 
[09:26:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs those were frozen for like milions of years
[09:26:40] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: I doubt much will be bio-compatible with humans sadly. 
[09:26:48] <Armand> Great thing about freedom of speech... We can cuss Boris Johnson any time we please.
[09:27:09] <DiffieHellman> The UK doesn't actually have a freedom of speech law or declaration I'm pretty sure.
[09:27:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> oh is that how freedom of speech is supposed to work
[09:27:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> ok
[09:27:15] <Armand> Wrong
[09:27:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> fuck boris johnson that stupid frog 
[09:27:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> if i get ban i sue you for giving me the confidence 
[09:27:49] <Armand> We have the written freedom of speech, excluding making threats of violence, or encouraging such.
[09:28:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> ye but none gives a damn about it unless it's on the TV

[09:36:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> ofc you see moon runes when u r in medieval ages 
[09:36:20] <Armand> Don't even have an ISO for it.
[09:36:24] <DiffieHellman> Armand: Better get started with the time you have left; https://youshould.installgentoo.net
[09:36:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: The gentoo's iso is older then linux
[09:36:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> install Guix instead ^-^
[09:36:57] <Armand> I'm sure a good 40+ years should be enough.
[09:37:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> INSTALL. GUIX. I. SAID 🔪
[09:37:27] <DiffieHellman> Statistically it's 4-50 years, but I'm going for 5 myself
[09:37:30] <Armand> I was trying out Arch, but that wasn't exactly a good experience.

[09:38:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> just run the script~
[09:38:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> and whoo guix
[09:38:10] <M6piz7wk[m]> remove whenever
[09:38:15] <Armand> But Gentoo is definitely on the list.
[09:38:25] <DiffieHellman> I prefer OS's that I can hand install.
[09:38:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> idc do the guix
[09:38:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> 🔪
[09:38:35] <Armand> As-is CoreOS.
[09:39:15] <Armand> Not sure what else I can play around with, except OS/2 Warp. :D
[09:39:16] * leah compiled linux with her hands
[09:39:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> Dooo guix!! Dooo Guix!!
[09:39:27] <DiffieHellman> OS/2 warp is proprietary
[09:39:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> Guixxxxx~~~~
[09:39:38] <Armand> Yes, leah... I have tried LFS before. :D
[09:39:44] <DiffieHellman> I hand tune my kernel .config of course.
[09:39:47] <Armand> DiffieHellman: Riiiiiight... and?
[09:39:53] <leah> no i mean
[09:40:00] <leah> i reached into my computer with my hands
[09:40:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> stfu about LFS, do guixxxx
[09:40:15] <Armand> leah: Fnaar!
[09:40:15] <DiffieHellman> GLFS would just be a slower versions of Gentoo for me.
[09:40:17] <leah> and i manually computed every x86 assembly instruction
[09:40:22] <Armand> hehehe
[09:40:27] <leah> laboriously executing GCC by hand
[09:40:52] <leah> now *that* is linux from scratch
[09:40:57] <DiffieHellman> leah: Why would you use the 32bit compatibility layer set on your AMD64 CPU?
[09:41:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> i just wrote a scratchy program and let it scratch an OS~
[09:41:13] <leah> because 32-bit binaries use less RAM
[09:41:20] <DiffieHellman> Depends really
[09:41:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> pff u r boring won't even do guix
[09:41:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> -w-
[09:41:36] <Armand> Might start on the new LFS build when I'm off work.
[09:41:45] <DiffieHellman> AMD64 gives you more registers, so you don't have to keep dumping stuff onto the stack etc and using RAM.
[09:42:10] <DiffieHellman> Sure 64bit pointers take up more space, but you can always just use 32bit pointers if wanted.

[09:44:13] <Armand> That reminds me.. I should give my buddy a prod and see how things are developing with the 8-bit CPU design. :)
[09:44:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> is it even CPU if it's 8 bit
[09:44:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> more like FPGA
[09:45:28] <Armand> If you don't know how development works, go find something you might know even one thing about.
[09:45:29] <DiffieHellman> 8-bit CPU designs are probably actually feasible to build by hand, 64 bit designs need a FGPA unless you are insane.
[09:45:36] <Armand> ^
[09:45:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: thus why i found you~
[09:45:45] <Armand> 8-bit CPUs are fairly easy.
[09:45:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> hmm
[09:46:00] <Armand> Like, DUH.. of course you use FPGA.
[09:46:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> tell him to open-source their design so that i can make it then
[09:46:13] <Armand> Anyone worth a damn would use FPGA for development.
[09:46:15] <DiffieHellman> Please no open sourcing.

[09:53:01] <DiffieHellman> kittyblam: I re-read those two parts and I don't see anything wrong.
[09:53:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: bloody retarded.. literally says it has a backdoor to ring-0
[09:53:21] <Armand> Literally doesn't
[09:53:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> the dev literally said it
[09:53:34] <Armand> Link.
[09:53:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> lemme find it
[09:53:39] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: the issue is they imply application to everything, when in reality non-unionized corporations and the likes shouldn't apply, their use of free software consistently ruins other peoples freedoms.
[09:53:39] <Armand> 3
[09:53:40] <Armand> 2
[09:53:41] <Armand> 1
[09:53:43] <Armand> ...
[09:53:45] <kittyblam> well, not just their use, but rather
[09:53:53] <kittyblam> their modification and distribution as well
[09:54:01] <kittyblam> I know thats going to be quite controversial here tho lol
[09:54:08] *** Quits: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:54:27] <kittyblam> I otherwise totally agree with the points laid out.
[09:54:32] <DiffieHellman> kittyblam: The types of people that use software for harmful purposes will just use the software in breach of its license. Adding restrictions on that would breach freedom 0.
[09:54:33] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[09:54:53] <DiffieHellman> *adding restrictions on usage would just breach
[09:55:18] <kittyblam> thats why I said or rather modifying and redistributing in particular

[09:55:40] <M6piz7wk[m]> > , and the Quectel EG25-G LTE modem runs its own closed-source OS.
[09:55:50] <kittyblam> there are some social domain licenses that would otherwise be a free license if it wasn't for this particular disagreement on universal application vs just applying to honest groups
[09:55:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> Literal modem.. running Closed-source OS that has full access to ring-0
[09:56:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> so wireless backdoor 
[09:56:23] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: Yes, there exists no proprietary modem, but on the librem etc it's attached via usb or UART.
[09:56:29] <DiffieHellman> *no modem that isn't proprietary
[09:56:52] <kittyblam> honest groups being very broad there, more of everyone but the few worst groups like especially non-unionized giant tech companies
[09:56:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/modem
[09:56:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> top 113 of em
[09:57:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> So there is a shit ton of FLOSS modems
[09:57:19] <Armand> So, you literally didn't understand any of that.
[09:57:23] <Armand> Ok.... That's cool.
[09:57:28] *** Quits: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[09:57:34] <DiffieHellman> For the pine64, there's a usb connection for data and I2C for audio and that's the best separation you can get.
[09:57:46] <DiffieHellman> The modem has no access to the main SoC that way,
[09:57:58] <Armand> Indeed.
[09:58:14] <Armand> Basic reading comprehension is a massive benefit to progress.
[09:58:36] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: the modem is on the PCB and without ECAD Files you can't dismiss supply chair attack
[09:58:39] <M6piz7wk[m]> or built-in backdoor
[09:58:49] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[09:59:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs that's the best place to put backdoor to where it has wireless access and ring-0 injecting
[09:59:07] <Armand> Liar
[09:59:15] <Armand> It literally doesn't. Ever.
[09:59:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> prove it
[09:59:25] <M6piz7wk[m]> i dare you
[09:59:28] <Armand> Don't need to.
[09:59:38] <Armand> Burden of proof lies upon the one making the claim.
[09:59:42] <Armand> So.... "prove it".
[09:59:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> get the PCB and run it on the CNC machine and make super high resolution pictures of each pass
[09:59:50] <DiffieHellman> Yes, all computer hardware can be arguably backdoored, but there's nothing special about the Pine64
[09:59:51] <kittyblam> also the GPL is way too soft on patents and the such, would be nice here if
[09:59:51] <Armand> ... which you can't, of course.
[10:00:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> i've proved it already it's self evident 
[10:00:03] <Armand> Nope.
[10:00:07] <Armand> You did nothing.
[10:00:17] *** Joins: eric15342335 (~123er@user/eric15342335)
[10:00:22] <Armand> No evidence, at all.
[10:00:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> the only way to disprove it is to have ECAD files or mill the PCB and make high resolution pics
[10:00:27] <Armand> Just a weak supposition.
[10:00:39] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: Yes, but that's the same as with any hardware.
[10:00:39] <Armand> No, that would be how YOU PROVE it.
[10:00:50] <kittyblam> it treated individuals differently than companies, that for-profit companies would have to abandoned a more broad scope of patents and the likes but individuals wouldn't have the burden
[10:00:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> u r fasist and supporter of non-free that violates user security and privacy -w-
[10:00:56] <DiffieHellman> Even with the ECAD files, how would you prove that the PCB that you have matches?
[10:00:58] <Armand> I do not need to *disprove* something which cannot be asserted as factual.
[10:01:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: nope powerpc-notebook.org is different
[10:01:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: by making it at home
[10:01:23] <DiffieHellman> So then do that then?
[10:01:25] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: it's self evident!
[10:01:30] <Armand> No it isn't
[10:01:40] <M6piz7wk[m]> do you even logic
[10:01:45] <Armand> Considering the lack of any evidence at all.
[10:01:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> you have a piece of hardware which you have no idea what it does
[10:01:52] <Armand> Logically speaking, it's baseless.
[10:01:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> and you telling me i am supposed to disprove it's not something malicious
[10:02:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> that's futile discussion by design
[10:02:23] <Armand> No, I'm saying you need to prove your claim.
[10:02:30] <Armand> Like... people have to in court.
[10:02:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> more logical is it being assumed compromised unless proven otherwise
[10:02:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> which is how the whole CS security works
[10:02:34] <Armand> No.
[10:02:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> -w-
[10:02:34] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: Yes everything it botnet, but the Pine64 is nothing more botnet then anything else, so your claims are little more than trolling.
[10:02:41] <DiffieHellman> *is no more
[10:02:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> -.-
[10:02:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> fine
[10:02:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> get pinephone enjoy 
[10:02:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> -.-
[10:03:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> don't blame me when someone uses that against you
[10:03:18] <DiffieHellman> I don't even have a pinephone.
[10:03:20] <Armand> I don't need a Pinephone.
[10:03:27] <Armand> I have a Pixel 6 Pro.
[10:03:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> trolls
[10:03:36] <Armand> No, there's only one of you.
[10:03:37] <DiffieHellman> I'm considering getting a precursor when they're released and stripping out all the Rust.
[10:03:39] <M6piz7wk[m]> scumbag
[10:03:43] <DiffieHellman> and installing Gentoo
[10:03:48] <Armand> Ohhhh, nice.
[10:04:03] <Armand> I still want an A64FX desktop. :P
[10:04:26] <Armand> Heck, even a single server will do.
[10:05:05] * M6piz7wk[m] is disgusted by the stupidity of this chat and goes to play games

[10:08:30] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:08:44] <Armand> I'm reasonably sure the A64FX hardware isn't FOSS.
[10:08:54] <Armand> Considering it's Fujitsu...
[10:09:12] <DiffieHellman> No hardware can bey free software.
[10:09:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: yes on stadia
[10:09:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs free software games suck
[10:09:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> do game jam competetion to fix that
[10:09:48] <DiffieHellman> Now this is some good bait.
[10:09:53] <Armand> DiffieHellman: Errr, yeah... but, you know what I mean. lol
[10:10:12] <Armand> Obvs, it's an ARM-based CPU.
[10:11:07] <DiffieHellman> It's most probable that the A64FX doesn't work without nonfree blobs, or have fully free drivers, but I haven't checked.
[10:12:23] <Armand> Stuff like the Tofu interconnect is patented up the jacksie
[10:14:31] <Armand> Still want one, just because it's real BEAST MODE hardware. :D

[15:21:58] <DiffieHellman> Tor is centralized around the consensus nodes, but of course you don't mention that.
[15:22:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> > There are a few centralized or limited resources (some inside I2P, some not)
[15:22:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> that could be attacked or used as a vector for attacks.

They reference https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3260807 and say the reason was because "schools are using Google Forms for testing, and the kids can see the right answers in the forms, so to address that, we
[19:03:13] <Guest88> want to prevent students from reading source code."

[19:38:10] <GoatAvenger> it baffles my mind as to why any corporation would have any interest in Linux at all, when freebsd has been openly available to them for decades
[19:38:58] <GoatAvenger> probably the only reason is because of all the opensource idiots that thought cooperating with sociopathic paper entity persons would be anything but roses and honey
[19:39:00] <tricon> M6piz7wk[m]: Yes, in that ngrok provides the HTTP or HTTPS endpoint and simply forwards packets through the tunnel. It's convenient for devs that don't have a VPS for tunneling public requests; or don't want to or can't run a webserver published on their public IP (which may rotate).

[19:50:13] <nomagno> Corporations (Amazon is the biggest offender) have figured out how to use the GPL family as an euphemism for noncommercial.

[22:59:05] <Noisytoot> KE0VVT, How is the arch package manager more foreign than others?
[22:59:28] <KE0VVT> kompowiec: You can tell it's from the 80s.  It has no sense of style.  All lowercase, just a portmanteau of words from every major language.  No regard for sound.
[23:00:01] <KE0VVT> kompowiec: I just don't get why they couldn't just use APT or RPM.
[23:00:02] <kompowiec> it's supposed to be useful, not pretty.

[23:00:34] <Noisytoot> KE0VVT, Seperating lowercase and uppercase letters would make it not be audiovisually isomorphic
[23:01:03] <KE0VVT> kompowiec: That's what I mean, the total disregard of aesthetics for pure function… It’s so 80s.
[23:01:20] <Noisytoot> KE0VVT, Why should they use apt or RPM? Many other distros don't.

[23:01:30] <Noisytoot> apt and rpm are not any more standard than pacman or guix
[23:01:52] <kompowiec> debian IMO has a badly performed move to systemd. I have always had problems with it after any update.
[23:02:02] <Noisytoot> If you want apt or rpm you can just use Debian or (a deblobbed version of) Fedora.

[23:02:54] <KE0VVT> I should really automate the installation of the kernel.
[23:03:08] <kompowiec> Noisytoot, basically, RPM is supported even on IBM AIX now.
[23:03:40] <kompowiec> i had fedora but it's unstable pain 
[23:04:17] <KE0VVT> kompowiec: Are you able to get Linux Libre on CentOS Stream?
[23:04:27] <kompowiec> broadcom... ugh
[23:04:46] <KE0VVT> I've never run into that problem.
[23:05:06] <KE0VVT> kompowiec: Have you had issues with SELinux and Guix?
[23:05:19] <kompowiec> Guix i never tested tbh
[23:06:50] <kompowiec> i checked, probably you can't install linux libre just like that.
[23:07:37] <tpefreedom> Why centos stream though?
[23:07:46] <tpefreedom> What about trisquel?
[23:07:48] <KE0VVT> kompowiec: It had hiccups even on Fedora, which has official support up to Fedora 35.  I want to help package it for Fedora 36 and later, but… I suck at packaging.
[23:08:40] <KE0VVT> tpefreedom: Trisquel is poorly maintained and new contributors are turned away.
[23:08:43] <kompowiec> i hate packaging in each distro. Maybe slackware is the only exception, because he's binary tarballs are portable.
[23:09:02] <djatropine> i love trisquel
[23:09:32] <kompowiec> well I was using the official debian from version 6 to 10.
[23:09:50] <KE0VVT> Trisquel looks pretty, but it is so poorly maintained, and anyone who contributes has to wait a long time for quidam to approve changes.
[23:10:07] <djatropine> Trisqeul works qutie well on everything ive thrown at it.
[23:10:28] <KE0VVT> It's not in line with the current Ubuntu LTS.
[23:10:34] <quidam> KE0VVT: not just me approving changes
[23:11:15] <tpefreedom> KE0VVT, Has anyone tried forking it? Or creating another fuully free distro based on fedora (now that blag is dead)?
[23:11:24] <djatropine> maybe fork blag? :D
[23:11:28] <KE0VVT> Trisquel used to follow even the latest Ubuntu release.  Now, it cannot even keep up with the Ubuntu LTS.
[23:11:31] <kompowiec> I've always wondered why alleged "power user" distributions are practically always rolling.
[23:11:33] <tpefreedom> Or what about devuan. That's basically debian w/o systemd.
[23:11:57] <djatropine> i'm a fan of dragora and dynebolic/puredyne
[23:12:11] <KE0VVT> tpefreedom: I think it would be possible to make a Fedora Remix (NOT Spin, NOT Lab) that is fully free.
[23:13:08] <KE0VVT> kompowiec: Maybe power users have unlimited sysadmin time. :P
[23:13:40] <kompowiec> i had devuan, it was fine but sysv it going to hell.
[23:13:48] <kompowiec> and don't support RC init
[23:13:57] <kompowiec> which i loved with slackware
[23:14:03] <tpefreedom> What is bad about openrc?
[23:14:08] <tpefreedom> And what about runit?
[23:14:31] <kompowiec> RC it itsn't OpenRC. It's more like RC with FreeBSD
[23:14:32] <djatropine> oh i recently made my first donation to the fsf :D
[23:14:49] <KE0VVT> I don't know… With the rise of Flatpak, I might be able to get away with Trisquel's giant lag, and just focus on making a new repo Flatland, containing only free software, to replace Flathub.
[23:15:03] <kompowiec> djatropine, I wrote an e-mail to get the account number, unfortunately no answer.
[23:15:09] <tpefreedom> Good idea KE0VVT 
[23:15:13] <KE0VVT> But, meh.  I'm not going to distro hop anymore.  Fedora isn't going anywhere.
[23:16:05] <KE0VVT> Believe it or not, Flatpak is not just for Spotify.  It's great for getting up-to-date user applications onto ancient OSes like Trisquel.
[23:16:12] <KE0VVT> …and RHEL.
[23:16:16] <kompowiec> Currently, the only advantage I can see over debian compared to RHEL-based is that it does indeed offer distro with free software only.

[23:17:41] *** luca0N is now known as Guest5645
[23:18:09] <kompowiec> i had rocky before i start using centos stream but it was too slow for me.
[23:18:28] <kompowiec> many things I couldn't compile from source because of obsolete packages.
[23:18:54] <KE0VVT> To me, CentOS Stream was a good thing.  Increase revenue from large companies, let regular people use real RHEL, and don't let CentOS fall behind RHEL as it tended to do.
[23:19:17] <kompowiec> i agree
[23:19:21] <kompowiec> it was good decision
[23:19:53] <KE0VVT> Falling behind is why Trisquel, a downstream, is having issues.
[23:20:12] <KE0VVT> I mean, being a downstream is why Trisquel is falling behind.
[23:20:37] <tpefreedom> Why not just soft fork debian and produce a rebranded image that ships main?
[23:20:54] <kompowiec> i used trisquel once, CD version it was a pretty bad experience. Especially midori
[23:20:56] <tpefreedom> And a modified debian installer.
[23:21:07] <tpefreedom> So that it doesn't recommend nonfree software.
[23:22:04] <kompowiec> basically you can copy all debian except non-free repo and you're at home.
[23:23:28] <kompowiec> > Maybe power users have unlimited sysadmin time. :P
[23:23:33] <kompowiec> indeed. that was the reason why I had to give up slackware.
