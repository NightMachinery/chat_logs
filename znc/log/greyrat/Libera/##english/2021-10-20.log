[00:06:45] <chat> fentanyl meant to say: Is this sentence correct? Finding a node in the tree whose key is maximum or minimum in the entire tree is a critical operation.
[00:06:57] <fentanyl> ^
[00:07:00] <FLHerne> fentanyl: "which is maximum or minimum' reads a oh never mind

[00:08:05] <FLHerne> hm, still applies to the revised version
[00:08:32] <fentanyl> hmm..what?
[00:08:34] <FLHerne> pedantically, I think that should be "is maximal or minimal" or "is the maximum or minimum"
[00:09:04] <nomagno> fentanyl: it sounds gramatically correct, but I don't think that use of the words "maximum" and "minimum" is right
[00:09:13] <FLHerne> "in the tree" twice seems redundant, not from a grammar perspective, just reading
[00:10:01] <nomagno> The entire sentence is redundant, also maximum and maximal are the same thing... I guess it makes it sound better
[00:10:26] <FLHerne> "Finding the node in the tree which has the largest or smallest key is a critical operation" ?
[00:10:58] <nomagno> That sounds good to me
[00:11:17] <FLHerne> hm, 'a node' could be important if the largest value isn't unique
[00:11:33] <fentanyl> To be very specific, here is the occurance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree#Maximum_and_minimum
[00:12:03] <nomagno> However English is very ambiguous in this regard. That sentence can imply "there is one of each" or "there can only be one or the other"
[00:12:06] <FLHerne> As it's written there seems fine to me
[00:12:19] <nomagno> OR vs XOR
[00:12:22] <nomagno> The eternal debate
[00:12:37] <fentanyl> FLHerne: I see.
[00:12:42] <FLHerne> but what's in the article is different from either version of what you wrote here :p
[00:13:03] <fentanyl> FLHerne: Well, I guess I failed to generalize it.
[00:13:24] <FLHerne> "Following is a pseudo code" is slightly wrong, but perfectly comprehensible
[00:14:33] <FLHerne> ("pseudocode" is one word and not a countable noun)
[00:15:02] <fentanyl> i see.
[00:15:31] <FLHerne> so should be "Following is pseudocode for the operations" or so
[00:16:10] <fentanyl> alright, will change.

[19:31:56] <huf> even programming languages are barely regulated

[19:33:55] <twb> huf: well, some programming languages are
[19:34:05] <twb> e.g. ISO 9899:2011
[19:34:26] <huf> how much does that affect what goes on in the trenches?
[19:35:07] <huf> compilers target standards but never reach them, programmers write whatever the fuck seems to work
[19:35:26] <twb> Well, it mattered a lot for ISO 9899:1990
[19:35:47] <twb> Monopoly forces have reduced the important of inter-organizational compatibility since then
[19:36:11] <twb> e.g. Intel's C compiler is now built on llvm.
[19:37:27] <huf> I think the real force driving that was the experience of a generation of programmers trying to port stuff between wildly diverging compilers
[19:37:36] <twb> right
[19:37:46] <twb> now there are only like 2½ compilers where there used to be 20
[19:37:59] <huf> that's the force, the visible effects are standards and compilers getting closer to each other
[19:38:02] <huf> and yeah
[19:38:04] <huf> happened to the web
[19:38:09] <twb> That's what I meant about monopolization
[19:38:10] <huf> now there's like 2 browsers
[19:38:24] <twb> Yeah there's only two browser engines – gecko and blink
[19:38:33] <huf> we hated what ie6 did, we cared about standards, now we have just 2 browsers
[19:38:42] <twb> and gecko exists because google pays for it, so that EU anti-trust rules don't kick in
[19:38:44] <huf> so we're moving into an ie6 era but worse
[19:38:54] <twb> the same way Microsoft used to keep Apple around
[19:39:22] <twb> in the ie6 era, the browser engine authors were directly writing the stndards, either
[19:39:25] <twb> Now, they are.
[19:39:26] <huf> hell, unix did the same thing
[19:39:30] <twb> w3 was replaced outright by whatwg

[19:39:37] <huf> then they tried being more standard

[23:20:00] <nomagno> twb: "A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2" is a popular language level of assessment that seems to have been coined by Cambridge, although it is used for the "Common European Framework of Reference for Languages". It can be roughly interpreted as: A1 - Basic understanding of the language. A2 - Can understand commonly used sentences and expresaions in the language. B1 - Can understand main points of complex discussions and hold conversations in the language. B2 -
[23:20:00] <nomagno> Can independently work and live in a native country. C1 - Can adequately operate in a professional/formal environment in the language. C2 - More-than-native, academic understanding of the language. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages
[23:22:45] <twb> thanks
[23:24:53] <nomagno> I was supposed to take a B2 exam almost two years ago now, but the oh-so-great pandemic has significantly delayed this stuff
[23:25:30] <nomagno> I am also not taking a test until the relevant institution gives me a refund.
