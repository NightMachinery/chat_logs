[20:37:40] <artchad> Good evening. I'm currently playing around with SDL2. I loaded the examples and pressed escape while the test with the red triangle was running. This is the output of the inferior lisp process started by emacs.

[20:37:59] <artchad> A segfault is weird for just exiting the game. ;D

[20:38:32] <artchad> ^printed things
[20:40:57] <edgar-rft> new game: Beware of SegFault!
[20:40:58] <artchad> everything including the warning about "redefining THREAD-FOR-EVALUATION [...]" is from just starting the lisp via slime.
[20:41:35] <artchad> edgar-rft: You can never leave it. If you leave, you segfault in the meta game and loose. "exit this game without a segfault."
[20:42:32] <edgar-rft> stupidly I have no idea with your SDL problem :-(
[20:43:14] <artchad> I'm on OpenBSD btw.
[20:43:57] <artchad> Maybe it's because I use a Software compatibility layer for OpenGL, because my Nvidia graphics card doesn't work on openbsd?
[20:44:10] <artchad> The window is software rendered and not GPU accelerated.
[20:45:01] <mfiano> That might indeed be a problem. I can confirm cl-sdl2 amd nvidia driver works fine on FreeBSD, so if that is an option for you.

[20:46:00] <artchad> It's not the end of the world. I can still run the programs.
[20:46:15] <artchad> Is there a way to interact with the lisp image from another REPL while the game is running?
[20:46:33] <mfiano> Run it in another thread.
[20:46:50] <artchad> Alright, I'll learn how to do that.
[20:46:50] *** Quits: gxt (~gxt@gateway/tor-sasl/gxt) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:47:06] <artchad> I currently have not yet manually  worked with threads.
[20:47:13] <mfiano> Sly, a better SLIME alternative, has builtin support for running event loops that don't block the REPL.
[20:47:18] *** Joins: gxt (~gxt@gateway/tor-sasl/gxt)
[20:47:22] <artchad> Is there some quickstart guide for that?
[20:47:32] <mfiano> Not aware of one
[20:47:41] <artchad> I'll figure it out
[20:47:53] <artchad> Sly was slow for me the last time I used it.
[20:47:55] <artchad> :/
[20:48:57] <artchad> Ok, now I know what to do. "Learn how to use threads in common lisp. Then write a game, while never exiting it."
[20:49:18] <artchad> That would be actually good practice. It forces you to write stable modular encapsulated code.

[20:51:22] <aeth> the problem with never exiting is that some things will require a restart
[20:51:42] <aeth> you have to be years (or maybe 4-5 months full time?) into your design to not have to do that
[20:53:13] <artchad> aeth, I was talking about whenever I start working on the game for a set amount of time. With trivial-gamekit I often times had to restart the game, because of the way I developed the game.
[20:54:13] <artchad> It's good practice to develop the game so that only a minimal number of restarts is necessary to test you changes.
[21:13:10] <aeth> or
[21:13:17] <aeth> make it so it starts very quickly
[21:14:16] <aeth> e.g. I went from... 10-20 second start to instant start by switching to static-vectors for assets so it doesn't copy before passing those off to C
[21:14:24] <aeth> at the expense of having to manually free them
[21:14:49] <aeth> (why copying takes so long, idk... maybe type checking was also done)
[21:15:36] <artchad> the thing is that the whole lisp image crashes when I exit. So I would have to write some emacs-lisp function which starts slime, loads the game and starts the game.
[21:16:46] <aeth> I don't crash (probably some foreign memory issue where you double free or don't free before restarting the foreign library)... but, personally, when I restart I almost always also restart slime, too, to make sure it's a clean start
[21:17:06] <aeth> otherwise, I might be testing an intermediate state that doesn't actually exist on disk anywhere (e.g. if I recompiled one file or function, but not all of them)
[21:18:03] <artchad> Yeah, I had that issue once. 
[21:18:18] <artchad> It can become frustrating if you overlook something like that.
[21:19:27] <artchad> I'm really wondering how I would go about resolving this crashing issue. Like, OpenGL is just a spec for a C API. I'm not sure what's going wrong. The OpenBSD guys usually write very robust code.
[21:21:33] <artchad> I have an sbcl.core file from the crash. It also happens with vanilla sbcl. (No slime)
[21:22:16] <artchad> http://paste.debian.net/plain/1225708
[21:22:50] <artchad> That's the output I got now after testing it in a basic terminal within "rlwrap sbcl".
[21:25:17] <artchad> I'm just sharing it, because why not.
