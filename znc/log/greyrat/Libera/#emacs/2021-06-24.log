[04:45:26] <dale> with-output-to-temp-buffer is kind of weird, it wants a buffer name and implies that the buffer might already exist.  It explicitly does not accept a buffer object.  It erases the buffer contents.
[04:46:12] <pjb> You may want to output to multiple buffers at the same time. 
[04:46:17] <dale> I assume that it was either written before some of the modern Elisp customs arose, or else it serves a particular purpose I haven't thought of, perhaps WRT performance.
[04:46:24] <pjb> also you can just (prin1 foo some-buffer)

[05:02:02] <dale> And actually, a weak reference to a marker doesn't really matter, right?  Emacs always has a reference to every buffer, doesn't it?  And even if there is a reference to a buffer in some variable, if the buffer is killed, the reference to the buffer is now a reference to a deleted buffer, eh?
[05:02:13] <pjb> right.
[05:02:17] <grym> rdrg109: grepping logs for your nick plus TIL is always worth rereading occasionally; do keep it up!

[10:10:06] <danrobi70> d*
[10:10:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> danrobi70: It's not too bad, but when you leave it open for days it doesn't reduce in memory usage, even if you kill almost all buffers. That's because of some glibc-specific internals on memory management.
[10:10:44] <danrobi70> I mean I have so many buffer open. Anything else probly would uses double as memory
[10:11:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's some default gotchas that aren't great like mp4 files getting opened directly as binary buffers. :/
[10:11:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's due to a missing file handler association imo and it'll probably get fixed upstream at some point.
[10:11:31] <danrobi70> ya saw that. scray shit

[14:05:07] <coat> curious if most people use ERC? or the majority uses other things?
[14:05:22] <bremner> one of those two is definitely true

[14:07:01] <danrobi70> I find ERC much more 'user-friendly'

[14:07:36] <Viking667> I don't know if I find it more "user-friendly", more that it's more powerful because of the emacs infrastructure.
[14:08:01] <edgar-rft> I think I can copy-paste from *scratch* with *any* irc client :-)
[14:08:26] <Viking667> I mean, yes I could certainly have written python scripts to extend irssi, but come on, who wants to leave their IRC client just to snarf text to paste back in?
[14:08:36] <Viking667> This way I get the best of both worlds.
[14:08:44] <kilobug> I'm still using irssi, IRC is one of the few things for which I didn't switch to emacs (yet?)
[14:08:45] <Viking667> and irssi's no editor, let's face it.
[14:09:08] <ngz> Circe is an interesting alternative, too.
[14:09:22] <Viking667> Yeah, irssi's not bad. I had the first twenty Alt-num and Alt-Shift-num set to channels.

[14:15:47] <susam> I still use irssi. But I am not what you would call an Emacs power user. My intro to Emacs was via SLIME when I began learning Common Lisp. I eventually left Vim after 18 years and switched to Emacs full time for editing and programming but that's the extent of my fulltime Emacs usage: programming and editing.

[14:20:09] <madnificent> edgar-rft: i run znc on a server now and use znc-erc.  that helps.
[14:20:18] <theseus> coat: It needs a signald server running but after that it can run through pidgin. I reckon it would be easy to display that in emacs as well, maybe someone already made that, not sure 
[14:21:27] <coat> edgar-rft: how is znc-erc different from erc? ERC does not care whether it connects to the IRC network or the bouncer, does it?
[14:22:08] <kakuhen> I got into Emacs because one of my friends talked about it a lot, and when I got my macbook, I decided to get him to guide me so that I can typeset math papers with it.

[14:22:57] <madnificent> coat: znc is a background service that keeps a connection with IRC.  you can connect to that instead of IRC directly and it keeps you logged in.
[14:23:28] <coat> madnificent: I know about znc. My question is what is this znc-erc package (is it?) and how is it different from erc package?
[14:23:39] <coat> madnificent: Or did you mean ZNC + ERC when you wrote znc-erc?
[14:23:40] <edgar-rft> kakuhen: true, emacs is awkward first, until you discover that you can tweak nearly everything how *you* like it :-)
[14:23:46] <madnificent> coat: it allows you to connect to znc using erc
[14:23:53] <kakuhen> well, it took me a looong time before I got to learning elisp

[14:24:39] <kakuhen> edgar-rft: I knew at most setq and use-package for my first 3 months of usage or so, and then I got interested in Lisp, but I stayed undecided between learning common lisp first or emacs lisp first
[14:24:50] <pkal> coat: yes
[14:24:51] <kakuhen> went with emacs lisp first due to the intro to emacs lisp bundled with the editor
[14:24:57] <kakuhen> and now i use common lisp too
[14:25:32] <coat> kakuhen: what do you write most of your tools in? CL or EL? What other programming languages do you write your tools in?
[14:26:01] <kakuhen> well, i didnt do any programming at all until I picked up an objective-c book that a friend recommended me last november or so.
[14:26:15] <kakuhen> and as a result i have tiny softwares written in objective-c, and some stuff in elisp
[14:26:18] <theseus> Cool, I always felt a little intimidated by CL, I know a bit of scheme, though 
[14:26:21] <susam> My journey is opposite. I came to Emacs due to Common Lisp. So learnt Common Lisp first. Still don't know much of Emacs Lisp.
[14:26:30] <kakuhen> i'm actually working on a thing in elisp right now to make my emacs respond to changes in dark/light mode
[14:26:36] <madnificent> coat: from my perspective, i will not write more in cl than in some other languages, but cl is a game-changer.
[14:27:09] <madnificent> coat: znc provides helper functions.  nothing amazing or impossible, just handy.
[14:27:20] <tyson2> madnificent: why does cl have that nature?
[14:27:35] <coat> madnificent: can you elaboare it further? did not understand this part - "i will not write more in cl than in some other languages" - you mean use all languages equally but you acknowledge that CL is a game changer?
[14:27:41] <twb> tyson2: it has OO
[14:27:46] <tyson2> (currently starting with cl - PCL)
[14:28:09] <susam> tyson2: Where are you at in PCL? Which chapter or page?
[14:28:32] <tyson2> susam: right at the beginning.  Trying to budget time for study now
[14:28:44] <tyson2> but I am reading some of the practical examples
[14:29:03] <susam> tyson2: We have a book club at #offbeat where we have been talking about starting a PCL reading club for quite sometime. We haven't started it yet. We are working through a mathematics book at this time but PCL book club is on the cards.
[14:29:04] <Viking667> coat: znc has a couple of issues with ERC if you connect to multiple servers with the same channel name, if I remember correctly.
[14:29:09] <madnificent> tyson2: it has a bunch of features that are hard to find in other languages.  the language has many base constructs that are more expressive than what others offer (examples: the condition system, access to the reader, special variables) and the formal definition allows you to code against a solid foundation rather than the swamp that is the current status quo.
[14:29:10] <tyson2> I have experience with Scheme and a little elisp
[14:29:46] <tyson2> susam: would be interested in joining the club.  Will note the channel
[14:30:01] <madnificent> coat: regarding the statement; i write more javascript because browsers exist and because cl is not well-known.  any project i pick up in cl, i'll have to maintain myself and there's limited time available.
[14:30:06] <tyson2> madnificent: that jibes with my impression
[14:30:27] <Viking667> As for me, I haven't really "learned" lisp of any kind yet.
[14:30:27] <madnificent> though in reality, people can read cl code once you explain the paren goes at the start.
[14:30:35] <Viking667> <grin>
[14:30:38] <susam> tyson2: I am at Chapter 3 at this time. I write a my personal tools in CL but never learnt it from a proper book yet. I just use the CLHS to look things up. That is why I want to read PCL completely once.
[14:30:53] <tyson2> for web, I am only interested in intelligent prototypes, don't want to write js if it can be avoided
[14:31:09] <Viking667> "PCL" == Practical Common Lisp?
[14:31:28] <madnificent> i'm happy with our setup.  we have a stack with multiple languages in it so it allows us to experiment with what makes sense.

[17:48:28] <davidkrauser> felixp: do you use the same instance of emacs to run erc that you use for other things? I'd like to use emacs for IRC, but I find that I'm regularly kill/restart emacs
[17:48:58] <davidkrauser> Maybe I need an Emacs instance that is IRC only? But that doesn't feel as useful as having everything in one place
[17:49:37] <TheFreim> davidkrauser: emacs-daemon maybe a solution? 
[17:49:41] <danrobi70> wasamasa: if I have 4 buffers open. 1 up/left another up/right etc. Then in 1 buffer I run "C-x 1" can I go back to my previous 4 buffers layout with same buffers with eyebrowse ? Is this what eyebrowse is for ? 
[17:49:53] <bremner> davidkrauser: I use a bouncer, so restarting emacs is not a big deal
[17:49:57] <wgreenhouse> davidkrauser: some people use a bouncer; others (cc technomancy and offby1) have an always-on emacs -nw for irc purposes, similar to the way some people host a weechat or irssi
[17:50:18] <wasamasa> danrobi70: you could do that alone with winner-mode
[17:50:25] <danrobi70> ah
[17:50:38] <davidkrauser> TheFreim: I do use the daemon, but I kill that frequently. Usually when lsp and dap-mode get wonky

[17:51:31] <fsbot> Of course not!
[17:51:32] <davidkrauser> bremner and wgreenhouse: I could use a bouncer. That's probably the better approach.

[17:52:42] <davidkrauser> TheFreim: it isn't a troubled process - the actual elisp code gets in a weird state sometimes. I don't understand it well enough to fix it without a full restart
[17:53:12] <davidkrauser> TheFreim: and dap-mode (for golang at least) calls the VSCode JS extension with node, and that just adds more complexity :-/

[20:20:25] <pjb> Even learning scheme can help your lisp-foo  when programming elisp or cl.
[20:20:47] <johnjay> pkal: the reason i make the argument is that the elisp manual is very detailed and actually a good thing.
[20:21:01] <pjb> indeed.
[20:21:02] <johnjay> so i'm imagining reading the whole thing and then i guess you'd learn CL and say oh NOW I get it
[20:21:09] <pkal> spowmtom: Aha, I get what you mean. That can be confusing, and certainly becomes an issue when macros are too complicated

[20:21:33] <fsbot> (do ((VAR INIT [STEP])...) (END-TEST [RESULT...]) BODY...)
[20:21:33] <fsbot> The Common Lisp ‘do’ loop.
[20:21:42] <pjb> this is explained in the documentation.
[20:21:44] <pkal> johnjay: That would require someone with a better attention span than me ^^
[20:21:50] <dale> johnjay: OTOH there are a lot of books and other resources for learning Common Lisp.
[20:21:56] <pjb> Also, note how a lot of stuff in emacs lisp comes from Common Lisp.
[20:22:15] <spowmtom> My personal favorite books to learn CL is Practical Common Lisp and ANSI Common Lisp
[20:22:23] <spowmtom> are*
[20:22:40] <pkal> My favorite was PAIP, even if the focus isn't CL itself
[20:22:43] <pjb> http://cliki.net/Online+Tutorial  https://cliki.net/Lisp%20books
[20:23:04] <pjb> pkal: well, PAIP still contains a whole section with a small CL reference…
[20:23:37] <johnjay> pjb: yes this ist he most compelling argument I think
[20:23:42] <pjb> PAIP is interesting because it rewrites in CL old and important AI algorithms developped in varions historical LISPs.
[20:23:43] <johnjay> a lot of emacs lisp is clearly cl influenced
[20:24:32] <pkal> The most interesting thing about Elisp is that it continues to "live on

[23:53:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It unfortunately mangles gifs in display so they stay a single image... but for most epubs that isn't an issue.

[23:58:15] <andreyorst> can someone explain my why `file-expand-wildcards' fires up tramp?
[23:58:47] *** Joins: hjst (~hjst@fedora/hjst)
[23:59:07] <andreyorst> there's a comment after this function ;; Let Tramp know that `file-expand-wildcards' does not need an advice.
[23:59:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unverified preliminary guess: It might simply be loading all known file-handlers
[23:59:12] <andreyorst> but I can't make much sense of it
