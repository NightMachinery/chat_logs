[11:51:53] <eggbean> I'm using Pop!_OS (Ubuntu-based), so my installation options are not very good. The Flatpak does not use my config files which I want to maintain in a dotfiles git repository, but the virtualenv method does give a launcher shortcut and it's not easily installed using ansible. The repository version does not have these problems but it's old.
[11:53:29] <eggbean> I could take the time to get it installed using ansible, if I can get it to also add a launcher shortcut.
[11:54:04] <ktprograms> eggbean: Manually create a qutebrowser.desktop file and save it to the correct location with ansible?
[11:54:55] <eggbean> ktprograms: I have tried to make a shortcut for gnome, but it didn't work.
[11:55:15] <eggbean> I'll see if I can find it. One sec..
[11:55:24] <ktprograms> eggbean: Not a shortcut, a Desktop Entry: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries
[11:55:51] <eggbean> Yeah, that is what I meant
[11:56:35] <ktprograms> eggbean: Where did you save the entry?
[11:57:21] <eggbean> ~/.local/share/applications
[11:57:31] <eggbean> This is it: http://sprunge.us/Ft93e7
[11:57:58] <ktprograms> Did you run `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications`? (See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries#Update_database_of_desktop_entries)
[11:58:28] <eggbean> No, I don't think I did
[11:58:49] <ktprograms> Try that and see if it works?
[11:59:28] <eggbean> Yeah, okay. I will have to uninstall the repository version first
[12:01:45] <eggbean> I have tabs open that I don't want to lose, so I'll try it a bit later. 
[12:01:55] <ktprograms> eggbean: Ok sure
[12:01:59] <eggbean> An AppImage version would be ideal
[12:02:58] <The-Compiler> eggbean: I'd rather not have to maintain yet another flavor of Linux packaging, but I won't say no if someone maintains it
[12:03:39] <The-Compiler> eggbean: but yeah, creating a .desktop file for a virtualenv install based on https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/misc/org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.desktop should be straightforward
[12:04:08] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: Where would the .desktop file be placed if installing in a venv?
[12:04:13] <eggbean> Yeah, I looked at a guide to making AppImages, and it used a Qt-based program as the example. It didn't look too difficult, but I thought it would end up taking a lot of time for me as I would have to learn the whole process
[12:04:34] <eggbean> The-Compiler: thanks
[12:04:53] <The-Compiler> ktprograms: ~/.local/share/applications probably
[12:05:15] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: I thought a venv can't touch things outside the venv?
[12:05:34] <The-Compiler> ktprograms: what do you maen with "a venv can't touch"?
[12:05:38] <The-Compiler> mean*
[12:06:13] <ktprograms> Can a program in a venv modify files outside the venv folder?
[12:07:48] <The-Compiler> ktprograms: sure (otherwise, how would qutebrowser, say, download files to your home folder?). It's just a Python install in a subfolder, not any kind of sandboxing.
[12:08:08] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: Ah I see. Haven't used the venv version of qutebrowser before.
[12:09:00] <The-Compiler> all that a virtualenv does is change your $PATH to a python install (or symlink) in the virtualenv folder, and that Python then imports its libraries and such from that folder rather than from the system

[15:06:29] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: FWIW I don't even see what's supposed to hide the navbar arrows in the CSS, but anyways, it works with Qt 6 (based on a newer Chromium) (This message has been postponed on 2022-01-24 09:14:21.)
[15:07:53] <Voidwarper> Is there a way to enable hardware acceleration in qutebrowser? (latest version)
[15:08:44] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: for video rendering? No, but you can use mpv to play them usually.
[15:08:53] <Voidwarper> my issue is that when i scroll pages with qutebrowser there is a noticable lag (its not a smooth experience by any means) but when i do the same in google chrome its smooth
[15:08:59] <Voidwarper> can't figure what the issue is
[15:09:21] <The-Compiler> how do you scroll? What version of qutebrowser?
[15:10:51] <Voidwarper> The-Compiler: https://paste.the-compiler.org/view/02df532a
[15:11:02] <Voidwarper> i scroll with arrow keys or jk
[15:14:05] <Voidwarper> i tested the same webpage with chrome and qute
[15:14:29] <Voidwarper> scrolling both with up and down arrow keys, qutebrowser seems to stutter a lot
[15:14:46] <Voidwarper> very unsmooth scrolling for some reason
[15:19:27] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: if you're holding those keys, that's probably just qutebrowser reacting to OS key repetition
[15:25:11] <Voidwarper> The-Compiler: yes i am holding them down
[15:25:23] <Voidwarper> how else can i scroll with keys
[15:26:14] <Voidwarper> This behavior is weird for a keyboard driven browser
[15:26:53] <Voidwarper> it should work like onKeyDown, onKeyUp
[15:27:00] <Voidwarper> not like jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
[15:30:32] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: that requires either hardcoded keybindings (which won't happen) or a way to bind separate commands to keydown/-up (which doesn't exjst yet, but there is an issue open about it)
[15:31:40] <Voidwarper> maybe i need this: :set scrolling.smooth ?
[15:32:00] <Voidwarper> i need to see what my set options are to see if its on
[15:32:57] <Voidwarper> in config.py: # c.scrolling.smooth = False
[15:33:32] <Voidwarper> its commented out and set to false, maybe this will help me. not sure why it isn't enabled by default

[15:38:41] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: qutebrowser does not use nodejs
[15:39:08] <Voidwarper> nodejs got pulled as a dependency of qutebrowser system wide, but i also use a local binary (in my home folder) which i have exported to PATH for development etc
[15:39:47] <Voidwarper> gentoo tells me, qtwebengine depends on nodejs

[16:08:57] <nimaje> not sure what gentoo does, nodejs seems to be an optional buildtime dependency ("On all platforms, the following tools are required at build time: â€¦ - Node.js for a full featured Dev Tools.")
[16:10:51] <ionen> qtwebengine doesn't depend on nodejs on Gentoo
[16:11:09] <ionen> firefox does fwiw
[16:11:27] <ionen> (build time)
[16:12:10] <nimaje> I guess BDEPEND means buildtime dependency, so it seems correct there https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-qt/qtwebengine/dependencies
[16:12:26] <ionen> yeah was about to correct myself, I missed the bdepend
[16:13:04] <ionen> similar deal then
[16:14:48] <ionen> (these can be removed after building, or skipped if using a prebuilt qtwebengine, fwiw we do have a binpkg at https://gentoo.osuosl.org/experimental/amd64/binpkg/default/linux/17.1/x86-64/dev-qt/qtwebengine/))
[16:15:50] <ionen> I personally build it everytime though, takes a good 2 hours ;p
[16:19:57] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4768 re scrolling and key repetition btw
[16:20:37] <nimaje> according to my logs my last build of qtwebengine on freebsd took ~20 min (ccache ftw (firefox and chromium still take ages for some reason))
[16:21:19] <ionen> yeah I guess I should use ccache for it, it doesn't change that much between bumps
[16:21:42] <ionen> firefox/chromium probably invalidate the cache everytime
[16:21:52] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: judging from https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtwebengine.git/tree/configure.pri?h=5.15.8#n184 there doesn't seem to be a way to override nodejs for QtWebEngine specificially
