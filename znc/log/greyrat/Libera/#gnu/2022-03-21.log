[06:01:30] <Nios34> I just find that kinda software in Parabola GNU/Linux :P
[06:01:48] <jxself> It's common for programs to communicate over the internet.
[06:02:08] <jxself> Your description, for example, could cover an XMPP client or a web browser.
[06:02:18] <jxself> HTTP, for example, could be thought of as an "API."
[06:02:23] <Nios34> Connect to something like Google Docs
[06:02:46] <jxself> Web browsers "allow" connecting to Google Docs. Ban web browsers?
[06:03:16] <Nios34> So a telegram client will be accepted?
[06:03:19] <jxself> It might be helpful if you could point concretely to what the program is what you found.

[06:04:37] <jxself> How is that connected to Parabola?

[06:06:22] <jxself> There! :)

[06:06:32] <Nios34> I don't think a free/libre operating system should include something like telegram client.
[06:06:52] <jxself> Let's be clear; Are we talking of Telegram or this ydcv program?
[06:07:36] <Nios34> ydcv
[06:07:55] <Nios34> But I think they're doing the something
[06:08:03] <jxself> Not really.
[06:08:17] <Nios34> Which is connecting to a proprietry service
[06:09:01] <jxself> It becomes difficult to generalize this though.
[06:09:31] <jxself> Using a web browser, are you to avoid websites that use Microsoft's proprietary IIS web server?
[06:10:06] <jxself> Do you even check what the web server is? So you may be connecting to a proprietary thing already without realizing?
[06:10:19] <jxself> So there is a difference to be drawn.
[06:10:55] <Nios34> > Using a web browser, are you to avoid websites that use Microsoft's proprietary IIS web server? > Because the user wish to connect it?
[06:11:00] <jxself> Merely visiting a web site powered by IIS doesn't require you to install or run nonfree software in and of itself.
[06:11:34] <jxself> The same with an email server. Your POP3/IMAP could be free or proprietary. It can be hard to know what they run on the server side.
[06:12:21] <Nios34> Because I've accepted the probability to connect a proprietry service.

[06:12:52] <jxself> Even if not, what software they run on the server doesn't affect you. Check out https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html
[06:13:36] <jxself> ydcv seems undesirable as it looks to be SaaSS.
[06:14:23] <jxself> Let's see what the GNU FSDG say on it... Checking out https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html
[06:15:41] <jxself> Hmmm. It doesn't seem to speak of SaaSS.
[06:16:31] <jxself> My thought is that it's undesirable to have included. But since the GNU FSDG don't speak of it the first step seems to be to start a discussion about adding that in to there. :)
[06:16:54] <jxself> Unless it really is in there and I'm just missing it.
[06:17:33] <Nios34> Okay. But what if a free/libre telegram client is installed in the OS, and the telegram server track the user. Is it some kind of malware?
[06:19:20] <jxself> We can imagine that the Telegram server software is actually free though. Because the company Telegram FZ LLC wrote it, and we can imagine that the have the source code and the rights to change it and to share it if they desire.
[06:19:27] <jxself> Right?
[06:19:35] <jxself> Or at least, free for them. :)
[06:19:47] <jxself> If you see what I mean.

[17:44:21] <str0> how much shorter would it be
[17:44:41] <jemarch> define "a program"
[17:44:44] <jemarch> should it be portable?
[17:44:51] <jemarch> should it build with any compiler?
[17:45:26] <jemarch> a quick and dirty program that lists files in a given directory in _your_ system probably would take around 10 lines of code
[17:45:27] <str0> Written in C and compatable with unix like systems
[17:45:34] <kilobug> str0: much shorter, but GNU ls does a lot, various listing, sorting, recursion, columned display, colors, human-readable sizes, ...

[17:50:03] <ln> besides, in many real-life programs a huge portion of the code is about handling all kinds of errors.
[17:50:45] <str0> Interesting
[17:51:21] <jemarch> str0: that was an excellent and pertinent question though
[17:52:24] <ln> DIR *d = opendir("."); while (readdir(...)) puts(entry); closedir(d);  <-- something like that could be a very trivial implementation of 'ls', but if you add proper error handling for each call, the number of lines is easily tripled or quadrupled.
[17:54:09] <str0> There is also some stuff, I noticed, that is exclusively meant to work with other gnu utils. For example --dired

[19:04:41] <jxself> The README talks of the history of Freedo and Freedo was made by other people. Multiple people have been involved.
[19:04:46] <jxself> It's a good read.
[19:04:57] <jxself> So one reason is the advice from https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html that "When you contribute to an existing project, you should usually release your modified versions under the same license as the original work."
[19:05:31] <jxself> The other reason is that, given the information in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_protection_for_fictional_characters even if I wanted to disregard the first advice, it seems safest to follow the same licensing as the original.
