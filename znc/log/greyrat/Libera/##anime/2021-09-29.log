[00:12:46] <Cryowolf> I want a decentralized network behind all the PC platforms (Steam, Epic, GoG etc) where your ownership is registered and which platform you decide to open the game on, doesn't matter. You can use the onw you prefer and even buy it on another one if it's cheaper there
[00:13:04] *** Joins: mokura (~mokura@cpe90-146-60-18.liwest.at)
[00:13:29] <Bco1981> GoG ?? don't they have drm free stuff ?
[00:14:03] <Cryowolf> yes
[00:14:45] <Bco1981> oh, you still use some launcher thing for them anyway ?
[00:14:53] <Bco1981> not just run the game ?
[00:16:26] <brainwash> you want the chinese system?
[00:16:50] <brainwash> one system that controls everything that you do
[00:19:30] <Vohveli> you can play GoG games through their launcher or download a standalone installer
[00:20:40] <brainwash> but launcher is needed for certain features, no?
[00:21:43] <brainwash> like online multiplayer

[00:23:38] <Cryowolf> brainwash, yes but decentralized just means I own it everywhere
[00:23:42] <Cryowolf> not just on one platform
[00:23:53] <Cryowolf> like the digital version of a hard copy
[00:24:04] <Cryowolf> then I can choose platform based on features
[00:24:12] <brainwash> would you be willing to pay extra for that?
[00:24:15] <Cryowolf> and buy it based on price
[00:24:56] <Cryowolf> I don't think there would be much extra cost to it, they've started doing that for social media and will probably do it for youtube etc too because it takes away some legal responsibility
[00:25:01] <Cryowolf> so it's an incentive for some
[00:25:42] <brainwash> and xbox vs playstation?
[00:25:50] <Cryowolf> but each platform can block any game they want from being played there. But that doesn't mean someone out there can't open source code a platform that just launches the games
[00:26:09] <brainwash> you buy an xbox game, but want to be able to dl for free on playstation too?

[00:26:18] <Cryowolf> different hardware etc
[00:26:24] <Cryowolf> that's not gonna be decentralized
[00:26:33] <brainwash> why not?
[00:26:57] <Cryowolf> because neither has an incentive to do that. Often it's exclusives that will tip the scale on which console is purchased
[00:27:17] <Cryowolf> and because they have different hardware etc
[00:27:28] <Cryowolf> games coded on playstation won't really work immediately on xbox
[00:27:38] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:27:44] <brainwash> I meant multi platform games
[00:27:47] <brainwash> obviously
[00:27:52] <Cryowolf> but on PCs theyre coded for PC, the platform is just irritatingly in the way
[00:28:38] <Cryowolf> I think when it comes to multiplatform games they cant decentralize it since the code is different for the different versions, so in this case it's up to the publisher if they want to offer both versions in one
[00:29:42] <Cryowolf> still there might be a way but I dunno if publishers would agree when it comes to different consoles
[00:29:53] <brainwash> maybe Amazon could buy all these stores and unite them
[00:30:05] <Cryowolf> on the PC it's different since it might increase sales when people can buy on one and add it to their favorite platform
[00:30:28] <Cryowolf> instead of skipping a purchase cause they dont like the platform it's exclusive on
[00:31:09] <brainwash> exclusivity is needed though
[00:31:38] <brainwash> look at nintendo
[00:31:41] <Cryowolf> thats what would be the motivating factor on PC. For players the motivating factor would be that they know own the game and have a digital "crypto" of it that's not going away even if you lose access to your platform account.
[00:31:56] <Cryowolf> now*
[00:32:05] <brainwash> "own"
[00:32:30] <brainwash> those companies don't want you to own games anymore
[00:32:41] <brainwash> in a physical way
[00:32:47] <Cryowolf> it's different from hard copies, but they're going away whether we like it or not
[00:33:03] <Cryowolf> getting another way to get as close to that as possible, in a digital way, would be good
[00:33:29] <KatrinValerie> Just be content with indie games and free software
[00:33:40] <KatrinValerie> That's how you avoid DRM alltogether
[00:33:57] <brainwash> so, what happens if your "global" account is flagged for cheating or abuse?
[00:34:08] <brainwash> everything will be gone?
[00:34:12] <brainwash> yikes
[00:34:19] <KatrinValerie> Battle for Wesnoth is an amazing turn based strategy and it's free open source
[00:34:36] <Cryowolf> brainwash, it can't be
[00:35:13] <Cryowolf> the decentralied network is neutral, it has your ownership registered and confirmed and that's it. A platform can flag you for cheating, but that doesn't flag the network
[00:35:33] <KatrinValerie> lol it's on steam
[00:35:35] <KatrinValerie> https://store.steampowered.com/app/599390/Battle_for_Wesnoth/
[00:35:36] <ImoutoBot> [title] Battle for Wesnoth on Steam
[00:36:11] <KatrinValerie> It's an increadibly lovely game, you can see how much effort and creativetiy was poured into this when you play the campeigns.
[00:36:25] <Cryowolf> This could also enable downloading somewhat drm free versions of the game that only need to be confirmed once on your computer with the network to unlock it
[00:36:30] <Cryowolf> then you can play it whenever
[00:36:47] <brainwash> I prefer 0 A.D.
[00:37:01] <Cryowolf> whats that?
[00:37:12] <KatrinValerie> brainwash: I am too slow for RTS

[00:37:22] <ImoutoBot> [title] 0 A.D. | A free, open-source game of ancient warfare
[00:38:34] <Cryowolf> I hope they make a decentralized network, that way even open source platforms could let you library and download games and updates. Of course the service of games and updates would be up to the platform owner. The network doesn't have your game there, but it has you confirmed as its owner
[00:38:36] <psyomn> haha oh man, I remember 0 ad!
[00:38:47] <Cryowolf> compare it to a bitcoin wallet
[00:39:00] <psyomn> any one ever played / remember warzone 2100, in the same ethos?
[00:40:27] <Cryowolf> Im gonna check out "Outward" before I start up Tales of Arise (finally)
[00:40:29] <KatrinValerie> I am a pleb and only played WC3 custom maps and a little bit of SC2, idk if Anno counts as RTS too, also played The Settlers
[00:41:02] <Cryowolf> first RTS I played was Starcraft
[00:41:05] <Cryowolf> and WC3
[00:41:15] <Cryowolf> and KKND2
[00:41:17] <brainwash> and played age of empires
[00:41:24] <Cryowolf> I loved KKND2
[00:41:59] <Cryowolf> but now I prefer games where I can win through political scheming, trades and so on
[00:42:03] <Cryowolf> rather than fighting
[00:42:09] <Cryowolf> but if I h ave to fight, I like it to be turn based
[00:44:26] <KatrinValerie> In Anno you must utilise both politics and also military to win a Game.
[00:44:40] <KatrinValerie> You can utilise the economy as well
[00:45:01] <KatrinValerie> Make someone dependent on goods you trade and cut them off to cause havoc
[00:45:02] <Nanobot> This table has a column called "PermanentID", and another column called "OldPermanentID"...
[00:45:20] <KatrinValerie> I like doing evil things in video games for some reason.
[00:45:39] <KatrinValerie> Anyone else here burned their sims to death in windowless rooms?
[00:46:02] <KatrinValerie> Nanobot: looks like that id was not so permanent after all.
[00:47:25] <Cryowolf> If a strategy game is to have combat, I really like it when it's turn based tactical. Like a more advanced version of HoMM3
[00:48:04] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, no but I put a microwave next to the bathtub and make sure they're clumsy
[00:48:37] <KatrinValerie> Wesnoth is entirely turn based, but it's rather focused on combat.
[00:49:43] <Cryowolf> turn based in the tactical sense or just two groups on a map doing stuff?
[00:50:12] <Nanobot> KatrinValerie: Also, neither of these are mentioned in the documentation, even though a bunch of schools seem to use them as their primary student IDs.
[00:50:34] <Cryowolf> it looks like a Heroes of Might and Magic clone
[00:50:54] <Cryowolf> then I might as well play the HoMM3 remastered

[10:31:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: lol
[10:31:07] <DunceCotus> such a random tradition 
[10:31:44] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it was created by KFC of course
[10:32:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: valentine's Day and white day were pushed by chocolate making companies
[10:34:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: Coca-Cola invented the modern western Christmas iconography

[10:35:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: before it was green.. the green man
[10:35:40] <DunceCotus> stripped Christmas of its pagan roots
[10:35:41] <amigojapan> Yeah I know DunceCotus , it's totally a consumerism holiday
[10:36:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: nowadays a kid seeing a green Santa would think.. that's wrong
[10:36:25] <DunceCotus> Santa's suit is red
[10:36:30] <DunceCotus> and it feels right that its red
[10:36:43] <DunceCotus> but feelings are always being manipulated
[10:37:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they did not entirely erase the green of christmas
[10:37:31] <DunceCotus> it was just combined with the red
[10:37:51] <DunceCotus> I have a feeling barber iconography was grafted to the holiday
[10:38:04] <DunceCotus> candy canes resembling barber poles
[10:38:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the deep dive on this topic becomes profound in its ontological implications
[10:39:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: eating blood?
[10:39:12] <DunceCotus> blood of Christ[mas]
[10:40:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: with Christ all the pagan Gods were killed off
[10:40:48] <DunceCotus> and their corpses now serve as the Body without Organs for modern capitalist society
[10:41:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: new ones were born, like Guadalupe
[10:41:29] <amigojapan> Catholic approved
[10:41:49] <DunceCotus> there isn't really a God in Christianity.. its a trinitarian, oedipal triangulation of nihilism 
[10:42:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this is why Nietzsche said God is dead
[10:43:02] <DunceCotus> first there was the alchemic combination of all Gods into God
[10:43:26] <DunceCotus> once this was completed the combined God was seen to have been Earth all along
[10:43:37] <amigojapan> Nietzsche was actually sad God was dead
[10:44:17] <DunceCotus> he was sad in that it meant the reign of a bad nihilism
[10:44:34] <DunceCotus> however he was sure humanity in its current state was more of a transitionary phase to 'ubermensch'
[10:44:51] <DunceCotus> Godpeople
[10:45:55] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: humans are phase in a broader life cycle
[10:46:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: however the way life works is that all phases of a life cycle are present simultaneously in the same milieu
[10:46:36] <DunceCotus> we still have fish, 'lower' mammals etc. -- our genetic ancestry
[10:46:49] <DunceCotus> and therefore the ubermensch is here now too.. but where?
[10:47:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this is what I think we call 'aliens'

[10:52:12] <DunceCotus> well in a way I think that's correct

[16:00:34] <unlitwitch> japan has a weird blend of shintoism and buddhism
[16:00:52] <unlitwitch> so why should he not know about it?
[16:01:22] <brainwash> does Japan have taoism too?
[16:01:23] <amigojapan> Yeah brainwash the giant buddhas in Japan are thin
[16:01:49] <amigojapan> brainwash: Taoism is from Taiwan I think
[16:03:33] <amigojapan> brainwash: "The three major religious traditions in Taiwan are Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. However, many of the temples in Taiwan reflect a fusion of all three traditions.
[16:04:23] <amigojapan> Ah Taoism is from China
[16:04:57] <unlitwitch> china says taiwan is also china
[16:05:13] <amigojapan> But China does not keep their temples in q good state like Japan and Taiwan
[16:05:20] <brainwash> I would have to spend several hours to learn about all these -ism

[16:05:54] <amigojapan> unlitwitch: I know, and Taiwan says they are the real government of all of China

[16:06:29] <brainwash> Maoism is from China too, or?
[16:06:39] <unlitwitch> maybe they should join the empire of josei-on

[16:07:21] <ImoutoBot> brainwash: Maoism, or Mao Zedong Thought, is a variety of Marxism–Leninism that Mao Zedong developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the Republic of China and later the People's Republic of China.

[16:42:24] <unlitwitch> In our society, witchcraft and spell had been existed for a long time. They had been adapted and developed by Taoists who worship the language and text that can reach Immortals. Over the years, Taoism built up a huge system of spell rituals and ceremonies. 
[16:42:46] <unlitwitch> Taoism believes that language and text not only have the function of the transmission of messages but they are also the symbols of universal energy and this have the power to summon all ghosts and gods though the chi energy and this will help healing people of their evil diseases and becoming immortals.

[18:00:59] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: you'll go to jail if you don't
[18:01:06] <ButterNoodle> thank you
[18:01:22] <amigojapan> Me and my dad call "windscreens" windshields
[18:01:25] <DunceCotus> less humans, less animals, less insects etc.
[18:01:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: oh sorry that's what I meant
[18:01:47] <DunceCotus> I don't drive cars myself
[18:03:01] <DunceCotus> driving in cars with dolls
[18:03:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its an aspect of reality redundancies
[18:03:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you know about the town in Japan populated by hundreds of scare crows?
[18:04:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sounds scary
[18:04:20] <amigojapan> Yeah a bit
[18:05:10] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there's tales of people driving through ghost towns and then when they look on map or google earth etc. the town doesn't exist
[18:05:14] <DunceCotus> or existed years ago etc.
[18:05:18] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the town lost its population and one resident made hundreds of scarecrows to take their place
[18:05:26] <DunceCotus> literal ghost towns
[18:05:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I seee
[18:05:56] <Sadale> amigojapan, what's the point?
[18:06:28] <DunceCotus> I think when driving we can go into a trance, once in a trance we can slip (usually temporarily) into parallel worldlines
[18:06:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: https://youtu.be/vxiOdrVreSQ
[18:06:43] <ImoutoBot> [title] This Japanese Town Replaced Humans With Scarecrows - YouTube
[18:07:32] <amigojapan> Sadale: the scare crows are based on real people that used to live there
[18:07:49] <Sadale> woah
[18:08:04] <Sadale> That's not scare crow. That's scare human!
[18:08:18] <amigojapan> Lol Sadale 
[18:08:19] <Sadale> I'd be creeped out if I stumbled upon that ghost town
[18:08:29] <amigojapan> Yeah
[18:08:37] <DunceCotus> at least that town doesn't have a crow problem
[18:08:54] <amigojapan> Lol DunceCotus 
[18:10:14] <amigojapan> Sadale: 25 real people still live in the town and take care of the dolls and the buildings
[18:10:29] <Sadale> lol
[18:10:37] <Sadale> so that isn't exactly a ghost town
[18:10:45] <amigojapan> Right
[18:11:13] <amigojapan> Sadale: but it used to be over 300 people
[18:13:11] <Sadale> I wonder how life's like in a ghost town
[18:13:33] <amigojapan> Death
[18:13:39] <Bco1981> probably lots of wild animals close
[18:13:45] <Sadale> With declining population you can't really get common stuffs that you need inside the town anymore. So what you're gonna do?
[18:13:56] <Sadale> oh. I mean dying town. Not ghost town
[18:14:07] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[18:16:00] <amigojapan> Sadale: you need to travel a long distance by car to get to this town from Tokyo
[18:16:28] <Sadale> There probably are other town that's more accessible to this dying town than Tokyo
[18:16:40] <amigojapan> Yeah
[18:17:01] <amigojapan> But no train
[18:17:06] <Sadale> :(
[18:19:08] <amigojapan> Sadale: the people that do live there are very old. Even the woman who makes the dolls
[18:19:54] <amigojapan> Sadale: the school gym is in perfect condition
[18:20:03] <Sadale> cool
[18:20:08] <Sadale> but no one's using it :(
[18:20:11] <amigojapan> But no children
[18:20:16] <amigojapan> Right
[18:21:25] <amigojapan> Sadale: you can play basket ball and they have ping pong tables
[18:21:34] <MootPoot> cum
[18:21:43] <Sadale> amigojapan, cool! :3
[18:21:54] <Sadale> amigojapan, funny how you could literally use any infrastructure in any way you want in such a town
[18:21:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, whale
[18:22:09] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I liked it better when people said "anime
[18:22:31] <amigojapan> Yeah Sadale

[18:24:15] <MootPoot> I forgot which op banned him but it was "you cant just show up, say nothing but anime and leave"
[18:24:19] <MootPoot> to which he said anime
[18:24:25] <MootPoot> and then the banhammer whacked
[18:24:33] <amigojapan> Bans don't go from freenode to here tho
[18:24:40] <MootPoot> it was here I think

[18:25:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, That user is still on Libera tho. I've actually contacted him in PM. He isn't as malicious as other ops thought.

[18:26:17] <amigojapan> I hope fenpai is ok beaky 
[18:26:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, anyway there simply isn't enough op to overturn the ban. Sad. :/
[18:26:27] <MootPoot> I wonder what I would do if I got banned from here
[18:26:36] <Sadale> MootPoot, leave libera lololololl

[18:40:23] <Sadale> so. My onahole got delivered. But I don't wanna unpack it because someone else's at home. :/
[18:40:55] <Sadale> I guess I'll wait until a time that my stupid dad isn't around :P
[18:41:05] <TsundereNoises> If you don't have the privacy to unpack it, what are you missing out on? would you really want to use it with them there?
[18:41:31] <Urchin[emacs]> hi TsundereNoises 
[18:41:37] <TsundereNoises> hi Urchin[emacs]
[18:41:58] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, I can use it when my stupid dad isn't around.
[18:42:31] <Sadale> I can't really have privacy in my home tho. I'm sharing a room with my imouto. And she's almost always at home.
[18:42:50] <Sadale> Anyway I'm not trying to hide that from her :P
[18:43:06] <Sadale> I really just can't hide that from her anyway xD
[18:43:31] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: I love that momo/shamiko wedding image btw
[18:43:40] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: yeah, it's nice
[18:44:00] <Sadale> I think Urchin[emacs] should start an anime pic sharing website that updates daily :3
[18:44:00] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: what are you going to do? ask her to go out when you want to use it?
[18:44:04] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: trying to live the anime protagonist life?
[18:44:15] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], When no one else's at home I'd get out of my room and use it.
[18:44:39] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], I just need to make sure that she knows where I store it so that she won't touch that.
[18:46:18] <isekaijin> Sadale: Whoa, you actually bought an onahole and brought it into your parents' home?
[18:46:29] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: nah, his sister doesn't love him enough
[18:46:31] <Sadale> isekaijin, That's because my parent's home is my only home :(

[18:47:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol

[18:48:16] <Sadale> isekaijin, my mom's nice. I'm sure that she's ok with that. My dad tho. I've no idea on what'd happen if he learns about it
[18:48:32] <isekaijin> Oh.
[18:48:38] <Sadale> isekaijin, oh. Here you can pick up in those pickup points. So you'd get the packet to deliver to a pickup point. Then you pickup there

[18:51:33] <MootPoot> LOL
[18:51:44] <Sadale> MootPoot, This one attracts me because it claims that it dries off quick. This way I'd be able to use it more
[18:51:49] <MootPoot> lol
[18:52:08] <MootPoot> do you use sleep in the same room with your imouto
[18:52:08] <TsundereNoises> you could also use it to develop a special bond with a male friend!
[18:52:11] <Sadale> It may make a mess when I cum tho.

[18:53:26] <MootPoot> and your imouto would know

[18:58:06] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, hmm.
[18:58:11] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, maybe we could start one.
[18:58:26] <Sadale> Actually I think Urchin[emacs] deserves a site for sharing the pics that he shares

[19:29:38] <Sadale> Having sex is a social activity. onahole is a single player game.
[19:30:01] <Sadale> onahole has all those texture and stuffs. AFAIK vagina doesn't.
[19:30:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, You probably want to ask someone who has both experience of using onahole and experience with banging someone tho. like davic.
[19:30:35] <MootPoot> idk, ask ButterNoodle, he's had sex and used on onahole 
[19:30:38] * Sadale is a proud virgin :3
[19:30:47] <Sadale> oh. Ask him then

[19:32:22] <Sadale> aww. It's kind of sad to find that you can kind of get an imouto if you want. But you can't get an onee-san
[19:32:32] <Sadale> I mean given that you don't currently have one
[19:33:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just FYI, I know someone gay who had banged someone, fapped with hands and using onahole. He told me that all of the three are nice. But they all feel different.
[19:35:12] <Sadale> Personally I've fapped with my hands and with a onahole that I've got. And I can kind of confirm that. As for onahole tho I only have one data point. And the one I've got is a bit too lose. It's nice for intentionally ruining my orgasm tho xD
[19:35:25] <Sadale> But the cleanup. It takes forever to dry :(
[19:35:35] <Sadale> And I don't really have a nice place to dry it
[19:35:39] <MootPoot> its always the lonely virgins who are into the weirdist shit
[19:35:53] <Sadale> I mean I'm not lonely :3
[19:36:00] <MootPoot> you have IRC and an imouto
[19:36:01] <Sadale> I've got a cute imouto. I just won't bang her tho
[19:36:02] <MootPoot> what more do you want
[19:36:11] <MootPoot>  you wasted 50% of your chances
[19:36:12] <MootPoot> wow
[19:36:24] <Sadale> What did you mean?
[19:36:54] <Sadale> Here's what I want tho. Stop having to work and retire in somewhere with low living cost so that I can live off with my savings
[19:37:12] <Sadale> preferably to have my imouto to join me for retirement xD
[19:37:54] <Sadale> Not very likely. But she could get married away tho.
[19:38:21] <Sadale> damn I'm tired. time to sleep :34

[20:09:13] <MootPoot> What are women for but as beings for making us men get off our lazy asses and actually do something

[21:19:59] <Poeticode> time for some sweeeeeet coffee
[21:22:12] <Poeticode> been running fedora for like a month now. longest time i've ran linux without crying and going back to mac/windows
[21:22:23] <Bco1981> lol
[21:22:28] <Poeticode> i'm still crying but now i can't go back to mac/windows
[21:22:36] <Bco1981> why not ?
[21:22:52] <Poeticode> macbook is in the shop and this lappy doesn't have a windows license
[21:23:02] <Bco1981> windows is free
[21:23:02] <Poeticode> guess i could pirate a sketchy russian windows ISO
[21:23:28] <Bco1981> download the iso from microsoft
[21:23:34] <Bco1981> skip the key during the install
[21:23:46] <Poeticode> whoaaa
[21:24:15] <Bco1981> sure you will have a "your windows isn't activated" and you can't change some settings... but then it is really free
[21:24:19] <Roey> Poeticide! Long time no see!!
[21:24:26] <Poeticode> "Microsoft allows anyone to download Windows 10 for free and install it without a product key. It’ll keep working for the foreseeable future, with only a few small cosmetic restrictions." that's dope
[21:24:41] <Poeticode> waddup! I've just been lurking Roey

[21:24:54] <Sxem> shdve waited

[21:25:14] <Roey> Sxem: lol
[21:25:16] <Bco1981> i even bought 2
[21:25:22] <Roey> I bought 1
[21:25:24] <Roey> well
[21:25:28] <Roey> that was windows 7
[21:25:32] <Roey> like 10 years ago
[21:25:38] <Roey> or whenever win7 came out
[21:25:39] <Roey> god

[21:25:42] <Poeticode> now I feel even better about ordering the Framework lappy without a windows license
[21:25:59] <Roey> ah
[21:26:05] <Roey> what od you mean Framework
[21:26:10] <Poeticode> I guess that's how Windows can do this. All PC vendors pay for the windows license
[21:26:13] <Roey> is that a laptop brand?
[21:26:21] <Roey> Poeticode: aye
[21:26:32] <Poeticode> ya it's a dope modular and self-repairable/upgradeable laptop
[21:26:59] <Roey> oh cool I'm looking for a laptop so I'll check it out, thanks for letting me know about it!

[21:27:37] <brainwash> I recommend buying some used macbook
[21:28:08] <Bco1981> only if you go for looks
[21:28:11] <Roey> heh that closed laptop in the image on the bottom of their home page shows logo stickers of a bunch of different linux distros, and no Windows, lol
[21:28:30] <Bco1981> and don't care about whats inside... and that it actually does not suffucate it self when used
[21:28:34] <Roey> brainwash: I have a friend who installed linux on his macbook
[21:28:58] <Roey> my issue's this:
[21:29:21] <Roey> I don't want to spend a lot of money on a new laptop, because it'll fall in price by a huge amount the year after
[21:29:38] <Roey> meaning that if I wait a year, I could get better/bigger/faster components at the same price
[21:29:43] <Roey> but at the same time,
[21:29:59] <Roey> I don't want to buy a cheaper laptop because I have certain minimums I want to hit
[21:30:01] <Roey> like RAM
[21:30:03] <Roey> and graphics
