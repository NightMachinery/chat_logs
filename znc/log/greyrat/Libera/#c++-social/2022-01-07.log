[16:53:54] <dukwon> the only work i've done this week is telling other people what's wrong with their code via instant message
[16:54:01] <dukwon> version control seems beyond them
[16:57:16] <BIRDSORTING> i got my pfizer booster
[16:57:23] <BIRDSORTING> and was like laid down for 2 days feeling quite arse
[16:57:29] <BIRDSORTING> also it's like 30C here
[16:57:34] <BIRDSORTING> so i just watched movies for 2 days
[16:58:00] <ERROH> do you ac
[16:58:03] <BIRDSORTING> no
[16:58:06] <BIRDSORTING> nz is too mild for ac
[16:58:16] <BIRDSORTING> so it just goes between like 0 and 30
