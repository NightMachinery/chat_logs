[00:06:52] <lantech19446> I'm currently learning AWS in hopes of studying for the cloud practitioner but I just found out that azure has all sorts of free services that I might actually be able to use at my current work. My thought is that practical experience would probably be more heavily weighed than a certification and I should switch to studying azure, would you agree with this synopsis or is AWS just so dominant in
[00:06:54] <lantech19446> the industry that I really need to learn it to be desirable to most employers?
[00:12:19] <rawtaz> nothing wrong with learning azure, except that it's a horrible microsoft thing with all that brings
[00:12:35] <rawtaz> your reasoning is good, as long as one set aside the what it is part
[00:12:42] <rawtaz> lost of companies use azure and not aws
[00:12:54] <rawtaz> as i mentioned some time earlier, often due to cost reasons
[00:13:17] <lantech19446> rawtaz: I agree with the whole microsoft thing but we rely on their donations a lot and as a result we're being pushed towards azure more and more in fact there's only like 2 things they're gonna do on prem donations of in the new year 
[00:13:48] <rawtaz> yep. go for it. go learn azure :)
[00:14:35] <lantech19446> ok, I think ultimately i'll learn both but for right now i think i need to do azure
[00:14:50] <rawtaz> gotta be pragmatic about things
[00:16:31] <lantech19446> i'm about to get fucked i can feel it
[00:17:28] <rawtaz> huh? how
[00:19:40] <lantech19446> signing up for the account with azure and they won't accept voip phone numbers so I had to use my cell to verify and I know when I go to sign up for a personal account it's going to tell me I can't use the number on more than one account
[00:20:04] <rawtaz> hmm ok
[00:20:29] <rawtaz> we'll see
[00:20:35] <rawtaz> hopefully you dont need to create more than one account
[00:22:34] *** Quits: murii (~murii@2a02:a58:835a:1100:21a3:bcee:241b:be61) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:24:01] <lantech19446> I want one to use for my personal learning like what i'm doing with a class
[00:25:43] <rawtaz> well, you can always try using the same phone number on a second account, might just work.
[00:26:25] <lantech19446> what i'm really hoping is that since I used it only to verify and not as the contact number that it'll let me
[00:26:59] <lantech19446> if not i'll just talk to microsoft and be like look you want me to learn how to use your shit right well then let me through
[00:27:17] <rawtaz> if it's any comfort, i've used my phone number to verify logins for several different tenants of my customers
[00:27:27] <rawtaz> yes. dont worry aobut it now
[00:27:33] <rawtaz> thats a problem for later, if at all
[00:29:04] <lantech19446> yea, i'm probably just making mental obstacles for myself I bet it won't be an issue at all
[00:30:11] <lantech19446> holy shite microsoft actually has some free online classes for azure i'm shocked
[00:31:01] <rawtaz> MS are very agressive in their efforts to get people to use their services
[00:31:47] <lantech19446> lol they're really behind on linux images though RHEL 7 i'm already on 8.5
[00:36:24] <lantech19446> jesus no wonder they want people using azure, one of their SaaS identity software subscriptions starts at over 725,000 a year
[00:38:26] <rawtaz> hm
[00:42:37] <lantech19446> just clicking around I see about an equal amount of shit i could never use between AWS and azure but both of them just have a really impressive amount of shit you can do. The place where microsquish might have the edge on AWS is that virtual machines are free
[00:44:23] <lantech19446> ok apparently there's no truth in advertising not all of them are free
[00:44:35] <rawtaz> free in what sense?
[00:45:38] <lantech19446> when microsoft advertises always free services for azure one of them is that you can deploy unlimited virtual machines with windows or linux OS for free but some of them apparently do cost money
[00:46:06] <rawtaz> but.. can tou actually run them for free?
[00:46:08] <rawtaz> you*
[00:46:19] <rawtaz> if so, im curious, wheres the url to that?
[00:46:38] <rawtaz> also, its probably comparable to aws ec2 which has some free tiers
[00:46:58] <lantech19446> I'm assuming that on the ones you pay for it's the network egress that costs you money because it says software plan starts at .03/hour
[00:47:34] <rawtaz> i recall container instances are billeg for cpu and memory, per minute
[00:47:49] <rawtaz> can you just link me to where you read that virtual machines in azure are free?
[00:50:10] <lantech19446> hmm I think I misread it I was in the services that are free for 12mos I thought I was in the always free section when i saw that
[00:50:16] <lantech19446> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services/
[00:50:25] <lantech19446> in which case yes it's comparable to ec2
[00:50:30] <rawtaz> ok
[00:50:45] * rawtaz &
[00:51:07] <lantech19446> I think i just signed up for it needlessly
[00:52:30] <lantech19446> as much as we're being pushed to use azure I don't see anything we can really use, the azure active directory isn't even like a hybrid cloud offering it's specifically for access management for cloud services and other than maybe floating our website out there and freeing up one of our statics that way it looks largely useless to us

[05:19:36] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Be careful about the free tier.
[05:19:44] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Read the fine print very very careful.
[05:20:17] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: You might accidentally find yourself sleeping from the "free allowance" and suddenly paying premium, and it's very easy to rack up massive bills.
[05:24:18] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: I tried as hard as I could to opt out of the free credit for just that reason, they make it seem like you have but in the end they give it to you anyway :(. As great as they make it seem on their website azure active directory only works for cloud services so it's f*in useless to me I don't see anything I could use on there with the exception of the occasional virtual machine and I
[05:24:20] <lantech19446> have 14Tib of storage 32 gigs of ram and hyper-v for that. I honestly saw what you're talking about right off the bat some of the stuff that was supposed to be free really isn't and there's a couple services where they start at 725,000 dollars a month needless to say i'm less than impressed. 
[05:25:03] <kwilczynski> Yeah.
[05:26:05] <lantech19446> just more windoze bullshit at its finest though I'm sure there's stuff like that on AWS also
[05:26:09] <kwilczynski> There was (another one) post on HackerNews about (this time) Oracle Cloud doing some nasty things with their free tier, almost to a point of it being a scam.
[05:26:27] <kwilczynski> Free tier on any cloud is a pipedream.
[05:27:01] <kwilczynski> There are so many places where hidden costs creeps in... it's crazy.
[05:37:22] <lantech19446> That's why if I need a vps I just use vultr I know exactly what I'm spending up front
[05:45:01] <kwilczynski> Yeah.
[05:45:18] <kwilczynski> Scaleway for me for that same reason - cheap and no hidden cost.

[07:11:16] <lantech19446> lol I wish
[07:12:00] <lantech19446> i'm actually really worried about this now though. should i leave cloud learning for on the job or is there a way to be smart about this
[07:12:16] <kwilczynski> I don't have one
[07:12:21] <kwilczynski> No credit card for me
[07:13:13] <lantech19446> I genuinely wish I could say the same. I'm trying to dig out of so much debt
[07:13:42] <rawtaz> just check the pricing for the services you order - every time you order it says what itll cost, no?
[07:14:12] <lantech19446> nope
[07:14:28] <lantech19446> a lot of em don't cost until you run over a certain threshold so they're listed as free
[07:25:30] <lantech19446> I guess I just keep going and hope for the best, I'm just really risk averse right now
[07:28:03] <rawtaz> AWS has a dashboard or pricing calculator for current services, perhaps azure has something similar
[07:29:33] <lantech19446> i'm doing AWS currently I'll have to look for the pricing calculator. I know the teacher said every lab he gives us is available within the free tier so the only thing I really need to worry about is forgetting to shut it down or accidentally not shutting everything down but if that updates with whatever I do I should be able to see it

[14:30:35] <lantech19446> In America it's much more predatory they'd rather you have their card if you're poor especially if your credit is still good from lack of use that way you never pay them off and just become a source of income in perpetuity 
[14:32:58] <kwilczynski> Yeah, I know.

[14:36:44] <lantech19446> I finally have 132 dollars available on it and haven't had to go back to using it because I'm budgeting so I'm hopeful that will continue but I know I'm only one unplanned expense from being right back at the beginning

[23:31:05] <slayne> Thanks guys, started working in IT at 26 with very basic knowledge, only completed a small year-course. Got interested in Linux & Coding and my employers loved that. Got myself a Homelab, became obesessed with it, frustration ensued.. Landed my first Linux sysadmin job a year ago, learned new technologies, got head-hunted on LinkedIn and took the opportunity. I'm 32 now, it's been 6 years and I
[23:31:07] <slayne> never thought I could get here. 
[23:31:30] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: thats the one in your living room, right?
[23:31:57] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Maybe. I can't confirm nor deny this. :)

[23:32:35] <kwilczynski> slayne: Well done!
[23:32:39] <rawtaz> i mean, sysadmining linux boxes isnt really the same thing
[23:32:55] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Harsh words.
[23:33:11] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: that or accidentally finding out when im wearing my rubber duck suit in a debugging session
[23:33:15] * kwilczynski sysadmins cloud instances...
[23:33:30] <slayne> rawtaz: Not much other than some Ansible, using KVM and writing loads of scripts..
[23:33:35] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: well then youre into devops. but just managing some servers and networks isnt really devops, thats why i asked
[23:33:43] <rawtaz> slayne: okay. so the automation part, so to speak
[23:34:40] <slayne> rawtaz: Yeah, I can configure any kind of servers though, Tomcat, Apache, Load Balancing, NFS, etc. Still feel like an imposter lol
[23:34:40] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I don't want to be into DevOps, I want to be one of the cool kids - DevSecOps!

[23:41:57] <rawtaz> is there nothing else of interestg?
[23:42:20] <kubblai> im halfway through a pretty decent udemy course but it's just not hands on enough
[23:42:26] <kwilczynski> The Fair Lady of Training Videos ... or Nina.
[23:42:35] <kwilczynski> Recently released some Go content on YouTube.
[23:42:50] <kwilczynski> Not sure of the level/complexity she goes into.
[23:43:16] <kubblai> i think she covers on how to ioterate for 1 - 99 balloons
[23:43:23] <kwilczynski> s/Nina/Nana/
[23:43:28] <rawtaz> kubblai: pretty much everyeone i asked replied that they just did the official Go tutorial on the Go website.
[23:43:50] <kwilczynski> kubblai: Ah, OK. Add a mutex and some gorouties, and it'd be advanced level then :)
[23:43:57] <kwilczynski> :P
[23:44:23] <kubblai> hmm rawtaz but they're all a lot brighter than me - i have a real bad block when it comes to programming
[23:44:36] <kubblai> im still stuch on remember what a struct is 
[23:44:56] <kubblai> but i'll give that a blast then :)
[23:45:06] <lantech19446> kubblai: don't feel bad I do too, i'm trying to push through but programming just isn't my jam
[23:45:09] <rawtaz> kubblai: then its definitely a matter of not having something real to actually write
[23:45:16] <rawtaz> do you have a pet project at all?
[23:45:26] <kwilczynski> cat.go
[23:45:29] <rawtaz> its pointless trying to learn to code without having something to code
[23:45:29] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:46:00] <kwilczynski> Yeah.
[23:46:03] <kubblai> i have a guy at work who has made up a project for us to work together on. we're gonna build a go app which pulls a bitbucket repo grabs the readme and puts it in confluence
[23:46:27] <kwilczynski> Contributing to Open Source might be fun to.
[23:46:30] <kwilczynski> too*
[23:46:52] <kubblai> yeah true but atm i dont even know the basics of the language
[23:46:54] <slayne> I suggest writing a simple server / client socket application, this is always nice, then you reinvent a MUD :D
[23:47:22] <kubblai> i had an idea to do my own mytraceroute
[23:47:43] <kwilczynski> That's a nice idea.
[23:47:48] <kwilczynski> #approved
[23:47:50] <kwilczynski> Now.
[23:47:51] <kwilczynski> Make it so.
[23:47:52] <kubblai> heh
[23:47:58] <kubblai> ok jean luc
[23:47:59] * kwilczynski gives kubblai Pickard face.
[23:48:00] <slayne> Better yet, take a program like 'ls, grep, and implement your custom version of it !
[23:48:17] <rawtaz> kubblai: thats silly really, you dont need to use much Go for that heh
[23:48:17] <kwilczynski> Some people write regexp engine.
[23:48:29] <kwilczynski> Or... Lua interpreter.
[23:48:47] <kubblai> rawtaz: the guy just wanted to help me
[23:48:58] <kubblai> i said its not really needed and he agreed

[23:49:23] <kwilczynski> kubblai: I wanted to sell rawtaz a project idea some time ago for Ansible.
[23:49:30] <kwilczynski> kubblai: But he called me names and shun me... :/
[23:49:41] <kwilczynski> "something something NOT IN PYTHON ..."
[23:49:45] <kwilczynski> I sill have shivers.
[23:49:49] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:50:56] <kubblai> as long as they're not multiplying or you're losing control kwilczynski 
[23:51:15] <kubblai> oh wrong song
[23:51:18] <kwilczynski> LOL
[23:51:31] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:52:21] <rawtaz> kubblai: what i said still stands. it's too simple of a project
[23:52:40] <kubblai> the mtr one or the bitbucket pipeline ?
[23:52:55] <kubblai> rawtaz: ^
[23:53:54] <rawtaz> the bitbucket thing
[23:54:15] <kubblai> oh well i told the guy but he wants to help me so im not gonna turn him down
[23:55:27] <rawtaz> sigh
[23:55:37] <rawtaz> i thought you wanted to learn something
[23:55:44] <rawtaz> you dont need that guy to help you with that
[23:56:01] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: i just did what your wife does every day
[23:56:30] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: You never make me pancakes! 
[23:56:33] <kwilczynski> :>
[23:58:51] <kubblai> rawtaz: i have another gopher friend is going to help me rewrite mytraceroute in go
[23:59:04] <kubblai> and teach me some tips and tricks
