[02:22:21] <MarkYork> Hello everyone. I need some help with a client config for OpenVPN. My daughter's employer requested her to work from home, but did not provide her with a computer, so she'll be using her own computer, which has an ArchLinux install. I was quickly able to install and setup the VPN client for her and the connection to the server works fine. However, the server is pushing a route that should not be pushed because it's breaking 
[02:22:22] <MarkYork> the routing to almost all of the internet. Basically it is pushing a default gateway that is on the companies network, but the routing is broken. I chose to manually delete that route from the main routing table and that fixed the problem. We tested the sites that she needs to use and they work fine without that route, so I think it's completely unnecessary. We can add it manually if we need it in the future. What I want to do 
[02:22:22] <MarkYork> is to delete that route that's being added during the connection to the server after the VPN gets connected automatically. Is this possible through the client's config file?
[02:27:30] <wiscii> MarkYork: use `pull-filter ignore "reditect-gateway"`
[02:27:43] <wiscii> in the client config
[02:28:40] <wiscii> direct*
[02:29:38] <wiscii> reditecting a gateway is not possible ;)

[02:36:03] <MarkYork> @wiscii, That worked, thanks mate!!!
[02:53:45] <wiscii> MarkYork: be aware, that could break other routing required by the company IDK ..
[02:54:12] <wiscii> probably not tho 
[03:02:01] <MarkYork> the routing table looks identical for the moment. If they change anything on the server settings, that could break something. It would be better if they fix this on the server

[11:46:34] <UncleKiwi> Hi everyone - I am curious if I can on the OpenVPN server if I can define like a second factor specific to the computer connecting ie like computer-name or mac address of a NIC or something 
[11:47:34] <UncleKiwi> my intention is to reduce the chance that a stolen openvpn config with keys etc could even be used
[11:47:53] <UncleKiwi> if you can smell what im trying to cook up 
[11:50:06] <gh555222-Vim> well, you could use an intermediary ncat or iptables restriction
[11:50:19] <gh555222-Vim> ACLs, MAC filtering, etc
[11:50:51] <gh555222-Vim> the problem you are speaking of is by no means specific to OpenVPN
[11:51:18] <gh555222-Vim> #networking or #security may help, or something more OS specific like #linux or #debian
[11:51:52] <UncleKiwi> thank you 
[12:20:03] <ordex> UncleKiwi: you can also have the client send the MAC address and check it on the server with a script
[12:20:10] <ordex> but the MAC can be easily spoofed
[12:20:46] <ordex> same the computer name..so normally 2FA is implemented by means of something more sophisticated

[13:14:58] <UncleKiwi> ordex: hi and thanks 
[13:15:06] <ordex> np :)
[13:15:47] <UncleKiwi> ordex: how to get the client to send the mac
[13:15:56] <UncleKiwi> ?
[13:16:16] <ordex> check --push-peer-info in the manpage
[13:16:54] <UncleKiwi> I want an always on type vpn so 2FA would bug the user unless I could get it to recheck every 30days
[13:17:03] <UncleKiwi> rather than every connection
[13:17:44] <ordex> yap
[13:18:03] <ordex> that's doable - I hink using the auth-token in combination with 2FA - this is how people implement it 
[13:18:07] <ordex> *think
[13:18:25] <UncleKiwi> it seems the biggest threat is stolen keys/configfile
[13:18:34] <UncleKiwi> thats what Im trying to avoid 
[13:19:19] <UncleKiwi> probably wont happen but if it did - it would be great to make a bit more difficult to use that into
[13:19:23] <UncleKiwi> *info
[13:19:54] <UncleKiwi> ok auth tokens and 2fa - I probably need to read about that 
[13:20:18] <ordex> UncleKiwi: if it happens you just revoke it
[13:20:32] <ordex> UncleKiwi: how about just user-password ?
[13:21:03] <UncleKiwi> I guess the user password could be stolen as easy as the config 
[13:21:24] <UncleKiwi> revoking is great - but how do you know when you need to revoke - 
[13:21:47] <UncleKiwi> stoken keys could occur without you knowing 
[13:22:01] <UncleKiwi> *sotlen
[13:22:10] <UncleKiwi> *stolen
[13:22:27] <UncleKiwi> getting late here ahaha
[13:23:24] <UncleKiwi> maybe im worrying to much  
[13:24:14] <ordex> heh
[13:24:18] <ordex> true, it may happen
[13:24:35] <ordex> but then don't use the MAC address - as it brings no security whatsoever
[13:24:50] <ordex> if somebody got the key, I am sure he was able to look at the mac address too
[13:25:13] <UncleKiwi> yeah good point

[16:49:13] <mindhunter> Hey. I am trying to run openvpn on a linode instance and have generated the config file but I cant connect to the internet when I use openvpn. Using the same config file in a different machine doesnt appear to have the same problem. What am I missing here?
[16:50:50] <rob0> maybe NAT?  Maybe the HOWTO?  "Generated the config file," huh?  How did you do that?
[16:58:15] <mindhunter> rob0: I used an openvpn-install.sh script from github
[16:59:32] <rob0> I'd suggest going through the entire official howto step-by-step to see what you missed.
[16:59:54] <mindhunter> Could you point me to that resource?
[17:02:42] <rob0> It's linked from community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki , look for HOWTO, and there are other good links there as well.
[17:13:26] <ordex> mindhunter: on top of what rob0 is saying, if you need help with a 'problem' it may be better to provide information about that. i.e. log of the error

[17:46:53] <ordex> not necessarily. it may be a routing issue on the client
