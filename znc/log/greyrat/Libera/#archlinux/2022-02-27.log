[07:07:12] <gimmel> Hi all, I'm trying to get a new installation using btrfs + luks. I've followed the same methodologies as found here -> https://austinmorlan.com/posts/arch_linux_install/#correcting-errors. When I try and boot, the boot process halts because it can't find /dev/mapper/luks - which makes sense because it gets to this failure without first asking for the password to unlock the partition. I can't figure out

[10:18:33] <rabbitnightmare> I wasnt arguing against it
[10:19:04] <rabbitnightmare> my point is, if you are going to include bloat, include whats necessary for basic things to function when choosing a desktop installation
[10:19:14] <rabbitnightmare> thats all
[10:19:57] <openfbtd> Including things a bunch of people would easily never need is at the very least odd and goes against Arch's core design

[10:20:25] <rabbitnightmare> but your argument was that developers dont like openrc because its too hard

[11:49:43] <dmc> I'm not at all familiar with firewalld

[12:03:41] <dmc> ^
[12:03:44] <tirnanog> the only way that netfilter could still be filtering out packets at this point is if iptables - using the xtables backend - had previously been used to define some rules.
[12:04:49] <DrNefario> is there a way to check if that's the case? I do have iptables installed
[12:05:19] <tirnanog> you would need to have iptables installed (instead of iptables-nft), then run: iptables-save

[12:05:47] <tirnanog> if you see nothing, or simply the three built-in chains in the *filter table with ACCEPT, then it's not a factor.

[12:06:17] <DrNefario> yep, there's nothing
[12:06:34] <tirnanog> actually, there's another way, even with iptables-nft installed. run: iptables-legacy-save
[12:06:55] <DrNefario> something very strange is happenning, I can ping my machine over IPv6 but not IPv4
[12:07:01] <tirnanog> ok, so netfilter can't possibly be dropping packets at this point.
[12:07:44] <DrNefario> yep, nothing from legacy either
[12:07:44] <tirnanog> there can be other reasons for packets not to go where you want them to go, of course. missing nat rules that you were using, martian packets, routing tables not in order etc.

[12:17:53] <tirnanog> that being said, I did miss something. one also has to check that ip6tables-legacy-save comes up empty to prove non-involvement of netfilter. it's because iptables doesn't support dual-stack rulesets like nftables does.

[12:34:04] <tirnanog> or 0/32. I forget which notation it uses just now but you get the idea. if packets to 192.168.1.0/24 are being misdirected over the wg link, it must have been requested to set up a covering route.
[12:34:19] <DrNefario> it was something I had in 99-wg0.network

[12:42:48] <tirnanog> that makes no sense. you would need to instruct wireguard on your phone that 192.168.1.0/24 is reachable over the tunnel.

[12:43:37] <tirnanog> I'm assuming that you're trying to roam with your phone there.
[12:43:42] <DrNefario> isn't that what AllowedIPs is for?
[12:43:44] <tirnanog> yep.
[12:44:12] <tirnanog> also, the inverse path would need to be correct. let's say that your phone contacts 192.168.1.77 and goes over the tunnel accordingly.
[12:44:36] <tirnanog> 192.168.1.77 would need to know to send the packet back _through_ the wireguard peer that your phone is conected to.
[12:44:45] <tirnanog> so there's a potential routing consideration there too.
[12:44:54] <DrNefario> yeah, I don't exactly know what I'm doing... does it show?
[12:44:57] *** Quits: BOHverkill (~BOHverkil@holarse/bohverkill) (Client Quit)
[12:45:09] <tirnanog> so, where does wireguard run within your LAN?
[12:45:14] *** Joins: spare (~tazv6mrba@user/spareproject)
[12:45:18] <tirnanog> is it on your router or some other host within 192.168.1.0/24?
[12:45:38] <DrNefario> it's on 192.168.1.77
[12:45:43] <tirnanog> so you port forward presumably?
[12:45:48] <DrNefario> yes
[12:46:02] <DrNefario> I was planning to do that after verifying that it works locally
[12:46:05] <tirnanog> in that case, the easiest thing to do is probably to use SNAT. it's a kludge but would suffice.
[12:46:15] *** Joins: xoan9 (~xoan@user/xoan)
[12:46:26] <DrNefario> I've never heard of SNAT honestly

[12:47:03] <DrNefario> lo, enp0s25, wg0
[12:47:43] *** Quits: noobaroo (~solas@user/noobaroo) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[12:48:05] <tirnanog> so, using iptables rule terminology for the moment, you could have a rule that does: -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i wg0 -o enp0s25 -j SANT
[12:48:07] <tirnanog> SNAT
[12:48:12] *** Quits: xoan (~xoan@user/xoan) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:48:12] *** xoan9 is now known as xoan
[12:48:53] <DrNefario> so that would enable the wireguard network to access my local network
[12:48:59] <tirnanog> what would happen is that the source IP address gets rewritten en-route. let's say your phone connects to 192.168.1.1. it passes through 192.168.1.77. the source address would get rewritten to 192.168.1.77 in the course of being forwarded to 192.168.1.1. that way, the inverse path is as it should be.
[12:49:31] <tirnanog> SNAT also makes sure that the destination address gets replaced accordingly on the way back, as it were.

[12:49:56] *** Quits: ketchupicecream (~ketchupic@user/ketchupicecream) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[12:49:58] <DrNefario> that does sound like what I need
[12:50:04] <tirnanog> the downside is that it's a kludge. the IP address of your phone won't be seen by any of the hosts contacted. it's easier if you have wireguard run on the router.
[12:50:12] <tirnanog> it will work, though.
[12:50:35] <tirnanog> in short, everything will appear to come from 192.168.1.77. but maybe you can live with that.
[12:50:41] <DrNefario> would running it on the router let it just merge into the local network?
[12:50:42] *** Joins: Twig (~Twig@45.152.183.45)
[12:50:55] <tirnanog> running it on the router helps because your LAN hosts already have a default route pointing to that exact host.

[12:52:07] <tirnanog> especially as wireguard IPs are static.
[12:52:31] <DrNefario> wouldn't that only really make a difference when something wants to contact my phone unsolicited?

[12:52:39] <tirnanog> no?
[12:52:50] <tirnanog> data flows in two directions.
[12:52:58] <tirnanog> you don't want the inverse path to lead through your router and out to the interwebz.
[12:53:11] <tirnanog> because that's not currently where wireguard is running.
[12:53:30] <tirnanog> it's pretty simple if you think about it. how can all of your LAN hosts possibly know that 192.168.1.77 is the correct nexthop to reach your phone?
[12:53:34] <tirnanog> they won't unless you tell them.
[12:53:39] *** Joins: threat (~wyoung@about/web/wez)
[12:53:48] <tirnanog> or use the SNAT kludge so that the packet appears to emanate from 192.168.1.77 to begin with.
[12:53:53] *** Quits: threat (~wyoung@about/web/wez) (Client Quit)
[12:54:12] <DrNefario> oh I understand now
[12:54:16] <tirnanog> good.
[12:54:29] <tirnanog> so you could fix it with some static routes also.
[12:54:31] <tirnanog> that's cleaner.
[12:54:45] <tirnanog> but potentially annoying. you'd need to do it for every host that your phone may wish to contact.
[12:54:52] <dmc> is kludge a networking term?
[12:55:05] <DrNefario> so, without the SNAT, even when the packets are forwarded the phone's IP would be unchanged, so that's where the data would be sent back to. that's a correct summary?
[12:55:43] <tirnanog> dmc: it seems to be used generally in computing. the etymology is a little unclear. there are some different theories about it.

[12:57:36] <tirnanog> DrNefario: as things stand, you don't want the default route being used as the basis of the routing decision that guides the return packet.
[12:57:46] <tirnanog> because that will go through your router, and that's not where wireguard is.
[12:58:13] <tirnanog> it will get sent to your ISP and dropped.
[12:58:39] <tirnanog> (without having been encapsulated by wireguard first)
[12:59:14] <tirnanog> so: either add a static route for your phone wg IP at the hosts that need to know, or use SNAT where wg is running.
[12:59:30] <tirnanog> or, deploy wireguard at the router itself.
[13:00:13] <tirnanog> for reasons that are hopefully obvious by now, the latter option is preferable, wherever it is practical.
[13:00:42] <DrNefario> yeah, that makes things so much cleaner

[13:04:12] <tirnanog> right now, snat is probably your safest option. it's ugly but will guarantee that you can't accidentally contact a LAN host in such a way that a plain packet leaks out to your ISP.
[13:04:35] <DrNefario> so how would I actually set that up?
[13:04:56] <tirnanog> in firewalld? I don't know off-hand but I'm sure it can do it. I know how to do it in iptables and nftables directly.

[13:07:29] <tirnanog> in fact, masquerading would work.
[13:07:46] <tirnanog> so that's a keyword to look for in the firewalld documentation.
[13:08:41] <DrNefario> the wireguard wiki page uses masquerade in postup and postdown https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/WireGuard#Server_configuration
[13:08:42] <phrik> Title: WireGuard - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[13:09:07] <tirnanog> yeah, it would be easier that way.
[13:09:36] <tirnanog> the only snag is that if you inject rules from without a firewall wrapper in use, said wrapper may become confused, as its internal state deviates from that of the ruleset.
[13:09:38] *** Joins: timm (~timm@user/timm)
[13:09:46] <dmc> DrNefario, the rules in the forward and postrouting chains in the conf I shared are roughly the equivalent
[13:09:47] <tirnanog> but it might be ok. I don't use firewalld so it's hard to say.
[13:09:59] <DrNefario> oh really? thanks dmc
[13:10:24] <tirnanog> eventually, you get to a point where it ends up being preferable to write rulesets manually.
[13:10:56] <tirnanog> at a cost of not knowing how to do it exactly in trending-wrapper-of-the-moment.

[13:14:22] *** Joins: xamindar (~quassel@68.21.152.251)

[13:18:07] <tirnanog> if you just want to try it ad-hoc, and given that you presently have a clean slate, make sure IPv4 forwarding is on the run: iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i wg0 -o enp0s25 -j MASQUERADE. iptables-save will subsequently confirm the addition of this rule and should find that your phone is able to contact any LAN host.
[13:18:12] <tirnanog> then*
[13:18:57] <tirnanog> that is, as long as AllowedIps has been attended to phone-side.
[13:19:22] <DrNefario> when I run that command it says "Can't use -i with POSTROUTING"
[13:19:31] <tirnanog> oh right.
[13:19:57] <tirnanog> that's fine. it's not really needed. you can drop -i wg0.
[13:20:30] <DrNefario> so that just means that it won't be limited to a single interface

[18:18:57] <KDDLB> hey y'all 
[18:19:11] <ZeroV1p3r> hi KDDLB
[18:19:15] <KDDLB> what would be the best way to "convert" an NTFS partition to a Linux-native FS, like ext4 or btrfs?
[18:20:05] <KDDLB> the idea I had was making a Linux data partition as big as the free space on the NTFS partition and moving data from the NTFS part to the LinuxFS part
[18:20:08] <KDDLB> would that be a good idea?
[18:20:09] <ZeroV1p3r> format the partition and make new one with ext4 or what you want
[18:20:48] <Warepire> ZeroV1p3r: That's a good way to loose all your data if you want to keep it
[18:20:54] *** Quits: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[18:21:09] <KDDLB> yeah I was gonna say, I have data I want to keep
[18:21:21] <ZeroV1p3r> aha sorry KDDLB
[18:21:33] <ZeroV1p3r> use mkfs
[18:21:52] <cyphertite> KDDLB:  back your 'stuff' up, first and ensure it is then restorable from external media.  After that, create new partitions and filesystems 
[18:22:21] <Warepire> I researched it some years ago when I migrated an NTFS drive from my Windows era to ext4, I didn't find any way to do it other than copy all data somewhere else, re-format drive, copy data back.

[18:24:44] <KDDLB> and when I make more free space on the NTFS partition, shrink that one and make the linux one bigger

[23:48:52] <Khorne> kib, do you have a .wgetrc?

[23:49:22] <kib> there is a .wget-hsts fwiw
[23:49:28] <ta180m> I'm guessing it's a DNS problem because it's always a DNS problem
[23:49:30] <ZeroV1p3r> so the first time i installed and configured archlinux i installed gnome but it take a lot of ram, so i installed mate and the problem when i delete gnome packages the system break
[23:49:36] <ta180m> delete the .wget-hsts

[23:52:05] <kib> ok so how do i make paru use --inet4-only ?
[23:52:13] <Scimmia> ZeroV1p3r: "the system break" means nothing. You have to be specific if you want help
[23:52:41] <Scimmia> kib: assuming it's actually makepkg doing the download, see makepkg.conf
[23:53:06] <Eisenhans> kib: you can use Khorne's method. write a .wgetrc config file
[23:53:16] <ZeroV1p3r> i mean with system break = when i reboot archlinux open to me an tty
[23:54:02] <Khorne> Seems pretty not broken
[23:54:13] <Khorne> Install a login manager
