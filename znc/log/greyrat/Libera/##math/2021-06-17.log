[00:37:20] <cherim> But this is such an overcomplicated approach. Why would one want a cubic constraint deom a 3x3 Det...
[00:38:23] <Nickssen> the thing is that this "determinant method" lets us by-pass lagrange multipliers
[00:39:54] <Nickssen> it forces grad f and grad g to be collinear so solving the determinant gives us when that happens
[00:40:56] <cherim> If you want, you can take the third vector to be (0, 0, 1), then (0, 1, 0), then (1, 0, 0)

[01:02:28] <cherim> This is a 3D problem with two contraints x^2+y^2=4, z+x-1=0. You need one scalar equation from the extremum condition.

[02:42:34] <Inline> Remark: velocity does not depend per se on time. it's an attributed dependence by us. when you drive a car your velocity probably depends much more on how much fuel you burn at a time instant, not on time as such. But fuel burnt at one time makes up for a second kind of dependence which is congruent with the attributed one. Hence this dependence is of a secondary kind. When there is no friction of any kind and you don't burn fuel
[02:42:34] <Inline> other than the initial step you can keep constant velocity, hence time just does not play any role. so when time does not play a role we say v=const otherwise we indicate the time dependence via v=v(t).

[02:55:01] <greenbagels> Inline: this cause-and-effect viewpoint is not really relevant to the math

[02:55:45] <Inline> that is not an argument
[02:55:47] <acd> (I'm speaking of continous quantities)
[02:56:18] <acd> velocity is a function of time
[02:56:31] <acd> but it's also a function of various other quantities
[02:56:42] <greenbagels> like you could argue some particle falling into a gravitational well has a velocity that isn't "primarily" dependent on time, because its time dependence comes from the gravitational force acting on it
[02:56:54] <greenbagels> but when we say something is a function of time, we don't really care about cause/effect
[02:57:00] <greenbagels> in a physical sense
[02:57:08] <acd> velocity is a function of time in the sense that a function has a definition
[02:57:25] <acd> and velocity can be seen to be a function of time right
[02:57:29] <Inline> velocity depends on your will first then on how much energy you invest
[02:57:40] <acd> :o
[02:57:41] <greenbagels> no
[02:57:44] <Inline> right, so the time dependence is of a secondary kind
[02:57:46] <greenbagels> velocity depends on your choice of reference frame

[02:58:15] <greenbagels> no; these kinds are artificial
[02:58:36] <Inline> if it were pure functional dependence of the first kind nobody would be able to choose deliberately their velocity
[02:58:47] <acd> what do you mean by this
[02:58:56] <acd> you can choose your velocity but it is still a function of time
[02:59:25] <acd> each moment in time corresponds to exactly one velocity
[02:59:52] <Inline> it's more a function of another thing, but you can tie in time dependence as a secondary kind and that's how we deal with it
[03:00:02] <Inline> right
[03:00:12] <acd> what is the definition of "secondary kind"
[03:02:18] <acd> any determinate quantity is a function of time
[03:03:17] <Inline> a constant velocity does not need to be time dependent
[03:03:26] <acd> it's still a function of time though
[03:03:41] <acd> the definition of a function is that each input corresponds to exactly one output
[03:04:22] <acd> a constant velocity is a function of time even though we refer to that being independent of time

[08:33:57] *** Joins: deavmi (~tbk@user/deavmi)
[08:34:09] <tusko> I'm struggling to wrap my head around contradiction vs contrapositive.
[08:34:28] <tusko> Take n \in Z, if n^2 is odd, then n is odd.
[08:35:34] <tusko> I could say suppose n is even, so n^2 = (2n)^2 = 4n^2 = 2(2n^2) = 2k (k = 2n^2 \in Z) which is even.
[08:35:44] <tusko> That, to me seems like a contrapositive proof.
[08:37:09] <tusko> But say I argued: Suppose n is odd and n^2 is even. So n = 2n+1 and n^2 = (2n+1)^2 = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1 = 2k + 1 (k = 2n^2 + 2n \in Z).
[08:37:26] <tusko> But then n^2 is odd, a contradiction.
[08:37:39] <tusko> Do I have this right in my head?
[08:39:28] <PlanckWalk> Yes, though they're much more similar on this tiny toy example thanin practice
[08:40:50] <PlanckWalk> Mainly because you can explicitly specify "all even numbers are of the form 2k, and all odd numbers of the form 2k+1"
[08:41:48] <PlanckWalk> Your proofs woudl be quite different for "if n^2 is divisible by 997, then n is divisible by 997"
[08:42:00] <PlanckWalk> Err, not divisible :-/
[08:42:39] <PlanckWalk> The contrapositive proof would be almost the same (just replace 2 by 997)
[08:43:34] <PlanckWalk> The contradiction proof would have to go more like "n = 997k+1 or n=997k+2 or ... or n=2k+996"
[08:43:41] <PlanckWalk> Err, 997k+996
[08:45:28] <PlanckWalk> and for each case, use the 997-divisibility of n^2 to get a contradiction.
[08:45:44] <PlanckWalk> (BTW, the variables you chose for your example are wack.)
[08:46:18] <PlanckWalk> (You can't say n = 2n+1 there.  Use "There exists m in Z such that n = 2m+1" instead, or something)

[11:10:48] <quarterback> Probably a general solution of many types of curves doesn't exist.
[11:11:29] <quarterback> or can it be that different types of curves such as circle, ellipse can fit into a generic type of curves.
[11:11:48] <quarterback> Circle is a special case of ellipse.
[11:12:54] <quarterback> The solution may seem like finding differentiability at point (a,b) and the slope which may give its tangent.
[11:13:26] <quarterback> y = mx+c is such slope which may also be a tangent to a curve.
[11:13:53] <quarterback> acd, Does it make sense?

[11:15:33] <quarterback> I am guessing that y=mx+c is the tangent and a dy/dx is its slope

[11:18:41] <quarterback> int-e, I am kind of looking into finding differentiability at (a,b) so that its slope at that point gives possibly its tangent.
[11:18:53] <quarterback> int-e, This is what acd was arriving at.
[11:20:37] <quarterback> int-e, A reasonable assumption is that only one tangent of a curve passes through (a,b) unless the curve is a point circle at (a,b).
[11:20:50] <quarterback> This is probably a theorem already proved.
[11:20:51] <acd> if I have tangent line hitting the origin assume there's a point on f(x) above this line. Then between some intersection of the line and this point has values only above the line.

[12:27:14] <quarterback> You havent' described what those functions about Ed and Eg and Es are.
[12:28:07] <quarterback> each of the three functions would be integrated and added
[12:28:40] <Guest45> Ed = is a data term(I am assuming it is just pixel intensities), Eg is related to epipolar geometry between 2 stereo images.
[12:29:06] <Guest45> Es is a "regularizing" term(related to denoising and smoothing)

[23:53:48] <Z-module> dextaa: hmmm, sounds wrong that  Q \cap [0,1]  and  [0,1]  (reals)  would be elementarily equivalent. Isn't the non-existence of certain sups and infs in (only) the first set a first-order thing to express?
[23:54:44] <Z-module> oh wait, yeah, the specific sets lacking sups aren't expressible, sets such as  {x : x^2 < 1/2}   since the constant 1/2 isn't in the language, or whatever.
