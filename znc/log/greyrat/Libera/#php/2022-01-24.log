[00:16:17] <Nekomander> chazy, you can do a more proper leveling system like this: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/380ca6ba53c942f0927ee5fc87abdac8
[00:17:32] <Nekomander> Then all you have to do it store the character's EXP points. $character->strength = 271192;   <--- That strenght is now level 42.  Then cap the amount of EXP they can have.
[00:17:55] <Nekomander> For example: 984038 is max exp that will get the person to level 99.

[00:31:47] <Nekomander> chazy, with a slight change to the formula, you can control $baseExp to determine what it takes to make the very first level up. https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/42130bbe77524e92bb9cedf384346dbe

[16:46:23] <Kadigan_> Hey all. I'm writing a sort of "recipe parser" for something, and I'd like to expose *some* functions (like rand, ceil, floor, round...) to the script, as well as mathematical operations, but I don't want to expose the whole PHP (like I would with eval()). Is there a known way to safely do this without writing a parser/validator from scratch?
[16:49:59] <Kadigan_> My current idea is to use RPN (so that "2+2*2" becomes "2 2 * 2 +" and "round(val, 0)" becomes "val 0 round"), which I can more easily parse and build the final calculation with... Does that make sense?
[16:55:34] <Blondie101010> if all you allow is basic Math, look for a Math parser
[16:55:56] <Blondie101010> if not, you're making a new programming language
[16:56:59] *** Joins: Alex8532 (~Alex8532@user/alex8532)
[17:04:15] <Naktibalda> Kadigan_: Symfony has library for that: https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/expression_language/syntax.html
[17:07:51] <Kadigan_> Naktibalda: that's actually very cool... but from what I can see (on that page), I don't see a way to actually limit it; it still allows access to all of PHP, it's just a different syntax. Or am I wrong?

[17:08:39] <Kadigan_> Blondie101010: I guess I'll go with RPN then (at least for now) - that allows me to run a check on all terms to see if they're either literals or allowed operations.
[17:11:50] <biberu> Kadigan_: if you need to write something yourself pratt parser might be a useful keyword
[17:13:15] <Naktibalda> Kadigan_: it isn't full PHP, you get only one function permitted by default

[18:02:19] <relipse> Good morning
[18:02:27] <FightingFalcon> Please visit this site: https://www.defensehere.com/en/ scroll down to the second slider. The tab lists all the countries in the database, and all countries have associated companies. the container lists all the posts related to that company. So when a user comes to the site, php script checks the database, creates the tabs from country names, and then creates companies associated to all countries
[18:02:27] <FightingFalcon> and create 10 posts about the company. it uses wordpress queries. This is very inefficient and loads the server.What do you recommend?
[18:05:05] <Naktibalda> don't generate all countries
[18:06:45] <relipse> there is only 10 countries there?
[18:07:13] <FightingFalcon> 11
[18:07:21] <relipse> 11 countries isn't going to load down the server
[18:08:11] <FightingFalcon> well, it does. because there are more than 25 companies and i have to do a wordpress query for them
[18:09:02] <relipse> what does your code look like then?
[18:09:57] <FightingFalcon> um maybe you want to check?
[18:10:04] <relipse> yeah paste it in a pastebin

[18:11:24] <relipse> mathematically 11 * 25 is not that many, if you are doing a query inside a for loop then yes, that's not good
[18:11:31] <FightingFalcon> i guess
[18:11:42] <FightingFalcon> i realised that when i was pasting you :D
[18:11:56] <relipse> yes that's what I suspected
[18:12:01] <relipse> you are doing a query in a for loop
[18:12:20] <relipse> are you familiar with big O notation?
[18:12:28] <FightingFalcon> I need to make the query single time and store it in a variable?
[18:12:33] <FightingFalcon> O notation?
[18:13:05] <relipse> big O notation is how you measure complexity of an algorithm
[18:13:23] <relipse> What you need to do is fetch them all above the for loop
[18:13:41] <relipse> and then you will have all the data fetched, rather than querying the database each time
[18:13:49] <FightingFalcon> in a variable right?
[18:14:13] <relipse> yeah in some sort of array or something yes a variable
[18:14:24] <FightingFalcon> ok lets see how it would work .d
[18:14:38] <relipse> Basically the code you pasted is O(n^2)
[18:14:50] <relipse> and your calling the database each time
[18:15:10] <FightingFalcon> yes
[18:15:35] <relipse> that will slow down your code tremendously and put unnecessary load on the server

[18:17:55] <FightingFalcon> and this?
[18:18:08] <FightingFalcon> this shortcode queries the results of a category in wp
[18:18:17] <relipse> I'm not sure about the shortcode stuff
[18:18:34] <relipse> just work on getting a query first then you can look up in a php array or something

[18:19:36] <FightingFalcon> 	$countrylist = $wpdb->get_results('SELECT country FROM firmcountry WHERE lang="' . $curlang . '" ORDER BY date DESC', OBJECT);
[18:19:48] <FightingFalcon> this code gets the names of countries to put in the tab
[18:19:55] <FightingFalcon> foreach ($countrylist as $xcountry) {
[18:20:01] <FightingFalcon> gets each country row

[18:20:17] *** Joins: clarjon_1 (~clarjon1@user/clarjon1)
[18:20:20] <FightingFalcon> from this query, how do i get the country row?
[18:20:30] <relipse> right so you need to get all the country rows
[18:20:39] <relipse> and sttore in an array
[18:20:56] <relipse> probably write another function to help you keep the logic clean
[18:21:39] <FightingFalcon> ok
[18:22:25] <relipse> Get this: SELECT firm, color, id FROM firmcountry WHERE lang="' . $curlang . '" AND country="' . $xcountry->country . '" ORDER BY date DESC  outside of the for loop
[18:22:54] <relipse> you might need something like "SELECT country, lang, firm, color, id FROM firmcountry ORDER BY date DESC"
[18:23:10] <relipse> that will gather all of your firmcountry items
[18:23:13] <relipse> right?
[18:23:23] <FightingFalcon> yes
[18:23:43] <relipse> then you can write a new function that does that and stores them in a php array so you can do a lookup

[18:42:21] <relipse> yeah Naktibalda is right
[18:42:30] <relipse> if you look at his code, he is also doing a second loop: foreach ($firmlist as $xfirm) {
[18:42:40] <relipse> he might be able to refactor that out
[18:42:44] <Naktibalda> 1 query is much better than 20 queries, especially if the number of queries grows with amount of data
[18:43:45] <FightingFalcon> https://ctxt.io/2/AABg-mg5EA
[18:44:03] <FightingFalcon> whats the function to get all the arrays where country property is X
[18:44:58] <Naktibalda> FightingFalcon: print <pre> before print_r
[18:45:02] <relipse> FightingFalcon: i think you'll have to make your own array
[18:45:10] <relipse> an associative array
[18:45:49] <FightingFalcon> isnt this asociative array?
[18:46:14] <relipse> do echo '<pre>';

[18:55:33] <Naktibalda> that's nothing compared to gains you get by reducing number of queries
[18:55:52] <relipse> yes you will likely need another loop to gather the data into an associative array
[18:56:02] <relipse> but it beats searching for it every time in a linear array
[18:56:10] <relipse> and what Naktibalda said
[18:57:24] <FightingFalcon> mmmmm i have an idea
[18:58:05] <Naktibalda> iterating a loop having 100 items is many orders of magnitude faster than executing 100 queries even if N is the same (100)

[19:37:06] <Naktibalda> instead of doing nested loops you could transform your data to associative array using contry code as key
[19:37:57] <FightingFalcon> i think the slow down is because of wp queries
[19:38:06] <Naktibalda> foreach ($alllist as $country) { $listByCountry[$country->country] []= $country;
[19:38:42] <FightingFalcon> thanks a lot
[19:38:56] <Naktibalda> decode/encode is completly unnecessary in 	$js = count(json_decode(json_encode($alllist), TRUE));
[19:39:45] <Naktibalda> and you should use foreach instead of for in that for-count loop
[19:42:37] <FightingFalcon> why foreach?
[19:43:01] <relipse> it looks cooler
[19:43:25] <relipse> do you see what Naktibalda is saying about having the $listByCountry[] associative array
[19:43:45] <relipse> that will allow you to easily look it up at O(1) speeds
[19:44:06] <FightingFalcon> yes im on it relipse, thanks
[19:44:56] <Naktibalda> it would reduce O(n^2) to O(n), but it shouldn't make much difference for array this size, unless there is a hidden query in that code

[21:53:10] <__adrian> note this is not the reason most people use it.

[21:56:46] <relipse> so basically because we want to handle the error as an Exception

[23:18:04] <eXtr3m0> wouldn't an IPv6 address always address the private range?
[23:19:02] <eXtr3m0> yeah whatever. #technicallythetruth
[23:24:06] <znf> I think that refers to fe80:: and ::1 style of IPs?
[23:24:52] <AllenJB> "private" IP ranges refer to ranges reserved for private networks or test usage that should not be (directly) addressable from other networks.
[23:28:12] <BadAdviceCat> znf, basically, I can setup 192.168.100.100 and nobody can go to this address, but it is great for testing PHP scripts offline. I do not use 127.0.0.1 because the server is instead hosted in my Virtual Machine. :D
[23:29:41] <BadAdviceCat> It's also nice to be able to use that filter tool to exclude private IPs when you have this set up for realsies on the internet, production server. A nice $5 VPS.
[23:30:03] <znf> I know what private ranges are...
[23:31:13] <relipse> are VPNs subject to law enforcement?

[23:34:11] <BadAdviceCat> VPNs are useful to get around government censorship, or to help conceal identity for high profile activists. Things like that.
[23:34:20] <znf> ...or to access your corporate network
[23:34:31] <znf> or to tunnel resources from site-to-site in an enterprise network
[23:34:38] <relipse> right but US VPNS are subject ot US rules and government CIA and stuff
[23:34:52] <BadAdviceCat> Also useful for corporations, especially to scout out the competition ;)
[23:35:00] <relipse> law enforcement can still track you in a US vpn? am I right
[23:35:15] <znf> Any VPN providers are subject to their respective local laws and law enforcement agencies
[23:35:27] <relipse> so where do criminals go to find a vpn?
[23:35:31] <__adrian> "relipse> are VPNs subject to law enforcement?"  this question doesn't make sense
[23:35:41] <__adrian> what are you trying to figure out?
[23:35:53] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, asking for a friend? 😜
[23:36:05] <relipse> yes it does __adrian . Is your browsing history searchable by the federal government
[23:36:12] <ss23> lol
[23:36:19] <__adrian> ...
[23:36:24] <znf> VPNs aren't subject to "law enforcement", the providers of said services may me
[23:36:39] <__adrian> right, a VPN is not a person/"entity".
[23:36:46] <__adrian> the person using the VPN is
[23:36:56] <relipse> so what does a hacker or criminal need to do to get around it?
[23:36:57] <__adrian> does a VPN hide you? not really
[23:37:04] <relipse> find a VPN in a country that doesn't care about you?
[23:37:21] <znf> You're severely missinformed
[23:37:29] <__adrian> relipse: we're not here to help you figure out how to evade law enforcement
[23:37:33] <relipse> i'm here listening, you can explain it to me
[23:37:39] <relipse> _adrian i'm not asking for myself
[23:37:43] <relipse> but china for example
[23:37:48] <__adrian> that's great (and also not relevant)
[23:38:03] <relipse> their government bans bibles
[23:38:09] <__adrian> ?
[23:38:10] <__adrian> so?
[23:38:21] <znf> Did your tinfoil hat come off loose or something?
[23:38:23] <relipse> so ethical hacking would use a vpn to get around it
[23:38:35] <__adrian> this is not an ethical hacking channel
[23:38:41] <__adrian> also a VPN is not "hacking"
[23:38:49] <relipse> but hackers use VPN
[23:38:51] <relipse> am I wrong?
[23:38:51] <__adrian> it's an encrypted connection.
[23:38:59] <__adrian> MANY people use VPNs.
[23:39:05] <relipse> fi you don't want to talk about VPNS fine
[23:39:10] <judah> hackers also wear shoes
[23:39:14] <__adrian> NO, there is NOTHING innately malicious/illegal above a VPN.
[23:39:27] <znf> some even cut their hair and shave their beards *gasp*
[23:39:51] <znf> some wear skirts, because they like it
[23:39:56] <__adrian> if there's an underlying question (that doesn't have to do with breaking the law) (and does have to do with php) then please make it clear what you're asking
[23:40:18] <relipse> i know someone who might try to evade the law and I'm wondering what he might do to do that
[23:40:36] <znf> well, step 1 would be not to tell you he's doing that
[23:40:40] <__adrian> then your question is very off-topic and not something i'll allow here.
[23:41:28] <relipse> soo... who all has upgraded to 8.1?
[23:41:45] * relipse changes topic
[23:41:54] <znf> not many
[23:42:04] <judah> I have on my personal projects, loving it so far
[23:42:14] <judah> no complaints. its still PHP.
[23:42:32] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, you can't really hide. You can pretend, but it doesn't work that way. At least ONE other device on the internet knows where the origin (in this case, the hypothetical criminal) is connecting from. Despite what these VPN/proxy providers will tell you, their service may or may not have logging set up. They could have a way to monitor traffic. For example, just because their service has logging turned-off, that does not mean the traffic can
[23:42:33] <BadAdviceCat> not be monitored. Imagine a Giant-Flat-Screen Monitor that is installed inside the headquarters of a major VPN provider, logging is turned off, but access attempts are displayed on the monitor at all times. This activity is not saved/stored so for anyone to actually KNOW what happened, they will literally have to be stationed watching the monitor to see the activities. There are buttons/controls that allows one to filter which CUSTOMER USERNAME/Ip
[23:42:34] <BadAdviceCat> appears on the screen.
[23:43:07] <__adrian> BadAdviceCat: thanks, but we're changing the topic
[23:43:34] <__adrian> if anyone wants to know about what a vpn is/does/howitdoes, there's plenty of information online. just don't ask a vpn provider  ;)
[23:43:54] <relipse> i just want to catch a criminal
[23:43:55] <znf> "don't ask a vpn provider" is probably the best line I've heard in regards to VPNs :D
[23:44:13] <__adrian> relipse: then talk to law enforcement
[23:44:21] <relipse> done that already
[23:45:19] <judah> Im curious if anyone had any real issues with 8.1, or if its smooth sailing
[23:46:22] <__adrian> nothing i've seen/heard. keep an eye on bug reports. for the most part, bugs will be new bugs, not regressions
[23:47:07] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, should ask in DMs. Generally, my approach to problems like this as someone who wants to host a website is to just ban proxies/vpns. Use public blacklists, and something like cloudflare to filter out bad traffic, use recapcha/hCaptcha etc. This will not 100% stop proxies/vpns, but it helps. It can help reduce the attack vector of automated drive-by spammers.
[23:47:52] <znf> so I'm writing a plugin for cPanel, and I'm wondering, which one do you think looks better/simpler? https://i.imgur.com/UFpIuOf.png
[23:47:53] <__adrian> that's why i was asking for clarification, but they've made it pretty clear that that's not why they're asking
[23:48:20] <judah> znf, #3 definitely
[23:48:42] <znf> you think? I'm conflicted on that, it seems like it's a huge space waste
[23:54:39] *** Joins: delboy1978uk (~delboy197@d51A4773C.access.telenet.be)
[23:54:50] <relipse> BAC: dmed you
[23:55:15] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, Or you can go further and use imgur approach. Force phone number verification. https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028910652 - No phone, no account setup, period. This I imagine drastically reduce abuse very fast. Also, not only that, another approach is making the use of service PUBLIC/hard-to-hide. For example, if you are a image Hosting company: 1. Do not allow users to share/post pictures privately. 2. Make it impossible to
[23:55:16] <BadAdviceCat> send DMs. 3. If you want to, you can add to privacy policy that your website is not intended to be a secure messaging platform.
[23:55:19] <Sammitch> znf: #@ but put the labels on top
[23:55:22] <Sammitch> #2
[23:55:26] <BadAdviceCat> Okie dokie.
[23:56:00] <znf> Sammitch, not sure how I'd be able to put the label on top in bootstrap
[23:56:10] <znf> bootstrap3, that is
[23:56:49] <znf> (so no flex)
[23:57:53] <znf> unless I go .row > div.md-4 > label; then .row > div.md-4 > input
[23:58:09] <znf> not sure how that would look on mobile
[23:59:34] <Sammitch> do the evil thing
[23:59:36] <Sammitch> use a table
