[12:03:13] <Brekkjern> v.v.v
[12:03:14] <buttsbot> ( ‿|‿ ) ԅ(¯﹃¯ԅ)
[12:05:53] <Brekkjern> In what world is it convenient to type out ⍨?
[12:06:55] <Brekkjern> And why would you want to be able to type this incantation? A←{⍺⍺+⍵}⋄⎕←- A 5 6 7⋄0
[12:10:11] <imode> I dunno, some notation-as-a-tool-of-thought BS.
[12:10:48] <Brekkjern> I don't disagree that this is maybe how you think about the code, but it's the typing of it that I oppose
[12:11:18] <imode> someone wanted to write math notation and this was the compromise because the majority of mathematics notation is inconsistent.
[12:11:39] <imode> guy steele even had a talk or two about the level of inconsistency in computer science papers vis POPL.
[12:11:41] <Brekkjern> There are way too many esoteric charaacters there you don't find on a keyboard, which means you need to type out multi-character codes every time you need that symbol
[12:11:50] <Brekkjern> So why not just type a multi-character instruction instead?
[12:12:07] <imode> mathematicians are terse on chalk.
[12:12:17] <imode> and in naming things.
[12:12:23] <Brekkjern> Yes, but chalk and keyboards are two entirely different things
[12:12:40] <imode> yes. and you wonder why APL wasn't popular. :P
[12:12:51] <Brekkjern> Writing a squiggly = sign is trivial with chalk. It's annoying on a keyboard
[12:13:11] <imode> "why wouldn't you do this" --> a mathematician wanted to write in a (vaguely similar) language they understood.
[12:13:13] <imode> thus, APL.
[12:13:19] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[12:14:00] <Brekkjern> I get that. It just don't see why people then seriously discuss the language with arguments like "is likely to make this implementation unusable for non-trivial code"
[12:14:08] <imode> you don't think in that manner because you're not a mathematician. notation is often inconsistent because demonstrating an idea is trivial and/or isolated from the rest of your ideas.
[12:14:25] <imode> so instances of notation are disposable.
[12:14:49] <imode> and that's why APL is favored. because you can write short disposable snippets to coerce data in to the shape you want and do all sorts of ops on it.
[12:15:18] <imode> impressive. not maintainable or understandable in the long run.
[12:15:38] <Brekkjern> It will just take you fifty times as long to figure out how to type the characters/operands to write that code though :P
[12:15:47] <imode> FYI if you want an APL-but-regular-character-set, go look at J.
[12:15:53] <Brekkjern> Hmm
[12:15:54] <Brekkjern> No :P
[12:16:07] * imode shrugs.
[12:16:14] <imode> that wasn't to convince you or coerce you, just that it exists.
[12:16:17] <imode> and it's all ASCII.
[12:16:36] <Brekkjern> Eh
[12:16:57] <Brekkjern> It wasn't to blow you off either. It's just that I'm a programmer. Not a mathematician. LISP is annoying enough as it is.
[12:17:51] <imode> imo the "array language" is best suited as a DSL in your favorite programming language.
[12:18:25] <imode> feel free to store things as pairs of 1D arrays, one containing the "shape", one containing the data.
[12:18:37] <imode> and then write things out as regular ops.
[12:18:50] <imode> I did that. there was no noticable difference apart from more typing.
[12:41:49] <gthm> I played around with Lean a bit and thought they handled the arrays of weird symbols well: you can write either the LaTeX symbol or the unicode one, and the emacs mode for lean does s/LaTeX/unicode/ for you on the fly
[12:42:32] <gthm> but it's also literally for writing math, which comes with all this esoteric notational baggage in the first place

[16:28:51] <gwozniak> hahaha
[16:29:07] <pja> It is honestly ludicrous that in 2021, a bank is not storing people’s names as opaque UTF-8 encoded byte arrays.
[16:29:13] <gwozniak> Funny, I had to disconnect from the VPN to view that
[16:29:44] <pja> But hitting them with a GDPR lawsuit is perfect, because it gives the IT people internal leverage to update their tech stack.
[16:29:44] <gwozniak> pja: not touching working code is a powerful motivator
[16:30:44] <pja> Sure, but that way eventually lies madness. Like Credit Suisse having their own internal language that only they use that was created back in the 60s as the bastard offspring of SNOBOL & fortran (or something, I forget the details)
[16:31:02] <gwozniak> They'll probably just patch it in some horrible way
[16:31:26] <pja> So now they have to recruit people & train them up in it in order to get anything done. & who wants to get tied into a langauge that only qualifies you to work at a single bank?
[16:31:35] <gwozniak> It's well past the point of madness with those tech stacks

[16:36:53] <gwozniak> defect: my bank is similar.  I have written them about it a few times.  I think they got some form of 2FA on their mobile app (which I don't use) but apparently it's a mess

[17:30:06] <dimadima> amazing i didn't even parse that
[17:30:11] <gwozniak> I think my first install was on a Slackware CD in 1995, but I probably made floppies
[17:30:22] <gwozniak> I honestly can't remember now
[17:31:15] <dimadima> what do you mean the install was on a CD but you made floppies
[17:31:52] <dimadima> got a CD, but made floppies to boot?
[17:31:52] <gwozniak> I probably imaged some floppies or something from the CD. I don't know if it could be installed via CD at the time
[17:32:07] <dimadima> i remember downloading the floppies and imaging them
[17:32:15] <dimadima> it was probably 97, and i got some free 386 from somewhere
[17:32:53] <gwozniak> I just know that I installed Slackware around the end of 1995 or start of 1996.  I'm guessing it was from one of those Shareware CDs that were common at the time

[17:43:37] <gwozniak> it can

[17:44:16] <dimadima> lol
[17:44:43] <dimadima> well, less 'lol' and more 'scoff'
[17:44:57] <gerikson> man I still type 'apt-get' instead of 'apt'
[17:45:20] <dimadima> you can just type apt?
[17:45:27] <dimadima> `apt-get install` is what i do
[17:45:32] <dimadima> `apt-cache search` etc
[17:46:12] <gerikson> same

[17:47:18] <dimadima> had no idea you could just `apt` will have to look that up.

[17:53:46] <gwozniak> I don't even know Dune that well.  I hear the movie is a good movie, technically, but isn't all that much when it comes to characters
[17:54:06] <ngoldbaum> it’s a very literal adaptation of the first half of the novel
[17:54:08] <gwozniak> I'm going to try to see it in IMAX though
[17:54:17] <ngoldbaum> if you’ve read the novel you’ve basically seen it
[17:54:20] <ngoldbaum> pretty though
[17:54:30] <gwozniak> I've not read the novel
[17:54:34] <ngoldbaum> jason mamoa is a bad actor
[17:54:44] <gwozniak> I hear he's the most fun in the movie
[17:55:45] <ngoldbaum> yeah it’s pretty dour
[17:56:17] <ngoldbaum> visual language of star wars combined with the tone and look of arrival
[17:56:37] <gwozniak> I watched The Last Duel on the weekend and it was pretty good
[17:56:45] <riv> there is some connection with arrival isn't there?
[17:57:15] <gwozniak> Aside from the fact it's the same director?  Not that I've heard of
[17:58:12] <gerikson> I think in Lynch's Dune they truncated the Litany against fear?
[17:58:14] <gerikson> who cares
[17:58:25] <gerikson> slavish attention to fans is arguably a bad thing
[17:59:16] <gwozniak> Probably is
[17:59:43] <ngoldbaum> riv: the same director, the cinematographer did rogue one, has a kinda similar visual feel
[18:00:08] <riv> i noticed one of the actors from rogue one was in it
[18:00:13] <riv> I really enjoyed rogue one

[18:11:03] <deadk> sequels are bad
[18:11:06] <Brekkjern> The later books are interesting, but slow and tonally not at all similar to the first one
[18:11:08] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: none are as bad as the "prequels"
[18:11:44] <gerikson> there's a hella lot of interior monnologing
[18:11:47] <gerikson> and not much action
[18:11:47] <Brekkjern> Yep
[18:11:56] <Brekkjern> But that's more or less the same as the first book
[18:11:59] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: dune makes interesting commentary about tropes that were popular in sci-fi at the timr
[18:12:06] <gerikson> gonna take a long shot and ask if the kid wants to see it
[18:12:08] <ngoldbaum> messiah and children just kinda lean into them

[18:25:52] <Brekkjern> deadk: I saw the animation later. Thought that was good.
[18:25:54] <gerikson> I think it's better than the source manga

[20:00:39] <imode> I'm your host, imode, and today we'll be covering everyone's favorite topic: nightmares about work!
[20:01:29] <companion_cube> well, fuck
[20:01:30] <imode> for when you didn't get enough horse shit during the day, now your mind can extrapolate on the wonders of the workplace, and turn your boss from the regular human being they probably are into a nightmareish big brother overwatch that quizzes you on the word "symbol" during a stand up in front of your peers!
[20:02:22] <imode> our lucky contestant today is none other than... imode! he's just come off of a semi-normal weekend, a rarity around his parts! this dude just seems to refuse to die!
[20:03:09] <imode> tell us, imode, why are you back in the saddle for another routine pounding by nameless, faceless customers that you'll never interact with once you're PIP'd and given severance?
[20:03:16] <imode> "it's a living."
[20:03:40] <indigo> Wait, did you get PIP'd?
[20:04:24] <imode> not yet, but I was reassured on friday that they always give out "hush money" if you fall that far.
[20:05:41] <imode> thankfully this week might be a reprieve from the last but I still had nightmares about work. great setup for a monday where you have to interact with everyone.
[20:06:22] <riv> it sucks when you have dreams/nightmares about shit like that
[20:06:51] <riv> I still have bad dreams from stuff that's not been an issue for almost year
[20:07:14] <riv> can you not just dream something relaxing, come on brain
[20:31:19] <dimadima> it's 79 and sunny here today
[20:31:22] <dimadima> hello imode!
[20:32:54] <imode> hey dimadima.
[20:32:58] <imode> how goes things.
[20:34:54] <indigo> Nice and rainy today in LA
[20:45:36] <dimadima> pretty good, pretty good. covid test came back this morning--negative. which is good and bad, because the symptoms were so mild, i was hoping maybe it was covid. but how we could have caught covid, with our child playing on the playground, was unclear, and PCR confirmed that
[20:46:33] <dimadima> but today marks probably a straight week of the child waking up at 6:30am, which is rough. could be worse, but he used to wake up at around 7:30-8.
[20:46:50] <dimadima> on thing i learned from having this child is that everything hinges on his shits
[20:47:09] <dimadima> and in addition to having his first cold, he's also been pretty badly constipated
[20:47:31] <dimadima> but just put him down to nap so will hopefully work in peace for a while
[20:47:56] <companion_cube> he's 17 months, right?
[20:48:37] <dimadima> found a pretty nice twitter audience in terms of conversions: a group i dubbed "neo-liberal hipsters", though in reality it seems to be impressing on people who are also socialist hipsters and also just hipsters
[20:48:50] <dimadima> companion_cube: 18, if we're counting
[20:48:59] <dimadima> but yeah, that range
[20:49:03] <companion_cube> heh
[20:49:42] <dimadima> kept him un-infected for quite a while. covid helped with that. but he started getting so shy and skittish that we decided it was irresponsible to keep him from people any longer
[20:50:24] <dimadima> though some people claimed it didn't matter, you can always just socialize a person later, like when they're 3 or 4; but i'm not sure that worked well for me :)
[20:50:46] <dimadima> that's my story
[20:51:05] <dimadima> imode what does one even say when quizzed what a "symbol" is?
[20:51:25] <dimadima> i would say a symbol is a name pointing some memory allocated on the stack
[20:51:34] <dimadima> on the current frame, perhaps
[20:51:37] <dimadima> why would that even come up
[20:53:00] <indigo> My wife is sick as well, also a negative covid test. It's probably the microchips in the vaccine acting up again
[20:53:17] <indigo> I hope your son gets better dimadima
[20:53:30] <dimadima> yeah they're supposed to kill you in like 3 years i learned when i did my research
[20:53:41] <indigo> Right, always do your own research
[20:53:48] <indigo> It's amazing how much information Facebook has
[20:53:55] <dimadima> yeah he's fine. for a first symptomatic infection this has been super chill
[20:53:59] <dimadima> so much information!
[20:54:30] <dimadima> information has truly been democratized
[20:54:51] <dimadima> how's your wife doing? mine was less sick than me at first but now i've recovered and she's still a bit out of it
[21:00:06] <imode> super happy about the negative test.. this disease has the apparent ability to cause permanent brain damage.
[21:04:45] <hoistbypetard> dimadima: good luck! i'm so glad both of my kids are old enough to answer questions about how they're feeling. even with that, our first round of head colds (last month) since the pandemic started was extra-stressful. we got to enjoy the added wrinkle of an ambiguous antigen test causing some extra reporting/scrambling at first :)
[21:04:57] <dimadima> i would say i would be in an extremely covid-conservative cohort were it not for my conflicting paternal sense of obligation to socialize my child before it's too late
[21:05:02] <indigo> dimadima: Decent so far. Hopefully she takes a sick day today
[21:06:42] <hoistbypetard> i am also in an extremely covid-conservative cohort. my compromise is that socializing for these little unvaccinated people takes place outdoors whenever i get any influence over the matter.
[21:06:45] <dimadima> hoistbypetard: thanks a lot. i just wish there was some way to get him to blow his nose... we do the nose frida but sometimes he gets so pissed off that it doesn't seem worth it. he seems mostly over it. i'm really looking forward to him being able to tell us stuff. the other day we were pretty sure he communicated hunger to us, and that was pretty aweomse
[21:08:01] <dimadima> yeah we let him play indoors with vaccinated parent groups during the pre-delta lul but it's all outdoors now
[21:08:51] <dimadima> not sure what we'll do in the winter but whatever, we'll figure it out :). it's nice we have a good PCR testing site nearby that reports in about 24 hours
[21:09:27] <dimadima> hoistbypetard: congrats again though on have two kids who are able to communicate with you. that's awesome.
[21:09:37] <dimadima> like not by screaming
[21:09:43] <hoistbypetard> wow. that's quick. we were 48-72, with it falling closer to 72
[21:09:47] <hoistbypetard> :)
[21:09:58] <hoistbypetard> sometimes they still scream, but less and less :D
[21:10:32] <dimadima> my guy was the chillest and now screams or wails like all freaking day
[21:10:42] <dimadima> hehehe
[21:11:00] <companion_cube> I'd be conservative but my kid goes to daycare
[21:11:06] <companion_cube> so, she's got germs!
[21:12:04] <imode> gotta build that immune system up.
[21:12:10] <dimadima> that probably sucks near-term but long-term it's got to be agood investment. my mom, specifically, is a neurotic germophobe so iwas literally unsocialized until kindergarten, and i got really bad colds and flu well into my 20s
[21:12:36] <companion_cube> gotta have time to work during the day, too
[21:12:40] <dimadima> yeah
[21:12:56] <hoistbypetard> those daycare germs lead to kids who don't miss many days of kindergarten and first grade :)
[21:13:54] <dimadima> i'd say my immune system caught up way later than kindergraten or first grade
[21:14:01] <dimadima> i started eating shit off the floor, not washing my hands, etc
[21:14:07] <dimadima> it helped i really think so
[21:14:15] <dimadima> allergies got better too
[21:15:01] <dimadima> (eating shit off the floor and, you know, "5 second rule" :))
[21:16:28] <hoistbypetard> i enforce a modified 5 second rule with mine... they can eat it if it's less than 5ish seconds, the dog hasn't gotten it, *and* there's not a bunch of dog hair stuck to it
[21:16:49] <hoistbypetard> the last clause spoils the deal as often as not
[21:21:16] <dimadima> yeah floor hair is pretty strong grounds for 5 second rule disqualification
[21:22:55] <dimadima> often wish i had a dog! would be nice
[21:26:41] <companion_cube> get a angora cat
[21:26:47] <companion_cube> if you want heir

[21:51:58] <prussian> 20 hours, no 3 hours, no it's actually 8 hours
[21:52:02] <dimadima> well, i was tryng not to argue, but he kept insisting it can and should be fixed
[21:52:26] <prussian> speaking of progress bars lmao
[21:52:27] <dimadima> make progress bars great again
[21:52:38] <gwozniak> I'm fine with progress bars and/or a percentage count. Just don't bother with the time estimates
[21:52:39] <prussian> I broke the living hell out of one at work
[21:53:06] <dimadima> gwozniak: he insisted it was possible to calculate the time and people just weren't doing it right or something...
[21:53:13] <companion_cube> that's why JS projects are the best maintained ones
[21:53:20] <companion_cube> dependabot ensures there's a PR every week
[21:53:20] <prussian> it use to use weird GNU Tar features to periodically call a binary that set some text file of the "progress" and I just removed it because it seemed moronic, so now it will be stuck at 98% done for like 10 minutes.
[21:53:57] <prussian> of course complaints were had, but the old behavior was just as useless, if not slower.
[21:54:25] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: sealed updates on macos are supposedly a security win but they’re also a massive timewaster
[21:54:49] <prussian> it's not done til it's done.
[21:54:51] <prussian> simple as that.

[21:58:39] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Don't updates on macOS append to a merkle tree?
[21:58:57] <ngoldbaum> yeah something like that
[21:59:15] <indigo> It's amusing to me that macOS updates used to be way faster than Windows updates, and now it's the other way around
[21:59:18] <ngoldbaum> it’s why updates take like an hour to run

[21:59:35] <ngoldbaum> lol lambda school
[22:08:08] <indigo> Oh, bootcamps
[22:14:29] <indigo> > The school recently sent him a letter demanding his banking information so that it could track direct deposits from a job. If he doesn't comply, it threatened to charge him his full tuition of $30,000 regardless of whether he gets a job.
[22:14:41] <indigo> Wooow
[22:19:17] <gwozniak> uh... wut
[22:20:50] <prussian> lol
[22:20:58] <prussian> the future.
[22:23:25] <pja> lambda sounds great until you actually look into it & then it turns out that it’s another SV shitshow.
[22:23:30] <prussian> my current boss was a bootcamper.
[22:23:35] <prussian> I guess it works for some people.
[22:25:19] <pja> NB. Saw ⊃∪∩∊. It was ... very Dune actually.
[22:34:14] <Brekkjern> Indeed it was :P
[22:37:23] <ngoldbaum> it was definitely a motion picture
[22:42:21] <gwozniak> I got a desk riser a couple of months ago and I'm really appreciating it of late
[22:50:43] <indigo> Nice! I was thinking of getting a monitor arm
[22:52:00] <gwozniak> Sometimes I just stand for 20 or 30 minutes, but it makes a difference
[22:53:08] <riv> i would love to have that
[22:54:20] <gwozniak> I had a standing desk from Ikea that didn't work very well so I didn't use it.  I find the riser to be more convenient
[22:55:16] <riv> i think it's too much to stand all day, but being able to stand sometimes sounds perfect
[22:58:45] <dimadima> my ikea standing desk is nice

[22:58:53] <gwozniak> I will say that a standing desk is more stable than the riser I have (a Flexispot model).  But the riser is more than adequate
[23:00:06] <dimadima> now i'm wondering if i should dislike my ikea standing desk. is there someone bad about it that i am missing
[23:01:19] <gwozniak> Mine just stopped working
[23:01:26] <gwozniak> As in the motor died
[23:01:58] <gwozniak> I found it inconvenient to raise/lower anyway, so I didn't worry about replacing it
[23:02:20] <gwozniak> If you're happy with yours, then don't let me dissuade you :)
[23:03:20] <dimadima> i hate it now
[23:03:42] <dimadima> :)))
[23:04:01] <dimadima> the motor apparently has a 10 yr warranty!
[23:04:19] <dimadima> but the bullshit uncool trick ikea plays is they _require_ you to have a receipt to collect any warranty
