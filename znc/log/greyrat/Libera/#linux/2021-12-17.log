[03:46:51] <uwharrie> if there's some process on one side or the other changing one of the files' contents or metadata, rsync will ensure they match (depending on the specific rsync arguments used)
[03:47:54] <Ellipsis753> You could _try_ "--modify-window=2" on rsync. This can help when the filesystems have differing timestamp resolution.

[04:12:51] <phogg> I notice that your timestamps are not equal on both sides, which means times were not preserved. If rsync is comparing size+mtime to determine "different" then perhaps it syncs anyway. From what -u is documented as doing it seems like a newer timestamp is, by default, treated as a difference, but -u makes it not count as different.

[04:13:33] <phogg> so that's weird

[09:37:27] <bocaneri> jason1234, that question didn't parse.
[09:38:07] <EdFletcher> i _think_ they want to allow all users to read the `dmesg` buffer without giving them any elevated permissions -- afaik, that isn't possible because the `dmesg` buffer is in the kernel, so you must be root to access it

[09:40:45] <EdFletcher> jason1234: yeah i suppose you could recompile the kernel to allow that, but it's likely not as simple as _just_ recompiling, you may need to actually make code changes. seems like a lot of work for something that likely isn't needed. _why_ do regular users all need access to dmesg? they can't act on most messages in it anyway without root

[10:44:27] <jensen> I followed https://www.weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#irc_sasl_authentication, using ecdsa-nist256p-challenge running the exact same commands. I don't recall any errors after setting the pub key when I was logged in. I configured SASL options for the server as stated, then experience the errors following /reconnect libera
[10:45:21] <jensen> The last command before /reconnect libera was `/set irc.server.libera.sasl_key "${weechat_config_dir}/ecdsa.pem"` as stated in the guide. I wasn't sure if I should literally use the bracket variable or replace with `~/.config/weechat`, if it even reads the tilde correctly
[10:45:32] <sheep> did you add your key to nickserv?
[10:45:58] <jensen> yes, I don't recall `/msg nickserv set pubkey <my key>` reporting errors

[12:28:59] <bocaneri> I'd suggest looking at dmesg to see if you can spot something related to that error. From here, I can't tell exactly where in the boot process "before login" that error might occur.
[12:29:26] <bocaneri> It means exactly what it said: something tried to write to or read from sectors outside the hard drive's "physical" space.

[14:10:06] <ProfessorChunk> They use PCI lanes they are not referred to as PCIe usually unless using an actual PCIe board. U.2 or M.2 is what they are usually referred to, the connector types.

[19:25:49] <Minus_One> Xeroine, if you are using atime mount option it will have to write for the access time at least. Otherwise, maybe an ssd controller will optimize away writing identical data over itself. Or possibly other optimizations somewhere might do the same, I guess.

[19:26:37] <ayecee> you don't need sync. there's an implicit sync on file close, as when the echo terminates.

[20:39:58] <tseug> TomyWork tar files are actually bad at being rsync'd without special arguments to tar IIRC.  Rsync actually uses sizes (--block-size argument) the default i believe is the square root of the size of the file.
[20:40:03] <Guest00> Is there a rate limiting tool/command I can use to test my localhost web development?
[20:40:17] <Guest00> I want to overload my localhost if possible
[20:40:22] <ayecee> what do you want to limit the rate of
[20:40:37] <[[R]]> and if you want to overload it, then why do you want to limit it
[20:40:49] <xx> rttncw: yes, they can access your shares if you don't block it on the firewall
[20:41:00] <xx> or configure samba to only listen on a specific interface
[20:41:03] <Guest00> my website because other attackers will try to overload it one day i am sure
[20:41:04] <TomyWork> rttncw, if your ports are open, then yes, your ports are open
[20:41:08] <tseug> RSYNC works best i think, for things like text files. Database files that tend to be large, (TB in size) rsync tends to go slow.

[20:43:33] <ayecee> Guest00: there's probably a way to rate limit each of those, but not a tool that does all of those

[20:44:28] <tseug> TomyWork I mean, I have seen RSYNC take 2-3 times longer to run when the target has a copy of the file on something over 1 TB in size, when the initial transfer was maybe 9 hours, it could end up at 2-3 days. and these aren't super fast links, but they aren't like Kbps links. so it really depends on the type of file, and how the data changes, as
[20:44:29] <tseug> well as your actual link speed.

[21:42:05] <tseug> [[R]] thanks for the thought on the symlink idea. it may work if i can't find another alternative
[21:42:18] <luva> the issue isnt really reproducable though since it works also on my current distro, but then suddenly stops working after a few hours, so its not easy to test
[21:42:24] <luva> anyway, thanks for help.
