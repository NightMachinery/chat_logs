[00:40:10] <ada_> Tach: run a container that does nothing, and mount your script as a file

[00:40:46] <ada_> or, supply the script as teh "command" to the container, and just run it and let it exit
[00:40:58] <Tach> ada_ okay, why a seperate container for that ?
[00:40:58] <ada_> docker run -v /path/to/script.sh:/bin/script.sh ubuntu /bin/script.sh
[00:41:07] <ada_> I don't understand the question
[00:41:44] <Tach> I understood that something like docker exec (-it) containername /bin/bash < ./localscript.sh should do as well ?
[00:41:56] <ada_> docker exec command must be run against a container thats already running
[00:42:15] <ada_> your problem doesn't require 'exec' to solve
[00:42:21] <Tach> yes it is already running
[00:42:38] <ada_> if it's already running, but the script isn't in the container, then you could use `docker cp` to copy the script into the container
[00:42:40] <ada_> then you could exec it
[00:42:57] <Tach> so the script needs to be in the container at any time ?
[00:43:03] <ada_> the container has its own filesystem
[00:43:09] <ada_> it can only access the files inside the container
[00:43:23] <ada_> so: either run a new container and mount the script, or copy the script into the container with docker cp
[00:44:03] <Tach> okay
[00:44:42] <Tach> in that case using arguments is nothing useful as well, I can better use the environment variables

[00:58:41] <devslash> I wrote a Dockerfile a while ago and I rewrote it using multi layer builds. This is the original Dockerfile which produces a 817MB image : https://termbin.com/pbef This is the rewritten Dockerfile which produces a 1.03 GB image: https://termbin.com/qgg6 I expected the multi layer Dockerfile to be much smaller. Am I doing something wrong ? 
[01:00:53] <programmerq> devslash that just looks like the same dockerfile but with a bunch of steps collapsed into one RUN command. That's not a multistage Dockerfile.
[01:01:28] <devslash> did you see the copy command
[01:01:35] <devslash> at the end of the 2nd script
[01:01:49] <devslash> Isnt that supposed to copy everything I need into another layer
[01:02:18] <ada_> you only have 1 FROM so it's only 1 stage
[01:02:37] <devslash> tthen how do I fix this ?
[01:02:38] <ada_> you'd need another FROM before that final COPY to create a second stage
[01:02:45] <programmerq> yeah, COPY --from <current stage> is the same as just doing COPY
[01:02:48] <devslash> whats the syntax for that 
[01:03:01] <ada_> what do you mean
[01:03:11] <ada_> you already have the syntax correct in your first stage
[01:03:12] <devslash> the article that I found online doesnt say that you need to do that
[01:03:13] <ada_> add a second stage
[01:03:24] <devslash> what I am trying to do is reduce the size of my image
[01:03:35] <ada_> FROM foo as base ... <do stuff>. FROM foo as final, COPY --from base ...
[01:03:43] <ada_> I get it, you just have everything you need already
[01:03:54] <ada_> the syntax to create another stage is the same as what you used to set up "intermediate" 
[01:04:14] <devslash> so does that 2nd FROM go right before the COPY
[01:04:15] <ada_> FROM <image> as <stage> && COPY --from <earlier-stage> ...
[01:04:35] <ada_> pseudocode ^
[01:04:56] <devslash> do I reference the same image the 2nd itme
[01:05:05] <devslash> which is php:7.4-apache
[01:05:53] <devslash> FROM php:7.4-apache as final && COPY --from=intermediate
[01:05:56] <devslash> is that correct
[01:06:18] <ada_> you can't literally use the &&s
[01:06:33] <ada_> the only thing you have to do is add a FROM php before your COPY line
[01:06:37] <devslash> oh ok
[01:06:57] <ada_> you don't even need to give the final image a stage name, because there are no stages after it
[01:07:02] <ada_> final stage*/
[01:07:24] <ada_> you could use a different image if you wanted, but it looks like you probably want php:7.4 given the use case
[01:07:34] <devslash> yes
[01:07:49] <devslash> I just dont want any extra cruft that I dont need in the image
[01:08:33] <programmerq> all those apt packages wouldn't be copied over with that COPY command, which may or may not be what you want. Normally with a multistage, you'd have the earlier stage install build time dependencies, and the final stage would only need runtime dependencies.

[02:30:37] <tabakhase> Tach the init.sql is even "after that" mostly ---  very usefull to bindmount dumps into it when you have the usecase of "give me this dump as useable db for research" rather than "to create your production schema"  (what ideally your app should manage with migrations)

[02:34:24] <tabakhase> devslash yea so of that 400mb, its only 3.76MB YOU actually added -- so to cut anything down there at all your baseimage is at fault... if its such a concern, maybe try the php:*-alpine images
[02:34:56] <devslash> does that include apache?

[02:37:29] <devslash> so I would use that image for the 2nd from only right ?

[05:00:30] <ada_> you'd have to loop over all the network names and inspect each and get all the JSON and then index it and select the ones where size of .Containers is >1 maybe
[05:01:36] <Tach> I have found a way with jq but I get json back again
[05:01:51] <ada_> json has ways to print regular text
[05:03:41] <Tach> but does jq ?
[05:03:47] <ada_> i meant jq
[05:06:38] <Tach> ok I will try to find some examples
[05:06:42] <Tach> thanks a lot

[07:57:37] <devslash> this is my dockerfile https://termbin.com/dcosf The last 2 lines FROM and COPY are causing the container to restart. Docker logs shows "No package "sqlite3" found" if I comment out the FROM and COPY line at the end of the script it builds and runs fine. 
[08:11:08] <tabakhase> devslash what did you expect...? :D
[08:11:24] <tabakhase> and that should be fairly selfexplained or not...
[08:13:07] <tabakhase> as in, copying /var/www/html certainly gives no fudge about /lib, /usr and whatanot 
[08:16:32] <devslash> so what should i copy

[08:23:24] <tabakhase> everything you need ;-) -- and if wget is the only thing you dont... its prob not worth a multistage anyhow (as i had mentioned a while ago, php-multistage smells kinda wrong, its more a thing for languages that compile...)
[08:24:02] <tabakhase> cause, then you a) dont need the compiler and b) dont need the sourcecode in the result, so lots of space to save
[08:24:21] <tabakhase> but runtime-dependencies or interpretted-code, nothing to win...
[08:26:57] <devslash> i removed the multi build part by commenting out FROM and COPY at the end and optimized the run and its 1GB
[08:29:51] <tabakhase> what smells about right given youre throwing in  sqlite3 ffmpeg libsqlite3-dev python python3 python3-distutils tzdata unzip vim wget gpg msodbcsql17 mssql-tools unixodbc-dev and some php-extensions yea...
[08:31:32] <tabakhase> see what of that you _actually_ need - python got nothing todo there, unless your php expects to exec that i guess - same with ffmpeg - and for db you prob. only need the driver you intend to use, if thats sqlite, rip the mssql stuff
[08:31:45] <devslash> i use php in my application
[08:32:00] <devslash> err aorry
[08:32:11] <devslash> I mean Python to do audio fingerprinting
[08:32:29] <devslash> have you ever heard of youtube-dl ?
[08:34:08] <tabakhase> https://github.com/wernight/docker-youtube-dl/blob/master/Dockerfile 40mb on the hub https://hub.docker.com/r/wernight/youtube-dl
[08:34:19] <tabakhase> https://github.com/mikenye/docker-youtube-dl 250mb on the hub https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/youtube-dl
[08:34:22] <devslash> thats not why I was asking
[08:38:13] <devslash> I was wondering if you are familiar with it because my application is an image that is a web based UI for youtube-dl. It uses Python to do audio fingerprinting to identify the track. SQL Server to get some setting related data. ffmpeg is used by youtube-dl. I use sqlite3 as a really simple DB to store download progress so the app can show the DL progress
[08:39:26] <devslash> all of the packages that get installed are used by one of the applications
[08:42:38] <tabakhase> > see what of that you _actually_ need < - if your answer is actually all of it, then thats what it is yea
[08:43:22] <tabakhase> not rly anything one can do about it
[08:45:49] <tabakhase> kinda "best" you can do then is to make sure your layers are in an order & setup where you get the most reuse possible from it
[08:46:32] <tabakhase> this wont make it any smaller, but having to upload 600mb of dependencies just once a month rather than "getting it trashed on every build cause the COPY step before it" is still worth a lot
[08:52:48] <devslash> yea i did that...
