[06:46:56] <amigojapan> Japan lives demiglace sauce
[06:47:20] <DunceCotus> demiglace?
[06:47:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's a dark sauce used in many French dishes
[06:48:27] <DunceCotus> "Demi-glace is a rich brown sauce in French cuisine used by itself or as a base for other sauces. The term comes from the French word glace, which, when used in reference to a sauce, means "icing" or "glaze." It is traditionally made by combining one part Espagnole sauce and one part brown stock. "
[06:48:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Like most fancy French cooking, it's probably overcomplicated.
[06:49:07] <DunceCotus> all I know is French know how to make food look fancy
[06:49:12] <DunceCotus> but not sure about the taste
[06:49:44] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah
[06:49:56] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I hate demiglace, even tho it is used in fancy food
[06:50:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I mean if you drizzle sauce on a dish you're gonna disappoint/annoy/turn-off some people
[06:51:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: lets say you like demiglace
[06:51:23] <DunceCotus> then you would be counting your blessings its on every fancy food
[06:52:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: for Japanese omelettes there are two versions, the cheap ketchup version and the expresive demiglace version, I love the ketchup version

[09:36:47] <TsundereNoises> jessedesu_onaph: 2 AM is not a good time for coffee, but it's what I want

[09:39:26] <KatrinValerie> but idk
[09:39:38] <KatrinValerie> Never watched the original gundam
[09:39:50] <jessedesu_onaph> There's so many spinoffs sequels ova and what have you
[09:39:50] <TsundereNoises> a lot of them are pretty independent of each other, I think most are, even in the same "timeline"
[09:39:57] <TsundereNoises> but I haven't seen THAT many gundam shows
[09:40:12] <jessedesu_onaph> This is a question for redphoenix

[10:18:58] <amigojapan> Hey omero 
[10:19:04] <omero> hey amigojapan ;)
[10:19:28] <amigojapan> omero: I had a non first world problem yesterday
[10:19:43] <omero> the kite?
[10:20:18] <MootPoot> ohhhhhhhhhhhh shit
[10:20:20] <MootPoot> pog
[10:20:28] <amigojapan> omero: a kite (a bird like a hawk but much bigger) attacked me on the beach. I have a cut close to my eye
[10:20:34] <omero> I wonder what were you doing to attract such attention, amigojapan 
[10:20:36] <MootPoot> my uni just updated their free software for student section
[10:20:40] <amigojapan> Oh yeah omero that
[10:20:44] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I do not have the numbers, I don't remember what the project was called that sent out focused radio messages to certain places
[10:20:46] <MootPoot> got a free win11 and a win server 2022 key
[10:20:47] <MootPoot> pog
[10:21:00] <amigojapan> omero: I was carrying food
[10:21:02] <KatrinValerie> it wasn't seti, they are only listening for radio signals
[10:21:22] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: seti
[10:21:23] <KatrinValerie> or was that radio pulse thing just proposed and never actually done
[10:21:53] <KatrinValerie> anyways, if other civilisations did things like that, we should see signs
[10:22:08] <KatrinValerie> at the very least we can conclude that civilisations have not reached out for the stars
[10:22:10] <amigojapan> omero: I am glad they attacked me and not my wife

[10:25:34] <omero> problem: what you aim the beam at?

[10:29:43] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: I don't know why I'm not asleep though
[10:29:44] <TsundereNoises> I should be
[10:30:11] <omero> amigojapan: I have no idea of what "first world problems" refers to
[10:30:29] <KatrinValerie> If only I knew whether my banking app will still work on LineageOS
[10:30:38] <TsundereNoises> omero: meaning ladies rather than raptors when you say you were attacked by a bird
[10:30:39] <KatrinValerie> I should really update my Pixel
[10:31:08] <amigojapan> omero: first world problems are minor problems rich people suffer and complain about when they live a privileged life
[10:32:00] <omero> thus, let me get this straight amigojapan : you had food with you and kite attacked?
[10:32:07] <amigojapan> omero: non serious problems that people complain about
[10:32:33] <amigojapan> Yes omero , that is not a first world problem
[10:32:54] <omero> its rather unusual in all cases
[10:33:20] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: often it is also used to down talk the complaints of the lower classes
[10:33:27] <omero> you were probably seen as a menace
[10:33:30] <KatrinValerie> it's worse elsewhere is basically the argument
[10:34:08] <KatrinValerie> but in reality relative inequality is often a driving force of human misery
[10:34:12] <amigojapan> omero: several kites swormed above us. So I think they were going to attack in a swarm.i quickly threw the food away from us and one kite took it away
[10:34:14] <omero> what were you wearing, amigojapan ?
[10:34:36] <KatrinValerie> When you are poor it is extremely hard to climb out of that, because being poor is expensive.
[10:34:42] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: really...I thought it was for upper classes
[10:34:59] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: I feel like you're misrepresenting how it's most often used
[10:35:00] <TsundereNoises> yeah
[10:35:14] <amigojapan> omero: grey shirt and blue swim pants
[10:35:17] <KatrinValerie> It is often used for the highly privileged
[10:35:35] <KatrinValerie> but they turn it around on those that started it
[10:35:57] <TsundereNoises> Karens often complain about first world problems

[10:36:21] *** Joins: zaara (~erza@140.213.5.49)
[10:36:21] <KatrinValerie> Well Germany is a welfare state, so we have regular discussions about whether people who don't work should eat
[10:36:35] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: at least it's a discussion
[10:37:01] <KatrinValerie> And often times it boils down to yeah well you can still afford food you can survive of off
[10:37:03] <TsundereNoises> like a significant amount of people think that people have a right to food there and aren't just stealing if they get help
[10:37:05] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: how about people that can't work?
[10:37:30] <KatrinValerie> heck it is even possible to overeat and become fat on gov money, but that's only because junk food is cheaper than more healthy alternatives
[10:37:54] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: there's always people that want those to just disappear
[10:38:01] <TsundereNoises> anyway, "first world problems" usually gets used for "they never put enough foam in my latte" type problems
[10:38:11] <TsundereNoises> not like legitimate policy problems of first world countries
[10:38:14] <KatrinValerie> even if it's "just a minority"
[10:38:31] <KatrinValerie> I feel like we are not doing enough about anti-democratic extremism in Germany
[10:38:41] <omero> Im out of this, since it leads nowhere
[10:38:55] <TsundereNoises> omero: true, but I just need to un-confuse things
[10:38:56] <KatrinValerie> well and the constant surfacing of more scandals around police and connects to far right organisations
[10:38:57] <TsundereNoises> I should sleep
[10:39:21] <amigojapan> Gn TsundereNoises 
[10:39:23] <KatrinValerie> It is well known that the NSU could not have operated like they did without the help of cops
[10:39:33] <KatrinValerie> but there was never any serious investigation around that
[10:39:45] <KatrinValerie> then we have nazi cops stealing and stashing ammunition
[10:39:47] <TsundereNoises> on one hand I want to make fun of how all these are just USA problems that aren't as bad, but Europe really kind of loves fascism so it's not good to make light of it
[10:40:03] <KatrinValerie> I feel like we might be on the verge of a fascist coup
[10:40:22] <KatrinValerie> And they are going to use the center left government as an argument to start it
[10:41:18] <KatrinValerie> Big media outlets that are connect to the far right have been pushing this myth that our politics shifted too far to the left and our economy is going to suffer as a result.
[10:41:40] <TsundereNoises> I'm still waiting on that hyperinflation
[10:41:46] <KatrinValerie> When in reality even the so called social democratic party did more neoliberal politics
[10:42:13] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: hedge your money in stonks and resources
[10:42:14] <omero> if we discuss gundam ... Im fine
[10:42:21] <KatrinValerie> if you have enough
[10:42:31] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: I don't have enough money to worry about, but also I'm being sarcastic
[10:42:44] <omero> I can even discuss ecchi or hentai anime
[10:42:46] <KatrinValerie> no srsly as long as capitalism doesn't fall it is sensible to do capital investment
[10:42:51] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: right wing people were pushing this idea that biden would be instant hyper-inflation
[10:42:56] <KatrinValerie> and if it does, it don't matter anyways
[10:43:03] <omero> but politics? religions? not a chance.
[10:43:18] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: Meow meow and lefties really thought he was a progressive
[10:43:18] <amigojapan> omero: did you watch haruhi?
[10:43:39] <KatrinValerie> When in reality the dems are moving to the right in order to try and mend their relationship with the reps
[10:43:40] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: bull. shit. we were all disappointed preemptively
[10:43:53] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: probably
[10:44:07] <KatrinValerie> I mean, anyone who'd pick up that mess would have a tough time
[10:44:10] <omero> doesnt sound familiar, amigojapan ... thus not likely I watched
[10:44:23] <KatrinValerie> but still, the reps showed that you can push certain things against the opposition
[10:44:31] <KatrinValerie> The dems simply do not want to do that
[10:44:31] <TsundereNoises> Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an absolute classic
[10:44:39] <KatrinValerie> and do a decree government like Trump did
[10:44:49] <KatrinValerie> Because they consider that shameful
[10:44:51] <omero> TsundereNoises, amigojapan : noted
[10:44:54] <amigojapan> omero: it's a kind of modern anime(for my age) that I liked
[10:45:04] <KatrinValerie> Well, a lot of actors in politics are just that, actors who are only in for the money.
[10:45:06] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: I half agree with you and half want to explain why you're takling out your ass but omero doesn't want to talk about politics and I should have been asleep 3 hours ago so another day?
[10:45:10] <omero> will investigate
[10:45:21] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: sure thing
[10:45:37] <KatrinValerie> And I am always talking out of my ass when it comes to politics, at least to an extent.
[10:45:38] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: I'm very passionate about US politics (i.e. I've been mostly angry my whole life)
[10:45:48] <KatrinValerie> The rise of fascism in Europe is worrying though and real
[10:46:30] <omero> TsundereNoises: lol... now it is not that me disliking politics talk should discourage further discussions... I appreciate the thought that its being my fault ;)
[10:46:38] <TsundereNoises> yes, I was serious that one one hand I want to make fun of the comparissons to the US lately, but also you guys just really love big daddy fascism to a worrying degree
[10:46:54] <TsundereNoises> omero: it's too late, I've already blamed you
[10:47:02] <KatrinValerie> The UK look really bad, the BBC is pushing a massive hate campeign against trans people and is cooperating with organisations that have ties to right-wing groups
[10:47:16] <KatrinValerie> It is really scary

[10:48:43] <TsundereNoises> don't get sick
[10:48:55] <omero> I have been told evangelion is good...

[10:49:19] <TsundereNoises> omero: NGE is good (I think it's overrated but it's solid) but it's not a religious anime, just yeah religious symbolism
[10:49:32] <TsundereNoises> and anime use of christian imagery is always kind of funny
[10:49:45] <amigojapan> omero: it's probably the best anime of all times

I said I want Windows 10, they started arguing about how you can play games on Linux. I repeated that I want Windows 10 and would appreciate help in my question. They now started arguing with each other on the best UNIX and then which is best for games. Then they were suddenly 
[12:38:51] <Cryowolf> talking about running NAS servers and whatnot and started suggesting Linux for  NAS and whatever to me even if I never asked for it.

[14:04:44] <duds-> The following redpill is gonna be hard for you to swallow. I invite you to watch the movie Manbiki Kazoku (Shoplifters) for a realistic impression of everyday Japanese life. Japan isn't clean, sparkly and odor-neutral like in your animes. The Japanese live like cattle on a farm, cramped into tiny one-room "apartments" that are filled to the brim with trash. The only reason you don't notice how dirty it is is because there's not enough room on the 
[14:04:44] <duds-> floor for piles of dirt and dust to form. They come home from shopping at a konbini and sit down at their floor-table thing without even washing their hands. They sleep in futons which they never wash (too big for a washing machine), they simply "air them out" every now and then. Yes, that's right, they sleep in their own fermented sweat and maybe piss until they buy a new futon. The summers in Japan are very hot and humid, yet the Japanese don't 
[14:04:45] <duds-> shower after getting home. They wipe their sweat into the furniture (which they never clean) and take turns in bathing in the same bathwater later at night. They slurp their ramen noodles for banmeshi and spill thick drops of grease everywhere. You can't even clean the floor properly since it's covered with tatami, mats made of flimsy rice weed, which are destroyed if you even step on them forcefully, let alone wipe them. They have no proper doors or 
[14:04:50] <duds-> windows, just paper-thin covers that slide to the side which are always open in summer, meaning the inside of their "homes" is teeming with insects. In winter they sit inside at a kotatsu in full winter clothing because they don't know about isolation in the 21st century. Do I need to go on? I guess you're dizzy by now. "How could the country I adored for most of my adult life be such a backwater shithole?" I hear you squeal in disbelief. I know you 
[14:04:55] <duds-> weren't ready for this. But reality doesn't care about your feelings. I promise, you will be better off knowing this a few years down the road.
[14:08:16] <zoidberg> amigojapan: what the dickens is going on here?

[16:34:11] <amigojapan> zoidberg: worry is similar to pain. It is there to protect us against danger, but it is not helpful when we are overwhelmed with worry
[16:35:50] <zoidberg> No, it doesn‚Äôt. Worrying doesn‚Äôt do anything. It only makes one worse. If things are beyond control, there‚Äôs no point in worrying. If one can do something then do it instead of worrying about it. Either way worrying doesn‚Äôt do anything.
[16:36:17] <evolv> zoidberg, I don't know anything about Zen. I only follow Theravada
[16:36:31] <evolv> Mahayana traditions have distinct takes

[16:44:05] <amigojapan> evolv: I would not leave tomako
[16:44:07] <evolv> amigojapan, Mahayana traditions are unique like that, but Buddha made it very clear that marriage is unacceptable for nibbana
[16:44:25] <evolv> I mean, you could be married, sure, but you'll be celibate and can't even touch your partner
[16:44:39] <evolv> can't share a dwelling, neither
[16:44:42] <zoidberg> evolv: I‚Äôm not married. Actually I‚Äôm a virgin.
[16:45:20] <evolv> zoidberg, you could easily commit to most of the precepts. 8 of 10 would be very good, which requires celibacy

[16:52:27] <evolv> amigojapan, five precepts: No killing (direct killing, eating meat doesn't count, but you can't even kill insects), no stealing, no sexual misconduct (cheating, guilt tripping to get sex, getting someone to cheat with you, things like that), no lying, no drugs that cause heedlessness (alcohol, cannabis, but not things like caffeine, nicotine)

[16:54:22] <ezekielnoob> i get what you're saying tho
[16:54:37] <amigojapan> Gotcha evolv I think I am at least aiming to be such a person for the most part anyway
[16:54:42] <zoidberg> evolv: I have met some people who are nice without thinking about it. It‚Äôs like that comes to them naturally. It was then I realized such people exist. I mean they don‚Äôt think about it, they don‚Äôt think about it being a chore or a task or a favor to someone else. They just do it without any of these thoughts just to help the other person.
[16:54:57] <Roey> evolv: chocolate and tea are also great, A++++ on execution :) :)
[16:55:01] <evolv> amigojapan, yeah, you're likely following them almost to the T
[16:55:08] <evolv> Roey :D
[16:55:22] <amigojapan> Ty evolv 
[16:55:33] <evolv> Buddhism is fair. It's not puritanical, it's anti-puritanical (guilt and shame are unskillful)
[16:56:05] <amigojapan> evolv: I am not perfect tho. There are things I need to correct now and then
[16:56:38] <evolv> 5 precepts don't make perfection, anyway
[16:56:52] <evolv> there are 10 total, and over 200 rules for monastics
[16:56:54] <amigojapan> Ah ok evolv 
[16:57:36] <zoidberg> It‚Äôs very much an American thing to try to be perfect.
[16:57:38] <evolv> following 5 precepts assures rebirth in human realm
[16:57:44] <zoidberg> You people!
[16:58:00] <evolv> zoidberg, I'm pretty sure nibbana is perfection :P
[16:58:05] <evolv> that came from India
[16:58:23] <zoidberg> Nirvana?
[16:58:28] <evolv> yeah, I use the Pali
[16:58:39] <zoidberg> What‚Äôs Pali?
[16:59:01] <evolv> Vinaya, Sutta Pitaka, and Abhidhamma are the whole of the Tipitaka, the Pali Canon. The earliest Buddhist texts
[16:59:08] <amigojapan> evolv: you can reincarnate as an animal?
[16:59:29] <zoidberg> I see.
[16:59:33] <evolv> Pali is an Indo-Aryan language related to Sanskrit
[16:59:39] <evolv> it's Prakrit
[17:00:23] <zoidberg> It‚Äôs all foreign to me evolv. Most of what you‚Äôre saying, even the Indians don‚Äôt know.
[17:00:42] <evolv> amigojapan, yes. There are many realms to be reborn in. You can be reborn in Hell (don't worry about this), you can be reborn as an animal, a human, a deva, a Brahma, or a formless being
[17:01:13] <amigojapan> Weird evolv 
[17:01:29] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[17:01:31] <evolv> amigojapan, you could've killed someone in this lifetime, but if you follow the five precepts now until death, you won't go to hell
[17:01:45] <evolv> and hell is impermanent, anyway
[17:01:54] <evolv> as the heavenly realms, the formless realms, etc.
[17:02:04] <amigojapan> evolv: hell is a scare tactic of religions
[17:03:13] <evolv> hell is fluid, there is literal rebirth in hell, but there is hell in a lifetime. If you kill people, that intense guilt places you in hell regularly, it's just in the mind
[17:03:27] <amigojapan> evolv: there are tho hell like States in life
[17:03:45] <evolv> definitely hell-like states in life
[17:04:02] <evolv> zoidberg, I know :P
[17:04:13] <evolv> Indians know very little, if anything, about Buddhism
[17:05:06] <evolv> Advaita school was inspired by Buddhism, likely consumed a lot of Buddhists and potential Buddhists in India, among other reasons why Buddhism died out there
[17:06:48] <evolv> amigojapan, intense fear of hell is also unskillful and can put you in the hell-like state
[17:07:08] <amigojapan> Yeah evolv 
[17:07:23] <evolv> hell is an obvious undesirable realm. Less obvious to people are the heavenly realms as being undesirable

[21:54:30] <MootPoot> maybe not windows but widows
[21:55:36] <emmeka> anyone know if there's any good fansubs for Komi-san, or will be. I'm reading that Netflix (who exclusively licensed it) hasn't been subtitling any on screen text, because they suck at anime in general.
[21:56:53] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I don't know, but yes netflix sucks
[21:57:09] <emmeka> it is true
[21:57:12] <TsundereNoises> things like not subtittling text are depressingly common from other companies too though, with official subs
[21:57:19] <emmeka> it takes a special kind of suck to screw up Evangelion
[21:57:24] <TsundereNoises> a lot of times the really hyped up shows have better subs than the less hyped shows from the same distributer
[21:57:29] <TsundereNoises> and everyone ignores that
[21:57:51] <TsundereNoises> I mean netflix sucks, just also funi etc. aren't as good as people like to pretend sometimes, if you watch less popular shows
[21:57:56] <emmeka> Funi's been getting pretty good at subtitling all the things on screen, to say nothing of the quality of the subs themselves
[21:58:02] <TsundereNoises> sorry, this is a thing I've been mad about for years
[21:58:24] <TsundereNoises> the one that bugs me most is song lyrics for songs in an episode
[21:58:32] <TsundereNoises> especially in shows where the lyrics are really important
[21:58:38] <emmeka> oddly enough it's Sentai Filmworks that probably has the best actual subs tracks, which is like the budget licensor
[21:59:01] <TsundereNoises> I tend to default to fansubs whenever possible almost on principle
[22:00:02] <emmeka> TsundereNoises do you know a fansub group called Novaworks
[22:00:28] <TsundereNoises> no, I haven't watched anything by them
[22:00:33] <emmeka> apparently they're doing Komi-san.
[22:00:36] <TsundereNoises> give me a sec
[22:00:57] <TsundereNoises> yeah I'm looking at nyaa right now, but I haven't watched any of these. Most of the groups OTHER than Nova are groups I know more-or-less just rip the official subs
[22:01:14] <emmeka> only other guy is someone is who is doing French->English translation of a French fansub
[22:01:22] <emmeka> which, fair enough, but less than ideal
[22:01:29] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: at a glance, Nova looks pretty good to me, that'd actually be my first pick of those available to try
[22:01:36] <TsundereNoises> although I used to try like 3 or so per show at least

[22:06:42] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: but yeah, "subsplease," ASW, Yui, Anime-time are all just repackages of official subs, and I think last I checked Yui tended to actually be WORSE than their source somehow, while ASW sometimes but not always fixed bad typesetting and that's about it

[22:07:44] <Sadale> oh
[22:07:52] <emmeka> TsundereNoises yeah I'm aware of that
[22:07:56] <Sadale> Bet that it already exists.
[22:08:14] <emmeka> TsundereNoises a few of them are pulling subs from the guy who's doing French->English translation

[22:12:59] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I guess we should be grateful to Netflix. For having singlehandedly revived fansubbing.
[22:13:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: wrong, a LOT of people (idiots) pretend that AI is there to solve everything
[22:13:31] <MootPoot> I mean, you kind of assumed I meant that
[22:13:53] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yes, because it's a bizarrely common opinion, especially from people who have never tried to translate anything
[22:13:58] <TsundereNoises> translation is hard, yo
[22:14:12] <TsundereNoises> „Çà
[22:14:20] <MootPoot> traslation AI would basically be - ID the start and stop times of a sentence/line, and implant it in for you, and maybe seperate the voice lines if needed between the characters - basically automate all the overhead work of translation
[22:14:35] <MootPoot> so translation would be as easy as watching an episode and typing along
[22:14:41] <emmeka> translation is less input one word get another word than "try as best you can to have two consistent meanings from different ways of expressing the world"
[22:14:53] <emmeka> language isn't math.
[22:15:02] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: currently google usually identifies everything as korean (except korean) so I'm not sure I trust it to tell voices apart
[22:15:06] <MootPoot> lmao
[22:15:15] <MootPoot> well, I never said google did I?
[22:15:56] <emmeka> the ways that machine translation stumbles are pretty indicative of the problems
[22:16:03] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: about once a year I decide I'm going to try translating something as a learning exercise, I always DO learn a lot but then I realize it's just too tough and I should have spent more time studying all year
[22:16:33] <MootPoot> GPT is getting pretty good so far tbh
[22:17:10] <emmeka> the best machine translation can produce sentences which are intelligible, but ultimately retain the flow and sentence structure of the source language, which often results in it feeling unnatural, wrong, or even broken. And then there's issues of homonyms, registers, tone...
[22:17:14] <TsundereNoises> I hate how since deepl makes sentences that read more coherently, people treat it as if it's way better when it still makes lots of dumb mistakes
[22:17:24] <TsundereNoises> but those mistakes are just concealed and it SEEMS like it translated better
[22:17:30] <MootPoot> I'm confused
[22:17:35] <MootPoot> why are you lot bringing this up
[22:17:37] <TsundereNoises> sometimes google translate's word salad is almost better IMO
[22:18:08] <emmeka> MootPoot because you seem to think we can just make an AI translator, as if this is 1) possible 2) adequate
[22:18:11] <MootPoot> the actual translation is still to  be done by a human who words it correctly , machine just takes care of the annoying bits
[22:18:15] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: cause emmeka an I were already talking about translation and machine translation?
[22:18:23] <MootPoot> emmeka: if you think that clearly you haven't been reading what I posted
[22:18:23] <emmeka> machine assisted translation is already a thing
[22:18:52] <TsundereNoises> anyway, a tool to help with sub timing would be nice, I wonder if such a thing already exists
[22:18:56] <TsundereNoises> I do agree with that part
[22:19:06] <TsundereNoises> I'm just arguing with basically a rant I was halfway already having
[22:19:17] <emmeka> it doesn't accomplish much except make translation "easier", because you're proofreading, not writing. But it's the same amount of work
[22:19:22] <emmeka> it just requires less translation skill
[22:19:23] <MootPoot> The idea was to just make subbing easier - the only thing the AI would be doing is sepereating out voice lines per character and auto designating start/end times
[22:19:58] <TsundereNoises> I do really like subs that are color-coded by character
[22:20:05] <TsundereNoises> which is a lot of work
[22:20:05] <emmeka> MootPoot except these are picture-based subs with effects on on-screen text...
[22:20:19] <MootPoot> which subs are you talking about? the netflix ones?
[22:20:32] <emmeka> fansubs, in general.
[22:20:36] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I think MootPoot is talking more generally, not about what you and I were originally talking about
[22:20:41] <MootPoot> ^
[22:20:50] <emmeka> it still sounds terrible
[22:21:25] <emmeka> a lot of fansub effects and styling are basically art, not science
[22:21:27] <MootPoot> subbing should be easier - we can't fix the difficulty of making language sound and convey right just yet , but we can at least deal with the extra stupid legwork
[22:21:35] <TsundereNoises> I need to study more so I can contribute to saving fansubs one day
[22:21:38] <MootPoot> with computer
[22:22:19] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I guess I should be learning more french if I want to sub anime‚Ä¶

[22:24:23] <emmeka> I hate doing translation work tbh
[22:24:33] <emmeka> I've done it before, and it hurts my brain
[22:24:47] <MootPoot> emmeka: the closest analogy I can come up with is that computers cant write novels ; but people still write novels on computers and not paper these days for a reason - the computer removes a massive amount of extra bullshit leaving only the core task to be done
[22:25:11] <emmeka> the hard part isn't really getting word->word it's restructuring entire sentences to match the way the sentence would be written naturally in the target language
[22:25:21] <Jigsy> I've only ever subbed one thing.
[22:25:29] <Jigsy> Which was a Touhou OVA.
[22:25:33] <Jigsy> Because nobody else had bothered.
[22:26:08] <MootPoot> how much of a subbers time is taken up timing subs with the video for example
[22:26:51] <MootPoot> might not be that much, maybe like 15%, but that's mind numbing work that shouldn't have to be done manually 
[22:26:54] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I actually find it easier to write on paper and then type it in as part of revising
[22:27:02] <MootPoot> wha
[22:27:14] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: do you fax yourself your paper notes
[22:27:15] <MootPoot> lol
[22:27:34] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: it does help if you're trying to translate untranslated manga about cute girls being gay at each other

[22:28:26] <emmeka> it just occurred to me that the zoomers probably don't learn how to do rough drafts on paper anymore
[22:28:33] <MootPoot> what's paper
[22:28:35] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, when you write on paper it's hard to delete, makes it easier to turn off that internal editor
[22:28:36] <emmeka> which, is fine, they don't need to
[22:28:49] <TsundereNoises> and then you make the corrections when you type it in, just works better as a workflow for me

[22:31:38] <MootPoot> I can't remember shit either way
[22:31:39] <emmeka> it is true that when you do all writing in a text editor you are constantly enticed to stop and go back and try to edit the unfinished thing without completing it
[22:31:52] <emmeka> instead of just learning proper writing form first, and then writing, and then editing
[22:32:05] <MootPoot> when I used to write on paper I used to have the opposite problem
[22:32:08] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I get stuck on making the first sentence perfect, but it's often better to finish the thing and THEN go back
[22:32:21] <TsundereNoises> and some corrections you make in the moment (in red) turn out to be dumb on 2nd thought
[22:32:33] <MootPoot> start out  - write 10 words, fuck up, throw out the sheet, try again : 500 paper balls underneath my desk
[22:32:49] <emmeka> MootPoot you clearly didn't learn how to do rough drafts
[22:32:57] <TsundereNoises> I rarely throw out a sheet, I just strike through the line

[22:44:57] <TsundereNoises> like Êó•Êú¨Ë™û is so much shorter than "japanese" for example, takes less space and less time to write, so I just throw that in an english sentence, for exampe

[23:52:39] <Roey> you know.
[23:52:40] <emmeka> MootPoot huh, wait, ISO is a French Canadian thing? I didn't even know.
[23:52:45] <Roey> I know you know this, Berlin36 
[23:52:50] <Roey> wheat germ
[23:52:51] <dweltstorm> are the vegan sausages like tofu

[23:54:45] <MootPoot> most custom caps are like 30-40 anyway
[23:54:54] <Roey> Berlin36: Porridge is a simple stew usually made from oatmeal (sometimes oatmeal) or semolina, cooked in water or milk or both, usually seasoned with salt or sugar. Oats and semolina are the common grains for making porridge, however porridges can also be made from rice, wheat, pea flour, barley and corn starch. In Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, the matzah dish Bray (porridge in German: bray) is common, a type of fried porridge pulp made from matzah. 
[23:55:04] <Berlin36> it's really just soup with noodles and chicken but usually it might feel a little sour
[23:55:19] *** Quits: dweltstorm (~dweltstor@204.108.107.198) (Remote host closed the connection)
