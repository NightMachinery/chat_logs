[02:21:06] <constxd_> kept multiple return values AND added lists

[02:23:24] <constxd_> now im wondering if adding tuples was a mistake
[02:24:30] <constxd_> iDrougge: are the indices generated by the collection or by the loop construct
[02:25:33] <constxd_> i.e., can i make my own iterable collection and iterate over it with indices other than just 0, 1, 2, ...
[02:28:58] <iDrougge> constxd_: By the collection — I think. At least the indices are pertinent to the collection, so if you loop over a two-dimensional array, the indices are two-dimensional.
[02:34:01] <iDrougge> I think tuples are very nice in a sufficiently strongly typed language unless it has some other way to express feather weight objects.
[02:34:39] <constxd_> yeah my language is dynamically typed so idk if it really buys me much
[02:34:59] <constxd_> to be honesty my main reason for wanting it is i just hate the square brackets
[02:35:07] <constxd_> lol
[02:35:38] <iDrougge> What square brackets?
[02:35:38] <constxd_> like for example pipe() returns a pair of file descriptors, i hate the look of this
[02:35:48] <constxd_> let [r, w] = pipe();
[02:36:08] <constxd_> let (r, w) = pipe(); seems nicer
[02:36:49] <constxd_> or just let r, w = pipe();
[02:37:30] <constxd_> the motivation for multiple return values and tuples stems for not wanting to use the array syntax for returning / unpacking multiple values
[02:38:23] <iDrougge> [] or () looks the same to me, not knowing your language.
[02:38:43] <companion_cube> that seems like a lot of work to avoid 2 symbols, tbh
[02:38:46] <iDrougge> They both look like destructuring assignment to me.
[02:38:50] <constxd_> they both are
[02:39:00] <constxd_> but it feels wrong to use arrays
[02:39:07] <iDrougge> Oh, so you can destructure arrays?
[02:39:10] <constxd_> yes
[02:39:11] <companion_cube> does the iterator return arrays?
[02:39:33] <constxd_> no that seems ugly

[02:40:01] <constxd_> well
[02:40:25] <constxd_> if you iterate over an array or dict, there is no actual iterator object, those are special cases
[02:40:41] <constxd_> if you're iterating over some user-defined type, then the iterator returns 1 or more values
[02:41:07] <constxd_> say it returns a, b, c and your for loop looks like for x, y in foo { ... }
[02:41:11] <companion_cube> oh so you have a notion of multiple values being passed
[02:41:31] <constxd_> then on each iteration, a = x and b = y. c is ignored
[02:42:15] <iDrougge> Ignoring c feels like a possible source of bugs to me.
[02:42:17] <constxd_> well for loops are a built-in language construct so they handle the multiple return values specially. but the Iterable / Iterator classes also have a ton of methods

[02:43:57] <iDrougge> Why would you not want both then?
[02:44:00] <constxd_> if iterators just returned a single tuple then this inconsistency wouldn't exist
[02:44:07] <constxd_> i very well may want both, that's the problem
[02:44:26] <iDrougge> I would at least expect the map function to have an arity matching the iterator.
[02:45:47] <constxd_> there's no way to implement map, filter, drop, take, etc. to work that way

[02:51:13] <constxd_> how would you use it
[02:53:56] <iDrougge> I don’t know if it makes any sense, I was rather thinking of something like `new_for all_return_values in self { if f(unpack(all_return_values)) { yield all_return_values } }`
[02:54:30] <constxd_> hmm
[02:55:27] <constxd_> i guess that could work lol
[02:55:53] <constxd_> although having a separate keyword and loop construct for this is pretty bad
[02:56:19] <constxd_> i think i should just accept that
[02:56:24] <iDrougge> Yes, it would indicate that `for` is insufficient.
[02:56:32] <constxd_> yeah
[02:57:46] <imode> side note, what the fuck is a 'for' loop. why do we use 'for'. I know it comes from 'for each' or 'for all' or 'for some', i.e quantifiers, but I've seen students struggle with the "why is it called 'for'" problem than far longer than you'd probably anticipate.
[02:57:47] <iDrougge> Perhaps Ruby is right in using `iter.each do …` instead of having a privileged loop construct.

[03:02:09] <companion_cube> you can make a new one that calls `x1.next(); x2.next(); x1.next(); …` etc.
[03:02:24] <companion_cube> can't do that with .each methods, they're like loops, you can't interleave two loops

[03:03:28] <iDrougge> companion_cube: All right, I presumed each in Ruby was built upon iterators.
[03:03:41] <constxd_> explicitly calling next() on iterator should be pretty rare i think
[03:04:01] <constxd_> iDrougge: it is -- i believe it's a part of the Enumerable class
[03:05:02] <iDrougge> Because that’s what I mean when I suggested each may be a better choice if you already have iterators and higher order functions.
[03:05:05] <constxd_> wait actually it's part of Array
[03:05:24] <constxd_> being able to return is critical though
[03:06:18] <imode> what's the iterator equivalent to three or more nested for loops.
[03:06:28] <imode> is it just the three of them interleaved.

[03:07:54] <constxd_> yeah my answer is meant to be general too
[03:08:00] <constxd_> usually iterators aren't rewindable
[03:08:25] <imode> theoretically all you'd need to do is reset to the begining position on each exhaustive iteration.
[03:08:36] <constxd_> interleave doesn't correspond to nested loops, it corresponds to one loop where on each iteration you advance multiple iterators
[03:08:46] <imode> yeah, that's what I figured.
[03:08:59] <constxd_> in general iterators don't have beginning positions
[03:09:15] <imode> sure they do.
[03:09:41] <constxd_> not in the general case
[03:10:08] <imode> for iterators over collections or with well-defined bounds, sure.
[03:10:27] <constxd_> yes some can be rewound

[17:57:00] <leonardo> vesto: i suppose you can use tags, like https://lobste.rs/t/cryptography -> https://lobste.rs/t/cryptography.rss
[17:57:01] <mockturtle> [ Lobsters: cryptography - Cryptography ] - lobste.rs
[17:58:21] <leonardo> and since combining them using comma works, you can use it on rss too https://lobste.rs/t/distributed,cryptography.rss

[17:59:04] <leonardo> (which is pretty neat if i may say so)
[18:06:29] <vesto> yeah I saw the per-tags thing which seems like a cool way to curate but I was hoping to get the point-based one so I could keep the topics broad but only surface the higher-ranking posts
[18:06:43] <vesto> sounds like it might not be available which is totally fine- was just curious :)
[18:06:59] <vesto> thanks for the tag thing tho, I'll give it a shot and see if I can make it work

[21:57:51] <gerikson> what a weird submission
[21:58:02] <imode> huh.
[21:58:16] <gerikson> also a reminder that the people who were super-into poker a decade ago are now NFTards
[21:58:29] <imode> did you read/skim the article.
[21:58:48] <imode> it's tackling a project euler problem in two languages.
[21:59:16] <imode> seems alright to me.
[21:59:31] <jmiven> gerikson: what a weird reaction ^^
[22:00:25] <gerikson> oh, it's a PE problem
[22:00:41] <gerikson> I solved it by using a Pelr module
[22:02:14] <gerikson> jmiven: techbros are putting my panties in a twist a lot these days
[22:02:32] <imode> considering a web3 grift article is at the top of the front page, I wonder why.
[22:02:54] <imode> it's being pushed up there pretty hard.
[22:05:08] <gerikson> Moxie is ... respected
[22:05:17] <gerikson> and that article is better than most
[22:05:41] <riv> uh by who
[22:05:43] <riv> lol
[22:05:57] <imode> I don't respect anybody who takes web3 seriously. it is not worth discussing.
[22:06:11] <jmiven> I've stopped trying to understand the score of stories on lobsters, it can be quite mysterious
[22:06:33] <imode> it is an attempt by grifters to legitimize their grift by presenting their rainforest burning and scam artistry as a logical conclusion to a totally ancillary technology. they hijacked a concept and a version number.
[22:06:54] <imode> as far as I'm concerned, that story is malicious and so is the person who wrote it. it is not worth debating or reading.
[22:07:18] <imode> the more platform you give to this, the more grifters benefit.
[22:07:28] <gerikson> actually this poker article is super interesting
[22:07:43] <gerikson> good explanation of bitfields
[22:07:51] <imode> quality submission, IMO.
[22:08:20] <imode> though why #defines instead of an enum?
