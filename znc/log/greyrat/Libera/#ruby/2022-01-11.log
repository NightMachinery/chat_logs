[00:04:00] <adam12> DenKn: Strange. Is that address listed in /etc/resolv.conf?
[00:04:54] <DenKn> in resolv.conf?  You mean /etc/hosts?
[00:05:07] <adam12> DenKn: What OS?
[00:05:16] <DenKn> nixos
[00:05:39] <DenKn> I do not know, if it also happened with ubuntu/debian.
[00:05:57] <DenKn> Btw, if the wireguard-interface is not available, it will not happen.
[00:06:04] <adam12> Well, I'm not sure where that address/port combo came frome. It's kind of strange.
[00:06:17] <adam12> I wonder if wireguard can push dns servers? Maybe it's pushing dns records for that address.
[00:08:16] <DenKn> In my case one DNS-Server provided by an IP behind the wg-interface is used for some domains, but [ff02::fb]:5353 is not DNS, it is mDNS
[00:08:37] *** Quits: cahoots (~cahoots@cpe-68-173-58-87.nyc.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:09:55] <DenKn> I had to allow ff02::fb on the other side to prevent this error by network.  But, I would say, this would be a ruby-error.  ENOKEY should be rescued and no answer returned.
[00:11:29] <adam12> I didn't realize mDNS had an unprivileged port. Interesting.
[00:11:51] <adam12> DenKn: Might be worth a bug report. bugs.ruby-lang.org. I'm not sure what else to suggest.
[00:12:58] <DenKn> Why ruby tries it instead of using nss?
[00:13:43] <DenKn> Wow, this would be my first bugreport after 20 years.

[01:41:53] <Aylat> Hello folks, i'm switching to Ruby and wanna know if there's some cheatsheet or great webpage to learn the best practices of this language
[01:42:42] <Aylat> i've seen a quite few on top of google results, but they were... too little info, only talking about using "until" instead of while 
[01:50:50] <weaksauce> Aylat book route i'd go with eloquent ruby
[01:51:13] <weaksauce> online route the odin project looks useful 
[01:52:07] <Aylat> I'll check that book so, thanks! 
[01:52:11] <LACampbe1> I quite liked 'Practical Object Oriented Design'. though arguably it's not a ruby book, it's an OOD book that happens to use ruby
[01:52:25] <Aylat> I'm just switching from python, and all my code seems pythonic
[01:52:37] *** LACampbe1 is now known as LACampbell
[01:52:41] <Aylat> i just wanna learn some tips and best practices
[01:53:01] <LACampbell> example of pythonic ruby code?
[01:53:17] <legit> +1 for Eloquent Ruby
[01:53:29] <legit> It's a bit dated, but it's still awesome!
[01:53:36] <Aylat> i've seen before things like adding "!" to methods like uppercase 
[01:53:44] <Aylat> and i loved it
[01:54:06] <weaksauce> ? is for boolean questions 
[01:54:12] <weaksauce> ! is for "dangerous" things 
[01:54:33] <weaksauce> stuff that might throw an error or change an object in place 
[01:54:34] <Aylat> well, LACampbell, i dont know, just writed my first real good script on ruby and seems pretty similar to python
[01:55:14] <Aylat> oh, nice weaksauce, see, things like that (or tips) is what i'm searching for
[01:55:35] <weaksauce> eloquent ruby is your best friend then... it teaches idiomatic ruby 
[01:55:40] *** Quits: oxfuxxx (~oxfuxxx@160.238.38.154) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:55:52] <weaksauce> and it's slightly out of date but nothing fundamentally has really changed in there
[01:56:09] <Aylat> i'm tired of looking for ruby tips and finding thing like "ruby is awesome because you can ommit the parentheiss", yeah, that's great but not a game breaker
[01:56:22] *** Joins: oxfuxxx (~oxfuxxx@160.238.38.154)
[01:56:50] <Aylat> eloquent ruby seems a perfect match for my questioj
[01:57:22] <LACampbell> yeah ruby copied that from scheme
[02:13:34] <havenwood> Aylat: For book, I'd highly recommend Polished Ruby Programming by Jeremy Evans. https://www.amazon.com/Polished-Ruby-Programming-maintainable-high-performance-ebook/dp/B093TH9P7C
[02:13:45] <havenwood> It's a newer one, but best.
[02:14:11] <Aylat> i'll take a look so
[02:16:03] <havenwood> Aylat: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/
[02:16:17] <havenwood> Aylat: What language are you coming from?
[02:16:54] <havenwood> Aylat: Here's the style guide that corresponds to the Rubocop linting tool. https://rubystyle.guide/
[02:17:06] <havenwood> It's the closest we have to a `ruby format` command.
[02:17:10] <havenwood> rubocop -A
[02:17:15] <havenwood> gem install rubocop
[02:17:26] <havenwood> Most text editors have an integration option.
[02:18:43] <Aylat> Coming from php and python

[02:29:29] <havenwood> Aylat: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/to-ruby-from-php/
[02:29:49] <Aylat> yeah i've readed that, but it's pretty basic
[02:29:54] <havenwood> Those highlight a few differences between Ruby and PHP/Python. True, basic.
[02:30:07] <havenwood> There's a lot of similarity.
[02:31:10] <havenwood> I'd normally recommend zenspider's quick ref, but seems offline.

[03:28:42] <weaksauce> is it just ebook?
[03:28:59] <adam12> I have the ebook because I was given an early review copy, but there are physical copies out there.
[03:29:54] <weaksauce> ah nice
[03:30:10] <weaksauce> i like books much more for this kinda thing
[03:30:28] <adam12> Yeah. I flip flop. I buy physical books for ones I figure I'll likely care about. 
[03:30:52] <adam12> But some books have been interesting to find lately. I've been getting a ton from Seattle Goodwill, which sounds strange but makes sense considering their geographic location.
[03:31:10] <adam12> ie. Ruby Under a Microscope and Elegant Ruby are both out of print (afaik) and I sourced them from there (via ebay)
[03:31:12] <weaksauce> mainly the code formatting is always terrible 
[03:31:40] <weaksauce> yeah i bought mine a long time ago and it was probably full price 
[03:31:51] <adam12> I have a local book place that has great deals on books, but very few Ruby ones. https://bookoutlet.ca
[03:32:06] <adam12> But I got Ask Your Developer, The Right It, and a bunch of other good ones there.
[03:32:18] <adam12> bbiaf. putting kids to bed.

[16:35:21] <ruby[bot]> Henry151: we in #ruby do not like pastebin.com, it loads slowly for most, has ads which are distracting and has terrible formatting. Please use https://gist.github.com
[16:36:08] <adam12> Henry151: That's an interesting one.

[16:37:52] <adam12> Henry151: The only suggestion I can offer is to not use system ruby (the one that came with your Mac). Install a separate one, which will be newer.
[16:38:10] <Henry151> ah, excellent guidance, i'll give that a shot
[16:39:27] <Henry151> is there some sort of version manager or recommended process for having multiple ruby installs? or do i just upgrade my system install to the latest?
[16:39:33] <adam12> Henry151: I suggest using the tool `Frum`. https://mac.install.guide/ruby/14.html
[16:39:48] <adam12> It's a good catch-all, with few moving parts.

[17:00:55] <Henry151> thanks for the guidance adam12 .. i've installed ruby 3.1.0, but when i run "pod install" it still is trying to use 2.6.0... could you point me at how to specify the correct version?
[17:01:41] <Henry151> ah i just had to scroll down the page further
[17:01:42] <Henry151> pardon
[17:10:32] <Henry151> hmm, well now i'm experiencing this issue: https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/frum/issues/113

[17:12:55] <Henry151> then, trying to solve that, I ran "gem source -r https://rubygems.org" and tried to run "gem source -a https://rubygems.org" but the second command failed with that same openssl error, so now i don't have a repository source XD
[17:13:40] <Henry151> i'm a debian linux user typically, this is my first week with a macbook.

[18:11:45] <adam12> Doesn't seem too bad.
[18:16:14] <adam12> (the average is likely useless and I probably should use the mean but oh well)

[18:21:39] <adam12> Henry151: pod issue or ruby issue?
[18:22:01] <Henry151> installled ruby with "frum install 3.0.3 --with-openssl-dir=`brew --prefix openssl`" .. when i do gem install cocoapods i get "openssl is not available" error
[18:22:26] <adam12> Henry151: Confirm ruby version with `ruby --version`
[18:22:29] *** Joins: henninb (~henninb@97-116-147-100.mpls.qwest.net)
[18:22:43] <Henry151> 3.0.3
[18:22:53] <adam12> ruby -S gem install cocoapods
[18:23:09] <adam12> Does that work?
[18:23:20] <Henry151> "openssl not available"
[18:23:48] <adam12> This is gonna burn your ass, but I bet it's because it linked to the wrong OpenSSL version.
[18:24:01] <adam12> Which might require a re-install of Ruby.
[18:24:05] <Henry151> hmm ok
[18:24:27] <Henry151> i've reinstalled ruby 6 times so far during this attempt :) so that's fine
[18:24:37] <Henry151> i guess the brew --prefix openssl is giving the wrong path?
[18:24:42] <adam12> Henry151: Instead of --prefix openssl, you probably need openssl@1.1
[18:25:03] <Henry151> it is pointing at /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl1@3
[18:25:05] <adam12> Ruby doesn't support openssl3 yet
[18:25:24] <adam12> ls /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl*
[18:26:10] <Henry151> i have two folders, /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl and /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3
[18:26:19] <adam12> Oh. No 1.1? Hmm...
[18:26:51] <Henry151> ... brew install openssl1.1 ? or similar?
[18:27:31] <Henry151> i'm brand new to mac world, been a debian linux daily-driver for 18 years..
[18:27:36] <adam12> Henry151: What does `brew info openssl@1.1` say?
[18:27:46] <adam12> I mean, it will say a bunch
[18:27:58] <adam12> but does it mention `Not installed` in the first few lines?
[18:28:06] <Henry151> it does say Not installed
[18:28:07] <Henry151> yep
[18:28:37] <Henry151> `brew install openssl@1.1` ?
[18:28:51] <adam12> OK. `brew install openssl@1.1`, then recompile ruby using `brew --prefix openssl@1.1`
[18:29:36] <adam12> In _theory_ that should work. If it doesn't, I'd say just disable frum, brew install ruby, and go on with your life for now. I'd definitely not use brew ruby long term, but it would unblock you since I bet this isn't what you want to do all day.
[18:29:53] <adam12> But those instructions I just showed you are what I use for installing Ruby as of a few days ago, so I'm presuming they should work.
[18:30:41] <Henry151> this is fine i'm enjoying learning, thank you for your help, i'll let you know how this works in a moment
[18:35:07] <Henry151> seems to have worked

[20:11:46] <rapha> adam12: i think the options #pretty_generate invokes #generate with are already pretty much the optimum given what options are available. the rule i would like to apply is too complex ("leave all hashes with only one key as one single line") for what they make available.
