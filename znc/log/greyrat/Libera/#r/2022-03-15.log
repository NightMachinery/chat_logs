[00:15:21] <Bayes> can't you have list columns with base R data.frames?
[00:26:50] <rickyrick> Yeah but printing them dumps the whole list element to the screen
[00:26:58] <rickyrick> tibbles just put <list>

[04:34:41] <velix> my hack: c_map[rowSums(is.na(c_map)) != ncol(c_map)-1, ]
[04:34:44] <velix> since_: a kick bot?
[04:35:05] <since_> One who executes an R command
[04:35:18] <velix> didn't we have one in the past?
[04:35:25] <velix> I really remember this...
[04:35:32] <velix> ah no, it was rickyrick 
[04:35:57] <since_> drop_na
[04:36:17] <velix> since_: it's not that easy. the "all by one column" is the problematik part.
[04:36:27] <velix> I know the R syntax, but the combination is hard.
[04:36:42] <since_> I dont understand the second condition
[04:36:53] <velix> drop all columns, but one, which are NA.
[04:36:59] <velix> I've got one column which carries IDs.
[04:37:14] <velix> ah yeah... you're right. The IDs is never empty.
[04:37:16] <velix> you're right
[04:37:52] <velix> No wait, you're not ;)
[04:37:56] <velix> 123 NA NA NA NA NA NA 
[04:38:00] <velix> 124 NA NA NA 1 NA NA 
[04:38:05] <velix> I want to remove 123
[04:38:19] <velix> I think my hack is fine for this.
[04:38:36] <velix> df[rowSums(is.na(df)) != ncol(df)-1, ]
[04:38:56] <velix> since ID is never NA, this should work.
[04:41:21] <since_> Also above selecting columns that match label:
[04:42:11] <since_> labels <- colnames(df) %>% .[grep("pattern", .)
[04:42:30] <since_> And then do df[,labels]
[04:43:08] <velix> since_: it doesn't work like that, since the labels are in attr()
[04:43:33] <rickyrick> velix: Heyeyey goodbye

[05:38:00] <velix> Can I make dbWriteTable() write numeric instead of double into my postgres?
[05:38:41] <velix> urgs, only via field.types :(
[05:38:45] <velix> lots of typing.
[05:38:48] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[05:38:58] <rickyrick> Just alter the colspec after
[05:39:43] <velix> yeah, 208 columns
[05:39:52] <velix> just because ONE is string ;)
[05:40:15] <velix> can't I make c('string', repeat(208, 'numeric')?
[05:40:19] <rickyrick> I guess so
[05:40:21] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[05:40:32] <rickyrick> The command you want is rep()
[05:40:44] <velix> yes. But I think I need to give it DBI types... need to look it up
[05:41:01] <velix> "numeric" seems to be fine.
[05:41:05] <rickyrick> Yeah if you want postgresql numeric you probably want to specify the number of digits before and after the decimal though
[05:41:13] <velix> rickyrick: no, PG doesn't need this.
[05:41:21] <velix> if you don't specify it, it's > 2000 by default.
[05:41:23] <velix> totally fine ;)
[05:41:25] <rickyrick> :^)
[05:41:34] <rickyrick> I've only used number to store currency values
[05:41:50] <velix> many statistical functions need numeric
[05:42:12] <velix> I only store numeric because it's lossless.
[05:42:20] <velix> you put in 3.2382842389478934 and it'll stay this
[05:42:27] <velix> not 3.2839999999999999999993832183
[05:42:36] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[05:43:02] <velix> PostgreSQL also supports calculations in fractions, that's damn nice.
[05:43:22] <velix> it finds the fraction for 0.3333333333 for example and you can calculate in integers only :D
[05:43:30] <velix> 1/3 * 310/322 + 282/2999
[05:43:48] <velix> I'm using R in PostgreSQL a lot.
[05:43:48] <rickyrick> So can calc.exe
[05:43:55] <rickyrick> Are you using PL/R too
[05:45:22] <velix> yes
[05:45:35] <velix> R supports 7 types of percentils (quantils) ;)
[05:45:47] <velix> even the one SPSS uses. 
[05:46:00] <velix> We've figured out that the calculation of percentils is different in the US.
[05:46:04] <velix> No joke.
[05:46:08] <velix> SPSS does the US style.
[05:46:14] <velix> PostgreSQL does the European style.
[05:46:19] <velix> That's why I need PL/R
[05:46:40] <velix> ESRI ArcGIS also does the US style

[05:57:17] <velix> no wait, it's 1 column too long?
[05:57:38] <rickyrick> I think you mixed up the names and the values?
[05:58:12] <velix> names first, type last?
[05:58:24] <rickyrick> Yeah setNames(value, name)
[05:59:52] <velix> YES! you were right.

[18:14:44] <Bayes> so, what I'm googling on right now is the "correct" way to allow a function argument to take a limited number of options
[18:15:20] <Bayes> e.g., f(x, y, returnAs) where returnAs can be "list", "long" or "wide" only
[18:15:54] <Bayes> I'm thinking of using switch(returnAs, ...) to handle it, but I was wondering if there's a way to define an argument that can only take a possibly set of values
[18:17:30] <Bayes> and I'm studying this example from ?match.arg http://ix.io/3Skf

[20:16:17] <Bayes> http://ix.io/3Sl6
[20:16:30] <Bayes> that, I'm tempted to report the table but it's, you know, kinda eyesore
[20:16:34] <rickyrick> Yeah probably stacked bar
[20:17:07] <rickyrick> Though really you only have two columns since the first one will probably be invisible
[20:17:14] <Bayes> yep, that's my issue
[20:17:38] <Bayes> but those are kinda important, maybe, cause these are 215 obs out of 10k that are non-negative :///
[20:17:49] <Bayes> mfw can't take log
[20:18:01] <rickyrick> Yeah so just do two separate plots?

[20:19:14] <Bayes> of course outliers

[20:23:17] <Bayes> is that an actual quote or just internet trolling?
[20:23:43] <rickyrick> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZe5J8SVCYQ
[20:24:26] <Bayes> lmao
[20:24:35] <Bayes> I mean it kind of make sense under some assumptions I guess
[20:24:42] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[20:24:48] <Bayes> how many times we prove things by saying that "it's not something else, so it must be this!"
[20:24:59] <rickyrick> "prove"
[20:25:08] <Bayes> and then qed ＼(＾▽＾)／
[20:25:09] <rickyrick> Just gotta generalize to "it's not everything else"
[20:25:12] <Bayes> “There is no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher” -Mr. Miyagi lmao
[20:25:20] <Bayes> ^ that's from a youtube quote
[20:25:25] <Bayes> s/quote/comment
[20:25:40] <Bayes> dude science is so full of holes
[20:25:48] <Bayes> I'm really surprised we haven't blown up this planet so far
[20:25:54] <Bayes> I'd say we're quite a lucky species
[20:26:34] <Bayes> The protos: "sigh these humans are really so dang lucky outliers huh"
[20:27:40] <Bayes> dude I'm working with some data that's super interesting and the model, despite having some "complex" correlation structure, the correlation structure is quite explicit and it makes a lot of sense
[20:28:07] <Bayes> but one "observation" is a vector of size 3125
[20:29:10] <Bayes> XDDD so despite those 3125 measurements of the same shit having a reasonably digestible correlation structure... imagine inverting them cov matrices of size 3125 * n xD
[20:30:12] <rickyrick> apply sparsity, problem solve
[20:30:16] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[20:30:33] <Bayes> for sure
[20:30:42] <Bayes> that's what they've been doing so far
[20:30:49] <Bayes> assume all things are separable
[20:30:56] <Bayes> which are LIES
[20:31:07] <Bayes> I have plots showing these are LIES
[20:31:46] <Bayes> I smell markov procresses
[20:32:04] <Bayes> to keep some correlation with n = 1 neighbor in each dimension and fuck it

[21:03:27] <Bayes> oh btw, I was thinking about this the other day but I didn't really find a strong argument for rmarkdown over sweave
[21:03:43] <Bayes> is there a strong selling point of rmarkdown over sweave?
[21:04:26] <fendur> by sweave, do you mean latex that embeds R compared with R markdown?
[21:05:07] <Bayes> I mean good ol' Rnw files
[21:05:14] <Bayes> so, yes
[21:05:32] <fendur> can sweave be used to generate HTML?
[21:06:11] <Bayes> i don't know, I wouldn't say it doesn't ootb
[21:06:16] <Bayes> but I'm not expert
[21:06:29] <fendur> that's my primary use case for rmarkdown, and rmarkdown does that pretty well
[21:06:34] <Bayes> do you prefer html for deliverables?
[21:06:52] <fendur> not for reports
[21:07:10] <fendur> but we do some "light" dashboards with rmarkdown, and i do internal reporting with HTML
[21:07:17] <Bayes> ah
[21:07:26] <Bayes> fancy fendur huh
[21:07:48] <fendur> people love it
[21:08:23] <Bayes> sounds cool
[21:08:48] <Bayes> what do you use for a ligh dashboard? flexdashboard or highly tweaked html_document ?
[21:09:33] <Bayes> I used flexdashboard and it was ok for generating a small html page that had a few tabs and that... a sort of dashboard that runs locally for all precomputed things
[21:09:37] <fendur> just an HTML generated by r markdown. usually makes use of tabs.
[21:10:05] <fendur> we serve it from our shinyproxy server so we can put a password on it, if we need to.
[21:10:42] <fendur> tabs or some other navigation functionality.
[21:11:07] <fendur> yes all precomputed
[21:12:20] <Bayes> uhm ok that's nice
[21:17:20] <fendur> leaflet maps really impress, too
[21:17:21] <fendur> :)
[21:30:03] <Bayes> yeah that sounds nice for that kind of data
[21:30:11] <Bayes> the thing I'm still looking for
[21:30:24] <Bayes> is some format with image + comments
[21:30:50] <Bayes> kinda like a slide where you have an image + a few short bullet points
[21:31:02] <Bayes> but something better than that
[21:31:25] <fendur> can render to slides. what's the "better" part?
[21:32:42] <Bayes> I don't know, I feel like an image and comments on the same slide fight for the attention/space, and having them in separate slides kinda beats the point
[21:33:06] <Bayes> so maybe some very slick format that maximizes the image size and has small font notes
[21:33:12] <fendur> sometimes i use tabs for that sort of thing. like here's a chapter with 10 tabs, each with a plot and maybe some description
[21:33:33] <Bayes> or something slightly more fancy like a full page image with a sidebar comment that pops in when you hover or something
[21:34:02] <Bayes> do you place your content in two columns (left image, right text) or two rows (fig top, text below)
[21:34:09] <fendur> and maybe the chapters are themselves organized as pill buttons
[21:34:25] <Bayes> what html theme do you render to?
[21:34:37] <Bayes> as in the rmarkdown yaml preamble
[21:34:41] <fendur> i imagine i could organize it like that. but usually i just put the image front and center and then text under it so i just scroll to the bottom to see that.
[21:34:53] <fendur> i don't even seelct one. i use the basic one. it looks great.
[21:35:00] <fendur> default
[21:35:02] <fendur> i meant
[21:35:33] <Bayes> t'is ? fig 7.4 https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-tabs.html
[21:35:43] <Bayes> ok
[21:35:47] <Bayes> will check it out
[21:36:12] <fendur> yeah exactly. add .tabset-pills to have a different type of tab (buttons)
[21:36:29] <fendur> and add .tabset-fade to make it switch more smoothly
[21:36:44] <Bayes> oh fancy fendur strikes again
[21:36:55] <Bayes> gonna start calling you ffendur lmao
[21:37:04] <Bayes> oh actually, fandur lmao
[21:37:34] <fendur> wat? that's two references i didn't understand in two days
[21:37:35] <fendur> :)
[21:37:54] <Bayes> well I typically export to a plain horrible file
[21:38:00] <Bayes> but you have some fancy set up
[21:38:13] <Bayes> so that makes you fancy+fendur = fandur
[21:38:17] <fendur> ahh
[21:38:21] <fendur> now i see it
[21:38:31] <Bayes> you don't have to make any sense of the stuff I spit out
[21:38:41] <fendur> yeah same here
[21:38:50] <Bayes> I mean, it's not that you don't have to, it's more like you can't make sense out of my shit xD
[21:39:04] <fendur> there was some page called Pimp My Rmd that had a bunch of useful tips for rmarkdown
[21:39:11] <Bayes> oh :o
[21:39:38] <Bayes> what a horrible name but I'll google it up I guess
[21:40:39] <Bayes> https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/
[21:43:39] <fendur> i haven't looked in a while. the templates are new to me
