[00:45:52] <ThePendulum> you can get the selection range from the input to see where the cursor is at, I'd be careful messing too much with it, though, it gets messy quickly

[01:16:41] <sheetjs> let's start with 9b, there's a bunch of corner cases lopped in
[01:21:12] <ljharb> basically i can call into the original implementation, except when the receiver is finite, and fractionDigits is an in-range integer

[01:26:19] <sheetjs> i didn't look at the chakra code too closely but it looks like edge is doing round to zero
[01:26:37] <ljharb> oh, and it should be doing normal rounding of 5 up, < 5 down?
[01:27:14] <sheetjs> yeah the spec talks about being "closer"
[01:28:36] <ljharb> ok so, when fractionalDigits is 1 less than the limit, at least, theoretically i could +1 it, get the original result, and then truncate and properly round that last remaining digit?

[02:33:55] <austincheney> the MediaStreamConstraints object sets the actual pixel size of the video output stream.  Resizing using CSS will change the size of the video element, but it will not change the stream object thereby resulting in a distorted (lower resolution) output

[04:27:33] <sheetjs> in such a way that 1 and 3 existed and the process started from 2 ?
[04:27:55] <sheetjs> electrostatic: there's SubtleCrypto but that API is unfortunately promise based
[04:28:05] <ThePendulum> it shouldn't have created 1 and 3 without 2 inbetween
[04:29:22] <sheetjs> say you started the process, it generates 1/2/3.  you stop the process and manually remove 2.  then you start again
[04:29:25] <sheetjs> what happens?

[09:04:53] <GreenJello> site X has the cookie, and site Y has the form. At an earlier point in time sites X and Y have been given the same secret key (or public/private keys respectively). The user fills out the form and submits it to site Y, with CSRF prevention if needed, and then it uses the secret key to sign the form data, and redirects to site X with the data and signature in URL query parameters
[09:05:33] <GreenJello> site X receives the GET request and cookies, verifies the signature, and completes the transaction
[09:07:00] <GreenJello> there is an issue, though
[09:07:20] <GreenJello> you don't have the identity of the user in the signature
[09:07:29] <Slade> indeed
[09:08:04] <Slade> really wish my cookies had allow lists :p
[09:11:51] <Rockwood> bye cya
[09:11:52] <Slade> that'd be abuse tho

[09:23:10] <GreenJello> more or less what I described
[09:23:24] <GreenJello> but you still have the issue that it's not user-specific
[09:23:46] <GreenJello> since site Y doesn't know which user is filling out the form
[09:24:27] <Slade> yea
[09:24:59] <Slade> could just bind /auth to both, course they'd have to login twice
[09:25:25] <GreenJello> you really can't redirect to the main site for the form part?
[09:25:44] <Slade> maybe stuff it in an iframe?
[09:25:59] <GreenJello> would require same site: none

[11:07:51] <sheetjs> have an open source disclosure page

[11:10:46] <sheetjs> assumably in a commercial product
[11:12:38] *** jazzy2 is now known as jazzy
[11:12:39] <ljharb> yes but a product distributed how
[11:12:51] <shan> sheetjs: no, i'm just wondering how licensing works on MIT-licensed libraries
[11:13:04] <shan> react is a popular example, so
[11:13:24] <sheetjs> https://tasks.office.com/License.html for example
[11:13:39] <sheetjs> office 365 planner uses RequireJS which is MIT licensed
[11:13:46] <sheetjs> somewhere in the eula is a link to that page
[11:13:54] <shan> worlds worst html file amirite
[11:14:00] <ljharb> shan: it depends on if you distribute react or not
[11:14:09] <ljharb> shan: if it's just an npm package, for example, you don't distribute react, so you have zero obligations there
[11:14:13] <shan> but thank you sheetjs i think i understand
[11:14:26] <shan> ljharb: oh, because my users would be downloading it
[11:14:28] <shan> nice
[11:14:31] <ljharb> yes
[11:14:47] <ljharb> it's only the website, or a bundled up RN or electron app, or something, where this comes into play for JS
[11:14:55] <shan> right
[11:15:12] <sheetjs> or an on-prem deployment of a saas
[11:16:05] <ljharb> maybe
[11:16:07] <sheetjs> the only situation where MIT license disclosure is not strictly needed is for server-side use on your infrastructure because technically you would be the end user and ostensibly disclosed it to yourself
[11:16:22] <ljharb> or when the user installs the MIT software themselves
[11:16:25] <sheetjs> if you're distributing a server appliance (e.g. a virtualbox image)
[11:16:39] <ljharb> ie, any project that has the user do some kind of `npm install`, `gem install`, etc step, all those installed deps are their problem not yours
[11:17:37] <ljharb> or rather, the installing user's problem, not the project authors' problem
[11:19:17] <sheetjs> if theres a question, better to err on the side of disclosure

[17:53:29] <DPA> I prefer not to use them, but I'd say something to lazily & automatically load components & subcomponents. Simple MVVM can also be nice, but it's gone out of fashion, so I currently like frameworks not getting in the way, and just signaling things with events.

[18:03:03] <DPA> Well, let's say I have some custom button, menu, or whatever. Those may be a component I reuse, so I want some way to easily do that / let the framework do it for me.
[18:03:03] <DPA> The other thing is just about syncing the DOM and the data in it. MVVM approaches used stuff like Object.observe & event listeners, and tried to keep the DOM and an object in sync by updating each other if one changes.
[18:03:03] <DPA> That went out of favour I think, most things nowadays seam to have some state, and something to render it, and changes have t obe manually applied to the state and the rerender triggered.
[18:03:03] <DPA> The event approache is basically to only use what the browser provides for signaling, and works differently again. Some controller updates elements & data, and registers event listeners to detect changes. But to inform other
[18:03:03] <DPA> components of changes in a decoupled way, one can just dispatch an event, and the components which care about it listen for it.

[18:17:26] <TomyWork> hi. I'm trying to solve a browser problem using JS. in particular, firefox, at some point, removed the ability to delete subdomain cookies or even individual cookies. I have a list of the cookie names and I tried deleting them using the following snippet: https://gist.github.com/TomyLobo/b377e322effb75ff4c0bc00525c2bd96 didn't help. what am I doing wrong?
[18:17:31] <shan> DPA: right, that's what i was looking into
[18:18:27] <TomyWork> if I add "HttpOnly" to the end of that cookie string, I get Cookie “JSESSIONID.83cb6485” has been rejected because there is already an HTTP-Only cookie but script tried to store a new one.
[18:19:03] <DPA> It's important but a bit tricky sometimes to differentiate which things should be actions / direct function calls, and which ones should be reactions / events.

[22:34:22] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[22:34:28] <ljharb> matsaman: fair point
[22:34:34] <matsaman> we need a way to compare downloads I guess...

[22:34:51] <matsaman> as a lib? Ok
[22:34:53] <ljharb> matsaman: and there's no better metric than downloads afaik, altho i agree that's a poor one
[22:34:54] <sheetjs> the differences are really irreconcilable.  To those that use MIT or BSD or Apache licensing, the restrictions imposed by AGPL make it non-free
[22:35:01] <ljharb> yup
[22:35:22] <sheetjs> to those that use GPL or AGPL, the permissive licenses allow for downstream behaviors that are non-free
[22:35:53] <matsaman> either you (attempt to) guarantee the source remains open & usable, or you don't
[22:36:10] <matsaman> and then the other side is
[22:36:13] <sheetjs> hence "irreconcilable" they are two fundamentally different views
[22:36:23] <matsaman> either you (attempt to) guarantee companies can close source things for "profit" reasons, or you don't
[22:36:38] <sheetjs> or you just use a proprietary license to begin with
[22:36:55] <matsaman> I mean if your software is good enough, people will use it with any license
[22:37:01] <sheetjs> this whole discussion reeks of the "have cake and eat it too" mentality that drove the wave of relicensing the last few years
[22:37:04] <matsaman> until a competitive better licensed alternative exists
[22:37:36] <matsaman> relicensing to non-GPL-like?
[22:37:52] <matsaman> I wonder if that's more common in JS land. I have heard it in other circles.
[22:37:56] <sheetjs> grafana used to be apache 2.0 (permissive) and switched to AGPL (copyleft)
[22:38:02] <matsaman> ah, very wise
[22:38:10] <sheetjs> the entire popularity was driven by the permissive nature of the project
[22:38:23] <matsaman> so people don't use grafana now?
[22:38:27] <sheetjs> having achieved popularity and real-world experience, they switched
[22:38:33] <sheetjs> its a classic bait and switch
[22:38:42] <matsaman> it does work better that way
[22:38:47] <sheetjs> they know developers won't be able to move to an alternative overnight
[22:38:48] <matsaman> rather than trying to un-GPL something
[22:39:00] <sheetjs> that hurts the entire open source community
[22:39:10] <matsaman> betrayal does hurt, everyone
[22:39:17] <sheetjs> on multiple levels
[22:39:33] <matsaman> I don't like big changes in things I'm already committed to
[22:39:33] <sheetjs> every cash grab like that diminishes trust in the rest of the community
[22:39:39] <ljharb> matsaman: if you attempt to guarantee that, you're restricting the freedom of your consumers
[22:39:39] <matsaman> which is why I seek out things using licenses I like
[22:39:47] <ljharb> matsaman: which is the very fascist behavior stallman was attempting to stop
[22:39:53] <matsaman> and the license I like is one that makes the software stay that way forever
[22:40:10] <sheetjs> mongdb switched from AGPL to SSPL
[22:40:14] <matsaman> I see your argument, but it's merely guaranteeing the software is open
[22:40:17] <sheetjs> so its not like AGPL is any real protection from relicensing
[22:40:19] <Alexendoo> grafana has a CLA, they could go proprietary tomorrow
[22:40:26] <matsaman> an individual can always license their own software however they like
[22:40:34] <sheetjs> even if they didn't, they could change license Alexendoo
[22:40:54] <matsaman> but the existing AGPL versions could be forked
[22:40:56] <Alexendoo> Yeah proprietary just being an extreme example
[22:41:11] <matsaman> there is definitely a fine line, though
[22:41:21] <matsaman> mysql had a good license

[22:47:18] <matsaman> why though, all you have to do is publish the changes, no?
[22:47:39] <ljharb> there is a lot of fear about being accidentally forced to publish company secrets simply by using copyleft sotware

[22:49:44] <matsaman> I wonder what the last thing I replaced was...
[22:49:59] <matsaman> ljharb: yes =) if I want to maintain it myself =D
[22:50:04] <ljharb> matsaman: so if you're replacing something, it's because the *world* changed and that makes that software no longer appropriate
[22:50:06] <ljharb> matsaman: YES exactly
[22:50:11] <matsaman> at which point I could just write all my own software 'cause I have so much time, ha
[22:50:19] <ljharb> matsaman: and guess what gets the most maintenance? things with the most usage. which aren't ever going to be the GPL projects at this point.
[22:50:33] <ljharb> only the legacy ones from the Before Times where GPL was a beneficial choice
[22:50:51] <ljharb> plus probably a few hipster projects through the years that pick GPL and succeed despite that
[22:50:52] <matsaman> I appreciate your definition of usage, as "downloads" and inclusions, but
[22:50:55] <matsaman> it's a tough comparison
[22:50:55] <shan> uh oh looks like i missed a large chunk of good conversation
[22:51:07] <shan> MIT is my preferred license
[22:51:26] <matsaman> ljharb: so you don't think there's much in recent history that's good that was made GPL
[22:51:36] <matsaman> the 'as-is' license
[22:51:42] <matsaman> is a nice disclaimer
[22:52:11] <matsaman> okay how about
[22:52:21] <matsaman> ljharb: how do you feel about dual licensed permissive and copyleft
[22:53:00] <ljharb> matsaman: totally fine but also totally useless from the perspective of copyleft goals
[22:53:10] <ljharb> because consumers can retroactively just pick whichever license they like
[22:53:30] <matsaman> I agree it could be counteractive
[22:53:44] <ljharb> but yeah go for it
[22:53:54] <matsaman> it's kind of a gamble
[22:53:59] <ljharb> you'll get usage because reasonable people will pick the permissive one, and you'll get to feel happy because zealots will pick the copyleft one
[22:54:04] <matsaman> you abanondon your software, which license do people choose to keep it going
[22:54:16] <ljharb> the only thing you won't achieve is oppressing your users by restricting their freedoms, but that's the point of copyleft
[22:54:21] <matsaman> mmm, I think it's responsible to have software that remains open =)
[22:54:35] <matsaman> heh, it's an interesting way to put it
[22:54:35] <ljharb> MIT is just as open as GPL
[22:54:43] <matsaman> but the point is to keep the software available
[22:54:45] <ljharb> it's only *derivative works* where the difference comes into play.
[22:54:57] <ljharb> for the project itself, the software is precisely as available with either license.
[22:55:02] <matsaman> and those do come into play
[22:55:25] <ljharb> the existence of derivative works does not affect the existence of the original work
[22:55:59] <matsaman> no
[22:56:01] <matsaman> it does not
[22:56:09] <ljharb> unless you're the MPAA or RIAA
[22:56:13] <matsaman> what matters is which version is maintained
[22:56:15] <ljharb> right
[22:56:27] <matsaman> I mean, what can matter is*
[22:56:29] <ljharb> and GPL software doesn't dictate that
[22:56:36] <ljharb> because no licenses control who maintains what
[22:56:38] <matsaman> if one version becomes very popular and modified, etc.
[22:56:44] <matsaman> mmm
[22:56:57] <matsaman> I mean it doesn't except in as much as people prefer licenses, hence the conversation, yes
[22:57:05] <ljharb> and *objectively*, because that's what has actually happened many times, the version that will become more popular and modified etc is likely to be the permissive one
[22:57:09] <sheetjs> matsaman: the general trend of projects achieving popularity with a permissive license then switching to a copyleft license should hint at a few thingsw
[22:57:13] <matsaman> ljharb: for example?
[22:57:27] <matsaman> sheetjs: that is interesting
[22:57:29] <ljharb> matsaman: i mean, there was a thing earlier this year about a gem in rails, mimemagic
[22:57:43] <ljharb> matsaman: it accidentally depended on GPL, and had to change license
[22:57:48] <matsaman> to GPL?
[22:57:50] <ljharb> yes
[22:57:56] <ljharb> guess which gem instantly lost its millions of downloads when rails removed it

[22:58:05] <matsaman> what'd rails move to?
[22:58:12] <ljharb> some MIT replacement
[22:58:20] <ljharb> and also which companies immediately froze on the last non-GPL version out of fear of being forced to publish their software
[22:58:23] <matsaman> but rails is MIT, so that just makes sense
[22:58:30] <ljharb> iow, mimemagic switching to GPL was a legal emergency worldwide
[22:58:33] <matsaman> the same thing happens from top down with GPL things
[22:58:38] <ljharb> and the effect is "mimemagic is dead"
[22:58:45] <matsaman> I don't think anyone is disputing that there are two camps and they prefer their own sides
[22:58:55] <ljharb> rails didn't care that it was gpl. rails USERS did.
[22:59:04] <matsaman> because rails was MIT, right?
[22:59:07] <ljharb> no
[22:59:20] <matsaman> the rails users cared without regard for rails being MIT?
[22:59:22] <ljharb> because rails' users don't want GPL in their applications. because it encumbers their projects by adding restrictions.
[22:59:36] <matsaman> which is indicated by their choice of rails which is MIT top to bottom?
[22:59:38] <ljharb> i mean, rails being MIT makes it a viable choice in the first place for those apps, sure
[22:59:43] <ljharb> but no, rails is not MIT top to bottopm
[22:59:47] <ljharb> it's just not copyleft anywhere
[22:59:56] <ljharb> because "copyleft" is a poison pill. which is the point.
[23:00:02] <matsaman> okay, not copyleft, then
[23:00:22] <matsaman> I'm not sure a single outlier being replaced to match is particularly enlightening

[23:00:29] <matsaman> pretty sure that happens on the mostly-GPL side of things, too

[23:00:41] <ljharb> sure
[23:00:47] <sheetjs> https://github.com/mimemagicrb/mimemagic/issues/97
[23:00:50] <matsaman> I think the libraries/framework side of this is hard
[23:00:55] <ljharb> but it's about license compatibility
[23:00:58] <ljharb> not "matching"
[23:00:59] <matsaman> actual end user apps would be easier to debate I think
[23:01:03] <ljharb> sure, agreed
[23:01:13] <ljharb> because end users don't give the slightest shit about the license on the things they use. only the cost.
[23:01:21] <matsaman> certainly many =)
[23:01:23] <ljharb> scroll to bottom, click agree

[23:04:49] <ljharb> open source definitely won. it's just a pyrrhic victory
[23:04:55] <sheetjs> the sheer number of projects removing open source alternatives is arguably evidence of a loss

[23:05:24] <GreenJello> teut, empty arrays are truthy, and the array is always empty at that point
[23:05:26] <matsaman> in the JS world in particular, things come and go so fast

[23:06:35] <teut> I mean ok I understand that during rerender , images becomes []  again
[23:06:46] <sheetjs> yes its a lot ljharb, you probably only pay attention to the really large examples
[23:06:53] <ljharb> and the ecosystem of "excel spreadsheets" is not exactly a broad generically applicable use case
[23:06:53] <teut> so what can be done to avoid image loading time?
