[04:35:39] <mats1> well, that owes more to technological advancement empowering governments
[04:36:00] <catbeard> you can't even get ON the plane without rudimentary identification/screening
[04:36:08] <catbeard> unless you're flying the plane LOL

[04:37:26] <Joanna> I remember an argument with this with a sheeple back when it first started and the idiot said oh what’s the big deal I can just show my work ID at airport. I told them you have less freedom that ten years ago and in ten years you will have less freedom that you do now!
[04:37:54] <catbeard> well yeah that needs separate identification than just a driver's license, you need a secret clearance and a SIDA badge for that airport
[04:38:06] <Joanna> catbeard: that wouldn’t work and you know it.
[04:38:41] <Joanna> If you want freedom you need a private plane and enter airport through a different entrance.

[04:39:54] <Joanna> People who work there still know eachother don’t they ?
[04:40:15] <catbeard> crew doesn't need to be notified of pilot change, that's an ops problem, thought they're free to call the tower and confirm the pilot change

[04:44:48] <Joanna> I bet airlines get paid a lot for the data harvesting
[04:45:08] <catbeard> you might be able to end up in the pilot's seat at best, but they'll walk ident you until you can prove you're there to execute a valid route
