[03:16:28] <Torr> Dagmar: I don't want to EFI boot. I've installed the boot loader on the premise this machine is BIOS booting, since I just toggled that option on the BIOS menu.
[03:16:44] <Dagmar> blackgatonegro: Patching in a hurry has never been Microsoft's strong suit.  Their first line of defense is generally to add a hook that looks explicitly for packets generated by the PoC

[07:45:35] <Dagmar> Tcpdump has much of the same.  It's mainly a matter of just letting it do it's "thang"

[07:49:33] <hodapp> two things I've used Wireshark for with no problem
[07:49:42] <knowmadic> wireshark decoding and protocol dissection is far better imo
[07:50:08] <hodapp> nor am I aware of tcpdump having any sort of interactive processing of packet dumps, with e.g. things like 'Follow TCP' that are huge time-savers
[07:50:49] <hodapp> yeah, it has been excellent with protocol dissection when I've used it for that
[07:51:56] <hodapp> so it's a bit asinine to go "Wireshark is so idiots can pretend to understand what they're doing" when it's used for various tasks that tcpdump neither does nor even pretends to do

[11:02:11] <gebbione> hi folks, i would like to run npm or other build commands and the main problem is loading credentials ... ie .npmrc file with tokens , .known_hosts etc ... Is there a way to add files outside the context ... ie ADD in Dockerfile from ~/.ssh for instance? As at the moment i am getting some permission errors and i need to find a way to include these files without mounting them

[11:09:39] <gebbione> Czernobog, not sure about thunar but on ubuntu it is the same for network drives ... even if you specify to remember the password ... it will not remember it and you need to put it again. Maybe you can mount the external drive with a script that has your password

[16:15:19] <angular_mike_> doesnt work
[16:15:52] <curdlesnoot> anyway, the official channel is at OFTC, according to the channel's topic.
[16:16:09] <angular_mike_> anyone is able to get into the channel on oftc?
[16:16:11] <longxia> angular_mike_: maybe your irc client works differently. Or you put a space in front of it, or you should look in your status window.

[16:29:54] <MrElendig> its normal in 2021
[16:29:55] <curdlesnoot> I wouldn't use a web-based client to begin with
[16:30:23] <curdlesnoot> it's for casuals, I suppose.
[16:30:24] <Guest2183> this is a foss network so it is not normal to fingerprint users lol

[16:46:06] <curdlesnoot> that's a fair question. why? you ask for "downloading same file" then seem confused that it would require downloading segments thereof to even work.
[16:46:16] <curdlesnoot> one file, two+ connections - you figure it out.
[16:46:38] <curdlesnoot> I don't think that's a feature in hot demand.
[16:46:59] <djph> seems to work for bittorrent
[16:47:31] <curdlesnoot> sure, but the protocol is designed from the ground up to revolve around the principle. not so much for http.

[20:27:51] <sys64738> /sys/class/spidev either, so its not a udev issue). do i need some extra code to make spidev bind to my driver (im not seeing any in other modules' sources?), or is there something else im missing?

[22:16:06] *** Quits: newtoliberachat (~xyz@210.18.180.63) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[22:16:12] <msiism> I see. I had heard about reiserfs being efficient for loads of small files. I generally use ext, though, and I'm very pleased with it.
[22:16:35] <phogg> jim: I do not know, but I believe the answer is no
[22:16:46] *** Joins: Jefren (~Jefren@70.35.67.145)
[22:17:02] <phogg> jim: you can store up to two: one that consumes part of the block from the start, the other of which consumes part of the block from the end
[22:17:15] *** Joins: redruM (~redrum@user/redrum)
[22:18:05] <jim> so, one file starting at the start of a block, the second file from byte 30 or 31, and you'd have an unused part, (blocksize) - 30 * 2
[22:18:11] <phogg> msiism: reiserfs3 is more space efficient for sure, but it can also be a lot faster for a large number of files. This got a lot better with ext3, as I recall, and by now the difference is probably not too important.
[22:18:13] <xiaomiao> msiism: ext4 has a weakness with lots of small files: the number of inodes is statically set at mkfs time, so you can run out of inodes -  a problem that for  example XFS doesn't have

[22:19:17] <phogg> the reality is that we should probably all just be using XFS for everything. There aren't many reasons not to any more

[22:23:24] <koollman_> phogg: and, if you handle file-level duplication ... well, you're doing some type of raid. But it's not the same kind of raid that the lower level would do
[22:23:38] *** Joins: bilb_ono (~alexmarsh@12.190.239.194)
[22:23:42] <msiism> paulcarroty: Why would that be?
[22:23:48] <phogg> koollman_: deduplication can be done layered. File level checksum definitely belongs at the FS layer, no trouble there.
[22:24:14] <koollman_> and that lower level couldn't do it in general in linux, it would need pretty tight integration with which blocks are used and freed at all time
[22:25:12] <phogg> I agree that it's a much harder problem
[22:25:20] *** Joins: knowmadic (~ryan@user/knowmadic)
[22:25:29] <phogg> but that way lies perfection, the other way is only of short-term benefit.
[22:25:34] <koollman_> for compression, it's much easier to do when you aren't handling 'anonymous blocks' but actual 'stream of bytes', if you want to handle writes
[22:26:20] <koollman_> (because... where do you store metadata and handle rewrites of some blocks that change size, if you aren't in the filesystem logic but in a block layer algorithm ?)
[22:26:26] <hexnewbie> msiism: Not sure for paulcarroty's reasons, but before nftables maps/sets, ipsets for iptables, and the like, thousands of sequential iptables rules used to be very slow. Never got proficient with FreeBSD's firewall, but my impression was that this wasn't a problem (and I think was a deciding factor for all ISPs in the country to switch away from Linux, my former employer stopped
[22:26:32] <hexnewbie> having the mentioned issue after switching to FreeBSD)
[22:26:42] <koollman_> same goes for things like reflink, which is how btrfs or xfs handle duplication

[22:28:59] <phogg> koollman_: I believe it's closer to the "almost impossible" side. Still the right way of doing business.
[22:29:46] <phogg> I'm content to get what I can out of xfs or ext on top of regular Linux block layer stuff. Anything that can't be done that way is a mortal sin.
[22:29:48] <msiism> hexnewbie: I mean, I'm seriously considering to switch my laptop to OpenBSD, mosty because GNU userspace tools are such a mess. That's why I was asking.
[22:29:49] <koollman_> sure. But then ... I don't feel like saying 'this is not the way to do it' knowing the other way might never work. And at some point, if you want to use any of those features, choices are pretty limited

[22:46:59] <jim> MrMobius, and comment it out when you get tired of it :)
[22:47:02] <hexnewbie> For the VFS to whitelist sane characters, it would have to parse UTF-8. ext4 does that now for the purposes of case insensitive, but not by default.
[22:47:15] <Dagmar> The moment you attempt to fix what is essentially another form of in-band signaling by excluding certain characters, you have started down the road to Dismal Failure.
[22:47:22] <phogg> hexnewbie: case insensitivity was a terrible idea )-:
[22:47:29] <curdlesnoot> MrMobius: for a script, a "non-interactive" instance of the shell is spawned.

[22:47:54] <phogg> Dagmar: in principle I agree, however in this specific case the benefits far outweigh the risks
[22:48:06] <Dagmar> ...and excluding newlines befcause it causes problems for garbagecode is very much an in-band signaling problem.
[22:48:08] <hexnewbie> Non-breaking space, let alone rtl override characters, are way worse in filenames than newlines, and to disallow them you need to parse UTF-8.
[22:48:10] <MrMobius> jim, maybe good to leave it in until i figure things out :P
[22:48:36] <Dagmar> No, the benefits cannot outweigh the risks because the risks are essentially guarantees.
[22:48:44] <phogg> hexnewbie: they're not worse because shells don't have them in IFS
[22:48:54] <Dagmar> It's not a "risk".  It's a "will happen".

[23:47:57] <Dagmar> ...all they need is for something to be undefined, and you're off to the races
[23:48:23] <jim> unless you fail to define races :)
[23:48:54] <Dagmar> I'm not really willing to trust an external knowledge of how the strings work, because that smells remarkably like casually ignoring byte-order and inet_ntoa functions, "becuause it's just a long integer"
[23:49:15] <Dagmar> "...and everyone knows all long integers are the same"

[23:55:48] <Dagmar> ...and are always least-significant bits first, right?

[23:56:59] <phogg> which spec thing?
[23:57:04] <Dagmar> I wasn't trying to pose some hypothetical speedbump
[23:57:17] <Dagmar> Whether or not the spec that defines regular expressions mandates beginning the search from the left
[23:57:58] <Dagmar> It _feels_ like the sort of thing someone writing a spec might deliberately leave out to avoid being ethniocentric, with a side order of "anyone who assumes this gets what they deserve"

[23:58:30] <phogg> Dagmar: I would home so
[23:58:32] <Dagmar> Like how POSIX is conspiciously "silent" on whether or not having usernames that are just numbers is f**king stupid
[23:58:56] <phogg> In theory it could be allowed. In practice it's unpleasant.
[23:59:09] <Dagmar> In practice it's dumb
[23:59:11] *** Quits: jean (~jean@user/jean) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[23:59:23] <phogg> many things in POSIX are unfortunately "read between the lines" stuff, rather than "for clarity we will spell it out for you"

[23:59:48] <phogg> as a consequence of X and Y, don't do Z. But we won't tell you the Z part.
[23:59:53] <Dagmar> I think that one is just a amtter of it being dumb
