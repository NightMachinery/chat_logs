[06:19:34] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[06:19:36] * Sadale licks MootPoot :3
[06:19:46] <Sxem> my steam feed had the usual stupidity of ppl and groups giving away a bunch of steam keys by just pasting it into their feed and they all disappear in seconds to bots who never say thank you
[06:20:28] <Sadale> Why'd a bot do that?
[06:20:40] <Sadale> It isn't like that you can resell the game after redeeming the code
[06:22:03] <Sxem> they farm cards?
[06:22:26] <Sxem> theres no limit on steam accounts, so you can get millions of accounts each with many games giving you steam wallet
[06:23:02] <Sxem> then you get boosters
[06:23:28] <Sxem> also each day they give you 4 cents for a xmas card. times that by a million
[06:23:58] <Sxem> they want to hoard games
[06:24:22] <Sxem> the most valuable they probably try to use on their main account
[06:24:34] <Sxem> or they can sell the accounts
[06:24:45] <Sxem> each with a ton of games
[06:25:47] <Sadale> ah
[06:33:20] <Sadale> As for selling the accounts tho that sounds like a lot of work with barely any return. I wouldn't want to purchase a steam account unless it's very cheap with literally tons and tons of games
[06:39:37] *** Quits: Arcorann__ (~A@159-196-65-46.9fc441.mel.nbn.aussiebb.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:41:06] <Sxem> its all automated, takes almost no work
[06:41:33] <Sxem> i guess they had to program the bots first
[06:41:36] <Sadale> The point is that how much would an account even sell?
[06:41:39] <Sxem> but after that, its easy money
[06:41:50] <Sadale> Considered the amount of work to make a bot like that, I'm not sure if that'd actually be worth the efforts.
[06:42:00] <Sxem> maybe
[06:42:18] <Sadale> IMO I definitely wouldn't want to purchase this kind of accounts. I'm not sure if I'm dealing with a scammer. :/
[06:42:20] <Sxem> every time i see someone post keys, someone soon says theyre all gone, must be bots
[06:42:33] <Sadale> makes sense. Must be bots.
[06:42:42] <Sxem> maybe theyre trying to make everyone give up so they can get them all
[06:42:55] <Sadale> lol
[06:42:59] <Sxem> the few times ive checked, theyve always been all gone tho
[06:43:17] <Sadale> put it inside a pic. Then rot13 it
[06:43:26] <Sadale> Use a format that the bots don't understand.

[09:46:12] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: A slur is a symbol in Western musical notation indicating that the notes it embraces are to be played without separation. A slur is denoted with a curved line generally placed over the notes if the stems point downward, and under them if the stems point upwards.
[09:46:39] <ButterNoodle> apparently "lets go brandon" is now a slur
[09:46:52] <ButterNoodle> how does one play that on the claripenis
[09:48:42] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: when you do beat saber
[09:48:51] <MootPoot> do you like wrist flick, or arm flick
[09:49:02] <ButterNoodle> wrist
[09:49:07] <MootPoot> I seem to hit blocks but it gets registered as a incorrect direction
[09:49:18] <ButterNoodle> move the arm to get close then flick
[09:49:35] <ButterNoodle> I get noregs on fast stuff
[09:49:38] <ButterNoodle> I have to slow dow
[09:49:40] <ButterNoodle> *down
[09:49:44] <MootPoot> hmm
[09:49:45] <MootPoot> okay
[09:49:56] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981 said the cv1 only tracks at 30fps
[09:50:13] <MootPoot> I cant seem to like do more then 3 blocks/s in the rate counter
[09:50:19] <ButterNoodle> that why the slower arm movements to the block, followed by the wrist flick work ok
[09:50:21] <MootPoot> moving from hard to very hard is impossible
[09:50:35] <MootPoot> I wonder how fast the quest 2 tracks
[09:50:42] <ButterNoodle> could be the tracking
[09:50:52] <ButterNoodle> u using the oculus tray tool?

[09:51:26] <MootPoot> oh god
[09:51:48] <MootPoot> side switches are the worst as well
[09:51:59] <MootPoot> when they want you to do both on one side together
[09:52:01] <ButterNoodle> I restarted 2x before I could rewire my brain
[09:52:07] <MootPoot> but they swap the order so you have to swap your arms
[09:52:23] <ButterNoodle> jumping blocks
[09:52:32] <MootPoot> cross your arms*
[09:52:41] <ButterNoodle> I'm ok tracking that stuff
[09:52:53] <MootPoot> like if both are on the right - left arm goes for the lower block and right for the higher
[09:52:56] <MootPoot> but sometimes they swap it
[09:52:58] <MootPoot> jfc
[09:53:06] <ButterNoodle> but purposely crossing them in a way that ur gonna mash ur hands into each other
[09:53:19] <ButterNoodle> there are some songs that its intentional
[09:53:56] <MootPoot> gonna need more practice or something to exceed 3 blocks /s
[09:54:00] <ButterNoodle> I see them coming now, and just take the miss
[09:54:09] <MootPoot> 2.8 or 2.9 is the highest I can do 
[09:54:21] <MootPoot> I dont know how people do those songs with like 12/s
[09:54:21] <ButterNoodle> check out the oculus tray tool
[09:54:29] <ButterNoodle> u may need to disable asw
[09:54:37] <ButterNoodle> I think thats what its called...

[13:44:15] <amigojapan> Like in the anime girls last tour
[13:44:55] <MootPoot> I still have to watch that
[13:45:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I consider that a modern classic
[13:45:46] <amigojapan> I have already rewatched it
[13:46:07] <MootPoot> ugh - one more week till I get my new monitor
[13:46:16] <MootPoot> for some reason all the lights on my house are yellow
[13:46:23] <MootPoot> I dont like yellow light
[13:46:36] <amigojapan> You like white?
[13:46:43] <amigojapan> That's weird
[13:46:44] <MootPoot> I prefer white light
[13:47:00] <amigojapan> Yellow light is warmer
[13:47:05] <MootPoot> I know
[13:47:23] <MootPoot> I dont really like it that much - it impairs my abilities
[13:50:06] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:50:39] <MootPoot> I either work/ do stuff or sleep
[13:50:45] <MootPoot> I sometimes use colored light
[13:50:50] <MootPoot> like red or neon etc
[13:53:30] <amigojapan> !memo Jigsy seems they found sayaka kanda's suicide note. It seems she had forced a guy to write a written promise that he would not meet his previous girlfriend. But the guy did not have the guts to brake up with her. So she killed herself...

[14:04:08] <S_T_A_N> yeah
[14:05:55] <amigojapan> She was*
[14:11:35] <MootPoot> I just bought a mug
[14:13:15] <amigojapan> Hands up MootPoot ! This is your mug
[14:13:27] <MootPoot> no!
[14:13:46] <MootPoot> amigojapan: guess  how much the mug was
[14:14:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: dunno 12.99?
[14:14:34] <MootPoot> no
[14:14:42] <MootPoot> you're going to call me a consumerist for this one :3
[14:14:56] <amigojapan> I see
[14:14:58] <MootPoot> it was 150 dollars
[14:15:05] <amigojapan> Wow
[14:15:18] <MootPoot> although its a present - not for me
[14:15:40] <amigojapan> Still too much
[14:15:49] <MootPoot> its a mug that is battery powered
[14:15:52] <MootPoot> keeps your drink warm

[14:16:10] <amigojapan> Buy a thermos mug
[14:16:19] <MootPoot> but its a present for family so 
[14:16:26] <MootPoot> price is not really a concern
[14:18:03] <amigojapan> I see
[14:18:26] <MootPoot> the problem is the person likes tech, but also he dosent use anything that dosent fit with his habits
[14:18:34] <amigojapan> It also sounds like a novelty
[14:18:37] <MootPoot> it is
[14:18:46] <MootPoot> its a luxury item really
[14:19:11] <amigojapan> You would need to feed it a lot of batteries
[14:19:21] <MootPoot> it has a battery in it
[14:19:32] <MootPoot> and a plate on your desk which it charges wirelessly from
[14:19:47] <amigojapan> I see
[14:19:58] <MootPoot> its hard to gift things as an adult
[14:20:20] <amigojapan> Yup
[14:20:33] <MootPoot> you either need to gift stuff which they dont know about, or is too much of a luxury or extra expendeture that they could just get it themselves
[14:20:43] <MootPoot> of which this mug is the second category
[14:21:10] <MootPoot> nobody would get it for themselves, but I think most people who drink tea/coffee regularly would use it regularly if they had one but just cant justify the price
[14:21:47] <MootPoot> hard to gift something to somebody who already can buy most of what they want
[14:21:54] *** Joins: DarkSune (~DarkSune@152.207.246.90)

[14:22:18] <amigojapan> It can be something they would get

[14:23:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: some of that trash taste mercy looks good
[14:23:21] <amigojapan> Yes MootPoot 
[14:23:35] <MootPoot> but you would not get it yourself with your own money right?

[14:23:44] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.116)

[14:24:04] <MootPoot> to rationalize the purchage
[14:24:06] <amigojapan> No you are over thinking it
[14:24:07] <MootPoot> purchase
[14:24:13] <MootPoot> hmmm
[14:24:52] <amigojapan> Even an Amazon gift card is a good gift
[14:25:14] <MootPoot> so if you had to give somebody a gift ( somebody who already makes enough money to buy basically everything they want ) what would you do
[14:25:19] <MootPoot> just give them more money?
[14:25:40] <amigojapan> Give them some food
[14:25:52] <MootPoot> even if they can just get all the food they want
[14:26:01] <amigojapan> Yes
[14:26:15] <MootPoot> so you'd just be giving more of the thing they already have enough of?
[14:26:32] <amigojapan> So what
[14:26:43] <MootPoot> idk - it sounds generic to me
[14:26:58] <MootPoot> like you didnt take the time to think what they actually wanted/needed/could appreciate
[14:27:16] <MootPoot> but you do live in japan with the omiyagai culture

[15:55:59] <Satin> Sadale: yeah
[15:56:06] <amigojapan> I have heard people complain about feminists before
[15:56:26] <Satin> amigojapan: yeah but these feminists are the "radical" ones who exclude trans people as being valid
[15:56:34] <Satin> trans women aren't women to them
[15:56:56] <amigojapan> I see
[15:57:03] <Sadale> I honestly don't give a fuck.
[15:57:11] <Satin> most of the LGBTQ and feminist communities don't support TERFs
[15:57:17] <Satin> but...
[15:57:18] <Satin> yeah...
[15:57:24] <Satin> a lot of UK feminists seem to be TERFs
[15:57:30] <Satin> and so on
[15:57:44] <Sadale> I just find it annoying that people keep disagreeing with each others. And this LGBT thingie is very disagreement-stiring. Anyway this shit has been going on for years :/
[15:57:46] <amigojapan> I was not familiar with them
[15:58:13] <Satin> Sadale: it's disagreement stirring but it's an important aspect of trans rights being supported or not
[15:58:43] <Sadale> Satin, not my problem. I'm not a trans. Not that I'm opposed to trans right. But it isn't my problem.
[15:58:56] <Satin> ye i'm not saying you have to care
[15:59:00] <Satin> it's just what it is
[15:59:11] <Satin> as someone who cares about the LGBTQ community a little bit

[16:55:30] <MootPoot> tbh with headphones the thing is 
[16:55:39] <MootPoot> after you hit like 100-130

[18:45:25] <ezekielnoob> my bedroom AC is always on
[18:45:28] <Terminus> ezekielnoob: that $400 was when the economy was very different. you're talking about your mom, not yourself.
[18:45:47] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, I dunno. I have a feeling that airconditioning would be the major thing that I'd have to give up to save money in case I run out of retirement fund..
[18:46:03] <ezekielnoob> Terminus obviously thigns are relative
[18:46:05] <Terminus> that's like the people who say you only deserve a $600/mo salary because that's what they had back in 1995. the economy in 1995 is very different from the economy of 2021.
[18:46:07] <ezekielnoob> it depends on how good u want it
[18:46:28] <ezekielnoob> Terminus im only comparing 10 years ago vs today

[18:46:54] <ButterNoodle> woha
[18:46:56] <Sadale> ok. Let's say that inflation has made the living cost doubled over these 10 years. That'd only make $800.

[18:47:50] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, What about housing tho? Does your family own the apartment>?
[18:48:00] <ezekielnoob> we bought a house
[18:48:04] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, oh I'm talking about retirment. By the time I retire I wouldn't have any income.
[18:48:15] <Sadale> I see. So $400 doesn't include rent.
[18:48:23] <ezekielnoob> this is a hard topic for me cause i don't really know how the numbers really
[18:48:32] <Sadale> I see. :3
[18:48:45] <ezekielnoob> how much is your budget anyway
[18:48:47] <Sadale> No worries. I could ask again later when I'm getting closer to retire xD
[18:48:47] <beaky> new house omedetou
[18:48:59] <Terminus> ezekielnoob: still though. 2 years ago, i could buy 1 kg of ground beef for $5. today, it's $10/kg.
[18:49:05] <ezekielnoob> Terminus it's a crappy lifestyle tho
[18:49:10] <ezekielnoob> for a $400 a month
[18:49:12] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Probably somewhere between $0.5mil to $1mil by the time I retire.
[18:49:21] <ezekielnoob> you're right tho Terminus
[18:49:23] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, for surviving 20 years.
[18:49:28] <ButterNoodle> ig I need to update :|
[18:49:32] <ezekielnoob> but salaries didn't double in 10 years unfortunately
[18:49:56] <ButterNoodle> 20 years
[18:50:17] <ezekielnoob> i just know a lot of people who have families that only make 1/5 of my month
[18:50:20] <ezekielnoob> and just go by
[18:50:25] <Terminus> Sadale: put in index stocks and convert to cash only the earnings. if you have $1M, 5% is $50k/year which is pretty comfortable.
[18:50:27] <ezekielnoob> but obviously you just don't go by

[18:54:22] <Sadale> , which I don't have :'(
[18:55:00] <Terminus> Sadale: anyway, $1k/mo can still be doable in the provinces. $300 for rent, $200 for groceries. that's if you're alone.
[18:55:00] <ButterNoodle> *Till 69
[18:55:16] <Sadale> Terminus, I see. nice! :3
[18:55:19] <Terminus> i was gonna say my groceries are $400 but then i realized it's groceries for 2. 🤣
[18:55:39] <Sadale> Terminus, ah. If my imouto's joining tho that'd be $400 to me
[18:56:12] <Sadale> Says I could survive at $600 a month at PH. Assuming no inflation, it'd take $4700 a year. hmm.
[18:56:26] <Sadale> Actually that isn't too bad. But it assumes no inflation.
[18:56:31] <Terminus> one reason i stay in manila is because hardware is easier to buy though. more parts in stock at stores. everything i want becomes a special order in the provinces.
[18:56:41] <Terminus> although there's online shopping now...
[18:57:02] <Sadale> I could just take a flight to HK and buy the hardware if I ever have to get back to HK for whatever reason xD

[18:58:20] <Terminus> Sadale: surprise! that flight will cost you $400 just for plane tickets.
[18:58:22] <Sadale> Terminus, internet's $50 only. :P
[18:58:25] <ezekielnoob> yeah i'd say $600 is kinda crap
[18:58:47] <ezekielnoob> u can always be frugal but yeah
[18:58:53] <Sadale> What kind of airconditioner do you guys use there? Does each of the room have their own A/C?
[18:59:15] <Sadale> Or do you guys have a centralized A/C system for the entire home?
[18:59:22] <ezekielnoob> i use inverter type ACs, helps save a bit more
[18:59:25] <Sadale> Here most home uses an A/C per home.
[18:59:29] <Sadale> nice!
[18:59:32] <ezekielnoob> my bedroom/office has AC 24/7
[18:59:34] <ezekielnoob> almost
[18:59:39] <ezekielnoob> maybe 90% uptime
[18:59:39] <Terminus> Sadale: yeah, each room has one. i have a 1 KW aircon but in hindsight, 1.5 KW would have been better. my aircon runs at 100% during the summer.
[18:59:56] <Sadale> Terminus, I see :3
[19:00:15] <Sadale> Terminus, how much is electricity cost there?
[19:00:20] <Terminus> it's better to buy a bigger one and have it actually switch on and off.
[19:00:22] <ezekielnoob> and youre gonna need it haha
[19:00:30] <ezekielnoob> summer heat here is fucking nasty
[19:00:37] <Sadale> Here it's like $0.2 per kwh
[19:00:41] <Terminus> Sadale: electricity is expensive $0.2/KWh
[19:00:48] <Sadale> oh the same
[19:00:52] <Terminus> oh, it's the same lol
[19:01:08] <Terminus> provinces can be more expensive. can go as high as $0.25/KWh

[19:01:19] <Terminus> depends on where you are. it can go cheaper too.
[19:01:20] <Sadale> so 1kw * 24 * 30 *0.2 would be $144 per month
[19:01:36] <Sadale> Terminus, What did you mean by provinces tho?
[19:01:42] <Sadale> like outside of the city?
[19:01:46] <ezekielnoob> yeah
[19:01:53] <ezekielnoob> the cost is different
[19:03:01] <Terminus> Sadale: sounds about right. for reference, my electricity is ~$170 for a 5 bedroom house. but it's only me, my gf, and our housekeeper living here. add more people and it'll go up to ~$250.
[19:04:36] <Sadale> 5 bedrooms O_o
[19:04:37] <Terminus> Sadale: as far as real estate goes, it's ~$1k/m^2 in my area. but that's manila prices. manila's getting quite expensive.
[19:04:37] <ezekielnoob> we kinda have similar expenses Terminus
[19:04:39] <ezekielnoob> from what i see
[19:04:47] <Sadale> Terminus, you rich.
[19:04:57] <Sadale> and you even got a housekeeper
[19:05:12] <Sadale> no wonder why you said $1200
[19:05:33] <ezekielnoob> it's good to have different ranges Sadale regardless
[19:05:39] <Sadale> true

[19:05:58] <Sadale> yep. I do need more data
[19:06:08] <ezekielnoob> that's why i said it's lower since i know personally a lot of people who make a lot less than i do

[19:07:51] <Sadale> oh actually I make a bit more than that pre-tax.
[19:08:03] <Sadale> but the living cost here's differentr

[19:08:45] * Sadale lazy lazy
[19:09:45] <Sadale> do you think condo or house are better?
[19:09:56] <Sadale> AFAIK foreigners there can't purchase a house tho.
[19:10:02] <ezekielnoob> it depends IMO
[19:10:09] <ezekielnoob> there's advantages of just renting
[19:10:14] <Sadale> indeed
[19:10:18] <ezekielnoob> if u don't move a lot
[19:10:18] <Sadale> renting is an option as well
[19:10:23] <ezekielnoob> then house might be better
[19:10:28] <ezekielnoob> cause houses are hard to get rid of
[19:10:36] <Sadale> oh
[19:10:51] <Sadale> Funny. And house are actually cheaper than condo
[19:11:22] <Sadale> Perhaps house are actually better if I could purchase it
[19:11:24] <Terminus> Sadale: yes, foreigners can't own land specifically. you can draw up a long term lease though.
[19:11:42] <Sadale> Terminus, I see. Sounds like something that could be done somehow.

[19:13:12] <ezekielnoob> gotta get that insurance

[19:14:12] <Sadale> Perhaps Cebu could be safer than Manila? xD
[19:14:33] <Terminus> i lean towards steel frame with cement fiber boards for house construction. too much heat retention with rebar walls. definitely rebar walls for a perimeter wall though.

[19:16:34] <Terminus> my problem with houses is that i don't think residential engineering here has caught up with the 21st century yet.

[19:17:02] <Terminus> i think more about building than buying an existing house.
[19:17:16] <Sadale> Would buying existing house any cheaper tho?
[19:17:27] <Sadale> Since houses aren't easy to get rid of, I'm thinking if that'd be the case

[19:21:18] <MootPoot> I think my house is like I think 150
[19:21:34] <Terminus> if you have $1500, you can rent a comfy 60 m^2 condo in the very convenient financial district.
[19:22:18] <Sadale> $1500/mo is a lot
[19:22:48] <Sadale> and if it's for retirement, meh. I don't need to live in somewhere like super convenient.
[19:23:23] <Terminus> the house i'm in right now is on a 450 m^2 lot. it's definitely overkill for 2 people and a housekeeper😅
[19:23:51] <Sadale> As for renting, I think there's a problem with that. The landlord could stop leasing any time. I could end up having to switch home once every few years :/
[19:24:09] <Sadale> Terminus, Is that housekeeper of yours like serving you all of the time?
[19:24:11] <MootPoot> marry the landlord ez

[19:25:12] <Terminus> Sadale: yeah but i don't really ask much of her. just cooking food and hanging my laundry. she cleans on her own initiative. she does get vacations as well of course.
[19:26:01] <Sadale> Terminus, I see. It isn't uncommon for people here to hire Filipino maid (i.e. housekeeper) here.
[19:26:27] <Sadale> Not sure on how much they cost tho since my family doesn't hire one.
[19:26:33] <MootPoot> tbh Sadale I wonder

[19:28:56] <MootPoot> what's stopping sadale from getting run over by a truck-kun tommorow 
[19:29:05] <Sadale> MootPoot, no worries tho. It isn't that I've got the time to enjoy a large decent monitor

[19:30:04] <Sadale> Terminus, sad :-(
[19:30:43] <Sadale> Terminus, Wouldn't working as a waiter or cashier or whatever make you more than $100/mo there?
[19:30:58] <Sadale> Or even fastfood restaurant workers.
[19:31:09] <Sadale> $100/mo sounds very shit.
[19:32:48] <Terminus> Sadale: the thing is it's $100/mo with all your needs taken care of. there was this joke going around a while back about how minimum wage office workers are slaving away all stressed while the housekeeper is at home relaxing and making calls to get updates on the progress of the construction of their house.
[19:33:15] <Sadale> oh lol
[19:33:27] <Terminus> also, that $100/mo doesn't include govt mandated benefits.
[19:33:29] <Sadale> I see. True that the housekeeping isn't exactly a slave xD
[19:33:57] <Sadale> Terminus, what did you mean by "get updates on the progress of the construction of their house" tho?
[19:34:21] <Sadale> So she helped on coordinating consturction of *your* house?
[19:34:33] <Terminus> Sadale: as in the wages of the office workers evaporate while the housekeeper can already afford to have a house of their own built.
[19:34:44] <Sadale> oh

[19:35:44] <Sadale> hold on. what?
[19:35:48] <Terminus> yep.
[19:36:08] <Sadale> oh right. Since the housekeeper's need is taken care of, the $100/mo can be used fully for building a house.
[19:36:26] <Terminus> that's the joke. they can afford more because they get to save everything while the office worker has to pay bills etc. and nothing's left at the end of the month.
[19:36:31] <Sadale> I see. so if the house is $100k, it'd only take 100 months to build a house.
[19:36:45] <Sadale> sad
[19:37:08] <Terminus> oh they don't buy the $100k house. they usually go for a ~$20k house.
[19:37:14] <Sadale> oh wow
[19:37:39] <Sadale> oh I miscalculated. 100k/100 is 1000 months
[19:37:40] <Terminus> it's typically in a more rural area so cheaper.
[19:37:53] <Sadale> so 20k/100 would be 200 months.
[19:37:59] <Sadale> That'd be 16 years
[19:38:27] <Sadale> What's even is the point of building a house tho if they're living with whoever they're serving? xD
[19:39:08] <Sadale> Now that it got me into thinking, by the time I retire, if my imouto's joining me, I may very well become a house keeper for my lazy umaru imouto. xD

[19:40:59] <Sadale> Terminus, so a smaller home does have it perks. Smaller home means less space to clean and less space for doing housekeeping xD

[19:47:40] <Terminus> Sadale: the more rural the area is, the more difficult it'll be to buy things conveniently. you can't just pop over to a 7-11 and buy a bag of doritos.

[19:48:26] <Terminus> driving 100 km to buy groceries will get old quick.
[19:48:29] <Sadale> I actually expect that I'd have to learn driving after I move to elsewhere tho.
[19:48:52] <Terminus> although you don't have to live 100 km away from civilization.
[19:48:57] <Sadale> Live in a major city is pretty much different than living in a minor city or in rural area
[19:48:59] <jun> Yea, my mom's been pestering me to learn driving since forever

[19:56:56] <Terminus> Sadale: mega manila + metro cebu is probably the most expensive. outside of that, it can get cheap.
[19:57:51] <Terminus> Sadale: shit. i picked the wrong threshold. if you're living at kabankalan, you might as well live at bacolod, talisay, or silay. metro bacolod area. it'll be a whole lot more convenient while still being cheap.

[19:59:34] <Terminus> also, yes i have traveled a decent amount over the years. not recently though. i lived in cebu for a time around 15 years ago too.
[20:00:27] <Terminus> Sadale: kabankalan is a frequent stop of ours on the way to sipalay for a beach vacation.
[20:01:06] <Terminus> i've also gone to kabankalan in the morning, got drunk at a festival, then went back to bacolod in the evening.
[20:01:35] <Sadale> I see. Makes sense :3
[20:02:12] <Sadale> interesting how some of the name of the places are in Spanish
[20:02:58] <Terminus> but it's too far for covenience IMO. if you live in metro bacolod, the airport is close enough making it convenient to fly to anywhere.

[23:56:13] <Bco1981> nice
[23:56:31] <MootPoot> for some reason moving from 32" to 34" basically doubled the price
[23:56:42] <MootPoot> maybe its too odd a size
[23:56:50] <Bco1981> i gave the kids the same monitor Cryowolf bought. it's pretty good.
[23:57:05] <Cryowolf> yeah I really like it
[23:57:13] <Cryowolf> I got HDR turned on
[23:57:15] <MootPoot> which one
[23:57:24] <Cryowolf> I forgot the whole product name
[23:57:27] <Cryowolf> an LG monitor
[23:57:36] <MootPoot> very discriptive
[23:58:07] <Cryowolf> yeah well, I blame my chemo-damaged brain
[23:58:20] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: i guess the "g-sync" only works in windows 10. my daughter is on windows 7, and there is no g-sync option in the controlpanel
[23:58:28] <Bco1981> but my son on windows 10 has it.
[23:58:48] <MootPoot> is it that gn27 850 one?
