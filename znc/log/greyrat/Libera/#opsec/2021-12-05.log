[02:11:45] <Joanna> I’ve come up with what I think is a good starting point for health advice. I won’t even consider advice from someone who isn’t older than me and in better health than I am. If they are a stranger I can’t verify how good their health is. I don’t take advice from people who use drugs seriously either.
[02:27:52] <jan6> drugs include medicine ;P
[02:28:34] <Joanna> That’s what all druggies say :)
[02:28:43] <pyfisch> Joanna: how do you account for survivor bias? Many people older than you in good health might just have gotten lucky.
[02:28:45] <jan6> also if you do that logic, then you cannot accept most doctors
[02:28:46] <jan6> lol
[02:29:54] <Joanna> pyfisch: that’s true some people are lucky and some people are in bad health through no fault of their own unfortunately.
[02:30:55] <Joanna> jan6: if someone is 90 and still running marathons they are worthy of respect.
[02:31:39] <jan6> that merely means they bother to bother with it
[02:31:40] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, the point is to keep the vaccines produced by large companies (monopoly)
[02:31:44] <jan6> lol
[02:31:51] *** Joins: Roey (~Roey@user/Roey)
[02:31:56] <CalimeroTeknik> and ramp up prices to make $$$
[02:32:12] <jan6> the older you get, the less likely it is that you actually BOTHER to exercise
[02:32:51] <CalimeroTeknik> when there was an initiative by the WHO to opensource vaccine recipes, nothing happened thanks to Gates
[02:33:11] <CalimeroTeknik> he managed to convince Cambridge University to not open its recipe
[02:33:12] <pyfisch> Joanna isn't it interesting to observe sick people younger than you?
[02:33:17] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: to be honest I have no interest in using any drug so
[02:33:44] <CalimeroTeknik> I'd say that this should be based on medical judgement
[02:33:51] <pyfisch> I mean like learn from their mistakes?
[02:33:56] <CalimeroTeknik> if you were rational
[02:34:34] <Joanna> pyfisch: bad health is more than just being sick I include lack of physical fitness also.
[02:34:53] <CalimeroTeknik> (I don't know why you have no interest, but I don't either because I have nursed covid patients, and my family members as well; neither of us got anything, so this is likely genetic advantage)
[02:35:37] <CalimeroTeknik> others are not so lucky and the only way for them to not end up suffocating is to use vaccination as it stands
[02:35:55] <Joanna> pyfisch: I know someone younger than me who isn’t overweight who can’t keep up with me walking up hills and it makes me feel sad for them.
[02:35:56] <pyfisch> Joanna of course it does among other things
[02:37:32] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: the idea that drugs are magical and can solve problems is a belief.
[02:37:43] <Joanna> It’s like religious faith.
[02:38:31] <CalimeroTeknik> you could see that I advocate selective usage based on medical judgement
[02:38:46] <CalimeroTeknik> there are excesses on either side of this
[02:39:44] <Joanna> Selective usage leads to hypocrisy..everyone has a different idea of which drugs are good to take.
[02:41:16] <Joanna> I know someone younger than me who is very obese and takes high blood pressure medicine rather than losing weight.
[02:41:27] <CalimeroTeknik> hypocrisy? how so, and what does it have to do with the idea that correct medical judgement is the only good way forward?
[02:41:28] * pyfisch wonders if there is a way to determine if a drug has a specific effect
[02:42:03] <CalimeroTeknik> and by medical judgement I mean on a per-person basis
[02:42:44] <CalimeroTeknik> in that case, I suppose that high bood pressure medication deals with the consequence of obesity?
[02:43:00] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: who gets to decide what is “correct” often it isn’t the person that is at the receiving end.
[02:43:54] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: he shouldn’t be taking drugs he should lose weight is my point.
[02:44:48] *** Parts: critr (~critr@user/critr) (.)
[02:45:03] <CalimeroTeknik> I do agree, but I still agree with taking the drug temporarily (if necessary in order to survive) while proceeding with solving the root cause
[02:45:18] <Joanna> The person I know who is younger and weaker than I am should take my advice to eat liver...
[02:45:27] <CalimeroTeknik> walking with crutches all life long is no good, obviously
[02:45:51] <CalimeroTeknik> is liver going to suffice?
[02:46:47] <CalimeroTeknik> I have had weak and strong periods in my life, and the reason was largely that I didn't have the motivation to get into shape physiologically
[02:47:06] <CalimeroTeknik> and you don't go and tell people "be motivated!"
[02:47:11] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: by using the word survive aka deciding life or death you have elevated the status of drugs and the people who make them to gods.
[02:47:29] <CalimeroTeknik> I have elevated drugs to the status of crutches.
[02:48:02] <CalimeroTeknik> temporary, imperfect makeshift measures that may mean the difference between managing to get out of a tough pass
[02:48:08] <CalimeroTeknik> and possibly dying
[02:48:26] <Joanna> pyfisch: there are certainly a lot of undesirable side effects of drugs including dependency
[02:48:41] <CalimeroTeknik> that's on a case-by-case basis
[02:48:55] <CalimeroTeknik> there's no such thing as dependency to vaccination, for example
[02:49:35] <Joanna> Lack of crutches may cause inconvenience but not death. That is not a good analogy.
[02:50:47] <CalimeroTeknik> what if you had to get out of the way or else you'll be crushed by a truck, but you can't move your legs for now?
[02:51:02] <Joanna> People can do with their bodies as they see fit. I choose not to use drugs and consider people who do weak.
[02:51:03] <CalimeroTeknik> crutches may well mean the difference between life and death in this case
[02:51:17] <pyfisch> What about Insulin? Isn't it an effective treatment of type 1 diabetes without serious side effects?
[02:51:18] <CalimeroTeknik> and that precisely makes it a good analogy, because most of the time, drugs are used as a convenience
[02:51:39] <CalimeroTeknik> pyfisch, it's not a cure, and it causes dependency for sure
[02:51:46] <CalimeroTeknik> but yes
[02:51:58] <Joanna> pyfisch: I’m more interested in what is causing all the diabetes.
[02:52:19] <CalimeroTeknik> that's a valid point. there is a tribe who have no cancers and no diabetes in South America
[02:52:25] <CalimeroTeknik> let me find the documentary
[02:52:44] <CalimeroTeknik> (spoilers: particularly healthy lifestyle)
[02:53:02] <Joanna> Whenever there is a problem l like to focus on where it came from
[02:54:16] <pyfisch> CalimeroTeknik insulin the same thing the body produces naturally. if you want to say so every single human is dependent on it. medicine merely substitutes it after the pancreas has stopped production.
[02:54:47] <Joanna> Anyone who has used drugs or ingested or inhaled chemicals could have health problems caused by those.
[02:55:42] <Joanna> pyfisch: why after billions of years of evolution would a pancreas stop working do you think?
[02:57:13] <pyfisch> It's an auto immune disease. The body attacks it's own cells.
[02:57:23] <Joanna> You would think that people with childhood diabetes would have become extinct long ago through natural selection
[02:57:50] <pyfisch> After billions of years of evolution we are so complex there are still bugs in humans.
[02:58:12] <Joanna> pyfisch: that’s right .
[02:58:57] <Joanna> Autoimmune disease which is happening fairly recently.
[02:59:30] <pyfisch> Diabetes is known since at least since antiquity
[02:59:47] <pyfisch> (including childhood diabetes)
[03:00:17] <Joanna> Well I’m sure glad I don’t have it.
[03:01:39] <pyfisch> The current understanding of diabetes is that there are genetic factors but often a trigger is needed like the flu or another infection.
[03:02:03] <Joanna> There are some genetic problems like sickle cell anemia which are beneficial if you only have one copy of the gene but deadly if you have two
[03:02:58] <Joanna> pyfisch: is there anyone who has never been administered drugs who has diabetes?
[03:03:57] <pyfisch> If you want to blame our horrible infectious diseases on something, I suggest animal husbandry. Smallpox, Tuberculosis, AIDS, SARS were all transmitted from animals to men
[03:04:46] <Joanna> pyfisch: that maybe true but the benefit of animals is worth it.
[03:05:13] <pyfisch> Joanna yes, diabetes occurs in small children. Communities like the Amish only use some medicine still they have diabetes.
[03:05:38] <Joanna> I don’t know any amish and can’t verify
[03:05:39] <pyfisch> Btw how do you define drugs?
[03:06:57] <Joanna> Anything that alters body chemistry to do things it wouldn’t ordinarily do.
[03:07:33] <Joanna> I consider coffee an alcohol drugs also
[03:08:04] <pyfisch> Chocolate too I guess
[03:08:20] <Joanna> Alcohol occurs naturally in ripe fruit
[03:08:52] <Joanna> I don’t consider chocolate a drug it doesn’t do much besides taste good.
[03:11:28] <jan6> 01:36 <Joanna> Anything that alters body chemistry to do things it wouldn’t ordinarily do.
[03:11:38] <jan6> define "ordinarily"
[03:11:40] <pyfisch> Chocolate increases serotonin levels and impunity the mood
[03:11:59] <jan6> isn't adrenaline a drug by that definition?
[03:12:01] <pyfisch> *improves
[03:12:11] <Joanna> I’ve heard chocolate is poisonous to dogs.
[03:12:12] <jan6> table salt would also be a drug
[03:12:28] <jan6> drink too much water, and you can literally kill yourself
[03:12:59] <Joanna> I ate some chocolate yesterday and didn’t notice any mood change so for me it isn’t a drug.
[03:13:19] <jan6> chocolate is just sweet, nothing else
[03:13:22] <Joanna> jan6: we are made of saltwater
[03:13:26] <jan6> yes
[03:13:46] <jan6> but you wouldn't classify table salt as a "drug" nor would you classify water, right
[03:13:53] <Joanna> Nope
[03:14:03] <jan6> yet both of them can totally mess with body chemistry
[03:14:06] <Joanna> They are essential parts
[03:14:19] <CalimeroTeknik> here is the documentary on the Tarahumara tribe that gets no cancer or diabetes https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=_xeH0KAqiqI
[03:14:59] <pyfisch> jan6: you need to eat more dark chocolate with lots of cocoa :p
[03:15:15] <jan6> anything <60% cocoa is horrible trash anyway
[03:15:17] <jan6> lol
[03:15:44] <jan6> I like ~60-70% myself, 80% is acceptable too, above that gets too bitter
[03:16:03] <pyfisch> something we can agree on :D
[03:19:10] <Joanna> Some chocolate definitely tastes better than other chocolate
[03:20:13] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: you should read nutrition and physical degeneration by Weston price.
[03:20:49] <Joanna> As soon as these people are introduced to western food and medicine their good health will go away.
[03:22:12] <Joanna> It looks like they have already adopted western clothing.
[03:24:47] *** Quits: imandes0 (~imandes0@109.75.35.208) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:42:12] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, interestingly I have a diet close to the Tarahumara, with the addition of root vegetables
[03:44:42] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: I was watching it a bit and it started to seem like anti meat consumption similar to the great reset folks
[03:45:08] <jan6> well, it makes sense, tbh, lol
[03:45:10] <Joanna> It also seemed to be emphasizing medicines
[03:45:42] <jan6> humans, for millenia, rarely had meat, and practically never had sweets available, other than some berries
[03:45:57] <jan6> nowdays even meat producs have sweeteners, very often
[03:46:42] <Joanna> Any time scientist / do gooder types find some indigenous people it doesn’t end well for the indigenous people
[03:47:16] <jan6> well, scientists don't matter much for that
[03:48:11] <jan6> the invasive "do "good"" guys are the baddies, as have always been, be it through veiled means or not
[03:48:34] <Joanna> I bet the first thing they did was order them to stop running around naked and wear western clothing made in some sweatshop
[03:48:50] <jan6> "our god is better than your god, also he says you should give half your income to our church and all your lands to our king, and if you resist you're heathens and we'll burn you"
[03:49:08] <Joanna> Exactly
[03:49:12] <jan6> "we have so much higher quality of life, here, have some shirts, candies, here's a clock"
[03:51:18] <Joanna> In the Weston price book the health of indigenous people went down fast after they started trading with westerners and eating western foods. For some reason natives find low nutrient sweet foods irresistible.
[03:51:20] <Hydragyrum> ever watch "The Gods Must Be Crazy"?
[03:51:25] <Joanna> Yes
[03:52:54] <Joanna> Even if the indigenous people aren’t forced to eat western diet they do so out of self loathing and shame from being part of a defeated culture.
[03:53:12] <CalimeroTeknik> sigh
[03:53:44] <CalimeroTeknik> that sounds like a caricature, honestly
[03:54:19] <Joanna> They don’t want to be seen eating uncivilized foods or running around naked even if it’s healthier
[03:55:25] <CalimeroTeknik> that doesn't even apply to the ones I was talking about to begin with
[03:55:44] <Joanna> They want to emulate the victors
[03:55:55] <CalimeroTeknik> you really sound dogmatic
[03:56:02] <CalimeroTeknik> and very illusioned
[03:56:03] *** moose` is now known as moose
[03:56:37] <Joanna> Have you read Weston price book I told you about at all?
[03:57:04] <jan6> lol
[03:57:23] <jan6> part of it is definitely pushing the "advanced society" narrative upon them
[03:58:13] <CalimeroTeknik> every bit of what you say has been true in some situation at some point, but all mashed together and blindly applied to the Tarahumara without sufficient knowledge of their history and current status seemed excessive
[03:59:07] <Joanna> I don’t know about that tribe in particular but I do question the motives of people who made the video.
[03:59:57] <CalimeroTeknik> I believe they are in search of meaning in their life, and it could be dangerous for the tribe, but apparently the bit of attention is doing them more good than bad for now
[04:00:22] <CalimeroTeknik> one could anticipate that if it generates tourism there, things are going to go south fast
[04:00:45] <jan6> but sugar is put into foods specifically because it's addictive, but it's addictive because it's high energy AND available in very small doses naturally, so for entire human evolution, sweet stuff has been only beneficial
[04:00:50] <Joanna> Are there any interesting resources in their lands that need to be exploited by any chance ...
[04:02:20] <jan6> there's resources to exploit in ALL places, question is if it's worth the bother
[04:03:46] <jan6> even deserts have worthwhile stuff...and even sand or rocks can be useful
[04:04:06] <Joanna> jan6: it’s not the sugar itself that is bad it’s the removal of all the minerals and nutrients during processing. Sugar cane is just a large grass with a sweet juicy pith. It’s juice is a natural healthy food.
[04:04:13] <jan6> it's just "is it worth the trouble, can it get X more efficiently from somewhere else"
[04:04:29] <jan6> well, it's sugar too
[04:05:58] <jan6> naturally there's not too much sugar, but there's ALSO a lot of other healthy stuff, yes, but I mean, sugar is extracted, because sugar's the "nice" and addictive stuff, and because it's so potent, it's also a favourite of all kinds of other organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, etc
[04:06:15] <jan6> which also makes food spoil faster, so you start adding additives, like preservatives
[04:06:28] <jan6> and so you start rolling the ball
[04:06:51] <Joanna> Sugar is an important nutrient for energy. By sugar I am including all digestible carbohydrates
[04:07:46] <Joanna> Cellulose is also sugar but we can’t digest it.
[04:08:27] <jan6> yes, but nowdays people can very easily get TOO MUCH energy, which makes it easy to get fat, and concentrated sugary stuff, like carbonated sodas and sweets also give a LOT of food for the organisms living around your teeth, worsening your dental health, etc, too
[04:09:03] <jan6> obviously things aren't as simple as "sugar bad"
[04:09:13] <Joanna> People can be obese yet nutrient deficient at the same time.
[04:10:13] <Joanna> It’s hard to eat right without doing all your own cooking
[04:10:18] <Joanna> Unfortunately
[04:10:25] <jan6> because sugar is what matters, food-makers don't care much about other stuff, and since you prefer sweets, you end up with less of other nutrients, especially because most sweet stuff is either candies, or combined with wheat, which is also full of carbohydrates
[04:10:48] <jan6> you don't need to do ALL your own cooking
[04:11:36] <Joanna> Restaurants don’t serve brown rice or whole grain pasta or whole wheat bread
[04:12:01] <jan6> you just have to learn and be aware of the tricks people use at food-making industries
[04:12:53] <jan6> you can definitely exclusively eat cafe/cafeteria/restaurant/etc food and be healthy, but you can't rely on them being exactly what they appear as
[04:13:13] <jan6> https://www.eatthis.com/sugar-in-restaurant-food/
[04:13:36] <jan6> notice how many of those are actually salads
[04:14:32] <Joanna> Restaurants just serve the lowest quality food that they can get away with at the highest price possible
[04:15:07] <jan6> also https://www.businessinsider.com/sugar-in-fast-food-2016-1?op=1
[04:15:19] <jan6> yeah, of course
[04:15:26] <Joanna> I went to restaurant last night but their food was kind of disappointing.
[04:15:30] <jan6> gotta maximize the profits
[04:15:40] <jan6> it also definitely depends on the place, and location
[04:16:07] <jan6> some places sell you purely the "experience", with food 10x what it cost them
[04:16:26] <jan6> some others might well be much smaller and cheaper, and actually focus on making good food
[04:16:39] <Joanna> Fast foods have white bread and hydrogenated vegetable oils and artificial flavor enhancers and high fructose corn syrup
[04:16:56] <jan6> yeah, murica is f*ed because of white bread
[04:17:04] <jan6> and corn
[04:17:54] <Joanna> There was a time when I thought corn syrup was from squeezing juice out of very sweet corn and boiling it down like maple syrup..
[04:18:20] <jan6> https://www.youwealthrevolution.com/blog/stop-eating-white-bread/
[04:19:39] <jan6> it's kinda cheesy site, with ad for daily energy sessions and stuff
[04:19:47] <jan6> but it has 3 points, which make sense
[04:19:51] <Joanna> The Crux of the problem is people are stupid and do whatever the ads/propaganda on tv tell them to do when it comes to their lifestyle. 
[04:20:44] <Joanna> Bread and chips definitely make me hungry
[04:21:01] <jan6> you lose weight due to carbohydrates binding a lot of water, white bread lacks fiber, so it doesn't matter from digestive aspect, and processing carbohydrates fluxtuates blood sugar, invoking a phantom hunger
[04:21:02] <Joanna> Whole grain bread is good though
[04:21:40] <jan6> of course, less proccessed stuff is in most cases better
[04:22:32] <Joanna> I lost some weight this year eating one meal a day of fatty meat and whole grain or potatoes
[04:22:47] <Joanna> And lots of fruit.
[04:23:18] <Joanna> It’s not that complicated really
[04:23:44] <jan6> yeah, it's well known that despite the industry's propaganda, fat isn't really bad, not nearly as much as pure sugar is
[04:23:56] <jan6> as long as you don't eat pure fat, of course
[04:24:17] <jan6> and yeah, if you bother to chart out healthy food like that
[04:24:21] <jan6> but it's not really taught
[04:24:32] <Joanna> I only eat animal fat I stopped using olive oil not that olive oil is bad.
[04:24:54] <jan6> most people don't really care enough to bother figuring out what's especially healthy or unhealthy
[04:25:05] <jan6> nor bother making stuff themselves
[04:25:27] <Joanna> They want to keep people unhealthy and confused and then sell them the miracle drugs to cure them.
[04:26:00] *** Joins: treble (~treble@user/treble)
[04:26:05] <Joanna> There is so much disinformation out there
[04:26:08] <jan6> speaking of miracle, have you heard about miracle fruit?
[04:26:16] <Joanna> Nope
[04:26:34] <jan6> there's tablets of it too, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synsepalum_dulcificum
[04:26:40] <jan6> Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant in the Sapotaceae family known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit,[2] miracle berry, miraculous berry,[2] sweet berry,[3][4][5] and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun,[6]
[04:26:40] <jan6> taami, asaa, and ledidi. 
[04:27:00] <jan6> The berry itself has a low sugar content[7] and a mildly sweet tang. It contains a glycoprotein molecule, with some trailing carbohydrate chains, called miraculin.[8] When the fleshy part of the fruit is eaten, this molecule binds to the tongue's taste buds, causing sour foods to taste sweet. At neutral pH, miraculin binds and blocks the receptors, but at low pH (resulting from ingestion of sour
[04:27:00] <jan6> foods) miraculin binds proteins and becomes able to activate the sweet receptors, resulting in the perception of sweet taste.[9] This effect lasts until the protein is washed away by saliva (up to about 30 minutes).[10]
[04:31:18] <Joanna> That’s interesting but I don’t like the idea of my sense of taste being tricked. Isn’t that called stevia?
[04:35:05] <Joanna> The interesting thing is the artificial sweeteners consumed by obese people can make them hungry which doesn’t help
[04:36:16] <Joanna> Has anyone seen the movie fat sick and nearly dead about the guy from Australia who cured his health by switching to a juice diet ?
[04:37:36] <jan6> no
[04:38:13] <jan6> unrelated, but sounds a bit like the Jilly Juice craze, lol
[04:38:36] <jan6> totally healthy can cures cancer and autism, while at it!

[04:45:37] <Joanna> I’d much rather just eat the fruit and vegetables but maybe juicing gets more nutrients out of it.
[04:45:50] <jan6> depends on what you juice, I bet
[04:45:59] <Joanna> Of course
[04:46:36] <jan6> also can definitely make it nicer to eat some stuff, like you probably wouldn't eat raw onion normally, but mixing onion juice with something else, you might be willing to drink the equivalent of a whole onion
[04:47:15] <jan6> in general, mixing stuff is cool, not limited to food
[04:47:16] <Joanna> I once had a juicer that wasted a lot of the apples I was trying to juice because it used a grater and centrifugal force you juice
[04:48:02] <Joanna> You can eat onion with your other foods though
[04:48:24] <jan6> I've seen apple juicing which went basically "slice 'em up thin, lay 'em down, press the juice out with a huge press", which had the cool byproduct that you could still eat the pressed apples just fine, they were just a little dry-ish
[04:48:54] <Joanna> A press is definitely better
[04:49:28] <jan6> the apples were crushed and oxydized so they were brown not white, but still quite alright
[04:58:03] <Joanna> That’s stuff I would feed to animals
[05:00:17] <jan6> unrelated to previous conversation, but suppose I wanna start having a pgp key. would it be better to publicize a "master key" and use different keys, signed by the master key? or should I simply use the publicized key as the main key, with any other keys being mostly personal use? and should I keep the "master" key as rsa4096-only, or should I include ed25519 and p-512 keys too (cause curve keys
[05:00:18] <jan6> are great, but only in draft status for pgp, and MAY not be supported)?
