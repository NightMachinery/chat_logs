[00:35:53] <algorev> "Autovivifying object closures not yet implemented. Sorry."
[00:35:59] <algorev> It's a compile-time error

[00:48:03] <lizmat> could you create a gist with the --ll-exception backtrace ?
[00:53:38] <algorev> https://gist.github.com/algorev/aa28de561b06e4d975b4a7b30e1be1b1
[00:53:56] <algorev> I added the affected code too
[00:56:10] <MasterDuke> i suspect you need a space after your role/class names, before the '{'
[00:57:25] <algorev> Oh
[00:57:29] <algorev> It worked!
[00:57:33] <algorev> Thanks a lot!
[00:57:48] <algorev> I do have a last question though
[00:57:56] <lizmat> yeah, also for the methods for consistency  :-)
[00:58:15] <algorev> How do you `require` code from a file that's in the same directory
[00:58:22] <algorev> Raku's module system confuses me
[00:58:40] <algorev> lizmat very good point ahah
[01:00:27] <lizmat> algorev: I guess the question should first be: why do you need 'require' ?
[01:01:22] <algorev> The file i sent in the gist contains a few class and role definitions and i'd like to use the from another file
[01:01:32] <algorev> *them
[01:02:36] <lizmat> perhaps https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Exporting_and_selective_importing could be of help ?
[01:03:01] <algorev> Sounds like it
[01:03:23] <algorev> Though in my case raku seems to think that the current directory is not part of the module search path
[01:03:35] <algorev> Is there an option to tell it where to look?
[01:03:44] <algorev> I'm making a gist showing what it tells me
[01:03:48] <lizmat> -I
[01:03:50] <lizmat> if you must
[01:04:03] <lizmat> aka, -I.
[01:04:36] <lizmat> there are a bunch of reasons for not wanting to use that in production, but for prototyping it's ok
[01:07:53] <algorev> https://gist.github.com/algorev/be7728c27d822ec45f631c42fa7d11dc
[01:08:07] <algorev> I'd prefer knowing the correct way if i can make it work
[01:08:16] <algorev> Less hassle for everyone down the road
[01:14:58] <lizmat> I would use "use ActivationFunction" and call the script with -I.
[01:15:36] <lizmat> and probably drop the "use v6"  , that's really redundant in a script with a .raku extension
[01:18:23] <algorev> It worked! Thanks a lot. Also, noted for the v6 ;)

[20:15:46] <Voldenet> >what is wrong about moarvm >it uses reference counting
[20:15:55] <Voldenet> I know what this means, but I know how this could be interpreted

[20:25:14] <tib> (sorry Voldenet I shortened the question without noticing this, I edit it right now)
[20:27:37] <Voldenet> m: sub foo {return Hash.new}; my %hash = foo();

[20:29:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar cf1ee490c: ( no output )
[20:29:33] <Skarsnik> The issue if you have this in code, it fail on the assignment. Took me a while to figure that it was because foo was return Hash

[20:41:34] <timo> you could makethe case that tracing GC is kind of sort of a little bit valid as "reference counting", since you count references to things, but also you only have 0 or 1 as counts, and you count all references there are, and not continuously, but every now and then ...

[20:42:04] <moon-child> yes, 'unified theory of gc' or some such
[20:42:12] <timo> byte string theory
[20:42:14] <moon-child> argues gc vs rc is a continuum; esp. barriers
[20:42:45] <timo> i think "deferred reference counting" is already a thing that exists? but apart from that name i don't know anything
[20:43:56] <moon-child> Yeah.  Don't do all the work up-front; push the object whose rc is to be decremented on a queue and then do some work on the queue when you have to.  Goal is to avoid pauses
[20:44:10] <moon-child> also rc systems with periodic tracing for cycle elimination cf python

[20:56:32] <timo> tracing gc is kind of like adding every object ever into a big random-accessed queue, then later deciding which objects aren't actually supposed to be in the to-be-freed queue
