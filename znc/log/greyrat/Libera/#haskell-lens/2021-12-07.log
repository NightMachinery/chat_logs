[12:57:35] <dminuoso> c_wraith: Is the code visible somewhere on github/lab/etc though?
[12:57:44] <dminuoso> Curious what that library would look like
[16:40:59] <xplat> generally i find most witherlike things work best if you use nonempty types and return in Maybe also

[19:26:38] <c_wraith> dminuoso: no.  I wanted to document it, to show what the code looks like analogously to the blog post that originally inspired it.  But I stopped doing that and did... nothing.
[20:45:02] <c_wraith> dminuoso: https://github.com/chowells79/lens-witherable  It's short on the documentation I wanted to add to show why I think it's better than the linked blog post. But the API docs are there.
