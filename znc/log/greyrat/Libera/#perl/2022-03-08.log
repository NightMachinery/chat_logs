[01:22:51] <Nelgin> I'm trying to check if some json is valid, and we're provided two different formats, sometimes data is in $json->{day}->{Mon} and sometimes in $json->{day}-{Mon][0] but if I check the latter it complains about using a string as an array ref. Without removing strict refs, how should I properly check for an array?

[01:30:14] <Adura> When does one decide to stop using ->, I usually stop at the first.
[01:30:40] <LeoNerd> After the first they're entirely optional; some people write them all, most people don't

[01:40:19] <kjetilho> why no -> in front of the array subscript?  I use "->" religiously to dereference.  perhaps C damage, where "->" vs. "." is ... quite important.

[01:44:20] <simcop2387> didn't see the original question, but you don't use -> when it's not a reference.  so @x=(1..10); $x[5], but you can leave it off also for doing deeper lookups into a structure for brevity, i.e. $x[1][2][3]
[01:44:32] <simcop2387> that would be the same as $x[1]->[2]->[3]

[20:57:10] <kongsheng> Can Perl5 perform symbolic computation without extending the language?
[20:58:43] <kongsheng> I want to manipulate symbolic expressions according to a ruleset but evaluate the expressions with particular values as an option.
[21:01:34] <LeoNerd> Perl values can have operator overloading, so yes you could pass such values around and have them retain their identity as symbols

[21:02:12] <kongsheng> That's cool.
[21:02:28] <kongsheng> I need operator overloading, but I need to maintain the identity of two symbols.
[21:05:18] <kongsheng> What I have is two symbols {x,y}. I have a function that takes two symbols from that set at a time and produces a single symbol. This function is defined by a table {x,x} -> y, {y,y} -> x etc. I need to maintain the identities of x and y, do some operator overloading on functions derived from the table, and then instantiate objects with particular
[21:05:19] <kongsheng> values of those symbols such as {true, false} , {0,1}, {heads, tails} etc.

[21:14:30] <kongsheng> Ok let me go a step further. Given {x,y} and the table, I have a derived function from the table. In some sense it is an inverting function, and I want to overload the tilde ~ with that function. Instead of writing Inv(x) or Inv(y), I want to type ~x , it will be evaluated as y. I want to type ~y, it will be evaluated as x. I have a third function
[21:14:31] <kongsheng> derived from the first two, the function is defined with it's own table and the * operator is overloaded. So I can build expressions ~x * y, y*x, ~y*~x, etc. They get evaluated as x or y accordingly. There are differently inheritances based on this core structure {x,y}, table. One of them replaces {x,y} with {0,1}. I build symbolic expressions,
[21:14:31] <kongsheng> evaluate them to x or y accordingly, but the ouput is the correct 0 or 1. Another instantiated class follows the same reasoning but replaces {x,y} with {true, false} or {heads, tails} and they may need additional functionality.
