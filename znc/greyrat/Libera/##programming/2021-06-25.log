[00:01:18] <old_mcdonald> That article is complete fucking fud gem
[00:01:20] <old_mcdonald> That article is complete fucking fud GeDaMo 
[00:01:23] <old_mcdonald> I have seen it before too
[00:01:31] <old_mcdonald> davve, as I said const works differently
[00:01:38] <Guest9> nested function is one way for data encapsulation, which are other?
[00:01:40] <old_mcdonald> Typing is stricter
[00:01:45] <old_mcdonald> (void* needs casts)
[00:01:54] <old_mcdonald> Variable length arrays are only in C99 not in C++ etc

[00:03:05] <old_mcdonald> GeDaMo, it claims "sequential execution" and "flat memory model" are C features
[00:03:09] <old_mcdonald> Complete fucking bullshit
[00:03:16] <old_mcdonald> These are the model of basically any sane modern language
[00:03:23] <old_mcdonald> including Java, Python, whatever else
[00:03:47] <GeDaMo> And the point it's making is that most modern CPUs don't work like that
[00:03:51] <old_mcdonald> And ilp has zilch to do with C either, neither has any other means to increase hardware performance
[00:03:59] <old_mcdonald> GeDaMo, of course
[00:04:00] <neshpion> does C support variables?
[00:04:06] <old_mcdonald> And the point also is that in principle it should be transparent
[00:04:16] <old_mcdonald> That these cpu features are causing such problems is a bug
[00:04:31] <old_mcdonald> It should be completely transparent and same result as sequential execution
[00:04:45] <Guest9> i am still not sure what is the reason of defining a term like "data encapsulation". Isnt it natural? when a function inside function or properties/methods within class are local.
[00:05:01] *** Quits: ZenixOwler (~networker@118.69.128.37) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:05:17] <Guest9> i mean is terminology like local/global is not enough?
[00:05:52] <old_mcdonald> Yes, local variables remaining local to a function is one simple instance of data encapsulation too
[00:06:16] <Guest9> same beer in another glass
[00:06:51] <old_mcdonald> No
[00:07:09] <old_mcdonald> Essentially
[00:07:14] <old_mcdonald> Functions skew close to "pure action"
[00:07:20] <old_mcdonald> And data is well pure data
[00:07:27] <old_mcdonald> OOP is about combining the two into a signle unit
[00:07:41] <[o> eehhh
[00:07:43] <[o> no
[00:07:44] <[o> :D
[00:07:50] <whatsupboy> Guest9: you are getting it wrong, data encapsulation means not letting the user know the details of your implementation. Example if you write a function for square root. Then you hide its details from user and user dont really care how it is implemented but just uses your function to find squareroot. It is very similar to abstraction Function inside function doesn't matter it could be a class
[00:07:53] <whatsupboy> also
[00:08:01] <old_mcdonald> [o obviously in practice functions can and do indeed do a lot of state manipulation too
[00:08:18] <[o> function is an overloaded term. they even may represent PROCEDURES

[00:09:00] <old_mcdonald> GeDaMo, the more important point is that the CPU does not expose these workings at all to any language or anything executing on it

[00:12:55] <blahboybaz> What am I seeing? I'm seeing it all over the place. It resembles an arrow function but idk if that's what it is. They aren't using round parnthesis and I thought you had to have that with an arrow function. Example: The  "x => 42 + x"  in  "const mockCallback = jest.fn(x => 42 + x);"  is that an arrow function being passed in? If so then what is going on with "x" where x is writting without

[05:55:11] <blahboybaz> How does a js interperter handle promisses? For example, I write a bunch of synchronous code then a promise at the end of the file (last lines in the file) - does then interprter look for promises before it executes anything else, fire up the promise, then go back to the top of the file and start executing the rest of the (synchronous) code?

[12:12:31] <flareon> beaky: Nearly all development effort is the effort to manage the ever-growing complexity of the program. But only some of that complexity is inevitable. Most of the complexity is accidental and is produced by bad design. You can have good sketching tools to understand the inheritance relationships in your code. You might even try to code in a two dimensional space instead of a linear text-editor. 
[12:12:37] <flareon> But that kind of thinking implicitly assumes that the design which requires such tools is the correct design.

[14:34:18] <flareon> mrig: Sufism. Kabbalah. Vedanta... There are many ways to express the idea of monism in flowery languages. Most don't create a new proposition. The practices they suggest would be too inconvenient for you. It's pretty useless unless all you want to do is quote classical poetry to seem like an erudite.

[21:48:32] <luiserebii> is it possible to fail to solve a challenge in a technical interview and still proceed to the next step of the application process?
[21:49:11] <lf94> yes
[21:49:26] <lf94> you could have shown good reasoning skills.
[21:49:48] <lf94> someone else could have solved the problem simply because they solved it before, and not display any reasoning.
[21:50:39] <lf94> I'm a good example of this: I failed a take home test because I did it in JavaScript and not TypeScript.
[21:50:48] <mrig> Is there perhaps a mathematical operation that that is particularly good for measuring the accuracy of pi, within a digital computing environment?
[21:50:50] <lf94> So while I solved the challenged, I failed overall.
[21:51:26] <lf94> I was annoyed though because they didn't say it had to be in TypeScript, but I learned by myself that since it was mentioned in the job description, I should've done it in TS.
[21:51:26] <mrig> some calculator trick that would give away the number of digits of precision perhaps?

[21:52:27] <rindolf> luiserebii: yes, it is
[21:52:33] <luiserebii> i wish i had showed my reasoning skills better... because i was worried about the time limit, and realized it was the first part of a question, i wanted to get something on code sooner than later, and proceeded to debug it throughout the interview. however... if i had focused a little more on returning to the thinking process, i feel i could have shown it better. my code was not working because 
[21:52:39] <luiserebii> the algorithm in my mind wasn't clear... so logically, i got stuck in bugs...
[21:53:15] <luiserebii> it's been a day since the interview, and i've been waiting to see what might happen. i get the sense that they must be deliberating on either cutting me off here or taking me to the next step of the application test... which is a 10-15 hour compensated project
[21:53:16] <pikapika> I think its ridiculous people are expected to solve algowank questions in the limited time of an interview
[21:53:23] <mrig> pikapika: how so?

[21:54:23] <mrig> well, one would not like the stack to fall over into a heap, for sure. But I somehow doubt that this is what you are referring too.

[21:55:44] <pulse> pikapika, try implies you're not sure of yourself
[21:55:52] <pulse> which makes you look like you don't know what you're doing
[21:56:02] <pulse> it's better to let the clients think you know exactly what you're doing

[23:16:11] <pulse> CalimeroTeknik, eh, like i said. code how you want to. i already know what works for me and what doesnt'
[23:16:22] <W> in highly polymorphic languages, inlining functions might not be possible most of the time
[23:16:24] <pulse> and function overhead is rarely a good thing in perf intensive code
[23:16:33] <pulse> sometimes the compiler can compensate. more often than not it can't

[23:17:45] <pulse> quartz, probably? :p
[23:17:51] <CalimeroTeknik> pulse, a for loop is excellent code for implementing a program that *performs* actions (i.e. with side effects)
[23:17:53] <pulse> how are you gonna write code without an editor
[23:18:02] <CalimeroTeknik> to each program type its best coding
[23:18:03] <W> with highly nested functions, function inlining might also lead to excessively large binaries
[23:18:06] <pulse> CalimeroTeknik, yes, i like side effects

[23:18:25] <pulse> ah. xor
[23:18:25] <W> it's a trade-off the compiler has to make
[23:18:29] <CalimeroTeknik> but questions were asked; posting code, notably
[23:18:30] <pulse> i'd say go with the IDE
[23:18:32] <quartz> pulse: lol yeah sorry dumb question. What do you recommend I use? IDE or text editor for writing C? 
[23:18:37] <pulse> IDE
[23:18:42] <quartz> For example, in Java, I use IntelliJ. It's nice.
[23:18:45] <quartz> OK
[23:18:46] <pulse> unless you're already familiar with vim, gdb and the likes
[23:18:55] <quartz> vim is hard to learn :( 
[23:18:57] <soreau> pulse: you can just `echo -e "<code>" > source.c` ;)
[23:18:59] <neshpion> quartz: it really depends on what feature set you expect to have in your workflow, if any.  If you aren't using code generation and refactoring tools, I don't think you need to jump into learning how to use an IDE in *addition* to programming C in a linux environment
[23:19:09] <pulse> quartz, not really. 20 minutes on vimtutor should be enough to get you started
[23:19:15] <Twipply> So, why is a variable called i bad programming?
[23:19:16] <pulse> and it's a really powerful editor
[23:19:38] <quartz> So use VIM in one terminal window, and compile the code in another terminal window?
[23:19:42] <W> coding Java in an IDE is something entirely different than coding C in an IDE; the idioms of Java almost all benefit from IDE features, C much less so (though obviously autocompletion and popup documentation is as useful there as anywhere)
[23:19:43] <Chewt_> I've been using vim for a few years now and can definitely recommend taking the time to learn to use it
[23:19:46] <mason0> it takes far more than 20 minutes to be productive in vim
[23:20:12] <Chewt_> quartz: yup. This kind of workflow works especially well with a multiplexer like tmux
[23:20:13] <quartz> W: Good point.
[23:20:13] <mason0> probably weeks just to get used to the idea of modality
[23:20:20] <neshpion> quartz: and personally, i learned a lot by dropping MS Visual Studio and compiling a C++ project with make and gcc.  Things that the 'build my shit pls senpai' button abstracted me away from, so i didn't understand them for a long time

[23:20:26] <CalimeroTeknik> neshpion, "avoiding variables will produce far less practical results than the variable-laden programming", you said, but take some time to analyze how easy each program is to check for correctness http://ix.io/3r7m

[23:21:35] <pulse> it's a joy using a visual debugger

[23:23:35] <CalimeroTeknik> pulse, interestingly, when you start doing more declarative programming, your debugger is your compiler, with the type errors, and you don't use a debugger, any more :)

[23:51:28] <Chewt_> iteration counter would be more specific if thats what you are looking for
[23:51:36] <oldlaptop> It's an exception that proves the rule: the reason single-char variable names are *generally* bad is that there is not generally such a universal convention for their meanings.
[23:51:43] <CalimeroTeknik> DPA, troll; but the interesting response to give you here is that the type should not appear in the name; only the meaning you decide to consider that the value of the variable has, should be included in its name
[23:51:52] <oldlaptop> (x, y, and z as Cartesian coordinates are another rule-proving exception)
[23:52:07] <DPA> i it is, then
[23:52:27] <Twipply> i for integer, hurray
[23:52:39] <CalimeroTeknik> integer for integer, if you mean integer
[23:52:48] <DPA> i for the outer most loop counter.

[23:53:04] <jeaye> I don't use j combined with i, since they look too similar. I do use i and k though.
[23:53:20] <Twipply> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, if you mean The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
[23:53:24] <Twipply> or maybe just NASA is fine
[23:53:27] <jeaye> I'd rather use i, k, m than i, j, k, to prevent hard to spot typos.

[23:54:33] <DPA> I use n,m,l as end count for the i,j,k counters.
[23:54:58] <CalimeroTeknik> oldlaptop, yes, x, y and z have fixed definitions in the field (for the meaning to give to the value they contain), where this isn't so much the case for i (repeat: it does not help give meaning to the value it contains)
[23:55:09] <oldlaptop> That is not factually correct.
[23:55:18] <Twipply> i sure seems to have a fixed definition in our field
[23:55:30] <CalimeroTeknik> x, y and z will be values along three space dimensions

[23:55:47] <neshpion> i for integer/iterator/index has much more of a connection to the meaning of its use-case than x,y,z which are completely arbitrary names for spatial axes
[23:55:59] <CalimeroTeknik> i will be… at best an index, but that's not sufficient for me, whereas values along space dimensions are

[23:56:28] <neshpion> i is the initial for its three most common meanings; how does x, y, or z relate lexographically to anything spatial or graphical?
[23:56:38] <DPA> x,y,z,w,u,v, unless texture coordinates, then u,v,w
