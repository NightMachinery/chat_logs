[05:14:40] <kurahaupo> MetaNova: for me, 'whitespace' is only used as a fluid quantity measured in millimetres or pixels or ems, as a contraction of 'white space'. "A space" is only countable when talking of a sequence of bytes or codepoints; "some space" or "some whitespace" is uncountable when quantifying the separation between glyphs, or the visual sparseness or density.
[05:15:05] <MetaNova> I see
[05:19:40] <kurahaupo> I don't object to "some whitespaces" on grammatical logic, but I do think it's a needlessly verbose, even pretentious version of "some spaces" (since it's almost always used to mean that, and excluding tabs, newlines, etc)

[06:49:36] <CuriosTiger> In this case, combined with "jeez" (which is a euphemism for "Jesus",) it usually expresses disappointment or even disgust.

[08:15:45] <furrykef> So "Don't bite the hand that feeds you" is *pretty* close here... but not quite fitting since the police don't really want to be helpful in the first place. Rather, the suspect is making a bad situation worse.
[08:17:55] <furrykef> I guess I'll go with "bite the tiger's tail"

[13:25:57] <swarfega> i just wouldnt use kneeled
[13:27:12] <swarfega>  Right now, both forms exist. They are both still acceptable. In American and British English, knelt is still the most common of the two. British English speakers don't use kneeled as much as Americans do, but it is also gaining in popularity in that version of English.
