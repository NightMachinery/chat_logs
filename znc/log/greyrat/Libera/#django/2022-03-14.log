[02:25:45] <ivii> I have model Meter and Reading I have to find readings from meter serial number
[02:26:47] <ivii> in ReadingSerializer I tried adding filterset_fields = ['^meter__serial_number']

[02:28:13] <dang`r`us> that's not a field
[02:28:32] <dang`r`us> does DRF support transitive access like that?
[02:28:36] <dang`r`us> haven't used it in a while
[02:28:54] <dang`r`us> ah sorry, filterset_fields, that's something I haven't used ever
[02:29:06] <dang`r`us> not sure about the caret though
[02:30:23] <ivii> I have no idea, first time using django. I found it can be done using django-filters
[02:31:53] *** Joins: dodobrain (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain)
[02:32:00] <ivii> django rest framework has the worst documentation I've ever seen https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/
[02:32:42] <dang`r`us> it's not very beginner friendly, true
[02:33:10] <dang`r`us> anyway, if you're working with DRF serializers that's probably not compatible with django-filter
[02:33:20] <dang`r`us> I'd expect that to require querysets, not DRF serializers
[02:33:59] <dang`r`us> ah, ok, DRF has django-filter support
[02:34:05] <dang`r`us> never mind then
[02:34:21] <farn> have you tried it without the caret?
[02:34:41] <dang`r`us> however I think my initial hunch was right, from that page:
[02:34:47] <dang`r`us> "If all you need is simple equality-based filtering, you can set a filterset_fields attribute on the view, or viewset, listing the set of fields you wish to filter against."
[02:35:11] <dang`r`us> "simple equality-based" sounds like ... just fields, and those being compared with =
[02:35:27] <dang`r`us> but yeah, maybe try it without the carrot. Can't hurt, it's surely misplaced here
[02:36:29] <dodobrain> if carrot doesnt work, try the stick ?

[03:13:37] <zamba> i find that i constantly repeat some of the fields in my models.. so i'm wondering if i maybe should try and consolidate this in a way..
[03:13:39] <zamba> https://bpa.st/76XA
[03:13:54] <zamba> (that's just from two of the models, i'm doing this in at least 3-4 other)
[03:21:13] <jim> well if you write the same fields in lots of different models, my first question, what's the general purpose of these fields, the ones that get repeated?
[03:22:08] <jim> (I'm probably gonna wander to the store pretty soon)
[03:22:44] <zamba> i'm creating a web app to keep account with ballots for bingo
[03:22:59] <zamba> and we have different outlets selling these ballots on behalf of our radio station
[03:24:04] <zamba> so each ballot can be of one of two "types" - main or pause (don't ask, it's bingo terminology, and i'm not really familiar with it either).. and each ballot also has an "unique" id.. it's more like a running id.. so it's a fixed number of ballots and the id repeats itself..
[03:24:10] <jim> would the bingo ballots generally go into one model in your app?
[03:24:27] <zamba> jim: what do you mean? as an unique model?
[03:24:32] <zamba> unique/separate
[03:24:46] <zamba> i didn't think that, at least
[03:24:48] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[03:24:52] <jim> or a model you already have
[03:24:59] <zamba> as there's no individual tracking of each ballot
[03:25:11] <zamba> they are more treated as a bunch
[03:25:34] <jim> so you have a bunch of ballots...
[03:25:36] <zamba> you generally don't order just one.. and the same with delivered to the different outlets.. they usually get 500 or 1000 every time
[03:26:01] <jim> how many ballots (for example) can each user have?
[03:26:25] <zamba> and the same with the sale report.. the different outlets should report weekly on the number of ballots sold.. and they will then just report that they've sold 50 main and 25 pause ballots.. and then the start and end running id of each type
[03:26:28] *** Quits: ivii (~ivan@user/ivii) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:26:36] <zamba> well, no limit to that
[03:26:57] <zamba> but in practical terms.. we don't want an outlet sitting on several thousand ballots
[03:27:13] <jim> ok, what are these ballots for?
[03:28:07] <zamba> bingo ballots: https://cdn01.vulcanpost.com/wp-uploads/2019/04/bingo-fi.jpg
[03:28:10] <zamba> maybe it's the wrong word for it
[03:28:26] <zamba> these are sold to the bingo players from the outlets
[03:28:46] <zamba> and then they play with these ballots live from a radio broadcast
[03:29:02] <jim> so the ballot is the game card?
[03:30:00] <zamba> yeah
[03:30:10] <zamba> that's maybe a better word for it
[03:30:18] <zamba> (i'm not an english native speaker)
[03:30:27] <zamba> maybe i should rename it to game card instead of ballot
[03:30:54] <jim> do other people call them ballots?
[03:31:05] <zamba> no idea.. i just like to name my models in english :)
[03:31:12] <zamba> we call them "bingoblokk" in norwegian :)
[03:31:51] <jim> ok, so part of this, is you're looking for a name for them
[03:32:49] <zamba> well, not really :)
[03:33:34] <jim> it does sound like they might need their own model
[03:33:36] <zamba> i'm looking for a way to not have to constantly update the field definition inside several different models if i decide to change a bit on how i want to treat them
[03:33:53] <zamba> yeah, but i'm not sure how that should be handled.. as i'm not tracking them individually
[03:35:40] <jim> right, you need to go back to design, to decide how game cards fit into the rest of your models
[03:37:18] <zamba> that's why i'm asking here :)
[03:38:05] <jim> what entity can use a game card to play bingo?
[03:38:40] <zamba> people.. humans .)
[03:38:54] <zamba> they are not tracked here.. apart from the winners
[03:39:10] <jim> ok, do you have a model that's 1 to 1 with humans?
[03:39:15] <zamba> for that single game cards are identified
[03:39:39] <zamba> since we need to document the winning number and also the game card that was used
[03:40:30] <jim> what exactly does the computer know about game cards?
[03:40:35] <zamba> but i didn't think of a model for that.. instead just the following: https://bpa.st/NGMQ
[03:40:57] <zamba> i don't think i understand your last question
[03:41:32] <jim> is a game card a physical piece of cardboard with printing on it?
[03:41:47] <zamba> it's a paper with printing on it, yes
[03:42:58] <jim> ok, so maybe the computer (I guess meaning the app, the database) knows things about the cards
[03:43:32] <zamba> i'm not following
[03:44:23] <jim> at max, the computer would know: if the card has been sold, if it's been played, and the entire content of the card, all 25 (24?) numbers
[03:44:52] <jim> and if it has been sold, who bought it
[03:44:58] <zamba> no, not that detailed

[03:46:44] <jim> zamba, that probably changes what the app can do
[03:46:46] <zamba> but it should know that all game cards within a number series have been shipped to an outlet and that a subset of these game cards have been sold the last week (up to the max number of available game cards at the outlet at any given time) and also which of these game cards, if any, had a winning number for the last week
[03:47:07] <zamba> there are 10+ different outlets
[03:47:48] <jim> I need to pause here, I'll be back in a bit
[03:48:15] <zamba> the computer/app does not know who bought which game cards.. and it doesn't know every individual number of the different game cards (though that may be something we want to do in the future)
[03:49:24] <jim> and I'm still thinking, that cards will need their own data model (then you'd have a row in your db per card, maybe that's too much too)

[10:41:55] <jim> ok, so my journey on forms, has taken me to form "binding", which, if I understand correctly, is the creation of a new form object with fields, and values for those fields, likely from the POST attribute of the request object... so, a form can be constructed with the form data, and I would imagine it gets the form field errors at that time
[10:44:20] <jim> so then when you render that form, you should get form field error messages, rendered close to the fields they refer to, with the idea being, the user should be able to read those errors and correct the mistakes they've made

[12:42:09] <jim> gordonjcp, I made a subclass of django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm, that adds an email address to the form, and sets the order of the total resulting fields to something reasonable. I somewhat altered the view function that leads to it, by exposing a couple of variables

[12:58:21] <jim> dodo, to answer your question directly, it's because my act of subclassing UserCreationForm, has the effect of not showing the form field error messages, and/or that subclassing has the effect of preventing the submit function from performing its purpose, which is to contact the server with a post of the form
[12:59:09] <jim> gordonjcp, there are a few of you listening, someone probably did (or would have) asked
[12:59:45] <gordonjcp> jim: what is it doing, and how does this differ from what you expect?
[13:00:04] <jim> one thing I didn't do, is redownload django and test using a new install of it
[13:00:13] <dodo> jim: first guess is you're using crispy forms incorrectly

[13:02:04] <jim> gordonjcp, I thought I answered that: I purposely put invalid stuff in the forms... what I expected, was error messages saying what I did wrong... what I got instead, was NO MESSAGES of any kind.
[13:02:22] <dodo> crispy
[13:02:43] <jim> ok
[13:04:36] <jim> what did I do wrong with crispy? the thing is, I think I ruled crispy out, when I switched back to the non-subclass (i.e., UserCreationForm), and I then -got- the messages I was expecting. I wwould think that's a very good ruling out of crispy forms as the problem
[13:05:19] <dodo> jim: i mean, you come here and tell us that django is buggy.. but it turns out you don't render your form with django..
[13:05:21] <jim> if not, please tell me how I made a mistake
[13:05:53] <dodo> ok..
[13:06:08] <dodo> did you actually share your form code?
[13:06:15] <jim> so, I would replace {{ form|drispy }} with {{ form }}?
[13:06:46] <jim> of course, and, if I didn't show enough of it, I'll commit it all and show the link
[13:07:11] <gordonjcp> jim: do you display the messages in your template?

[13:33:26] <jim> (the frustration is not about any people, it's all about the code... I think one of the biggest examples, is the times when I lean hard on the submit button (well, really, hit it several times), and (1) not get any response from the server, and (2) not get any response from the code telling me why it won't submit the form
[13:34:07] <jim> (when the subclass is in use in testreg)

[13:35:39] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[13:41:53] <jim> let me give you a small howto on using my test, it's one thing... in the testreg function in users/views.py, there is a variable call_isvalid which you manually go into the function, and set it true or false, depending on whether you want the view to call form.is_valid(). Try setting it to False, so it will not call form.is_valid() ever, at all... and try putting valid responses in all the fields, so you get a valid form (won't tell you though, the False
[13:41:53] <jim> at the top of the view function tells to never call is_valid on the form)... then try values that are not valid for the form, and see what you get
[13:42:03] <jim> the other thing,
[13:43:25] <jim> is you can select UserCreationForm for the two places in the testreg view function, OR you can choose UserRegisterForm, the subclass, to place in the testreg view function.
[13:44:05] <jim> this selection should tell you, the nonsubclass works fine, and the subclass does not.

[16:16:26] <FunkyBob> toolbox_: the normal way in the web to submit data to the server is with a form... django is no different.
[16:16:40] <FunkyBob> toolbox_: what do you mean "hide" the controller?
[16:16:54] <FunkyBob> if you insist on bodging MVC terms into the web, then the view is as close as you get
[16:17:08] <FunkyBob> it's the  A in MVA... (or the MC if you call it MVMC)
[16:17:26] <FunkyBob> it's the view's job to process the request and produce the response
[16:17:50] <toolbox_> FunkyBob, I mean that sometimes there is info on the web that Django follows MVC. My question is then, where is the controller in Django?
[16:17:50] <jim> (yeah, the docs are very happy to say what the controller is -not-, but not a word about what it -is-. our billionaire friend would say the docs are not taking nearly enough responsibility to make sure it's understood, and how could it, it would have to ask whether it's being understood, and how it can improve)
[16:18:26] <toolbox_> FunkyBob, I will go back to do the homework an read through the django docs.
[16:18:27] <FunkyBob> toolbox_: forget mvc.. as I said, NOT ANY web server frameworks are MVC
[16:18:39] <FunkyBob> as for what most closely resembles the controller... I told you -- the view
[16:19:39] <dodobrain> FunkyBob, did i tell you that everytime i see problems with django projects those problems are because people tried to do all sorts of weird and funny implementations when they should have been using stock django patterns

[16:19:55] <FunkyBob> dodobrain: wouldn't surprise me
[16:20:11] <dodobrain> most recent being the usage of json fields to store json data when they should have really been using content_types
[16:20:22] <FunkyBob> toolbox_: in your case, the biggest problem you are likely to run into is if your pandas work takes too long
[16:20:33] <FunkyBob> when you'd likely need to introduce a task queue
[16:21:00] <FunkyBob> toolbox_: surely laravel has a system for producing forms and validating their submitted data?
[16:21:34] <toolbox_> FunkyBob, takes 3 sec to process 100.000 rows. That's quick enough for me.
[16:21:42] <FunkyBob> toolbox_: yep, should be fine

[16:35:31] <jim> oh ok
[16:35:44] <jim> it's open, and I have the network tab
[16:36:20] <FunkyBob> now press the submit button

[16:37:24] <jim> I don't see anything moving when I hit submit
[16:37:48] <jim> and this is UserRegisterForm (whidh is the subclass)
[16:37:50] <FunkyBob> this would suggest somehow your HTML is broken
[16:38:12] <FunkyBob> though it shouldn't matter which form class you use, the page should submit
[16:38:25] <FunkyBob> then again, you've involved crispy forms, so who knows what it's rendering
[16:38:33] <jim> ok, let me select the other form
[16:38:47] <FunkyBob> which is why I recommend  you view-source on the page, and make sure the form HTML is valid

[16:39:44] <jim> ok, can I do that by using one of those html validators?
[16:41:00] <FunkyBob> sure, this one has a "validate by direct input" option- https://validator.w3.org/
[16:42:53] <jim> direct input? so my action should go to the validator?
[16:44:01] <FunkyBob> no
[16:44:01] <jim> I can also do it normally, by pasting in the html
[16:44:06] <FunkyBob> yes
[16:44:18] <FunkyBob> view source in your browser, copy, paste, validate
[16:44:31] <jim> ok, I'll do that
[16:46:26] <FunkyBob> and now, I'm off to sleep... it's after midnight, and I have work in the morning
