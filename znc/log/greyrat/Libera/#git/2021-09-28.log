[01:00:27] <ws2k3> im trying to find out what is the best way to store a git repo Inside my git repo. it seems to me that submodule are not what im looking for. since that is only a reference to the actual repo. instead of the whole repo itself.
[01:03:43] <nedbat> ws2k3: can you say more about why you want to do that? it sounds very unusual. there might be an easier way

[01:07:01] <nedbat> ws2k3: what's the inner repo, and what's the outer repo?
[01:07:09] <ws2k3> nedbat: okay i will explaine more. so i like to clone all those repo's into my repo. and them push them to my own git server. so i Allways have a stable point in time where i can go back to
[01:07:23] *** Parts: ZestOfBeans (zestofbean@user/zestofbeans) ()
[01:07:45] <ws2k3> the inner repo are the projects that i clone that i deploy as IaC. the out repo is just a collection of all those repo's + some documentation
[01:07:51] <nedbat> ws2k3: why not just push them to your own git server as separate repos?
[01:08:29] <ws2k3> nedbat: cause that gets messy quickly if i need to maintain many different repo's thats why i was considering to group them together in one repo
[01:08:49] <ws2k3> other devs can look at it i can remove stuff that is obsoleet and add new stuff that is relevant so to speak if that makes sense

[10:42:41] <twb> mithrin: if you mean an SSH certificate, that goes in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the SSH server
[10:42:42] <mithrin> thank you all
[10:42:59] <twb> mithrin: interesting.  Out of curiosity, what OS/distro are you using?
[10:43:44] <mithrin> Windows 10 Enterprise

[15:38:49] <jast> quick reference:
[15:38:50] <jast> !checkout
[15:38:50] <gitinfo> checkout does two different things! (1) no file/path argument: 'git checkout <ref>' = switches to a branch or commit. Uncommitted changes are carried over; if they don't apply cleanly the whole operation rolls back. (2) 'git checkout [<commit>] -- <path>' = overwrites the given files/paths with different versions, from <commit> or (if not given) from the index.
[15:38:51] <jast> !reset
[15:38:52] <gitinfo> reset does two things! (1) without file/path argument: 'git reset [flags] [<commit>]' = make the current branch point to <commit> (default: HEAD). --soft = don't do anything else. --mixed (default) = overwrite the index to match. --hard = overwrite the working files to match. (2) 'git reset [<commit>] -- <path>' = overwrite the index entries for <path> with the content from <commit> (default: HEAD)

[15:42:15] <cousteau> Also, what is reset+checkout supposed to do?  Forget all uncommitted changes (indexed or not)?  Isn't that what reset --hard does?
[15:42:16] <osse> pretty sure it's been around for a fairly long time. But only recently did it start working for e.g. push
[15:42:37] <osse> cousteau: --hard doesn't work for a single file
[15:42:55] <jast> it's easy to get the two different forms of reset mixed up
[15:43:14] <jast> the syntax for checkout and reset is one of the biggest design flaws in Git's CLI IMO
[15:43:23] <cousteau> osse: oh, oops
[15:43:35] <cousteau> Yeah I just saw that in the manpage
[15:44:22] <cousteau> jast: now there's git switch to partly fix the weirdness of checkout
[15:44:40] *** Joins: average (uid473595@user/average)
[15:44:58] <cousteau> But I don't know to which extent it fixes it
[15:45:32] <jast> git switch and git restore each cover a little less than half of what "git checkout" does
[15:45:48] <jast> it's not a good improvement IMO
[15:46:18] <cousteau> Also I don't see why you wouldn't be able to reset --soft/--mixed/--hard a single file.  I mean it should be possible and would make sense, right?
[15:46:40] <osse> those flags only make sense if you change the value of HEAD
[15:46:42] <cousteau> At least reset to the HEAD commit
[15:46:53] <cousteau> Yeah good point
[15:47:20] <osse> I suppose git could accept them if the commit argument is absent or equal to HEAD...

[17:14:38] <cbreak> if this happens while an exception is already being processed, your program will be terminated

[17:16:51] <osse> or are you yanking our chains
[17:17:00] <osse> 12speed dura ace chains
[17:17:14] <jast> I don't really know
[17:17:20] <jast> I think as long as exceptions aren't a thing it's fine
[17:18:58] <osse> If a destructor raises an exception I'd wager that the code you would have to write if destructors weren't a thing would raise an exception too
[17:19:27] <osse> I bet ... ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
[17:19:31] <cbreak> a destructor that raises an exception should also raise an eyebrow or two during code review.
[17:19:54] <jast> the problem is that if you do semi-complex things in a destructor, often it's very hard to see any exceptions it may raise
[17:20:01] <jast> that's also the main downside of exceptions
[17:20:13] <cbreak> it's ok.
[17:20:22] <cbreak> by default, exceptions aren't allowed to leave destructors.
[17:20:29] <jast> at least with a concept like Rust's Result types you'll always be forced to explicitly panic on errors
[17:20:37] <cbreak> so if you screw up handling them inside, it's termination.
[17:20:45] <jast> that's pretty terrible though
[17:20:54] <jast> imagine getting a termination in 1 out of 10000 runs
[17:20:55] <cbreak> why?
[17:21:16] <cbreak> if you fail to handle errors, that's what you get.
[17:21:37] <jast> I'm saying exceptions can make it hard to even be aware of where you might need to handle errors
[17:21:40] <cbreak> -> go handle your errors
[17:21:44] <osse> Speaking of failing, I fail to see how the concept of destructors makes the real life problem any worse than it would be without them
[17:22:04] <jast> well you did start out mentioning a destructor that forks-and-execs :)
[17:22:29] <jast> I don't really want to live in a world where that's a thing
[17:23:02] <cbreak> fork and exec are more a legacy C thing
[17:23:19] <cbreak> it has many problems with non-prehistoric code
[17:23:23] <cbreak> avoid it if possible
[17:23:24] <jast> it's what pretty much everything does under the hood
[17:23:41] <cbreak> there are plenty of alternatives

[17:25:08] <osse> jast: Yeah but that was a meaningless joke :P It was intended to be about as realistic as the concept of deallocating a human
[17:25:09] <jast> AFAIK on Linux there is nothing else except fork() that can create new processes
[17:25:32] <cbreak> vfork with exec
[17:25:34] <cbreak> posix_spawn
[17:25:44] <osse> bro do u even clone()
[17:25:46] <jast> AFAIK posix_spawn wraps fork and exec

[17:26:24] <cbreak> cousteau: why easy to remember?
[17:26:30] <cousteau> But those are kinda hard to come up with
[17:26:57] <cbreak> You can use jrbaCMEook898+DGO09Xh, for free
[17:26:57] <jast> yeah well, in the end clone() does the same thing as fork(), except with more options and slightly different semantics
[17:27:03] <cousteau> Because if they're hard to remember you'll end up writing them down or having to reset the password every time
[17:27:13] <osse> "cousteau and cbreak are fighting over passwords" is long and easy to remember \o/
[17:27:13] <jast> use a password manager, done
[17:27:35] <jast> osse: damn you, stop leaking my master password on IRC

[17:28:04] <cbreak> here, have a new one: 4JVamhqxFBL9nDdDzegB5GYgV. Put it into a password manager, just to be safe.
[17:28:09] <cousteau> I'd say that's a potential security risk
[17:28:18] <cbreak> how so?
[17:28:39] <cbreak> there are various types of password managers, for varying degrees of paranoia
[17:28:39] <jast> getting your remembered passwords confused in your head is a potential security risk, too, just of a different kind
[17:28:47] <cousteau> Writing them down, I mean.  Password managers may or may not be secure enough.  I haven't made up my mind yet.
[17:28:59] <jast> the thing is
[17:29:00] <cbreak> and the stand-alone local-only ones should be more secure than anything you can practically keep into your head reliably
[17:29:22] <jast> I have 361 distinct passwords
[17:29:34] <jast> and that's just for personal accounts
[17:29:44] <jast> there's a limit to how many passwords you can remember and never get mixed up
[17:29:57] <cbreak> cousteau: think about the attacker model first, that should allow you to determine which kind of password manager is acceptable
[17:30:20] <cousteau> Are they the same password with two added letters at the end (each letter having 19 possible variations)?
[17:30:36] <jast> no
[17:30:41] <jast> all of them are randomly generated
[17:30:50] <cousteau> Oh
[17:31:18] <jast> the next best thing instead of a password manager is to generate all of your passwords out of a master password and a "domain" value
[17:31:28] <jast> but then you have to remember which domain value is used where
[17:31:37] <cousteau> So the fact that 19*19=361 was just a coincidence?  Dammit :(

[17:34:19] <jast> a big downside of this is that many services have weird password restrictions
[17:34:34] <jast> some will force you to use a special character from a specific narrow range, some will reject special characters from the same range, etc.
[17:34:57] <jast> some even have a maximum number of characters in a password
[17:35:10] <cousteau> Yeah and some have the fantastic idea of  limiting the MAX length to some ridiculously small value
[17:35:21] <jast> the only sane way to deal with all of that is to use a password manager and having your password DB encrypted with a strong master password
[17:35:38] <cousteau> I remember the "password must have a min length of 6 and a max length of 8" requirement at uni
[17:38:04] <cbreak> cousteau: remember: Getting cleartext access to some of your passwords isn't all that hard
[17:38:19] <cbreak> would access to passwords compromise others?

[17:39:14] <cousteau> Maybe you are right, the thing is that password managers imply (1) me trusting my passwords to software someone else made (kinda easy actually, I'm very little paranoid), (2) lower portability (what if I want to use my password from another PC?), and (3) the fear that they'll somehow access my laptop and figure out my password and then I'm screwed
[17:39:33] <cousteau> None of these would be a real concern if I knew more about security, probably
[17:39:40] <cbreak> 1: You have to trust every web page and application you log in to anyway
[17:39:59] <cbreak> and you have to trust your OS, your browser, ... this is one more software to trust

[17:44:20] <samir> Hi Everyone.  I've been trying to get a program called stagit (https://codemadness.org/stagit.html) working on a VPS which hosts a couple of my remote git repositories.
[17:44:29] <samir> In the stagit documentation, it mentions having a `url` file, `owner` file and `description` file.  This enables you to specify a clone URL, show the repo's owner and a description of the repo, respectively.
[17:44:44] <samir> I'm familiar with the `description` file as I see one created every time I run `git init --bare` in a remote repo.  But I have never seen the `url` file or `owner` file.
[17:45:04] <samir> Are those maintained just in the local repository under `repo/.git`?  Or are they managed in the remote repo with all of the other files such as `config`, `description`, `hooks`, etc?

[17:48:59] <samir> osse: will try that.  Would they be in the local repo or remote repo?
[17:48:59] <osse> they are not
[17:49:16] <samir> ok
[17:49:46] *** Joins: hackinghorn (~hackingho@user/hackinghorn)
[17:50:26] <osse> surely it must be in the repo that stagit generates from
[17:52:43] <samir> osse: yeah, I think you are right.  I have stagit running in the VPS (remote repo).  It looks like it can pick up the git clone url from the `url` file from there.  Will try the same thing for the owner.
[17:52:46] <samir> Thanks!

[17:55:33] <cousteau> Yes, if it's not something specific to git I wouldn't expect it to be in the .git directory, but on a regular file within the project

[18:02:41] <cousteau> So if you clone a project from GitHub that has those config files, they will be cloned as well, and if you upload the project to another GitHub repo it'll preserve those files.  From git's point of view, they're just regular files in the project.

[18:23:38] <jast> samir: I think they did it this way because stagit also supports bare repositories. there is no officially defined way to put custom metadata in a bare repository, so the options you have is adding it to the config file or just creating another plain file next to it (like the "description" file). git itself ignores these.

[18:37:12] <samir> jast: Thanks!  You all have been very helpful!  I think I need to crack open https://git-scm.com/book
[18:37:41] <jast> you wouldn't get any specific information about these files in the book, though, because they're not a standard thing in git :)
[18:37:52] <samir> good point!
[18:38:04] <jast> that said, reading up a bit probably can't hurt
[18:38:17] <samir> I'm not a developer or programmer but feel that it would be good to put some of my files and documents under version control
[18:38:17] <jast> but we're also happy to explain things you find confusing, or point you to more material
[18:38:32] <samir> and given the ubiquity of git, that would be a good way to go
[18:38:33] <jast> sure, that can definitely be useful
[18:38:42] <samir> Thanks, jast!
[18:38:48] <jast> a git repository tends to work best if all of the files in a repo are related
[18:39:05] <jast> but it's not an absolute requirement if you don't plan on doing things like, say, branching
[18:40:13] <samir> branching is probably a feature I don't need at the moment.  My biggest "need" is being able to revert back to a prior version of a file or document
[18:40:27] <jast> sure, that's always an option with git
[18:40:30] <samir> say I updated a config file or "dotfile" and things went bad
[18:40:34] *** Joins: elkalamar (elkalamar@gateway/vpn/airvpn/elkalamar)
[18:40:41] <jast> it's more geared towards reverting everything back, but both things are possible
[18:41:35] <samir> right now, I have files like `program.conf.1`, `program.conf.bak`, `program.conf.crap`, etc.
[18:41:46] <jast> yeah, that's no way to live :-)
[18:41:59] <samir> sad, but true
[18:42:38] <jast> preprint2 of final Thesis draft2 - Copy.docx
[18:42:50] <samir> LOL!

[18:44:09] <ikke> and Really Final
[18:44:09] <jast> also, remember to store a subtly different and slightly more up-to-date copy in the temp/ subdir
[18:44:36] <jast> anyway
[18:45:07] <jast> the most important thing in versioning things with git is that if you ever want to look back, you'll appreciate having written good commit messages that briefly describe the changes and your motivation for making them

[21:40:56] <nvmd> ok so how can one move around in a repo with submodules without getting "failed to unpack tree object ..." and "Submodule X could not be updated"?

[21:43:03] <nvmd> at this point I've had so many issues with submodules I wonder why people ever bothered adding it to git

[23:17:55] <drew> I want to cherry-pick the two patches at the tip of one branch to the current branch. Would that be `git cherry-pick my_branch:HEAD~2..HEAD` ?

[23:32:43] <drew> thanks osse
[23:35:43] <osse> drew: cherry-pick (along with most commands) do their changes on the current branch, so all you need is a way to specify the commits you want to cherry-pick
[23:36:24] <osse> my_branch:HEAD is invented syntax :P I guess it means the HEAD of my_branch. but "my_branch" alone is the head (lowercase) of my_branch, and HEAD (uppercase) always means the current commit absolutely
