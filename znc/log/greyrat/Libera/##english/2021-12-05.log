[05:01:48] <darsie> A gun is a ranged weapon designed to use a shooting tube (gun barrel) to launch typically solid projectiles,[1] but can also project pressurized liquid (e.g. water guns/cannons, spray guns for painting or pressure washing, projected water disruptors, and technically also flamethrowers), gas (e.g. light-gas gun) or even charged particles (e.g. plasma gun).
[05:02:31] <darsie> Light gas guns shoot bullets, not gas.

[07:53:38] <wwwi> if the question is: Where do you send letters? And the answer is: From the post office. Is that correct?
[07:53:58] <Me-me> Generally the implication would be where you would send them "to".

[07:55:05] <wwwi> so, the answer is: To the post office.?
[07:56:06] <twb> Here in Australia, a letter is generally posted by inserting a stamped envelope into a postbox, which is a big read metal barrel in the street.  Later, a postie collects it, takes it to a sorting office, it gets sorted, and another postie puts it in someone's letterbox (a small box outside each house).
[07:56:17] <twb> s/big read/big red/
[07:56:17] <chat> twb meant to say: Here in Australia, a letter is generally posted by inserting a stamped envelope into a postbox, which is a big red metal barrel in the street.  Later, a postie collects it, takes it to a sorting office, it gets sorted, and another postie puts it in someone's letterbox (a small box outside each house).
[07:56:48] <twb> One would not normally take a _letter_ to a post office at all.
[07:57:47] <Tanuki> That's interesting. Does that option exist, though? Like, can someone walk into a post office, hand the letter to some clerk, pay for the stamp?
[07:57:49] <twb> But a small parcel requires a more expensive plastic envelope, which you buy at the post office.  So if you did not post parcels often, you might go to the post office, buy the envelope, put the parcel inside, address it, and give it to the clerk -- rather than going outside and putting it in a red barrel
[07:57:53] <twb> Tanuki: yes
[07:58:06] <wwwi> twb, suppose you take a letter to a post office. If the question is: Where do you send letters? The correct answer is: To the post office?
[07:58:17] <twb> The plastic envelopes are more expensive because they are pre-franked, i.e. the envelope itself replaces the stamp
[07:58:46] <twb> wwwi: I mean... I sort of understand what you're trying to say, but it doesn't quite fit.
[07:58:53] <Tanuki> I don't think we have plastic envelopes. We have paper ones, and you need to stick a stamp on it.

[08:00:49] <Tanuki> Oh, a parcel.
[08:00:52] <twb> The envelopes are just standard white paper in ISO 216
[08:01:00] <Tanuki> I see.
[08:01:29] <twb> 95% of post in australia is business related (i.e. utility bills &c)
[08:01:45] <twb> So a human being would not normally post a letter at all
[08:01:46] <Tanuki> And I bet a lot of that is done with apps, now.
[08:01:48] <Tanuki> Or email.
[08:02:46] <twb> Australia Post is a government-owned for-profit company that has a monopoly on letter delivery in return for guaranteeing to deliver letters to everywhere Australia (not just where it is profitable)
[08:03:02] <twb> But they operate at a loss since about 1980 because nobody needs letters anymore
[08:04:26] <twb> Until 1990 or so they also owned and ran the telephone network
[08:04:51] <twb> That part was profitable, so it was sold to give tax cuts to evil men
[08:05:29] <Tanuki> Sounds like the monopoly we had here with Ma Bell.
[08:05:47] <twb> We actually learned from that and had a good plan to avoid it
[08:06:04] <twb> The wholesale would be owned and operated by the state, and retail would operate in capitalist competition
[08:06:42] <twb> This was a good plan that would have worked, but the same people who sold the original network, got into power again, and bought the unusable copper back off the people they sold it to, for much more money
[08:07:44] <twb> Since that copper was no good, private companies started laying their own competing optical fibre runs
[08:08:12] <twb> So we are back in the situation where city people have three lines of fibre running down the same street, and suburban and country people have nothing

[18:42:01] <GuiToris> thanks :)
[18:44:38] <kurahaupo> Or just "It's time to put up the christmas tree." (Conical pine trees are rare around here, and probably prohibited as bio hazards, so "a christmas tree" means a vaguely tree-shaped assemblage of tinsel.)
[18:45:55] <Tanuki> Christmas* there should be capitalized.
[18:46:15] <kurahaupo> Tanuki: that depends on one's religious affiliations
[18:46:49] <Tanuki> Isn't it always capitalized? For example -- even if you're not a believer, if you mean the God of the monotheistic faiths, you'd still write it with a capital G, right?
[18:47:04] <kurahaupo> not me, no
[18:47:29] <kurahaupo> no more than I'd write "fairy" or "gnome" with a capital.
[18:47:57] <Tanuki> Interesting. I always thought that, as a question of orthographic correction, it would always be capitalized, regardless of the speaker's personal beliefs (or lack thereof.)
[18:47:59] <kurahaupo> "God" is not a proper noun.
[18:48:37] <Tanuki> One of the reasons I asked is also because you used "Christmas" when answering GuiToris before, but switched to "christmas" later, so that was a bit confusing.
[18:48:38] <kurahaupo> If it were then of course I'd capitalise it, but the holy books go to great lengths to point out that it's not a name.
[18:49:27] <kurahaupo> I used the capitalised version because that's what my swipe keyboard produces by default. I went to the trouble of fixing it on the second iteration.
[18:49:43] <Tanuki> Ohhhh, I see.
[18:49:46] <Tanuki> That explains that.
