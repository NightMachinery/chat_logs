[00:36:26] <ayecee> well i mean aside from installing a package manager separate from your distro's package manager

[04:11:08] <hi^-^> you get how it works?
[04:11:22] <Dagmar> Passwords are stored on remote sites both hashed because hash functions are generally not-reversible, but also *salted* because this makes it impossible to just _look up precomputed hashes_
[04:11:44] <schuelermine> hi^-^: Your proposed solution for password generation is vulnerable because it can be performed by an attacker to get your passwords.
[04:11:45] <Dagmar> A large pile of precomputed hashes is a thing called a "rainbow table"
[04:11:46] <schuelermine> This is true unless you use a salt to mix it up, at which point it’s basically what password managers do, just slightly more insecure

[04:15:49] <Dagmar> Behold the magic
[04:15:53] <schuelermine> Dagmar: it does mean your message trying to expose them as daft was daft
[04:15:57] <Psi-Jack> For simple hashing, SHA2-256 is actually pretty good, because between SHA2-512 and SHA2-256, SHA2-256 was actually designed to be computationally more slow than that of 512. So I've read in many technical articles. So hashing passwords comes with a cost of more cycles to repeatedly hash a password in that to try to make a brute force match.
[04:16:02] <schuelermine> regardless of if they’re daft
[04:16:15] <Dagmar> schuelermine: No it just means you're probably not qualified to make these determinations

[04:20:54] <schuelermine> Psi-Jack: oh, bollocks, this library I’m using defaults to 10

[05:07:35] <hi^-^> Dagmar: also, if the website keeps your plain-text password, maybe in case it is compromised or you are being phished, they can't use it to guess what kinds of passwords you choose, or try them on other accounts of yours on other places.
[05:08:10] <hi^-^> _without_ the need of memorising many passwords, or using one password on more than one place
[05:08:23] <hi^-^> also people do remotely brute-force stuff.
[05:08:43] <sheep> just use a password manager. It memorises the passwords for you and prevents reuse
[05:08:59] <hi^-^> sheep: yes, i sent a message about that as well
[05:09:04] <onelegend> make sure you're using an open source password manager
[05:09:26] <felco> if you hash you password before sending feeding it to the site... then your password is the hash, right?
[05:09:29] <sheep> make backups and use an offline password manager
[05:09:32] <onelegend> felco: yup
[05:09:32] <hi^-^> sheep:  the point is that if you lost your storage, the password manager will be no good. if you stored the encrypted passwords in online storage, if the online storage goes out of service it will paralyze your life, your device can be stolen, you can get phished, and all that depending on how your password manager works.

[05:09:56] <sheep> hi^-^: if you can't memorize things or you get retrograde amnesia you'll lose the passwords too
[05:09:56] <hi^-^> sheep: the point of what i say is: you can keep everything in your brain, and it is in some ways better than the usual passwords you keep in your brain. not optimal security, but helps.
[05:10:02] <rascul> multiple backups
[05:10:33] <felco> trip

[05:56:43] <Skaface> im going to have a look at that now
[05:56:45] <Dagmar> You can be slightly more gnomic (confusing) by using grep's ability to return 1 or 0 based on whether or not it matched anything
[05:56:52] <Dagmar> ...but oit'
[05:56:57] <jim> some dists will look at certain shell scripts, to see if they have something like [[... and if so, they will complain if they don't also have #!/usr/bin/bash
[05:57:02] <Dagmar> ...but it's slightly faster than a string comparison
[05:57:03] <rascul> some editors are capable of having shellcheck as a plugin or something so your code is checked automatically
[05:57:12] <jim> (or wherever it is on yoiur system)
[05:57:15] <Dagmar> Won't really matter until you're in a loop doing it a hundred thousand times in a row

[08:02:12] <Psi-Jack> Once you shuck, usually the enclosure is destroyed in the process.
[08:02:19] <bindi> if the HDD is fine and only the USB bridge hardware is dead, then yes, it will work
[08:02:19] <Psi-Jack> heh
[08:02:36] <bindi> but yes then you're left with an internal HDD
[08:02:42] <bindi> as opposed to the external HDD you used to have
[08:02:46] <bindi> but at least you can save your files
[08:02:49] <Psi-Jack> Or externally dockable HDD, depending on if you have an external HDD dock. 🙂

So maybe it will pick up with this device.
[08:13:09] <Psi-Jack> Powerhouse6666: Yeah. The unfortunate side effect is a lot of those style docks, tend to die... If you keep then plugged in.
[08:13:46] <Psi-Jack> So, my recommendation is. Unplug it when not in use. 😉
[08:14:16] <Powerhouse6666> Psi-Jack, I see, thanks.  Yeah Secure reliable infrastructure is #1.  Got any suggestions or wondering if I should just buy one of these USB cables

[12:30:55] <akik> lockywolf: is this about the sysctl rp_filter ?
[12:31:19] <rudi_s> lockywolf: ping will only print packets it sent (details are a little more complex).
[12:31:28] <rudi_s> Use tcpdump icmp if you want to see if another host receives those packets.

[13:22:36] <DPA> But I used to have a similar issue one once. I had a VM with an interface in my dmz and in my lan, for my network share & DLNA server. DMZ->LAN access was blocked, LAN->DMZ access was possible, but DLNA/mDNS stuff needed multicast, which doesn't route.
[13:22:36] <DPA> DMZ needed access to files too. Then when I accessed the NFS on it over the DMZ interface, it went LAN PC <-> firewall <-> DMZ if server, but the server also saw the packages on the lan if,
[13:22:36] <DPA> and eventually got the destination over arp, so it decided to send them back over the lan if. The LAN PC then dropped the packages, because the source mac was wrong (server lan if, instead of firewall lan if mac). So I just blocked DMZ if access from lan to that server.

[14:56:55] <MrElendig> it allows you to have a "repo" of random distroes
[14:56:57] <hexnewbie> It's quote possible that "$file" is a result of *.filepart expansion, and you're emulating nullglob by checking if it remained a pattern (i.e. wasn't expanded)

[16:24:42] *** dtest is now known as dtest2
[16:24:43] <geirha> My guess would be that the PATH entry contains ~, which works in bash, but most other programs treat tilde literally, not as your homedir

[17:34:12] <peetaur> if it's badly fragmented, it can affect speed a bit. And if it's at the start vs end of disk, it can also (start is the outer tracks which are larger so have more space so more size/rotation).

[17:41:01] <DPA> Now, what should I do about that message? Should I exclude that hdd from being watched by smartd, and wait for it to fully fail? Or can I maybe tell it to only tell me if it gets worse?

This doesn't occur if I delete something from  /home/superkuh/rob/video, if I do that it goes to /home/superkuh/rob/.Trash-1000/ as expected.

[18:18:06] <Psi-Jack> That seems.... Unusual.
[18:18:27] <hexnewbie> superkuh: bind mounts in your home directory are weird (though if I'm reading this correctly they ought to be more or less indistinguishable from userspace), and bind mounts can affect checks for mountpoints (in fact, without statx() sometimes they can prevent them entirely)

[18:19:08] <superkuh> Computer1_HDD1 has a folder that I use a bind mount to place within a directory on Computer1_HDD2. If I browser to Computer1_HDD2 and delete a file instead of going to either volume's trash or my home local trash it goes over NFS to a Computer2_HDD1 trash.

[22:12:11] <Dagmar> The performance on var .= othervar always kinda sucks because there's no such thing as "simply appending" to a sequence of bytes in memory unless you are also managing memory directly
[22:12:13] <xx> Dagmar: I solved the mystery from the JPG having larger filesize than the PDF it was in. Somehow the pdf was created with /Filter[/FlateDecode/DCTDecode] so the JPG was not just embedded in it, but also additionally compressed with zlib.
[22:12:29] <MrElendig> onelegend: and then netgate decided to ship it anyway
[22:12:55] <xx> all is well now that only a single /Filter is in use
[22:12:58] <Dagmar> Simply appending a new item to an array just adds a pointer to a list that's already generally expected to thrash around quite a bit so it's _already_ had the space for several new pointers ready to go

[23:37:41] <dostoyevsky2> When you have a k8s cluster, you want your proxy to update the routing when you destroy pods etc or create new ones... but for that you need to dynamically reconfigure... so: cronjob: create new haproxy.conf && pkill -HUP haproxy....
