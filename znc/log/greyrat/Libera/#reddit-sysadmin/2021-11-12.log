[01:14:25] <signalblue> !flyfacts
[01:14:25] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!
[01:14:29] <signalblue> !flyfacts
[01:14:29] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies live on a liquid diet! Yes, thats correct. Flies tend to live off a diet based on liquids. Why? Well, that’s just how they are built. See, they lack the mouthparts needed to chew food, so instead, they have to drink it.
[01:14:31] <signalblue> !flyfacts
[01:14:32] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies don’t have teeth. Instead, they have a long tongue called a proboscis, which sucks up food like a straw. Some flies drink nectar or blood. House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!

[07:35:38] <TurkeyGibby> sorry, what was that cryptic1?
[07:35:50] <cryptic1> !flyfact
[07:35:50] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Unlike other insects that have two pairs of wings, house fly has only one pair of membranous wings. Second pair of wings is reduced and looks like a pair of miniature drumsticks. This pair of wings (known as halters) is used for balancing during the flying process.
[07:38:22] <TurkeyGibby> !flyfact
[07:38:22] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!

[11:19:34] <SirSceptalot> lol
[11:20:20] <Hunterkll> A-KO: so hows that AMD workin out for ya
[11:20:23] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:20:39] <A-KO> Hunterkll: This was my own dumb fault really
[11:20:45] <A-KO> I enabled a feature that killed my keyboard in the bios
[11:20:46] <A-KO> lol
[11:20:54] <Hunterkll> ..............
[11:21:07] * Hunterkll glances at CMOS reset pushbutton
[11:21:11] <A-KO> I also wanted to connect the cpu fan's splitter so I could have on header control both fans rather than using 2 headers.
[11:21:31] <A-KO> yeah, uh. because they didn't have the board I wanted when I bought this, I had to buy 1 tier lower--$30 less, and no bios push button :(
[11:21:35] <A-KO> SCREWDRIVER HEADER FTW
[11:21:37] <A-KO> anyways
[11:21:42] <A-KO> it's all good now
[11:21:48] <Hunterkll> shit i have like
[11:21:49] <Hunterkll> 4 pushbuttons
[11:21:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:21:54] <A-KO> this might be the last gigabyte board I ever buy, though
[11:21:56] <Hunterkll> one just to reset/redo memory calibration 
[11:21:56] <Hunterkll> lmao
[11:21:57] <A-KO> I might switch back to asus
[11:22:02] <Hunterkll> eh
[11:22:06] <Hunterkll> gigabyte, asus, either way
[11:22:10] <A-KO> their quality has gone down substantially IMO
[11:22:13] <Hunterkll> i wouldn't go less than the top board for the socket they have
[11:22:19] <Hunterkll> my gigabyte UD4 is great
[11:22:26] <Hunterkll> just didn't have the feature set i wanted
[11:22:29] <A-KO> it's nice having quiet fans again lol
[11:22:38] <Hunterkll> got the gigabyte UD4 Pro for my spare X299 system
[11:22:39] <A-KO> that's why I wanted to fix it so I could adjust the fan settings again
[11:22:40] <Hunterkll> because you know
[11:22:46] <Hunterkll> we all have spare HEDT systems laying around, right?
[11:22:46] <A-KO> gigabyte's driver doesn't like windows 11
[11:22:52] <A-KO> GSOD on insider
[11:23:01] <A-KO> and if I have hvci enabled? it won't even load the driver
[11:23:09] <Hunterkll> https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/X299-UD4-Pro-rev-10#kf
[11:23:10] <A-KO> so I have to control the fan curves from the bios
[11:23:12] <Hunterkll> ^ that's the spare board i have
[11:23:15] <Hunterkll> got it for free, actually
[11:23:17] <Hunterkll> well
[11:23:19] <Hunterkll> after I sold it on ebay
[11:23:24] <Hunterkll> it got lost in the mail so long insurance paid out
[11:23:28] <Hunterkll> then one day USPS r eturned it to me
[11:23:29] <Hunterkll> :P
[11:23:50] <A-KO> at any rate
[11:23:52] <A-KO> shit's good now
[11:23:59] <A-KO> just wanted to stop one set of fans from spinning up too much
[11:24:10] <A-KO> it's reasonable now
[11:24:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:24:27] <Hunterkll> i need to replace the rattler in my case
[11:24:33] <Hunterkll> i've had the replacement noctua for.... too long
[11:24:53] <Hunterkll> yea
[11:24:56] <Hunterkll> i ordered the replacement fan in may
[11:25:07] <Hunterkll> it's the only non-noctua fan in the system - one of the OEM case fans 
[11:25:11] <Hunterkll> that i slapped onthe radiator
[11:25:35] <A-KO> lol nice
[11:25:41] <A-KO> ahhh it's nice having predictable fan noise now

[12:33:56] <Hunterkll> anyway
[12:34:06] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: the idea is to properly separate them based on areas of performance, primarily
[12:34:33] <Hunterkll> idea being - each drive can be put on different tier of storage 
[12:34:39] <Hunterkll> TLOGs you want to be lightning fast, for example
[12:34:44] <Hunterkll> otherwise you're holding up the main DB itself 
[12:34:52] <Hunterkll> main DB will have less activity than the TLOGs
[12:34:59] <Hunterkll> system DBs will have a weird mix of iops reqs
[12:35:20] <Hunterkll> now mind you - if you're just using one class of storage, none of this "really" matters
[12:35:40] <BWMerlin> It is one class of storage
[12:35:47] <Hunterkll> but yet, it still can matter
[12:35:54] <Hunterkll> say your tlogs spiral out of control
[12:36:00] <Hunterkll> having them on a sepoarate drive limits the growth they can do
[12:36:13] <Hunterkll> which makes cleanup easier, and alerts you to the problem (by taking down the DB) faster 
[12:36:27] <Hunterkll> instead of having to do fucking jedi surgery on 1.5TB tlogs on a 50GB database
[12:37:02] <Hunterkll> and, who knows how long it might actually live? A real DBA might get it down the road on real storage and be put through hell for it not being done "right" first off the bat
[12:37:30] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> help, I would love to learn something rather useless:
[12:37:30] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> 64bit is a quad word are there names for 128 or 256bit words?
[12:37:54] <BWMerlin> As the usage is going to be small (sql express would probably be enough) would it be "safe" to just put the DB and logs onto "D" drive and leave the SQL install and OS on the "C" drive?
[12:37:57] <Hunterkll> depends on platform actually because 'word' can mean different :P
[12:37:59] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I saw "octa word" and "double quad word" for 128 but from there, there is nothing
[12:38:12] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> x64
[12:38:20] <catbeard> give them the D:
[12:38:23] <Hunterkll> but
[12:38:26] <Hunterkll> @Flyingsky https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)
[12:38:28] <Hunterkll> i'd start there
[12:39:14] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: well, again, it all depends - and keep in mind, with VMs, you can always expand drives as needed 
[12:39:17] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> Thank you
[12:40:00] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: things you might want to consider too - the storage where the database itself is, format it with 64K clusters 
[12:40:05] <Hunterkll> instead of standard 4K (if using NTFS)
[12:40:30] <Hunterkll> ideally, you want OS/Application/Data/Log/tempDB volumes 
[12:40:37] <BWMerlin> If I shut down the server and the DB and logs are on D drive, can I just run up a new OS install, connect the D drive, import the DB and go on my way?
[12:40:54] <Hunterkll> if you shut it down *properly* you don't need the logs at all
[12:41:11] <Hunterkll> tlogs are point in time recovery method 
[12:41:22] <BWMerlin> Okay, I think I will go two drives, OS and SQL install and DB and log drive
[12:41:30] <Hunterkll> i don't reccomend it 
[12:41:40] <Hunterkll> doing it that way
[12:42:18] <BWMerlin> Our usage is very small, without blowing things up into a massive over engineering feat what would you recommend?
[12:42:23] <Hunterkll> doing it the "right" way staves off long term implications 
[12:42:30] <Hunterkll> well, this is just a bog standard SQL setup
[12:42:40] <Hunterkll> we make all our SQL servers this way, even if it's a 1GB database
[12:42:42] <BWMerlin> It will be used for veeam and after that maybe WSUS (that is a maybe)
[12:42:45] <Hunterkll> saner/easier to support
[12:43:06] <Hunterkll> what version of SQL is intended?
[12:43:12] <BWMerlin> 2019
[12:43:22] <Hunterkll> ah very good
[12:43:52] <Hunterkll> so I suppose i'd go with a 5 disk layout, if you don't care about C: size 
[12:44:04] <Hunterkll> We care about C: size because of the "included" disk with azure/AWS VMs
[12:44:07] <Hunterkll> otherwise, not too important
[12:44:11] <Hunterkll> Disk 1: OS/SQL
[12:44:15] <Hunterkll> Disk 2: Sysdb
[12:44:17] <Hunterkll> disk 3: tempdb
[12:44:20] <Hunterkll> disk 4: databases
[12:44:23] <Hunterkll> disk 5: tlogs
[12:44:40] *** Joins: nun (~nun@178.115.236.156.static.drei.at)
[12:44:40] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v nun
[12:44:44] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: this layout also allows you to use say, perfmon, if you're having issues, to identify *what* the problem is
[12:45:02] <Hunterkll> all on one disk, you can't isolate what may be causing an SQL storm easily wi thout advanced DBA knowledge
[12:45:43] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: the big reason here really is also troubleshooting 
[12:45:58] <Hunterkll> like say WSUS is destroying your perf, but you have no idea why
[12:45:58] <BWMerlin> Kind of hoping that the application developers (we are a school so we will be using commercial products like veeam and WSUS etc) have done their job so I don't have to dig through that
[12:46:08] <Hunterkll> well, that's not necessarily the case
[12:46:20] <Hunterkll> because of config variables, reeal world, no plan survives contact with the enemy, etc
[12:46:30] <Hunterkll> it also helps you when the vendor's hand holding you
[12:47:53] <Hunterkll> mind you - i don't always do this - but if it's going to be a *shared* instance (even potentially) then hell yes
[12:48:40] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: with this layout, you drop *any* DBA or support agent into the environment, they'll be right at home 
[12:49:18] <Oliber> in that layout,. do you keep both the tempdb mdf and tlog on the same disk? or keep the tempdb tlog with the others?
[12:49:25] <Hunterkll> Oliber: yes, same disk
[12:49:36] <Hunterkll> disk 5 is just *user* database tlogs
[12:49:51] <Hunterkll> tempdb has its own size limits and c ontrols and can fuck off on its own
[12:49:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:50:27] <Oliber> yeah makes sense, we've had some stange behaviour in the past where tempdb got very excited
[12:50:35] <Hunterkll> yep, but even so
[12:50:44] <Hunterkll> having tempdb on its own makes pinpointing that using perfomon super easy
[12:50:49] <Hunterkll> "okay, it's tempdb, we can go from here"
[12:51:37] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: you may wish to review this: https://www.solsoftsolutions.com/blog/2017/4/23/sql-server-setup-checklist
[12:51:47] <Hunterkll> that shows mostly the configuration i'm talking about 
[12:52:02] <Hunterkll> only thing is they leave tempdb on the C: drive
[12:52:02] *** Quits: cation (cation@user/cation) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:52:11] <Hunterkll> which again, moving tempdb out is a troubleshooting and performance fix
[12:52:36] <Hunterkll> for data and log volumes, use 64KB cluster sizese
[12:52:45] <Hunterkll> SQL does I/O in 8KB and 64KB chunks 
[12:52:56] <Hunterkll> so 4K means you're hitting twice if it's an 8KB hit 
[12:53:28] <BWMerlin> I don't remember getting those options in Hyper-V when creating a disc
[12:53:38] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: you don't
[12:53:43] <Hunterkll> that's when you format it inside the VM
[12:53:59] <Hunterkll> hyper-v doesn't format the disks
[12:54:12] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: i'm not talking about physical sector size, i'm talking about cluster size in the file system

[12:55:50] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> Ah performance
[12:55:58] <Hunterkll> @VALOS SQL works in 8K or 64K chunks period, nothing higher
[12:56:03] <Hunterkll> so 64K is optimal
[12:56:11] <Hunterkll> it only does 8K when it's slow and has nothing large/queued to write

[12:58:48] <Hunterkll> SQL, just like any other complex product, can be a mythical beast until you tame it

[13:00:04] <Hunterkll> it basically runs itself

[13:04:30] <Hunterkll> https://www.solsoftsolutions.com/blog/2017/4/23/sql-server-setup-checklist
[13:04:45] <Hunterkll> there's a *reason* each of  these t hings is a separate area in the SQL server installer
[13:04:49] <Hunterkll> because you're meant to change them
[13:05:12] <Hunterkll> doing everything on one drive is possible, yes, but even MS will go "wtf?"
[13:05:23] <Hunterkll> even their documentation goes "wtf?" 
[13:09:09] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: anyway, this is how   SQL server is designed to operate, so *shrug*
[13:09:28] <Hunterkll> you do you - just giving what any competent SQL admin would expect to see and  mitigates a shitload of issues
[13:09:47] <xe0n> i hope you've factored into your design plan how you're going to test backups regularly

[13:16:40] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: i mean, even on server core, setup.exe with all the arguments to configure everything is just one line
[13:17:32] <BWMerlin> I have a server core install, doing a manual step through in sandbox and then will make a new sandbox and command line it to test and then deploy to prod
[13:17:47] <Hunterkll> i mean, i think the gui installer works on core too though
[13:17:50] <Hunterkll> so no real need?

[13:20:00] <xe0n> https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lf5rkuBqAI1qztjn5o1_500.gif
[13:20:21] <Hunterkll> i used the shit out of my newton to take notes when i was in the office 
[13:20:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:21:43] <xe0n> you've read how to run setup.exe, not how to design a sql box lol
[13:22:10] <xe0n> but ayooo
[13:22:13] <xe0n> i'll come to you when i need a restore
[13:22:16] <BWMerlin> So the order might have been a little backwards
[13:22:31] <xe0n> yeah stop while you're behind
[13:22:56] <Hunterkll> configuration file might be your best bet, i suppose
[13:23:05] <xe0n> yeah ive done it through config file before
[13:24:05] <BWMerlin> I really do want to learn IaC but for now it is the slow way
[13:24:33] <BWMerlin> The goal I have in mind is to only backup data, all servers and services should be templates 
[13:24:40] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: basically, you can set up a gui win server, 99% complete the install, grab the config INI, and use that with setup.exe on server core
[13:25:02] <BWMerlin> That sounds interesting
[13:25:10] <Hunterkll> literally right before you click "install" it gives you a path to ConfigurationFile.ini you can grab
[13:25:20] <BWMerlin> hmm
[13:25:22] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: https://www.softlanding.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture3-480x56.png
[13:25:54] <Hunterkll> so set up a GUI server, but with the correct disk layout/formatting, in the correct domain, wiht the correct service accounts......
[13:25:58] <Hunterkll> then before you actually hit instasll
[13:26:00] <Hunterkll> grab that file
[13:26:05] <Hunterkll> then use that to install on server core
[13:26:27] <Hunterkll> https://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/sql-server-configuration-files
[13:26:29] <BWMerlin> Kind of a shame you cannot remote gui install
[13:27:02] <Hunterkll> you're asking for a lot here given what this product can do :P
[13:27:10] <Hunterkll> that's a stupendously low priority for that team
[13:27:28] <Hunterkll> shaving 2ms off a query on a 3 petabyte database is what they're chasin'
[13:27:54] <Hunterkll> or achiving world record IOPS throughput
[13:27:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:28:31] <Hunterkll> welp, last dungeon roulette i need for the day then 
[13:28:38] <BWMerlin> What game?
[13:28:41] <Hunterkll> FFXIV 
[13:28:50] <Hunterkll> daily roulette bonuses reset at 11AM EST 
[13:29:23] <Hunterkll> but after that i'm gonna jam through a SCOM install so hard it's going to make people's necks break 
[13:29:28] <Hunterkll> told them it was already done tbh :P
[13:29:55] <BWMerlin> Remember the golden rule, deploy to production
[13:30:03] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: the fuck do you think i'm doing? :P
[13:30:19] <Hunterkll> I'm consolidating 3 other SCOM instances in legacy environments into one, and introducing SCOM again to the destination environment
[13:30:54] <Hunterkll> also just outright decomm'ing the test environment one
[13:30:59] <Hunterkll> because i haven't logged into it in like 2-3 years 
[13:32:14] <Hunterkll> xe0n: you should have seen how thirsty some teams got when they heard i was putting up SCOM in  the destination area :P
[13:32:26] <Hunterkll> SCOM? CAN WE USE IT TOO?!!?!?
[13:32:38] <Hunterkll> apparently the current solution is not.... optimal :P
[13:33:00] <BWMerlin> System Centre Orchestration Manager right?
[13:33:24] <Hunterkll> no
[13:33:26] <Hunterkll> operations manager
[13:33:32] <Hunterkll> orchestration is abbreviated SCORCH 
[13:33:51] <Hunterkll> SCOM is the monitoring/diagnostics/automated remediation tool
[13:34:00] <BWMerlin> hmmm, that doesn't sound foreboding at all
[13:34:12] <Hunterkll> think of SCORCH like say, ansible 
[13:34:21] <BWMerlin> Always wanted to play around with SCCM but never had the chance
[13:34:29] <Hunterkll> SCCM has a 180 day trial for lab usage

[14:40:35] <Hunterkll> welp
[14:40:38] <Hunterkll> the ISOs have been moved

[14:40:44] <Hunterkll> so hardcore
[14:42:02] <Hunterkll> don't mind me if i get a little horny, doing proper greenfield datacenter scale deployments like this makes me excite
[14:42:59] <Haise0> lmao

[14:52:29] <Hunterkll> *shrug*
[14:52:32] <Hunterkll> yea it's pretty boring
[14:52:53] <Hunterkll> mainly because SCOM was left high and dry forever in the old environments (Side of company i came from) and basically just used for up/down monitoring
[14:52:56] <SirSceptalot> Hunterkll, you remind me of that cat that explains dns
[14:53:02] <Hunterkll> so i wanted to consolidate them 
[14:53:11] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: i'd love that person to meet the business end of my mossberg
[14:53:13] <Hunterkll> i mean what
[14:53:18] <Haise0> I wouldn't mind solving Solaris issues 
[14:53:22] <Hunterkll> well
[14:53:24] <Hunterkll> its dumb shit
[14:53:27] <Hunterkll> like exports mounts failing
[14:53:27] <Haise0> or Linux/AIX issues 
[14:53:30] <Haise0> oh lol
[14:53:31] <Haise0> NFS stuff
[14:53:31] <Hunterkll> no shit that volume is full you moron 
[14:53:33] <Hunterkll> no
[14:53:36] <Hunterkll> not that exports
[14:53:40] <Haise0> oh ?
[14:53:48] <Hunterkll> local user home direcotries in /exports on zfs vols 
[14:53:50] <Hunterkll> etc
[14:53:52] <Haise0> ah
[14:53:58] <Hunterkll> they *mount* in /exports 
[14:54:02] <Hunterkll> and there's a whole system how it handles it
[14:54:09] <Hunterkll> yes, it's meant for transparency/NFS/etc but 
[14:54:14] <Hunterkll> it's also 100% used locally without NFS
[14:54:30] *** Joins: Gaboradon (~Gaboradon@cpe-86-58-57-5.static.triera.net)
[14:54:50] <Haise0> Solaris's /exports is equivalent of Linux's /home if I understand right ?
[14:54:56] <Hunterkll> nope
[14:54:58] <Hunterkll> solaris uses /home
[14:54:59] <Hunterkll> ;)
[14:55:03] <Haise0> oh okay
[14:55:10] <Haise0> its time to rtfm lol
[14:55:36] <Hunterkll> don't do it
[14:55:47] <Hunterkll> you'll dive so deep into automounter and autofs 
[14:55:54] <Hunterkll> you may never come back the same
[14:56:25] <Hunterkll> now you CAN set it up to use /home .... the way you normally thi nk of
[14:56:37] <Hunterkll> but then... if it's not in /export... how can you use your home directory on other systems?
[14:57:02] <Hunterkll> remember kids
[14:57:04] <Hunterkll> the network is the computer
[14:57:05] <Hunterkll> ;)
[14:57:20] <Haise0> is it really a bad thing though to read on autofs and automounter ? 
[14:57:42] <Hunterkll> it'll make you go "WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY THINKING THIS IS RETARDED" and "WHY THE FUCK DONT WE DO THAT" at the same time
[14:57:50] <Hunterkll> the cognitive dissonance without deeper understanding 
[14:57:57] <Hunterkll> will turn you into a QBASIC programmer

[15:00:50] <Haise0> wait /home is automount of /export/home
[15:01:00] <Hunterkll> basically, yes

[15:32:19] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> you used a physical fork

[15:32:44] <Hunterkll> then gave up and just straight up used a hammer
[15:32:58] <Hunterkll> man i paid like $2500 for that thing in 2015/2016 
[15:32:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:33:10] <Haise0> $$$
[15:33:13] <Hunterkll> i was gonna get my enjoyment before sending it in
[15:33:49] <Hunterkll> at least the case has the right serial number
[15:33:53] <Hunterkll> .............
[15:33:57] <Hunterkll> which is actually incorrect
[15:34:03] <Hunterkll> because the back case was a replacement
[15:34:06] <Hunterkll> OH WELL
[15:34:16] <Hunterkll> that's why the warranty dates were different in my account than what i remembered!
[15:34:21] <Hunterkll> and the base serial number didn't match
[15:34:26] <Hunterkll> WHATEVER DOESNT MATTER NEW ONE SENT
[15:35:11] <Hunterkll> look they got a full surface book with even the original SSD 
[15:35:20] <Haise0> oh they're downscaling values in FF XIV
[15:35:21] <Hunterkll> and i paid the piper the fee
[15:35:22] <Haise0> hmm
[15:35:30] <Hunterkll> Haise0: yea so you got till the 3rd to level shit etc 
[15:35:54] <Haise0> wait wtf
[15:36:00] <Haise0> When the character database is overwritten upon the release of Patch 6.0, any EXP accumulated between levels beforehand will be reset to zero. This includes:
[15:36:00] <Haise0>     Job/class EXP for Disciples of War and Magic
[15:36:00] <Haise0>     Class EXP for Disciples of the Hand and Land
[15:36:00] <Haise0>     Retainer EXP
[15:36:00] <Haise0>     Trust avatar EXP
[15:36:01] <Hunterkll> before the changes
[15:36:06] <Hunterkll> yes
[15:36:17] <Hunterkll> Haise0: so if you're like, level 60, and are 25% the way leveled to 61
[15:36:23] <Hunterkll> it'll reset to 60 with no xp
[15:36:26] <Haise0> ah

[15:37:21] <Hunterkll> oh well, it auto reg'd to my MS account, and worked out fine 
[15:37:29] <Hunterkll> i think i slag'd down the old case
[15:37:40] <Hunterkll> the power button's welded in plastic-wise, so i had to replace the case
[15:37:53] <Hunterkll> i had been using a resistor to hit the microswitch to turn it on wh en i was still using it before the case swap
[15:37:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:38:14] <Haise0> oh wow, what a great use of resistor lol
[15:38:29] <Hunterkll> well sometimes jumper cable or a paperclip

[17:04:36] <vinrock> someone mentioned it here th eother day
[17:04:37] <vinrock> check it out
[17:05:05] <sintax> oooh
[17:05:20] <sintax> our KACE appliance does it and i hate it. 
[17:05:28] <vinrock> very simple to spin up and dive into without being oversimplified
[17:05:31] <vinrock> ah you have one of those things
[17:05:55] <sintax> yeah...
[17:06:02] <sintax> it's horrid.
[17:06:08] <sintax> i'd rather have a rmm
[17:06:10] <vinrock> i guess thats why dell dropped em
[17:06:23] <sintax> it annoys the shit out of me. 
[17:06:48] <sintax> i could drop that and citrix, get solarwinds or datto or ninja or whatever and then move everyone to a remote desktop gateway and i'd be happy

[17:11:55] <JollyRgrs> so that issue is only with 1809 and lower clients?
[17:12:04] * JollyRgrs didn't read the article
[17:12:25] <xe0n> server 2019 > 2008 r2

[17:13:26] <JollyRgrs> why do they mention win10 1809 then?
[17:13:40] <JollyRgrs> i saw a the blurb about the issues last night going to bed, thought it was all server side stuff
[17:13:40] <xe0n> The list of affected platforms also includes Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2008 SP2.
[17:13:55] <xe0n> guess 1809 client is affected too? shrug
[17:14:27] <xe0n> i guess 10 1809 ltsc 🤷‍
[17:14:30] <JollyRgrs> oh... b/c it's prob the same "base" ... 2019 is tied to 1809 somewhat
[17:14:32] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[17:14:51] <JollyRgrs> they show server 2016 tied to w10 1607
[17:14:56] <xe0n> ++
[17:15:14] <JollyRgrs> that's kind of misleading, but ok
[17:15:33] <xe0n> well we know microsoft has a hard time communicating things sometimes :P

[17:52:21] <JollyRgrs> yup... so over a month ago
[17:52:21] <Activ8> that's office ltsc thought you meant windows 10 ltsc 
[17:52:23] <Activ8> ha
[17:52:32] <JollyRgrs> 2021 isn't a version of w10
[17:52:36] <xe0n> Activ8 gets a boner when he sees ltsc
[17:52:41] <JollyRgrs> there should be no confusion with that
[17:52:42] <Activ8> I get hard as fuck
[17:52:48] <TurkeyGibby> Uhh
[17:52:49] <Activ8> proper rock solid 10/10
[17:52:54] <Activ8> all 18"
[17:52:56] <JollyRgrs> please tell me you have a legit reason to use ltsc in prod
[17:53:01] <JollyRgrs> (hint: there ain't many)
[17:53:05] <Activ8> I don't use it in prod
[17:53:09] <Activ8> I can use what I like 
[17:53:19] <JollyRgrs> ... why bother with ltsc thene?
[17:53:27] <Activ8> because I don't want the shit that comes with 10
[17:53:28] <JollyRgrs> (where'd that last e come from?)
[17:53:35] <Activ8> it's easier NOT to disable things than it is to enable
[17:53:39] <xe0n> He DoEsNt LiKe ThE StOrE aNd ThInKs ItS fAsTeR tHaN SaC
[17:53:41] <JollyRgrs> Activ8: then use hannah montana linux
[17:53:45] <mcj> We use LTSC in prod because it's Long Service
[17:53:49] <Activ8> I'll use your mum
[17:54:03] <mcj> Don't have to mess around with this crap outside of creating the config
[17:54:08] <xe0n> ha jokes on you, your mum likes to stay current with all the dudes she bangs
[17:54:10] <JollyRgrs> mcj: unless you have an actual reason (like installing it on an ATM or POS or something)... that's a lousy reason
[17:54:13] <estranger> *spends a HR on a call explaining X* *gets email later that day asking how to do X*
[17:54:14] <estranger> sigh
[17:54:24] <mcj> The org don't wanna do 365 :(
[17:54:38] <xe0n> you sure the other options selected in other sections are correct?
[17:55:00] <JollyRgrs> is "LTSC" just the new way of the non-subscription Office branding now?
[17:55:00] <xe0n> clean copypasta of the key?
[17:55:08] <mcj> In my config? I'm not reinventing the wheel
[17:55:17] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: yeah, i only set the product and then tried to type the key... i bet that might be it (something else checked is wrong)
[17:55:21] <mcj> FCKGW

[17:55:28] <xe0n> two different builds
[17:55:38] <JollyRgrs> can you try a new config and only select the product and then try to type the key?
[17:55:52] <mcj> Absolutely, let's see.
[17:55:58] <cryptic1> !flyfact
[17:55:58] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Some fly species—including bee flies, hoverflies, and midges—serve as pollinators for a variety of plants that are not attractive to bees. In fact, you can thank midges for satisfying your chocolate craving. These tiny flies are the primary pollinators of the cacao (or cocoa) tree.

[17:56:21] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: only 2021 available in the drop down is LTSC, otherwise it's office 2019
[17:56:22] <cryptic1> oh those midges
[17:56:25] <mcj> Yeah, just selecting the product and then attempting to enter the key works
[17:56:41] <mcj> My only other options selected are to not install OneDrive and OneNote
[17:57:02] <mcj> And accept EULA and close out the apps when installing
[17:57:05] <xe0n> because the 2021 perp is consumer
[17:57:13] <xe0n> ltsc can be used for vl
[17:57:15] <xe0n> :)
[17:58:15] <JollyRgrs> so tick one by one until it crashes
[17:58:26] <JollyRgrs> or maybe typing key in first, it'll let you check all
[17:58:30] <xe0n> no onenote!
[17:58:31] <xe0n> jeeez mang
[17:58:51] <mcj> Windows already includes it
[17:59:01] <xe0n> yeah, and it's deprecated
[17:59:06] <mcj> LOL no shit
[17:59:14] <mcj> Really?
[17:59:18] <Activ8> xe0n you can have my mum 
[17:59:26] <xe0n> yeah, onenote office is getting lots of love
[17:59:27] <Activ8> I'll still be using LTSC
[17:59:30] <xe0n> mary jo reported it the other week
[17:59:43] <xe0n> it even got a fluent icon!
[17:59:43] <xe0n> ;P
[17:59:45] <mcj> They need to decide which version they want to support man
[17:59:51] <xe0n> they have
[17:59:51] <Activ8> I bet you love to bang Mary Jo don't you xe0n
[17:59:53] <Activ8> lol
[17:59:56] <xe0n> oO
[17:59:58] <mcj> I just don't want two OneNotes on users machines
[18:00:07] <xe0n> yeah, then you customise the start menu and remove it lol
[18:00:11] <mcj> Looks like it's not included in Win11 so i'll dump it back in
[18:00:14] <xe0n> remove the temptation
[18:00:16] <PublicWiFi> this shit software only allows admin to change passwords.. not generate a reset... actually change it and give it to them lol
[18:00:19] <xe0n> i dont even think its included with win 11 lol
[18:00:22] <PublicWiFi> developers suck
[18:00:57] <Activ8> what shit software is that?
[18:01:06] <PublicWiFi> chronicall, phone recording software
[18:01:17] <PublicWiFi> its shit software but the alternative was even more shit
[18:01:20] <xe0n> ...makes sense in a call center setting
[18:01:22] <PublicWiFi> and they were both java based... go figure
[18:01:25] <mcj> Looks like the disabling of OneDrive for Desktop is what is causing the crash
[18:01:26] <Activ8> ew java
[18:01:51] <PublicWiFi> why can't a user change their own pw in portal xe0n ? :P
[18:02:03] <xe0n> in a call center setting, could be lots of reasons
[18:02:06] <PublicWiFi> rip
[18:02:08] <xe0n> ie shared terminal setups
[18:02:13] <xe0n> with fixed accounts per machine
[18:02:27] <PublicWiFi> nah you're givng this software too much credit lol
[18:02:35] <PublicWiFi> its just a crappy web portal xD
[18:02:42] <xe0n> i used to manage a call center ;)

[20:25:05] <A-KO> I've never dreamt of smoking cigarettes lol
[20:25:08] <A-KO> but I do dream of work
[20:25:16] <A-KO> last night I dreamt that a coworker stole my box of masks :/ lolol
[20:26:07] <A-KO> ugh, too much shit to do today
[20:26:10] <A-KO> gotta head into the office here
[20:26:11] <A-KO> weeeee
[20:26:12] <vinrock> ugh i gotta go to the mallrats mall
[20:26:15] <TurkeyGibby> its snowing
[20:26:20] <TurkeyGibby> I hate the snow
[20:26:22] <A-KO> mallrats mall? lol
[20:26:25] <A-KO> TurkeyGibby: LA man
[20:26:25] <vinrock> yeah
[20:26:26] <A-KO> :D
[20:26:28] <vinrock> menlo park
[20:26:30] <TurkeyGibby> A-KO: nah
[20:26:33] <signofzeta> A-KO: Box of masks?  Do they make you use the awful-but-effective paper ones?
[20:26:48] <A-KO> signofzeta: yeah. LA has a county-wide mandate for masks indoors
[20:27:01] <signofzeta> A-KO: but you can't use a cloth mask?
[20:27:04] <vinrock> i thought you were in the bay area not down there
[20:27:06] <A-KO> vinrock: that a joke for facebook's campus? lol
[20:27:14] <signofzeta> A-KO: I know it's worse out there.
[20:27:15] <A-KO> nah I'm in OC
[20:27:31] <A-KO> waaaaaaaaaaaay down south
[20:27:36] <A-KO> I do get up to the bay area every so often though
[20:27:38] <vinrock> https://www.minimallycompliantmasks.com/
[20:27:48] <A-KO> oh god lol
[20:27:53] <A-KO> I don't mind wearing masks tbh
[20:27:57] <A-KO> I haven't been sick in 2 years
[20:27:59] <A-KO> it's been fucking glorious
[20:28:06] <signofzeta> Me too!  That's the upside of a pandemic.
[20:28:20] <A-KO> colds fuck me up hardcore usually
[20:28:21] <signofzeta> Also, I like how the model on that website has her nose exposed.
[20:28:26] <vinrock> lol
[20:28:53] <A-KO> I have asthma, or, in the words of the pulmonologist, "reactive airway disease"--meaning when I get a cold it basically fucks up my lungs
[20:29:00] <A-KO> needless to say, I'm triple vaccinated
[20:29:00] <A-KO> lol
[20:29:13] <signofzeta> Me too, A-KO.  My asthma is only mild, though.
[20:29:24] <A-KO> because a simple cold can give me bronchitis, pneumonia, or at *best*, a bad cough for months that won't go away
[20:29:38] <vinrock> eat more garlic
[20:29:44] <A-KO> I eat more garlic than most people garlic
[20:29:44] <signofzeta> But I got my first shot in January 2020, so I was lucky.  Colds don't fuck me up, but as my fiancee calls them, I get "man-colds".
[20:29:58] <A-KO> I literally get garlic cloves on pizzas
[20:30:00] <A-KO> lol
[20:30:02] <vinrock> nice
[20:30:04] <technonerd> the covid cough and the million mile death stare
[20:30:14] <vinrock> i cant believe so many people around here have never had a garic pie
[20:30:17] <A-KO> yeah I have 0 interest in catching covid. I'd be dead.
[20:30:23] <A-KO> there's no question about it
[20:30:28] <signofzeta> What's a garlic pie, and send me the recipe.
[20:30:37] <vinrock> just a regular pizza with fresh garlic all over it
[20:30:40] <vinrock> instead of garlic powder
[20:30:40] <A-KO> if a common cold fucks me up, I'm pretty sure covid would do some serious damage
[20:30:41] <technonerd> is it vampire friendly?
[20:30:47] <DrZak> Some people are like clouds
[20:30:48] <signofzeta> I'm the only person I know who hasn't gotten COVID.  Masks suck, but they aren't terrible.  They're no worse than underwear.
[20:30:56] <DrZak> when they go away its a beautiful day
[20:30:57] <A-KO> although technically I did test positive for antibodies before vaccines
[20:30:58] <A-KO> so
[20:30:59] <vinrock> i have to have had it
[20:30:59] <A-KO> that's weird
[20:31:10] <vinrock> essential industry, my life basicaly hasnt changed when i tcomes to work
[20:31:31] <A-KO> vinrock: many people say that, but honestly most haven't. I had 3 antibody tests in 2020 , one came back positive
[20:31:47] <A-KO> but that could have been a false positive
[20:31:48] <vinrock> i would just be surprised
[20:31:53] <vinrock> no syptoms, but i neve get sick anyways
[20:32:00] <A-KO> 3 antibody tests, tons of nasal swabs
[20:32:18] <signofzeta> I do IT.  I used to work for a COVID-denier, and now work remotely for a company in California.  I hear from my former colleagues that he finally got COVID, nearly died, and is now trying to balance being pro-vaccine and pro-right-to-infect-others.
[20:32:29] <A-KO> signofzeta: damn
[20:32:36] <vinrock> lol
[20:32:44] <A-KO> well, I"m 1000% pro-vaccine myself. Got my booster couple of weeks ago. Got my flu shot in September.
[20:32:50] <A-KO> I've got an 87 year old grandmother I'm visiting for Christmas
[20:32:51] <A-KO> fuck all that noise
[20:33:08] <signofzeta> I've been asking my doctor for extra vaccines for years.  She wouldn't give me more than I needed, though.
[20:33:30] <A-KO> I've asked my doctor for others. She won't do it. I've been tempted to just go to CVS and get the others
[20:33:33] <A-KO> HPV, Hep, etc.
[20:33:51] <PublicWiFi> ew
[20:33:51] <A-KO> only one I can't take is pertussis

[20:34:05] <DrZak> hpv? it is prolly too late
[20:34:13] <A-KO> DrZak: it's approved up to 40
[20:34:13] <DrZak> hep - shouldnt be a problem
[20:34:15] <signofzeta> and my doctors' organization isn't doing COVID vaccines or testing because it's not profitable enough.  But, she said if anyone gives me grief about getting my third shot, she'll phone in something.
[20:34:31] <A-KO> signofzeta: should be able to schedule walgreens/cvs
[20:34:34] <A-KO> that's what I did
[20:34:38] <DrZak> tethanus is something to be worried about
[20:34:38] <A-KO> I scheduled with walgreens

[20:35:01] <A-KO> :(
[20:35:03] <signofzeta> A-KO: yeah, when I get around to it.  I do WFH so I'm no longer prority, in my opinion.  Plus, I want to try and get a third Moderna.
[20:35:16] <A-KO> signofzeta: that's what I got. 3rd moderna.
[20:35:19] <A-KO> Walgreens is doing them
[20:35:20] <A-KO> easy peasy
[20:35:38] <A-KO> you just check the box that says "I'm at risk" and bam you're good
[20:35:52] <signofzeta> cool!  Thanks!  I might wait until Monday to suffer.
[20:35:52] <A-KO> I know I'm at risk. I'm overweight, asthma, etc.
[20:36:05] <signofzeta> My second shot knocked me out for about six hours.
[20:36:14] <A-KO> My 3rd shot just gave me a gnarly rash for 10 days
[20:36:17] <A-KO> it didn't knock me out
[20:36:19] <signofzeta> I'm overweight and asthmatic too.  maybe I'll do it tomorrow.
[20:36:21] <A-KO> 1 & 2 kicked my ass, 2 was worse
[20:36:31] <Hunterkll> A-KO: SEV A BABYYY 
[20:36:33] <signofzeta> Shot 1 did nothing.  Shot 2 made me almost pass out at work but then I was fine.
[20:36:35] <A-KO> Hunterkll: lol
[20:36:51] <Hunterkll> A-KO: got  JK  on the phone
[20:37:08] <A-KO> shot 2 gave me chills all night long, a fever. It was the weirdest thing being under 3 blankets, having the heat at 80, and still being freezing
[20:37:09] <sd> 10<n​emisys> Is the booster only for moderna or also pfizer?
[20:37:13] <A-KO> all
[20:37:22] <A-KO> pfizer = full booster, moderna = 1/2 booster ; J&J = full booster
[20:37:40] <A-KO> if you got J&J you should get another one, anyone can get it. You can also mix and match if needed.
[20:37:53] <signofzeta> USA: Pfizer boosters are open to everyone 18+.  Moderna boosters are only open to immunocompromised or 65+.  But Moderna's regs are self-satisfying, so you can check the checkbox (I'm told).
[20:38:05] <signofzeta> I'd rather stick with Best Vaccine (Moderna)
[20:38:13] <signofzeta> nothing against the others, mind you
[20:38:54] <signofzeta> I have a friend with a kidney transplant who just got a fourth Moderna.  The vaccines likely do little with her immunosuppressants.
[20:38:56] <A-KO> Pfizer & Moderna boosters are 18+ only if you have underlying health conditions. J&J booster is everyone who got the first shot. Pfizer/Moderna are also open to immunocompromised 18+
[20:39:18] <A-KO> asthma and being a fat ass qualify
[20:39:41] <signofzeta> Well, I have a T-Mobile Tuesday coupon for Little Caesar's.  If that doesn't make me a fat-ass, nothing will.
[20:39:57] <A-KO> either/or btw
[20:40:02] <A-KO> asthma qualifies regardless
[20:40:13] <A-KO> you don't have to be fat *and* have asthma lol
[20:40:24] <signofzeta> even if I don't use an inhaler because I feel like it does nothing?
[20:40:27] <signofzeta> sweet
[20:40:27] <A-KO> yep
[20:40:33] <fritzwastaken> Whyyyyy is the 22nd so far away
[20:40:39] <A-KO> I haven't been back to a pulmonologist since before covid

[20:40:47] <A-KO> so I have no inhaler

[23:31:38] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Unlike other insects that have two pairs of wings, house fly has only one pair of membranous wings. Second pair of wings is reduced and looks like a pair of miniature drumsticks. This pair of wings (known as halters) is used for balancing during the flying process.

[23:53:45] <fritzwastaken> im smokin that bastards
[23:53:59] <vinrock> the turkey's name is Bill
[23:54:01] <rpifan> well they do the whole lamb in morroco
[23:54:03] <rpifan> for their holiday
[23:54:06] <rpifan> and its very expensive
[23:54:08] <fritzwastaken> usually we get a couple breasts and sousvide them, and then grill them
[23:54:20] <vinrock> i watch middle easterners cook that stuff on yt rpifan
[23:54:22] <rpifan> ive not been there but my mom told me about it
[23:54:22] <sintax> my cousin turned me on to sousvide.
[23:54:31] <sintax> holy shit that stuff is amazing. 
[23:54:32] <fritzwastaken> sousvide is so nice
[23:54:38] <vinrock> damn i havent tried sous vide yet
[23:54:45] <fritzwastaken> do a steak to the perfect temp, then just give it a super hard sear
[23:54:48] <sintax> vinrock: it's life changing haha
[23:54:55] <vinrock> i want to get some of those dry aging bags that guga uses
[23:55:11] <fritzwastaken> Theres no color gradiant, its just perfectly mid rare
[23:55:18] <fritzwastaken> with a hard sear on the outside
[23:55:34] <vinrock> i think ive had it before because i have this one steak i got at a place that wasnt anything ritzy, and the steak was fucking flawless from end to end
[23:55:40] <vinrock> the steak was that good ill never forget it
[23:56:03] <fritzwastaken> yea, a lot of grilled mid rare will have a solid gradiant and sometimes an almost raw center
[23:56:13] <fritzwastaken> sousvide is the same color the entire way through and like butter
[23:56:23] <vinrock> i never even tought about that
[23:56:27] <vinrock> i deffo gotta try that shit soon
[23:56:41] <fritzwastaken> with black friday coming up you can prolly get an Anova or something for around 100$
[23:57:11] <vinrock> ill get one i just gotta try to remember
[23:57:11] <fritzwastaken> worth every penny, between that and our Insta pot, thats about 1/2 of the cooking we do
[23:57:29] <vinrock> i been slacking on coking for a few years now and i used to be huge into it
[23:57:38] <vinrock> im gonna try to rekindle the coking in the new year
[23:57:43] <sintax> yeah black friday deals are the real deal for finding a good one marked down
[23:57:58] <fritzwastaken> my wife loves to cook
[23:58:05] <fritzwastaken> and I endorse her the entire way
[23:58:11] <sintax> plus sousvide you set the temp and walk away
[23:58:15] <fritzwastaken> "Sure babe! Whatr do you need?!"
[23:58:29] <fritzwastaken> Our spice rack is fucking stocked
[23:58:33] <mistiry> !flyfact
[23:58:33] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies aren’t really fans of rushing to the hospital to give birth. Their chosen method is rather disgusting as well. House flies will lay their eggs on items such as feces, rotting carcasses, and decaying fruit. Why is this? Well, it’s mainly to provide the larvae (maggots) with something to eat when they hatch.
[23:58:36] <vinrock> i always said id never want to have a relationship because i want anything other than companionship from a woman
[23:58:49] <vinrock> but yeah the lder i get i thnk it would be nice if i had someone cookin
[23:58:50] <vinrock> heh
[23:59:03] <fritzwastaken> and it isnt even lazy cooking, she goes all out
[23:59:08] <fritzwastaken> she loves it
[23:59:17] <vinrock> thats how my house was when i was a little kid
[23:59:19] <fritzwastaken> I buy her the things, I do the dishes and clean the kitchen
[23:59:23] <fritzwastaken> and she goes to town
[23:59:25] <vinrock> my mom cooks like a fuckin beast
[23:59:48] <fritzwastaken> And my family loves her because she cooks most of thanksgiving and xmas dinner
[23:59:50] <vinrock> they always say you think moms cooking is the best but no joke, her food is way better than any fiipino restaurant ive ever been to and other peope have said the same
