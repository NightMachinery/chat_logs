[18:11:23] <DunceCotus> lalia Soul is a very simplified (to the point of being unhelpful) analogy
[18:11:43] <DunceCotus> lalia im talking about levels of consciousness that we don't normally have access to
[18:11:54] <DunceCotus> on a certain level we are all automatons, synthoids
[18:12:09] <DunceCotus> if you get to this level, time and space does weird things
[18:12:47] <DunceCotus> lalia this level also has the most pronounced ego resistances
[18:13:57] <lalia> My take on the "organic machines" models for reasoning leads me to assume the technology we're implying exists is, as yet, completely incomprehensible and as such there's nothing consistently machine-like about organic machines from within the frame of reference we've got presently.
[18:14:07] *** Quits: Shashin_ (Shashin@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/shashin) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[18:14:38] <lalia> That is: I can't wrap my head around thinking of life as machine-like unless we're totally incapable of working with the machinery to any satisfying degree.
[18:14:53] <lalia> So I don't see a reason to adopt the frame of reference.
[18:14:54] <DunceCotus> well its not machines like we think of em
[18:15:04] <DunceCotus> its more 'desiring-machines' which are atemporal and aspatial
[18:15:15] <DunceCotus> asignifying signs connecting up
[18:15:39] <lalia> This perspective limits me to idealizing the body and human consciousness to some degree, which I'm uncomfortable with.
[18:16:04] <DunceCotus> lalia the body and human consciousness are produced by these 'desiring-machines'
[18:16:17] <DunceCotus> however they are immanently producing reality
[18:16:43] <lalia> I'm happy if this sort of take gives you comfort and direction. Gives me anxiety. :D LOL
[18:17:00] <DunceCotus> lalia its extremely anxiety provoking to me too
[18:17:06] <DunceCotus> but its what I experienced
[18:17:23] <DunceCotus> coming to terms with this may take all my life and I may never really be able to
[18:17:59] <DunceCotus> lalia this doesn't even get into how confusing it is to experience this, the time repetition aspect etc. its something I hesitate to even describe to people
[18:18:08] <DunceCotus> because I fear I'd just be causing anxiety
[18:18:35] <lalia> Am a skeptic. I look for means to pursue inquiry without the anxiety of conflict hanging over me. So I don't hang onto perspectives I can't make sense of unless I can do so without stressing out about it. :)
[18:19:09] <DunceCotus> right, at this moment its probably best to not think too hard on it
[18:19:12] <greyrat> (Testing if I can message)
[18:19:15] <lalia> :)
[18:19:17] <DunceCotus> its not something we can understand yet
[18:19:20] <lalia> greyrat: howdy
[18:19:27] <lalia> Welcome.
[18:19:28] <greyrat> lalia Thanks!
[18:19:45] <greyrat> I am setting up ZNC and emacs, and it's quite obtuse
[18:20:25] <lalia> DunceCotus: Interesting standpoint tho. I've heard others with similar takes, so I'm sure you'll find there's more to it when you take more time to develop the thinking.
[18:21:02] <DunceCotus> its related to a kind of relentless consumptive/productive aspect to life
[18:21:35] <alix> is the NPC/zombie thing not a simple matter of self-actualization? when someone isn't self-actualized, then they just walk and talk and act like some kind of caricature of a human being, as if executing commands from a list based on simple algorithms
[18:21:42] <alix> it's not because there's anything wrong with their brain, per se
[18:21:43] <lalia> greyrat: you're in good company. plenty of OG emacs fans around here if you're having trouble. I think there's probably a channel or two dedicated to the software even.
[18:21:57] <alix> it's because they haven't learned to express the uniqueness of their personality, they're not confident enough to do so, they think it's unsafe, etc.
[18:22:06] <alix> go on long enough like that and you do turn into an NPC essentially
[18:22:23] <DunceCotus> alix that's what Gurdgieff called being alseep
[18:22:26] <alix> yes
[18:22:44] <DunceCotus> but even that isn't what im describing
[18:23:11] <DunceCotus> what im describing is a kind of level of consciousness (or unconsciousness rather) in which we're like synthoid avatars
[18:23:24] <lalia> I don't have a lot of experience with Russian philosophers, unfortunately.
[18:24:00] <DunceCotus> I dunno what it would be like to have self-actualization on such a level, but it would be much different to ordinary life
[18:24:00] <lalia> Time for breakfast! BBL.
[18:26:24] <lalia> I'm familiar with Parfit's take on the lack of a unified subject but he doesn't have any commentary on distinguishing between levels of conscisouness from what I remember.
[18:26:31] <DunceCotus> of course such a state may only be accessible in psychedelic experiences (im not even sure death touches this tbh)
[18:26:55] <DunceCotus> Parfit seems a hack
[18:27:10] <lalia> Huh. I'm not going to interface with that.
[18:27:14] <lalia> Do you tho.
[18:27:26] <DunceCotus> im not a fan of analytic philosophy I guess
[18:27:44] <lalia> Fine. I'm very confortable with his work tho. He's anything but a hack.
[18:28:11] <DunceCotus> variety as spice of life
[18:28:45] <lalia> On What Matters is masterfully well concieved and the effort over all three volumes is tremendous.
[18:29:10] <lalia> He even managed to build community effort around many projects he invested in. Lots of great headway in the profession from Parfit's influence.
[18:29:17] <DunceCotus> to be honest ive only had a cursory read of his stuff
[18:29:23] <DunceCotus> but it turned me off continuing
[18:29:27] <lalia> He's greatly missed. :)
[18:29:36] <lalia> I rarely hear an unkind word about the man.
[18:30:39] <DunceCotus> I don't know of any continental philosophers that cite him, but that could be cause they don't usually go in for analytic philosophy
[18:31:27] <lalia> You're saying you're reading examples of continental philosophy from within Parfit's lifetime that you'd expect to see citing his work?
[18:31:29] <lalia> That's...
[18:31:41] <lalia> Very unlikely in any case, right?
[18:32:04] <DunceCotus> I mean theres occasional cross-talk but sure its unlikely
[18:32:42] <lalia> If you're more into Russian philosophers, that's your preference and I'm sure it's fine. :)
[18:32:49] <lalia> I don't understand any Russian. :P
[18:32:52] <lalia> And hate reading translations.
[18:32:55] <DunceCotus> im into philosophers of many nationalities
[18:33:11] <DunceCotus> translations can be problematic sure
[18:35:12] <lalia> Also: it's arguable that the so-called continental/analytic distinction is ultimately a matter of tastes and the difference between them has been gradually collapsing over time.

[18:38:24] <DunceCotus> I mean Badiou I like for some stuff
[18:38:36] <DunceCotus> but his critique of Deleuze misses the mark
[18:38:37] <lalia> I don't like quite a few philosophers (most of the tradition)... but it doesn't effect my perspective on how the disciplines are developing. :D
[18:39:04] <DunceCotus> well that's like your perspective man
[18:39:09] <voltage> "Badiou argues for a return of communism as a political force." omg no!
[18:39:38] <lalia> DunceCotus: sure. :) it's also a fairly typical attitude among professional philosophers.
[18:39:46] <DunceCotus> voltage that's one of Badious least problematic aspects

[18:47:16] <DunceCotus> my problem with 'professional philosophers' is because of their academic status they tend to want to keep such positions
[18:47:35] <DunceCotus> and to keep such positions the system has to be in place, rarely will they criticise the system
[18:47:39] <lalia> Honestly, you should look around and count the number of exceptions among professionals.
[18:47:45] <DunceCotus> or they will do so in a liberal way
[18:47:46] <nihilus> doesn't that apply to everyone?

[21:53:36] <pussipupu> I assume I'd be a terrible emperor, but then I assume the post of emperor is inherently terrible
[21:53:54] <pussipupu> And at least lamp-posts would dispense nourishing gruel
[21:55:07] <MiaMia> pussipupu: where are you come from? The discussion in Germany is not - in any way centered around the means of production
[21:55:33] <pussipupu> UK
[21:56:28] <pussipupu> Though I was in no way meaning to characterise “the left” as a whole
[21:57:42] <MiaMia> yeah i mean the means of production are really important to understand how thinkgs work. it makes sense to educate people about it.
[21:58:07] <MiaMia> what is "the left" for you?
[21:58:25] <pussipupu> And I'm sure there's an awful lot of selection bias in the people I personally talk to and consume
[21:59:05] <pussipupu> Well, I don't think it's a well-defined term and indeed is a pretty dangerous one, but I meant broadly people who would self-identify as such (and to the exclusion of groups like the RCP/spiked cabal)
[21:59:05] <MiaMia> ohhh girl! do not consume nasty humans

[21:59:22] <pussipupu> You're not my line manager
[22:00:08] <MiaMia> :D
[22:00:17] <voltage_> i think the means of production should be in the hands of private owners
[22:01:13] *** Quits: Brumaire (~quassel@81-64-14-121.rev.numericable.fr) (Quit: ran away)
[22:01:23] <MiaMia> i agree! yes private owners which all own a little little tiny bit so all own the means of productions
[22:02:26] <pussipupu> I like coöps and worker-owned businesses as a general rule, though I'm not especially dogmatic about it
[22:03:29] <MiaMia> i think the basic things of live should be state owned like infrastructure, housing and food
[22:03:52] * pussipupu stares blankly at the UK state
[22:03:56] <MiaMia> and health-care
[22:04:09] * pussipupu isn't entirely convinced (although sympathetic in general)
[22:04:38] <MiaMia> all other thinks can be owned by corops
[22:05:06] <MiaMia> i think it is unethical that somewon takes a profit on the life of other
[22:06:14] <MiaMia> pussipupu: yea we have in germany a lot of badly going shit too but it is almost allways because these things need to gernerate profit - like the train or the healtcare system
[22:06:48] <pussipupu> Well, I live in Finland, and I'm much more sympathetic to /that/ government running stuff
[22:07:34] <MiaMia> Finland themes to have a great solution yes!
[22:07:40] <pussipupu> But yeah I agree, the basics should be provided Free at the Point of Delivery by the state
[22:07:41] <pussipupu> (And only partly because FatPoD is a fun initialism)
[22:08:52] <pussipupu> Strong coöp movement here too, my bank is one and so is one of the biggest supermarket chains
[22:08:55] <pussipupu> (slightly weirdly to me I keep finding restaurants owned by the same coöperative as said supermarket)
[22:10:37] <MiaMia> i disagre somewhat about the FatPoD thing. I would much more like a System that creates a seperate economy - a planned economy - for food water and healthcare. Because we have all 20 Years a big Financial Crisis with terible looses. 2008 died 500000 People with cancer because the Finacial Crysis destroyed things.
[22:11:56] <MiaMia> The Idea: You make the basic things so robust and seperate from capitalism so that capitalism can realy go crasy without killing people if it goas wrong
[22:13:25] <pussipupu> Fair enough but I'd say that was an engineering disagreement rather than an ethical one
[22:14:01] <pussipupu> And I'm extremely open to planned solutions for basics like food, transport, education, access to manufacturies, that sort of stuff
[22:14:27] <MiaMia> Well if you ignore the dead people yes. With dead people a System that you can not forcast is a bit unethical.
[22:14:33] <voltage_> MiaMia, what if you plan wrong and you produce too little food and people starve to death
[22:15:00] <MiaMia> You mean like in the USA while the financial crysis?
[22:15:24] <pussipupu> They didn't produce too little food, they failed to distribute it
[22:15:46] <MiaMia> Good point.
[22:16:37] <MiaMia> I think food production is a pretty good thing for planed production.
[22:16:54] <pussipupu> And indeed the same can be said of our global meta-civilisation on a number of basics, not just food
[22:17:06] <voltage_> what if everything was planned and nobody innovated anything
[22:17:16] <voltage_> and central government planned your meals
[22:17:34] <voltage_> and you'd eat just one and the same meal every day for years
[22:18:04] <MiaMia> The UDSSR has - as a example - a better diet for its people then the USA - at least in the later UDSSR
[22:18:45] <MiaMia> voltage_: inovation is a good point - allmost all big technologies are paid by the goverment...
[22:19:27] <MiaMia> voltage_: yes in a planned economy patatos would be the only food
[22:19:34] <pussipupu> Planned food production for the necessary I'm open to but want more data on, but also empowerment in the form of things like allotments and community farms for small-scale democratic production
[22:20:02] <voltage_> MiaMia, provide a citation for that pls
[22:20:15] <voltage_> im gonna take a page out of [itchyjunk]'s book

[23:02:26] <[itchyjunk]> MiaMia, production, distribution, logistics type of topics are super interesing i think
[23:03:13] <nalkri> ##politics is pretty inimical to actual conversation, and political philosophy isn't particularly irrelevant to philosophy
[23:03:20] <MiaMia> it is, but i have to say that i am not interessted in these types of discussions since in the era of computers everything is difrent.
[23:04:00] <MiaMia> and histroical data is not sufficient to count this in
[23:05:13] <audrey> I do not recommend ##politics to anyone.
