[16:50:19] <AntoineFontaine[> test
[16:50:28] <afontain[m]> it's much, much easier when you've got an admin on the other side ^^'
[16:51:44] <afontain[m]> well, to workaround that, you'd need the appservice be not an admin
[16:53:56] <afontain[m]> except admin means the highest permission level (100) and only someone with higher permissions can demote someone

[16:55:59] <Jonas[t][m]> can we re-invite people who have been kicked on the telegram side?
[16:58:22] <Jonas[t][m]> looks like I can only invite people which have got me in their contact list, so I can't...
[17:00:17] <AntoineFontaine[> I can't add Fotis back
[17:08:31] <MisterMerlinGran> if there's an invite link can't you just dm that to the people you can't add?
[17:11:26] <jonas[m]> !tg invite-link
[17:12:14] <Jonas[t][m]> this'd be the invite link: https://t.me/joinchat/8wkj92SOdzFmZDRk
