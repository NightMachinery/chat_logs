[03:30:10] <pavonia> There's `title:first-of-type`, but that will only find the first <title> relative to it's parent container
[03:30:41] <pavonia> So you probably need to narrow the selector down a bit by adding more context

[04:37:15] <FunkyBob> ahaha... wow... so...

[05:41:56] <FunkyBob> well, first things first... I think separating the image and caption makes little sense
[05:42:29] <FunkyBob> also as mentioned before, I'd likely do the image+floppy framing quite differently, so the img src was the actual image
[05:42:31] <jargon> The only glitch it the caption font being too big when vw is greater than 900px and the 3rd row caption not lining up with its icon.

[18:06:59] <no_gravity> Hello! Any good CSS modal windows out there?
[18:07:18] <hmw[at]> <div> :)
[18:08:46] <hmw[at]> no_gravity: I'd say, roll your own, no need for a large library. Perhaps this simple example helps: https://harald.ist.org/paste/modal_prompt_fading.html
[18:09:58] <hmw[at]> Huh. How did I mess up the indentation that badly?
[18:10:49] <no_gravity> hmw[at]: Well, I am writing one now. Its a bit crazy because there are probably tons of edge cases to covert.
[18:11:32] <no_gravity> cover
[18:11:44] <hmw[at]> My example does not actively block the background. You'd have to add a div behind the modal, but above everything else, to "catch" any clicks, while the modal is blocking. I am working on repairing the indentation now.
[18:12:04] <hmw[at]> In my experience, it isn't a very complicated thing, done it often before.
[18:14:59] <hmw[at]> Updated.
[18:15:48] <no_gravity> hmw[at]: The editor on that page takes up all the space.
[18:15:56] <no_gravity> hmw[at]: Leaves no space for the preview.
[18:16:09] <hmw[at]> Click Autohide and focus the main area
[18:16:36] <no_gravity> Hmm.. Autohide does not do anything.
[18:16:50] <no_gravity> Hmmm.. now it does.
[18:16:51] <hmw[at]> Wiggle the mouse, or wait. I can move the thing to the left

[18:17:16] <no_gravity> Did you code this pastebin?
[18:17:40] <hmw[at]> yes. It's not a real paste bin, as I have to manually create the files, it only formats the source code.
[18:18:20] <hmw[at]> Some ugly .htaccess trickery with super ugly JS :)
[18:18:22] <no_gravity> I wonder if this really is a modal? It seems to be just a centered div?
[18:18:44] <hmw[at]> It isn't really modal. What's missing is that it should prevent the background from being clicked.
[18:19:10] <no_gravity> Yes.
[18:19:19] <no_gravity> This is my current approach:
[18:19:25] <no_gravity> https://jsfiddle.net/8y12kLze/
[18:19:31] <hmw[at]> I usually insert a second div to do that. That second div is full screen size but transparent (or even a blur effect)

[18:19:59] <hmw[at]> My code at least shows you the trickery with the multiple timeouts needed for the transition to work
[18:20:10] <no_gravity> I don't need transition.
[18:20:42] <hmw[at]> Ah, that makes it a bit simpler

[18:41:37] <no_gravity> My modal library is functional :) https://jsfiddle.net/8y12kLze/2/
[18:43:11] <hmw[at]> no_gravity: I'd advise against assigning HTML like this. It is processing the full page, turning it back to HTML, replacing, re-parsing. You should use document.createElement instead.
[18:43:40] <no_gravity> hmw[at]: Not sure what you mean.
[18:44:12] <hmw[at]> Your code turns the DOM contents into HTML, then replaces the modal content in that string, and re-creates new HTML from that. That is very expensive.
[18:44:48] <hmw[at]> ah
[18:44:49] <hmw[at]> ok
[18:44:55] <hmw[at]> it doesn'T do the DOM thing, I claimed.
[18:45:07] <hmw[at]> Still not exactly efficient.
[18:45:26] <no_gravity> "turns the dom contents into html"? Which line would do that?
[18:46:26] <hmw[at]> it doesn'T do the DOM thing, I claimed.
[18:46:40] <no_gravity> Yeah
[18:46:40] <hmw[at]> I got something confused. You have the string from the get go
[18:48:02] <hmw[at]> Well. It will work :)
[18:48:35] <hmw[at]> Normally, I'd stuff a new <style> into head when the "library" is loaded
[18:48:50] <hmw[at]> and only add/remove the div
[18:49:29] <hmw[at]> Still. I want to get rid of the wrapper and use ::before. I think it should be doable.
[18:49:46] <no_gravity> The library will be loaded on hundreds of millions of pageviews without ever showing the modal.
[18:50:05] <no_gravity> Because it will be loaded on every pageview but the modal will only be displayed on the users first pageview.
[18:50:20] <no_gravity> So I don't want to inject something into hundreds of millions of heads for no reason :)

[19:02:33] <no_gravity> Try in a small window.
[19:02:38] <hmw[at]> overflow:auto perhaps
[19:03:10] <no_gravity> I think that would only work with an absolute height of the <p> element.

[19:03:49] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/35bdzjqs/
[19:04:29] <hmw[at]> I should not be allowed to scroll the main page though, while the modal is visible. Hmm.
[19:04:32] <no_gravity> Oh, "overflow: auto" on the modal. Yeah, that might work.
[19:05:39] <hmw[at]> Oh, I didn't notice the overflow on the p
[19:05:49] <hmw[at]> That can go
[19:05:55] <no_gravity> Yes
[19:06:48] <no_gravity> I wonder how hard it would be to prevent the background from scrolling.
[19:06:57] <hmw[at]> Why is the mouse wheel going through to body though? I don't understand that.
[19:07:17] <hmw[at]> You could add a temporary class to body, I guess.
[19:07:29] <no_gravity> hmw[at]: What class?
[19:07:50] <hmw[at]> perhaps making it oferflow:hidden; but that's not ideal either, because the scrollbar would disappear
[19:08:30] <hmw[at]> You could catch the mousewheel event and make it ignore the scroll

[22:30:53] <hmw[at]> scara: Assign what ever you need to all LIs first, then overwrite (remove the settings) with :first-child
[22:31:37] <scara> Is there another way? I need to do this via javascript.
[22:31:53] <hmw[at]> You asked in #css for a CSS solution :)
[22:32:11] <bin> li:not(:first-child)
[22:32:16] <hmw[at]> There is no inverse :first-child in CSS afaik
[22:32:21] <hmw[at]> oh
[22:32:25] <hmw[at]> kay

[23:12:44] <hmw[at]> oh, also nice
[23:12:54] <scara> hunboy: What is this?
[23:13:07] <hmw[at]> an alternative solution to the question you asked
[23:13:15] <hunboy> :)
[23:13:23] <scara> Why didn't you just send me a .js file?
[23:13:53] <hunboy> because its css channel :P
[23:13:56] <hmw[at]> `live
[23:13:56] <Selvvir> hmw[at], Please provide a live page or a working demonstration of your problem to make it possible to debug. If it's local or private, copy your HTML and CSS into a `testcase in a `paste server like http://jsfiddle.net or http://codepen.io. Screenshots and plain text code pastes are difficult to debug.

[23:14:14] <scara> it says jsfiddle I thought it was js.
[23:14:27] <hmw[at]> scara: We usually don't even look at pure code pastes, so it is a habit to use a fiddle like thingy.
[23:14:32] <scara> "live"
[23:14:55] <hmw[at]> you just got a "live" answer, so to say :)
[23:15:02] <scara> When does it update?
[23:15:09] <hmw[at]> when "save" is clicked
[23:15:24] <hmw[at]> if you want to edit and see changes, focus one of the source code fields and press Ctrl+Return
[23:16:18] <scara> Thought the logic is a bit weird, n+2 looks good.
[23:16:51] <scara> 2-n would be better as it would look like a list.
[23:17:03] <hmw[at]> heheh
[23:18:14] <hmw[at]> That'd be "2 minus n" though.
[23:18:48] *** Quits: fweht (uid404746@id-404746.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[23:19:24] <scara> No, when you say 5-10 everyone knows you mean 5 thru 10 so if you mentaly subsitute "n" with the number of items in the list it makes more sense.
[23:21:10] <hmw[at]> But we don't speak CSS, we code in it. There is other things, like nth-child(2n) for example, which also uses a math expression to declare which indices are affected
[23:22:09] <hmw[at]> (2n+1 would be the other half of the set)

[23:44:46] <scara> CSS sounds complex, wouldn't be suprised if one day it caused a security vulnerability.
[23:49:12] <FunkyBob> already happened, I believe
[23:49:20] <FunkyBob> someone managed a key logger with it, iirc
[23:55:35] <hmw[at]> wow, I'd be curious to see that
[23:55:54] <hmw[at]> CSS is almost turing complete though (It only needs a human to continually clicking a spot)
[23:56:13] <hassoon_> css vs security ?
[23:56:18] <hassoon_> lel what ?
[23:57:01] <hmw[at]> "owser. The impact of  this type of vulnerability varies based on the supplied CSS payload. It  may lead to cross site scripting or data exfiltration"
