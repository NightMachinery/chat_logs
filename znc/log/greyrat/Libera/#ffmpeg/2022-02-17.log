[00:16:14] <JEEB> Manouchehri: btw you should avoid utilizing the npp scale filter, instead the cuda scale filter (which can actually be distributed) should now be able to do all the jobs of it
[00:16:30] <JEEB> and you can tell by the hwaccel_output_format and by the filter chain working
[00:16:46] <JEEB> since the filter chain will not do a hwdownload to normal RAM by itself
[00:17:16] <JEEB> also I think the output logging should show the pixel format as cuda

[00:20:29] <JEEB> yes, because probing is only done with a sw decoder
[00:20:54] <JEEB> basically with hwaccel_output_format you are telling FFmpeg to output as those hwaccel buffers
[00:20:59] <JEEB> not normal memory buffers

[00:21:12] <JEEB> and scale_cuda by itself cannot convert from to another anyways
[00:21:23] <JEEB> if you try to leave the hwaccel_output_format out, it should just  error out
[00:21:38] <JEEB> since there is no integrated logic to make the filter chain work between hwaccel formats and normal formats
[00:21:39] <Manouchehri> When should I use hevc_cuvid?
[00:21:41] <JEEB> :P
[00:21:44] <JEEB> never
[00:21:52] <Manouchehri> why? :)
[00:22:06] <Manouchehri> I believe you, I just didn't like the answer I saw online (which didn't give any reason lol(
[00:22:07] <JEEB> it just leaves parsing to nvidia's drivers, which means that if they have a bug you cannot get it fixed
[00:22:13] <Manouchehri> ahhhh
[00:22:20] <JEEB> cuvid is basically parser + decoder more or less
[00:22:31] <JEEB> while hwaccel is the base H.264/HEVC etc parsing/decoding
[00:22:41] <JEEB> but then slice decoding is left to nvidia/whatever
[00:22:42] <Manouchehri> so we're using only CUDA for decoding and encoding?
[00:23:08] <JEEB> well, nvidia's libraries
[00:23:18] <JEEB> it's not like you are going to be parsing GPU buffers
[00:23:50] <JEEB> but yea, using hwaccel means you can affect something :P
[00:24:02] <JEEB> since the base format parsing etc metadata reading is done in FFmpeg
[00:24:32] <JEEB> while with the "full decoder" a la cuvid, you are just passing the buffers to nvidia's driver and hoping for the best
[00:24:55] <JEEB> I probably am not 100% technically correct, but hopefully close enough :P
[00:25:54] <JEEB> there recently was a good example of why it's good to do stuff on your side, when nvidia's driver stuff just crashed if you fed the encoder API certain metadata
[00:26:05] <JEEB> and that could not be fixed on FFmpeg's side :P

[00:38:25] <JEEB> then you don't care whether it is nv12 or yuv420p
[00:38:38] <JEEB> nv12 being half-packed and yuv420p being fully planar
[00:38:49] <JEEB> I guess you're saying this since your input is 10bit 4:2:0?

[01:02:08] <JEEB> have static libraries?
[01:02:21] <JEEB> either build yourself or poke at Btbn's automatic builds or so
[01:02:46] <JEEB> it's not a real problem, you're just not having the build configuration that you seem to wish for
[01:03:36] <Polochon_street> I've tried to get the four last here https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases, but the non-shared version just has the ffmpeg exe
[01:03:59] <Polochon_street> and the -shared seems to has been built with `--enable-shared`, which is not what I want I guess right?

[01:06:59] <Polochon_street> oh, the original BtbN haha, hi
[01:07:02] <JEEB> just put the DLLs next to the exe first?
[01:07:12] <Polochon_street> yeah, this works

[01:07:45] <Polochon_street> I've been procrastinating this for too long, and now it's the last thing I *have* to do :(
[01:08:27] <JEEB> I mean if you do not know how to build FFmpeg itself, then just utilize BtbN's build framework, fork it and package the static libraries as well?
[01:08:36] <Polochon_street> I gueeess my option is to cross-compile ffmpeg, with `--enable-static` and `--disable-shared`
[01:08:43] <JEEB> after all, his build automation is all public
[01:08:55] <JEEB> that's the default configuration FYI
[01:09:00] <BtbN> JEEB, you can't. The static libraries will depend on the literal mountain of other static libs that are burried in the docker image.
[01:09:09] <JEEB> ah
[01:09:11] <furq> if you don't need external libraries then cross compiling is easy
[01:09:19] <JEEB> and yes
[01:09:21] <furq> the annoying bit is cross compiling all of those
[01:09:34] <BtbN> If I included all the static libs in the static released, they'd be like 500MB each

[01:10:07] <Polochon_street> it's nice to have the explanation as to why it's not working as I thought it would, thanks guys :
[01:10:09] <BtbN> You can grab the docker images, and build ffmpeg and your stuff in them
[01:10:09] <JEEB> I know my use cases and since 95+% of all decoders are included within
[01:10:10] <Polochon_street> :)*
[01:10:12] <BtbN> they got all the stuff needed
[01:10:52] <JEEB> that is kind of what I hinted at by making use of your public build automation
[01:10:55] <furq> based on the github readme you probably don't need any external libraries
[01:11:06] <furq> but maybe song analysis requires libx264 nowadays

[01:11:22] <JEEB> yea if the use case is something like that
[01:11:31] <JEEB> then a general LGPL build I'd bet even should be OK?

[03:30:05] <Manouchehri> for nearly lossless hevc, how sane does this look?

[03:31:21] <BtbN> looks stupidly over-tunes to me
[03:31:29] <BtbN> *tuned
[03:32:17] <BtbN> set preset and tune, and then play with the cq value until you like the result, the end
[03:32:48] <BtbN> And with udu_sei enabled, you still have a very high chance of your encode exploding the moment they actually exist
[03:33:58] <Manouchehri> ffmpeg -hide_banner -y -hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda -stream_loop -1 -i /mnt/ssd/1.mp4 -vf "scale_cuda=w=2560:h=1440:format=p010le" -c:a copy -c:v hevc_nvenc -preset p7 -profile:v main10 -tier high -tune:v hq -rc:v vbr -cq:v 0 -b:v 0 -movflags frag_keyframe+empty_moov -tag:v hvc1 -f mp4 /dev/null # so this instead?
[03:34:51] <BtbN> Why are you turning off b-frames?
[03:34:58] <BtbN> and you don't need to explicitly set vbr
[03:35:25] <BtbN> And unless you want to scale up/down, you can completely drop that filter.
[03:35:27] <Manouchehri> is vbr the default?
[03:35:31] <Manouchehri> yeah I'm scaling

[04:37:59] <Manouchehri> 4:00:56 PM <JEEB> not that I can see right away. there's a vulkan one, and IIRC there was some sort of cuda<->vulkan interoperability. not sure how well it works, though
[04:37:59] <Manouchehri> what's the vulkan filter called?
[04:41:06] <BtbN> That issue comment is simply wrong about all of its claims, Manouchehri
[04:41:14] <BtbN> qmin/qmax default to -1 for nvenc
[04:41:26] <Manouchehri> oh lol
[04:41:43] <BtbN> and if you set -cq, the value of -b is ignored and even avtively overwritten to 0
[04:41:49] <BtbN> only rc_max_rate is still honored

[07:47:44] <aphysically> huh dashjs doesn't like the mp3 I tried; I had to use audiotag mp4a which worked for mpv/streamlink opening the dash stream, but dashjs says it's invalid
[07:48:02] <furq> browsers generally don't like mp3 in mp4
[07:48:10] <furq> mp3 sure mp4 sure both? no way
[07:48:15] <aphysically> ah
[07:48:19] <aphysically> I won't worry about it then
[07:48:49] <aphysically> I only wanted to make it work with mp3 for completeness so if I had a source I could just copy it over
[07:49:07] <aphysically> which almost never happens so whatever
[07:50:24] <aphysically> I guess the webm would work then, but not sure if dashenc's hls playlist works with it......and I'm not sure if I would have to touch all the audio tags again :P

[10:46:27] <zetaE> is anybody aware of this?? NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK
[10:46:55] <zetaE> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NVIDIA-Image-Scaling-SDK-1.0.2
[10:46:57] <JEEB> Aurora_v_kosmose: looking at the avformat header's doxy comments, nb_chapters and chapters seems where you have an allocated array of AVChapters
[10:48:11] <zetaE> another weird question, is there a linux stand alone player like youtubes with video sections titles and all that?
[10:48:41] <JEEB> zetaE: yea I took a brief look into it and linked it on libplacebo's side. it's nice that they also released something under MIT, but I think it was relatively standard scaling primitives. so using a normal scaler through libplacebo or something should yield similar results. my understanding can be partial/incorrect, o' course.
[10:48:49] <JEEB> just like the similar AMD thing
[10:50:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh I see. Each AVChapter has an inset AVDictionary.
[10:51:35] <zetaE> JEEB: does the SDK use the GPU to do it?
[10:51:58] <zetaE> JEEB: does libeplaceb use any type of GPU acceleration to carry out the scaling?
[10:52:17] <JEEB> that's the idea of libplacebo :P
[10:52:57] <zetaE> if they release a scaling with their nvidia branding it ought to have a selling point
[10:53:20] <JEEB> well they got the main benefit already
[10:53:24] <JEEB> just like AMD did
[10:53:35] <JEEB> "omg they released something under their name as open source"
[10:53:36] <haasn> I don't actually remember looking into this
[10:53:38] <haasn> possibly I did and forgot about it
[10:53:51] <JEEB> it was the GLSL/HLSL thing that I linked yesterday
[10:54:06] <JEEB> and you were weirded out how it did half-float data types
[10:54:07] <haasn> somebody did very recently port a bunch of AMD shaders to GLSL though
[10:54:10] <haasn> oh
[10:54:12] <haasn> I see
[10:54:29] <JEEB> > surprised it's 'float16_t' and 'f16vec2' instead of 'half' and 'hvec2'
[10:54:32] <haasn> how GLSL did, rather
[10:54:32] <JEEB> so you did at least look at it :D
[10:54:41] <haasn> I only looked at the #define sea since that's what you commented on :p
[10:54:47] <JEEB> :)
[10:55:00] <JEEB> yea, it was an interesting take at making it work with both HLSL and GLSL

[17:04:53] <haasn> use webm?
[17:06:54] <LunaLovegood> When trying to split a MPTS (multiple program transport stream), I get "Non-monotonous DTS in output stream ..." warnings all the time. That's caused by each program running on its own clock (PCR/DTS/PTS/etc). Is there a way to have ffmpeg tolerate a different clock for each output file/socket? Example command that causes issue:
[17:06:59] <LunaLovegood> ffmpeg -i in.ts -map 0:p:1 -c copy -f mpegts out1.ts -map 0:p:2 -c copy -f mpegts out2.ts
[17:07:23] <LunaLovegood> Where program 1 and program 2's have different PCRs.
[17:08:47] <LunaLovegood> Note that extracting only out1.ts or only out2.ts solves the issue, but I'd want to split a 15 programs TS stream in a single ffmpeg instance if possible. (ZMQ/tcp inputs and outputs)
[17:10:00] <LunaLovegood> Also, the warnings are not harmless, ffmpeg tries to "fix" the DTS values, which messes up the outputs.

[18:36:18] <bencoh> dvblast/multicat are definitely great tools for that kind of things :)

[22:18:14] <kepstin> the codec would have been vp9. You can re-encode that file with ffmpeg preserving the alpha channel, but to do so you need to manually select the libvpx-vp9 decoder
[22:18:21] *** Joins: microchip_ (~neutrino@user/microchip/x-0766185)
[22:18:45] <kepstin> (which you do by putting "-c:v libvpx-vp9" before the -i option that specifies the input file)
[22:20:58] <chazy> that makes sense
[22:21:00] <chazy> one last thing, in windows what do i use instead of &&? it's giving me an error
[22:21:15] <chazy> or do i not need 2 passes? sorry i'm not an expert at this
[22:21:23] <kepstin> you could just run 2 commands separately

[22:21:46] <kepstin> 2-pass encoding is recommended with libvpx since its 1 pass rate control isn't very good
[22:22:57] <chazy> how do i do that then? do i have to replace something from the command?
[22:23:04] <chazy> c:\ffmpeg c:vlibvpx-vp9 -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 30 -vf "scale=640:-1" -pass 1 -an -f null NULl && \
[22:23:20] <kepstin> the "&&" is just use to run one command first then the other
[22:23:31] <kepstin> so you can run the part before &&, then run the part after the &*&
[22:23:36] <chazy> oh ok
[22:24:38] <furq> && works just fine in cmd
[22:24:45] <furq> it'll be the backslash/newline that it doesn't like
[22:26:33] <lbvotkin> I'm transcoding some PCM audio to aac in c++ and i'm getting `2 frames left in the queue on closing` . I'm calling the modern `api ie avcodec_send_frame()`  then `avcodec_receive_packet()` then `av_write_frame()` . Is there a flush command or something that I should be calling on shutdown or should I just not care about the last 2 frames?
[22:27:23] <kepstin> to flush the encoder, you call send_frame() with NULL, then receive_packet until it stops returning packets.
[22:27:58] <lbvotkin> brilliant -- thanks a lot!
