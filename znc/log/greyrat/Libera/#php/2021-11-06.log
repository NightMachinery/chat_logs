[01:53:39] <judabuda> im having problem with nginx and php. when i go to localhost/whatever.php and prompts me to download file, but i want it to run.
[01:54:22] <judabuda> this is the right channel right for that?
[01:54:56] <da_wunder> so first share your nginx configuration - seems like it doesn't have handler for php files

[01:58:57] <da_wunder> most likely you're not running php-fpm on that nginx context - right?
[02:01:14] <judah> Check your nginx log file. 'tail -f /var/log/nginx/*.log' run that in your terminal then hit the page again

[02:25:33] <judabuda> Blondie101010: it says it's "root"
[02:26:08] <Blondie101010> that sounds wrong, so why did you say "yes"?
[02:26:23] <judabuda> what
[02:26:27] <Blondie101010> hold on
[02:26:37] <judabuda> i said yes because i know owner is "root"

[02:37:25] <Blondie101010> what ??
[02:37:40] <Blondie101010> are you still getting prompted to download or run?
[02:38:02] <judabuda> i want nginx to run php file in browser "localhost/whatever.php" but when i enter that in browser, it prompts me to download the file, but i don't want to download it
[02:38:12] <judabuda> i want the file to run and give something on the webpage
[02:38:18] <Blondie101010> ok so lets consider this the base test
[02:38:20] <judabuda> ><Blondie101010> are you still getting prompted to download or run?
[02:38:20] <judabuda> yes
[02:38:23] <Albright> That's an nginx question, not a PHP one
[02:38:34] <Blondie101010> can you validate that that test does not add a new error in the nginx log?

[02:41:55] <Blondie101010> ok so that part is good
[02:42:04] <Blondie101010> do you have fpm installed?
[02:42:20] <judabuda> no
[02:42:34] <Blondie101010> the error in your log is probably related to the default index file which might not even exist

[06:21:34] <Blondie101010> Gamara:  if you didn't lie in the interview or on your CV, the employer should be able to prepare you
[06:21:41] <Gamara> I didn
[06:21:52] <BadAdviceCat> (That was fast! xD)
[06:21:53] <Gamara> oops, I didn't lie I made a project in PHP and won a hackathon
[06:21:57] <Blondie101010> spend time on what you actually encounter
[06:22:10] <Blondie101010> that is my suggestion
[06:22:50] <Gamara> I more want to learn how to write cleaner and more efficient php code etc
[06:23:18] <Blondie101010> you'll need to adapt to the methods of the new work environment
[06:23:26] <Blondie101010> don't start learning something different now
[06:25:52] <Gamara> Its not that I want to learn something different, I just want to have a better understanding of the PHP langauge I guess I should just read the official docs
[06:26:01] <BadAdviceCat> Gamara, what you're saying is vague. Cleaner code is subjective (Is this clean? Is this script filled with a lot of fluff? Is it pretty? Is it overkill/too big?? - People really do concern themselves with these things that are trivial imo)  - About efficient PHP code, that is too broad to learn about "all in one fell swoop".
[06:26:07] <Blondie101010> whendo you start?
[06:26:18] <Gamara> 3 weeks
[06:26:22] <Gamara> I coded this and it got me the job
[06:26:23] <Gamara> https://github.com/istareatscreens/TTT_TG
[06:26:43] <Gamara> Yeah I guess I am being vague you are right
[06:27:22] <BadAdviceCat> To summarize... You will basically end up knowing a lot of things that will not make any sense without the context. Context is important. You will get or have this "context" when you encounter a problem (i.e.  spend time on what you actually encounter)
[06:28:41] <Blondie101010> Gamara:  I'm looking at your code...  it doesn't look bad at all, but I'd suggest you use parameter typehinting
[06:28:58] <Gamara> I am more or less just asking for good books or resources to become a better PHP developer since I kind of learned PHP from like a 3 hour video on youtube and through just coding in it and googling stuff.
[06:29:32] <Blondie101010> no one does a bachelor's degree in PHP
[06:29:41] *** Quits: fkrauthan (~fkrauthan@user/fkrauthan) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[06:30:28] <Gamara> I was considering just reading through the offical documentation, but was just asking if that would be wise or if there are other resources you could recommend, and thanks for the type hinting suggestion, I will definitely look that up sounds really cool
[06:30:36] *** Joins: fkrauthan (~fkrauthan@user/fkrauthan)
[06:32:04] <Gamara> BadAdviceCat I guess that makes total  sense because PHP seems like a langauge built with a lot of utility for specific scenarios
[06:32:36] <Blondie101010> you're already type hinting return values
[06:32:59] <Blondie101010> ah I just saw a few function parameter hints
[06:33:28] <Blondie101010> this interaction gives me a strange impression, as if you didn't write that code
[06:33:43] <Gamara> I did write the code though I just wrote it over 2 months a lot of time half asleep
[06:33:50] <Gamara> write*
[06:34:04] <Blondie101010> hmm ok
[06:34:10] <Blondie101010> like I said it looks good
[06:36:17] <Gamara> What about this interaction makes you feel that way? I just have imposter syndrome I think and that is making me scared.
[06:36:51] <Gamara> I have a lot of stuff in my repo if you looked at it you would see my interative improvement
[06:36:58] <Gamara> iterative*
[06:37:20] <Gamara> sorry gradual *
[06:37:53] <Gamara> I am just asking for resources to study PHP I dont think that is an unreasonable thing to ask in a PHP channel
[06:38:59] <Gamara> also I wanted to thank you guys because you helped me write the project with your help :)

[06:45:22] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[06:47:09] <BadAdviceCat> Gamara, as far as clean code is concerned, it would at least be good to be aware of more design principles if you aren't already aware of it: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/ae7e7c0468434c2b884ab6159ffbffa8
[06:48:15] <Gamara> Oh this is awesome, I know some of these but some I have never seen before thank you so much :D
[06:50:29] <BadAdviceCat> So even if you think you already know the terminologies, it's good to learn it from another person's perspective. This is generally why I prefer to learn from multiple sources, rather than just 1 place/1 website/1 person.
[06:51:24] <BadAdviceCat> It helps me eliminate some falsehoods, or at least understand the context for "Why are things the way it is"
[06:51:25] <Gamara> Yeah, that is how I prefer to learn as well read a textbook, watch videos, and practice
[06:52:39] <Gamara> that is really good advice I appreciate it BadAdviceCat :)
[06:55:20] <BadAdviceCat> https://www.google.com/search?q=php%2C+hexagonal+architecture is another one.
[06:56:44] <Gamara> Awesome :D thank you so much all of this stuff seems really cool

[20:50:41] <BadAdviceCat> gizmore, there is not 1 third party php script/lib that you like?
[20:51:42] <gizmore> BadAdviceCat: i use htmlpurifier

[20:52:53] <gizmore> phpunit?

[20:56:32] <BadAdviceCat> Gotcha.
[20:57:05] <gizmore> Laravel got some things better
[20:57:09] <gizmore> some things worse
[20:57:17] <gizmore> gdo6 is not that bad
[21:00:44] <BadAdviceCat> gizmore, nifty. Does your website by any chance use 2FA?
[21:04:58] *** Joins: g0zart (~g0zart@gateway/vpn/pia/g0zart)
[21:05:06] <gizmore> BadAdviceCat: i can write a module
[21:05:11] <gizmore> sms?
[21:05:24] <BadAdviceCat> Eww, no sms. >.<
[21:06:04] <gizmore> googlecode?
[21:06:11] <BadAdviceCat> gizmore, here, try this: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/f46dbcffd5164ad2a9f53f41a8321452
[21:06:29] <BadAdviceCat> Webauthn. :D
[21:06:40] <gizmore> autne
[21:06:56] <gizmore> now we all login as 'ruth'
[21:07:07] * gizmore BadAdviceCat typing: "ruth"
[21:07:12] <gizmore> *root
[21:07:15] <gizmore> one of them is root
[21:07:49] <BadAdviceCat> This is what I plan to use if I ever end up with a website.
[21:07:58] <gizmore> interesting
[21:08:15] <gizmore> 2FA indeed is a nice aspect of a framework
[21:08:21] <gizmore> let me check laravel
[21:08:48] <gizmore> https://github.com/asbiin/laravel-webauthn
[21:09:03] <gizmore> the evil force is heading their troups
[21:09:08] <gizmore> i need a module too
[21:09:22] <BadAdviceCat> Yup. There you go :D
[21:09:34] <gizmore> gdo user concept is fun too
[21:09:44] <gizmore> there is ghost,guest,member
[21:09:48] <gizmore> and system
[21:09:57] <gizmore> ghost is no cookie at all
[21:10:04] <gizmore> guest is chosen guestname
[21:10:09] <gizmore> member is a regular user
[21:10:12] <BadAdviceCat> Got it.
[21:10:23] <gizmore> and system got uid1
[21:10:34] <gizmore> special group, no special permissions
[21:10:46] <gizmore> useless cracker target
[21:10:48] <BadAdviceCat> If you ever end up setting up webauthn, do share us your success story :D
[21:10:53] <gizmore> :D
[21:11:01] <gizmore> .+quote <BadAdviceCat> If you ever end up setting up webauthn, do share us your success story :D
[21:12:00] <BadAdviceCat> I wish Twitch.tv uses webauthn.
[21:13:18] <gizmore> they rely on bootstrap6?

[21:15:05] <BadAdviceCat> I do not know. Probably.
[21:15:18] <gizmore> where is bootstrap from? twitter?
[21:15:33] <gizmore> fun fact: gdo6 does not really feature bootstrap3
[21:15:40] <gizmore> it was a todo once
[21:15:47] <BadAdviceCat> I'm talking about the streaming service. https://www.twitch.tv/
[21:16:32] <gizmore> yea
[21:16:59] <gizmore> i am talking about bootstrape
[21:17:30] <BadAdviceCat> Twitter made bootstrap. It's nice they finally got rid of jquery.

[22:07:37] <SpeakSpanishBoy> In a docker image of php-apache, How to config php.ini from docker-yml file? I always edit php.ini from /etc/php/.../apache2
[22:28:15] *** Quits: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Quit: Quitting)
[22:32:31] <biberu> SpeakSpanishBoy: i don't know the correct path for that image, but you can e.g. make a new image with it as base if you want to include your configuration in the image, or use a volume mount to shadow it if you want to be able to edit and reload without rebuilding
[22:36:44] <SpeakSpanishBoy> I want edit with docker-compose's file because It's easy to share I will try it
[22:36:56] <biberu> https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes
[22:37:03] <biberu> SpeakSpanishBoy ^
[22:38:04] <SpeakSpanishBoy> I'm gonna check it
[22:39:50] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:40:34] <biberu> SpeakSpanishBoy: so e.g. volumes: // - php.ini:/config/path/in/container/php.ini // ...
[22:43:47] <biberu> SpeakSpanishBoy: if you want to extract the configuration from the base image `docker cp` is an easy way
[22:44:01] <biberu> (if you want it as a template)
[22:45:25] <SpeakSpanishBoy> I want put config values in yaml file :S
[22:47:18] <biberu> you could do that, but you'd probably need to write your own entry point that takes those values and updates the config files in the container
[22:48:20] <biberu> probably solvable with a bit of sed
[22:49:51] <SpeakSpanishBoy> It's hard
[22:51:55] <gizmore> that's what she said
[22:56:17] <biberu> SpeakSpanishBoy: the entry point can just be a small script that updates the config from environment variables and then calls the original entry point
[22:57:51] <biberu> iirc you can mount and override it in your compose file, or build your own image from the base, but it seems easier to just mount the config files you want directly
[23:00:04] <SpeakSpanishBoy> yes, biberu. For now I made php.ini file and mounted with "volumes:"
