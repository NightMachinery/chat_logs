[12:09:37] <p`> gentoo's portage is loosely similar to ports, so sort of in that regard, but it's more source-based than binary (unless you run your own binpkg setup)

[13:35:59] <deksar> Truly good suggestions, thank you everyone! Will consider checking them one-by-one. By the way, have been just reading an interesting article stating... "However, RHEL made changes to the initial plan, deciding to halt any future CentOS releases. CentOS 8 has been declared the last downstream release that will be supported until December 2021." So, CentOS will soon die? I was interested in CentOS - *Sighs.

[13:54:27] <Guest28> xfrm is an IP framework for transforming packets (such as encrypting their payloads). This framework is used to implement the IPsec protocol suite (with the state object operating on the Security Association Database, and the policy object operating on
[13:54:28] <Guest28>        the Security Policy Database). It is also used for the IP Payload

[14:58:01] <lericson> then i use the stub resolver thing that goes to 127.0.0.53
[14:58:24] <lericson> if i do dig -x 10.0.1.4 @actual_dns_server it takes a ms

You can run something like https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun in a container, and then either find or create a container with `firefox` installed in it, and make it join the same network.

[19:09:24] <Ristovski> purpux: The complexity of dependency checks that portage has to do is several orders of magnitude larger than your standard package manager like apt, due to each package having USE flags which enable/disable features. So in some cases, it can take up to 10-15 minutes just for the dependency checking stage to finish for some moderately sized package.

[23:33:04] <ayecee> ah. i guess this is a little different then. here's how i picture it:

[23:33:50] <duds-> i would have to make it ignore \n\n i guess
[23:34:02] <duds-> however i can do that
[23:34:03] <ayecee> put the current line into the hold space, read the next line and check if it's blank. if it is, swap current and hold space and print. if it's not, append to the hold space, move the hold space to the current space and take out the newline.

[23:35:17] <ayecee> you're right, it's not. it's an extra step of cringe past uwu.
