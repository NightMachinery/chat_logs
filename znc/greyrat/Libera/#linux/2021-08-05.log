[04:07:37] <Helenah> I just read this:
[04:07:49] <Helenah> Increasing DPI while keeping the same resolution would require your display to grow larger.
[04:07:51] <Helenah> You probably want to increase Font Size, how to do that depends on the application you use.

[04:08:15] <Helenah> No I do NOT! That's the original fix I tried, changing font sizes on EVERYTHING is a nightmare.
[04:08:48] <Helenah> I like my 4k resolution, I just want to bit able to sit back in my sofa in comfort without inconsistant sizing everywhere. :/
[04:09:09] <akik> it has never been about dpi because the pixels have a fixed size
[04:10:01] <akik> but it affected how things were scaled
[04:10:24] <Helenah> Apparently there is this "Xft.dpi:<foo>" which needs to be added to ~/.Xdefaults
[04:10:40] <Helenah> No thank you, this is a multi-user system!
[04:10:44] <Helenah> It has to be set globally lol
[04:11:19] <Khaytsus> I just pass -dpi 192 to X's commandline

[11:12:31] <TJ-> 'man ext4' discussion of the 'verity' feature seems to infer it is possible to have a truely read-only file system (inc. superblocks) - it mentions using dm-verity to authenticate an entire block device. That seems to infer even the superblocks would be read-only (not incrementing the mount count, last mount time, etc.). Is that correct or is the 'man' misleading?

[11:17:25] <otisolsen70> I am migrating network config from /etc/network/interfaces to NetworkManager. One of my NICs (eth0) has an alias (eth0:0) configured with an additional static IP address. This is needed because I need a way to reliably connect to this headless device on any network. And I might not know what net config it will obtain from DHCP. NM appearently, will not allow me to have aliases. What alternative solution can I use?

[11:20:27] <Psi-Jack> Oh, with nmtui. 🙂

[11:23:07] <Psi-Jack> Hmm yeah. And why are you using NM?
[11:23:32] <otisolsen70> Psi-Jack, as I understand, what you are suggesting using nmtui is doing this "runtime" and if I reboot the changes made this way are gone. Correct?
[11:23:43] <Psi-Jack> I mean, you should've stopped using ethX:Y a long time ago for ip aliases, but, NetworkManager is an odd choice for servers in this case.
[11:24:10] <Psi-Jack> otisolsen70: No, nmtui, nmcli, makes changes to NetworkManager, persistently.
[11:24:11] <hexnewbie> Psi-Jack: ethX:Y is the only way Debian can add extra addresses by default (that doesn't involve adding them from e.g. rc.local)

[11:31:03] <otisolsen70> tirnanog, I then ran nmcli connection reload. It still does not have this ip address according to "ip addr"
[11:31:13] <Psi-Jack> hexnewbie: Eh. You can still do it manually, just not quite the same. 🙂
[11:31:38] <tirnanog> otisolsen70: hmm. I wonder why. seems like you've done everything correctly at this point.
[11:31:44] <Psi-Jack> hexnewbie: Fact is, the old ethX:Y method is deprecated, old, and uses an ioctl call (that part is the deprecated part).
[11:31:59] <Psi-Jack> The newer iproute2 method uses a faster more reliable netlink call.
[11:32:29] <tirnanog> otisolsen70: perhaps I was mistaken about it co-operating with an ipv4.method of "auto" but I thought it did. there's no technical reason that it shouldn't.
[11:33:31] <hexnewbie> iproute2 can still set an ethX:Y label (or any other form of label), now whether Debian uses iproute2 or the old calls underneath I don't know (or for that matter, care, if the deprecated call gets removed they'll switch if they haven't already)

The goal is to get a basic system running with VSOCK support to be used in confidential VMs, however I'm having trouble making basic /init work.

[14:53:55] <exfalso> script at /init. The kernel panics with errno -2. The initrd itself should work, as it's working with off-the-shelf kernels. Any idea what configuration I'm missing?

[15:39:07] <otisolsen70> I have enabled connectivity checks with NetworkManager. This works in that if ethernet is connected but not routed to internet, it will go ahead and use an available wifi.

How do I make it try another one until connectivity check succeeds?
[15:39:13] <autopsy> Ext4 doesn't have to use blocks at a named boundary.

[16:01:51] <mrmorphium33> good day! Maybe someone has an idea to my problem: I want make a pseudo-bridge between a VM and a host in the userspace (both systems are linux). There is a genius implementation called ixy (https://github.com/emmericp/ixy) which is an userspace network driver. Now I want to send all traffic via ixy from a tap-device (guest) to the host's bridge
[16:01:52] <mrmorphium33> and vice versa. My problem now is: i can send and receive packages in both ways, but when I send something to the tap-device it does not process it properly. For example: the arp-table shows always "incomplete" for the tap-device, even though i become proper arp replys from the host's bridge.
[16:01:56] <mrmorphium33> Thanks in advance!

Starting the server works fine, but when I try to stop it by clicking the red squre icon within PyCharm, it says "Worker with pid xxxx terminated due to signal 1", then it just restarts with a different PID, due to which I am unable to stop it unless I force kill the server from terminal.

[21:12:05] <Psi-Jack> And the problem existed 4 years ago, too. 😛
[21:12:34] <Psi-Jack> They literally implemented gnome to squelch that <super><anything> specifically, for any gnome/gtk apps.
[21:12:58] <kurahaupo> geirha: I still tend to thing that saying "amount" instead of "number" implies a continuous measure; my keyboard has 0.034m² of keys; or it has 0.16kg of keys (about 1.5 grams each)

[21:13:06] <Psi-Jack> Yet, KDE lets you literally re-define it right in the KDE settings. Completely. It's so bass-ackwards. :/
[21:13:42] <paulcarroty> maybe 3.34 or something really cared about keybindings in css
[21:13:46] <Psi-Jack> I really really have come to like Gnome, except for the excessive god-aweful level of handicapping they're doing to it.
[21:14:26] <paulcarroty> "It’s either
[21:14:26] <paulcarroty> * the order in which gnome-settings-daemon grabs those keybindings
[21:14:26] <paulcarroty> * the order in which mutter reloads existing keybindings (for example on keymap changes)
[21:14:26] <paulcarroty> But both implementations use GHashTable internally, so it boils down to the order in which hash tables iterate over elements. That order is explicitly documented as undefined."

Firefox is circling the drain in relevancy, it runs slower than Chrome, some websites are badly written and only work in Chrome, etc. Outside of extensions on Android container tabs on desktop, and better blocking capabilities (CNAME stuff through uBlock Origin), why am I even sticking with it?

[23:17:57] <hexnewbie> I used Phoenix because I didn't use non-web email. It wasn't really any faster or lighter on my computer. If I had used email, it would have been heavier to have it open together with Thunderbird (whenever that came one)

[23:35:31] <ayecee> why would it
[23:36:00] <tirnanog> because the purpose of journalctl -f is to observe events in real time? it's not rocket science. you can test this for yourself in a matter of seconds.

[23:37:34] <tirnanog> same reason that tail -f works just as well.

[23:42:27] <tirnanog> however, the point was not to feed any other application but, rather, to employ a simple while/read loop. there is no other application involved and therefore, the matter of whether the hypothetical application would buffer its own output stream is immaterial in this case.
