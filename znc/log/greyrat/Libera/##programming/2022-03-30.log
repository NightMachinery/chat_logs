[00:00:05] <ProfSimm> But maybe I should syntax sugar over it
[00:00:11] <ProfSimm> But it's powerful when you "Get it"
[00:00:14] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, Why do you need the "do" block then? Looks like the '&' is implicit with the ','.
[00:00:42] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, yeah, it's an interesting idea. Each line is dependent on the previous in a "boolean" way.
[00:00:45] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: the "do" block is just a function called "do" that takes a block and runs everything with "&" between them
[00:02:02] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: the first is the "raw" example
[00:02:12] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: technically every method is single expression, like in haskell

[00:02:26] <knusbaum> Just asking so I understand, not making suggestions.
[00:03:03] <apotheon> Maybe I missed some context here, but . . . is "something: (a, b) -> {" how you start a function definition?
[00:03:26] <apotheon> . . . or is it something else that just looks like a function definition?
[00:03:33] <knusbaum> Is do a special syntax then? Like do { list }. Trying to understand the difference between opening a function with " -> {" and the "do" syntax.
[00:03:52] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: the comma has lower precedence than | currently, but you could do this: https://pastebin.pl/view/f9d5ea24
[00:03:54] <bayaz> Title: Re: Untitled - Pastebin 
[00:04:32] <knusbaum> hmmm. Personally I would eliminate one of '&' or ','. It looks like they are the same operator with different precedence.
[00:04:41] <apotheon> Is "do" basically a return keyword, perhaps with special semantics?
[00:04:43] <knusbaum> But this is my "from-the-hip" opinion.
[00:04:57] <ProfSimm> potatoxel[m]: "something:" is a field/var/binding name (there's an implicit source-level block at the top), and   x -> y   is how you write a function with argument
[00:05:43] <apotheon> Can you create anonymous functions by just leaving "something:" out?

[00:08:08] <apotheon> I'm curious about the properties of the & where you need the first &.
[00:08:28] <apotheon> It's obviously not just an "and" operator.
[00:08:35] <apotheon> a conjunction, that is
[00:08:37] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: there's a class of values that are indeed just functions that returns themselves. Numbers, text, identifiers, and custom value types
[00:08:55] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, right, cool. That's exactly what I was wondering.
[00:09:07] <apotheon> interesting
[00:09:21] <apotheon> I don't hate this language, so far.
[00:09:23] <ProfSimm> apotheon: actually you don't need it, the first & or | is just stylistic and compiles to no-op :P I saw this in grammar parsers, they had  "foo = | a | b | c" (on new lines).

[00:11:32] *** Joins: el (~el@libera/staff/el)
[00:11:46] <apotheon> I'm still waiting to learn the part that makes me hate this language.  I haven't encountered it yet.
[00:11:54] <ProfSimm> the only odd part is that it's a bool expression that takes arguments, i.e. let's say we have:     foo & x-> bar | y -> baz.  x or y are the return result of "foo", depending on if it called "then" or "else' internally (this is not explicit in the syntax instead you return x or !y"
[00:12:06] <knusbaum> When/if one fails, the '|' logic allows you to execute a function with one argument that takes the error.
[00:12:18] *** Quits: swp (~Thunderbi@143.176.249.0) (Quit: swp)
[00:12:38] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, Is it really bool? What does 'e' contain in the error condition?
[00:12:51] <knusbaum> How does a function distinguish returning a value from returning an error?
[00:13:18] <apotheon> As fascinating as this is, I should go learn some Rust.
[00:13:25] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: every value in the language is truthy by default, even 0. You can flip it to falsey with the ! operator and some other ways. So e was returned as falsey, but it can be anything, like an error object
[00:13:29] <apotheon> ProfSimm: Let me know when you have a webpage for your programming language project.
[00:13:50] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, how do I create a "falsey" value with an error message, for example?
[00:13:53] <ProfSimm> apotheon: sure thx
[00:13:54] *** Joins: swp (~Thunderbi@143.176.249.0)
[00:14:22] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: basically the "boolean" aspect is like a second dimension to every value. There's no separate boolean type
[00:14:34] <knusbaum> like this? 'return !"my error message"'
[00:14:48] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: yeah. 
[00:14:49] <knusbaum> so that's a falsey value that is an error string.
[00:14:50] <knusbaum> Cool.
[00:15:08] <knusbaum> I like it.
[00:15:12] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: this is so you can treat errors as another return value
[00:15:42] <knusbaum> right.
[00:15:56] <ProfSimm> divide: (a, b) -> b != 0 & a/b | !"div by zero error"
[00:16:18] <knusbaum> So the function operator expects a list with one element, then? And it evaluates that element and returns the result?

[00:17:16] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: the function operator is just for reading input, otherwise what happens is the default expression evaluation. 
[00:17:36] <knusbaum> So by default a list evaluates each of its members, or what?
[00:17:40] <ProfSimm> I.e. -> doesn't create a function it just introduces input (if any)

[01:57:06] <pyzozord> huh looks like I produced only 1280 lines of text on irc
[01:57:07] <flaqoniun> The JIT inlines static, private, or final methods in general. And while public methods are also candidates for inlining, not every public method will necessarily be inlined. The JVM needs to determine that there's only a single implementation of such a method. Any additional subclass would prevent inlining and the performance will inevitably decrease.

[01:59:10] <ProfSimm> flaqoniun: "There are some other JVMs with tracing JITs, though: HotPath and Maxine, for example."

[02:00:12] <knusbaum> Why would you JIT a trace? What does that mean?
[02:00:13] <ProfSimm> A trace can embed more runtime conditions into the JIT, such as a class that's not statically known can be inlined into a trace
[02:00:32] *** Joins: o|||||o (~ol_greg@50-24-3-187.chstcmta05.res.dyn.suddenlink.net)
[02:01:00] <knusbaum> Ahh, I see. It collects particular traces of a run of a method and can inline whatever, even if it's not known at compile time, yeah?
[02:01:15] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: a trace is where a hot spot of the execution is "recorded" basically, including the types of the variables and so on, and code is produces for this trace. It's not based on compiling individual methods
[02:01:29] <knusbaum> I assumed that was all part of profiling.
[02:01:37] <knusbaum> Didn't realize HotSpot doesn't do all that.
[02:01:41] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: a trace can be a part of a method, or a series of method calls
[02:01:42] <nitrix> Yeah, the trace is informed of runtime information. It inlines everything during; the indirections, the loops, it identifies a "hot path" and makes that very very fast.
[02:02:02] <nitrix> A regular JIT usually doesn't cross function boundaries too much.
[02:02:11] <knusbaum> That's how I thought it worked, yeah. But it sounds like HotSpot doesn't do that.

[02:43:38] <BASHitup> I'm just getting confused because I keep thinking at times if I do something in as sudo ... it's creating a special sudo file that if altered could damage the entire directory structure 
[02:43:42] <epony> pyzozord, yeah.. I wanted to avoid bad connotations and not used pyzword
[02:43:54] <BASHitup> At one point, I was in root under something like sudo -i 
[02:43:55] <knusbaum> BASHitup, What do you mean by "special sudo file?"
[02:43:59] <kee> BASHitup: root is just a normal user.
[02:44:06] <epony> but since you said "psasword" it was kind of warranted
[02:44:06] <BASHitup> Then I started copying the .weechat folder
[02:44:07] <kee> Any files it creates are owned by it, same as any other user.
[02:44:26] <pyzozord> epony: you are mixing it up :P
[02:44:36] <kee> BASHitup: You can chown them to whatever user and group should own it, after you've done that.
[02:44:40] <BASHitup> Whatever I did, I damaged the configs to where my desktop disappeared on reboot and the OS appeared as though it was a fresh Ubuntu install. 
[02:44:46] <BASHitup> chown -R 
[02:44:49] <BASHitup> Yes, I know that too 
[02:44:53] <pyzozord> ok too late, need to sleep :P
[02:44:56] <BASHitup> chown -R <user> file 
[02:45:11] <BASHitup> or the bit changes with the digits ... like chown 777 or something 
[02:45:13] <knusbaum> BASHitup, why did you use sudo to copy your weechat directory?
[02:45:20] <kee> cp -a will preserve ownership, I think.
[02:45:33] <BASHitup> Because I've had cases where it will stop the copy as regular user. it will refuse to copy 
[02:45:38] <BASHitup> But I think I'm missing something 
[02:45:50] <kee> This is why it doesn't let you log in as root.
[02:45:54] <BASHitup> I'm probably trying to copy config files that are under root ... copying them as a regular user 
[02:45:57] <knusbaum> haha
[02:45:57] <BASHitup> I think that's what's going on 
[02:46:06] <kee> root can do everything.
[02:46:09] <BASHitup> Whatever it is, it's confusing me 
[02:46:12] <kee> There aren't two permission levels.
[02:46:13] <apotheon> 22:04 < knusbaum> Some dude smacked some other dude because he didn't like a joke about his wife. (I think)
[02:46:15] <BASHitup> You can do everything as root, yes 
[02:46:18] <apotheon> That is apparently incorrect.
[02:46:22] <knusbaum> BASHitup, maybe. If you provided some of the commands you're using we may be able to tell you more.
[02:46:29] <apotheon> It seems that Will liked the joke until he realized his wife didn't.
[02:46:31] <BASHitup> yeah, so I get that you can become root, then go to /home/<user> ... 
[02:46:32] <kee> There are basically infinity non-overlapping permission levels.
[02:46:37] <BASHitup> So you can manipulate all user files under root 
[02:46:51] <kee> Don't become root. That hides the permission model from you!
[02:46:52] <BASHitup> K, but you can answer this one question 
[02:46:59] <BASHitup> ... If I create a folder or a file as sudo 
[02:47:07] <knusbaum> BASHitup, generally there shouldn't be user files under /root .
[02:47:09] <BASHitup> Say I do sudo gedit ... Or sudo mkdir ... 
[02:47:24] <kee> It's owned by root. The default mode flags mean you can't read or write to it.
[02:47:31] <BASHitup> In certain situations, does it automatically change the permissions to a root ownership? 
[02:47:37] <kee> You could set them with chmod, so you can, while root still owns it.
[02:47:43] <kee> BASHitup: In certain situations, yeah.
[02:47:47] <kee> gedit, almost definitely.
[02:47:55] <kee> nano doesn't.
[02:47:56] <BASHitup> You cannot save a text file in Ubuntu unless it's created with sudo 
[02:47:59] <BASHitup> I do know that 
[02:48:04] <kee> …?
[02:48:07] <knusbaum> If you are *creating* a file or directory, then yes. If you are modifying an existing file, likely not.
[02:48:13] <BASHitup> or a program to execute 
[02:48:19] <kee> If your text editor creates a new program…
[02:48:23] <BASHitup> so I do gedit fuckstick 
[02:48:27] <knusbaum> BASHitup, that's not correct.
[02:48:32] <BASHitup> I can't save "fuckstick" without sudo gedit 
[02:48:34] <kee> BASHitup: Your fundamental misunderstanding is thinking that root isn't a user.

[02:48:46] <knusbaum> BASHitup, You can perfectly well save files and make programs without needing sudo.
[02:48:55] <kee> You can't write directly to /, though.
[02:49:03] <BASHitup> No, it worked 
[02:49:06] <BASHitup> That's right 
[02:49:13] <BASHitup> You're right 
[02:49:33] <knusbaum> BASHitup, You shouldn't probably be doing these things as root.
[02:49:37] <knusbaum> Don't run your editor as root.
[02:49:42] <BASHitup> Or maybe I'm editing a program already created and I have to edit it as root to save it. I know for a fact I've edited programs and it wouldn't let me save them when I opened them without sudo. 
[02:49:47] <BASHitup> I damn well knw that for a fact 
[02:49:47] <knusbaum> (except in very specific circumstances)
[02:49:57] <BASHitup> So, I get in the habit of creating all programs with sudo 
[02:50:06] <kee> BASHitup: You shouldn't ever use sudo.
[02:50:09] <knusbaum> BASHitup, that's a bad idea.
[02:50:26] <BASHitup> Well, Kali linux used to default with root 
[02:50:27] <knusbaum> BASHitup, do you know how to check permissions on a file?
[02:50:32] <BASHitup> They made it right, changed that 
[02:50:45] <kee> BASHitup: Kali is not a normal OS.
[02:50:46] <BASHitup> But there are skilled admins that use a lot of root executions against your advice. 
[02:50:54] <BASHitup> I know it's not, dude 
[02:51:02] <BASHitup> We used it during my cybersecurity program 
[02:51:06] <kee> They run a lot of stuff as root because they're skilled.
[02:51:27] <EdFletcher> "You cannot save a text file in Ubuntu unless it's created with sudo" huh?!?
[02:51:29] <BASHitup> Ironically, it's an advanced pentesting OS ... It's not for people new to Linux. But in my program, for the vast majority of students, that was there first exposure to Linux

[02:54:23] <kee> Anyway: user and group. In chown, that's user:group (I think).
[02:54:24] <BASHitup> It is advanced and it's probably many of the times why people inadvertently destroy their distro 
[02:54:32] <BASHitup> It's the reason I use Clonezilla 
[02:54:45] <knusbaum> BASHitup, certainly it's very easy to blow up your system by running things as root.
[02:54:49] <BASHitup> And you can't just "Not" use root 
[02:54:53] <kee> Sure you can.
[02:54:55] <knusbaum> That's why it should be used very sparingly.
[02:55:11] <BASHitup> The way this started becoming a recurring problem is that .weechat would mess up. 
[02:55:21] <BASHitup> It would start at random with none of the chats or channels saved. 
[02:55:26] <BASHitup> Despite having the right scripts running 
[02:55:33] <BASHitup> So, I had a correct config saved.

[02:55:52] <BASHitup> So, I'd copy the good config back into ~/
[02:56:04] <kee> flaqoniun: Well, setuid to some user with a group that has mounting permissions.
[02:56:07] <BASHitup> But during points, I'd go "sudo nautilus" 
[02:56:14] <flaqoniun> what is mounting permissions
[02:56:19] <kee> Permission to mount stuff.
[02:56:20] <BASHitup> And there was even some informaton about how you shouldn't open a GUI in root 
[02:56:26] <flaqoniun> to a root subdir?
[02:56:36] <knusbaum> BASHitup, yes, that's generally a bad idea.
[02:56:38] <kee> Er, sure… You generally mount to /media, though.
[02:56:45] <flaqoniun> /media owned by root?
[02:56:46] <BASHitup> Well, then there's stuff like nmap ... And you can't run many powerful nmap commands without sudo 
[02:56:56] <BASHitup> sudo mount or sudo umount 
[02:56:58] <BASHitup> Oh, and gedit 
[02:57:02] <BASHitup> No, wait 
[02:57:04] <kee> flaqoniun: Ubuntu is set up so you don't need to run sudo commands to mount a USB stick.
[02:57:04] <BASHitup> I meant, gparted

[03:11:22] <piou> if I do want a root shell, then I absolutely want sudo -i and not sudo -s
[03:11:25] <kee> Hmm. We do need hidden files actually.
[03:11:29] <kee> BASHitup, you're right.
[03:11:42] <BASHitup> Yet the Ubuntu channel didn't understand any of this 
[03:11:43] <kee> Er, wait, no, we don't. Never mind.
[03:11:53] <BASHitup> I'd hint at these discrepencies and the mods would get all riled up 
[03:11:58] <kee> BASHitup: Discrepencies?
[03:12:41] <epony> so, what was your original question? ;-)
[03:12:59] <kee> We don't need -a because ~/.weechat/weechat.conf (the file we're expecting to find in the ls -l output) doesn't start with `.` .
[03:13:12] <BASHitup> So ... anyway, I can at least establish one fact 
[03:13:13] <kee> Doing ls -al ~ and trying to find .weechat, yes we'd need -a.

[03:13:44] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, Microsoft Access?
[03:13:55] <kee> Microsoft Access, but good.
[03:13:57] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: I think they canceled that one
[03:14:01] <BASHitup> A) When using a command with sudo such as sudo gparted, the obvious answer and you don't have to be an experienced Linux user to infer this, is that you are not changing anything about the program. Or sudo nmap. And I feel like a dumbass pointing out the obvious 
[03:14:09] <BASHitup> Like, OK, "Yeah, who doesn't know that" 
[03:14:12] <ProfSimm> Microsoft Access is just a form for SQL no?
[03:14:17] <piou> (btw -A is probably a better habit than -a)

[03:15:02] <flaqoniun> oh hhmm daemon could work without root but it also needs CAP_SYS_CHROOT to call setns(2)

[03:15:12] <kee> ProfSimm: Because we need them to exist.
[03:15:18] <kee> The time came ages ago.
[03:15:20] <knusbaum> Yes.
[03:15:50] <BASHitup> And I just answered my question 
[03:16:17] <kee> BASHitup: There is something special about sudo, though.
[03:16:23] <kee> It's got the setuid permission bit set.
[03:16:34] <BASHitup> You have to open or execute certain things with sudo ... which doesn't chane file permissions. But if you run certain commands like mkdir, that does change the permission value or ownership of the file 
[03:16:35] <kee> This means that, when you run it (if you have permission to execute it), it runs as the user who owns it.

[03:16:59] <kee> BASHitup: It doesn't "change" the ownership of the directory. Directories are owned by the users who create them. :-)
[03:17:18] <kee> It was always owned by root, from the moment of its creation. (This is pedantry.)
[03:17:23] <BASHitup> hold on. My wife is ranting. 
[03:17:26] <BASHitup> I'll be back 
[03:17:37] <knusbaum> BASHitup, right. The only thing that sudo changes is *who* is running a program. If root creates a directory, root owns the directory. That's orthogonal to sudo.
[03:17:38] <BASHitup> sudo mkdir ... you are creating that effectively as though you are root 
[03:17:55] <kee> BASHitup: More than that: `mkdir` is root.
[03:17:58] <knusbaum> BASHitup, yes. mkdir is being run as the user root.
[03:18:39] <knusbaum> All sudo does is change the user a program is run as.

[03:19:04] <knusbaum> not quite
[03:19:07] <kee> Oh well. The point stands.
[03:20:26] <BASHitup> Well, and then ... 
[03:20:43] <BASHitup> But this doesn't answer my question what I'm about to say since I changed my user permissions in visudo 
[03:20:52] <BASHitup> So what I'm seeing probably isn't the default

[03:21:38] <kee> Also, don't do that. You shouldn't be running sudo enough to need that.

[03:26:06] <BASHitup> K. so you try <su> alone and put in the same password you use for sudo commands in Ubuntu 
[03:26:07] <epony> that part is the same

[03:26:10] <BASHitup> Tell me what happens 
[03:26:16] <kee> BASHitup: That just means no password is set.
[03:26:21] <kee> Just like Administrator on Windows.
[03:26:28] <kee> You can't log in. Doesn't mean it's not there.
[03:26:29] <BASHitup> And do the same on OpenSUSE 
[03:26:41] <kee> BASHitup: You don't know and you're not listening.
[03:26:45] <kee> Are you here to learn or not?
[03:27:18] <BASHitup> It doesn't matter like 95% of the time. But, if you screw up the permissions to the point that you can't use "sudo" as a regular user and there is no "root" account i.e., administrator account, it's not easy to fix 
[03:27:33] <kee> root is more like SYSTEM on Windows, actually.
[03:27:36] <epony> it's easy, you go single user mode
[03:27:42] *** Quits: pmercado (~pmercado@190.22.73.57) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[03:27:48] <epony> and you can do that at boot time
[03:27:48] <BASHitup> And even that's confusing since technically, the regular user is administrator with or without the "root" account. 
[03:27:52] <kee> epony: You can't go single user mode unless a root password is set,
[03:27:58] <kee> At least, not with systemd. Or can you?

[03:28:34] <kee> We're telling you you're wrong, though.
[03:28:38] <BASHitup> I'd start arguing with the mods and it got rough 
[03:28:45] <epony> different systems have slight differences in these details, but generally, you have options to reinstate control of your system if you fail at user management
[03:28:54] <BASHitup> I have done that, yes

[03:29:08] <epony> don't worry much about it, it is recoverable
[03:29:33] <kee> Oh, yeah, you can get into single-user mode without a password by passing kernel options, can't you?
[03:29:53] <BASHitup> I think this is it: chown -R root:root /etc/sudoers.d

[03:44:55] *** Joins: Likorn (~Likorn@c114-150.icpnet.pl)
[03:45:03] <BASHitup> So you have to image - either logically or physically 
[03:45:06] <BASHitup> That's part of it 
[03:45:10] <BASHitup> Have to copy the drive 
[03:45:11] <kee> Yup.

[03:45:32] <BASHitup> Partition tables 
[03:45:34] <BASHitup> Artificats etc 
[03:45:36] <knusbaum> BASHitup, how do you image a drive?
[03:45:38] <kee> Before you image the drive, you should take a hash of the image.
[03:45:42] <kee> knusbaum: Autopsy does it for you.
[03:45:46] <knusbaum> ahh.
[03:45:47] <kee> You just clicky the button.
[03:45:51] <knusbaum> ahh.
[03:45:55] <epony> you're not breaking anything, if you have no precious information to attest the loss of functionality with loss of data and loss of capability
[03:45:56] <jacekowski> first and only thing you do to the drive is clone it onto your NAS/whatever storage you have
[03:46:05] <jacekowski> and then you work on that image only
[03:46:08] <kee> s/Before/After but before anything else/
[03:46:10] <BASHitup> Well, you can image a drive using Clonezilla at home ... But on a forensic job, you'd use EnCase or Autopsy. That's not like a hard process, dude 
[03:46:12] <epony> so, it's just "fooling around"
[03:46:19] <kee> BASHitup: Clonezilla doesn't image drives.
[03:46:23] <BASHitup> I had to image my Ubuntu drive before I broke it to recover it 
[03:46:37] <BASHitup> You can watch a YouTube video on this stuff to learn how to image it. 
[03:46:40] <kee> jacekowski++
[03:46:52] <kee> Also take a hash of the image and write it down in the boxk on the paperwork.
[03:46:55] <BASHitup> It's not like "Top-Secret" knowledge that only an experienced forensic analyst can understand 
[03:46:59] <epony> that's not how you do it, but it's a way to do such things with systems you can't understand and manage.. like Windows and MacOS (shots fired)

[04:48:29] <BASHitup> Ubuntu is nice but you guys aren't going to get what you want out of it. Ubuntu is the closest thing to Windows or MacOS for Linux users in my mind. It runs heavy, looks sleek but isn't for power users.

[04:49:36] <beaky> the most minimal is using unary natural numbers and then adding a sign
[04:49:37] <BASHitup> ... Well. For one, it doesn't come with a Root user in the sense of "Administrator" account. Which we were talking about. Well, so there are multiple ways to look at this ... 
[04:49:53] <BASHitup> There are Ubuntu servers which are used in production environments ... Just like CentOS servers. 
[04:49:54] <kee> BASHitup: Power users don't use root as an admin account.

[04:50:19] <BASHitup> Disclosure: I've never used any Linux environment in a production environment. So my opinions are all based from the perspective of a home desktop user 
[04:50:34] <flaqoniun> ok beaky that might be too "minimal" i mean code density-wise
[04:50:43] <flaqoniun> i'll research this a bit though
[04:50:48] <flaqoniun> thanks.
[04:50:50] <kee> Running root as your main, as a desktop user, is an excellent way to get malware taking over your whole system.
[04:50:51] <arahael> Ubuntu is a *really* popular production server OS these days.
[04:51:03] <BASHitup> That having been said, I find Ubuntu the most attractive as a daily driver. The way the interface looks is sleek. The software center is straightforward. Most Windows or Mac programs are avaiable 
[04:51:04] <epony> BASHitup, you mean on *buntu you can log in with a combination of Enter Esc and Ctrl to bypass authentication or that you can recover your encrypted files without knowing your passphrases
[04:51:30] <epony> cause, that's the level of service you have to cover up to
[04:51:36] <BASHitup> Yeah, haha, I don't know about that but now that you're saying that 
[04:51:48] <BASHitup> If there's a way for someone to break through my LUKS LVM2 encryption, I need to know! 
[04:51:51] <epony> secure "manageability" and "data retention" compliance
[04:51:58] <BASHitup> I know that stuff can get taken from the RAM while the system is one 
[04:52:06] <kee> Windows: if you put a sticker saying “locked” on it, it's locked!
[04:52:14] <BASHitup> But once the system is shut-off there's a way to break the FDE? 
[04:52:19] <_73> BASHitup: It is preposterous to claim that Ubuntu isn't good for power users. It has access to apt repos so you have access to a ridiculous amount of software that can suit every need of any *power user*. You can also change the default root/sudo behaviour.
[04:52:22] <kee> BASHitup: Only if you run things as root, can someone nick stuff from your RAM.
[04:52:30] <kee> Unless they do rowhammer, or a timing attack.
[04:52:40] <BASHitup> K, so compared to what, man 
[04:52:48] <BASHitup> It can be used as a power-user system
[04:53:07] <BASHitup> But, compared to something like Debian or CentOS ... Those distros are not as used for desktop daily drivers 
[04:53:09] <kee> The difference between distros is pretty much one of aesthetic preference.
[04:53:11] <epony> or a DMA attack or a ROP attack and your system just behaves as if nothing happened
[04:53:17] <kee> BASHitup: Debian is my daily driver.
[04:53:26] <BASHitup> You can use any linux distro as a daily 
[04:53:26] <kee> epony: We're assuming the hardware's not that buggy.
[04:53:31] <BASHitup> But should you and why would you 
[04:53:37] <BASHitup> I also have Debian on this machine in a dual boot 
[04:53:37] <kee> Inserting "buggy" hardware in the machine doesn't count.
[04:53:51] <kee> Physical access means you can just use a can of compressed air, then unplug the RAM.
[04:53:51] <epony> note the "or" and not "and" in the above scenario
[04:54:07] <kee> What's ROP, then?

[05:01:35] <BASHitup> I can't even remember how it works. But I remember it being simple 
[05:01:36] <arahael> BASHitup: flatpak and snap solve most of the same issues, except snap is ubuntu specific.
[05:01:59] <BASHitup> Snap actually can slow down the system. I've had to change things in fstab at one point because it slowed down the boot 
[05:02:09] <BASHitup> Would hold up the boot for like literally a minute longer 
[05:02:12] *** Joins: joev (~joev@user/joev)
[05:02:15] <arahael> Interesting.  flatpak is mostly just a container.
[05:02:53] <BASHitup> It's not like Docker though is it? 
[05:03:30] <arahael> Depends on how you look at these things, I guess.    But Docker also uses container technology.
[05:04:02] <epony> kee, for that you have even rowhammer, creating a memory fault that you can exploit.. and knowing where the symbols and function calls are in binaries, gives you a serious leverage.. to exploit remotely with arbitrary runtimes feeding through watering hole attacks (example PoP and CDN and proxy servers)
[05:04:48] <epony> you can exfiltrate data from CPU caches too, through the transient execution vulnerabilities
[05:06:02] <epony> people still don't care ;-) and run code off the internet fed to their runtimes without their knowledge and chance of having a decisive control of that
[05:06:15] <kee> Except for rowhammer and timing attacks, there isn't a way to do it, in practice.
[05:06:18] <arahael> epony: There was a very serious data leak, it turns out that file pipes leaked data in linux systems.

[05:07:43] <epony> as they give out reusable gadgets and can be stuffed from user input or otherwise you can attack your application runtime through payload that fills its garbage collector memory with data it receives

[05:10:32] <knusbaum> It's the internet and the code is free (as in freedom) so people do what they want. There's no central organization saying "let's have 100 distributions."
[05:10:45] <knusbaum> So we get endless variety.
[05:10:46] <epony> it's like SysV to SysD conversion, some improvements and some degradation, but it's pervasive and landscape "generalised" on Linux mainstream distributions
[05:10:52] <Sqaure> Is systemd part of linux? If so, is there some effort removing it?

[05:10:58] <Sqaure> (by linux devS)
[05:11:18] <knusbaum> Sqaure, systemd is a part of some linux distributions (namely the init system)
[05:11:28] <epony> Linux is just the kernel and some libraries and headers and tools for it..
[05:11:32] <knusbaum> But it's not integral to the linux kernel. I'm running linux without systemd right now.

[05:13:17] <epony> it's not e very serious problem, unless your business depends on some of its qualities
[05:13:26] <knusbaum> Sqaure, It's also a relatively recent addition to linux distributions. It came in with a lot of noise. A lot of users didn't like the change.
[05:13:43] <Sqaure> Ok
[05:13:53] <knusbaum> Or maybe more accurately, they didn't like *how the change was done*.
[05:14:00] <epony> cause it's not a Unix-like design, it's an Apple-like and Windows-like design
[05:14:01] <knusbaum> or both maybe.
[05:14:01] <kee> We needed something like systemd. Systemd was just the first one where the developer made an effort to get it popular.

[05:17:18] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, My main goals were to separate the spreadsheet concept from the presentation and have it be like a pseudo-programming language, but one where you could render the output as a spreadsheet.
[05:17:19] <kee> BASHitup: You can't manipulate or change systemd.
[05:17:29] <kee> Random programs depend on it, and it's a monolith.
[05:17:37] <kee> You can't run the Atom text editor unless your init system is systemd.
[05:17:48] <BASHitup> How can you not ... You can stop certain processes from loading during systemd 
[05:17:51] <knusbaum> ProfSimm, basically like a regular spreadsheet but you could write the sheet in terms of a program (A1:A10 = whatever; ...) and then dump data into it.
[05:17:53] <ProfSimm> knusbaum: we could exchange ideas, I've spent bunch of time reading thinking and plotting about this
[05:17:54] <epony> you can also use OOP without it's full range of tricks and capabilities and where it is an advantage, so no tool or capability sucks per se, what sucks is inseparable bundles, lack of control and precision, and non-optional non-removable non-disposable forced-on presets and mandatory decisions that force-propagate in your designs too when you build on top of that (captivity and degradation of engineering control)
[05:17:59] <beaky> nice i have to try atom someday i heard it it like vscode which is like modern emacs

[06:17:50] <Sqaure> Though not CT, this graph looked like it. And a cool overview on categorization of Lambda calculus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube
[06:17:51] <bayaz> Title: Lambda cube - Wikipedia 
[06:19:33] <Sqaure> I gather it represents some sort of classification of feature sets of theorised languages. Some that might not have been fully implemented?! 
[06:20:32] <beaky> yes each corner of the cube is a programming language, and when moving up or right on the cube you add more features in the language depending on the term or type dimension
[06:21:22] <Sqaure> i found it tonight so thats why i had to bore you with it. =D
[06:21:43] <epony> it's about the nesting level of "functionality"

[11:24:12] <ProfSimm> OK but here's the thing... do you think Lisp was right to do (func arg arg) or should it have been  fun (arg arg)

[11:24:35] <sonny> they have a pretty good reason ... who cares about parsing
[11:24:41] <sonny> especially back then

[11:25:40] <sonny> oop is weird
[11:25:46] <sonny> rpn and infix lol

[11:26:48] <sonny> explain
[11:27:36] <ProfSimm> should the arguments be grouped alone and passed as a single argument to the function, or grouped together with the function, where they're passed one by one
[11:27:50] <sonny> that is syntax
[11:27:56] <ProfSimm> it's not syntax
[11:28:22] <ProfSimm> It's different expression tree
[11:28:23] <sonny> so you are talking abi?
[11:28:42] <ProfSimm> I'm doing named parameters and it helps to treat the arguments as a single unit

[21:16:01] <pulse> yet another claims (as answer to "can you patent a herb?"): "The answer is 'certainly yes' – provided, however, the product or formulation is new, inventive and has a technical character. Intellectual property (IP), such as a patent, is critical in protecting such products or formulations. Patents are the “holy grail” for herbal & food supplements products or formulations."
[21:16:09] <pulse> in other words, it's a %$#show
[21:16:12] <austincheney> discoveries should not be patentable, because they aren't new.  They just weren't known before, but they were there none the less.  I don't have any problem with new plants being patentable though.

[23:47:14] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@202-130-210-100.ip4.superloop.com)
[23:47:26] <dTal> What are some (jit?) compiled languages with a REPL that let you inspect the generated code? I'm doing a little benchmark of sorts
[23:47:44] <DPA> I think the dangerous was probably more about using what is basically eval for this. Or at least I hope so. Also, beware of "javascript:" URIs.
[23:48:10] <davros> ProfSimm, can't they take you to nasty places with viruses etc

[23:48:32] <davros> you want to know before you actually go to a url explicitely, eg between sites i think

[23:49:08] <ProfSimm> davve: a site that redirects you to a site with viruses is basically already a site with a virus
[23:49:11] <davros> anyway what i had in mind was the ability to put portals in my 3d scene that could go to URLS.. but i think i'd want them to actually show you the link adress you're about to visit
[23:49:38] <bomb> 3d scene? you're making a game?
[23:49:40] <davros> lets say its a site with user content, including user submitted URLs
[23:49:53] <davros> bomb yes, i'm making a rust/wasm/webgl engine

[23:50:16] <Toneloc> Davis - excellent, have you done much with wasm?
[23:50:42] <Toneloc> * Davros
[23:50:48] <davros> https://vimeo.com/686548572  current state of it
[23:51:06] <davros> bomb because my main interest is engines, not the end result
[23:51:28] <bomb> uh oh
[23:51:35] <davros> javascript is an uncivilized language
[23:51:45] *** Quits: oldmagic (~oldmagic@user/oldmagic) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:51:52] <bomb> web is an uncivilized platform as well
[23:52:03] <kee> Let's all go and civilise it!
[23:52:13] <davros> that is true but i was doing this rust engine and got talked into porting it into the web
[23:52:14] <Toneloc> Davros - that's really impressive
[23:52:31] <Toneloc> How long have you been working on it?
[23:52:49] *** Joins: oldmagic (~oldmagic@user/oldmagic)
[23:52:59] <davros> this came together over the past year. i had an earlier version shelved for 2 years , i had gone back to C++
[23:53:20] <davros> the earlier version was just a basic fly around a scene
[23:53:38] <DPA> User submitted URLs can indeed be dangerous. If someone clicks them, it opens from the sites origin, and may be able to access things on the same site other things wouldn't. And if things like javascript: isn't prevented, anything could be locally injected into the site. With service workers, even permanently.
[23:53:47] <Toneloc> Davros - could you go to rust>typescript> wasm ?
[23:53:58] <davros> rust compiles direct to wasm
[23:54:42] <Toneloc> Davros - even better!
[23:55:06] <davros> i suppose user submitted URLs can be filtered through some approved domains, and give a really big warning if going elsewhere
[23:55:08] <Toneloc> Are you seeing much of a performance difference between rust Vs wasm?
[23:55:27] <davros> yes. the game is about 15% faster native
[23:55:43] *** Joins: Akuli (~Akuli@213.216.211.202)
[23:56:10] <davros> but its fast enough that the promise of being able to "just click and play" is interesting enough to keep going with it
[23:56:31] <davros> it takes a few seconds to start up and it continues loading the textures asynchronously as you play it
[23:56:41] <davros> it loads low res versions first
[23:56:50] <Toneloc> A 15% increase by going wasm is certainly great
[23:57:17] <kee> 15% decrease, right?
[23:57:21] <davros> i mean browser-wasm is 15% slower than the desktop native version i think, aprox
[23:57:27] <davros> yeah kee
[23:57:28] <Toneloc> Davros - kind of a lazyload approach then
[23:57:33] <davros> exactly
[23:57:41] <kee> davros: What happens if it doesn't load on time?
[23:57:47] <davros> you see blurry stuff
[23:58:00] <kee> So the lowest-res version is guaranteed present.
[23:58:31] <davros> i have a mode where it can load the scenery async aswell and it fills in gradually but i think i prefer to load the geometry, then you start playing,but untextured, and the textures gradually fill in
[23:58:45] <Toneloc> Davros - 15% for not having to install, as you say click and play - is definitely worthwhile
[23:58:45] <davros> i can try and use a blur filter to make it look more deliberate later
[23:58:52] <davros> yeah i figure
[23:58:55] <kee> You should have a lo-res geometry feature.
[23:59:07] <davros> yeah eventually i will add that aswell
[23:59:07] <kee> Then speedrunners will cut their Wi-Fi to gain an edge.
