[00:22:51] <baguvix> is there a way to find the % of difference between the two numbers? ex: i need to use this  for an optimization where i'v access to start, end and middle of a list. start is always 0, end is `size - 1` so let's consider there're 20 items so the size is 20 and the last index is 19(assuming index starts from 0) so in this case, the middle index is gonna be 19/2 which is 9(floor value), so if i've to access
[00:22:57] <baguvix> the item 7 for example, it's better to start from the middle and go back. but how will i find if it's good to start from middle or from the last or from the start? is there a way where i can generically calculate the % of the given index from the start, middle and end items on the list such that i can take the optimal route?

[01:33:41] <baconology> can primes be negative, why or why not, is this a stupid question?
[01:34:02] <river> they can't be negative
[01:34:05] <rex> baconology: it's not stupid and it depends on your definition
[01:34:39] <river> the integers can be divided into classes: zero {0}, units {1,-1}, primes {2,3,5,...}
[01:34:57] <baconology> you solve that by putting negative in its own set
[01:34:58] <river> every integer is either zero or a unit * primes
[01:34:59] <baconology> but -7 is prime?
[01:35:05] <river> -7 is -1 * 7
[01:35:30] <river> you could say that -7 is an irreducible
[01:35:38] <river> irreducible would be primes and negative primes
[01:35:40] <rex> river: is this really that strictly defined?
[01:36:08] <river> rex, well when we work with rings extended with algebraic numbers this stuff becomes useful
[01:36:20] <river> like in Z[i] you have 4 units {1,-1,i,-i}
[01:36:28] <river> so every "prime" has 4 versions
[01:36:54] <river> it's easier to call them irreducibles and not worry about always picking the "positive" one, especially since they can be complex now
[01:37:00] <baconology> oh i never thought about i and -i
[01:37:27] <baconology> so 0+7i is prime
[01:37:33] <river> for example 2+i is irreducible in Z[i]
[01:37:38] <river> 5 is no longer a prime number in that ring
[01:38:16] <rex> ok you can definitely define it to be restricted to the positive integers, which makes sense from an arithmetic point of view. iirc my algebra textbooks they went around that problem by defining prime and maximal ideals
[01:38:54] <rex> that way it can even be extendet beyond ℤ
[01:39:03] <rex> omg my typing is horrible today
[01:39:57] <rex> baconology: but to make sure we can help you appropriately :) why do you ask?
[01:41:05] <baconology> i was just imagining them in my head and figured they must be mirrored out in the other direction
[01:41:22] <baconology> but mirrored out into complex space just blew my mind a bit

[01:42:06] <baconology> but, of course
[01:42:41] <rex> baconology: well yes there are certain characeristics they still have, which might make them also "prime", but the theorem of unique prime factor decomposition wouldn't be true on ℤ if you'd allow negative prime numbers
[01:42:54] <rex> e.g. 49 = -7^2 = 7^2
[01:43:21] <ski> one definition could be that ⌜p⌝ is prime iff whenever ⌜d⌝ divides ⌜p⌝, then either ⌜d⌝ is associated with ⌜1⌝, or with ⌜p⌝
[01:43:34] <Whattever> conventionally, primes are just natural numbers though
[01:43:45] <ski> rex : yes, it would, if you state that the factorization is unique, up to associated elements
[01:43:56] <ski> (and up to reordering, as usual)
[01:44:32] <rex> yes but there you use even more uniqueness :)
[01:44:41] <rex> *loose
[01:45:19] <baconology> the only thing that gives you 1 for -7 is -7 and -1 so i think that's prime
[01:45:21] <baconology> negative prime
[01:45:38] * baconology nods, convinced
[01:45:41] <rex> -7 * (-1) = +7
[01:46:37] <baconology> i like ski's efinition
[01:47:36] <rex> baconology: as you can see, one can lead endless discussions about whether they should be prime (as people have discussed if 1 should be prime), but the thing river said is, the "negative primes" are irreducible
[01:47:54] <rex> which is the characteristic they share with the positve primes
[01:49:24] <rex> i think what ski mentioned was that in general rings, when not only studying integers, there are ways to define prime elements without the abililty to distinguish between positive and negative ones
[01:49:26] <ski> ⌜p⌝ is a prime element iff whenever ⌜p⌝ divides a product ⌜a₀⋅a₁⋅a₂⋅⋯⋅aₙ₋₂⋅aₙ₋₁⌝, then ⌜p⌝ divides some factor ⌜aₖ⌝ (for some index ⌜k⌝, with ⌜0 ≤ k < n⌝)
[01:50:36] <baconology> im pretty deep in stack exchange now on gaussian integers
[01:50:49] <ski> (note that the case ⌜n = 0⌝ here neatly covers the condition that ⌜p⌝ should not be a divisor of ⌜1⌝, should not be an associated element of ⌜1⌝)

[06:06:29] <newpy> is there a good site for textbook recommendations?
[06:06:43] <newpy> wanting to find a good probability textbook
[06:06:48] <somiaj> DrMax: are you taking about the eculidian algorithim?
[06:06:56] <DrMax> yup
[06:07:31] <somiaj> well it is nammed after euculid, so quite old
[06:07:48] <somiaj> it apperentally appeared in Euclid's Elements.
[06:08:02] <DrMax> ok, but that's not the question: it was done using successive subtractions
[06:08:26] <DrMax> then at one point, someone realized it'd be much more efficient to use remainders (therefore div/mod)
[06:08:35] <DrMax> I want to know who that was
[06:09:07] <PlanckWalk> Euclid
[06:09:36] <PlanckWalk> div/mod is called Euclidean division for a reason.
[06:09:41] <DrMax> Euclid did it using lines and successive subtraction
[06:09:49] <DrMax> ...
[06:11:26] <PlanckWalk> Although Elements presents successive subtraction as a simple proof step, there are other works that show that algorithms for division were well known.
[06:13:09] <PlanckWalk> Much as Peano Arithmetic has axioms for addition in terms of successor operation, nobody expects that Peano knew only that method for computing sums.
[06:13:20] <DrMax> I'm not asking any of that. Just who, in print, replaced the classical Euclid BC subtraction by explicit division
[06:13:27] <DrMax> I know they're equivalent
[06:13:35] <DrMax> I'm not asking about Peano either
[06:14:37] <PlanckWalk> I don't know who first put it explicitly in print.
[06:14:47] <PlanckWalk> Such a work is probably lost.
[06:15:25] <PlanckWalk> I don't know which of the works historians know about might have it
[06:15:42] <DrMax> My guess was Euler
[06:15:47] <DrMax> because... you know, Euler.
[06:15:54] <newpy> uh, what
[06:15:55] <PlanckWalk> Seems awfully late
[06:16:06] <newpy> he just said it was already known in 300BC
[06:16:07] <PlanckWalk> Considering people were doing it at least thousands of years ago.
[06:16:10] <newpy> how could it be Euler
[06:16:17] <PlanckWalk> newpy: "of the works historians know about"
[06:16:24] <DrMax> some things took their sweet time to devlop
[06:16:33] <PlanckWalk> No, nothing needed to develop.
[06:17:00] <PlanckWalk> What you're asking about is just "who explicitly putit into print and that work survives to this day and we know about it"
[06:17:00] <DrMax> newpy : I'm not talking about the idea of gcd (that predates Euclid, maybe by centuries)
[06:17:22] <PlanckWalk> Euclidean division was certainly known in Euclid's time.
[06:17:40] <DrMax> In the Elements (book VII) the procedure is explicitly presented as a lolfest of substractions
[06:17:43] <PlanckWalk> In terms of division, not just repeated subtraction.
[06:18:15] <PlanckWalk> Of course, for exactly the same reason that Peano presented a system in terms of successor operations: it's very easy to prove things about, and works.
[06:18:59] <PlanckWalk> Algorithms for more direct division were already long established in Euclid's time.
[06:19:00] <somiaj> and which form of division are you using? Would long division not be acceptable because it uses sucessive subtractions?
[06:19:25] <DrMax> no no no that's still not what I'm asking about
[06:20:00] <DrMax> at some point, someone realised explicitly that the successive subtractions in Book VII to find the GCD could be replaced with the remained only
[06:20:10] <PlanckWalk> DrMax: *Euclid already knew*
[06:20:12] <DrMax> Who was that.
[06:20:30] <Galois> as everyone else is saying, that point was certainly at or before Euclid
[06:20:41] *** Joins: terencetao (~Shimon@bzq-84-108-229-161.cablep.bezeqint.net)
[06:20:51] <DrMax> Then why does Book VII describes the procedure as substracting the smallest from the largest until zero is reached?
[06:20:52] *** Joins: x_kuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru)
[06:21:00] <Galois> because Euclid didn't write down everything he knew
[06:21:04] <PlanckWalk> DrMax: That book is abotu *proofs*
[06:21:16] <PlanckWalk> Successive subtraction is easy to prove things about.
[06:21:34] <newpy> you're getting in the way of DrMax's hero worship
[06:21:41] <PlanckWalk> Proving things about more advanced division algorithms is harder (especially without place-value systems)
[06:22:09] <Galois> it's certain that ancient greeks knew about such schemes. You couldn't even get to the point of asking about Archimedes' cattle problem for example without it.
[06:22:30] <DrMax> For example, in some of his proofs, he *does* use explicit remainder.
[06:22:41] <DrMax> Galois : it wasn't solved in greek times, was it? :p
[06:22:44] <PlanckWalk> Euclid certainly did not carry out 6000+ operations when comuting 12631 divided by 2.
[06:22:47] <Galois> asking, not solving
[06:23:26] <DrMax> IIRC, the solution is absurdly large
[06:23:40] <Galois> that doesn't really affect what I was saying

[06:25:18] <DrMax> ok, then, let's say he knew. Then, wouldn't be long division still waaaay faster than successive subtractions?
[06:25:35] <DrMax> And why the procedure wasn't described as long division remainder?
[06:26:13] <DrMax> I don't care either way, I'm just trying to establish fact
[06:26:52] <DrMax> if he understood the algorithm as using (a mod b) as we do today, why explain it with sucessive subtraction?
[06:27:16] <Galois> for the same reason why cardano had eight different cases for solving the cubic equation
[06:27:34] <DrMax> Knuth cites Eudoxus as probable source (but in the reference he used, it's not what they say, they say it was know in pythagorean times)
[06:27:48] <PlanckWalk> DrMax: Because proving stuff for better algorithms is much harder to both do, and to explain.
[06:28:02] <DrMax> Granted
[06:28:20] <PlanckWalk> Euclid didn't need to do the much more complicated thing for the purposes of that book.
[06:28:31] <PlanckWalk> So why woudl he do it there?
[06:28:52] <Galois> this was before negative numbers and zero were invented
[06:29:39] <DrMax> they had a very restricted notion of number too
[06:30:12] <DrMax> commensurable vs incommensurable and all that
[06:30:16] <Galois> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Historical_development
[06:30:37] <Galois> > In the late 5th century, the Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata described the algorithm as the "pulverizer", perhaps because of its effectiveness in solving Diophantine equations.
[06:30:44] <Galois> so that guy definitely knew about how to do it properly
[06:31:08] <DrMax> and the Chinese used a variation on binary GCD
[06:31:37] <DrMax> (dividing by the largest common power of 2 then resorting to successive subtractions)
[06:31:41] <Galois> if you're asking who wrote it down first with algorithmic complexity proof, it appears to be: "the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits (base 10) of the smaller integer. This was proven by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, and marks the beginning of computational complexity theory."

[09:45:28] <b0nn> hrm, just asked this in #programming, but thought it might be better here
[09:45:32] <b0nn> hrm, Can anyone tell me what's more efficient, the Levenshtein distance calculated using tries, or the Dice coefficient?
[09:45:36] <b0nn> I guess efficient is both in terms of memory and CPU but a comparison showing the effects on each metric would be good
[09:46:41] <b0nn> I'm thinking from the point of view of a fuzzy word finder, that is, searching for (misspelled?) terms in a dictionary

[19:52:11] <gigo> Let a be a positive integer. Let p be a prime. Can we show that if p | a^2, then p^2 | a^2 without relying on prime factorization of a? From something more elementary like Euclid's lemma of thereoms like p | ab => p | a or p | b?
[19:52:37] <Galois> yes?

[19:56:51] <gigo> Galois: can you help me to prove this?
[19:56:55] <PlanckWalk> gigo: Have you considered a=b in that last statement?
[19:57:36] <Galois> don't listen to me, my advice is useless. Listen to PlanckWalk.
[19:58:02] <Galois> but my useless proof is: Goal ∀ p a, prime p → p｜a^2 → p^2｜a^2. Proof. move=> p a H. rewrite ? pow_2_r => /Euclid's_lemma => /(_ H) [[k ->] | [k ->]]; exists (k*k) => /=; by ring_simplify. Qed.
[19:58:23] <gigo> PlanckWalk: I did but not sure if this argument is airtight. p | aa => p | a or p | a. Does it really follow that p^2 | a^2 from it?
[19:58:42] <PlanckWalk> gigo: p^2 | a^2 follows pretty quickly from p|a
[19:58:49] <Galois> maybe try to prove (airtightedly) that if a|b and c|d then ac|bd
[19:58:57] <ChaiTRex> gigo: p | a or p | a => p | a
[19:59:53] <gigo> omg! you are all right. it is indeed trivial. i was overthinking this. yes, a|b and c|d => ac|bd. b = ma, d = nc. Thus bd = mnac. Thus ac | bd.
[20:00:02] <gigo> thanks for the help!
[20:01:03] <ChaiTRex> p | a => pm = a => (pm)^2 = a^2 => p^2m^2 = a^2 => p^2 | a^2
