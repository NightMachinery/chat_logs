[03:01:46] <adam12> I'd probably 2nd legacy rails code bases. 
[03:01:48] <ox1eef> i think it comes down to ruby being easy to pick up and widely popular at one stage, thanks to Rails. that brought a lot of new comers who frankly didnt know better, and wrote a lot of garbage code.
[03:01:59] <adam12> Tho isn't there a saying: the languages that people aren't complaining about are the ones nobody is using.
[03:03:10] <ox1eef> i also think DHH is the face of ruby for some, and he's a divivise character. truth is only God really knows.

[03:51:34] <apotheon> Why do I think the negativity about Ruby is primarily related to C, Java, and Python coders (in no particular order)?
[03:51:51] <apotheon> Meanwhile, I quite like both C and Ruby.
[03:52:06] <apotheon> Actually, it might be C++, not C.
[03:52:19] <ox1eef> i'm enjoying rust
[03:52:27] <ox1eef> started learning a few days ago
[03:52:32] <apotheon> cool
[03:52:41] <apotheon> What resources are you using to learn it?
[03:53:02] <mooff> apotheon: i was thinking that i initially had frustration with Ruby because i didn't understand it
[03:53:26] <mooff> whereas if you're used to say Java, you won't have as much difficulty understanding PHP, or vice versa
[03:53:31] <apotheon> I see.
[03:53:37] <apotheon> Yeah, that kinda makes sense.
[03:53:41] <ox1eef> i bought a book on kindle: O'Reilly, Programming Rust.
[03:53:53] <ox1eef> the other books i saw seem a bit outdated, from 2018
[03:53:57] <apotheon> ox1eef: I guess you'd say it's a good book, then.
[03:54:04] <apotheon> I'll make a note of that.
[03:54:09] <ox1eef> yeah, mostly so.
[03:57:23] <ox1eef> last night i started a fun project, implementing prototype-based inheritance in Ruby. pretty much done. more or a less a clone of Object.create() from JS.
[03:58:01] <mooff> ooh.
[03:58:20] <apotheon> About twenty years ago I created a prototype-based object system for Perl, using closures, because it was essentially the best way to organize my current project.
[03:58:29] <ox1eef> nice =)
[03:58:38] <apotheon> . . . but that was because Perl's OOP facilities were awful.
[03:59:12] <apotheon> Your thing seems like it'd be more fun.
[03:59:19] <ox1eef> i remember something like moose
[03:59:37] <ox1eef> it was a cpan thing, so it didnt seem like part of the language
[03:59:43] <apotheon> That didn't exist yet, as far as I recall -- it was probably a year or two away.
[04:00:21] <apotheon> If it did exist, it hadn't become popular enough for anyone to have mentioned it to me or where I might encounter it.
[04:00:46] <ox1eef> the source is here: https://github.com/0x1eef/proto.rb - i still need to fix the readme, and all that stuff, but its functional and specs you can check out
[04:06:59] <apotheon> Yeah, Moose hails from 2006.
[04:07:30] <apotheon> My Perl usage was dropping off precipitously around then, shortly after I got into Ruby.
[04:08:15] <apotheon> ox1eef: That looks like it does the thing!
[04:08:19] <ox1eef> perl was my first language
[04:10:14] <ox1eef> maybe it will rise again with perl6
[04:10:18] <apotheon> Perl was the first or second that I used while getting paid money.
[04:10:25] <apotheon> lemme see . . .
[04:10:31] <apotheon> hmm
[04:10:41] <apotheon> I don't recall whether Perl or PHP was first.
[04:10:48] <ox1eef> perl was first
[04:10:55] <ox1eef> oh sorry ha
[04:10:56] <apotheon> I learned several before that, though.
[04:10:58] <ox1eef> misundestood you
[04:11:19] <apotheon> Perl 6 changed its name because even the Perlists realized it wasn't Perl any longer.
[04:11:33] <ox1eef> what is it called now?
[04:11:52] <apotheon> Thanks to slow dev, bad licensing like the old Perl, and the dissociation with Perl, it seems doomed to irrelevance.
[04:11:57] <apotheon> It's called Raku.
[04:16:11] <ox1eef> cool
[04:16:20] <ox1eef> yeah i think it will be playing catch up
[04:17:06] <leah2> i think the license is it's least problem :p
[04:19:52] <apotheon> It looks like it was a released thing in 2015.
[04:20:43] <apotheon> leah2: Yeah, it has other issues.  The fact it uses a unique-ish copyleft license means that it won't be very attractive to people who want to interoperate with other things, though.
[04:20:47] *** Joins: roadie (~user@2a02:8108:5a40:1d87:599e:d3ad:56ca:658e)
[04:20:59] <apotheon> . . . which causes network effect problems.
[04:21:22] <ox1eef> it use to be that perl was in the base of *nix systems, and tooling would be written with it. iirc perl even uses or used it.
[04:21:42] <ox1eef> i meant, git uses or used it
[04:21:49] <apotheon> Yeah, Perl used to be everywhere.
[04:21:57] <leah2> a
[04:22:01] <leah2> a
[04:22:03] <leah2> gah
[04:22:22] <leah2> also i never heard the perl license being an issue, ymmv
[04:22:22] <apotheon> I think Perl lost some people not only to "Perl 6" development, but also to other languages because people were tired of waiting for "Perl 6".
[04:22:34] <ox1eef> i think osx saw the benefit in that, by packaging up python, ruby, etc
[04:22:50] <leah2> it's just a huge language with not really good implementation
[04:22:57] <apotheon> leah2: Back when Perl first caught on, having a quirky license was kinda "normal".
[04:23:35] <leah2> and noone but perl5'ers was interested anyway, is my impression
[04:23:47] <apotheon> yeah
[04:24:03] <apotheon> Outside of the Perl world, mostly people didn't want to touch anything with Perl in the name.
[04:24:32] <ox1eef> regardless of implementation, it is still a language of ideas that other languages took with them, including ruby, and it is also arguably the work of an eccentric genius.
[04:24:39] <apotheon> Dissociating it from Perl with the name change was too little, too late, and lost a lot of Perl 5 users.
[04:24:59] <leah2> ox1eef: sure, it's a work of art
[04:25:05] <apotheon> Yeah, Perl itself inspired a lot of stuff elsewhere in the programming world.
[04:25:40] <apotheon> I don't sharpen sticks to hunt my lunch any longer, though.
[04:25:52] <apotheon> Okay, that's probably an overly-harsh characterization.
[04:26:08] <apotheon> Ruby has really spoiled me, though.

[05:05:20] <ox1eef> cool +1. i also want to add, Object.create(nil, SomeMod) as well as a block.
[05:07:36] <ox1eef> to keep it close to JS, i think you should consider having a #prototype method, so.. obj.create(...).prototype.prototype.prototype etc should work. then, hasOwnProperty should have an equivalent as well.
[05:08:02] <ox1eef> delete(obj[foo]) should have an equivalent.

[05:14:24] <mooff> that Prototype#prototype might read ancestors.find { |m| m != self and m.is_a? Prototype }
[05:16:02] <ox1eef> could be, honestly i'm not sure. i think a linked list implementation is going to be what will work best, there's a few things which should work to be similar to JS. Object.create(nil) basically creates an openstruct-like object in my case.
[05:17:33] <mooff> ah, i see!

[14:49:33] <isene> jhass[m]: That works for scientific notation - e.g. 26054 => 0.26054e5, what I need is => 26.054e03 (the exponent always turns out to be a multiple of 3)
[14:50:16] <isene> I could write a whole thing on this myself, but wondered if there is some canned solution for this somewhere
[14:50:34] <jhass[m]> maybe as a gem
[14:50:52] <jhass[m]> floating point printing algo's are actually quite the science in themselves..

[14:55:56] <isene> Reason I need this is for my project "XRPN" - a new programming language (written in Ruby) that is a superset of the FOCAL/RPN language of the venrable HP-41 programmable calculator. It's similar to FORTH in that it is stack based. So far I have implemented the whole 250+ function set as well as a host of modern features (read/write files, read web pages, code injection/deletion for self-modifying
[14:55:57] <isene> programs, indirect addressing). It is also extensible like LISP in that any function can be upgraded while a program is running and new functions can be added on the fly. Github soon.

[23:35:15] <arosen> Hello I am looking at this line of code  resource["/release"].post({component => branch}.to_json)
[23:36:03] <arosen> .post({component => branch}.to_json is equivalent  to something like: {'component': component, 'branch': branch}  I am guessing ? 
[23:36:16] <arosen> I am not sure this type of syntax { => } 
[23:36:32] <adam12> arosen: It's a style of Hash creation
[23:36:56] <adam12> arosen: But your equivalent isn't accurate, because 'component' could be a method call that returns something. As is 'branch'
[23:37:17] <weaksauce> it's the original style of hash creation before the symbol shorthand
[23:37:21] <adam12> component = 'foo'; branch = 'bar'; {component => branch}.to_json # => {'foo': 'bar'}
[23:37:22] <weaksauce> where any object could be a key
