[02:05:14] <Sven_vB> hi :) I have an Ubuntu focal that has a high system load and reacts slowly to input, even though its CPUs are mostly idle, it has at least 200 MB free RAM, and iotop reports at most about 40 MB/s disk write, and about 15 MB/s disk read. what else should I check?

[02:08:41] <sarnold> 200 megs "free" isn't necessarily good nor bad; it's probably more useful to look at the output of free -h or free -g as a whole, and also look at the output of 'vmstat 1' for a little while
[02:09:07] <Sven_vB> will do, thanks!

[02:15:25] <sarnold> it depends what your system is doing

[02:16:16] <Sven_vB> dubiousness, "reacts slowly" as in, typing a key into a local terminal with a local shell can suddenly take about 5 seconds for a character to appear. after half a minute or so, it goes back to nearly instant feedback, then soon it becomes slow again.
[02:16:24] <dubiousness> And if the disk is very full you will start to see odd issues too.

[02:17:12] <sarnold> that behaviour sounds a lot like a system that's swapping way too much on a disk that's far too slow
[02:17:21] <Sven_vB> I don't use a swap
[02:17:24] <sarnold> fix that
[02:19:04] <Sven_vB> what benefit would I have from a swap, rather than more RAM? (or using less if you're saying I have too few free)
[02:20:27] <dubiousness> I don't necessarily agree fully with sarnold, as there are valid use cases for disabling swap, but there are certain applications which behave... weirdly, if there's no swap (Xonotic springs to mind)
[02:21:18] <dubiousness> Are you able to stop the heavy-write process Sven_vB?
[02:21:25] <Sven_vB> what kinds of "weirdly"?
[02:21:40] <Sven_vB> intuitively, writing RAM to a slow disk seems to only make stuff slowert

[02:23:18] <sarnold> Sven_vB: having enough swap space for the kernel to push data that isn't used very often is a fantastic way to get more performance out of a machine that isn't powerful enough for the task at hand

[02:35:42] <Sven_vB> I see now, sarnold's point about not using swap probably is the one about the kernel having to flush file buffers more often in order to reclaim RAM.
[02:36:17] <Sven_vB> so if I want to stay with no swap, I should probably utilize less RAM in average then.
[02:36:23] <sarnold> yeah, eg it might need to get rid of 'bash' in order to keep storing some graphics that your browser never cleaned up, etc
[02:36:28] <Sven_vB> (or put in more RAM total)
[02:36:48] <dubiousness> There's a lot to be said for setting up a small server, then picking something (like a web server) and twiddling it to see how far you can push it with limited resources. You'll learn a lot.
[02:36:50] <Sven_vB> that phenomenon would easily explain why it happened to apache.
[02:36:51] <sarnold> also very helpful :)
[02:38:23] <Sven_vB> the proper solution in my case would probably be to replace certain ancient CGIs with a proper event-based server instead.

[05:34:29] <sarnold> different devices and software support different bluetooth profiles -- not all devices support all profiles, pulseaudio supports some profiles but not all, the pipewire tool that's going to replace pulseaudio at some point in the future apparently supports more profiles, or more useful profiles, etc..
[05:35:05] <sarnold> you might get half-functoinality out of a device, eg get lower-resolution headphone audio but not headset, or not higher-resolution audio, etc

[08:44:09] <blahboybaz> yukiup: I have tor browser
[08:44:10] <yukiup> look up a custom firefox
[08:44:51] <yukiup> :/ idk
[08:45:08] <blahboybaz> It goes through a process of connecting to tor every time I fire it up but if I try to visit any .onion site it errors
[08:46:00] <yukiup> maybe the site is down?
[08:46:09] <yukiup> oh, any...
[08:46:38] <enigma9o7[m]> theres lotsa info your browser passes, including your time zone/etc
[08:47:08] <enigma9o7[m]> check out https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/ for some info on it
[08:48:27] <enigma9o7[m]> lotta times secure connections wont work if time is set wrong.... apt for example... android does it to me too, it wont connect ot the wifi if the time is set wrong, bu tit cant update the time automatically unless it connects.

[19:41:04] <leftyfb> correct. Though you do have DROP as default, so it might not be needed. I've never done it that way but I probably should :)
[19:41:43] <leftyfb> webchat68: these are all things you can easily test
[19:42:58] <webchat68> Why the heck the default iptables is massive?
[19:43:05] <webchat68> And looks like a lot more globbed
[19:43:10] <leftyfb> webchat68: uh, looking at your rules, you have default to DROP, but then you add tcp and udp rules to open it all back up .... why?
[19:43:52] <leftyfb> well, you open up ESTABLISHED
[19:44:01] <webchat68> leftyfb I'm just following the CIS recommendations. I can refer the PDF file if it is allowed to paste URLs here
[19:44:24] <leftyfb> webchat68: I think you need to reach out to them for clarification. Or try #security
[19:44:59] <webchat68> leftyfb The setup is for this: Ensure iptables loopback traffic is configured, outbound and established connections are configured, and default deny firewall policy.
[19:45:19] <leftyfb> technically opening up ESTABLISHED shouldn't do anything, especially on a reboot. But I see no reason for them if you don't have any rules for NEW
[19:46:30] <leftyfb> I'm not expert on this though. I could be missing the reasoning
[19:46:40] <webchat68> leftyfb rationale from the paper: "If rules are not in place for new outbound, and established connections all packets will be dropped by the default policy preventing network usage."
[19:47:39] <leftyfb> webchat68: outbound I get. And yes, blocking all inbound network usage is the whole point, is it not?

[20:22:37] <BASHitup> It won't work
[20:22:38] <oerheks> BASHitup, give an example where sudo -i is *not* correct?
[20:22:38] <leftyfb> the root account is always created in ubuntu. The password is just disabled
[20:22:42] <enigma9o7[m]> but you really have no need to do that

[20:22:54] <enigma9o7[m]> But yeah, sudo -i is best.
[20:23:08] <BASHitup> The effect is the same but if you corrupt your file system, you can't always fix it as the default user
[20:23:21] <BASHitup> Actually, sudo -s is best but it's not worth an argument

[20:25:34] <leftyfb> BASHitup: what is you ubuntu support question exactly? So far you have only mentioned some poor decisions and falsehoods
[20:25:58] <oerheks> i think you ran random commands as root, no way of telling what happened.
[20:26:00] <BASHitup> su is an older but more fully-featured command included in all Linux distributions. It is the traditional way to switch to the root account.
[20:26:01] <BASHitup> Linux discourages working as root as it may cause unwanted system-wide changes and suggests using sudo instead. For this reason, all Ubuntu-based releases are sudo-only, meaning the root account is not active by default.
[20:26:01] <EriC^^> BASHitup: sudo -i is better in general than -s, as $HOME and other environment variables aren't set with -s, potential for problems especially if one runs anything related to $HOME configs like a gui program
[20:26:03] <BASHitup> While installing an Ubuntu OS, you create a user automatically labeled as part of the sudoers group. However, there is no root account setup. To enable the root user, you need to activate it manually.
[20:26:05] <BASHitup> On the other hand, other Linux distributions, such as Fedora, create a root and user account upon y
[20:26:07] <BASHitup> yy
[20:26:17] <EriC^^> just fyi, not trying to argue

[20:27:01] <BASHitup> like so there's sudo mv -r or sudo cp -r

[20:31:09] <leftyfb> BASHitup: you are right on both accounts. mods don't want to here non-support topics in the support channel. That's what -offtopic and -discuss are for. And yes, I agree, I think many people would benefit from a discussion about root. Those discussions should take place in -offtopic or -discuss
[20:34:19] <BASHitup> K, so to settle this so I don't annoy the mods - and the users. How are system commands that obliterate systems, which require support, not falling into support topics.
[20:34:27] <BASHitup> So this doesn't keep happening and I cna go with the flow
[20:35:10] <oerheks> yes, reinstall and use sudo -i
[20:35:15] <BASHitup> I spent 5 hours restoring from a clone. At one point, I needed support

[20:37:28] <BASHitup> Introduction
[20:37:30] <BASHitup> The sudo and su commands belong to the group of commands every Linux user comes across. Because they are similar in syntax and have overlapping functions, many new users are unsure when to use one over the other.
[20:37:32] <BASHitup> In this tutorial, learn all about the difference between su and sudo.
[20:37:34] <BASHitup> The difference between sudo and su explained.

[20:38:24] <leftyfb> BASHitup: I want you to understand, sudo -i, sudo -s, sudo su and loggin directly in as root, all of them login as root. The only difference is what ENVARS you copy over to use in shell commands and scripting. You have the exact same permissions with all of them

[20:38:38] <BASHitup> sudo [command]
[20:38:40] <BASHitup> Before the system executes the command, it asks for the password of the current user.
[20:38:42] <BASHitup> Bear in mind that the sudo option can only be used by users who belong to the sudoers group.

[20:38:45] <leftyfb> stop
[20:38:46] <BASHitup> For a user to execute a command that requires the sudo prefix, it has to be part of the sudoers group.
[20:38:48] <BASHitup> To add a user to the sudoers group, run the following command (as root or an account that already has sudo privileges):

[23:53:56] <Gallomimia> i'm just more or less concerned about whether a kernel update is going to touch headers or ways that the GPU drivers interact with it, causing perhaps a system hang when running a game

[23:57:45] <enigma9o7[m]> Gallomimia, if a new kernel causes you issues, you can select the old one from grub menu and boot into it, and remove the new one.
[23:57:47] <enigma9o7[m]> So, easy answer is, just try.
