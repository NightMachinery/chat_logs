[04:55:13] <Joanna> jan6: itâ€™s only a matter of time before all people have remote kill switches:)
[04:55:38] <jan6> not really
[04:56:04] <jan6> well, not involountarily
[04:56:11] <jan6> not in our lifetimes
[04:57:57] <Joanna> I can see the trajectory
[04:58:15] <jan6> well, the trajectory has always been there
[04:58:41] <Joanna> Remote kill switches used to be for people who wanted to stop car thieves
[04:58:49] <jan6> but there's no law requiring a backdoor in all electronic devices
[04:58:54] <jan6> etc
[04:59:31] <Joanna> If they cared about public safety cars wouldnâ€™t have been forced on everyone
[04:59:36] <jan6> I'm pretty sure that this thing being mandatory for car companies, does not mean it's illegal to remove
[04:59:58] <jan6> cars are NOT forced on everyone, anywhere outside USA, and in there, it's just a feedback loop
[05:00:21] <jan6> if you already need cars to go most places, then you're gonna prioritize car traffic, which means there's more reasons to use cars
[05:00:34] <Joanna> Good luck getting anywhere without a car in many places
[05:00:43] <jan6> in usa, yes
[05:00:51] <jan6> in most other places, not as bad
[05:01:16] <jan6> over here's small enough and nice enough that you can walk literally everywhere
[05:01:36] <Joanna> Actually the automobile interests literally bought and destroyed all the street car lines
[05:01:55] <jan6> "destroyed street car lines"?
[05:02:10] <Joanna> Yes
[05:02:15] <jan6> wdym
[05:03:03] <Joanna> Fired the employees ripped up the tracks , sent the rail cars to be smelted
[05:03:30] <Joanna> And replaced them with slow smelly buses
[05:03:37] <jan6> you didn't say rail, anywhere
[05:03:52] <jan6> you said "street car" which is confusing, since what cars are NOT street cars?
[05:04:12] <Joanna> Street cars were on rails
[05:04:50] <jan6> aaaah, trolleys
[05:05:01] <jan6> trams
[05:07:50] <Joanna> Yes
[05:08:21] <Joanna> They did a good job of destroying most passenger trains also
[05:08:35] <jan6> totally a thing still, here, but it's understandable, as that's one less lane for cars
[05:08:51] <jan6> also trains are slowly dying out
[05:08:54] <jan6> very sadly
[05:09:09] <jan6> just because there's not enough people using them, generally
[05:09:13] <Joanna> Dying out? I wonder how that happed
[05:09:46] <Joanna> Yea because your leaders are corrupt and subsidizing roads for cars probably
[05:10:25] <Joanna> Thatâ€™s how they do it
[05:10:39] <jan6> of course not
[05:10:42] <jan6> the roads are in disrepair
[05:10:45] <jan6> lol
[05:11:02] <jan6> well, minor disrepair, driveable but with holes and stuff
[05:11:25] <Joanna> Why did people stop using trains ? Did they get cars by any chance ?
[05:12:14] <jan6> if you've got buses and trains and option of using your own car, then 1) buses are not that great experience, are scheduled, etc, 2) trains are even more sparsely scheduled, and you're gonna need to walk a considerable distance from/to the station, 3) car goes wherever you want, whenever you want, doesn't stop to let anyone else off, and if you're in a super hurry, you can speed up at your own risk
[05:12:30] <jan6> so pretty obvious why people would not use 1) or 2)
[05:12:58] <jan6> trains are BY FAR the most comfortable transport mechanism, imho
[05:13:37] <Joanna> If people didnâ€™t have cars there would be better trains . The first thing the saboteurs did to street cars was reduced the service
[05:13:40] <jan6> trams/trolleys aren't too bad either, but of limited use for me, as I'd rather just walk, anyway (unless in a hurry)
[05:13:59] <jan6> not neccesarily, Joanna 
[05:14:08] <jan6> you're forgetting that the e-scooters are all the rage nowdays
[05:14:13] <jan6> e-bikes too
[05:14:31] <jan6> well
[05:14:38] <jan6> scooters don't work for long distance, sure
[05:15:14] <jan6> but there are some cities, where bikes are the majority's main transport method (although very very few of such places, overall)
[05:15:29] <Joanna> About the kill switch on cars you mentioned earlier. The cars will probably have full surveillance in them and record everything that happens with them
[05:16:00] <jan6> obviously not
[05:16:19] <jan6> you're forgetting the law of capitalism
[05:16:31] <jan6> do as little as possible, get as much profit as possible
[05:16:38] <Joanna> Look where it has gotten us so far
[05:16:54] <jan6> they will not do extra surveillance that doesn't profit them
[05:17:00] <Joanna> Surveillance capitalism
[05:17:00] <jan6> because that's wasted effort
[05:17:17] <jan6> your phone is WAY better at that than your car
[05:17:20] <Joanna> Oh it will profit alright
[05:17:39] <jan6> the car company won't get ANYTHING of value your phone doesn't, already
[05:18:28] <jan6> and the limited amount of people who don't carry a smartphone with them, is neglegible
[05:18:46] <Joanna> It can know everything that happens with car and record all your conversations and voiceprint the participants
[05:18:57] <jan6> so can your phone, already
[05:19:02] <jan6> but nobody's doing that
[05:19:08] <Joanna> Why not both
[05:19:19] <jan6> but there is neither
[05:20:03] <Joanna> Itâ€™s already been done but it was voluntary feature for emergencies
[05:21:16] <jan6> also I wouldn't be surprised if all you needed to disable that monitoring ended up being that you need to send a specific command through the CAN bus
[05:21:24] <Joanna> Many years ago I made jokes about them taxing orgasms if they could I wonder how long it will take them to implement that...
[05:21:44] <jan6> it will never happen
[05:21:52] <jan6> because that's nothing of interest to them
[05:22:08] <jan6> the only people who would care, would be dating apps and porn studios
[05:22:16] <Joanna> You would be surprised what interests them
[05:22:23] <jan6> not really
[05:24:10] <Joanna> I made a joke about what will they want next ? Naked pictures and that prediction came true. In 2019 I made a joke what will they do next require Iâ€™d to leave your house and that one is currently happening
[05:25:25] <Joanna> My cynical jokes seem to have a bad habit of happening. Maybe Iâ€™m at fault for this mess.
[05:40:08] <jan6> good thing that I'm not anywhere where news of such actions reach
[05:40:23] <jan6> since nothing like that's going on afaik
[05:40:45] * jan6 slep
[05:41:15] <jan6> but feel free to link resources about all of your jokes coming true
[05:41:55] <jan6> tom scott predicted a lot worse future than happened, for 2022, in 2012, too
[05:45:17] <jan6> things generally work out one way or another, to the point where everyone can accept their lives as acceptable, even if not good, e.g. got injected with a nanotech system? there's probably someone out there who can remove it from the rebels who hate that, get spied on through smartphones? DIY your own phone, and hold it in a faraday cage when not expecting calls, etc
[05:46:47] <jan6> no more landline phones? you can always have a stationary cellular phone from which you've desoldered all microphones and put in a soundproof box, and use external handset with
[05:46:51] <jan6> etc etc
[05:47:04] <jan6> where there's a will, there's a way
[05:48:15] <jan6> it's just a race of time, whether spying will be default and normalized, or privacy advocates manage to sway enough people to not have that happen
[05:48:43] <jan6> and even if it does, there'll always be rebels sabotaging the system, like that recent npm package stuff
[05:49:39] <jan6> apparently he got locked out of his entire github account because of that, too, where all he did was short-circuit his OWN package, which happened to be pretty popular, lol
[05:53:34] * jan6 slep again
[06:22:05] <Joanna> jan6: the naked pictures thing is body scanners at airports
[06:25:26] <Joanna> All this trend with people tolerating infringement upon their rights leads to them losing all their property being eliminated if history serves as a reference.

[17:11:47] <joe7057> I can sort of understand the principle behind it though. 
[17:12:43] <joe7057> @Joanna Also does anyone know which license he was using? I believe some of them do allow the creator to withdraw permission to modify it.
[17:46:41] <jan6> any of them do
[17:47:21] <jan6> he just short-circuited it, so it printed garbage instead of doing the thing

[18:51:32] <joe7057> huh interesting. I am pretty sure that at least some of the licenses (some of the GPL ones) do not allow the creator to withdraw that permission, but rather only allows them to simply stop publishing updates themselves.
[18:57:31] <joe7057> I'm not unsympathetic to his complaint though. There are hundreds if not thousands of companies using his software, and it would be utterly trivial for them to throw 100 dollars a month to him each. Even if just the top 100 gave this, that would be 10000 dollars a month, which is a perfectly respectable salary. Especially since he can work from literally anywhere, so he could move somewhere with
[18:57:33] <joe7057> extremely low cost of living if he wanted.
[18:58:05] <joe7057> I think that there really needs to be an understanding that companies should pay for software they use, even if it is libre software.
[18:59:08] <joe7057> It would still be quite cheap compared to hiring someone to develop such a piece fo software themselves.

[19:31:50] *** Quits: Joanna (uid57472@id-57472.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[19:33:24] <JimBuntu> I wonder what impacts this will have compared to normal staffing changes.  They are still humans and sometimes you run into trash humans... I wonder how management is handled, if different.
[19:41:05] <joe7057> There will already have been protocols in place for this eventuality, though more likely focused towards some sort of mass casualty event, so I assume they will follow those protocols
[19:43:36] <JimBuntu> That's the thing though, I presume those protocols would give control to the military vs. simply using them as workers.  idk though
[19:44:57] <JimBuntu> Probably some happy middle ground between that and national guard policies will be used.
[19:46:55] <jan6> joe7057: pretty sure that he also got inspired by the log4j drama, since like, that was THE "thanklessy maintained by one person in nebraska" pillar everyone built their stuff on top, without ever donating anything
[19:48:07] <joe7057> JimBuntu I assume they will apply whichever one of the variations makes sense in this case. Remember that the government employs a bunch of people with the sole job of thinking about possible emergencies, and coming up with effective and legal methods for dealing with them. 
[19:48:33] <joe7057> jan6: certainly possible. That sure was a big kerfuffle.
