[00:00:21] <adam12> Be nice if we could settle on an API like Rack, but for HTTP requests.
[00:00:26] <havenwood> mmmmm
[00:00:54] <adam12> then it could be Square.build(my_own_http_client) and you could just my_own_http_client.get(path, headers, body) or whatever.
[00:01:19] <adam12> Any large project seems to have 4-5 HTTP clients (transitively)
[00:07:55] <adam12> My largest project has async-http, httparty, excon, faraday, and patron, with only Faraday being non-transitive.

[00:26:03] <havenwood> adam12: Yeah, async-http, HTTP.rb and Typhoeus are my gotos.
[00:26:21] <havenwood> adam12: I did use Faraday for our Ruby SDK since that seemed the most flexible to not mess with your world.
[00:26:41] <havenwood> A Rack-like solution would sure be nice. The problem with Faraday is we'd all have to actually use it.
[00:26:49] <havenwood> I guess Faraday is the closest we have.
[00:33:07] <adam12> I wonder what it would take to make net/http nicer to use.
[00:33:28] <adam12> I submitted a PR months ago without a peep, so I don't know whether it would even see any improvements outside of something that tickled core's fancy.

[10:50:07] <ox1eef> mooff: i saw your comment, thanks. ive become sort of stuck when it comes to specific decisions, like should object.class = 'bar' work? it works in openstruct, but also makes it error out in cases where 'class' is used. i think JS allows it and by magic of its implementation avoids errors in its internals. 
[10:51:12] <ox1eef> its much easier to follow JS as close as possible, and avoiding thinking of those kind of decisions altogether.

[16:20:19] <henk> ox1eef: would you recommend it over others?
[16:28:44] <ox1eef> i haven't used it in quite some time, and the version i was using is quite old. the old versions had some quirks i believe older major versions addressed.

[16:30:19] <mooff> Slop looks nice. i've not used it, but hope to
[16:31:12] <mooff> for a shareable script i'd want to rely on the stdlib. for that case there's OptionParser and GetoptLong
[16:32:30] <mooff> ox1eef: i guess it depends whether you want it to be more BasicObject than Object-like, as a Ruby user of it
[16:32:54] <ox1eef> right now you can do: Object.create(nil, superclass: BasicObject)
[16:33:26] <ox1eef> ive been tinkering with it a bit, ive added Proto::Object and made the Object.create monkeypatch opt-in by require of core_ext/object
[16:33:55] <mooff> cool

[16:47:36] <ox1eef> indeed
[16:48:24] <mooff> if you hope to leave the choice up to the user, maybe it's possible to avoid defining #class and #singleton_class

[21:10:16] <chirukodati> Hi, https://github.com/kratos6753/leftpad/runs/5774888559?check_suite_focus=true >> can someone, help me with why github action failed while setting up ruby - 3.1.1 ?
[21:10:47] <adam12> chirukodati: bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
[21:10:58] <adam12> chirukodati: then commit and push
[21:10:59] <isene> It would be cool if anyone in here could check out XRPN; https://github.com/isene/xrpn
[21:11:59] <isene> XRPN is a new programming language written in Ruby. It is stack-based, similar to Forth, Raven and Postscript. It is a superset of the HP-41 programming language, FOCAL.
[21:12:15] <chirukodati> M1 mac problems :(

[21:13:28] <adam12> chirukodati: lol yep.
[21:19:42] <isene> adam12: I'm at something like 50 hours so far, wondering what to add next to the language. I'm hoping it will keep me busy for quite some time. But to achieve that, I could do with some feedback.
[21:20:47] <chirukodati> Thanks adam12. It worked.
[21:20:57] <adam12> chirukodati: cheers.
[21:21:28] <apotheon> adam12: Is your username from a TV series?
[21:22:01] <adam12> apotheon: Yea :)
[21:22:28] <apotheon> I've been wondering that for a while.
[21:22:31] <apotheon> a long while
[21:22:36] <adam12> LOL
[21:22:46] <apotheon> I just finally decided I was curious enough to ask.
[21:23:11] <apotheon> I think I saw a grand total of about ten minutes of it once.
[21:23:25] <adam12> I picked it a 100 years ago and it's stuck, tho I wish the show was Adam65535 because on some sites, adam12 is already taken due to the incremental nature of it.
[21:23:53] <adam12> Yeah, it's a very old show.
[21:24:21] <apotheon> yep
[21:25:08] <apotheon> I'm a very old person.
[21:25:24] <adam12> Likewise O_O

[21:26:08] <apotheon> You *might* be older than me, given your enthusiasm for Adam-12.
[21:26:21] <apotheon> I think something like three episodes aired since my birth.
[21:26:49] <adam12> I'd bet we're the same age.
[21:27:09] <adam12> It's just naming things is hard, and a 100 years ago I picked a name that stuck due to a passing familiarity to a show.
[21:27:26] <apotheon> gotcha
[21:28:20] <mooff> so you're saying apotheon is more than a hundred years old?!
[21:28:24] <mooff> also very nice ox1eef 
[21:29:45] <apotheon> mooff: contemporary of folks like Lao Tzu and Diogenes

[21:43:57] <adam12> One interesting (to me anyway) thing about building gemdocs.org is that I see some new interesting gems I'm not sure I'd ever discovered by hand. But also very strange (to me anyway) deployment processes. Such as this one gem that I just saw push 20+ pre-releases in the span of a few minutes, and it's up to pre.1093 as a version number?

[21:46:31] <adam12> I'm tempted to add the ability to generate gems on-demand; visit /gems/foobar/1.2.3 and it will build it if it doesn't already have it.

[22:37:25] <Guest26nakilon> and about the "short answer interface", not sure what is the official API but maybe it's a shortcut to limiting the response to just the "primary" pod, but that pod isn't always the best one, and sometimes is absent, and sometimes there are several of them so it's all incosistent and had to be handled in my code
