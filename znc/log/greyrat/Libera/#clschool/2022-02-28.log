[13:01:55] <lisp123> The purpose of imposing a particular style is based on a few simple facts that hold true for both natural languages and programming languages:
[13:01:55] <lisp123> • The set of all idiomatic phrases is a tiny subset of the set of all grammat- ical phrases.
[13:01:55] <lisp123> • The main purpose of these phrases is to serve as communication between people.
[13:01:57] <lisp123> To illustrate the first fact, consider a natural language such as English. In English, we say “tooth brush”, but “dental floss”. The words dental brush and tooth floss would be perfectly grammatical, but they are not used. A person trying to communicate with other people must use the words that have been widely agreed upon, even though some other words are perfectly legitimate.
[13:02:24] <lisp123> One of my favourite recent paragraphs on CL / programming, reposting for #CLSCHOOL
[13:10:37] <pjb> lisp123: more or less. The problem is that tooth floss means something in CL, but it may not have meaning associated with anything in natural languages.
[13:11:08] <lisp123> pjb: That's true
[13:11:44] <pjb> lisp123: the difference is that the vocabulary in natural languages is very large, so we need this prior mapping, while the vocabulary in programming language is small and the mapping is pre-defined.
[13:13:30] <pjb> In a way, all natural languages are like Tamarians.
[13:13:38] <lisp123> Good point. I think you mentioned it earlier (maybe in another context), on the preciseness of programming languages
[13:13:39] <pjb> s/s\././
[13:14:03] <pjb> (and "this is not a pipe").
[13:14:40] <lisp123> Now i want to watch more Star Trek
[13:15:47] <beach> lisp123: Sounds like something I wrote.
[13:16:07] <lisp123> beach: It does, doesn't it
[13:16:46] <beach> But I don't think I wrote in in the IRC channel, so where did you see it?
[13:18:11] <lisp123> Second Climacs PDF
[13:18:25] <beach> Makes sense.
[13:18:37] <lisp123> I was looking for the cluffer PDF (which I had read before), but then stumbled upon that
[13:19:23] <beach> The point I am making is often not recognized by inexperienced programmers (even those with a long history of working in the domain, but who for some reason haven't bother getting experienced).
[13:19:42] <beach> They confuse semantics and idioms. 
[13:20:44] <lisp123> I see
[13:20:56] <beach> And while the number of grammatical phrases in a programming language is smaller than in a typical natural language, there are still way more grammatical phrases than idiomatic phrases in a programming language. 
[13:21:43] <beach> "Whaddayamean?  WHEN returns NIL by default so I can use it in a context of the value being needed!"
[13:22:41] <beach> "Whaddayamean?  OR can take a generalized Boolean, so I can give it the value of STREAM!"
[13:22:45] *** Joins: treflip (~user@user/treflip)
[13:22:52] <beach> Stuff like that.
[13:23:20] <lisp123> However, to play devil's advocate, the latter one seems popular at times
[13:23:43] <lisp123> I saw Martin Simmons at LispWorks using it frequently in their code
[13:24:41] <beach> It is funny how the same person can complain about non-idiomatic language in English, whether it is "popular" or not, but then go right ahead and use non-idiomatic phrases in their favorite programming language. 
[13:25:34] <beach> The argument usually boils down to "But *I* prefer...", so completely ignoring the communication aspect.
[13:26:07] <beach> So maybe *I* prefer "dental brush" and I don't care what others think.
[13:27:33] <pjb> Each one is also actor and creator of the usage.    If more people had random orthogonal usages, then people wouldn't expect strongly idiomatic languages.
[13:28:35] <pjb> Social conformity breads social conformity.  Less social conformity is good, since it makes people expect less social conformity; it frees everybody, and at least, makes every body expect anything.
[13:29:16] <pjb> So I would even argue more strongly against idiomatic expression, and engage you to use dental bruth and tooth floss too.
[13:29:22] <beach> It is true of both natural languages and programming languages that each user can create new idioms, but for that to happen, the person needs to have a lot of authority, and there are few such people.
[13:29:49] <beach> Of course you would.
[13:30:26] <pjb> beach: authority is not even needed.  I've noticed the use of some words in certain context spreading from myself to the general public quite quickly, just from social networks.
[13:30:38] <pjb> beach: the rule of the 6 nodes apart…

[22:11:12] <ilmu> but both stdin and stdout are in use so are there any streams available for the user to interact with?
[22:11:20] <ilmu> do I need a tui library?
[22:18:20] <White_Flame> you can use SLIME
[22:18:27] <White_Flame> if they're all listening on different ports

[22:33:19] <pjb> ilmu: the kernel gives you file descriptors and pipes.
[22:33:32] <pjb> ilmu: the shell gives you stdin, stdout, stderr and redirections.
[22:34:23] <pjb> ilmu: what you want, is a new shell, that gives you stdin/stdout for pipes, and some other file descriptor for user interaction.  You will also want to multiplex user interaction between each process of the pipelines.
[22:35:52] <pjb> ilmu: so your shell will fork the commands, by first opening their file descriptors 3 and 4 to pipes to the user interaction multiplexer process (perhaps the shell itself), and the file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 to the stdin, stdout and stderr pipes or redirections.
[22:36:31] <pjb> ilmu: of course, the commands will have to deal with the file descriptors 3 and 4 (eg. hook them to *terminal-io* and *query-io*)
