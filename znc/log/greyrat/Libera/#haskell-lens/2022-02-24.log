[23:39:34] <Zemyla> There should be a way to use Cons to define a Natural as a list of digits.
[23:40:44] <Zemyla> It'd have to be parameterized by the base, though.
[23:41:24] <dminuoso> Zemyla: That seems impossible given the types involved.
[23:41:33] <Zemyla> Why so?
[23:41:52] <dminuoso> Let's assume `instance Cons Natural Natural Char Char` for now
[23:42:12] <dminuoso> Ah hold on, I was thinking NonEmpty in my mind
[23:42:16] <dminuoso> No all is good
[23:42:53] <Zemyla> No, it'd be more like instance KnownNat n => Cons (Base n) (Base n) (Mod n) (Mod n), where Base n is Natural and Mod n is Natural restricted between [0, n).
[23:42:59] <dminuoso> Zemyla: I guess Id have a sore taste in my mouth for assuming a fixed base.
[23:43:30] <Zemyla> If you were to assume a fixed base, it'd be 2, and it'd be Cons Natural Natural Bool Bool.
[23:43:57] <Zemyla> Interestingly, it is a Cons but not a Snoc.
[23:44:26] <Zemyla> Actually, no, it's not a Cons, because cons 0 0 = 0.
[23:44:44] <Zemyla> So never mind.
[23:44:58] <dminuoso> Mmm
[23:45:22] <dminuoso> A shame indeed
[23:46:07] <Zemyla> Anyways, what do you think of having zipTraversal in lens?
