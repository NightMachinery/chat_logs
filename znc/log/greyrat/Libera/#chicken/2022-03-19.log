[14:17:47] <ymherklotz> Hi, quite new to chicken now, but I've been using `csi -ss` to run my script which has a `main` function.
[14:18:25] <ymherklotz> However, when I compile it, it generates a binary that doesn't run this `main` function by default, which makes sense to .
[14:18:34] <ymherklotz> me*
[14:19:17] <ymherklotz> I was wondering whether it would be possible to do that though, and get the compiled binary to automatically call the main function with (command-line-arguments).

[16:42:23] <wasamasa> mario-goulart: indeed, but you can still point to whatever the latest release of an egg points to
[16:42:34] <wasamasa> mario-goulart: and that information could be automatically included for an egg wiki page
[16:42:42] <Bunny351> ymherklotz: you can pass the -epilogue option to add some code when compiling
[16:44:39] <ymherklotz> Bunny351: Oh thanks so much, that's perfect.

[18:50:34] <nulluint> I have company-mode working with guile in geiser-mode for scheme, but if I set the implementation to scheme it doesn't work
[18:50:51] <wasamasa> have you installed all the prerequisite eggs?

[19:13:21] <nulluint> what should my chicken doc point to? https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/.emacs.d/tree/master/item/lisp/programming/scheme.el
[19:13:38] <nulluint> just the chicken-doc folder?
[19:15:09] <wasamasa> it should point to a directory containing id.idx, lock and root/
[19:15:55] <wasamasa> .../share/chicken/doc points to the documentation of the scheme system, not the chicken-doc files
[19:16:06] <wasamasa> as opposed to .../share/chicken/chicken-doc
[19:19:03] <nulluint> okay, I am pointing it there
[19:19:14] <nulluint> manI wish I knew what I could do to get company and chicken to work
[19:19:48] <wasamasa> I pretty much gave up on geiser for that, not really worth it
[19:20:00] <wasamasa> it's been a while since I looked into it though
[19:20:22] <nulluint> also I am trying flymake-chicken, and it is not working at all with any errors
[19:21:15] <wasamasa> I could probably help with debugging that
[19:21:51] <nulluint> online I found people having a chicken-flymake with the following:
[19:21:55] <nulluint> csc -SAv "$@" || true
[19:22:05] <nulluint> but -S is not supported, so I changed it to
[19:22:06] <nulluint> csc -sAv "$@" || true
[19:22:54] <wasamasa> uh
[19:23:00] <wasamasa> what is -S even supposed to do?
[19:23:04] <nulluint> no idea
[19:23:16] <wasamasa> it's not a thing in the C4 and C5 manuals
[19:23:33] <wasamasa> and -s is wrong for programs
[19:23:39] <nulluint>  Generate dynamically loadable shared object file.
[19:23:45] <nulluint> -s
[19:24:04] <wasamasa> yeah, but if you don't know what -S is supposed to do, you cannot just blindly hope -s is the thing to use
[19:24:26] <nulluint> https://github.com/spurious/chicken-core-mirror/blob/master/scripts/chicken-flymake
[19:24:34] <nulluint> good point
[19:26:31] <wasamasa> ok, so I've looked at the source code of the 4.8.0 release and it's the shorthand for the -scrutinize option
[19:27:04] <wasamasa> which has been removed in the 5.0.0 release
[19:27:09] <wasamasa> presumably because it's always enabled
[19:27:57] <wasamasa> so I'd change the invocation to -Av
[19:28:22] <nulluint> okay, did that, still does not work
[19:28:38] <wasamasa> what's the point of the pipe?
[19:29:48] <nulluint> I have no idea
[19:29:53] <wasamasa> I suspect that the script broke as of the flymake rewrite
[19:30:15] <wasamasa> because the customized variables flymake-allowed-file-name-masks and flymake-err-line-patterns do not exist
[19:31:01] <wasamasa> or no
[19:31:09] <wasamasa> it exists as an obsolete alias in flymake-proc.el, lol
[19:31:25] <wasamasa> introduced with emacs 26.1
[19:32:31] <nulluint> thank you so much for helping me
[19:53:08] <wasamasa> yeah, this definitely needs to be rewritten based on python.el or such
