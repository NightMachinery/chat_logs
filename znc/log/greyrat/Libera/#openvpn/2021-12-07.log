[18:48:27] <Aoyagi> Hi, how do I inline pem, crt, and key? It's for the iOS Connect client.
[18:54:21] <plaisthos> see the man page about inlining files
[18:56:24] <Aoyagi> If I knew where to look I wouldn't be asking here.
[19:00:33] <DArqueBishop> https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn24ManPage
[19:00:46] <DArqueBishop> Scroll down to where it says INLINE FILE SUPPORT.
[19:02:51] <Aoyagi> Thanks. I did find that earlier and I figured it only applies to .p12 files. So I take it it's not the case
[19:03:56] <DArqueBishop> Nope, I used inline crt/key files in there for Windows clients too.
[19:05:22] <Aoyagi> alright, I'll see if I can get that to work, cheers

[20:43:20] <Aoyagi> so I pasted the output of openssh and I'm getting parse_hex_error ... are those equal signs at the end supposed to be included?
[21:05:16] <DArqueBishop> ... OpenSSH?
[21:07:34] <Aoyagi> OpenSSL
[21:09:27] <DArqueBishop> But yes, EVERYTHING in the crt/key is supposed to be included.
[21:10:48] <Aoyagi> Right, everything is there, and this is what it does on a normal OVPN client, not iOS https://puu.sh/Iuzuz/a4609f5dc5.png
[21:13:07] <DArqueBishop> Right. So, to confirm, client and server have the same ca.crt files, and the cert/keys for both server and client are signed by the ca.crt's CA?
[21:14:39] <Aoyagi> Err, I'd assume so. I the "same" config only not with inline certs/keys works on PC.
[21:18:27] <Aoyagi> Just to clarify the whole situation, I don't do anything on the admin side (if that wasn't clear enough already lol). It's just that the admin refuses to cater to one of the needs of one very special employee who as the only one of 250 insists on using Apple products.
[21:20:11] <DArqueBishop> Okay, so... unless you're the "very special employee", why are you getting involved? :-)
[21:22:29] <Aoyagi> Well, techinically I'm user support and I'm somewhat willing. 
[21:23:07] <DArqueBishop> Let me give you a bit of advice. Ask the admin if he minds you doing that. :-)
[21:25:32] <Aoyagi> He does, but she's the manager and the CEO's daughter. The chosen one! I'll let him know if I manage to get it to work of course.
