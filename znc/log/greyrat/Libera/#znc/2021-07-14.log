[09:08:22] <Zorayas> Hi. Is anyone around? I'm trying to set up a znc server and it's going horribly wrong. I was hoping someone could help me, if I explained whast I was trying to get it to do.
[09:08:22] <ZNC-Linker> Pointless question detected! Zorayas, we are not telepaths, please ask a concrete question and wait for an answer. Be sure that you have checked https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ first. You may want to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html Sorry if this is a false alarm.
[09:11:01] <Zorayas> Okay, then. I want to configure my ZNC server to automatically connect to IRC servers and channels of my choice as me. Then, I want my laptop, cell phone, and desktop, to all connect to my ZNC server with the ability to send and receive messages as though I were connected to IRC on that device, the way I'm connected to ZNC. I also want it to display any text a given client "missed', i.e. was not in the server for. But
[09:11:01] <Zorayas>  everything's going wrong, and I'm having a huge panic attack, so I was hoping someone could please hold my hand through configuring my server.

[19:08:39] <MetaNova> there's nothing wrong with running ZNC as a regular system user
[19:09:03] <Casper> Except that if you give someone admin access on ZNC they can access the shell of that user.
[19:09:07] <MetaNova> the 'znc' user is typically just a system user with login set to /bin/false (or such)
[19:09:19] <MetaNova> Casper: yeah
[19:10:24] <drd> MetaNova: yeah it's the same setup on arch. It obviously doesn't make sense when you have a server with multiple users on it. But as a local service the are no problems.

[20:26:07] <tusko> I keep getting disconnected from Libera w/ route_replies messages when connecting ZNC=>Tor=>Libera but the same bouncer does not give any problems when connecting to OFTC
[20:32:01] *** Quits: knolle (~blah@user/knolle) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[20:37:24] <MetaNova> tusko: tor adds latency and a level of network instability due to the nature of the route
[20:37:47] <MetaNova> route_replies will complain if a command/expected output is not received (in time)
[20:38:18] <MetaNova> and there's nothing you can really do about it if tor and libera aren't behaving well together besides either
[20:38:22] <MetaNova> a) don't use tor, or
[20:38:32] <MetaNova> b) wait until a more reliable route is established
[20:41:22] <tusko> Ok, cool. Its been driving me crazy for a while now. Everything was fine until one day it wasn'ty

[20:47:50] <MetaNova> tusko: it might be worth stopping/killing the tor daemon, and then initializing it again
[20:48:10] <MetaNova> but I'm no tor expert so I'm unsure if this would have any meaningful impact
[20:48:24] <MetaNova> it's what I would try as an end user, though
[20:49:18] <tusko> I tried that on the bouncer host, perhaps I should also try it here.
[20:49:58] <tusko> MetaNova, I've had the issue where deleting tor deletes my /etc/torrc (or overwrites this) and the same with the systemd unit.
[20:50:11] <MetaNova> oh, no
[20:50:12] <MetaNova> no no no
[20:50:15] <tusko> Is there a speicifc place these customized files should be located?
[20:50:18] <MetaNova> I don't mean /uninstall/ tor
[20:50:28] <MetaNova> I meant like, sudo service tor stop ; sudo service tor start
[20:50:34] <tusko> oh
[20:50:44] <tusko> ok, that's much easier
[20:51:25] <MetaNova> oh
[20:51:26] <MetaNova> and
[20:51:28] <MetaNova> actually
[20:51:49] <MetaNova> now that I think about it, try increasing the timeout duration for the libera+tor network
[20:52:21] <MetaNova> libera has a network-side ping timeout of about 4 minutes, or ~=240 seconds
[20:52:33] <MetaNova> I think ZNC natively has .. 120? 180?
[20:52:38] <MetaNova> let me find the variable
[20:52:56] <MetaNova> ah yes

[20:53:04] *** Joins: redlob (~redlob@user/redlob)
[20:53:37] <MetaNova> mine is presently at 180. try setting yours to something greater than or equal to 240, so as to verify ZNC will not terminate the connection before the network does
[20:53:53] <MetaNova> /msg *controlpanel set NoTrafficTimeout $me 240
[20:54:10] <MetaNova> or 300, or whatever, so long as it is not lower than the network-defined connection timeout

[21:23:11] <kushal> MetaNova, I never knew about controlpanel, thank you.
[21:23:23] <MetaNova> no problem
[21:23:26] <kushal> so many available commands, will have to read through slowly.
[21:23:32] <MetaNova> yes
[21:24:00] <MetaNova> get/set is for user variables, getnetwork/setnetwork are for network variables, and getchan/setchan are for, as you may have guessed, channel variables
[21:24:20] *** Joins: QuantumWings (~QuantumWi@quantumwings.net)
[21:24:27] <MetaNova> (I'm mostly pointing out "get" and "set" are for user variables only, not any global variables, because controlpanel is a user module)
[21:24:46] <kushal> MetaNova, thank you for the tips. These are useful ones.
[21:25:23] <MetaNova> I'm very pleased to help. let me know if there is anything else you were wondering
