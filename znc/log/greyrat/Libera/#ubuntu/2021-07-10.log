[00:14:00] <Guest14> Hi y'all. I'm back from earlier (the guy who's trying to rescue some files). I found some discrepancy between df -h /home/$USER and the output of gddrescue. Is it because I used --sparse with ddrescue?
[00:14:06] <Guest14> If I run ls -lah from /home/$USER it says my sbd1.img from ddrescue is 466G, however, when I run df -h /home/$USER it returns "/dev/sda6 441G 187G 231G 45% /home"
[00:14:11] <Guest14> How is it possible for a 466G file to be in /home when /home is 441G?
[00:14:14] <oerheks> https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=N;O=D
[00:14:19] <Guest14> Or even worse, how come /home is only 45% used? lol
[00:14:28] <Guest14> Once again, is it because of the sparse file deal? How do I know its true size?
[00:14:28] <oerheks> thismachine, ^
[00:14:31] <tomreyn> thismachine: https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v5.13/ says "To obtain the source from which they are built fetch the commit below: git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel-test/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/mainline-crack cod/mainline/v5.13"
[00:14:55] <oerheks> Guest14, you had a faulty disk, wasn't it?
[00:15:07] <oerheks> so discrepancy would be expected..
[00:15:15] <Guest14> oerheks yes. I was able to back it up with ddrescue

[00:15:35] <Guest14> oerheks wdym? this is a good disk though
[00:15:51] <oerheks> How is it possible for a 466G file to be in /home when /home is 441G? .. errors in the filetable?
[00:15:51] <thismachine> Guest14, could be reflinks or compression, too. You can use compsize to figure out if that's the cause of the discrepancy
[00:16:05] <thismachine> tohreyn, oerheks thanks
[00:16:24] <Guest14> So I plugged my faulty disk into my good computer and used ddrescue to back it up, though, I used the sparse flag
[00:16:54] <Guest14> I thought that might explain why a '466G' file can be in a 441G partition
[00:17:03] <Guest14> I don't see any other way
[00:17:32] <gordonjcp> Guest14: is it owned by root?
[00:18:48] <gordonjcp> Guest14: root gets 5% more disk space than is really shown, you can have a disk at over 100% capacity

[00:25:07] <Guest14> Okay. I guess my google-fu is better today. Apparently one can tell a sparse file's size using `du -h --apparent-size sba1.img` to see how much it could expand to
[00:25:26] <Guest14> and `du -h sba`.img` to check the _actual_ size
[00:26:16] <Guest14> In this case, the actual size is 187G. That explains why it is sitting on /dev/sda6 which only is 441G and it is only 45% used

[00:33:26] <TJ-> Guest14: but you could also attach the file to a loopdev (/dev/loopX) so it appears as a block device

[00:34:04] <TJ-> Guest14: e.g. "sudo losetup -f -P --show path/to/file.img" and that will report which /dev/loopX it is attached to
[00:34:24] <TJ-> Guest14: yes; more tooling options that would expect the file-system in a block device

[00:36:04] <Guest14> so I guess before I run "sudo losetup -f -P --show path/to/file.img" I have to attach file.img to a loopdev?
[00:36:29] <Guest14> Would I pass /dev/loopX to fsck or file.img?

[00:39:41] *** Quits: RougeR (~rougex250@user/rouger) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:40:08] <TJ-> loopdev isn't bothered whether what is in the file makes sense as a block device; it just presents whatever is in the file as a block-addressable device that behaves somewhat like a physical disk/SSD
[00:41:04] <Guest14> I'm curious though to 'mount' this file as a block device, would I need 187G (_actual_ size used in disk by sparse file) free or 441G (the maximum size to which file.img may expand)?
[00:41:28] <TJ-> doesn't enter into it
[00:42:22] <Guest14> I see. I'm curious, what is file.mapfile for? We haven't needed so far
[00:42:50] <TJ-> no space/memory is being used. All a lopdev does is translate sector based access (e.g. read sector 8) to a fseek(path/to/file, 512 * 8, SEEK_SET)
[00:42:50] <Guest14> Does linux know 'this (sparse) file img.file has a matching file.mapfile'?
[00:43:19] <TJ-> Guest14: the mapfile was created by ddrescue to record which sectors it managed to extract and which had problems
[00:43:50] <TJ-> Guest14: the mapfile is nothing to do with anything but the ddrescue tool (it can use the mapfile to restart/resume a recovery)
[00:44:47] <Guest14> Got it. That makes sense. For some reason I thought it was a 'metadata' sort of thing in general and not only for ddrescue

[06:48:38] <Guest5210> leftyfb: i had the idea to give them an idea to improve on that idea, as the way the implemented it right now, can hinder new installs (while there is a phased update)
[06:49:09] <leftyfb> Guest5210: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/
[06:49:17] <Guest5210> thanks :)
[06:49:54] <sarnold> Guest5210: or perhaps even a bug report! :) installing things should work imho
[06:50:54] <Guest5210> yeah on my other pc, i had issues getting wine installed as mesa-vulkan-drivers had the new version, but mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386 had the old one :/
[06:52:24] <sarnold> I would have expected all the binaries from one source package to be phased identically
[06:52:51] <sarnold> I've seen variations on this for years and never figured out that phasing might be involved
[06:53:41] <Guest5210> sarnold this is what I figured, but seems like they didn't think about i386 packages (i mean it's already a bit of a backburner nowadays)

[13:08:27] <newhoa> If I select a mirror in Software & Updates it works fine. It's just the Main server. Yesterday it downloaded the package lists fine but the actual downloads were crazy slow or failed.

[20:40:25] <quadrat> eh, edge  (which is based on 20.10 in this cycle) is just the release which will be the next "normal" hwe stack, which gets released in fall this year.

[20:43:13] <quadrat> and they get backported to LTS releases

I'm trying to figure out how to plan the update properly. Given ubuntu doesn't really support major version updates the current dilemma is whether it's worth to wait for 22.04 LTS and switch to that version or to use 20.04 with those backports stuff

[20:55:24] <oerheks> weird, no updates, and you can irc...
[20:55:31] <webchat36> No updates but I can irc.
[20:55:38] <webchat36> it says I have no network.
[20:55:44] <webchat36> I don't know how to manually configure the network
[20:55:54] <quadrat> webchat36 what happens if you try to download packages?
[20:55:54] <webchat36> although I figured out how to add a wired network
[20:56:00] <webchat36> it says no network can't download
[20:56:15] <oerheks> one better install Kubuntu solely.
[20:56:19] <Mekaneck> way too weird
[20:56:38] <Mekaneck> oerheks: already suggested to install kubuntu and then add a server
[20:56:40] <webchat36> I can't use Kubuntu.  I need root access to use Drupal.  You can't root access from Kubuntu

[20:56:59] <webchat36> trust me...it's what it is doing
[20:57:03] <oerheks> sure you can be root, with sudo
[20:57:09] <oerheks> good luck!

[21:10:01] <Mekaneck> why don't you just do as i said, install kubuntu first THEN add a server for your needs
[21:10:35] <webchat36> I tried installing Kubuntu and then following Drupal instructions.  It didn't work
[21:10:44] <webchat36> It also wouldn't let me install synaptic.  I like synaptic.
[21:10:51] <webchat36> something about weyland being active
[21:11:23] <Mekaneck> wayland... switch to xorg instead then
[21:11:26] <webchat36> If I install Kubuntu and then I get stuck when I can't access the root command would you help then or tell me not to use the root command?
[21:12:12] <webchat36> All the instructions for Drupal come with installing a system the way I've installed it, except that I wanted a graphic interface.  So I installed one.  But it won't see the internet
[21:12:33] <webchat36> I looked at the connection suggestions posted.  I have no idea what all of that is about.
[21:12:43] <webchat36> I usually use DHCP when I install linux
[21:13:12] <Mekaneck> if i had a solution i'd provide it
[21:13:14] <alkisg> webchat36: the server version installs netplan, while you want to use the network-manager GUI. It's indeed simpler to start with kubuntu and then install drupal, than to remove all the server bits that you don't like

[21:14:11] <alkisg> Right
[21:14:21] <webchat36> But how do I get synaptic on Drupal.  It wouldn't let me add that. and I want synaptic.
[21:14:23] <alkisg> Note the message and paste it here when it happens
[21:14:29] <webchat36> Kept on going about Wayland
[21:14:38] <alkisg> sudo apt install synaptic
[21:14:42] <webchat36> I was a mepis user.
[21:14:43] <alkisg> synaptic isn't related to drupal though
[21:14:49] <Mekaneck> you can't get synaptic on Drupal
[21:14:52] <webchat36> No, it's related to how I use linux
[21:14:53] <alkisg> It's a package manager, like discover
[21:15:11] <webchat36> So I can download other stuff I like, to get a working system
[21:15:18] <alkisg> Sure
