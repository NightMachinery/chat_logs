[04:33:32] <JollyRgrs> you sure you want our help?
[04:33:40] <jimender2> I am building a CTF based on some stuff that I see in factories
[04:33:43] <jimender2> yes JollyRgrs
[04:33:49] <jxel> heya
[04:34:15] <jimender2> I need a name for my factory and I need a product (or series of products) that this factory makes
[04:34:25] <jimender2> any suggestions?
[04:34:39] <JollyRgrs> what kind of factory?
[04:34:56] <JollyRgrs> meat packing? car parts?
[04:35:07] <JollyRgrs> button factory?
[04:35:15] <JollyRgrs> hello, my name is joe, and i work in a button factory
[04:35:34] <jimender2> I have seen these issues in a bunch of different types of factories. Car, food, beverage

[04:36:21] <JollyRgrs> lingerie
[04:36:28] <JollyRgrs> like you sit in it and linger
[04:36:41] <jimender2> but I need a suggestion for what the factory makes and what to name it
[04:36:57] <JollyRgrs> does it have to be realistic or can you have fun with the names?
[04:37:18] <jimender2> I can have fun with it as long as it is SFW
[04:37:22] <JollyRgrs> like, sex toy maker?
[04:37:23] <JollyRgrs> nvm
[04:37:25] <JollyRgrs> lol
[04:37:44] <JollyRgrs> how about Wham-O type stuff
[04:37:59] <JollyRgrs> slip n slide, nerf guns, big wheels
[04:39:25] <jimender2> that might work
[04:42:57] <JollyRgrs> at least is a fun walk down memory lane as you make up the products
[04:43:25] <jimender2> I never had wham o stuff
[04:43:43] <jimender2> but suggestions for the name of the company since I cant use wham-o
[04:43:44] <JollyRgrs> https://wham-o.com/
[04:43:53] <JollyRgrs> BLAM-O
[04:44:41] <jimender2> all that wham o stuff was deemed too dangerous to have

[12:46:12] <monoxane> irc is definitely past its heyday, but its still very useful and theres a lot of fun things that happen on it
[12:47:09] <monoxane> im not old either, im 21, and have no legacy reason to be using it, but its just another way to connect with people online, and a lot of people in this industry still seem to use it, so i might as well be where the people are, even if it means using something 99% of the population would call outdated
[12:47:48] <monoxane> saying that i did get started programming writing irc bots and all that fun stuff, so there is a bit of nostalgia, even if it isnt as strong as some of the people who've been using it for 20+ years

[21:41:55] <sd> 09<U​NCLE MUSCLE'S> Yeah. But I'm not sure how to do it any other way except see if I can make a smal;l 8GB volume with mint and all the settings and software we need on it. And then see if  I can use LVM to expand into the extra disk space
[21:41:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> (or hcange distros)
[21:42:07] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> no no - you need to do *proper* imaging
