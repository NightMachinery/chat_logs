[02:07:25] <goodger> [01:31] <ngoldbaum> for sure this is 100% a fuckup by the cops for not having situational awareness before charging in
[02:07:34] <goodger> cannot tell if this is meant to be a joke
[04:14:48] <companion_cube> if it had been the army instead of cops, their engagement rules would probably have banned them from shooting the guy :p
[04:29:19] <quanticle> I don't know that it was 100% a fuckup by the cops. Like I was telling one of my friends elsewhere, "From the police officer's perspective, he's received an armed suspect, shots fired call, and when he gets there he sees a dude holding a rifle and another dude bleeding out on the floor."
[04:30:47] <companion_cube> I imagine the guy wasn't pointing his gun and shooting, though
[04:31:45] <quanticle> No, but there was a mismatch in expectations. The guy with the rifle knows he's the "good guy". The cop does not. So when the cop comes upon him and tells him to freeze and drop the weapon, compliance may not have been instantaneous.
[04:32:02] <quanticle> And the cop's priority in that situation is to prevent other people from getting shot
[04:32:14] <companion_cube> I'd like to know if the cop did say that before shooting.
[04:32:54] <quanticle> They probably did, but it's an open question whether the person with the rifle heard or had a chance to comprehend what was going on before he got shot.

[19:49:09] <companion_cube> but they can afford rewrites because what matters is papers, not having a continuously stable program.

[19:50:36] <companion_cube> (it's research after all)
[19:50:48] <companion_cube> so the new version can be more poweful and clean by doing a rewrite.

[20:14:00] <riv> ngoldbaum, so the first dose doesn't do mch? it  needs the second to have impact?
[20:14:13] <riv> can someone make a law against variants or something pls
[20:14:58] <ngoldbaum> the first dose reduces the severity of disease
[20:15:07] <Xe> riv: that's how it's always been???
[20:15:09] <Xe> that's why you need two doses???
[20:15:13] <ngoldbaum> iiuc, deaths are down compared to earlier waves
[20:16:00] <companion_cube> also apparently, getting covid-19 is more or less like getting one dose? you still need a second dose to be fully protected
[20:16:51] <riv> i see
