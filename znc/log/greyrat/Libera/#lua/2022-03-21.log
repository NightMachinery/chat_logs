[00:21:54] <nmz> https://termbin.com/5cgk whats wrong with this?
[00:22:12] <nmz> I was trying to find EOL but when I tried it on windows, it also was "\n"
[00:22:20] <nmz> is eol always \n for lua?

[00:23:43] <Habbie> i think it leaves it to the C library
[00:24:03] <nmz> mmm
[00:24:40] <nmz> what does that mean?
[00:24:53] <furq_> it hasn't been \r on mac since os 9
[00:24:58] *** furq_ is now known as furq
[00:25:01] <nmz> ah
[00:25:23] <Habbie> nmz, it means, if i'm right (which you should verify), it's not a Lua question, but a generic platform question
[00:25:27] <Habbie> nmz, so what happens if you run this code?
[00:25:37] <furq> you can probably just unconditionally use \n nowadays
[00:25:57] <furq> unless you expect this file to be opened in something that will have issues 
[00:26:10] <Habbie> also, what is read"L"?
[00:26:12] <furq> even notepad can cope with \n nowadays
[00:26:26] <furq> Habbie: i think 5.3 made L an alias for *L
[00:26:51] <Habbie> ah just found that
[00:26:59] <Habbie> or something like that, yes
[00:27:09] <furq> or rather it got rid of the *s and then kept them as aliases
[00:27:25] <furq> i never really understood why they were there in the first place but i still use them out of habit

[12:06:53] <paxed> is it possible to detect "local a = foo();" vs. "local a, b = foo();" in foo?
[12:07:47] <rjek> You want to know if your caller is disregarding one of your return values?  Probably not without using the debug library and/or examining the bytecode of your caller
[12:08:52] <paxed> or make foo return different things based on that
[12:09:14] <paxed> i looked at the debug lib, but it wasn't clear to me how i could do it
[12:09:43] <rjek> I think, in general, if you have to reach for the debug library you /should't/ do it :)
[12:10:51] <paxed> hm. i guess i'll scrap that idea, and try to work out something else. thanks.

[17:34:55] <bomb> Fortnite is generating five billion bucks per year, making it the top grossing Lua host program of all time

[17:37:29] <MattJ> Fortnite's chat also uses XMPP, combining two of my favourite things into a very successful product
[17:37:42] <MattJ> Apart from this fact, I've no idea what Fortnite is (other than it's a game)
[17:38:11] <furq> that seems like a lie
[17:38:28] <bomb> nah, numbers from the court records
[17:38:31] <MattJ> Which part?
[17:38:56] <bomb> Fortnite's iOS revenue is only $700 million
[17:39:00] <furq> you know what fortnite is
[17:39:06] <bomb> Adobe's total revenue is 13 billion
[17:39:39] <furq> my whole deal includes not knowing about any video games made since 2001 and i could explain fortnite pretty correctly
[17:39:47] <furq> there's no way anyone doesn't know what it is
[17:40:07] <bomb> he told it's a game
[17:40:37] <Elw3> I avso only know the name, but never saw what its actually about
[17:40:48] <furq> i don't think this is possible
[17:41:00] <Elw3> Is it a shooter, an mmorpg?
[17:41:03] <furq> just say it sucks and you've never played it that's fine
[17:41:09] <furq> don't lie and pretend you don't know what it is
[17:41:19] <Elw3> no srsly
[17:41:22] <bomb> how anyone is supposed to learn Fortnite details?
[17:41:37] <bomb> you either play it, or watch someone else playing it, or read about it
[17:41:46] <furq> idk i've never played it
[17:41:55] <bomb> but you obviously did others
[17:44:41] <furq> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0SA7YSYpUc&t=7514s

[18:30:50] <jdarnley> that would appeal to the JS userd
