[00:21:26] <lz_> Nasp: no ? I'm talking about nitter
[00:21:34] <Suchiman> jonp: well putin was increasing the combat readyness of their nuclear forces, stating: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comments which forced the Russian president's hand were "absolutely unacceptable" but resisted naming the person who was to blame. "I would not call the authors of these statements by name, although it was the British foreign minister," he said.

[00:25:27] <bomb> isn't it a bit relaxing to know that when you die everyone else also does?
[00:25:54] <lz_> probably not
[00:26:13] <lz_> covid had tons of people die, families couldn't grieve properly
[00:26:20] <jonp> bomb: it's a bit relaxing to know that "duck and cover" is bullshit, and i can relax since i'll die anyway

[00:28:18] <lz_> Suchiman: my point was if many people are dying, there's no time for proper grief, especially if ppl need to survive
[00:28:22] <lz_> that applies both to covid and war
[00:28:36] <jonp> cynicism is reasonable in the face of death from above

[01:23:12] <brianonymous> all my inserts were extremely flat and dumb, but from what i recall all the writing seemed to suck from my expectations of what i wanted
[01:23:15] <_genuser_> Suchiman with the above example where you could just say: dbcontext.save(a) and it writes to both tables?
[01:23:26] <Nasp> brianonymous: Have you gotten a price estimate? :D

[02:12:23] <brianonymous> hey Suchiman ... am I allowed to use spans to walk a whole fuckin struct over a byte array
[02:12:32] <brianonymous> or even a class mebbe?
[02:13:08] <Suchiman> brianonymous: you mean using var myStructSpan = MemoryMarshal.Cast<byte, MyStruct>(byteSpan) ?
[02:13:38] <brianonymous> yeah, in that particular case am i making a new struct each cast?
[02:14:07] <Suchiman> brianonymous: well it basically just reinterprets the bytes as that struct, that is fine to do, isn't allowed with classes obviously,
[02:14:36] <brianonymous> i see. so that shit is locked to the local stack
[02:15:10] <Suchiman> brianonymous: if you wanna avoid copying anything you can do fancy stuff like: ref MyStruct str = ref myStructSpan[0]; and then str.Field = 42; will modify the original byte array
[02:15:58] <brianonymous> is Memory the heap equiv? can i fart out whole class instances with a cast some way?
[02:17:32] <Suchiman> brianonymous: no, all this does is reinterpreting bytes as something else, those bytes are not valid heap objects by themselfs though so you cannot cast them to classes, the GC would be very confused to be able to  find a class in the middle of the memory of what it considers to be a byte array and what is it supposed to do with that? clean it up and leave a hole in the byte array if it gets unused? xD
[02:18:44] <Suchiman> brianonymous: which is why there's this guard https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/MemoryMarshal.cs,174
[02:18:57] <brianonymous> gotcha.. i need to make a new binary parser, and Im trying to see what new modern bits i can utilize rather than hand building container instances
[02:19:25] <brianonymous> a copy wouldnt be a bad thing, since id end up essentially doing that by hand anyways
[02:19:56] <Suchiman> brianonymous: so yeah you can create a copy easily by doing MyStruct str = myStructSpan[0];
[02:20:10] <brianonymous> but only for struct
[02:20:23] <brianonymous> i think that might be acceptable terms
[02:20:24] <Suchiman> brianonymous: indeed, you could do a class MyStructClass that has a single field of MyStruct :P
[02:20:48] <brianonymous> im just trying to think about how much ill need to pass them around
[02:20:58] <Suchiman> brianonymous: you can pass them around with ref's ofc

[02:32:31] <brianonymous> Suchiman: berry interesting
[02:32:43] <hseg> like, ig I could rewrite Cast as { return (B)i as T; } for my usecase, but that is incorrect in general
[02:33:00] <Suchiman> brianonymous: basically that's like: basically that only involves a single copy, from the bytes of the byte array into the struct field of the class via reinterpretation
[02:33:10] <brianonymous> Suchiman: is there a reason you structlayout'ed the class too?
[02:33:16] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Can i pass a span or memory into a method and return a subset or new span?

[02:41:15] <brianonymous> does it?
[02:41:34] <hseg> it at least has the same behaviour
[02:41:36] <lz_> i didn't understand the question
[02:42:04] <brianonymous> i honestly dont know, but would find it odd too
[02:42:21] <brianonymous> does the overridden code fire at all?
[02:42:22] <_genuser_> I do'nt know the explicit reasons, but I'd guess if a T can pass for it's base class a casted type would have to be also.
[02:42:32] <hseg> I have base and derived class B, D, with casts from int. D accepts fewer ints than B, both null on invalid input
[02:43:10] <hseg> now, when I write T Cast(int i) where T : B { return (T)i; }, it gives the same behaviour as (T)(B)i, and not as (T)i
[02:43:37] <hseg> *Cast<T>
[02:43:57] <hseg> specifically, testing at a value B accepts but D doesn't, I get that Cast<D> errors, (D) returns null, and (D)(B) errors
[02:44:20] <hseg> overridden code doesn't appear to fire at all
[02:44:21] <Suchiman> brianonymous: and the code lets you easily decide between operating on the stack or going to heap

[02:51:17] <_genuser_> brianonymous so the memorymarshal maps the byte[] onto the struct, which is passed into the class later, and the class maps properties to specific fields of the struct. Is that correct understanding?
[02:51:39] <hseg> ok,  https://is.gd/TxE1Tm vindicates my hunch
[02:52:19] <hseg> I suspect this is because C# can't care about Derived having an int cast
[02:52:26] <hseg> since casts are static methods
[02:52:27] <brianonymous> _genuser_ the struct itself vomits over the properties of the class, since the offsets are adjusted in such a way that one overlaps the other
[02:52:34] <hseg> and therefore cannot be constrained on
[02:52:47] <brianonymous> so in essence, they become one. the holy binding. merged as lovers
[02:53:03] <JakeSays> like yermom
[02:53:03] <hseg> so instead it picks the only available casting path, namely int -> Base -> Derived
[02:53:37] <brianonymous> Suchiman: that still holds for write to those class props too, right?
[02:53:42] <_genuser_> brianonymous, makes sense. I don't know what I'd use it for. but when needed, I can see how annoying it would be for other devs.
[02:53:47] <Suchiman> brianonymous: yep
[02:53:49] <_genuser_> now I kinda _want_ to find a reason to use that.
[02:54:12] <hseg> and ofc, can't do anything clever like expose a static T.Cast(), becuse, again, static members can't be constrained for
[02:54:35] <hseg> I hate this language and its host of second-class citizens
[02:55:15] <jonp> hseg: time for static abstract interface members?
[02:55:35] <brianonymous> _genuser_: in my case, i have a byte array that i need to chop up and goosh into class containers with meaningful values.. usually thats a hand process for me, where i walk the bytes, mask out what i want, and just build a data model.. this allows me to use the actual protocol data to populate things without any additional manual element.. as well as many other added benefits
[02:55:40] <hseg> except $DAYJOB keeps me stuck in 7.3
[02:56:08] <_genuser_> brianonymous that'd be such a time saver.
[02:56:13] <brianonymous> huuuuge
[02:56:28] <jonp> hseg: in theory, you *may* be able to update to newer language versions; not all language features require updated runtimes.
[02:56:32] <jonp> requires care, though
[02:56:52] <jonp> "static abstract interface members" requires .NET 6+ though, and likely .NET 7
[02:57:38] <hseg> am not going to risk my boss's patience budget on this, especially considering that for my case, replacing (T)-casting with as-casting works

[03:21:39] <Nasp> Well not sure if it's real or not
[03:21:44] <Nasp> Also man the shipping fees
[03:22:52] <brianonymous> a T-14 apparently weighs 48 tons
[03:22:56] <irwiss> shipping fees are less of a problem, it's more that exporting or importing anything weapons related (including software) is a crime in most countries
[03:23:20] <irwiss> you need special permit from both source and destination to do it legally
[03:24:16] <Nasp> I wonder if a normal weapons import permit would be enough

[03:29:42] <JakeSays> interesting. that company will handle everything related to the purchase
[03:30:05] <brianonymous> the general feel is you can own a tank at the cost range of $30k-350k
[03:30:47] <brianonymous> stuff like WIII panzers look like they can go as high as a few mil
[03:31:20] <JakeSays> that'd be a fun business to own

[03:33:46] <_genuser_> brianonymous if you're riding a tank, I'd imagine you'd take as long as it takes.
[03:34:03] <_genuser_> getting close to suvs, watching them swerve.
[03:34:16] <_genuser_> and nobody an see inside. you coudl be drinking beer and having chips and salsa.
[03:34:18] <JakeSays> um, tanks aren't street legal
[03:34:35] <DoofusCanadensis> cities would take issue with the way treads tear up the streets
[03:34:37] <_genuser_> JakeSays sure they are. just get brake lights, turn signals and a plate.
[03:34:42] <jonp> they're close to the *opposite* of street legal
[03:34:45] <JakeSays> towns tend to frown on large tracked vehicles chewing up their roads
[03:34:52] <jonp> something about  about tank treads destroying roads
[03:35:17] <_genuser_> but you'd finally get to actually use your tax dollars to the max.
[03:35:23] <JakeSays> also parking would be a bitch
[03:35:26] <_genuser_> you pay for the roads, you use them till they wear out.
[03:35:37] <_genuser_> lol, just roll on top of whatever cars are in the way.
[03:35:39] <jonp> JakeSays: just park far away from the entrance to stores, that's all ;-)
[03:35:45] <jonp> _genuser_: or that.
[03:36:01] <JakeSays> jonp: even then it'd be tough.
[03:36:11] <JakeSays> couldn't part on a street because the damn thing would take up most of it
[03:36:16] <_genuser_> jonp I used to do that with my previous car. I had bought it brand new. And there's alway someone who has to leave the entire open parking lot and park right next to you.
[03:36:19] <jonp> how wide are they?  is two spaces side-by-side not enough?
[03:36:43] <jonp> JakeSays: well, that's a street, not a parking lot
[03:36:50] <_genuser_> jonp herd mentality I assume. Oh let's part over there, but why leave a space, let's fill up spaces in an orderly fashion. Oh my, did my door hit that car? no worries it's "just a car"
[03:37:02] <JakeSays> jonp: the T-72 is 3.42m wide
[03:37:14] <Diablo-D3> yeah but how do I get one and take it home
[03:37:21] <JakeSays> so little over 11 feet
[03:37:30] <jonp> JakeSays: < 12' sounds like it could be 2-3 spaces/

[03:40:22] <Suchiman> brianonymous: btw. while i've used fields in the struct and props in the class, you might as well just use props both in both, then you don't need to vary the FieldOffset attribute by the field: prefix and can just do a straight copy from the struct
[03:40:26] <_genuser_> I think even Smart cars are bigger than those tanks.

[03:43:47] <hseg> OK, so tracked down _yet another_ "C# behaves differently from my expectations" bug. Why can't I declare a class to be covariant in a generic?
[03:44:08] <jonp> hseg: 'cause it's not up to the type, but to the member declaration
[03:44:17] <_genuser_> jonp, right this is 'murica! a real tank is what we would like!
[03:44:20] <hseg> ?
[03:44:23] <jonp> hseg: you can do `IEnumerabe<out T> M<T>(…)`
[03:44:38] <jonp> which is covariant (iirc)
[03:45:07] <hseg> right, but why can't I do class MyContainer<out T> { private List<T> container; ... } ?
[03:45:29] <jonp> `out T` means it needs to be used in method return types
[03:45:34] <jonp> that's not a return type
[03:46:07] <hseg> ... ?
[03:46:53] <jonp> hseg: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-generic-modifier#example---covariant-generic-interface
[03:47:14] <hseg> right, where does it say anything about return types?
[03:47:43] <jonp> > An interface that has a covariant type parameter enables its methods to return more derived types than those specified by the type parameter.
[03:48:31] <_genuser_> buying a tank: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEhEjrK4V-o
[03:48:40] <hseg> sure, but that's because C# artificially restricts what covariance means
[03:49:12] <jonp> _genuser_: of course they're buying a Tank in Texas
[03:49:34] <hseg> covariance basically means "all occurrences of this type variable are in positive position"
[03:49:43] <hseg> .... wait a minute
[03:49:43] <_genuser_> jonp she said she used to live in texas. I'm assuming she'll buy and take it wherever she lives now.
[03:50:01] <brianonymous> Suchiman: since my payload is a fixed len, i was even thinking of trying an array directly
[03:50:08] <jonp> _genuser_: she used to live in TX, and is buying the tank in TX…
[03:50:12] <_genuser_> jonp lol, she asked if you can drive it through chik-fil-a drive through. And the guy says it will fit through.
[03:50:16] <hseg> not only is C# more restricted, it appears to use the opposite terminology of what I expect
[03:50:28] <brianonymous> Suchiman: bypass the need for a struct
[03:50:43] <_genuser_> jonp I hope I don't have an interest in buying tanks now. Because that sounds expensive.
[03:50:57] <jonp> they haven't mentioned price yet
[03:51:00] <jonp> how much?
[03:51:23] <Suchiman> brianonymous: lol yeah I was thinking about that but didn't suggest it since this seemed cooler and the manual copy into the fixed field is ugly :p
[03:51:24] <_genuser_> I had seen elsewhere it was 50k - 350k range for all. This one look small. I'll have to watch more to see if they mention price.
[03:51:34] <jonp> "cheaper-end" is 30-50K
[03:51:37] <jonp> *cheap*!
[03:51:52] <jonp> at ~2min45sec
[03:51:54] <jonp> give or take
[03:51:54] <_genuser_> jonp geez, I just saw that bit.

[03:52:16] <_genuser_> jonp lol she says it's cheaper than her truck. youtube money coming in by the millions.
[03:52:33] <brianonymous> just makes sense tho since i will always have 188 byte long containers
[03:52:34] <jonp> _genuser_: a top of the line F-350 is > $50K
[03:52:37] <jonp> so that's not hard to do

[03:53:17] <_genuser_> jonp true that. I've seen the raptors are easily 80k.

[03:53:57] <Diablo-D3> this is technically true.
[03:54:06] <Suchiman> brianonymous: and it requires marking the code as unsafe, notice how its totally not unsafe right now ;p
[03:54:15] <Diablo-D3> the number in the F is for how many thousand it costs.

[04:10:22] <Xenoprimate> brianonymous / Suchiman Can you even apply a StructLayout attr to a class's members?
[04:10:25] <jonp> wat
[04:10:29] <Suchiman> jonp: i'm basically casting a byte array into a class with only a single copy :D
[04:10:44] <brianonymous> jonp: its dark magic i tell ya!
[04:10:47] <Suchiman> jonp: no? MyStructClass.Id overlaps with myStructClass.data.Id
[04:11:10] <jonp> that too!
[04:11:20] <jonp> MyStruct is 8 bytes in size though
[04:11:30] <Suchiman> jonp: and MyStructClass.Version overlaps with MyStructClass.data.Version
[04:11:30] <brianonymous> it allows me to carry a modifable, ready for wire data block, its so deviously rad
[04:11:31] <jonp> and MyStructclass.Version starts at offset 4
[04:11:35] <Xenoprimate> I mean, the idea of overlapping fields makes sense to me. But the layout of class fields is not something I ever thought would work
[04:11:53] <Xenoprimate> Are we sure that is actually working and you're not getting lucky with the order of the fields?
[04:11:57] <brianonymous> Xenoprimate: exactly, i never would have expected the compiler to go along with such things
[04:12:04] <Suchiman> Xenoprimate: yes :P
[04:12:17] <jonp> still a tad horrifying
[04:12:20] <Suchiman> Xenoprimate: i have explicit layout and tell the compiler exactly how to align them, there's no luck involved
[04:12:27] <jonp> not sure if that's better or worse than Duff's Device
[04:12:38] <brianonymous> a tad horrifying, but its use is also in an equally terrifying domain, so acceptable
[04:12:40] <Xenoprimate> Suchiman I know that, but StructLayout should only work on, um, structs
[04:12:48] <Suchiman> Xenoprimate: haha no :P
[04:12:50] <jonp> Xenoprimate: it's used for marshaling too
[04:12:57] <Xenoprimate> Hmm, makes sense
[04:12:58] <jonp> and you can pass classes to P/Invokes
[04:13:03] <Xenoprimate> Good point jonp
[04:13:11] <brianonymous> i just never though the compiler would allow you to do such trickery
[04:13:24] <jonp> brianonymous: just don't try to overlap a ref type w/ a struct
[04:13:27] <jonp> the runtime complains
[04:13:28] <Xenoprimate> Well then I'm happy. Overlapping fields is a mainstay of C-style unions
[04:13:28] <Suchiman> brianonymous: the one thing it doesn't allow you is to union GC and non GC fields
[04:13:36] <brianonymous> naw, this will be pure containered data instances
[04:14:00] <jonp> https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/issues/956#issuecomment-1050276332
[04:14:26] <brianonymous> Suchiman: that should be a problem. mostly will be used for read ops
[04:14:37] <brianonymous> shouldNT
[04:14:52] <brianonymous> entirely primative type based
[04:15:11] <brianonymous> in fact, a lot of shit is bit level
[04:15:24] <Suchiman> brianonymous: and at the end of the day, if you need additional fields in the class that are not in the struct, you can just add them with an FieldOffset beyond the struct and they can be GC fields as well
[04:15:47] <brianonymous> yeah! thats where ill hide my bit readers
[04:16:05] <Suchiman> brianonymous: won't they be just getter only props without backing fields?
[04:16:23] <brianonymous> it may be nice to mask/shift once
[04:16:28] <Suchiman> i see
[04:16:32] <brianonymous> up for debate
[04:16:49] <brianonymous> this is gonna be a high flow stream, so i gotta be quick about things
[04:17:23] <Suchiman> brianonymous: gotta measure what perf impact caching has
[04:17:53] <brianonymous> in what sense of caching
[04:18:00] <brianonymous> the literal die cache?
[04:18:14] <Suchiman> brianonymous: by caching the bit ops into a field
[04:18:18] <Suchiman> vs. doing them every time
[04:19:18] <brianonymous> i may be able to do a 1 time read -> process... theres a lot of fields, and im not entirely sure how much i will actually need just yet

[04:40:04] <Nasp> Yup
[04:40:04] <JakeSays> Suchiman: no it ended on the 28th
[04:40:15] <brianonymous> i truly understand the emotions behind, just not the strategy.. tho at the same time, in WWII, japanese were told that if the US invades we would walk around with their babies heads on baynets.. the result ended up being mothers throwing their children off cliffs when we landed in some pacific islands
[04:40:16] <Suchiman> oh?
[04:40:17] <Nasp> They ofc also used their veto
[04:40:39] <JakeSays> brianonymous: i think the strategy is sound
[04:41:06] <Nasp> Which strategy
[04:41:10] <JakeSays> Suchiman: yeah the SC presidency rotates on a monthly basis
[04:41:16] <JakeSays> Nasp: no pows
[04:42:26] <brianonymous> i think its not sound because i sense the russian army is already demoralized at some level, and so the capture of POW would probably be directly related to willingness

[04:43:35] <JakeSays> brianonymous: i don't think many think that way.

[04:45:36] <sysRPL> and solidworks 2009
[04:46:52] <sysRPL> anyhow, i tried a few other parametric modelers before solidsworks, and in the little time i tried solidworks it seem A LOT better than freecad or solvespace

[04:47:11] <Nasp> gogogo
[04:48:23] <sysRPL> solidworks seems really simple so far, but maybe i am missing a whole bunch

[04:49:05] <sysRPL> and when i googled it the solution seemed dumb
[04:49:16] <JakeSays> ukraine should start bombing moscow
[04:49:52] <jonp> maybe they've collected enough bombs from Russia to do that?
[04:50:05] <sysRPL> the solidworks way to make a sphere = draw a hald arc circle, create an axis, the lathe the axis around the axis
[04:50:33] <JakeSays> we could let them test our new ballistic missile
[04:50:53] <sysRPL> ukraine is going to lose
[04:51:03] <sysRPL> sorry, but they have no chance
[04:51:43] <sysRPL> their best best would be to use mind games, draw the russians in, then ambush the russians and form an insurgency to last for a decade
[04:52:03] <JakeSays> it's 775km from kiev to moscow. they could convert civilian aircraft to drones filled with explosives
[04:52:08] <sysRPL> they can't fight the straight up or survive a siege

[05:02:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: c5 has a higher density
[05:03:03] <bpmedley> ravindUwU : You can make a Middleware that extracts the query param and adds a request header..
[05:03:27] <ravindUwU> I remember reading something about being able to specify the name of query param, or even multiple sources to retrieve the token from, but I don't recall what it is called -_-. Maybe this was ASP.NET (not Core?)

[06:44:46] <irwiss> sort of, .sln is a group of projects you can open in VS, if you run msbuild on it - it'll also build them, but whether it's entire program or not depends on what's inside, some projects might have multiple .sln files to compile different parts if build is complex

[11:26:30] <Beam> So i have a WPF app where i have sensor values that update frequently that can be subscribed to. Many of the callbacks include INotifyPropertyChanged classes which will raise PropertyChanged within the callback. Some of the callbacks has important code like watchdog/feedback. I have one thread for reading sensor changes and updating sensor array. Then another thread that loops over sensor
[11:26:30] <Beam> array and if changed invokes the callbacks. I'm getting some odd lag where randomly the loops of callbacks take a lot of time and the watchdog obviously times out. (Up to 2 seconds lag) I assume INotifyPropertyChanged and ui threads may lock or something? Is there a better way to do what i'm doing?

[11:32:40] <Beam> I used to have a threadpool in the dispatcher loop so up to 8 tasks could be running callbacks, and it was somewhat better (i guess because if one callback took longer, it wouldn't matter so much), but it would still have problems (probably get congested and time out anyway). And the massive amounts of thread handling involved i assume would be detrimental to the app. (It's about 100 sensors

[12:09:31] <dan01> Help....
[12:09:56] <dan01> I'm writing an IRC client in Swift not C#, but I need some OOP design advice here, and this channel rocks
[12:10:15] <dan01> So I decided to make a struct called Room, to represent and IRC channel, room
[12:10:56] <dan01> and then I have a separate class called MessageDispatcher, that receives messages from the server and should dispatch them to the appropriate room
[12:10:56] *** Joins: Beam (~michael@82.116.78.206)
[12:11:39] <dan01> But I'm not sure if this is wise, because since rooms are struct types, how do I pass them to the dispatched, or have the dispatcher talk with them without copying them?
[12:11:46] <dan01> Should room be a class?

[12:27:01] <MatthiasVance> A class room?
[12:27:04] <MatthiasVance> :D
[12:28:08] <ap5> Room should be a class
[12:28:26] <petererer> Does Swift have the struct/class distinction like C#?
[12:28:32] <Nasp> Aparently calling .Include makes requires the DbConnextion to be ready
[12:29:12] <ap5> petererer, i think C# has adopted it from the same languages that Swift has used for inspiration
[12:29:25] <dan01> petererer yes it does
[12:30:06] <dan01> ap5 So should I made the judgment of class or struct based on if I wanted something to be shared or not?
[12:30:19] <petererer> In my experience it's pretty rare to require struct instead of class.
[12:30:31] <dan01> Cause it seems to me it's impossible to share a struct
[12:30:50] <dan01> petererer true, but there is this trend to favor immutability like in strings
[12:31:00] <dan01> and to do that you have to use a struct
[12:31:01] <ap5> dan01, you should use a class. I dont know of any general rules when to use one over the other
[12:32:15] <dan01> Ok, thanks so say I use a class
[12:32:28] <dan01> Now what? I can just pass the classes to subscribe to the dispatcher, right?
[12:33:33] <ap5> I am not that into Swift, to tell you that :D
[12:33:51] <dan01> It's fine, nothing to do with Swift
[12:33:54] <dan01> Just imagine it's C#
[12:34:02] <dan01> It's more of an OOP question
[12:34:31] <ap5> I can see that classes are reference types in Swift, so you should just be able to pass it to the dispatcher
[12:34:40] <dan01> Sure
[12:34:51] <dan01> But I means as design, would you do it otherwise?
[12:35:08] <ap5> No. I would use a class for this
[12:35:44] <dan01> No I mean having rooms subscribe to dispatcher
[12:35:53] <dan01> Maybe I can do I Grand Central Queue
[12:35:57] <dan01> that's shared
[12:35:59] <dan01> or IDK
[12:36:34] <dan01> But I think with the subscription way, no room can see or touch messages for other rooms
[12:36:37] <dan01> which is better
[12:36:37] <ap5> Well, i really can't tell without more information on the general design etc, and i am the wrong to ask for this, because i have a lot to do right now because of work
[12:36:49] <dan01> ok
[12:38:02] <MatthiasVance> dan01: struct (if it works the same was as .NET) is NOT a good idea in most cases
[12:38:17] <MatthiasVance> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/choosing-between-class-and-struct
[12:38:35] <dan01> MatthiasVance yes it does work the same way
[12:39:13] <dan01> But that's the thing Apple seems to have this favoring of structs, even their lits, akka Arrays and Sets and Dictionaries are value types, aka structs
[12:39:51] <ap5> That is because it is thread safe, i think
[12:39:57] <ap5> (i am just guessing)
[12:41:08] <petererer> No wonder our 5GHz 16-core CPUs with 256GB RAM struggle to run anything these days :D
[12:41:43] <petererer> I should get the BBC Micro out, 32KB was much simpler.
[12:41:46] <dan01> hmmm I see
[12:41:56] <dan01> thanks  MatthiasVance
[12:42:35] <MatthiasVance> So what is the easiest way for this? I have a PR, did some extra work in a branch based on that, PR is merged in, I want to rebase it without getting conflicts from the earlier work
[12:42:41] <MatthiasVance> (or merge it idc)
[12:43:23] <MatthiasVance> it -> the branch based off the branch that was in the PR

[15:02:50] <Beam> gawd. i would like to quit wpf :/
[15:03:29] <bomb> don't. it's still the best we got :\
[15:03:53] <Beam> So. Some RaisePropertyChanged is locked inside wpf for like 100+ms - YET the app dispatcher is running like nothing's up
[15:04:05] <Beam> doesn't dispatcher run on ui thread?
[15:04:12] <bomb> event thread
[15:04:55] <bomb> so, no
[15:05:03] <Suchiman> brianonymous, JakeSays: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/354708842053107712/948836370066067487/RDT_20220302_2358383787388220934637335.png
[15:05:07] <Beam> Eh.. i always have to dispatch when playing with ui objects?
[15:05:13] <Beam> from another thread?
[15:05:28] <Beam> So ui objects are created on the event thread too then?
[15:05:32] <bomb> I think you're right, me confuse
[15:05:40] <bomb> dispatcher are in the UI thread
[15:05:46] <bomb> but rendering is done in another thread
[15:05:55] <Suchiman> bomb: no rendering is done on the UI thread
[15:06:06] <Beam> Right.
[15:06:10] <Suchiman> everything related to UI is done on the UI thread xD
[15:06:41] <Beam> So. How can the ui thread be blocking my PropertyChanged, while still running dispatcher timers like all is good?
[15:06:47] <kobo> "no rendering is done" or "no, rendering is done"?
[15:06:58] <Suchiman> kobo: latter
[15:07:04] <kobo> ok thanks
[15:07:37] <Beam> none of the traces make any sense to me :/
[15:08:14] <Suchiman> Beam: btw. what do you mean by "blocking"
[15:10:46] <Beam> https://pasteboard.co/FWwzA5BGGlE7.png
[15:11:07] <Beam> as in a call to PropertyChanged frequently takes several 100ms
[15:11:38] <Beam> there are being loads of calls made, but 1-2 times a second it just freezes up and doesn't return for 3-400ms
[15:12:02] <Beam> rendering is fluid, there's no fps drops in the profiler, no big gc peaks
[15:13:54] <Suchiman> Beam: am i interpreting the stacktrace correctly that it's stuck here? https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/blob/89d172db0b7a192de720c6cfba5e28a1e7d46123/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Wpf/src/PresentationFramework/MS/Internal/Data/CLRBindingWorker.cs#L404 (well in the else branch)
[15:14:39] <Suchiman> which means you're changing the properties on a second thread and invoking the Dispatcher to marshal to the ui thread is slow?
[15:14:50] <bomb> Suchiman it's WPF
[15:15:12] <Suchiman> bomb: thanks captain
[15:15:25] <bomb> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/threading-model?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8#overview-and-the-dispatcher
[15:15:58] <Beam> Yes that would be right. Like i explained a while ago, i have 2 threads running. One to read and decode sensor values, and one to check if the values have changed and fire callback subscriptions. most of these callbacks contain propertychanged to update ui.
[15:16:42] <Suchiman> Beam: and i suppose this is the lock that is contended https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/blob/89d172db0b7a192de720c6cfba5e28a1e7d46123/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Wpf/src/PresentationFramework/MS/Internal/Data/DataBindEngine.cs#L497
[15:17:02] <bomb> ah you mean "no, rendering is done on the UI thread"

[15:24:47] <Beam> Suchiman: don't you think?

[16:54:19] <MatthiasVance> jamea: What kind of project are you setting up?
[16:54:23] <chilversc> MatthiasVance: define project, as vscode can open a directory
[16:54:49] <MatthiasVance> chilversc: Something that "gives structure" to said collection, I want to see outgoing references etc
[16:55:50] <chilversc> ah, no idea on that, cloesest I've seen is using tools such as markdown linters, etc and running them from the command line
[16:56:43] <chilversc> I'm not really a fan of markdown beyond simple readme files though as it doesn't really have the complexity needed to write decent documentation, I normally prefer ascii doctor
[16:58:20] <MatthiasVance> chilversc: Yeah I have some markdown files in this repository and want to clean them up but also make sure discoverability is on point
[16:58:37] <jamea> MatthiasVance i explore a sample project, solved.... thanks Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json -Version 13.0.1

[18:19:52] <sorressean> I'm sorry if this isn't the place to ask, I'm totally stumped and hoping for some ideas. I have an asp.net page that I can't seem to create a testcase for in a pretty complex system. when I refresh or do anything with the page, everything is fine. When I click a column header in a listview to sort the listview, the entire footer (wrapped in a div tag with no id) is duplicated on the page and I can't
[18:19:58] <sorressean> figure out why. I enabled page-level tracing, but I'm trying to find another way to debug this because it just shows that the control is duplicated, which I already knew. Is there any way to know what creates the DataPager or somehow better debug this?
[18:21:13] <Suchiman> sorressean: what kind of asp.net is this? mvc 5? are you using iframes?
[18:22:17] <sorressean> no iframes. I'm not sure how to answer the first question, we were usin .net framework 4.5 and recently upgraded, but this project has been developed/worked on for years. I know some c# but not much about asp.net versioning. we migrated up to .net 4.7.2

[18:23:12] <sorressean> Suchiman:  it's mvc based.
[18:23:25] <Suchiman> sorressean: so Controller classes with .cshtml views
[18:23:51] <sorressean> No, there's an .aspx page, and behind the .aspx page is a .cs file.
[18:23:59] <Suchiman> that's not MVc

[19:06:46] <pandem> difference to europe is the same though, except for two weeks in fall and spring
[19:07:02] <Diablo-D3> its currently -5 because its EST, EDT starts soon, and will be -4

[19:12:50] <lz_> we could also stop the earth from spinning and then all time and dates can finally be constants
[19:13:05] <lz_> that's a ton of optimizations for compilers
[19:13:15] <xb0o2> Y'know I don't think the Earth spinning actually causes time.
[19:13:18] <Diablo-D3> not really? compilers dont care about dates
[19:13:26] <Diablo-D3> xb0o2: technically nothing does
[19:13:33] <Diablo-D3> we actually had to define time first before we could use it
[19:13:47] <Diablo-D3> we somehow settled on seconds as the base unit, which is okay
[19:13:47] <lz_> Diablo-D3: if (date > blabla) <= this would be optimized and replaced by "if (true)" or "if (false)"
[19:13:55] <Diablo-D3> lz_: well no, we do that now
[19:14:09] <Diablo-D3> oh, you mean literally that
[19:14:12] <Diablo-D3> so its either time or isnt time
[19:14:25] <Diablo-D3> time becomes a boolean
[19:14:35] <lz_> no, time becomes a constant (depending on your timezone though)
[19:14:52] <Diablo-D3> so its always jan 1st 1970?
[19:14:54] <lz_> things are either out of date or they aren't, but they stay that way
[19:14:58] <lz_> for example yeah
[19:15:03] <Diablo-D3> lolwat.
[19:15:07] <lz_> but for that we also need to stop the earth from rotating around the sun

[19:15:16] <Diablo-D3> in reality, all times are expressed in seconds
[19:15:17] <lz_> which is a bit more risky because then we'd fall to the sun
[19:15:22] <xb0o2> Have you taken something today lz_?
[19:15:27] <lz_> xb0o2: sadly no
[19:15:41] <Diablo-D3> days, months, years, etc, are all expressed in offsets of seconds because anything bigger is non-continuous and non-monotonic
[19:16:03] <Diablo-D3> "real people time" doesnt have to deal with non-monotonic and non-continuous seconds, and is the realm of special use things like UT1

[19:35:44] <Suchiman> jamea: you need to use something like httpClient2.PostAsync and then pass the url where it's to be posted to and then use something like MultipartFormDataContent that will be sent as the second parameter for PostAsync and in that Multipart you can .Add
[19:38:37] <jamea> ok, reading
[19:39:30] <jamea> suchiman: i try upload 1 file... with post HttpResponseMessage response4 = await httpClient2.PutAsync("http://" + xDirIp + ":" + xPuerto + "/ISAPI/AccessControl/UserInfo/SetUp?format=json", new StringContent(xISAPIParamtersJSON3));   something?
[19:40:37] <Suchiman> jamea: depends on the expected format, if the content is just the raw file, then yes, ByteArrayContent for something like a jpeg, if they expect a form post file upload then Multipart
[19:41:11] <jamea> i try base64 but not... is not the way
[19:42:19] <jamea> and 2: the methos would be POST
[19:55:01] <alguien> You know what I think? A .cs file should never open so that using-s are visible. It should always skip them, maybe even the namespace. If I _really_ want to see what's being used, I can scroll

[20:06:49] <hseg> implementing explicitly doesn't work -- trying to call the explicit implementation complains that I need an object reference
[20:06:57] <hseg> maybe I'm not spelling it right?
[20:08:03] <hseg> "An explicit interface implementation doesn't have an access modifier since it isn't accessible as a member of the type it's defined in. Instead, it's only accessible when called through an instance of the interface."
[20:08:22] <hseg> so iiuc, i'd need a cast anyway, not worth the change
[20:08:59] <hseg> _am_ using explicit implementations since for classes implementing IGet at multiple types, you need them to make the instances legal
[20:09:07] <DevJohnC> why would you need a cast?
[20:09:22] <hseg> to access an explicit implementation?
[20:09:40] <DevJohnC> if you know you have IGet<int> you can call Get(), if you know you have C you can call GetInt() or w/e you desire to name it
[20:11:59] <hseg> what I have is C : IGet<Cat> and I want it to implement IGet<IAnimal> by upcasting the IGet<Cat> instance
[20:12:48] <hseg> however, this means I have multiple, ambiguous Get() functions in C
[20:13:49] <hseg> so I need to cast to IGet<Cat> to restrict to a specific Get_Alloc in any case
