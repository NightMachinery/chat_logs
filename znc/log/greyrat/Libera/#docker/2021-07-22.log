[16:42:19] <wez> gg
[16:44:40] <bailsman> tokko95: that's an interesting use case. What if you leave them in, then run the intermediate container to copy them to a volume, and then build a new image from the intermediate container that removes the files?
[16:45:29] <bailsman> making sure that the intermediate image gets destroyed and never pushed to a registry
[16:45:46] <wez> Yeah you can do that using FROM bleh AS blah
[16:49:23] <tokko> bailsman, I just got the current solution working and had a space to think it more and came into the same idea, that I could break the build in to the two completely separated stages. I'm quite new to docker builds and our current system (that I haven't worked with before) is just one docker build command with a dockerfile, so I was only thinking solutions that would look like that.

[16:56:45] <programmerq> glik22â–¸ if you are getting an exec format error, that means the copy of the image you're using has binaries for a different architecture. If you build it locally, the base image is a multiarch image so it'll start with the correct architecture locally and then run through the rest of the build steps just fine (assuming it sticks to commands that aren't grabbing architecture specific things)

[16:57:49] <tabakhase> tokko to some extend thats cause the "host" may not be you, remote-dockering is perfectly possible - and giving "it the power to just burp stuff into your filesystem while docker is running as root" is bit of a uhhhhh :D
[16:57:53] <programmerq> bailsmanâ–¸ run buildkit in rootless mode if you don't want a chance of escape.
[17:00:20] <programmerq> makaraâ–¸ by default when you ask dockerd to stop, it will basically do a 'docker stop' on every container. That causes a SIGTERM to be sent in (or whatever stop signal is defined for each container). The containerized pid1 is expected to do any cleanup and then exit. If the container doesn't exit in a configurable 10 second window, docker sends a SIG_KILL. Once all containers are exited, dockerd
[17:00:22] <programmerq> is done shutting down. That means that you have one or more containers that aren't properly responding to the SIG_TERM and docker is likely sending the SIG_KILL after that 10 second default. Adjust your containers to correctly respond to SIG_TERM in a timely manner.
[17:02:59] *** Joins: ash_worksi (~ash_m@user/ash-m/x-3292451)
[17:03:10] <programmerq> tokkoâ–¸ the entire purpose of a 'docker build' is to create a docker image-- not to create other types of build artifacts. If you do want to output something to the host, you can do that with a docker run. You could have a container that runs a script that produces the build artifact and then outputs it to a directory that is a bind mount. You could also have that script run and make the stdout
[17:03:12] <programmerq> output of the container be the build artifact so you could do docker run --rm ... image > outputfile.tar
[17:04:15] <programmerq> I do something similar when I run unit tests in a cicd pipeline. The unit tests run in a 'docker run'. When the container stops, I use 'docker cp' to copy the junit compatible xml with the test results back out to the cicd system and then I 'docker rm' the stopped container.

[22:34:11] <apteryx> yeah, I thought so, but after remoning --security-opt (since I was already using --privileged), I'm seeing two new build failures, so I'm puzzled.
[22:34:39] <ada_> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration
[22:34:44] <ada_> yeah I don't think you would need it
[22:35:15] <apteryx> one reads as: man: error while loading shared libraries: libmandb-2.8.3.so: cannot open shared object file: Permission denied
[22:35:41] <apteryx> this is is a ubuntu 18.04 container
[22:36:38] <apteryx> the option I removed was: --security-opt apparmor=docker-default

[22:47:34] <programmerq> capabilities and apparmor are different things, so you'd need the --security-opt for apparmor for sure.
