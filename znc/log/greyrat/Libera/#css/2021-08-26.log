[03:11:31] <FunkyBob> hassoon: using divs?
[03:12:33] <hassoon> FunkyBob: yep, many table-rendering frameworks using a table-like layout to display data do not even use the traditional table element, but instead they use nested divs that act like a table with the necessary css style
[03:12:46] <hassoon> it won't hurt if you opt for that approach anyway
[03:13:25] <hassoon> FunkyBob: otherwise you cannot e.g put a checkbock as a sibling of tr's
[03:16:59] <hassoon> otherwise you'll have to manipulate things with js if you opt for an old school table
[03:18:24] <hassoon> ah wait.. you can do it using old school table, of you use nested tables, i mean a whole inner table means one row
[03:19:04] <hassoon> and you'll have one outer table that acts as a container, having one sole tr and one sold td
[03:19:49] <hassoon> then inside that td you use the checkbox approach , each checkbox toggles its table successor

[07:00:55] <wallbroken> do you see the settings gear on the nav bar?
[07:01:10] <wallbroken> if i open it, is not perfectly aligned to the nav bar
[07:01:15] <wallbroken> it's a little overlayed

[07:05:46] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[07:13:18] <Rockwood> o/
[07:13:44] <FunkyBob> erk... that CSS is so disorganised :/
[07:13:59] <FunkyBob> you've got styling attached and expressed for all the wrong reasons
[07:14:28] <FunkyBob> like you've attached float: left; to .dropdown... but it's not because it's a dropdown it needs floating, it's because it's a navbar item.
[07:14:51] <FunkyBob> but instead of having your CSS say "all items in a navbar should float left"... you just jam it onto unrelated classes.
[07:22:47] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: the problem is that i can't break things now
[07:23:02] <FunkyBob> you keep saying that
[07:23:12] <FunkyBob> it makes me think you don't know what software development is.
[07:23:53] <FunkyBob> "This is broken." "Ok, to fix it you need to change things." "But I can't break stuff" .... but it's already broken...
[07:23:55] <wallbroken> well, to reduce the problem i used this: style="font-size: 90%;"
[07:24:06] <wallbroken> well, let's start from the beginning:
[07:24:22] <wallbroken> the reason which generates the problem is the gear ascii character
[07:24:23] <FunkyBob> "Waiter! Bring me some more technical debt, please!"
[07:24:35] <wallbroken> if i use that character, the navbar increases
[07:24:45] <wallbroken> and it happens ONLY if i use that character
[07:24:55] <wallbroken> if i do use another one, the nav bar keeps the same
[07:24:56] <FunkyBob> so don't use a character? use an image?
[07:25:05] <FunkyBob> can more reliably size, say, a SVG
[07:25:09] <wallbroken> so to reduce the problem i sued: style="font-size: 90%;"
[07:25:20] <wallbroken> but that geenerates the dropdown overlay
[07:25:35] <wallbroken> do you know why that character generates that problem?
[07:26:44] <FunkyBob> if I turn off the "font-size: 90%" thing, it all looks fine to me.
[07:26:51] <wallbroken> no
[07:26:56] <FunkyBob> no gap, no alignment issues...
[07:27:09] <wallbroken> you will see the navbar with the black under "reset" button
[07:27:18] <FunkyBob> https://imgur.com/a/Dwv5kFW
[07:27:33] <FunkyBob> oh, yeah, I see that line
[07:27:52] <wallbroken> https://www.dropbox.com/s/apmoln4x56bjx3i/Capttgtgure.PNG?dl=0
[07:28:26] <FunkyBob> setting font-size: 16px; also works...
[07:29:41] <wallbroken> it does not to me
[07:29:48] <FunkyBob> so for some reason the <a> are 20px tall, but the <button> is 20.8

[07:32:43] <wallbroken> but if i change character instead of gear
[07:32:47] <wallbroken> the problem is not happening
[07:32:57] <FunkyBob> yes... characters aren't uniformly sized.
[07:35:08] <wallbroken> font-size: 15px
[07:35:16] <wallbroken> looks like with this value, it gets fixed
[07:35:23] <wallbroken> why in your case it is 16px?
[07:36:00] <FunkyBob> because (a) my system uses a different implementation of the font, (b) my system uses a different font rendering engine, (c) maybe I'm using a different zoom level
[07:36:07] <FunkyBob> (d) maybe I'm using a different browser
[07:36:45] <oksushi> just use <svg>
[07:37:32] <FunkyBob> that was my suggestion
[07:39:33] <wallbroken> and where to get the svg image?
[07:39:49] <FunkyBob> i find icomoon is a useful resource
[07:43:27] <wallbroken> what's the syntax to add the svg file?
[07:48:27] <FunkyBob> literally embed a <svg> element
[07:48:40] <FunkyBob> or use img
[07:48:46] <FunkyBob> am quite sure icomoon has documentation
[07:49:28] <wallbroken> do you have an example?
[07:49:34] <wallbroken> i downloaded a .svg file
[07:51:08] <oksushi> wallbroken: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web
[07:52:01] <wallbroken> <img
[07:52:04] <wallbroken> it uses img tag
[07:52:14] <wallbroken> not svg, to embed the .svg file
[07:52:23] <FunkyBob> 02:34 < FunkyBob> or use img
[07:53:33] <wallbroken> but with img i can't define the image size
[07:55:08] <oksushi> read the article — there are multiple methods wallbroken
[07:56:47] <wallbroken> i should also specify a color
[07:56:54] <wallbroken> because the default svg color is black
[07:56:57] <wallbroken> but i need it white
[07:57:20] <wallbroken> <img width="16" height="16" src="{% static 'gear_icon.svg' %}">
[07:57:26] <wallbroken> is this what i used at this time

[10:15:38] <FunkyBob> you can't just like with other image formats
[10:15:58] <wallbroken> bad news
[10:16:57] <FunkyBob> if you want to control the styles, you will need to inline it
[10:17:54] <wallbroken> can you show me how?
[10:18:03] <wallbroken>  <img style="fill:red" width="16" height="16" src="{% static 'gear_icon.svg' %}">
[10:18:08] <wallbroken> i tried "fill"
[10:18:11] <wallbroken> but no effect
[10:28:06] <AMcBain> wallbroken, given the {% static, I'm thinking you're using some kind of django templates? I created and use this: http://paste.asmcbain.net/4e0bbe7e/edit#html I saved it as a file under templates/tags/icon.html
[10:28:15] <AMcBain> To use it, a template just has to have: {% include 'tags/icon.html' with name='gear-fill' %}
[10:28:28] <AMcBain> This works well for things like Bootstrap's single SVG "sprite sheet"-equivalent file.
[10:29:00] <AMcBain> Those files define their contents like this: <svg><symbol viewBox="0 0 100 100" fill="currentColor" id="round" ...
[10:29:08] <AMcBain> So every icon is a symbol.
[10:29:20] <AMcBain> Of course I omitted many of the attributes required on the <svg> tag there.
[10:29:43] <wallbroken> AMcBain: can you show me a real complete example please?
[10:29:45] <AMcBain> Also one advantage of having all your icons in one file means one download.
[10:30:10] <AMcBain> wallbroken, not without spinning up an entire django miniapp. I think you can do that on your own. ;)
[10:30:44] <AMcBain> None of this is special. It just uses their "{% include" feature to include a template in another template. That's all.
[10:31:56] <AMcBain> I basically took what they show here: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#install enhanced it with aria stuff, and turned it into an includable template. That's it.
[10:32:08] <AMcBain> The "bootstrap-icons.svg" file is from their download ZIP.
[10:34:06] <AMcBain> The advantage of symbols is that you can pass through things like style-affecting CSS.
[10:39:25] <wallbroken> well, i need to specify the width="15" height="15"
[10:39:27] <wallbroken> also here
[10:39:42] <wallbroken> so i go back to the original problem
[10:39:53] <wallbroken> that different browser can render differently
[10:43:16] <AMcBain> You can put things like 1em in there, etc. Doesn't have to be straight numbers.
[10:43:31] <AMcBain> Also what do you mean "that different browser can render differently"? They all conform to the SVG spec.
[10:43:39] <AMcBain> This is SVG all the way down, rather than <img>

[15:46:09] <oksushi> better to add a class though unless the styling pertains to the link itself
[15:46:29] <diverdude> oksushi: i cannot add neither class nor id :(
[15:46:37] <diverdude> i cannot change the source code basically
[15:48:23] <oksushi> you may need to escape that beginning slash
[15:49:04] <oksushi> actually no — it works just fine https://codepen.io/oksushi/pen/JjJddmX
[15:49:13] <diverdude> hmm yes

[16:14:15] <diverdude> sorry, i lost connection
[16:14:20] <diverdude> and yeah that worked
[16:15:14] <diverdude> I am now trying to find a span with some text, and i am doing: span:contains("Coagulation") but that does not seem to work...is there any other way to find a span tag containing some specific text?
[16:17:13] <oksushi> no
[16:17:25] <oksushi> you can’t search for text nodes in CSS
[16:17:45] <diverdude> i see
[16:19:19] <undefined_bob> I think you can do it with js/jq but its messy
[16:20:03] <undefined_bob> what is your goal? What you wanna do with the found text?

[17:16:30] <wombawomba> I have a table cell that spans a whole row (colspan=6), width 100% and padding 5px, that's making my table overflow it's parent container. How can I get it to not do this?
[17:16:44] <wombawomba> Removing the padding fixes it, but I don't want to do that
[17:20:07] <wombawomba> Okay, solved it using `max-width: calc(100% - 2 * $padding_amount)` on the table cell's child. Still, would like to know if there's a cleaner way
[17:20:51] <wombawomba> Welp okay nevermind, I figured it out.

[19:46:34] <michigan> Hello! How does one horizontally and vertically center a pseudo :before background image inside its container? And could I use flexbox to simplify it? https://jsfiddle.net/w7tjsuh2/ - been googling for hours can't find a decent answer, is it not advised to display icons this way?

[19:51:25] <michigan> I've tried `top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(50%, 50%);`on the :before...
[19:53:32] <michigan> Note that the background image is a sprite
