[04:34:16] <feral_hedgehog> It is ^_^
[04:34:23] <feral_hedgehog> I was just wondering whether there's a way to make systemd automatically configure these parameters instead of manually passing them to the kernel.
[04:34:25] <feral_hedgehog> Like how you can set the correct PARTUUID and have systemd mount everything on the correct mount point and not have to worry about editing fstab and passing the correct root= kernel parameter.
[04:34:28] <jkc> swapfiles aren't partitions, so it would be hard for a partition discovery mechanism to find something that's not a partition.
[04:34:34] *** Quits: obale (~obale@user/obale) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[04:35:05] <jkc> And that's just what you have to deal with when resuming from a file instead of a partition.

[08:48:17] <chaseleif> perrierjouet: you should be careful
[08:49:11] <chaseleif> "pip list" will show you what you have, "pip uninstall" can remove things
[08:50:00] <chaseleif> what I do, when I ever want to pip install something .... I do "python -m venv venv" then "source venv/bin/activate" ... then I use pip
[08:50:13] <chaseleif> When you want to get rid of it just rm -rf the venv/
[08:52:13] <technoturnovers> oh wow
[08:52:24] <technoturnovers> razer's firmware has the secure boot key management settings hidden
[08:52:43] <JTL> o_O
[08:53:20] <chaseleif> sounds legit :)
[08:54:17] <technoturnovers> I mean, this isn't actually a dealbreaker for me, since I'm a pleb anyways and this laptop was my best option quality wise
[08:54:26] <technoturnovers> but that's still pretty scummy
[08:54:52] <technoturnovers> someone made a guide to modify the firmware to reveal the hidden options, but obviously going into your UEFI with a hex editor is pretty shady
[08:55:43] <technoturnovers> oh and also
[08:56:01] <technoturnovers> apparently, for the person who made that guide, the PK they got shipped with was the fucking development key
[08:56:06] <technoturnovers> AKA, the unsecure one
[08:56:15] <JTL> lololol
[08:56:22] <JTL> just another case of OEM incompetence
[08:56:34] <technoturnovers> again, that doesn't really matter to me, since I view secure boot as a shitshow anyways
[08:56:44] <technoturnovers> I only want to deal with secure boot so windows doesn't bitch at me
[08:56:57] <JTL> technoturnovers: I think the only "bulletproof" secure boot system for x86 I've seen is the Xbox One
[08:57:47] <technoturnovers> well yeah, even shim and preloader, the two pre-signed bootloaders everyone uses, have gaping security holes
[08:58:01] <JTL> Because I recall Microsoft at least negotiated a) access to audit the source code of the various third party firmwares and b) they aren't at the mercy of incompetent OEMs for hardware

[09:41:16] <SheWhoExists> AirstrikeIvanov I have used Archiso before and it's pretty easy but it requires a working arch install which I do not presently have. My laptop is on OpenSUSE

[09:42:18] <sheep> is dolphin still kde's file manager?

[09:43:27] <AirstrikeIvanov> yeah i just noticed that

[09:43:43] <sheep> kde-system-meta depends on it

[13:28:09] <Edu4rdSHL> pro, I use openvpn
[13:28:45] <pro> Edu4rdSHL: thanks! I'll read the rest about it on the wiki :)
[13:29:51] <ayekat> it depends on the VPN server you're trying to connect to - e.g. openvpn doesn't support IPsec AFAIK
[13:30:16] <NetSysFire> vpn is a very broad subject
[13:30:49] <pro> one sec, I'll ask what kind of vpn server my corpo uses
[13:30:58] <NetSysFire> it can mean you want to proxy all your traffic, maybe you want to only tunnel into net, maybe you are interested in the technologies (e.g openvpn, ipsec, wireguard, openssh etc)
[13:31:34] <ayekat> oh, and in corporative environments, they also like cisco stuff, so chances are you'll end up with some awful AnyConnect thing or whatever
[13:32:13] <ayekat> in the end, on the client side you rarely have the choice of which client to use
[13:32:40] <pro> my office comerade uses anyconnect on windows to connect
[13:32:56] <ayekat> condolences

[15:02:24] <thrice> I think that's only checking the available package db, not what is installed on your system

[15:07:37] <duso> ah interesting. the ones that come up missing dependencies for me are mosty python2 so I am not really that concerned.
[15:08:24] <ayekat> if you have any third-party/custom repositories enabled, that might explain it - apart from that, Arch packages usually shouldn't refer to non-existent packages
[15:09:02] <ayekat> if you're on a derivative distro, that might be different - but then this is not the place to ask :-)

[17:42:56] <bug2000> Is there something like cp -a to copy, but giveup quickly if reading the file is too slow?
[17:43:03] <bug2000> I'm trying to recover stuff from a dying hdd.
[17:44:05] <cmnky> bug2000, just guessing, but I would think that would be a driver setting somewhere, maybe hdparm

[17:45:18] <cmnky> you would want to lower the retry attempt on read failures ... again, I'm guessing this setting exists
[17:45:34] <Namarrgon> if you have dying hdd then copy the whole disk/partition with ddrescue first, then you can use regular cp/etc to copy individualy files off the image
[17:45:55] <cmnky> ^ good advice from Namarrgon

[17:46:44] <cmnky> with minimal seeking, which might create more issues
[17:46:55] <usrnamewastaken> srp I think what is happening is that the zen kernel benefits older machines more than newer. my i5-6300u had a huge bump in performance (according to benchmark) , but my i7-9750h got no increase (according to benchmark) 
[17:47:36] <srp> usrnamewastaken: i definitely notice an increase in performance in disk ops on my end
[17:47:44] <srp> but yeah, i'd imagine older cpus would be better on it

[21:53:32] <orbita> I mean the raw noise source for AMD seems pretty not-random. 
[21:53:50] <niki> semiconductor designers probably have entire cabinets full of designs that failed because they generated random noise instead of working 
[21:54:08] <orbita> BrainDamage: Also I really thought dark current was thermal anyway
[21:55:28] <BrainDamage> orbita:  while the source of generation-recombination effects is thermal, the  resulting effect on the shot noise's intensity is less than linear
[21:55:52] <orbita> BrainDamage: Yeah okay that tracks
[21:56:38] <orbita> But I knew you could surpress it with cryo
[21:56:50] <orbita> So wanted to check
[21:57:00] <BrainDamage> if you reach cryo temps, half of the cpu would also risk to cease to work

[21:57:52] <orbita> I mean the semiconductors change behaviour a lot, I doubt all the transistors would work 
[21:57:56] <BrainDamage> iirc you need something like ~15meV thermal energy to have dopants sufficiently ionized
[21:58:05] <niki> “The entropy source is designed to function properly over a wide range of operating conditions, exceeding the normal operating range of the processor.”
[21:58:22] <BrainDamage> and all the junctions would end up being instead intrinsec semiconductor
[21:58:31] <BrainDamage> so the transistors would cease to be so
[21:59:00] <orbita> Wow this is like a flashback to a lecture I'm sure I had
[21:59:15] <orbita> Classic undergrad lab right there
[21:59:47] <orbita> Cool down this semiconductor and see what happens
[22:00:56] <orbita> What's it called "freeze-out"?
[22:01:02] <BrainDamage> yup
[22:01:50] <BrainDamage> if my 15meV are recalled correctly, it'd make for ~175K
