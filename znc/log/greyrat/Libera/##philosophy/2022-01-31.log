[00:03:11] <yanmaani> I mean, if you have a perfect thought-control machine, it seems quite efficient to just shoot everyone who thinks bad thoughts.
[00:03:21] <ProfSimm> Oh my god.
[00:04:16] <srukle> yanmaani: I think in a practical sense, yes; we cannot punish people without knowing truly what they think. I also find it difficult to imagine what justice could be done regarding punishing people for having thoughts they do not articulate or act on. I could imagine many people have dozens a thoughts they ignore or forget.
[00:04:54] <ProfSimm> I think I'm starting to understand why our politicians are so incompetent if that's the level of philosophy in society about these matters.
[00:05:05] <yanmaani> In the practical sense, sure.
[00:05:37] <yanmaani> But this is only subject to those constraints, then? If you have a pre-crime machine like in the Minority Report, you can round up and arrest people?

[00:19:11] <srukle> I'm not arguing as an apologist for Popper.
[00:19:58] <yanmaani> I mean, my position is much simpler: if your philosophy can only defend itself by the imposition of force, it hasn't the right to exist
[00:20:23] <yanmaani> If people *want* fascism, there's not a whole lot you can do to stop them - yes, you could indeed refuse to give them what they want, but that is to sacrifice democracy for civil rights
[00:20:45] <srukle> You could easily insert ideology in your statement, and it wouldn't change much on how ideologies engage and fight.
[00:20:55] <yanmaani> At that point, you have already lost. That's the situation in Turkey, and it was simply fucked when they embarked on the path of "let's have a military coup every 10 years"
[00:21:18] <yanmaani> yeah definitely. If an ideology can't actually convince people of why it's a good idea, only force people to mouth agreement with it (or else...), it hasn't the right to exist

[00:41:27] <srukle> The simpler solution is to collaborate.
[00:42:11] <Irishmanluke> The costs youre talking about are essentially fixed costs associated with the transition while the benefits would be ongoing
[00:42:21] <srukle> No, I disagree.
[00:43:19] <Irishmanluke> I'm no saying I necessarily think it's a good idea but the argument would be that the ability of both governments to function given that the political gridlock would be broken would lead to far greater efficiency of both governments over he long term
[00:43:42] <srukle> I also disagree.
[00:43:53] <Irishmanluke> go on
[00:44:00] <srukle> The two regions are not that ideologically in opposition.
[00:44:37] <Irishmanluke> what are the main ideological points of contention in the US
[00:44:47] <srukle> It's not a binary where one people think this and another people think that. The people who have lived in these regions still find value living there regardless of governance or ideological fashion that is peddled today. They will not move because of some greater good.
[00:45:33] <srukle> Right -- and your argument actually supports my position that splitting would fail to provide the benefits you say they would have in governance.
[00:45:46] <Irishmanluke> a lot of people are attached to the place they live regardless of ideology that is true
[00:46:18] <Irishmanluke> if the main ideological breaks in the US are not centered around geographical regions it definitely makes the whole idea less tennable
[00:46:56] <Irishmanluke> I think there are a lot of people in the US who are also not tied to the state that they live in as well but that's perhaps a moot point
[00:47:21] <srukle> That's true, I believe 20% of the population moves for employment.
[00:48:46] <srukle> So it's very possible within sometime, if the breakdown of geological borders becomes significant with the trend, a divide of the federal government would be possible. I do not think today it works, as you can see both parties have strong presence throughout. And if we see political parties as markers of ideological differences, then we can assume a geological divide today would not work.
[00:49:10] <Bakunin> thats illegal
[00:49:21] <Irishmanluke> I think you're right that most US states are fairly ideologically mixed, even if he split is 90/10 that makes things a lot more complicated
[00:49:42] <Bakunin> there arent any 90/10 states
[00:49:56] <Bakunin> and republican-democrat is an artificial construct

[01:06:53] <yanmaani> (don't want to paste all of it, and I can't copy/paste from the pdf)
[01:07:10] <srukle> Can you do a past bin?
[01:07:13] <ProfSimm> The problem isn't in how he defines it, rather defining tolerance itself as a social goal. Tolerance means something you're in adversarial relationship with, but which you accept and suffer without counteraction.
[01:07:16] <srukle> paste*
[01:07:40] <ProfSimm> We don't want a tolerant society, we want a society that understands each other and have common goals.
[01:08:22] <ProfSimm> We need to stop talking about tolerance.
[01:08:55] <ProfSimm> And if you define the goal as common goals and understanding, cooperation, suddenly there's no paradox.
[01:09:17] <Irishmanluke> I think when people talk about tolerance with respect to government "accept and suffer without counteraction" simply means we're not going to kill or imprison them
[01:09:24] <Irishmanluke> It doesn't mean hold your tongue
[01:09:39] <Irishmanluke> or try to be friends with them
[01:09:55] <ProfSimm> It can be understood on different levels, but in any case it implies "I don't like this, but I'm not going to take action"

[01:10:17] <LordOfLive> Hi
[01:10:25] <Irishmanluke> well yeah that seems silly, there's always an appropriate level of action that can be taken
[01:10:32] <ProfSimm> Which is very narrow in a sense. It defers the problem, doesn't resolve it
[01:11:30] <ProfSimm> And tolerance towards everything implies basically no society. We cease to be society, we share no goals, no understanding, we're just individuals co-existing.
[01:11:33] *** Joins: I_Am_M00t (uid427178@id-427178.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[01:11:44] <ProfSimm> And the default mode of co-existence is adversarial. Competitive.
[01:13:27] <ProfSimm> The other fallacy discussed earlier was can we draw a sharp line between those we "kill" because they're so evil, and the "good guys". And two users here kept trying to figure out where that painfully sharp line is. Of course, there's no such sharp line.
[01:14:25] <ProfSimm> Logic, math and so on are great abstract models, but trying to reduce everything to false dichotomies because it's logically convenient is just silly.

[01:16:26] <yanmaani> (see pdf link above)
[01:18:21] <Irishmanluke> thanks yanmaani
[01:18:57] <Irishmanluke> I think there's a more limited sense in which the goal of tolerance makes sense
[01:19:33] <Irishmanluke> it means you want to live in a society where a diverse set of life paths are accepted
[01:19:58] <Irishmanluke> not infinitely diverse
[01:25:05] <Delf> Those require lines
[01:25:29] <ProfSimm>  Irishmanluke every "whole" is defined by axioms that are accepted and not questioned, regardless if they're correct or not. At least not carelessly questioned. Axioms that define how we're similar, and how we can be different, what's good and what is bad.
[01:25:41] <ProfSimm> Without these axioms there's no whole, just separates.
[01:26:40] <ProfSimm> And I say axioms, because some people try to claim their ethics and so on are objective. There are no objective ethics.
[01:26:43] <ProfSimm> It's a mirage.
[01:26:59] <ProfSimm> The thing about an axiom is you accept it without proving it's right
[01:27:25] <Irishmanluke> I agree but I also think people lean into the subjectivity of ethics too much.  In reality many ethical disuputes can be resolved by appealing to facts
[01:27:42] <ProfSimm> Ethical disputes through facts?
[01:27:44] <ProfSimm> Hm.
[01:27:50] <ProfSimm> I don't know, for example?
[01:28:31] <Irishmanluke> Well we could start with an easy one.  Is the death penalty ever warranted?
[01:28:53] <ProfSimm> I'm curious what facts you'd bring to resolve this
[01:29:01] <inhahe_> I think facts can come into importance in ethics, but it requires/rests on an underlying agreement of values between both parties.
[01:29:09] <Irishmanluke> If had information that could lead us to answer the question of whether or not the death penatly was an effective deturrant that would resolve it for many pairs of people
[01:29:23] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: yeah I think so also
[01:29:30] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: comes back to shared axioms
[01:29:49] <Irishmanluke> values don't derive from axioms though, utlimately they derive from biology
[01:29:51] <inhahe_> in the case of teh death penalty, one of the parties may just feel that a person 'deserves' death regardless of deterrence
[01:30:00] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: death is a very effective deterrent about the particular person committing crimes again.
[01:30:20] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: so is life in prison
[01:30:31] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: sure, but he can escape prison
[01:30:31] <Irishmanluke> well no as effective perhaps
[01:30:43] <Irishmanluke> or commit crimes while in prison
[01:30:51] <ProfSimm> Yes, another good point
[01:30:58] <ProfSimm> So let's kill people then
[01:30:59] <ProfSimm> :D
[01:31:00] <ProfSimm> jk
[01:31:17] <Irishmanluke> the point is our belief about the death penalty is dependent on a lot of questions about the actual effects of the death penalty
[01:32:57] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[01:33:10] <Delf> What was the crime they committed? Helped his neighbor carry groceries?
[01:33:37] <srukle> Also how the penalty is carried out -- "is it humane?"
[01:33:51] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: it's dependent on our entire model of law enforcement. How it works, what are the goals. But I'm not sure that all lays down on hard facts that resolve the issue directly.
[01:34:15] <Delf> Of course not
[01:34:17] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: yes but I said "in many cases" not in all cases
[01:34:44] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: of course. But when do facts resolve an ethical dispute? Maybe it's not ethical then, but factual.
[01:35:18] <Irishmanluke> nevertheless I think even situations where people say "well that's just my belief" and you may call that belief an axiom, in reality very few beliefs are actually axiomatic but are dependent on other more primary beliefs and on assumptions about the world
[01:36:08] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: everything at its core is an assumption so I guess yeah
[01:36:27] <Bakunin> haha
[01:36:30] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: you could say that but then you're defining the word ethical in such a way that it can never be an objective matter thus making your argument by definition
[01:36:49] <Bakunin> the "truths don't exist" crowd is the same crowd as "what about meta-nazis, they should be ok, right?"
[01:36:56] <Irishmanluke> descriptive assumptions
[01:37:02] <Bakunin> real think mask on some people in this channel :D
[01:37:17] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: I'm open to redefining ethical, if given an example where it's not so clear cut
[01:38:04] <ProfSimm> Bakunin: I was kinda biting my nails, waiting for you to tell me I'm a nazi and here we are
[01:38:15] <ProfSimm> Bakunin: time to kill me
[01:38:27] <Delf> There is objective ethics?

[01:39:22] <ProfSimm> Bakunin: how many of your beliefs are absolute and extreme places a cap on your perception limits.
[01:39:47] <Irishmanluke> The trouble I have with people leaning into the idea of "ethics is subjective" is it leads to a situation where anyone can defend any norm by saying "that's just my belief" but making that statement is to be naive about what beliefs actually are and how hey are formed
[01:39:53] <ProfSimm> Bakunin: it's kinda like trying to blow up the volume on a tiny speaker beyond its capabilities. Everything sounds like noise, or silence
[01:40:35] <ProfSimm> Bakunin: or say everything is about "you're fascist or anti-fascist" :P
[01:40:45] <Delf> What're the troubles you have with objective ethics?
[01:41:25] <srukle> Who is to say what is objectively true?
[01:41:52] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: I don't think ethics should be defined based on free-floating beliefs. Rather it's about what kind of overall mental model you have about a society and what its goals should be, and then you build ethics on top of that premise, consistent with the premise
[01:41:55] *** Quits: yabbes (uid254190@user/yabbes) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:42:17] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: but it it's a fact that the premise is axiomatic. I mean why have something rather than nothing? Kinda can't explain that
[01:43:12] <Delf> The premise can be discussed
[01:43:16] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: why is it nice to have happy children, and people who can express themselves and so on. If we come back to "because happiness is good" I mean it doesn't get more axiomatic and emotion/belief-based than that, does it
[01:43:18] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: can't necessarily explain it but it's obvious from observation
[01:43:46] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: emotion based and belief based are very different though
[01:43:59] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: why is it better to eat than to starve
[01:44:00] <ProfSimm> We have for example environmentalists who think humans suck, and we should basically off ourselves and free up space for animals to thrive.
[01:44:06] <ProfSimm> How would you argue this?
[01:44:21] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: because our biology makes it so obviously, it has nothing to do with beliefs
[01:44:31] <ProfSimm> Our biology makes what?
[01:44:45] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: makes it better to eat than to starve, from our perspective
[01:45:01] <ProfSimm> Oh. Well eating is not a question of ethics I think

[01:45:05] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: I think most of those environmentalists are lying to themselves
[01:45:10] <ProfSimm> Are they?
[01:45:13] <ProfSimm> What if they're right
[01:45:22] <Irishmanluke> right in what sense
[01:45:34] <ProfSimm> We're destroying nature and ourselves, better to destroy ourselves and at least save nature.
[01:45:37] <ProfSimm> Less damage this way
[01:45:43] <Irishmanluke> I mean maybe they are right in the sense that that is an accurate depiction of their preferences
[01:45:44] <ProfSimm> Math checks out
[01:46:39] <Irishmanluke> but all preferences ulitmately stem from biology
[01:46:41] <Delf> We won't die if we improve
[01:46:54] <Irishmanluke> like the preference to eat rather than starve to death
[01:47:03] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: those environmentalists are surely also biological, and came down to self-destruction
[01:47:06] <Delf> We can get better at destroying the nature and ourselves :P
[01:47:14] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: yes
[01:47:29] <ProfSimm> Delf: we should master space travel and destroy other planets
[01:47:29] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: and odd choice but our biology is fairly complex
[01:47:36] <Bakunin> "environmentalists are lying to themselves?"
[01:47:39] <Delf> ProfSimm: Hahahh... lets not :)
[01:47:51] <Bakunin> super hot take
[01:48:15] <Bakunin> post some Republican/Authoritarian environmental analysis please, Irishmanluke
[01:48:17] <ProfSimm> Theory being if we spread our destruction more thin across the universe, we'd have less capacity to finish off Earth
[01:49:02] <Irishmanluke> Bakunin: kill me
[01:49:05] <Delf> With space travel, the destruction gets a whole lot thicker, don't you think?
[01:49:27] <Bakunin> that's a weird version of "environmentalism"
[01:49:33] <Bakunin> u doin a sock puppet account now?
[01:49:39] <ProfSimm> Anyway, I don't side with said hypothetical environmentalists or against them, I was illustrating that we need a premise upon which we build ethics, and the premise is kinda axiomatic.
[01:49:44] <Bakunin> you forgot to switch clients
[01:50:10] <Irishmanluke> and those axioms derive from our preferences which are biologically determined
[01:50:26] <ProfSimm> Bakunin: I posed the question, so I guess I'm the Russian Troll Farm Sock Puppet Conspiracy or whatever
[01:51:23] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: well yes, but look, we're not animals, 90% of our brain is neocortex which is generic structures self-trained over our lifetime. I.e. we have more mental flexibility than any other animal. We think well beyond hungry/sleepy/thirsty/fucky.
[01:51:51] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: this means we can come up with smarter ideas, and also much dumber ones, than say a rabbit would
[01:52:11] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: sure that allows us to come up with more complex strategies for passing on our genetic information
[01:52:22] <Delf> The structure must be built in alignment with our values, not your values :P
[01:52:30] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: or coming up with strategies not to pass our genetic information
[01:52:41] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: the more developed a society, the less children per family
[01:53:00] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: well the second statement is much easier to explain
[01:53:12] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: from an evolutionary framework
[01:53:14] <ProfSimm> Well we can explain it, but the fact remains
[01:53:45] <Delf> What if all our thoughts are merely extensions of those?
[01:54:10] <Bakunin> Delf if one talks to oneself all day on a philo channel using sockpuppets, there's no real difference between "we" and "me"
[01:54:11] <Bakunin> :)
[01:54:32] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: In a developed society where our children have higher probabilities of living until reproducing age and reproducing themselves it makes more sense to invest more time an energy into a smaller number of children
[01:55:09] <ProfSimm> I'm ready to admit, Bakunin is my sock puppet.
[01:55:47] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: you have a rich inner life
[01:56:39] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: I've heard the usual range of explanations, but if it was all about child mortality, we wouldn't have collapsing demographics on developed countries, and booming demographics on developing ones
[01:57:00] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: we're not merely compensating for low child mortality
[01:57:11] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: we're literally terrified of having children en masse.
[01:57:19] <ProfSimm> Which is a very interesting thing socially.
[01:57:43] <Bakunin> fascinating peers on the border too
[01:57:52] <ProfSimm> Education is expensive and so on and so on. Sure. But do families with 10 children in a developing nations have enough about college?
[01:57:52] <ProfSimm> No
[01:57:56] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: maybe that's based on an accurate assessment of our limited supply of resources?
[01:58:44] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: And our limited supply of resources will, hilariously, grow even more limited as demographics collapse.
[01:59:04] <Irishmanluke> It's also possible the decisions we are making are no evolutionarily optimal, evolution is not a perfect process
[01:59:12] <Irishmanluke> *not
[01:59:44] <ProfSimm> Maybe it's part of the evolutionary process that when you're smart enough and you see you're destroying your entire habitat, you think "wow, my entire species is a mistake that needs to end"
[01:59:44] <ProfSimm> :D
[02:00:05] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: well that's a small number of people
[02:00:12] <Delf> No, ProfSimm, we're not that smart
[02:00:29] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: and out of those people I only believe the ones that have actually tried to make the end of the species happen
[02:00:38] <ProfSimm> It is a small number of people yes, as most people are busy talking gossips and politics and sports and fucking around
[02:01:04] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: Unabomber was Right (TM)
[02:01:05] <ProfSimm> ;-)
[02:01:17] <ProfSimm> Anyway, I didn't mean to focus that much on this, but I find it funny :P
[02:01:29] <ProfSimm> So what's an objective fact that determines correct ethics/
[02:02:13] <Irishmanluke> Well in general in my model it's a question of whether or not something is correct from the perspecive of the individual, there will always be some inherent conflicts between individuals
[02:02:43] <Bakunin> citation:  <Irishmanluke> Bakunin: kill me
[02:03:15] <Delf> Don't listen to them
[02:03:26] <Irishmanluke> The question is whether or not a given belief is an accurate expression of the individuals ingrained biological preferences or not
[02:04:01] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: all our decisions are ultimately probabilistic. We have a saying "good things cause bad things and bad things cause good things", I don't know how to translate it.
[02:04:03] <Irishmanluke> which it could easily not be if they don't understand themselves or they don't understand the world well enough to have a good grasp of the effect of that belief
[02:04:38] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: that's a problem that all our formal models are abstract and absolute and therefore you have absolute truth in them. But there's no absolute truth outside them. We're guessing.
[02:04:54] <ProfSimm> I.e. according to math 2 + 2 is 4, and that's that.
[02:05:17] <Irishmanluke> well you clearly haven't heard of the Peano axioms
[02:05:42] <ProfSimm> In the real world occasionally you get 2+2 = 3 or 2 + 2 = 5 if you count cells during apoptosis or mitosis :P
[02:06:26] <Irishmanluke> we're always guessing but guesses that are based on observation are better than ones that are based on nothing
[02:06:37] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: of course.
[02:06:44] <Irishmanluke> math is free from guessing but it also doesn't make statements about the world
[02:06:50] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: just as long as we understand observations have a subjective component
[02:06:59] <Bakunin> it does.
[02:07:13] <Irishmanluke> in the sense that I can only observe something from within the context of my own consciousness
[02:07:17] <ProfSimm> Bakunin can use math to determine who's a fascist.
[02:07:27] <Irishmanluke> subjective oesn't mean arbitrary though
[02:07:34] <Bakunin> 3 = 19
[02:08:01] <Irishmanluke> the point I was trying to make is that you can prove that 2+2=4 if you start from definitions and a formal axiomatization of arithmetic
[02:08:15] <Irishmanluke> you have to define 2,+,=, and 4
[02:08:25] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: eh sure, we have axioms
[02:08:31] <ProfSimm> As noted all models do
[02:08:40] <Irishmanluke> axioms in math are different from axioms in physics or philosophy
[02:08:51] <ProfSimm> Are they
[02:08:53] <Irishmanluke> yes
[02:08:59] <ProfSimm> Ok in what way
[02:09:47] <Irishmanluke> an axiom in math isn't really a statement about reality but rather just a set of preconditions for the theorems that you are about to make.  In other words you're saying "an object like the one I'm describing might not exist in reality but assuming that we have an object that has the following properties then we can say this about it"
[02:11:44] <Irishmanluke> this is my perspective I'm not claiming to represent mathemticians in general
[02:13:05] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: that's how I understand axiom in all contexts
[02:13:12] <Irishmanluke> This interpretation really helps us to understand the meaning of statements which are indepenedent of a given axiomitizaion though like the continuum hypothesis vis a via ZFC
[02:13:25] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: it's an idea we decide to accept. Because we decide it's useful to accept it
[02:13:28] <ProfSimm> For the model
[02:13:37] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: no I don't think I'm being clear
[02:13:37] <ProfSimm> A rule, rather
[02:13:45] <ProfSimm> Like in Game of Life's rules
[02:14:11] <ProfSimm> OK sorry
[02:14:58] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: mathematical axioms don't have any truth value at all and the value of the theory isn't dependent on them being true or false because in general they are true in some specific context in reality
[02:16:03] *** Joins: Toadisattva (~Toadisatt@gateway/tor-sasl/toadisattva)
[02:16:05] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: for example whether or not 2 + 2 = 4 in reality could be dependent on whether or not the thing that we are counting adheres to a specific set of arithmetical exioms
[02:16:27] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: obviously there are many things in reality that more or less do adhere to those axioms
[02:17:12] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: a model does rely on its axioms in proofs, doesn't it.
[02:17:22] <ProfSimm> I may not need to but it may need to
[02:17:29] <ProfSimm> Either directly or indirectly.
[02:17:38] <Irishmanluke> sure but mathematical statements aren't statements about reality
[02:17:45] <ProfSimm> No one said they are
[02:18:11] <Irishmanluke> if anything what they really are are statements about any set of objects which adheres to the mathematical axioms as they have previously been stated

[02:19:57] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: we have no access to "reality" in general.

[02:22:31] <Irishmanluke> a physical axiom would be an actual positive statement about how the world works and there's actually an objective answer to whether or not that axiom is true (regardless of whether or no we will ever be able to know what the answer is)
[02:22:38] <Delf> Think of reality being a symbolic link
[02:23:09] <Bakunin> thats math
[02:23:11] <Irishmanluke> a mathemetical axiom is not
[02:23:43] <Irishmanluke> there is no objective truth or falsehood to mathematical axioms because they are not statements about the world
[02:24:04] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: I've not seen such a definition of an axiom before. "Physical". The definition is usually a rule accept without prove, and build upon it. I mean how would we figure out "physical axioms" at all. No one has a firm grasp of absolute reality
[02:24:44] <Irishmanluke> that's changing the subject to epistemology
[02:24:45] <Bakunin> they are

[02:27:37] <Irishmanluke> lol
[02:28:18] <Irishmanluke> if the virtual machine you're running is a model of reality though then it still stands that your axiom in reality can actually be true or false
[02:28:21] <ProfSimm> Sorry is implemented in the virtual machine via quantum micro-tubules or whatever Penrose claims qualia comes from :P
[02:28:51] <Irishmanluke> qualia exist axiomatically
[02:29:11] <Irishmanluke> that's obvious
[02:29:18] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: technically all models are aspects of reality. Math is abstract, but it's intended to be helpful when mapped to reality in particular ways. The other models may seem more observational, more concrete, but it's a gradation, not a boolean flag
[02:29:39] <Irishmanluke> "when mapped in particular ways", everything hinges on that
[02:29:44] <ProfSimm> Of course
[02:30:03] <Irishmanluke> well the truth of it is entirely dependent on the mapping
[02:30:30] <ProfSimm> Hence why I kind of wince when someone talks about objective truths, or reality, and so on, because technically all we see are projections from models.
[02:30:34] <Irishmanluke> and given that the flexibility in terms of the number of possible mappings it's reasonable to assume that for most mathematical theories there is a mapping that makes them true
[02:30:45] <ProfSimm> Models projected from models, projected from models, etc. etc. projected from input sensory data streams
[02:31:07] <ProfSimm> We're neck deep in models.
[02:31:08] <Irishmanluke> sure but that's changing the subject to epsitemology again
[02:31:24] <Irishmanluke> the question isn't whether or not we have access to objective reality but whether or not it exists
[02:31:26] <ProfSimm> Well OK, you lead the subject for a while then
[02:31:40] <ProfSimm> Whether it exists?
[02:31:44] <ProfSimm> Hmm
[02:31:59] <ProfSimm> How can we talk about whether 'it' exists, if we don't know what 'it' is?
[02:32:27] <ProfSimm> Big brain time ;-)
[02:32:30] <Delf> Maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't....
[02:32:43] <Delf> What difference does it make when all we have is our own limitations
[02:32:53] <Irishmanluke> we know what the concept of objective reality is
[02:33:31] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: we know what the concept of "infinity" in math is, as well, but does it exist?
[02:33:34] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: unknown
[02:34:18] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: some concepts we have in our head are like the "default" statement of a switch case.
[02:34:27] <Irishmanluke> there are a number of different infinities in mathematics but I'm just being pedantic now aren't I
[02:34:32] <Delf> It's a nice concept indeed, practical and such, especially when you get stuck in a delusion or thousands... nice tool to navigate with
[02:34:44] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: "what do we call the thing that's all things ever as they are" "default: objective reality"
[02:35:03] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: nah i know there are. But we don't know if any of them exist :P
[02:35:45] <ProfSimm> It's easy to define the set of all natural numbers.
[02:35:54] <ProfSimm> Outright impossible to find them somewhere in nature
[02:36:11] <ProfSimm> Even if we saw an infinity, we can't prove it is infinity as we'd have to count infinite time to prove it :P

[02:36:57] <Delf> That doesn't mean we can't prove it. It just says we need to count forever... to prove it
[02:37:20] <Delf> It's possible but the method of reaching proof is not adequate
[02:38:20] <Irishmanluke> actually now that you mention it I'd be really surpised if questions about ordinal and cardinal numbers had any applications
[02:39:01] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: they may, just like sqrt(-1) turned out to have many applications.
[02:39:13] <Irishmanluke> I guess the argument for doing some types of mathematics is that it's aesthetic but it's only aesthetic to the very small number of people who can understand which are the ones who are getting the grant money to do it
[02:39:43] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: our formal models always kinda peak beyond physical possibility, before they can return at a different approach angle and reveal another dimension of the model
[02:39:57] <Irishmanluke> less surprising that complex numbers are useful though
[02:40:26] <Irishmanluke> obviously I'm biased by living long after they were invented and knowing history
[02:40:26] <ProfSimm> I don't know is it. I still can't wrap my head on the implications of sqrt(-1) being so useful. Coincidence/
[02:40:29] <Irishmanluke> still
[02:40:56] <ProfSimm> Sum of squares in nature tend to all look like complex planes
[02:41:15] <Irishmanluke> it allows you to create a field for which the real numbers are a subfield but one which is closed under all algebraic operations
[02:41:15] <ProfSimm> X dimension is sum dimension, and Y dimension is product dimension
[02:41:31] <Irishmanluke> it's useful for proving theorems about the real numbers mainly (not only)
[02:42:07] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: it'd be very interesting how much of math aliens found as well convergently.
[02:42:17] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: unfortunately maybe we won't find out in this life
[02:43:14] <Irishmanluke> Irishmanluke: I think about this sometimes.  People often say mathematics is the universal language by which we'll be able to initially communicate with extraterrestrial intelligent life but I'm not so convinced, maybe their mathetematics will be completely different from ours
[02:43:22] <Delf> Hahhah
[02:43:33] <Irishmanluke> maybe their brain works in such a way that they don't have a lo of use for numbers
[02:44:04] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: I'm also not convinced.

[02:54:29] <ProfSimm> Why assume there's aliens invading us
[02:54:46] <Irishmanluke> because of the prime directive
[02:54:59] <Bakunin> theres spaceships, but they're more likely to be US gov or humans from the future
[02:55:03] <Delf> Right, I forgot, Irishmanluke
[02:55:47] <ProfSimm> "Invading aliens" is a very human-like projection. If aliens want to be hostile they won't just invade us for the territory. They have clearly a whole galaxy to play with if they could come from light years away
[02:55:58] <Delf> Why is there a prime directive? And who the fuck invented it? The vulcans or us?
[02:56:06] <ProfSimm> They may be grooming us to be slaves or something. But then they wouldn't just invade us
[02:56:10] <Irishmanluke> maybe other intelligent life exits in the universe but it's rare enough that two civilizations will never travel far enough to meet each other
[02:56:24] <Irishmanluke> that thought always makes me kind of sad
[02:56:39] <Delf> How rare is it that we're here?
[02:56:47] <ProfSimm> I think there's a good chance some of the UAP reports may be extraterrestrial or extra uhmm dimensional (?) craft.
[02:57:18] <ProfSimm> But there's a great reason this is not widely publicized because most people will freak the fuck out.
[02:57:26] <Irishmanluke> they're hiding at a different point on the w axis lol
[02:57:39] <ProfSimm> Is it that funny :P
[02:57:41] <Irishmanluke> because we live in the x,y,z hyperplane
[02:57:52] <Irishmanluke> so extra-dimensional aliens must be hiding in w

[03:00:43] <Delf> Why is it inevitable?
[03:01:28] <ProfSimm> Well, the default state of co-existence is adversarial competition. We used to be in balance with nature like most animals, but our technological/industrial revolution is now literally competing with nature.
[03:01:54] <ProfSimm> It's the default state. Our technology just threw us out of balance, it was inevitable.
[03:02:05] <Irishmanluke> what about collective self-preservation kicking in
[03:02:08] <ProfSimm> So the hope is we find a new balance, otherwise we're fucked

[03:05:36] <ProfSimm> Everyone is individually chasing their own goals, but as a whole the system has an emergent different goal.
[03:05:44] <Delf> That was never the point, was it?
[03:05:48] <ProfSimm> And it's behaving like a mold taking over everything
[03:06:20] <Delf> I mean, the system is for us to be controlled, not the other way around
[03:06:44] <ProfSimm> Delf: well is it the technology or the system it allows us to build is a bit a chicken-egg situation.

[03:15:15] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: ah man I wish I knew more about physics, I probably don't have any useful takes here
[03:15:21] <Irishmanluke> I don't even understand relativity
[03:15:58] * Delf likes to philosophize at very superficial levels
[03:16:10] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: well I'll give you a shortcut to understand it then. Imagine every single particle at all, moves always at speed C. Always. The only thing different between particles is their rotation vector in 3D x y z w space
[03:16:13] <ProfSimm> Sorry 4D
[03:16:48] <Irishmanluke> is w standing in for time here?
[03:17:05] <ProfSimm> This is why as you start moving you "turn away" from w, which is time-like dimension because we move at C speed at it. So the faster you move in x y z, the slower you move in w, therefore time dilation and length contraction
[03:17:40] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: it's standing in for time, but not because it's time, but because we're moving at speed C in it. If you start moving near speed C along x/y/z  then that vector will be your time
[03:17:45] <ProfSimm> And W will be purely space
[03:17:52] <ProfSimm> That's the mindfuckery :P
[03:18:32] <Delf> Unable to grasp it
[03:18:48] <ProfSimm> Essentially it's 4D space, but because we're moving always at speed C in *some* direction, one of the dimension contracts to nothing.
[03:18:49] <Irishmanluke> how is it that the order of events is subjective
[03:19:13] <ProfSimm> And we experience the other 3 dimensions as spatial
[03:19:58] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: the order is not subjective, but "the news" of events may come out of order. The causal order is never broken locally
[03:20:25] <inhahe_> wouldn't the causal order be broken if you had a tachyon gun?
[03:20:41] <ProfSimm> Well as far as we know. I mean we'll be discovering a lot more after Einstein yet.
[03:21:05] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: well, those are hypothetical
[03:21:35] <ProfSimm> inhahe: entanglement may have some way of breaking causality but we've not found it yet
[03:22:39] <ProfSimm> More specifically, there was a paper that models entanglement as a stretch in timespace, where effect-antieffect as perceived as cause-effect or effect-cause by both particles testing both entangled properties
[03:23:15] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: Have you ever lookekd at this https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/ ?
[03:23:16] <ro-bot-o> [url] Finally We May Have a Path to the Fundamental Theory of Physics‚Ä¶ and It‚Äôs Beautiful‚ÄîStephen Wolfram Writings | writings.stephenwolfram.com
[03:23:16] <ProfSimm> Which would imply there's no cause and effect, there's just effect-antieffect in entanglement, and causality is an illusion our mind builds depending on which we see first
[03:24:03] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: I have but unfortunately he's still sweating on building something useful out of it
[03:24:21] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: it's a bit like string theory, it's too broad/general to make specific predictions
[03:24:31] <ProfSimm> You can configure it to make any universe at all.
[03:25:56] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: I am skeptical of theories that are too broad like this because essentially it's a template for a theory rather than a theory and the question is how useful is that? Couldn't there be potentially an infinite number of possible templates for which there exists an instantation within them which is a correct fundamental theory of physics?
[03:26:26] <Irishmanluke> how hard is it to create a language which is broad enough that it can basically represent any possible physical theory
[03:27:26] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: it's quite possible the fundamental theory of reality would be broad and highly parametric like this. There may be a multiverse of all kinds of permuations of physics in there. But yes, it's too early for this. Wolfram may be right, but his theory may be too early in time for us. It's not the next step. It's like 100 steps beyond.
[03:28:01] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: he's hoping to narrow things down until he has predictions to test.
[03:28:29] <Irishmanluke> Isn't the existence of the multiverse an unknowable unknown.  It seems like it would make more sense to focus on this universe
[03:29:00] <ProfSimm> Well. We gotta keep it mind. But sure, the focus should be on this one
[03:29:20] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: it's possible the multiverse may not be very far, too. It may literally be around us.
[03:29:22] <Irishmanluke> It would be interesting if he could narrow it down to set of candidates which all are able to recover all known physics
[03:29:27] *** bosspotato_ is now known as bosspotato
[03:30:20] <Irishmanluke> Maybe within his theory here's even more than one correct candidae
[03:31:06] <Irishmanluke> Maybe there are candidates that are correct but also include unnecessary complexity
[03:32:15] <Irishmanluke> Given that it's essentially all mathematics doesn't the correctness actually hinge on the particular mapping to reality
[03:33:37] <Irishmanluke> Do we know what happens if an object were to walk off the edge of space? Is that possible to do?
[03:35:57] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: we don't know what the edge of space is
[03:36:17] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: my working thesis is that it's the 3-sphere surface of a 4D blackhole
[03:36:37] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: which means it's like Earth, you can walk in a straight line forever, you'll neve fall off the edge of Earth
[03:37:24] <Irishmanluke> meaning there is no edge essentially
[03:37:32] <ProfSimm> Yes. It's loops
[03:37:35] <ProfSimm> Looped*
[03:37:44] <ProfSimm> Like Pac-Man :P
[03:38:05] <Irishmanluke> I think it would be cool if something could just walk of the edge and cease to exist

[03:48:57] <inhahe_> or is the field merely "in" space?
[03:49:19] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: fields seem like a convenient way to model something you don't wanna talk about what it is.
[03:49:30] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: "let's just keep adding fields until it works"
[03:49:32] <inhahe_> also, how can you define a field except as a way in which matter is affected depending on its position?
[03:53:22] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: it seems when "things" let's call it entities, particles, quarks, what have you, co-exist for some period of time, they become mostly homogenous, and at equilibrium, at which point they start behaving like a "field", a substrate upon which higher-level interactions start to form.
[03:53:48] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: imagine we were big enough to not be able to discern atoms and molecules, we'd probably be talking about "air field' and "water field"

[04:12:25] <ProfSimm> Which is more fundamental is an enigma
[04:12:45] <Irishmanluke> I had a math professor who firmly believed the universe was funamentally discrete
[04:14:00] <ProfSimm> Irishmanluke: did he explain his belief
[04:14:13] <Delf> ProfSimm: I'm told I'm an enigma but that doesn't make me a fundamentalist, does it?
[04:14:20] <inhahe_> My understanding is that the only reason for quanta (discreteness) is that standing waves can only exist at certain wavelengths
[04:14:30] <Irishmanluke> it kind of makes sense because from mathematical perspective discrete math is clearly more fundamental right? You can construct continuous math out of discrete math, I guess you could go in the other direction too but that makes no sense because you'd be going from greater complexity to lower complexity just thinking out loud
[04:14:36] <inhahe_> so continuity is more fundamental
[04:14:50] <Bakunin> fields are fundamental
[04:15:13] <Bakunin> particles, like photons, are expressions of intensity within their fields
[04:15:23] <Irishmanluke> ProfSimm: I think he was just saying we know his from quantum mechanics which isn't really a good argument

[04:18:48] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: imagine holding a jumprope and swinging it around such that both ends remain still. the only way to do that is with a wave that's the length of the jumprope, or two waves that are half the length of the jumprope each, or three waves that are a third the length each, etc. that's analogous to the standing wave that makes up an electron
[04:18:55] <ProfSimm> Bakunin: or if I'm wrong, go take your Nobel prize I guess
[04:20:19] <ProfSimm> inhahe: all right so you mean resonant frequence and its harmonics (multiples). But what makes the rope length fixed?

[04:27:08] <inhahe_> to my mind, the only reason fields propagate at finite speed in a vacuum is that causality itself has a speed limit (c). could the vacuum permeability and permittivity constants just be derived from c and not based on reality?

[04:29:47] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: many physicists call C the speed of causality (convenient letter, huh), but I don't know if I'm ready to think it's that fundamental yet. "Speed of causality" sounds pretty final.
[04:30:19] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: otherwise permetivity/permeability may be dependent on that speed, or cause it

[04:33:22] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: speed faster than C won't cause paradoxes just yet. What would cause paradoxies is infinite speed
[04:33:53] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: as we know in math and logic, self-referential definitions and infinities tend to cause paradoxes because they're purely hypothetical constructs of the mind

[04:34:21] <ProfSimm> Delf: you did :) ^
[04:35:12] <inhahe_> My understanding is that, according to the theory of relativity, going faster than c would cause paradoxes. I could be wrong, but I'd have to ask a physicist to be sure.
[04:35:30] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I'm not suggesting infinite speed of propagation, but I'm suggesting C might not be fundamental in general, just to waves tied to the vacuum (EM, gravity, and few other fields that make up matter)
[04:36:04] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: well there's nothing special about the particular speed C. If you double it everywhere in the math, things turn out the same
[04:36:19] <mycroftiv> oh]
[04:36:37] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: or divide it respectively
[04:37:14] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: also we already know entanglement is non-local. We can't break causality yet with it, but it's decidedly propagating faster than light.
[04:37:19] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: yes, but given that it happens to be what it is, going faster than it would cause paradoxes. if you doubled it, going faster than double it would cause paradoxes.
[04:37:35] <inhahe_> entanglement isn't propagation because it's not causal.
[04:38:05] <inhahe_> it's just unreasonably high correlation
[04:38:14] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: hmm it can't break causation at the observers, but I'm not sure it's not "causal". I mean the observations made on each end, effectively cause each other
[04:38:44] <inhahe_> if it were causal you'd be able to transmit information with it
[04:38:46] <ProfSimm> Well yes, what is causation is not correlation in time :P
[04:38:51] <ProfSimm> if*
[04:39:46] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: we need to separate two things. Can we pass information with it and break causality is one thing, is it itself causing one observation to depend on the other is another thing.
[04:40:37] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: we can't pass information because observing it breaks the entanglement. But it's there prior

[04:42:54] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: i think the correlation between the observations isn't time-dependent. it doesn't matter which you observe first, does it? idk i forget exactly how entanglement works. so nothing's propagating instantaneously. all entanglement requires is non-local variables. that's not the same as propagation.

[04:43:34] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: it doesn't matter which you observe first, but being time symmetric doesn't mean there's no causality. Many quantum interactions are time symmetric. Not all, but most.
[04:44:26] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: well non-local variables... means variables that propagate in two points in space
[04:44:49] <inhahe_> i don't agree that "non-local" means "instantly propagating"

[04:45:18] <ProfSimm> please*
[04:46:00] <inhahe_> well, propagation is a particular type of action. non-local just means not dependent on location, or not locally bound. it doesn't imply an action.
[04:46:17] <inhahe_> i think the idea that entanglement requires propagation is just the monkey mind trying to cope with it
[04:46:40] <inhahe_> non-local kind of fuses locations, maybe
[04:47:16] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: all right, so it fuses locations.
[04:47:31] <inhahe_> maybe
[04:48:10] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I'm personally more open to the Everett interpretation, which implies no propagation and not fusing of two locations, rather it's all relational and subjective.
[04:48:48] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: but whichever it is, it suggests speed of light as defined in "meters per second" is not a limit in that case right
[04:49:24] <inhahe_> well speed of light applies to causality/propagation
[04:49:45] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: physicists get lost in their models and trying to preserve causality, and they think the universe is "smart" and tricks things into maintaining causality, like our inability to pass information by entanglement. I think that's frankly a somewhat infantile way of trying to explain what happens here.
[04:50:05] <ProfSimm> The universe doesn't have an agenda on how causation works, I bet.
[04:51:11] <ProfSimm> We have to acknowledge that speed limit in meters per second is kinda meaningless with entanglement as we observe it.
[04:51:16] <inhahe_> i don't see it as the universe being smart or tricky, trickiness only comes in in the fact that we find it difficult to wrap our heads around entanglement and how it doesn't imply ftl causation
[04:51:26] <ProfSimm> And speed limit of causality is a bit too abstract to ponder.
[04:51:42] <Bakunin> inhahe_ that's not entanglement though
[04:51:58] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I think it's fairly clear how entanglement doesn't allow us to pass data

[04:59:58] <ProfSimm> Yes, good on him. Why should he
[05:00:16] <ProfSimm> What does "true randomness" mean anyway
[05:00:36] <ProfSimm> Randomness is a human concept, like infinity and objective truth, and reality and so on
[05:00:51] <inhahe_> determinism/mechanicism is also a human concept
[05:00:51] <ProfSimm> Randomness means "oh this obeys no pattern we can detect"
[05:01:09] <ProfSimm> Just because we can't detect it, doesn't mean there's no pattern, or cause to it
[05:01:34] <inhahe_> but is it warranted to assume there is?
[05:01:59] <ProfSimm> The white noise on old CRT TVs also looks random. Do you know what causes it? Actually a good chunk of it is literally the Cosmic Background Radiation
[05:02:18] <ProfSimm> I guess it looked like true randomness before someone figured out what it is
[05:03:22] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I think we need to stay undecided on it until we know more, but adding "true randomness" to the concepts we have is unwarranted until we have evidence or reason to believe it exists.
[05:04:14] <ProfSimm> inhahe: at this small scale we perform quantum experiments, particles and wave vibrate at incredible speed and the particular moment a particle is shot at a detector, it's trajectory depends on the particular phase the wave was at that moment.
[05:04:20] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: i'd say assuming total mechanicism or determinism is unwarranted without a theory that predicts everything
[05:04:25] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: it's for all practical purposes random
[05:04:48] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: we have no means at all to predict it. But it's not some sort of new idea - true randomness. It's just things oscillating really, really fast.
[05:05:46] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: so you want us to only declare what our theories describe deterministic, and everything else is just somehow magically random.
[05:05:55] <inhahe_> i don't know enough qm to know if all 'absolute randomness' can be attributed to wave phase, but i kind of doubt iit
[05:05:59] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I don't this this statistically matches our observations so far

[05:06:15] <Bakunin> what
[05:06:30] <Bakunin> ignore "absolute randomness" and such nonsense
[05:08:04] <inhahe_> the way i see it, the predictability of many things - especially simple systems and macroscopic systems - doesn't imply a theoretical predictability of all things. that's an unwarranted induction.
[05:08:12] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: why
[05:09:15] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I think you may be conflating two things: 1) are things theoretically predictable if you have all info possible on the system 2) is it likely it's practically predictable within the system, us being part of it
[05:09:30] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: the former is I'd say extremely likely, the latter extremely unlikely
[05:09:47] <inhahe_> no, i'm talking about the theoretical predictability
[05:10:10] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: unclear what bothers you about theoretical predictability.
[05:11:04] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: why would the universe stop behaving like it does in all other cases, and become "truly" random precisely at the level where we have no model for yet? We're projecting.
[05:11:46] <inhahe_> macroscopic reality only seems predictable because it's measuring random events in aggregate. assuming the random events are also predictable is projecting

[05:20:02] <inhahe_> most thintgs are not predictable. for example, when your computer is going to crash. what i'm going to say next. when i'm going to die. what an animal is going to do next. when yellowstone is going to erupt.

[05:21:27] <ProfSimm> You're making assumptions based on everyday predictability without full information, and applying those assumptions to what it means to be "deterministic"
[05:21:30] <ProfSimm> Which is a big mistake.
[05:21:42] <ProfSimm> Computers are 100% deterministic by design. To say we don't know what is silly.
[05:21:50] <inhahe_> you're assuming that if we had enough information we could predict those things
[05:22:05] <ProfSimm> Yes. Because it's the fact.

[05:23:24] <inhahe_> that's just your assumption.

[05:25:23] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: all that science is explained by and superseded by quantum mechanics, and quantum mechanics is inherently stochastic

[05:26:30] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: the previous assumptions of determinism in those models was unwarranted. none of those models could predict everything
[05:26:43] <inhahe_> aggregate physics isn't deterministic, only partially so
[05:26:58] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I think what trips you up, and many others, is this internal mental panic that your behavior is predetermined by rules, and you have no "free will".
[05:27:44] <Panther> That's the difference with computers.
[05:30:43] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: in any case we have no data at all to claim QM is "truly" random. This is an axiom in the math model. Because that's how far it goes.

[05:33:15] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: your argument hinges on the assumption that if we had a giant apparatus that could snapshot a city we could predict it
[05:33:25] <Panther> Having totally free will isn't all that useful, since it implies there is no context for it.
[05:33:36] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: that's because we have literally millions of predictions on all aspects of what a city contains.
[05:33:56] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: you don't even accept a computer is deterministic, which I think gives away your bias

[05:34:38] <inhahe_> computers are no more fundamentally deterministic than any other physical system. we just build them to behave according to certain specifications until they fail.
[05:34:52] <ProfSimm> Why yes we do...
[05:34:56] <ProfSimm> That's kinda the point

[05:35:13] <inhahe_> and even when behaving according to those specifications, there's a lot of room for randomness while still adhering to the spec
[05:35:25] <ProfSimm> Well not that much room
[05:35:27] <inhahe_> the predictability is only in certain dimensions of behavior
[05:35:48] <ProfSimm> If there was room for randomness you wouldn't be able to boot your OS before it crashes
[05:35:51] <inhahe_> there's *tons* of microscopic randomness in a computer
[05:36:16] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I prefer to call it imprecision of manufacturing
[05:36:17] <inhahe_> all that matters is that the voltage on a gate is close to + or - 5 or whatever
[05:36:33] <ProfSimm> But at every step this is accounted for
[05:36:36] <Bakunin> "free will" is Not Even Wrong
[05:37:14] <inhahe_> it's not just about imprecision in manufacturing
[05:38:20] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: yes, it's also about imprecision of power supply and environmental conditions
[05:38:20] <Panther> Free will is nice to help people feel like they are not being consistently manipulated into doing things that are not in their best interest, assuming they even know what is.

[05:39:42] <ProfSimm> I think the saddest part about free will in relation to QM randomness, is that it essentially defines free will as the part of you that's unconditionally arbitrary.
[05:39:56] <ProfSimm> That's not "will". That's mental Parkinson's disease.
[05:40:03] <inhahe_> my point is that there's no more reason to think that a computer is deterministic than there is to think anything else in life is deterministic. they just behave according to spec until they fail (unpredictably), and even then, they're only predictable in certain aspects of abstract measurement
[05:40:50] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: in my view, the opposite of determinism doesn't have to be absolute, meaningless/arbitrary randomness. it could be meaningful but non-mechanistic forces

[05:41:18] <zeroc00l0> What's definition for determinism are you using?
[05:41:21] <Panther> Computers don't have volition.
[05:41:41] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: there's a reason to think a computer is more deterministic because we don't care about the state of the entire system, but specific inputs and outputs that the computer was built to process with specific behaviors. I.e. a computer not just a sum of atoms, it's the implementation of an abstract machine
[05:42:24] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: i guess it could be 'more deterministic' in that respect, but it doesn't make them fully deterministic
[05:43:35] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: it doesn't make it fully deterministic only isofar we don't have a perfect snapshot of the system at quantum level to work with and said gigantic quantum computer to run it on
[05:44:05] <inhahe_> well, yes, i know about your assumption that if we had all the data to infinite detail we could theoretically predict anything
[05:44:06] <inhahe_> ;p
[05:44:18] <Panther> It doesn't matter if they work the way they are 'supposed to' or if they fail for a reason that isn't known, they have no ability to enforce a will upon anything, including themselves.
[05:44:30] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: consider this, back when the Big Bang happened, the particular way it happened predetermined that billions of years later, we two would be bickering about determinism all night on IRC

[05:47:31] <Panther> You may as well assume you have free will. You could never know enough about what influences are determining your life, anyway.
[05:47:58] <Panther> Especially if you are considering that it involves the structure and processes of the whole universe.
[05:48:58] <ProfSimm> Free will is contextual anyway. In the context of society, as long as other agents of society are not impacting my will, I have free will. If I'm brainwashed by propaganda and TV ads, I have no free will. Ah shit... I have no free wil..
[05:49:04] <Panther> If you did somehow know it, you would probably be bored to death.
[05:49:45] <Panther> That's why Gods make things like this... angels singing for a few trillion years gets very tiresome.
[05:49:50] <ProfSimm> Free will is like kids that want to be different in high school. They all dress the same like emos.
[05:50:14] <inhahe_> you still have free will if you're brainwashed, your choices are just made within that context
[05:50:37] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: well making choices within brainwashed context is the definition of diminished free will.
[05:50:55] <inhahe_> maybe, but free will doesn't imply absolute freedom

[05:53:53] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: we have many experiments in psychiatry and neurology that show we make decisions and our mind retroactively explains why we "decided" so even if it's not the case

[05:57:06] <ProfSimm> Creativity is a nice name for a series of basic processes of intepreting patterns and recombining them into similar other patterns
[05:57:13] <inhahe_> that may be creativity limited by a particular context, the need to fit in or emulate (there's still degrees of freedom in those songs). also not all musicians copy other bands. and of course not all creativity is music making.

[22:16:14] <ProfSimm> Delf: saw that guy talking about light that you asked if he's full of shit. Yeah he's full of shit
[22:17:11] <ProfSimm> Delf: he has a couple of points but also strawmans a bunch of things "scientists can't answer" (yes they can) and keeps repeating about the aether. Fields are like an aether yes, but that's not that groundbreaking
[22:17:44] <iryith> wasn't aether disproven ages ago?
[22:18:40] <xx> it was
[22:18:51] <xx> but that word might be reused for something new
[22:19:52] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[22:24:59] <Delf> What is aether?
[22:25:12] <ProfSimm> iryith: well it was "disproven" but then reinvented
[22:25:34] <ProfSimm> As QFT
[22:25:43] <iryith> ah, ok
[22:26:03] <ProfSimm> we keep going back and forth
[22:26:11] <ProfSimm> our models are crude yet
[22:26:26] <iryith> well, we are just basically monkeys with hats, so
[22:26:37] <ProfSimm> I don't have a hat :(
[22:26:43] <iryith> just a monkey then :D
[22:26:54] * ProfSimm buys a hat
[22:27:34] <inhahe_> I have a hat (actually over 100 of them), but I'm not currently wearing one, does that count or not
[22:28:03] *** Quits: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@176-12-60-137.pon.spectrumnet.bg) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:28:07] <inhahe_> well at least 50
[22:28:23] <iryith> what do you do with so many hats?
[22:28:27] *** Joins: f1se4 (~f1se4@213.195.113.45)
[22:28:27] <iryith> I have like...2
[22:28:52] <inhahe_> i used to collect baseball caps
[22:29:09] <iryith> for collector value or just for kicks?
[22:29:37] <inhahe_> idk I guess for kicks, or maybe i had some delusion my collection could be worth something, idr
[22:29:48] <iryith> nice! What is your favorite one?
[22:30:04] <inhahe_> i also have 6 or so bucket hats just because i like them, but i only end up wearing one
[22:30:10] <inhahe_> hmmm
[22:30:49] <inhahe_> maybe a greenish one with a cool symbol on it (i don't know what the symbol means)
[22:31:03] <iryith>    so not a sports team then?
[22:31:10] <inhahe_> no, i don't like sports
[22:31:35] <iryith> I don't know anything about hats, but it's cool you're passionate about it
[22:32:06] <iryith> so are they like...superhero logos or bands or?
[22:32:32] <inhahe_> various things. one is a novelty cap, a giant upside down pair of underwear
[22:32:41] <inhahe_> one has fake dreads
[22:32:46] <inhahe_> one has lights on it
[22:32:56] <inhahe_> a lot of them are employees hats for various companies
[22:33:07] <iryith> nice!
[22:33:22] <iryith> I guess each one in your collection has a story about how you got it
[22:33:32] <inhahe_> some of them i got in bulk
[22:33:36] <inhahe_> from yard sales
[22:33:55] <iryith> yeah, still, a bit of history
[22:34:22] <inhahe_> yeah but i don't remember those histories ü§£
[22:34:26] <iryith> haha
[22:34:31] <iryith> so, why hats? what draws you to them?
[22:34:47] <iryith> why not shoes or pens
[22:35:01] <inhahe_> i don't remember why i started collecting hats, but it's not the only thing i've collected
[22:35:26] <iryith> fair enough
