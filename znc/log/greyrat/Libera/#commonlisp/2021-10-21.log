[00:00:42] <James`> So I am writing some tests (fiasco), and doing stuff like (deftest t1-fail () ....
[00:01:23] <James`> Now I want to automate the name generation, so I can write each test like a reader macro #T(...) and have the names automatically created for each
[00:02:01] <James`> So I just write the basic test, and I extract from it which function I'm testing and a counter for that function (stored in a hash table) to then build the deftest form

[00:07:43] <Bike> can you just do like, (defmacro my-deftest (&body body) `(deftest ,(generate-a-name) ,@body)), or what am i missing here
[00:11:38] <Nilby> Lisp seems like a drug that causes the human mind to create test frameworks.
[00:15:59] <James`> That's what I initially tried, but couldn't get it to work
[00:16:23] <Bike> what happened?
[00:19:34] <James`> It doesn't seem to create the test macro (e.g. I do my-test-1231 and I get an error 'No test ....)
[00:19:54] <James`> Whereas if I manually do it, it works. I think it may have something to do with interning symbols...
[00:20:14] <James`> But not sure to be honest
[00:20:39] <James`> (defun generate-a-name () (incf *counter*) (make-symbol (concatenate 'string "my-test-123" (write-to-string *counter*))))
[00:21:45] <Bike> wait, okay, so then you need the name later?
[00:21:58] <Bike> i'm not sure i understand your goal here. You want nameless tests except you actually do need to know the name?
[00:22:31] <James`> Yeah I'm going to write all the tests in a file, so I need the names

[00:23:31] <Bike> okay, well how about you store the names somewhere. do (defvar *test-names* nil) and then (defmacro my-deftest (&body body) (let ((name (generate-a-name))) `(progn (push ',name *test-names*) (deftest ,name ,@body)))
[00:27:54] <James`> Thanks, I will play around with it, don't want to take up more of your time. I faced the same issue, 'no test ....' after running it, but I gotta figure this out for myself, sounds like its possible to do it the way you say and what I thought initially so its something else
[00:28:04] <James`> That's causing the issue

[09:24:22] <lukego> Hey I'm trying to fix a build failure in UAX-15. The immediate symptom is that helper function CHAR-FROM-HEXSTRING is being called at compile-time but not defined with EVAL-WHEN. That's easy to fix. But I'm looking at the code that calls it, wondering if this needs some EVAL-WHEN too in order to have its intended effect. Anyone care to opine on https://github.com/sabracrolleton/uax-15/blob/master/src/precomputed-tables.lisp#L68-L109 ?
[09:27:36] <lukego> actually now I'm reading https://fare.livejournal.com/146698.html and it's telling me that LOOP forms at the top-level will execute at load-time by default and then maybe I'm misreading the whole situation. The code looks like it's supposed to run at load-time and I guess the previous DEFUN should be available there. *thinks*
[09:27:38] <etimmons> lukego: I don't think CHAR-FROM-HEXSTRING needs an EVAL-WHEN. It seems the actual problem is in the .asd.
[09:28:00] <etimmons> precomputed-tables should :depend-on trivial-utf-16
[09:28:12] <etimmons> s/depend/depends/
[09:30:06] <lukego> ah, thanks!
[09:31:07] <lukego> Seems like we need a tree shaker type of thing that takes an ASDF system and compiles it with randomized linearizations of the dependency graph, each time in a fresh image, to look for failing cases
[09:32:02] <etimmons> Yeah, such a tool would be awesome. I think fare was going around for a while adding missing dependencies that he found using POIU

[09:33:22] <etimmons> Although I am interested in how you ran into that... I would have expected LOAD-SYSTEM on a stock ASDF to have loaded trivial-utf-16 before operating on precomputed-tables
[09:34:01] <lukego> Yeah, I'm curious too. Just happened while upgrading the Nix repo to the latest Quicklisp. But maybe we should take that to #clpm or something.

[12:15:35] <lisp123> How difficult was it before the ASDF days to build and deploy systems?
[12:17:34] <jackdaniel> there were defsystem libraries before asdf
[12:18:22] <jackdaniel> mk-defsystem was a portable one put together by Mark Kantrowitz
[12:18:35] <jackdaniel> and there were implementation-specific build systems too
[12:19:09] <lisp123> MK is a legend (I'm downloading all of the CMU Repo Archives now which he meticulously maintained). Was there a reason ASDF became de facto?

[12:26:04] <jackdaniel> I don't know the exact interface, but afair you were supposed to pass the url of the dependency and it installed it (and these dependencies could reference other urls etc), so it was decentralized - but there was no quality control (or curations) so things easily broke :)

[12:55:01] <lisp123> That's 8 solid years :)
[12:55:43] <beach> Isn't there a book with the title "Learn Common Lisp in 10 years" or something like that?
[12:58:23] <beach> Maybe made that up.
[12:58:27] <lisp123> I tried searching, but didn't find it. Would be curious to read it for sure. There is a really good set of online notes for teaching Lisp to kids, but I can't seem to find it
[13:00:58] <jackdaniel> beach: perhaps you've meant this Norvig essay? https://arantius.com/misc/mirror/TeachYourselfProgramming.html
[13:01:03] <beach> Well, either way, the book "Peak, secretes from the new science of expertise" claims that pretty much every expert in any domain has spent 10 years or so of hard work to get there.  The converse is not true of course.  In software development, we have people who worked for much longer than that without becoming experts.
[13:01:24] <beach> jackdaniel: That's it!  Thanks!
[13:01:59] <jackdaniel> OK, 2 years more and only after that I will be entitled to feel disappointed that I've wasted that time and didn't become an expert :)

[13:28:47] <beach> Got it.
[13:29:11] <pjb> Perhaps it was Stanford LISP 1.6, since it worked on pdp-10.
[13:29:55] *** Joins: mrcom (~mrcom@99-73-215-70.lightspeed.irvnca.sbcglobal.net)
[13:31:38] <pjb> Ah, no, MacLISP was before Stanford LISP 1.6: "When Stanford received a PDP-6 [the original MacLISP developed at M.I.T.] was converted to run under the DEC monitor; several modifications and embellishments were performed and this LISP became LISP 1.6, also known as Stanford LISP."
[13:33:45] <pjb> By the way, it seems to me that the REPL was an important factor in the development of the condition system. In LISP 1.5, and other early lisps, there was just a global error handler hook, which was certainly sufficient for batch programs…
[13:36:04] <beach> I guess the Multics command processor was like a REPL.  I am saying that because Multics PL/I is the origin of the Common Lisp condition system.

[13:45:42] <pl> wass the command processor a privileged component or did it run normally inside user context?
[13:47:10] <beach> I think it was an ordinary application.
[13:48:14] <pl> because iirc, multics esssentially logged you into a single process, and everything you ran operated within that image
[13:48:40] <pl> (if you were privileged enough, you could get more than one simultaneous image)
[13:48:40] <beach> Correct.  No new process was created when a command was invoked.
[13:49:24] <pl> then I'd say it was definitely a repl, since every command essentially invoked a function visible in the image
[13:49:34] <beach> So in that respect too it was like a Common Lisp REPL.  If a condition was signaled, one could examine the stack, run the debugger, etc.
[13:49:43] <beach> Right.

[14:28:24] <madnificent> jackdaniel: there were multiple approaches before QuickLisp but I do recall the community gravitating to QuickLisp very very rapidly.  Finding compatible libraries could be a challenge, especially for novices like myself.  Some of the speed of adoption came from Xach's well-deserved reputation.  Starting with QuickLisp was also much easier than the alternatives, at least for my clouded view at the time.
[14:32:37] <jackdaniel> madnificent: there is no doubt that quicklisp is more convenient - libraries are tested between releases whether they work and that is a huge difference

[20:20:15] <mzan> But I don't know how much Inferno is used. Probably less than CL.
[20:20:50] <mzan> Very few idea of Plan9, in particular the programming language, are now in the Go PL.

[20:32:02] <nature> shka: Depends what you call relevant. 9front is maintained by a pretty active community and honestly works pretty well for most tasks.
[20:32:41] <pl> there are few commercial products running plan9 too
[20:32:48] <pl> but no, it's not a major OS
[20:32:48] <nature> If relevant = chrome/firefox bootloader, then Plan 9 is irrelevant indeed.
[20:32:52] <pl> but then, so is Mezzano
[20:33:11] <pl> nature: Plan9 was capable of running Firefox for a time if you prepared the binary in certain way
[20:34:14] <nature> Yeah I know, they managed to build Xorg for it at some point
[20:35:29] <nature> I've been using/learning on it for about 2 months on and off, I really like it, it is as eye opening regarding OSes as CL was for me regarding programming!
