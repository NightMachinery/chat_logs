[01:46:31] <fsmunoz> TRS-80: indeed I have, that was my next idea.
[01:47:18] <fsmunoz> TRS-80: so I think I'm good; since I'm new to tab-bar-mode I was just asking in case there was this magical setting that made things automatically go to a tab. I remember elscreen had something like that.
[01:47:39] <fsmunoz> But Idon't think that's the case here, so I'll work around hooks/advices.
[01:48:12] <TRS-80> check in tab-bar-mode, as well as the irc package itself...
[01:49:04] <TRS-80> if you are using something like dunst, there is likely a way to send the window / tab id along with the notification, and then call back to it somehow

[09:30:06] <corwin> afidegnum: i tend to suspect you will need to write the outermost loop yourself, and "manually" call yasnippet from that.  This would be the function that needs to receive user input (e.g. maybe `completing-read') and then allow us to navigate to/though a set of snippets, select one to start, and then the prompts in yasnippet from there.  For nesting, I'd expect to "count" recursion manually, meaning you need to know which ones are
[09:30:06] <corwin> "containers".
[09:30:53] <corwin> codingquark: got me, mate.  I ended up getting a powered skateboard :P
[09:32:20] <codingquark> My fuel savings will easily cover the bike's cost in a few months. But that still doesn't tell me how much I *should* be spending. There are models from ~US$350 to US$2000

[09:32:42] <codingquark> If I can evaluate if I need gears, that itself will reduce the number of options
[09:33:20] <corwin> that's a good call. just talking to our 13yo about that in the context of VR they are saving up for.
[09:33:34] <corwin> "What about games?   Are you going to want the nicer controllers?"
[09:34:29] <codingquark> And then there's the ultimate question, what if I don't use the pedelec either :-D
[09:34:59] <codingquark> That will be ridiculous. It's like signing up for gym and in 10 days coming up with excuses to not go go exercise
[09:35:39] <corwin> I mean, but it does happen though.  It's worth considering, at any rate.  It's the point I would consider resale value, tbh.

[09:42:18] <twb> 2nd-hand probably needs new battery anyway
[09:42:39] <codingquark> twb: just couldn't find it for sale
[09:42:55] <twb> battery packs like that will be expensive

[09:43:34] <codingquark> Cool
[09:44:26] <codingquark> 2nd hand bikes are super cheap I gotta say. 10kINR will get me pretty high quality bike
[09:46:25] <twb> That's like... 1000 USD?  or  100 USD?
[09:46:52] <codingquark> Around 100
[09:47:17] <twb> Yeah that's about what I'd expect

[09:48:05] <codingquark> Oh cool! So the cost is normal. Do you think I should get such a bike and try it out? $WORK is 12km one way
[09:48:17] <twb> so like 10000 INR is 10000 cents
[09:48:29] <codingquark> That's a good enough way
[09:48:44] <corwin> seems like a solid plan to me.  make careful plans around where you will leave and how you will secure it.
[09:48:56] <twb> "build one to throw away"
[09:49:15] <twb> So get a "not expected to be good" cheap bike first, try it for 2 to 8 weeks
[09:49:45] <twb> That gives you a feel for all the things you wouldn't otherwise think to look for
[09:49:59] <codingquark> Secure it by taking it inside the office and putting it in one of the rooms
[09:50:00] <corwin> that that makes a great deal of sense imo

[14:13:52] <aidalgol> loskutak: I'm surprised that ever worked.

[14:15:37] <aidalgol> As far as I know, you've always had to go out of your way to make GUI Emacs distinguish between C-i and TAB, because of the way it handles key input.

[14:18:12] <loskutak> hmm, pressing tab on org-mode heading always toggled them (org-cycle) and I don't remember C-i not working (evil-jump-forward), but maybe it didn't in org files. Now pressing tab on org-mode heading results in evil-jump-forward
[14:18:22] <rnkn> oh yeah if you use <tab> in a keymap I think it only picks up in GUI

[14:21:32] <loskutak> I am aware of that C-i / tab equivalence in console. I am only interested in GUI. But seems like adding <tab> -> org-cycle into org-mode-map solved the issue. Maybe org-mode recently switched from <tab>, to TAB in the default org-mode-map? Will check.

[15:44:27] <stevoooo> i re-read it every now and again and still pick up things
[15:44:44] <stevoooo> i suppose it depends on your level of emacs expertise and interest really 
[15:45:15] <codingquark> arjun: buy, it is excellent
[15:45:34] <arjun> codingquark: yea?
[15:45:43] <stevoooo> if you've "mastered" emacs already then it's probably not going to help, but given the general lack of emacs books out there, what have you really got to lose?
[15:45:44] <codingquark> Yeah

[15:46:20] <stevoooo> for a lifetime of emacs fun?
[15:46:36] <stevoooo> you can even read it in emacs!
[15:47:08] <arjun> i am like, hey, emacs is  a free editor, been around for a while, there should be good free books around right?

[15:48:39] <stevoooo> it works very differently to the o'reilly book - it really just teaches you how to explore emacs yourself
[15:49:32] <susam> arjun: I bought the book sometime back before the 20% discount was announced. I do a book club meeting on this book via Twitch with permission from the author.
[15:49:40] <rnkn> arjun: the info books are books
[15:49:43] <codingquark> arjun: hmm? Emacs has excellent docs, info system, blogs, people mostly write good readme for their packages...
[15:50:42] <bremner> arjun: I'm curious, what software has good free books? I can only think of the git book offhand.
[15:50:43] <susam> Having said that, I have learnt most of my Emacs by reading C-h o and the info pages. Never really read an Emacs book. Yet I decided to read the Mastering Emacs book because it is a joy to read. Beautiful typography and it is a fun read.
[15:50:56] <arjun> susam: how's that going?
[15:51:15] <bremner> is that Butterick's book?
[15:51:25] <susam> arjun: Going okay. Completed chapter 2 last weekend. Chapter 2 is all about terminology that most Emacs users must be already familiar with.
[15:51:48] <susam> Frame, window, buffer, point, mode, etc.

[15:55:27] <susam> "Practical Common Lisp" is a free book that comes to mind. Pretty good book and freely available, although can be purchased if one wishes to.
[15:55:43] <arjun> rnkn: WHAT IS THAT
[15:55:55] *** Quits: cchristiansen (~user@n122-106-221-66.sbr1.nsw.optusnet.com.au) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:56:18] <rnkn> arjun: it's the Emacs manual, once of the many free books that comes with Emacs
[15:56:26] <bremner> susam: yes, that's another example. I still think it's pretty far from being the norm
[15:56:48] <arjun> susam: myself really.
[15:57:02] <MysteriousSilver> how many of you guys usually read manuals for software? (excluding emacs, obviously)
[15:57:06] <arjun> not really a beginner but i don't yet write elisp
[15:57:07] <rnkn> as for being a newbie, your starup screen gives you a step-by-step tutorial, a link to the FAQ, and a link to the manual
[15:57:41] <arjun> but if you guys say the book dope, i'd take your words for it : )
[15:57:45] <susam> I agree. Definitely not the norm. I can hazard a guess why it is so. Writing books is a lot of hard work. One might argue why so much software is free then when writing software is also hard work. I think that is because a lot of successful software start as hobby. Software just happens out of passion, even impulsively. Books do require a lot of discipline and hard work to complete.
[15:58:44] <susam> arjun: Mastering Emacs does not teach elisp. I think, for elisp, the GNU elisp manual is all one needs. Mastering Emacs is a gentle guide from going from Emacs newbie to Emacs power user.
[15:59:01] <arjun> also, software is a moving target. you can't just write a book and leave it.
[15:59:16] <arjun> it'll need to be updated / revised to stay relevant
[16:00:07] <arjun> susam: i understand that. that's what i've been considering it for
[16:00:29] <arjun> the sale is till next monday right, iirc ?
[16:00:53] <arjun> also, mickey if you're here, thanks for sale : P (and writing the book in the first place)
[16:01:42] <susam> arjun: I recommend the book. I have been using Emacs for many years and recently switched to being a full time Emacs user. I still pick some new tips and tricks every time I surf through the book. Despite Emacs's info pages, online documentation, etc. I think, it is a nice book to have in your collection.
[16:01:55] <arjun> i see.
[16:02:16] <arjun> i actually can't stand using VScode anymore
[16:02:18] <arjun> laggy AF
[16:02:27] <arjun> sublime is what comes close for me
[16:02:42] <arjun> and then there's this entire beast called emacs
[16:03:04] <arjun> but i've already been spoiled by emacs and its keybindings
[16:04:17] <susam> arjun: If you are looking for a book club sort of thing check out the Twitch channel spcafe. Book clubs keep me motivated to chug along through the entire book. Scheduling discussion occurs at #sp on this network. People there are from this #emacs channel in fact as the Mastering Emacs book club was formed here.
[16:05:05] <arjun> yo, i'd be sure to drop by susam:
[16:05:21] <MysteriousSilver> judybot: on the system I administrate, vi is symlinked to ed. Emacs has been replaced by
[16:05:24] <judybot> MysteriousSilver: vi, the same way you can replace emacs with the shell or the shell's substitute. I think the key here is that when.

[19:02:36] <edgar-rft> hendursaga, I think this is what you want to know: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.26 - Emacs can now be built with support for Little CMS. If the lcms2 library is installed, Emacs will enable features built on top of that library.  The new configure option '--without-lcms2' can be used to build without lcms2 support even if it is installed.  Emacs linked to Little CMS exposes color 
[19:02:37] <edgar-rft> management functions in Lisp: the color metrics 'lcms-cie-de2000' and 'lcms-cam02-ucs', as well as functions for conversion to and from CIE CAM02 and CAM02-UCS.
[19:03:44] <edgar-rft> To me it sounds like just another attempt to overengineer Emacs with unneccessary features...
[19:03:59] <wasamasa> and it's detected as a possible windows feature

[20:21:45] <cvandusen> Don't say that until you've seen display-buffer-alist. 
[20:22:18] <bpalmer> the other approach is to just write a command of your own that runs slime and then starts manipulating windows

[20:31:45] <lisp123> like a global solution, without having to figure out how to make it work only for certain commands? looks too complicated atm :(
[20:33:15] <bla> Mhm. "In the current buffer" might be impossible - as the things being opened are usually other buffers. The current window - maybe more. Sorry for picking words but it might help actually to search for help
[20:33:26] <bla> And I'm unsure if something global like that exists. ;s
[20:33:42] <lisp123> bla: thanks, you are right, I always use the terms the wrong way
[20:34:22] <bla> In practice that's not really a problem for me though, if something specific, something I use often bugs me I can force it to behave

[22:29:10] <rwp> bob_x1, It's very normal for editors of all types to put temporary files related to editing files such as buffer save files and lock files in the same directory as the file that is being edited.  Is there a particular reason you are trying to avoid it?
