[13:41:50] <FromGitter> <jtweigle> Hello! I'm trying to figure out how to disable auto-closing of parentheses, brackets, quotes, etc., in python-mode (I have installed the python layer). But I don't even know how to find out what to customize. What function is completing my parentheses for me, and how do I beat it to death?
[13:51:58] <FromGitter> <jtweigle> Ah, figured it out: it was something called `smartparens`, and the variable I had to customize was called `Sp Autoinsert Pair`

[15:23:00] <FromGitter> <rossvor> awesome thanks! That did the job
[15:26:41] <FromGitter> <empwilli_gitlab> I currently use https://github.com/Somelauw/evil-org-mode/issues/93#issuecomment-952995561 to work around this issue, I've added these lines into dotspacemacs/user-init
[15:27:22] <FromGitter> <empwilli_gitlab> (together with "(warn "Workaround for evil-redirect-digit-argument still in place, recheck if still needed")" to notify me on every startup that this workaround still sits there :))
[15:36:35] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> For a single file there is `emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load` or on a newer Emacs `emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load`. There is also `byte-compile-file` (or directory) and `native-compile`. Additionally there is `load-library`. There are many more options, just use `SPC h d f` and 'cleverly' fuzzy search what you are looking for. I forgot how to achieve preview with Helm, but with Ivy I can use `C-M-n/p` to 
[15:36:35] <FromGitter> ... see preview of the info (docstrings).
[16:01:11] <FromGitter> <rossvor> Got it, yeah `emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load` would probably have been quicker, will add it to my notes. Thanks. I've used `SPC f e l` `helm-locate-library` to get to evil-org file which needed editing.
