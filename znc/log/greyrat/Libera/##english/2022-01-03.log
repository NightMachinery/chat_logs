[20:55:18] <bullgard4> w! badger
[20:58:07] <blkshp> A large muscular mammal
[20:58:35] <jemius> A loyal servant of the God-Emperor of Man
[20:58:55] <huf> large?
[20:59:32] <bullgard4> blkshp, There is a Firefox add-on called "Privacy Badger". What has this name to do with a mammal?
[20:59:58] <huf> probably something to do with badgering?
[21:00:07] <huf> what does it do?
[21:00:28] <huf> (it could just be a mascot)
[21:00:57] <blkshp> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:00:58] <huf> what do frosted flakes have to do with a tiger?
[21:01:03] <LjL> interesting example for the second verb sense of badger they have https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/badger#Verb
[21:01:06] <blkshp> We call them frosties!

[21:02:01] <blkshp> It's just a name I think
[21:02:08] <bullgard4> I see.
[21:02:10] <huf> doesnt seem like it's badgering anyone
[21:02:42] <blkshp> Maybe the creator just likes badgers. I mean they care cute until they get hit by and take out the front half of your car.
[21:03:02] <huf> european badgers > all other badgers
[21:03:20] <pussipupu> They don't want cuddles though
[21:03:21] <twb> their poo isn't even rectangular
[21:03:33] <huf> no, not known for their friendliness
[21:03:42] <blkshp> pussipupu: no, don't try to cuddle.

[21:04:18] <pussipupu> Well, I assume they grow back
[21:04:39] <blkshp> xD
[21:12:06] <bullgard4> pussipupu, "to\ grow\ back" means "to diminish in population"?
[21:12:50] <pussipupu> No, it means to grow new ones in place of the old
[21:13:02] <pussipupu> Also why are you escaping spaces? :þ
[21:13:52] <bullgard4> pussipupu, because I looked up first the "dict" dictionary on my computer.

[22:05:30] <TimMc> They may have chosen badgers because they're tough animals who won't put up with any nonsense.
[22:06:41] <TimMc> But yeah, they probably just wanted a cute mascot of some sort.

[23:19:31] <pussipupu> there isn't such a part

[23:21:51] <GuiToris> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom
[23:33:43] <LjL> Wikipedia has a few "failed verification" tags on this, but i see "An estimated 900,000 people speak Welsh in the UK,[17] an official language in Wales[18] and the only de jure official language in any part of the UK.[19]"
[23:33:53] <LjL> in the lead section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_Kingdom
