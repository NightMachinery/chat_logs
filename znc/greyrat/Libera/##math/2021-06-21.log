[00:01:26] <gas51627> Hi, is the analysis ofnthe statement correct: "anyone who bought rolls royce with cash must have a roch uncle"   Ax(B(x, R, C) -> Ey(U(y, x) ^ R(y))  where B(x, y, z) is x bought y for z. R - rolls royce, C - cash, U(y, x) - y is uncle of x, R(y) - y is rich.   Does formula B(x, y, z) fot here ?
[00:02:25] <gas51627> Sorry "fit" not "fot"
[00:03:41] <mh_le> what is a roch uncle?
[00:03:51] <gas51627> rich uncle
[00:03:54] <gas51627> Sorry

[01:27:15] <Fohsap> {2/4,2/16,2/64,2/256,2/1024,...} .  Why is a_n=2/(a_n*4) not okay?
[01:28:23] <Fohsap> and a_n=2/[a_(n-1)*4] is also unacceptable.  It says 2/4^a_n is correct. :/ But in geometric sequences they said we're multiplying and dividing not using exponents.
[01:29:17] <int-e> Fohsap: do you want a closed formula, a recurrence, or both?
[01:29:31] <int-e> in any case, none of these formulas so far are correct
[01:29:44] <Fohsap> I'm given these formuli: r=[a_n]/[a_(n-1)]; a_n=a_1*r^(n-1); a_n=a_(n-1)*4 ....
[01:29:51] <int-e> though maybe one of them just has a typo introduced during copying.
[01:30:21] <Fohsap> So a_1*r^(n-1) = a_(n-1)*r (not 4, that was a typo)....
[01:30:28] <Fohsap> because a_n = a_n.
[01:30:33] <int-e> so if you try to compute r, what do you get?
[01:30:44] <Fohsap> so why wouldn't they accept 2/[a_(n-1)*4]???
[01:30:44] <int-e> you can use r=[a_n]/[a_(n-1)] for that
[01:31:01] <int-e> Fohsap: because it's not correct, not even for n=1.
[01:31:06] <int-e> or n=2 rather
[01:31:10] <Fohsap> that can't be true.
[01:31:29] <int-e> 2/(2/4*4) = 1
[01:31:31] <Fohsap> 2/a_1= 2/4....  2/4*4 = 2/16...
[01:32:04] <Fohsap> [04:58:21] <Fohsap> and a_n=2/[a_(n-1)*4]  and a_1 = 4.   2/[4*4] = 2/16.
[01:33:12] <Fohsap> Must just be some issue with the form.  Dude, I think somiaj is the guy who wanted to know what we were using with canvas to create all of the problems.  I got off Freenode and lost my notes.
[01:33:52] <int-e> Fohsap: But a_1 isn't 4, it's 2/4?
[01:34:50] <Fohsap> so I should just use n?
[01:35:17] <Fohsap> 4/4^n?
[01:35:38] <Fohsap> I mean... well, 2/4^n
[01:36:04] <Fohsap> I also thought it was a_n=2/[a_n*4] at first, but I abandoned that because it said it was wrong.
[01:36:45] <int-e> yes, a_n = 2/4^n. You should also be able to compute r = 1/4, or get the recurrence a_n = a_(n-1) / 4.
[01:36:45] <Fohsap> I see why that's wrong now.  Because a_n = 2/16 and a_[n-1] = 2/4 not 16 and 4 respectively.
[01:36:52] <Fohsap> Thank you, int-e.  That makes a ot of sense now.
[01:37:10] <Fohsap> I'm doing dental surgery today. :/  Been in so much pain.  Finally realized why my working memory is so poor.  Been dealing with this for months.
[01:37:30] <Fohsap> Hard to focus when you're in pain. :P  Can't wait to get this fixed.

[04:54:50] <loopspace> It's the last sentence here. Really, computing Ext just boils down to computing the cohomology of the given resolution, but he skips some steps.

[04:56:13] <loopspace> So I want the cohomology of Hom(P,A)->Hom(P+P,A)->Hom(P,A) with appropriate coboundary operators
[04:59:44] <Fangs> right this should be doable

[10:18:29] <stux|away> patchyy: i found an iso week module online, worst case you can just copy the code that you need from there : https://pypi.org/project/isoweek/
[10:19:15] <Flannel> I'm not sure you need line 7&8, which means I'm not sure you need line 4 to begin with
[10:19:50] <Flannel> But this all stems from me doing it the way I'd normally do it in my head, versus the way you're doing it.

[10:21:23] <Flannel> Arcorann: Looks like Week 1 begins on "the first Monday within the current year".  So if the year started on a Tuesday, there'd be six week 0 days, then a week 1 Monday.

[10:27:10] <quarterback> Can first order ODE's be applied for wind flow estimation?

[10:27:52] <int-e> (compare 2026 to 2027)
[10:28:03] <Flannel> I agree, first Thursday is week 1.  2015 vs 2016
[10:28:05] <int-e> err, 2025 to 20267
[10:28:20] <patchyy> It seems that if 1.jan is on a friday or later in week, its week 0. If its thursday or earlier in week, its week 1
[10:28:45] <Flannel> and by week 0, you really mean week 53 of the previous year, it seems.

[10:54:16] <buster> em: for Klein, geometries are defined in terms of G-spaces, aka group actions. an n-dimensional affine geometry over a field F is a G-space (X, G) equivalent to (F^n, AGL_n(F)).
[10:56:38] <buster> the simplest way to construct such a thing is to let X=F^n, but that comes with an origin and basis that you didn't order. there's another construction via projective geometry, which has no origin, and it can be done starting from an n+1-dimensional abstract vector space over F without ever choosing a basis.
[10:57:57] <buster> that projective construction is where the n+1-dimensional affine coordinate comes from. it's inherited from a homogeneous coordinate for the projective geometry.
[11:00:11] <patchyy> int-e: it runs, at least :) i will do some random date tests
[11:00:18] <patchyy> int-e: thanks a lot!
[11:00:53] <int-e> patchyy: that's a minor miracle already because I didn't test a thing :P

[11:01:41] <int-e> ah
[11:01:42] <patchyy> but other than that, it actually gave correct value for this week

[12:51:14] <int-e> lpapp: you need to alternate between two circles to get the rectangular "faces" of the approximated torus.
[12:51:47] <int-e> lpapp: the 0.5 seems arbitrary though
[12:52:22] <lpapp> int-e: if I remove the 0.5f, it does not change the display
[12:52:49] <int-e> lpapp: do you seen the individual faces in the output?
[12:53:12] <int-e> lpapp: if yes, put the two versions side by side and you should see a small shift. if no, then you won't see a difference.
[12:54:17] <lpapp> int-e: k is for alternating between two main (not tube) circles so that I get rectangles between them?
[12:54:25] <lpapp> (or quad strips in opengl terms)

[13:02:39] <int-e> lpapp: so if you use torus(4, 12); instead and put the two things side by side, you'll notice that the version without the + 0.5 is a bit thicker. That's about all you'll be able to see without shading.
