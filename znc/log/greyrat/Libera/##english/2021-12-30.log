[02:21:54] <mdogg> GuiToris: It can mean a couple of things.  But if I tell somebody that they can "..see right through me..", it means that they know how I feel or what I mean, even though I might say or do something to the contrary.  For example, when a friend of mine took his own life and people asked how I was dealing with it, I always said that I was sad but that I was "ok".  But one of my best friends could see right through me and he knew how much the event really hurt 
[02:21:54] <mdogg> me. 
[02:22:34] <GuiToris> oh, great, I hoped it meant that :)
[02:22:37] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: "X sees right through Y" is usually a statement about Y being transparent (optically or figuratively); "X looks through Y" is a statement about what X is doing
[02:22:58] <mdogg> Well, the term "transparent" is different..  It can mean that, too.
[02:23:34] <GuiToris> there is one or two things that I couldn't find
[02:23:45] <mdogg> Though if I think someone is being transparent I tell them so.  I wouldn't use the term "see right through me" for someone who is transparent. 
[02:23:51] <kurahaupo> "see through something" generally means thwarting deception
[02:24:12] <GuiToris> what is the autonomy of 'nickname'
[02:24:44] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: etymology?
[02:25:18] <mdogg> Yeah, I'm not sure what you mean by autonomy in that case.

[02:25:57] <kurahaupo> .ety nickname
[02:26:04] <mdogg> https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/nickname
[02:26:14] <GuiToris> I meant the opposite
[02:26:19] <GuiToris> I may have used the wrong word
[02:26:30] <GuiToris> I don't have a dictionary now, just the net, which I can't use apparently
[02:26:33] <mdogg> The opposite of a nickname?  
[02:26:47] <GuiToris> Rob is probably the nickname if Robert
[02:26:51] <GuiToris> what is Robert?
[02:26:54] <GuiToris> it's not a nickname
[02:27:01] <GuiToris> it cannot be a full name either
[02:27:02] <mdogg> Well, that's different.
[02:27:23] <GuiToris> how can I refer to someone's not nickname
[02:28:13] <mdogg> I used to have a manager named Peter.  Everybody called him Pete, but one day him and I were hanging out (drinking, actually) and he told me that he didn't like it when people called him "Pete".  He would prefer to be called "Peter".  So from then on I called him Peter - and actually...
[02:28:18] <kurahaupo> you could just ask for their full legal name and use parts of that, but that could be considered impolite
[02:28:30] <mdogg> I ask people what they prefer to be called.  Rob, Robert, Bobby, Bob...
[02:29:09] <kurahaupo> mdogg: "Mr President"
[02:29:15] <mdogg> Most people prefer to be called something even though some of the people they know might call them something else.
[02:29:17] <GuiToris> kurahaupo, for instance, 'what is your full firstname?'
[02:29:25] <GuiToris> I don't really want to know their family name
[02:30:49] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: The appropriate question to ask depends on why you're asking and what you intend to do with the answer
[02:31:08] <mdogg> The letter 'm' is the first letter of my real first name.  When I was 13 years old, one of my friends started calling me mdogg because he created rapper names for all his friends.  His nickname was zman (how he got that, I don't know since his first name started with "w"), my friend Brian became bROCK, and I became mdogg...
[02:32:55] <GuiToris> I see, you don't have a special word for it
[02:33:06] <GuiToris> and probably lastly, there's a sentence that I cannot finish
[02:33:32] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: if you want to know X so that you can say "Hello X", then "what would you like me to call you".
[02:33:51] <mdogg> Well, when applying for a loan, the application would ask for the legal first, middle, and last name (surname)

[02:34:16] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: If you actually want their legal name minus their surname then ask "what are your legal given names"
[02:34:36] <GuiToris> oh
[02:34:43] <GuiToris> however, it sounds a little bit formal
[02:34:47] <GuiToris> but I'm fine with that :)
[02:34:54] <kurahaupo> (not all cultures make a point of separating "first name" and "middle name"; that's predominately a US thing)
[02:35:41] <mdogg> kurahaupo: That's a good point.  For example, a new lady just bought the house across the street from me and my next door neighbor called her "Fergie".  He name is "Fernanda".  When I introduced myself to her she introduced herself as "Fernanda" and I told her, "Elaine calls you Fergie, would you prefer to be called Fernanda?" and she replied, "Yes, I prefer Fernanda." so that's what I call her.

[02:38:45] <kurahaupo> does the SSA split names into 3 parts, or is it just everyone else who does that?
[02:38:59] <GuiToris> I don't know how you say that you don't want them to feel they are the greatest person in the world
[02:39:15] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: s/way to/way too/
[02:39:15] <chat> kurahaupo thinks GuiToris meant to say: and the sentence that I cannot finish... how do you express when you don't want someone to take something way too seriously and act strangely. My sentence is like that : I don't want to overemphasize how great you are so you ....
[02:39:18] <mdogg> GuiToris: Tell them they suck.  =P

[02:40:09] *** Joins: szdani10 (~szdani10@unixit.org)
[02:40:25] <kurahaupo> "You're imitating a vacuum cleaner"?
[02:40:25] <mdogg> kurahaupo: I have a first, middle, and last name.  So SSA has all 3 for me.  But some people only have a first and last name, so SSA will only have 2 names for them.  Some people get married and have a first, middle, last, and a hyphenated 5th name sometimes.  So SSA will have everythign for them.
[02:42:11] <mdogg> It just depends on how the person records their name.  There are certain events that qualify for name changes (like marriage) and other events that can be triggered manually, for example if someone wants to initiate a change of name.  Either way, though, the SSA has a record of all previously used names that are associated with the number that was issued to the individual initially.
[02:42:12] <kurahaupo> mdogg: I mean, does the SSA have a database with 3 fields or 2? Are one's parents obliged to decide which fields to put each of one's given names into?
[02:43:56] <kurahaupo> In the US, if a govt form asks for "first name, middle name & surname", are you breaking the law by putting all your given names into 'first name' and leaving 'middle name' empty?
[02:44:00] <mdogg> kurahaupo: I haven't worked for SSA so I don't know how many fields they have for names, but it must be quite a few.  I have had access to the SSA database before (as a result of my work) and I have seen names as short as two words and as long as 7 or so.  I have never pulled up someone named "Prince" or "Cher" though.  Perhaps it could be as short as 1 field.
[02:44:07] <GuiToris> ok, I found this 'success has gone to his head'
[02:44:14] <GuiToris> have you heard this expression before?
[02:44:45] <kurahaupo> mdogg: I mean, one field could have many names in it, separated by spaces
[02:45:11] <GuiToris> if so how can I connect it to the previous clause? "I don't want to overemphasize how great you are"

[02:45:30] <mdogg> kurahaupo: No you aren't.  Though most people do have a first name and last name, many people do not have a middle name.  So that field is often left blank in those cases.
[02:46:03] <kurahaupo> mdogg: I'm not talking about how many names; I'm talking about whether categorising them as "first" and "middle" actually has any legal justification

[02:47:59] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: Yes "success going to one's head" is an idiom. 
[02:48:21] <mdogg> I doubt it, because in most legal applications the fields for "first/middle/last" are only to verify that the number entered in the Social Security Number field is the one pertaining to the applicant.  So for example, if John Smith has SSN: 123-45-6789 a flag would be thrown if Cathy Bowers used it to apply for something.
[02:48:39] <GuiToris> kurahaupo, I don't want to overemphasize how great you are .... success going to your head
[02:48:44] <mdogg> But if John Smith put his complete name in the "middle name" field but used the correct social security number, it would probably be considered.
[02:48:44] <GuiToris> I cannot connect the two clauses
[02:48:51] <kurahaupo> It's about allowing past successes to make one over confident, especially when those past successes were largely down to luck
[02:49:25] <GuiToris> if this is 'success' at all
[02:49:49] <GuiToris> I just hope you understand what I'm trying to say
[02:50:22] <kurahaupo> s/thrown/raised/
[02:50:22] <chat> kurahaupo thinks mdogg meant to say: I doubt it, because in most legal applications the fields for "first/middle/last" are only to verify that the number entered in the Social Security Number field is the one pertaining to the applicant.

[03:33:46] <blkshp> Don't buy a humvee
[03:34:27] <blkshp> our vehicles usually get tested at high speeds over cobbles. If they fall apart, they're not allowed.
[03:34:37] <el> oh the vehicle was fine
[03:34:46] <el> idk how my skull was by the end
[03:34:51] <blkshp> xD
[03:36:07] <mdogg> I've been to Ireland.  Haven't been to England yet.  
[03:37:05] <blkshp> I've never been to Ireland
[03:37:22] <mdogg> You should check it out sometime bro.
[03:37:24] <el> How? You're like, right there.
[03:37:27] <mdogg> You're right there.
[03:37:43] <LjL> well he's been in ireland but not to ireland
[03:37:56] <LjL> evidently!
[03:38:47] <GuiToris> I know.... there's a program called mediainfo. I created a script that opens media files with mediainfo so I could examine their structure. I wanted to know what verb I should use with 'mediainfo'
[03:38:50] <mdogg> I've been to Northern Ireland which is much different than Ireland.  So I guess I can say I have been to the U.K.  
[03:39:21] <GuiToris> open in mediainfo, open with mediainfo ... or something else?
[03:39:30] <Me-me> Poor Ireland.
[03:39:59] <GuiToris> extract info with mediainfo
[03:40:02] <GuiToris> that's even worse
[03:40:21] <Me-me> Forced to stay with England because they wanted EU membership, and then forced to leave the EU because of brexit.
[03:40:32] <Me-me> GuiToris: "Open in" and "open with" are both equally valid, I feel.
[03:40:41] <mdogg> GuiToris: "Open With <mediainfo>" assumes that you are going to use mediainfo to open the program.  Actually, openin kind of means the same thing. 
[03:40:42] <mdogg> Yeah.
[03:41:23] <Me-me> "With" implies it's a tool, whereas "in" suggests it's an environment (e.g. an open program).
[03:42:00] <GuiToris> then I think I should use 'with' in this case
[03:42:04] <GuiToris> thank you very much :)
[03:42:08] <Me-me> Happy to help.
[03:42:09] <mdogg> Me-me: Ireland became a part of the EU with most countries when that took place.  They have nothing to do with Brexit.
[03:42:52] <blkshp> Well Ireland isn't Britain.
[03:43:05] <Me-me> Well, now they have to re-apply, is the thing.
[03:43:08] <blkshp> Should have been called UKexit

[03:53:19] <mdogg> I really don't care for Richard Hammond. 
[03:54:04] <mdogg> It might be cool to hang out with Chris Evans, though.
[03:54:16] <Me-me> He's probably not a bad guy but it seems clear to me that his main ambition in life is to be famous at whatever.
[03:54:22] <Me-me> Hammond, I mean.
[03:54:34] <mdogg> I don't think he's a bad guy..
[03:54:41] <mdogg> But I get that same feeling..
[03:56:03] <mdogg> I do like Jeremy Clarkson, too.  But I wouldn't want to hang out with him.  I don't reckon he and I have much in common or even much that we could relate about.
[03:56:48] <TimMc> blkshp: What was that place in the UK where the accent sounds US-Southern?
[03:56:51] <Me-me> Clarkson is that one obnoxious friend that livens up the party but that you wouldn't want to spend one-on-one time with.
[03:58:21] <mdogg> Me-me: I could spend time with him - even over night.  I don't really think he's all that obnoxious..
[03:58:25] <blkshp> I suppose you could say Yorkshire could be categorised as having a certain drawl but not sure if it, or any, could be considered that similar (though I don't know all of them).
[03:59:47] <mdogg> I just think that if I could choose anybody in the U.K. to go have a few beers with, I'd choose James May and Chris Evans first.  Then Jeremy.  After that, I'd probably choose the Queen.
[04:00:44] <mdogg> Which pub does the queen prefer, I wonder..
[04:01:36] <mdogg> She probably does her drinking at The Cavern Club at 10 Mathew Street.
[04:01:36] <Me-me> mdogg: I mean, I'm reading the controversies section on Clarkson's wikipedia page, which has four large subsections.
[04:02:53] <mdogg> Me-me: Hmm.. I am not into controversy.  I just want to leave people alone and be left alone.
[04:03:38] <mdogg> I don't even want to be on TV.  Though I do think a career as an announcer (voice over) would be hella cool.
[04:04:21] <mdogg> I don't want to be immediately identifiable, though, like people on TV or in film.  
[04:04:59] <Me-me> Aye. I would never ask for celebrity unless it came with a significant amount of power to offset the scrutiny.

[12:06:48] <GuiToris> (also tell me if it's not any better)
[12:07:05] <Me-me> Analyse is fine. Using the z is american spelling, just for the record.
[12:09:03] <GuiToris> I usually see *ze in programs, there's one program that uses Maximise and it looks odd
[12:10:19] <GuiToris> so is it, analyse WITH mediainfo  (just like open WITH mediainfo, we discussed yesterday WITH is better than IN)?
