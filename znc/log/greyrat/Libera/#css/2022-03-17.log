[10:57:16] <undefined_bob> why is it so difficult to force the browser to download a pdf instead of opening it in the browser?
[10:57:24] <undefined_bob> and good morning
[10:58:07] <undefined_bob> HTML5 has a download tag but that doesnt seems to work for me because my website isn't html5, I guess
[10:58:46] <undefined_bob> I gonna try some php scripts today but thats annoying
[11:00:31] <jargon> undefined_bob, pdf's can contain malicious data. The browser scans them first for any inconsistencies.
[11:01:06] <undefined_bob> every file can contain bad code, I guess
[11:02:31] <undefined_bob> I have a list on a website where users can download files like .xls .doc and .pdf. All are fine beside .pdf because the browser open them instead of prompting the download dialog which he does for every non .pdf file

[11:11:39] <undefined_bob> but I tro
[11:11:59] <undefined_bob> sorry. but I tried various versions of it
[11:12:38] <hmw[at]> undefined_bob: Checking. Also, if you force the download, you take away the option to actually view it in the browser, which you shouldn't do. The user can always right click to force a download.
[11:13:13] <undefined_bob> yes but no. the porpose of the whole page is that users download files
[11:13:29] <undefined_bob> they need to download them because the files are for sending via emails
[11:14:01] <undefined_bob> normal users dont know about that right click
[11:14:46] <hmw[at]> undefined_bob: It works on my local server, that indicates you have some mistake. Not sure, what.
[11:15:18] <undefined_bob> I know that it normally works
[11:15:40] <undefined_bob> I guess its because it an intranet page without using a server at all
[11:16:43] <undefined_bob> its located in a windows folder and the link is like file:///C:/mypage/index.html
[11:17:17] <undefined_bob> maybe strupid question but do I have to specify in my file if I wanna use html5?
[11:18:12] <hmw[at]> <!DOCTYPE html> makes it html5. file:// might be a reason, try it on an actual https server. Downloading a file from a file doesn't make sense really, right? :)

[11:21:04] <hmw[at]> You can't serve a web site without a server either. You will eventually have to upload your page. file:// has been nerfed due to security issues.
[11:22:08] <undefined_bob> it all works well beside the pdf thing
[11:22:14] <hmw[at]> Which I hate. I used to have my users download graphical assets, put them on their disk and tell my browser game the location, so I can include graphics via file://
[11:22:30] <hmw[at]> undefined_bob: Trust me. Using file:// is not working with a lot of things.
[11:22:36] <hmw[at]> Not sure about the download though
[11:22:56] <undefined_bob> the page only contain a few tables with download links

[11:24:39] <hmw[at]> Fire your boss.
[11:24:54] <hmw[at]> I think it must be a CORS issue
[11:25:03] <hmw[at]> Chrome no longer allows cross domain downloads
[11:25:25] <hmw[at]> Maybe you can convince your boss to let you install a web server
[11:27:35] <undefined_bob> its not cross domain
[11:28:19] <undefined_bob> and no one use chrome here
[11:28:29] <hmw[at]> It is just a hunch. As mentioned, they nerfed file:// because it opens the user up to malware
[11:29:37] <undefined_bob> I dont think thats the reason why the browser opens .pdf instead of downloading them

[13:18:00] <Selvvir> jargon, Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
[13:19:10] <hmw[at]> It is always a good idea to repeatedly "distill" one's code down to the minimum. When working on a larger web page, I do this about once a day or more often.
[13:19:30] <FunkyBob> you can't have span as a direct child of table
[13:19:36] <hmw[at]> That too
[13:19:46] <FunkyBob> only caption, col, colspan, tr, thead, tbody, and tfoot

[13:20:52] <jargon> Why is my text bleeding behind the navigation pane? http://puzzlum.org/repo/

[20:29:22] <bin> i feel like ive done this before but i cant find it so i feel insane. if ive got a ul and i want it to split into 2 columns when there's more than a certain number i can use flexbox for this but i have to set a height or something right? column-count doesnt work because it's based on the number in the list, not a fixed number of columns (e.g. if there are 3 it's 1 column, if there are 12 there's maybe
[20:29:24] <bin> 3 columns)
