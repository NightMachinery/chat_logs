[00:00:10] <GreenJello> then you're not passing what you think you're passing
[00:00:16] <teut> yes I want to do {...props}   using a map
[00:01:15] <teut> hmm, I have to think about the problem, I did console.log but that didnt give me any insights
[00:01:54] <ljharb> teut: object spread is like Object.assign, why would you want to use a map for that
[00:02:01] <silly> https://replit.com/@Silly-SS/MediumblueExaltedDeprecatedsoftware#index.js
[00:02:14] <silly> teut, ^
[00:02:20] <GreenJello> teut, did you log the thing you're passing to Object.values?
[00:02:22] <ljharb> teut: you can do `Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(input).map(([key, value]) => [newKey, newValue]))` tho
[00:03:53] <teut> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/ed169cf5e8d8cf9ca5d131dd79199bea/image.png
[00:04:07] <teut> oh yes, I didnt observe it
[00:04:24] <sheetjs> so this old format DBF represents numbers as fixed decimals.  A test file from 1983 managed to have two empty rows
[00:04:41] <sheetjs> in those rows, one numeric field has "     0.000"
[00:04:48] <teut> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/8138569a817b83f084f940ba395693a4/image.png
[00:04:57] <sheetjs> the other has "      .   "
[00:05:05] <teut> actually I console.log   the  object  not the    Object.values(...)
[00:05:22] <sheetjs> should the latter be translated to #N/A, an empty cell, or 0?
[00:05:24] <GreenJello> so you're importing it incorrectly
[00:05:25] <teut> I used your import thing
[00:05:32] <GreenJello> you haven't show the import statement

[00:06:38] <teut> regarding the Object.assign, in react  {...props} is the default way to do things

[00:07:48] <wroathe> GreenJello: A hundred million
[00:08:00] <celphi> You can spoof the REFERER with using a host file wroathe
[00:08:01] <wroathe> GreenJello: I have the writing part scripted
[00:08:19] <silly> eslint-airbnb-config disallows {...props}
[00:08:22] <wroathe> celphi: Hrm, I'm unclear on how that would work. Care to explain?
[00:08:52] <celphi> yeah just start up a local server - add a host file pointing to where you want to spoof
[00:08:55] <teut> silly , currently I m just starting with react, so not using that extension
[00:09:04] <GreenJello> child's play. I change the codebase between 2 spaces and tabs daily, getting tends of thousands of insertions
[00:09:14] <teut> it is too much trouble to use that
[00:09:16] <wroathe> GreenJello: Oooo. Protip.

[00:09:42] <teut> I m saying about airbnb
[00:09:55] <silly> oic
[00:10:05] <celphi> like if i want my referrer to say gooogle i just change my host file to point to google
[00:10:22] <teut> it doesnt compile the code if I have unused imports
[00:10:53] <teut> I often try out components from semantic, switch back and forth
[00:10:54] <wroathe> celphi: Referer is set by the client though?
[00:11:08] <wroathe> celphi: An incoming request to the server will have a client-specified referer header

[00:14:15] <celphi> create a host file point your localhost to whatever.com, then on jsfiddle have it make a request to your local server and the referrer will be whatever.com
[00:16:19] <wroathe> celphi: So you're doing something like <script src="http://localhost:3421/resource.js"></script> and you're saying that the browser is actually using an alias you specified in a hostfile instead of localhost:3xxx for the referer?

However,. if you make a localwebserver and you make that same request,. the referrer will return whatever your host file says your url is
[00:19:45] <ljharb> right, referrers aren't reliable
[00:19:59] <celphi> sure- but i didnt know you could spoof with hosts file

[00:20:54] <celphi> im definitely interested in hearing this
[00:21:02] <wroathe> celphi: "if you make a localwebserver and you make that same request," so rather than a web browser requesting that script from your first server, you have second server requesting that script
[00:21:21] <wroathe> celphi: And that second server is setting the referer based on something in the hosts file?
[00:21:28] <celphi> right
[00:21:32] <ljharb> celphi: the full list isn't interesting; it just means that like the user agent, the referrer is never reliable, but most people won't fake it
[00:21:40] <wroathe> celphi: So there's no browser involved at all in that exchange?
[00:22:26] <celphi> wroathe: there is a browser involved
[00:22:35] <celphi> on the local server
[00:23:22] <wroathe> web browser -> first server, and then second server -> first server. I'm saying that the first part of that equation has no bearing on the second part
[00:23:27] <celphi> user agent you can manually change you cant do that with referrer ljharb

[00:26:57] <ljharb> celphi: sure, not with ajax
[00:26:57] <wroathe> celphi: Right, but that's not the request being "spoofed". The request being spoofed (according to you) is the one between the second local web server you've got and your first server
[00:27:22] <wroathe> celphi: Is your local web server acting as a reverse proxy for the first server in this situation?

[01:23:54] <matsaman> merpnderp: so there's a relationship between people using crap chat systems _and_ crap libraries? =)
[01:24:05] <merpnderp> *burn!*
[01:24:10] <seed0> irc is fine, i think it comes down to preference and what friends use, it use to be AIM/MSN back in the day as an alternative to IRC, now it's just discord primarily due to clever marketing (gamers) and its features (video/voice chatting) capabilities
[01:24:18] <systemfault> I switched to chrome because it was faster than Mozilla.. had built-in dev tools that worked properly..
[01:24:33] <ljharb> matsaman: proprietary software can be just fine, it's not inherently junk. discord's UX is junk, and that has nothing to do with the openness of their code
[01:24:46] <merpnderp> There are 39 people on vue IRC and 5000+ on Discord.
[01:24:47] <matsaman> it's funny, originally Firefox's whole thing was to have fewer features baked in, and more extensions, than previous Mozilla browsers
[01:24:56] <ljharb> merpnderp: that speaks to vue, not to irc vs discord.
[01:24:58] <matsaman> ljharb: it's theoretically possible =)
[01:25:08] <merpnderp> ljharb: But the same ratio for React.
[01:25:15] <wintersky> fortunetly we have good irc clients nowday, therefore irc prevails
[01:25:17] <ljharb> merpnderp: again, that's about how the project supports and markets it

[01:25:20] <merpnderp> I can't find a just Javascript Discord server
[01:25:23] <ljharb> merpnderp: the react core team pushes discord
[01:25:24] <matsaman> and now extensions like Pederick's web developer are harder to use in Firefox =P
[01:25:31] <ljharb> merpnderp: that's the only reason there's more people there
[01:25:39] <systemfault> ljharb: Unlike... IRC?
[01:25:43] <systemfault> IRC sucks..
[01:25:50] <wintersky> also, google uses nasty tricks to keep chrome domination
[01:25:56] <matsaman> systemfault: you don't like this conversation you're having on IRC? =P
[01:25:58] <ljharb> systemfault: yes, unlike irc. if the react team supported and sent people here, there'd be tons here.

[01:26:53] <sheetjs> the reason is because the README advertises the discord but not the IRC

[01:28:08] <matsaman> well, what's he going to say
[01:28:14] <matsaman> "I hate my new job I just sought out" =P
[01:28:31] <matsaman> it's nice it hasn't turned that way immediately when he got there, yeah
[01:28:32] <systemfault> Or they can download discord... make a simple account and join whatever server they want, they get voice chat for free and screen share.

[01:29:37] <seed0> systemfault: thats not really a great argument, web based irc's are not particularly difficult to navigate (mibbit comes to mind), you can usually set your nick and connect in one go

[01:31:47] <systemfault> lol
[01:31:50] <sheetjs> wintersky: "open source" is hosted on a closed source platform
[01:31:54] <systemfault> no, they voted for the best product.
[01:31:58] <systemfault> close or not.
[01:32:00] <systemfault> *closed
[01:32:08] <wintersky> they made it proprietary because they found it better for their business
[01:32:25] <sheetjs> but the point is that, given the choice, people still chose proprietary
[01:32:28] <wintersky> it used to be open source
[01:32:33] <sheetjs> heck, people cheerlead when open source projects turn closed
[01:32:40] <theskillwithin> systemfault i think i figured out why he did that,  hes building a js based irc thing thats probably a competitor
[01:32:54] <systemfault> sheetjs: being proprietary isn't even part of the equation I think
[01:33:49] <sheetjs> the proprietary solutions can trivially build upon open source efforts and be "superior"
[01:33:51] <wintersky> and if you want all of it's features it's $5/month
[01:33:58] <merpnderp> discord.js is proprietary?
[01:34:05] <sheetjs> discord the service is proprietary
[01:34:29] <Poboy> It's Discord time!  *dance moves*
[01:34:32] <merpnderp> Yeah, on the freemium model.
[01:34:39] <systemfault> wintersky: You're not handicaped at all without the extra features.
[01:34:45] <merpnderp> You basically get 100% of Discord for free. You have to pay if you want animated gifs.
[01:34:58] <systemfault> I don't care if I can only stream my desktop at 720p instead of 1080p@60fps
[01:35:14] <merpnderp> I have the premium version because we use it for work.
[01:35:15] <wintersky> well you can only use up to 2 networks and you're not online 24/7
[01:35:27] <wintersky> that's fine to me tbh

[01:39:29] <systemfault> Seriously... he can just keep eating things from his feet.
[01:39:43] <wintersky> the only proprietary piece of software on my debian is firmware
[01:39:49] <merpnderp> he spoke at my university once. it was not a great experience.
[01:39:57] <merpnderp> he almost got arrested at the airport when he left.
[01:40:14] <wintersky> but that's kinda "you either want your computer to work or not" kind of situation
[01:40:39] <wintersky> heh i remember gates being attacked at belgium
[01:41:01] <wintersky> i don't think he travels abroad since then
[01:41:51] <merpnderp> I remember a write up from a professor who had to dive him from the airport in Hawaii. The whole piece takes place as he's driving and he mentions at what state and manner RMS is losing his mind over traffic.
[01:42:12] <merpnderp> At one point I think the article said something about him having some sort of altercation with little girl in the car over.
[01:42:21] <merpnderp> s/dive/drive/
[01:42:50] <merpnderp> That article fit perfectly with what my professor had to say about the drive to the airport.
[01:42:54] <merpnderp> And the altercation there.
[01:43:08] <systemfault> Even EMACS... he basically stole the code from Gosling (Yeah... the evil Java dude)
[01:43:53] <merpnderp> I think he's someone who can't come to grips that not everyone sees the same injustices in the world that he does and not everyone agrees on the best way to solve them, and he can't deal with that.

[01:44:56] <systemfault> Tech news? I still prefer HN
[01:45:11] <wintersky> i use vim anyways lol
[01:46:02] <matsaman> ah, fair enough
[01:46:15] <wintersky> and gedit
[01:46:21] <wintersky> because i'm a gnome lover
[01:46:55] <merpnderp> There's evil mode in emacs
[01:46:57] <merpnderp> But what's the point.
[01:47:06] <matsaman> systemfault: is this the first person who ever didn't realize how licensing works? =P
[01:48:04] <jaawerth> merpnderp: well, if you like vim but also want to make use of the emacs ecosystem (the whole "great OS with a mediocre editor" joke..) it's a good compromise. I'm too deep into (neo)vim to go back to emacs and reproduce all my custom stuffs though
[01:48:25] <merpnderp> jaawerth: yeah, I'm vim for life.
[01:48:32] <merpnderp> my dot file has too much in it.
[01:48:35] <jaawerth> I mean there are even people who use emacs as their window manager lol
[01:48:44] <merpnderp> I just don't care enough
[01:48:53] <merpnderp> And really RMS put me off emacs.
[01:49:04] <wintersky> i don't even code much
[01:49:13] <wintersky> and if i do it's gedit mostly
[01:49:33] <wintersky> i reserve vim to administer my system
[01:49:58] <wintersky> which rarely happens because it's debian and it just keeps on working
[01:50:16] <systemfault> VSCode is better than gedit.
[01:50:27] <merpnderp> RMS talks about being under the thumb of corporations, but he lost his mind because a plane was late and kept screaming at the ticket lady as if she could do anything until the police came and then he kept screaming until he was threatened with arrest. I didn't want to use an editor that was under his thumb.
[01:50:30] <wintersky> gedit is simple, i agreee
[01:50:41] <matsaman> still explains it pretty well: https://external-preview.redd.it/1Y9bYk52Dus3jlPnadjP1IvgnWRB_IyEjFIlUY-CfoA.png?auto=webp&s=70a171b0991e9dc0dac50ade71063773c881a2ea
[01:50:43] <wintersky> however it's well integrated with gnome
[01:50:51] <jaawerth> and evil mode is probably the best vim emulation out there. the only other decent one being, surprisingly, IDEA and other jetbrains stuff
[01:51:00] <wintersky> and as i said i love gnome
[01:51:08] <jaawerth> well maybe not "only" but most of 'em are super limited
[01:51:22] <jaawerth> gedit's not bad. I want more/want my beloved vim bindings, but it's not bad
[01:51:29] <merpnderp> Jetbrains and VSCode both have excellent VIM emulation.
[01:51:35] <merpnderp> Jetbrains is definitely best thoguh
[01:51:40] <onosendi> jaawerth: what WM do you use?
[01:51:51] <merpnderp> But jet brains went with a subscription model.
[01:51:54] <systemfault> VSCode can use neovim directly
[01:52:00] <merpnderp> So now I use VSCode when not using vim directly

[01:53:04] <wintersky> gnome all the way
[01:53:16] <jaawerth> awesomewm because it's lua-based, so I can customize it in fennel-lang and eventually tightly integrate it with other fennel/lua codebases like neovim and such (I wouldn't mind someday cooking up a neovim-based equivalent to exwm that way), otherwise I'd probably go with i3
[01:53:30] <onosendi> wintersky: I can't not use a tiling WM.
[01:53:49] <wintersky> well than gnome is not for you
[01:53:53] <onosendi> :P
[01:54:08] <wintersky> i used to use dwm
[01:54:11] <wintersky> was cute
[01:54:13] <jaawerth> wintersky: I don't hate gnome but I gave up on it after it kept intercepting some of my preferred alt+ keybindings with its context menu shortcuts, and disabling the ways to get around it
[01:54:25] <onosendi> jaawerth: do you use neovim?
[01:54:28] <jaawerth> I do
[01:54:45] <wintersky> jaawerth: gnome is designed in a way to make you learn using it's workflow
[01:54:50] <onosendi> jaawerth: Builtin lsp or, CoC?
[01:54:57] <wintersky> if you want to customize everything use kde
[01:55:07] <jaawerth> wintersky: right, it's not a big fan of customization, hence why I don't use gnome (or kde for that matter)
[01:55:16] <buu> Open protocols are so important
[01:55:17] <jaawerth> cinnamn and mate also dont' have that problem though
[01:55:21] <buu> I can forgive rms being nutty
[01:55:43] <jaawerth> alt+ shortcuts are supposed to be customizable, especially from a terminal. it's a sin for a DE to override that

[01:56:59] <merpnderp> The irc vue channel is fairly active.
[01:57:04] <wintersky> basically it supresses windows
[01:57:06] <buu> Yeah

[02:25:41] <xochilpili> https://codesandbox.io/s/sweet-currying-0vf35?file=/src/animals.ts < when i console log to "this" refering to the instance, returns correclty Cats, but the value of location is not setted in the cat implementation
[02:27:17] <jaawerth> well setTimeout isn't a promise-returning function so async/await won't do anything with them
[02:27:24] <jaawerth> you'd need to wrap setTimeout in a promise
[02:27:48] <xochilpili> jaawerth, i have tried with Promise.all(setTimeout(() => {}); but still same behaviour
[02:28:09] <xochilpili> https://codesandbox.io/s/sweet-currying-0vf35?file=/src/animals.ts < jaawerth take a look
[02:28:26] <jaawerth> Promise.all works on an array/iterable of promises, which setTimeout doesn't return either. setTimeout just returns the timer ID that can be used with clearTimeout to cancel it
[02:28:50] <xochilpili> jaawerth, sorry, bad typing here. I meant Promise.resolve instaead of Promise.all

[02:30:10] <xochilpili> jaawerth, oh, do you mean to wrap the this.location.x+=location.x inside of a promise ?
[02:30:24] <jaawerth> you'd want something like `const pTimeout = (f, ms, ...args) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(f(...args)), ms));`, and then use pTimeout the same way you'd use setTimeout
[02:30:27] *** Joins: Sven_vB (~sven@user/sven-vb/x-2094958)
[02:30:28] <jaawerth> then you can await it
[02:31:32] <xochilpili> jaawerth, i've use await only to check if that would work. but it doesnt. The only thing that im trying to understand it's why that this.location.x += location.x; it's not changing the location property of cat (instantiated)
[02:32:24] <jaawerth> because the other stuff runs before the setTimeout executes

[02:38:51] <jaawerth> xochilpili: the one on line 6 runs before the one in your walk fn though
[02:39:18] <xochilpili> jaawerth, shows you {location: x: 1, y: 3} but because of this: https://codesandbox.io/s/sweet-currying-0vf35?file=/src/animals.ts Line: 22
[02:40:02] <jaawerth> yes, because that console.log on line 22 is running after setting it. the one on line 6 in index.ts runs before that setTimeout triggers
[02:40:06] <xochilpili> there's a console.log inside of setTimeout << just to debug, but that's not what expected

[02:58:46] <sheetjs> oh wroathe what are your thoughts on literature
[03:00:24] <jaawerth> I generally think that literature is good *nods sagely*
[03:00:52] <sheetjs> i saw the future and it was bleak
[03:01:13] <sheetjs> there's this book, "the file formats handbook", which had a wealth of information about old and obscure file formats
[03:02:20] <jaawerth> lol, which current formats do you expect in future editions
[03:02:29] <sheetjs> not like that
[03:02:29] * jaawerth looks at jsx
[03:02:49] <jaawerth> well I have no idea where you're going with this lol
[03:02:53] <sheetjs> it was weird reading the preface, the author in 1987 had similar motivations to what I had at the ideation of sheetjs
[03:03:13] <sheetjs> about data preservation and risks of losing access to decades of knowledge
[03:03:23] <sheetjs> anyway, so i reached out asking about a future revision
[03:03:38] <jaawerth> ohh you met your future self, yeah that's always rough
[03:03:40] <sheetjs> predictably, it didn't sell well
[03:04:05] <wroathe> sheetjs: I can't read
[03:04:48] <sheetjs> the author is retired now, the publishers are closed and even the domain was sold to someone else
[03:05:01] <jaawerth> at least these days there are more RFC's? though there are also more fractal snowflake proprietary formats
[03:05:30] <wroathe> jaawerth: Not all literature is good
[03:05:45] <sheetjs> but i think the mission is important
[03:06:03] <sheetjs> collecting information on these data formats, writing documentation, etc
[03:06:13] <wroathe> jaawerth: For example, the Malleus Maleficarum lead to thousands of dead suspected "witches"

[03:06:29] <jaawerth> sheetjs: oh, true, but to the point of your story it's a thankless job

[03:11:22] <wroathe> Deep wisdom happening over here
[03:11:26] <sheetjs> yeah we're moving back to the original topic
[03:11:37] <sheetjs> so there are a few options
[03:12:00] <sheetjs> either make public documentation with the help of the author or try to write the next edition of this book
[03:12:30] <sheetjs> or following the silicon valley way and create our own proprietary data format
[03:13:01] <sheetjs> wroathe: if we take that approach, you're taking the blame :P
[03:13:04] <wroathe> Well, to have any chance of preservation it will need to be digital. I suppose if the goal is knowledge retention, it doesn't really matter what format it's in
[03:13:10] * neshpion invents a proprietary processor that runs on x and y instead of 0 and 1
[03:13:27] <wroathe> sheetjs: Bring it on
[03:14:07] *** Joins: va5c0 (~vasco.nun@95.148.139.5)
[03:14:12] <jaawerth> I mean, the people making proprietary formats, isn't one of the more common reasons for them doing so in order to lock out interop with tools outside their ecosystem? so documenting it or writing a spec would be counterproductive to their aims
[03:14:14] <sheetjs> while a JS library is great, I don't think sheetjs represents knowledge retention of spreadsheet minutiae
[03:14:23] <jaawerth> otherwise just use an extensible standard
[03:14:44] <sheetjs> that was the entire motivation
[03:14:52] <sheetjs> nowadays its just siloed in saas
[03:14:59] <jaawerth> unless you mean "writing documentation for others' proprietary formats," in which case sure
[03:15:16] <wroathe> Wasn't there supposed to be a universal file system standard everyone was hot and bothered about for preserving data over a long period of time?
[03:15:24] <sheetjs> ipfs?
[03:15:25] <wroathe> ipfs
[03:15:26] <wroathe> Yeah
[03:15:44] <jaawerth> that's just the filesystem though
[03:15:48] <sheetjs> there's a difference between data and information
[03:16:06] <sheetjs> err between the bits/bytes and the underlying data
[03:16:13] <wroathe> jaawerth: yeah, but the web is a form of file system too when you think about it
[03:16:48] <wroathe> sheetjs: Maybe a wikipedia article would be the way to go
[03:16:59] <wroathe> That kind of seems like it has a bit of permanence to it
[03:17:12] <sheetjs> wiki page per format per version

[04:24:23] <l__q> hmm
[04:24:39] <entuland> n> 2 !== 2 || 1 !== 2
[04:24:39] <jellobot> (okay) true
[04:24:44] <l__q> yes
[04:24:47] <entuland> did you expect anything different?
[04:24:55] <l__q>     if (isPriv.sender !== login && isPriv.recipient !== login) {
[04:25:08] <l__q> here i have crash if im try ||
[04:25:15] <entuland> we can't tell what you would get since we don't know the contents of your variables

[04:25:28] <entuland> also, a crash?
[04:25:47] <entuland> at best you should get a console error, and even there, you must be screwing up something else
[04:26:48] <entuland> run console.log([ispriv.sender, isPriv.recipient, login]) and show us the output
[04:26:49] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.  what are the values of those vars when you're getting your unexpected result?
[04:27:02] <l__q> ("ola" !== "ola" && "aptitude" !== "ola")
[04:27:10] <l__q> this works
[04:27:13] <l__q> ("ola" !== "ola" || "aptitude" !== "ola")
[04:27:15] <l__q> this not
[04:27:16] <entuland> no, just show us the outcome of that logging
[04:27:34] <entuland> how does that not work?
[04:27:41] <robertmaxrees> that does exactly what it should...
[04:28:07] <l__q> idk now o_o in my browser console works okay
[04:28:13] <l__q> in nodejs crash
[04:28:18] <robertmaxrees> n> 'foo' !== 'foo' && 'foo' !== 'bar'

[04:28:32] <l__q> ok, i need to search a bug
[04:28:33] <hassoon> l__q: maybe you're confused
[04:28:39] <robertmaxrees> woops - but yeah.  it works as expected.
[04:28:48] <hassoon> it meanst condition1 AND condition2
[04:29:00] <hassoon> where the 2 conditions are not related
[04:29:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  if both conditions are truthy, it's true.
[04:29:45] <l__q> also and in this case is or?

[07:50:27] <mysteryhunter> sry but i feel a little
[07:50:34] <mysteryhunter> treated like a noob
[07:50:59] <theskillwithin> so the part you don't know is how to make a dropdown menu?
[07:51:02] <mysteryhunter> yea but then just the string is shown in the textarea not the picture
[07:51:11] <mysteryhunter> isnt that possible to show the emoji?

[08:07:19] <mysteryhunter> so how is that then connected with the php file of the website?
[08:07:36] <mysteryhunter> how can the php file read the js code from the other file then?
[08:07:50] <Rockwood> ajax

[08:58:15] <mysteryhunter> @ theskillwithin
[08:59:36] <Rockwood> mysteryhunter, your code is outdated in fashion
[08:59:47] <mysteryhunter> i renamed it to kommentar cause the textarea has the id kommentar and then i also renamed the utton to emojibutton

[09:00:08] <mysteryhunter> my style is my style
[09:00:33] <l__q> I love Prisma <3

[09:00:47] <l__q> Now my JS code looks so nice

[09:01:15] <mysteryhunter> theskillwithin, u still there?
[09:01:25] <mysteryhunter> did i make the emoji.js wrong?
[09:01:52] <mysteryhunter> remember the source https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/czvnm3qu/
[09:02:13] <mysteryhunter> however a button with "??" appears left of the textarea but when i click on it nothing happens
[09:04:05] <theskillwithin> line 4 is wrong emojibutton.value += '??'
[09:04:32] <theskillwithin> should be: kommentarElement.value += '??'
[09:04:43] <theskillwithin> also instead of ?? should use an emoji
[09:04:55] <theskillwithin> kommentarElement.value += '😋'
[09:05:26] <mysteryhunter> but thats copied from the source

[09:11:22] <mysteryhunter> emoji.js i mean
[09:11:42] <mysteryhunter> is it maybe because kommentarElement.value instead just kommentar.value ?
[09:13:06] <theskillwithin> kommentarElement is what you defined on line 2,  so should use that variable on line 4
[09:13:11] <mysteryhunter> or rather the 'use strict';
[09:13:11] <mysteryhunter>  at the beginning?
[09:13:29] <mysteryhunter> as u see self on the site the button brings nothing

[09:13:46] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, a big thanks again
[09:13:48] <Rockwood> cheers
[09:13:58] <theskillwithin> mysteryhunter add a console log inside the emojibutton event listener to see if it fires when u click the button
[09:14:16] <mysteryhunter> ok how do i do that?
[09:15:10] <theskillwithin> https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/czvnm3qu/1/
[09:15:57] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, what should be the way scrolling enable on click on both buttons
[09:16:05] <Rockwood> too
[09:16:23] <Rockwood> at end i will disable buttons too
[09:16:24] <theskillwithin> didn't u already have that part working at some point
[09:16:52] <Rockwood> yes scrolling works on manually
[09:17:08] <Rockwood> 'when drag the below scrolling bar
[09:17:09] <theskillwithin> mysteryhunter and if u can't see the console log in ur browsers devtools console,  then the js is probably loading before the html so need to have some logic in the js to add the event listener after the dom is ready

[15:59:55] <Lope> l__q, you should probably explain your question better.
[16:00:05] <Lope> "[{user1: true, user2: false}]" is a string yes.
[16:00:13] <Lope> Anything inside single or double quotes is a string.
[16:00:30] <Lope> or backticks.
[16:01:34] <l__q> I can insert this data to my postgres db via prisma, becouse is a invalid type
[16:01:46] <l__q> Boolean[] is to no valid
[16:01:56] <l__q> or Boolean[{}]
[16:02:24] <Lope> That's some very strange syntax you've got there.
[16:02:44] <l__q> https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-fields/working-with-scalar-lists-arrays
[16:02:56] <l__q> here only insert a array of strings
[16:03:10] <l__q> but I need to insert a array o objects
[16:03:12] <Lope> Boolean is a function. Normally you'd put your expression inside your function call as a parameter
[16:03:17] <Lope> Boolean(stuff)
[16:03:38] <Lope> Maybe try prisma support or chat group.
[16:03:44] <Lope> I doubt anyone here knows what prisma is.
[16:03:53] <Lope> read the prisma manual etc.

[22:06:18] <gehn> teut, I think the explanation you are trying to understand is likely trying to explain hoisting. and you should basically be able to ignore hoisting concerns if you stick to const and let
[22:06:45] <teut> well, I was just increasing my knowledge in js
[22:07:23] <gehn> n> foo(); function foo() { console.log('hello'); }
[22:07:24] <jellobot> (okay) hello
[22:07:40] <codebam> n> console.log('world');
[22:07:40] <jellobot> (okay) world
[22:07:46] <gehn> n> foo(); const foo = () => console.log('hello');
[22:07:47] <jellobot> (fail) ReferenceError: Cannot access 'foo' before initialization
[22:07:56] <gehn> teut, basically that's hoisting ^
[22:08:15] <gehn> if you use const, hoisting doesn't work in the first place, so you don't have to think about it
[22:08:18] <Rockwood> n> goo(); function goo() { console.log('hello, How Are You?'); }
[22:08:19] <jellobot> (okay) hello, How Are You?
[22:08:35] <gehn> n> const foo = () => console.log('hello'); foo();
[22:08:36] <jellobot> (okay) hello
[22:08:51] <teut> hmm, something is to be understood here but I dont know what exactly
[22:09:25] <codebam> oh that's cool so you can trigger an evaluation if you don't use const
[22:09:31] <teut> cannot access foo?
[22:09:40] <teut> who is accessing foo?
[22:09:50] <gehn> well, kind of uncool actually, as it can lead to subtle and difficult to debug problems, so it's best avoided
[22:09:57] <teut> ok
[22:10:14] <onosendi> When doing something like `create-next-app`, and it says "Need to install the following packages: create-next-app, Ok to proceed" where is this being downloaded/installed? It's not globally, because if I run it in a different directory it wants to install it again.
[22:10:25] <codebam> n> hello(); console.log(' world') let foo = () => console.log('hello');
[22:10:26] <jellobot> (fail) SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier

[22:10:35] <gehn> onosendi, $PWD/node_modules I would assume
[22:10:38] <codebam> so I can't do that?
[22:10:40] <codebam> hmmmm
[22:10:55] <codebam> how did it work when gehn did it?
[22:11:01] <gehn> codebam, it didn't
[22:11:05] <gehn> n> foo(); const foo = () => console.log('hello');
[22:11:06] <jellobot> (fail) ReferenceError: Cannot access 'foo' before initialization
[22:11:12] <codebam> the first time when you used function without const though
[22:11:19] <gehn> because hoisting
[22:11:32] <codebam> did I do hoisting wrong?
[22:11:40] <gehn> const and let don't hoist
[22:11:47] <gehn> which is a good thing
[22:11:48] <codebam> oh okay
[22:11:52] <codebam> var?
[22:11:58] <codebam> n> hello(); console.log(' world'); var foo = () => console.log('hello');
[22:11:58] <jellobot> (fail) ReferenceError: hello is not defined
[22:11:59] <onosendi> gehn: hmm. After running `create-next-app`, after installation it says "A new version of `create-next-app` is available! You can update by running: npm i -g create-next-app". Why wouldn't it download the new version by default?
[22:12:14] <gehn> n> console.log(a); var a = 3;
[22:12:14] <Dorward> var hoists the variable declaration but not the value assignment
[22:12:14] <jellobot> (okay) undefined

[22:14:43] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[22:15:03] <gehn> that's part of the purpose of package and lock files, to enforce that your versions *don't* automagically upgrade on you without you realizing it
[22:16:50] <onosendi> gehn: How would I upgrade `create-next-app` without installing it globally?
[22:16:59] <gehn> also if you installed create-react-app with -g then it did get installed globally
[22:17:17] <gehn> though exactly where "globally" means is going to be different depending on your system

[22:19:00] <gehn> onosendi, the first step would be uninstalling create-react-app from the global packages
[22:19:06] <gehn> then just run the install again but don't use -g
[22:19:19] <sheetjs> asterisk is the classic
[22:19:36] <sheetjs> buu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)
[22:20:19] <onosendi> gehn: it's not installed globally. And, if I `npm init -y; npm i create-next-app; create-next-app --use-npm .` I get an error, saying node_modules and package.json is in conflict.
[22:20:46] <gehn> onosendi, I dunno sorry, I've never actually used any of the create-*-app packages
[22:21:07] <gehn> I just set up my build however I want, typically using browserify, node-sass and a handful of package.json scripts to glue it all together
[22:21:14] <gehn> concurrently also comes in handy there
[22:21:51] <onosendi> gehn: np, thanks :)
[22:22:11] <gehn> also if "next" means "Next JS" the thing that tries to help you run isomorphic react (both server and client) then I doubly don't know
[22:22:22] <gehn> I'm sure it will have its own unique set of quirks
[22:23:36] <gehn> at a guess, I would think create-next-app might expect to be installed in the global scope, and relatedly might expect that you explicitly do *not* yet have a package.json, meaning you have *not* yet run npm init
[22:23:47] <gehn> I would imagine that's part of what most of those create* packages do for you
[22:24:28] <buu> sheetjs: I mean, yes, in theory, but way too complex

[22:26:15] <gehn> if you use npx, you can skip that first part I believe
[22:26:29] <gehn> npx should auto temporarily download the package if you don't have it yet

[22:42:28] <merpnderp> I don't care what anyone says, sqlite is by far the biggest joy to work with of any database I've ever used.
[22:44:06] <codebam> merpnderp: true but performance is meh compared to database servers
[22:44:06] <gehn> sqlite is great for some use cases
[22:44:28] <merpnderp> meh performance? I've never heard of sqlite being slow.
[22:44:29] <gehn> it's lacking a lot of features though, like I think it doesn't even have e.g. SIN() and COS() so you can't do vincenty or haversine
[22:44:40] <merpnderp> I mean if you do a lot of writing from many different processes, then yes.
[22:44:59] <codebam> you should just use a database plugin so that you can migrate from sqlite to whatever other database when you need to
[22:45:11] <gehn> also I wouldn't want to use sqlite for a traditional highly concurrent system like a node.js web service

[23:14:01] <gehn> I mean, yes technically sqlite has concurrency, but I still wouldn't choose it for anything remotely resembling a normal web application (or even abnormal ones)
[23:14:34] <neshpion> but it's so ezpz
[23:14:52] <gehn> sqlite is really great for somewhere that you need or want an integrated packaged db thing locally because A) you can't reasonbly ask your users to install Postgres on their own and or B) the client may or may not have internet access
[23:15:14] <gehn> so, traditional C++ desktop applications, or maybe sometimes video games are a great use case for sqlite. also some mobile apps (probably)
[23:15:40] <gehn> but if you *don't* have those restrictions, like... I don't know why I would choose sqlite over Postgres
[23:16:52] <gehn> postgres has so many features. I would never want to choose MySQL over postgres for that reason alone.
[23:17:17] <gehn> pubsub, hstore, jsonb, ltree, pl/sql pl/js pl/python and the list goes on
[23:17:47] <gehn> much less choose sqlite over postgres if it's reasonable to choose postgres
[23:19:30] <codebam> using docker-compose it's easy to setup postgres with a schema
[23:19:56] * neshpion sets up his postgres skooma
[23:20:27] <gehn> I find it easy to setup postgres on most any linux machine, but that's partly down to familiarity
[23:20:29] <gehn> unfortunately actually postgres in docker is currently a bit shit
[23:20:44] <gehn> there's not really support for using volume mounts as your data store, because reasons
[23:21:17] <gehn> mysql does allow this, but postgres expects some magic from the db root dir, almost like /proc or /dev I think
[23:21:49] <gehn> I mean I think you can still do it, but it may or may not break and isn't supported
[23:22:28] <gehn> docker and kubernetes is overrated for 90% of the world anyway
[23:22:33] <systemfault> With SQLite, there's nothing to setup though.
[23:23:04] <gehn> also there are services like Amazon's RDS you can use instead of managing your own docker images
[23:23:10] <systemfault> A website with 5 concurrent user, 3 of those being bots doesn't need that much
[23:23:45] <gehn> sure, requirements help dictate what is and isn't viable
[23:23:55] <gehn> but I still wouldn't default to using sqlite unless it was required
[23:23:56] <codebam> true amazon rds or managed databases work really well
[23:24:12] <codebam> sqlite is only really good for very small projects
[23:24:20] <gehn> I wouldn't say very small
[23:24:28] <codebam> or you can use sqlite as a cache
