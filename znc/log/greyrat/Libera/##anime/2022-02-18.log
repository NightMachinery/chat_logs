[00:00:14] <teus> i have plenty of ispropyl alcohol, acetone and methylene chloride
[00:00:16] <MootPoot> if your computer uses less then 30w overall ( including the display ) = no sales tax

[00:00:47] <MootPoot> lol  butter, its okay
[00:00:48] <ButterNoodle> how about make electric cheaper

[00:02:29] <MootPoot> teus: not really, a M$ surface is a glorified tablet
[00:02:29] <ButterNoodle> kinda the opposite of going bareback
[00:02:40] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: 2tb ssd ez
[00:02:43] <MootPoot> this thing can do pretty much a intel mac can do
[00:02:51] <teus> some PC that consumes less than 100W at peak power is pretty "ecological"
[00:02:56] <Bco1981> i was sitting here piecing togheter a i5-12500T
[00:03:06] <ButterNoodle> the T is for tiddies
[00:03:06] <Bco1981> just to see price
[00:03:29] <ButterNoodle> I almost priced one the other day.. buy why
[00:03:39] <ButterNoodle> my 11th gen still has that new pc smell
[00:04:09] <Bco1981> i need to replace a old amd athlon 4x 860k
[00:04:25] <Bco1981> would be nice withe low power cpu with igpu

[00:08:45] <ButterNoodle> wdym?
[00:08:52] <MootPoot> but the point is not to qualify older computers

[00:08:57] <MootPoot> you've already paid the tax on them
[00:09:01] <teus> you cant MootPoot 
[00:09:16] <teus> newer pc's are just more efficient
[00:09:20] <MootPoot> the point is to incentivice the creation of newer under 30w classes
[00:09:22] <ButterNoodle> u have to have taxes... how will the poor eat, how will my roads get fixed
[00:09:25] <teus> and taxing efficiency is a bit harder than taxing wattage

[00:13:39] <MootPoot> flat tax?

[00:14:06] <ButterNoodle> fat tiddies are just fat in a skin sack.. utterly disgusting

[00:14:10] *** Joins: luke-jr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr)
[00:14:25] <ButterNoodle> and fucking with the market with tax incentives is bad
[00:14:25] <MootPoot> a company left on its own will make shit in the dirtiest, cheapest way it can
[00:14:42] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: then what would u fuck the market with
[00:14:56] <ButterNoodle> u dont think they will make more dog shit that will get tax exemptions because they sell better using child labor in china?
[00:15:21] <MootPoot> I don't follow

[00:15:44] <mixfix41> theres tax breaks for occupations
[00:15:46] <MootPoot> yeah but people are two faced
[00:15:52] <MootPoot> as a whole
[00:15:54] <mixfix41> and if they are in a marriage 
[00:15:55] <ButterNoodle> yea I'm not

[00:16:17] <ButterNoodle> gimme the biggest, energy consuming piece of hardware to get me off faster..
[00:16:22] <MootPoot> pay 10-25% more for stuff
[00:16:44] <ButterNoodle> controlling markets with taxes is akin to communism.. I dont respect it

[00:17:10] <MootPoot> so I dont see that relation
[00:17:11] <ButterNoodle> drive that shit in a ditch
[00:17:26] <ButterNoodle> yea cause the gov controls the market directly
[00:17:32] <ButterNoodle> not indirectly with tax
[00:17:36] <MootPoot> yes
[00:18:14] <ButterNoodle> if u fuck a fleshlight stuck in a pigs ass. are u fucking the pig?
[00:18:25] <MootPoot> the fleshlight is fucking the pig
[00:18:29] <ButterNoodle> see
[00:18:32] <ButterNoodle> thats the difference
[00:18:45] <ButterNoodle> I say ur still gonna smell like pig shit when ur done..
[00:18:54] <ButterNoodle> might as well have fucked the pig
[00:19:10] <MootPoot> yea, but people wont get behind that direct control
[00:19:13] <MootPoot> so you have to use fleshlight
[00:19:18] <MootPoot> so they can say they haven't fucked a pig
[00:19:19] <ButterNoodle> so.. deception is ok
[00:19:22] <MootPoot> yes
[00:19:28] <MootPoot> deception is okay

[00:21:30] <ButterNoodle> neither is gonna happen
[00:21:49] <MootPoot> then what would you suggest - NIMBYS are fucking up all plans for nuclear
[00:21:50] <MootPoot> so

[01:59:16] <Bco1981> Nanobot: my god... i hope that what you are experiencing with all the trouble with your take out orders. that. this isn't "standard" for takeout in america.
[01:59:24] <Bco1981> because, god damn!
[02:00:08] <Nanobot> At least here, online ordering like this basically didn't exist until the pandemic started.
[02:00:09] <Bco1981> the amount of shit you have had to put up with. i'm surprised you haven't caved in and just started cooking your self.
[02:00:16] <Bco1981> oh

[02:02:39] <MootPoot> order getting sent to a further place
[02:02:55] <MootPoot> afaik its up to the franchisee if they want to accept delivery
[02:03:02] <Nanobot> Pizza delivery has always existed, and then there was one local company that did delivery for like 8 different restaurants for several years (mostly Mexican places). Then, GrubHub started serving two or three restaurants here. Then, the pandemic happened, and suddenly DoorDash, GrubHub, etc. started serving dozens of restaurants here.
[02:03:03] <MootPoot> so not every sotre has it

I don't want her to give herself away, and I don't want the brunette to rat her out. The hero must discover something while having sex with her that somehow reveals that she's a full-grown human man in disguise, but I can't think of what that could be.

[10:03:52] <mexen> hi, everybody!
[10:04:18] <jessedesu_onaph> Hi
[10:07:11] <PancakeMatsuri> hi
[10:14:47] <ButterNoodle> lo
[10:14:50] <MootPoot> I'm confused
[10:14:53] <MootPoot> hi mexen 
[10:14:56] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[10:15:08] <MootPoot> just checked the UART line with oscillocope
[10:15:15] <MootPoot> its transmitting *soemthing* to the pico
[10:15:30] <MootPoot> the pico refuses to read it 
[10:15:31] <MootPoot> idk
[10:15:40] * MootPoot is confuzzled
[10:17:01] <ButterNoodle> reminds me of that time that the coders of gpsd decided to recode their shit to only read dtr even though the comments in the code said they would scan all lines for pps signals... and didnt
[10:17:21] <ButterNoodle> and then tried to #archlinux me into thinking I was the stupid one
[10:18:04] <MootPoot> maybe I'll go to the park and try the gps again
[10:18:19] <ButterNoodle> what r u doing?
[10:18:32] <ButterNoodle> what kinda code is reading the gps?
[10:19:22] <MootPoot> simple declare UART connection - read the output line and print directly to console
[10:19:40] <MootPoot> its not getting a lock based on the LED on the board
[10:19:48] <ButterNoodle> oh
[10:19:52] <ButterNoodle> code cant fix that
[10:19:55] <MootPoot> but the UART line keeps on going low every 1 second and sending something
[10:20:02] <ButterNoodle> yea
[10:20:05] <ButterNoodle> probably pps
[10:20:07] <MootPoot> so I was just wondering if its sending SOMETHING
[10:20:14] <MootPoot> why isen't it being printed out to me
[10:20:18] <MootPoot> in the console
[10:20:23] <ButterNoodle> its just a pulse
[10:20:34] <ButterNoodle> literally an on/off
[10:20:37] <MootPoot> oh
[10:20:48] <MootPoot> just a "hey this connection is live" thing?
[10:20:51] <MootPoot> handshake
[10:20:53] <MootPoot> etc
[10:20:53] <ButterNoodle> kinda
[10:21:07] <ButterNoodle> when the gps is locked it signifies the start of a second
[10:21:23] <ButterNoodle> otherwise its.. just a second
[10:21:31] <MootPoot> ah
[10:21:33] <ButterNoodle> based on how stable the gps clock is
[10:21:40] <MootPoot> so its just sending a clock signal
[10:21:42] <MootPoot> pretty much
[10:21:48] <ButterNoodle> exactly
[10:22:02] <ButterNoodle> should be sawtooth
[10:22:16] <ButterNoodle> idk how long it should be on
[10:22:32] <MootPoot> turns on every second for like 0.1 second
[10:22:32] <ButterNoodle> just went through these arguments with people that should know better than me.. but dont
[10:22:38] <ButterNoodle> yep
[10:22:46] <jessedesu_onaph> The only guns I can collect are spray guns
[10:22:50] <MootPoot> just guessing based on the readouts on my cheapo hantek

[21:54:35] <emmeka> Jigsy fwiw the laws of salvage *do* require you to offer to return it to the legitimate owner, but, you can demand compensation of equal value to do so.
[21:54:37] <Jigsy> It's like unsolicited goods.
[21:54:37] <ButterNoodle> we've proven to be as soft on crime as a 90 year old cock out of viagra
[21:54:49] <Jigsy> If you order a tablet and they send you two buy mistake, you don't get to keep the second one.
[21:55:08] <ButterNoodle> theft is pretty universal
[21:55:22] <emmeka> you don't keep to just keep legitimate salvages unconditionally, but they have to cough up the cash first to get their shit back
[21:55:26] <ButterNoodle> just may not be worthwhile to prosecute
[21:55:39] <Jigsy> ButterNoodle: The UK *loves* prosecuting people, though.
[21:55:50] <ButterNoodle> can u send people over to prosecute?
[21:56:03] <Jigsy> They actually tried prosecuting homeless people for stealing expired food from a bin once.
[21:56:13] <Jigsy> The only reason the case got dropped is because it really pissed off the public.

[22:27:32] <Cryowolf> emmeka, right now everyone pays the tax whether or not you own a tv, you can't escape it. In the past though, the moment you bought a tv, you had to start paying. The retailers were obligated by law to report your purchase directly to the agency. Many of them hated doing it and would try to delay it as long as possible or write in a friends or aqcuaintances adress
