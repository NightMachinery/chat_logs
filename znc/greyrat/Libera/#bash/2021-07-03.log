[02:03:21] <bewees> thanks, I didn't know that about SIGKILL. I will try to solve the core problem directly, which is check everytime bashrc is run, whether `emacs --daemon` is running and start emacs --daemon if it isn't
[02:04:11] <bewees> this is in wsl subsystem, where neither systemd nor init-system is available
[02:04:12] <greycat> maybe you should stop SIGKILLing things.
[02:04:49] <akoana> bewees: ^^ why do you need to kill -SIGKILL emacs --daemon when kill -SIGHUP works?
[02:04:56] <bewees> yes, i should close emacs just with c-k, not c-k-c
[02:05:05] <greycat> ... what.
[02:05:06] <rwp> bewees, Note in BashFAQ/045 the example uses "0" which is the old specification of the EXIT trap.
[02:06:25] <greycat> I'm not even sure which part of this to question first, because there are so many layers.  Let's start with... "Why do you believe that pressing some keys inside emacs is generating a -KILL signal?"
[02:06:31] <rwp> akoana, I note that in the paste the trap that was attempted to be set was for the script, not for emacs.
[02:07:14] <akoana> anyway, as greycat you can't trap SIGKILL
[02:07:20] <akoana> as greycat said*
[02:07:24] <rwp> bewees didn't say but in the XY problem I think they wanted to be able to log in multiple times but only start one emacs --daemon running.
[02:07:52] <bewees> greycat: ok it's closing gracefully, but I still can't use EXIT signal with trap, because that would have to be implemented inside /usr/bin/emacs
[02:07:54] <greycat> The second layer, which is following *very* closely on the heels of the first one, is "How in the hell are two keystroke sequences, one of which is a PREFIX of the other, are supposed to coexist?  Is there a timeout or something so it knows the shorter one is a complete command?"
[02:08:57] <greycat> I'd find an emacs channel and ask them how to launch this daemon only if there is not already one running.
[02:09:11] <greycat> Surely this is a well-known, fully solved problem.
[02:09:29] <bewees> I agree :-)
[02:09:52] <rwp> I am sure #emacs would be good but in passing I'll note that (setq confirm-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p) might prevent the accidental exit when not intended. :-)

[02:17:10] <earnestly> bewees: I like to use runit because busybox tends to come with it, so you can use: mkdir service/emacs printf '#!/bin/sh --\nemacs -daemon 2>&1\n' > service/emacs/run; chmod +x service/emacs/run; busybox runsv service/emacs
[02:17:15] <rwp> Personally I think running a whole supervisor stack is massive overkill.  However personally I simply run tmux/screen and run emacs in the first terminal.  And never exit that tmux/screen session.
[02:17:37] <earnestly> See above for a better solution
[02:17:39] <bewees>  akoana just tried that in wsl, I put that just in my bashrc, thanks!
[02:18:06] <earnestly> Also yeah, emacs do what akoana suggested
[02:18:34] <earnestly> rwp: Also you might also want to consider dtach instead of tmux if you want an even simpler session manager
[02:18:34] <rwp> Perfect!  Simplified solution.  No lock/semaphore handling needed.  No supervisor needed.  Simple is better than better.

[02:19:10] <earnestly> supervisors have added benefits though (and emacsclient is a bit flaky iirc)
[02:19:15] <rwp> earnestly, I used screen for years and years.  Eventually tried tmux.  Liked the feature set incrementally better.  Switched to it.  Have heard of dtach but no itch to scratch!
[02:19:34] <earnestly> rwp: dtach is just the detach/attach bits

[02:19:59] <earnestly> So no terminal emulation, multiplexing, etc.
[02:20:41] <rwp> I am really very happy with tmux though.  And tmux is pretty small configuration for me.
[02:21:15] <earnestly> Nothing particularly wrong with tmux

[14:01:18] <willow> for Debian I have tried PS1='\e]0;\W\a${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '    which almost works but is causing issues with the command line

[14:12:42] <pj> you have a mixture of hard-coded escapes and tput commands in there.
[14:13:05] <willow> ok i think i get it: for the colors specify them using 'local' and 'tput'
[14:14:09] <willow> yes interestingly the tput came from bashrcgenerator.com and the hard-coded were the default in Debian .bashrc
[14:15:10] <earnestly> Also calling tput every time the prompt is displayed :(
[14:15:15] <willow> here's the default in Debian user .bashrc if $color_prompt = yes:   PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
[14:15:44] <pj> yeah, except that local is only for inside functions and yeah, what earnestly said.  You're better off setting variables to the tput values and putting those in your prompt.

[14:18:19] <dale> I'm trying to use 'cmd | patch -o /dev/stdout --quiet "$file"' which will write the patched $file to stdout.  However, sometimes cmd produces no output (no diff), in which case patch also produces no output.  In that case, I really need $file written as-is (e.g. cat "$file").  Any suggestions other than dumping cmd's output to a temp file?

[16:53:02] <toretto> I've this Perl style regex which I need to apply for the output of `lsb_release -d` to get the name of the operationg system: "\:\s([a-zA-Z0-9.\s]+)$", how can I use this in a single line command to get the items within that group in a variable in bash?
[16:53:23] <toretto> I'm not sure how I can capture that into a variable.

[16:56:32] <toretto> Yeah, that's better.
[16:56:35] <toretto> thanks geirha 
[16:56:36] <geirha> even better would be   source /etc/os-release, then use "$VERSION" or "$PRETTY_NAME" or whichever fits best

[20:27:50] <apos> wow thank you i did not know spellcheck
[20:28:01] <twkm> [ command testing that the argument string length is greater than zero, true command, or what i use : command, are merely habit or style, yours is fine.  you should though be aware that [ 1 ] isn't checking for a non-zero value, merely a non-zero length -- it would be the same if you used [ 0 ] or [ a ].

[20:30:19] <apos> useful info
[20:31:39] <apos> i will try to improve the script as i use it everyday cause it runs 24/7 on my server
[20:31:42] <twkm> [ 1 ] is the same as [ -n 1 ].  if you wanted to check a value you'd have to include a comparison operator, like -eq or -ne or so, e.g., [ 1 -eq 1 ].

[20:37:11] <tengel> along the line of the value of record_paths, it looks like you're using mounted disks - it's a good failsafe to actually make _sure_ they're mounted before writing to them, as otherwise you'll be writing to the unmounted directory by accident if they're not

[21:09:39] <jetchisel> shellcheck NOT spellcheck ^^
[21:10:38] <apos> yes kinda... in any case if pid_write[i] becomes junk the proc/pid directory will not exist so it will start the command again. If the write_pid becomes another pid then both of my checks will fail it will pass as process is already running. but what are the chances it will get a pid value of another command hehe
[21:11:03] <apos> yesh shellcheck sorry
[21:11:10] <twkm> but the first time pid_write is empty.
[21:11:32] <apos> yes so -z reports its empty so it will proccess to run the command
[21:12:07] <twkm> the || catches it but there's no need to check if /proc/${pid_write[i]} aka /proc/ is a directory it must be for further checks to succeed.
[21:12:52] <apos> i just check if /proc/pid is running for this in the next loop
[21:13:01] <twkm> in fact you probably found you had to toss in the second check because the first was a false positive.
[21:13:13] <apos> yes ofc
[21:13:20] <apos> when pid is empty
[21:13:32] <apos> it checks for /proc/
[21:13:34] <twkm> so bothering to check when it is empty is a waste of time.
[21:13:49] <twkm> granted not a large waste.
[21:15:15] <apos> yes kinda a waste
[21:15:29] <apos> but i think its the simplest way
[21:15:37] <apos> since it is always need at the start
[21:16:48] <apos> i used to have a loop [0-n] that filled each pid with 00000 so it would always report false at the beginning

[23:18:33] <twkm> sounds like you need a samba channel.
[23:22:18] <emanuele6> there is a #samba channel with ~50 members, try there
[23:22:30] <apos> ty
[23:23:23] <kurahaupo> apos: Samba is trying to make the files visible to DOS clients that expect filenames to be in 8.3 format

[23:24:36] <apos> hmm interesting
[23:24:57] <kurahaupo> apos: I would guess that the colons in the filenames are the problem; DOS and Windows don't allow that
[23:25:43] <apos> yes maybe change it to '-' would help?
[23:26:01] <kurahaupo> You can also have fun putting \ * ? in filenames
[23:26:29] <apos> maybe ill stick to - for now and check it

[23:38:13] <tengel> there's no absolute rule for all things, but it's generally accepted practice to use the - for the Y-m-d element, however when naming files it's quite common to not use colons in it at all because of the known downsides

[23:38:25] <shbot> tengel: 2021-07-03 19:08:24+00:00
[23:39:01] <twkm> i'm surprised #samba didn't have any options.
[23:39:02] <tengel> most folks when naming files strip the colon and use it in a sortable fashion, like YYmmdd_HHMMSS.file
