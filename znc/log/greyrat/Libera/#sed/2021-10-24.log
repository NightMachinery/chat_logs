[16:57:12] <clarkk> I want to insert some spaces in front of any line which does NOT match the pattern (the matched lines always start with a timestamp like, 2021-10-24 13:34:51)
[16:57:41] <clarkk> I am running sed using the command  sed -E -f "$SCRIPTS_DIR/$FILTER_FILE"
[16:58:58] <clarkk> This is the sed filter/command    s/^(?![0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}).*/   \1/g
[16:59:29] <clarkk> This returns the error Invalid preceding regular expression.  Can anyone tell me what I've done wrong, please?
[17:01:11] <clarkk> If I remove ?!, it actually returns some results, but they are not correct
[17:02:07] <lopid> sed doesn't do lookarounds
[17:06:48] <lopid> sed -n '/pattern/{p;n};s/^/  /p'

[17:12:38] <clarkk> lopid, could you explain those commands?
[17:13:53] <lopid> -n means don't automatically print 
[17:14:31] <lopid> p means print; n means go to the next line
[17:15:28] <lopid> /when this pattern matches/{do these commands}

[17:16:14] <clarkk> very nice!!
[17:17:23] <clarkk> lopid, where can I read about these conditional commands?  What's it called, in sed speak?
[17:19:02] <lopid> a block? they're all in the man page
[17:24:42] <clarkk> Thanks for your help, lopid
