[21:35:32] <Arrinao> Is there a method that would work similarly to what .insert() does for columns but for rows?
[21:37:19] <papna> Arrinao: `append` should be used sparingly, as it can't opperate as efficiently as insert
[21:37:46] <Arrinao> I know, and it also doesn't do what I want it to do
[21:38:23] <Arrinao> basically I need to insert a row into the middle of the dataframe :/
[21:39:16] <papna> I would consider using the index to indicate the order, not the actual order.
[21:39:18] <papna> You can slice the top of your dataframe and bottom, and use `concat` to put your middle stuff in the middle
[21:39:42] <Arrinao> phew
[21:39:47] <Arrinao> so it's really the only way?
[21:40:14] <papna> I don't think there's a convenience function for it, since it's somewhat of an antipattern
[21:40:16] <Arrinao> I've read about this and I found that really complicated in comparison with .insert()
[21:40:58] <Arrinao> come on now... inserting a damn row is antipattern?
[21:41:10] <papna> Adding and removing and reordering columns is cheap and encouraged. Rows less so.
[21:41:19] <Arrinao> how come?
[21:41:43] <papna> Conceptually, a dataframe is a column store. It's a collection of Series.
[21:42:05] <papna> A column of a dataframe is backed by contiguous(ish) memory, and can require copies to add/remove from
[21:42:23] <papna> So entries in a column are typically held fairly static
[21:42:37] <Arrinao> I see :/
[21:43:52] <Arrinao> I guess I'm just spoiled by Excel that I find inserting a row such a trivial action to do
[21:46:13] <Arrinao> papna just to summarize: so when I find myself in a situation that requires inserting a row, I'm better off exporting the pandas to some other format, do it there and import it back?
[21:47:35] <papna> You're welcome to do pd.concat([df.iloc[:n], row, df.iloc[n:]) -- it's a little clunky, but not the end of the world
[21:47:54] *** Quits: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:48:09] <papna> The more idiomatic thing might be to stop caring about the order of the dataframe, paying attention instead to the index.
[21:49:33] <Arrinao> how would you do that?
[21:50:06] <Arrinao> via sorting or something like that?
[23:31:29] <Arrinao> papna btw. I tried your code and it doesn't seeom to work :/
[23:32:12] <Arrinao> (I've fixed the missing bracket) but following error returned: TypeError: first argument must be an iterable of pandas objects, you passed an object of type "DataFrame"
[23:56:00] <papna> Arrinao: Can you post an SSCCE? http://sscce.org/

[23:58:47] <Arrinao> papna https://dpaste.com/8R36N7T9J
[23:59:35] <Arrinao> there should be [:1] and [1:] in ilocs
[23:59:58] <Arrinao> but it does not really matter doe sit
