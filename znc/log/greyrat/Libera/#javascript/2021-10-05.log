[02:00:24] <slaughter> Trying to understand some currying I just came across. Have a function used as a filter callback that is curried - `func = passedValue => (iteratorValue) => ...` - but when called it's just `filter(func(passedValue))` - is this because the `thisArg` (MDN terminology) in a filter function is implicitly passed to the callback?
[02:01:03] <slaughter> Probably described that horribly
[02:02:06] <systemfault> It's unrelated to thisArg, it's just that func(passedValue) returns a predicate
[02:03:12] <systemfault> n> const gt = val => x => x > val; [1,2,3,4,5].filter(gt(2))

[02:05:06] <systemfault> Make things hard to read.
[02:05:09] <slaughter> Yeah that's the source of all the confusion
[02:05:34] <systemfault> That said, I like libraries that uses data-last currying so you can use pipe on them

[02:05:56] <jellobot> (okay) [Function (anonymous)]
[02:06:09] <slaughter> Ok so in this case, `thisArg` is definitely used by the callback function (iteratorValue there) - but isn't passed to the filter at all. It's just `filter(func(passedValue))` - how in the hell would that work
[02:06:59] <slaughter> I guess it could be _not_ `thisArg` but it's not pulling that iteratorValue out of thin air
[02:07:06] <systemfault> Must be their own implementation of filter, I don't know

[02:43:44] <ThePendulum> oh you were serious, I thought you meant "that would take me an hour so good luck". yes, the main operation is .replace and I didn't really have much to go on, and I figured string.replace(/(foo)|(bar)x1000/g, () => {}) might be faster than [/foo/, /bar/].forEach((expression) => string.replace(expression, 'something'));
[02:44:59] <ThePendulum> because it would still have to run the same regex, but with the overhead of calling .replace from scratch. maybe there are some nuances, I never really had enough incentive to rebuild this entire system with the alternative approach and compare them

[02:48:44] <ThePendulum> not exactly a part of the system I'm particularly proud of, but I didn't have any better ideas and it did the job. happy to take a different approach if there's reason to believe it'll be worth it
[02:50:09] <ljharb> ThePendulum: "faster" won't likely matter on things at this small a scale
[02:51:16] <ThePendulum> we're dealing with up to a couple thousand expressions on old hardware, given the { ...acc } issue from a while back I'm a bit wary, lol
[02:51:42] <ThePendulum> but yeah if that's the main reason I should run some tests to see if it's even faster in the first place
[02:52:38] <ThePendulum> because practically it's a PITA, if I can iterate through the regexes individually then when there's a match, I have all the replace data available and I don't need to try and find the regex it actually found in the original list

[08:03:15] <chovy> ljharb: why you don't like deno?
[08:03:28] <ljharb> chovy: because it drops all the things that are the reason node succeeded, and adds all the reasons browsers suck
[08:03:36] <ljharb> fetching modules over the network is just terrible
[08:03:54] <chovy> ljharb: it cashes them when you compile
[08:04:08] <ljharb> basically, node is great and web browsers are terrible and deno takes the worst parts of the latter and drops the best parts of the former

[08:05:44] <chovy> you just don''t need 80000000 of them

[08:05:59] <chovy> ljharb: you can insall a specific version
[08:06:02] <ljharb> but it's a feature of node that you CAN have that many - that things are abstracted and encapsulated that well

[08:06:33] <ljharb> build time is irrelevant, maintenance time is what matters

[08:50:48] <ross> any rollup/vite users here? I'm trying to make a cjs bundle from esm source, but my export is ignored - `export const blah = foo()` in the esm source becomes `foo()` in the cjs bundle, instead of `module.exports = { blah: foo() }` or even `exports.blah = foo()` as I expect - this means the next step in my build can't `require()` it, because it's not exported. any idea what could be causing this?
[08:51:57] <ljharb> ross: you can't usually make CJS from ESM
[08:52:04] <ljharb> ross: why unless it's using babel

[08:57:42] <ljharb> esbuild is not a good path to go down
[08:57:53] <ljharb> ross: is vite's rollup using babel?
[08:59:04] <ross> ljharb: yeah I've had not-so-great experiences with esbuild esp. with snowpack, but I can't deny that it's fast. re babel, truth be told I'm not totally sure, but I've got the target set to es2019 and I'm writing es2020 syntax so I assume so

[08:59:47] <ross> lmao yep
[09:00:02] <ljharb> ross: i think babel by default assumes you're inputting ESM and outputting CJS, so that seems like it should be fine
[09:00:18] <ljharb> ross: are you importing it anywhere? rollup stupidly tries to be clever with its treeshaking sometimes
[09:00:24] <ross> it *is* outputting cjs, just not with an export
[09:00:32] <ljharb> lol well sure
[09:00:39] <ljharb> i know babel gets this right, or literally everything would be broken
[09:00:48] <ross> importing it in the next stage of the build script, sure, but rollup wouldn't know about it
[09:01:10] <ljharb> so that's probably it - you have to tell rollup "no really, don't delete this code because that's not your fucking job"
[09:01:19] <ljharb> marking the export as used externally, or something
[09:01:19] <ross> I think you might be onto something there
[09:01:29] <ross> normally "export" works for that lmao
[09:01:36] <ljharb> i don't use rollup (because it's broken and terrible) so i don't know what the config would be
[09:01:38] <ljharb> ross: lol yes, precisely
[09:02:05] <ross> honestly, my least favourite thing about rollup so far is that they lumped all their docs into a single page
[09:02:24] <ross> web searches for "rollup <feature>" may as well just be searches for rollup
[09:02:42] <ljharb> i'd take their docs in the form of a rickroll video if the tool only followed the language spec

[09:39:00] <Intelo> ljharb : its a typescript constructor which does not requries additional fields to be typed by developer.
[09:39:01] <Intelo>         ross : no foo(a.1, a.2, a.3) is same as foo({1,2,3}). Let me know if I am wrong. The purpose of max-paren is to limit the args and use an object instead. Like myObj = {1,2,3}; foo(myObj);

[10:02:50] <ljharb> Intelo: there are no such situations
[10:02:58] <ljharb> Intelo: you should redesign so you don't need 10 params.

[10:04:11] <theskillwithin> even your example only has 3
[10:04:37] <Intelo> no matter how much you tell them, ljharb they will write more than 100s of lines per function, 5-7 params

[10:05:00] <ljharb> Intelo: then fire them and hire non-incompetent people
[10:05:07] <ljharb> Intelo: you can't fix bad programmers with a linter
[10:05:26] <Intelo> the only way I thought to indirectly make them think was to enforce lint rules. So they would think on "how can i divide my function into smaller reusable parts"

[19:31:46] <dayday> Damn
[19:31:54] <hmw[at]> You will need to put your var declarations into the main scope. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope
[19:32:27] <silly_> you can assign yo to a variable outside and then access in otherThingie, but for var hey, to do the same, you'd actually have to run otherThingie before alert(hey) in line5

[19:36:19] <banana_> you push up shared variables to the common block around the internal function blocks

[19:40:04] <znf> I'm planning to do some sort of auth/key validation on Cloudflare's Workers and I'm not sure what path should I follow. Ideally I'd craft the URL with some sort of hash that is signed by my app and is checked by the worker running on cloudflare; I don't need specifically tight "security" and reliability, I literally need to expire the URL somehow after a set amount of time
[19:41:15] <znf> so on the server side on my app, I'd craft a url like https://domain/file.bin?expire_at=payload, where payload would be generate server side and signed with a key known by me (my app) and the cloudflare worker (hardcoded is fine)

[21:02:35] <efdee> imo the battle was over before chrome came to be
[21:02:42] <deadk> the same problem exists now tbh
[21:02:44] <efdee> and then chrome came and urinated in everyone's coffee
[21:02:54] <efdee> chrome was nice and refreshing when it first came out tho
[21:03:01] <znf> what's your argument for that? :)
[21:03:05] <znf> genuinely curious
[21:03:13] <deadk> it's just that the IE of now is chrome, the tiny number of firefox users that remain have to be prepared for random sites to break
[21:03:14] <efdee> for what
[21:03:19] <znf> "battle was over"
[21:03:24] <znf> because I don't see how it was

[21:03:32] <austincheney> chromium is chrome with much less stuff, i run on some of my linux VMs
[21:03:39] <znf> IE was still king
[21:03:46] <znf> Firefox had... what? 35% at it's peak?
[21:03:59] <efdee> IE post IE6 had to take standards into account
[21:04:08] <codebam> if you use the chromium flatpak it's basically just chrome. it has all the codecs at least
[21:04:12] <deadk> austincheney: right, you can get white-labelled chrome under various different brands, but it's basically the same thing
[21:04:30] <ljharb> codebam: the problem is the browser engine dominating, it doesn't matter if you use google's chrome or chromium
[21:04:33] <znf> I don't recall IE7 & Co ever having more marketshare than IE6
[21:04:45] <znf> (not during those periods anyway)
[21:04:51] <efdee> znf: i'm not talking about market share. you're right there. but as a firefox user, there definitely was a "before" and "after" time.
[21:05:30] <efdee> znf: using firefox in the IE7/8 era was definitely a possibility. in the IE6 era, not so much - imo
[21:05:30] <znf> If you did webdev back then, the war wasn't even started IMO, you still had to code for IE6, no matter what
[21:05:40] <codebam> oh yeah agreed. firefox's gecko engine and apple webkit are the only competing engines right now
[21:05:53] <znf> Apple can fuck right off tough

[21:06:05] <efdee> znf: sure, but having to cater for IE6 carried on long after that. not much firefox or anyone could do about that. not even chrome.
[21:06:05] <znf> Safari is the new IE6 for me
[21:06:17] <efdee> pretty much
[21:06:34] <znf> I've experimented with some nifty SVG things a while back
[21:06:41] <codebam> at least chrome is good
[21:06:48] <codebam> IE used to be really slow
[21:06:49] <znf> Stuff was working great everywhere, even Edge (before Chromium), but not in Safari
[21:07:13] <ljharb> old android is the new IE. safari's fine.
[21:07:15] <znf> granted: Edge didn't want to use my @font, but everything else worked, even the media query inside the svg
[21:07:31] <znf> Safari just refused to take my media query into consideration
[21:08:00] <austincheney> aside from missing features due to age I never had any serious cross browser problems with IE11
[21:08:03] <znf> heck, I even had trouble between iMac and MacBook, same browser, same OS, just a different screen size basically
[21:08:23] <austincheney> most of the problems I saw with IE were completely self-inflicted and jQuery introduced many of them
[21:08:25] <znf> on the big iMac screen, it worked, on the small MacBook... it didn't
[21:10:20] <efdee> ljharb: does anyone really care about old android?
[21:10:48] <gamara> *tumble weed*
[21:10:54] <efdee> ljharb: i've had safari display the most horrible rendering bugs on modern apple gear
[21:11:11] <ljharb> efdee: sites with users on it do, and that'most
[21:11:13] <ljharb> *that's most
[21:11:19] <ljharb> efdee: what rendering bugs?
[21:11:23] <efdee> yea no.
[21:11:31] <ljharb> i dunno, check your analytics
[21:11:37] <efdee> i do. hence.
[21:11:40] <ljharb> a LOT of people have shitty cheap old android phones
[21:11:44] <efdee> ljharb: as far as refusing to render entire divs, wrt safari bugs
[21:11:55] <ljharb> old android was a huge % of cases in airbnb's analytics a few years ago
[21:12:03] <ljharb> efdee: would love to see a repro case
[21:12:11] <ljharb> efdee: not that i don't believe you, just out of curiosity
[21:12:24] <efdee> ljharb: next time i run into one of them, i'll show you
[21:12:26] <ljharb> but bugs also isn't what "the new IE" means
[21:12:29] <ljharb> efdee: thanks
[21:12:38] <efdee> ljharb: the kind of bugs where if you look at them in the inspector, they suddenly get rendered ok
[21:13:01] <efdee> ljharb: like missing certain repaint cues or whatever
[21:13:38] <znf> but why would it matter?
[21:13:49] <znf> even on old Android phones, the browser is ever-green
[21:14:00] <znf> unless you're rendering shit in WebView, which... why?
[21:14:02] <efdee> is it though?
[21:14:10] <efdee> can browsers still upgrade on old android?
[21:14:14] <efdee> because android itself sure can't
[21:14:30] <znf> they barely killed Maps & YouTube on 2.3.x phones this month
[21:14:33] <bomb> Firefox is my daily driver, but I only test my stuff on Chrome & Safari
[21:15:03] <znf> So I assume yes, they can still upgrade the browser?

[22:42:59] <sheetjs> some projects do the "enterprise in the open source repo" thing and benefit from the free-for-public-repo resources
[22:43:45] <sheetjs> qswz: so you might find it easier to just make the stuff public and put a BSL or SSPL or other license on it
[22:43:46] <qswz> that's quite a step tho

[22:45:11] <sheetjs> is there a reason not to do it?
[22:45:24] <qswz> what we could do, is run our tests in prod on startup, all free
[22:45:41] <qswz> if it crashes, then it'd tell us or something
[22:45:44] <pavonia> wedr: Do you really need setting the inline style? Sometimes this can be fixed by adding a new class to the CSS files and setting this form jQuery
[22:45:56] <qswz> sheetjs: most companies just don't want to share their code
[22:46:07] <wedr> pavonia, I need the jQuery file, because the Bootstrap 3.3.7 requires JQuery 3.4.1
[22:46:14] <wedr> It has nothing to do with our code. :(
[22:46:54] <sheetjs> that is understood, but if there are free CI solutions for public repos but not private repos then there's a concrete benefit to making certain things public
[22:46:54] <qswz> wedr: show the server response header
[22:47:00] <silly_> if you don't want to share, you better don't upload it. use git locally and script the rest yourself

[23:42:54] <noircode> which is appropriate for tetris with <canvas>: setInterval(), setTimeout(), or request animationFrame(callback)?
