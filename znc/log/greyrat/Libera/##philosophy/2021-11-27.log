[10:57:59] <Jong> Why do so many people value formal / institutional education when anyone who wants can read books without going to school to do it?  I see academics constantly trying to increase graduation rates. And I see people who judge based on what degree someone has. They'll, for example, see a CS degree and think the person's knowledge is therefore confined to CS.  I understand some fields require expensive equipment that would make attending a
[10:58:00] <Jong>  university a practical good idea. But I'm talking about fields in which everything you need to learn you already have access to it.  Math, CS, law, philosophy, history, and language-related fields I think can be learned on one's own. Am I wrong?
[10:59:52] <I_Am_M00t> because you dont get a degree by just reading books
[11:01:04] <I_Am_M00t> learning under actual teachers is far more effective than just reading books at home
[11:01:47] <Jong> but you still learn the content. If you learn calculus II, you learned it. Whether you learned it for a grade, or for money, for mere curiosity, or for shits and giggles doesn't change the fact that you learned it. Motive for an act is an independent thing from the act itself
[11:02:09] <I_Am_M00t> if you don't go to uni, you won't pick up  books
[11:02:20] <Jong> well, I have.
[11:02:29] <I_Am_M00t> mmhm
[11:02:35] <Jong> I didn't major in philosophy, but I have over 20 books in philosophy
[11:02:41] <I_Am_M00t> mmmhmm
[11:03:47] <Jong> I bought many intro to philosophy books. I bought many because I was concerned what one would leave out that another would have.  It was interesting to see what the major overlapping topics were, what topics were found in some books but not in others, among other observations when comparing and contrasting books on the same subject.
[11:04:40] <Jong> I also bought books that went deeper into detail in specific subtopics of philosophy, like philosophy of language. I've also read the writings of actual philosophers themselves, like Kant. In the case of Kant, it was a translation of his work I read.
[11:05:21] <Jong> John Locke has a huge volume of work I've read some of.
[11:06:22] <I_Am_M00t> I'd take university education over fiddling around with material at home any day of the week
[11:09:12] <Jong> I_Am_M00t communication is valuabe--if not invaluable--in all aspects of life. Studying philosophy on my own helped me learn to navigate and communicate ideas and concepts more clearly.  A lay person will often miss gaps in their logic, or where they may be conflating ideas, or where they're talking about two things at the same time instead of splitting and placing into linear sequence ideas when presenting them. At least, that's what I
[11:09:12] <Jong>  realized about myself, and I've improved in those areas as I studied philosophy.
[11:09:26] <Jong> I_Am_M00t  university lectures are available for free on youtube.

[11:12:09] <Jong> Think about it. If Calc II at Stanford for spring 2019, summer 2019, fall 2019, etc is available online, and same for MIT, and Harvard, then after 3 years you have probably over 20 variations of the same lectures available. If one variation glosses over something you've not understood, you're bound to find it in the other lecture videos.
[11:13:39] <I_Am_M00t> why go to school when you can be homeschooled
[11:13:52] <I_Am_M00t> a university degree is evidence of a skill

[11:14:46] <I_Am_M00t> you sitting at home reading books, without any external feedback or testing, good luck
[11:15:02] <Jong> I_Am_M00t I code software.  My confidence in learning on my own comes from the fact that in the world of coding, one can prove to oneself whether they really learned something about using what they learned. For example, if someone really learned how to create an AI that can translate sentences from one language to another, the person can prove it by making the software.  The ability to prove to oneself that something was really learned means
[11:15:02] <Jong>  that school isn't needed to prove that you learned it.  I guess that's why inventors don't really need school. Their invention proves that they know their stuff.
[11:15:16] <I_Am_M00t> good luck
[11:15:29] <I_Am_M00t> I'll take that university degree any day of the week
[11:17:13] <Jong> But what does that mean when you say you'll take your university degree any day? The courses you sat in on, what difference does it make if you instead watched them online?  The only difference I can see is that you have access to a professor's office hours. But if you don't take advantage of the office hours, isn't it the same as if it you watched the lectures online and did the course assignments yourself on your own?

[11:32:10] <I_Am_M00t> I'd be curious to see some empirical studies on that
[11:35:36] <bittersweetsymph> I would say it is much better to learn at uni/face to face but don't knock people who do it by distance education or are self taught as they are doing it in the trenches and may learn more independently learning without the support you might get in a face to face situation.
[11:36:22] <Jong> I'm trying to imagine a situation in which someone mistakenly thinks they learned something correctly and continues reading multiple renditions of the same subject and after reading, say, 5 renditions hasn't realized that they were mistaken in key parts of the subjects. Hmm. Take epistemology, the concept of the tabula rasa-- blank slate. Or sensory perception. Or the tripartite theory of knowledge expounded by Bertrand Russell. Or
[11:36:22] <Jong>  Wittgenstein's work.  There's no way that someone can learn this incorrectly and realize it over time with constant exposure to the subject. Just keep learning and reading every day.  It's all about compounded exposure.   I think consistent long term exposure is king.

In the case of inventors and coders, it's easy to cherry pick those who learned on their own.   Evidence of whether it's better for across the board?  The issue there is that most people lack a genuine passion in what they want to do in life.  They're in university as an extended adolescence. They get a degree and later a job because they
[12:06:08] <Jong>  want money for a decent life.  The interest and drive isn't very high.  They spend their spare time socializing and hanging out. You see it all over instagram.

[12:12:27] <Jong> Wouldn't you be bound to run into a text that is inconsistent with your belief if your belief is incorrect?  Texts in academic fields are systems of knowledge where each piece depends on another, often in such a way that breaking into the system to explain it is a challenge itself. With such interconnectedness, it's a matter of time that misunderstandings are identified and corrected.

[12:20:47] <Jong> Kant was one of the supreme system-builders of modern philosophy, and he was very good at making an immense range of views fit together in a comprehensive and systematic way.

[13:11:38] <arryana> a friend of mine owns a company, and he used to try to hire those who 'learned independently' as opposed to hiring people with degrees.
[13:12:22] <arryana> he discovered along the line that too many of the people without university experience simply didn't know how to get along, or do bits of the job they didn't like/understand the point of.
[13:12:34] <arryana> they wanted too often to be in charge, instead of doing their jobs.
[13:13:05] <arryana> so i suppose it could be argued that the education itself is not the only thing one learns at a university, but how to get along in a workplace environment

[13:32:33] <Jong> arryana I typed "I rest my case" just as an expression. The opinion-fact topic I'm aware of and have read a lot about. It has significance in law too.    I'm just now reading something that resonates with me that no teacher said before. "Two Approaches to Philosophy. Introductory courses in philosophy typically employ either an historical or a systematic approach. In the former, one studies, in chronological sequence, the thought and writings
[13:32:33] <Jong>  of selected philosophers from ancient times to the present. A principal objective in such study is to acquire historical information--to find out what Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, and others thought about whatever topics they happened to have dealt with. The truth that one is seeking in such a study is historical truth, that is, an accurate account of the thought of this or that philosopher or group of philosophers. The methodology
[13:32:33] <Jong>  appropriate to such an approach is the methodology appropriate to any historical study: authentication of the primary sources, careful interpretation of selected texts, and the like.      The Approach to philosophy employed in this book, however, is not historical but systematic. The understanding that we are seeking is an understanding of a series of philosophical problems, and the possible solutions to these problems. The truth that we are
[13:32:33] <Jong>  seeking is the truth with respect to each of these problems, and the relation of this truth to that adequate world view and philosophy of life that are the ultimate aims of the philosophical quest.  If in the course of our study we learn something about what this or that philosopher had to say, all well and good: then our historical knowledge will have been incidentally enriched in the process of our systematic study."   <-- This explains
[13:32:33] <Jong>  why the course I took on philosophy long ago resembles more like a history class of what each philosopher said, and I didn't get any unified grasp of philosophy until I studied on my own.  I think this resentment upsets me and that's why I'm pro-learn-on-my-own.

[13:45:31] <Atque> arryana: An excellent student does well because the marker says so, but I agree. Finding interest drives a lot of learning. It can't all be stuffed down our throats.
[13:45:43] <Maxdamantus> Plenty of physicists nowadays will obviously be far ahead of Einstein in knowledge, but being able to come up with general relativity is much more impressive than knowing it.
[13:45:48] <Jong> arryana wouldn't you be a little upset if you found a book that illuminated a subject significantly better than the teacher did?  Part of my learn on my own > taking courses is due to the fact that many courses I studied to the test but didn't really learn much it was until years later when I found great books that I relearned it. It's like watching a bad black and white movie rendition of a book and then years later watching remake but with
[13:45:48] <Jong>  full color with the best actors and an even better story line more true to the book. Or like reading the book and seeing how much the movie was inferior in comparison

[13:49:01] <Atque> Maxdamantus: Discoveries are notable; a 100 years later, people remember Einstein. Learning relativity is hard. In many ways, physics courses recreate the intellectual development journeys of Einstein, Rutherford etc. Einstein never came up with the next steps either, so it is hard to see how his journey is somehow better than a good student in the contemporary academy.

[14:13:11] <Jong> Regarding the point of being able to ask questions in classes and that you can't do that for books, my response is this: the best books are written so well that you have no questions after you're done reading it.    Writing this well is in fact possible. Lawyers must do it. Not all cases have oral argument, and lawyers must hone their skill of anticipating the questions the judge(s) will have and make sure they're answered in the written
[14:13:12] <Jong>  arguments.  The judge(s) do not mail the lawyers a set of questions of what's still puzzling the judges after reading the lawyers' written argument.

[14:34:19] <Jong> My point is that a plaintiff can go through an entire lawsuit without oral argument. The federal trial courts are not required by law in USA to have oral argument.  Plaintiff and defendant can file motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment.  They file responses to one another.  The trial judge reads them. The trial judge can render a ruling without stating a legal analysis. The losing party can appeal, needing to remake the entire
[14:34:19] <Jong>  case to the appellate court as the losing party doesn't know why the judge ruled against them.  The appellate court can deny oral argument and can choose to rule just on the written arguments (called "briefs").  So my point stands, lawyers must hone their skill of anticipating and answering all the questions that judges will have without the judges needing to ask.

[14:45:21] <shea> Jong: Whether or not what you say about oral argument is right, I think it's wrong to say that lawyers draft in such a way that there are no questions left in a judge's mind. Courts often leave several questions that arise in a case unanswered if it is not necessary to answer to dispose of a case. In Austraila, this often happens with regards to Constitutional issues, where it is a principle
[14:45:23] <bittersweetsymph> In the rittenhouse case I think if the prosecution tried to argue he used excessive force then maybe that would have got the jury to agree.
[14:45:24] <shea> of law not to answer such questions unless they necessarily arise
[14:45:50] <bittersweetsymph> But maybe not either
[14:46:03] <Atque> Jong: It is not some trick. It says the appellate must allow oral arguments unless a panel of three judges unanimously agree one of those three conditions are met.

The point being is that lawyers do not draft to be so comprehensive that no question arises, which you said was a skill that they possess in support of the contention that the best books are those which there are no questions remaining upon their completion. Lawyers' drafting is a reflection of practical necessities, not academic comprehensiveness. In truth, lawyers' writing is

[15:01:50] <Atque> shea: Haha, well, it is not a good evening read. A good lawyer needs to be clear and economic. There's no benefit in a brief being pedantically comprehensive.
[15:02:24] <Jong> Atque  okay so oral argument can be denied even if it aids the decision but not "significantly". (2)(c) is being stretched beyond what it should be due to case loads. It's the reality of the situation. Look at a federal court of appeals docket and you'll see many case dockets show oral argument denied. My uncle is a lawyer and was talking about this awhile ago.

[15:04:32] <shea> And, as an expense of being 'clear and economic', there is often questions that linger which needn't be answered. That doesn't mean those questions do not exist. It just means that lawyers are not evidence to suggest that one can create a piece of writing that leaves every question that one may fairly ask answered
[15:04:56] <Atque> Jong: Litigation never originates as an appeal. You appeal decisions from lower courts. I'm not sure what the point is you are trying to make.
[15:05:03] *** Joins: betelgeuse9 (~betelgeus@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[15:05:42] <shea> This is in response to what Jong said: "... the best books are written so well that you have no questions after you're done reading it. WRiting this well is ... possible. Lawyers must do it."
[15:05:48] <Atque> Jong: What's more is your original point is very naive. Research, policy and fiction are almost always inconclusive. The best writers don't exhaust questions.
[15:06:10] <Jong> Please let me clarify shea. I didn't mean every question possible. I meant every question that bears on a material element of the case, one that is necessary to be answered in deciding the matter before the court.
[15:06:47] <shea> Jong: That may be true, but how is that evidence that "... the best books are written so well that you have no questions after you're done reading it"
[15:06:55] <Atque> Jong: Check any philosophy of science, for example. There's no final truth in chemistry, physics etc. There's just steps forward from the moment before.

[15:08:14] <shea> There are often questions left unanswered at the conclusion of a case which is not material to the case itself, but are of an intellectual interest nevertheless such that, if you were a person learning from such writing you may fairly want that question answered.
[15:09:00] <Atque> Not even religious texts attempt exhausting questions. Every Jew, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist etc. would say there's mysteries. Fiction and film don't either; it keeps it interesting. Really too, as human being, we can't really be exhaustive.

[15:14:55] <shea> So, if we get back to the primary point of discussion, which I take it was about self-learning versus attending university and how one of the advantages of attending university was the ability to have questions answered when they arise, how does legal writing support the contention that books can be written such that there are no questions remaining that a person may fairly ask, given the
[15:14:58] <shea> concession that legal writing often leaves matters of pure intellectual interest unanswered where it is not practically necessary to answer them?

[15:24:33] <Jong> shea  questions that technically aren't material but that still the judge would want to know about, hopefully the lawyer can foresee if oral argument is denied.   Regarding to how this relates to books, it shows the federal judges' overall belief that it's possible to explain oneself satisfactorily the first time through if one is good enough.

[15:32:51] <Atque> Jong: Your point there also has gaps. Universities facilitate validating people acquired a knowledge base successfully. There are exams, tests, assignments and so forward. You may also be able to do that through doing a certification or similar, but just reading content doesn't validate acquiring knowledge.
[15:32:58] <shea> I think it can be fairly conceeded that a disadvantage of self-teaching is the more limited opportunity to ask questions and discuss with peers and professors the topics that arebeing learned. That does not necessarily mean that the contemporary university is better than self-teaching, it is merely weight in the scales

[16:54:35] <Ungwelian> My experience of uni was that it meant reading books and writing essays to the lecturers.
[16:55:04] <Ungwelian> Many of the lecturers taught from old powerpoints. Some of them had stuff that wasn't in the books, some not.
[16:55:19] <Ungwelian> Books had plenty of stuff that wasn't in the lectures.

[16:57:37] <shea> Im my experience, lectures and tutorials acted as ancilliary to the readings in the text book
[16:57:53] <Ungwelian> Exams were less work, but meant too little time to read the books properly, and also just regurgitating stuff in the books.

[16:59:45] <bittersweetsymph> I think there is a lot of just writing what they want you to say and learning what they say to learn to get the degree whether or not the person disagrees with what was written it knows it will never be of the least use to them in their lives or it is a repeat of something they already learnt before.
[16:59:46] <Ungwelian> Often I felt annoyed that uni actually took time from reading the books.
[16:59:46] <shea> I think that's a pretty fair assessment of many people's experience at university, particularly in the last decade or so
[17:00:06] <shea> Ungwelian: Ditto that last point
[17:00:28] <Ungwelian> bittersweetsymph, yeah.
