[01:48:58] <seebs> I think after further study, the basic concept is more generally a way to combine operations fluently that's slightly agnostic about the shape of the specific operations, so things like "lists" or "maybe-foo" or whatever, but let you reuse the traversal code without having to rewrite it to add features like "but with a way to break out early" or "but asynchronously"
[01:49:12] <seebs> and that's... sort of neat i guess? but feels a little like the nand gates thing.

[09:43:25] <Solid> (not to mention that lots of languages have syntax for _special_ monads, like rust with ? and the async-await stuff, but don't have a type system strong enough to talk about the general thing (which would've even made some hot debates about syntax superfluous!))
[09:47:17] <seebs> so, my thought is sort of... given that you can do things like Maybe or Async or whatever pretty easily with a weak type system, I haven't often seen a case where there was a thing that was more than a couple of lines of code that was getting duplicated more than a couple of times, but would be only written once generically given a type system allowing fully generic monads.

[09:48:27] <seebs> but that may just be because i'm not writing Haskell, and over about an hour of searching the other day, I did not actually find a single example of monad stuff that wasn't in Haskell except for a couple of "this is roughly how you'd implement these SPECIFIC monads in other languages" type things.
[09:49:02] <seebs> it seems to me that in principle, dynamically-typed languages should be able to do the generic form, i guess, but most strongly-typed languages don't have flexible enough type systems to admit this.
[09:50:13] <Solid> exactly, most languages simply don't have HKTs
[09:52:54] <Solid> (and I can definitely say that the number of times I've used a function that's polymorphic over the chosen monad in different contexts is quite high---I wouldn't have wanted to write all of that by hand!)
[09:54:03] <seebs> Interesting! This could be one of those things like... in C, I tend not to sling functions around a lot, because it's more of a pain, in Go I will throw anonymous closures at anything because it's idiomatic and free.
[09:54:20] <seebs> But in C, I usually don't feel like I'm "missing" functions, I just don't think of functions-in-C as working that way.
[09:54:55] <seebs> I usually find that I get the best results from each language by embracing its worldview while using it.
[09:55:01] <Solid> oh, that's a pretty good analogy

[09:58:29] <seebs> so, like, someone gave me as an example of a thing you could do, swapping between "list of (either string or int)" and "either string or (list of int)". and that seems sort of meaningless to me, but if i think of it as "list of (either bool or int)", and turn that to "either bool or (list of int)", well, that's sort of flavored like any?/all?/some?
[09:59:01] <seebs> (although either isn't actually-a-monad, but whatever, details.)

[10:25:40] <seebs> so it turns out that "kind" in haskell is a Term Of Art that is unrelated to things like "x is a kind-of-a y", but is rather "the type of a type", and knowing that makes a ton of these explanations make more sense.

[20:12:28] <seebs> actually on further study i'm pretty comfortable with the conclusion that the no-monads post is not a very good argument, and mostly consists of "well people aren't using them in a language which doesn't have them, they must not be that great".
[20:13:07] <seebs> that said, i think they're probably more appealing in haskell than other languages specifically because the type system provides the hooks necessary to have the "and they just go together automatically" *enforced*.
[20:13:28] <seebs> without that, you can indeed write the code that just glues things together, but if you get it wrong it can be pretty hard to debug
