[16:38:03] <jholtom> It's not very good and has some major issues due to the way Julia's interpreter gets set up
[16:38:46] <jholtom> But there are ways around it with work, esp in gr4.0 I'm thinking it will get easie
[16:53:57] <DerekKozel[m]> I was looking at the zero-copy numpy->Julia Array mappings and at the C++ -> Julia pointer bits
[16:55:06] <DerekKozel[m]> Triggered by seeing https://github.com/JuliaTelecom
[16:55:27] <DerekKozel[m]> and also https://github.com/orgs/JuliaComputing/repositories has forked and is issuing PRs from a variety of SDR repos including UHD, LiteX, and Soapy
[16:55:45] <DerekKozel[m]> and https://github.com/JuliaDSP
[17:12:09] <jholtom> DerekKozel[m]: I'm 99% sure what I'm doing isn't zero-copt
[17:12:31] <jholtom> Unless the underlying python library is and I don't know
[17:13:31] <jholtom> The C++ I know isn't though, it copies a new Julia object onto the heap

[18:33:09] <mspears-VE3AGS[m> good morning everyone. is there a block that i can use to pull RSSI information right off the b210 recieve
[18:43:02] <Crofton[m]> <MarcLichtman[m]> "Everyone learns differently" <- We concluded the conversation with "In forty years, I hope you aren't googling for answers"
[18:43:38] <willcode4[m]> It seems unlikely, even if there is a uhd sensor related to RSSI.
[18:44:06] <mspears-VE3AGS[m> ok is the a block that can output or calculate RSSI?
[18:44:35] <willcode4[m]> How are you defining RSSI?
[18:46:15] <irfan[m]> Can we use Lomb scarlage for normal pulsar period detection ? 
[18:47:30] <willcode4[m]> First I heard of it, but it looks like you can import astropy into a Python block and use that.
[18:47:59] <mspears-VE3AGS[m> I just want a measurement that provides me with a relative receive signal strength that is easy to understand. RSSI to me seemed like the easiest way to measure the receive strength. 0 being I am sitting on top of it, and -100 being way to far out to care....if you get what I mean.
[18:50:08] <willcode4[m]> Sure. There's no calibration in the chain, so you can use something like Probe Avg Mag^2 and add your own calibration.
[18:51:35] <willcode4[m]> There's a RMS block (probably linear, not log).
[18:54:03] <willcode4[m]> Also Complex to Mag^2 -> Log10 -> Single Pole IIR Filter. Maybe the log and iir are swapped.
[18:55:02] <mspears-VE3AGS[m> ok I will play around with it and see what I can come up with
[18:55:56] *** Joins: voltron (~voltrin_@ip4d16bdc6.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[18:57:42] <willcode4[m]> There's code in gqrx that does roughly `10*log10(avg(abs(X)))` where X is the last N samples ... the IIR does sort of the same thing as an average.

[19:40:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Once you have your dB values, you'll need to add/subtract a calibration constant to make them reflect actual power at the antenna input plane.  The numbers coming off an SDR are linearly-proportional to antenna voltage, but you don't know, for any given settings, what the proportionality constant is.

[19:49:03] <Hoernchen> but querying it is quite slow, unfortunately
[19:49:41] <Hoernchen> that being said it's only important if you use agc and don't know what the internal settings are..
