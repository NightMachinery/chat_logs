[06:44:33] <danderson> 450W is the maximum the power supply can deliver. But PC power supplies are adaptive, they're not continuously delivering 450W to the components. They're delivering what's being used, plus a little bit of waste from inefficiency
[06:45:18] <danderson> but switching power supplies (the kind used in PC PSUs) are >90% efficient, often 95% efficient. So if your PC's drawing 100W while you game, that's 100Wh of consumption.
[06:45:30] <danderson> which would be 0.02 GBP/h, at the rate you mentioned.
[06:46:17] <danderson> well, if it's drawing 100W from the PSU, the draw from the plug will be more like 105W or something, if you factor in the inefficiency losses. But still, the main point is, your PC doesn't pull 450W from the wall continuously while it's on.
[06:47:06] <danderson> The way to know for certain, on consumer-grade systems, is to buy something like a Kill-A-Watt and measure the power draw at the wall. Likely you'll find it pulling somewhere in the 50-200W range depending on what you're doing, for a reasonably modern computer.
[06:47:30] <danderson> Possibly even less. My entire server rack runs on about 400W, and that has some seriously chonky machines on it.
[06:49:30] *** Joins: oarion7 (anonymous@user/oarion7)
[07:00:56] <NeoThermic> danderson, to note, you only get 95% from Titanium when you're on 230V; Plat gets you 94%, and gold 92%. You can knock 2% off for running at 110/120V 
[07:01:22] <NeoThermic> and! that's only when you're under 50% load.
[07:01:39] <NeoThermic> I've never seen a non-server 450W plat PSU, so yeah, they're probs gold at best.
[07:04:23] <copier> they're much less efficient at the top end, danderson
[07:04:48] <copier> to my understanding, nonlinearly so
[07:06:03] <NeoThermic> well, ish
[07:06:28] <NeoThermic> the thing to note is that the more wattage you have, the more the efficiency lost costs
[07:08:17] <copier> ah true
[07:08:22] <copier> didn't think about the net aspect
[07:09:00] <NeoThermic> but yeah, the flip side is that higher wattage PSUs are often plat or better anyway
[07:09:05] <copier> danderson doesn't know about nvidia's secret plot to ruin every hope of the planet's escape from fossil fuels by making 300W TDP gpus :^)
[07:09:31] <copier> why can't you use cheaper server PSUs in atx builds, again?
[07:09:51] <copier> i've especially wondered this for mini itx builds where the sff PSUs are fucking spendy
[07:09:57] <copier> why not just $20 lite-on 1200W guys
[07:10:02] <NeoThermic> hah
[07:10:05] <rawktucc> hahaha
[07:10:07] <rawktucc> come on copier 
[07:10:10] <rawktucc> think about it
[07:10:22] <rawktucc> cheap things = cheap output = FIRE
[07:10:31] <rawktucc> Buy a seasonic gold and be done with it
[07:10:35] <rawktucc> you'll never have a problem
[07:10:47] <NeoThermic> I remember when CPC did their first PSU labs, holding them to the ATX spec of the day

[07:12:29] <copier> i have a friend running his mining rig on said $20 lite-on at 450W, has been for like 12 months now
[07:12:30] <copier> 0 fire
[07:12:54] <copier> also we know for a fact that even seasonic makes shitty ripple-heavy PSUs
[07:13:26] <rawktucc> they definitely do but they make better stuff than most

[20:02:38] <rawktucc> So I finally got an answer from Bell about their real unlimited usage limits, on home connections
[20:03:06] <rawktucc> 328TB/month is their actual "unlimited" usage before you get a call from Bell to ask what's going on
[20:03:16] <rawktucc> I was also quoted "5 million TB a month"
[20:04:09] <rawktucc> This is for their FTTH plans

[21:51:01] <KevinCarbonara> ThePendulum: "RGB" keycap just means there's some sort of see-through component to the keycap. The light is on the board

[21:51:19] *** rvalue- is now known as rvalue
[21:51:33] <KevinCarbonara> if you've ever seen keyboards that have light shining through the letters so you could see them in the dark, that's "RGB". Don't confuse it with rainbow vomit aesthetic
[21:51:58] <ThePendulum> ah okay, so any blacklight compatible keycap should do? 
[21:52:18] <ThePendulum> I've got a set of pretty nice PBT keycaps just from aliexpress
[21:53:17] <ThePendulum> completely blank so no transparent markings, but at the time they had loads of transparent double shot keycaps as well 
[21:54:04] <ThePendulum> both my mechs have blacklight but neither are RGB, seems like a bit of a misnomer
[21:54:20] <KevinCarbonara> any backlight compatible keycap, yes
[21:54:34] <NeoThermic> my new gaming laptop has RGB everywhere :D
[21:54:35] <KevinCarbonara> I did some more reading. I really wanted consistent keycaps but they're very hard to find
[21:54:50] <NeoThermic> like, literally I can even config about 140 zones around the side and each key by itself
[21:55:07] <KevinCarbonara> most keycaps are on a different incline based on what row they're on. I don't use a standard layout and I'd like to move them around
[21:56:00] <ThePendulum> yeah, I think DSA and XDA profiles are the flat ones

[23:11:25] <rawktucc> for $10 more why not have the capacity

[23:33:11] <eHAPPY> ah, i recently got upgraded to 1.5gb so was just wondering
[23:33:18] <rawktucc> it's basically impossible to do without the data, peers, or otherwise
[23:34:42] <rawktucc> at which point, if you really are moving almost 1gbit, or higher, every day, all day... you're some kind of business
