[03:07:26] <headius> ok so to round out handle_interrupt logic I will need to bifurcate thread events between blocking operations and other polling
[03:07:37] <headius> possibly... we may basically be doing it only on blocking edges now anywa
[03:07:40] <lopex[m]> numbers
[03:07:51] <headius> but that will fill out the :on_blocking setting for Thread.handle_interrupt
[03:08:02] <lopex[m]> headius is typing
[03:08:12] <headius> it is the only spec we do not pass, and the only MRI test that fails in CI is one that uses it
[03:08:30] <headius> lopex: hello there!
[03:08:35] <lopex[m]> hello
[03:08:51] <lopex[m]> back to the living
[03:08:59] <lopex[m]> I suffered terrible crisis
[03:09:19] <lopex[m]> turned out it was too much smoking
[03:09:43] <headius> well hopefully you are on the mend now
[03:09:53] <lopex[m]> olmost
[03:09:53] <lopex[m]> almost even
[03:10:18] <headius> I will assume you don't have time to look at that transcoder issue and fix it myself ðŸ˜€
[03:10:18] <lopex[m]> also turned out beer want the problem likely
[03:10:28] <lopex[m]> yeah, I've seen that
[03:10:59] <headius> well that's also good
[03:11:02] <headius> I had some gut issues that I was worried were beer but no correlation
[03:11:06] <lopex[m]> I guess it might be too much sugar rich cofee
[03:11:10] <lopex[m]> as well
[03:11:32] <headius> we're getting old my friend
[03:11:38] <lopex[m]> yep!
[03:12:31] <lopex[m]> turned out too much bad cholesterol and sugar in the blood
[03:13:08] <lopex[m]> but it's not that I'm feeling bad physically
[03:13:19] <lopex[m]> it's the brain
[03:13:55] <lopex[m]> some neurological issues 
[03:14:33] <lopex[m]> just like you cant focus on anything or dont have any will to work at all
[03:14:34] <lopex[m]> bleh
[03:16:48] <lopex[m]> now I reduced smoking to a cigarette an hour, and it appears that I'm smoking less than twice
[03:17:14] <lopex[m]> er, more that twice
[03:17:22] <headius> I have that problem without smoking, but this has been a rough 18 months for everyone ðŸ˜€
[03:17:54] <lopex[m]> but imagine, I'm still smoking like 16 cigaretts a day
[03:18:06] <lopex[m]> and it's more than half before
[03:18:20] <headius> yeah good to hear that you have been able to cut back
[03:21:26] <lopex[m]> that transcoder stuff is always tricky to reduce
[03:21:52] <lopex[m]> unless it's an obvious iaobe
[03:22:09] <headius> I would bet on another < vs <= sort of issue
[03:22:21] <headius> I ported that stuff really quickly
[03:22:39] <lopex[m]> yeah, the first thing I'd do is compare to the sources
[03:22:51] <headius> right
[03:23:11] <lopex[m]> per transcoder is not a big deal wrt source size
[03:23:17] <lopex[m]> they're pretty short
[03:23:40] <lopex[m]> but I guess It's not a transcoder data issue
[03:23:59] <lopex[m]> it's a boring copy from binaries
[03:26:06] <lopex[m]> headius: imagine now I'm coding in kotlin mostly lolz
[03:26:11] <headius> nice!
[03:26:29] <headius> make a sample JRuby extension so we can show people how to extend JRuby with Kotlin
[03:26:41] <lopex[m]> implementing banking interfaces
[03:26:55] <headius> actually if you want to do something concrete... we have a PR with some kotlin integration tests but never connected it up ðŸ˜€
[03:26:57] <lopex[m]> not that I'm working for baks, it's just a startup
[03:27:11] <headius> ahh I see
[03:27:28] <lopex[m]> mostly JWS and apis
[03:27:48] <lopex[m]> that JWS is pretty funny
[03:27:58] <lopex[m]> an RFC :P
[03:28:21] <lopex[m]> what can you expect from RFC
[03:28:29] <lopex[m]> and all new internet runs that!
[03:28:50] <lopex[m]> what happened to old XML-DSIG etc ?
[03:29:30] <headius> Java WebStart?
[03:29:38] <lopex[m]> json web signature
[03:29:49] <lopex[m]> there's also json web encryption
[03:30:00] <lopex[m]> and it's all an RFC
[03:30:17] <lopex[m]> well pretty well defined, =
[03:30:24] <lopex[m]> but
[03:31:50] <lopex[m]> on the other hand they have some pretty well maintained impls https://github.com/salesforce/nimbus
[03:32:18] <lopex[m]> or the one from https://github.com/auth0
[03:32:30] <lopex[m]> headius: ^^
[03:32:33] <lopex[m]> er wair
[03:33:02] <lopex[m]> I meant that one https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt
[03:33:17] <lopex[m]> sorry for confusion
[03:34:07] <lopex[m]> but tech wise all that is pretty slickery
[03:34:13] <lopex[m]> comapred to xml
[03:34:27] <lopex[m]> headius: I guess we're too old
[03:36:24] <headius> there does seem to be differences in the code for fun_so_cp50220_encoder
[03:36:36] <headius> starts to diverge about halfway down
[03:36:42] <headius> this may be something they fixed and we never picked up
[03:38:15] <headius> json web signature, ok
[03:38:25] <headius> I was going to say... kotlin and java web start, what an interesting combination
[03:41:03] <lopex[m]> web start is dead isnt it ?
[03:44:55] <lopex[m]> should I check against onigmo or ruby wrt that ?
[03:49:04] <lopex[m]> if it's fun_so_cp5022x_encoder then there's quite a few changes
[03:51:10] <lopex[m]> oh it's fun_so_cp50220_encoder
[03:52:54] <lopex[m]> nothing obvious
[04:08:24] <lopex[m]> ther's also those locale tables that might have changed, bleh
[06:51:08] <headius> I was going line by line and it diverged, but unsure if it is an important diff
[20:17:17] <headius> lopex: you're right, I can't see any issue
[20:18:06] <headius> I looked over the tbl0208 as well and it also matches
[20:56:02] <headius> edipo.federle: you might find this one interesting: https://github.com/jruby/jcodings/issues/42
[20:56:32] <headius> ruby snippit to reproduce... my next step was going to walk through CRuby executing this to see where our jcodings logic diverges:
[20:56:49] <headius> `ruby26 -e '"\x00\x7f\x8e\xa1\x8e\xfe\xa1\xa1\xa1\xfe".force_encoding("CP51932").encode("CP50220")'`
[20:57:36] <headius> this works fine in CRuby and crashes in JRuby
[20:57:52] <headius> I need to finish up 9.3 stuff and this can roll into any release, so I am shifting gears for now
[21:01:35] <headius> actually "\x00\x7f\x8e\xa1\x8e\xfe" is sufficient... it blows on that first 0xFE
[21:01:36] <headius> seems simple but I don't see why we fail and CRuby works
