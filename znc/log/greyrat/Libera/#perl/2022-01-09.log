[02:28:16] <daemon> ah

[02:29:47] <daemon> I actually thought freenode had gone (i.e. servers shut down) but apparently not, they just have incorrect AAAA records for their domain and my client priorizes ipv6 so it looks like its timing out
[02:29:59] <daemon> looked*
[02:30:14] <Grinnz> i'm pretty sure it is dead
[02:30:20] <daemon> no you can sill connect to it
[02:30:21] <Grinnz> they require login through their website now
[02:30:25] <daemon> I wanted to make sure everyone had moved from a particular channel
[02:30:29] <daemon> just use one of the ipv4's
[02:30:37] <daemon> I am not sure if any humans are alive on it
[02:30:42] <daemon> but at least one server works
[02:30:45] <simcop2387> daemon: all the servers that used to be part of it before leenode are gone, but he setup his own and they fucked up the migration
[02:30:51] <simcop2387> and then claimed it was the plan all along
[02:30:53] <Grinnz> there was no migration
[02:31:14] <daemon> there was a mass-migration of users to libera ;)
[02:31:39] <Grinnz> after they fucked that up, they restricted it to sasl logins only so netsplit.de stopped collecting its stats
[02:32:14] <daemon> yeah they aint doing that anymore I went straight in earlier
[02:32:49] <fizzie> It's back at netsplit.de, incidentally. It was briefly under the name "Joseon" there, but apparently now it's back as "freenode" again.

[02:35:30] <daemon> or that yes lol
[02:35:40] <xenu> considering that it seems they lifted the sasl requirement, probably old automatic connections started working again
[02:35:44] <simcop2387> libera is at 48k, and freenode used to be 100k-ish

[16:12:24] <daemon> the issue comes with this:

[16:12:37] <daemon> OpenEyes::Both =>local::at0014|Both eyes simultaneously| vs OpenEyes::Both=>local::at0014|Both eyes simultaneously|
[16:12:39] <lopid> you can tell because they'll be undef
[16:12:41] <daemon> thatspace 'might' be there
[16:12:50] <daemon> I do not want to capture the space
[16:13:02] <daemon> wait that means using multipel regexs
[16:13:06] <daemon> that is what I am trying to avoid

[16:15:25] <daemon> well I spent most of last night in pm with perlbot
[16:15:31] <lopid> heh
[16:15:40] <daemon> any idea how it should be
[16:16:11] <daemon> the problem really is the '(might be a space)=>(might be a space)'
[16:16:12] <daemon> bit
[16:16:25] <fizzie> (\s+)? and \s+? aren't the same thing.
[16:16:32] <fizzie> I mean, even discounting capture behavior.
[16:16:33] <lopid>  ?=> ?
[16:16:52] <daemon> eval: my $x = 'OpenEyes::Long ID With Space =>local::at0014|Both eyes simultaneously|'; if ($x =~ m/^.*?OpenEyes::(.*?) ?=> ?(.*)?::(.*?)\|(.*?)\|.*$/) { return $1 }
[16:16:54] <perlbot> daemon: Long ID With Space
[16:16:58] <daemon> hey that looks good
[16:17:07] <daemon> but surely \s+ and ' ' should match the same thing?
[16:17:34] <daemon> lopid++
[16:17:46] <fizzie> Your \s+? isn't "optional space" at all.
[16:18:08] <fizzie> +? is a non-greedy +.
[16:18:18] <daemon> ah
[16:18:26] <daemon> that is what I was missing
[16:18:39] <lopid> so \s*=>\s*
[16:18:56] <lopid> no need to capture anything
[16:18:57] <daemon> even better because there might be multiple spaces
[16:19:00] <daemon> a human wrote it and all
[16:19:26] <daemon> these weirdo strings are medical mappings between XML and JSON objects
[16:19:32] <daemon> written in excel by someone
[16:19:37] <daemon> >.> I get to parse it
[16:19:38] <daemon> yay me
[16:19:59] <fizzie> If you wanted to go from `(\s+)?` to "exactly the same but don't capture", the closest equivalent would've been `(?:\s+)?`, but of course at that point "1 or more, 0 or 1 times" is just the same as "0 or more times".
[16:21:05] <daemon> so that would be
[16:22:09] <daemon> eval: my $x = 'OpenEyes::Long ID With Space =>local::at0014|Both eyes simultaneously|'; if ($x =~ m/^.*?OpenEyes::(.*?)(?:\s+)?=>(?:\s+)?(.*)?::(.*?)\|(.*?)\|.*$/) { return $1 }
[16:22:11] <perlbot> daemon: Long ID With Space
[16:22:15] <daemon> nice
[16:22:22] <daemon> fizzie++
[16:22:43] <lopid> but why bother?
[16:22:45] <fizzie> But yeah, \s* is a lot more concise than (?:\s+)?.
[16:23:16] <daemon> eval: my $x = 'OpenEyes::Long ID With Space =>local::at0014|Both eyes simultaneously|'; if ($x =~ m/^.*?OpenEyes::(.*?)\s*=>\s*(.*)?::(.*?)\|(.*?)\|.*$/) { return $1 }
[16:23:18] <perlbot> daemon: Long ID With Space
[16:23:25] <daemon> I need to read perlre again
[16:23:44] <daemon> well yeah \s* is nicer because it does not look *to the eye*
[16:23:46] <daemon> like a capture group
[16:24:33] <daemon> you know I think I could actually write some non regex to parse these
[16:24:45] <daemon> by splitting on | and ::
[16:25:10] <daemon> by splitting on | and :: and =>
[16:26:07] <daemon> eval: my $x = 'OpenEyes::Long ID With Space =>local::at0014|Both eyes simultaneously|'; [split(/::|=>|\|/,$x)]
[16:26:09] <perlbot> daemon: ["OpenEyes","Long ID With Space ","local","at0014","Both eyes simultaneously"]
[16:26:19] <daemon> well ... ok a little regex
[16:26:54] <daemon> then again the regex enforces they have not just smashed random crap into the mapping field
[16:27:02] <daemon> correct structure and all
[16:34:27] <daemon> I bet I could even merge them with my new knowledge into a single regex ..
[16:34:29] <daemon> hmm
[16:41:16] <daemon> so ... if I 'might' have a | I don't want to match it
[16:41:33] <daemon> I would do: (?:\|)?
[16:42:12] <daemon> the difference between the two regexs is well: 
[16:42:13] <daemon> OpenEyes::CF=>4|local::at0019|CF - Count fingers|
[16:42:17] <daemon> OpenEyes::Both=>local::at0014|Both eyes simultaneously|
[16:42:23] <daemon> effectively \d+|
[16:42:36] <daemon> so ... (\d+)?(?:\|)?
[16:42:39] <daemon> would that be sane?
[16:42:52] <daemon> I want the number but not the linefeed
[16:43:34] <lopid> \|?
[16:44:06] <daemon> ah! so you can do that with anything
[16:44:07] <daemon> nice

[19:20:31] <Grinnz> that way you know if an object DOES a role, it will have a certain set of methods
[19:20:51] <simcop2387> aquanight: iirc you can get them to do XS, but there's danger in the C code blocking or doing funky stuff.  along with that you need to make sure you have the right libperl build to go against when installing.  it's pretty easy to do if you compile irssi and perl yourself
[19:21:26] <simcop2387> i seem to recall someone doing something fun with timers in irssi, io async, and io async functions, to do background work
[19:22:51] <simcop2387> so doable but not standard
[19:23:15] <arthurpbs> Grinnz thks, makes sense, anyway I was thinking of have a Configurable role so I would require to have one of the named method: conf_file, conf, default_conf and so on, but I think I can likely achieve it without the require statemente, just looking into the $self->can :)

[19:39:23] <aquanight> I'm this close to writing up a CPAN to make it possible for perl to create callcheckers.
[19:39:30] <Grinnz> oh yeah, or perlbrew has it
[19:39:48] <simcop2387> Grinnz: yea i was thinking it was something patchperl could deal with but wasn't sure
[19:40:32] <ehuelsmann[m]> simcop2387: no, I ran the patchperl update just before I ran this perlbrew install command. (the one before was failing too, which triggered the update of patchperl)
[19:40:36] <aquanight> but ah who am I kidding. Attribute::Pure is pretty much ready to go on cpan (far as I know), the only thing stopping me is I don't have a pause, and yet...
[19:41:41] <ehuelsmann[m]> I tried 5.14.3 too, but there's no difference there.
[19:41:49] *** Joins: ology (~gene@user/ology)
[19:42:11] <aquanight> the only real problem with letting perl create a callchecker is then the question of building up optrees in perl (exposing all the new<X>OP functions) and honestly at that point I'd rather find a way to be able let perl build an optree using a precompiled sub as a template.
[19:42:13] <ehuelsmann[m]> I really want 5.14.<something> though, because I want to check compatibility with some commands.
[19:42:28] <aquanight> and then that gets into LINQ-level shenanigans
[19:43:01] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: it's odd, i've got every version of 5.14.X built without issues on debian

[19:46:28] <aquanight> I didn't expect that 'state sub thing {...}' would not produce any optree to set up the lexical sub

[19:47:34] <aquanight> actually what the hell is the introcv/clonecv pair even for? Why are there two separate ops?

[19:53:54] <simcop2387> i'm wondering if you've got a funky header somewhere from ubuntu that's caused h2ph to fail, which honestly would be a failure then that i'd ignore and just do perlbrew install --no-test or whatever that option is
[19:54:39] <simcop2387> it's the kind of thing that might come up building some xs stuff but almost certainly won't and if it does it'll be obvious because you'll get that same failure again

[21:58:00] <aquanight> 08:26:32/5A0D6 < LeoNerd> You often end up with OP_NULLs sitting about the optree ## I still question about the typical layout of 'state with initializer'
[21:58:23] <aquanight> for some reason it goes:
[21:59:12] <aquanight> state $x = 42; -> null { once { null, sassign { const(42), padsv($x) }, padsv($x) } }
[21:59:21] <aquanight> I don't understand why the nulls are there
[21:59:37] <aquanight> they're not even ex-SOMETHING ops that were threaded out
[21:59:41] <aquanight> like ex-list tends to be
[21:59:44] <aquanight> and ex-pushmark
[21:59:59] <aquanight> they're natural born NULL ops
[22:08:23] *** Joins: OnlineCop (~OnlineCop@user/onlinecop)
[22:08:31] <LeoNerd> Sometimes you find real OP_NULLs as part of conditionals, because they make a unique place to put the "end" of a choice

[22:09:56] <Mandevil> Crypt::Passphrase supports several different hashes anyway
[22:12:02] <aquanight> LeoNerd: yeah, it's... kinda weird how it's built
[22:13:03] <aquanight> I guess they're useful to manipulate how the ->next threader builds up the execution chain
[22:13:34] <LeoNerd> It's useful for intermediate state handling
[22:14:32] <LeoNerd> When you sequence two subtrees together, A then B, you need to find the end of the `A` tree, in order to point its ->op_next into the start of B
[22:14:50] <LeoNerd> But consider code like  COND ? $x : $y  Where is the end?
[22:15:18] <aquanight> so you use a NULL to "root" the expression under
[22:15:20] <LeoNerd> The answer is that when you built the cond part, you wrapped the whole thing inside an OP_NULL and have both the $x and the $y PADSV ops' op_next point at that NULL
[22:15:28] <LeoNerd> That way the threader only has to update that single NULL's next
[22:15:46] <aquanight> I can understand that for the toplevel null for the once
[22:15:53] <aquanight> but what the hell is up with the null *inside*
[22:16:02] <LeoNerd> Oh whoknows.. probably junk
[22:16:10] <LeoNerd> They have no runtime effect because they get threaded out
[22:16:19] <LeoNerd> They're only a mild nuisance to optree walkers
[22:16:32] <aquanight> thus they're a mild nuisance to me right now
[22:16:51] <aquanight> because I want to know if someday it'll disappear
[22:16:57] <aquanight> or change in a way I have to deal with
[22:17:03] <LeoNerd> If core's insides are just a Milt Nuisance, you're doing well :)
[22:17:08] <LeoNerd> *Mild
[22:17:17] <LeoNerd> They might change. Try to be a bit robust about things
[22:17:30] <LeoNerd> I try to treat them much like whitespace-skipping in grammars
[22:17:36] <aquanight> I did see there's something commented about something called "targlex"
[22:17:46] <aquanight> but it only affects the initializer op
[22:17:47] <LeoNerd> Write yourself a little "silently skip this pointer over any OP_NULLs" function, and remember to call it often
[22:17:49] <aquanight> the null op is just null
[22:17:52] <LeoNerd> Then you can be robust against them
[22:18:04] <aquanight> I mean that's perfectly fair
[22:18:19] <aquanight> right now I'm just assuming the NULL is part of the expected pattern
[22:18:52] <aquanight> the expected pattern being: NULL, then either SASSIGN or AASSIGN, then PADSV

[23:29:32] <ehuelsmann[m]> simcop2387: the forced install worked for my tests. apparently for the current use-case it's nothing too badly broken.

[23:32:57] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: yea i'm still 90% sure it's some stupid header on your system that triggers a bug in h2ph, but it's probably not terribly likely to be hit unless something is doing stuff with that particular header
[23:33:24] <simcop2387> manually building the perl and examining things yourself probably would make it possible to find, but is that really worth the effort for what you needed?

[23:46:58] <aquanight> on the subject of JSON::PP, which is better: open my $fd, "<file.json", ":encoding(UTF-8)"; my $js = JSON::PP->new; #-or-# open my $fd, "<file.json"; my $js = JSON::PP->new->utf8; ?
[23:47:29] <aquanight> e.g. is there any difference in having the UTF-8 handled by perlio or by JSON
[23:48:41] <buu> oh god
[23:48:45] <aquanight> bah
[23:48:53] <aquanight> I never get the perlio syntax for open right
[23:49:22] <buu> I would assume they do the same thing
[23:49:26] <buu> But I wouldn't trust me
[23:51:35] <vague> aquanight, open my $fd, "<:encoding(UTF-8)", "file.json" #or something similar
[23:51:41] <aquanight> yeah
[23:51:47] <aquanight> that's the variant I'm actually using
[23:51:56] <aquanight> since the file isn't a literal
[23:52:20] <aquanight> point was to just ask if it's better to encode at perlio or in json
[23:53:04] <aquanight> and I don't know if it even matters.
[23:53:35] <vague> Yeah, I have no idea about that either
[23:53:36] <choroba> Doesn't JSON expect bytes on input?
[23:53:53] <choroba> i.e. no encoding of the file?
