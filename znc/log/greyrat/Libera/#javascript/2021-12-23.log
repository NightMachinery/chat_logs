[04:04:00] <FlorianBad> if I have `function some_function_name(x,y){ ... }` is there a way to define another function name that points to it so that I don't have to call it and deal with the parameters like `function new_name(x,y){ return some_unction_name(x,y) }`

[04:16:49] <FlorianBad> onosendi: ok but your paste is exactly what I said I DON'T want to do
[04:17:06] <FlorianBad> and the other thing is a bit of a mystery for me :)
[04:17:34] <FlorianBad> But it seems it's still the same issue, you have to deal with parameters rather than just having another name for the same function
[04:18:14] <onosendi> If a function has params it needs to be dealt with at some point.

[11:31:15] <stenno> ??
[11:31:18] <stenno> i doubt it
[11:31:39] <stenno> you are using XHR which is a technology from 10 years ago

[11:32:08] <stenno> theskillwithin: prob
[11:32:12] <sheetjs> so from the root node, getElementsByTagName("head") wouldn't match, you'd need to match "foo:head"
[11:32:17] <beuys> stenno: I have a bunch of docker containers ready that serve the current dir. I can type "serve_this_dir" and in 1 second the current dir is served. But it is still quicker to just work on files. Also when running multiple servers, you have to deal with port collisions.

[11:36:14] <debayer> haha that is surreal
[11:36:27] <stenno> do you have to fetch files for each and every one of your project?
[11:36:39] <beuys> stenno: Well, one docker container will serve the current dir via Apache, another one via Nginx etc. I only need one at a time.
[11:36:53] <stenno> dude
[11:37:11] <beuys> It is nice to have a docker container for each environment. So you can try different environments in seconds.
[11:37:11] <stenno> you are running fucking APACHE instead of webpack-dev-server?
[11:37:14] <debayer> the ultra-lazy who dont require a build step can just `npm i -g json-server`, now the command `serve` just serves the current directory you are in, picking a different port if unavailable
[11:37:28] <debayer> apache oh dear
[11:40:59] <beuys> debayer: I did that in my early years. But nowadays I prefer to use the same servers locally that I use in production.
[11:41:18] <beuys> A docker container with Apache starts in about a second.

[12:23:27] <stenno> so you do not have a problem with css frameworks, you just don't use them
[12:23:42] <theskillwithin> correct
[12:24:46] <ThePendulum> if I had to make some generic admin panel I might use one, but most projects are either very niche layouts or a client that wants something that stands out, not a generic template
[12:25:47] <theskillwithin> for me its, give me design, i do design
[12:26:06] <theskillwithin> and I do it exact
[12:28:19] <ThePendulum> I also just copy my own css

[13:43:26] <jwpapi> I’m having a question about my setup. I’ve now successfully implemented git in my project. So I develop only locally and then push the changes online, then I go to my server and pull the changes. However I always need to login with personal access token before logging in, which I don’t want to store on my PC. So eventually I end up regenerating it every single time. So in total that’s quite some steps  for small changes.
[13:43:36] <jwpapi> Is there any way to make this simpler?
[13:44:15] <jwpapi> before I was just clicking a shortcut that was uploading to server and it was live and maybe I had to restart the application once.

[19:03:13] <OnkelTem> Hi folks. HTTP question. What do you think would be the proper response from a server when creating a new object via HTTP POST method? Should it be an ID of the newly created object or the full object? Or maybe just 200 + new request to get the object?
[19:04:26] <qswz> Decker: it's once per request, not once per tag
[19:04:45] <qswz> but does nonce make sense from client-side?
[19:04:53] <OnkelTem> I'm designing an API
[19:05:05] <qswz> to me it's like cookies, they only really make sense from server, with client restrictions
[19:07:00] <stenno> OnkelTem: are you trying to write a restful api?
[19:07:08] <OnkelTem> stenno: yep. With OpenAPI
[19:08:28] <OnkelTem> Suppose an object doesn't have an ID and it's up to the databse to create it (autoinc)
[19:08:29] <stenno> OnkelTem: how about returning the serialized object

[19:11:48] <OnkelTem> Yeah, I've already designed it to be just the same object + 200 code

[23:12:26] <nicoty> <ljharb> "nicoty: sure, that works if you..." <- Sure does. That was what I was looking for all along, so I was confused why people were telling me that I needed nodejs, that it was "The Way", and that it wasn't overkill for my needs. I thought I was even pretty clear that I just needed something small and simple. But whatever, I just hope that next time someone asks for some something similar, you guys would be less condescending and actually listen to
[23:12:27] <nicoty> them properly and not just tell them they need to get a laptop and nodejs. It's honestly pretty shitty behaviour.

[23:57:46] <ljharb> Slade: no, you'd use state to "not render it" and then "render it". but why would you ever want to do that
[23:58:04] <ljharb> foo: are you sure canvas.toBlob always provides "blob" to that function?
[23:58:29] <Slade> ljharb, kiosk. i have several forms people fill out. when they're done i basically want to reset the entire thing for the next person
[23:58:47] <ljharb> Slade: so you clear the state and it rerenders that way
[23:59:32] <foo> ljharb: I have little to no idea what's happening here, I really appreciate you taking a look. This fell in my lap with a "this suddenly broke".
[23:59:38] <foo> ljharb: Doesn't help that javascript isn't my forte
[23:59:49] <Slade> ljharb, yea. the way i'm doing it. seems to involve manually calling each setstate (there is about 1 dozen)
