[20:41:54] <Faux> I think they made it illegal in Canada.
[20:42:16] <Renderwww> isn't canada where everything is illegal?
[20:42:30] <Renderwww> like sending money to a trucker and you are suddenly a terrorist or something?
[20:46:47] <Faux> I find that story quite interesting. Unfortunately there isn't a story, and everyone is misreporting shit.
[20:50:21] <Renderwww> I don't really follow it. Only thing I've read was that some truckers went bonkers, stopped trucking and then the government used some ware time law thingy for something
[20:50:41] <Renderwww> so basically I have no clue
[20:51:34] <Faux> Some people blocked a major international border, ruining a load of trade agreements, for months. Government declared a state of emergency, which includes the ability to seize funds, and, as far as has been publicly announced, they basically froze people's gofundmes and the accounts of the already arrested organisers.
[20:52:46] <Faux> Much of the reasonable debate is around whether it's okay to seize money *at all* or whether it's a punitive punishment against someone who has not been proven guilty of anything.
[20:54:44] <Renderwww> reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergencies_Act#Canada_convoy_protest it sounds rather far reaching
