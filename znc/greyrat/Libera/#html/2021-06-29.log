[13:30:41] <cadmio> is there a way to draw this arrow https://imgur.com/FdWWqQrl.png in HTML/Css ?

[13:57:57] <TheSilentLink> Hi I have a hover navbar but on iPad I can open it but I can't dismiss it. If I tap anywhere else nothing happens. Anyone know why?

[14:22:57] <Pilum> TheSilentLink: No. Perhaps if you showed an example someone might be able to figure it out.
[14:25:03] <TheSilentLink> Pilum: https://thesilentlink.org/blog but you need an iPad to see the issue
[14:25:24] <TheSilentLink> if you click on Game Highlights the dropdown appears but if you click anywhere else you can't get rid of it
[14:25:35] <TheSilentLink> you have to refresh the page to dismiss it
[14:26:54] <lilmonkey`> Hover menus are pure cancer. Please don't.
[14:28:56] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[14:29:53] <fkm> TheSilentLink: This doesn't relate to your problem. But if you don't have to support IE, have a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList
[14:30:29] <fkm> Well... You could polyfill for IE. So... have a look :-)
[14:32:35] <TheSilentLink> you mean to add classes?
[14:33:03] <fkm> Or toggle in your current case.
[14:33:19] <fkm> It will make you code much lighter and easier to read (and debug).
[14:34:26] *** Parts: cadmio (~gidna@151.25.147.48) (WeeChat 2.3)
[14:35:43] <fkm> But I wouldn't be surprised if your problem is CSS and/or how Safari handles the hover state. The classList thing is really just a sidenote.
[14:36:39] <TheSilentLink> yep it is in the way safari on iPad handles hover but I was trying to find a workaround.
[14:36:57] *** Quits: xsperry (~as@user/xsperry) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[14:39:53] <fkm> Depending on what it is it can be a downhill battle. I fought more than once against some 'security' or UX feature of Safari.
[14:40:24] <fkm> As lilmonkey` suggested: don't use hover menus :-)
[14:41:37] <fkm> So. I'm off for some gaming. Good luck!
[14:43:00] <TheSilentLink> fkm: thanks for the tip on classlists modified it
[14:43:45] <TheSilentLink> I guess I could not use hover menus yet every site seems to use them and they work fine on iPad so I'm not sure trickery they are using. I wanted less clutter in the bar
[14:44:41] <TheSilentLink> what*
[15:11:31] <lilmonkey`> "every site seems to use them" nonsense. Hover menus are bad even on desktop and even for many abled people. They're a usability nightmare and an accessibility disaster. Please stop using them.
[15:21:27] <TheSilentLink> that's ok I can convert it to a click menu
