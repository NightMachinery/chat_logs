[21:25:57] <BIRDSORTING> i've been forcing one phone into developer mode for years

[21:26:06] <BIRDSORTING> over usb
[21:26:25] <BIRDSORTING> i think i looked into doing it 'safer' and they wanted me to pay 150 bucks a year for a cert?
[21:26:30] <BIRDSORTING> maybe i'm out of touch
[21:26:36] <BIRDSORTING> but i made a new thing as of 6 months ago
[21:26:44] <Renderwww> wasn't google only 100 bucks one time fee?
[21:26:50] <BIRDSORTING> so i just did 'this is my dicky phone for home made dicky stuff'
[21:26:51] <Renderwww> the yearly fee was apple
[21:27:04] <BIRDSORTING> 100 might make sense for 150 in the context of my currency
[21:27:13] <BIRDSORTING> we're usually between 50 and 75 to the usd
[21:27:39] <Renderwww> also I once wrote a shitty android app years ago and it worked without going into developer mode if I remember correctly

[21:29:29] <BIRDSORTING> they are pretty good, i've tested them with other sensors
[21:29:36] <BIRDSORTING> but they all require you install a chinese app

[21:29:41] <BIRDSORTING> which i just noped out of

[21:32:49] <Renderwww> wat
[21:33:03] <BIRDSORTING> haha i didn't know
[21:33:07] <BIRDSORTING> the whole cooking meat at a controlled temperature thing for hours and hours on charcoal
[21:33:15] <BIRDSORTING> is important to me as a vanity meat eating thing
[21:33:25] <Renderwww> sounds like too much effort to me
[21:33:26] <BIRDSORTING> so these phone based bluetooth things are super helpful
[21:33:35] <BIRDSORTING> i just do it for special occasions
[21:33:53] <Renderwww> at work they had slow bbq from time to time where they had some kind of programmable air inlet on the bbq that was remote controlled
[21:34:02] <BIRDSORTING> sometimes you have to show another human that you're 1- a provider of slow cooked meat 2- prepared to provide them slow cooked meat
[21:34:12] <BIRDSORTING> okay that sounds neat
[21:34:18] <BIRDSORTING> how would i even go about automating that
[21:34:25] <BIRDSORTING> we're talking like 200c-400c i'd say
[21:34:30] <BIRDSORTING> plus strong radient heat
[21:34:41] <BIRDSORTING> it's quite a bit of temperature
[21:34:47] <BIRDSORTING> ideally it'd be down closer to 100c
[21:34:56] <BIRDSORTING> but charcoal is a massively dynamic heat source
[21:34:58] <Renderwww> but you don't cook at 200°C for 12 hours, don't you?
[21:35:06] <BIRDSORTING> naah that's the point
[21:35:11] <BIRDSORTING> you cook close to like 80-100
[21:35:20] <Renderwww> https://www.biggreenegg.eu/de/
[21:35:25] <BIRDSORTING> but the problem is that the entire thing has to maintain its heat and also be fueled
[21:35:29] <BIRDSORTING> and there is tons of radient heat
[21:35:38] <BIRDSORTING> i always cook the meat with a strong heat shield under it
[21:35:42] <BIRDSORTING> like the james webb
[21:35:49] <BIRDSORTING> so the shield avoids the meat from getting fucked
[21:35:57] <BIRDSORTING> but also radiates the enclusre to keep it projecting heat
[21:36:19] <BIRDSORTING> if you cut the heat output too much the fuel dies off
[21:36:24] <BIRDSORTING> then you just have cold wet shitty meat

[21:43:00] <Renderwww> but are your shitty bbq sensors internet connected or are they bluetooth only?
[21:43:08] <BIRDSORTING> my housemate got a bunch of those rgb leds
[21:43:11] <BIRDSORTING> for the living room
[21:43:18] <BIRDSORTING> and he had 4? google nest things
[21:43:27] <BIRDSORTING> and he'd come into the living room and clap and say mood lighitng
[21:43:29] <BIRDSORTING> or something
[21:43:34] <BIRDSORTING> and the room would change to a deep red
[21:43:41] <BIRDSORTING> which would have been cool when i was 12
[21:43:41] <Renderwww> if you are happy and you know it clap your hands!
[21:43:55] <BIRDSORTING> anyway i found it dumb cause i'd go in when i was doing night shift
[21:44:01] <BIRDSORTING> and din't want to shout out and wake the family up
[21:44:08] <BIRDSORTING> but also didn't want the app on my phone
[21:44:18] <BIRDSORTING> just so i could cook some food
[21:44:29] <Renderwww> I really don't understand the appeal for most home automation, except maybe for automatically closing and opening the blinds
[21:44:30] <BIRDSORTING> anywya he had tons of shit like that
[21:44:32] <BIRDSORTING> all over the house
[21:44:36] <BIRDSORTING> i was exposed to full iot
[21:44:47] <BIRDSORTING> i can think of one thing
[21:44:51] <BIRDSORTING> that i've only done once
[21:44:55] <BIRDSORTING> i should do it here
[21:45:10] <BIRDSORTING> - geo fence, when you leave your property, disks all encrypt and everything goes to sleep
[21:45:21] <BIRDSORTING> i should really set that up again here
[21:45:33] <BIRDSORTING> i just had my phone gps control it all with some polling sensors
[21:45:38] <Renderwww> uh, just lock your screen when you leave
[21:45:42] <BIRDSORTING> naah
[21:45:56] <BIRDSORTING> i strongly believe in the idea you should be dumb and still be safe
[21:45:59] <BIRDSORTING> because you are made of meat
[21:46:49] <Renderwww> the normal burglar probably just rips out the power cord anyways
[21:47:13] <BIRDSORTING> yeah but i am not worried abut a normal burglar
[21:47:16] <Renderwww> and if the police raids your place because you wrote one hateful comment to many you have other problems
[21:47:25] <BIRDSORTING> i work for a large commercial isp as the head system administrator
[21:47:35] <BIRDSORTING> it's quite a dangerous situation
[21:47:49] <BIRDSORTING> i am constantly worried how fucked i am
[21:47:58] <BIRDSORTING> i am phished weekly
[21:48:04] <BIRDSORTING> phone, email, facebook, etc
[21:48:05] <Renderwww> uhm, keep work computer separate and really just lock it all the time
[21:48:21] <BIRDSORTING> yeah so i have a work laptop and everything is 2fa
[21:48:31] <BIRDSORTING> but i still think about the idea of someone breaking in keeping it alive
[21:48:34] <BIRDSORTING> etc
[21:48:35] <BIRDSORTING> when i'm out
[21:48:40] <Renderwww> close the lid!
[21:48:46] <BIRDSORTING> again
[21:48:47] <BIRDSORTING> made of meat
[21:48:57] <BIRDSORTING> it's better to just fix that than regulate yourself
[21:49:17] <BIRDSORTING> but sure
[21:49:22] <Renderwww> set a auto lock thingy after 10 minutes
[21:49:23] <BIRDSORTING> whenever i go shopping or to visit my friends
[21:49:27] <BIRDSORTING> i power everything down
[21:49:31] <BIRDSORTING> and it's all full disk
[21:49:47] <BIRDSORTING> winds me up when i get back
[21:49:52] <BIRDSORTING> and one device has started up again
[21:50:18] <BIRDSORTING> naah autolock i already have
[21:50:34] <BIRDSORTING> i reckon i need geolocking again but more aggressive than before
[21:50:48] <BIRDSORTING> like leave the house everything reboots into disk crypto decode state
[21:50:58] <BIRDSORTING> i assume such a foss project exists
[21:51:07] <BIRDSORTING> i just do what you said, lids down if i leave
[21:51:20] <BIRDSORTING> but i've had weird problems where laptops don't even sleep properly
[21:51:26] <BIRDSORTING> and intel has just fucked with the system
[21:51:33] <Renderwww> also that tpm that windows uses for bitlocker was hacked if I remember correctly
[21:51:43] <BIRDSORTING> yeah i mean
[21:51:48] <Renderwww> so if you are running windows with full disk encryption on the boot device you are fucked anyways
[21:51:49] <BIRDSORTING> you can only control for so much risk
[21:51:56] <BIRDSORTING> all i have to do is not be culpable in a lawsuit
[21:52:00] <BIRDSORTING> not actually protect a customer
[21:52:06] <BIRDSORTING> (haha, fucked, but true)
[21:52:35] <BIRDSORTING> i figure the way i'll go down is
[21:52:39] <BIRDSORTING> my steam wintendo
[21:52:41] <Renderwww> if they target you I'd be more worried about attaching a hardware keylogger or some shit
[21:52:43] <BIRDSORTING> will get exploited by a game
[21:52:58] <BIRDSORTING> (why aren't video games supply chain hacking, faux said this was unlikely, but still)
[21:53:10] <Renderwww> you could firejail them on loonix
[21:53:12] <BIRDSORTING> and it'll cascade into say, my laptop i watch the expanse on
[21:53:20] <BIRDSORTING> and then it'll some how get into my 3 work laptops
[21:53:27] <BIRDSORTING> like i just know there is a pivot there
[21:53:39] <BIRDSORTING> yeah i know but the problem is humans are lazy
[21:53:40] <Renderwww> also in your case I would set up the router such that the work network is separated from the private fun stuff
[21:53:47] <BIRDSORTING> suddenly i share a key cause i want to copy a file
[21:53:48] <BIRDSORTING> right
[21:53:54] <BIRDSORTING> that's just the nature of being made of meat
[21:54:14] <BIRDSORTING> yeah i have two networks on two ports and they can't see each other
[21:54:23] <BIRDSORTING> but i think there is data leak on this laptop and on my wintendo
[21:54:28] <BIRDSORTING> that i probably don't know about
[21:54:46] <BIRDSORTING> also thanks to log4j
[21:54:56] <BIRDSORTING> maybe my ubuity router can just get owned
[21:55:04] <BIRDSORTING> ubuiti
[21:55:13] <BIRDSORTING> i was wondering about going back to openwrt
[21:55:17] <BIRDSORTING> but i got sketched out about it
[21:55:22] <BIRDSORTING> and it's supply chain is fucked
[21:55:45] <Renderwww> get work to buy you some fancy hardware!
[21:55:48] <BIRDSORTING> mean while i'm sending ubuiti bug reports of their bad bash / ruby / python /java
[21:56:03] <BIRDSORTING> yeah well it'd be all ubuiqi 
[21:56:11] <BIRDSORTING> cause that's what all our commercial properties are on
[21:56:21] <BIRDSORTING> which i'm already on
[21:56:23] <BIRDSORTING> seems dumb
[21:56:27] <BIRDSORTING> monoculture is bad too
[22:01:16] <Renderwww> monocle culture (╭ರ_•́)
