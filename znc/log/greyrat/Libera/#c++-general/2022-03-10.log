[00:44:11] <rpav> seems like the kind of thing people mean when they want an informal "average" .. without the weird cases of mean/median/mode
[00:45:17] <Alipha> lpapp: though returning a std::string_view leaks the fact that you're storing the pointed-to string somehow, and that you're not building the string on the fly.

[00:50:11] <Alipha> among mean, median, and mode, the median is usually the best metric to use, as the mean can be greatly skewed by outliers (e.g., the "mean income of the US" vs the "median income of the US" give rather different values, with the mean being skewed higher because of the million/billionares. whereas the median is a value that is relatable to more americans
[00:53:00] <InPhase> Alipha: A true statement.  And thus consequently, the mean is used more often, and half the time that the median is used, people incorrectly call it an average anyway.  Such is life.  :)
[00:53:26] <Friithian> ah, nothing like lying with statistics
[00:53:45] <PJBoy> but then the median just seems so arbitrary
[00:54:13] <PJBoy> the median value of an experiment of tossing a coin a thousand times is either heads or tails
[00:54:20] <PJBoy> whereas the mean is 0.5 heads/tails
[00:54:47] <Friithian> and that is why it is so easy to lie with statistics, you can easily pick the way to interprate the data to conform to what you want the outcome to be

[01:00:04] <Friithian> no, there's the empty set
[01:00:28] <InPhase> PJBoy: The median does fail hard sometimes in highly discretized scenarios.  It tends to work a lot better for continuum or almost-continuum scenarios.
[01:01:11] <PJBoy> sounds reasonable
[01:01:34] <PJBoy> I feel like outlier removal + mean is a good default though
[01:01:41] <InPhase> It of course also fails in distributions with a huge tail where the tail has most of the meaning.  The median number of programming languages known by humans is zero.

[01:17:30] <Friithian> fuck I hate statistics
[01:17:34] <InPhase> Ultimately they're each a series of tradeoffs for which the proper choice depends on the structure of the data and the desired properties for the systematic and statistical errors.
[01:18:17] <InPhase> There are no single choices.  Statistical analysis is powerful when proper thought is applied, and fragile when it's not.

[18:08:04] <CarloWood> I am not a fan of singletons - which is why I try to create everything at the start of main and never make them a global object.
[18:08:32] <CarloWood> Likewise, I create the Application object as an automatic variable in main().
[18:09:07] <CarloWood> But - there certainly should only be one Application (derived) object :p. So, in a sense this is a singleton or could be one.
[18:09:25] <CarloWood> Now it is very annoying that I have to pass a pointer to this object to everything :/
[18:10:08] <CarloWood> I am tempted to add a static pointer to itself; just wondering if that has any pitfalls.
[18:13:24] <rpav> _effective_ singletons, but avoiding hardcoding them that way definitely seems more elegant
[18:13:59] <rpav> CarloWood: what's nice and the general solution and C++ lacks is dynamic scope
[18:14:18] *** Inline__ is now known as Inline
[18:14:19] <rpav> or "context-sensitive programming", i.e. "what's the current application/logger/etc in my context"
[18:14:22] <CarloWood> Oh? What is that?
[18:14:40] <rpav> basically where you have a "global" but the global only applies to a scope, in a thread
[18:15:30] <rpav> imagine it like a stack and you have a TLS RAII dynamic binding
[18:15:45] <rpav> or ratehr a TLS stack i guess with a raii binding
[18:16:27] <rpav> when you get `auto& logger = *LOGGER;` you get the current/top-of-stack logger, but you can also rebind it for things _you_ call
[18:16:38] <rpav> then when your binding drops out of scope it goes back to the last thing
[18:17:05] <CarloWood> I am not a fan of thread local either... I use a 'task' concept where code that belongs to the task is run by whatever thread from the threadpool that has nothing to do at that moment.  But, for tasks I already have this idea of a "global" that only applies to the scope of that task: member variables of the task object :p
[18:17:24] <rpav> e.g. if you bind log output to a graphical window or stdout or whatever, it doesn't matter, anything using logging just sends output to the contextually-relevant logging device
[18:17:27] <rpav> well
[18:17:54] <rpav> thread-local is only tangentially relevant in that if you do this and it's not thread local, it's going to be a mess
[18:18:37] <rpav> you don't want a dynamic binding in one thread's randomly-called function to affect the dynamic binding in another .. the more important thing is "it's a value on a stack and you get the current thing"
[18:20:15] <rpav> but it "solves" the problem of globals being able to be affected by anyone at any time .. you can change it, but it only gets changed _for you_ for the extent of the current scope (assuming you're rebinding the object, not poking values .. you could make it const, but C++'s const isn't sufficiently-advanced here)
[18:21:17] <CarloWood> I could still do that if I add support for it to the thread pool. I am already doing that in fact, for ImGui. That isn't really thread-safe, since it is using a global variable for access to its state. But, by making that global variable thread-local you can use it with multiple threads.
[18:21:50] <CarloWood> It just means you have to initialize the thread-local pointer every time a thread starts to (possibly) execute imgui code.
[18:22:55] <rpav> yeah tls is sadly suboptimal
[18:23:03] <rpav> it _should_ be _way_ better ;P

[18:23:45] <CarloWood> Fortunately imgui is for debugging only... or I'd worry about how slow thread-local is... It sounds slow.
[18:25:21] <CarloWood> But ok - Application is a true singleton. I think it should work fine to add a static pointer for it.

[19:17:50] <Guest5410> hey I have a question about mysql. I have 1 - many design, where one book maps to many tags. I want to select all books that have all the tag. For example, in this fiddle, I want to select all health checks which are mapped toÂ  "foo_tag1" and "foo_tag2". The output should be the healtcheck with id =1 and data="foo".Â  What's the way to do this?

[19:27:50] <Guest54> OnlineCop that's a typo :)
[19:28:01] <Guest54> sorry about that
[19:28:04] <OnlineCop> `where tag="foo_tag1" and tag="foo_tag2"` <-- wouldn't you want 'or' there?
[19:28:09] <Guest54> http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/fe41bd/2
[19:28:17] <Guest54> OnlineCop not quite actually
[19:28:30] <OnlineCop> How would tag equal two different things at the same time?
[19:28:51] <Guest54> if I do OR, then imagine "foo_tag1" isn't there in the dataset
[19:29:16] <Guest54> then it would return the row with "foo_tag2", which would be incorrect behavior. It should return nothing
[19:29:47] <Guest54> since it's a 1-many design, where one healthcheck maps to many tags. I want to all healthchecks that are mapped to a specified list of tags
[19:30:27] <Guest54> I hope I'm clear, pls let me know if I'm not and I will clarify :)

[21:06:08] <rpav> if your count is 2, then you have matched both tags, because your tag table should not allow multiple of the same tag

[23:06:08] <Alipha> ashafq: shouldn't all your code be "your code"? seems rather pointless. you should consider putting your code into a namespace though, and hopefully all the libraries, etc you use are in namespaces
[23:11:31] <rpav> code belongs to everybody, man! free the code!
[23:11:33] <rpav> ;)
[23:11:34] <ashafq> I was looking at some production code with my_* and I was thinking, shoudn't it be "our_*"?
[23:12:02] <rpav> that implies a lot of responsibility, how about their_*

[23:21:33] <Alipha> bobs_
[23:22:14] <Alipha> But, no, seriously, just remove my_ and put your code in a namespace my_project_name {}

[23:41:47] <rpav> for common things it tends to be a lot ;/
[23:42:10] <rpav> otoh if it's like, whatever_project, most of the .cpp is likely to be `using namespace` and it's mostly going to be in the namespace
[23:44:29] <PJBoy> yeah that's common

[23:48:21] <udet> how to pop a unique pointer from a set so I can move it?
[23:48:34] <rpav> just move it?
[23:49:24] <udet> no, elements of a set are const since they are the key
[23:50:35] <rpav> oh C++
[23:50:38] <udet> so it needs to get taken out of the set before
[23:50:55] <udet> yes, C++... we are in C++ channel :-D
[23:51:11] <rpav> well, actually no, because "taking it out" must be done by a moving mechanism
[23:51:49] <rpav> probably extract()
[23:52:19] <rpav> though tbh i'm not sure why you're using a set<unique_ptr> to begin with, it's sortof redundant
[23:52:24] <udet> yeah, thought about but semms not to do what's expected...
[23:52:33] <udet> probably I stick with a vector
[23:52:45] <rpav> i wondered for a minute why i would have never encountered this, then i realized because you never use set<unique_ptr>, they're _already unique_ .. yeah
[23:52:53] <rpav> the answer is always vector
[23:53:19] <udet> *lol*
[23:53:25] <rpav> though the answer is sometimes tuple, but it's sortof like "static vector"
[23:53:46] <udet> but it would be kind of really nice to use a set for *gg* just because of the name
[23:54:30] <rpav> really someone should (if they have not) make a series of "with_vector" algorithms so you can basically do all the things nicely with vector (as opposed to slightly less nicely)
[23:55:00] <rpav> open_vector() / close_vector() for set/map
[23:56:46] <udet> well, I assum even it would be more nice, I still have then the excuse for better performance by doing propper vector allocations on copying stuff
[23:57:28] <udet> the kind of best excuse to do wrong things having a good intention
[23:57:50] <udet> why did you do? to save performance?
[23:58:14] <rpav> ?
[23:59:04] <rpav> tbh i've never really done the open/close sorted-map-vector thing .. it's better performance in some cases (maybe all cases) but it's not super convenient
