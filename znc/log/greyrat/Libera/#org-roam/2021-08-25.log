[22:07:01] <nickanderson[m]> I have been getting an error "Not an Org time string: 2021" when I try to insert time stamps using org-time-stamp-inactive or org-time-stamp. Seems to come up through org-roam-dailies-calendar--file-to-date. Any ideas?  I thought maybe I had some bad syntax in one of the org files, but I am struggling to find it if that is the case.
[22:07:24] <nickanderson[m]> https://gist.github.com/nickanderson/84eb3c445976627b6afe3c3fe1029eff
[23:25:43] <zaeph> nickanderson[m]: It'd probably be easy to trace if you enabled debug-on-error.  I'm not up to date with the recent changes, so there's nothing that immediately comes to mind here.
[23:26:53] <nickanderson[m]> Yeah the gist above has the output from debug-on-erro
[23:28:16] <zaeph> Oh, sorry, let me check it.
[23:29:17] <zaeph> Yup, that's my shitty hardcoded stuff alright.  I think you're trying to force it to be yearly, and that I've hardcoded YYYY-MM-DD.
[23:30:30] <nickanderson[m]> I was unsure why roam stuff was even being called doing org-time-stamp-inactive
[23:31:04] <nickanderson[m]> but yeah, i was playing around with some dailies captureing to yearly files and others to monthly files
[23:31:32] <zaeph> -dailies is in dire need of refactoring, and I don't think Jethro has dared touch it in recent months, if only to adapt it for v2.
[23:32:06] <zaeph> I've got a long~ list of stuff to address when I'm back.  I'd love to tell you that I'd prioritise this, but I'd rather not make any promise right now.
[23:33:17] <nickanderson[m]> yeah, no worries. I can live with this timestamp insertion not working for the moment (it's been broken for some time now, I guess since I was playing with capturing dailies to not daily files)
[23:34:48] <zaeph> If you're wondering where I've been gone for the last few months: first, holiday, but also, I've mostly been thinking about future designs for org-roam with various communities.
