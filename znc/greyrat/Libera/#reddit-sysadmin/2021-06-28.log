[00:40:49] <sigv> dm only if prod isn’t working)c : XOR can be useful for 'feature flags' and likes. Imagine you want to have a single number which represents some choice of options.
[00:41:38] <sigv> imagine some search function's options. option (a) gives you case sensitive matches, option (b) has some special recursion rules behavior maybe across multiple files.
[00:42:35] <sigv> you could have a lot of booleans -- true/false --, but you might instead want to have one number that has all the information contained in it so that you avoid passing around a lot of booleans.
[00:43:26] <sigv> initial idea could be to represent opt (a) as 1, and then opt (b) as 2, and that works. you take either one of the numbers, or you sum them together to get a 3 for both.
[00:43:53] <sigv> but that means if you have option (c) you cannot use the number 3 -- you have to use 4 instead!
[00:44:34] <sigv> you will quickly notice that due to this 'summing' things together as such you always have some multiple of 2 -- 2 to the power n for each option.
[00:44:54] <sigv> (conveniently 2^0 for the first option.)
[00:45:33] <sigv> and if you represent them in binary, then option (a) is 1, option (b) is 10, and option (c) is 100
[00:46:31] <sigv> wait. you are asking about the _exclusive_ or.
[00:47:12] <sigv> smh, so what I was explaining above is a use case for a binary OR.
[00:47:31] <sigv> where you can then extract whether an option was chosen or not from the number.

[00:48:15] <sigv> XORs are fairly specialized instead. you most likely don't need to work with one. if you have a benefit of one, you will see it.
[00:49:19] <sigv> to put it simply, hardcore number shuffling is what it gets used for. some crypto tasks come to mind.
[00:49:25] <corn266> wow
[00:49:39] <corn266> fuck you sigv
[00:49:45] <corn266> we're a NAND house here
[00:50:08] <sigv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher#Usefulness_in_Cryptography
[00:50:22] <corn266> i'm not hearing any of it, up to your room
[00:50:29] <sigv> corn266: heh
[00:50:41] <corn266> kek
[00:50:52] <corn266> that's pretty interseting though
[00:51:41] <sigv> XOR is messy via NAND itself. but really, if you have to dig this far -- i expect you to have a purpose for these things in hand already.
[00:52:24] <sigv> again - for the exclusive OR, crypto applications come to mind first and foremost, and imo those will be the most practical and fun to experiment with.
[00:53:16] <corn266> the possiblility of a XOR function is equally likely as 1 or 0 for the respectful input 1 or 0

[00:58:24] <corn266> just trying to get his bases covered
[00:58:38] <sigv> let's see if @(dm only if prod isn’t work)c#8369 sees this?
[00:58:42] <sigv> oh well.
[00:58:46] <sd> 14<(​dm only if prod isn’t working)c> nope
[00:58:49] <sd> 14<(​dm only if prod isn’t working)c> lol idk rly
[00:59:19] <sigv> in any case: you take hash's first bit, take key's first bit, XOR them. you have some resulting first bit.
[00:59:30] <sigv> then you take second bit from each, get second bit. repeat for third.
[00:59:51] <corn266> sigv i'd rather randomize it
[00:59:53] <sigv> now you ran out of the key, so take hash's fourth bit, together with key's first bit (loop around to start of key)
[01:00:06] <sd> 13<M​akiTaki> heeey
[01:00:15] <sigv> corn266: many approaches, but i am just explaining a basic setup here.
[01:00:25] <corn266> WE'RE. SENDING. IT. TO . /DEV/URANDOM
[01:00:46] <sigv> if you are shifting key, then you need to either store that information as a separate number (signaling how many bits to shift) or it has to be previously agreed.
[01:00:51] <sd> 13<M​akiTaki> Any of uou play the final fantasy TCG
[01:01:30] <corn266> how do you not cache the previous key, though?
[01:02:31] <sigv> oh, the key could be getting randomized for each hash, and exchanged out-of-band as well, of course. i expect there is a pre-determined 3-bit key in this case.
[01:02:54] <sigv> reading from above: there is some hash. there is a known 3-bit key. decrypting is being carried out.
[01:03:40] <sd> 15<c​howkugelblitz> :kappaduo:
[01:03:53] <sigv> dm only, let me know if i can help out with something more specific.
[01:04:01] <corn266> oh maybe i misread, you cache the offset or the key in either case. however your explaination has entirely thrown me off and i'd like a wiki article or something

[09:28:16] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, its definitely is. all of my devices are having problems, and the Upstream/Downstream light on the modem keeps dropping in and out
[09:29:02] <xe0n> get them to give you another modem to test?
[09:29:04] <xe0n> could be the moooodeemmmm
[09:29:05] <xe0n> haha
[09:30:29] <Jay-Ros> have they tried turning the current modem upside down and shaking it like an etch-a-sketch?
[09:30:49] <xe0n> yeah!!!
[09:31:04] <Jay-Ros> have you tried using another modem next to it to make it jealous?
[09:31:26] <xe0n> have you tried waxing it to make it go faster?
[09:31:37] <Jay-Ros> gotta leave the landing strip though
[09:31:55] <xe0n> has your modem got speed lines? i hear they make things work better
[09:32:23] <Jay-Ros> I put a playing card in the fan on mine like an old school bicycle
[09:32:44] <xe0n> spokey dokeys!
[09:33:32] <Jay-Ros> https://cdn-o.fishpond.com/0257/786/224/1299534094/original.jpeg
[09:33:35] <Jay-Ros> this guy knows
[09:34:24] <Jay-Ros> Although I don't know why he's got them on his pushy... he's married. That's dangerous
[09:48:10] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, they replaced the modem like 3 months ago, because mine was outdated
[09:48:22] <Cl0udNinja> Jay-Ros, jokes on you, I keep the modem upside down to better communicate with australia
[09:48:58] <Jay-Ros> <3
[09:50:29] <Cl0udNinja> I hate having to deal with ISP support, when I called today, I had internet, the lady did something, and then tried to leave me without internet after scheduling a tech
[09:50:53] <Cl0udNinja> ended up not having internet anyway because like 30 minutes later there was another fucking outage
[09:56:10] <xe0n> huehue
[09:56:27] <xe0n> have you tried joining your neighbour's wifi?
[09:57:15] <Cl0udNinja> I.... didnt get wireless for my new computer ... lol
[09:57:35] <Cl0udNinja> "I never use the wireless anyway, what good is it"
[09:57:39] <JollyRgrs> you have ZERO wireless devices?
[09:57:43] <Cl0udNinja> me today: "Man, I could totally be tethering today"
[09:58:01] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, I mean, I have my phone, but I have no wireless on my desktop system
[09:58:30] <xe0n> whaaaa
[09:59:21] <Cl0udNinja> I think I might have an old pci wireless buried in my box of relics but too much effort to dig for it
[09:59:38] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: but you just said you had issues on "all my devices"
[09:59:45] <JollyRgrs> do all your devices consist of your single desktop?
[09:59:52] <Cl0udNinja> desktop, phone
[10:00:00] <JollyRgrs> so your phone is wired?
[10:00:10] <Cl0udNinja> no, its wireless... I said that
[10:00:10] <JollyRgrs> if you tested your phone on wifi, then test it on neighbors wifi :P
[10:00:35] * JollyRgrs farts a DNS query to gibbyfarts.com
[10:00:50] <Cl0udNinja> anyway... both phone and computer would lose connection to the internet
[10:01:11] <Cl0udNinja> and I've been running an MTR for the last 48 hours, the failure is always either my modem, or the hop after it
[10:01:51] <xe0n> sounds like you need to order a wifi card for your desktop, then log onto neighbour's wifi
[10:01:52] <xe0n> :D
[10:02:00] <Cl0udNinja> I'd just tether :P
[10:02:52] <Cl0udNinja> but yeah, I think unfortunately, I'm probably gonna buy a wifi card eventually, but I got other shit that I gotta pay for atm
[10:03:46] <JollyRgrs> if not, try a power over ethernet adapter and ask your neighbor to borrow an ext. cable to run into your window from theirs
[10:03:50] <JollyRgrs> ezpz
[10:03:57] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[10:04:31] <xe0n> i think the solution involves your neighbour either way
[10:04:39] <xe0n> it could be them leeching internet off you and busting it
[10:04:46] <xe0n> have you asked them if they have draaamaaaazzzzzzz
[10:04:54] <xe0n> and then follow up with whats your wifi password
[10:05:02] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[10:05:14] <Cl0udNinja> theres enough open wifi points they'd be unlikely to go stealing mine
[10:06:00] <A-KO> ahhh what's up
[10:06:18] <Cl0udNinja> ISP said 'theres some signal "strangeness"'
[10:06:32] <Cl0udNinja> but thats super useless info to me, since they wouldnt say more
[10:07:01] <xe0n> well you can't really assist either way lol
[10:07:03] <xe0n> so whats it matter?
[10:07:15] <Cl0udNinja> I'm not satisfied with shit answers?
[10:07:21] <xe0n> there's issues on the line
[10:07:24] <xe0n> rephrase it :P
[10:07:43] <xe0n> i bet its those ethernet cables your neighbour ran for their automated watering system in the front yard
[10:07:45] <xe0n> interference
[10:07:51] <xe0n> see, neighbours come back into the equation
[10:07:51] <xe0n> :P
[10:08:01] <Cl0udNinja> impossibru!
[10:08:09] <xe0n> NO NO U!!
[10:08:13] <Cl0udNinja> my line comes straight from the pole to my house, the pole is right next to the house
[10:08:37] <Cl0udNinja> though... now that I think about it... AT&T were out here running line a few weeks ago, and the problems started around then
[10:08:50] <Cl0udNinja> I wonder if they knicked some cables or something with their line spooler dealy thingy
[10:09:19] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: what are you on? cable? dsl? fiber?
[10:09:23] <Cl0udNinja> cable
[10:09:35] <JollyRgrs> what's the power/snr ?
[10:09:41] <JollyRgrs> many times that's an issue with cable modems
[10:09:43] <Cl0udNinja> idk
[10:09:54] <Cl0udNinja> its a blackbox modem
[10:10:00] <JollyRgrs> at the junction box in the street, neighbor complained about signal, so they moved some wires around and now YOU have their problem
[10:10:08] <xe0n> ++++
[10:10:08] <JollyRgrs> you can log into it still
[10:10:12] <xe0n> beem there
[10:10:14] <xe0n> been*
[10:10:15] <JollyRgrs> comcast?
[10:10:18] <xe0n> i had that happen to me
[10:10:22] <Cl0udNinja> Cox
[10:10:23] <xe0n> "oh lets just switch the pair...yep you're good to go"
[10:10:38] <xe0n> neighbour: why my internet funky now?
[10:10:40] <xe0n> rinse, repeat
[10:10:45] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[10:10:55] <JollyRgrs> your modem still has a LAN IP... google up "cox modem ip"
[10:11:06] <JollyRgrs> you have a TON of stats you can look at (and logs)
[10:11:09] <Cl0udNinja> I know the IP, I dont know the login info
[10:11:12] <xe0n> ewwor wogs
[10:11:16] <JollyRgrs> OMG brah
[10:11:19] <xe0n> default\password
[10:11:21] <Cl0udNinja> I've loooooked
[10:11:21] <JollyRgrs> the internet has it
[10:11:21] <xe0n> default\default
[10:11:24] <xe0n> admin\pass
[10:11:27] <JollyRgrs> what's the modem model?
[10:11:28] <Cl0udNinja> they arent defaults
[10:11:36] <xe0n> default2\newpassword
[10:11:39] <Cl0udNinja> because the defaults are stickered on to the bottom and they dont work
[10:11:46] <xe0n> pass: hunter2
[10:11:49] <JollyRgrs> so hard reset the modem
[10:11:52] <JollyRgrs> hold down that reset button
[10:12:02] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, you think I havent done these things?
[10:12:19] <JollyRgrs> so you just have a straight up modem? no voip or anything else from it, right? not a gateway, just a legit modem?
[10:12:21] <Cl0udNinja> I tried as soon as they swapped me to this modem and gave up that day after trying
[10:12:29] <JollyRgrs> go buy one at bestbuy for 50-100 and use your own
[10:12:42] <JollyRgrs> or demand they give you the login to look at signal strength and logs, etc.
[10:13:14] <JollyRgrs> srsly, i'd go crazy if i couldn't log into the modem to see that they are pushing a (failing) firmware update every night and that's why my internet was cutting out (thanks AT&T)
[10:13:47] <xe0n> gimme gimme gimme a firwmare after middddniiight
[10:14:28] <A-KO> that happened to me once JollyRgrs
[10:14:47] <JollyRgrs> lol
[10:14:58] <JollyRgrs> they were like "oh, that's b/c your modem is stank old, we send new one"
[10:15:01] <JollyRgrs> they sent the same one
[10:15:04] <A-KO> lol
[10:15:05] <A-KO> nice
[10:15:31] <A-KO> I once went to Comcast with a modem and said "Hey I'm returning this because I bought my own" and I said "don't cut off service, I'm just returning the modem." I get home....guess what they did?
[10:15:32] <A-KO> lol
[10:15:34] <JollyRgrs> a year later, issues... they are like "b/c you got stank old modem, we send new one" i said "you said that last time a year ago and sent same model "no, this time new one"
[10:15:36] <JollyRgrs> i get old one
[10:15:42] <JollyRgrs> finally, this last time i got the newer model
[10:15:51] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: oh yeah
[10:16:18] <JollyRgrs> we sold so many surfboards at bestbuy, had to scan MAC, etc. so that comcast would have it in the system (or comcast at the store would do it)
[10:16:20] <xe0n> I BUY MY OWN MODEEMMMMMMM
[10:16:26] <JollyRgrs> go home... nope, gotta call up and ahve them activate the modem still
[10:16:29] <xe0n> haha surfboards, classic
[10:16:37] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: i used to, it was $10/mo rental
[10:16:45] <xe0n> wow lol
[10:16:48] <JollyRgrs> then comcast dropped to $2 and it was easier to let them replace one
[10:16:51] <JollyRgrs> ROI was too long for that
[10:16:56] <JollyRgrs> then it went back up to $10/mo
[10:17:10] <JollyRgrs> ATT won't let me use my own
[10:17:24] <JollyRgrs> they use cert-based auth and the cert is pushed to only their modems
[10:17:28] <A-KO> ew
[10:17:29] <A-KO> that's lame
[10:17:31] <JollyRgrs> at some point i want to look into the work around
[10:17:56] <JollyRgrs> i gotta break RFC and do some loop on a 2nd eth port to let the auth pass through and everything else bypass the modem
[10:18:14] <JollyRgrs> only way to (currently) bypass using an ATT gateway
[10:18:15] <xe0n> i see....
[10:18:25] <JollyRgrs> which theirs do NOT do pure passthrough, only simulated
[10:18:32] <xe0n> well dats lame
[10:18:33] <JollyRgrs> so there's still some table limitations, etc.
[10:18:35] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[10:18:49] <JollyRgrs> i'll have to take time to fiddle... and obv. that'll be downtime
[10:18:59] <JollyRgrs> with a wife and 2 kids... i don't got that kind of change winodw
[10:19:09] <A-KO> lol
[10:19:15] <A-KO> mmmmm water
[10:19:16] <Cl0udNinja> tfw your home requires change windows
[10:19:28] <A-KO> so I'm trying to massively reduce soda intake again
[10:20:24] <Cl0udNinja> I've been tryin to as well, sadly the carbonated water I like isnt sold in bulk so its been hard
[10:21:17] <A-KO> it's been bad. I've been terrible. I'm not completely killing soda, but I am trying hard not to have any in the house.
[10:21:26] <A-KO> So over the weekend if I drink any it's because I go out, but at home I'm drinking water, etc.
[10:21:30] <xe0n> yeah lay off the soda
[10:21:38] <A-KO> I'll slowly start killing it elsewhere, too.
[10:21:58] <xe0n> if you like flavour, look at mineral water
[10:22:02] <xe0n> you can get some infused flavours and such
[10:22:07] <xe0n> thats what i drink when i want something sweet
[10:22:11] <xe0n> no sugarrr
[10:22:30] <A-KO> I fell down a hole of depression
[10:22:35] <A-KO> and trying hard to get out of it :)
[10:22:47] <xe0n> every now and then i'll treat myself to soda (dr p ayy ayyy), but otherwise yeah nah
[10:22:50] <xe0n> i cut juice out too
[10:22:56] <xe0n> but i do get a small bottle every now and then
[10:22:58] <xe0n> if its on special
[10:22:58] <xe0n> lol
[10:23:00] <A-KO> lol
[10:23:02] <xe0n> its a fucking rip
[10:23:19] <xe0n> beer though, errrrrr that.....yeah
[10:23:19] <xe0n> LOL
[10:23:24] <A-KO> lol
[10:23:42] <A-KO> I need to lose weight, badly. So yeah..cutting soda....good start
[10:23:47] <Cl0udNinja> I've still been unable to cut my monster habit
[10:23:49] <A-KO> I still like me an ice cold coke though
[10:23:52] <xe0n> yup and do cardio
[10:23:56] <A-KO> Cl0udNinja: get rehabs?
[10:24:04] <Cl0udNinja> Ultras
[10:24:11] <Cl0udNinja> no sugar/lo/no carb
[10:24:12] <A-KO> I've had a bit of a red bull problem lol
[10:24:23] <Cl0udNinja> I have at least cut back from how many I was drinking 
[10:24:40] <A-KO> I had a hardcore monster rehab problem for a while
[10:24:59] <A-KO> but I don't know what it is, but the distributor here has simply not had any
[10:25:04] <A-KO> so now I drink red bull at work :/
[10:25:06] <Cl0udNinja> I drink about 2 monster a day
[10:25:18] <A-KO> I'm at 2 redbulls/day. That's the next thing I gotta tackle
[10:25:19] <A-KO> lol
[10:25:26] <Cl0udNinja> I used to be at 4... :S
[10:25:40] <xe0n> oh 2 a day
[10:25:41] <xe0n> dammn
[10:25:43] <xe0n> how big your wings?
[10:25:44] <Cl0udNinja> but I was workin 10-12 hour+ days, 6 days a week, plus traffic
[10:25:59] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: i prefer just iced water (tap or spring) to anything else when i'm trying to watch what i drink... but certain meals need sweet tea or a soda.
[10:26:19] <Cl0udNinja> the tap water here is ass or I would drink it
[10:26:20] <A-KO> JollyRgrs: indeed. My issue was I was drinking them.....as my main source of fluid
[10:26:21] <A-KO> bad idea
[10:26:21] <JollyRgrs> when i try to cut out and lose weight, i only drink a soda VERY OCCASIONALLY and treat it as a dessert, not as part of the meal
[10:26:22] <A-KO> lol
[10:26:25] <JollyRgrs> or i'll just keep getting refills
[10:26:27] <Cl0udNinja> cant get past the bleach taste
[10:26:29] <xe0n> no wonder ya got the shits!
[10:26:29] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[10:26:43] <A-KO> I have a Pur water filter in the fridge
[10:26:53] <JollyRgrs> i prefer the taste of spring water
[10:26:58] <JollyRgrs> but i'm picky about where
[10:27:02] <A-KO> I actually really like Fiji water
[10:27:04] <Jay-Ros> Chinese gold leaf tea FTW
[10:27:08] <JollyRgrs> i mtn water can be good, but sometimes a bit too metallic
[10:27:11] <A-KO> but Irvine's water when chilled and filtered isn't bad
[10:27:21] <JollyRgrs> fiji is nice, but hellaspensive
[10:27:25] <Jay-Ros> all the caffeine, none of the heartburn
[10:27:30] <A-KO> Fiji's bottled water for some reason is like.....I dunno how to describe it
[10:27:47] <A-KO> like water out of my tap feels.....more thick consistency than fiji water lol
[10:27:49] <xe0n> its like tasting fresh water from fiji?
[10:27:54] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: the diff minerals make water taste diff... contrary to ppl trying ot say water doesn't have a taste
[10:28:06] <A-KO> water absolutely has a taste
[10:28:06] <xe0n> psssh it sure does
[10:28:08] <JollyRgrs> i mean pure water (distilled) doesn't really... but all the others (tap, spring, mountain) do
[10:28:09] <A-KO> I don't like Aquafina
[10:28:16] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: some of that you taste teh bottle
[10:28:27] <JollyRgrs> i prefer dasani to aquafina
[10:28:31] <A-KO> it could be the bottle, but I dunno, the water just feels....fresher?
[10:28:33] <A-KO> yeah
[10:28:34] <JollyRgrs> but both are just municiple tap water, filtered
[10:28:46] <JollyRgrs> but the blue plastic "taste" tastes better
[10:28:51] <A-KO> lol
[10:28:59] <JollyRgrs> same with soda out of Al cans vs glass bottles, or out of a plastic cup
[10:29:11] <JollyRgrs> you def. mix the drink with the container for taste
[10:29:20] <JollyRgrs> water is just more direct b/c water isn't really masking it
[10:29:26] <xe0n> "When you load an image into WSIM, the image may display as a Windows 10 image even if it's a Windows 11 image. This is a known issue and you can use WSIM to customize your Windows 11 deployment, even if the image name is different than what you expect."

[10:30:52] <xe0n> ummm not lockdown, but masks and restrictions start again tomorrow
[10:31:04] <xe0n> eh the gov has screwed up with the rollout
[10:31:05] <xe0n> sooo
[10:31:05] <xe0n> lol
[10:31:11] <Jay-Ros> how did he say that with a straight facce
[10:31:14] <Jay-Ros> that is amazing
[10:31:59] <A-KO> I expect mask mandates again here due to the delta variant nonsense
[10:32:24] <xe0n> yeah delta here
[10:32:31] <Jay-Ros> A-KO Sydney is in lockdown though
[10:32:46] <A-KO> numbers are spiking in california again a bit
[10:32:48] <xe0n> COOOOOOUNT...i mean LOOOCKKKKDOWNNNN

[10:32:57] <Jay-Ros> yeah we had 18 cases today
[10:32:59] <A-KO> like average of 700-900 cases/day. Past couple days have breached well over 1000
[10:33:14] <xe0n> rona just doesnt wanna leave the party

[11:01:01] <xe0n> coo-ber-net-ees
[11:01:13] <Hempux> And if you pronunce it with a heavy southern accent i guess it sounds like Keubern eight ies?

[12:59:46] <sigv> "secure" multi-factor is hard to make "user-friendly" (read as: lowest denominator)
[13:01:06] <sigv> either you need to put in a bunch of resources into R&D, to make a solution for your specific situation (e.g. Steam Guard, I suppose)
[13:01:24] <sigv> or you get a.. less secure solution that works for most.
[13:02:03] <sigv> would say having SMS-based second factor is still better than not having a second factor whatsoever -- because that is what it often will boil down to.

[16:57:01] <xe0n> why would some dude who is your typical average joe walk into a store and buy a pc when it looks the same as the crusty one he had at home (which prob got the freebie 10 upgrade forever ago)
[16:57:09] <xe0n> why buy the same car if it looks the same as the old one?
[16:57:26] <DrZak> coz the old one breaks down?
[16:57:28] <nobyk> (except for when the current one is broken)

[16:58:07] <rpifan> xe0n, thats a good point like the model year of a car must change every year 
[16:58:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> you pay a bit more but 
[16:58:16] <DrZak> chipset drivers are still shit with amd
[16:58:19] <DrZak> fuckin retards
[16:58:21] <rpifan> i heard 18 months was the average life of a cell phone
[16:58:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> I upgraded from an iPhone 8 to an iPhone 12 Pro
[16:58:32] <DrZak> it kept bsoding if i used the chipset drivers from arseus
[16:58:34] <xe0n> yeah 18-24 months you've got your money worth, any longer, great
[16:58:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> heh
[16:58:44] <DrZak> with amd drivers not so much, but occassionally still

[18:58:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> shibboleth i dunno? 
[18:58:45] <AnonymooseReddtr> i mean they can totally not do it 
[18:58:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> but 
[18:59:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> win11 is a "free" upgrade so maybe they are expecting more people to take it up?

[18:59:29] <estranger> i like subscription models.... when im the vendor 
[18:59:40] <shibboleth> well, oems/retailers are selling w10 pcs right now that don't meet the win11 requirements
[18:59:41] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, those are the best.
[18:59:48] <teh_f4ll3n> when you're the vendor
[19:00:03] <estranger> then again we have to earn your business aain every year
[19:00:21] <teh_f4ll3n> shibboleth, they'll be selling them off on amazon at 50% off
[19:00:23] <estranger> and contracts are easier when its not maint/support vs software
[19:00:29] <mistiry> shibboleth: might not have the TPM tunred on, but any new PC being sold should meet the minimums
[19:00:52] <mistiry> nearly all procs in the last 4-5 years have had TPM, many just have it off in BIOS 
[19:00:59] <shibboleth> seen many consumer laptops with tpms, have we?
[19:01:11] <shibboleth> in retail
[19:01:48] <PublicWiFi> yeah most mobos in the past 5 years have tpm, even shit ones
[19:01:59] <shibboleth> mistiry, ftpms?
[19:02:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> i suspect those requirements will change some too
[19:02:08] <teh_f4ll3n> does win 11 need TPM on?
[19:02:11] <mistiry> yes

[19:02:18] <teh_f4ll3n> welp
