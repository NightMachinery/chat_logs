[01:45:47] <MatSharrow> Are chroot jails still good practice or have then been replaced by linux process groups and/or containers?
[01:47:40] <leonarth> all jails can be escaped as we can hook into exported syscalls
[01:48:03] <wilsonfisk> that's a broad statement
[01:48:29] <leonarth> it's a deterrent, not a protection
[01:48:32] <betterOn1> leonarth, tomreyn: are there keywords for me to search for it? because network subject is too wide :(
[01:48:56] <leonarth> vpn clients have this option usually, look for it
[01:49:08] <betterOn1> leonarth: i checked it but it doesnt have..
[01:49:35] <leonarth> you have the settings in a .opvpn file? try modifying it with that option
[01:49:50] <leonarth> otherwise it could also be that your vpn server is "forcing" all traffic through the vpn as a rule
[01:50:06] <leonarth> which the client will comply with
[01:50:29] <yippeekaiyay> vm escape can happen with any hypervisor. I'm not sure if there's an underlying assumption here that there's something inherently secure about using chroot which is more basic than VirtualBox or VMware
[01:50:47] <yippeekaiyay> I wouldn't call chroot a hypervisor - not saying that either
[01:51:45] <yippeekaiyay> So, I should rephrase that. It's possible to escape any sandboxed environment.

[01:53:32] <leonarth> yippeekaiyay up to this patch, yes
[01:53:53] <tomreyn> betterOn1: usually, vpn clients will update your local routing table so that traffic to subnets/networks which exist on the other side of the vpn connection will be rputed through the vpn, but traffic directed to subnets/networks not available on the remote end of the vpn would not be altered, i.e. such traffic should still be routed through your default gateway.
[01:54:59] <leonarth> tomreyn the vpn server can ask the client to route all traffic through the vpn regardless
[01:55:18] <MatSharrow> But if I were to try and sandbox a server process what would be the current best practice?  Is chroot still used generally?
[01:55:55] <leonarth> openvpn has the setting: redirect-gateway
[01:56:08] <tomreyn> leonarth: sure, it could do all kinds of things to your routing table, or none.
[01:57:06] <yippeekaiyay> Thanks for that link!
[01:57:23] <leonarth> MatSharrow depends what you want to do, chroot just changes the root directory for that user or group
[01:57:56] <leonarth> e.g. the root is / with chroot you can make /hello/world and when I login I can be only there, I cannot go to /
[01:58:00] <yippeekaiyay> I have always thought that chroot is preferable if or, for the most part, you just need something based in the cli.

[01:59:30] <leonarth> MatSharrow if that's all you want, restrict where a user can go use chroot -- if you want to also control resources a user can use e.g. ram,cpu,network etc then use cgroups
[01:59:32] <yippeekaiyay> This seems like mostly a coding group in terms of the InfoSec. I hear disproportionately more chat about that over network hacks or vulnerabilities. But that could just be because I'm new

[02:40:09] <ajak> who told you that?
[02:40:15] <yippeekaiyay> Who told me what?
[02:40:26] <ajak> that the 'server' rejects vpn connections
[02:40:44] <yippeekaiyay> Well, it came up two night ago and multiple users said this.
[02:40:52] <yippeekaiyay> Plus, when I'd try to use this with a VPN, it wouldn't work
[02:41:02] <yippeekaiyay> So, they are simply wrong?
[02:41:03] <ajak> well, obviously it does
[02:41:05] <ajak> yes
[02:41:07] <yippeekaiyay> Yep
[02:41:12] <yippeekaiyay> Well, there's that
[02:41:16] <ajak> if you are very sure you're connecting to libera through the vpn
[02:41:28] <yippeekaiyay> I'm damn sure
[02:41:40] <yippeekaiyay> And I can verify the VPN is working in multiple ways
[02:42:00] <yippeekaiyay> Nice to have Wireshark run and just see it all
