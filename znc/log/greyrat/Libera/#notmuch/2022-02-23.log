[18:30:08] <seanw> I have a list of lines which are ORed together like this: (line1) or (line2) or (line3)
[18:30:21] <seanw> one such line is: subject:("Cron <dak@" and "sudo -u dak-unpriv /srv/")
[18:30:56] *** Joins: seschwar (~seschwar@user/seschwar)
[18:32:23] <seanw> but when that it is in there it breaks the whole search; stuff that ought to be included is not
[18:32:38] <seanw> I suspect, but haven't confirmed, that it's all the disjuncts that come after that one that break
[18:32:55] <seanw> on its own that search works fine and turns up a single message.
[18:33:04] <bremner> did you try with NOTMUCH_DEBUG_QUERY=t ?
[18:34:02] <seanw> gosh that's a lot of output, what should I look for?
[18:35:18] <bremner> I guess for starters does the query string look like it escaped shell mangling?
[18:35:21] *** Joins: bitblit_ (~bitblit@gateway/tor-sasl/bitblit)
[18:36:12] <seanw> yes.  I'm constructing it and passing it via perl's system() with multiple arguments, so no shell involved.
[18:36:35] *** Quits: bitblit (~bitblit@gateway/tor-sasl/bitblit) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:37:37] <bremner> oh. For constructed queries, s-expressions are probably better, but that's a different discussion.
[18:38:48] <bremner> OK. I suspect that subject: is not "distributing" like you want. It expands more more sensibly if I write subject:" " and subject:" "
[18:38:48] <seanw> each of the disjuncts is just a line of text however.  but thanks for pointing that out, I hadn't even considered it.
[18:39:19] <seanw> okay let me try that
[18:40:34] <seanw> yeah that seems to fix it.  but it is a bug, right?
[18:43:04] <bremner> probably yes, but possibly quite difficult to fix. No harm in reporting it though.
[18:44:09] <seanw> okay will do
[18:45:51] <seanw> I tried getting adj and near to work yesterday; I ran into similar sorts of issues with parts of the query being wiped out
[18:45:59] <seanw> don't have a convenient test case rn.
[18:47:59] <bremner> seanw: basically watch out for prefixes supporting regex search, as that is bolted onto the xapian query parser in a not too elegant way
[18:48:53] <seanw> ah interesting, thanks
[18:49:40] <seanw> I do have a bunch of those earlie rin the disjuncts
[18:49:46] <seanw> (this is a very long mark-as-read thing)
[18:49:53] <seanw> (recently converted from sieve)
[18:52:02] <seanw> oh, i guess the /srv/ looks a bit like a regex, maybe that it is.
[18:53:03] <bremner> you could strip punctation or replace it with whitespace; xapian is going to anyway.
[18:53:56] <bremner> I guess it's a bit more tricky than that. foo-bar is a phrase equivalent to "foo bar"
[18:55:27] <seanw> the / is punctuation?
[18:56:51] <bremner> "Terms and phrases" in notmuch-search-terms(7) probably explains it better.
[18:57:22] <bremner> and may give you reference queries to complain about in your bug report :P
[18:57:52] <seanw> well slashes inside the double quotes ought to be treated literally, that scetion suggetss
[18:58:51] <bremner> ah right. That might even be related to the bug. notmuch can't tell that the string was originally quoted, and tries some heuristics to figure it out.
[18:59:33] <seanw> it can't?  as I'm not going via the shell, it gets the double quotes.
[18:59:53] <bremner> yes, but then it goes into the xapian query parser before notmuch sees it
[19:00:16] <seanw> ah I see
[19:00:19] <bremner> even inside quotes it isn't _literal_
[19:00:29] <bremner> let me make a simple example...
[19:01:17] <bremner> NOTMUCH_DEBUG_QUERY=t notmuch count 'subject:"foo /bar/"'
[19:01:33] <bremner> notice there is no "/" in that query.
[19:05:35] <bremner> BTW notmuch search --query=sexp '(subject (and "Cron <dak@" "sudo -u dak-unpriv /srv/"))' looks like it works OK

[19:34:56] <seanw> bremner: hmm so I could just drop the slashes maybe.
[19:35:02] <seanw> thanks for example.
[19:35:31] <bremner> not sure if that's actually your problem, it would be useful to know.
[19:35:34] <michaellan> bremner: thanks!
[19:35:44] <bremner> yw
[19:35:57] <michaellan> Also, homebrew didn't seem to install the manpages for notmuch-*, how could I install those manually? or did I do something wrong
[19:36:48] <bremner> I vaguely remember someone commenting that building the docs on macs was hard. I don't know the details though (and of course there are several mac package collections)
[19:37:08] <bremner> you need sphinx-doc to build the man pages.
[19:37:25] <michaellan> I do have that
[19:37:33] <michaellan> but i will take a deeper look, thank you
