[00:52:42] <sd> 08<a​wlnx> How would you rate chef vs ansible?
[01:00:05] <Cl0udNinja> I like chef more because you can pretty easily write ruby code along with your recipes, whereas with ansible, you're stuck in yaml land. chef doesnt have its own secrets storage, where ansible does, via vault. I havent had to look for ansible, but chef had -tons- of public recipes and such that were easy to grab and modified. ansible supports a ton of stuff with existing plugins/modules. AWX is nicer than chef management, though I wasnt 
[01:00:05] <Cl0udNinja> really ever in chef management, I just used it for chef storage stuff

[18:15:10] <PublicWiFi> he's got a dope voice actually lol
[18:15:12] <gibby> I said talent

[18:15:56] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> felda I use to work for a company that did installed audio in airports and train stations. We have a real human named Grant that does all of our non-TTS stuff.
[18:15:58] <PublicWiFi> did he abandon his dream of voice acting?

[20:45:40] <frostybrew> I've drank so much caffeine already this morning
[20:45:47] <vinrock> boof a redbull
[20:45:48] <sd> 09<Q​uasky> I had a 401k from my last job for only a few months, just took the cash payout with HEAVY tax rather than fussing with the transpher
[20:46:28] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I'm hoping they can transfer it electronically rather than cutting me a check.
[20:46:30] <frostybrew> Quick question - is anyone running TheLounge on a VPS?
[20:46:36] <sintax> yeah
[20:46:46] <frostybrew> How do you like it?
[20:46:55] <frostybrew> Thinking I might give it a go
[20:46:56] <sintax> TheLounge? It's nice. 
[20:47:02] <sintax> Just open a webpage and there it is
[20:47:05] <sintax> it's like running a znc
[20:47:11] <sintax> always connected. 
[20:47:15] <frostybrew> Right now I'm running a weechat relay on a VPS
[20:47:26] <frostybrew> But it's using nothing in terms of resources lol
[20:47:36] <csws> frostybrew, it's a nodejs app which runs a webserver and also maintains the connection
[20:47:36] <sintax> no, it's pretty light. 
[20:47:40] <csws> so it's kinda webchat and znc in one
[20:47:42] <csws> but you can hook it up to znc
[20:47:58] <sd> 02<s​ebastian> it's definitely a fuckin monday
[20:48:12] <csws> it's using ~200 MB of RAM on my box
[20:48:28] <frostybrew> It helps that there's an app made for TheLounge use on iOS.
[20:49:00] <fritzwastaken> im running an AWS free instance and weechat
[20:49:03] <fritzwastaken> I just ssh to it
[20:49:05] <frostybrew> Well, *allegedly*
[20:49:16] <fritzwastaken> super simple
[20:49:40] <vinrock> oh
[20:49:42] <vinrock> i like that idea
[20:49:56] <vinrock> i didnt irc or a year and a half just because i got rid of my laptop and didnt buy a new one
[20:50:06] <fritzwastaken> lol
[20:50:18] <frostybrew> fritzwastaken: Why not just run headless and connect using glowing-bear?
[20:50:23] <sd> 13<C​olour> AWS free for IRC hahahaaa
[20:50:29] <sd> 13<C​olour> Amazing
[20:50:32] <thegodsquirrel> znc on a EC2 instance is like $5 a month
[20:50:37] <vinrock> im totaly diggin that idea heh
[20:50:46] <thegodsquirrel> After the free year
[20:51:07] <frostybrew> I got my VPS for $2 a month. 1CPU/1GB, 30GB SSD.
[20:51:15] <fritzwastaken> frostybrew: a lot of companies block chat sites
[20:51:19] <sintax> ovh has cheap vps's
[20:51:39] <fritzwastaken> I didnt want to install a client, and I didnt want a web based client
[20:51:45] <fritzwastaken> SSH is lightweight, and everywhere
[20:51:54] * sintax ssh's in to fritzwastaken
[20:52:01] <fritzwastaken> me.ow

[20:53:17] <frostybrew> fritzwastaken: Glowing bear literally just mirrors what weechat does on the server tbh
