[15:37:51] <gerikson> 21:35 <sircmpwn> working on coordinated martian time for this lang
[15:38:00] <gerikson> priorities...
[16:06:12] <Brekkjern> Their priorities are just alien to us :P
[16:21:15] <gwozniak> So I'm working on an honest-to-goodness proof for something at work
[16:22:05] <gwozniak> I came up with an algorithm and I'm trying to prove whether it is optimal or not.  Suspecting it won't be, but still
[16:22:13] <gwozniak> Haven't done this since grad school
[16:33:44] <epilys> sounds exciting
[16:47:38] <gwozniak> The general form of the problem is NP-hard, but I may have enough constraints on it to be able to show that the solution is optimal and polynomial.  Kind of fun, yeah.
[16:50:02] <gwozniak> The optimality proof would be a nice touch.  Not necessary, but would be cool

[16:54:09] <edm> they may be a fever dream but i recall a few years ago seeing tpope doing a cover of billy joel's 'we didn't start the fire' but about vim, or something
[16:54:25] <edm> if i've not gone mad, does anyone else recall this and know where the video is?
[17:13:02] <gwozniak> I don't remember ever seeing that
[17:13:17] <gwozniak> That doesn't say much, though
[18:01:40] <gwozniak> So as I thought, the proof of optimality for this algorithm is not gonna happen, but proof that the result will be as good or better than the original state is obtainable

[19:57:33] <gwozniak> Fog is finally moving out of here.  It hung around for almost 2 days.  I've never seen that before around here.
[19:57:57] <indigo> Climate change
[19:58:01] <gwozniak> I can see the fog cloud out over the lake.  Kind of neat.
[19:59:44] <gwozniak> OMG, the issue about long compile times that has been open for nearly 7 months has finally been closed
[20:00:38] <indigo> Won‚Äôt fix??
[20:01:17] <gwozniak> Fixed by figuring out some network thing that should have been discovered ages ago
[20:01:46] <gwozniak> It has to do with the licensing stuff for our compiler, which I don't like, but it's there and we have to deal with it
[20:11:59] <epilys> Wait, the license was causing long compile times? :p
[20:13:20] <gwozniak> Yes.  It was doing some weird network thing
[20:13:24] <gwozniak> Don't ask
[20:13:38] <gwozniak> I really hate that code

[21:12:19] <indigo> How've you been, Brekkjern
[21:12:37] <Brekkjern> Right now, slightly cold and a bit damp from the sleet...
[21:36:15] <skyl4rk> there is a license server for the compiler maybe/
[21:36:23] <skyl4rk> s/\//?/
[21:56:19] <gwozniak> skyl4rk: yup.  The compiler I work on uses a license mechanism to get access to various features (disabled in development, of course)
[21:57:42] <cb> XL compilers are similar
[21:57:54] <epilys> I get the motivation, but sounds like a bad thing for all involved
[21:58:01] <gwozniak> cb: yup
[21:58:05] <cb> that's why i use gcc :)
[21:58:25] <gwozniak> epilys: it's wouldn't be so bad if it was designed better, but it's not
[21:59:00] <gwozniak> What's funny is that the optimization features you need for is are the ones some (many?) customers are reluctant to even use
[21:59:15] <gwozniak> s/is are/it are/
[21:59:33] <epilys> I'm up for hire if your lead want's to rewrite that
[21:59:42] <epilys> I will use ethereum smart contracts /s
[22:00:03] <gwozniak> Our team has nothing to do with it, actually.  It's someone else's job
[22:00:47] <epilys> So if a customer has no internet connection they can't compile anything?
[22:01:06] <gwozniak> No, you can buy licenses that don't need a network connection
[22:01:38] <gwozniak> And the "free" version doesn't care about it
[22:01:52] <skyl4rk> 5 licenses and 50 devs, you have a license server on the local network or something like that
[22:01:53] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[22:02:11] <skyl4rk> because not every dev is going to be compiling at the same time
[22:02:18] <gwozniak> skyl4rk: yeah, that's the idea
[22:02:40] <gwozniak> We have that kind of limitation with the simulator we use
[22:02:49] <skyl4rk> asic?
[22:02:52] <gwozniak> qemu doesn't cut it, I'm afraid
[22:03:29] <gwozniak> It *could* cut it, if someone would let me work on it ;)
[22:03:50] <epilys> Ideally the pricing/license should be reworked to make technical sense as well.
[22:03:55] <gwozniak> skyl4rk: asic simulator?
[22:04:27] <epilys> an asic simulator is basically a turing machine
[22:04:38] <gwozniak> We need something that can simulate the CPU and memory layout stuff
[22:04:59] <skyl4rk> since you mentioned simulators in context of software with license servers I wondered if that was the domain you are working with
[22:05:36] <gwozniak> We need a good Arm and MIPS simulator for all the various configurations they support
[22:05:42] <gwozniak> Arm has a lot
[22:05:57] <gwozniak> The simulator from Arm is hella expensive
[22:06:56] <skyl4rk> can imagine
[22:06:56] <epilys> Is having a dedicated dev on it cheaper?
[22:07:21] <gwozniak> We don't use the one from Arm, and it's cheaper
[22:07:59] <gwozniak> Besides, qemu currently can't run the tests we need, so if we put a dev on it, it would cost more with no results for a while
[22:10:16] <epilys> well these internal projects are invisible costs because you don't exactly see how much you lose/gain on paper
[22:10:31] <gwozniak> qemu has rather light support for Cortex-M, and it does so by supporting two specific hardware devices (last I checked)
[22:11:05] <gwozniak> Doing the qemu thing is something I'm starting to push for a bit
[22:11:08] <epilys> it's mostly sponsored by cloud providers, so it makes sense
[22:11:45] <gwozniak> I'm sure my employer does not want support in qemu for their devices
[22:11:59] <epilys> upstream you mean?
[22:12:31] <gwozniak> Yes
[22:12:53] <gwozniak> If it could be incorporated into their IDE, then maybe
[22:15:41] <epilys> the guy who maintains CXL in QEMU for intel https://www.computeexpresslink.org is a meli (my email client) user and he told me getting it upstream was difficult and they gave up

[22:16:42] <gwozniak> It's nice that the test team wrote a decent bug report, but the scripts to recreate the issue are all hardcoded with absolute paths

[22:42:47] <skyl4rk> heard of the name, and read a few pages on it, haven't tried it out

[22:46:58] <gwozniak> Again, not saying much :)
[23:06:29] <skyl4rk> I figure it's a competitor to libsodium, possibly a little bit closer to nacl in some respects
