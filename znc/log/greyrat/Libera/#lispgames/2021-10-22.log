[00:39:37] <technomancy> weird how the autumn ones are consistently smaller than the spring ones
[00:45:24] <Icefoz> dto: On the topic of a game where people can load their own songs by specifying a BPM... there are algorithms to detect BPM from music automatically.
[00:45:56] <dto> yeah i have access to two of them, Soundstretch and Mixxx. it isn't perfect but should work fine for dance type music as this game is
[00:45:59] <dto> how are you Icefoz ?
[00:46:13] <Icefoz> Miserable but doing better.
[00:46:43] <dto> :( how come? 
[00:47:32] <Icefoz> I have a long and ongoing feud with my brain chemistry.  :)  Minor bipolar disorder, more or less.
[00:48:40] <dto> ah i see. i sympathize sir. i wish u get better soon :)
[00:49:18] <Icefoz> The brain chemistry has been winning the last couple weeks but I always come out on top in the end.  Just annoying for it to happen in the middle of a game jam!
[00:49:18] <dto> i'm thinking of how to merge dance pad control / beat oriented movement/firing with my most popular/innovative game mechanic, which was the color matching of 2x0ng
[00:49:20] <dto> and i think i can do it
[00:49:40] <Icefoz> ooooo.  I look forward to the result.  I love rhythm games.
[00:49:42] <dto> oh i see. well let us know if there is anything we can do to help.
[00:49:53] <dto> i don't think it'll be anywhere near playable by end of jam, but i'll try
[00:49:56] <dto> when does it end btw? 
[00:50:06] <dto> 72 hours
[00:50:08] <dto> hmm
[00:51:25] <Icefoz> Thanks, just saying that helps a lot.
[00:51:48] <Icefoz> I think I'll manage to have something playable, but certainly not as much gameplay as I wanted.
[00:52:10] <Icefoz> If I get the basics sorted out decently well I can always add more levels later though.
[00:52:58] <technomancy> wait 72 hours?
[00:53:13] <technomancy> for some reason I kept thinking "yeah sunday. that's like ... super far off"
[00:53:18] <Icefoz> 78 for me, the itch.io site seems to go off your own local time.

[04:03:38] <dto> hi Pixel_Outlaw 
[04:04:07] <dto> so it's official . i'm rebooting 2x0ng as a rhythm game with the same unique color matching mechanics and bouncing ball, but with all-new graphics and redesigned worlds
[04:04:14] <dto> playable with gamepad or dancepad
[04:04:44] <dto> i'll be working with a company to license dance music for the game
[04:05:25] <dto> the new name will probably be something like Danceball
[04:06:42] <Pixel_Outlaw> Great news dto!
[04:06:53] <dto> thanks Pixel_Outlaw ! how you been? LTNS
[04:07:32] <Pixel_Outlaw> Well I quit the management job after 4 years of misery and landed a Clojure job that is currently going to be a huge learning curve.
[04:07:50] <dto> oh wow. well best wishes on the new thing! how is clojure? 
[04:08:23] <Pixel_Outlaw> It's an interesting dialect of Lisp. I miss named defaulted keyword arguments. 
[04:08:52] <Pixel_Outlaw> far as I can tell they mostly just use variable arity to dispatch one of a handful of functions.
[04:09:37] <Pixel_Outlaw> It's probably the most heavy-handed Functionally biased Lisp we have.
[04:11:40] <dto> can you do object orientation? 
[04:12:01] <dto> btw my game project may involve some Scheme code, though not at runtime
[04:12:02] <Pixel_Outlaw> I think they have a notion of objects.
[04:12:12] <dto> probably maps 1-1 to java classes i bet
[04:12:57] <Pixel_Outlaw> technomancy can probably answer :)\
[04:13:06] <Pixel_Outlaw> I think he's a clojure guru if memory serves.
[04:13:53] <dto> what turns me off is the mixing of []()
[04:13:57] <Pixel_Outlaw> Unless our technomancy is not this technomancy https://github.com/technomancy
[04:14:01] <dto> i tried that in CL. it doesn't make any sense. 
[04:14:09] <dto> pretty sure it's the same technomancy
[04:14:30] <Pixel_Outlaw> Well they also have maps {:name "Peter" :age 24}
[04:14:47] <Pixel_Outlaw> They turn out to be handy but it is a bit ugly as a Lisp construct.
[04:15:02] <dto> what happens when you want to build a map as lists
[04:15:19] <dto> do you have to build (:name "Peter" :age 24) then call {}-ify on that
[04:15:25] <Pixel_Outlaw> There is an into form I believe.
[04:15:52] <dto> ah.
[04:16:00] <Pixel_Outlaw> (hashmap ) I believe is a sexp that builds them.
[04:16:11] <Pixel_Outlaw> But the literal uses {}
[04:16:26] <Pixel_Outlaw> [] is for arrays.
[04:19:43] <dto> i see
[04:20:03] <dto> so arguments to functions are arrays not lists? 
[04:20:11] <dto> i mean, the args are in an array not a list? 
[04:21:14] <Pixel_Outlaw> Correct, they are arrays. (let [my-symbol my-value my-symbol2 my-value2] ... )
[04:21:22] <Pixel_Outlaw> Let and cond have less parens.
[04:21:39] <Pixel_Outlaw> The cond is weaker now because clauses MUST be condition value pairs.
[04:22:13] <Pixel_Outlaw> You don't get the luxury of a multi statement in cond unless you use their DO construct which is NOT the same DO from other lisps. It's more like begin or progn.
[04:22:42] <dto> hmm.

[04:23:03] <Pixel_Outlaw> Yeah, they have this fixation with key/value stuff in their syntax to make less parens.
[04:23:18] <dto> would you consider it a win overall? 
[04:23:30] <Pixel_Outlaw> It's a Lisp and employment.
[04:23:31] <Pixel_Outlaw> Yes.

[12:20:28] <TMA> you can write perfectly good Java code in Clojure, if you want Java flavored object orientation. you'll miss the good parts of Clojure though. Like restricting yourself to PROG and SETQ in common lisp.

[14:57:13] <dto> ohh nice. 
[14:59:33] <dto> do you know of a way to preview spritesheet animations in gimp? 
[15:01:07] <dto> besides just cutting and pasting each animation as layers
[15:01:12] <dto> in a new document
[15:02:05] <dthompson> dto: I don't.  if you find a way, I'd love to know.
[15:02:22] <dthompson> I have never found a sprite editing program that I like more than gimp, even though it has nice features like that.
[15:02:34] <dto> i mean, my engine already supports spritesheet animations, so i guess i could just get this mismash of code working
[15:02:36] <dto> :)
[15:02:38] <dto> ok cool
[15:02:59] <dthompson> what I end up doing is setting up the animation inside my game, which watches the asset files for changes and reloads them automatically.
[15:03:04] <dthompson> so I have a live preview that way
[15:03:25] <dthompson> just a little clunkier because I have to export the file each time
[15:03:53] <dthompson> none of my sprites are animated right now. if I have time I'll do 2-frame animations or something

[15:11:00] <dthompson> those look good
[15:11:04] <dthompson> they have a nice pulse to them
[15:11:33] <dto> thanks! :)
[15:13:36] <dto> contrapunctus: 3d is so hard. it requires.... math
[15:14:42] <contrapunctus> dto: might just be the thing to motivate me to study it ^^'
[15:14:52] <dto> oh okay!
[15:15:18] <dto> i mean, i understand the basic concepts of computer graphics and coordinate systems. I got an A-minus in linear algebra. it was a Summer course and it was fucking HOT in that building
[15:15:41] <dto> i even got an A in Computability theory and discrete math. however. i actually suck at math.
[15:17:36] <dthompson> it's just so much easier to make games that *feel* good in 2d than 3d.
[15:17:48] <dthompson> so much more work to make things not look janky and weird in 3d
[15:17:54] <dto> dthompson: i've decided to go with monochrome white sprites on a transparent background for the spritesheet, and use vertex coloring to color all main objects dynamically. however, visual effects may use *gasp* vector graphics 
[15:18:15] <dto> i agree dthompson 
[15:18:16] <dthompson> sounds cool :)
[15:18:22] <dto> the standards for 3d games are so impossibly high now too
[15:18:48] <dthompson> well you definitely can't go by those standards. the ps1-style games that are popular on itch.io are a good example of indie 3d done right.
[15:18:58] <dto> oh i'm glad to hear such exists
[15:19:10] <dto> my friend and i had plans to make one. that are on the back burner
[15:19:18] <dthompson> low poly, not trying to be photo-realistic
[15:19:48] <dthompson> so stylized 3d is very much possible for one person, it's still harder than sticking to 2d
[15:20:46] <dthompson> I've done a lot of work on the 3d aspect of my game library in recent months.  working with 3d is a good way to improve pretty much everything about how you do rendering.
[15:21:11] <dthompson> I've greatly improved all of my rendering code and my knowledge of shaders.
[15:23:26] <contrapunctus> dto: I couldn't even claim all that. I haven't studied math since school.
[15:31:05] <dto> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/PdO8PbIY/robo2.gif
[15:31:29] <dto> that's cool dthompson i'll have to pick your brain sometimes
[15:31:31] <dto> sometime*
[15:31:40] <dto> maybe you could implement something that looks like Rez.
[15:31:44] <dto> or Lumines
[15:33:22] <dto> contrapunctus: well perhaps it will be a fun element of learning in the process of gamedev

[16:21:54] <dthompson> dto: I can beat it reliably. sometimes I lose a life.
[16:22:10] <dthompson> in bullet hell games the secret is sometimes to move very little.
[16:22:23] <dthompson> and realize that the player's hitbox is *tiny* compared to the sprite
[16:22:25] <dto> maybe i should have used the other attack more
[16:23:13] <dthompson> using the other attack at the start of the battle is a good way to quickly take off a lot of health
[16:23:34] <dthompson> in the current build there are 2 flowers that spawn just before the boss appears.
[16:24:34] <dthompson> if you grab those then you can reduce the length of the fight.
[16:24:40] <dthompson> otherwise you've gotta just endure!
[16:25:42] <dthompson> I've played the whole thing through enough times to know that any part that feels difficult can be completed without taking a single hit using simple tactics.
[16:27:37] <dto> very cool. always best to play the hell out of it yeah
[16:27:45] <dto> maybe i'll burn calories playtesting Danceball!
[16:28:00] <dto> can't wait to check out the finished version of your new game. 
[16:30:02] <dthompson> likewise!
[16:30:12] <dthompson> oh dang, time for work.
[16:30:29] <dthompson> only got one sprite animated.
[16:35:27] <dto> ok dthompson take care! have a good day. 
[16:36:53] <dthompson> I'll be lurking here. just not coding.

[18:55:28] <ln43> Hi all
[18:56:13] <thrig> `(good day ,pronoun)
[18:57:26] <thrig> err, ,honorific? naming variables is hard
[18:57:37] <ln43> What's up ?
[18:57:45] <thrig> a coffee shop roof
[18:59:11] <ln43> i like cofee - and for exaple java jive (ink spots)
[19:00:04] <ln43> yes modestly for me cofee and pizza or pasta forever... even if nowdays i'm eating rice and kebab too often expecially at lunch time
[19:00:23] <ln43> but fortunately few days and i will be back in my beloved nation 
[19:00:41] <ln43> few more
[19:06:48] <technomancy> dto: I've never used CLOS but I haven't used inheritance since like 2008 and I haven't once ever run into a situation where it felt like the right solution to the problem
[19:07:14] <technomancy> encapsulation is great! polymorphism can occasionally be useful but it's a terrible default. inheritance is ... well, I'm glad to be rid of it.
[19:08:01] <technomancy> message passing is really awesome in some situations but a lot of people don't consider it to be part of OOP despite the person who coined the term "OOP" saying it was the main point.
[19:08:13] <technomancy> my point is I'd rather than talk about "OOP" I'd rather talk about the pros and cons of actual specific features which have concrete definitions.
[19:08:29] <technomancy> *rather not talk about "OOP"
[19:08:45] <Icefoz> Inheritance feels like one of those things that is actually *too* powerful, a lot of the time
[19:08:53] <ln43> yes message passing as a form of dispatching maybe or not ?
[19:21:57] *** Joins: peterhil (~peterhil@mobile-access-2e846e-36.dhcp.inet.fi)
[19:29:21] <technomancy> ln43: it's a form of dispatching yeah
[19:30:27] *** Quits: ln43 (~ln43@user/ln43) (Quit: Connection closed)
[19:32:55] <Icefoz> Isn't message passing basically the same as dynamic dispatch, or are there nuances I'm missing?
[19:34:22] <technomancy> Icefoz: it has to do with who's responsible for resolving the message. message-passing means it's up to the receiver while other styles of OOP are more like "the caller reaches into a bucket of functions and rummages around for the one they want and calls it"
[19:35:02] <technomancy> the latter can be done statically or dynamically
[19:35:53] <technomancy> *who's responsible for resolving the *method* geez
[19:40:40] <Icefoz> hmmmm, so with message passing there's potentially another layer of indirection?
[19:41:35] <technomancy> async message passing is basically synonymous with the actor model, if that helps
[19:43:07] <Icefoz> Everything becomes Erlang sooner or later...  :thonk:
[19:43:23] <Icefoz> Ok, thank you.
[19:43:48] <thrig> not everything needs to be Erlang though
[19:43:58] <Icefoz> heresy!  /s
[19:44:31] <technomancy> languages can have a little Erlang, as a treat.
[19:44:39] <thrig> it was amusing to seed node leak memory and die printing in a loop
[19:44:46] <thrig> s/seed/see
[19:44:57] <Icefoz> if something doesn't eventually become Erlang, Lisp or Forth, then how important can it really be?  :D
[19:45:11] <technomancy> seriously tho sometimes I feel like there's an equivalent of Greenspun's Tenth Law for any sufficiently complex kubernetes deploy implementing a half-baked, buggy version of Erlang
[19:45:20] <technomancy> it's real bad
[19:46:05] <Icefoz> still could be better.  I remember reading through a bunch of the Erlang remote node stuff and going "oh wow this is actually *really hard* to do right, even in Erlang."
[19:46:37] <technomancy> distributed pattern-matched traces straight into your local repl tho
[19:46:39] * technomancy drools a bit
[19:48:40] <technomancy> but yeah, distributed systems design is inherently difficult and no language can magically make it all easy. but many don't even try.
[19:49:19] <thrig> wait what things can be slow, corrupted, or never return at all??
[19:49:31] <technomancy> https://p.hagelb.org/great-tragedy.gif
[19:50:08] <thrig> ... and then AWS fell over and then they added checksums to packets ...
[19:50:40] <thrig> iirc that was due to a packet showing up, twice

[20:26:08] <dto> technomancy: i do feel like my view is influenced by games where classes and inheritance are often a decent match (modulo language support) for families of objects with related behaviors.
