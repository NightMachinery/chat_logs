[05:04:03] <euouae> ghostbuster, with the fuzzer? Sorry, what do you mean?
[05:04:14] <ghostbuster> euouae: yeah, packet-level fuzzing I guess is novel?
[05:06:24] <euouae> I don't know, is that how they discovered it?
[05:06:35] <euouae> Or is that how they maximized the amplification?
[05:06:53] <euouae> I don't know how novel it is -- I think it's novel. Generally, the older programming languages have bad unit testing
[05:07:05] <euouae> and fuzzing techniques are harder to check because stuff is not 'plug and play'
[05:07:41] <euouae> but in Haskell for example there's something called 'hedgehog' which is an amazing unit testing framework that has a lot of that fuzzing stuff available as I understand it. But it's hard to inter-op with a C program, for example. I don't think that has been done. It could be cool.
[05:08:13] <euouae> If every C program had sufficient unit testing with fuzzers and randomizers, a lot of this stuff would be easier to discover, maybe?

[05:34:28] <Hash> When we used to live in small communities, small bands, tribes, evolving out of the jungle, we were in small tight knit groups and communities

[05:35:41] <Hash> Fast forward a few thousand years and in the digital age of information and we have global communities, people from all over the world who don't necessarily have to deal with one another on a daily basis

[07:41:11] <Hash> You know what's funny, i went through the whole website and I still have no idea what exactly privoxy does
[07:41:28] <Hash> Just, 'enhances privacy'...
[07:42:23] <sam_> Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.
[07:42:27] <Hash> Sure.
[07:42:29] <sam_> it seems pretty clear
[07:42:36] <Hash> I have no idea what exactly it actually does.

[15:37:37] <Descartes> I used a script to log all my Freenode chats, so all my Freenode conversations get automatically logged and archived in compressed logs
[15:38:11] <ajak> so some bits of those compressed logs looked similar to some HackTool?
[15:39:02] <Descartes> The script was used on my Chat client, Chatzilla, and when I was scanning for malware I discovered that some of the logs have a trojan generic script
[15:40:29] <Descartes> But I ignored them until now.  The last Kaspersky scan only found one freenode log file with a trojan, and it looks like Kaspersky may have deleted it already after the scan
[15:41:04] <ajak> this sounds like a false positive to me
[15:41:07] <Descartes> Because I requested it to be removed by Kaspersky
[15:42:21] <Descartes> It wouldn't matter if I lost the log anyway, because the #freenode channel is mostly useless, especially over the last couple years, and I lost my Freenode account, anyway

[15:47:09] <Descartes> It is associated with HackTool.Win32.KMSAuto.bu

[23:33:28] <Fieldy> i forget what i did to turn off malware defender in a win 10 vm for malware analytics. it was a huge pain in the ass though, including forcing some dns records to be bogus ips. they really don't want that shit off.

[23:53:22] <tatsumaru> hey guys, i hate smartphones and sold mine a long time ago, but now my bank won't allow me to verify debit card transactions with a simple SMS anymore and wants me to install an app to authenticate them, i really don't want to buy a smartphone just for this shit so I was wondering if there's a workaround of some sort?
[23:53:50] <operational> aside from walking into a branch?

[23:54:35] <operational> there is likely an exception like that
[23:54:42] <tatsumaru> yeah, that kind of defeats the purpose of having a card
[23:55:02] <operational> oh you'd have to do it every time
[23:55:15] <lts> Get a less zoomer bank
[23:55:26] <operational> have you talked to the bank about this?
[23:55:33] <operational> surely there are excptions for luddites
[23:55:37] <MadCamel> yeah change banks, I guess. text messages cost them money. an app doesn't. so they chose to use an app.
[23:55:55] <tatsumaru> well I will look into other banks
[23:55:57] <MadCamel> I'm sure you could disable this type of account security but that's no good
[23:56:05] <MadCamel> talk to the bank tho
[23:56:10] <tatsumaru> yeah I will

[23:57:06] <operational> decent info there
[23:57:20] <tatsumaru> i know there's a browser plugin which emulates google auth app, so I was hoping there was something similar like that
[23:57:22] *** Joins: tesseract (~tesseract@user/tesseract)
[23:57:47] <operational> emulation might work but i'm gonna assume their app would somehow detect it not being a phone
