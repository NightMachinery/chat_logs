[00:25:16] <nobyk> How many fly facts are we at now?
[00:25:17] <vinrock> its a forbes article so idk
[00:25:19] <signalblue> lol
[00:25:24] <vinrock> since its paywalled
[00:25:25] <signalblue> !flyfact
[00:25:25] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Unlike other insects that have two pairs of wings, house fly has only one pair of membranous wings. Second pair of wings is reduced and looks like a pair of miniature drumsticks. This pair of wings (known as halters) is used for balancing during the flying process.
[00:25:28] <signalblue> !flyfact
[00:25:28] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: The first recorded use of flies in a criminal investigation was in 13th-century China. By studying the fly population and their larval stages at a crime scene, these buzzing creatures help forensic scientists estimate the time of death. The fly species most helpful in forensic investigations include house flies, blow flies, and flesh flies.
[00:25:28] <signalblue> !flyfact
[00:25:28] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Ever wondered why it’s so difficult to swat a fly? Well, it’s pretty much down to their quick reaction times and their agility. House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.
[00:25:28] <signalblue> !flyfact
[00:25:28] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Thats right, house flies can see behind them and it’s all to do with their amazing eyes! Unlike human beings, house flies have compound eyes. These intricate eyes provided them with nearly a 360-degree field of view, which allows them to see behind themselves. Unlike ours, the eyes of a house fly dont move. Being able to see in all directions allows them to navigate while also being on the lookout for danger.
[00:25:28] <signalblue> !flyfact
[00:25:29] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies live on a liquid diet! Yes, thats correct. Flies tend to live off a diet based on liquids. Why? Well, that’s just how they are built. See, they lack the mouthparts needed to chew food, so instead, they have to drink it.
[00:25:29] <signalblue> !flyfact
[00:25:29] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Like butterflies, flies can taste food using their feet! This is all down to taste receptors (chemonsensilla) being located on their lower legs and feet. When a fly lands on a tasty meal, which can be anything from animal feces to your lunch, they will often wander around to give their next meal a good taste before consuming it.
[00:25:29] <signalblue> !flyfact
[00:25:29] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies like to eat manure, which is animal poop, or old garbage. Some of the germs from these materials can stay on their feet or mouth parts. When a fly lands on your food, those germs get on your food. Super disgusting!

[02:20:08] <rpifan> yea

[02:24:03] <DrZak> coz basically the commies transitioned straight into business which is now run by their kids
[02:24:05] <Activ8> forget about the future of the network rpifan document the current one and find out what’s been paid for.  That’s a starting point
[02:25:03] <DrZak> all 10 most rich companies/funds/holdings are run by the children of the commies educated in russian college where half the student body ended at kgb

[02:50:09] <Jay-Ros> or are you needing to make a different subnet so there's a clearly defined ingress point to the VPN subnet

[02:59:03] <mistiry> but thats not a requirement
[03:00:01] <Jay-Ros> yeah we've got a .71/24 on site A, and .72.0/24 on site B
[03:00:52] <Jay-Ros> adding another server to site A, he tried to split the DHCP in half on the new machine so .71.1-124 is on one server and .71.125-255 is on the second (or whatever)
[03:01:20] <Jay-Ros> but I figured internally it'd need to be configured like a vxlan on a switch, looks like 'ethernet bridging' is the term for it
[03:02:00] <Jay-Ros> sounds like a messy thing which can be handled by a device designed for it, i.e. .73.0/24 advertised on the switches (the deployment of the vpn subnet is documented so it's easy for him)

[03:11:58] <Jay-Ros> he's got plenty of doco on the network configuration and bgp/ospf modifications on the vlans on those sites, so they're just playbooks without a learning curve
[03:13:03] <Jay-Ros> easier than getting him to work out how to run a bridged subnet on a private internal subnet on those two devices (which will undoubtedly kick off a stink with 'unmanaged configuration' on the SCVMM console on the hosts

[04:39:31] <xe0n> The rationale for this recommendation is that SQL issues I/O in units of Extents.  Since SQL will be running I/O in 64 KB chunks, there's little point in subdividing the file system further than that (especially since the SQL data should not be commingled with other data on the same partition).
[04:39:37] <xe0n> Extents are the basic unit in which space is managed. An extent is eight physically contiguous pages, or 64 KB.

[05:40:49] <a1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[05:40:50] <a1> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
[05:40:50] <a1> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally
[05:40:50] <a1> used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!
[05:41:00] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, WSL. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free app in the Microsoft Store and part of a fully functioning Windows system made useful by the Windows OS, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS 
[05:41:00] <d1> as defined by POSIX. 
[05:41:00] <d1> Many computer users run a modified version of the WSL system every day, without realizing it.

[05:41:00] <d1> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the app: the program in the system that wastes the machine's resources to limit the other programs that you run. The app is an optional part of an operating system, but useless by itself, 
[05:41:00] <d1> it can only function in the context of a complete Windows operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Windows operating system: the whole system is basically Windows with Linux added, or WSL. All the so-called "Linux" apps are really flavors of WSL.

[05:41:20] <arlion> What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.
[05:41:20] <arlion> I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.
[05:41:20] <arlion> You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just wi
[05:41:22] <arlion> th my bare hands.
[05:41:24] <arlion> Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.
[05:41:26] <arlion> But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

[10:15:35] <SirSceptalot> folding at home?

[10:15:42] <SirSceptalot> oh
[10:15:46] <Hunterkll> heh
[10:15:49] <Hunterkll> my dell's is 180W
[10:15:49] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:15:51] <DrZak> how do you power a notebook with 3080 with 90w  adapter
[10:15:56] <DrZak> ea even 120 or 180w
[10:16:06] <DrZak> if it runs on full it has to eat more
[10:16:07] <Hunterkll> lower clock/count/etc 
[10:16:16] <DrZak> i mean i have 750w and i am worried it might not be enuff
[10:16:26] <DrZak> and some of those notebooks have pretty fat cpus
[10:16:39] <DrZak> do they have mroe powerful bricks?
[10:16:44] <DrZak> gotta take a look at my zbook
[10:16:45] <Hunterkll> well
[10:16:47] <Hunterkll> keep in mind
[10:16:55] <Hunterkll> your also using a lot more power for other shit in a full size unit
[10:17:07] <DrZak> 150w
[10:17:24] <DrZak> oh? mobo has a few Ws
[10:17:26] <Hunterkll> but I mean
[10:17:31] <DrZak> pretty much doesnt have anything else :D
[10:17:37] <Hunterkll> the 1660 Ti in my dell is rated for 80W power usage total max 
[10:18:19] <Hunterkll> and a 3080 in a laptop will range from apparently 80 to 150 watts usage
[10:18:22] <Hunterkll> maxed out
[10:19:02] <DrZak> ok so
[10:19:05] <Hunterkll> MSI GS66 laptop apparently hit.... 157W power consumption under full load
[10:19:08] <Hunterkll> that is, maxing out CPU and GPU

[10:20:02] <DrZak> and it has a 250w brick

[10:20:15] *** Joins: TurkeyGibby (sid95320@waterproofcloak/gibby)
[10:22:01] <Hunterkll> well let's see
[10:22:07] <Hunterkll> previous gen with the 10th gen intel and 2080 super 
[10:22:28] <Hunterkll> was drawing about 68W playing witcher 3 in max performance wiwth 30% screen brightness apparently
[10:22:30] <Hunterkll> on battery 
[10:22:44] <DrZak> ooooooooooh now i see
[10:22:48] <Hunterkll> obviously, plugged in, it'll draw a lot more
[10:22:51] <Hunterkll> since it has more power to grab
[10:22:58] <Hunterkll> and that's without the 120hz screen
[10:23:04] <DrZak> so, that i9 is 45w thing, though i havent found its max power consumption about it
[10:23:19] <DrZak> but Notebook 3080 has two options, an 80w and 155w version
[10:23:21] <Hunterkll> DrZak: the CPU and GPU are "cut down" lower power versions - lower voltages, lower clock speeds, etc
[10:23:33] <DrZak> so basically its crap and has nothing to do with 'real' 3080
[10:23:36] <Hunterkll> but yea, you can get in scenarios where you'll be draining battery when plugged in on some models 
[10:23:39] <Hunterkll> well, it is a real 3080 
[10:23:43] <Hunterkll> just downchecked a bit
[10:23:46] <DrZak> yea
[10:23:51] <Hunterkll> same actual chips, iirc
[10:23:57] <Hunterkll> just binned/set differently out of the factory
[10:24:05] <DrZak> ok NOW i am not dumb anymore!!
[10:24:13] <Hunterkll> i recall with the 10 series nVidia basically said they axed mobile-only skus for the most part
[10:24:20] <Hunterkll> so you get the same shit, just configured differently
[10:24:43] <Hunterkll> which, of course, on some systems you can fuck with that and bring it up to full bore, but .... might want a cooling pad or two :P
[10:25:24] <DrZak> :))
[10:25:55] <Hunterkll> but apparently, the 3080 mobile spin is like 40% slower than desktop out of the box :P
[10:26:11] <Hunterkll> mainly based on clocks/power draw
[10:26:16] <Hunterkll> as to why that is, i mean
[10:26:56] <Hunterkll> but the power ratings for the 2080 mobile was 150W .... and is the same for the 3080 (maximum configuration, that is) 
[10:26:56] <csws> 1 week later finally HP sends me a battery!
[10:27:11] <csws> it's like extracting teeth with them
[10:27:31] <Hunterkll> DrZak: and you know the desktop GPUs are 320W for the 3080, vs 225W for the 2080 
[10:27:36] <Hunterkll> so you can see where the cuts come from 
[10:27:44] <Hunterkll> basically, it's throttled down to fit the cooling profile/power profile 
[10:28:01] <DrZak> hmm 
[10:28:46] <Hunterkll> DrZak: and it is widely adjustable... at least by the vendor... https://www.wepc.com/news/acer-laptop-gpu-tgp-upgrade/
[10:28:48] <Hunterkll> as you can see here
[10:29:00] <Hunterkll> Acer released a firmware update tht cranked one of their model's TDP/TGP from 85W to 100W 
[10:29:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:29:05] <Hunterkll> that'd be a nice performance boost
[10:29:21] <DrZak> yea
[10:29:30] <DrZak> 100 is rounder than 85, must be better
[10:29:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:29:45] <Hunterkll> 15W more power, higher clocks, etc 
[10:29:45] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:29:54] <Hunterkll> "Nvidia have pushed for laptop manufacturers to clearly list the TGP of their graphics cards when marketing their products so consumers do not feel they have been mis sold the product."
[10:29:56] <Hunterkll> yea that'd be nice

[10:31:03] <DrZak> now some poor teenager thinks he has in his pocket rocket a big boy gfx
[10:31:11] <Hunterkll> like, that 3080 in the same power profile may only be ~1-2% "faster" then a 2080 model previously
[10:31:14] <Hunterkll> unless you have the 4K screen
[10:31:19] <Hunterkll> now it's suddenly like 25% faster 
[10:31:22] <Hunterkll> in the same power profile
[10:31:24] <DrZak> mhm
[10:31:27] <Hunterkll> because of the newer generation/rendering shit/etc
[10:31:45] <DrZak> i think they should've labeled it like -3080 L!

[10:32:05] <DrZak> meh, is sorted, im happy

[10:36:54] <Hunterkll> instead of relying on that one heat pipe 
[10:37:16] <DrZak> no he's got to hope the tape doesnt melt
[10:37:35] <Hunterkll> kapton tape won't
[10:37:35] <Hunterkll> lol

[10:38:10] <Hunterkll> dockable liquid cooled laptop
[10:38:29] <Hunterkll> dock is basically just larger cooling/res/radiator 
[10:38:34] <DrZak> hmmm
[10:39:09] <Hunterkll> lol it came with a wheelie case
[10:39:40] <Hunterkll> https://thehypedgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/luggage-ASUS-ROG-GX700-opened.jpeg
[10:39:45] <Hunterkll> a locking combo one even
[10:39:47] <DrZak> it might be more reliable, if the laptop vs dock were having back to back heat exchangers, thus no pipes
[10:39:50] <Hunterkll> that's ap parently how it came when you bought it 
[10:39:53] <DrZak> less efficient
[10:40:14] <DrZak> but less trouble

[10:41:03] <DrZak> wow
[10:41:12] <Hunterkll> shame they never did anything past those
[10:41:14] <DrZak> and a lovely 18,4" screen
[10:41:27] <Hunterkll> DrZak: i mean, it comes with a literal luggage case and backpack to transport it around
[10:41:29] <Hunterkll> so lol
[10:41:50] <Hunterkll> huh
[10:42:02] <Hunterkll> Asus has been using liquid metal thermal paste on their ROG systems for the past year or two 
[10:42:05] <DrZak> in theory you could use one of the mini-itx cubes from corsair
[10:42:10] <Hunterkll> since they were shipping 10th gen intel systems
[10:42:12] <DrZak> and a 15" oled display
[10:42:14] <DrZak> or 17"
[10:42:18] <DrZak> in a case
[10:42:37] <DrZak> but yea, that would have a battery
[10:44:02] <Hunterkll> DrZak: i think you mean 'built in UPS'
[10:44:20] <Hunterkll> I've seen a lot of field server type "laptops" that talk about how their built in UPS is rated for runtime
[10:44:22] <Hunterkll> not laptop battery :P
[10:44:30] <DrZak> heh
[10:44:34] <DrZak> yea makes sense

[12:31:42] <SirSceptalot> but he's just silently working, and so am I

[12:56:50] <Hunterkll> wwwwwwi find it weird, but a lot of those countries also still have per-text charges and shit like that
[12:57:13] <lancehead> Here we usually just get a limited amount of texts per month 
[12:57:22] <lancehead> I can text 120 messages/month 
[12:57:26] <SirSceptalot> We still have that in the cheapest monthlies
[12:58:01] <Hunterkll> i'm not sure that even exists here anymore except in like, 'free' plans
[12:58:13] <Hunterkll> like we have some plans that are legit free but like 100 mins / mo and shit 
[12:58:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:58:22] <SirSceptalot> one provider has a €6/mo where sms is €0.10
[12:58:36] <SirSceptalot> for €12/mo it's unlimited
[12:58:37] <lancehead> I get 120 mins of calling a month as well 
[12:58:44] <Hunterkll> https://www.freedompop.com/
[12:59:12] <lancehead> But I have unlimited data so I don't really need call time/sms
[12:59:41] <lancehead> And I'm paying my phone off through my subscription so I wanna keep it cheap :p 
[12:59:44] <Hunterkll> the free plan is wifi calling only, 10 SMS a month, (unlimited imessage/RCS over wifi), and 25MB LTE data 
[12:59:45] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:59:59] <lancehead> Jesus that's atrocious 
[13:00:13] <Hunterkll> 250 minutes, unlimited wifi calling, unlimited texts, and 1GB LTE data is $2.99 first month, $15/mo after that
[13:00:20] <lancehead> Even for a free plan that's atrocious 
[13:00:42] <lancehead> Imagine being stranded in the middle of nowhere and having 10 texts to explain where you are and find someone to pick you up 
[13:00:48] <lancehead> And after that you're just fucked LMAO 
[13:00:59] <Hunterkll> oh well if you go over it'll automatically upgrade / add on a 30 day package of the next tier
[13:01:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:01:18] <Hunterkll> you have to have a valid payment card on the account even for the free plan
[13:01:21] <Hunterkll> If you use more than 25 MBs in a 30-day cycle, we will automatically upgrade you with  500MB of LTE data (good for 30 days from the date of upgrade) for only $8! After that, additional LTE data can be added starting from just $4.
[13:01:30] <lancehead> Ahhhh okay 
[13:01:42] <Hunterkll> etc
[13:02:19] <Hunterkll> lol yea okay
[13:02:23] <Hunterkll> it actually includes 10 cellular voice minutes
[13:02:25] <Hunterkll> in the free plan
[13:02:26] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:03:16] <lancehead> Lmao 
[13:03:17] <Hunterkll> lancehead: in fact, it used to be they had data-only sim cards ONLY, and you had to use their app for calls/texts, since it went over their network data-only
[13:03:23] <Hunterkll> so they could avoid paying carrier fees, etc
[13:03:26] <Hunterkll> and only pay data 
[13:03:34] <lancehead> That's pretty smart actually 
[13:03:48] <Hunterkll> they added native cellular voice/text like a year or two ago
[13:03:57] <lancehead> And sounds like a better deal than what you just sent imo 
[13:04:20] <lancehead> Ahh our building has a metal roof and it's raining 
[13:04:24] <lancehead> Calming noises 
[13:04:24] <Hunterkll> yea but
[13:04:35] <Hunterkll> it was like 100 minutes of voice period and like 20 texts or something and still like 50MB of data
[13:04:43] <Hunterkll> this one you get unlimited calling if you're on wifi using the same number
[13:04:58] <Hunterkll> so you can catch the oh-shit emergency call but get far more calling time on the new free
[13:05:10] <lancehead> Hmm true 
[13:05:26] <Hunterkll> and if you're texting other iOS or android users (depending on what you're using) then it's still like texting, just since it's iMessage or RCS it goes over as "data" on wifi 
[13:05:37] <xe0n> imessage +++

[13:05:44] <xe0n> blue bubbles > green bubbles

[13:05:59] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:06:30] <lancehead> Jeez. I pay around 50 for unlimited data, 120 call mins, 100 texts and paying off my phone 
[13:06:58] <lancehead> Tbf my actual plan itself is only like 20 out of that, the other 30 is me paying off my phone monthly 
[13:07:00] <Hunterkll> well, primarily I have two lines which is about $70/mo per line, plus devices / insurance / addons, and a $10/mo watch line as well
[13:07:01] <xe0n> i pay around $50 for unlimited talk, text, 50gb data lol!
[13:07:07] <xe0n> and im usually on wifi ;x
[13:07:08] <xe0n> lol
[13:07:21] <Hunterkll> yea i get like $30/mo total off my bill if i have been not using data on my lines lol

[13:15:13] <Activ8> I don't use any credit cards so I'm not sure of the state of play SirSceptalot
[13:15:15] <Hunterkll> lancehead: well, phones you can drop in water are a relatively new thing in terms of being widespread
[13:15:24] <Hunterkll> though were rather common in some countries back then
[13:15:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:15:33] <rpifan> lancehead, well how do you know its healthy if u dont know your Bodyfat
[13:15:49] <Hunterkll> DoCoMo makes a lot of fascinating handsets, we've had their reps over here at conventions doing data gathering/polling/demos before of some of their designs

[13:16:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:17:03] <Hunterkll> Activ8: it goes out of support before the previous LTSC does :P
[13:17:10] <lancehead> rpifan, i'll calculate it on the toilet at work for you in just a second alright 
[13:17:17] <Activ8> they making their lives easier because there's no shit on the os ;)

[13:17:19] <Hunterkll> (and still won't run photoshop)
[13:17:28] <Activ8> it does I run it trust me lol
[13:17:39] * Hunterkll flips on an eye patch 
[13:17:49] <Hunterkll> good luck with full GPU acceleration and plugin compatibility 
[13:17:55] <Activ8> it does run that as well lol
[13:18:11] <Hunterkll> uhuh
[13:18:22] <Activ8> full GPU acceleration is part of the new 21H2 for LTSC lol
[13:18:33] <Hunterkll> it's also in the pre vious LTSC releases
[13:18:40] <Hunterkll> i'm not talking about GPU acceleration not w orking in general ....
[13:18:47] <Activ8> I'm just teasing you and poking you I know I get a reaction lol
[13:18:49] <Hunterkll> i'm talking about a specific application and missing APIs/support structures 
[13:19:00] <Activ8> get to work
[13:19:06] <Hunterkll> which caused us to conclusively demonstrate that "no, we're not deploying it to you guys, it literally causes shit to crash and not work" :P
[13:19:26] <Activ8> it's fine for home personal use it's great
[13:19:32] <Activ8> anyway 
[13:19:44] <Hunterkll> I give it less than a year before i'll have games that won't function on it :D
[13:20:01] <Hunterkll> but wtf
[13:20:02] <Activ8> I don't run games on it as such so I'm safe
[13:20:04] <Hunterkll> i want this phone 
[13:20:10] <Activ8> which phone
[13:20:18] <Hunterkll> Kyocera KY-01L
[13:20:29] <Hunterkll> E-Ink display based android phone in a rather unique formfactor
[13:20:41] <Activ8> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roL6t3eZzY0
[13:20:53] <Hunterkll> yea
[13:21:13] <Hunterkll> designed to fit in a business card holder
[13:21:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:21:18] <Activ8> ewwwwwwwww
[13:21:29] <Activ8> but nice that it goes in a business card holder
[13:21:35] <Activ8> should be cheap to fix one of those!
[13:22:38] <Hunterkll> 380 mAh battery lol
[13:23:15] <Hunterkll> but it's a simple feature phone with a web browser, nothing to muck up, just does shit, simple
[13:23:47] <Hunterkll> 100 hrs standby, 110 minutes talk, drop a few books on it and bob's your uncle
[13:24:02] <Activ8> you wouldn't want to browse the web with e ink that would be terrible
[13:24:29] <Hunterkll> i mean, it's there and has it if you need to look something up, but no big deal... not the primary point
[13:24:44] <Activ8> not bad for a small phone though
[13:24:55] <Hunterkll> it's also pitched at a market where business cards are still super common
[13:25:22] <Hunterkll> and it's less than $300 all said and done for what it is
[13:25:55] <Hunterkll> the idea being it supplements a regular phone you'd also have anyway, replacing business cards etc 
[13:26:30] <Hunterkll> that's also obvoius by the fact that you can't install apps on it, not even sideloaded apk stuff 
[13:26:35] <Hunterkll> quite a specialized feature phone device
[13:27:42] <Hunterkll> wonder if they still make the OLED keypad ones 
[13:28:56] <Hunterkll> i remember... god, was it ... otakon 2015? we had NTT booth there, they were showing off a flip phone with an OLED keypad (change buttons into whatever based on app), international TV tuner shit with digital support, 1080p 120hz display, etc
[13:29:43] <Hunterkll> no android or iOS in sight : D
[13:30:02] *** Joins: Oddly (~sacr@mailserver.rshs.nl)
[13:32:27] <Activ8> indeed
[13:32:48] <Hunterkll> though i think they had one or two android based models but you'd never tell by using them
[13:33:03] <Hunterkll> now all the sharp and kyo flip phones are android based, but still not exactly possible to tell unless you dig in

[13:35:06] <SirSceptalot> morning
[13:35:09] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, metal. Lost PLA casting.
[13:35:18] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: he wants to make a glock 7 
[13:35:21] <yuken> lol
[13:36:23] <Hunterkll> you know
[13:36:27] <teh_f4ll3n> you don't need a kiln for lost metal.(unless you want to temper it afterwards which you can do in an old gas oven)
[13:36:28] <Hunterkll> we almost banned the glock 7 nationwide 
[13:36:38] <Hunterkll> was a huge controversy 
[13:36:45] <teh_f4ll3n> you need a furnace
[13:36:58] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, I need to hit 1500-2000 degrees.
[13:37:06] <Hunterkll> according to several newspapers even gaddafi was trying to acquire them for his country 
[13:38:43] <Hunterkll> oh wait i forgot we did ban them

[13:39:24] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, yes.
[13:39:27] <Hunterkll> what a useless law
[13:39:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:39:29] <teh_f4ll3n> way too hot for Aluminium
[13:39:32] <yuken> Bronze & copper, and aluminium.
[13:39:33] <Hunterkll> >The NRA agreed not to oppose the Act because it did not affect any existing guns.
[13:39:37] <yuken> Are the things I want to be able to cast.

[13:40:15] <Activ8> my playlist for today
[13:40:28] <sd> 06<s​tig124> 1st day as Head of IT, it feels good to finally have a say in decisions
[13:40:42] <teh_f4ll3n> ok bronze makes sense
[13:40:49] <Activ8> head of IT and you still might not have the power to decision make 
[13:40:56] <Activ8> all depends on the budget and who is controlling you ha
[13:41:05] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, I want to try making some frames and receivers out of bronze, for the maymays.
[13:41:09] <teh_f4ll3n> but for melting, you're probably better off with a propane furnace
[13:41:22] <Activ8> I was head of IT in a tech company and I was still told on what I can and can't do
[13:41:33] <Hunterkll> heh no shit
[13:41:38] <Hunterkll> you're there to deliver what the business needs
[13:41:48] <Activ8> no shit sherlock!
[13:41:48] <Hunterkll> well, what they ask for really 
[13:41:51] <lancehead> Hmm, have any of you ever implemented an IDS/IPS? If so, how does that work exactly? Are they software based or devices, how do you get/configure one etc 
[13:42:04] <lancehead> Hey look Hunterkll, I got better at asking questions!
[13:42:05] <Hunterkll> if that includes, say 
[13:42:06] <Activ8> nope I was TOLD what I can and can't do so I ended up just taking the money and doing as I was told
[13:42:22] <Hunterkll> "We need 50 high end CAD workstations from origin pc" 
[13:42:24] <Hunterkll> then so be it
[13:42:25] <Hunterkll> :P
[13:42:27] <Activ8> I was the noddy dog in the back of a car
[13:42:29] <Hunterkll> besides the customer's paying for them anyway
[13:42:30] <Hunterkll> :D
[13:42:37] <Activ8> took the money and run
[13:42:46] <teh_f4ll3n> cabanos, anyone?
[13:42:49] <Hunterkll> i'm still amused we have origin PC images in our sccm env
[13:43:03] <Hunterkll> https://www.originpc.com/
[13:43:29] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, if all I want is a cheap, backyard foundry for small amounts of lost PLA casting, you got any recommendations there?
[13:43:38] <teh_f4ll3n> I'll never trust system integrators
[13:44:00] <lancehead> wtf, my larynx clicks when I swallow 
[13:44:00] <Hunterkll> their governemnt/business support team actually is pretty good
[13:44:08] <sd> 06<s​tig124> Where I work, Head of IT is the highest that you can get without getting into multi-site on-call workforces that doesn't deal with local policies. And as sites are extremely different in how they deal with IT, we're pretty much independant (except in InfoSec, but that's doable)
[13:44:20] <teh_f4ll3n> yuken, a lot of people make their own out of an old steel cylinder lined with refractory cement
[13:44:32] <yuken> I was thinking firebricks would work for what I want.
[13:44:40] <yuken> Or a fire extinguisher tube.
[13:44:43] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: they're also like half the price of HP's Z workstations
[13:44:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:45:02] <Activ8> always nice when you get a little power to order new workstations
[13:45:12] <Activ8> we got a delivery of 6000 systems one week was great
[13:45:22] <Activ8> 5 van loads on pallets
[13:45:35] <yuken> Hunterkll, how the hell do you enjoy getting blackout drunk btw? I am never touching alcohol again.
[13:45:48] <Activ8> so you keep saying yuken lol
[13:45:49] <Hunterkll> mostly by not blacking out for the most part
[13:45:57] <yuken> hell no Activ8.
[13:46:00] <teh_f4ll3n> at least not until the next weekend, eh yuken?
[13:46:02] <yuken> I am never touching it again.
[13:46:07] <Hunterkll> loooool
[13:46:08] <Activ8> Hunterkll doesn't really drink he just says he does 
[13:46:16] <Activ8> just to tease all the proper alcoholics
[13:46:18] <yuken> don'tchu dare laugh Hunterkll, never again.

[13:46:56] <Activ8> blackout is alright as long as you wake up from it
[13:47:02] <Activ8> it's when you don't wake up you got to worry LOL

[13:58:37] <lancehead> If so, any good? 
[13:58:39] <lancehead> No lol 
[13:58:52] <lancehead> IDS that started life as a packet sniffer, hence the name 
[13:59:12] <Activ8> oh you meant an app I see I see
[13:59:21] <Activ8> it's just like any other packet sniffer it works
[13:59:32] <Activ8> I've used it but prefer wireshark
[13:59:43] <Hunterkll> Activ8: russia? this is how you get in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBhpqVyEFbg
[14:00:05] <lancehead> You can also use it as a NIDS, that's the functionality I'm looking for Activ8
[14:00:23] <Activ8> ha ha ha
[14:00:37] <Activ8> never heard of NIDS so I can't answer that
[14:00:45] <Hunterkll> he means an IDS
[14:00:49] <teh_f4ll3n> Hunterkll, I saw these guys live 3 weeks ago
[14:00:50] <Hunterkll> with 'network' in front of it
[14:00:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:00:59] <lancehead> ye ^ 
[14:01:07] <lancehead> apples, pears, potato, potato, tomato, tomato 
[14:01:12] <lancehead> more fruits and vegetables 
[14:01:14] <Hunterkll> so basically a term that makes ya look stupid using
[14:01:14] <lancehead> same same 
[14:01:14] <Hunterkll> :D
[14:01:22] <Hunterkll> Activ8: but yea watch that video to the end
[14:01:22] <lancehead> I am stupid, what's your point?
[14:01:23] <Hunterkll> it's great
[14:02:07] <Activ8> awesome 450/600 of our clients upgraded successfully to the latest rmm client.  the other 150 were switched off :) nice.
[14:02:20] <lancehead> Hey that's a 75% success rate 
[14:02:22] <lancehead> Not bad I'd say 
[14:02:44] <SirSceptalot> More importantly, none failed due to a config error or similar
[14:03:09] <Activ8> not bad out of the 25%, 15% were mobile devices and the other 10% was desktops 
[14:03:13] <SirSceptalot> Or due to "Error: something went wrong"
[14:03:15] <lancehead> Suricata does also look pretty sexy... 
[14:03:25] <Activ8> non failed due to config it was pure because they where off
[14:03:36] <Activ8> so really that's 100% success rate across the on devices not bad
[14:04:50] <Hunterkll> sometimes things in this game make a lot of sense, sometimes they don't
[14:04:56] <Hunterkll> "go punch bombs a lot with your brass knuckles"
[14:06:14] <Activ8> I'm going to archive and backup my mailbox today so I get a fresh mailbox, everything over 2 months old.
[14:06:33] <Activ8> it's sittingn at around 23gb so hopefully can get rid of at least 18gb
[14:07:13] <SirSceptalot> what's wrong with in-place archive?
[14:07:14] <Activ8> sitting*
[14:07:28] <Activ8> I could do that yes
[14:07:32] <lancehead> I'll give you my in-place archive
[14:07:34] <lancehead> ;)
[14:08:20] <Activ8> why would you do that 
[14:08:57] <lancehead> That was meant to be a joke 
[14:08:58] <Activ8> on a good note my service desk has 2 tickets left to complete and it's a clean service desk! both on hold waiting for customer
[14:09:04] <lancehead> Woo! 
[14:09:17] <lancehead> On a neutral note, jesus fucking christ I wanna go back to sleep 
[14:09:58] <Activ8> My endorphins are moving today I feel a lot more alert than normal, had only 1 cup of tea and nothing else
[14:10:25] <Activ8> or should I say serotonin not endorphins lol
[14:10:49] <lancehead> Ah yes, my estrogen is also working 
[14:11:12] <Activ8> LOL
[14:11:17] <Activ8> are you female?
[14:11:22] <lancehead> No 
[14:11:26] <lancehead> Men have estrogen too you know 
[14:11:49] <Activ8> they do? are you sure lol
[14:12:05] <Activ8> https://www.healthline.com/health/estrogen-in-men
[14:12:08] <Activ8> so they do
[14:12:09] <lancehead> Estrogen is a sex hormone found in both males and females, although females have higher estrogen levels than males do. The ovaries, testes, fat cells, and adrenal glands produce estrogen. It is important for female puberty and controlling the menstrual cycle. Estrogen is also important for the male reproductive system.
[14:12:10] <lancehead> Yep
[14:12:22] * Hunterkll remands Activ8 back to basic biology
[14:12:25] <Activ8> hmm
[14:12:38] <Activ8> Hunterkll you just Google stuff you nah nowt
[14:12:39] <Activ8> lol
[14:12:51] <Hunterkll> fun fact
[14:12:56] <Hunterkll> the clitoris is just an undeveloped penis 
[14:12:57] <Activ8> I thought male hormones were Testosterone not Estrogen
[14:12:59] <Hunterkll> think about that next time
[14:13:03] <Hunterkll> it's a mix of both lol
[14:13:04] <Activ8> I already knew that
[14:13:22] <Activ8> licky licky clity clity - mini penis ewww lol
[14:14:24] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i mean, but you have to think maybe like this - there's "normal" ranges of testosterone for female athletes to detect doping/hormone supplements/etc for cheating, and for there to be a normal range that means there has to be some to start with 
[14:14:29] <Hunterkll> so why wouldn't hte collary be true?
[14:15:36] <Activ8> I don't think like that I'm not really into that stuff
[14:15:53] <Hunterkll> bah this shit hits major news cycles every few years
[14:15:55] <teh_f4ll3n> WTF? I go away for 10 minutes and Activ8 is already blowing someone
[14:15:55] <Hunterkll> olympics drama 
[14:15:59] <lancehead> It's okay, I'm also not really into males 
[14:16:34] <Hunterkll> not something to be into, just something you're subjected to because olympics drama :P
[14:16:48] <lancehead> I was responding to Activ8
[14:17:00] <Hunterkll> i was still continuing my statement to him as well
[14:17:00] <Activ8> I don't watch olympic drama
[14:17:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:17:12] <lancehead> Communication is hard
[14:17:18] <Hunterkll> only if you're not thinking
[14:17:24] <Hunterkll> Activ8: like i said, subjected to, not som ething you seek out
[14:17:27] <lancehead> Thinking is hard
[14:17:33] <lancehead> I'm hard 
[14:18:01] <Activ8> don't say that to rpifan lancehead
[14:18:02] <Activ8> lol
[14:18:08] <lancehead> rpifan: I'm hard
[14:18:16] <Activ8> he's not here
[14:18:25] <Activ8> atm but I think he said he was working from home last night

[14:18:37] <lancehead> And he is indeed working from home 
[14:19:09] <Activ8> there we go, mailbox is archived.  Email is now down to 2.4gb

[14:21:32] <Activ8> who woke him up
[14:21:36] <Hunterkll> just disconnect the RDP or lock the screen
[14:21:47] <Hunterkll> log off closes out your login session and obviously closes all your programs,just like it does on any other OS 
[14:21:56] <lancehead> His hard penis senses tingled @ Activ8 
[14:22:01] <Activ8> you use something like thelounge chat client and install it on a server so when you d/c the session stays open :P
[14:22:07] <Activ8> lancehead watch your DMs
[14:22:13] <Activ8> haha
[14:22:17] <lancehead> lol 
[14:22:19] <rpifan> ah
[14:22:23] <teh_f4ll3n> rpifan, Start -> Power -> Disconnect

[14:22:50] <lancehead> It is 
[14:22:55] <Activ8> rpifan lancehead says he wants to blow you

[14:23:32] <Hunterkll> rpifan: yea it is 
[14:23:38] <Hunterkll> any open programs stay open and working
[14:23:43] <Hunterkll> rpifan: but maybe your system is going to sleep on you?
[14:23:58] <rpifan> hmm could be
[14:24:00] <Activ8> or maybe rpifan is going to sleep on the system
[14:24:01] <rpifan> should look that up
[14:24:04] <rpifan> also that Activ8 
[14:24:09] <rpifan> i bought bread but i should have gotten more
[14:24:10] <teh_f4ll3n> or there's a inactive session timeout like I have set on my terminal server
[14:24:14] <teh_f4ll3n> an*
[14:24:21] <Activ8> I had an egg sandwich this morning
[14:24:24] <rpifan> the bakery on the corner of my house is not so nice at the one under the office even tho they are the same company
[14:24:27] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: i suspect it's an unmanaged home PC :P
[14:24:35] <rpifan> well we arent using rdp or anything
[14:24:42] <rpifan> well its connected to the azure AD Hunterkll 
[14:24:45] <teh_f4ll3n> you disconnect for more than 30m, kiss your session bye-bye
[14:24:46] <teh_f4ll3n> :D
[14:24:48] <Hunterkll> rpifan: but yea check your power settings, by default windows is set to sleep even on mains power
[14:24:56] <Activ8> oh nice! fresh stuff all the time then rpifan
[14:24:59] <Hunterkll> after like 20 minutes
[14:25:07] <Activ8> Hunterkll stop telling him let him google that shit
[14:25:45] <teh_f4ll3n> lol Activ8 you have to be aware of something to google it
[14:26:18] <Hunterkll> yea presented symptoms wouldn't provide anything remotely relevant if it is the system just going into sleep :P
[14:26:28] <Activ8> ha
[14:26:29] <lancehead> Nahh teh_f4ll3n it's easy 
[14:26:36] <lancehead> "how make IRC stay on???111!?!?!!!" 
[14:26:49] <Hunterkll> "free irc proxy"
[14:26:55] <Hunterkll> fucking dragonfleas...
[14:27:01] <teh_f4ll3n> If Google was a guy
[14:27:22] <teh_f4ll3n> "make IRC not disconnect how?"
[14:27:33] <Hunterkll> "fuck off"
[14:27:34] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:27:37] <Activ8> no fuck off
[14:27:39] <Hunterkll> Activ8: you ever hear the dragonfleas story?
[14:27:51] <Activ8> I haven't but I have a feeling you are about to tell me
[14:27:55] <Hunterkll> well
[14:27:58] <Hunterkll> the tl;dr is basically
[14:28:17] <Hunterkll> i'm join.me'd into his work's shit, with like 5 other people watching while i'm fixing his exchange for him 
[14:28:19] <teh_f4ll3n> lol dragonfleas
[14:28:33] <Hunterkll> he pastes some dumb shit in irc client while i'm working on exchange waiting for a process to finish 
[14:28:48] <Hunterkll> gets klined, i'm finishing the step on fixing his exchange server, he sees the kline, flips out
[14:28:55] <Activ8> LOLOL
[14:28:58] <Hunterkll> and immediately yanks the mouse away from me and starts googling "FREE IRC PROXY"
[14:29:06] <lancehead> HAHAHA 
[14:29:23] <Hunterkll> I mean I also managed to delete his domain admin account too
[14:29:23] <Activ8> why on earth would he do that
[14:29:28] <Hunterkll> because he was shitposting in here
[14:29:31] <Hunterkll> :D
[14:29:34] <Activ8> lmao!
[14:29:45] <Hunterkll> i forgot about the nasty thing that disable in exchange does to AD accounts
[14:29:45] <Activ8> I hope you billed him per second
[14:29:48] <Hunterkll> pfff
[14:29:53] <Hunterkll> no billing sadly :P
[14:30:00] <Activ8> ouch
[14:30:03] <Hunterkll> it was actually fun for me because I had never touched that version of exchange before
[14:30:05] <Hunterkll> exchange 2007 
[14:30:10] <Hunterkll> and he had totally ratfucked the environment
[14:30:11] <Activ8> should have been at least a small invoice
[14:30:14] <Hunterkll> and only had an NTbackup of the mailboxes
[14:30:21] <Hunterkll> eh sometimes i enjoy fucked up challenges
[14:30:24] <Activ8> ntbackups of mailboxes what where they thinking
[14:30:26] <Hunterkll> like a completely ratfucked failed repair install 
[14:30:29] <Hunterkll> of exchange 2007
[14:30:33] <Hunterkll> on a new VM 
[14:30:44] <SirSceptalot> I don't think my "reputation" here is going to sink any lower with this... Wtf is "kline"
[14:30:44] <Activ8> nasty that is
[14:30:51] <Hunterkll> Activ8: even better? the physical server he couldn't get to power on that had their actual OG exchange install? 
[14:30:58] <Activ8> your on IRC and you don't know what KLINE is?
[14:30:58] <Hunterkll> ....
[14:31:01] <teh_f4ll3n> new VM yet exchange was already fucked?
[14:31:13] <Activ8> go into a room and paste 10000000 lines lol and watch what a kline is
[14:31:14] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: one of the ty pes of bans available on an IRC network
[14:31:25] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: no no, he set up a VM because their one exchange server was "shot"
[14:31:27] <SirSceptalot> thanks
[14:31:38] <teh_f4ll3n> http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/h-klines.html
[14:31:39] <Hunterkll> but anyway, his boss came in the morning after, and was like *fiddle fiddle* *server turns right on* 
[14:31:40] <layer8> teh_f4ll3n: URL Title for http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/h-klines.html - #Beginner - K-Lines
[14:31:42] <layer8> Title: #Beginner - K-Lines
[14:31:52] <Activ8> some people shouldn't be allowed in IT
[14:31:56] <Hunterkll> so d ragonfleas had to fuck around all night overnight after a fulld ay work and needed us to help pull his ass out of the fire
[14:31:59] <Hunterkll> then next morning before he goes home
[14:32:04] <Hunterkll> "oh yea it just turned right on"
[14:32:06] <Hunterkll> .....
[14:32:19] <teh_f4ll3n> O.o
[14:32:22] <Hunterkll> think it might have been a bunk redundant PSU or a ram stick or something
[14:32:22] <Activ8> I need to make a backup of a drive I have problem is I can only do it over USB to mirror a 500gb drive
[14:32:22] <teh_f4ll3n> -.o
[14:32:31] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: but no, he fucked up the repair install by not doing a bunch of pre-req shit 
[14:32:42] <teh_f4ll3n> makes sense
[14:32:47] <Hunterkll> repair install of exchange is putting a "new" exchange server in an existing org that has no other exchange servers and/or you're restoring backup files to
[14:32:57] <Hunterkll> very special kind of install
[14:33:04] <Hunterkll> so he made new VM, tried the repair install, it blatantly fucked up 
[14:33:09] <Hunterkll> cries in here
[14:33:18] <Activ8> what caused the requirement for a repair in the first place
[14:33:20] <Hunterkll> ii'm like "ill fuckin fix it but ive never touched exchange 2007 before" 
[14:33:29] <Hunterkll> Activ8: when you only have one exchange server and it's now "dead" seemingly
[14:33:39] <Hunterkll> and your only "backups" are the NTbackup/windows server backup of the mailboxes
[14:33:40] <Activ8> oh so he killed an exchange box
[14:33:47] <CptLuxx> haha
[14:33:49] <CptLuxx> what an idiot
[14:33:50] <Hunterkll> i forget what actually happened but for whatever reason 
[14:33:53] <Activ8> one reason to put your shit in 0365 no hardware maintenance
[14:33:55] <Hunterkll> he couldn't get the physical box back online
[14:34:14] <Hunterkll> bah, we'll be out of most of cloud shit soon enough i feel 
[14:34:16] *** Quits: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf) (Quit: ZNC 1.7.2+deb3 - https://znc.in)
[14:34:17] <Jos> exchange 2007 on bare metal
[14:34:19] <Activ8> did you manage to fix it? I hope you got a thanks for that they would have been billed a fortune
[14:34:24] <Jos> been a couple of years since i've seen that
[14:34:28] <Hunterkll> our monthly opex is more than our yearly capex these days lol
[14:34:33] <Hunterkll> Activ8: oh pff hell yea
[14:34:38] <Activ8> I hope were not out of cloud it's working fantastically so far
[14:34:40] <rpifan> Hunterkll, why were you fixing dragonfleas shit for him
[14:34:43] <Hunterkll> Activ8: see,e xchange internally.... really isn't that much different between 2007 and 2013, etc
[14:34:48] <Hunterkll> rpifan: this was years ago lol
[14:34:48] <rpifan> dont forget he stole a car from irc
[14:34:50] <Hunterkll> when he stole that car
[14:34:51] <Activ8> despite a rise I feel it's working much better
[14:35:03] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[14:35:08] <Activ8> he stole a car from IRC? what
[14:35:09] <teh_f4ll3n> I need to update zabbix... Been putting it off for ages
[14:35:12] <Hunterkll> Activ8: so even though I had nevere touched Exch 2007 before and wanted the challenge, it was really quite easy for someone who knows exchange in and out
[14:35:25] <Activ8> yeh I guess so I haven't touched exchange for a long time
[14:35:28] <Hunterkll> it was just using my jedi skills to recover pre-req installers, etc that had vanished off the internet that was the real hat trick
[14:35:41] <Hunterkll> stuff MS had taken off download sites years ago, etc
[14:35:49] <Activ8> that's the problem with linking to websites
[14:35:55] <Activ8> if they go so does your documentation
[14:36:19] <Hunterkll> eh, that's not necessarily an issue when you're dealing with current vendor supported products and/or similar product families 
[14:36:29] <Activ8> not if it's outdated stuff
[14:36:31] <SirSceptalot> LUNCH HOUR

[14:47:46] <lancehead> No I know that's what it means 
[14:47:50] <lancehead> But what's it look like in Russian lmao
[14:48:01] <teh_f4ll3n> пидорас
[14:48:07] <rpifan> go to dick? teh_f4ll3n ?
[14:48:10] <lancehead> Alright that's all the Russian I know, thank you 
[14:48:12] <rpifan> btw putin hublot
[14:48:39] <teh_f4ll3n> rpifan, "go fuck yourself" or "fuck you"
[14:48:44] <rpifan> oh and while we are here jebać pis
[14:48:47] <teh_f4ll3n> but year literally
[14:48:50] <rpifan> nice
[14:49:00] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah*
[14:49:09] <rpifan> ide looks like iść which is polish to go
[14:49:13] <rpifan> so i figured it was similar
[14:51:24] <rpifan> i really wish polish was written in cyrilic
[14:51:25] <lancehead> teh_f4ll3n: I had a Russian classmate and friend in my first two years of college, that's all he ever taught me 
[14:51:33] <rpifan> the latin alphabet system they have is stupid
[14:51:38] <rpifan> and it doesnt have a soft sign
[14:51:51] <rpifan> so you have to guess when that pi is an actual pi or just a soft p
[14:52:08] <lancehead> I feel like that'd be doable in context 
[14:52:37] <rpifan> teh_f4ll3n, ohh so apparently the first person present of iść in polish is actually  	idę so literally the same as in russian
[14:52:51] <teh_f4ll3n> the soft is implied depending on the following letter. same in Russian a lot of cases. We don't put it everywhere mostly at the end of the word
[14:52:56] <lancehead> Hell yeah, grammar!
[14:53:15] <lancehead> I love my grammar! Gonna go give her a call
[14:53:18] <rpifan> teh_f4ll3n, oh really? i thought you used the soft sign always
[14:53:24] <teh_f4ll3n> no

[14:59:19] <rpifan> by the great peter
[14:59:25] <lancehead> Yes yuken
[14:59:32] <teh_f4ll3n> yes, yuken, a filthy commie
[14:59:43] <yuken> Hey. You haven't been Commie, officially, for 30 years now
[14:59:55] <teh_f4ll3n> I was born a commie
[15:00:00] <lancehead> Unofficially, however... 
[15:00:01] <rpifan> well teh_f4ll3n loves vladimir vladimorovichs xui
[15:00:02] <yuken> Oh right, people here are old.
[15:00:08] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, I was born after Windows XP.
[15:00:16] <rpifan> chui* polish spelling
[15:00:35] <teh_f4ll3n> rpifan, I'm not you
[15:00:42] <teh_f4ll3n> you're getting confused
[15:00:44] <rpifan> lol
[15:01:44] <teh_f4ll3n> you poor confused soul

[15:02:11] <teh_f4ll3n> сам соси
[15:02:23] <rpifan> san souci?
[15:02:56] <teh_f4ll3n> loosely translated as "no u" in this context
[15:03:01] <rpifan> ah
[15:03:45] <rpifan> whats the russian verb for to suck / blowjob?
[15:04:12] <teh_f4ll3n> you said "suck dick" in Polish, so I said "no u" in Russian
[15:04:31] *** Quits: lancehead (~lancehead@user/lancehead) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:04:53] <teh_f4ll3n> соси хуй would be the equivalent of the above
[15:05:28] <rpifan> so it seems the verb is also similar to the polish one
[15:05:35] <rpifan> honestly im really fascinated by the grammar here 
[15:05:35] <teh_f4ll3n> yay! zabbix backed up, now I need to fetch the new version and unpack it. wish me luck
[15:05:35] <rpifan> lol
[15:05:43] <rpifan> hopefully ill end up learning polish and russian at the same time
[15:06:38] <rpifan> i really prefer how russian sounds in the slavic family
[15:06:44] <rpifan> its sounds much more melodic to me
[15:06:49] <CptLuxx> gay
[15:06:50] <teh_f4ll3n> you'll find A LOT of similarities between Polish and Russian, especially if you know archaic Russian words
[15:07:02] <teh_f4ll3n> a lot of those are still the same in Polish
[15:07:38] <teh_f4ll3n> my sister-in-law is Polish and I can understand her OK most of the time
[15:07:48] <rpifan> yea polish is actually the more conservative slavic language
[15:07:53] <rpifan> especially with the nasal vowels
[15:07:57] <rpifan> which everyone else has already lost
[15:08:51] <rpifan> supposedly czech is similar but in my experience i dont understand any czech at all
[15:09:05] <rpifan> then again my polish isnt really even A1 yet
[15:12:18] <teh_f4ll3n> TIL: a gross is dozen dozens
[15:12:22] <teh_f4ll3n> so 144

[17:39:51] <mjt> how long has windows XP been powering power plants though
[17:40:06] <interop_madness> probably more likely 75%
[17:41:30] <interop_madness> many people involved in the power industry, at a higher technical level, have spoken out and they always say, large scale blackouts are question of when, not if.

[17:42:40] <interop_madness> all persons dependent on medications die with 100% certainty, for instance
[17:42:51] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> So like the power system failing for extended periods of time, say months
[17:43:34] <interop_madness> failing or intentionally being disturbed from outside constantly, yes
[17:43:51] <interop_madness> but even with power grids online
[17:44:08] <interop_madness> a well crafted supply chain attack will kill a two digit figure of the population as well

[18:19:54] <mistiry> iirc it was TalkCity
[18:19:55] * sintax has a bachelor in history :)
[18:19:58] <JollyRgrs> CIS was just CS Jr. with some business classes (think "management")
[18:20:08] <sintax> and 5 more classes for my information technology associate
[18:20:11] <JollyRgrs> and CS was pure programming
[18:20:32] <JollyRgrs> i got ~4 yrs worth of college credits, but not even an AA to my name
[18:20:34] <sintax> i took c++ and html in high school
[18:21:22] <sintax> realized then i didn't wanna code 8 hours a day
[18:22:01] <JollyRgrs> wait^^^^^
[18:22:05] <JollyRgrs> me, too!

[18:22:46] <sintax> lol
[18:22:48] <JollyRgrs> then took data structures (using C)... then Advanced Data Structures... using java... and prof was like "this is Adv. Data Structures, not intro to Java, I won't be teaching you Java"
[18:22:59] <sintax> haha
[18:23:04] <JollyRgrs> even though... there was no "java" on the track for CS
[18:23:04] <sintax> but java makes the world go roun

[18:24:21] <JollyRgrs> yeah, like way to make sure your students stick with the program!
[18:24:31] <mistiry> i never took any programming courses
[18:24:33] <JollyRgrs> that's not the prof's fault though... it's the college of CS
[18:24:37] <mistiry> closest i got in college was PLC programming

In fact, you can thank midges for satisfying your chocolate craving. These tiny flies are the primary pollinators of the cacao (or cocoa) tree.
[18:26:15] <mistiry> in junior high they had fucking pascal and cobol classes
[18:26:21] <mistiry> never bothered with those
[18:26:26] <JollyRgrs> ugh... so they seem to have updated the policies on the main server I connect to
[18:26:29] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Interestingly, we had this weird CS/CEG path where the first 2 years were togather and taught the basics of computers and programing. They diverged and CEG learned EE and low level stuff while CS learned about software develpment
[18:26:30] <sintax> my dad took fortran when he went to college
[18:26:43] <JollyRgrs> it used to never time me out back to the lock screen... now it does

It asks implementers to make addresses in the prior loopback range 127.1.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 fully usable for unicast use on the Internet
[18:46:48] <technonerd> that is a wild RFC

[18:47:32] <teh_f4ll3n> this version is 5.7

[18:48:39] <arlion> Think about if ARNET were to redesignate 127.0.0.0/16 to, lets say 127.0.0./24 and hand out that those xtra ips as public ips. The chaos that would happen between hackers getting those ip's and trying localhost attacks.

[20:02:03] <teh_f4ll3n> i have console if I need to
[20:02:12] <teh_f4ll3n> not the end of the world
[20:02:18] <arlion> same reason if you restart the ssh server, you won't get kicked out
[20:02:20] <PublicWiFi> why is sssd so much easier to get running ubuntu than debian
[20:02:32] <arlion> i hate sssd with a pashion

[20:05:54] <voice06[m]> that means its break time
[20:06:36] <rpifan> Hunterkll, so if we arent gonna use on prem or online AD is there anything you recommend for MDM and such
[20:07:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> rpifan MDM? 
[20:07:26] <arlion> teh_f4ll3n: alright here you go

[23:08:29] <sintax> i wouldn't touch it.

[23:08:46] <sintax> whew
[23:08:51] <ptaav> i do think this is great experience though

[23:09:25] <ptaav> well this is coming from a tencent vps sitting in virginia.
[23:09:27] <int0x1C8> you all know damn well they aren't paying for actual IR, its a freaking church
[23:09:27] <TurkeyGibby> yeah
[23:09:35] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> yeah prob not
[23:09:40] <ptaav> they're massive, as churches go
[23:09:48] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> but if they are willing to pay an 8k ransom, fuck it
[23:09:59] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> or whatever it winds up being
[23:10:00] <TurkeyGibby> you'd be surprised what churches will pay for during an incident
[23:10:08] <ptaav> and their director was just asking for help setting up a phishing campaign
[23:10:14] <TurkeyGibby> speaking from experience on that one
[23:10:44] <int0x1C8> well I can't imagine they'd have much to lose anyway
[23:10:57] <sintax> int0x1C8: all that tax free money in accounting

[23:13:07] <TurkeyGibby> hope they have backups
[23:13:16] <TurkeyGibby> that'd be the one thing I'd want to verify in the meantime
[23:13:18] <ptaav> they do

[23:14:10] <TurkeyGibby> sintax: yes
[23:14:11] <ptaav> the incursion happened yesterday

[23:28:52] <sintax> that was my guess
[23:29:00] <sintax> was wondering how we went from ransomware to the price is right. 
[23:30:41] <ptaav> my biggest issue is i can't say for sure if i've found something

[23:31:56] <ptaav> but, i can't find anything substantial saying they've been compromised except some traffic from this chinese ip and a suspicious aspx
[23:32:18] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i was thinking about buying a kvm so i could just switch all three over to the laptop

[23:32:36] <ptaav> a hdmi switch?
[23:32:39] <Cl0udNinja> what ports are on the laptop?
[23:32:57] <sintax> @HurdyGurdyBurdy DisplayLink makes some decent stuff for a decent price that can handle 3 monitors. 
[23:33:02] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> this is hypothetical atm, I'd probably get a dock for the laptop
[23:33:16] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i'll take a look

[23:33:34] <sintax> https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/displaylink-products-list?sort_by=created
[23:34:08] <ptaav> or a usb-c dock
[23:34:27] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> that's true in general
[23:34:28] <ptaav> with multiple monitor outputs
[23:35:25] <ptaav> if it's a dell laptop, i think their newer docks support three monitors

[23:35:48] <sintax> the d6000 dock has displaylink tech and will do 3 i believe.
