[04:01:33] <hayley> Good morning everyone!
[04:04:34] <gilberth> Hello hayley!
[04:05:27] * edgar-rft wonders if there are bignum gensyms
[04:06:20] <hayley> You'd have to make 2^62 gensyms to do it "legit". Or just set *gensym-counter\*
[04:06:41] <hayley> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G-YVPtA3GQ

[04:07:07] <gilberth> edgar-rft: Sure. (setf *gensym-counter* (expt 2 1000)) works fine.

[04:07:31] <gilberth> TeX is said to be bug-free, isn't it?
[04:09:12] <gilberth> hayley: 2^29 could be suffice.
[04:09:15] * hayley  is amused her ex posted something about feeling more free with a partner that understands them. Huh, I feel more free without you.
[04:09:37] <hayley> Yeah, but you need a 32 bit system with more tag bits on fixnums.
[04:10:05] <gilberth> 32-bit software runs fine here.
[04:10:49] <gilberth> I keep that as my rented server is 32-bit.
[04:10:51] <hayley> Still 29 bit fixnums would be uncommon. SBCL and SICL use 30 or 62 bit.
[04:11:23] <gilberth> Sign?
[04:11:36] * edgar-rft now is afraid that Lisp one day generates a gensym with a bignum that is bigger than the memory of his computer
[04:11:57] <hayley> Yes, including the sign. A positive fixnum looks like 0 then 62 bits then another 0

[04:12:58] -ixelp- The More I See You (Peel Session 3) - YouTube
[04:13:02] <gilberth> I would prefer 51 bits.
[04:13:15] <edgar-rft> Let's all our numbers have zodiac signs.
[04:13:32] <gilberth> So either I messed something up or found a variant violation in TeX. Hmm.
[04:15:41] <gilberth> How the hell could I debug that?
[04:19:36] <gilberth> And 61 bits for a fixnum on a 64-bit platform would make more sense than 62.
[04:22:36] <hayley> I already said how 62 bit is what SBCL and SICL do, as there is only one tag bit for fixnums.
[04:23:00] <gilberth> That would make it 63 bits.
[04:23:22] <hayley> Well, I counted the sign bit as overhead for a gensym counter.
[04:23:36] <gilberth> 61 bits would make sense, as you then don't need to shift an index into a vector on byte-addressed machines.
[04:24:03] <gilberth> In fact this is what CCL uses.
[04:24:34] <hayley> Yeah, if you have a 32 bit machine.
[04:24:52] <hayley> And we are lucky to have MOV RAX, [RBX + RCX * 8]
[04:27:06] <gilberth> I get <https://termbin.com/9rj4> for various Lisp implementations. CLISP is the most strange.

[04:27:53] <gilberth> hayley: No, when you have a 64-bit machine. One word = 2^3 octets, 64-3 = 61.
[04:28:17] <gilberth> But as you said: When you're lucky. Does every RISC have that? I doubt so.
[04:29:15] <hayley> Nope. You have to make a derived pointer there.
[04:30:04] <gilberth> See. Perhaps this is also what MOV RAX, [RBX + RCX * 8] expands to internally.
[04:31:02] <gilberth> And it would be "* 4" with 63-bit fixnums. :-p
[04:32:05] <hayley> SBCL appears to box and unbox repeatedly on one microbenchmark.
[04:32:21] <gilberth> Anyhow, how would I debug my glitch? Is it me or Knuth who messed up?
[04:32:22] <hayley> Whereas Cleavir commits to unboxing which I like more.
[04:36:20] <gilberth> I get <https://termbin.com/8hku>
[04:37:16] <gilberth> Look! No unboxing or boxing.
[04:38:58] * hayley spots (addq ($ 8) (% save0))
[04:39:29] <hayley> Whereas SBCL still bumps a fixnum by 2 and thus produces MOV [RDX+RAX*4+1], RCX
[04:46:09] <hayley> Whoever runs the Googler interview at university is also spamming the chat room. Anything funny to post?
[04:47:10] <hayley> fuckoffgoogle.de is sadly meme-free AFAICT.
[04:53:57] <gilberth> hayley: that is the (incf i)
[04:55:01] <gilberth> ok. could I find a working TeX implementation that is not tinkered with? And could I somehow trace exactly what it does?
[04:57:47] <hayley> So, you have three tag bits on a fixnum, and one sign bit?
[04:58:06] <gilberth> Yes.
[04:58:49] <hayley> Sheesh.
[04:58:49] <gilberth> I wonder how CLISP came up with 49.
[04:59:18] <gilberth> hayley: And? Makes perfect sense to me.
[04:59:35] <hayley> Yes, but I want more fixnum bits.
[04:59:46] <gilberth> Why?

[05:00:38] <gilberth> This doesn't buy you much. The worst case is facing some 64-bit signed or unsigned data, and there 63 bits lose as much as 61 or even 64.
[05:01:20] <gilberth> I doubt you find many cases, where you process just 62 bit or 63 bit data.
[05:02:22] <gilberth> I still have no idea on how to debug this. Especially as the "source" is pretty much unreadable.
[05:03:26] <gilberth> I am at (< (ABS (SLOT (AREF MEM (+ P 6)) INT)) 1048576) tripping on field INT being undefined. What the hell is 6? Or 1048576?
[05:04:30] <gilberth> I could as well face a disassembly.
[05:04:39] <hayley> 2^20?
[05:04:52] <gilberth> What does it mean?
[05:05:38] <gilberth> There are all kinds of magic numbers in there, all defined by macros, and 6 is a slot.
[05:06:33] <gilberth> Strings are pointers into a string pool. Pointers < 256 are characters.

[07:30:44] <gilberth> Hello dave0! Could you spare a Pascal compiler?
[07:33:05] <dave0> sorry i don't have one of those :-(
[07:33:23] <gilberth> Anyhow, I give up for tonight. Perhaps I'll have some insight while I sleep.
[07:34:17] <gilberth> dave0: I have TURBO Pascal for CP/M 80, but it won't run TeX either.
[07:34:46] <dave0> sounds fast
[07:35:37] <gilberth> It was pretty fast. And was an IDE on a 64kB machine. Pretty impressive.
[07:36:28] <gilberth> I more or less grew up with that implementation. Wrote my first Lisp interpreter in it. :)
[07:37:14] <dave0> oh there's probably a msdos version
[07:37:21] <dave0> good old dos
[07:38:15] <gilberth> There is. And the later versions came with a TUI. Also Turbo C, pretty nice. When I am be bored, I'll do same style Turbo Lisp. Though there also was Turbo Prolog.
[07:48:54] <gilberth> Something is very strange. I cannot login home going via port forwarding to ssh. HTTP port forwarding is fine. OpenVPN is fine too.
[07:50:31] <gilberth> But I can ssh in via my OpenVPN. Still, this concerns me a bit. Why would ssh not talk to me coming from outside?
[07:57:58] <gilberth> What I can see though is that my router got updated and rebooted tonight by the ISP.
[08:03:56] <gilberth> *sigh* Nothing is working.
[08:20:39] <edgar-rft> At least nothing is working. I mean, after all, somebody must *do* all the work.

[09:01:53] <gilberth> p2c is brilliant. It translates "FOR K:=0 TO 9 DO DVI_FOUR(EQTB[5318+K].INT);" as "for (K = 5317; K <= 5326; K++) DVI_FOUR(EQTB[K].INT);" Yet K is of type 0..9.
[09:03:58] <hayley> It folded in the addition of 5318 into the loop?
[09:04:28] <gilberth> Yes, but the values are invalid for K, as it is of type 0..9 and p2c picks a 'char' for it.
[09:05:04] <hayley> "Server fire, may impact some services..."
[09:05:28] <hayley> Right, right. Didn't see the definition of K on the C side.

[09:45:58] <gilberth> OK. After I figured out how to disable that in p2c, it produces the exact same DVI file.

[17:23:35] <shka> muscles or joints?
[17:24:10] <hayley> Muscles?
[17:24:25] <hayley> Idk, probably a sign I should sleep.
[17:24:27] <shka> i mean your hurting arms
[17:24:40] <hayley> Yes, it's the muscles.
[17:25:02] <shka> legs fine?
[17:25:09] <hayley> Yes.

[17:28:58] * hayley wonders what could be done with an overloadable IF. Perhaps we could have it act as a select/blend on vectors.
[17:29:44] <hayley> Assuming that we don't have generalised booleans, so not #t or #f/whatever two values you like are an error usually.
[17:35:06] <Alfr> hayley, why shouldn't you have both, e.g. generalized booleans with #f for false and #t as the canonical value for true?
[17:37:21] <Alfr> "canonical value" as in the absence of other useful values.
[17:46:08] <hayley> You could, but then overloading would change the semantics of other code in unintended ways.
[17:47:01] <hayley> e.g. before (IF #*1101 a b) would evaluate to whatever a evaluates to, but after it would not.

[17:54:09] <hayley> Well, now my arm doesn't hurt, so I can write mean things. Here goes.
[17:55:53] <hayley> It's apparently a community building thing I think. But it's plain dumb to make it difficult to do things (the Unix part) in order to have a reason to make a community.
[17:56:20] <hayley> It's a moral equivalent of setting your neighbour's house on fire so you can rescue their cat, except you're also the cat.
[17:58:02] <hayley> In that regard I would also only attach the label "queer" to a maximalist, a most self-expressive program. Otherwise one is just doing self-imposed conformity all over again.

[18:07:48] <hayley> But people find being stupid in some ways to be cute. It sounds like a group pity party to me sometimes, except again the causes of pity are self-manufactured. Which is to an extent why for a while I told people it was fine to overestimate what they had achieved, since everyone was busy underestimating to write sob stories.

[18:12:10] <hayley> The same sort of self-hatred which ends up in saying "computers are a mistake" or some other bullshit. They are a meta-media, you are meant to go in and make them not a mistake rather than bitch about it. Which is another reason why I got dumped. Fun fact.
[18:18:23] <hayley> So I don't like to interact with most queer people online, cause they do act like that most of the time, and I loathe it. I'm not kidding.
[18:20:19] <hayley> As it stands, suffering with them is easier than suffering with myself, but if that changes I could probably do a pretty good techbro act. They usually think I am one already.
[18:26:46] <hayley> Right, back to Unix before I begin listing more sources of depression: duping oneself is a necessary part to enjoy forcing yourself to fit in. But fitting in like that is notably very un-queer. So the whole service is a contradiction, yes.
[18:27:27] <pjb> Stupidity could have been cute for a time (when the IQ differential was low).  But nowadays, it's really hurtful of "Mitgefühl"; they're so dumb…
[18:28:12] <hayley> Can you just skip to the part where you proclaim someone should be shot? Thanks, I don't have all night.
[18:30:20] <hayley> It's not that they have low IQ, it's that they go around saying they're dumb for no reason other than to procedurally get empathy out of the other person.
[18:34:06] <hayley> And sometimes technical naïveté seems to be encouraged for some reason or another (which is the only reason the subject of my second to last article isn't blatantly a joke from the get-go). Even still, I don't consider them to be stupid.

[23:44:18] <gilberth> Good morning #lispcafe!
[23:45:15] <selwyn> hi
[23:45:53] <gilberth> Hello selwyn!
[23:47:22] <gilberth> Plan for tonight: Make that damn trace for TeX. The p2c version at least produces the very same DVI output as I do, yet my translation trips a variant violation. I would really like to know whether that is my bug or Knuth'.
[23:50:54] <selwyn> there is flooding all over the place here
[23:51:18] <shka> selwyn: from rain?
[23:51:22] <selwyn> yes
[23:51:31] <gilberth> Oh dear! Is it bad? Are you safe?
[23:51:37] <selwyn> i am safe
[23:51:42] <selwyn> but it made our cycle ride interesting
[23:52:17] <shka> i read that in china there was some crazy rainfall 
[23:52:25] <shka> like 220mms of rain in two days
[23:53:03] <gilberth> Yes, about the same amount as in our south west.
[23:53:15] <gilberth> World is falling apart, it seems.
[23:53:17] <selwyn> https://twitter.com/R0bday/status/1419339808372142083 i was only one stop away from this
[23:54:42] <selwyn> rather surprised that i managed to get back successfully via public transport
[23:57:46] <selwyn> they say some places will have had up to 100mm today
