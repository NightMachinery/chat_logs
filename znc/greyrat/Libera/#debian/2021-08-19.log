[02:10:02] <BCMM> the behaviour i'm seeing isn't documented in the man page, so i consider that, at least, to be a bug
[02:10:54] <BCMM> (also, intuitively it feels like `apt upgrade packagename` should do the thing that `apt --only-upgrade install packagename` actually does)
[02:10:59] <PMT> I should warn you that if you go down the rabbit hole of documenting apt commands, you may never return.
[02:11:41] <BCMM> i know that `apt` is horribly undocumented, but i thought `apt-get` (which has the same "feature") was supposed to be a bit better

[03:43:57] <Blondie101010> not being able to ping the AP is unusual if the client gets an IP from DHCP

[04:00:09] <Blondie101010> too bad
[04:00:12] <R0b0t1> the issue is definitely routing and I need to look further into it Blondie101010 
[04:00:28] <R0b0t1> normally, you don't bridge the two interfaces you are routing between, in my case NAT
[04:00:30] <Blondie101010> you're pinging from what IP to what IP?
[04:00:46] <Blondie101010> that's what I meant by doing something VERY bad
[04:00:50] <R0b0t1> but hostapd has hardware acceleration for some chipsets that makes use of a bridge to (I assume) do zerocopy packet rewriting

[04:01:31] <Blondie101010> I doubt there is ANY good reason for doing that
[04:01:36] <R0b0t1> the issue is the default route in `ip route` doesn't mention br0 and instead mentions wlan0 ... I think
[04:01:40] <Blondie101010> don't be surprised you messed it up
[04:01:47] <R0b0t1> idk I followed an adafruit tutorial
[04:02:04] <R0b0t1> now I remember why I quit doing that
[04:02:28] <Blondie101010> if you want to NAT it, don't bridge it
[04:02:38] <Blondie101010> otherwise you need to put exceptions everywhere

[04:03:25] <Blondie101010> yes
[04:03:34] <Blondie101010> but you don't bridge AND NAT

[04:05:19] <R0b0t1> you should really look at that page
[04:05:22] <R0b0t1> it bridges and nats it

[04:06:59] <R0b0t1> hmm looks like you got me
[04:07:06] <R0b0t1> it blurred together with the other one I was looking at

[04:07:12] * Blondie101010 nods
[04:07:33] <Blondie101010> but note that I'm only 95% sure you want it bridged :)
[04:08:09] <Blondie101010> though the alternative seems to involve double-NATing which is not ideal
[04:09:02] <R0b0t1> yeah that's dumb

[04:09:22] <knotMez> I compiled dumb today
[04:09:25] <R0b0t1> hostapd supports that bridge mode for unrouted AP mode for some hardware and that's why it's there

[05:28:14] <knotMez> something about it couldn't create the partition?
[05:28:35] <knotMez> was weird
[05:28:49] <Hackerpcs> it's was a working bios 10.10 that was made 11 to unbootable state

[09:08:23] <xmetal> not sure if this is the place (vs the offtopic room) to ask but i have a VM (that parts not really important i guess) that was installed two weeks ago based on a Debian testing ISO ... if the sources.list (I think from the start) pointed to "bullseye" ... would doing a regular "apt update" and then an "apt upgrade" ... mean that is a "Debian Stable" install now? 
[09:08:46] <PMT> You would be running stable after upgrading, yeah.
[09:09:07] <xmetal> ah ok .. thanks ... was just curious 
[09:10:20] <bibble> Nginx from debian official repo. Unable to "apt purge nginx" as nginx-core error encountered all the time. Same that happened during the OS upgrade.
[09:10:24] <bibble> "nginx: [emerg] dlopen() "/usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_geoip_module.so" failed (/usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_geoip_module.so: undefined symbol: ngx_stream_add_variable) in /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/70-mod-stream-geoip.conf"
[09:10:59] <bibble> Commented out all modules and geoip settings in Nginx conf files, but same problem persists.
[09:11:28] <PMT> can you please paste the whole output from whatever command you try, starting from where you put in the command?
[09:11:44] <bibble> OK
[09:12:19] <PMT> Pastebin, I should have said.
[09:12:41] <PMT> That is, paste it into a website like paste.debian.net and share the link that results, not paste it directly in here. That would end poorly.
[09:15:46] <bibble> "apt purge nginx > output.txt 2>&1" https://0x0.st/-yyy.txt
[09:17:12] <bibble> That first happened during "full-upgrade", now just can't do anything with nginx
[09:17:30] <somiaj> bibble: seems you also need to purge nginx-core, since that is the package that is failing (due to it not starting correctly).
[09:17:45] <bibble> OK, will try.
[09:17:53] <somiaj> Looks like something with your ngnix setup isn't working, but before your start puring everything, did you back up your nginx configuration in /etc?
[09:17:56] *** Quits: mickey (~user@user/mickey) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[09:18:11] <somiaj> but it might be best at this time to just purge ngnix and reinstall from scratch (After backing up your configuration)

[09:19:21] <bibble> Just backedup /etc/nginx, now "apt purge nginx*"
[09:19:30] <PMT> it seems like this can happen if you have the module enabled but not one of its dependencies. https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/issues/1437
[09:19:39] <PMT> (Yes I know you're not using their packages.)
[09:21:22] <bibble> Interesting.
[09:21:56] <bibble> purge nginx* seemed to work and kept /var/www/html as not empty.
[09:22:06] <somiaj> bibble: you might also want to include libnginx* to get all modules too (again just to ensure you are starting fesh), mgiht also now that you have backedup /etc/nginx, remove that directory before reintalling, again to ensure you are starting fresh
[09:22:18] <bibble> So now "dpkg --configure -a" from sury issue thread?
[09:22:20] <somiaj> keeping /var/www/html around is probably best, since you have your site there
[09:22:36] <somiaj> at this point once you have purged everything, you should be able to just reinstall
[09:23:52] <PMT> Having purged the half-installed package, I think I would expect dpkg --configure -a to be a noop. But I could be wrong, I don't have to fix memorable dpkg breakages that often nowadays.
[09:24:01] <bibble> OK, purge nginx* removed /etc/nginx. Now done purge libnginx*
[09:24:45] <bibble> So shouldn't do dpkg configure and just try "apt install nginx"?

[09:35:12] <somiaj> (:
[09:35:32] <somiaj> sometimes it is just easier (espically during an upgrade) to just backup, purge everything and start out fresh
[09:35:50] <somiaj> vs trying to track down the actual error

[12:37:36] <PMT> I would guess the first == the third since isohybrid and the second is just a tarball of the bits that are included on top of the base disc images.
[12:38:01] <PMT> Since at a random sampling the first and third contain the same contents.
[12:39:29] <PMT> https://wiki.debian.org/Firmware covers the first two and the third is probably historical so you might be able to find it in the wiki page's history.

[14:23:34] <Khepra> SpearRaven: btw, I'm not sure but when branch revision bumps, and you basically get a newer kernel package, that's where ABI changs happen
[14:23:42] <zerowalker_w> is there some good practices on how to create a service account that's meant to be accessible by ssh with a publickey. apart from that it doesn't need any "user stuff" so to speak.
[14:23:47] <mrfb> SpearRaven: if it says 11, then probably bookworm repositories are still in the process of full migration, this takes sometime, I may be wrong anyway, maybe someone here can throw some light
[14:23:49] <Khepra> ie I'm not sure there's no ABI changes in debian revisions within a branch

[14:24:32] <SpearRaven> thanks Khepra and mrfb i thought that might be the case
[14:24:58] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: for those I use -r for useradd, and I place their home in /var/ .   I think that's purely a matter of preference

[14:27:00] <mrfb> In my opinion, for those who want to stay with more updated packages should stay on SID
[14:27:57] <mrfb> testing has this gray zone between updates and releases that I can't recommend for using it as a daily driver. But this is my opinion
[14:28:10] <rendar> can i tell apt full-upgrde to automatically keeps default files, and if it wants can stop services? so it doesn't prompt it to me, and don't stop installation

[14:33:58] <mrfb> well, it's common sense. I used to use SID until I realized that newer is overrated when I need to get things done
[14:34:43] <Khepra> I like Stable base and backport exceptions where something newer is really needed. best of both worlds.

[15:08:33] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: because typically services would have their data/homes there, /var/lib or /var/db/
[15:09:11] <Khepra> it's purely arbitrary decision on my part. to me, /home/ is for humans and clients. services are elsewhere. also fits with various selinux and apparmor policies wrt /home/
[15:10:04] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: look up hier(7) manpage, it explains historic reasons and functions of various directories on *nix
[15:11:02] <zerowalker_w> ah i see.  well it sounds logical, i like to try to follow some kind of standard, i find it a bit sad that it's a bit "random", but i am a windows user that started linux stuff some years ago so my thought pattern is probably not there yet
[15:11:11] <zerowalker_w> oh nice will do
[15:11:57] <zerowalker_w> that one was really nice, thanks
[15:15:10] <zerowalker_w> interesting, as i have started putting my own applications in /opt i now see that you should have the configs for those in /etc/opt. I don't quite get "opt = add-on packages", "usr/local = programs local to the site"
[15:15:50] <zerowalker_w> aren't all programs locally installed basically?
[15:16:01] *** Joins: polyphem (~polyphem@2a02:810d:640:776c:bd0c:a594:ef4e:c3f3)
[15:16:02] <Khepra> some of the hier(7) differentiation doesn't make much sense, esp. today when you consider that /usr was created because they ran out of disk space with early UNIX implementations
[15:16:41] <zerowalker_w> damn it, it was such a good start xd
[15:16:47] <SpearRaven> when choosing a Linux distro I tried quite a few in VM, decided Debian was the one I liked the most
[15:16:48] <Khepra> some also shun /opt thinking it's non-unixy and prefer just /usr/local/  . /usr/local/ on BSDs is where third party programs go because BSDs are typically a "whole" OS, unlike linux which is a collection of various pacakges
[15:17:24] <SpearRaven> i have xfce de and configured in a way that i suspect nobody else has
[15:17:27] <zerowalker_w> btw on the account thing, if you do "useradd -r foo" how do you give it that home directory, do you specify it with -d ?
[15:17:39] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: in the end the decision where to place stuff is arbitrary with the exception of: avoid places where package manger puts stuff.
[15:17:56] <n4dir> the third party term of BSD's offered a little bit of insight in /usr/local to me. In general to someone like me it is a bit of a miracle (opt or local or users ~/bin and what not)
[15:17:59] <Khepra> which means, use /usr/local/ or /opt/ or /srv/ ; whichever fits for you

[15:22:00] <n4dir> well, i take things very loose. But in very amateur terms in BSD there is a strict disctincion between the OS, all created by one team, and all kind of other applications. They go to /usr/local. If i recall correct even home is "local"
[15:22:29] <n4dir> in Linux the OS itself already comes from, at minimum, two teams. 
[15:22:46] <Khepra> really the important part is to avoid /usr/{s}bin/ where the package manger puts programs.   /etc/ is _suppsoed_ to be managed by the human admin or his/her automation, and yes it's typically for configuration files though sometimes "executable shell scripts" count as configuration, so the confusion is deepened.
[15:22:53] <n4dir> kernel and (again amateur) coreutils. 
[15:23:15] <zerowalker_w> ah sorry, differences between linux and bsd, to me it's "same shit" mostly to put it bluntly. I get that it's much more complicated, but i don't really see a clear distinction.

[15:26:08] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: in general:   /etc  is for configuration;  /boot is for kernel and initramfs and boot things;  /{usr/}[s]bin/ is for executable programs.  /var is for dynamic data (databases, libs, caches),   /var/log/ is a subset that explains itself,  /home/ is for (human) unix account homes;   /dev,sys,proc are system pseudofilesystems generated on each boot.  /run is for run-time dynamic tmpfs stuff,

[15:27:46] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: one difference is  Sbin is for admins,  bin is for everyone; though it may also have something to do with "availability to mount rootfs from initramfs" but that again is totally arbitrary distinction, given the existence of initramfs.
[15:28:17] <Khepra> I personally hate the distinction especially because we have $PATHs that makes it even less obvious.

[15:39:30] <zerowalker_w> thanks
[15:39:30] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: btw your earlier question, imo it's always good to ahve a password if login is allowed in any form (ie. shell ain't /bin/false or something along those lines)
[15:39:55] <BCMM> to be honest, the first paragraph makes me start to suspect that this is one of those things that's basically for comp scis
[15:40:43] <n4dir> the little i remember from debian GNU/Hurd it was also organized in a different way. Not everything, but quite a bit
[15:41:40] <BCMM> I'm curious about this Nix claim in particular: "If you forget a dependency, that you have separately installed on your machine, then the component may build and work correctly on your machine, but failing on the end user's machine."
[15:41:43] <zerowalker_w> Khepra, and does the password has to be known if you use publickey and nopasswd for sudo? (not sure what's good practice there tbh, but it feels a bit twice twice with key + pass, though i am sure it's more secure to some degree)
[15:42:25] <BCMM> is that true of Debian's build infrastructure? does it take any steps to makes sure packages don't have access to deps they didn't ask for at build time?
[15:42:44] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: those are separate issues. if you allow _ssh_ login with public key only, it's irrelevant if that acct has a password or not (unless you have UsePAM no and then you have to set a pass and unlock even for ssh pubkey login)
[15:42:55] *** Quits: bittin_ (~luna@user/bittin) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:43:48] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: then, if you want pubkey to be secure over using a pass, you must block ssh password logins entirely.    however, inside the OS, one process/agent/user can su to another account if they knew the password. so it's good idea to always use a pass even if it's a randomized something you, the human admin, won't even use

[15:44:19] <Khepra> always use == always set on accounts you create, be it for humans or services
[15:44:39] <Khepra> (unless the account has no login capabilities at all, in which case password is irrelevant)
[15:46:24] <zerowalker_w> Khepra, sorry should have stated that. SSH = only public keys, no PAM either (tried it and locked myself out, was something for making sudo not require password if you authenticated with pubkey, but was not worth it i think and just made things messy)
[15:46:58] <zerowalker_w> So it's not a bad idea to have a random password if the intention only is for ssh access anyway

[15:53:39] <mrfb> I'm not complaining
[15:53:53] <mrfb> just lazy to re-learn stuff I forgot how to use years ago
[15:54:04] <SpearRaven> hehe anything can be figured out and gotten use to
[15:54:26] <mrfb> it's complicated, as I said, I respect the way the teams do the stuff
[15:55:03] <mrfb> I understand that they prefer stay safe than sorry, but anyway, the project keeps going on, and that's what matter IMHO
[15:55:26] <SpearRaven> yeah it's all good in the end
[15:56:48] <BCMM> n4dir: to be honest even helping with the wiki has a bit of a barrier. i've had a couple of trivial things i've wanted to change, the kind of things that i'd just fix on the spot on Wikipedia. somehow, it's never quite reached the threshold where i've actually gone through with "Please contact wiki@debian.org and describe what you want to do in the wiki."
[15:57:27] <n4dir> BCMM: ah, i did a little bit, years, ago, and it kinda worked. But what you say i heard a few times now
[15:58:31] <BCMM> if i had a substantial thing to write up, like i'm actually putting a bit of time aside for it, i guess i'd probably do it? but then again, i think most people probably get in to wikis through minor edits

[15:59:21] <n4dir> #packaging and #debian-mentors, iirc
[15:59:37] <n4dir> packaging being more of "package stuff for yourself" than official
[15:59:43] <BCMM> i mean now that i'm talking about it, i'm thinking i should just go and write that email. but i don't actually have a specific edit in mind right now, so i don't really know what i'll say!
[15:59:56] <n4dir> and, of course, you could write bug-reports and attach a patch
[16:00:20] <n4dir> not trying to say: "no, no, it all is easy". Just shooting some ideas.
[16:00:49] <n4dir> also: sub-projects. What i did was "diaspora", and entering that sub-project was rather easy
[16:00:53] <BCMM> like, in the situation where i come across something super-trivial like "oh, this is outdated, that package has been renamed now", writing an email and waiting for an answer before i fix it is just not appealing
[16:01:16] <n4dir> BCMM: you don't just make an account at wiki.debian.org and edit your way?
[16:01:35] <BCMM> n4dir: that's the thing! it totally looks like you can, but at the end of the process you get this message:

[16:01:52] <n4dir> Not that much to say but: that sucks. 
[16:02:14] <n4dir> as said, i heard such, but not as detailed as you just said
[16:02:26] <BCMM> i'm going to go an actually write that email now. i'm not actually refusing to edit the wiki based on this. i'm just explaining why i haven't done it up until now.

[16:04:40] <BCMM> honestly "describe what you want to do in the wiki" might be the major blocker for me. like, i dunno, i just want to fix little problems. am i supposed to have an actual project to document in order to sign up?
[16:04:57] <n4dir> BCMM: i think i got you, and i fully agree.

[18:29:02] <dpkg> There is no "bullseye/updates" repository for security updates. To reduce confusion with <bullseye-updates> (which is for other bug fixes), security updates are distributed via the <bullseye-security> repository "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main".

[18:30:44] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades.

[21:32:33] <Na_Klar> I've got a risc-v SoC with debian riscv64 port on it. I want to use a raspberry pi audio hat on that riscv SoC. The manufaturer says that the driver for the audio hat is in the linux kernel. for the rasp, you have to configure a boot/config.txt, instead of it having a bios, to make it run. Now, my riscv SoC does not have a bios either nor a config.txt. The hat sits on the gpio's and the riscv board does power it. How could I get my d

[22:05:02] <BCMM> Na_Klar: usually, config.txt stuff like, on the pi, is just manipulating devicetree. if your risc-v system uses devicetree, you might be able to adapt it
[22:06:58] <BCMM> e.g. if you've been told to put "dtoverlay=hifiberry-digi-pro" in config.txt, that's just a reference to this file, (which would normally be installed in every raspberry pi's boot partition): https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/hifiberry-digi-pro.dtbo
[22:07:32] <BCMM> ^stuff like that, on the pi

[22:17:22] <tharkun> Good $DAY I need to perform several serialized upgrades on a couple of servers. Uninstalling postgresql will drop all the databases or is manual dumping of the cluster the appropiate way to do it?

[22:17:59] <sney> zeamp: it's packaged in systemd-sysv so it is on your system, you might be hitting the su / PATH thing that was changed in buster,
[22:18:01] <sney> !buster su
[22:18:01] <dpkg> In buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.

[23:54:22] <Peanut> Or maybe not - how different would Raspberry Pi Debian be from 'regular' Debian?
[23:54:50] <sney> raspbian is known for having several customizations that make it hard for #debian to support
[23:55:12] <sney> it's much more of a derivative than most of the SBC images, that are usually just stock debian with a funky kernel and bootloader

[23:55:55] <dpkg> Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) is a distribution <based on Debian> made specifically for the <Raspberry Pi>.  Raspbian is not Debian and it is not supported in #debian.  Please use #raspbian (or #raspberrypi) on irc.libera.chat for support.   https://www.raspbian.org/
