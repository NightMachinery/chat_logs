[14:15:03] <flatcap> morning all
[14:19:08] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[14:19:15] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:19:30] <flatcap> [devel/kill-lastkey] is looking good!
[14:19:35] * gahr doing some more work on gui/cursl_lib
[14:20:13] <flatcap> lovely
[14:34:53] <flatcap> wow! that's looking a lot tidier
[15:06:27] <gahr> next thing I want to do is, mutt_getch returns OP_TIMEOUT and OP_ABORT in its ch part, not its op part
[15:06:34] <gahr> that makes by brain hurt
[15:06:56] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/3c79124fe3e325add989f5227bc6593bde59c826/gui/curs_lib.c#L229-L230
[15:07:35] <flatcap> good :-)
[15:07:51] <gahr> I'll change that
[15:08:04] <gahr> so callers can stop comparing chars with ops
[15:08:06] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/3c79124fe3e325add989f5227bc6593bde59c826/conn/dlg_verifycert.c#L92-L96
[15:08:17] <gahr> and we can move to strongly typed enums :D
[15:08:28] <flatcap> yeah, I'd noticed that :-)
[15:08:28] <gahr> meeting, bbl

[15:31:51] <gahr> flatcap: do you have any ideas what OP_EDITOR_QUOTE_CHAR is good for?

[15:32:17] <gahr> it looks like it just skips the char and inserts the next one?
[15:34:12] <flatcap> it's Ctrl-V for inserting literal characters
[15:36:18] <flatcap> (without interpretation from the key-bindings)
[15:36:22] <gahr> ah!
[15:37:20] <gahr> I might have broken it, then :)
[15:37:48] *** Quits: bradfier (~bradfier@user/bradfier) (Quit: Leaving...)
[15:38:12] <flatcap> oh!
[15:39:44] *** Joins: bradfier (~bradfier@user/bradfier)
[15:39:51] <flatcap> one thing I noticed whilst playing with enter.c, is that `quote_event = mutt_getch();` needs to set the timeout, otherwise it won't return OP_TIMEOUT
[15:41:17] <flatcap> I found a few places in the code that interfered with screen updates.  there and in the old Menu code
[15:41:47] <gahr> I might not have broken it... I might not understand how it works
[15:41:51] <gahr> so, macro editor bl <bol>
[15:42:04] <gahr> :foo^Vb^Vl should produce :foobl ?
[15:42:24] <flatcap> yes
[15:42:43] <gahr> but mutt_getch resolves ops
[15:43:00] <gahr> how is the mutt_getch() inside the OP_EDITOR_QUOTE_CHAR supposed not to?
[15:44:05] <gahr> mh let me take that back and look it up
[15:44:22] <flatcap> I think getch() gets a char, but km_dokey() does the translation to OP
[15:44:53] <gahr> true
[15:52:26] <gahr> I think I can't trigger ctrl-V :D
[15:53:13] <flatcap> oh?
[15:53:34] <flatcap> shell/ssh/screen/tmux interfering?
[15:53:50] <gahr> yeah macOs Terminal or tmux
[15:53:57] <gahr> but if I remap q to <quote-char> it works
[15:54:00] <gahr> phew :)
[15:54:03] <flatcap> :-)
[15:55:44] <flatcap> hmm... <space> doesn't work in the editor (that's in b5a657f0d)
[15:56:25] <flatcap> hehe, but Ctrl-V + <space> does (which is what I was going to test)
[15:56:52] <gahr> nice
[15:57:32] <gahr> bind editor \t          complete-query; bind editor <Space>     noop
[15:57:39] <gahr> I think these should be default :)
[15:58:09] <gahr> well the first one *is* default
[15:58:24] <flatcap> yes, there've been a few calls for <space> -> noop
[15:58:37] <flatcap> for entering spaces into filenames (urgh!)
[15:58:47] <gahr> bind editor <Space>     noop; bind editor \C<Space>   mailbox-cycle
[15:58:51] <gahr> this was intended
[15:59:04] <gahr> well or for anytime you're in the editor and are not typing a mailbox :)
[15:59:18] <gahr> like entering a command
[15:59:23] <flatcap> yes
[16:02:07] <gahr> re timeout, I think ncurses reads an env variable for the timeout?
[16:03:37] <gahr> no, it's its own variables
[16:03:54] <gahr> ah no, ESCDELAY is an env variable
[16:04:16] <gahr> ok very specific, disregard
[16:04:29] <flatcap> we're calling timeout() in lots of places
[16:04:45] *** Quits: weirdsmiley (~weirdsmil@103.25.231.102) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[16:07:00] <flatcap> at some point, I'll need to put a `window_redraw()` in that loop, to handle Ctrl-V, then the user resizing the screen
[16:08:24] <gahr> yup I merged the timeout and getch part in https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3318/commits/b5a657f0d37942808b71b6dd92616617ce318a0d
[16:08:27] <gahr> :)
[16:08:39] <flatcap> yes, nice :-)
[16:09:52] <flatcap> I recently added OP_TIMEOUT and OP_ABORT symbols, but they aren't part of the OP_* enum
[16:10:18] <gahr> I was about to change that, too
[16:10:24] <flatcap> great
[16:10:31] <gahr> then I refrained
[16:10:46] <gahr> we don't want people to start mapping keys to OP_ABORT, do we?
[16:11:14] <flatcap> hmm... no
[16:11:44] <flatcap> I wasn't sure what the compiler would make of negative OP_ABORT when squeezed into an 0-based enum
[16:12:48] <flatcap> actually, it's probably ok to add them to the enum...
[16:12:51] <gahr> why is it 0-based?
[16:13:22] <flatcap> the docs, etc, are generated from parsing the `_fmt(OP_X, "desc x")` lines
[16:13:56] <gahr> do they assume a 0-based value?
[16:13:58] <flatcap> because it's not specified in defn `enum MuttOps`
[16:14:11] <gahr> ok yeah we'd need to change the parsing code
[16:14:15] <gahr> that's basically why I didn't do that
[16:14:33] <gahr> we'd need to add OP_ABORT=-2, then skip the =-2 when we parse it
[16:14:38] <gahr> including when we expand _fmt
[16:14:41] <gahr> which sucks
[16:14:42] <flatcap> hang on...
[16:14:59] <flatcap> the docs parse _fmt()
[16:15:29] <flatcap> do we need to add ABORT/TIMEOUT to that?
[16:15:40] <flatcap> can't we just add the symbols to the beginning of the enum?
[16:16:29] <gahr> ah!
[16:16:31] <gahr> sure!
[16:16:37] <gahr> let me do that
[16:16:38] <flatcap> hmm... we'd have to add matching entries to OpStrings[] too
[16:17:09] <gahr> mh
[16:18:16] <gahr> if I can track all uses of ops and remove any checks for < 0
[16:18:37] <gahr> and replace them for explicit checks, we can add OP_ABORT and OP_TIMEOUT and still be 0-based
[16:20:04] <flatcap> hmm... I wonder if any code is expecting OP_NULL == 0

[16:21:20] <gahr> I wonder if this one was expecing ch == 0 because of OP_NULL
[16:21:47] <flatcap> yeah, possibly
[16:21:48] <gahr> I should try to make op a struct so every comparison with an integer fails to compile
[16:22:16] <flatcap> ooh
[16:22:53] <gahr> not saying it's a good idea :)
[16:22:56] <flatcap> hehe
[16:24:11] <flatcap> I think it's definitely worth pushing forward with adding ABORT/TIMEOUT to the enum / OpStrings
