But if I am not a criminal, then I ask that my wife and I be allowed temporarily, at least for a year, to go abroad, so that I may return as soon as it becomes possible in our literature to serve big ideas without serving little people.” He lived in Paris until his death, six years later, at

[01:55:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's taken this long but I guess Finland has finally joined the exclusive club of countries with insane governments that are perfectly fine with policies that kill their own citizens

[02:00:05] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, yes. that is good
[02:00:19] <kuudes> and in uk they are organizing everyone to dose people up
[02:00:24] <gwern> 2022-01-11? is that a joke?
[02:00:27] <kuudes> no
[02:00:42] <kuudes> indeed.
[02:00:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> :(
[02:00:59] <kuudes> we don't see omicron because they are not sequencing for it
[02:01:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that's one way to solve the problem
[02:01:42] <kuudes> our chief health security on national health institution said he has to look into those papers norwegians have put out, the numbers of 90k-300k infections per day sound unbelievable
[02:01:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "No PCR test, no problem" -Stalin probably
[02:02:04] <ggreer> hey it worked for the US back in february of 2020
[02:02:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is definitely what happened, yeah
[02:02:17] <galambo_> the uk doesnt sequence. they just use the s sequence mutation
[02:02:22] <galambo_> s mutation*
[02:02:24] <kuudes> a minor leading doctor of Helsinki said today on twitter that of yesterday's positive results in helsinki 20% were likely omicron, that is s-negative
[02:02:30] <kuudes> galambo_, indeed
[02:02:35] <kuudes> helsinki uses that here
[02:02:40] <kuudes> I don't live in helsinki
[02:02:40] <rmmh> ...why aren't they sequencing?
[02:02:48] <kuudes> takes time, is expensive
[02:02:49] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I guess elves just aren't used to these mortal timescales. we are like mayflies to them. scheduling a meeting 10 doubling times away is like lightning speed for them. they feel young and exhilarated, like it was the springtime of the world again and they're fighting dragons and wooing elvenmaids
[02:02:57] <kuudes> also testing has sort of been shut down partially
[02:03:19] <kuudes> because "everyone willing has got vaccinated, but children" and they are allowing the disease to run free as long as the hospitals manage
[02:03:32] <kuudes> so. our system is operating at full capacity.
[02:03:42] <kuudes> I guess I am not paying taxes for unused icu beds then
[02:04:07] <gwern> all the finnish hospital beds are full right now, already? I don't think omicron or any christmas wave is going to be helpful, then

The use of leeches in medicine is very old and, since their saliva contains a powerful anticoagulant, not without merit. Still, they didn’t help his ear infection. At around the same time I realized what blood eagles were, my father saw a doctor who

[09:52:08] <PapuaHardyNet> doesn't Vinge's Rule make it impossible to model "people smarter than you"? if so, it would make sense to focus on perspectives and lenses over raw knowledge since modelling that is not possible
[09:52:42] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, *that* is interesting, could you describe what you mean by it cutting into your tulpa-storage-space
[09:54:05] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet,  <PapuaHardyNet> doesn't Vinge's Rule make it impossible to model "people smarter than you"? <- the thingie with that, is that intelligence can be made out of _effort_ ; it's not really a fixed thing, and mine oscilates a lot depending on eg sleep schedule, and a bunch of things. and so, "what would <really smart person> do?"
[09:54:06] <SDr> operates as a button to work really hard on that specific question
[09:54:49] <PapuaHardyNet> so that's a motivation trigger?
[09:55:03] <SDr> that, but also, I don't stop on account of bullshit of my own
[09:55:34] <SDr> ("he prolly wouldn't worry much about negative externalities, so how does the problem look like, if neither do I?")
[09:56:08] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[09:56:27] <PapuaHardyNet> makes a lot of sense. this is a super valuable way of thinking
[09:57:04] <SDr> "tulpa-storage-space"   my current model is that tulpas are... made out of voids. evolutionarily, it was super useful to track other people's beliefs, so there's dedicated hardware for that. When you're alone+lonely, you can make up imaginary friends relatively easily (mentalspace voids yearn to be filled up with stuff).  but eg many people
[09:57:04] <SDr> remarked that "tulpas don't come out when there are other people around"  <- because the dedicated hw bites into the actual problem of real people
[09:57:24] <SDr> same thing now with lotsa video conferences: need to track actual peeps, so less brainspace for running tulpas
[09:58:01] <SDr> (I'm... not entirely convinced this is a good trade currently, but am in the process of pivoting my life from "working with/on things" to "working with/on people"
[09:58:03] <SDr> )
[10:01:55] <PapuaHardyNet> SDr: you are becoming a manager / executive? Sweet.
[10:03:10] <SDr> eeeh
[10:03:18] <SDr> people are booooooooring
[10:03:23] <SDr> yet
[10:03:53] <SDr> unlike tulpas, they can really run an execution thread parallel of my own
[10:04:33] <SDr> which is great except for: alignment, capability, intelligence, motivation, skill, execution, measurement, and values :S
[10:05:47] <SDr> so, I do what I must, because I can :P

[10:18:51] <PapuaHardyNet> SDr: reading the links, thank you
[10:22:47] <kuudes> superz, over here they recommend against it; in any case they recommend abstaining hard straing for heart for "some days" after the dose
[10:23:19] <kuudes> iirc the risk is around 100-150 per million for males, but I am quite tired and could remember wrong
[10:23:42] <kuudes> the same group has higher myocarditis risk without vaccine and without disease as well
[10:24:02] <kuudes> was it 20 per million per day or something
[10:25:21] <kuudes> it seems to me that currently pfizer is quite ok as booster, and I guess I would recommend that if available. but moderna is excellent still.
[10:25:49] <kuudes> over here they have halved moderna dose when used as booster, so from 100 units -> 50 units. pfizer is 30 units for adults, 10 units for 5-11 yo
[10:26:44] <kuudes> I have personally taken moderna as third dose for full dose, and it kicked me quite somewhat harder than pfizer
[10:27:14] <kuudes> for omicron, there was some slight data that pfizer payload might hit omicron better than moderna. in any case, booster is vital against omicron

[19:32:28] <Gurkenglas> In Keltham's latest lesson on EYs current main glowfic, he guesses that haggling is an attempt to solve bargaining problems without incentivizing too much deviation from fair trades. Then... when Alice thinks 10$ is a fair price, and Bob thinks 15$ is a fair price, and both would accept the other's price with 50% probability in order to disincentivized dishonesty about what's fair, shouldn't the taxman 
[19:32:28] <Gurkenglas> intervene with "Alice pays 15$, Bob receives 10$, the difference of 5$ goes to the crown. Alice and Bob are no worse off than before my intervention and the crown benefits."?
[19:33:24] <adiabatty> how smart do you need to be to be that dumb
[19:33:45] <Gurkenglas> What is dumb about it? :D
[19:34:11] <adiabatty> they collectively lose $5 for what, faster haggling?
[19:35:18] <Gurkenglas> No, they lose nothing compared to the case where they actually throw a coin - instead they execute the trade every time. They also gain nothing - except in the sense that everyone benefits if lots of value pops up in the crown's coffers.
[19:36:22] <Gurkenglas> ...actually they gain something: they execute the trade every time, and so they have twice the profits from trade that they would have otherwise needed to keep up incentives.
[19:40:41] <catern> hm concerns about CO2 global warming are a lot like concerns about the national debt: it's a long term thing that we continually are contributing to which may have severe bad effects in the future
[19:42:53] <Gurkenglas> Perhaps I am still too vague, let me rephrase. Bob has produced a widget for 5$. Alice could turn a widget into 20$. This is common knowledge. Bob thinks he deserves 15$ for the widget. Alice thinks he deserves 10$ for the widget. Both would profit 5 or 10 dollars depending on what they settle on. In dath ilan, they sometimes randomly don't execute the trade to make sure that both sides only make the profit 
[19:42:54] <Gurkenglas> dictated by the other side. I'm saying a higher power should find a less costly way to give each the profit dictated by the other.
[19:45:30] <Gurkenglas> 1. This benefits the higher power, who can capture the difference 2. If Alice would have bought it with a 50% chance for 15$ to keep Bob's EV at 5$, she makes only 2.5$, whereas the higher power would have given her 5$ profit.

President Bill Clinton altered the packaging to include the signature of the sitting president beneath the presidential seal.[1] President Barack Obama was mixed on the subject of M&M's.

[22:24:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (but actually this in reference to Switzerland specifically)
[22:25:14] <gwern> one might say that germans were the original antivaxxers. it's the romantic naturkultur. I've point this out many times before, but a lot of what is weird (and often bad) about california seems to genealogically descend from germany

[22:28:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Super Troopers was clearly the most accurate portrayal of Germans
[22:29:24] <adiabatic> according to my stereotypes germans are in nudist colonies all day and listen to techno on the radio and do leather bondage clubs at night
[22:29:31] <adiabatic> what are your stereotypes
[22:30:11] <synthmeat> wiki lists "extremely punctual people", "love of order", "no small talk", "no sense of humour"
[22:30:21] <synthmeat> but mine are more aligned to adiabatic

[22:31:36] <gwern> I think the german stereotype is that they are very rational and punctilious until they turn the corner and you discover them nude in a mud pit drinking their own piss for the health benefits
[22:32:04] <adiabatic> well, I figure the leather sex orgies start _on time_

[22:40:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> The former tendency is exemplified by feep's interest in weird compiler shit

[22:41:44] <gwern> it always surprises me that no one makes the german/california connection. I guess the germans looking in just take it for granted as obviously correct ("at least some americans are sensible"), and the americans looking out... well, they don't exist, americans couldn't care less about germany rn
[22:42:15] <gwern> (if an american knows who angela merkel is, they're doing well on their knowledge of germany)
[22:43:49] <gwern> at best, an american might read a little about, say, kafka's fad diets, and go 'lol that sounds a bit like hippies' and turn the page
[22:45:38] <gwern> so if you know about how antivaxxing was really popular among californian hippie-types, then it comes as little surprise if it erupts in germany too
[22:46:47] <Dyo> people are comparing us to california now?
[22:47:06] <adiabatic> I don't _think_ of Germany as particularly California-like.
