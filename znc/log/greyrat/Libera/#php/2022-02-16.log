[03:07:25] <Blondie101010> I'm not sure what the point of using http_response_code() would be outside a web request, but to your script it won't matter
[03:07:47] <Blondie101010> the function simply does the same as usual
[03:08:29] <Albright> It's more like I have a script which could theoretically be run as a CLI and I want to know if I need to wrap the function call in some sort of `if ($not_cli)` or something
[03:08:42] <Albright> *as a CLI script

[08:07:34] <Nekomander> After you've experimented this and confirmed the problem doesn't exist in example scripts, then visit the script you're working on. Take a moment to use var_dump(); in your script for where $_SESSION is used, and then refresh page. What you do next is go to the LINE NUMBER where you used var_dump($_SESSION);, then slowly go up a few lines to where you are using $_SESSION to see where you've created/initiated the variable.

[08:10:41] <sm> thanks for the hints Nekomander. I quit and restarted the browser, it's working as expected now.
[08:11:26] <Nekomander> sm, imo, it's generally better to open/close incognito mode browser. And to always test in incognito mode.
[08:12:00] <Nekomander> Not to use browser built in tools to delete cools. Faster to close/open.
[08:12:27] <sm> makes sense, thanks

[17:52:51] <freeman_h1> Hi all when you use pdo execute, do it automatically close the connection to the database?
[17:53:40] <__adrian> no
[17:53:41] <TinoDidriksen> PDO closes the connection when the PDO object is destroyed, usually at end of the PHP request.
[17:54:20] <__adrian> the connection will be closed when the $pdo instance goes out of scope (or shortly after), when the request is over at the latest
[17:54:57] <__adrian> note in most cases you have no reason to worry about when the connection's closed, though.
[17:56:08] <freeman_h1> __adrian, on my db alot of connections from the same ip
[17:56:20] <__adrian> ok
[17:56:21] <freeman_h1> some a sleep for some hours
[17:56:41] <__adrian> do you have php scripts that run for hours?
[17:57:42] <freeman_h1> nope
[17:58:00] <freeman_h1> I have a cron jobs which query a db every 3 seconds
[17:58:08] <freeman_h1> sorry 30 seconds
[17:58:21] <freeman_h1> and if nothing is the to run it sleep for 30 seconds
[17:58:47] <__adrian> that sounds like something that could easily pile up
[17:59:11] <TinoDidriksen> Is the sleep in the PHP code or does it sleep between executing PHP?
[17:59:19] <__adrian> if you're running this script every 30s via cron, why would you wait if there's nothing to do? if there's nothing to do, then exit.
[18:00:33] <freeman_h1> __adrian, using laravel queue driver its just runs php artisan queue:work --sleep 30 via supervisord
[18:00:53] <freeman_h1> it should close the connections after each usage
[18:01:14] <__adrian> have you checked if the workers are hanging around?
[18:03:16] <__adrian> might also be something specific to laravel (or how you've configured it) - what do they use for queuing?
[18:07:57] <freeman_h1> __adrian, only 3 workers active which is correct for the number of procs

[18:09:41] <__adrian> if the worker is opening the connection, and the worker exits after it's done, then the connection will be closed. if you have a problem, then the cause is likely something else.

[19:41:45] <judah> Why does Magento distribute important security updates via a patch applied with a composer-installed tool, instead of just publishing a release with that fix and giving composer instructions for updating to that version?
[19:41:54] <judah> It seems to be more work for both Magento and its customers to do it with a patch file instead of a direct update
[19:42:02] <judah> Especially since the problem is going to be fixed upstream anyways
[19:42:12] <judah> Or is my company just special?
[19:42:46] <judah> Come to think of it, I think my company is just special. Doing it the long way results in more billable hours so suddenly it makes sense to do it the dumbest way possible
[19:42:54] <__adrian> judah: i understand that you despise magento  :)  this is not the place to vent about it
[19:43:14] <Rockwood_> __adrian, hi sir?
[19:43:44] <__adrian> you might look at #phpc, but #php is for code questions. magento might have their own channel too

[20:05:31] <Naktibalda> applying specific small patch should feel much safer to sysadmins than running composer update in production.

[20:25:12] <NakedKing> thanks __adrian you are awesome, you are the best one.
[20:25:55] <__adrian> there's also room for uncertainty in your description. "$bar exists AND not null" this is isset(), as Naktibalda pointed out. but is that all you want? or do you want to use its value?

[20:38:41] <da_wunder> and if that is not needed then `if ($foo ?? $bar ?? false) { ... }` should do the trick

[22:17:01] <varrg> yes

[22:20:49] <varrg> oh, right. There may be multiple instances of the class, that's why I use a static property
[22:21:00] <__adrian> in fairness, it's the kind of thing that might be ok as static. it's hopefully not going to change during execution.

[23:02:58] <da_wunder> I was just pointing the error that you have
[23:03:04] <Albright> The tutorial may be out of date.
[23:03:14] <da_wunder> ^
[23:03:23] <Albright> Do you not understand the error message?
[23:03:36] <spinningcat> i can understand what error message is,
[23:03:40] <da_wunder> spinningcat: so first question - are you using Laravel 8 ?
[23:04:10] <spinningcat> sec
[23:05:07] <__adrian> spinningcat: your dpaste is all kinds of syntax errors. also you're showing us a tutorial about Product::where, but your error message is about Route::resource()
[23:05:31] <Albright> The dpaste shows syntax errors because it's trying to parse it as Java.
[23:05:36] <spinningcat> yeah it is 8
[23:06:34] <spinningcat> damn
[23:06:40] <da_wunder> spinningcat: then I would just add comment to that video that its't working as expected
[23:07:06] <da_wunder> spinningcat: and really I would recommend you to look official documenation / tutorials for laravel
[23:07:14] <__adrian> or read the relevant laravel docs to see what's wrong
[23:07:49] <da_wunder> or just read that actual error message and just fix that - that is quite clear error message - imho

[23:24:06] <Nekomander> spinningcat, it might be a good idea imo to get into the habit of making use of strict_types=1 for every .php file that you create. https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php#language.types.declarations.strict
[23:24:22] <Nekomander> Why? To reduce as much bugs as possible.
[23:26:10] <spinningcat> yeah sorry for wasting time btw
[23:35:06] <biberu> asking questions isn't a waste of time
[23:36:13] <spinningcat> yeah ofc i just missed the details because i am not really familiar
[23:36:25] <spinningcat> i can do tyops easily and miss it later on
