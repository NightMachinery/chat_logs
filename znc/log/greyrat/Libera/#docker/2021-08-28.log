[03:04:19] <redbrass> Easy question I hope.  I ran "docker build" as a normal user and can then do "docker run" as that user.  But if I su to root and try the "docker run" it can't find the image.

[03:04:40] <redbrass> I'm sure this is a "duh" type thing, but I'm not seeing it at the moment.
[03:07:05] <artok> why would you do docker run as root
[03:07:39] <artok> as you already have permissions to run docker cli as normal user, it has root permissions
[03:08:12] <redbrass> Ultimately I'm trying to get a gitlab-runner to execute a docker container setup with "sudo gitlab-runner register ..."
[03:08:18] <artok> or, is the docker on your host somehow bound to uid and different daemons going on?
[03:08:34] *** Joins: SmokenatorZ (~Smokenato@200.150.183.20)
[03:08:54] <artok> is that sudo really needed?
[03:09:05] <redbrass> for gitlab-runner, yes.
[03:09:19] <artok> I totally don't know what that gitlab-runner does
[03:09:24] <redbrass> Otherwise things ONLY run in user space when you dedicate a terminal to it.
[03:09:59] <artok> terminal to build runner? it shouldn't be needed..
[03:10:23] <artok> doesn't that send all output to the gitlab server what happens on the runner
[03:11:28] <redbrass> different topic here, but... gitlab-runner *should* be set up for shared runners on a dedicated CI/CD server.  However during dev, it is sometimes handy to create the runners locally.  If you have multiple projects, it is convenient to have gitlab-runner act like a daemon and handle many runners.
[03:11:29] <artok> don't you start your gitlab runner with docker run -d -e ENV_VARIABLES_FOR_CONFIG=all gitlab-runner
[03:11:50] <redbrass> nope.  In this case gitlab-runner is a local install.
[03:12:39] <redbrass> And to be fair, gitlab-runner has nothing to do with the problem - other than reporting the underlying docker error.
[03:13:29] <artok> make sure you have correct settings for dockerd 
[03:13:56] <artok> just that on user, you have some ENV etc set so it really can connect to that dockerd, and su doesn't have those
[03:14:14] <redbrass> I can get the same error without gitlab-runner.  As my user - docker build -t myImage.  Then sudo su and "docker run myImage" fails with unable to find image.
[03:14:26] <artok> but connecting to docker.sock should be same, with root or user on docker group
[03:15:24] *** Quits: Eclipse2212 (~Eclipse22@user/eclipse2212) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:16:37] <redbrass> well.. that was stupid of me.  It was trying to find the image "myImage/bin/bash".  Wordwrap had kicked in right after "myImage" making it look like there was a space there...
[03:17:27] <redbrass> Or, I just finished building the image as root.. so one of those two things is problably the fix - or both.
[03:18:48] <artok> building image as root shouldn't be that much different than building it as user, but still, I just don't know your system settings
[03:19:26] <redbrass> hmm.. it's working for me as root or my normal user, but the gitlab-runner still throws the error... it runs under the "gitlab-runner" user, so that could be the root issue.
[03:26:25] <redbrass> Adding the gitlab-runner user to the docker group helps some - I can manually run the image as the gitlab-runner user.  But the gitlab-runner PROCESS is still failing, even after restarting.  I'll try a reboot and see if it is just an odd daemon state.
[03:26:32] <redbrass> Thanks for the support thus far! :)

[06:45:06] <debayer> hey folks, what's the best practice for if i want to test some services i have in docker-compose, but need to test them against external services that are in *another* compose file? keep them separate but give them the same network?
[06:46:30] <tianon> anchovy: you want "--rm" on "docker run" :)
[06:46:35] *** Joins: hwrd (sid64402@tooting.irccloud.com)
[06:47:39] <tianon> debayer: yeah, I'd probably use an external network for the services that need to share (networks are relatively cheap, as long as you don't go too far overboard, so I'd probably even have multiple networks to isolate the things that shouldn't be talked to by the other services from the things that should)
[06:47:59] <debayer> to clarify, the 2nd set of services are for a local testnet of the project my app will communicate with. so in production none of those services will be in my control or anything, i just have to run their stuff locally to test my app. so in production only my app services will apply, but my app needs to talk to the other still during dev
[06:48:26] <debayer> okay cool

[18:20:40] <diverdude> hi, i am running a server on my computer (host) on localhost:8080 which i can reach fine from the machine (host) itself (tested with: nc -z localhost 8080). However from within my docker container i cannot reach it - even if do --net=host it still cannot reach the webserver on the host. How do I fix this?
[18:26:22] <BtbN> If it's actually listening on proper localhost, so, 127.0.0.1, you can't.
[18:26:37] <BtbN> Though I'd expect that with --net=host, you can just connect to 127.0.0.1 in the container?

[18:32:04] <BtbN> The VM Docker is running in can't possibly access localhost of the host.
[18:32:19] <BtbN> Gonna have to bind the service to whatever network Docker uses
[18:32:53] <diverdude> BtbN: is that something specific for mac?
[18:33:03] <BtbN> It's something specific to anything not Linux
[18:33:14] <BtbN> Docker only runs on Linux (ignoring those weird Windows-Containers)
[18:35:26] <diverdude> aha i see.... how do i then bind the service to the container?
[18:35:26] <BtbN> You don't.
[18:35:26] <BtbN> You bind it to whatever network your containers are on.

[18:36:57] <diverdude> BtbN: but if i do docker run -it --net=host zbl-ui_zuibackend bash      then it should be on the hosts network and i should be able to reach the webserver on host from within container right?
[18:38:02] <BtbN> I have no idea how --net=host works if docker itself is running in a VM, like it is on OSX
[18:38:19] <BtbN> It probably just means --net=host inside of that VM. Not on your actual host. It can't possibly do that.
[18:38:31] <diverdude> oh
[18:38:35] <diverdude> hmm :(
[18:39:47] <BtbN> Hence, make your service listen on whatever network the Docker VM is on
[18:39:52] <BtbN> and then connect to it that way
[18:42:28] <diverdude> BtbN: ok i see...and how can i see what network docker vm is on?
[18:42:42] <BtbN> No idea, I don't use OSX.
[18:42:52] <BtbN> Does it not have "ip link"/"ip addr"?
[18:44:44] <diverdude> aha i found in docker docs that on mac i can do: curl http://host.docker.internal:

[23:34:09] <tabakhase> physikoi "bare docker" be pain
[23:35:33] <physikoi> that's what i was thinking. do you have a favorite migration guide (conventional to docker-compose)?
[23:35:55] <tabakhase> nothing rly on guides... docker isnt much of a learning curve, but rather a series of steps :P - so i generally recommend to start with building something small first, get a feel how things work, and then go to "dockerizing" smth existent -> great candidates for that are for example a CI pipeline or such
