[00:59:18] <bomb> JakeSays I don't know man, that sounds like a huge task. why not an object sharing mechanism similar to QML<->C++ in Qt?
[01:00:45] <JakeSays> bomb: dealing with dart ffi is a lot harder than using dart channels.
[01:00:50] <JakeSays> i may investigate that later
[01:01:20] <JakeSays> bomb: and qml doesn't share objects with c++ - it uses QObject's directly.
[01:01:50] <JakeSays> it's deeply integrated in to the qobject lifetime mgmt stuff
[01:02:36] <bomb> yeah, I meant treating Dart an extension to C# for the GUI layer. like QML. but if FFI's too hard, that won't be easy
[01:03:41] <JakeSays> bomb: it'd be dart <->c++<->c#
[01:04:28] <JakeSays> with channels, it's just dart <-> c#

[04:46:30] <Suchiman> teegee: you can just start debugging, then close the app, then press the pause button in VS
[04:47:12] <teegee> how is that different to a breakpoint ?
[04:48:24] <Suchiman> teegee: it will halt in a random thread whereever it's currently at, a breakpoint you usually only set as long as your code still has control, the pausing you can do at anytime, even after your code has exited
[04:49:03] <teegee> oh, I see. When I debug it closes fine

[12:15:03] <ap5> MatthiasVance, pulumi is fine. Especially because you can now have your state where ever you want. I do prefer Terraform over Pulumi, but that is because Pulumi is pretty new, where Terraform is older and more battle tested

[12:24:40] <MatthiasVance> Works like a charm again
[12:25:11] <MatthiasVance> ap5: I find Terraform + Github Actions a bit meh-ish, and we've run into some issues when deleting things as well
[12:25:25] <MatthiasVance> Also if there's an error it doesn't show you exactly where
[12:25:43] <blez> MatthiasVance yea, we talked. I should try it
[12:25:43] <Suchiman> blez: might be that yarn is installed locally to the user and sudo which runs as the root user doesn't have it on the path?
[12:25:43] <MatthiasVance> And I can't be bothered to learn the DSL xD
[12:25:51] <bomb> MatthiasVance sing along this nice tune: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXFSK0ogeg4
[12:25:56] <Suchiman> blez: might try `which yarn` and then use the full path with sudo
[12:26:11] <ap5> MatthiasVance, isn't the deletion going to a problem for Pulumi as well?
[12:26:32] <ap5> You have some shared representation of state. You need that both in Pulumi and in Terraform
[12:27:40] <blez> Suchiman /home/blez/.nvm/versions/node/v14.4.0/bin/yarn
[12:27:49] <blez> why I can't sudo this?
[12:28:06] <Suchiman> blez: because it's in your user directory and not in the global path that sudo uses?
[12:28:18] <Suchiman> blez: just use `sudo /home/blez/.nvm/versions/node/v14.4.0/bin/yarn`
[12:28:21] <ap5> blez, because it is local to your blez user
[12:29:11] <blez> Suchiman /usr/bin/env: ‘node’: No such file or directory

[12:45:06] <MaNa2k> cool
[12:45:29] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: yeah, seems easier than the ARM templates, VS Code said "hey, why not use bicep?" when i looked at my ARM templates a few days ago

[12:45:55] <MaNa2k> lol
[12:46:15] <ap5> Bicep is Microsofts focus going forward
[12:46:23] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: so yeah, and there's a decompile method to go from arm template to bicep

[17:27:42] <teegee> netstat is a fpita with all the stuff i've got open
[17:27:49] <bpmedley> I'm confused, you do not get a "done" message when you place Environemtn.Exit(0) after logger.LogInformation("done")?
[17:28:10] <bpmedley> Also, you can add the process id to netstat and filter the output on that, I believe.
[17:28:23] <teegee> no. "disposing" is the last I get with Env.Exit
[17:29:33] <bpmedley> Have you tried "using var mes = new AzureClient(logger, args[0])" and commenting out "mes.Dispose()" ?
[17:32:44] <teegee> i'll do that when netstat finishes
[17:32:58] <teegee> but it's not practical because I can't do that in my actual application
[17:33:13] <bpmedley> Also, perhaps "netstat -n" will not do dns lookups, I believe.
[17:34:29] <bpmedley> Have you tried .GetAwaiter().GetResult() instead of .Wait() ?
[17:34:44] <teegee> netstat didn't find anything matching my process id
[17:36:38] <teegee> with await using ... it still hangs but now I get the disposing happening after the done in the logs. I guess that makes sense
[17:38:44] <teegee> if I chuck a 1s delay before the Environment.Exit(0) I get my log messages back and it exits
[17:39:29] <teegee> but it feels wrong to do that in a wpf app
[17:40:07] <bpmedley> Completely agreed with you on the feeling.  I wonder what resource is not being freed or whatnot..
[17:40:59] <teegee> yeah, I don't understand
[17:41:04] <teegee> maybe a reboot will fix it

[17:45:11] <bpmedley> teegee : Would you try "return Task.CompletedTask" after "done" and on your other "return" line?  So, two lines with "return Task.CompletedTask"?  And, maybe try only "return" after "done".
[17:49:53] <bpmedley> teegee : Also, would you consider "_deviceClient?.Dispose(true)" ?

[18:00:02] <teegee> interesting development. I updated azure device client from 1.39 to 1.40 and now the process ends. but it's not getting to the end of the Main(). I put a breakpoint after await DisposeAsync and it never breaks there :(
[18:01:00] <teegee> oh, another task.delay saves the day
[18:02:17] <bpmedley> Are you using DisposeAsync now instead of Dispose?
[18:05:07] <smallville7123> eg it does not make sence to create a named mapping since duplicate types of different names are simply aliased to eachother

[18:11:04] <teegee> ship it!
[18:11:53] <smallville7123> tho i dont know if "variant" is the correct term
[18:12:21] <smallville7123> but C++'s std::variant is the closest to a union except it has no type punning capabilities
[18:12:48] <smallville7123> and C# can implement std::variant the same way as it has generics instead of templates
[18:14:55] <smallville7123> plus with type information, reinterperatible array, and the size of the largest available type wanted, you basically have a mixed C union / variant implementation
[18:15:03] <alguien> Mobile-format short videos make no sense on a desktop PC (case in point: youtu.be/nw_FKdaZAl8). There should be different picture formats for mobile and desktop viewing.

[18:17:52] <alguien> smallville7123, vector graphics scales, but still you have breaking points for size, at which eg. menus stop shrinking and become hidden by default and overlaid when revealed
[18:18:10] <smallville7123> oof
[18:19:07] <alguien> That fact clearly shows that one <strike>size</strike> layout does not fit all. How much more is that the case for raster graphics (videos) which have fixed layouts

[18:20:26] <smallville7123> yup
[18:23:30] <teegee> bpmedley: I think it came down to using DisposeAsync. Must have been some sort of thread lock or something that prevented the device client from returning
[18:23:51] <teegee> bpmedley: Thanks for your patience
[18:24:07] <bpmedley> Is that an acceptable change to your Wpf app?

[18:26:49] <bpmedley> Cool.  Some of these edge cases of async/await/synchronous are strange..
[18:27:00] <teegee> although, I have to chuck out unity. apparently it doesn't call DisposeAsync. I had to do that myself

[19:58:54] <interop_madness> Yes, I've seen this JakeSays, i was just wondering if someone had experience with some of them
[19:59:23] <JakeSays> ah ok
[19:59:31] <canton7> What does an "MIT" binary even mean, heh? And what's the difference between that scheme and just AGPL -- AGPL lets you run the binaries just fine. Maybe focalboard is letting you patch the binary, but not recompile it, but that seems odd
[20:00:09] <interop_madness> most of them are vague as far as collaboration is concerned (where do users derive from? can AD be integrated? can user be easily assigned to projects? can they assign a task within a project to themselves or does some admin have to assign it for them? are tasks assigned to someone still visible to others? etc)
[20:00:42] <JakeSays> canton7: agpl places the responsibility of source availability on you. their MIT binary doesn't
[20:01:22] <canton7> JakeSays, what source would a user have to make available?
[20:01:29] <JakeSays> can https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/blob/main/LICENSE.txt
[20:01:42] <JakeSays> canton7: the source to focalboard
[20:02:13] <canton7> Not under AGPL they don't? If you're just running an AGPL binary, you don't need to make its source available to others, unless I misunderstood the license
[20:02:25] <DevJohnC> canton7, AGPL is like GPL but when you're hosting a service, so all your code built upon an AGPL binary would have to be available to be AGPL compliant
[20:02:58] <DevJohnC> anybody who can access and use your service would have to have equivalent access to your source code
[20:03:00] <canton7> "Built upon" is vague. Linking is... problematic. Just running it in a docker container and talking to it over a network is fine, no?
[20:03:16] <DevJohnC> canton7, that's for lawyers to decide/discuss :P
