[02:01:15] <neshpion> if i want to run a containerized nginx proxy to all other docker containers, do i need to expose the docker daemon to remote hosts?  or is that unnecessary
[02:01:28] <ada_> hackinghorn: in a container, the default user is 'root' so if the container creates files, they get created as root
[02:05:37] <ada_> hackinghorn: you can control that with the --user flag or by chowning the files/directory that your container might create in an entrypoint script
[02:06:25] <hackinghorn> ahh thankss
[02:30:33] <tabakhase> hackinghorn if you dont like sudo, there is `docker run -it --rm --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh` :P
[02:31:11] <tabakhase> extra note that "bindmounts that dont exist yet" will be created by docker-daemon, not you, not the container, so they are ALWAYS root (exception for rootless docker obvs apply)

[03:20:22] <tabakhase> neshpion docker commit is the devil :|
[03:20:54] <neshpion> well that's a relief, i'm evil and i was wondering where i could find the devil
[03:21:15] <tabakhase> and afaik the few rare cases where it was "actually needed" are now handlable with buildx (/dev/xyz)
[03:21:47] <tabakhase> so rather, share why you think you need it, and get that fixed instead ;-)
[03:24:01] <neshpion> i'm not 100% sure exactly what series of commands i need to set up a container and would rather experiment interactively to do so, before sitting down and writing a dockerfile, to make sure i can get an image that has what i want
[03:25:05] <tabakhase> (cause like, you wouldnt be the first that comes in here wanting todo that because "they cant pres accept on apt" - when all ya need is a "-y" in the command :D -- or people that fail cause a thing asks for a default when `debconf-set-selections` has a switch for it ;-) )
[03:26:14] <tabakhase> there is nothing wrong with "fireing up a bash container to get your dockerfile setup" - so yea, thats just fine --- but youd use that to build a dockerfile, and then build that as image to actually use 
[03:26:40] <neshpion> yeah that's kind of the idea, experiment with an interactive container so i can figure out what needs to go in a dockerfile
[03:27:42] <tabakhase> cause... in about a week when your OS of choice had updated cause of CVE-whatever you WILL have to redo the whole thing. - apt-get UPGRADE &co is "strongly forbidden" in a container (docker can naver delete a thing, so it would just grow and grow and grow - until you hit MAX_LAYERS hardlimit :D))

[03:41:22] <velix> tabakhase: nginx reverse-proxy, where ... hmm ... Germany? Netcup? Debian?
[03:42:30] <tabakhase> velix so just http? - what speaks against published ports? - you just add the IP on the host itself, and "-p 1.2.3.4:80:8080" or whatever
[03:42:59] <velix> tabakhase: I've read that shared host network is the worst you can ever do.
[03:43:08] <velix> it's 01:13 am here. Sorry, I'm too tired. Let's talk tomorrow.
[03:43:40] <tabakhase> "shared host network" would maybe be "--net host" ? -- and i wouldnt call it worst... it just "disables the network-issolation portion of docker"
[03:44:50] <tabakhase> (the "actual put container on my lan" keyword be "macvlan"&co - but like, only reason one is allowed todo that is cause you wanne run a DHCP-server or so in the container (as that isnt rly tcp/ip))
[03:45:25] <tabakhase> plus you obvs. add the whole bridge&mac playpool where then what your hoster supports becomes part of the story...)

[04:24:52] <c10l> Is there a way to influence which network's IP the gateway DNS will answer with?
[04:25:23] <c10l> Quick description of use-case: reverse-proxy container on 2 networks (let's call them `web` and `private`, where `web` is a normal bridge, and `private` is `internal: true` and is only used to connect to backend services).
[04:25:30] <c10l> backend-service with 2 networks as well (same `private`, plus `egress` which gets an IP from the external router's DHCP, and is inaccessible from other containers).
[04:26:16] <c10l> When I start this, sometimes reverse-proxy will resolve `backend-service`'s IP from the `private` network, which is fine and produces the expected results. At other times OTOH, it resolves to the `egress` IP which is unreachable. Can I control that in any way in the compose v3 file?

[17:17:43] <luva> I followed the dockerhub info on how to deploy a wordpress docker container. https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress ... so under volumes I set up like described there: /srv/Config/wordpress:/var/www/html , yet the directory on my host is empty, although inside the docker I can see all the files that should be mounted on host. Any explanations?
[17:20:44] <wez> so /srv/Config/wordpress on your host contains no files?
[17:21:02] <wez> but /var/www/html in your docker container does?
[17:21:33] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)
[17:27:48] <programmerq> luva: are you running docker desktop? The /srv/Config/wordpress might be inside the VM where docker is running instead of on your mac. The host side of that bind mount will be wherever the actual dockerd process is running.
[17:28:36] <programmerq> also, double check for any typos on the host or container path and check for any conflicting volumes via 'docker inspect <container>'
[17:30:13] <luva> Im running normal docker, dont know if desktop, how can I find out? its running on top of ubuntu.. Mounting other directories worked and I  can see filess on host, e.g. /srv/config/wordpress/logs:/var/log/apache2

[17:31:24] <luva> but if I understand correctly, docker desktop is when you run docker on an actual machine, if thats the case, the answer is yes
[17:31:38] <programmerq> if you're just running dockerd directly on ubuntu, then you're not running docker desktop.
[17:31:59] <luva> yeah im doing like that. dockerd on ubuntu
[17:32:24] *** Joins: moldorcoder7 (~moldorcod@77.47.48.24)
[17:32:25] <programmerq> docker desktop for mac/windows is a tray icon that runs docker in a VM for you and tries to automatically forward published ports and set up file sharing from the mac/windows host to that VM for stuff like bind mounts, so that's not what you're using.
[17:32:52] <luva> nope
[17:32:58] <programmerq> so yeah, use 'docker container inspect <container>' to double check what your volumes actually are. Share that output in a gist/pastebin if you want another set of eyes here to take a look.
[17:34:03] <luva> seems like you were correct
[17:34:36] <luva> for some reason, it added the rest so its like this:  /srv/Config/DockerRoot/volumes/7d8b3536d8684fda513cf4ac79f55842b3b4f315598b62283153d597b26f3808/_data

[17:42:28] <programmerq> that looks like an anonymous volume, which would happen if the image specifies that /var/www/html should be a volume but you didn't specify one. How did you start the container? a docker run command? do you still have it in your shell history?
[17:42:59] <programmerq> if you put the -v after the image name, then it would have been processed as an argument by the entrypoint script inside the container instead of as an argument to the docker run command.

[21:21:17] <qwofford> I'm trying to help someone do something which seems a little insane, at least to me as a Linux user. They want to launch Docker Windows client, run a Linux container (using whatever Hyper-V kernel virtualization), and then bind back into a Windows mount point to access data which is too large to fit in the container.
[21:22:14] <qwofford> I see the client has an option to add a windows mount point via the gui. I assume this handles whatever NTFS/ext filesystem conversions are required? What's going on here, really?
[21:26:25] <qwofford> Crucially, I want to understand if -v will bind, or if it will try to copy the contents of the source directory into some intermediate directory before running the container.

[22:55:30] <qwofford> Huh. I'm now experimenting with the WSL, because this seems a more direct path. It seems that I have added the Windows mount point to the WSL fstab successfully. However, when I run "docker -v /mnt:/mnt ..." from the powershell, the container shows an empty /mnt.
[22:56:34] <qwofford> Tempted to add docker to the WSL form the linux CLI, but not clear what package manager this thing even uses. 
[22:56:47] <qwofford> invoking docker from powershell to get to WSL seems like an unnecessary complexity
[22:58:07] <ada_> with WSL, there's no filesharing mechanism since wsl uses windows' filesystem natively

[23:36:29] <micah> to me, this means copy what is in the CWD to the CWD
[23:36:41] <dodo> yeah
[23:36:45] <micah> i do not see the point of doing that
[23:36:49] <dodo> er
[23:37:03] <dodo> COPY first arg is host fs, second container
