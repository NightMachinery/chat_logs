[00:42:09] <mrig> ah sockets are slightly later than the original UNIX I suppose; Would they not count as UNIX plumbing?
[00:43:02] <webNET4> UNIX domain sockets?
[00:43:20] <webNET4> ok well pretend i said pipe instead then
[00:43:22] <mrig> webNET4: thus the need for some sort of a plan, I think the same is true no mater the environment, the complexity just gets shuffled about.

[00:45:10] <mrig> But I enjoy go's error handling, I imagine that it is pretty similar to using errors within the system.
[00:45:11] <webNET4> what i mean is, if you try to model all of the complexity visually it's just going to be a mess. but if you're only after a small subset of unix plumbing that might be ok
[00:45:35] <mrig> Actually this is an area that I'd like to develop, error handling.

The difference is that on SVID systems the signal handler is deinstalled after signal delivery. On BSD systems the handler must be explicitly deinstalled. In the GNU C Library we use the BSD version by default."

[04:44:21] <webNET4> your old program hopeufly static links
[04:44:44] <oldlaptop> (on the opposite pole, openbsd reserves the right to completely break its kernel ABI in any random release - when they made time_t a long long everywhere, that was just a normal release)
[04:44:46] <Izem> dynamic linking seems to be a mistake
[04:44:48] <vdamewood> webNET4: no need to statically link, you just have to make sure to use the exact same shared libraries as the original.
[04:45:18] <Izem> maybe for the base part of the os, otherwise it seems to cause lots of headaches
[04:45:29] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: Yep OpenBSD 4.0 is just as different from 3.9 as 3.9 was from 3.8.
[04:45:54] <oldlaptop> and dynamically-linked programs don't get to make syscalls without libc, either, anymore (that makes certain buffer overrun mitigations harder to work around)
[04:46:40] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: libc-only, is that an OpenBSD thing?
[04:47:01] <oldlaptop> Not uniquely so, it seems to be pretty common for the C library to be the only documented, stable system call interface
[04:47:24] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: Yeah, I think macOS does that too.
[04:47:26] <oldlaptop> openbsd may or may not be unique in enforcing that on the pain of abort()ing your process' ass if it tries to make syscalls itself
[04:48:12] <vdamewood> I think macOS just doesn't make any guarantees about the kernel ABI and if your program breaks in a new version, well that's your problem.
[04:48:16] <oldlaptop> it's linux that's unusual, really, so far as I can tell
[04:48:48] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: Well, one difference is that with Linux, the libc is itself an external project, that they have no control over.
[04:48:54] <oldlaptop> (windows binary compatiblity, to the extent it works, generally relies on wine-like layers, AIUI, not system call ABI stability)
[04:49:04] <oldlaptop> That is also extremely unusual.
[04:49:18] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: You mean Windows' 'subsystems'?
[04:49:36] <oldlaptop> Probably not.
[04:49:51] <vdamewood> Hmm... okay

[07:19:06] <smallville7123> yes
[07:19:45] <smallville7123> if it does not know what its relative position is then it cannot calculate an absolute position in the top most view

[07:22:56] <smallville7123> eg if the child is half inside the view and half outside the view, then the child should not be drawn completely, also anything outside the view should not be passed to the child even if it would otherwise be passed if the view containing the child was large enough to fit the child

[07:29:16] <webNET4> GUI work is tough i had to throw my first design out completely, i think ifyou focus on what exactly the cause of problem is and not try to force it's design in a specific way you could simplify your code . like make a complete list of exactly what it HAS to do, vs non-essential features
[07:31:58] <smallville7123> in the context of a view hierarchy, a view's relative position is relative to its parent relative position right?
[07:31:59] <webNET4> and on embedding windows/views, you can treat them like black boxes on the higher level view you really don't need any details aside from rectangle
[07:33:07] <smallville7123> eg if the parent relative is 25, 25, 75, 75, then the child relative is 0, 0, 50, 50, right?
[07:33:08] <webNET4> it's up to you really,  for simplicity i don't use relative positions outside of layout generation
[07:34:04] <smallville7123> eg if the current relative is 25, 25, 75, 75, then the child relative is 0, 0, 50, 50, right?     *
[07:34:17] <webNET4> though my requirements are rather simple themselves

[07:42:19] <smallville7123> if the child has padding then it is also considered when calculating the relative position of the child, if the padding is 10 on top left, then the child has a drawing range of 10, 10, 40, 40

[11:00:14] <smallville7123> thats why i define a range that position and padding must lay between to correctly scale to NDC

[11:39:35] <smallville7123> i cannot scale it by the virtual canvas it it's fixed to 100 and this WILL NOT scale with the actual window size, eg if the window is 200 and the canvas is 100

[11:53:23] <CoJaBo> Wellthatsucks............. Just spent about 14 days building an AI model to track a certain scam ring, and now that it's in a functional state............. it doesn't work D=
[11:53:29] <Akronymus> marginsize * parentsize / childsize

By default Shake includes support for dependencies on files, the existence of files, environment variables, directory contents and several others, and adding more to your project is easy. In particular you can include dependencies on things

[14:33:32] <user51> if i went breadth-first through programming languages, how many languages will i need to go through until i reach dimnishing returns?
[14:33:43] <DnzAtWrk> 1
[14:33:58] <smallville7123> basically, as i said before, each view is a compositor, which acts as a viewport in that it's contents gets scaled and positioned as needed by the parent view, much like a viewport does

[14:38:03] <smallville7123> in my case, the viewport has an inital position of zero, and it gets translated to a drawing position which is also equivilant to a viewport

[14:44:35] <smallville7123> eg window specifies viewport of 0, 0, 100, 100 to view A, view A copies this to this->drawPosition and A's associated viewport is copied to drawDimensions, then A calculates the viewport this->drawPosition based on associated position, associated padding, and associated viewport which is assigned to drawDimensions

[14:47:50] <smallville7123> view A can also layout its children based on its associated virtual canvas, which is passed to view B as a viewport which assigns to B->drawPosition the same way as window specifies viewport and assigns it to A->drawPosition

[14:48:38] <user51> arahael: basically, i'm looking at programming languages top-down. then making a list of features each one has. maybe calling it 'set theoretically' would be more precise. in the end the language would be some permutation of that list of features.

[18:08:47] <mrig> rexar89: It does depend a great deal upon the protocol that you are using.
[18:09:46] <mrig> base64 is used for sending info over HTTP as it does not require escaping and you can I think compress the data a certain amount.
[18:10:51] <Akronymus> I wish ftp were still wider supported.
[18:11:02] <Akronymus> Maybe with ipv6 we can get those back.
[18:11:05] <Akronymus> But doubt it
[18:11:11] <mrig> It is quite simple to set up ftp though.
[18:11:17] <Akronymus> Not really

[18:13:54] <Akronymus> Made it exposed to the internet and didn't get pwned.
[18:14:10] <mrig> I would think that the ease of use of make could be drastically improved with better error messages.

[18:55:56] <pyzozord> Guest59: I think you maybe just talk with someone about it, be heard. If you can give more details maybe someone can offer some more thoughts / opinions
[18:56:18] <DnzAtWrk> usually I get annoyed by "talk to a lawyer" when talking about basic stuff, but it's warranted in this case
[18:56:46] <DnzAtWrk> for example when discussing copyright
[18:56:48] <gamah> Akronymus: i like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt so long as i can without feeling silly
[18:56:48] <Akronymus> DnzAtWrk Usually I go with "In my opinion this and that but talk to a lawyer before doing anything"

[23:12:22] <gamah> i don't think you took my joke to heart when i said that it's entirely possible that the strings "you are wrong" and "this is a bad idea" could, in meta, theoreteically, have the same hash...
[23:12:45] <sumthing1980> thats where the point lies
[23:12:51] <sumthing1980> in the nature of the collisions
[23:12:55] <gamah> for example... lets simplify... you're mystifying md5 too much... i'm gonna give you a much simpler function
[23:13:07] <sumthing1980> and I think there is no way they can be as such
[23:13:10] <gamah> the function is LastLetter... the keyspace is 26 letters long
[23:13:18] <gamah> the function just returns the last letter of the input
[23:13:20] <sumthing1980> but still
[23:13:22] <sumthing1980> to make sure
[23:13:36] <sumthing1980> if for example you can also provide the length of the message
[23:13:39] <gamah> so now "butts lol" and "holy crap this is al ong sentence can you believe they still collide lol" have the same hash
[23:13:42] <sumthing1980> what do you think then
[23:13:50] <gamah> and if all i give you is "l"
[23:13:58] <gamah> you can't infer which sentence is the correct one
[23:14:10] <sumthing1980> if you give the md5 of "I" and say it is length 1
[23:14:13] <gamah> but you don't have the length of the input for md5...you only have an output
[23:14:13] <sumthing1980> Ill find it fast
[23:14:23] <gamah> sure
[23:14:32] <gamah> but as soon as your length exceeds the keyspace of md5 it's meaningless
[23:14:32] <sumthing1980> ok so say you give the length as well 
[23:14:37] <sumthing1980> md5+length
[23:14:38] <gamah> doesn't matter
[23:14:42] <gamah> same problem exists.
[23:15:10] <sumthing1980> so you say if there is a collision the other colliding message is magically a fully perfect sentence in say english
[23:15:29] <Izem> alycidyne: really
[23:15:34] <Izem> that's in the c spec?
[23:15:38] <sumthing1980> I say from what Ive seen in md5 collisions that is not how it works
[23:15:52] <Izem> or a clever detail?
[23:15:56] <sumthing1980> the md5 collision demonstrations are like they take a jpeg pic and alter some bits somewhere

[23:16:33] <gamah> yeah now imagine that with a bunch of words instead of a bunch of jpeg data
[23:16:34] <gamah> same issue
[23:16:35] <sumthing1980> that small bit change is not seen in a jpeg but it would alter a written message 
[23:16:48] <sumthing1980> it would alter it.
[23:16:55] <NetMatic4> they are big endian in the case of bit shifting and literal representation
[23:16:56] <gamah> it didn't in the jpeg example
[23:17:01] <sumthing1980> thats how you know it is not the correct message
[23:17:01] <gamah> why can't the same thing happen with sentences?
[23:17:25] <sumthing1980> because in a ascii string if you alter some bits

[23:31:31] <user51> gameboy should also have rotations
[23:32:04] <alycidyne> speaking of arches, I wonder why the minimalist ones always use ADD, never SUB - when SUB can do so much more
[23:32:05] <NetMatic4> super nintenfdo has mode7 but it can only rotate one sprite
[23:32:52] <alycidyne> SUB can do ADD when used on a negative number, it can stand in for comparisons, it can increment when using sign-extended immediates - honestly so underrated
[23:33:36] <NetMatic4> or ack i forget, there is a trick to use the DSP chip for sin/cos to manually rotate things
