[03:42:53] <biberao> in complex
[03:47:56] <madez> a complex number can be viewed as a point in a 2d plane
[03:48:25] <biberao> yes
[03:48:53] <madez> and each of those points can be written as a distance from the (zero, zero) point and an angle, if one axis is distinguised as the zero degree axis
[03:49:45] <madez> e^(i*theta) is a complex number on the unit circle around (zero, zero), pointing into the directoin theta
[03:49:46] <biberao> ok
[03:49:55] <biberao> i see

[04:05:46] <biberao> ill paste something
[04:05:50] <biberao> let me find it
[04:05:59] <alphamul2> cis(a+bi)?
[04:06:17] <buster> biberao, one is the conjugate of the other
[04:06:20] <biberao> im handicapped
[04:06:41] <alphamul2> That's equivalent of saying that the angle is negative, yes.
[04:06:47] <alphamul2> Or the imaginary part is
[04:06:49] <buster> they're somewhat interchangeable and not very different
[04:07:11] <alphamul2> (Only for 2D plane, obviously)
[04:07:13] <biberao> example
[04:07:14] <buster> biberao, what's the difference between i and -i? they're both square roots of -1. which one is better?
[04:07:25] <alphamul2> That's a roots of unity issue

[04:07:57] <buster> where does the bar go, biberao?
[04:08:08] <biberao> buster: on z
[04:08:25] <buster> i'm assuming the second z
[04:08:35] <biberao> yes
[04:08:47] <biberao> else id say z squared
[04:08:50] <biberao> :p

[04:09:35] <alphamul2> Well, I was defining roots of unity aspet.
[04:09:37] <alphamul2> aspect
[04:09:50] <buster> biberao, presumably the idea is for you to write z=e^(i*theta) first, then substitute that into z^2=(z bar)
[04:09:55] <alphamul2> So you can just rotate it by some amount and still get a valid root
[04:09:57] <biberao> yes

[04:11:03] <biberao> alphamul2: can you explain 2pi/n?
[04:11:12] <alphamul2> Say you have a full circle
[04:11:12] <buster> biberao, (e^(i*theta))^2 = (e^(i*theta))^bar. can you simplify that?
[04:11:18] <alphamul2> That's 2Pi radians
[04:11:23] <alphamul2> Or 360 degrees
[04:11:34] <alphamul2> So if you have a square root, that's 2nd root
[04:11:38] <alphamul2> n=2
[04:11:49] <alphamul2> So you get the circle cut into 2 slices
[04:11:49] <biberao> buster:

[04:12:47] <alphamul2> Cube root of 1 is same way but circle is broken into 3 slices.  (Using cake analogy)
[04:12:52] <biberao> since r seems to be 1
[04:13:04] <biberao> its 1^2*e^i2theta

[04:13:46] <alphamul2> OK, say you had the 4th root of 1
[04:14:09] <buster> so altogether we have r^2 e^(2i*theta) = r^2 e^(-i*theta)
[04:14:10] <alphamul2> What are the 4 roots?

[04:29:47] <biberao> where was that i?
[04:29:51] <alphamul2> I linked to an article that explains it in detail.  And it has worked examples.  :(
[04:29:59] <biberao> alphamul2: ill check thanks
[04:30:18] <biberao> so e^(2iθ)=e^(-iθ) implies e^(2iθ)=e^(-iθ+2kπi), ok?
[04:30:24] <buster> yep
[04:30:39] <buster> then 2iθ = -iθ+2kπi
[04:30:46] <buster> then divide both sides by i
[04:30:54] <alphamul2> YW.  So, how far are you into trig?
[04:31:00] <buster> 2θ=-θ+2kπ
[04:31:11] <biberao> ok
[04:31:28] <biberao> but again maybe im being stupid
[04:31:44] <alphamul2> Unlike a classroom, none of us are obviously at some known progress
[04:31:46] <alphamul2> XD
[04:31:58] <biberao> alphamul2: i study alone
[04:32:04] <alphamul2> Well, it's kind of abstract
[04:32:15] <biberao> buster: im still a bit confused
[04:32:27] <alphamul2> And it works because of things they explain in that article
[04:32:37] <buster> biberao, if you have x+y, and you multiply it by z, you get zx+zy; if you divide that by z again, you get back to x+y.
[04:32:46] <biberao> i dont mean that

[04:33:38] <alphamul2> Basically, tl;Dr:  Multiplying (1 at angle A) by (1 at angle B) = (1 at angle [A+B])
[04:34:09] <alphamul2> Multiplying those works like exponents
[04:34:30] <alphamul2> (because it technically, is)
[04:35:07] <alphamul2> e^(A) * e^(B) = e^(A+B)
[04:35:17] <biberao> right
[04:35:31] <alphamul2> That formula from earlier... with cosine and sine
[04:35:49] <alphamul2> So, then it becomes a division problem to do roots
[04:35:57] <buster> biberao, we got three solutions, for k=0,1,2: θ=0,2π/3,4π/3
[04:36:01] <alphamul2> That is, you break the circle up
[04:36:17] <alphamul2> Which is a nice diversion into geometry :D
[04:36:53] <buster> and they all satisfy the equation, z²=̱̱zbar
[04:36:56] <biberao> buster: those are the solutions that "-theta" can assume?
[04:37:40] <buster> yes. substitute those into z=re^(iθ) to get three different values of z
[04:37:44] <biberao> i understand its divided by i and that
[04:37:52] <biberao> but the 2kpi is what confuses me ahha
[04:38:03] <buster> if we didn't do the 2kπi business, we wouldn't have got all three solutions
[04:38:09] <biberao> what would happen
[04:38:20] <biberao> if instead of 2theta=-theta+2kpi
[04:38:27] <biberao> would be theta=-theta
[04:38:36] <buster> 2theta=-theta
[04:38:41] <biberao> ?
[04:38:46] <buster> or 3theta=0, or theta=0
[04:39:18] <alphamul2> So, related thing:  cosine(A) = cosine(B), so A=B, amirong?  :D
[04:39:25] <buster> hmm. well theta=-theta if you like, but i don't see where it comes from. anyway, it implies theta=0, right?
[04:39:34] <biberao> buster: sure but
[04:39:41] <biberao> its the 2kpi that confuses me thats all
[04:39:43] <biberao> why we add that
[04:39:58] <buster> because if we don't, we only get one solution
[04:40:24] <buster> let me do things again in a different order
[04:40:28] <biberao> ok
[04:40:34] <biberao> provide me a good example
[04:41:11] <alphamul2> (this is example of one-to-many and many-to-one mappings)
[04:41:38] <buster> we started with z²=zbar; then r²e^(2iθ)=re^(-iθ); next step, re^(3iθ)=1
[04:41:42] <alphamul2> Many functions have more than one input that leads to the same output.
[04:41:59] <buster> now we know r=1 and e^(3iθ)=0
[04:42:13] <qergle> we don't
[04:42:17] <buster> =1, sorry. then go and read alphamul2's link
[04:42:28] <biberao> buster: what link
[04:42:32] <biberao> the hops?
[04:42:32] <qergle> when you divided by r you assumed r≠0. but z=0 satisfies z²=z-bar

[04:43:22] <buster> qergle, we mentioned it earlier, I think. we're assume r>0.
[04:43:31] <biberao> r>0
[04:43:33] <biberao> yes
[04:43:46] <buster> z=0 is a somewhat different case. we don't get three solutions then.
[04:44:14] <Fangs> a complex function is complex differentiable if and only if df/d(zbar) = 0
[04:44:41] <Fangs> it's easy enough to check the definition and shove the symbols around that this is equivalent to the usual cauchy-riemman equation
[04:45:03] <Fangs> (or at least the version i'm familiar with, Df looks like a complex number)
[04:45:19] <Fangs> what's a good intepretation for this 'version' of cauchy riemman?

[04:47:31] <buster> biberao, alphamul2 had another good question for you, related to the 2kπ thing
[04:47:43] <buster> [<alphamul2> So, related thing:  cosine(A) = cosine(B), so A=B, amirong?  :D]
[04:47:44] <Fangs> I can't help but think that there's some sense that complex differentiable functions are not "truly" 2-dimensional (in the real dimension sense)

[15:44:31] <Fangs> ramified covering is not something I'm familiar with. so the map from C to C given by f(z) = z^n and exp(z) are all 'ramified' over 0
[15:45:38] <Fangs> my understanding is merely that where as everywhere else, there are n (or infinite) primage of any w =/= 0 in the image, but things looks 'bad' at 0
[15:46:35] <rubiksdream> you dont need any covering space theory for this currently, im not sure how it helps in this scenario
[15:46:50] <rubiksdream> its true that the notion of analytic continuation is tied to covering spaces
[15:47:06] <rubiksdream> because an analytic continuation is a lift of a path to the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions
[15:47:07] <Fangs> rubiksdream: I don't think it'll help, covering spaces is just something I happen to know about
[15:47:21] <Fangs> I don't actually know the connection either
[15:47:23] <rubiksdream> but for all of that you first need the identity principle
[15:47:36] <rubiksdream> which is the thing about power series I mentioned before
[15:47:43] <rubiksdream> identity principle -> analytic continuation
[15:48:58] <rubiksdream> a ramified covering is a covering map with a ramification point, a ramification points is if you like a singularity, more specifically its just a point where the map is not locally injective
[15:49:01] *** Joins: arseniiv (~arseniiv@94.41.6.151.dynamic.ufanet.ru)
[15:49:10] <rubiksdream> in terms of riemann surfaces, it means f' has a zero at the point
[15:49:31] <rubiksdream> its also called a 'branch point' , because at these ramification points, the map looks locally like a powering map z -> z^m
[15:49:45] <rubiksdream> there are 'm branches' of f that emanate from the ramification point
[15:49:51] <rubiksdream> (one for each mth root of unity)
[15:49:59] <rubiksdream> and thats what the surface will really look like at that point
[15:50:05] <rubiksdream> (there are m -tangents)
[15:50:21] <Fangs> rubiksdream: wouldn't that  make calling 0 a ramified point for z^n or exp(z) tautological?
[15:50:34] <rubiksdream> 0 is a ramification point of z^n, yes
[15:50:39] <rubiksdream> simply because its derivative vanishes there
[15:50:44] <rubiksdream> (its not locally injective in any disk at 0)
[15:50:54] <Fangs> in my head this is the *only* example of a ramified-anything that I understand
[15:51:07] <rubiksdream> exp(z) is an unramified covering C -> C \setminus {0}
[15:51:29] <rubiksdream> *not injective in any disk at 0
[15:51:49] <Fangs> e^z = 0 has no solution..
[15:51:56] <rubiksdream> right
[15:52:09] <rubiksdream> its the only point exp misses in the complex plane
[15:52:12] <Fangs> isn't there a universal-cover analogue for ramified covering example?
[15:52:29] <Fangs> z^oo isn't really a thing
[15:52:40] <rubiksdream> not sure what you mean by a universal cover analogue
[15:53:12] <Fangs> z^n is an n-fold cover of the circle (or C-{0})
[15:53:19] <rubiksdream> indeed
[15:53:35] <Fangs> if you just add 0, you get a "ramified covering example" (in the colloquial sense.. don't ask me to define this)
[15:54:15] <rubiksdream> yes
[15:54:15] <Fangs> exp: R -> S^1 is a universal cover, probably one of the first you'll ever learn
[15:54:37] <Fangs> naively, I think exp: C -> C-{0} is also a universal cover
[15:54:41] <rubiksdream> a ramified covering is as you say, a covering map except on a small set
[15:54:54] <rubiksdream> exp : C -> C-{0} is the universal cover of C-{0}
[15:54:58] <rubiksdream> so you are right
[15:55:16] <Fangs> but adding back zero doesn't give a ramified covering
[15:55:49] <Fangs> ah ok, I think I can make this precise. is there a "simple" example of a branched covering f: X -> Y, such that on Y - {pt} (or maybe discrete points) you have a universal cover
[15:55:51] <rubiksdream> theres nothing to add to C
[15:56:05] <rubiksdream> you can add 0 to C \setminus {0} and get a ramified covering C -> C

[16:05:40] <rubiksdream> so i think if such an example existed, it would have to be weird

[16:06:58] <rubiksdream> if X can be disconnected i think there are easy examples
[16:08:35] <rubiksdream> basically just take a really dumb example, R U {pt} (disjoint union), and f : R U {pt} -> S^1, where f |R is the usual covering map, and f(pt) = any random point, this is continuous
[16:08:52] <rubiksdream> whoops, i mean f : R U {pt} -> S^1 U {pt'}
[16:08:56] <rubiksdream> f(pt) = pt'
[16:09:08] <rubiksdream> and f | R is the universal cover R -> S^1

[17:09:17] <Fangs> I think this was my mistake. the map exp: g -> G in general needs not be surjective (I think?) and even when it is surjective, it needs not be a covering map
[17:10:42] <rubiksdream> sounds like it
[17:10:58] <rubiksdream> and even if it is a covering map, the domain doesn't need to be the universal cover
[17:11:12] <rubiksdream> so simple connectivity doesn't really have anything to do with it
[17:11:29] <Fangs> my thought was this: if exp: so3 -> SO(3) is surjective, then so3 ~= R^3 is a covering map. morever its a universal cover, but the universal cover of SO(3) is SU(2) (homeo to S^3)
[17:11:50] <Fangs> rubiksdream: if it is a covering map, why wouldn't it be a universal cover?
[17:11:52] <rubiksdream> where does 'moreover its a universal cover' come from?
[17:12:14] <rubiksdream> the universal cover of a space is its (unique) simply connected cover
[17:12:27] <rubiksdream> a space has more than just a simple connected cover though

[17:12:59] <Fangs> it'd be iso to some R^n
[17:13:00] <buster> also o(3)=so(3), so exp:o(3)->O(3) has image SO(3) ... tempted to say the image of the exponential is always the connnected component
[17:13:10] <buster> but i won't in case i get jumped on :)
[17:13:13] <Fangs> buster: thats true

[17:13:29] <buster> *connected component of the identity
[17:13:30] <Fangs> buster: O(3) is effectively Z/2Z x SO(3)
[17:14:00] <Fangs> so to get to the other half you need your Z/2Z to act on the image to get to the 'other' part of O(3)
[17:14:11] <rubiksdream> in general there are as many covers (up to isomorphism) as subgroups of a spaces fundamental group
[17:14:30] <rubiksdream> so as long as a space is not simply connected, there are non simply connected covers
[17:14:32] <Fangs> rubiksdream: aren't lie algebras always contractible as manifolds?

[17:15:19] <rubiksdream> i dont think so

[17:19:19] <Fangs> 22:41 <Fangs> my thought was this: if exp: so3 -> SO(3) is surjective, then so3 ~= R^3 is a covering map. morever its a universal cover, but the universal cover of SO(3) is SU(2) (homeo to S^3)
[17:19:48] <Fangs> my claim here was that so3, if exp were a covering map, would be a universal cover
[17:20:10] <rubiksdream> oh i didnt see so3 ~= R^3, sorry
[17:20:27] <Fangs> its fine, its annoying to read lie algebra/lie group notation
[17:20:28] <rubiksdream> yes you are right, *if* exp were a covering map
[17:20:39] <Fangs> and in physics they dont even make the distinction, often
[17:20:44] <rubiksdream> then indeed, R^3 would be *the* universal cover of SO(3)
[17:20:57] <rubiksdream> yes this line of logic works
[17:21:08] <rubiksdream> so exp : so3 -> SO(3) cannot be a covering map
[17:21:12] <rubiksdream> (although it is surjective)
[17:21:13] <Fangs> idk what bullshit I spouted about SO(3) not being simply connected though, that's entirely false
[17:21:31] <Fangs> rubiksdream: yeah thats the correction I learnt after the discussion with buster
[17:21:59] <Fangs> (for S^1.. and abelian lie groups.. which is just S^1 x S^1 x ... x S^1) the exp map happens to be a covering map too

[19:57:06] <qergle> they're playing loose with notation

[20:02:43] <[-_-]> hmmm
[20:03:04] <biberao> hi
[20:03:07] <qergle> then we'd have W = ∫ kx dx (with limits being the two displacements)

[20:05:03] <qergle> i am not sure on the terminology (restoring, etc) but if a spring has constant "k", and if you stretch it "x" from rest, the force exerted is -kx.
[20:05:29] <qergle> that's my F. is that restoring force? seems like it fits since it's the force needed to go back to rest.
[20:05:37] <hanif> 'My problem is if dx' is the distance then F should be equal to k*dx'' => dx' is not the extension of the spring, rather here it means an infinitesimal change in the extension. F is a function of the entire extension (from equilibrium)

[20:13:10] <hanif> so we can follow your thought process
[20:13:41] <qergle> often we will denote the inner integral as kx (bc the limits are 0 and x)
[20:13:52] <[-_-]> small change in extension means small change in force....
[20:13:54] <qergle> but yes, technically, it can be ∫∫ kdxdx

[20:22:28] <qergle> ok, before i go, let me add a graphical dimension. say you plotted F(x) on graph paper. so x on the x-axis and F(x) is the vertical distance at each x. if you want work from x=a to x=b you want the area under the curve. in other words, you want to add up the little forces from a to a+Δ then a+Δ to a+2*Δ, etc. like you did back when you did the trapezoid approx. the limit of this as your partition shrinks is the riemann integral, denoted: ∫ F(x)dx

[22:43:10] <coeus> I've tried substitution but for some reason it's not working out
[22:43:36] <rex> I meant what solutions and what area
[22:43:36] <rubiksdream> rex precisely, this is because the connected subsets of R are exactly the intervals , so the largest connected subset of R containing the initial time for which there is a solution is the maximal existence interval, and it is necessarily open
[22:44:12] <coeus> okay rex, it's x = 10, x = 5 and Area = 50
[22:44:37] <rubiksdream> well it needs to be of width pi rex, and in this case it turns out to be symmetric about t_0
[22:45:04] <rex> rubiksdream: now that makes a lot of sense; in this case one could just use facts of the tan function; is there a more general approach?
[22:46:23] <coeus> rex x_2 - x_1 = -b/a -> 10 - 5 = -b/a -> b = -15a
[22:46:55] <coeus> sorry b = -5a
[22:47:31] <rex> In last weeks homework reference solution they showed (for another de) x' < x, y' < cy and therefore x < e^t x_0, y < e^(ct) y, now they say (x,y) is bounded on finite intervals and therefore the maximal existence time is ∞
[22:47:40] *** Joins: node1 (~node1@user/node1)
[22:47:50] <rex> rubiksdream: I don't get the last reasoning
[22:48:27] <rex> coeus: ok so you want ∫_5^10 ax^2 + bx + c dx = 50 ?
[22:48:31] <rubiksdream> rex in general, suppose the ODE is x'  = f(t,x), where f : D \subset R \times R^n -> R^n, (and f is sufficiently nice so that there are unique solutions for all initial values (t_0,x_0) \in D), then the maximal solution (defined on the maximal existence interval) needs to either explode as t approaches the ends of the interval, or the solution (t,x(t)) has to converge to the boundary of D at the endpoints of the maximal existence interval
[22:48:59] <rubiksdream> when D is just R \times R^n there is no boundary, so you know you have a maximal solution if it explodes at the endpoints
[22:49:36] <coeus> rex, yes
[22:50:30] <rex> rubiksdream: I see
[22:50:39] <rex> coeus: any other requirements?
[22:50:47] <coeus> nope
[22:50:56] <coeus> it's a hard one right
[22:50:56] <rubiksdream> oh, I should add, what I said (about explosion/convergence to boundary) only holds when the maximal existence interval is finite (at the endpoint we are interested in)
[22:51:09] <rubiksdream> that is if the endpoint is finite, then one of these things needs to happen
[22:51:24] <rubiksdream> if neither of these things happen, it means the maximum existence interval has infinite endpoint(s)
[22:51:35] <rubiksdream> so for your last weeks homework problem, that is precisely why the reasoning works
[22:51:49] <rubiksdream> if the maximum existence interval were finite, the solution needs to blow up
[22:51:55] <rubiksdream> since it doesn't , its infinite
[22:52:03] <rex> coeus: well it's one equation with three unknowns, so there are infinitely many solutions
[22:52:11] <rex> rubiksdream: now that makes a lot of sense
[22:52:33] <rex> is there a theorem about this, where I can read up on it?
[22:53:19] <rex> coeus: but it's 1/3 a (10^3 - 5^3) + 1/2 b(10^2 - 5^2) + c (10 - 5) = 50
[22:53:54] <rubiksdream> rex yes there is, see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation#Global_uniqueness_and_maximum_domain_of_solution
[22:54:00] <rubiksdream> that is the exact result i just stated

[23:36:19] <rex> so there is a choice for β if ψ,y ≠ 0
[23:36:25] <nejimban> yeah
[23:36:30] <nejimban> this trick :)
[23:36:39] <rex> biberao: orange :)
[23:36:44] *** Quits: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:37:10] <nejimban> rex: super trick of analysis: (g(b) - g(a))/(b-a) = ∫₀¹g'(a + s*(b-a))ds
[23:37:36] <a__> ok i think this genuinely works now, let t_1 = inf{psi(t) >= y(t)}. Then note that psi'(t_1) >= y'(t_1) because psi(t_1) - psi(t) / (t_1 - t) >= y(t_1) - y(t) / (t_1 - t) for t <t_1, this is a contradiction, since psi'(t_1) < f(t_1,psi(t_1)) = f(t_1,y(t_1)) = y'(t_1)

[23:38:27] <biberao> i want to learn integration and differential equations
[23:38:42] <a__> rex hopefully ive not made a brain fart like last time
[23:38:49] *** a__ is now known as rubiksdream
[23:38:57] *** Quits: rubiksdream (~a@cm61-15-252-242.hkcable.com.hk) (Changing host)
[23:38:57] *** Joins: rubiksdream (~a@user/rubiksdream)
[23:39:10] <rex> this renaming explains a lot :)
[23:41:35] <rubiksdream> *it should be " because psi(t_1) - psi(t) / (t_1 - t) > y(t_1) - y(t) / (t_1 - t) for t<t_1, taking t->t_1^{-} this gives psi'(t_1) >= y'(t_1) "
[23:42:02] <rubiksdream> but this is a contradiction because ... "use ODE equation" -> psi'(t_1) < y'(t_1)
[23:42:13] *** Quits: sebastianos (~sebastian@user/sebastianos) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:42:24] <nejimban> so β(t) = ∫₀¹g'(y(t) + s*(ψ(t)-y(t)))ds where g(x) = f(t,x), I guess
[23:42:39] <rubiksdream> but im sure you can use gronwall for this
[23:43:03] <nejimban> then z(t) = ψ(t) - y(t) fulfills z'(t) < β(t)z(t)
[23:43:04] <rex> rubiksdream: It looks right, I'm latexing it, then I can see it more clearly
[23:43:06] <rubiksdream> its just ive lost practice with using that inequality so i just opted for attempting something simpler
[23:43:41] *** Joins: sebastianos (~sebastian@user/sebastianos)
[23:43:42] <nejimban> so by Gronwall z(t) < z(0) e^(∫…) with z(0) < 0
[23:43:59] <nejimban> *z(a), rather
[23:44:07] <rubiksdream> oh wait a sec i recognize nejimban
[23:44:19] <nejimban> ?
[23:44:24] <rubiksdream> you're the one who answered my SE question on the space of test functions :D
[23:44:37] <nejimban> uhuh
[23:44:52] <nejimban> yeah you probably posted the link here
[23:45:08] <nejimban> :)
[23:45:22] <rubiksdream> this one https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4079251/topology-of-space-of-test-functions-and-convergence haha
[23:45:27] <rubiksdream> yeah i must have
[23:46:30] <nejimban> that was also a refreshing topology exercise for me :p
[23:46:56] <rubiksdream> yeah it was kinda fun

[23:55:03] <rex> biberao: if you hurry you can write my exam on 28th :)
[23:55:20] <rex> although only one half is differential equations
[23:55:58] <nejimban> rex: “fundamental theorem of analysis”
[23:56:04] <Batzy> rex you're writing the exam?
[23:56:13] <Batzy> are we allowed to contribute questions
[23:56:16] <nejimban> err, “fundamental theorem of calculus”
[23:56:36] <rex> Sorry german english translation mistake :) I'm taking the exam
[23:57:03] <rex> In German the students write the exam, and the teachers make them :)
[23:57:37] <rex> In English the students take the exam and the teachres write them right?
[23:58:21] <rex> nejimban: I meant this formula in particular
[23:58:36] <cherim> I think the stragngest variation of this modality is how Indians say they "give contests" when they participate in them
[23:59:06] <biberao> rex: im in
[23:59:16] <biberao> do i get treats?
[23:59:56] <rex> I doubt it; but if you come early enough you get a mask :)
