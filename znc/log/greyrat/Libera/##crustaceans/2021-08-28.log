[02:37:48] <manicennui> I finished FMA: Brotherhood. What a great show.
[02:38:22] <Brekkjern> Indeed it is
[02:38:26] <Brekkjern> Now I kinda want to watch it again...
[02:39:26] <manicennui> Netflix does a pretty damn good job of skipping the intros and credits, and not skipping the credits if there are scenes during or after the credits.
[02:40:18] <manicennui> Is there any other streaming service that comes close to Netflix from an app/playback experience?
[02:44:38] <manicennui> FMA:B had such a satisfying ending.
[02:52:19] <ngoldbaum> ayyy finally have a real isp
[02:52:27] <ngoldbaum> 870 megabits to netflix
[02:54:14] <manicennui> I was curious what speed is required to stream 4k. According to Netflix it is 25Mbps.
[02:55:04] <manicennui> They do qualify it with "steady".
[02:55:05] <Brekkjern> It's really not that much
[02:55:18] <Brekkjern> It's fascinating how "little" that is
[02:55:40] <manicennui> It's amazing how much that was around 2000.
[02:55:55] <manicennui> When a T1 was considered pretty fast, and a DS3 was out of this world fast.
[02:58:20] <manicennui> If I had one complaint about FMA:B, it would be the amount of yelling from Edward and May.
[02:59:02] <ngoldbaum> netflix compresses their video to shit
[02:59:22] <ngoldbaum> i have to try really hard not to notice the artifacts on a smooth background
[03:02:05] <manicennui> Oh good. They are making another Jurassic World sequel.
[03:02:20] <manicennui> Because two shitty movies weren't enough.
[03:03:41] <dimadima> prussian: i was jk to be clear
[03:05:10] <dimadima> (why crickets?)
[03:05:59] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: Same. I vastly prefer using Plex and having proper bluray rips, but sometimes the content is only available on Netflix
[03:06:35] <manicennui> A lot of anime seems to be no longer published in the US.
[03:06:51] <manicennui> On physical media that is.
[03:07:33] <prussian> dimadima: no one responded for like 15 minutes. Was playing into the joke.
[03:07:35] <prussian> Simple
[03:07:36] <manicennui> FMA:B and the first Evangelion rebuild movie are super expensive on blu ray because they aren't making more copies for some reason.
[03:07:58] <Xe> pirate that bitch
[03:08:30] <Brekkjern> The Swedish Library is open 24/7

[14:01:47] <pja> Just returning to the bitrate conversation ... IIRC Bluray 4k Bitrate is ~100MBit.  Netflix’s 4k has less bandwidth than a 1080p blu ray.
[14:05:26] <pja> Netflix has always been the “it’s good enough” of streaming services :) IIRC Apple TV uses the highest bitrate of the streaming services.

[23:22:41] <prussian> indigo: powerful
[23:22:51] <prussian> better than what I do currently.
[23:23:17] <indigo> It's surprisingly easy to set up systemd units with docker services
[23:23:24] <prussian> one of the big reasons I got so deep into node.js was just being able to run `yarn install` and my crap magically executed on my server without me doing anything
[23:23:35] <prussian> really?
[23:23:49] <prussian> I thought docker interfered with systemd's cgrouping
[23:23:59] <prussian> does docker still not do cgroupsv2:
[23:24:19] <prussian> last I tried doing docker systemd service units, it would hang trying to shut the container down.

[23:29:25] <buttsbot> GitHub - ibuildthecloud/systemd-docker: Wrapper for "docker run" to handle systemd quirks
[23:29:48] <prussian> maybe that is even better?
[23:31:55] <indigo> My existing solution works for me
[23:32:05] <indigo> Not sure why this is better
[23:33:20] <prussian> it basically moves the container's cgroup under systemd's purview
[23:33:41] <prussian> idk if this works for cgroupsv2 since it is single writer only and systemd takes it exclusively
[23:35:30] <prussian> I guess docker v20.10 supports v2
[23:36:27] <indigo> What the benefit of moving cgroups?
[23:36:51] <prussian> systemd shouldn't do that "waiting for stop job to run..... 2min blah blah"
[23:37:00] <prussian> but if what you posted works... damn.
[23:37:07] <prussian> it never worked well for me.
