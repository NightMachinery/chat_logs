[00:04:01] <sawgood> ah: see these are on phones:  and all 20 are fine now as VPN-clients: but someone could take the .OVPN file and put it on a Windows PC using the client software and become the 21st client
[00:15:11] <rob0> yes, or on any support OS
[00:15:39] <sawgood> yeah: that is what I was thinking too

[14:25:42] <pingufan> Hello
[14:27:06] <pingufan> I kindly want to ask how to solve a problem with openvpn client on Android. It tells me now SSL_CA_MD_TOO_WEAK  
[14:29:15] <pingufan> This appears to be only on Android, other openvpn connections still work.  So I assume this is bug in the Android client?   How can I get it operational again without any changes on server side?
[14:29:22] <pingufan> Please, help.
[14:34:21] <pingufan> Actually I am looking for a method to force the openvpn client for Android to work as it did in the past, using the certs and keys already installed.
[15:20:20] <BtbN> It's telling you your certificates suck
[15:21:09] <BtbN> MD_TOO_WEAK means "You're using md5 or something similarly weak, so your certs are trivially attacked, use something actually secure"
[15:23:32] <pingufan> And how can I tell openvpn client to shut up and accept what I give it?
[15:26:19] <BtbN> You can't, that's the underlying SSL library refusing to use those dangerous certs.
[15:26:41] <BtbN> Modern OpenSSL on Desktop will likewise refuse it
[15:26:47] <BtbN> you need to update those certs
[15:27:58] <pingufan> I cannot roll out new certs etc  Too many users without any experience
[15:28:25] <BtbN> You're out of luck then
[15:29:13] <pingufan> No option in android to ignore this?
[15:29:25] <BtbN> No
[15:29:36] <BtbN> Like I just said, that error is not coming from OpenVPN
[15:29:57] <BtbN> Not sure what exactly the issues with those certs is (md5 hashes probably?), but it must have been broken and dangerous to use for probably the better part of a decade. You had plenty of time to fix it, and now it bites you.
[15:31:49] <pingufan> I love such things. Adding something without an option to disable it.
[15:32:07] <BtbN> Nothing was added
[15:32:17] <BtbN> The support for those ancient algorithms has been plain removed
[15:32:27] <BtbN> And it was warned about for easily 5 years or more
[15:32:50] <BtbN> You also seem to underestimate how dangerous using that is
[15:32:54] <BtbN> it's trivial to attack
[15:33:15] <pingufan> but in this case the change was done only in Android.
[15:33:38] <pingufan> Linux to Linux is still working, OSX to Linux also.
[15:35:15] <BtbN> You're probably using an old openssl version on those then
[15:35:28] <pingufan> 1 year?
[15:35:34] <BtbN> If it's really MD5, that's gone since OpenSSL 1.1
[15:37:00] <pingufan> It is 1.1.0
[15:37:08] <BtbN> "The security level corresponds to a minimum of 80 bits of security. Any parameters offering below 80 bits of security are excluded. As a result RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 1024 bits and ECC keys shorter than 160 bits are prohibited. All export cipher suites are prohibited since they all offer less than 80 bits of security. SSL version 2 is prohibited. Any cipher suite using MD5 for the MAC is also prohibited."
[15:37:12] <BtbN> From the OpenSSL docs
[15:37:53] <pingufan> 'openssl version'
[15:38:19] <pingufan> On Linux.
[15:39:06] <BtbN> Either your version is barely old enough to not have them removed yet, or your distro patched them back in.
[15:39:18] <BtbN> In either case, your only way forward is to update the certs to modern standards.
[15:40:19] <pingufan> I created this certs with easyrsa
[15:40:55] <BtbN> You either did so a very long time ago, or used a very old version of easyrsa
[15:42:10] <pingufan> Yes
[15:43:10] <pingufan> But I use 2048 Bit 
[15:44:29] <BtbN> With which hash algorithm?
[15:47:22] <pingufan> Where do I see this?
[15:51:05] <pingufan> SHA1 it is
[15:51:53] <BtbN> Yeah, SHA1 has been broken.
[15:51:58] <BtbN> You ant sha256 at the minimum
[15:52:03] <BtbN> *want
[15:52:14] <pingufan> "Wonderful"
[15:52:35] <BtbN> sha1 was also removed later than 1.1 I think
[15:53:18] <pingufan> How do I cwitch over with minimal work?   Is there a step-by-step description?
[15:53:41] <BtbN> You basically just roll an entire new CA from scratch
[15:54:07] <BtbN> The only way to "gradually" migrate is to start a second OpenVPN instance, and hand out new configs + certs to people for that, and over time retire the old one
[15:54:49] <BtbN> Before you do that, you should also make sure that your cert settings are "state of the art", so you don't run into the same issue again next year
[15:55:03] <pingufan> So I can use the old scripts of easyrsa, enter there perhaps a few changes, and start from scratch?
[15:55:36] <BtbN> I'd very much recommend to use the latest version of easyrsa, and hope it has more modern settings by default
[15:56:36] <BtbN> Probably want to look into EC crypto as well
[15:56:53] <pingufan> I remember that I tried a newer easyrsa and it made issues. So I finally used the previous one because I was under pressure to get it work.
