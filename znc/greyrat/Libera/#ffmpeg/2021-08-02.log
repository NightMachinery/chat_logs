[00:56:50] <EmberCrest> JEEB: yo! so I continue to successfully use the command you helped me come up with yesterday..
[00:57:31] <EmberCrest> interestingly, after a whole day of streaming, the speed of that particular subtitle-capable command is 1.2x (on it owns it averages out at 0.7x)
[00:58:43] <EmberCrest> so basically.. i stream different shows (without any filters) at a constant-rate speed (-re)
[00:59:23] <EmberCrest> then that subtitle-enabled command WITHOUT -re averages a 1.2x speed
[01:00:01] <EmberCrest> thus the side-effect is that the subtitle-enabled command actually skips forward MORE than the shows using -re.
[01:04:46] <JEEB> I think you want to re-read my last lines which you seemingly completely ignored

[01:11:30] <EmberCrest> I doubt I have them anymore but I wasn't lodging any kind of complaint? just wanted to further the discussion
[01:11:33] <EmberCrest> jesus lol.
[01:13:47] <EmberCrest> and I did read your explanation about -re. I just continue to use it because if you don't, the streaming app *will* skip to the latest HLS streampart. filter_complex's slowness seems to justify the lack of the -re flag in subtitles.
[01:21:55] <JEEB> it's not about your usage of it, the fact that there is a fix for -re logic in ffmpeg.c 4.4 branch that is not in the 4.4 release, and that's why I pointed you towards BtbN's release 4.4 branch's builds (or master) since there are no newer releases yet made from the 4.4 branch
[01:22:22] <JEEB> since apparently you were using Gyan's 4.4 build which I would guess is from the release tag
[01:36:42] <EmberCrest> right. no i got that part-- I understand -re isn't working in my version

[08:57:41] <aphysically> .....nope doesn't work
[08:58:36] <aphysically> even though the mkvmerge output results in files with subtitles that play out over the entire sequence, when I try to use that file to render out hardsubs they stop displaying after the first file just like with ffmpeg's concat demuxer
[08:59:15] <aphysically> so however mkvmerge is combining ASS subtitles it's good enough for mpv just not for ffmpeg, I guess
[08:59:46] <aphysically> I mean there *could* be bugs in ffmpeg causing this, but it seems more likely it's just creating some out of spec file subtitle stream in one way or another that causes ffmepg to choke
[09:00:16] <aphysically> (context: I'm concatenating subtitle streams in alternative ways since concat demuxing them in ffmpeg isn't working)
[09:04:15] <aphysically> whatever makes ffmpeg stop decoding the mkvmerge (or ffmpeg) concatenated ASS subtitle streams at the origin file boundary margin is bizarre: if I don't try to start the ffmpeg hardsub code from the start and I instead seek to some time in the middle of the first file then ffmpeg WILL be able to render subs past the former file boundary
[09:13:50] <aphysically> mmmmmmmmmmmmm let's try sanitizing the subtitle stream by running it through ffmpeg's encoder by specifying -c:s ass instead of -c copy and if that doesn't work I give up :P

[13:36:18] <aphysically> if you feed the subtitles filter a concat demuxing script*
[13:36:53] <aphysically> so that's another dead end :D
[13:40:28] <JEEB> subtitles filter literally slurps all subtitle packets from the input avformat context it creates, and feeds it to libass if you look at vf_subtitles
[13:41:17] <aphysically> I was actually pretty sure the concat demuxing script was going to work, that surprised me
[13:42:11] <aphysically> actually maybe that's the problem and this is impossible -> libass can't handle being fed a new ASS header in the middle?

[14:06:44] <aphysically> JEEB: what was that option to show packets as they're being read -showstreams or something?
[14:07:18] <aphysically> maybe I'm confused
[14:09:33] <JEEB> -debug_ts in ffmpeg.c, but you won't see anything from the subtitles filter :P
[14:09:46] <JEEB> since it literally does reading packets and decoding them to ASS subtitles by itself
[14:09:52] <aphysically> honestly I think it's really suspicious that the mkv files w/ASS subtitles that I made by concatenating two mkv files with mkvtoolnix stopped rendering out subtitles exactly along the file boundary of my video concat demux
[14:10:31] <aphysically> because I'm pretty sure mkvtoolnix doesn't blindly concatenate them, I think it has understanding of ASS that it uses to rewrite it
[14:11:26] <aphysically> which makes me think the reason it stops rendering is some bug in ffmpeg when the regular input (not the subtitles filter input) crosses the concat demux boundary
[14:11:56] <aphysically> there's also the fact that if I seek late into the file, it doesn't stop working at the boundary anymore

[18:28:24] <furq> there's a few workarounds for it

[18:30:51] <Aelius> thanks. Another related issue is sometimes when I specify -ss and -to before -i, the resulting video has players confused about the length. Like ffmpeg didn't update the video's table, or something
[18:34:28] <furq> probably duration metadata
[18:34:45] <furq> some muxers write an optional duration tag that ffmpeg will just copy across
[18:34:53] <furq> try -metadata duration=""
[18:36:53] <Aelius> ok thanks!

[20:16:09] <roxlu> hey, what is the best way to tell ffmpeg where to find certain libraries when I want it to link against some custom versions of libs?
[20:16:53] <JEEB> if they provide pkg-config files, utilize PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/your/prefix/lib/pkgconfig
[20:17:04] <JEEB> (that appends to the search path, doesn't override it completely)
[20:17:13] <JEEB> (PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR is which overrides the search path completely)
[20:17:25] <roxlu> ok thanks!
[20:17:52] <roxlu> I think I can add multiple paths with PKG_CONFIG_PATH
[20:17:54] <JEEB> although the simplest is if you keep the development non-soname'd libraries not installed if you are not planning to utilize them
[20:18:26] <JEEB> (the stuff that the -dev packages install on debian and -devel on red hat stuff)

[20:38:21] <Aelius> I'm having a problem where I can't seen to define the framerate of a list of input images
[20:38:24] <Aelius> ffmpeg -r 24 -f concat -i list.txt...
[20:38:35] <Aelius> Stream #0:0: Video: bmp, bgr24, 1920x1080, 25 fps, 25 tbr, 25 tbn, 25 tbc
[20:39:01] <Aelius> it's just ignoring my -r 24
[20:40:01] <BtbN> Are you trying to use the concat demuxer for a series of images?
[20:41:24] <Aelius> yes, specifically because I'm trying to loop a gif by playing it in forward and reverse, and it seemed like a smart thing to do to just ls > file && ls -r >> file
[20:41:58] <Aelius> rather than trying to concoct a formula to copy all the files into reverse order name
[20:42:28] <Aelius> it works, it's just defaulting to 25fps
[20:44:25] <JEEB> the image2(pipe) readers have a "framerate" option, but it will not get passed unless the concat demuxer specifically has code for that :P
[20:45:51] <Aelius> lol dang
[20:46:00] <JEEB> I posted a patch to enable setting options for each input in concat demuxer but I haven't been able to get back to it. and then I think nicolas made his own patch set lately, so that might get in soon
[20:46:02] <DeHackEd> Sadly I think the simplest solution might be to make symlinks for the reverse animation, then just use iamge2 "normally"
[20:46:21] <JEEB> well image2pipe exists, no?
[20:46:28] <JEEB> you could just pipe the things in some order
[20:46:35] <JEEB> that supports framerate just fine IIRC
[20:47:03] <Aelius> I'll try that

[20:53:20] <Aelius> oof my bash foo is failing me. how do I pipe files in reverse order

[21:01:07] <Aelius> I ended up going through (cat files.txt) so I could more easily make non-destructive edits to the loop-seam

[21:01:22] <Aelius> well
[21:01:55] <Aelius> I mean cat files | xargs cat

[21:02:17] <AaronBurr> surprised unix never got a 'dog' command
[21:25:25] <aphysically> JEEB: I think I'll post a minimal reproducer to trac for that issue I had where feeding the subtitles filter a concat demuxed set of a files wasn't rendering them all out
[21:25:32] <aphysically> I don't think anybody is working on that kind of thing but at least it puts it out there

[21:33:35] <AaronBurr> h265 fastdecode looks way better than h264 fastdecode, and uses not much more cpu
[21:39:38] <AaronBurr> also reanscoding old sources to h265 is nice with temporal denoising and some sharpening

[21:44:40] <aphysically> Are there tools anyone recommends for inspecting an ASS stream packed inside an mkv container without demuxing it? I want to investigate that case where ffmpeg stops rendering the subtitles in a single mkv provided to the subtitles filter in an encode where the video/audio is concat demuxed (it stops at the concat demux boundary)
[21:45:30] <aphysically> the single mkv was muxed together with mkvtoolnix and if the ASS inside is valid then it's an ffmpeg bug, and if not it's probably in scope to be an mkvtoolnix bug
[21:47:36] <pagenoare> Do you guys know what flag is responsible fro mpeg-dash handling? I have ffmpeg 4.2 (https://pastebin.com/2wyhhqd9) and ffmpeg 4.4 (https://pastebin.com/i5uj7ZfQ) and 4.4 returns `Invalid data found when processing input` for DASH stream.
[21:48:09] <JEEB> aphysically: I'd just print the text field of the AVSubtitle entry
[21:49:05] <JEEB> pagenoare: DASH manifests are XML
[21:49:09] <JEEB> XML requires libxml
[21:50:04] <pagenoare> JEEB yeah I just spotted this difference, re-running the build. thanks!
[21:50:06] <aphysically> is there any chance of doing that directly with ffprobe or something or do I need to write up a small file
[21:51:06] <JEEB> aphysically: you can either do it in ffmpeg.c with an av_log after a packet is demuxed, or in the subtitle filter where it goes through the packets
[21:51:11] <JEEB> no real new file needed
[21:52:04] <JEEB> just an av_log(thing, AV_LOG_VERBOSE, "Le text: %s\n", pkt->data);
[21:52:18] <JEEB> (note that generally logging the data of an AVPacket is not a Good Idea)
[21:52:27] <JEEB> but for ass streams that should be OK

[22:29:48] <aphysically> JEEB: okay, so in mkv ASS subtitles have associated numbers that indicate their order (ONLY in mkv !! not if you demux it), and mkvtoolnix doesn't adjust these numbers when appending two files
[22:30:08] <aphysically> so naively I wouldn't call the appended ASS stream mkvtoolnix outputs valid
[22:30:35] <aphysically> devs in #matroska say this is in scope to fix in mkvtoolnix, but this does suggest a workaround -> demux and remux it

[23:47:46] <aphysically> this probably wouldn't be a problem with sending ffconcat files directly to the vf_subtitles, but that fails for unknown reasons (I should probably still file that as bug in ffmpeg)
