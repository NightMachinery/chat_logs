[04:58:03] <Hash> I got questions like
[04:58:17] <Hash> What size block does FORK256 use?
[04:58:22] <Hash> RFC 1321 describes what hash?
[04:58:27] <Hash> What is a salt?
[04:58:30] <Hash> LOL
[04:58:41] <Hash> This algorithm was published by the German engineering firm Siemens in 1993. It is a software based stream cipher using Lagged Fibonacci generator along with a concept borrowed from the shrinking generator ciphers.
[04:58:53] <Hash> Which of the following is a stream cipher that uses variable length key from 1 to 256 bytes?
[04:58:57] <Hash> Anyway
[04:59:07] <Hash> This is cool stuff i didn't knew before
[04:59:14] <maroon> it's a somewhat unique/random string that's combined with a password so that the encryption key is different for each message
[04:59:16] <Hash> The course wants you to take a assessment test to seee wher eyou stand
[04:59:56] <Hash> What is the formula Me%n related to? 
[05:00:06] <Hash> I have no idea. Haha. After this quiz I can start the course
[05:00:07] <maroon> like if the password for each message is HMAC(salt,same-key), and if the salt is different each time, the password is almost certainly different each time
[05:00:25] <Hash> I know not much about cryptography but omg it sounds like fun
[05:00:32] <Hash> so far the course outline I love it
[05:00:35] <maroon> salt adds flavor to your encryption
[05:00:40] <Hash> yup
[05:00:44] <Hash> that one i know
[05:00:49] <Hash> password hashing, salting peppering
[05:01:04] <maroon> salt is similar to a nonce, but not quite the same
[05:04:08] <Hash> https://i.imgur.com/E4Ye1bI.png
[05:04:18] <Hash> look at my result
[05:04:21] <Hash> :(
[05:04:53] <Hash> Need 85% or higher
[05:05:38] <ericonr> > FORK-256 is a hash algorithm designed in response to security issues discovered in the earlier SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms. After substantial cryptanalysis, the algorithm is considered broken. 
[05:05:50] <Hash> *nod*
[05:05:54] <Hash> I'm starting on chapter 1 now :)
[05:06:00] <ericonr> why is this considered relevant knowledge lmao
[05:06:04] <Hash> I'm so excited I can't even contain myself
[05:06:07] <Hash> omg!
[05:06:20] <Hash> I dunno, I guess they want you know history
[05:06:27] <Hash> History is good to know/learn.
[05:06:32] <ericonr> "this hash is broken and shouldn't be used. please input its block size which you obviously should know from memory"
[05:06:47] <ericonr> yeah but it makes no sense to memorize history
[05:06:51] <ericonr> especially details like that
[05:06:59] <Hash> I know.
[05:07:30] <Hash> Yes! I have completed the exam. It took me about 20 minutes for 50 questions. Easy! Just make sure you know the history of listed ciphers, block sizes, key sizes, block cipher modes (5 or 6 of them I think?, they are definitely tested on), and which algorithms are symmetric, asymmetric, or hashes.
[05:07:34] <Hash> Someone online said ^

[22:36:39] <srmo> Ahoi! I'm having a hard time udnerstanding and implementing my own padding oracle attack against AEC/CBC/PKCS7 in a intro CTF (overthewire). I have the code that queries the webserver and parses the repsonse for a padding error. The ciphertext I'm using has 80bytes. It is assumed, that blocksize is 16.
[22:41:12] <srmo> Now, I'm usnure what to do. I've chosen one approach, where I prepend a new block, all zeros and iterate the last byte from 1-255, on non-error, I iterate the previous byte. but this leads to non padding errors immidiately and so the result claims to be 0x01 for all 16 bytes. 
[22:44:41] <srmo> Another approach is, that I chose the N-1th block, set its bytes to zero and start iterating its last byte. Similar behaiour. I have actually no idea what I'm doing. I tried to understand the attack, but got probably at most 50% of it. I understand the general concept of CBC but having a hard time abstracting from the attack examples, often using
[22:44:42] <srmo> only 2 blocks.

[22:51:22] <Alipha> srmo: apply the attack examples to the last two blocks.
[22:52:26] <Alipha> srmo: your second approach should work
[22:53:55] <srmo> Let me try this again. So I'm going to take the last 2 blocks, set the first of those blocks to all 0 and start iterating.
[22:55:39] <Alipha> srmo: you may want to iterate all 256 possible values for the last block just for your own experimentation. Perhaps it just so happens that the first value you try ends up making the plaintext end with 0x1
[22:56:06] <wasamasa> srmo: what makes you think it's the padding oracle
[22:56:18] <wasamasa> srmo: there are a lot more attacks on block ciphers than that particular one
[22:57:18] <Alipha> And typically, from what I've seen of a padding oracle attack implementation, you don't zero out the 2nd to last block, but just increment the byte values from their current value. But I don't think it makes a difference
[22:58:35] <srmo> wasamasa: good question. It's a beginner ctf, current section webserver attacks. The server responds with a page stating "pkcs7 padding wrong" for some queries. The query is a http param, base64, which decodes to binary data.
[22:58:42] <wasamasa> it's not a CTF either, lol
[22:58:53] <srmo> What makes you say that?
[22:59:38] <wasamasa> several things, such as playing actual CTFs, finishing a bunch of wargames on that site and becoming chanop on the OTW IRC network
[23:00:09] <wasamasa> I'm the guy giving people hints when they get stuck on any natas level
[23:00:17] <wasamasa> and my hint to you is to take a step back
[23:01:27] <srmo> Sweet.
[23:01:49] <wasamasa> in an actual CTF, it's a no-go to ask for hints
[23:01:52] <wasamasa> they're timeboxed
[23:02:01] <srmo> Ok.
[23:02:16] <wasamasa> they're highly competitive and best played in teams
[23:02:35] <wasamasa> if you're lucky, you can use them to qualify for more prestigious CTF events
[23:02:39] <wasamasa> or even win prizes
[23:03:00] <wasamasa> and then publish write-ups, once the CTF is over
[23:03:09] <wasamasa> wargames are pretty much the opposite of all these points
[23:03:22] <srmo> Well, then I'm playing a wargame.
[23:03:27] <srmo> Thanks for the clarification.
[23:03:29] <yawkat> "in an actual CTF, it's a no-go to ask for hints" uhh
[23:03:35] <yawkat> depends on the ctf.
[23:04:20] <wasamasa> I deliberately exclude the lowest of low CTFs, where it's pure guessing skill and the challenge design is so bad you need to ask
[23:04:34] <yawkat> nice gatekeeping dude
[23:05:03] <wasamasa> you're welcome
[23:06:07] <wasamasa> if you encounter yourself in such a thing, here's a highly useful tool: https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey
[23:09:33] <srmo> Thing is, the error messages I can get both hint at aes padding oracle, "Invalid PKCS#7 padding encountered" and "Incorrect amount of PKCS#7 padding for blocksize". Both seem to come php's mcrypt
[23:09:43] <wasamasa> nuh-uh
[23:09:55] <wasamasa> that does not mean it's CBC
