[00:00:28] <kubblai> atm my confidence/skill is very low so anything i do around go is all good. I had already worked out i need an actual project and you guys confirmed it
[00:00:46] <rawtaz> indeed
[00:00:58] <rawtaz> try to think of some little tool that you'd find useful to have in your daily work
[00:02:05] <kubblai> a robot that goes to the toilet for me and brings me tea?
[00:03:46] <kwilczynski> You make tea out of toilet water?
[00:03:51] <kwilczynski> :) 
[00:04:12] <kwilczynski> kubblai: Try tap. Might taste better! :P
[00:04:24] * kwilczynski hides... :P
[00:04:29] <lantech19446> but where would it get its pretty brown shade from then?
[00:05:05] <kwilczynski> Hmm. Cocoa substitute?
[00:05:06] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:05:13] <kwilczynski> I am improvising here!
[00:06:25] <kubblai> momma's special hot chocolate
[00:06:55] <lantech19446> lol
[00:07:34] <kwilczynski> OK. I will be quiet. I am sorry.
[00:07:44] <kwilczynski> I've been a bad influence.

[01:08:16] <slaughter> Y'all ever debug rails Rspec test? Woo buddy tracking down things following this is just silly: [1:4:1:2:1:1:1,1:4:1:2:1:3:1,1:4:1:2:1:4:1] 
[01:09:55] <kwilczynski> What are we looking at?
[01:10:01] * kwilczynski wipes his glasses...
[01:10:10] <kwilczynski> slaughter: It looks like numbers from LOST.
[01:10:11] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:10:24] <slaughter> Appropraite, because I am lost af
[01:11:36] <rawtaz> yeah what is that? is it output from rails?
[01:11:39] <slaughter> So in a ruby test file, you'd have your `describe ... do` - that's the first number, which of those outer blocks you're looking at. Within that, you'd have `context ... do` - that's the second number, which of that group you're looking at. Then you have the next block. Really not sure what the next 3 is 
[01:11:41] <kwilczynski> slaughter: What's the problem?
[01:12:32] * rawtaz wonders why one would ever have to look at those numbers
[01:12:33] <kwilczynski> Flaky test? Failing test? Odd behaviour? Should not execute test?
[01:12:33] <slaughter> So that first one before the comma is "first group, fourth child group, first example" and then I don't know what 2:1:1:1 is, since in this case there's no further nesting
[01:12:41] <slaughter> kwilczynski flaky tests!
[01:13:12] <slaughter> Rspec has a --bisect feature that will run your tests in batches when one fails to try to track down the preceeding tests that are likely causing problems
[01:13:19] <slaughter> It's really cool but this output is horrid
[01:14:16] <slaughter> rawtaz I'm trying to fix our flaky tests, or at least identify them. So I have to dig into the spec (test) files based on those crazy numbers to find the actual test that's probably not resetting a DB connection or something odd
[01:14:23] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Are you not using the verbose? --bisect=verbose
[01:14:33] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Otherwise this will drive you mad.
[01:14:36] <slaughter> Well shit
[01:14:43] <slaughter> Only took an hour and a half to run the first time
[01:14:46] <slaughter> What's another hour and a half
[01:15:10] <kwilczynski> LOL
[01:15:21] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Also, even default output from --bisect isn't that nerve wrecking. :)
[01:15:37] <kwilczynski> Not sure what or how this got so compressed down.
[01:15:52] <kwilczynski> Normally it's just the "Round 1 ..."
[01:15:59] <kwilczynski> And then it tells you possible candidates, etc.
[01:16:02] <slaughter> This was after round 58
[01:16:17] <slaughter> And that example isn't even the worst one
[01:17:19] <kwilczynski> You can try adding `--order defined` to force it to run as-is in the spec file.
[01:17:30] <kwilczynski> Not sure how much verbose and order can help with your case.
[01:17:32] <kwilczynski> ;-S
[01:17:50] <slaughter> My understanding was that it needed to use --seed with a constant number to verify order dependency
[01:18:05] <slaughter> Since `defined` doesn't guarantee order of child groups and examples
[01:18:26] <kwilczynski> --seed 123 is the same as --rand:123, indeed.
[01:18:58] <kwilczynski> slaughter: I have a perfect talk for you about testing and quality.

[01:19:17] <kwilczynski> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7vy2Atgks
[01:19:27] <kwilczynski> Highly recommended :)
[01:19:46] <rawtaz> lol seems watchable
[01:20:01] <kwilczynski> It's quite fun.
[01:20:34] <rawtaz> if anyone wants a *serious* talk on testing, here's one of the absolutely best presentations i have ever seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM
[01:21:15] <slaughter> I'd love a talk on "how to fix your humongous ruby test suite"
[01:22:22] <kwilczynski> slaughter: If you pay me 50,000 USD, I will make a PowerPoint presentation about the power of rmdir for you.
[01:22:29] <slaughter> lmao
[01:22:30] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Even throw in a free workshop.
[01:22:31] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:23:02] <slaughter> So you're not a fan of testing, then?
[01:23:06] <kwilczynski> No.
[01:23:08] <kwilczynski> Not at all.
[01:23:12] <slaughter> Fair

[01:24:00] <rawtaz> but you do. they're called "users"
[01:24:07] <kwilczynski> This ^
[01:24:08] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:24:14] <rawtaz> and they dont look like [1:4:1:2:1:1:1,1:4:1:2:1:3:1,1:4:1:2:1:4:1]
[01:24:20] <rawtaz> and you can actually talk to them
[01:24:31] <kwilczynski> And they can have names like "Bob".
[01:24:33] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:24:39] <rawtaz> they will only reply with complete nonsense, and theyll always be wrong, but it's at least a break from your fricken coworkers
[01:24:42] <rawtaz> yeah
[01:24:43] <slaughter> Users leave your platform when the stuff the pay for doesn't show up
[01:24:52] <slaughter> At least, that's how it works for us

[01:25:01] <rawtaz> and when Bob does a gender change he renames himself to Bobette

[01:25:17] <rawtaz> slaughter: way too serious about this stuff
[01:25:21] <rawtaz> the worthy will stay.

[01:25:28] <slaughter> Haha fair enough
[01:25:41] <slaughter> I've just been elbow deep in this stuff for the last two weeks and I want it to be done

[01:26:03] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:26:36] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Silliness aside. Hang in there.
[01:26:52] <kwilczynski> slaughter: You can do a bit of a binary-search/bisect yourself, where possible.
[01:27:02] <slaughter> Oh I am. Just reaching for the hammer, however slowly
[01:27:12] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Comment out some tests are always pass or are trivial.
[01:27:22] <kwilczynski> To reduce runtime.
[01:27:40] <kwilczynski> And then keep commenting out. If the flaky test still causes issues, then it's the test.
[01:27:52] <kwilczynski> If it stops, then it's something from the environment influencing it.
[01:28:04] <kwilczynski> Which is then more annoying to hone onto.
[01:28:38] <slaughter> Yeah I'm working my way towards that. Just loaded up the bisect earlier
