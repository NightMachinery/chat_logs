[02:07:44] <gh555222> badassnigga: well, on Linux you can use LD_PRELOAD to overwrite system calls which would otherwise cause a DNS leak
[02:08:43] <gh555222> or you can even use the System.map file of your kernel and overwrite the section of kernel memory containing offending system calls (I did do so before, its pretty cool to have that level of power over your computer and the programs on it)

[02:40:29] <UncleKiwi> ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt 0    <----- im just wondering about this 
[02:40:41] <UncleKiwi> how it works
[02:41:54] <UncleKiwi> if there is no manual assignment in the file will it take from the pool ? 
[02:42:32] <UncleKiwi> and I know that people have mentioned that I can use a dyndns type service 
[02:43:21] <UncleKiwi> but im thinking tat in many cases this would require manual creation of the A records initially, or can this be automatic ?
[02:44:11] <UncleKiwi> im just trying to think if a way that i can manage maybe 200 or so devices
[02:44:31] <UncleKiwi> with meaningful dns

[09:07:18] <UncleKiwi> i wonder if I could create my own dns server and us that having it publically resolving names or is that a bad idea
[09:07:29] <UncleKiwi> I have actually never done that b4
[09:07:58] <UncleKiwi> is that something people even do ?
[09:26:28] <UncleKiwi> rob0: you mentioned that I might be able to use dns to help keep order to many client devices I might be maintaining that connect to the openvpn server
[09:26:48] <UncleKiwi> I'm just wondering how the names would be generated etc
[09:27:11] <UncleKiwi> im just wanting a bit of background in how you were considering this 
[09:27:24] <UncleKiwi> it sounded like a really useful idea
[09:28:38] <UncleKiwi> maybe I could generate a cert with the name eg deviceA2 - and maybe that could automatically create the dns name deviceA2.somedns.local
[09:28:48] <UncleKiwi> that could be useful

[16:23:12] <UncleKiwi> hi guys - should I be using topology subnet > 
[16:23:13] <UncleKiwi> ?>
[16:23:41] <UncleKiwi> things dont seems to work very well when I do 
[16:23:56] <UncleKiwi> not sure why 
[16:44:34] <xx> UncleKiwi: yes, you should be using topology subnet
[16:46:39] <UncleKiwi> xx: im just reading about it 
[16:47:38] <UncleKiwi> it doesnt seem to use a /30 link_net
[16:47:53] <UncleKiwi> type address 
[16:48:06] <UncleKiwi> with topolody subnet
[16:48:19] <UncleKiwi> *topology 
[16:51:14] <UncleKiwi> it seem to push a default gateway when I enabled this mode
[16:51:25] <UncleKiwi> I dont want all traffic to go across the vpn 
[16:51:40] <UncleKiwi> only routes that I push
[16:52:58] <BtbN> You always want subnet topology. The old old net30 is an ugly hack that only gives you headaches for no reason.
[16:53:24] <UncleKiwi> thanks ok i am aiming to get my setup working in that way 
[16:53:53] <UncleKiwi> I can see in the logs its pusing the default gw I dont want that 
[16:53:57] <UncleKiwi> :-/
[16:54:03] <BtbN> Don't tell it to push it then?
[16:54:10] <UncleKiwi> its not in the config
[16:54:16] <BtbN> That's highly unlikely.
[16:54:30] <UncleKiwi> ok I'll recheck
[17:04:55] <UncleKiwi> yeah ur right it said route-gateway
[17:05:56] <UncleKiwi> but still, its not working as I would expect  - my connected client get ip address 10.8.0.2
[17:06:00] <UncleKiwi> and I cant ping it 
[17:06:10] <UncleKiwi> from the server
[17:06:45] <BtbN> If that client is Windows: Windows does not reply to pings
[17:06:54] <UncleKiwi> its not windows
[17:07:15] <BtbN> Well, either it still has a restrictive firewall then, or you did something wrong.
[17:07:24] <UncleKiwi> no firewall at this point
[17:07:31] <UncleKiwi> while testing 
[17:07:55] <UncleKiwi> it works nice with the /30
[17:08:04] <UncleKiwi> just not sure what would stop it
[17:08:08] <UncleKiwi> when switching 
[17:08:31] <UncleKiwi> i dont need a masq rule aye 
[17:08:38] <UncleKiwi> surely not
[17:13:55] <UncleKiwi> could it be a limitation of the client ?
[17:14:18] <UncleKiwi> its a voip intercom
