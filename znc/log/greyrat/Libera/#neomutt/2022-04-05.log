[15:01:21] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[15:01:32] <gahr> how was the bleeding? :)
[15:02:20] <flatcap> hi gahr, successful thanks :-)
[15:02:35] <gahr> believe in coincidences? The blood center just called me this morning :)
[15:03:00] <flatcap> spooky!
[15:03:00] <gahr> but my iron is under my feet, I'll have to postpone a couple of months
[15:03:18] <gahr> yeah they're probably tapping onto this #chan
[15:03:23] <flatcap> oh dear
[15:03:26] <jindraj> how many blood donations have you already done, flatcap ?
[15:04:02] <flatcap> 106 whole blood donations (over a period of ~30 years)
[15:04:42] <flatcap> they had a session at my Uni and I've been giving ever since
[15:05:11] <jindraj> This would be a 3.rd degree Golder cross by Czech red cross  https://www.cervenykriz.eu/files/files/cz/ocenovani/ZK.jpg
[15:05:30] <flatcap> ooh!
[15:05:32] <madduck> can muchsync be told to skip downloading messages with certain tags, e.g. +spam ?
[15:06:13] <jindraj> bad picture. the 3rd degree picture leads to 1nd degree which is for 160 donations.
[15:06:17] <madduck> I don't want to download all spam to my laptop all the time.
[15:08:15] <jindraj> madduck: it seems it's not possible. at least from my findings. I just quickly skimmed through the man pages.
[15:11:12] <madduck> yeah, I did the same. I just wrote to David too.
[15:11:34] <madduck> Wonder if it's possible with the vectoring. Because it'd be quite nice to just be able to subscribe to a subset using muchsync
[15:11:37] <madduck> just imagine!
[15:11:51] <flatcap> madduck: I had a thought your mkconf script. have you considered parsing the `neomutt -D` output instead?
[15:12:21] <flatcap> `neomutt -n -F /dev/null -D` has a couple of advantages:
[15:12:35] <flatcap> its output is valid config
[15:12:49] <madduck> I have considered that, and it would make so much more sense, but I /like/ having the documentation imported too ;) 
[15:12:58] <flatcap> you can add -O to get help!  (-O -D) or (-O -Q var)
[15:13:03] <madduck> uh oh
[15:13:14] <madduck> that is very cool.
[15:13:29] <madduck> I won't be changing it now though. It's worked for years ;) 
[15:13:34] <madduck> But I'll add a comment.
[15:13:34] <flatcap> it's only one-line, but that may be enough

[16:55:43] <gour> i'd ike to integrate neomutt with etm (https://github.com/dagraham/etm-dgraham) task manager. qith notmuch/maildir-utils i can store message-id or message's full path. now i wonder if i can open neomutt by paassing such parameter and make it to select the right message?
[16:57:38] <flatcap> I think jindraj had a command-line example using ~i (match message-id)
[16:57:58] <flatcap> that relied on *you* choosing the right mailbox
[16:58:17] <flatcap> there's probably a (better) notmuch way to do it too
[16:59:59] <gour> flatcap: thank you! i'm certainly enthusiastic to learn more about it....
[17:03:34] <flatcap> neomutt -e "push '<search>~i MESSAGE-ID<enter>'"
[17:09:58] <gour> flatcap: wow! this is a real gem!! 😄
[17:10:18] * gour tried and saved for a reference 😉
[17:17:02] <flatcap> :-)
[17:18:14] <jindraj> ah, cool. no need to search or craft it :)
[17:20:58] <jindraj> gour: with notmuch you can replace it with `<vfold-from-query>id:MESSAGE-ID<enter>` - this should work everytime even if the message isn't in your default mailbox. which the example with search probably requires.
[17:21:22] <flatcap> ah! much better
[17:23:44] <jindraj> last enhancement, put <display-message> at the end to save you pressing enter :D
[17:44:40] <gour> jindraj: thanks a lot! do you possibly sync your notmuch database between two or more machines? for that reason i was also considering to use maildir-utils (mu to simplify syncing)
[17:47:36] <gour> i am also considering to use imap, then to process my inbox and use simple sarch for couple of messages i'd have to handle. the rest would be under maildir folder indexed/searchable by either mu or notmuch...that would save me from using mbsync

[17:58:24] <jindraj> gour: nope. I'm a single machine user. currently the only way is syncing the files, to do that you need to be sure there's nothing else working with the database on the other side.
[17:59:09] <gour> jindraj: are you aware of http://www.muchsync.org/ ?
[17:59:45] <jindraj> gour: perhaps you can try to replicate the underlaying xapian database, https://xapian.org/docs/replication.html ?
[18:00:27] <jindraj> I've stumbled upon it today, mentioned by madduck. It seems nice :)
[18:00:51] <jindraj> so that's another option. Too recent to remember :D
[18:01:14] <gour> mu from maildir-utils does not use tag and therefore simple usage of mbsync is enough to sync
