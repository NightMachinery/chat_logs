[06:09:57] <buttsbot> Twatter - bobpoekert - people like unit tests because they're an excuse to do work that you don't have to think too hard about, but they give you no guarantees whatsoever
[06:11:05] <manicennui> How dare you sir! Unit tests increase my test coverage!
[06:11:16] <companion_cube> don't measure your test coverage, problem solved :)
[06:12:06] <manicennui> Yeah, but test coverage means my software is good.
[06:12:21] <companion_cube> I imagine you're sarcastic right now :)
[06:12:29] <manicennui> Even if it doesn't do what the users need.
[06:12:38] <manicennui> I just tell the users, "Look at this test coverage!"
[06:25:21] <gwozniak> Unit tests are sometimes useful. Integration tests are almost always useful.
[06:30:37] <manicennui> The number of hours of machine time spent running our test suite is pretty incredible.
[06:30:49] <manicennui> And it almost never catches anything other than tests being outdated.
[06:31:39] <manicennui> My coworkers will defend it based on one time it caught something over a several month period.
[06:31:57] <manicennui> But they won't write better code.
[06:32:00] <manicennui> Just add more tests!
[06:38:54] <bontaq> tests are just a tax to pay for PR approvals :P
[07:02:47] <manicennui> Fuck flippers.

[15:25:38] <riv> i had to a do weird fix for a clang bug, to do with toolchains and defines that manage which headers get imported

[15:26:04] <riv> it works (seems to?) so im just going to not question this
[15:29:55] <riv> update: did not work :D
[15:30:09] <gerikson> this is a hot take ``So if you're looking for a document preparation system that lets you write casual text a la Markdown (or your own customized or novel syntax), then can translate that syntax into predictable markup and goes all the way to support complex document integrations with established XML tool chains, etc. etc. and can also import/produce HTML, then there's always SGML, based on an ISO
[15:30:15] <gerikson> standard even.''
[15:31:11] <riv> is that from that blog you posted?
[15:40:00] <pja> SGML.
[15:40:31] * pja raises bad memories of trying to parse broken publisher SGML on a contract job.
[15:41:12] <pja> Asciidoc is good imo. & pandoc will convert it to anything you like. Or there’s org-mode for the emacs weenies.

[16:01:45] <gerikson> not so much about stuff no-one uses
[16:03:13] <pja> True.
[16:04:01] <gerikson> I'm more and more unsderstanding why Gruber wantedd nothing to do with commonmark

[16:04:43] <gerikson> wtf
[16:08:38] <pja> Yes, I wouldn’t use CommmonMark. The problem with Markdown is that it’s too underspecified to be really useful imo. So absolutely everyone extends it & makes their own decisions about how to parse the underspecified bits then all those extensions are mutually incompatible. Or at least that used to be the case?
[16:23:08] <prussian> we must return to reStructuredText
[16:25:42] <gwozniak> I've yet to meet a markup language I really liked
[16:26:38] <gerikson> I kinda liked LaTeX
[16:26:41] <gerikson> but I was young
[16:26:45] <pja> AsciiDoc is DocBook XML, but without XML tag horribleness. A much better option for longer documents imo.
[16:27:05] <pja> People who try and wrangle Markdown into a book are insane.
[16:30:55] <gwozniak> gerikson: I appreciate LaTeX, but it's a bear to work with
[16:31:26] <gwozniak> I can't see using Markdown to write a book
[16:31:41] <gwozniak> I wrote a thesis and there's no way I'd have used Markdown for it
[16:35:03] <gerikson> yeah there are dark corners of LaTex

[17:51:46] <companion_cube> gwozniak: maybe with cmark and an implementation designed to be modified / extended, then it's ok for a book probably (expecting to write your own constructs for your needs)

[19:27:57] <gwozniak> If the Canadian government really wanted to make a dent, they could ban cryptocurrencies
[19:28:10] <edk> this is tricky tbh
[19:29:07] <edk> i've tended to support the right of XR and other environmental protest groups to do things that are illegal
[19:29:52] <gwozniak> There have been many such protests here in the past.  They usually blockade something not so public
[19:30:24] <gwozniak> Indigenous land supporters, environmentalists, etc. block things like roads to logging areas, pipelines, etc.
[19:30:33] <edk> yeah
[19:30:42] <gwozniak> Shutting down an whole city is a different matter
[19:31:02] <edk> it does feel like a different matter to me but i can't help but wonder if that's because i agree with one group and not the other
[19:31:13] <gwozniak> And the horns thing was just a pure nuisance
[19:31:21] <edk> well yes
[19:31:59] <gwozniak> I'm on the side of the Indigenous land supporters most of the time, but I'm always squeamish about their road blockades
[19:32:31] <edk> i've definitely defended road blockade protests before
[19:32:55] <gwozniak> There was one time a few years ago they blockaded trains.  That pissed a lot of people off
[19:33:00] <edk> not that i think they should be legal, but i don't think we should be throwing the protesters in jail
[19:33:22] <gwozniak> Most of these people will be fined heavily, I expect.  It will take a while
[19:33:45] <gwozniak> Given the scale of this one, I think they will be going after the organizers hard
[19:33:57] <edk> to some extent fines are just saying crime is less bad if you have money
[19:34:10] <gwozniak> Yeah
[19:34:26] <gwozniak> But I agree that throwing them in jail isn't a great option
[19:34:40] <gwozniak> Many will likely lose their trucks
[19:34:47] <riv> send 'em to canada - oh wait
[19:36:30] <gwozniak> What is important to realize is that the police consistently asked them to leave and were peaceful about it.  Which is fine, but on the other hand, they aren't nearly as nice to, say, sit-ins to help the homeless
[19:37:14] <gwozniak> The protestors were told over and over that what they were doing was illegal.  Many just didn't care or honestly thought what they were doing was "free speech"
[19:38:12] <gwozniak> Part of the reason the convoys were less effective in other cities was because a) they learned from Ottawa's huge mistake and b) citizens came out to tell them to fuck off
[19:38:26] <edk> (b) is pleasing
[19:38:37] <gwozniak> Vancouver has a "bike wall" set up to stop them from coming into the city
[19:38:39] <edk> i do still think that a big difference between this and other protesters is just that the protesters are wrong
[19:38:55] <gwozniak> In Toronto, people just kep telling them, literally, to fuck off
[19:38:59] <companion_cube> gwozniak: blocking a pipeline, sure
[19:39:10] <companion_cube> A downtown area? Fuck
[19:39:20] <gwozniak> Yeah, there's a difference
[19:39:23] <companion_cube> In France we have that with Taxis and truckers
[19:39:36] <gwozniak> Yup, I remember that
[19:39:38] <companion_cube> And these fuckers always get what they want
[19:39:39] <edk> people have blocked downtown areas here too
[19:39:56] <edk> XR mostly in recent years
[19:40:08] <gwozniak> companion_cube: I read an article that said France caved, but Germany (and somehere else) didn't
[19:40:30] <companion_cube> I mean in the past
[19:40:37] <edk> i don't think we should stop them. but obviously we can't only protect people protesting unjust laws based on whether the law considers the protesters to be wrong
[19:40:58] <gwozniak> If they had left after the first weekend, it would be a different story
[19:41:00] <companion_cube> Someone said that Taxis are super privileged because politicians use them to move around, and thus talk to them 😂
[19:41:27] <gwozniak> Hell, if they had just organized marches for a couple hours each weekend or something, even that would have been okay
[19:41:28] <companion_cube> edk: no, there's a right to protest, not to block
[19:41:50] *** Quits: gwn (00597634f8@2604:bf00:561:2000::390) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:41:51] *** Quits: akspecs (00cc8321af@sourcehut/user/akspecs) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:41:51] <edk> see i disagree with that when the people doing the blocking are saying something i agree with
[19:42:02] <edk> so i feel i have to disagree with it when they aren't, as well
[19:42:03] <gwozniak> Sure, I think they're stupid and selfish fuckwits and if they went by my I'd yell at them, but I would not be saying to fine their asses into oblivion
[19:42:20] <gwozniak> *by me
[19:42:38] *** Joins: gwn (00597634f8@2604:bf00:561:2000::390)
[19:42:54] *** Joins: akspecs (00cc8321af@sourcehut/user/akspecs)
[19:43:30] <gwozniak> The other thing is it really morphed from "get rid of vaccine requirements at the border" to "get rid of all mandates" to "get rid of the government"
[19:44:27] <gwozniak> There was a proposal by one of the protestors to have Trudeau step aside and let this guy be the liason to the governor general
[19:44:52] <gwozniak> Forming a coalition or some nonsense with the other parties
[19:45:08] <companion_cube> edk: when do reasonable people blockade a city for weeks?
[19:45:57] <gwozniak> And, it should also be noted, that many provinces accelerated the removal of the mandates over a week ago, and the protestors didn't go anywhere
[19:48:19] <manicennui> Protesting because you want the democratically government to be removed so you can rule is kind of...
[19:48:27] <manicennui> democratically elected
[19:48:29] <gwozniak> The leader of the federal Consdervative party was outsed early during the blockade and replaced by someone who was "on the side of the truckers" (for a while, at least).
[19:48:44] <manicennui> Pretty sure Canada has legal means for these idiots to run for government.
[19:48:51] <gwozniak> She eventually said the truckers had to go, but played populism for all it was worth
[19:48:52] <manicennui> They know they'd lose though.
[19:48:59] <gwozniak> They will lose
[19:49:41] <edk> we have legal means for the XR protesters to run for office too
[19:49:47] <gwozniak> The person poised to become the new Conservative leader is even worse than the interim one
[19:49:48] <edk> but they also would have lost
[19:50:15] <manicennui> gwozniak: What percent of parliament do they control?
[19:50:32] <manicennui> XR?
[19:50:54] <gwozniak> What's weird is that the riding for the guy who may become the new leader is in the Ottawa area, so he might not get re-elected
[19:51:16] <gwozniak> manicennui: about 1/3 of the seats.  If they go populist, they will lose a bunch
[19:51:18] <edk> manicennui: extinction rebellion
[19:51:44] <gwozniak> Many voters here waffle between Liberal and Conservative
[19:52:17] <manicennui> edk: Reading about them I'm a bit disappointed. I was hoping they were pro-human extinction.
[19:52:24] <gwozniak> But there have been a bunch of Conservatives saying "wtf" to the populism stuff
[19:52:30] <edk> why were you hoping for that
[19:52:56] <manicennui> Because humans suck.
[19:53:10] <gwozniak> Overall, most of Canada's voters voter for left-leaning parties. They are just more fractured
[19:53:28] <manicennui> The US needs a left-leaning party.
[19:53:31] <riv> look up VHEM
[19:53:37] <edk> man, fuck VHEM
[19:55:05] <manicennui> Yeah, but they seem to have upset the Catholics.
[19:55:07] <manicennui> The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has criticized Knight's platform, arguing that the existence of humanity is "divinely ordained".
[19:55:17] <edk> there aren't many things that make me want to have kids but damn it if VHEM ain't one
[19:55:56] <manicennui> Really?
[19:57:02] <edk> really
[20:01:39] <edk> humanity sucks now, but just resigning to that is almost as disgusting to me as taking part in the suckage
[20:01:57] <edk> i mean it's on brand for the doomer squadron i guess
[20:04:24] <imode> "Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction."
[20:04:32] <imode> unless we sterilize the population, yeah, that tracks.
[20:05:29] <companion_cube> or we invent, hmm, contraception
[20:05:54] <imode> works if you know how to use it and keep up on it.
[20:06:48] <imode> VHEMT seems to really play a defeatist card. I can't blame them, though. the alternative is repeated societal upheval until we either reach equilibrium with our environment or we destroy it totally.
[20:07:08] <imode> and you're playing against people with billions of dollars and a grand mission to fuck the world up for more gains.
[20:07:16] <imode> hard not to be defeatist there.
[20:07:22] <imode> (in the large, anyway).
[20:07:58] <edk> yeah i can see the appeal of assuming all is already lost
[20:08:40] <gwozniak> it's an easy way out
[20:08:42] <prussian> I can't.... we've been chugging along just fine.
[20:08:53] <prussian> shit looks dumb, but it seems to function somehow.
[20:08:55] <edk> we're not chugging down a good path now
[20:09:11] <imode> edk: forget the appeal, there's no individualist solution to this problem.
[20:09:13] <prussian> we'll see.
[20:09:35] <edk> if one declares defeat now one's future actions can have no bearing on the result
[20:09:39] <imode> meaning that you really can't solve it by doing something on your own, or even encouraging collective action. you aren't the problem. the billion and trillion dollar industries that are totally adjacent to your life are.
[20:09:46] <edk> it's nice to be absolved of any responsibility
[20:09:47] <imode> pretty sure you don't participate in fast fashion or illegal dumping.
[20:09:52] <gwozniak> I am wondering if "information wants to be free" is actually a real danger to ourselves
[20:10:18] <gwozniak> Maybe "information wants to be curated" is a better slogan
[20:10:28] <edk> imode: i'm sure i participate in lots of other capitalist bullshit, though, as do you, as does everyone here
[20:10:29] <imode> you aren't the ones dumping radioactive waste into the ocean, you're not the one drilling and carving through sensitive ecosystems.
[20:10:39] <imode> yeah but you're not the one logging old growth rainforests.
[20:10:52] <imode> or clearing space for crops you don't even consume or use.
[20:10:57] <edk> yes, imode, we are
[20:11:02] <imode> uh, I'm not.
[20:11:08] <imode> if you are we have to have a talk. :P
[20:11:15] <imode> put down the chainsaw, edk.
[20:11:38] <edk> i've never personally chainsawed a rainforest to the ground, sure, but i've eaten plenty of tapioca
[20:11:48] <prussian> or am I......
[20:12:02] <prussian> also what edk said
[20:12:02] <imode> prussian: PUT IT DOWN
[20:12:36] <prussian> I get why Brazilians are going out and harvesting their ecological wonder.
[20:12:44] <prussian> gotta make a living I guess.
[20:12:49] <prussian> not sure what the solution is.
[20:13:15] <imode> you didn't eat tapioca and then a chunk of forest disappeared, someone marketed their new product to you or someone you know without telling you where it came from or what the total chain of responsibility looked like.
[20:13:19] <prussian> and ya. Palm Oil too
[20:13:28] <prussian> can't get enough of that palm
[20:13:36] <edk> well i clearly do know where it came from
[20:13:43] <imode> only after you ate a ton of it. :P
[20:13:47] <imode> much like most of the population.
[20:13:54] <prussian> if we're blissfully unaware, it just works out.
[20:13:56] <prussian> simple as.
[20:14:09] <edk> if we stopped doing things when we found out they had a negative impact on the world i think we'd have much less of a problem
[20:14:16] <edk> but in general people don't
[20:14:18] <imode> so is the responsibility of the consumer to trace down every single company's supply chain, visit it ourselves, and confirm with our eyes that it's not a problem?
[20:14:19] <prussian> probably.
[20:14:32] <imode> or is it the responsibility of the producer to provide that information so you can make an informed decision.
[20:14:35] <prussian> lotta mouths to feed, lot of jobs needed
[20:14:36] <prussian> etc...
[20:14:38] <imode> I'll give you a hint, companies would prefer the former.
[20:14:40] <prussian> lotta wealth on the table
[20:14:43] <prussian> it's hard to ignore
[20:14:45] <companion_cube> and of the governments to regulate so that externalities can't be ignored
[20:14:47] <imode> because it means they can keep doing bad shit.
[20:14:50] <edk> there is no point in your making this argument
[20:14:55] <companion_cube> the market doesn't give a shit about externalities
[20:14:56] <imode> because you know I'm right. ;)
[20:15:02] <edk> no. i know you've given up; i know you don't think you're responsible for anything you do
[20:15:26] <imode> sure I am. I'm responsible for things I can control, like where my waste goes, how much of it is present, and what it's comprised of.
[20:15:27] <edk> i think you also know that the world is not going to change unless people do start taking responsibility
[20:15:38] <imode> that has no bearing on whether someone's bulldozing a rainforest.
[20:15:40] <edk> it doesn't matter whose fault it is
[20:15:47] <imode> it seems like you have some self-hate.
[20:15:52] <imode> maybe talk to someone about that.
[20:15:53] <edk> self?
[20:15:54] <prussian> don't we all?
[20:15:58] <prussian> oh...
[20:16:39] <prussian> anyhow. we'll see how it goes. eventually the problems ramp up and become too painful to bury.
[20:16:47] <edk> that's kind of already happened
[20:16:48] <prussian> not *too* worried about it.
[20:16:50] <imode> put it to you this way, edk. if none of us bought tapioca, there would still be someone clearcutting forest land and investing in heavy marketing campaigns.
[20:17:03] <imode> same for palm oil.
[20:17:04] <companion_cube> we'll act when climate change fucks up directly in a strong way
[20:17:08] <companion_cube> not a minute before
[20:17:10] <edk> it is
[20:17:26] <edk> imode: possibly. almost certainly at a slower rate
[20:17:34] <imode> when there's profit to be made in sensitive ecosystems without financial or legal incentive to do otherwise, _it will happen_. it's how it happened!
[20:17:35] <prussian> hell, we as a species managed to prevent total ozone obliteration... but then again, I also hear stories of people charging their own AC units, but at least the AC fluid is ozone safe.... I guess?
[20:17:45] <edk> the critical point is that if we stopped buying things from them they wouldn't have any money
[20:17:46] <imode> that's how products are _introduced_.
[20:17:57] <imode> someone said "HEY WE CAN DO THIS WITH THIS INGREDIENT, LET'S RAMP UP PRODUCTION AND WE'LL FIND BUYERS".
[20:17:58] <companion_cube> who is "them"?
[20:18:08] <prussian> the evil ones
[20:18:10] <edk> in this case the people clearing rainforests
[20:18:20] <imode> yeah, edk, and _they_ have no obligation to report any of their environmental activities.
[20:18:22] <companion_cube> also, we all have computers here, probably phones
[20:18:26] <imode> so how the _fuck_ would you know who to buy from.
[20:18:30] <riv> they = big dry cleaning
[20:18:36] <imode> riv: steam me daddy
[20:18:45] <riv> :D
[20:18:47] <prussian> I am curious how a totally fucked rainforest will look like.
[20:18:52] <riv> cmake is ignoring me
[20:18:52] <edk> it's not hard to do basic research on some of this stuff
[20:18:52] <companion_cube> but without computers I don't have a job, so, no food or shelter or even visa for this country
[20:18:53] <prussian> to be honest.
[20:18:54] <imode> depressing.
[20:18:55] <riv> this is not ok
[20:18:59] <prussian> riv: ugh
[20:19:01] <prussian> fuck cmake ty
[20:19:03] <edk> prussian: i feel like you're ignoring the state of the world to some extent
[20:19:03] <prussian> no more
[20:19:04] <riv> btw cmake shouldn't exist
[20:19:05] <prussian> NO MORE
[20:19:05] <imode> edk: that research was surfaced by research groups. who's funding that shit.
[20:19:10] <edk> there are already lots of fucked rainforests
[20:19:17] <riv> its literally just GNU make but i have to google everything a second time
[20:19:19] <edk> probably most of the world's rainforests are fucked
[20:19:19] <imode> yeah come to the PNW.
[20:19:25] <imode> it's loads of fun up here.
[20:19:28] <prussian> edk: cool... cool...
[20:19:34] <prussian> I get that
[20:19:48] <prussian> but specifically the giant amazon rainforest is quite the climate engine
[20:20:06] <prussian> is more what I meant
[20:20:18] <prussian> but ya. lot of palm plantation stuff in asia
[20:20:26] <imode> just look at the old growth logging up north in quebec.
[20:20:32] <imode> thousand year old trees.
[20:20:36] <imode> laying flat. dead.
[20:20:39] <prussian> plus you got Malaysians doing slash and burn in October fucking over Singapore's air lol
[20:20:44] <imode> the whole landscape, barren apart from stumps.
[20:20:49] <prussian> damn
[20:21:03] <imode> once thriving and full of wildlife, gone.
[20:21:05] <prussian> ya, I hear cattle ranching is really accelerating the clearing of a lot of land
[20:21:19] <imode> that and just the idea of old growth logging.
[20:21:21] <prussian> crazy shit
[20:21:22] <imode> people want that fucking timber.
[20:21:28] <prussian> true as fuck
[20:21:29] <imode> and uh, if anybody's in support of that.
[20:21:34] <imode> if I find you, I'll make you into a leather pillow.
[20:21:40] <imode> and mail you to your kids.
[20:21:45] <imode> leave the planet.
[20:22:00] <prussian> is what it is. don't know what to say.
[20:22:20] <prussian> pretty scary though
[20:22:22] <imode> when things become too oppressive for you to live, I hope you'll pick up a gun.
[20:22:23] <edk> don't say anything, do something about it
[20:22:26] <prussian> how much we need to consome
[20:22:27] <prussian> lmao
[20:22:37] <prussian> ocean is getting totally wrecked too.
[20:22:56] <prussian> all the little fishies and the pH
[20:22:58] <imode> pretty sure VHEMT is gonna turn into HEMT again at some point.
[20:23:04] <gwozniak> edk: I may have surprised my sister this week when I explained that maybe not everyone needs a huge house
[20:23:18] <prussian> imode: I tend to agree, but an aimless gun is just a wasp
[20:23:20] <edk> ikr
[20:23:25] <gwozniak> Trying to make a bit of a difference in the rampant consumerism
[20:23:33] <imode> prussian: oh it ain't aimless. we're going after bezos and murdoch.
[20:23:34] <prussian> hard to really truly organize a real, effective, uh.... coup?
[20:23:34] <edk> lots of people don't need a car the size of a huge house either
[20:23:39] <edk> you're not going after anyone imode
[20:23:40] <prussian> i mean ok
[20:23:45] <prussian> idk how that changes anything.
[20:23:46] <gwozniak> edk: she also kind of has that
[20:24:05] <prussian> I'm no fan of the bezos, but he is replacable.
[20:24:18] <imode> what the fairy creek protestors should've done is just set up sniper canopies and picked off the incoming loggers.
[20:24:23] <prussian> you just have to have that sort of vague, inhuman PRness and look competent to a board.
[20:24:25] <imode> that would've been a treat.
[20:24:26] <edk> that would have been moronic
[20:24:31] <imode> nah, would've been awesome.
[20:24:42] <imode> how easily they destroy life, let's do the same to them.
[20:24:42] <gwozniak> She pointed me to huge house on some beachfront property that wasn't incredibly expensive with the line "you deserve this!"
[20:25:01] <prussian> hmm
[20:25:04] <edk> do you think the loggers feel any more responsibility for their part in this than you do for yours?
[20:25:05] <gwozniak> I gently wrote back that maybe such things aren't a great idea
[20:25:18] <imode> having met quite a few, yeah, actually.
[20:25:21] <imode> they relish it.
[20:25:31] <prussian> overtness like that would have an overt response sadly.
[20:25:39] <imode> bear in mind, I came from a state where we logged literally the entire forest cover.
[20:25:40] <prussian> well ya...
[20:25:43] <prussian> coal rolling bro
[20:25:52] <imode> loggers love that shit.
[20:25:53] <prussian> big truck. lift that bitch. let's go bois
[20:25:59] <imode> you get to spend time outdoors, you get to run heavy equipment.
[20:26:00] <prussian> loggin shiet
[20:26:02] <imode> you get to make things go boom.
[20:26:08] <imode> and you get to make a lot of money.
[20:26:20] <prussian> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:26:21] <imode> perfect financial incentive for the worthless sacks of skin that walk the earth.
[20:26:23] <edk> the loggers here don't make any money
[20:26:32] <edk> i'm pretty sure the ones in brazil don't make much either
[20:26:33] <imode> old growth loggers make a shitton of money.
[20:26:47] <imode> you can't exactly saw the thing from the bottom.
[20:27:11] <imode> gotta climb the 1-2k year old living, breathing thing and saw it from the head down.
[20:27:25] <prussian> creepy innit?
[20:27:35] <prussian> the brutal slaying of life to live
[20:27:45] <edk> creepy's not the word i would use
[20:27:50] <prussian> sad?
[20:27:55] <edk> better
[20:27:59] <imode> I had a dude who was contracted by the city genuinely claim that arsenic and cosmic rays were coming down from space to kill these 100 year old trees that they were sawwing down so the new property owner had firewood for the year.
[20:28:01] <prussian> idk. It sort of gives me a bit of a creepy vibe
[20:28:06] <prussian> a sort of necessary evil
[20:28:06] <prussian> idk
[20:28:10] <imode> they just moved in a few months ago into this ramshackle shack.

[20:28:16] <edk> gwozniak: do wonder why everyone is building them
[20:28:25] <imode> 'cuz everyone wants a piece of the pie.
[20:28:30] <prussian> log cabins?
[20:28:33] <edk> huge houses
[20:28:35] <prussian> oh
[20:28:48] <gwozniak> edk: part of it is ego, but another part is being able to flip the property
[20:28:49] <edk> big houses are a pain, and there's not enough little ones anyway
[20:28:53] <prussian> reminds me o carlsbad, how it's all man camps and hotels down near the oil fields.
[20:28:54] <imode> I actually wonder about the optimal use of trees. log cabins seem optimal-ish.
[20:29:03] <gwozniak> Yeah.  Like, maintenance on a big house sucks
[20:29:07] <prussian> everyone rushes in for the money and leaves when it becomes unprofitable lol
[20:29:11] <imode> my parents own a log cabin they built with trees off their land.
[20:29:25] <prussian> nice
[20:29:29] <imode> I wonder how "large" you could make a house if you converted those trees into actual lumber.
[20:29:41] <gwozniak> I don't want to heat a huge dwelling
[20:29:44] <imode> and if the insulatory/structural properties were a benefit.
[20:29:55] <edk> log cabins are probably not a very good use of trees in my mind
[20:30:15] <gwozniak> burning wood for fuel is quite dirty, as a I recall
[20:30:15] <imode> same, but I wonder why they were popular. or are popular.
[20:30:17] <prussian> probably not, but they look cool, well to some.
[20:30:25] <prussian> probably the ruggedness of it.
[20:30:26] <imode> they're also far more structurally sound in harsh weather iirc.
[20:30:27] <prussian> is my guess.
[20:30:41] <edk> well, where i grew up we mostly built houses out of stone
[20:30:53] <imode> that'd beat a log cabin lmao.
[20:31:05] <imode> ..wait are we talking like, carved out of stone.
[20:31:08] <imode> or just with brick and mortar.
[20:31:27] <imode> if the former, that's awesome.
[20:32:17] <edk> these days brick and mortar would be more common, but generally older houses there are built out of roughly-shaped blocks of stone
[20:32:34] <edk> like really big bricks, i guess
[20:32:36] <imode> I wonder how that'd hold up w.r.t the structural irregularities.
[20:32:58] <imode> like you can't ensure an even distribution of force over the structure with larger and smaller stones unless you get your distribution right.
[20:34:24] <edk> such buildings can't be builty particularly tall. they rely on the fact that rocks like granite are both extremely strong under compression, and extremely heavy which means they will always be under compression

[20:35:00] <imode> hm, neat.
[20:35:35] <imode> stone would definitely be a better choice to build a home out of.
[20:35:44] <imode> or some sort of stone-like material.
[20:36:06] <prussian> Been happy with stick frame Americana style myself.
[20:36:16] <imode> now I'm imagining a giant ceramic home.
[20:36:23] <imode> big ass kiln.
[20:37:46] <prussian> Like, one solid piece?
[20:37:47] <prussian> Damn
[20:39:01] <edk> adobe bricks are kind of like that i guess
[20:41:32] <prussian> w.r.t. bug houses. One plus would be having all the facilities to do whatever hobby you'd want, potentially. If it's just a bunch of furnished and unused rooms though, that's pretty lame.

[21:00:36] <manicennui> https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/18/google-raleigh-hbcu-salary/?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_source=reddit.com
[21:00:49] <manicennui> Google has lowered salaries for new workers in some North Carolina offices, one of the areas company executives say is meant to help increase the overall diversity of the tech giant’s workforce.
[21:01:38] <gerikson> o_O
[21:03:15] <manicennui> Not sure why someone would even want to work for Google at that point.
[21:03:25] <manicennui> Not like finding another job is hard.
[21:03:40] <manicennui> Stock equity grants, which typically make up a significant portion of tech workers’ total compensation, are also being reduced starting last month. For some employees, that means their stock grants could be 25 percent lower than if they worked at other Google offices, like in Atlanta, the workers said in the letter.
[21:03:54] <manicennui> The research triangle is one of the fastest growing areas of the US.
[21:04:02] <manicennui> With expected cost of living increases.
[21:10:24] <manicennui> "Substrate-free bioluminescent human cell production"
[21:10:24] <manicennui> heh
[21:10:40] <manicennui> I know what this is probably for, but I want to imagine that this startup is working on making humans glow in the dark.
[21:11:50] <companion_cube> manicennui: it's well known that women and poc will only accept lower salaries
[21:11:56] <companion_cube> Google is helping them actually
[21:11:59] <manicennui> heh
[21:12:16] <manicennui> That claim is repeated again in the article.
[21:12:19] <companion_cube> Can't just offer white man salary, you dummy
[21:12:26] <manicennui> And it is obvious that it is really about hiring cheaper people.
[21:12:36] <manicennui> I don't know who is fooled by the diversity claim.
[21:13:30] <manicennui> "Google’s workforce has historically been concentrated in the San Francisco Bay area, one of the most expensive places to live in the country. But in 2020, the company said it would double down on hiring in a broader range of locations, in part to help increase the diversity of the company’s workforce."
[21:13:41] <manicennui> A diversity of salaries.
[21:13:45] <companion_cube> That's legit, but offering less isn't
[21:13:57] <ngoldbaum> klabnik dhh takes: https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1495796376101400580
[21:13:57] <buttsbot> Twitter - steveklabnik - Listen when a core component of how you, your company, and your OSS was basically trolling for outrage clicks I dunno why ...
[21:14:00] <manicennui> No, it isn't about diversity at all.
[21:14:07] <manicennui> They don't even explain what they might mean by that.
[21:14:15] <manicennui> They just throw it in to make it sound positive.
[21:14:20] <manicennui> They just want cheaper people.
[21:16:00] <companion_cube> The silicon Valley is indeed a sausage fest
[21:16:16] <manicennui> Sure, but they don't actually care about that.
[21:16:22] <companion_cube> Of people self selecting for being willing to move there
[21:16:26] <companion_cube> Yeah, you're right.
[21:16:39] <manicennui> If they could hire 100% white men at lower salaries they would.
[21:16:55] <manicennui> They just can't find enough people locally, and they'd like to pay less.
[21:17:17] <manicennui> I imagine that the amount of dead weight at a company like Google is above 25%.
[21:17:50] <manicennui> "According to the official Google employee report, 27,169 software engineers work at Google"
[21:18:37] <companion_cube> And look at how much crap they churn
[21:18:40] <companion_cube> Truly impressive
[21:19:00] <ngoldbaum> that doesn’t count contractors either
[21:19:00] <companion_cube> Google would be better off going to back to 2010 gmail and gmaps, for example
[21:19:04] <manicennui> It's hard for me to think of anything Google has done in the last decade that I care about.
[21:19:13] <manicennui> All of the things I use from them existed for a long time.
[21:19:23] <manicennui> Not that there is no maintenance work to be done on those things.
[21:19:38] <manicennui> But I don't buy that they are getting anywhere near 30k engineers worth of value.
[21:19:46] <companion_cube> Sure, but that's not the same as rewrites
[21:20:30] <ngoldbaum> the contractors do the maintainance
[21:20:49] <ngoldbaum> those 30k are supposedly working on greenfield stuff so their manager can get a promotion
[21:22:34] <manicennui> I'm kind of impressed that my employer got rid of most of the top levels of SE management.
[21:22:57] <manicennui> We lost a couple of our senior managers, our director, and our CTO and replaced none of them.
[21:22:59] <manicennui> And nothing has changed.
[21:23:06] <manicennui> And it's been a couple years now.
[21:23:24] <manicennui> My manager reports directly to a high level director in charge of several large groups now.
[21:24:53] <Geekingfrog> That's how you see where are the real priorities of the top brass (at least the one who remain)
[21:25:16] <manicennui> Fortunately we are mostly left alone.
[21:25:48] <manicennui> The company benefits far more from our product being part of the company than the product benefits from being part of the larger company.
[21:25:59] <manicennui> And fortunately the execs don't meddle with us.
[21:26:49] <manicennui> I'm pretty sure we'd make more money if we were spun off. About the only thing they don't want us to do is compete with one of the other brands.
[21:35:23] <prussian> consolidate all the business units.

[21:44:32] <imode> I always wanted those.
[21:44:37] <imode> do they still make 'em for adults.
[21:44:46] <imode> I'd fuckin' shred on em.
[21:45:58] <manicennui> Remember when rollerblades were a fad?
[21:46:13] <manicennui> I had a pair, but I never got good.
[21:48:50] <imode> if I had a pair I'd probably use them a lot. I have two e-scooters that I use(d) for primary transportation for a while.
[21:48:59] <imode> one of them could go 60 if I pushed it enough.
[21:49:23] <imode> had two fun summers beelining through residential empty roads.
[21:49:48] <imode> then I turned too hard and almost tore my arm off.
[21:50:05] <imode> haven't ridden since.
[21:50:39] <kline> in the UK you cant use electric scooters legally
[21:50:44] <manicennui> Back in my day, getting injured while doing stupid shit on a bike or rollerblades or whatever was expected!
[21:50:44] <kline> confirmed menace to society
[21:51:12] <manicennui> We did so much dumb shit.
[21:52:05] <imode> definitely, but if I can't type I can't work. :P
[21:52:57] <manicennui> These days I injure myself while sleeping.
[21:53:39] <kline> manicennui's pillow: "Stop hitting yourself!"
[21:53:50] <imode> kline: even ones you don't sit on?
[21:53:59] <imode> they're skateboards with handlebars.
[21:54:04] <imode> and an electric motor.
[21:54:17] <manicennui> My left shoulder and neck often hurt from sleeping on that side.
[21:54:21] <kline> imode, correct
[21:54:45] <manicennui> But it is the most comfortable side to sleep on.
[21:54:45] <kline> like these ones: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Lime-S_Scooters.jpg
[21:54:52] <manicennui> I can't fall asleep on my back.
[21:55:08] <imode> huh. wild.
[21:55:10] <imode> wonder why.
[21:55:16] <imode> I say as my right arm twinges.
[21:55:32] <manicennui> Out of shape and overweight.
[21:55:40] <kline> because they count as motor vehicle, ie, they are motorised devices for transport that are not suitable for cohabiting with pedestrians and dont fit any other category
[21:55:55] <imode> yeah... at most they belong in the bike lane.
[21:56:08] <kline> so you need a roadworthiness certificate (MOT), vehicle tax, insurance, and a driving license
[21:56:11] <imode> at a capped speed.
[21:56:13] <imode> damn!
[21:56:41] <kline> unfortunately none of the above have provisions for them, they are essentially unclassified experimental electric vehicles in la
[21:56:42] <kline> law
[21:57:10] <kline> i suppose you could try and provision them as, saw, a very small electric motorbike, but i dont think youd have much luck
[21:57:17] <kline> say*
[21:57:28] <imode> do regular electric motorbikes have the same constraints?
[21:57:36] * manicennui wishes mopeds were more of a thing.
[21:57:42] <manicennui> Mopeds make a lot more sense in cities.
[21:58:03] <kline> imode, electric motorbikes are treated as motorbikes, but they are actually classified as such
[21:58:08] <manicennui> I don't know whether I'd want to risk being run over by some SUV though.
[21:58:20] <kline> there is no class of vehicles that electric scooters fall into
[21:58:38] <imode> is this that disruption I've heard so much about. :P

[21:59:54] <kline> disrupt your driving license directly into jail
[22:01:20] <kline> technically you can have your licensed revoked for a single incident under these rules, by 1) riding with no insurance and 2) riding without the correct license, which both can earn 6 points each
[22:01:45] <kline> 12 points and your license may be revoked, meaning you cant drive your car to work because you tried to ride your e-scooter back from the pub
[22:05:12] <imode> that's ridiculous.
[22:06:26] <manicennui> I think I might have to learn Kotlin.
[22:09:57] <imode> a coworker keeps trying to push me towards it.
[22:12:40] <manicennui> We acquired a company that is a Java shop, and they make up about half the company now.
[22:12:54] <manicennui> Then we have the rest of the company that is Ruby and Go.
[22:13:26] <manicennui> I can't stand Go, and I don't really want to write Java, but I'd like to work with the JVM, and there is appetite for something like Kotlin.
[22:13:36] <manicennui> We also use Kotlin for Android development.
[22:20:44] *** Quits: klardotsh (~klardotsh@172.58.43.31) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[22:31:42] <imode> I have a love/hate relationship with java.
[22:31:52] <imode> if you can phrase it all in terms of streams, data sources and sinks, it's great.
[22:32:59] <manicennui> Yeah, I think I could tolerate it.
[22:33:04] <manicennui> But Kotlin would be better.
[22:33:49] <manicennui> I think the biggest change for people on my team would be having to use an IDE.
[22:34:11] <manicennui> And in the past I've found that just setting up the IDE well in a consistent manner is a pain.
[22:34:30] <manicennui> Not sure whether people have finally standardized on one project format in Java land.
[22:37:01] <imode> mm. IntelliJ does all the shit you want for you.
[22:37:21] *** Joins: river (~My_user_n@tilde.team/user/river)
[22:37:31] <imode> if I just used a text editor and a terminal, I wouldn't make this progress.
[22:38:06] <imode> language-specific IDEs are almost a requirement when you're jumping into unfamiliar codebases.
[22:38:18] <imode> well, for complicated, dynamic languages with lots of fancy features.
[22:38:21] <manicennui> Sure, but the last time I worked on something there were like a couple different project formats.
[22:38:22] <imode> don't think you'd need that for, say, C.
[22:38:37] <manicennui> And the IDEs could import different formats, but there always seemed to be a bit of manual setup.
[22:38:52] * manicennui uses vim with Ruby.
[22:40:52] <prussian> aren't all text editors basically just IDEs?
[22:42:25] <manicennui> You could certainly configure most of them that way.
[22:42:43] <manicennui> But my vim usage is pretty basic.
[22:43:09] <manicennui> I'm probably not as efficient as I could be, but changing code is the easiest part of software development.
[22:43:19] <manicennui> Saving 10% there doesn't move the needle.
[22:44:21] <prussian> true.
[22:44:40] <manicennui> I've never understood the obsession that many developers have with saving a few keystrokes.
[22:45:34] <manicennui> There is so much more value in working on the right things and designing them well.
[22:49:48] <gwozniak> The thing I appreciate with the IDE thing is the code navigation
[22:49:59] <gwozniak> The completion stuff is less useful
[22:50:22] <manicennui> You can do the code navigation stuff with most text editors too.
[22:50:29] <manicennui> Just isn't ready to go out of the box.
[22:50:35] <gwozniak> Getting LSP stuff working in Emacs to navigate GCC and stuff has been really helpful
[22:50:57] <gwozniak> Especially since grep and tags and such don't work so well
[22:51:02] <manicennui> Yeah, LSP is making the argument for text editors stronger.
[22:51:37] <gwozniak> But LSP navigation is not sufficient.  I still have to raw text search the codebase for things on a regular basis
[22:52:48] <manicennui> I feel like we are going to be really fucked in the elections this year.
[22:53:05] <manicennui> Everyone holds the Democratic party to a far higher standard than the Republican party.
[22:53:25] <manicennui> And while they are total shitters, letting them lose to Republicans is not going to help anything.
[22:54:27] <manicennui> All Republicans have to do is insult the right people to get their voters out.
[22:55:38] <manicennui> And fuck shit like this: https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/18/white-house-tries-to-woo-republicans-on-scotus-with-trepidation-00010245

[22:56:14] <manicennui> Stop with the "reach across the aisle" nonsense.
[22:56:28] <gwozniak> It's the wrong move here, I'm pretty sure
[22:57:05] <gwozniak> Listening to other arguments is legit, but when the other side has no interest in playing fair or even your well-being, you need to cut that shit out
[22:57:37] <manicennui> SCOTUS nominations always come down to the same few issues.
[22:57:58] <gwozniak> Really, can we just stop pretending that SCOTUS nominations aren't political?
[22:58:16] <gwozniak> Or that the Court itself is not political?
[22:58:28] <gwozniak> It to blatantly is
[22:58:32] <gwozniak> *so
[22:58:35] <manicennui> I wouldn't doubt that the Republicans will stall the nomination for bullshit reasons again.
[22:59:18] <manicennui> And Biden will pick someone who doesn't upset Republicans too much.
[22:59:37] <manicennui> And half of them will vote against the nomination anyways.
