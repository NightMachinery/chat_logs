[03:53:31] <kuudes> I think at least over here clones having sex with each other would be criminal
[03:53:35] <gwern> they really will be able to ban every criticism or meme about the CDC etc

[03:54:07] <gwern> *which* relatives? :thinking_face:

[03:54:52] <kuudes> I think so
[03:55:02] <kuudes> a minute, I'll check
[03:56:47] <kuudes> hmm. yeah, it is open. but sex with brother or sister is criminal
[03:57:10] <kuudes> so it would require deeming your clone as your sibling, which would be logical otoh
[03:57:38] <kuudes> because the intent of the law is to ban sex with so close relatives that it produces or could produce malformations
[03:57:52] <kuudes> consent does not overrule, even on adults
[03:58:26] <kuudes> up to 2 years of prison if you have intercourse with a listed person even as adult if you are not forced to it etc
[03:58:33] <gwern> hm. if it's specifically about malformations, then yeah, clone or not, hard to get around that one
[03:58:57] <kuudes> it is not mentioned in the legal code, but I think it is in the discussion part, but unsure
[03:59:29] <kuudes> but specifically it is meant to punish, say, 40 and 60 year old listed persons on listed acts
[04:00:07] <kuudes> and it is not in sex crimes but in crimes against society

[04:10:22] <kuudes> no, I was wrong, it specifically says the malformation harm is not realistic, and that the articla is only for protection of family institution
[04:10:40] <kuudes> but still it limits the crime only to biological family
[04:10:42] <kuudes> O_o
[04:11:06] <gwern> hm... so I could clone myself, delete the Y chromosome, give her up for adoption, and then wait for her to become legal?
[04:11:21] <kuudes> but specifically it was wanted that it would apply to homosexual acts as well as heterosexual acts
[04:12:12] <kuudes> it seems to be very confusing piece of law, which sort of is not meant to happen at any time, but which seems like a thing no one dares to propose dropping...
[04:13:05] <PapuaHardyNet> will fem-gwern want to date gwern though? (no offense! its just, by default women have so many options, and a fem-gwern already sounds like someone who has 100x more options than most LWers)
[04:15:01] <dTal> would anyone want to date the person that cloned themselves and gave them up for adoption many decades prior? I'm gonna go with no
[04:15:22] <kuudes> apparently there was debate on if that articla was necessary, as all victimizations are already criminalized, and this change just made also the younger party of consensual incest a perpetrator as well; but still limited adoptive relatives out of it, which at the same time finding explicitly that there are no medical reasons for this...
[04:15:44] <dTal> it's not so much "no offense" as "ew ew ew ew ew ew ew no no no hell no ew"
[04:16:03] <kuudes> gwern, if you knew she was your relative in the sense law says, then you would be guilty but if she did not know, she would not be

[04:17:30] <dTal> I'm pretty sure that disgust is a powerful rationality hint
[04:17:49] <dTal> it's not a "norm", it's an instinctive reaction evolved over millions of years

[04:21:22] <dTal> I can certainly defend it as a rational response
[04:21:38] <PapuaHardyNet> gosh
[04:22:17] <dTal> the main reason I don't want to is because it's politically charged, so that's kind of an unfair example
[04:22:53] <gwern> hehe. so, you want to defend the accuracy and consistency of disgust on only the ones we all agree are accurate eh
[04:22:56] <dTal> but things like that are maybe a good example of "rational" being relative to a goal
[04:23:21] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: ok now there's another problem with GW fonts - the icon for "events" has disappeared
[04:25:30] <dTal> well what I was saying is that it's unfair to pick an example that it's difficult to discuss freely for reasons extrinsic to the argument. You have cornered me, rhetorically, into defending transphobia
[04:25:47] <dTal> would you like to select *any* other example?
[04:26:06] * gwern grins. nope.
[04:26:08] <dTal> or shall I sit here and make everyone uncomfortable by following through?
[04:28:10] <dTal> Do you think that a disgust response to trans people is *irrational*? Or merely socially undesirable?
[04:28:33] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, okay hold on
[04:28:47] <PapuaHardyNet> in the interest of making this a bit more productive, let's switch to a less charged, but equivalent example
[04:29:10] <dTal> There are obvious, plausible reasons why transphobia could be reproductively adaptive.
[04:29:33] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, this is on you
[04:29:40] <saturn2> disgust isn't rational because it's not responsive to new information
[04:29:53] <quanticle> >irrationality is by definition not adaptive
[04:29:55] <quanticle> Uh
[04:29:57] <quanticle> No?
[04:30:14] <quanticle> Irrationality can be preserved if it doesn't result in a loss of fitness
[04:30:39] <dTal> What exactly is meant by rationality then
[04:31:01] <quanticle> Heck, it might even be selected for if it results in greater reproduction. 5 guys do some irrational dumb thing, 4 of them die stupid obvious deaths, but the one that survives gets a bunch of chicks
[04:31:29] <dTal> seems to be that if you dying early or with no children, "but I'm right!!" isn't going to convince natural selection
[04:31:37] <quanticle> What is "rational" at the species level is not necessarily rational at the individual level. This is evolutionary biology 101.
[04:32:14] <PapuaHardyNet> question, dTal. do you know what "epistemic rationality" and "instrumental rationality" means?
[04:32:44] <dTal> PapuaHardyNet: I do now :)
[04:33:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: ... wtf?
[04:33:07] <quanticle> No, this isn't even a question epistemic vs. instrumental rationality. This is literally just the fallacy of division
[04:33:15] <PapuaHardyNet> great. I recommend reading the Sequences before you get into such arguments.

[04:33:31] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah. maybe the subsetting got rolled back to an earlier version?

[04:35:15] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: you touched it to add that icon back when i added that feature
[04:35:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, yes, that's true
[04:35:35] <saturn2> iirc it was the last thing added
[04:35:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was approximately ever ago, though!
[04:35:55] <dTal> No, I haven't read The Sequences
[04:36:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah anything's possibly obviously, this is the web
[04:36:03] <quanticle> You should
[04:36:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> dTal: You should definitely Read The Sequences... dot com
[04:36:22] <dTal> there's a lot of them
[04:36:28] <PapuaHardyNet> no, read them
[04:36:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are exactly 26
[04:36:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (no of course I am lying, that's just how many are in R:AZ)
[04:36:56] <dTal> Do the Sequences have very much to say about evolutionary psychology?
[04:37:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course
[04:37:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's literally a post *called* "Evolutionary Psychology"!
[04:37:54] <dTal> epistemic rationality is surely strictly subservient to instrumental rationality?
[04:37:56] <saturn2> always read the sequences, never don't read the sequences
[04:38:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a whole sequences all *about* evolution
[04:38:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> dTal: Definitely not "surely", no

[05:30:32] <PapuaHardyNet> have you read the latest books regarding that by the way? Keith E. Stanovich released a book called "The Rationality Quotient"

The castle was constructed by Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century as part of his campaign to maintain control of Glamorgan, and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert, his descendants, and the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes ‚Äì considered by ‚Ä¶)
[05:42:10] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: okay, thanks
[05:42:37] <PapuaHardyNet> "According to Ovid, when Pygmalion saw the Propoetides of Cyprus practicing prostitution he became a misogynist, "detesting the faults beyond measure which nature has given to women". He determined to remain celibate and to occupy himself with sculpting. He made a sculpture of a woman that he found so perfect he fell in love with it. Pygmalion kisses and fondles the sculpture, brings it various gifts, and creates a sumptuous bed for it."
[05:42:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem with "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take", I have just realized, is that it ignores opportunity costs
[05:42:53] <PapuaHardyNet> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(mythology) sounds familiar?
[05:42:54] <Robomot> Pygmalion (mythology) - Wikipedia (In Greek mythology Pygmalion (/p…™…°Ààme…™li…ôn/; Ancient Greek: Œ†œÖŒ≥ŒºŒ±ŒªŒØœâŒΩ Pugmal√≠≈çn, gen.: Œ†œÖŒ≥ŒºŒ±ŒªŒØœâŒΩŒøœÇ) is a legendary figure of Cyprus, who was a king and a sculptor. He is most familiar from Ovid's narrative poem Metamorphoses, in which Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had carved.)
[05:43:16] <saturn2> adiabatic: the point is that you need to actually confirm your insights rather than just take the feeling itself as confirmation
[05:43:23] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot: it also ignores the pain of rejection (whether romantic or career related). It hurts, damn it
[05:43:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact you miss only some of the shots you don't take! Because not taking some shot means you are instead doing something else, which could also be some sort of shot
[05:43:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I'm not really talking just about "applying for" things or "trying to be accepted" by someone or some place, but more generally
[05:44:53] <PapuaHardyNet> oh okay. I agree with your point anyway: opportunity costs.
[05:45:39] <adiabatic> I couldn't confirm the one insight that I had because I can't peer into others' minds, but it _did_ explain why other people act the way they do much better than my mental model of other people before I had that insight

[05:50:49] <quanticle> gwern: It's remarkable how so many of those old castles both never get conquered, but also never seem to be all that important outside of maybe a 50 year period spanning their construction.
[05:51:02] <gwern> armies and peoples move, but not castles, yeah
[05:51:08] <PlanckWalk> Every shot you take on one thing is a shot you didn't take on another thing.
[05:51:23] <gwern> when you read about all these mothballed castles, you start to appreciate the virtues of dynamic defense and minimizing fortification investment
[05:52:53] <gwern> especially when you look at all that back and forth and what it took to create caerphilly in the first place - in a sense, the only reason caerphilly could be completed was that it was no longer necessary

[06:55:32] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: well, RL must use such large batch sizes because the signal is usually so incredibly tenuous and weak, that you have to aggregate big batches before the model changes enough that you even hit the diminishing returns
[06:56:12] <PapuaHardyNet> yep yep! I didn't have a mental model about all this stuff until I began reading this paper (which I am still reading rn): https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06162

However the limits of this massive data / parallelism seem to differ from domain to domain, ranging from batches of tens / of thousands in ImageNet to batches of millions in RL ‚Ä¶)
[06:56:29] <gwern> when language models like GPT-3 use huge batch sizes, it's because language encodes thousands or millions of diferent tasks that it's learning efficiently in parallel. when DRL (the 'D' stands for 'durrrr') uses batch sizes of millions to solve a tiny problem like dota, it's because it's really dumb

[08:03:11] <gwern> didn't you say you made mayo at home and it was way better anyway?

[08:03:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And no, the previous thing I mentioned that you're probably thinking of is sour cream
[08:03:58] <nshepperd2> how do you make mayonnaise anyway
[08:04:13] <gwern> I assume you start by gathering a lot of guys and a woman
[08:04:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Pretty much you put eggs and oil (ideally not soybean or w/e, lol) into a measuring cup and then you go at it with a mixer (with whisk attachment) or immersion blender until mayo results
[08:04:45] <PapuaHardyNet> does it have to be a woman
[08:04:46] <gwern> (the guys go out and buy eggs and other ingredients and the woman mixes it all in the kitchen, of course)
[08:05:15] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: huh
[08:05:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: It's just an emulsion of oil and eggs, really. Everything else is commentary^W flavoring/etc.

[08:07:36] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Yeah, I got some Cara Cara oranges the other day, by mistake. I was looking for navel oranges and got Cara Cara by mistake. Was pleasantly surprised.

[08:08:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (N.B., again: "vegetable oil" is American code for "soybean oil")
[08:08:18] <nshepperd2> so the mayonnaise from the store has a hundred ingredients because preservatives i suppose
[08:08:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[08:08:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly so
[08:08:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also they often use egg powder and so on
[08:08:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> This *is* technically raw eggs, after all
[08:09:26] <quanticle> Yeah, that's the thing. The mayonnaise you make at home tastes great and is probably better for you, but, on the other hand, if you leave it for longer than a week it'll rot

[08:10:57] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, so you have easy access to citeseer, they are just blocking your bot
[08:11:01] <PapuaHardyNet> that's all right then
[08:11:30] <PapuaHardyNet> tell me if you need a IEEE, Springer, JSTOR, PubMed, OUP, EBSCO, or ACM paper
[08:13:29] <quanticle> Okay, Linux folks, I have a question for you. I'm using Ubuntu 21.10, with the default display server (Wayland) and desktop environment (Gnome 40), and I've noticed a really weird issue. When I alt-tab more than once, I have to move the mouse in order to scroll the window. So, for example, if I have a terminal, emacs and Chrome open, and I hit alt-tab twice, to go from the terminal to Chrome, I
[08:13:31] <quanticle> need to move the mouse before Chrome will respond to the scroll wheel.
[08:14:07] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, ignore what I said, I decided to try to get a paper through my uni catalog and even I'm unsure how the system works
[08:14:14] <saturn2> did store bought mayo ever resemble real mayo? i thought it was always a soy based laboratory concoction
[08:15:11] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: hehe. I remember that all too well. there'd be 3 different databases, and only the 4th way worked
[08:15:19] <saturn2> quanticle: `sudo apt remove wayland` should fix you right up
[08:15:22] <gwern> (which is why even academics tend to just use lg when they can)
[08:16:07] <quanticle> saturn2: lmao
[08:16:43] <quanticle> Also, you have to distinguish between "real" store-bought mayo and mayo-substitutes like Miracle Whip
[08:17:16] <quanticle> Kind of like how you have to distinguish between real whipped cream and, say, "whipped topping" like Cool Whip
[08:17:49] <quanticle> Though, with regards to the latter, I've found that Cool Whip actually goes bad *faster* than real whipped cream, despite it not being made from milk
[08:19:18] <Obormot\Gaia> Continuing the "everything is soy" theme: the aforesaid tuna salad obviously also needs canned tuna, which I once again inspected before purchasing and found that it comes in two varieties: "in oil" (which is of course soybean oil) or "in water" (which actually means in "vegetable broth (contains soy)")
[08:20:13] <Obormot\Gaia> There was one brand where it's just tuna and nothing else, and one with tuna and olive oil. The latter was $3.19 a can, the former... $5 a can.
[08:20:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Needless to say, the tuna salad you get on your tuna salad bagel sandwich from the local bagel shoppe is made with...)

[08:23:10] <quanticle> Wayland issue or Gnome issue
[08:23:15] <quanticle> Or some interaction between the two

[10:48:29] <PapuaHardyNet> "If you sleep just enough to be awake during the day, you‚Äôll be dreaming of getting a nap at the sight of a bed and will be distracted and sleepy all the time. Importantly, I claim, in this situation, the feeling of sleepiness does not mean that you should sleep more ‚Äì it‚Äôs your brain being overpowered by a superstimulus while being bored.
[10:48:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I claim that if you sleep as much as you want, you‚Äôll probably sleep too much and become more susceptible to depression." very bold

[10:58:29] <PapuaHardyNet> "Sleep is not required for memory consolidation." guzey backs this with quotes. gosh, if this is true it changes the whole idea of "SRS everyday b/c you sleep every night"
[10:58:31] <quanticle> Yes, all of it
[10:58:43] <PapuaHardyNet> That's pretty crazy. It changes a lot.
[10:59:35] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm not sure how much I believe that part.
[10:59:36] <capisce> so, don't sleep less if you have a boring job
[11:02:03] <quanticle> Like, the parts where he talks about excessive sleep being a cause of depression; I'm not sure how much of that is correlation and how much is causation.
[11:04:45] <PapuaHardyNet> based on experience I feel that makes sense. I feel *good* when I am sleep deprived - there's a slight buzz. At least, when I am not sleepy.
[11:04:52] <nshepperd2> sleep deprivation as a treatment for depression has some experimental grounding
[11:04:52] <PapuaHardyNet> sleepiness is the biggest confounding factor here
[11:05:10] <nshepperd2> unclear if it's better to be a sleep deprived zombie than a depressed zombie though
[11:07:10] <PapuaHardyNet> that's where caffeine, moda, amphetamines, and nicotine come in
[11:07:31] <nshepperd2>  yeah maybe
[11:07:55] <nshepperd2> modafinil has fewer side effects than most antidepressants at least
[11:08:46] <PapuaHardyNet> SSRIs, aka "ace-creators", are the scariest

[11:09:57] <phill> lol
[11:09:57] <PapuaHardyNet> ace = asexual
[11:10:07] <phill> just google "hormesis sleep"

[11:10:24] <PapuaHardyNet> phill: https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/ssris-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/ here you go for the SSRIs => asexual connection

[11:10:39] <phill> oh
[11:10:55] <phill> thought you were talking about angiotensin converting enzyme or something
[11:11:23] <phill> i don't need ssri's to make me "ace"
[11:11:55] <PapuaHardyNet> are you implying you are already asexual? I'm confused
[11:12:14] <phill> yes
[11:13:37] <PapuaHardyNet> that's all right. The bigger issue is that SSRIs not only kill your desire, but make orgasms anhedonic. They kill your erection and numb your genitals
[11:14:15] <PapuaHardyNet> all of this combined can be traumatic for someone who isn't in a major depression
[11:14:20] <PapuaHardyNet> (or worsen the depression)
[11:16:50] <phill> yeah ive never orgasmed
[11:16:54] <phill> well, consciously
[11:16:59] <phill> "I have been able to find exactly one pre-registered experiment of the impact of prolonged sleep deprivation on cognition. It was published by economists from Harvard and MIT in 2021 and its pre-registered analysis found null or negative effects of sleep on all primary outcomes"
[11:17:08] <phill> i guess he's only talking about nighttime sleep?
[11:17:48] <phill> this is from the abstract: "In contrast, short afternoon naps at the workplace improved an overall index of outcomes by 0.12 standard deviations, with significant increases in productivity, psychological well-being, and cognition, but a decrease in work time."
[11:19:34] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, he is talking about nighttime sleep
[11:20:26] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, any robust attempt to weaken guzey's argument will have a huge (positive) impact on the rat community, because guzey is *very* well known in it, so if you do find something good, you know what to do
[11:20:45] <phill> what, just post here?
[11:21:32] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah sure
[11:39:32] <kuudes> "SSRIs not only kill your desire, but make orgasms anhedonic. They kill your erection and numb your genitals" <- I have not experienced such, so I wonder how well that generalizes really

[11:51:32] <phill> honestly
[11:52:22] <phill> if he's saying the sleep stuff isn't super solidly ground in science, after looking into it, it seems like i agree
[11:52:57] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: filthy normie
[11:54:32] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao he messaged me again "okay there's something I need to tell you"
[11:54:50] <PapuaHardyNet> no he is not into me, before you claim this
[11:55:20] <phill> but if you look at the "official" sleep statement papers, they don't seem too confident either: https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/pressroom/adult-sleep-duration-methods.pdf
[11:55:22] <Robomot> PDF (22 pages; 5.7 MB) - Recommended Amount of Sleep for a Healthy Adult (American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society) - Consensus Statement Methodology and Discussion
[12:02:30] <phill> honestly it almost seems like guzley's using more case reports and the aasm is using observational/few cross-sectional
[12:04:46] <phill> (and the aasm doesn't even recommend against 6-7h of sleep, but it does recommend against <6h)
[12:05:41] <PapuaHardyNet> phill: I agree with you. I have updated my beliefs such that I believe 6hr sleep daily is long term okay, and even good due to manic benefits and opportunity gains due to time
[12:06:03] <PapuaHardyNet> All I have to do is try running on 6hrs for the next month and see what happens
[12:06:25] <phill> lol manic benefit
[12:06:27] <phill> benefits*
[12:06:40] <phill> manicness is very interesting
[12:07:40] <kuudes> I mean, ok, if you are talking about the anticovid ssri, ok
[12:09:02] <phill> The CDC and the professional sleep researchers pull the numbers out of their asses without any kind of rigorous scientific evidence for their ‚Äúconsensus recommendations‚Äù. There‚Äôs no causal evidence that sleeping 7-9 hours is healthier than sleeping 6 hours or less. Correlational evidence suggests that people who sleep 4 hours have the same if not lower mortality as those who sleep 8 hours and that people who sleep 6-7 hours 
[12:09:02] <phill> have the lowest mortality.
[12:09:11] <phill> i mean, they never claimed a causal relationship
[12:09:30] <phill> reading the report, they're pretty straightforward about it being most observational
[12:09:39] <phill> and hard to apply to most people
[12:10:04] <phill> also he put out a paper that was released after the report was written
[12:10:15] <PapuaHardyNet> not what "Why We Sleep" - the most influential popular science book on sleep ever written - claims
[12:10:18] <phill> put an image of*
[12:10:44] <phill> yeah, it's one thing to go against Walker and a book
[12:10:46] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry, I don't get what you mean about the image of paper thing
[12:10:59] <phill> but another thing to misrepresent the cdc stuff
[12:11:37] <phill> the image accompanying "Correlational evidence suggests that people who sleep 4 hours have the same if not lower mortality as those who sleep 8 hours and that people who sleep 6-7 hours"
[12:12:45] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, I see what you mean
[12:13:06] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, that sounds like misrepresentation
[12:13:36] <phill> it is kind of interesting that the aasm paper specifically excluded sleep deprivation as treatment for depression papers
[12:14:49] <saturn2> i feel horrible when i'm sleep deprived, am i a mutant?
[12:14:56] <phill> "The search results were reviewed based on title and excluded a priori for the following reasons: focusing on sleep quality or fatigue instead of sleep duration; assessing sleep duration in specific illnesses or sleep disorders; experimentation involving total sleep deprivation; inclusion of subjects sleeping outside normal day/night sleep schedules; assessing sleep deprivation as a treatment (e.g., depression); focusing on 
[12:14:56] <phill> medication effects on sleep duration; and inclusion of participants outside the age range of 18 to 60 years."
[12:15:40] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: i mean, sleepiness feels horrible. what about when you are sleep deprived and not sleepy?
[12:16:02] <phill> and i do wonder how many of the papers were assessing night time sleep vs total sleep throughout the day (including naps)
[12:16:13] <saturn2> uh... i don't think that's happened since i was little
[12:16:37] <phill> i hate the feeling of being sleep deprived and not sleepy
[12:17:01] <PapuaHardyNet> phill: really? what's the concrete sensation that you dislike?
[12:17:08] <saturn2> unless you mean being sleep deprived but unable to fall asleep? that's even worse
[12:17:08] <phill> usually due to some substance
[12:17:41] <phill> hmm, it's not a headache, but more of a head ache
[12:17:44] <linear> PapuaHardyNet: I left my client open but wasn't there lol
[12:17:52] <phill> like it's not painful
[12:18:04] <phill> but it's a global discomfort

[17:00:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: Those sustainability essays... can't say they don't make good points. But when I read the stuff about "social/political cohesion means we'll support each other in a crisis", specifically, here's what I can't help but think:
[17:02:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: In a time of crisis, *other* people, from other communities - ones not so high-minded and cooperative - will desire the resources you (together!) have, and will come to take them. Will your community collectively defend itself from them? Note: not "will the people of your community defend each other", but "do the members of your community consider it obligatory or even good to defend your community from attack"?
[17:02:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: Or does your community mostly instead consider it good or even obligatory to surrender and to aid those who want to harm you and take your stuff?
[17:03:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: Recent events incline me to believe the latter over the former...
[17:04:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> To put the point more broadly: it is all very good if your political/social views and the political/social views of your neighbors are *the same views*, but it seems to me that at least as relevant is *what those views actually are*...
[17:07:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is, again, not to deny any of the other points made about relative resource usage of rural vs. urban areas, etc., which are all solid)
[17:08:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course, the Peak Oil predictions remain just as amusingly un-vindicated as all such
[17:09:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> ~3 years after this was written, oil reached a peak price of ~180/barrel, then dropped and hasn't gotten close to that since
[17:11:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whereas the essay says
[17:11:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Some readers of my article thought I was saying that cities are paragons of ecological living. Please. Little in the US, let alone an enormous city like New York, is sustainable. Manhattan may use a bit less energy than some places, but the practice of pouring billions of tons of resources, gathered from millions of acres, into a few square miles to supply many million people in sky-high buildings is only feasible in an era
[17:11:39] <Obormot\Arcturus>  of cheap oil. And we all know that era is ending. When oil hits $200 a barrel, riding an elevator or pumping water to a 17th-story apartment won't be an option for any but the ultra-rich. I think the mega-metropolises like New York, Atlanta, Houston, and Chicago will decline as energy costs skyrocket. Some economies of scale become dis-economies when fuel is expensive." [emphasis mine]
[17:11:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "When", he says! Well, ok. Maybe someday. Maybe.
[17:12:21] <gwern> I didn't realize riding an elevator burned barrels of oil
[17:15:29] <nshepperd2> imagine paying whole cents per elevator ride
[17:15:46] <nshepperd2> the mind reels
[17:17:58] <gwern> one would think that solar electricity is already more than enough for such extremely efficient transport methods like elevators
[17:19:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Like any addict, we will fight for our fix. As the price of oil rises, hard-to-extract deposits will become worth refining, even in disregard of net energy yields (since large concentrations of money make it possible to temporarily ignore long-term economic reality). In August, Congress began authorizing states to drill in previously unavailable off-shore reserves. Record petroleum profits will be poured into new extraction
[17:19:29] <Obormot\Arcturus>  techniques. We'll probably -- sigh -- build a lot of nuke plants. And high prices will reduce demand and encourage conservation: SUV sales are already down nearly 30%. We've already cut back in response to high prices."
[17:19:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> So close to a correct prediction, and yet...
[17:20:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Nuke plants, hah! Well, at least this guy is happy, presumably)
[17:20:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Some experts estimate that over 90% of all resources are wasted by the time the finished product or energy is used, so there is plenty of room for upping efficiency. Simply by doubling car mileage -- which is within easy technological reach -- the US would cut oil use by 25%, taking us back to the consumption levels of the 1950s. Conservation is the cheapest way to create more resources." ... or... inventing new technology
[17:20:50] <Obormot\Arcturus>  and solving our problems thereby
[17:20:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why do people always forget that's an option?
[17:23:06] <gwern> only techbros believe in progress
[17:26:36] <capisce> Obormot\Arcturus: I guess optimizing one's life for a theoretical time of crises might require quite extreme measures
[17:26:56] <capisce> and few people are willing to take those
[17:27:10] <capisce> of course some people do some larping
[17:28:07] <capisce> also now with renewable energy getting cheaper and cheaper the peak oil worries seem less relevant
[17:34:04] <gwern> yes. we're not all *that* far away from synthesizing oil/jet fuel reasonably economically either. I mean heck the nazis could synthesize oil when they were blockaded, and we can do it way better to turn electricity into fuel

[19:03:42] <nshepperd2> energy per kg of avgas is about 100x that of lithium batteries so that might be a problem
[19:03:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, more on mayonnaise and the degeneracy of modern society:
[19:03:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If you want to be sure that what you're buying is real mayonnaise, look for the word "real" on the label. It indicates that the only emulsifying agent used in the product is eggs. If the label doesn't say "real," the mayo may use milk protein or vegetable-based emulsifiers."
[19:04:28] <nshepperd2>  44.65 MJ/kg (avgas) vs 0.36‚Äì0.875 MJ/kg (battery)
[19:04:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: How does that compare to regular automotive fuel
[19:05:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Yet Hellman's Mayonnaise almost never came to be. Richard Hellman, the German-born deli owner who gave the U.S. its most popular mass-produced mayo, almost traveled on the Titanic's maiden voyage. He chose a cheaper passage instead. "
[19:05:49] <nshepperd2> avgas seems to be about the same as regular gasoline or diesel
[19:06:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well... clearly this can't be too much of a problem, then, right? Since EVs exist
[19:06:57] <nshepperd2> i think it might be more of a problem for airplanes?
[19:07:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why so?
[19:07:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are EVs substantially heavier than gas-powered cars?
[19:08:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Some bakers use mayonnaise as a substitute for fat and eggs in a recipe, which makes sense given that mayonnaise is fat and eggs. " ... hmmmm
[19:08:41] <Otthorn[m]> there are already some project of solar planes, like solar impulse for example
[19:08:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess the garlic would be a little out of place in most recipes... but then, you can skip the garlic (or paprika or onion or w/e other flavorings)
[19:08:46] <Otthorn[m]> so it should be technically feasible
[19:09:04] <Otthorn[m]> but yeah, I also think that adding weight (battery) is more of a concern on a plane than an on a car
[19:09:06] <nshepperd2> i think EVs do spend a lot more mass budget on fuel
[19:09:30] * feep considers going for a hike
[19:09:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In much of Europe, mayo is the preferred fry dip over ketchup (remember what you learned in Pulp Fiction?)." ... the perversions of the Europeans truly know no bounds

[19:10:04] <feep> you know what, it's sunday, I've been poking at this compiler for four hours, fuck all ya'll, I'm not gonna go for a hike, I'm gonna go play dwarf fortress :p
[19:10:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Yeah I dunno, it doesn't seem like all that serious an obstacle
[19:10:52] <nshepperd2> but i get the impression airlines care about fuel weight a lot so it must already be significant
[19:11:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems like it'd be safer, too
[19:11:49] <nshepperd2> i think you have a harsher rocket equation regarding fuel in airplanes than cars
[19:13:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It largely comes down to cost. The priciest ingredient in mayonnaise is the eggs; while you may use an egg or two to produce a cup of mayonnaise at home, store-bought mayonnaise will produce an order of magnitude more mayonnaise out of the same number of eggs, with the help of ultra-powerful emulsifying machines."
[19:13:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> > an order of magnitude more mayonnaise out of the same number of eggs
[19:13:17] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the density and weight is very hard. that's why people talk about carbon neutral jet fuel. may just make more sense to either burn it and spend energy sucking co2 back down, or suck down & synthesize oil in the first place
[19:13:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Never forget that commercially produced food really has very little resemblance to home-made food, in pretty much every category you can imagine)
[19:15:25] <gwern> (makes sense. as the molecular gastronomy folks never tire of demonstrating, the flavor and texture has everything to do with the surface area and distribution, and very little to do with the actual number of grams. you can dump in a ton of sugar, but if it's all in big clumps, your tongue will never know the difference)
[19:15:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, of course, Kraft mayonnaise - the winner of the Serious Eats mayonnaise blind taste test - is also mostly soybean oil)

My kids love it too, they aren't allowed to eat on weekdays though so I give them a few scoops on Saturdays. If you add some to your bath it makes your skin feel really slimy and smooth, I don't think I'd recommend that though we have a bad ant issue because of that.

[19:21:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Soybean oil *and* HFCS! Truly the most American of all condiments
[19:25:39] <nshepperd2> my favourite part is that sometimes you find commercial food products that claim to be "genuine" or "home style" and if this was ever true they have long since been optimized into being exactly the same as the trash everyone else makes and the only thing the fancy label gets you is a higher price tag
[19:28:09] <rmmh> Rust was inspired by a bad elevator firmware https://twitter.com/graydon_pub/status/1492792051657629698

[19:31:03] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: so one thing that's been bugging me while debugging is that chromium keeps spitting out warnings about prefetch not being used. I took a look and on /newsletter/2021/06 /index /Screwfly /Changelog /tags/newsletter /About /GPT-3 , they all spit out exactly the same 5 warnings about 5 preloaded fonts not being used, which is... all of them, since we only preload 5. I...
[19:31:09] <gwern> ...originally assumed we just had specified too many, but they can't all be not using all of them, so it's broken. when I look in the network waterfall, it seems they are in fact being loaded *twice*: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16447678603513950.png under both names, the name + revision ID and the name. in inlined-fonts.html, we 'preload' them with ?v=,  but the @font-face drop...
[19:31:10] <Robomot> image/png (2160x3839; 772 KB)
[19:31:15] <gwern> ...the ?v=. there's a bunch of chrome bugs (apparently we should remove the crossorigin='anonymous', unless we actually need to keep it, or actually, perhaps the problem is using ttf instead of woff2?!) but my guess is that the name mismatch is the issue
[19:32:44] <gwern> in the waterfall, the ?v= version starts loading before the bare name, which fits with the idea that chrome is in fact preloading as ordered, but then also continues parsing the css, parsing the html, discovering it needs the bare name, ignoring the in-progress preload, and kicking off the bare name simultaneously, getting a redundant download since the bare name will always be outrun by the...
[19:32:50] <gwern> ...much earlier ?v=
[19:35:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm
[19:35:52] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: if I am reading the php right, the problem here is that the font-face uses single-quotes and the preload uses double
[19:36:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... what
[19:36:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> That cannot possibly make any difference
[19:36:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> What PHP are you reading that leads you to this conclusion
[19:36:29] <gwern> because the php does a regex rewrite on '"/static/...', and the preload is written 'href="/static/font', but the fontface is written 'url(*'*/static/font'
[19:36:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> ???
[19:36:42] <gwern> '	$outfile = preg_replace_callback('/"\/static\/(.+?)"/i', 'VersionAssetHref', $infile);
[19:36:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hold up
[19:36:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> What file
[19:36:57] <gwern> that php snippet is fom ./build/build_versioned_includes.php
[19:37:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, but
[19:37:47] <gwern> so the php which creates the 'versioned assets' tries to do the versioning by matching on "/static/...", and fails to do the regexp rewrite on the font-face because it's written '/static/...'
[19:37:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[19:38:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> That script does not do anything to any CSS files at all
[19:38:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> And so does not interact with any @font-face declarations
[19:38:17] <gwern> *something* is writing inlined-fonts.html!
[19:38:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, correct, that script is writing inlined-fonts.html
[19:38:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it sure isn't doing it by reading any CSS files
[19:39:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just rewriting templates/inlined-fonts-template.html, that's all
[19:39:37] <gwern> which has inlined css
[19:39:53] <gwern> and that inlined css uses single quotes
[19:40:03] <gwern> while the preload <link>s in the same file use double quotes
[19:40:20] * Obormot\Arcturus looks again
[19:40:21] <gwern> the double quotes get versioned. the single quotes do not. the php regexp specifies double quotes. so...
[19:40:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright maybe I'm totally misremembering
[19:40:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> One sec
[19:40:47] <gwern> I'd test it out myself but the autogeneration stuff scares me and triggers git merge conflicts and stuff
[19:41:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see what you're saying
[19:41:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're suggesting that the font urls in the @font-face rules should also be versioned
[19:41:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, fair enough, perhaps, but here's my question
[19:41:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, actually one sec let me check a thing first
[19:42:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, so: let's say we did this; but, fonts.css would still load the un-versioned font urls, right
[19:42:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wouldn't that cause the same errors
[19:43:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand, let's try it and see.
[19:43:32] <gwern> I'm not sure, but it doesn't *seem* to cause that. my working theory is that chrome reads the results and reuses it because it's named, but it just can't handle de-duplicating across 2 requests in flight independently of each other
[19:43:47] <gwern> because it doesn't yet 'know' they are the same thing and they are processed in parallel
[19:44:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Speaking of git merge conflicts
[19:44:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm nm
[19:44:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll return to that later
[19:44:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> For now, this
[19:44:29] <gwern> (I think either the inlined @font-faces must be versioned, the preload must be unversioned, or the preloads deleted entirely. as it is, we're wasting bandwidth, cluttering the console with distracting warnings, and probably even slowing things down because the two copies are taking up connections/bandwidth which could be used to load later stuff)
[19:44:47] <gwern> anyway if I'm right it's literally just replace the single quotes with double quotes
[19:45:50] <gwern> (there's a lot of "'/static/" in other files, but most of it is icons)
[19:46:19] <capisce> Obormot\Arcturus: it's really annoying that vegetable seed oils are in everything now
[19:46:36] <capisce> here it seems soybean oil might be less common though, instead it's rapeseed oil
[19:47:06] <capisce> which supposedly has slightly better omega 6 to omega 3 ratios, although it's still heavily processed plus the omega 3 is ala and not the bioavailable epa/dpa form

[19:50:42] <capisce> EVOO and avocado oil seem fine, canola/rapeseed oil might be slightly better than the other vegetable seed oils but still not ideal
[19:51:54] <capisce> but why not use butter, lard, tallow etc
[19:52:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: On the contrary, according to this canola oil has a *vastly* better omega-6:omega-3 ratio: https://www.cancerschmancer.org/articles/healthiest-cooking-oil-comparison-chart-smoke-points-and-omega-3-fatty-acid-ratios
[19:52:11] <Robomot> Healthiest Cooking Oil Comparison Chart with Smoke Points and Omega 3 Fatty Acid Ratios | Cancer Schmancer
[19:52:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, one of the best of any oil of any kind whatsoever
[19:52:40] <capisce> right, but the omega 3 in there is not that bioavailable apparently so not sure how it can compare to omega 3 from fish
[19:52:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that different from any other oil?
[19:53:28] <capisce> probably not, avocado oil also has ala
[19:53:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for butter/lard/tallow, well, for one thing, those all have totally different cooking properties from oils...
[19:53:45] <capisce> but I guess it's not just about the ratio, also about the absolute amounts
[19:54:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heck I only very recently even started seeing lard available around here *at all*
[19:54:27] <capisce> i.e. if you eat a huge amount of omega 6 then counteracting it with a bunch of omega 3 might be better than nothing but still not ideal
[19:54:33] <capisce> better to eat a relatively low amount of both
[19:54:55] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[19:55:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not using oils at all is not really feasible
[19:55:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can't substitute every culinary use with butter/lard/tallow

We define set-thinking as the practice of thinking about things in terms of sets. We define sets of arbitrary collections of objects, and infinity as not

[23:38:00] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: re: boiling water: the past is a foreign country
[23:40:40] <kuudes> afaik chinese tourists still prefer hot water, I have understood partly for hygiene reasons?
[23:41:11] <spxtr> much of the tap water in china needs to be boiled before drinking
[23:41:45] <spxtr> many of my Chinese friends still boil all of their water even after coming to the USA
[23:44:27] <rmmh> re:boiling water?
[23:44:40] <rmmh> spxtr: there's also the TCM view on drinking cold water vs hot water
[23:44:57] <PapuaHardyNet> rmmh: see the gwernpaste about British tea
[23:44:59] <rmmh> the insulated water bottles flooding the market are basically a domestic chinese product
[23:45:09] <rmmh> because nobody else cares about always having hot water available
[23:45:25] <gwern> chinese 'hot water' isn't necessarily boiling, though. and my understanding was that the hot water was like TCM itself in being Mao-era cope with communist poverty - avoid drinking expensive drinks or actual medicine
[23:48:24] <gwern> (at a time when you were heavily rationing toothbrushes and soap, it's helpful if the peasantry aren't demanding things like tea leaves or western antibiotics)
[23:48:53] <adiabatic> easy confounder detector: see if this is a meme in taiwan or hk
[23:49:34] <gwern> hk is part of china, and both regions had enormous post-separation immigration anyway

[23:50:24] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get it why the fuck would you do this
