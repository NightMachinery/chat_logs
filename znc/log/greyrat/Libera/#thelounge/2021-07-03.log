[00:54:29] <bookworm> I know
[00:54:40] <MaxLeiter> kk, just saw it was resolved
[00:54:50] <bookworm> as you can see there were no commits pushed, I fixed it up locally
[00:55:35] <bookworm> however xPaws "we can just remove that" is a bit more invasive... ;) quite a bunch of things uses it and that took me longer than the 10mins I had time
[00:55:56] <bookworm> I'm not very familiar with the code so it takes me a while to figure everything out
[00:56:23] <bookworm> and #$@& JavaScript isn't helping due to the dynamic typing
[00:57:16] <bookworm> half of the time my go to definition doesn't work and I need to grep
[00:57:28] <MaxLeiter> converting to TS is a eventual goal of mine
[00:57:31] <MaxLeiter> or at least proper jsdoc types
[00:57:56] <bookworm> yes. Which brings me back to the typescript book I've abandoned halfway in XD

[05:11:01] <eliocamp> They, let's say I want to create 1700+ users and what I do is create all the files on a separate folder. Would it be advisable to move them all at once to /users?

[08:28:13] <Aye> hi there! I'm making a few changes to The Lounge to change some things I have... a bit of nitpicks with, lol. I have done these changes code-side, but wanted to discuss it here if PRs would be welcome before I create them :)
[08:28:13] <Aye> - one of them is https://github.com/hellomouse/thelounge/commit/4dacaa46f37ac5a0b46076cf68e193e7eb5f2b39 - which uses MODES limit from ISUPPORT to send /voice, /op etc. in batches based on the limit set by the IRCd. better than flooding multiple +o when you can do +oooo :P
[08:28:13] <Aye> - the other one is a minor one, https://github.com/hellomouse/thelounge/commit/426841e6b7c00c11d9c1739c2dfd77b422168893 - it adds /umode, since I and a couple of friends find it a bit annoying having to switch to the server tab to set modes to ourselves. better have it complete after all
[08:30:22] <alyx>  /umode wuold be _nice_
[08:35:49] <MaxLeiter> Aye: both would be welcome
[08:36:10] <Aye> perfect! opening them now :)
[08:37:08] <BitBot> [03GitHub] (14thelounge/thelounge) [PR] JeDaYoshi requested 13#4274 merge into 07master: Add /umode support - https://git.io/JcEw5
