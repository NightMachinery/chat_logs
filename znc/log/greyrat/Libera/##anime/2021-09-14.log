[12:51:20] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus

[13:00:05] <DunceCotus> 'Hyperstition is a term coined in the 1990s to describe fictions that make themselves true.

[15:05:03] <amigojapan> darkwitch: they want us to overload those words
[15:05:15] <darkwitch> overload?
[15:05:31] <amigojapan> It's a programming term
[15:08:36] <Llamamoe> English, like all human languages, is a context-dependent language. The word is good enough, and has always been a gender-neutral singular as well as a plural 
[15:09:09] <JesseDesu> giboyrls
[15:09:40] <amigojapan> darkwitch: for example. In stone programming languages x=1+1 will make X be 2 but x="h"+"i" will make X be "hi" this is because + is overloaded. It means different things in different contexts
[15:09:53] <darkwitch> I don't see it as gender neutral. it is more like indefinite, not directly specifying who you are talking about
[15:09:57] <JesseDesu> amigojapan, is SQL all terminal commands

[23:36:20] <emmeka> MootPoot I start on Thursday. The oats need me.
[23:38:00] <MootPoot> Good luck with that
[23:38:07] <analoq> are there any cnc milling providers that offer their service like pcb printing manufacturers do?
[23:38:14] <emmeka> analoq yes?
[23:38:16] <MootPoot> plenty, just google
[23:38:19] <analoq> i.e. upload your file. get quote and gg
[23:38:28] <MootPoot> although they are very $$$$$$$$$$
[23:38:29] <emmeka> analoq this is literally the entire business of machine shops, which are everywhere.
[23:38:34] <cthulchu_> I actually really like dr stone for the immense respect to logic
[23:38:39] <analoq> emmeka: for b2b yeah
[23:38:40] <cthulchu_> damn I'm a big fan of logic
[23:38:52] <emmeka> analoq they don't care if you're a business or an individual.
[23:39:12] <emmeka> ofc, small production runs will be more expensive by significant margins
[23:39:24] <emmeka> but smaller machine shops might care less
[23:39:25] <analoq> emmeka: well prices between b2b and b2c are quite significant usually
[23:39:35] <emmeka> yes, expect to pay more.
[23:39:49] <analoq> ...
[23:40:11] <analoq> im basically looking for the jlpcb of the cnc world
[23:40:27] <emmeka> you're looking for a machine shop. there is no need for a simile.
[23:41:07] <Vohveli> I didn't even know GOAT as an acronym
[23:41:11] <Vohveli> thanks, Fubuki
[23:44:06] <emmeka> cthulchu_ Dr Stone reminds me of something. There was this French resistance fighter during WW2, Jean Cavaill√®s. He was a mathematician who tried to bomb German naval institutions and was captured, while imprisoned by the nazis, he wrote a book that was published after his execution: "Sur la logique et la th√©orie de la science" (On The Logic and Theory of Science).
[23:44:40] <cthulchu_> wow
[23:44:52] <cthulchu_> so it reminds you of the book?
[23:45:05] <emmeka> his obituary at his alma mater reads: Un philosophe math√©maticien bourr√© d'explosifs, un lucide t√©m√©raire, un r√©solu sans optimisme. Si ce n'est pas un h√©ros, qu'est-ce qu'un h√©ros
[23:45:29] <emmeka> "a mathematician philosopher, armed with explosives, lucid and reckless, resolute without optimism. If that's not a hero, what is a hero?"
[23:46:03] <cthulchu_> that's very inspiring :)
[23:46:33] <emmeka> I wonder if the mangaka of Dr Stone knew of him, because I feel like Senkuu would totally be into a book titled "On The Logic and Theory of Science", and he was himself a mathematician-philosopher armed with explosives, lucid and reckless.
[23:46:41] <davic> emmeka: still not hired sir? :(
[23:46:47] <emmeka> davic yes am employed
[23:46:49] <emmeka> as of today
[23:46:50] <davic> Vohveli: how is it across the water
[23:47:08] <emmeka> I'm a plant scientist. people are gonna throw money at me to derp around fields and measure plants
[23:47:10] <emmeka> it'd great
[23:47:11] <MootPoot> I want my obituary to say "Here lies MootPoot, he lived and died for anime pussy"
[23:47:12] <emmeka> *it's
[23:47:14] <MootPoot> or soemthing like that
[23:47:34] <MootPoot> emmeka: so you get a govt f150 and a drone and a mobile science lab
[23:47:55] <emmeka> MootPoot I get a MINI COMBINE
[23:48:09] <emmeka> they're so cute, the research plot combines

[23:49:45] *** Joins: Gabriel-1 (~Berliza@190.75.187.19)
[23:49:55] <emmeka> cthulchu_ it reminds me of the book, which sounds very Senkuu-y, but also reminds me of him facing off against Tsukasa while armed with gunpowder in a no-win situation.
[23:50:09] <MootPoot> oh, wait
[23:50:14] <cthulchu_> spoilers

[23:50:37] <MootPoot> can you get one of these
[23:50:41] <MootPoot> its cute
[23:50:46] <cthulchu_> but all this communist stuff with Tsukasa is annoying. 
[23:50:47] <MootPoot> drive it around with a combine attachment
[23:50:59] <MootPoot> what
[23:51:02] <MootPoot> communism?
[23:51:12] <cthulchu_> I would find a more refined villian than a dumb communist
[23:51:20] <cthulchu_> a bit boring
[23:51:22] <MootPoot> how is he a communist
[23:51:33] <cthulchu_> well he wants to kill all "bad" folks
[23:51:37] <MootPoot> ....
[23:51:41] *** Quits: Gabriel- (~Berliza@190.75.187.19) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[23:51:51] <cthulchu_> and he wants to stop progress to achieve equality or whatever
[23:51:54] <MootPoot> .......
[23:51:58] <emmeka> not for that reason, but Tsukasa's whole shtick is that he opposes the existence of private property, so
[23:52:07] <cthulchu_> lol
[23:52:15] <cthulchu_> pure communism
[23:52:17] <emmeka> his specific rant is about all the old men cleaving up the world and saying how it's "their land"
[23:52:26] <cthulchu_> yep
[23:52:40] <MootPoot> didnt he want like a big monkey man strong world
[23:52:52] <emmeka> yes, but also one without property
[23:53:02] <davic> Vohveli: when are you invading rushia
[23:53:08] <MootPoot> so a communist dictatorship
[23:53:12] <cthulchu_> ye
[23:53:12] <MootPoot> davic: I want to invade rushia
[23:53:17] <MootPoot> actually, maybe
[23:53:27] <davic> MootPoot: install HoI4
[23:53:30] <MootPoot> he said there would be no property, but did he say the state would own it
[23:53:39] <MootPoot> or just communal 
[23:54:59] <MootPoot> speaking of small cute machinery
[23:55:01] <cthulchu_> and yet this dumb piece of communist has enough understanding of what intellectual honesty is to know that Senku can't like to save his life.
[23:55:13] <MootPoot> I found a 2 stroke gas generator for about 50 usd

[23:57:08] <emmeka> cthulchu_ I kind of like how the whole thing with Tsukasa went. I mean it's pretty normal for the first villain in a shounen anime to 3,3get a redemption arc and join the good guys, but I thought the whole friendship between Senkuu and Tsukasa seemed actually well done and genuine.
[23:57:15] <ButterNoodle> no the generator
[23:57:38] <MootPoot> 1 sec let me put away my feet pics
