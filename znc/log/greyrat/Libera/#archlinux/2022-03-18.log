[07:20:46] <KillerWasp> It's a bit strange, as there are dependencies for different versions of Berkeley DB, but there is only one version available, so the dependencies are broken. It doesn't seem to be possible even with AUR. Is this an extreme system independent build? How to compile on your own in a separate directory and link it from there, as is usually done in experiments.

[10:03:27] <grawity> is that library using kTLS or just purely userspace TLS?

[10:36:14] <jelle> there are plenty of stow alternatives
[10:36:40] <grawity> I still suspect it's more related to the packet size
[10:36:50] <grawity> also, in your iperf3 tests, was the ARM board sending data, or receiving data?
[10:36:52] <powftw> is there any issues if i use `pacman -Rs` while removing any package?

[10:41:32] <grawity> so with nginx, it's the ARM system that downloads from nginx elsewhere, right?
[10:41:33] <uuidNuniq> -c -R also fine, 940Mbps, ksoftirqd using 1%. iperf3 using 55% 
[10:41:41] <grawity> or does it host nginx by itself?
[10:42:00] <powftw> let me conclude this. i can do `ln -s /my/source/dir /my/newdir/` to link `source` directory to a new directory, so whenever i change a file inside source dir, it will get reflected in newdir?
[10:42:27] <powftw> so, newdir should also have all the files that i have in sourcedir?

[10:52:02] <BrainDamage> on the acks
[10:52:16] <grawity> normally you shouldn't because rx and tx are physically separate
[10:52:22] <uuidNuniq> i tried ethtools to set up some parameters but it says not available or failed or stuff i recall. 
[10:52:26] <grawity> hence full-duplex mode

[10:53:32] <grawity> I guess it's a related concept but higher up the stack, at driver/queue/NIC level
[10:53:42] <grawity> rather than physical ethernet frames
[10:54:11] <grawity> I don't know how it really works under the hood, but I feel like I *have* read about NICs that only have a shared rx+tx queue

[18:02:09] <marcello42> BrainDamage: you can add specific points in your fstab. In the end this file is just a config file which will be read by mount. I'd recommend to use UUIDs though since using relative path ie /dev/sdc1/$PATH_TO_FOLDER /$PATH_TO_DESTINATION may fail when the initial mounting point in /dev changes.

[19:13:52] <mpan> I just checked the headers. It’s Arch Linux website that bans you from opening the file and forces Firefox to download it by sending `Content-Disposition: attachment` header.
[19:14:11] <mpan> So… no, it seems you can’t open it. Nothing wrong with your Firefox or configuration. It’s the website.

[19:59:34] <thrice> people claim support since 5.12, and you should generally just need linux-firmware
[19:59:55] <Scimmia> yeah, I saw that, support since 5.12, but the CPU was just announced less than a month ago
[20:00:43] <Scimmia> so something is off. I would guess it's simply too new and the kernel doesn't support it yet. You can try linux-mainline
[20:01:41] <Scimmia> might need linux-firmware-git as well, but this is all guesses
[20:02:41] <rmagno> okay, thanks, I am testing that now.

[23:09:01] <Scimmia> Bayes: `file /bin` should explain why
[23:09:06] <dav1d> Bayes, /bin/bash should just be a symlink (maybe even /bin, I cant remember)
[23:09:30] <Bayes> Scimmia oh, I did which /bin/bash which of course didn't make any sense :P
[23:10:26] <Bayes> so the one that is "correct" for my shebang is /usr/bin/bash  right?
[23:10:38] <MrElendig> /bin/bash is more portable

[23:14:37] <rcf> As far as I know systemd can't even operate on such a system anymore. 
[23:14:41] <hellosway[m]> but people used to do with disk space was a lot more limited
[23:14:59] <rcf> I mean used to, but it's not something you should care about if you don't care about portability to absurd niche use cases.
