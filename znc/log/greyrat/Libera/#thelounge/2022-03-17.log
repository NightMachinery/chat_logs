[00:45:20] <loungeCouch> Hi all. I got theLounge running but I cannot get notification to show on my Android phone when I receive a direct message.  Is there anyway I can make that work?  I read about the VAPID but I am not sure what to do with that on the mobile side
[00:45:55] <loungeCouch> on the desktop the notification shows up 
[00:46:27] <xnaas> What browser are you using on your phone?
[00:46:39] <loungeCouch> I am using Brave
[00:46:53] <loungeCouch> I have also tried Chrome but also not working
[00:46:59] <xnaas> Does Brave have the ability to "install" the site as a PWA? (share to home screen)
[00:47:16] <loungeCouch> yep, I have it running as a PWA
[00:47:17] <xnaas> and is your TL protected by valid SSL/TLS?
[00:47:31] <xnaas> either through a reverse proxy or through TL directly
[00:47:43] <loungeCouch> what's a TL?
[00:47:46] <xnaas> The Lounge
[00:48:01] <loungeCouch> oh haha.  It's a self-signed SSL
[00:48:23] <xnaas> iirc on mobile you need valid TLS for Google or Mozilla to send push notifications
[00:48:28] <loungeCouch> I also set up the notifications to "forever" but not working
[00:49:09] <loungeCouch> I can hear the notification sound, but no popup
[00:49:33] <loungeCouch> just want to see if it can show up on my lockscreen so I get notified
[00:49:37] <xnaas> Just to confirm...you did actually tap "subscribe to push notifications" in TL's GUI on your phone, right?
[00:49:53] *** Joins: wauterboi (~wauterboi@185.65.135.233)
[00:50:10] <loungeCouch> It says Warning: Push notifications are not supported by your browser
[00:50:19] <xnaas> then that would be the biggest issue
[00:50:28] <loungeCouch> oh
[00:50:55] <loungeCouch> When I tried that on Chrome, for some reason, it's saying that as well
[00:51:14] <xnaas> then the actual root cause might be the invalid (self-signed) ssl cert
[00:51:35] <xnaas> I'm pretty sure your lounge needs to have valid SSL for Google or Mozilla to send push notifications.
[00:51:48] <xnaas> I could be wrong, but I feel like I remember this coming up in the past.

[00:52:23] <loungeCouch> Does push notifications work if I self host TL?
[00:53:36] <loungeCouch> The notification works on my desktop browser, which is also Brave... that's very weird
[00:53:44] <xnaas> that
[00:53:53] <xnaas> that's probably just a regular notification and not a push notification
[00:54:06] <loungeCouch> ah
[00:54:25] <xnaas> push notifications would happen even if you have TL closed completely (but Brave still open)
[00:54:57] <loungeCouch> so on the mobile browser, is there a way to set up the regular notification similar to the desktop browser?
[00:54:57] <xnaas> And yes, you just need to have a proper certificate instead of self-signed.
[00:55:07] *** Quits: JanC (~janc@user/janc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:55:32] <xnaas> You would just have to always have The Lounge front and center, basically. Your phone will sleep it in the background no matter what, even if you setup exceptions, it'll eventually sleep it.
[00:55:47] <xnaas> Phones prioritize battery savings. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:56:00] <loungeCouch> that's true
[00:56:47] <xnaas> The easiest solution is to just setup something like caddy as a reverse proxy and let it handle valid TLS certs for you, but if you're never done anything like that, it is a lot to learn.
[00:56:53] <loungeCouch> how do I get a proper certificate?  Is there any free option available?
[00:56:59] <xnaas> Let's Encrypt
[00:57:16] <xnaas> typically people would use a tool called certbot
[00:57:22] <loungeCouch> oh ok.  Let me look into Lets encrypt
[00:57:38] <xnaas> Depending on how you have TL installed, you'll need to make sure it has read permissions to any certificates you get.
[00:58:25] <loungeCouch> ok.  Thanks a lot for your help.  I'll try LE

[05:58:27] <loungeCouch> ok. I'll see what I can do.  Thanks for the help!
[06:02:31] <xnaas> To greatly oversimplify: Push Notifications work by the OS provider providing a service for it. In Google's case, that's firebase or whatever they're calling it these days. No other service can push/send data to your device because that's how it's designed. If Facebook wants to send you a push notification, it still has to send data to Google
[06:02:31] <xnaas> through firebase which then actually send the data for the push notification to your device.
[06:02:46] <xnaas> That's my understanding of the process, anyway.
[06:03:20] <xnaas> If anything in the world could randomly send data to your device...imagine how awful that would be lol
[06:04:21] <loungeCouch> Yeah, I thought firebase push notifications is only for native apps.  Perhaps I misunderstood

[23:42:51] <captain_morgan> is there a build in mechanism to clean up old logs?
[23:43:06] <captain_morgan> keep running out of space on my VM....
[23:43:13] <xnaas> There's nothing automated.
[23:43:41] <captain_morgan> anyhing I can run? or is it SQL directly
[23:43:48] <xnaas> You could setup a solution using https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/wiki/Purging-logs-older-than-X-days as a guideline.
[23:44:13] <captain_morgan> oh yeah, that's perfect thanks
[23:44:23] <captain_morgan> now if the container would just respond.....
[23:44:44] *** Joins: deathbybandaid (~deathbyba@user/deathbybandaid)
[23:44:49] <xnaas> do not that if you touch the database while thelounge is using it, TL will crash and restart automatically
[23:44:52] <xnaas> note**
[23:45:05] <xnaas> best practice would definitely be to shutdown TL first
[23:45:08] <xnaas> and restart after
[23:46:02] <xnaas> Someone had worked on an improvement to the script on that wiki some time ago...but it looks like they never shared their knowledge with the rest of the world.
[23:46:07] <captain_morgan> eeehhh, kinda defeats the purpose of a long running background service.... but if its how TL do....
[23:46:09] <xnaas> A bit unfortunate 😅
[23:46:24] <xnaas> unfortunately an sqlite limitation
[23:46:24] <captain_morgan> looks like i have to restart at least anyhow..
[23:46:35] <xnaas> doesn't really do multiple connections/actions/transactions/whatever
[23:47:02] <deathbybandaid> just got thelounge authenticating with my local FreeIPA ldap, I have a secondary FreeIPA serve, and wondering if I can connect to both
[23:47:28] <deathbybandaid> most applications allow a comma seperated input for ldaps:// servers
[23:50:56] <xnaas> looks like PeGaSuS had shared this ( https://pastebin.pixelizez.com/view/5dfab536 ) in the past, captain_morgan
[23:51:34] <xnaas> though line 52 is a bit funny
[23:51:46] <xnaas> "restart" → runs "stop" — heh
[23:52:59] <PeGaSuS> that had a typo there :x
[23:53:30] <captain_morgan> cool thanks, but looks like i"ve got bigger fish to fry, running out of storage during an apt upgrade
[23:54:01] <xnaas> the most storage-friendly solution would be to disable sqlite logging and have 0 logs on reboot ;P
[23:54:13] <captain_morgan> yeah, think I'll do that
[23:55:15] * xnaas was mostly kidding, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:56:30] <fey> I just shove thelounge behind authelia 
[23:56:44] <xnaas> You also lose out on /search without sqlite logging, but if you don't care... 😅
[23:56:48] <fey> It has no say
[23:56:56] <captain_morgan> don't think I've ever used it
[23:58:57] <bookworm> also backlog when you restart
[23:59:23] <fey> znc Can solve both problems 
[23:59:40] * xnaas already covered that one, bookworm ;P
