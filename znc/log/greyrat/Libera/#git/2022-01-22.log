[00:30:33] <OnlineCop> I've got a Unity project where some files are .gitignore'd: `*.sln`, `*.csproj`. I want to have Unity re-generate the .sln and .csproj files for me, so I can compare how those files have changed from a fresh regeneration to what it is now. Would I want to `git add --force` those ignored files, push or stash them so I have something to diff against, generate the new ones, and when I'm done, restore those files?

[01:00:41] <eamanu> in the secondary you should add remote origin
[01:00:46] <eamanu> and then git pull origin

[02:22:05] <nickdiaz1wag209> i feel like sometimes the upstreams are set for me automatically because i dont have to set them very often. maybe a handful of times ever, and i interface with new repos (for me, but these repos have been worked on by other people for a while), pretty often

[02:22:51] <nickdiaz1wag209> i created a new repo, and created a new branch. The main has upstream automatically set, but my new branch doesn't. When I use "git pull", it tells me i need to specify which branch i want to merge with"
[02:24:13] <DoofusCanadensis> upstreams are set when you check out an existing branch
[02:24:27] <DoofusCanadensis> the developer needs to set the upstream the first time they push a new branch
[02:24:50] <nickdiaz1wag209> ah ok
[02:24:55] <nickdiaz1wag209> everything makes sense then
[02:25:16] <nickdiaz1wag209> if i blow away my current repo, and then just re-clone, it should have all the upstreams set up for all existing branches then
[02:26:02] <nickdiaz1wag209> and it does
[02:26:26] <mackerman> git checkout -b <branch>   # will do the same as git checkout -b <branch> --track <remote>/<branch>   if exactly one tracking branch by that name exists

[16:05:38] <clime> Hello, `git stash create` creates a dangling merge commit and the commit hash is printed to stdout. Can I take that printed hash and "put" that commit (perhaps with a new hash) on top of some branch? (not the current one)
[16:06:35] *** Quits: irc_user (uid423822@id-423822.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[16:09:06] <fireFlea> clime: something like cherry-pick? Although I am not sure you can cherry-pick a commit to a not a current branch :/
[16:09:33] <ikke> fireFlea: you can cherry-pick on top of any commit
[16:09:35] <clime> ye something like that, cherry-pick to another branch, yes
[16:09:37] <ikke> but it needs to be checked out
[16:10:21] <clime> i would like to avoid to any changes to my work tree in the process basically
[16:10:51] <ikke> maybe man git worktree
[16:10:51] <gitinfo> the git-worktree manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-worktree.html
[16:11:05] <j416> why avoid changes to your work tree?
[16:11:34] <ikke> git worktree allows you to checkout a different branch (and I assume also commit) in a different directory
[16:13:00] <clime> ikke: ye it seems somehow redundant to create that separate worktree but maybe there is really no other way
[16:13:27] <ikke> at least for now, merging (which cherry-pick requires) needs to have the target checked out
[16:15:05] <clime> j416: well, i meant i don't want to necessarily checkout another branch to my work-tree because i would like to basically: `git stash create`, then record those created changes on top of another branch. I would like to make this as atomic as possible. If I checkout something to my work-tree in the process and the script doing this gets interrupted then i might end up in some unexpected state.
[16:16:10] <clime> ikke: ok thanks :)
[16:16:14] <j416> ah, you're running a script, I see. that makes at least some sense, although stash also modifies your work tree.
[16:16:40] <clime> `git stash create` doesn't afaik
[16:16:51] <j416> oh, really. til. thanks.
[16:16:53] <clime> it just creates commit from the dirty changes which is ideal
[16:18:21] <clime> but recording those changes officially somewhere afterwards is not easy, it seems. i could do `git stash store <commit>` but I would prefer putting them on a normal branch instead of stash (because maybe at some point i might accidentally clear the stash or use to some other purpose...)
[16:18:29] <j416> you could create a commit and reset another branch to that without checking it out, if that helps
[16:18:36] <j416> (commit + branch -f)
[16:19:03] <j416> or, create a new branch, or tag, to point at that commit
[16:19:14] <j416> (commit + branch, or commit + tag)
[16:19:15] <clime> j416: ye but i think that doesn't keep history, i would like to do this repeateadly (many times)
[16:19:27] <j416> keep history how?
[16:19:38] <j416> ah, you want to contiue to apply commits on top of the same branch
[16:19:42] <clime> if I reset a branch to that commit, then the prev commit that I recorded there will be dangling/lost
[16:19:44] <clime> yes
[16:20:07] <j416> tricky then because of potential merge conflicts, I think
[16:20:27] <j416> perhaps worktree, as ikke suggests
[16:20:29] <clime> it's for testing purposes, i would like to record each state (i.e. keep its hash) that i am testing so that i can go back to it later
[16:20:51] <j416> I see. Why not commit each state on the current branch?
[16:20:55] <clime> ye, i would like to use git checkout --theirs -- . to resolve the conflict, so side-worktree is probly the best
[16:21:32] <clime> j416: because on the current branch i do some "normal" development, occassionally i get carried away and i won't to try some side things...
[16:21:58] <j416> I mean, for testing you could create a separate branch, check that out, run the tests
[16:22:19] <j416> if you need them to run while you work on your first branch, I'd go with worktree
[16:22:33] <clime> ye, it's easier to make a quick dirty change and test it quickly, i am not that disciplined :)
[16:23:24] <j416> I do temporary commits all the time, though
[16:23:27] <j416> you can just reset them away later
[16:23:38] <clime> but then they get lost?
[16:23:46] <j416> yes, they're temporary
[16:23:49] <clime> i need to record that state
[16:23:51] <j416> no need for them when I'm done
[16:23:55] <clime> ok
[16:24:10] <j416> if they're needed, I can just put them in a different branch for the time being, until I don't need them anymore
[16:24:36] <j416> point being, it's not a lot of effort to create/delete branches or commits

[19:39:14] <j416> except that'll break if someone force pushes to alter history
[19:39:40] <ljharb> git doesn’t have history, it has a changelog.
[19:40:08] <j416> so it'll be a guard against someone removing history, at the risk that you'll miss new history in the case of minor rewrites
[19:40:38] <j416> new history -> new commits*
[19:41:03] <TianruiWei[m]> j416: That's a valid concern. I should hope that they don't do that often so that I don't have to manually force-push them :) (currently done by a cron job
[19:41:13] <ljharb> rebasing and force push are powerful and necessary; thinking if it as history incorrectly attaches you to the incorrect idea that there’s a chronological order of commits that matters
[19:42:04] <TianruiWei[m]> ljharb: rebasing doesn't necessarily imply the need for force pushing though?
[19:42:32] <ljharb> not necessarily, but rebasing already-pushed things does, and that’s critically valuable too
[19:42:48] <j416> TianruiWei[m]: rebase means rewriting history, and you cannot push that unless you force push to overwrite what's on the remote, if the remote has the old history

[19:46:06] <TianruiWei[m]> ljharb: thanks for the warning, I'm indeed not a git guru. Could you perhaps share some resources on building the correct mental model?
[19:46:32] <TianruiWei[m]> ljharb: Not to worry, always happy to learn
[19:46:48] <ljharb> TianruiWei[m]: I usually share https://twitter.com/ljharb/status/261888019454386176?s=21 (read some of the replies to it too)
[19:46:58] <ljharb> “the case for git rebase” is an important one
[19:47:00] <mackerman> What other term would you give parent comments?
[19:47:01] <j416> ljharb: while that may be a valid argument, you're effectively saying that Linus's (having used the word history about git) mental model of git is flawed
[19:47:05] <j416> just, to note.
[19:47:31] <ljharb> j416: i don’t see any issue with saying that. Just because someone invents a thing doesn’t mean they understand what it’s evolved into.
[19:47:51] <j416> words mean different things in different contexts
[19:47:58] <ljharb> also, Linus invented git when svn and friends were the dominant model. “history” was the word people understood.
[19:48:15] <ljharb> yes, but they often carry connotations across every context.
[19:48:31] <ljharb> which is why anyone that’s anti rebasing will inevitably use the word “history” to describe a changelog :-p
[19:48:38] <TianruiWei[m]> ljharb: thanks for providing the link, I'll try to learn from the post
[19:48:40] <ljharb> altho the reverse may not be true
[19:49:19] <j416> to be fair, a log is typically an append-only record of what happened, though
[19:49:38] <mackerman> If I call a journal, is that better?

[19:50:09] <j416> er
[19:50:11] <j416> although, I use both history and log
[19:50:33] <j416> if you want a more accurate word, perhaps "ancestry"?
[19:50:43] <ljharb> nah that’s immutable too
[19:50:52] <j416> not in Git
[19:50:58] <ljharb> so far I’ve not encountered anybody who’s opposed to rebasing due to a mental model that a log is append-only, i suppose
[19:51:03] <j416> just as history is mutable
[19:51:18] <ljharb> j416: the non-git meanings aren’t mutable, and that’s what matters
[19:51:30] <j416> I disagree, but that's fine.

[22:21:56] <j416> epolanski: it would be easy to try
[22:22:11] <epolanski> I am but I cannot see the hook being executed :D
[22:22:22] <epolanski> and have to debug the reason, asked to make sure :D
[22:24:04] <cousteau> bug TL;DR: `git rm --cached a_submodule` doesn't stage changes on .gitmodules
[22:24:25] <ikke> cousteau: I don't see any follow-up.
[22:25:24] *** Joins: retroid_ (~retro@2e40edd9.skybroadband.com)
[22:25:29] <cousteau> yeah it was kind of messy, and the bug eventually bounced back to my old account so there must have been some activity
[22:26:03] <epolanski> okay something's definitely off with my git hooks j416 I've just created a stupid pre-commit with `#!/usr/bin/env node console.log("foo bar");` and it's not running
[22:26:16] <epolanski> how can I check which folder is git using for hooks?
[22:26:22] <cousteau> someone at https://coderwall.com/p/csriig/remove-a-git-submodule mentioned there is a `git-submodule-rm` branch, and provides a link for a gmane.org site that doesn't seem to work
[22:26:22] <ikke> epolanski: is it executable?
[22:26:43] <cousteau> What is the official repository for git as a software project?
[22:27:10] <epolanski> yes ikke, -rwxr-xr-x
[22:27:43] <cousteau> epolanski: wait, is that a single-line file containing a shebang?
[22:27:47] <epolanski> I think I may have changed `git config core.hooksPath` or something like that but I have no idea how to retry the value `git config -e` doesn't show the setting
[22:27:55] <ikke> epolanski: do you have core.hooksPath set?
[22:27:57] <ikke> ah
[22:28:02] <j416> epolanski: https://asciinema.org/a/S8QkxJUNLfOgX8UYsDdTlwADJ works
[22:28:06] <ikke> git config core.hooksPath
[22:28:20] <cousteau> or is there supposed to be a newline after "node"?
[22:28:22] <epolanski> two lines, formatted on one cousteau for chat readability
[22:28:42] <cousteau> ah OK :)  just wanted to make sure you didn't have an invalid shebang there
[22:29:48] <epolanski> yeah that was the issue j416 I tried to do `git config core.hookspath -e` thinking it would edit and it set `-e`

[22:45:10] <ikke> cousteau: there is no canonical repo
[22:45:19] <cousteau> aw
[22:45:26] <cousteau> well I guess that's sort of the point of git
[22:45:30] <ikke> yes, exactly
[22:45:43] <ikke> junios tree can be found at several locations
[22:45:48] <cousteau> you just push your branch to branch X in repo Y, and with some luck it gets propagated somehow
[22:46:16] <cousteau> across all "major" git repos
[22:46:23] <ikke> https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
[22:46:50] <DoofusCanadensis> git only takes emailed patches, iirc
[22:46:52] <cousteau> but I would think that there's one "main" repo that is used as the central one, and to which all branches end up pushed?
[22:47:10] <cousteau> DoofusCanadensis: well that's a bit weird tbh...
[22:47:11] <DoofusCanadensis> and the url ikke gave is the canonical root git repo
[22:47:32] <DoofusCanadensis> cousteau: git existed way before the github service introduced pull requests
[22:47:49] <DoofusCanadensis> and they continue to operate as they have done
[22:48:04] <DoofusCanadensis> changes accepted via emailed patches

[22:48:13] <cousteau> well, the link ikke provided seems to have the same branches as the github one, so I'm gonna guess they're mostly the same / in sync
[22:48:30] <ikke> yes, they are autatically synced
[22:48:52] <DoofusCanadensis> from the GitHub page: "Git Source Code Mirror - This is a publish-only repository but pull requests can be turned into patches to the mailing list via GitGitGadget (https://gitgitgadget.github.io/).

[22:49:36] <cousteau> DoofusCanadensis: I understand that git existed before pull requests, but that doesn't justify that they STILL work like that... I mean I suppose there's nothing wrong with accepting email patches if needed, but being able to submit PRs to repo X would be nice
[22:50:21] <cousteau> even if the PR gets canceled, and someone decides to just clone the repo and merge the PR branch instead, because they dislike github's PR system
[22:51:06] <DoofusCanadensis> well, Linus and the Git project are very opinionated
[22:51:33] <DoofusCanadensis> at least it's cool to see them provide a tool to turn a GitHub PR into something submissable to Git
[22:51:55] <cousteau> DoofusCanadensis: I don't see that at the github proj... oh ok, I was reading on the README file; that's in the github description
[22:52:05] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah
[22:52:15] <DoofusCanadensis> I pasted the contents of About
[22:52:43] <DoofusCanadensis> the Git readme is very unlikely to mention GitHub at all
[22:53:29] <cousteau> but my point is, isn't a proper git merge better than a manual email patch?  Or do email patches recreate the git tree EXACTLY, so that the end result will be as if the user had pushed their change directly to the main git repo?
[22:54:04] <DoofusCanadensis> they create a patch that looks just like a Git commit that you see in a PR or a branch
[22:54:15] <DoofusCanadensis> so they can be treated the same way
[22:54:20] <cousteau> yeah good point, I was thinking on it as "the github readme", but obviously it's just "the git readme" and having a separate readme specific for github would be a bit hard AND pointless
[22:54:43] *** Joins: fireFlea (~fireFlea@91.187.63.188)
[22:54:45] <cousteau> DoofusCanadensis: but they won't have the same hash, right?

[22:55:29] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[22:55:36] <j416> the committer name, e-mail, and timestamp will be different, so the hash will also differ because of thatr
[22:55:37] <j416> that*
[22:55:39] *** Joins: m0viefreak (~asdf@user/m0viefreak)
[22:55:48] <ikke> and the parent commit often is different as well
[22:55:52] <j416> nod
[22:56:08] <cousteau> so if the user who submitted it ever pulls from git, they won't see "oh, my branch got merged into the main git one", but rather "oh, there is a commit that looks a lot like the one I created, with the same commit message and same files and changes, but is a different commit"
[22:56:17] <ikke> yes
[22:56:24] <cousteau> pity
[22:56:45] <cousteau> that's why I was thinking that a "proper" merge would be ...less painful for the user

[22:57:25] <ikke> It's a different workflow, which is very effective for the git maintainers and the kernel maintainers as well
[22:57:36] <cousteau> Anyway, it seems that the "git-submodule-rm" they mention at https://coderwall.com/p/csriig/remove-a-git-submodule doesn't exist, at least not in the "main" mirrors
