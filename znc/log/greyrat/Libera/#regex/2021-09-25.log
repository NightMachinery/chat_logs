[00:17:56] <jargon> https://regex101.com/r/ckivLn/1/ Why does this only match for the "attkburn" Roe Collector Card combo?
[00:22:57] <jargon> Sup, OnlineCop, purplex and digitok?
[00:23:02] <purplex> because you don't have another line presumably "IF MID" in others
[00:24:05] <jargon> Well, I used (|^foo$)
[00:24:26] <OnlineCop> After those (|^foo$) lines, it expects a literal newline.
[00:24:42] <jargon> do I use \n ?
[00:25:14] <OnlineCop> The pattern can accept "nothing" due to the (| portion, but it still expects a newline before and after it.
[00:25:42] <OnlineCop> You may want to put '(' at the end of a line, put in the newline, and then put the |^foo$  immediately after that, so the newline itself can be optional.
[00:26:31] <OnlineCop> Or... you can put a `?` as the very first character on the next line so the literal newline is optional.
[00:26:59] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/ckivLn/2
[00:28:59] <OnlineCop> I like to use \Q...\E to match literal characters (including spaces and so you don't have to escape \ characters). But then again, I also like to use the /x flag so whitespace in the pattern is ignored. That makes it ugly since you have to match spaces as `\ ` or `[ ]` or `\s` or something.
[00:29:19] <OnlineCop> Also: you do NOT need to wrap things like (str) and (use) in parens.
[00:29:55] <OnlineCop> You only do that if you need those characters grouped for some reason (like you want to make an all-or-nothing match or a capturing group).
[00:30:44] <OnlineCop> It makes sense around `(attack|attk)` because you want it to match only if it's all-or-nothing of letters "attack" OR "attk" but not "a" and maybe a "t" and then maybe another "t" and then... (you get the drift).
[00:31:34] <OnlineCop> (|\s*) is useless: `\s*` will match 0 spaces.
[00:59:30] <jargon> https://regex101.com/r/Ed959i/1/
[00:59:48] <jargon> That better?
[01:01:04] <jargon> OnlineCop, it is for my Roe Collector Card project, notice I am making a basic stencil for the card behaviors.

[01:43:15] <jargon> This is the PHP that goes with the regex.
[01:47:45] <purplex> Any problem you're having with that regex?
[01:48:03] <jargon> It skips past the preg_match
[01:51:35] <jargon> I am using PHP8 and PCRE2 in XAMPP by Apache Friend's on Windows 10 Home x86 in-order to automate development of my game.
[01:53:10] <purplex> I'd use actual newline characters to match newlines, yours just uses 'Enter' not a nice way.
[01:53:26] <jargon> :O
[01:53:36] <jargon> I did not know any better! :D
[01:54:51] <jargon> Yeah I looked at the hidden characters in my pcre file, it has [CrLf].
[01:56:32] <jargon> I plan on using PHP8/PCRE2 to automated the process of developing the bulk of the data entry tasks required to get my game made.
[01:57:51] <jargon> purplex, how do I know if I did it wrong and how do I fix it?
[01:59:58] <jargon> All my project files use [CRLF].
[02:00:59] <purplex> I'd use \R (it will match CR, LF, or, CRLF) but if you want to be explicit about it use \r\n
[02:01:43] <purplex> You can use \x if you want to keep your regex still multi-line.

[02:03:16] <purplex> Me and OnlineCop like to use it. I use it personally without showing-off :P
[02:03:52] <jargon> I tried it, it broke my pattern.,
[02:04:09] <purplex> What have you tried?
[02:05:34] <jargon> I used the x flag.

[02:09:37] <purplex> The /x flag isn't necessary for it works, it's just a style preference i.e. to have a complex regex multi-lined for readability.
[02:09:56] <purplex> it to work*
[02:11:26] <purplex> I assume you wrote this regex, so I am assuming you understand what I meant :P
[02:11:31] <jargon> I can't figure it out. :(
[02:13:17] <purplex> Also, carriage return won't work on regex101. So, let me use \R to demonstrate.
[02:13:27] <jargon> Using /x just breaks it in the first place
[02:14:21] <jargon> This works on Regex101, but not on my XAMPP. https://regex101.com/r/Ed959i/1/
[02:16:00] <jargon> All my projects use crlf not lf
[02:16:14] <jargon> nor do they use bare cr
[02:16:25] <jargon> only time that happens is in binaries.
[02:17:39] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/Ed959i/2
[02:23:19] <jargon> It didn't work either.
[02:25:16] <purplex> Works for me in preg flavor. Are you including the flags?
[02:28:49] <purplex> Otherwise. Copy it as a single line, remove /x. https://regex101.com/r/Ed959i/3
[02:30:29] <purplex> Here copy this: https://regex101.com/r/Ed959i/3/codegen?language=php

[19:49:13] <sasho> Hello anyone knows if there is any difference in an empty group `()` and nothing when in a conditional like `(a|)` compared to `(a|())`
[19:49:50] <sasho> I've a fear of the first matching everything and so I use the second one
[19:52:27] <digitok> nope, they're the same. you should be using (a)? if you want to match a optionally
[19:52:44] <digitok> or (?:a)? if you don't need to capture it
[19:53:11] <sasho> the same - even in Perl?
[19:53:29] <digitok> yes
[19:53:41] <sasho> I need to use them in like `(?(<named>)|something)`
[19:53:48] <sasho> ok thanks
[19:54:29] <sasho> so they wouldn't match nothing right?
[19:54:37] <digitok> they would
[19:56:02] <digitok> they would match every position in the string where the first alternation doesn't match
[19:56:07] <sasho> ah ok I see it in regex101 now - it says 'null, matches any position'
[19:56:09] <digitok> assuming /g
[19:56:18] <sasho> I don't use g
[19:56:59] <digitok> ok, then just the empty position at the start of the string
[19:58:16] <sasho> OK thanks I think I see now - I was afraid of matching the whole rest string but I guess that isn't what's doing 
[19:59:14] <digitok> nope, but it's still not something you'd generally need to do
[20:00:49] <digitok> (?<foo>...)? will match ... or nothing
[20:04:55] <digitok> although were you referring to an actual conditional group? if so, the OR part is not required
[20:05:19] <digitok> (?(blah)true)
[20:07:46] <sasho> Yup
[20:07:53] <sasho> I want only the false
[20:08:22] <digitok> right, then yea just use nothing for true
