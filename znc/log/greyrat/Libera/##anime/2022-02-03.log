[02:57:52] <|xD> new mutation is diff
[02:58:15] <|xD> yeah it protects from ICU a bit
[02:58:16] <Terminus> meh, i don't even know if the update will get here.
[02:58:38] <Terminus> i'll take what i can get. more importantly, my vaccine card is filled up for maximum freedom.
[02:58:52] <|xD> yeah i had no choice at the beginning
[02:58:56] <|xD> now i can pick along many
[02:59:30] <|xD> novavax also comin
[02:59:34] <Terminus> my first and second shots were sinovac because it was difficult to get pfizer or moderna.
[02:59:43] <Terminus> oh yeah, novovax would be nice.
[03:00:05] <|xD> i will still prefer m-rna so
[03:00:12] <Terminus> if the pandemic dies though, i have no intention of getting a shot every year.
[03:00:24] <|xD> the mechanism is better i think
[03:00:41] <Terminus> this is the 1st vaccine i've gotten in ~25 years.
[03:00:57] <|xD> novavax needs adjuvants to activate
[03:01:07] <|xD> they arent always healthy :P
[03:01:32] <Terminus> doesn't matter anyway since novavax isn't widely available yet.
[03:01:33] <|xD> m-rna is just nano sized lipides
[03:01:37] <|xD> for transport
[03:01:41] <Terminus> so i'll just take moderna.
[03:02:08] <|xD> yeah but they overdose more
[03:02:14] <|xD> even more
[03:02:14] <|xD> :P
[03:02:48] <Terminus> gf needs the booster since her last shot was july. housekeeper's was august. mine was september.
[03:03:12] <Terminus> i'm the only one with sinovac. gf has pfizer, housekeeper has astra-zeneca. XD
[03:03:20] <|xD> hehe
[03:03:33] <|xD> i got j&j biontech/pfizer
[03:03:42] <Terminus> on the other hand, it took me 15 minutes to get my shot. gf waited 10 hours for pfizer.
[03:03:49] <|xD> and need 3rd shot too
[03:04:15] <|xD> lol
[03:04:43] <|xD> even with vaccines the pandemic cant be stopped
[03:04:51] <|xD> but at least you can reduce your personal risks
[03:05:47] <|xD> the future will be to live with it :)
[03:07:57] <|xD> Terminus: you can afford a housekeeper?
[03:07:58] <|xD> lol
[03:08:34] <psyomn> I do hope things can start getting back to normal again at some point.
[03:09:56] <Terminus> i'm thinking it'll just mutate to something less lethal at which point we don't really have to care about it.
[03:10:26] <|xD> Terminus: it is like that atm
[03:10:32] <|xD> but high infection rates
[03:11:25] <Terminus> on feb 10, philippines will allow all travelers entry and will only require quarantine for unvaccinated.
[03:12:44] <|xD> 21L omicron is also here now
[03:12:56] <|xD> new mutation again
[03:13:28] <Cryowolf> I don't know what people are expecting. It's a virus, it will never stop mutating
[03:13:37] <Cryowolf> because our immune systems force it to
[03:13:37] <|xD> yes was always like that :)
[03:13:44] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: its the PR afaik 
[03:13:45] <|xD> they question is if it gets worse
[03:13:46] <|xD> :P
[03:13:57] <Cryowolf> I doubt it will get worse
[03:13:58] <MootPoot> people were sold the idea "if we get vaxxed and if we stay inside it'll go away"
[03:14:05] <MootPoot> and we fucked up our chance at killing it early
[03:14:20] <Cryowolf> the virus will become a little more contagious but much less eadly
[03:14:24] <|xD> china 0 covid policy :)
[03:14:30] <|xD> lock everyone in for real
[03:14:31] <|xD> :P
[03:14:31] <MootPoot> so now people are getting angsty since they are still sold on "it'll end at some point" idea
[03:14:42] <|xD> it works ofc
[03:14:43] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, that would require the entire planet to do it, to control every single human being on the planet
[03:15:05] <|xD> Cryowolf: thats why it will stay forever
[03:15:07] <Cryowolf> or never letting anyone leave or enter your country again
[03:15:14] <|xD> Cryowolf: you cant control everyone at the same time
[03:15:14] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: well, dont t hink too much about it lol - I'm just saying what it was presented as in my personal interpetation
[03:15:29] <MootPoot> it seemed like everyone was sold on "get vaxxed and it'll go away"
[03:15:29] <Cryowolf> Okay
[03:15:41] <Cryowolf> not in Sweden ;D
[03:15:44] <MootPoot> lol
[03:15:49] <|xD> :)
[03:15:51] <MootPoot> go eat your IKEA meatballs
[03:15:54] <|xD> lol
[03:16:07] <|xD> they had bad experience with swine flu
[03:16:10] <|xD> and vaxx
[03:16:18] <Cryowolf> heck our specialists in the government were openly saying "it will mutate again but a vaccine will help you not get as sick and recover faster"
[03:17:02] <Terminus> damn. now i want to try ikea meatballs. forgot that ikea has been open for a few months now.
[03:17:19] <Cryowolf> I think 75-80% of our population are vaccinated now
[03:17:32] <|xD> Cryowolf: you cant say that
[03:17:47] <Cryowolf> why?
[03:17:57] <|xD> Cryowolf: vaccinated is time based if you wait 6-12 months you are not anymore
[03:17:59] <Terminus> our vaccination program got interrupted by a category 5 typhoon splitting the country in half. 😐
[03:18:15] <|xD> Cryowolf: so if you got your shot in 2020
[03:18:17] <|xD> you arent anymore
[03:18:18] <|xD> :P
[03:18:25] <Cryowolf> then that would show on their journal
[03:18:43] <Terminus> it's already been over a month since the typhoon and power companies are still working at restoring electricity in multiple areas.
[03:18:47] <Cryowolf> and they would receive an invitation to get a new shot
[03:18:48] <|xD> thats why they are boostering again
[03:19:07] <Cryowolf> they're lifting most restrictions in Sweden on Feb 9
[03:19:20] <|xD> and thats ~50% atm
[03:19:33] <|xD> at least here
[03:20:13] <|xD> and the world has big delays
[03:20:16] <Terminus> the latest spike here is just that. a spike. fast ramp up but it looks like a fast fall too. https://google.com/search?q=philippines+covid+19+statistics

[03:20:40] <Cryowolf> vaccines still help even after 12 months if they're the mRNA kind
[03:20:46] <Cryowolf> they dont help as much
[03:20:49] <Cryowolf> but they still help
[03:20:56] <|xD> Cryowolf: they dont help against infection anymore
[03:21:04] <|xD> Cryowolf: so you are spreading it too
[03:21:16] <Cryowolf> Why am I spreading it?
[03:21:21] <Terminus> singapore has timeframes for validity of vaccines. just can't remember what they are exactly.
[03:21:37] <|xD> Cryowolf: if you catch it you can spread it for a short period of time

[03:22:32] <Cryowolf> I'm extremely tired of letting this virus control my life. I have enough shit doing that
[03:22:39] <|xD> xD
[03:22:52] <Cryowolf> So I don't care anymore
[03:23:00] <|xD> yeah thats why the numbers always go up :P
[03:23:06] <Cryowolf> I'm not gonna go out and about if I'm sick, because I never do that
[03:23:28] <Cryowolf> yeah but again, so? Most people, like 99% of all that are in the ICU are the unvaccinated
[03:23:35] <|xD> nope
[03:23:40] <|xD> rate is 70/30 or so
[03:23:44] *** FreedomConniver is now known as Roey
[03:23:52] <|xD> i could look it up :)
[03:23:59] <Cryowolf> higher
[03:24:23] <Cryowolf> my statistics come from nurses working the covid ward and covid icu ward in the local hospital
[03:25:25] <Cryowolf> Of course 99% isnt gonna work cause there aren't 100 people there
[03:25:48] *** Joins: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat)
[03:25:53] <Cryowolf> I think she said there's 30 or so in the covid ward and 5 in the icu and all but one is unvaccinated
[03:26:03] <|xD> well you cant compare it everywhere
[03:26:09] <|xD> it depends on a lot of factors
[03:26:17] <|xD> age how ppl live etc
[03:26:40] <|xD> if your immune system is bad to begin with vaccines wont help
[03:26:58] <Cryowolf> Sweden is rather collectivist, we tend to do things like vaccinate etc, get booster shots
[03:26:59] <Cryowolf> and so on
[03:27:47] <|xD> hehe
[03:28:10] <Cryowolf> but at the same time we're very defiant to the virus, dont always wear masks :p Only reason I wear a mask is that I'm still a bit afraid to get sick right now. I mean my immune system should be back to normal now, I had my last chemo on august 15 2021
[03:28:15] <Cryowolf> but I dont have a spleen
[03:28:30] <Cryowolf> so comorbid bacterial infections from covid are rather dangerous to me
[03:29:42] <|xD> Cryowolf: sweden is ~2417 incidence atm

[03:35:12] <|xD> Cryowolf: thats ICU stats
[03:35:16] <Cryowolf> but my local hospital, at least today, specifically. Had only one unvaccinated admitted for covid
[03:35:30] <Cryowolf> err
[03:35:31] <Cryowolf> sorry
[03:35:33] <Cryowolf> vaccinated
[03:35:39] <Cryowolf> I got that backwards
[03:36:06] <lastonestanding> vaccinated means 3 doses?
[03:36:28] <Cryowolf> no it means at least 2 doses with the latest within 6 months
[03:36:53] <Cryowolf> since you get two to start with
[03:37:03] <lastonestanding> and someone who already survived covid once counts as?
[03:37:05] <Cryowolf> then a third 6 months later (unless youre in a high risk group)
[03:37:14] <Cryowolf> I dont know what they count as
[03:37:27] <Cryowolf> not vaccinated unless they're vaccinated
[03:37:43] <Cryowolf> maybe "antibody immunity on date X"
[03:37:53] <|xD> i got a server in sweden too but its breaking apart soon
[03:38:09] <|xD> 10yrs old hw
[03:38:17] <Cryowolf> indeed
[03:38:40] <Cryowolf> but Sweden is "openign up" on Feb 9
[03:38:43] <|xD> started with 10mbits BBB
[03:38:44] <|xD> xD
[03:39:20] <Cryowolf> they motivate it by saying that so many people are vaccinated and have been sick that resistance has built to a great enough degree that the hospitals can handle sick people
[03:39:31] <Cryowolf> that they wont be overwhelmed, which puts it on the same level as the flu
[03:39:42] <Cryowolf> in terms of that
[03:39:45] <|xD> Cryowolf: true but how about long covid?
[03:40:02] <ButterNoodle> wdym |xD 
[03:40:04] <Cryowolf> I dont know, that's an anomaly
[03:40:08] <Cryowolf> very rare

[03:40:51] <lastonestanding> it has been 2 years and no one knows yet?
[03:40:56] <lastonestanding> are you kidding me?
[03:41:03] <|xD> yes
[03:41:06] <Cryowolf> 2 years is no time at all to study a virus
[03:41:21] <|xD> vaccines take 10yrs to validate
[03:41:26] <|xD> normally or more
[03:41:29] <lastonestanding> uhm no

[03:48:26] <Cryowolf> and more oxygen
[03:48:38] <|xD> ice ages had no CO2 ppl
[03:48:38] <Cryowolf> because....plants eat co2
[03:48:39] <ButterNoodle> dino farts caused the Apocalypse

[03:56:04] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf: ur not wrong
[03:56:23] <Cryowolf> lastonestanding, how is it anecdotal if it comes from people working there that have the actual numbers? If you choose to distrust me or them, fine
[03:56:27] <ButterNoodle> its because we only have two parties to choose from /s

[03:59:25] <ButterNoodle> u stopped on regan right?
[03:59:46] <Cryowolf> nah I started on Clinton and stopped on Biden
[03:59:56] <Cryowolf> my knowledge (bar Regan) of anyone before then is zero
[04:00:48] <lastonestanding> I don't think that Biden is a puppet
[04:01:10] <Cryowolf> I know Regan used the DEA to funnel money into the federal government through seized property in the war vs drugs. I know he thought pot was the most dangerous drug there is and it would destroy society 
[04:01:17] <Cryowolf> and probably murder your parents
[04:01:29] <Cryowolf> or your kids
[04:01:32] <Cryowolf> or both!
[04:01:44] <|xD> will he do a come back?
[04:02:55] <|xD> all the presidents are criminals or rich bastards :P
[04:03:01] <Cryowolf> Yes. Afterall, all the powerful people in the world have access to to the lazarus machine
[04:03:20] <Cryowolf> so of course it will be used on Reagan
[04:03:22] <lastonestanding> btw
[04:03:28] <lastonestanding> "Germany, which has refused to provide weapons to Ukraine in the face of a possible Russian invasion, offered on Wednesday to send 5,000 helmets instead..."
[04:04:02] <|xD> haha yes a meme too
[04:04:02] <Cryowolf> Yeah they need the weapons at home for when they go for the 4th reich
[04:04:06] <|xD> xD
[04:04:29] <Cryowolf> they're preparing for it as we speak
[04:04:37] <|xD> beer helmets
[04:04:46] <Cryowolf> no they kept those
[04:04:49] <|xD> lol
[04:05:03] <|xD> there wont be a war i think
[04:05:05] <Cryowolf>  In WW2 they sent soldiers into war with meth to snort
[04:05:13] <Cryowolf> in WW3 they'll send em in with beer and pot
[04:05:16] <|xD> they depend on selling stuff too
[04:06:15] <Cryowolf> Sweden will probably be as neutral as in WW2 and sell things each side need to make machines of war, so we make them all buy from us
[04:06:18] <Cryowolf> and get rich
[04:06:21] <|xD> russia is only living of natural resources
[04:06:24] <|xD> if they cant sell them
[04:06:30] <Cryowolf> then proudly announce we were neutral
[04:06:38] <lastonestanding> I somehow have my doubts that the current generations in Germany are willing to fight for their country
[04:07:05] <|xD> lastonestanding: nothin is driving/flying anyway
[04:07:11] <Cryowolf> meanwhile we sold bearings etc to Germany, we sold some components to USSR and we sold information to the Allied forces on the west
[04:07:29] <Cryowolf> while being neutral!
[04:07:37] <|xD> Cryowolf: bearings i doubt we got the best :)
[04:07:37] <Cryowolf> I mean we treated everyone equally, that's neutral
[04:08:37] <Cryowolf> probably not and Hitler's men wanted to occupy Sweden but he had two reasons for not doing so, 1) we would destroy every single mine there was and then actively resist and 2) "WE VEER TRUUUU ARYANS!"
[04:09:17] <|xD> SKF / INA / FAG masterrace  of bearings
[04:09:43] <lastonestanding> and you had no resources
[04:09:47] <Cryowolf> we created a lot of utility items
[04:10:03] <Cryowolf> yes we did...We had a lot of rich mines
[04:10:12] <Cryowolf> still do
[04:10:35] <lastonestanding> didn't they go to Norway though?
[04:10:47] <Cryowolf> nope
[04:10:55] <Cryowolf> we sold them to the nazis
[04:11:02] <isekaijin> Cryowolf: “Dutchmen are true Aryans” didn't stop Hitler from invading the Netherlands, though.
[04:11:16] <Cryowolf> Norway kept trying to destroy our mines too
[04:11:46] <Cryowolf> isekaijin, that's cause Belgium was just so close that he couldn't risk it...There might be Belgians in there
[04:12:11] <|xD> Cryowolf: yes SKF is swedish :)

[04:17:08] <Cryowolf> resources that would make taking another country impossible and since Switzerland was neutral and basically just said "leave us tf alone to Hermit and stuff"

[04:22:38] <isekaijin> Oh.
[04:22:45] <isekaijin> Interesting, nice.
[04:22:47] <|xD> isekaijin: but you can do a lot :)
[04:23:22] <isekaijin> So QEMU looks like the ideal tool for, say, trying your own toy bootloader, right?
[04:23:23] <|xD> just add -vnc 0.0.0.0:0
[04:23:27] <|xD> then connect locally
[04:23:30] <isekaijin> Ah.
[04:23:48] <|xD> yes ofc
[04:23:50] <PancakeMatsuri> isekaijin, try virsh
[04:24:05] <|xD> virsh is another tool ...
[04:24:14] <PancakeMatsuri> isekaijin, not that I know it's better than qemu
[04:24:14] <|xD> to make managing vms easier
[04:24:24] <isekaijin> PancakeMatsuri: Thanks for the reference. I'll see.
[04:24:26] <klaxa> if you want a gui, use virt-manager
[04:24:30] <|xD> proxmox has that too
[04:24:40] <|xD> you can use the webui there
[04:24:59] <|xD> but just to play qemu cli is fine :)
[04:24:59] <ButterNoodle> isekaijin: "virtual machine manager"
[04:25:12] <ButterNoodle> proxmox is hot garbage
[04:25:25] <|xD> you can also forward smb share
[04:25:31] <ButterNoodle> libvirtd ez
[04:25:32] <|xD> for win10
[04:25:49] <|xD> proxmox is for a dedi :)
[04:25:52] <lastonestanding> how do you share the clipboard?
[04:26:04] <klaxa> magic
[04:26:15] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: use virtualbox or vmware workstation
[04:26:22] <|xD> lastonestanding: vnc can do that?
[04:26:42] <ButterNoodle> no spice?
[04:26:54] <|xD> never tried spice
[04:27:03] <isekaijin> Write to a shared text file, run a cron job that copies its contents to the X clipboard it every 20 seconds or something.
[04:27:11] <|xD> i gave up vms some years ago going with containers now
[04:27:14] <isekaijin> Stupid solutions that work.
[04:27:21] <ButterNoodle> |xD: u hipster
[04:27:26] <|xD> vms are stupid to handle
[04:27:27] <ButterNoodle> containers are for nerds
[04:27:35] <isekaijin> Containers are too complicated.
[04:27:39] <|xD> and need a lot of space  :P
[04:27:44] <|xD> na it is the other way around haha
[04:27:50] <ButterNoodle> ur doing it wrong |xD 
[04:27:59] <ButterNoodle> containers in ur VMs
[04:28:00] <ButterNoodle> ez
[04:28:12] <lastonestanding> isekaijin: "When a user clicks inside the Spice client window, the client mouse is captured and set invisible. In this mode, the server controls the mouse position on display."
[04:28:37] <isekaijin> Interesting.
[04:28:47] <|xD> i mean docker/podman is fine
[04:28:51] <ButterNoodle> yuck
[04:28:54] <ButterNoodle> u like docking?
[04:28:56] <|xD> why run complicated vm you have to update
[04:29:16] <ButterNoodle> u can run a dog shit container that u cant figure out when it breaks
[04:29:22] <|xD> all that qcow2
[04:29:46] <|xD> backup is much more complex
[04:29:48] <isekaijin> |xD: Do your containers allow you to run a completely different OS? (And don't say a complete different userland counts as a “completely different OS”.)
[04:30:02] <ButterNoodle> backup is hard if u dont understand it
[04:30:05] <klaxa> that's not the point of containers though
[04:30:13] <|xD> isekaijin: na i run wine in dockers for windows :)
[04:30:14] <ButterNoodle> containers
[04:30:19] <ButterNoodle> containerized apps
[04:30:27] <ButterNoodle> |xD: big brain
[04:30:34] <ButterNoodle> like all the big time devs
[04:30:34] <klaxa> and backups are easy, and nobody really wants backups
[04:30:38] <|xD> isekaijin: so you connect via novnc and start your windows stuff
[04:30:38] <klaxa> everybody wants restore
[04:30:58] <|xD> best solution so far
[04:31:08] <|xD> novnc is websockets in a browser
[04:31:10] <ButterNoodle> win10 -> WSL -> docker -> wine -> cygwin
[04:31:12] <ButterNoodle> on aws
[04:31:14] <|xD> so you can access it anywhere
[04:31:32] <klaxa> can you throw in java in there somehow?
[04:31:36] <|xD> ofc
[04:31:46] <isekaijin> Why do you need a container just to run Wine in it?
[04:31:52] * ButterNoodle steps away from klaxa 
[04:31:55] <klaxa> needs some log4shell spice :^)
[04:31:55] <ButterNoodle> thats too far dood
[04:32:09] <|xD> isekaijin: i run a dedicated x11 + novnc there so i get GUI
[04:32:23] <|xD> isekaijin: which i can remote connect via browser
[04:32:46] <|xD> a nice solution
[04:32:51] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[04:32:52] <|xD> or setup diff linux distro inside
[04:33:16] <|xD> and i snapshot via ZFS to backup

[04:33:41] <|xD> the networking is also easier

[07:59:10] <Nanobot> Didn't YouTube used to remember the quality setting when you select one manually? I swear it used to.

[08:03:33] <MootPoot> the only possible good reason I can think of using a SPA...and I'm really stretching the word "good" is mobile browser support

[13:12:52] <MootPoot> >In a study of hospitalized adults, compared with receipt of 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses, receipt of a third dose increased vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization among adults without and with immunocompromising conditions, from 82% to 97% and from 69% to 88%, respectively.
[13:12:55] <MootPoot> there is the science
[13:13:02] <MootPoot> :)
[13:13:27] <Sapphirus> Preventing hospitalisation is vastly different than preventing transmission or infection.
[13:13:34] <Sapphirus> Neither of which these vaccines do against Omicron.
[13:14:08] <MootPoot> >Early evidence suggests that a third mRNA vaccine dose elicits markedly stronger neutralizing antibody responses to the Omicron variant compared with responses to 2 vaccine doses

[13:14:47] <Sapphirus> Really does it? Infection data during the peak of infection here would sure make you wonder about that.
[13:14:50] <MootPoot> I'd take it just so the infection is not severe
[13:15:29] <Sapphirus> Having been infected with the original variant, the immunity I gained from prevented me from getting infected again.

[13:15:41] <Sapphirus> I was in direct contact with someone who had Omiron and didn't get sick.

[13:20:45] <MootPoot> 60%...what against omicron?

[13:28:54] <Sapphirus> Now I don't need it anymore and sleep normally.
[13:28:58] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: additional immunity from a vaccination just makes you safer against reinfection.
[13:29:07] <amigojapan> Hey DunceCotus  Sapphirus 
[13:29:20] <amigojapan> Hey KatrinValerie 
[13:29:24] <KatrinValerie> Hi
[13:29:27] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, onee-san <3
[13:29:31] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, and I trust my natural immunity from my prior infection enough to quote 'risk it'.
[13:29:33] <DunceCotus> hi guys
[13:29:43] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: immunity from vaccination is natural too
[13:29:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its becoming like winter over here again
[13:29:52] <DunceCotus> after a humid heat wave :P
[13:29:56] <Sapphirus> So far, so good. I was in close contact with someone who tested positive over Christmas (Omicron) and I never got sick.
[13:30:06] * Sadale pretending to be Russian troll
[13:30:09] <KatrinValerie> Your immune system does the same thing as with a real virus, just that the exposure to the virus protein is more controlled.
[13:30:14] <Sadale> vaccine bad! It causes autism! Don't take vaccine!
[13:30:32] * MootPoot is making coffee
[13:30:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think we are over the peak of winter here now. It at least snowed once
[13:30:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we're getting another heat wave in the next two weeks it seems
[13:31:06] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot 
[13:31:07] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but it won't be as humid it seems
[13:31:27] <KatrinValerie> Btw that twitter account I linked earlier is a good source for accurate up to date info 
[13:31:28] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: one thing you haven't explained is why you aren't taking the vaccine... I assume you aren't afraid of needles: so there is likely something preventing you from doubling up with your natural immunity 
[13:31:35] <amigojapan> Ouch DunceCotus .I hope you have AC
[13:31:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I have a fan
[13:31:50] <MootPoot> Are you also in the club that thinks the vaccine has sekrit side effects? 
[13:31:56] <MootPoot> amigojapan: hai
[13:31:58] <KatrinValerie> The account belongs to a researcher who worked on the development of the Moderna vaccine
[13:32:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japan that's not enough
[13:32:26] <DunceCotus> whenever someone says "do your research" I'm a bit wary
[13:32:51] <KatrinValerie> She has tons of good sources and carefully explains stuff
[13:32:59] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: it means they haven't done their own well enough to present their case to you :]

[13:33:21] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, some of it is a matter of principle. Other reasons include, not wanting to risk a negative immune reaction (since I already had it) given my medical diagnosis.
[13:33:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I'll bet
[13:33:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sometimes its not enough here either
[13:33:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: particularly when its humid heat
[13:33:37] <Sapphirus> Even if the principle wasn't there, the latter reason would still exist.
[13:33:41] <MootPoot> Principle? What principle? 
[13:34:04] <DunceCotus> pareto?
[13:34:08] <S_T_A_N> The principle of not following good sense and science 
[13:34:12] <amigojapan> Yeah DunceCotus 100 precent humidity is common in summer here
[13:34:23] <MootPoot> amigojapan: take it to 11
[13:34:25] <Sapphirus> Immune system of mine can overreact sometimes and I got fairly sick with COVID comparatively to others in my cohort.
[13:34:31] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: If you are comfortable sharing it, what's that diagnosis that is making the vaccine more risky for you?

[13:35:13] <S_T_A_N> 100% humidity!? Isn't that literally underwater!? kappa
[13:35:34] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: apparently not
[13:35:42] <KatrinValerie> If you don't want to share it, I recommend looking into what the big expert association in the medical field of your problem have to say about it.
[13:36:14] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, I choose not to share since this is a very public channel. It acutely affects my immune system (was sick a lot as a kid) and screws with my gut.
[13:36:28] <DunceCotus> I think it means 100% of air particles has at least one molecule of water
[13:36:30] <DunceCotus> or some sheeeit
[13:36:39] <MootPoot> Before that... I accept some people can't take it... But what fuckin principle? 
[13:36:44] <Sapphirus> Doesn't impair function per se so much as it makes it react differently.
[13:36:47] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: so it's an auto immune disorder?
[13:36:52] <S_T_A_N> It means the air has all the water it can possibly hold 
[13:36:58] <KatrinValerie> Hear they especially recommend the vaccine to those with conditions like that
[13:37:13] <KatrinValerie> Especially if your immune system is repressed from medication.
[13:37:35] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, it's not an autoimmune disorder, I wouldn't say. Rather it's a genetic defect in how my immune system operates.
[13:37:35] <KatrinValerie> Even though the vaccines aren't as effective in this situation, they still masively reduce the risks associated with an infection.
[13:37:36] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: I wonder what's the humidity in a foggy day
[13:37:53] <DunceCotus> what's the humidity, Kenneth?
[13:38:05] <S_T_A_N> idk why y'all are still engaging the troll. If they were actually immunocomprimsed they would have lead with that, not I already safe because I got it etc etc
[13:38:40] <Sapphirus> I wish I were trolling, because then I wouldn't have had to live with being sick with everything as a kid.
[13:38:45] <Sapphirus> From strep throat to swine flu.
[13:38:51] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: what principle 
[13:39:00] <S_T_A_N> they are just reaching for anything that lets them not look like what they are
[13:39:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: 1000%
[13:39:17] <amigojapan> Lol DunceCotus 
[13:39:25] <KatrinValerie> Please don't pile onto them like that
[13:39:26] <DunceCotus> 10 waters per air particle
[13:39:36] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, being against mandates and the tribalism associated with people pushy about the vaccine.
[13:39:37] <KatrinValerie> You don't know if their doctor recommended against a vaccination.
[13:39:42] <Sapphirus> S_T_A_N is a perfect exemplar of this.
[13:39:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: foggy days are rare here, but I will try to look it up on one
[13:40:14] <KatrinValerie> And some people chose to trust their doctors, even when they are of a different opinion than most other doctors.
[13:40:17] <MootPoot> Only one of those is a principle... And afaik you aren't being mandated to get it so that entire angle is void 
[13:40:21] <DunceCotus> froggy trays
[13:40:28] <KatrinValerie> It could also be a legitimate reason that we just do not know about.
[13:40:30] <S_T_A_N> KatrinValerie: If that was the case they would not be actively trying to discredit the vaccine as a whole and they would have lead with that .
[13:40:36] <KatrinValerie> But I doubt it
[13:40:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: plenty of frogs around here
[13:40:46] <MootPoot> Are you a healthcare worker, trucker, or anybody who's been mandated to get it for their job? 
[13:40:49] <mixfix41> where are the mangoes
[13:41:01] <KatrinValerie> S_T_A_N: I missed that part, I just saw that they were worried about the vaccine because of how their covid infection played out

[13:44:41] <KatrinValerie> Infections with earlier variants aren't as effective against omicron either, from what I read.
[13:45:05] <KatrinValerie> The vaccine still beats the infection in terms of protection, I don't get your point Sapphirus.
[13:45:13] <Sapphirus> Not as effective, but still do provide protection against infection, from what I'm aware.

[15:20:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I really want to try it
[15:21:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but they're not being manufactured anymore so they're really expensive (not that they were that much cheaper when they were manufacturing them)
[15:21:18] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: well I guess buy one

[15:21:35] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus

[15:21:54] <DunceCotus> ebay
[15:22:29] <DunceCotus> its quite the investment into the world of the ultrasonic neural stimulation
[15:22:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if it really bypasses the ear, it could help people hear who are deff , without surgery
[15:23:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe build your own
[15:23:09] <DunceCotus> apparently it can help deaf people hear
[15:23:15] <DunceCotus> but its still really quiet
[15:23:26] <DunceCotus> its better for meditation and flow-state I think
[15:23:41] <DunceCotus> 'build your own'
[15:24:17] <amigojapan> Why not DunceCotus 
[15:24:40] <DunceCotus> difficult, expensive
[15:24:49] <DunceCotus> time consuming
[15:24:56] <DunceCotus> effort requiring
[15:25:09] <DunceCotus> plenty of reasons to not build my own
[15:25:12] <amigojapan> Probably less expensive than 650usd
[15:25:27] <DunceCotus> sure if I can source all the right parts
[15:25:30] <amigojapan> Then you could sell them for less
[15:25:41] <DunceCotus> but then to put it together, testing and tweaking etc.
[15:25:50] <DunceCotus> might end up with just a hunk of useless junk
[15:26:52] <amigojapan> He says it generates waves in , 3400hertz or something like that, let me rewatched

[15:35:21] <DunceCotus> It improves concentration."
[15:35:27] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: AUM had a similar thing they set on people's heads says tomako
[15:35:49] <DunceCotus> Subjectively, of course, and no double-blind tests have been done by me, nor am I set up to do any kind of clinical trials. To be sure it also may do other things if you modulate the signal but — I’m gonna keep this one as simple as can be.
[15:35:49] <DunceCotus> It is quite effective at doing the concentration thing. The downside is the effect works both ways. While I find I’m much more able to concentrate on things I don’t particularly want to do
[15:36:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: "
[15:36:46] <DunceCotus> As widely claimed, I find it does indeed make meditation and the like easier. At the same time it seems to decrease the “stickiness” of suggestions. In short, the Neurophone seems to do to consciousness what vigorous shaking does to a bottle of ketchup… it makes things more fluid and less viscous."

[15:42:18] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you need to remain skeptical

[17:38:37] <ezekielnoob> i agree
[17:38:51] <ezekielnoob> but i think we just have to admit the amount of processing/energy required to decentralize things
[17:39:00] <ezekielnoob> is way more than what we have right now
[17:39:00] <Sadale> why using blockchain? Because that's how you get all those fintech fundings :P
[17:39:11] <proppotatoxel[m]> Sadale: hm
[17:39:19] <Sadale> It's the new Y2K problem. It's profitable. And everyone's hyped over that. xD
[17:39:27] <ezekielnoob> Sadale that's what i think also
[17:39:32] <proppotatoxel[m]> well i dont play mmos so neh
[17:39:40] <ezekielnoob> it's gonna be more hyped and eventually burst into sanity
[17:41:09] <ezekielnoob> people are really paying for the hype right now, and especially demonstrated with NFT art
[17:41:16] <proppotatoxel[m]> but i could decentralize it but no way to trust inventory data other than blockchain. even then obtaining items can still be untrustable. it needs more than that
[17:42:10] <KatrinValerie> ezekielnoob: it just mimics the real art market lol
[17:42:11] <proppotatoxel[m]> just something i think about for fun. im not gonna do et really. im just making a dum tabeeltop thing in godot
[17:42:25] <ezekielnoob> KatrinValerie you are right tho
[17:42:26] <KatrinValerie> The art market has always been a way to launder money for rich people
[17:42:41] <Sadale> I hope that shit would burst info sanity. Otherwise this world would become like super inefficient with all those useless blockchain around

[18:27:48] <KatrinValerie> also I find the idea endearing that we are all basically part of a fractal and that is uniformly true for everything in existence and never changes. So there are inert properties to us that don't even change in death.

[19:06:06] <KatrinValerie> in reality it's just forcing the kids to mask
[19:06:40] <rando25892> i did some volunteer work in a ski program where we would chaperone along with parents kids who couldnt ski alone it was pretty cool because we got free ski lift tickets for participation
[19:06:41] <KatrinValerie> Don't get me wrong, masking is useful in some situations, but we should never teach a kid that they need to hide who they are.
[19:08:01] <KatrinValerie> It's just that autistics will always need at least a small degree of accomodation for successful interactions with neurotypicals.
[19:08:50] <KatrinValerie> Hiding away that you do not understand certain social cues and playing pretend all the time is exhausting and leads to severe mental health consequences.
[19:08:58] <rando25892> honestly i was new to the program but the brothers we were involve with didnt need any help skiing. its just autism really cuts the intellect potential rather then a simple task such as knowing to ski
[19:09:10] <KatrinValerie> And to a degree society itself performs this on autistic or rather neurodiverse kids in general
[19:09:38] <KatrinValerie> rando25892: autism doesn't always mean impaired intellect
[19:09:52] <KatrinValerie> Or rather I wouldn't even assume that with non-verbal autists
[19:09:55] <rando25892> well they had autism. its just they were good skiiers

[19:10:21] <KatrinValerie> Our inteligence is often heavily underestimated, because of how poorly adapted the enducation sector is to our needs.
[19:10:30] <rando25892> true. but its good to bring the kids out there for a change thats for sure ;p
[19:10:42] <KatrinValerie> Things like neonlighting can make a classroom inaccessable
[19:10:50] <KatrinValerie> Things you wouldn't think about
[19:11:22] <KatrinValerie> rando25892: for me a buzzing neonlight is enough distraction to make a classroom torture

[22:31:24] <Bco1981> 3200mhz cl14 ?
[22:36:27] <Bco1981> guess my son will have to settle with 3200, cl16... they are half the price...
[22:36:41] <Bco1981> even less then half

[22:41:48] <KatrinValerie> My wireless network just died, I apologize.
[22:42:26] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: I think it's corsair vengance but I think it's only 2000 something mhz
[22:47:15] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: DDR4-2133 CL13/15/15/28 8GB each
[22:47:57] <KatrinValerie> what's more important clock latency or frequency?
[22:48:25] <Bco1981> ah, sorry, has to be faster. amd 5000 series really likes fast ram.
[22:48:31] <Bco1981> it's a mix of both
[22:48:32] <KatrinValerie> meow
[22:48:43] <Bco1981> high frequency, low clock latency
[22:48:59] <KatrinValerie> I wish you would've bought em, I am broke
[22:49:41] <Bco1981> yeah unfortunately i don't have a build that would fit those.
