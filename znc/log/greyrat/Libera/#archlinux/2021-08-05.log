[02:19:10] <grawity> sounds useful

[02:19:42] <Foxboron> Or well, if you can get the BIOS password you can disable secure boot
[02:19:45] <grawity> I'm guessing you're supposed to have a settings password along with it
[02:20:01] <grawity> because otherwise you can just disable SB in general
[02:20:01] <Foxboron> but *how* does the UEFI firmware allow you to enroll info to the db if the private key is not *on* the device
[02:20:14] <grawity> why would it need the private key of something
[02:20:15] <Foxboron> and if I enroll my own, would it still work?
[02:20:35] <Foxboron> grawity: appends to the db variable replies a valid EFI_AUTHENTICATION_VARIABLE
[02:20:41] <Foxboron> requires*
[02:20:50] <Foxboron> which needs to be signed by the KEK private key in this case
[02:21:10] <grawity> the firmware is what manages/stores the db in the first place, it's already in a privileged position due to being able to switch to setup mode with just physical presence (without PK)
[02:21:36] <grawity> so I'm assuming they just bypass the check if it's the "trusted" settings app doing it

[03:28:20] <derzahl> hm, so ive got an encrypted swap partition i want to use for hibernate. I would like to use a keyfile stored on my encrypted ZFS root.  But even though i have the openswap initcpio hook after zfs, it looks like the "filesystems" hook is what actually unlocks my ZFS root?  because im not getting a prompt enter the passphrase until after the zfs, encrypt,openswap, and resume hooks have run. weird

[16:12:27] <klf> Namarrgon: you are right; xrandr reports all connected monitors when I moved xorg.conf
[16:12:33] <klf> 06:58 < Namarrgon> the driver can interfere, especially when you use xineram it may hide how many displays are actually connected to the system
[16:12:43] <klf> so I am just going to assume that's the issue.

[17:40:28] <tirnanog> not as such. you'd need to use a UDP-based service (DNS being an obvious example), which rules out the "arbitrary" component of the question.

[17:41:11] <sharperguy__> yeah i guess i will setup a remote server. I found a tool called irtt which seems to make that easy

[17:43:53] <phrik> sly_hrd: Quite possibly. Why do you ask?
[17:44:20] <speak> sly_hrd: But yes, I'm sure many of us do. I started with almost vanilla vim but have accumulated a few plugins over the years.
[17:44:46] <SysGhost> sly_hrd: it is as simple as searching for "vim plugins for <insert your favourite programming language here>"
[17:44:47] <sharperguy__> grazzolini, im just trying to test the delay of a UDP packet vs an ICMP packet
[17:45:03] <sharperguy__> but i think i answered my own question
[17:45:26] <grazzolini> sharperguy__: the RTT should be the same, I don't understand what you get with an "UDP" ping
[17:45:29] <SysGhost> sly_hrd: that is how I do it every time I need something. I often then look for the git or wiki pages about the plugin that I see as interesting.
[17:45:46] <sly_hrd> I've been using vim for a long time now, but I'll probably have to learn a bit of Python for a new job, I wonder if vim if sufficient for day-to-day coding or if I should consider some IDE @speak, @phrik, @SysGhost 
[17:46:12] <sharperguy__> grazzolini, in theory yes but in practice maybe not
[17:46:20] <speak> sly_hrd imo it's enough. I use it for my web dev work.
[17:46:44] <SysGhost> sly_hrd: it is. Most people using vim and the variants set up multiple terminals in a tiling window manager to get a good "IDE" environment.
[17:46:50] <speak> But I wouldn't recommend just sticking a bunch of plugins in that other people recommend, just add stuff in as you need them
[17:47:08] <speak> SysGhost: Boo lol, I just use one vim instance personally
[17:47:26] <speak> Oh right I see what you're saying, nevermind. Yeah I use tmux for that sort of thing
[17:47:30] <SysGhost> speak: multiple terminals. Multiple screens. multitasking \o/
[17:47:30] <sly_hrd> yeah, I use i3, I've written a lot of ansible, bash, terraform scripts in vim and I'd like to continue using it for other languages, thank you
[17:47:44] <SysGhost> speak: so easy to get code back and forth that way.
[17:47:49] <grazzolini> sharperguy__: unless your UDP service really, really suck, there shouldn't be any difference. anyway, setup an UDP ping service.
[17:47:52] <speak> SysGhost: Yeah for sure
[17:48:19] <speak> My main plugin for vim for programming specifically is ALE. Love that thing. Provides jumping into function definitions etc very nicely.

[19:43:45] <grazzolini> quantum_: nouveau doesn't get in the way because it's blacklisted. however, I think what you need is early kms
[19:43:55] <grazzolini> quantum_: you need to add the nvidia modules to the initramfs
[19:44:09] <grazzolini> that'll (possibly) prevent the blank screen on xorg
