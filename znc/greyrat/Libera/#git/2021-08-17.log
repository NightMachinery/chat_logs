[00:07:35] <nedbat> node1: it doesn't use any SQL, if that is what you mean
[00:08:11] <j416> node1: git uses a proprietary storage format.
[00:08:24] <ikke> bespoke :P
[00:08:36] <j416> meh
[00:08:36] <nedbat> artisanal?
[00:08:42] <j416> handcrafted
[00:09:09] <osse> bespoke sounds like something you to do something who's run out of spokes
[00:09:17] <osse> *someone who's
[00:09:54] <j416> someone who's you to do
[00:11:54] <node1> I have not said SQL. I said NoSQL( where data is being stored on versioning with  key value pair)
[00:12:33] <nedbat> node1: git doesn't use an existing database, it uses its own storage format.
[00:13:10] <nedbat> node1: here's a short overview with links to longer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8266871/git-repository-internal-format-explained
[00:13:36] <ikke> node1: the term nosql can be interpreted very broadly
[00:13:39] <nedbat> node1: they are key/value in the sense that file data (values) are accessed by their hashes (keys)
[00:13:44] <ikke> even a csv file can be called nosql
[00:14:24] <mackerman> git is content addressable object storage.
[00:14:53] <node1> yes
[00:15:04] <node1> thank you ikke nedbat j416

[03:02:20] <Gabin> rewt: how do you specify the local /from/ the remote?
[03:02:40] <j416> Gabin: regular ssh
[03:03:23] <j416> Gabin: you can also go the other way (I typically do that) and "git init --bare reponame.git" on the remote, then simply push to that from your local
[03:03:37] <Gabin> Yeah, the latter is where my searching was taking me.
[03:03:51] <j416> e.g., git remote add origin user@server:/path/to/repo.git && git push origin master
[03:04:47] *** Joins: clf59 (~clf59@user/clf59)
[03:04:50] <j416> useful to know is that you would typically never _push_ into a non-bare repo.
[03:05:00] <Gabin> But I don't know what the first suggestion was to look like. `git clone <back/to/local>:~/.weechat .`
[03:05:01] <j416> bare means it has no work dir
[03:05:25] <j416> Gabin: just like any clone
[03:05:47] <j416> Gabin: remote would have to have a way to access your local machine obviously.
[03:05:57] <j416> often times this is tricky
[03:06:15] <Gabin> Ah, so perhaps the push to bare is the path of least resistance?
[03:06:21] <j416> I would say so yes
[03:06:30] <Gabin> Will try, thank you
[03:07:08] <j416> it's also similar to how github and friends work (create repo on github is equivalent to git init --bare reponame.git)
[03:07:57] <j416> (similar conceptually; of course github has other tricks to make it work at scale)

[03:16:58] <Gabin> So then I might do something like add remote origin with name .weechat_bare_repo, push to that, then on remote, clone .weechat_bare_repo into .weechat?
[03:17:07] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[03:17:56] <Gabin> Or is there an advisable way to shorten that to two repos instead of three? Or keep the three?
[03:18:34] <Gabin> I mean, assuming I don't add the birectional ssh method.
[03:19:34] <Gabin> It seems both methods keep a sort of symmetry, with respect to both working repos need to decide when to fetch or merge.
[03:19:53] <Gabin> Independently, that is.

[03:35:06] <bookworm> not really no
[03:35:35] <bookworm>  unless noted otherwise being on a branch implies the latest commit
[03:36:14] <Samian> oh
[03:36:22] <Samian> so what do I say?
[03:36:23] <Samian> master latest?
[03:36:25] <Samian> or just master?
[03:36:28] <Samian> master is vague though
[03:36:35] <bookworm> it's not
[03:36:45] <bookworm> mostly called main these days though
[03:37:05] <Gabin> Maybe "master branch"
[03:37:23] <bookworm> but for users of git, the code is in main or on the x branch makes perfect sense
[03:37:29] <Gabin> Github's wiki repos still force use of "master"
[03:37:51] <mackerman> The name of the branch doesn't matter.
[03:37:54] <mackerman> Saying a branch name implies the latest, perhaps after you fetch from me

[05:38:53] <j416> Gabin: assuming you have two machines you're trying to keep in sync; three repos makes a lot of sense, with the third being a bare repo on some kind of server
[05:39:38] <j416> Gabin: an alternative would be to set them up so that each is the remote of the other, and only fetch.
[05:40:47] <Gabin> I think I trust my personal computer a little bit more than the VPS, so I'm not sure I want to start thinking about allowing the VPS to ssh into my personal computer just yet.

[07:19:36] <_crazygirl> In spanish language "libera" (the name of this mIRC net) means to set free, liberate. Let me do it and respect my opinion, thank you.
[07:19:36] <_crazygirl> Wake up and save your life. You are facing a global genocide that many have already confirmed, it is through vaccines. Some are placebo but most carry poison. If you have already been vaccinated...
[07:19:36] <_crazygirl> whatever the brand or number of doses, learn about antidotes and remedies to save your life, otherwise you will die prematurely. Download Telegram and go to channels as GRABA TU HOSPITAL, FORO QUINTA COLUMNA, NOTICIAS RAFAPAL or EJERCITO REMANENTE. It is a plan of the WHO and Bill Gates, in collusion with the media.
[07:19:36] <_crazygirl> It is very difficult for you to believe me at once, because of the negative primacy induced by TV. VACCINES, both for the 2019 flu (death of the elderly) and all those of COVID carry POISON to kill us. don¥t answer to me please. Good Lucky

[15:28:31] <sandra> At work we have one submodule "backend" that's shared between two separate projects "client" and "server".
[15:28:31] <sandra> Most changes involve change to both one of the projects and to the shared "backend" submodule.
[15:28:31] <sandra> I'm working on something in a branch. A branch on both "backend" and "client".
[15:28:31] <sandra> What are some good practices for me to follow in this situation? Is there a good tutorial? I'm constantly messing things up and making mistakes. I have access to magit and to the normal command line git.
[15:28:31] <sandra> For example, I have a hard time keeping "backend" and "client" in sync, and I've sometimes rebased on top of our "main"/"trunk" branch, only to later find out that I needed to do more hacking/fixing on my own branch while the main branch also has moved on and everything is all confused.
[15:29:44] <Nomikos> sandra: what we do is keep a version.txt in the main (client) repo, which also contains the version of the shared lib repo. on checkout a post-checkout script runs that checks out the correct branch/release of the shared branch too
[15:30:27] <Nomikos> it takes some setting up but we have several projects depending on the shared thing. works well so far
[15:31:57] <sandra> Thank you, Nomikos. In Magit there is a "Subproject commit" hash that I don't really understand yet

[19:42:03] *** Joins: lemonade (~lemonade@user/lemonade)
[19:43:19] <cbreak> reverting applies inverse patches
[19:43:32] <lpapp> even if I try to drop the latest change, it does not work, I am getting a conflict.
[19:43:33] <cbreak> rebasing with dropping applies the patches of commits after those you drop
[19:43:35] <lpapp> Why would this happen?
[19:43:37] <cbreak> those are ... different things
[19:43:49] <lpapp> I did not ask for the differences.
[19:43:50] <lpapp> I do not think
[19:43:52] <lpapp> I know that :)
[19:43:59] <lpapp> I was asking why I cannot drop a change from the history locally
[19:44:03] <lpapp> without getting a conflict.
[19:44:07] <cbreak> you asked how it's possible to get conflicts
[19:44:32] <lpapp> let me refocus the discussion: why am I getting a conflict when I am trying to drop the last commit?
[19:44:37] <cbreak> presumably, because the commits afterwards need something
[19:44:44] <cbreak> something in the commits you want to drop
[19:44:51] <lpapp> I am trying to drop the last commit.
[19:44:54] <cbreak> how?
[19:44:58] <cbreak> git reset --hard HEAD~?
[19:45:05] <lpapp> git rebase -i HEAD~10 -> mark the last commit as drop

[19:45:57] <cbreak> you can try --keep-merges, but ... not sure how that will work
[19:46:04] <cbreak> might in this case.
[19:46:16] <cbreak> if you only want to drop the last one, do what I said above
[19:46:33] <cbreak> or only rebase HEAD~1 or HEAD~2
[19:46:37] <lpapp> no, I want to drop commits in the middle.
[19:46:50] <lpapp> dropping the last commit is just to get a simple dropping work

[19:48:00] <cbreak> reset to before the history you want to rewrite, then redo all the merges manually, and all the commits via cherry-picking
[19:48:08] <cbreak> it's annoying though.
[19:49:39] <lpapp> yes, it would be time-consuming and error-prone
[19:50:04] <lpapp> it is a shame that rebase does not handle a non-linear history nicely.

[23:09:11] <hydrian> I have a sub-project in SVN that is versioned by the parent project. Now, that I'm migrating to GIT, I want to move it to it's own project and have each parent project version be a branch.

[23:25:58] <AMPed> I'm working on a feature branch, but I have a change unrelated to my particular task that should go to master; is this a simple matter of "git branch master; git add/commit/push; git branch feature-branch"?

[23:29:05] <Albright> On my laptop, a pre-push hook script doesn't seem to be running. It's still working on my desktop, though. Might I have done something on the laptop to stop the hook from running?
