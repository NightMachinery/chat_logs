The point in that example is that _R_, the sigma-algebra of all Borel sets of reals, has many subcollections _A_ that generate the full _R_ as a sigma-algebra.

[19:43:55] <cadmio> if G' is the derived group of G' and G'x, Gy' two elements of G/G' then it results G'x ⋅ G' y = G ' xy = G'yxy^{−1}x^{−1}xy = G' yx = G'y ⋅ Gx
[19:44:06] <cadmio> I don't understand the equality in the middle
[19:44:41] <Z-module> I hope you meant  G'x and G'y  -- two right cosets of G'
[19:44:48] <riv> Do you know how G' is defined?
[19:45:35] <cadmio> G ' := ⟨xyx^{−1}y^{−1} | x,y ∈ G⟩
[19:46:12] <riv> yeah
[19:46:18] <riv> G' = [G,G] is another way to write it
[19:46:26] *** Quits: kish` (~sid742412@user/aqua) (Remote host closed the connection)

[19:48:13] <Z-module> yes, so in particular, G' contains all those commutator elements, so using the x, y you wrote earlier (for the two cosets), G' contains the element y^{−1}x^{−1}xy   (the commutator formed from the two elements y^{−1} and x^{−1}, in that order)
[19:51:40] <cadmio> so that's because [x,y] = [y,x]
[19:53:17] <riv> G' x G' y = { comm1 x comm2 y in G | comm1, comm2 in G' }
[19:53:35] <riv> suppose you wanted to write it in the form { comm3 something in G | comm3 in G' }
[19:53:41] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[19:53:42] <riv> how would you figure out how to do that?
[19:54:26] <riv> basically given x,y,comm1,comm2 as input, invent comm3 and something to solve: comm1 x comm2 y = comm3 something
[19:54:32] <Z-module> well, G' has all possible finite products of commutators, not just single commutators, rv, but your notation could jsut cover that too
[19:55:09] <riv> we know [x,y] y x = [x,y] x y. but we want x comm2 y, so how about [x comm2, y] y x comm2
[19:56:00] <riv> that = x comm2 y, so we can premultiply by comm1
[19:57:41] <riv> oh so that definition earlier is wrong?

[22:28:53] <laurus> I have heard the statement that similarity transforms on linear transformations are an equivalence relation. However, _what relation_ is an equivalence relation there? It seems like, for example, if "A ~ B" that means we have some S in GL_n(K) such that B = S A S^{-1}, but if we say "B ~ C" we have some T in GL_n(K) such that C = T B T^{-1} (looking at transitivity)... so what relation is are we talking about when we say "equivalence relation" here?

[22:31:10] <Vornicus> an equivalence relation is a relation (that is, a function X^2 -> bool) that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
[22:31:17] <laurus> Vornicus: Yes

[22:32:46] <laurus> My question still stands. I mean, the set of similarity transforms is "inner automorphisms" but that isn't just one equivalence relation, it's a set of them
[22:33:19] <Vornicus> I expect that each similarity transform provides an equivalence relation
[22:34:08] <laurus> Vornicus: Well, I don't think so, because of the example I just gave. To get "A ~ C" you would have to use the transform that multiplies ST and post multiplies (ST)^{-1}
[22:34:25] *** Quits: madage (~madage@user/madage) (Remote host closed the connection)

[22:37:50] <Vornicus> but my understanding of similarity transformations is that you can ... apply them as much as you want.
[22:37:54] <Vornicus> or as little
[22:38:07] <laurus> Vornicus: Well, it turns out that the set of similarity transformations forms a group
[22:38:42] <laurus> I could explain it but I don't want to take your time if you are not interested in the topic
[22:39:36] <Vornicus> Mmmh.  Okay, looking further into this, it looks like this can work in a few ways

[22:41:10] <laurus> Vornicus: so, we have Hom(X, X), the set of homomorphisms from a vector space X to itself. This is an algebra: it is closed under scalar multiplication, addition, and also "multiplication" (composition)
[22:42:03] <laurus> two elements a and b of a group G are conjugate if there is an element G such that b = g^{-1} a g
[22:42:26] <Vornicus> In particular, similarity transformations appear to form a normal subgroup (subalgebra?) of the group of all transformations
[22:42:33] <laurus> f: G -> G is an "inner automorphism" of a group G iff f is an automorphism and there exists a y in G such that f(x) = y^{-1} x y

[22:45:16] <laurus> I'm familiar with the concept that an equivalence relation breaks a set into partitions
[22:45:17] <isekaijin> laurus: Conjugation induces an equivalence relation on the set of subgroups of G. But your original situation with matrix similarity is not like this. You are not defining an equivalence relation on the set of subgroups of GL_n(K), but rather on GL_n(K) itself (or Mat_{nxn}(K), even).
[22:46:21] <laurus> isekaijin: Oh okay.

[22:46:34] <laurus> I wonder what that equivalence relation itself is
[22:47:14] <Vornicus> The equivalence relation is simply "these items land in the same equivalence class when doing the quotient"
[22:48:37] <laurus> Vornicus: well, wait a minute, don't you have to know what the equivalence relation is in order to say what the quotient set is?
[22:48:49] <Vornicus> We've defined it
[22:49:54] <isekaijin> laurus: The equivalence relation is literally that two matrices are similar if... the condition that you already know.
[22:49:55] <laurus> Vornicus: is it something like, "A is similar to B" iff there exists some S in GL_n(K) such that A = SBS^{-1}?
[22:50:16] <Vornicus> it is, simply put, --that
[22:50:16] <greenbagels> yes
[22:50:33] <laurus> Okay, great, thank you, thanks also isekaijin
[22:50:35] <laurus> and greenbagels
[22:50:35] <laurus> :)
[22:51:29] <greenbagels> laurus: if you want to be pedantic, the relation is a subset of X x X
[22:51:36] <greenbagels> made up of all pairs that are "related"
[22:51:50] <greenbagels> i.e. (A,B) means A and B are "related" via a similarity transform
[22:51:52] <laurus> greenbagels: I was trying to start that way, but I thought it would be a subset of Hom(X, X) x Hom(X, X)
[22:52:03] <laurus> Since A and B are members of Hom(X, X)
[22:52:15] <greenbagels> X, Hom(X, X), whatever it is
[22:52:23] <laurus> Where Hom(X, X) is the set of all "stucture preserving maps" from X to itself

[23:26:59] <mycroftiv> right at the bottom of p.2 going into p.3 of that file, it defines a K-cover of the category of filters and i dont understand all the indices and positioning of symbols in the notation
[23:28:32] <isekaijin> What good is doing this fancy schmancy stuff without doing some bona fide concrete geometry first?
[23:30:50] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: because the reason i have spent hours a day for years trying to study mathematics is to understand large cardinals in set theory and how to make computers understand them and that led to sheaf topos constructions like this in type theory
[23:32:11] <mycroftiv> i have become very interested in the spatial and geometric meaning of homological ideas because i have also studied music theory as a major topic in life, and a lot of physics as well, but understanding the logic of ultrafilters is what those topics led toward for me

[23:38:19] <mycroftiv> ive spent a lot of the past couple months studying topology especially 4-manifolds and things like the disc embedding theorem
[23:38:21] <isekaijin> It's useless because axioms are just a means to convey a geometric idea. In a different context, you might want to pick a different set of axioms, possibly not even logically equivalent to the original ones.
[23:39:59] <mycroftiv> maybe the geometric consequences of logic gate wiring in a boolean switching algebra is the geometry im studying then, which corresponds to all these algebraic lattice structures in set theory
[23:40:27] <mycroftiv> the infinite binary branching tree and the binary hypercube and n-simplexes are very geometrical
[23:41:45] <mycroftiv> so given something like the geometrical understanding of flipping bits in a binary sequence as travelling a gray code path along the vertexes of a binary hypercube encoded by the binary bits, what more geometry do you need?
[23:42:28] <mycroftiv> i can explain how an ultrafilter on N corresponds to progressive dissection of infinite dimensional simplexes and how there is a snowflake-crystal like infinitesimally thing 'trace' of the ultrafilter inside
[23:42:35] <bildramer> consider a bunch of vectors close to the surface of an n-dimensional ball, plus the zero vector. I want something like a "dissimilarity metric", such that v and -v are the closest possible match, v and nearby vectors are barely a match, v and orthogonal vectors can't be too much of a match, but with the additional feature that any vector and 0 are close matches too

[23:49:45] <mycroftiv> my point was, there are lots of branches of mathematics with geometric/spatial meaning and applicability, why is some particular theorem about manifolds suddenly a criteria for determining what math is worth studying?
[23:51:14] <mycroftiv> the mathematics of how you create different tuning systems and scales based on number theory of harmonic ratios is fascinating, but i dont say that all math has to have some music-theoretical application to be useful

[23:52:28] <mycroftiv> is it a coincidence that we seem to inhabit the exact topological manifold dimensionality with this unique dichotomy between the topological and smooth categories?
[23:52:47] <mycroftiv> thats what got me interested in Casson handles and freedman disc theorem
[23:53:45] <mycroftiv> the idea that there are unique possibilities in 4manifolds (exotic R4) where these crazy fractal handles weave space together oddly, and that might be physically true of our universe
