[18:37:14] <Dus10> anyone in the US that does IaC/GitOps?
[18:37:44] <Dus10> stacks that I am most interested in are Packer, Terraform, Ansible, OPA, GitHub
[18:38:04] <Dus10> I am looking to see if anyone is interested in a contract-to-hire role at a consulting company
[18:38:17] <Dus10> it would need to be a senior person
[18:40:35] <rawtaz> Dus10: you got all of the requirements wrong
[18:43:35] <rawtaz> ;)
[18:43:43] <Dus10> mkay
[18:44:09] <Dus10> my junior people are getting trained up and leaving
[18:44:41] <Dus10> I have been trying to get those getting through our program to take on projects and mentor the newest folks...
[18:44:45] <Dus10> but they aren't hanging around that long
[18:45:21] <Dus10> 6-8 months after they graduate
[18:45:37] <Dus10> so, I have to see what I can convince leadership to do about that
[18:45:50] <rawtaz> Dus10: are you in the US?
[18:46:34] <rawtaz> i thought you werent
[18:46:46] <Dus10> yeah, I am in the US
[18:47:05] <Dus10> I hang out with the Teutons, though
[18:47:12] <Dus10> so, that confuses a lot of folks

[19:21:42] <kubblai> all the youngsters new to devops at my last place left for money
[19:22:16] <kubblai> i dunno but once a company has you on the payroll they seems to want to make up silly rules like youn can get a max 5% payrise
[19:22:41] <kubblai> ofc if another company is gonna double your salary you leave
[19:25:55] <rawtaz> thats quite a good point, but it doesnt take into account the time and money the company spent teaching these fsckers what they didnt know and would take years to figure out themselves (not to mention they probably wouldnt figure it out themselves as they wouldnt have the real-world problems and infra to do it on)
[19:28:15] <kubblai> there is no loyalty tho, ppl know that if they died the company wouldnt care a jot and simply replace them
[19:28:52] <rawtaz> well thats not really a fair comparison - if the employee died, what else can the company do but to replace them? :P
[19:30:09] <kubblai> true but my point is workers know that companies see them as replaceable so not workers see companies as replaceable too :)
[19:30:21] <kubblai> not = now
[19:31:30] <kubblai> devops in particular atm is crazy for recruitment. workers really have the power right now
[19:34:27] <rawtaz> indeed (on the last line above)

[20:54:16] <Dus10> yeah, I was able to get my best minion retained, but it was at the cost of him going to another team
[20:54:26] <Dus10> but he deserved to get bumped up
[20:54:57] <Dus10> I've been at my company for 8 years now... no way I would have been here this long if it wasn't a good place to work... good, not perfect
[20:55:17] <Dus10> although now, I am going to need a market adjustment or I could start looking
[20:55:47] <Dus10> I think I could easily get $30k than I make right now, on my base salary
[20:56:07] <Dus10> but, I would have to be able to get a good bonus, too
[20:56:35] <Dus10> my target annual bonus is $22.5k and this year I will have $36k in actual bonus
