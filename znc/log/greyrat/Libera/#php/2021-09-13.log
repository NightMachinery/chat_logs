[10:57:27] <TinoDidriksen> No, use a virtual machine or WSL or Docker.
[10:57:38] <biberu> tester12: i don't think there are many here that use wamp, even if you're developing on windows it's common to release to linux and then it's convenient to use something that closer resembles that environment
[10:57:53] <TinoDidriksen> Windows is simply not supported.
[10:59:38] <biberu> ^ that doesn't necessarily mean your choice of desktop
[11:00:36] <tester12> TinoDidriksen biberu Is it easier than Wamp
[11:00:43] <tester12> ??
[11:00:53] <tester12> OR XAMPP
[11:01:01] <biberu> tester12: easier for what?
[11:01:01] <TinoDidriksen> In the short run, no. In the long run, oh very much yes.
[11:01:25] <TinoDidriksen> Getting a proper environment set up will be worth it in the medium to long run. But it'll be some pain for a day.
[11:01:54] <biberu> should be pretty easy to get docker going with a php image from the hub, not sure if that would be harder than setting up wamp if you're equally new to both
[11:02:02] <tester12> biberu to use a localhost for test php project(php,mysql and apache)
[11:02:19] <TinoDidriksen> Docker and WSL are still localhost.
[11:02:27] <biberu> tester12: yeah, sure, any of the options TinoDidriksen listed are still local
[11:02:35] <tester12> virtual host on win
[11:03:00] <TinoDidriksen> A VM can be localhost or not, depending on what you need to test. Usually localhost.
[11:03:16] <biberu> (containers too)
[11:04:22] <biberu> tester12: are you familiar with linux?
[11:04:36] <tester12> biberu a little
[11:05:06] <biberu> if you decide to try out any of the options above that might help :)
[11:05:32] <biberu> this project you want to run, is it for learning, work?
[11:06:20] <tester12> its for work
[11:06:40] <biberu> what os are you releasing to?
[11:06:42] <tester12> but I use wamp for many years
[11:07:10] <Naktibalda> and you still have questions :)

[11:08:59] <biberu> what is the question anyway?
[11:09:48] <tester12> biberu after test on my laptop release it on a linux host I bought and has cpanel
[11:10:28] <TinoDidriksen> Then you should also develop on Linux.
[11:10:55] <TinoDidriksen> Your dev host should match your production host.
[11:11:06] <tester12> biberu In wamp a few days I cant use localhost instead 127.0.0.1 in address bar to get access to my php project
[11:11:15] <tester12> on wamp 3.2.3.0
[11:12:02] <tester12> and main page of wamp with localhost doesnt go up
[11:12:56] <biberu> that's pretty vague and i don't know anything about wamp, but i guess i'd start with checking that apache is up etc
[11:13:31] <tester12> thanks
[11:13:55] <biberu> still, if you're deploying to linux consider running your dev environment on that too (using any of the tools tino mentioned), you can still use windows as your host / desktop
[11:14:01] <tester12> good luck
[11:14:40] <biberu> aren't you running into issues with e.g. case sensitivity in paths?
[11:16:19] <tester12> no

[17:36:20] <g0z> I have a php cli question, I'm running a simple bash loop over a set of arguments in a file, this part definitely works but the php just tries to process the first item in the list over and over and only after I press "enter" so I think I'm missing something in how to use php cli properly with -B -F -E switches. My non-working command line follows.
[17:36:26] <g0z> for i in $(cat ~/someUN); do php -B "\$_REQUEST = array('searchstring' => '${i}');" -F woo-libcurl-test.php ; done
[17:37:44] <g0z> I tried adding an -E arg with exit or die but it doesn't actually exit and continue to the next loop interation, so there's something I do not understand here

[17:51:27] <__adrian> you're not sending anything into input
[17:51:28] <sebbu> also, beware of line endings and spaces

[17:58:48] <g0z> it doesn't 1. execute until I press 'enter' 2. iterate to next item in the bash loop after it executes. in fact pressing enter multiple times it just repeats the same action
[17:59:50] <g0z> I think -F just doesn't work how I expect it to
[18:00:33] <g0z> and before suggesting using -f, that is incompatible with -B as far as i can tell
[18:07:22] <sebbu> g0z, the correct syntax would more be like php -F woo-libcurl-test.php < ~/someUN

[22:12:05] <Rockwood> biberu, o/
[22:12:19] <lembron> and not much an x-y i believe when i clearly state to need define() --- some alien-method be `echo "<?php define('mo','no');" > /tmp/setter.php && php -d auto_prepend_file=/tmp/setter.php -f script.php` but that seems fugly...
[22:12:20] <biberu> night Rockwood o/
[22:12:30] <Rockwood> biberu, is night there too?
[22:12:40] <biberu> nah, evening
[22:12:53] <Rockwood> yeah here 23:12
[22:13:06] <biberu> lembron: that still leaves me full of questions :)
[22:13:15] <grawity> frankly that's literally the definition of "x-y problem"
[22:13:40] <grawity> (in which I use 'literally' non-literally)
[22:13:53] <biberu> that's literally what it means now
[22:14:11] <grawity> but you could probably overwrite SCRIPT_FILENAME and stuff
[22:14:35] <grawity> hmm wait a moment
[22:14:55] <grawity> ah no scratch that
[22:15:10] <Sammitch> kinda smells like your script should read an environment variable rather than trying to shoehorn in a constant from the outside.
[22:15:55] <lembron> im just kinda expecting some "sure there is a ini way: -d predefined_define_mo='me'"
[22:16:10] <Sammitch> but instead of tripling-down on "no I need to do Y and you're all just being unhelpful" you could elaborate on your use case a bit more.
[22:16:18] <grawity> "I need to pass some data to a script, and i decided that the way to do it is by passing a const by injecting define()"
[22:17:44] <lembron> strike the "i decided that" from that, then thats about right
[22:21:12] <biberu> lembron: so what's the use case? can you use e.g. command line parameters? config file? environment vars? why / why not?
[22:22:25] <lembron> it aint my code
[22:24:16] <biberu> yet here you are asking the question
[22:24:25] <biberu> or rather, not asking it
[22:24:55] <biberu> anyway, got other things to do, good luck

[22:32:02] <sumthing1980> hello Im trying to write something very simple Im a bit rusty
[22:32:08] <sumthing1980> it is a programming question
[22:32:15] <sumthing1980> trying to brute force my own md5
[22:32:41] <sumthing1980> it is about permutation an array where each number goes from 0 to 26
[22:32:48] <sumthing1980> in php
[22:33:09] <lembron> __adrian that "no" is all ive been looking for - paired with "-B" not beeing useable.... i guess echo>mktmp && auto_prepend_file it is :|
[22:33:20] <sumthing1980> permutation functions in php give the entire array though
[22:33:51] <sumthing1980> I just want to be able to count in an array from 0 0 0 0 0 to 26 26 26 26 26
[22:33:52] <__adrian> lembron: strongly suspect that's a very non-ideal "solution."
[22:33:58] <sumthing1980> for example
[22:34:20] <__adrian> but without detail, can't suggest anything better.
[22:34:56] <__adrian> sumthing1980: "permutation functions"?
[22:35:01] <__adrian> what are you using?
[22:35:11] <lembron> absolutely is, but gonna do it till upstream adds env-vars as option :/
[22:35:35] <__adrian> lembron: there's this thing called a "pull request" ...  :)
[22:36:15] <__adrian> but even considering that, auto_prepend_file is really non-ideal.
[22:37:01] <sumthing1980> not using anything yet writing my own

[22:38:24] <lembron> if only ;-)
[22:39:20] <sumthing1980> there were a few but they return an entire set of combinations, I dont want that I just want an array to count from say 0 0 0 to 26 26 26

[22:40:18] <sumthing1980> I have not been able to find anything native that is of interest
[22:40:21] <sumthing1980> there is a shuffle
[22:40:32] <Sammitch> "entire sets" like that become larger than available memory very quickly
[22:40:33] <sumthing1980> that comes up in search but does not do what I want remotely
[22:40:44] <sumthing1980> yes so Im not interested in the entire set
[22:40:52] <sumthing1980> just something that can count past 9

[22:59:48] <__adrian> https://php.net/generator
[22:59:51] <__adrian> DON'T eval.
[23:01:01] <__adrian> a generator allows you to produce the results one at a time, instead of all upfront and then returning (which was your main concern/ask)
[23:01:55] <__adrian> "I dont suppose there is a way to dynamically alter the for count?"  the count is already dynamic
[23:02:26] <__adrian> oh, nvm; you were talking about Sammitch's example (not the SO example)
[23:03:07] <__adrian> but then, why would you need to change the count? you need to loop once for each item, which is what foreach does
