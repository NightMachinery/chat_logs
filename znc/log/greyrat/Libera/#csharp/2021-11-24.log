[02:38:07] <MaNa2k> so how the fuck do you add an sln+new proejct to an existing github repo
[02:38:13] <MaNa2k> i have connected to the repo from vs22
[02:38:20] <MaNa2k> but cant figure out how to add the sln
[02:38:23] <MaNa2k> and new project
[02:40:09] <MaNa2k> i know ive done this in vs19 but cant figure out in vs22
[02:40:55] <lz_> git add ?
[02:41:55] <MaNa2k> was wondering how with the ui
[02:44:16] <MaNa2k> in vs22
[02:45:19] <MaNa2k> ah i dont have git yet lol
[02:45:26] <MaNa2k> im on a new pc
[02:46:52] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: well save a sln file into the repository directory however you're going to do that, then open vs and use the team explorer to commit it
[02:48:05] <MaNa2k> Suchiman, yes but i have no idea whats suppose to be inside the sln
[02:48:17] <MaNa2k> it has some mumbo jumbo auto generated code
[02:49:39] <MaNa2k> so i get this error, "the selected file is not a .... solution file"
[02:49:46] <MaNa2k> wheni create a new file with .sln
[02:50:31] <MaNa2k> maybe i should have first created the solution\project, then pushed to a git repo
[02:50:58] <Arokh> Is dllmap still the way to go to reference (pinvoke) different native files per architecture?
[02:51:04] <MaNa2k> what i did now is first create the git repo, then connect to this repo, then trying to add a new sln
[02:51:50] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: well either create a new project + solution with VS in the repository or open a csproj in VS and then click on save all, that will auto generate a sln file for the csproj and prompt you for a save path
[02:52:46] <MaNa2k> mhm, i think ill just create a new project + solution, then connect and push it to the repo
[02:52:56] <MaNa2k> seems like an easier way
[02:58:42] <MaNa2k> got it working now

[09:29:19] <tsujp> note that I've overloaded the `data` field -- is that the property way to say "data field could be type X or type Y"
[09:29:20] <ki9a> that doesn't compile

And at the line of defining the DbSet, I get the error message: Inconsistent accessibility: property type 'DbSet...' is less accessible than property.
[12:21:45] <Nasp> Make it all public
[12:22:09] <littlebit> this is my code: https://dpaste.org/foFS
[12:22:20] <littlebit> and the error is at 'Properties'
[12:22:57] <littlebit> what am I missing
[12:23:00] <littlebit> ?
[12:23:03] <biberu> littlebit: is your Property type internal?
[12:23:27] <littlebit> biberu: check the dpaste link, all set to public
[12:23:38] <biberu> Property isn't in your paste
[12:24:23] <littlebit> https://dpaste.org/foFS
[12:24:50] <biberu> yes, Property isn't defined there
[12:25:30] <littlebit> @line 16?
[12:25:34] <biberu> you probably have a class Property somewhere, what does it look like?
[12:25:49] <littlebit> it is in the same namespace
[12:25:57] <biberu> show it
[12:26:34] <biberu> line 16 is declaring a property called Properties of the type DbSet<Property>, Property (capital P) is missing
[12:27:10] <littlebit> https://dpaste.org/pCoD
[12:27:33] <biberu> that class is internal, so you can't use it in a public interface

[12:28:14] <littlebit> even if I explicitly add using Project.Models.Property?
[12:28:51] <littlebit> but the error is on Properties not Property
[12:29:09] <biberu> that's just fully qualifying the name, it doesn't affect Property's visibility, and since you didn't declare what it should be it's defaulting to internal
[12:31:01] <biberu> if you make Property (the class) public the error should go away, but i'd ask myself if i really want things outside of the project to be able to work directly with those types, perhaps they should just be internal, it depends

[12:58:33] <Nasp> And when they are started after 5 minutes i have no idea what i was actually working on
[12:58:36] <Nasp> Or after 1 minute of compile
[12:58:46] <Inge> you definitely need a threadripper

[12:59:34] <Nasp> For some reason we keep adding more and more global critacal services you need to run locally for anything to work
[12:59:51] <Nasp> I think we are now on our 8th permission systems, and they are just all slapped on top of each other, so they all require each other

[13:05:39] <Inge> MaNa2k: I've been developing in VS on windows as a VM on top of Linux on Threadripper since 2019
[13:06:21] <MaNa2k> mhm
[13:06:24] <MaNa2k> cool
[13:06:52] <Inge> The issue HAS been that *nested* virtualization didn't work on AMD cpu's with win10 until fairly recent releases
[13:07:03] <MaNa2k> Inge, i think ms should just release a fucking linux version of visual studio

[13:14:33] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  They have virtualization
[13:14:47] <Tazy> Well I have a list of objects, and I want to take each object, and deseralize it, it was using JObject.ToObject
[13:14:50] <MaNa2k> so developement on amd is good ?
[13:14:51] <ki9a> If so, for what purpose, since you can't really store that, the pointers are not stable.

[13:15:03] <Tazy> Otherwise I need to just let this http client expose a stream so I can deserialize properly
[13:15:17] <ki9a> so really this is about object -> json and back?
[13:15:19] <MaNa2k> i think someone once mentioned here on this channel that it wasnt a good idea to do developement with amd
[13:15:31] <MaNa2k> i wonder if its was with android developement
[13:15:32] <MaNa2k> maybe
[13:15:42] <MaNa2k> due to some virtualization issues
[13:15:55] <Tazy> ki9a, more like, it was json, deserialized to object, now I need to take that object to a specific poco
[13:16:30] <ki9a> I don't understand why ToObject/FromObject doesn't work then?
[13:16:48] <MaNa2k> Tazy, are you trying to make a copy of your object?
[13:16:52] <Tazy> ki9a, cause I am no longer using Newtonsoft linq, changing to System.Text.Json
[13:17:13] <ki9a> ah now w're gettng somewhere. I didn't see you say that
[13:17:46] <ki9a> can't you use JsonSerializer.Serialize() / Deserialize?
[13:17:55] <MaNa2k> Tazy, why chaning?
[13:18:04] <Tazy> MaNa2k, speed issues :/
[13:18:07] <MaNa2k> hmm
[13:18:13] <MaNa2k> i see,
[13:18:17] <Tazy> ki9a, because the deserialize wants a span, string, or stream
[13:18:34] <Tazy> I have neither, and don't want to ToString this object, and incure that cost
[13:18:34] <MaNa2k> but there are other json libs out there that are faster then microsofts
[13:19:01] <ki9a> MaNa2k: system.text.json is pretty fast.
[13:19:10] <Tazy> Yeah but maintainability
[13:19:16] <ki9a> Tazy: if you already have the obejct, why would you deserialize it again?
[13:19:36] <MaNa2k> ki9a, why is eveyone using newtonsoft then ?
[13:19:44] <ki9a> because it was there first.
[13:19:48] <MaNa2k> hmm
[13:19:55] <ki9a> asp.net core uses system.text.json by default sinec v5 though
[13:20:03] <Tazy> ki9a, cause I have `object` I need lets say CalculateExcessesResult (POCO)
[13:20:18] <ki9a> how did you get "object" ?
[13:20:19] <Tazy> MaNa2k, also still more feature rich
[13:20:35] <ki9a> not feature rich per se. but speed comes at a cost.
[13:20:44] <MaNa2k> according to this comparison, its missing some features https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-migrate-from-newtonsoft-how-to?pivots=dotnet-6-0
[13:21:00] <ki9a> yes.
[13:21:05] <MaNa2k> but i bet 90% are probaly not using all of then anyhow
[13:21:06] <ki9a> it's not perfect. But it works very well
[13:21:20] <MaNa2k> cool, maybe ill try it out on my next project
[13:21:38] <Tazy> ki9a, okay let me explain why its like this, so there is a POCO that has type info and stuff, so a bunch of different POCO's are serialized to the server, and it responds. So I don't have a single object coming back. So I need to loop over the objects and convert them to the types, this is why I have a list of objects
[13:21:48] <Tazy> Perviously it was a list of JObjects that came back
[13:22:58] <ki9a> ah.
[13:23:13] <ki9a> can't you use the JsonObject or whatever system.text.json calls it?
[13:23:17] <ki9a> That or just use JObjectanyway.
[13:23:38] <Tazy> System.Text I think just uses object
[13:23:49] <ki9a> no
[13:23:50] <Tazy> but I still need to take said object , back to the POCO
[13:24:04] <bomb> LOCO
[13:24:05] <ki9a> if it's object it's probably a dynamically wrapped one
[13:24:11] <ki9a> in alcopoco
[13:24:12] <Tazy> JsonDocument I think
[13:25:14] <Tazy> ah but System.Text.Json is not dealing with this ElapseMilliseconds that is a long
[13:25:23] <Nasp> 30 minutes to start all docker services, damn
[13:26:01] <bomb> microservices fashion is out of control
[13:27:15] <Nasp> hmm nope all services werent ready yet

[14:02:30] <canton7> Tazy, I still maintain that you'd be better off sticking with json.net, but optimizing how you use it
[14:03:11] <Nasp> Get it to work, then optimize it
[14:03:21] <Nasp> I think it's an effort from both the consumer and producer
[14:03:30] <Nasp> since 20mb+ payloads will always be slow
[14:03:39] <Tazy> canton7, json.net, or System.Text.Json ?
[14:03:44] <canton7> Tazy, json.net
[14:04:01] <Tazy> But .Net5 replaces that with System.Text.Json does it not ?
[14:04:08] <Tazy> Also why json.net over newtonsoft
[14:04:18] <canton7> .NET 5 introduces its *own* json serializer. It doesn't replace json.net
[14:04:22] <canton7> json.net *is* newtonsoft.json
[14:04:23] <Tazy> oh
[14:04:27] <bomb> yeah canton7 why even json.net over newtonsoft?
[14:04:57] <Tazy> well at this point, I need to see the cost of doing an object.ToString, vs streams

[14:06:13] <Tazy> I have it working, but I am taking the outputs, and having to call .ToString on them, to deserialize to the POCO
[14:06:37] <canton7> I've no idea what you're talking about. "Stupid multiple execution method"? "The outputs"?

[14:31:59] <canton7> Tazy, but either way -- I'm going to repeat what I said multiple times yesterday. The speed of (de)serialization DOES NOT MATTER so long as it's faster than you can upload/download the serialized content, and you're doing the (de)serialization in parallel with the upload/download
[14:32:36] * Tazy goes to a corner to mope
[14:32:37] <canton7> If you're downloading and deserializing in parallel, it doesn't matter how slow the deserializing bit is, so long as it's the same speed as or faster than the downloading bit

[14:37:06] <Tazy> canton7, I mean there is no otherway in core3.1 than the ToString hack for this method currently
[14:37:56] <canton7> Right, so you benchmark it and show that your "we can implement the converts we need" has slowed things down by X%, and is that OK?

[15:22:10] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Ahh so nothing fancy
[15:22:14] <MatthiasVance> nope
[15:22:16] <Nasp> I kinda want a new one, since i dont like the sounds on mine
[15:22:18] <MatthiasVance> I am just learning
[15:22:25] <Nasp> They piano sounds are alright, but they dont have like reverb / resonance
[15:22:52] <MatthiasVance> Ah right yeah
[15:22:56] <Nasp> Not quite sure what the correct word for it is, but normally the different keys harmonize with eachother
[15:23:07] <Nasp> And with the wood and so on, mine just sounds a lot like individual sounds being played
[15:23:07] <bomb> buy FX pedals, then
[15:23:12] <Nasp> And it kinda ruins it a bit for me
[15:23:22] <bomb> resonation
[15:23:32] <bomb> yours don't do that?
[15:23:35] <Nasp> yeah might be resonance
[15:23:44] <Nasp> bomb:  Not really
[15:24:25] <bomb> yeah that makes a huge difference
[15:24:39] <Nasp> It might be called sympathetic resonance
[15:24:41] <Nasp> So yeah resonance
[15:24:46] <Nasp> But yeah it's missing and it sounds a bit dull
[15:24:47] <bomb> something like that
[15:24:56] <bomb> without that it sounds like MIDI piano from 90s
[15:25:02] <Nasp> Like also in a normal piano you can hear the resonance of the wood itself
[15:25:07] <Nasp> It doesn't sound exactly MIDI
[15:25:14] <Nasp> But it doesn't sound like a good piano either

[15:35:09] <bomb> https://8dio.com/instrument/1928-scoring-piano/
[15:35:36] <bomb> that was a paid sample library for Kontakt initially, they're giving it away to promote their Soundpaint software
[15:35:40] <Babbage> thas a big sampleset :D
[15:36:09] <Nasp> A single piano sound is big?
[15:36:13] <Nasp> Well it's kinda a nice idea
[15:36:20] <bomb> crazy isn't it. 2MB sample chip was considered HUGE in digital pianos back in 80s/90s
[15:36:43] <Nasp> That soundpay sound awesome

[15:37:24] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yes and mine seems to do that as well
[15:37:37] <Nasp> I kinda need a manual thermometer again to check if they are doing it correctly
[15:37:47] <MatthiasVance> Well this one thinks it's 23.9

[15:42:15] <Nasp> Ohh they only have two piano sounds
[15:42:21] <Nasp> But still not bad with one for free
[15:42:30] <Nasp> bomb:  It's been black friday this entire month
[15:42:47] <Nasp> Is midi still a pain or does it work more plug n play then before
[15:42:50] <Babbage> last piano i used i ended up using 2 different ones layered on top each other with a full tweaks to get a decent soundscape with them
[15:43:03] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Tado sensors ?
[15:43:16] <Nasp> I haven't used midi since you had to use one of thse cables https://d1aeri3ty3izns.cloudfront.net/media/52/528092/600/preview.jpg
[15:43:18] <Nasp> And it was pain
[15:43:28] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  No just some zigbee sensors
[15:43:43] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Haha that is still the case with my Casio
[15:43:47] <Babbage> hah ive some of those cables to the left of me
[15:44:03] <MatthiasVance> Same :D They convert to USB later on but still..
[15:44:05] <Nasp> bomb:  Btw what do they mean with analog style sampling
[15:44:12] <Nasp> Like don't they need to apply some digital effects to it as well
[15:44:21] <bomb> Nasp I don't understand why you want multiple piano sounds. these packs are deeply sampled with multi mic, so they should be quite flexible
[15:44:38] <bomb> also built-in FX and such
[15:44:40] <Babbage> different pianos can sound really different
[15:45:17] <bomb> XLN also has only two. one grand piano, one upright
[15:45:21] <bomb> e-Instruments has several

[15:54:02] <Nasp> But what i mean with digital is this can't just be analogue sampling only can it?
[15:55:09] <bomb> Nasp I think I know what you mean. some companies sample instruments using analog gear to sound "warm". I don't know if 1928 piano is sampled that way
[15:55:21] <MaNa2k> can you install win11 on a pc with tpm 1.2v ?
[15:56:19] <Babbage> bomb; guiitar sounds ok to me
[15:56:44] <bomb> but they likely used great microphones and mixing board, etc. so that wouldn't be an issue
[15:57:00] <bomb> Babbage yeah, workable in a busy mix, I hope
[15:57:09] <Nasp> But the resonance isn't that a digital effect?
[15:57:23] <Nasp> Also how can theyt be so much better at this than Yamaha
[15:57:33] <Nasp> Or maybe i didn't spend enough on this
[15:58:53] <Nasp> I wonder if i can load ssome of this onto the actual piano
[15:59:01] <Nasp> Since i've seen some put stuff in usb port on youtube
[15:59:05] <bomb> I don't exactly know how they achieve sympathetic resonance in sampling
[15:59:42] <Nasp> That was kinda my point
[15:59:50] <Nasp> Unless they've sampled all keys in all combinations together :D
[15:59:59] <bomb> maybe they use IR sampling
[16:00:13] <Nasp> I've actually considered i wanted to make a sample game to prove how to make good audio
[16:00:35] <bomb> sample game?
[16:00:39] <bomb> what's that
[16:00:47] <Nasp> Example game
[16:01:00] <bomb> you'd just use OpenAL
[16:01:38] <bomb> some game engines come with audio FX, all grabbed from a public domain DSP library

[16:21:54] <Rudde> So I have this .NET Api, and there is this one endpoint I really don't want the code to stop execution if the client closes the connection I would prefer the code to run finish insted
[16:21:58] <Rudde> is that possible?
[16:22:52] <MaNa2k> Rudde, yes, make it async
[16:23:36] <MaNa2k> and return a 200 ok immidiatly after you get a request, and handle the processing in a seperate thread
[16:23:51] <Nasp> It doens't stop if they reminate by defaul
[16:23:57] <interop_madness> ackchyually, 202 Accepted
[16:23:58] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  I wouldn't do that
[16:24:06] <Nasp> If you want it processes async i would throw it on a queue
[16:24:26] <MaNa2k> hmm, yea queue is better, but i dont think his at that level maybe
[16:24:55] <Nasp> That may be, but he will run into more issues by processing it after
[16:24:59] <Nasp> Since that isn't doable
[16:25:05] <MaNa2k> btw, im basically doing that with a webhook which stops workign if it dosnt get a 200 in timly fashion
[16:25:07] <Nasp> Just process the request normally should work
[16:25:26] <Nasp> You have a webhook that returns accepted?
[16:25:34] <MaNa2k> me?
[16:25:35] <MaNa2k> no
[16:25:35] <Nasp> Immediatly
[16:25:36] <Nasp> Yeah
[16:26:24] <MaNa2k> its an external webhoook made by someone, the timespan in which it wants a 200ok is to little
[16:26:28] <MaNa2k> and we cant control it
[16:26:46] <MaNa2k> so if it dosnt get 200 fast enough, it gets disabled
[16:26:57] <MaNa2k> for future posts
[16:27:35] <MaNa2k> so we solved this issue by returning 200 immidiately, and process the message in a different thread (async).
[16:27:44] <MaNa2k> but thats not what we would do today though
[16:27:54] <MaNa2k> we would only used service bus or storage queue
[16:28:42] <MaNa2k> its an old project though which we have been patching for many years.
[16:28:49] <Nasp> yeah use a boss
[16:29:17] <MaNa2k> we have also recently implemented concurrency control to avoid dupe pkg
[16:29:22] <interop_madness> my solution would be validate request -> if valid, queue task on a class derived from TaskScheduler and return 202 Accepted immediately
[16:29:37] <Nasp> bus.Publish, done
[16:29:37] <MaNa2k> ah
[16:29:45] <MaNa2k> so 202 is for that purpose

[17:50:41] <MaNa2k> jmer, mhm. i though the whole url was called endpoint
[17:50:43] <jmer> but apart from endpoint or path as MatthiasVance  I would just call them part of an URI
[17:50:58] <jmer> MaNa2k: well... They're part of an URL/URI

[17:52:42] <Nasp> Or everything before the path
[17:52:50] <Nasp> So it could be moved to another route
[17:52:55] <Nasp> But if i'ts part of the same api i wouldn't split it
[17:53:10] <jmer> Not sure I would feel comfortable making routes configurable in a file
[17:53:19] <jmer> I think I would much rather prefer to deploy a new.
[17:53:23] <jmer> So you can test if you broke something
[17:53:26] <MaNa2k> jmer, dont know, maybe that i wouldnt have to type all the endpoints in the config
[17:53:31] <jmer> the other approach will just make it easy to "fix" things in production
[17:54:45] <Nasp> jmer:  No urls or do you mean separate for each endpoint?
[17:54:53] <Nasp> Not surei  get the one for each endpoint unless you like extra work with no gain

[17:56:44] <Nasp> Yeah
[17:56:54] <Nasp> But why only that part
[17:57:03] <jmer> I dunno man
[17:57:10] <jmer> Usually I don't write my code to depend on a specific domain
[17:57:15] <jmer> so the domain is implicitly configurable
[17:57:26] <Nasp> i have this part in config "SomeApi": { "Url": "https://foo.com/blah" }
[17:58:09] <jmer> If you really need to have that part in your code I would make that configurable (so you can change to another domain or webserver without having to recompile code specifically for that host)
[17:58:21] <Tazy> So this is what it looks like comparing with a sample of our payloads https://imgur.com/a/g5GjNPw

[18:01:41] <Nasp> Now we are back up at 140 and 20+ projects incoming
[18:01:57] <Nasp> I think that is wrong
[18:02:01] <Nasp> You need to have a setup method
[18:02:05] <Nasp> And mark that

[18:03:46] <jmer> Nasp: yeah... there are many .sln files but this is the one that SonarCube is run against...
[18:03:54] <jmer> So it supposedly has "everything"
[18:04:00] <Nasp> public void Newtonsoft_Request_Serialization() { return Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(_input); } <---
[18:04:04] <Nasp> Like that and then change it from void
[18:04:08] <Tazy> Ah I see
[18:04:12] <Tazy> This makes a difference why ?
[18:04:58] <Nasp> Because you can end up with jit optimizing it and removing your result since it isn't used
[18:05:13] <Tazy> Ah
[18:05:23] <Tazy> What about the Dotnet_Request_Serialization_Stream , no return type here?
[18:05:47] <Nasp> That's fine then i think
[18:06:11] <jmer> ... A unit test that failed "Assert.True() failure"... and there are like 8 Assert.True()'s in that one test that can fail xD...
[18:06:15] <Nasp> Also i think you can do the Position reset in the setup / prepare
[18:06:18] <Nasp> So it doesn't count in the run
[18:06:40] <Nasp> jmer:  Yeah i hate when pople have multiple asserts
[18:06:44] <Nasp> And specially just use the true part
[18:06:54] <Nasp> Kinda why i prefer people to use fluent assertions, but even then people fuck it up
[18:06:57] <Tazy> Nasp, well It seems to execute the method over and over, so seems to be needed
[18:07:03] <Nasp> Btw there is an assertion lbirary i can't remember the name of i want to check out
[18:07:27] <Nasp> Also are you running release when running benchmark?
[18:08:11] <Nasp> Tazy:  Also can't you make one of the tests your baseline so it's easier to compare?
[18:08:32] <Tazy> Is there a [Baseline] ?
[18:08:41] <Nasp> It's a parameter for Benchmark attribute
[18:09:03] <Tazy> ah neat
[18:09:15] <Tazy> So in each case, Ill have a few baselines

[20:24:22] <GunArm> a single .app is like a shortcut to a single entrypoint so i'm not sure what it would mean to put multiple of those together
[20:25:14] <lz_> bomb: http://www.last-thursday.org/
[20:25:25] <GunArm> I also had to come up with a similar solution for regular dotnet self contained builds https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/18282
[20:25:28] <lz_> u have just 1 night to go back at it
[20:25:35] <GunArm> DevJohnC: ^
[20:26:43] <DevJohnC> GunArm, well a .app is just a directory - you can launch it like any other .app but it can contain anything - including other .app bundles
[20:27:38] <GunArm> right
[20:27:39] *** Joins: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli)
[20:27:57] <GunArm> but so you want seperate *folders* with a shared runtime?
[20:28:29] *** Parts: xtolid (~xtolid@ec2-18-218-218-162.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com) ()
[20:28:41] <DevJohnC> I want distinctly bundled .apps without paying (in terms of app size) to bundle the runtime for each contained .app
[20:28:43] <GunArm> compiling them together as one exe with arguments puts it all together in one folder obviously, and in my case it was a launchd service so it went into like /usr/bin or whatever the mac equivalent of that is
[20:29:06] <GunArm> but my program also had to add .apps to the users desktops or whatever for the sake of being shortcuts
[20:29:07] <DevJohnC> I can't compile them together because they have distinct properties for entitlements and whatnot
[20:29:23] <GunArm> so I just manually made .app folder structures and put shell scripts inside to link to the location of the files

[23:44:22] <lz_> sometimes my mouse is acting up and I just pass a finger in front of the optical thing and then it works again. any idea why?
[23:44:31] <lz_> not even touching it or anything
[23:44:38] <merced> what kinda mousepad do you use
[23:44:44] <merced> could just be dirty
[23:44:46] <lz_> no mouse pad
[23:44:54] <lz_> just a white desk
[23:45:17] <lz_> and by "acting up" I mean like the cursor is only moving diagonally; it's so weird
[23:45:45] <merced> try taking a q-tip and soaking it in isopropyl and lightly clean the sensor
[23:45:57] <merced> ive had to do that in the past
[23:46:04] <merced> and have only fucked up one of my 4 mice that way ;)
[23:46:16] <lz_> maybe passing the finger in front of it doesn't do anything and it's just that I lifted it up
[23:46:23] <merced> prolly yea
[23:46:29] <lz_> but I could swear that when it happens just lifting it up doesn't fix it
[23:46:31] <merced> you should get a mousepad tho
[23:46:40] <MaNa2k> merced, got a problem with gitignore. so my settings.json is not being ignored for some reason when i push my solution to github
[23:46:41] <merced> i use these nice gaming mats
[23:46:56] <merced> MaNa2k: was your settings.json already committed at some point?
[23:47:27] <MaNa2k> yes
[23:47:29] <MaNa2k> at first
[23:47:39] <merced> lz_: $17 for a nice view https://www.amazon.com/Canjoy-Extended-Computer-Keyboard-31-5x15-7x0-12inch/dp/B08P1WH5D2
[23:48:01] <Diablo-D3> is everyone doing that now?
[23:48:08] <Diablo-D3> just getting keyboard+mouse giant pads?
[23:48:13] <merced> MaNa2k: git rm --cached settings.json; git commit -m "blah"
[23:48:19] <lz_> why would I need a mousepad, this isn't the 90s anymore
[23:48:35] <merced> easier to clean, doesnt scratch up my desk
[23:48:42] <merced> by "easier to clean" i mean i just replace it every 6 months
[23:48:49] <merced> ;)
[23:48:51] <Diablo-D3> lz_: desks suck for tracking on high precision mice
[23:48:58] <merced> also that
[23:49:00] <lz_> it's not a high precision mouse :D
[23:49:06] <MaNa2k> mouse pads are a bitch to clean
[23:49:07] <Diablo-D3> although modern pixarts are actually pretty fucking good
[23:49:12] <Diablo-D3> cloth pads suck
[23:49:25] <Diablo-D3> I have a steelseries pad that was designed for that one cursed laser sensor everyone used for a gen
[23:49:32] <Diablo-D3> hard plastic, doesnt wear
[23:49:40] <Diablo-D3> *very* easy to clean, thus I keep it
[23:49:41] <merced> i cant stand resting my hand on hard surface
[23:49:50] <merced> i blame my upbringing
[23:50:04] <Diablo-D3> to be fair
[23:50:08] <Diablo-D3> it shouldnt be leaning into the surface
[23:50:29] <Diablo-D3> it shouldnt float, but it shouldnt be pressing into the surface either
[23:51:15] <Diablo-D3> like, my desk is hard, but I've also fixed the ergonomics enough that thats not where the weight of my hand is
[23:51:26] <Diablo-D3> the *only* thing I'd like to experiment is with a negative lift on the keyboard
[23:51:37] <be3uykpy> bpmedley, yes!
[23:51:40] <be3uykpy> i think that's what i want
[23:51:44] <bpmedley> Fantastic
[23:51:46] <be3uykpy> thank u :O i will try
[23:51:51] <Diablo-D3> positive lift is what most people do, they put the feet down
[23:51:53] <merced> i have a foam bar thingy in front of my kb
[23:51:56] <merced> works nice
[23:51:59] <Diablo-D3> merced: you... kinda shouldnt maybe
[23:52:03] <Diablo-D3> its *very* situational
[23:52:07] <merced> standing desk
[23:52:26] <Diablo-D3> like, Ive seen very dumb people actually get wrist problems because they used a wrist pad
[23:52:44] <Diablo-D3> the pad didnt do anything wrong, their misuse of the pad made them sit wrong
[23:52:51] <merced> yea i'm using it the way my doctor & PT people told me to use it
[23:53:23] <Diablo-D3> I dont use one, but Im also using the arms to do basically that under my forearms
[23:53:24] <merced> i'm sure i'm going to get carpal tunnel syndrome eventually anyway
[23:53:28] <Nasp> A real standing desk or those weird American ones?
[23:53:38] <merced> well it goes up and down
[23:53:39] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: okay, Ill bite, real?
[23:53:42] <merced> lol
[23:53:42] <lz_> the fact that standing desks exists makes me depressed AF for some reason. imagine that "for your health" you need to stand up, I mean wtf
[23:53:54] <Diablo-D3> lz_: its just as wrong btw
[23:53:54] <lz_> I just want to sleep
[23:53:56] <Diablo-D3> you need *both*
[23:53:56] <merced> lz_: tbh i felt the same way until i got one
[23:53:59] <Nasp> Well those that isn't a desk, but a weird contraption you put on your desk to raise keyboard and monitor
[23:54:06] <Diablo-D3> I know someone that has a home office that switches between both constantly
[23:54:10] <merced> oh, _those_ things
[23:54:16] <merced> my whole desk goes up and down
[23:54:16] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: thats not an american thing
[23:54:29] <Diablo-D3> its just for people who dont want to buy a new desk but want to be able to convert
[23:54:52] <Diablo-D3> Ive actually seen those more from the euro crowd, americans are like HEY WE'RE ALL RICH LETS GO BUY A $3k MOTORIZED STANDING DESK
[23:54:58] <Diablo-D3> (AND THEN GET BORED WITH IT AFTER 2 WEEKS)
[23:55:01] <merced> nothing is more satisfying than putting in teams  @General happy thanksgiving, see yall on monday!
[23:55:10] <Diablo-D3> merced: YAS
[23:55:42] <merced> then close the laptop with the attitude of a closing flipphone
[23:55:44] <merced> mmph
[23:56:42] <Diablo-D3> sad macbook sounds
[23:57:02] <merced> [sound of cracking screen]
[23:57:42] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  Only seen those in murica
[23:58:02] <Diablo-D3> yeah its weird because I learned it from europeans
