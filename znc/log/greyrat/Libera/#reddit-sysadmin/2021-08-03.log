[00:39:34] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> pdq is a third party though.
[00:39:35] <mistiry> You could set PDQ so that the packages are deployed regularly. Base it on a collection that finds any systems not on the minimum version.
[00:39:51] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> vlc and such are doing exactly what we said, they're phoning home to something that indicates a new version
[00:39:53] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you need the same
[00:40:09] <oxipital> xml and a install script
[00:40:17] <int0x1C8> mistiry, we have that set up now, the problem is some of our users have surfaces that they take home and thus are offline when deployment kicks off, or are never even used
[00:40:21] <oxipital> or a scheduled task to- run it

[00:40:37] <oxipital> ^
[00:40:48] <mistiry> yep. app calls home and asks if theres a newer version. if so, downloads and runs the installer. done.
[00:40:50] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> used to manage 1200 laptops with students that way
[00:41:03] <int0x1C8> on top of which PDQ can't tell if they are connected using a hotspot and VPN
[00:41:11] <rpifan> did the laptops leak from the roof pool?
[00:41:12] <mistiry> int0x1C8: thats why you re-run the deployment constant. like run it every day. or more often if needed.
[00:41:30] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you can make pdq detect that based on their IP scheme, which should be different on vpn then not
[00:42:02] <int0x1C8> mistiry, it runs every 15 minutes for failed machine deploys for 72 hours after initial deploys and about a dozen machines STILL manage to not get updated
[00:42:48] <mistiry> You have limited options. The app needs to call home, over public internet if you dont want VPN to be a factor, to ask for updates. 
[00:42:49] <int0x1C8> which is bad when the application updates are breaking for previous versions
[00:43:05] <int0x1C8> which they pretty much always are
[00:43:20] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> don't use time-based deploys
[00:43:28] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> heartbeat
[00:43:30] <mistiry> There is more to solve here than "how to auto update an app"
[00:45:04] <int0x1C8> our dev hacked together a system on his own for doing this, it involves manually updating a database field everytime you build a new version, the application queries that row, and if out of date it calls a powershell script that he found somewhere on line
[00:46:09] <mistiry> Then where is PDQ coming in to play, if the application already has a mechanism to check and download/install a newer version?
[00:46:32] <oxipital> int0x1C8: same approach as a web endpoint
[00:46:34] <int0x1C8> this was just implemented, after enough times the PDQ thing didn't update enough systems
[00:46:43] <oxipital> just dfferennt storage 
[00:46:55] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yep. while I'm not a fan of the powershell script there

[09:19:07] <JollyRgrs> indeed it is
[09:19:19] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> i am doing testing with my android devices once i have installed Intune Company Portal i have the rights to enroll or keep it unmanaged.
[09:19:28] <barred_owl> it is funny to see opco mgmt spar with corporate mgmt
[09:19:32] <barred_owl> and lose
[09:19:41] <xe0n> i suggest you use another device for your test lol
[09:19:42] <JollyRgrs> dingdong... i mean, we can't answer that for you... it all depends on what you want to manage and if they are company phones or not
[09:19:44] <xe0n> dont use your own lol
[09:19:49] <JollyRgrs> ^^^
[09:19:58] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> but i have a problem here i do see my Laptop devices on my intune company portal application and i have the rights to factory reset them
[09:20:02] <JollyRgrs> hey xe0n!!!
[09:20:15] <barred_owl> oh shit, xeon is here
[09:20:29] <Jay-Ros> ignore xe0n, ALWAYS test on prod
[09:20:32] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> JollyRgs : nope they are not COMPANY phones. its personal devices
[09:20:33] <barred_owl> fortunately, his intelligence is about as good as a xe0n 5160.
[09:20:36] <Jay-Ros> how else will you know if it works or not
[09:20:37] <JollyRgrs> yeah... that's what i mean by your decision varies based on if they are company owned devices or not
[09:20:49] <JollyRgrs> if they are personal devices, you need to make it clear what it means if they enroll
[09:21:06] <JollyRgrs> and i'd strongly advise to use the android for work whatever container thing
[09:21:08] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> yep thats right, we have the option to wipe their entier device hahaha
[09:21:14] <barred_owl> watching a dev block an entire project is most entertaining too
[09:21:22] <JollyRgrs> if you have the option to factory reset their phones b/c they enrolled their own device... that'll only be troubles down the road
[09:21:30] <Jay-Ros> this is why blackberry 10 is so good...
[09:21:46] <JollyRgrs> Jay-Ros: i'm not the president, so i don't need a BB
[09:22:00] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> JollyRgrs: on my android device using the Intune Company Portal i can see my Laptop devices and i can select factory reset also
[09:22:04] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> how can i disable this option
[09:22:31] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> Blackberry was used by bosses back then and my office has tons of them. what the heck to do with them and thier backed up data hahah
[09:22:33] <JollyRgrs> completely? or just for certain roles?
[09:22:45] <JollyRgrs> let your BES server just die, lol
[09:23:20] <Jay-Ros> use it as blackmail
[09:23:21] <barred_owl> destroy that BES server

[09:23:28] <JollyRgrs> by enrolling your device to intune, if you pay attn to the prompts on the screen, it most likely will say "do you agree to give permission to $X to be an admin on your device, they will be able to wipe your phone blah blah"
[09:23:29] <Jay-Ros> buy a houseboat
[09:23:37] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> Jay-Ros: HAHAH!
[09:23:39] <barred_owl> is flogging devs who test in prod a bad idea?
[09:23:48] <JollyRgrs> you'd have no devs left
[09:23:48] <barred_owl> like with a cat5o9 tails
[09:23:50] <JollyRgrs> so is that a good idea?
[09:23:57] <barred_owl> oh fuck off
[09:24:05] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> by enrolling your device to intune, if you pay attn to the prompts on the screen, it most likely will say "do you agree to give permission to $X to be an admin on your device, they will be able to wipe your phone blah blah" : yeah this is fine
[09:24:33] <JollyRgrs> so i mean, right there you realize that intune has that power
[09:24:43] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> yep
[09:24:52] <JollyRgrs> you should be able to restrict roles... but there will be someone (you?) with super admin/root/godmode who will have the option
[09:24:53] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> but why as a normal user i can wipe my own laptop
[09:24:57] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> that should not be allowed right
[09:25:06] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> yes its me

[09:25:19] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> where should i look for that option
[09:25:24] <JollyRgrs> you have a different/technical account you use for login to intune?
[09:25:39] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> yes
[09:25:42] <JollyRgrs> i dunno... we're only just getting to intune stuff, so i've not played with it... and right now, someone else is mostly doing all that jazz
[09:25:51] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> ah i see
[09:25:55] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> its fun though

[09:26:30] <barred_owl> intune that is
[09:27:05] <JollyRgrs> we're moving to co-mgmt soon, but the guys heading up autopilot are doing their thing first, then we'll work on merging them together for workstation governance
[09:27:24] <sd> 12<D​ingDongBell> nice

[09:28:05] <JollyRgrs> as many policies as you can do via intune instead of GPO... do those now

[19:56:08] <Hunterkll> NeXTstep used to be m68k, HPPA, SPARC, and x86 
[19:56:32] <Hunterkll> @QuantumFoam: the real trick for VMS software is if you're still using VAX style addressing/encoding

[19:56:46] <Hunterkll> has to be alpha/itanium style
[19:56:52] <int0x1C8> since they launched from baikonur in kazakhstan they couldn't use water to load test the pressure tanks and such

[20:42:03] <sintax2> that's awesome
[20:42:05] <sintax2> haha
[20:42:09] <Hunterkll> yea kicked it off as a hobby thing a few years ago
[20:42:20] <Hunterkll> dad had his license for wildcat! 4 laying around
[20:42:21] <oxipital> dude back home in redneck VA does too
[20:42:22] <sintax2> ha that's cool
[20:42:36] <sintax2> do they get used? 
[20:42:40] <oxipital> havent logged in in 20 years but hes still plodding away
[20:42:41] <sintax2> or just kinda there hanging out?
[20:43:14] <oxipital> i think people back in the holler use it
[20:43:20] <Hunterkll> i mean
[20:43:21] <int0x1C8> ok, I saw a headline saying "Helmet for magnetic treatment of brain tumors reduced man's glioblastoma by a third in trial"
[20:43:23] <Hunterkll> mine gets visitors
[20:43:23] <Hunterkll> shit
[20:43:25] <int0x1C8> https://www.engadget.com/magnetic-helmet-tumor-093523598.html
[20:43:25] <Hunterkll> i get uploads
[20:43:27] <oxipital> he was solidly militia tyope back in the day
[20:43:33] <Hunterkll> occasionally i have to clear out the upload dir via floppy
[20:43:37] <oxipital> so who knows what he does now
[20:43:44] <oxipital> int0x1C8: i saw that
[20:43:55] <Hunterkll> b/c it only has a 30MB HDD
[20:43:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:43:59] <int0x1C8> somehow "3 electromagnets velcro taped to a BMX bike helmet" wasn't what I pictured
[20:44:03] <Hunterkll> it's an IBM PS/2 
[20:44:09] <Hunterkll> a microchannel one, even
[20:44:16] <sintax2> lol
[20:44:25] <sintax2> int0x1C8: not at all
[20:44:30] <Hunterkll> i doubled the ram by overclocking two sticks
[20:44:38] <Hunterkll> the blue lighnting edition requires 80ns ram
[20:44:47] <Hunterkll> the non-lightning 386 version uses 85ns
[20:45:02] <Hunterkll> so i taped over some pins and solder jumpered other lines on the MPD shit to force the 85 to run at 80
[20:45:19] <Hunterkll> so it's got 8MB ram and 30MB HDD :D
[20:45:32] <sintax2> heh
[20:45:42] <sintax2> remember when that was a lot of storage. crazy haha
[20:45:43] <Hunterkll> best part? Like i said

[20:46:26] <Hunterkll> so don't have the room
[20:46:27] <sintax2> i like it. 
[20:46:33] <Hunterkll> tho one dude uploaded a file
[20:46:36] <Hunterkll> i was like lol
[20:46:39] <sintax2> to bad you can't expand the storage
[20:46:44] <Hunterkll> "1K of random data, great for cryptography!"
