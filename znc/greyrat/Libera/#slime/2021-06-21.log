[07:46:23] <rdrg109> Hi everyone! I've started using slime and I was wondering whether it was possible to edit Common Lisp code in a buffer and evaluate the expressions in a Slime REPL?
[07:48:35] <rdrg109> Found this question on SO: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42059316/how-can-i-run-a-lisp-buffer-in-slime-and-see-its-output-in-emacs but the problem is that, as stated in the answer, the results are not shown in the REPL.
[08:07:23] <rdrg109> Solved my issue! C-M-x executes slime-eval-defun, so having an available SLIME connection is enough, the problem was that I also had installed sly due to my ignorance and C-m-x was executing sly-eval-defun instad of slime-eval-defun and because I had only started an slime connection, I thought that the connection was not being recognized but it was because of sly-eval-defun being executed instead
[08:17:28] <phantomics> Yeah, thatis the typical use case for Slime

[11:31:52] <ahc> @rdrg109 is gone now. But perhaps a fair question is, is the jury still out on Sly (over Slime)?  I'm still getting used to Slime to be honest, and should really try Paredit one day soon.  
[11:33:02] <ahc> Oh, still here rdrg109 OK.

[11:59:29] <luis> ahc: well, people here are probably partial to SLIME. :) This is a channel about SLIME, after all. 
[12:01:48] <ahc> luis Understood. 
[12:03:46] <luis> But if you find something in Sly worth incorporating back into SLIME, that's an interesting discussion to have. 
[12:05:52] <flip214> luis: ah, cool, thanks!

[12:07:39] <ahc> I see Baggers flying around Slime at such high speed. Notice he did a couple of youtube introductions on the Slime home page.  
[12:08:02] <luis> flip214: the tricky bit is when to define the method. I've locally added a hook for loading such integrations after swank is loaded. It seems to work OK, though it feels like more boilerplate than should be necessary. 
[12:12:10] <flip214> luis: well, I typically have swank already loaded in my base image, so that's not a worry

[12:30:14] <Shinmera> The only thing from sly that interests me is the stickers, but it hasn't interested me enough to actually bother trying it :)
[13:12:59] <flip214> luis: when I choose a button in the inspector, is it possible to remember arbitrary data (special variable bindings) for more inspections below that part?
