[00:03:11] <zircona> stdout: you could use javascript
[00:03:46] <stdout> zircona, can you point me in the right direction?
[00:04:11] <zircona> I did a quick web search and found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36767731/how-to-prevent-double-click-event-on-submit-button
[00:04:36] <zircona> (like disable the button after it is clicked)
[00:04:41] <zircona> for a set time
[00:05:07] <stdout> thank you

[00:23:20] <FunkyBob> stdout: the term I learned for that is 'kiddy clicking'... and, yeah, having some JS disable the button is about the simplest option
[00:23:48] <stdout> lol, i like that term.
[00:24:48] <FunkyBob> there are more involved solutinos... including a request ID token and checking it in the backend...
[00:24:51] <FunkyBob> but
[00:25:02] <FunkyBob> JS is simpler :)

[00:29:06] <Augier> Hi! I didn't get an answer earlier so I'm asking again: I tried to send a email to django-developers@googlegroups.com but received a response from Google telling me that the group didn't exist or I don't have permissions. Am I missing something?
[00:31:31] <FunkyBob> Augier: well, the list seems to exist, as it keeps sending me messages... I'm going to guess you need to sign up to something
[00:32:03] <FunkyBob> Augier: what happens when you visit https://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/ ?
[00:33:20] <FunkyBob> https://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/about  the perms are listed here

[04:24:40] <Harlin> Is there a way to set a DateField as default to something like WEEK_START_DAY ... I mean WEEK_START_DAY could be any day but my hope here is to set week_start = DateField(default=WEEK_START_DAY) ... is this possible?
[04:24:54] <Harlin> for perspective, this is for a time tracker app I'm working on.
[04:25:31] <FunkyBob> Harlin: default can be a callable, if that helps?
[04:27:15] <Harlin> FunkyBob, I think so.
[04:27:33] <Harlin> Sounds like I just need to write a function that returns the "date" I'm looking for ;-)
[04:27:42] <Harlin> and then use that as the callable.
[04:27:58] <FunkyBob> yes
[04:39:57] <Harlin> FunkyBob, possible to send parameter like say date.today() with callable?
[04:40:54] <FunkyBob> pardon?
[04:41:12] <FunkyBob> I take it from your description you want it to default to, for instance, "Next Monday"?
[04:44:28] <Harlin> Hmm I'm thinking I can get around that if it comes to it.
[04:44:48] <Harlin> I could set that as a constant inside the function. Sorry mate, silly question ;-)
[04:46:48] <FunkyBob> can we just clarify what your goal is, first?
[04:46:57] <Harlin> Sure.
[04:48:32] *** Joins: rje (~rje@50.35.241.164)
[04:48:43] <Harlin> I want to create a Timesheet model that whilst having a project, user foreign keys, along with a hours (integer) field, also has a week_start date field and a week_end date field. I'd like to set a default for the week_start and week_end fields and have those set to last Sunday and next Saturday respectively. Hope that makes sense.
[04:49:37] <Harlin> Looks like the functions I'm using will give me a last_sun() and next_sat().
[04:49:39] <FunkyBob> so, you want to be able to record the weeks the task was started and completed.
[04:49:44] <Harlin> Yes.
[04:49:52] <FunkyBob> and you hope to do this by using Date fields, bound to specific days
[04:49:57] <Harlin> right.
[04:50:08] <Harlin> hours don't matter as you can see probably.
[04:50:14] <FunkyBob> indeed
[04:50:27] <FunkyBob> and Day doesn't either, really... ideally YYYY-WW
[04:50:46] <Harlin> right... I mean I could get by with week_end really.
[04:50:50] <FunkyBob> (iso8601 actually supports this, but that's no help :)
[04:51:04] <Harlin> ah. why no help, you say?
[04:51:09] <FunkyBob> oh, the timesheep entries will always span only one week?
[04:51:15] <Harlin> right yes
[04:51:20] <FunkyBob> no help, because no DBMS stores dates in that format....
[04:51:28] <Harlin> ahh makes sense.
[04:51:36] <FunkyBob> and I'm not aware of any that has a "week of year" field type
[04:51:53] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[04:51:59] <FunkyBob> so your plan is to store a single date that is within the target week
[04:52:01] <Harlin> ok ... had a feeling that was asking too much for an rdbms to support.
[04:52:03] <Harlin> yes.
[04:52:17] <FunkyBob> it's not too much to ask them to support, but i don't know of any that do off the shelf
[04:52:29] <FunkyBob> ok, so far your plan seems sane.
[04:52:40] <Harlin> I mean it can go without saying probably that if I add hours for such and such date, then one could assume I mean between last sunday and next saturday :">
[04:52:45] <FunkyBob> now you just need a function to supply "date in current target week"
[04:53:09] <Harlin> Well I think I have one that now sends a Date object
[04:53:36] <FunkyBob> a function that will return "date at start of week for given date" that defaults to today()... seems like it would be generally useful
[04:53:45] <Harlin> the one I'm using can be based off this one described here -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18200530/get-the-last-sunday-and-saturdays-date-in-python
[04:54:10] <Harlin> So far in my tests, seems to be a good function.
[04:54:39] <Harlin> yes. Could be good for others if that's what you're wondering maybe.

[10:55:34] <Xeago> I wouldn't want to re-implement list from ListModelMixin. This is what currently calls into `queryset = self.filter_queryset(self.get_queryset())` followed by `page = self.paginate_queryset(queryset)`
[10:56:11] <Xeago> I suppose I could override self.paginate_queryset..

[10:56:34] <serafeim> why not add a default ordering on the get_queryset ?
[10:57:35] <Xeago> serafeim: that'd result in a different primary order than the api-client requested.
[10:57:47] <Xeago> Or how would one add a default order on a queryset?
[10:57:57] <Xeago> Haven't come across the concept of `default ordering`
[10:58:46] <serafeim> override get_queryset and add an order_by ?
[10:59:08] <Xeago> Exactly, that'd result in a different primary order than the api-client requested.
[10:59:37] <serafeim> ah i think i understand
[11:00:11] <Xeago> If the api-client requests `-stock` as order; we can't return a queryset that is already ordered on `updated_at`. Any later order_by calls append.
[11:00:53] <serafeim> Xeago: yes that's an interesting problem
[11:00:55] <Xeago> Essentially, a lazy order_by is what I'm looking for :)
[11:01:10] <serafeim> you want order_by to work like filder
[11:01:12] <serafeim> filter
[11:01:23] <serafeim> qs.filter().filter().filter() will filter 3 times
[11:01:35] <serafeim> qs.order_by().order_by().order_by() will order only by the last order
[11:01:39] <Xeago> As databases make no claim of the ordering of records /within/ records of the same rank.
[11:02:16] <Xeago> serafeim: Ah, I thought it chained/appended columns such that qs.order_by('foo').order_by('bar') would be `ORDER BY foo, bar`?
[11:02:35] <serafeim> Xeago: no i don't think it works like this
[11:03:15] <Xeago> No indeed, it's within a single call of order_by that this must be done.
[11:03:18] <Xeago> Even trickier, hehe :)
[11:04:10] <serafeim> can't you just append the '-id' to what the user has already selected ?
[11:04:44] <Xeago> Where would I append this?
[11:04:56] <Xeago> I'd like to not throw this complexity into the front-end.
[11:05:19] <serafeim> where do you sort in the backend ?
[11:05:42] <Xeago> `    ordering_fields = ("title", "stock") ` on the viewset.
[11:05:50] <Xeago> That's all there really is, hehe. :)
[11:06:31] <serafeim> Xeago: what happens if you change it to ('title', 'stock', 'id') ?
[11:10:21] <Xeago> That'd allow the api-client to specify `id` as ordering. I'd like to not throw the complexity of undefined-order-within-orders-of-equal-rank across two levels of abstraction.
[11:10:49] <Xeago> I haven't yet identified how an api-client may specify multiple orders, either.
[11:12:21] <serafeim> Xeago: this is a DRF related problem
[11:12:25] <serafeim> in any case, take a look at this: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/71e6c30034a1dd35a39ca74f86c371713e762c79/rest_framework/filters.py#L279
[11:13:49] <serafeim> you need to override the filter_queryset method of OrderingFilter
[11:14:12] <serafeim> and add '-id' to ordering

[11:18:28] <tamere> Hello guys 👋
[11:18:52] <tamere> I set up a memcached server to use it with django and it's working well.
[11:19:21] <tamere> What I notice it's the read time that can be slow when we read with .get multiple times
[11:20:08] <tamere> Do you know any memcached tweak to improve this?
[11:20:41] <tamere> Maybe I can try with redis to see if the read time is faster :)
[11:22:04] <serafeim> memcached being slow is really strange for me
[11:22:14] <serafeim> is memcached in a different server ?
[11:22:41] <tamere> No it's running in the same server as the django backend
[11:22:53] <serafeim> hm there's no real reason for memcached reads to be slow
[11:22:54] <tamere> But I'm using TCP instead of socket
[11:23:07] <serafeim> yes i'm also using tcp on port 11000 something which is the default
[11:23:42] <serafeim> are you sure that this is realted to memcached and not sometihng else ?
[11:24:33] <tamere> The only things my route does are to read data from cache and return the json that is stored in the cache
[11:25:27] <tamere> My first idea was a django issue with the json but after some investigation I found that it's the memcached server that can be slow when we read multiple times with .get
[11:25:47] <tamere> I will install redis and see if things go better :)
[11:25:52] <tamere> I keep you in touch :)

[17:58:10] <timnelson> I love PyCharm, but I am wondering if we are at the point where VSCode can be cobbled together to support most of the daily functions PyCharm provides?
[17:58:25] <timnelson> for Django development of course
[18:04:51] <withered_wolf> I use both interchangably.
[18:04:58] <withered_wolf> I really don't see a huge difference.
[18:05:34] <withered_wolf> Pycharm does some things a little better/faster for me when it comes to code completion
[18:05:49] <withered_wolf> but beyond that? I haven't noticed much difference.
[18:06:09] <withered_wolf> Although, there are some amazing Django snippets for VSCode I wish Pycharm had that make life so much better.
[18:06:49] <withered_wolf> additionally, because of snippets, I find working Django templates much more enjoyable in VSCode than pycharm
[18:07:11] <pycode> withered_wolf, are you using an extension for django in vscode?
[18:07:16] <withered_wolf> Not saying pycharm can't do those things, but I couldn't find a way to do them easily.
[18:07:26] <withered_wolf> @pycode yeah, I use a few django related extensions
[18:07:43] <pycode> can you share them? i am using vscode
[18:09:44] <withered_wolf> I use the following plugins surrounding python/django specifically : "Django", "Djaneiro - Django Snippets", "Python Docstring Generator", "Pylance", "Django Template"
[18:14:26] <withered_wolf> I find Pycharm does things a touch faster (code completion for example) - and the 'structure' window in Pycharm seems a little faster to load than the 'Outline' window in VSCode as well.
[18:14:33] <withered_wolf> Pro's and Con's to both.
[18:15:00] <withered_wolf> I used VSCode for a couple years, now trying Pycharm for a year or two that way I can really determine which is best for me.
[18:15:28] <withered_wolf> I miss the snippets from VSCode more than anything though.

[18:58:17] <dang`r`us> i think
[18:58:27] <dang`r`us> rangefield or sth?
[18:59:16] <dang`r`us> oh, that's postgres-specific and doesn't come with its own validator it seems
[18:59:32] <dang`r`us> ah!
[18:59:40] <dang`r`us> validators=[MaxValueValidator(100), MinValueValidator(0)]

[19:50:26] <carloratm> Are there strategies to limit context processors only on certain views?
[20:04:58] <crowbar> carloratm: context processors aren't much different than a function that creates a context dictionary in a view. context = my_special_default_context(request) at the start of your view then just use that dict normally.

[20:36:34] <cusco> moldy: at the time I should be able to get back at that issue and reproduce if you're interested. I added the several fields I needed into .values() and that solved it

[22:17:10] <diverdud1> lets say i have 2 postgres databases (both made by django) which i want to sync. The datamodels are identical...but the data is not. I want to update some tables in base A with any new data from base B (new means data which is in B and not in A). Can i use data django migrations for this?
[22:19:09] <hzm74> Hello, trying to learn Django. I have setup a Django project running on my raspberry pi (ubuntu server 18.04). Until now I did the coding on my Ubuntu server using the nano-editor. But now I wanna do the coding in PyCharm running on my windows computer. Is it possible to load and run the Django project directly on my windows computer? So it loads directly from my Ubuntu-server?

[22:30:50] <GinF> diverdud1, that doesn't really looks like migrations work, unless you mean one-time sync, where both databases are connected to the project
