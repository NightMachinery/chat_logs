[03:55:10] <supersat> anyone have any luck running osmocom_fft in phosphor mode under Windows with a USRP B200? I swear I had it working a while ago but it seems like the unofficial 3.8.2.0 build packages UHD 4.0.0.0 which breaks at higher sample rates. Wondering if anyone has a "known good" pre-built package
[03:56:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> Have you tried specifying "num_recv_frames" in the device arguments?
[03:59:01] <supersat> hmm nope
[03:59:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> try "num_recv_frames=256" at higher sample rates.  May or may not work in WIndows, don't know.
[04:00:07] <supersat> worth a shot!
[04:00:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> UHD doesn't ry to guess where you want the trade-off between throughput and latency, so the default "frames in flight" parameters are somewhat low.
[04:01:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_transport.html#transport_usb
[04:06:16] <supersat> still seems to lock up >= 6 Msps
[04:06:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> What about without fosphor?
[04:08:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> What about if you specify otw_format=sc8?   [Just trying to see if this is a USB processing issue or something else]

[04:21:41] <supersat> changing the wire format helps. I can get 20 msps with the qt frequency sink with the int8 format
[04:21:52] <supersat> seems like as soon as there's a single overflow it just halts
[04:23:23] <drmpeg> That's a bug in UHD 4.0.0.0
[04:23:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> supersat: Ooooh, yeah.  There was a bug in a very-recent version that caused it to just give up after a single over-flow.  You might try with either UHD 3.15, or UHD 4.1 ?  I don't know if that's possible with your installer.  But I do recall there was a "widnow" where there was that bug.
[04:24:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> ...or "window" even
[04:32:08] <supersat> yeah that's what I gathered... just confused about how it worked before
[04:35:14] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)
[04:35:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> UHD (like any other software) can have performance-envelope changes from version to version--although usually fairly minor.  Like if it was just-on-the-edge of overflowing a lot before, it would now do so.  But I wouldn't expect major performance changes between versions these days.  But having said THAT, the interaction between apps and OS drivers can often have subtle performance implications that aren't immediately obvious.
[04:35:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> This used to happen with Linux a fair amount ca 10 years ago--same apps, same app-layer driver code, horrible performance changes.
[04:38:48] <supersat> oh hmm... I might have been misremembering and used my hackrf instead
[04:39:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> which uses 8-bit samples...
[04:39:59] <supersat> also maxes out at 20msps and doesn't use uhd...
[04:40:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> yup
[04:46:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> I've found that getting USB3 controllers to actually be able to move bulk-data at anywhere near where you expect is frequently impossible.  Regardless of tuning settings, etc.
[04:47:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> You'll observe that NONE of your CPUs are "pegged", and yeat USB is still dropping frames. Because USB was designed by kindergarten kids....
[04:48:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> USB remains ubiquitous as an SDR interface because it's cheap and widely available.  Getting your weird piece of hardware to have a USB3 interface is cheaper and easier than anything else.
[04:49:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> But on the host side?  It's often a crap-shoot.
[04:52:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> Thus endeth the first lesson.  We turn now to the book of Hymns.
