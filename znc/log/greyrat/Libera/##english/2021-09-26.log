[21:04:56] <fantazo> Want to to discuss the sensefulness of Esperanto as a common language? https://us02web.zoom.us/wc/89754914205/join?refTK=&from=&tk=&epk=CBtyNQ_baE5MF5uBLOUyQQrbWrBUFHYt2TjNaz1YWbYwgK-K4d8.zU4C4SOUFhvfcnKE&po=7&wpk=wcpk04a0e2a94b1bfbf666c8a71f71099fe7
[21:05:01] <fantazo> of the EU?
[21:06:10] <blkshp> !tr en es I don't think it's a good plan
[21:06:17] <blkshp> !trans en es I don't think it's a good plan
[21:06:18] <tinsoldier> Translation: No creo que sea un buen plan
[21:07:15] <pussipupu> I'm pretty convinced it wouldn't be sensible and also eww zoom
[21:08:22] <blkshp> Is that a link to join a zoom conference?

[21:09:40] <fantazo> blkshp: yeah, currently is a session about Esperanto for propadeutic value in the context of the currently occuring conference for the future of the EU
[21:09:54] <fantazo> (it's recorded)
[21:10:11] <blkshp> Well I'm in The UK so it's not for me :)
[21:10:57] <pussipupu> I'm in the EU, so it's not for me
[21:11:05] <fantazo> The topic is "language learning in the EU" and how maybe Esperanto could be of value.
[21:11:06] <blkshp> xD
[21:11:11] <pussipupu> (that might not be why :p)
[21:11:22] <huf> we've already got one
[21:11:40] <blkshp> English is the language of the EU xD
[21:11:42] <huf> this is the closest we've come to a single european lingua franca since fucking latin
[21:12:37] <blkshp> Liberates tu tes mes, ex inferris
[21:13:11] <fantazo> well, you could join the zoom session and then join the discussion in a polite way to make your points to the "naive" people who think otherwise.
[21:14:31] <blkshp> Thanks for the invite, please don't think we were trying to be impolite.
[21:14:43] <pussipupu> Honestly I couldn't join a Zoom session even if I wanted to

[21:16:36] <chat> TechTest thinks blkshp meant to say: Thanks for the invite, please don't think we were trying to be polite.
[21:16:52] <fantazo> I'm surely not much interested in debating that topic full length, as I normally prefer to write a blogpost and then base any discussion on this. But here I just drop a link: https://jakubmarian.com/map-of-the-percentage-of-people-speaking-english-in-the-eu-by-country/
[21:16:53] <lall-> what's zoom is that like skype
[21:16:53] <blkshp> TechTest: you need to learn when it's appropriate.
[21:17:09] <blkshp> lall-: QUESTION MARKS!
[21:17:17] <blkshp> xD
[21:17:25] <blkshp> and without a gap :P
