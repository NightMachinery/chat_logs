[03:30:58] <iShareFreedom> i want download

[03:31:41] <iShareFreedom> or others free as in freedom formats
[03:32:20] <batalie> flac is probably better, and is also free. also the mp3 patent has expired anyway
[03:32:39] <DiffieHellman> mp3 was never a good format in the first place
[03:33:06] <batalie> https://framagit.org/Ezwen/bandcamp-collection-downloader can download your existing colletion in a format you choose

[03:33:48] <DiffieHellman> ogg is a packaging format, do you mean opus?

[03:34:24] <iShareFreedom> that is technical issue

[03:34:49] <DiffieHellman> FLAC and opus both go into an .ogg container

[03:35:09] <iShareFreedom> what i lisent
[03:35:13] <iShareFreedom> when i download a .ogg
[03:35:34] <iShareFreedom> if is high size is a flac and when is less is a opus?
[03:35:34] <DiffieHellman> It depends what's in there.
[03:35:45] <DiffieHellman> ffmpeg -i *.ogg will tell you the format.
[03:35:55] <iShareFreedom> mm let me see
[03:36:06] <batalie> flac can be in an ogg container but i don' think i've ever encountered one in the wild like that
[03:36:18] <batalie> unless .flac is flac in an ogg container?
[03:36:29] <DiffieHellman> .flac is flag in an ogg container.

[03:40:58] <iShareFreedom> i cant improve it changing the format right?
[03:41:24] <batalie> right
[03:41:24] <DiffieHellman> If that's the original song format, there's not much you can do but re-encode to flac (makes it bigger, but no loss when editing the song).
[03:41:37] <batalie> yeah you could do that
[03:41:48] <iShareFreedom> ok, that is the reason by i like bandcamp
[03:41:50] <DiffieHellman> If the original song was in .wav or whatever, it's best to re-encode to flac or opus
[03:41:52] <batalie> no real reason to though. you should just rerip to flac

[17:07:25] <Noisytoot> hiya, Why would I when I can just use XMPP/IRC/Matrix without a phone number at all?
[17:09:12] <labrador> hiya, it deffo works for 70% of the population. Besides that wasnt the point.
[17:09:50] <labrador> the point was there are other factors than just working

[17:12:16] <iShareFreedom> telegram is cool
[17:12:27] <iShareFreedom> the only problem i see is the dependence of phones
[17:12:32] <iShareFreedom> that is the reason i dont have telegram}
[17:12:55] <labrador> iShareFreedom, thats not true
[17:13:03] <iShareFreedom> yes it is
[17:13:04] <labrador> Telegram is in a way a compromise
[17:13:06] <iShareFreedom> you need a phone
[17:13:13] <iShareFreedom> for star a sesion
[17:13:19] <iShareFreedom> start]
[17:13:24] <Noisytoot> hiya, Not everyone.
[17:13:26] <labrador> B/w true free protocols like matrix/irc/signal/xmpp
[17:13:38] <iShareFreedom> telegram need a phone to create a account
[17:13:40] <hiya> Signal is free?
[17:13:45] <labrador> and non-free ones like discord/whatsapp?
[17:13:47] <hiya> 100% free?
[17:13:52] <labrador> yea
[17:13:52] <iShareFreedom> no
[17:13:55] <Noisytoot> Yes, but still centralized and requires a phone number.
[17:13:56] <iShareFreedom> no hiya
[17:14:02] <hiya> iShareFreedom: +1
[17:14:11] <iShareFreedom> telegram is good program becouse is free software client, 
[17:14:15] <iShareFreedom> but the problem is this dependence
[17:14:29] <iShareFreedom> you need phone,  and is a strike haha
[17:14:59] <hiya> I suggest another program
[17:15:17] <iShareFreedom> wich one
[17:15:37] <iShareFreedom> noisytoot, i like federated systems, but better than federated is P2P!
[17:16:13] <labrador> The problems with telegram are. Proprietary server,centralized server.
[17:16:41] <hiya> https://threema.ch/en/security
[17:16:42] <iShareFreedom> propietary server is only a problem for telegram
[17:16:44] <iShareFreedom> no for us
[17:16:45] <hiya> Try this one ^
[17:16:46] <Noisytoot> Also requires a phone number.
[17:16:53] <hiya> Noisytoot: who does?
[17:16:58] <labrador> iShareFreedom, it deffo is a problem for you
[17:17:00] <Noisytoot> Telegram.
[17:17:04] <hiya> Threema doesn't
[17:17:06] <iShareFreedom> isnt a problem for you
[17:17:10] <labrador> As it cannot be decentralized without a server code
[17:17:18] <iShareFreedom> becouse isnt a SasS
[17:17:32] <iShareFreedom> yes but FSF have twitter
[17:17:50] <Noisytoot> hiya, Is Threema Android/iOS only?
[17:17:56] <iShareFreedom> so, telegram is better than twitter, except for the phone number, that sucks and arent recommended
[17:18:07] <hiya> Noisytoot: desktop native / web browser too
[17:18:21] <hiya> https://threema.ch/en/download
[17:18:22] <Noisytoot> hiya, Does the desktop client work on a GNU/Linux phone also?
[17:18:29] <hiya> .deb/.rpm available
[17:18:41] <hiya> Noisytoot: use web browser
[17:19:02] <iShareFreedom> that web client run nonfree javascript hiya
[17:19:02] <Noisytoot> Web clients are SaaSS
[17:19:10] <hiya> offers APK outside Google Play too
[17:19:11] <Noisytoot> Why not just use XMPP/Matrix/IRC?
[17:19:14] <hiya> including purchase option via crypto
[17:19:20] <labrador> Also the fact that telegram is not federated

[17:23:34] <labrador> iShareFreedom, what is your problem with phones
[17:23:41] <iShareFreedom> phones are stalin dream
[17:23:43] <labrador> Briar is the best messaging soln that exists
[17:23:45] <iShareFreedom> and only run nonfree software
[17:23:48] <Noisytoot> Stalin dream?
[17:23:50] <iShareFreedom> yes
[17:24:02] <labrador> Its torrified and runs on sneakernets too
[17:24:04] <Noisytoot> labrador, My phone runs postmarketOS. Briar won't run on it.
[17:24:05] <Andrew> dis-service
[17:24:08] <iShareFreedom> phones always run nonfree software in the second computer of comunication
[17:24:09] <labrador> No
[17:24:14] <labrador> Thats not true

[17:25:35] <iShareFreedom> becouse, they dont respect your freedom, never
[17:25:38] <Noisytoot> iShareFreedom, Not true. The second CPU is exempt and Replicant phones are RYF.
[17:25:40] <labrador> Thats also the reason x64 cpus cannot get a ryf certificate
[17:25:44] <iShareFreedom> replicant arent RYF
[17:25:55] <Noisytoot> iShareFreedom, Yes they are. See https://ryf.fsf.org/

[17:47:33] <iShareFreedom> when i destroy my phone and i run fully free as in freedom operating system GNU distribution from Trisquel dude, is so good haha
[17:48:07] <kompowiec> the biggest dependency is that p2p doesn't work, they just have to use the infrastructure.
