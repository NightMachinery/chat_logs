[00:02:27] <W> neshpion, but it isn't; as I explained earlier, in fact among programmers there is a wide variety of conventions, established through various sources. Some use t for iterator, some use n, some indeed use i

[00:03:09] <W> that i is _a_ convention, within programming, isn't in question, I think. It's more a matter of, how important is it, can a language or a library break it by assigning i to the square root of -1

[02:09:33] <mrig> CalimeroTeknik: Thank you an interesting read, the thought springs to mind that the entropy in nature, and for the loss of undo options for the sound engineer, is actually a pruning process that improves the quality of the result; The result of the calculation is fundamentally changed if there is no entropy.

[09:14:25] <fatpointer> rindolf, wndows update is very subtle
[09:14:25] <Decker> fatpointer I know - you have to pull all network connections
[09:14:44] <rindolf> fatpointer: subtle?
[09:15:37] <fatpointer> rindolf, sometimes the wsus fails
[09:16:01] <fatpointer> Subtle as in subtlelities not as in "transparent"
[09:16:29] <PlanckWalk> I was thinking subtle as in "not blatant".  If there's one thing that Windows Update is, it's blatant.
[09:16:56] <fatpointer> PlanckWalk, it has many subtle aspects
[09:17:06] <fatpointer> WSUS sometimes fails to connect
[09:17:08] <PlanckWalk> I'm sure it does.  Nearly everything does.
[09:17:09] <kosek> The Doomsday clock is closer
[09:17:13] <rindolf> fatpointer: it hardly ever works
[09:17:27] <Decker> subtle in that it does it's job mostly unnoticed - there's actually only a few times it asks to restart.... there's lots that went on that didn't need it
[09:17:42] <Decker> those times are too many to make it really subtle though :)
[09:17:55] <fatpointer> rindolf, did you have WSUS fail too?

[09:18:59] <fatpointer> It wasn't WSUS, let me remember the name of the service
[09:20:31] <Decker> rindolf :) there probably was a bomb, but the science of what made it really go as big as it did I think is quite wrong...  any He3/4+ ions detected are more like ash from un-anhillated hydrogen rather than the energtic product; and that fusion is always endothermic.
[09:21:25] <PlanckWalk> The science of fusion is well known.

[09:22:37] <PlanckWalk> *Containing* fusion is the hard part.
[09:22:48] <Decker> does it?  maybe it's fission from the core that generates the heat, that transfers to the atmosphere and gets to a critical point that it has no choice but compress into heavier elements to reduce the energy?  
[09:23:11] <PlanckWalk> No, that was observationally ruled out ages ago.
[09:23:34] <Decker> only by stating that 'this perspective of this is the right one'
[09:23:41] <Decker> that same perspective applies the other way too
[09:23:46] <PlanckWalk> By actual scientific investigation.
[09:24:32] <PlanckWalk> Also we've observed energy-releasing fusion on Earth in thousands of different ways. Again, containment is the problem, not the energy release itself.

[11:12:25] <ash_m> So, I was talking with someone about their time using queues with postgresql and I'm trying to understand how this helps in a situation where you have a ton of devices that need to write to a database. I suppose if the queue is timed, you don't have to backlog transactions (although I think PG is pretty good at that sort of thing). The other reason I can think of is that you can condense the insert into a single transaction

[12:36:49] <vermillion> fatpointer: Whatever helps you sleep at night.
[12:37:14] <fatpointer> Startup speed is more dependent on your init system
[12:37:17] <vermillion> Arahael: Well, on top of all this, it features a lot of cruft and bloat. I do consider it in my definition of "heavy".

[16:26:58] <WebStorm> or both
[16:27:20] <flareon> WebStorm: Always bet on JavaScript.
[16:27:33] <WebStorm> ok
[16:27:37] *** Quits: elnavigator (~elnavigat@105.196.103.41) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:27:37] <WebStorm> any reason
[16:28:34] <flareon> WebStorm: JavaScript always wins. Ruby was never as popular as JavaScript is now.
[16:28:56] <flareon> WebStorm: I take it you primarily want a job.
[16:29:06] <WebStorm> yes'
[16:29:08] <p0g0> WebStorm, why limit yourself to that pair of options (and yes, JS will endure)?
[16:29:25] <WebStorm> I'm currently doing theodinproject.com
[16:29:37] <WebStorm> there is a RoR path and a JS path
[16:30:05] <WebStorm> most software engineering jobs expect you do know web dev as well
[16:30:09] <WebStorm> to know*
[16:30:42] <WebStorm> I'm a graduated CS major and I'm learning web dev right now
[16:32:02] <p0g0> Your answer then is that there are two routes on a current job?  
[16:32:34] <WebStorm> not really
[16:32:43] <WebStorm> I just want advice ruby vs js
[16:32:47] <p0g0> JS
[16:32:53] <WebStorm> ok
[16:33:00] <WebStorm> I'll stick to js then
[16:33:05] <Arahael> WebStorm: Learn them both, but (in as much as I dislike JS), the JS one is probably the easier bet for work.
[16:33:35] <Arahael> WebStorm: Take a look at the various positions that you acn find.  See how many mention javascript, and how many mention ruby.
[16:34:07] <p0g0> Ruby will likely age out, but that may mean that the market for coders that can work it might improve, like the value of COBOL coders, maintaining ancient stuff.
[16:34:07] *** Joins: jamea (~jamea77@177.239.82.167)
[16:34:41] <WebStorm> more pay but a horrible work experience
[16:35:16] <p0g0> It gets hard to be confident about any one language, and if my time is any guide, expect to keep learning many new ones over the coming decades.
[16:35:17] <WebStorm> in my city there are 1,585 javascript jobs and 103 ruby jobs
[16:35:40] *** Joins: ash_m (~androirc@user/ash-m/x-3292451)
[16:35:41] <WebStorm> that's an increase by a factor of 10
[16:36:47] <WebStorm> however there are 2,577 java jobs
[16:37:02] <WebStorm> but programming is java is like putting your **** in a blender

[16:39:14] <Arahael> I personally suggest learning a new language a year :)
[16:41:03] <deniska> WebStorm: I don't think the number of jobs alone is a good metric. Sure you want more jobs available, but also less competition, and more enjoyability
[16:41:28] <deniska> once you take these into account, JS vs ruby is not as clear of a choice
[16:41:41] <p0g0> The fact that so many jobs are unfilled might be a clue.

[16:42:12] *** Joins: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun)
[16:42:51] <WebStorm> there is a high supply from the employers, and a low demand from the workforce

[16:43:45] <p0g0> Not enough money, bad work, etc...
[16:43:46] <deniska> and once you get a job, you have a job, so it doesn't even matter that much whether there're 100 positions open, or 1000
[16:43:57] <deniska> chances are you won't even have 100 interviews before you find something
[16:44:25] <p0g0> WebStorm, I'd offer that you might want to look at the next job as someting that begins to define your resume`.

[16:44:59] <WebStorm> I mean I'm good at computer science, web development is not really what I trained for
[16:45:00] <p0g0> In that context, taking bad work or working for a lame employer may have more costs, nixing you from future opportunities.
[16:45:14] <WebStorm> I literally did comp sci at university
[16:45:22] <WebStorm> they don't really teach us web dev
[16:45:48] <deniska> WebStorm: a typical computer science course isn't really related to a typical computer engineering job
[16:46:00] <WebStorm> I guess
[16:46:43] <WebStorm> I mean I guess it's like being a chemical scientist as opposed to a chemical engineer right
[16:47:04] <WebStorm> or a physicist as compared to a mechanical engineer
[16:47:22] <p0g0> Yes, and often the CS majors don't get a lot of plain old coding experience.  Decades ago, the liklihood of being employed in the field that you majored in drops as you proceed up the education scale, like 50:50 for a 4 year grad, down to about a 25% chance for MS, and down to about 5% for Phd's.
[16:47:58] <WebStorm> yeah because employers gotta pay you more the more xp you have
[16:48:00] <p0g0> I don't know current numbers, but I suspect it has not improved much.
[16:48:09] <WebStorm> like academic xp
[16:48:18] <p0g0> That and the niche you are filling gets smaller and smaller.
[16:48:19] <WebStorm> unless you work for faang
[16:48:46] <WebStorm> if you have a PHD I'm sure faang will want you
[16:49:07] <WebStorm> but your average web development boutique, not really right
[16:51:10] <WebStorm> so if there are heaps of javascript jobs not being taken, maybe that's a sign everyone hates javascript
[16:51:22] <WebStorm> or people just don't know javascript?
[16:51:26] <WebStorm> this is getting too hard
[16:51:42] *** Quits: jamea (~jamea77@177.239.82.167) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[16:52:17] <p0g0> well, it may just mean that the pay is bad.
[16:52:42] <p0g0> That employers are lowballing their job offerings.
[16:53:01] <WebStorm> I guess the pay reflects supply and demand
[16:53:08] <WebStorm> if there are lots of javascript devs
[16:53:15] <WebStorm> the employers can lower their salaries
[16:53:37] <p0g0> Hmm, it may, but it may also just be an opening bid in the deal making that becomes your job and paycheck.
[16:53:39] <mrig> phd's would logically be starting companies, not looking for jobs.
[16:53:52] <WebStorm> true

[16:54:07] <p0g0> mrig, I don't buy that at all.

[16:55:19] <WebStorm> but it's all theory theory theory
[16:55:32] <p0g0> mrig, fwiw, my old man's doctorate got him work with many companies.  He could not have stayed in the field (light sensitive compounds on his own.
[16:55:32] <WebStorm> not real world stuff
[16:56:05] <p0g0> He authored 75 patents, and did not own any of them...

[17:30:57] <rindolf> pulse: and itt likely will result in less money
[17:31:09] <pulse> rindolf, yes, ironically enough
[17:31:10] <vdamewood> pulse: A book I have lists "Kako gre?" as "How are you?". I've figured out that 'kako' is how. But what exactly does 'gre' mean literally, and which conjugation is it?
[17:31:34] <pulse> vdamewood, "kako gre" translate literally to "how is it going"
[17:31:45] <deniska> pulse: we have a term for producing good code while only caring about money, it's called "technical dept" :)
[17:31:48] <pulse> "gre" is a form of verb "iti" which is "going"
[17:31:53] <deniska> debt even
[17:32:01] <vdamewood> pulse: So, gre is third-person singular?
[17:32:32] <vdamewood> That explains why there isn't a dual or plural form.
[17:32:41] <pulse> i think so yes
[17:33:03] <pulse> "žoga gre" means "a ball is going"
[17:33:10] <pulse> so yes 3rd person.. i think
[17:33:13] <flareon> vdamewood: Which language is this?

[17:42:22] <flareon> pulse: Which is your favourite language?
[17:42:23] <pulse> in slovene that's never a problem, you could see a word for the first time and accurately guess how it's pronounced

[17:42:55] <pulse> serbocroatian has by far the most colorful swearing capabilities
[17:43:10] <pulse> english is useful and very expressive, and fluid

[18:51:08] <CalimeroTeknik> so how can anything be changed if there is no loss of data?
[18:51:08] <mrig> if there is to much data the net result is not a elegant as the result obtained when entropy is also playing a part in the process.
[18:51:20] <mrig> to such an extent that it is artificially added.

[18:53:53] <mrig> Oh this is all quite easily explained with math.
[18:54:04] <CalimeroTeknik> and back to the reversible computation thing, if a computation is reversible, it keeps the choices available and no entropy is added, right?
[18:54:21] *** Joins: ash_m (~androirc@user/ash-m/x-3292451)
[18:55:05] <mrig> But more computation thus more energy required to preserve that state, so it would depend entirely upon the value of that information.
[18:55:45] <CalimeroTeknik> it's the complete opposite in the paper I think: they avoid adding entropy in order to save energy
[18:56:19] <mrig> If the entropy is a part of a greater system, it could arguably add and not detract from the final state, is what I think that I am saying; This would depend upon your understanding of entropy of course.

[21:29:44] <ash_m> I was talking to someone in #postgresql about queues funneling into a db. The idea is to get better throughput from 1000s of machines writing all the time, but I'm trying to understand why that is.

[21:29:55] <nitrix> It started with the cute observation that information was travelling "instantaneously", then you have stuff like yours where the consequences of an action are deterministically instantaneous but still has to "play out physically" in time.

[21:36:04] <nitrix> mrig, There was another messed up experiment where they were showing random images to students and they asked them to say if they recalled seeing the image before. For some of them, they decided to show them unique images AFTER the experiment was over, and for some reason, the group they chose always coincided with the ones that had the best recall rate.

[21:41:51] <mrig> wovixo to be honest I steer fairly clear of this sort of area, I find the fundamentals of reality and probability perplexing enough as they are without the need to add extra complexity to it; In a way that the fundamentals of whatever is underlying the fabric of reality need to be very clearly defined before explaining larger or more extensive phenomenon.

[21:45:11] <mrig> nitrix: there are curious phenomenon for sure, but again, if the foundations are not really solid this is really hard to measure in any tangible way.

The quantum slit and split light is a very foundational work, how the apparatus interact with the measurement is fascinating enough alone, no idea at this point how I think about
