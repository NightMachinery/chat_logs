[00:09:20] <noahmg123> Hello! I am helping upgrade the PHP version on a friend's server that's running WordPress. I upgraded it from 7.0 to 7.4, but the admin panel is still complaining it's at 7.0
[00:10:23] <da_wunder> maybe you need to reload/restart your webserver

[00:10:48] <noahmg123> tried that
[00:10:58] <noahmg123> I think I found out the issue though
[00:11:12] <noahmg123> the php-fpm7.0 service was still running
[00:11:41] <da_wunder> si you haven't restarted that php-fpm then
[00:12:04] <da_wunder> s/si/so
[00:12:44] <noahmg123> It appears so
[00:12:58] <noahmg123> not sure how to tell WP to use the new 7.4 service

[00:14:13] <da_wunder> try to understand that is not really php problem - it's problem in your environment - and we don't know what you're using apache, nginx, some other and php-fpm
[00:14:40] <noahmg123> yeah, I see that
[00:14:58] <noahmg123> it's using nginx, so I'm going to look into that

[00:15:50] <da_wunder> so then you need also reload nginx
[00:16:59] <noahmg123> ok, will it pick up the new one automatically?
[00:17:37] <noahmg123> it did not appear to do so
[00:17:43] <noahmg123> I'll look more into it
[00:17:49] <da_wunder> cannot be sure, because we don't know your infra
[00:18:01] <da_wunder> then I would try to restarted it
[00:18:04] <biberu> noahmg123: how did you perform the upgrade?
[00:18:45] <da_wunder> and really make sure that you've upgraded to php 7.4 - just run `php --version` where you did that upgrade
[00:18:47] <noahmg123> biberu: well the server was on freaking Ubuntu 16.04, so it required two release upgrades for it to even get to 7.4
[00:18:54] <chazy> how does the magic from arrow functions scope work? i can pass a callable anon function referencing variables from outside and it works?
[00:18:56] <noahmg123> da_wunder: that's the very first thing I checked

[00:19:42] <noahmg123> 7.4*
[00:20:09] <biberu> what does php-fpm --version say?
[00:20:22] <noahmg123> command not found
[00:20:30] <noahmg123> but the package is installed
[00:20:50] <noahmg123> somewhere though, the site is relying on the `php-fpm7.0` service.
[00:21:08] <da_wunder> check your nginx configuration
[00:21:34] <noahmg123> I did skim through it, there appears to be no direct reference to it
[00:21:45] <noahmg123> at least not under the name "7.0"
[00:22:47] <biberu> you could try to grep the config files for fpm
[00:23:04] <da_wunder> maybe you installed that php 7.4 to same machine and now you've 7.0 and 7.4 there, and default nginx config is using the 7.0 as it's the default
[00:24:42] <noahmg123> well both the`php-fpm7.0` service and the `php-fpm7.4` are running. If I stop the former, the site goes down.

[01:58:57] <__adrian> but if you have the option, highly recommend PDO instead.

[01:59:20] <__adrian> if you do/must choose mysqli, then DO NOT USE the mysqli_* functions. use the object-oriented api.
[01:59:24] <__adrian> no problem
[01:59:32] <__adrian> do you know what "sql injection" is?
[01:59:38] <smoking_gnu476> Yes
[01:59:51] <__adrian> can you explain how you understand it, very briefly?
[02:01:12] <__adrian> like, what's the basic cause of the problem that make sql injection work?
[02:01:28] <smoking_gnu476> An attacker sends an input that exits a string and then it executes code. An example would be thing'); DROP TABLE Users;
[02:01:51] <__adrian> and WHY does that string (which is supposed to be data) get executed as code?
[02:02:10] <smoking_gnu476> Because it is sent as a command not a parameter?
[02:02:37] *** Quits: nomad1 (~nomad@user/spacenomad) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:02:53] <__adrian> ^ it's put _together_ with the SQL. that makes it easy to _confuse_ which parts are supposed to be sql, and which parts are supposed to be data.
[02:03:00] <smoking_gnu476> Ahh
[02:03:01] <__adrian> sql injection is _confusion_.
[02:03:20] <__adrian> using parameters prevents this, becuase it NEVER PUTS THE SQL AND THE DATA TOGETHER.
[02:03:45] <__adrian> it ALWAYS keeps them separate, so they can never be confused. even inside the database, they are never put togetther.
[02:03:48] <__adrian> s/tt/t/
[02:04:11] <__adrian> prepare() sends the SQL, with no data.  execute() sends the data, with no sql.

[02:20:41] <__adrian> first, are you (must you?) stick with mysqli? are you in a position to try PDO? i ask because it's easier to learn, harder to make mistakes, and there are lots more people happy to help you with it.
[02:20:53] <Blondie101010> PDO makes it a lot simpler
[02:21:09] <__adrian> either works, to be clear.
[02:21:30] <smoking_gnu476> Okay, noted
[02:21:45] <Blondie101010> right now you're not binding to any data
[02:21:48] <__adrian> ^
[02:21:53] <smoking_gnu476> ??
[02:22:17] <__adrian> so, the syntax and which methods you use varies between the two, but the core concept is:
[02:22:43] <__adrian> - put parameter markers in your sql. like  INSERT INTO foo (a,b,c) VALUES (?,?,?)
[02:23:12] <__adrian> - bind data to those parameters. with mysqli, you use bind_param(); with PDO you can simply pass an array of data via execute().
[02:23:19] <__adrian> - then execute the statement.

[12:36:48] <AllenJB> View the source of the image and check if it contains any PHP errors.

[16:00:24] <faktor> I can enable the repo , I can see the package in the repo, but cant get access to the repo.
[16:04:26] <Blondie101010> if you had given a real error message/output, I could have hinted you towards something, but these questions are not PHP related, so you should consult with your sysadmin or Centos support, but basically just following a 3 step tutorial works 99.99% of the time for that
[16:06:14] <faktor> Okay thanks . no php error. Just access to precompiled package(I can see in on the server) is missing from the repo.
[16:06:40] <Blondie101010> that's not even what I meant...  you say something didn't work but not what it showed you
[16:07:24] <Blondie101010> I can only assume that you didn't `abracadabra php-extensions` and expect it to work, but I can't know that
[16:07:26] <faktor> yum search php-stats  comes up empty from REMI repo. Not in list
[16:07:53] <Blondie101010> ok so that's probably not the name..  what's that extension?

[16:11:34] <faktor> okay
[16:12:06] <Blondie101010> so look at your yum config for those exclusions, and make sure the remi repo is otherwise functional
[16:12:10] <faktor> Can I unexcluded or is it a reason

[16:12:22] <Blondie101010> it's your system

[23:24:26] <chazy> is it redundant or unecessary to use phpdoc comments if i already specify the types?
[23:24:46] *** Joins: php-bot (~php-bot@box.croustillant.ch)
[23:25:01] <AllenJB> I consider it redundant. I only add phpdoc if they add more information
[23:27:29] <judah> A good rule of thumb is to not document what you are doing, as that is pretty obvious so long as you write good code. Instead document the "why" part, why are you doing things a certain way?
[23:28:08] <judah> For example a phpdoc that says "@param bool|null $whatever" does not help when your function already says "function foo(?bool $whatever)"
[23:28:51] <judah> But describing what behavior differences exist between bool|null and _why_ it is that way, is immensely helpful
[23:29:13] <gcds> hmm, how would you name/prefix two types of interfaces read only/writable, I am trying to figure out good naming but it's pretty hard and ReadOnlySomething sounds bit dump:D
[23:30:45] <judah> Another rule of thumb for inheritance, and of course everyone has their own opinions; Traits describe that something has a certain behavior. Interfaces describe a method of interacting. For example, you might have a "Commentable" interface and a "HasComments" trait
[23:31:43] <gcds> Yeah thats what I was using before, but I am looking how to add another interface which adds abitility to mutate properties
[23:32:06] <gcds> also good suffix for trait is `CommentsAware`
[23:32:06] <judah> Interface names work best if you are asking the question "Is this X", then just fill in the blank for X. Can it be serialized, that would make it serializable. Kinda like that.
[23:33:26] <gcds> Yes, for e.g. I have interface `Visibility` which has methods `isPublic` `isProtected` and etc. Now how you would call interface which extends `Visibility` and adds methods `setPublic` `setProtected`
[23:34:32] <Sammitch> there's always the option for namespaces
[23:34:56] <Sammitch> gcds\project\interfaces\Visibility\Public
[23:35:04] <judah> I would break it up further. Interfaces for IsPublic, IsProtected, SetPublic, SetProtected
[23:35:50] <judah> Or CanBePublic, CanBeProtected, and so on
[23:36:09] <gcds> yes, but having two same name interfaces is bit pia when autocomplete suggest, but it's good point, but again how would u call them Mutable\Visibility?
[23:37:52] <judah> Nothing says you cant change it in the future. In these cases I stick with what sounds natural and change if I need to later
[23:38:06] <judah> Programming is easy. Naming things is hard.
[23:38:09] <gcds> Yeah, especially now with PHPStorm:D
[23:38:14] <gcds> Exactly

[23:50:51] <faktor> Can I compile a PHP ext from a config.m4
[23:51:04] <__adrian> or is it something that inspects other objects (ala reflection)?
[23:54:45] <gcds> it's lib which basically parses to definitions with all fancy type inference and same definitions used to make stuff, for e.g. I can make a Wrapper class from interface definition
[23:55:12] <__adrian> i see
[23:55:19] <__adrian> does reflection not cover what you need?
[23:57:18] <gcds> reflection requires code to exist, this is more static analysis, with more indepth parsing of psalm/phpstan types, which later lets me use that information for many things, one of them for e.g. generating TypeScript types, another is tool which lets me quickly generate code based on interfaces/classes and etc, when u need to wrap something
[23:58:34] <gcds> parsed/cached once, lets me have much faster inference and similar things instead of doing reflection, then type inference
