[00:55:52] <NoiseEee> hey folks, i have a column in my database that is a tinyint, really just a 0 or 1 for queries.  Usually I index any column that would be used in a 'WHERE' or 'JOIN' query, but I've since read that for a column like this, an index is unnecessary.  thoughts?

[01:40:04] <Mmike> I'll just do a test run with this size, then that size, then some other size, and try to extrapolate from there.

[10:43:08] <gulzar> Xgc something new to learn :)
[10:43:20] <Xgc> gulzar: Usually, you'll want to correct the design so that the number is stored in a separate column.
[10:44:17] <gulzar> it's an old db. Noted, will keep in mind on moving to new versions
[10:45:14] <gulzar> Xgc one exception is occuring. there are some numbers like this R959_962, 959_962 gives error Truncated incorrect INTEGER value
[10:45:18] <gulzar> Xgc thank you
[10:45:25] <Xgc> You can also alter the table to add a new generated column that contains just that number, automatically.
[10:45:51] <gulzar> Xgc good idea
[10:45:52] <Xgc> gulzar: What do you want to do with the underscore, just remove it to concatenate into one number?
[10:46:15] <Xgc> or grab the first number and remove the _following?
[10:46:38] <gulzar> Xgc: its a range, so take the second number and sort with it
[10:47:18] <Xgc> gulzar: Not sure what you mean by "take the second number".  Do you mean ignore the first number and take the term following the underscore?
[10:47:23] <gulzar> yes
[10:47:47] <Xgc> What version do you use: SELECT VERSION();  ?
[10:48:15] <gulzar> a minute , I will login to server and check. mine is latest

[11:05:55] <Xgc> gulzar: I included both in that fiddle.  Use the second to handle both cases.
[11:06:15] <Xgc> gulzar: Here's just the solution for your new requirement.  It handles both cases: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.6&fiddle=7faac5af718beb7c156e52ed08895ce1

[11:07:12] <gulzar> Xgc thank you
[11:14:57] <gulzar> Xgc only three digits are coming up at top. There can be 4 digits also, R4893  . Is that getting affected by '2'?
[11:16:06] <gulzar> they are like R1..R36...R2000...R4800.   in future R12000
[11:18:07] <Xgc> gulzar: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.6&fiddle=5dd42bf6efc757ce3ce588613a14f04e
[11:18:24] <Xgc> gulzar: Same expression.  Correct result.  Not sure what you did wrong.
[11:18:35] <gulzar> Xgc, will check. Thank You
[11:20:05] <Xgc> gulzar: Did you replace both literals with the correct column name?
[11:21:20] <gulzar> Xgc my complete query:   "SELECT * FROM  failed_samples_view4 WHERE decided_status IN ('-','None') AND runid NOT LIKE '%test' AND runid NOT LIKE '%X%' ORDER BY substr(substr(runid, 2), instr(substr(runid, 2), '_')+1) desc limit 100"
[11:21:46] <Xgc> How did you determine the ORDER BY was wrong?
[11:22:51] <gulzar> the resulting values, the highest I have in the table is R4893
[11:25:38] <Xgc> gulzar: You're probably mistaken.  Here are all the test cases in one query, at the end of the fiddle: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_8.0&fiddle=e58b9f180a296087d032ee295dcc930b
[11:25:56] <Xgc> I needed to use 8.0 for that WITH clause.
[11:26:14] <Xgc> Could have used a derived table, but this is cleaner, imo.
[11:26:46] <Xgc> gulzar: You probably have some data that you didn't expect.
[11:31:21] <gulzar> Xgc https://paste.debian.net/1235299/
[11:34:13] <Xgc> gulzar: Sorry.  I removed the cast when you asked mainly about the string logic.
[11:34:20] <Xgc> Just add the cast.
[11:36:21] <gulzar> Xgc there are many substr. which one needs cast
[11:36:58] <Xgc> gulzar: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_8.0&fiddle=0b5486f157ba1cb16f357dabf04f3f1b

[11:37:47] <Xgc> The result of the entire string expression then needs to be cast, as shown.
[11:40:53] <gulzar> I was missing double brakcets
[11:42:11] <gulzar> Xgc, in this case I have separtion by '_' . can we add multiple delimiters. let's say some other column contains   _  ,  -,   :     etc. So can we split by multiple delimiter for same location?
[11:43:14] <Xgc> Yes.  Several ways.
[11:46:09] <Xgc> A simple approach is to replace N-1 times, once for each extra separator, each replace just replacing with the default _ separator.  I would probably use a derived table to do that just once.  Then refer to that in the outer ORDER BY expression.
[11:47:57] <gulzar> Xgc this db is messed up. Cleaning will be a good option.

Issue the last entry at id 48  . that 'tid' makes python connection cursor to throw Exception:     (1292, "1292: Truncated incorrect DOUBLE value: 'ebe82ad1438c25c6f3cce197611376c8e8eda018'", None)   . Any idea why this entry is doing this. tid is varchar
[15:26:02] <Isotopp> unclear, and not a problem at the db level. this is python going off the rails for some reason
[15:26:40] <gulzar> Isotopp feels like.  Asking in python
[15:26:51] <Naktibalda> what query did you use? you asked about casting before
[15:27:19] <Naktibalda> the error is mysql's
[15:27:23] <Isotopp> gulzar: show python paste. also what Naktibalda says
[15:27:50] <gulzar> Isotopp, Naktibalda:  to fetch the data https://bpa.st/OWAQ , to add the data https://bpa.st/MAHQ
[15:28:06] <gulzar> I doubt the adding data part. if those "{}" are messing somehow
[15:28:31] <gulzar> I can insert at once, but using loop just for now :(
[15:28:52] <Isotopp> is this mysqlclient or a different connector?
[15:29:40] <gulzar> Isotopp: mysql.connector.django
[15:29:57] <gulzar> it is mysql.connector
[15:30:01] <Isotopp> k. don't know that one, but the {} look weird. the format looks weird, too
[15:30:10] <Isotopp> that is not a thing that should be done

[15:32:12] <Isotopp> as in cursor.execute(cmd_with_percent_s, ( t1, t2, t3 ))
[15:32:17] <Naktibalda> definitelly ask python about using parameterized statements correctly
[15:32:27] <Isotopp> where (t1, t2, t3) is a tuple of values to match the %s in the cmd
[15:33:08] <Isotopp> for mysqldb (pip install mysqlclient), the parametrized form is safe, https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/28/python-where-in.html discusses that
[15:33:20] <Isotopp> other connectors are known to have problems
[15:43:30] <gulzar> did the change, still same error. same error code 1296.
[15:54:04] <Naktibalda> have you identified if it happens on SELECT or on INSERT?
[16:04:52] <gulzar> after doing the insert. If I do select then it throws the error
[16:04:59] <gulzar> not on insert but on select
[16:05:59] <gulzar> the command which throws this error is the cursor.fetchall()  or if looping over cursor to print data

[16:40:38] <Naktibalda> CyberCr33p: you could remove that unnecessary LEFT JOIN
[16:40:53] <CyberCr33p> ok
[16:41:20] <Naktibalda> your query uses index for join
[16:41:35] <Naktibalda> but it reads all rows from posts table
[16:41:43] <CyberCr33p> ok thank you
[16:47:54] <gulzar> Isotopp: looking into that
[16:51:43] <Isotopp> gulzar: the article you link hints at a broken SET clause in an UPDATE statemennt, so actually seeing the SQL that is being sent would indeed be beneficial
[16:58:10] <gulzar> Isotopp thank you

[23:06:41] <last1> I am trying to import into mysql some data that I exported using mysqldump and it gives me this error: ERROR 1406 (22001) at line 3735: Data too long for column 'first_name' at row 1
[23:06:53] <last1> how can it be too long when the data already exists and was exported ?
[23:14:55] <lopid> has any system config changed since?
[23:15:01] <last1> no, it's last night's backup
[23:15:01] *** Quits: mmlj4 (~mmlj4@ip174-69-109-162.no.no.cox.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:15:38] <last1> it is however a value with utf8 characters, the field is defined as: `first_name` varchar(90) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
[23:15:54] <last1> and the value to be inserted is 90 characters long
[23:17:05] <lopid> nobody has edited the dump?
[23:17:36] <last1> no
[23:17:48] <last1> which is what worries me too because I trust these backups
[23:18:28] <lopid> so if you were to take a dump then immediately import it, it'd error so?
[23:19:25] *** Quits: Intelo (~Intelo@user/Intelo) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:20:10] <last1> I checked the live db, select char_length(first_name),first_name from ab_contacts. it shows 91
[23:20:20] <last1> the column size limit is 90
[23:20:24] <last1> how can this be
[23:21:51] <lopid> you could change the dump to 91 just to see if it'd work
[23:22:01] <last1> it does, I changed it to 100 and it's going along just fine
[23:22:07] <last1> but still odd
[23:22:16] <lopid> hmm

[23:37:31] <last1> yep, that's what I'm thinking
[23:51:15] <Xgc> last1: You could be importing into a table that has a different default character set, which leads to a larger size requirement.
[23:52:17] <Xgc> last1: It's common problem when dealing with different character sets.
[23:57:03] <Xgc> I suspect if you make sure the same character set is used, the problem might go away.
