[14:15:56] <JakeSays> i think so

[15:24:14] <Logiar> It's part of this https://github.com/Logiar/Pekkupekku what I'm working on atm is showing details for a single app where the backend pretty much proxies a request to ex https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=1475810 and returns the json string. Did the deserialization for the other ones and doing this one was intentionally for working with the json this way.

[20:41:55] <GetShwifty> so ms new "WebApplication" builder change in .net 6.0 where they say "your old code will continue to work" and it does. but the exact same code, copied and pasted into a new project vs falls over
[20:42:27] <GetShwifty> and somehow they got it to not look at the application.config file ?
[20:42:57] <GetShwifty> cause 3 old projects are configured in there, the new project isn't. and copying and pasting all of the ncessary sactions and adjsuting names.. elicited in the same "vs can't connect to ...'
[20:49:19] <MatthiasVance> application.config?
[20:51:12] <GetShwifty> yeah
[20:51:24] <GetShwifty> hidden in the .vs folder it's how IIS Express for a solution is configured
[20:51:39] <GetShwifty> you only ever need to go into it if you ever need to let other team members / etc view your kestrel instance
[20:51:46] <GetShwifty> whichj from my perspective i ALWAYS need
[20:51:53] <GetShwifty> but i guess nobody else ever needs it
[20:52:21] <GetShwifty> so hidden i there you can configure alternate ports, alternate ips / hostnames it listens on aside from the localhost one
[20:53:50] <GetShwifty> the funny thing is i see it's lisetning on the port it's supposed to
[20:55:20] <MatthiasVance> Ahh
[20:56:21] <GetShwifty> syeah same exact code is behaving two different ways
[20:56:41] <GetShwifty> in one - the one that works configureKestresl never calls the configure handler (where i set up my ips)
[20:56:52] <GetShwifty> it gets called, it just never calls the handler inside the method
[20:57:18] <GetShwifty> in the one that doesn't work ConfigureKEstrel is called and it calls the handler inside the method. and sets up the ip /port binding but then vs fails to 'connect'
[20:57:37] <GetShwifty> which i guess is fine technically that code somehow has always magically never been called when iis express issupposed to be handling it
[20:58:01] <GetShwifty> but thatmagic link has been broken it seems and cant find out why/what
[21:04:38] <GetShwifty> thats interesting now its launching in a console lol
[21:05:20] <GetShwifty> curious why/what is causing it to do that . cause it fires instantly. where as the normal kestreal dev behavior is to wait until its pingged before launching it
[21:05:30] <GetShwifty> but this is literally same exact   code

[22:00:12] <Suchiman> GetShwifty: not that i'm aware.... although you could try changing the app type from console to windows application
[22:00:29] <GetShwifty> hrmm, interesting idea lol :-D
[22:00:42] <GetShwifty> its mostly annoying cause this solution has 3-5 websites that launch so
[22:00:49] <GetShwifty> 3-5 consoles that spawn
[22:01:34] *** Joins: abirtx (~abir@103.161.105.10)
[22:02:32] <GetShwifty> well the good news is albeit a stupidly frustrating change
[22:02:56] <GetShwifty> once i fix 3-5 things this should mostly work cause i'd already been using kestrel for everything it just was weirdly not ever calling it
[22:10:01] <MatthiasVance> Yeah they should really "host" those console windows inside VS :D
[22:10:12] <GetShwifty> well they used to?
[22:10:12] <MatthiasVance> I find it annoying too
[22:10:20] <GetShwifty> in iis express
[22:10:25] <GetShwifty> well et me check
[22:10:42] *** Joins: DrowningElysium (uid190788@user/drowningelysium)
[22:10:44] <GetShwifty> but previosly in iis express when you spawned 3 websites the dropdown in the output window  wold get 3 additional items, one for each process
[22:11:24] <GetShwifty> i think it's s till there sort of. so yeah, why the consoles need to be there ..
[22:13:20] <Suchiman> GetShwifty: well you can still switch back to using IIS, in which case IIS hosts the runtime in process (or out of process if you configure that) and kestrel isn't even being directly used (instead there's a translation from the IIS to ASP.NET Core data structure conversion). But when using Kestrel then it's just a regular console app that happens to be listening on a specific port
[22:13:47] <GetShwifty> yeah it's an annoying tradeoff
[22:14:04] <GetShwifty> cause under kestrel i have to hack the hioddenb application.config to let me host it on alternate ip/domain names
[22:14:14] <GetShwifty> unless ms finally removed the limitation from the launchsettings.json profile
[22:14:36] <GetShwifty> and also managing the SSL cert
[22:14:45] <GetShwifty> and it would randomly wipe your ssll cert and re-install its
[22:14:58] <Suchiman> why do you have to hack the application.config with kestrel, that file is IIS specific
[22:15:24] <GetShwifty> cause i use domain names to make it easy to differentiate
[22:15:46] <GetShwifty> so this solution has 3 web projects that launch backoffice , clientfacing.bankflow and clientfacing.consumerapp
[22:15:47] <Suchiman> doesn't change my point, Kestrel is indifferent to application.config xD
[22:16:00] <GetShwifty> unless ms has changed it recently
[22:16:04] <GetShwifty> oh
[22:16:09] <GetShwifty> yeah
[22:16:17] <GetShwifty> that's why i ssaid it's sort of an annoying  tradeoff
[22:16:25] <Suchiman> Kestrel also can't do port sharing / VHosts
[22:16:57] <Nasp> I wonder if it could be advantageous to not load the IIS middleware thingy when not using IIS
[22:16:59] <GetShwifty> i've given up the idea of port sharing
[22:17:18] <GetShwifty> but (strictly speaking while DEVing) you host it with kestrel and have complete control but then deal with annoyances such as additional consoles spawned
[22:17:25] <Suchiman> Nasp: AFAIK there's detection logic running that checks if you're actually using IIS
[22:17:28] <GetShwifty> or (host it with iis express and have to hack away any custom config)
[22:17:58] <GetShwifty> it seems like ms has made up the mind for me though cause the magic between using kestrel / iis express seems to be ...  odd
[22:18:07] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yeah and do the host binding pid thingy
[22:18:09] <Nasp> Or token
[22:18:21] <GetShwifty> so just switching everything to use kestrel both at production /dev
[22:24:20] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: So what about redirecting output for the host process to Visual Studio? :D
[22:24:24] <MatthiasVance> That would be cool, right?
[22:25:33] <GetShwifty> it used to do that
[22:26:27] <MatthiasVance> GetShwifty: Not for console apps
[22:26:42] <GetShwifty> yeah i was speicifclsly  speaking about iis express vs kestrel
[22:27:05] <GetShwifty> the kestrel output that goes to the console  when hosted as iis express go to the output window under a specific item per process

[22:49:21] <GetShwifty> oh suddenly realized one major annoyance this change to Kestrel is gonna cause is you could control+F5 3 websites, make changes and hit Control+Shift+B to make the changes ACTUALLY be compiled and ACTUALLY be picked up since it seems hot reload ignores anything happening outside of the hotloaded website project
[22:49:43] <GetShwifty> now control+shift+b a) prompts you to kill it , rebuilds, but doesn't auto launch vs just rebuilds and relaunches automatically
[22:50:03] <GetShwifty> feel like ms really truly doesn't use any of this stuff in their day to day
[22:52:35] <Guest3> on a somewhat related note... I am trying to deploy eshoponweb (https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb) to IIS server but it gives to 502.5 error after I publish the project as a folder and link a site in IIS to that folder
[22:52:50] <GetShwifty> what is 502.5?

[22:53:48] <Guest3> DoofusCanadensis my friend! you are here!
[22:53:50] <GetShwifty> in this case the problem is probably not the choice of tech but your choice of platform aka a random github project

[22:54:34] <Guest3> XD  ok... i agree
[22:55:03] <GetShwifty> might double check whether you have the .net core runtime installed
[22:55:06] <Guest3> github project runs perfectly fine when I run it on visual studio
[22:55:17] <GetShwifty> you deploying it to a different app?
[22:55:20] <Guest3> only on IIS there is a issue
[22:55:20] <GetShwifty> *different computer
[22:58:46] <Guest3> runtime installed
[22:59:12] <GetShwifty> 32 bit and 64-bit?
[23:01:20] <GetShwifty> the debugging experience is also atrocious
[23:01:47] <GetShwifty> 4 crashed processes, your existing debugger can't  attach to it because it's already trying to attach to (nothing) but it think its ineligible
[23:02:28] <DoofusCanadensis> Kestrel is?
[23:02:39] <GetShwifty> yeah the switching from iis express to kestrel in vs
[23:03:44] <Guest3> ok tell me this... when I select IIS Express on the run debug button and when I run a asp.net core project i.e hit Ctrl+F5 it opens a browser to the address https://localhost:44315 and it says "cant reach this page" but when I select "web" on that debug button the kestral runs and the browser opens to https://localhost:5001 and the site opens
[23:03:45] <Guest3> beautifully
[23:03:48] <Guest3> 64 but
[23:04:01] <Guest3> *64 bit
[23:04:15] <GetShwifty> how do you know kestrel runs?
[23:04:20] <GetShwifty> is it launching a separate console window?
[23:04:39] <Guest3> that command prompt with all the details starts running
[23:04:44] <GetShwifty> k just making sure
[23:04:47] <Guest3> alongside the browser
[23:05:00] <GetShwifty> i think ms gave up on iis express lol
[23:05:33] <Guest3> so when I close the browser the command prompt window also starts running the server
[23:06:37] <Guest3> ms gave up on making working frameworks
[23:06:52] <Guest3> they are happy with the money they are making with azure
[23:08:22] <GetShwifty> while prolly dreaming of the money they'll make from Windows 11 / 12 once they can truly lock Windows down with MS Pluton
[23:08:35] <Guest3> and apparently they are hoping .netcore will replace java
[23:08:53] <GetShwifty> don't think anybody at ms dreams / hopes that lol
[23:10:01] <Guest3> oh you should read some of the documentation and tech review blogs they paid to write about .netcore...
[23:10:25] <Guest3> they have similar dreams for xamarin
[23:10:56] <DoofusCanadensis> reminds me, I should look at the latest VS22 for Mac
[23:11:19] <GetShwifty> i thought they'd given up [on that

[23:11:47] <DoofusCanadensis> no, I keep seeing blog posts on "new beta of VS2022 for Mac"
[23:12:34] <GetShwifty> We’re moving Visual Studio for Mac to native macOS UI
[23:12:39] <GetShwifty> is that a self burn to Xamarin?
[23:12:56] <DoofusCanadensis> maybe
[23:13:26] <Guest3> lol
[23:13:27] <GetShwifty> Your feedback makes our products better << that is such a lie
[23:13:59] <GetShwifty> If you say anything negative they call you a troll. you say something is broken, they tell you to file a bug and instantly close it cause it didn't repro with tehir repro steps file -> new project -> did reported bug repro? no .. close
[23:14:24] <DoofusCanadensis> I mean, they still ship the xamarin frameworks for your apps
[23:14:47] <GetShwifty> stiull a good self burn lmao
[23:15:02] <GetShwifty> by acknowledging that they fixed 100+ bugs and performance issues simply by switching to mac os native ui lol
[23:15:44] <Guest3> holy kernel! when did they acknowledge that?
[23:15:49] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, and be interesting to see if those changes make it over to vscode

[23:16:52] <GetShwifty> 3 errors saying can't attach debugger (why are you attaching debuggger with control+f5)
[23:17:09] <GetShwifty> and can't compile projects
[23:17:12] <GetShwifty> because it is in use
[23:17:21] <GetShwifty> holy fuck
[23:17:22] <MichaelLong> looking at this right now: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-for-mac-preview-5/
[23:17:27] <GetShwifty> literally just killed all development
[23:17:30] <Guest3> i think the only respectable contribution of ms to the open source community is VScode
[23:17:53] <MichaelLong> there's a video loading a solution as a comparison. even in the newer preview it takes ages to load, why?
[23:17:59] <Guest3> GetShwifty what happens if you build the project
[23:18:09] <GetShwifty> after control+f5?
[23:18:13] <Guest3> no before
[23:18:14] <MichaelLong> this on a apple m1 supposed to be super fast
[23:18:16] <GetShwifty> oh
[23:18:40] <GetShwifty> the thing is the normal workflow is you launch the web apis, you do your workflow.. figure out what needs to be fixed. make change, hit control+Shfit +b to rebuild
[23:18:45] <GetShwifty> and it auto relaunches and reloads
[23:18:50] <GetShwifty> now you can't do that
[23:18:56] <GetShwifty> yhou have to manually kill everything
[23:18:59] <GetShwifty> then rebuild
[23:19:13] <GetShwifty> then relaunch -> wait 2 minutes , byupass 3 error messages saying it can't attach debugger (even though you're not attaching ti)
[23:19:28] <GetShwifty> like this is virtually completely and utterly unusable with how obtuse it is
[23:19:41] <DoofusCanadensis> MichaelLong: that's what I'm hoping for
[23:19:42] <Guest3> ya...
[23:19:49] <DoofusCanadensis> but then I don't have a sample project at the moment
[23:20:12] <MichaelLong> not sure what kind of mega solution they're loading in that video bit.
[23:20:23] <Guest3> helloworld
[23:21:01] <MichaelLong> I mean my Visual Studio 2019 on a shitty 4 core VM with 8 GB ram loads a real world solution faster than that.
[23:21:02] <DoofusCanadensis> helloworld isn't going to show how much faster an M1 binary is
[23:23:57] <DoofusCanadensis> ahahahaha
[23:24:09] <DoofusCanadensis> error FS0193: The specified file name or path is too long, or a component of the specified path is too long.
[23:24:33] <DoofusCanadensis> I have no idea _why_ VS22 tried to open an F# console, but yeah, that's a great out of the box impression
[23:27:47] <GetShwifty> hmmm
[23:28:06] <GetShwifty> Suchiman:  do you webapi / kestrel hosted development?
[23:29:09] <Guest3> meanwhile GetShwifty i did everything mentioned in the link you sent me and now I am getting a 500.19 error is this an improvement??
[23:30:04] <GetShwifty> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/webapps/iis/health-diagnostic-performance/http-error-500-19-webpage
[23:30:14] <GetShwifty> possibly could also be a 2 step s to the left, 2 steps to the right
[23:30:15] <GetShwifty> lol
[23:30:34] <GetShwifty> either malformed config or permissions issues (i think on config file)
[23:30:38] <GetShwifty> or root folder
[23:30:50] <Guest3> ya trying that now...
[23:32:08] <Guest3> also did you check you launchsettings.json if there is are any debug elements thats making it behave that way?
[23:32:28] <GetShwifty> afaik i can't use launchsettings.json
[23:32:39] <GetShwifty> bceause it only lets you configure localhost
[23:33:16] <GetShwifty> what i was previously doing - hacked the iis express config file , adding my own ip/domain that i wanted each one to bind to
[23:33:24] <GetShwifty> worked fine, except all new apps mysteriously wouldn't use it
[23:33:45] <GetShwifty> and then one app that's worked fine for 2 years mysteriously mid day switched to not using it while the 3rd app 1/2 as old as the 2 year old one.. still uses it
[23:34:40] <GetShwifty> this is literally one of those fall off a cliff thing
[23:34:46] <GetShwifty> yesterday i could dev/debug
[23:34:48] <GetShwifty> today
[23:34:58] <GetShwifty> cant even compile without a 5 minute ceremoy of hunting down processes/windows and closing them
[23:38:15] *** Quits: abirtx (~abir@103.161.105.10) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:43:31] <DoofusCanadensis> we're going on a process hunt 🎶
[23:43:53] <GetShwifty> this is beyond that
[23:43:58] <GetShwifty> this is tlierally show stopping
[23:44:26] <GetShwifty> it's neraly akin to shutting down visual studio every time you want to make a code change
[23:45:28] <GetShwifty> so can't "start the process without debugging"
[23:45:34] <GetShwifty> that just doesn't work period
[23:45:41] <GetShwifty> hjave to launch the debugger every single time
[23:46:04] <GetShwifty> all code changes then require you answering a prompt , failing to recompile because the process is still in use
[23:46:05] <MatthiasVance> Why do you need the debugger when making a code change?
[23:46:09] <GetShwifty> IK DONT
[23:46:16] <GetShwifty> normally what i do is Control+F5
[23:46:31] <GetShwifty> chrome open, do the things, see what needs to be done
[23:46:40] <GetShwifty> make code changes to assemby, hit control+shift b
[23:46:47] <MatthiasVance> Not F6? :o
[23:46:56] <MatthiasVance> But yeah I get it, visual inspection and reloading it
[23:46:58] <GetShwifty> iis express automatically shuts down, reloads assemblies and you go back to chrome. do the things
[23:47:02] <MatthiasVance> By the way do you know about dotnet watch?
[23:47:06] <MatthiasVance> It does that for you
[23:47:07] <MatthiasVance> All of that
[23:47:11] <GetShwifty> hot reload?
[23:47:13] <GetShwifty> no it doesn't
[23:47:19] <MatthiasVance> That's not the same
[23:47:39] <GetShwifty> all of the hot reload/watching stuff
[23:47:43] <GetShwifty> watches the Web Api project launched
[23:48:02] <GetShwifty> meaning you make changes to 13 assembles - beacuse the web api project is a dumb project without controllers, without business logic, etc
[23:48:13] <GetShwifty> they detect 'a change happend somewhere' say they recompiled... say they reload
[23:48:32] <GetShwifty> you run it and realize none of the assemblies outside of the webapi preojct (which you ASSUME got re-loaded) got reloaded
[23:49:25] <GetShwifty> and this is supposed to be auto-magical - because yesterday and for 2+ years it's worked auto magically
[23:50:56] <GetShwifty> curious what happend to project #1 that didn't happen to project #2 that caused it to mysteriously switch over to not using iis express
[23:51:26] <MatthiasVance> Launch settings?
[23:51:37] <GetShwifty> no, they all ignored launch settings along time ago
[23:51:39] <GetShwifty> well sort of
[23:51:45] <MatthiasVance> Either in *sproj or the JSON file
[23:52:00] <GetShwifty> previously launch settings configured your application.config which is hidden in .vs/solutionname/config
[23:52:19] <GetShwifty> then you could edit that config file and make iis express do what you needed it to do
[23:52:22] <MatthiasVance> "previously"?
[23:52:25] <GetShwifty> yeah
[23:52:26] *** Quits: Fairy (~Fairy@ti0004a400-5385.bb.online.no) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:52:35] <GetShwifty> literally this morning. added a new web api project to this solution.
[23:52:44] <GetShwifty> it did NOT get enrolled in that
[23:53:05] *** Quits: k8yun (~k8yun@198-48-158-40.cpe.pppoe.ca) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:53:10] <GetShwifty> then while fucking around and trying to figure out what was wrong with it . Web Api Projet #1 of 3 mysteriously 'stopped' enrolling in iis express
[23:53:28] <GetShwifty> reversing 2 years of behavior
[23:53:30] <MatthiasVance> How do you start everything up?
[23:53:36] <GetShwifty> control+f5
[23:53:41] <GetShwifty> unless i ACTUALLy need a debugger
[23:53:48] <MatthiasVance> So how is the solution configured, what projects get started how?
[23:53:50] <GetShwifty> which launches all the the web api projects
[23:54:03] <GetShwifty> the web api projects get started via the manage multiple startup projects
[23:55:23] <MatthiasVance> And your new project is configured to use IIS Express how?
[23:55:38] <GetShwifty> none of them 'were' visibly confgiured to use iis  express
[23:55:44] <GetShwifty> how it was (no idea)
[23:55:46] <MatthiasVance> A-ha
[23:55:50] <MatthiasVance> Well, fix that? :D
[23:55:54] <GetShwifty> how?
[23:55:58] <GetShwifty> there is no setting for that
[23:56:01] <MatthiasVance> What!
[23:56:22] <GetShwifty> and no setting changed
[23:56:40] <GetShwifty> i mean in theory
[23:56:44] <MatthiasVance> In theory?
[23:56:47] <GetShwifty> the launchsettings.json is 'supposed to dictate that
[23:56:48] <MatthiasVance> Got to have facts :D
[23:56:50] <MatthiasVance> ah
[23:56:54] <MatthiasVance> Yes correct
[23:56:55] <GetShwifty> there's nothign documented about that
[23:57:00] <GetShwifty> you just take it for the bible
[23:57:08] <MatthiasVance> Heh?
[23:57:27] <GetShwifty> and for the most part - the best i can say is PREVIOUSLy
[23:57:43] <GetShwifty> the launchsettings.json would drive the generation of hidden application.config
[23:57:51] <GetShwifty> it did NOT for the new projet
[23:58:04] <GetShwifty> and then mysteriously one of the 2 existing prior projects ... just 'stopped' working
