[01:57:20] <rawtaz> hi there
[01:58:12] <DoofusCanadensis> I've got a book from packt about just that thing
[01:59:01] <rawtaz> im curious about this: https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia - how is it possible for that thing to like `docker exec` execute something in another container than itself, when all it gets as per the example in https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia#docker-labels-configurations is a *read-only* /var/run/docker.sock ? i would think to tell docker to exec something it'd need write perms to that socket?

[02:22:39] <Celelibi> Preparing a Docker course. What kind of application could I ask them to make an image for?
[02:22:52] <rawtaz> how simple do you want it?
[02:22:56] <Celelibi> Something not too trivial.
[02:23:13] <rawtaz> a single image, not a couple for running with compose or so?
[02:24:02] <Celelibi> Composing several images will be for the next time. So, I'd take your ideas for that as well.
[02:24:12] <rawtaz> i see :)
[02:24:39] <Celelibi> But for now, it will be their first image, so, single image.
[02:25:14] <rawtaz> i mean it could be a simple container for some tool. for example, i've build a simple image for the AWS CLI since i dont want to install that on my machine, so i wrapped it in a docker image and just run that
[02:25:31] <rawtaz> that would mean taking some base linux image, adding the tool, possibly some dependency
[02:25:42] <rawtaz> or wait did i use an existing one,, i might have. dont remember
[02:25:48] <Celelibi> Isn't that too simple? I mean, they will have something like 3 hours on it.
[02:25:54] <rawtaz> yeah it is
[02:26:55] <rawtaz> a web server serving a few php files with apache using its embedded php modules would be a pretty standard thing
[02:27:10] <rawtaz> but there already exists such images, so they could just look at that and its done
[02:29:26] <rawtaz> i think it's more interesting making images work togehter, so i.e. docker-compose. anyone can make images, but making them work in unison is a different thing. so if instead of trying to find an image to create that isnt too simple, but isnt too complex (requiring much knowledge about the thing youre embedding into it ,which deviates from the topic at hand), and that also doesnt already exist as the first hit on google,
[02:30:04] *** Quits: Sven_vB (~sven@user/sven-vb/x-2094958) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:30:07] <rawtaz> youd have them create a couple or three pretty simple images, and then move on to docker compose where theyll have a more interesting time combining them. could be as simple as a db, a web server and a mail server (e.g. mailhog)
[02:30:30] <Celelibi> And if I choose some exotic software they will have trouble understanding its requirements.
[02:30:31] <rawtaz> i think it's hard to make them spend like 2-3 hours creating images
[02:30:55] <rawtaz> yeah. it easily moves into a matter of learning/understanding the thing youre trying to embed rather than the image creation process
[02:31:14] *** Joins: Sven_vB (~sven@user/sven-vb/x-2094958)
[02:31:37] <rawtaz> i guess the closest you could come is building an image with a bunch of dependencies and the key thing you want to run, but where the deps are simple to understand. like just a bunch of apt install and some copy config files
[02:31:42] <rawtaz> that could work.
[02:32:03] <rawtaz> and they could start by making the base image have the first deps, build that, add the second dep, see that the cache is used, etc.
[02:32:09] <Celelibi> You mean, without an actual app to run inside?
[02:32:29] <rawtaz> nah some deps ofr the final app that then is the one run inside the image
[02:32:49] <rawtaz> whatever that would be :) some web service i think is simple, then they can easily see the result by going to it in their browser
[02:33:13] <rawtaz> it would show them to expose a port and you could show them to do a bind mount where the thing serves a file from their hard drive perhaps
[02:33:56] <rawtaz> maybe a simple image that has caddy (web server) in it that runs php via fpm and a simple php script that uses imagemagick to flip an image they provide via bind mount upside down?
[02:34:11] <rawtaz> that's not too complex dependencies or software installations. and you can provide the php script for them.
[02:34:26] <rawtaz> you can also provide the mandatory cat image to flip :-)
[02:34:52] <Celelibi> Hm... maybe. :)

[02:52:58] <rawtaz> i still dont get how https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia#docker-labels-configurations can run the equivalent of `docker-compose exec` on another container when all it gets is a *read-only* /var/run/docker.sock. it's using https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient but from what i can tell that one uses the socket to communicate REST. so how the heck can it do that if the socket is ready-only? :/

[03:11:40] <Celelibi> If all there is is simple apps to dockerize, maybe I can ask them to do several of them. In increasing order of complexity.
[03:11:59] <rawtaz> yes
[03:12:27] <rawtaz> start small, have them do two or perhaps three, leave the last one as an optional one if theyre curious and its going well
[03:13:32] <Celelibi> Probably start with an alpine with bash. Then a web app, then a python app with several layers of dependencies.
[03:15:27] <devslash> has anyone here used Authelia
[03:16:01] <rawtaz> personally i would suggest using bullseye instead. it's not a fun or great start for them if they need to go into the container to debug something as part of their process (or just try commands that they intend to then put into the Dockerfile) and discover how alpine sucks when it comes to having tools.
[03:16:39] <rawtaz> theres simply no point "optimizing" with alpine at this learning stage. it's better they have tools they need

[03:17:20] <devslash> im still setting it up
[03:17:25] <Celelibi> You're not wrong. I was more thinking about them having to download a smaller base image.
[03:18:01] <rawtaz> Celelibi: is the different really that big? is the internet connection relevantly limited? they pretty much only have to download it once per user, perhaps two if they delete it for some reason
[03:18:07] <rawtaz> difference*
[03:19:09] <Celelibi> IIRC, yes the difference is pretty big. Intrenet connection as school sucks a lot. But this time the course will be in remote.
[03:19:41] <Celelibi> So, network quality unknown.
[03:20:50] <rawtaz> i see
[03:20:57] <rawtaz> you could set up oyur own repo :D
[03:21:36] <rawtaz> but yeah i hear you, might be best going for alpine. or you could just try it when you get there and tell them alpine or bullseye when you know the status
[03:22:14] <Celelibi> 100+MB for debian. 5.57MB for alpine. A 20x factor is quite significant. ^^

[05:41:51] <rawtaz> not sure how you mean, im mostly thinking of a docker-compose solution again, but one that has a reverse proxy with lets encrypt, fronting e.g. two separate other services (docker-compose solutions) by listening on labels from those other containers

[07:17:27] <nickdiazswag209> hey guys, i have a docker image my_image that uses a base image (foo), and that uses a base image bar, which is using a really old version of ubuntu (trusty). There's a lot of CVEs that are only available in Xenial. What are my options to resolve them without touching foo and bar
[07:21:37] <rawtaz> modify the my_image such that it updates the system
[07:22:43] <nickdiazswag209> well right now my_image is running trusty, so to get it to xenial, it would need some changes to /etc/apt/sources.list, and then an apt-get upgrade -y, but isn't this bad practice?
[07:22:48] <nickdiazswag209> or could seriously fubar it :P
[07:23:34] <nickdiazswag209> well i meanm every solution may seriously fubar, but isn't it bad practice 
[07:25:21] <rawtaz> nickdiazswag209: if you have images A - B - C - D where the higher letter depends on the lower letter, and the security issues is in A, then of course it's best to change A for something more up to date. but if you dont want to do that and cant modify B and C, then you're only left with modifying D. running those ocmmands you mentioend in there should be doable i suppose, its like any other system you have and need to upgrade
[07:26:43] <nickdiazswag209> yah, thats my thought as well, just wanted to see if there was a miracle :)
[07:27:41] <rawtaz> DogHackit: not finding anything on it, so i dont know. but if you stay tuned a day or so others might
[07:27:51] <rawtaz> there are some professionals in here :P
[07:28:19] <DogHackit> rawtaz: lol. Thanks! I didn;t find anything either, that is why I am here :D
[07:28:42] <rawtaz> yeah :<
[07:28:47] <rawtaz> hard to google that
[07:28:59] <rawtaz> seems everything points to setting up authentication for repos
[07:29:15] <nickdiazswag209> thats exactly the issue now... A - B - C (where higher depends on lower letter), A has vulnerabilities, B is unsupported... and C which i manage needs to be fixed. I guess my options are to rebuild completely on a base that i completely manage
[07:29:26] <nickdiazswag209> or do the apt-get upgrade -y
[07:29:30] <DogHackit> I think the answer might be envars in a compose file, but I wanted to ask before barking up that tree.
[07:29:33] <rawtaz> nickdiazswag209: what needs to be fixed?
[07:29:46] <nickdiazswag209> a bunch of CVEs, that requires apt-get upgrade
[07:30:01] <rawtaz> nickdiazswag209: i really dont see what youre hesitant about. just do what needs doing? :)
[07:30:14] <nickdiazswag209> but the image is running on an old distro release... the fixes are in higher releases
[07:30:37] <nickdiazswag209> rawtaz: i suppose :)
[07:30:53] <rawtaz> yeah and hte obvious normal way to deal with that is to update the image to a newer version.
[07:31:28] <rawtaz> if B is unsupported i gues you might run into trouble there, but it shouldnt matter much if you update A or C - B will/should still run in the same environment after that
[07:31:51] <nickdiazswag209> yeah, the "normal" (best practice) way, and what i'd like to do, is just  alot fo work. Forking A, B, basing those on a higher version, etc
[07:32:50] <nickdiazswag209> of course with my luck, the version in A is probably required for stuff done in B, which in turn stuff in B is required for stuff done in C :)

[07:39:53] <mir3g> hello. I don't understand why anyone would want to add a regular user to the docker group?
[07:40:20] <mir3g> if adding to the docker group is the same as having root access then why not just use root?
[07:40:21] <rawtaz> so that the regular user can run docker commands, which they normally cant
[07:40:29] <rawtaz> its not the same as having root access
[07:40:38] <mir3g> how is it not the same
[07:40:50] <rawtaz> with root, you can do anything in the system. being a member of docker, you can run docker stuff. you cant do everything else root cando
[07:41:17] <mir3g> I can use it to rewrite anything on the system including something that will change root password
[07:41:49] <mir3g> so maybe I should make a special docker user? and consider is semi root?
[07:41:53] <rawtaz> you mean because you run docker daemon as root?
[07:41:54] <mir3g> it*
[07:42:15] <rawtaz> well isnt that basically what youre doing with your regular user when you make them part of the docker group?
[07:42:27] <mir3g> I mean I can mount /bin as a volume and write whatever the heck I want to it
[07:42:53] <DogHackit> rawtaz: Still haven't what? Was that a miss tag?
[07:43:09] <mir3g> rawtaz, yes it is but I am not running my web browser using the special docker user
[07:43:13] <rawtaz> DogHackit: yeah sorry for disturbing your idling!
[07:43:31] <rawtaz> devslash: i havent still but is there anything in particular youre curious about?
[07:43:43] <DogHackit> lol. Just thought you might have some more insight. No problem.
[07:48:13] <mir3g> rawtaz, does docker let me mount /bin as a volume and write to it?
[07:48:18] <mir3g> as root
[07:49:25] <rawtaz> i never tried that, but i was guessing thats what you meant (you never answered my question so i wasnt sure)
[07:49:41] <rawtaz> might be something to try :)
[07:50:14] <mir3g> which question haven't I answered?
[07:50:34] <rawtaz> < mir3g> I can use it to rewrite anything on the system including something that will change root password
[07:50:37] <rawtaz> < rawtaz> you mean because you run docker daemon as root?
[07:50:44] <rawtaz> i wasnt sure in what way you meant
[07:52:18] <mir3g> mir3g 23:12:27
[07:52:18] <mir3g> I mean I can mount /bin as a volume and write whatever the heck I want to it
[07:52:30] <mir3g> answered in an unrefined way
[07:52:36] <mir3g> I am not a security expert
[07:53:00] <rawtaz> so you know that you can do that? i never tried it so i cant verify
[07:53:07] <rawtaz> i presume that in some way you can
[07:53:13] <rawtaz> if it runs as root
[07:53:19] <rawtaz> which it does i think :o
[07:53:28] <mir3g> you can
[07:53:38] <rawtaz> theres instructions on how to make it run less privileged
[07:54:00] <mir3g> that should be the default
[07:54:08] <rawtaz> anyway. in general i think its a bit like using sudo instead of root :)
[07:54:11] <rawtaz> yeah
[07:54:28] <mir3g> sudo prompts for a password
[07:55:03] <mir3g> something can't just execute in the background and get root without password prompt
[07:55:15] <mir3g> even windows understood this
[07:55:37] <mir3g> when they made prompting for admin access into a special screen
[07:55:40] <Celelibi> God, I'm so out of energy to write the exercises for image creation. The course start in 4 hours. I don't think I've slept for more than a few hours since monday.
[07:57:02] <rawtaz> Celelibi: then just go sleep and take what you have and improvise! dont worry about ut. have a discussion with them, let them help you lead towards experiments ad-hoc, and youll figure out tasks as you go
[07:57:08] <rawtaz> let them throw up the ideas
[07:57:36] <rawtaz> mir3g: of course, theres a difference. i was referring to the old "why use sudo instead of just being root"
[07:57:56] <Celelibi> Well, not this time. They need to have two grades. I think this part is a good one to grade.
[07:58:32] <Celelibi> Also, they're very passive. It's hard to have a talk with them.
[07:59:33] <rawtaz> even if thats the case, ask them questions that leads to some suggestions. surely youll come up with something to turn into images as you go. just use whatever s common. web services. dbs. compose. etc.
[07:59:34] <Celelibi> Hm. If I create an image with docker commit, is there a way to set an entrypoint and cmd?
[07:59:59] <mir3g> rawtaz, even docker docs end with "Finally, if you run Docker on a server, it is recommended to run exclusively Docker on the server, and move all other services within containers controlled by Docker. "
[08:00:00] <rawtaz> i think its more important that you go sleep for three hours (thats two deep sleep cycles, mind you) than that you try to push this planning further, it's just futile
[08:00:33] <Celelibi> I'll have a whole week to sleep after that. ^^
[08:00:37] <mir3g> I think it is reckless to be telling noob users to install docker on their personal machines and add their main user to the docker group
[08:01:00] <rawtaz> mir3g: what do you suggest should be done instead?
[08:01:29] <Celelibi> What should be done is a better UID/GID handling for bind mounts. :)
[08:01:59] <rawtaz> i always use bind mounts and never have problems with the UID/GID. i dont see what people are complaining about
[08:02:08] <rawtaz> but i think thats due to running it quite stand-alone
[08:02:19] <Celelibi> Because it gives root access to anyone who can run a container.

[08:02:26] <Celelibi> root access on the host
[08:02:39] <rawtaz> Celelibi: hm can you explain how that works?
[08:03:23] <Celelibi> Mount /etc, add yourself to the sudoers. Mount /boot, put a backdoor into the kernel. Mount any directory, write a suid root file that just pops a root shell.
[08:04:07] <Celelibi> Basically, being in the docker group gives the user root access on the host.
[08:04:46] <mir3g> exactly
[08:05:07] <rawtaz> yeah but what about someone that is only inside the container, they cant just mount the host's /etc can they?
[08:05:36] <rawtaz> e.g. if you have a vulnerable web service container that someone completely owned the inside of
[08:05:38] <Celelibi> Indeed it doesn't allow escaping the container.
[08:05:46] <mir3g> should at least require sudo to run docker so end users realize that they are executing something with root privileges
[08:06:16] <rawtaz> you could set sudo up to allow that and have them use that instead of just adding them to the group i guess
[08:06:20] <mir3g> Celelibi, emm
[08:06:40] <mir3g> if the container has access to the docker-compose.yml file they can edit it
[08:06:48] <mir3g> cause the container to crash
[08:07:03] <mir3g> and have it auto restart with their attack
[08:07:19] <Celelibi> mir3g, I'd rather see an explicit mapping of the UIDs and GIDs. So that when a file is written as root into a bind mounted directory it could be mapped to any other uid.
[08:08:13] <mir3g> the only reason root is needed is to open ports?
[08:08:52] <Celelibi> That's for writing files, for reading... we would need some more involved checks that remember the uid of the user that started the container.
[08:09:49] <rawtaz> mir3g: a container should never have access to that file, if it does then the solution was badly configured :o
[08:10:16] <rawtaz> but shit happens, thats true
[08:10:36] <Celelibi> mir3g, indeed if your container has access to many files, they can do stuff. Accessing $HOME is very easily done.
[08:10:44] <Celelibi> And it provide access to ~/.ssh
[08:12:20] <Celelibi> Anyway, any idea if there's a equivalent of ENTRYPOINT for docker commit?
[08:12:47] <rawtaz> nite
[08:12:50] * rawtaz &
[08:14:00] <Celelibi> Good night
[08:22:51] <mir3g> docker run -it --rm -v /:/host alpine cat /host/etc/shadow
[08:23:26] <mir3g> why the heck can this be done with the default recommended config??
[08:25:46] <mir3g> honestly I don't get why any documentation is telling anyone to add a user to docker group
[08:26:14] <mir3g> docker should be used with sudo so the user knows they are executing privileged commands

[13:44:44] <LordKalma> I'm honestly so puzzled haha. I did the same as a tutorial... Interesting
[13:47:09] <ikke> When does this error happen?
[13:48:28] <LordKalma> building the backend image. When it runs the `python manage.py migrate` is when it fails because the env variables weren't available
[13:48:43] <LordKalma> oh wait.... the environment variables aren't available during build?
[13:49:00] <ikke> correct
[13:49:02] <LordKalma> I have to move that command to "runtime" 
[13:49:08] <ikke> you need to provide them as build arguments
[13:49:22] <LordKalma> or move the migration to runtime, right?
[13:49:24] <ikke> yes

[13:51:55] <LordKalma> followup question: What's the better way to do it? Other than adding lots of && to "command:"
[13:52:18] <ikke> Have a script in the image that you run
[13:52:41] <LordKalma> lemme try
[13:53:58] <ikke> typically you have an entrypoint script that does some initialization and then runs the actuall command (exec python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
[13:54:20] <LordKalma> and the "entrypoint: " thing runs *after* build?
[13:54:34] <ikke> It runs at runtime
[13:54:39] <ikke> when you start the container
[13:54:39] <LordKalma> great, thanks
[13:55:04] <ikke> Note that if you specify an entrypoint, the command will be passed as arguments to your entrypoint

[18:33:46] <Tas-sos> I update this ===>  https://pastebin.com/raw/P2pjn1gi
[18:34:20] <ada_> Tas-sos: another thing I see is that container name startrs with a / and thats not valid
[18:34:23] <ada_> share your compose files, too
[18:34:39] <rawtaz> i dont get how https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia#docker-labels-configurations can run the equivalent of `docker-compose exec` on another container when all it gets is a *read-only* /var/run/docker.sock. it's using https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient but from what i can tell that one uses the socket to communicate REST. so how the heck can it do that if the socket is ready-only? :/
[18:35:03] <LordKalma> Another question, sorry, is there a way to *not* have to duplicate these variables? SQL_DATABASE and POSTGRES_DB: https://github.com/ruilvo/radioamadorismo-website/blob/feature-docker/dev.env
[18:35:37] <rawtaz> LordKalma: you cant modify the files that make use of the vars?
[18:35:48] <ada_> LordKalma: use YAML anchors https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#extension-fields
[18:36:22] <ada_> not really sure what you mean by "duplicate" but I'm assuming you have several services that use the same variables and you want to avoid repeating yourself
[18:36:31] <Tas-sos> this is the actually docker-composer file :
[18:36:31] <Tas-sos> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grnet/agora-sp/master/docker-compose.yml
[18:36:42] <LordKalma> ada_, I have two services that want the same data with two different variable names
[18:36:43] <rawtaz> Tas-sos: as you can see you already have a container running with that name app-backend, see the last line in https://pastebin.com/raw/P2pjn1gi . i think as ada_ said we need to see your complete compose files
[18:36:45] <ada_> so you could make an extension field containing those variables and re-use the extension field
[18:36:46] <LordKalma> thanks on the tip btw
[18:36:54] <ada_> LordKalma: yeah that is my assumption
[18:36:57] <LordKalma> rawtaz, yes, on one of them, but it would change the semantics
[18:37:14] <ada_> Tas-sos: yes, both compose files since I noticed you're using -f to extend a compose file with another one
[18:38:22] <ada_> oh wait
[18:38:40] <ada_> misread the command line - you're just using -f but not actually extending anytthing
[18:39:27] <ada_> yeah container db2ee7777 just exists
[18:39:29] <ada_> remove it
[18:39:36] <Tas-sos> yes yes sorry guys the other one is for Jenkins pipeline 
[18:40:08] <LordKalma> I tried the yaml equivalent of {"env_file": "dev.env", "environment": ["POSTGRES_DB":"${SQL_DATABASE}"]} but it complains that doesn't exist at that moment... 
[18:40:21] <ada_> LordKalma: you'd have to show me your yaml
[18:40:35] <Tas-sos> sorry sorry, this is the actully docker-compose file that I try to run now locally :
[18:40:38] <Tas-sos> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grnet/agora-sp/master/docker-compose.yml
[18:40:54] <LordKalma> ada_, feel free to explore at will: https://github.com/ruilvo/radioamadorismo-website/blob/feature-docker/docker-compose.dev.yaml
[18:40:54] <rawtaz> Tas-sos: you simply have to make the names unique - the names are based on the compose project name and the service names. so if you already have other containers with that name, you must change hte name on that or this one.
[18:41:15] <ada_> Tas-sos: yeah the error message says specifically "a container already exists with that name" and gives you teh container id
[18:41:22] <ada_> you can see from docker ps -a that container with that ID exists
[18:41:23] <ada_> delete it
[18:41:32] <ada_> and then you won't hit the error on "docker-compose up" anymore
[18:41:34] <rawtaz> LordKalma: FWIW here's about extension fields: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#extension-fields
[18:41:36] <LordKalma> I wanted to avoid repeating myself, but if I cana't do it, that's fine
[18:41:52] <Tas-sos> and with this command I specifically choose to run this one
[18:42:12] <LordKalma> interesting, thanks
[18:42:13] <ada_> LordKalma: what do you want this to look like instead?
[18:42:21] <ada_> LordKalma: I don't see a problem with extension fields in this yaml
[18:42:37] <LordKalma> ada_, the discussion started with me asking about now being redundant here: https://github.com/ruilvo/radioamadorismo-website/blob/feature-docker/dev.env
[18:42:39] <ada_> LordKalma: I do see that you have env-file set twice, to the same file;  is this what you're trying to refactor?
[18:42:50] <LordKalma> SQL_DATABASE == POSTGRES_DB and etc
[18:43:03] <ada_> ohhhh
[18:43:06] <Tas-sos> docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --project-name example1  up --build
[18:43:09] <Tas-sos> docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --project-name example2  up --build
[18:43:14] <LordKalma> might refactor it out anyway 
[18:43:16] <ada_> there's no real "elegant" way around that, since both containers have different vars
[18:43:24] <Tas-sos> ( sorry for confusing )
[18:43:32] <LordKalma> yeah, guess not, thanks, sorry for the confusion, ada_ 
[18:43:39] <ada_> no worries
[18:43:53] <ada_> Tas-sos: you can't have container_name set and ALSO use project names
[18:44:07] <ada_> iirc, container_name overrides what would be set by prefixing the project name to the container
[18:44:19] <ada_> so if you want to "up" the stack 2 times with different project names, take out your container_name: keyts
[18:44:24] <ada_> that way they will get prefixed correctly
[18:45:42] <Tas-sos> and this is the actually output when I run in the same time

[18:48:09] <rawtaz> Tas-sos: do you or do you not understand that the problem you are having is that you have a container already running with the same name that you are trying to start a new container?

[18:48:50] <Tas-sos> yes I understand fully the ERROR but I cannot understant the reason
[18:48:57] <Tas-sos> so.. Can I also define service name ?
[18:48:58] <ada_> because you have container_name set 
[18:49:01] <programmerq> Tas-sos just drop the container_name and access it by the service name.

[19:03:40] <rawtaz> ada_: you may be right. if it turns out that it doesnt work with :ro but without it, then it might be just a doc issue

[19:05:04] <devslash> I use Traefik and add a middleware rule for my web app so you visit mycoolwebapp.mydomain.com and if you arent authenticated, it will redirect you to the login page
[19:05:07] <devslash> no
[19:05:29] <ada_> rawtaz: I suppose the way I understand this is because it's a socket, there's no real way to prevent writing into it, you just aren't able to modify the socket "file" istelf?
[19:05:43] <ada_> so :ro doesn't prevent you from sending HTTP requests just from deleting or modifying the socket file itself?
[19:06:00] <tabakhase> rawtaz i scrolled and saw that message - hence the particular qustion what makes you even think its read-only cause "sockets" and ":ro" is not really a thing, obviously as you need to write to the socket to initiate any communication
[19:06:04] <rawtaz> ada_: oh. my. god. TIL.
[19:06:10] <ada_> yeah I never really thought about that either
[19:06:17] <rawtaz> tabakhase: yeah youre right. i didnt know that :(
[19:06:37] <rawtaz> that changes stuff. i have traefik running with the socket as :ro and would have this crony thing as well that way. hmm
[19:06:44] <tabakhase> rawtaz there are some "docker-socket-proxy" projects that actually filter - for using to let traefik read and such =)
[19:07:58] <rawtaz> so e.g. https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy, or do you knwo a better one?
[19:08:20] <rawtaz> devslash: you're sold then :-)
[19:08:41] <devslash> Yea. its easy enough to set up and add to existing web apps
[19:08:49] <devslash> and it has built in traefik support
[19:09:13] <rawtaz> tabakhase, ada_ do you guys know some best practice must read article or similar on the basic security measures one should take with docker? i mean, e.g. this proxy would be one such thing that people should know about. i have looked at the docker docs now and then but never caught this.
[19:09:38] <rawtaz> FWIW regarding traefik i think it only needs to read from the socket
[19:10:00] <rawtaz> devslash: sounds good. any idea if it's been audited for security or something like that?

[19:15:38] <ada_> it doesn't even make sense to be "read" only
[19:15:46] <ada_> because an HTTP GET to list containers is still a write to the socket
[19:15:59] <tabakhase> "read only socket" would be like UDP :P

[19:16:39] <rawtaz> ada_: in this context you are right. but in general terms, i dont see why one couldnt have a socket that's read-only and that a process just ingests data from when some other end writes to it

[19:17:34] <ada_> haven't busted those open in a LONG time
[19:17:49] <tabakhase> im not 1000% how it works in the back, but deal is basically that "you only need read to open the socket" - but actual writing does not happen into that file, but into a stream that the filesystem doesnt even know exists now - dont quote me on that tho...

[19:18:20] <LordKalma> sounds about right

[19:20:18] <rawtaz> in the case of using https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia#docker-labels-configurations for doing some cron-type work, i think the risk might be acceptable because the container isnt facing anything external, it just runs there all by itself. so it'd be quite some malware in that code for it to do something bad. but for e.g. traefik that faces the internet and has a looot of complexity, its a different matter, might be a good idea to use a socket proxy there.

[19:27:10] <lenswipe> That suggests to me that for some reason it can't find the exposed port on that relevant container
[19:27:20] <rawtaz> LordKalma: is that container actually having any listening ports inside it? you can inspect with docker inspect.
[19:27:31] <lenswipe> rawtaz, yeah, it listens on on port 80
[19:27:33] <LordKalma> uh?
[19:27:35] <rawtaz> you could either investigate, which id recomend, or you can force-set the port in the load balancer in traefik
[19:27:35] <lenswipe> that's not even the weirdest thing
[19:27:38] <LordKalma> ah
[19:27:41] <rawtaz> lenswipe: *
[19:28:00] <lenswipe> So, a couple of things here - one I have labels to set the port. That was working fine until I added a secret to the service definition. 
[19:28:04] <LordKalma> I have to learn traefik enventually to setup my django prod environment....
[19:28:09] <LordKalma> that's going to be fun... /s
[19:28:21] <lenswipe> Two, I attached to the traefik container and tried pinging the pihole container and got an IP that according to docker doesn't exist
[19:29:10] <lenswipe> rawtaz, "ping pihole" inside the traefik container gives me:  172.10.0.8
[19:29:39] <lenswipe> my traefik_net network is on the 172.10.42.0/16 network 
[19:29:47] <rawtaz> LordKalma: it's really pretty simple once you fiddled a bit, when the stuff starts falling into place you get most of it right away :) let me know if you need help
[19:29:55] <lenswipe> NONE of the hosts on that network have that IP.
[19:30:16] <lenswipe> LordKalma, same here (ironically) - I've kind of finagled my way around traefik enough now to know how to do most things. 
[19:30:35] <rawtaz> lenswipe: did you restart it all? :D

[19:30:37] <lenswipe> so to summarize, it looks like traefik is trying to proxy to an IP that doesn't exist (but responds to pings) and then complaining when it can't

[19:33:30] <rawtaz> that portainer thing, i have tried their online demo. it strikes me as a gui to docker-compose basically, it's very 1:1 it seems. that makes me think it's not worth having it, it adds complexity and if you start relying on it for daily tasks you depend on it when it breaks too, it just doesnt seem worth the gain?

[19:48:30] <programmerq> DogHackit: an env_var in the docker-compose.yaml won't get registry credentials. you'll still need to have them run the docker login or populate their ~/.docker/config.json with the credentials.
[19:48:41] <lenswipe> im wondering if i can define the network in the actual compose file for the traefik stack so I'm not farting around with docker network create blah blah blah
[19:49:02] <programmerq> lenswipe▸ you can 100% define networks in a compose file.
[19:49:13] <rawtaz> lenswipe: of course youll just down the services first
[19:49:31] <DogHackit> If this done once for each developer, would that be all they needed to configure?

[23:38:57] <lenswipe> rawtaz, it's the only way to get macvlan networks to work properly.
[23:39:40] <lenswipe> rawtaz, you have to create a config only network and then create another network that you use as the actual macvlan network
[23:39:58] <lenswipe> for reasons i don't understand, it doesn't work if you just straight up create a macvlan network and do it that way.
