[08:32:36] <digitok> in your example, the \b prevents it from dropping a digit to allow a match

[14:44:04] <Me-me> Oh I see. I have misread again.
[14:44:24] <digitok> gstaniak, will this work? https://regex101.com/r/JHxJYo/3
[14:44:28] <gstaniak> Me-me: but https://regex101.com/r/JHxJYo/2 matches the last word of the header from what I see? 
[14:44:32] <digitok> this matches spaces inside any []
[14:45:09] <digitok> well, technically not inside, but as long as the next ] doesn't have a [ before it
[14:45:17] <digitok> so usually inside
[14:45:43] <re101-swan-29> digitok this is what happens with (..)\1{9,}     https://regex101.com/r/uzuSiW/1
[14:46:21] <gstaniak> digitok: thanks, but if someone uses spaces in a field list value (as in https://regex101.com/r/vdgspy/1) it will match, it needs to be only within a section header
[14:46:33] <digitok> right, what language are you using?
[14:46:50] <digitok> re101-swan-29, should "DDDDDEEEEE" match?
[14:46:56] <gstaniak> digitok: me?
[14:47:01] <digitok> gstaniak, yes
[14:47:09] <gstaniak> digitok: python
[14:47:18] <digitok> bleh
[14:47:27] <digitok> can you use the "regex" module?
[14:47:31] <digitok> !py
[14:47:31] <perlbot> Please see https://pypi.org/project/regex/ for details on the 'regex' module with added functionality in Python.
[14:48:07] <digitok> oh, we can use a callback
[14:48:22] <digitok> do you know about those?
[14:48:22] <gstaniak> digitok: it will be difficult to do.. this is run remotely, adding a dependency means deploying a module to a lot of machines
[14:48:44] <digitok> right, a callback won't need that module
[14:48:54] <digitok> here's an example of a callback https://gist.github.com/mapkyca/65ca3f1adf6954bab11e
[14:49:47] <digitok> so you'd use this https://regex101.com/r/JHxJYo/4
[14:49:56] <digitok> and then in the callback you can simply match \s
[14:50:02] <gstaniak> digitok: thanks a lot, i will try that
[14:50:09] <digitok> (with another substitution)
[14:50:10] <digitok> yw
[14:50:36] <re101-swan-29> @dif
[14:51:33] <digitok> gstaniak, oops, slight edit https://regex101.com/r/JHxJYo/5
[14:51:50] <re101-swan-29> Basically what I am trying to do is find any combination of d/e consecutively ten times or more in a large text file. Is this possible in regex even or should I be using something else?
[14:52:49] <digitok> answering my question will help me understand what you mean by that
[14:53:08] <digitok> DDDDDDDDDD DDDDDEEEEE DEDEDEDEDE EDEDEDEDED
[14:53:11] <digitok> which of these should match
[14:53:29] <re101-swan-29> all of them, which is why I don't think it is possible on regex
[14:53:38] <digitok> of course it is
[14:54:17] <digitok> the link you posted does it
[14:54:21] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/wIr3qz/1
[14:54:35] <digitok> oh, sorry lol
[14:54:36] <digitok> one sec
[14:55:23] <re101-swan-29> Is there a way to make a regex for random combinations of D and E, like DEDEDEDEDEEEDDDEDE, DDDEEEDDEDEDEDDEDE, and DDEEDEDEDEEEDD
[14:55:33] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/wIr3qz/2
[14:55:38] <Me-me> [DE]{20,}
[14:55:53] <Me-me> If you want them to be equal in amount - that's significantly more complicated :D
[14:56:11] <digitok> luckily he doesn't
[14:57:14] <re101-swan-29> Thanks that is way more confusing then it looks lmao

[18:57:40] <digitok> oops
[18:58:32] <digitok> looks like it's not working correctly for 2 char tlds
[19:01:54] <digitok> the only thing i can suggest is limiting the extra tld to domains with 3 chars or less
[19:02:22] <digitok> but it'd still break on 3 char domains with 2 char tlds
[19:04:16] <digitok> i.e. it'd match correctly on "aaa.com.au", but not "subdomain.aaa.eu"
[19:04:48] <digitok> but it'd fix your "webmail.indra.es" example
[19:05:14] <digitok> the other option would be limiting the extra tld to specific tlds
[19:05:22] <digitok> like "com" or "co"
[19:05:44] <digitok> maybe that's better
[19:06:21] <digitok> actually, probably not, based on one of your previous links
[19:11:07] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/5JF048/11
