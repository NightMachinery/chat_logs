[13:16:05] <quesker> I was playing with nix and got a perl set up there, then tried installing cpanm.  but since I have env vars for either local::lib or brew (can't remember which) it installed in the wrong place even though it used the nix perl, I think
[13:16:41] <quesker> what is the correct way to use perl modules with nix?  or is it even worth the bother
[13:18:57] <buZz> one of the correct ways is knowing what you're doing :P
[13:19:34] <quesker> wasn't expecting that kind of answer on this channel, what is the world coming to
[13:20:40] <buZz> ;)
[13:20:57] <buZz> well you introduced two unknowns in your question
[13:21:30] <quesker> don't bother, I am putting you on ignore
[13:21:37] <buZz> eh ok?
[13:22:16] <Altreus> I think it's reasonable to suggest that you discover whether it is local::lib or perlbrew because perlbrew handles its own cpanm
[13:22:27] <buZz> clearly it isnt :D
[13:22:28] <buZz> rofl
[13:22:42] <Altreus> of course you could just use perlbrew and then you know you're using it :P
[13:22:48] <buZz> reproducible deployment doesnt need a human capable of knowing what they are using
[13:22:51] <buZz> :D :D
[13:24:13] <Pali> Hello! Do you know if there is some DSP module for Perl?
[13:24:44] <buZz> Pali: what do you mean? you can digital process any signal you want in any way you want
[13:25:13] <buZz> there's Audio::DSP but i think its ancient
[13:25:30] <Pali> something which contains implementation of common functions for digital signal processings, so .e.g. filters, parts of fft, etc...
[13:25:32] <buZz> https://metacpan.org/dist/Audio-DSP

[13:26:26] <Altreus> buZz: it friggin does cos I commissioned a website and I can't run the damn thing
[13:26:35] <Altreus> whose idea was it to put javascript on the server
[13:26:36] <buZz> 'run' a website?
[13:26:42] <buZz> ah, nodejs?
[13:26:46] <Altreus> yeah
[13:27:05] <Altreus> prepackaged software that doesn't Just Work :)
[13:27:09] <Altreus> actually to be fair
[13:27:15] <Altreus> I haven't tried running the prepackaged part
[13:27:29] <Altreus> I mean I have but I definitely did it wrong and then it was late
[13:27:36] <buZz> i like that nodejs meme
[13:27:37] <buZz> https://i.imgur.com/QlfAwZY.png
[13:27:39] <Pali> buZz: Audio-DSP looks like it depends on kernel's /dev/dsp interface... so it is not suitable
[13:27:57] <buZz> Pali: honestly, 99% of audio libraries on linux just translate back and forth
[13:28:12] <buZz> like pipewire implements full pulseaudio and jack 
[13:28:46] <Pali> I do not use any system audio playback/recording, so these parts would not help me
[13:28:48] <rindolf> Altreus: i use nodejs/npm for CLI tools (e.g: tsc). the seurity sucks there though :(
[13:28:50] <buZz> worstcase you could run it through 'aoss'

[13:30:00] <Pali> Math::FFT seems like a good starting point, but it seems it implements only FFT, which is for some cases overkill (e.g. when needed to extract only few frequences)
[13:30:37] <buZz> FFT overkill seems to apply mostly to pre-pentium1 systems :P
[13:31:02] <Pali> my primary focus was to implement v.23 modem...
[13:31:17] <Pali> ... which I have already done
[13:31:20] <Pali> it uses only two frequences
[13:31:24] <buZz> cool
[13:31:34] <buZz> iirc asterisk has some modem emulation internal aswell
[13:31:50] <buZz> at least a fax is emulated internally
[13:32:05] <Pali> yes! asterisk has lot of these parts, but it is a big project
[13:32:08] <Pali> and now I'm thinking if there is some perl module which could help to implement more stuffs

[17:10:51] <Altreus> good one al
[17:10:54] <Altreus> what's SWIG? :)
[17:11:47] <buZz> is SWIG the CPAN alternative for TurboPascal?
[17:11:59] <buZz> oh maybe > Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator
[17:12:27] <buZz> in general , perl isnt used -very- often for gui stuff
[17:14:38] <Altreus> what module do I use to mock out a method on an existing object?
[17:14:46] <Altreus> in a test
[17:15:02] <simcop2387> SWIG is a binding/interface generator to let you "easily" call into other languages.
[17:15:20] <Altreus> It might turn out to be easier just to replace the object but that's typing I don't wanna do

[17:21:10] <andrzejku> but finally I still have nothing hehe
[17:21:24] <andrzejku> especially perlapi is very hard to understand
[17:21:53] <simcop2387> the hardest part about doing any of that kind of thing is deciding how to turn a C api into one that makes sense in perl.  mostly since perl doesn't have a lot of the types that c apis need/use.

Since these aren't in RHELs repos, at least on some repos, and since some sysadmins don't like to use CPAN, I'd like to include them conditionally. I've seen this done, but I can't find good docs on it. Anyone got a link?

[22:36:57] <tirnanog> RoyK: one way is to use require, which occurs during runtime, though you would have to use eval to accomodate the exception that is thrown when not available.
[22:37:40] <tirnanog> another would be: use Module::Load::Conditional qw(can_load); my $has_data_validate = can_load(modules => { 'Data::Validate::IP' => undef, 'Data::Validate::Domain' => undef }, verbose => 0). that's a core module.
[22:38:31] <tirnanog> you'd also have to import the methods you want. for example, if ($has_data_validate) { Data::Validate::IP->import('is_ipv4'); }
[22:38:51] <tirnanog> (or use them by qualifying the package namespace)
