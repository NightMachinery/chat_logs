[02:15:28] <jmercouris> Violent characters

[02:31:05] <jmercouris> Yes that would be very surprising
[02:31:06] <Kabouik> I'm still on WEBKIT2-2.32 too because it hasn't been updated yet for my distribution, but that was already the case before I updated Nyxt and this issue didn'to ccur
[02:31:18] <jmercouris> Yes, I’m on that as well
[02:31:30] <jmercouris> I’ll have to go in front of my computer and see
[02:31:56] <Kabouik> You're onto updating Webkit for my distribution too? That's nice of you!
[02:32:18] <Kabouik> I have to open a task at their issue tracker actually, they asked me to but I didn't take the time

[02:53:31] <jmercouris> Back massage per chance?
[03:14:10] <defaultxr> hi. sorry if this is a noob question that has been asked before, but in chrome-based browsers you can typically do shift+esc to bring up a task manager that shows the memory usage of each open tab. is there an equivalent for nyxt? in htop i see that one of the webkit processes under nyxt is using a lot of memory; i want to be able to find out which one it is.

[03:20:36] <jmercouris> defaultxr: this does not exist now, you’d have to open an inspector for each tab
[03:20:53] <jmercouris> To see which one is doing it
[03:21:57] <defaultxr> ah okay, wasn't sure if it existed yet. thanks for the quick response.
[03:27:25] <Kabouik> Finally opened a task to Solus dev tracker for a webkit-gtk update
[03:28:38] <Kabouik> Back massage would be a fair reward for that significant effort
[03:29:27] <Kabouik> defaultxr this is something I'd like to because I often observe hungry webkit processes too

[03:32:58] <defaultxr> it would be very handy. i've been gradually getting into nyxt and i've been programming CL for a few years now, but unfortunately i don't think i'd know where to start when it comes to investigating how to implement something like this. not even sure if it would be information accessible via a javascript function call or C FFI or what.

[12:26:07] <Kabouik> It could be very well conflicting with my webkit-gtk 2.32.2 then jmercouris, but it started occurring with my recent Nyxt build, I was already on 2.32.2 before
