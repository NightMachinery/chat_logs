[00:03:15] <FromDiscord> <auxym> You need to create your nodes as `NodeRef` rather than `Node`
[00:04:23] <FromDiscord> <auxym> You can't create a ref to an existing value type
[00:10:17] <FromDiscord> <DMisener> Thanks.. I’ll give that as a try…  seems like a shame that such a conversion  or idiomatic scheme is not available.  Would you happen to know why?
[00:10:48] <FromDiscord> <DMisener> (edit) 04removed "as"
[00:33:10] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's simple memory allocation @DMisener Nodes are stack allocated so if you make a reference to them and they go out of scope you've now got either nil or pointers pointing at bad memory
[00:33:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> But if you use reference nodes, you now have heap allocated objects which are not reliant on the scope state to be valid

[00:37:04] <FromDiscord> <DMisener> Are all local var stored on the stack ... and is it safe to assume their lifetime will last until the exit of the proc stack frame??
[00:37:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> They have a point about function argument mutability↵(<@709044657232936960_=4eim=45venter=5b=49=52=43=5d>)
[00:38:02] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I think it's generally safe to assume all that
[00:39:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> They have some sort of point, but given strict funcs and what a mutable ref is i dont follow
[00:40:34] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> If you don't enable strict funcs ref argument can be either mutable or not
[00:40:46] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And strict funcs are experimental
[00:41:06] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So I'm pretty sure they don't know about it, and even if they do this still makes code unclear
[00:41:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The reference isnt mutable, what it points to is
[00:41:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Which is what i meant
[00:42:34] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Strict funcs turn this upside down anyway, but I guess that's how nim's version of constT vs const T looks like

[01:35:04] <FromDiscord> <auxym> If you're used to java/python/etc, everything there is a ref (or almost), so  you can use ref objects everywhere if you want to replicate this behavior.

[08:52:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> @impbox [ftsf]\: so looking into it now, it's indeed the nimvm that's the culprit it has a range defect when used in  emscripten and possibly 32bit(clearly i dont have this hardware to test this hypothesis, nor want to throw it in a VM)

[09:01:15] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Also you can build a nim debug program if you copy the flags that you were using for emscripten release/danger
