[00:35:24] <nx032> any fun/interesting onion sites?
[00:35:57] <nx032> last time i went on the wiki or whatever its called like ten yrs ago it was a bunch of dead links 
[00:36:12] <nx032> some 'forbidden' books library that had mostly junk
[00:39:22] <xx> it's best to not advertise the various onion sites

[01:54:00] <latenite> I have the same problem. I can not reach rt.com
[01:54:27] <latenite> It keeps showing me some DDOS advertisement, but not the real website.
[01:54:45] <latenite> I restated like 10 times now. What am I doing wrong here?
