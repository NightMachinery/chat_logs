[21:28:25] <NeoVoid[m]1> how to calculate the differnce
[21:28:26] <Tor[m]> Til capital sigma and capital pi are math symbols not greek uppercase letters
[21:28:50] <Tor[m]> NeoVoid[m]1: Bhai ye sab commerce wale karte hai 
[21:29:16] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: really?
[21:29:49] <Tor[m]> NeoVoid[m]1: I mean every science student knows this 
[21:30:05] <Tor[m]> It's discussed in class 11
[21:30:21] <Tor[m]> Commerce kids use it as kind of advertising material
[21:30:26] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: yes i am listening go on
[21:30:59] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: we had it in chartered Accounting Entrance
[21:31:13] <NeoVoid[m]1> logarithm right?
[21:31:19] <Tor[m]> NeoVoid[m]1: There's a CA among us 
[21:32:01] <Tor[m]> Tor[m]: Good way to show benefit of higher interest rate in long term
[21:32:06] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: I didnt pass the entrance. 
[21:32:06] <NeoVoid[m]1> thanks to science math portion lol
[21:32:19] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: ohh
[21:32:23] <Tor[m]> > <@telegram_989399820:t2bot.io> I didnt pass the entrance. 
[21:32:23] <Tor[m]> > thanks to science math portion lol
[21:32:23] <Tor[m]> Bruh 
[21:32:38] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: ya bruh
[21:32:51] <Tor[m]> So now what do you do ?
[21:33:05] <NeoVoid[m]1> I am not proud of myself eithet
[21:33:09] <NeoVoid[m]1> s/eithet/either/
[21:33:20] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: in what context
[21:33:34] <Tor[m]> As primary job ?
[21:33:56] <NeoVoid[m]1> just finished grad last year
[21:34:05] <Tor[m]> In
[21:34:36] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: bachelors of commerce
[21:35:01] <Tor[m]> Not doing acca ?
[21:35:05] <NeoVoid[m]1> Now I am thinking to try MCA
[21:35:19] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: whats that?
[21:35:20] <Tor[m]> Computer application ?
[21:35:28] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: yep
[21:35:36] <Tor[m]> NeoVoid[m]1: Kya baat kar raha hai 
[21:35:39] <Tor[m]> Nahi pata ?
[21:36:00] <NeoVoid[m]1> short form se to nahi guess ho rha
[21:36:04] <Tor[m]> https://www.accaglobal.com/in/en.html
[21:36:41] <Tor[m]> My friends who thoight ca was difficult did this
[21:37:05] <Tor[m]> I have like 40+ people doing ca
[21:37:11] <Tor[m]> Or are ca
[21:37:16] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: ohh gotta consider this
[21:38:00] <Tor[m]> NeoVoid[m]1: Do certs instead 
[21:38:15] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: wait this is after becoming CA?
[21:38:25] <Tor[m]> NeoVoid[m]1:  No
[21:38:33] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: which certs?
[21:39:05] <NeoVoid[m]1> Tor[m]: ohh right charted certified accountant
[21:41:43] <Tor[m]> https://collegedunia.com/courses/association-of-chartered-certified-accountants-acca
[22:17:26] <NeoVoid[m]1> <Tor[m]> "Do certs instead..." <- why certs are better than PG?
[22:23:20] <Tor[m]> You have to shift ?
[22:23:38] <Tor[m]> I hope you do it from NIT's
[22:36:45] <NeoVoid[m]> i didnt get it
[22:50:11] <Zbnssn[m]> <NeoVoid[m]1> "image.jpeg" <- reads James Clear once
[22:51:23] <Zbnssn[m]> <NeoVoid[m]1> "why certs are better than PG?" <- you can put them on your linkedin profile?
[22:52:01] <Zbnssn[m]> <gtlsgamr> "ASKPASS is a different program" <- I did it now succeeded without installing a separate program
[22:53:33] <Zbnssn[m]> I did a hacky way of going in /etc/sudoers
[22:53:33] <Zbnssn[m]>  user ALL=(ALL) NO PASSWD: /bin/systemctl start bluetooth
[22:54:27] <Zbnssn[m]> but wasnt proud of it because If I had another script that used sudo and I executed it via dmenu it'd just fill up my sudoers file
[22:54:27] <Zbnssn[m]> also not v portable because it sits in root directory
[22:54:48] <Zbnssn[m]> now I did it so happy :DD
[22:56:06] <Zbnssn[m]> firstly you need to make a dpass script to show up to take in sudo password and then output that to sudo
[22:56:06] <Zbnssn[m]> #!/bin/sh
[22:56:26] <Zbnssn[m]> dmenu -P -p "$1" <&-
[22:57:08] <Zbnssn[m]> and then in ur .bashrc set it as export it as SUDO_ASKPASS
[22:57:08] <Zbnssn[m]> export SUDO_ASKPASS=/home/saumit/.scripts/dpass
[22:57:15] <Zbnssn[m]> that's it
[22:58:15] <Zbnssn[m]> now I just have to use -A flag when entering a sudo using command in a script and it will lead to a nice hiddenpass dmenu prompt
[23:06:11] <Tor[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "i didnt get it" <- If you are doing mca do it with nit 
[23:07:12] <Tor[m]> Mca are ~ btech and NIT's are visited by good tech company so if you get it you can get a good job if you are  doing it
[23:07:18] <Tor[m]> And also try doing acca
[23:07:42] <Tor[m]> Finance and it you can get good money
[23:15:00] <Zbnssn[m]> certs are good to put on your linkedin profile or resume ?
[23:15:05] <Zbnssn[m]> https://0x0.st/oXOZ.mp4
[23:53:08] <theo[m]> <Zbnssn[m]> "https://0x0.st/oXOZ.mp4" <- noice!
[23:53:08] <theo[m]> btw, you could use dmenu or fzf for choosing the mac address instead of hardcoding it, but anyway
[23:53:08] <theo[m]> looks cool though
[23:54:12] <theo[m]> <Zbnssn[m]> "https://0x0.st/oXOZ.mp4" <- and thanks for the askpass thing
[23:54:12] <theo[m]> never knew such a thing existed lol
[23:54:12] <theo[m]> i just use doas with nopass on, so
