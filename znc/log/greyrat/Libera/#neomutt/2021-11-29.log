[15:00:50] <flatcap> morning all
[15:01:00] <ckardaris> hello flatcap
[15:05:42] <flatcap> hi ckardaris 
[15:13:03] <ckardaris> flatcap: I've been meaning to ask you. I have not done a lot of progress on the IPC implementation, but currently I am stuck with an issue. So I define lots of struct ListHeads. I then do (struct ListHead)STAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER(head) on all of them. I populate some of them by doing mutt_list_insert_tail(&head, mutt_str_dup(str)). After finishing I want to free stuff. I have been trying to do
[15:13:04] <ckardaris> mutt_list_free(&head). But I get a SIGSEGV error on the lists that are populated. The others seem to be handled correctly (empty and all). Any idea about what I am doing wrong? 
[15:16:23] <flatcap> hmm... dunno.  that sounds ok.
[15:16:46] <flatcap> (I just checked that list_free() isn't freeing the list head, itself
[15:16:49] <flatcap> )
[15:17:14] <flatcap> can you push the code
[15:18:04] <ckardaris> I would prefer it that way anyways. I believe it crashes when it tries to free the string that was str_dup'ed
[15:19:46] <flatcap> our (s)tailq helper functions aren't quite consistent...
[15:20:25] <flatcap> some free the head object, some don't.  there are a few _free() vs _clear() functions in these cases
[15:20:55] *** Quits: elric1 (~elric@shalod.imrryr.org) (Quit: leaving)
[15:20:55] <flatcap> so if you feel like a refactoring challenge ;-)
[15:21:39] <flatcap> "Temporary commit" :-)
[15:22:44] <ckardaris> haha yes. It's a mess. I have been trying to do some changes
[15:23:09] <ckardaris> let me send you the client as well
[15:24:16] <flatcap> hmm... all those warnings play hell with -Werror
[15:24:40] <ckardaris> https://gist.github.com/ckardaris/858edce8ddf48efc9b73a459f840d39e
[15:25:17] <ckardaris> It's a WIP :P Some regression was needed to have a better functionality
[15:25:25] <flatcap> oh yes, the double-spaced code.  I remember
[15:25:37] <ckardaris> I don't know why pasting inserts spaces
[15:26:24] <ckardaris> Anyway if it compiles it should crash with a simple ./neomutt-msg test
[15:26:29] <flatcap> looks like a CR vs CRLF issue
[15:26:36] <flatcap> cool
[15:27:40] <flatcap> neomutt doesn't compile, but I can't push to your repo
[15:28:10] <flatcap> (I suggest devs use branches on the neomutt repo to make review, etc, easier)
[15:28:31] <ckardaris> Yes I will do that
[15:29:20] <ckardaris> weird, it compiles for me
[15:29:22] <flatcap> thanks
[15:29:48] <flatcap> gcc 11.2.1 complains ipc.c:105:11: error: expected expression

[15:38:32] <flatcap> use the remote git@github.com:neomutt/neomutt.git
[15:39:25] <flatcap> git remote set-url github git@github.com:neomutt/neomutt.git

[15:40:53] <ckardaris> no worries I fixed it
[15:41:15] <flatcap> that means you can clone https:// but git'll use git@ automatically when pushing
[15:41:16] <ckardaris> i changed the url for my upstream remote
[15:41:31] <flatcap> got it
[15:42:55] <ckardaris> I should also add [no ci] in commits pushed to the org from now on

[16:52:25] <flatcap> because you weren't including the prototypes for mutt_str_dup(), the compiler assumed an int retval

[18:28:53] <immae> Hello! Is there a way to reply to an e-mail and keep some of the headers of the e-mail in the response? (I’m fine with an undefined behavior for, say, answering to multiple e-mails, which won’t happen in my situation)
[18:41:01] *** fstab_ is now known as fstab
[18:45:57] <flatcap> hmm... it seems that replying strips them.  however forwarding seems to honour "unignore NAME"
[18:49:24] <immae> It’s a decent default behavior :)
[18:49:47] <gahr> hi
[18:51:16] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[18:51:41] <flatcap> immae:yeah, as long as you don't have to do it often :-)
[18:53:10] <flatcap> gahr: I've been messing around with the fuzzing, over the weekend.  I now have a reasonable idea of how it fits together...
[18:53:14] <immae> Yes it’s quite rare thankfully :)
[18:53:33] <flatcap> (I'll doc the process when I get a sec)
[18:54:19] <flatcap> currently we only fuzz: mutt_rfc822_read_header() and mutt_parse_part()
[18:55:13] <flatcap> are there any other functions (or areas of the code), that spring to mind, that we might fuzz too?
[18:57:27] <gahr> flatcap: ah nice, I've seen some commits and a PR related to it
[18:58:53] <flatcap> the PR will mean we get fuzzing pre-emptively on all PRs
[18:59:10] <flatcap> except that it's already found and error that I don't understand
[18:59:35] <immae> flatcap: would you accept a PR that permits to keep some header when replying to an e-mail? (if so, what would you prefer as configuration name? reply_keep_headers ?)
[19:00:12] <gahr> I didn't get that error, too
[19:00:57] <flatcap> some of the docs describe the memory sanitizer as experimental (I don't know if that's still the case)
[19:01:25] <gahr> mutt_addrlist_parse <-- perhaps we could fuzzy parsing addresses?
[19:01:25] <flatcap> immae: hmm... that behaviour sounds a bit strange to me.  which headers do you want to keep?
[19:01:32] <gahr> or is that included in mutt_rfc822_read_header>
[19:02:02] <flatcap> not sure, mutt_rfc822_read_header() is a the tip of a huge network of function calls!
[19:02:10] <gahr> yeah
[19:02:31] *** Joins: lemontree (~chat@user/lemontree)
[19:02:40] <gahr> I'm totally illiterate about fuzzing
[19:02:47] <gahr> how structured the random bytes are?
[19:02:53] <immae> flatcap: I’m using a messaging client called DeltaChat, which relies on e-mail to relay the instant messages. And I want to "implement" the protocol so that my e-mails are well-formed when I answer with mutt, and that consists in correctly transferring the `Chat-*` headers in the reply
[19:03:06] <immae> (https://delta.chat/)
[19:04:32] <flatcap> gahr: (ignore the colours) https://flatcap.org/mutt/email.svg
[19:05:16] <flatcap> immae: oh, interesting

[19:06:28] <flatcap> gahr: it's something to do with profiling the code...
[19:07:10] <flatcap> e.g. you give the fuzzer a valid input, it runs the code and records the paths/functions that are run
[19:07:38] <flatcap> the fuzzer tweaks the input: changes/adds/removes a letter, and reruns the test
[19:08:04] <flatcap> if that takes a different path through the code, the test is preserved (and will go on to have children)
[19:08:54] <flatcap> the fuzzer keeps randomising the inputs to try to cover as much code as possible (in a random undirected way)
[19:11:14] <flatcap> we started with a "corpus" of sane email headers, plus a dictionary of keywords and it does the rest
[19:11:33] <flatcap> (and google pick up the tab for all the cpu cycles :-)
[19:11:59] <gahr> oh I see
[19:12:01] <flatcap> I have no idea how often, or for how long it's run.  I think at least daily
[19:12:13] <gahr> nice

[19:13:09] <flatcap> the entry point is in fuzz/address.c and we can create as many separate tests as we like
[19:14:16] <flatcap> immae: would you ever want to see the headers?
[19:15:10] <immae> I don’t mind, but clearly there are headers I see that I don’t want to have inserted by default in the reply (if you wanted to reuse unignore :p ), like "X-Spam-Status" :p
[19:15:19] <flatcap> :-)
[19:16:21] <flatcap> so you'd want something like ignore/unignore -- a list of headers to preserve
[19:17:13] <flatcap> are there circumstances when replying that you DON'T want the header?
[19:17:14] <immae> I don’t have a strong opinion on that, except that what I want to see is distinct from what I want in the replied e-mail
[19:17:26] <immae> Currently no

[19:18:19] <immae> Maybe my use case is too specific :)
[19:20:48] <immae> note that To, Cc, From, Subject are currently such kind of headers, except that they get a special treatment (From becomes To and vice versa, Subject gets a Re inserted, etc.)

[19:30:28] <flatcap> you'll need code for two commands to maintain the list (of one item :-)
[19:30:58] <flatcap> you'll need to alter the header parsing and create somewhere to store the result in struct Envelope
[19:31:18] <flatcap> you could possibly use struct ListHead userhdrs
[19:31:49] <flatcap> then you'd need to alter copy_message() for the SEND_REPLY case to transfer the headers
[19:32:07] <flatcap> could be quite a bit of work
[19:32:18] <immae> ok
[19:32:18] <flatcap> how popular is delta-chat?
[19:32:26] <immae> I have no idea :)
[19:32:27] <flatcap> how to they suggest using email?
[19:32:47] <immae> They don’t
[19:33:06] <immae> They do extra work to "guess" when an unknown MUA did something
[19:33:29] <immae> (sometimes it breaks threads)
[19:33:44] <immae> Thanks for the hint anyway, I’ll see what I manage to do :)
[19:34:37] <flatcap> ok
[20:11:31] <DebXWoody> ... hmmm,... Use E-Mail for E-Mail and XMPP for instant messages :)
[20:11:49] <flatcap> :-)
[20:20:31] <DebXWoody> There is a good post in german from kirchwitz netiquette. It's not the same, but some part is also in rfc1855. E-Mail is (an I think) should not instant. This are different use cases.
