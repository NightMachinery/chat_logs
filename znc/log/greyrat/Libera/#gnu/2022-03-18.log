[02:13:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> also colaboration with dark.fi
[02:14:20] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> do you agree that current copyleft compatible  business models are not really sustainable?
[02:14:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> as for BSD yes, a alternative to linux kernel is badly needed
[02:15:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hurd is not an option yet sadly is still a research project
[02:16:24] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> openBSD is the most minimal curently
[02:16:46] <yrk> M3RELATIVISM[m]: I would agree that a model which preserves freedom, but supports the devepment of free software is surely needed. I haven't heard of a model which really nails it yet though
[02:16:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hyperbk the kernel of HyperbolaBSD effort is inspired in OBSD
[02:17:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I believe I have the solution
[02:17:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> licensing should be involved though
[02:17:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so that is why I propoused a GPLv4

[02:20:14] <yrk> M3RELATIVISM[m]: "current system", is the software market in general, or the free software market?
[02:20:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no the whole economic system as a whole

[02:30:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ok so great
[02:31:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> there is imense power in value creation
[02:31:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if done right you can creat a totally self-sustaing system
[02:32:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I like to call it self-sustaining collectives or Autonomous Kolectiva
[02:32:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> why is such power of value creation usefull for this movement you may ask?

[02:37:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> a horizontal cooperative model where power is not concentrated, where developers and other fellows get rewarded for they contributions is needed
[02:37:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sure > dark.fi/manifesto.html
[02:38:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and specifically https://libregit.org/GVRN/GVRNspec/src/branch/master/ABOUT.md
[02:39:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> basically you would create a system where: "a system of solidarity where groups would join and get together in some bigger structure” collaborative fragmentation
[02:40:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> this bigger structure would be icentivized and stabelized through a license

[02:41:37] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so this power that central banks use to create value based on credit(aka from latin to believe), remember money is debt now a days and debt=credit, could be used on a selfsustain collectivized system

[02:48:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has you can see under this system developers would be rewarded for their work and avoid the current problem where people choose the only available implementation even if that breaks original ideal(linuxkernelOSS, systemdNONUNIX, etc)
[02:48:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> this model is also compatible with current donation model, therefore wouldnt deter adoption in the begining
[02:50:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> licensing is important here given you would inforce value creation of a single project benefit all the upstream value/shares as well given you relly on their work as well

[16:40:25] <anton> good morning GNU, happy hacking!
[16:40:33] <tesseract> it looks like trisquel forum is dead
[16:40:38] <epony> cranking licenses, like a mini dictator handling a couple of hashes and waivering propaganda pamphlets in the air
[16:40:41] <tesseract> https://trisquel.info/en/forum
[16:40:59] <tesseract> it doesn't show any messages
[16:41:01] <epony> tesseract, hmm what software does it run?
[16:41:08] <tesseract> dunno
[16:41:21] <epony> is it freeEEE?
[16:41:25] <epony> e?
[16:41:31] <tesseract> yes
[16:41:41] <tesseract> i think so. it is trisquel after all
[16:42:39] <anton> Trisquel GNU/Linux is 100% free software
[16:43:48] <epony> it's a leased hosting server in OVH running some web software which you do not know until you have a list of the software stack elements in the output
[16:46:07] <epony> the web site might be running something totally unclean which is unrelated to the OS "free" status (which contains non-free packages running on it)
[16:46:23] <epony> so your definition of free falls into the unknown charter
[16:46:24] <anton> It's "web software" is just Apache/2 on Trisquel GNU/Linux
[16:46:34] <anton> which is what I expected it to be
[16:46:35] <epony> Apache is OSI
[16:47:12] <epony> you're unaware how dynamic web pages are running and what forum software is
[16:47:24] <anton> no
[16:48:03] <epony> it includes an interpreter language, database, file storage, content media formats, and forum software which comes from people who are not running free software themselves
[16:48:31] <epony> all of that web stack is not compatible with your idealist view on "free software"

[16:49:35] <epony> and the forum seems locked ;-) so no free entry even

[17:10:51] <epony> it's what RMS uses at the end of his interaction as "greetings and bye bye" (best wishes) to conclude his video chats
[17:10:57] <epony> (and posts)
[17:11:57] <epony> that's basically the idea of the free software song, to explain about collaborative software work and benefits of that, known as "hacking" (the intellectual work at software improvement)
[17:12:21] <bittin> anyone else attending Libreplanet this weekend?
[17:12:34] <epony> it's more than just a "greeting" ;-) it's a call to software work and friendship around it
[17:12:50] <epony> bittin, got a page about it?
[17:13:04] <epony> share the link so people find out more info..
[17:13:05] <bittin> epony, https://libreplanet.org/2022/ 
[17:13:35] <bittin> its essentially FSFs yearly conference, thats Online for the second or third time this weekend
[17:13:45] <epony> cool (always use the chance to inform bystanders what you're talking about, so they quickly tune to your airwaves)
[17:13:55] <epony> excellent news
[17:15:28] <epony> I like software conferences with video presentations, that's a superb way to provide updates and engage people who don't have the money and options to attend in person
[17:15:40] <epony> have to check it out then!
[17:15:54] <epony> good you're mentioning it
[17:16:12] <bittin> no problem
[17:16:30] <bittin> was in USA, but now it been online past 2-3 years due to COVID
[17:16:37] <epony> ye ye
[17:17:31] <epony> it was high time the conferences had online variants too happening with the live events (happenings should be shared and experienced on the Internet too, that's why it's live and interactive)

[23:08:20] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> tesseract: my opinion on that would be
[23:08:51] <tesseract> so, invidious is unethical
[23:09:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by doing a frontend you are supporting such system and wasting time and energy on something outside your control instead of working on a real alternative, sometimes such is necessary unfortunately given the fact that it is a monopoly
[23:09:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> therefore I dont believe invidious is unethical, just that not all eggs should be put into that
[23:10:24] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given it doesnt provide a real alternative and also could be targeted by google easely
[23:10:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> like it is already happening with facebook actions on bibliogram a instagram frontend
[23:10:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> very similar to invidious ;X
