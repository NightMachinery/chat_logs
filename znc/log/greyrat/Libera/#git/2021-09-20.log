[01:35:27] <OMGOMG> no one ever reads that
[01:35:30] <nedbat> https://gitirc.eu/ says "it's okay to talk about anything (within general limits of reason), as long as you don't get in the way of people talking about on-topic things (mainly questions about git and using git)" so github is ok to talk about.
[01:35:44] <mackerman> I don't think a topic is necesary.  GitHub and GitLab already have obivous channels on this network already.
[01:35:59] <mackerman> And there is this trigger:  !github_vs_git
[01:35:59] <gitinfo> github.com is not git; it's a hosting platform for git. There are alternative hosting offers (you can even host repositories yourself, or work on something on your own without any hosting whatsoever), and the range of features on the corresponding websites may differ. Git has little influence on what happens in github's web interface.

[03:16:23] <lantech19446> I've been working on a website for the last several days and i want to load it onto a server but i'm unsure if the original copy has been changed from the copy i have in my github repo. Is there a way to load my changes and maintain the changes that may have been made directly to the site in the meantime?
[03:19:03] *** Joins: dsrt^ (~dsrt@12.203.127.82)
[03:19:19] <lantech19446> I guess if i pushed the original copy to github it's only going to push those changes since the last commit and my changes would persist right? and then I could pull to update the site with my changes
[03:22:24] <cbreak> lantech19446: why would the original copy change?
[03:22:40] <cbreak> git doesn't track changes, it tracks state
[03:22:57] <lantech19446> it may have changed if my boss made changes to the site
[03:22:58] <cbreak> if you want to compare state, make a new branch, commit the potentially-modified-current-state, and use git diff
[03:23:08] <cbreak> without going through the repo? what a noob

[03:37:24] <cbreak> no pushing
[03:37:30] <cbreak> all you do is purely local
[03:37:32] <lantech19446> cbreak: ok I didn't realize checkout was how you dictate a branch so git checkout -b new?
[03:37:44] <cbreak> you can create branches in different ways
[03:37:54] <lantech19446> oo ok I created a new branch on github lol
[03:37:54] <cbreak> git checkout -b newname branchpoint
[03:38:24] <cbreak> you'd branch off of where you think it should be
[03:38:35] *** Quits: jonosterman (~Rheanna@101.91.180.110) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:38:42] <cbreak> git checkout -b will create a new branch, and check it out at the same time
[03:38:57] <cbreak> then you replace all the files with those that are actually on the server
[03:38:59] <lantech19446> and it'll do the entire repo
[03:39:14] <cbreak> then you commit this
[03:39:35] <cbreak> and after committing, you can use git to look at history, for example with git show
[03:39:57] <cbreak> if committing doesn't work with an error about "empty commit", then no change was made
[03:40:23] <lantech19446> i'm sorry i feel like i'm being really dense right now and it's not intentional so i'm doing git checkout how am i comparing that to what's on github?
[03:40:40] <cbreak> that's further down the line
[03:40:43] <cbreak> git works on history
[03:40:54] <cbreak> so what I recommend is to make the state on the server new history
[03:41:01] <cbreak> for this purpose, a new branch is created
[03:41:06] <lantech19446> ok so this is just going to tell me if he changed the site at all since the last commit
[03:41:17] <cbreak> and then, you transfer the state on the server into your repo, with rsync, or how ever you do it
[03:41:25] <cbreak> it will tell you much more
[03:41:31] <cbreak> it'll tell you exactly how it changed
[03:41:41] <cbreak> and it'll give you the ability to merge those changes with what ever you wish
[03:42:56] <lantech19446> ok so i made the new branch locally it said it switched to the new branch but when i do git status it says nothing to commit
[03:43:27] <cbreak> of course not
[03:43:33] <cbreak> what would there be to commit?
[03:43:56] <cbreak> you first have to transfer the current state that is on the server into your repo
[03:44:00] <lantech19446> you said to do a commit so i expected there to be files waiting like an initial commit

[03:58:26] <cbreak> git has nothing to do with web servers
[03:59:02] <lantech19446> so git can't add the files to a git repo?

[04:04:51] <cbreak> but if you have that, you can just git diff / git status
[04:05:09] <lantech19446> so i don't actually need the new branch?
[04:05:20] <cbreak> you need it if there are changes, and  you want to merge them
[04:05:30] <lantech19446> ok
[04:05:30] <cbreak> but just to check them out, you can do the normal git things

[04:06:41] <lantech19446> ok i switched back to master and ran git status and it says nothing to commit
[04:06:57] <lantech19446> it's hard to believe he hasn't done anything on the site in 17 days
[04:07:19] <cbreak> nothing has happened in this particular repo.
[04:07:35] <cbreak> it might have happened outside of this git repo
[04:07:51] <cbreak> but that's not a git problem, you'd have to transfer the changes back into git
[04:08:01] <lantech19446> no the repo is the actual working directory it's on /var/www/site for that reason
[04:08:26] <lantech19446> so even if he coded it on his computer he'd have to update the file within the repo to change the site
[04:08:34] <cbreak> then you'll have to believe git status
[04:08:50] <lantech19446> ok it hasn't steered me wrong yet lol
[04:09:05] <cbreak> git status will tell you about uncommitted changes
[04:09:08] <cbreak> maybe they were committed?
[04:09:12] <cbreak> git log will tell you that.

[05:54:02] <Linkandzelda> hi, is it ok to put a git repo into a synced folder when you don't plan to do any edits on multiple machines (no sync conflicts)?
[05:57:19] <madduck> Linkandzelda: I'd exclude .git from the sync

[05:58:53] <Linkandzelda> madduck: wouldnt that cause more problems?
[05:59:13] <madduck> I have no idea what you are trying to do so I cannot answer that question.
[05:59:19] <madduck> Sounds like you don't need .git on other machines, so…
[05:59:55] <madduck> the way I usually do this is by defining a hook that employs rsync to maintain a clean checkout, which is then sync'd to other machines.

[06:02:35] *** Quits: ChmEarl (~chmearl@user/chmearl) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:02:58] <Linkandzelda> I suppose my "problem" is that on my machines my whole Projects folder is synced. I want to put git repos in there, and I want the local state to be synced across those machines. Including the current branch, status, etc. Instead of having to ignore every git repo in the nest and remember to ignore all future ones
[06:03:26] *** Joins: Samian (~Sami@user/samian)
[06:03:40] <madduck> it does not sound like a smart idea to me, but YMMV
[06:03:45] <madduck> just try it.
[06:04:18] <Linkandzelda> Those machines won't be used at the same time, so I don't see why it would create issues. Just people advise "dont do it" and cant find true reasons why not
[06:05:08] <madduck> .git is not designed for concurrent access. So yeah, if you never use the two machines at the same time, it might well work.
[06:05:33] <madduck> But here be dragons if ever there was a concurrent access, e.g. if the sync got delayed until after you started working on the next machine.
[06:05:36] <madduck> good luck\
[06:05:42] <madduck> are you using syncthing?

[15:39:37] <aram> can I use borrowed objects and/or git-replave to create this kind of repo:
[15:39:37] <aram> 1. the new repo is conceptually a clone of another repo with a large history.
[15:39:37] <aram> 2. when people clone the new repo, they only download a small amount of data.
[15:39:38] <aram> 3. yet the whole history is available on demand, either automatically (ideally), or by the user having to do something.
[15:39:42] <aram> 4. this repository has to act as the new upstream, so it can't be a shallow clone (at least I don't think so?)
[15:39:45] <aram> 5. there are cross interactions between the old and the new repo.

[17:10:59] <roxlu> Ok. I'm working on a project with a team and personally I would find it cleaner to put all related changes in one branch, especially when one suspects minor changes to happen). I'm sure this happens more often: you create a feature branch, merge it and then need to fix minor things. Wouldn't it be nicer to have all updates in once branch?
[17:11:09] <roxlu> s/once/one.
[17:11:34] <roxlu> what if I checkout the feature branch, make some changes and push again?
[17:11:58] <mort> ideally, you create a feature branch, you test it, other people review it, and when it's good, you merge it
[17:13:30] <roxlu> yeah totally agree; but there will be situations where other things get more prio. e.g. I was testing this feature on a different os/hardware then production uses. Because I had to wait for the same hardware to arrive and others needed my changes we've merged the feature branch already

[17:55:10] <teut69> each line of the tip *
[17:56:37] <teut69> cases can be both commits changed line number  for example 37  ,  or only one commit touched line 37 , or none did
[17:57:23] <teut69> to my understanding  the first intance should cause conflicts
[17:57:44] <teut69> afk for few minutes , if uts right plz say yes
[17:57:48] <teut69> its*

[20:05:10] <canton7> (people think about a branch as being a series of commits leading up to a branch label, but that's not formally defined. Technically, a commit can be considered a part of every branch which it's reachable from, but that means that the commits in the branch can be considered both part of master and the branch once the branch has been merged in...
[20:05:10] <canton7> Which isn't a useful definition. Then you start dreaming up better definitions which have more to do with workflow, which are useful but not part of git's data model)

[23:25:34] <smacko> Hi - got a question that I can't seem to find the answer on. Assuming I have a file that's already part of a repository. If I ran git commit -m "foo" foo.txt at the exact same time as something was written to that file is it possible that the commit would contain a incomplete set of changes?

[23:28:51] *** Joins: ZacSharp (~ZacSharp@user/zacsharp)
[23:32:21] <mackerman> smacko: Maybe. It is possible that the file will have old or new contents or some of each, depending on how exactly the I/Os are timed.
[23:33:22] <smacko> Ok that's what I thought.
[23:33:23] <mackerman> Also depends on if the write is to the same file, or a new file moved into place.  The latter is common in editors and file copy.
[23:33:26] <mackerman> So don't do that.
[23:33:59] <smacko> It seems it would be very hard to provide some sort of consistency with i/o

[23:35:30] <mackerman> Advisory flocks from both writers. But those are optional both have to respect them.
[23:36:27] <smacko> Is that advisory flock dependent on the filesystem type too, right?
