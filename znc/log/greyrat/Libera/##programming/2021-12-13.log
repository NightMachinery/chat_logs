[01:25:18] <decker> https://github.com/d3x0r/SACK/blob/master/src/configlib/configscript.c#L49-L160  this merges everything in one - it contains the token type for matching string content; wish I could share this other header, this company has a much bigger message structure with 100's of messages, each message is itself a type, and the unions are huge lists of the externally defined strctures

[01:25:42] <decker> the latter is better if you have that many things; I can't say that a atomic-like union declaration hasn't been confusing.
[01:26:36] <decker> but there's more ditance between things you're required to update in the case that every content of union has its own struct declaration

[01:41:54] <decker> one issue with a tagged union then, is that its smallest size is the largest message type.  So while ya know 95% of the messages are like {value1:1,value2:2} there's few that are like daily_schedule_of_games[sessions][games][patterns and pattern data+payouts per level per game]
[01:42:26] <decker> or - you end up with some sort of custom allocator that allocates a message type and only the extra information it needs
[01:42:44] <decker> on the receiving side it's harmless, because you're just applying a structure to a message.

[01:43:45] <decker> BTW  - a lng time ago someone I worked with was working on updating a protocol in the game machines, and found the whole thing really unruly - and wanted to come up with some generic method to specify a message's content like "%i%i%b%f" I dunnno 2 int's a byte and a float?  ... 
[01:44:25] <decker> I've seen lots of ways that poeple have approached making composable types; and even XML which is supposed to be self descriptive isn't, and only understands strings.
[01:45:20] <decker> JSON was a good step in the right direction; that in languages the token itself defines it's type.  123 being different from "123"; so now you almost have a notion of the basic types programs work with - numbers (in various precisions) and strings (of various lengths)
[01:46:27] <decker> just needs a date format, which while a little ugly iso-8601 fits in as an extenion of Number[int/float/prefixed radix/date] with a couple extra characters accepted to switch resulting type
[01:46:38] <nomagno> decker: then you have me, who uses a string-only subset of JSON for transmission of packets
[01:46:44] <nomagno> :^P
[01:47:38] <nomagno> I could probably use something... well, better. I'll see if I can get rid of the burden of a TOML and JSON parser as dependencies

[01:50:30] <decker> ala xml schema

[01:50:58] <flakland> to check for errors, if number is out of int bounds
[01:51:01] <flakland> etc.
[01:51:08] <nomagno> So, instead of {AMESS{OF}{"WEIRD"{1}}BRACKERS}, 'AMESS\n\tOF\n\"tWEIRD"\n\tBRACKERS\n'
[01:51:25] <nomagno> ASCII-encoded spaces, newlines, and tabs as separators
[01:51:57] <nomagno> I can actually get rid of both the JSON and the TOML dependency with this. Which means I was making a dumb usage of it anyways

[08:58:11] <beaky> it feels more smooth and the smaller frametimes reduce input latency
[08:58:23] <ent58> you sure about that arahael? heh
[08:58:24] <arahael> So it's about the input latency and not the refresh rate?
[08:58:29] <arahael> ent58: Quite sure.
[08:58:34] <ent58> yeah input latency is more important
[08:58:51] <beaky> the human eye can track that fast it really does feel much more smooth to me esp. when scrolling

[08:59:59] <ent58> I've seen the difference between 60 and 144hz displays, and I assure you that old myth about 60fps (or hz) is not a thing
[09:01:12] <ent58> perhaps the technical way to phrase that is our brains can use the information well beyond 144hz, but the actual seeing part might have marginal utility past that point
[09:01:33] <ent58> so if that's what you meant then you're absolutely right
[09:01:54] <arahael> ent58: You can still use a 144hz display and still have your game loop at 60 Hz.
[09:02:07] <ent58> well that would be silly :p

[09:24:55] <beaky> if my spec can be wrong why bother proving it correct
[09:25:34] <flakland> maybe you can use time crystals in your spec
[09:25:44] <arahael> ent58: Hmm, I suppose now that we don't have phosphorus we've linked it together with the display technology.
[09:25:47] <InPhase> beaky: The same way you would get a program correct.  1) Break the problem down into pieces.  2) Understand the full problem.  3) Build a spec up in pieces.  4) Understand the full spec.  5) Use this understanding of both to make sure the spec satisfies the problem.
[09:26:03] <arahael> ent58: But what if you had a really slow display?  In that case you'd want input to be /faster/ - eg, suppose we had an e-ink display.
[09:26:40] *** Quits: hexingb (~hexingb@103.37.140.25) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:26:44] <arahael> ent58: Or a really fast display, too fast for teh game's game loop implementation.
[09:26:45] <ent58> oh absolutely, in fact you're not wrong when you say "decoupling", it's just that the decoupled game loop is running at maximum possible update speed
[09:26:50] <ent58> and the display is the one that's behind
[09:26:51] <InPhase> beaky: But yes, this is why program proofs are not widely used.  It's not laziness.  It's that it mostly doesn't really do what needs done.
[09:26:52] <beaky> yes maybe i should focus more on step 1 and 3 where i can focus on getting the smallest parts of the spec 100% right
[09:27:22] <ent58> so for an e-ink device you would have an input delay mostly at the rate of the screen update speed
[09:27:41] <ent58> but for a display at 250hz, with a game loop running at 70-120
[09:27:45] <ent58> depending on load

[09:28:45] <ent58> if the OSK runs independent of the display's speed, then you're golden
[09:29:06] <arahael> ent58: "if" - is that really not a given these days on these devices?
[09:29:14] <ent58> it should be from what I understand
[09:29:37] <arahael> Hmm, so maybe that's why it's such a big thing - and it's mostly about the input latency.

[09:30:10] <ent58> there are games that purposely delay rendering back 1-2 frames, and in those cases, they are a significant fraction of the input latency

[09:33:30] <ent58> but
[09:33:37] <ent58> close enough is a thing
[09:33:53] <arahael> And of course it would be rendering the app as fast as it could: Double-buffered, etc - at teh end of each game/app frame, the buffers woudl swap and the displays would continue to display at the respective buffer.

[09:36:46] <ent58> Yeah so
[09:37:29] <ent58> if I were to design a display device for a computer, even years ago, making the thing giving the data to the display device tell the device when to render would have been obvious

[11:14:58] <ent58> are there any offhand good libraries for manually processing object file formats?
[11:15:29] <ent58> I think to do what I want to do, I have to do all the heavy lifting after the compiler has already duplicated every function I want merged
[11:15:30] <arahael> Nothing generic, unless you write a parser.
[11:16:33] <ent58> essentially it's just a special stage of object file processing where all functions in a particular object file with a custom format are diff-merged and the resulting metadata placed in its own special section with linkage
[11:16:54] <ent58> I guess I'm writing a COFF/ELF parser
[11:18:12] <ent58> I mean...can mingw compile to ELF64 object files easily? I don't mean like cross compiling, but using the ELF object format just for linkage, and smashing them into a PE+ afterward
[11:18:46] <ent58> obviously native gcc can, but I'm trying to find a switch to set the output object file format and it's actually kind of amazing how buried it is

[18:03:04] <dTal> so I need to write a real time raytracer type thing that's very heavy on querying data, and pretty light on calculating it
[18:04:08] <dTal> and my initial impulse was to write something in Julia using its CUDA support, and just blast 2d images at the screen

[19:45:31] <vdamewood> So the CPU runs code in firmware. That firmware is either a classic BIOS or UEFI. Most UEFI implementations also know how to load OS'es like a BIOS.
[19:45:48] <terminalpusher> ahhh I see now. So on all newer CPUs the UEFI does entirely replace the BIOS but if the software that boots acts as if it's a BIOS, the UEFI will just emulate the BIOS for backwards-compatibility

[20:01:32] <berndj> and also the reason for the far jmp that's typically the first instruction at FFFF0

[23:05:18] <vdamewood> hjf: 'is' is a convention. It's not a hard-and-fast rule.

[23:08:54] <[itchyjunk]> if you're confident it's better as is
[23:09:00] <decker> but a couple months of this would get old... in the case of seeing a let and just quoting 'always use const' is probably more like a knee jerk reaction than actually considering it - since so many people don't realize the difference
[23:09:09] <decker> and wouldn't take the nessecarily personally
[23:09:19] <hjf> i'm fine either way, i just don't think spending 2 weeks moving shit around is smart

[23:11:11] <vdamewood> I remember the last time I committed to a project. They asked for a bajillion and one tests, and I had to write them all.
[23:11:20] <decker> because they're spending their time being unproductive and throwing out attacks for no reason
[23:11:35] <pyzozord> also if he is trying to show how senior he is, he is failing because being senior is about convincing people to do stuff, and what he does now is the exact opposite

[23:14:49] <deniska> I fight the urge to refactor while I'm at it :D

[23:45:21] <[itchyjunk]> are List, Set, Map all interfaces? (Java)
[23:45:27] <BucetaRosa> yes
[23:45:36] <BucetaRosa> look at the oracle reference
[23:45:59] <BucetaRosa> I don't get why they ask textbook questions here
[23:46:17] <[itchyjunk]> because they want to
[23:46:23] <BucetaRosa> because they are lazy
[23:46:33] <[itchyjunk]> because different people learn differently
[23:46:36] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Yep.
[23:46:48] <decker> does java have a value type struct?
[23:46:52] <BucetaRosa> [itchyjunk]: that's a lame excuse. one simple click and you could have all these answers in the oracle reference
[23:46:55] <decker> aren't they all oh interfaces
[23:46:59] <pyzozord> BucetaRosa: they asks questions on all levels

[23:47:47] <pyzozord> BucetaRosa: lucky you :)

[23:48:09] <[itchyjunk]> I am doing my research.
[23:48:15] <BucetaRosa> was the oracle site not clear?
[23:48:17] <[itchyjunk]> I am asking humans.
[23:48:23] <[itchyjunk]> Was I not clear?
[23:48:24] <BucetaRosa> you never have been there, right?
[23:48:28] <[itchyjunk]> I prefer learning this way.
[23:48:35] <BucetaRosa> you are a lonely soul
[23:48:38] <[itchyjunk]> You don't have to like it.
[23:48:41] * BucetaRosa pities you
[23:48:46] <kmh> decker, well you can have instances of struct
[23:48:57] <[itchyjunk]> Start you own channel and stop people from asking questions from oracle.
[23:49:00] <decker> kmh but they're still really references/pointers?
[23:49:06] <BucetaRosa> I am not stopping anyone
[23:49:08] <kmh> asszming we're talking the classic c struct
[23:49:09] <decker> I misread 'interfaces' as 'references'
[23:49:09] <BucetaRosa> I am just intrigued
[23:49:17] <[itchyjunk]> You sure are calling people mentally ill.
[23:49:22] <[itchyjunk]> Maybe cut that out?
[23:49:25] <BucetaRosa> if you feel stopped by me, then you know you are doing something wrong
[23:49:36] <edgar-rft> you can ask the Edgar oracle instead :-)
[23:49:38] <kmh> decker, yes but that's sort of true for almost anything
[23:49:40] <[itchyjunk]> I feel annoyed by you calling me mentally ill.
[23:49:47] <BucetaRosa> i am not calling you anything
[23:49:49] <[itchyjunk]> Is that hard to understand?
[23:49:49] <pyzozord> BucetaRosa: no need for that, we try to be friendly here
[23:50:07] <[itchyjunk]> BucetaRosa when you make the channel rules here, fell free to do as you pelase
[23:50:09] <decker> kmh C# has 'struct' which is for like points x/y/z type stuff that's more like a number
[23:50:21] <BucetaRosa> I don't make any rules either :)

[23:50:31] <decker> kmh and C/C++ are flexible ... but ya mostly such things are pointers in everything else
[23:50:33] <[itchyjunk]> That part is obvious.
[23:50:38] <[itchyjunk]> There is a psychology channel
[23:50:46] <[itchyjunk]> but maybe you should just read documentation on people
[23:50:46] <kmh> decker, yes but what the different to a class without any explicit method?
[23:50:48] <[itchyjunk]> instead of asking on irc
[23:50:55] <BucetaRosa> [itchyjunk]: now YOU are trying to tell me where I should ask my questions :)
[23:51:00] <BucetaRosa> you are curious :)
[23:51:14] <[itchyjunk]> I'm suggesting you channels where psychology is relevant, eys

[23:51:50] <[itchyjunk]> turns out there is a secret "visibility" for fields in java
[23:52:00] <decker> kmh hmm it's more about the data storage than the methds I was talking about... but what?
[23:52:01] <[itchyjunk]> I am plenty efficient.
[23:52:07] <edgar-rft> let's take ##programming to a psychiatric level
[23:52:19] <[itchyjunk]> edgar-rft okay which language to use?
[23:52:25] <pyzozord> wouldn't the visability field be just what you control with public/protected/private?
[23:52:25] <[itchyjunk]> html?
[23:52:37] <edgar-rft> english is sufficient for that
[23:52:38] <[itchyjunk]> there is a "package" level visibility
[23:52:41] <[itchyjunk]> but is has no keyword
[23:52:54] <[itchyjunk]> if you specify nothing, it's package visibility
[23:53:01] <[itchyjunk]> I thought specifying nothing = public
[23:53:08] <[itchyjunk]> but woe! I was wrong
[23:53:09] *** Quits: akevinhuang (~thekevinh@user/thekevinhuang) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:53:12] <sonny> no, that's about the default package
[23:53:13] <pyzozord> oh right, I actually remember something about that
[23:53:25] <[itchyjunk]> sonny no to what part?
[23:53:40] <[itchyjunk]> not specifying visibility turns it to `package` visibility
[23:53:45] <[itchyjunk]> which is different from public
[23:53:59] <[itchyjunk]> and there is no keyword to get package level visibility either
[23:54:13] <sonny> yeah, it's having a package name
[23:54:36] <[itchyjunk]> `packagename` int variable name ?
[23:54:39] <sonny> public, protected, private are what specify the visibility 
[23:54:40] <[itchyjunk]> I don't think that works

[23:54:50] <[itchyjunk]> sonny so does not having anything.
[23:54:56] <[itchyjunk]> there is 4 visibility
[23:54:59] <[itchyjunk]> You're missing one.
[23:54:59] <sonny> package is the namespace in whcih you make these members available
[23:55:10] <sonny> there is always a package
[23:55:19] <[itchyjunk]> what does "always" mean?
[23:55:24] <[itchyjunk]> there is 4 visibility
[23:55:25] <BucetaRosa> I have a package for you
[23:55:29] <[itchyjunk]> 3 has keyword, 1 doesn't
[23:55:38] <BucetaRosa> there *are
[23:55:49] * BucetaRosa lends an english book to [itchyjunk]
[23:55:52] <sonny> hm, not sure I understand then
[23:56:37] <decker> are you going to shar [itchyjunk] or is it 'i know something you don't know'
[23:56:38] <[itchyjunk]> idk if there is more there to understand. but I learned about it only 2 days ago. "package level" visibility
[23:56:46] <[itchyjunk]> share what?
[23:56:55] <decker> the visibility keywords
[23:56:58] <[itchyjunk]> there is no keyword for it! I can't list the keyword
[23:57:13] <[itchyjunk]> public/private/restricted/<no keyword>
[23:57:13] <decker> so... how do you control it? and what's it matter if you can't?
[23:57:19] <sonny> java package is like c++ namespace but better
[23:57:24] <BucetaRosa> it's a secret keyword
[23:57:28] <decker> I see blank is more like a none of the above than anything you can specify
[23:57:33] <[itchyjunk]> you control it by not giving it a keyword
[23:57:42] <decker> yes... char* != unsigned char* != signed char*
[23:57:43] <[itchyjunk]> but it is not non specific
[23:57:46] <[itchyjunk]> it's very specific
[23:57:50] <[itchyjunk]> it's package visibilty
[23:57:59] <[itchyjunk]> its well defined internally, from what I understand
