[17:22:18] <CalimeroTeknik> opsec, wat, just wat
[17:25:27] <CalimeroTeknik> maybe include epilepsy warnings, when you post that sort of completely demented stuff that can't even be parodied

[17:41:51] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[17:42:55] <Joanna> Hi JimBuntu hows your tooth ?
[17:52:52] <jan6> lol
[17:53:39] <jan6> did you see the cultleader site opsec linked without any epilepsy warnings, Joanna? you were technically online at the time
[17:57:27] <Joanna> I just saw it it’s pretty unbearable without the reader view in browser
[17:57:36] <jan6> yep
[17:57:44] <Joanna> Cult leader :)
[18:01:26] <Joanna> jan6: do you have epilepsy?
[18:01:32] <jan6> nah
[18:01:49] <jan6> I didn't even bother to look at it, until CalimeroTeknik pointed it out half an hour ago
[18:02:33] <jan6> but I'd expect that to be a requirement to disclaim for at least that obvious links
[18:03:11] *** Quits: _mobot (~mobot@95.183.53.137) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:04:31] <jan6> it'd be very unfortunate for anyone who DID have epileptic episodes to open such a link, and get blasted with bright saturated moving, blinking, iridecent lights, with barely readable text
[18:04:32] <Joanna> What did you think of the content in there?
[18:05:00] <jan6> given the site's design, even less than what the content itself is, lol
[18:05:18] <Joanna> I usually close things like that immediately
[18:05:57] <jan6> problem is it might take only a second to trigger such people, nevermind just giving migranes to other people
[18:06:13] <Joanna> opsec: why is your website deliberately hard to read ?
[18:06:41] <jan6> (at least I'm not suscepible to migranes or epilepsy afaik, but that's still a horrible design)
[18:07:17] <Joanna> jan6: I’ve had problems with migraines before but his website doesn’t affect me because I don’t look at it for long or use reader view
[18:07:45] <jan6> for me to figure out where to even activate reader view from, would take some 10 seconds minimum, lol
[18:08:16] <Joanna> It’s definitely off putting I’m not sure what he is doing
[18:09:23] <Joanna> I think some browsers will do it for you or there is an option to do it by default
[18:10:28] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.36.117.129)
[18:10:45] <jan6> except doing it by default can break many other sites
[18:11:24] <Joanna> You can un reader view it certainly
[18:11:39] <jan6> sure
[18:12:03] <Joanna> Hi _inky hows your bot?
[18:12:22] <Joanna> I tried to use but couldn’t a moment ago
[18:12:55] <Joanna> I like that reader view is usually dark

[18:38:06] <_inky> now i am doing something else with it, improving other parts of code.

[19:25:29] <CalimeroTeknik> honestly if we look at the content of the webpage in reader mode, it's a perfect example of a mix of seeing things under a paranoid (but legitimate angle, plausible paranoid speculation, and outright bullshit
[19:27:02] <CalimeroTeknik> the plausible and correct (but oriented) stuff is what might lead some people to give credit to the bullshit
[19:27:55] <CalimeroTeknik> generally speaking, all that's being pretended there is pretty much the usual narrative in alt-right circles
[19:28:33] <CalimeroTeknik> some is right, some is plausible speculation with no proof that it's real, and some is provably incorrect
[19:29:54] <CalimeroTeknik> but without critical thinking you'd easily swallow everything
[19:30:07] <CalimeroTeknik> and sourcing, always searching and sourcing
[19:31:59] <jan6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jzKtAqN5e0
[19:32:38] <jan6> apparently sneaking/hiding away mid-conversation is a totally feasible thing, because nobody expects you to be gone immediately after talking
[19:40:57] <opsec> Joanna: it needs to be
