[00:00:30] <kuudes> from danish data, different day duration presumptions between infection and hospitalization and their effects on hospitalization risk
[00:01:11] <kuudes> ie if we presume that from when a person gets infected, it takes on average 7 days for them to end up to hospital conditional they do end to hospital
[00:01:41] <kuudes> that would mean 0.88% of omicron infected people in denmark get to hospital so far, and 0.40% of those infected with delta
[00:01:44] <Guest87678> I'm too poor to order food delivered daily, but I guess I might go to shop once a week only from now on
[00:03:01] <kuudes> so, if we want to presume that omicron is less severe than delta, ie that less of infected people get hospitalized, we must presume either that omicron takes people to hospital much sooner than delta, at most 6 days while delta takes double of that, or that if they both take the same delay, then the delay must be less than 4 days for omicron to be less severe of them so far
[00:03:36] <two2thehead> kuudes, we will *probably* some interesting data on spread *between* households
[00:03:57] <two2thehead> Every other variant was less contagious compared to omicron
[00:04:00] <kuudes> otoh if we presume 7 day delay, then for omicron 0,88% end up hospitalized and for delta 0,40%; presuming 14 day delay between infection and hospitalization we get 5.41% and 0.60%
[00:04:07] <two2thehead> and since most households don't have hepa filters...
[00:04:22] <kuudes> two2thehead, omicron spreads within household about 3x compared to delta
[00:04:55] <kuudes> but spxtr, this implies that omicron very likely would be more severe than delta, possibly noticeably more severe
[00:05:22] <two2thehead> huh (._.)?
[00:05:40] <kuudes> danish data likely will be more thorough and comparable to developed countries than south africa's data, where population is both much younger and the seed population was on university, so the people in the first batch there have been mostly 20-30 years olds
[00:05:41] <two2thehead> well... rural counties in the US are fricked
[00:06:14] <kuudes> personally, I still stand by my presumption that a booster per 13 weeks is a good idea.
[00:08:14] <two2thehead> kuudes, are they releasing boosters that often/can they release boosters than often?
[00:09:01] <kuudes> booster is just the same stuff as other doses
[00:09:25] <kuudes> just keep injecting comirnaty dose once per 13 weeks until you decide otherwise
[00:09:34] <kuudes> I am not a doctor etc
[00:09:42] <two2thehead> ah
[00:09:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Not even slightly. The loss has gotten more complete, in fact
[00:09:52] <kuudes> :-(
[00:10:01] <kuudes> my condolences
[00:10:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> thx :\
[00:10:50] <kuudes> but yeah, it seems plausible that sort of 1/1000 of population or something *everywhere* will seek hospitalization around week 1/2022
[00:11:08] <kuudes> and therefore one does not want to be among them.
[00:11:29] <kuudes> and therefore -> booster, self isolation, avoid dangerous things like fireworks
[00:12:01] <kuudes> also, self isolation is prosocial as well, as then you reduce the spread and create less demand for hospitals yourself
[00:12:43] <maplefinger> hot take, omicron not that bad at all, probably just more boomer remover
[00:14:13] <rmmh> actually seems to be migrating up the respiratory tract for more infectivity which is great news
[00:16:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> maplefinger: That's bad, in fact

[02:44:58] <kuudes> me neither
[02:45:32] <kuudes> best explaining narrative to me is that they want to send the vaccines to africa as who recommended, but even that has seemed to not explain it always well
[02:46:12] <kuudes> btw now that I learned from south africa that there people younger than 9 have had it more worse than people aged 20-24 in all waves in the past, I was pretty surprised
[02:46:26] <kuudes> I was expecting the vitality peak would be around age 6, but it was much later
[02:46:36] <kuudes> this means that vaccines to kids should have been a nobrainer
[02:46:47] <maplefinger> very wrong conclusion
[02:47:11] <kuudes> because the main cause against was that they have it mild if they get covid, so the averse effects should be proven to be less than that

He suggested that the poet John Milton had employed both an amanuensis and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position.[12] A. E. Housman, who called him "the greatest scholar that
[06:03:54] <feepbot> England or perhaps that Europe ever bred" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: "we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour.

[06:28:53] <Shelby> does anyone have any familiarity with therapy or suicide or anything? I was seeing a therapist but I got fired the other day and no cash and I feel like talking to some one about my sucidial ideation but i dont know who to speak to
[06:32:15] <dv2> If you're thinking about killing yourself, you can go to the ER?
[06:33:20] <adiabatic> Aren't there suicide hotlines in .au too full of people who'll try and talk you out of it?
[06:33:22] <Shelby> i work for the government and that kind of think reflects badly on future jobs so its not super good of an idea. tbh i dont think im at that level anyway. I think about suicide a bit but i dont have it in me to actually do it anyway. I dont think i'd be brave enough (or whatever coin of phrase you prefer) to go through with it
[06:34:03] <Shelby> yeah, last time i called it was good but they just try to push you to therapy and try to talk you out of it but i like i cant do it anyway and i dont have the money for therapy atm
[06:34:14] <nshepperd2> #lw-support? idk if it's active though
[06:34:30] <Shelby> its okay just thought id try on here because i guess people on lw are thoughtful and think about taboo topics a bit
[06:34:31] <Shelby> thanks

[06:35:40] <Robomot> Peer support for anyone struggling with suicidal thoughts (Peer support for anyone struggling with suicidal thoughts.)
[06:36:35] <adiabatic> I was in school listening to one of my classmates give a speech and her topic was about suicide and one of the memes she mentioned was "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"
[06:36:47] <adiabatic> that one stuck with me, even though I hadn't thought about suicide at the time
[06:36:58] <Shelby> yeah
[06:37:00] <Shelby> i get that
[06:37:19] <Shelby> i guess its not really about the long term ness of it more its about the ending of ongoing suffering
[06:37:23] <adiabatic> what I ended up internalizing was "well, if you've got a problem, and you're thinking about killing yourself, make damn sure your problem is permanent first"
[06:37:49] <Shelby> yeah i guess thats true
[06:38:08] <adiabatic> a lot of problems seem to be "well, hm, this one _might_ be permanent…I'll stick it out a bit more to see if it is"
[06:38:28] <Shelby> I know lately ive just had a series of bad luck happen all at once, but sometimes it just feels like it'd be a lot better for everyone around me if i wasnt here and then like if i factor in how much i dislike my current life it seems more logical than anything tbh
[06:38:35] <Shelby> yeah true
[06:38:35] <adiabatic> my big problem ended up not being super duper permanent, but boy oh boy did it stick around a long fucking time
[06:39:03] <Shelby> and like i know im not gonna do it because i think im too much of a P*ssy to even do it.. so i will be sticking it out, just feels like a waste though
[06:39:33] <adiabatic> "pussy"
[06:39:36] <adiabatic> you can type "pussy" here
[06:39:42] <Shelby> it felt like it was gone for a bit, like the sucidial ideation
[06:40:30] <Shelby> but today a couple things triggered it and i just feel shit again... get obssessed with the idea of like apoptosis... kind of feel like i was supposed to die but just didnt like a cancer cell or something tbh
[06:41:02] <feep> that sounds not like reasonable reasons to die sound
[06:41:33] <adiabatic> yeah, I knew this miserable cuss who was basically confined to an iron lung or had some kind of that-bad medical condition
[06:41:45] <adiabatic> and all he did was commiepoast on the Internet all day
[06:42:00] <adiabatic> granted, he fucking earned his miserableness
[06:42:12] <feep> there's an eliezer quote, I can't find it right now, where he's like as a rule if the voice in your head sounds like an evil monster that's possessing you, you should not listen to it
[06:42:16] <adiabatic> actually I kind of wonder why he didn't give up
[06:42:29] <adiabatic> 'cause I sure as fuck would've
[06:42:31] <Shelby> i have a decent paying job, or had, got fired on tuesday. but i start a new job next year.. but even when i wasnt fired i was so broke from medical things that i kept going into more credit card debt each week. i did just get out of an intense realtionship where my ex tried to actually kill her self and then she just kept like being very
[06:42:32] <Shelby> vindictative and manipulative until we broke up.. but yeah i dunno just today being super broke, a date also cancelled on me and i got told i cant take money out of my super for the medical expenses an i wont be starting till the 4th of jan
[06:42:54] <Shelby> commiepoast
[06:43:03] <Shelby> is that like post about communism? lol
[06:43:08] <adiabatic> "all" you need to do is hang on until january 4. Can you do that?
[06:43:26] <Shelby> yeah but i was broke while still working, this new job is a 3$ /hour improvement.. im still gonna be broke af
[06:43:40] <Shelby> i will hang on anyway so it doesnt matter
[06:43:47] <Shelby> i just feel really useless
[06:44:03] <saturn2> how many other people do you think are "a waste"?
[06:44:13] <Shelby> like kind of trapped, not just financially but like even with the whole suicide thing i cant even muster the courage and like i dunno just feel shit
[06:44:17] <Shelby> no one
[06:44:23] <Shelby> i dont have a lot of negative emotions to others
[06:44:28] <saturn2> so you're the worst person on earth?
[06:44:32] <Shelby> just good ol' self hatred
[06:44:44] <Shelby> umm no
[06:44:45] <Shelby> i dont think im a bad person tbh
[06:45:15] <saturn2> you suffer the most, then?
[06:45:20] <Shelby> i did get a bit of hatred towards my best mate who died like 11 years ago the other day when i took acid and got really frustrate and angry at him for recklessly driving and dying when we were young
[06:45:29] <Shelby> i feel like i def suffer more then most people
[06:46:04] <feep> I think what saturn2 is getting at is that if you think you're not bad, and you should still kill yourself, even though nobody else should
[06:46:06] <Shelby> but yeah i dont have much hate to anyone else. i do get aggression though, so i think i channel that towards my self a bit more then usual
[06:46:08] <feep> don't make much sense.
[06:46:18] <Shelby> why doesn't that make sense
[06:46:32] <Shelby> even though im not bad i seem to piss people off a lot
[06:46:39] <feep> cause there's a spike in your "should die" function in a weird place that's not correlated with badness
[06:46:48] <Shelby> unintentionally. im fairly blunt and get categorised as abbrasive a bit
[06:46:53] <feep> but that happens to be where "you" is
[06:47:11] <Shelby> no the should die is escalated higher because i feel bad all the time because i dislike my life not because im failing in any moral sense
[06:47:29] <feep> right, I'm just trying to illustrate that the feeling sounds like an error.
[06:47:40] <Shelby> hmmm
[06:47:45] <Shelby> i dont see it tbh
[06:47:46] <feep> just to have that established.
[06:48:13] <feep> well if you should die because reasons, it means if other people have reasons worse and they shouldn't die, there's something weird going on, right?
[06:48:28] <Shelby> yeah that almost feels like more evidence that i should though, not less
[06:48:57] <feep> well it's inconsistent at least.
[06:49:02] <Shelby> like i dislike my life so much an feel im suffering all the time, yet people have far worst lives then me and are happy.. now i know theres like a distinction when you're at the bottom of maslows hierachy where you only care about getting to the top first
[06:49:06] <saturn2> feep: you understood what i was getting at but i was on the wrong track though
[06:49:54] <Shelby> i now feel better then i did two weeks ago when me and my ex broke up.. then i felt like i wante to want to die. now i just feel like i want to die, but not like i want to want to die.. probs doesnt make sense
[06:50:06] <feep> no that makes perfect sense
[06:50:26] <feep> the brain is often internally inconsistent
[06:50:40] <Shelby> i dont really know what to do financially tbh. last time i was this broke i did naughty stuff and got out of my debt that way.. i dont have that option this time
[06:50:45] <Shelby> maybe i should sell my dog:(
[06:50:58] <feep> that seems like a bad idea
[06:51:10] <feep> well, it's a balance.
[06:51:21] <feep> should a generic depressed person in debt sell their dog?
[06:51:31] <Shelby> it feels consistent to me. like before i think i enjoyed the feeling of wanting to die a little because i could atleast focus my mind on sonething and i was technically a bit more productive.. but now i dont care and dont even want that an just feel shit
[06:51:33] <feep> does that seem like good policy? I'm not sure
[06:51:44] <Shelby> if i sol my dog i could move to a smaller house
[06:51:54] <Shelby> i dont really want to tbh
[06:51:59] <feep> yeah fair
[06:52:03] <Shelby> but im not really staying afloat as it is an hes a big dog
[06:52:14] <Shelby> i dunno
[06:52:39] <Shelby> i do sometimes feel like hes the only thing that loves me so maybe its not the best call
[06:52:48] <feep> yeah that's what I was thinking
[06:53:04] <feep> good to have evidence there's at least one thing that loves you on hand
[06:53:22] <Shelby> wish i could drink tbh, i know its not a good call often but i think if i got super drunk id feel better the next day. but i cant drink until like 10 th of janurary because im on antibiotics and nee surgery
[06:54:00] * PlanckWalk has not had good evidence for anyone ever feelign better the day after beign super drunk.
[06:54:02] <saturn2> are you in debt because of medical expenses?
[06:54:11] <Shelby> somewhat
[06:54:37] <Shelby> partly that and partly the rental im at, i should probably get a room mate since my gf moved out
[06:54:43] <feep> yeah I think this is a thing where you should probably let things roll until your new job starts, unless you have something to do that you would recommend to another depressed person
[06:54:57] <feep> in a similar situation
[06:55:03] <Shelby> i used to always feel good after drinking
[06:55:09] <Shelby> like the next day weirdly enough
[06:55:16] <Shelby> seemed to fix my adhd or something
[06:55:44] <gwern> the afterglow effect
[06:55:49] <Shelby> but yeah i aint got shit. i was talking to someone else with suicidal ideation the otherday and i did recommend stuff to her.. but was kind of redudant because im at the same place as her lol
[06:56:40] <Shelby> im actually glad i got fired, that boring work was crushing me. but it didnt help im broke.
[06:56:41] <Shelby> I want to try to make money online but got i keep sucking at making any big splash and getting like freelance clients
[06:56:50] <Shelby> gwern you're really smart, what do you do when you feel down?
[06:57:04] <Shelby> (if gwern ever feels down)
[06:58:28] <adiabatic> people move during the Christmas holidays so if you want to start defraying expenses, now would be a decent time
[07:00:56] <Shelby> hmm yeah been thinking of trying to get my super (like 401k in australia) out and move to america.. takes a lot of effort to try and get it out though

[19:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/team-builds-first-living-robots-that-can-reproduce/
[19:04:41] <Robomot> Team builds first living robots—that can reproduce (AI-designed Xenobots reveal entirely new form of biological self-replication—promising for regenerative medicine)
[19:05:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In earlier experiments, the scientists were amazed that Xenobots could be designed to achieve simple tasks. Now they are stunned that these biological objects—a computer-designed collection of cells—will spontaneously replicate. “We have the full, unaltered frog genome,” says Levin, “but it gave no hint that these cells can work together on this new task,” of gathering and then compressing separated cells into
[19:05:39] <Obormot\Arcturus>  working self-copies."
[19:05:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "On its own, the Xenobot parent, made of some 3,000 cells, forms a sphere. “These can make children but then the system normally dies out after that. It’s very hard, actually, to get the system to keep reproducing,” says Kriegman. But with an artificial intelligence program working on the Deep Green supercomputer cluster at UVM’s Vermont Advanced Computing Core, an evolutionary algorithm was able to test billions of
[19:05:52] <Obormot\Arcturus>  body shapes in simulation—triangles, squares, pyramids, starfish—to find ones that allowed the cells to be more effective at the motion-based “kinematic” replication reported in the new research."
[19:06:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“We asked the supercomputer at UVM to figure out how to adjust the shape of the initial parents, and the AI came up with some strange designs after months of chugging away, including one that resembled Pac-Man,” says Kriegman. “It’s very non-intuitive. It looks very simple, but it’s not something a human engineer would come up with. Why one tiny mouth? Why not five? We sent the results to Doug and he built these
[19:06:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Pac-Man-shaped parent Xenobots. Then those parents built children, who built grandchildren, who built great-grandchildren, who built great-great-grandchildren.” In other words, the right design greatly extended the number of generations."
[19:06:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“We’ve discovered that there is this previously unknown space within organisms, or living systems, and it’s a vast space,” says Bongard. “How do we then go about exploring that space? We found Xenobots that walk. We found Xenobots that swim. And now, in this study, we’ve found Xenobots that kinematically replicate. What else is out there?”"
[19:07:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Definitely in the "here we demonstrate a practical means of constructing the torment nexus" category
[19:08:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> The team takes the risks seriously, of course:
[19:08:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Some people may find this exhilarating. Others may react with concern, or even terror, to the notion of a self-replicating biotechnology. For the team of scientists, the goal is deeper understanding. ... These millimeter-sized living machines, entirely contained in a laboratory, easily extinguished, and vetted by federal, state and institutional ethics experts, “are not what keep me awake at night. What presents risk is the
[19:08:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  next pandemic; accelerating ecosystem damage from pollution; intensifying threats from climate change,” says UVM’s Bongard."
[19:08:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... sorry, did I say "takes the risks seriously"? I meant, uh
[19:08:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> the opposite of that
[19:08:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“This is an ideal system in which to study self-replicating systems. We have a moral imperative to understand the conditions under which we can control it, direct it, douse it, exaggerate it.”"
[19:09:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... a moral imperative! Haha! To understand the conditions under which we can direct it and exaggerate it! Under which, we might say, it gains... function...
[19:10:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“We need to create technological solutions that grow at the same rate as the challenges we face,” Bongard says." ... exponentially, one must assume he means
[19:11:18] <nshepperd2> gosh, something entirely contained in a laboratory, easily extinguished, and vetted by federal, state and institutional ethics experts couldn't possibly escape from a lab and kill millions of people
[19:12:54] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobot to be fair, 'frog muscle cells' are a pretty bad starting point for 'infect humans' or 'kill millions of people' as opposed to 'another coronavirus, part of a versatile family that has collectively killed hundreds of millions of humans for centuries'
[19:12:54] <Robomot> Xenobot - Wikipedia (Xenobots, named after the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis),[1][2] are synthetic lifeforms that are designed by computers to perform some desired function and built by combining together different biological tissues.[3][4][5][6][7][1] Whether xenobots are robots, organisms, or something else entirely remains a subject of debate among scientists.)
