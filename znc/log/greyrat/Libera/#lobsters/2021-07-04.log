[18:53:23] <calpaterson> i'm not exactly captain javascript but i suppose i feel like the js standard is going in a  vaguely positive direction.  do you feel like they make mostly insane decisions?
[18:53:43] <companion_cube> I'm really no expert, but it's more that the language started in a bad place
[18:53:51] <companion_cube> seems like it's gone in the right direction most of the time
[18:54:01] <c355e3b> ActionScript 4 is the "sane" version of JS imo
[18:54:04] <companion_cube> better scoping, bigints, clean lambdas…
