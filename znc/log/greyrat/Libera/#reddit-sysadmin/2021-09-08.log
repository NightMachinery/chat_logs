[05:13:05] <catbeard> i know that's true on linux unless your user/group has CAP_NET_BIND or something
[05:14:06] <xe0n> sounds like there should be a separate environment for dev so they screw around with services and junk
[05:14:12] <catbeard> but yeah anyway, you could also composer/laravel in wsl and just use sqlite3 driver for ORM
[05:14:50] <xe0n> get that budget :P
[05:14:57] <catbeard> then you have webserver, database, and a framework, also laravel/composer is free
[05:15:31] <xe0n> sure, but it sounds like all this should be done within an isolated environment so the correct permissions required can be given without risking breaking prod or whatever
[05:15:32] <xe0n> lol
[05:15:48] <catbeard> it is isolated, it's run on the workstation and not on a central server that runs a binary as admin
[05:15:57] <xe0n> im not talking about yours lol
[05:16:12] <catbeard> just saying it's free and compatible with windows
[05:16:20] <catbeard> and helps with webdev tons
[05:17:37] <Work-BWMerlin> This is for a computer lab so is an separate environment
[05:18:10] <catbeard> you can simply php -S 10.x.x.x:highport and check that from another lab pc
[05:18:44] <xe0n> right, so if its a lab, and the machines are getting used and trashed and rebuilt or whatever, is there a possibility of providing a different set of creds for this class
[05:18:57] <xe0n> labs are there to be trashed and abused lol
[05:19:00] <xe0n> and rebuilt however many times lol
[05:20:06] <catbeard> pxe boot ubuntu
[05:20:25] <catbeard> and just preload your pxe image with all the correct tools
[05:20:51] <catbeard> nocps helps
[05:21:09] <xe0n> ....they're using windows tools, so the solution isnt to change the operating environment lol
[05:21:22] <catbeard> well that's half the problem
[05:21:27] <xe0n> oh please
[05:21:53] <catbeard> is he teaching webdev or a windows class
[05:22:15] <xe0n> ........
[05:22:42] <catbeard> webdev on windows as your dev environment is fraught with windows-specific pitfalls, unless the webdev is windows-specific
[05:22:48] <xe0n> whatever the curriculum says is required is required
[05:23:19] <catbeard> if you're installing apache anyway, might as well not take 2 weeks to configure
[05:23:23] <xe0n> you think changing tools and what not to what you think is better going to help the teacher who is teaching this stuff? they're learning material is with the current tools
[05:25:40] <catbeard> yes, that's nowhere near current
[05:25:53] <catbeard> i mean i realize you mean current as in "what they have right now"
[05:26:09] <catbeard> but good lord, at least get out of the dark ages
[05:28:05] <catbeard> there's a reason frameworks are a thing, they've already learned about how to use the language being taught, and it's testable/maintained, so you don't have to waste years reinventing the wheel in some hacky grab-bag of class require_once's
[05:31:55] <xe0n> ....you cant just change stuff up for a sake of doing it because "the tools are outdated\not favoured\whatever"
[05:32:06] <catbeard> if you're teaching shit like variadic functions and like extending with Zend C API calls, then ignore me, but if it's just a webdev class, you may as well use environments that will somewhat mirror a production environment for an employer
[05:32:22] <xe0n> sure, get the school board to approve that stuff first :)
[05:32:44] <xe0n> you cant just change up a schools curriculum, simple

[05:36:17] <xe0n> [2021.09.08.10:42:49] <xe0n> sounds like you need a separate environment for this stuff
[05:36:49] <catbeard> and just don't give your elevated app DA privs
[05:37:10] <xe0n> im sure Work-BWMerlin logs on with a DA account daily :P

[05:37:11] <xe0n> haha
[05:37:26] <rpifan> xe0n, have you particpated in a pub crawl event
[05:37:32] <rpifan> it might surprise you to know i have never done such a thing
[05:37:41] <catbeard> vicious lies
[05:37:46] <rpifan> no no its true
[05:37:48] <corn266> are you actually asking xe0n that
[05:37:54] <rpifan> its not really a gay thing 
[05:37:57] <corn266> rpifan https://open.spotify.com/track/7mtJeiA4HQiWoTY2OtoxFZ?si=0f0a612368434d4f
[05:38:03] <rpifan> its rare that we have enough bars to actually do it
[05:38:08] <xe0n> pub crawl? yeah man
[05:38:10] <rpifan> most of bars are usually really spaced out 
[05:38:14] <rpifan> so you cant just crawl to them
[05:38:23] <catbeard> you could..
[05:38:28] <catbeard> if you were inebriated enough
[05:38:32] <xe0n> ^^
[05:38:37] <xe0n> that's the "crawl" part
[05:38:39] <rpifan> xe0n, a british one is coming over and he has warned me that we are going 'bar hoping' so be prepared
[05:38:44] <rpifan> im not sure what that means
[05:38:54] <catbeard> going to a bunch of bars
[05:38:56] <xe0n> means you're going to have a drink at one bar, go to the next, rinse repeat
[05:38:57] <rpifan> but i know the british enjoy binge drinking like the australians
[05:38:58] <corn266> if i could take every thought you ever had
[05:39:10] <catbeard> basically it's to pick up chicks
[05:39:11] <rpifan> but is it usually just one drink at a time
[05:39:17] <rpifan> is it this liek speed drinking
[05:39:19] <catbeard> wherever you're at, the place is lame!
[05:39:50] <corn266> are you actually asking bout a pub crawl
[05:39:58] <corn266> it's what the name fucking implies
[05:40:06] <rpifan> 'beware we will be bar hoping'
[05:40:16] <rpifan> im not sure why i should beware but if he said it im sure its a threat of some kind
[05:40:16] <rpifan> lol
[05:40:22] <corn266> <beware, we'll try to smash and crash>
[05:40:38] <corn266> you're smart rpifan, but you dumb
[05:41:28] <rpifan> well he is a gay as well and its the largest fetish gay event in berlin of the year, so theortically there are enough bars even with covid open for a crawl to happen
[05:41:41] <rpifan> but its really unusual to go a bar a gay that is not your designated place
[05:41:48] <corn266> no one gives a shit about you gays
[05:41:55] <rpifan> we have rules you see, you dont just go to the bear bar for no reason
[05:41:55] <corn266> we fuck and we tuck
[05:42:03] <corn266> you absolute retard
[05:42:11] <rpifan> or the leather bar usually required leather, so i stick to the neutral place
[05:42:20] <rpifan> corn266, im trying to teach you peopel some gay culture
[05:42:23] <rpifan> now shut up and listen
[05:42:25] <rpifan> lool
[05:42:36] <corn266> igaf about the gays and their culture

[05:43:27] <xe0n> lol!
[05:43:31] <rpifan> oh god
[05:43:33] <xe0n> yes its common

[08:21:40] <gibby> TIL people who listen to Kanye are vagina watchers. 
[08:21:40] <xe0n> i think the icing on the carrot cake makes it....more enjoyable
[08:21:47] <homura> nuts are crucial
[08:22:00] <technonerd> nuts are terrible
[08:22:08] <misspwn> doesn't go in banana bread, doesn't go in carrot cake
[08:22:12] <misspwn> fight me
[08:22:22] <xe0n> banana bread is goooood
[08:22:28] <misspwn> dude
[08:22:31] <gibby> nuts have no place in anything, including snacks. 
[08:22:36] <misspwn> i don't know if you have this thing called apple butter
[08:22:39] <technonerd> choco chips go in banananana bread
[08:22:39] <homura> XD
[08:22:44] <misspwn> but it goes so great on banana bread its insane
[08:22:46] <gibby> apple butter is baw
[08:22:54] <gibby> s/baw/bae
[08:22:55] <xe0n> apple...butter....as in apple sauce?
[08:22:55] <layer8> gibby meant: "apple butter is bae"
[08:23:00] <gibby> nononono
[08:23:03] <misspwn> best way to describe is like fancy applesauce?
[08:23:04] <gibby> apple butter
[08:23:08] <technonerd> bawbeee
[08:23:15] <homura> nuts go in everything

[08:23:30] <gibby> homura: no.
[08:24:06] <homura> gibby: what then? is it the taste? how does nut ruin anything?
[08:24:21] <misspwn> well for starters, you have to like nuts
[08:24:25] <gibby> taste, texture, everything. 
[08:24:41] <gibby> the only nut I'm good with is from the tip 
[08:25:08] <misspwn> are you okay with syrup touching savory food?
[08:25:15] <misspwn> i.e syrup touching eggs
[08:25:22] <gibby> s/from the tip/noting/
[08:25:23] <xe0n> oh shit we back at chocolate bacon pancakes?
[08:25:23] <layer8> gibby meant: "the only nut I'm good with is noting "
[08:25:29] <homura> it's not the same thing
[08:25:39] <gibby> fucks sake -_-
[08:25:51] <xe0n> i dont mind pine nuts....in pesto
[08:25:56] <misspwn> the correct answer is no, because not a monster
[08:26:00] <gibby> misspwn: yes, because its sweet
[08:26:01] <xe0n> otherwise i wont take the snickers bar you've offered me
[08:26:04] <xe0n> i will take the twix though
[08:26:21] <misspwn> yeah but pine nuts make up pesto
[08:26:25] <gibby> though, I will say, Scouts ruined eggs for me for life :(
[08:26:27] <xe0n> :DDDD
[08:26:37] <xe0n> PESTO PINENUT PENNE
[08:26:38] <xe0n> YUM
[08:26:38] <misspwn> someone thought they'd ruin a good banana bread by putting walnuts in there
[08:26:41] <xe0n> i could eat that!
[08:26:46] <xe0n> good to clear the gut, destory the toilet
[08:26:51] <xe0n> walnuts
[08:26:52] <xe0n> no thanks!
[08:26:57] <gibby> NUTS. DONT. GO. IN. BREAD. 
[08:27:01] <xe0n> ++
[08:27:02] <homura> when you eat carrot cake, nuts give you something to nibble on
[08:27:09] <misspwn> like to take pesto and pan fry some gnocchi in it

[13:48:05] <iloominaty> Hi, ive been wanting to improve the documentation situation in my workplace and really want to set up a proper wiki like BookStack for example, since we have branches in the EU and US i was thinking maybe latency would be a issue?
[13:48:11] <iloominaty> or would it be neglible since its mostly text?
[13:48:28] <xe0n> latency?
[13:48:39] <xe0n> errr just use a SaaS offering lol
[13:49:03] <iloominaty> Like Confluence?
[13:49:05] <xe0n> sure
[13:49:40] <iloominaty> You know what, now that i think about it. it would be a pretty shitty situation to store documentation on a site if that site goes down
[13:49:54] <iloominaty> Maybe you're right
[13:50:18] <Hunterkll> if latency was an issue people in south africa wouldn' tbe able to use wikipedia
[13:50:19] <Hunterkll> XD
[13:50:35] <Hunterkll> also, docuwiki is a stupid small/simple to set up wiki software if you want to go down that route
[13:50:36] <iloominaty> Im guessing wikipedia uses CDN's
[13:50:39] <Hunterkll> i use it to host my personal website 
[13:50:40] <Hunterkll> sure
[13:50:41] <Hunterkll> but like
[13:50:52] <Hunterkll> yer still talkin 100ms+ latencies down there
[13:50:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:51:25] <iloominaty> heh
[13:51:34] <Hunterkll> latency: dont worry about it
[13:52:00] <iloominaty> All right, thanks
[13:52:05] <Hunterkll> if my vcenter on my desktop works for boxes hosted 3,300 miles away
[13:52:09] <Hunterkll> im pretty sure a web app will be fine

[21:23:06] <A-KO> so that's kind of why lol

[21:23:27] <Hunterkll> you learn so damn much interrelated shit
[21:23:37] <A-KO> considering I like to do deep drives into the national parks where there's no fucking cell towers at all--if I break down or have a problem

[21:25:32] <Hunterkll> if you're standing next to the highway and have cell signal, expect a sizable fine and revocation of license, at minimum
[21:25:34] <A-KO> Hunterkll: Sure , but having the license allows me to do all of the testing/checking out/experimenting without being in an emergency :P
[21:25:47] <Hunterkll> but if all you have functional is the handheld?
