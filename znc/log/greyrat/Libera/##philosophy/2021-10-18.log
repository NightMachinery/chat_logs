[01:04:47] <causative> Digit, it sounds like you are applying the label "naive realism" to philosophical positions that are not naive realism
[01:05:09] <Digit> please do elaborate so i can understand where and how so
[01:05:09] <causative> like, it sounds like you are using "naive realism" to label any kind of realism as naive
[01:05:26] <causative> I already elaborated
[01:05:46] <causative> by describing exactly what naive realism is and why hardly anyone holds it
[01:05:47] <Digit> i'm not sure how you've derived this.
[01:05:56] <causative> which should have resolved the confusion
[01:06:14] <Digit> but, y... wait, that was serious?   i thought you were doing naive realism to show the farce of it...
[01:06:26] <causative> if I say, "the world is much as science has revealed it to us, with things made of atoms and quarks and so forth," this is *not* naive realism
[01:06:28] <causative> this is scientific realism
[01:06:46] <causative> a different kind of realism
[01:07:17] <Digit> when i say naive realism, i tend to go by "that which i think, is reality", for a pithy off-the-cuff definition/depiction/explanation.
[01:07:35] <causative> well, that would be incorrect, according to how the term is used in philosophy

[01:27:04] <Digit> hyperbole (no matter the strength of my kneejerk).  if i were to claim such, i'd only be doing so as a comedic/satirical/roasting/goading send-up of the epistemological error, but i see now, if i were to, i'd need take care to deploy enough smilies for poe's law dodging, since evidently to some this would not be apparent.  expands my acceptance of people, and my not expecting (anything in general, but specifically e.g. similar

[01:29:36] <causative> Digit, do you make a distinction between scientific realism and naive realism? That is, do you accept that someone may believe things are made of atoms, without saying that person subscribes to "naive realism"?
[01:30:41] <Digit> idk, maybe a venn diagram.

[01:32:28] <causative> Digit, do you believe the view that "the world is generally made of the stuff science says it is, as far as science is correct, and science is mostly correct" is naive realism?
[01:32:44] <I_Am_M00t> :D
[01:33:32] <Digit> causative: also... isnt your question answered in my big glut there?   ... in so far as commenting on reluctance to derive plausible extrapolations based on not knowing either the whole set nor the rules of the whole set?  ... wouldnt that imply scientific realism?
[01:34:34] <causative> in philosophy it is very hard to tell what people really mean unless they answer direct questions through elenchus
[01:35:03] <causative> in this particular case I don't know what you are saying would "imply scientific realism"
[01:35:21] <causative> and whether something does or does not imply scientific realism was not the question
[01:36:16] <Digit> causative: i advocate non-belief.  any time i find a belief, i try exorcise it by thought experiments to show myself some of how much more there is, to relieve me of whatever certainties and overlookings and arrogances caused the belief in the first place, and to help prevent (lol) naive realism creaping in, seeing belief as a terrible tool with which to ascertain reality... like taking a paintbrush and bucket of paint where a telescope

[01:36:37] <causative> that's not what naive realism means
[01:37:38] <Digit> so no, i'll try my best to neither believe nor disbelieve ... *looks to what was asked after that*... lol.  science is the search for truth, and those who turn it into a religion with dogmas claiming to have found it, you should run away from.  ;D

[01:45:09] <causative> I don't like that "debate pyramid" diagram - it's missing levels for "asking questions to find out more about the other person's position" and "answering such questions"

[04:16:30] <Jong> Hi.
[04:17:00] <Jong> Does anyone here think the human body is machine?
[04:17:07] <Jong> Well, what is a machine?
[04:17:41] <Jong> "A machine is any physical system with ordered structural and functional properties." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine
[04:17:42] <ro-bot-o> [url] Machine - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[04:18:25] <Jong> If the human body is a machine, does that mean that we could potentially figure out how to modify it so we live forever?
[04:18:53] <Jong> A car without checkups eventually stops working, but with help, a car last forever
[04:19:31] <manicennui> You have to replace parts of the car though.
[04:19:42] <manicennui> Being able to easily replace body parts would be a good start.
[04:19:55] <manicennui> But cancers are probably the biggest problem.
[04:20:06] <manicennui> As well as decreased hormones.
[04:20:21] <Jong> what about this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacanti_mouse
[04:20:21] <ro-bot-o> [url] Vacanti mouse - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org

[04:22:20] <manicennui> Maybe.
[04:22:31] <manicennui> I think we'll probably destroy ourselves first.
[04:22:49] <Jong> when that day comes, I think death won't happen because of old age but because of accidents like getting hit by a vehicle
[04:24:57] <Jong> manicennui  are you being serious about humanity destroying it self?
[04:25:27] <manicennui> I'm mostly being flippant, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[04:25:42] <Jong> manicennui  even if there was WW3, it would just set humanity back a few hundred years if even that.
[04:25:59] <manicennui> We've never had a nuclear war before.
[04:26:12] <manicennui> I think we could easily wipe out the majority of life on the planet.
[04:26:19] <Jong> For humanity to destroy it self, there'd need to be an all out nuke attack against every continent.
[04:26:35] <manicennui> It wouldn't have to be against every continent.
[04:26:50] <Jong> alternatively, the war would need to create an atmosphere that caused global extinction
[04:26:55] <manicennui> Nuclear winter would take care of most survivors.

[04:34:16] <Jong> down to the person who launches the missile
[04:35:29] <manicennui> Jong: I don't think that it is too difficult to imagine that some country would be willing to attack Israel, including everyone in the chain of command.
[04:35:53] <Jong> I think none of those countries have nukes
[04:36:08] <manicennui> That's what I'm saying. That might not remain the case.
[04:37:46] <Jong> I'm surprised that in the process of educating oneself to be smart enough to make a nuclear bomb, the individual doesn't also obtain the intelligence to realize that religion is a giant fraud
[04:38:14] <Jong> that's another discussion though.
[04:39:12] <Jong> manicennui  what do you recommend? That I spend my life savings because otherwise it will go wasted after the nuclear war when money buys nothing?
[04:39:31] <manicennui> Just enjoy life. Don't do anything drastic.

[12:01:56] <brownorange> does irc conversations count?
[12:03:00] <causative> brownorange, and how are you going to downgrade it and all other such formulas from wff?
[12:04:12] <brownorange> causative, it's tricky, but we just ban a certain type of formula. i have other ideas, but it's worth trying the simplest approach first
[12:04:48] <causative> what makes you think it is easier to downgrade the formulas from wff than to simply add them as theorems, which we already know does not work?
[12:05:19] <brownorange> G <-> (PA -> !(PA -> G))  <-------  we want to prohibit that type of formula in the language
[12:05:43] <arryana> no.  irc is not the same as a scientific publication.  your having to ask that tells me everything i need to know about the validity of your claim.
[12:06:21] <brownorange> arrayana, i do hang out in ##math, with people who are smarter than me
[12:06:44] <arryana> so?  that's like saying going to the orchestra makes you a musician.
[12:07:18] <brownorange> no i'm playing bad music in front of the orchestra, who tells me hey that's bad music because XYZ
[12:08:04] <arryana> and you think irc #math is the same bar as a scholastic peer review.  whatever.
[12:08:21] <brownorange> no i was testing what your limits were
[12:09:06] <brownorange> well let me just be brutally honest. you don't waste the time of Scholars if you can't even pass the test of peers in your immediate inner circle
[12:10:05] <arryana> whatever, dude,  you set whatever arbitrary bar it is that makes you feel smart.  just don't tell yourself you've convinced anyone else.
[12:10:12] <brownorange> and it's a fallacy to demand proof for every observation prior to accepting the observation, observation isn't just proof, it's the thing observed.
[12:10:50] <arryana> whatever.
[12:13:03] <causative> brownorange, say you had a formal system for prohibiting all the Godel sentences of Peano arithmetic, the formal system has some way of specifying that all of those PA Godel sentences are not WFFs
[12:13:21] <causative> I don't know what that way would be
[12:14:05] <causative> what then prevents you from writing a Godel sentence for your larger formal system?
[12:14:32] <brownorange> causative if I understand your point, you can't just assume a new axiom that asserts such and such. one has to really fundamentally change what can be stated.
[12:16:12] <brownorange> i don't have a method yet
[12:16:15] <causative> certainly it is *possible* to prohibit all the Godel sentences for PA, saying they are not WFFs
[12:16:34] <causative> for example, you could eliminate all parts of PA that are not also propositional logic
[12:16:48] <causative> you would just be left with something not very much like PA
[12:17:24] <brownorange> if the sentences aren't provable anyway (undecidable), declaring them as non-wffs wouldn't affect anything i don't think...
[12:18:14] <brownorange> the bigger issue is how to help a mathematician recognize they are making a disallowed statement
[12:18:48] <causative> if you declare them as non-wffs in a *systematic* way, you might also eliminate a lot of other formulas that were previously considered WFFs
[12:19:14] <causative> and really that is the easiest way to do it - to strip away so much of PA that you can no longer form any godel sentences in it
[12:19:42] <brownorange> set theory was able to redefine what a set is
[12:20:21] <causative> really what you're saying is, what if there was something stronger than propositional logic, but weaker than PA? and unless you have such a system, it's more wishful thinking than anything
[12:21:18] <brownorange> Waiit if we already agree godel-like sentences aren't theorems, then we won't lose anything
[12:21:47] <brownorange> this isn't about discarding all undecidables, but instead just this one class
[12:22:02] <causative> the problem is how are you going to limit what you discard to *all* and *only* the Godel sentences?
[12:22:26] <causative> "X is a Godel sentence" is a very challenging proposition to determine
[12:22:35] <brownorange> all i need is a decision procedure to identify one, then the mathematician can formally ignore them
[12:22:52] *** Quits: voids (~x@user/voids) (Remote host closed the connection)

[12:24:32] <brownorange> there is no general procedure to know if a random program halts (Turing right?), but it isn't about a random program
[12:25:04] <brownorange> it's about Godel sentences, and their signature is usually obvious

[12:31:36] <causative> I don't know what G <-> (PA -> !(PA -> G)) is supposed to mean
[12:32:06] <causative> but you can't disallow all formulas that take that form without disallowing a lot of formulas that have nothing to do with Godel sentences
[12:32:25] <brownorange> but all such formulas wouldn't be provable in PA anyway
[12:34:05] <brownorange>  G <-> (PA -> !(PA -> G))   this is asserting there is some statement G where the truth of G is biconditional with it not being provable in PA (Peano Arithmetic)   . We know this because G would state specifically that i cannot be prove by PA according to PA

[12:36:07] <causative> you can be a lot more creative and weird than Godel was, if you want
[12:37:07] <brownorange> well in systems weaker than PA, you can actually get around incompleteness. and im' pretty sure its' an entirely an arithmetic things

[21:35:42] <causative> lying sociopaths rise to the top
[21:37:21] <causative> our unchecked social instincts work against the pursuit of truth
[21:38:35] <Jong> arryana  bad liars having no long term friends doesn't mean people with no long term friends are bad liars.  Not all mammals are birds, but all birds are mammals.
[21:39:08] <arryana> obviously.  nobody ever asserted differently.
[21:39:38] <causative> because, when offered a choice between saying something that is *true*, or saying something that will make others like you, people with high social engagement will choose the latter 90% of the time
[21:39:44] <arryana> and birds aren't mammals
[21:40:01] <Jong> oh whoops that's right sorry

And then gets mad when I don't understand him. Maybe it's time to look for another job
[21:46:05] <causative> google the acronyms and try to guess what he means? keep a file of what acronyms he's used in the past and what they mean? ask politely, "sorry, what does RBX mean?"? or quit

[21:50:59] <Jong> That's a weird burden shift of communicative cooperation.  Communication is a cooperative effort. It's a little snobby to communicate with the idea that it's okay to be cryptic and terse and it's the listeners job to undergo the impossible task of figuring out a message with inadequate information to do so

[21:58:01] <Jong> It's usually people in the math and sciences who enjoy playing the cryptic linguistic hide-the-ball game.  MBAs and sales guys don't.

[22:01:35] <causative> with people in the math and sciences, it may not be just a language barrier - they may just know things you don't
[22:02:21] <causative> I mean, that's also possible for MBA and sales guys, but I'm saying, don't think that just because a scientist is hard to understand, that it's his fault
[22:02:56] <causative> the subject may just require specialized language because it's several deductive steps away from everyday experience
[22:11:17] <arryana> if the issue is that your manager is using unnecessarily obscure terms, no doubt hr would deal with it.  but you'll want to make sure you're not just less than up to date on your use of terms
[22:15:44] <Jong> Is "X are all people who are Y."  inferentially opposite to "X are people who are Y" ?  Doesn't the first mean   If Y, then X ?  And the second mean if X then Y ?
[22:16:58] <Jong> "converse" I think is the technical word I meant when I wrote "inferentially opposite"
