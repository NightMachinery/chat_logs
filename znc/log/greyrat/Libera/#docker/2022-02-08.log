[01:12:35] <EdgyMC_69> Hi, are there any guidelines regarding this channel? I wanted to ask if there's a way to not write out whole container names when starting them by hand from the terminal. I know I can just write like the first 4 letters of the container id but it seems to be kind of weird that the human-friendly names are more cumbersome to use.

[01:22:46] <greatgatsby__> EdgyMC_69, are you familiar with docker-compose?  It's a nice way to define your service(s) in a yaml file, then you simply run commands like `docker-compose up`, or down, stop, start, etc. 
[01:24:17] *** Joins: hojasuelta (~hojasuelt@187.144.37.38)
[01:25:07] <EdgyMC_69> Yeah, I have heard of it and written some when doing a tutorial some years ago but currently I'm more comfortable with doing things without it. Not because it's better, I just didn't learn it properly yet and I first wanted to setup some basic servers for my toy-pipeline.

[01:27:05] <greatgatsby__> yeah, at least for me, once it's something I simply want to be able to spin up/down, start at boot, etc, I just write it as a compose file.  That being said, if you're on linux, you should have tab-completion for container names, to answer your initial question.

[06:04:14] <rawtaz> i sometimes add docker daemon config settings in /etc/docker/daemon.json
[06:05:34] <zumba_addict> me too in my mac
[06:06:00] <zumba_addict> but not sure what to add for memory to be set to 8gb
[06:06:20] <rawtaz> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/ seems to be the list of directives
[06:06:39] <zumba_addict> looking. Thanks
[06:07:07] <rawtaz> i agree. not seeing anything for memory there really. perhaps what artok said is the case, that you have to do it with a cgroup that you reference in one of these settings
[06:07:08] <zumba_addict> nothing related to memory
[06:07:28] <zumba_addict> ok, I'll google cgroup. I've never done it

[06:37:52] <ubh> what would be the best way to handle tls for dockerized nginx?
[06:38:45] <tabakhase> ubh almost not...
[06:39:09] <rawtaz> a few options: configure nginx to do the TLS / use caddy instead or as a reverse proxy in front of nginx, which has automatic lets encrypt / use traefik as a reverse proxy in front of nginx, which has automatic lets encrypt

[06:39:35] <tabakhase> you can mess around with certbot sidecars and there like... but realistically, grab a loadbalancer that knows how todo it itself in docke r(traefik or caddy for example)
[06:40:53] <rawtaz> tabakhase is right, thats much easier :)

[06:41:17] <rawtaz> personally i like traefik since it will pick up containers automatically if you configure it to do so. caddy doesnt have that afaik (unless theres a plugin for it)
[06:42:02] <rawtaz> but if you do it that way, make sure to use the docker-socket-proxy with traefik to supply a limited-access docker socket to traefik, instead of just giving it the entire socket
[06:43:54] <ubh> thanks i'll look into it

[19:03:31] <CoolerX_> why is the file getting mounted as a directory?
[19:03:56] <CoolerX_> reading this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34134343/single-file-volume-mounted-as-directory-in-docker  it seems like docker can't find the file?
[19:04:10] <CoolerX_> "It could be that you're running the "docker run" command from a client which spawns the docker container on a different host and the file being shared does not exist on that different host. The file being shared with -v must exist on the host where the docker agent will spawn the container... not necessarily on the client where the "docker run -v ..." command is executed (although they will be the same 
[19:04:16] <CoolerX_> in many cases).
[19:04:18] <CoolerX_> "
[19:04:24] <CoolerX_> ok that is super annoying, I am using the hyperkit driver of docker

[19:44:40] <tabakhase> CoolerX_ sounds a bit broky - usually either everything(under some masked path) or at least a set of specific dirs IS shared between host and vm (so in dockerdektop, toolbox and so on) -> but you used minicube right? i could see that "not doing it" as it expects you to "work with it like a k8s cluster, not a normal docker-daemon"...
[19:45:34] <tabakhase> dunno how/if, but you can likely just add that shared path somewhere in hyperkits configs if minikube rly doesnt make one *shrug*

[21:00:40] <ImQ009> Hi everyone. So, I still haven't managed to find out how to configure the proxy for Docker under WSL2 using Docker Desktop. As such, I wanted to try something else, and that is forgoing of Docker Desktop altogether and trying to use `dockerd` under WSL2 directly. However, I can't find any way to configure it to use a proxy. Is there something obvious that I'm missing here?

[21:04:42] <CoolerX_> is there one?
[21:05:29] <CoolerX_> kinda manage all of this under the hood stuff, at least when using the local docker daemon
[21:05:49] <CoolerX_> I guess podman, but that has its own set of issues
[21:05:57] <tabakhase> CoolerX_ and the key on "entrypoint and cmd" - is kinda that the entrypoint (if its a bashscript that "prepares other things" usually then has some `exec "$@"` in the end what will continue (where $@ is either CMD or if overwritten bash or whatever when doing a "docker run --rm -it image:name /bin/bash" or such
[21:06:22] <CoolerX_> ikke: so postgres there is the argument given to the docker-entrypoint.sh script?
[21:06:44] <ada_> CoolerX_: install a VM in a hypervisor of your choice.  configure file sharing for ~/.  ssh into vm and use docker, or configure your docker client on your host to talk to the engine in the VM
[21:06:45] <ikke> yes
[21:06:51] <ada_> CoolerX_: you don't need to use hyperkit specifically
[21:07:08] <ada_> CoolerX_: and in a VM, if you needed kube you could use something like k3s
[21:08:11] <ada_> or microk8s
[21:08:19] <ada_> something that runs the kube API as a binary and not as yet-another-vm

[21:09:12] <CoolerX_> I never thought I would miss Docker Desktop considering I never actually used their GUI for anything

[21:09:55] <CoolerX_> ikke: it's how I installed docker
[21:09:58] <tabakhase> its rly not much, just a handfull of different parts one need to assemble correctly ;-)
[21:09:59] <ada_> if I need docker to check something quickly, I use docker desktop

[21:11:21] <CoolerX_> ikke: I didn't have to deal with the vm in WSL
[21:11:30] <CoolerX_> probably because WSL2 is a linux kernel
[21:11:48] <ikke> It's a hyper-v vm under the hood

[21:17:14] <CoolerX_> "Command line arguments to docker run <image> will be appended after all elements in an exec form ENTRYPOINT, and will override all elements specified using CMD. This allows arguments to be passed to the entry point, i.e., docker run <image> -d will pass the -d argument to the entry point. You can override the ENTRYPOINT instruction using the docker run --entrypoint flag.
[21:17:18] <ikke> but you can also use it to turn docker containers into commands
[21:17:19] <CoolerX_> "
[21:17:21] <CoolerX_> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint
[21:17:46] <ikke> docker run --rm my-image command
[21:17:50] <CoolerX_> ok
[21:17:57] <ikke> that would provide "command" to the entrypoint
[21:18:01] <tabakhase> CoolerX_ https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh#L344 - and see how in 300 it checks "if you called docker:tag -option" and "fixes" this to `docker:tag postgres -option` -- and then in 304 it checks if first word is postgres or not (skips the init even) and 344 runs the thing
[21:18:07] <ikke> the entrypoint could then determine what it does
[21:19:46] <CoolerX_> tabakhase: ok
[21:20:12] <CoolerX_> how did you find the source btw? is there some button on docker hub?
[21:20:45] <tabakhase> CoolerX_ see kinda opposing to that, the php-cli image COULD totally just set php as entrypoint, but then you would struggle to get a bash-hell into it (cause "/usr/bin/php bash" obvs goes ham) - same would be with "docker run php:version php -f bla" would be "/urs/bin/php php -f.."  and obvs break too - so while there is no "config" happening, they still have a 3liner https://github.com/doc
[21:20:45] <tabakhase> ker-library/php/blob/master/docker-php-entrypoint
[21:20:50] <tabakhase> https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/master/docker-php-entrypoint link as one 
[21:20:52] <CoolerX_> well in this case it's official repos
[21:21:59] <tabakhase> sourced those github links? - just hit google "docker php entrypoint" :P - but ye, repos shuld be linked from the hub-pages usually
[21:22:42] <CoolerX_> oh ok
[21:22:44] <CoolerX_> Thanks

[21:53:49] <CoolerX_> I had fixed that by setting dns inside the VM      minikube ssh sudo resolvectl dns eth0 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
