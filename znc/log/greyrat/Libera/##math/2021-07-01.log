[01:39:52] <shimbles> nowadays students prefer to learn to use a reverse mode automatic differentiation library than study calculus, which makes sense
[01:40:41] <em> Probably it is because these things do not show up on standardized tests that students need to graduate, and then they are not important to typical undergraduate math majors working through those subjects that were chosen as if everyone is going to go to grad school (they aren't.)

[01:46:08] <rubiksdream> em thats one possibility, if you learn math in a BSc at a decent school, and do well, it is sort of safe to assume you can pick up the necessary skills to be a software engineer, or a banker

[06:04:14] <[itchyjunk]> How did you get either of those answers?
[06:05:25] <[itchyjunk]> you can pick one of 4 balls in one of 3 spots, 3 balls in 2 spots and 2 balls in 1 spot ?
[06:05:40] <[itchyjunk]> i guess you then multiply them all?
[06:05:57] <[itchyjunk]> hmm nm that can't be right
[06:07:10] <newpy> [itchyjunk], I'm reading Feller
[06:07:27] <[itchyjunk]> Never heard of her
[06:07:27] <newpy> it enumerates all the possibilities for 3 balls in 3 bins (27 ways)
[06:08:05] <newpy> then goes over r balls in n bins, with r=4 & n=3 having 64, and r = n = 10 having 10^10 sample points
[06:09:09] <[itchyjunk]> hm, if they were indistinguishable, 3 balls 3 bins would be 3*2*1 ?
[06:09:27] <newpy> I think it's balls^cells
[06:09:42] <newpy> if the balls were indistinguishable I could use stars & bars
[06:09:53] <[itchyjunk]> well first ball has 3 choices, second has 2 and third has 1 choice no?
[06:10:04] <newpy> second ball also has 3 choices
[06:10:07] <newpy> you can put it in any bin
[06:10:18] <[itchyjunk]> how? once i fix a ball in fist cell, there is only 2 left
[06:10:30] <newpy> no I mean draw a tree
[06:10:44] <newpy> root node is first ball, branches are cell selection
[06:10:49] <Arcorann> I checked my copy of Feller and it says 81

[06:10:57] <newpy> 3rd edition
[06:11:01] <[itchyjunk]> 81 for which case?

[06:11:37] <[itchyjunk]> Is 6 wrong for 3 balls in 3 cells , indistinguishable?

[06:13:39] <newpy> [itchyjunk], imagine a string ***||

[06:15:04] <[itchyjunk]> oh you can have more than one ball in each cell?
[06:15:10] <newpy> yes
[06:15:11] <[itchyjunk]> thought it was 1 ball per cell
[06:15:32] <mancha> newpy: you said "distinguishable" balls though, so stars-and-bars doesn't apply.
[06:15:33] <newpy> so mancha says it's 3^4, as does arcorann

[06:16:51] <mancha> you can write a 1 or a 2 or a 3 on the red ball. (the number is the bin it goes in)

[06:21:02] <newpy> so if we have 10 cells and 3 balls, isn't that equivalent to # of 3-digit numbers?

[09:06:02] <brownorange> you can create tons of variations of the monty-hall thing, unfortunately the 2/3 is correct
[09:06:16] <alystair> even looking at the excel spreadsheet it just seems... odd
[09:06:25] <arseniiv> a trivial example of that is a multiplication table and practice: going by definitions only and not deliberately practicing, one will hardly go far with good speed and usage of multiplication as a tool elsewhere
[09:06:36] <alystair> not that it's correct, but that there's no difference between a million doors and 3 doors
[09:06:53] <alystair> in terms of the odds not shifting
[09:06:56] <arseniiv> I’d say there are more transparent Monty Hall explanations than a spreadsheet, though I may underestimate spreadsheets
[09:07:10] <Vohveli> alystair: the odds are different: with n doors you have a 1/n chance of getting the right door initally, so switching has a (n-1)/n chance of picking the right door

[09:59:27] <arseniiv> about (P)RNGs: when just finite distributions are in play, like when you choose from finitely many things a finite number of times, one can model outcomes perfectly, just constructing those distributions directly; that’ll be the perfect proof, albeit for just one case if the quantities used are concrete floats
[09:59:27] <arseniiv> when we don’t choose anything and just have a value V, its distribution might be realised in a modern language as a map {V: 1}
[09:59:27] <arseniiv> if the random variable is realized as v1, v2, … with probabilities p1, p2, … then its map will be {v1: p1, v2: p2, …}
[09:59:27] <arseniiv> if we apply a function to a variable, then we just apply it to map’s keys: {v1: p1} becomes {f(v1): p1}, but summing probabilities for a key we get it more than once: when f(v1) = f(v2) = u, {v1: p1, v2: p2} becomes {u1: p1 + p2}
[09:59:27] <arseniiv> if we take two variables together, for example to apply a binary operation to them, we make a map {(v1, u1): p1 * q1, (v1, u2): p1 * q2, …}
[09:59:27] <arseniiv> if we choose with probablities p1, p2, … from variables with distributions d1, d2, … we make a large map {v: p * p1 for (v, p) in d1} ∪ {v: p * p2 for (v, p) in d2} ∪ … though ∪ here is modulo merging probabilities as in the case of applying a function above
[09:59:27] <arseniiv> finally, as a general case we might apply a function which returns not just single values but distributions, then we do it like the function case × the choice case: {w: pv * pw for (v, pv) in dist for (w, pw) in f(v)}, modulo merging probabilities again
[09:59:28] <arseniiv> then writing a class or a bunch of functions implementing that, one can easily express those of probabilistic models which don’t suffer from combinatial explosion. With some cleverness, one can take just the most probable outcomes and get rid of explosion, losing a bit in the comprehensiveness of results
[09:59:28] <arseniiv> (though specifically Monty Hall-like problems are not explody at all)

[17:11:02] <arseniiv> <chmark> Hello, how can I transform y''+(y^2-1)*y'+y-y^3=0 into a system? => did you want a first-order system like this: z = y', w = z', w + (y^2 − 1) z + y − y^3 = 0? To make a first-order system from an equation or another system, you just replace for each unknown V its derivative V' by a new unknown W in all of the equations the system has so far, add an equation V' = W, and repeat while there are still derivatives present which doesn’t have tha

[21:47:13] <alphamule> I suppose some systems can be thought of in similar ways to say, functions within some finite bounds.
[21:47:35] <alphamule> But not dealt with them as integrals so... :/

[21:48:00] <alphamule> Out of context problem

[21:48:53] <alphamule> So... something else

[21:48:59] <alphamule> You have a matrix
[21:49:04] <Batzy> yes

[21:49:37] <Batzy> well..if you figure a matrix is a linear operator
[21:49:46] <alphamule> But you want to do a partial power to get fractional rotations.  AFAIK, this is not defined (reasonably), and not even possible for many things.

[21:50:55] <Batzy> yes but the reply here says

[21:52:04] <alphamule> "Cute... But it's wrong!"  I guess it only works for stuff like rotations?

[23:18:29] <johnkeats7> yamchah2, it is true though that generically matrices have all eigenvalues distinct
[23:19:43] <buster> complex matrices, right?
[23:19:59] <em> johnkeats7: what does the word 'generically' mean when you use it that way?
[23:20:55] <johnkeats7> buster, well, generically real (and complex) matrices have all its (possibly complex) eigenvalues distinct
[23:21:01] <buster> it means almost all matrices have the property (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely>)
[23:21:24] <buster> johnkeats7: ah, shadow magic eigenvalues. fair enough.
[23:21:30] <johnkeats7> em, here it means "in a dense subset"
[23:21:43] <johnkeats7> or that the complement is nowhere dense, maybe
[23:22:00] <joel135> in this case, there is a polynomial equation satisfied by all exceptions to the rule
