[03:42:51] <foo> Not sure where to ask this question. I'm still doing a bit of searching. Anyone know of an open source system I can selef-host to share photos/videos between a group of people? Ideally web-based for Mac / Windows? Use case: A group of friends who go on trips and want to share photos afterwards with each other. (Open to channels suggestions or where to ask this, hmm)

[23:07:32] <foo> I have this: <input id="images" multiple="" name="images" type="file"> -> to allow for multiple file uploads. Is there a way to limit this to 5 files? I don't think so? eg. when someone does this on mobile, I want them to only be able to select 5 images 
[23:29:21] <stenno> not with html, you should be able to do it with JS though
