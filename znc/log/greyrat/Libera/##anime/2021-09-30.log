[00:34:07] <Jigsy> This volcano on Gran Canaria...

[00:37:06] <Jigsy> It's amazing how far it's shooting up, too.
[00:37:15] <Jigsy> It's like a solar flare.
[00:38:26] <brainwash> don't some of jupiter's or saturn's moons have massive volcanic eruptions?
[00:38:57] <Jigsy> Yeah, but Jupiter has a massive gravity field.
[00:39:17] <Jigsy> At least compared to Earth, anyway.
[00:39:39] <brainwash> it certainly does
[00:40:27] <brainwash> or is Jupiter a he?
[00:40:36] <brainwash> he certainly does?
[00:40:45] <brainwash> mmh
[00:41:15] <Jigsy> Seems a bit weird calling a planet a "he."
[00:41:35] <brainwash> !c jupiter
[00:41:37] <ImoutoBot> brainwash: Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.

[08:56:33] <ButterNoodle> I wanna fuck that dog
[08:56:56] <pteague> ButterNoodle, i loved my dog :( best explanation of his guard dog duty was my parents' next door neighbor worked for a local news station ... 1 summer they had a reporter & staff come out to her house to film for live news report ... she told them our dog would bark at them if they weren't working, but to not worry for the actual news story ... it was eerie as i was away (at school maybe?) ... he didn't bark when they were setting up, but as soon as they 
[08:56:56] <pteague> weren't working he barked at them ... the second they went live on air he was silent ... after they went off the air he barked for almost an entire hour until the next news segment where the second they went live he was silent
[08:56:57] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, have you not wanko?
[08:57:39] <ButterNoodle> its on the list Stotteren

[08:58:11] <pteague> meanwhile i was away & just watching the news segments & i couldn't tell he'd been barking at all ... between segments i think i was on the phone with my mom & i could hear him barking up a storm

[15:26:47] <amigojapan> dimwitch: do you think the time you leave shampoo in hair makes a big difference if it is long time or short time?
[15:26:49] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: you have drivers license?
[15:27:01] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: Yes
[15:27:11] <KatrinValerie> But only for smol car
[15:27:37] <dimwitch> amigojapan, it makes a difference, but more for conditioner, which needs some time to work
[15:28:35] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: the delivery for this job is done by e-bike
[15:28:39] <amigojapan> dimwitch: I don't use conditioner except when I go to onsen where it is free
[15:28:44] <KatrinValerie> I get a free workout!
[15:28:52] <KatrinValerie> Now that's what I call percs
[15:29:00] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: you get paid to get some workout
[15:29:03] <KatrinValerie> And I might even get minimum wage
[15:29:22] <KatrinValerie> That'd be more than I ever earned in my adult life.
[15:29:35] <amigojapan> dimwitch: so I can just rinse my hair from shampoo right away after lathering it?
[15:29:47] <KatrinValerie> Maybe I should go back to end user desktop support
[15:29:59] <KatrinValerie> I used to earn a lot more doing that as a kid, but doing it legal is a chore.
[15:30:29] <dimwitch> amigojapan, let it work for a bit, or even do it twice. whatever makes you happy sir
[15:30:47] <amigojapan> Gotcha dimwitch 
[15:31:34] <amigojapan> dimwitch: I want to be as happy as possible with shampoo. And I am not sure
[15:31:52] <KatrinValerie> Hair care is a really debated topic
[15:31:59] <KatrinValerie> The truth is, there is no one correct way to do it.
[15:31:59] <dimwitch> two times makes me happy
[15:32:16] <KatrinValerie> Your hairtype also plays into what you should do for your hair
[15:32:22] <dimwitch> it get more foamy and fluffy the second time
[15:32:22] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie 
[15:32:26] <KatrinValerie> And you can go different routes to keep your hair clean
[15:32:47] <amigojapan> dimwitch: ok will try that
[15:32:53] <KatrinValerie> You can wash really seldomly if you bursh a lot instead and keep the hair tied up or even covered in cloth otherwise
[15:33:07] <KatrinValerie> I would suggest sticking to your cultural standards
[15:33:17] <KatrinValerie> Or at least something that would be acceptable
[15:33:31] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: but being a chemical reaction seems we could tell if leaving it a long time would make any difference at all
[15:34:13] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: If you don't use shampoo and rarely rinse your hair, you keep it healthy with the natural fats that your scalp creates
[15:34:30] <KatrinValerie> Lot's of brushing with a really fine brush or comb keeps it clean 
[15:34:33] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie 
[15:34:55] <KatrinValerie> But your hair will look fatty initially
[15:35:01] <dimwitch> yeah
[15:35:03] <KatrinValerie> Because your scalp is used to overproducing talk
[15:35:07] <KatrinValerie> talg
[15:35:12] <KatrinValerie> what's the english word
[15:35:19] <KatrinValerie> hair grease or something
[15:35:23] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: in Mexico poor families use soap instead of shampoo on their hair

[15:38:28] <KatrinValerie> I am easily confused
[15:38:33] <KatrinValerie> tehehe
[15:38:47] <dimwitch> I am skilled at confusing people :)
[15:38:58] <KatrinValerie> I am confused skilled people at
[15:39:05] <amigojapan> dimwitch: not as much as alchohol
[15:39:51] <amigojapan> Alcohol is really confusing
[15:39:54] <dimwitch> amigojapan, you really should study alcohol
[15:40:08] <amigojapan> Alright dimwitch 
[15:40:15] <KatrinValerie> Alcohol is dangerous
[15:40:25] <KatrinValerie> When mixed with air it easily explodes
[15:40:33] <amigojapan> Yeah KatrinValerie especially methanol
[15:40:33] <dimwitch> explore all its great mysteries
[15:41:23] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: don't use methanol even as a hand sanitizer
[15:41:57] <amigojapan> Am I using the gas name again?
[15:42:43] <dimwitch> no, that's methane
[15:42:53] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: no, this one is the correct one
[15:42:57] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[15:42:58] <KatrinValerie> the alcohole you should not drink
[15:43:21] <isekaijin> KatrinValerie: Thanks!
[15:43:28] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: yeah don't even touch it. Let alone drink it
[15:43:40] <amigojapan> It will make you blind
[15:44:00] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: the antidote is ethanol ironically
[15:44:28] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: really...

[15:45:36] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Yes, I am not kidding you
[15:45:38] <amigojapan> I am still unclear if isopropyl can be used as hand sanitizer
[15:45:57] <KatrinValerie> It is commonly used as that, but you would add skin protective agents
[15:46:02] <amigojapan> It seems ethanol is the only one we can drink
[15:46:15] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie 
[15:46:16] <KatrinValerie> You can drink many of them with minor consequences really
[15:46:24] <KatrinValerie> You shouldn't though
[15:46:31] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:46:43] <KatrinValerie> In chemistry the question isn't if you can drink something, but how often you can
[15:46:45] <KatrinValerie> xD
[15:46:59] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: with most of these alcoholes it would not kill you right away unless you consumed a lot
[15:47:18] <KatrinValerie> But it is certainly very unhealthy and usually harms the liver and kidneys
[15:47:35] <dimwitch> not all poison will kill you right away :)
[15:47:53] <KatrinValerie> but a single instance of consuming say isopropanol is not going to give you serious liver damage
[15:48:01] <KatrinValerie> unless you really overdosed
[15:48:10] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: and even ethanol can cause alchohol poisoning
[15:48:10] <KatrinValerie> But just don't
[15:48:14] <KatrinValerie> Alcohol is bad
[15:48:27] <KatrinValerie> If you want that kind of buzz you can just take a xanax
[15:48:32] <KatrinValerie> much safer
[15:48:56] <KatrinValerie> But it is much better when you don't take drugs
[15:49:19] <KatrinValerie> Life on drugs is short and fast paced.

[15:50:30] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I think Xanax is much more habit forming, you said m should not recommend it lightly for getting high
[15:51:27] *** Joins: zephros (~zephros@193.32.127.226)
[15:52:47] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: it is also a prescription medicine. Which makes it illegal to buy it in other ways. So it is but like alcohol legally
[15:53:04] <amigojapan> It is not
[15:53:23] <amigojapan> Not but
[15:53:50] <dimwitch> but not
[15:54:38] <amigojapan> Witch of confusion
[15:54:45] <amigojapan> Just kidding
[15:55:57] <amigojapan> dimwitch: I forget, did you watch the witches of re zero?I think you said "not yet
[15:56:44] <dimwitch> I only watched three episodes or something like that before I stopped
[15:56:49] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Alcohol and benzos work exactly the same on the GABA system, they are equally habit forming. Alcohol just has a self limiting factor because it is also poisonous and not just intoxicating.
[15:57:10] <KatrinValerie> But looking at the stats for risks, we really should sell Xanax in grocery stores instead of alcohol
[15:57:20] <KatrinValerie> Or we shouldn't sell either there
[15:58:00] <dimwitch> they sell GABA tea
[15:58:11] <dimwitch> the effect is not the same
[15:58:17] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: pretty sure if Xanax was sold like that I would be taking a huge amount
[15:58:45] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: it's probably better that it is prescription only
[15:58:55] <amigojapan> dimwitch: there is also an English school in Japan called gaba
[15:58:55] <KatrinValerie> but really alcohol is no better
[15:59:23] <KatrinValerie> It is just culturally accepted as a drug for social occasions
[15:59:31] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I don't feel like abusing alchohol tho. But sentionics does
[15:59:45] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think it is a matter of personal preference
[15:59:46] <dimwitch> that's a different GABA amigojapan
[15:59:57] <KatrinValerie> everyone choses their poison or something like that
[16:00:46] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I don't feel addicted to alchohol, but I did to tobacco
[16:01:04] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: it is easy to not feel addicted to alcohol
[16:01:14] <amigojapan> Alright
[16:01:14] <KatrinValerie> you usually only notice it when you actively try to not drink at all
[16:01:35] <KatrinValerie> most people get at least some craving when they do that
[16:01:36] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I did not drink for 4 years
[16:01:51] <KatrinValerie> oh, after that time it usually disappears
[16:01:56] <amigojapan> Ok

[16:05:05] <KatrinValerie> when icecream is accessable to me I just eat it
[16:05:10] <amigojapan> dimwitch: maybe
[16:05:22] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: that is just a very extreme case
[16:05:25] <KatrinValerie> also 30 beers, how
[16:05:42] <dimwitch> I may have had one before, but I since have learned to avoid ice cream
[16:05:44] <KatrinValerie> I get downing a six pack of 0.5l beer bottles

[16:05:48] <KatrinValerie> or two

[16:08:39] <omero> coffee was a sort of addiction I acquired too... but I stopped it entierely. it was bad.
[16:09:11] <omero> seems interfered with my normal sleep cycle
[16:09:56] <omero> tea is better. one can mix it with rum or vodka and tastes better :)
[16:10:04] <amigojapan> omero: I only drunk up to 5pm(coffee
[16:10:59] <omero> ok, bad puns aside... I reached the point when I was drinking like 10-15 coffees per day. and not the american style ones...
[16:11:30] <dimwitch> 15?!
[16:11:31] <omero> the espresso italian ones. like injecting caffeine every 1-2hours :P
[16:12:02] <omero> dimwitch: affirmative. I said it had become a problem

[16:13:03] <dimwitch> no, but I don't drink 15 per day :D
[16:13:13] <omero> I mean... with moderation, nothing will really hurt you.
[16:13:25] <dimwitch> more like 1 or 2 a week
[16:13:36] <amigojapan> dimwitch: I drink those without sugar once in a while
[16:14:00] <amigojapan> Like once every 2 or 3 months
[16:14:02] <omero> even wine is considered a sort of tonic when you dont gulp more than 1-2 glasses during a normal dinner

[16:15:38] <dimwitch> you think you like ethanol :)
[16:15:48] <dimwitch> based on the smell of hand sanitizer

[16:16:26] <omero> de gustibus non est disputandum

[16:48:48] <omero> if your farts are sulfuric... you either had merenda on venus ... or hell :P
[16:49:06] <omero> gehenna!
[16:49:21] <amigojapan> Or in an onsen omero 
[16:49:34] <omero> vade retro demone!
[16:50:33] <omero> humans are not normally producing hydrogen sulphide dimwitch :D
[16:50:56] <Urchin[emacs]> farts are mostly methane, but that's not the smelly component
[16:50:57] <dimwitch> but they are omero, in small quantities
[16:51:29] <omero> yeah... but undetectable quantities by smell alone, right?
[16:51:39] <DunceCotus> omero: I am eating sulfur supplements

[16:52:08] <dimwitch> it depends on the person's umm, digestion
[16:52:29] <DunceCotus> sulfuric aroma isnt too bad in small doses
[16:52:51] <omero> yeah ok. H2SO4... for breakfast, instead of orange juice.
[16:53:19] <omero> its my favorite remedy for hangovers :)
[16:53:29] <DunceCotus> "NAC is a sulfur-containing amino acid – the other sulfur-containing amino acids important to human health are cysteine (which can be made from NAC), homocysteine, methionine, and taurine. A primary role of NAC is as an antioxidant."
[16:53:54] <DunceCotus> too much oxygen in my system
[16:54:01] <DunceCotus> gotta de-oxify
[16:54:05] <omero> have you considered wine?
[16:54:13] <DunceCotus> wine.. hmm
[16:54:18] <DunceCotus> may be an option
[16:54:36] <omero> depending on the variety, it might contain traces of sulfur
[16:54:42] <omero> based on the soil 
[16:54:46] <DunceCotus> imma need more than traces
[16:54:55] <amigojapan> I think egg farts smell like sulfur
[16:55:00] <DunceCotus> wine probably has traces of LSD
[16:55:02] <omero> ok. gallons of wine then :)
[16:55:19] <wikifurry-84> Question!  How do I contact someone from a different channel? (Definitely not wording that correctly )
[16:55:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah but imagine every fart is an egg fart
[16:55:38] <wikifurry-84> @flits
[16:55:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its been an interesting day.
[16:55:41] <omero> amigojapan: true. rotten eggs come to mind
[16:55:42] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus 
[16:55:56] <omero> would you feed on rotten eggs? bad idea...
[16:56:21] <DunceCotus> its not the sulfur that kills ya
[16:56:24] <DunceCotus> its the rot
[16:56:28] <ButterNoodle> COOM
[16:56:30] <ButterNoodle> its whats for dinner
[16:56:44] <DunceCotus> Mooc
[16:56:47] <ButterNoodle> where can I get cute girl to wash ur back
[16:57:26] <omero> no idea ButterNoodle 
[16:57:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you would like kusatsu onsen.kusatsu means stinky water. It smells like sulfur, some people drink it
[16:58:03] <omero> ButterNoodle: would you send one over if you find that place?
[16:58:15] <DunceCotus> "
[16:58:16] <DunceCotus> An excessive dosage of NAC over a short period of time can lead to hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure in patients with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and finally to death."
[16:58:38] <DunceCotus> gentlemen, to death!
[16:58:54] <amigojapan> NAC?
[16:59:22] <DunceCotus> N-acetylcysteine
[16:59:52] <omero> that ... doesnt sound good... DunceCotus :/
[17:00:53] <DunceCotus> omero: im not taking nearly enough to have these issues
[17:01:04] <DunceCotus> omero: but the option is there I suppose
[17:01:06] <amigojapan> omero: kusatsu onsen definitely smells like hell
[17:01:08] <omero> lungs?
[17:01:23] <DunceCotus> the issue is we have lungs
[17:01:36] <omero> mmm
[17:01:38] <dimwitch> have you been to hell to compare its smell?
[17:01:58] <amigojapan> dimwitch: probably Dante has
[17:02:13] <omero> oh... dante... a fellow writer
[17:02:16] <dimwitch> ask your demon lord for a tour
[17:02:20] <DunceCotus> I remember smelling someone's extremely eggy lunch while at a university seminar
[17:02:22] <omero> a younger fellow writer...

[17:03:17] <ButterNoodle> I ate 12 burritos with sriracha sauce, and farted for an hour straight in a garbage bag.. I put that over my head for 5 min, I couldnt imagine hell smelling any worse
[17:03:24] <DunceCotus> dimwitch: are you a cousin of darkwitch
[17:03:48] <amigojapan> Lol ButterNoodle 
[17:03:52] <dimwitch> DunceCotus, much closer than a cousin actually

[17:04:08] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: wet or dry farts?

[17:42:53] <wikifurry-84> Hia amigojapan
[17:42:57] <omero> it really depends on where you work.

[17:43:13] <ButterNoodle> KatrinValerie: tcp or udp?
[17:43:16] <KatrinValerie> The bottle neck is actually the HDD write speed, so we maxed out everything

[17:55:08] <MootPoot> that everyone had
[17:55:14] <omero> ok. spuntino and milk in the morning or early afternoon is kind of ok
[17:55:14] <ButterNoodle> maybe
[17:55:16] <MootPoot> well, at least in the US
[17:55:22] <ButterNoodle> ar15s are more prevalent
[17:55:22] <omero> lunch? HERESY!
[17:55:43] <DunceCotus> if you don't have your milk how can you drink sulfur
[17:55:47] <ButterNoodle> they are cheap and ez to customize
[17:55:51] <ButterNoodle> or real expensive
[17:55:55] <amigojapan> omero: what should you end the spuntino with in lunch?
[17:56:25] <MootPoot> do people not buy bolts anymore
[17:56:29] <MootPoot> this makes moot sad
[17:56:31] <MootPoot> I like bolts
[17:56:38] <MootPoot> its fun working it after every round
[17:56:43] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: ok
[17:56:45] <ButterNoodle> but that doods vid seems to be based on the walmart ar15 shopper that gets his upgrades from the sweatshop that makes knockoffs in china and sells them on amazon
[17:56:59] <omero> mmm... it wouldnt be heresy if you had a spuntino before or around midnight amigojapan ... mmm
[17:57:32] <wikifurry-84> What about second lunch 🤔. And third 🤔 😋? 
[17:57:55] <MootPoot> tbh isen't that like most AR-15 owners lol ButterNoodle

[18:01:04] <omero> mmm... no idea what kind of sausage. there are several kinds you know?
[18:01:21] <ButterNoodle> ig the other test is to do it from the local machine and see if ur getting the same speed KatrinValerie
[18:01:52] <amigojapan> omero: in both Mexico and America it is custom for some people to drink a hot cup of milk before sleep

[18:03:58] <omero> midnight spuntino: cookies (chocolate preferred), warm milk? 100% approved.

[18:07:52] <Sadale> amigojapan, what did you mean by Italian hell?
[18:08:23] <amigojapan> Sadale: omero is Italian and he said that that is heresy
[18:08:37] <omero> amigojapan: have friends on low carb diet that have several small meals across the whole day just for ... ahm... you know... spread across the whole day and give time to body to work on them
[18:08:45] <Sadale> ah
[18:09:13] <omero> banana as a midnight snack is not among the proper thing.
[18:09:21] <amigojapan> omero: yeah sausage and banana and milk is a small meal
[18:10:03] <omero> yes. its the choice for midnight. a specific time... but that again. depends on when you planning to go sleeping
[18:10:07] <Poeticode> whiskey in the morning, orange juice before bed
[18:10:51] <omero> lets make a practical example: when I would be working ... say... on nightshifts... midnight for me might be just ... breakfast :D

[18:12:33] <MootPoot> It's fun 
[18:12:35] <MootPoot> It's free

[18:14:38] <amigojapan> Lol omero , hopefully no sulfuric farts
[18:15:06] <omero> oh no... but... wow. impressive!
[18:15:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but I don't feel like playing modern games
[18:15:29] <MootPoot> Vrchat is modern tho
[18:16:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that at least it's less of a game and now of a social media

[18:16:20] <MootPoot> Meh
[18:17:35] <omero> I could have spaghetti as a midnight 'snack' amigojapan .... spaghetti with habanero&garlic. I would still sleep as a baby. no milk with that though :P
[18:17:51] <amigojapan> omero: isn't "flat lining"ideal for sleep?
[18:18:18] <omero> ahm... not really... but it could get technical actually amigojapan 
[18:19:12] <omero> flatlining was meant as a state of ... induced brain condition... its never good.
[18:19:24] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[18:19:29] <omero> its not proper. but renders the idea...
[18:20:10] <omero> you could get into that state for instance as a result of assuming excessive alcool... or similar stuffs
[18:20:32] <amigojapan> omero: ah gotcha
[18:21:06] <omero> but it can also be reached when you ingest food that causes an overload on the digestive functions
[18:21:38] <omero> some combinations of food can cause that.
[18:21:50] <amigojapan> omero: my spuntino last night was chiken kebab (Withought bread) and banana and milk
[18:22:17] <omero> ok. banana+milk? mostly harmless. 
[18:22:27] <omero> thats the good news
[18:22:33] <amigojapan> Ok
[18:22:37] <omero> kebab of what?
[18:22:45] <amigojapan> Chiken
[18:23:00] <omero> mmm... 
[18:23:18] <omero> that would not be a total heresy :)
[18:23:27] <amigojapan> :)
[18:23:37] <amigojapan> Low level heresy
[18:23:43] <omero> but ... wow... your tastes are a bit weird :)

[18:24:03] <amigojapan> omero: and the night before I had chorizo
[18:24:24] <omero> kebab with salade and yougurt? 
[18:24:40] <amigojapan> omero: chorizo with lots of Tabasco sauce on it
[18:25:10] <amigojapan> omero: I would have that sure
[18:25:15] <omero> eh... lol... your ancestral DNA is calling those things eh?
[18:25:24] <amigojapan> Yeah
[18:25:29] <omero> yeah!
[18:25:37] <omero> I would have that too.
[18:25:53] <omero> please, sir... can I have some more, sir?
[18:26:03] <omero> wasabi.
[18:26:19] <omero> the real stuff... speaking of sulfuric farts...
[18:26:36] <omero> now... THAT is great for producing those :D
[18:27:00] <amigojapan> I like wasabi. But I feel it is very different from chilli
[18:27:19] <omero> different principles.
[18:27:22] <amigojapan> It hits in the nose
[18:27:33] <omero> wasabi is heavily influenced by sulfur
[18:27:40] <amigojapan> Oh
[18:28:13] <omero> infact if I am not mistaken... the niponica variant is spontaneous in japan.
[18:28:37] <amigojapan> omero: what do you think of tamago kakke Gohan?
[18:28:51] <omero> why? japan is has highly volcanic soil
[18:29:01] <amigojapan> Yes
[18:30:05] <omero> jalapeño, habaneros... different stuff. capsaicina is the main principle there. nothing to do with sulfur.
[18:30:35] <amigojapan> omero: tamago kakke Gohan is a bed of rice, with soy sauce and two raw eggs
[18:30:42] <omero> no idea of what tamago kakke Gohan... looking it 
[18:31:19] <omero> I think I could like that mix, amigojapan 
[18:31:48] <amigojapan> omero: because of my low calorie diet, I have it with no rice
[18:32:04] <omero> argh
[18:32:08] <amigojapan> Just raw egg and soy sauce

[18:43:38] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: In a religious context, sin is a transgression against divine law. Each culture has its own interpretation of what it means to commit a sin. While sins are generally considered actions, any thought, word, or act considered immoral, selfish, shameful, harmful, or alienating might be termed "sinful".

[18:49:07] <amigojapan> !c seven deadly sins
[18:49:08] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings, although they are not mentioned in the Bible. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give rise to other immoralities.
[18:49:31] <omero> Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. 
[18:49:37] <amigojapan> No list
[18:50:30] <DunceCotus> do the fish feel guilty for drinking and shitting in their waters
[18:50:32] <omero> nope. they're just a broad classification outside the canonical texts

[18:51:16] <omero> its philosophical matters.
[18:52:14] <omero> but you will agree that sinning is highly subjective
[18:52:45] <amigojapan> omero: definitely most guilty of sloth
[18:53:34] <omero> in the past years, I kept around a system running some variant of Windows OS (which is already a blasphemy to define Windows an OS)... I always felt guilty to play games on those systems.
