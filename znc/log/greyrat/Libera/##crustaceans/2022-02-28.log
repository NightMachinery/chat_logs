[01:42:37] <kronk> it was more than likely my stupid ass that did it.
[01:42:43] <kronk> I did have swap enabled on the disk.

[01:43:20] <kronk> and it did happen during a swapout.
[01:43:32] <kronk> maybe it's just the swap partition that blew it up.
[01:43:39] <kronk> and the reast of the data is fine.. I fucking hope so.
[01:43:46] <epilys> Vigil itself will monitor all oaths (implorations and swears) that have been made. If an oath is broken, the offending function (the caller in the case of implore and the callee in the case of swear) will be duly punished.  How?  Simple: it will be deleted from your source code.
[01:44:25] <kronk> the first ~16.5g of the drive is just EFI and swap space, once we're past that it should be fine so long as the drive controller isn't totally fuckered.
[01:44:58] <kronk> if it is, well, it's been a pleasure. everything was on there and I didn't back any of it up.
[01:46:58] <kronk> I can still view the partition mappings, so maybe this really is just an issue with the controller and not the data.
[01:52:57] <kronk> someone with ddrescue knowledge in their head, please tell me.
[01:53:23] <kronk> I have 15314kB of non-trimmed data.
[01:53:26] <kronk> the hell does that mean.
[01:55:45] <kronk> oh..great. that means pending data to be recovered later...
[02:34:56] <epilys> kronk, can you make a disk image before everything else?
[02:44:38] <kronk> oh thank fucking god.
[02:44:41] <kronk> yeah I can see the data now.
[02:45:02] <kronk> I was able to mount the data partition.
[02:45:20] <kronk> I'm not gonna try anything until ddrescue can chew through everything else though.
[02:45:36] <kronk> I have a feeling the data is fine. you don't get flash that fails that quickly.
[02:46:11] <kronk> gonna try to re-target ddrescue at JUST the data partition.
[02:48:38] <kronk> please dear god just give me my /home folder at least.
[02:48:54] <kronk> encountering some read errors, but it was able to chew through a gig right off the bat.
[02:49:54] <kronk> 2 down, 130 to go.. thank god this thing isn't a 1tb.
[02:52:06] <kronk> yeah I have a sneaking suspicion that this thing isn't "your entire disk just failed", moreso the controller is having a bad time of getting data to and from the disk. it's all device ready errors.

[03:25:17] <kronk> well, good news and bad news. ddrescue has rescued 22% of the drive so far.
[03:25:40] <kronk> bad news is that it does look like wear and tear from swap.
[03:26:11] <kronk> the swap space is totally ruined. but the data partition hits strides of successful reads.
[03:27:08] <kronk> SMART is reporting a significant end to end failure.
[03:27:39] <kronk> says to me the controller is faulting too.

[07:07:07] <kronk> my home directory on the device is so fucked.
[07:07:23] <kronk> ironically all my system config is perfect.

[07:23:09] <kronk> if the latter part of the disk got taken out, the journal more than likely got thrown out..

[08:27:44] <kline> kronk, just to be clear
[08:27:49] <kline> are you still doing this off the failed drive
[08:28:00] <kline> or have you mirrored it to a working disk
[08:38:45] <kronk> kline: I dumped a partition of the disk to an image file.
[08:39:01] <kronk> literally just dumped /dev/sda3 to an image file with ddrescue.
[08:39:16] <kronk> now I have no idea how to actually fix the filesystem.
[08:39:28] <kronk> annnnd the disk has peaced the fuck out.
[08:40:02] <kronk> fsck.ext4 -f ./drive.img just yields "Either the superblock or the partition table is likely to be corrupt".
[08:47:10] <kronk> welp. I think I fucked the image up, fsck is asking me to delete and optimize away.. everything.
[08:47:27] <kronk> glad I backed it up before I did that. anybody got a pointer to a data recovery channel on this network, this is going to be very ugly.

[21:49:10] <kronk> I have the option of using a data recovery service, but I have a feeling the file table is just gone.
[21:49:22] <kronk> and I really don't wanna ship my personal data to these people.
[22:16:09] <pja> kronk: I settled on borg eventually. restic didn’t have either dedup or compression when I last looked. Can’t remember which...
[22:16:47] <pja> borg has some problems - not least the inability to use public key encryption for secure backups, but it ticks most of the boxes.
[22:18:35] <pja> You can get cheap offsight backups from rsync.net as well, at knock down prices. Absolutely no support however - they assume that if you’re using borg you’re technical enough to sort things out for yourself.
[22:18:52] <pja> (offsite. Sigh)
[22:20:04] <pja> Have to admit that I haven’t actually setup offsite backups yet. But I do have backups! Which is an improvement on, um, embarrassingly the last twenty five years or so of personal computing.
[22:20:37] <pja> (I did have backups of family photos etc. But not a proper system, so the backups were always months to years out of date.)
[22:22:09] <gwozniak> I currently don't have much of a backup thing at all.  But I have decided it's time to make use of an offsite backup, just in case
[22:22:20] <gwozniak> I have local backups, but I'm pretty lazy about it
[22:22:45] <gwozniak> Last one was well over a year ago
[22:23:07] <gwozniak> I wiped out a drive by accident and lost a bunch of stuff
[22:23:14] <gwozniak> For the most part, it didn't matter
[22:25:15] <Brekkjern> Honestly, rsync.net sounds a bit expensive for what you get? Isn't it like $25 per TB to begin with?
[22:25:50] <gwozniak> It's a bit expensive because you have to pay for at least 400GB, yeah
[22:26:09] <Brekkjern> https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box
[22:26:10] <buttsbot> Storage - Hetzner Online GmbH
[22:26:24] <Brekkjern> You can get 1TB for like $4 here
[22:26:41] <Brekkjern> And for the same pricing as rsync for 1TB, you can get 10TB.
[22:26:59] <indigo> How's the reliability like for a Hetzner storage box
[22:27:04] <indigo> How many replicas/etc
[22:27:19] <Brekkjern> I have no idea. I just remembered they were a thing and wanted to compare the pricing
[22:27:26] <indigo> Snapshots are neat though
[22:27:42] <Brekkjern> There is RAID on the storage too
[22:28:07] <Brekkjern> Just doesn't seem like they use server level redundancy
[22:28:55] <indigo> I guess technically rsync.net does the same, they use raidz3
[22:29:37] <Brekkjern> Hetzner doesn't say what they are doing other than that the system can deal with several drive failures and that they use something that can detect and correct bit flips
[22:29:53] <Brekkjern> That sounds like ZFS to me, but without any confirmation I don't really know.
[22:30:41] <Brekkjern> And considering this is a backup, and Hetzner is a serious company, I don't think you should be worried about your data disappearing without warning TBH
[22:33:44] <indigo> True
[22:34:16] <indigo> I love the snapshots feature, I think this is how backups should be
[22:34:23] <indigo> Just a dumb rsync and snapshot on the receiving side
[22:35:05] <indigo> How's the NO life going, Brekkjern
[22:35:37] <Brekkjern> indigo: Could be worse

[22:38:07] <indigo> That's good!

[22:40:19] <Brekkjern> Same :P

[23:28:28] <kronk> and it is unreadable, cool. RIP.
[23:35:58] <pja> Brekkjern: 1st Tb is 2.5cents / Gb.
[23:36:13] <pja> (for rsync.net, if you’re just buying borg backup space)
[23:36:43] <pja> But yes, Hetzner is also a good alternative.
[23:37:32] <pja> kronk: What drive is it?
[23:37:47] <pja> I’ve seen exactly that error with an Intel SSD.
[23:37:56] <Brekkjern> pja: Yeah, I saw the price. I'm saying that becomes $25 per TB, and Hetzner handily beats that price.
[23:37:59] <kronk> pja: it is an intel SSD.
[23:38:02] <kronk> 160GiB.
[23:38:13] <kronk> it failed with read errors just yesterday.
[23:38:19] <pja> kronk: I’m afraid that’s a) a known failure mode & b) you’re stuffed.
[23:38:21] <pja> :(
[23:38:24] <kronk> fuuuuuuuuuuuck.
[23:38:28] <kronk> got any sympathetic docs.
[23:38:29] <pja> Hope you got as much data off as possible.
[23:38:40] <kronk> yeah, I captured a whole partition and ran photorec on it.
[23:38:46] <pja> Happened to me. I reset the drive & it worked perfectly ever since.
[23:38:50] <kronk> this is a known problem? what the fuck.
[23:39:05] <kronk> is it possible to dump the NAND?
[23:39:08] <indigo> Oh man, the 8 megs... that hit one of my friends too
[23:39:11] <pja> Think it’s a firmware error of some kind - it fails to cope with data loss in the disk metadata & falls over completely·
[23:39:18] <indigo> Lost all his music projects
[23:39:19] <kronk> what the FUCK.
[23:39:41] <kronk> this is a known issue?!
[23:39:43] <indigo> Backups... I save all my important shit to the cloud
[23:39:46] <pja> kronk: A recovery company can dump the NAND, at significant expense, but that only helps if the drive wasn’t encrupted.
[23:40:03] <kronk> it wasn't encrypted.

[23:40:27] <kronk> that's from 2011, what the fuck how old is this drive.
[23:40:39] <kronk> TWENTY FUCKING ELEVEN?!
[23:40:42] <pja> indigo: That wipes the drive IIRC. I think that the drive metadata is completely gone if you see that 8Mb capacity bug.
[23:40:47] <indigo> Awww fuck
[23:40:50] <pja> I couldn’t get anything off mine.
[23:40:56] <kronk> I'VE BEEN USING A 10 YEAR OLD SSD?!

[23:41:05] <kronk> OH MY GOD.
[23:41:21] * pja eyes mailserver with Intel 320 in it.
[23:41:27] <pja> everything is definitely fine.
[23:41:35] <kronk> hold the fuck on pja.
[23:41:40] <kronk> did you experience read errors on top of that?
[23:41:48] <kronk> like, prior to the failure. did the drive just fail to read certain sectors.
[23:41:50] <pja> No, in my case the drive just hard failed with no warning.
[23:42:00] <kronk> that's what it did yesterday what the fuck.
[23:42:09] <pja> I hardware reset the thing & it came back happy. Empty, but happy.
[23:42:11] <kronk> I could still see partitions and get a PARTIAL dump prior to the death.
[23:42:16] <kronk> oh my god.
[23:42:21] <kronk> so my data might still be on this thing.
[23:42:26] <pja> It really doesn’t like having the power pulled out from underneath it IIRC.
[23:42:26] <kronk> like, in-tact.
[23:42:36] <kronk> I just need a NAND dump.
[23:42:58] <kronk> son of a bitch.
[23:43:01] <pja> You might need to know the NAND block structure as well. Not sure.
[23:43:10] <kronk> considering this is an older drive, that might be possible.
[23:43:17] <pja> Sure.
[23:43:24] <kronk> I'm going to make the assumption that the drive controller _did_ fail.
[23:43:28] <pja> I bet data recovery companies have experience with those drives by now.
[23:43:37] <kronk> and my data is still fucking there.
[23:44:09] <kronk> I wonder if there are home tools to do NAND recovery. I'm no stranger to a reflow oven.
[23:44:29] <pja> This bunch have SEOd their way to the top: https://www.datarecovery.net/hardware/intel/intel-ssd-320-recovery.aspx
[23:44:30] <buttsbot> - 	Intel SSD 320 Series Data Recovery - Solid State Drive Recovery
[23:45:43] <pja> As has this bunch: https://www.gillware.com/ssd-data-recovery-service/intel-ssd-8mb-bug-data-recovery/
[23:45:44] <buttsbot> Intel SSD 8MB Bug Data Recovery Case Study: 320 Series | Gillware Inc.
[23:46:14] <kronk> okay. well.
[23:46:32] <pja> So it’s clearly doable.
[23:46:45] <pja> Wonder if it requires desoldering the NAND chips?
[23:46:53] <kronk> I imagine it does.
[23:46:55] <kronk> fuck me.
[23:47:22] <kronk> ...actually I wonder.
[23:47:30] <kronk> is it possible to do an IDENTICAL drive swap with the NAND chips?
[23:47:55] <pja> Probably not, because the metadata is also on the NAND (usually) & that’s what’s screwed.
[23:48:01] <pja> (as I understand things)
[23:48:15] * pja is now trying to remember whether I upgraded the firmware on that SSD.
[23:48:20] <kronk> well if it's stored on the NAND wouldn't it be something to port over?
[23:48:26] <pja> pretty sure I did.
[23:49:06] <pja> Some random company on quora is quoting $300 for recovery on that drive.
[23:49:15] <pja> so, take that as some kind of baseline?
[23:49:47] <indigo> Baseline? Cells interlinked
[23:50:07] <kronk> I'm willing to spend like, $2k on this. this drive had roughly everything I've done for the past three years on it.
[23:50:08] <pja> Lots of interlinked nand cells, definitely :)
[23:50:14] <pja> Try gillware then.
[23:50:27] <pja> & don’t do anything with the drive in the meantime.
[23:50:32] <kronk> don't want everyone seeing my freaky porn, though.
[23:50:56] <pja> I imagine they’ve seen everything before. So long as it’s not illegal, they won’t care.
[23:51:01] <kronk> bahaha.
[23:51:17] <kronk> I'm still pissed that I've been using a _ten year old SSD_ for 3 years.
[23:51:34] <kronk> jesus christ if I had even bothered to check the manufacture date.. I just threw this thing in.
[23:51:36] <pja> Did you pick it up 2nd hand? The 320 is a pretty early consumer SSD IIRC>
[23:51:43] <kronk> yeah, refurb'd thinkpad t430.
[23:51:46] <pja> Ah.
[23:51:58] <kronk> was my daily driver, with a side-caddie'd 1tb ssd.
[23:52:03] <kronk> which got backed up to my NAS.
[23:52:13] <pja> Once you’ve flashed the fixed firmware, it’s a perfectly good drive, so long as you don’t hit the write limits.
[23:53:17] <pja> Older SSDs had a habit of failing hard if you hit the write limits & they ran out of spare flash IIRC. Not very consumer friendly.
[23:53:22] <kronk> once I get what I want off of this thing I'm going to shred it and burn it.
[23:53:29] <kronk> and then piss on the ashes.
[23:53:37] <kronk> and then slap myself for not taking proper backups.
[23:53:41] <pja> Not sure what modern ones are like, but they’re so much bigger it’s much harder to hit the write limits in the first place.
[23:53:55] <kronk> yeah it didn't really help that I had swap on the thing.
[23:54:05] <pja> Ah. No, that was probably a mistake.
[23:54:13] <pja> swap & SSDs don’t really mix well.
[23:54:20] <kronk> the fuck else am I supposed to use, though.
[23:54:25] <kronk> spinning rust?
[23:54:36] <pja> Fair.
[23:54:49] <kronk> the web drains every single damn megabyte it can from you these days.
[23:54:50] <pja> I guess keep an eye on total bytes written?
[23:55:24] <kronk> I wonder if the 8mb problem is just a side problem to the overall problem of "your NAND got fucked".
[23:55:27] <pja> Although tbh, my Intel SSD failed a long time before it should have on that front - IIRC the laptop battery was shot & the hard power cycles were what killed it.
[23:55:39] <kronk> yeah I've abused this thing heavily.
[23:56:07] <pja> kronk: IIRC it’s “you’ve corrupted my drive metadata, so I’m now verty confused about everything”.
[23:56:30] <pja> Intel fixed the firmware so that particular corruption issue couldn’t happen on hard power failure IIRC.
[23:56:46] <pja> Although it’s possible you’ve exceed the drive lifetime bytes written capacity.
[23:56:52] <pja> (exceeded)
[23:57:23] <kronk> gah. well.. thanks for letting me know this insanity.
[23:57:32] <kronk> I would never have bothered.
