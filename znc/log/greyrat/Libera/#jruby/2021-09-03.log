[00:35:18] <headius> enebo: pushing one more PR to update a few minor things from CRuby 2.6.8 stdlib
[00:35:36] <headius> that will mean we are current on all stdlib, gems, and dependencies except for the rdoc and fileutils issues I have filed
[00:35:57] <headius> those might have to update to versions newer than CRuby 2.6.8 if the maintainers are unable or unwilling to release the 2.6.8 diffs as their own gem versions
[00:36:11] <headius> so other than the JI issue I think we are just about ready
[00:37:40] <enebo[m]> yuck ok
[00:37:50] <enebo[m]> we definitely need to update for 2.6.8 stdlib
[00:38:02] <enebo[m]> but even if we are slightly newer on some if they won't it probably won't be a big deal
[00:38:12] <headius> the rdoc change appears to be a CVE so we have to address that
[00:38:55] <headius> the fileutils change just allows it to gracefully handle lchmod raising EOPNOTSUPP which we may or may not propagate the same way
[00:39:27] <headius> we are newer on a few others so it is not a huge deal but I wanted to poke these maintainers a bit about not keeping CRuby's copies in line with released gems
[00:39:47] <headius> we did get a rexml security update release from @kou so that is resolved
[00:42:16] <enebo[m]> yeah
[00:42:45] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6802
[00:44:22] <headius> I seem to be having a problem where milestones don't actually show everything

[00:45:10] <headius> the missing one here is the fileutils issue I just filed
[00:45:18] <headius> it is marked for 9.3.0.0 but does not show in this list, though the list shows 6 issues instead of 5
[00:50:05] <enebo[m]> DEEP AI determined you don't need that one
[00:51:03] <enebo[m]> ok I see same thing but what is the little grid thing on the left of the one check box
[00:51:25] <enebo[m]> derp just highlighted line
[01:34:59] <enebo[m]> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6803
[01:35:38] <enebo[m]> we shall see how this runs the guantlet.  I need to make more methods in all the branches but lets see this green first
[01:37:43] <enebo[m]> LOL that will teach me not to full build
[01:44:05] <headius> Hah
[01:45:08] <headius> At least it is in a PR
[01:48:40] <enebo[m]> I think this will work unless CFG.optimize has a bug and cannot be repeatedly called but so far it looks like it is working
[01:49:08] <enebo[m]> rdoc markdown found about 100 of these patterns
[05:14:33] <headius> enebo: nice
[05:14:47] <headius> stdlib update has one failure which ahorek pointed out would go away with a test update
[05:15:04] <headius> I am updating all tests to see how the new changes look but at least will get the net/ftp test updated so it is green
[05:25:51] <headius> enebo: your PR failed with metaspace errors too
[05:25:59] <headius> but the master builds have not been failing
[05:27:02] <headius> actually nevermind, one of them did fail: https://app.travis-ci.com/github/jruby/jruby/jobs/535345466
[05:27:18] <headius> I think we should bump it up a bit and see if it happens again
[08:09:58] <headius> I bumped it up on master to 768M, we will see if it happens anymore

[17:40:56] <kares[m]> finally managed to test Logstash against master snapshots - failing atm but it might be an embed setup issue on the Logstash side.
[17:40:56] <kares[m]> unfortunately I am kept low to 'proactively' look into stuff (or do JRuby work) ... guess we'll follow up after 9.3.0 once this is more pressing on Logstash.
[17:43:51] <kares[m]> interestingly the other PR (post-poned for 9.3.1) for changing Ruby thread to bubble up Java errors is smt that came out of Logstash.
[17:43:51] <kares[m]> same outcome my manager does not appreciate this ðŸ˜¥
[22:26:29] <headius> kares we can certainly ship that other PR if it is ready, I just postponed it because I figured you were busy with other things
