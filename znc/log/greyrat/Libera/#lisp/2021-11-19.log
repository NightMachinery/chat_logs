[16:28:15] <roelj> A bit of an odd question maybe, but how would one implement "with-open-file" in Python? More precisely, would it be possible to pass a function body as an argument in Python? And since I don't know how this is called, other than "a macro", if this has a name I can use to search an example, that would also be very helpful. :)
[16:28:36] <pjb>  roelj: python has lambda, but one-liner lambdas only!
[16:28:51] <pjb> roelj: the best solution is to drop python and switch to Common Lisp.
[16:29:04] <roelj> pjb: Yes, I thought about using that, but it gets weird really quickly because of the one-liner
[16:29:12] <roelj> pjb: I wholeheartedly agree :P
[16:29:18] <wasamasa> it is already implemented in python, lol
[16:29:28] <wasamasa> with open(path) as f: ...
[16:29:37] <pjb> Furthermore, the with-open-file macro is a binding macro, you give it a variable name that is bound to the stream.
[16:31:01] <wasamasa> all you need is to implement some magic methods, because that's how python rolls
[16:31:29] <roelj> wasamasa: Thanks, so, reading up a bit, one needs to implement an __enter__ and __exit__ method in a class to make the "with" thing work
[16:31:39] <wasamasa> yeah
[16:31:43] <roelj> Thanks so much, both!
[16:32:11] <roelj> It's interesting to see how fast one gets used to CL ;)
[16:32:27] <wasamasa> yeah, python leaves a bad taste after trying any kind of lisp
[16:33:31] <candlejack> it is funny, because python was created when lisp left a bad taste in the author's mouth :)

[16:37:22] <roelj> Actually, the "with" statement in Python isn't exactly what I am trying to do.. So let me try again. I have a function that takes a HTTP request object (whatever is in there is not so relevant), and I want to check a couple of things and return early, or execute ~10 lines of code. The checks are always the same, so I thought I could simply make a macro and wrap it with "with_http_error_handing" (this would be Python code, so therefore
[16:37:22] <roelj> _).

[16:39:54] <roelj> This dimension of code rewriting seems entirely missing in Python. :/ Or am I missing something?
[16:41:43] <pjb> roelj: there are decorator. IIUC, they're kind of macros.
[16:42:45] <pjb> https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/#simple-decorators
[16:43:41] <roelj> pjb: So that's returning a function from a function?
[16:44:13] <roelj> Thanks :) I appreciate the answers :)
[16:44:58] <amazigh> there is no macro in python for sure.
[16:45:15] <pjb> Something like that. But how to do something with great difficulty and restrictions, when there's a simple general solution in lisp.
[16:45:56] <amazigh> but it is unclear what you try to achieve, with-foobar is the same with with-foobar in scheme, most of the time it is done with python using `with .. as  ..`, look into try: ...; finally: ...
[16:46:05] <wasamasa> ponyorm and hy demonstrate how to implement actual macros in python
[16:46:10] <wasamasa> at great cost, but still
[16:46:17] <amazigh> +1
[16:46:42] <amazigh> but hy is another reader completly, and ponyorm, well ponyorm!
[16:46:56] <wasamasa> there's a talk explaining how it works
[16:47:01] <wasamasa> by some crazy russian dude
[16:48:18] <amazigh> but that is not the only pb with python, their bdfl has distillated a very large tribal spirit, fueled with misguided ml, and on top of that basically no open-source apps; you wonder how it made it..
[16:49:40] <amazigh> and I second the hate toward functional paradigm, and lisp; any time someone mention one of those, they get directly told the exit door.
[16:50:23] <amazigh> that is not second hand xp, I read that disregard myself.
[16:51:01] <amazigh> Also there NIH is broad and counter-productive. Another example of that, is they never mention prior art in other programming languages (except typescript)
[16:51:26] <amazigh> sorry off-topic.
[16:52:11] <roelj> This makes me wonder.. Is there something similar to parenscript, but then to transpile to python? Then I don't have to deal with it anymore.. ;)
[16:52:34] <amazigh> to paraphrase their slogan "python the ultimate glue language" is the anti-thesis of single-language system.
[16:52:51] <amazigh> roelj: hy
[16:53:03] <amazigh> https://docs.hylang.org/
[16:53:13] <pjb> I just translated a 50 loc python script into a single line of bashâ€¦
[16:53:33] <pjb> As ultimate glue language, there's some progress remaining to be madeâ€¦
[16:54:48] <amazigh> there is something that does require PLT or Scientific scrutiny, join #python watch the convo for some time... 
[16:54:58] <pjb> Honestly, even with the bad syntax (spaces, etc), I don't have a bad a-priori to python.  It's a OO language, there's matter to do something nice with it. But even compared to ruby, I don't feel like python achieves anything good.
[16:55:49] <amazigh> well, they are missing some spirit that both CL and other lisp have DIY and lisp curse.
[16:56:05] <pjb> Nowadays, first you have to spend 50% of your python time determining what version of python, and what set of libraries dependencies, before you can start digging into it.

So the caller would invoke a constructor for the proposed object and the callee would extract the two values in order to use them.
[18:36:26] <mdhughes> But the user has to haul around the type of each dictionary? Thus losing the very point of type-specific functions it's supposed to cure?
[18:38:34] <jcowan> If a function takes a procedure argument like -map or -for-each, that argument traditionally comes first: it's (map proc list). Consequently, the dict version is (dict-map prooc list).
[18:39:23] <mdhughes> What users would want: (dict-ref foo 'key) and don't care what foo is. What nobody wants: (dict-ref hashtable-dict-dtd foo 'key)
[18:40:07] <mdhughes> The proc can be up front, as long as the dict & dtd are together. It's splitting them, or even having two fields, that's a problem.
[18:40:53] <jcowan> You can't just look at foo and figure out what it is.   Haskell does that with static typing, and OO languages with inheritance.  Neither of which we have.
[18:41:22] <jcowan> (Haskell actually uses DTDs under the covers.)
[18:41:50] <mdhughes> (cond [(list? d) list-dtd] [(hashtable? d) hashtable-dtd] ...)
[18:42:00] <jcowan> s/inheritance/polymorphism
[18:42:25] <mdhughes> and then once you hit the user-defined classes, cache the rtd in a hashtable.
[18:42:37] <jcowan> That's fine if you have a fixed list of dictionary types, but we expect it to grow.
[18:43:21] <mdhughes> If only there was some concept where you could have a registry of types, like CLOS or symbol properties or hashtable caches or, huh, a bunch of other ways to do that.
[18:43:25] *** Quits: thomasb06 (~thomasb06@leat141.unice.fr) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:44:28] <mdhughes> I have my own half-assed anyref, anylen, etc. functions that work exactly that way, but they're unoptimized. Presumably if it can be defined at language level it'd be faster.
[18:44:34] <jcowan> All of those amount to global data structures, the dangers and disadvantages of which are well known.
[18:44:43] *** Joins: mononote (~mononote@user/mononote)
[18:44:46] <mdhughes> Types are already global.
[18:45:19] <jcowan> Types are predicates, which are not global.
[18:45:42] <mdhughes> Barring some weird cases of runtime-defined records, and those are presumably fine to put in thread locals.
[18:46:57] <jcowan> You are assuming that a dictionary is always a record, but alists are not.
[18:47:14] <mdhughes> "(cond [(list? d) list-dtd] ..."
[18:47:48] <mdhughes> Obvs don't use list?, use pair?
[18:48:31] <jcowan> We also have plists.  (The current draft doesn't have them for reasons having to do with mutation: you can't mutate the empty plist, because it's ()
[18:48:34] <jcowan> )
[18:49:56] <mdhughes> plists and alists are easy enough to distinguish, at least in the case "someone passed a list to this dict function". Does it (pair? (car ls)) - alist, else plist.
[18:50:14] <jcowan> Unless it's empty.
[18:50:33] <mdhughes> OK, and there's no mutation on an empty list, so they're functionally identical.
[18:51:47] <mdhughes> What happens if you (dict-add '() 'key 1)? Pick one, '(key 1) or '((key 1))

[18:52:46] <jcowan> add is functional, so no problem.  add! is a problem.  Fortunately, alists are normally used functionally.

[18:55:04] <jcowan> Currently every DTD is either pure or impure, and you have to use the right functions without or with !.  This is both messy and an annoyance, but my judgement is that it's overcome by the ability to make changes at all.
