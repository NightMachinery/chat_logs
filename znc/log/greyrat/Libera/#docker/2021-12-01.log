[01:58:44] <acegallagher> ok.. I'm trying to run seafile in docker on arm64 and I'm having all sorts of problems. the current problem is getting numpy installed
[01:59:06] <acegallagher> I have numpy via py-numpy package, but when I import numpy I get the classic "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy.core._multiarray_umath' "

[02:04:44] <acegallagher> both sides?
[02:05:18] <s17> I had some modules installed when I had Python3.9 on my system.  When I upgraded to 3.10, certain things no longer worked.

[02:08:30] <acegallagher> I'm installing py-numpy via apk-add
[02:08:38] <acegallagher> and it puts a module in /usr/lib that I can import
[02:08:42] <acegallagher> but that doesn't import properly
[02:09:07] <acegallagher> and throws the ""Importing the numpy C-extensions failed.""
[02:09:51] <s17> check where the module was installed and compare it to the python version
[02:10:03] <acegallagher> it's in the proper 3.9 directory
[02:10:16] <acegallagher> but I think, by asking here, I nudged myself in the right direction
[02:10:19] <s17> my modules were in python3.9/site-packages, but the system was running python3.10
[02:11:56] <acegallagher> yeah.... what weird

[02:38:40] <ravindUwU> ada_, is that the only distinction between the two?

[02:38:52] <tabakhase> those are kinda different things... but not rly

[02:39:19] *** Quits: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious) (Quit: Leaving.)
[02:39:40] <ada_> docker desktop runs a vm which runs docker, and there are lots of userspace tricks to make it work like it's part of your windows installation
[02:39:44] <ada_> on linux, those pieces aren't there
[02:39:49] <ada_> so, do you consider those differences?

[02:57:42] <jim87> hello! I was wandering... I've got a docker container which exposes a port. I'd like to access to its port, but not publishing the port on the host's machine (accessing thus only from the host machine using the docker's network IP)... is it possible? Thanks :)
[02:58:24] <programmerq> if you want to access a container from anything other than another container, you want to publish a port. You can publish to the host's 127.0.0.1 so that only the host can access it if you'd like.
[02:58:47] <programmerq> some network drivers do set things up such that the container IPs are routable, but it isn't a planned/expected aspect of the docker networking model.
[02:59:33] <jim87> @programmerq what if I have several copies of this container, and I want to access to all of them, without figuring out which port docker opened fo me?
[03:00:13] <programmerq> if they are webservers, you can put them all behind a common reverse proxy and access them by name
[03:00:24] <programmerq> otherwise, you would have to map ports for each one.
[03:00:44] <programmerq> what is it that you want to access from the host?
[03:01:45] <jim87> spark workers, that are managed by a master node, which have links like http://172.26.0.3:8081/

[06:42:49] <tabakhase> what command exactly? - and do you get this spit in the terminal, or shows up in syslog or so?
[06:43:16] <Kilroy> systemctl start docker and that is coming from the /var/log/syslog

[19:24:05] <ignorand> Hi all
[19:24:40] <programmerq> trebuhâ–¸ the docs.docker.com site is the docker project itself. if the docker project doesn't ship binaries for a given distro, that's what it means. If that distro ships its own binaries, then that may very well be a decent option for you.
[19:24:52] <ignorand> how can I link 2 containers with each other I assumed that if I have 2 servies in a docker-compose I get auto name resolving to the other container and i'm able to connect to the other container without exposing a port
[19:25:34] <programmerq> ignorand any container on the same docker network can resolve the other container by the name and connect to anything that is listening on that other container.
[19:26:13] <ignorand> programmerq, aah, found the issue. my web was with networkmode: host
[19:26:42] <programmerq> yup, host mode networking basically turns off all the docker networking features and those processes are just like any other process on your host (from a networking point of view)
[19:26:47] <rawtaz> programmerq: were you able to reproduce it (considering you talk about going to strace it)?
[19:27:35] <mickey8> programmerq take your time, it's nothing critical
[19:27:43] <programmerq> rawtazâ–¸ I am pulling the image. I'm on a pi2, and my architecture shows up as armv7l so it may not be a great test. doing strace date inside and outside the container should tell you what the binary is actually doing and whether the raspbian binary is doing anything different.
[19:27:53] <programmerq> oh interesting! reproduced.
[19:28:24] <rawtaz> cool :D
[19:28:51] <ignorand> anyone know how to check if my php code gets send from apache to the php container?
[19:29:31] <ignorand> not sure if I need to install fast_cgi on the httpd docker image
[19:30:01] <programmerq> there's a php image variant that has apache available.
[19:30:26] <ignorand> programmerq, would you recommend that over apache seperate and php seperate?
[19:30:53] <programmerq> it depends on your goals and your project's requirements.
[19:31:07] <programmerq> personally, I'm a fan of nginx and a separate fastcgi process in its own php container.
[19:31:09] <rawtaz> ignorand: what is it you want to do/run in the first place? please start there instead of specific questions that are misinformed
[19:31:24] <rawtaz> (it doesnt make any sense waht you wrote, php code getting sent from apache to the php container)

[21:46:21] <tabakhase> ZMarkC you have to publish the end thats getting called - then extra firewalling generally not (cause its forwarding, not actually accessing your host, so it kinda bypasses most general rules people would have) - exceptions to this obvs. apply

[22:08:20] <burakcank> which is - volumes: - ../.postgresql_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
[22:10:16] <programmerq> historically, the volumes key would create the directory on the host if it didn't already exist. I know with the new mount interface, it'll complain if it doesn't exist which is desirable in some situations, and is arguably more ideal since a remote dockerd doesn't necessarily need to have dockerd create directories on random locations

[22:56:13] <ada_> most of the time VOLUME isn't strictly necessary unless you have an I/O performance reason to use it, like I might do it on a mysql database /var/lib/mysql because I don't want the negative IO performance of the copy-on-write filesystem
