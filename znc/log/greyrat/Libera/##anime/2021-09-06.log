[00:54:07] <Bco1981> no, the first Keekihime youtube stream
[00:54:27] <isekaijin> Nanobot: Are Hololivers allowed to show their real selves? Or what do you mean by RL?
[00:54:54] <Bco1981> isekaijin: no they are not
[00:55:32] <Bco1981> atleast not with the hololive brand or character name
[00:55:32] <Nanobot> isekaijin: They can sorta show themselves as long as their skin/hair isn't visible. Haachama does a lot of cooking streams where she's wearing gloves.
[00:55:59] <Nanobot> I remember some Hololive member accidentally showed her uncovered hands recently. I forget who it was.
[00:56:10] <Bco1981> yeah me too

[01:25:07] <Vohveli> Bco1981: iirc the first time was when they were cooking something together, second time when she accidentally turned on a camera
[01:25:15] <Vohveli> I just hope she's careful
[01:25:57] <Bco1981> yeah, webcams are scary... and easy to knock over.
[01:26:42] <Vohveli> probably a good idea to block them physically whenever they're not being used
[01:26:51] <Vohveli> for everyone, really, not just vtubers
[01:27:32] <vegii> what do you mean, on macbook you'd get the red flashing light when it's on, right? no need to tape it over
[01:27:50] <vegii>  /s
[01:28:31] <vegii> also, that's why I love the mechanized, retracting camera on my xiaomi 9T phone
[01:28:43] <Bco1981> vegii: a misclick in your obs, and you show the real webcam
[01:29:17] <vegii> oh, now I'm having flashbacks to using msteams and OBS crap
[01:29:41] <Bco1981> remeber to wear clothes
[01:30:39] <vegii> and loading a kernel module enabling v4l2 loopback so I could use chroma key
[01:31:13] <vegii> I should buy a green screen fabric
[01:31:54] <vegii> one that's just big enough to fill entire frame without relying on OBS to crop the webcam feed
[01:32:20] <vegii> or maybe I should get a 2x barlow lens for the webcam

[09:33:07] <ButterNoodle> just use screen
[09:33:07] <Macer> just using thunderbird because i never used it as a client so i figured i'd check it out and see what it does

[12:57:00] <ImoutoBot> lastonestanding: A cargo ship or freighter is a merchant ship that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world's seas and oceans each year, handling the bulk of international trade.
[12:57:06] <lastonestanding> no
[12:57:10] <lastonestanding> not one of those
[12:58:48] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: it would take forever
[12:59:26] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: cruise ships used to be a thing
[13:00:01] <lastonestanding> some people are afraid of air travel
[13:00:52] <amigojapan> An intercontinental cruise ride costs like 15000usd
[13:00:55] <emmeka> the Pacific ocean is sort of stupidly massive
[13:01:26] <lastonestanding> emmeka: one could go the other way too, no?
[13:01:33] <emmeka> ...what?
[13:02:04] <emmeka> you mean Japan to US by traversing the Indian Ocean, the Suez, the Mediterranean and then the Atlantic??
[13:02:20] <lastonestanding> kinda
[13:02:27] <emmeka> I mean yes but that's an even more absurd distance.
[13:02:38] <lastonestanding> and north?
[13:02:44] <lastonestanding> too much ice there?
[13:02:45] <emmeka> ...........north?????
[13:02:50] <emmeka> the arctic ocean????
[13:02:55] <lastonestanding> oh yeah
[13:03:28] <emmeka> you realize that 1) the arctic ocean is frozen over, completely 2) to do this you would have to transit the Pacific and cross the Bering strait at Alaska anyway 3) this would take you to Canada, not the US.
[13:04:07] <lastonestanding> during summer is probably not that frozen
[13:04:13] <emmeka> it's very frozen.
[13:04:27] <emmeka> even the northwest passage cannot be transited in summer without icebreakers
[13:04:31] <lastonestanding> isn't Alaska mostly ice free during the summer?
[13:04:38] <lastonestanding> with 20C and more?
[13:04:47] <lastonestanding> mmmh
[13:04:51] <emmeka> yes... the parts that are on the Pacific coast....
[13:05:00] <emmeka> the parts of Alaska that border the arctic ocean are tundra.
[13:05:39] <emmeka> the part of Alaska where people actually live is just temperate rainforest like most of the Pacific coast

[13:07:32] <amigojapan> I think travel by ship is a thing of the past now. Especially with what happened to cruise ships during covid
[13:08:24] <lastonestanding> you mean that cruise ships died?
[13:08:55] <emmeka> lastonestanding the presence of northern lights doesn't make it not temperate rainforest, since the northern lights occur at high lattitudes not due to climate... but Fairbanks is an exception, it's inland, which is weird for Alaska.
[13:09:12] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: there were covid outbreaks in navy cruise ships
[13:09:18] <emmeka> so it has a continental climate like most boreal forest areas
[13:09:31] <lastonestanding> emmeka: interesting
[13:10:20] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: but there were covid "outbreaks" everywhere
[13:10:24] <emmeka> it's not like northern lights only happen in the arctic, they happen here...

[13:12:00] <emmeka> I live in what people would call "the north"

[13:13:02] <emmeka> lastonestanding when you're asking whether I "know GTA", do you mean the Canadian metro area or the video game.
[13:13:18] <lastonestanding> the metro area
[13:13:34] <emmeka> I'm not sure why you'd ask me if I know my own country's largest city, but yes.
[13:13:35] <lastonestanding> I learned just some days ago what GTA means
[13:13:58] <lastonestanding> you mean that ever canadian know that?
[13:14:15] <emmeka> yes?
[13:14:19] <lastonestanding> okay
[13:14:26] <lastonestanding> but outsiders apparently don't know it
[13:15:18] <emmeka> Toronto is by a significant margin the largest city in the country, and is also a self-important one. Torontonians are stereotyped as being convinced that Toronto is all that matters, and having an event horizon that ends at the city's suburbs. It's basically impossible to avoid dealing with.

[21:36:56] <Nanobot> It's never happened to me until this year.

[21:39:11] <isekaijin> Even then, it is kind of rude, me thinks.

[22:41:42] <JesseDesu> the truth is
[22:41:54] <JesseDesu> i dont think coasters are useful for anything
[22:43:39] <emmeka> they are if you have hardwood furniture.
[22:44:55] <JesseDesu> still
[22:45:04] <JesseDesu> it works with or without one
[22:45:20] <JesseDesu> emmeka, i watched 2 eps of adachi
[22:45:30] <Bco1981> yes, forever you will see. it works fine without it...
[22:45:52] <JesseDesu> makes me wanna become a gay high school girl
[22:46:13] <emmeka> JesseDesu the ring of water your glass leaves behind will eventually damage a nice hardwood table
[22:46:30] <Bco1981> and the ring will sink in
[22:47:06] <emmeka> I mean if you have cheap furniture made of fake shit, then w/e. But I have a lot of nice antique hardwood stuff and it gets coasters.
[22:48:30] <JesseDesu> hmm
[22:48:40] <JesseDesu> i guess i dont give a fuck
[22:49:00] <JesseDesu> i have a hardwood computer desk
[22:49:20] <JesseDesu> it sees plates and mugs
[22:49:33] <JesseDesu> and beer cans/bottles
[22:51:42] <JesseDesu> !seen ButterNoodle 
[22:51:42] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: ButterNoodle was last seen in ##anime 2 hours and 33 minutes ago: <ButterNoodle> it will need to better than my miku model

[22:52:32] <JesseDesu> i dont get the alien component of adachi and shimamura
[22:52:43] <JesseDesu> is that like, a metaphor
[22:52:54] <JesseDesu> for a conscience
[22:57:07] <Nanobot> English is weird. Homework is different from housework, which is different from dwelling work.
[22:57:26] <emmeka> like I said JesseDesu, don't worry about it. the anime never gets to the parts of the series where it matters.
[22:57:42] <emmeka> Yashiro is just there for now, and unimportant
[22:59:51] <JesseDesu> yashiro is the alien?
[22:59:58] <emmeka> yeah.
[23:01:06] <Nanobot> Humpty Drunkty walked into a bar. Humpty Drunkty didn't get far. All the king's horses and all the king's men told Humpty not to come back here again.
[23:01:32] <Nanobot> He got smashed
[23:03:44] <Nanobot> When they read The Three Little Pigs in Japan, do they still include the line, "Not by the hair on my chinny chin-chin"?
[23:04:26] <JesseDesu> save it for the super chat
