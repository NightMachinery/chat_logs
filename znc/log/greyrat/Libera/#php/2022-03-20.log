[00:11:57] <Albright> So I have a project where I need to find certain terms in text and auto-link them to a page.
[00:12:32] <Albright> I did this with a regex which was basically /(term1|term2|term3|â€¦)/ (more complex than that but basically that)
[00:12:54] <Albright> But now the client wants to find and linkify so many terms that the regex is too long and doesn't compile anymore.
[00:13:47] <Albright> Trying to think about what my other options are here.
[00:15:09] <Albright> The reason why I'm using regex in the first place is so I can use lookaround to see if there's white space or punctuation around the term so I'm not matching on a partial term, match for both curly and straight apostrophes, etc.
[00:17:58] <Albright> I guess just building one simple regex per term instead of trying to cram them all into one massive one might be the best way. Not sure if there's a significant speed difference between the two.
[00:18:19] <da_wunder> that sounds silly, but I would just use `str_replace(['foo', 'bar'], ['link-to-foo', 'link-to-bar'], $sometext)`
[00:18:35] *** Joins: Alex123 (~Adium@cpe-76-89-231-189.socal.res.rr.com)
[00:19:04] <da_wunder> I'm assuming that your client is making that `$sometext` so don't guess what is there, build clear rules and tell those to your client
[00:19:04] <Albright> Well, like I said, I have some requirements that mean I can't use simple str_replace()
[00:19:27] <da_wunder> what are those "some requirements"?
[00:19:56] <Albright> > The reason why I'm using regex in the first place is so I can use lookaround to see if there's white space or punctuation around the term so I'm not matching on a partial term, match for both curly and straight apostrophes, etc.
[00:20:35] <Albright> So for "bar" I want to match it in "foo bar." but not "foo barbell."
[00:20:39] <da_wunder> I would not start to cover those at all - just say your client that those are not supported and that's it
[00:20:57] <Albright> Not an option. :)
[00:21:12] <Albright> In fact it would be a regression from what's already been working for them for several weeks now.
[00:21:55] <da_wunder> then create rule class for each of your use cases - and in those classes use some regex to solve that _single_ use case

[00:24:59] <Albright> If by that you mean just create a separate term for each pattern, yeah, that's what I'm ending up doing.
[00:25:30] <da_wunder> exactly that
[00:25:42] *** Quits: mintoyatsu (~mint@user/mintoyatsu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:26:05] <da_wunder> and with those I would recommend to use eg. `supports` method, to check if that class can handle that text or not

[00:49:51] <daoumilseitek> Albright: sounds a bit like a search engine index
[00:50:08] <daoumilseitek> try tntsearch maybe ?
[00:50:32] <Albright> Well, I guess the "search" part is similar
[00:50:48] <Albright> but I don't need to do indexing or anything.
[00:50:49] <daoumilseitek> https://github.com/teamtnt/tntsearch
[00:51:08] <daoumilseitek> idk, finding them & linking the pages where it is found is an index
[00:51:26] <Albright> ?
[00:51:37] <Albright> By "link" I mean an HTML link.
[00:51:56] <daoumilseitek> a url or path to the page yes ?
[00:52:02] <daoumilseitek> unique
[00:52:08] <daoumilseitek> that's an index
[00:52:13] <daoumilseitek> just like in a book
[00:52:40] <Albright> No, I mean I need to replace "foo" with "<a href="/path/to/foo">foo</a>"
[00:53:06] <daoumilseitek> ooooh you mean make a link
[00:53:18] <daoumilseitek> not just "link them" as in collect links
[00:53:47] <daoumilseitek> more like in wikipedia then ?
[00:54:19] <Albright> Right, but no custom syntax. The link is automatically made by presence of the term.
[00:54:35] <daoumilseitek> regex is a thing, but regex around xml can become painful
[00:54:53] <daoumilseitek> i'd use a dedicated xml lib
[00:55:36] <Albright> Already got that part solved. I just load the HTML into a DOMDocument, traverse it to find all text nodes, then operate on those.
[00:57:11] <daoumilseitek> ok then sorry for interruption you're likely on the right track
[00:57:52] <daoumilseitek> multiple regex will be slower but won't  overload the ram

[04:27:44] <Hash> Hi
[04:27:50] <Hash> I forgot how to run the profiler in php
[04:28:10] <Hash> I have xdebug setup https://bpa.st/HAQQ and here is my xdebug config
[04:28:18] <Hash> I just forgot it's been 2 years since I used php
[04:28:42] <Hash> I need to generated a cachegrind output file to look at in kcachegrind in kde
[04:29:58] <Hash> Does it generate a profile each time the request comes in to the app or does it need to be started specifically somehow
[04:31:05] <Albright> Hash: With xdebug.start_with_request=no, you have to manually trigger a grind being created IIRC.
[04:31:12] <Hash> https://xdebug.org/docs/profiler
[04:31:21] <Hash> Yeah, I'm brushing up as well
[04:31:38] <Hash> Oh right, I did set that years ago. right. I am blind
[04:31:40] <Albright> I think if you set it to "yes" you should get a file with eahc request
[04:32:16] <Hash> I don't think I want that. Do I? I need to test a specific function to see why it takes such a long time. I have a hunch and I'm trying to speed that function up by refactoring the logic
[04:32:41] <Hash> If the sql table has like thousands of rows, I'm fetching each row one by one, for small tables it works fine but for large ones it takes a long time.
[04:33:00] <Albright> I don't know if you want that. :P But if you don't, set it to "trigger" and then you can send a certain GET or POST value to create a file.
[04:33:07] <Hash> I wonder.
[04:33:34] <Hash> What if I fetch the whole 80mb table into memory as php array, and then use php to process it
[04:34:17] <Hash> https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#mode
[04:35:05] <Blondie101010> "thousands" of rows is a SMALL table
[04:35:28] <Blondie101010> test your query separately
[04:35:38] <Blondie101010> if it performs well, continue profiling
[04:36:11] <Hash> I can't remember how I ran the profiler with xdebug.start_with_request=no
[04:36:15] <Hash> still set
[04:37:19] <Hash> I guess Ic an't.
[04:37:33] <Hash> Whatever, I'm brushign upa gain.
[04:37:38] <Hash> You can still start a Function Trace with xdebug_start_trace(), Step Debugging with xdebug_break(), or Garbage Collection Statistics with xdebug_start_gcstats().
[04:38:16] <Blondie101010> sounds like the way to go
[04:38:51] <Blondie101010> I don't use xdebug
[04:42:59] <Albright> I'd highly recommend using it.
[04:43:10] <Hash> xdebug.start_with_request=no
[04:43:38] <Hash> I changed this to yet, restarted nginx, and php fpm, then I made a request to app and I don't see a cachegrindout file in /tmp
[04:49:26] <Blondie101010> Albright:  I am not against debuggers, but prefer using traces in most cases, and debuggers aren't convenient for my work
[04:49:42] <Blondie101010> for a quick profiling, I might do something awful like: https://3v4l.org/nidT7
[04:50:00] <Blondie101010> just copy-paste the ugly profiling line everywhere :)
[04:50:35] <Blondie101010> at this point, I'm thinking I should use a function with a static variable
[04:50:44] <Blondie101010> it would look better :)
[04:50:56] <Albright> barf
[04:51:15] <Blondie101010> you get quick information
[04:52:06] <Blondie101010> that's especially useful when you apply it to code blocks
[04:52:17] <Albright> I guess it depends on what you need, but I wouldn't want to use an approach like that for something complex.
[04:52:22] <Blondie101010> just to find out what part is taking longer
[04:52:33] <Hash> Oh nm
[04:52:53] <Hash> I had missing packeges, nginx was loding 8.0 and cli and had 8.1, I had to also manually install 8.1 fpm
[04:52:56] <Blondie101010> I'd agree it's not the proper solution to just optimize the code
[04:53:46] <Blondie101010> but to answer Hash's question it would be faster than getting xdebug to work :)
[04:55:09] <Hash> cool. I can u se a trigger now again. I must have put no to turn it off cuz profling is n';t neede all the tim

[04:57:59] <Albright> No.
[04:58:47] <Albright> Now did you try to load the user data from the database from within the template? That would be a case of stuffing "business logic" in the template.
