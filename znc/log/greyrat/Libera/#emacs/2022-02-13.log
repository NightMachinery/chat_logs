[00:51:53] <jklsemicolon> So, I found EXWM a bit ago and I've been playing with it. In practice, how much of a liability have others found Emacs's single-threaded implementation when using it as a window manager?
[00:52:08] <artefact> none
[00:52:28] <technomancy> jklsemicolon: it really just depends on how much sketchy elisp you use. if you use well-behaved packages you won't have any trouble.
[00:52:46] <Kolev> Someone needs to make EXWL.
[00:53:04] <technomancy> Kolev: for wayland?
[00:53:09] <Kolev> Yeah, technomancy.
[00:53:10] <technomancy> I would pay a lot of money for someone to make that
[00:53:15] <artefact> i'm not sure you realise what the X in EXWM meant ;-)
[00:53:23] <jklsemicolon> Awesome, thanks. The sketchy elisp is what I write.
[00:53:26] <Kolev> But I would also pay a lot of money for someone to make Emacs multi-threaded.
[00:53:52] <technomancy> jklsemicolon: sometimes when I'm testing elisp I write I just spin up a nested emacs and it's fine; just have to not forget
[00:53:58] <technomancy> it's pretty seamless
[00:54:10] <artefact> unfortunately writing a wayland compositor is so much amount of boilerplate. i doubt a pure elisp solution is even possible

[04:06:17] <dale> I guess it gets angry when I try to mess with its repos, so for example I have at least two copies of my own org-mode repo (I have some patches on org-mode).

[04:07:30] <nnnnn> I wrote that feature :)
[04:07:34] <nnnnn> I co-maintain straight.
[04:07:49] <grym> it'd be nice to have a :commit, probably
[04:07:56] <grym> but otherwise, i have no complaints about straight
[04:08:05] <nnnnn> I've since abstracted straight-bug-report into https://www.github.com/progfolio/yodel
[04:08:26] <nnnnn> grym: agreed
[04:08:59] <nnnnn> grym: I've implemented a general :ref keyword on my personal fork, but it's incomplete. I use it with Yodel, though.
[04:09:31] <dale> nnnnn: When I was trying to make some changes in the local repo that straight cloned, it would see that I had diverged from the copy I have on GitHub and "just ignore it and use the local version anyway" wasn't an option, IIRC.  It's been a while.  I just learned "don't do that".  There were also some problems because my init.el (which is public on GitHub) specifies the repo location for org as
[04:09:33] <dale> https://github.com/... whereas I need the remote set to git@github.com:... when I want to be able to make changes to my repo, and straight doesn't like the clone having a different remote from the recipe.
[04:10:04] <dale> nnnnn: All in all it's "straight's repos are straight's repos and either make things consistent (recipes, working tree, remotes, etc.) or do your development in your own repo".  It was a very minor adjustment, once I kind of understood what was going on.

[04:10:49] <earthToA`> bremner yeah

[04:11:01] <dale> Yeah, I would bet that when it actually has to wrap a bunch, that's going to slow down every Emacs, everywhere.
[04:11:44] <dale> nnnnn: Actually, I forgot one complaint from my early days of using straight: at the time, at least, I don't remember the docs have a very clear answer to "how do I update all of my packages".  I understand how to do it now, of course.
[04:11:47] <earthToA`> But it's not just slow. It's more like an epileptic fit!

[04:12:29] <grym> at one time at least there was a mirror involved
[04:13:03] <nnnnn> dale: I'd have to see the exact use-case, but in general straight should leave your repos alone. It will ask you to resolve the state of the repo when updating or thawing, though. I have maintained my own personal fork of org. Usually just keep things on a branch and point the recipe to that. Merge upstream changes as desired.
[04:13:38] <earthToA`> shrysr with mine, it's like the scroll bar starts fighting with me, and it keeps bouncing back to where I left it...
[04:13:43] <nnnnn> dale: The documentation is a tad much. It needs to be re-written.
[04:13:53] <dale> Here's how I got AUCTeX to build with straight (I... think): https://github.com/dsedivec/dot-emacs-d/blob/master/init.el#L135-L145
[04:15:08] <dale> nnnnn: I think the problem is I share my fork between multiple machines, so I keep it on GitHub, but sometimes I've updated the local copy without force-pushing to the remote, and straight notices the discrepancy.  Not a problem now that I just do the rebasing and pushing in a separate clone. :)

[04:40:45] <nnnnn>  spikemaster: It is built as packages are downloaded. Similar to straight.el, you declare package "recipes" in your init file. Those get queued up and cloned in a subprocess.

[04:50:45] <nnnnn> earthToA`: I'm not sure what you mean by backend server. The entire thing is implemented in ~1500 lines of elisp.
[04:51:10] <earthToA`> nnnnn Wait, what?
[04:51:24] <nnnnn> spikemaster: Not public yet. I'm still working out many of the details. I will dogfood this for a bit before realeasing it.
[04:52:36] <nnnnn> spikemaster: There's not much magic in detecting dependencies. I clone the repository and read either the pkg.el file or the "main" elisp file's Package-Requires header. Managing them once we know what we want to install is a little tricker, but not much.
[04:54:02] <nnnnn> earthToA`: I guess, I shouldn't say it's entirely elisp, it relies on git to clone and do some operations on repositories and pre-existing tools to compile/install info. But is mostly elisp.
[04:54:17] <nnnnn> *it is mostly elisp.
[04:55:45] <earthToA`> nnnnn Ahhhhhhh.... okay, I'm reading your README on Github.
[04:57:17] <nnnnn> earthToA`: If you're familiar with straight.el, the idea is similar.
[04:57:21] <spikemaster> nnnnn: ah. I know a few packages that have sort of hidden or "optional" dependencies not listed in ;Package-Requires.  Like Markdown-mode "soft" depends on edit-indirect package.
[04:58:36] <earthToA`> nnnnn I'm curious how "Edit packages by editing their code, no extra steps required." works...
[04:58:44] <bae> my daughter asks: does anyone use Emacs in Space?
[04:59:07] <earthToA`> nnnnn I mean, if you edit the source file and the package gets updated, then what?
[04:59:08] <bae> ...as in Outer Space
[05:00:00] <spikemaster> earthToA: with package.el you can literally edit the elisp, but it will just get lost the next time you update the package. Packages are sort of treated like "immutable blobs" despite being source code.
[05:00:05] <earthToA`> bae Hahaha... you're not a contributor to Spacemacs are you? :)

[05:01:29] <earthToA`> spikemaster so with package.el, if I want to change something, I'm looking at advising functions to preserve my edits... is that workflow different with straight?
[05:02:02] <nnnnn> earthToA`: The way straight.el works, is you download the source repository directly. Editing the source files will trigger a rebuild of the package the next time you restart Emacs (or when manually invoked). This allows you to easily make changes and commit them upstream to your own forks (from which you can make pull requests to the package author).

[05:02:36] <spikemaster> earthToA: with straight.  (or just manually cloning a repo)  the source code is treated as source code.  You can make edits and they are permanet. You can make your own private branch, and merge in changes from upstream and your personal changes last forever.

[05:10:01] <nnnnn> straight is more in the realm of getting the package downloaded, built, and activated for use. It just does it in a way that makes it very easy to modify the source code and contribute upstream.

[05:14:03] <nnnnn> earthToA`: straight.el is a great package manager. Radon and I have put a lot of work into it. I'm hoping to improve upon that with the next package manager, but it will be awhile yet before that's ready for realease.
[05:14:21] <johnjaye> earthToA`: i'm terrified that people don't constantly reinvent the wheel
[05:14:30] <johnjaye> because it means in the future when we need wheels people won't know how
[05:14:35] <earthToA`> nnnnn why "the next" PM and not just version 2.0 of straight?

[05:15:34] <nnnnn> johnjaye: That's a fair point and I encourage people to start from scratch just to see if something can be done differently.
[05:15:49] <johnjaye>  it's more about the tower of abstractions
[05:15:58] <johnjaye> abstraction A is build on B built on C. and people only really understand the top of it
[05:16:48] <wgreenhouse> emacs packaging really isn't very abstract. ,,install,, stills work just fine
[05:16:49] <fsbot> install: [0/5] To install a <file>.el, save it to e.g. ~/elisp
[05:16:49] <fsbot> [1] add to the beginning of ~/.emacs: (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

[05:17:04] <earthToA`> johnjaye that's unavoidable. The human brain only has so much room. How many people today know how to use a... slide rule??
[05:17:05] <fsbot> My sources say no!
[05:17:06] <nnnnn> earthToA`: straight.el has a lot of users and made strong promises for stability. I don't want to neglect those promises. I also have some different goals with this package manager.
[05:17:18] <earthToA`> let alone... Emacs!! :D
[05:17:26] <johnjaye> earthToA`: yeah but we rely on the things in that tower so there's no real escaping it
[05:17:35] <johnjaye> like libc then Xlib then Xt then GTK etc
[05:17:55] <johnjaye> so if GTK one day wasn't suitable or had to be replaced, you might have to go 3 layers down the stack to start the new thing
[05:17:58] <johnjaye> that's my issue
[05:18:01] <johnjaye> people don't think in those terms
[05:18:53] <spikemaster> i wonder how easily the human knowledge to build microchips could be wiped out.
[05:19:07] <johnjaye> that's basically what i'm getting at. i read an article i wish i could find it again
[05:19:10] <nnnnn> wgreenhouse: Sure, basic installation of basic packages is simple enough. Some packages require more.
[05:19:23] <johnjaye> but it was about chip making and programming and basically how people only really have to knowledge of how the latest technologies work.
[05:19:32] <johnjaye> and the technologies those things depend on people are kinda clueless about. i wish i saved it lol
[05:20:01] <nnnnn> johnjaye: Jonathan Blow often makes the point you're making. There's definitely some validity to it, but as earthToA` points out, it's unavoidable to a certain degree.
[05:20:43] <johnjaye> sure but so are earthquakes
[05:21:00] <johnjaye> it doesn't mean you don't have a seismometer and an alert system and try to build buildings better
[05:21:51] <nnnnn> johnjaye: I agree, but I'm you have to draw a line somewhere. There's a practical cost to knowledge.
[05:21:58] <johnjaye> like that whole power grid failure in texas a while back. the weather was anticipated and all the companies were working hard to prepare for it the week before
[05:22:17] <johnjaye> it was just so unimaginably cold for so long all thier calculations went bust and the entire state was 5 minutes away from total collapse
[05:22:48] <nnnnn> Sure. A solar flare could take us back a few hundred years pretty easily.

[11:55:43] <contrapunctus> Has anyone here read about the Third Time system? It speaks of "working hours", and they seem to include breaks (and "big breaks", such as mealtimes). Does that mean there's only a single range of working hours in the whole day? (...making it more like "waking" or "active" hours than "working hours"?) Or does it make any sense at all to specify multiple ranges?

[19:57:14] <euouae> I'm reading a long file and I want certain sections to stand out, because they're the important ones
[19:57:26] <euouae> maybe fold the unimportant stuff?
[19:57:43] <corwin> euouae: based on a search? (maybe try M-x occur) or how would you find the "important" bits?
[19:58:17] *** Joins: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico)
[19:58:45] <corwin> euouae: you might want to look at `outline-minor-mode'
[19:58:48] <euouae> I know what the important bits are
[19:58:56] <corwin> right, but how will Emacs know?
[19:59:02] <euouae> I don't know
[19:59:17] <euouae> e.g. I'd like lines 10-100 and 200-300 to be shown and the rest hidden
[19:59:45] <corwin> see if `outline-minor-mode' does anything for you.  If not, we could talk about cobbling together some custom logic
[19:59:56] <euouae> thank you. I'm going to read up on it
[20:00:15] <irek> euouae: You need to use `highlight-regexp'
[20:00:44] <euouae> OK looks like outline-mode requires to modify the file, which I don't want
[20:01:01] <corwin> irek: don't we need a search pattern to use highlight regexp?
[20:01:02] <euouae> and highlight-regexp seems to highlight stuff based on a regexp; I want to hide/show ranges of lines
[20:01:35] <irek> euouae: for that i recommend fold-this package
[20:01:51] <euouae> nice, thank you irek
[20:01:53] <irek> You can fold and unfold any selected region
[20:02:16] <corwin> irek: Is that on GNU ELPA?  Sounds cool, I haven't run across that one..
[20:02:58] <irek> With vanilla Emacs you can easily only narrow to region, but hiding selected parts it's not that easy.  fold-this package is great and I would like to have something like that build in.
[20:03:00] <euouae> it says it's in melpa
[20:03:16] <euouae> here it describes it, https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Folding#Fold_this_region
[20:03:45] <euouae> irek, it'd be especially nice if the folds stay when the file gets reopened. Do you know if that is true?
[20:03:48] <corwin> I think hideshow could be another option if you want to play with builtin stuff first.
[20:03:51] <treflip> euouae: outline-minor-mode doesn't modify the file
[20:04:02] <euouae> treflip doesn't it require you to use headings with *?
[20:04:26] <euouae> I can't insert headings into a source file
[20:04:36] <corwin> treflip: I think they are saying they would need to modify the file to get the structure expected by o-m-m.  That said, could try something with an indirect/cloned buffer..
[20:04:39] <treflip> euouae: you can customize the regular expression used for "detection" of headings
[20:05:04] <corwin> but again, that's going to need a pattern and I think they said it should be line# driven..
[20:05:09] <irek> euouae: no it doesn't remember anything.  You would have to use special file format that would encode additional information other than text, or use separate file to remember in which file what region was hidden
[20:05:15] <euouae> It's not what I'm looking for treflip, I would need to hide based on line number/ranges, not regexps
[20:05:29] <euouae> irek, hmmm, interesting. I bet that can be quickly hacked
[20:06:05] <euouae> but of course, now I'm hacking emacs again instead of doing the original task I wanted :D
[20:06:17] <irek> euouae: but what you could use to remember stuff is "session".  You could store Emacs session and restore it after you open Emacs again.  It will remember many things about your open buffers.  But in that case you can't close your buffer
[20:06:47] <irek> ha, just another day in Emacs :D
[20:07:09] <euouae> That's a great idea. I should probably use sessions instead of hacking it for now
[20:07:46] <irek> fold-this + session might be just what you need

[20:14:01] <corwin> tyson2: looking at the README, you might need to arrange for Emacs to be able to find imagemagick, which isn't generally needed by Emacs 27.1 for most image stuff (e.g. sizing and rotation).
[20:14:42] <corwin> Emacs >=27 I should say
[20:14:43] <euouae> irek, seems like I'm entering poweruser territory with eev. But I'll give it a go :D
[20:14:43] <tyson2> corwin: that's what I recall as well.  I'm considering switching to running emacs on wsl2, which would simplify things
[20:15:16] <tyson2> imagemagick has been problematic recently as I recall
[20:15:46] <corwin> tyson2: be curious to know what you think.  I hated it and also running under cyg b/c it seemed way slow, but things may well be better now, especially if you have native-comp going.

[21:19:42] <`2jt> Hi, I'm using emacs 28.0 and flycheck underlines with red color as well as highlights the word where error is. I've found how to modify the underline style however I cannot find how to remove the word highlighting itself. This bothers because if I try to select that word I don't see the selection color but instead that "error highlight color". Underline would be enough.

[21:57:32] <mattroelle> Hi there. I am trying to get justinbarclay/parinfer-rust-mode working and am a bit stuck. I have (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages/parinfer-rust-mode") (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode 'parinfer-rust-mode) in my init.el, with the repository cloned to that location. However when I open an EL file, nothing happens. I am quite new to emacs and am not sure where to begin debugging
[21:58:24] <mattroelle> I know that this library requires a .so file to be present, I have also built parinfer on my system and placed the library file where instructed, no change there either. The plugin also advertises that it will prompt for a download and doesnt? which makes me think its not even getting loaded

[23:07:48] <corwin> It's been over two years since I removed java from my win10 machine and I haven't missed it at all.
[23:09:04] <bremner> I went the other way. Kept java, removed windows.
[23:09:13] <lampilelo> :D
[23:09:17] <bremner> not that I love java.
[23:09:39] <corwin> is it hard to run, e.g. debian without depending on java?
[23:09:47] <bremner> no, not really
[23:09:53] <corwin> oh good
[23:10:10] <bremner> I think the only thing I need that depends on java is jitsi-meet

[23:13:12] <fsbot> well...at least it's better than PHP
[23:13:17] <bremner> exactly
[23:14:13] <shrysr> Nevertheless it appears Java and now fortunately python - are the most popular. I had my first exposure to java in the last 1.5 years at $work... coming from a python/R scripting bg - it has been a challenge to get into a class for everything.
[23:15:29] <grym> usually it's a challenge breaking people of that particular habit coming the otherway
[23:15:45] <grym> "oh look a class of @staticmethods; must be a java programmer"
[23:15:47] <bkhl> Mm, I've dealt with some unfortunate Javaesque Python.
[23:16:11] <shrysr> how do you mean javaesque python ?
[23:16:14] <grym> just because you _can_ write java in any language doesn't mean it's good
[23:16:28] <shrysr> jython ?
[23:16:29] <bkhl> Excessive dependency injection for the sake of it etc.
[23:16:46] <grym> one day jython might die; that'd be okay
[23:17:13] <grym> there was some poor schnook in #python last month maintaining something in jython 2.4
