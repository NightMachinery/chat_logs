[02:38:44] <pinoaffe> aight, I thought so
[02:39:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It does however also lack the control flow equivalent one can find in CL

[02:40:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not sure best is how I'd phrase it.

[02:44:54] <pinoaffe> rk4: I mean, both goto and call/cc have their use cases in my opinion, though the code I was planning to write with call/cc would be very cursed indeed
[02:45:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> tagbody does it better.
[02:45:45] <Catie> goto in C is block-scoped, right? I'm pretty sure it is, but it's been a while
[02:45:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Catie: Yes.
[02:46:09] <rk4> i think it has most to do with dogma myself!
[02:46:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You have to use longjump for interfunction.
[02:46:42] <Catie> Yeah, that's what I was thinking, thank you
[02:47:09] <Catie> So how does goto differ from tagbody then? Given all of that, my understanding is that they are equivalent
[02:47:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Catie: Mostly clarity of syntax.
[02:47:22] <pjb> Catie: they're function scoped.
[02:47:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So I guess you could say I'm just ragging on C.
[02:48:12] <Catie> Aurora_v_kosmose: C's syntax is indisputably worse than any Lisp's, that's a given
[02:48:36] <rk4> quite.
[02:48:53] <Catie> pjb: so you can't isolate a goto with an inner block, whereas tagbody creates its own scope?

[03:27:08] <kiki_lamb> Is there a function that moves the cursor to the next non-whitespace character? Usually I skip around lines with forward-word and backwards-word, but those skip past some characters, such as parentheses.
[03:28:29] <kiki_lamb> Would save me a keystroke hitting backward-char sometimes if I could just skip to the next non-whitespace character without moving past those characters.
[03:30:42] <TRS-80> kiki_lamb: I think there is either some variable to define what constitutes a "word" or else maybe look for "subword" function

[12:45:16] <wasamasa> what are you talking about again?
[12:45:22] <wasamasa> evil is on MELPA
[12:45:36] <pingpongball> i thought elpa
[12:45:38] <wasamasa> it is everywhere except on GNU ELPA
[12:45:53] <wasamasa> MELPA is not GNU ELPA
[12:46:52] <pingpongball> i hope it doenst track anddont have proprietary wares, i'm fine, somebody would notice
[12:47:08] <wasamasa> lol
[12:47:20] <wasamasa> you should educate yourself a bit first before making these nutty claims
[12:47:50] <pingpongball> not claim but just saying ,:)
[12:48:09] <wasamasa> I mean everything in that conversation so far
[12:48:44] <pingpongball> :)    yes, i'm uneducated, i left school , broke.
[12:49:08] <pingpongball> I again came here for client server , which is just not working
[12:49:18] <pingpongball> it is working, but something wrong
[12:50:21] <kilobug> pingpongball: to summarize, for something to be included in GNU Emacs, it needs copyright assignment to the FSF so the FSF can enforce the GPL (among other things); packages that are under a Free Software license (very often GPL) but don't have copyright assignment to the FSF are not in core GNU Emacs, but are available on melpa and easy to install on it
[12:50:52] <pingpongball> oh, i got thanks.
[12:51:24] <pingpongball> so evil-mode needs copyright assignment to the FSF.
[12:51:42] <wasamasa> not really, nonGNU ELPA is a thing
[12:51:47] <wasamasa> you can install it from there
[12:52:11] <wasamasa> starting with the next emacs release, both GNU ELPA and nonGNU ELPA are going to be included by default
[12:52:31] *** Joins: theoceaniscool (~theoceani@119.12.232.133)
[12:52:35] <wasamasa> so you can just install it without setting up MELPA
[12:52:47] <pingpongball> :)    i'm in 29, i think it is included
[12:53:44] <wasamasa> MELPA used to be lax with regards to licenses, but they fixed that
[12:53:54] <wasamasa> non-compliant packages have been adjusted/removed: https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/5498
[12:54:30] <pingpongball> Guys,
[12:54:30] <pingpongball> What is your most known useful thirdparty package in emacs , that makes your emacs so much productive, while coding?
[12:55:17] <winny> okay i'll bite, magit keeps me productive in my git workflows.  it cuts out 95% of the typing i'd do on the command line to do the same things
[12:55:35] <pingpongball> ah, i also use that:)
[12:55:39] <thblt> top three would be magit, lsp, vertico+orderless+embark
[12:55:57] <thblt> (yes the latter three count as one because I decided)
[12:56:27] <pingpongball> yes, it is also included:)
[12:56:56] <thblt> The very first thing I add to a raw emacs is completion with fuzzy matching, 
[12:56:56] *** Joins: Xenguy (~Xenguy@user/xenguy)
[12:57:52] <thblt> Yes if you use Doom you're probably not going to need much more than what's built-in.
[12:58:22] <pingpongball> how you think of nano emacs
[12:58:43] <thblt> vanilla, otoh, is, erm, the polite word would be “backwards compatible”.
[12:59:25] <pingpongball> emacs is perfect for keyboard, but i feel gui of emacs is dull, dont you also think that?
[12:59:39] <pingpongball> It need to be improved in gui too.
[12:59:46] <thblt> You mean the menu and toolbar?
[13:00:33] <kilobug> I always disable the toolbar and very rarely use the menu, I'm all keyboard-oriented (well, I use a tiling WM, and apart from Emacs and Firefox, 95%+ of what I do is in tty)
[13:01:22] <pingpongball> i think the whole thing, it feels lag, dont you also feel like that.
[13:01:23] <pingpongball> like when you scroll in sublime text, it feels so smooth, completion in vscode is cool,
[13:01:41] <pingpongball> although they tends  to take so much ram, and emacs with less ram, but
[13:02:15] <thblt> Emacs doesn't have real continuous smooth scrolling, but I wouldn't say it lags. Completion is backend-dependant.
[13:03:17] <kilobug> never felt emacs to be laggy when scrolling, even when I torture it by using it through xpra as I do sometimes
[13:03:22] <thblt> (re scrolling: I mean that it jumps from line to line, instead of “panning” over the view like the rest of the world does)
[13:03:41] <kilobug> I don't like smooth scrolling, I disabled it on firefox
[13:03:52] <thblt> I've had bad slowdowns with LSP, I suspect some sort of leak.
[13:04:03] <pingpongball> What have you done to remove that ?
[13:04:04] <pingpongball> i see sublimity package, i tried to use that but it got more lag
[13:04:05] <kilobug> probably just a matter of habbit, I'm from an era where that didn't exist, and I'm not used to it

[13:05:11] <pingpongball> oh
[13:05:17] <thblt> I believe they meant smooth scrolling, not GUI.  You'd have lived without smooth scrolling if you've used a computer before the 2ks I guess?
[13:05:34] <winny> there is a built in emacs profiler that can tell you where it's spending most of the slowdown time
[13:06:10] <pingpongball> Is there people here who never used vim key bindings in emacs
[13:06:19] <pingpongball> and stick with default

[13:07:07] <thblt> Well the defaults are fine.  I can't say I've never played with Evil, but I only use the defaults.
[13:07:15] <winny> i use fairly vanilla emacs keys in emacs, but will happily use vi/vim if asked
[13:07:28] <pingpongball> as soon i learned evil mode, i've never come back and look default.

I set dictionaries and company backend using the following code: https://0x0.st/-Rmu.txt, but it doesn't work with company-ispell. I see only English completions.

[17:31:40] <ngz> codingquark: there's a limitation on newline characters allowed in the regexp used to match emphasized text. By default, it is 1. IMO, it should really be lifted.
[17:32:00] <codingquark> ngz: that is interesting!
[17:32:14] <ngz> See `org-emphasis-regexp-components' for reference.
[17:32:47] <codingquark> I imagine having `+' signs all around will cause random things to be shows with strike-through if I happen to, say, use it in equations etc
[17:32:52] <codingquark> Thanks
[17:33:42] <ngz> Probably. You may want to work around this by striking-through piece wise, i.e., multiple times per paragraph. This is sub-optimal, tho.

[23:30:27] <Lenbok> I have a novice macro question. I have a macro that helps build other functions (https://github.com/Lenbok/scad-dbus/blob/master/scad-dbus.el#L88). When I eval the expressions that use the macro, all is good. But now I'm loading the code via package manager (straight), the macros (e.g.
[23:30:28] <Lenbok> https://github.com/Lenbok/scad-dbus/blob/master/scad-dbus.el#L108) haven't been executed. Do I need to wrap the macro calls up in something?

[23:36:14] <wasamasa> as opposed to munging several expressions together and using backquote where regular quote would suffice
[23:36:34] <Lenbok> pjb So is my problem the macro rather when I'm invoking it later?

[23:37:16] <festerdam> Hi, all. I'm kinda new to Emacs, but I've already grasped the basics in its use. Of course I want to use Emacs to its full potential, and something I hear many people praising is org-mode. I tried searching a bit more about it, but I haven't found any clear explanation of what it is. By the descriptions it seems to simply be a word processor. Am I wrong in my understanding?

[23:37:52] <Lenbok> pjb I was interactively writing / evaluating until it had the effect I was after (that probably is why the quoting is weird too).
[23:38:02] <pjb> Lenbok: this is not how one should programm.
[23:38:14] <grym> festerdam: org-mode is a todo system / personal knowledge tracker /... ; not really a word processor 
[23:38:33] <pjb> festerdam: it's several things. It's based on a simple markup syntax, to give structure to documents.
[23:38:45] <pjb> festerdam: then there are tools build on those structured documents.
[23:38:59] <Lenbok> pjb Yeah :-)
[23:39:05] <wasamasa> Lenbok: why not write a macro definition that expands to a defun invocation you want to have?
