[04:07:42] <anton>  hey
[04:07:46] <isf> <M3RELATIVISM[m]> working on hyperbola at the moment > hyperbola continue GNU but with the BSD kernel right?
[04:07:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> indeed
[04:08:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the idea s to modularize openbsd kernel
[04:08:23] <isf> <anton>  hey > how are you, hacking a lot?
[04:08:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> to the point anyone in GNUlinuxland
[04:08:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> can use it
[04:08:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> as a alternative to bloaty cusin linux
[04:09:09] <anton> yes
[04:09:29] <isf> <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the idea s to modularize openbsd kernel > so the name can be Hyperbola GNU/bsd right?
[04:09:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is the idea and we are trying to get funding for it
[04:10:01] <isf> So cool!
[04:10:04] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> isf: not really because not all GNU packages will be used
[04:10:13] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> others can use if they want
[04:10:20] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> GUIX and parabola for instance
[04:10:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> we will not use vanilla GNU coreutils for instance
[04:11:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> we will use GNUcoreutils fork by openbsd project
[04:11:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> etc
[04:11:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hyperlibc
[04:11:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> our own gnulibc fork to run on our openbsd modularized fork
[04:11:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hyperbk
[04:11:49] <isf> 18<20M3RELATIVISM[m]18> we will use GNUcoreutils fork by openbsd project > and what's the name of that fork of GNU?
[04:13:11] <isf> <M3RELATIVISM[m]> our own gnulibc fork to run on our openbsd modularized fork > oh, interesting a modify version of GNU but still GNU right? is just a technical issue for make it compatible with the new free kernel?
[04:13:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> isf: is not a fork of GNU as a whole
[04:13:52] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just GNUcoreutils
[04:13:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> one of the many GNU packages ;)
[04:14:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "is just a technical issue for make it compatible with the new free kernel?" indeed
[04:14:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the idea is also to upstream all this work
[04:14:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so others can benefit from it
[04:14:56] *** Joins: tpefreedom (~theodore@user/tpefreedom)
[04:15:29] <isf> <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the idea is also to upstream all this work > looks like a big work
[04:16:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> not really given we are building upon what other have done already
[04:16:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so trying not to reinvent the wheel here
[04:16:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so like for deblobing libertyBSD scripts will be used has refrence
[04:16:41] <isf> <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "is just a technical issue for make it compatible with the new free kernel?" indeed > cool, that can help to others distros to in the future have other option more than the linux-libre
[04:16:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is for hyperbk
[04:17:06] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> then for hyperlibC alot of work has been done on this in debian
[04:17:16] <isf> <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so trying not to reinvent the wheel here > important
[04:17:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by people working on debianknetbsd
[04:17:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and debiankfreebsd
[04:17:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and the for hyperrc gentoo people have also work on this
[04:18:15] <isf> looks like a big clean
[04:18:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the lastone is hyperman, also arch people and gentoo as well have worked to port pacman and emerge to openbsd ports 
[04:19:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "option more than the linux-libre" that is the whole objective of the project
[04:19:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> upstream upstream upstream
[04:19:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so others can also benefit from our project
[04:20:14] <isf> 18<20M3RELATIVISM[m]18> so others can also benefit from our project > looks promising

[06:43:28] <epony> OpenBSD is free and open and secure and reliable, you can use it even without middle-ware manipulations from the HNU, because that invalidates the quality and reliability and security of the system, middle-parties tamper and degrade the system qualities
[06:44:04] <epony> the Hyperbola project is a waste of time (false rebranding)
[06:44:48] <epony> it violates the inalienable parts of the recognition of authorship and authenticity of software from the OpenBSD project
[06:45:44] <epony> such a thing is just "riding" other projects for publicity with no real benefits other than marketing and hype-donation rent-seeking
[06:46:12] <tpefreedom> epony, HNU?

[06:52:47] <tpefreedom> epony, what would honesty look like in this situatiion in your opinion?
[06:53:32] <epony> call it OpenBSD with GNU extras
[06:54:07] <tpefreedom> maybe openbsd + GNU/Hyperbola?
[06:54:15] <AwesomeAdam54321> "the condition that source code must be distributed when the program is distributed for all works that are under the GPL license..it is a condition that is typically unacceptable for commercial use of software" Can you elaborate?
[06:54:16] <epony> but you can't since it's not OpenBSD when you manipulate it (you can't provide the same qualities and reliability, since you're not the original authoring group)
[06:55:15] <tpefreedom> so forks reduce quality?
[06:55:38] <tpefreedom> Is GNU+Linux (or what many people call Linux) too fragmented?
[06:55:38] <epony> in this case it does, since you can't keep up to the metrics and frequency of work
[06:57:20] <epony> you just don't take other projects releases and strip the name and call it something else ;-) that's just not free software authoring but false distribution
[06:57:49] <epony> you can't claim you wrote it, that's misleading people
[06:58:32] <tpefreedom> What about all the arch baseed distros that are basically just a preconfigured version of arch with a graphical installer? Are those misleading?
[06:58:33] <epony> and when they come to you for support you won't be able to provide it, since it's not your original work, so you depend on the upstream.. thus people will be bypassing you immediately prior to installation
[06:59:08] <epony> I don't know about then, they are something else and their licensing is their own thing.. you'll have to ask them.
[06:59:53] <epony> I just have read the BSD licensing and speculate on the natural outcome of project forking in the BSD licensing model.
[07:00:11] <epony> the BSDs don't sue ;-)
[07:00:20] <epony> the users will judge you though
[07:00:44] <epony> (at least on tecnical merit)
[07:01:00] *** Quits: dot0 (~dot0@user/dot0) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:01:53] <epony> I personally think license violations are a minor offence, it's just a matter of recognition and decency to not stir and mix up things above reuse and clearly defined dependencies.
[07:02:10] <epony> as in "not misleading" and "proper historic" outline
[07:02:47] <epony> the quality and reliability however are primary points of concern of highest priority
[07:04:17] <epony> it also does not matter for "what you do on your own computer at your own premises".. so is just a matter of public recognition when redistributing work that is your own versus other people's work and taking royalties and recognition for that (misattributing and profiteering)
[07:04:43] <epony> I think OpenBSD is a permissive licensing model, so you can technically do even that..
[07:05:22] <epony> you just can't claim it's you who created and maintains and releases OpenBSD 
[07:05:41] <epony> something like that ;-)
[07:06:28] <epony> why is there a situation, it's just some project accepting OpenBSD as a vendor of high quality software and perusing it for their own project activities
[07:09:25] <anton> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Vendor
[07:10:00] <epony> you're a vendor of philosophy and now censor words in people's mouths ;-)
[07:10:23] <epony> seems quite authoritarian and dictatorship worthy newspeak fanfare
[07:10:35] <anton> I'm not censoring anything
[07:10:38] <epony> doubleplusgood vendorshipmentship
[07:10:56] <anton> I'm just linking to a page on the website for the channel we're in
[07:11:15] <epony> whatever, you can't replace a word in my sentences
[07:11:18] <epony> they are mine.
[07:13:08] <epony> political parties and political activity groups do this kind of thing, totally not the point of software and computing
[07:13:36] <epony> software tampered by politics is politicalware and not worthy of technical evaluation
[07:13:49] <epony> since it is nonfree and manipulative
[07:13:55] <epony> get it? ;-)
[07:16:14] <epony> the point was: when you take a software release to reuse, you're a downstream redistributor of other project and other people original work which become your vendor of software
[07:16:47] <epony> that's called "upstream"
[07:16:52] <epony> or source
[07:17:01] <epony> and you become "downstream"
[07:17:11] <epony> or redistributor
[07:17:45] <epony> when you change it, misleading other people that it's the original you become a manipulator
[07:17:48] <epony> or fraudster
[07:19:16] <epony> so you become a vending automat that misleads others it's vending original work that is tampered
[07:20:57] *** Joins: isf (~iShareFre@fsf/member/iShareFreedom)
[07:21:57] <epony> that's the violation of the "inalienable" authorship and breach of (non-retained) authenticity, which is typically ensured by keys, signatures and checksums to validate the distribution path of source to recipient tamper-proof
[07:23:13] <epony> it might have been a problem in the 90ies and preventable with physical media shipment but not any more with the network only distribution model

[19:36:46] <frost-core> i accidentially licensed my distributions components (such as build scripts) as LGPL
[19:37:02] <frost-core> is it only for libraries?
[19:37:21] <frost-core> and, how can i replace it?

[19:40:11] <AwesomeAdam54321> frost-core: No it's not only for libraries, it's mainly for libre programs that are intended to be linkable by proprietary programs
[19:41:14] <frost-core> ok that was a huge mistake
[19:41:17] <AwesomeAdam54321> frost-core: Are you using a repository, if so you can easily undo those changes
[19:41:26] <frost-core> im using a notabug repository
[19:41:35] <frost-core> with a "LICENSE" File
[19:41:38] <frost-core> that i can edit
[19:41:52] <frost-core> can you send a raw link of GPL 3?
[19:42:11] <frost-core> What i mean with raw is like, text that i can copy

[19:54:22] <frost-core> ok then!
[19:56:01] <frost-core> only those lines? what about line ten?
