[00:15:03] <Taro42> Hello. I have a question about --verify-signatures: Do I really need to set the trust level of every public key to 5 / ultimate? I tried anything less than 5 and git complained about it being untrustworthy. This is weird because ultimate trust usually implies that I'm the owner, but there may be other keys that I trust, but I wouldn't want to set it to set that trust level regardless.
[00:15:09] <Taro42> e.g. git pull --verify-signatures
[00:15:50] <Taro42> henk: thanks for the reminder btw. I completely forgot about it.

[08:00:38] <mackerman> !dropbox_why
[08:00:38] <gitinfo> git uses a lot of frequently-changed small files, which dropbox's synchronization algorithms barf on. Use of multiple dropbox clients compounds this, with hilarious results
[08:01:32] <structoha> alright thx, i guess i will add the files and exclude the .git
[08:01:33] <mackerman> An archived repo in one file is a different matter.  man git bundle
[08:01:34] <gitinfo> the git-bundle manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-bundle.html
[08:02:37] <mackerman> Work tree file sync seems like a bad idea too.  The sync will introduce changes that are not in the history.
[08:04:51] <structoha> i will give git bundle a try, i dont see another solution for now
[08:04:53] <structoha> thank you
[08:05:23] <mackerman> Multiple file sync clients, one of which checks out a different work tree, that gets synced, then the other copy has changes, but for the wrong branch (!)
[08:06:38] <structoha> ya i guess i shouldnt mix the two solutions at all probably

[08:13:28] <mackerman> git bundle  generantes an archive file with history.  Good for any kind of file transfer you like, the usual network protocol not required.
[08:14:14] <mackerman> Backup software should be able to handle  a .git  directory with work tree.

[10:12:04] <onizu> hi
[10:12:34] <onizu> when I do 'git fetch' I am getting a new branch there, which I want to merge. But it's not yet available in 'git branch'
[10:12:41] <onizu> Do I need to 'git pull' for that?

[10:12:57] <onizu> Hope it will not merge with 'master'
[10:16:31] <onizu> I did 'git checkout remoteBranch'
[10:17:22] <onizu> then 'git checkout master' and then 'git merge --no-ff remoteBranch'. Is this  the right way? Or should there had been a 'git pull' somewhere in the process?

[10:28:46] <ikke> you could just do: git fetch, git merge origin/<branchname>
[10:28:53] <onizu> I see
[10:29:17] <ikke> but your approach is fine
[10:29:24] <onizu> so in that case I need to specify the origin
[10:30:13] <ikke> when you fetch branches from origin, git creates so called remote tracking branches
[10:30:20] <onizu> it would make sense to avoid checkout, as that remote branch was created by me on another computer, so I know what's there
[10:30:20] <ikke> they all have the remote name prefixed
[10:30:45] <onizu> I see
[10:32:36] <onizu> ikke: to be safe, I only pushed the new branch to remote and didn't merge with master on the other computer. But if I were sure of merging those changes, I get an option on GitHub to 'create pull request' from my new branch after I push, should I go for it?
[10:33:46] <ikke> if you just want to merge it, you could've already merged it locally

[16:49:33] <Taro42> I have a question about --verify-signatures: Do I really need to set the trust level of every public key to 5 / ultimate? I tried anything less than 5 and git complained about it being untrustworthy. This is weird because ultimate trust usually implies that I'm the owner, but there may be other keys that I trust, but I wouldn't want to set it to set that trust level regardless.

[19:10:57] <dms489> Should I give you the whole dialog?
[19:11:24] <ebeip90> Hello all! I love git diff's --function-context / -W feature, but there are certain file extensions where Git just decides to show the whole file.  I would like to disable the --function-context for specific extensions.  I know Git has some sort of support for this, as using --function-context to diff a .txt file behaves as if the flag was not specified.  How can I add more extensions to ignore / bypass this feature?

[19:15:28] <ebeip90> @nedbat: I have a ~/.gitattributes file, but there's no documented way to disable Git's attempt to interpret the contents of the file with -W/--function-context.  The file format in question just HAPPENS to look like C, e.g. has nested {{}}.  The file format starts with a C-style comment, and the first non-comment character is a '{', and the file ends with '}' -- so the "git diff --function-context" shows the whole file.  I tried setting "*.ext
[19:15:28] <ebeip90> diff=text" (and txt) but this didn't resolve the issue.
[19:17:36] <ebeip90> I also tried setting "git config --global diff.ext.command '!git diff -C5'" to try to force Git to use a different diff driver (to circumvent -W) but this didn't work either.

[20:01:58] <ebeip90> @nedbat: Managed to resolve it with a custom diff command.  It wasn't working originally because I was unaware that "git log" needs "--ext-diff" in order to use the diff.ext.command from ~/.gitconfig.
[20:05:00] <ebeip90> If anybody is curious, I also made it so that the diff output looks like the normal "git diff" output by moving the temporary files around and re-creating the directory path.  For the curious: https://gist.github.com/zachriggle/ed4eb9a6e5880eaf78dd7d29817e1313
