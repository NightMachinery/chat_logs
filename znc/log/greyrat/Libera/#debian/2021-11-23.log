Perhaps you're referring to an even older period, ext2 kernels unable to mount ext3 due to journal, and kernels unable to mount ext4 due to additional features. but kernels capable of ext4, which is what... 2.6.something onward... can mount any ext4

[01:00:48] <greycat> I suspect it's more complicated.  Also, mariadb doesn't do the coexistence thing.  When you release-upgrade, you get a new version of mariadb, period.

[04:39:25] <grolongo> hi, should I use .xinitrc or .xsessionrc on Debian? Both works but am I missing automatically sourcing stuff in /etc/X11/Xsession.d by using the former?
[04:39:36] <greycat> those two files are NOT equivalent
[04:40:00] <greycat> .xinitrc and .xsession are nearly equivalent, but .xsessionrc is very different

[04:42:50] <Khepra> technically xsession and xsessionrc are nearly equivalent. xsessionrc is debian's variant, both are exec'd upon graphical (DM) login. .xinitrc is just xserver init trigger
[04:43:05] <grolongo> greycat: I'm manually using startx to launch my wm, (I'm not using any Display Manager), I'm confused to which one should I use, from what I read, it was mentioned I could use either .xsession or .xsessionrc
[04:43:21] <Khepra> infact, xinitrc is only affected by xinit/startx, afaik, not by DM initiated xorg session
[04:43:50] <greycat> .xsessionrc is read by the Debian Xsession early on and does NOT replace the automatic selection of a session/WM.  .xsession DOES override the automatic selection of a session/WM.
[04:43:54] <Khepra> grolongo: actually you should use .xinitrc, if you're not using a DM
[04:44:25] <greycat> Khepra: actually, Debian uses .xsession from startx so that you don't need to maintain two separate files

[04:49:55] <greycat> If you use startx, you will activate the Debian Xsession(5).  The Debian Xsession reads .xsessionrc if it exists.  Then it looks for .xsession and if that exists, it runs that, OTHERWISE it looks for /usr/bin/x-session-manager or /usr/bin/x-window-manager or /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator and runs the first of those that it finds.
[04:50:36] *** Quits: dab21 (~dab21@pistis.amyanddavid.net) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[04:50:44] <greycat> If you use a display manager, you may activate the standard Debian Xsession(5) OR you might trigger a special GNOME session or whatever, depending on the DM and which things you click.  If you use the standard Debian Xsession then it works as shown above.
[04:51:46] *** Joins: dab21 (~dab21@pistis.amyanddavid.net)
[04:51:56] <greycat> So, you can see why .xsession and .xsessionrc are VERY different files.  One is optional and is always read if present, but otherwise does not alter the flow.  The other overrides things in the default flow.

[04:57:00] <grolongo> does Debian looks for .xsession even if it finds a .xsessionrc first?

[05:06:45] <grolongo> I'm not sure I get the difference. If there is one .xsessionrc, Debian founds it and mission is finished. If there is not, Debian searches for one .xsession: if there is, mission finished, otherwise it fallbacks to either /usr/bin/x-session-manager etc.
[05:12:47] <greycat> Your statement is incorrect.  The presence of .xsessionrc DOES NOT prevent Debian from looking for .xsession as well.
[05:13:29] <greycat> .xsessionrc is ALWAYS read if present, no matter what, even if you use the special GNOME session.
[05:13:43] <greycat> (I don't know about Wayland though)
[05:14:09] <greycat> .xsession if present is used INSTEAD OF the default flow that tries to find x-session-manager and so on
[05:14:21] <greycat> all of that occurs AFTER .xsessionrc has been read

[05:31:54] <greycat> Most people probably wouldn't or shouldn't have both files.  The only reason I can think of to have both would be if you're unsure of your environment.  Like, if you are switching among different display managers to test things out.  Or if your $HOME is shared among multiple systems.
[05:32:30] <greycat> Then you might put some common things in .xsessionrc just in case you find yourself launching a GNOME session.

[09:31:04] <n4dir> at0m: yes, i run sshd on the android, which to me isn't much fun, finding one which works ok. But then: i am really lousy with android or phones in general
[09:31:16] *** Joins: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc)
[09:32:31] <n4dir> in #linux i was told about more natural ways to share data between the phone and the laptop, but being that lousy i forgot all about i already. lol
[09:33:00] <msk`> i find it much easier and faster to run fdroid-ftp server on demand, transfer the stuff and shut it down when no longer required.
[09:33:03] <msk`> :)
[09:33:22] <n4dir> not sure where that would be faster

[09:37:25] <at0m> n4dir: kdeconnect is very convenient. but then that pulls in a lot of kde depends on android. more lightweight on the computer would be 'Device Connect'.
[09:38:22] <n4dir> at0m: thanks for that. I doubt i will ever fall in love with phones though. :-)
[09:38:23] <at0m> kdeconnect also lets the phone be a remote control for media players, keyboard and mouse, can show notifications on one from the other, and then some
[09:38:52] <n4dir> sounds great .
[09:40:13] <n4dir> just to make you laugh a bit: i mainly use the phone as a radio or as an mp3-player. lol
[09:42:17] <at0m> not laughing w you for that =) me, too, i have it stripped down. no google play, and yes often as remote control for MPD (musicpd.org)

[09:43:56] <n4dir> yeah, but for most, at least the younger ones, the phone seems to be the one-and-everything. Some consider me having no clue about computing, due to my age. While i know at least a bit, and more then them, about computers and stuff. It is just phones suck to me. Perhaps it is just the size. Also outside i want to be left alone, enough computing at home. :-)
[09:44:25] <n4dir> what you spoke of, remote control say for mpd, something like that sounds interesting. To me
[09:45:39] <at0m> next update won't be to LOS, but https://e.foundation/ which liberates the phone even more
[09:47:17] <n4dir> good. I wish such options were more widespread already.
[09:48:00] <n4dir> at0m: back a decade i was much in the freedombox project, trying to get my head in it. Heard lots of speeches by Eben Moglen, which sure are entertaining, not sure if valid
[09:48:17] <n4dir> he claimed: as soon you use a smartphone, give up the whole idea (of privacy) altogether
[09:48:19] <at0m> n4dir: totally valid :>

[09:49:10] <at0m> well, freedom on phones has come a long way. for those looking for it, ofc. most are running outdated android OEMs though, i guess
[09:49:52] <n4dir> i didn't think about phones, regarding such problems, anymore in a long time. No idea what is the state of art regarding a different OS and such.
[09:50:17] <n4dir> to me their main problem really is the size. I can't handle them well.
[09:50:39] <n4dir> i always get angry and all, so i avoit the phone as much as possible.

[09:53:41] <n4dir> i calmed down a bit, but for a while i really tried hard to avoid non-free software, say on debian installations, as far as possible. Also got my head in a few gnu.org approved (?) distros.
[09:53:58] <n4dir> To me such matters, not as much as in the past, but if i can, i will always pick such solutions
[09:54:23] <at0m> yea and it helps to consider before buying

[14:49:10] <Haohmaru> maybe the network thing?
[14:49:36] <Cool_Fire> I _think_ systemd-resolved.service

[14:55:40] <emilsp> It's not systemd-resolved that's doing this, since then /etc/resolv.conf wouldn't be modified. I am aware that /run|/var/run is recreated during boot.
[14:56:16] <alkisg> What does "it changed your /etc/resolv.conf" mean? It deleted the symlink and created a file in its place?
[14:56:40] <alkisg> Or do you mean that it changed the contents of the file (=symlink), which is what systemd-resolved does?
[14:58:03] <emilsp> it overwrites it's contents
[14:58:33] <emilsp> it replaced the usual preamble and multiple nameservers with a plain line of "nameserver $local_resolver_ip` which is wrong

[15:06:21] <ychaouche> which is fair
[15:07:25] <ychaouche> I haven't thought about it before but the problem isn't solved for compiling software yourself either, as makefiles can contain anything too, and at some point you run a make install as root.
[15:07:29] <Haohmaru> the apt/dpkg stuff in crapbuntu is modified, they have additional "features" in it that make this PPA horror "more user-friendly" afaik
[15:08:44] <Cool_Fire> makefiles can contain malicious commands too. It's usually just easier to spot than when it's in a script in a package

[15:16:26] <alkisg> But you do need to check who signs them
[15:18:22] <Khepra> alkisg: "While "random ones" can be compiled at some developer pc"  ..  that's very much false sense of security. "modified" (subverted, malware, underhanded, ...) code can very much be built by a PPA. There really is no difference between a random PPA and a random .deb download site, both have the same auditing policy: none
[15:19:08] <alkisg> Khepra: if I upload my code in my PPA and it gets compiled by the Ubuntu builders, who can inject malware?
[15:19:09] <Khepra> in fact, malware was very much inserted into canonical's pet: snaps. there's no auditing of the code. it's wild west.
[15:19:38] <Khepra> alkisg: the developer. the comparison here is PPA vs random download site. the developer is the threat actor, not the server that holds the debs
[15:20:08] <alkisg> Khepra: the difference is that I can't see the source of a random deb, but I can see the ones that get compiled in a ppa
[15:20:12] <alkisg> That's a huge difference
[15:20:16] <Khepra> it's not really

[15:20:45] <alkisg> How so? If I sign and upload the source, and it gets compiled in a third party PC, how can I hide something inside?
[15:20:50] <Khepra> the point is PPAs are NOT audited. security wise, they are NOT more secure than a random .deb download site
[15:20:53] <alkisg> That I couldn't hide when uploading it to debian?
[15:21:13] <alkisg> Not audited yes. But they're completely not the same as a random, closed source .deb
[15:21:37] <Khepra> you're conflating different things here: signging the code (malware can and has been signed), and MITM/chain-of-supply attack against the server holding the debs
[15:22:05] <alkisg> The same things are true for the debian archive as well
[15:22:12] <alkisg> The only difference is the "auditing" that you said, Nothing more
[15:22:16] <Khepra> is a random server more or less vulnerable than canonical's PPA infra? maybe, maybe not. PPA going to protect against malicious developers? nope.

[15:23:39] <Khepra> you've shifted the goal post to another planet now.   the convo was about PPAs vs third party server.
[15:24:01] <ychaouche> another planet :p
[15:24:08] <alkisg> I only made a single argument. That the source is available, and it's built by a third party server
[15:24:16] <alkisg> I don't know what you're talking about planets etc
[15:24:25] <Khepra> yes, and "third party server" is PPAs servers too.
[15:24:31] <alkisg> And it's a huge difference than debs from closed sources/builds
[15:24:50] <alkisg> Yes, which ensures safety, as they don't get compiled by the uploader
[15:24:57] <Khepra> I'm talking about your argument of closed vs open source, it's irrelevant for the comparison of PPA vs third party server, both being open source. there's no closed source in this convo.
[15:25:20] <Khepra> anyway, this is getting way off hand. my only point was don't delude yourself thinking PPAs are some magic sauce in security. they're not.
[15:25:31] <alkisg> A random deb from the internet has no guarantee that it was compiled in an official infrastructure
[15:25:43] <Khepra> "compiled on official infrastructure" is irrelevant
[15:25:45] <alkisg> While from OBS or PPAs, it does
[15:26:00] <Haohmaru> i still wouldn't want the PPA, i don't trust canonical
[15:26:09] <alkisg> Of course it's not. If I upload a viber.deb in my own server, and give  you its source, you have no way to know that the source maps to the compiled binary
[15:26:10] <Khepra> you're talking about one tiny vector (compromise of hardware) while ignoring a much bigger, more likely vector: malicious developer
[15:26:25] <ychaouche> alkisg: maybe you could explain why you think compiling on the PPA is safer than compiling on the developer's PC ?
[15:26:31] <alkisg> I'm talking only about malicious developer
[15:26:46] <Khepra> alkisg: again, that's irrelevant. you also have no way to verify that PPA upload doesn't contain malicious code.
[15:26:48] <ychaouche> alkisg: cause honestly I don't understand the different
[15:26:48] <alkisg> ychaouche: sure, I just said it, but let me rephase it once more
[15:26:57] <alkisg> Suppose that I want to send you malware with my appX
[15:27:16] <alkisg> So, I upload it to alkisg.com/appx.deb, and then I tell you to see the source in github.com/appx
[15:27:34] <alkisg> The trick there is that I injected malware in my code and I uploaded a bad appx.deb
[15:27:40] <alkisg> And you have no way of knowing it
[15:27:44] <Khepra> exactly the same argument is applicable to PPAs. PPA debs do not hold the chain of signature from SOURCE to final build.

[15:46:40] <Khepra> in fact, very similar attack vector happened very recently with github repo credentials stolen.  it's all the same class of attacks: chain of supply. therefore it makes no sense to differentiate indiviual computers (PPA servers or random developer's PC)

[15:46:46] <ychaouche> f8e4: the hardware design of the OnlyKey is surprising. Having users push buttons on a card that is directly plugged to the usb is asking for damage. Wouldn't be it better to put the device on the desktop and connect it via a usb cable ? but then again, even usb cables can't be trusted these days... hard compromise.

[15:47:33] <wodim> hello, sometimes the oom reaper kills some of my services (such as postgres). how can i tell systemd to restart them immediately? (currently, systemd leaves those processes dead forever)
[15:47:42] <ychaouche> that's a shame
[15:47:45] <Khepra> GH repos can be compromised, as we've seen plenty of times in the recent years. some are spotted immediately, some are not.
[15:47:49] <PerfDave> There's very little difference between a malicious developer and a trustworthy developer developing on a malicious PC :)
[15:48:25] <ychaouche> wodim: something like a respawn ?
[15:48:27] <Khepra> wodim: Restart=always in the service unit. HOWEVER, you should better remove the reason for OOM
[15:48:47] <Khepra> for starters you can adjust postgres oom score, but ideally.... get more RAM is the only, ultimate, proper solution.
[15:48:58] <Khepra> OR tune postgres memory requirements
[15:49:26] <Khepra> PerfDave: thank you taht's the point I'm trying to make here. it's all attack against chain of supply.
[15:49:34] <rk4> how much RAM does postgres have available?
[15:50:01] <wodim> Khepra: you are right that ideally I would have enough ram. alas... :-) thanks. i guess i should copy the service file from /usr/lib or wherever it is to /etc/systemd ?

[18:38:05] <inviz> Hi. I am installing Debian in UEFI mode, used guided partitioning. Installer created 536MB ESP (UEFI) partition, and the rest is crypto (479GB). I thought the whole partition will be UEFI, not only the bootable bit?
[18:38:26] <PerfDave> inviz: Why did you think that?
[18:38:34] <inviz> (there is /boot ext2 partition as well FYI)
[18:38:57] <inviz> PerfDave, I do not know, is UEFI only related to booting the system?
[18:39:09] <PerfDave> Pretty much, yeah
[18:39:42] <inviz> hmm ok that's great then, I was banging my head whole day. Thanks.
[18:41:31] <co0n> inviz, that's the expected outcome as you were already told, just confirming.
[18:42:03] <inviz> Thanks:)
[18:43:05] <inviz> I think i was confused by comments like UEFI can recognise larger partitions/disks.
[18:43:53] <PerfDave> UEFI can use a different partition table scheme to BIOS, but the UEFI partition is just the place where the it'll look for the GRUB executable.

[18:45:35] <PerfDave> Roughly speaking, BIOS uses MBR partition tables and UEFI uses GPT, but there are BIOS implementations which can also speak GPT and most UEFI implementations can read MBR
[18:46:27] <inviz> So, when I read something like "Supports operating system boot partitions greater than 2 terabytes (2 TB) in size" - is it for bootable UEFI partition only? the one that I cannot use for root / ?

[18:48:58] <alkisg> This is not related to BIOS/UEFI. The MBR partition table supports partitions up to 2 TB, while the GPT partition table supports more.
[18:49:02] <co0n> Using the old legacy MBR partitioning, partitions are limited to 2TB and you can only have 4.
[18:49:58] <PerfDave> And with GPT it's something like 8/64 ZiB :)

[20:53:08] <dcpc007> for home i switch to this interface, that is more common and not too heavy in resources

[20:53:48] <Haohmaru> for a resource-conservative DE i use LXDE
[20:54:07] <Haohmaru> i tried cinnamon but didn't like it
[20:54:19] <dcpc007> or maybe the netinst allow to install cinnamon by default too ?
[20:55:05] <Haohmaru> sure it does, during installation it asks you whether you want stuff like openssh webserver, blahblah, and desktop (and if so, what kinds)
[20:55:06] <dcpc007> yes, but as i try to make friends and family try linux, Cinnamon is the nearer of Windows, and stay simple in its config
[20:55:09] <Haohmaru> default is gnome
[20:55:41] <dcpc007> not too much configurations available, but enought to play with. and start menu very similar (to windows 7 at least)
[20:56:01] <Haohmaru> i come from windows (specifically i did like the win98 UI), so LXDE for me with some tweaking to make things look "sane"
[20:56:04] <dcpc007> yes but i had the choice in graphical install to take cinnamon only

[22:49:32] <hansol> what ?
[22:49:35] <hansol> dont understand you
[22:49:44] <hansol> i have two sites one with 8.0 one with 5.4

[22:50:07] <Khepra> yes
[22:50:08] <hansol> runned on my debian ?
[22:50:57] <greycat> Run the old site on an older installation.  Either a separate machine, or a VM, or a container.
[22:51:21] <hansol> so no way ?
[22:51:41] <Khepra> hansol: yes way. the same answer I gave you last time
[22:52:03] <greycat> You want a "way"?  Here is a way.  Fix the bloody stupid PHP application so that it runs under a more recent PHP.
[22:52:12] <hansol> xD
[22:52:16] <hansol> its opencart 1.5.2.1
[22:52:18] <hansol> no way

[22:52:46] <hansol> yes :)
[22:52:57] <Khepra> and you want our support to keep doing that nonsense?
[22:53:09] <hansol> no
[22:53:10] <hansol> TT
[22:53:16] <oerheks> PhpStorm is a help with compatibility check
[22:53:55] <oerheks> greycat +1 a vm could help
[22:54:18] <Khepra> hansol: since PHP 5.4 no longer exists you can do two things:  a) install a package from older debian, if that will even work,  or b) compile PHP yourself with a custom prefix so you don't break 8.0

[23:39:09] <Khepra> NOT as root:   apt remove -s <package>   and see what else falls out
[23:39:18] <greycat> That isn't explicitly tracked.  But if your setup isn't complex and isn't dynamic over time, "aptitude why exim4-daemon-light" might tell you.
[23:39:39] <Khepra> not the same as "what pulled this in" because stuff can be pulled in by recommends or suggests, but at least you'll quickly see what's critical reverse deps

[23:42:10] <peve> Does anyone here know a good remote desktop control software that is free (as in freedom)? I have many friends that live far away from me facing frequent issues with their systems and it would be much easier to just fire up some remote access software and do things myself instead of them sending me pictures of their screens and me telling which commands to run. Of course SSH or VNC servers would do the job, but they cannot always configure it or are
[23:42:10] <peve> using networks for which they don't have the required privileges to do so
[23:42:21] *** Thargoid is now known as stw
[23:43:26] <peve> Ideally, something that I could tell them to just apt install, enable the service, and share their remote address or some sort of ID with me

[23:45:08] <Khepra> you can tell them to apt install openssh-server and then you take off from that

[23:49:08] <alkisg> peve: there's reverse vnc, and there's tmate. In both of them they don't need to do port forwarding etc
[23:49:53] <alkisg> For reverse vnc, YOU run vncviewer -listen, and YOU forward port 5500, and THEY run x11vnc -connect your-ip
[23:50:21] <alkisg> In that easy mode, it's unencrypted, so take care when typing passwords etc

[23:54:22] <peve> Khepra: is there a way to allow ssh connections coming from an external network if they do not have any privileges over it?
[23:54:46] <peve> alkisg: that's really clever! I'll try it. Thanks!
[23:55:51] <Khepra> peve: the service sets up itself on port 22, unprivileged access password base, automatically. so unless there's firewall your friends have to fiddle with, or port forwarding, it's all good to go
[23:59:21] <Khepra> btw, ssh can do reverse tunneling as well.
