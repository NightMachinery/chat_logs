[13:44:50] <gour> mu4e also has some ability to add custom tags (https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Adding-a-new-kind-of-mark.html), but probably not close to notmuch's capabilities. i also like that refiling/removingg msgs is done outside of notmuch keeping one's mail silo safe

[14:41:39] <bremner> yeah, message-templ being dead is my fault, I should fix that.
[14:42:32] <bremner> it's in Debian, so Debian users can just install it.
[14:47:27] <gour> i'm still on fedora until my replacement disk for raid1 arrives, then i'll re-install and migrate to debian/sid
[14:49:16] <bremner> gour: fwiw, here's the new home of message-templ: https://git.tethera.net/message-templ.git/
[14:49:26] <bremner> now I just need to update the notmuch wiki
[14:50:30] <gour> in gnus setup i use posting-styles - that's not possible to re-use?
[14:50:45] <bremner> I don't know.

[16:23:18] <gour> am i right that message-templ cannot define as much elements as gnus-alias (Organization, Extra headers, signature...)?
[16:25:43] <gour> it would be nice to have something like mu4e's contexts (https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/What-are-contexts.html#What-are-contexts)...
[16:26:39] <bremner> I think message-templ can insert arbitrary headers
[16:27:19] <gour> bremner: that would be nice...can one define signature as well?
[16:27:29] * gour is using fortune-output
[16:27:45] <bremner> I imagine bottom-file would work for that
[16:28:38] <gour> ...like: (shell-command-to-string "fortune some-fortune-file")
[16:28:57] <gour> ok, will play with it...
[16:40:42] <gour> what about "X-Message-SMTP-Method"? that's also possible to configure per account?
[16:46:17] <bremner> I guess, just add it like any other header?
[16:46:32] <gour> for now i'm not using smtpmail, but msmtp due to its logging capabilities...maybe better to stay with it

[18:09:23] <gour> mu4e keeps special colon 'flags' - there is even package with unicode ones, but one probably does not need it in notmuch since flags are repalced by tags, right?
[18:12:53] <bremner> I don't know about mu4e flags; are they maybe related to maildir flags?
[18:14:28] <gour> probably, stuff like flags for msg having attachment, reply, marked etc. see e.g. https://github.com/stardiviner/mu4e-marker-icons/tree/e5c4f9b14eab69a0a28f108c6fee3390e19bd080
