[00:00:04] <tomsmeding> so GHC has to unify "Inner mode pat" and "Inner mode pat'", but it can't use this unification to deduce anything about pat' because Inner is non-injective
[00:01:00] <tomsmeding> (recall that a function f is injective if f x = f y => x = y)
[00:01:13] <dminuoso> Are these two not alpha equivalent?
[00:01:34] <tomsmeding> sure, you can _choose_ pat' ~ pat and make the constraints work out
[00:01:47] <tomsmeding> but you have no guarantee that that is the only valid choice for pat'
[00:02:00] <tomsmeding> because there may be other values for pat' for which Inner mode pat' ~ Inner mode pat
[00:02:35] <tomsmeding> in fact, I'm indirectly forcing this choice pat' ~ pat by forcing pat' to equal the type parameter of that Proxy, which I set to pat
[00:02:41] <dminuoso> So I guess one solution would be to newtype Sel intead.
[00:02:45] <tomsmeding> yes
[00:03:12] <tomsmeding> that fixes the problem too :p
[00:03:23] <dminuoso> It seems my naive expectation was constantly "Hey you tool, Im giving you `Sel ()`, and you allow `Sel a`. Work it out!"
[00:03:27] <tomsmeding> and is probably a nicer solution, depending on the rest of your code
[00:03:37] <tomsmeding> right, which works for injective type constructors
[00:03:40] <tomsmeding> but Sel is not
[00:03:44] <tomsmeding> and newtypes and data types are

[00:04:20] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: So it seems one other solution would be to fix mode
[00:04:31] <dminuoso> Because then GHC can resolve the type family, and then do regular plain old unification
[00:04:57] <tomsmeding> as in, make 'mode' a type parameter to Sel?

[00:11:19] <geekosaur> I just use `, it's only ambiguous if the content is a single identifier :)
[00:11:37] <tomsmeding> but I don't feel like adding a hotkey to my keyboard layout for guillemets :p
[00:11:42] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: So the two solutions we now have is: newtype on Sel, which means *every* use site has to wrap the selector before passing it around, or we use Tagged + tyfam fundeps, which just imposes a `runTagged` each time you use the `ArgF Descr` style
[00:11:48] <tomsmeding> geekosaur: true
[00:12:01] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Given that the `Field` mode is by far used more, the second approach seems less intrusive
[00:12:08] <dminuoso> otoh, with newtypes you get far easier diagnostics..
[00:12:17] *** exarkun_ is now known as exarkun
[00:12:31] <tomsmeding> are you using the selectors as actual selectors as well
[00:12:45] <dminuoso> Well, only to read fields.
[00:12:50] <tomsmeding> if not, do the lens thing and define the natural selector names as newtype-wrapped versions of the actual ones
[00:12:53] <tomsmeding> ah
[00:13:07] <dminuoso> Let me give you a broad idea what i Have:
[00:13:14] <dminuoso> To introduce you why I started this whole thing:
[00:13:52] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: https://gist.github.com/dminuoso/7df4f8ad87906050e08a0c1a0e041234
[00:14:24] <dminuoso> Now, I can simply fling a selector around, and the relevant code can first check the authorization, while at the same time logging the correct description using permsDescr
[00:14:36] <dminuoso> And at the same time, permsDescr is used in the config parser for diagnostics and help output
[00:14:44] <dminuoso>     permTSIGKeyDelete     <- optSection' "tsigKeyDelete" auth''spec (descr permTSIGKeyDelete)
[00:14:47] <dminuoso> Using lines like that
[00:14:54] <tomsmeding> auth''spec
[00:15:02] <tomsmeding> but yeah I figured this was for automatic documentation
[00:15:13] <tomsmeding> or, automatic description of the fields
[00:15:18] <dminuoso> Indeed.
[00:15:53] <tomsmeding> so where would the Tagged go exactly, again?
[00:16:26] <dminuoso> type family Inner tag field = r | r -> tag field where   Inner Field f = Maybe f;  Inner Descr f = Tagged f T.Text
[00:16:32] <dminuoso> Note, that by using Tagged we can make the tyfam injective
[00:16:41] <dsal> tomsmeding: Yeah, I think so, just -N.  It seems like an ideal parallel case, but only half my cores spin up.

[00:17:12] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: ah hold on, this gist is mispaste because emacs had a non-reverted buffer
[00:17:20] <tomsmeding> if a computation doesn't allocate, it doesn't yield to the scheduler, and stuff gets locked up and no more threads get spawned
[00:17:51] <tomsmeding> I fought with this a while ago, though I had N-1 threads instead of N/2
[00:17:57] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Its updated.
[00:18:08] <tomsmeding> so the "solution" (read: workaround) was -N$(($(njobs) + 1))

[00:20:48] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: This comes at the cost of every time I want to pull the documentation, I have to `runTagged`. But honestly, with newtype *everytime* you wanted to use a selector you'd have to unSel it, and everytime you wanted to pass it you'd have to Sel it.
[00:20:56] <dminuoso> So ergonomically that seems far worse
[00:21:01] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: makes sense
[00:21:08] <merijn> tomsmeding: No, but then you don't have to remember to set flags and compiles with those flags enabled :p
[00:21:29] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: ah, and it also kind of makes sense: the documentation is just a string, but it's tagged with the type of the thing that it's documenting

[00:32:13] <dsal> With `+RTS -N -e200000` it uses all the cores.

[00:32:58] <dsal> With -qg it only uses ~1 core.
[00:33:05] <merijn> For GC...
[00:33:18] <merijn> It doesn't affect the number of capabilities
[00:33:25] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Another solution in this design space would be to attach this documentation string to each field via Tagged and symbols.

[00:33:43] <merijn> "+RTS -N" without -qg is almost always a mistake
[00:33:47] <dminuoso> But then I have to Tagged/runTagged fields all over the place. :(
[00:34:00] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: interesting tradeoff
[00:34:38] <dminuoso> i.e. so you'd have `data Foo = Foo { field1 :: Tagged "its a field" Char, field2 :: Tagged "another field" Int }`
[00:34:54] <dminuoso> This incurs far less extensions and is mostly unnoticeable
[00:35:14] <dminuoso> But if you have any unification errors with those fields, the diagnostics will be a bit noisy
[00:35:19] <dsal> merijn: this is with -qg https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CMwJgYfY/sstdout.txt
[00:35:33] <dminuoso> Well. Unnoticeable apart from having to runTagged/Tagged everywhere
[00:35:34] <merijn> 36% productivity oof
[00:35:44] <dminuoso> But if you use `lenses`, you could hide this away

[00:36:24] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Mmm. Actually this might be tempting

[00:37:49] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Honestly, the more I have worked with this, the more I realize this is black magic to anyone not involved in type families
[00:37:58] <dsal> decodeLine figures out what map works and then applies it to the "output" section.  So it's definitely doing some work.
[00:38:04] <dminuoso> Nothing about it is clear to unsuspecting users.
[00:38:11] <dsal> without the -qg (and another 0 of -e) :    Productivity  76.4% of total user, 9.4% of total elapsed
[00:38:31] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: then perhaps the Tagged-with-docs-in-Symbol version is actually more accessible, even if more noisy
[00:38:35] <dsal> It doesn't actually get *faster*, but it does more.
[00:38:41] <merijn> dsal: Basically that means you have a giant live set, which I guess isn't surprising with the parMap + rseq
[00:38:58] <dminuoso> It's sort of annoying we have no way of annotating data types
[00:38:58] <tomsmeding> dsal: I can relate
[00:39:14] <dsal> Let me try -N8.  I have this asymmetrical multiprocessor thing going on.
[00:39:27] <dsal> I like that it's working harder.  I'd just hope that'd make it go faster.
[00:39:38] <merijn> But that's also a *giant* time for the problem
[00:39:49] <dsal> Oh, it says it decided on -N10
[00:39:51] <merijn> Isn't the problem simply that decodeLine is super slow
[00:40:28] <dsal> Sure, if decodeLine is slow, then I'd think using twice as many cores to get the same amount of work done wouldn't take almost the same amount of time.
[00:40:32] <merijn> 132s, mine is effectively instant doing every line sequentially

[00:42:28] <merijn> dsal: eh, wait
[00:42:43] <merijn> dsal: Shouldn't it be "parMap rpar" not "parMap rseq"?

[00:43:26] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: I agree

[00:44:38] <merijn> tbh, I'm not sure, I haven't used parallel much

[01:00:06] <merijn> dsal: oh, improper caching with criterion can also mess you up, depending on how you're configuring the criterion benchmarks
[01:01:29] <sprout_> ah.  that too.  200 threads competing on access to the same data structures?

[01:09:05] <dminuoso> I think I made my decision
[01:09:54] <Guest97> Question - I need the type-level version of the identity function, that is a type `Ident` of kind `* -> *` where `a = Ident a`.
[01:09:54] <Guest97> I know its possible to construct this using type synonyms in Scala, but when I tried `type Ident a = a`, I can't seem to use `Ident` as a higher-kinded type. Is there any way to do this?

[05:04:28] <oats> finally got day 8 https://github.com/oatberry/aoc2021-haskell/blob/main/src/Day8.hs
[05:04:50] <oats> I bet there's a better way to have done this, but I figured out an algo for deducing segment assignments
[05:05:41] <dsal> I found it was *significantly* faster to use `[(Char, Char)]` instead of `Map Char Char`
[05:06:11] <oats> dsal, what does your `Map Char Char` represent
[05:06:55] <dsal> The observed wire to the wire where it's supposed to be according to the diagram.
[05:07:11] <oats> huh
[05:07:13] <georgy> dsal, how many elements do you have?
[05:07:14] <dsal> Oh, you had a `Segment`
[05:07:19] <dsal> georgy: 7
[05:07:29] <georgy> that's not surprising
[05:08:11] <oats> I had a hunch that some set operations might be useful, but it took some guesswork to tease out exactly what I had to do
[05:08:12] <georgy> I did tests a couple of years ago, and IIRC Map starts becoming faster when you have a couple of hundred elements. and it only gets worse from there. O(n) vs log(n)
[05:09:02] <georgy> basically.. list is only faster when the speed likely doesn't matter at all
[05:09:41] <dsal> Speed's mattering a lot to me.
[05:10:08] <monochrom> "Each dictionary has size 5 but I have 10^10 such dictionaries" may favour a low-tech way.
[05:10:12] <georgy> when looking up an element in a 7 element collection?
[05:12:21] <monochrom> Or "I have to perform 10^10 lookups"
[05:12:29] <oats> dsal, ah yeah, my solution solves the big boy in about 10 seconds :P
[05:12:33] <georgy> monochrom, that sounds as contrived as your first example
[05:13:21] <dsal> oats: I'm trying to get below a second on my macbook, but it's a pretty bad place to benchmark I've found. heh
[05:14:01] <dsal> Currently at 1.103 s
[05:14:21] <monochrom> Well, all of AoC is contrived. There.
[05:15:54] <dsal> These are real problems.  If we don't get this done, Santa's not going to deliver presents. 
[05:16:20] <oats> I should try to find a way to figure the numbers straight from the scrambled input, without trying to calculate mappings
[05:16:24] <oats> wonder if that's possible...
[05:17:19] <dsal> I wouldn't think so...  the mappings tell you which things are on.

[09:32:28] <dsal> hololeap: part of it is just having a toolkit with all the things.
[09:33:11] <hololeap> it just seems... rediculous. I didn't even open it up until 10 minutes in so I had failed the leaderboards already
[09:34:20] <hololeap> I guess I won't be getting competitive with AoC
[09:34:31] <int-e> There are thousands of participants, and only 600 seconds in 10 minutes.
[09:36:34] <hololeap> so if you can't complete part 1 and part 2 by 10:00 you have lost... it's just a bit shocking that people can code that quickly
[09:36:44] <int-e> You're looking at something like the lower tail of a normal distribution (just for intuition, the actual distribution is bound to be something way more complicated)
[09:37:52] <dsal> hololeap: The trick is to get a private leaderboard without professional competitive programmers.  :)
[09:38:11] <xerox> works wonders for your self esteem
[09:40:23] <fizbin> Is anyone using stack to manage their advent-of-code stuff? I can't figure out how to have stack include an external module.
[09:40:52] <hololeap> I wonder if there's a twitch stream or something for some of the people on the leaderboard. I would be interested in seeing how someone writes something that quickly.

[09:42:02] *** Joins: jchia[m] (~jchiamatr@2001:470:69fc:105::c50b)
[09:42:41] <fizbin> I've got a flat directory layout (i.e. just a dir. with files like "aoc1.hs", "aoc2.hs", etc. in it) and a stack.yaml file generated by "stack init". I've mentioned the dependency in a package.yaml file, but stack says "Could not find module" when I do "stack ghc aoc9.hs"
[09:44:55] <dsal> That's kind of a weird way to use stack.
[09:45:27] <dsal> 'stack new' usually creates a project with a src directory and main and stuff.
[09:46:30] <fizbin> Right, which makes haskell the weird odd language where you can't just write the source but need its own directory structure. (I mainly solve these in python, then write the haskell solutions later)
[09:47:15] <int-e> runhaskell foo.hs < input
[09:47:25] <int-e> don't involve stack or cabal, be happy :-P
[09:47:43] <fizbin> int-e: That's what I'm trying to do, but now do that with an external package.
[09:48:20] <int-e> well, I have not run into that (but cabal v1-install still works for me if that comes up)
[09:48:44] <fizbin> Huh. It looks like package.yaml isn't getting read at all. I wonder if I need something in stack.yaml to tell it to use package.yaml

[09:50:51] <fizbin> Well, adding "." to packages in stack.yaml caused it to notice the parse error I added to package.yaml. Still doesn't seem to make it load the dependencies though.
[09:58:08] <fizbin> Okay, adding more than just "dependencies" to the package.yaml file (i.e. adding an "executable" section) seems to be enough so that now "stack runghc aoc9.hs" will load the external library dep. I asked for.
[09:59:58] <byorgey> hololeap: some of them might record themselves and post it later I guess, but you're not supposed to stream yourself solving AoC problems right when they are posted
[10:00:15] <byorgey> hololeap: but you can definitely find top competitive programmers streaming.

[10:20:56] <sm> fizbin, why not use a stack script, fewer moving parts
[10:21:00] <dsal> I pretty much have the same parseFile thing and some basic 2D stuff like around and a bfs.

[10:23:42] <xerox> bfs was easy to implement a month ago and put into my library too :D
[10:23:55] <dsal> Which was basically how to read this.  I always got my x and y confused when I'd write those from scratch.
[10:24:10] <dsal> Another neat thing I wrote in my library was BitSet.  Which I use occasionally.
[10:24:35] <dsal> It doesn't actually *matter*, but it's neat.  For yesterday's, I was able to shove each of the light 7 seg patterns into a byte.

[17:41:22] <dminuoso> Btw, if you have both a cabal.project and cabal.project.local, and both specify `packages: .`, then `cabal build` will find the package in your current directory twice and complain

[17:41:38] <boxscape> Yes, but then I have this nagging thought at the back of my mind that I'll eventually accidentally refactor the code to something that makes the `head` call unsafe, and I'm not protected by the type system

[18:09:34] <merijn> I could probably optimise it a bit by moving frequent code into a separate library modules and reusing that. But I kinda like each day being standalone. Makes them function better as examples for others

[18:13:15] <fizbin> Combined across my solutions to the first 9 problems, I have 9 distinct 'import' lines: Control.Monad, Data.Char, Data.List, Data.Maybe, Debug.Trace, Numeric, System.Environment, qualified Data.Map as M, and qualified Data.MultiSet as MS.

[18:14:57] <merijn> fizbin: Control.Monad, Data.Char, Data.Coerce, Data.Foldable, Data.Function, Data.Funtor.Identity, Data.List, Data.List.NonEmpty, 2x Data.Map (qualified and type), Data.Maybe, Data.Monoid, Data.Ord, Data.Semigroup, Data.Text, Data.Text.IO, Data.Void, System.Environment, System.Exist, System.IO and 3 Megaparsec ones :p
[18:15:23] <fizbin> Already this year, or is that your template?
[18:15:30] <merijn> That's just day9 :p
[18:15:57] <byorgey> my template for solving problems on open.kattis.com has ... 46 lines of imports =)
[18:16:35] <fizbin> As an aside, I've found this year's input parsing to be much simpler than in earlier years. By this point in 2020, we'd already needed to parse input like "light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags."
[18:16:52] <fizbin> So far this year, I've done all the parsing with "lines" and "words".
[18:16:55] <byorgey> fizbin: agreed.
[18:17:46] <merijn> fizbin: You can do it with lines/words if you assume only valid input, which violates my attempt to handle all errors explicitly approach :p

[18:25:01] <fizbin> I'm not sure how people get by without having their "main" get the name of the input file with getArgs, though I guess people could be writing stuff to always read the input from stdin. (Personally, I write my solutions - python and haskell - to take an optional first argument that's the input file with the default being "aocNN.in")

[18:27:58] <merijn> byorgey: Biggest flaw in my map rendering is that I should probably extend it to automatically detect cell size and account for that, so I can use multi character values instead of the current Char labelling which...does not quite work out for the big problems

[22:22:02] <awpr> first one is saying the instance expects `Traversable f` in order for `t f` to be `Functor`, but trying to convert it to the second one would mean trying to solve `Functor (t f)` given only `Functor f`, which isn't  enough to satisfy that instance's context

[22:49:45] <WilliamJ> I have managed to program an initial function to get the initial rectangle but stuck on how to do the other 2, the code is here https://paste.tomsmeding.com/OJQyGfBT any help would be appreciated :)
[22:50:30] <monochrom> What does "number of step" mean?
[22:50:49] *** Quits: curiousgay (~curiousga@77-120-141-90.kha.volia.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:50:54] <EvanR> is that ascii art accurate
[22:51:07] <WilliamJ> there is 3 rectangles outputted
[22:51:16] <WilliamJ> steps is the number
[22:51:41] <monochrom> That doesn't explain anything.
[22:51:49] <monochrom> Why are there 3 rectangles?
[22:51:57] <monochrom> Why are some of them bigger?
[22:52:05] <monochrom> Why are some of them indented?
[22:52:53] <monochrom> I only know that a rectangle has width and height. What is "step" doing with a rectangle?
[22:53:11] <aplainzetakind> It's obvious. The first parameter is the height, the second is the number of rectangles, and the third is the increase both in indentation and width as well as the initial width. What's the problem?
[22:53:24] <EvanR> so it is accurate
[22:53:44] <WilliamJ> Oh sorry, ok so, each step there will be another rectangle created. On each step the width will be the width of the last one + the width inputted by the user step is basically how many rectangles there will be, the indentation therefore is the width of the last rectangle sorry for not explaining
[22:53:52] <WilliamJ> currently my code only outputs the first rectangle
[22:53:58] <monochrom> No, it is non-obvious. What not three kinds of steps, one for indentation, one for increase in width, one for increase in height
[22:54:15] <EvanR> given the picture is accurate, it's a simple IQ test to figure the rest out
[22:54:23] <monochrom> And for that matter, why linear growth for any of them, why not logarithmic growth or quadratic growth
[22:54:33] <aplainzetakind> monochrom: I was being sarcastic.
[22:54:44] <WilliamJ> What I am confused about is how do I make it repeat it with the whitespace and make the width get bigger by that increment each time?
[22:54:46] <monochrom> OK sorry, thanks.
[22:54:48] <aplainzetakind> WilliamJ: The indentation is not the width of the previous rectangle though.
[22:55:08] <WilliamJ> Do I mean length? Habe I gotten them mixed up
[22:55:18] <EvanR> width, height
[22:55:19] <WilliamJ> The 2nd rectangle is meant to be indented by 3 whitespace
[22:55:35] <aplainzetakind> And the third?
[22:55:37] <WilliamJ> 6
[22:55:38] <EvanR> length is for rods and line segments
[22:55:43] <aplainzetakind> But why?
[22:55:47] <aplainzetakind> What does it all mean?
[22:56:35] <WilliamJ> What does what mean, the output or the indentation? It's meant to be an ascii art creator with asterixes, as EvanR mentioned before
[22:56:48] <WilliamJ> the Indentation is part of it
[22:56:59] <WilliamJ> sorry if this is unclear
[22:57:07] <int-e> aplainzetakind: try ##philosophy ;-)
[22:57:48] <aplainzetakind> In any case, I think you should first write a function f i w h, which outputs a single rectangle of the given indentation width and height, and use that to output multiple such rectangles.

[22:59:30] <monochrom> https://esmemes.com/t/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-good-person
[22:59:41] <WilliamJ> But on the task, it does not ask specifically for the indentation to be given as an input, it is worked out through the width of the last one
[23:00:24] <WilliamJ> hence on the example I gave, it went 3 whitespace, 6 whitespace.
[23:00:31] <EvanR> ah yes, the ancient philosopher esmemes
[23:01:26] <aplainzetakind> WilliamJ: I understand, you can use the proposed f above with values of i computed in the main task-fulfilling function.
[23:03:07] <monochrom> Write a helper function that makes one rectangle of height, width, indentation controlled by parameters.
[23:03:35] <monochrom> Now you just have to call that function multiple times, each time with larger numbers.
[23:03:36] <monochrom> "just"
[23:03:56] <WilliamJ> ok I got it working for the first place of the function, not sure why it isnt working on the other lines.
[23:04:00] <WilliamJ> What is a helper function?
[23:04:19] <monochrom> A function that the assignment doesn't directly say you have to write.
[23:04:33] <monochrom> But the assignment would be trivial if you wrote it first.
[23:04:49] <monochrom> This is why the assignment keeps it a secret.

[23:15:25] <WilliamJ> Is it saying [[Char]] because I am trying to do 2 outputs of different characters? whitespace and asterix
[23:15:55] <aplainzetakind> It's sayin something clearer.
[23:16:09] <aplainzetakind> Lines 3 and 4
[23:16:25] <WilliamJ> Oh ok, I see
[23:17:04] <WilliamJ> So because these are all grouped together due to the type of replicate being that it is not possible?
[23:17:52] *** Joins: dschrempf (~dominik@070-207.dynamic.dsl.fonira.net)
[23:19:18] <aplainzetakind> "grouped together" sounds a bit off.
[23:19:51] <monochrom> replicate wants 2 arguments. Why are you giving it 3?
[23:20:19] <aplainzetakind> If something like `f a b c` is supposed to be a valid expression, then f should take at least three arguments.
[23:20:39] <WilliamJ> I tried to give it 3 arguments as I thought in order to get the indentation on each line, they had to be together inside the same brackets but it seems that cannot be the case
[23:21:00] <aplainzetakind> Whitespace is function application.

[23:24:25] <WilliamJ> I added ++ between unlines(replicate i ' '++(replicate m(replicate n '*')))

[23:29:42] <int-e> monochrom: tbf there's some ambiguity in what that list was
[23:29:43] <monochrom> Perhaps quotes turn into whitespace?

[23:30:11] <monochrom> Consider the zip"abc""def" example.

[23:33:51] <zero> why?
[23:33:55] <aplainzetakind> WilliamJ: To be more precise, (++) concatenates two lists of the same type, but here the first one encountered is a list of Char's.
[23:33:56] <WilliamJ> Yes I understand that ++ concatenates 2 strings but why would it not work? as they are both technically strings?
[23:34:02] <int-e> they can be scary, they can become very big, but they do follow regular patterns that you can learn to identify relevant information
[23:34:12] <monochrom> What do lazy Sets do?  Why do strict Sets do?

[23:36:00] <aplainzetakind> attempting*
[23:36:16] <WilliamJ> Okay, I am seeing where it is coming from now
[23:36:20] <monochrom> Data.Set is strict in BST skeleton, lazy in value.
[23:36:28] <boxscape> hackage says "A Set is strict in its elements."
[23:36:33] <monochrom> err, wait, no, not entirely lazy in value.

[23:36:57] <aplainzetakind> WilliamJ: You want to prepend i spaces to each chunk of '*', where are they?.
[23:37:08] <monochrom> It is somewhat strict in values to the point of resolving x<=y questions.
[23:37:18] <geekosaur> and it makes no sense to have a lazy Set because (a) no values to be lazy (b) spine has to be strict due to ordering and balancing
[23:37:18] *** Joins: juhp (~juhp@128.106.188.82)
