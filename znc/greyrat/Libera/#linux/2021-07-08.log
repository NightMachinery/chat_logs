Something you *have*, like a physical key or cryptographic nonce that cannot be duplicated, and 3. Something you *are*, like a biometric handprint, fingerprint, sphincterprint, or iris scan
[00:13:43] <Dagmar> "Two-factor" authentication means having more than one of those two _categories_

[03:36:22] <phoenixes> not ubuntu
[03:36:40] <johnnyapol> I think the no proprietary drivers in use thing in software & updates refers to closed source kernel modules; however, it can still be loading proprietary blobs / firmware for things.
[03:37:22] <ramzy> phoenixes: whats a lubuntu?
[03:37:33] <johnnyapol> lubuntu = ubuntu with lxde desktop environment
[03:37:33] <phoenixes> lubuntu is a derivative of ubuntu

[06:56:14] <Wafficus> yep tried on those channels, no response. Anyone decent with Samba? Just wanted to ask before trying later this week
[06:56:39] <Wafficus> Only thing I could find was to disable Selinux on Fedora Server which might have been blocking it
[06:57:06] <Dagmar> I use Samba "recreationally"
[06:57:21] <Dagmar> Disabling Selinux is an easy enough test, as is checking /var/log/audit.log at the time of hte event
[06:57:57] <Dagmar> There are _definitely_ some selinux booleans relating to Samba you probably should look at.  `getsebool -a | grep samba` and if anything looks directly related, flip it and see

[06:59:56] <Dagmar> Okay, setting it as disabled there _won't_ disable it unless you reboot because at boot time is the only time that's read.
[07:00:09] <Dagmar> If you want to disable it like, right away, use `setenforce 0`
[07:00:22] <Dagmar> Then restart Samba and take a crack at it.  If that doesn't work, pastebin your Samba config somewhere
[07:00:38] <Dagmar> The "tree connect" thing I can't even guess what it's trying to do
[07:01:04] <Dagmar> If it's exposing a more or less basic fileshare, those are pretty straightforward
[07:01:33] <Dagmar> Note: Don't _leave_ it disabled if Selinux isn't being a problem.  You're almost always better with that on
[07:02:03] <Dagmar> For the vast majority of things, there's just a boolean to tweak, and occasionally a label to change with semanage/restorecon

[07:03:06] <Dagmar> Uhh... doing some quick Googling, my guess is that you're trying to share a non-standard location with Samba

[07:03:31] <Wafficus> I see
[07:03:31] <Dagmar> THat's a thing you can usually just fix with semanage/restorecon, but let's not get crazy and expose /etc or something like that
[07:03:48] <Wafficus> that doesn't seem too bad of a fix

[15:47:39] <locsmif> Hi all. I am running csync2 + lsyncd on two VMs, each VM on a different machine. When I unpack or cp -a some large directory tree to a monitored folder on VM A, it starts syncing to VM B as expected. However, when lsyncd runs on both VM A *and* VM B, it appears the back-and-forth slows everythnig down enormously
[15:48:06] *** Joins: xrogaan (~xrogaan@user/xrogaan)
[15:49:31] <locsmif> If I stop lsyncd on VM B and then unpack or cp -a the directory tree which then starts the sync process, it's blazingly fast. So, some kind of catch 22-like behaviour must be the cause where a file being written to VM B triggers an inotify event, which triggers a sync attempt to VM A, which triggers another inotify and anotehr attempt to sync to VM B. Is there anyway I could tune or resolve this?
[15:49:49] <locsmif> any way*

[22:23:30] <PaulFertser> And then fall back to xterm
[22:23:52] <ayecee> barteks2x: okay well that's the fix. if it doesn't work, that probably needs the service file to figure out.
