[19:37:45] <Snuupy> can likely cross compile the arm images on an x86 machine
[19:38:30] <Snuupy> oh it's an issue with deps
[19:38:31] <Snuupy> hmm
[19:38:59] <Snuupy> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker/pull/119#issuecomment-859364557 sounds like updating from node:lts-alpine to a more recent version might fix it
[19:41:09] <bl1nk> The only option there would be to build our own nodejs image based on alpine-edge which might be unstable or wait until alpine 3.14 is released and do the same. I can see that depending on unstable repositories is not ideal.
[19:41:40] <Snuupy> ah.
[19:42:29] <Snuupy> maybe tag the arm releases as alpha and "unsupported but here you go for now" until they become stable enough?

[20:37:16] <bl1nk> Meh, I replaced sharp with ImageMagick, but the version shipped with the Debian version node:lts is based on does not support HEIC and errors. I could exclude that though.

[20:52:53] <bl1nk> What I wanted to express with that is that excluding image/heif from exif stripping in thelounge will probably not be a problem because files uploaded to thelounge will be converted to jpeg and stripping of exif data for jpeg works.
[21:13:59] <xnaas> Some Android phones default to HEIC now as well.

[21:37:09] <Snuupy> interesting, everyone supports webp now
[21:39:31] <bl1nk> I have not tried to explicitly install libheif yet, maybe that will already be enough to support HEIF
