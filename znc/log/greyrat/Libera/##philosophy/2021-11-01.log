[18:36:51] <Varde> Understanding is what you are given, and knowledge is what you have to give. If you don't know what a Kiwi is, but you hold it, you are understanding in so much as feeling and sense of the Kiwi. Knowledge on the other hand is what atomic signature(objects are of atomic nature), whether concise or not, you have written in mind concerning Kiwi's. When asked 'What is a Kiwi?' you refer to this signature.

[19:39:45] <Varde> Important to have a wordpress.
[19:42:20] <thunder> that equation (originated by alex wissner-gross) says that intelligence is a force (F) with strength (T) which maximizes future freedom of action given the diversity of possible accessible futures (S) up to a time horizon (τ).
[19:42:54] <Varde> F = T is good but the rest is pretty silly.
[19:43:10] <thunder> he created a proof in the form of a software algorithm which displays a basic form of general intelligence

[19:43:56] <Varde> Show me where strength was displayed.
[19:46:11] <thunder> here's another idea that touches on similar themes to your OP. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt
[19:46:11] <ro-bot-o> [url] Umwelt - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[19:47:41] <Varde> Yes actually
[19:51:14] <thunder> Varde: when I reach out and pick up a glass, the strength of the force that I use to grip it firmly, or too loosely, or to crush it, indicates my intelligence.
[19:52:35] <Varde> But you could be in a room just randomly picking up glasses and throwing them at people, in this case it's not an indicator of intelligence.
[19:52:54] <thunder> that's only an analogy though, but I think in that guy's equation he does actually mean a physical force, because he's modelling his concept of intelligence after observed physical behaviours
[19:53:43] <Varde> Intelligence is a force with strength which maximises action.
[19:53:53] <thunder> maximizes future freedom of action

[19:54:18] <Varde> I can pick up glass but it wouldn't be very maximal lest there was strength behind it.
[19:55:02] <thunder> using a light touch on the glass, means you can reuse it as a glass on future occasions, thus maximizing future freedom of action (ie. why people tend not to smash glasses on purpose).
[19:55:36] <Varde> Think about conciseness and intellectual. You must be concise before you can be intellectual about a subject matter. Picking up a glass is not a force of intelligence.
[19:55:59] <Varde> It's a force of matter.
[19:56:35] <Varde> Picking up a glass to fulfil thirst, now contains a force of intelligence.
[19:56:58] <Varde> You seem to conflate all force with intelligence/force.
[19:57:27] <thunder> I should probably not try to wade into the guy's formula since I don't understand it sufficiently to give you anything more than the chauffeur knowledge.

[20:07:27] <thunder> it might not seem like much to most people, but I spend a fair amount of time contemplating the difference between need and desire. it seems to me that need is primarily founded on bodily sustenance/survival, whereas desire exists within the psyche in a context of space/time which is not here/now (this instant).

[20:29:37] <thunder> in my situation with word play, I've identified groups of mutually contextual elements of consciousness. in order to provide them a label as a group, I've chosen particular words that weren't previously associated with that bundle of meaning. in the overall context of my system of thought, it makes sense. but if I want to communicate with someone, I have to spell things out more clearly before using the terms

[20:50:40] <apotheon> I'm confused about why one would initiate a conversation about something if one has no interest in discussing it with others.
[20:52:18] <pussipupu> They've been doing the same in another channel too, possibly trolling, possibly just ego and expecting everyone to bathe in the glory of their wisdom
[20:53:46] <apotheon> I haven't read enough backscroll to know anything definitive about foregoing disputes.  I just find that attitude about communication strange.
[20:54:21] * arryana sets the kitchen timer
[20:55:04] <apotheon> What does that mean, in context?
[21:02:01] <thunder> I worked on my own system of knowledge for many years and in spite of being full of meaning and highly useful to me in practice, it's incredibly hard for me to communicate it to other people because it's such a different way of looking at things than it seems most people are used to. that's frustrating at times, because one of the most basic human urges is to see your self reflected in another's eyes (metaphorically)
[21:03:44] <apotheon> thunder: seems interesting
[21:03:57] <apotheon> What do you mean by "system of knowledge"?
[21:04:05] <thunder> I think when people go online to talk, that's a big element of it. when people don't feel well received nor see their reflection, they tend to feel isolated and worthless. it can arouse a lot of painful feelings
[21:04:49] <apotheon> Writing an explanatory essay and seeking input on how to improve and clarify it might help.
[21:05:05] <thunder> apotheon: I set out to examine my consciousness from a first-person-perspective. the system is what has built up from all the related observations and the ways in which each identified element interacts with the others.
[21:05:11] <apotheon> One must simply ignore those who offer nothing useful, I guess.
[21:05:37] * arryana sings salmon chanted evening
[21:05:41] <apotheon> thunder: Have you tried writing out an explanation somewhere?
[21:07:03] <thunder> I am a crappy writer. but I talk about it with people often to try out different ways of presenting the core concepts. but each person is different too. it's not always about my method, but also about a receptive audience willing to contemplate the ideas rather than knee-jerk judge based on preconceptions
[21:07:05] <apotheon> I guess my earlier question, "What does that mean, in context?", is properly answered "Nothing."  I'm getting the impression to the kitchen timer was just a reference to off-screen activity, and was out-of-context.
[21:07:25] <apotheon> thunder: That's fair.
[21:08:06] <thunder> I have a whole tonne of written material, but it's overlapping in a lot of places, missing stuff in others, and written in entirely different styles
[21:08:15] <apotheon> I guess I'm lucky -- people seem to think I'm a good writer, except when they impose different goals on the writing than I had in mind.
[21:08:38] <thunder> not even sure of the genre it should be in yet tbh, because it's so abstract it could mold to many
[21:09:01] <apotheon> Genre?  Are you talking about fiction?
[21:10:25] <thunder> well, it could be written as allegory. it could be spelled out in a technical manner. it could be poetry or prose, myth or pure reference. it could be presented as a ritual sequence. a children's book. in some cases as grafitti. it depends on the audience I wish to communicate with
[21:11:49] <apotheon> okay
[21:11:54] <thunder> I actually have some ideas for a graffiti project or some kind of visual art. but I have to improve my skills with the medium
[21:12:05] <apotheon> Being aware of one's audience is good.
[21:12:58] <apotheon> Are you interested in sharing your insights about your system of knowledge with me?
[21:14:30] <thunder> sure. there're two main components or features. the first is structural, which defines the elements of consciousness as I perceive them. the second is more contemplative and involves juxtiposing various opposite or related terms, often in light of their structural place/context.
[21:16:09] <thunder> the structure begins with conscious activity in the most abstract and general sense. that is to say "difference, comparison, similarity, choice" are each mutually prerequisite for each other to exist, and create the ability to sense "kind" (ie. type, category, group, etc).
[21:19:07] <thunder> I refer to this group of 4 terms as "kindness" (for subsequent reasons the desirable response towards pain/pleasure experience). the kinds of senses are most broadly: space, time, body, psyche, other, self. kindness is applied to each of those sense categories to derive the variations within each (eg. touch, temperature, pressure, texture, etc)
[21:21:12] <thunder> both the elements of kindness, and the 6 basic kinds of sense (termed "custody"), are mutually prerequisite for each other to exist as sensations. that mutual prerequisite nature is what I refer to as "reciprocity", an effect which glues all components of consciousness together.
[21:22:31] <thunder> once you start applying kindness to custody, all the possible experience and sensation of a human is possible.
[21:23:30] <thunder> if you apply kindness to time, you get past (comparison) and future (choice). applied to body, space and time, you get measurement of each
[21:23:36] <apotheon> I'm not sure I get the significance of "custody".
[21:23:51] <thunder> it's just the label I've chosen for the 6 categories of sense
[21:24:07] <thunder> but the reason is because they contain all possible experience within them
[21:24:25] <apotheon> ah
[21:24:40] <thunder> so they are our ultimate custody (what we have in our keeping). the other reason for choosing that word is because of the moral attitude of "custodianship"
[21:24:44] <apotheon> Thanks for clarifying that.
[21:24:52] <thunder> np
[21:25:05] <thunder> custodianship is important both in a practical and metaphorical sense
[21:25:38] <thunder> for instance I could say that comparison is custodian of choice, because due to their reciprocity, one nurtures the other into existance
[21:25:52] <thunder> providing a guide for it's expression
[21:27:21] <thunder> similarly I might descend into the psyche and say something like emotion is custodian of thought, or the other/self to say empathy is custodian of communication
[21:27:48] <thunder> sometimes the terms related to an "is" and sometimes to an "ought" which derives from experiencing the reciprocity inherent to the "is"
[21:28:18] <thunder> anyway, that's the high level concept in a nutshell

[21:32:42] *** Joins: Chex (~Chex@user/chex)
[21:38:49] <thunder> apotheon: hume proposed this idea (not that I'm well verse with hume). basically that there requires a leap to move from "is" to "ought". from my perspective, "need" provides the initial impetus. need can be defined in this context as bodily pain associated with sustenance/survival, but also it's implications for planning in a space/time context. so, that application of pain/pleasure or need/satisfaction in the not-here-now context is fear/desire,
[21:38:49] <thunder> the latter of which is effectively the "ought".
[21:43:20] <thunder> but need and desire aren't fixed to one another exclusively. they easily become disassociated with desire taking supremacy. thus dissociated, since desire is not-here-now, it can never be satisfied in a material here-now sense. so it possesses someone with insatiability, like a frog trying to swallow the ocean.
[21:43:40] <apotheon> Are you positing some kind of ethical system based on observation of the nature of need?
[21:44:09] <thunder> yeah. after reading around as much as I could, I discovered my premise is quite similar to hedonism
[21:44:17] <apotheon> ah
[21:44:34] <thunder> in the sense that pain/pleasure experience is the underlying causal force behind morality
[21:44:56] <apotheon> The major problem with that approach to defining ethics is that there's always a fundamental uncertainty behind the human-centric needs view.
[21:45:19] <apotheon> thus the so-called "is ought fallacy"
[21:45:33] <thunder> incidentally this is why I named the first group "kindness" as a reminder of the importance of that formative concept of moral reciprocity
[21:46:12] <thunder> "human-centric needs view"?

[21:46:28] <apotheon> I took a different approach to a theory of universalized ethics, basing it on our fundamental uncertainties about what is.
[21:47:09] <thunder> part of the trouble is that need and pain aren't limited to a bodily context in english language. there's no word that's specific to only bodily pain, nor to psychic pain. so it leads to ambiguity

[21:48:48] <thunder> nice. I'll have a read. I may depart for a bit though, as I have some stuff on my plate to do besides chat
[21:49:41] <apotheon> For instance, one might be forgiven for assuming that "metaphysical" is a necessary aspect of "moral" and, thus, saying "metaphysical morality" is recursive, but my phrasing in defining the moral, the good and evil, subtly departs from that interpretation.

[21:51:11] <thunder> in parting, and on the choice of kindness and custody, one of the things which occurred in my quest for understanding is that no purely rational logical paradigm sufficiently captures the nuance of human experience. there has to be some ambiguity to provide depth of meaning, and also an appeal to emotion which is too often missing from the dry structural analyses of consciousness
[21:51:59] <thunder> I've done my best to dovetail them as much as possible in a way which adds rather than detracts from coherence

[23:48:42] <thunder> I've looked into it. some things appeal, others don't. my preference would be for a diversity of local governance modalities according to the preference of the locals. but there would also need to be a polycentric legal framework to mediate disputes across jurisdictions and issues of common pool resource access/use
[23:49:37] <thunder> that said, it would require the opening up of available lands through some redefinition of property rights, which I don't feel is feasible in the current lifetime. at least no where easily accessible to me
[23:50:12] <thunder> so I don't bank on utopia(s). I think they too often require coercive means to implement, historically.

[23:51:10] <evolv> whenever I identify, I've attached myself to something that I am not
[23:51:19] <thunder> not in depth. only in passing some years ago during my initial phase of research on such subjects
[23:51:32] <thunder> I'm not sure what the distinction is tbh

[23:51:50] <thunder> agorism, vs market-anarchism, vs etc
[23:52:08] <apotheon> That's kinda the ideal order to read them, I think, but if you *only* read one I'd recommend Second Realm.
[23:52:24] <thunder> are you familiar with transition towns, intentional communities and permaculture?
[23:52:30] <apotheon> somewhat
[23:52:43] <thunder> those to me seem like the most practical applicatoin of the ideas, at least within constraints of current society
[23:52:52] <apotheon> I think the Freedom Cells network is toying with that stuff.
[23:53:15] <thunder> they're not inherently political, but they do advocate developing independence from and resiliance against political interference
[23:53:55] <apotheon> The core of agorism, in a nutshell, is using free trade without recourse to government -- including grey and black market activity -- as an economic weapon against centralizing authoritarianism.
[23:54:03] <thunder> in order to shift society in the direction people want to go at heart, back to the land and self-sufficient community
[23:54:54] <thunder> ah. yeah. one of the best ways to get out of the unethical rat race is simply to boycott/opt-out, and use a different unregulated market
[23:55:03] <apotheon> The core of second realm strategy, in a nutshell, is using the same thing to create a parallel socioeconomic "world", not as a way to fight centralizing authoritarianism, but as a way to opt out of it.

[23:57:45] <apotheon> In a way, agorism and second realm strategy are just different ways of thinking about the same thing, with each perspective leading to different insights and benefits, while things like transition towns differ from both by being more directly interactive and compatible with centralizing authoritarianism (if only temporarily, in theory), and in needing some level of critical mass to even get
[23:57:52] <apotheon> started.
