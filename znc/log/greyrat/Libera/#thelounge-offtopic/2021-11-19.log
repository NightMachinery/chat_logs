[22:47:24] <xnaas> speaking of "rogue" activities
[22:47:38] <Activ8> yes
[22:47:53] <xnaas> had a Linode IP connect to my ircd today with realname set to "Nmap Wuz Here" lol
[22:48:13] <Activ8> is your ircd public
[22:48:20] <xnaas> indeed
[22:48:45] <Activ8> oh boy
[22:49:12] <xnaas> (un)fortunately all the bots are thwarted by /LIST being blocked for 90s for new connections :P
[22:49:34] <xnaas> so nothing too exciting ever happens
[22:50:13] <Activ8> why not whitelist a set of ips assuming your using static
[22:50:21] <Activ8> if you have a set that is
[22:50:32] <Activ8> I whitelist my stuff and only allow from my two statics
[22:51:03] <xnaas> I can't imagine telling my users "hey send me a message on Telegram every time your IP changes so I can whitelist you" lol
[22:51:16] <xnaas> that would be a great way to kill a community basically instantly, I think ðŸ˜‚
[22:51:27] <xnaas> go full Freenode on 'em
[22:51:29] <xnaas> ðŸ˜‚
[22:52:02] <Activ8> oh you got people using it
[22:52:07] <Activ8> yeh got ya
[22:55:11] <Activ8> I'm installing hyper-v just did a fresh install of LTSC 2021
[22:55:33] <Activ8> I see we have an RC.2 out so need to build a deb
