[00:06:12] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> sounds like it opened some session, lookup how to start emacs with no session
[00:08:38] <FromGitter> <agzam> maybe because of chemacs2 and another instance of Emacs running? but the sessions don't share any directories at all
[00:09:10] <FromGitter> <agzam> no, it doesn't seem like it. It keeps asking even without the second instance
[00:11:26] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> heya, anyone know, what could be responsible for changing $PATH at GUI emacs startup? is it a spacemacs thing or emacs thing? i've noticed that `(getenv "PATH")` returns items in a different order than what i see when i do `sed 's:\x0:\n:g' /proc/$EMACS_PID/environ | grep PATH`. ‚èé  ‚èé this doesn't happen in tui emacs (`emacs -nw`)
[00:13:01] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @imdoor:ilgt.lv Maybe you can fix it by doing `M-x spacemacs/force-init-spacemacs-env`
[00:16:45] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> yup, that did help, thanks! ‚èé  ‚èé i'm still curios what was causing it though
[00:19:24] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> maybe i should open an issue for that, because the changed PATH order was messing up `haskell-language-server` startup in `lsp-mode`
[00:20:01] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Emacs and Spacemacs use there own environment... you can find it in `spacemacs.env`...
[00:21:15] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> The environment is loaded into the `process-environment` variable... I guess Spacemacs creates the `spacemacs.env` for some good reason but I do not know it
[00:21:19] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> was it there by default or was it generated only when i ran `spacemacs/force-init/env`?
[00:21:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But I guess this is intended behavior
[00:21:35] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It was there by default
[00:21:38] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I think
[00:21:50] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But it got updated when to did the force thing
[00:23:28] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I don't know exactly how and why Spacemacs determines its 'personal' process-environment (and saves it into spacemacs.env)... maybe you can find it somewhere in the doc... or maybe some more knowledgeable person will step in here
[00:24:13] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Anyway... great that it fixed it for now

[00:27:27] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Just on a side note
[00:28:02] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> i just tried to delete `~/.spacemacs.env` and restart emacs. this creates a new `~/.spacemacs.env` and it also leads to a correct PATH. i guess that might mean that i had somehow messed up the PATH entry in `~/.spacemacs.env`
[00:29:12] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well yes... but this happens regularly to users... anyway therefore there is the `force init update`
[00:29:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Maybe we get wiser from that section in the documentation
[00:30:23] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> yeah, thanks for the link
[00:32:22] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well I don't see any motivation for this behavior there... but the behavior itself is quite well documented

[00:38:12] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> i was saying that i'm using the element.io app through a matrix bridge which shelters me from such issues :D
