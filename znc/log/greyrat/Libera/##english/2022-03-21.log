[05:29:28] <Jong> Has anyone here tried the dvorak keyboard layout? Is it worth the change for a more pleasant coding workflow?
[05:30:07] <twb> If you're programming and the bottleneck is your typing speed, you need a better programming language
[05:32:51] <amigojapan> Most places have query keyboards.i would hate to need to take my keyboard everywhere. Like an internet café
[05:33:05] <amigojapan> Qwerty*
[05:33:29] <twb> amigojapan: if the OS is running, you can change it in software
[05:33:55] <twb> Although reduced-size keyboards often have half-width ' key, for example, which is annoying because in dvorak that's a letter
[05:34:17] <amigojapan> I see
[05:34:18] <twb> colemak is a compromise for that
[05:34:43] <twb> But yeah if you are e.g. fixing the BIOS then often the remapping will not be done there
[05:35:04] <amigojapan> I just rather stick with the defacto standards
[05:35:44] <twb> well qwerty is only the standard in English-speaking countries and countries that do not use Latin script.
[05:36:00] <twb> e.g. in France, they use AZERTY
[05:36:05] <amigojapan> No you are wrong 
[05:36:38] <amigojapan> I am Mexican and we used qwerty and we use qwerty in Japan too 
[05:37:02] <twb> Probably due to American interference
[05:37:22] <amigojapan> If yeah France and Germany have strange keyboards
[05:37:59] <amigojapan> Yeah*
[05:40:29] <twb> Personally I would suggest https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Supported-Hardware#dedicated-machines-designed-for-use-with-plover
[05:45:53] <amigojapan> Qwerty is fast enough for most of us
[05:47:01] <twb> I'd also like a bluetooth braille reader but those are like $2000
[05:47:24] <twb> if they were $150 I'd probably just buy one to fuck around

[06:22:55] <amigojapan> LjL: but you can use speech synthesis way much more affordably with speech synthesis
[06:23:20] <amigojapan> Err
[06:23:53] <amigojapan> I just mean you don't need to spend 2000 dollars or learn a cryptic reading system
[06:24:56] <LjL> amigojapan, i'm sure the expense is annoying, but i suspect people who have invested the effort to learn Braille, which they probably do anyway for other reason, will often find it easier to sift through text with braille than listening to espeak
[06:25:07] <LjL> i'm not blind, i don't know braille, so i don't know first hand
[06:25:16] <LjL> i know that i have no patience for listening to speech synthesizer
[06:26:02] <amigojapan> Alright
[06:26:57] <LjL> I've asked this question a few times in here, I guess nobody can dissect my brain and give me the answer, or meaningful hints besides "try to stop doing that"
[06:27:17] <LjL> but why the FLIP do I mess up all the plurals
[06:27:32] <LjL> by making them singular, when they should be plural, but often enough also vice versa
[06:27:38] <LjL> I did it at least twice in just the above
[06:27:56] <LjL> I also do it with verb third persons, so it's something with the -s morpheme, not plurals per se, I guess
[06:28:12] <LjL> my native language has plural and conjugates verbs, so it's not that I have trouble with the concept
[06:28:34] <twb> amigojapan: TTS is kinda crap for some things
[06:28:40] <LjL> but it's also not just typos, because I notice that when I do it with words like, I dunno, "liberties", I'll write "liberty", not "libertie", so it's about grammar
[06:29:02] <twb> amigojapan: also you are probably thinking of the TTS that Google provides which works by sending all your private info to google to render it in a big server
[06:30:10] <LjL> twb, Italy also uses QWERTY at present although typewriters had a slightly different layout, and indeed Spain uses QWERTY. Whether American influence is involved seems inconsequential, as *all* the layouts in questions (including AZERTY) are derived from QWERTY anyway

[06:30:39] <twb> personally I still use festival with nitech hts and I find flite and espeak raelly annoying
[06:30:52] <LjL> it sounds like crap but you can make it speak much much faster while letting it continue sounding equally crap

[07:14:17] <amigojapan> LjL: the culture here in Japan is very different. In Mexico everyone tries to get out of their homes during an earthquake. In Japan nobody does that
[07:14:22] <LjL> amigojapan, pretty shitty of a radio station to mock your voice tbh
[07:14:32] <LjL> amigojapan, because it's silly :P
[07:14:43] <Maxdamantus> I've been using Dvorak for about 13 years. I'd say it's not worth it unless you're just interested in using another layout.
[07:14:44] <twb> I bet it was a commercial radio station instead of an independent radio station
[07:15:13] <Maxdamantus> I think I was mostly just interested in doing things differently.
[07:15:20] <Jong> Thanks Maxdamantus 
[07:15:23] <LjL> amigojapan, also because in japan, buildings don't tend to collapse as much ;(
[07:15:30] <Maxdamantus> and figuring out what it's like to learn how to type again.
[07:15:36] <amigojapan> LjL: I would have laughed at them if I was an adult. But I was like 12 years old. So I was very embarrassed
[07:15:53] <LjL> but then again, even if they do tend to collapse, unless you can be out *and* clear of buildings by the time the S-waves hit, you're likely just putting yourself in more danger by running out
[07:16:03] <LjL> amigojapan, yeah, hence shitty

[07:17:29] <Maxdamantus> Though I guess on Android, the Dvorak layout is marginally better for coding, since it has '\'', '"', '<', '>' more easily accessible, but for programming on Android you'd probably want more keys than that (I have additional keys accessible in termux).
[07:17:40] <amigojapan> twb: it was some show where they took calls form the public and people told scary stories, the name of the show was "la mano peluda
[07:20:43] <twb> huh, "mano" is feminine
[07:21:25] <amigojapan> Yes 
[07:22:36] <amigojapan> The rule of words ending with o being masculine is only a rule of thumb
[07:22:51] <amigojapan> It has exceptions
[07:22:57] <LjL> is that why thumb is masculine
[07:23:11] <amigojapan> Lol
[07:24:07] *** Joins: jos2 (~jos3@dyndsl-091-248-055-073.ewe-ip-backbone.de)
[07:24:27] <LjL> manus was a feminine 4th declension noun
[07:24:32] <twb> amigojapan: oh of course
[07:24:33] <LjL> 4th declension nouns weren't very common
[07:24:42] <LjL> and they got even less common in romance languages
[07:24:42] <twb> amigojapan: but the exceptions are rare enough to make me go "huh"
[07:25:02] <LjL> so i'd say mano is probably the only basic word that is like that
[07:25:19] <twb> "problema" is the other one (the other way) that I always remember
[07:25:41] <twb> Because the simpsons had a catchphrase that sounded wrong
[07:25:44] <LjL> well that one is useful because there's a ton of greek loanwords that are like that
[07:25:47] <amigojapan> Ah yes twb
[07:26:31] <amigojapan> Sofá is also a masculine word
[07:26:58] <LjL> with words that end in a stressed vowel it would be wise to disregard any rules of thumb
[07:27:18] <amigojapan> Alright LjL 
[07:29:10] <LjL> there are also some words, like sea and flower are the ones that usually come to mind, that were neuter in latin and became either masculine or feminine in romance languages but depending on the language, so they are confusing for romance speakers
[07:29:15] <LjL> (learning another romance language)
[07:29:37] <amigojapan> There is no real reason I know if why words end up being masculine or feminine that I know of. It seems to be pretty random. This was one thing that my students asked a lot when I was teaching Spanish
[07:30:12] <LjL> need to go back to PIE
[07:30:19] <LjL> and even then, it's random :P

[07:32:04] <twb> amigojapan: in French at least it was based on the word endings in *old* french
[07:32:19] <twb> amigojapan: but because the language changed and the gendering did not, now it's just fucking confusing
[07:32:36] <LjL> it really wasn't, though
[07:32:45] <LjL> it was based on what the word genders were in latin
[07:32:49] <LjL> which ended up affecting word endings, sure
[07:33:02] <LjL> but like in spanish and italian and... everything, it was always a rule of thumb
[07:33:11] <twb> OK
[07:33:21] <twb> LjL: would it be fair to say it was more regular, at least?
[07:33:35] <LjL> because back with latin declensions already, you could have 1st declension words (usually feminine) that were masculine, and 3rd and 4th declensions words where you couldn't really know automatically
[07:33:41] <LjL> twb, probably
[07:33:50] <amigojapan> But the hardest thing about teaching Spanish was making sense of verb conjugations
[07:33:51] <LjL> but no more regular than in modern spanish
[07:35:13] <LjL> romance verbs are the worst ;(

[07:37:07] <LjL> such as the past perfect and past participles of... most verbs, really
[07:37:16] <LjL> they're just what they are, and you can't derive them from the verb infinitive
[07:37:35] <amigojapan> And Spanish has so many irregular verbs
[07:38:02] <LjL> yes but even the ones not normally called "irregular", their past forms still cannot be derived using rules in many cases
[07:38:20] <LjL> like, "ser" and "ir" are obviously irregular in just about every possible way
[07:38:32] <LjL> but more harmless verbs are just... less irregular
[07:39:10] <LjL> in my area of Italy we don't really use the simple past, we use the present perfect (using english terms, but basically, not "fue" but "ha sido")
[07:39:19] <amigojapan> LjL: you memorize the suffix of another regular verb then attach that to another regular verb
[07:39:31] <LjL> and as a consequence, people often have no idea how to make the simple past of verbs
[07:40:10] <amigojapan> I see
[07:40:31] <LjL> i can't confidently make examples in Spanish, but i don't think it's that easy in many cases
[07:40:38] <LjL> cuocere, cocer, cook
[07:40:45] <LjL> it's not considered an irregular verb per se
[07:40:57] <LjL> but "I cooked" is "io cossi" and "I have cooked" is "io ho cotto"
[07:41:11] <LjL> it's not exactly straightforward where cossi and cotto are pulled from out of cuocere
[07:42:36] <twb> IME the newer the word is the more likely it is to be regular
[07:42:55] <twb> But oldest words are used to the most basic things, so you need to know them :P
[07:45:01] <amigojapan> Lol cocer is to cook in Spanish and coser is to sew
[07:46:01] <amigojapan> I hate letters that have the same sound 
[07:48:05] <amigojapan> twb: día is also masculine
[07:50:13] <twb> Nice
[07:51:34] <LjL> amigojapan, well maybe you should try speaking real spanish where they have different sounds
[07:51:36] <LjL> :x
[07:52:06] <amigojapan> True LjL 
[07:52:20] <twb> can't trust castellan – they killd Dr Who

[08:01:15] <amigojapan> And we should just get rid of H
[08:01:20] <LjL> amigojapan, that may date back to very ancient times, https://www.reddit.com/r/es/comments/9ebxwd/los_romanos_bromeaban_con_la_manera_que_ten%C3%ADan/
[08:02:07] <LjL> Italian largely got rid of H except in the verb to have, and for the "ch" digraph but that's just the way we write /k/ (without the H it can sound like /tS/ which is, err, spanish "ch")
[08:02:08] <amigojapan> Let me see 
[08:02:46] <LjL> but italian has a bunch of other spelling irregularities that spanish doesn't have
[08:02:53] <amigojapan> I thought Ch was ci in Italian
[08:03:26] <LjL> amigojapan, ci or ce, basically if c is before i or e, it sounds like spanish "ch", so to make it *not* sound like spanish "ch", we write chi or che
[08:04:10] <LjL> it's the same think you do by writing qui and que, the only confusing part is we do it by using the same "ch" you use to make the sound we try to avoid by writing "ch"
[08:04:16] <LjL> thing*
[08:04:36] <LjL> chi = quien, che = que
[08:04:49] <amigojapan> Ah gotcha
[08:05:28] <amigojapan> In Spanish we write capuchino instead of capucino
[08:06:17] <LjL> yes that makes sense, but an italian would read that as capuquino
[08:06:37] <LjL> (although we're pretty used to "ch" being the way it is in spanish, due to english)
[08:07:15] <amigojapan> I see
[08:08:03] <amigojapan> LjL: does capuchino have anything to do with capucha? Head cover?
[08:08:18] <LjL> yes
[08:08:21] *** Quits: CuriosTiger (~stian@peterbilt.bigrig.org) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:08:27] <LjL> at least i think so
[08:08:49] <LjL> the word in italian is cappuccio
[08:08:59] <LjL> so cappuccino is a diminutive of that (like capuchina?)
[08:09:04] <LjL> capuchita*
[08:09:29] <LjL> From cappuccio (“hood, cowl”) +‎ -ino. The coffee name gets its name from the colour of the beverage, which is reminiscent of the colour of monks' habits.[1]
[08:10:13] <LjL> cappuccino is pretty awesome but it usually hurts my stomach
[08:10:48] <amigojapan> Ouch
[08:10:56] <amigojapan> I love It
[08:11:12] <LjL> maybe i have a bit of lactose intolerance
[08:11:44] <amigojapan> But my other Italian friend said my way of making it is blasphemy 
[08:11:51] <amigojapan> Ouch
[08:12:06] <LjL> but then again jus a nice cup of espresso is nice too, as long (in my book) as it's larger than the really tiny couple of drops of coffee they usually give you in italy when you ask for an espresso
[08:12:19] <amigojapan> LjL: I use a froather which is like a batterer
[08:12:30] <LjL> amigojapan, well... to make it properly you need to be able to make espresso, which require a dedicated machine
[08:12:50] <amigojapan> Right
[08:12:56] <LjL> a milk froather yeah... i think that's how it's normally done?
[08:14:09] <amigojapan> Ljl this machine IKEA PRODUKT 70301165 Milk Frother, Black https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00VQ1MSMK/
[08:14:49] <LjL> italians could benefit sometimes from being a bit less uh religious about food and drink
[08:14:55] <amigojapan> LjL: he said you make the foam by carefully warning milk until it froaths
[08:15:06] <amigojapan> I see
[08:15:07] <LjL> although i get triggered too a little when people say something is italian x and y when really it's nothing like it :P
[08:15:30] <LjL> amigojapan, i'm pretty sure that's not how they make it in any café!
[08:15:44] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[08:15:49] <LjL> unless it's like a €5 espresso maybe, who knows what fancy people do :P
[08:16:55] <amigojapan> LjL: I am already used to people saying Japanese do X y and z too and it is totally different
[08:16:56] <LjL> appuccino traditionally has a layer of textured milk microfoam exceeding 1 cm in thickness; microfoam is frothed/steamed milk in which the bubbles are so small and so numerous that they are not seen, but it makes the milk lighter and thicker.
[08:17:13] <LjL> i think you can have better or worse frothing techniques but all in all, meh
[08:17:38] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[08:17:46] <LjL> but i would say that unless the coffee base is not espresso, it probably isn't entirely proper to call it cappuccino
[08:18:02] <LjL> so like moka coffee with frother milk on top is... moka coffee with frothed milk on top :P
[08:18:15] <amigojapan> LjL: I like to take Italians to saizeria,a Japanese Italian restaurant
[08:19:07] <amigojapan> LjL: I did it to many Italians who came to the conversation cafe in Tokyo
[08:19:46] <LjL> chain restaurants are a bit sad though ;(
[08:19:50] <LjL> not necessarily bad
[08:20:12] <LjL> but the thing about going to italian restaurants is you don't know what you're getting
[08:20:27] <LjL> sometimes that's not a good thing :P
[08:20:45] <LjL> but sometimes if you're touring places and you find good restaurants, at least for me, it's been the part of the experience that i remember the most
[08:21:41] <LjL> like that restaurant in Siena with mushroom-topped bruschetta, and the one in Florence who randomly served friend sage for free
[08:21:53] <LjL> i had no idea what it even was, felt like potato crisps but better
[08:23:14] <LjL> but at the same time, it's silly to be like "you can only have good italian food in italy"
[08:23:18] <LjL> i had the best pasta dish ever in greece
[08:23:39] <LjL> in a restaurant specializing in pasta, i can't even say what was so good about it, but it was perfect
[08:23:40] <amigojapan> LjL: It's funny to see Italians react to Japanese interpretations of Italian food
[08:23:56] <LjL> i bet
[08:24:08] <LjL> but i also bet Japanese people would be perplexed at Japanese restaurants in Italy :P
[08:24:13] <amigojapan> LjL: for example spaghetti Napolitano 
[08:24:27] <pussipupu> or at Finnish sushi
[08:25:00] <LjL> all-you-can-eat sushi is very popular in Milan
[08:25:06] <LjL> but i think they should probably put hospitals next to it
[08:25:18] <amigojapan> LjL: that is a spaghetti that uses ketchup instead of tomato sauce
[08:25:26] <LjL> yuk
[08:25:41] <LjL> that is just the italian stereotype of terrible "italian" foreign food :P
[08:26:17] <amigojapan> LjL: or Milan style Doria. Which I heard does not exist in Milan 
[08:26:28] <LjL> i have no idea what Doria means
[08:26:37] <LjL> and i am from Milan
[08:27:03] <LjL> i'm not sure i could recommend food that is originally *from* milan, for the most part, as it involves a lot of offal :P
[08:27:10] <LjL> but, i guess, risotto
[08:27:20] <LjL> ... with offal
[08:27:34] <LjL> nah okay with mushrooms or something
[08:28:48] <amigojapan> Ljl this is a picture of Milano style Doria https://images.app.goo.gl/zxcrtaw8Vjbxvvhu5
[08:29:23] <amigojapan> LjL: Doria is a kind of dry rissoto
[08:30:20] <LjL> uh that looks... potentially appetizing, but like nothing i recognize, certainly not risotto
[08:30:29] <LjL> it kinda looks like hardcore lasagna
[08:30:30] <amigojapan> LjL: and that is white sauce and meat sauce baked with safran rice
[08:30:56] <amigojapan> Interesting reaction
[08:30:57] <LjL> okay, saffron at least is something typical enough of Milanese risotto
[08:31:07] <amigojapan> Nice
[08:32:09] <amigojapan> LjL: would you try it?
[08:32:14] <LjL> sure
[08:32:20] <amigojapan> Nice
[08:32:39] <LjL>  https://rocketnews24.com/2015/09/24/637439/ is this comparing doria with actual saffron risotto?
[08:32:45] <LjL> because the second picture looks like saffron risotto
[08:32:58] <amigojapan> Let me see
[08:33:47] <amigojapan> Yeah that looks really creammy
[08:35:49] <amigojapan> LjL: altho that picture does not show the rice under the meat sauce
[08:36:26] <LjL> i got the article google translated
[08:36:34] <LjL> indeed a restaurant in Milan would have no clue what doria is
[08:36:50] <LjL> but the person still fared better than me at Pizza Hut in Edinburgh
[08:37:07] <LjL> it took me like two minutes to understand that the waiter was asking me whether i wanted as smokers' or non-smokers' table

[09:41:36] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9chamel_sauce
[09:41:38] <CuriosTiger> My favorite French expression is eau de toilette
[09:41:48] <CuriosTiger> It means perfume, but the literal translation is "water of toilet"
[09:42:00] <twb> CuriosTiger: well that's because "toilet" has changed meaning
[09:42:05] <CuriosTiger> (In French, "toilette" refers to the bathroom rather than just the shitter.)
[09:42:28] <CuriosTiger> twb: Be that as it may, it's nevertheless amusing.
[09:42:29] <twb> "toilette (“small cloth”), diminutive of toile (“cloth”), from their use to protect clothing while shaving or arranging hair."
[09:42:38] <CuriosTiger> Oh, is that what it was originally?
[09:42:41] <CuriosTiger> Cool.
[09:42:54] <twb> Like how people talk about "powder room"
[09:43:19] <amigojapan> In Spanish you can say toallita 
[09:43:26] <CuriosTiger> On a slightly related note, I was amused to discover that in Australia, a napkin is a serviette.
[09:43:27] <twb> And "lavatory" refers to washing, not shitting
[09:43:35] <CuriosTiger> also from a French diminutive for a small protective cloth.
[09:43:47] <twb> "lavatorium" – wash-room 
[09:43:50] <CuriosTiger> twb: Right, you'd still say "lavar" meaning "to clean" in Spanish.
[09:43:56] <CuriosTiger> derived from that Latin verb.
[09:44:59] <amigojapan> CuriosTiger: in Spanish you also say servilleta 
[09:45:14] <amigojapan> For napkin
[09:45:16] <twb> I made roo ragù alla bolognese last week, but I used too much red wine
[09:45:30] <CuriosTiger> amigojapan : In multiple other languages as well. Norwegian has serviett, German does as well.
[09:46:08] <twb> "serviette" is more common than "napkin" in Australia, too
[09:46:13] <CuriosTiger> amigojapan: With a lot of words like this, I find they're the same in like 9 out of 10 European languages, even across language families, due to the extensive borrowings. And the outlier is English more often than not.
[09:46:30] <CuriosTiger> twb: Yeah, Australia was what I was noting originally above.
[09:46:36] <CuriosTiger> It's the first place I heard that word used in English.
[09:46:49] <twb> Ah sorry I missed that line

[09:58:32] <CuriosTiger> Since "å" and "le" happen to be valid words in Norwegian with entirely different meaning, that phrase winds up meaning something like "coffee to laugh [at]"
[09:58:47] <CuriosTiger> nevertheless, you can find it on signs and menus.
[09:58:57] <twb> "coffee" seems like a nasty word to localize in general
[09:59:06] <amigojapan> CuriosTiger: they write it in katakana here with the equivalent of "cafe ole"

[09:59:48] <CuriosTiger> café or kafé, taken from French with or without a Norwegianified k -- and also causing confusion with café taken from English, which means, well, café (coffee shop)
[10:00:06] <CuriosTiger> then there's kaffe -- no accent, double f to fit Norwegian spelling standards.
[10:00:24] <amigojapan> A few places use the Kanji 珈琲 for coffee
[10:00:26] <CuriosTiger> and then there's kaffi, which is the more common pronunciation, but not really an acceptable spelling.
[10:00:40] <CuriosTiger> Korean does kopi as well
[10:00:41] <amigojapan> It's still pronounced koohii
[10:01:14] <CuriosTiger> 커피 in Korean -- pronounced something like khophi with aspirated stops.
[10:01:34] <CuriosTiger> Korean has no F.
[10:02:05] <CuriosTiger> but they have three different P's :P
[10:02:19] <twb> well, ish
[10:02:21] <amigojapan> And for some reason nobody knows, tobacco is often written in hiragana outside convenience stores as たばこ
[10:02:56] <CuriosTiger> That's one reason I haven't visited Japan yet. I hear they smoke like chimneys.
[10:03:00] <CuriosTiger> And that causes rather big problems for me.
[10:03:27] <twb> Even in Australia, smoking is still like 1 in 3 people, and we're the lowest worldwide
[10:03:45] <CuriosTiger> I found Australia to be comparable to the US in that regard.
[10:03:52] <amigojapan> CuriosTiger: Japanese arguably had an f in the hiragana fire ふ only
[10:03:53] <CuriosTiger> Smoking in public was not common.
[10:04:31] <CuriosTiger> Of course, in the US they seem determined to make marijuana the new tobacco.
[10:04:33] <amigojapan> CuriosTiger: that is changing, they made smoking in restaurants illegal now

[10:07:26] <blkshp> IT definitely does not mean underwater.
[10:07:28] <CuriosTiger> but Americans do know the word trousers, it's just not common.
[10:07:39] <twb> That was clearly a typo for "underwear"
[10:07:39] <blkshp> CuriosTiger: lol
[10:07:50] <blkshp> Not clearly at all.
[10:08:14] <CuriosTiger> the word I *never* hear in the US is knickers.
[10:08:15] <blkshp> It could feasibly mean underwater :P

[10:08:29] <amigojapan> Right underwear*

[10:09:04] <CuriosTiger> What do they say in Scotland?
[10:09:17] <blkshp> For what?
[10:09:22] <CuriosTiger> "trousers"
[10:09:27] <twb>  1. (chiefly Canada, US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Cumbria, Lancashire, Liverpudlian, Manchester) An outer garment that covers the body⋯
[10:09:29] <blkshp> Troo-ziz
[10:09:35] <twb> "trews"
[10:09:46] <CuriosTiger> Norwegian, btw, uses "truse" -- etymologically related, I bet -- to mean underwear.
[10:09:48] <twb> (not really)
[10:10:04] <twb> From Scottish Gaelic triubhas, from Middle Irish triubus.  ==>  1. (Britain) trousers, especially if close fitting and tartan.
[10:10:10] <CuriosTiger> twb: I was expecting Scotland to have a completely alien word.
[10:10:26] <CuriosTiger> Oh, trousers is of Gaelic origin?
[10:10:44] <twb> So it would appear
[10:10:57] <twb> cf. "sans-culottes"
[10:11:21] <CuriosTiger> then troo-ziz is not a bad guess. :P
[10:11:30] <twb> Which meant "poor people" by way of "they're so poor they have to wear trousers instead of shorts + stockings"
[10:12:20] <amigojapan> twb: what do they mean by "shorts"in that sentence?
[10:12:29] <CuriosTiger> Hrm. I think there is a Swedish word that's cognate with that.
[10:12:30] <twb> amigojapan: well a more precise word is "breeches"
[10:12:30] <blkshp> (it wasn't a guess!)
[10:12:45] <amigojapan> Ah gotcha
[10:12:58] <twb> amigojapan: nowadays this is a fashion only worn by women where they are called "capris"
[10:13:10] <blkshp> Shorts are short trousers
[10:13:11] <twb> (also I guess breechers were tight-fitting?)
[10:13:21] <twb> Right.  "shorts" = "short trousers"

[10:47:28] <amigojapan> ok and 2?
[10:48:22] <twb> 2 is "some clean white people found some water and some dirty white people try to steal it because they live in a desert and white people suck at deserts"

[11:17:19] <blkshp> darsie: ping
[11:17:25] <darsie> .
[11:17:28] <twb> But you're talking about putting human fat in an ICE
[11:17:31] * CuriosTiger gives blkshp his vertigo.
[11:17:47] <twb> So for that to be worthwhile, you would need to get out more energy than you put in
[11:17:57] * blkshp punches darsie in the eye
[11:18:12] <blkshp> CuriosTiger: i don't need to feel any more nauseous thanks
[11:18:43] * darsie is afraid of blkshp.
[11:19:10] <amigojapan> twb: and also, as I said, I dont remember such a fule being used in the move, but i may have not cought that part
[11:19:16] <CuriosTiger> darsie: He's kind of dangerous for an ovine.
[11:19:51] <twb> Took me a moment to recognize "ovine" without "-omancy" on the end
[11:20:05] <CuriosTiger> ..
[11:20:23] <Me-me> !define ovine
[11:20:38] <amigojapan> twb: why is it worth to make fuel out of ramen broth then?
[11:21:13] <twb> amigojapan: it's probably not
[11:21:23] <amigojapan> ah ok
[11:21:36] <Me-me> "Worth" is relative.
[11:21:44] <twb> amigojapan: biogas is generally hard to make pay for itself unless it's using stuff that someone would otherwise throw away
[11:22:07] <amigojapan> twb ramen broth is thrown away otherewise
[11:22:11] <twb> Right
[11:22:16] <twb> But say that powers 20 trucks
[11:22:31] <twb> if he buys another 20 trucks next year, he cannot make the ramen factory throw away twice as much
[11:22:48] <amigojapan> ok
[11:22:49] <twb> so it works but only up to a point
[11:22:51] <Me-me> Why would he need to expand?
[11:22:56] <amigojapan> gotcha
[11:22:58] <Me-me> Fill a niche.
[11:23:02] <twb> You could not e.g. convert EVERY truck from petrol to ramen
[11:23:08] <Me-me> Sure.
[11:23:10] <CuriosTiger> I wonder what ramen exhaust smells like. Probably spicy.
[11:23:29] <twb> Like someone cranked the numbers for how much soy you'd need to grow to turn it all into biofuel to replace ALL petrol
[11:23:33] <CuriosTiger> These are very strange musings that are not helping my nausea.
[11:23:43] <twb> And it was roughly equivalent to turning all the planet's water surface into soy farm
[11:24:00] <amigojapan> sorry CuriosTiger
[11:24:24] <CuriosTiger> I think I will reattempt sleep.
[11:24:26] <twb> In terms of energy efficiency (i.e. system losses), *by far* the most efficient system is the safety bicycle
[11:24:33] <Me-me> CuriosTiger: Good luck, and godspeed.
[11:24:35] <amigojapan> sleep weel CuriosTiger
[11:24:50] <CuriosTiger> thanks
[11:24:52] <CuriosTiger> g'night
[11:25:02] <twb> In terms of cargo transport, by far the most efficient is the cargo ship (and trucks are the worst)
[11:25:37] <twb> It's actually more energy efficient to send stuff to a port and then have them sail along the cost and then go back into the same country, than it is to run a railway line down the same distance
[11:26:04] <twb> (Actually, I tell a lie – rockets and planes are less efficient than trucks)
[11:26:22] <Me-me> Well. Until we make maglev trains more common.
[11:26:31] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[11:26:48] <amigojapan> Me-me: I think he was talking about rtucks not trains, tho he used the word "rail"
[11:26:56] <amigojapan> trucks*
[11:27:29] <Me-me> Well, I assume he was equating trucks and trains, as both overland methods require fighting the friction coefficient of solids, as opposed to the liquids of the water.
[11:27:29] <amigojapan> trains are very efficient
[11:27:43] <twb> I also worked out how big the battery of my dad's new car is, in potatos
[11:28:04] <twb> His Kia EV6 battery is equivalent to 16 kg of potatoes
[11:28:10] <Me-me> Trucks are the least efficient, but magnetic levitation would make for a near-negligible friction, beating out even water-based transport.
[11:28:29] <twb> Me-me: how do you brake
[11:28:42] <amigojapan> ah ok Me-me
[11:28:42] <Me-me> Haha! Point the magnets the other way.
[11:28:43] <twb> Me-me: also aren't maglevs *powered* magnets?
[11:28:59] <twb> i.e. electromagnets
[11:29:11] <Me-me> I think? But that can still be efficient. Electric cars are more efficient than combustion engine cars already.
[11:29:36] <amigojapan> twb: you could have non powered magnets moost of the way, and only electormagnets where you need to stop, tho this may be dangerous
[11:29:38] <twb> "At low speeds the percentage of power used for levitation can be significant, consuming up to 15% more power than a subway or light rail service.[79]"
[11:29:53] <twb> So cargo ships will still win except for urgent cargo
[11:30:41] <twb> Why don't maglev trains use WIG effect?
[11:30:48] <Me-me> That's low speeds, though. It's going to be more efficient at higher speeds, which makes for more efficient trips overall.
[11:31:23] <twb> Me-me: sure but most cargo ships operate on like 9 month delivery schedule
[11:31:27] <Me-me> I mean I'm not an expert. My understanding of the basics is that it makes sense in principle that maglev trains are more efficient.
[11:31:31] <amigojapan> Me-me: I think some trains in Japan are already maglev
[11:31:36] <Me-me> twb: Yeah, running the engines the whole way.
[11:31:40] <Me-me> amigojapan: I have heard this, also.
[11:31:45] <twb> Me-me: but running them very very very slow
[11:32:12] <twb> Me-me: like... describing it naively: if you run to your mum's house, it uses a lot more energy than if you walk
[11:32:15] <Me-me> twb: The logistics of going slower doesn't mean you're consuming less power on the trip as a whole.
[11:32:37] <amigojapan> Me-me: well, sail is kind of free power tho
[11:32:46] <Me-me> I mean sure.
[11:32:49] <amigojapan> if you use actual sails
[11:32:51] <twb> Me-me: even with regenerative braking, system losses mean (I strongly suspect) that a maglev at any speed will be less energy-efficient in kilogram-metres-per-joule than cargo ship
[11:33:31] <Me-me> I suppose, given that this is something neither of us have definitive data or authoritative education on, we would have to do more science in order to settle the disagreement.
[11:33:38] <amigojapan> you could theoretically use sail on a magleg train too
[11:33:45] <twb> amigojapan: modern cargo ships are too heavy for that to be really worthwhile, although they do use satellite information to try to make sure they get in a "lane" that has a tailwind and equivlent water stream
[11:33:56] <Me-me> amigojapan: Yeah, but you're running the maglev the whole way.
[11:34:11] <amigojapan> ah ok twb
[11:34:26] <amigojapan> Me-me: no, you could use non electric magnets
[11:34:43] <twb> AFAICT nobody has built a maglev with permanent magnets
[11:34:57] <twb> If those were A ThingTM I might be more convinced
[11:35:00] <amigojapan> but it is possible
[11:35:03] <twb> amigojapan: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skimmerfoil_Jorg_IV-001.jpg
[11:35:56] <Me-me> Yeah, permanent magnet trains would definitely be best.

[11:44:36] <Me-me> I don't know that internal consistency is necessarily limited to premises.

[19:25:47] <blkshp> So I may not be the best person to ask.
[19:25:51] <furrykef> A full stop breaks the flow too much, IMO
[19:25:52] <furrykef> mm
[19:26:11] <blkshp> I think people reading it would be hung up on why a colon would have been used.
[19:27:49] <furrykef> Because it expands on the "large number's they've got" bit
[19:28:14] <TimMc> I think a colon is OK here.
[19:28:32] <TimMc> I'd capitalize the next letter after it, though.

[19:28:42] <TimMc> (standard rules for colon)

[19:29:47] <blkshp> It can be a complete sentence but doesn't need to be
[19:30:01] <Bayes> also, an alternative could be -- ? I also like the double dash for some reason
[19:30:15] <blkshp> But then, as I said, I use them infrequently for this and generally just go for a sentence end.
[19:30:36] <Bayes> also I'm not a native nor a language savvy so I'm totally off my depth:D  take it as a layman opinion
[19:31:14] <furrykef> Bayes: I wouldn't use a dash here because of the other dash in the sentence.
[19:31:32] <furrykef> It would make "and large numbers they've got" look like a parenthetical, which it isn't.
[19:31:36] <Bayes> oh yeah I meant a bit more generally
[19:32:05] <furrykef> Yeah, I'd probably use a dash there, too, were it not for that. But I probably overuse dashes.
[19:32:27] <furrykef> I could make the first dash a comma and then change the colon to a dash...

[20:17:49] <Tirili> Is the comma wrong?
[20:18:26] <Tirili> I thought you have to separate two to full sentences that are connected via "and" by a comma.
[20:18:28] <Tirili> in English
[20:19:25] <LuisR14> "full sentences"
[20:19:44] <Tirili> so the missing "I" destroys the "fullness"?
[20:20:34] <Tirili> By "full", I mean "complete", i.e. the sentence has a subject and verb.

[21:31:11] <LjL> but also, one of my rules of thumb, if you want to say something like "I can't wait to...", then "I can't wait to..." is probably a decent option
[21:31:25] <LjL> people often come here asking "how can i say <perfectly valid thing they can say>" :P
[21:32:50] <Tirili> It's about the "Profile" section in a dutch cv - just in English language.
[21:33:05] <Hazey_Dream> Unrelatedly: In "not a problem", "a" isn't a verb, right?
[21:33:06] * LjL disagrees with LuisR14's view of what counts as a subclause, for the record
[21:33:23] <LjL> also with the comma not being okay!
[21:33:33] <Hazey_Dream> Is there a verb in "It is not a problem"?
[21:33:37] <pussipupu> "a" is an article
[21:33:45] <LjL> it's not a serial comma, it is certainly not required, but i don't see it as problematic
[21:33:58] <LjL> (*this* just above is a serial comma)
[21:34:12] <LjL> Hazey_Dream, "is" is a verb
[21:34:20] <LjL> "not a problem" doesn't have a verb, though
[21:34:39] <LjL> sometimes "is" is called a copula, but in English, the copula definitely behaves a lot like any other verb

[23:49:12] <pussipupu> Vaccination doesn't bring total immunity, though also other viruses are available
