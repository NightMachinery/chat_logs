[01:18:02] <gwozniak> I have a bit of info on some drama afoot, but this post is not really helping me understand much of what is going on
[01:18:23] <imode> jesus.
[01:19:02] <gwozniak> I'm a little over 1/3 of the way through and I think it is, just now, getting to something... useful?
[01:21:36] <imode> I noped out. yikes.
[01:21:55] <manicennui> I find that most open source drama is nonsense that I'm better off not knowing about
[01:32:02] <gwozniak> I gave up on that post.  It's bloviated stream of consciousness
[01:32:13] <gwozniak> Got about halfway
[01:32:32] <gwozniak> And really, I kind of don't care about ASDF that much anyway
[01:35:04] <manicennui> Does anyone?
[01:35:12] <manicennui> I thought that SBCL was kind of what everyone uses.
[01:35:45] <manicennui> Oh, that is some kind of dependency manager?
[01:37:11] <imode> build system iirc.
[01:37:16] <gwozniak> ASDF is used by all the commercial lisp implementations
[01:37:36] <gwozniak> It's used by pretty much all of them, whether commercial or not

[01:52:05] <manicennui> https://consequence.net/2022/01/old-music-70-percent-share-of-market/
[01:52:07] <buttsbot> - 	Old Music Now Makes Up Nearly 70% of American Consumption: Report
[01:53:49] <indigo> > “old” music — released more than 18 months ago
[01:55:11] <indigo> Interesting definition
[01:55:47] <Brekkjern> Could they not have gone with 5 years at least?
[01:56:32] <manicennui> The original article goes into more depth. It's hard to draw any hard conclusions, but he implies that music from 50 years ago is very popular.
[01:56:42] <manicennui> The hottest area of investment in the music business is old songs—with investment firms getting into bidding wars to buy publishing catalogs from aging rock and pop stars.
[01:56:48] <manicennui> The song catalogs in most demand are by musicians in their 70s or 80s (Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, etc.)—if not already dead (David Bowie, James Brown, etc.).
[01:59:59] <gwozniak> I admit that I haven't listened to that stuff in ages
[02:00:09] <manicennui> This is from the original source of the data: For the first time since MRC Data began tracking streaming music in 2008, the audio streaming of Current music (music released less than 18 months ago) actually declined.
[02:01:35] <Brekkjern> Well, it's not like anything new was released the last 18 months...
[02:01:59] <manicennui> A lot was.
[02:02:05] <Brekkjern> Shush
[02:02:09] <Brekkjern> Nothing happened
[02:02:12] <Brekkjern> Nothing at all
[02:02:21] <manicennui> Nothing worthwhile, sure.
[02:02:49] <Brekkjern> That is absolutely true
[02:03:09] <Brekkjern> It still fascinates me that the Arcane album hit #16 on global charts
[02:03:10] <manicennui> I think we are past blaming the pandemic though.
[02:10:17] <gwozniak> Most of the new music I listen to would probably never be all that popular, so I'm a terrible gauge for new music
[02:10:34] <gwozniak> But that's mainly because pop music just doesn't do it for me
[02:10:53] <gwozniak> And classic rock is something I never need to hear again
[02:11:06] <Brekkjern> The release date of the music is really an irrelevant metric for me
[02:11:32] <Brekkjern> I just have Spotify suggest new things for me and listen through it to find new stuff. If I like it, I add it to a playlist.
[02:11:42] <Brekkjern> End up with a lot of random shit that I like that way
[02:12:10] <gwozniak> I have never used Spotify, or any streaming service for that matter
[02:12:23] <gwozniak> Well, Bandcamp has a streaming thing but I never use it
[02:12:39] <Brekkjern> I hadn't before I had :P
[02:12:58] <manicennui> There is enough good music/movies/TV/books to last several lifetimes. It's kind of a weird situation.
[02:13:09] <manicennui> If it all stopped getting made, I'd never run out of things to consume.
[02:13:10] <gwozniak> I have a few hundred hours of music available to me, so I don't see much value in Spotify
[02:13:33] <gwozniak> Plus, I'm not keen on how little artists get from it
[02:13:56] <Brekkjern> I mean, they get more money than they would if I didn't use it...
[02:14:27] <Brekkjern> I've had Spotify premium since I got it back when it was in beta IIRC.
[02:14:36] <gwozniak> It's still next to nothing.  Various local musicians have said things about this in the local paper.  It's literally pennies.
[02:14:42] <manicennui> I used rdio, and switched to spotify when rdio was shut down.
[02:14:43] <Brekkjern> Sure
[02:15:22] <gwozniak> Oh, right, I think I tried rdio for a bit.  Wasn't all that impressed and moved on
[02:15:29] <manicennui> gwozniak: Frankly, the streaming services don't charge enough to pay artists well.
[02:16:02] <manicennui> But spotify does spend money on a lot of dumb shit like Joe Rogan.
[02:16:33] <manicennui> I don't know how much people expect to be paid out when they spend $10 per month for unlimited music.
[02:17:56] <gwozniak> I can't see that rate lasting
[02:20:21] <manicennui> It's also not just spotify that is the problem.
[02:20:33] <manicennui> A big chunk of what is paid out goes to other middlemen.
[02:20:59] <gwozniak> Streaming services are, overall, probably a good thing for the music industry.  But it will almost certainly end up looking like radio did
[02:21:15] <manicennui> I don't even think it matters whether they are good.
[02:21:21] <manicennui> There aren't other options.
[02:21:28] <manicennui> At least broadly.
[02:21:38] <gwozniak> Payola and other shady stuff all the time.  And artists getting fucked on revenue
[02:21:48] <manicennui> Bandcamp and such are great and all, but they are still tiny in the grand scheme of things.
[02:22:03] <manicennui> And most of the other options require the artist to do their own marketing.
[02:22:11] <gwozniak> I hope it sticks around, though
[02:22:37] <manicennui> If the streaming services didn't exist, there would probably just be far more piracy.
[02:22:44] <gwozniak> "Doing your own marketing" is why I didn't stay in the music industry. I'm terrible at it and knew it
[02:22:52] <Brekkjern> Sometimes ther are only bad options and you have to choose the least bad.
[02:22:56] <gwozniak> And I didn't want to get better at it
[02:23:37] <gwozniak> If online music can at least keep things like Bandcamp alive, that's better than it was before
[02:23:41] <manicennui> Creators have always been fucked and things are just going to get worse.
[02:24:16] <manicennui> gwozniak: I doubt that many musicians are able to make a living from Bandcamp.
[02:24:22] <Brekkjern> Everyone gets shafted as long as payment processing is involved...
[02:24:28] <manicennui> While it might pay better, it isn't a real option.
[02:24:49] <manicennui> Brekkjern: It's not even payment processing.
[02:24:49] <gwozniak> It's not about making a living on it, it's about another decent source of revenue
[02:24:57] <gwozniak> Like selling CDs at concerts
[02:25:24] <gwozniak> Artists have the unpleasant work of having to cobble together revenue from a lot of places
[02:25:31] <manicennui> An artist on spotify probably gives a cut to the label, a manager, and a distributor.
[02:25:34] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I know, I'm just saying that as long as payment processors are a thing you have to deal with, then it's only really viable for larger centralized distribution solutions, and that means they will shaft you too.
[02:25:58] <manicennui> Spotify isn't the only game in town, and the distributors take care of getting music to all of the various services.
[02:26:12] <Brekkjern> And a streaming service doesn't want to deal with every individual artist directly, so they will add middle men to do the deals, and those middle men will shaft the artists
[02:26:14] <Brekkjern> And so on
[02:26:39] <Brekkjern> If you could handly payment in a practical and direct way with the customers, then you wouldn't really need all the middle men
[02:26:50] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Sure you would.
[02:26:57] <manicennui> You are missing the most important part of what spotify does.
[02:27:02] <manicennui> Which is essentially marketing.
[02:27:13] <manicennui> Good luck getting your random website noticed.
[02:27:18] <Brekkjern> Not missing it. That's why I use Spotify.
[02:27:38] <manicennui> You could completely solve the payment processing problem and you'd have no real impact.
[02:27:54] <manicennui> Except in a very small number of cases where bands are able to effectively market themselves.
[02:28:03] <Brekkjern> Their Discover Weekly solution and song radio stations are why I use Spotify. If I just wanted to listen to some music I'd just get it downloaded from somewhere and listen to it on repeat.
[02:28:46] <Brekkjern> Lol. I just noticed I got dividends from my shares. All $0.53.
[02:30:15] <Brekkjern> This is obviously how you get rich.
[02:30:26] <manicennui> It is actually.
[02:30:35] <Brekkjern> Just gotta have more money so it's actually worth it...
[02:30:38] <manicennui> Obviously you have to contribute more over time.
[02:31:53] <manicennui> Do you have it setup to reinvest dividends?
[02:32:25] <Brekkjern> Nope
[02:33:29] <manicennui> You'll never be rich!
[02:34:07] <Brekkjern> I don't think this will be the deciding factor :P
[02:37:17] <manicennui> I've received about $185 in dividends in the last 30 days.
[02:38:53] <Brekkjern> I have most of my long-term savings in funds rather than individual shares.
[02:39:12] <manicennui> Funds still pay dividends.
[02:39:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but that is reinvested automagically
[02:39:27] <manicennui> None of my money is in individual stock.
[02:39:32] <manicennui> Nah.
[02:39:34] <manicennui> You can direct it.
[02:40:08] <Brekkjern> Probably if I use someone else for it.
[02:41:18] <manicennui> There are even funds that specifically seek to return high dividends.
[02:41:34] <manicennui> But a normal S&P 500 fund pays out every quarter.
[02:41:41] <Brekkjern> Sure, but those are not the ones I have invested in :P
[02:42:04] <Brekkjern> Also, gotta remember that I don't live in the US, so a lot of the regs are not the same
[02:42:24] <manicennui> Yeah.

[19:23:57] <Geekingfrog> Do you think when/if it dies, it'll go down steadily after a sharp drop, or is it going to be a complete crash in a very short amount of time?
[19:23:59] <companion_cube> the sad coin face
[19:24:16] <companion_cube> I hope it keeps going down steadily, Geekingfrog

[19:45:45] <gwozniak> My only concern about a crypto crash is that it will create another 2008 situation that will foster more awful financial ideas

[19:48:13] <bontaq> maybe a good time to buy if it dumps more, -8% over the week for the s&p 500 isn't really that much

[19:59:52] <buttsbot> We're migrating many of our servers from Linux to FreeBSD | Hacker News
[20:00:18] <gwozniak> Surely the most dignified conversation will result
[20:00:21] <drakonis> it always is.
[20:00:52] <indigo> manicennui: It's always the same arguments
[20:01:14] <indigo> > FreeBSD's network stack is (still) superior to Linux's - and, often, so is its performance.
[20:01:27] <indigo> Is there any evidence for this??? This keeps getting reiterated
[20:01:39] <imode> I'd like some evidence of that too.
[20:01:50] <drakonis> they always trot out the same arguments
[20:02:10] <imode> it seems like the first part is code/interface quality related and the second part is, well, perf related.
[20:02:20] <drakonis> "FreeBSD development is (still) driven by technical interests, not strictly commercial ones." ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[20:02:23] <drakonis> this is bullshit
[20:03:57] <manicennui> Into the early 2000s FreeBSD was way, way more stable.
[20:04:05] <manicennui> And handled load far better.
[20:04:15] <manicennui> But SMP tripped them up, and it no longer mattered.
[20:04:18] <drakonis> but it aint the early 2000s anymore
[20:04:35] <manicennui> But this person claims to run a lot of both, and still finds FreeBSD to be more stable.
[20:04:38] <drakonis> they fucked up so badly they lost a lot of people during the period
[20:04:40] <manicennui> I don't find that hard to believe really.
[20:04:48] <manicennui> FreeBSD doesn't make big changes very frequently.
[20:05:07] <manicennui> By stability, I don't mean uptime (too much uptime means too few kernel security updates, which is wrong). I mean that things work as they should, that they don't "break" from one update to the next, and that you don't have to revise everything because of a missing or modified basic command.
[20:05:34] <manicennui> drakonis: They didn't fuck up. They didn't have the resources that the Linux people did.
[20:06:01] <manicennui> Removing the global kernel lock wasn't a small task.
[20:06:19] <drakonis> they had a big internal conflict that resulted in the creation of dragonflybsd
[20:06:43] <manicennui> No they didn't.
[20:06:56] <manicennui> Stop trying to make everything seem so dramatic.
[20:07:01] <drakonis> aight then
[20:07:17] <manicennui> One person wanted to explore some different options.
[20:07:26] <manicennui> A lot of dragonflybsd work went back into freebsd.
[20:08:20] <manicennui> It's not as though he was the sole person working on smp.
[20:10:25] <imode> yaaaaay I have a no-show.
[20:10:31] <imode> means I can C O D E .

[20:11:58] <buttsbot> Facebook Seeks Devs To Make Linux Network Stack As Good As FreeBSD's - Slashdot
[20:13:27] <indigo> Lol, some job posting from 2014 is still being touted as evidence that the FreeBSD stack is better than Linux's
[20:14:22] <manicennui> I wouldn't doubt that it is true though.
[20:14:22] <Church> indigo: There's a surprising amount in upstate NY
[20:14:38] <manicennui> The thing is, Linux often feels a bit like the JS ecosystem where shit is constantly changing for no good reason.
[20:14:59] <manicennui> FreeBSD is like PostgreSQL.
[20:15:01] <indigo> manicennui: I think "better" is too general
[20:15:14] <imode> yeah, define "better".
[20:15:15] <indigo> Better at what, specifically
[20:15:17] <manicennui> Very slow change and very cautious about new functionality.
[20:17:19] <gerikson> I remember Dvorak slamming lulnix ca 2000 by  citing big IRC networks using FreeBSD
[20:17:29] <drakonis> it wasnt always like that
[20:18:56] <indigo> Is it time to migrate libera to FreeBSD? Keep the dream alive?
[20:21:37] <bkero> FreeBSD is like PostgreSQL 6.0.
[20:21:40] <manicennui> gerikson: Around 2000 the majority of the top sites did run FreeBSD because it handled load so much better.
[20:21:57] <manicennui> I knew people who setup porn servers around that time.
[20:23:33] <indigo> That makes sense; FreeBSD handles loads way better ;)
[20:24:46] <drakonis> that's an oddly specific thing lol
[20:24:58] <manicennui> Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. all ran FreeBSD.
[20:25:06] <drakonis> ran, yes.
[20:25:33] <bkero> uhhhh
[20:25:38] <bkero> Yahoo ran Y!BSD
[20:26:44] <drakonis> gotta love how commited they are to bringing up jails every time containers come up
[20:27:00] <imode> I don't even know how to set up a fucking jail.
[20:27:17] <manicennui> imode: First you bribe state politicians...
[20:27:27] <imode> lmfao
[20:28:34] <gwozniak> I setup a jail in FreeBSD once.  It wasn't very hard.
[20:28:53] <gwozniak> But, it wasn't as easy as Docker
[20:29:27] * manicennui used a jail-based hosting provider back in the day.
[20:29:40] <Brekkjern> Eh. FreeBSD doesn't have systemd, so it's worse.
[20:29:50] <manicennui> http://johncompanies.com/
[20:29:51] <buttsbot> JohnCompanies / Professional VPS and Dedicated Server Hosting and Backup Services
[20:30:03] * manicennui sicks the anti-systemd people on Brekkjern 
[20:30:08] <gwozniak> I didn't deal with network stuff much, so I can't say whether the jail was better than Docker that way
[20:31:46] <manicennui> At the time I used jails, docker didn't exist.
[20:32:08] <manicennui> jails is more like an advanced chroot.
[20:32:37] <manicennui> At least it was. I haven't looked at it in a very long time.
[20:39:00] <drakonis> its a bad thread...
[20:39:33] <drakonis> also there's a thread that dares not treat nixos like the ultimate distribution
[20:39:44] <drakonis> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30057287
[20:39:45] <buttsbot> The Curse of NixOS | Hacker News
[20:40:32] <manicennui> Someone mentions a reason to use FreeBSD that is perhaps even better: moving absolutely everything to one OS is probably not the best idea.
[20:41:27] <indigo> Hm, why not?
[20:50:29] <manicennui> Why not put all of our eggs in one basket?
[20:52:20] <imode> jesus AMZN dropped 23% since I sold..
[20:56:15] <ngoldbaum> as per normal i bought a bunch of s&p 500 etfs right before a major correction :/
[20:56:50] <manicennui> Buy more now to decrease your overall cost!
[20:57:16] <Geekingfrog> etfs ?
[20:58:12] <manicennui> Funds that trade like stocks.
[21:06:46] <companion_cube> manicennui: you buying ETFs right now? :)
[21:07:04] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: I put some limit orders and it's like "oh, another one just passed"
[21:07:05] <manicennui> I'm not doing anything right now.
[21:07:06] <companion_cube> :DDD
[21:07:37] <manicennui> I need to figure out what I want to do with my housing situation this year.
[21:07:49] <manicennui> Don't want more money tied up in the market right now.
[21:16:27] <Church> Hmm do I buy some ETFS or something...
[21:16:40] <Church> Still know jack about investing.
[21:16:41] <manicennui> Maybe.
[21:17:17] <manicennui> You could do worse than putting some money in S&P ETFs every once in a while and just leaving it for years.
[21:17:52] * manicennui is back to doubting whether he wants to deal with snow anymore.
[21:17:57] <Church> Nod, nod. Even the how of that evades me heh. Do I need like a brokerage account or something somewhere?
[21:19:36] <companion_cube> I've opened a vanguard account after talking with manicennui
[21:19:47] <manicennui> Church: Yeah.

[21:22:18] <ngoldbaum> out worse because of fees
[21:22:57] <ngoldbaum> you do need to stay in the market over the long term to realize that
[21:23:16] <Church> Yeah that I'm aware of. Been working on liquid assets and debt destruction the last few years
[21:23:26] <ngoldbaum> oh yeah pay off debt first

[21:34:09] <imode> well, what'd you buy like a month ago. :P
[21:34:22] <ngoldbaum> oh sorry i misread what as why
[21:34:29] <ngoldbaum> i just buy VOO typically
[21:34:49] <imode> figured.
[21:34:59] <imode> seems to be the one to sink your money into.
[21:35:42] <companion_cube> same, with a bit of BND
[21:35:46] <manicennui> Buying now would be good while it is down, but generally you should have some kind of plan and stick to it so you aren't tempted to try to be clever.
[21:36:17] <ngoldbaum> yeah and try not to be in a position where you’re sitting on a bunch of cash waiting for a market dip that might never come
[21:36:22] <manicennui> With most places getting rid of commissions, you can throw some in every paycheck.
[21:37:12] <companion_cube> I've just been regularly placing limit orders a bit below market, but otherwise, yeah, buy regularly I guess
[21:38:09] <imode> I'll buy when things start recovering.
[21:38:18] <imode> very heavy drop.
[21:38:26] <ngoldbaum> the problem with putting my bike trainer in the basement is it’s coooooold down here in the winter
[21:42:24] <Brekkjern> Why can't just people write the "why" as a comment?
[21:43:08] <Brekkjern> They take some data from some place, and then subtract a number from each element in the list. The number is obviously an epoch, but why is that number chosen?
[21:44:05] <manicennui> Generally pretty clear if you use good variable and method/function names as well.
[21:44:19] <Brekkjern> df["waypoints"].apply(lambda f: [item["timestamp"] - 1554772579000 for item in f])
[21:44:23] <Brekkjern> Oh, yes. Excellent.
[21:44:50] <manicennui> That is what we'd refer to as a magic number, and should be replaced with a constant probably.
[21:45:34] <Brekkjern> Absolutely, but this is taken from some documentation...
[21:45:54] <manicennui> I don't know WTF that would even be.
[21:45:57] <manicennui> It is far too large.
[21:46:19] <manicennui> Unless it is milliseconds.
[21:46:30] <Brekkjern> Likely
[21:46:46] <Brekkjern> This is the source data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visgl/deck.gl-data/master/website/sf.trips.json
[21:46:57] <Brekkjern> But it isn't really explained there either
[21:51:15] <gerikson> if you divide it by 1,000 it's Tue Apr 09 2019 01:16:19 GMT+0000
[21:59:30] <Brekkjern> Sounds about right
[22:09:27] <Geekingfrog> birthdate of the daughter of the CEO ?
[22:11:11] <Brekkjern> More likely it is the earliest timestamp in the dataset
[22:11:18] <Brekkjern> So the timestamp becomes relative

[22:49:01] <imode> even the PNW?
[22:49:05] <imode> it's pretty wet here.

[22:49:18] <imode> fair.
[22:49:35] <manicennui> It's weird to me that everyone talks about the rain in the PNW.
[22:49:42] <manicennui> That all happens in the winter when it is snowing here.

[22:50:45] <manicennui> Summers are super dry, and seem to be getting drier. Plus you have everyone moving there putting stress on the water supply, especially in California.
[22:50:57] <imode> yeah.. you make a good point there.
[22:51:02] <imode> it was dangerously dry here.
[22:51:16] <imode> I may just move back east, that seems like a more stable climate.
[22:51:30] <manicennui> Great Lakes region seems like one of the most stable.
