[03:24:25] <JollyRgrs> and selinux is kind of like a firewall, but for applications instead of ports

[08:04:09] <sd> 08<a‚Äãwlnx> Wireguard is simplar and faster. OpenVPN is more mature and has a lot more features.
[08:04:26] <JollyRgrs> simpler? yes and no
[08:04:44] <JollyRgrs> wireguard is not as easy to get others to use, imo
[08:05:05] <JollyRgrs> ovpn you can just give thema config file
[08:06:48] <xe0n> guess the answer is how do both solutions fit into your existing environment and what would work best for what you're trying to acheive, which solution can you manage, make it seamless for users, etc etc
[08:07:07] <sd> 08<a‚Äãwlnx> I guess what I mean is it's a smaller code base. It does 1 thing and does it super well, but you hurt on the management /useablity of it
[08:07:43] <JollyRgrs> yeah... that's a better way to say that
[08:08:12] <JollyRgrs> i use wireguard over ovpn on my android phone (for connecting back home) b/c with wireguard, I my home DNS works
[08:08:27] <JollyRgrs> so I can use the same server settings home or out in the world
[08:08:36] <JollyRgrs> ovpn, i can set the DNS, but android doesn't care
[08:09:51] <catbeard> are you forcing dns resolution client binding through the ovpn link?
[08:10:57] <catbeard> e.g. the srcip for the dns request uses the vpn ip and queries the ovpn dhcp provided resolvers
[08:11:06] <xe0n> sounds like a non-issue since he aint using it lol!

[11:24:26] <DrZak> so i can tell this highschooler - ok, you will get this reply from exchange, there you will get the new URL and then you should go to the new URL

[19:14:24] <Hunterkll> get the yubikey issued as a smartcard from your internal CA instead of using FIDO login if you want to be properly extra secure 
[19:14:34] <Hunterkll> but hello for business is a huge ordeal even if you do it onprem 
[19:15:03] <sd_> 11<H‚Äãotmess> probably just gonna use fido for my personal use
[19:15:30] <sd_> 11<H‚Äãotmess> i got mfa setup on my admin accounts just i wanna use passwordless login for the diff machines i have ot use in the user enviroment
[19:15:36] <Hunterkll> fido's kind of unusual in the windows chain for auth, but smart card's the only 'true' non-bypassable MFA 
[19:15:43] <Hunterkll> which hello for business basically uses the TPM as an embedded smartcard
[19:15:59] <Hunterkll> i think fido has to be paired per-machine
[19:16:11] <Hunterkll> unless you're using AAD accounts? 
[19:16:17] <Hunterkll> not sure about that scenario 
[19:16:32] <Hunterkll> issued as a smartcard will "just work" o n any domain joined machine environment wide without issue
[19:17:51] <sd_> 11<H‚Äãotmess> In this case it's edu so all hybrid with write back
[19:18:21] <Hunterkll> yea but are you using AD credentials to log into the machine, or AAD accounts
[19:18:30] <Hunterkll> yes, the AAD account exists and it's hybrid joined
[19:18:35] <Hunterkll> but you gotta figure out which one you're actually using
[19:19:07] <Hunterkll> normal use case in those scenarios is AD accounts, and AAD accounts/hybrid SSO for online stuff, and AAD accounts for home usage machines that sign into school stuff (but not used as the login account)
[19:20:03] <sd_> 11<H‚Äãotmess> The difference is byod Vs fully managed
[19:20:23] <sd_> 11<H‚Äãotmess> The machines I am gonna use it on are fully enrolled
[19:20:32] <Hunterkll> fully managed would probably be AD accounts then

[19:22:52] <Hunterkll> it's all the same exact management interfaces
[19:23:20] <Hunterkll> you can do the AD key storage shit and GPO enforcement well enough, but MBAM/SCCM give you far more options and shit like a helpdesk key retreival interface, etc

[22:36:33] <sd_> 07<I‚Äãannelli> Our windows team is sending notifications to employees' devices that say "your PC is going to restart for updates in 2 minutes"

[22:36:33] <sd_> 07<I‚Äãannelli> There is no way to cancel or delay this. It just happens. It's also an extremely small and quick dialog box that disappears quickly.

[22:37:21] <sd_> 07<I‚Äãannelli> I honestly don't know.
[22:37:27] <sintax> if any they should be forcing the restart after ours or weekends
[22:37:27] <Activ8> lannelli they need to change the gpo for the windows updates not to update during business hours

[23:19:55] <Hunterkll> you ain't stackin 20 apps into one server that all need similar ports and/or functions to operate
[23:19:56] <Hunterkll> lol

[23:20:20] <shakygator> just change the ports jeez Hunterkll 
[23:20:24] <Hunterkll> that's like using a shared SQL server for SCCM as well, when the SCCM servers need local admin on the SQL servers and SA rights
[23:20:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:20:37] <Activ8> yeh just like sccm ha
[23:20:53] <Hunterkll> when you say app server i pictured you installing a bunch of random shit on one OS instance

[23:52:44] <Hunterkll> and several governments across the world would like to know your location
[23:52:51] <Hunterkll> actually all of them would
[23:53:20] *** Quits: Spydar007 (~spydar007@user/spydar007) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[23:53:57] <Hunterkll> because you probably now have either a specific firmware rev exploit for a single TPM vendor/implementation (not so bad) or a generic way to break smartcards (would be fucking catastrophic) 
[23:54:11] *** Joins: Spydar007 (~spydar007@user/spydar007)
[23:54:40] <Hunterkll> radix0: as to the telemetry, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/diagnostic-data-viewer-overview
[23:55:19] <radix0> I think you've missed my point. It's a lack of trust of MS. Sure they might give you a tool, but how can I trust the tool?
[23:55:36] <Hunterkll> because you can see what the tool's accessing/where .....
[23:55:49] <radix0> How do you know that? Who audits the auditor?
[23:55:54] <Hunterkll> tbh my company put this subject to rest in 2015 when it was a real hot topic 
[23:56:08] <cryptic1> This again...
[23:56:14] <cryptic1> Why did I look in here
[23:56:38] <Hunterkll> given what we work with, they had a field day tearing it apart/MITM'ing it/inspecting services/tearing it apart/etc 
[23:56:57] <sd_> 06<b‚Äãloody> Hey hunterkill
[23:57:11] <sd_> 06<b‚Äãloody> What kind of hw have you got in your homelab
[23:57:26] <cryptic1> Its more of a lair than a lab
[23:57:31] <Hunterkll> @bloody effectively an X9 supermicro and two disk shelves, the rest is all various specific purpose/non-x86/etc stuff
[23:57:43] <sd_> 12<f‚Äãelda> Wassup cryptic1
[23:57:56] <sd_> 06<b‚Äãloody> Hi cryptic :)
[23:58:00] <cryptic1> @felda hey bro :)
[23:58:06] <cryptic1> @bloody :D
[23:58:08] <sd_> 06<b‚Äãloody> Thanks hunter
[23:58:16] <sd_> 12<f‚Äãelda> How are our cherished young boys Gibby and ravioli?
[23:58:28] <cryptic1> ravi I rarely see
[23:58:29] <gibby> <3 felda
[23:58:37] <cryptic1> gibby is always lurking
[23:58:38] <Hunterkll> @bloody I mean, it's a filled 42U rack, but that's what I run my 24/7 shit on that I actually use for non-labby things
[23:58:42] <sd_> 12<f‚Äãelda> Ayyy
[23:58:44] <gibby> gluggla glugga
[23:59:03] <gibby> ravi jumps in irc on occasion. I think he's still alive :) 
[23:59:08] <Hunterkll> radix0: i mean, the long and short of it is, you can watch the damn telemetry service executible, see what it reads, and trace from there 
[23:59:42] *** Joins: Nothing4You (N4Y@nothing4you.w.tf-w.tf)
[23:59:45] <Hunterkll> if the documentation and tools were hiding shit, that'd be a *major* scandal 
[23:59:52] <radix0> Sure, but are you going to re-audit what it does after every system update?
[23:59:57] <sd_> 06<b‚Äãloody> I was thinking of picking up a r720
