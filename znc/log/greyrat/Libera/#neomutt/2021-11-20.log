[18:27:16] <ckardaris> how do we use struct ListHead? It seems that it is defined in muttlib.h, but it has no body there. I am going crazy with all these #define in queue.h
[18:27:58] <flatcap> hi ckardaris 
[18:28:06] <ckardaris> hello flatcap
[18:28:59] <flatcap> (it's 3rd-party source, widely used in the linux and bsd worlds)
[18:29:15] <flatcap> struct ListHead my_list = STAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER(my_list);
[18:30:52] <ckardaris> ok, I am trying to create a struct of this ListHeads and I cannot do it. In main.c there is a struct ListHead attach = STAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER(attach) segment. How would I go about adding such a field in a struct?
[18:30:54] <flatcap> STAILQ_INSERT_TAIL(&my_list, str, entries); // 'entries' is a fixed thing, tied to the definition of the list
[18:32:24] <ckardaris> So I guess I cannot define struct ListHead something and then make the init later?
[18:33:51] <ckardaris> Or do I have to create the list in another way in that case?
[18:34:05] <flatcap> I'm not sure if we alloc any ListHeads dynamically
[18:34:06] * flatcap looks ...
[18:35:25] <flatcap> nope
[18:35:39] <ckardaris> Basically I am trying to recreate all the lists for the IPC data that I am receiving. So I need to have them in a struct in order to be better organized
[18:35:53] <flatcap> they're always part a local var, or part of a bigger struct
[18:35:55] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[18:36:52] <flatcap> what's the scope of the list?  global?
[18:37:19] <ckardaris> With how I have understood the code so far it has to be
[18:37:39] <flatcap> yeah :-)
[18:37:44] <ckardaris> I have created a socket_struct and inside I save all my data to use in other parts of the code
[18:37:58] * flatcap is trying to eliminate globals, but it's un uphill struggle
[18:39:06] <ckardaris> It's a huge endeavor to eliminate them
[18:39:49] <flatcap> yeah.  we've made a lot of good progress
[18:40:26] <ckardaris> The code is too nested from what I have understood
[18:41:03] <ckardaris> Also, there is a lot of duplication that does not help. index, pager, etc. Correct me if I am wrong
[18:41:46] <flatcap> yeah, I'm closer to eliminating the dupes of `op_function_XYZ()`
[18:42:07] <ckardaris> what branch is this work happening on?
[18:42:57] <flatcap> I don't have much work towards _that_ goal that isn't already merged
[18:43:44] <ckardaris> Ah ok. Cool then
[18:44:16] <flatcap> [flatcap/colour] is my current focus -- a step towards separating calculation from display in the page
[18:44:39] <flatcap> that'll help my longer-term goal of splitting the index and pager
[18:44:52] <flatcap> _then_ I can de-dupe the functions :-)
[18:45:55] <ckardaris> I wish you luck :)
[18:46:05] <flatcap> thanks
[18:46:36] <flatcap> there's a quotation: ... the most likely way to reach a goal is to be aiming not at that goal itself but at some more ambitious goal beyond it
[18:47:29] <wux> #Hi, I'm trying to organize my emails. So far, I created mailboxes(folders) from command line and moved mails to mailboxes (I use Maildir/POP3). Is there a way to do that directly in neomutt?
[18:49:24] <flatcap> hi wux
[18:50:28] <flatcap> yes.  I'd start with a bit of config to tell neomutt about your local mailboxes
[18:50:45] <flatcap> set folder = "~/mail"
[18:50:57] <flatcap> mailboxes +folder1
[18:51:00] <flatcap> mailboxes +folder2
[18:51:03] <flatcap> ...
[18:52:06] <flatcap> and probably "set sidebar_visible = yes"
[18:52:44] <wux> Hi flatcap, that's what I have at the moment. I was wondering if there is a command to create a new folder/mailbox in neomutt.
[18:53:04] <wux> Thanks for the quick response :-)
[18:53:30] <flatcap> good.  you don't need to (er, I think :-)  if you have config "set mbox_type = maildir"
[18:54:00] <flatcap> then when you try to save to a non-existent mailbox, it'll get created
[18:54:49] <flatcap> tag lots, then ';s'  <tag-prefix><save-message>  and enter a path   ~/mail/new-folder
[18:58:22] <wux> Thanks. I'm going to try right away. BRB.
[18:58:32] <flatcap> ah.  it'll create the mailbox, but not the tree to get there, so ~/new/new2/mailbox won't work
[19:11:10] <flatcap> ckardaris: where were we?  if the ListHead is in a dynamically created struct, then you'll want STAILQ_INIT(&ptr->list);
[19:22:59] <ckardaris> I did sth = (struct ListHead)STAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER(sth) and it seems to compile. I haven't checked if it works though yet
[19:23:28] <ckardaris> I am not sure if it is correct
[19:24:36] <flatcap> I think it's ok.  I don't think you need the (cast) though
[19:25:21] <ckardaris> It was throwing compiler errors. expected expression before '{' token
[19:25:47] <flatcap> oh
[19:25:55] <ckardaris> because the definition was happening in another place
[19:26:17] <ckardaris> SO pointed me to casting
[19:26:32] <flatcap> oh, I see.  the macro expands to { x, y, z }
[19:26:56] <ckardaris> Yes and I needed to assign the whole struct at once
[19:27:26] <ckardaris> I am not that proficient with C to know these things. Haha
[19:27:28] *** Joins: Phandal (~Phandal@user/phandal)
[19:27:32] <ckardaris> I am learning though
[19:28:21] <flatcap> hmm... if you have   "struct ListHead lh;"  then you've got a block of uninitialised memory on the stack
[19:29:28] <flatcap> when you,  "lh = STAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER(lh)"  you're doing an object assignment.  the compiler will memcpy the "{ x, y, z }" in the macro into your var

[19:31:59] <ckardaris> so basically at definition time I can do it without casting, but if I want it later I need to inform the compiler that "you know, the data I am assigning is of that type". Is that correct?
[19:32:46] <flatcap> yes
[19:34:39] <flatcap> why the delay in initialising the var?
[19:55:47] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:56:30] <Phandal> is it worth using mutt before neomutt or should I just go for neomutt right away?
[19:58:07] <flatcap> hehe, are you really expecting an unbiased answer in #neomutt :-)
[19:58:35] <Phandal> ok but like what is the difference?
[19:59:28] <flatcap> mutt is old, stable and resistant to change
[19:59:58] <flatcap> neomutt has more features (and we're trying to clean up the code to make it easier to add more)
[20:00:32] <flatcap> a popular feature is Notmuch integration (for users with local maildirs)
[20:00:41] <Phandal> flatcap: How does it handle html emails?
[20:01:05] <flatcap> both mutt and neomutt use mailcap entries to decide...
[20:01:23] <flatcap> either render the email into text (using elinks, w3m etc)
[20:01:31] <flatcap> or push the email out to a browser
[20:02:39] <Phandal> hmm I think I'll give it a go.
[20:03:12] <flatcap> great.  Welcome :-)
[20:35:07] <ckardaris> sorry for the delay flatcap, I am just defining a struct to group my lists. Definition in a header and then init in the .c file
[20:43:45] <wux> Back. I got caught up. It works perfectly for what I need. Thanks flatcap.
