[00:57:39] <James0r> so would it be safe to say that a fast-forward occurs when only additive changes are made? what about when code is removed, but not in conflict?
[00:58:24] <ikke> It has nothing to do with the type of changes
[00:58:26] <imMute> James0r: it's not really about additive changes, it's about if the branches have diverged, ie both branches have commits.

[01:07:10] <James0r> ahh okay. thx
[01:09:35] <James0r> okay one more thing i'm stuck on, i guess this is probably by design, but branches only exist where you explitly create and push them right? is that so if someone wants to go crazy with branching off 20 times locally and then merge them all back together into some branch we're committing to, we dont have to see that persons branch mess?
[01:10:32] <ikke> If they create a lot of criss-cross non-ff merges, you will see it when they push the final branch
[01:10:52] <imMute> James0r: yes, branches are local to a repo.  your master is a separate master than the server's and separate from your coworker's master.
[01:11:20] <imMute> ikke's explanation is better though.

[01:14:05] <nedbat> James0r: branches only exist where you push them because git is fundamentally decentralized: each repo is its own snapshot of the world.  Two repos can have different ideas of where "main" is, for example, until one pushes to the other.

[01:26:32] <James0r> so if i'm using git history extension in vs code, for example, it isn't reliably showing me the history of all branches, it's just showing branches that my repo is aware of

[01:41:34] <mspe> it's always a good idea to regularly rebase your current feature branch onto the common main/dev branch, so that's you often resolve tiny problems if some happen, instead of having a big brainstorm when you finish your feature

[01:47:18] <mspe> yeah but those times are rather rare, and if it happens you can still just abort the rebase attempt and merge later

[09:26:37] <gitinfo> Use a double-dash(--) to separate refs or arguments from file paths. This is especially useful when dealing with ambiguous names. Ex: `git checkout origin -- master` will check out the file "master" from branch "origin"

I have worked on and off on this branch for weeks so I can not remerber all the commands I used. But, I did `git rebase main` and know When I look at the PR feat->main, it has a lot of commits that are not mine that are supposed to be merged.
[12:09:54] <trebuh> How can I re-establish the correct state of my branch, ie have a feat branch with only my commits and rebased on the most recent version of origin/main?

[23:22:43] <j416> apply the patch, fix it later
[23:23:29] <j416> (is what I'd do, fwiw)
[23:23:55] <bremner> yeah, editing patches is best avoided if possible
[23:24:00] <bremner> just amend the commit

[23:26:58] <humky> I copied it from the web, tabs and spaces are all messed up, and I don't know it's just a mess, can't stop this warning. This issue is like mine: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18142870/git-error-fatal-corrupt-patch-at-line-36
[23:27:36] <sh4> it's just a warning, ignore it
[23:28:12] <humky> ok :/
[23:29:07] <sh4> as was mentioned earlier, you can correct the whitespaces manually afterwards in a new commit or by amending (if there's really something messed up)
