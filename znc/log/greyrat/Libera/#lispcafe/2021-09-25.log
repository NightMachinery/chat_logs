[01:16:28] <gilberth> Hmm, the CADR is not year 2000 ready. When I enter the date as 24/9/2021 it asks me whether the date "twenty-fourth of September, 19121" would be correct and the wholine then says "09/24/<1"
[01:16:59] <hayley> gilberth: https://twitter.com/stylewarning/status/1441420975044640769?s=20
[01:19:58] <gilberth> ?
[01:20:11] <gilberth> Does it run on the CADR yet?
[01:20:46] <hayley> Nope.
[01:20:56] <hayley> But stylewarning wants to use it already.
[01:21:28] <hayley> And somehow I suspect clex2 would fit better, yknow?
[01:21:29] <gilberth> I believe it's time then that I find the POSIX RE test suite.
[01:21:50] <gilberth> What does stylewarning want to do?
[01:22:46] <hayley> He wants to use my regex engine as a lexer for his compiler. Which is weird because I thought his compiler mostly took time doing not-lexing things.
[01:23:21] <gilberth> Yes, this is ironic, as I have the lexer and you have the greper.
[01:24:30] <hayley> Also, w.r.t compilation at runtime, what do you think of using a chain of closures and then only compiling a TAGBODY when it's hot enough?
[01:24:50] <gilberth> Milady, you just want to press me to release.
[01:25:14] <gilberth> hayley: You decide, I don't care too much for online use.
[01:27:04] <hayley> I dunno though.
[01:27:41] <gilberth> I would just compile every time. When you grep just a few thousand lines the response is prompt enough for interactive use and then when you grep a whole disk array, you win. Would someone be so bold and construct new REs at runtime all the time, I'll shrug.
[01:28:38] <gilberth> Provided that we keep a cache just in case the regex is not constant at compile time.
[01:29:15] <hayley> Yes, I've always cached.
[01:29:51] * hayley has to describe why she thinks cooperative scheduling with one scheduler is no concurrency at all.
[01:30:20] <gilberth> It still is sort of.
[01:30:43] <hayley> The definition from Lamport's famous paper is "Two distinct events a and b are said to be concurrent if a doesn't happen before b and b doesn't happen before a." 
[01:32:27] <gilberth> hayley: I won't bother with closures. If I really would wish for a quick start, I would just construct the DFA, which isn't too slow and then interpret it for the first /n/ chars and then just compile it in one go. Don't make things too complicated. However, you could win when you construct the DFA on the fly as you derive.
[01:33:01] <gilberth> hayley: Whether two events happen with no particular order is a question of the perspective.
[01:33:11] <hayley> Now, there are two possibilities. Either a and b are separated by YIELD, or they are not. If they are not separated, evidently they run sequentially, and your language spec will tell you how. If they are, then I suppose the ordering is totally arbitrary, but portable programs require that a and b aren't run concurrently.
[01:33:47] <gilberth> HW interrupts?
[01:34:20] <hayley> OR another proof: Assume our program consists of statements including YIELD. We could translate a program in this scheme to a concurrent system by taking a global lock between YIELDs.
[01:34:30] <hayley> And this is no concurrency at all, because you linearize when grabbing the lock.
[01:35:17] <gilberth> Sorry, you are talking about cooperative multithreading. I was reading "single CPU".
[01:35:24] <moon-child> I don't buy this proof.  if A and B are unsequenced, then the program can not semantically depend on any particular sequencing of them.  So we can linearize them however we wish
[01:35:33] <hayley> Cooperative multithreading on a single CPU, yes.
[01:36:00] <gilberth> What is cooperative multithreading on a multiprocessor?
[01:36:01] <hayley> I guess, but it requires that A and B don't really run concurrently and I don't like that.
[01:36:17] * hayley shrugs
[01:37:30] <gilberth> hayley: I need to find something edible. We talk later.
[01:37:51] <White_Flame> I guess cooperative multithreading on a multiprocessor would ensure that no process would ever simultaneously run 2 threads concurrently
[01:38:05] <White_Flame> hmm, or maybe not
[01:38:20] <White_Flame> cooperative simply means that a thread chooses to yield, and is not externally preempted
[01:38:43] <White_Flame> it probably technically doesn't mean that it has exclusive access to the process footprint
[01:39:54] <gilberth> Well even on a single CPU cooperative multithreading system you usually still have interrupts, so again this is a question of the perspective.
[01:40:33] <Alfr> gilberth, weren't you going to find something edible? ;)
[01:40:58] <gilberth> Alfr: Yeah, ok, ok, I'll shut up.
[01:41:57] <Alfr> gilberth, that was only a reminder. Nothing else to it.

[01:46:34] <hayley> https://old.reddit.com/r/LispMemes/comments/podj2c/lisp_bottles/he4v4s5/?context=3 <- Well, that's a lie.

[01:48:45] <hayley> I mean I only made the piss bottle joke cause that article said Rust used Amazon (the company) principles somehow, way to spook urself
[01:55:58] <hayley> w.r.t concurrency and cooperative multithreading: okay, it is concurrent. But we have really coarse-grained locking and no control over it.
[02:10:25] <Gnuxie> Hoe does locking work with coop mutothreading on multiple processes 
[02:11:15] <Gnuxie> Surely all locking had to be through scheduler and expensive af 
[02:11:38] <hayley> Dunno, I'm only saying that it's equivalent to very coarse (alternately, very coarse, depending on what you want to do) locking.
[02:11:57] <Gnuxie> Idk what coarse locking means 
[02:12:10] <Gnuxie> I only know sand is coarse apparently 
[02:12:13] <hayley> Coarse locking does more stuff while locked, fine locking does less stuff.
[02:12:34] <hayley> The former is easier to write, but often slower. 
[02:12:50] <Gnuxie> Hmm what does the stuff? The act of locking? 
[02:13:26] <Gnuxie> Thonk 
[02:13:45] <Gnuxie> Aren't murexes already mediated by OS scheduler 
[02:14:15] <hayley> Yes.
[02:14:39] <hayley> The more locking, the less stuff runs concurrently, which is a big no-no with lots of cores.
[02:15:17] <Gnuxie> Well in that case how is coop mutex any worse than os mutex 
[02:15:29] <Gnuxie> Ofc you never really want to use that shit anyways 
[02:17:01] <Gnuxie> Other than the obvious having to reimplement mutexes (dunno how they do that for OS) or have double overhead 
[02:17:20] <hayley> It's worse because you can't opt out of it. The locking is entirely implicit.
[02:17:38] <hayley> And there's no lock, there's just nothing ever running concurrently.
[02:18:01] <Gnuxie> That's not true 
[02:18:07] <hayley> The only lock is a metaphor I use to describe how this shit is slow.
[02:19:14] <Gnuxie> You can have only explicit yield continuations scheduled onto many threads

[13:52:05] <Alfr> gilberth, maybe those too, I don't know. I meant the semiconductor kind.
[13:52:43] <gilberth> selwyn: All kinds of building got short and expensive a few month ago. This is why our stock is more than full. My wife doesn't know anymore where to put the stuff.
[13:53:06] <selwyn> um
[13:53:12] <gilberth> Alfr: Ah yes. But that is a world-wide issue.
[13:53:21] <selwyn> remind me what kind of stock?
[13:54:11] <Alfr> gilberth, hey! Don't blame me, that's what selwyn asked. :p
[13:54:50] <gilberth> Stock? I mean storage. We stocked up on building materials like cooper cables and things a few month ago as prices raised and supply got short. So that we still can deliver.
[13:55:21] <selwyn> oh right
[13:56:04] <gilberth> And solar panels. People buy those like crazy.
[13:56:06] <hayley> (the-cost-of-nothing:bench (one-more-re-nightmare:all-matches "abc" "abcde") :timeout 5) ⇒ 94.82 nanoseconds
[13:56:09] <hayley> Really, that much overhead?
[13:58:44] <hayley> Well, it's still 5× faster than CL-PPCRE™.
[13:59:04] * dave0 counts up to 94 nanoseconds ... 1
[13:59:49] <gilberth> ... 95. Missed. :(
[14:01:20] <hayley> We spend as much time in the DFA as in %MAKE-ARRAY apparently.
[14:01:41] <gilberth> You cons an array?
[14:02:23] <hayley> My calling convention currently puts the resulting tags in an vectors, and that is copied into a list of vectors.
[14:02:45] <hayley> *in a vector
[14:02:53] <gilberth> Copying the somewhat awkward cl-ppcre API?
[14:03:21] <dave0> how long does it take for sound to get to your ears, so like you can tell the direction it's coming from?
[14:03:25] <hayley> CL-PPCRE:ALL-MATCHES gives you a list with the start and end "flattened" in, and no submatches.
[14:03:59] <dave0> like you know the sound comes from the left because there is xxx somethingseconds delay from your left ear to your right ear ?
[14:04:08] <dave0> *how do you know
[14:04:28] <dave0> can humans even percieve things that take less than a millisecond?
[14:04:38] <dave0> cos a nanosecond is just crazytalk
[14:04:56] <hayley> (values (cl-ppcre:all-matches "abc(d)" "abcdeabc") (one-more-re-nightmare:all-matches "abc«d»" "abcdeabc")) ⇒ (0 4), (#(0 4 3 4))
[14:05:04] <hayley> I am biased but I like the latter more.
[14:05:07] <gilberth> dave0: Sound travels at like 300m/s. For 3d hearing it's phase shift. And a curious thing happens: Humans can't tell the direction of a pure sine wave.
[14:05:57] <gilberth> Hence the beep-beep-beep vehicles make when driving backwards is useless.
[14:06:04] <selwyn> people can see single photons
[14:06:13] <selwyn> though somewhat unreliably
[14:06:35] <gilberth> selwyn: Indeed. We did that at school.
[14:08:50] <selwyn> the detection of a single photon is surely a very rapid event
[14:09:13] <gilberth> dave0: Well, For sound it's like one feet per millisecond. For light it's one feet per nanosecond. Easy to remember.
[14:10:10] <gilberth> selwyn: Isn't some cascade happening in the eye? I don't remember, school is too long ago.
[14:10:17] <dave0> oh okay so we can hear things that quick
[14:10:47] <dave0> but a millisecond is still fast
[14:10:58] <selwyn> a cascade? yeah not sure. that sounds like a photodetector
[14:11:01] <gilberth> dave0: The brain somehow could make out the phase shift. This doesn't mean that this is actually processed that quick.
[14:11:35] <gilberth> selwyn: This is what I remember. I might be wrong.
[14:12:20] <gilberth> And a millisecond is a long time. :)
[14:13:03] <dave0> maybe if you're being tortured
[14:13:28] <gilberth> On that note. It's kind of depressing that the 'F series in 74xx still is the fasted with around 10ns propagation delay, which isn't fast.
[14:14:04] <gilberth> And that is TTL, not CMOS.
[14:15:23] <gilberth> Not particular good for the climate. On the other hand easier to handle but the low noise immunity.
[14:16:38] <gilberth> Whould I still own my former company with its pick and place machines, I would actually consider rebuilding a CADR just for fun.
[14:16:46] <selwyn> hm
[14:16:53] <gilberth> Never mind, I am somewhat crazy.
[14:18:39] <gilberth> However, I still believe a RISC design with the same tech as in late 70s would have been faster. But: Memory was very expensive and thus it would have costed way more than the CADR design.
[14:20:32] <gilberth> The CADR didn't even have a pipeline to begin with.
[14:21:02] <selwyn> does anyone know how quick you can get data into an asic?
[14:21:57] <gilberth> Data? You mean I/O?
[14:23:33] <selwyn> yes
[14:24:19] <selwyn> gilberth: how did you get single photon sources at school?
[14:24:26] <gilberth> I never played with that. But FPGAs already are pretty fast on I/O.
[14:26:22] <gilberth> selwyn: We had some radioactive material behind some phosphor-ish screen. Radiation then would hit an atom derail an electron which then would emit a single photon.
[14:26:46] <selwyn> oh nice
[14:27:26] <selwyn> data uses that in tng when he is stranded on a pre industrial planet
[14:27:59] <gilberth> Then sit in complete darkness and stare at the screen real close and you'll notice single flashes. Amazing actually, this is why I remember that so well.
[14:30:07] <selwyn> i wonder why our eyes are that sensitive
[14:30:17] <gilberth> What I also remember well is measuring the speed of light.
[14:30:51] <gilberth> We were off by like 10% though.

[14:32:38] <gilberth> selwyn: I don't know. But night vision isn't that bad, when you allow the eye to adapt. I often read the theory that our eye somehow is made for hunting at moon light. This perhaps is why some people wear sun glasses at day.
[14:33:27] <selwyn> hm
[14:33:41] * gilberth regrets not having studied physics instead of CS. Briefly.
[14:33:57] <selwyn> considering that we can see single photons - we cannot surely be that much worse than cats
[14:34:03] <selwyn> who really live hunting at night
[14:34:11] <selwyn> gilberth: you missed out
[14:34:19] * gilberth reminds himself that he is bad at math.
[14:35:07] <gilberth> selwyn: Yes, I did. I would have learned all the CS anyway. Now I feel too olde to study again.
[14:37:38] <gilberth> selwyn: As I was younger I loved going for a walk at night. At the beach, in Danmark, with little light pollution. My mom always was a little scared though. But once you adapt, you could see pretty much anything. No colours though.
[14:38:22] <gilberth> I guess, I always was the nocturnal one. :)

[14:59:35] <Gnuxie> if you're a dayjob JS developer and you see this would you think it's ok?

[15:07:35] <Gnuxie> idk if i'm being stupid, but the aim of it is to only really have the reader have syntax rules for the terminals, the method calls and reading foo args... { body } to be macroexpanded, i haven't got a clue about the terminology for this though 
[15:08:53] <Gnuxie> oh, and have it look like some typical corpo language 
[15:09:10] <Gnuxie> which is why it's slightly dreadful 
[15:11:37] <Alfr> Gnuxie, would you throw in unwind-protect and continuations to sweeten the deal?
[15:12:01] <selwyn> damn
[15:12:10] <selwyn> and that was only the rehearsal for the air show!
[15:13:22] <selwyn> gnuxie: i think the syntax does look corpo enough
[15:13:25] <selwyn> gj
[15:13:44] <selwyn> is it meant to macroexpand into common lisp?
[15:13:47] <Gnuxie> i dunno continuation terminology, but there will be escape continuation accessible from each activation record (stack frame) and the ability to suspend the current activation record like a fiber 
[15:14:07] <Gnuxie> no it's a new language 
[15:14:35] <selwyn> i was not able to get lamb shoulder at the supermarket sigh. suspect that lidl does have shortages but they are careful to not display empty shelves in an obvious way
[15:14:48] <selwyn> gnuxie: what will it be called?
[15:15:40] <Gnuxie> dunno, it's just rubbish syntax idea to hypothetically grab JS people for the VM I've been bullshitting about (with hayley) for awhile 
[15:15:50] <selwyn> it would be very funny if it worked

[15:18:48] <selwyn> yes lol
[15:19:02] <selwyn> they outcompete the british supermarkets so easily
[15:19:14] <gilberth> Funny.
[15:19:21] <Gnuxie> hmm oki

[16:08:05] <selwyn>  a lot of food is imported
[16:08:48] <selwyn> the pound has lost some value, but i don´t know enough to say whether it makes imports more expensive yet
[16:10:41] <gilberth> Hmm, in theory it should. Does the UK export anything besides ancient TTL ALUs?

[16:11:59] <selwyn> um
[16:12:10] <selwyn> rpis are still made here right?
[16:12:24] <gilberth> And is the MINI Cooper still made in the UK?
[16:13:12] <hayley> gilberth: w.r.t your dyslexia simulator, how much does compile time increase when you change from 3 groups to 5?
[16:13:16] <edgar-rft> the Mini Cooper is the younger brother of Alice Cooper
[16:13:34] <hayley> IMO my compiler is dogshit slow.
[16:13:35] <selwyn> lets find out
[16:14:15] <selwyn> apparently yes
[16:14:22] <gilberth> hayley: You mean your DFA creation? Otherwise let me see if my compiler is in shape currently.
[16:14:53] <gilberth> selwyn: Good. I love those cars and own two and a half.
[16:16:05] <selwyn> but again the narratives are split
[16:17:29] <selwyn> remainers emphasise that honda left swindon, while brexiters highlight nissan investing more in sunderland
[16:17:39] <selwyn> people will believe in what they want for the foreseeable future
[16:18:18] <gilberth> hayley: My total compile time increased by a factor of about 2.5.
[16:20:48] <hayley> idk, I tested the Lisp compiler too and it took its sweet time.
[16:21:27] <hayley> .oO(If I can't write damn copy propagation, maybe a better liveness pass would help?)
[16:23:13] <hayley> Still, did I miss a rewrite rule? Maybe grep[] hates me?
[16:25:03] <gilberth> hayley: For a real explosion of states try X(.?){8,8}Y
[16:26:02] * hayley thinks she gets the idea.
[16:27:48] <hayley> But the Lisp compiler (both SBCL and Clozure btw) just chokes on any large DFA.
[16:29:34] <gilberth> Yes, for that example, I get like 300ms DFA construction time and 1.9s compile time. On the slow machine with CCL.
[16:30:06] <hayley> So I guess I better design my closure compiler eventually.
[16:30:38] <gilberth> When you care for online use, which I don't.
[16:31:20] <hayley> I stuck with CL to not have to wait 10 seconds for a compiler to finish.
[16:31:49] <gilberth> But yes, even working on the derivative directly for matching already makes me faster than (GNU) libc.
[16:32:24] <hayley> What, you interpret the derivatives?
[16:32:37] <gilberth> For testing, yes.
[16:33:30] <gilberth> So that when I find a glitch I could take DFA code generation out of the equation.
[16:33:34] <hayley> Sure, but that's fast?
[16:34:13] <hayley> I only used DERIVATIVE to test everything, sure. But it wouldn't be faster than any "compiler" surely.
[16:34:24] <gilberth> Fast enough for those pathological cases which trigger massive backtracking in other engines.
[16:35:15] <gilberth> But you could compile each RE (== state) to one closure for the dispatch as you go on demand.
[16:35:50] <hayley> I guess so. But you have O(string) if you don't do the similar state detection of DFA generation.
[16:36:43] <gilberth> Yes, you want to recognize similar state under the reducible function.
[16:37:51] <gilberth> In essence you compile those parts of the DFA that are actually visited while scaning, with longer input you should execute compiled code all the time.
[16:38:27] <hayley> Guess so.
[16:38:52] <gilberth> I even have that somewhere.
[16:39:22] <gilberth> But never really brushed that up, because I don't care for online use.
[16:41:36] <hayley> It's not my biggest priority, but I still can't sit around forever for the Lisp compiler to do whole RE optimization apparently.
[16:42:35] <gilberth> What is the compiler doing anyway? Does it choke on the large number of registers?
[16:43:11] <gilberth> Or the just on the size of the TAGBODY?
[16:43:41] <hayley> I think the latter, as profiling indicates it gets stuck in constraint propagation.
[16:43:53] <gilberth> ok
[16:44:01] <hayley> OTOH it does copy propagation after constraints, which means more constraints.
[16:44:44] <gilberth> Does TRULY-THE help?
[16:45:57] <hayley> No, the problem is due to more aggressive type inference I think.
[16:46:16] <hayley> Apparently today is international PROG day. Wonder who would make a day about that.
[16:46:27] <gilberth> Thus my idea to use TRULY-THE.
[16:46:39] <gilberth> hayley: PROG? The program feature?
[16:46:53] <hayley> That, or the rock.
[16:47:24] <hayley> But (at least in the Python compiler) you have the declared type and the inferred type, and the latter is a subtype of the former.
[16:47:29] <gilberth> The day of the holy GOTO. ;)
[16:47:59] <gilberth> And SETQ for that matter.
[16:48:39] * hayley can't help to wonder if liveness and "register allocation" would help at all.
[16:49:46] <gilberth> Well, idk how good the compilers actually are. For my flex(1) replacement, I just trusted on GCC doing all that for me.
[16:50:13] <hayley> Probably not. And, look, I honestly can't imagine using my own code for offline work because the backend is that damn slow.
[16:50:44] <hayley> OTOH manipulating real register allocation to avoid spills helped me significantly; go figure.
[16:50:52] <gilberth> Slow? You are at a few \tau per char already.
[16:51:16] <hayley> Compile speed.
[16:51:26] <gilberth> Does it matter?
[16:52:31] <gilberth> I mean you can't escape O(exp) here. What would rather be important would be what are the kinds of actual REs users would want to match not the pathological cases.
[16:52:57] <hayley> I guess so.
[16:53:41] <hayley> But the O(exp) states and compiler doing super-linear things makes for a lot of compile time.
[16:54:04] <gilberth> This is the whole point, we are at O(|input|) at matching, which is a great improvement already.
[16:55:07] *** Quits: Posterdati (~posterdat@host-95-235-15-123.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:11:16] <gilberth> So in essence the other engines working on NFAs leave the O(exp) to run time.
[17:14:13] <gilberth> Silly idea: Match w/o submatch addressing at first and when we have a match go over the match again with subgroup addressing. Could be a win for grep as the size of non-matched material outweights the matched material. Never considered that because a scanner has no non-matched material.
[17:16:19] <gilberth> To reduce work we could leave a trail of states visited and then execute the assignments when we actually have a match.
[17:16:40] <gilberth> No clue whether that's a win.

[19:09:13] <amirouche> I checked a webpage that states that realtime / real-time / real time have all different meanings and use!
[19:09:15] <edgar-rft> true, german acronums mostly expand into single words while americans use acronyms for whole sentences
[19:09:18] <gilberth> selwyn: Then take e.g. "landmark" versus "land mark", if you wish.
[19:09:53] <amirouche> ymmv ;)
[19:10:01] <edgar-rft> "land mark" can be an activity :-)
[19:10:52] <gilberth> It seems to me, that the more common a term gets, English too tends to form a single word. That is what I mean by "spelling issue". Where we would say "spellingissue" ;)
[19:12:35] <amirouche> spelling issue or typo.
[19:13:23] <amirouche> oh, I just backlogged, my knowledge of german is old, but IIRC they are long words.
[19:13:55] <gilberth> Sure there are long words.
[19:15:08] <gilberth> And you could construct them at will as long as you wish.
[19:15:15] <amirouche> oh i did not know that.
[19:15:35] <amirouche> that is a fun problem for computers
[19:16:10] <gilberth> It sucks, because of US dominance considering hyphenation optional.
[19:16:12] <amirouche> somehow it share similarily with CJK languages where words are not separated by a space.
[19:16:45] <amirouche> you prefere with hyphenation or without?
[19:17:23] <gilberth> With, when typesetting. Otherwise you either get a very ragged right margin or huge holes with justification.
[19:21:37] <edgar-rft> great exmaple (not made-up by weirdos) -> "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder" in germany is "Aufmerksamkeitsdefizithyperaktivitätsstörung" :-)
[19:22:05] <amirouche> ^^'
[19:22:32] <gilberth> I mean we currently have the "Bundestagswahlkampf", which will luckily will be over by tomorrow. At that is one of the shorter words. It took browsers ages to adopt hyphenation, while Closure did it 20 years ago using the TeX algorithm.
[19:23:41] <gilberth> edgar-rft: "Donaudampfschiff[f]ahrtskapitaensmueztenfabrikant" A classical example.
[19:24:54] <gilberth> But, yes, we that long words for all kind of things. Iwonderwhyistillhaveproblemswithcamelcasethough.

[19:28:45] <selwyn> yeah they have these games in turkish as well. someone set a new record recently
[19:29:08] <edgar-rft> in real life we usually avoid such super-long words or replace them by better descriptions when we're talking
[19:30:25] <dra> gilberth: I have no idea what "making fun" means.
[19:30:28] <selwyn> you can make words of arbitrary length

[19:33:15] <dra> gilberth: Hey, I'm German. What does "laugh" mean?
[19:34:55] <edgar-rft> laugh means haha :-)
[19:35:28] <gilberth> Standard dialog, that I have: Date form: __ __ __ I enter 2021-09-25 which is actually recommended by DIN 5008 and the clerk would strike it out and write "25.9.21" there.

[19:37:08] <gilberth> dra: Yes, I never got used to it.
[19:40:10] <gilberth> Anyhow, what shall I do? Figure out what the fast way is to blitter a few dozen pixels with SDL or rewrite the whole shebang? I mean: 60ms! That is ridiculous. This ought to be about no time at all.
[19:41:04] <gilberth> Actually I would like to have a second thread which just blitters the CADR frame without impeding the speed of the simulator.
[19:41:19] <gilberth> * frame buffer ; or "framebuffer"?
[19:42:59] <edgar-rft> No-joke consideration: The federal german television wants money from me, just because I have internet at home (law was changed ten years ago or something). They already sued me for paying that. Now the story:
[19:43:00] <edgar-rft> Every day I hear on TV "if you want to watch <whatever> now press the green button on your remote control". Obviously this has something to do with internet TV that I don't have. By chance my remote control *has* a green button and if I press it nothing happens. This means the federal television wants money from me for promising things that they don't deliver. I'm seriously consideing to sue them for 
[19:43:00] <edgar-rft> betrayal.
[19:44:56] <gilberth> lol. As a child I watched "Peter Lustig" and at the end of the show he would point to one corner of the screen saying "And now switch the TV off, children!" Our TV had the power switch at the other corner. Silly guy.
[19:46:00] <gilberth> edgar-rft: Indeed, this football tax is betrayal. More so because I never watch TV.
[19:46:56] <gilberth> Not since I moved out at age 18yo.
[19:47:29] <gilberth> So I am almost three decades TV-free now. Damn, I am olde.
[19:49:03] <gilberth> edgar-rft: What would happen if you paint one button green? And "green"? Seriously. Is that a political statement?
[19:49:21] <edgar-rft> I already worked for the federal television (luckily only once) and that's why I know that half of their employees are lawyers or teachers who otherwise wouldn't find a job.
[19:49:45] <gilberth> That would explain a few things.
[19:50:46] <edgar-rft> gilberth: I think they have *one* remote control for *all* their TV models and my TV is the cheapest that has no streaming TV, only the button is there.
[19:52:49] <gilberth> Hhm? People don't get their TVs from the federal broadcast stations. That's not the Bundespost.
[19:53:51] * gilberth once owned and operated an "illegal" modem at a whooping 9600bps.
[19:54:50] <dra> edgar-rft: Please sue.
[19:55:52] <edgar-rft> gilberth: that's no joke, if you have studied something with law or education they will always take you. The money from the GEZ fee is bound to the "educational mandate" (Bildingsauftrag), that's what they need the teachers for, and for political news magazines you never can have too many lawyers.

[19:57:00] <gilberth> selwyn: Do you have to pay even when you don't own a TV?
[19:57:22] <selwyn> you have to pay if you watch the bbc
[19:57:49] <gilberth> As here it's a household tax in practice as every household has to pay. No matter if you own a TV or not.
[19:57:54] <selwyn> oh
[19:57:57] <selwyn> its every channel
[19:58:06] <gilberth> selwyn: So, when I don't watch BBC I don't have to pay? Good.
[19:58:12] <selwyn> yes
[19:58:31] <selwyn> but inspectors come round insisting that you have, actually, been watching tv and so have to pay
[19:59:28] <selwyn> they shouldn´t be intimidating people on the doorstep when there´s no evidence that they have been breaking the rules
[19:59:36] <gilberth> I would be fine with that. What bothers me is that I have to pay for luxurious pensions and football without even owning a TV or watching any otherwise.
[19:59:43] <edgar-rft> gilberth: the practical problem is that the law was changed in two ways: 1) they can demand money from you if you have internet, totally independent whether you watch TV or not 2) the federal broadcast now are *themselves* responsible to get their money, it's not a public tax anymore. The problem is now that they don't have enough people for proper administration.
[20:00:38] <gilberth> edgar-rft: Every household has to pay, even when they don't have internet, TV. No exception.
[20:01:27] <gilberth> And this is silly in the days of DRM, which was not possible with pure analogue TV.
[20:02:17] <gilberth> Or radio for that matter.
[20:02:27] <edgar-rft> do it like me and pile up the bills biut never pay - they currently want something around 3500 Euros from me :-)
[20:03:07] <gilberth> Do they charge interest?
[20:03:51] <edgar-rft> no idea, I must look to tell the truth... - but I haven't planned to ever pay it
[20:05:01] <gilberth> They will get you! Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean that nobody is after you. :-)
[20:05:51] <edgar-rft> not even the german army got me so far :-)
[20:06:12] <edgar-rft> the funny thig is that they sued me and they won (what surprise) but *they* had a lot of work and still no money
[20:06:44] <gilberth> The army sued you?
[20:07:32] <gilberth> Or the Gebühreneinzugszentrale?
[20:08:13] <gilberth> Funny how both is called "einziehen" :)
[20:08:33] <edgar-rft> the Südwestfunk sued me, the army police (Feldjäger) once were at my parents but my father was clever enough to say that he has no clue where I am and they might tell him if they found me (no joke)
[20:09:25] <gilberth> Yep. Damn Feldjäger, forcing you to be educated in killing people.

[20:20:00] *** Joins: tophullyte (tophullyte@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/tophullyte)
[20:21:12] <edgar-rft> Funy stories about the german army. The drafting office (Kreiswehrersatzamt) always sent me letters because they wanted me to appear for medical examinations. But at the army such letters are official deeds (Urkunden) and we weren't germany if there weren't a german law how official deeds have to be delivered.
[20:21:12] <edgar-rft> If a deed is delivered by a "third person" (e.g. by post) it must be done in a re-traceable way, e.g. by "certified mail" (Einschreiben). If you send a deed as an ordinary letter the deed looses its special status and becomes an ordinary piece of paper that I can ignore and toss into the trash with no wayto make me responisble for that in any way.
[20:21:12] <edgar-rft> We discussed this for more than ten years (and seven or eight medical examinations) and I think they haven't understood at any time. But fact is that until today I wasn't a single day at the german army. Hoorray :-)
[20:22:27] <selwyn> prince andrew tried something similar to avoid getting served papers by a us court
[20:22:32] <selwyn> he was not as successful as you :)
[20:24:00] <edgar-rft> I was just simply lucky that my father really didn't know where I was when the army police were searching for me. That was *really* close, but they didn't get me :-)

[20:35:42] * gilberth always forgets that the CADR is using octal by default.
[20:36:35] <edgar-rft> gilberth: I was homeless at that time, but it turned out afterwards that it saved me from the army. So whatever happens to you, it's always good for something.
[20:37:50] <gilberth> They didn't try again later?
[20:38:22] <edgar-rft> I think they were enervated after ten years and finally gave up :-)
[20:41:08] <edgar-rft> There is an army law somewhere that says that if your last examination is more than two years ago, they must start over from the beginning. I assume that would have needed too much time.
[20:42:44] <gilberth> I see.
[20:50:05] <ck_> and when was this?

[21:52:26] <gilberth> Anyhow, when I use a second thread which just blasts the whole frame buffer via X11 to the display server each 16ms, this is way more responsive.
[22:02:41] <Gnuxie> my syntax idea earlier is dumb
[22:03:00] <Gnuxie> one of the first things some corpo will try is 3 + 4
[22:03:49] <Gnuxie> so to accomidate for that i tried to put semicolons on the end of expressions that were not infinx, everything else therefor would be parsed as infix, which is a totally big brain move until you realise that...
[22:04:12] <gilberth> Why do you care about corpo?
[22:04:15] <Gnuxie> whenever someone misses a semicolon they're going to get the mother of all obscure annoying error messages about infix 
[22:05:11] <Gnuxie> well, it's really about the people who work for them, most programmers who are good will be doing it for a living right, and if they are doing it for a living they're familiar with bullshit 
[22:07:09] <gilberth> Yes, and why do you care for those?
[22:07:34] <Gnuxie> because I cannot build an ecosystem alone 
[22:07:50] <gilberth> You need an ecosystem?
[22:08:05] <Gnuxie> yes.
[22:08:35] <Gnuxie> i don't want to write everything from scratch
[22:08:52] <gilberth> And because you do you want to torture yourself with some bogus syntax?
[22:09:26] <Gnuxie> well, it's not actually that bad 
[22:10:12] <selwyn> i would suggest that, if the goal is really to make something intuitive for ´outsiders´ to use, then you should go to the effort of marketing it to likely users and getting feedback from them
[22:10:26] <selwyn> which is no doubt a hell of a lot of work, but without it the risk of making something they don´t want to use
[22:10:30] <selwyn> is simply too high
[22:10:33] <Gnuxie> yeah
[22:10:50] <selwyn> i cannot guess what a js programmer would think
[22:11:18] <gilberth> Heck, when you want to win a popularity context use some C-ish syntax.
[22:11:28] <gilberth> contest
[22:11:58] <Gnuxie> well it is sort of cish 
[22:12:12] <gilberth> let (x 10) is C-ish?
[22:12:18] * Gnuxie sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/a4261b727caf0ac43258afd4901eb09a3061730d
[22:12:21] <Gnuxie> this is the latest version 
[22:12:25] <gilberth> "var x = 10;" would have been.
[22:12:38] <Gnuxie> well
[22:12:45] <gilberth> well
[22:12:50] <Gnuxie> lol
[22:13:02] <selwyn> why is 3 + 4 there
[22:13:07] <selwyn> is that meant to be a return value?
[22:13:10] <Gnuxie> to show how infix would work 
[22:13:10] <gilberth> Use commas and semicolons, I would suggest.
[22:13:19] <selwyn> oh
[22:13:43] <gilberth> You will have fun parsing let x = a b = 20 c = 30 otherwise.
[22:14:43] <Gnuxie> well, you see the reason this syntax has so many curly braces is because that `let` can be implemented sort of like (defmacro let ((&rest foo) &body the-bits-in-the-curly))
[22:15:40] <Gnuxie> then that macro can have fun destructuring that and all the pain is isolated 
[22:17:50] <gilberth> https://termbin.com/o2n5  ;and c-mode already is quite happy.
[22:18:36] <gilberth> Gnuxie: Yes. About that 'let' of yours: This already is pretty alien to a JS hacker.
[22:19:19] <gilberth> C syntax works be having a distinction between expressions and statements and declarations.
[22:20:15] <Gnuxie> ok, i just want to make it clear to you that this would be read into something like this 
[22:20:32] * Gnuxie sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/82dd5d366432ec177d371cb4d0b9bc1f701f2a91
[22:20:46] <gilberth> So IMHO you enter a kind of uncanny valley here. As more as you look like C, the more people would expect a syntax pretty near to C at least in the most broad sense.
[22:21:21] <Gnuxie> yeah you're quite right 
[22:21:45] <gilberth> Gnuxie: I suppose the '=' would be an infix operator, too. Otherwise I see your point.
[22:22:08] <Gnuxie> well, i'm trying to avoid operators entirely but maybe this is a waste of time 
[22:22:50] <gilberth> Sorry, Gnuxie. I am just giving you some input on what I believe syntax would do here to a JS hacker.
[22:23:35] <Gnuxie> hmm, i see 
[22:23:48] <gilberth> On that note: foo(x y z) instead of foo(x, y, z) would sure be strange enough. IMHO. This is something people even have in their muscle memory.
[22:24:13] <Gnuxie> yeah that's also a good point 
[22:26:27] <gilberth> I would contemplate the LISP and Dylan route. Both have "normal" syntax, the former has M-expressions and the latter its Pascal'ish syntax, but s-expressions beneath.
[22:29:38] <Gnuxie> well, i guess either way my operator purity has to end, simply because there will have to be stuff like it e.g. for anonymous functions

[22:47:36] *** Quits: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:48:28] <Gnuxie> so, the plan was for people to be able to use a JS like language on this VM while i actually implemented everything with a nice 'lisp', but i am wondering if that is a bad approach simply because if someone wanted to contribute, fix a bug or read some code we wrote, they wouldn't be able to  
[22:48:35] <Gnuxie> This is why i was hunting for this compromise between the two
[22:51:10] <Gnuxie> unless i do something unprecedented, which is to print code identical to what was read so that lisp -> IR -> Js-like -> IR -> lisp was the same 
[22:51:30] <Gnuxie> that seems really quite stupid though 
[22:52:16] <Gnuxie> this would also imply that all programs would have to be serialized to the IR and lived in version control that way too 
[22:54:17] <Gnuxie> it's not a bad idea, but there are too many unique things going on and this is another bombshell 
[22:54:59] <Gnuxie> it's actually a great idea 
[22:55:08] <Gnuxie> but a pita to get right 
[22:55:23] <Gnuxie> I'm not sure how many people have gotten autoformatting right
[22:58:51] <Gnuxie> ok no this doensn't work at all 
[22:59:07] <Gnuxie> i forget macros are a thing 
[22:59:35] <Gnuxie> it would work if there were no macros 
[23:03:36] <gilberth> Hugh? PPRINT exists, doesn't it?
[23:05:53] <Gnuxie> well yes, but you don't read that and get the code before macroexpansion 
[23:06:25] <Gnuxie> i'll be back later
[23:18:23] <edgar-rft> ck_: the time when the german army wanted to get me was from 1982 to the early 1990s, in 1991 the army police was at my parents to search for me, at the end of 1991 I moved to the appartment where I still live today, after that I heard nothing from the army anymore.
[23:20:35] <aeth> Right, but 1991 was when world peace was achieved, so they probably stopped caring about the army by then.
[23:21:07] <aeth> sorry, 1992, not 1991. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_history
[23:21:23] <aeth> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man
[23:22:11] <ck_> aeth: german bureucracy doesn't easily stop caring, especially if it doesn't really matter. seems like an achievement by edgar
[23:22:48] <ck_> so, congratulations. I award you one imaginary image of a leopard two, or something. Maybe the NFT to the imaginary image
[23:23:10] <aeth> Well, 'bureaucracy' is French. You can tell because German bureaucrats would need to make it a compound word out of at least 6 or 7 words
[23:23:50] <ck_> 'Bürokratie' doesn't seem that far off
[23:24:21] <gilberth> Which still is French, sortof. How about "Verwaltung"?
[23:24:22] <aeth> make up a plausible fake word that sounds better than the actual word, then. Nobody will notice.
[23:24:59] <ck_> HANDZETTELABLAGEFACHABTEILUNG ZWEI
[23:26:13] <aeth> I mean, we all make fun of the German bureaucratic naming convention, but the Anglosphere does the same thing with long names
[23:26:23] <aeth> They just like to turn it into a 'backronym'
[23:27:09] <gilberth> I still love the "Merkbefreiungsantragsformular".
[23:27:24] <aeth> e.g. if the American 'bureaucracy' came up with the name for it, they'd probably call it something like 'SOOP' for Structured Office Organization Protocol
[23:27:35] <aeth> Technically, the names are longer than what Germans think of... they just put them into an acronym
[23:30:12] <aeth> And the words don't have to make sense in any kind of word order. It just needs to spell out something pronounceable
[23:31:08] <aeth> Then they can say, "You need your SOOP!" Definitely better branding than "You need a bureaucracy!"
[23:31:09] <gilberth> The CADR simulator handling of the console is fubar.
[23:31:46] <Alfr> aeth, I wonder how well defined that protocol is.
[23:31:55] <aeth> Alfr: it's an ANSI standard
[23:32:11] <Alfr> wtf?!

[23:32:38] <aeth> (but there's probably something very close to what I'm talking about that is one)
[23:33:34] <Alfr> I guess no office correctly implements any such specification.
[23:34:01] <gilberth> Well, there is a DIN standard about how a letter is to be formatted.
[23:34:12] <aeth> I mean
[23:34:26] <aeth> if you're talking about office politics, there are many rule books going back centuries, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order
[23:34:51] <Alfr> gilberth, I know and it's bull. Most I receive (and send) don't conform to it.
[23:35:14] <aeth> letterwriting is a lost art
[23:35:37] <aeth> it's not even a Boomer thing, it's the generation before that
[23:35:42] <aeth> Boomers just called people on the phone
[23:36:03] <gilberth> Alfr: Those rules are followed most of the time, at least in the broader sense. And I use dinbrief.sty.
[23:36:32] <gilberth> aeth: beach wrote a rule book?
[23:37:10] <aeth> yes, but it washed away at high tide
