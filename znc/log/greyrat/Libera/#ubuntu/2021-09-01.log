[04:22:29] <guiverc> Croran, I keep getting errors with the telegram snap that it's outdated; but it's the latest snap.. that could be why you can't get passed 'verify identity' (they've updated version but not their snap)    You could raise ticket on https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues  (I may next time my error appears & I take a screenshot of it)

[04:23:05] <Croran> guiverc: Thanks!
[04:23:28] <sarnold> guiverc: does the snap need an update?
[04:23:41] <sarnold> guiverc: maybe the upstream folks have new software but the snap author hasn't updated yet
[04:23:44] <guiverc> `snap refresh` tells me all updated
[04:23:51] <Croran> guiverc: i'm not particularly interested in telegram, but was interested enough to try it after hearing that it was a well-maintained snap. Just because I've seen so few good snaps.
[04:23:56] <guiverc> that's what I believe sarnold
[04:24:40] <guiverc> the link I provided was from snapcraft.io as contact author link for snap
[04:24:48] <sarnold> ah!
[04:24:55] <guiverc> https://snapcraft.io/telegram-desktop
[04:26:59] <Croran> also confusing that it's 'telegram desktop' and not just telegram. when snap install telegram failed, i did a web search and the page that came up called it telegram.desktop, so i tried that and still no luck. so i had to figure out the snap 'search' syntax to manually search for its name.

[06:58:05] <black_13> i like having qt where i can step into the qt source

[06:59:39] <black_13> i dont know know
[06:59:51] <black_13> or know
[07:00:26] <black_13> or could i just get all the dependencies for qt5 and the build a hybrid?

[07:01:20] <black_13> that gets messy

[07:15:05] <sarnold> black_13: it's ever so slightly different, sbuild can use schroot, which manages chroots
[07:17:31] <black_13> i remember going down this path it was not smooth

[07:18:40] <black_13> sarnold, thanks i appreciate the notes
[07:19:08] <sarnold> black_13: heh, yeah.. there's some notes on sbuild here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SimpleSbuild
[07:19:19] <sarnold> I wish there were an easier way to build packages. it feels like there really ought to be.
[07:19:43] <black_13> I had this car that only I could drive
[07:19:48] <black_13> i could baby it
[07:19:50] <sarnold> a lot of folks prefer pbuilder, it might be that simpler tool, but sbuild is very close to the builder used on launchpad, so it is more useful when preparing packages for launchpad

[15:47:06] <rbasak> linux_daemon: Ubuntu 20.04 ships with file 5.38. The point of using Ubuntu 18.04 and not upgrading to a newer Ubuntu release *is* to not upgrade packages to newer versions. You can hack something together but it won't be supportable or receive security updates.

[16:00:46] <donofrio> then you didn't remove it
[16:00:46] <linux_daemon> guess an upgrade to 20.04 is the proper way to go
[16:01:12] <donofrio> ;)
[16:01:42] <donofrio> I mean is 20.04 LTS folks or?
[16:02:17] <linux_daemon> what?
[16:02:24] <donofrio> perhaps (unsure if ubuntu does what redhat does) a backpported version of 5.32 exist in a repo?
[16:03:14] <donofrio> !LTS
[16:03:14] <ubottu> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions are supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Focal (Focal Fossa 20.04). Ubuntu !flavors may have different support durations, check their release notes for information.

[22:52:38] <Daemoen> is it still recommended to use apt-get in non-interactive scripting scenarios, or is it recommended to use apt finally;  i remember that there were some api issues with apt in older releases (ubuntu 20.04)
[22:52:46] <sarnold> BinarySavior: does docker switch to using a different user id before spawning znc?
[22:52:53] <sarnold> BinarySavior: why not just run the znc directly from systemd?
[22:53:18] <sarnold> Daemoen: probably best to stick to apt-get, I think apt's interface is 'free to change'
[22:54:12] <BinarySavior> i've always just used the docker container, i'm not sure if docker itself switches to another user

[23:06:17] <leftyfb> omega_doom: so you have 2 physical storage devices in your laptop and you want Windows on one and Ubuntu on the other? And you don't want Ubuntu modifying the EFI partition on the Windows drive (why not?)? Maybe don't do an EFI install of ubuntu and select your ubuntu drive for the MBR?
[23:06:34] <sarnold> BinarySavior: probably adding a user to the 'docker' group is equivalent to root access on your computer

[23:08:02] <omega_doom> leftyfb: Yes, i want independent installion so that ubuntu will boot on different laptop.
[23:08:55] <leftyfb> omega_doom: ok, so the storage device you are using isn't internal to the laptop. Then disable EFI temporarily and do an MBR install to your external device

[23:10:34] <omega_doom> leftyfb: yes, it is external. Do i need to choose mbr option in the ubuntu installer and everything will be ok?
[23:11:34] <leftyfb> omega_doom: I think if you disable (U)EFI from your BIOS/system, it should do an MBR install. Also, why not just disable your internal storage from the BIOS?

[23:16:35] <TJ-> omega_doom: as in, boot in "Try..." mode so you have the Live Desktop then use a terminal shell to prepare the target device before starting the installer; that'll then let the installer's partitioning/boot-loader selection steps 'see' the target as a valid target for installing a boot-loader to
[23:16:42] <omega_doom> leftyfb: Do you think creation of EFI-SP on external drive will work?

[23:24:36] <leftyfb> omega_doom: to be clear, switching EFI off was only a temporary step to get it installed to the MBR of your external device. After that you could re-enable EFI and both should boot just fine. Either way. Good luck
