[01:01:05] <schneider> today i became the proud owner of two Meinberg GPSDOs. They come without antennas though and the issue is that Meinberg does some down conversion in their active antennas. Does someone know what exaclty they do there?
[01:03:47] <schneider> It looks like they down convert GPS L1 to 35.42 MHz. The datasheet also mention 10 Mhz though. I'm wondering what the 10 MHz do / who generates them / if they are visible on the antenna output

[14:12:36] <[Sec]> it seems gnuradio 3.9.3 broke the python bindings. I get a lot of ... https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git 
[14:13:03] <[Sec]> i mean referenced unknown base type "gr::sync_block"
[14:17:19] <[Sec]> i find some mails on the mailinglist that this happened with pybind11 v2.4 while the gnuradio PPA was using v2.5. - I am using pybind11 2.5 -  Has the pybind11 version of the PPA changed again?

[14:39:45] <[Sec]> well, even with pybind11 2.9 it doesn't work anymore
[14:40:29] <willcode4[m]> Debian 11 and Ubuntu 21.04 have 2.6 and Ubuntu 20.04 has 2.4, so I'd guess the PPA is built against one of those version. Not sure where 2.5 came in.
[14:42:06] <[Sec]> i give up. Using gnuradio without building everything from source seems to break differently every time i try to touch it.
[14:46:57] <[Sec]> willcode: 2.5 comes from the gnuradio ppa. It is also what's noted in https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GNU_Radio_3.9_OOT_Module_Porting_Guide
[14:49:38] <drmpeg> I had a user of my OOT's with this problem. Building and installing pybind11 v2.5.0 fixed it.
[14:50:38] <drmpeg> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnuradio/2021-10/msg00108.html
[14:53:20] <willcode4[m]> [Sec]: We're finding that PPAs are hard, obviously, and we are thinking about better ways to package (e.g., maybe Conda). Too many dependencies and targets, too few people to sort it all out. PPAs seem like a convenient way to get the latest stuff out to users before distros package it, but ...

[15:03:50] <[Sec]> will: it is just so frustrating. Trying to get people to switch from 3.8 to 3.9, but every time I touch it, something new is broken. I thought much of the value of gnuradio was in the OOT stuff. But it's becoming a full-time job to keep anything running.
