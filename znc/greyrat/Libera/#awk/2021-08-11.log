[21:15:52] <thebombzen> is there a way to give awk a maximum number of fields?
[21:16:51] <thebombzen> I'm trying to parse output using awk and extract certain fields, but the last field of this particular command output can contain arbitrary ascii printable text as a comment string
[21:19:50] <yitz> You can loop over fields from 1 to some max field

[22:01:31] <yitz> Yeah. Set 1-N to "" and print $0. Or print N-NF but that butchers double spaces
[22:05:24] <thebombzen> yitz: looks like that preservs FS
[22:05:31] <thebombzen> so I end up with `a      b`
[22:05:38] <thebombzen> which is fine, I guess, since it's ultimately just being parsed by something else
[22:06:08] <thebombzen> the suggestiion linked mentions sub() but copypasting it (with appropriate n changed to what I want) didn't work
[22:06:33] <thebombzen> that said erasing the fields I dont' need and printing $0 seems to do the trick, thanks
[22:06:39] <yitz> Yeah. You can modify the $0 and re-split
[22:06:54] <thebombzen> does resplitting require GNU awk?
[22:07:09] <thebombzen> the page linked above seemed to imply that split() was a gawk extension
[22:09:15] <yitz> I forget how you prompt it to resplit fields. I think setting FS=FS does it

[23:10:17] <axisys_> I am not sure how to add a for loop in awk to print rest of the elements to make it look like OUTPUT
[23:10:20] <axisys_> https://dpaste.org/vyDU
[23:13:21] <e36freak> why are grep and sed involved? you just want to pull the server name and put it at the beginning and leave everything else alone?

[23:16:28] <axisys_> almost .. need to add ansible_host=<IP>
[23:16:35] <axisys_> this ugly hack worked
[23:16:37] <axisys_> grep -v '^#' /tmp/ini | sed 's/server_name=/server_name /g' | awk '/^10/ {printf "%s ansible_host=%s ", $3,$1} {for(i=4;i<=NF;i++) printf "%s ", $i} !/^10/ {print}
[23:16:46] <axisys_> but I bet you have a simpler solution
[23:17:18] <axisys_> e36freak: ^
[23:17:28] <e36freak> awk '/^10/ {name=$2; sub(/server_name=/, "", name); printf("%s ansible_host=%s\n", name, $0); next} !/^#/' /tmp/ini
[23:21:07] <axisys_> man awk works magic. thank you! I am trying to find out how next replaces the whole for loop
[23:21:40] <axisys_> ah.. $0 did catch all elements.. so what does `next` do?
