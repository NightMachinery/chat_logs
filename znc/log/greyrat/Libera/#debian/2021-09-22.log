[00:06:25] <greycat> what are you doing to your computer that's causing so much corruption?
[00:07:22] <knstn> They are not many. Out of 30 files for example, 5 could report corruption. Normal usage desktop.
[00:07:34] <PerfDave> I'd still be worried about that TBH
[00:07:45] <greycat> That is highly suspect.
[00:07:47] <PerfDave> It indicates that your system is failing to correctly write files to disk.
[00:09:25] <knstn> The error is always "Data object's entry array not sorted"
[00:09:57] <greycat> The number of files that reported an error for me was zero.

[07:53:36] <willow> works great for home where i use the same AP.  not sure how easy it will be to configure other APs when traveling
[07:55:56] <willow> guess i can use iwlist and then 'wpa_passphrase <ap> <password> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp4s0.conf'.   not sure what networkd will do when it boots and there are multiple network entries in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp4s0.conf
[07:56:02] <Mr_Quick> It looks like it's a go and systemd will now file your taxes for you if you live in the US.

[13:11:01] <shtrb> Khepra, some browsers use DOH by default

[13:11:57] <Khepra> shtrb: that's different and afaik not default on debian? or did that change?
[13:12:13] <shtrb> Thankfully not changed
[13:12:22] <jelly> (or dnsmasq or run any decent recursor on each machine on a loopback ip, unbound, pdns-recursor)
[13:12:24] <shtrb> But if you had that enabled resolv.conf would not be used at all
[13:12:56] <Khepra> jelly: just ran a test strace with some python programs, I have to check if python is built as you suggest, but it's stating /etc/resolv.conf on each attept of http.client.HTTPSConnect

[13:16:26] <Khepra> so that's why in my experience, resolv.conf is consulted at runtime of processes, ie. you can change resolvers, running procs will comply (except browses, as they cache, unless you disable that cache)
[13:16:50] <jelly> Khepra, libresolv is part of glibc

[20:16:04] <Mathisen> so i just did a re-install of debian on a machine i had. during the install of bullseye it could not remove old LVM containers during install, it complained the kernel did not suport it. is this a common thing ?

I have a 2nd SSD with another, and when I boot to it and back to the main OS, system time needs to get adjusted. This is causing journald to try to write to a file that belongs to the future...

[21:10:49] <PerfDave> Mathisen: It does seem unusual; the Debian installer can create and remove new LVM PVs, VGs and LVs so it should be able to remove old ones too.
[21:11:43] <Mathisen> PerfDave, exactly what i was thinking, thats why i bring this up.
[21:12:22] <Mathisen> the older lvm PV,s was created by proxmox so this could be replicded to test if it happend again

[23:53:24] <WormFood> What is the name of the utility that will install a .deb from the command line, and automatically install any other packages it depends on? It's a great tool, I just can't remember the damn name of it.

[23:54:07] <greycat> !apt install
[23:54:07] <dpkg> You can specify a pathname to a manually downloaded .deb file in apt install, but it must begin with / or ./ or ../ or else apt thinks it's a package name. E.g. "apt install ./foo-1.2.deb". This supersedes <gdebi>.
[23:56:56] <WormFood> greycat, I just tried that, but it complains that it is missing a dependancy, which exists, but it won't automatically install it. Did I overlook some other optopn or something?

[23:58:05] <tjcarter> is gdebi considered to be obsolete now?
[23:58:30] <WormFood> I recognize that name. If it is obsolete, then what would replace it?

[23:59:48] <WormFood> bullseye still has it, so I assume it hasn't been considered obsolete yet
[23:59:58] <tjcarter> WormFood: gdebi was a program that was a little less than strictly necessary. It would do what apt does to resolve dependencies, install both package and dependencies, etc.
