[00:07:22] * John_Ivan ponders
[00:07:44] <John_Ivan> I guess the simplest possible way is just "bundle install --standalone"
[00:08:09] <John_Ivan> now to look for some books..

[01:17:44] <weaksauce> standalone ruby is kinda a deadish thing
[01:18:29] <weaksauce> docker is just about the best way to get something multi platform and repeatable though
[01:18:38] <weaksauce> that said it does increase the complexity
[01:21:49] <ox1eef> John_Ivan: yeah, that definitely makes life easier in terms of packaging
[01:22:17] <ox1eef> weaksauce: docker is fine for devs, i dont think its fine for deploying a consumer-destined app. theyll have no clue what docker is.
[01:22:53] <weaksauce> oh that's what he wants it for?
[01:31:31] *** Quits: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap) (Excess Flood)
[01:31:55] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, hey mate, long time no see.
[01:32:04] <weaksauce> howdy John_Ivan 
[01:32:24] <John_Ivan> if by deadish you mean, as dead as "exe" or the "desktop" is, yeah, I know. but that doesn't bother me.
[01:32:42] <John_Ivan> my goal is to pop in a ruby standalone module that's self written and have it work.
[01:32:52] <John_Ivan> without internet access. so offline
[01:32:53] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[01:33:11] <weaksauce> oh i meant dead as in the maintainers that started most of them have moved on
[01:33:21] <weaksauce> i'm not aware of any active maintainers 
[01:33:27] <John_Ivan> ah
[01:33:38] <John_Ivan> can't be helped.
[01:33:46] <weaksauce> they should still work for some definition of work though
[01:34:03] <weaksauce> what kind of thing are you trying to make?
[01:34:14] *** Quits: Sheilong (uid293653@id-293653.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:34:42] <weaksauce> the only project that i can think of that is actively maintained is a game engine that is standalone 
[01:34:58] <weaksauce> but you are stuck with mruby and all that entails wrt gems
[01:35:27] <weaksauce> https://dragonruby.org/
[01:35:46] <weaksauce> oh yeah and rubymotion 
[01:36:00] <John_Ivan> hmm. yeah, I'll take a look at those, thanks
[01:36:11] <John_Ivan> but I don't mind installing the ruby interpreter.
[01:36:23] <John_Ivan> when I say standalone, I don't necessarily mean embed ruby with the package
[01:36:36] <John_Ivan> I just mean "it should run, given that the gems needed come along"
[01:36:59] <weaksauce> ah
[01:37:17] <John_Ivan> bundler does miracles on this one, as I can see. to a point.
[01:37:22] <John_Ivan> `bundle install --standalone`
[01:37:31] <John_Ivan> with a defined Gemfile
[01:37:44] <weaksauce> docker images seem to be what you would want?
[01:37:47] <John_Ivan> the only thing that worries me are ruby gems that are compiled.
[01:37:50] <weaksauce> precompiled
[01:38:19] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, nah. not docker.
[01:38:49] <John_Ivan> anyway, I was just saying that, as I can see, some gems, such as ffi, requires I have the devkit version of ruby which compiles the gem on the platform you're on
[01:39:08] <John_Ivan> if I package said application on windows, I suspect bundler will make it standalone for windows but not have it work on linux for example
[01:39:16] <John_Ivan> IF I don't recompile that gem there that is.
[01:39:53] <John_Ivan> but as long as this happens with "non-pure" ruby gems
[01:39:55] <John_Ivan> I'm happy.
[01:41:05] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, I wrote an abomination today in watir
[01:41:10] <John_Ivan> an abomination that works
[01:41:17] <weaksauce> hah well that's something then
[01:41:17] <John_Ivan> frankenruby.
[01:42:36] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, yeah, I have taken a new policy to my main machine about a month ago, going offline-first mindset
[01:42:58] <John_Ivan> stacked up on setup installers, portable zips and whatnot. I intend to stay on a frozen OS for the next 10 yeras.
[01:43:12] <John_Ivan> so I need my ruby scripts to work without internet :)
[01:43:31] <John_Ivan> I'm not happy with the direction Win10/11 is going.
[01:44:02] <John_Ivan> And Linux gaming has reached a mature level already with proton. I say a few more years and I'll eventually switch permanently. But I prefer 10 years of stability than 10 years of ups and downs.

[01:44:33] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, it won't be long before 99% of windows games will run on linux with little to no tweaks thanks to proton/wine and GE
[01:44:49] <John_Ivan> and we're talking big AAA titles like Skyrim, Farcry 6, The Witcher, etc
[01:44:54] <John_Ivan> Apex Legends already works.
[01:44:55] <weaksauce> yeah it's impressive
[01:45:44] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, did you order a Steam Deck? ;)
[01:45:59] <John_Ivan> https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck
[01:46:17] <John_Ivan> steam gaming. handheld.
[01:46:20] <weaksauce> i didn't
[01:46:25] <weaksauce> looks neat though
[01:46:35] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, yup. it runs on Arch
[01:46:50] <John_Ivan> that handheld device runs arch with a kde desktop and a bunch of other wrappers making gaming sleek
[01:47:03] <John_Ivan> and it's powerful enough to run pretty much most high end games on steam
[01:47:16] * John_Ivan explodes due to hype
[01:51:03] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiENvviVSO4&t=5m41s
[01:51:08] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, play this around the house
[01:51:13] <John_Ivan> and smile *grin*
[01:54:36] <John_Ivan> it's your chance to pretend to be italian
[01:55:16] <nakilon> TIL: you can have two Homebrew installations _Oo https://github.com/tenderlove/hatstone
[01:55:29] <mooff> i haven't tried bundle install --standalone, but if you don't mind relying on Ruby being installed, sounds like a great way to go
[01:55:42] <John_Ivan> :)
[01:56:11] <John_Ivan> mooff, it's because I have offline installers on disk. ruby + devkit 3.1.1 are offline for me
[01:56:15] <John_Ivan> so I can just install it.
[01:56:31] <John_Ivan> gems not so much. hence why I want to try to make some packages standalone
[01:57:31] <John_Ivan> nakilon, stone of hat :)

[02:00:15] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, that would work too
[02:00:48] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, would need something like apt-mirror tho :P
[02:01:01] <John_Ivan> gem-mirror!

[02:05:39] <John_Ivan> mooff, why did you say you "sadly" never leave this place? :D
[02:05:53] <John_Ivan> not leaving is a good thing
[02:08:34] <mooff> John_Ivan: i think that was ox1eef 
[02:08:44] <mooff> lol
[02:08:44] <John_Ivan> mooff, sorry.
[02:08:47] <John_Ivan> ox1eef, **
[02:14:10] <ox1eef> oh just a joke. i'm connected here all the time through a droplet.
[02:14:40] <John_Ivan> :)
[02:18:14] <ox1eef> it is certainly a nice place to discuss ruby and programming. way better than twitter and the like.
[02:19:58] <John_Ivan> ox1eef, good to hear. Been looking for such a place myself. I'm a refugee from the world of programming.
[02:21:11] *** Joins: constxd (~brad@142.134.78.128)
[02:22:12] <John_Ivan> ox1eef, I've strangled with python, gotten rust over my shoes, C'd my way out of the coffeescript department, commited C#-acide and worst of all, I used the verb "Go" instead of "went" when I tried to get out of that place.
[02:23:21] <John_Ivan> I just couldn't find any middle ground. C/C++ is my main area but it sadly requires far too much effort and lines of code to get something done in it.
[02:23:40] <John_Ivan> and relying on frameworks usually involves a lot of config
[02:24:45] <constxd> nice
[02:24:55] <constxd> take the ruby pill
[02:24:59] <John_Ivan> languages like python cause my eyes to be lost
[02:25:05] <John_Ivan> too much whitespace
[02:25:14] <John_Ivan> can tell where something starts but not where it ends
[02:25:19] <John_Ivan> constxd, ye
[02:25:41] <John_Ivan> ruby on the other hand clicked. good balance. sane syntax. high level enough to consider.
[02:26:12] <John_Ivan> docs are also somewhat better. at least, so far... I do have SOME complaints but not as many as other languages.
[02:26:34] <John_Ivan> python docs are like "woah.... is that an object... of what type bruh?"
[02:26:56] <constxd> i have a question for you ruby kings
[02:28:03] <John_Ivan> enumerating processes in C requires (and I shit you not) exactly 72 lines of code.
[02:28:13] <John_Ivan> something ruby does in 1-3 lines... 
[02:28:24] <John_Ivan> it's like - "C: Suffer bitch..."
[02:28:46] <John_Ivan> constxd, anyway, I'm done talking to myself. Go ahead.

[02:30:17] <constxd> John_Ivan: that doesn't sound right 72 lines?
[02:30:27] <constxd> wtf are u doing
[02:31:45] <John_Ivan> constxd, yes. Win32 has an "ancient" function called CreateToolhelpSnapshot32Snapshot() to further call ProcessFirst() and ProcessNext() in order to traverse module lists.
[02:31:46] <John_Ivan> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/toolhelp/taking-a-snapshot-and-viewing-processes
[02:32:06] <constxd> oh i was thinking linux
[02:32:14] <John_Ivan> constxd, nah. linux is cool.
[02:32:18] <John_Ivan> linux isn't windows
[02:32:19] <John_Ivan> :P
[02:32:27] <constxd> yeah win32 is very special
[02:32:52] <John_Ivan> constxd, win32 complexity is equivalent to xorg raw geometry complexity.
[02:32:59] <John_Ivan> making a gui feels like lifting mountains
[02:33:09] * John_Ivan complains about his spine
[02:33:50] <John_Ivan> a simple window that handles layout management, some control events and such (take an IRC window) would be about 800 lines of code.
[02:34:04] <John_Ivan> I fucking counted!
[02:35:04] <John_Ivan> constxd, anyway, win32 is an interesting area. I like it, I just hate how much I have to work to get anything done.
[02:36:10] <John_Ivan> constxd, don't ever write a GUI in win32
[02:36:15] <John_Ivan> you will die
[02:36:42] <John_Ivan> by the time you reach 3k lines of code, you will look at your ambitious looking wordpad app

[03:17:21] <mooff> win32 is nice in that it's stable and relatively functional
[03:17:44] <mooff> i hope it gets ported to wasm, including win32 forms
[03:18:56] <mooff> the best gems are totally undocumented and lack tests, right?
[03:19:08] <mooff> finally published the IRC code i've been working on \o/ https://github.com/awfulcooking/iirc
[03:20:49] <ox1eef> the win32 api is very powerful though, and actually quite usable from ruby.

[03:35:15] <John_Ivan> it's flexible, yes.
[03:43:26] <John_Ivan> how odd. my `elseif` isn't getting caught.

[04:09:50] <Synthead> I have a rails app I'm running in development mode.  When I attempt to load a page locally in a browser (from rails s, puma), I get a 404 on my css: 
[04:09:55] <Synthead> ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/assets/application-e2086e7131a4274bb31552c356e4258029bcd14fdb61d04c33c225fffadcdb8a.css"):

[04:49:15] <mooff> John_Ivan: he's recommending File.write(path, contents) over File.open(path) { f.write(contents) } when you can get away with it
[04:52:25] <John_Ivan> mooff, ah. well, yeah. makes sense. I generally end up relying on a buffer if my data in memory is bigger than 25MB
[04:52:42] <John_Ivan> otherwise, load it all up without worries

[04:58:18] <John_Ivan> mooff, I know of it, and I do :)
[04:58:53] <John_Ivan> mooff, but normally I interop when it comes to complex gui projects
[04:59:46] <John_Ivan> I mock the GUI in the most RAD possible framework (such as QTCreator, VCL, WinForms/WPF or NetBeans)
[05:00:13] <John_Ivan> mooff, and just open a pipe for it. Or hook the widgets to fork() calls which executes ruby or something else.
[05:00:31] <John_Ivan> mooff, it's not worth making GUI in other languages. it isn't mature enough.
[05:01:02] <John_Ivan> so I'd end up having a C# gui talking to or calling python scripts or C binaries
[05:01:20] <John_Ivan> or a Java gui calling... linux binaries

[19:07:08] <nakilon> I feel like I've found a bug _<> didn't fully localize if it yet but when you do ".map.with_index{ |(_, *), i| " the _ isn't shadowed but permanently overwrites the higher definition

[19:16:15] <ox1eef> nakilon: please provide a working example of the bug, i didn't quite get it 
[19:33:16] <nakilon> _ = 1
[19:33:17] <nakilon> [[2]].map.             tap{ p _ }.
[19:33:17] <nakilon> with_index{ |(_),| _ }.tap{ p _ }
[19:34:05] <nakilon> you'll see that _ became 2; either change |(_),|_ with |(x),|x or replace _ with x everywhere and the issue is gone
[19:34:38] <nakilon> or if you remove the (_) splatting; so I suppose the bug is there
[19:35:48] <nakilon> shorter example: _ = 1; [[2]].tap{ p _ }.map{ |(_)| _ }.tap{ p _ }
[19:35:52] <ox1eef> yeah, looks like a bug to me.
