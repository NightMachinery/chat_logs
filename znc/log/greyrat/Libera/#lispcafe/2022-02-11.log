[00:00:14] <shka> i shit you not, this is weirdly religious 
[00:00:53] <aeth> it's just like how predatory mobile games have at least one level of currency so you don't realize how much money you're spending
[00:01:16] <aeth> NFTs are just draining money from people who somehow made 100x returns in shitcoin gambling before they realize that they probably should've cashed it out to real cash
[00:01:50] <aeth> nobody would spend $100,000 on a procedurally generated avatar if they actually had to spend $100,000
[00:02:15] <aeth> but if you only put $1,000 into the system...
[00:02:41] <aeth> even $1k is too much for an avatar ofc
[00:02:49] <aeth> for $1k you could pay a professional artist to make actually good art for you
[00:06:27] <aeth> but, see, that $1k would be a cost while the $100,000 procedurally generated art is an "investment" that somehow is supposed to go up
[00:07:02] <shka> aeth: yes, because tech expensive
[00:07:32] <shka> it is like in the stock market, company branded "tech" is supposed to be worth 10x more
[00:07:43] <aeth> well, no, it's "growth"
[00:07:46] <aeth> look at what happened to FB/Meta
[00:07:53] <aeth> as soon as Meta stopped growing, it lost like 1/3 of its value
[00:08:01] <aeth> and they only narrowly missed grwoth
[00:08:03] <shka> it stopped growing a while back 
[00:08:03] <aeth> *growth
[00:08:12] <aeth> no, they actually went down in daily active users for the first time
[00:08:15] <shka> it actually started to shrink now
[00:08:32] <aeth> you're thinking second derivative, the growth in the growth.
[00:08:42] <aeth> now it's actually a negative first derivative
[00:08:50] <aeth> (iirc, it has been years since Calc 1)
[00:09:04] <shka> nah, they actually started to bleed out users
[00:09:27] <aeth> now, yes
[00:09:30] <shka> they were loosing users in the developed world before even
[00:09:37] <aeth> this was the first quarter they reported having lost (overall) users
[00:09:47] <shka> but it was balanced out by influx from the developing nations
[00:09:56] <aeth> yes, who aren't as lucrative for ads
[00:10:11] <shka> that's why i said that FB is shrinking now
[00:10:23] <shka> anyway, forget about FB, take uber
[00:10:54] <shka> it is company that is loosing money

[01:38:34] <gilberth> A positive thinking programming language?
[01:38:51] <hayley> Yes.
[01:39:50] <gilberth> Has it ever happened to you being accused of negative thinking by merely stating fact?
[01:40:20] <hayley> Seems so.
[01:40:48] <hayley> It indirectly happened because I pointed one of her friends to Don't Build Your Own Lisp, after they brought up one of the "funny" images in it.
[01:40:49] <hayley> s/it./that book./
[01:42:10] <gilberth> Which is funny as it's the negative thinking about or valuation of the matter at hand by the accuser being projected onto you.
[01:43:01] <hayley> I think I worked out my n-body woes. If I make the world a 3d array, of shape (X 1 3) for X bodies, I can then do a Cartesian product by reshaping to (1 X 3). Then I can compute distance as usual.
[01:43:31] <hayley> Maybe (3 X 1) and (3 1 X) if it reduces the first dimension, I forgot which one is reduced.
[01:44:16] <gilberth> You're so narrow minding as you always think in a box. ;)
[01:44:30] <gilberth> * minded
[01:45:34] <gilberth> Anyhow, when you are a bit aware, you could spot people projecting their own beliefs onto others.
[01:48:06] <hayley> With all due respect, it is a bit odd that the J wiki mentions "exceptionally good performance" for particular combinations. Not that compilers are perfect, but they should usually reshape many forms into a canonical form.
[01:48:27] <hayley> Though IIRC most APL systems just have nicely written tight loops, and still interpret.
[01:51:04] <hayley> I want to outperform some poorly written C code, but it is still poorly written. Like having code to handle returning NULL from functions that don't even need to return anything, as they only do side effects.
[01:51:17] <hayley> FWIW, the error handling is more or less abort() anyway.

[02:20:01] <semz> What I don't get is where they get the money from. Do they somehow attract new suckers?
[02:20:15] <aeth> Well, I mean, HL:A basically is HL3, they just made the decision to make the plot a prequel instead of making HL3 a VR-only game. So you can't really compare HL3 to DNF or Star Citizen anymore because they actually released a HL game with all of the work that started as work on HL3, they just chose not to continue the narrative directly (yet).
[02:20:16] <semz> Or do they have a hardcore cultist fanbase that just dumps grand after grand on the game

[03:05:46] <hayley> Not more than that description.
[03:07:06] <sm2n> In this context, it might help to rewrite your thoughts for a more general audience, with more familiar examples
[03:07:06] <hayley> All I can say is that computing augments its user, so limiting one to the "human scale" is a contradiction. But that leads to both possibilities of augmenting, or abandoning computing. Thus, I need to know why augmenting is a better option. I think I have written all I can on that.

[03:10:25] <hayley> One tricky thing is that, in software development, complexity is usually not desirable. But when I discuss social aspects of things, complexity is desirable. (I don't really buy the "necessary"-or-not complexity stuff for software, but let's roll with it.) Perhaps an analogy for unnecessary complexity in software is like bureaucracy, in that it is surely complicated, but it does not achieve much.
[03:12:03] <sm2n> I'm don't know if I agree — this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I think more bureaucracy than people expect has legitimate function
[03:12:19] <hayley> Fair enough.
[03:13:31] <hayley> There's always a reason for such things, and I'd guess more people are on the receiving end than not, where it doesn't look so good.
[03:14:14] <sm2n> In general, there's a tendency in complex systems to grow until everything is on fire and sucks
[03:14:36] <sm2n> If everything looks good, then people say "let's add capacity", and then suddenly everything is on fire

[03:36:31] <White_Flame> what's the/their working definition of "human scale" computing?
[03:51:29] <hayley> I can't really provide a definition, other than a vague sort of reaction which is related to a machine-oriented idea of "simplicity", with using less resources and using less code, at the cost of literally everything else.
[03:52:43] <hayley> ...and the idea is that a human cannot possibly comprehend something written in another way. idk.
[04:05:30] <White_Flame> ok, so it's not about a user, but about the programmer?
[04:06:27] <hayley> Sorta, but this really restricts the users of such software.
[04:06:48] <White_Flame> right, basically featureless programs
[04:06:58] <hayley> It's characterised by how software is made, sure, but it's more obviously disastrous to users.
[04:07:00] <White_Flame> that still pushes all the complexity of the problem away from the computer and onto the human
[04:07:14] <White_Flame> literally "don't use the computer as much"
[04:07:26] <hayley> Pretty much.
[04:07:59] <hayley> I'd also say something about modularity allowing for the maintenance of large programs, but I apparently failed to articulate that before. 
[04:13:17] <hayley> Someone told me that such and such protocol was only meant for one use, and that people who complained about it being feature incomplete didn't think to use other protocols. But I was complaining because there is nothing shared between such protocols, and thus no possibility for code reuse or whatever. The non-modular nature of those is a waste.
[04:18:06] <hayley> e.g. suppose one downloads stuff, and one uploads stuff. Download looks smth like C->S: request S->C: response header, data. Upload could just be C->S: request header, data S->C: response. But there is no way to share grammars between two of such protocols, unless one references the grammar of the other.

[06:21:58] <hayley> W =: 3 1 2 $ 1 0 0 _1 0 0 <newline> U =: 0 2 1 |: W <newline> W + U ⇒ length error
[06:22:34] <hayley> IIRC in Petalisp this would produce an array of shape (3 2 2).
[06:23:25] <moon-child> that seems somehwat insensible

[06:35:31] <moon-child> oh--given something like the W array from above, you want a list of distances between each pair of elements?
[06:35:56] <hayley> Yes.
[06:36:37] <hayley> ...well, a table makes more sense, one axis per body.
[06:37:06] <moon-child> I don't follow.  Maybe missing context
[06:37:43] <moon-child> what do the axes of W represent?
[06:38:27] <hayley> The first axis represents the dimension being considered (3d space, so x, y, z) and the second axis represents each element.
[06:39:40] <moon-child> then where does  2 2 $ 0 2 2 0  come from?
[06:39:51] <moon-child> there's only one distance, and it's %:2
[06:41:01] <hayley> It's 2 2 $ <distance between 1 0 0 and 1 0 0> <distance between 1 0 0 and _1 0 0)> <distance between _1 0 0 and 1 0 0> ...
[06:41:30] <moon-child> right

[06:43:48] <moon-child> I ran into a similar problem recently.  With a high-dimensional array, it's not always obvious which order the axes should go in, and rank doesn't always save you
[06:44:12] <moon-child> so you need &.|:, or in more extreme cases something like &.((m&|:)`a:)

[07:10:41] <hayley> Why trapezoids?
[07:11:25] <gilberth> Why not? It's fewer trapezoids than triangles and the other RENDER primitive.
[07:11:49] <hayley> Just wondering.
[07:12:44] <gilberth> What else do you suggest? There are only triangles and trapezoids. If RENDER could draw polygons, I wouldn't bother hacking this in in the first place.
[07:13:10] <hayley> I never used RENDER. That's my answer.
[07:13:45] <gilberth> And besides, you trivially get trapezoids from Bentley-Ottmann. Which you really need as polygons could be self-intersecting.

[07:15:57] <gilberth> My polygon clipper works the same way.
[07:19:04] <gilberth> I also guess that a rasterizer would be easier to do with trapezoids. As there are some guarantees here as that no two trapezoids overlap. If you define them closed but the lower edge, they don't even overlap at edges, and they are sorted from top-left to bottom right.

[09:11:19] <hayley> But I have to wonder why no optimistic/lazy stack allocation is used in any prevalent runtime. That paper was done with C♯, but the CLR doesn't do that. Nor JVM. Nor any Lisp implementation, or V8 or PyPy or etc.
[09:15:21] <moon-child> chicken?
[09:17:27] <hayley> CONS should not CONS part 1, not 2. Chicken does 2.
[09:17:55] <hayley> Chicken/part 2 misuses the C stack as a newspace, whereas part 1 uses an allocation stack as a stack.
[09:19:04] <gilberth> The RENDER extension implementation I face is buggy. The spec says that alpha values of abutting edges add to exactly one. Doesn't happen for me and you could spot the striped nature of the polygon drawn. Fail.
[09:20:23] <moon-child> have you considered just writing your own renderer?
[09:21:18] <gilberth> I am writing my own render. If you mean by render to send pixmaps across the wire, I won't do that.
[09:22:21] <moon-child> is it really so much better to triangular a curve and send _that_ over the wire?
[09:22:59] <moon-child> *triangulate
[09:23:07] <gilberth> This all is silly. And sure 1M pixels 24 bits each is worse than a triangle.
[09:24:18] <moon-child> not 1M.  For a curve, you can effectively do two rows with a trapezoid, or one row with a triangle
[09:24:21] <gilberth> Beside at the end of day, I hope that the GPU would do some of the work. Anyhow, I am persuing there wrong path here, X11 no longer is your API to the display server in practice. It's some C libraries.
[09:25:28] <moon-child> (so, back from n^2 to n)
[09:25:50] <gilberth> moon-child: Do you draw Beziers all day? I mainly draw rectangles, some polylines and polygons. And with pixelation, you have to send every pixel, not just only the vertexes.
[09:26:11] <moon-child> if I had to go over the network, I would define my own protocol for it
[09:26:20] <moon-child> rather than piggybacking on x
[09:27:15] <gilberth> My task is not to define a successor to X. Besides, do you really expect people to install an succ(X) display server to run CLIM?
[09:27:56] <gilberth> moon-child: You suggested to piggyback on X. Not me. I work with what is there.
[09:28:42] <moon-child> I expect people to run CLIM to run CLIM.  If, when I ask CLIM to run over the network, it uses its own protocol rather than X, what do I care?  It can still translate back to X locally
[09:29:23] <moon-child> so, what you lose is the ability to run clim on machine a and only X (not clim) on machine b.  I think that's pretty reasonable
[09:29:35] <gilberth> Congrats. I still hope to establish CLIM or Silica rather as the de facto standard GUI toolkit for Lisp with time.
[09:31:47] <gilberth> And therefor I see no reason to make it as difficult and as alien as possible to use CLIM. It should blend well with your native GUI rather. This is why I say, that mimicking Cairo is nice from a NIH perspective, but completely useless, when you could as well link to libcairo.
[09:32:31] <gilberth> You actually also want to link against libX11, too, if only for the keyboard.
[09:33:17] <gilberth> I may and perhaps will specify succ(X) in my next live.
[09:33:56] <moon-child> arcan?
[09:34:54] <gilberth> Does it render at the display server in a device-independent fashion?
[09:35:42] <moon-child> not yet.  Getting there
[09:37:08] <gilberth> So it's not designed for that. Ok. Wake me, if they figure it out.
[09:54:57] <gilberth> lol, when I round my coordinates to integers, it works. Why are coordinates passed in 16.16 fixed point format then, when I can't use that?
[09:56:15] <moon-child> the problem was bad alphas, right?  Probably server just has numerically unstability
[09:58:00] <gilberth> Perhaps. AMD's OpenGL drivers where like this, I don't know if they still are. However I now have to figure out whatever Cairo does. It does seem to work fine with Cairo. This is annoying.
[09:58:40] <moon-child> many gpus do not round properly, even though spec says they must
[09:58:42] <gilberth> But then, as I said, this is the wrong route anyway.
[09:59:33] <gilberth> moon-child: Doesn't help, Cairo with this X server can draw polygons fine, I can't because I somehow don't have the extact same triangulation algorithm.
[09:59:55] <moon-child> yeah, didn't mean to imply that was the problem; just relating a related anecdote
[09:59:59] <gilberth> Maybe Cario works around things? You never know.
[10:00:00] <moon-child> I doubt it's even using the gpu
[10:01:27] <gilberth> Well, I won't be so sure about that.
[10:01:54] * moon-child looks
[10:02:21] <gilberth> You read the X server sources?
[10:03:26] <moon-child> I hope to recover
[10:04:11] <gilberth> Reading the X server sources and hunting those RENDER requests is brave.
[10:04:51] <moon-child> eh, I think I have it
[10:04:58] <moon-child> but I have to trace the backend-specific drawing requests
[10:05:22] * moon-child spots a 'DamageRegionAppend'
[10:05:26] <moon-child> smells a lot like software rendering
[10:05:52] <gilberth> Anyhow this is like playing too clever SIGSEGV tricks. It doesn't help me to do rendering (triangulation) in Lisp. When I would just use libcairo, this will be fixed with time, even without me filing a bug report.
[10:06:36] <gilberth> There is a lot of software rendering in the X server. But I have no idea where acceleration places its hooks. It could be way further up the call chain.
[10:07:33] <moon-child> could be.  I doubt it, though.  This is called from the 'glamor' code
[10:07:43] <moon-child> and I think glamor was their new hardware-accelerated thing
[10:08:10] <gilberth> Doesn't this glamor live at the kernel?
[10:08:30] <moon-child> I don't think so

[10:37:01] <moon-child> implying that the client machine is trying to software rendering and send back pixmaps
[10:37:12] <moon-child> *to do
[10:38:16] <gilberth> Ok. For what it is worth. The Linux X server has the very same glitches as XQuartz. This points to a software renderer.
[10:39:33] <moon-child> I am not surprised.  There is nothing about opengl that is incompatible with networking, but the modern ecosystem that has built up around it makes such things hard
[10:39:49] <gilberth> moon-child: I logged into my home Linux machine over the internet and tried with XQuartz where it failed entirely. When I tried with a local Linux here in a VM it worked remotely.
[10:40:32] <moon-child> running in a vm, I would expect software rendering anyway
[10:41:11] <gilberth> moon-child: I once played Quake 3 over a 10Mbps LAN using GLX. Worked. In the olde days at the uni GLX over the LAN was the norm.
[10:42:16] <gilberth> moon-child: Also something I would not be so sure about. This Parallels and it goes some way to give the emulated OS access to HW acceleration.
[10:42:30] <moon-child> ah, ok
[10:43:20] <gilberth> It definitely works with Windows otherwise my games would be too slow. I never benched my Linux there.
[10:47:40] <gilberth> moon-child: glxinfo says: "glx vendor string: Parallels Inc"
[10:48:58] <moon-child> ok
[10:49:31] <moon-child> yeah, I know there is some work there, also with vmware, and qemu+virgl.  But I was not aware it had gotten to the point where things would Just Work
[10:50:31] <gilberth> They do with Parallels and as such it's worth the fee they charge for me.

[10:58:21] <moon-child> yes!
[10:59:44] <gilberth> I am a noob with those things. Would that be feasible? I am an old-timer used to HW just doing one thing fast and well: Triangles.
[10:59:57] <moon-child> (well, ok, you may wrap the bounding box with a triangle.  But 1) you don't have to do that if you use compute shaders, and 2) you may not want to do that anyway, if you are doing arbitrary domain transformations)
[11:00:26] <moon-child> gilberth: I think it is feasible, but no one does it for some reason
[11:01:39] <gilberth> Is there a reason besides "We always did it this way"? And would it be feasible for a mere perhaps fat line e.g.

[11:05:00] <moon-child> oh, for that I see no reason not to triangulate
[11:05:24] <gilberth> Even with round cap and joint shape?
[11:05:45] <moon-child> well, ok, not for that case
[11:06:46] <moon-child> (but, I would probably draw the rectangular part and the cap separately)
[11:07:57] <moon-child> round cap I assume is a circle?  That is easy.  (bezier is harder, but I can do paths, and when I get around to it I'll do strokes too)

[11:22:03] <moon-child> hmm, maybe this is alright

[23:11:22] <gilberth> Ok. Whoever wrote the RENDER spec was not sober while he wrote it. What they mean by a concave trapezoid and/or abut edges is that edges which are the same and directly follow each other in a list of trapezoids or triangles are rendered such that their alpha values add up to exactly one. Or something similar. You don't know. This contradicts the later statement that the order of triangles would be insignificant.
[23:12:08] <ck_> is it a concave trapezoid in vacuum?
[23:12:27] <ck_> also if they were not sober, they were doing the right thing. cheers.
[23:13:27] <gilberth> In my example <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/trapezoids.svg> I send the trapezoids in left to right top to bottom order which results into alpha glitches. When I reorder them such that abut edges are consecutive it works out fine.
[23:14:45] <ck_> "concave trapezoid" probably just means that the parallel edges are not oriented alike
[23:14:48] <gilberth> ck_: Perhaps. Anyhow, what they write is not what they do. You could guess and get a feeling of what they tried to say, but can't be sure. What definitely is false is that the order of triangles/trapezoids would not matter. It matters.
[23:18:33] <gilberth> Anyhow when I send by triangles such that they map out subpolygons without holes, it works. Notice that the top-right subpolygon is concave, but it still looks ok. But this won't be possible in the general case.
[23:19:49] <gilberth> E.g. with two holes, and thus two split vertexes. Like e.g. "8".
[23:24:00] <gilberth> And this is what I meant. The RENDER protocol spec is just a placebo, you should regard it as some internal unstable interface. The real and reliable interface is libcairo.

[23:33:39] <gilberth> However, I wonder what the implications are for polyline triangulation. Do I need to turn these into non-overlapping triagles? Perhaps using Bentley-Ottmann?
