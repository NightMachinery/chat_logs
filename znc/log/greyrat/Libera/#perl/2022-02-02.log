[00:53:24] <ozzzo_work> Can I depend on the array to be in (ping,fdns,rdns) order?

[00:54:59] <ozzzo_work> excellent, ty!
[00:56:09] <LeoNerd> Also, if you can install it I'd suggest installing Future::AsyncAwait, so you can use `await` expressions instead of ->get calls

[00:57:42] <simcop2387> didn't think it would

[00:59:34] <LeoNerd> Yah.. it's never really been a longterm goal for Object::Pad to do that, honestly. If it ever did become that stable I'd just move it into perl core

[01:01:44] <LeoNerd> Huuuge API changes
[01:02:06] <LeoNerd> To the point of complete re√Ømplementation. Object::Pad has been the experimental testground for the perl-visible *syntax* you'd write your .pm files in
[01:02:18] <LeoNerd> It has never intended to test the implementation. A core impl. would work totally differently
[01:03:35] <LeoNerd> So e.g. an object instance in Object::Pad is a blessed AV, because that's the best thing core currently gives it that it can work on. A true core impl. would create an entire new kind of SV that isn't an AV, HV, or whatever. 
[01:03:36] <simcop2387> i mean the user side interface of it all how that would all work
[01:04:23] <simcop2387> OV = Oy Vey
[01:04:27] <simcop2387> or is that Oi?
[01:04:54] <LeoNerd> It might be an OV, or I might consider that actually disks aren't so expensive these days that we have to compress things down to a single letter

[04:03:08] <aquanight> wouldn't it be OBJECT* obj = SvRV(POPs);

[04:05:54] <aquanight> well I'm assuming the idea is OBJECT is some new "SV type", similar to SVt_PVAV and such
[04:06:07] <LeoNerd> Yeah most likely
[04:06:20] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[04:06:23] <aquanight> like if I'm not mistaken, SvTYPE(sv) == SVt_PVAV means sv is actually an AV*
[04:06:36] <LeoNerd> Indeed
[04:06:43] <aquanight> so OV* would be the same way then
[04:06:53] <aquanight> SvTYPE(sv) == SVt_PVOV, (OV*)sv
[04:07:10] <LeoNerd> But should the new object system still require an interposed RV?
[04:07:24] <aquanight> but as far as perl variables go, if you're pulling from PADSV, GVSV, etc
[04:07:42] <aquanight> I think so
[04:07:45] <LeoNerd> This is far from certain
[04:07:53] <aquanight> "objects by vlaue" is a C++ thing and it's not necessarily a good thing
[04:08:04] <aquanight> at least
[04:08:14] <aquanight> as far as I know I've only ever seen "objects by value" in C++.
[04:08:40] <LeoNerd> SV* is already a pointer don't forget
[04:08:48] <aquanight> yes
[04:09:11] <aquanight> but you never deal with bare SV in the C land
[04:09:21] <aquanight> SV* is what perl code sees as values
[04:09:43] <aquanight> well no that's not really accurate
[04:10:03] <aquanight> hmm
[04:10:25] <aquanight> okay I look at it this way
[04:10:34] <aquanight> $x = $y; pp_sassign gets two SV*
[04:10:56] <aquanight> but it's not going to just SV* x, y; x = y; it does... some function I don't want to lookup right now.
[04:11:46] <aquanight> sv_setsv
[04:12:36] <aquanight> what I'm getting at ultimately is perl objects have generally been "by reference" objects and I see no reason to break that.
[04:12:50] <aquanight> OV* would just be an alternative to an AV*, HV*, or GV* with the SVf_OBJECT flag

[04:34:59] <aquanight> as it stands I'm imagining OBJECT* as basically just a specialized form of SVt_PVAV
[04:35:17] <aquanight> (like how PADs are AV*s)
[04:45:06] <xenu> i didn't spend more than 2 seconds thinking about it, but i believe if $foo = $bar isn't supposed to make a copy then $bar *must* be a reference
[04:48:02] <xenu> anyway i mostly expect the new OOP system to be a drop-in replacement for the old one

[05:56:55] <dg_dg> @gry, big lol. Thank you !
[05:57:22] <gry> you're welcome, i didn't do a lot there. i did seem to parse a bit of what you wrote before pasting it there. :)
[05:58:20] <dg_dg> yes, i forget to send eval command to the bot... so i can pass reference of subroutine to subroutine... good for lot of pattern. to use with.

[12:16:44] <Nataraj[m]> Hi, perl hackers! I need some help.
[12:16:44] <Nataraj[m]> There are a lot of json based REST APIs now days. And I guess there should be some kind wrapper that will allow to create perl interface to such API really fast. Does such wrapper exist? Or may be you can suggest a good implementation of perl interface to REST API, I can use as a reference while creating mine?

[18:50:17] <Grinnz> ozzzo_work: it's not blocking, you are waiting for it all to be done before checking the results. like i mentioned, if you want to handle results when they're done, you need to attach ->then to the individual ffutures, and that will return a new future; put that into the wait_all instead of the original future
[18:50:30] <Grinnz> in the ->then, do the handling you want to happen immediately when that future completes
[18:50:47] <Grinnz> or on_done

[19:53:33] <ozzzo_work> Grinnz: My 2nd-level routines for ping, fdns and rdns are only returning a value, and the only processing I'm doing is putting that value into a hash. The problem is that, when one VM times out for fDNS, that causes other VMs to report incorrect fDNS values, so it seems like CheckfDNS is blocking at line 472. Am I misunderstanding what is
[19:53:33] <ozzzo_work> happening?
[19:54:08] <gordonfish> IMHO, I never really felt like a separate rename (aside from prename which has regex and so fills that void nicely with regex no less) and mv. I tend to look at it like this: mv can move a file or dir to another directory, and with a new filename if one chooses (mv foo ../xyz/bar), or to the same directory with a new name filename (mv foo bar), so the difference is really the target directory, and thus is the same type of operation.
[19:54:55] <gordonfish> That said, an alias for rename using mv -T like someone mentioned would work just fine, but I prefer prename from File::Rename myself.
[19:55:04] <Grinnz> ozzzo_work: that's correct, event loops are not parallelism. a while loop will block everything else in that process

[19:59:48] <LeoNerd> async sub doathing() { while(1) { await Future::IO->sleep(10); } }   <== a nicely async loop with sleeps in it
[20:00:37] <ozzzo_work> ok I'll try that, ty!
[20:01:18] <LeoNerd> You -can- write the equivalent using Future::Utils::repeat but it ends up not looking anything like a regular perl while loop, so it's harder to glance at the code and get a feel for what it's doing
[20:01:23] *** Joins: eldritch_ (~eldritch@user/eldritch/x-9272577)
[20:01:50] <LeoNerd> The main "selling point" of async/await syntax is that code can be asynchronous but still end up looking like synchronous code; the same sorts of code shapes
[20:03:20] <Grinnz> await in an async sub is essentially a ->get in that it runs the event loop until that future is ready; but can be used in places where the loop is already running so you normally couldn't ->get

[22:59:13] <simcop2387> tm604: mine is mostly retraining some TTS and STT models, and maybe running GPT-2 style stuff.  the main reason for the P5000 is that it's better than the M6000, but a bit more expensive, and oddly the A5000 is a better price than the RTX 6000 24GB too (non A).
[22:59:40] <simcop2387> but i'll also likely start using them to run some Waifu 2x style stuff too against old cartoons

[23:00:18] <simcop2387> so really any of them will work for what i want.  i'm just mostly waffling about because of cost
[23:00:50] <simcop2387> the p5000 is in a "sweet" spot at just under $2k USD on ebay right now.  the A5000 24gb is at about 2.5k, and the m6000 is around 1k.
[23:01:14] <simcop2387> the RTX 6000 24gb is like 3-4k, around just below the A6000 48GB

[23:04:39] <PapaChub> Does anybody have any pros and cons for pushing out (in this case a Mojolicious app, but there's some SCSS and Webpack pre-processing for the front-end bits, as well) to staging/production servers via git `post-receive` hooks?  Do you prefer to track a particular *tag*?  Or *branch*?  Or `git push` to a different remote entirely?
[23:05:59] <simcop2387> i use branches for that kind of thing personally.  i'm not sure i'd use a post-receive hook anymore these days though, but maybe a webhook into some kind of CI pipeline to trigger it faster.
[23:06:57] <simcop2387> i keep meaning to look at setting https://www.drone.io/ up for doing that on my own servers from any git repo too

[23:18:47] <PapaChub> Yeah, we're not quite to a proper CI/CD pipeline yet; I'm just searching for a "Simplest Thing That Can Possibly Work" (or "If It's Stupid, But It Works, It Isn't Stupid") hack to let the other people on my team publish and review each other's changes without having to maintain up-to-date node/npm dependencies and whatnot on their own machines...

[23:22:10] <Botje> PapaChub: small Plack app that receives webhook pushes when somebody pushes to maain and does the pull && build dance?
[23:23:12] <Botje> PapaChub: and for reviews, just have a number of servers running that track a branch name named after them.
[23:23:27] <Botje> PapaChub: eg git push -f pr/12345:earth
[23:23:35] <Botje> and the server at 'earth' starts rebuilding the app.
[23:23:55] *** Quits: Nataraj (~Nataraj@91.203.188.92) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:24:06] <Botje> then you just need a simple system to avoid people stepping on each other's toes
[23:24:34] <Botje> but if the team is small enough you can get by with a simple chat channel
[23:25:05] <simcop2387> Botje: yea small app that does the work being triggered by webhooks is a good way to do it
[23:25:17] <Botje> of course that does not hold up in the face of build failures. up to you how to solve that :)
[23:25:51] <simcop2387> PapaChub: the biggest issue with doing it directly on server side is that it makes it hard to deal with permissions safely.  hitting a webapp that handles the permissions is nice and flexible and easier and simpler to manage.
[23:26:16] <simcop2387> esp if the worst the webapp can do is redeploy production again, which should be indempotent
[23:27:19] <Botje> (with just five minutes of extra work your build process can create a container that you then deploy instead of whatever is running now.)
[23:31:35] <PapaChub> I'm leery of the [outside] web server pulling from our internal network.  So I'm envisioning something internal that does the building/containerizing and "docker push"-ing to somebody in a DMZ.  And once there, `curl` a quick POST to production, triggering a pull/restart?

[23:32:44] <simcop2387> basically yes
[23:34:13] *** Joins: Darkcoal (~user@user/Darkcoal)
[23:38:37] <PapaChub> So when I `git push local-feature:qa`, is it still a post-receive hook that does "curl -X POST http://qa/pull-and-build" ?
[23:39:46] <Botje> that strongly depends on what git server is on the other side and whether it respects post-receive hooks.
[23:39:52] <simcop2387> depends on how you host your repos
[23:40:06] <simcop2387> gitea has a special setting for webhooks that i'd use instead
[23:40:32] <simcop2387> so does gitlab, github, bitbucket and others.  if you're using gitolite or similar then yea post-receive is the way to go

[23:41:24] <simcop2387> these days i prefer gitea myself, esp gitea + LDAP (also connects to AD) or other SSO provider

[23:42:20] <Botje> it's been a loooong time since I met someone running git-daemon
[23:43:43] <simcop2387> PapaChub: i'd start almost immediately looking at using gitea, it'll save you guys so much headache the moment you need to "do one more thing"

[23:44:28] <Botje> isn't gitea a single binary anyway?
[23:45:02] <Botje> I would compare it to gitlab but what a monster has that become ...
[23:45:47] <simcop2387> there's some config files and data files for it to serve up i thought too
[23:46:07] <simcop2387> and then the ssh part too i think, but that might be the same binary
[23:46:41] <PapaChub> If it's free and libre (or at least self-hostable) I'm easily convinced...
[23:49:00] <Botje> in the assumption you're doing this as part of $JOB: your time is worth a lot more than whatever hosted service you could use will ever cost
[23:49:53] <Botje> af $JOB[0], after I left the new teamlead spent three weeks implementing Jenkins on a physical machine to save costs on a CircleCI subscription.
[23:50:56] <simcop2387> PapaChub: it's all those things.  but yea as botje said sometimes the time cost is worth much more to the job than the cost of $5/user/mo.  but sometimes if it's a new company and you're in Ramen only mode then you can't afford that either.
[23:51:57] <simcop2387> the really nice thing about something like gitea though is that you get issue trackers on each project/repo, a wiki, and such.  so it might still be worth it even if it takes you a day or two to do it.  you can end up with a nice to manage central place for a lot of what you're planning
[23:52:46] <simcop2387> but before *ANY* of this.  CHECK YOUR FUCKING BACKUPS.  check them monthly.  they aren't working right now and you don't know it.
[23:53:10] <simcop2387> i've seen no backups, or bad backups, kill companies

[23:55:43] <PapaChub> We're a bunch of curmudgeonly luddites...  One guy only writes /bin/sh (POSIX-compliant) shell scripts ó†by which I mean "if [ "x$foo" = x ]" because he doesn't trust bash to be installed everywhere!
[23:56:22] <simcop2387> PapaChub: it isn't, FreeBSD doesn't come with it by default.  Even Ubuntu and Debian didn't include it by default for a bit.
[23:56:33] <PapaChub> And MacOS is switching to zsh, I know
[23:57:30] <simcop2387> the attitude is stupid and old but it's stuck around because the alternative really isn't.  though it's easy enough to go "no, just go install bash, i'm not going to deal with you otherwise"
[23:57:39] <PapaChub> But we *do* have Ansible baselines, so we *can* control our own infrastructure...
[23:58:33] <Botje> PapaChub: uh, dash (which _is_ strictly POSIX compliant) has -n and -z.
