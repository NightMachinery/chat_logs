[00:27:20] <guideX> why would jsonconvert.deserializejson be skipping some stuff
[00:28:02] <gufi> your not using properties? only has a getter? has ignore attributes? isnt serializable?
[00:28:18] <gufi> poorly formed json? lots of reasons
[00:28:32] <guideX> I am using only properties, it has both get/set, it was serialized BY jsonconvert
[00:29:08] <gufi> so you're doing something akin to serialize -> deserialize it back? and it fails?
[00:29:09] <guideX> var blogDetail = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Blog.DetailViewModel>(json); I use this, and I can see the missing thing in the json text, but still, it is null
[00:29:13] <guideX> yeah
[00:29:23] <guideX> I mean it mostly succeeds, but leaves two key things null
[00:29:34] <gufi> what is the prop type and the data in that field
[00:31:01] <guideX> this is the blank thing "public SingleBlogHolderModel Blog { get; set; }" and that class has the actual database model in it "public BlogModel Blog { get; set; }" and inside of that, has some simple int's strings, all properties
[00:31:17] <guideX> I suppose kinda confusing without the code
[00:31:29] <guideX> idk why it would leave it null and skip it, kinda weird\
[00:31:52] <gufi> does the blog object in the json match name of the property?
[00:32:41] <blez> does webview2 need Edge installed?
[00:32:58] <guideX> yeah.. I got { "Blog": { "Blog" { ... and then the actual things like ... "BlogID": 4, etc
[00:33:12] <guideX> maybe it's because I have two things called blogs there
[00:33:20] <guideX> same name, and it confuses it? (a guess)
[00:33:23] <gufi> doubt
[00:33:46] <gufi> does the main object have a property of an object that matches the shape of your json?
[00:33:50] <gufi> cause it sounds like it doesnt
[00:35:22] <guideX> hmm let me check that
[00:36:18] <guideX> ohhh
[00:36:20] <guideX> I know why...

[02:48:48] <moose> Slade: What kind of comment is that
[02:50:38] <Slade> 2 incorrectly constructed sentences
[02:51:17] <moose> I meant why is it important to clarify that they are "brown people"?
[02:51:55] <Slade> because people don't rage when I issue paperwork for europeans
[02:52:07] <moose> Who is raging though?
[02:52:17] <jonp> republicans, usually
[02:52:26] <moose> I don't follow. Are you referring to work things and people at your job are like "Why are you hiring all of these brown people?"
[02:52:45] <Slade> moose, really wasnt a comment targeted towards you. it's alright :)
[02:53:07] <moose> It was broadcast with no context to the channel, so I am just asking a clarifying question.
[02:53:22] <moose> I don't know why you are getting defensive.
[02:53:28] <Slade> several clarifying, and now we've moved onto huge amounts of backstory
[02:54:09] <moose> Well my initial impression was that you felt ousted by fellow racists, so at least we got far enough to avoid that being the assumption.
[02:54:38] <Slade> you're also jumping to lots of conclusions, and the ultimate payoff of clarifying it all really isnt worth it :)
[02:54:45] <ezio> lol there's this employment law show in my province in syndicate.  It's basically an advertisement, but people call in to get their questions answered.  Dude calls in about how they're forcing people back to work.  Calls in sarcastically because he doesn't understand the difference between federal and provincial and the province deals with all legislation related to employment and the federal government just won a Liberal minority.
[02:54:47] <ezio> Dude says
[02:55:04] <ezio> "I'm a voting liberal and what you're telling me is I have to go back to work?!"
[02:55:14] <jonp> "yes"
[02:55:29] <ezio> The lawyer quips right back, "The government of the province is Conservative."
[02:55:31] <ezio> looooool
[02:55:36] <moose> Slade: I didn't jump to a conclusion, I had an initial impression because of the ambiguity of your statement and sought clarification. In the absence of clarification, I have come to other conclusions than you might agree with.
[02:55:45] <ezio> Dude didn't even know what to say.
[02:55:48] <Slade> moose,  "Why are you hiring all of these brown people?" <-- jumping to conclusion
[02:55:50] <ezio> Though he had this sick burn.
[02:55:58] <ezio> thought*
[02:56:01] <moose> Slade: I asked if that was the sentiment of your fellow employees.
[02:56:16] <Slade> moose, "fellow employees" <-- jumping to conclusions
[02:56:34] <ezio> isn't affirmative action baked into the US and Canadian constitutions?
[02:56:42] <jonp> no
[02:57:06] <moose> Slade: You are trying to deviate from the original premise of my question which included asking if you were referring to a work thing.
[02:57:07] <ezio> It is in Canada, and I'm pretty sure that SCOTUS ruled on affirmative action.
[02:57:37] <jonp> a SCOTUS ruling means "they felt like it", or "it's not *unconstitutional* for congress to pass the law"
[02:57:39] <Slade> moose, the original statement was 'what kind of comment is that'. which i answered. anyhow, this conversation isnt useful. i'm bailing from it
[02:57:39] <moose> So again, in the absence of these details, I asked questions. You took issue with those questions and now are attacking what you're calling conclusions made in my questions.
[02:57:42] <jonp> that doesn't mean it's part of the constitution
[02:57:43] <moose> So really it's just kind of retarded.
[02:58:12] <ezio> right
[02:58:23] <ezio>  it's not unconstitutional to pass a law.
[02:58:40] <jonp> the passed law may be unconstitutional on its face
[02:58:43] <moose> ezio: But a law could be unconstitutional.
[02:58:53] <jonp> the "passing" may not be unconstitutional, but the *enforcement* would be
[02:59:04] <jonp> meaning the law itself is effectively unconstitutional
[02:59:10] <moose> The existence of the law may also be unconstitutional even if unenforced broadly.
[02:59:36] <ezio> but a law that ameliorates the conditions of underprivileged classes is not in itself unconstitutional simply because it ameliorates the conditions of underprivileged classes
[02:59:46] <jonp> the existence of the law may be unconstitutional AND enforced
[02:59:48] <Slade> the constitution actually says "Congress shall make no law that..."
[03:00:08] <moose> Correct.
[03:00:18] <jonp> ezio: you said "isn't affirmative action baked into the US and Canadian constitutions?
[03:00:23] *** Quits: jamea (~jamea@189.237.66.233) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[03:00:25] <jonp> to which my reply was "no"
[03:00:30] <jonp> it's *allowed* by the US constition
[03:00:38] <jonp> but it's not PART OF the US constitution
[03:01:00] <jonp> perhaps i'm using the wrong definition of "baked in"?
[03:01:16] <moose> It's actually not even a law really, it's a group of policy that is crafted around dozens of legal precedents ruled on in a variety of state and federal jurisdictions.
[03:01:19] <jonp> …unless you can show me an amendment which requires it?
[03:01:26] <ezio> jonp, it's specifically allowed though; right?
[03:01:34] <jonp> it's not specifically forbidden
[03:01:39] <moose> ezio: Not by the constitution, no.
[03:01:44] <Slade> there are arguments that affirmative action can in some cases violate the constitution
[03:01:45] <jonp> "affirmative action" was not a phrase in the 1790's
[03:01:47] <moose> It's not specifically allowed nor forbidden.
[03:02:01] <jonp> Slade: indeed
[03:08:38] <MizMahem> Well, it depends on the definition of "Affirmative Action" its a blanket term. Some forms are constitutional, some forms are perhaps not.
[03:09:05] <MizMahem> Oh, you already said that, carry on.
[03:09:12] <MizMahem> o7
[03:10:25] <moose> 7o
[03:12:10] <ezio> jonp, if it's not specifically forbidden it is explicitly allowed.  There will be a precedent for interpreting the constitution that says that's what the constitution means.
[03:12:31] <jonp> eh…no.
[03:12:35] <jonp> "it's complicated"
[03:13:11] <jonp> as moose hinted at, there is decades of jurisprudence which limits and expands the scopes of various pieces
[03:13:22] <jonp> sorry, *centuries* of jurisprudence
[03:13:28] <moose> It is extremely varied and there's tons of history.
[03:13:29] <jonp> some helps, some hurts, some is overturned, some isn't.
[03:13:33] <ezio> Slade, sure and there are arguments where clowns might shoot out of my ass.  but for a sufficiently similar case that comports with the ratio of SCOTUS decisions about affirmative action, it will be allowed and I shouldn't have to explain that things that are round go in round holes.
[03:13:47] <jonp> ezio: except we have a new SCOTUS
[03:13:58] <jonp> a new SCOTUS which just decided to basically ignore roe v. wade
[03:14:02] <jonp> "settled law for 50 years"
[03:14:05] <jonp> is no longer settled
[03:14:12] <ezio> jonp, sure and they are amenable to stare decisis
[03:14:24] *** Joins: N1N (~N1N@user/n1n)
[03:14:25] <jonp> so if they want to nuke "affirmative action", they will.
[03:14:35] <jonp> if they want to rephrase it so that it means "white people uber alles", they will
[03:14:46] <ezio> reinterpret it
[03:14:48] <jonp> nothing is black and white
[03:14:49] <ezio> not rephrase it
[03:14:52] <Slade> ezio, you're going about that the wrong way if you're invoking the "clouds shooting out of your ass" argument
[03:16:14] <ezio> and they can only do that if they violate stare decisis or if Elivs comes back and jerks off on the Statue of Liberty.  Right now, at this fucking time, the constitution says affirmative action is what the constitution meant and there is a very specific ....
[03:16:20] <ezio> strict
[03:16:27] <jonp> WHERE does the constitution say that?
[03:16:40] <jonp> or, where does it NOT say that?
[03:16:54] <ezio> SCOTUS says that's what it says.
[03:17:20] <jonp> and SCOTUS can change its mind, stare decisis be damned
[03:17:33] <jonp> again, roe v wade was just ignored out of existence by SCOTUS
[03:17:33] <ezio> strict scrutiny
[03:17:34] <ezio> that's it
[03:17:36] <Slade> where are we going with this?
[03:18:07] <ezio> jonp, it was reinterpreted.  1+1 existed before humans we just learned about it recently
[03:18:34] <Slade> jonp, btw, RvW wasnt ignored. everyone thinks it was abortion, but it was actually privacy. and thats been pretty well preserved
[03:18:52] <ezio> and the fact that there are affirmative action programs in place and passing constitutional muster proves what I say is true.
[03:18:56] <Slade> good scotus rule things along the narrowest margins in my opinion
[03:18:59] <jonp> uh huh.  4th amendment has been preserved?
[03:21:51] <ezio> right roe was not ignored
[03:22:05] <ezio> but I heard that it's coming up for a decision
[03:22:08] <ezio> a quick one
[03:22:30] <ezio> they skipped whatever your version of a high court is.
[03:24:52] <Slade> the Texas abortion laws wont be challenged in a way that interferes with RvW.
[03:26:15] <ezio> I hope by now they've learnt what a fucking mess they've made and do the right thing.
[03:26:31] <ezio> But Roe is on the table I think.  Decision expected in a week or so.
[03:26:35] <Slade> 'right thing' ?
[03:27:02] <ezio> Like ... This is causing an absurd situation and irrevocable harm.
[03:27:14] <ezio> I don't care how they justify it.
[03:27:15] <jonp> and i don't think they care
[03:27:23] <jonp> they're acting nakedly political
[03:27:35] <jonp> and then acting like "how DARE we say they're acting nakedly political?!"
[03:27:38] <Slade> the court interprets the law. the question at hand is simple.  does the government even have standing in this case
[03:27:58] <ezio> Well this is the moon, so ...
[03:28:20] <Slade> basically texas gave authority/rights to private citizens, the DOJ has to prove that giving that right is somehow illegal
[03:28:48] <ezio> I mean nakedly partisan on any other issues, expected.  This one thing I think they can't do because even they're worried about the political blowback.
[03:32:23] <Slade> the judges are expected to interpret it in regards to the law
[03:32:39] <Slade> the hope here is they do

[04:57:38] <AbleBacon> Suchiman, i figured it out.
[04:57:47] <MizMahem> Tripknotix that's a tuple, and deconstructing a tuple. It's a pattern I like to use when I can.
[04:57:52] <AbleBacon> i was able to get rid of "SharedHighlighted" completely
[04:58:41] <Tripknotix> so is an optional field names version of a tupple?
[04:58:56] <AbleBacon> my View "Highlighted" is two-way binded with my ViewModel "Highlighted". and then i did this before "InitializeComponent()":
[04:58:57] <AbleBacon> DependencyPropertyDescriptor dpd = DependencyPropertyDescriptor.FromProperty(IsMouseOverProperty, typeof(Connection));
[04:58:57] <AbleBacon>             dpd?.AddValueChanged(this, (object sender, EventArgs e) => { Highlighted = IsMouseOver; });

[05:34:02] <AbleBacon> i have 'ObservableCollection' "B" which is a subset of 'ObservableCollection' "A", but is not necessarily in the same order. how do i get the elements of "B" to be in the same order that they are in "A"?
[05:39:14] <teegee> .Sort()
[05:39:26] <AbleBacon> "A" is not neccessarily sorted, though
[05:39:32] <teegee> sort them both
[05:40:35] <AbleBacon> 'ObservableCollection' doesn't have a "Sort()" function
[05:41:38] <teegee> ah yeah I thought that might be the case. Then you can't rely on the items being in any particular order I think
[05:42:14] <teegee> or maybe you can
[05:43:35] <teegee> you can make your own class that derives from observableCollection and implement IComparable
[05:44:13] <teegee> or you can implement a "sort" algorithm yourself that does what you want
[05:44:14] <AbleBacon> :(
[05:46:16] <teegee> just iterate over A, if A.item in B remove it from the old and add it to a new collection. when you're done iterating add the remaining items form the old collection to the new one
[05:46:52] <teegee> or which ever way you want them ordered
[05:57:10] <teegee> https://dotnetfiddle.net/1UqWmq
[05:57:48] *** Joins: FlipFlop (~FlipFlop@user/fl1pfl0p)
[05:58:06] <DevJohnC> there are two options: you can either ensure you add items to B in the order they are stored in A, that order should be preserved; or you can make them sortable to achieve the desired order and sort both collections
[05:58:57] <teegee> oh, I did it the wrong way around
[06:02:27] <teegee> https://dotnetfiddle.net/jOrE0J
[06:03:41] <MizMahem> hmm, well you could make a... hmm... a no, not a dictionary, I suppose a list that is a tuple of item A's position and a reference/hash/some other way to check equality/identity of the items. And then you could use that list to transform item B. You could sort by it with some effort I guess, but honestly at that point just adding and removing the items sounds better.
[06:04:20] <MizMahem> or if the order has to be the same, perhaps both lists should actually look at some parent list that owns them both.
[06:04:55] <teegee> the requirements are a bit vague
[06:07:36] *** Quits: FlipFlop (~FlipFlop@user/fl1pfl0p) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[06:07:58] <MizMahem> actually thinking about it more, clearing the one list and adding the other items to it again is almost certainly going to be faster in basically all cases, unless the values are like giant value types.
[06:08:23] <MizMahem> that only requires one pass through, and sorting will require more.
[06:13:35] <MizMahem> in the particular case of an Observable collection you could subscribe to the `NotifyCollectionChanged` event to automate the matching if you want.
[06:19:45] <DevJohnC> MizMahem, it's an observablecollection so you can't garuantee that re-adding will be faster
[06:19:51] <DevJohnC> it could have side-effects on each add
[06:19:56] <MizMahem> fair
[06:20:14] <MizMahem> but, a sort would also have side-effects no?
[06:20:20] *** Quits: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy) (Quit: Meadow Fresh milk)
[06:20:28] <MizMahem> I can't recall if a move or swap triggers a CollectionChangedEvent or not.
[06:20:44] <gufi> shouldn't iirc
[06:20:47] <gufi> thats on add/remove
[06:22:53] <MizMahem> mmm, well the Event args has a "move" Action and references moves.
[06:23:31] <MizMahem> Though I do not know if `ObservableCollection` specifically acts on those. One might think that as a "Collection" it has no internal definition of order, but off hand I don't recall.
[06:24:04] <MizMahem> I seem to believe it does.
[06:26:30] <MizMahem> oh no, I'm confused. An `ICollection` does have a concept of order. I was thinking it didn't. I always find C# set type hierarchy confusing.
[06:26:56] <MizMahem> So yeah I'd expect it to fire on any item swaps you do during a sort, creating a lot more side-effects when going that route.
[06:27:16] <MizMahem> Though I also seem to recall there is a method to temporarily suppress the events if you want?
[06:29:16] <MizMahem> nope, I'm crazy.
[06:32:49] *** Quits: dre (~dre@120.156.30.159) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:33:04] <DevJohnC> if you sort you should get a single notification that the collection changed, probably a reset, but that depends on implementation
[06:33:48] <DevJohnC> you can't suppress notifications, you can suppress UI redraws
[06:34:34] <DevJohnC> which is an annoying layer issue if your updates to the collection are triggered from outside of UI interactions/the viewmodel
[06:39:04] <MizMahem> DevJohnC: how would that work? AFAIK there aren't any methods that are applicable for like a "bulk sort" type operation. So you'd be like doing a bunch of Move calls or whatever that would result in a bunch of events.
[06:39:49] <MizMahem> Isn't there another object shit, what is it... I hated using it but it felt necessary...
[06:40:32] <MizMahem> ah, `CollectionView` I think? For handling this kind of mess.
[06:40:57] <MizMahem> Letting the underlying list remain however, but letting it be sorted different ways in the view.
[06:41:03] <DevJohnC> ah yeah, I'm thinking of that I think

[12:48:21] <eurogos> yeah, but I need to migrate the actual data
[12:48:30] <BSaboia> eurogos, if you are doing that in pure SQL, you can create a temporary table that "translates" the current userId (probably Int32) to a Guid
[12:48:38] <MatthiasVance> Yeah or an extra column?
[12:48:39] <BSaboia> So you can "look up" and change it

[12:54:24] <eurogos> so 1) new column on user table to hold new guid 2) for each table of 100+ tables, remove FK 3) update column with guid 4) add new FK 5) remove old Id column on user table

[14:15:41] <irwiss> yeah it's like copy paste on steroids
[14:16:39] <biberu> solution: block access to both github and SO so that people think for themselves ^^
[14:17:06] <planetcall|work> I have never tried that Github Copilot but I don't think it is to replace anyone. It is more like coding assistant to help you type mundane stuff faster.
[14:17:19] <planetcall|work> I guess we all know that already here :)
[14:20:47] <jmer> planetcall|work: As long as we can't even describe properly to other humans what we want our software to do, I doubt we can make the machine understand it any better xD
[14:21:38] <planetcall|work> jmer, the purpose of any coding assistant tool is not to interpret requirement :)
[14:21:52] <sysRPL> so adding in a separate logic() method outside of render() makes writing graphical animated demos A) more complex B) slower
[14:21:53] <planetcall|work> Also, I feel requirement gathering is an exercise in itself which many people are not good at

[14:22:43] <planetcall|work> MatthiasVance, have you compared it with Resharper? Is it better?
[14:22:46] <sysRPL> but they way i've designed logic(), it makes the demo / simulation users might write more accurate
[14:22:56] <planetcall|work> I have relied on R# since the beginning of time.
[14:23:32] <sysRPL> also i've found that vsync on can really take performance if a demo runs at less than the refresh rate
[14:23:41] <jmer> I like resharper, but on this computer it makes VS so damn slow it's unusable

[14:25:51] <MatthiasVance> planetcall|work: This is just code completion on steroids, like that GitHub CoPilot thing

[15:01:14] <planetcall|work> jmer, use KeyVault in Azure or any cloud if you want. If not, use Bitwarden Send. If not, use https://onetimesecret.com but don't put any context. Only password.
[15:01:17] <jmer> unless it's generated automatically it's not something we use
[15:01:25] <MatthiasVance> it is
[15:01:33] <MatthiasVance> password manager like 1Password has it built-in

But I'm wondering perhaps non-callable ones make sense somehow too (they'll block the current thread, but maybe they still execute on another, and maybe that makes sense)
[15:09:42] <planetcall|work> Ask question why this approach is needed. There might be better ways to consume async code from a synchronous context.
[15:10:37] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Oh cool!

[15:16:38] <Nasp> planetcall|work:  Yeah it was mostly safari we had issues with
[15:16:41] <alguien> planetcall|work, if you mean the part that says "You should always wait [...] This is typically done by using the await keyword", please note that "Accessing the [(Value)Task.Run]'s get accessor blocks the calling thread until the asynchronous operation is complete; it is equivalent to calling the Wait method."
[15:16:43] <Nasp> I tried to remove some samesite cookie shit
[15:16:48] <MatthiasVance> I remember people filing Safari bugs when they used Safari on Windows .. 5 years after it was discontinued
[15:16:57] <Nasp> But aparently that was still needed because many people haven't updated their browsers in the last year and a half
[15:17:01] <MatthiasVance> Or actually our devs TESTING the product in that browser
[15:17:38] <planetcall|work> Blocking the current thread as a means to wait for a Task to complete can result in deadlocks and blocked context threads and can require more complex error-handling.

[21:23:49] <jamea77> c# i have a textbox with this text: \\127.0.0.1\ZDesignerTLP2844    when is saved to database i see: \127.0.0.1DesignerTLP2844   i do the update with: csysconfigimp1 = '" +  @eRutaImpresora1.Text +  "'   what i am doing wrong? thanks
[21:24:48] <jonp> jmer: please elaborate on "you have a textbox with that text"
[21:25:05] <jonp> is it via `textbox.Text = "\\127.0.0.1\ZDEsignerTLP2844"`?
[21:25:13] <jonp> or via human entry in the textbox?
[21:26:39] <jamea77> via human type text see

[21:28:15] <jonp> what are you doing for the DB insert?  does that require escaping `\`?

[21:54:08] <eurogos> MatthiasVance, I managed to get migrations to create that massive script I needed to change the userId from int to guid
[21:55:09] <eurogos> the next step i need to do is to physically change the userId value to a UUID, the question I have now is shuold I tinker with the migration to set onUpdate: ReferentialAction.Cascade on all the new FK?
[21:55:45] <eurogos> that would mean all I need to do is change the PK of the user and sqlserver would reflect the change in all the fk... (i think(

[22:08:54] <MatthiasVance> But it might be better to configure the context instead?
[22:09:37] <eurogos> i want to temporarily add this "onUpdate: ReferentialAction.Cascade" when it recreates the FK

[22:09:55] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[22:09:59] <MatthiasVance> then yes definitely
[22:10:03] <MatthiasVance> and test your migration of course
[22:10:37] <eurogos> question, should I revert this on update cascade after my data migration? or safe to leave in productions
[22:11:20] <eurogos> presume on update cascade != on delete cascade
[22:11:30] <MatthiasVance> I don't know
[22:11:36] <MatthiasVance> Triple check these things yourself, always
[22:12:12] <eurogos> yeah, I cant think of a realistic scenario when the pk of the user will ever change
[22:12:32] <MatthiasVance> I'd say if it's not in the configured dbcontext I would find it weird for it to be on the DB
[22:12:35] <MatthiasVance> why not clean it up afterwards
[22:12:54] <MatthiasVance> But of course not everything in DB is supported by EF Core anyway so ...
[22:18:39] <eurogos> agreed!
[22:19:12] <DevJohnC> is there some stupid easy way to make bluetooth earbuds change audio source, when paired with multiple devices, that I'm unaware of?
[22:19:35] <MatthiasVance> That would be great wouldn't it, you could force the device to connect to them
[22:19:56] <MatthiasVance> Like if you press "connect to device" on another device it will take over the connection
[22:20:23] <irwiss> DevJohnC: you need to buy ones with 'multipoint' in feature list
[22:20:43] <MatthiasVance> he already said they are paired with multiple devices
[22:20:48] <MatthiasVance> so not multipoint of course
[22:21:07] <DevJohnC> I actually don't have a pair yet, I'm in the market for me and my wife
[22:21:13] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[22:21:21] <irwiss> if they're paired then just turn off the current source, it'll switch to the other
[22:21:28] <DevJohnC> and I want my wife, esepcially, to be capable of using them for her phone, computer and the TV without tech support
[22:21:40] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Are they all iDevices by chance? :P
[22:21:41] <DevJohnC> irwiss, just turn off your phone?
[22:21:46] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, nope
[22:23:13] <irwiss> i mean, turn off phone bt :P
[22:23:58] <DevJohnC> so the vibe I'm getting is this isn't a solved problem
[22:24:53] <irwiss> probs, personally i prefer proper comfy wireless headphones for pc especially for long calls, earbuds suck and i got no mobility requirement when on my pc
[22:25:06] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: As irwiss said there are multipoint thingies that can be simultaneously to multiple sources and will just take whatever source is playing, right
[22:25:16] <MatthiasVance> But I don't know much about those
[22:25:36] <DevJohnC> yeah that doesn't sound like what I'm after
[22:25:58] <irwiss> fwiw none of the multipoint i seen actually had a 'switch stream' button, they either switched when they connected to new device(like walk to car - they connect to car) or switched when you turned off the old one
[22:26:22] <irwiss> bluetooth as a tech is stuck in the 00ies still
[22:26:43] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: What I usually do when using airpods for example connected to regular BT devices is tell the device (PC) to connect to it
[22:26:56] <MatthiasVance> And you can do that with every source you have provided your wife grasps that
[22:27:53] <DevJohnC> yeah; it's not a great solution, my wife is tech savvy enough to grasp the concept but gets overwhelmed at all the tech stuff she needs to remember just to use a TV and whatnot
[22:28:09] <MatthiasVance> ahh okay then I don't know of any better solution
[22:28:15] <MatthiasVance> I have one
[22:28:22] <MatthiasVance> buy three headsets!
[22:28:25] <MatthiasVance> label them
[22:28:29] <MatthiasVance> :D
[22:28:31] <MatthiasVance> foolproof!
[22:28:45] <DevJohnC> like, sometimes the soundbar will bug out and she doesn't know how to get ARC going again, plus what's chromecast vs. what's the smart tv, how to even select an HDMI source and now this earbud thing, yikes
[22:28:51] <DevJohnC> it's frustrating over-complicated
[22:29:42] <MatthiasVance> that's exactly the reason why I bought an Apple TV
[22:30:39] <MatthiasVance> and got rid of all complicated audio setups

[23:23:37] <jonp> hm…
[23:23:54] <blez> anyway, it seems .NET 4.6 is the lowest for Win10 (1507, the first one) and on
[23:24:10] <blez> is .NET 4.8 backward compatible with .NET 4.6?
[23:24:37] <gufi> if you target 4.6 it will run under 4.8
[23:24:42] <blez> aha

[23:25:11] <Cecen> Yeah, I think I need to use when. Kind of weird/unexpected
[23:25:15] <gufi> in theory targeting 4.8 would also run under 4.6 assuming you didnt use any features from 4.7+
