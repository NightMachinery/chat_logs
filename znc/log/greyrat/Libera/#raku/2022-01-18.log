[00:25:41] <younder> 'zef install rakudoc' failed.. I needed 'zef -v install https://github.com/Raku/rakudoc.git'
[00:26:53] <El_Che> that looks related to the module itself
[00:28:08] <MasterDuke> istr rakudoc is known not to install cleanly right now, i think it doesn't pass all its tests, so you have to do something like `zef install --/test rakudoc`

[03:56:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone know offhand how I can figure out which version of vim started supporting "raku" for the filetype?
[04:00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> actually, more specifically, when they dropped support for perl6 fitetypes
[04:00:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what does it mean that it's supported? 👀
[04:01:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> well, here's the issue:
[04:02:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> https://github.com/kbucheli/p6-Text-VimColour/blob/master/t/vim_colour.t
[04:02:37] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> test 7 fails with the newest versions of vim
[04:02:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> if I change it to raku, it works with newer versions
[04:03:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so need to figure out when to set it to perl6 for ancient versions of vim and when to set it to raku for newer versions of vim
[04:04:40] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> sorry, test 4 fails
[04:06:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> tests pass with version 8.2.3489 but fail with 8.2.4100

[16:46:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat I have a follow-up question related to using `BEGIN`. I have a package Stoichiometry computations, which has a Singleton pattern class for accessing the chemical elements data. The package uses this declarations / instantiations within a few files : `my Chemistry::Stoichiometry::ResourceAccess $resources.instance;` .
[16:47:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> If replace one of them with `BEGIN` block, e.g. `my Chemistry::Stoichiometry::ResourceAccess $resources :=  BEGIN { my Chemistry::Stoichiometry::ResourceAccess $resources.instance }` this should be sufficient to speed the load at run time, after package installation?
[16:50:51] <lizmat> you're creating a constant from a variable that hasn't been initialized yet ?
[16:51:21] <lizmat> perhaps a gist with a golf ?

[17:03:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Not sure what you mean by “pass”. If I have just a 2 year old version of vim, it may not work with “raku”. If I have a new version of it’s broken with perl6.
[17:05:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Seems some kind of logic is needed to determine what language is supported.

[18:48:10] <Ulti> out of curiosity the ARM64 builds of MoarVM and Rakudo without any JIT?
[18:49:12] <Ulti> just noticing my benchmarks are a little bit faster than my intel laptop from 2016 on the latest Apple Silicon Mac but wondered if thats just its brute improvement in CPU power accounting for the lack of any JIT implementation
[18:51:02] <Ulti> D5n9sMatrix feels like an emerging AI child attempted to talk to us about its creation
[18:51:52] <MasterDuke> correct, they are without a jit. however, almost all of the moarvm/nqp/rakudo optimizations recently haven't been jit-related, so a recent rakudo without a jit is comparatively less slow than an old rakudo without a jit

[21:08:49] <cognominal> Is there in raku a canonical way to test if a file is binary (non textual file), like -B (I think) for Perl ?

[21:14:20] <Voldenet> perl's -B is not that useful

[21:19:02] <[Coke]> many of the file operators exist, but not b.
[21:20:02] <[Coke]> there is https://github.com/jnthn/p6-data-textorbinary
[21:20:36] <[Coke]> It's 5 years unchanged, but looks decent.
[21:21:31] <moon-child> 'The algorithm will flag a file as binary if it encounters a NULL byte or a lone carriage return (\r)'  didn't an old version of macos use lone cr as a newline?
[21:23:45] <[Coke]> pre OS X, IIRC.
[21:26:01] <El_Che> [Coke]: Mac Classic what they call it nowadays
[21:26:03] <El_Che> :)
[21:27:28] <[Coke]> +1

[21:52:54] <cognominal> Thx. Judging by the contributors, it is a good candidate
[22:06:00] <Voldenet> not sure why p6-data-textorbinary checks 13 and 10 separately
[22:07:16] <Voldenet> file(1) treats 10 and 13 as text always
[22:08:00] <moon-child> it says it's based on git's heuristic

[22:57:56] <moon-child> younder: consider using Terminal::Print, unless you absolutely need curses
[23:15:52] <Voldenet> a propos console libs, I wish there was something like https://github.com/Textualize/rich for raku
[23:16:23] <Voldenet> currently i just use Inline::Python for it, but it's enormously ugly

[23:55:27] <Voldenet> both
[23:57:04] <Voldenet> for example progress bar from rich uses `with` syntax, which translated into raku with __enter__ and __exit__ methods is a terrible hack
