[00:05:44] <nomagno> <The National Semiconductor 81LS95 multiplexer is needed for the high memory speed. Furber recalled that competitors came to Acorn offering to replace the component with their own, but "none of them worked. And we never knew why. Which of course means we didn't know why the National Semiconductor one did work correctly. And a million and a half BBC Micros later it was still working and I still didn't know why". Another mystery was the 6502's
[00:05:44] <nomagno> data bus. The prototype BBC Micro exceeded the CPU's specifications, causing it to fail. The designers found that putting a finger on a certain place on the motherboard caused the prototype to work. Acorn put a resistor pack across the data bus, which Furber described as "'the engineer's finger' and again, we have no idea why it's necessary, and a million and a half machines later it's still working, so nobody asked any questions".[10]>

[04:05:43] <InPhase> tomathy: NFTs are just blockchain graffiti.  They don't prove anything at all without external confirmation.
[04:05:58] <InPhase> I can try to create an NFT right now declaring I own google.com
[04:06:04] <InPhase> I still won't own it.
[04:06:08] <cation> if anything, it sounds like whoever creates an NFT out of something first can claim it as theirs (but even then)

[04:08:04] <[itchyjunk]> you can have distributed ledgers with no trust systems.
[04:08:28] <[itchyjunk]> You don't need authority for that, you need trust.
[04:08:34] <tomathy> that's complicated, maybe you do own it, or are in the process of owning it, perhaps your faith becomes real
[04:08:46] <[itchyjunk]> If the authenticating system uses that as a source of trust and can verify the ownership, then that's that.
[04:08:53] <tomathy> but unlikely
[04:08:57] <[itchyjunk]> tomathy, the issue there is "what is owned?"
[04:09:03] <[itchyjunk]> rather than "do you own it?"
[04:09:21] <[itchyjunk]> "do you own it?" is a common language interpretation of the legal lingo of "what is owned?"
[04:09:38] <[itchyjunk]> sounds similar but one can be casted as a jurisprudence issue and one cannot.
[04:09:58] <tomathy> ultimately i think InPhase is right, all this blockchain NFT stuff are jusst ways to pretend there's no authority, but giving all the authority to techies and computers

[04:12:44] <InPhase> Well there should be no need to consider legal systems if no authorities are needed, right?

[04:13:00] <[itchyjunk]> The person to whom a domain is registered might not be the "owner" of the domain legally.

[05:15:29] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: The mathematical basis behind a OTP is that without the pad, you cannot compromise it.

[05:15:41] <[itchyjunk]> Given "random key".
[05:15:44] <moose> And if you want to bring in theoretical possibilities, like future developments, you have to consider all possible future developments.
[05:15:53] <[itchyjunk]> information entropy is baked into the definition of a OTP.
[05:16:30] <[itchyjunk]> There is corrospondence of Shannon with some other mathematician i don't remember discussing this very thing.
[05:16:58] <moose> InPhase: And as far as OTP goes, it's only secure given certain constraints. Theoretically, it's ideal. But during the final moments of heat death of the universe, we will fail to have sufficient entropy to generate a secure key stream and necessarily weaken it.
[05:17:02] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: The only real requirement from "randomness" is that the sequence be something the assailant cannot determine.
[05:17:24] <[itchyjunk]> No, the real requirement for proof of OTP is "random key".
[05:17:34] <[itchyjunk]> They proof fails without that.
[05:17:45] <moose> So it's only secure to a certain point, which means it's not provably hard. It's only assumed that it's hard if we have a truly random key stream, which is constrained by the quality of randomness in the universe.
[05:17:57] <moose> Based entirely on conjecture too :)
[05:18:08] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: It requires it to be something the assailant cannot determine.  It takes only a minute of thought to confirm this.  Give it a go.
[05:18:19] <[itchyjunk]> moose, exactly my point
[05:18:24] <hans> i think boobs are great
[05:18:26] <moose> [itchyjunk]: Not really.

[05:19:29] <moose> I will opt out now since nobody wants to talk about the real theoretical physics aspects of the limitations in cryptography lol
[05:19:30] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Between when I encouraged you to actually take a minute to think about what I was saying instead of reflexively arguing to argue.
[05:19:34] <[itchyjunk]> moose, point taken
[05:19:36] <InPhase> , and replying
[05:20:36] <phogg> I am not nearly drunk enough to talk about theoretical physics.
[05:20:47] <[itchyjunk]> what about applied physics?
[05:22:39] <InPhase> moose: So if you do something simple, like use thermal fluctuations in a processor as a randomness source, it actually doesn't take very long for your processor's state to entangle with the entire planet, and then also the sun, and then also star systems across the universe that are shining light down on the Earth.
[05:23:33] <InPhase> moose: Therefore, using thermal fluctuations in a processor as a randomness source acquires randomness from a system that cannot be reversed without unwinding entropy in the universe, which requires you to have another universe on hand to obey the laws of thermodynamics.

[05:25:48] <InPhase> moose: It is therefore very trivial to get an unknowable random sequence of numbers that the laws of physics do not allow you to unwind, because of thermodynamics, which is itself based on statistical mechanics, which is basically a physical formulation of information theory.

[06:10:54] <MsSmith> I believe if we had a 100% comprehensive type for integer for example you could easily program a function that solves the halting problem because by definition, you would know everything about type integer

[06:11:10] <MsSmith> the fact that we have incomplete types in type theory is a problem

[06:44:03] <oldlaptop> Usually, nowadays, "porting" refers to making relatively minor changes to a program so it copes with differences in the environment - for example, something like a Python interpreter can (and CPython definitely does) act differently on different operating systems in some ways, and programs (sometimes) have to be written carefully to avoid assuming things about OS-specific behavior.
[06:44:26] <oldlaptop> At one time, "porting" a program from one computer to another meant more or less rewriting it by hand.

[06:44:51] <tomathy> it would still mean that if anyone else bothered to make CPUs

[06:58:08] <moose> So imagine you have an if statement, which is a branch.
[06:58:22] <oldlaptop> On this (fantastic) graph, the mitigation for "Meltdown" takes the penalty for "Kernel call" and turns it into a penalty more like the ones for "Thread context switch" (and more like the bottom one than the "direct costs" one): http://ithare.com/infographics-operation-costs-in-cpu-clock-cycles/
[06:58:23] <bayaz> Title: Infographics: Operation Costs in CPU Clock Cycles - IT Hare on Soft.ware 
[06:58:24] <[itchyjunk]> ok
[06:58:49] <moose> Maybe your if statements checks if the length of the supplied data is equal to the length of the target data... like a private key or something secret.
[06:59:03] <moose> Then inside the if statement, if it's true, it does a 1:1 comparison in a loop or something.
[06:59:15] <moose> Outside of the if statement, it just returns false as to say your comparison isn't the same
[06:59:25] <moose> This is common in string comparison stuff.
[06:59:33] <[itchyjunk]> so far,so good
[06:59:49] <moose> Before the result if the if statement is actually figured out, the processor has speculatively executed both sides of the if statement. The true and false conditions both.
[07:00:17] <moose> That means the contents of your secret string are in a cache at that point. L1D/L2D/LFD
[07:00:49] <moose> So even if you provide the wrong length, you now have that data in a cache and can test the presence of values in the cache and iterate it, discovering the string remotely.
[07:00:55] <[itchyjunk]> why the speculative part? this is to speed up access once the code has run?
[07:00:59] <moose> Yep.
[07:01:19] <signup> ciao
[07:01:20] <moose> It basically executes the inner code just in case the if statement is true, it's decided based on a lot of weights and factors.
[07:01:22] *** Quits: signup (~conjo@103.107.197.44) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:01:51] <moose> If you have a long running process that frequently sees that if statement executed, the CPU is primed to speculatively execute it
[07:01:57] <[itchyjunk]> and this particular optimization was used by different manufacturers? or just intel?
[07:02:04] <moose> Everyone basically.
[07:02:09] <[itchyjunk]> :o
[07:02:29] <moose> The fun part is when you have things that your process doesn't own.
[07:02:43] <moose> And you execute this vulnerability against a more core service.
[07:02:44] <[itchyjunk]> even if it did pre load the secret in some cache, mechanisms should prevent "other" programms from accesing it?
[07:02:53] <moose> It's not about other programs.
[07:03:04] <moose> It's about once the data is cached, it's faster to access.
[07:03:15] <moose> And so then you can abuse timing attacks for data retrieval.
[07:04:02] <moose> You can also do things like... read program memory with a buffer overrun, speculatively. So even if the code isn't vulnerable to a buffer overflow, you can read beyond the buffer of say an array or any indexed pointer really.
[07:05:03] <moose> This is especially important when you have systems that accept arbitrary code or do something specific, say JavaScript running on a web browser.
[07:05:36] <moose> You know how you have LastPass or any password manager in your browser as a plugin, or your cached session token for some web banking thing? Yeah, they can read that.
[07:06:58] <[itchyjunk]> What is it that can do the reading? if i am running something to exploit this pre caching thing, i can ask the cpu to check if the hashes match, then do things with the pre cached hash that the cpu puts there?
[07:07:39] <[itchyjunk]> so my program still would need a way to access the web browsers storage and such, no?
[07:07:41] <moose> A website executing JavaScript on your machine can evaluate arbitrary regions of memory.
[07:07:47] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[07:08:04] <moose> So say you go to any website and have JS enabled and are Spectre vulnerable, you are at risk
[07:08:44] <flakland> probably why the performance is so neglected on youtube
[07:08:50] <[itchyjunk]> I guess i don't understand why it can evaluate arbitrary regions of memory. i would think that programs are somehow sandboxed and can't see outside of their box
[07:09:13] <moose> Your web browser is one program.
[07:09:17] <moose> Each tab is part of that program.
[07:09:22] <moose> Your plugins are part of that, too.
[07:09:50] <[itchyjunk]> ah, things within the browser sandbox is a fair game for some malicious code in one of the tabs

[07:29:17] <flakland> maybe lol
[07:29:43] <moose> But is it difficult? No. It's quite simple. The reason they pay us a lot is because security generally has a crazy budget at big companies.
[07:29:43] <oldlaptop> Rather less of it is going into rent in, oh, south Florida than the San Francisco area.
[07:29:51] <sonny> is it really 230k or is that part of the compensation?

[07:31:15] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: I'm thinking of family practice
[07:31:26] <oldlaptop> sonny: Computers on spacecraft have to be able to deal with a lot more ionizing radiation, because there isn't Earth's magnetic field between them and the harsh universe.
[07:31:44] <sonny> oh, right
[07:31:51] <moose> oldlaptop: And also the lack of other matter stopping alpha particles from interfering with things.
[07:31:56] <oldlaptop> The special radiation-hardened CPUs have tended to be PPC, for whatever reason
[07:32:08] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, some of those docs at family practices make a bit more because they are part owner
[07:32:19] <[itchyjunk]> new doctors in those practices make ~$100k around here i think
[07:32:28] <moose> Depends on area of expertise, [itchyjunk] 
[07:32:34] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: I heard it was because of how the pay staff etc
[07:32:40] <sonny> maybe we just said the same thing
[07:32:41] <oldlaptop> moose: I was about to ask if alpha particles sailing around really are that big in the cosmic background, but gosh, they probably bring enough of that with them to worry about

[09:00:04] <[itchyjunk]> i wrote a crawler in php once then added an email filter
[09:00:10] <Gallomimia> out of all the different things that you can do on the internet that are "bad" email spam is probably the one most clamped down on severely and swiftly. you'll get added to blacklists and firewalls all over the place, and your ISP might even cut you off
[09:00:16] <[itchyjunk]> i think it found few million email in ~3 days
[09:00:46] <[itchyjunk]> email spam died thanks to a large part to machine learning.
[09:00:49] <sonny> spammers suck
[09:00:53] <[itchyjunk]> Google and friends have written a lot about it.
[09:01:07] <mishugana> the greatest evil in my opinions are ads .. I fucking hate them. On the desktop, we can at least block most of them, but on mobile... >:
[09:01:24] <mishugana> Google is Satan incarnate
[09:01:32] <mishugana> Heh

[09:04:17] <mishugana> Studies by whom exactly?
[09:04:22] <mishugana> I don't buy it
[09:04:24] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, okay, $0.002 per page you visit.
[09:04:31] <Gallomimia> you want a server that hosts a website, even a cheap one? costs money.
[09:04:33] <[itchyjunk]> You can look up access cost studies.
[09:04:47] <mishugana> That's what I'm saying - anybody can sponsor studies
[09:04:54] <[itchyjunk]> Data costs alone would mean a lot of "free website" would disappear.
[09:05:02] <mishugana> In fact, quite a lot of studies are sponsored by precisely those companies engaging in it
[09:05:06] <[itchyjunk]> Now you're saying studies are fake because it's sponsered.
[09:05:13] <mishugana> Yes
[09:05:21] <[itchyjunk]> At that point, all of science is fake and there is no longer a need to discuss anything.
[09:05:36] <mishugana> That's a ridiculous extrapolation
[09:05:39] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: honestly, the kind of sites which do get paid by ads are the kinds of sites I wouldn't visit anyway, even with adblock :)
[09:05:40] <[itchyjunk]> No, it's not.
[09:05:47] <[itchyjunk]> All studies are sponsered by someone.
[09:06:00] <[itchyjunk]> If sponsership itself dismisses the conctent, then all studies become pointless.
[09:06:10] <mishugana> For instance, there are "studies" by NGOs directly sponsored by the U.S Dept of Defence that puts interesting twists on HR violations... 
[09:06:13] <[itchyjunk]> And without studies, all of science is pointless.
[09:06:26] <deniska> maybe youtube I still visit?
[09:06:27] <mishugana> My point is that blanket statements like "studies have shown..." are meaningless
[09:06:34] <[itchyjunk]> I don't think figuring out running websites costs money is that crazy of an idea.

[09:07:59] <[itchyjunk]> "doesn't cost much to run"

[09:08:59] <sonny> I don't get it
[09:09:00] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, US gov made internet public at some point.
[09:09:10] <sonny> you have to get internet froma provider
[09:09:14] <[itchyjunk]> you pay ISP money to user their infrastructure.
[09:09:15] <mishugana> There is no justification for a site to show countless ads, collect user information, track user across sites, have content creators put in extra paid sponsorship details, and yet claim that "we need money to eat"
[09:09:16] <rindolf> yitz: i'm glad! i'm a sadist
[09:09:20] <[itchyjunk]> Internet itself is free.
[09:09:22] <Gallomimia> what if ISPs would suddenly cut off any customer who had a ddos participating bot on their network?
[09:09:22] <mishugana> That's patently nonsense
[09:09:28] <yitz> rindolf: that's good to know 
[09:09:29] <[itchyjunk]> There absolutely is justification to show ads.

[09:10:03] <mishugana> [itchyjunk]: Okay, I'm done with the ad hominem attacks, let's stop this discussion here

[09:10:13] <[itchyjunk]> You can stop any time you want.

[09:10:28] <Gallomimia> poof. call tech support or your shit is not getting turned back on
[09:10:29] <[itchyjunk]> I've also no said anything about you, so there is no ad hominem here.
[09:10:29] <yitz> rindolf: I'm not a masochist
[09:10:40] <sonny> Gallomimia: that sounds terrible
[09:10:49] <Gallomimia> i don't care.
[09:10:53] <sonny> ddos would probably come from your fridge
[09:10:54] <mishugana> Just saying that I used to live in a time when the web was in its nascent state, and none of these problems prevented a flourishing web - personal or business
[09:10:54] <yBtNJW3j> The cost of some things is very cheap--even puppylinux has free blogging software.  As for those who need to get paid to run their server, ads probably do not cover the cost for most.
[09:10:56] <deniska> Gallomimia: it's kinda hard to detect ddos, typically it takes receiving a complaint from a ddos victim
[09:11:03] <sonny> what is mom gonna say to the ISP?
[09:11:06] <Gallomimia> keep your network safe or get rid of it

[09:11:28] <[itchyjunk]> Without the ads subsidizing the internet, this would not have been true.
[09:11:39] <[itchyjunk]> Shit like gmail is free because it's ad subsidized.
[09:11:43] <sonny> no, shes gonna be pissed that she can't do work or go shopping

[09:12:10] <Gallomimia> now [itchyjunk] i know the internet is not "free" because even welfare won't offer to give you money to pay your internet bill. in spite of requiring you to use the internet to apply for said welfare
[09:12:26] <mishugana> Yes, gmail, which actually scans your email and justifies it by saying that it's by a program, not by people, and so it's absolutely fine :|
[09:12:27] <Gallomimia> sonny, seriously. take your fridge off the fucking network, or get it secured.

[09:13:15] <sonny> lets use terms cause the internet covers too much
[09:13:15] <[itchyjunk]> Gallomimia, but that would mean government paying for the internet
[09:13:19] <Gallomimia> not without a fucking vax
[09:13:20] <[itchyjunk]> which means more taxes
[09:13:25] <[itchyjunk]> making it essentially not free
[09:13:44] <sonny> pay my isp == pay for internet
[09:13:57] <[itchyjunk]> pay for access to the internet
[09:14:05] <sonny> web services may be free* or not
[09:14:18] <amigojapan> Didn't the UN just say internet was a human right?
[09:14:27] <[itchyjunk]> UN says a a lot of thing
[09:14:31] <rindolf> some 'people' are proud of writing in bad grammar
[09:14:34] <[itchyjunk]> most of it doesn't mean much
[09:14:53] <mishugana> djokovic has been cleared to play in the AU Open ... all things considered, I think that's good
[09:14:58] <Gallomimia> http://www.craphound.com/littlebrother/download here is a story book in which there is an ISP which includes a subscription to download for free, independent music linked to that ISP's owner's band. i suggest you all read it

[09:15:15] <[itchyjunk]> Take google search, for example. It's very hard to compete with an ad free model of search.
[09:15:19] <[itchyjunk]> How do  you pay for the costs?
[09:15:22] <sonny> is everything hard to secure down to IP level?
[09:15:26] <Gallomimia> it's got some interesting takes on philosophy. you pay for the internet, therefore you should get the access to music too. they remit a portion of the fees to the bands
[09:15:40] <yBtNJW3j> That is probably giving a lot of credit to gmail about solving spam.  Gmail is free for whatever purpose Google used to decide it was--whether that spying on user's information, using advertisements and profitting, selling services, or charity.  Who knows?
[09:15:43] <rindolf> amigojapan: hola, mon amigo. sup?
[09:15:48] <[itchyjunk]> Gallomimia, i've heard of similar arguments but it just doesn't work.
[09:15:55] <[itchyjunk]> and has failed in usa wrt books.
[09:16:00] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: what happened before google?
[09:16:22] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, search engines pre google had more basic features but still had ads
[09:16:23] <Gallomimia> i think.... you paid for a subscription to tucows or gopher or
[09:16:25] <amigojapan> Hey rindolf I think this is my last real day off for the new year
[09:16:28] <[itchyjunk]> large enough ones at least.
[09:16:34] <sonny> I guess if you skim a bit people just searched the internet manually
[09:16:38] <[itchyjunk]> google just captured ad market better
[09:16:41] <mishugana> Google search is a terrible idea in itself ... results are clearly manipulated by the monopoly
[09:16:48] <Gallomimia> by the way, riveting discussion. glad to be here
[09:16:55] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: yes there is some talk ad market doesn't work
[09:16:55] <[itchyjunk]> ree everything is bad
[09:17:06] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, works enough for companies to pay.
[09:17:11] <Gallomimia> google's main goal was opposite of every website in the world. they wanted people to LEAVE their webpage as fast as possible.
[09:17:13] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, if it doesn't work, it's even better for end users.
[09:17:19] <Gallomimia> everyone else wanted users to stay
[09:17:21] <mishugana> that's hardly free when they're tracking your activities everywhere 
[09:17:22] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: good point
[09:17:26] <[itchyjunk]> companies are paying to subsidize internet with something that doesnt' work.
[09:17:28] <Gallomimia> and they did that the best
[09:17:33] <yBtNJW3j> I hate the way ads show up, but the site I am visiting does not work.
[09:17:39] <[itchyjunk]> what is the value of being tracked to the individual?
[09:17:40] <Gallomimia> click on google, click on your search results. click on pertinent ads. leave google.
[09:17:44] <rindolf> amigojapan: ah, i'm "unemployed"
[09:17:46] <sonny> except when it starts to get really invasive
[09:17:47] <amigojapan> Gallomimia: and come back
[09:17:48] <[itchyjunk]> i click chicken, they track it.
[09:17:56] <[itchyjunk]> oh no, they took "value" away from the user.
[09:17:58] <[itchyjunk]> Okay, how?
[09:17:59] <mishugana> yBtNJW3j: especially on phone networks ... heh

[09:18:17] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, sure, "privacy" concerns are there.
[09:18:25] <[itchyjunk]> But that doesn't negate what ads provide.

[09:19:05] <rindolf> amigojapan: i'm more productive this way
[09:19:06] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, google turned youtube profitable.
[09:19:10] <sonny> they could have done something else, but they had a smashing hit
[09:19:15] <[itchyjunk]> youtube would have sank without ad keeping it afloat.
[09:19:24] <[itchyjunk]> youtube is a very popular product on the internet.
[09:19:27] <[itchyjunk]> A lot of people use it.
[09:19:28] <amigojapan> Good good rindolf 
[09:19:29] <sonny> now many people are accustomed to free* services
[09:19:33] <rindolf> 'privacy' is a canard
[09:19:35] <[itchyjunk]> ad less internet = no youtube (like) service.
[09:19:52] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: yes, vimeo is still doing well
[09:19:55] <sonny> so both work
[09:20:05] <mishugana> I don't think YouTube is as much a value add as people seem to think 
[09:20:11] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, vimeo tracks and uses data for ads :)

[09:23:00] <rindolf> [itchyjunk]: education = entertainment = creativity
[09:23:06] <mishugana> That's a ridiculous definition of "value"
[09:23:08] <[itchyjunk]> rindolf, not sure what yo umean.
[09:23:15] <[itchyjunk]> that is the deifnition of value from economics.
[09:23:17] <[itchyjunk]> lmfao.
[09:23:19] <sonny> in general, it's a good service, works well for distributing videos
[09:23:29] <[itchyjunk]> lets go changing words till something works.
[09:23:36] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, its really good, yes.
[09:23:50] <sonny> yeah, that's why I respect google, they make good stuff
[09:23:50] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, just like twitch is a really good service provididng value in it's niche.

[09:24:42] <mishugana> Maybe so, so does any other branch of knowledge, so that's moot

[09:24:57] <[itchyjunk]> its moot because it works?

[09:25:23] <[itchyjunk]> yes, most of what you say doesn't.
[09:25:32] <sonny> Gallomimia: already happens
[09:25:36] <mishugana> When you go to a free library and read some free books and improve your knowledge, that's value
[09:25:45] <mishugana> when you pay for something, that's a service
[09:25:46] <[itchyjunk]> yBtNJW3j yes in that way

[09:27:39] <Gallomimia> as for books
[09:27:40] <mishugana> yes, because implying that when you pay for something, you get service does not equate to saying that all service is paid

[09:39:42] <sonny> well, that's harder to discuss

[09:41:27] <potatoxel[m]> does youtube red have DRM
[09:41:27] <[itchyjunk]> right, so now i move to youtube "red" where i get paid more by youtube
[09:41:31] <[itchyjunk]> but i lose ad revinue
[09:41:49] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: wait
[09:41:50] <[itchyjunk]> so based on your earlier claim, this is better for me.
[09:41:51] <mishugana> Yes, a million prank videos and half a million bad tutorials from some random country while the real good content is hidden away because of fewer views, that's not what I call value at all. Viewcount is a terrible measure of something's innate value.
[09:42:05] <[itchyjunk]> People don't see ads, and revinue is based on users "paying" for subscription

[09:42:06] <[itchyjunk]> right?
[09:42:08] <mishugana> Heh
[09:42:14] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: so before, you get paid for x amount of suscribers, + ad revenue
[09:42:25] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, some formula like that
[09:42:25] <sonny> and with red, it's just what?
[09:42:35] <[itchyjunk]> it's based on "subscribers"
[09:42:40] <[itchyjunk]> no ad part of the formula
[09:42:42] <sonny> ah
[09:42:49] <sonny> see that's the thing
[09:42:51] <[itchyjunk]> but you get better payouts for your users
[09:42:54] <mishugana> don't forget the third-party sponsors in the video itself :D

[09:43:06] <[itchyjunk]> i mean, lifes hard
[09:43:13] <sonny> for example, twitch seems to do well with dedicated subs
[09:43:14] <[itchyjunk]> but it's not crazy concepts we're discussing here
[09:43:15] <mishugana> so you get ads from YouTube, ads from the creator, and ads from third party sponsors... good times!
[09:43:19] <yBtNJW3j> Also, some would counter about those whose videos get stolen or claims of not getting paid, etc.
[09:43:26] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, twitch has massive ads based payouts
[09:43:29] <sonny> I'm gonna guess people don't sub as much for youtube
[09:43:34] <[itchyjunk]> twitch is partially subscription based.
[09:43:36] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: sure they do
[09:43:51] <flakland> youtube literally has a "merch window" or area in the html, where the starving content creaators hawk their t-shirts and hats

[09:44:21] <[itchyjunk]> you can sub to channels if they are partnered
[09:44:34] <flakland> the site is definitely serving malicious code as of 2 days ago
[09:44:40] <mishugana> YouTube?
[09:44:42] <flakland> yeah
[09:44:45] <tokerboker> hi 
[09:44:53] <tokerboker> youtube has always been malicious
[09:44:55] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, but going back to youtube, it seemed that people prefered the free with ads model over subscription
[09:44:57] <mishugana> Oh
[09:45:06] <sonny> ok
[09:45:07] <tokerboker> it makes me click a video and then eats my next 2 hours.
[09:45:11] <mishugana> Great, another reason to stay away from that time sink
[09:45:12] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, people "voted" with their wallet, so to speak
[09:45:33] <tokerboker> everyone wants privacy, till they are asked to pay. then they are okay with ads and personalization.
[09:45:42] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[09:45:53] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: so twitch is really the same thing?
[09:45:54] <[itchyjunk]> people would prefer ad over paying money for shit is my point too
[09:46:01] <tokerboker> always.
[09:46:05] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, it's not the same thing, it's hybrid
[09:46:05] <sonny> they seem to make a killing on subs
[09:46:07] <potatoxel[m]> i kinda mostly am watching less youtube
[09:46:12] <potatoxel[m]> i dont prefer ads

[09:46:23] <potatoxel[m]> i prefer nothing over videos with ads 
[09:46:28] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, twitch gives a large percent of sub revinue to "verified streamers"
[09:46:32] <[itchyjunk]> its like 60%+
[09:46:33] <mishugana> most content is shite anyway ... and finding what you want is half an hour of misery
[09:46:39] <[itchyjunk]> twitch itself makes a lot more money from ad revinue
[09:46:41] <sonny> I saw pokimane get a lot from a single sub but I didn't confirm if it was fake lol

[09:47:24] <sonny> oh
[09:47:38] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, even more reason for twitch to put more ads there.

[09:47:47] <potatoxel[m]> :3
[09:47:57] <sonny> they do have a lot yeah
[09:48:33] <tokerboker> this makes me wonder, will people really switch to blockchain and pay for every transaction just to have more privacy?
[09:48:42] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, so ads are a double edged sword.
[09:48:49] <potatoxel[m]> blockchain isn't private
[09:48:52] <[itchyjunk]> no ads means a lot of things will stop being free on the internet.
[09:49:00] <potatoxel[m]> its only anonymous well depends on the implementation
[09:49:01] <tokerboker> its pseudonymized.
[09:49:05] <[itchyjunk]> on the other hand, too much ads means there is no content
[09:49:09] <[itchyjunk]> just ads 24/7
[09:49:10] <potatoxel[m]> yeh
[09:49:13] <tokerboker> and hence gives privacy.
[09:49:15] <Gallomimia> privacy? where every full node on the network needs a full copy of all transactions, and they have websites where you can explore the blockchain?
[09:49:16] <tokerboker> its not private.

[10:05:25] <Satin> just don't be surprised if people react very poorly to such statements is all I'd say.
[10:05:31] <EdFletcher> Satin is correct here, that was an indeed a bad take 
[10:05:34] <mishugana> Satin: I am not the one reducing it to anything ... if said people who got rid of it call themselves feminists, then that's what the world will call them too. If said nutjobs have appropriated the movement itself, then the movement itself has become synonymous with them

[10:05:50] <mishugana> That doesn't mean that one should inject disclaimers all the time when describing them
[10:06:01] <[itchyjunk]> That seems like a poor standard.
[10:06:05] <mishugana> The onus is on the feminists to reclaim their movement
[10:06:18] <Gallomimia> i think several of you might be very shocked to find out the feminist movement was all about control, and not rights. tho it did pretend to be bout rights
[10:06:23] <mishugana> EdFletcher: I fully disagree
[10:06:36] <rindolf> mishugana: there are many schools of feminism
[10:06:37] <mishugana> Gallomimia: very true... at least past the formative years
[10:06:39] <sonny> guess I stumbled into a history lesson lol
[10:06:42] <Satin> It does sound like you're generalizing it to that. I don't really want to turn this into a fullblown argument or discussion about this, but this whole take just sounds bad and unnuanced "lol modern feminism has gone too far, it sucks!"
[10:06:48] <EdFletcher> "feminists are a joke because of this one thing that happened that a few people didn't like, so the movement itself is devalued" 😆 
[10:06:49] <Gallomimia> no, all of it
[10:06:50] <mishugana> rindolf: indeed .. .hence my claim is not incorrect
[10:06:51] <Satin> rindolf: exactly, that as well
[10:06:55] <Satin> EdFletcher: ikr
[10:07:02] <mishugana> EdFletcher: Please read my comments again. 
[10:07:04] <apotheon> I think this channel has entered "this conversation is going nowhere good" territory, and all might be better off dropping it, but I'm not a mod, so . . . whatever.
[10:07:07] <apotheon> I'm going to bed.
[10:07:08] <apotheon> g'night
[10:07:09] <Satin> Gallomimia with the even more horrid take
[10:07:11] <EdFletcher> oh i did mishugana, twice. 
[10:07:14] <Satin> gnight apotheon 
[10:07:14] <[itchyjunk]> feminisn is what got women voting rights and ability to get divorce without their husbands permission in some parts of the world
[10:07:17] <Gallomimia> got a bunch of broken homes and split parents and traumatized kids to prove it
[10:07:22] <EdFletcher> mishugana: i see what you're saying. not sure _you_ do. 
[10:07:26] <Satin> Gallomimia: uh huh
[10:07:31] <yBtNJW3j> Feminism (or followers) does have some inconsistencies like criticizing men for drinking in the decades before, but ignoring women who drink today.
[10:07:33] <mishugana> EdFletcher: Then you probaby either don't understand the subtext or you intentinally choose not do so
[10:07:49] <[itchyjunk]> Any philosophical movement might have a vocal minority.
[10:07:51] <Gallomimia> as for voting rights, i can think of large numbers of men who shouldn't have the right to vote, so i don't really want to talk about women's voting rights
[10:07:58] <Satin> [itchyjunk]: +1
[10:08:00] <[itchyjunk]> A vocal minority doesn't represent the philosophical school itself.
[10:08:23] <mishugana> If men can be labelled as such when discussing issues that affect women, calling out "feminists" in this particulat context shouldn't be a problem, if it's understood that the context matters, including the fact that there are different groups who view the movement differently, within
[10:08:28] <EdFletcher> mishugana: lol "subtext", yes that always goes over well here. i understand perfectly, again not sure you do or are reading our points, but that's par for the course 'round here. 
[10:08:30] <Gallomimia> i struggle to find a way to suggest that there should be some prequalifications required before you're allowed to vote, without it turning into a "who gets to decide" issue like the first amendment
[10:08:30] <Satin> Gallomimia: You sound very edgy.
[10:08:43] <[itchyjunk]> The claim wasn't context specific.
[10:08:50] <[itchyjunk]> It was a generealization of entire feminist movement.
[10:08:52] <mishugana> EdFletcher: Then whither the problem? 
[10:08:55] <[itchyjunk]> In which case, the claims don't hold.
[10:08:59] <Satin> You're going to discount women being able to vote because... you have issues with some women voting, alright bud.
[10:09:07] <Satin> s/some women/some men/
[10:09:14] <mishugana> [itchyjunk]: well, I can't help you there 
[10:09:25] <[itchyjunk]> I don't need your help.
[10:09:26] <EdFletcher> mishugana: this last message to me is literally surrounded by the argument you are ignoring 😆 🤦‍♂️ e 
[10:09:31] <[itchyjunk]> I'm saying you should help yourself.
[10:09:38] <rindolf> mishugana: i love https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer and https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic

[10:09:57] <mishugana> [itchyjunk]: Please don't bother.
[10:10:12] <[itchyjunk]> Please worry about yourself and stop telling me what to do or not.
[10:10:13] <EdFletcher> lol they didn't offer. READ. 
[10:10:16] <mishugana> EdFletcher: Yes, maybe you shouldn't bother either
[10:10:24] <sonny> so ... about ads
[10:10:27] <EdFletcher> where's Levar Burton and Reading Rainbow when you need him!? 
[10:10:44] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, this issue would have been fixed with targeted ads.
[10:10:48] <EdFletcher> mishugana: oh i'll bother. as long as it's bothering you, i'll bother. 😜 
[10:11:01] <yBtNJW3j> From my experience of dating, I can tell you it takes a lot of work for a man to find and keep a good woman.  Easy divorce creates certain kinds of problems.
[10:11:02] <[itchyjunk]> would have taught some people "feminism" is an umbrella term and not one particular philosophy.
[10:11:04] <mishugana> Go ahead and amuse yourself ... I'm not really interested 
[10:11:15] <EdFletcher> mishugana: oh no? why bring it up in the first place then? 
[10:11:17] <Satin> this issue would have been fixed with web3
[10:11:26] <sonny> isn't it web3 now?
[10:11:28] <EdFletcher> lol yup, we need some weeb3 
[10:11:32] <[itchyjunk]> yBtNJW3j, why date when you can code a girlfriend?
[10:11:40] <mishugana> EdFletcher: Well, that's not really your concern now, is it?
[10:11:41] <sonny> o.O
[10:12:22] <EdFletcher> mishugana: nope, they're called "rhetorical questions" 🤣 
[10:12:24] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: sorry, but the english language is too fluid for that or something idk
[10:12:30] <mishugana> EdFletcher: yawn
[10:12:37] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, NLP
[10:12:42] <yBtNJW3j> I am not really that kind of a programmer; I could not code a girlfriend, and that would be kind of unnatural.
[10:13:01] <sonny> "kind of"
[10:13:02] <[itchyjunk]> yBtNJW3j, what about someone else coding a gf for you and you could use it
[10:13:13] <[itchyjunk]> but she randomly mentions products that maybe ads?
[10:13:34] <[itchyjunk]> "hello dear, you should buy some tide pod with new formula that can clearn all your clothes today"
[10:13:43] <EdFletcher> now _that_ is dystopian 
[10:13:49] <[itchyjunk]> :o
[10:13:54] <sonny> lol
[10:14:49] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: tldr ads are the real currency of the internet
[10:15:04] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[10:15:06] <Gallomimia> depends if she says the tide pods can get out all the cum stains she just got on her
[10:15:22] <[itchyjunk]> sure, she can incorporate the products in all types of witty way
[10:15:33] <nomagno> I'd go back to Luddism if this happened
[10:15:34] <[itchyjunk]> "personalized ads" are supposed to be this way anyways
[10:15:36] <nomagno> Burn all machines
[10:15:41] <Gallomimia> so like.... alexa, but you can fuck her?
[10:15:51] <mishugana> :O
[10:15:51] <Gallomimia> hmmmm
[10:15:53] <Gallomimia> tempting.
[10:15:54] <[itchyjunk]> yes but only if you buy the upgraded model
[10:16:04] <[itchyjunk]> the basic model only lets you talk
[10:16:11] <Gallomimia> you have to buy the upgraded model if you want to have sex with your virtual girlfriend?
[10:16:17] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[10:16:26] <Gallomimia> i'm pretty sure someone will find a way around that little restrction bud.
[10:16:36] <[itchyjunk]> sure, but not everyone will
[10:16:36] <yBtNJW3j> lol
[10:16:42] <[itchyjunk]> and those who don't will be enough of a market.
[10:16:54] <[itchyjunk]> just like some people torrenting didn't kill the music/movie industry
[10:17:13] <sonny> heh
[10:17:16] <[itchyjunk]> this isn't "girlfriend"
[10:17:25] <[itchyjunk]> i can be boy/girl/animals/anime
[10:17:25] <sonny> are most people who torrent leechers?
[10:17:26] <[itchyjunk]> w/e you want
[10:17:36] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, yes that was the claim back in the day
[10:17:51] <[itchyjunk]> that's what things like what.cd existed
[10:17:53] <sonny> I never considered how something like the internet can be used to study social structures
[10:17:56] <[itchyjunk]> where "seeding' was currency
[10:18:15] <[itchyjunk]> internet culture is a branch that many social sciences specializes in
[10:18:19] <[itchyjunk]> you can get phd in it
[10:18:21] <inhahe_> i couldn't find a good torrent client where you can disable uploading so i'm not a leecher
[10:18:22] <sonny> I'm gonna guess most warez folks are immature

[10:20:11] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: not *that* interested
[10:20:25] <sonny> but sure, it'd be nice to see what people find out
[10:20:33] <[itchyjunk]> well, i got hooked onto anthropology by having 2 back to back great professors
[10:20:49] <Gallomimia> it is a rather interesting subject
[10:20:49] <[itchyjunk]> the first one was insane. she had a phd in biology and one in anthropology
[10:20:58] <sonny> anthropology kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth
[10:21:10] <[itchyjunk]> not when you skip the pop science part ofi t
[10:21:15] <[itchyjunk]> and get to the meat of it
[10:21:24] <Gallomimia> feels weird having all those labels applied to things you thought were basically organic growth of peoples
[10:21:26] <sonny> so, like don't people study themselves?
[10:21:34] <[itchyjunk]> "humans" lost their special place
[10:21:40] <sonny> like families or cultures 
[10:21:53] <[itchyjunk]> sure, but they study "themsleves" form a very rational pov
[10:22:12] <[itchyjunk]> like understanding there were a lot of "human like" things walking around not too long ago
[10:22:23] <[itchyjunk]> and that our ancestors fucked with them and they are all dead
[10:22:30] <[itchyjunk]> neanderthals or denosivens etc
[10:22:47] <[itchyjunk]> it changed my pov of what "human" means altogether
[10:23:28] <[itchyjunk]> or seeing how brain size gradually grew and how that correlated with behavior
[10:23:37] <[itchyjunk]> at some point, it could no longer grew
[10:23:45] <sonny> I'm super late (fortunately?) and the mead situation did strike me as an island dream ...
[10:23:53] <[itchyjunk]> i have all sorts of hypothesis of what language, literacy etc means wrt that
[10:23:59] <[itchyjunk]> even AI fits into this hypothesis
[10:24:08] <[itchyjunk]> mead situation?
[10:24:35] <Gallomimia> sorr what does wrt mean?
[10:24:36] <sonny> so, I recall reading an pl book that mentioned two very interesting models on how languages are formed, but I forgot already

[10:24:45] <Gallomimia> ok thanks
[10:25:54] <[itchyjunk]> basically, "modern human" was where we reached the physical limit of brain to body ratio.
[10:26:04] <[itchyjunk]> so the only way was to "externalize the task"
[10:26:15] <Gallomimia> with ipads
[10:26:20] <[itchyjunk]> storage was externalized by "language"
[10:26:33] <[itchyjunk]> oral story telling was baiscally thing. but it was inaccurate so we had writing and such
[10:26:42] <Gallomimia> cave painting
[10:26:50] <[itchyjunk]> but "searching" was still a thing for brain. you have to read and search for a text in book by yourself
[10:27:01] <[itchyjunk]> this stayed this way for most of modern humans history till computers
[10:27:02] <Gallomimia> damn i can't tell it as good as grandpa... if only we had it written down
[10:27:21] <[itchyjunk]> so then we externalized searching too
[10:27:30] <[itchyjunk]> but processing was still done by humans
[10:27:37] <[itchyjunk]> is this a dog or a muffin?
[10:27:45] <[itchyjunk]> you needed `the brain` for it still
[10:27:49] <[itchyjunk]> till very recent times
[10:27:49] <Gallomimia> eh
[10:27:59] <[itchyjunk]> now we're extenalizing "computation" of it too
[10:28:09] <Gallomimia> i think we invented all the stuff you were talking about long before muffins. maybe before dogs too
[10:28:17] <[itchyjunk]> "tl;dr?" needed a human to read a thing and tell you what it's about
[10:28:37] <[itchyjunk]> this will be externalized soon
[10:28:46] <[itchyjunk]> it "frees up" brain even more.

[10:30:03] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: machine that tells you something
[10:30:11] <[itchyjunk]> synchronizing is important to "externalize brain"
[10:30:16] <Gallomimia> if you need a crew of 10 guys to do a certain task, you want them to all show up at the same "time"
[10:31:08] <[itchyjunk]> social anthropology also gave me the sense that my idea of "humans from past" being primitive and us being "modern" was wrong.
[10:31:22] <[itchyjunk]> Average person hasn't changed much from few thousand years ago.
[10:31:30] <[itchyjunk]> What has changed is the society `it` lives in
[10:31:39] <Gallomimia> as a great man once said, culture is our operating system
[10:31:46] <[itchyjunk]> hmm right
[10:31:48] <Gallomimia> our culture evolved for awhile
[10:32:00] <Gallomimia> then it went backwards because a certain culture is easier to control

[10:32:57] <[itchyjunk]> it hasn't change that much since humans have been around

[10:33:20] <sonny> hmm
[10:33:20] <[itchyjunk]> the receeding of last ice age is when humans migrated to americas
[10:33:48] <Gallomimia> well. no sonny. it hasn't always been the same. for awhile there, there was a lot more carbon dioxide in the air. then some animals started to walk around

[10:43:37] <[itchyjunk]> ozone layers probably appeared and disappeared

[10:44:01] <[itchyjunk]> the more stable ozone layers probably have their own complicated origin stories

[10:46:53] <[itchyjunk]> doubt classical computers will ever produce something that's detailed enough to what i'd wanna see
[10:47:10] <Gallomimia> it was called the "earth simulator" i'm just not exactly sure what they did on it
[10:47:14] <[itchyjunk]> the types of lightning that happen in upper atmospehre, we've only know about those for 20 years i think?
[10:47:15] <Gallomimia> something like this tho
[10:47:20] <[itchyjunk]> after ISS and such at least
[10:47:34] <Gallomimia> uhm... pretty sure all lightning forms ozone?
[10:47:42] <Gallomimia> as does sparks from an electric motor
[10:48:05] <[itchyjunk]> the ones from lower atmosphere to surface forms tiny amount and not significant enough to explain ozone layer
[10:48:30] <[itchyjunk]> its the upper atm to upper atm ones that ionize a lot of oxygen
[10:48:49] <Gallomimia> hm.... why?
[10:48:50] <[itchyjunk]> at least i think that's the type of lightning you were mentioning as a major contributor
[10:48:54] <[itchyjunk]> i might be wrong though
[10:49:00] <Gallomimia> there's.... the same amount of oxygen in both areas?
[10:49:18] <[itchyjunk]> the lightnings happening there are MASSIVE
[10:49:26] <Gallomimia> ohhhh
[10:49:36] <[itchyjunk]> a lot of energy from electromagnetic radiation is captures in the upper atmosphere
[10:49:43] <Gallomimia> and the ISS detected them....but not MIR?
[10:49:46] <[itchyjunk]> captures*
[10:49:55] <[itchyjunk]> some scientist predicted it
[10:50:00] <[itchyjunk]> and everyone laughed at them for years
[10:50:13] <[itchyjunk]> then he started looking for signs and he noted reports from here and there 
[10:50:24] <[itchyjunk]> like high altitute secret military spy planes and such
[10:50:39] <[itchyjunk]> i don't remember the details anymore. i watched a documentary on lightnings ages ago

[11:11:15] <horseface> I'm trying to hack the government but my mum won't let me.
[11:11:23] <Gallomimia> guud
[11:11:29] <sonny> those are from D,Q on the flip flops? state machine is confusing to me too
[11:11:41] <Gallomimia> they are from Q on each flip flop
[11:11:44] <Gallomimia> not D
[11:12:09] <Gallomimia> the number along each arrow is the input at the time of a clock signal
[11:13:02] <sonny> ok, but 4 states?
[11:13:24] <sonny> is that because 1 flip flop handles 2 states?
[11:13:26] <Gallomimia> 2 possible states in each flip flop, 2 flip flops, 2^2 is 2
[11:13:31] <sonny> ok
[11:13:45] <Gallomimia> if it was 3 flipflops it'd be 2^3 not 3^2

[11:14:28] <Gallomimia> so 4 possible states. the question at the bottom says, how many of them could return to the same state
[11:14:36] <sonny> any reason why I cannot use D, Q, D', Q'
[11:14:51] <Gallomimia> and the answer is, only ones where the Q's are homogeneous

[13:08:19] <epony> you like how kids drive imaginary cars with sounds and effects, the sound is the arrays and the effects are the pointers
[13:09:20] <pyzozord> mrig: sadly :(
[13:09:48] <deniska> tomathy: what differs between writing `char *foo = "bar"` and `char foo[4] = "bar"` is that in the first case `foo` likely points to read only data section where program's constant strings are stored, and in the latter case `foo` likely points to a small array allocated on the stack, which got 4 bytes assigned or copied from a static section

[13:13:12] <epony> high level programming adds more functionality which you have to know or defer that to the "problems" you don't (care to) know about
[13:14:03] * deniska wrote ~240 lines of C yesterday, that makes me practical expert :D
[13:14:19] <epony> the practical recommendation is to not use constructs you do not know about, just after learning what they do and what are their use cases and application notes
[13:14:21] <mrig> pyzozord oh you seem to be doing ok, figuring it all out still I think; Happy and sad are about as ephemeral as the weather and caused by similar events to, you just need a little wet weather gear when it rains and a water bottle when there is a drought.

[13:15:14] <deniska> rsonx: I think java has that too
[13:15:39] <Gallomimia> why, hello world alone has overloaded operators and objects galore without telling you how they work
[13:15:40] <deniska> it's just the pattern is much rarely seen used because java has exceptions to report errors
[13:15:44] <epony> so, it's like unknown texts you read and reuse, when you use words and constructs you did not know about, you might have unpredictable or unexpected results

[16:56:47] <reptilian> Yeah.. I sadly don't remember the names of the features it touted, like the memory safety related stuff. It felt similar to rust or haskell.. The name of the language i think was similar to vala, but I might be wrong. The logo was a ball, where three 'sides' of the ball were three different colors, with gradients in-between.

[20:29:57] <sonny> ThePhilgrim: yes
[20:29:59] <rickame> i guess CI/CD are best run on a server so more than 1 dev can use it
[20:30:04] <bjs> rickame: if you make a bunch of automation scripts right now,  quite likely is that it won't scale and if you gain extra people working on your project or if the number of tests grows such that you don't want to do it on every save you'll end up just using standard CI tools anyway
[20:30:04] <sonny> "to solv"
[20:30:16] <rickame> does that mean that the master repo is also on the CI/CD server instead of on my comp?
[20:30:22] <ThePhilgrim> Thanks
[20:30:25] <ThePhilgrim> "...to solve problems as they come. Now my question is, should I use Flask for the backend (and put all my eggs in Python), or should I use Node (to broaden my horizons)?"
[20:30:49] <bjs> rickame: I would say that a lot of people would designate a particular repo to be "the master" one and it doesn't necessarily have to be either.
[20:31:02] <bjs> rickame: for example maybe the CI server just clones+pulls the repo just like you do
[20:31:03] <sonny> ThePhilgrim: so your SPA handles some networking?

[20:31:50] <pyzozord> meh the new mouse the same thing old mouse did
[20:31:51] <bjs> rickame: with something like git, there isn't really a "master repo" anyway, it's just that us humans decide "this copy is the primary one"
[20:32:33] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, basically I'd like to make a couple of tools (think whatever, calculator, magic 8 ball, tic tac toe) sharing the same dashboard and background template
[20:32:52] <ThePhilgrim> And it will live in the browser
[20:33:28] <ThePhilgrim> So the dashboard and background would be a template, and the html would be loaded in dynamically (however one does that xD)

[20:35:47] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, Like I said, it will be a full stack thingy with frontend, server & db
[20:36:02] <bjs> rickame: I see, there's lots of CIs out there from the stuff that comes with gitlab/github, to dedicated CI server software like jenkins
[20:36:08] <sonny> so your schema is defined already?
[20:36:15] <ThePhilgrim> Or rather, I said it would be full stack, not that it would include a db :P
[20:36:31] <bjs> rickame: I mean like I say once you start working with other people you want the CI on the server otherwise everyone that you work with now needs to download and setup their own CI on their own machines locally
[20:36:32] <ThePhilgrim> sonny: excuse my ignorance. What is a "schema" in this context?
[20:36:45] <sonny> ThePhilgrim: it is the blueprint for the database
[20:37:13] <rickame> what do you do if you're just making a project solo? do you still run CI on a server like maybe a vm locally?
[20:37:33] <bjs> rickame: like I said earlier if you're making a project solo, and you have 10 unit tests then it doesn't really matter :P
[20:37:37] <ThePhilgrim> Oh, no! I've never worked with a database before. I have some different ideas for tools that I want to develop, and I'd like to put them on the same platform. All the developing will be a learning process

[20:38:42] <rickame> ThePhilgrim: wanna learn to code for fun or serious?
[20:38:45] <bjs> rickame: but a little makefile/bash script that runs as a pre-commit hook or simply on save every time is likely to be perfectly fine if you're doing it solo

[20:44:07] <ThePhilgrim> Right, I think an SQL database would make sense for my purposes (if I've understood them correctly)
[20:44:36] <sonny> it will cover all you data needs in a pragmatic sense
[20:44:42] <ThePhilgrim> But yeah, like I said, Express, similar to Flask has routing and logic for http requests etc
[20:45:04] <apotheon> ThePhilgrim: I like programming with Flask more than with Node.js, but I like Node.js more than any other Python programming I've ever touched, so if the above about Node.js vs. Flask is going to determine what language you learn . . . in your place, I'd be better off with Node.js.
[20:45:15] <ThePhilgrim> I just don't know if I should continue focusing hard on Python, or widen my horizons with JS

[20:53:34] <nomagno> Maybe wanting to do so is just a me thing
[20:53:37] <sonny> 4 years is enough time for another popular framework
[20:53:59] <ThePhilgrim> Right now it's mostly to get really solid foundations in problem solving, familiarity with concepts, etc. Working on a full stack app will teach me a lot about how severs work, http, databases in general etc
[20:54:29] <apotheon> ThePhilgrim: If you want a single-page application served over the web, you are basically forced to use JavaScript, because Flask only runs server-side.
[20:54:31] <sonny> ok, well if that's your intuition, then go for it
[20:54:46] <ThePhilgrim> apotheon: Yeah, it would of course be JS on the front end
[20:54:57] <ThePhilgrim> I'm thinking for server side if I should do Flask or Express
[20:55:00] <apotheon> ThePhilgrim: Thus, if you're specifically looking to do some SPA dev, you've essentially made your decision to use Node.js/JavaScript.
[20:55:18] <ThePhilgrim> okay :)
[20:55:19] <nomagno> Uh, JavaScript, not NodeJS, I think
[20:55:21] <sonny> how so?
[20:55:30] <apotheon> I'd be more inclined to use Express if just for fun (for the back end).
[20:55:44] <nomagno> apotheon: client-side is much more elegant in my opinion
[20:55:56] <apotheon> I guess it's Express.js . . .
[20:55:59] <nomagno> But both server and client are heavily abused nowadays+
[20:56:26] <ThePhilgrim> I'm just a bit overwhelmed of all the stuff in a JS stack.. like webpack, docker, all the front end frameworks, all the back end frameworks etc etc :P

[20:57:20] <ThePhilgrim> Front end will be the least complex part
[20:57:32] <nomagno> ThePhilgrim: Hm, what part of your tool suite would need server-side processing?
[20:57:38] <nomagno> or is it just for practice?
[20:58:14] <apotheon> It seems to be exploratory purposes.
[20:58:23] <nomagno> Well, then yeah
[20:58:44] <apotheon> In my experience, client-side webdev is a damned mess by comparison, especially compared to something pretty simple and elegant like Flask, though.
[20:58:47] <nomagno> I don't really know anything about modern backend-frontend interactions
[20:58:51] <nomagno> I know both HTTP and WebSockets... exist.
[20:59:23] <sonny> I heard web sockets are browser independent?
[20:59:23] <ThePhilgrim> Well, for one tool for example, each user will be able to store different clients, and each client will have different salary rates, and some similar info. The user will then, based on client, be able to calculate their rates for work projects etc. So, I need to store the users, the clients they've added, and all the info related to each client
[20:59:26] <nomagno> apotheon: Well thing is, I don't really ever feel inclined to design these fancy interactive UIs

[21:00:25] <apotheon> Anything you need with a centralized database is going to need some server-side code, though.
[21:00:41] <nomagno> Yeah but that's not really processing
[21:00:43] <apotheon> The only way to avoid that would be if you're using someone else's server-side application for an API.
[21:00:45] <nomagno> that's just querying
[21:00:49] <nomagno> which is the main thing servers do
[21:01:16] <ThePhilgrim> I assume the queries to the database will be done on the server?
[21:01:27] <sonny> yeah
[21:01:51] <apotheon> Yeah, direct queries to the DB would be server-side code, then the client-side code would talk to the server-side API.
[21:02:08] <apotheon> Working on APIs is another area to explore as you learn, too.
[21:02:12] <ThePhilgrim> Also, if I go to bunchofcooltools.com/tool1 , the loading of the relevant html and functionality will be loaded in from the server?

[21:16:11] <apotheon> In fact, I reimplemented all the necessary stuff for Flux on top of React at one point because it was A) the best way to really understand Flux at the time (most people who started using it that early did so without really understanding it, I think), and B) a better implementation than the official Flux dispatcher library.

[21:17:23] <apotheon> TLS "solves" the problem of key exchange and trust by saying "I know -- I'll trust a bunch of extra entities that aren't entirely trustworthy!"

[21:20:32] <nomagno> Actually, this doesn't sound like a bad idea for key exchange: Send the public key 100000 times, and if it arrives mangled a single time you throw it away.

[21:21:02] <sonny> they already have redundancy checks?
[21:21:08] <apotheon> nomagno: When you send the key a bunch of times, you should use distinct channels for communication.  If you do it over the same channel, and it's compromised, that may not fix anything.

[21:21:50] <nomagno> apotheon: That's obvious, and also might want to send a hash for the key over a bunch of different channels
[21:22:24] <apotheon> The standard answer is out-of-band key exchange, which is in a way what PKI does, but with PKI the out-of-band exchange also requires trust, which . . . kinda defeats (some of?) the purpose of out-of-band exchange.
[21:22:28] <nomagno> sonny: Not mangled, just changed. It's very easy for a bad actor to setup a single-pass search-and-replace for anything that looks like a key with their own public key

[21:23:53] <sonny> need to review alice and bob
[21:24:13] <apotheon> sonny: You send a key.  The MITM intercepts it, and sends a different key to the other end.  Thus, the MITM can continuously intercept data, re-encrypt and send it on (possibly with changes to the data if that's the point of interception), and thus always monitor (and potentially change) everything that passes through without either side being any the wiser.
[21:24:28] <sonny> ugh

[22:50:48] <apotheon> Current uses of NFTs are more like a plaque in a building, except instead of in a building it's on your computer, and instead of a plaque it's just a photo, and maybe the building doesn't exist either.
[22:51:08] <[itchyjunk]> and the game engine promises that the hash representing this instance of the object to be yours.
[22:51:12] <InPhase> BurumaSerafuku: And you can then sell the record of your donation if someone else thinks they want to hold onto that record of donation instead.  Why would they?  Not sure.
[22:51:23] <[itchyjunk]> if you sell the hash, you sell the representation of this instance of a boss sword etc.

[22:54:59] <bayaz> Title: How RuneScape is helping Venezuelans survive 
[22:55:26] <[itchyjunk]> runescape was a neat game
[22:55:32] <[itchyjunk]> can't endorse their current model though
[22:55:37] <apotheon> So . . . on the subject of NFTs, if a widely-accepted "authority" held records of ownership of some tangible thing (e.g. title to a piece of land), that would arguably have meaning (q.v. governments).
[22:55:43] <epony> the point quoted data from wikipedia.. I linked to it ;-)
[22:55:52] <EdFletcher> [itchyjunk]: well there are _two_ games, and yes RS3 is crap, but OSRS is still beautifully pure 
[22:56:02] <EdFletcher> and that's what the article is discussing 
[22:56:06] <apotheon> That "authority" could be replaced with a blockchain database with NFTs as title records.
[22:56:29] <EdFletcher> in fact OSRS uses a model i've never seen in any other game: all continued development is _voted on_ by the player base, and Jagex just implements whatever they decide. seriously.

[22:56:55] <apotheon> It's absurd.
[22:57:16] <[itchyjunk]> specific instances does make sense in some context, though.
[22:57:17] <apotheon> The copyright holder could pass out copies endlessly without affecting the NFT associated with it.
[22:57:18] <EdFletcher> [itchyjunk]: yup it is, but with some significant divergences. and obviously the visual quality is _vastly_ different 😆 
[22:57:23] <[itchyjunk]> Say a sword drop from a boss.
[22:57:33] <[itchyjunk]> you can't uniquely own all sword from the boss
[22:57:37] <[itchyjunk]> else no more multiplayers
[22:57:44] <[itchyjunk]> but you do want to own that specific instance of it
[22:58:14] <[itchyjunk]> yeah i did get a 99 slayer on the new RS without paying

[22:58:25] <[itchyjunk]> 18 hours of slayering a day
[22:58:26] <apotheon> If the "sword" can just get duplicated, though, it doesn't matter.

[22:58:48] <[itchyjunk]> the sword thats getting dropped by the boss is not yours
[22:58:51] <EdFletcher> if a P2W model for RS3 allows OSRS to continue to survive & thrive as it is, I'm all for it. if you don't like the P2W model, the same company has nearly the same game that isn't, so i don't really know why people complain. 
[22:58:53] <[itchyjunk]> the one you get is yours
[22:58:54] <apotheon> It's not like these NFTs serve some unique utility in a closed system the way a rare drop in WoW does.

[23:00:55] <tomathy> too complicated
[23:00:55] <apotheon> . . . unless you're specifically looking to just add a "tradable outside the game" feature for rare drops.
[23:00:57] <[itchyjunk]> games with internal markey already has databases
[23:01:07] <apotheon> yep
[23:01:12] <apotheon> they do
[23:01:13] <[itchyjunk]> which can be replaced by some type of "block chain" database
[23:01:25] <[itchyjunk]> so for those type of games, its not that crazy of a leap
[23:01:26] <apotheon> What's the point if the rest of the game isn't decentralized?
[23:01:42] <[itchyjunk]> why is rest of the game being decentralized important?
[23:01:52] <[itchyjunk]> the game can better represent it's internal market
[23:02:05] <[itchyjunk]> runescape market had a HUGE issue with "stolen items"
[23:02:08] <[itchyjunk]> for several years
[23:02:21] <[itchyjunk]> they tried all sorts of methods to mitigate
[23:02:36] <[itchyjunk]> they even sued 3rd party websites doing in game trading for IRL money
[23:02:36] <apotheon> If the whole game is centralized except for the Sword Of Mishra, I'm not sure what point there is to spin up a blockchain just to facilitate trade of the Sword Of Mishra when you could do it within the game's own database.
[23:02:48] <[itchyjunk]> NFT would have been a very good solution to that problem.
[23:03:01] <[itchyjunk]> all "unique items" would be NFT represented.
[23:03:06] <apotheon> It's like saying "We're going to run a web application here with PostgreSQL on the back end, but we're going to store password hashes encrypted in a blockchain."
[23:03:09] <apotheon> Why?
[23:03:10] <EdFletcher> exactly, what value does "Sword of X" have outside the context of its game? 
[23:03:17] <[itchyjunk]> to manage the internal game market?
[23:03:22] <deniska> NFT people are talking about "items in the game" as if an item in the game isn't 1) something which has to be envisioned by a game designer, 2) something which has to be coded by a programmer, 3) something which has to be fleshed into a 3d model or a 2d sprite by an artist
[23:03:48] <[itchyjunk]> "Designed by someone"
[23:03:53] <macaw> I'm agreeing with apotheon. Sounds like a waste of Earth's resources for not much of value.
[23:03:55] <[itchyjunk]> there is already a legal concept covering that case.
[23:04:01] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: Sticking magic items in a blockchain would just be a way to make them tradable outside the game, and if the game company is suing for trading outside the game . . . I don't know why they'd want to facilitate trading outside the game.
[23:04:04] <[itchyjunk]> NFT doesn't have to relpace already existing legal systems.
[23:04:20] <[itchyjunk]> apotheon, it can be traded outside but doesn't have to be.
[23:04:25] <[itchyjunk]> It can be traded ingame.
[23:04:28] <apotheon> You can manage the internal game market more fully by having the market . . . inside the game.
[23:04:35] <[itchyjunk]> Games have full fledged in game markets.
[23:04:37] <apotheon> . . . instead of on a separate database.
[23:04:37] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: no. I'm talking if someone designed a thing in GTA 5, it can't just magically appear in Skyrim
[23:04:42] <[itchyjunk]> RS markets have inbuilt inflation.
[23:04:43] <deniska> Like, just, *technically*
[23:04:56] <apotheon> Think of it as being like using PostgreSQL in your game, but for some reason sticking your swords in SQLite.

[23:08:48] <[itchyjunk]> blockchain isn't decentralized by existence. it's by implementation
[23:08:55] <[itchyjunk]> IBM's DLT wouldn't be decentralized
[23:08:56] <apotheon> One can very easily represent unique items in PostgreSQL.
[23:09:00] <[itchyjunk]> but can act like a blockchain
[23:09:12] <[itchyjunk]> so this claim that decentralization is `the only point` is moot
[23:09:15] <apotheon> Just give them unique primary keys -- which, by the way, is *done by definition* in PostgreSQL.
[23:09:18] <deniska> What's the point of blockchain then? Unless by blockchain you mean "signed log"

[23:41:42] <skidd0> i thought minting an NFT of an image used a hash of the image, not a URL
[23:41:46] <piou> I find that a good analogy for NFTs are "electronic baseball cards". They're a collector item referencing something (a work of art, a person, whatever) that you can own, trade, and is guaranteed to be unique
[23:41:51] <epony> and as bitcoins disappear when the rigs are killed of the power grid by police raids and army storms
[23:41:52] <[itchyjunk]> Stefan26, an object, poss sword drop, can have infinite instances to it
[23:41:57] <[itchyjunk]> the drop that `I` got.
[23:42:04] <deniska> Yeah, that's the biggest problem with NFTs. While the chain itself might be decentralized, URL points to a specific domain, owned by someone who is not you, which hosts a website which is not yours, and that website can then do whatever when you actually follow the link
[23:42:08] <[itchyjunk]> as to why it's valuable, it's valuable to `me`.
[23:42:11] <skidd0> piou: right, each card itself is unique as a 'physical' asset
[23:42:19] <skidd0> but there can be many cards of the same player
[23:42:21] <[itchyjunk]> because I got it as a drop after spending time killing it
[23:42:25] <epony> NFT is "DOI" on the hashes-trashes
[23:43:03] <piou> skidd0: that's often seen as a problem for collectors of physical objects: the rarest the better. So the fact that it's not the case with NFTs (unicity is guaranteed) is seen as a good thing in this context
