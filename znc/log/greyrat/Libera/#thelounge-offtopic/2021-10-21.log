[00:24:24] <Max-P> Experience is key for that IMO
[00:25:15] <Max-P> You can know and prevent some common patterns, but there's a whole bunch of stuff you learn by experience to know "yeah this is gonna get forgotten and it's gonna be a mess later when we do need to change this, lets build it a little more flexible to account for that"
[00:26:36] <Max-P> I try to focus on where things belong rather than where it's convenient or easy to put them
[00:28:10] <Max-P> then the second most important is repaying whatever technical debt you have ASAP. It's not economics, you can't just repay it later or have enough cash flow to sustain it, because not all code is equal unlike currency
[00:29:21] <bookworm> you'll be rewriting the whole thing in $framework of the week in JS land anyhow, who cares ;P

[01:23:37] <Max-P> That's why you say no frameworks
[01:23:53] <Max-P> And avoid npm like the plague
[01:26:09] <Max-P> Or if you must, one that's stable and on maintenance rather than fancy and brand new

[01:30:07] <Max-P> Whereas if you're using Angular you're already screwed, React's bubble will eventually pop, I don't expect Vue to be the hot thing anymore in a few years either
[01:31:50] <Max-P> Back when I started making websites, you made your own PHP framework and your own JS framework, and all of these are still working perfectly because element.getElementsByClassName() ain't going anywhere anytime soon
[01:32:33] <Max-P> The only problem is you need competent developers that are a bit more capable than copy pasting from StackOverflow or $framework documentation

[23:01:10] <johncs> Activ8: you can create channels to test on on libera. I have ##johncs registered for example, but there's no requirement for registering. It's just a bit easier to manage op status if that comes up.
[23:01:22] <Activ8> It's fine I did it
[23:01:33] <Activ8> I just created one
