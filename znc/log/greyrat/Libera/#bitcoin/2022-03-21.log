[00:06:05] <sudoforge> i mean if all of what you're doing is just for this one transaction
[00:06:10] <sudoforge> just use coinbase
[00:06:14] <sudoforge> you can send from coibase
[00:06:16] <sudoforge> coinbase
[00:06:17] <badnerd> yes just one
[00:06:38] <sudoforge> coinbase just charges trading fees; any fees you pay for sending are network fees
[00:06:42] <BUSY> how does that work - you just withdraw to your merchant as though it were your wallet?
[00:07:25] <sudoforge> i don't know how badnerd is planning on paying for it, but typically a vendor is going to have a "send your BTC to this wallet" feature for accepting payments in bitcoin
[00:07:33] <BitStonk> Don't know about Coinbase but some exchanges charge way more than what the network charges for a withdrawal

[00:08:46] <sudoforge> this can be seen by reading their documentation
[00:08:55] <BitStonk> You're telling me they're charging the actual network fee, listed here: https://mempool.space/ ?
[00:09:42] <BUSY> For transactions on cryptocurrency networks (i.e., transfers of cryptocurrency off the Coinbase platform), Coinbase incurs and pays network transaction fees (e.g., miner’s fees). We'll charge a fee based on our estimate of these network fees. In some cases, the final fee that Coinbase pays may differ from the estimated fee. All fees we charge are disclosed at the time of transaction.
[00:10:02] <BUSY> they're definitely going to mark that up
[00:10:43] <BitStonk> Most exchanges (Binance, Bitstamp) just charge a flat 0.0005 for a withdrawal, bit if a rip really but hey
[00:11:10] <BitStonk> like 1000x more than network fees :P

[00:15:06] <sudoforge> i know i've withdrawn btc from coinbase for what i see on mempool
[00:15:09] <BitStonk> You can just login to an exchange and click withdraw... I personally don't use Coinbase though so can't say on their behalf
[00:15:33] <sudoforge> i don't use coinbase for BTC or ETH, i use ftx.us -- much better fees
[00:15:39] <BUSY> perhaps they are fair - that language just sounds like ass-covering for 'estimates'
[00:15:44] <BitStonk> that's fair enough then marbe Coinbase aren't marking up the withdrawals... Fair enough to them
[00:16:07] <sudoforge> yeah based on the language it seems like they're showing you an estimated price, which you pay, but they're not _intentionally_ marking itup
[00:16:34] <BUSY> they should just let you set your own fee :D
[00:16:54] <sudoforge> but it's not your wallet you're withdrawing from ;)
[00:17:11] <BitStonk> That would be cool, although exchanges batch withdrawals and things so it'd be difficult on their end

[00:18:21] <BitStonk> Enjoy your meff
[00:19:10] <sudoforge> you're always going to have to do KYC on any exchange then (except kucoin, but i'm pretty sure they're not legally allowed to support US customers)

[00:20:10] <sudoforge> i mean, suuuuuuuure
[00:20:49] <BitStonk> What's with the elongation? :P
[00:21:16] <sudoforge> isn't there really only one or two p2p exchanges that don't require kyc? AFAIK even localbitcoins does now
[00:21:44] <BitStonk> There's loads
[00:22:17] <BitStonk> LocalCryptos, Paxful, Bisq, LocalBitcoins, AgoraDesk, errr
[00:22:23] <BitStonk> just off top of my head
[00:22:31] <sudoforge> honestly i just want a cross-chain dex that has some sort of easy onramp
[00:22:41] <sudoforge> paxful and local require kyc
[00:22:54] <sudoforge> idk about localcryptos, bisq, or agora though
[00:23:05] <BitStonk> can't have an on-ramp without bastard wanking banking unfortunately
[00:23:12] <sudoforge> right
[00:23:29] <sudoforge> but the dex doesn't need to require KYC or run that onramp directly
[00:23:58] <sudoforge> basically, i want an independent company to have an onramp in which i get whatever crypto they support directly in my wallet(s)
[00:24:01] <BitStonk> Yeah just a decentralised platform for users to chat and trade p2p
[00:24:08] <sudoforge> which is doable today, with stuff like moonpay

[20:47:24] <sudoforge> so, BTC is literally the only coin i hold that i'm not generating interest with due to a lack of non-custodial ways of doing so. is the general consensus that just keeping it on a platform like blockfi/celsius/nexo is better?
[20:50:52] <badnerd> so all i need is the bitcoin "address" of a big string of letters and numbers and i'll put that into coinbase to send $$
[20:50:54] <badnerd> yee?

[20:54:48] <sudoforge> specing: i'm well aware that.
[20:55:41] <sudoforge> badnerd: are you talking about withdrawing BTC from coinbase? then yes, you click the "send" button in the top right, enter in the bitcoin wallet address you want to send to, and voila

[22:56:36] <s17> it's easy, you and the seller make a deposit to escrow, do the trade, get your escrow back

[22:57:02] <badnerd> medi-cal sux ass
[22:57:05] <belcher> what amount do you need badnerd ?
[22:57:17] <belcher> could you buy something like an amazon gift card and then trade it online for btc
[22:57:22] <belcher> it works for small amounts
[22:57:24] <badnerd> i mean i get medication free with medi-cal my doctor just sucks balls
[22:57:29] <badnerd> i'll just wait until i see her on monday
[22:57:33] <badnerd> i have anxiety i'm afraid of running out
[22:57:39] <badnerd> everything sucks

[22:58:35] <sudoforge> how much do you need? US$80?
[22:58:54] <badnerd> it's fine ty
[22:59:10] <Ara> I think you are trying to find the easy way out and just get this done, but you need to do some research so this makes sense to you. Or use a payment method you already understand

[23:02:42] <sudoforge> badnerd, some resources:
[23:02:44] <sudoforge> - Coin Bureau (https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau/videos) - fantastic instructional content
[23:02:46] <sudoforge> - Coinbase Earn (https://www.coinbase.com/earn) - sort of useful to learn about specific networks, i guess
[23:02:48] <sudoforge> - Max Maher (https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxMaher) - breaks concepts and specific workflows down into simple steps
