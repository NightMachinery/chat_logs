[08:39:16] <corwin> I'm not sure what you mean by "directory".  I thought about flagging the user as SPAM but that seems like it would miss on-list messages from them delivered to me by email, which is more than I'm after here.  I'm just wondering if there's a "please let us know if someone is doing this" policy or some such.

[09:11:35] <Ribby> Who that be? lol
[09:12:01] <Ribby> rich himself?
[09:12:32] <corwin> Andrew Lee.  Forgive me if I decline to provide "further starter research", tho.
[09:15:32] <corwin> OK.  I wrote them again and suggested we try one further thread where we leave aside the technical point at question and work on why we feel we are/must insult each other.  In the event, I've referenced (but, I see, forgotten to link) to GNU's kind communication guidelines.  If they reply only to mock me for forgetting to attach the url I'm going to assume they "can't find them", and try to leave it at that.
[09:16:35] <corwin> Anyway, I can use my own judgment now I've the guidance there isn't some catch-all for this, independent of project.
[09:19:02] <Ribby> Hey, you're a human being. Human beings make mistakes, it's nothing to it. Least you not Mr. Lee.
[09:20:28] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[09:21:36] <corwin> I make all sorts of mistakes.  It's somewhat hard to swallow this as such, though "learning experience" I'd def grant.  In fact, it wasn't all clear the foot vote would be so successful.
[09:25:02] <corwin> From a Fosshost standpoint, the grabbing of GNU's official channels (which happened to coincide with the failure to terminate (or even censure) Eskimo for some clear racism in #freenode was the end of accepting "that was a mistake" as believable.
[09:26:02] <corwin> And then, by this point our vols had also gotten organized enough to present us with a unanimous poll of non-directors willing to say "terrible idea, stop it".
[09:26:35] <Ribby> Oh, I see that the server host have a bout with freenode's new managment. A matter of favoritism/cronyism has happened. I think that cash could be 'contributed' back to the irc host as a work of humanity.
[09:26:45] <corwin> Personally, I'd have likely stayed +O over there until I was zlined.
[09:27:15] <corwin> Ribby: we have certainly offered.  but lots of people have, dunno they want "his money".
[09:27:51] <corwin> Anyway, it's 10-20years of hosting for hundreds of projects if we are cagey, so we're being careful with it.
[09:29:07] <corwin> But again, from the Fosshost standpoint: we created a community advisory board and have agreed to review "major decisions" with that body before announcing them, going forward.  It's needing folk.
[09:31:26] *** Joins: NintendEef (~NintendEe@2600:1700:77b8:c80::148)
[09:33:01] <Ribby> Well, it doesn't have to be his money, it can be money for the development of the irc. But, if it's a legal case, then the incorporated have technically taken freenode. It's a sad fact.
[09:33:11] *** Quits: NintendEef (~NintendEe@2600:1700:77b8:c80::148) (Client Quit)
[09:35:52] <corwin> Firstly, it isn't any legal case at least so far aware of or member to as a party to the charity.  Beyond that, frankly, it isn't IRCs money.  It belongs to us now.  And our stated (and UK CIC registered) mission is to provide hosting for projects we a decent "Free" or "open-source" license.  But yeah, several of us are IRC nerds; I suspect spending/sending xxxxxxxx on/toward that 
[09:36:47] *** Joins: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka)
[09:36:48] <corwin> I mean, it's something I'd personally support, but now we have to bring our community advisors so I'm less in position to personally decide that than I was when we received the donations, etc.
[09:38:12] <jxself> Maybe a discussion of Fosshost's decisions, money, and etc. would be most appropriate in their IRC channel(s)?
[09:38:41] <corwin> Sorry to bore/frustrate you, jxself.  I'll move aLong.
[09:39:48] <jxself> Not bored or frustrated at all. Just seem mostly Fosshost decision and governance matters.

[09:42:50] <corwin> Well.. in an attempt to "tie the room together" then, let me add: as an free software contributer invested in "open standards", as well as kind communication, the whole thing is quite a learning experience.  I'll be glad to have a few trusted community members consider what things should really be secret, as we are slower to announce "big deal" plans to our community.

[20:37:15] <lfam> Hello, I'm having some trouble understanding time zone conversions when using `date` from coreutils. When I say "conversion", I'm trying to use the command to answer the question "If it's noon in another continent, what time is it here?"
[20:37:40] <lfam> Specifically, I get inconsistent results when specifying the remote time zone as CET vs UTC+1, although I think they should be equivalent
[20:37:49] <lfam> Here's an example of what I see: <https://paste.debian.net/1229800/>
[20:38:02] <lfam> Can anybody help me understand this? Am I doing it wrong? Or is it a bug?
[20:39:23] <lfam> It's as if the "sign", positive or negative, is reversed from what I expected

[20:46:27] <gustaf> very strange 
[20:47:01] <gustaf> I read somewhere that US convention is to count timezones West of Greenwich as positive 
[20:47:47] <lfam> It's certainly strange... I still wonder if I'm using it wrong
[20:47:57] <lfam> Can you reproduce it, gustaf?
[20:50:58] <gustaf> yes
[20:51:28] <gustaf> the info page states positive values are supposed to east of Greenwich

[20:54:56] <lfam> Huh
[20:55:11] <lfam> So... what do people use to convert time zones?
[20:55:44] <gustaf> section 21.1.6, but that has a full ISO 8661 format 
[20:55:52] <gustaf> not the TZ=UTC format

[20:57:42] <lfam> I've gotten bad info from Google before, now I got bad info from `date`
[20:57:54] <lfam> Wondering how to do this reliably
[21:02:02] <gustaf> I just scraped a bunch of info from time.is
[21:02:49] <gustaf> timeanddate.com is a decent website with ok info
[21:03:08] <lfam> Thanks
[21:03:16] <lfam> It's a shame the GNU tool doesn't work well

[21:21:19] <ede> yeah, i needed some time to fiddle out things like the difference between two dates and the like.
[21:21:49] <ede> i convert to Epoch and then normal math is possible
[21:23:01] <ede> @ +/- : my files all are +0100 or 0200 depending on CE(S)T

[22:45:12] <euouae> Hello, how can I contribute to find from findutils? Is it a cvs repo or a git repo they have? I don't understand if the info on the gnu page is up to date... there's https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/findutils
[22:47:41] *** Quits: Kruppt (~Kruppt@50-111-52-16.drhm.nc.frontiernet.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:53:17] <jxself> I don't know that the maintainers of GNU Findutils hang out here; you may have better luck on the mailing list.
[22:53:54] <jxself> But just from looking at Savannah I see a git repository there.
[22:54:00] <jxself> THey'd also have CVS for the website.
[22:54:35] <euouae> so if they have a git in savannah does it mean I can mail a patch?
[22:54:53] <jxself> Git technically allows that, yes.
[22:54:58] <jxself> But does a project accept those?
[22:55:04] <euouae> I don't know
[22:55:10] <jxself> Please check with the Findutils documentation to see.
[22:55:50] <jxself> I'm looking at the "How to Get Help" section on the Findutils page.
[22:56:26] <euouae> the findutils page has some broken links
[22:56:56] <jxself> The mailing list one does not appear to be one of them though.
[22:56:56] <euouae> the release notes look more up to date, https://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=10108
[22:57:29] <jxself> So that's my advice: Hop on to the mailing list and talk to the people that actually work on Findutils because I don't think they hang out here.
[22:57:48] <euouae> got it, thanks
[22:58:32] <euouae> it was a bit easier with gnu parted earlier today because they use git
[22:58:44] <euouae> I found small typos in the info pages
