[04:35:48] <zaeph> Heya.
[04:36:46] <alphapapa[m]> Realized I hadn't yet joined this channel.  :)  Looking forward to the conf.  Not meaning to pester, but I just wanted to offer again to help with updating the poster if you'd like to use it.  I hope it can be of use this time around, since I offered it late in the process last year.
[04:38:08] <zaeph> alphapapa[m]: We've got a little bit of respite now that the CFP is launched, so I'll have a look at updating the visuals next Saturday.  We can probably feature your poster or elements of it on the main page for 2021.
[04:38:51] <alphapapa[m]> Thanks.
[04:52:27] <corwin> office hours may start a few minutes late this evening.  I'll be happy to hang out a few minutes after the top of the next hour if we're still going strong :D
[04:52:59] <corwin> alphapapa[m]: thanks for making with the pretty!
[04:53:25] <alphapapa[m]> corwin: haha :)
[04:53:38] <alphapapa[m]> I'm no graphic designer but Inkscape isn't too hard to work with
[04:54:11] *** Quits: GNUHacker (~gnu@fsf/member/GNUHacker) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:59:01] <corwin> tbh, it's precious hard to get graphic design of any kind or quality in/for FOSS projects.  Or maybe just those folks are more on the open-source side of the world?
[05:01:07] <alphapapa[m]> Maybe matters of taste are at issue, too.  If a designer makes something for free in his spare time, but then some coder actually running the project doesn't like it, well, then what?  They probably won't contribute again, because to them, their expertise in graphic design has been rejected by someone without similar expertise.  At least, I imagine that has happened in many projects.
[05:01:11] <zaeph> Rude!  I spend ages on those logos: https://paste.xinu.at/Q5DC/
[05:01:15] <zaeph> spent*, even.
[05:01:43] <alphapapa[m]> Cool, I didn't know you made those, Leo.  Very nice, especially the Roam one.
[05:02:19] <alphapapa[m]> I mean, not bad for an English major, anyway :P  lol j/k
[05:02:19] <zaeph> Thanks!  I dabble in typography and graphic design.
[05:02:50] <alphapapa[m]> A true renaissance man, a generalist.
[05:03:18] <corwin> hehehe
[05:03:55] <zaeph> alphapapa[m]: My initials aren't 'LV' for nothing. ;)
[05:03:56] <corwin> I mean the renaissance man comment is spot on.  the not bad for eng maj comment is Hilarius!
[05:04:50] <alphapapa[m]> zaeph: I'm afraid that one whooshed on me, but I recall lv being an Emacs package as well...
[05:05:16] <alphapapa[m]> corwin: Thanks, I'll be here...well, until the fish run out, at least
[05:05:58] <zaeph> alphapapa[m]: Leonardo da Vinci!
[05:06:07] <alphapapa[m]> ahhh I was just about to say that and then you said it first :)
[05:06:17] <alphapapa[m]> just took me a little while
[05:06:40] <alphapapa[m]> I might start calling you "da Vi" or something from now on ;)
[05:07:47] <zaeph> I'll always admire people who make a point of shortening either my first name or my nick; the former is three letters, and the latter is 5 letters for just one syllable.
[05:08:17] <zaeph> I should probably go to bed now before I completely drift to Honolyly.
[05:08:20] <zaeph> Ref: https://xkcd.com/448/
[05:08:26] <zaeph> Honolulu*, even.
[05:12:11] <alphapapa[m]> I guess in 50 years (or much less) we'll all have VR goggles strapped to our faces 24/7 and live in virtual societies with random people around the world who share common interests, and our sleep schedules will be entirely unsynchronized with people in our physical vicinity.
[05:12:46] <corwin> sounds fine tbh
[05:13:40] <alphapapa[m]> The Matrix cometh.
[05:13:55] <alphapapa[m]> I mean, yeah, it'll be fine, except for the catheters... ;)
[05:15:02] <sachac> In 15 minutes: EmacsConf Office Hour - see https://bbb.emacsverse.org/b/ban-qye-fd1-5kw for details
[05:16:03] <corwin> smart money says apple has a propriety cath controller interface 1st and *everyone* needs it.
[05:17:33] <alphapapa[m]> And then a few years later they add an "entitlement" permission that you need to request for the ability to remove the catheter yourself...
[05:18:46] <alphapapa[m]> I don't have a cam or mic set up right now, can I just watch the office hours?
[05:19:29] <corwin> absolutely!
[05:20:09] <corwin> that's not uncommon that a few people "just watch" or chat only
[05:21:20] <alphapapa[m]> thanks
[05:21:39] <alphapapa[m]> Do you do this office hours thing weekly?
[05:22:23] <corwin> i'm doing 2 on weekday evenings (per US.Central) and Leo's doing one each sat
[05:22:48] <corwin> so tue/fri/sat
[05:22:49] <zaeph> We've got a calendar for them and workgroups, too: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Usergroups
[05:23:48] <alphapapa[m]> y'all are really sharp for doing this in your free time :) a true labor of love
[05:28:25] <zaeph> alphapapa[m]: Thanks!  We all try to pitch in what we can.
[05:30:02] <sachac> Starting now: EmacsConf Office Hour - see https://emacsconf.org/2021/office-hours/ for details
[05:30:40] <corwin> I'll be about 3m late it looks like.
