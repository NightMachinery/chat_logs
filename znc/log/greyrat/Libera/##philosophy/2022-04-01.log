[07:31:17] <ro-bot-o> Bakunin meant to say: I rescind the recommendation, specifically, from you
[07:32:33] <causative> to translate, you're suggesting that because supposedly "strong evidence" would not refute my position, then I must be "not even wrong."
[07:32:48] <causative> but you're missing the point, that the supposedly strong evidence you are providing is completely unrelated to my point
[07:33:01] <causative> it's allegedly strong, *irrelevant* evidence
[07:33:14] <Bakunin> no you just look like a pseudointellectual who's trying to argue over nothing
[07:33:26] <Bakunin> your points support the book's central thesis
[07:33:43] <causative> and you've insulted me
[07:34:16] <Bakunin> yes, I've made my citation, you haven't read it and are making hilarious assumptions about it which ironically prove its points
[07:34:43] <Bakunin> if you gor hurt fee fees, its cuz you chat like that
[07:34:57] <causative> so you claim; and the best way to support your claim, apparently, is to insult me and say I must be generally wrong without providing a single shred of direct refutation
[07:35:08] <Bakunin> the number of papers you've written is zero.
[07:35:16] <causative> that's not true
[07:35:23] <Bakunin> you are an expert in nothing, in no field, and in no capacity.
[07:35:29] <causative> also not true
[07:35:41] <Bakunin> it's evident.
[07:35:49] <causative> oh good
[07:36:01] <Bakunin> you are afraid to even guess what to say you know anything about
[07:36:27] <causative> it's not really your business what I do, nor is it relevant whatsoever to Thomas Kuhn
[07:36:31] <Bakunin> is it python-related
[07:36:53] <Bakunin> it absolutely is, if you want to talk about your dumbass theories without even reading a summary of the book :)
[07:36:59] <Bakunin> I'll defend Kuhn in here
[07:37:03] <causative> you haven't done so yet
[07:37:10] <Bakunin> Happy to do so, big dummy
[07:37:15] <causative> then do it
[07:37:19] <audrey> *facepalm*
[07:37:27] <causative> anyway, I haven't attacked Kuhn per se, as I was telling you earlier
[07:37:41] <causative> I only said something about why *physicists* tend not to endorse those ideas
[07:38:00] <Bakunin> yeah, you're Not Even Wrong.  The points you guessed out loud about people not liking being challenged are ...
[07:38:10] <Bakunin> What the book is fucking all about
[07:38:31] <Bakunin> sorta like banning To Kill a Mockingbird because "it makes me uncomfortable" lol
[07:38:42] <causative> and I take it you endorse the book? so it follows from this, that you endorse what I've said?
[07:39:03] <Bakunin> ...
[07:39:15] <Bakunin> no
[07:39:23] <Bakunin> you're not even wrong, yet again
[07:39:24] <causative> no, of course not, because everything must fit into the "my side good your side bad" narrative.
[07:39:43] <causative> no nuances allowed
[07:39:45] <Bakunin> do you know some x=y does not imply all y=x?
[07:39:53] <Bakunin> probably not, you're not an expert in anything
[07:39:53] <causative> I do know that
[07:40:09] <Bakunin> thats your arg rn
[07:40:17] <Bakunin> this is boring
[07:40:22] <Bakunin> read Kuhn or don't, kid
[07:40:32] <Bakunin> pls stop guessing out loud badly as a troll in here
[07:40:49] <mycroftiv> all those kidders, throw em down a well
[07:40:59] <mycroftiv> we know what they been up to
[07:41:22] <causative> Bakunin, do you understand I am not arguing at the moment that Kuhn is wrong?
[07:41:26] <Bakunin> causative is some shitweasel in a wheelchair in PotatoesVille Idaho with a TTY
[07:42:09] <causative> you understand that, in accordance with all I've said, Kuhn could be entirely right, and yet physicists in general disagree with him, for reasons that I have stated and that Kuhn himself describes in his book?
[07:43:58] <Bakunin> they dont
[07:44:05] <Bakunin> so no, I do not understand
[07:44:24] <Bakunin> you went from declaring the landscape to suggesting a possibility
[07:44:29] <Bakunin> I guess thatls an L
[07:45:05] <causative> I mentioned the Sokal affair as a specific example of physicists critical of the legacy of Kuhn
[07:45:14] <causative> here's another physicists critical of Kuhn:  https://web.physics.utah.edu/~detar/phys4910/readings/fundamentals/weinberg.html

[07:49:18] <causative> here's a quora post asking for anyone to cite a prominent physicists who has defended Kuhn, with no one providing any names of physicists:  https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-prominent-physicists-who-have-defended-Kuhns-definition-of-science-and-scientific-progress
[07:49:18] <ro-bot-o> [url] Are there any prominent physicists who have defended Kuhn's definition of science and scientific progress? - Quora | www.quora.com
[07:50:35] <causative> this would be evidence that there are few if any physicists publicly in support of Kuhn, and at least two publicly critical of Kuhn
[07:52:01] <causative> and the reasons are as I stated:  people get into physics because they hope to discover the secret truths of the universe, and would therefore be strongly initially biased against anyone telling them they aren't doing that
[07:52:48] <Bakunin> heh
[07:53:05] <Bakunin> this is absolutely the sort of bodged human he wrote about
[07:53:06] <Bakunin> "Kuhn made the shift from one paradigm to another seem more like a religious conversion than an exercise of reason."
[07:53:17] <Bakunin> YES, YES PRECISELY, YOU DUMBASS
[07:53:41] <Bakunin> Did he write that from the Sir Isaac Newton institute, one wonders
[07:53:42] <causative> <causative> you understand that, in accordance with all I've said, Kuhn could be entirely right, and yet physicists in general disagree with him, for reasons that I have stated and that Kuhn himself describes in his book?
[07:54:09] <causative> you're repeating my own point back at me and adding an insult to it, as if it was your point?
[07:56:00] <Bakunin> its hilarious

[07:58:35] <mrdata> hawking?
[07:58:42] <mrdata> anyone else
[08:00:10] <causative> there's a kind of social contract of debate, where you agree not to insult the other person, you agree to a kind of presumptive equality where what you say demands as much proof as what he says
[08:00:37] <causative> you agree to a mutual obligation to behave reasonably, to keep a level head and respond point by point
[08:01:38] <causative> sadly, the number of people who are willing to accept this kind of implicit social contract is not high; it's much more popular to identify the person disagreeing with you as "the enemy" and deny him all courtesy

[18:31:25] <Delf> When you see your own value, you can notice others seeing their own value too and when you do not engage in disruptive, dishonorable and insincere methods yet others do, you notice them not seeing their own value. This is hardly anything to take personally. How can someone whom does not honor themselves, honor you? That's asking for too much mate.

[20:43:47] <arryana> not really
[20:44:24] <arryana> in the states, you can really only get italian sausages (sweet, mild, and hot) and breakfast sausages, which are usually pork based.
[20:44:32] <pussipupu> nor Finland, I miss them
[20:44:32] <arryana> there's a lot less breadcrumb in them, compared to uk ones
[20:44:49] <arryana> when i'm here i miss the american ones, when i'm there i miss the english ones
[20:45:05] <pussipupu> yeah, makes sense
[20:45:31] <pussipupu> here I crave bacon and sausage breakfast sandwiches
[20:45:37] <arryana> but i'm one of those savages who likes them cooked brown and crispy
[20:45:45] <arryana> oh man

[21:16:17] <arryana> me too.  leeks are in season, and i like it without cheese, really simple
[21:16:21] <arryana> i add avocado instead
[21:17:23] <arryana> the base is either chicken stock or vegetable broth from whatever bits and leftovers i've got.

[21:22:44] <mycroftiv> and as often, i am grateful for this channel directing my mind toward what is healthy
[21:23:50] <pussipupu> I don't think I've ever bought an omelette, I like them though
[21:24:55] <mycroftiv> i cook eggs for myself a lot but something about the community connection of the local greasy spoon has always made it about a lot more than just the food for me
[21:26:17] <mycroftiv> a lot of natural feeling connection with the world feels like it slipped away past few years and along with exciting new possibilities, i like the day to day simplicity of life a lot when it exists
