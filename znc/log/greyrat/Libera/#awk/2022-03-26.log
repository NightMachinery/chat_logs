[01:43:42] <acidsys> hi there, I am trying to remove a "⏎" line break character using awk. I tried a few gsub replacements with \n and \r but they do not seem to catch it. The character is produced by the input string, not by awk itself. Does someone happen to have an idea?
[01:43:51] <acidsys> here's the full snippet if someone wants to take a look https://pasta.lysergic.dev/?e2831deef8686c13#EFSm8cTSHddGgHyzzZWXcg7uns9zs97XUSUZmy2wV128

[02:00:49] <tirnanog> acidsys: what's shown in the paste is the UTF-8 encoding of RETURN SYMBOL (U+23CE). not \r, \n or anything else.
[02:01:41] *** Quits: user51 (~user51@77.124.35.94) (Quit: leaving)
[02:02:15] <tirnanog> you could use it in your expression as-is. or, if you prefer, the representation of the UTF-8 bytes in octal, which is \342\217\216.

[02:06:54] <acidsys> ohh thank you very much tirnanog, I actually did try just copying the symbol but it did not help. thanks for the octal code!! that's very helpful
[02:07:16] <acidsys> it sort of still shows in the shell, but redirecting to a file does not contain it, so I guess that's good enough
[02:07:36] <tirnanog> note, also:
[02:07:38] <tirnanog> # printf %s ⏎ | od -An -t o1
[02:07:39] <shbot> tirnanog:  342 217 216
[02:08:10] <tirnanog> (obviously I'm directly pasting the UTF-8 bytes in the above example, as the operand for printf)

[02:27:48] <acidsys> I can't believe I did not know about `od`
