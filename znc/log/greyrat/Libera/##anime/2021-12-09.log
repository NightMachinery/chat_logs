[00:04:27] <MootPoot> I have like 5 of those cheap chinese arms
[00:04:34] <Bco1981> speaking of... i just found the squirt game... episode 1...
[00:04:34] <MootPoot> its the bases which fail over time
[00:04:37] <MootPoot> lmaooooo
[00:05:25] <Bco1981> hm... chinese audio
[00:05:45] <MootPoot> well, its just the arms
[00:05:52] <MootPoot> I have 2 for my soldering/electornics workbench
[00:05:55] <ButterNoodle> jfc give em back.. cant work without arms...

[00:06:14] <MootPoot> and another for my mic
[00:06:27] <MootPoot> others are in storage - dont need em atm
[00:08:07] <MootPoot> my MSI laptop is literally falling apart
[00:08:07] <MootPoot> lmao
[00:08:10] <MootPoot> its been 5 years
[00:08:16] <MootPoot> plastic cracking
[00:08:25] <MootPoot> I guess that's to be expected from a laptop
[00:09:13] <Bco1981> you should be more gentle with it,
[00:09:35] <isekaijin> Most laptops suck.
[00:09:35] <MootPoot> its just the hinges and the joint points
[00:09:40] <MootPoot> I didnt bang it around 
[00:09:50] <isekaijin> And if you find a laptop that doesn't suck, chances are it's more expensive than a desktop PC that doesn't suck.
[00:09:51] <Bco1981> isekaijin: yeah... they do have a fan.
[00:09:59] <MootPoot> the glue around the hinges is seperating
[00:10:28] <MootPoot> I had to take off the plastic cover of the hinge
[00:10:36] <MootPoot> otherwise it wouldnt close anymore
[00:10:39] <ButterNoodle> I want a laptop that sucks
[00:10:53] <MootPoot> get usb onahole
[00:10:55] <ButterNoodle> most seem too thin to accommodate
[00:11:08] <MootPoot> I might install arch on it
[00:11:18] <MootPoot> installing win11 on it killed the touchpad - no work anymore
[00:11:24] <MootPoot> or borked drivers idk
[00:11:38] <MootPoot> it was too old for win11 anyway - through the legit upgrade
[00:11:51] <MootPoot> or use silverblue like some kind of anime character
[00:13:11] <Nanobot> MC is a shy girl who likes a boy in her school. One day, she confesses to him, but he just looks down and says, "No. Ugly." MC is heartbroken at first, but then she decides to work on improving her appearance until there's no way he could say no. She becomes exceptionally beautiful, and she leaves a note in his locker to meet her behind the gym. But, when he shows up, MC is surprised to see that he has also given himself a makeover and somehow looks like 
[00:13:11] <Nanobot> an even more beautiful girl than her. He apologizes for being too ugly before and asks if MC will still go out with him now.

[00:23:08] <Satin> what are "multi gpu"
[00:23:16] <Satin> MootPoot: yes, that's quite literally why I'm not using arch.
[00:23:22] <Satin> and using popOS instead on this laptop.
[00:23:28] <MootPoot> rip
[00:23:29] <Satin> it's possible on other distros
[00:23:31] <Satin> but
[00:23:33] <MootPoot> you cant say you use arch

[00:23:39] <Satin> it's sad.
[00:23:47] <HeTo> hm, that Steam breakage that uninstalls your dekstop if you're adventurous enough to let it do that casts some serious doubt on their QA processes

[00:24:22] <Satin> I don't want to deal with the risk of it randomly not working out 
[00:24:23] <HeTo> it should never have gotten to the point where it's in the stable version

[00:24:29] <buZz> yeah debian and derivatives have it pretty simple

[00:24:37] <Satin> have it setup for this stuff.

[00:24:43] <HeTo> unless Linus went out of his way to get the beta/alpha version or something
[00:24:45] <MootPoot> can popos pop my gpu
[00:24:46] <Satin> They care.
[00:24:50] <MootPoot> or can pop os pop my cherry
[00:25:11] <buZz> HeTo: only lesson from linus that everyone can use is 'read warning messages'
[00:25:23] <MootPoot> Is there any other distro with nvidia crap built in?
[00:25:28] <Poeticode> use amd and you're good to go
[00:25:36] <Bco1981> MootPoot: manjaro
[00:25:56] <Satin> I wouldn't go with manjaro if i were you

[00:29:03] <Satin> but i've used distros like endevourOS (formerly antergos
[00:29:04] <Satin> )
[00:29:09] <Satin> that don't modify arch as much as manjaro does

[04:12:22] <Fenderbassist> they at least know what you are capable of

[09:19:21] <mathu> Satin: have you looked into coding bootcamps as an alternative to the college track you were on?
[09:19:22] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri_: tbh I don't have much experience with python
[09:19:33] <MootPoot> More on JS and PHP
[09:19:52] <MootPoot> Probably where my distaste comes from
[09:19:56] <PancakeMatsuri_> MootPoot nicer than JS
[09:20:38] <MootPoot> It's a weird mix for my 
[09:20:39] <MootPoot> Me 
[09:20:41] <mathu> i've been learning rust lately, i think it's a steeper learning curve than python but there's some python-like readability and flow to it which is interesting
[09:20:53] <PancakeMatsuri_> Satin having seen GTK from the C side, it's a lot of hassle
[09:21:02] <MootPoot> The thing is , if I'm doing a desktop app I might as well use C# which I'm best at 
[09:21:04] <MootPoot> Overall 
[09:21:14] <PancakeMatsuri_> Satin you could use Python bindings or Electron
[09:21:20] <Satin> I don't like python, though to be fair i haven't looked into it much. identation driven stuff just feels wrong rn lmao
[09:21:24] <MootPoot> But if I'm doing a browser thing might as well use JS since it runs in the browser 
[09:21:31] <Satin> It feels like something I can just look up the libraries for if i need to actually work with it
[09:21:41] <MootPoot> Python is in a weird spot for me 
[09:22:00] * MootPoot also dosent like weakly typed languages 
[09:22:03] <PancakeMatsuri_> well, it's got libraries
[09:22:07] <MootPoot> Am I the boomer?
[09:22:16] <mathu> c# was really nice for the beginner/intermediate-level project i did with it. asp.net web framework docs were impenetrable until you found someone who was Initiated and could explain it in english instead of java but the language itself was really nice
[09:22:22] <Satin> mathu: I've not - and I'm not even sure I want to work in the tech industry which I'm not a big fan of at all, directly as much as something that can apply CS I've learned in school with it
[09:22:26] <Satin> (re: bootcamps)
[09:22:43] <ewong> Satin I struggle with C
[09:22:57] <Satin> ewong: so do I, but it's fun
[09:23:10] <Satin> though I'm not doing really low level stuff or anything yet
[09:23:27] <MootPoot> mathu: that's a common problem with most docs unfortunately , the Linux manpages too - they only make sense if you already know what you're doing
[09:23:54] <mathu> Satin: what do you think you're looking to do? (plenty of coding jobs aren't in "the tech industry" if you mean what i think you mean by that)
[09:24:00] <MootPoot> Hurr durr read the docs / RFTM dosent help when you have no way to contextualize the information
[09:24:53] <mathu> MootPoot: i might be able to make sense of the MS stack stuff if i tried it now, but at the time it was markedly more different than the other languages and frameworks i'd learned. i think django and cakephp at the time, as well as language docs for a few languages
[09:24:56] <ewong> Satin:  it's fun when you understand it fully..  and when you can hack yourself around C code and do it securely.
[09:25:56] <mathu> i think learning c is probably valuable and there will always be c code and c jobs but i really do think the industry needs to push hard to leave it behind
[09:26:16] <Satin> Yeah, I realize it's not good for actually producing useful things with. I'm mainly attached to it for the learning stuff.
[09:27:34] <Satin> mathu: also not sure to be honest what exactly. I just meant to convey I prefer a CS degree at university, even if at this point I'm going to be behind by some years thanks to weird circumstances like skipping a semester at community college before I transferred to a uni hundreds of miles away, and then getting almost murdered right before spring 2021 semester, and then now .. this semester has been a bit of a tough one to live out.
[09:27:58] <Satin> Bioinformatics looks interesting.
[09:28:13] <mathu> Satin: i see. gotcha
[09:28:32] <MootPoot> Soon satin might end up farming or something
[09:28:34] <Satin> bootcamps feel more heavily oriented towards developers
[09:28:40] <amigojapan> mathu: Linux is basically mostly C, it would be hard to leave behind
[09:29:35] <mathu> Satin: i asked because some bootcamps are actually run by universities + you'd get to skip gen eds and focus on the coding stuff which might be easier to balance with less context switching. but yeah if you're looking at getting into research-y fields having a degree is probably better than a vague certification
[09:29:55] <Satin> gotcha, that's very true.
[09:31:01] <mathu> Satin: fwiw i was a developer at a physics lab; if by "tech industry" you meant "companies with a morally complicated role in society" there are tons and tons of coding/dev jobs that aren't that. i worked on an intranet site for scheduling lab tours and recording timesheets. everyone needs devs
[09:31:54] <mathu> Satin: for non-dev roles, there are data science bootcamps too if you want something more researchy, but those would probably be heavier on the stats than the coding
[09:32:22] <mathu> sticking with a degree is fine too, i'll stop preaching lol
[09:32:26] <Satin> yeah for sure. I just mean big tech + any major software development company in general selling technology products/services these days. I'm aware I might end up working for one for a while anyways, assuming I graduate at all lol but still.
[09:32:29] <Satin> i getcha
[09:33:00] <Satin> I'm at a school I really like, which I consider relatively difficult and all of that, I just need to get it together and kickstart actually getting through these courses
[09:33:20] <mathu> it do be like that
[09:33:25] <Satin> I transferred in right in the middle of a pandemic, with online schooling everywhere, and then that stuff happened right before the spring so I haven't gotten settled yet.
[09:33:49] <mathu> as i always say feel free to hilight me here if you have qs or want to talk shop, but i think you have other people to talk to

[09:41:21] <Satin> they could either be doing it because they just want to really add you as a friend on there, or because they assume they can't contact you without doing that

[09:53:55] <PancakeMatsuri_> MootPoot you got called at 3am?
[09:53:56] <MootPoot> Old internship, they were really into that whole extra work think 
[09:53:58] <mathu> Satin: are you learning by tutorial or do you ahve an idea of a project you're trying to build?
[09:54:08] <Satin> latter
[09:54:15] <mathu> cool cool
[09:54:20] <Satin> there are almost no tutorials for GTK4
[09:54:28] <MootPoot> So the manager left early while I was down in the slums working 
[09:54:30] <Satin> and the one or two that are there are very basic stuff
[09:54:30] <mathu> there's a gtk4?
[09:54:33] <Satin> yes.
[09:54:37] <Satin> and apparently a gtk 4.6
[09:54:39] <Satin> upcoming
[09:54:42] <mathu> wao
[09:54:43] <MootPoot> I called her up at 9pm to ask for more work :D
[09:54:47] <MootPoot> She was mad at me 
[09:54:53] <MootPoot> Then I quoted her line back to her 
[09:55:00] <Satin> and people are mad at gtk to some degree because they keep breaking shit in between minor developmental cycles with the intensity of these changes, and all the wayland stuff
[09:55:06] <MootPoot> About working extra for a career
[09:55:17] <Satin> but yeah, gtk4 is solidly different than before in many ways.
[09:55:19] <MootPoot> Never asked me to work after 430 again 
[09:56:22] * Satin has had a lot of fun reading in between the lines, looking up demos code in the gitlab repo, asking on the irc sometimes, and digging through the docs most of the time smh
[09:56:23] <mathu> interesting. we did MFC for windows desktop apps in one of my college classes but i've otherwise never looked at desktop frameworks
[09:56:32] <MootPoot> Where the fuck is Sadale these days
[09:56:38] <Satin> i made a Qt account and donwloaded it, then C++ scared me away instantly
[09:56:40] <Satin> no thanks
[09:56:43] <Satin> !seen Sadale
[09:56:43] <ImoutoBot> Satin: Sadale was last seen in ##anime 15 hours and 40 minutes ago: <Sadale> buy another USB pendrive lulz
[09:56:54] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale is probably working
[09:56:55] <mathu> yeah... i think c++ is just a better language than C, but it's a fuckin mess
[09:56:56] <Satin> MootPoot: probably alive when you're asleep
[09:57:56] <Satin> mathu: I got two As in community college for intro to programming and OOP (both which were not great at all, and which i don't claim to know, and I retook those classes at my current school, rightly, as this school's intro uses C and has linked lists and pointers in the first class...far more better)
[09:58:09] <Satin> both used C++, and I felt lost most of the time
[09:58:18] <mathu> c++ is like, a better language when you know how to use it. but if you don't know how to use it, it's impenetrable. there's also a biiiig difference between "classroom c++" which you get in class + tutorials and "modern c++" which would be used in real codebases. also qt i think has a lot of language extensions and stuff
[09:58:18] <Satin> not by the syntax necessarily but it was so unsatisfying
[09:58:31] <Satin> like even cout and cin feel............complicated than how they look
[09:58:40] <Satin> printf makes very direct sense to me lol.
[09:58:49] <mathu> even in c++ code i still use printf haha

[09:59:10] <mathu> i even metaprogrammed a type-safe wrapper around printf so you don't need the %s and %d anymore
[09:59:27] <Satin> it's not that I can't learn my way through it, but it doesn't feel right at all to me. I'm a very bottoms-up person for technical stuff.
[09:59:37] <MootPoot> I too like bottoms up
[09:59:43] <Satin> bottom-up*
[09:59:44] <MootPoot> Butt first 
[09:59:47] * Satin slaps MootPoot to space 
[09:59:50] <Satin> yes
[09:59:55] * MootPoot goes to space butt first 
[10:00:18] <mathu> well, i use printf for debugging. you never see printf or cout in Real Codebases, you see ILoggerIface::Write(Level::INFO, "opening window {}", window.name);
[10:00:21] <Satin> C++ sounds powerful once you know what you're doing lol, I'm not excited to learn through it, C is nicer
[10:00:47] <Satin> Even the pointers part. It makes sense when you follow it painstakingly closely
[10:00:51] <mathu> C is a much much simpler language. sort of for that reason i don't think it should be used for new serious projects, period

[10:09:16] <Nanobot> move your king. 7. They're going to capture either your rook or a pawn. Let them take the rook, because the pawn is your last chance to get your queen back. 8. Now your pawn is blocked. Dammit. 9. You now have a king, a pawn, a knight, and rook, and a bishop, while the opponent still has most of their major pieces. Time to start doing some trades. 10. You now have just a king and a blocked pawn. Keep moving your king is circles; you'll eventually tire out

[10:44:48] <Satin> HeTo: for me personally bottom up just means something i can concretely feel like I'm understanding the basis of, like for basic algebra and trig and such, it's in front of me.
[10:45:13] <Satin> HeTo: it doesn't feel that way when i learn calculus in most college classes and am handed tools to use  (and for good reason obviously, acutally understanding the stuff is real analysis but still)
[10:45:22] <Satin> so, very relative definition of bottom up lol
[10:45:53] <HeTo> Satin: and you'd get closer to that faster with C++. don't confuse the implementation of some concept with a description of what that concept does
[10:45:56] <Satin> someone else might find c++ bottom up and i'd happily understand how, for me nah. C++ simply doesn't feel as a beginner like it makes obvious sense.
[10:46:00] <mathu> Satin: i think sircmpwn just likes to complain. his notion of tier 1 targets etc in the second article is a list that the Rust project maintains, because they are aware of the practical reality that they don't have resources to achieve the same hardware support breadth in 5 years that C has in 40
[10:46:02] <Satin> C on the other hand does, often. 
[10:46:53] <Satin> mathu: even though I'm clearly not informed on the topic here, from the tone and phrasing, and the reasoning given, - yes, seems very much like he's about nitpicking/being overtly cynical about it
[10:46:57] <mathu> Satin: there's a chicken-and-egg problem with these things: the core team can't justify investing in tier-2 architectures without some assurance that their work will actually be used, but it's hard for tier-2 architecture users to adopt rust if the support isn't robust

[10:50:31] <Satin> HeTo: isn't it OOP and not as much procedural? 
[10:51:24] <mathu> HeTo: i disagree that C++ allows for more bottom-up learning. you need to learn so much about the language in addition to learning to program. i have to imagine malloc, free, and sizeof in C are easier to learn than move semantics, the rule of 5, type resolution rules...
[10:52:19] <HeTo> Satin: not to mention you're doing OOP anyway. just because you say struct instead of class and you do my_class_some_operation(MyClass* self) and not my_class::some_operation() and base_class->some_function = my_some_function; instead of some_function() override doesn't make it not object-oriented

[11:03:01] <mathu> HeTo: i think my stance is: even if you're good at writing a C++ learning resource, you can only pray that the reader follows it to the letter through to the end of the book before branching out, and if you want them to be able to successfully and independently write modern c++ at the end of it the book would have to be 2000 pages long

[11:03:44] <HeTo> mathu: why so much for modern C++ when even old C++ didn't require nearly that much?
[11:04:23] <HeTo> mathu: teaching C++ as a layer "first we had C, then C++98 added this, then C++11 added this" is the wrong way to go about it
[11:05:33] <mathu> HeTo: i think we might just be setting a "done" bar differently
[11:07:27] <HeTo> mathu: granted, that Stroustrup book is slightly over 1000 pages long, but there's probably stuff there about understanding older C++ and C code, not all modern C++ (althuogh since there is existing code out there, it is important that there is something on that as well of course)
[11:07:29] <mathu> HeTo: it's been 10y since i approached c++ as a true beginner but making a guess based on learning resources for other languages: if you branch out and try to work on something independently after finishing your learning resource, the odds that you'll encounter a problem you're wholly unequipped to handle are vastly higher in C++ than for other languages

[11:10:37] <ImoutoBot> [title] Effective Modern C++ [Book]
[11:12:50] <mathu> i should probably tone down my rhetoric here because i think the crucial thing is that someone pick something and stick with it, and if they pick C++ i'm happy to try to explain the impenetrable bullshit that they stumble into :P
[11:13:27] <mathu> but C is vastly simpler. i think C++ has a lot more in it to protect you from mistakes, but the mistakes get way way more complicated
[11:15:00] <HeTo> Satin: anyway, C++ is a multi-paradigm language. you can do OOP in it, but you don't have to; the only place in the standard library with virtual functions is the iostreams library. it also supports generic programming, you can program in it in functional style (and it's getting better at supporting that with new versions), and of course it supports procedural programming - it is after all not too difficult 
[11:15:06] <HeTo> to program in the common subset of C and C++ if you're so inclined
[11:15:14] <HeTo> I mean, not too difficult compared to programming in C
[11:16:54] <HeTo> with virtual functions in the standard library I mean a place that's specified to have virtual functions. there are probably virtual functions in implementations in places like std::function, but that is up to the implementation
[11:17:05] <HeTo> oh and I suppose the error category stuff has virtual functions too

[11:21:32] <HeTo> less likely to be about a language feature with C but about how it's used, because C has so few language features, so its usage gets much more complex much more quickly than C++
[11:21:55] <mathu> HeTo: there are fewer places where a bug in C requires deep language wankery to diagnose than there are in C++. right? do you have an example of something C makes you learn analogous to the rule of 5 in C++? or how non-virtual member function accesses on a null pointer to an object don't actually crash?

[11:29:35] <Satin> the best way to start this sort of thing (or flamewars in less socially aware groups)

[11:30:03] <Satin> and i unitentionally became part of that one too many times to realize that easily myself
[11:30:16] <Satin> should i learn first*
[11:30:38] <mathu> my actual answer to that question is "just pick one and stick with it", i just thought HeTo's description of C vs C++ is different from my opinion + what i usually hear from others
[11:30:55] <mathu> i was a lil surprised by it haha
[11:31:07] <Satin> yeah haha, i realize fully that what's being argued over here is some complexity details and not exact choices

[11:38:33] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: yup
[11:38:40] <mathu> HeTo: i think i see what you're saying, not sure i agree when considering concrete projects
[11:38:54] <HeTo> mathu: another one is the sort of stuff GTK 4 seems to make you do in C. macros and casts everywhere where I think a beginner is going to have a ton of trouble understanding what the stuff does (conceptually, not talking about the implementation) and why it can work and therefore, for example, where a copypasted code, say from one function to another, doesn't work
[11:39:12] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I am glad things are going well for you HubertFarnsworth
[11:39:13] <mathu> HeTo: if everything could be kept to automatic storage duration that would rule. i've tried to write a C++ codebase like that, don't remember how well it worked out
[11:39:14] <HeTo> whereas in C++ you could just use OOP language features for all of that
[11:39:57] <HeTo> mathu: even easier is when you don't even have pointers, except hidden inside classes
[11:40:13] <HeTo> mathu: consider just std::vector vs. T* + size
[11:40:33] <HeTo> mathu: but sure, smart pointers are easier to use correctly than malloc + free

[11:48:00] <mathu> not having to write or copypaste bare essentials in C++ is a big advantage. i don't think you're otherwise well-shielded from magic incantations and obscure failure modes in c++. not sure which comes out on top on balance
[11:48:29] <kariosfox> mhm
[11:49:31] <HeTo> but how would malloc + free be easier to learn than smart pointers? to use them correctly you have to learn ownership anyway, there's just no compiler to tell you you've got it wrong if you make a mistake or try doing something that's wrong because your understanding isn't complete or fully correct yet
[11:50:20] <mathu> which language a beginner should learn or which language a project should choose depends mostly on factors that aren't what we're talking about lol and i think new serious projects that are starting up should be discouraged from using memory-unsafe languages anyway
[11:50:25] <mathu> but interesting chat
[11:51:13] <mathu> HeTo: i know a lot of C programmers who swear by "free what you malloc" but find `FooFactory::create(std::move(injectedDependency))` impenetrable
[11:53:59] <mathu> HeTo: and there's, like, a difference to me between learning the rules and getting them right all the time
[11:56:03] <kariosfox> mathu: it is.
[11:57:29] <HeTo> mathu: I'm not sure what you're referring to by that, but that sounds like an argument for C++, because you're more likely to get a compilation error rather than undefined behaviour, and also rules like "never use this thing" are a lot easier to follow than rules like "when you do X, remember to do Y as well"
[11:57:32] <mathu> HeTo: like, in a C++ crash my decision tree for diagnosing what's wrong is way more complex than it is for C. with C it's just "look at crashing line. am i missing a bounds check? no. so my input pointer is bad, let's walk backwards and see where it's created + grep for other places where it's torn down

[12:01:40] <HeTo> mathu: my problems with new C++ code are compilation errors a lot more often than crashes
[12:02:05] <mathu> i don't seem to spend much time fighting with the compiler outside of template stuff
[12:02:43] <mathu> maybe your codebase is more disciplined about certain things than mine is - within our ownership model there are places where we permit raw pointers for example
[12:02:50] <HeTo> and in old code who knows where the bug is, valgrind is often the help, the bug might even be in a different language from the one where the crash manifests
[12:03:23] <mathu> we've had some insane crashes having to do with different combinations of C, C++ with -fno-exceptions, and C++ with -fexceptions in the same crash stack haha
[12:03:44] <mathu> can't blame that on any of the languages themselves, it was just gnarly to work through haha
[12:04:53] <HeTo> well, I said new code. I prefer to write code in such a way that preferrably if you use it wrong it won't compile. if it cannot be detected at compile time then I prefer to at least get an unhandled exception or std::terminate at runtime, although I think our crashes are very rarely those
[12:05:25] <HeTo> OTOH old code has had the obvious crashes weeded out ages ago. what's left are obscure crashes and bugs
[12:05:26] <mathu> nearly all our crashes are lifetime issues or data races
[12:06:19] <mathu> oh it's late
[12:06:49] <mathu> HeTo: lol we're continually introducing new crashes. development on our codebase moves pretty fast, we have lots of customer team needs
[12:07:20] <mathu> also customer teams that contribute code in our codebase when we can't prioritize it as fast as they'd like, which doesn't always go well (but sometimes goes great!)

[13:42:11] <amigojapan> What is a sloppy Joe?
[13:43:02] <Bco1981> A sloppy joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef, onions, tomato sauce or ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings, served on a hamburger bun.[2] The dish originated in the United States during the early 20th century.
[13:43:45] <Bco1981> Early and mid-20th century American cookbooks offer plenty of sloppy joe-type recipes, though they go by different names: Toasted Deviled Hamburgers,[3] Chopped Meat Sandwiches,[4] Spanish Hamburgers,[5] Hamburg a la Creole,[6] Beef Mironton,[7] and Minced Beef Spanish Style.[8]
[13:44:20] <amigojapan> Bco1981: they have a sloppy Joe burrito. I guess I will try it
[13:44:28] <Bco1981> nice
[13:44:48] <amigojapan> The name sounded yucky

[14:04:38] <HeTo> Satin: you can use a struct as a function return type. from what I can tell from the top of my head, the only thing you cannot use is an array (although syntactically that works, it‚Äôll just be turned into a pointer to an element of that array) (also, pointer to array does work)

[16:26:26] <buZz> not sure if i have a picture of it, i'm sure it has no projectpage

[16:26:44] <buZz> oh i KNOW i dont have a pic of it here on my carryalong laptop
[16:26:51] <buZz> will have one at home somewhere but vpn is down
[16:26:58] <Sadale> As for my calculator, I've assembled like 30 units in my home. And they're getting "sold" very slowly. xD
[16:27:26] <Sadale> For the clock I'm working on, I'm using a dumb 4-digit display. Minimalism. :3
[16:27:34] <Sadale> buZz, do show pic when you've got one tho :3
[16:28:02] <buZz> will do
[16:28:30] <buZz> i'm working on nurdspace.nl/CoreAnet now
[16:28:36] * Sadale lcicks
[16:28:39] * Sadale clicks*
[16:28:41] <buZz> need to replace some part and install better cooling
[16:28:47] <Sadale> ah. reprap
[16:28:56] <buZz> yeah , a corexy one made of anet parts
[16:29:03] <Sadale> damn. It's gonna be difficult
[16:29:08] <Sadale> and fun :D
[16:29:19] <buZz> hehe, it already works
[16:29:26] <buZz> didnt work on it since oct 2020
[16:29:30] <buZz> finished it in .. 2 days
[16:29:31] <buZz> :D
[16:29:31] <Sadale> nice! :3
[16:29:32] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: My final year project was a calculator
[16:29:41] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, IIRC, a scientific one?
[16:29:55] <Sadale> I briefly remember that you told me about that. But I couldn't remember the details
[16:30:14] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: scientific in the sense? it can do trignometric, exponential and stuff
[16:30:22] <Sadale> nice! :3
[16:30:32] <HubertFarnsworth> I guess you can say it's scientific
[16:30:52] <HubertFarnsworth> I wanted to make a graphing calculator on dot matrix lcd Sadale 
[16:31:13] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: but those damn lcd had no manuals or had them in chinese
[16:31:15] <Sadale> good luck on finding a dot matrix LCD
[16:31:32] <HubertFarnsworth> it's easy to find at least in 2009
[16:31:38] <Sadale> And you need a microcontroller or LCD driver to drive that as well. You need the right voltage and frequency and shit
[16:31:40] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: is it hard now?
[16:31:43] <Mellowlink> Aurora_v_kosmose: yes it's kinda sad that freebsd is behind in terms of desktop. even openbsd desktop related ports get more attention these days e.g. web browsers
[16:31:50] <Mellowlink> i currently cope on voidlinux
[16:31:52] <Sadale> No idea. I haven't tried doing that for any of my hobbyist projects.
[16:32:06] <Mellowlink> Aurora_v_kosmose: this distro looks interesting

[16:32:10] <ImoutoBot> [title] Chimera Linux | A Linux distribution based on FreeBSD userland and LLVM
[16:32:35] <Mellowlink> i could switch on that and cope
[16:32:36] <Sadale> I've seen a coworker working on that in a company that I worked for. The LCD panel was a custom one. I suspect that there's a minimum ordering quantity of, maybe 500~1000 panels
[16:32:48] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: no need for lcd driver, it has that chip on that, what's it called black shit?
[16:33:28] <Mellowlink> with the security guide from archwiki. with little effort security mitigations freebsd has can be enabled on linux too
[16:33:31] <Sadale> Oh. ah. I know the kind of LCD panel you're talking about
[16:33:42] <Sadale> yeah some of them have built-in controller.
[16:33:55] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, it looks like your normal 4x16 lcd

[17:33:48] <HubertFarnsworth> KatrinValerie: anyway, you can still give basic courses over online through zoom or what not
[17:34:01] <buZz> so , about 10 points above 'sane' levels :P lol

[17:34:16] <KatrinValerie> The proper IQ scale ends at 141
[17:34:20] <KatrinValerie> meow

[17:36:01] <KatrinValerie> also it drops with age, by design
[17:36:59] <KatrinValerie> And gifted programs turned out to be a massive failure

[17:46:11] <buZz> nice :) congratz
[17:46:28] <KatrinValerie> Getting my tonsils removed was a nightmare in comparison
[17:46:36] <KatrinValerie> or when they fixed my septum

[17:47:04] <Cryowolf> those things are childs play :P
[17:47:15] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: probably
[17:47:52] <Cryowolf> but I kind of grade surgery and post-surgical pain based on the biggest one I've had and that's probably unfair to most people
[17:48:01] <Cryowolf> since they're hopefully never gonna have to do that

[17:56:52] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: Anyone that claims GAS is not highly effective at reducing gender dysphoria is a massive idiot and science denier really.
[17:56:59] <Cryowolf> Mushoku Tensei just had a big moment too, but only 2 episodes left
[17:57:08] <Cryowolf> it was a big "god damn" moment too
[17:57:22] <KatrinValerie> The fear mongering is insane when the levels of satisfaction with surgery are higher than for removal of the appendix
[17:57:29] <buZz> i was playing with 'virt-a-mate' in VR
[17:57:41] <buZz> great fun to 'possess' a female character and play with 'your own boobs' in VR

[17:58:07] <Bco1981> that's a 18+ title isn't it ?
[17:58:17] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: unrelated, but I didn't realize anyone had their appendix removed and was surveyed on how satisfied they were about it
[17:58:19] <Cryowolf> I hope they continue this series all the way cause the story continues into Rudeus adulthood
[17:58:40] <KatrinValerie> buZz: not all trans people need GAS, some are fine as they are some may want hormones 
[17:58:41] <buZz> Bco1981: yeah i think so
[17:58:48] <Cryowolf> its one of few that have a natural progression of time
[17:58:50] <buZz> Bco1981: might be 16+ in some nations i guess? not sure
[17:58:53] <amigojapan> Bco1981: mushoku tensei yes
[17:58:54] <KatrinValerie> for some people it might be as simple as changing their wardrobe and maybe pronouns
[17:59:00] <buZz> KatrinValerie: yeah i understand
[17:59:06] <buZz> not all ADHD ppl need ADHD meds either
[17:59:22] <amigojapan> Bco1981: actually in Japan there is no such thing
[17:59:23] <KatrinValerie> I am lucky that I fit the more stereotypical pattern though

[18:00:04] <KatrinValerie> buZz: have you ever tried herbal remedies?
[18:00:04] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, Ive known trans people that have wanted to keep their genitals, because for them they felt that with hormones etc they finally felt like they were "right"
[18:00:07] <Bco1981> amigojapan: there must be... we see the 18+ sign in anime in video stores.
[18:00:32] <TsundereNoises> also on certain manga
[18:00:32] <Bco1981> amigojapan: the "18+" area not for kids.
[18:00:44] <buZz> i think '18+' varies a lot per region/nation
[18:00:45] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: yeah that's what I am saying, what people want to change is a very personal thing
[18:00:49] <amigojapan> Bco1981: that is for porn

[18:01:12] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: and it's a blessing that people are different like that
[18:02:02] <amigojapan> Bco1981: mushoku tensei is just targeted to adults. It's not placed in the 18+section

[18:11:55] <Bco1981> really ?
[18:12:08] <Bco1981> usually it's because there is sex in it

[18:14:01] <TsundereNoises> it doesn't seem like mal is just making up the concept of 18+ though?
[18:14:11] <TsundereNoises> if they just misapplied it to a few things
[18:14:12] <amigojapan> No
[18:14:39] <amigojapan> It is true there is 18+for ero
[18:15:24] <amigojapan> But Mal is rating things "pg13"which is not a thing in Japan
[18:16:02] <Bco1981> ah yeah, japan don't use the PG system.
[18:16:09] <TsundereNoises> hell it wasn't a thing in the US until 1984, but it's a useful shorthand
[18:16:13] <amigojapan> Or pg in general is not a thing here
[18:16:54] <TsundereNoises> I feel like "pg-13" is almost more useful as a phrase than a movie rating
[18:17:31] <TsundereNoises> like there will be sex, but we'll keep them under the sheets and not show any terrible childhood-destroying nipples
[18:18:23] <amigojapan> Let me see what Mal rates mushoku tensei as
[18:18:39] <amigojapan> !Mal mushoku tensei
[18:18:39] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu (TV Series) | http://myanimelist.net/anime/39535
[18:18:40] <ButterNoodle> *nipples are scary
[18:18:42] <Bco1981> maybe check mirai nikki
[18:19:14] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: yes, before you murder a hooker, make sure she has her pasties on
[18:19:17] <TsundereNoises> else you'll get the R rating
[18:19:32] <TsundereNoises> *or he!
[18:20:29] <ButterNoodle> woah
[18:20:34] <ButterNoodle> male hooker?
[18:20:43] <ButterNoodle> a *mooker?
[18:20:51] <amigojapan> Bco1981: ok but remember mirai Nikki is shounen, for boys
[18:21:05] <ButterNoodle> will they CoD w me and not suck?
[18:21:20] <amigojapan> !Mal mirai Nikki
[18:21:21] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Mirai Nikki (OVA) | http://myanimelist.net/anime/8460
[18:21:24] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I think if you're hiring a male hooker, sucking is literally part of the job description
[18:21:48] <ButterNoodle> tru.. guess I'll have to buy better team mates another way
[18:22:08] <amigojapan> Bco1981: RatingR - 17+ (violence & profanity)
[18:22:28] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it's a show targeted at boys
[18:22:46] <Bco1981> and mirai nikki is R+... which you would think is older...
[18:23:57] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I don't think anyone will check your ID in Japan if you are a kid and purchase it
[18:24:17] <amigojapan> Brb
[18:24:44] * TsundereNoises is still pondering nipple rules
[18:24:59] <HubertFarnsworth> nipple rules?
[18:25:34] <TsundereNoises> I realized that no one cares about cis male nipples in terms of movie rating, although cis female nipples are FORBIDDEN as they will ruin the children
[18:25:40] <TsundereNoises> but what about mtf or ftm nipples?
[18:25:43] <TsundereNoises> which are acceptable?
[18:25:54] <HubertFarnsworth> I thought it's more like no twisting
[18:25:58] <TsundereNoises> is it the breast that makes a nipple horrifying?
[18:25:58] <HubertFarnsworth> haha
[18:26:06] <TsundereNoises> or is it something else?
[18:26:19] <TsundereNoises> because flat-chested cis women nipples are still not allowed
[18:26:23] <HubertFarnsworth> males in anime don't have nipples mostly
[18:26:31] <TsundereNoises> yes, anime is at least consistent
[18:26:36] <TsundereNoises> I'm thinking about american movie ratings
[18:27:07] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't know, I hardly watch movies
[18:27:12] <TsundereNoises> I guess we really need to experiment: we need more trans nudity in american film
[18:27:21] <TsundereNoises> see how it gets rated
[18:27:28] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: Seinfeld says "sex begins when the nipple appears
[18:27:41] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it's true!
[18:27:55] <HubertFarnsworth> ruin children, lol. It's hilarious how people think when nipples are the thing that propagates the human race forward.
[18:28:09] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean before baby formula stuff, babies fucking died
[18:28:18] <HubertFarnsworth> when they couldn't get milk
[18:28:26] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: yes, many babies are big nipple fans
[18:28:42] <HubertFarnsworth> and now nipples are oh no, don't show them to my kid
[18:29:13] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I don't care if my child sees torture or murder or abuse, just as long as you don't corrupt them with NIPPLES
[18:29:28] <amigojapan> Lol
[18:29:33] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[18:29:51] <HubertFarnsworth> TsundereNoises: do you know laser tits?
[18:30:13] <amigojapan> I don't HubertFarnsworth 
[18:30:18] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: not as like a title, but I assume you mean breasts firing lasers which is indeed a concept I've seen somewhere
[18:30:30] <HubertFarnsworth> tits*
[18:30:39] <TsundereNoises> my apologies
[18:30:44] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, they are incredible art wise
[18:30:48] <HubertFarnsworth> I love them

[18:31:22] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: nice, as there are no visible nipples, this site is totally sfw
[18:31:31] <HubertFarnsworth> lol, yes
[18:32:34] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I like the kind of anti-aircraft spread some of these get
[18:32:46] <TsundereNoises> rather than just directional point and shoot laser tits
[18:33:00] <HubertFarnsworth> haha
[18:34:23] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I bet to someone that always sees women in a burka, even seeing the ancle wold feel sexy

[18:37:27] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[18:38:30] <amigojapan> Or in Miami beach
[18:38:54] <HubertFarnsworth> is that a nude beach?
[18:39:02] <amigojapan> No
[18:39:18] <Bco1981> HubertFarnsworth: does not have to be
[18:39:20] <amigojapan> But they allow open breast

[18:45:17] <amigojapan> Jigsy: I have my heater set to 20c. But I am right next to the windows. Proof Windows sucks
[18:45:35] <Jigsy> At the moment I have a hot water bottle.
[18:46:47] <amigojapan> Jigsy: I would do the same but tomako insists we use the heater
[18:47:34] <amigojapan> I just got away from the window and it is warm
[18:47:56] <amigojapan> darkwitch: hey
[18:48:37] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: is your hometown called double entendre? 
[18:49:03] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I don't know what that means
[18:49:21] <HubertFarnsworth> !c double entendre
[18:49:24] <ImoutoBot> HubertFarnsworth: A double entendre is a figure of speech or a particular way of wording that is devised to have a double meaning, of which one is typically obvious, whereas the other often conveys a message that would be too socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly.
[18:49:40] <HubertFarnsworth> double meaning in general amigojapan 
[18:49:47] <amigojapan> Ah
[18:50:07] <amigojapan> But how does that relate to my home HubertFarnsworth ?
[18:50:47] <HubertFarnsworth> I was joking because you said windows suck but you mean not just your windows, also microsoft windows
[18:50:53] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: ^^

[18:51:30] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: is there snow?
[18:51:43] <amigojapan> I love snow
[18:52:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: a little bit of snow, but most of it melted back on monday? or tuesday
[18:52:20] <TsundereNoises> we had a really warm day
[18:52:30] <TsundereNoises> and then it was colder than this yesterday
[18:52:38] <amigojapan> I see

[21:11:43] * Satin listens to the Econonomist Podcast sometimes
[21:11:48] <Satin> MootPoot: exactly
[21:12:05] <MootPoot> ez just take 2 and it'll be 92
[21:12:08] <Satin> MootPoot: you think all the anti vaxxers in africa are going to not get it because it's a threat to their individual liberties?
[21:12:10] <Satin> lolz
[21:12:16] * Satin just had to sry
[21:12:18] <MootPoot> Satin: lol
[21:12:20] <MootPoot> why
[21:12:24] <MootPoot> tbh I doubt it
[21:12:32] <Satin> I kid
[21:12:38] <MootPoot> people in developing countries are a lot less retarded like that
[21:12:44] <Satin> agreed
[21:12:47] <MootPoot> since they actually see people dying from it
[21:12:54] <Satin> MootPoot: in general Asia is sane about it, and a lot of Europe too it seems
[21:12:56] <MootPoot> like the boomers in their day SAW smallpox
[21:13:03] <MootPoot> and were all gung ho about vaccines
[21:13:25] <Satin> MootPoot: trust me, i share uh certain invidiuals in here who shalt not be named, concerns about big government and i don't want it to turn like some european countries
[21:13:29] <Satin> where they trust the state too much
[21:13:32] <Satin> but at the same damm time
[21:13:43] <MootPoot> well , the state is made up of the people
[21:13:45] <Satin> get with the times, society is very strongly interconnected
[21:13:55] <MootPoot> its the west that has this weird mental divide
[21:14:02] <MootPoot> about the "state" being a seperate ting
[21:14:04] <MootPoot> thing
[21:14:04] <Satin> governments *do* need powers to be able to have effective broad public health policies
[21:14:16] <Satin> we don't live in isolated far away hamlets and towns anymore
[21:14:48] <Satin> MootPoot: i mean it is an important discussion to be had. the relationship between state and its citizens is talked about a lot in political philosophy, etc and is important
[21:14:59] <Satin> MootPoot: genuinely in places like Singapore, Malaysia and some other countries
[21:15:12] <Satin> those guys are essentially rulled by a few who think they know what's good
[21:15:16] <Satin> and run the state
[21:15:18] <Satin> that's bad too
[21:15:34] <MootPoot> >those guys are essentially rulled by a few who think they know what's good
[21:15:35] <Satin> but so is this other extreme of getting in the way of common sense powers for all of us
[21:15:40] <MootPoot> tbh thats any form of rule
[21:15:42] <MootPoot> really
[21:15:53] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah but there's no way for malaysian or SG people to really kick these guys out
[21:16:02] <Satin> versus the US or some european countries
[21:16:08] <MootPoot> second amendment time
[21:16:13] <Satin> the chinese model is stronger in the east, state capitalism mixed with authoritian aspects
[21:16:18] <MootPoot> mass ship some AR15s to singapore
[21:16:22] <Satin> so it's a mix and balance
[21:16:31] * Satin is a sucker for nuance as much as possible
[21:16:34] <MootPoot> I kid
[21:16:48] <Satin> MootPoot: in those countries, AR15s aren't going to solve anything
[21:16:50] <Satin> same in india
[21:17:05] <MootPoot> india is easy
[21:17:06] <Satin> maybe AR15s will fix things in eastern europe former USSR /s
[21:17:14] <MootPoot> just burn the spice farm
[21:17:18] <MootPoot> lol

[21:18:39] <Satin> yeah i noticed
[21:18:44] <Satin> tsunderenoises of course said -6 in C
[21:18:52] <Satin> now, was it because of it was minus figures
[21:18:56] <ButterNoodle> yea
[21:18:59] <Satin> or was he trying to fit in with you europeans?
[21:19:00] <Satin> who knows
[21:19:02] <ButterNoodle> why use C
[21:19:03] <MootPoot> the only exception I know about the vaccine thing
[21:19:08] <Satin> I think he was trying to fit in
[21:19:09] <Jigsy> I think I might start asking Americans to use F for minus.
[21:19:10] <MootPoot> is afghanistan + pakistan
[21:19:13] <Jigsy> Just to be annoying. :D
[21:19:16] <Satin> plus, tsun is a bit of a scientist type

[23:04:34] <MootPoot> I can finally run moca without accidentally connecting to the neighbours

[23:06:12] <Cryowolf> Uh, a hardware firewall still has firmware unleses I missed something?
[23:06:30] <MootPoot> you did miss something
[23:06:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: It's a not-totally-technically-right joke about wire vs wifi
[23:06:45] <Cryowolf> oh
[23:06:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is that wire prevents easy interception and induction of arbitrary data.
[23:07:13] <Cryowolf> yes, air gaps, no wifi etc
[23:07:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Though the coax filter mention makes me think that at the wiring level the neighbor is on the same cable, but using different frequencies.
[23:07:42] <Cryowolf> those would be common rules in any imagined hac ker group I conceived in my head
[23:07:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So the filter is roughly analogous to a VLAN setup
[23:08:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Except not subject to nearly as many bypasses.
[23:10:09] <MootPoot> MoCa is blind 
[23:10:17] <MootPoot> it'll connect to any other MoCa thing it can find
[23:10:58] <MootPoot> so you basically cuck it with avlan like setup - except instead of a vlan its a low pass coax filter that blocks all the frequencies MoCa uses
[23:11:32] <MootPoot> which is about 1.1-1.6ghz
[23:11:47] <MootPoot> while still allowing docsis and cable tv - which is under 1.1 
[23:12:16] <MootPoot> docsis 3.1 can exceep 1.1 by like 50mhz but barely anyone uses it and you can just configure your modem to not use that band

[23:28:46] <Satin> and lament the fact that they, not us, control our politics
[23:29:09] <MootPoot> satin is a political masochist
[23:29:46] <MootPoot> in other news
[23:29:56] <MootPoot> I did a whole piece today
[23:29:59] <MootPoot> on the piano
[23:30:05] <MootPoot> altough it was only my right hand
[23:32:38] <Satin> using your right hand
[23:32:55] <MootPoot> *gasp*
[23:33:01] <MootPoot> she made a pervy joke!
[23:33:06] <MootPoot> I'm so proud
[23:33:43] <Satin> no
[23:33:49] <Satin> it was just too obvious
[23:34:46] <MootPoot> Satin: 
[23:34:52] <MootPoot> it feels like learning dvorak or something
[23:35:07] <MootPoot> getting used to a different layout and set of characters
[23:35:07] <Satin> i can imagine
[23:35:18] <MootPoot> although its not too hard
[23:35:24] <MootPoot> especially when its gamified
[23:35:35] <MootPoot> FUCK learning from books or those dull videos
[23:35:38] <MootPoot> I wanna beep boop
[23:35:46] <MootPoot> I treat it like playing OSU
[23:37:29] <Satin> MootPoot: i'm trying to be more disciplined about that but it's hard
[23:37:35] <Satin> might try learning some meth soon
[23:37:59] <MootPoot> oh no
[23:38:04] <MootPoot> fuck discipilne
[23:38:08] <MootPoot> fuck motivation
[23:38:10] <MootPoot> both dont work
[23:38:18] <MootPoot> what you're looking for is "habit"
[23:38:42] <MootPoot> you need to default to the thing you want to do , and make that thing coding/project/whatever you actually want to do isntead of mindless time wasting
[23:38:47] <MootPoot> imo
[23:39:38] <Satin> yes
[23:39:45] <Satin> both

[23:42:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: DOCSIS 3.1 is rather desirable though, but few ISPs offer bandwidths where it's useful without also simply switching over to fiber.
[23:42:43] <MootPoot> I do have docsis 3.1
[23:42:59] <MootPoot> I could get fiber - but the 2 main ISP's in my city only one offers it
[23:43:07] <MootPoot> the buildout is happening - slowly
[23:43:20] <MootPoot> they promised this year for my area - but you can only build in summer here
[23:43:37] <MootPoot> we have 3 seasons in canaderp - Wildfires , winter, or construction
[23:43:56] <MootPoot> 2 roads away from me they have fiber there
[23:44:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> My modem supports it, but whether that's what's being sent it is another question entirely.
[23:44:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Considering how low my bandwidth caps, I doubt it strongly.
[23:44:19] <MootPoot> you cant check?
[23:44:36] <MootPoot> my isp modem lets you see
[23:44:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I don't have the kind of expensive COAX tester I need for that.
[23:44:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I've got an unmanaged modem-only machine.
[23:44:52] <MootPoot> just within the modem config
[23:44:54] <MootPoot> ah
[23:44:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't trust my ISP with my router's configs.
[23:45:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also most such routers don't have proper firmware/OSes.
[23:45:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> My modem is roughly analogous in use to your MoCA adapters, effectively.

[23:50:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yup. Nice, simple, not really hackable.
[23:50:34] <Jigsy> Human Resources.
[23:50:39] <MootPoot> Jigsy: cuddlefuck
[23:50:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's a good choice.
[23:51:00] <MootPoot> perfect for fuck , cuddle, and sleep
[23:51:02] <MootPoot> what more do you want
[23:51:08] <MootPoot> oh, talking too
[23:55:14] <MootPoot> I just had a thought
[23:55:16] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: 
[23:55:32] <MootPoot> if you can already maintain gigabit speeds over coax 
[23:55:40] <MootPoot> why have rj45
[23:56:01] <MootPoot> probably just legacy now that I think about it
[23:56:06] <MootPoot> rj45 was here long before
[23:56:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mostly because the transceivers are more complicated and expensive to make
[23:56:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No need to bother with fancy encodings when you instead have separate data channels.
[23:56:42] <MootPoot> I thought they were expensive because barely anyone needs them
[23:56:47] <MootPoot> or makes them
[23:56:52] <MootPoot> there are like 4 companies in total
[23:56:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Both.
[23:57:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But coax also has less data channels so the multiplexing of stuff on it is more complicated.
[23:57:36] <MootPoot> actiontec/screenbeam, D-link ,  translite and Hitron
[23:57:43] <MootPoot> maybe a few others I dont know
[23:58:11] <MootPoot> I wonder how I'll use my powerline adapters now that I have moca...
[23:58:18] <MootPoot> the garage is pretty shit
[23:58:22] <MootPoot> no coax there
[23:58:27] <MootPoot> maybe that
[23:58:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Look at the operating frequencies for ethernet cabling too.
[23:58:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Much lower for higher bandwidth.
[23:59:08] <MootPoot> advantage of all those channels I guess
[23:59:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yup.
[23:59:12] <MootPoot> or not channels
[23:59:14] <MootPoot> wrong word
[23:59:15] <MootPoot> lines
[23:59:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Same difference, yeah.
