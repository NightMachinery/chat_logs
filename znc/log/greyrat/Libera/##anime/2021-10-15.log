[02:43:24] <Smeef> Back to good health I hope?
[02:43:32] <Satin> relativelyyyy much better, not quite addressed PSTD stuff so working on that while i fail my semester but yeah lol
[02:43:35] <Satin> yeah, physically much better
[02:44:02] <Smeef> Yeah, that PTSD can be a real bee-otch
[02:44:09] <Satin> mhm
[02:44:23] <Satin> i got diagnosed like 1-2 months before school started and the family doctor just uh prescribed .. basically supplements
[02:44:29] <Satin> NuAdapt and Lithium Orate
[02:44:51] <Smeef> My sis is dealing with it right now after a traumatic experience, she's been living here for a while getting help with it
[02:44:56] <Satin> for the physical side, and he was a bit on the "possibly not" side when my dad (who stigmatizes mental health) asked if i really needed therapy or such
[02:45:15] <Satin> and then ontop of that, my own ego and self, not understanding ptsd + underestimating it since i don't have nightmares
[02:45:21] <Smeef> Sheesh, sorry about your dad :6
[02:45:28] <Satin> and that's all come to converge in a bad experience lol, but it could be worse
[02:45:45] <Satin> oh wow, hope your sis does better. glad to hear she has great resources like you
[02:46:09] <Satin> yeah. My first ever mental health counselling appointment from the campus services is tomorrow morning
[02:46:23] <Satin> I'm secretly hoping it quickly escalates to them offering me a refferal to a full psychathrist
[02:46:36] <Smeef> It used to be daily panic attacks, now we're down to weekly, and I'm pretty sure it's been a full week now since the last one, it gets better
[02:46:50] <Smeef> Just takes time
[02:46:56] <Satin> wow :x, and yeah it really does
[02:47:13] <Satin> mine are more.... subtle, which is why I've been gaslighting myself sometimes and being overtly self critical and stupid
[02:47:30] <Satin> I don't get direct panic attacks but I have looming physical anxiety even when i'm mentally relatively alright
[02:47:44] <Satin> and hyperviligance and such feels so "natural" that i have trouble distinguishing it sometimes
[02:47:56] <Satin> and then the hyperventilating panic attacks do happen once in a while, plus tremors
[02:48:10] <Satin> only the tremors are constant and my strongest piece of evidence*

[02:49:53] <Smeef> That sounds like how I've dealt/been dealing, lol. You're right about that it could be worse. I could be wrong, but I think personalities like ours manifest anxiety differently
[02:50:07] <Satin> absolutely
[02:50:08] <SpiritOfSummer> snake: what is it like having no legs?
[02:50:15] <Satin> my physics prof and later the associate dean both told me
[02:50:21] <Satin> not to minimize what i went through basically
[02:50:35] <Satin> bceause my style of speech is "it could have been worse" among other things
[02:50:40] <Satin> when talking about it IRL
[02:50:42] <Smeef> snake, you know, that's not a bad idea, lol, I have an old DS I can give my sis
[02:51:27] <snake> Smeef, you can play tetris on the pc too, i think it doesnt need to be the original tetris game but more research is needed in this regard
[02:51:32] <Smeef> Satin, they're right, my therapist said something similar to me, but I don't think he knows what he's talking about XD /s

[03:16:48] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u know what americano is?
[03:17:07] <MootPoot> americano is that uh, large size medium strength coffee
[03:17:09] <MootPoot> with no milk
[03:17:12] <MootPoot> right?
[03:17:57] <ButterNoodle> :|
[03:18:17] <MootPoot> :-:
[03:18:30] <ButterNoodle> americano is 2 shots espresso mixed with about 4oz of hot water
[03:18:38] <ButterNoodle> *watered down
[03:18:50] <ButterNoodle> I think that hario will give u a better cup than that tbh
[03:19:55] <ButterNoodle> I think pour over gives u a good balance between needing a $500 espresso machine and $300 grinder, and the muddy taste that u get from french press
[03:20:18] <ButterNoodle> *french press is more caffeine tho since ur actually drinking physical coffee
[03:20:49] <MootPoot> every road leads to the v60
[03:20:58] <MootPoot> why is this
[03:21:11] <ButterNoodle> and still if ur machine doesnt have pre/post is not gonna be great
[03:21:23] <MootPoot> so what I'm getting is
[03:21:33] <ButterNoodle> so make that $1500 machine and $300 grinder
[03:21:37] <ButterNoodle> yea
[03:21:47] <MootPoot> the best most solid way for cheap to get good coffee is basically just a v60 and any burr grinder + whole beans
[03:21:50] <ButterNoodle> v60 is the best cup for the investment and effort
[03:21:50] <MootPoot> is that really it
[03:21:58] <ButterNoodle> fax
[03:22:04] * MootPoot sighs
[03:22:05] <MootPoot> FINE
[03:22:09] <MootPoot> MOTHERFUCKERS
[03:22:14] <MootPoot> ILL GET THE STUPID V60
[03:22:17] <ButterNoodle> I put away my aeropress/chemex/french press and only do v60
[03:22:35] <MootPoot> now I actually have to put effort into making cofeee
[03:22:44] <ButterNoodle> even w my shitty grinder its still an amazing cup
[03:22:47] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: do I need that fancy little kettle too
[03:22:58] <ButterNoodle> plastic measuring cup
[03:22:59] <ButterNoodle> ez

[03:23:16] <ButterNoodle> some people use scales and pour water based on weight
[03:23:26] <ButterNoodle> yuck
[03:23:27] <ButterNoodle> why
[03:23:34] <ButterNoodle> microwave water?
[03:24:01] <ButterNoodle> $20 electric kettle

[08:50:20] <Nanobot> If the current ATH ends up being in the OTE long zone of the eventual peak, that would put the peak somewhere in the $163k - $290k range. Definitely no confidence in those numbers, but I'm using them to figure out what levels would be reasonable. My hope is that my final sell is in what would later become the OTE short zone of the eventual peak. If those numbers I mentioned play out, then the eventual OTE short zone would be somewhere in the range of

[16:21:08] <DunceCotus> there was an unclean break in 2012 (or more accurately between late 2009 to late 2012)
[16:21:18] <DunceCotus> the world was split or something
[16:21:46] <DunceCotus> CERN is possibly both cause and outcome of this splitting
[16:21:56] <DunceCotus> perhaps Steins;Gate really was accurate
[16:22:44] <DunceCotus> the trauma of this break caused a cultural nostalgia 
[16:22:45] <amigojapan> Steins gate is supposed to be a comedy
[16:23:23] <DunceCotus> it was funny yes
[16:23:31] <DunceCotus> but also amazingly accurate
[16:23:36] <DunceCotus> weirdly so
[16:23:56] <DunceCotus> it tapped into the zeitgeist I suppose
[16:24:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if you are looking for truth, anime is not good place to look

[21:49:24] <ezekielnoob> just ahving to do a major refactoring
[21:49:52] <ezekielnoob> i think vistual studio also has the same thing
[21:51:41] <pteague> actually, regex might not work ... i'd `grep -n ant file.txt| grep -v ant_man` & you should get line numbers
[21:53:16] <ezekielnoob> pteague hmm alright thanks i'll keep that in mind
[21:54:04] <pteague> grep, sed, & awk are useful tools

[23:16:49] <Roey> there's no nazi message, it's your mind racing to find something to feel upset about.
[23:17:06] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: do you know anything about capture cards 
[23:17:14] <MootPoot> Does it matter what one I get 
[23:18:04] <Nanobot> My stove decided to keep heating and heating as if I had it set to hi, when it was actually set to medium-low. Even when I switched it off, it kept heating it. I had to jiggle the knob to get it to turn off. Long story short, this stir-fry is cooked very unevenly.
[23:18:12] <MootPoot> Don't have room for work laptop on my desk so I'd like to just leave it in the corner and plug it into a capture card to into my pc
[23:19:21] <MootPoot> Can I get a cheap as shit one 
[23:19:41] <sahwar> BTW, why does IRCv3 _not_ include a GNU mailman-like html5/txt/json/commonmark.org-based method for periodically exporting the full channel chatlog and web-hosting it somewhere, and synching it with the IRC channel as a read-only 'VIEW PREVIOUS MESSAGES IN THE CHATLOG'?
