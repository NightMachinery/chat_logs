[04:23:28] <phogg> MrElendig: surprising. I thought the idea was that 10 would be the last version and everything would be a free downloadable upgrade after that. The only reason to do an 11 in my mind would be to be able to charge for it.
[04:23:39] <Dagmar> phogg: I thought the same thing
[04:23:52] <Dagmar> Like, W10 isn't a liability bomb waiting to go off like 8 was
[04:24:01] <bpmedley> silux : Yes, they are similar.  Except with telnet you can type interactively.  I don't know if netcat has an interactive mode.
[04:24:10] <Sauvin> How was Windows 8 a "liability bomb"?
[04:24:11] <Dagmar> ...and W7 was just a world-consuming malware event waiting to happen
[04:24:13] <MrElendig> phogg: they want to do some massive security changes which breaks backwards compability
[04:24:22] <silux> bpmedley: I think it's a great way to show how HTTP even work and that in the iend it too is just text and not some computer magic...

[04:24:35] <Dagmar> Sauvin: The state most of the installs appeared to be in, because the update mechanism was just f**king broken

[04:53:05] <Sauvin> So, blackgatonegro, can Rust use C libs?
[04:53:09] <Gustavo6046> depends on what you are actually porting

[04:57:33] <puff> When docked I'm using it with an acer 27" monitor via HDMI out.  Normally ubuntu is smart enough to resize everything when I undock, not sure what happened here. Hm, I did do suspend before unplugging everything.
[04:57:40] <puff> blackgatonegro: Will that close my apps or etc?
[04:57:42] <Gustavo6046> yep, I did a pool allocator then wrote a list container on top of it

[06:13:00] <bruvvha> your crapton of tests can be done in checkmk just as they are done in nagios
[06:13:20] <bruvvha> you use check scripts just as you do in nagios
[06:13:26] <Dagmar> I am not about to switch testing frameworks for no visible benefit
[06:13:30] <bruvvha> as it is based on nagios
[06:13:38] <bruvvha> so it is the same framework as a base
[06:13:46] <Dagmar> That's not exactly a point in it's favor, man
[06:14:11] <bruvvha> ok points in its favour... the check engine was rewritten, and is more efficient which means it draws less cpu
[06:14:22] <Dagmar> At one point I nearly sat down and wrote them a _new_ process scheduler
[06:14:37] <bruvvha> it also has more notification handlers like atlassians opsgenie

[06:16:25] <Bossi> hi folks, i am getting out of ideas why i cant unmount a filesystem, lsof and fuser dont show any use, also have the nfsserver stopped, but still one filesystem refuses to umount

[06:16:44] <Dagmar> Bossi: Something is definitely useing it.  Make sure it's not (heh) you sitting in a directory in there
[06:17:10] <Bossi> as i already said, lsof does not show any usage for that path or device

[07:23:15] <Dagmar> VGA is somewhat reliable compared to purely analog
[07:23:17] <hamtrax> I would use the VGA input if it wasn't literally dog crap
[07:23:19] <twainwek> do usb type-c hubs require specific drivers
[07:23:23] <sheep> I have YIQ
[07:23:29] <sheep> *hate
[07:23:30] <Dagmar> twainwek: Generally no.
[07:23:34] <jim> tusko, vga is just really old, too small and not enough colors
[07:23:35] <tusko> If, by that, you mean colors look different on every different display, I know that struggle.
[07:23:51] <Dagmar> Your USB chipset on your motherboard might, but as far as that goes a hub is a basic USB device
[07:24:06] <Dagmar> tusko: I mean by that the colors looked different from _day to day_
[07:24:25] <Dagmar> tusko: I was doing an entire LCARS theme for MythTV including animated portions
[07:24:32] <tusko> it was always weird to me that they modeled VGA off of a classic vacuum tube circuit or whatever
[07:25:11] <twainwek> Dagmar: so how does an ethernet->usb type-c work
[07:25:23] <Dagmar> So, after obtaining about a dozen different DVDs and blu-rays to screencap everything and sample the colors _exactly_ I had a display that looked just freakin' perfect on the LCD flatpanel, but looked a little wonky on the CRT
[07:25:38] <Dagmar> I looked a little closer, and realized the colors were off.
[07:26:01] <Dagmar> I went and got the tools necesary to take precise readings, cracked open the unit, and adjusted the trimpots.
[07:26:07] <Dagmar> Two days later, colors are wonky again
[07:26:30] <Dagmar> It's like 2% off but it's enough i can see it when the displays are side by side

[10:02:41] <no_gravity> Sauvin: Arriving on the local.

[10:28:07] <no_gravity> Sauvin: The files are growing until they max out the disk. That is how the system learns. So the backup solution will have to not create additional files.

[11:27:48] <Helmholtz> so the cat command is overridden to work on files and "function calls"?
[11:28:02] <sheep> no, it uses the same read system call that everything else does
[11:28:16] <sheep> but the kernel itself has special handling for opening virtual files like this
[11:28:38] <Helmholtz> Is it just Linux that is like this? What about windows/openBSD?

[11:29:41] <Helmholtz> ?
[11:29:50] <sheep> no. strace just traces system calls
[11:30:06] <sheep> you would just see calls to read or similar functions that are also used for regular files
[11:30:25] <sheep> I think you would need a kernel debugger to trace what is actually happening
[11:30:34] <sheep> or look at the linux source code
[11:30:43] <Helmholtz> so linux has a read_file function, which in it, behavious differently for virtual files

[12:21:56] <Deknos> admit, these are edge cases, but they exist

[14:49:15] <Shapeshifter> Something technical I'm wondering about. Whenever an IO device is "temporarily unavailable", like say, a hard drive spinning up, file managers, shells etc. all just "freeze". I know it's because the resource is pending, but doesn't linux have a better mechanism to deal with this? It appears that every single application has to be implemented "correctly" for this lag to be incorporated. Take thunar,
[14:49:15] <no_gravity> lopid: subshell? Dunno. I just type ./scriptname.sh<enter> to run it.
[14:49:21] <Shapeshifter> for example. It just freezes. Why wouldn't the developers have implemented a worker thread the show a loading animation and allow me to navigate somewhere else in the meantime?
[14:49:25] <Shapeshifter> seems like such a basic feature that I would consider it a bug. Same goes for bash, too.
[14:49:31] <lopid> can you show the full script?

[15:59:23] <bewees> what cross-platform software do you recommend for non-programming related documentation in Linux? For now I used text files and `grep -R` to find keywords in files. But if the notes become lengthy or reference to pictures text files become hard to read. With .odt/.docx file I can just do `unzip -ca "$i" 2>/dev/null | grep -iq "$*"`. Do you think thats a good idea to just use libreoffice for notes?

[17:27:10] <TheWild> Program A takes reads elements from fd 0 and fd 1, then produces result and writes it to fd 2. Program B runs A as a child, writes elements to A's fd 0 and fd 1 then reads result from A's fd 2. Is there a chance for this to work, or there's an assumption somewhere in the systme that fd 0 is only for A's reading (B's writing) and fd 1 and fd 2 are for A's writing (B's reading)?

[23:55:21] <clangLover> Hey, I am inventing a new init system called InitKit. It is written in C++ and designed to be fully object-oriented and fully modular by message-passing. It include a handy System Administration Console (written as a TUI using the excellent "Turbo::Vision" TUI library), the InitKit Internal Debugger (an init system debugger built into the InitKit Control Daemon accessible by pressing ctrl-alt-delete at runtime on GNU/Linux only, or Ctrl-C during boot o

[23:55:26] <clangLover> during boot on BSD, HP-UX, and AIX), and many more things. I will make InitKit have a systemd compatibility subsystem as well, so that we will solve the Init Systems Debate once and forever. Join us: https://github.com/InitKit/InitKit Join Us
