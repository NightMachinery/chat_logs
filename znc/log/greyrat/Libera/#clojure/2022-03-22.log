[20:53:43] <seebs> like, if this were coming back as a runtime exception, i would understand why that was a runtime exception, after the code has been compiled, and once it is executing.
[20:53:57] <seebs> i think this implies that clojure is doing a *lot* more evaluation and execution "at compile time" than i was expecting.
[20:54:55] <seebs> i am reminded of an argument i once had with a spectacularly clueless person, who had written a program (in C++-ish) that read a file, and when it was done reading the file, created a buffer of size based on the size of the file.
[20:55:04] <seebs> and who insisted that the compiler would generate a static compile-time size.
[20:55:09] <seebs> because it would read the file.
[20:55:31] <seebs> hmm. so if i made this use a command-line parameter as the source, would it still be a compile error?

[21:55:27] <sobel> that is yikes
[21:55:52] <sobel> one time i fired my manager because he decided to quit his job and start coding...like that
[21:57:02] <sobel> it was my first job and i was entirely unaware that this guy was masquerading as a super smart programmer outside of our little dev pit, where he was just making a mess
[21:57:14] <sobel> good times
[21:57:47] <technomancy> seebs: "compile time" is just that subset of runtime when the function being run is a compiler
[22:00:01] <technomancy> but yeah, that's pretty typical of lisps that compiling the code and running it are the same thing
[22:00:06] <technomancy> that's why you don't put side-effects at the top level
[22:00:23] <seebs> ahh, i see.
[22:00:57] <technomancy> the only exception I know of is racket, and racket's module compilation model honestly makes my head spin
[22:01:03] <seebs> also though it's very weird to me for this to be labeled a "syntax error". like, the code contains no errors in syntax, the code would run fine on other input data.
[22:01:17] <technomancy> seebs: oh yeah! absolutely. it's straight up wrong IMO.
[22:01:19] <seebs> it's never RICO but sometimes with Racket i wonder
[22:01:29] <technomancy> bug in the compiler as far as I'm concerned, but it's intentional, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:02:22] <seebs> i guess the right question is, if i anticipate a possible exception, how i should be handling it so that it doesn't produce this message but instead does something useful.
[22:02:24] <technomancy> it's relatively recent too; it hasn't always misclassified top-level errors as syntax errors
[22:02:53] <technomancy> well, you should probably structure it such that anticipated errors don't happen at the top level?
[22:02:55] <technomancy> if possible
[22:03:33] <seebs> I'm not sure I understand the "top level" vs "not top level" distinction here.
[22:04:48] <technomancy> are you like ... opening a file or a socket outside a defn in a clj file?
[22:05:00] <technomancy> if so, consider not doing that
[22:08:30] <sobel> seebs: "top level" refers to the syntax tree here
[22:09:24] <seebs> so, i tried changing my test program to put the function that was doing this in a (defn), and then adding a top-level (foo) call, and nothing changed.
[22:09:52] <seebs> in my original case, it's in (defn -main ...)
[22:10:22] *** Quits: mbuf (~Shakthi@136.185.72.170) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:11:10] <sobel> so the (defn) will produce a function you can call any time, including compile time if you call it from the top level
[22:11:12] <technomancy> if it's in -main it should be fine?
[22:16:46] <seebs> it should be, yes
[22:16:51] <seebs> and yet i get the syntax error
[22:19:29] <seebs> okay just to sanity-check: https://gist.github.com/seebs/3cf0050282cdda7cc6db9394da794adc this is my program, which runs fine. if i remove one of the "61" from the line defining testdata, it now produces a "syntax error", at line 23 (the call to foo).
[22:19:43] <seebs> > Clojure CLI version 1.10.3.1075
[22:19:45] <seebs> if this matters
[22:20:37] <Para> "syntax error" is jsut a mislabeling from clojure itself.
[22:21:08] <Para> "Got an exception in REPL, has to be a syntax issue."
[22:21:11] <technomancy> seebs: are you loading that file using clojure.core/load or clojure.core/require or whatever?
[22:21:42] <seebs> "clj -M foo.clj"
[22:21:45] <seebs> that may be the problem
[22:21:49] <technomancy> yeah
[22:22:06] <seebs> but i get the same behavior from "lein run" in a larger program

[22:43:04] <seebs> hmm. so there's a 1.11.0 release, and lein knows about it, but if i go to the getting started guide, it still says 1.10.3-1087, and i don't know what magic-build-number to put after 1.11.0
[22:43:12] <seebs> if i wanted plain old clj to be 1.11

[23:18:23] <sobel> lumpy space princess? i used to know that acronym in java land.
[23:19:05] <ridcully_> my brain read that as l-something server pages?  guess language server protocol?  i'd totally expected that to be utf-8 coming from the js world?

[23:19:57] <sobel> yeah i am fighting hard not to just make something up. overactive brain is overactive.
[23:20:05] <sobel> linux server pages
[23:20:15] <ridcully_> haha that was one of mine too ;)
[23:21:02] <sobel> best candidate seems to be Language Server Protocol which i sure hope is the REPL bus in vscode or all is lost
[23:21:32] *** Joins: justOkay (~justache@user/justache)
[23:23:57] <seebs> Language Server Protocol, it's a spec vscode published that can be used for editors to talk to arbitrary language tools for things like syntax-highlighting
[23:23:57] <hiredman> you know javascript is utf-16
[23:24:14] <hiredman> (strings in js)
[23:24:27] <seebs> and which turns out to be a horrible spec because the people writing the "spec" don't know what a spec is and just sort of wrote half-baked documentation for what they think the features do, and it has exactly and exclusively the features vscode needs.
[23:24:32] <seebs> for the languages they care about.
[23:24:44] <seebs> it's awful and yet it's better than not having a common protocol so
[23:26:07] <sobel> seebs: they're agilely dogfooding code and protocols on end-users and no one says a THING about it
[23:26:24] <seebs> well it *is* better than not having one, probably
[23:26:32] <sobel> iff you use VSCode
[23:26:32] <seebs> i just wish they'd gotten anyone involved who'd ever worked on a spec before
[23:26:45] <seebs> emacs, atom, and i think vim all support LSP now
[23:26:53] <seebs> it works okay
[23:26:56] <seebs> well
[23:27:03] <hiredman> I've fixed bugs where some code was miscounting how long a buffer needed to be, because a length prefixed message from javascript (utf16) was counted as encoded json (utf8) where the character count wasn't correct for the server (java, utf16)
[23:27:15] <seebs> it works better than having to separately write a syntax highlighter for each language for each editor
[23:27:17] * sobel jawdrops
[23:27:37] <sobel> i might have stopped at mismatched buffer sizes and only figured it out today
[23:27:41] <seebs> yeah lsp has a lot of that because of their persistent "well, okay, you can use UTF-8 but character counts still have to be for UTF-16" stuff
[23:30:26] <sobel> i think i've seen encoding related errors since i started seeing encodings. when i worked on a CA in 1999 it was too common to get order of operations wrong and end up encoding cleartext in DER
[23:30:31] <sobel> or something equally disastrous
[23:34:13] <technomancy> wow I knew LSP is clownshoes but I didn't know that particular detail
