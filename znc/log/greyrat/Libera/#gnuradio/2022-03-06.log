[19:39:39] <schneider> i'm working on transfering an IQ stream of a USRP via a potentially lossy IP connection and I'd like to periodically repeat the 'rx_time' tag it outputs (with updated values). Does someone know if there is an existing block out there which does something like that?

[20:02:54] <muaddib[m]> I think it only outputs rx_time on startup,  retune or dropped samples. patchvonbraun would know.
[20:03:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Gr-UHD indeed only inserts those tags at those times, although then underlying UHD interface provides time stamps on every packet from the radio.
[20:07:07] <muaddib[m]> schneider: you could also implement your own time tags/ sample counter on the upstream side of the link.
[20:07:20] <muaddib[m]> * the upstream /downstream side of
[20:11:50] <schneider> muaddib[m]: downstream i don't know how many samples were lost on the link
[20:12:12] <schneider> patchvonbraun[m]: exactly, it only does it when needed which generally is fine to reduce overhead
[20:12:29] <schneider> i'd repeat it every 1e6 samples or so...
[20:16:12] <muaddib[m]> That’s what i mean. Sorry I wasn’t clear, just waking up.
[20:20:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> Have your IP transport include a 32-bit or 64-bit sequence number in every placket. The RX side can sanity check that sequence counter. If guy have fixed number of samples per packet you know exactly how many samples you lost when you get a sequence number that is larger than expected.

[20:27:39] <n1ai[m]> So, a basic question: if you're coding that receive app, presumably you can determine that it's time to play samples but there are none to play, so do you just create the same number of zeros as the number of missing samples to fill the gap? 
[20:28:26] <muaddib[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "Have your IP transport include a..." <- Couldn’t you also just use vector sink/source?
[20:28:56] <muaddib[m]> I guess you wouldn’t know if you dropped an entire vector, but it might make the problem a bit easier.
[20:29:03] <n1ai[m]> * the gap?   Or is there some other method to use to generate the missing samples?
[20:29:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> I don’t think that helps.
[20:31:08] <muaddib[m]> Ok
[20:45:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> If the sample rates aren't horrific, it would be easy to build a custom UDP source/sink that inserts a leading sequence number and "does stuff" when there are missing samples.
