[00:00:00] <parsnip> i have used package.el the most, on average
[00:00:20] <Catie> I think there's something to be said for lowering the barrier to entry, regarding the 'starter kit' thing
[00:00:32] <TRS-80> although I do look around from time to time for something to manage tihngs which are not available in repos
[00:00:38] <parsnip> but i keep the installation all in one section, separate from other config
[00:00:42] <linj[m]> markofcorn: it's convenient if you modify packages
[00:00:59] <parsnip> if i need to move away from straight.el, i could quickly swap out a few lines of code to install the same list
[00:01:26] <TRS-80> Catie: I guess I feel like the whole point of Emacs is to tailor it to /your/ needs, and all of that additional layers of abstraction only gets in the way of that (besides adding complexity)

[00:07:31] <markofcorn> Fair enough, I think you all make some good points, and I have been trying to learn more after the last time I hit bankruptcy. I think I'll start removing some of the obfuscation
[00:07:36] <parsnip> Catie: i think if someone is not capable of digging in with a starter kit, they try to get help from the starter kit community, find it doesn't have the time to help with beginner problems, they end up at the friendlier or more patient #emacs, and now we're faced with a question wrapped up with a starter kit
[00:07:37] <acdw> i just curl <some package here> | emacs

[00:52:46] <TRS-80> markofcorn: OK so lazy loading.  I think this is a feature of use-package, straight and others I guess.  So in vanilla Emacs, there are 2 other approaches.  Either the package uses autoload cookies / functionality, and/or you just run Emacs asa server.  I personally do the latter.
[00:54:59] <TRS-80> when you 'install' using package.el, it creates an autoloads file, which tells Emacs where to find things, then they are loaded later when needed
[00:55:08] <mwnaylor> I tend to run two emacs servers. One for general use, like this current erc session and one for develolment tinkering. That way, if I lock up emacs doings someting in dev, I don't lose my erc sessions when I have to kill the process.

[01:04:55] <TRS-80> I suppose you mean the window tree, or new window algorithm, or whatever, as keybindings can easily be chainged in any of these.
[01:05:02] <TRS-80> I have come to appreciate tiling
[01:05:03] <parsnip> i have bindings to move floating windows around
[01:05:06] <parsnip> resize, etc
[01:05:09] <Catie> I've got StumpWM set up for window management similar to i3, I'm a huge fan of it
[01:05:13] <TRS-80> but it certainly was an adjustment
[01:05:24] <Demosthenex> i adore stumpwm
[01:05:41] <mwnaylor> I only know a bare minimum of Haskell, just to make minor tweaks to my xmonad.hs file.
[01:05:47] <TRS-80> I actually used StumpWM a long time ago, but I think back then I wasn't quite ready for it.  lol
[01:06:27] <Demosthenex> in fact, i just posted a module for spatial grouping in stumpwm with a draft demonstration video. https://osdn.net/users/rladams/pf/StumpWMSpatial/wiki/FrontPage

[01:07:23] <markofcorn> Used gnome with a tiling extension for a bit on wayland
[01:07:28] <Demosthenex> tiling rocks.
[01:07:50] <TRS-80> I like it, but it is whole different mentality at first
[01:07:50] <parsnip> default keybindings for arbitrary resizing of windows? i mean i have bindings that resize and move in increments along x or y axis, and move windows to next monitor
[01:08:15] <Demosthenex> i rarely resize windows. i just flip to another screen
[01:08:29] <TRS-80> parsnip: not to certain sizes, I mean top half, left half, other monitor and stuff like that
[01:08:30] <parsnip> hmm, i need bindings that will snap a corner of a window to a corner of a screen
[01:08:36] <parsnip> like, for each of the four corners
[01:08:40] <TRS-80> yes things like that
[01:08:50] <mwnaylor> If I would have a need for floating windows, I would drop back to XFCE.
[01:08:51] <parsnip> TRS-80: yeah to me that is tilish
[01:08:51] <Demosthenex> tiling means never having to worry about organizing windows :P
[01:08:52] <Catie> Demosthenex: I've been following along with that! It's appreciated very much
[01:09:05] <parsnip> i want arbitrary control of floating windows
[01:09:09] <Demosthenex> Catie: yeah, i've been impressed about the reception of it =]
[01:09:09] <TRS-80> parsnip: yes I agree, which is why I eventually went to i3 from that lol

[01:09:46] <parsnip> i guess i never bothered to try it
[01:09:47] <Demosthenex> Catie: i've tried to explain how it works, repeatedly, on the stumpwm channel over the years. i finally made a video to demonstrate, and everyone goes "oh! i get it"
[01:09:49] <grym> i use mod+mouse clickydraggy
[01:09:51] <grym> works fine
[01:10:03] <parsnip> i think i would toggle i3wm windows to float, then control with mouse
[01:10:07] <TRS-80> it has a whole IPC you can also control via various languages, shell, etc.
[01:10:08] <markofcorn> parsnip: On floating WM's I usually bind my keys like nethack. hjkl for tiling it to half the screen, yubn for corners

[01:11:03] <acdw> i really like herbstluft tho, i'm slowly working on a config for it
[01:11:05] <parsnip> i mean keeping size of window, i want to snap the window to a corner
[01:11:11] <acdw> thought about doing an autostart.el but .... that might be too much lol
[01:11:15] <parsnip> that would make my current setup a little nicer
[01:11:48] <mwnaylor> What is the inspiration for yubn keys? I'm familiar w/ hjkl from my vim days.
[01:12:17] <parsnip> hmm, or instead of special binding, would be nice if when i move window (with keyboard) to close to a corner, maybe it automatically snaps, assuming "one corner" is well-defined
[01:12:45] <parsnip> mwnaylor: maybe i and m are already used

[03:20:11] <TRS-80> Anyone know how to export from Org to Info?
[03:21:02] <edrx> I don't but I would like to know
[03:21:38] <ngz> TRS-80: (require 'ox-texinfo) is a good start.
[03:22:00] <edrx> update on the workshop that I gave this week:
[03:22:50] <ngz> TRS-80: From now on the export menu will contain an option to export to Texinfo or Info.
[03:24:13] <edrx> so: the first session - on tuesday - was very bad. Very few people came and they gave no feedback besides that they we there in the Telegram channel and that they were trying to learn the things that I was proposing. I was very frustrated at the end but I was only able to write a message to the students about that a few hours later
[03:24:19] <TRS-80> ngz: I did.  I also installed texinfo package (in Debian).  No joy, yet.
[03:26:12] <edrx> long story short, I said that I was feeling that I was being treated as someone who answers RTFM-ishly a lot and who expects people to read 2000 pages before they send any questions. And I said that I would reduce the second session from two hours to 30 minutes.
[03:27:30] <edrx> the second session was GREAT. only two people came - a student that uses eev a lot and one that had never used it before... and who uses Doom Emacs, and I only discovered that at the end of the first session.
[03:27:50] <TRS-80> well glad to hear the second one went better :)
[03:28:06] <ngz> TRS-80: You may want to first check if an example Org document is properly translated to Texinfo.
[03:28:08] <edrx> thanks! yes, it was fantastic!!!
[03:28:52] <TRS-80> ngz: It seems to be.  I guess this is the .text file?
[03:28:59] <TRS-80> .texi rather
[03:29:01] <ngz> Indeed.
[03:29:10] <edrx> let me call them A - the one who knows emacs and eev well and who was there mostly tp watch and help - and B - the other one.
[03:29:34] <TRS-80> error seems like it's calling the wrong binary, or no argument to make file or something like that
[03:29:54] <ngz> You may want to change `org-texinfo-info-process' to fix the binary
[03:30:12] <TRS-80> thanks, you saved me searching for that! :)
[03:30:47] <ngz> AFAIK, the default value usually works. Maybe your system is a bit exotic.
[03:31:00] <edrx> so: I asked B to try this:
[03:31:04] <edrx> rm -Rv /tmp/fake-home-dir/; mkdir /tmp/fake-home-dir/; cd /tmp/fake-home-dir/; HOME=$PWD emacs
[03:31:16] <edrx> oops, emacs -Q
[03:31:26] <edrx> just to make sure =)
[03:32:35] <TRS-80> ngz: OK, the value was correct actually.
[03:32:51] <edrx> and his emacs wouldn't start because gtk couldn't load the support for xpm
[03:33:45] <TRS-80> It seems that makeinfo is running, but all I get for errors is: https://bpa.st/7Z6Q
[03:33:45] <edrx> we didn't have time to try to fix that in the right way, so I asked him to rename his ~/.emacs.d/ to something else and start emacs by clicking the usual icons.
[03:34:30] <ngz> TRS-80: Does it work with a simpler document?
[03:34:45] <TRS-80> edrx: I don't think I would have the patience for that
[03:34:52] <TRS-80> ngz: good idea, lemme try
[03:35:03] <TRS-80> I was wondering if title is required maybe or?
[03:35:30] <ngz> My texinfo is a bit rusty.
[03:36:09] <edrx> we fixed the other problems very quickly too, and in a few minutes the eev functions that download local copies of .mp4s and play them with mpv were working

[03:40:51] <TRS-80> This is cool, now using Info to browse my sample file with 3 headings.  But it works!
[03:41:06] <TRS-80> I think I will try and fix those errors in original and see what happens.
[03:41:32] <edrx> at the end of the second session B was doing the exercises that involve defuns in the elisp tutorial that comes with eev. I couldn't stay besides the two hours, but he told me that he didn't understand the examples that involved &optional and &rest
[03:42:44] <edrx> considering that one of his questions in the beginning of the lisp part was what was the difference between (11 22) and (list 11 22) I think that it all went very well
[03:43:01] <edrx> =) =) =)
[03:43:04] <edrx> and that's it.

Any idea why that might be? The variable in question is `flycheck-python-mypy-executable` and Emacs says it's "risky" **.

[04:28:05] <TRS-80> although what sort of button are we talking about herE?
[04:28:44] <twb> preferably ivory or matchwood.  Four holes.  Round or semiround, with a lintle.
[04:28:49] <hashfuncadb> just the default `push-button` in a man mode buffer
[04:29:19] <TRS-80> OK, maybe there is a setting in man-mode
[04:29:29] <TRS-80> to open in same window or whatever
[04:30:30] <hashfuncadb> i think it would be incredibly useful to use `universal-argument` in some way to force the next action to apply to the current window that the cursor is in. i don't how that would cause any non-trivial problems

[07:19:32] <corwin> Anyway, perl makes it very easy to build my own versions of tee(1) on as needed so my next move is consolidating most of the packaging process down to a single perl-script that uses some sort of crude state machine to summarize direct output from different "phases" of a given job.
[07:20:11] <corwin> I had to get textinfo working it is required to package manuals so I should be half-way there!

[07:26:02] <corwin> The custom init script basically sets `erc-autojoin-channels-alist' and then calls (erc-tls ) with settings for this net.

[07:29:42] <corwin> Sorry.  Terrible mess here, but .. it's not very complicated.  As you say create a macro or function, save that to a file on your load-path then create an alias or shell script that calls emacs instructing it to require/load-library your script.

[07:35:55] <corwin> seems rather reasonable to me but I can see always wanting to start ERC with Emacs too.
[07:36:59] <tyson2> I don't always want erc running.  Some intensive processes cause erc to barf.
[07:37:22] <corwin> I don't do that because I don't have a way to keep erc-track from messing with the mode-line buffers in frames that have no ERC buffers already in them.  I put the Emacs frame with ERC in onto separate physical display.
[07:37:43] <tyson2> got it.  I use erc-status-sidebar
[07:38:08] <tyson2> which is now officially in emacs (as of 28)
[07:38:16] <corwin> tyson2: I've had that problem too although not recently.  My hacks on ERC often do crash emacs tho and it sux to have reload everything and reconnect where I'm actually chatting.
[07:38:57] <tyson2> I have keystrokes to start and stop erc, and I find that useful, also when suspending the notebook

[07:43:40] <corwin> Ah, in org there is a setting to get proper indentation, although I'm not sure I remember it.
[07:43:50] <tyson2> how to you start editing the codeblock, Arvydas ?
[07:44:14] <Arvydas> <s then hit tab and then write emacs-lisp. And write code in there

[11:08:40] <afidegnum> hi, what's the difference between wid-edit and widget package ?
[11:09:37] <bpalmer> the rough split is that widget has code to define widget types and wid-edit actually defines a bunch, as I recall.
[11:10:43] <afidegnum> ok
[11:11:29] <parsnip> i keep telling my cat to heel, and he looks at me like i'm stupid
[11:11:35] <parsnip> "with these?"
[11:11:56] <parsnip> all hail the widget
[11:11:58] <wasamasa> ;; This file only contains the code needed to define new widget types. Everything else is autoloaded from `wid-edit.el'.
[11:12:39] <wasamasa> ;; The widget library is partially documented in the `widget' Info file.
[11:13:39] <afidegnum> so if I understand, the widget library consists of the interface, and additional functioanlities are defined in wid-edit ?

[22:58:42] <parsnip> interactive elisp prompt buffer, i guess?
[22:59:04] <parsnip> i usually recommend it when i want someone to check a value in emacs, and i'm not sure how long they've been using emacs for
[22:59:29] <parsnip> for example, i could have just asked, "what is C-h v package-archives RET"
[23:00:04] <Arvydas> oh yeah, outputs the same info. But ielm is more clean. easier for a beginner like me I guess :)
[23:00:06] <parsnip> also, i wanted to know the current value of package-archives was, not what you believed it to be based on your configuration
[23:00:43] <parsnip> some people say, "a thing was not available to emacs!"
[23:00:51] <parsnip> but ielm indicates it's available
