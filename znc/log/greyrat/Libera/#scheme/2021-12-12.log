[00:07:01] <amazigh> c2.wiki seems back at http://wiki.c2.com/?RuntimeMacro
[00:07:10] <amazigh> with a nice frontend.
[00:07:24] <amazigh> Are runtime macro related to er and ir macros?

[01:08:17] <dpk> jcowan: could there be a write-in field? i have Thoughts™ about List Surgery
[01:08:54] <dpk> actually, i think they're too long to fit in a Google Forms box. i should probably write them out more fully than a terse note on the ultraviolet issues page and also having mentioned them here once to Zipheir 
[01:11:35] <amazigh> jcowan: good idea to have a pool. I already voted.
[01:11:36] <dpk> re the volunteer field for Levenshtein distance, any reason not to use (chibi edit-distance)?

[01:20:07] <dpk> jcowan: you don't need a "volunteer" field for syntax-case extensions, as (a) there's a full portable implementation in the document itself and (b) i intend to submit it as a SRFI myself once the Yellow ballot is done (though i will only do so if the straw poll comes out in favour)
[01:20:24] <dpk> assuming, that is, the Yellow ballot comes out in favour of syntax-case, but i think that's a dead cert at this point
[01:21:30] <dpk> (i note one nonsensical answer write-in answer to that question on the yellow ballot suggests someone there would like to have syntax-case-extensions, but lacks the actual knowledge of syntax-case to know that they actually need it)
[01:32:44] <sham1> The lexical macros seem interesting. Would this basically mean that one could do custom read syntax for objects?

[02:26:12] <opalvaults2> I'm having trouble deciding on a lisp/scheme to create a web application in. Any opinions on scheme (or lisp) with good full stack libraries (frontend/db/backend)? So far the options I've researched are Racket, Guile, and Common Lisp. They all seem fairly capable and I think Guile would be a more uphill battle for this purpose? Racket and Common Lisp seem to have fine libraries for this. Any other suggestions? Chez is one I haven't
[02:26:12] <opalvaults2> looked at yet.  
[02:27:05] <ecraven> if you want to do frontend in lisp as well, I doubt you'll find anything better than CL's paredit
[02:27:12] <ecraven> sorry, not paredit, parenscript
[02:27:23] <opalvaults2> Oh, also stipulation is that is has to be GPL compat
[02:27:36] <opalvaults2> ecraven: I'll take a look at that.
[02:27:38] <wasamasa> uhh
[02:27:39] <ecraven> I've done lots of backend work in chez, but mostly writing my own libraries
[02:27:43] <wasamasa> what would be not GPL compatible?
[02:27:49] <opalvaults2> Clojure
[02:28:00] <wasamasa> well then
[02:28:07] <wasamasa> I occasionally do web stuff with CHICKEN
[02:28:53] <opalvaults2> I've never heard of Chicken, I'll take a look as well. thank you :)

[02:30:24] <opalvaults2> ecraven: this looks really promising.
[02:32:32] <ecraven> well, it is CL, so it has its own problems :P
[02:32:48] <ecraven> but it is supposed to mostly let you share code between frontend and backend
[02:33:04] <ecraven> I've never used it for anything except trivial tests, not sure how well it actually works
[02:33:28] <dpk> "Parenscript is a translator from an extended subset of Common Lisp to JavaScript", ah, yes, the most meaningless phrase ever
[02:34:19] <dpk> check out my extended subset of Scheme. the only forms are cons, car, cdr, eqv?, and a non-deterministic version of if which depends on the phase of the moon called mif
[02:34:47] <wasamasa> a bit miffed
[02:34:57] <ecraven> dpk: it supposedly supports parts of CLOS, so you can share meaningful amounts of code, I've heard ;)
[02:39:03] <opalvaults2> I mentioned this in #commonlisp but color me a bit surprised lisp doesn't have a more straightforward answer for this type of development.

[02:39:26] <wasamasa> I didn't have the impression they're much into web stuff
[02:39:44] <opalvaults2> It's kind of a huge chunk of application development.
[02:39:53] <opalvaults2> kind of is now an understatement.
[02:40:48] <ecraven> well, all the backend stuff can be done in almost any Scheme.. most have database interfaces and ways to generate HTML
[02:41:30] <ecraven> frontend work can only be done in JS or something that compiles to JS, so your options vary there.. but be aware that there are some Schemes that are hosted in Javascript, so maybe those might work for you? Biwascheme I remember, but there are others

[03:36:22] <mdhughes_> opalvaults2: CHICKEN has awful, which is not awful. But the overly obvious choice is Clojure (back-end) and Clojurescript (front-end).
[03:41:32] *** Joins: jwd_ (~jwd@23.252.56.93)
[03:45:53] <jcowan> To be fair, compiling from X to Y when they don't match semantically is almost always going to involve an extended subset.  There will be X features that can't be translated into Y well, and there will be Y features that X programmers in the new environment will need.

I am a bit newer to web development so I am learning the hard way that javascript is hard to avoid, if not impossible.. I'm gonna see how much I can script on the frontend without javascript (cgi or something?). It's just a simple web interface to interact with a ticket system on the backend+sqlite db

[20:38:25] <sonny> Why is it that + only requires one parameter on foldl? (foldl + 0 '(1 2 3))
[20:41:02] <sonny> That is supposed to happen right? It would need 2 for a function of 3 arguments, and 3 paramteres for a function of 4 arguments, and so on
[20:49:33] <sham1> What do you mean
[20:50:10] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[20:50:46] <sham1> That executes as (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3) at least conceptually
[20:51:04] <sham1> That's why you provide the initial value of the accumalator
[20:52:11] <sonny> I do not know what I mean to ask, but your example makes sense

[21:45:59] <Zipheir> sonny: Have you looked at The Little Schemer?  That can be a good book for making sense of all the flavors of list recursion, IMO.
[21:47:14] <sonny> it seemed like a joke at the time but I guess I can revist it
[21:47:36] <sham1> Why would it be a joke

[21:50:34] <Zipheir> Some have said that The Little Schemer "is for 8-year old graduate students".  I don't agree, but I can see how you might get that odd impression.
[21:52:05] <Zipheir> No doubt it's the Felleisenisms.
[21:52:42] <sonny> sham1: have you read the first 3 pages, and have seen the layout / format? was my impression at first
[21:54:37] <Zipheir> Plato and Galileo wrote in dialogue form, so what's the big deal?
[21:56:12] <sonny> you assume I've read greek philosophers :P

[21:58:24] <sonny> ah :P
[21:58:51] <sonny> I just thought it was silly, but I should revist it and get a new opinion 
[22:00:39] <Zipheir> I recommend it.  The rest of the series is good, too.  I like Reasoned Schemer and Little Typer the best.
