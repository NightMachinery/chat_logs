[07:03:41] <twb> dfcnvt: oh, so either 1) they will have their eyes cut out; or 2) they will be taxed AT LEAST tuppence
[07:03:57] <dfcnvt> 1)  Anyone who make under $400,000 will not pay any taxes. (zero taxes)...However, if anybody make it OVER $400,000 then they are required to pay taxes in whatever percentage is set by the government.

[07:04:20] <twb> dfcnvt: "go up" not "will be zero"
[07:04:36] <dfcnvt> 2)  Anyone who make under $400,000 will pay an UNCHANGED amount of taxes (still pay nonetheless but won't increase).
[07:05:05] <twb> dfcnvt: what he's trying to say is that the marginal tax rate will not increase for below 400,000$
[07:05:20] <twb> dfcnvt: it's 100% definitely #2
[07:05:25] <dfcnvt> Right, I figured...but I guess, I would need to look into the bracket to learn what is that percentage?  Same as ever...or it'll be different from this point forward?
[07:05:34] <twb> dfcnvt: the key is "go up"
[07:05:58] <twb> dfcnvt: unfortunately he is probably talking about America, where taxation is kept deliberately confusing
[07:06:29] <twb> dfcnvt: so I can't easily say "it's 0% for the first 20,000$, then 5% for the next 100,000$, then ..."

[07:28:57] <dfcnvt> I'm a terrible person to make a discussion about this -- but I'm just in the form of frustration by the current system that isn't really up to their game...and I don't think they want to because...uhh, they want money that work in their system...And not really to "serve" to the citizen or really think ahead of the game that will saves the entirety of us.

[07:42:51] <dfcnvt> To my deep core of understanding for this solutions -- is basically a maintenance to every tree in the city -- any health that is in bad shape would be in a need of maintenance...
[07:43:40] <dfcnvt> But, instead, it just go forward with email and let people arbitrary fills with nonsenses.

[07:44:42] <dfcnvt> Could have just limited the inputs by having the scale of health, 1 to 100...but whoever is the citizen an expert in tree?  How can they know if it's dying during the winter when it is normal for no leaf?
[07:44:58] <dfcnvt> Bah -- let's not waste our breath on this one.
[07:45:26] <dfcnvt> I'm scrolling through each challenge here on this page >> https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges
[07:45:45] <twb> What, you think no Melburnians are arborists?
[07:47:00] <twb> You think trees can't read email?  What about santa?  Also what about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_to_plant_communication_via_mycorrhizal_networks
[07:47:09] * dfcnvt stares blankly at twb
[07:47:44] <twb> My mum also uses this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Send_Solve
[07:48:03] <twb> It's basically a checklist to help you report an issue to the correct entity
[07:48:20] <twb> Like if you see a bus on fire or a dog fighting a small child
[07:48:58] <dfcnvt> That's more like it -- I like the SSS solutions -- 
[07:49:15] <dfcnvt> This is more in gear of C2G (Citizen to Government)
[07:49:46] <dfcnvt> I suppose, I'd like to take a look at the sample of categorization and learn what can government do to serve -- if reported?
[07:50:02] <twb> https://vimeo.com/563955868  shows what the UX is like
[07:51:27] <dfcnvt> Very nice.
[07:52:56] <dfcnvt> Now, we just need to postcard to every citizen...detailed on the installation of app, what it for, and what can be reported...That'll motivate them to go outside and snap like crazy.
[07:53:31] <twb> dfcnvt: why kill so many trees?  What about homeless people?
[07:53:57] <twb> dfcnvt: since it only works for people who have access to a smartphone, you might as well tell them via smartphone comms
[07:54:49] <dfcnvt> They might be motivated to buy a smartphone if they feels there's something that need a reporting.
[07:55:19] <dfcnvt> Part of me think they'll neglect and do nothing about it.
[07:55:52] <dfcnvt> Is there a map that shows the volume of reports?  Like a heatmap
[07:56:17] <dfcnvt> ...Just to "help" the government to make a priority easier.
[07:56:54] <twb> dfcnvt: ask them

[08:07:46] <dfcnvt> I think I lack sorely on the relationship between me as a citizen to the government -- I'm talking about getting benefits for certain things (A house, bills, free money if there's one, medical coverage, uhh food, what else...?)

[22:02:21] <ash_worksi> is the saying "aim for the moon and you might hit the stars" ?
[22:02:48] <ash_worksi> or is it "aim for the stars and you might hit the moon" ?
[22:03:08] <blkshp> Never heard of it
[22:03:19] <blkshp> reac for the stars I have heard of but nothing with moon in it.
[22:03:48] <looney> ash_worksi, did you google it?
[22:04:05] <ash_worksi> yes, but nothing authoritative as far as I could find
[22:04:17] <blkshp> looney: Though this seems a standard thing to do, we rather not ask such things of people here.
[22:04:48] <inhahe_> ash_worksi: pretty sure it's the second one. that's the one that makes sense, and i think it's whaht i've heard.
[22:05:01] <ash_worksi> well, they both make sense to me, in different ways
[22:05:33] <looney> blkshp, I just asked because I tryed googling it, and all the results are clearly about aiming for the moon, so I was wondering why it was confusing
[22:05:59] <looney> I'd never heard of it, anyway
[22:06:14] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@user/great-taste/x-5798414)
[22:06:19] <ash_worksi> the former as "if you have big aspirations, you might become something even greater" and the latter "have really big aspirations and you might become something not as great but still great"
[22:06:22] <inhahe_>  oh, i guess i'm wrong, my search shows aim for the moon too
[22:06:27] <blkshp> Ok, that's fine but could you say that next time. It's just on a lot of channels I'm on, people ask a technical question and people sarcastically say "just google it" and it's one of those rules :)

[22:15:16] <ash_worksi> there is a reference specifically to "W. Clement Stone" but I couldn't find any better than 1 result on penbookcenter.com
[22:15:40] <ash_worksi> and of course there might be variations, like reach/aim/shoot ... shrug
[22:19:45] <looney> "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars". That's one version. Another one: "Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star." However, an American rapper released an album called "Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon"
[22:21:06] <looney> so to sum up I'd say: aim for the moon or for the stars, it doesn't matter because you'll die anyway as soon as you are out of the atmosphere

[23:23:36] <skyfall> It it correct to use "makes a better job"?

[23:44:41] <GuiToris> Today I was told something like 'I show a mirror to you'
[23:44:46] <GuiToris> but I don't exactly how it exactly was
[23:44:51] <GuiToris> do you have a phrase like that?
[23:45:05] <blkshp> cool story bro
[23:45:17] <blkshp> Nope, sorry, not sure of the context.
[23:45:23] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: Maybe "hold a mirror up to you"?
[23:45:51] <GuiToris> kurahaupo, does it mean that she will behave like the way I behave toward to her?
[23:46:05] <kurahaupo> (it's not the mirror that's on show, it's what's reflected in it that matters)
[23:46:43] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: It could be used that way metaphorically, yes
[23:46:53] <GuiToris> thank you very much :)

[23:59:25] <dfcnvt> darsie: The best course of action is to clean in its entirely -- throw away the things you don't need -- vaccuum, vaccuum, vaccuum and literally kills any bedbug you see in sights -- and if you have found a nest of bedbugs -- REMOVE by taking the material within all together and take it outside and throwaway -- preferably put into a plastic black bag (that is, if it's small enough to fit in)...otherwise
