[18:12:11] <bencc1> if I have 15fps and I want to convert it to 30fps, I'll push frames in to the filter and request frame of specific pts/dts?

[18:14:34] <bencc1> filter like this? http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/filtering_8c-source.html
[18:15:16] <Mavrik> bencc1, yes, the API behind CLI "-vf" command
[18:15:24] <Mavrik> Read up on the CLI first to understand how it works.
[18:15:32] <Mavrik> But essentially you define a filter chain with strings
[18:15:39] <Mavrik> And then you push in frames and pull them out on the other end
[18:15:40] <bencc1> I've used the cli with filters
[18:15:53] <Mavrik> fps filter will duplicate / drop frames and return frames with correct(ish) timestamps
[18:16:07] <bencc1> ok. thanks

[19:36:26] <k_sze> I'm trying this: `ffmpeg -loglevel warning -i foo.flac -c:a libfdk_aac -vbr 5 foo.aac` and I get these warnings:
[19:36:35] <k_sze> [flac @ 0x7fa48300d200] Discarding ID3 tags because more suitable tags were found.
[19:36:43] <k_sze> [libfdk_aac @ 0x7fa484001e00] Note, the VBR setting is unsupported and only works with some parameter combinations
[19:37:04] <k_sze> What do these mean?
[19:37:12] <furq> the flac warning means your flac file has id3 tags for some reason
[19:37:22] <furq> but that it also has vorbis comments so it's ignoring the id3 tags
[19:37:26] <k_sze> blame Exact Audio Copy
[19:37:29] <furq> not that it matters because raw aac doesn't support metadata anyway
[19:37:40] <furq> the fdk warning is always printed if you use -vbr
[19:37:44] <k_sze> ok, so if I want metadata, I should use .mp4?
[19:37:46] <furq> if you're not using he-aac or something you can just ignore it
[19:37:52] <furq> and yeah you should generally use m4a for aac
[19:38:00] <k_sze> oh, m4a
[19:38:21] <k_sze> "not using he-aac"?

[19:39:25] <furq> it's for low bitrate stuff and it sucks
[19:41:37] <k_sze> :/
[19:43:07] <furq> like i said you can just ignore it, vbr works fine for lc-aac (the default)
[19:43:31] <k_sze> I kinda need help choosing my encoding options. I'm encoding for playback on a car stereo system, but the car manufacturer sucks and doesn't provide proper technical specs of the car stereo. It only says it supports AAC.
[19:43:59] <k_sze> I guess I'll just use -vbr 5 and cross my fingers?
[19:44:07] <furq> yeah
[19:44:18] <furq> i don't think stereos only supporting cbr is a thing with aac

[19:45:26] <furq> devices like that will always find new and exciting ways to disappoint
[19:45:29] <k_sze> It does support MP3, but no Vorbis, no Opus, no FLAC.
[19:45:32] <znf> Never heard of a car entertainment system to support AAC but no MP3, it's usually the other way around
[19:45:33] <znf> Ah
[19:45:41] <k_sze> BMW sucks. This is a new car we're talking about.
[19:45:50] <znf> you'll find that almost nothing supports Vorbis/Opus/FLAC etc. :)

I've succeeded to transcode a video in H.265 using the "main" profile, but I now try to compare to what the "main10" profile can produce.  My first try gets me a video with green colors, which looks like a "pixel format" issue.

[23:01:14] <znf> but a simple explanation: your input and output are different pixel formats, so you need to convert in between them, most hwaccell stuff doesn't have a filter that only does pixel formats, as far as I know, so you invoke scaling
[23:02:00] <znf> furq's first example converts pixel formats directly on the hardware, while the 2nd one, I believe, converts it in software (ie: on the CPU, in the system memory), and it gets uploaded back to the vram (on the gpu)

[23:33:47] <znf> if this works, I'm gonna try to do libnpp_static for my needs, too
[23:33:57] <znf> I'll most likely end up wasting the whole night
[23:37:05] <znf> compressing this with xz takes longer than the rest of my actual build process
[23:37:50] <furq> don't use -9 then
[23:38:07] <znf> the script does!
[23:38:22] <furq> change the script then
[23:38:29] <znf> it actually doesn't, it uses: tar cJf "${ARTIFACTS_PATH}/${OUTPUT_FNAME}" "$BUILD_NAME"
[23:38:49] <furq> is it setting XZ_OPT
[23:38:55] <znf> nope
[23:39:49] <znf> oh man, I absolutely love this script
[23:39:55] <furq> maybe set XZ_OPT="-6 --threads=0"
[23:40:38] <znf> does --threads actually work for xz these days?
[23:41:03] <znf> long time ago the option did nothing
[23:41:05] <furq> it works for compressing largeish files
[23:41:13] <furq> it doesn't do anything for decompressing
[23:42:30] <furq> apparently it just splits it into blocks and compresses them independently so i guess it'll lose a fair bit of efficiency
[23:43:53] <znf> I still see it only use "100%" CPU
[23:44:01] <znf> in top
[23:45:04] <znf> heh, started compressing at 20:13:05 my server time, ended 20:14:59
[23:45:21] <znf> total time (as recorded by `time`): 3m20.887s :D
[23:45:56] <znf> I'll just change it to gzip for my own purposes
[23:46:29] <znf> wish I didn't need scale_npp and call it a day :(
[23:46:55] <znf> JEEB, is glslang needed for the _vaapi filters?
[23:47:09] <JEEB> I think it's only relevant to vulkan
[23:47:45] <JEEB> yea, if you `git grep "glslang" -- configure`
[23:47:51] <JEEB> you can only see _vulkan things there
[23:48:07] <JEEB> it's a shader thing, while vaapi is just its own library interface
[23:51:06] <znf> I seem to have made a mistake somewhere in my logic, seems the scripts themselves for each library check if the variant is "gpl", else they disable themselves
[23:51:54] <znf> guess I could use gpl-nonfree as a name, if that doesn't break anything else
[23:52:56] <JEEB> nonfree is a really bad name for that option, since it's really "non-distributable". if you look at its history it was there for *open* *source* things that just happened to have an incompatible license with, f.ex., GPL
[23:53:18] <JEEB> like openssl until it became dual licensed with apache v2
[23:53:22] <JEEB> or fdk-aac
[23:53:53] <znf> BtbN mentioned something about openssl support and the fact that nobody changed the configure to include it without non-free
[23:54:02] <JEEB> yea
[23:54:15] <JEEB> someone would have to check the first version with the new dual licensing
[23:54:25] <JEEB> and just update the configure to take it like apache v2
[23:54:43] <JEEB> so far funny enough nobody apparently using openssl with libavformat cared?
[23:55:24] <znf> I'm not sure how to actually enable it tough
[23:55:31] <znf> the script is only ffbuild_enable() { return 0 }
[23:55:54] <BtbN> got to wait for OpenSSL 3.0 before that can be done
[23:56:02] <BtbN> That's where they change the license to not be non-free anymore
[23:56:14] <JEEB> I tought they already did the dual license thing?
[23:56:18] <JEEB> *thought
[23:56:45] <znf> but shouldn't me passing non-free to configure pick openssl automatically?
[23:56:58] <JEEB> no
[23:57:01] <furq> it doesn't pick any tls library automatically
[23:57:11] <JEEB> the TLS libraries all IIRC were manual enables
[23:57:15] <furq> right
[23:57:17] <znf> or is the script never being run because it returns 0 thus the image never includes the actual ssl libs?
[23:57:46] <znf> mkay, then I guess I need to patch it
[23:57:48] *** Quits: flemingjp (~flemingjp@85.210.32.88) (Quit: Quit)
[23:57:52] <JEEB> apparently the OS provided libraries on macOS and Windows are auto-detected
[23:58:08] <znf> but nothing on linux
[23:59:00] <JEEB> since linux users usually want something specific, I guess?
[23:59:04] <JEEB> ┐(´д｀)┌
[23:59:13] <JEEB> gnutls at least is LGPL
