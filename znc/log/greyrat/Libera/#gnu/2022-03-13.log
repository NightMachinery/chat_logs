[08:03:38] <epony> UNIX >> WIN/DOS > MAC/DOS
[08:04:41] <epony> FON/DOS is irrelevant
[08:05:52] <epony> the main reason for this is, lack of standardisation and compatibility in inferior systems (incompatible and non-interoperable)
[08:06:20] <epony> standards and portability are more important than brands and services
[08:07:52] <epony> software without source is not reproducible, hardware without source is not reproducible, firmware without source is not reprooducible, services without source is not reproducible
[08:08:13] <epony> non-reproducible is non-sustainable and non-portable and non-standard
[08:08:42] <epony> irreproducible is dependence and failure of computing and organisation of computation
[08:12:06] <epony> therefore you need open and also free standards, and the rest of the above enumerated components of computing systems
[08:16:01] <tpefreedom> So does that mean it is best to work with what we have already rather than trying something new?
[08:17:05] <epony> new things become standards over time if they are correctly designed, modular-composable and worthy of propagation to other installations
[08:18:29] <epony> of course, it is important to do new research and development, in a reproducible, open and free, sustainable and standards-compliant and standards-inclusion directions
[08:18:40] <epony> standards can be improved too
[08:23:32] <tpefreedom> of course not everyone needs things like full timesharing support or very fine-grained permissions and on the other hand some things other OS families have like 'data types' (where you install a file with information about a file type and applications can take advantage of any data type (within reason probably) once the developer includes support for data types in the program)

[16:15:18] <noid> I understood that I have to release the whole project under GPLv3 if I put code in it that I license under GPLv3. However I am not sure if I can / have to relicense included Apache License 2.0 code under GPLv3
