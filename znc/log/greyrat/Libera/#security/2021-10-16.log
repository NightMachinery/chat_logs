[00:37:07] <piou> Joanna: still, since you don't seem to know very much about economics, you'll surely find interesting to know that there exists ways to do housing etc without debt. Since, as you pointed out, usury has beeen forbidden by Islamic law, we see even today some banks use a different system. Let's say you want to build a house. The bank is going to take your project and build the house with its own
[00:37:13] <piou> money. Then they will allow you to rent the house for X years (generating a profit on it). After this period they will sell you the house for effectively nothing. So if you decide to go through it's similar to having a loan: you pay money to the bank each months and ofter some time the house is fully yours. But some things are very different. In particular the bank owns the house until they sell
[00:37:19] <piou> it to you, you're not the owner. This means that you can leave whenever you want just as you would with any rent. This also means that the bank takes much more risks and therefore may dispute the specifics of how the house is built because they're the one that will build it and own it for several years, the want it to appeal to other people if required. So it's not without downsides, and it
[00:37:25] <piou> probably doesn't make as much money for the bank as a regular loan due to the increased risk, but the model is quite interesting.

Because creating money out of thin air is what we do everyday, we create hundred of billions of dollar every year, but the inflation (which measures the increase in price) doesn't go up proportionnaly, or even in a way that seems strongly correlated.

You can buy other currencies, so it has a value relative to these currencies, but that's probably not what you're talking about.

[01:30:16] *** Joins: HyN0X (~HyNoX@37.162.53.245)
[01:30:19] <piou> money creates inflation has been disproved many times by observation of real world fluctuations as well as theoretically.
[01:30:44] <piou> Admitedly these works are rather recent, they have less than 20 years for the majority, but they are present and coherent with what we see in practice.
[01:32:21] <piou> There is a correlation between creation of money and inflation, but it's not that strong of a link. In particular it seems that a very important and fast increase in the quantity of money is required to cause a sensible change in inflation. If anything inflation is actually lower than what most countries would like it to be (for different reasons we target 2%-3% yearly) and yet we're printing

[01:42:40] <piou> Joanna: nothing to do with how money is done
[01:43:56] <spanishsunrise> well when someone is keeping part of a value the value looses value
[01:44:24] <piou> One such advantage is that it provides governments an effective tool to deal with recessions. In periods of recessions the issue is rarely that there isn't enough money, but that money is stale, is doesn't circulate within the economy and therefore as everyone keeps their money for themselves it doesn't drive activity in general. What governments would like to do in such case is to inject money
[01:44:30] <piou> in the economy to motivate some consumption and have a bit more circulation of money, helping businesses getting some work. But with gold money you can't do that: either you have more gold than what is represented by the money in circulation (but that's a *huge* amount of gold) and then you can create some more money (but a limited amount) or you create money anyway and there, yes, devaluate your
[01:44:36] <piou> currency because a dollar (eg) will not represent as much gold. So you just can't inject more money in the economy and that removes a tool to deal with a global issue. In the case of debt money you absolutely can create money out of thin air without devaluating it, and since it'll be created as a debt to the central bank it's not a debt against anyone: no one expects that money back so it never
[01:44:42] <piou> has to be repayed. It's litterally new money to help people spend more in their local businesses, helping things get working again.
[01:46:09] <spanishsunrise> the economy is only living of debt debt creates value
[01:46:13] <piou> spanishsunrise: that's wrong in the general sense because it's not presented correctly. It's important to note that you're not keeping value, you're keeping assets, and these assets take more value in time (be it only due to inflation). So if you lend me $100 and a year later give me $100 I have lost about $2 because had I kept that money it would now be valued $102 at 2% inflation

[01:49:06] <TonyStone> all money is fake... and i personally dont care.  all of our financial systems will eventually fail... just do what you think is right.  dont invest too crazy into more fiat products... invest in real assetts where possible.  end of story.  NOW... oepnvpn? letsencrypt?  :)
[01:49:15] <piou> TonyStone: if it's personnal you'll generate the certificate yourself, so you can trust it manually, you don't need an external authority to tell you it's a valid certificate
[01:49:41] <TonyStone> valid point piou and its how i always felt... HOWEVER
[01:50:04] <TonyStone> there was a stack exchange i think where it was starting to be debated and i didnt understand.  let me find it
[01:50:07] <Joanna> A promise to repay <> gold coin
[01:50:29] <piou> Joanna: indeed, that's why gold currency should not be confused with debt currency
[01:50:43] <piou> Joanna: but we're not with gold today, and it's important to see what doors this opens
[01:50:59] <spanishsunrise> I like money TonyStone like we all do
[01:51:11] <Joanna> I’d prefer gold and silver tbh

[01:51:33] <piou> Joanna: they were very limited. I don't think you realize what that entails
[01:51:46] <piou> Joanna: in particular there weren't less debt with gold and silver you know

[01:53:13] <Phantom> hi there, I need an NVR and 5 good camera PoE, what do you guys recommend?
[01:53:15] <piou> It just happens that debt money gives us more possibilites to fight recessions, that it allows things like unlimited national debts without consequences, that it decorrelates the creation of money from inflation and allows much more money to be in circulation resulting in overall more exchanges
[01:53:30] <Joanna> There is just one advantage electronic money has over gold and that’s for sending money to far away places. But then there is the question is it a good idea to send money to faraway places..
[01:53:32] <piou> What it doesn't result in is more loan sharks
[01:53:57] <piou> Joanna: you're closing your eyes to the many other advantages

[01:55:03] <Joanna> piou: do you think it’s a wise choice to outsource manufacturing and agriculture to foreign countries?

[01:57:35] <piou> TonyStone: yeah, that thread doesn't encourage using a public CA at all
[01:57:36] <spanishsunrise> when asia loaned from the west the asians had their crash

[01:58:21] <TonyStone> i just thought it would be good to do since i had set it up to run on my haproxy
[01:58:25] <spanishsunrise> well china bought American debt with their loans
[01:59:20] <Joanna> Fiat currency is one of the  things driving moving things offshore in my opinion.
[01:59:56] <piou> spanishsunrise: I'm sure you mean china and not asia (beware of generalizations), China didn't have a real crash yet, they've been loaning money for the past 50 years so any crash would seem at first glance unrelated, and loans between currencies are much more complex than within one currency so it's a different debate altogether.

[02:04:15] <piou> The reason why you repay a debt is because otherwise the other party loses money. But if the debt was contracted to a central bank (as are in effect all debts related to money creation since central banks buy the debts from regular banks) then nobody is waiting for the money. It's not a debt to be repayed. And since most of the US national debt (for example) is made of such money creation most of

[02:42:37] <piou> Todays loans aren't perfect, but they're more regulated than they've ever been. Today's inflation may not please everyone but it's mild and even under what most consider a sane amount. Today's financial markets are wild but not as much as in the 30s (thankfully). And poverty is still terrible, but we're not yet thrown into medieval existence.

[04:09:16] <CoJaBo_> Whatever the correct term is then lol
[04:09:39] <Hash> Side channel involves intensive iformation gathering about the implementation of a system
[04:09:48] <Hash> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack
[04:09:48] <secbot> ^ In computer security, a side-channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself.
[04:09:58] <Hash> Timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited.
[04:10:11] <Hash> CoJaBo_: what did you do?
[04:10:12] <CoJaBo_> The OTP was properly implemented in that it used a purely random key (or at least, I assumed as much; it's up to the user to not do something dumb like email it), and the sending side had robust protection to never re-use any part of the key
[04:11:07] <Hash> OTP has a limited time span usually.
[04:11:18] <Hash> Not long enough to email and be used. Usually 30 seconds.
[04:11:21] <Hash> Or less.
[04:12:05] <CoJaBo_> The app apparently assumes you'll distribute the key via CD-R; it's fairly old lol
[04:12:14] <Hash> Oh wow.
[04:12:18] <Hash> That's the 90s for sure.

[04:19:51] <gartt> That's the problem with OTP. Properly implemented, it's almost completely impractical unless you ferry some locked down physical media somewhere else to share the "key"
[04:20:40] <CoJaBo_> Yeh, that's how this app was designed to be used. And they still managed to screw it up, but in a rather subtle way
[04:21:22] <gartt> But like I said, it's the *only* mathematically provably secure means to communicate if you put up with its massive limitations
[04:21:33] <CoJaBo_> One thing I don't see mentioned much is that OTP is still a stream cipher. So you can do stream cipher attacks on it if the app is just using OTP with no authentication

[04:26:20] <CoJaBo_> Basically, if you can guess the first dozen-ish bytes of a message (and there's some fixed-format things this app can send that make this reasonable to actually do), you can send your own arbitrary message. The recipient doesn't check for key reuse either, because a design assumption is that message transmission will be unreliable, some may get lost or duplicated

[06:53:24] <CoJaBo_> I don't remember if they took burnature, but they took boxes of office supplies
[06:53:31] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[06:53:34] <mats1> with the stuff i wanted on it, retails for ~$1500 iirc
[06:53:34] <CaCode> I think I am going to add more layers of security
[06:54:16] <CaCode> how comfortable is  an aeron chair?
[06:54:24] <CaCode> if it is a good chair that price is well worth it
[06:54:34] <CoJaBo_> CaCode: They were mostly going for the PCs, I'd imagine. Several dozen new-ish midrange PCs with monitors is still quite a lot of money, and easy to sell if you peel off the serial numbers
[06:54:53] <mats1> its worth it
[06:54:58] <CaCode> How much would you pay for used computers?
[06:55:09] <mats1> very little
[06:55:21] <CoJaBo_> Other than the MS-DOS PC (a circa 2006 Dell Dimension), the next most expensive item was the door. Office doors are expensive, apparently.
[06:55:26] <catbeard> there was this chair at staples that i sat in, leather, display model not for purchase :(, i sat and like almost slipped off was so comfy
[06:55:29] <catbeard> $300
[06:55:35] <CaCode> just that used category cuts the price by 80%
[06:56:01] <CoJaBo_> CaCode: That buys you enough meth to get thru the week tho
[06:56:16] <catbeard> if used sparingly, could last you a month
[06:56:29] <CoJaBo_> lol, "sparingly"
[06:56:39] <CaCode> smoke meth responsibly
[06:56:43] <catbeard> i mean you only have to do 1 handyman for like 2-3 days
[06:56:55] <CoJaBo_> Given the sanity levels of the people I encounter, there is no moderation involved here
[06:57:32] <CaCode> I do not understand why meth is so popular or its legal cousin aderall
[06:57:55] <CoJaBo_> The DOS PC was so expensive because we had to replace the industry-specific software it contained. The insurance company fought us and them to hell on that
[06:58:00] <CaCode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall
[06:58:01] <secbot> ^ Adderall and Mydayis are trade names for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine. The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which produces a ratio between dextroamphetamine and...
[06:58:05] <mats1> products of a failed state
[06:59:20] <CoJaBo_> People steal the darnedest things
[06:59:58] <CaCode> why not instead steal a famous painting, or million dollar car
[07:00:15] <CaCode> or just rob a bank like bonny and clyde
[07:00:24] <mats1> there's no money in banks anymore
[07:00:36] <CaCode> but there is money in banking ...
[07:00:38] <CaCode> hmmm
[07:00:42] <mats1> there's furniture
[07:01:00] <CoJaBo_> CaCode: Museums probably have security, and banks are essential businesses that remained open
[07:01:44] <CoJaBo_> This was in one of those business parks. Not a living soul in the area to snitch on them lol
[07:02:11] <mats1> doing meth and then stealing stuff kind of sounds fun
[07:02:37] <CoJaBo_> All you need is a van and a 6ft 2×4.
[07:02:48] *** Hash is now known as OpenSores
[07:03:19] <CoJaBo_> AFAIK, they never caught the guys either
[07:03:27] <mats1> see?
[07:03:40] <mats1> order me up one meth please
[07:03:52] <CoJaBo_> They had left pre-dusted fingerprints, faces visible on the cameras, and license plate was visible
[07:04:07] <CaCode> yet not caught?
[07:04:12] <CoJaBo_> Crime of the century this was not. But they still got away with it :/
