[11:03:20] <fsbot> Uh oh,  Symbol’s function definition is void: fs-kill-emacs
[11:03:35] <corwin> you are really calling fs-eval with that last, which is getting the forms after transformation.
[11:03:42] <nnnnn> I see

[11:43:43] <codingquark> edrx: Maxima looks like algebra system, am I parsing it right? Mathematica seems broader - since it now a days include things like NLP
[11:44:19] <edrx> codingquark: the most basic application for CASs is exactly that. you can make them calculate things that would take hours by hand, you can plot things, change parameters and see what changes, etc
[11:44:52] <edrx> I think that Mathematica is broader but I don't know exactly in what senses
[11:45:27] <codingquark> Perhaps it would be much better for me if I take up a project or problem to be explored and use one of these systems

[11:55:07] <edrx> so: I've tried to learn other CASs and they always gave the impression that they were useful when you had a job to do but they were mostly boring, and mostly made to make calculations that would be painful to do by hand less painful, and little more than that.

[12:09:14] <edrx> I see

[12:13:24] <hmw> BTW, in my C course students usually have to develop a C function to diff  mathematical functions. Usually I show code in emacs.

[12:14:58] <edrx> "show code in Emacs" means 1) you used Emacs to show your code in C? or 2) you showed code in Emacs Lisp?
[12:18:43] <artefact> oh wow, maxima. still my cas of choice because i learned it at uni
[12:19:18] <hmw> Show/implement/demonstrate C code in Emacs. Especially since we do online teaching I think it is very convenient to only have one window/frame to share. Some colleagues have to share a shell, an editor, maybe some viewers for their slides. Then it takes too much time to switch between all this windows and they start sharing their whole desktop with
[12:19:18] <hmw> the audience. Then all students see the teacher's private cat picture collection, notifiers containing names pop up etc. ppp.
[12:20:05] <hmw> So yes, in one window I usually can do everything I needed in a lecture.
[12:20:10] <artefact> your window manager doesn't have workspaces?

[12:27:08] <hmw> I come from the solaris world, but now I'm on linux.
[12:27:18] <artefact> i haven't had ms windows at home for 15+ years yet i still look like an alien at work when i'm able to take a screenshot or set the projector to extended desktop
[12:27:32] <artefact> computer literacy is *that bad*
[12:27:33] <edrx> I used solaris a bit in the university.
[12:27:45] <hmw> Or do you ask about the nonfree OS? No, that's not solaris.
[12:28:44] <artefact> in fact we're only two in the team who know tex. all the others use crappy ms word equations
[12:29:21] <artefact> hmw: i was joking about the other nonfree OS
[12:29:36] <hmw> artefact: I think a lot of people don't care if they can master their tools. It's like an mechanic don't know how to use a screwdriver.
[12:29:55] <artefact> i would agree but i'm also deep down in that camp. i use emacs for f*cks sake
[12:30:05] <artefact> nobody in their right mind can master emacs
[12:30:54] <edrx> I use XFCE4 here and I couldn't understand how to take screenshots with it, and every time that I tried to learn that again I ended up more frustrated... so I wrote a quick hack in Emacs.
[12:31:08] <hmw> artefact: I see. Well, I know a few people who installed solaris on their laptops a couple of years ago. But all switched to other OS sooner or later.
