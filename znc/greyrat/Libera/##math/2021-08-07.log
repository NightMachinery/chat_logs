[00:11:06] <int-e> You can add Adj^* as a primitive and the claim will trivially break down. Then again, you can't axiomatize Adj^* in terms of Adj, not even with an infinite set of axioms.
[00:11:18] <int-e> All because of compactness.
[00:13:22] <riv> i should learn this some day
[00:15:02] <dextaa> int-e: something like forall x_i forall (x_{i+1} (E x_i x_{i+1} -> E x_i x_{i+2}) ?
[00:15:19] <dextaa> guess i can't write x_i
[00:15:41] <riv> maybe we can use negation, de-morgan
[00:17:51] <int-e> dextaa: It's getting really hard to give hints on this without giving you the answer.

[05:52:09] <Z-module> laurus, well, technically speaking, if (x_n) in some metric space X is Cauchy but has no limit point in X, you can't yet talk about "its limit" at all. But there is always a space X^hat where X embeds isometrically and densely in X^hat, and now (x_n) does have a limit in this X^hat.
[05:52:44] <Z-module> this X^hat is the so-called completion of X
[05:53:21] <Z-module> and best of all, now not only do all the Cauchy sequences from X have a limit in X^hat, but so do all the Cauchy sequences of X^hat.

[05:55:45] <LTCD> We have two dies. What is chance of getting two sixes? I was told to identify the power set of two die. Each die has a cardinality of 6. In video they wrote |die1| + |die2| = 36 which makes no sense. For starters they used the plus symbol, and I also thought a power set of a die would be 2^6=64 each.
[05:56:53] <gry> LTCD: the first dice is six options; the second dice is antoher six options, making the total 36; but "2+3" is same as "3+2", so let's half it - we have 18 outcomes for throwing a dice; out of these 18 outcomes, one outcome is two sixes; the probability is 1/18th
[05:57:17] <gry> LTCD: that's my understanding - hope it is correct, i didn't check it against any literature
[05:57:22] <laurus> Also, showing that one can complete a metric space seems like just part of it, it seems like it would be necessary to also show that if a Cauchy sequence doesn't converge in a metric space, that the only reason is that it hasn't "yet been completed"
[05:57:48] <laurus> Or is does that second point not need to be proved due to something I'm not noticing?
[05:58:29] <LTCD> gry Why is it not 6 + 6 = 12?
[05:59:07] <Fangs> LTCD: the 'power set of two die' doesn't make immediate sense. while its true a die can have 6 outcomes, the set of all possible outcomes for a die should be 6, not 1^6 no?
[05:59:38] <int-e> it should be 6^2 = 6*6 = 64
[05:59:40] <Fangs> LTCD: not 2^6 rather
[05:59:51] <cherim> Are you all trolling?
[05:59:55] <laurus> cherim: I'm not

[06:00:07] <laurus> cherim: what is wrong with anything I said?

[06:03:17] <Z-module> laurus: not sure what you mean. You just carry out a construction of a completion, such as in that link (there are other ways too), and then you have it. There's no reason to ever talk about "reasons" for a Cauchy sequence not to converge.
[06:03:53] <Z-module> also you might like to know that any two completions of a metric space are themselves isometric by a map that is the identity on X. So it's a good "unique" sort of construction.

[06:41:07] <Z-module> yes, only R^n, in general (for closed & bounded)
[06:41:46] <laurus> I must go, thank you all for the discussion :)
[06:42:15] <SteamingCoreDump> the whole closed + bounded thing never made much sense to me it seems redundant (no, dont give me counterexamples of closed and unbounded), but it's just unsatisfactory
[06:42:26] <SteamingCoreDump> like a better definition or axiom is 'missing'

[06:43:05] <cherim> If every contraction map on a metric space has a fixed point, must the space be complete?
[06:43:13] <Z-module> I think the point is that it's often quite simple to check for those conditions, given some subset of R^n
[06:43:41] <SteamingCoreDump> bounded is easy to comprehend, but there's clearly some other 'machinery' people are swiping under rug with the whole 'closed' thing

[06:44:55] <Z-module> cherim, do you want to hear the answer? Or maybe just testing us?
[06:45:53] <SteamingCoreDump> closed is not a primitive and 'closed and unbounded sets' are all contrived examples
[06:45:54] <cherim> This was an exercise I postponed several times and never got to doing
[06:46:03] <Z-module> SteamingCoreDump: maybe not. If X is any compact subset of a hausdorff space, then X is automatically closed.
[06:46:49] <Z-module> but of course, in non-hausdorff spaces, all sorts of insane things can happen, like two compact subsets having non-compact intersection.

[06:55:02] <Fangs> you can quite easily show that if Av = c*v then B^k v is again an eigenvector with eigenvalue c, vice versa
[06:55:54] <cherim> A has an eigenvalue, say lambda. Then U=Ker(A-\lambda I) is nonempty; it's also invariant under B. So B is a linear operator on U, and has an eigenvector v there. Then v is also an eigenvector of A for lambda...
[06:55:55] <int-e> "vice versa" is questionable, but this is a good start. you only need k=1 to make progress

[06:56:20] <cherim> Again you try to express everything as polynomials in input, it's not how linear algebra works
[06:56:24] <Fangs> I tried making the question "simpler" by trying to prove this lemma: if AB = BA, then if (A+B)v = c*v, then there is a common eigenvector of A and B
[06:57:38] <SteamingCoreDump> Z-module: are there any applications of zarski topology outside of algebraic geometry?
[06:57:49] <SteamingCoreDump> or does it 'stand on its own'
[06:57:52] <int-e> "invariant" hmm, wouldn't that mean BU = U? (which may be false)
[06:58:09] <Fangs> BU c U is needed here
[06:58:16] <int-e> cherim: (nitpicking)
[06:58:28] <cherim> Typically means BU\subseteq U in what I learned from
[06:58:29] <int-e> Fangs: BU subset U is what you've shown
[06:58:42] <Fangs> int-e: I was nitpicking your nitpick
[06:58:43] <int-e> cherim: Okay.
[06:59:04] <cherim> Now try the rank(AB-BA)=1 thing...
[06:59:04] <int-e> Fangs: I know what's needed; evidently I don't know what "invariant" means.
[06:59:13] <int-e> I'm still stuck on that one.
[06:59:42] <cherim> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_subspace
[06:59:48] <Fangs> I need to get out of the habit of trying to work with only polynomials
[07:00:17] <Fangs> int-e: if you think of eigenspaces as invariant subspaces, then BU = U would require 0 to never be an eigenvalue
[07:00:31] <SteamingCoreDump> I remember when this guy invented zarski (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furstenberg%27s_proof_of_the_infinitude_of_primes) but is just a footnote in math
[07:00:36] <int-e> cherim: Well, I think it's an abuse of the word "invariant".
[07:00:46] <SteamingCoreDump> yet AG exploded somehow
[07:01:01] <int-e> cherim: But it is what it is, certainly not the first abuse of words in math, nor the last. Thanks for setting me straight.

[15:18:07] <int-e> Fangs: Okay, I have a solution of sorts, so looking now... No, that's not true. Take A = [1,0,0; 0,2,0; 0,0,3] and B = [0,-1,-1; 0,0,0; 0,0,0]. Then [A;B] = [0,1,2; 0,0,0; 0,0,0], [A;B] * (u,v,w)^T = (v+2*w) * (1,0,0)^T, so c((u,v,w)^T) = v+2w, but c(A(u,v,w)^T) = 2v+6w.
[15:21:35] <Fangs> int-e: what's c?
[15:21:46] <int-e> Fangs: your c.
[15:21:57] <Fangs> oh yeah
[15:21:58] <int-e> [A,B]v = c(v)*w
[15:22:14] <int-e> (different w, my bad)
[15:22:26] <int-e> (and v.)
[15:22:54] <Fangs> int-e: that was to my question is c(Av) = c(v)*constant?
[15:23:00] <Fangs> or the original question?
[15:23:08] <int-e> the former
[15:23:28] <Fangs> int-e: I thought about it, its only true if v is an eigenvector of A
[15:23:53] <Fangs> I was playing around with this the whole day
[15:24:25] *** Joins: RadSurfer (~RadSurfer@cpe-174-104-66-243.neo.res.rr.com)
[15:24:56] <Fangs> int-e: wait why does your c produce a vector?
[15:25:13] <int-e> it doesn't; u,v,w are scalars here
[15:25:22] <Fangs> ah right
[15:25:54] <Fangs> int-e: do we think its true btw?
[15:25:57] <int-e> I should've written c(v) = (0,1,2)v instead.
[15:26:10] <int-e> Yeah, the claim is true.
[15:26:17] <Fangs> so let [A,B]v = c(v)*w, [A,B]w = c(w)*w ofc, so w is an eigenvector
[15:26:22] <Fangs> int-e: do you have a proof?
[15:26:40] <int-e> enough of it to satisfy myself :P
[15:26:52] *** Joins: Julian (~tos9@python/site-packages/Julian)
[15:27:25] <Fangs> I have two maps P_w(v) = c(w)v - c(v)w, and ofc D = [A,B]v = c(v)w. you can compute things, P^2 = c(w) P and D^2 = c(w)D
[15:27:29] <Fangs> so these are almost projections
[15:27:36] <Fangs> assuming c(w) =/= 0
[15:27:43] <Fangs> PD = DP = 0 too ofc
[15:28:38] <int-e> It's relatively easy when A is diagonalizable, but Jordan blocks are tricky.
[15:29:18] <Fangs> think I can take Ker(D) (+) Ker(P), in some sense and "by previous exercise, AB = BA in Ker(D) and so they have a common eigenvector there"

[21:41:15] <W> newpy, it took me a second to remember that the US has two senators from each state, to understand your question. Anyway, the answer is no, that's not i
[21:42:21] <W> anyway, you've not specified  how the 70 senators are to be picked (there is no carry over of the "one senator from each state" so it has to be clarified - is it now "at least one senator from each state"?)
[21:43:09] <W> hmm yes probably, because then your answer seems correct at first thought

[21:45:55] <riv> i really think there's a some missing stuff from galois theory texts

[21:46:59] <newpy> I see
[21:47:18] <riv> what is a matrix algebra?
[21:47:19] <Z-module> in each of the 20 both-on-committee states, there is no choice of anything, but in each of the 30 other states, there is a one-out-of-two choice to be made.

[23:09:20] <newpy> ie. if we have p red balls and q black balls, there are (p+q)! sequences of these balls, and we divide by p!q! to remove indistinguishable sequences
[23:09:48] <newpy> oh wait I think I get it
[23:12:09] <trinity> I am uncertain of c
[23:12:57] <trinity> I have formula -C= Phase Shift *B
[23:13:36] <buster> johnkeats6: evening
[23:13:57] <trinity> What is the difference between period and phase shift
[23:14:06] <trinity> Sorry i will google
[23:15:08] <trinity> One says how far it has shifted horizontally for for phase shift another says the period the graph is decreasing so i guess iy is the time it takes to go from 0 to 1
[23:15:12] <trinity> Or one to 0
[23:15:17] <trinity> If its the same

[23:30:16] <trinity> One definition says, Virtical shift is how far the function has shifted vertically from the usual position
[23:30:43] <trinity> So if it hasnt then it makes it sound like it is 0
[23:30:55] <trinity> That is strange

[23:52:25] <trinity> For kind i think c and d are 0
[23:52:40] <trinity> It doest shift up or down or sideways
[23:52:51] <trinity> For mine i think
[23:52:58] <trinity> Seems to work
