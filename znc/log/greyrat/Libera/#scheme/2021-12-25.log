[00:22:32] <sham1> Nice
[00:27:03] <edgar-rft> why then does imgur show me all that garbage around the code?
[00:27:46] <sham1> Hah!
[00:32:32] <amazigh> I got a basic^W scheme repl running with nice colors https://i.imgur.com/SAQTcnP.png

[21:13:41] <elly> why does set-map return a list instead of a set?
[21:13:56] <elly> actually, I guess that is a racket question
[21:15:03] <dpk> i assume because applying map to the items of a set might return the same thing multiple times
[21:15:19] <elly> ooh, that's a very good point
[21:15:22] <elly> I did not think of that
[21:16:23] <dpk> amazigh: Gerbil's C FFI is fine. actually one of the better documented parts of Gerbil, because it's actually just Gambit's FFI wearing a false moustache, and you can read the excellent Gambit documentation
[21:17:16] <dpk> however, Gerbil is generally disappointing, i've found. the more i used it, the more fiddly little bugs and other problems i found as well as a general apathy on vyzo's part towards fixing them. it's not really even clear to me that he's still interested in maintaining it
[21:18:46] <amazigh> then I did not read the good gambit documentation as usual
[21:19:27] <amazigh> for some reason, my define-library forms does not work with racket's chez fork
[21:20:39] <amazigh> but it works with cisco fork
[21:24:20] <amazigh> I do not understand why `name` is capture inside the quasisyntax at http://ix.io/3Jui
[21:25:12] <amazigh> apparantly, inside the quasisyntax #` thingy, name will be bound to the syntax-case clause `name`
[21:25:25] <amazigh> That is totally unexpected.
[21:25:45] <amazigh> I tried #,name but chez dislike it (I do not recall the actual error)

[21:59:51] <amazigh> also, the premise seems wrong headed, how they will create a surface syntax that easier than s-expr for macros?

[23:02:49] <sham1> I mean, C also has them. Sure, they're token substitution, but they exist.
[23:03:34] <sham1> Now, more advanced macro systems outside of the Lisps also deal with s-expressions in a sense, although there it's more understood in terms of the AST
[23:08:21] <drakonis> y'know, the weird thing about rhombus is that it was originally presented as racket 2, but it doesn't seem to bring anything new beyond syntax
[23:09:02] <amazigh> why do you think it will backfire?
[23:09:22] <amazigh> I think the main point is syntax
[23:12:02] <drakonis> because the goal seems to be a departure from the standard syntax without bringing anything new to the table

[23:14:55] <drakonis> it's a huge dog and pony show for very minor gain
[23:15:35] <drakonis> a bet on changing the syntax to find out if it's actually going to attract new users
[23:16:18] <Zipheir> Should've been called Racku...
[23:16:25] <sham1> hah
[23:16:28] <sham1> Or Perl 7
[23:17:56] <drakonis> hah yes.

[23:27:19] <drakonis> shoulda been like raku tho
[23:28:15] <drakonis> actually, this is basically that
[23:28:54] <drakonis> except it took a lot less time to get there

[23:38:28] <drakonis> amazigh: the only mistake is trying to switch away from parens and not adding anything that separates it from the other options
[23:47:04] <amazigh> yep
