[01:05:06] <Hash> oh i see the analogy it's a one way unidirectional flow
[01:05:06] <Apachez> basically a device with fiber in between that only allows data to be physically sent in one directoin
[01:05:15] <Hash> makes sense
[01:05:31] <Apachez> this way you can import like windowsupdates to an isolated network but data can never leak that path the other way

[01:05:49] <Hash> that's pretty cool
[01:05:53] <Hash> learn something new everyday
[01:06:00] <Apachez> more advanced editions have proxies at each end to fool protocols that communicate at both directions but in reality they only speak to the proxy at each end

[01:09:32] <Apachez> the homeedition is to use three mediaconverters...    you connect only A TX -> RX B   thats your diode path   but then you connect A RX to C TX and C RX to B TX  if I recall it correctly

[01:09:42] <dodo> Hash: erm, they don't have much in common

[01:10:03] <Apachez> yet A can only send to B,  B can never return traffic back to A
[01:10:10] <Apachez> again if I recall the schematics
[01:10:18] <Apachez> again this is without assurance
[01:10:19] <Hash> I googled one vs the other to see differnces and learn more
[01:10:36] <Apachez> meaning if the transceivers used have undocumented bidi features you are screwed :P

[01:11:07] <Hash> dvd drives would be slow, flash drives also slow
[01:11:08] <Apachez> I would prefer DVD over USB for such situation since DVD cant (well not normally) be altered once the disc is finalized
[01:11:12] <Hash> you probably want ssd
[01:11:17] <Apachez> this way IF you get some bad code you still have it on dvd drive
[01:11:19] <dodo> yeah, you don't see them too often outside of "very secure" envs
[01:11:25] <Apachez> no antivirus software can alter or remove it
[01:11:35] <Hash> dodo: you ever maked one?
[01:11:42] <Apachez> compared to usb where the AV can remove files or alter them and you have zero traceability over time

[01:11:46] <Hash> I like making things. i also read hackaday a lot
[01:11:48] <Hash> oh ok
[01:12:01] <Apachez> there are however encrypted usb drives like datashur from istorage where you can use one readonly pin
[01:12:02] <dodo> i wish i was, but i broke everything i played with since i was a kid, so..
[01:12:08] <Hash> haha
[01:12:13] <REHBhE02qmJNzm6> What if you don't need many transfers (1 transfer/week)?>
[01:12:23] <REHBhE02qmJNzm6> The DVD drive idea isn't that bad then.
[01:12:30] <Apachez> so the host the drive is connected to cannot alter or deletefiles on the drive (you need to unlock it with the admin (readwrite) pin to do so)
[01:12:39] <Apachez> drawback with dvd is of course labour and time :P
[01:12:45] <Apachez> vs using a datadiode :P
[01:12:54] <Apachez> FEC is also a thing when you are using datadiodes...
[01:13:23] <REHBhE02qmJNzm6> FEC?
[01:13:40] <Apachez> since B cannot communicate back to A for resend the stuff transfered needs both checksums (verify it went ok) but also Forward Error Correction so the data can be errorcorrected for smaller mishaps and reconstructed and then forwarded to destination

[01:16:03] <Hash> Does it only work on IP?
[01:16:05] <Hash> No TCP?
[01:16:26] <Apachez> generally speaking it only works for udp
[01:16:40] <Apachez> as with udp encapsulated ipsec you can transform tcp into udp and then send it
[01:16:41] <Hash> I mean, you can't send anything back, so ... there goes error correction. How do you ensure data gets there as intended
[01:16:50] <Apachez> checksums
[01:17:02] *** Quits: sulex (~sulex@user/sulex) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[01:17:14] <Hash> so you send the checksum to the other side somehow
[01:17:14] <Apachez> not unusual that the amount of checksums and FEC is give or take 20-50% of the bandwidth
[01:17:28] <Apachez> so a 1Gbps links gets about 500-800Mbps throughput
[01:17:44] <Apachez> well since A -> B then A can send checksum to B
[01:17:59] <Apachez> so B when the packet is received can checksum the packet and if all ok then forward it further
[01:18:05] <Hash> So you send data first, then the checksum packet?
[01:18:16] <Hash> hmm
[01:18:17] <Apachez> if not ok then the embedded FEC code will make it possible to reconstruct the original packet
[01:18:23] <Apachez> na it often goes in the same
[01:18:26] <Hash> what is FEC?
[01:18:31] *** Pixi_ is now known as Pixi
[01:19:01] <Apachez> so a 1500 byte packet is sent as 1500 byte but only 750-1200 bytes is the original payload - the rest (300-750 bytes) are checksums and FEC code
[01:19:08] <Apachez> Forward Error Correction
[01:19:20] <Hash> That's what i was figuring.
[01:19:30] <Hash> you have to send the checksum with the packet, otherwise the whole thing makes no sense
[01:19:37] <Apachez> did you hear about ECC ?
[01:19:42] <Apachez> error checking and correction
[01:19:48] <Hash> but corruption of packet is fine

[01:19:52] <Apachez> that can often only fix single bit errors (and detect such)
[01:19:54] <Hash> I'm talking about not ECC, but delivery
[01:19:58] <Hash> ensure the delivery
[01:20:07] <Apachez> FEC is more advanced so it can reconstruct even if multiple parts of the packet is broken
[01:20:09] <Hash> you don't have return reciepts on udp
[01:20:18] <Hash> so that's confusing me
[01:20:29] <Hash> also keep in mind im a software dude now doing networking and security so I'mj learning a lot

[01:24:13] <Apachez> udp is connectionless by design
[01:24:19] <Apachez> you just send the packet without prior handshaking
[01:24:26] <Apachez> that is on protocol level
[01:24:46] <Apachez> you can still apply your own handshaking on application level like snmp who uses udp
[01:25:19] <Apachez> so a datadiode is a device that guarantee that a traffic flow can only occur in one physical direction (like A -> B)
[01:25:41] <Apachez> this is done by using fiberoptics with a TX transceiver on one end and RX transceiver on the other

[01:25:58] <Apachez> so thats the physical path
[01:26:07] <Apachez> to utilize this you use UDP to send data from A to B
[01:26:33] <Apachez> and you add checksums and FEC so if the packet arrives broken at B then B can still reconstruct the original packet before forwarding it further on the B side
[01:27:39] <Apachez> and for advance setups you setup TCP proxys at each end like so   clients A <-> proxyA -> datadiode A side -> datadiode B side -> proxy B <-> clients B
[01:27:49] <REHBhE02qmJNzm6> How does one get information onto an airgapped PC?
[01:27:54] <Apachez> proxy will take TCP and transform it into UDP and append checksums and FEC
[01:28:12] <Apachez> proxy will also fool the clients (hosts) at each side to think they speak to each other while they really arent
[01:28:20] <Apachez> for example to mimic windowsupdate services
[01:28:21] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[01:28:26] <REHBhE02qmJNzm6> Is the only way by using printed paper and an OCR system?
[01:29:00] <Apachez> you can use your hand, you can scan things into airgapped systems (if scanner is available), you can add datamedia to it like usb/dvd/floppy
[01:29:30] <Apachez> note however that only cd/dvd is prefered since usb drive can carry data back over the airgap and by that leak information (even if its slow and high latency ;)

[03:26:17] <jessicara> kinda-true
[03:26:34] <jessicara> imei is a cellular thing, but mac is sometimes unchangable on wifi devices and is unique (usually)
[03:26:39] <jessicara> oh TimMc beat me to it
[03:27:02] <jessicara> sometimes can just outright spoof it though
[03:27:23] <TimMc> MAC can be spoofed, but it's really only exposed to the local network.

[03:28:11] <TimMc> Someone on the network could then tell someone off the network, but they'd have to do it on purpose.
[03:31:24] <Joanna> Actually maybe I got it backwards.. maybe it was exact location for someone using the WiFi
[03:32:12] <jessicara> well, phased grid arrays are pretty interesting

[03:49:48] <TimMc> So maybe you find out that someone can see networks with Super Common Names 5, 12, 83, and 142, and then you've narrowed down their location to a handful of spots.
[03:51:02] <jessicara> this really depends on who or what are hiding from i guess too
[03:51:21] <jessicara> if you have to worry about phased grid arrays and supercomputer brute force power - yeah no
[03:51:38] <KryptoK> I think Google uses the BSSID and GPS.

[03:55:06] <KryptoK> Then when you use your webbrowser on a site with one of their trackers they can portentially know exactly where you are by fingerprinting your computer and browser
[03:56:37] <Joanna> Would google be thwarted if everyone changed their router names more often than their cars can map them ?
[03:56:39] <KryptoK> They will use any bit of data they can get down to differentiate your system from somebody elses all the way down to the screen resolution
[03:57:18] <KryptoK> if they are using bssid it will not matter what your networks name is
[03:57:49] <KryptoK> they would know the router hardware no matter what name you put on it.
[03:58:22] <KryptoK> as far as fingerprinting your system it may help some.
[03:58:43] <TimMc> So, the "share my location with this website" feature doesn't *quite* allow for that.
[03:58:56] <KryptoK> it depends on what wifi properties they can scrape off your system.
[03:59:16] <jessicara> surprisingly a lot if don't block outgoing connections or javascript it seems
[03:59:29] <TimMc> The way that works is that your browser sends wifi SSIDs and BSSIDs, IP, maybe other things to a "location service provider", gets back a lat/long, and then sends that to the website.
[03:59:46] <TimMc> If Google is your location service provider, then Google gets all those details.
[04:00:26] <TimMc> I don't know what precision your browser allows sending to websites, but theoretically you could reduce that precision.
[04:00:34] <KryptoK> Any site with a Google Analytics tracker on it is contributing to this invasion of privacy
[04:00:52] <KryptoK> and if you are signed into gmail you are making it so much easier.
[04:01:13] <jessicara> i'm kinda interested in how youtube seems to have consumed majority of video sharing, and behaviour even when not logged in seems tracked
[04:01:43] <jessicara> like even if i tunnel something and fake all sorts of stuff, from the few watch it tends to figure out which bucket to put me in
[04:01:48] <KryptoK> every site you go to with a google tracker is going to know your identity without browser or system fingerprinting
[04:01:57] <Joanna> So the routers themselves are tools for spying. Iâ€™ve heard stories of router that were transmitting with large antennas that had nothing to do with wifi.

[04:12:34] <[iz]> seperate IP on the same network segment is still terrible
[04:12:35] <TimMc> although I almost wish it weren't :-)
[04:12:38] <jessicara> means everything has strict firewalls
[04:12:47] <[iz]> most of those all-in-one wifi routers do it that way, all on one segment
[04:12:59] <jessicara> also looking at their provided router, it logs a lot of things
[04:13:06] <TimMc> If they gave you and "guests" the same IP, your traffic would be more deniable.
[04:13:10] <[iz]> so if you can connect w/ wifi, you can arppoision to redirect all the wired traffic out over wifi also
[04:13:19] <jessicara> and their 'tech support' seems to leak data to scammers
[04:13:44] <[iz]> ppl expect thier wired connections to be safe from wifi attacks, but often they aren't

[04:13:58] <jessicara> or from the isp itself
[04:14:09] <KryptoK> Even tunnels have their weakness.  You can still tell somebody is useing one and ip address of the vpn provider.  If the vpn provider is willing to give up their logs they still know what you are doing

[04:21:44] <jessicara> this is just at the ethernet, i leave the wifi as unused as can
[04:21:56] <ilikeyou> sometimes they use host isolation in place of network segmentation. which is still not great
[04:22:00] <jessicara> yes, wifi ranges have been poking the ethernet side despite 'isolation'

[04:24:41] <KryptoK> Degoogled phones are good.  They take all the Google crap off them and give you the base android os.  There are some convienence issues with them but there is a guy with the last name Braxton that sells degoogled phones and has a youtube channel.
[04:25:22] <jessicara> yeah those are a good idea
[04:26:45] <jessicara> i guess it might seem overly paranoid what i do
[04:27:06] <Joanna> But all cell phones give your location donâ€™t they or can you actually turn off the degoogled phones and not be tracked ?
[04:27:19] <jessicara> more about limiting the ease of tracking
[04:27:28] <jessicara> any signal can be followed
[04:27:31] <jessicara> but it's work
[04:27:50] <jessicara> it's not work to just let google collect it all for others
[04:27:54] <jessicara> then search it
[04:28:11] <KryptoK> with out google services a phone is much more controlable.  Some phones even have a physical switch to turn off gps
[04:28:30] <KryptoK> Linux phones are another idea.  There are draw backs there too.
[04:28:40] <plankers> without google or gps youd have to do cell tower triangulation, which can be laborious
[04:28:59] <plankers> but that can always be fallen back on for any phone that uses cell towers

[04:39:59] <ajak> do you think you have anything to worry about?
[04:40:09] <KryptoK> not off the top of my head
[04:41:17] <KryptoK> would be more interested in the data on the drive.
[04:41:23] <Vol[m]> ajak: Not really just found it weird and only noticed because i got a pop up cuz secure boot was enabled
[04:41:31] <Joanna> KryptoK: I donâ€™t think people are going to be dumping smart phones. Everytime I go outside I see zombies staring at phones
[04:41:43] <KryptoK> is it encrypted?
[04:42:27] <Vol[m]> KryptoK: It was encrypted so nothing to worry about there :P
[04:42:36] <[iz]> Vol[m]: probably nothing to worry about, likely happened by accident
[04:42:51] <ajak> are your boot files unencrypted?
[04:43:01] <ajak> kernels/bootloaders
[04:43:06] <KryptoK> joanna: there are some that have.  I'm not one of them but there is alot of frustration with Google especially.
[04:43:18] <[iz]> there is a reset CMOS button that maybe got pushed and held during cleaning or maybe static discharge even

[04:45:45] <ajak> only the home folder is encrypted or unencrypted?
[04:45:47] <KryptoK> ajak: if you have windows machine if it is using bitlocker and they did not have the password I think you are ok

[04:46:20] <Vol[m]> ajak: Fixed it
[04:46:20] <ajak> you don't have any way of knowing if they messed with your root files, then
[04:46:26] <KryptoK> That is more than likely where the data is.

[04:46:59] <KryptoK> I would not sweat it.  I don't know what they would think they could do by messing with the bios
[04:47:01] <ajak> because an evil maid can then replace, say, /sbin/cryptsetup and steal the encryption password
[04:47:34] <ajak> but also they have your root files anyway so they have access to whatever's there
[04:47:51] <Vol[m]> Guess ill just have to trust they were good people lol
[04:47:56] <KryptoK> if you had a bios password that would obviously let them in to the os at that point.  They could have just taken the drive out of the machine at that point and left the bios password in tact
[04:47:58] <ajak> yes :)
[04:48:08] <[iz]> if you didn't previously have a password protecting bios changes, there's really no malicious reason to reset it
[04:48:34] <ajak> and with root unencrypted nothing's really being protected anyway
[04:48:36] <[iz]> so most likely just accidental
[04:49:10] <ajak> would happen with bios upgrades, too

[05:00:00] <KryptoK> Assertions that ME is a backdoor
[05:00:02] <KryptoK> Critics like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Libreboot developers, and security expert Damien Zammit accused the ME of being a backdoor and a privacy concern.[77][4][78] Zammit stresses that the ME has full access to memory (without the owner-controlled CPU cores having any knowledge), and has full access to the TCP/IP stack and can send and receive network packets independently of the operating system, thus bypassing its
[05:00:03] <KryptoK> firewall.[6]
[05:00:05] <KryptoK> Intel responded by saying that "Intel does not put back doors in its products nor do our products give Intel control or access to computing systems without the explicit permission of the end user."[6] and "Intel does not and will not design backdoors for access into its products. Recent reports claiming otherwise are misinformed and blatantly false. Intel does not participate in any efforts to decrease security of its technology."[
[05:00:06] <KryptoK> 79]
[05:00:08] <KryptoK> In the context of criticism of the Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology it has been pointed out that the National Security Agency (NSA) budget request for 2013 contained a Sigint Enabling Project with the goal to "Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, â€¦" and it has been conjectured that Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology might be part of that program.[80][81]

[21:12:02] <secbot> ^ These are some of the notable Single Sign-On implementations available:
[21:12:25] <HCB> SSO has long been used in the enterprise to reduce (and better manage) the number of credentials an employee requires to access enterprise applications
[21:12:45] <HCB> so it's just for corporate env?
[21:12:47] <TimMc> It's a way of delegating authentication.
[21:13:00] <TimMc> Mostly corporate.
[21:13:00] <HCB> Are there providres for free for public?
[21:13:09] <HCB> Or how does it work for normal people in the world
[21:13:12] <HCB> who dont' do corporate stuff
[21:13:26] <TimMc> I guess any time you do "log in with Google" that's SSO as well, of a sort.
[21:13:29] <HCB> You login to google once, and you shouldn't have to login to anything else.
[21:13:33] <HCB> Thanks!
[21:13:37] <HCB> Ok, that settles the confusion
[21:14:04] <TimMc> It might be via SAML or OAuth or something else.
[21:14:09] <HCB> Right
[21:14:14] <HCB> Open ID is another I think
[21:14:51] <TimMc> yeah
[21:14:58] <TimMc> Open ID is mostly dead at this point.

[21:15:56] <HCB> There used to be. I think google once did? I know I had it at once point and then it stopped working

[23:57:47] <Hash> Use their tone generator, record tones on a casette recorder, but by then, most pay phones were protected.
[23:58:04] <Hash> You had to drop in a first con, before the mic opened up to listen to tones
[23:58:12] <Hash> Drop in  nikcle, play back tones, and get free calls
[23:58:30] <Hash> Those were the days.
[23:58:52] <Hydragyrum> I know a guy who'd whistle the tones, it was pretty neat
[23:59:13] <Hash> I made a blackbox at home once. You know when the phone is on cradle, it's like 12 or 40v. When you pick up, it switches to 12 or 40, forgot which one. That's how the exchange knows you picked up and that's how they billed the called

[23:59:28] <Hash> If you modify your phoned so itnever switched voltage when you picked up, the caller wouldn't get billed
