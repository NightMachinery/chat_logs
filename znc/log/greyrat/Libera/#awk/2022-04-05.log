[19:41:58] <aead> How can I expect POSIX awk to handle UTF-8 content? Any footguns, or should it be more or less agnostic as long as I'm not relying on, eg, classes like :alpha:? 
[19:43:22] *** Quits: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog) (Quit: = "")
[19:44:00] <Earnestly> aead: It should have no problem, POSIX full supports such things based on locale
[19:44:25] <Earnestly> But whether your implementation supports multibyte locales properly is another concern, e.g. most GNU tools don't support multibyte characters
[19:44:31] <Earnestly> Such as fold(1)
[19:44:50] <Earnestly> aead: :alpha: comes from POSIX even
[19:45:53] <aead> I'm aiming that my tool should work almost everywhere. I'm usually matching against "it's a control character or these handful of escape sequences". Is that likely to cause issues? 
[19:51:02] *** Quits: xmb (~xmb@65.108.1.186) (Quit: BitchX: the un-Cola)
[19:51:06] <Earnestly> That's not a question that can be answered
[19:52:27] <aead> I guess I'm asking if valid printable characters in common encodings would be misinterpreted as being in the the POSIX character class cntrl, but this is easy enough for me to verify later on, so I'm satisfied 
[19:52:29] <Earnestly> You will have to learn how to answer that for your situation and specifics, it seems like you're not aware of the posix manuals
[19:55:34] <Earnestly> :cntrl: depends on the locale (see iscntrl(3p))
[19:57:35] <Earnestly> See https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap07.html#tag_07 for more

[20:00:41] <Earnestly> Fwiw, the POSIX locale won't handle UTF-8 above the ASCII subset it encodes (it's the same as the C locale, essentially)
[20:01:01] <Earnestly> But you shouldn't really be caring about the locale unless you need to work with bytes specifically
