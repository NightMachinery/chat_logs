[05:40:55] <SpaceVimBot_> <wintermute2021> @wsdjeg Yes, it works well with a more recent version.
[11:03:33] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Which plugin manager do you use guys?
[11:04:07] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I have installed https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp but it seems not working
[11:07:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> The auto completion that space vim is always using by default is the one that still shows up, or am i required to delete it in order for my plugin to work?
[11:13:14] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Available plugins in SpaceVim
[11:13:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> All plugins can be easily discovered via <Leader> f p.
[11:13:16] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Does anyone knows what that Leader does? I want to disable a spacevim plugin that does autocompletion
[11:18:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> '\' symbol by default (re @Macurrent: Available plugins in SpaceVim
[11:18:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> All plugins can be easily discovered via <Leader> f p.
[11:18:31] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Does anyone knows what that Leader does? I want to disable a spacevim plugin that does autocompletion)
[11:19:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I just type / f p but nothing happened (re @semayog: '\' symbol by default)
[11:20:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Or do you know the plugin name that does autocompletion in spacevim?
[11:21:06] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> it works well : http://img.vim-china.org/download/2ed41ec6/file_7438.jpg
[11:22:08] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I won't even know what is the plugin that i want to disable from there lol. I don't know the name of that plugin (re @semayog: )
[11:22:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I won't even know what is the plugin that i want to disable from there lol. I don't know the name of that plugin but i know what it does (edited) (re @semayog: )
[11:22:40] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I wanted to use this plugin (re @Macurrent: I have installed https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp but it seems not working)
[11:22:53] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> ðŸ™ˆcho g:spacevim_autocomplete_method
[11:23:02] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> :echo g:spacevim_autocomplete_method (edited)
[11:23:07] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I wanted to use this plugin and remove the one that spacevim is using (edited) (re @Macurrent: I have installed https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp but it seems not working)
[11:23:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> :h g:spacevim_autocomplete_method
[11:24:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> What do you think about this autocomplete method? (re @Macurrent: I have installed https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp but it seems not working)
[11:26:49] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> I haven't tried it. (re @Macurrent: What do you think about this autocomplete method?)
[11:27:16] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I have disabled deoplete but it still works though (re @semayog: I haven't tried it.)
[11:27:23] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> what's happening
[11:28:01] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> how did you do that? (re @Macurrent: I have disabled deoplete but it still works though)
[11:28:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> http://img.vim-china.org/download/7b74ce63/file_7439.jpg
[11:29:09] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Just added that last option there (re @Macurrent: )
[11:29:18] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Have you tried to remove autocomplete layer at all?
[11:30:10] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> and where is your custom plugin for nvim-cmp? (re @Macurrent: )
[11:30:53] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> drop full init.oml file here (re @Macurrent: )
[11:31:58] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> http://img.vim-china.org/download/a9a67307/config
[11:35:12] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Yes, the deoplete still works even after i did that (re @semayog: Have you tried to remove autocomplete layer at all?)
[11:35:37] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> deoplete is not running ))) : http://img.vim-china.org/download/767ed7b6/file_7441.jpg
[11:36:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> what editor? Vim or NeoVim ? (re @Macurrent: Yes, the deoplete still works even after i did that)
[11:36:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Neovim
[11:36:37] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> what version?
[11:37:03] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> 0.6.1
[11:37:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> v0.6.1 (edited)
[11:37:39] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Is my config okey? (re @Macurrent: )
[11:37:48] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> How did you do it? (re @semayog: )
[11:41:14] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> run 
[11:41:14] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> :UpdateRemotePlugins (re @Macurrent: How did you do it?)
[11:43:57] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Thanks, It's now gone (re @semayog: run 
[11:43:58] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> :UpdateRemotePlugins)
[11:44:19] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> But the plugin i installed is not working still
[11:44:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> This plugin (re @Macurrent: I have installed https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp but it seems not working)
[11:58:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Did the plugin i sent you work for you? (re @semayog: run 
[11:58:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> :UpdateRemotePlugins)
[11:59:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> I have deoplete )) (re @Macurrent: Did the plugin i sent you work for you?)
[12:00:10] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Why is it that after i disable it the newly plugin that i installed does not work? (re @semayog: I have deoplete )))
[12:00:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Why is it that after i disable deoplete it the newly plugin that i installed does not work? (edited) (re @semayog: I have deoplete )))
[12:01:56] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> is it loaded? (re @Macurrent: Why is it that after i disable deoplete it the newly plugin that i installed does not work?)
[12:02:08] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I think so, (re @semayog: is it loaded?)
[12:02:26] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> it showed me it's installed, How do i know it's loaded?
[12:03:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
[12:03:18] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Here it is, it's nicer than deoplete (re @semayog: is it loaded?)
[12:04:37] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> did you have that message? : http://img.vim-china.org/download/f1abee88/file_7442.jpg
[12:04:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Yes (re @semayog: )
[12:07:37] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> It works well )) : http://img.vim-china.org/download/72dc028f/file_7443.jpg
[12:08:10] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Did you still disable deoplete? (re @semayog: )
[12:08:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> yes
[12:08:46] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Maybe is should send you my config file you check, i don't know what's wrong with mine (re @semayog: yes)
[12:11:04] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> http://img.vim-china.org/download/ae2d123c/config
[12:20:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Now spacevim is failing to disable deoplete on my system
[12:20:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> I don't know is it OK to use full repo URL like this "https://gitlab.com/code-stats/code-stats-vim.git"
[12:20:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Try to use short repo name "code-stats/code-stats-vim"
[12:21:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> and where is [[custom_plugins]] for this??? (re @Macurrent: https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
[12:21:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Here it is, it's nicer than deoplete)
[12:22:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I think it's there (re @semayog: and where is [[custom_plugins]] for this???)
[12:23:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> [[custom_plugins]]
[12:23:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog>     repo = "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp"
[12:23:23] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog>     merged = false
[12:23:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Isn't it this? : http://img.vim-china.org/download/a97c71b6/file_7445.jpg
[12:24:05] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> this is complete different link ))) (re @Macurrent: https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
[12:24:06] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Here it is, it's nicer than deoplete)
[12:24:49] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> what plugin are you talking about now? )))
[12:25:19] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> code-stat or nvim-cmp ? )))
[12:27:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I did the way you are saying, deoplete refuses to disable itself (re @semayog: code-stat or nvim-cmp ? ))))
[12:28:05] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> http://img.vim-china.org/download/a287b500/config
[12:28:16] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> My new config (re @semayog: code-stat or nvim-cmp ? ))))
[12:29:58] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> This is what i see when i run updateremoteplugin : http://img.vim-china.org/download/3a3b2f18/file_7447.jpg
[12:33:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Why is deoplete now refusing to get removed from spacevim? (re @Macurrent: )
[12:35:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> I can't to explain
[12:35:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> try to ask @wsdjeg
[12:43:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Does yours also show like this in health? : http://img.vim-china.org/download/4ac4195f/file_7448.jpg
[12:47:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Yep (re @Macurrent: )
[12:51:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> Did you install anything additional? (re @semayog: Yep)
[12:52:26] <SpaceVimBot_> <Macurrent> I don't understand why it's not working on my machine
