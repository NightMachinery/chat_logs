[00:49:11] <jneira[m]> well ci is going quite well lately, gh gave us a bunch of parallel runners
[00:49:46] <jneira[m]> but yeah maybe drafts prs could be cut 
[00:50:24] <jneira[m]> (previous commits builds are cancelled automatic when you do a new one)
[00:52:11] <jneira[m]> anton-latukha: cant help much about the ghc internals thing, i did not investigate much and my memory forget quickly the little knowledge i eventually got
[00:53:47] <anton-latukha[m]> jneira[m]: Interesting - whould know that it now possible.
[00:56:09] <anton-latukha[m]> jneira[m]: I think I would sort it out.
[00:56:09] <anton-latukha[m]> Tomorrow I would rest, but on the week would try to make it into MVP stage.
[00:59:11] <anton-latukha[m]> <jneira[m]> "well ci is going quite well..." <- Then I think it is non-issue really.
[00:59:11] <anton-latukha[m]> Circle CI builds also do not discern draft status.
[00:59:11] <anton-latukha[m]> & looking at CI - I thought that some special arrangement there, but can't thought of how to ask that 8).
[01:01:52] <anton-latukha[m]> It is as with Kmett code stream on Twitch. Seems like there some special arrangement. Twitch regularly does not store that amount of videostreams for 3 years.
[01:04:05] <anton-latukha[m]> But they should be watched carefully, as for example - I become strongly agitated:
[01:04:05] <anton-latukha[m]> https://www.twitch.tv/ekmett/videos?filter=highlights&sort=time
[01:04:50] <anton-latukha[m]> s/carefully/by a small dosage/, s/strongly/too/
[01:07:23] <anton-latukha[m]> So that CI thing is trivial non-priority - it is more important to save human effort now.

[13:31:35] <anton-latukha[m]> Even while I never had to deal with byte literals recently. In the childhood probably spent in the HEX editor too much time, or it is because of it - makes me so happy to see how they convert....
