[04:18:05] <Tirifto> tbrowder: I‚Äôm working on a small (text-based) game for a jam; Door is an Entity (basic game object) supposed to link Rooms together. For design reasons, I don‚Äôt actually put Door objects into Rooms, but I make Doorside objects, each of which is supposed to refer to a Door and delegate its messages to it. But the ‚Äòname‚Äô method didn‚Äôt work as intended when called on Doorside. I thought maybe I misunderstood how d
[04:18:05] <Tirifto> elegation worked, so I tried to override it with a custom method that just called ‚Äòname‚Äô on the Door object explicitly. That‚Äôs when I got the error.

[04:22:50] <Tirifto> Oh wait.
[04:24:04] <Tirifto> Ohh, when Raku says ‚ÄòDoor type object‚Äô it literally means the object representing the Door type. I wrongly thought it meant any object whose type was Door. That gives me a clue as to what might be wrong. Sorry for the confusion. >_<
[04:24:45] <Tirifto> (The gist I printed actually tipped me off; thanks!)
[04:26:20] <Juerd> Tirifto: It may help to know that a typed variable starts out containing the type object
[04:27:09] <Juerd> Tirifto: So simply having "class Door { has $.foo }; my Door $d; $d.foo;" will get you that error
[04:27:28] <Juerd> That's because $d is not defined, and thus contains the type object
[04:29:29] <Tirifto> Juerd: I sort of knew about it but hadn‚Äôt realised the implication in this situation. Thank you for pointing that out. >_<
[04:29:55] <Juerd> The error message may be slightly LTA because it could mention that the value is not defined to help out people unfamiliar with this pattern.

[04:47:48] <Tirifto> berber44, this is just a wild guess, but perhaps it refers to Rakudo‚Äôs internal performance tests? Raku programs often have tests in the ‚Äòt‚Äô directory, and the only mention of ‚Äòtest-t benchmark‚Äô I found was in an article discussing performance improvements in Rakudo.
[04:51:24] <Tirifto> Yet another question: When method calls are delegated to another object, they work with the delegatee‚Äôs attributes and not with the original object‚Äôs attributes, right?

[05:02:27] <berber44> Tirifito, I was asking regarding this line in the recent Rakudo weekly: "The really good news is that the well-known test-t benchmark..." And it seems that no one knows anything about this "well-known" benchmark. :-((((("

[23:26:04] <moon-child> right, that works with assoc<list>, but roast tests doing it with an assoc<right>!
[23:26:24] <raydiak> heh...idk about that one :)

[23:28:16] <raydiak> with a named it lets it take an adverb, but 3 positionals? no idea

[23:30:21] <moon-child> ^ what roast tests
[23:32:10] <raydiak> which test is it in? maybe there's something in the syns about it

[23:32:44] <raydiak> I mean which file
[23:33:04] <moon-child> S32-list/rduce.t
[23:40:54] <raydiak> not sure why you'd define something as an operator if it only works for reduction. interesting though, I guess
[23:44:15] <raydiak> git blame points to TimToady
[23:47:32] <tonyo_> why would that be an infix anyway?
[23:51:24] <raydiak> that's why it's confusing, you can never directly use it as an infix operator
