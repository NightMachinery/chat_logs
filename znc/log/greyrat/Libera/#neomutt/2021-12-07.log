[13:01:33] <holgersson> morning!
[13:02:18] <holgersson> Starting with 20211029 I have random crashes on mailbox switching. Is this already a known issue? If not I'll start debugging later this week, when I - hopefully - find some time :)
[13:06:40] <gahr> doesn't ring a bell
[13:06:46] <gahr> do you have a backtrace?
[13:10:30] *** Joins: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico)
[13:11:07] <gahr> holgersson: aren't you hitting #3126 perhaps?

[13:18:48] *** Joins: Pali (~pali@user/pali)
[13:19:58] <holgersson> gahr: thanks, and I've no backtrace so far, only segfaults.
[13:19:58] <holgersson> gahr: That bug should hit directly on startup, right?
[13:26:18] <gahr> yep
[13:26:59] <gahr> are you able to try building master?
[13:27:09] <gahr> it might have been solved already
[13:32:06] <kushal> gahr, holgersson Good morning 
[13:34:22] <holgersson> kushal: morning
[13:34:57] <holgersson> gahr: OK, then it's something different, yes, I'm already on master since that release and now, so far it isn't

[13:36:13] <holgersson> gahr: But I'm on gentoo with a hardened toolchain and gcc-11 and CFLAGS="-march=native", so it could be entirely my own problem :) As mentioned I'll finally start to debug when I find some time this week.
