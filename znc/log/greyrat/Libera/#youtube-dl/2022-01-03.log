[18:33:26] <ede> oh. does this maybe include proprietary tags?
[18:33:46] <ede> or maybe does this all happen with JS in the browser. hm.

[18:35:23] <qjsgkem> I have no idea, that wasn't among my problem set:) last month I scraped some silly cartoon because the alt text was in the page, but not searchable, be it by on site search function or google, it was the first time ever I used py-bs
[18:36:22] <qjsgkem> success. I found https://www.gocomics.com/darksideofthehorse/2015/05/28 again:)
[18:38:09] <ede> heh been on a weird site of a really weird guy last week. had been there like a decade ago already. one of these monstrosities. firefox failed and i opened it in links2 then (with -g, so images!)

[18:43:49] <ede> somehow i don't feel good using pythong from bash scripts, i'd really prefer to use it as a lib from python
[18:44:55] <ede> i actually like sites written in pure JS, but then please do it. sometimes it makes sense since it's dynamic all the time anyway.
[18:45:21] <ede> only the solution can't be to import half a dozen frameworks
[18:47:39] <ede> like https://isfreenodedeadyet.com/ is just a script in the header and an iframe with a handful elements and... scripting.
