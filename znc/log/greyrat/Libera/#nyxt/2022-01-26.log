[19:24:21] <lagash> I take it 3972ece164d55cf835934fdae6697b68329dc6b9 incidentally fixes that Gemini Unicode bug?
[19:25:01] <lagash> jmercouris: been eating fermented fruits lately? :P
[19:36:40] <aartaka> lagash: It does, unless the website uses non-UTF-8 encoding :)
[19:41:21] <lagash> aartaka: I'm trying to remember what Gemsites I was testing it with..
[19:41:45] <lagash> Although gopher://baud.baby still crashes every time..
[19:42:26] <qhong> pjb: huh, sounds like http://metamodular.com/lispos.pdf
[19:42:39] <aartaka> lagash: gemini://station.martinrue.com/, as per IRC logs.
[19:44:16] <lagash> Cool, it appears to work :)
[19:45:18] <lagash> OK, I see in the crash log this entry: "unhandled condition in --disable-debugger mode, quitting" - how do I enable this debugger?
[19:46:54] <aartaka> lagash: You can connect with SLY/SLIME and set `nyxt::*run-from-repl-p*` to t.
[19:48:02] <aartaka> lagash: does gopher://baud.baby/ even exist? I can't get it to load, let alone throw errors.
[19:51:47] <lagash> Maybe that's the bug? :P
[19:51:54] <lagash> I know it worked two weeks ago.
[19:54:56] <lagash> Yes, it works on Elpher.
[19:56:01] <jmercouris> lagash: lol no, I almost never drink
[19:56:13] <jmercouris> I just thought it was hilarious that waleee was still online
[19:56:22] <jmercouris> So I figured I would nudge him to bed
[19:56:34] <jmercouris> Crazy Swede …
[19:57:20] <jmercouris> qhong: and yes, I’ve also been dreaming of a language that is a superset of CL
[19:57:35] <jmercouris> I’ve mentioned it perhaps just once on the common lisp channel
[19:58:47] <lagash> gopher://45.32.178.12/1/textfiles also doesn't work, although for different reasons..
[19:58:57] <aartaka> lagash: I can't get it to load on elpher 0_o
[20:02:48] <lagash> aartaka: baud.baby ?! sure there's those ANSI color sequences but that's easily solvable with a few lines of Elisp..
[20:03:16] <lagash> Also how do I get the line number this backtrace is throwing?
[20:03:28] * lagash really needs to learn how to debug CL properly.
[20:04:44] <qhong> jmercouris: I'd like a smaller language with super set of power
[20:05:29] <aartaka> qhong: Guile Scheme then? :D
[20:05:30] <jmercouris> qhong: there is no reason to get rid of built in symbols, their implementation already exists
[20:05:43] <jmercouris> S/symbols/functions
[20:05:58] <jmercouris> We would probably use the SBCL compiler or something still
[20:07:25] <qhong> aartaka: still not the level of power that I would stop complaining. And I like MIT Scheme better, it has proper first class environment :D
[20:07:42] <qhong> jmercouris: Full CL may be bootstrapped from the "small ideal language"
[20:08:25] <qhong> jmercouris: Although if we "port" SBCL compiler this way, the compiler will only be useful for CL code, not native "small ideal language" code...
[20:08:50] <aartaka> qhong: Indeed, environments are missing in both CL and Guile.
[20:09:29] <jmercouris> There is nothing to say we can’t take concepts from SICL to have first class environments
[20:09:45] <qhong> it's FCGE, not FCE
[20:09:56] <jmercouris> Additionally, it’s not clear to me that SBCL would produce unoptimized code… I believe it would do just fine
[20:10:13] <jmercouris> Yes sure, first class global environments
[20:10:13] <qhong> FCE is much more powerful than FCGE, especially if combined with F-expr
[20:10:37] <jmercouris> I cannot speak to fexpr
[20:10:48] <jmercouris> I’ve not utilized them in practice
[20:10:50] <qhong> I think it can obliterate all of macros, modules/packages, and object systems
[20:11:32] <jmercouris> qhong: I’ve been trying to pronounce your first name for weeks
[20:11:36] <jmercouris> Can you give me a hint?
[20:15:13] <qhong> jmercouris: it's Mandarin Pinyin, formally it should be /t͡ɕʰjɛn tʰan/, a romanization would be [chi-en tan]
[20:15:37] <jmercouris> Ok I’ll try that
[20:15:52] <jmercouris> So Ch as in “change”?
[20:16:07] <jmercouris> Or Ch as in “chicago”?
[20:16:34] <jmercouris> Thanks for the explanation mr hong :-)
[20:16:40] <jmercouris> I hope to get it correct!
[20:16:45] <qhong> yes actually now you mention that the full first syllable is basically just "chan" in change
