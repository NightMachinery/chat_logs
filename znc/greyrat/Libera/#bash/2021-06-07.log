[19:35:03] <nattiestnate> hi, back with one more noob question: if i have, in a script, a bash function that returns a non-zero value, let's say somefunction() { return 1 }. and somewhere in the script is this line: somefunction && echo "something". why is the echo part executed? i've also noticed that the same happens even if that function returns 0
