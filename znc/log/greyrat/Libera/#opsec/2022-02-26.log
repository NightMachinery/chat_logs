[01:47:15] <Joanna> Interesting video about interior space. Apart from wasting a lot of energy to build and operate that kind of stuff it’s great for pedestrians to walk around in because there aren’t any cars there. I’d much rather have an outdoor city without cars than an underground replica of a city though. Montreal has an underground city with skylights which is pretty good
[01:52:27] <jan6> well as pointed out, it's easy to totally miss the time (quite similar to casinos, really), since there's no global day-night cycle in there
[01:52:35] <jan6> and no windows to the outside either

[15:43:40] <Joanna> It depends on the design of the indoor city if it’s an atrium or has skylights or even outdoor walkway parts you won’t lose track of time. The underground ones you definitely could lose track of time except for if you stay late businesses will close and then you will know it’s late. Those guys should just build a proper hovercraft and be done with it. Hovercrafts float above ground without friction
