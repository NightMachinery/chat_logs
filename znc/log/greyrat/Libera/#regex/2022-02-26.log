[00:38:50] <innovator> hi
[00:38:53] <innovator> https://regex101.com/r/fDaY5O/1
[00:39:00] <innovator> Is it possible to add the second group to divide the sentence by paragraph?
[00:39:13] *** Quits: MThreeR (~M3r@user/M3r) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:39:45] <innovator> the first group is the string ID and the second group is the content
[00:40:25] <OnlineCop> I don't understand.
[00:41:51] <OnlineCop> I usually match strings like this: https://regex101.com/r/fDaY5O/2
[00:42:34] *** Joins: M3r (~M3r@user/M3r)
[00:43:05] <OnlineCop> Match the double quote, then start a group that looks for [^\\"] (a literal '\' character or a literal '"' character) or, if a literal '\' is found, match that plus the character after it (\n, \t, \\, \", and so on ).
[00:44:15] <OnlineCop> Are you defining a paragraph (within the second string) as where '{Text NewLine}' is found? After each '.' in a sentence?
[00:44:51] <innovator> '{Text NewLine}' is tag
[00:45:10] <innovator> after '.' or '!' '?'
[00:45:12] <OnlineCop> Version /2 drops it down from 4244 steps to 138, which matches the same stuff.
[00:46:09] <OnlineCop> While the answer here is "yes you can, in some cases", it depends on the language (PCRE) and engine you're doing it in. And it might just be simpler to get group 2 and .split() it outside of this regex.
[00:46:51] <innovator> I need to create a TMX file
[00:47:21] <innovator> the first group can be avoided
[00:47:28] <OnlineCop> The problem is that your pattern only has 2 capture groups. Therefore, you will ONLY get 2 groups out at the end. If you match up until you reach '.' or '!' or '?' and stop your current match, then your next match would kick off from that character and be in a separate match.
[00:48:19] <innovator> I need only the second group. Dividing by sentences
[00:50:16] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/fDaY5O/3 is one way to do it with PCRE.
[00:50:46] <OnlineCop> Actually, the punctuation should probably go in with the rest of the captured text.
[00:54:04] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/fDaY5O/4
[00:56:12] <OnlineCop> innovator: You'll notice here that it matches the first portion with your ID and the '=' between the strings. This is useful so you don't pick up the wrong strings somewhere in the middle.
[00:58:13] <OnlineCop> The (?<content1>) and (?<content2>) groups are actually identical: you could get rid of content1 (right after the first portion matches that starting double quote), so group 1 will always contain just the ID, and only group 2 contains individual sentences.
[01:01:10] <OnlineCop> That might look like https://regex101.com/r/fDaY5O/6
[01:05:00] *** Quits: M3r (~M3r@user/M3r) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:14:20] <innovator> thank you for your help.
[01:14:28] <innovator> But it's giving errors in sentences with escape \"
[01:16:29] <OnlineCop> Use Code Generator.
[01:16:37] <OnlineCop> It's likely that the  \  character needs to be escaped as  \\
[01:16:59] <OnlineCop> And Code Generator will give you "double-quoted strings" with each of the \ characters escaped properly for you.

[05:19:00] <re101-wolf-46> maybe im doing something bad not the regex D:
[05:19:05] <digitok> correct :p
[05:23:30] <digitok> 07re101-wolf-46, not sure if there is a better way, but you can try something like: parseFloat("1.23".replace(",","."))+parseFloat("2,34".replace(",","."))
[05:24:03] <digitok> so, parseFloat(yourNumber.replace(",","."))
[05:24:30] <digitok> since js needs it as a number rather than a string to perform math operations
[05:24:50] <digitok> and also needs a . instead of , for the decimal

[22:19:38] <Release_> any equillivant of ^\.+$ for all characters ?
[22:20:42] <Release_> to detect any single chars or duplicate only in a sentence wether with or without spaces
[22:21:59] <Release_> to detect like
[22:22:02] <Release_> h
[22:22:03] <Release_> d
[22:22:12] *** Quits: dmaislin (~dmaislin@047-233-046-055.res.spectrum.com) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzzâ€¦)
[22:22:13] <Release_> or gg
[22:22:16] <Release_> and so on
[22:22:51] <Release_> so basically single or repeated chars with and without spaces
[22:23:19] <VectorX> thats like the entire string
[22:23:57] <Release_> not sure i follow VectorX ?
[22:24:58] <VectorX> what does this ^\.+$ mean to you?
[22:25:23] <Release_> single . or duplicate
[22:25:46] <Release_> or more actually
[22:26:07] <VectorX> where are you using this?
[22:26:19] <Release_> on a filter
[22:26:39] <VectorX> where is this filter?
[22:26:49] <Release_> for pcre engine
[22:27:51] <Release_> the filter is in software im using it in
[22:27:57] <Release_> should that matter ?
[22:28:27] <Release_> im trying to find the regex itselve to do the job
[22:31:36] <Release_> the idea is to detect single character wether in duplicates or not and wether with or without spaces
[22:35:41] <VectorX> are you looking for the text or a true false
[22:37:02] <Release_> whats a true false ?
[22:37:23] <Release_> looking for the text i guess
[22:37:25] <VectorX> if you are trying to evaluate the match
[22:37:43] <VectorX> - /^(.)(?=(?:\1| )*$).*$/
[22:40:33] <Release_> sorry got disconnected
[22:41:17] <VectorX> - /^(.)(?=(?:\1| )*$).*$/
[22:41:42] <Release_> tested it and it doesnt seem to get single char
[22:43:15] <VectorX> can you create a https://regex101.com/ example and show me
[22:45:37] <Release_> it works on the web
[22:45:49] <Release_> but not in the software im using it in
[22:45:55] *** shan is now known as shantaram
[22:48:25] <Release_> im using it on an ircd regex filter
[22:51:27] <VectorX> I am not sure what could be the issue with ircd as I gave you a pcre compatible regex
[22:51:31] <Release_> got it fixed
[22:51:38] <VectorX> what was it
[22:51:54] <Release_> it has a space in it ircd filter regex has issues with spaces
[22:52:00] <Release_> it sees it as a seperate param
[22:52:14] <Release_> so i used \s in the space
[22:52:37] <VectorX> glad you got it sorted
[22:52:42] <Release_> /^(.)(?=(?:\1|\s)*$).*$/
[22:52:51] <Release_> thanks VectorX much apreciated
