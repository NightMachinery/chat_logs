I ran it against the sample tests, and it works. But when I attempt to submit it, it fails their full test suite (which doesn't expose the input, so I can't debug). The code looks good to me, even after looking hard at it, so I was wondering if someone here can maybe see if there's something wrong with it.

[01:03:33] <eru> i know for a fact that the dictionaries wont have keys repeating

[01:03:47] <calamari> anon16: What I'd do to debug this is to write a more bloated version of this, where it handles 25/50/100 as separate cases, like a cashier with a cash drawer. Once you get that version working, then you can compare the output at each input step to your algorithm and use that to debug.

[03:28:01] <nedbat> graingert: you're right, it wouldn't work in my case, but for lots of tools, tomli.open_file() would be both more convenient, and easier to enforce the rules.
[03:28:12] <FLHerne> Repiphany: tbh, I don't like that because the comma is pretty hard to spot
[03:28:19] <SnoopJ> tomli.loadfn() maybe?
[03:28:52] <graingert> nedbat: SnoopJ there's a discussion about it on tomli issue 99
[03:28:54] <SnoopJ> nedbat, or are you saying tomli should provide its own open() to be used with load()?
[03:28:59] <FLHerne> so it's easy to misread as just `c = {"a"}` when scanning over the code
[03:29:06] <Repiphany> You can make it more explicit you're doing tuple unpacking with (c,) = {"a"}
[03:29:10] <nedbat> graingert: also i guess coverage needs to pin the version of tomli
[03:29:19] <SnoopJ> graingert, yes, I read it, that's how I know the workaround of doing the open() for the user is an aesthetically-unacceptable way to bridge the matter.
[03:29:22] <FLHerne> Ah, that looks better to me

[04:28:56] <FLHerne> clearly it does, but I can't see why that parses at all
[04:29:34] <bjs> FLHerne: it's the same as `a, b = 1, 2` or `(a, b) = 1, 2`
[04:29:36] <stealth_> FLHerne, same as doing `a, b = 1, 2` but with list
[04:29:45] <bjs> Python lets you put brackets around the left-hand side, but they don't do anything
[04:29:48] <FLHerne> stealth_: "but with list" ?
[04:30:09] <FLHerne> I suppose I should look at the grammar
[04:30:23] <stealth_> FLHerne, list = `[a, b] =` vs tuple (default) `a, b =`

[04:32:04] <dfcnvt> I may need to do a completely different solution... :\
[04:32:32] <stealth_> bjs, i am saying [] as being list
[04:32:51] <bjs> stealth_: I know you are saying that, but I'm saying that in `[a, b] = 1, 2` there is no list anywhere

[04:34:21] <bjs> the brackets are just optional part of the syntax for unpacking used for grouping,  they let you use either "()" or "[]" but give no extra meaning to them.
[04:34:46] <stealth_> yes i was referring to syntax
[04:35:25] <FLHerne> bjs: well, syntactically it is a list, certainly that's what I get in the AST
[04:35:53] <FLHerne> anyway, now I found a new missing feature in my IDE's parser :D
[04:35:58] <Repiphany> (brackets aren't optional for more complicated unpacking, like `(a, b), c = [(1, 2), 3]`)
[04:36:38] <rud0lf> wow, didn't know that's possible
[04:36:42] <rud0lf> can you nest them?

[04:36:53] <FLHerne> "there should be one way to do it"
[04:36:56] <SnoopJ> FLHerne, well, they aren't lists, but they share the same syntax
[04:37:10] <bjs> FLHerne: they're not really lists though, it's just re-using the square bracket syntax
[04:37:10] <FLHerne> SnoopJ: well, I mean as opposed to tuple syntax
[04:37:21] <FLHerne> there's no semantic difference, so why allow both?
[04:37:45] <bjs> FLHerne: I think I prefer the list-like syntax, `[x] = ...` over `x, = ...`
[04:37:51] <SnoopJ> helps differentiate in cases where you have nesting, I guess?
[04:38:01] <SnoopJ> I doubt there was a particular reason, probably it just happened like that.
[04:38:30] <bjs> FLHerne: and when you have some more complicated structure I guess people would want to write something like `[(a, b), (c, d), *rest] = some_list_of_pairs` or something and so it's there to look similar/nice

I guess we get tired of code breaking all time, and hence we silo'd the code with old version.  (Whatever is that called?  silo'd? isolated?)
[04:59:27] <SnoopJ> MetalSutton, that shouldn't affect what you see over RDP, but it's possible it does something else.

[05:00:10] <SnoopJ> dfcnvt, not here it isn't.

[05:04:15] <SnoopJ> Yes, the missing symbol is from SDL
[05:05:35] <SnoopJ> It could be that the version of libsdl present is wrong
[05:05:41] <dfcnvt> I think inside the code, it must have #!/usr/bin/env python/python2.7/python3/python3.9/... or whichever else -- or just plain python for latest.  But not every python script has that line.  Perhaps it should enforce the python script to include that line. Just so, it knows which one this script is asking for that version (if plainly 'python' then it's asking for the latest)...Or if there's no asking, it
[05:05:47] <dfcnvt> will assume for the latest.
[05:06:25] <dfcnvt> I don't know, but that's my continuous rant.
[05:06:51] <dfcnvt> ...Or maybe not -- we'll let the error speaks for itself.
[05:06:51] <SnoopJ> dfcnvt, that is not the case here, as I have said several times now, and wouldn't matter anyway since they are running it with Python, not the shell.

[06:11:53] <SnoopJ> MetalSutton, I think the SDL problem might be because of your libsdl-ttf2.0-0 package.
[06:12:04] <MetalSutton> i just had to delete the file, and I was able to autologin again
[06:12:22] <SnoopJ> It looks like that's from libsdl 2.0.15, and this symbol was changed in 2.0.14. Checking to see if there's an older version you can install.

[06:52:39] <MetalSutton> this is all so confusing.
[06:52:48] <MetalSutton> so many libraries!
[06:52:50] <SnoopJ> MetalSutton, okay, let's hit pause for a second, then.
[06:53:04] <MetalSutton> should i uninstall 2.0.15?
[06:53:18] <SnoopJ> Please don't run any apt commands
[06:53:40] <stealth_> MetalSutton, just know that if you restart that system it will mess up your os (most likely)
[06:53:51] <MetalSutton> hhmm
[06:53:53] <SnoopJ> MetalSutton, I want to be sure you understand what we're trying to do here. The error message you're getting is "undefined symbol," which means something is looking for a symbol (think function) named SDL_RWclose.

[06:55:06] <SnoopJ> I'm pretty sure that's because in 2.0.14 of libsdl this exact symbol was changed in a way that would make it break like this if someone wrote code that used it, but you had an old version of the library that *doesn't* have the symbol. Are you with me so far?

[06:56:33] <SnoopJ> Okay, so since libsdl-ttf-2.0-0 is using a version from *after* 2.0.15, someone writing code for that library might have used SDL_RWclose from after the change. But your libsdl doesn't have it, so we get this error (that's my hypothesis, anyway). The goal is to install some other version of this package from before 2.0.14, when the change happened.
[06:57:03] <SnoopJ> I think I just goofed up the apt command I gave you, and it looked at what we asked it to do and said "nope, already have that one, we're good!"
[06:57:51] <MetalSutton> ill paste the output for you
[06:58:17] <MetalSutton> https://bpa.st/DLKA
[06:58:52] <SnoopJ> Um, that's even weirder.
[06:59:25] <MetalSutton> technically it never said anything along the lines of "success", it just stopped there.
[07:00:03] <SnoopJ> It says that libsdl-ttf2.0-0 is a NEW package
[07:00:19] <SnoopJ> which means it wasn't installed before, which it definitely seems to be in the output of the list command.
[07:00:26] <SnoopJ> MetalSutton, are you connecting to this rpi from a linux machine?

[07:19:41] <SnoopJ> MetalSutton, I think this is a good point to send you over to #raspberrypi to ask for help, they'll be able to look for some of the information I've been asking for without all this back-and-forth (I don't have a running pi handy). Tell them you're running Buster and that you want libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 from *before* version 2.0.14
[07:20:06] <MetalSutton> ok will do. Thanks very much
[07:20:07] <SnoopJ> MetalSutton, it's part of SDL that does font stuff. TTF stands for TrueType Font
[07:20:19] <MetalSutton> really?!?!
[07:20:28] <MetalSutton> all this over a font
[07:20:32] <SnoopJ> It's not "a font"
[07:20:38] <SnoopJ> it's code that helps you *draw* using fonts.
[07:20:50] <SnoopJ> Don't worry about it, trust me, pygame needs this for a good reason.
[07:20:52] <MetalSutton> yeah i mean, i suppose it handles all fonts.
[07:21:25] <SnoopJ> Right, you can feed it a font in TrueType Font format, and it knows how to turn that into nice-looking images of letters

[07:23:43] <SnoopJ> ah, okay. Well, as long as you lay the problem out and tell them you want that package from before 2.0.14, they can probably get you the rest of the way, and will know the best place to find the package etc.
[07:27:19] <SnoopJ> Sorry that we weren't able to get the problem fixed, but at least there's a decent guess about what's broken. If you do manage to install another version and it fixes that problem, I'd love to hear about it.
[07:28:02] <MetalSutton> yeah ill update you tonight
[07:28:27] <MetalSutton> its ok im not in a rush to get it sorted, ill just chip away at all this learning stuff.
[07:28:52] <SnoopJ> you've snagged on a heck of an incompatibility, so don't feel too bad if it's kinda mysterious.
[07:29:24] <SnoopJ> I could be completely wrong about this, mind. It's a big enough thing that I'm surprised I can't find any mention of other people having this problem with pygame on raspbian...

[10:14:00] <KirkMcDonald> No.
[10:15:06] <KirkMcDonald> This is impractical even if you only have Python code, but this would become an immense problem as soon as those dependencies include any extension modules.

[10:16:27] <KirkMcDonald> But honestly your API would very quickly start to look like something you use to deploy code to production in the first place.
[10:16:54] <reumeth> Repiphany: It would probably be too slow if I have say 1000 different functions every 10 minutes I want executed, or maybe I'm wrong?
[10:17:06] <Repiphany> I'm joking
[10:17:25] <Repiphany> But that's essentially what's involved in pickling a function and all dependencies
[10:17:48] <KirkMcDonald> "Pickling" is the wrong term, because pickle *very specifically* does not send the actual code of functions.
[10:17:59] <reumeth> KirkMcDonald: Yeah, this would never be anywhere near any production stuff. It would be airgapped like crazy
[10:18:20] <KirkMcDonald> reumeth: You're sending requests to it, it's production.

[15:31:05] <bjs> gggp_: better?
[15:31:08] <gggp_> faster
[15:31:17] <bjs> gggp_: well, numpy.max accepts numpy arrays
[15:31:18] <bjs> max doesn't
[15:31:22] <bjs> so ... they're not the same thing
[15:31:32] <gggp_> there is conversion

[15:32:08] <bjs> gggp: numpy.max does a lot more than what maxw() does
[15:32:34] <bjs> gggp: no there's no conversion,  max() just accepts iterables but it doesn't _specifically_ know about numpy arrays, it doesn't know about their shape or axes or anything
[15:32:50] <gggp> cool
[15:33:00] <bjs> gggp: which is faster will probably depend on your situation?  If you have some numpy array and you want the max along a specific axis then numpy.max is *literally designed for that case* so it's probably faster
[15:33:15] <bjs> if you just want the max of a couple of numbers in a list or whatever, then that's why max exists so probably it will be faster

[15:44:38] <rendar> lol yeah
[15:44:53] <rendar> bjs: but are call_soon and call_later used in production, usually? or they are just test functions?
[15:45:39] <rendar> what i have in mind is that, for instance, i could use call_later to call f() which will call later itself (trampoline function) and that f() does in background some checkings, e.g. network speed and so on
[15:45:53] <bjs> rendar: call_soon is a bit specialised, but call_later is clearly useful
[15:45:55] <rendar> is this a common practice in production?

[16:02:31] <euouae> rendar: You can write code that uses threads (for example, OpenMP toolkit for parallelism) in C++ and use that code in python with a foreign function interface
[16:02:43] <bjs> rendar: yes just like you can with C/C++ but it has all the same problems as there
[16:02:44] <rendar> euouae: ok, but that's not my case
[16:02:51] <rendar> bjs: ok
[16:02:55] <euouae> rendar: What is your case?
[16:03:06] <rendar> euouae: something simpler, 100% python
[16:03:15] <bjs> rendar: and is a bad idea in general,  there are ProcessPool's (e.g. that you cna use with run_in_executor) that copy things over and back again when the process starts and ends
[16:03:17] <euouae> nedbat: I guess I'm just curious of how it is achieved
[16:03:33] <euouae> rendar: 100% python is achievable, but what about efficiency? What is your requirement there?
[16:03:44] <rendar> euouae: no matter in efficency
[16:04:02] <euouae> rendar: You can use OpenMPI for python, https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html
[16:04:03] <bjs> euouae: logging libraries almost always have some global state that is the configuration of the logger that logging functions read
[16:04:18] <rendar> computation can take 1s or 5s, it doesn't matter, what matters is that it doesn't clogger the main asyncio loop
[16:04:46] <euouae> rendar: It will take care of splitting your resources in multiple processes; the processes will be in different cores according to the OS scheduler; or even different processors, even across the network
[16:05:23] <bjs> euouae: e.g. the class variable nedbat points to,  when you say eliot.to_file() it appends the file to the class variable nedbat showed and then future logging calls will look at the class variable and append to that file

[16:50:18] <euouae> MetalSutton: It's loading the wrong library
[16:50:18] <Celelibi> Right here! https://github.com/dell/libsmbios/blob/master/src/python/libsmbios_c/smbios_token.py#L134
[16:50:38] <euouae> MetalSutton: Programs can load other libraries (dynamic loading). It is loading an SDL library that doesn't have that symbol
[16:50:47] <bjs> Celelibi: hmm,  this is a bug but not for the reasons we just discussed.  here __iter__ does not raise StopIteration, __iter__ is returning a generator and the generator's __next__ is.
[16:51:08] <euouae> MetalSutton: Thankfully, you can configure which library it should load. All you have to do is install an SDL library somewhere in your system and then point the loader to that path
[16:51:34] <MetalSutton> So i assume i just get an older version of this package?
[16:51:40] <bjs> Celelibi: that would be OK if not for https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/ -- you shouldn't `raise StopIteration` inside a generator >3.7,  you should `return`
[16:52:11] <euouae> MetalSutton: which package?
[16:52:37] <Celelibi> bjs, ok, I'm using python 3.9. That must be why I see this exception popping up.
[16:52:46] <MetalSutton> libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 , the one causing the issues.
[16:52:57] <bjs> Celelibi: that code looks like it'd raise RuntimeError on >3.7
[16:53:06] <euouae> MetalSutton: You can get the latest version if you want
[16:53:10] <bjs> Celelibi: is that what you are seeing?
[16:53:20] <MetalSutton> I have the latest version
[16:53:25] <euouae> MetalSutton: How did you install it?
[16:53:27] <euouae> +
[16:53:35] <Celelibi> bjs, depends how I use it.
[16:53:40] <MetalSutton> I do not recall.
[16:53:59] <euouae> MetalSutton: Where is it installed?
[16:54:02] <Celelibi> bjs, list(libsmbios_c.smbios_token.TokenTable()) raise "RuntimeError: generator raised StopIteration" indeed.
[16:54:05] <bjs> Celelibi: well if it doesn't reach the `raise StopIteration` line you won't get the RuntimeError of course,  is there another different bug?

[16:54:28] <bjs> Celelibi: okay,  you can try change that line to say `return` instead of `raise StopIteration` and the error should be fixed

[17:00:57] <foo> We have an internal shorturl system that generates QR codes if someone adds a /qr at the end of the shorturl, here's the Flask route: https://bpa.st/JIBQ -> this is used both individually if someone wants to download a QR code for a shorturl and it's used in <img ...> tags in a dashboard ti display the QR code (which links to the download link). In the latter use case, I'm noticing loading ~100 qr codes on a

[17:01:03] <foo> page takes a bit of time considering each one is manually generated. I'm thinking of caching these files and if the file is cache returning the cached file for better performanc. I was thinking of caching an md5 of the URL per line 14 in my pastebin... that way I know the QR code is for the given URL. First it'll check if it exists, if not it'll create and save it otherwise return cached version. Anyone have

[22:01:33] <Payam> hi
[22:02:48] <Payam> is it possible to see whether a application is installed on a debian/ubuntu based distro?
[22:03:09] <jochum> Payam: dpkg -l | grep package
[22:03:17] <Payam> from python?
[22:03:21] <Payam> -.-
[22:03:43] <Payam> shutil which
[22:03:46] <jochum> Payam: I know there is a python interface for apt
[22:04:14] <han-solo> `shutil` is a builtin module no ?
[22:04:30] <Payam> yes
[22:04:44] <han-solo> so that comes with every python, i think...
[22:05:02] <han-solo> so if python is installed, that would be available for use. It's not like it is a seperate package

[22:06:01] <SnoopJ> for sure your garden-variety Python is likely to have it
