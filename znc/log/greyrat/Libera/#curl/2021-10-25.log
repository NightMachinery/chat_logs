[12:18:40] <gevaerts> Mondays are no longer WFH days, and whoever made the coffee today has *very* different ideas than me about how strong coffee should be

[12:22:48] <jfuller> ha ... it will change - some random someone's assumption baked into some images that is all
[12:28:45] <gevaerts> I won't complain about having to EDITOR=vim on a properly maintained system where e.g. the main admin prefers emacs, but usually it's nano...
[12:29:34] <jfuller> I dont mind vim, more like 'I know emacs'

[13:49:49] <bagder> they no longer recognize our way of merging as "legitimate" so they require we set a special tag on each PR that are deemed fine
[13:50:27] <jfuller> um
[13:50:31] <bagder> rather annoying
[13:51:18] <bagder> since we merge "manually" with rebase, the hf bots don't see them as real merges
[13:51:30] <jfuller> apart from the obvious churn - I do not understand the rationale
[13:51:54] <bagder> to stop "fake" claims for PR that were just closed, not merged
[13:51:57] <jfuller> I might even question the motive a little but I prob need to understand more
[13:52:27] <bagder> I think they've gone too far
[13:52:31] <jfuller> can they not determine merges from github api (I would have thought)
[13:52:50] <jfuller> seems to be putting the adminstrative onus on us - I guess the return is motivating new work in the repo
[13:52:59] <bagder> they can't, because when we rebase and possibly edit, github can't tell if it is a merge or a new thing
[13:53:21] <bagder> that's at least the theoretical return
[13:53:26] <bagder> I'm skeptical
[13:53:36] <jfuller> I am as well (FWIW)
[13:53:40] <bagder> we've never seen much hf participation
[13:53:53] <bagder> from what I know anyway
[13:53:58] <jfuller> my pref would be to politely say thx but no thx ... feels like one of those things ...
[13:54:39] <bagder> right now, mback2k's work is basically to detect these merges and set the label on *all* PRs merged during October
[13:55:13] <bagder> I'm not convinced that's a good idea
[13:55:15] <jfuller> this could be done on a mirror
[13:55:56] *** Quits: donofrio (~donofrio@c-68-40-123-74.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:57:04] <jfuller> mbback2k could just generate a report we send 
[13:57:15] <jfuller> instead of mutations on the repo
[13:58:13] <bagder> I don't think so: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/maintainers
[13:58:48] <jfuller> well then this is about advertising hacktoberfest more then anything in a nice distributed sticky way
[13:59:19] <jfuller> I am not against such things perse, but what happens when Decemberfest or AugustFun competition ccomes around
[13:59:27] <jfuller> kantian ideal states this is prob wasted effort
[13:59:32] <bagder> that's exactly what I've been saying and thinking
[13:59:55] <bagder> but okay, as long as there's only one...
[14:00:03] <mback2k> hey together
[14:00:12] <jfuller> making a special case for a single project needs special motivation
[14:00:36] <mback2k> I understand your concers, but I guess Hacktoberfest is a little different then anything that may be coming, because it has already been running a few years
[14:01:14] <bagder> but it also a popular thing, which is why we might see others follow suit
[14:01:31] <mback2k> I also don't like their approach of requiring the labels and I also think GitHub could detect our way of merging, but right now the labels would be the only way to become compatible
[14:02:13] <jfuller> digital ocean, deepsource
[14:02:19] <jfuller> https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/
[14:02:40] <jfuller> I would like to know more about what participation means 
[14:02:48] <jfuller> and what digitalocean and friends get out of this
[14:03:09] <mback2k> you need to register with your GitHub or GitLab account, curl does not do that, but the people opening PRs
[14:05:20] <jfuller> I wonder what the terms say on that registrion of github account
[14:06:11] <jfuller> not overly paranoid - ppl can contrib to curl ... if hacktoberfest blocks that contribution I would say its their problem to solve
[14:06:45] <jfuller> or not - I have no doubt hacktoberfest intentions are correct but its run by digitalocean
[14:07:09] <jfuller> and they have lots of resources or they can convince other people ... I am not convinced ;)
[14:07:38] <icing> backward compatibility not easy: https://github.com/rustls/rustls-ffi/commit/fbbf99b839a610216607e6e4512f7cf5db4ce169#commitcomment-58602741
[14:07:43] <jfuller> perhaps we have a generic competition tag ;)
[14:09:42] <mback2k> jfuller: they basically support 2 ways of marking a PR as approved: using the standard PR merge functionality of GitHub/GitLab or marking it with the label. GitHub would need to change their API or allow us to put a setting on the curl repo declaring that PRs "closed" with a "Closes ..." reference on master can be considered "merged" instead.
[14:11:03] <mback2k> I could also try to avoid the intermediate label for PRs opened in October and just set the accepted label. That won't be highly visible, because it would just be on closed PRs anyway.
[14:11:31] <jfuller> I think I understand their problem - like I said I am not personally motivated by it ... dont let my opinion demotivate anyone else
[14:11:56] <mback2k> Also my plan is to follow up with another change later that will remove all labels in late November.
[14:12:14] <jfuller> the real thing that caught my eye was in their FAW
[14:12:17] <jfuller> /FAW/FAQ
[14:12:30] <mback2k> and that was?
[14:12:40] <jfuller> where it states something to the effect 'doesnt align with the core values of hacktoberfest'
[14:12:52] <jfuller> #49 https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq
[14:13:04] <jfuller> I guess curl project does not align
[14:13:04] -curelbot- [GitHub] PR #49: Tests code updated for build with MS Visual Studio (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/49)
[14:13:40] <jfuller> simply because we do not solve their problem
[14:14:27] <mback2k> I guess that answer is a little bit incomplete
[14:14:59] <mback2k> sorry, I have to leave again. bagder : maybe you can leave your final opinion about my PR as a review. bye bye
