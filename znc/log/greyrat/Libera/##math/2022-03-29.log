[01:26:48] <Z-module> In the same way, an inch is officially defined as 2.54 cm exactly.
[01:26:49] <zzz> the metric system base was changed in 2019
[01:27:35] <zzz> hence redefining the international system
[01:29:19] <CarloWood> I have a problem involving a graph...  I have a directional graph that exist of black and white nodes. Every edge is always from black to white, or from white to black.
[01:29:34] <greenbagels> That is called a bipartite graph
[01:29:55] <greenbagels> So a directional bipartite graph for short
[01:30:05] <greenbagels> Directed*
[01:31:12] <zzz> TIL: The conversion factor between the kilogram and the international pound was therefore chosen to be divisible by 7 with a terminating decimal representation, and an (international) grain is thus equal to exactly 64.79891 milligrams.
[01:31:18] <CarloWood> I want to find the "shortest" loop; where a certain strategy must be followed: if you are on a white node, you choose the path that leads to the shortest loop - if you are on a black node you choose the path that leads to a longest shortest loop, if you get what I mean.
[01:32:26] <CarloWood> I am not even sure there is a stable answer :/.  But I know that the graph is such that there IS an answer.  But I can't think of an algorithm to find it.
[01:34:29] <CarloWood> I suppose that IF you know the answer to the question: what is the length of the loop that will be followed with this strategy - then you can check that it is correct: ie, every node is marked with the length of the (eventual) loop length - then from any node just go to the node with the largest or smallest number in it, depending on whether you're on white or black.
[01:35:07] <CarloWood> But before you fill in all numbers, you don't know what number each node has, and therefore also not what path to pick :/.
[01:35:18] <CarloWood> How can I write an algorithm for this?

[01:41:06] <CarloWood> greenbagels: for example this image: https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/courses/csci2824/images/l28f2.jpg  if red tries to get the shortest loop and green the longest then green would want to avoid v3, because then red will go back to u2 from where green must go to v3 - and the loop is super short: 2.  Therefore green wants to avoid u2 and thus v1, so being on u4 - green would pick v5 (assuming that leads also to a loop:
[01:41:06] <CarloWood> every node does; that is longer than 2).

[01:44:57] <CarloWood> The background is I am trying to solve a chess problem on an infinite quarter board: king+rook against king. Assuming the black king that has to be mated is very far from the two edges, the question is: what strategy will push it towards an edge the fastest.

[01:46:02] <CarloWood> I made a graph where the node are unique as function of their positions relative to eachother - so that if you reach the same position then you are on the same node - but you are probably closer to an edge then before.
[01:47:24] <CarloWood> So, black tries to hop to nodes (relative positions) where it will take as long as many moves as possible before they reach the same position closer to the edge - and white tries to make that happen as fast as possible.
[01:48:26] <CarloWood> If I can solve the graph problem then I can I use the same program to investigate much harder problems, like K+Q against K+N.
[01:49:23] <CarloWood> What I did was just limit the distance between the pieces to a maximum of 9 (so the board is like 19x19 with the black king always in the middle).
[01:49:42] <CarloWood> Plus the rook can also go to "infinite" distance.
[01:50:04] <CarloWood> That way the state space is about 288000 nodes. Not much for a computer.

[03:15:23] <orbisvicis> isekaijin: a while back you suggested I used a factor (alpha) for multivariate newton's method, specifically: x_{n+1} = x_n - alpha * [Jf(x_n)]^{-1} f(x_n)
[03:15:34] <orbisvicis> isekaijin, should the factor be applied before or after inverting?
[03:16:13] <isekaijin> It doesn't matter. The factor is a real number in ]0,1[, most likely around 0.7.
[03:17:17] <isekaijin> (Actually, the “correct” way to do it is to investigate the geometry of the function's graph before picking alpha, but nobody has time for that, so you just pick “something reasonable”.)

[03:26:02] <orbisvicis> isekaijin: yes my derivatives have a lot of exponentials tending to extremes very quickly. I thought I'd use symmetric log rather than a factor (of which 0.7 was best) but it performs horribly
[03:26:29] <isekaijin> Oh.
[03:27:19] <orbisvicis> Interestingly if I apply alpha to the inverse, then the factor performs horribly and symmetric log performs slightly better than a non-inverted factor

[03:28:22] <orbisvicis> But I'm cheating and inverting my jacobian, applying alpha, re-inverting, then passing it to my solver -> that's how I apply alpha after inverting
[03:29:14] <isekaijin> There's no single universally good method for solving equations.

[06:03:37] <snake> actually no
[06:03:56] <snake> the directions just say to find all 6 trig fn values given the first two relations
[06:04:15] <ihate> i don't know what that means
[06:04:35] <ihate> cos(t) = 4 and cot(t)<0?
[06:04:37] <snake> we're given cos(t) = 4 and cot(t) < 0
[06:04:42] <snake> yes
[06:04:43] <ihate> good luck with that
[06:04:58] <snake> find sin t, cos t, and cot t
[06:05:05] <ihate> not going to happen
[06:05:08] <snake> oh shit it is supposed to be csc(t) = 4

[06:09:43] <ihate> i won't be able to help with sage, sorry.
[06:09:47] <snake> ok thanks anyways
[06:09:53] <snake> wonder ifthere is a sage channel actually
[06:09:59] <snake> didnt think about that until just now
[06:10:00] <ihate> I was just triggered by the cos(t) = 4 lol
[06:10:07] <snake> lol understandable
[06:12:11] <ihate> you can also try the Matlab/mathematica/octave channels. iirc something like those exist

[06:33:43] <ihate> once I had twins with the same first name (diff. middle). They'd only write their first names on quizzes :(
[06:34:08] <snake> ihate, zero?
[06:34:15] <ihate> *together strong* i guess
[06:34:16] <snake> or perhaps 50%
[06:34:17] <maroon> once in high school we had a snow-day make-up day after we took the final, so the teacher just had us go over our exams to cover what was the true answers. i had only gotten 1 question marked wrong, and when we came to this one, the teacher had the wrong answer applied to everyone, so several of us got it right but we were all marked wrong
[06:34:43] <ihate> snake I should have just given them the average lol
[06:34:51] <maroon> the teacher said he wouldnt change it unless it made a difference between a/b b/c etc. and he wouldnt change mine to 100% because that was a-to-a

[06:38:43] <Plazma> just from talking with others
[06:38:53] <ihate> interesting. I've noticed it as well
[06:38:57] <snake> maroon, what'd you do to them
[06:39:06] <maroon> or just trying to get by with the minimum
[06:40:03] <maroon> that 1st test where he wouldnt move me up to 100%, he was recently back after missing several months due to an injury - he slipped on a dog turd while mowing the lawn, and got his foot nipped by the lawnmower blade
[06:41:12] <Plazma> ihate it's more of an attiude problem i think, last semester my TA's were rockstars, this time not too bad, i had one that is an athlete and didn't answer any emails until last week
[06:41:37] <Plazma> overall yea, they don't take the duties as a job, seriously and it's a common problem

[11:15:54] <bj33> When did people first defined how rational exponents should work? I can understand that if you raise an integer by a natural number, you just multiply that integer by itself a <natural number> of times, but how does rational exponents work?
[11:18:27] <ihate54> gist: if x = y^n, then define x^(1/n) to be y.
[11:20:21] <ihate54> from this, you get easily x^(p/q) for x rational.
[11:20:30] <ihate54> and p,q integers
[11:20:47] <ihate54> for the rest, use approximates of irrationals by rationals
[11:21:19] <Fangs> you have to make a choice of 'x' though, since there might be more than one such number
[11:22:01] <somiaj> bj33: for positive integer powers we have the property that (x^a)^b = x^(a*b), and we know that n-root(x^n) = x (for positive x)
[11:22:03] <ihate54> "gist"
[11:22:31] <ihate54> I think you mean choice of y.
[11:22:59] <somiaj> bj33: so to ensure that property holds it makes sense that (x^n)^(1/n) = x^(n *1/n) = x^1 -- hence x^(1/n) and n-root(x) have the same property, so seems like a reasonable definition.
[11:23:07] <ihate54> e.g., x = y^2 = (-y)^2

[12:08:26] <river> what is the confusion wth real numbers
[12:08:34] <river> we have axioms that uniquely determine them
[12:08:37] <ihate54> i can agree that our notions are practically the same
[12:09:36] <taeaad> I didn't follow the discussion. The only case where the definition can differ is when you insist on only working with countable infinities, in which case your notion of the real numbers no longer captures continuity. Continuity is one of the key reasons why we want real numbers in the first place.
[12:09:38] <blueberrycrop> nevermind... it was a classic scammer
[12:09:49] <blueberrycrop> i thought it was a real human

[12:10:33] <ihate54> there are no real humans here
[12:10:51] <blueberrycrop> they seem real
[12:11:01] <taeaad> The place where I think there is style to the matter is whether you prefer neighbourhoods or convergence, for example. Or for example whether you find Dedekind or Cauchy more intuitive.
[12:11:07] <blueberrycrop> "Tssss" is a phrase people use around here... and the scammer knew it.
[12:11:15] <river> > Skolem (1922) pointed out the seeming contradiction between the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem on the one hand, which implies that there is a countable model of Zermelo's axioms, and Cantor's theorem on the other hand, which states that uncountable sets exist, and which is provable from Zermelo's axioms
[12:11:24] <river> that is bizarre isn't it
[12:12:12] <river> I think they key thing about logic, that we learned from godel and turing and so on is the connection between formal logic and computation
[12:12:32] <taeaad> Hausdorf's original texts are excellent for the historical perspective, but unfortunately I don't read German and apparently the translation is less informative than the first edition German (of his book).

[12:20:19] <taeaad> The notion of infinity is not always used to mean infinity in a literal sense. For example, in computation, consider trying to find a theorem via a halting process. You set it up in this way: If it halts, the theorem is true, if it terminates, the theorem is false. Suppose that the program is actually not computable. Suppose that the program just keeps running everytime you check on it: Now you have two outcomes: The theorem is true or
[12:20:19] <taeaad> it is uncomputable (or even both since metamathematically the theorem could be true). Infinity now means two things: the theorem is true and/or the theorem is not computable. You can't know which one, even if somehow (i.e. in the infinite case) you know the program doesn't halt.

[12:22:13] <taeaad> So infinity can sometimes encaptulate two things (the theorem is true and/or the theorem is not computable). For me this explains how infinity in the mathematics doesn't mean infinity in the computation, rather it means nontermination. And now you could have a connection between for example "infinity" and partial functions, since you could just as well have modelled the computation as a function where elements that do not compute are
[12:22:14] <taeaad> not assigned to anything in the codomain.

[12:23:21] <taeaad> Take this with a grain of salt, but interpretation and mathematics have this inherent quality that the two need a bridge before you can assign physical meaning.
[12:23:31] <Fangs> river: im not a constructivist by any means, but most of the 'non-constructive' proof I came across are usually of the form: "prove: not Q -> not P" instead of "prove: P -> Q"
[12:23:53] <Fangs> and then to be annoying, add the unecessary assumption that "Q", and call it a proof by contradiction
[12:24:13] <Fangs> (its a proof of the contrapositive!)
[12:24:14] <taeaad> Note that "not computable" is not the same as "doesn't halt". It means that it gives a contradiction if it halts and it gives a contradiction if it doesn't halt.
[12:24:57] <Fangs> other non-constructive maths are usually some use of 'choice'. "choose a maximal ideal in this ascending chain of ideals" etc
[12:26:02] <bj33> Oof, that's too high level for me. But I'll get there. Thanks for the help, gentlemen.
[12:26:04] <taeaad> The other reason why real numbers get used rather often is that they are successful in practical application. This approach does not pressuppose any metamathematical meaning, it just gives an incentive to keep using and studying the reals. I think this is how physicists approach the matter, since physics at its core needs observable predictions.

[13:43:00] <Franciman> isekaijin: it must be noted that FOL theories can pin down the sizes of models, but only to a finite ordinal
[13:43:18] <Franciman> as soon as you have an infinite model, then you can't count anymore
[13:44:27] <Franciman> to say you want a model of only 2 elements, you add this axiom: \forall x. \forall y. \forall z. x /= y -> x = z or y = z
[13:44:51] <Franciman> cadmio: yes, this is elementary algebra
[13:45:02] <Franciman> x + (1 + a) = x - (-(1 + a))
[13:45:05] <Franciman> alternatively
[13:45:12] <Franciman> cadmio: one thing i want to stress tho
[13:45:19] <Franciman> algebra is very "concrete", you can test things
[13:45:30] <Franciman> you have definitions ok. So do check if your understanding is correct by performing the computations
[13:45:40] <Franciman> polynomials are very tangible entities
[13:45:46] <Franciman> do substitute and see if your understanding is correct
[13:45:48] <cadmio> ok now since in that field I've found the element 1+a
[13:46:14] <cadmio> I need to show that 1+a and -1-a are in the same residue class, right?

[13:52:38] <Franciman> ok
[13:52:49] <Franciman> seems about right
[13:52:56] <cadmio> so the 2nd root must be one of those
[13:53:03] <Franciman> ok
[13:53:11] <Franciman> so you must find the equivalent of -(1 + a)
[13:53:20] <cadmio> right
[13:53:25] <Franciman> cadmio: are you familiar with modular arithmetic?
[13:54:17] <Franciman> i mean you can view Z_5(a) = { k_1 * 1 + k_2 * a : k_1, k_2 \in Z_5 }
[13:54:22] <Franciman> so you have
[13:54:29] <cadmio> so g + 1 +a in (x^2 + x + 1), where g is the element
[13:54:30] <Franciman> and the description is unique
[13:54:42] <Franciman> there is also another way
[13:54:49] <Franciman> let me explain to you
[13:54:55] <Franciman> this one, so you know another way
[13:55:09] <Franciman> -(1 + a) = -1 * 1 + (-1)* a

[14:03:28] <cadmio> first the computation
[14:03:52] <Franciman> good luck losing your time
[14:04:18] <Franciman> the thing is that you can do that computation in a much easier way, using the theorems you proved about finite field extensions
[14:04:49] <cadmio> yes see in the index for stuff I've already proved
[14:05:46] <Franciman> it's very easy
[14:06:04] <Franciman> -(1 + a) , by definition of Z_5(a) must be equal to k_1 + k_2 * a
[14:06:10] <Franciman> with k_1 , k_2 in Z_5
[14:06:13] <Franciman> SO
[14:06:20] <Franciman> k_1 = -1 mod 5
[14:06:24] <Franciman> k_2 = -1 mod 5
[14:06:38] <Franciman> this seems an easier equation to solve than: g + (1 + a) = q * (x^2 + x + 1)
[14:06:53] <Franciman> algebra isn't about being able to perform the hardest problem. But being able to solve hard problems in simple ways
[14:07:11] <Franciman> you transformed your problem. You didn't avoid it
[14:07:17] <cadmio> correct
[14:09:44] <cadmio> so it'd be 4a +4
[14:09:58] <cadmio> or 4x +4 in Z_5[x]/(p(x))
[14:10:14] <Franciman> yes, we call it 4a + 4, right?
[14:10:26] <Franciman> so cadmio observe, how the very hard problem has been transformed in a no brainer
[14:10:29] <Franciman> you found your g

[16:11:49] <gurkenglas> Suppose I'm a bookie for a prediction market and I need to figure out how much to loan each trader for betting on each outcome. There's a vector variable x of outcomes, each entry 0 or 1. There's a matrix M of how much each trader gets/loses for each outcome. There's a vector b saying how much $ each trader currently has. I want to bound the sum of negative values of Mx+b, and in particular I want to
[16:11:55] <gurkenglas> figure out, given some change to M (some bet) that some trader wants to make, whether it'll worsen the bound more than, say, the allowance that this trader has for such worsenings based on his portion of the sum of all balances.
[16:12:02] <gurkenglas> Can you recommend me an ansatz, keywords, literature?

[18:47:40] <sek> I spent the morning being very confused because I realised it is not known which complex varieties are topological manifolds
[18:48:59] <sek> of course a smooth variety gives a complex manifold, and this is clearly a topological manifold. On the other hand, there are singular ones which also admit homeomorphic euclidean planes as opens (eg, cuspidal or nodal curve), but there are rather hairy singularities which do not admit a euclidean nbhd, and it's not clear to me whether this is well understood

[22:39:01] <dwigton_> Having coined 'threeven' above I felt duty bound to provide multiplication rules. Redefine evens and odds as 2n and 2n + 1. Threevens have 3n, 3n+1, and 3n+2 varients. 3n*3n=3n, 3n*(3n+1)=3n+1, 3n*(3n+2)=3n+2, (3n+1)*(3n+1)=3n+1, (3n+1)*(3n+2)=3n+2, (3n+2)*(3n+2)=3n+1. Now to get third graders to memorize.
