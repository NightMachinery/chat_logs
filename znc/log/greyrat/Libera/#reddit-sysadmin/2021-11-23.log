[00:01:02] <Jaelae> yea i know i think we talked about this before
[00:01:04] <vinrock> i did masonry for 7years
[00:01:04] <Jaelae> well shit man
[00:01:08] <Jaelae> you would have saved me a lot of money
[00:01:17] <vinrock> i might've been able to hook you up with a good contactor

[00:01:25] <Jaelae> or help me improve my masonry skills
[00:01:26] <Jaelae> lol
[00:01:28] <vinrock> ha
[00:01:42] <vinrock> im assuming you have old steps, brick capped off with concrete
[00:01:44] <Jaelae> so you owuld like this. i bought this house and the front steps were ok but there was a little design in the top stone
[00:01:47] <Jaelae> bingo
[00:01:47] <vinrock> thats what i usualy see in nj
[00:02:01] <vinrock> so what did they do, knock off the broken steps, build a form around the base and re-pour on top?
[00:02:09] <Jaelae> the design on the top stone was sunken down a bit - which was dumb because it freezes
[00:02:23] <Jaelae> they removed all limestone, and left most of the  brick
[00:02:36] <Jaelae> and formed a new base of sort and rendered it on the the side and front
[00:02:39] <Jaelae> then new limestone on top
[00:02:40] <vinrock> thats not bad to bang it out in a single day
[00:02:49] <vinrock> we'd usually take two for those
[00:02:50] <Jaelae> i opted to reuse my existing railing
[00:03:00] <Jaelae> so they simply cleaned it up, painted it and are installing that
[00:03:44] <Jaelae> i think they took on a few jobs on my street this week so figured if they can get it all done its easier 
[00:04:13] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> my whole front is red flagstone, like the sidewalk but my porch is just concrete, would be cool to have done flagstone on the top

[03:33:35] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies aren’t really fans of rushing to the hospital to give birth. Their chosen method is rather disgusting as well. House flies will lay their eggs on items such as feces, rotting carcasses, and decaying fruit. Why is this? Well, it’s mainly to provide the larvae (maggots) with something to eat when they hatch.
[03:33:48] <TurkeyGibby> :(
[03:33:50] <TurkeyGibby> !flyfact
[03:33:50] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Ever wondered why it’s so difficult to swat a fly? Well, it’s pretty much down to their quick reaction times and their agility. House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.

[05:25:11] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Ever wondered why it’s so difficult to swat a fly? Well, it’s pretty much down to their quick reaction times and their agility. House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.

[06:11:10] <TurkeyGibby> Years and years ago we had this guy in our IT class that would pipe up with really random stories when the professor would ask questions. The narrative would meander around a loose concept sometimes related to the topic at hand.

One time 
[06:11:10] <TurkeyGibby> chawnsee closed a laptop with a thumbdrive on the keyboard and wouldn't admit to it-- even though it was his user as last logged in. chawnsee was the butt of every joke, every issue, and everything bad in those classes.

[06:14:34] <a1> !flyfacts
[06:14:34] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Studies show that theres a specific region within the eyes of a male fly called the love spot. It is pretty much used for detecting and chasing female flies. This spot is located within the dorsofrontal region of their eyes. This is typically used to detect small target motion, however, males also use it to stay locked onto potential mates during aerial pursuit.

[06:29:52] <mistiry> keurig i never seem to like the coffees, idk if its just the flavors i had or the strength or what
[06:30:16] <misspwn_> tbh it wouldn't matter, i put enough freaking coffee creamer in it to turn it a pasty ass shade
[06:30:21] <TurkeyGibby> I'm going to sound like a basic bitch here, but Starbucks Pike Place is my go-to
[06:30:27] <mistiry> i currently drink Dunkin Donuts OG roast and use their "Extra Extra" creamer. splash of that and im good to go.

[06:30:36] <cryptic1> its a sham
[06:30:39] <misspwn_> lawl
[06:30:40] <cryptic1> a ruse

[06:31:18] <mistiry> yeah i cant do black coffee
[06:31:20] <TurkeyGibby> no creamer for me-- black or maybe one Sweet n Low
[06:31:30] <cryptic1> 1 cream 1 sugar for me
[06:31:36] <mistiry> dont like sweet n low, too artificial tasting
[06:31:44] <mistiry> cant do any of the artificial sweeteners really
[06:31:44] <misspwn_> no idea how much goes in
[06:31:50] <cryptic1> sweet n low tastes like battery acid
[06:31:56] <sd> 05<M​emer> For me, plenty of creamer, no sugar
[06:32:00] <mistiry> same, i just dump the shit in and stir it and thats it

[06:32:24] <cryptic1> powder gets snorted mistiry 
[06:32:26] <misspwn_> it's liquid kinda , work buys the french vanilla coffee creamer
[06:32:33] <cryptic1> liquid goes in the drink
[06:32:41] <misspwn_> and i just go idk dump a bunch in until it's super light and diabetes

[06:46:59] <xe0n> ^^
[06:47:00] <xe0n> that
[06:47:18] <JollyRgrs> @Memer best way is using a CLI and fire up weechat

[06:48:08] <mistiry> if you can handle CLI, weechat is great.
[06:48:15] <mistiry> idk the Mac clients
[06:49:07] <mistiry> but if you plan to stay on IRC long-term, something like using a VM or VPS with scree/tmux and then weechat is best, so that your client is always connected and you can ssh into the VM/VPS and screen -r/tmux a to see it

[07:08:46] <TurkeyGibby> Don't think that works for everyone though
[07:08:54] <misspwn_> they must just not move like ever, don't bend down no shenanigans

[07:09:59] <TurkeyGibby> Never had the chance to have proper long LONG hair

[07:12:31] <misspwn_> nothin like yanking it out from your headset
[07:12:42] <Memer> I've accepted that I lose a strand every few days to the headset
[07:12:59] <Memer> it is a sacrifice
[07:13:12] <misspwn_> at least that amount, happend a few times today actually. and then add a face mask on top of it
[07:13:29] <misspwn_> plus side to the mask, i can hide my resting bitch face
[07:13:36] <Memer> It's particularly annoying with glasses
[07:13:45] <Memer> because if even one strand falls in front of your face, it's extremely visible
[07:14:30] <Work-BWMerlin> How's the job hunting misspwn_
[07:14:57] <misspwn_> ah yes, it's been 4 years now since wearing glasses. i still find myself pushing them up or bracing for them to fog when going indoors

[07:15:27] <Memer> I'm going in to an optometrist to look into contacts as of this Friday, actually
[07:16:05] <misspwn_> Memer, see if they can get you a few pairs of trial ones to test out before getting a full amount if you've not used them before
[07:16:10] <mistiry> Memer: sounds like something your client settings would control
[07:16:43] <misspwn_> i was so blind that it was not easy to do contacts. i was 20/500 now i am 20/15. i couldn't see putting the lens on correctly and would panic every time
[07:16:47] <mistiry> Memer: like with weechat, there is a plugin that colorizes nicknames for easy viewing

[07:36:20] <mikespears> also if you monitor your shit, even if an IP is blacklisted, it's not a huge deal.. just tell the customer to fix their shit, then sell them managed services if they can't :)

[07:42:27] <cryptic1> incorrect
[07:42:31] <cryptic1> I am boring
[07:42:36] <Memer> There we go, I walked myself back through what I was going to ask. I know in the discord help channel, we're not meant to ask "school questions" or "basic stuff" - but if I have something I'm curious about that's not homework-based, are we allowed to discuss it in here?
[07:42:46] <Memer> Specifically in *this* channel/IRC
[07:42:52] <Work-BWMerlin> https://ibin.co/6NbpE8aYVVPt.png
[07:42:52] <Work-BWMerlin> .76 is the client
[07:43:11] <cryptic1> Memer: like a question from school? a theory question?
[07:43:42] <Memer> Theory questions, questions I come up with while *doing* classwork, things like that
[07:43:46] <cryptic1> asking for us to answer homework questions is frowned upon but discussing theory is ok
[07:44:41] <cryptic1> its ok to ask questions if you don't understand something fully
[07:45:41] <Memer> For an example case, I had a question where I was meant to edit an MSI file to function properly, and the standard program used was ORCA. I ended up using InstEd to modify the file instead. Would that be frowned upon in the industry?
[07:45:44] <cryptic1> mikespears: I was only kidding with you :P
[07:45:55] <mikespears> I know lol
[07:46:04] <Memer> And cheers for the clarification cryptic1
[07:46:27] <cryptic1> in the industry use whatever tool works to get the job done
[07:46:45] <Memer> Fair enough
[07:47:01] <Memer> I just have a lot of "curiosity" questions that pop up *while* I'm doing classwork, that I don't really know where to ask
[07:47:32] <cryptic1> ultimately a business will have a need or a problem that you will need to resolve
[07:48:08] <cryptic1> how you get there is not really a problem unless it costs a lot of $ and is not bugeted for
[07:48:33] <cryptic1> s/bugeted/budgeted
[07:48:33] <layer8> cryptic1 meant: "how you get there is not really a problem unless it costs a lot of $ and is not budgeted for"
[07:48:50] <Memer> Gotcha, that makes sense. So there's a lot more freedom in the industry, pick your tools and use 'em
[07:48:58] <cryptic1> exactly
[07:49:12] <Memer> Makes sense.
[07:49:24] <cryptic1> its not going to be like a college or university course where they only want you to use one tool
[07:49:37] <cryptic1> solve the problem and move on to the next thing
[07:50:29] <Memer> Yeah, definitely makes a lot of sense.
[07:53:44] <xe0n> yes and no re: freedom, its not just use anything, if your workplace has a process in place, best to use the tools specified there
[07:53:58] <cryptic1> of course
[07:54:18] <Work-BWMerlin> So I *think* I am right in that the connection is being closed by the server
[07:54:19] <cryptic1> unless you work with xe0n 
[07:54:29] <cryptic1> then do exactly the opposite of what he suggest
[07:54:32] <TurkeyGibby> download tor and install all the tools you need
[07:54:35] <Memer> Other things I'd be liable to ask are basically very specific powershell curiosities, and weird error occurrences I run into
[07:54:35] <cryptic1> like his coworker
[07:54:46] <cryptic1> s/coworker/coworkers
[07:54:47] <layer8> cryptic1 meant: "like his coworkers"
[07:54:49] <TurkeyGibby> Make sure to keep those ssh connections open for several days at a time
[07:55:04] <cryptic1> DC promo all your exchange servers /s
[07:55:07] <TurkeyGibby> Share malware in teams
[07:55:29] <TurkeyGibby> Wait, this is stuff not to do, my b
[07:55:33] <Memer> Oh, by the way, I'm sure I will end up doing so someday - but *never* have me implement a GPO
[07:56:21] <Memer> I'm fairly certain I broke my mock DC pretty bad with something as basic as a GPO to disable Cortana
[07:56:29] <xe0n> lol
[07:56:39] <TurkeyGibby> if you do winderz shit, you're going to be doing that somewhat often 
[07:56:44] <cryptic1> yeah just don't do stuff like that
[07:56:49] <cryptic1> leave default as much as you can
[07:56:57] <TurkeyGibby> so its time to get good at it in a lab
[07:56:58] <Memer> TurkeyGibby: Shoot, I just finished doing everything you recommended, and now you tell me *not* to?
[07:57:24] <cryptic1> lol
[07:57:25] <xe0n> Work-BWMerlin: well...yeah sounds like an application thing lol
[07:57:27] <TurkeyGibby> the security team will be knocking on your door
[07:57:27] <TurkeyGibby> I assure you
[07:58:21] <Memer> Basically everything I've learned from my brief time here tells me "Seriously, make sure you start in a Jr. role"
[07:58:42] <Memer> I do *not* know enough to be unable to ask questions about things yet
[08:00:39] <Work-BWMerlin> Is there anyway via wireshark to tell which application is closing the connection?

[08:32:01] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many 
[08:32:01] <d1> computer use version of the GNU system every day, without ...
[08:32:01] <d1> ... realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program allocates the machine’s resources to 
[08:32:01] <d1> the other programs that you run. The kernel is an ...
[08:32:01] <d1> ... essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU//Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
[08:32:16] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, WSL. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free app in the Microsoft Store and part of a fully functioning Windows system made useful by the Windows OS, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS 
[08:32:16] <d1> as defined by POSIX. 
[08:32:16] <d1> Many computer users run a modified version of the WSL system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of WSL which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Windows system, developed by Microsoft. 
[08:32:16] <d1> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the app: the program in the system that wastes the machine's resources to limit the other programs that you run. The app is an optional part of an operating system, but useless by itself, 
[08:32:16] <d1> it can only function in the context of a complete Windows operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Windows operating system: the whole system is basically Windows with Linux added, or WSL. All the so-called "Linux" apps are really flavors of WSL.

[10:26:40] <csws> the optical out into the fiio was a bit of a hack because of some issues with port detection originally

[10:26:44] *** Joins: thegodsquirrel (~thegodsqu@user/thegodsquirrel)
[10:26:48] <A-KO> the audio industry has moved to things like Dolby Atmos
[10:26:49] <csws> realtek gives me the shits
[10:27:00] <A-KO> but PCs don't support it, and can't
[10:27:03] <A-KO> because it requires HDCP
[10:27:33] <A-KO> the closest you get to it is Dolby Atmos for headphones
[10:28:31] <csws> I just can't believe jack detection is still such a disaster
[10:29:43] <Hunterkll>  A-KO why tho
[10:29:47] <Hunterkll> you have a gigabyte board
[10:29:50] <Hunterkll> their onboard sucks dick
[10:30:04] <Hunterkll> unlike my asus board which basically has a $200 sound card "onboard"
[10:30:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:31:02] <csws> onboard soundblaster?
[10:31:02] <csws> man
[10:31:09] <Hunterkll> nah
[10:31:14] <Hunterkll> Asus audio
[10:31:18] <csws> unironically never going to buy a gigabyte mobo after the experience with this x570 board
[10:31:22] <Hunterkll> but still, Asus is like the only real competition to soundblaster 
[10:31:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:31:28] <Hunterkll> in the consumer market, for audio
[10:31:29] <A-KO> yeah csws I think I'm done with gigabyte on boards
[10:31:35] <A-KO> at some point I might replace this x570 board with something else
[10:31:37] <csws> A-KO, were you the one I was talking to about the BIOS reset issue?
[10:31:41] <A-KO> yeah prob
[10:31:44] <csws> yeah
[10:31:46] <csws> I thought it was fixed
[10:31:49] <csws> then like 9 months later it reset again
[10:31:51] <A-KO> Hunterkll: apparently the ALC1220 isn't TOO terrible
[10:31:55] <A-KO> csws: What bios you on?
[10:31:57] <csws> latest
[10:32:17] <Hunterkll> A-KO: yea, but that's not the whole thing :P
[10:32:23] <A-KO> csws: I know this sounds dumb as fuck, but I had that issue with incompatible ram configuration. Once I got my ram into a compatible state based on the HCL ; I haven't had that problem
[10:32:26] <Hunterkll> I have an 1220 also 
[10:32:36] <Hunterkll> I also have high end DAC on my board 
[10:32:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:33:02] <A-KO> Hunterkll: well, thing is. I've got shitty 2 channel speakers. Basically they say to drive those it's fine. If I were to go better, I should bother with the speakers first, then upgrade the hardware. Either way, the only real reason I did it was because I was tired of that ugly ass red light in my case
[10:33:05] <Hunterkll> Asus badges it as the SupremeFX 1220, but in the end all 1220's are just rebadged Realtek 1220's
[10:33:14] <csws> A-KO, I thiiiink my RAM was on the HCL but I'll check
[10:33:16] <A-KO> so if I go hardware again I'll get the RGB Soundblaster
[10:33:25] <A-KO> csws: make sure it's on the HCL and in the configuration--it might work for 2 but not 4
[10:33:27] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:33:34] <Hunterkll> probably coulda just unhooked the LED power
[10:33:49] <A-KO> now Gigabyte just needs to get their shit together with their fucking software
[10:33:51] <A-KO> and windows 11
[10:33:55] <Hunterkll> either way, my board is pretty lit
[10:34:00] <Hunterkll> ESS® SABRE9018Q2C dac
[10:34:02] <A-KO> I mean mine's fine, no issues
[10:34:04] <Hunterkll> 8-channel out and shit
[10:34:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:35:52] <Hunterkll> 32-bit 384kHz dac lol
[10:36:05] <Memer> Huh, apparently the mark taskbar entry option just doesn't work as it's presently set up on my PC. Oh well
[10:36:47] <Hunterkll> intel needs to release their new HEDT shit already so i can know what board i'm going to get
[10:36:48] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:37:11] <Memer> Also, ASUS makes some pretty good motherboards 
[10:37:26] <Hunterkll> yea, if you're willing to pay the price
[10:37:27] <A-KO> Intel's not releasing HEDT
[10:37:28] <A-KO> HEDT is dead
[10:37:29] <A-KO> lol
[10:37:33] <Hunterkll> my board was $650-700
[10:37:41] <Hunterkll> HEDT always lags behind like 6mos-1yr mainline parts
[10:37:41] <Memer>  I got a Z490-E for 300 bucks
[10:37:44] <Memer> because sales
[10:38:01] <Hunterkll> AMD says HEDT isn't dead :P
[10:38:07] <csws> A-KO, my wam is not on the HCL
[10:38:11] <Hunterkll>  Memer this is what I have -> https://rog.asus.com/us/motherboards/rog-rampage/rog-rampage-vi-extreme-model/
[10:38:14] <csws> but screw it honestly
[10:38:32] <csws> I wonder if it's somewhat temp related
[10:38:38] <csws> don't have the issue and the moment things warm up.. boom
[10:38:42] <csws> maybe the BIOS is haunted
[10:38:48] <Memer> That might be a little spicier than mine
[10:39:02] <csws> eitherway I'm going to be laptop based soonish so not bothered
[10:39:09] <Hunterkll> A-KO: Intel HEDT should be out around may/june 
[10:39:17] <A-KO> csws: I can definitely say I had that issue with ram not on the HCL
[10:39:20] <A-KO> it was annoying as fuck

[10:40:16] <Memer> I can't advocate for the fact that they decided to make it look like cyberpunk, I just wanted a full ATX and was cool with whatever was good and on sale
[10:40:19] <A-KO> so I might need to fully uninstall and reinstall this driver again
[10:40:24] <A-KO> it worked like one time
[10:40:28] <A-KO> no idea why it aint working now

[10:47:39] <Memer> I think I'll stick with my parts for now, they don't seem to hitch on anything just yet. Although I must admit that I'm starting to run out of patience for my CPU fan.

[10:48:54] <A-KO> I'll futz with the audio app this weekend to get that working
[10:48:57] <Hunterkll> like no shit, the X-series CPUs were always ECC-disabled xeons anyway
[10:48:59] <A-KO> but soundblaster is fully on outta here
[10:49:43] <Hunterkll> wonder if that means they'll leave ECC enabled on these
[10:50:57] <Hunterkll> so instead of calling it HEDT they're calling it "workstation platform"
[10:51:06] <A-KO> makes sense

[10:56:16] <Cl0udNinja> I got a big beefy 120mm cooler on my CPU, and 3 high CFM case fans + the 2 stock ones that came with the case
[10:56:20] <csws> were you going to use it as a trash bin or something? lol
[10:56:28] <Memer> The problem is the space it takes, and how much of a PITA it is to take it out and put it back in lol
[10:56:36] <csws> yeah
[10:56:39] <Cl0udNinja> the cpu cooler is unfortunately like 3mm too tall and makes the window push out at the top a bit
[10:56:42] <csws> for me it has really been set and forget wtih the computer

[10:57:16] <csws> I can't imagine having to work on it at this point. when the BIOS reset and I had to crack it open to deal with the mellanox card, it was dusty like an egyptian tomb in there
[10:57:24] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[10:57:49] <Cl0udNinja> I had to clean mine off a few weeks ago, was like 'why the fuck does the system keep reporting its so hot'
[10:57:58] <Memer> Back when I was budgeting in getting new parts to upgrade once or twice a month or so
[10:58:18] <Cl0udNinja> I did the wild thing and bought everything at once
[10:58:23] <Memer> I ended up deciding I would just wait until I moved lol
[10:58:52] <csws> man everything is just too expensive
[10:59:04] <csws> one of the fans is getting real nasty in the gtx 1080
[10:59:06] <Cl0udNinja> if GPUs werent sky high right now I'd consider upgrading and selling my current one, it does great, but its 100% for the major games I play at the settings I do
[10:59:08] <Memer> Yeah, now's probably the worst time to buy a part
[10:59:15] <Memer> that we've had in a long time lo
[10:59:25] <Memer> I have a perfectly good 1080 TI laying around
[10:59:33] <Memer> Probably should sell it
[10:59:37] <csws> *1 year ago*
[10:59:40] <Cl0udNinja> I've got a radeon RX 5500 XT

[10:59:48] <csws> and welp...
[10:59:52] <Cl0udNinja> yeh
[11:00:01] <Memer> Bought a 2080 TI RIGHT before the shortages
[11:00:01] <Cl0udNinja> not gonna pay 2x+ MSRP for one
[11:00:07] <csws> nice
[11:00:27] <Memer> My buddies gave me a lot of crap when the 30-Series cards came out like a month or 2 after I bought it
[11:01:30] <Memer> I think I made the right decision, being that neither of them got to buy those cards for like a year, and one of their cards failed lol
[11:04:27] <Cl0udNinja> man... this whole surgery fiasco really fucked up my mojo
[11:04:36] <Memer> Eh?
[11:05:02] <Memer> I think I missed that discussion
[11:05:03] <Cl0udNinja> my dog was supposed to have surgery this weekend, I only got a single confirmation, which was actually for the pickup of him, and not drop off, which I never got
[11:05:21] <SirSceptalot> So you need to wait for a new appointment now?
[11:05:27] <Cl0udNinja> so I showed up saturday and they were like 'uhhh you were supposed to pick him up today, the surgery was supposed to be yesterday'
[11:05:29] <Cl0udNinja> yep
[11:05:37] <SirSceptalot> well that sucks balls
[11:05:41] <Memer> +
[11:06:00] <Cl0udNinja> and on top of that, I had scheduled a camping trip before this all got confirmed, which I had cancelled because of the surgery recovery time falling into the same time
[11:06:07] <SirSceptalot> You'd think they'd notice their patient missing, and have the courtesy to call you "yo we can't operate on invisible dogs"
[11:06:22] <csws> wtf
[11:06:32] <Memer> To be fair, by the time they noticed he was late, they'd probably not have time to operate on the dog by the time they got there
[11:06:34] <Cl0udNinja> heh yeah, idk whats up with that. they're usually pretty on the spot with that kinda shit, but they didnt
[11:07:02] <Cl0udNinja> but yeah not having the surgery fucked me over just as much as having it
[11:07:14] <Cl0udNinja> all the prep work I did on friday now worthless
[11:07:44] <SirSceptalot> plus your dog is still not fixed
[11:07:58] <Cl0udNinja> in case anything went wrong I made sure that he had a great day the day before, we went for a good drive, a long walk, I made him steak and carrots
[11:08:00] <SirSceptalot> hope he's not in much pain because of it
[11:08:01] <Cl0udNinja> yeah that too
[11:08:23] <Cl0udNinja> not too terrible, but its definitely still visible pain
[11:08:45] <SirSceptalot> well what you did wasn't worthless, a good time is a good time for him
[11:08:54] <SirSceptalot> but I get what you mean
[11:09:05] <Cl0udNinja> yeah true, but like I took time off and shit
[11:09:35] <Cl0udNinja> they were supposed to call me today and didnt
[11:09:44] <Cl0udNinja> now I suspect I wont hear from them until next week thanks to holidays
[11:10:18] <SirSceptalot> not to be a dick about it but can't you just call them instead?
[11:10:30] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I'm gonna call them tomorrow but they said saturday they would call me
[11:10:50] <Cl0udNinja> this really fucks shit up because I was planning a road trip to go see a friend for my birthday because the recovery time would be up right in time for him to be cool runnin around
[11:11:14] <SirSceptalot> it's past business hours now where you are?
[11:11:19] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[11:11:22] <Cl0udNinja> its almost midnight here lol
[11:11:30] <Memer> Almost 2 AM here
[11:11:35] <SirSceptalot> lol, that counts as past business hours I'd say
[11:12:18] <Cl0udNinja> I'm gonna call them tomorrow, but like, either I'm gonna miss all the shit I had planned, or the surgery is gonna be pushed until like, Feb
[11:12:33] <Memer> Can I ask what the surgery is for?
[11:12:50] <Cl0udNinja> his knee, they're basically gonna 'reposition' his leg's stance
[11:13:12] <Memer> Gotcha
[11:14:02] <SirSceptalot> who knows, if you explain the road trip business they might try to squeeze you in somewhere
[11:14:19] <Cl0udNinja> they'd basically have to do it tomorrow...
[11:14:22] <SirSceptalot> I mean, seems like it's not unfeasable that there's a no-show somewhere, right? :p

[11:15:45] <Cl0udNinja> theres no way I'd be able to make it happen, my birthday is near end of january, and I was planning like a 2+ week road trip
[11:16:16] <Cl0udNinja> even if they did it tomorrow he'd still be in recovery time by the time we're supposed to leave
[11:17:14] <SirSceptalot> recovery = immobilized?
[11:18:08] <Cl0udNinja> no, but he needs to be able to stretch out and not be restricted to the confines of the backseat for a long number of hours
[11:18:15] <SirSceptalot> ah
[11:18:55] <Cl0udNinja> the first month is the hardest, but after that its basically 'no wild shit' for the second month, but also means he still has to be fairly comfortable and careful
[11:20:45] <Cl0udNinja> I'm just more irritated than anything because I'd planned and canceled so much shit surrounding this surgery that its now all for naught
[11:20:46] <SirSceptalot> well all in all though, IF they operate tomorrow that's 2 or 3 days difference. It's leg recovery, not RAID recovery.
[11:20:57] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[11:21:07] <Memer> That's kind of what I was thinking
[11:21:17] <SirSceptalot> it's not like at the end of the recovery period, he's 100% fine but 3 days earlier his leg is useless
[11:21:23] <Memer> What the functional difference of 1-2 days is, in that context

[11:44:14] <Memer> yep it now tastes like garlic drink

[11:44:48] <Cl0udNinja> I mean, I can only get angry about the movie I'm watchin right?
[11:45:04] <lancehead> Fair fair 
[11:45:12] <Cl0udNinja> I watched T1 last night, and been watchin the others throughout the day/evening, and now I'm on Genesys
[11:45:15] <SirSceptalot> lancehead, yeah I get why you're tired now :p
[11:45:24] <Cl0udNinja> but hes all like 'oh we gotta send someone back who wants to go'
[11:45:34] <Cl0udNinja> MOTHERFUCKER WHY YOU EVEN ASKIN, YOU KNOW WHOS GOIN
[11:46:01] <Memer> So here's a question
[11:46:39] <Memer> At what point does drinking straight vodka stop just giving me the flavor of distilled disgust and start giving me the "subtle flavors" they're supposed to have
[11:46:51] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@46.105.34.51) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:47:00] <Cl0udNinja> never
[11:47:07] <SirSceptalot> I never figured that out either
[11:47:12] <Memer> I have a buddy who swears they can taste the nuances or whatnot in the drink, to me I'm just like "ah yes, this one tastes less like gasoline than the other I guess"
[11:47:21] <Cl0udNinja> actually like most other drinks you're supposed to dilute it a bit
[11:47:36] <Memer> I can do shots of rum just fine though
[11:47:37] <Cl0udNinja> like when you have whiskey you're supposed to either put a finger drop or two of water, or an ice cube
[11:47:44] <Cl0udNinja> which causes the finer flavors to appear
[11:47:48] <Memer> Huh, that's actually interesting
[11:47:49] <Cl0udNinja> rum also works like that
[11:47:59] *** Joins: fcinq (~irc@46.105.34.51)
[11:48:12] <SirSceptalot> I should actually try that too, but I'm sure I wouldn't taste the difference
[11:48:14] <Memer> Whenever I'd have my drinking games with friends, I'd always break out whatever rum was around
[11:48:22] <Memer> ended up being appleton estate usually
[11:48:25] <Cl0udNinja> for the 'finger of water' method, you just get some cold water, dip your finger in it, and then dip the drop into the drink
[11:48:35] <Cl0udNinja> RUM IS GREAT, RUM IS GREAT
[11:48:38] * Cl0udNinja does a little dance
[11:48:50] <Cl0udNinja> I'm drinkin on some Doorlys 8 year old rum atm
[11:48:53] <Memer> I had some spiced rum my family brought back from jamaica at one point too, not sure if I still have it though
[11:49:22] <Memer> Rum is great.
[11:49:26] <Cl0udNinja> I've come to like Barbados style rums, which is disappointing because of all the problems Barbados has
[11:49:41] <Memer> Ooh, here's one I'm not sure anyone here will have tried
[11:49:46] <Memer> Anyone else here go for mead?
[11:49:56] <SirSceptalot> I feel like I'm shit when it comes to tasting stuff like that. Like with wine too, people are like "a hint of chocolate and vanilla, and... ah yes, a ladybug lost his virginity on one of the grapes in this bottle
[11:50:00] <Cl0udNinja> OH MAN DID WE JUST BECOME FRIENDS
[11:50:04] <Cl0udNinja> RUM AND MEAD?!?!
[11:50:05] <SirSceptalot> me: I think this is red wine
[11:50:16] <Memer> I've only ever had a few types, all from Havok or Groennfell
[11:50:31] <Memer> But I have a different bottle in the cabinet I got as a gift that I'm breaking out soon,

[11:51:43] <Memer> Uhm
[11:51:52] <Memer> I think that's the brand I have, but a different variety actually LOL
[11:52:06] <Cl0udNinja> I like their other one that comes in the tan bottle
[11:52:08] <Memer> Cl0udNinja This is what my family got me: https://www.totalwine.com/wine/dessert-fortified-wine/mead/dansk-mjod-viking-blod-mead/p/115959750?s=1902&igrules=true
[11:52:49] <Cl0udNinja> how is that one? I've been on the fence about tryin that one
[11:52:57] <Memer> I'll tell ya once I've had it lol
[11:53:05] <Cl0udNinja> haha
[11:53:07] <SirSceptalot> that klapojster is some good stuff :)
[11:53:10] <Memer> I wanted to clear out all the Groennfell before I put it in the fridge
[11:53:10] <Cl0udNinja> I like their stuff though
[11:53:24] <Cl0udNinja> my other favorite mead is Chauncers, good for a cheap mead

[11:53:56] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, thats the same one I linked, just a different bottle
[11:54:23] <Cl0udNinja> I'll have to find the name of the other one that I grab occasionally from them, but its the same bottle as the one you linked but not the same name/label
[11:54:54] <Memer> this one?

[11:55:07] <Cl0udNinja> nope
[11:55:11] <Cl0udNinja> I cant remember which one it is
[11:55:16] <Memer> Ahh, fair
[11:55:27] <Cl0udNinja> its not listed there strangely
[11:56:39] <Memer> One of these days I'm going to have to try out these bloody mary 'variants'
[11:56:47] <Cl0udNinja> as for Rum, my tops are: Pyrat, Montanya, Doorlys 8 yr, Mount Gay XO triple cask
[11:56:57] <Memer> Found out you can make 'em with stuff other than vodka, and it gives 'em different names
[11:57:27] <Memer> Haven't heard of those before actually, I'll have to look them up
[11:57:33] <Cl0udNinja> oh and also Pompenaro, but thats on the spendy side
[11:58:13] <Memer> I need to find some drinking buddies around town lol
[11:58:36] <Memer> so much more fun when everyone gets fucked up
[11:58:38] <Cl0udNinja> pf, I'd rather just drink at home with some good people on steam lol
[11:58:56] <Cl0udNinja> and theres always the good old fashioned Diablo 2 drinking game
[11:58:58] <Memer> I mean, that's fun too. But I just like the vibe of being at the bar
[11:59:10] <Memer> Makes shots more fun, and more likely
[11:59:11] <Cl0udNinja> I dont miss that at all tbh
[11:59:34] <Memer> Well, I specifically liked going to the bar after work with my old coworkers
[11:59:45] <Cl0udNinja> parts of it I miss, because I met some good people there, but like cost to get fucked up is waay more than being at home lol
[11:59:46] <Memer> as a bigger group
[12:00:09] <Memer> Place we went to did of course cost more than at home, but it wasn't that pricey all things considered
[12:00:17] <Cl0udNinja> I can get trashed for more than a week for what I'd spend on a day/night at the bar
[12:00:40] <Memer> I'm lucky on one thing
[12:00:55] <Memer> It doesn't take too much for me to get a buzz, but I can also hold a fair bit
[12:01:03] <Memer> so I can kinda pay what I want
[12:01:31] <Memer> Only ever been full blackout once
[12:01:50] <Cl0udNinja> I can definitely say theres been more than one
[12:02:14] <Memer> The only way I knew that it happened, is I woke up in the morning and found things out of place
[12:02:17] <Cl0udNinja> theres the incident in which I saw my gf/fiance kissing some other dude on new years, and instead of confronting, I decided to drink more until I didnt care
[12:02:49] <Cl0udNinja> theres the incident in which I said I could totally keep pace with this girl I was tryin to bang, only to puke, rip the towel bar off the wall and wake up with my pants unzipped wondering if we fucked
[12:02:53] <DrZak> she was just friendly
[12:02:54] <DrZak> :)
[12:03:46] <Memer> Your life seems a lot more interesting than mine
[12:03:46] <Cl0udNinja> theres also the incident in which I kept drinking to forget this bitch was bein an attention ho, to the point of fuckin her and getting alcohol poisoning 
[12:04:00] <Memer> Yep, definitely so
[12:04:03] <DrZak> yolo

[13:21:26] <SirSceptalot> people, as in regular users? Why would you not want them to help themselves? (Assuming they can without being local admin)
[13:21:31] <Memer> Oh no, people as in our helpdesk
[13:22:03] <Activ8> a team is a team for a reason - you try to guide your team mates unless they are asking stupid questions 
[13:22:11] <Memer> But it was faster to fix the issue than assign out a ticket
[13:22:13] <Activ8> e.g fix is very easy 
[13:22:29] <Memer> and for every ticket we assigned out, we got more escalation calls
[13:22:42] <teh_f4ll3n> my last job was ISP tech support. We were highly discouraged to spend more than 10 minutes on a call, but if the same customer called back within 7 day for whatever reason, it went against your stats
[13:23:04] <Memer> I think that standard is awful.
[13:23:16] <teh_f4ll3n> Don't work for Indian tech support sweatshops, guys

[13:24:02] <Memer> That's fair lol
[13:24:03] <SirSceptalot> it's not funny, but I think it's something worth saving
[13:24:23] <Memer> I don't really do company loyalty as a result of that philosophy
[13:24:29] <teh_f4ll3n> no one's ever going t care about you more than you
[13:25:01] <Activ8> How's anyone supposed to learn how to fix a problem if they're told to just make someone else do it? - that's usually what training is for
[13:25:16] <Activ8> you supposed to learn in training how things are fixed but there is no problem with still asking for help
[13:25:24] <Memer> Oh, I should have been more specific.
[13:25:32] <teh_f4ll3n> Activ8, it's all about numbers
[13:25:36] <Memer> "If they're told never to learn it, and instead leave it as someone else's problem"
[13:25:49] <Activ8> ofc
[13:26:01] <Memer> The helpdesk game is a game of ticket numbers nowadays, resolution metrics are almost useless
[13:26:19] <teh_f4ll3n> fax ^^
[13:26:36] <Activ8> metrics pisses me off so much
[13:26:39] <rpifan> german govt still loves the fax
[13:26:45] <rpifan> and apparently its also common in japan
[13:26:47] <Memer> That's my issue that I'm taking up - I'm sorry if I was unclear
[13:26:53] <Activ8> as soon as some company implements metrics you get people fighting to close tickets
[13:27:17] <Memer> I feel like if someone completes 30 tickets less, but resolves 20 more issues, they shouldn't be treated as less valuable assuming they're still meeting requirements
[13:27:24] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> that's what you get when managers eat up "you can't manage what you can't measure" bullshit

[13:28:41] <Activ8> one of my fav words in tech lol - aka the shit show ha ha
[13:29:06] <Memer> I will say that I totally stand for ticket and document everything
[13:29:36] <Memer> Although I also stand for "password resets should have a template and require almost no special input"
[13:29:39] <Activ8> documentation goes inside a ticket usually, or the external url where the documentation is

[13:30:15] <Memer> I might've mentioned before, but I often learn more from searching through desktop support's resolution notes on tickets than I do from KBs

[13:42:55] <SirSceptalot> obviously, you need to have one, but they'll go for less than a car
[13:42:57] <rpifan> but i lived in large cities

[13:43:02] <rpifan> but not always easy

[13:47:48] <Memer> (And I might have made things sound worse off regarding the 'technically alive' parent thing - we're on good terms and they're healthy, but he has another family to take care of, and I don't want to detract from that)
[13:49:41] <Activ8> confluence won't work we have more than 10 techs, therefore we will end up paying and as it stands we don't pay

[14:39:18] <Hunterkll> uhm
[14:39:18] <rpifan> boss wants a presentation explaining how much intune costs and why we need it
[14:39:20] <Hunterkll> actually you do 
[14:39:47] <Hunterkll> if you're paying for azure/O365 via credit card/whatever
[14:40:02] <Activ8> ffs a presentation pusher
[14:40:07] <Activ8> bet he loves stats too
[14:40:14] <rpifan> well the internets were saying you should go thru a reseller
[14:40:24] <Hunterkll> i mean you can
[14:40:25] <rpifan> Activ8, well its a woman and its the HR manager. My boss is the HR person
[14:40:28] <rpifan> so a non techincal user
[14:40:39] <Activ8> oh my gosh even worse lol
[14:40:45] <Hunterkll> really depends on license count
[14:40:49] <Hunterkll> and you'll often pay more overall 
[14:40:54] <Hunterkll> but they'll handhold you and help support it
[14:40:57] <Hunterkll> but if you go through a CSP 
[14:41:02] <Hunterkll> you can't open microsoft tickets directly
[14:41:05] <Hunterkll> the CSP has to open them for you
[14:41:15] <Hunterkll> (hence it costing more than buying your own licensing - you're also buying support from said CSP)
[14:41:49] <Activ8> I'm surprised you haven't made a decision already

[14:42:20] <Hunterkll> but yes, it really is that simple
[14:42:38] <rpifan> thanks for that slide
[14:42:41] <rpifan> ill add it to the presentation
[14:42:44] <Hunterkll> i'd also recommend you get the EMS E3 suite instead of just intune
[14:42:50] <Hunterkll> intune starts at $8/user/mo
[14:42:57] <Hunterkll> EMS E3 is $10.60/user/month 
[14:43:07] <rpifan> yea what is this e3 thing, i didnt find a simplified description
[14:43:10] <Joe_Developer> I'm alive
[14:43:20] <Joe_Developer> oh god licensing I'm leaving now
[14:43:24] <Activ8> lmao
[14:43:27] *** Joe_Developer is now known as Joe-Developer
[14:43:31] <Hunterkll> but includes Azure AD P1, Advanced Threat Analytics, Intune, and Azure Information Protection P1 
[14:43:35] <Joe-Developer> we've had a right fuck on with ours
[14:43:45] <Hunterkll> rpifan: it's just a bundle of a bunch of stuff instead of just intune
[14:44:05] <rpifan> well ive been told it seems likely we will transition over to macs in the next few months
[14:44:16] <Hunterkll> rpifan: you'll need at least Intune + AAD P1 for what you want, and that'll cost more than EMS E3 does if you buy the licenses standalone
[14:44:20] <rpifan> so this intune thing will be temporary and we will move over to jamf slowly i suspect
[14:44:21] <Hunterkll> and you also need it for the MFA support
[14:44:55] <Hunterkll> you'll want intune to light up a bunch of SSO / login scenarios and other stuff, we use intune in conjunction with jamf 
[14:45:09] <Haise0> EMS E3 can integrate with O365 or there is separate package that unifies them both ?
[14:45:18] <Hunterkll> wut
[14:45:24] <Hunterkll> ?

[14:45:51] <rpifan> either way we are likely to go almost entirely remote in the next few weeks
[14:45:53] <Hunterkll> it's just an other license in your account...
[14:45:56] <rpifan> and we need some kind of solution atm
[14:46:02] <rpifan> since we have no management of user laptops atm
[14:46:14] <Hunterkll> intune is going to get you there ASAP 
[14:46:21] <Hunterkll> and buy you time to figure out wh at you want later
[14:46:22] <Haise0> Hunterkll: I'm asking if you want to have O365 license and EMS E3 license, do you have to buy both separately or MS can sell them in single package ?
[14:46:25] <Hunterkll> you can start month-to-month 
[14:46:29] <rpifan> so what is this about assinging licenses 
[14:46:31] <Hunterkll> Haise0: there's bundles, yes 
[14:46:34] <rpifan> why do you only have 5 
[14:46:45] <Hunterkll> rpifan: because that's what my package plan gets me
[14:46:48] <Hunterkll> that's my personal tenant
[14:46:51] <rpifan> ah
[14:47:18] <rpifan> maybe since you are here you can help me figure out why i keep getting a no permission page everytime i try to look at intune and the tenant status
[14:47:22] <rpifan> im the top admin already

[14:48:04] <Hunterkll> but yea you just turn on/off what licenses y ou need per u ser out of the bucket you buy
[14:48:37] <rpifan> i think we have like 200 laptops
[14:49:02] <Hunterkll> so you're looking at a ballpark around $2k/mo expense 
[14:49:15] <Haise0> Seventh Astral Era quests are fucking draining me, I can't wait to get into Heavensward and later expansions 
[14:50:39] <Hunterkll> rpifan: and double that to add JAMF cloud-based 
[14:51:02] <Hunterkll> long and short of it is you'll eevntually be around $4k/mo 
[14:51:09] <Hunterkll> all said and don e
[14:51:23] <Hunterkll> that'll cover you for windows, mac, linux, android, iOS, etc
[14:52:15] <Hunterkll> its like $7/mo for JAMF Pro per device, then another $24/yr for JAMF connect on top of that
[14:52:40] <Hunterkll> eventually you'll only have to manage accounts through Azure if you go this route, and they'll propagate to everything else you use/do
[14:53:15] <rpifan> well remember the company people really want us to manage stuff thru gsuite
[14:53:54] <Hunterkll> it doesn't really matter where the accounts come from, but if you go the azure route, then things like SSO to all your SaaS apps will be far easier, BYOD/MDM will be integrated, etc
[14:54:02] <Hunterkll> and the g suite angle will be covered too
[14:54:10] <Hunterkll> and you'll have centrally managed MFA for *all* your devices, etc
[14:54:25] <Hunterkll> using G Suite as the 'source of truth' so to speak for your accounts will make life far more difficult 
[14:54:37] <rpifan> yea i understand Hunterkll but thats what the people wnat
[14:54:40] <yuken> Hunterkll, you want 1000 bags of flamin' hot doritos?
[14:54:41] <rpifan> g suite as the source of truth
[14:55:00] <Hunterkll> you just need to explain the technical benefits/drawbacks
[14:55:19] <Hunterkll> basically "Yes, we can do that, but it will cost is $X more and create Y management hurdles/problems that we will have to use 3rd party products to resolve"
[14:55:37] <rpifan> so gsuite does not integrate easily into jamf and the like?
[14:55:42] <rpifan> rmemeber the idea is to get rid of the mac laptops
[14:55:50] <rpifan> i mean the windows laptops
[14:56:01] <SirSceptalot> no you said it, no backsies
[14:56:09] <Hunterkll> doesn't matter
[14:56:16] <Hunterkll> i'm not even considering the laptops themselves in this equation
[14:57:27] <Hunterkll> basically - if you go the g suite route, yes, you can even SAML into Azure AD, but....
[14:57:39] <Hunterkll> then device management/BYOD etc will become a hassle
[14:57:51] <Hunterkll> and if you use intune licenses for BYOD, you're licensing per user - cost savings there 
[14:57:57] <Hunterkll> with JAMF you have to pay per-managed device
[14:58:03] <Hunterkll> so every enrolled ipad/phone/mac/etc
[14:58:12] <Hunterkll> whereas with intune, you just license it based on actual named user
[14:58:25] <Hunterkll> and if you go the intune route, you're going to be doing AAD accounts *anyay*
[14:58:35] <mjt> CALs are such a rort
[14:58:45] <Hunterkll> this literally has nothing to do with CALs
[14:58:46] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:58:53] <mjt> Equivalent concept 
[14:58:58] <mjt> User/device licencing
[14:59:19] <Hunterkll> right, but this isn't charging for access to a system you're running in house
[14:59:28] <Hunterkll> this is just like any other SaaS software product 
[15:01:04] <Hunterkll> there's no "Buy this license, then buy X Y Z license to allow access" - just a flat, per-user rate
[15:01:48] <Hunterkll> rpifan: and in reality here, when we're talking about JAMF - the benefit you'd be getting out of JAMF is ...... account integration with AAD so you can use the AAD account to log into the mac and set up MFA etc on the logins
[15:02:01] <Hunterkll> rpifan: if you just stick with local accounts on managed machines, then you don't need JAMF at all
[15:02:03] <rpifan> can jamf do account integration with gsuite
[15:02:49] <Hunterkll> it can, but .... it's going to make the rest of your life ugly
[15:03:12] <Hunterkll> just from the limitations of how/why g suite is built and designed
[15:03:19] <rpifan> how come. assuming we eliminate the windows latops soon 
[15:03:38] <Hunterkll> at that point i'd give up trying to do centralized accounts and anything else and just accept that you're going to be managing a bunch of different services independently 
[15:03:59] <Hunterkll> or switch everyone over to chromebooks
[15:04:00] <xe0n> loll
[15:04:00] <Hunterkll> :D
[15:04:58] <Hunterkll> rpifan: point mainly being, G Suite as an identity provider is like a bolted on after thought, AAD is designed from the ground up specifically for this purpose
[15:05:01] <Hunterkll> regardless of OS you're using
[15:05:08] <Hunterkll> fuck for all AAD cares you could be using linux
[15:05:42] <rpifan> right AAD is the identity provider and then everything else can read from that
[15:05:44] <mjt> Hunterkll: are you speaking from the sysadmin perspective? In my experience g suite is vastly superior to aad from the end user perspective
[15:05:46] <rpifan> but Gsuite is not meant to do that
[15:06:02] <mjt> Aad is awful particularly for employees with accounts from multiple organisations
[15:06:07] <Hunterkll> mjt: both - the only way a user should even know it's Azure AD is if they recognize the setup dialogs 
[15:06:28] <Hunterkll> or check the URLs for web app signin stuff
[15:06:29] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:06:46] <Hunterkll> ours is fully customized, so really the only telling factor is that we ask you toinstall the microsoft authenticator app
[15:06:46] <Hunterkll> :P

[15:22:23] <Hunterkll> going "DONT VIRTUALIZE DCS EVER!!!" Is dumb if it's for a SMB scenario 
[15:22:39] <Hunterkll> whereas in my case, i'm worried about nation-state level actors
[15:22:44] *** Quits: rpifan (~rpifan___@user/rpifan) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:22:46] <Hunterkll> and then there's a whole host of in between levels too
[15:23:05] <Hunterkll> like, with virtual DCs, you have to - from a security perspective - consider your hypervisor admins, storage admins, etc as essentially being domain admins
[15:23:26] <Hunterkll> because there's so many ways they can lever themselves up to DA by fucking with the VMs 
[15:23:49] <Hunterkll> hence the idea of if you're gonna virtualize, a DC-only cluster run by the DAs 
[15:23:58] <Hunterkll> benefits of virtualization, but still keeping that security/role separation 
[15:24:25] <xe0n> forza 5 is sweet
[15:24:39] <sd> 13<C​olour> They got 2 physical DCs and a few virtual but they mentioned updating the physical DCs to newer hardware and I felt like there was no need to dedicate a whole physical box to something like that.
[15:24:39] <sd> 13<C​olour> 
[15:24:39] <sd> 13<C​olour> Small company so not many IT people, but it's all locked off so only we can access most servers. The current physical servers are more physically accessible right now though.
[15:24:42] <Hunterkll> then you get into things like, even exchange, etc, where you want to make sure you have w rite caching disabled on your storage/storage controllers, etc 
[15:24:47] <mjt> xe0n: Forza 5 has inconsistencies
[15:24:55] <mjt> (I'm joking)
[15:25:13] <Hunterkll> I mean, personally, I like to have one or two physical DCs just from an oh-shit perspective of bringing stuff back up in a DR scenario
[15:25:18] <Hunterkll> ignoring all the security concerns, etc
[15:26:08] <mjt> in the early 2000s we did a weekly backup of the dc to tape and had the security guard take it offsite at the end of the day
[15:26:13] <mjt> Unencrypted
[15:26:21] <mjt> So he was basically a DA
[15:26:23] <pcspkr> yea if the virtualization shits the bed
[15:26:46] <pcspkr> ideally you would want a physical dc or one running under a different hypervisor
[15:26:54] <xe0n> DIFFERENT LOL
[15:27:07] <xe0n> i'd be more concerned your DR plan failed
[15:27:10] <pcspkr> xe0n: directly mentioned in microsoft best practice documentation
[15:27:27] <Hunterkll> note they're talking about different physical virtualization box
[15:27:32] <xe0n> ^
[15:27:33] <Hunterkll> not necessarily a different brand/type of hypervisor
[15:27:36] <xe0n> ^
[15:27:46] <pcspkr> nope
[15:27:46] <Hunterkll> so a 2-node hyper-v cluster fits that requirement, as does a 2-node vsphere cluster, etc
[15:28:04] <mjt> Is the hyper V hypervisor powering the domain controller meant to be joined to the domain?
[15:28:11] <Hunterkll> Run at least two virtualized domain controllers per domain on different virtualization hosts, which reduces the risk of losing all domain controllers if a single virtualization host fails.
[15:28:12] <xe0n> shit yes
[15:28:39] <Hunterkll> mjt: yea they should all be domain joined for normal login/admin tasks 
[15:28:56] <Hunterkll> mjt: worst case scenario - just like with esxi - you use the local administrator account to log in and start up/fix the VM issue 
[15:29:05] <mjt> does that not pose a chicken and the egg problem, or can a local adm... Never mind you said that
[15:29:12] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:29:23] <Hunterkll> mjt: also, set your DC VMs to auto-start after X seconds post-system boot
[15:29:25] <yuken> pog. All the items for my vape arrive today except the actual cartridges.
[15:29:29] <yuken> I just need to solder shit now.
[15:29:41] <csws> lol
[15:29:47] <pcspkr> oh it's actually stated this way
[15:29:47] <csws> we had a fuckup today at work
[15:29:50] <Hunterkll> mjt: but again, that's why I said I like to have a physical DC or two regardless of anything else - even in non-hyper-v environments, li ke vmware that's using domain auth 
[15:29:52] <csws> brownout and the UPS failed to transfer
[15:29:57] <csws> RIP the datacentre
[15:29:57] <pcspkr> 4. Maintain physical domain controllers in each of your domains. This mitigates the risk of a virtualization platform malfunction that affects all host systems that use that platform.
[15:30:14] <Hunterkll> right
[15:30:23] <Hunterkll> but the first point is basically "dont fucking put all your DCs on one physical host"
[15:30:28] <xe0n> ...thats keep a physical dc box
[15:30:34] <xe0n> and have more than one host..
[15:30:34] <xe0n> lol
[15:30:45] <csws> whycome a physical DC
[15:30:57] <pcspkr> but if you were to virtualize everything, one way to mitigate the risk would be to run different hypervisors
[15:31:11] <Hunterkll> sure
[15:31:19] <pcspkr> of course it also "doubles" the attack surface via hypervisors
[15:31:21] <Hunterkll> that'd also "solve" the issue 
[15:31:34] <Hunterkll> or you can just get a fuckin dell R640 for $500 and run it as a DC
[15:31:35] <Hunterkll> lol

[15:32:04] <pcspkr> virtualizing can have benefits tho
[15:32:18] <pcspkr> easier to migrate and upgrade
[15:32:18] <csws> better for like 99% of things
[15:32:36] <Hunterkll> sure, but having a physical box that you can tell someone to check the lights on is useful too
[15:32:36] <csws> live migrations, much easier HA, much easier backups and restores

[17:04:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[17:04:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> cheapeast option for what Telgareith
[17:04:09] <Telgareith> what?
[17:04:23] <Telgareith> I think I'm on E1 or E0?
[17:04:33] <Telgareith> the basic just email plan
[17:05:26] <Hunterkll> uh
[17:05:32] <Hunterkll> if all you want is email, EOP1 is $4/user/month
[17:05:43] <Telgareith> that's what I'm paying
[17:06:15] <Telgareith> I was wondering if there was a cheaper way
[17:06:22] <Hunterkll> eh well
[17:06:24] <Hunterkll> let's see
[17:06:28] <Hunterkll> 3 accounts you're paying for?
[17:06:33] <Telgareith> 2 or 3
[17:06:42] <Hunterkll> anything else you might want/need to use?
[17:06:52] <SupremePizza> thought EOP was only mail filtering
[17:07:17] <Telgareith> not most the 365 sttuff, but AAD and azure
[17:07:39] <Hunterkll> SupremePizza: there's exchange online protection, then exchange online plan 1/2 :P
[17:07:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:07:45] <Hunterkll> not confusing at all
[17:08:10] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: well, here's the gist of it - i pay $475/yr to MS, and in return i get a giant bucketload of shit
[17:08:22] <Hunterkll> was trying to think of if that'd be worthwhile for you or not
[17:08:29] <Telgareith> nope
[17:08:35] <Hunterkll> that $475/yr gives me $100/month in azure credit, just to start off
[17:08:52] <Telgareith> work might pay  for me to have VS2022 pro sub though
[17:09:03] <Hunterkll> 5x O365 E3, 5x EMS E3, 10x Win enterprise, win server, exchange, sharepoint, 3x visual studio pro subscriptions, etc

[17:09:38] <SupremePizza> FSM Bless the Action Pack
[17:09:54] <Hunterkll> that 10 support incidents is 10x of the $499/incident pro support 
[17:10:18] *** Quits: arlion (~arlion@user/arlion) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:10:31] <Hunterkll> so it's actually cheaper than a standalone VS Pro sub
[17:10:40] <Telgareith> yea
[17:10:44] <Hunterkll> and includes all the on-prem software that the cheaper version sub includes
[17:10:49] <SupremePizza> gotta be an ms partner though
[17:10:53] *** Joins: arlion (~arlion@user/arlion)

[17:11:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:11:10] <Telgareith> well it has partner in the URL so I assume so
[17:11:28] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: sole proprietorship qualifies
[17:11:29] <Hunterkll> :P
[17:11:35] <Hunterkll> aka "yea it just me validate me already"
[17:11:37] <Telgareith> I've got that

[17:12:23] <Telgareith> thanks
[17:12:36] <Hunterkll> you'll get a call from D&B going "yea is this really you? ok cool thx"
[17:12:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:12:56] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: me and A-KO split an action pack, xe0n has one for himself, etc
[17:13:00] <Hunterkll> its a pretty fuckin sweet deal
[17:13:09] <Telgareith> yea it fucking is
[17:13:14] <SupremePizza> action pack has always been amazing
[17:13:21] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: especially since all the licenses are PUR - PRODUCTION USE RIGHTS 
[17:13:31] <Hunterkll> aka that win serv standard license? you can use that for work/business
[17:13:38] <Hunterkll> not MSDN / VS test/dev only restricted
[17:13:41] <SupremePizza> back in the day when installs were on discs you would get a binder full of everything
[17:13:45] <Hunterkll> same with the sharepoint, exchange, etc licenses
[17:13:52] <SupremePizza> like 200 discs
[17:13:59] <Telgareith> wait, its a MSDN license too?
[17:14:10] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: you get included 3x Visual Studio pro subscriptions
[17:14:38] <Hunterkll> without the monthly azure credits, of course, but you get $100/mo just for having MAPS so that kinda makes up for it
[17:15:15] <Telgareith> anybody want to split one with me XD
[17:15:47] <Hunterkll> loool
[17:15:57] <Hunterkll> i just give a-ko access to cut down my cost, but i had it regardless
[17:16:49] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: but yea, it's vs pro with the software downloads, so not the cheesy $500 subscription :p
[17:17:03] <yuken> Hunterkll, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NduFgQySoFM
[17:17:32] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: it's 3x of the $1,200/yr subscription 
[17:17:48] <Telgareith> damn
[17:18:17] <Hunterkll> like i said, some shit is cut out - like the azure credit per-account (since you already get azure credit) and some lengthier trials like EMS E5
[17:18:22] <Hunterkll> but the tradeoffs are fully worth it

[17:21:30] <Telgareith> I've got a permanent vs2019 enterprise license atm
[17:21:34] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: not sure if you can download this link, but https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-action-pack-license-table.pdf
[17:21:48] <Hunterkll> that shows you the license grants in that $475/yr payment
[17:22:11] <Hunterkll> note that except for the VS Pro subs, ALL OF THAT IS PRODUCTION USE LICENSED
[17:22:33] <Hunterkll> it's basically a cheat code to small business licensing
[17:23:10] <Hunterkll> and yes, that is *10* licenses of Office 2019 Pro Plus (well, 2022 now, but w/e)
[17:23:27] <Telgareith> can you add it to an existing tenant?
[17:23:33] <Hunterkll> erm

[17:38:35] <Telgareith> k
[17:38:39] <Hunterkll> and it adds a 1 year long bucket of licenses
[17:38:46] <sintax> fritzwastaken: morning. how's the office settling going?
[17:38:54] <Hunterkll> so you get a 1-year long 5 license key for each entitlemenet
[17:38:55] <CptLuxx> unless your an idiot and justt add more licences instead of extending

[17:48:30] <vinrock> shuckin' and drivin'
[17:48:48] <SupremePizza> All you can get from the backblaze data is if a specific model has higher failure rate or not
[17:48:57] <SupremePizza> you can't say that seagate is better or whatever from their data
[17:49:04] <Hunterkll> we're not saying that
[17:49:10] <Hunterkll> we're saying failure rates are inline with industry norms
[17:49:10] <teh_f4ll3n> vinrock, why did that bring on the singing yoda image?
[17:49:12] <Hunterkll> that's all

[17:51:03] <Telgareith> only $600 each... that's actually amazing

[17:58:16] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: vendor/supplier means you're shipping *to* ingram

[17:59:30] <Hunterkll> make sure you have your sales tax certificate info handy if you're doing that now

[18:01:22] <Telgareith> ok
[18:01:28] <Telgareith> how does this sales tax thing work
[18:02:29] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its VAT
[18:02:45] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but unlike in uk they dont list sales tax inc the price for retail
[18:02:51] <Hunterkll> .....
[18:03:02] <sd> 11<H​otmess> essentially everything you see is exVAT like its for buiness
[18:03:15] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: anyway, ignoring that - basically, you aren't paying sales tax when you order from ingram. you have to charge the end customer sales tax and remit that to the state yourself
[18:03:23] <Telgareith> yea
[18:03:28] <Telgareith> but if I'm consuming it?
[18:03:30] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah VAT, vaule added tax
[18:03:31] <Hunterkll> erm
[18:03:36] <Hunterkll> well you're not supposed to do taht
[18:03:37] <Hunterkll> :P
[18:03:38] <Hunterkll> but well
[18:03:42] <Hunterkll> call it unsold stock and move on
[18:03:43] <Hunterkll> :D

[18:03:59] <Hunterkll> another expense to write down on your balance sheets
[18:04:12] <Hunterkll> yer LLC paid for it, but didn't sell it... yet.... 
[18:04:37] <Telgareith> of course by the time I sell it, it's depreciated :P
[18:04:49] <Hunterkll> technically speaking you're supposed to remit the sales tax on it yourself 
[18:04:54] <Hunterkll> if you're buying it for the company to use 
[18:05:07] <Hunterkll> buuuut...... that's not the distro's job to keep up on

[18:08:02] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: erm, they're still up, if you're talking about the old versions, they gave every licensed customer offline activation keys 
[18:08:03] <PublicWiFi> so much snot is coming out of my body, how is this possible
[18:08:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:08:05] <Telgareith> but I can't activate it
[18:08:17] <Telgareith> where can I find said keys?
[18:08:35] <Hunterkll> usually in your adobe account you associated the key with 
[18:08:55] <SupremePizza> publicwifi you got the corona?
[18:09:15] <Hunterkll> this was rather famous when CS2 went out of support/they killed activation because they accientally assigned the key to EVERY Adobe account 
[18:09:21] <Hunterkll> so everyone got CS2 for free that day
[18:09:22] <Hunterkll> :D
[18:09:58] <Hunterkll> though
[18:10:01] <Hunterkll> i'm more wondering
[18:10:10] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: perhaps you had the subscription version.... and your sub expired?
[18:10:11] <PublicWiFi> SupremePizza: naw just a super cold :(
[18:10:21] <PublicWiFi> already had the corona this summer 
[18:10:31] <Hunterkll> yesh
[18:10:37] <Hunterkll> ya'll need to get on my health plan 
[18:10:39] <Telgareith> no
[18:10:40] <PublicWiFi> hope this shit clears up by thursday haha
[18:10:41] <SupremePizza> I saw that if you got cold symptoms there's a 1:2 to 1:3 chance it's corona
[18:10:53] <Telgareith> I'm on my account and it lists the software and a key
[18:10:57] <Hunterkll> booze + excessive hot sauce + stumbling around + etc
[18:10:59] <Telgareith> so I'm going to try to install it
[18:11:10] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: yea then i'd do that, if it doesnt work, ring support
[18:11:13] <PublicWiFi> maybe and i know the symptoms can be different but these symtpmos are vastly different than when I had it a few months ago
[18:11:15] <Telgareith> yup
[18:11:18] <Telgareith> that's the plan
[18:11:24] <Hunterkll> b/c the only generation of products that is offline/not activatable is CS2 and before
[18:11:28] <Telgareith> I thought adobe pulled an adobe and bent me over the bed
[18:11:45] <Telgareith> this is actually acrobat 12 from 2015
[18:11:57] <Hunterkll> still way post-CS2 lol

[19:19:44] <PublicWiFi> ofc
[19:20:04] <Hunterkll> yuken: literally everyone who's ever used a programming language more advanced than typing in what was in your commodore basic magazine
[19:20:05] <Hunterkll> :D
[19:20:10] <yuken> Called "item.getQuality.toString()", where getQuality is a function... and I was wondering why I was getting "<Java function...>"
[19:20:17] <Hunterkll> JAVA
[19:20:25] <yuken> Hunterkll, even worse. Java and Python combined.

[19:20:47] <yuken> BADGumby, yarp
[19:20:52] <Hunterkll> i was very colorful in my language
[19:20:55] <yuken> lol.
[19:21:07] <yuken> Hunterkll, I'm having to program in a Python interpreter in Java (Jython) for this job.
[19:21:14] <yuken> It can do Python _and_ Java at the saaaame tiiiiime. Magic.
[19:21:16] <teh_f4ll3n> lol. logged out of vCentre, logged back in, tried re-adding again and it worked
[19:21:27] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: yea sometimes shit does t hat
[19:21:29] <BADGumby> Yeah, we have some customers who use IBM WebSphere, which use Jython

[19:21:34] <teh_f4ll3n> 1-800-VMWARE-WTF
[19:21:38] <yuken> BADGumby, this is for Ignition, a SCADA framework.
[19:21:39] <Hunterkll> tbh my next step would have

[20:56:15] <yuken> lol Hunterkll. I couldn't find any smaller resistors shipping ASAP.
[20:56:24] <yuken> I'd have to either go to a local electronics store (I'm aware of 0), or wait a long time fron Jyna.

[20:59:36] <Hunterkll> yuken: https://www.jameco.com
[20:59:50] <Hobadee> Ok... anyone know why new AD domains register the DCs as A records in DNS?  This makes no sense and breaks our web server for internal users.  Any way to disable this?  Google is failing me....
[20:59:58] <yuken> Hunterkll, I'm retarded, ok
[21:00:15] <yuken> it's a resistor of the proper ohmz and way above current requirement.
[21:00:18] <yuken> so it'll work lul
[21:00:29] <Hunterkll> Hobadee: well, you're retarded
[21:00:33] <Hunterkll> Hobadee: but beyond that
[21:00:45] <Hunterkll> Hobadee: are you seriously hosting a website at your AD domain name?
[21:01:22] <Hunterkll> "Ad.domain.com " = all DCs register A records for that domain 
[21:01:24] <Hobadee> Hunterkll, No, that's the problem.  Domain auto-registers DCs as A records.  I added our web server as an alternate A record, but client may hit DC instead of web server
[21:01:35] <Hunterkll> ..... right 
[21:01:44] <Hunterkll> so you are hosting a website in your AD domain space
[21:01:55] <Hobadee> Is best practice to do "ad.domain.com" and not "domain.com"?
[21:02:02] <Hunterkll> 100%
[21:02:10] <Hunterkll> doing "domian.com" is asking for pain

[21:03:28] <Hobadee> I get that, but I thought they just relied on SRV records
[21:03:35] <Hunterkll> nope
[21:03:55] <Hunterkll> non-windows systems rely on A records harder
[21:04:04] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> and really the only problem is that you have to direct domain.com to the AD server for your internal network.
[21:04:05] <Hunterkll> windows can "get away with" only SRV
[21:04:34] <Hunterkll> Hobadee: long story short, you need to do what's callled "split brain" dns
[21:04:54] <Hunterkll> Hobadee: set up a forward lookup zone for www. and make A records inside of it
[21:05:07] <Hunterkll> thats your short term fix
[21:05:40] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> The biggest issue was telling internal staff to use www.domain.com instead of domain.com. And that was the end of it.
[21:05:41] <Hobadee> Ya, we already have split brain... Private DNS is in AD and public is in R53
[21:05:54] <Activ8> I don't even know why people use www now

[21:45:16] <A-KO> what's up Hunterkll
[21:45:24] <A-KO> just got out from washing my asshole
[21:45:31] <Hunterkll> A-KO: plotting some serious radio setups
[21:45:34] <Hunterkll> you? :P
[21:45:41] <A-KO> LOL
[21:45:47] <JollyRgrs> Hunterkll: are you suggesting that homes are built w/o a grounding rod properly connected?
[21:45:52] <A-KO> Nora and I and her wife are going to HRO this weekend
[21:45:59] <A-KO> and stopping at that Kaiba sushi/japanese place on the way
[21:45:59] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: absolutely yes 
[21:46:13] <JollyRgrs> that... uh... wouldn't pass inspection?
[21:46:18] <Hunterkll> most house grounding is code compliant, but only enough to pass
[21:46:23] <Hunterkll> not to actually be useful
[21:46:48] <JollyRgrs> how would it not be enough to be useful?
[21:47:06] <Hunterkll> we drove in 3 more 8 ft spikes just to get the ground plane stable here
[21:47:13] <yuken> look at this shit. also I'm aware that one wire is almost touching another, gotta fix that. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741130722697543753/912768429268803654/IMG_20211123_131114634.jpg
[21:47:18] <yuken> god I can't solder for crap.
[21:47:29] <Hunterkll> uh
[21:47:34] <Hunterkll> get some good snips
[21:47:37] <Hunterkll> and kapton tape
[21:47:41] <yuken> ya ya.
[21:47:45] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Learn to heat the wire not the solder
[21:47:56] <Hunterkll> we're not even there yet!
[21:47:59] <yuken> @FeralTerminator I'm heating the wire and solder pad.
[21:48:00] <Hunterkll> one step at a time
[21:48:03] <yuken> Not the solder.
[21:48:20] <Hunterkll> you obs solderd it enirely wrong
[21:48:23] <Hunterkll> but beyond that
[21:48:29] <Hunterkll> the red/black wire
[21:48:29] <yuken> Also this BMS is apparently rated up to 7.5A continuous, 4.2V
[21:48:30] <Hunterkll> jesus
[21:48:31] <yuken> that seems sketch.
[21:48:37] <JollyRgrs> dude! ok, for one, you need to use that cursive/fraction placemat later for learning while you eat s'ghetti-o's. please don't solder on it
[21:48:38] <Hunterkll> nah
[21:48:50] <Hunterkll> either way 
[21:48:52] <Hunterkll> holy shit
[21:49:00] <Hunterkll> you didnt tin  ANY of the wires properly
[21:49:03] <yuken> kek
[21:49:10] <Hunterkll> like what the f uck
[21:49:12] <JollyRgrs> looks like he just nutted some solder onto the wire after he sat on it
[21:49:28] <Hunterkll> there is NO ADHESION AT ALL 
[21:49:28] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Its official.. I have run out of shit to do today
[21:49:31] <Hunterkll> on the red/black
[21:49:36] <Hunterkll> like
[21:49:40] <Hunterkll> no adhesion at all
[21:49:42] <yuken> yes I'm aware.
[21:49:43] <yuken> It's shit.
[21:49:47] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> And I have 5 hours to go
[21:49:47] <Hunterkll> like it's just gonna fall off
[21:49:51] <Hunterkll> if he sneezes
[21:49:53] <yuken> yes
[21:50:07] <Hunterkll> you had a PRE TINNED SURFACE
[21:50:14] <Hunterkll> AND STILL FUCKED IT UP
[21:50:17] <yuken> yes lul
[21:50:27] <JollyRgrs> yuken: you need to go back to learning fractions and cursive before you start trying to solder
[21:50:36] <Hunterkll> fuck that
[21:50:43] <Hunterkll> he needs to get a learn to solder kit
[21:50:46] <Hunterkll> from radioshack
[21:50:52] <JollyRgrs> can't
[21:50:57] <Hunterkll> can
[21:50:58] <JollyRgrs> he'd have to buy it from your stash
[21:51:00] <PublicWiFi> oh  man
[21:51:02] <JollyRgrs> :P
[21:51:02] <PublicWiFi> your solders made me sad
[21:51:06] <yuken> yes PublicWiFi I'm aware.
[21:51:07] <nobyk> In my head, Hunterkll is like Gordon Ramsay but for electronics
[21:51:08] <yuken> first time I've soldered lol
[21:51:13] <nobyk> THIS SOLDERING IS FUCKING RAW
[21:51:15] <PublicWiFi> are you using a shitty non-temp controlled soldering iron?
[21:51:24] <yuken> eh. It has a potentiometer for temperature.
[21:51:27] <PublicWiFi> even a chinese temp controlled one is life changing
[21:51:31] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Atleast you admit that the job is shit
[21:51:32] <JollyRgrs> YOU ARE A SOLDERING IDIOT SANDWICH!

[21:51:45] <PublicWiFi> what kind of solder?
[21:51:48] <Hunterkll> fucks sake
[21:51:49] <yuken> shush Hunterkll.
[21:51:49] <PublicWiFi> pls say its not lead-free lol
[21:51:52] <yuken> I just need this thing to work.
[21:51:53] <yuken> PublicWiFi, lead free.
[21:51:56] <PublicWiFi> LMFAO
[21:51:58] <PublicWiFi> no wonder
[21:52:12] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: lead free is fine, if he has a hot iron 
[21:52:17] <Hunterkll> that's not an issue 
[21:52:19] <vinrock> man i used to love those electronics lab toys from radio shack
[21:52:25] <silentfury> people with DFS: any special considerations if i need to re-size a vdisk?
[21:52:26] <Hunterkll> not for big shit like this
[21:52:27] <vinrock> used to get one every christmas
[21:52:29] <PublicWiFi> shit doesn't flow for shit, get some proper 63/37
[21:52:33] <PublicWiFi> fuck lead free
[21:52:38] <vinrock> ew
[21:52:40] <vinrock> fuck silver solder
[21:52:40] <Hunterkll> silentfury: DFS? Like, DFS-R? 
[21:52:42] <PublicWiFi> if you are new to soldering its awful
[21:52:46] <silentfury> yeah, DFS-R
[21:52:49] <A-KO> and this is why PublicWiFi is on IRC
[21:52:53] <A-KO> because of all the lead he's ingested
[21:52:53] <A-KO> :D
[21:52:56] <PublicWiFi> :D
[21:53:02] <A-KO> oh hey it's silentfury
[21:53:04] <vinrock> i just got a new soldering iron :toot:
[21:53:04] <Hunterkll> silentfury: uhm, DFS-R doesn't care about the underlying storage
[21:53:05] <Hunterkll> so
[21:53:07] <PublicWiFi> just wash your hands before you eat and you're golden
[21:53:17] <Hunterkll> silentfury: you can just expand the volume without caring
[21:53:19] <JollyRgrs> or like... wash after you are done soldering?
[21:53:22] <A-KO> PublicWiFi: make sure to take your mercury while at it!
[21:53:26] <PublicWiFi> ^
[21:53:36] <PublicWiFi> yuken: honestly a lead-free solder will make your life better
[21:53:41] <A-KO> lead free + flux is fine ; just need to get stuff hot
[21:53:43] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> public i dont like being told what to do so im gonna shit on my hands before I eat to spite your recommendation
[21:53:54] <PublicWiFi> ^
[21:53:56] <PublicWiFi> amen brother
[21:53:58] <PublicWiFi> FIGHT THE MAN
[21:54:03] <vinrock> i assume lead fre gonna burn out your cartridges n tips faster
[21:54:08] <nobyk> You gotta twist that copper tho
[21:54:12] <nobyk> This looks wild
[21:54:30] <Hunterkll> vinrock: not if you use the right tools, but s tilll
[21:54:39] <A-KO> okay time for me to head into the office
[21:54:40] <A-KO> weeee
[21:54:41] <vinrock> i mean bcuz you gotta run it a lot hotter
[21:54:47] <PublicWiFi> right tools is keyword
[21:54:48] <Hunterkll> silentfury: but yes, just expand the volume
[21:55:00] <PublicWiFi> if you're using a cheap chinese pencil iron
[21:55:03] <PublicWiFi> just use lead-free
[21:55:20] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: i hoard leaded solder for a reason lol
[21:55:27] <JollyRgrs> "I hope you don't screw like you solder" - Hunter, probably
[21:55:32] <PublicWiFi> yeah I have a lifetime supply at home lol
[21:55:44] <vinrock> i need to pick up one of those wireless pencil irons that use the JBC cartridges
[21:55:45] <Hunterkll> when RS went bankrupt you bet that was the first thing i nabbed
[21:55:50] <cryptic1> holycrap that soldering job is terrible
[21:55:51] <PublicWiFi> itll prolly go bad from air exposure before I ever use it lol
[21:55:52] <vinrock> theyre cheap af and suposed to be awesome
[21:55:56] <nobyk> If you twist the copper, I'm sure it'll heat much more easily too yuken
[21:56:03] <nobyk> I don't know how you did it like that
[21:56:13] <Hunterkll> cryptic1: dude i could solder better than yuken when i was 11
[21:56:13] <cryptic1> so so so bad
[21:56:22] <cryptic1> so could I
[21:56:25] <nobyk> Hey it's his first time
[21:56:27] <PublicWiFi> yuken: when i first started soldering i was so close to giving up cause I just couldn't get the hang of it.. until I fonud some 63/37 solder... life changing xD
[21:56:38] <Hunterkll> bah
[21:56:46] <vinrock> yuken that soldering is horrific
[21:56:46] <JollyRgrs> i'm pretty sure just NOT soldering it and super gluing the wire to the contacts would be better
[21:56:50] <Hunterkll> just get a 50W iron and some quick touch approach
[21:57:01] <vinrock> touch the wires and wick the slder onto them
[21:57:06] <vinrock> also make sure you always keep your tip tinned
[21:57:15] <Hunterkll> if he had just tinned the wires first
[21:57:15] <nobyk> ^
[21:57:19] <Hunterkll> he'd have been fine!
[21:57:21] <nobyk> wet, slick and ready to go
[21:57:24] <vinrock> thats how i do wires
[21:57:32] <Hunterkll> but
[21:57:38] <vinrock> tin em first then just touch em
[21:57:40] <Hunterkll> look at that pad above B+
[21:57:41] <PublicWiFi> poor guy lol
[21:57:49] <Hunterkll> that pad above B+
[21:57:54] <Hunterkll> it's not even waving
[21:58:03] <Hunterkll> he just touched it
[21:58:07] <Hunterkll> and that was it
[21:58:07] <vinrock> if im doing smd ill use flux
[21:58:32] <PublicWiFi> yeah flux is a given with smd really
[21:58:36] <Hunterkll> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741130722697543753/912768429268803654/IMG_20211123_131114634.jpg
[21:58:39] <Hunterkll> still
[21:58:43] <Hunterkll> that SMD pad
[21:58:48] <Hunterkll> with NO MOVEMENT AT ALL
[21:58:51] <cryptic1> hahaha
[21:59:00] <Hunterkll> like
[21:59:02] <Hunterkll> WTF??
[21:59:13] <vinrock> there's a guy on youtube that repairs radios n shit, he has a god video on how to solder leme find it
[21:59:19] <vinrock> name is Carsons Lab
[21:59:27] <Hunterkll> NEVERMIND THE SOLDER SPLATTER AROUND THE AREA

[21:59:45] <Hunterkll> and that ground wire
[21:59:47] <PublicWiFi> yuken: also i like to heat the copper and apply solder nearby, as soon as the copper hits temp it starts wicking up the solder like crazy, instead of you melting it directly on top and hoping for it to adhere properly
[21:59:48] <vinrock> https://www.youtube.com/c/MrCarlsonsLab
[21:59:49] <vinrock> that guy
[21:59:50] <Hunterkll> wtf
[21:59:51] <Hunterkll> even

[22:01:42] * nobyk pounds chest with the peace sign
[22:01:50] <Hunterkll> ok i'm gonna point out
[22:01:53] <Hunterkll> right now
[22:01:58] <Hunterkll> i've seen a-ko solder
[22:02:05] <Hunterkll> it is MUCH better than yuken
[22:02:08] <Hunterkll> that's sad
[22:02:30] <vinrock> lol
[22:02:43] <Hunterkll> oh lets rephrase
[22:02:55] <Hunterkll> a-ko has RANDOM SOLDERING KIT BETTER THAN YUKENS BRAIN 
[22:02:58] <Hunterkll> laying around
[22:03:02] <Hunterkll> that he's never used
[22:04:18] <PublicWiFi> lol
[22:04:20] <PublicWiFi> dont be mean to yuken 
[22:05:30] <vinrock> at least it doesnt look like an ugly weld with globs of shit hanging off like a bundle of electronic hemmorhoids
[22:05:31] <Memer> Any fun or interesting things happen since I went to bed?
[22:09:10] <Hunterkll> Memer: someone posted their soldering "job"

[22:10:09] <PublicWiFi> ....
[22:10:12] <Hunterkll> vinrock: shit at least i wait for it to flow lol
[22:10:12] <PublicWiFi> dude is new at soldering lol
[22:10:14] <PublicWiFi> give him a break
[22:10:19] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: no no
[22:10:21] <PublicWiFi> >.>
[22:10:27] <Hunterkll> this is so bad
[22:10:33] <Hunterkll> he needs to know how bad it is
[22:10:42] <PublicWiFi> i think you've told him enough lol
[22:10:47] <PublicWiFi> and we all gave him some tips
[22:10:49] <Hunterkll> its like a jizz splatter of shit 
[22:10:55] <PublicWiFi> xD
[22:11:05] <PublicWiFi> so a shit splatter?
[22:11:12] <PublicWiFi> ;P
[22:11:13] <Hunterkll> something like that
[22:11:28] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: ive also given him much advice that would have avoided this
[22:11:35] <Hunterkll> but yolo i guess
[22:11:39] <PublicWiFi> how would he know what to do if it was new tho
[22:11:41] <PublicWiFi> -.-
[22:11:49] <PublicWiFi> I've done some really bad jobs when i first started
[22:12:25] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: literally my base rule of iron temp would have prevented this
[22:12:58] <PublicWiFi> did he ask BEFORE he did it?
[22:13:09] <Hunterkll> yrd
[22:13:11] <Hunterkll> yes
[22:13:12] <PublicWiFi> oh
[22:13:14] <Hunterkll> tha'ts the thing
[22:13:14] <PublicWiFi> lmfao
[22:13:16] <PublicWiFi> rip
[22:13:18] <Hunterkll> he asked a  LOT
[22:13:18] <vinrock> i learned how to solder building rc cars as a kid
[22:13:40] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: that photo is basically HE IGNORED EVERYTHING WE SAID 
[22:14:20] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_XgQhMPeEQ
[22:14:24] <PublicWiFi> still think lead-free solder would have made this a lot better of an outcome
[22:14:27] <Hunterkll> that's us laughing at him 
[22:14:33] <PublicWiFi> lol
[22:14:49] <Hunterkll> nah
[22:14:56] <PublicWiFi> damn im almost 2 hours late for luch
[22:14:58] <PublicWiFi> lunch*
[22:15:00] <Hunterkll> lead free/leaded for newbie usage
[22:15:07] <Hunterkll> no difference
[22:15:11] <Hunterkll> in performance
[22:15:13] <Activ8> who the fuck soldered that
[22:15:16] <Activ8> gary glitter
[22:15:21] <Hunterkll> Activ8: yuken
[22:15:30] <Activ8> jesus christ
[22:15:34] <vinrock> if i started with silver solder i think id have a much tougher time learning than 6040
[22:15:42] *** Joins: deksar (~deksar@user/deksar)
[22:15:49] <Activ8> looks like someone just shit all over the wires with silver poop
[22:15:49] <vinrock> i didnt understand the concept of heat transfer and oxidation
[22:15:51] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: i rest my case
[22:15:58] <Hunterkll> <Hunterkll> Activ8: yuken
[22:15:58] <Hunterkll> <Activ8> jesus christ
[22:15:59] <Memer> Hunterkll: What is that
[22:16:04] <PublicWiFi> lead free would have flowed wayy better
[22:16:10] <PublicWiFi> and would have at least cover the entire wire 
[22:16:12] <PublicWiFi> lol
[22:16:15] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi:  nope 
[22:16:16] <Activ8> some practice a little more there required me thinks
[22:16:22] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: he dint heat the wire enough
[22:16:28] <vinrock> but without flux and without transfering heat onto the leads, the solder would've just beaded off imo
[22:16:34] <PublicWiFi> at least you can do lead-free 50c cooler
[22:16:35] <PublicWiFi> lol
[22:16:47] <vinrock> wat
[22:16:51] <Hunterkll> vinrock: nah, hot hit it fast and you're good
[22:16:52] <vinrock> theres lead free that requires less heat?
[22:16:58] <JollyRgrs> if the wire was hot enough, it would have flowed
[22:16:59] <Telgareith> ^
[22:16:59] <PublicWiFi> or more, I've gotten away with 250c ez
[22:16:59] <Memer> Does it... at least work?
[22:17:21] <Hunterkll> Memer: who cares? look at the top red/black cable
[22:17:25] <Hunterkll> Memer: look at it
[22:17:26] <JollyRgrs> lol
[22:17:29] <Memer> oh god
[22:17:31] <Hunterkll> the pcb pad
[22:17:36] <Hunterkll> has no waving at all
[22:17:42] <Hunterkll> NO CONTACT
[22:17:43] <Memer> is the solder even like
[22:17:57] <Memer> yaknow.... doing anything on that cable
[22:17:58] <Hunterkll> yea
[22:18:03] <Hunterkll> just
[22:18:06] <Hunterkll> think about that
[22:18:08] <Memer> It looks like there's just a drop of mercury laying on it
[22:18:14] <vinrock> lol never thought about this
[22:18:15] <Telgareith> talk about hanging onto a thread
[22:18:20] <Telgareith> *on by a 
[22:18:21] <vinrock> jnco jeans you could feel your thigs rub together
[22:18:38] <vinrock> goddamn i cant wait for that silly shit to make a comeback so i can laugh
[22:18:50] <Hunterkll> Memer: see, the PCB HAS A FUCKING INCLUDED SOLER LAYER 
[22:18:58] <Hunterkll> and you can see
[22:19:01] <Hunterkll> it wasn't hot enough
[22:19:08] <Hunterkll> to melt the solder on the PCB

[22:20:18] <Hunterkll> yuken: congrats, you exposed yourself as a dumbass
[22:20:26] <Hunterkll> nobyk: yea but this is REALLY bad
[22:20:39] <Telgareith> I'll be reasonable
