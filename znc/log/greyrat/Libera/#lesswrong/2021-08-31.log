[04:20:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Suppose you ask someone “Would you bet on a coin flip, where you get $60 if heads and lose $40 if tails?”. They say no. This deviates from rational expectations" ... no it doesn't! When are people going to stop saying this shit!
[04:21:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> It absolutely does not deviate from rational expectations, because a rational person, offered a bet like this, will *rationally* conclude that the offerer is scamming them somehow

[04:44:54] * shawwwn feels worn out, suddenly
[04:45:47] <shawwwn> Apparently I’ll be joining Groq if things go well. (They seem to be so far.)
[04:46:25] <shawwwn> Ironically, their goal is to implement GPT-J inference
[04:46:39] <gwern> why groq?
[04:46:58] <shawwwn> “He who will have me, I bendeth over for”
[04:47:12] <shawwwn> But they turned out to be pretty incredible
[04:47:31] <shawwwn> I shouldn’t be surprised, since the guy who designed literal TPU v1s is running it
[04:49:12] <shawwwn> J and I (and H, G, F, E…) ended up talking about like a million things yesterday
[04:49:16] <gwern> (the original tpuv1s weren't that impressive)
[04:49:28] <shawwwn> You’d be surprised. I was.
[04:49:38] <shawwwn> Since I’m not under NDA, I get to tell everyone
[04:49:45] <gwern> I guess so, because aside from their ex-tpu resume, I'd heard little about groq to make me enthusiastic
[04:50:12] <shawwwn> 30 days before the Lee Sedol competition, Google was fucked, because their Go bot (trained on gpus) was nowhere close to skilled enough
[04:50:28] <shawwwn> TPU v1 wasn’t expected to help. But they tried it on a whim
[04:50:49] <shawwwn> It was so much more efficient that the trained model beat the gpu model 98 out of 99 games
[04:51:34] <gwern> ...how did tpuv1 help at all? it only did forward mode. I don't think you can do policy gradients with only forward mode

[04:54:01] <gwern> (also, alphago was written in torch, did torch ever even have tpuv1 support? although I suppose that's a lot less concerning than 'how do inference-only TPUs help at all')
[04:58:12] <shawwwn> I'll just say, I'm less competent than the source
[04:58:44] <shawwwn> so I don't know.
[04:58:54] <shawwwn> But he told me a funny story about the afterparty
[04:59:20] <shawwwn> Brin would do dinners where he'd invite all the various executives
[05:00:16] <shawwwn> so the dinner after winning Go, the software team exec (the team that actually implemented the model) was there, and so was J
[05:00:43] <shawwwn> he mentioned a few times (proudly) that TPU v1's literally fit in a hard drive case
[05:01:21] <shawwwn> The software exec was boasting about how it was all the software team's brilliance, and taking all the credit
[05:01:54] <gwern> 'To mitigate this problem, we generated a new self-play data-set consisting of 30 million distinct positions, each sampled from a separate game. Each game was played between the RL policy network and itself until the game terminated. Training on this data-set led to MSEs of 0.226 and 0.234 on the training and test set, indicating minimal overfitting. Figure 2,b shows the position evaluation...
[05:02:00] <gwern> ...accuracy of the value network, compared to Monte-Carlo rollouts using the fast rollout policy pπ; the value function was consistently more accurate. A single evaluation of vθ(s) also approached the accuracy of Monte-Carlo rollouts using the RL policy network pρ, but using 15,000 times less computation.' http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf#page=6 oh...
[05:02:03] <Robomot> PDF (37 pages; 1.6 MB) - Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search …
[05:02:06] <shawwwn> Brin turned to J and said "Go grab the v1s". (J happened to have several v1's with him at the time, presumably in his car or something.)
[05:02:06] <gwern> ...here we go, I think this must be it: the 'value network' is trained offline, from a very large dataset of self-play games, which apparently is *different* from the corpus generated for policy gradient training. I don't see how the PG could be done on TPU because you have to store all the choices/activations to do the backprop over, so what does a TPUv1 buy you? but this second network is...
[05:02:13] <gwern> ...trained offline on a giant dataset of board/move pairs, no policy gradients involved. generating that giant dataset would be well-suited to a bunch of tpuv1s, and
[05:02:52] <shawwwn> when J brought them in, Brin said to put them on the table. It was between J and the software exec, and the exec was kind of short, so he couldn't see J anymore
[05:03:07] <shawwwn> this obviously kind of interferes with natural conversation during dinners
[05:03:23] <shawwwn> J asked Brin "Can I move them?" and he was like "Nah, leave them there"
[05:04:06] <Betawolf> they can't see over a hard drive?
[05:04:07] <shawwwn> This was Brin's way of telling the exec that Brin knew TPU v1's were why they beat Lee
[05:04:17] <shawwwn> it was a stack of v1s, I think
[05:04:25] <shawwwn> (I wondered the same thing)
[05:04:33] <gwern> (so the TPUv1s were used to simply do 'forward mode white, argmax(white), forward mode black, argmax(black) UNTIL end of game', for 30 million games on a bunch of TPUv1s, and then the stored games were used to train 'board -> P(win)' on the regular GPUs; the TPUs were a bunch of additional compute while the GPUs were busy with actual backprop stuff)
[05:05:17] <shawwwn> that sounds correct, yes. When I asked why TPUs were such a decisive advantage, J said "because the model was able to explore so many more possibilities"
[05:05:25] <shawwwn> thanks to the efficiency gains vs GPUs
[05:05:31] <gwern> yeah. the TPUs could just generate way more games
[05:05:37] <shawwwn> mmhm
[05:05:40] <gwern> only so many GPUs on hand, after all
[05:06:04] <gwern> that is indeed an interesting detail
[05:06:28] <shawwwn> at the time, there were apparently several competing ideas (teams) within Google -- competing for what would eventually become TPUs
[05:06:33] <shawwwn> (because the TPU team won)
[05:06:36] <gwern> (the TPU dinner sounds like a story from a royal court or something, about the noble and wise king smacking down one of his knights bragging about the latest battle)
[05:06:40] <shawwwn> but none of the other teams ever delivered anything remotely usable
[05:06:48] <shawwwn> right?
[05:07:04] <gwern> that's one nice thing about being as big as google, you can parallelize competing teams/initiatives and keep the winner
[05:07:40] <gwern> also a good story about compute scaling/bitter lesson
[05:08:17] <shawwwn> I was still in ML trance mode (FF9 style https://youtu.be/u5iJ7RHNZ0w?t=2) when he was telling it, luckily
[05:08:28] <feepbot> Final Fantasy IX All Trance - YouTube (All Trance states and attacks for each character in Final Fantasy IX.0:02 - Zidane Dyne Trance3:14 - Vivi Double Black Magic Trance4:05 - Dagger Eidolon Tran...)
[05:08:29] <shawwwn> so I didn't consciously process things like "this was a person one step removed from Brin"
[05:08:37] <shawwwn> or think of it in the way you describe
[05:08:53] <shawwwn> but royal court is very apt
[05:09:42] <gwern> courtiers and hangerson
[05:09:52] <gwern> all performing for the king
[05:10:43] <shawwwn> the conversation is something of a blur, so I'm not sure where this part happened. But, at one point we got on the topic of long-term strategy. I think I was trying to convince him that JAX was the future rather than tensorflow, and that it was worth supporting, or something
[05:10:55] <shawwwn> I was like "That might be the way to get all the big players and then sell for a lot of money, but.."
[05:11:04] <shawwwn> he immediately was like "Actually, we're not for sale"
[05:11:21] <shawwwn> I pressed him and asked "Is your goal really to build a 10, 20 year company?"
[05:11:37] <shawwwn> he just said "When I was leaving google, they offered 10M for me to stay"
[05:12:01] <shawwwn> (he worked in ads, somewhat against his will -- a little bit of management jiu jitsu)
[05:12:23] <shawwwn> so the conversation quickly proceeded with the axiom that groq won't be selling
[05:12:43] <gwern> eh. everyone has a price. but $10m sounds about right
[05:13:03] <gwern> remember, it's not just the value to google, but ensuring the value doesn't go to *competitors*
[05:13:36] <gwern> (cade metz's book has a lot of instances of that. the absurd sums being offered to eg deepmind or sutskever are as much about attacking other tech companies than about the actual value to them of their work)
[05:15:14] * gwern adds the tpu anecdote to his AG annotation
[05:15:39] <shawwwn> the conversation was so interesting that it went on and on, and we were just getting to the good part of gaming out how to actually get GPT-J running on their hardware. But my 4:30 zoom call with Nat was approaching
[05:16:04] <shawwwn> I was like "As much as it kills me, I have a 4:30 with Nat Friedman, Github CEO, and I'd rather not bump the Github CEO..."
[05:16:21] <shawwwn> he basically burst out laughing and said small world, tell him J says hello
[05:17:09] <shawwwn> so I hop on with Nat and the first thing I say was "Jonathan Ross says hello!" and Nat laughed
[05:17:19] <gwern> (I was wondering what that referred to)
[05:17:23] <shawwwn> then he looked at his phone and chuckled that J had just texted him about it
[05:17:34] <gwern> :thinking_face:
[05:17:53] <shawwwn> turns out Nat's an investor in Groq, I think? something like that.
[05:18:32] <shawwwn> so I was telling Nat about groq and how they wanted to do GPT-J inference, and Nat said GPT-J was his suggestion
[05:18:50] <shawwwn> I was like "Good call! I'm apparently the person who's going to figure out how to actually get it to work"
[05:19:31] <shawwwn> and started talking about the creator of GPT-J kindiana, and he's like "kindiana? oh, Ben?" (simultaneously)
[05:20:03] <shawwwn> I was like yeah he's always just been kindiana to me, we were planning models in discord long ago
[05:20:56] <shawwwn> so jonathan and nat sort of mutually became interested in things I've been doing, which was a very ... unexpected anime arc
[05:21:28] <shawwwn> (Jonathan is j@groq.com, which was why I was calling him J for no real reason)
[05:21:57] <gwern> a heady day
[05:22:11] <shawwwn> when I was asking Jonathan about quanticle's (excellent) question about cerebrus wafer chips
[05:22:53] <shawwwn> J said groq's chips beat cerebrus, and that a certain vendor is now going with groq because cerebrus, <x, y, and z I forgot> were all slower
[05:23:17] <shawwwn> and pointed out that cerebrus' solution to the problem is "like making 500 copies of new york city" whereas groq's chip is a single copy
[05:23:34] <gwern> (but also a day that confirms what I always said to you - if you need money, leveraging your tpu expertise for google or someone would make you *so* much money)
[05:24:04] <shawwwn> well, we'll see. I'm still expecting it to fall through.

[05:24:21] <shawwwn> and it's not like I didn't try. Someone from the pytorch team DM'ed me and excitedly wanted to recruit me (to work on actual pytorch)
[05:24:47] <shawwwn> and was talking like "yeah, they adjust your salary based on your location, but most of your compensation is stock anyway..." and "I'll give you some interview tips when you get to the next stage"
[05:25:07] <shawwwn> so I apply, and the next day it's like "Thank you for your interest, we've decided not to pursue..."
[05:25:20] <shawwwn> I DM'ed them and they were like "This is BS! I'll find out what happened"
[05:25:37] <shawwwn> I just said don't worry about it, I was expecting it due to no degree
[05:26:21] <gwern> doesn't mean they should've rejected you
[05:26:49] <shawwwn> at one point during the convo with J, he asked (to my surprise) "So why hasn't Google hired you yet?" and I said okay, well, the smart move would be to say nothing and hope that I get through. But I'm honest to a fault: I'm a highschool dropout
[05:26:58] <shawwwn> he just said "Me too" and started talking about how he got his GED
[05:27:28] <shawwwn> and that their policy is "We like to say 'We'll hire someone even if they make the mistake of graduating'" which made me smile
[05:29:16] <shawwwn> we were on the subject of visualization / profiling, specifically TPU utilization numbers. I was pressing him for details because I secretly thought groq's claims were BS, or that they had a big unsolved problem still
[05:29:32] <shawwwn> he was saying that their utilization jumps between 6% and 100%, so it averages out to around 75%
[05:30:01] <shawwwn> I was like "that's right in the goldilocks zone, good. My associate Lucas only managed to get to 83% utilization once"
[05:30:54] <shawwwn> he seemed surprised, and I was also surprised that he was talking about 6% to 100% spikes, since our profiler is just a list of "1 minute ago, the MXU was at X%"
[05:31:32] <shawwwn> so I mentioned we only see 1 minute bins, and he was like oh! bring up our paper (https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ISCA-TSP.pdf) and turn to page 155
[05:32:01] <shawwwn> his point being, they have a profiler that knows the utilization at the *per-cycle level*
[05:32:10] <shawwwn> they show a breakdown of every single cycle

[05:32:53] <shawwwn> the next page (#page=4 didn't seem to work...) shows their data visualizer

[05:33:28] <shawwwn> (and https://i.imgur.com/iInMPby.png was the 6% to 100% spiky graph)
[05:33:45] <shawwwn> the data visualizer is pretty incredible. Top to bottom is time
[05:34:01] <shawwwn> left to right (they say "westward to eastward") is across the board
[05:34:29] <shawwwn> so for example, when you read memory from one chip in order to do a matmul, that's the "read" block
[05:34:55] <shawwwn> and then further down, it results in a "write" block, since it's writing to the local mem to do the matmul
[05:35:03] <shawwwn> and the VXM is the actual matmul I think
[05:35:08] <gwern> ('#page=4' works for me)
[05:35:30] <shawwwn> (oh. I couldn't see which page it was actually referring to. It'd be funny if page=4 was the correct one...)
[05:35:44] <shawwwn> and then below that you can see it writing the result of the matmul back to the original chip
[05:36:02] <shawwwn> I was pretty much like "GIVE ME THIS FOR TPUS" at this point
[05:36:16] <shawwwn> this afternoon he emailed: Shawn, here's a talk done by our team at U. Toronto. You may find the whole video interesting, but Mark Wong-VanHoren begins speaking about the visualizer at ~34:00.

[05:36:38] <shawwwn> my reaction was "At 43:40, when Mark showed the data *traveling across the screen over time*, my eyes went O_O
[05:36:38] <shawwwn> I'm curious about the westward-eastward abstraction (pretending that the chips are laid out in 1D) since the actual layout is 2D, connected in a space filling curve shape. Does a larger distance imply a longer travel time through the circuit? If so, that's brilliant."
[05:36:49] <shawwwn> and it went from there
[05:37:52] *** Joins: feepbot (~feepbot@ppp-93-104-169-72.dynamic.mnet-online.de)
[05:38:02] <shawwwn> they have at least three different teams, a profiler team, an application team, and an outreach team, and J was saying that it's up to the candidate to choose which path to go (presumably because he'd always been miffed at Google for forcing him into ads, so his company leaves it up to the new hire)
[05:38:22] <shawwwn> profiler team is obvious (they make what's in that video)
[05:38:41] <shawwwn> applications is like, the people getting models actually running on their chips for customers, or something like that
[05:38:56] <shawwwn> outreach, apparently, is shaping up to be their own incarnation of TFRC
[05:39:05] <shawwwn> so I was immediately like "I'd do outreach"
[05:39:15] <shawwwn> (I forget what he actually called it. Probably not "outreach")
[05:40:14] <shawwwn> so yes, potential energy is off the charts. But my actual energy right now is hovering around Joe Biden. so I'm keeping expectations low and seeing where it goes
[05:40:44] * gwern begins wondering if outreach would cover anime clip/dall-e
[05:41:56] <shawwwn> well, I got the impression that the plan (potentially) is to do something that turns out to be basically https://sites.research.google/trc/

[05:42:40] <shawwwn> (he'd never heard of TRC I think. At one point I was like "Hey I just wanna say, thanks for making TPUs, they changed my life and were the only reason I was able to do a damn thing as a researcher..." and he seemed really surprised)
[05:43:23] * shawwwn searches his poor memory. yes, I think that's All The Stories, other than the stuff J told him in confidence
[05:43:58] <gwern> shawwwn: huh. you'd think an ex-TPUer would know about TRC
[05:44:18] <gwern> poor TRC! I shill them for all I'm worth, yet, still even people who *made TPUs* have never heard of TFRC
[05:44:19] <shawwwn> to be fair, it's entirely possible I was just being an idiot and that he does know
[05:44:39] <shawwwn> heheh. well, I think he left google in ... actually, I have no idea
[05:44:47] <shawwwn> but TFRC was only a 2018, 2019 creation? something like that?
[05:45:07] <shawwwn> well, before 2019. But maybe not years before
[05:45:21] <feep> shawwwn: reading up

[05:45:26] <feep> sounds like you had fun~

[05:51:32] <gwern> well my point was that you'd get a lot more buckeroos with ML too
[05:52:40] <shawwwn> my current problem is that I'm almost dozing off, and the thing I need to solve before I sleep is "can this U.S. Bank business checking account that I just opened actually receive a $10,000 ACH transfer from <anonymous donor>?" because I don't want to send them the info only to hear it was blocked due to transfer limits

[06:02:15] <shawwwn> worse, I was correcting him. he was the one who said the right number
[06:02:34] <shawwwn> I was like "oh wait, two X per Y?" then was like "wait no"
[06:04:23] <shawwwn> so gwern was kinda correct about <gwern>  SHAWWWN: "My condolences on google relocating to beijing, I hear the air quality is awful there" INTERVIEWER: "???" SHAWWN: "And the pivot to farming pigs is a bold one!"
[06:05:13] <shawwwn> but then at one point later he asked me whether 8*8 was 64 or whether he got the math wrong, so we balance each other out
[06:05:29] <shawwwn> (luckily I knew that one was a no, 8*8 is 69)
[06:05:43] <gwern> when you work too much in binary and base-2
[06:06:47] * gwern stares at the author list: 'Dennis Abts, ...'
[06:06:59] <gwern> (how the *hell* do you pronounce that)
[06:09:47] <shawwwn> apparently it's ... https://youtu.be/NcEB-CPRFlI?t=4 uh ...
[06:09:56] <shawwwn> actually, even after listening to it I still can't pronounce it.
[06:09:58] <feepbot> How to Pronounce Abts - PronounceNames.com - YouTube (Audio and video pronunciation of Abts brought to you by Pronounce Names (http://www.PronounceNames.com), a website dedicated to helping people pronounce name...)
[06:10:28] <gwern> an anti-memetic name in the wild
[06:12:22] <nshepperd2> easy, it's abts
[06:12:31] <shawwwn> oh
[06:12:33] <shawwwn> true
[06:13:39] <gwern> anyway I do vaguely recall reading about groq's chip being deterministic and everything manually scheduled in lockstep, which explains why they can have such a good profiler, and in fact, had better have a fantastic one or else you're SOL
[06:14:41] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: removing the batch dimension didn't help :( because you see, for no good reason the convolution function in XLA *requires* a batch dimension. which means you have to add a batch dimension just for that op, then remove it afterward. which copies the tensor and uses the batch 2x memory layout
[06:15:08] <nshepperd2> and worse, for some reason jax decides to keep every one of these intermediate tensors around
[06:15:20] <nshepperd2> even when i'm not computing a gradient
[06:17:19] <nshepperd2> the oom error has like 15 conv_general_dilated ops in it, all using 2x memory
[06:20:29] <SDr> was thinking about the currently pending anti-trust case against faang, and I think I'm not optimistic about this resulting in any fundamental, structural changes: a rant
[06:20:47] <SDr> fundamentally, there is a conflict of interest by the state, specifically
[06:21:09] <SDr> on the breakup side, the general argument is to enable smaller firms to compete, and markets to work efficiently
[06:21:44] <SDr> however, unlike the oil, rails, etc industries, the info industry has a very unique position, in that it facilitates attention-economies, at large scale, with 90%+ US penetration rate
[06:22:38] <adiabatic> and I thought Neven Mrgan was the final boss of hard-to-pronounce names
[06:23:05] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: I've escalated the concern to our lord and savior TPU Jesus https://i.imgur.com/eemP1Db.png
[06:23:22] <SDr> and the conflict of interest comes from the state's interest of enforcing legibility, and large-scale social engineering;  specifically eg w/ fb: fbid is currently performs strictly better, than SSN;  and the censorship of eg anti-vax links (re: HN post a couple of days ago) serves gov interest
[06:23:40] <SDr> (and this is fucked sideways by having to make decisions under conditions of a pandemic)

[06:30:31] <gwern> (because FANG works a hell of a lot better than USG does)
[06:31:37] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: well, in that oom error, it is running the jitted unet in forward mode
[06:32:22] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: so why are there like a million conv_general_dilated ops in the error message
[06:32:42] <nshepperd2> surely there should be only one resident in memory at a time

[06:37:35] <shawwwn> I um...
[06:37:46] <adiabatic> gwern: then again, maybe the CCP realizes that most social-media companies are not _their_ golden geese.  It's not like they make loads of wealth and the CCP can spy on its people without nominally-third-party assistance…
[06:38:18] <shawwwn> IMO that's kind of a dumb request from bradbury, but I also see where he's coming from -- internal crap is a mess, I'm pretty sure they can't just pip install from public repos, and he's hoping to send this repro case to the XLA team
[06:38:40] <shawwwn> so although it sounds absurd to ask "could you remove every dependency other than dm-haiku?" it would also be valuable
[06:39:07] <gwern> adiabatic: well, the virtual gaming die is cast, so guess we'll find out in a decade or so how much soft power, exports, multinationalness, AI, and software development Xi sacrificed for the greater glory of the CCP

If structured data or objects were passed around, formatting could be left to a final formatting pass. But, with plain text, the formatting and the content are intermingled;
[07:46:04] <quanticle> because formatting can only be done by parsing the content out, it's common for commands to add formatting options for convenience. [...] People sometimes say that they don't want to support structured data because they'd have to support multiple formats to make a universal tool, but they already have to support multiple formats to make a universal tool. Some standard commands can't read output
[07:46:06] <quanticle> from other commands because they use different formats, wc -w doesn't handle Unicode correctly, etc. Saying that 'text' is a universal format is like saying that 'binary' is a universal format."

[20:31:31] <kuudes> over here we just have public healthcare

[20:35:56] <nshepperd2> probably one of the main reasons so much stuff is fucked up in the US is whatever communicable brain disease causes people to say 'free market' while actually calling for increasingly dysfunctional and soviet government-enforced bureaucracy
[20:37:39] <nshepperd2> in order to protect the free market we're cancelling municipal broadband and giving one company a legal monopoly
[20:38:38] <RiversHaveWings> they probably profit from the company somehow tbh
[20:38:49] <kuudes> over here there is government enforced free market on broadband
[20:40:01] <nshepperd2> RiversHaveWings: absolutely
[20:40:30] <nshepperd2> the true meaning of 'free market' is whatever lines the pockets of whoever lobbied the government the most
[20:40:32] <two2thehead> I'm unfamiliar with that. But apparently one Finnish law requires a certain amount guaranteed connection by law
[20:40:36] <kuudes> wire owners must lease their wires to other providers for "fair market price", and usually government does not have to do more than say "we inspected the prices on X and it appeared there might be market irregularity in it. we will recheck the price after 3 months, and if market is still irregular, we will set prices" and usually the market will then fix itself magically

[20:55:24] <rmmh> I like all the people that think China's 3-hours-internet-gaming limits are good, actually
[20:55:32] <kuudes> one of the perks of having a national alcohol monopoly is that it is one of the largests wholesale buyers of alcohol in the world

[20:56:07] <rmmh> Betawolf: you have to drink more to offset the sauna-induced evaporation losses
[20:56:17] <kuudes> but I am confused what ggreer means with some whiskey not being available here
[20:56:58] <kuudes> it might be not-cheap/more-expensive, but especially on more pricey stuff the tax does not matter that much, as it is a constant price per gram of alcohol

[21:06:01] <kuudes> Betawolf, eh?
[21:06:19] <kuudes> there are methods to vaporize alcohol and breathe that in. requires a special device
[21:06:45] <kuudes> gets you apparently a "sharp" drunk that goes up fast and down fast
[21:06:55] <Betawolf> kuudes: I mean if you were drinking you could better identify how much alcohol you're taking in and stop at your tolerance.
[21:07:16] <rmmh> why would it go down faster?
[21:07:17] <kuudes> yes, but you don't inhale alcohol meaningful amounts normally
[21:07:29] <rmmh> I would expect alcohol inhalation to spike BAC fast and it to go down at the normal rate
[21:07:36] <kuudes> lower amount of matter
[21:07:43] <nshepperd2> rmmh: normally you're still ingesting it for a while?
[21:07:49] <rmmh> because it's bypassing your liver?
[21:07:57] <kuudes> through your lungs, I think, yes
[21:08:00] <rmmh> nshepperd2: ah yeah, you have more that's being absorbed in your gut
[21:08:17] <kuudes> I am not an expert and I might be mistaken in this

[21:08:32] <kuudes> haven't tried, just third hand stuff
[21:08:35] <rmmh> are based on the averages for how long it takes to absorb/clear

[22:38:23] <rmmh> but you can... special order 6? lame https://www.alko.fi/en/services-shopping/alko-online-shop/special-orders

[22:40:01] <ggreer> yeah it's similar to utah's liquor stores. at least oregon lets you buy directly from the distillery

[22:51:20] <kiboneu> is consciousness being an illusion a new concept?
[22:53:14] <gwern> rmmh: 'we carefully designed it to failsafe, of course'
[22:53:30] <pompolic> dns resolution, perhaps
[22:53:56] <kiboneu> what makes one more conscious than a rock?
[22:54:43] <RiversHaveWings> "failsafe" means the alarm goes off if at any point it is not possible to detect if there is a fire?
[22:55:08] <RiversHaveWings> (They should use a different sounding alarm for that...)
[22:55:11] <gwern> not possible to *report* if there is a fire, I'd guess
[22:55:17] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[22:55:18] <saturn2> it seems like begging the question. whatever's experiencing the illusion would itself be consciousness
[22:55:28] <gwern> if you can detect a fire but not report it where you should, that's still a situation you should failsafe in
[22:55:35] <gwern> ie a 'heartbeat'
[22:55:42] <RiversHaveWings> *nods*
[22:55:58] <PapuaHardyNet> that cogito ergo sum argument was very dumb, I don't understand why people considered it a genius argument
[22:56:00] <kiboneu> it should be very obvious to the user whether the system is encountering an error or whether there's an error in reporting
[22:56:41] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: it's dumb to us moderns, but it's probably a leap compared to what came before
[22:56:49] <kiboneu> PapuaHardyNet: i don't know who considers it a genius argument, or even an argument
[22:57:38] <kiboneu> saturn2: there's an infinite recursion in there somewhere
[22:59:33] <saturn2> yes, if you explain consciousness in terms of conscious experiences, it's a circular argument

[23:11:53] <pompolic> what if 3d rendering is just qualia for computers
[23:13:08] <pompolic> also, one time i rooted a phone through some chinese magic software and it installed at least 2 apps that immediately started sending push notifications
[23:13:44] <pompolic> i learned it's a chinese magic app because of the language of the push notifications
