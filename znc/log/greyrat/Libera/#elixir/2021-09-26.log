[15:04:30] <inhortte> Hello. I'm having problems running a release with a name@server.blah and cookie. I have REPLACE_OS_VARS=true set and rel/vm.args seems correct according to http://sgeos.github.io/phoenix/elixir/erlang/ecto/distillery/postgresql/mysql/2016/09/18/storing-elixir-release-configuration-in-environment-variables-with-distillery.html
[15:05:14] <mouseghost> inhortte, what is your problem, though?
[15:05:30] <inhortte> That article is Phoenix specific, though I am not rrunning phoenix (just Plug). I'm relatively new to Elixir. I can start the app with iex, giving it a name and cookie, but as a release, it doesn't work. IE, I cannot connect to it from a remote shell.
[15:07:07] <mouseghost> so you want to utilize distributed erlang or something capabilities and connect to a node from a remote machine? did i get that correctly?
[15:07:21] <inhortte> There are many articles around about releases, but they seem to stop short in saying exactly how to start a release with a name and cookie.
[15:07:59] <inhortte> mouseghost -> yes. That's exactly it. I need to connect via a remote shell to run a few routines from time to time.
[15:08:52] <mouseghost> inhortte, do you get any error?
[15:08:54] <inhortte> I think I understand that -name & -setcookie are passed directly to the erlang VM (right?). I suppose I'm just not doing it correctly.
[15:08:58] <inhortte> There is no apparent error.
[15:10:00] <mouseghost> inhortte, try doing https://erlang.org/doc/man/net_adm.html#ping-1
[15:10:10] <mouseghost> :net_adm.ping(node)
[15:10:15] *** Joins: yauhsien (~yauhsien@118-167-48-21.dynamic-ip.hinet.net)
[15:10:33] <inhortte> mouseghost -> ok. I'll look. Thanks!
[15:11:10] <mouseghost> also make sure that your host actually resolves to your thing
[15:11:17] <mouseghost> cookie needs to be the same
[15:12:38] <mouseghost> i think it would be :net_adm.ping(:name@server.blah)
[15:13:07] <inhortte> I"m trying it.
[15:13:16] <inhortte> So I need to start my remote session with the same cookie.
[15:13:18] <inhortte> ok.
[15:13:21] <mouseghost> yes
[15:14:46] <inhortte> I'm getting :name@server.blah/0 is undefined.
[15:15:00] <inhortte> after a :net_adm.ping(:name@server.blah)
[15:15:49] <mouseghost> huh
[15:16:09] <mouseghost> you enter it in `iex'?
[15:16:49] <inhortte> I just used String.to_atom on name@server.blah and i received :pang
[15:17:00] <mouseghost> ye, so it didnt connect
[15:17:35] <inhortte> So it's my config somehow.
[15:18:07] <inhortte> Were there an example somewhere, I'd be a very happy camper. :)
[15:18:17] <mouseghost> can you ping server.blah at all? with normal ping in command line
[15:18:29] <mouseghost> inhortte, heres the documentation https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html
[15:19:25] <inhortte> yeah - the server itself is up.
[15:19:45] <inhortte> The app is running. No problem. I just haven't set it up correctly with a name and cookie (apparently).
[15:19:50] <inhortte> I'll read the docs you just send a link to.
[15:20:34] <mouseghost> ftr, you execute erlang function a:b() as :a.b() in elixir
[15:21:00] <mouseghost> ah i think your remote shell also needs a name
[15:21:37] <mouseghost> idk what else really
[15:21:54] <mouseghost> you could also perhaps try doing it all on one machine 
[15:22:02] <inhortte> i'm doing it all on one machine, actually.
[15:22:42] <inhortte> the problem is that the app that I'm running that I want to connect to is packaged as a release. If I run the app with iex and pass a name & cookie, connecting to it remotely works fine.
[15:23:04] <inhortte> I just don't know how to give it a name and cookie as a release. Where do I put it? How do I pass these options to erlang?

[16:39:37] <m1dnight> Can anyone recommend a mail service to use with phoenix applicaions? It's a hobby thing, so I'd prefer something with a nice free tier if possible.
[16:42:19] <Zaab1t> I can make a weak recommendation: https://www.mailgun.com/. We use mailgun at work, at it is very easy and flexible
[16:43:04] <Zaab1t> I say "weak" because I haven't used it personally and haven't used it with Phoenix
[16:44:40] <mouseghost> theres also sendgrid
[16:44:50] <mouseghost> and you could still just use your own local mail server
[16:45:02] <m1dnight> Oh wait. that's an option?
[16:45:10] <mouseghost> of course m1dnight :D
[16:45:21] <m1dnight> I thought it wouldnt integrate well with the mail lib
[16:46:06] <mouseghost> m1dnight, why not?
[16:47:02] <mouseghost> the most important reason people use external mail services is that it might be sometimes hard to get major servers such as gmail etc to deliver the mail, but thats doable. especially if you set up dkim and spf

[16:48:17] <m1dnight> I have a few domains on gandi, so I think that most of that is in their hands.
[16:48:35] <m1dnight> I mean, I'm not stupid and all, but mail servers are something I dread.
[16:48:49] <mouseghost> dkim and spf is what you set up yourself on dns and your mail server
[16:48:51] <m1dnight> I was proud when I got my cronjobs to mail to my gmail :>
[16:48:57] <mouseghost> wo o;
[16:49:15] <m1dnight> I'm going to stick with SMTP  from gandi for now then.
[16:49:23] <m1dnight> Seems like it works seemless with swoosh anyway.
[16:49:33] <m1dnight> On the other hand, sendgrid has a life-time free plan for very low mails/day
[16:49:37] <m1dnight> that's interesting as well.
[17:19:29] <m1dnight> Okay, so another noob question: I have a json api, and I figured I'd just generate an api token for the user and be done with it. That way the user can copy and generate it in their settings page.
[17:19:42] <m1dnight> But the Phoenix.Token approach seems more modern.
[17:19:57] <m1dnight> But then the user has to send their login through the api to get back a token, is that right?
[17:20:18] <m1dnight> that seems to be double the load on your endpoint for a single post.
[17:22:23] <Guest77> guys im getting "** (RuntimeError) environment variable DATABASE_URL is missing." when i try to run my phoenix docker container from https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/releases.html#containers
[17:22:29] <Guest77> any idea how to fix this?
[17:22:35] <m1dnight> You can set env vars on docker with the -e flag
[17:22:49] <m1dnight> so you probably need something like docker run ... -e DATABASE_URL=ecto://... 
[17:24:00] <m1dnight> the database url is something like "ecto://dbuser:dbuserpassword@dbhost/dbname"
[17:24:58] <Guest77> ah thanks m1dnight, i'll give that a try

[18:02:19] <inoas> I am running something like this https://hastebin.com/uqewoqebak.bash
[18:02:49] <inoas> and /usr/local/include/wx-3.1/wx has all the wx windows header files
[18:03:49] <inoas> but but ~/.asdf/plugins/erlang/kerl-home/builds/asdf_22.1.8/otp_build_22.1.8.log shows:

[18:05:03] <inhortte> Hello everyone. Another question here. I have a Erlang vm running that I cannot kill, started from a elixir release. I can connect to it from a remote iex shell. How can I stop it from this remote shell? Thanks...!
