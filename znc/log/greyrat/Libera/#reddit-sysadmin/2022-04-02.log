[00:17:39] <sideup66> ok so im here watching a training video about docker
[00:17:41] <sideup66> my head hurts
[00:18:06] <sideup66> wy does it exist? it pulls down full fledged linux distros....but somehow relies on the base? at this point I feel like for what purpose
[00:18:16] <sideup66> just build a vm and be done
[00:18:27] <sideup66> i get they arent maintained to the level a full OS needs
[00:18:29] <sideup66> but cmon
[00:18:52] <estranger> easier to deploy in a pipeline, shared kernel resources, easier for rolling upgrades
[00:21:16] <sideup66> yeah but now its copying literally two operating systems
[00:21:28] <sideup66> why not just share the host os, unless the user specifies they need something odd or specific
[00:21:37] <sideup66> cause now were cherrypicking pieces of the host
[00:21:39] <sideup66> and the guest
[00:21:53] <estranger> copying two OSes? 
[00:22:35] * sintax robocopy's estranger
[00:22:51] <sideup66> right, but the source container lets say has node...so in the Dockerfile, youd say "FROM node:alpine"
[00:22:58] <estranger> sharing a host makes that host a pet.. easier to scale things out as a container, do red/green
[00:23:03] <sideup66> so now the container supposedly has alpine linux in it
[00:23:13] <sideup66> but the host is running ubuntu lets say
[00:23:19] <sideup66> couldnt i skip the version of linux
[00:23:25] <sideup66> if im deploying to say, linux?
[00:23:37] <estranger> it's the userland of Alpine 
[00:23:47] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> The kernel is shared
[00:23:49] <sd> 09<Q​uasky> brb, backing up by dc to a blank box with robocopu /mir
[00:24:05] <sintax> perfect
[00:24:05] <estranger> the kernel is all from the host
[00:24:08] <csws> it's paravirtualised I think?
[00:24:39] <csws> reminds me of all those lousy cheap VPS companies 10 years ago
[00:24:45] <estranger> lol
[00:24:50] <csws> they loved using openvz
[00:24:50] <sintax> haha
[00:25:27] <sideup66> so its not the full operating system
[00:25:30] <sideup66> just whatever userland
[00:26:09] <estranger> when you have 100s or 1000s or more of instances running managing those on bare metal sucks ass. deploying VMs for everything is wasteful, and not as easy to do day.. upgrade an app version and rolling restart 
[00:26:27] <technonerd> https://bibliogram.pussthecat.org/p/Cb0ImuwLFFf/?utm_medium=copy_link
[00:26:38] <technonerd> Good weekend to visit my brother 
[00:26:39] <estranger> just recompose from :latest and off you go
[00:26:40] <sideup66> so its not a full OS....that makes more sense
[00:26:45] <estranger> yeah
[00:26:52] <sideup66> i was understanding it as the container running the WHOLE OS
[00:26:54] <Hunterkll> sideup66: note too, that container "OSes" are just minimal sets, not a full functional OS, and often, you end up going down the route of just the libraries/support you need for just the application itself
[00:26:57] <sideup66> i was like well now were just a vm with more steps
[00:27:24] <Hunterkll> like, with a windows container, all I ship is an executable and its supporting libraries for the most part, in addition to the cut down as fuck like 50mb windows supporting base 
[00:27:28] <estranger> I think VMs are more steps to customize and roll heh
[00:27:31] <sideup66> so as far as maintaining that....would it have the same problems say an install of alpine would
[00:27:51] <sideup66> as far as maintenance
[00:27:52] <Hunterkll> no because there's less you're dealing with, i suppose
[00:27:54] <sideup66> patching and the like
[00:28:10] <Hunterkll> and in reality, if you fit this model entirely, you just trash the containers and rebuild from the master updated image automatically 
[00:28:17] <Hunterkll> you don't actually patch inside the containers
[00:28:20] <Hunterkll> *if* you fit this model
[00:28:25] <estranger> recompose from :latest and rolling restart and yer done
[00:28:26] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> well i said screw it

[00:29:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:30:13] <Activ8> good, make sure it never needs a plugin installed

[00:34:04] <Hunterkll> DB2 is a fucking BEAST of a database engine for some of the stuff i've seen done with it
[00:34:10] <Hunterkll> especially on Z hardware
[00:34:23] <estranger> lol yeah man
[00:34:23] <Hunterkll> DB2 on linux and windows is hugely divergent from DB2 on z/OS and AIX though 
[00:34:37] <estranger> yes, it is heh
[00:35:00] <estranger> lot of my banks and finserv have that crap
[00:35:05] <Hunterkll> some common core, but i wouldn't trust DB2 on linux to handle 300TB image data tables while doing realtime in-engine image manipulation with insane queries in realtime 
[00:35:11] <PublicWiFi> estranger: :D
[00:35:18] <estranger> dump it all into mq and get it into the modern stack

[00:36:03] <estranger> I'm moving very large banks off mainframes for their main transactional systems... so
[00:36:21] <Hunterkll> estranger: different kind of workload, i'd imagine - that can distribute and process like that

[00:36:36] <sintax> you all are over thinking it all
[00:36:40] <estranger> MQ is the stop gap
[00:36:43] <Hunterkll> estranger: some workloads are very, verrrry hard to scale out versus scale up

[00:37:26] <Hunterkll> apparently Javascript was originally called LiveScript in beta before it was offically released
[00:37:30] <estranger> how to break your monolith up ... slowly
[00:37:55] <Hunterkll> estranger: data that doesn't lend itself well to that model can be a pain point, especially when you need guaranteed response times

[00:53:10] <Hunterkll> though, nation-wide ATC works on a far better clustering technology than most of the world uses anyway, and it's older tech than windows :P

[00:56:37] <bomb> I wonder if he had 401
[00:56:41] <estranger> got one ready to goooo
[00:56:55] <Hunterkll> estranger: true lockstep cycle by cycle instruction by instruction execution? :D

[00:57:24] <estranger> yup, then an aggressive heartbeat 
[00:57:49] <Hunterkll> the hell you using? that level requires hardware assistance at the machine level
[00:58:16] <estranger> huh
[00:58:37] <Hunterkll> estranger: as in, if both machines were halted, their hardware level states would be identical 
[00:58:47] <Hunterkll> IE: Instruction pending execution, register values, etc 
[00:59:05] <Hunterkll> as in both CPUs are executing identical instructions in separate boxes at the same exact cycle count 
[00:59:44] <Hunterkll> like VMware fault-tolerant VMs but at a more assurant and performant lower level 
[00:59:59] <Hunterkll> so you can smash beer bottles and piss in racks and code execution never stops even if you take out half the processors
[01:01:10] <Hunterkll> not just running the same process on two separate instances and comparing results
[01:01:15] <Hunterkll> running the machines at the hardware level in lockstep
[01:05:20] <int0x1C8> how do you do that without IPC
[01:05:46] <Hunterkll> black fucking magic 
[01:05:51] <Hunterkll> is how i view it
[01:06:11] <Hunterkll> very, very tight coding and synchronized launches otherwise 
[01:06:16] <Hunterkll> without hardware level assistance/communication
[01:06:27] *** Quits: wonderer (~quakeroat@user/wonderer) (Quit: Famous quotes #18: "I am ready to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter." - Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965))
[01:07:15] <int0x1C8> you'd either need an 'orchestrator' type thing keeping them in lockstep, or the workload must be deterministic
[01:07:59] <Hunterkll> in the simplest form, every machine receives at the same time the same inputs and the output is obviously compared 
[01:08:07] <Hunterkll> but yes, something like that is in play
[01:08:10] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> so black magic
[01:08:11] <Hunterkll> a good example would be the space shuttle 
[01:08:38] <Hunterkll> it had four AP-101 units on it, three running in lockstep same exact code, same inputs, providing outputs, if one of the three disagreed, the fourth one kicked the disagreeing one out 
[01:08:46] <Hunterkll> and delivered the results of the two that agreed 
[01:08:53] <Hunterkll> and indicated a non-critical fault, of course
[01:09:12] <int0x1C8> yeah I watched the deep dive video on the flight control hardware of the saturn V
[01:09:17] <Hunterkll> of course, that goes back to the tight code part
[01:09:30] <Hunterkll> you have to know *Exactly* how long your code takes to execute, and what the processor will do with it 
[01:09:30] <int0x1C8> flight control hardware is pretty unique in its requirements and such
[01:09:42] <int0x1C8> deterministic computing
[01:09:47] <Hunterkll> so things like out of order execution, predictive branching, etc - you have to know how it works and how to compensate for it
[01:10:19] <int0x1C8> it was smarter everyday with LTT lol
[01:10:23] <Hunterkll> and by compensate, i mean beat those features into submission, either by intentionally coding so they can't engage, or coding in such a way they reliably engage exactly the same way 
[01:11:23] <int0x1C8> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI-JW2UIAG0
[01:11:46] <int0x1C8> that and the behind the scenes vid are pretty cool
[01:11:54] <Hunterkll> NonStop is really unique in some ways, it runs all code on two lockstep identical processors, but it doesn't do multi-cpu processing persay, each set is running its own OS and own stack, so adding processors to a NSK stack doesn't have diminishing returns like adding CPU count to a regular server does
[01:12:14] <int0x1C8> listening to the old guy talk about how the telemetry worked and how you had to analyze it from raw octal dumps
[01:12:22] <Hunterkll> and there's another system continuously comparing the output of those lockstep processors 
[01:12:36] <Hunterkll> and the faulted gets shut off, and another processor is brought in to restore that fault tolerance 
[01:12:43] <int0x1C8> yeah the 'orchestrator'
[01:12:57] <Hunterkll> but that's more of a hardware level functionality in NSK systems almost
[01:13:36] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: funny, a while back I had to design a telemetry package, so I used the apollo era telemetry standards as my radio packet format :D 
[01:14:15] <Hunterkll> https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/102x0b5s.pdf
[01:14:21] <Hunterkll> that's a newer version of the standard I used 
[01:14:45] <Hunterkll> .... which was used for telemetry packages for balls thrown by giant trebuchets ...... 
[01:15:39] <Hunterkll> I like how that version of the telemetry standard written in 2000 has support for IPv6 already baked in 
[01:17:36] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: but if you're interested in that kinda shit, CCSDS's sharepoint is publicly viewable https://cwe.ccsds.org/default.aspx
[01:17:45] <Hunterkll> actually, i think their entire bloody website (ccsds.org) is built on sharepoint
[01:18:20] <Hunterkll> back when i built that kit around 2011 or so, they were still running sharepoint 2003 :D

[05:17:13] <sd> 08<J​TR> HSAs aren't really that all useful though for costs from major unexpected emergencies. They're also needlessly over complicated to manage and use effectively as well.:.

[08:56:52] <Hunterkll> huh?
[08:56:53] <Hunterkll> Addresses an issue that causes the Move-ADObject command to fail when you move computer accounts across domains. The error message is, “Multiple values were specified for an attribute that can have only one value”.
[08:56:55] <Hunterkll> .....
[08:57:01] <Hunterkll> you can move account objects between domains?!
[08:57:07] <Hunterkll> what fuckery is this
[08:57:32] <Cl0udNinja> I mean, that'd make sense if they were all in the same ad forest
[08:57:41] <Cl0udNinja> ex subdomain
[08:58:08] <Hunterkll> i mean
[08:58:17] <Hunterkll> but then it's a different domain and how does this work and jesus fuck
[08:58:25] <Hunterkll> something i've never thought about nor can see how the fuck or why it works
[08:58:38] <Hunterkll> thats like a domain rename x50 
[08:58:52] <Cl0udNinja> why wouldnt it? wouldnt it basically be the equivalent of creating a new account with the same values in the other domain and then deleting the original?
[08:59:36] <Hunterkll> yes but moving a computer account
[08:59:47] <Hunterkll> which implies a domain joined computer that uses said account
[09:00:50] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I dont get why you dont think that'd work
[09:01:03] <Cl0udNinja> I also am not an AD pro, but it seems logical to work
[09:01:23] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: well, the computer will try to authenticate as it is, computer.ad.domain.com 
[09:01:29] <Hunterkll> but that account doesn't exist
[09:01:34] <Hunterkll> since it's now computer.ad2.domain.com 
[09:01:39] <Hunterkll> but computer doesn't know that
[09:01:46] <Hunterkll> and still thinks and tries to hit ad.domain.com instead of ad2.domain.com
[09:01:55] <Hunterkll> so the move must leave some pointers behind or something?
[09:02:09] <Cl0udNinja> sure, but why would that mean that you couldnt move it?
[09:02:14] <Cl0udNinja> caching of course
[09:02:23] <Cl0udNinja> and the previous kerberos ticket with the old domain
[09:02:31] <Hunterkll> even in a two-way trust scenario or same forest scenario with two-way trust, you still have to know which domain you're trying to authenticate to for the domain controllers to be able to pass it to the right domain 
[09:02:47] <Hunterkll> since the account no longer exists in the original domain, authentication will flat out fail
[09:03:02] <Hunterkll> and you'd get the dreaded trust relationship error on the machine in question
[09:03:05] <Cl0udNinja> right, but it says nothing about what you personally do after the move
[09:03:31] <Cl0udNinja> but you should absolutely be able to move accounts between domains in the same forest... its all just metadata basically
[09:03:47] <Cl0udNinja> after that its up to the admin to handle whats done with the now broken system auth
[09:03:47] <Molnija> ugh, I need to uninstall the Kerberos `su` on my box
[09:04:05] <Molnija> it's _REALLY_ annoying
[09:04:24] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: i mean right, but why is this *allowed* 
[09:04:35] <Hunterkll> how are you supposed to resolve the after-effects etc
[09:04:36] <Cl0udNinja> why wouldnt it be?
[09:04:42] <Cl0udNinja> by thinking ahead
[09:05:08] <Hunterkll> there's nothing you can do ahead of time to resolve this
[09:05:21] <Hunterkll> other than disjoin and rejoin the machine
[09:05:25] <Cl0udNinja> right
[09:05:52] <Cl0udNinja> its probably an edge case feature like for merging corporations and shit
[09:06:15] <Cl0udNinja> rarely used but available because there was at one time, or still is a common or at least occasional need for it
[09:06:52] <Hunterkll> i mean
[09:07:09] <Hunterkll> we just did a two way trust and had users log in using their new ad credentials on the old domain joined workstaitons till they got refreshed out ;D 
[09:07:37] <Cl0udNinja> that may not always be possible because of security policies or things like that
[09:07:49] <Hunterkll> or the other scenario where we just did whole sites at a time and said "ya'll gettin new laptops"
[09:08:12] <Hunterkll> i've been through..... four or five of these types of migrations/implementations org-wide since i started my job
[09:08:13] <Hunterkll> fun times
[09:08:26] <Hunterkll> just when things settle down and we're getting into proper swing of things, a properly named AD and all that
[09:08:27] <Hunterkll> well
[09:08:36] <Hunterkll> now we're all settling in to an AD environment that's a .local 
[09:08:37] <Hunterkll> :'(
[09:09:14] <Cl0udNinja> oof
[09:09:59] <Cl0udNinja> I dont deal with AD shit, the most AD stuff I do is joining the domain during app dev for AD specific related problems with auth and shit
[09:11:02] <sideup66> is DoTheNeedful our overseas india support?
[09:11:09] <Cl0udNinja> !dtn sideup66 
[09:11:10] * DoTheNeedful sideup66
[09:11:17] <Hunterkll> heh
[09:11:22] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: AD is everywhere for us
[09:11:26] <Hunterkll> even in linux only environments
[09:11:31] <Hunterkll> we still have a few windows boxes to manage all the shit
[09:11:32] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:12:23] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, well, we're a dev company, the macs everyone has are basically just expensive jump boxes. most people spend their days in temporary VMs or if they're lucky enough to have their own hardware, and can do whatever with it
[09:12:55] <Cl0udNinja> I wish our IT team would hurry up with the colo move because we desperately need more power
[09:13:03] <Cl0udNinja> https://download-more-power.com/ isnt cutting it for them
[09:13:30] <Hunterkll> alright
[09:13:31] <Hunterkll> i hit shutdown
[09:13:37] <Hunterkll> let's see if the VM actually shuts down an dpowers off 
[09:13:51] <Cl0udNinja> you use hyperv not vmware right
[09:13:56] <Cl0udNinja> so no need for vmtools and shit
[09:14:20] <Hunterkll> well, that's mainly because it's baked in, but i use both 
[09:14:25] <Hunterkll> it's just this one VM 
[09:14:34] <Hunterkll> never dug into why
[09:14:44] <Hunterkll> should have opened a ticket on it a year or two ago when i noticed it happening just to figure out why 
[09:14:46] <Hunterkll> but oh well
[09:15:01] <Cl0udNinja> ah... I was going to suggest a reinstall of the vmtools stuff because I've seen that happen with vsphere/esx when the vmtools is corrupt or not installed
[09:15:04] <Hunterkll> i mean it shuts down cleanly
[09:15:07] *** Joins: Codaraxis_ (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis)
[09:15:15] <Cl0udNinja> instead of properly powering down it just goes into a freeze for the last instruction
[09:15:17] <Hunterkll> like, i hit reset, NTFS is marked clean, syslogs show all proper shutdown done up to the point 
[09:15:20] <Hunterkll> yea
[09:15:30] <Cl0udNinja> yeah that sounds like the virt/vmtools stuff being wonky
[09:15:37] <Hunterkll> it's like an old PC except it doesn't say it's now safe to power off this computer :P
[09:15:37] <DoTheNeedful> s/does/dose
[09:15:38] <layer8> Hunterkll meant: "it's like an old PC except it dosen't say it's now safe to power off this computer :P"
[09:15:49] <Cl0udNinja> oh man I miss that message
[09:15:59] <Cl0udNinja> back when you had to actually turn your own system off lol
[09:16:36] <Hunterkll> that just means you had a shit APM or early ACPI implementation 
[09:16:48] <Cl0udNinja> definitely early ACPI problems
[09:17:19] <Hunterkll> I mean
[09:17:20] <Cl0udNinja> I actually seem to have had a lot of bad luck with ACPI stuff throughout a lot of my hardware
[09:17:22] <Hunterkll> that message came after ACPI
[09:17:23] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:17:26] <Hunterkll> er
[09:17:28] <Hunterkll> before ACPI existed
[09:17:58] <Cl0udNinja> pretty much every system, except this one and my last laptop, I always had to deal with ACPI bullshit or something related to it
[09:18:13] <Cl0udNinja> my toshiba had ACPI issues because of the fucking wificard
[09:18:16] <Hunterkll> seems to be 
[09:18:25] <Hunterkll> that post-win2k on ACPI systems you wouldn't see that message
[09:18:39] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, that message disappeared at the dawn of 2k/xp
[09:18:53] *** Quits: Codaraxis__ (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[09:19:02] <Cl0udNinja> I only ever recall seeing it on 95/98/nt
[09:19:12] <Cl0udNinja> and 3.x of course
[09:19:18] <Hunterkll> right - MS required/enabled ACPI by default from Win2k onward
[09:19:27] <Hunterkll> Win98 was the first OS of MS's to support ACPI at all
[09:19:36] <Hunterkll> which makes sense, given ACPI was only created in 1996 
[09:19:54] <Hunterkll> Vista onward requires ACPI support in the bios apparently
[09:20:02] <Hunterkll> XP and before can subsist with just APM or nothing like that at all

[09:21:44] <Hunterkll> .....
[09:23:26] <Hunterkll> if this isn't you just being stupid, contact your state NLRB office and/or equivelent
[09:24:00] <yuken> Hunterkll, I am as well, lol.
[09:24:15] <yuken> Late paycheck claim is with state labor board stuff, but I am also going to see what else is there.
[09:24:16] <Hunterkll> you still work there? :D
[09:24:18] <yuken> Nope.
[09:24:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:24:23] <yuken> Hunterkll, his payment scheme was illegal, and my paycheck is past legal due day.
[09:24:30] <Hunterkll> neat
[09:24:31] <yuken> I didn't realise the former until I looked up the payment due dates.
[09:24:39] <Hunterkll> maybe you'll get enough money to not be broke
[09:24:42] <yuken> lol
[09:24:45] <Hunterkll> ah who are we kidding you'll blow it on some dumb shit
[09:24:55] <yuken> lol
[09:25:20] <Cl0udNinja> he'll spend it on a bunch of shit hes not legally allowed to buy yet and wont get his money back
[09:25:49] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: the retarded thing is it is stuff he's legally allowed to buy 
[09:25:59] <Hunterkll> he's just doing it in stupid ways and getting jammed up by process and policies
[09:26:39] <Cl0udNinja> well.. hes not the brightest qtip in the crayonbox, what can I say
[09:26:56] <Hunterkll> hm
[09:26:58] <Hunterkll> that's too generous 
[09:27:35] <Hunterkll> he's not the sharpest knife in the manure pile?

[09:27:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:28:13] <Hunterkll> i need to slap together this anderson trigger kit and see how it feels
[09:28:23] <yuken> Hunterkll, they're not sissy pins, they're the only ones longe nough to fit lol
[09:28:31] <yuken> Standard AR-15 pins are too short.
[09:28:46] <Cl0udNinja> you could've left the loops off and made it not look lame
[09:29:02] <Cl0udNinja> anodize the pins black so they arent sticking out like sore thumbs
[09:29:02] <yuken> I mean, true. I plan on cutting them down to length once my tools come in, Cl0udNinja 
[09:29:04] <yuken> so they are flush-fit.
[09:29:12] <Hunterkll> also i can't put a stock on my current toy

[09:37:56] <Hunterkll> oh hhuh
[09:38:06] <Hunterkll> it's not fixed ;D
[09:38:45] <Hunterkll> upgrade the VM config version to current and see if that helps

[09:40:02] <Hunterkll> well i'll be
[09:40:04] <Hunterkll> that fixed it

[12:22:42] *** Molnija is now known as LxGHTNxNG
[12:22:44] *** SirStripsalot is now known as SirSceptalot
[12:23:34] <yuken> SirSceptalot, filing my late payment claim on Monday, as well as getting a lawyer to start setting up either a civil suit or an out-of-court settlement.
[12:23:59] <yuken> He's already committed a misdemeanor via breaking labor laws, and failure to pay in 30 days is another. First-degree, most serious one before it's a feony.
[12:24:45] <SirSceptalot> when you do your shizzle on monday, can they still backpedal then and say "oh poop, let's quickly pay this guy his paycheck"?
[12:25:07] <yuken> No.
[12:25:20] <yuken> He's already broken labor laws.
[12:25:27] <yuken> In writing, over email, on Microsoft servers.
[12:25:30] <yuken> (aka. logged neutrally lol)
[12:26:10] <SirSceptalot> so best case for them is saying "we pay yuken $x" and you accepting that offer?
[12:26:38] <yuken> SirSceptalot, possibly. It depends on what their offer is.
[12:26:44] <yuken> Labor laws are taken incredibly seriously here.
[12:26:49] <yuken> Despite how few there are lol.
[12:27:00] <yuken> well, few in my state.
[12:27:03] <yuken> lots federally.
[12:27:40] <yuken> SirSceptalot, failure to pay bi-monthly is a misdemeanor with a $1000 fine and up to 1 year in prison. He's already done that. Failure to pay within 30 days of filing a claim is another of the same first-degree misdemeanor.
[12:28:23] <SirSceptalot> I can get that second part, but seeing how monthly payment here is the norm, that first bit seems wild :p
[12:28:31] <SirSceptalot> so then it's up to you to find the sweet spot of how much you can wring from them without actually having to go through the hassle of going to court?
[12:29:13] <yuken> Monthly payment is illegal here, yeah.
[12:29:18] <yuken> Also, yep SirSceptalot.
[12:29:29] <yuken> Me and a lawyer. We'll figure it out.
[12:29:35] <SirSceptalot> best of luck :)

[20:42:16] <Activ8> they don't have backups but then cry when they lose the data
[20:42:29] <Activ8> I used to work installing card machines and epos systems
[20:42:44] <CoJaBo> So this is a.. first. We just received a FOIA request
[20:42:51] <Activ8> We ended up charging for backup systems that ran in the background to a central offsite backup 
[20:43:13] <Activ8> EPOS systems are a fucking absolute nightmare to support
[20:43:33] <CoJaBo> Activ8: Yeh, that's why they call them POS systems =D
[20:43:47] <CoJaBo> I will never not make this joke.
[20:44:08] <Activ8> what was worse is my boss decided to do free year updates, I told him not too but no he wanted too
[20:44:19] <Activ8> I quit after 4 months because of this
[20:44:54] <CoJaBo> Clients losing data and then crying about it are pretty much routine here
[20:44:59] <Activ8> I ended up having to put a service desk in place to log all the jobs that where incoming there was that many of them
[20:45:06] <Activ8> about 40 a day requests from all over the uk
[20:45:15] <Activ8> wouldn't get the staff to properly support it 
[20:47:14] <CoJaBo> We're getting a couple thousand new tickets a day. I'm completely buried <_<

[20:47:49] <Activ8> that's a lot
[20:48:33] <Activ8> 400 staff - 5 tickets a day
[20:48:35] <Activ8> lol
[20:49:22] <CoJaBo> One of my favorites is a client who used what I've taken to calling RAID-R for their sole backup solution
[20:49:33] <Activ8> never even heard of raid-r
[20:49:58] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> I think company shops will get my backup service for free.. But franchises... $10 a month
[20:50:07] <CoJaBo> Most people aren't dumb enough to go with something that, er, "exotic"
[20:50:58] <CoJaBo> Activ8: Basically, they had 2 drives. Each split into 2 partitions. One of the pairs was striped, the other mirrored; and then those composite devices were then striped together.
[20:51:30] <Activ8> 2 drives? well that won't be a backup
[20:51:38] <CoJaBo> We weren't able to recover anything.
[20:51:38] <Activ8> not even with partitions
[20:51:54] <Activ8> that's hilarious 
[20:52:42] <CoJaBo> Technically, it might be recoverable for $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$, but the client couldn't afford to send the failed drive to the lab (it had some kind of catastrophic failure, the platters were siezed or stuck to the heads)
[20:54:26] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Yeah the shop thought they would just send the drive in to recover the data but shit a brick when told how much.
[20:54:42] <Activ8> if the client doesn't have a proper backup procedure then they can't afford a recovery that's for sure.
[20:55:07] <Activ8> security and backups are the things a lot of places don't care about until it fails
[20:55:12] <Activ8> and they are quoted mega money to fix
[20:55:19] <Activ8> they only learn once
[20:56:00] <CoJaBo> Sometimes they even have backups, but they overlook something in the process

[20:57:15] <CoJaBo> One of the wildest I've personally done, was a client that kept religious archived daily backups, on and off-site, in fireproof safes.
[20:57:35] <CoJaBo> Their mistake was using Symantec Ghost version, I think 3.0
[20:57:58] <CoJaBo> Building caught fire, burnt down to the foundation. Backups survived, Ghost did not.
[20:58:21] <Telgareith> *looks at his copy of ghost 3*
[20:58:33] <Activ8> Backups - 321
[20:58:39] <CoJaBo> Yeh, it took over a month to track down someone with the right version.
[20:58:48] <CoJaBo> And indeed, I found them on IRC lol

[23:41:05] <LxGHTNxNG> If I make a laptop show up at a friend's place, should I bounce it through me and make it Linux or nah? Related: is 4GB of RAM enough?
[23:41:36] <bomb> enough
[23:42:30] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> @bomb never done it, planning on trying it in madrid

[23:45:09] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> But I checked and 18-45 is considered normal

[23:59:01] <monr0e> LxGHTNxNG: I'd say 4gb is on the low side. 8gb is the least I'd consider, 16gb preferable
[23:59:23] <LxGHTNxNG> aight
[23:59:34] <monr0e> also yes, put linux on it
[23:59:36] <LxGHTNxNG> I've been hearing that too
[23:59:48] <monr0e> and an ssd if you can swing it
