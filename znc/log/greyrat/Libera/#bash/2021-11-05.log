[12:56:17] <emanuele6> !SECONDS
[12:56:18] <greybot> $SECONDS expands to the number of seconds since the shell started. You can also reset it (SECONDS=0) to start counting from 0 again.

[12:59:18] <emanuele6> if it's a single command or group of commands, just use time
[12:59:23] <emanuele6> !time
[12:59:23] <greybot> time is a bash keyword. See ''help time''. There may also be a time command installed on the system, documented in ''man time'' -- see faq 86 to bypass bash's time keyword, or faq 32 to redirect the output of time to a file.

[13:01:59] <emanuele6> $SECONDS gives you absolute time in seconds since you started the shell
[13:02:36] <emanuele6> or you can use $EPOCHREALTIME to get the absolute time in seconds, with 6 decimal digits of precision (microseconds)
[13:02:58] <emanuele6> but that is not really tracing the time it took the command to run

[14:18:45] <greybot> Cron is used for scheduling recurring jobs. at(1) is used for scheduling one-time jobs. crontab -e, /etc/crontab or /etc/periodic are places where you can configure jobs. The most common problems with cron jobs include %'s in a crontab (escape with backslash: date +\%Y), commands that rely on $DISPLAY, and having a different environment (eg. PATH/SHELL). See man 5 crontab.

[22:25:18] <emanuele6> because   ${!i[@]}   the syntax to get the keys of an array
[22:26:01] <emanuele6> and   ${!ref}   is the expansion that expands to the variable name as the value of $ref
[22:26:28] <emanuele6> i don't think you can use ${!ref} with arrays because of this.
