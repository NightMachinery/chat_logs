[02:46:16] <Joanna> Ignore feature has a few drawbacks one of which is that it doesn’t stop the person you are ignoring from seeing your conversation. And as was said earlier if other people don’t have troll on ignore, it will still destroy your conversations by distracting the people who don’t have it on ignore. It’s really a strange thing how many people would rather give up talking in irc than put a troll on ignore .
[02:47:35] <Joanna> I think when people see a troll in channel they judge the channel by it which i why I don’t allow trolls.
[02:49:36] <Joanna> Most people will not make a new channel to avoid trolls either even though they can..
[02:54:04] <shibboleth> also: "i don't wanna hear anything i might disagree with" is... well, if you can't figure out how that'll backfire both in isolation and at scale there's little point in me explaining it

[03:20:20] <Joanna> Personally I sometimes enjoy debates if they are interesting.
[03:21:38] <Joanna> I think the problem is most people have been conditioned to be oblivious to most thing that are happening around them.

[14:28:28] <CalimeroTeknik> most importantly, it's not a question of disagreeing, it's a question of whether anyone who disagrees with something is willing to respond to the arguments that support the something in question
[14:29:01] <CalimeroTeknik> trolls typically never respond to arguments and keep charging on, preferrably in a way that they know is aggravating
[14:29:53] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[14:30:11] <CalimeroTeknik> it's actually a frequent rule of debate channels: if you don't respond to an argument the moderator finds well-formed against your position, you get a ban
[14:30:16] <JimBuntu> gm Joanna , everyone
[14:31:00] <Joanna> This isn’t really a debate channel thank goodness :)
[14:32:22] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: there are all sorts of different ways of trolling, some trolls will try to tell you exactly what you want to hear :)
[14:34:39] <Joanna> As a rule I try not to believe things I can’t verify
[14:35:08] <Joanna> And tv <> truth
[14:36:37] <icy> evening folks
[14:36:58] <Joanna> Hi icy what’s new ?
[14:37:29] <icy> complaining out loud about having to write yet another RFC at work
[14:37:30] <icy> lol
[14:38:51] <Joanna> What is in an rfc usually?
[14:40:07] <icy> it depends. generally an outline describing a proposed change to something.
[14:40:48] <icy> since i work in infra, it's generally describing potential approaches to doing stuff, etc. and ppl get together and discuss the pros and cons.
[14:40:50] <icy> etc.
[14:40:50] <JimBuntu> Request For Comment
[14:41:05] <icy> indeed
[14:41:32] <JimBuntu> You don't like making those, icy ?  Is there something about the process that doesn't work well for you?
[14:41:45] <CalimeroTeknik> I've always been puzzled about the term "Request For Comments"
[14:41:54] <CalimeroTeknik> it's actually just a standard, isn't it?
[14:42:11] <CalimeroTeknik> sounds like a polite euphemism
[14:42:20] <icy> JimBuntu: i mean, that's all i've been doing for the past few quarters lol
[14:42:23] <JimBuntu> CalimeroTeknik, an RFC is the paperwork on the road to being an actual standard, but has become what people use as standards when it isn't officially turned into one
[14:42:26] <icy> i want to write code!
[14:43:07] <CalimeroTeknik> writing code is the reward after you're done thinking and debating and specifying etc
[14:43:25] <icy> true. but last i wrote /any/ code was 2 quarters ago. and i'm somewhat mad about it. 
[14:43:27] <icy> lol
[14:43:43] <JimBuntu> I view the RFC as a kind of ticket grooming, but on a larger scale and one that admits things can change at any time
[14:44:03] <icy> 'ticket grooming'?
[14:44:08] <Joanna> icy: be careful you might forget how to code.. it’s happened to me before..
[14:44:29] <icy> i try to keep myself busy with side projects 
[14:44:40] <icy> but i think i've run out of ideas for those, lol
[14:45:31] <JimBuntu> 'grooming' in this case is the act of formalizing a ticket and getting agreement from the stakeholders, and 'ticket' refers to whatever official form of textual system you use that covers the primary bases of describing a small chunk of work including the minimum requirements and often test methods.
[14:47:35] <icy> yeah i'm aware of tickets. never heard of ticket grooming though.
[14:47:44] <Joanna> I am sort of stuck struggling with a malfunctioning control that I didn’t write lately
[14:47:49] <icy> we call them 'cards'
[14:47:51] <JimBuntu> Ah, ok.  Different terms for it all over the place :)
[14:49:04] <icy> i think i'm just going to suck it up and write this RFC
[14:49:20] <icy> going to leave the org soon anyway :D
[14:49:37] <JimBuntu> I imagine if you can get the RFC written quick enough, maybe there is code waiting for you behind it :_
[14:49:55] <icy> sadly nope. it's infra changes so it's just mindless ops.
[14:50:07] <icy> unless you count yaml as code... :(
[14:50:21] <JimBuntu> I don't really count YAML as code, not in my heart ;p
[14:50:36] <icy> :D
[14:50:53] <icy> hey, it /is/ called infrastructure as code ... so ha!
[14:51:37] <JimBuntu> hahahahahaha
[14:54:07] <Joanna> Why don’t they hire non programmers to do rfc?
[14:55:37] <JimBuntu> You normaly want subject matter experts making those comments, so depending on the purpose/scope, it would be a mix
[14:57:44] <icy> we're a team of 30 odd, and we're all engineers. and yes, seconding jim: you want people who know the ins and outs of systems making these decisions.
[14:58:25] <Joanna> But why don’t they use programmers for qa?
[14:58:32] <JimBuntu> icy, do you at least have the benefit of a proper technical writer or is that basically you wearing another hat?
[14:59:12] <JimBuntu> We use people with programming backgrounds/skills/talent for QA... in part because we want them to be able to automate testing as much as possible.
[14:59:21] <icy> it's just me wearing another hat
[14:59:24] <icy> but thing is
[14:59:26] <JimBuntu> sorry icy
[14:59:41] <icy> i own the change so it's kind of expected of me to document it, i guess
[15:11:18] <CalimeroTeknik> I've been so down with having to document what I code, that I managed to merge code and documentation (in the declarative paradigm, using hierarchical decomposition)
[15:11:34] <CalimeroTeknik> documentation is now actively part of the code (not comments, the code)
[15:13:00] <CalimeroTeknik> of course you'll want an example, who doesn't like an example? http://ix.io/3r7m
[15:13:02] <SeaDough> ^ [text/plain]
