[02:59:50] <j7j2> Hello, first time here. Been reading a bit about linux distros and apparently, if i want to build a server and host my services myself at home in a VM, debian is made for that.

[03:01:07] <j7j2> I'm getting pissed at prices charged by hoster for 25gb vps and i have a 150/150 fiber line at home... so I guess it's more than ever the time to bring my belongings home...
[03:01:24] <somiaj> one main advantage of debian is its release policy, a release lasts for 2 years and is frozen, so you shouldn't get any changes happening that time
[03:01:36] <j7j2> Haven't downloaded anythinhg yet, that's where i'm at now. Let's explore that...
[03:02:00] <j7j2> yeah, that's what I read about and that is it insanely stable...
[03:02:26] <j7j2> Probably more than the electricity provider.
[03:02:37] *** Quits: sinaowolabi (~SinaOwola@102.134.114.1) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:02:57] <somiaj> Debian goes though about 6-9 months of testing the release before making it stable, so things do work well together. One issue with Debian is ensuring it has the versions of software you do want to run. Some prefer newer or rappidally developing software which dosen't fit in well with debian's philosophy
[03:03:28] <somiaj> (well more than that, but the frezze is about 6-9 months, which is when things stop changing and focus cna be on rc bugs)
[03:03:40] <j7j2> When choosing a "desktop?" if that's how they're called, which one would be lightweight and optimized on performance rather than visual effects?
[03:04:08] <j7j2> I used for a while lubuntu as a bootable toolkit on old pc's and it was doing the thing right...
[03:04:57] *** Quits: Anasko (~Anasko@user/wikiwide) (Quit: Client closed)
[03:05:00] <diederik> lubuntu is the LXDE desktop afaik, which is also available on Debian.
[03:05:10] <j7j2> thanks!
[03:05:32] <cheapie> j7j2: FWIW, if it's any help, the reason that I use Debian for a lot of stuff around here is that it sort of falls in the "happy medium" in regards to how easy it makes things.
[03:06:12] <cheapie> Like it doesn't feel like it's overly hard to use just for the sake of being hard to use (I'm looking at you, Gentoo) but it also doesn't feel like it's trying to hold my hand the whole way and then drag me off in some direction I don't want to go.

[04:18:20] <holycow> hi guys
[04:18:27] <bencc1> if you don't, that's fine.
[04:18:33] <holycow> i need to download a debian 8 package.  anyone know where those are archived?
[04:18:33] *** Joins: AliasAlreadyTake (~Alias@user/alias)
[04:18:42] <sney> !jessie sources.list
[04:18:42] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for Debian 8 "Jessie" has two lines: "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ jessie main" "deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main".  Be sure to run «aptitude update» after editing sources.list.  Also see <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <jessie/updates> <jessie-updates> <mirrors> and "man sources.list".
[04:19:02] <sney> looks like jessie (8) is still on the regular mirrors, or packages.debian.org
[04:19:05] <holycow> i found this but i can't find a package listing: https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/
[04:19:13] <holycow> sney, it is?
[04:19:14] <holycow> oh
[04:19:15] <holycow> weird
[04:19:51] <PMT> bencc1: if you want network engineers, a networking channel is probably a better choice. Telling people that if they don't understand your question they're not the target is a good way to discourage anyone helping you even if they know the answer.
[04:20:11] <sney> holycow: or hmm, maybe the factoids are out of date. anyway there's also archive.debian.org and snapshot.debian.org
[04:20:24] <bencc1> PMT: thank you for making this discussion productive
[04:20:50] <holycow> oh!

And apparently my upstream (ISP's) router doesn't like that and chokes up because it's artificially limiting my upload speed because I ain't paying for more, and itseems it's limiting BOTH

[17:16:01] <Khepra> also, I don't know if unattended-upgrades grew teh ability to reset services based on dependency or library updates. In my case, even, that wouldn't be possible as I require service orchestration, can't willy-nilly restart them
[17:16:05] <randall> aminvakil: I have it enabled for some of my servers, but then again they're also monitored, so I know if something breaks.

[17:17:56] <randall> yes
[17:18:05] <Khepra> for example, libssl.so.1.1 upgrades (for same soname), fixes a vuln, will nginx.service (due to /sbin/nginx linking to the soname) restart?

[17:24:51] <mattb0ne> is that a debian issue or a lenovo issue
[17:25:09] <aminvakil> Khepra: i will apply them as soon as i can when there is a security update to a library or application we are using, but i haven't thought of restarting services after upgrading them yet :)

[22:55:01] <Khepra> you _might_ be directed into software specific channel where it's far more likeyl to get support tho.
[22:55:08] <j7j2> silly,  no questions what so ever about cpanel... yet...

[23:32:11] <cheapie> UEFI mode has always been GRUB, AFAIK.
[23:32:57] <fluid> whatever happened to lilo?

[23:34:41] <cheapie> As far as using it for booting from the hard drive, it looks like it was still available in buster, but bullseye dropped it. I have no idea what state it was in or whether it had any sort of UEFI support (probably not).

[23:44:35] <Khepra> the dark ages of the interim
[23:44:57] <DHE> firefox was a rebrand. as I recall seamonkey had browser+mail/calendar in a single app and firefox was basically splitting the browser off from that
[23:46:05] <cheapie> All it's really there for is browsing the documentation that's stored on the machine, complete with some proprietary-looking Adobe Reader plugin (I guess that used to exist for Linux?) to render the PDFs.
[23:46:17] <somiaj> seamonkey was actually a rename once firefox/thunderbird split off and their web page editor died.
[23:46:44] <somiaj> Maybe it was just called the mozilla suite, but I think it was commonly just known as netscape which included a browser, a mail client, and a web page editor
