[19:10:26] <I_Am_M00t> I guess he's mainly pointing out the hypocrisy behind "round earthers", and that we don't admit to ourselves that our beliefs are products of trust rather than knowledge
[19:11:05] <I_Am_M00t> I guess that's part of the motivation why people go into nutty ideas like flat earth

[20:08:36] <Digit> that is an insanely tall order.   ... an example of wrongness, "not so debatable"   XD   your qualifiers seem to be positioned to rhetorically reaffirm your beliefs, not to discover more.

[20:08:58] <Digit> 1 what?  there's lots of examples of 1+1=3.  procreation for a clumsy obvious example.
[20:09:08] <causative> I said under the usual meanings

[20:14:24] <Digit> ok.  so, just emphatic hyperbole used the half dozen times you asserted certain wrongness.
[20:15:03] <causative> when did I use the words "certain wrongness"? I said "wrong," I didn't say "certain" - at least not perfectly certain
[20:15:14] <causative> I did at one point mention "99% certain," but this admits still the possibility of error

[20:24:17] <causative> I think even you believe the world is real
[20:24:41] <causative> you've constructed a kind of framework in which you like to say otherwise, but bottom line, if a bus is about to run you over, you're going to get out of the way, because you think the bus is real
[20:24:50] <Digit> "... always fascinated me, how people act on their beliefs.  they're just your beliefs.  they're not real."  -- Bill Hicks.
[20:25:01] <Digit> why do you think i believe?
[20:25:34] <causative> because you are presumably a functioning human being who has not died from walking in front of a train that he believed wasn't real
[20:25:50] <Digit> have i given some indication so?   or is just just riding on your prior world view of how everybody is, and presuming on probability of past perceptions of prior encounters, i'll be like that too?

[20:26:05] <Digit> i advocate non-belief... i think i mentioned that already.  ;D
[20:26:34] <Digit> i find belief a terribly poor tool with which to determine reality.  eeeeespecially when it's the only tool in the toolbox.
[20:26:44] <Digit> that big hammer, so shiny and aluring, so easy...
[20:27:19] <causative> you must be misunderstanding what "belief" is, then
[20:27:45] <Digit> it so often seems prone to epistemological blind spots, turning seemingly everything into a solely binary proposition.  how much of this is due to language, or inherent/inate to belief(ism) itself, idk.
[20:27:52] <causative> a belief is a propositional attitude - and it is a constraint on part of your behavior
[20:28:04] <Digit> that's one definition.
[20:28:15] <causative> if someone asks you, "where did you park your car?" and you say "Over there," and point, this means that you believe your car is parked over there
[20:28:23] <Digit> nah.
[20:28:28] <causative> that's what it *means* to believe your car is parked over there
[20:28:40] <causative> it means you respond in that way to that kind of question
[20:28:49] <causative> and it means you act as if you thought your car was parked over there
[20:28:57] <Digit> many other ways to describe that scenario, and what can be going on in the mind, in the brain, in memory, in perception, without needing that shiny hammer of belief.
[20:29:05] <causative> e.g. if you want to drive somewhere, you will use your belief to decide where to walk to find it
[20:29:14] <Digit> crazy.
[20:29:18] <causative> beliefs are what you use to make decisions to achieve what you want
[20:29:28] <causative> they are the information that you combine with what you want, to obtain what you do
[20:29:43] <causative> desire + belief -> action
[20:30:04] <Digit> and if that's the only tool in your toolbox, that's reality for you.  XD  no room to entertain other possibilities, of what belief is, no investigation of its effects because it's the only tool there is.  lol
[20:30:50] <Digit> in nirmalstidi... where are my beliefs?
[20:30:58] <causative> nirmalstidi?
[20:31:16] <Digit> the no-thought state achievable through meditation.  (i probably spelled it incorrectly)
[20:31:18] <megane> causative: you can believe something 99%. then you learn something new, then you believe it 50%. you learn yet more, you believe it's 1% true
[20:31:26] <causative> yes megane
[20:31:41] <megane> yet there's a truth?
[20:32:00] <causative> yes - what the truth is and what you assert the truth is are not necessarily the same thing
[20:32:19] <Digit> and good on those who do.   alas, it appears to be far stickier stuff than that in practice for most people.  induces cognitive dissonances, and sorta calcifies them (maybe litterally... considering the neurophysiology at play).
[20:32:22] <megane> causative: but no-one can tell what the truth is
[20:32:28] <causative> yes we can
[20:32:32] <megane> ok
[20:32:39] <causative> we can't tell *for certain*, but we can *tell*
[20:32:44] <causative> and we do
[20:32:50] <Digit> get me that true scotsman at last then.  n-N
[20:32:59] <Digit> my eye!   n_n*
[20:33:11] <causative> I can tell you that I'm wearing socks
[20:33:16] <causative> and I can tell you that I'm right that I'm wearing socks
[20:33:24] <causative> and I am right that I'm wearing socks
[20:33:26] <causative> and I am wearing socks
[20:33:38] <causative> am I *perfectly certain* that I am wearing socks? no.
[20:33:46] <megane> causative: how do you know you don't have a brain injury that just makes you believe so
[20:33:46] <causative> but I can make the other statements without a problem
[20:34:01] <causative> I don't know that megane , that's why I can't be perfectly certain
[20:34:08] <causative> but we can and do, still assert things that we are not perfectly certain about
[20:34:28] <causative> we have to make our peace with imperfect certainty and go on living and asserting things
[20:34:36] <megane> so this is just a debate about what the meaning of "truth" is?
[20:35:01] <causative> well at present I am not explaining what "truth" is, I am explaining what it means when I assert something
[20:35:11] <causative> (explaining it for like the 4th or 5th time this discussion, too)
[20:35:34] <Digit> after the conversation had, i'm still primed to consider the ways in which it can also be not true that you're wearing socks.  some ways, simple as adjusting scale (including, e.g. where there are no socks at that scale and range of perception), other ways, the socks are wearing you, other ways, you are not existant, on and on it goes.
[20:35:52] <causative> "the truth" is different from what people say
[20:35:58] <causative> sometimes, the truth coincides with what people say
[20:36:02] <causative> maybe even usually
[20:36:05] <causative> but not always
[20:36:08] <causative> sometimes people are wrong
[20:37:07] <Digit> there may be functional presumptions, givens, defaulting ranges and accepting linguistic shorthands... but still behind all that... reality and imagination are far more rich than the collapse to functional presumptions to get through the day.
[20:37:14] <causative> sometimes I am wrong, when I assert something is true. It kind of perplexes me that all this needs to be explained; it seems like something everyone ought to know.
[20:37:17] <CyberTailor> sadly, we don't experience objective reality, our brain constructs something okay-ish from sense organs
[20:37:32] <CyberTailor> and consciousness is just a reflection of that complex picture our brain makes
[20:37:34] <megane> sometimes people are wrong with 99% belief (not to be confused with certainty or probability)
[20:37:39] <causative> sure they are megane
[20:37:42] <CyberTailor> oof
[20:37:44] <causative> I don't understand how anyone gets into thinking like what people say is the same as what is actually true
[20:38:13] <causative> often it is, sometimes it isn't
[20:38:21] <Digit> causative: how it's said, and repeated... i see how they get into that.  :3
[20:38:35] <causative> the world isn't necessarily the same as what anyone says it is
[20:39:07] <CyberTailor> truth can be whatever is most convenient for society
[20:39:11] <Digit> presumably it's never like that.   if it were, it would be the thing itself.   like the word of god being reality itself.
[20:39:22] <causative> no, CyberTailor , what we *say* is the truth is not the same as the truth
[20:39:25] <Digit> we're just jabbing at the interface.
[20:39:33] <causative> society may say something convenient for itself - but the saying of it does not make it true
[20:39:47] <Digit> convenient shorthands, expediting past the unweildly complexity.
[20:41:06] <CyberTailor> causative: "chan culture" has similar understanding of the truth
[20:41:43] <causative> similar to what? and are you sailorR?
