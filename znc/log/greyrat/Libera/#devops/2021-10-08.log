[23:38:01] <AsenMx> Hello, can you guys advice me on few topics? It is about a devops team, we are newly build team, we are looking for some good practices how to set up our processes and way of working. I'm looking for advice about terraform best practices, jira best practices ( should we use some jira template), documentation structure and stuff like that. Any advice is more than welcome.
[23:38:48] <rawtaz> theres a ton of that on the net, what do you need from us that you cant simply find there?
[23:39:09] <rawtaz> just google <keyword> best practice
[23:40:03] <rawtaz> s/us/this channel/
[23:46:44] <AsenMx> rawtaz, I'm trying to have a discussion there is ton of information on the internet, however not everything on the internet is 100% true or a good practice in real life.
[23:47:53] <rawtaz> that is true. but if you want to have a discussion about something, you have to be *way* more specific than your original question.
[23:48:03] <rawtaz> you cant just ask "whats best practice in X, Y and Z" :-)
[23:49:20] <rawtaz> my general advice would be along the lines of; keep things simple, dont complicate it. dont try to make everything redundant and what not - it's rarely worth the effort. apply common sense. care a lot about code quality and cleaniness
[23:49:35] <rawtaz> so basically it all boils down to common sense :)
[23:51:47] <AsenMx> yeah, well let me give you some details. My I recently joined an OPS team that does cloud/automation/syadmin kind of stuff (what most companies call devops role) even tho its not actually devops. Then everyone on the team left, I mean everyone! Right now there are new hires on the team and none of them have idea what is going on. My goal is to rebuild the team and implement some good practices, honestly there is so much chaos i don't even know from where 
[23:51:48] <AsenMx> to start.
[23:53:13] <rawtaz> oh my :D sounds a bit funny that everyone just left.
[23:53:49] <rawtaz> yeah i hear you, thats not a fun situation to be in is it. but then again if you have the confidence from management and get some resources you can make things work the way you want
[23:54:06] <rawtaz> brb
[23:55:45] <AsenMx> even the CTO left :) so yeah nobody knows to do everyone expect someone to have all the answers, but nobody does. There are no processes, nothing. People just take up some tasks do them somehow (tickets get cloesd) and that's it. No knowledge share no documentation, nothing. My question is how to improve the knowledge share in the team?
[23:58:06] <slaughter> Implement standards. Sounds like documentation standards would be a good start
[23:58:30] <slaughter> "if a doc doesn't exist for $PROCESS/$TOOL/$ETC, you must create one as part of completing the ticket"
[23:59:34] <slaughter> PR templates with (small) checklists of things to do/link to are good for this. "## Please link to documentation used or created in completing this ticket"
[23:59:55] <slaughter> Can also use the CI system to enforce things
