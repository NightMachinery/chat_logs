[19:53:59] <artchad> mfiano: Can you take a look at dungen? There seems to be an issue with the way the seed is generated "The value of PCG::SEED is 97158005156339247886, which is not of type (OR NULL PCG::U64)"
[19:54:21] <mfiano> Show me the form you evaluated.
[19:55:41] <artchad> alright
[19:56:02] <artchad> It sometimes happens when generating the dungen. Let me start the game a few times until it happens.
[19:56:22] <edgar-rft> artchad: thank you, that sounds great - I think I must try myself later on :-)
[19:56:36] <artchad> maybe it's from borodust

[20:03:12] <mfiano> What do you get for (get-internal-real-time) ?
[20:03:30] <mfiano> This is a mistake in dungen, for sure, but just curious.
[20:03:45] <artchad> 2495536026
[20:03:51] <artchad> not very big
[20:04:41] <artchad> it seems that the seed can be bigger than what fits in a uint_64
[20:04:54] <mfiano> I'll patch it. Give me a few to remember my maths.
[20:05:17] <artchad> sure, take your time. It only happens sometimes, I can still work.
[20:16:30] <borodust> artchad: gamekit doesn't use dungen
[20:17:46] <artchad> yeye, I saw some cl-bodge stuff and thought it was part of some internal seed generation of something something.
[20:18:08] <artchad> but it my first instinct was correct, it was connected to dungen not trivial-gamekit or cl-bodge
[20:18:18] <mfiano> I know how to fix it, but I don't want to fix it that way. I need to do some refactoring to make it more robust.
[20:18:24] <mfiano> It may take some time.
[20:20:11] <artchad> I have not played around with randomness in that way, so I have no clue how complex that is.

[21:13:27] <mfiano> artchad: Do you ever supply your own seed, or do you rely on always random?
[21:13:32] <artchad> no
[21:13:39] <artchad> never ever

[21:15:14] <artchad> the important part is that I can fucking archive this project. I want to finally start learning sdl and opengl.
[21:16:33] <mfiano> seeds are now more convenient for users that want to share maps they find, for a game or whatever.

[21:18:43] <mfiano> Anyway, let me know if this fixes your problem.
[21:19:14] <artchad> I'll do.
[21:19:29] <artchad> looks like you added another system mfiano.misc.rng
[21:19:48] <mfiano> Didn't add it. It is already in that repo.
[21:19:53] <mfiano> But depended on it.
[21:20:32] <mfiano> I need to think of what to do about the dependency on "graph". That library is not compatible with my license.

[21:45:20] <artchad> I've just learned how to use submodules in git. "cd third-party && git submodule add  https://codeberg.org/artchad/mfiano.graphics.procgen.dungen"
[21:45:43] <mfiano> I use subtrees instead .
[21:46:43] <artchad> it didn't work with the github link https://github.com/mfiano/common-lisp/tree/master/graphics/procgen/dungen

[21:47:24] <artchad> I almost felt smug for thinking that you don't use that cool submodule feature
[21:47:25] <artchad> xD
[21:52:11] <artchad> I'm wondering how I could make sure a repo stays stable. When using quicklisp, it pulls the newest versions of libraries. Even if I archive a certain version of mfiano.graphics.procgen.dungen, that library depends itself also on other libraries.
[21:52:17] <artchad> what if those libraries change?
[21:53:10] <mfiano> You can't with quicklisp unless you place specific versions in your local search path, like quicklisp/local-projects. I use CLPM instead of quicklisp, specifically for versioned dependencies.
[21:53:35] <artchad> I'll look into that. Thanks.
[21:54:02] <artchad> btw. I've started like 50 games in quick succession not a single one of them crashed. I didn't touch the dungen related code.
[21:54:08] <artchad> the fix seems to work.
[21:54:16] <mfiano> Great
[22:05:18] <artchad> What form would I have to evaluate to optimize sbcl for compiling a binary?
[22:05:32] <artchad> (declare (optimize 3))?
[22:05:39] <artchad> it was something like that
[22:07:02] <borodust> (declaim (optimize (debug 0) (speed 3) (safety 1)))
[22:07:12] <borodust> or safety 0, if you feel lucky
[22:07:24] <artchad> borodust, thanks.

[22:23:08] <artchad> borodust: Interesting. when I compile the game with your proposed optimizations the exit bug appears again.
[22:23:12] <artchad> hahaha
[22:23:27] <artchad> actually
[22:23:40] <artchad> it seems to be non-deterministic
[22:23:48] <artchad> sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
[22:24:50] <borodust> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:25:01] <artchad> I started the same binary three times after another. two times it exited properly the third time it froze
[22:25:05] <artchad> magic
[22:25:17] <artchad> LOL
[22:26:03] <artchad> I have the error message
[22:26:26] <artchad> https://paste.debian.net/plain/1226666
[22:27:27] <artchad> the first two lines appear, even if the program quits properly
[22:27:57] <artchad> maybe that's some of my code
[22:28:12] <artchad> yeah, it's my #'bind-buttons function
[22:28:23] <artchad> so the interesting part are line 3-END
[22:30:47] <artchad> It seems to be every third run of the program.
[22:30:53] <artchad> it is shell-idependent
[22:31:11] <artchad> I started the game two times, each time in a new shell
[22:31:27] <artchad> the third time, it froze again, that was in the third shell.
[22:31:32] <artchad> maybe some driver issue or something.
[22:31:34] <artchad> who know
[22:31:35] <artchad> s
[22:40:29] <artchad> I honestly think it really is just an issue with certain Nvidia drivers.
[22:40:59] <artchad> the compile process is deterministic. But the behaviour of the OS is differs
[22:42:01] <artchad> it's also not guaranteed that the program freezes on the third run. Sometimes it's the first time. Sometimes I can exit like four times in quick succession after starting the game each time anew.
[22:42:14] <artchad> What do we learn from this? Use AMD GPUs

[23:30:14] <borodust> or don't use gamekit and switch to sdl2, who knows
[23:32:55] <artchad> I still appreciate trivial-gamekit. It has a special place in my heart. Your website has wonderful documentation for that.
[23:34:15] <artchad> I'll document everything I'll do extensively, if I every write a serious library. With examples and all that stuff. A libraries popularity is to a great extend determined by the learning resources it provides.
[23:34:33] <borodust> thanks! ❤
[23:35:41] <borodust> i'll swear I'll get back updating bodge/gamekit stack with latest technologies (mostly new :claw approach) fixing and adding few more bugs
[23:35:51] <borodust> *in a backward compatible manner, ofc
[23:36:01] <borodust> nothing gamekit dependent should break
[23:36:36] <borodust> i just have this little idea i'm excited about that needs immediate attention
[23:36:49] <borodust> i thought to myself two years ago
[23:37:11] <borodust> although, i'm glad it really worked out pretty well ;p
[23:38:10] <borodust> fruits are not just coming out, they are bolting out smashing at me
[23:38:37] <borodust> still remember this day
[23:39:02] <borodust> i was thinking how can i fit these cool PBR shaders from Filament rendering engine into cl-bodge
[23:40:00] <borodust> and at some point, when i felt like a was rewriting the whole Filament into CL.. why not just use Filament directly ;p
[23:42:14] <borodust> https://borodust.org/2020/06/12/claw-honing/
[23:42:40] <artchad> I read that article.
[23:42:53] <borodust> oh, thanks again :D
[23:42:54] <artchad> Would you say that :claw is beta quality?
[23:43:17] <artchad> oh
[23:43:17] <borodust> yeah, certainly
[23:43:31] <artchad> it says it at the bottom...LOL

[23:44:20] <borodust> as for that particular article, that was the turning point when I was completely fed up by reimplementing all possible gamedev wheels in CL ;p
[23:44:50] <borodust> notalone 3d i mentioned earlier is using that tech
[23:44:56] <borodust> Filament in particular
[23:45:13] <drakonis> borodust: any updates on claw and sbcl?
[23:45:17] *** Joins: rtypo (~alex@user/rtypo)
[23:46:43] <borodust> drakonis: nope, still running everything in ccl
[23:46:50] <drakonis> i see
[23:46:51] <borodust> everything claw related
[23:46:53] <drakonis> sucks.
[23:46:59] <borodust> well, not really
[23:47:18] <borodust> i mean, it's bearable, only the bindings generation is done on ccl
[23:47:31] <borodust> bindings themselves work anywhere cffi works
[23:48:12] <drakonis> i see
[23:48:13] <borodust> i personally tried sbcl, ccl, ecl and lispworks
[23:52:55] <drakonis> alright.
[23:53:49] <borodust> the best thing in ages was when the whole thing started working on android almost with no code changes
[23:54:41] <borodust> that happens when you rely on battle-tested libraries ;p
[23:55:25] <borodust> btw, there's a version of notalone-thriced for android, but I didn't have enough time to implement touch input so I didn't release it yet
