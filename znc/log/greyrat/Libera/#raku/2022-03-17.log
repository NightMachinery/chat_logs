[16:10:01] <stdInOut> hello, I just installed rakudo via tarball and its .sh script, and it shows me that I can start using it via 'raku.exe' while I am on linux ??!
[16:18:40] <stdInOut> or perhaps "raqu"; "rather quiet"
[16:20:10] <MasterDuke> do you prefer building yourself? you didn't want to use your distro's package?
[16:21:00] <stdInOut> MasterDuke, honestly, I didnt scroll down to see that there was a distro package. but then I suppose they are older.
[16:21:35] <MasterDuke> some are. but for most of those El_Che provides binaries
[16:21:35] <stdInOut> but why '.exe'  on linux? is it correct? :)
[16:22:12] <MasterDuke> yeah, something's funny there. what showed that?
[16:22:41] <stdInOut> when I ran the install script, the output showed that I could run that to start using raku
[16:23:02] <stdInOut> I didn't run it yet, though
[16:23:28] <MasterDuke> fyi, https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg has the up-to-date distro packages i mentioned before
[16:23:47] <MasterDuke> which tarball did you download?
[16:24:20] <stdInOut> ah great, thank you, are they newer than the distro ones here; https://rakudo.org/downloads ?#
[16:24:59] <stdInOut> I downloaded rakudo-moar-2022.02-01-linux-x86_64-gcc.tar.gz
[16:25:28] <MasterDuke> yeah. the ones listed there are the "official" distro packages, El_Che builds newer ones
[16:29:10] <patrickb> stdInOut: Thanks for informing us! That's a mistake. Fix is on the way.
[16:30:03] <stdInOut> ah, glad to have been of help, patrickb :)
[16:30:58] <stdInOut> MasterDuke, I will proceed with El_Che's downloads, thank you very much :)
[16:31:09] <MasterDuke> np
[16:31:44] <patrickb> stdInOut: There are quite a number of different deployment methods made available by different people. Most are kept up to date, amongst them are ElChes rakudo-pkg repositories and the precompiled tarballs.

[16:35:03] <patrickb> MasterDuke: rakudo.org/downloads tries to provide an overview of the different options to deploy a rakudo. Amongst others the official distro packages as well as rakudo-pkg are mentioned and linked to.
[16:35:10] <stdInOut> El_Che, sure, I will, thank you
[16:35:47] <patrickb> MasterDuke: I think stdInOut tried the tarballs that can be downloaded on rakudo.org directly. Those are kept up to date, just as rakudo-pkg.
[16:35:58] <stdInOut> patrickb, yes, I tried those
[16:36:12] <patrickb> El_Che: Btw. I value your work on rakudo-pkg a lot. Thank you!
[16:36:25] <El_Che> thx :)
[16:36:52] <El_Che> I just need to keep an eye on new distro release so I can support them :)
[16:37:13] <El_Che> before you know it, alpine has a major release, then fedora, then ... :)
[16:37:26] <patrickb> stdInOut: The tarball you downloaded first was the latest version and was up to date. Feel free to use ElChes disto packages or the tarballs, whatever suits your need better.
[16:39:36] *** Joins: razetime (~quassel@117.254.35.217)
[16:40:03] <El_Che> yes, tarballs work fine. They are essentially the same compile steps as rakudo-pkg
[16:41:35] <El_Che> tar balls have the big advantage you can install it in your hone in a machine without root
[16:41:57] <El_Che> pkgs have the advantage that they use repos so you can update easily with the rest of the system
[16:42:41] <patrickb> El_Che: Out of curiosity, are rakudo-pkg executables compiled with the relocatability flag set?
[16:43:21] <El_Che> yes
[16:43:56] <El_Che> in the past only the tarballs, but for some times all packages
[16:44:15] <patrickb> Is there a necessity? Don't the packages always install into the same path?
[16:44:24] <El_Che> not needed no
[16:44:30] <patrickb> (It doesn't hurt, just curious)
[16:44:41] <El_Che> just an if less, can be easily changed one way or the other
[16:44:57] <patrickb> ok
[16:45:01] <El_Che> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/master/actions/build.sh#L11
[16:46:06] <El_Che> you can tar your /opt/rakudo-pkg yourself and use it on an other machine on another path :P
[16:55:54] <stdInOut> patrickb, yes, I just typed 'raku' and was in. I will place raku folder in /opt now.

[21:38:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> which repl helper module do you advise? what is the difference?
[22:14:40] <tonyo> i use linenoise because it's smaller, easier to use with BSD. no real usability feedback for either though
[22:25:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I know that there is one that didn't work with backspace (or delete, I don't remember)
[22:32:20] <japhb> tonyo: Have you tried Terminal::LineEditor?

[23:14:20] <tonyo> i haven't, actually just saw it was added to the repl message
[23:17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> where can I check the installed modules?
[23:18:19] <ugexe> zef list --installed
[23:23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Okay, so apparently I am using Terminal::LineEditor at the moment
[23:23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> thx
[23:24:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and yes, it doesn't support delete
[23:28:11] <[Coke]> ugexe++ btw for all the zef work.
[23:30:47] <ugexe> m: say $*REPO.repo-chain.map(*.?installed).grep(*.so).map(*.Slip).map(*.meta<provides>.keys.Slip).join(",")

[23:36:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I feel the "raku 1-liner" way gave more results than zef list --installed
[23:36:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> built-in stuff?
[23:36:24] <ugexe> zef list --installed shows the dist name only, not the module names in those dists

[23:36:53] <ugexe> oh hey it installed it afterall
[23:38:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> XD
[23:39:21] <ugexe> its a nice bonus of using main
[23:39:25] <ugexe> raku -MZef::CLI -e '' install CSV::Parser
[23:39:31] <ugexe> that works the same as bin/zef
[23:42:00] <japhb> Nemokosch: I was thinking "How could it possibly not support delete?" and then I looked at the keyboard map and went "Ah crap, I forgot to map that key when I started supporting special keys".
[23:42:06] <japhb> Sigh, will fix.
[23:43:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Oh right, I found that ctrl+d can be used as a kind of delete
[23:44:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> thank you anyway
[23:45:27] <japhb> Happy to fix!  In the future, do feel free to say something right off when you notice something like that.
[23:46:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> now that we are at it... there is some button combination after which it stops taking input and eventually I found no other way than to kill the terminal as a whole
[23:48:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it revolves around alt and < > maybe?
[23:50:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> one thing is sure: once I press alt+í (which is the bottom left character next to shift and y in my case), I'm stuck

[23:52:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> same for alt+.
[23:52:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> maybe this is some terminal weirdness <:cameliathink:897316667653247057>
[23:52:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> doesn't cause any trouble on xterm
[23:52:54] <japhb> OK, the Delete is fixed in my local copy (I was right, it was just the missing entry in the default keymap, sigh)
[23:53:03] *** Joins: sena_kun (~koto@94.142.239.45)
[23:54:14] <japhb> The default keymap starts here: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/blob/main/lib/Terminal/LineEditor/RawTerminalInput.rakumod#L175
[23:54:42] <japhb> Alt-< and Alt-> are history movement keys
[23:54:56] <japhb> (Start and end of history respectively)
[23:56:08] <japhb> I don't have keymaps for the alt keys you're talking about, let me see if I can recreate
[23:57:34] <japhb> Hmmm, alt-. doesn't do it for me.  Which terminal and keyboard layout are you using?
[23:59:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> seems like this is a GNOME terminal and the layout... well, I think the dot part is the same. I tried standard Hungarian and programmer Polish (which is very much like a US QWERTY)
[23:59:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> alt+. is apparently some "let's iterate over the words from the terminal history" command
