[00:54:50] <Khepra> pack it in, buster!
[00:55:11] <randall> pingpongball: The one with the faster CPU behind it.

[01:01:13] <pingpongball> backport then
[01:01:16] <Khepra> packages in it almost certainly won't build or run even on sid without porting of some developer-local libs

[08:21:45] <sney> most remote desktop protocols are an improvement over vnc in some way, but it depends a lot on the connection and client/server OSes and various other factors
[08:21:55] <sney> xrdp is my preference because it includes auth

[08:23:43] <altker128> I mean, VNC Is screen grab + JPEG encode (or encode of some kind) with some type of semi-intelligent delta compression.  My understanding was RDP (at least if you have a Windows RDP server) is a lot smarter in the GUI operations and network transport

[12:41:13] <yupthatguy> Hi everyone.... I have a bit of a mystery... I am running Debian 10.5 on my server and I want to set some CPU quotas for apps and users...  but for some odd reason  user.slice and system.slice   don't exist at /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu   is this a bug? do I need to somehow activate them?  I was under the impression they should exist by default as part of systemd  I also installed `apt install libpam-cgfs` and rebooted but didn't seem to help...

[13:49:05] <yupthatguy> @Khepra I am a noob, so I will in-depth describe the situation as to answer your question... I am running ISPConfig control panel, I have nextcloud installation located at /var/www/clients/client5/web2    where web2 is a user with its own user-id.    My issue is that with every calendar sync to the server nextcloud is consuming up to 96% of CPU with user web2 and command php7.4-fpm.  My goal is to limit user web2 's CPU usage..

[13:52:38] <Khepra> yupthatguy: is that a specific service running as "web2"? Why I ask.  if that's really just one service (running as a dedicated UID) then you can easily set it via its service unit. IF it's a login(d) session, then you must mange user.slice for that UID, eg. with a user-${UID}.slice drop-in under /etc/systemd/...
[13:53:24] <Khepra> yupthatguy: I have no idea how all that would clash with ISPconfig. Using panels usually throws OUT any recommendation we give here because the panels hijack configuration in their usually insane, twisted, convoluted, vulnerable ways.

[13:54:41] <Khepra> yupthatguy: additionally, and this again might clash with whatever nonsense ISPconfig is doing, you can (should be able to) limit the number of php children for specific pool and thus limit nextcloud's pool to a certain number of workers. the web server will queue accepts in case of overflow

[13:55:36] <Khepra> yupthatguy: did you enable CPUAccounting=true for the slice?
[13:56:11] <yupthatguy> @Khepra  that is new to me let me check...
[13:56:34] *** Joins: stateless (~Thunderbi@2603:9000:7100:dda3:0:946e:fb6:cd71)
[13:56:43] <Khepra> and again, if that's single service running as web2, consider managing the service rather than the slice.   BUT ... with cpuaccounting, you actually enable it for all, with implicit default shares where it's not specified.
[13:57:31] <Khepra> which in turn means tuning particular number might be a bit tricky, and personally I've always found cpu limiting to be a huge mess because it's a barely deterministic heuristic
[13:57:42] <yupthatguy> @Khepra it is not a service...
[13:57:57] <Khepra> I'm more in favour of limiting number of workerr processes (whatever cpu one consumes), and more importantly, IO and memory controllers
[13:58:36] <Khepra> yupthatguy: how's nextcloud (sync) running if not as a service?
[13:59:01] <Khepra> but back to square one:  whta problems are you perceiving other than some number in some "cpu" column of some top?
[14:01:06] <yupthatguy> the service is php7.4-fpm  the user running the service is web2... (I am noob, forgive me if I turn things around).... I have no problem with the user web eating 35% of cpu for whatever processes it wants... hence I am trying to limit the user rather than php7.4-fpm because I have other apps that use the same php version
[14:02:03] <Khepra> yupthatguy: but the entire nextcloud's fpm pool is running as the same, one user, right?
[14:02:05] <yupthatguy> I am still investigating the CPU Accouting=true where is that located or how would I activate it?
[14:02:20] <yupthatguy> yes... one user ... web2

[14:06:09] <Khepra> yupthatguy: btw, I'm not sure how the cpu controller actually works now. it used to be that there were "shares" which come in effect when there's multiple processes competing, but if a single process is consuming cpu, like not "sharing" it, then the shares are meaningless

[14:08:45] <yupthatguy> yeah to my understanding from docs... CPUQuota sets a hard limit... meanwhile CPUshares divide the availble CPU usage inside the quota...
[14:09:19] <Khepra> yupthatguy: I'm not sure you'd want to  limit the entire nextcloud fpm pool like that, it'll seriously affect all other nextcloud operations, IO included
[14:09:41] <yupthatguy> I really think the CPUAccounting= value might be the problem....
[14:09:53] <Khepra> so back to my previous question: what's the actual problem. CPU limiting is ideally done in shares, so you assing more (or less) cpu time shares to one slice RELATIVE TO others
[14:10:28] <Khepra> but absolute limiting, especially to something as large as nextcloud as a single "unit", I'd avoid at all cost

Now, yes, you do have only one php-fpm service BY DEFAULT, but nothing stops you from adding a nextcloud specific fpm-pool .service unit in parallel and confine it with all the might and magick of .service unit options
[14:48:57] <MaxFrames> but via terminal I can see that I have an eth0 wired adapter, set to dhcp

[14:50:46] <Khepra> also it would NOT be eth0 by default, but a "predictable" udev rename
[14:51:27] <Khepra> yupthatguy: no, my suggestion is to create a separate php-fpm-just-for-nextcloud.service, which creates a separate PHP-FPM pool, which you configure just for nextcloud and can then properly manage the unit standalone

[14:53:38] <MaxFrames> just to clarify: the first thing I did was "ip addr", and eth0 comes from that. hold on a sec

[14:55:14] <yupthatguy> @Khepra, I will make a post on superuser  and see if any useful tips come out of it...
[14:55:45] <Khepra> yupthatguy: well I just told you what to do. you're not in any way obliged to use the defaults that packages set up. you are free to configure the nextcloud in its own pool
[14:55:58] <Khepra> that'd be vastly better for management, than trying to fiddle with slices
[14:56:40] <MaxFrames> dunno what that would do, I have no internet connection from the vm.... as networking is not configured
[14:56:42] <yupthatguy> sorry... I missed this message in the stream "no, my suggestion is to create a separate php-fpm-just-for-nextcloud.service, which creates a separate PHP-FPM pool, which you configure just for nextcloud and can then properly manage the unit standalone"    I hear you...

[14:57:10] <MaxFrames> bash: nc: command not found (from su -l) anyway
[14:57:55] <Khepra> yupthatguy: it's easy. you can copy the existing php7.4-fpm.service unit into /etc/systemd/system/php-fpm-nextcloud.service   or name it whatever, jus NOT php7.4-fpm.service
[14:58:13] <Khepra> yupthatguy: then you need to tell THAT instance of fpm to use a SEPARATE config file which defines only one pool: the nextcloud pool.
[14:58:56] <Khepra> the option is --fpm-config  which is already given in the default unit
[14:59:23] <Khepra> so, copy THAT into a fpm-nextcloud-or-whatever.conf  and set up just ONE pool, for nextcloud

[15:01:27] <Khepra> MaxFrames: ah the 169.254/16 subnet. that's link-local addressing, meaning you don't have a routable IP
[15:01:48] <yupthatguy> @khepra...  ok semi-understood... let me take a brain break and see if I can figure this out.... I am literally self-taught in all of this... sometimes learning the -very- hard way :-)
[15:02:03] <Khepra> MaxFrames: which means you should be able to set up static IP via network manager (gnome settings). alternatively, use /etc/network/interfaces with an iface stanza, and NM will stay away from it
[15:02:30] <Khepra> yupthatguy: I just hope that's not a public server somehwere accessible on the internet

[15:18:59] <Khepra> MaxFrames: it means /etc/network/interfaces
[15:19:39] <Khepra> if you set up eth0 in /e/n/i then NetworkManager won't touch it by default, so that's normal
[15:20:05] <Khepra> okay so /e/n/i works, you get the IP and routing and dns is all ok?
[15:20:55] <MaxFrames> yes it seems to be working
[15:21:09] <MaxFrames> but still, Gnome thinks I have no ethernet
[15:21:24] <MaxFrames> and whatever I did in NM, it had zero effects
[15:21:44] <MaxFrames> actually I just selected eth0 under "ethernet" from the drop down menu
[15:21:58] <MaxFrames> the other parameters were already correct there (ipv4)
[15:23:11] <MaxFrames> this was a test install to prepare myself to upgrade the production machine from buster. now I'm scared.
[15:23:31] <Khepra> NM won't configure eth0 if eth0 is defined in /e/n/i . that's defined by "managed" option of NetworkManager.conf under the ifupdown section

[15:26:39] <Khepra> alternatively, remove the iface entry from e/n/i and pursue the solution through NM . it _should_ work, it's just that perhaps sometimes it's buggy. maybe you can "forget" and re-create the interface via NM

[15:47:58] <MaxFrames> aaargh
[15:48:09] <MaxFrames> here is what worked:
[15:49:18] <MaxFrames> "service NetworkManager restart" => after this, I opened NM and found I now had *three* connections all bound to eth0, of which one was the one I created earlier, one was named "ifupdown" and one "eth0" freshly created

[15:50:31] <MaxFrames> lo and behold, now I have a working connection AND a working GUI (network icon and settings in gnome)

[15:52:06] <Khepra> that's the bug to report to then
[15:52:45] *** Quits: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[15:52:54] <Khepra> NM is designed to be clicky-clicky interface. you use its UI to manage, change, edit, add, remove "connections". if any part of that "requires" command line service restart then it's a bug
[15:52:59] <MaxFrames> it just seems strange to me that a dummy n00b like myself can find out such a bug after two month the thing's out in the wild
[15:53:57] <MaxFrames> expecially since my setup was in no way "strange".... it did all this by itself, basically. the only peculiarity is I'm working on an hyper-v vm which is undoubtedly not a common choice
[15:53:59] <Khepra> MaxFrames: thing is "nobody" really uses NM to manage static interfaces
[15:54:17] <Khepra> it's not a typical workflow and it's quite likely nobody else encoutnered this issue or did but never reported
[15:54:23] <jelly> not on debian at least
[15:54:35] <Khepra> on debian I mean, yes. Fedora and RHEL friends use NM exclusively.
[15:55:32] <Khepra> but their NM is not the same NM in debian, not the same version, not the same integration patterns and I'd bet not even same distro patches
[15:56:57] <furrymcgee> Service restart requires probably a NetworkManagerManager

[18:33:03] <Khepra> dka_: you can write a systemd .service unit, probably Type=oneshot roughly judging from your question, taht executes a shell script that does your bidding

[18:36:27] <silly> there's enough time until 2022
[18:37:09] <Khepra> there's really nothing to it. You need a boilerplate .service unit with a [Unit] section that defines dependencies, and [Service] section with at least one ExecStart anda  Type=oneshot

[18:43:59] <Khepra> btw rc-local service already exists by default in debian
[18:44:47] <Khepra> so you "just" need to add your things into /etc/rc.local . but there's no dependency ordering, the network may or may not be available at that point. using rc.local promotes flakey, buggy services.

[22:32:28] <somiaj> jimm: that ist installs the firmware, rebooting will often load the firmware (easy way vs reloading the module)

[22:33:05] <jmcnaught> please sir, could I have a little more firmware?
[22:33:10] <somiaj> jimm: This may not be an issue, sometimes there are multiple firmware files that it looks for, just because it doesn't find one doens't mean it won't find another that works. Look at 'ip addr' do you see the interface (assuming you have rebooted/reloaded the module)
