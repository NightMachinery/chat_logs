[00:00:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Picked up a "Best American SF/Fantasy of 2021" short story anthology at the library recently. Been trying to slog through it... boy, it is some slog
[00:00:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is just absolutely dire stuff
[00:00:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not sure I'll make it even halfway
[00:01:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Mostly unknown authors, mostly or all minorities of some description... there's an N. K. Jemisin one in there which is just stupendously bad
[00:01:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Absolutely incoherent mess
[00:02:55] <gwern> how many are actually about racism and global warming?
[00:03:08] <feep> I mean, you picked up a "best american sf/fantasy" anthology, what did you expect
[00:03:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Eh, there's not too much of that, explicitly anyway
[00:03:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's see, so far we have:
[00:03:51] <gwern> ok how many are implicitly about racism/global warming
[00:04:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> A story that's, I guess, about killing Death, but it's a very dumb story
[00:06:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> An unbelievably idiotic story about how a kaiju destroyed a city but this is ok somehow because it was just doing it to protect its young; the protagonist finds some of its unhatched eggs and raises one of its offspring (getting people killed in the process, including herself, and ensuring more deaths in the future), because ... it's... unfair? somehow? to not do that? It's so stupid
[00:07:15] <gwern> she's just ensuring a future for the japanese film industr
[00:07:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> A story about... honestly, not anything - this is the Jemisin piece - it's her attempt to replicate a Grimm fairy tale, apparently (but without the bad stuff like anti-semitism (???)); it totally fails at every level
[00:08:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> A story about how some conservationists' efforts to preserve a species of merrow (that's the general term for mermaids+mermen) goes awry when one of the last surviving mermen turns out to be gay
[00:08:52] <gwern> wow, a dangerous vision indeed
[00:09:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also in this story merrow are dumb animals, except when they're not; the story doesn't take its premise seriously enough to be consistent on this point, which is par for the course here)
[00:09:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> A story about how one day in the mid-19th century, it becomes impossible to kill any woman
[00:10:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The author then does things with that premise that are simultaneously completely ludicrous and also totally underwhelming)
[00:10:19] <gwern> (and they usher in a feminist utopia by slaughtering any men that resist, instead of a more realistic dystopia where people can be tortured for all eternity?)
[00:10:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope neither of those things, instead history just kinda proceeds as normal except for some bullshit
[00:10:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's what I've gotten through so far
[00:12:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a lot of "magical realism" going on in these stories. It's the worst, the absolute worst kind of it, where the author just uses "magical realism" as an excuse to be maximally lazy and do no work at all to make their setting internally consistent, to make the behavior of their characters make sense, etc.
[00:13:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Arbitrary weird shit just happens, and it neither has any kind of (logically or narratively) meaningful reason, nor are its consequences explored or extrapolated believably or coherently or at all

[01:13:51] <pompolic> then i read "did a truth table write this" and laughed
[01:15:06] <ggreer> also they need a 100kwh battery for each truck, or a 130kwh battery for the longer range version. for comparison the largest tesla model s battery is 100kwh. most of their cars are 70ish kwh
[01:15:49] <ggreer> so they need to ramp up battery production to ~25% of tesla's current production in a year. yeah good luck with that
[01:16:05] <kuudes> how much is tesla's current market share in EVs btw?
[01:16:16] <ggreer> in the US? 2/3rds of EVs
[01:16:22] <kuudes> in the world?
[01:16:41] <ggreer> no idea. EV becomes kinda blurry when you include the golf carts sold in places like india
[01:17:06] <ggreer> but it is crazy that tesla has sold 2x more EVs in the US than all other auto manufacturers combined
[01:17:37] <galambo_> can you own an ev if you dont have a house/garage?

[01:18:07] <kuudes> in japan you need a proof a parking space but that is re all cars I think
[01:18:22] <kuudes> galambo_, in loading stations or at work?
[01:18:32] <ggreer> you can charge it at charging stations. also you can run an extension cord

[01:19:20] <kuudes> why?
[01:19:32] <galambo_> I dont know if they have charging stations
[01:19:38] <ggreer> I parked my model 3 on the street for about a month before I moved out of california. it was mildly annoying to take it to a charging station every week or so, but charging stations are next to restaurants and shopping areas
[01:19:47] <galambo_> ah cool
[01:19:51] <ggreer> so you can usually run some errands while it charges
[01:19:54] <saturn2> maybe ford will sell the trucks without batteries and you'll have to insert your own 18650s from aliexpress

[04:26:34] <catern> you don't federate?

[04:26:45] <catern> nevermind then lol
[04:27:01] <namespace> catern: I do not. What on earth would I federate with lol.
[04:27:06] <ardent[m]> I generally recommend freespeechextremist as a starter instance if you're looking for the benefits of decentralization, since it has no block rules on following content on other instances
[04:27:09] <namespace> I could federate with schelling.pt, but that's mostly bots.
[04:27:45] <catern> does not federating mean someone on other instances can't follow accounts on extropian.net?
[04:27:55] <ardent[m]> Note it's a very high power-level kind of instance though, the name is pretty self explanatory
[04:28:47] <catern> maybe I'll just set up self-hosting during my year off
[04:28:48] <ardent[m]> (Alternatively if you have a server laying around, host your own, but you won't get a good whole-fediverse feed since that only shows people followed by someone on your instance)
[04:29:05] <adiabatty> sounds fun, but I don't even join NSFW channels in discord with tasteful toplessness, much less want loli wafting by
[04:29:32] <saturn2> catern: i think it only means that nothing from other servers shows up in the feed on the front page

[04:34:16] <namespace> Sorry.
[04:34:27] <catern> i see
[04:35:13] <namespace> If you want just like, a fediverse account.
[04:35:23] <namespace> You should use schelling.pt or one of the intellectual instances.
[04:35:34] <catern> i will use schelling.pt then
[04:35:41] <catern> but also I should just self-host
[04:36:30] <namespace> You should just self host yeah.
[04:36:32] <catern> (I can actually justify it as a project because I think I could do some interesting wacky stuff by combining an activitypub server with some of my other projects)
[04:36:43] <namespace> Pleroma is easy to self host and low resource footprint.
[04:37:07] <namespace> Also don't get me wrong I'd love to federate.
[04:37:29] <namespace> But, I don't want my instance clogged up with porn/spam, and Pleroma doesn't provide fine grained enough controls in the config and UI to do what I actually want.
[04:37:36] <namespace> So I'll probably end up having to modify it/roll my own at some point.

[04:38:17] <catern> that's pretty weird

[04:38:46] <namespace> - Everything else 
[04:39:02] <namespace> And on extropian.net, 'everything else' would actually be nothing because I'm whitelisting lol.
[04:39:32] <catern> I'm guessing maybe this is the result of mastodon/pleroma/activitypub encouraging server-level censorship, because, like, I see no reason why you should ever see posts/reposts from anyone you aren't actively following - whether your server is in contact with ("federating with"?) their server should have nothing to do with that
[04:39:37] <namespace> Though, I would probably be more open to 'everything else' if I just say, blocked all incoming media attachments.

Also I'd like to be able to clear the media cache at will, not sure if pleroma supports that.

[13:44:45] <capisce> "Someone asked him about the sales of the program and Professor Little started to explain that it was very popular. It was so popular, in fact, that pirates were copying his program and redistributing it for free. And then our professor broke down crying in front of all of us.

[17:26:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Continuing adventures in consumerism: I decided to just re-buy the hand mixer I had (which died). (It seems that Serious Eats doesn't recommend using the dough hook attachments on any hand mixer - having tried it, I agree; plausibly that contributed to the motor giving out. Ok, fair enough, I'll use my cordless drill for that. Otherwise it's a good mixer! Especially for the price - $20 - and especially given that more
[17:26:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  expensive models are no better, or even much worse.)
[17:27:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> After extensive research it really does seem like no amount of money spent on a product in this category will get me anything resembling substantially improved quality and reliability.
[17:27:26] <nshepperd2> tragic
[17:29:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Needless to say, all the recommendations - by the Wirecutter, and by Serious Eats too - are worthless. For instance they recommend the Breville Handy Mix Scraper - a $140!!! device! - and completely ignore the legions of reviewers who post photos where the plastic coating/shell of the beater attachments crack and flake off bits of plastic into your food.)

[17:31:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, my mixer of choice remains the Black & Decker MX3000W, as per my Recommended Kitchen Tools page
[17:32:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not perfect but it's fine. (Heck, at $20, you can buy three...)
[17:33:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... or maybe you can't buy even one because it stopped being available between four days ago and now???

[17:35:39] <nshepperd2> until it's gone entirely
[17:36:02] <nshepperd2> maybe the actual answer is 3d printed aftermarket parts for cordless drills to make them into decent mixers
[17:36:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[17:36:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's a funny thing: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JTS2GN7
[17:36:37] <Robomot> Amazon.com: KitchenAid KHM6118ER 6 Speed Hand Mixer with Flex Edge Beaters: Home & Kitchen (Online Shopping for Kitchen Small Appliances from a great selection of Coffee Machines, Blenders, Juicers, Ovens, Specialty Appliances, & more at everyday low prices)
[17:36:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> So this one is from KitchenAid, but it *clearly* has the *exact same* plastic-coated beater attachments as the Breville
[17:37:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody manufacturers their own shit anymore!
[17:37:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> -r
[17:37:49] <nshepperd2> from the same factory in shenzhen, i assume
[17:38:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed :\
[17:39:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Speaking of KitchenAid, let's just note the *stunningly bad* design here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6m0c4pjw901r7o6/Screen%20Shot%202022-01-05%20at%209.08.59%20AM.png?dl=0

[17:40:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> So there is a pair of plastic-molded buttons, up-down, which you use to adjust mixer speed. They have a hard plastic divider in the middle, so you can't (a complaint of reviewers) easily push them with the soft part of your thumb - you have to angle down awkwardly with your thumbtip.
[17:41:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> This plus a digital display is the replacement for a simple rotary switch like on most mixers - why??
[17:41:23] <nshepperd2> lmao
[17:41:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then to actually engage the mixer, you have a toggle switch which goes *left-right*
[17:41:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which you also have to use the very same thumb for
[17:42:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> While holding the damn mixer with that hand
[17:42:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why left-right??? The natural direction is obviously forward-back, in that position! Like every other mixer, again!
[17:42:34] <nshepperd2> lmao the digital display is left-right corresponding to the power switch and not the speed buttons
[17:42:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes!
[17:42:44] <nshepperd2> even though it shows speed
[17:42:49] <nshepperd2> ridiculous
[17:43:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> They concocted this ludicrous design which managed to fuck up pretty much every possible aspect of what was a perfectly straightforward and working UI
[17:43:23] <nshepperd2> never has so much third user been concentrated in one place
[17:43:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed :|
[17:44:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The reason for this, by the way, is evidently so that they can re-use the components in their 5, 7, and 9 speed models, changing only the speed display and the speeds printed on the plastic shell around it)
[17:44:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Why this requires making it dumb in all the other ways, we may never know)
[17:50:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Anyway, as for repurposing cordless drills, there are a couple of problems, unfortunately (though as I've noted, they do work in a pinch):
[17:51:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. Drills can apply more torque than a hand mixer, but their top speed is lower. Good for bread dough, not great for e.g. egg foams. (Perhaps a Dremel would work? But that might be *too* fast...)
[17:52:15] <kiboneu> good morning
[17:52:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Drills (very reasonably, due to safety concerns) require you to hold the trigger button down - let go, the drill stops. But for a mixer this gets tiring quickly; again, not great for longer jobs (once again, egg foams, or creaming butter, etc.)
[17:53:28] <kiboneu> dremel i have can vary in speed and doesn't require holding down
[17:53:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. A drill has just the single rotating element; a hand mixer has two counter-rotating ones. This makes a big difference.
[17:53:43] <kiboneu> but it has wood and metal dust on it, who knows with what coatings....
[17:54:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu: Well, you'd be inserting an attachment from the hand mixer
[17:54:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yes you can vary the speed, but e.g. my dremel's lowest speed is 5k rpm, I think? Not sure that's slow enough. Might be! I haven't checked
[17:54:41] <kiboneu> yeah that could work but my levels of disgust mixing eating and non-eating equipment gets passed
[17:55:05] <kiboneu> oh yeah mine i 5k min
[17:55:33] <kiboneu> add a gearbox :P
[17:55:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[17:55:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean at this point the solution starts to be "build your own mixer"
[17:55:55] <kiboneu> yeah

[18:20:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Buddhist enlightenment is breaking your brain until you stop perceiving the world in a normal/correct manner
[18:20:46] <pompolic> "like lucid dreaming" in what way exactly?
[18:20:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And instead begin to have various absurd ideas (and just generally become incapable of thinking functionally)

[18:21:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu: ... lol

[18:25:27] <badsektor> i dont meditate but i dont think it can be harmful, when you meditate you just try to train yourself to be aware of yourself as a separate thing, so you dissociate from yourself, like you learn to take yourself less seriously as a real thing, or something
[18:25:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Let's see: "write his own IRC client" - check, of course. "plan his own network infra" - yep, totally. "crimp his own cable" - sure can. "build out a server rack" - admittedly it's been many years and my current place hardly has space for any racks, but I don't recall this being hard. "write a shell script" - shell sucks and I prefer to script in PHP but I could if I really had to. "set up his own monitoring / alert system" -
[18:25:38] <Obormot\Arcturus>  never approached this in a serious fashion but I know the basics and could level up if need be. "configure a firewall" - certainly. "diagnose with ping and tr" - yep. "quell lusers" - nearly-decade support/service veteran. "RTFM" - lol. "reverse engineer" - this one I've not really done. "fashion a tor node etc." - probably not, 8086 parts sound scary.

[18:25:38] <Obormot\Arcturus>  "spam filter / auto reply" - duh. "microwave pizza" - I object to this on principle)

[21:16:09] <two2thehead> "The effect size was moderated also by the total duration of the intervention, to the advantage of longer interventions, and by the type of gameplay: games had a greater effect on math anxiety reduction when they promoted collaborative and social interactions. Such features were only present in non-digital games, while all the digital games analysed were single-player. In the final section of the paper, we discuss future possible research 
[21:16:10] <two2thehead> directions. The weak results obtained indicated the need to develop and test games explicitly designed for math anxious students. This will require the investigation of the relationship between game features and math anxiety through the analysis of the behaviour of anxious and non-anxious students at play. Among the features that an anxiety-aware game could employ, we suggest collaborative gameplay, social interactions, adaptability, features

[21:31:08] <gwern> that might be partially because #lesswrong has no particular project. we're just a watercooler, really
[21:31:20] <kuudes> yes
[21:31:57] <PapuaHardyNet> there are a few channels under the drew umbrella, really
[21:32:29] <PapuaHardyNet> there's #cmpwn, the main drew devault channel, there's #sr.ht, the sourcehut channel, there's #aerc, which I believe he stopped joining after a while
[21:32:39] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[21:32:45] <PapuaHardyNet> there's ##sr.ht.pub, which is a more of a watercooler
[21:33:34] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, a lot of my criticism is specific to #cmpwn. #sr.ht necessarily had to focus on sourcehut itself. off topic usually would go to one of the more general channels
[21:33:49] <PapuaHardyNet> there are more channels I don't remember

[21:45:35] <two2thehead> they should rename it 'LeLabia'

[21:46:58] <PapuaHardyNet> "This genus was named after the human clitoris, for the flowers bear a resemblance to the vulva." named aptly, I think

[21:55:00] <ggreer> kuudes: I wonder what would happen if other pathogens were scrutinized so closely. my guess is that we'd have similar studies (though not to the same degree, of course)
[21:55:35] <ggreer> everyone I know IRL who got covid recovered fully. old, young, vaccinated, not vaccinated... all of them. it was basically the flu for them
[21:55:42] <gwern> kuudes: I don't buy it. "one man's modus ponens". all these studies play fast and loose with symptom count and self-report

[21:56:09] <gwern> kuudes: and the better studies like the soccer study find real but far smaller effects than his hyperventilating about 'half of patients' or 'third of patients' etc
[21:56:43] <kuudes> hmm, ok. thanks
[21:56:51] <two2thehead> gwern, btw, what did you mean when you said yesterday that 'my relatives are sick like i told them'?
[21:57:12] <two2thehead> were they not vaccinated and you advised them to vaccinate or...?
[21:57:13] <gwern> I mean exactly tat. that regardless of testing, if we gathered all 20-30 of us, a lot of them would get sick
[21:57:20] <gwern> regardless of testing or vaccination
[21:57:22] <two2thehead> ah
[21:57:41] <gwern> so this is just me telling them, 'don't you dare act surprised now that it's time to pay the piper. you thought it was worthwhile. so, pay the price.'
[21:58:07] <two2thehead> "When it comes to housing, it might be better to think about the U.S. as a country of 384 metro areas (plus 50 million Americans who don't live in places big enough to qualify as a metro area) rather than one continuous country."
[21:58:44] <two2thehead> gwern, did you cackle manically while wearing a hazmat suit? I find that a good cackle always gets the message across
[21:58:47] <gwern> ie. soccer players have a performance drop of, what was it, ~5%? after infection. whereas if you listened to this guy, you'd think half the country was going to be confined to bed for the rest of their life replaying _Ethan Frome_
[21:59:45] <gwern> two2thehead: no. I just participated like normal. with so many people around for so long in such confined spaces, a mask was pointless, and I didn't think the risk bad enough to torpedo the entire holiday especially given how many firsts/lasts this one may represent
[21:59:54] <ggreer> I assumed I would get omicron covid during christmas or new years. I'm honestly amazed I didn't (or was asymptomatic)
[22:00:32] <gwern> I was really surprised no one did while they were here, but omicron lived up to my faith in it and got them all on the way out, it seems
[22:00:34] <two2thehead> I think a good cackle can make all the difference. Please add it to your to do list :V

[23:09:10] <kuudes> over here we are getting again a fight between health ministry which is for putting schools to remote and closing down most everything, and health institute, which is for putting kids to schools and shortening quarantines and raising criteria for them
[23:09:44] <two2thehead> what's the full dose (ie not boostered) percentage?
[23:09:56] <kuudes> kids are basicly unvaxxed
[23:10:07] <two2thehead> hm
[23:10:12] <kuudes> because they only allowed 5-11 year olds to get a vaccine in 2021-12-23 onward
[23:10:22] <kuudes> the health institute banned it before
[23:10:28] <pompolic> two_buttons_sweating_man.png
[23:10:38] <two2thehead> sounds relatively easy to fix
[23:10:46] <kuudes> it feels to me that this is a fight between zerocoviders and greatbarringtoners
[23:11:06] <two2thehead> I remember when the elderly were at risk of not getting enough vaccinations
[23:11:08] <two2thehead> bad times
[23:11:32] <kuudes> mind you that they allowed the children's vaccinations with wording which effectively bans centralized school vaccinations
[23:11:44] <kuudes> it is allowed if both parents insist, sort of
[23:12:22] <pompolic> interesting
[23:12:24] <kuudes> but officials are not allowed to organize vaccination drives and offer opt-outs
[23:12:40] <pompolic> finally some good policy
[23:12:43] <kuudes> specific permission slip needs to be signed by both parents
[23:12:50] <kuudes> how so?
[23:13:05] <pompolic> oh i'm mostly shitposting in the veins of "officials shouldn't be allowed to do anything"
[23:13:07] <kuudes> wouldn't it have been better to just vaccinate all kids in daycares and schools a month ago?
[23:13:21] <kuudes> like, in the classroom all the kids are present and sitting in an orderly spot
[23:13:31] <kuudes> so you would just need 2 persons going classroom by classroom

[23:13:53] <two2thehead> hm. quite possible, now that you've mentioned it
[23:13:53] <kuudes> and the teachers would then supervise the 15 minute "no one drops unconscious" period while normally teaching
[23:14:02] <pompolic> it's almost as if the downsides of concentrating and locking up people for the majority of the day have been consistently undersold
[23:14:09] <two2thehead> plus the kids are probably used to getting health check ups every year
[23:15:18] <kuudes> but it seems to me the health institute is strongly for "everyone has the duty to get infected now, so that the exceptional circumstances cease"
[23:15:20] <pompolic> less obtusely: even aside my moral outrage for schoolings' existence, they do seem like disease incubators, but i don't think adding more centralized management is going to fix it
[23:15:34] <pompolic> schools' existence*
[23:19:05] <two2thehead> pompolic, wait, are you saying that 'centralized management' (whatever definition of the term) is bad or that vaccination-in-schools is bad? because one is a lot more likely to have measurable benefits than the other

[23:25:27] <pompolic> seems like the policy is "you can get your kid vaccinated, but it's not the school responsibility"
[23:25:37] <pompolic> mostly a joke answer but i feel like i actually had some thought behind it
[23:25:55] <pompolic> and now i'm trying to figure out what i actually meant
[23:26:38] <pompolic> some of it really is "reeeee stop mandating things"

[23:32:36] <kuudes> here it is the duty of parents to put kids to school
[23:32:45] <kuudes> parents can be fined and kids taken into custody in extreme
[23:33:23] <kuudes> children have duty of education; it can be managed by home schooling, but then it needs to be shown to local headmaster that the education progresses at pace required
[23:34:07] <kuudes> I am glad they made an exception that allowed kids who have people in risk groups in their families to be exempted from school
[23:34:13] <kuudes> but still no right to remote education
[23:34:23] <pompolic> alas
[23:34:27] <ggreer> it's all pretty stupid. a 20 year old female with one shot is at about the same risk as me (a 36 year old male with a booster). and both of us are at much lower risk than say... a 50 year old
[23:34:55] <kuudes> as that is banned by law for kids in lower than 4th grade, unless the kid itself is in quarantine or isolation per official test confirmed and infectious disease doctor ordered quarantine

[23:36:22] <ggreer> here in the US it differs by region. some cities are super paranoid. others are back to normal. vancouver is a weird mix of restrictions imposed by the state and lack of enforcement because the area is more conservative than the state government (which is basically controlled by seattle)
[23:36:28] <pompolic> >curve flattened on the Y axis
[23:36:31] <pompolic> i love this phrase
[23:36:39] <kuudes> I see we have two options: 1) society stops because people are at home vomiting 2) society stops because people are at home avoiding other people
[23:37:19] <kuudes> in any case, my family is at home avoiding other people
[23:37:34] <kuudes> in case remote learning is allowed, I guess my older kid will get at least school

[23:38:27] <kuudes> oh yeah in usa they are idiots, wasn't it?
[23:38:54] <ggreer> because people can't hear him through a mask. also he's probably vaccinated and recovered from covid
[23:39:10] <kuudes> omicron does not care for past infections though
[23:39:20] <kuudes> 5-6 vaccine doses could maybe prevent omicron infections
[23:39:55] <ggreer> I'd rather get omicron than get more boosters. each booster is 2 days out of commission. it's brutal
[23:40:26] <ggreer> for people who tolerate the vaccines better, I can see them preferring the opposite
[23:42:40] <kuudes> with current information I agree that is a possible preference and I think you are correct for holding that decision to yourself
[23:43:02] <kuudes> if there are mandatory vaccinations, I am unsure if there are still reasons for more doses than 1 to be mandatory
[23:43:04] <ggreer> it looks like this disease is going to be around forever. it doesn't look like the bureaucracies will allow variant-specific boosters to be created in time to matter, so what else is there to do? I'm not going to live my life like a hermit
[23:43:15] <kuudes> but I think the covid passport thingy seems bad for freedoms in general
[23:43:29] <ggreer> just like original passports which were a "temporary" measure
[23:43:33] <kuudes> mandatory vaccine injections are less freedom harming than widespread discrimination
[23:44:12] <kuudes> I hold it possible that there would be mandatory boosters, if indeed we can get reasonable presumption that such would stop the local spread of disease
[23:44:32] <kuudes> ie with measles it seems to me that I would accept mandatory measles vaccination
[23:44:43] <kuudes> because that allows us to be free of local spread of measles
[23:44:59] <kuudes> we don't currently have mandatory vaccines in that though, as it has been achieved so far with voluntary doses
[23:45:35] <kuudes> for delta, it seemed to me that mandatory 3 dosed covid vaccination could be reasonable, as it would have stopped local spread
[23:45:51] <ggreer> are measles vaccines mandatory? in the US most schools require them before they'll let the student attend, though there are various religious objections and medical exemptions that are allowed
[23:46:01] <kuudes> over here iirc no vaccine is mandatory
[23:46:21] <kuudes> but there is free pre- and postnatal care where they are strongly nudged to
[23:46:35] <kuudes> ie if you are a really adamant antivaxxer, they won't force them
[23:46:51] <kuudes> but sort of opt-out
[23:47:25] <kuudes> pre- and postnatal care is not mandatory, but you lose your eligibility to mother package if you opt-out
[23:47:50] <kuudes> which is worth something around 300 e in baby supplies

[23:49:31] <kuudes> but we indeed have the option for an executive order by the cabinet for enforced vaccination of all or part of population against a generally dangerous contagious disease with some specifit attributes, which covid and measles have
[23:49:39] <kuudes> but so far they have not made such an EO
