[17:09:15] <Reeson>  In Django (rest framework)/React app, what would be the best way to implement a guest user, so he can also perform CRUD operations (with limitations)? As I understand, you need token authentication which is fine if you're a registered (is_active = True) user, but what about if you want people to try you app before they register, and later on they
[17:09:15] <Reeson> can convert their "guest account" into registered one by Signing up?
[17:11:35] <doismellburning> Reeson: I'd probably look at using session storage explicitly
[17:11:48] <doismellburning> Reeson: then copying that over to account data at registration or something
[17:12:15] <doismellburning> Reeson: I suspect/assume there's a library for this but I couldn't point at one off the top of my head I'm afraid
[17:16:57] <Reeson> But how can you authenticate a guest user? I mean, if you have CRUD oparetions which require token in the request's header, that's fine if you're a registerd user....
[17:17:19] <doismellburning> Reeson: wait, what do you mean "authenticate a guest user"?
[17:18:05] <doismellburning> Oh, you actually mean a _long-lasting_ guest account, and not like e.g. the "add items to my shopping basket without auth, then checkout as guest / register / login to complete"?
[17:18:56] <Reeson> hold on..let me paste the function tthat I made to create a "guest" user
[17:19:14] <Reeson> Here: https://dpaste.org/v6ce
[17:19:54] <Reeson> I also have a post_save signal which creates a token when a "guest" user is created
[17:20:49] <doismellburning> Can you elaborate more about the UX you want?
[17:21:15] <doismellburning> You actually want them to be able to return and reauthenticate, if I understand correctly, but without an actual signup experience?
[17:22:04] <doismellburning> Do you actually want "signup" (quick, easy, they provide an email, you e.g. email them a password for next time) and "full account unlock" (with more details and verification etc.)?
[17:22:29] <Reeson> No quite...let me explain in more detail
[17:25:21] <Reeson> So, I have this Django/React app where registered users can create/edit/delete tasks and edit their profiles with token authentication. I want the guest users to be also able to perform the same CRUD operations, but without accessing the profile page, and only to be able to create of maximum 10 tasks (for example)
[17:27:39] <Reeson> Before this project, I had the same app made ONLY with Django and it was working fine, since there was no token auth. involved
[17:33:54] <doismellburning> If you had it working, it's not clear to me what problem you're having working now?
[17:34:03] <doismellburning> *having getting it working now?

[17:38:07] <duoi> Reeson you can create tokens for that particular user
[17:38:08] <Reeson> Now I'm doing the same app, but with rest framework and React. And as I understand you need to be authorized right? So when you create a task for example, a token needs to be passed along, otherwise how would Django know which user is creating a task.
[17:38:23] <duoi> the syntax is something to the effect of Token.objects.create(user=user)
[17:38:28] <doismellburning> Reeson: the same way it did beforehand
[17:38:51] <duoi> you can then set that token in a cookie with response.set_cookie({"token": Token.objects.create(user=user))
[17:38:59] <duoi> and just look for that value in your frontend
[17:40:08] <duoi> if you want to "promote" the account later it really depends on implementation, you could set a boolean on the user model to indicate its a trial user or something and then just change that when you're ready to promote them

[17:45:25] <Reeson> I mean, I guess, but as a guest user, your "is_acive" field is set to False, only when you register and click on activation link, then it's set to True. When I tried to get a "guest" user with this view: https://dpaste.org/ieLm  I got error saying: "User inactive or deleted.", which is what to be expected
[17:47:46] <Reeson> As you said, a workaround would be to have an additiona bool field "is_guest = True" and as soon a guest is created, its "is_active" would be set to True, and later on when they register and click on activation link, the "is_guest" would be set to False

[21:52:55] <T-101> I'm fiddling with django permissions in DRF, DjangoModelPermissions works fine for me but I got into thinking that could it be done so that it is more reusable. so I wouldn't have to override it for every model separately? a working solution and my best attempt after it here https://dpaste.org/MXou

[22:03:47] <knbk> T-101: you can create a function that takes the model name and returns a new subclass. You can just use `class ...` inside the function and return it
[22:07:41] <T-101> ah yes, once again too close to the problem. works like a charm now :) thx knbk

[23:07:38] <shangxiao> hm I found the issue, was using -d for curl instead of --data-binary
[23:08:02] <shangxiao> curl sets the content length header and it looks like django or whatever is just cropping to that length
