[00:45:14] <qrpnxz> non-free has always been unofficial afaik. If you go to downloads page, they are called unofficial. To "install debian" means to install from the main repo. https://www.debian.org/download
[00:45:19] <Noisytoot> vitali64[m]: Any distro that includes nonfree software is (at least partially) nonfree
[00:45:50] <msiism> qrpnxz: I'm not talking about ISO images, I'm talking about https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#the-non-free-archive-area.

[00:46:36] <qrpnxz> as you can see, it "packages intended to work with the debian distribution" of which non-free isn't a part of
[00:47:29] <msiism> So, how is this unofficial if Debian maintainers are packaging these things up and signing them with Debian's package signing key?
[00:47:41] <msiism> Looks pretty official to me.
[00:47:50] <msiism> And I'm also okay with that.
[00:49:06] <qrpnxz> hey, that's a good point, but I do think calling it unofficial side option also counts for something
[00:49:33] <msiism> I'm not sure. But it also doesn't matter much.
[00:49:40] <qrpnxz> if you install from dvd i think you won't be able to get any non-free to start and you have to add non-free repo manually
[00:50:08] <msiism> You can do it using the expert install mode.
[00:50:27] <qrpnxz> an expert is a well informed person, so that seem okay to me

[00:53:33] <msiism> vitali64[m]: You could check out some Linux-libre system.
[00:53:37] <Noisytoot> vitali64[m]: macOS contains some free software (XNU, Darwin, some GNU software) and some nonfree software (drivers, lots of other stuff). Many GNU+Linux distributions also contain some free software (Linux, GNU coreutils, glibc) and some nonfree software (such as possibly nonfree drivers and firmware). They both contain both free and nonfree software, and are so both (as a whole) nonfree.

[00:56:19] <qrpnxz> oh
[00:56:29] <qrpnxz> because non-free means you don't have all 4 freedoms

[00:56:39] <qrpnxz> then you don't have all of them

[00:56:52] <k0tyk[m]> Anything can only be as free as its most unfree part is
[00:56:54] <msiism> I'm not sure that's exactly non-free then.
[00:57:22] <qrpnxz> 80% better than 0% no doubt, but it's not strictly free because you don't have full freedom

[01:03:30] <kompowiec2> the article he wrote here is about gish gallop, I wonder if stallman is aware of it.
[01:03:35] <qrpnxz> i don't think it's a mix-up, it's better
[01:03:36] <nrg> Not for links, though.
[01:03:53] <msiism> Better? I find it utterly annyoing, to be honest.
[01:04:36] <msiism> It's like reading a book which occasinally use a different type face.
[01:04:56] <qrpnxz> it's only slightly different for links, which are always slightly different
[01:05:09] <msiism> Yeah, but not in type face.
[01:05:17] <qrpnxz> it is for me https://a.tmp.ninja/VoNRKZFi.png
[01:05:19] <msiism> You just don't do that.
[01:05:27] <msiism> Make it all Comic Sans, okay.
[01:05:33] <msiism> but then also make links Comic Sans.
[01:05:42] <qrpnxz> ?
[01:06:00] <qrpnxz> it's just good ol dejavu serif vs dejavu sans
[01:06:04] <nrg> Links in Comic Sans, normal text in Papyrus.
[01:06:10] <qrpnxz> it's less difference than even using bold or italic
[01:06:10] <msiism> :)
[01:06:46] <msiism> qrpnxz: Inline links in hypertext should should simply be underline and different in color, preferably a shade of blue.
[01:07:12] <msiism> And visited links should have a somewhat "faded" color, e.g., simply greyish.
[01:07:26] <qrpnxz> underline text is among the least legible, scientifically studied so lol
[01:07:39] <qrpnxz> i like the subtle underlines of gnu.org
[01:07:50] <msiism> Yeah, okay, I'd be interested in that study.
[01:08:04] <msiism> Or those studies.
[01:08:30] <msiism> Not underlining links surely makes them harder to find.
[01:08:37] <qrpnxz> i did a whole course on communications, and we learned underline is rather bad, and i believe all caps is the worse.
[01:09:34] <qrpnxz> the all cap thing can be brought up in court for notices even. MPL is well written so it uses bold and boxes to do prominent warranty notice instead of the traditional misguided all caps
[01:09:53] <msiism> Well, I've never done a course on communications, but I read a lot of web pages.
[01:10:23] <msiism> In my experience, not underlining links is mostly bad, except for things like Wikipedia, where there are a lot of links.
[01:10:32] <msiism> And I'm not the only peron I know who thinks that way.

[01:10:44] <msiism> But sure, others might have a different take on this.
[01:11:09] <nrg> I don't care, as long as they stand out.
[01:11:40] <qrpnxz> i think underline is fairly acceptable for links for basically two reason: 1) links are usually rather sparse in a text so it's not a big deal (having a few words in all caps is not a big deal either); 2) you can CSS tweak that underline for links in a lot of ways so that it's more separated and subtle and doesn't mess with reading so much.
[01:12:09] <msiism> And there is one other reason pro underlining.
[01:12:31] <msiism> Undelrining is rarely found in printed works these days because it's not necessary for anyhting.
[01:12:47] <msiism> so it's free to denote something that goes beyond plaintext, which in this case, is hyperlinks.
[01:12:57] <qrpnxz> underlining is a typewriter hack, it wasn't part of print at all before that
[01:13:00] <nrg> Or is it because people tried clicking their books and magazines?

[01:13:45] <qrpnxz> nah, it just is not a print practice. Emphasis should be bold or italic.
[01:13:51] <msiism> Right.
[01:14:20] <msiism> Thorugh we do have text marker now.
[01:14:23] <qrpnxz> i think there's some handwritten underline notation for editing annotations, but that's about it

[22:15:30] <jacobk> What "free" means when it comes to operating systems is a bit confusing, because many programs are part of the operating system and it's not clear where the boundaries are.

[22:16:11] <isf> maybe exist a confusing issue. here the difinition:
[22:16:12] <isf> Free distributions (or “distros”) of the GNU/Linux system only include and only propose free software. They reject nonfree applications, nonfree programming platforms, nonfree drivers, nonfree firmware “blobs,” and any other nonfree software and documentation. If they discover that by mistake some had been included, they remove it.

[22:16:32] <jacobk> I think it makes sense to say a operating system is nonfree if it includes nonfree software in its installer image, at least.
[22:17:03] <isf> other points of view, can be and normaly are attacks against the objetive
[22:17:14] <Andrew> isf: I use a nonfree distro with exclusively free software, aka Gentoo with ACCEPT_LICENSE

[22:17:21] <isf> of the free software movement, that is all software must be free as in freedom
[22:17:22] <kompowiec2> isf, The world doesn't end with an FSF approved distros. Debian or gentoo have only free software in default. 
[22:17:33] <primalmotion> (oops)
[22:17:43] <isf> no no, that distros dont have the goal of the movement of the free software
[22:17:49] <kompowiec2> and are not approved for philosophical, not technical reasons only.
[22:17:53] <isf> so, are propietary becouse recommend, and share nonfree software
[22:17:55] <jacobk> I think "free" cannot mean "FSDG", because the FSDG has so many requirements that don't directly have to do with freedom.
[22:18:28] <jacobk> e.g. "The distro must contain"..."no spyware"
[22:18:36] <isf> so, who have a other point of view, are trying to justify as a well thing share and recommend nonfree software?
[22:18:41] <isf> all nonfree software are malware
[22:18:44] <isf> and spyware
[22:18:59] <jacobk> Spyware is bad so the FSF should not recommend spyware, but libre spyware is not an attack on freedom (at least not directly)
[22:19:08] *** \ is now known as backslash
[22:19:23] <isf> that's can be a justification for run nonfree software
[22:19:26] <isf> cant*

[22:19:50] <isf> that is attack against the objetive of the free software movement
[22:19:58] <isf> traditional issue from opensource people
[22:20:05] <isf> becouse they dont care about the objetive

[22:21:29] <Andrew> Debian doesn't care? lol
[22:21:42] <kompowiec2> <isf> so, who have a other point of view, are trying to justify as a well thing share and recommend nonfree software?
[22:21:43] <kompowiec2> Absolutely not. It's just about maintaining a certain balance and objectivity. The fact that the distribution does not behave as FSDG wants it does not exclude that it does not include non-free software.
[22:21:51] <isf> the real pragmatic issue about free software is say no to nonfree software even when you have must do a technical sacrifice
[22:22:16] <isf> but, a lot people here dont want the objetive, and run nonfree distros who share with them the nonfree software they want for their confort

[22:23:24] <kompowiec2> just because a given distribution does differently does not justify it in any way.
[22:23:32] <isf> becouse that distros attack the objetive promoting, distributiing nonfree software
[22:23:53] <isf> that is a literal attack to the goal of the free software movement
[22:23:57] <Andrew> isf: Let's go ahead and introduce all newbies to Trisquel, and when they discover they can't run malware required by work, teach them freedom and "get a better job"?

[22:24:18] <leah> Andrew: you told me to come here
[22:24:20] <leah> why?
[22:24:20] <kompowiec2> it's like Russia's attack on Ukraine. The fact that Russia has its mentality does not justify them in any way for what they did.

[22:28:08] <zleap> TW?
[22:28:09] <leah> they do this by: not promoting sam zeloof, jeri ellsworth and libre silicon's work, and by instead continuing to keep the ryf program intact, which specifically has the "secondary processor" exemption

[22:29:06] <notdaniel> My biggest frustration with the free hardware thing is it drives so many people to just use old hardware
[22:29:09] <leah> that page i linked shows everything wrong with fsf

[22:29:19] <leah> https://osboot.org/news/policy.html#problems-with-fsdg
[22:29:42] <leah> fsdg in particular is problematic. they are steering people away from good projects that actually make a huge difference
[22:29:56] <leah> projects such as openbsd, which gave us... openbsd. and also openssh and libressl
[22:29:57] <notdaniel> Yeah
[22:30:06] <jacobk> "freetard" seems kinda sanist tbh
[22:30:06] <jacobk> "toejam witness" seems like a better word to me, even though I'm not sure of the etymology
[22:30:21] <Andrew> leah: yay thanks!
[22:30:46] <leah> (also, they have a zero nda policy. unlike linux/gnu which accept NDA'd code gladly. openbsd insists on specs for hardware, and they write drivers themselves, rather than submitting to large companies that want to take over the movement, as they already have done. see: corporate ownership of linux and gcc!)

[22:32:17] <leah> (i'm not the author of that last article, but i agree with 95% of it. it's what turned me away from copyleft, during the last year as i thought about it)

[22:33:36] <leah> jacobk: see: jehovas witness. TWs have the same pedantic behaviour as them, but with software
[22:34:09] <Andrew> OBSD's reasons of using permissive licensing is because they think copyleft makes companies with commercial interests turn away

[22:40:20] <leah> Andrew: that's the problem with fanatics, of any kind. as soon as you challenge them, they close their ears
[22:40:33] <Andrew> leah: Yup, lol
[22:40:35] <leah> i challenged isf's core beliefs and the reason i'm now on ignore is because i actually convinced him
[22:40:39] <isf> i dont want explain 
[22:40:42] <leah> but he doesn't want his faith shaken
[22:40:48] <isf> english suck for it for me
[22:40:50] <Andrew> leah: I don't care about attribution, so I go PD
[22:40:58] <leah> if this were a jw church, i'd be called a satanist
[22:40:59] <Andrew> isf: Explain it in your native language
[22:41:00] <leah> lol
[22:41:18] * leah is not a jw, but knows about them, and has befriended a few in the past

[22:41:57] <leah> those annoying people that show up at your door talking about how we're all going to die
[22:42:19] <zleap> and you can't easily get rid of them
[22:42:37] <leah> i invited them in once. because i was curious. what those people believe in and promote is basically fascism
[22:42:58] <Andrew> odd stuff
[22:43:19] <leah> they're scary people. and they use all kinds of gaslighting and emotional manipulation to try to assimilate you into their cult
[22:43:25] <leah> they're no different than scientologists
[22:43:57] <zleap> yeah cults really know how to draw you in and keep you
[22:44:07] <leah> and TWs behave in the same way
[22:44:12] <leah> same thought pattern
[22:44:20] <zleap> what is TW

[22:45:54] <isf> nunca hay garantía en nada, en absoluto. Una licencia de software libre es una herramienta que funciona bajo el monopolio legal del uso de la fuerza, es decir el estado.
[22:46:13] <Andrew> isf: Unlicensed works contain no-license and public domain works

[22:51:15] <leah> music to install openbsd to
[22:51:23] <jacobk> I finished reading "The problems with the GPL" and I mostly disagree. I think the point about the GPL encouraging companies to "hijack" free software is interesting, but I think the GPL has been very useful before (C++ in GCC is an example of this, right?), and I think the freedom to restrict others' freedom is not a valid freedom.
[22:51:23] <jacobk> I would prefer is copyright simply didn't cover software though.

[22:52:44] <jxself> But it does and until/unless the day arrives that people stop using copyright to restrict people in that way, the GPL seems an effective defense.

[23:05:22] <kompowiec2> I never didn't find any wrong ideological / philosophical components inherent in the free software itself. Only sometimes I have doubts about the applied ethics i.e. practice
[23:07:17] <kompowiec2> and although I usually manage to find the answer to them myself, sometimes I prefer to ask for the opinion of others.
