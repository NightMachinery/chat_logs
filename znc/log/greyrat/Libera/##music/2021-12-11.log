[20:48:54] <nativetexan> you can probably find a 2000 or 1000 series used pretty cheap

[20:49:19] <nativetexan> i'm using a 1000 series myself a 1080TI

[20:51:43] <artao> it's an older card but still quite capable

[20:51:49] <artao> the 1080
[20:51:50] <nativetexan> but i'm gonna game it until i wear the tires off it
[20:51:57] <artao> :D
[20:52:17] <artao> i'll sometimes hear the fans on the GPU if i'm REALLY crankin it

[20:55:28] <nativetexan> on back4blood i set it at 75fps because my monitor is 75hz and it holds great, kf2 i get 60fps and never anymore no matter what i do, like i said far cry 6 is at 1080p and i get about 50fps average
[20:55:56] <nativetexan> older games are no problem
[20:56:04] <nativetexan> like csgo i get over 200fps

[20:56:21] <murthy> nativetexan: is vsync turned off in kf?
[20:56:57] <nativetexan> kf2 is just what is...60fps no matter how many settings i change

[21:01:31] <artao> there's several "wars" going on at once all the time
[21:01:49] <artao> of course, you have to either grind or pay to be a general. it's free to play, but not quite pay to win
[21:02:07] <nativetexan> far cry 6 has female troops, which kinda freaked me out
[21:02:09] <artao> that said, you do have a to grind a lot to advance. thankfully, it's a fun FPS

[21:52:06] <artao> ice dams can be trisksy that way tho. there one day gone the next
[21:52:31] <murthy> artao: why were they called?
[21:52:35] <artao> there's such a thing as too much insulation
[21:52:44] <artao> cuz  a neighbor was getting drips from the ceiling or something
[21:52:51] <artao> which i've also had before
[21:53:17] <artao> too much insulation traps too much moisture, then the attic gets cold and that moisture condnses and starts dripping
[21:53:36] <artao> it can be hard to find if you're not up there as it's happening
