[01:30:49] <Jacques> Hi guys, I'm doing an exercise and I want a nudge in the right direction. I want to prove: I(V(y - x^2, z - x^3))  = <y - x^2, z - x^3>. that is, the ideal of a variety is equal to the ideal of its generators.
[01:30:50] <Jacques> Right now I would like to prove the direction I(V) is a subset of the ideal <y - x^2, z - x^3>.
[01:30:50] <Jacques> So, I want to show an element of I(V) = {f in R[x,y,z] : f(a) = 0}, where a = (a1, a2, a3) in the (affine) variety V, is contained in the ideal <y - x^2, z - x^3>. That means I need to show that any element of I(V) can be written like: h_1 * ( y - x^2) + h_2 * (z - x^3), where h1 and h2 are in R[x,y,z]. But I am having trouble figuring out how to
[01:30:51] <Jacques> start this off. Can anyone help?
[01:33:54] <river> is I(V(X)) = X always true?

Let g in I(V(y - x^2, z - x^3)). Every polynomial in <y - x^2, z - x^3> is written as the sum: h_1 * (y-x^2) + h_2 * (z - x^3), where h_1, h_2 are in R[x,y,z]. Therefore, if g is NOT IN <y -

[02:41:14] <Fangs> if f is a poly in I(V(J)) such that for all p in V(J) we have f(p) = 0.. call that ring hom F.. then F(f) = 0?
[02:42:01] <Fangs> I'm not sure why that's true.. except for naively saying that R[t] is the ring of functions on V(J)
[02:45:18] <isekaijin> Let f : R^3 -> R be a polynomial that vanishes in V(J). That is, f(t, t^2, t^3) = 0 for every t \in R. Then, in fact, f(t, t^2, t^3) = 0 for every t \in C.

[02:48:17] <isekaijin> Okay, so we know that f is a C[x,y,z]-linear combination of y - x^2 and z - x^3. We only need to show that the coefficients of the linear combination can be taken in R[x,y,z].

[02:52:21] <isekaijin> Actually, we can kill either variable, y or z, one at a time.

[03:01:38] <isekaijin> Of course.
[03:02:15] <isekaijin> In the first phase where we kill z, the leading term w.r.t. the variable z might also contain a factor y^r.
[03:02:17] <Fangs> this exercise seems a bit harder than what you would expect for someone who just started reading about varieties and ideals (which seems to be the case for OP)
[03:02:23] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[03:02:36] <isekaijin> But I think I finally have the answer.
[03:03:42] <isekaijin> Let f_0 = f. Let f_{n+1} = f_n - g_n * (z - x^3), where g_n is a suitably chosen monomial that kills the leading term of f_n w.r.t. the variable z.

[05:37:26] <isekaijin> In p-adic analysis, do we also have a notion of “convergent power series”?
[05:39:13] <isekaijin> That is, if I take a formal power series f \in Q[[x]], do we have a p-adic ball around the 0 \in Q_p where f converges?
[05:39:33] <Galois> yes?????
[05:39:46] <isekaijin> Errr, f \in Q_p[[x]], but still.
[05:40:35] <isekaijin> Are there uses for this in analytic combinatorics? That is, has anyone ever considered “p-adic analytic combinatorics”?

[07:58:52] <MsPants> I'm telling you because I believe the reason I was banned from #programming is I rejected one of ops from #programming from Libera chat's high IQ society and they took offence to it
[07:59:03] <MsPants> and banned me and several other people

[08:09:25] <MsPants> PlanckWalk: Long story short, I implied several times that C++ was a leaky abstraction over string types in #programming several times and several people took offence to it ultimately culminating in *one* Op's decision to axe me from the channel despite my appeal to #programming-ops (most of them agreed there was no reason for the ban and I even
[08:09:25] <MsPants> had representation from #libera chat ops to moderate the meeting as it was a heated debate). I wasn't going to reveal the true motivation for my ban as I did not want to give away the existence of a secret high IQ society on Libera chat but since damage is done already I have no choice or recourse
[08:10:05] <Galois> you seem like you've been on IRC long enough to realize that one channel generally doesn't give a shit about another channel's drama
[08:10:22] <MsPants> the ultimate reason for my ban was a certain op's reject several weeks ago from Libera chat's high IQ society
[08:10:23] <PlanckWalk> Long story even shorter would be the empty string, and more relevant to ##math.
[08:10:39] <pavonia> :D
[08:12:56] <MsPants> Ok, well considering this society has several high level members of Libera chat as members let's just see what happens
[08:13:00] <kakuhen> alright let's make this about math again
[08:13:13] <kakuhen> so one of my friends is preparing for an algebra qual and we encountered the funniest red herring ever
[08:14:10] *** Joins: hex_ (~hex@1.39.188.93)
[08:14:20] <kakuhen> The question reads as follows:
[08:14:32] <kakuhen>  "Let C be the category of semi-symplectic topological quantum paramonoids of Rice-Paddy type, satisfying the Mussolini-Rostropovich equations at infinity. Let X, Y be objects of C such that the functors Mor_C(X,-) and Mor_C(Y,-) are isomorphic, as covariant functors from C to sets. Show that X and Y are isomorphic in C."
[08:14:57] <kakuhen> I swear half the words stated in the first half of the question do not even exist and only serve to scare people
[08:15:35] <kakuhen> and the real content is really "if Hom(X,-) = Hom(Y,-) then X=Y", which can be shown with Yoneda's lemma
[08:15:53] <kakuhen> but out of curisoity I decided to search up "paramonoids" and I landed at some preprint referencing a manuscript that is seemingly  nowhere

[10:33:08] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[10:33:33] <Fangs> that's how 'modular arithmetic' plays a role in number theory proper.. in maths you have a lot of application too. sometimes its hard to work with integers.. so you work with mod 2 and you don't have to worry about +/- signs
[10:35:09] <zeroc00l0> Okay, that's very interesting to me, thanks.  Are there some specific applications that you are interested in?
[10:36:22] <Fangs> I learnt some topology recently. this isn't so much an application but more of a 'consequence'. if you have a manifold, you sort of want to define this thing called 'orientation', with respect to some cohomology theory

[10:38:39] <Fangs> so sometimes people might work over 'mod p' instead of the integers. you *are* losing some information this way, but its better than not getting anywhere
[10:39:16] <zeroc00l0> Does the loss of information manifest as a weaker theorem? Or some other way
[10:40:19] <Fangs> I only know this very naively, but, in algebraic topology you have these 'algebraic invariants' you get from a space. generally speaking the integral information is usually what's the most 'informative' (naively speaking)

[10:52:48] <zeroc00l0> I sort of understand.  You want to show that some set is a group for whatever reason.  But this is hard, so instead you prove your result in some other group and show that the result applies to the original set?
[10:53:43] <Fangs> no, its not that I want to show some set is a group.. the "nth homology group" is always a group. you can think of it as a (higher order?) function that takes in a topological space and returns a group
[10:54:55] <zeroc00l0> Hmm, I was referring to this, I think: "but suppose I tried to compute this group, but its too hard"
[10:55:42] <Fangs> zeroc00l0: when you apply this 'function' you have to do it manually
[10:55:55] <Fangs> (or write a program and tell a computer to do it.. but thats hard too)
[10:56:38] <Fangs> so you know it'll always return a group (think a type-strict function that returns a group)
[10:56:51] <Fangs> just that your human brain might take too long to reasonably 'execute' the function
[10:56:56] <zeroc00l0> Ok, I'm following that.
[10:57:13] <Fangs> zeroc00l0: a possible example on why you might care about what the group is, is you might be able to say "since X's 3rd homology group is zero, and Y's isn't, there is no 'non-trivial map from X to Y"
[10:57:51] <zeroc00l0> When you say "computer this group" you are referring to applying the "nth homology group" to turn a topological space into a group.
[10:57:59] <Fangs> yeah
[10:58:08] <zeroc00l0> s/computer/compute

[11:00:35] <Fangs> zeroc00l0: I think this one is a rather nice concrete example: if a manifold has trivial/zero first homology group, then that space is orientable, and any 'vector bundles' over that space is always orientable
[11:01:05] <Fangs> (theres going to be some words that I wouldn't be able to motivate, but its something I might care about.. say)
[11:01:50] <Fangs> (also if there are experts secretly listening in.. I'm thinking of the result: first whitney class vanishes iff vector bundle is orientable)

[11:03:48] <Fangs> zeroc00l0: when you work with fields like Q or R or C, only those three factors survives, and everything else dies more less
[11:04:16] <Fangs> I think its fair to say that the 'rational' part is usually the easiest to compute.. just because you have so many tools to compute them with
[11:04:54] <zeroc00l0> What does it mean to "work with fields like ..."?
[11:05:13] <Fangs> do you remember calculus?
[11:05:21] <zeroc00l0> Yes, some of it.
[11:05:36] <Fangs> good enough. not going to ask you any calculus questions
[11:06:37] <Fangs> so the thing with computing homology (or cohomology) groups is that there are many 'version' of this theory. there's "Singular homology" vs "cellular homology" vs "simplicial homology" for example
[11:06:47] <Fangs> this is more or less getting into nitty gritty details
[11:07:30] <zeroc00l0> And homology groups are computed from spaces.
[11:07:52] <Fangs> these different theories have upsides and downsides, but the surprising thing is that for these three particular theories they always produce the same groups (for 'reasonably nice spaces')
[11:08:16] <Fangs> some theory might be easier to compute but a pain in the ass to prove anything with.. some theory is much easier to prove things but impossible to compute

[11:10:26] <Fangs> and the 'group' it produces are vector spaces (idk if you've seen them. think you might have)
[11:10:31] <zeroc00l0> So you prove that your space meets the requirements for one of the theories, then it gives you some homology group.

[11:11:33] <Fangs> zeroc00l0: you can do calculus with this 'de rham' theory, and vector spaces are comparatively much nicer than groups. for instance, the only thing you need to really care about a finite dimensional vector space is its dimension
[11:11:50] <Fangs> once you know its dimension you 'know' all you need to know about the space, essentially
[11:12:27] <Fangs> zeroc00l0: so this 'de rham' theory is an example of working "with real coefficient". in this case you are kinda forced to work with real coefficients

[11:14:59] <Fangs> more like.. here's an example of a differential form (on R^2) w = xy dy + x dx. to compute these groups you often have to take the (exterior) derivative of forms.. d(w) = y dx^dy + 0 dy^dx = y dx^dy
[11:15:20] <Fangs> im just taking partial derivatives and then adding a "dx" or a "dy" to the left of the other terms

[11:39:14] <greenbagels> but i was thinking more like
[11:39:37] <greenbagels> the CRT for integers mod n motivates a more general CRT for rings and stuff
[11:39:38] <Fangs> oh.. there;s also graphs and graph theory (from CS).. you can learn about planar graphs, that V - E + F = 2 theorem.. learn about some simplicial complex and learn about simplicial homology.. poincare duality might let you learn about cohomology too.. this is more in the direction topological graph theory
[11:39:54] <greenbagels> so maybe not number theory, but theres a clear algebraic link, i think

[11:55:34] <Franciman> greenbagels: for example field theory , field extensions and galois theory is very linked to the process of solving polynomial equations!
[11:55:42] <Franciman> it is very practical, imho
[11:55:52] <greenbagels> Franciman: right field theory is also enough of a fun puzzle in my mind that it feels motivated
[11:56:05] <greenbagels> but like module theory, i just get lost in it
[11:56:09] <Franciman> while groups well, they arise everywhere
[11:56:21] <Fangs> greenbagels: before I learnt about group theory I learnt about lattices (order theoretic sense) and graph theory.. so lattices helps with the isomorphism theorems.. helps with subgroup generated by.. and intersection of normal, etc.. in terms of 'geometric' intuition, I had been drawing cayley graphs instead of cayley tables
[11:56:27] <Franciman> modules are generalisations of vector fields at first, but also of other things
[11:56:31] <Franciman> they are helpful
[11:56:39] <Franciman> so maybe not directly linked to your direct experience
[11:56:45] <Fangs> I first learnt about group action as groups acting on graphs (after groups acting on sets)
[11:56:46] <Franciman> but they also rise in a lot of situations
[11:56:55] <Franciman> for example abelian groups are Z-modules
[11:57:11] <Fangs> greenbagels: so I just had a fucking field day with groups. it felt like everything I was learning was connected to the stuff I learnt previously
[11:57:27] <Fangs> calculus just felt.. unmotivatived with no 'real' application (that I care of)
[11:57:40] <greenbagels> yea yea the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups generalizes to the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a PID sure sure
[11:57:53] <greenbagels> Fangs: ah that is a very cool perspective
[11:58:23] <Franciman> Fangs: lol you're not interested in _any_ of the analysis applications?
[11:58:31] <Fangs> greenbagels: alg top was connected to group theory too.. do you know about fundemental groups and covering spaces?
[11:58:49] <greenbagels> yea we talked a little about basic alg top in my undergrad top class
[11:58:52] <Franciman> coverign spaces are also connected to galois theory :O
[11:58:53] <Fangs> Franciman: had a highschool teacher told me I shouldn't do physics (cause I was fucking up the 'math' side of things)
[11:58:59] <greenbagels> LOL
[11:59:02] <Fangs> I did do 2 semester of physics in my first year
[11:59:38] <Fangs> to spite her I decided to shy away from calculus and be a pure mathemtician instead
[11:59:45] <greenbagels> lol
[11:59:54] <Fangs> then oneday I'll comeback and tell her. "maybe you should consider just staying in physics"
[12:00:59] <Fangs> Franciman: cogalois theory.
[12:01:16] <greenbagels> i dont know how, but only now have i considered that mathematicians could be completely bored / uninterested in calculus
[12:01:19] <Fangs> Franciman: galois theory covering space theory. these are instances of a galois connection.. this again connects to lattices
[12:01:51] <Fangs> greenbagels: i've warmed up to calculus a bit. its interesting, but its *genuinely* a hard subject, compared toabstract algebra etc

[12:12:37] <Fangs> there's a surprising ammount of linear algebra you need to understand to 'get' multivariable calculus
[12:13:08] <greenbagels> but i dont know if you even have to develop a *full* theory of differential forms to tackle the first stuff, like the differentials dx and dy, integration, implicit differentiation
[12:14:01] <greenbagels> it does make me wonder why its taught using those tricks though; like for treating dy/dx as a fraction, to develop the idea of derivatives by stressing the idea of linear maps it doesn't take much work
[12:14:06] <Fangs> no no.. integration doesnt require differential forms.. you can talk about measures etc, but I just pretend its all riemman integrals. greenbagels its more that whole div curl grad nonsense

[12:20:23] <Fangs> this motivation for the derivative makes a lot more sense to me than the stuff they were telling me about
[12:21:01] <Fangs> epsilon delta is just the price you have to pay in order to be able to 'generalize' this to analytic functions. polynomials are easy
[12:21:34] <greenbagels> this is probably glossed over in calculus (not analysis) courses because once a function has continuous partials you can just pretend the jacobian is the whole picture

[23:07:38] <greenbagels> Z-module: they still teach those terms? huh
[23:09:46] *** Joins: geowiesnot (~user@5-51-190-244.abo.bbox.fr)
[23:09:52] <Metaleer> What terms specifically? 'Ossified'?
[23:10:33] <greenbagels> > addend, summand, minuend, subtrahend
[23:11:18] <Metaleer> I know of those terms because they're similar in the language I did my elementary education in, but I had no clue there existed English-language equivalent.
[23:11:21] <dalcde> summand is pretty commonly used
[23:12:12] <Metaleer> There's also dividend, divisor, quotient and remainder/residue.
[23:12:22] <Metaleer> For long division.
[23:13:16] <greenbagels> i remember learning those
[23:13:28] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109)
[23:13:34] <Metaleer> Interesting.
[23:14:11] <Metaleer> What about 'multiplicand' and 'multiplier'?
[23:14:38] <Metaleer> Most people don't use those -- since multiplication is typically commutative, people just say 'first factor' or whatever.
[23:15:06] <greenbagels> yeah i cant say i remember one way or another; the division terms are memorable to me for some reason
[23:16:12] *** Joins: jpn (~jpn@user/jpn)
[23:16:52] <Metaleer> Well, 'quotient' and 'remainder' are certainly common. More than likely because those terms keep showing up later when doing partial fraction decomposition of rational functions; they're used in math beyond the basic level, for things like integrals and Laplace transforms.
