[16:10:18] <Arya[m]1> hi
[16:10:33] <Arya[m]1> 8 hours for this year to end
[16:10:40] <gtlsgamr> what 8 only?
[16:10:54] <Arya[m]1> gtlsgamr: its 6 ryt
[16:11:07] <NeoVoid[m]> its just strings and integers xd
[16:11:11] <Arya[m]1> nvm 6 hrs
[16:11:29] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]: interesting perspective
[16:14:01] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: another perspective can be 
[16:14:01] <NeoVoid[m]> birthday of nobody we celebrate at every year like mad peoples. xd
[16:15:19] <gtlsgamr> that was okayishly interesting
[16:15:25] <gtlsgamr> not very interesting like the previous one
[16:15:35] <gtlsgamr> I don't blame you, sequels are usually disappointing.
[16:16:56] <NeoVoid[m]> may be instead we should consider celebrating our own birthdays like a new year. 
[16:16:57] <NeoVoid[m]> like decentralised new year.
[16:16:57] <NeoVoid[m]> every one has their unique new year starting from their birthday to next year birthdays.
[16:17:12] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: XD
[16:17:14] <gtlsgamr> Now that is an interesting Trilogy.
[16:17:27] <NeoVoid[m]> like a matrix lol
[16:17:28] <gtlsgamr> The third part is VERY interesting. Slightly better than the original;
[16:17:59] <Arya[m]1> maybe we can have a new years vc on gli mumble

[16:23:56] <NeoVoid[m]> I just watched thirteenth floor movie
[16:23:56] <NeoVoid[m]> which kinda matrixish
[16:23:56] <NeoVoid[m]> i think matrix 4th movie kinda forked from it. 
[16:23:56] <NeoVoid[m]> i mean simulation inside simulation might be they took from this movie
[16:24:46] <NeoVoid[m]> oops *spoilers* üòÇ
[16:26:52] <gtlsgamr> fuck you.
[16:32:25] <NeoVoid[m]> omg critics too soon. xD
[16:33:16] <NeoVoid[m]> I am gonna have bad tomato meter now
[16:33:57] <vipulogmx> And here I don't even know that a movie with that name Even existed
[16:34:48] <NeoVoid[m]> actually now that i am think about it simulation inside simulation is already presented in matrix one two and three movie. It just a different thing I failed to point at. xd
[16:35:47] <NeoVoid[m]> vipulogmx: if you were on telegram i would have shared it with you.
[16:36:13] <vipulogmx> Yes I'm in tg üôÇ

[16:36:41] <NeoVoid[m]> Its thirteenth floor 1999
[16:37:13] <gtlsgamr> Bro
[16:37:14] <NeoVoid[m]> vipulogmx: alright then pm me at @void00r
[16:37:17] <gtlsgamr> that looks like a porn movie
[16:37:23] <Arya[m]1> vipulogmx: samr
[16:37:26] <gtlsgamr> like a bad porn parody of the matrix
[16:37:35] <vipulogmx> Lmao
[16:37:53] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: nah i watched it 
[16:37:53] <NeoVoid[m]> its a pretty descent one
[16:38:48] <NeoVoid[m]> both are actually made in 1999

[16:44:33] <NeoVoid[m]> added curve a little
[17:07:05] <NeoVoid[m]> guyz after trying out zorin os. my monitor starts to act crazy.
[17:07:24] <NeoVoid[m]> all buttons of monitor seems like auto clicking them
[17:07:33] <NeoVoid[m]> all functions appears randomly.
[17:08:00] <NeoVoid[m]> and sometime monitor randomly turn on and off.
[17:08:44] <NeoVoid[m]> thats how mint destroyed my video IC in motherboard last time.
[17:09:09] <NeoVoid[m]> thats why i try to stay away from gnome and systemd.
[17:10:39] <Hello[m]> NeoVoid[m]: In my case in lite edition the panel was not responding don't know why hence I switched to other.
[17:14:18] <gtlsgamr> maybe instead of blaming those two, try to find out the cause. 
[17:14:58] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: idk how last time motherboard change krna pda.
[17:14:58] <NeoVoid[m]> i dont even do gaming
[17:15:15] <NeoVoid[m]> but watch movies mostly
[17:15:33] <NeoVoid[m]> may be thats why video ic burned out
[17:15:55] <gtlsgamr> That could have very easily been a hardware issue. Because since a long time people have been using those two
[17:16:05] <gtlsgamr> so an isolated case cannot be judge of softwaer
[17:17:29] <NeoVoid[m]> hmm may be
[17:17:48] <NeoVoid[m]> need to find job to buy new specs xd
[17:18:24] <Hello[m]> gtlsgamr: Yeh I tried intensive multitasking and used shortcutkeys so may be that's why.
