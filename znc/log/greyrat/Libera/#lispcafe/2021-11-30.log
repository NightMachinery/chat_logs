[00:13:47] <hayley> Good morning everyone!
[00:14:23] <hayley> White_Flame: Haven't heard that, but it helps half my family is Greek.
[00:19:05] <White_Flame> oh, the "omnicron" thing?  yeah, it's kinda funny
[00:19:30] <shka> pl: plutonium production is problem in itself
[00:19:40] <shka> White_Flame: as the angels have promised!
[00:20:31] <pl> shka: well, it means you need reprocessing, but nuclear loses most benefits without reprocessing 
[00:21:06] <shka> i mean: for the nuclear weapons proliferation
[00:21:10] <pl> BTW, Poland used to be exporter of Pu239 aut weaponised concentration 
[00:21:53] <pl> shka: I think it's time to start applying NPT instead if American imperialism greenwashed 
[00:22:33] <shka> well, yes
[00:23:05] <shka> but proliferation should not be the problem for countries already armed with nuclear weapons 
[00:23:35] <pl> It's only a problem for them, to be quite honest 
[00:23:52] <pl> Snap controls etc can work 
[00:24:10] <pl> Meanwhile nuclear giants policies is *why* N. Korea went nuclear 
[00:24:41] <shka> well, nuclear weapons is a different topic
[00:25:11] <pl> Anyway, NPT with the extension protocols gives tools to handle it sensibly 
[00:25:13] <shka> but there is no reason for anybody would have concern about France having running plutonium production
[00:25:26] <pl> Not American style "we want off switch for your grid" 
[00:25:30] <shka> because, well, they are already armed
[00:26:14] <shka> and same goes for other countries already having operational warheads
[00:26:35] <shka> and Japan
[00:26:48] <shka> because there is no way in hell japan would pursue nuclear weapons 
[00:27:43] <pl> Japan is treated by USA as atomic armed 
[00:28:01] <pl> Also, Poland quite recently had something like 1500kg of Pu239 
[00:28:22] <shka> lol
[00:28:59] <shka> how do you get over 1 tonne of plutonium?
[00:29:15] <pjb> Processing 100 tonnes of penchbend?
[00:29:23] <pl> By breeding it from U235 
[00:29:26] <pjb> Oh, Pu.
[00:30:01] <shka> what for?
[00:30:37] <pl> It was part of our nuclear waste 
[00:30:45] <shka> eh, fair enough 
[00:30:55] <shka> still funny 
[00:31:23] <shka> USA: "Fundamentalist countries pursue the nuclear weapons!"
[00:31:28] <pl> Remember that we only got rid of tactical nuclear bombers in 1990 or so 
[00:31:32] <shka> Poland: "Nervous sweeting."
[00:33:06] <pl> Up to at least 1989 we had front line tactical nuclear strike squadron using free fall bombs 
[00:33:12] <pl> On supersonic bombers 
[00:34:01] <shka> because standoff weapons are for cowards
[00:34:28] <pl> They were designed to make breaches in NATO lines 
[00:36:06] <pl> BTW, when it comes to weird trivia about countries... 
[00:36:27] <pl> shka: where do you think most western and most Eastern EU borders are? 
[00:36:56] <shka> blow my mind
[00:37:12] <pl> EU has a land border with Brazil 
[00:37:25] <pl> And somewhere in Oceania 
[00:38:01] <shka> French Guiana and the likes?
[00:38:11] <pl> In fact, pretty sure Sun does not set over EU 
[00:38:17] <pl> shka: yeah 
[00:38:22] <pl> It's integral part of France 
[00:38:28] <shka> oh, but it sets over the Britain 
[00:38:37] <pl> Unlike British overseas territories which got separated from UK 
[00:38:43] <shka> selwyn: suck it 
[00:40:18] <pl> Funnily enough, this is by choice for bits 
[00:40:21] <pl> *brits 
[00:40:43] <pl> I mean, it's Westminster's choice to not incorporate OTs 
[00:41:13] <pl> They had weird status which made it easy to trade and so with EU
[00:41:16] <shka> well, i am going to sleep now
[00:41:32] <pl> But I think Falklanders couldn't just hop on a plane to Europe and so on 
[00:41:33] <shka> see you tomorrow!
[00:42:00] <pl> Cya 
[00:47:43] <selwyn> last i heard the overseas territories were pissed off
[00:49:22] <selwyn> i think that the channel islands and isle of man, which have been seperate forever, set a precedent with dealing with the overseas territories
[00:49:29] <selwyn> whereas the french republic doesn't really have that
[00:50:35] <selwyn> and the french brazil border is in fact france's longest border
[00:57:25] <pl> selwyn: well, there's also the difference of British Empire being legal Ball of mud, whereas French declared in constitution that the republic is indivisible 
[00:57:45] <selwyn> certainly makes things easier
[00:58:03] <pl> The dates when Canada and Australia became de jure, not just de facto, independent exemplifies this for me 
[00:58:25] <pl> That's, iirc, 1980 and 1983 
[00:59:01] <pl> And you still have 3 different types of citizenship on the books 
[00:59:46] <selwyn> the queen dimissed the australian prime minister in 1975

[01:56:14] <hayley> gilberth: I'm thinking about the Hyperscan-ish idea of decomposing regular expressions into more machines. We could still win even with grep[] DFA, non-grep[] DFA, and isum searchers. If we have [0-9]+x[0-9]+, then a good move would be to search for [0-9]x (or x[0-9]), as that bigram should be uncommon, and then consume more digits on either side.

[02:28:46] <dra> Hi hayley! What are you working on?
[02:29:53] <hayley> Currently nothing, just considering writing an explanatory article on the one-more-re-nightmare compiler, and also how to win on harder regular expressions.
[02:30:23] <hayley> In the case of [0-9]+x[0-9]+ we would have the trigram [0-9]x[0-9] actually. Just pick that to scan for.
[02:30:32] <hayley> ...then work backwards and forwards to consume other characters?
[02:33:30] <selwyn> struggled and failed to deal with regex in nginx conf files today
[02:35:09] <dra> I have avoided RE as much as possible.
[02:35:14] <dra> But that paper sure looks interesting.
[02:36:03] <hayley> Don't worry, I still don't know how to write regular expressions.
[02:39:20] <dra> I did like the Lol section on RE but that was more about the reader macro than about the actual expressions.
[02:41:38] <selwyn> > Package ASDF does not exist.
[02:41:41] <selwyn> this isn't good
[02:43:00] <hayley> Let Over Lambda incorrectly states that CL-PPCRE produces optimised code for regular expressions, when it just produces a chain of closures. Very big deal, when CL-PPCRE isn't actually faster than PCRE2 without JIT these days.
[02:44:36] * hayley contemplates also mentioning what a fourth RE nightmare should do (as the new submatching compiler is the third, technically).
[02:45:34] <selwyn> my reading of let over lambda is that the claim is that the chain of closures *is* the optimised code
[02:46:18] <hayley> Well, bullshit, given that we get 40x better with a DFA without SIMD, and 414x better with SIMD.
[02:46:27] <dra> Holy shit.
[02:48:39] * hayley uploaded an image: (34KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/iDKCAczBJtKpmdsvwjCDmPfJ/resolution.png >
[02:49:28] <hayley> Here's the DFA for a resolution recogniser, and the trigraph [0-9]x[0-9] should be pretty clear.
[02:59:37] <dra> Hmm. If only I knew how to check if my SBCL it built with AVX2.
[03:00:55] <hayley> I found it'll only work on SBCL 2.1.10, because I use funny instructions that most people don't use, so no one found bugs in the assembler. More important, perhaps is that your CPU supports AVX2.
[03:01:45] <hayley> *no one found bugs in the assembler prior, until I gave heisig a list of instructions for SB-SIMD and so they got tested.

[03:03:32] <dra> Yes, my CPU has AVX2.
[03:04:32] <dra> hayley: _At least_ 2.1.10 or _exactly_ 2.1.10?
[03:04:52] <hayley> At least, though I don't think there has been a new release yet.
[03:06:12] * dra confused SBCL and SLIME versions.
[03:06:17] <dra> Gotcha.
[03:09:03] <hayley> If I really want to decompose DFAs though, I'd need to start running regular expressions backwards, which gets hairy when we have "longest match first" semantics. But IIRC it is not hard to fix that.
[03:09:41] <hayley> Yeah, it's just the derivative of concatenation according to gilberth.

[03:21:27] <hayley> But does that still work with tags and Kleene closures too? Can I reverse (a|aa)*?
[03:22:04] <hayley> We could always just run forwards again, just for tags, if it's too much of a hassle, I guess.
[03:24:36] <hayley> https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi19-wang-xiang.pdf "In practise, we find that 87% to 94% of the regex rules in IDSes have at least one extractable string"
[03:27:08] <hayley> I went to look up some RE which causes O(2^n) states for a DFA. The first result was http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/3261/sp17/expdfa.pdf and it appears wrong.
[03:27:39] <hayley> ...I think? /me rereads
[03:30:10] <hayley> No, that is O(2^n), and I misread. Next question, are there any actually useful regular expressions that exhibit O(2^n)?

[04:58:58] <White_Flame> are they all persistent maps though?
[04:59:10] <hayley> Yes.
[05:00:09] <White_Flame> yeah those need a bunch of variations to try to rein in size/speed
[05:00:27] <White_Flame> if you're not pure functional, no reason to be burdened by all their map architecture
[05:15:47] <semz> Apparently, Unicode's high surrogates are the surrogates with the lower magnitude code points. Who decided that one?
[05:16:51] <White_Flame> heh
[05:17:15] <White_Flame> having a gander at it, since the high ones come first in the stream followed by the low ones, I guess they ordered them like that?

[05:31:22] <semz> But if the high surrogates had the higher codepoints, you wouldn't have to set the high bit when stitching surrogate pairs together. See, clearly this is a grave deficiency.

[05:32:44] <semz> Well, you'd save one addition.

[07:39:43] <gilberth> dave0: That is well above my cousin's cooking skills which would be "put in in the fryer or pan".

[07:42:34] <hayley> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine doesn't mention accepting states, whereas https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton does.

[09:23:01] <hayley> This is why I want a probability model, and ideally not one so Anglocentric (as IIRC the dataset ripgrep uses is rustc source code and some English books). Or maybe I just want a way for the user to provide a model.
[09:23:19] * hayley still half-competent Greek speaker, complains
[09:23:57] <gilberth> Problems mere greppers have. I could profile, if I wish.
[09:24:58] <hayley> The Hyperscan paper also mentions "linear regex", so I guess "linear tagged regex" is confusing. "Affine tagged regex" it is!
[09:25:28] <hayley> gilberth: A model is a summary of a profile of similar data. Your lexing high horse isn't that high.
[09:26:39] <gilberth> Well, a scanner is written to scan a specific languages, so I could have specific profiles on real inputs.
[09:27:13] <gilberth> However, given those bets, shouldn't all benchmarks been taken with a grain of salt?
[09:27:38] <hayley> Why even given those bets? "Put micro-trust in a micro-benchmark" as Cliff Click says.
[09:30:35] <gilberth> For me to support four rotation counts could be relatively cheap with only eight additional chips^WICs. I wonder what the rotation count should be? 1 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit, and 24 bit, or rather 1 bit, 4 bit, and 8 bit? Or something else. I rotate right only.
[09:31:31] <hayley> 1, 2, 4, 8? Then you would have O(log n) shifts up to 15 bits, and repeating 8 to shift more is fine.
[09:32:59] <gilberth> I contemplate that extracting octets should be cheap. This should be more common than say a 2 bit shift. Probabilities again!
[09:35:03] <gilberth> Being originally word oriented with only a load word, but no load byte instruction, some ARM processors, take the low two bits of an address as an 8n rotation count. That way loading an octet from a octet address is just one additional AND.
[09:35:39] <gilberth> But wait! I would need a right shift by two, too! Dammit.
[09:36:26] <gilberth> I just can't afford a full barrel shifter.

[11:39:58] <moon-child> typo
[11:40:14] <ck_> sorry, didn't see the correction
[11:40:21] <moon-child> gilberth: exactly.  It is superoptimization in the general case
[11:42:04] <ck_> does llvm have a stage that does this? They have pages and pages of these things if I remember correctly
[11:42:19] <moon-child> no
[11:42:37] <moon-child> that's what they were complaining about
[11:42:49] <hayley> There is a pass to convert a loop to POPCNT.
[11:43:18] <gilberth> What about (ecase i (0 1) (1 2) (2 4) (3 8) (4 16))?
[11:43:38] <hayley> I don't see why not.
[11:43:42] <moon-child> hayley: yeah.  That's actually kinda sensible tho since there's no popcnt in c, so you can write the portable code and the peephole gets it
[11:43:53] <hayley> Well, loading from such a tiny array might be faster than branching.
[11:43:55] <moon-child> cooler tho is they can turn recursive functions into loops
[11:43:59] <moon-child> (non tail-recursive)
[11:44:15] <gilberth> Well, a C compiler must recognize POPCNT because there is no such C operator. Likewise for bit rotation. They special cased on the latter for ages.
[11:44:19] <hayley> Does it just wiggle around to produce a tail recursive loop?
[11:44:45] <moon-child> I don't think so
[11:45:01] <moon-child> I think the example I saw was for factorial or something like that
[11:45:36] <gilberth> Yes, C compiler can do that. They notice what the accumulator is.
[11:46:13] <gilberth> However, I really wonder how useful that is.
[11:47:18] <moon-child> obviously if some loop is slow it can be rewritten to be faster, but it is nice if the compiler can do the work for you can write clearer code.  That's what optimizing compilers are for in general, no?

[11:52:00] <moon-child> at the bottom, they have the exact same loop as gcc

[11:52:32] <hayley> So what is the other code for?
[11:52:53] <moon-child> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:53:57] <moon-child> hmm.  I guess maybe it is unrolled?  If I say -fno-tree-vectorize, I get what looks like an ordinary unrolled loop

[11:58:08] <moon-child> 'the language you would get by removing a character off the end of the language'  shouldn't that be 'off the front'?  (I guess could 'front end', but)

[12:08:19] <hayley> Hm, no, a register machine does arbitrary crap on registers, whereas we only dispatch on the input sequence.
[12:08:26] * hayley just writes Mealy machines.
[12:08:56] <gilberth> Yep, if you see the assignments to be done as the output. This is how I see that.
[12:09:20] <hayley> That is what I write later.

[23:11:44] <pjb> Note that SpaceX makes its first stage return by slowing down to 0, and some more to go back near the take off position.  Ie. they don't have orbital speed.
[23:12:07] <pjb> The tiles on the SpaceShip are precisely because it comes with orbital speed.
[23:12:36] <pjb> But I guess once they'll have lost a few hundred people for defective tiles, they'll just slow down on orbit, and fall calmly down.
