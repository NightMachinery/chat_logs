[00:09:48] <randall> yay \o/
[00:10:15] <PerfDave> Valheim must be using some API or something that OpenArena doesn't.
[00:10:49] <randall> Yeah, but the steam CLI is painful to use. There's no way to properly script the thing, you need to pass your login credentials via parameters (every time), etc.
[00:11:51] <PerfDave> Yeah, I was looking at building some Steam containers to make it easier to deploy servers.
[00:13:24] <randall> Installing Ark and 4 mods was such a PITA, as steam did install the mods into the wrong dir. So I had to script tons of things around it to copy data over, and since you can't find out the mod was updated or not, I had to do it every time.

[00:23:45] <anon16_> Hello, I just came across this page (https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/status/release/stable) and it seems like many security issues in packages are not patched (some of these are relatively old). Is this normal? Should I be concerned?
[00:25:32] <sney> this is normal, and you should only be concerned if there are issues there that affect you directly
[00:25:51] <sney> lots of stuff gets assigned CVEs even if it's a very narrow threat
[00:26:43] <Khepra> that said, some packages are actually vulnerable. if security is concern, you should employ mitigations that assume vulnerability
[00:27:47] <anon16_> So why does this happen? Is Debian running low on maintainers?
[00:28:43] <somiaj> more an more software upstream fixes are a new upstream release which is against debian stable policy
[00:29:08] <anon16_> ah
[00:29:29] <somiaj> so it is just getting harder and harder to backport security fixes since upstream may not help and their CVEs may not always point at the exact commit that fixed it
[00:30:32] *** Quits: interdome (~znc@interdo.me) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:34:32] <sney> plus, while it's good to take note of possible security issues, a lot of them are truly minor and will not affect the vast majority of systems. so a fix is not a priority at all, and may stay "vulnerable" for the lifespan of the release, or eventually rolled up along with other patches if there are any
[00:35:35] <somiaj> also some do not affect debian's default options and only features a user would have to manually enable. Debian sometimes considers those low risk and focuses its time elsewhere.
[00:35:53] *** Joins: guiverc (~guiverc@ubuntu/member/guiverc)
[00:36:11] <somiaj> in general it is a very complex thing to navigate, just lots of CVE vunlabilities due to the version in debian that haven't been patched doesn't mean much without digging into the weeds

[00:43:53] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[00:43:58] <tjcarter> But weechat has no libs, nothing anything depends on except for itself
[00:44:14] <somiaj> anon16_: Using repositories that aren't not designed to be compadable with the release of debian you have is bad practice
[00:44:19] <sney> yeah, typically, a 3rd party repo that's just for 1 package that doesn't have a lot of dependencies will be harmless, same for using the signal-desktop repo or whatver
[00:44:37] <tjcarter> The way I've started explaining it is ‚Ä¶ think of Debian's package system like a tree.
[00:44:42] <somiaj> there are plenty of thrid party repos that do take the time to ensure things are compiled against debian libs and don't provide alternatives to debian's libs
[00:44:47] <tjcarter> It's okay to install some outside leaves
[00:45:02] <tjcarter> if you start replacing branches though, you're gonna have problems.

[00:45:42] <anon16_> That's a good way to think about it, thanks
[00:46:19] <tjcarter> Ubuntu and friends mess with the trunk. It works because they support it all. deb-multimedia replaces branches ‚Ä¶ and there's no way to support that because it's one guy mixing things in a bad way
[00:47:19] <tjcarter> WeeChat is a leaf though ‚Ä¶ if you replace that, the rest of Debian will chug along just fine. And if you're using those packages and need help with 'em, we're probably going to point you down the hall to #weechat because they're not our packages.

[03:49:24] <somiaj> that is if you want to dive deeper into what upgraded and why it broke your nvidia drivers. But I see no recent upgrade in buster that could have broken the nvidia drivers like that
[03:50:36] <somiaj> though maybe if you haven't updated buster for a few point releases, it could want to upgrade far more

[04:10:32] <themill> 2026 looks like it's 5 years away to me
[04:11:15] <sney> 5 years refers to the total support time from the release. you get ~2 years as stable, ~2 years as oldstable, and then at least 1 more year as LTS (but in practice it's longer)
[04:13:43] *** Quits: luke-jr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[04:14:35] <somiaj> dman777: 2 years stable + 1 year old stable + 2 years lts = 5 years
[04:15:01] <somiaj> sney: I think your old stable is off, I thought it was about 1 year of support after the release
[04:15:12] <sney> yeah, that sounds more accurate
[04:15:14] <somiaj> hence why you see lts end about every 2 years
[04:15:22] <sney> and then there's ELTS after that
[04:16:18] <somiaj> though that is more limited and one should really consider dontanting to the third party if using it

[06:02:34] <holycow> i need to change mine
[06:09:35] <somiaj> holycow: it depends, /etc/skel is just what gets used at the creation of an account, once an account is created it is up to the user to modify things

[06:11:04] <somiaj> yea, desktop apps suck and I hate this too, but I don't think there is much you can do, as these are predefied
[06:11:41] <somiaj> maybe if you look into freedestkop.org you can find a way to redfine the default location of the Downloads/Desktop/etc folders, though all apps may not honor that
[06:11:56] <holycow> i changed this once like 10 years ago and all new users had lower case folders.  this is my first fresh install since then, so much has changed.
[06:12:27] <somiaj> ,i xdg-user-dirs

[06:12:31] <holycow> aha, let's see, great idea. i was checkign out /etc/xdg
[06:12:35] <somiaj> there is also xdg-user-dirs-gtk that might work
[06:12:54] <holycow> oh! had no idea that existed.  huh, appreciate it.
[06:13:06] <somiaj> ahh there is /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults
[06:13:16] <somiaj> that would be useful for system vs just a single user
[06:13:38] <somiaj> though might have to decide if you want this to be systemwide or not. I usually suggest doing things as a user, and let your users decide what they like the best
[06:13:47] <somiaj> changing common defaults for other users may not go over well

[11:37:40] <Maxdamantus> I've often found it very convenient being able to use my previous phone (N900) as a regular unrestricted Linux system occasionally. eg, if I need to create some weird temporary network setup (does Android support GPRS via DUN over Bluetooth? dunno) or using `g_file_storage` to expose some installation disk file over USB, or even just programming without having to deal with the limited set of packages
[11:37:46] <Maxdamantus> in termux that are built to work around selinux/seccomp restrictions.
[11:38:03] <jelly> almost all Debian userspace uses glibc and glibc ld.so
[11:38:29] <Maxdamantus> and not really a fan of the security model that seems to be supported by existing rooting mechanism (basically Magisk), so seems preferable to just set something up myself.
[11:39:29] <Maxdamantus> Yeah, I'm not running Debian in the same root as Android. It's in a separate mount namespace with a separate root.
[11:41:30] <Maxdamantus> and practically any interaction between the two will have to be over ssh.

[11:50:51] <Maxdamantus> Oh, nvm, realised you were referring to the proot thing when you mentioned glibc.
[11:51:59] <jelly> I mean you can use something like proot to remap uid/gid if needed
[11:52:00] <Maxdamantus> and actually, looks like it uses ptrace rather than dynamic linking.

[20:48:42] <plantroon> I actually have an older kernel running right now for testing, but it's all the same on bullseye kernel
[20:49:44] <jelly> obvious question: why are you using bonding with a single member?
[20:50:15] <plantroon> it was done that way for convenience to have the same IF names on physical and virtual systems

[20:51:00] <plantroon> not using bond on a single interface is also a solution, I tried and it works that way, but I still think it's buggy behavior since this same setup worked on Buster and actually still works on Bullseye on some other servers we have

[20:54:57] <jelly> there was a race with bonding on bare metal systems where the workaround was to manually bring link up with eg. auto eth0; iface inet eth0 manual;   up ip link set dev eth0 up; sleep 6
[20:57:25] <jelly> plantroon, perhaps you can add something like that to /e/n/interfaces, or a pre-up line to bond0 doing similar link-up and a bit of sleep
[20:58:07] <plantroon> I'll try adding delays, but I feel like this is a very pesky bug that it won't help xD
[20:58:28] <jelly> there's just 0.01s between bringing up eth0 and link being up, sleep 1 ought to be enough
[20:58:50] <plantroon> I'll add 10, no hurry
[20:59:27] <jelly> as minimum change, add just a pre-up for bond0, eg.   pre-up ip l set dev eth0 up; sleep 1

[22:18:15] <sney> !they don't know
[22:18:16] <dpkg> We're sorry your distro's channel isn't being helpful, but that doesn't make it appropriate to use #debian for non-Debian questions.  Please go back to your channel and wait patiently for better help, or install Debian and party with us.

[22:45:07] <Mmike> I guess I'll create a local apt.conf.sample file, explaining what needs to be in to enable Acquire::Proxy. Then Dockerfile will check if apt.conf exists locally, if so, copy it to a proper place inside the container.

[23:30:14] <Animortis> Hey, does Debian need encryption hooks for the kernel to run luks?
[23:31:27] <randall> Animortis: It supports it out of the box, if that's your question.
[23:31:37] <Animortis> I've managed to get a VM past grub, but it won't open the mapper partition. Thinking it has to do with that.
[23:31:40] <Animortis> Ah nuts

[23:35:43] <Animortis> Yeah it yells the UUID for the /mapper partition doesn't exist, although that's defined only in the fstab
[23:36:57] <Animortis> crypttab points to its name and /dev/sda partition.
[23:37:44] <Animortis> As does /etc/default/grub
[23:38:12] *** Quits: sharkee (~sharkee@185.93.2.206) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[23:38:34] <Animortis> But if I don't need to load any hooks, then there's something else I'm missing other than those three.

[23:48:46] <randall> initramfs-tools even.
[23:49:04] <Animortis> That was helpful
[23:50:04] <jelly> Animortis, what does your /etc/crypttab look like?  It found it more reliable to use /dev/disk/by-id/* names instead of /dev/sdwhatever there
[23:50:27] <Animortis> jelly: I use the UUID typically for safety
[23:50:40] <Animortis> I think initramfs might have trouble with key files... That may be the issue
[23:51:00] <jelly> I don't think partitions have uuids; filesystems do
[23:51:04] <Animortis> tbh I'm not sure what a key file is for vs just having encryption. Maybe I can drop that.
