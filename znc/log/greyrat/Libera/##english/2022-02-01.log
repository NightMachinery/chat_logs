[04:59:13] <Jong> Would you call how small of changes in distance gps can detect its precision, accuracy, level of detail, finess, sensitivity, or something else?
[04:59:25] *** Joins: Nact (~l@host-149-154-250-116.dynamic.voo.be)
[05:01:10] <OMGOMG> sensitivity is good
[05:02:20] <Jong> I'm also now wondering how better I could have stated my question. "how small of changes in distance" sounds like someone struggling to say something they can't figure out how to say
[05:05:51] <OMGOMG> it's fine
[05:05:52] <Jong> What would you call how precisely GPS can track an object? 
[05:07:47] <OMGOMG> not sure what you mean by that
[05:11:46] <LjL> Jong, the GPSTest app calls the "confidence interval", to borrow a term from uh, mostly COVID papers as far as my knowledge of it goes, "accuracy". that's not about how small the changes it can detect are, it's just about whether when it says you're at X,Y it could easily be something like X+1,X-1 because it's within the accuracy radius, or tolerance i guess is another term that may or may not apply in some cases. BUT the position *changes* it can detect are also 
[05:11:47] <LjL> quite tied to the accuracy, because if you know there's likely to be a ±1m error for instance, then you can't distinguish a 1m "actual motion" from a 1m jiggering of the signal
[05:12:32] <LjL> one way to practically improve the accuracy of measurement of a specific point using GPS, by the way, can be to just leave the receiver there for a longer period of time, and average the position it determines
[05:12:46] <LjL> that of course only works if you're trying to determine the position of a *static* point
[05:12:56] <TimMc> Jong: "Maximum precision" might be appropriate.
[05:12:59] <LjL> so there are some tradeoff between the ability to detect movement and the precision of static measurements
[05:13:36] <Jong> Thanks LjL for the info. Very informative
[05:13:42] <LjL> i'm kind of talking about GPS itself as well as or even more than English here i guess, but i think they're a bit intertwined
[05:14:09] <TimMc> In general, this is the relationship between accuracy and precision: http://cdn.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/precision_accuracy.png

[05:22:14] <twb> LjL: maybe I misread you
[05:22:29] <LjL> TimMc, looks like the "low accuracy, high precision" would be the scenario where you're able to track an object's movement finely, whereas you couldn't when you have "high accuracy, low precision" (apart of course from the trivial "high accuracy, high precision" where you clearly can)
[05:23:33] <LjL> twb, i specifically added "as far as my knowledge of it goes" to indicate that it's just where *i* am used to using it, and it shouldn't be taken as an indication of provenance of the term in general, but... okay, at least now it's clearer

[11:10:41] <thomas25> receiving end*
[11:12:17] <twb> Speaking as an Australian, I think sarcasm is fundamentally inferior to satire.
[11:14:14] <twb> Such as in The Frogs when someone goes "oh, this is armor?  I thought it was toilet shells"
[11:15:48] <twb> I guess the key difference is that in sarcasm, tone makes it absolutely clear that you are adopting a false position

[11:16:04] <twb> Whereas with satire, the position itself being inherently absurd or stupid is what makes it clear
[11:17:52] <bullgard4> What science branch is "target detection"? See https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:2382:ed-1:v1:en : "… template > Note 1 to entry: Templates are used in character recognition, target detection, speech recognition, etc."
[11:18:52] <twb> bullgard4: as in like "which one of those buildings is the school" ?

[11:20:00] <bullgard4> s/foe/for/

[18:25:14] <CuriosTiger> I learned another one yesterday. "article" is from Greek arthros -- link -- which is also the root that gave us arthritis.
[18:26:30] <CuriosTiger> and in the case of "article", it appears it got borrowed into Latin to describe body part ("articus"), then turned into a diminutive ("articulus") to describe grammatical articles in Greek at a time when the Romance languages did not have them.

[18:31:39] <CuriosTiger> "this is actually the dumbest..." is probably what's intended.
[18:32:05] <CuriosTiger> you cannot put an adverb between the article and the noun.
[18:32:44] <Urawa> i really have no idea about that

[18:33:31] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@user/great-taste/x-5798414)
[18:33:42] <CuriosTiger> In your example, "actually" has to come before "the".
[18:34:13] <Urawa> but if i wanna say the joke is actually dumb?
[18:34:35] <Urawa> oh whatever this is confusing
[18:35:47] <CuriosTiger> You are saying that.
[18:35:54] <CuriosTiger> "actually" modifies "the joke".
[18:36:07] <CuriosTiger> or here, "the dumbest joke".
