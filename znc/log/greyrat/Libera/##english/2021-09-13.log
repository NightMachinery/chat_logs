[12:01:59] <vaio> hello. I've some issue with some usage of the word "before", like (i know it's a weird example): to kneel before someone

[12:02:36] <vaio> my brain understands it as "kneel before someone else does it"
[12:02:48] <vaio> but it seems the meaning is just "kneel in front of someone"
[12:03:00] <vaio> so ... it's a bit weird.  Or am I misunderstanding something ?
[12:03:01] <furrykef> Correct, "before" means "in front of" in this context
[12:03:48] <vaio> furrykef: does "before" also have other meanings ?
[12:03:55] <furrykef> Not that I can think of
[12:03:58] <vaio> and how do you do to get it right ?
[12:04:17] <vaio> how would you say "kneel faster than someone else", then, using the word "before"
[12:04:22] <vaio> :s
[12:04:31] <furrykef> "kneel before he does", perhaps
[12:04:31] <vaio> (sorry, not trying to troll, just to understand)

[12:05:12] <furrykef> This usage of "before" is fairly rare and only appears in a few contexts, though, such as kneeling
[12:05:37] <furrykef> "Stand" is another verb you might see it with
[12:05:57] <vaio> oh, ok. might be related to the posture then

[14:03:38] <masber> ok, so in which context could I use the expression "to throw the ball"?
[14:03:46] <blkshp> Baseball.
[14:03:58] <blkshp> I don't know it as an idiomatic expression.
[14:04:13] <masber> or maybe it is "passing the ball on to you"?
[14:04:41] <blkshp> You can throw a curve ball, you can drop the ball, you can pass the buck
[14:04:53] <blkshp> Maybe this is an American saying I'm unaware of.

[20:19:09] <blkshp> It's one of those wierd ones.
[20:20:16] <LuisP14> wired?
[20:20:20] <LuisP14> :
[20:20:23] <LuisP14> :>
[20:20:36] <blkshp> weird*
[20:20:38] <blkshp> :P
[20:21:24] <LuisP14> but still, weird? :3
[20:21:51] <blkshp> Definitely.
[20:22:35] * LuisP14 awaits explication
[20:22:43] <blkshp> I don't know what you're asking. 
[20:23:15] <blkshp> the fact that it is uncountable yet plural, I cannot explain because I'm not that clever.
[20:24:31] <LuisP14> you had said it's one of the weird ones, wondering what 'it' was, lol
[20:24:52] <blkshp> "paint"

[20:55:45] <kurahaupo> Nouns that are normally uncountable can be used countably when they refer to categories, or to implicit units. The common examples are "the menu has 2 meats, 4 pastas, and 3 fruits" (categories eg "kinds of"), and "please ask the bar-keeper for 3 beers and 2 waters" (implicit units denominated in "glasses of").
[20:58:40] <kurahaupo> "Acrylic and oil paints" are two (or more) kinds of paints, as are "acrylics, and oil paints", so I don't think the distinction suggested is valid
[20:59:08] <kurahaupo> Unless you mean acrylics as the substrate rather than the paint type
[21:00:02] <kurahaupo> Using oil paint on an acrylic surface would be rather strange

[22:17:21] <huf> I hope the bayonet was *on* the machete
[22:17:30] <huf> because that sounds very american
[22:18:08] <darsie> A machete is like a sword or big knife.
