[03:01:28] <Panther> I think I have it figured out... I am not going to hold back any of the strike force to deal with the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps, the main attack will be to destroy those Russian units already in place. The 5th Guards will arrive over a time frame, so I will use the whole regiment of remaining unmechanized panzer grenadiers, plus 2 more battalions from the other regiment, and hmm.. looks like 
[03:01:28] <Panther> nothing else. Those 5 battalions of panzergrenadiers, plus the support troops from the 2nd Regiment will have to hold off one of the most powerful units in the whole Soviet Army long enough for the attack to destroy the remnants of the 29th and 18th Tank Corps.

[18:56:54] <macrobat> classical tunes are named liek opus 321 in Eb minor 3rd movement allegro
[18:57:25] <macrobat> that one even has lyrics
[18:57:30] <louipc> wow maybe they improved it
[18:59:34] <macrobat> you know something of the style the tune is in, so you can have a time frame for it, then you go through composers active around that time?
[19:01:20] <louipc> Gerula: its like taking a passage out of a book.
