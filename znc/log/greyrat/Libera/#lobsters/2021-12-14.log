[08:17:21] <pe> Such as Apple's talks on HEIF.

[08:20:49] <pe> By the way, if you see someone argue against HEIC, tell them they're full of shit.
[08:21:18] <pe> At least in comparison to JPEG.
[08:21:59] <pe> JPEG 2000 is a weird animal.
[08:23:22] <pe> HEIC even has an advantage over JPEG XL.

[20:36:58] <varjag> and java was all hotness around turn of the century
[20:37:08] <zbrown[m]> It takes armies of engineers to build JVM/CLR/GolangVM/v8/etc.
[20:38:32] <technomancy> zbrown[m]: overall agree with this but "it takes a lot of people" isn't the strongest argument
[20:38:38] <technomancy> log4j took a lot of work too

[20:38:59] <constxd> what is GolangVM
[20:39:21] <pe> A bunch of letters.
[20:40:05] <pe> Go has a VM as much as C does.

[20:43:14] <zbrown[m]> technomancy: my point re a lot of people is that there is substantial engineering g effort that goes into building VM’s. Similar in lift to designing processors. Turns out there’s a lot to get right

[20:43:48] <varjag> driving unicycle on a highway is also difficult
[20:44:33] <varjag> but if you invest billions into it, it'll probably can hold its own in the traffic
[20:44:51] <pe> Electric unicycles can be alright.
[20:45:09] <pe> I mean, the top end ones can probably reach the low end speed limit.

[20:46:13] <pe> Not that I'd like to drive an EUC at 80 kmph.
[20:46:59] <zbrown[m]> varjag: yes yes, we can all make reductionist arguments
[20:47:02] <iDrougge> And when there's an accident, the electric unicycle community will tell you "It's a unicycle, what did you expect?"
[20:47:28] <iDrougge> "It was made in ten days, of course it's not perfect."
[20:47:32] <varjag> after applets failed by early 00s, there was no compelling technical argument for jvm anymore
[20:47:42] <varjag> applets, look em up
[20:47:55] <varjag> but the inertia of prior investment was enormous
[20:48:29] <pe> Reminder that SIM cards contain Java.
[20:48:34] <iDrougge> varjag: I think Android wanted to hedge their bets on CPU architectures when they decided to use Java on the slowest and most memory starved architectures.
[20:48:34] <companion_cube> what are you even talking about
[20:48:46] <companion_cube> what were people going to use? C++?
[20:49:03] <companion_cube> it's not like popular GC'd languages were legion
[20:49:06] <varjag> companion_cube: java could just compile to native code
[20:49:13] <varjag> there is zero need for jvm
[20:49:19] <companion_cube> you still need a GC
[20:49:23] <varjag> and?
[20:49:32] <companion_cube> and I guess people liked dynamic class load and whatnot
[20:49:35] <companion_cube> and GCs are fucking hard? :D
[20:49:53] <varjag> gc and vm are entirely orhtogonal issues
[20:50:01] <iDrougge> Can't you do dynamic class load without a VM?
[20:50:10] <varjag> yes
[20:50:10] <companion_cube> maybe with a .so, I suppose
[20:50:13] <pe> I'm certain that GC is hard on Java.
[20:50:19] <pe> Because it keeps running out of memory.
[20:50:38] <companion_cube> honestly I don't know why java isn't compiled, but people do love their .jar
[20:51:34] <companion_cube> blabla bytecode compatibility blabla proprietary libraries
[20:52:06] <pe> Write once, OOM anywhere.
[20:52:30] <pe> What was that quote...
[20:52:47] <iDrougge> Smalltalk was the next big thing before the industry settled on Java.
[20:53:05] <pe> Write once, run away!
[20:53:39] <varjag> java was still a net improvement imo… lots of incompetent c++ code was floating around in mid-90s
