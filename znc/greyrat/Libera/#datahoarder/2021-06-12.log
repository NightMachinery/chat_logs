[21:29:47] <Myself> IMHO, Chia is a losing game right now unless you get bulk deals on storage. It was nice and profitable if you were lucky enough to hear about it in the early days and had the equipment to fill your spare storage with plots very quickly. What's happened since is those early wins have fueled a bunch of FOMO lemming behavior to buy drives beyond the
[21:29:47] <Myself> point of profitability. I hope it collapses and farmers dump a bunch of drives on the used market. 
[21:34:37] <Snuupy> same then cheap HDDs for everyone :D

[23:51:29] <skye0> they still need to be called out regardless of the medium and context
[23:51:52] <SoF> when did this surface?
[23:52:02] <SoF> ubisoft harboring rapists
[23:52:13] <skye0> actually it was ages ago that there was news about ubi having rapists in their company
[23:52:30] <x10> you called for the death of all people working in publishing.
[23:52:45] <skye0> well, publishers are fucking greedy
[23:52:53] <skye0> and are why data hoarding can be difficult for us too
[23:52:54] <x10> well the rapist is gone
[23:52:54] <SoF> did ubisoft know they were rapists?
[23:53:02] <skye0> they benefit from and lobby for shit copyright laws
[23:53:09] <x10> got booted when it came out

[23:54:30] <SoF> you're managing a school. a teacher turns out to be a pedophile. do you blame the principal?
[23:54:36] <SoF> ridiculous.
[23:55:33] <evilgohan2> Depends: did the principal know about it? If they did, what actions did they take?
[23:55:39] <SoF> yes, I agree
[23:55:48] <SoF> but supposedly they did not
[23:55:58] <evilgohan2> Then I do not blame the principal.
