[00:05:06] <technomancy> a guarantee of bytecode compatibility across every JVM means that you have a lot less freedom in how you implement the JVM
[00:05:26] <technomancy> like PUC Lua, LuaJIT, and Rembulan all work very differently but they all implement the same language
[00:06:02] <technomancy> with the JVM you have OpenJDK and its forks, and ... basically nothing else, because it's too big a job. (though bytecode compatibility is only one part of why it's hard)
[00:17:30] <tatsumaru> decisions, decisions
[00:30:28] <tatsumaru> in my noob opinion one language shouldn't be too flexible in what use cases it can serve, that's why you have different languages. my intuition is that if languages don't try to please everyone, it will be easier to guarantee certain things.

[01:26:37] <goodger> does it matter that there's only one JDK implementation and essentially only one JVM?
[01:26:58] <goodger> the platform sustains considerable variety of hosted languages despite the underlying monoculture
[01:27:26] <goodger> uhh... does it matter apart from the fact that the one JDK implementation is owned by oracle, I mean
[01:30:09] <TMA> there were other implementations historically, IBM had one, IIRC; they did not keep up to date with new JVM versions though.
[01:32:09] <technomancy> ironically android is the other big JVM deployment and it doesn't work at all with clojure
[01:34:41] <aphyr> It's not JVM, is it?
[01:34:52] <aphyr> They had that whole "well Dalvik is its own VM" thing
[01:34:54] <TMA> it is not a JVM or so Google argues
[01:35:08] <technomancy> definitions are tricky things I guess
[01:35:13] <technomancy> it's certainly not hotspot
[01:35:40] <aphyr> oh my god it actually rewrites jvm bytecode from .class files
[01:35:44] <technomancy> it's a virtual machine that runs java, and so hence in some sense it's a java virtual machine
[01:35:45] <aphyr> baeldung.com/java-jvm-vs-dvm
[01:37:39] <technomancy> but it's not like ... Java® Product

[14:53:44] <tatsumaru> hey guys, if you remove java interop, would clojure still be a valuable language?
[15:03:46] <ridcully> will be hard to do useful things without interop
[15:04:57] <tatsumaru> ridcully: not enough native clojure libraries?
[15:05:25] <ridcully> and what would those libraries interop with?
[15:05:46] <ridcully> how would be print a character on your screen?  or send a packet out on your NIC?
[15:05:50] <tatsumaru> ridcully: hmm I thought java interop meant clojure's ability to use java libraries
[15:07:26] <goodger> it also means clojure's ability to use the java standard library
[15:11:35] <opqdonut> tatsumaru: yes, see clojurescript
[15:11:47] <opqdonut> also SCI, babashka
[15:11:55] <ridcully> or clj on clr
[15:13:04] <tatsumaru> Oh babashka looks like a really cool idea
[15:15:45] <wink> tatsumaru: when people "say" Java Interop, they mostly mean the syntax of calling e.g. (Integer/parseInt "3") or thse (.method) chains - but that's only most of the time
[15:16:31] <wink> but as the others pointed ouyt, there's basically Java (JVM) classes all the way down. Integer, Long, String, ...

[16:12:01] <sobel> tatsumaru: a related question, which you might be interested in, is how much you can get done without using interop directly
[16:13:58] <sobel> tatsumaru: highly related question: what clojure libraries run on both jvm and cljs?
[16:16:20] <sobel> clojure is the only ecosystem that has really appealed to me for attempting to use the same language, much less the same libraries/codebase, front and back ends
[16:19:30] <tatsumaru> sobel: what is cljs
[16:19:54] <goodger> clojurescript
[16:21:14] <sobel> clojure hosted on javascript
[16:23:41] <tatsumaru> is cljs also compiled
[16:28:56] <ridcully> it's transformed to javascript using the google closure tools (watch out for the naming here...)
[16:28:57] <croeso[m]> compiled to js if you like
[16:39:12] <tatsumaru> is this the same as "transpiled"

[16:59:36] <AnnArcana> cljs is compiled to javascript by a compiler written in cljs
[17:00:08] <AnnArcana> closure is an optimization stage sorta, it takes the initial JS and applies an additional JS->JS compilation 
[17:00:55] <AnnArcana> i think closure is only still used in the mainline compiler anymore even? lumo/planck/etc. don't use the google libraries anymore i think

[17:16:41] <tatsumaru> if I wanted to write a script which configures emacs for clojure work on new linux systems, what kind of language would be best suited for writing said script?
[17:17:01] <yeik-the-spik[m]> emacs lisp
[17:17:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> because it just runs on your emacs
[17:18:18] <yeik-the-spik[m]> and I do not think there is much contention on what is the best emacs scripting language anyways
[17:18:41] <tatsumaru> i see, thanks
[17:25:47] <yeik-the-spik[m]> <tatsumaru> "hey guys, if you remove java..." <- The main reason I use Clojure and not Racket or Common Lisp is interop.
[17:25:47] <yeik-the-spik[m]> - I've used Clojure on inherited Java projects (cause I cant Java).
[17:25:47] <yeik-the-spik[m]> - It gives me peace of mind when I know there is a JVM/js library for whatever need might arise on a given project.
[17:26:40] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Not saying that Clojure is not valuable. But for me, with interop, there is very little contention on my lisp of choice

[18:18:21] <wink> if you can call it like a lib it seems fine.
[18:20:32] <tatsumaru> wink: you can call a whole app as a lib?
[18:21:17] <tatsumaru> wait that didn't make sense - libs are apps.
[18:21:52] <wink> if your java code exposed classes and methods to be called, you can work with it just from clojure
[18:22:22] <wink> I did that once. our main product was a big jar of an app and I just wrote a "lightweight" clojure interface
[18:22:39] <wink> and this was fine, I didn't have to reimplement anything
[18:22:59] <tatsumaru> is it hard to have to switch between imperative and functional when working with both java and clojure?
[18:30:23] <wink> I'm the wrong person ot ask that, I'm just a noob amateur when it comes to clojure :)

[18:47:50] <ridcully> the OO part is way harder to stomach with time.  with things like lombok and vavr you can write quite functional code with java too.

[19:06:23] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Situation was similar to what wink . Using the Java bits from Clojure was fine. Calling Clojure functions from Java was kinda ugly. But not that I knew what I was doing.

[20:17:56] <Para> parenthesis
[20:20:43] <tatsumaru> i used to hate on new paradigms when I was younger. I think it was just an expression of my laziness (i.e. oh no the world's changing, I might have to learn something new). eventually after some self-awareness kicked in I let go of that petty behavior.
[20:22:34] <tatsumaru> i try to keep my identity small nowadays, don't identify with the country I was born or with the profession I am doing or with the language I might be using, I just see it as tools and enjoy it if it does the job better than another tool.

[20:27:39] <selfsymmetric-mu> I wrote a Dijkstra today for Advent of Code, that was fun.
[20:27:51] <selfsymmetric-mu> and fast!
[20:29:02] <selfsymmetric-mu> Wasn't sure what to use for a min-heap though…I ended up using clojure.data.priority-map but I feel like there should be something in core that has the right O-complexity.
[20:30:09] <selfsymmetric-mu> Oh aha, I should have used `sorted-map`. 
[20:30:21] <selfsymmetric-mu> And reversed my keys and values.

[22:30:22] <technomancy> sure but I'd imagine people would want to see how others solved it
[22:30:35] <selfsymmetric-mu> Ah, true, but there's Reddit for GitHub for that, I suppose.
[22:30:51] <selfsymmetric-mu> Someone's solving them in Excel. Someone else is making custom hardware. 
[22:30:52] <technomancy> not that they have to run it but just to display for comparison
