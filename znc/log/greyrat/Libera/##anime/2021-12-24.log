[00:13:35] <HeTo> Satin: input method is if you want to write Japanese or Chinese or languages like that, or use an onscreen keyboard, or the like, input that is more complex than what is directly supported with just a keyboard
[00:14:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Shit like ibus which allows you to type other languages & mappings.
[00:14:24] * Satin uses COLEMAK ...
[00:14:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Whether that's mappings that can fit on your keyboard like Russian instead of English... or more complicated ones that compose syllables like Japanese IMEs usually do
[00:14:54] <Bco1981> that sounds like something you eat
[00:15:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Emacs has its own built-in IME.

[00:19:50] <emmeka> Satin Colemak isn't input method. I'm pretty sure any Colemak keyboard, at a hardware level, is just a US ANSI QWERTY keyboard. It's just the keyboard layout on your OS that's interpretting the keystrokes differently.
[00:20:06] <emmeka> I type with US International AltGr Deadkeys, which is input method
[00:20:11] <Satin> ooh
[00:20:57] <emmeka> So for example, √† for me is altgr+grave/tilde key+a
[00:20:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ehh... that's not exactly right.
[00:21:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> An IME remaps input at a different layer.
[00:21:21] *** Joins: ale2183 (~ale2183@user/ale2183)
[00:21:22] <emmeka> which part isn't right?
[00:21:28] *** Quits: ale2183 (~ale2183@user/ale2183) (Client Quit)
[00:22:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The keyboard mapping is at a lower level and then its output gets fed into the IME. But the IME is quite capable of remapping qwerty input to emulated colemak or that other popular one
[00:22:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dvorak, right
[00:22:44] <emmeka> I'm still not sure what you're objecting to
[00:23:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: There's no such thing as a colemak keyboard. It's a matrix of positions and keypress events. The OS interprets that at first layer.
[00:23:37] <emmeka> but that's what I just said
[00:24:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's no such thing as an ANSI QWERTY keyboard either...
[00:24:18] <MootPoot> emmeka: he said it in bigger words
[00:24:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But the part I'm objecting to is the statement that colemak/dvorak/whatever cannot be your IME.
[00:25:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> While it can perfectly well be implemented that way.
[00:25:53] <emmeka> I mean it is technically possible, but this is not how it is done
[00:26:29] <Urchin[emacs]> yeah, I use IME to convert from colemak to other stuff
[00:26:34] <Urchin[emacs]> like greek and japanese
[00:27:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Any time you see me typing Russian, I'm using Emacs' IME because I can't be assed to set it up properly.
[00:27:27] <Urchin[emacs]> though if I used cyrilic, I'd probably go via serbian, as it's qwertz-based cyrilic layout
[00:27:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Though this is partly because on Qubes I'd need to set up IME for every single VM I use which I really don't feel like.
[00:27:36] <emmeka> I'm gonna retrain myself one of these days to type with Eurokey, and then I can do Greek too, if I want
[00:27:49] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: why not quartz based instead 
[00:28:01] <emmeka> for now I can touch type all French diacritics on US International
[00:28:06] <MootPoot> Ew
[00:28:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Whereas in Emacs it's as simple as C-u C-\ russian-computer
[00:28:33] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: eh, colemak has good international support

[00:39:19] <ImoutoBot> Jigsy: Your current picks | Anime of the Week: Kakegurui
[00:40:03] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] because most anglo Canadians just get US hardware and so for them, the key beside right shift is / ?
[00:40:10] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: on croatian layout question mark is right of 0, shifted
[00:40:22] <emmeka> seems annoying
[00:40:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Honestly, for anyone who learned proper typing, there's no need for the letters to be printed on the keyboard, just the two nubs/tabs on the two sides of the homerow.
[00:41:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Proper typing = Touch-typing
[00:41:35] <emmeka> unless you have ten bazillion special characters, which I do
[00:41:43] <emmeka> I've memorized most of them, but still
[00:41:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You're supposed to learn to touch-type them as well.
[00:42:04] <Urchin[emacs]> I've learned to touch type dead keys as well (the most used one at least)
[00:42:06] <emmeka> I can touch type all French ones, at least
[00:42:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some IMEs also use postfix insertion with vaguely-similar diacritics.
[00:42:49] <emmeka> but it also doesn't help that I have to know multiple keyboard layouts, my wife does use Canadian Multilingual
[00:43:31] <emmeka> and everytime I need to do something in terminal on her PC it's like "where the fuck is |"
[00:43:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For french-postfix in Emacs, a + ` = √†

[03:35:17] <markon101> Guess that is how cases are so low
[03:35:34] <markon101> Australia says no more lockdowns etc. They are gonna let it loose
[03:37:03] <amigojapan> markon101: actually in Japan we hardly had anything like a lockdown. Restaurants were closing at 8pm at a certain point but that is over
[03:37:12] <markon101> That is good
[03:37:20] <Cryowolf> what would you guys say the risk of burnin on an LG 65" OLEDB1 when using it as a computer monitor with windows etc and the static images showing for upwards to 6-8 hours a day + games + movies/tv/anime? Probably for its entire lifetime?
[03:37:22] <markon101> I guess masking is still widly used thoguh
[03:37:37] <Cryowolf> so it wil spend 12 or so hours a day turned on

[03:38:17] <markon101> Cryowolf: I don't know what the specs are but you could definitely see some burn in if you are often displaying static images. 
[03:38:28] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: why not use a screen saver?
[03:38:49] <Cryowolf> markon101, well the specs is that it's an oled
[03:39:03] <markon101> The LEDs probably have 100,000 hours of lifespan 
[03:39:03] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, when I'm not at the computer yes

[03:39:28] <Cryowolf> there's a huge difference in lcd-led and oleg
[03:39:31] <Cryowolf> oled
[03:39:45] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: also try to use dark mode
[03:39:48] <Cryowolf> oled has a much higher risk for burnin, question I'm trying to answer is how much
[03:40:32] <markon101> I would say burning pure white is going to speed up the degredation by likely double digit. My phone screen has mild burn in displaying some static content at the top  of it. Pure white or pure blue may burn it in faster.
[03:40:34] <Cryowolf> dark mode wont do that much, I'm trying to decide between oled and mni-led
[03:40:35] *** Joins: blakesmith (blakesmith@tilde.team)
[03:40:43] <Cryowolf> cause min-led has no burnin risk
[03:40:43] <Cryowolf> zero
[03:40:52] <markon101> Mini-led will last you longest for sure
[03:41:12] <Cryowolf> and its why I was drawn to it. I'm often bed ridden and in bed I use my tv as a computer monitor
[03:41:18] <Cryowolf> and to play or watch media
[03:41:35] <markon101> If you can live with burn in after a year or two the OLED will be okay. 
[03:41:42] <Cryowolf> I can't
[03:42:01] <Cryowolf> i'm the type of person very very very distracted by such things
[03:42:03] <markon101> Definitely need to get the mini led. 
[03:42:11] <Cryowolf> yeah
[03:42:23] <Cryowolf> I'll go for the TCL c825 then unless the x925 drops in price
[03:42:30] <markon101> It even bothers me on my AMOLED phone 
[03:42:33] <Cryowolf> or the samsung qn90 drops a lot
[03:42:41] <Cryowolf> but I doubt it will
[03:42:43] <markon101> That sounds good
[03:42:49] <Cryowolf> and the tcl is pretty damn good
[03:43:07] <markon101> Always just make sure they support full res 4:4:4 chroma subsampling 
[03:43:20] <markon101> Otherwise text will look bad
[03:43:30] <markon101> I use a TV as a monitor too
[03:43:32] <Cryowolf> 120hz, <9 latency, FALD, 5000:1 contrast without HDR, HDR10+, dolby vision, 10bit
[03:43:37] <Cryowolf> 180ish dimming zones

[09:46:53] <ButterNoodle> I actually would rather have the 2 3/4" 500 mag for that
[09:47:03] <MootPoot> stopped handing out permits for it because "they dont think they are powerful enough"

[09:47:16] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:47:20] <ButterNoodle> thats dumb

[09:47:51] <MootPoot> they did that with hunting as well, sure you can take a deer with .223 rem but they made it only .224 and bigger

[09:48:07] <ButterNoodle> ^while hiking
[09:48:14] <MootPoot> since some idiot was eventually gonna try and shoot a bear with a 223 FMJ or something

[09:48:24] <ButterNoodle> hunting wise.. indiana dont care.
[09:48:45] <MootPoot> I hear you can take deer with special 223 loads but for most  people they're gonna use store bought crap

[13:03:03] <emmeka> I was pretty impressed with the anime. Not many real shoujo these days.
[13:03:09] <emmeka> anyway, I'm off

[13:03:26] <amigojapan> Ok bye
[13:03:39] <zoidberg> takarazuka revue is good!
[13:03:40] <emmeka> it's about a semi-fictional version of the theatre school where they train the actresses
[13:03:48] <emmeka> which exists irl

[19:14:27] <zoidberg> I haven't watched Kiznavier but I heard of it. It's an action anime, isn't it?

[19:16:44] <zoidberg> FMAB is truer to manga while FMA came when the manga was ongoing so it has drifted from the story
