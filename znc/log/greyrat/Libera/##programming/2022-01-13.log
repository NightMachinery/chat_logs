[05:48:31] <Jong> apotheon  what are your favorites ?
[05:48:38] <pulse> tomathy, the learning journey
[05:48:38] <apotheon> I like many languages.
[05:49:04] <Jong> I look at python at a convenience language for cpp. Everything in python calls cpp code
[05:49:12] <apotheon> Those I use most often at this time are (in alphabetical order) awk, C, Ruby, and sh.
[05:49:15] <tomathy> pulse: yes but implementing it yourself can just involve writing code for pseudocode, it's not original or creative
[05:49:36] <Jong> apotheon I focus on ML/AI.  Python is the defacto standard
[05:50:02] <pulse> tomathy, invent a reason - use it in your project ;)
[05:50:11] <apotheon> Oh, yeah, for the non-research stuff I guess Python is where the libraries live.
[05:50:15] <Jong> Often the specialization dictates the language.
[05:50:20] <apotheon> another reason to not get into that field
[05:50:31] <apotheon> The only Python dev I ever enjoyed was with Flask.
[05:50:47] <Jong> apotheon  you're critical of cpp, yet you list C ?
[05:50:52] <apotheon> yep
[05:50:57] <apotheon> C is my favorite video game.
[05:51:26] <Jong> sometimes they're almost the same when the programming isn't polymorphic.
[05:51:31] <apotheon> I tend to like languages that have a fairly consistent internal philosophy.
[05:51:40] <pulse> i would use C more if it had a stdlib comparable to c+++
[05:51:51] <PlanckWalk> Yes, you can write C++ as if it were C
[05:51:56] <pulse> i try to use C, and then i see i don't have std::string, and i'm like, ugh
[05:51:58] <apotheon> I don't have much of a problem with writing C in C++, though at that point I don't really see . . . the point.
[05:51:58] <PlanckWalk> But there's not much point in that
[05:52:23] <pulse> what if it turns out that C++ compilers make faster output for C code :D
[05:52:26] <apotheon> right, not much point
[05:52:29] <pulse> wouldn't that be funny
[05:52:35] <apotheon> It's the rest of C++ that I dislike, really.
[05:52:43] <apotheon> It's easiest to avoid the rest by just compiling C.
[05:52:46] <pulse> you have to admit templates are quite nice
[05:52:55] <apotheon> No, I don't.
[05:52:58] <pulse> as long as you don't overuse them to build a multidimensional spiral
[05:53:05] <pulse> well, i like them a lot
[05:53:08] <pulse> one of the appeals of c++
[05:53:22] <apotheon> Maybe I'd like them more if they were their own language.
[05:53:29] <pulse> they kind of are
[05:53:33] <PlanckWalk> Some aspects of templates are okay, but they're way too flexible (and do get flexed until they break)
[05:53:33] <apotheon> They'd probably have better syntax then, too.
[05:53:52] <PlanckWalk> Better syntax would be nice
[05:53:58] <pulse> ok at least admit that std::vector is nice then :D
[05:54:30] <apotheon> Some languages I like but don't get to use are things like Io, Logo, Prolog, Scheme, and Standard ML.
[05:54:35] <PlanckWalk> The capabilities it provides are nice.
[05:54:44] <PlanckWalk> The syntax and everything else about them sucks
[05:55:15] <apotheon> For Logo, I specifically mean UCBLogo.
[05:55:21] <Jong> apotheon  it seems that what you don't like are the coders, not the language.  It probably irritates you when you see complexity added for no reason other than the programmer thinks it's cool and wants to use what he/she learned in school.  
[05:55:31] <pulse> i think syntax in c++ is a bit of an acquired taste

[05:56:41] <PlanckWalk> I do use vectors (and other standard library structures) substantially in my C++ code, but as soon as you do anything even slightly interesting with them, it's gross.
[05:56:47] <pulse> Jong, if you want a nice taste of C++ complexity, implement custom iterators

[05:59:09] <PlanckWalk> You will have to mix the new stuff with the old for decades due to libraries and other existing code, and it will *suck*
[05:59:45] <apotheon> Part of the problem with C++ is also just the fact that it feels so damned inconsistent.  It's more like two dozen different languages mashed together than just one language.
[05:59:51] <PlanckWalk> In practice, you'll need to know all of it, large parts of it basically incompatible with the rest.

[06:01:14] <apotheon> I don't think anyone agrees with Jong . . .
[06:01:16] <apotheon> I'm surprised.
[06:01:32] <PlanckWalk> tomathy: There are statistical tests that give some evidence for having been shuffled, but only probabilistic.
[06:01:33] <apotheon> (That's not sarcasm.)
[06:01:38] <apotheon> (Neither was that.)
[06:01:38] <arahael> Jong: The "crap" started coming in during the time of "C with classes".
[06:02:10] <apotheon> tomathy: Given that being shuffled is supposed to produce random ordering, it's unprovable.
[06:02:17] <apotheon> In some cases, it can be disprovable.
[06:02:27] <tomathy> PlanckWalk: what kind of stats does my deck of cards need for me to be confident
[06:02:27] <PlanckWalk> As in things like "a uniformly randomly shuffled deck has only a 0.00x% chance of being this extreme on this statistic"
[06:03:15] <apotheon> It's possible that a random shuffle will produce each suit, one after another, perfectly ordered from Ace to King.
[06:03:16] <Jong> I think the future of cpp will be better. I'm predicting a return to simplicity philosophy will come about as the older gen dies away and newer gen takes over
[06:03:18] <PlanckWalk> If you do a bunch of tests and all of them are not terribly extreme, maybe it really was randomly shuffled.
[06:03:21] <apotheon> How do you prove that was shuffled?
[06:03:37] <PlanckWalk> Or maybe it was someone trying to fool you.

[06:04:04] <PlanckWalk> (and can guess what sort of tests you might do)
[06:04:18] <apotheon> I'm probably going to have to write some C++ this year.
[06:04:44] <tomathy> apotheon: i would say a nice statistic would be the average difference between each card in sequence
[06:04:53] <PlanckWalk> But if you suspect that, say, the 13th card in the deck was chosen by someone before they handed you the deck, there's no test yuo can do on the deck itself to say one way or the other.

[06:05:11] <apotheon> tomathy: Sure, but that could just result in a false positive.
[06:05:19] <apotheon> . . . or a false negative.
[06:05:36] <apotheon> Randomness comes with probabilities, but not certainties.
[06:06:01] <apotheon> oldlaptop: nice
[06:06:07] <tomathy> apotheon: if i do it millions of times it wont
[06:06:19] <apotheon> That's not necessarily true.
[06:06:24] <oldlaptop> tomathy: No, it "probably" won't.
[06:06:37] <oldlaptop> For a very strong value of "probably", but not one which is the same as "certainly".
[06:06:53] <tomathy> idk even if that's an appropriate statistic
[06:07:33] <tomathy> my reasoning was "unshuffled decks have clumps of similar/close cards"
[06:07:39] <oldlaptop> Shuffle a deck of cards (literally) forever, and you will get apotheon's ordered-deck. (Even that isn't *certain* - I believe the mathematicians call that "almost surely".)
[06:07:56] <PlanckWalk> Pretty much anything can be an appropriate statistic, but some are better than other at detecting various differences in distributions.
[06:08:41] <apotheon> All that checking probability distributions really does for you is tell you whether you need to investigate in a less easy way.
[06:08:49] <PlanckWalk> Unshuffled decks have cards that depend upon the how they were last used.
[06:08:50] <apotheon> (e.g. time-travel surveillance)
[06:09:09] <PlanckWalk> If how they were last used can be random-ish, then so will the deck.
[06:09:28] <PlanckWalk> Trick-taking or matching games tend to end up with clumpy decks
[06:09:42] <tomathy> i think the only way is to see "how different" the deck is to the original
[06:09:43] <PlanckWalk> Some others like Blackjack less so.
[06:09:45] <apotheon> I think it's one time in 170676555274132171974277914691501574771358362295975962674353045737940041855191232907575296 that you'll get a perfectly ordered deck, unless it ends up being more or less often.
[06:09:51] <apotheon> (because randomness)
[06:12:11] <apotheon> The best test of randomness I know is to treat the results like it's ciphertext and determine how many different messages of the appropriate length it could be.
[06:12:32] <apotheon> . . . which is a prohibitively absurd level of difficulty to achieve for nontrivial message lengths.
[06:12:48] <apotheon> that is, coherent messages
[06:13:00] <apotheon> at least, the best test that comes to mind
[06:13:38] <tomathy> i think i have the solution 
[06:13:52] <apotheon> shuffle the cards yourself
[06:13:54] <apotheon> then you'll know
[06:13:55] <tomathy> you test "how different" the supposed shuffled deck is to the original, by calculating the sum distance each card is from its original place
[06:14:16] <oldlaptop> Statistical tests for randomness are a pretty well-studied topic that could (probably?) be productively Web-searched.
[06:14:21] <tomathy> the bigger the sum difference the more shuffled it is
[06:14:28] <apotheon> not necessarily

[06:38:19] <[itchyjunk]> so random suffle doesn't produce the most randomness if randomness is defined as distance from starting point
[06:38:21] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[06:38:30] <[itchyjunk]> idk if randomness is defined like that though
[06:38:37] <tomathy> im too tired
[06:38:40] <oldlaptop> ...meaning that's a silly measure of "randomness", that's the point
[06:38:44] <tomathy> or did i lose
[06:39:14] <tomathy> can't i just exclude your varient, or are there many
[06:39:16] <PlanckWalk> In fact the swap-halves permutation when applied to any other ordering subtracts its sum from its maximum.
[06:39:36] <PlanckWalk> So that proves that the distribution of shuffles is symetric about 1/2 the maximum
[06:40:03] *** Quits: Gaboradon (~Gaboradon@cpe-86-58-57-5.static.triera.net) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:40:27] <PlanckWalk> So the average sum for uniformly random shuffles is exactly half the maximum.
[06:41:05] <tomathy> is this a common metric, distance from original position? or am i its inventor?
[06:41:23] <PlanckWalk> It has been used in some things, but not as a measure of "randomness"
[06:42:55] <tomathy> what things?
[06:43:13] <PlanckWalk> Things like distance measures over vectors

[06:43:53] <tomathy> i guess your point is that it can't get further away than half the total so your symmetrical thing always invalidates it
[06:44:42] <tomathy> what if i throw it across the room and cry
[06:45:33] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't mean it's not useful.  In fact e value near the maximum is just as useful for suspecting that a shuffle is not "random" as a small value.
[06:46:23] <PlanckWalk> In a list of length 2n the maximum is 2n^2 and the average over random shuffles is n^2.  If the result is too far from n^2 then you should suspect that it's not uniformly random.
[06:46:25] <tomathy> <PlanckWalk> In fact the swap-halves permutation when applied to any other ordering subtracts its sum from its maximum.
[06:46:25] <tomathy> <PlanckWalk> So that proves that the distribution of shuffles is symetric about 1/2 the maximum
[06:46:35] <tomathy> i have no idea what this means
[06:47:02] <tomathy> you must be really into statistics
[06:47:18] <PlanckWalk> If you take a deck (or length 2n) and calculate its distance sum as k, then when you swap the halves you get 2n^2-k.
[06:47:22] <PlanckWalk> of* length
[06:48:13] <PlanckWalk> So for every ordering under n^2, there's one above n^2 by an equal amount.
[06:48:40] <PlanckWalk> In practice they probably bunch up around n^2 in something like a bell curve.
[06:49:04] <PlanckWalk> Very few out on the "tails" of minimum and maximum distance sum.
[06:49:12] <tomathy> what's your IQ?
[06:49:18] <PlanckWalk> And yeah, I mess with statistics a *lot*

[23:56:58] <[itchyjunk]> tokerboker, that's Trumps franchise right?
[23:57:10] <tokerboker> [itchyjunk]: noooo.
[23:57:30] <[itchyjunk]> "The pageant was first televised in 1955. CBS began broadcasting the combined Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants in 1960, and as separate contests in 1965. More than 30 years later, Donald Trump bought the pageant in 1996 from ITT Corp, with a broadcasting arrangement with CBS until 2002.[11]"
[23:57:32] <[itchyjunk]> yeah
[23:57:38] <ProfSimm> pulse: as i said earlier our mind works backwards. We see cause in the future, and effect in the present. Except we call it "goal" and "means"
[23:57:46] <tokerboker> noooo. dont spoil my memories [itchyjunk] 
[23:57:50] <ProfSimm> pulse: only minds do that
[23:57:59] <ProfSimm> pulse: we're backwards, man!
[23:58:00] <ProfSimm> :P
[23:58:02] <[itchyjunk]> well memories before 1996 is trump free
[23:58:05] <[itchyjunk]> after that, it's all trump
[23:58:13] <[itchyjunk]> he popularized it quite  a bit i think
[23:58:22] <tokerboker> i was too young at that time to care about memories. i cared about eating mud back then
[23:58:37] <[itchyjunk]> sniffing glue and eating mud, good old days
[23:58:50] <tokerboker> ok so you want me to support trump for next election? is that it?
[23:59:05] <pulse> i think it's better if we support a half broken chair from the early 20s
[23:59:06] *** Joins: yitz (~yitz@exercism/yitz)
[23:59:15] <[itchyjunk]> I said nothing about politics.
[23:59:26] <[itchyjunk]> I said the franchise is owned by that dude
[23:59:47] <epony> Frenchies are now owned?
[23:59:53] <pulse> ProfSimm, some might say the future is a cause of worry and the past the cause of trauma
[23:59:58] <tokerboker> my frenchie is my frenchie. none of your frenchie.
