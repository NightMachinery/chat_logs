[00:35:38] <emmeka> I imagine they did

[01:15:10] <dweltstorm> "Carrot seeds are not true seeds in a botanical sense but are dry fruits called 'schizocarps'. The Carrot is not a fruit in the common understanding, so there are no seeds inside or on the carrot"
[01:15:11] <Bco1981> but when you cut one, you don't see anything that looks like seeds

[01:15:29] <MootPoot> I never fucking knew

[01:16:45] <emmeka> carrots are an angiosperm, a flowering plant, like most plants. as such, they sexually reproduce and set seed the way all flowering plants do: by flowering

[01:17:18] <emmeka> the carrot is a biennial plant. its first year, it just grows leaves and a tasty root vegetable. In its second year, it sends up a flower stalk, flowers, and sets seed
[01:17:30] <dweltstorm> oh cool
[01:17:35] <dweltstorm> i want a carrot flower
[01:17:38] <MootPoot> oh so only 1 year for carrot
[01:17:39] <emmeka> you have seen carrot flowers.
[01:17:46] <emmeka> queen anne's lace.
[01:17:49] <emmeka> a common weed.
[01:17:58] <dweltstorm> yeah they look familiar
[01:18:00] <emmeka> it is in fact the same species as carrots.
[01:18:08] <Bco1981> emmeka: you could have just said it would henshin, and we would have understood
[01:18:18] <emmeka> queen anne's lace is just escaped carrots that have gone weedy and spread everywhere
[01:18:22] *** Quits: dweltstorm (~dweltstor@204.108.107.198) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:18:31] <emmeka> if you dig up queen anne's lace there is a white, very pathetic carrot
[01:18:32] <omero> there are many roots that adopt that strategy to 'propagate'
[01:19:12] <omero> potatoes arent roots, different family
[01:19:46] <emmeka> omero all flowering plants, with the exception of those that for various reasons are sterile and cannot reproduce sexually, propagate this way
[01:19:46] <TsundereNoises> what is the root family?
[01:20:00] <emmeka> omero potatoes do in fact set seed, if you let them.
[01:20:12] <emmeka> or well, can, in certain climates like their native range in the Andes
[01:20:14] <omero> emmeka: true
[01:20:24] <MootPoot> Potatos have seeds too?
[01:20:26] <MootPoot> woah
[01:20:38] <omero> infact the best way to make more potatoes is to have some, slice them and plant them again
[01:20:41] <MootPoot> I hought you just cut them up and put them back into the ground
[01:20:48] <emmeka> in practice you will never see a potato seed growing them, and it isn't practical to grow potatoes from seed
[01:20:53] <MootPoot> since they sprout when left for so long
[01:20:57] <emmeka> but the plant is capable of it, in certain climates
[01:21:09] <snake> MootPoot has redeemed himself
[01:21:28] <emmeka> MootPoot at least you're better than this one girl I encountered out of college

[01:22:17] <emmeka> so immediately after graduating I rented a room at a house in a little town in the lower Ottawa valley, the guy who owned the house was a bus driver in Ottawa, his teenage daughter lived there

[01:23:19] <emmeka> I'm like, those plants right there, those are potatoes
[01:23:32] <emmeka> and she looks confused and says "but there's no potatoes on them"
[01:23:56] <emmeka> and I was like, what? and it took me a minute to realize she expected the potatoes to be *above ground*, on the plant
[01:24:02] <emmeka> like a fruit or something

And then they finally panic-buy again just as it's about to tank for real.

[04:54:33] <Nanobot> I'm a profit
[05:06:57] <tcsilver> did you make an aweful lot ? :D
[05:07:13] <tcsilver> or such
[05:08:55] <Nanobot> I made enough in 2017 to pay off my mortgage and reinvest what I had left over. And my hope is that I'll have enough at the end of the year to retire.
[05:09:39] <tcsilver> wow!
[05:09:42] <Nanobot> I *technically* have enough to retire if I cash out right now, but with not as much risk tolerance as I want.
[05:10:12] <tcsilver> pretty nifty!
[05:10:26] <tcsilver> I wonder if you will invest in stocks too ?
[05:10:39] <tcsilver> or gold or something strange like that :)
[05:11:15] <tcsilver> I'm pretty amazed by your success!
[05:11:48] <tcsilver> maybe I should invest more
[05:11:59] <Nanobot> My plan is to sell around 13 bitcoins at $100k, which, combined with what I've already cashed out, will give me enough to pay taxes and live off a traditional 10% annual yield investment. I then hope to sell my remaining bitcoins at a higher price and use that money for future bitcoin trading.
[05:12:50] <tcsilver> sounds like a very solid plan.
[05:14:58] <Nanobot> I've never invested more than I could afford to lose. If my bitcoins were to all suddenly disappear, I'd still have enough money in the bank to pay the taxes on the gains I've made and have a comfortable money buffer in the bank. It just means that I wouldn't be able to retire.

[05:18:06] <tcsilver> so fascinating... which bitcoins do you recommend I buy ?
[05:18:12] <tcsilver> and how to judge when to buy
[05:19:04] <tcsilver> maybe I should just stick with our traditional investments :D

[06:50:42] <isekaijin> Why?
[06:52:07] <isekaijin> In any case, Danbooru's rules say that you cannot upload your own art. Someone else has to appreciate your art enough to upload it there.
[06:54:30] <isekaijin> And then it has to be approved by a user with the permission / privilege to approve posts. Unapproved posts are automatically deleted after a period of time.

[07:03:19] <isekaijin> And their level when they began was, like, ‚Äúgive up, do something else‚Äù.
[07:03:33] <isekaijin> And they currently make breathtakingly beautiful stuff.
[07:03:44] <jessedesu2> I mean
[07:03:49] <jessedesu2> I lack charm

[07:04:22] <jessedesu2> I use brute force sculptural drawing to get cuteness
[07:05:09] <jessedesu2> I feel like I overwork my lines but I cannot get any more efficient at it
[07:06:59] <Roey> let's copy WLOP :)
[07:07:48] <isekaijin> Drawing is super hard. While I do not have to make any actual drawings in my day job, I have to sketch things, and they have to look ‚Äúdecent enough‚Äù. And I often only get it right in the tenth or something attempt.
[07:08:23] <jessedesu2> What do you draw
[07:09:02] <emmeka> now that it's winter I should draw more
[07:09:18] <isekaijin> I have to sketch 3D objects, like ‚Äúthe solid that you get by cutting this cube with this curved surface‚Äù.
[07:09:51] <jessedesu2> I had too much caffeine
[07:09:55] <jessedesu2> I feel weird
[07:10:00] <isekaijin> So this requires less skill than actually drawing people or landscapes. And it is hard already.

[07:33:05] <jessedesu2> What about BS'ing
[07:33:35] <isekaijin> jessedesu2: The only things that you get are the ability to search more tags simultaneously and a role in their Discord server. So it depends on how much you value these things.
[07:33:58] <isekaijin> The good thing is that it is a fixed cost. You only pay once, get the benefits forever.
[07:34:08] <jessedesu2> How much
[07:34:25] <isekaijin> I do not remember, it was 50 USD, I think?
[07:34:41] <jessedesu2> I can never put a search word and have a result
[07:34:52] <jessedesu2> I get the nothing but us chickens error
[07:35:09] <isekaijin> Oh, 40 USD.

[07:36:18] <isekaijin> jessedesu2: You have to search exact tags, not substrings of tags.
[07:36:41] <jessedesu2> What's the difference
[07:37:13] <isekaijin> So, for example, if the tag you want is ‚Äúxyz‚Äù but you only enter ‚Äúxy‚Äù, you will get nothing related to ‚Äúxyz‚Äù.
[07:37:28] <jessedesu2> I type in exactly
[07:37:36] <jessedesu2> Still get chickens
[07:37:41] <isekaijin> Weird.
[07:37:55] <jessedesu2> Google as a gateway works
[07:38:00] <isekaijin> I am trying it in incognito mode, to simualate being an unpaid user.
[07:38:06] <jessedesu2> I use incognito ofcourse
[07:38:55] <isekaijin> It seems to work just fine. So it is most likely either a problem with your browser or with your ISP.
[07:39:06] <isekaijin> And my guess would be the former.
[07:39:09] <jessedesu2> Firefox
[07:39:45] <MootPoot> hmm
[07:39:54] <isekaijin> By ‚Äúyour browser‚Äù, I mean ‚Äúyour browser configuration. Maybe you have an addon that does not let Danbooru work correctly or something like that.

[07:40:54] <ButterNoodle> where did you hear that?
[07:41:18] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they show ads for themselves on your browser
[07:41:32] <amigojapan> popups
[07:41:44] <isekaijin> Are popups still a thing?
[07:41:57] <isekaijin> I have not seen a popup in ages.

[07:42:10] <Roey> just saying.
[07:42:12] <amigojapan> probably from ad blokers jesse
[07:42:17] <isekaijin> So I figured web developers must have stopped making them at some point in time.
[07:42:30] <isekaijin> But apparently that is not the case.
[07:42:39] <MootPoot> isekaijin: popups no, but clickovers are 
[07:42:53] <isekaijin> Ah.
[07:43:01] <MootPoot> Which may turn into a popup depending on your browser settings 
[07:43:05] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: lol
[07:43:40] <ButterNoodle> I never see ads.. ublock origin and ghostry.. one is probably blocking the other
[07:43:52] <amigojapan> just use u block origin
[07:44:05] <ButterNoodle> bet u still see ads
[07:44:09] <MootPoot> Assign multiple layers over a link you actually want to go to with JS, with a z hight overriding the other ones 
[07:44:27] <MootPoot> So you click on the invisible JavaScript box instead of the actual button 
[07:44:50] <MootPoot> And since a click triggered it your browser thinks this is okay and opens it up

[11:11:25] <Bco1981> then i looked it up, and true. some other more well known model creator had made the exact same combo.

[11:14:07] <jessedesu_onaph> Sigh
[11:14:20] <Bco1981> well it's not just black and white like that. there are many modellers that made their own parts, and they often say "you are not allowed to copy this" or do this with this part.
[11:14:41] <Bco1981> so if you want to follow all rules. it's very hard to make anything,
[11:15:02] <Bco1981> hence. alot of the stuff i make, i don't upload anywhere
[11:15:14] <jessedesu_onaph> I bet
[11:15:33] <jessedesu_onaph> I wanna make models but not rig them for motion
[11:15:48] <Bco1981> sometimes i post a mediafire link to a video. that's because something in that video was not allowed.
[11:16:24] <Bco1981> usually it's because there was not allowed to edit the model.
[11:17:31] <jessedesu_onaph> Shit is complicated
[11:18:05] <Bco1981> not really. if you put stuff up for download, you have to expect people to use it.
[11:18:48] <Bco1981> i get the restrictions of, not using the model for slander, violence or stuff like that.
[11:19:35] <Bco1981> but to expect people not to convert to other platforms, or not make small edits for what ever reason they need this edit.

[15:51:41] <isekaijin> Yeah, ‚Äúpa‚Äù (pinyin: ‚ÄúbƒÅ‚Äù, but pinyin ‚Äúb‚Äù means the sound ‚Äúp‚Äù) is the sound I normally associate ‚ÄúÂÖ´‚Äù with.

[16:35:59] <amigojapan> It's meant to be artistic I think darkwitch 
[16:36:10] <darkwitch> this isn't how china intended it to be used
[16:36:48] <amigojapan> I think China has only one reading or Kanji
[16:37:06] <amigojapan> Per Kanji
[16:39:54] <Urchin[emacs]> well, China has multiple spoken languages per writing system
[16:40:03] <Sadale> amigojapan, nope
[16:40:13] <Sadale> amigojapan, Each kanji can have multiple readings. But thoes are rare.
[16:40:39] <darkwitch> also, korean writing can be learned in a day, while japanese takes a lifetime because they are such artists
[16:40:49] <Sadale> lol
[16:41:09] <Sadale> aw I should find a time to revise, document and publish my Sadalian script.
[16:42:12] <Sadale> Basically it's a writing system for Cantonese that I've designed. But I'm not trained to read nor to write them. So the only feasible way for me to write the script is to generate it using a python script that I wrote
[16:45:26] <Urchin[emacs]> darkwitch: afaik, it takes about 10 years to get decent with reading kanji
[16:45:49] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: make an input method
[16:46:04] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], I actually have made that. :P
[16:46:08] <darkwitch> Urchin[emacs], the problem is not recognizing the characters but knowing what sound you are supposed to make
[16:46:10] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: that is probably basic level 10 years
[16:46:11] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], but I'm not sure if it's still working
[16:47:09] <darkwitch> you can read something and understand the meaning but still have no idea how to pronounce it
[16:47:33] <omero> thats so sadly true, darkwitch 
[16:48:10] <Urchin[emacs]> darkwitch: you're supposed to learn that in parallel
[16:48:14] <omero> I learned several languages in 'read-only' mode, had no clue how the language sounded like
[16:48:49] <darkwitch> difficult to learn if people can treat it as art and come up with weird readings on their own
[16:49:04] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:49:04] <Urchin[emacs]> well, English was the first language for me that isn't written as it's spoken, handled it fine :P
[16:49:49] <omero> but the reverse is also true. one can 'learn' how to talk in a language, yet ... not how to write it properly
[16:51:05] <Sadale> I used to have this problem for English. I couldn't really listen to it back then
[16:51:22] <omero> I can pick up a language rather easily... just listening to the 'sounds' ... phonema... problem: how would I write it?
[16:51:32] <Sadale> I mean I could listen to it only if it's spoken in certain accent in dog slow pace
[16:52:19] <Sadale> omero, I think it isn't uncommon for people who learn Chinese without learning the writing system.
[16:52:20] <Urchin[emacs]> I first learned spoken English from movies, and learned how it's spelled afterwards
[16:52:23] <omero> I think I have a basic grasp of english

[16:53:20] <Urchin[emacs]> the advantage in kanji is that it lets you show off just by knowing it :P

[17:01:31] <omero> I know I know...
[17:01:47] <amigojapan> Why summer?
[17:02:02] <omero> we're only separated by a few waves :)
[17:02:16] <omero> because of the sea, amigojapan 
[17:02:23] <amigojapan> Ah
[17:02:55] <omero> its a very narrow 'sea' actually
[17:03:06] <amigojapan> Is the sea calm in summer? Or are you talking about the beaches?
[17:03:33] <omero> yes, summer is the best season for both reasons :)
[17:03:44] <omero> infact, its perfect
[17:03:44] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[17:03:57] <omero> it would be perfect... 
[17:04:03] <darkwitch> beaches are dangerous in fall, as you found out
[17:04:15] <amigojapan> omero: don't eat at the beach in Japan. It's dangerous
[17:04:28] <omero> a good swimmer could manage traversing from one shore of italy to the other ... almost effortlessly

[17:06:56] <amigojapan> I see darkwitch . We will go back in a week
[17:07:04] <darkwitch> there are no trees on the beach, so they can not fall there
[17:07:25] <omero> dont you have bamboo on beaches, amigojapan ?
[17:08:10] <omero> well... not real bambooo... I mean... not that kind
[17:08:17] <darkwitch> bamboo in salt water? I think not
[17:08:24] <omero> but here we have beaches that do have vegetation
[17:08:26] <amigojapan> omero: I have not seen bamboo on beaches, but I have been to few beaches in Japan
[17:08:50] <omero> darkwitch: yes... I understand.
[17:09:39] <omero> I should have said ... bamboo-like... but ... you know... there are places where a river meets the sea
[17:09:53] <omero> and you get bamboo-like vegetation
[17:10:20] <omero> dont know the exact common name, for those kind of ... plants
[17:10:36] <omero> but they do host a plethora of wildlife, and birds
[17:11:20] <omero> its a rare thing nowadays, and therefore those areas are protected
[17:11:25] <omero> like reservoirs
[17:11:36] <darkwitch> reeds perhaps

[17:27:02] <ezekielnoob> Sadale maybe i don't know what im talking about tho haha but im assuming that because Cebu is kinda 2nd place in terms of being urban
[17:27:03] <omero> its part of "my" understanding/culture
[17:27:32] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, ah. So I guess Manila takes the first place. Cebu is the 2nd largest city there.
[17:27:40] <ezekielnoob> yep
[17:28:05] <ezekielnoob> manila is way more accessible tho
[17:28:10] <Sadale> I'd imagine Manila would still be quite a bit cheaper than Hong Kong tho :P

[17:28:27] <ezekielnoob> or was it singapore
[17:28:28] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, like super expensive ._.
[17:28:32] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, both.
[17:28:36] <amigojapan> Good good omero . Tomako got meros confused with eros too. Is that a Japanese story or is it Western? Running meros
[17:28:37] <omero> eros is a very important concept... otherwise ancient folks wouldnt have considered it to be included in their stories (whatever form)
[17:28:43] <Sadale> Both are expensive. These world class cites are super expensive

[17:29:23] <ezekielnoob> maybe not
[17:29:28] <Sadale> JesseDesu, that too. I know how expensive it is based on what you told me :P
[17:29:32] <omero> ahm... omero in greek is spelled very differently. it is not even close to eros

[17:30:08] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, You can certainly survive in these major cities as long as you've got a job.
[17:30:35] <Sadale> JesseDesu, pretty much the same would happen here for average people here. Rent's expensive af.
[17:30:51] <Sadale> JesseDesu, I live with my parents tho. So I'm good. :P
[17:30:58] <ezekielnoob> Sadale i think hongkong do pay handsomely for IT positions

[18:33:29] <Jigsy> Or Mexican education or something?
[18:33:37] <ButterNoodle> lewds are illegal in mexico
[18:33:38] <omero> its about having a probe crash on mars because the probe had different measures parameters
[18:33:52] <Sadale> Jigsy, amigojapan said that those lewds people would be labelled as "uneducated" there in Mexico.
[18:34:01] <Jigsy> Ah.
[18:34:12] <Sadale> "Mal educados"
[18:34:14] <Jigsy> To be fair, I wandered in during the middle of the conversation.
[18:34:18] <omero> maleducati
[18:34:47] <omero> albeit raised with the principles, the education program failed 
[18:34:59] <Sadale> speaking of lewds, I remember that when I first joined this channel I was rather innocent xD
[18:35:01] <omero> its a common fault
[18:35:17] <Sadale> now that I've turned into a lewd person. Thanks guys.
[18:35:26] <amigojapan> omero: it's more about how your parents bright you up. But about the education system
[18:35:28] <Jigsy> Way to go, team!

[18:57:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, aliexpress is about as expensive as taobao. But it takes forever to get aliexpress cargo to ship to north america because they usually use surface shipping
[18:57:51] <MootPoot> shipping costs made the actual end of day prices really high
[18:57:58] <MootPoot> 80 cent part has 5 ollar shipping

[19:00:33] <Sadale> well I'm just staying on the safe side. I don't want to break any laws. Despite that it's probably legal (as onaholes are legally sold there), I don't want to break any intercontinental laws.
[19:00:37] <ButterNoodle> they arent gonna send the taliban after u if u get a butt plug or hearts sweet 17 tight onahole in the mail
[19:00:52] <MootPoot> its fine
[19:00:56] <MootPoot> it was a j oke
[19:01:00] <Sadale> Just because it's legal here and legal there in the destination doesn't mean that it'd be legal for me to ship this kind of risky stuffs.
[19:01:07] <MootPoot> but otherwise I have had stuff imported from japan
[19:01:11] <Sadale> lol
[19:01:24] <Jigsy> I've trafficked loli dakis into the UK.
[19:01:28] <Jigsy> Without any issues.
[19:01:35] <ButterNoodle> you cant have that loli sex doll that a lookalike drug.. ur going to jail /s

[21:56:01] <TsundereNoises> I'm not sorry
[21:56:09] <MootPoot> emmeka 1.) it was mostly sarcasm , hence the capitals 2.) wireless mice, certain ones have latency that's close enough that it dosen't matter anymore
[21:56:33] <MootPoot> your 5$ dollar store wireless mouse dosen't count
[21:57:29] <emmeka> I find this ironic considering you made a big fuss about high refresh rates. what's the point of having the ability to react to changes at 120hz if your hardware introduces latency that's not necessary anyway

[21:58:37] *** Joins: mei3 (~mei@user/mei)
[21:59:47] <MootPoot> also, secondly, I dont play FPS games competitively, or any game for that matter, I have a 144hz monitor for the smoothness it offers, not the ability to react to an event faster ( although that is a side benefit )
[22:00:03] <emmeka> with some searching: "Most wireless mice on the market will have around 8‚Äì16 ms of lag... Mice like the Logitech G700s or Razer Mamba allow the computer to have a 1000 Hz polling rate. This can decrease input lag by around 8 ms leaving only the time to encode, transmit and decode the wireless signal."
[22:00:07] <emmeka> 8ms is half a frame
[22:00:43] <Urchin[emacs]> I'd prefer something that doesn't require quick reactions to play
[22:00:50] *** Joins: markkuit (~markkuit@93-43-234-84.ip94.fastwebnet.it)
[22:00:55] <MootPoot> then what's the problem if the mouse can input faster then a frame can be updated?
[22:01:15] <MootPoot> in other words, with the correct wireless mouse, you lose nothing - which is what I said above
[22:01:15] <emmeka> MootPoot because you're using a 144hz monitor, lol
[22:01:25] <MootPoot> ....
[22:01:43] <MootPoot> again, my reasons for buying a 144hz monitor isen't to react faster 
[22:01:47] <MootPoot> its for the smoothness
[22:01:48] <emmeka> 8ms input lag is half a frame of standard 60hz
[22:02:06] <MootPoot> most of the time I end up playing games at like 90fps anyway
[22:02:13] <MootPoot> when the settings are cranked up
[22:02:22] <emmeka> MootPoot last time we had this conversation, you *insisted* that being able to react to high refresh rates made a difference
[22:02:29] <MootPoot> it does
[22:02:41] <MootPoot> but I never said it was important to ME
[22:02:45] <MootPoot> its just a difference that exists
[22:03:44] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.228.11)
[22:03:48] <emmeka> but what's the point of being able to react to changes at say 120hz if it takes 30hz (which is 4 times longer than 120hz) for your reaction to it to do anything

[22:04:59] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: I've never spent much time playing fighting games, but I've always sort of wished I were good at them and had spent time on them
[22:05:02] <MootPoot> even if its by like 2-3 frames
[22:05:03] <TsundereNoises> but not enough to actually do so
[22:05:19] <emmeka> MootPoot not if the other gay has hardware with lower input lag...
[22:05:25] <MootPoot> the other gay?
[22:05:27] <MootPoot> lol
[22:05:32] <emmeka> freudian slip?
[22:05:34] <MootPoot> lol
[22:05:53] <MootPoot> yeah but as I said - I dont play competitively, so you can ask esports players what they use
[22:06:16] <emmeka> but idk it's just really bizarre to me. PC gamers getting bent out of shape about screen refresh rate and reaction time, but they game on hardware with high input lag anyway
[22:06:22] <TsundereNoises> "esports" is maybe the worst new word in the last 10 years
[22:06:46] <emmeka> gimme 240p60 with 0 input lag electrons beamed straight to my eyeballs over that any day
[22:07:06] <Sxem> my tv is just 60 hz
[22:07:15] <MootPoot> I mean, thats a massive generalization
[22:07:26] <MootPoot> most pc gamers just care that their game runs
[22:07:38] <Sxem> i use a wired mouse and wired gamepad tho
[22:07:45] <emmeka> MootPoot and yet they buy these zany 144hz monitors, as you have.
[22:07:54] <MootPoot> yes, because of smoothness
[22:07:59] <MootPoot> I said it like 4 times
[22:08:09] <emmeka> this is the opposite of what you were arguing the other day
[22:08:24] <emmeka> you were swearing up and down that it makes such a *huge* difference to your reaction time etc etc
[22:08:31] <MootPoot> it does
[22:08:31] <emmeka> and yet here you are defending input lag, lol
[22:08:42] <MootPoot> let me put it to you this way
[22:09:24] <MootPoot> my monitor has 86% sRGB coverage , whereas artist pro something monitors that cost the same as mine but are 60hz can do 100%
[22:09:50] <MootPoot> yes it is a difference that exists. Yes it matters to people. Me personally? I'm happy with 86%
[22:10:07] <MootPoot> you're mixing my personal choice with techincal fact
[22:10:49] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I think fighting games went the way of the dodo precisely because of this though, input lag made them less playable
[22:11:50] <MootPoot> Fighting games are still a thing - its just that they tend to be heavily concentrated in SE asia by people who like to do one thing 10million times
[22:12:08] <emmeka> sure, but they still game on retro hardware
[22:12:09] <Sxem> i cd never get into fighting games. i cant do circles or half circles. and entering codes to do moves is alien to me. its like playing a game of simon says to throw a fireball. just let me press a button to do that
[22:12:19] <MootPoot> input lag always exists at some point , nothing is perfect
[22:12:28] <TsundereNoises> yes I can't bring myself to give a shit, but I sort of wish I did because a lot of things about the strategy appeal to me
[22:12:29] <Sxem> i dont want to memorize so much
[22:12:30] <emmeka> MootPoot once upon a time it basically didn't exist
[22:12:33] <TsundereNoises> but not enough for the effort required
[22:12:55] <MootPoot> emmeka: yes, but then we switched to more realistic terms
[22:13:02] <emmeka> now we have modern consoles, digital displays and PCs which introduce assloads of it
[22:13:05] <MootPoot> we dont really argue about input lag anymore in the gaming sphere
[22:13:09] <MootPoot> but end to end latency
[22:13:13] <emmeka> sure we do.
[22:13:18] <MootPoot> from click to action
[22:14:07] <MootPoot> oh, for the wired vs wirelss thing -

[22:14:32] <MootPoot> its basically margin of error
[22:14:35] <MootPoot> as I said, dosen't matter
[22:15:04] <emmeka> this is only a comparison for 1 model that is designed to be used wireless, but even that's a little sad.
[22:15:15] <MootPoot> this is two models
[22:15:27] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: also I love the descriptions on these videos
[22:15:31] <emmeka> yes, compared against themselves
[22:15:32] <emmeka> anyway
[22:15:52] <MootPoot> sure, there are other mice tested
[22:15:52] <emmeka> here's a rule: humans can't really tell when total input lag in the whole chain is below 2 frames.
[22:15:52] <theholyduck> yeah comparing itself against its wireless self doesnt really prove anything
[22:16:28] <emmeka> MootPoot 1 frame is like ~16.5ms, or something.
[22:16:30] <davic> didnt know there was a filipino version of Ed25519 named Ed25519ph
[22:16:50] <emmeka> so basically this both these mice induce about a frame of lag, which is high.
[22:16:51] <MootPoot> the https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/LCuW5GFY/image.png
[22:16:52] <theholyduck> emmeka: thats a end-to end latency though including system and display latency

[22:17:05] <MootPoot> the top two on this
[22:17:09] <theholyduck> emmeka:  ever since nvidia introduced tools for measuring end to end latency 
[22:17:14] <MootPoot> the viper mini is wired - and the ultimate is wireless
[22:17:17] <theholyduck> theres been a lot more of that done
[22:17:30] <emmeka> theholyduck ah, so this is accounting for the display
[22:17:37] <theholyduck> accounting for everything 
[22:17:48] <theholyduck> nvidias tools showed that a lot of latency is just your computer 
[22:17:48] <MootPoot> display, GPU, the whole factory
[22:18:07] <theholyduck> https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform/ emmeka  a while since their original writeup. 
[22:18:08] <ImoutoBot> [title] Introducing NVIDIA Reflex: Optimize and Measure Latency in Competitive Games | GeForce News | NVIDIA
[22:18:14] <theholyduck> but has graphs and info about how they do these measurement
[22:18:16] <MootPoot> but basically, point is, with the correct mouse your mouse is not really a bottleneck
[22:18:45] <TsundereNoises> I don't really care about this, but isn't a bottleneck sort of the wrong model? isn't it more additive?
[22:18:46] <MootPoot> in terms of overall lag -  y ou can argue input lag, but its overshadowed by the total numbers
[22:18:58] <emmeka> TsundereNoises yes.
[22:20:24] <MootPoot> But yes - sure input lag wasen't a thing back then
[22:20:38] <MootPoot> but overall system lag was, and still is
[22:21:00] <emmeka> MootPoot overall input lag in ye olde days was so minimal that lightguns worked
[22:21:28] <MootPoot> and it far overshadows whatever mouse you pick ( provided its a decent one ) 
[22:23:08] <MootPoot> I thought lightguns just didn't work anymore since they only  work with CRTs
[22:23:15] <theholyduck> well they mostly worked by being like almost directly tied into the cpu that was also directly tied into the thing driving the electron beam gun
[22:23:26] <theholyduck> pretty hard to accumulate much input lag that way
[22:23:31] <TsundereNoises> that's emmeka's whole point though?
[22:23:46] <emmeka> input lag was so minimal, so instantaneous, that you could reliably expect a trigger press on a lightgun to produce the effect on screen immediately, enough that it could then resend the signal and have another effect on screen from that and still not have detectable lag. We're talking fractions of ms
[22:24:02] <MootPoot> I guess but those systems couldn't really do anything aside from the one thing - gaming ASICS
[22:24:20] <theholyduck> i mean they could but not at the SAME time
[22:24:20] <theholyduck> :P
[22:24:29] <MootPoot> :3
[22:24:36] <theholyduck> no real multi-processing/mulit-tasking 
[22:25:01] <emmeka> then we entered the modern world and now consoles, PCs, displays, gamepads, mice, keyboards, bluetooth, network speeds, etc etc all introduce all sorts of lag
[22:25:20] <MootPoot> emmeka: pretty much just the system now
[22:25:33] <zoidberg> even our eyes have lag
[22:26:34] <MootPoot> This argument is basically like rolling up with a skateboard next to a car and sneering at it, going "heh, I bet you can't turn on a dime as fast as I can"
[22:26:43] <zoidberg> MootPoot: what games do you play?
[22:27:23] <MootPoot> completely ignoring that there are so many other things a car does, and its still worth paying attention to turning radius, even on a car rather then telling everyone to use a skateboard
[22:27:45] <emmeka> MootPoot your analogy isn't great, because in this case the skateboard moves lightyears faster than the car
[22:28:17] *** Quits: KatrinValerie (~KatrinVal@user/katrinvalerie) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[22:28:50] <MootPoot> but the car driver is doing things which are infinitely better then the skateboard, since the skateboard is simply not capable of doing them and scores a DNF

[22:50:01] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: along with emmeka
[22:50:33] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: well actually you are not
[22:50:35] <JenniFurr> That too TsundereNoises, but : too real cat faces with *human* shaped heads, it just doesn't look good at all
[22:50:58] <zoidberg> most of us are "well actually" people
[22:51:06] <zoidberg> I stopped doing them
[22:51:37] <JenniFurr> We anthro's notice these things
[22:51:38] <emmeka> zoidberg I kind of what to hit whoever wrote this with a stick
[22:51:43] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: yeah, my point is, several of us get laid despite that
[22:51:57] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: that's just an article to make lonely people feel better by giving them a justification to work on
[22:52:29] <zoidberg> I think he still lives in Mexico
[22:52:34] <emmeka> basically this person is kind of fumbling with the idea of mansplaining, but written in a way that makes it clear they don't know this term, and with the premise of "guys, GUYS. it turns out if you let girls talk, sometimes they give you sex!"
[22:52:53] <TsundereNoises> I mean, it's the same thing as fad diets or religion, you just play to what people are unhappy about and give them a concrete reason that they can work on
[22:52:56] <zoidberg> yeah, even the well actually people get laid
[22:52:59] <TsundereNoises> doesn't matter if it's real
[22:53:17] <JenniFurr> Testify emmeka!
[22:53:23] <zoidberg> but he's right about they not being popular
[22:53:38] <zoidberg> not for everyone
[22:53:57] <TsundereNoises> that's the thing, you can well actually people without being super condescending about it
[22:54:02] <TsundereNoises> I mean, solidfox still thinks I'm a dick
[22:54:06] <TsundereNoises> but not everyone does
[22:54:06] <TsundereNoises> !
[22:55:07] <TsundereNoises> JenniFurr: so you think Cats would have been better if it had been made by furries, for furries?
[22:55:08] <zoidberg> emmeka: actually amigojapan knows that person
[22:55:16] <emmeka> !findquote emmeka math problem
[22:55:16] <ImoutoBot> emmeka: (16 / 173) <e‚Äãmmeka> protip: conceiving of being with a woman as "what series of actions do I have to take to get into her pants" like they're a math problem and not a human being, is not a good way to go about things (nor a reliable way to actually get laid)
[22:55:25] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan, who has also had sex with people
[22:55:35] <zoidberg> emmeka: He met him in Mexico. That's gnome creator btw.
[22:55:47] <TsundereNoises> presumably, since he has a kid
[22:56:04] <JenniFurr> TsundereNoises, maybe, perhaps not, we'll never really know, will we?
[22:56:08] <zoidberg> you're doing it again TsundereNoises 
[22:56:12] <emmeka> zoidberg that doesn't surprise me
[22:56:25] <TsundereNoises> JenniFurr: I mean, by all accounts his kid isn't Jesus, but who knows
[22:56:31] <TsundereNoises> the kid IS half-mexican
[22:56:45] <JenniFurr> Re: cats
[22:57:02] <emmeka> zoidberg my point isn't so much that he's wrong, it's that he's approaching this without questioning the toxic and sexist ways and reasons of this behaviour.
[22:57:07] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: almost never played fighting games
[22:57:41] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: I got just enough into them to realize that there's a lot of strategy that appeals to me, and enough to realize that being good at them is way more effort than I can put in
[22:57:48] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: though one time I did, I figured out an easy trick that got me something like 15 wins compared to my friend's 4, he sold the console soon after
[22:57:58] <TsundereNoises> lol
[22:58:03] <zoidberg> alright emmeka, we will chat about this later
