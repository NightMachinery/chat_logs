[00:10:45] <olle> chunked_transfer_encoding off; was suggested
[00:12:02] <Sammitch> did the suggestion also say what that does and why it was suggested? can you even reliably reproduce the issue so you can tell if it actually fixed it?
[00:12:40] <olle> My colleague did
[00:12:46] <olle> Error log pointed to http 1.0 vs 1.1, he said
[00:14:35] <Sammitch> oh did some users just suddenly switch to an ancient, obsolete version of HTTP today?
[00:17:13] <olle> Seems like the other way, HTTP 1.0 works, 1.1 doesn't (he said)
[00:17:30] <olle> One installation works now, but not sure how to test reliably :d
[00:17:40] <olle> Guess I could remove the fix and test again
[00:19:49] <Sammitch> really this is just poking the raw nerve that is seeing someone flip random switches until the problem stops, and also being super bitchy today in general for no reason <_<

[01:01:36] *** Joins: Beryllium (sid186414@lymington.irccloud.com)
[01:01:55] <Sammitch> short answer: yes
[01:02:01] <olle> But I can copy them?
[01:02:03] <olle> 3 million files :|
[01:02:25] <__adrian> s/yes/no, but yes/
[01:02:49] <Sammitch> you can, but unless your disks are VERY fast that's going to take a WHILE
[01:03:00] <Sammitch> and chances are that most of those are dead sessions
[01:03:10] <Sammitch> and the live ones will invalidate themselves while you're copying
[01:03:24] <Sammitch> sounds like you have session gc issues
[01:03:34] <Sammitch> IMO just delete them all
[01:04:54] <olle> Sammitch: All session are from today when checking file date
[01:05:33] <olle> Sammitch: I can't delete them, because that would destroy peoples answers to surveys
[01:05:49] <olle> Or would it...
[01:05:49] <Sammitch> what on earth are you running?
[01:06:10] <olle> Legacy stuff :)
[01:06:13] *** Joins: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy)
[01:06:48] <olle> But no, answers are saved in database each time a participant goes to next page.
[01:06:49] <Sammitch> and you have 3m+ unique users in a single day?
[01:06:59] <olle> 4m, PHP cleaned 1M just now
[01:07:10] <olle> Big survey in Canada, it seems.
[01:07:10] * __adrian supposes the problem might be with session creation, rather than cleanup
[01:07:31] <Sammitch> also yes. session count != user count
[01:08:03] <Sammitch> I'm going to wager that the FS that your session store is on ran out of inodes, yes?
[01:08:13] <olle> Oooooh
[01:08:22] <olle> It's an Ubuntu system, nothing special
[01:08:45] <Sammitch> yeah no, indoes are the _opposite_ of special
[01:09:16] <olle> I mean, we didn't configure the file system anything
[01:09:23] <olle> No btrfs or such
[01:09:54] <Sammitch> still not relevant
[01:10:17] <Sammitch> are you trying to move the session dir because the disk keeps saying "I'm full!" but there's still space available?
[01:10:57] <olle> No, the disk *was* full
[01:11:09] <olle> At least that partition that /var/lib/php/session is on
[01:11:26] <olle> And then sessions got removed, I assume by PHP
[01:11:39] <__adrian> why would you assume this?
[01:13:32] <olle> What else would it be...?

[01:15:48] <olle> "Can't save session file, no memory, cleanup stuff"
[01:17:28] <Sammitch> did you look at the actual disk usage, or did you just trust that the error message meant what you think it did?
[01:19:13] <Sammitch> because there is a finite number of files that ytou can create on a partition that is set at the time you format it, otherwise known as "inode count", and once you run out the disk _acts_ like it's full
[01:19:33] <Sammitch> `df -i` will show you this usage
[01:19:51] <Sammitch> and is a wholly different and frequently ignored scaling factor
[01:21:03] <olle> Sammitch: I don't have access to our monitor system from home
[01:21:16] <olle> Sammitch: I used df a lot to track the usage
[01:21:18] <Sammitch> and even so, having 3 million session files for a single day is a powerful smell if you don't have a matching number of unique daily users
[01:21:33] <olle> Sammitch: No, it's not a smell, some surveys are really big
[01:21:52] <Sammitch> it doesn't matter how big the session is, having 3 million of them is the issue
[01:21:57] <__adrian> "some surveys are really big" is a smell that maybe you don't understand Sammitch's point above
[01:22:11] <olle> Big = reaches lots and lots of users
[01:22:23] <olle> Also, lots of session files are 11M, that is a smell, yes :)
[01:23:26] <olle> OK, didn't know about df -i, good tip
[01:23:36] <Sammitch> did literally 10% of the enitre population of canada visit your site today?
[01:24:06] <olle> I'd have to ask support, and they're sleeping, but we had some customer coming up with something...
[01:24:19] <olle> Some years ago we had a link in a French newspaper about daylight saving time
[01:25:00] <__adrian> only 3.3% of the US population. seems more plausible.
[01:26:34] <Sammitch> I got DDoSed once because a client's user banged a married reality TV star, but we're talking about YOUR site TODAY.
[01:27:09] <Sammitch> and if you're not interested in actually listening to the things we're saying I don't know why you're bothering to talk to us
[01:27:21] <olle> I'm trying, it's just a bit late here :)
[01:27:44] <olle> You think we got DOS?
[01:27:55] <__adrian> no, he was bringing up something irrelevant
[01:28:15] <__adrian> as daylight savings in france would seem to be
[01:28:56] <__adrian> personally, my bet is on session creation.
[01:29:24] <__adrian> if you legit have traffic like this, then you need to figure out scaling  :)
[01:30:34] <olle> It's rare. But yes, it's a good point, indeed.
[01:30:46] <olle> New guy already suggested redis for session
[01:31:00] <__adrian> that wouldn't solve anything
[01:32:49] *** Quits: bodiccea (~bodiccea@user/bodiccea) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[01:37:40] <olle> No?
[01:37:45] <olle> No better throughput?
[01:38:08] <__adrian> throughput? you ran out of disk space
[01:38:20] <__adrian> that's not a bandwidth problem
[01:38:38] <olle> If the issue is session creation tho?
[01:38:51] *** Quits: pmercado (~pmercado@186.107.35.198) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:39:22] <__adrian> but "switch to redis" just sounds like a baseless conclusion. you need to really figure out the problem first, and it doesn't sound like you have.
[01:40:10] <__adrian> no, if it's a session creation problem (i.e., creating too many sessions) then the solution would be to fix the sessions
[01:42:06] <__adrian> if you really do have so much traffic (that is, all 4m or whatever _really are_ unique-and-not-abandoned) then you need to figure out horizontal scaling. and sounds like you might be storing too much in your session, if 4m sessions ~> 14TB
[01:42:18] <Blondie101010> olle:  and if you think that calling an external service (like redis) is faster than reading a tiny file, then you should revise your IT knowledge as a whole
[01:42:21] <__adrian> (just using numbers i remember reading in the scrollback, ymmv)
[01:42:42] <Sammitch> for starters, if you can't fit your entire session store into memory redis is not going to help much
[01:43:21] <__adrian> mm. would go to disk anyways. though it might end up using fewer inodes.
[01:43:44] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d40f0d.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[01:44:04] <Blondie101010> that point would only be useful if RAM was cheaper than storage
[01:44:09] <Sammitch> stop trying to better accomodate the symptoms of the problem and fix the actual problem
[01:46:42] <olle> I guess redis would be part of horizontal scaling
[01:47:03] <Blondie101010> whatÉ
[01:47:08] <olle> No?
[01:47:11] <olle> No wait
[01:47:21] <olle> I'm thinking about centralized bla bla, but that's not needed
[01:47:24] <olle> I should go to bed...
[01:47:39] <__adrian> horizontal = spread out
[01:47:47] <Blondie101010> look at the junk you store in session files, and stop doing that
[01:47:49] <Blondie101010> that's it
[01:48:40] <Blondie101010> based on the size, I suspect you store result sets in it
[01:49:08] <Blondie101010> that is counter productive, and indicative of prior premature optimization
[01:49:20] <Sammitch> once you persist session data to a backend, eg: storing survey results, _remove them from the session_. maybe remove the entire session.
[01:49:37] <olle> We store sh*tloads of stuff in the session, yes. Known issue.
[01:49:44] <Blondie101010> so fix that
[01:49:48] <Blondie101010> nothing else to look at
[01:50:51] <Blondie101010> you're potentially duplicating your DB multiple times over that way
[01:51:54] <olle> Lots of different threads to pull in if we want to improve performance, caching being one. But yeah, so many users is rare... Will look into that tomorrow. :) Thanks for feedback, very nice!
[01:51:58] * olle zzz
[01:52:12] <Blondie101010> that is not caching
[01:52:19] <Blondie101010> caching is centralized
[01:53:10] <Blondie101010> that's a bad sluggish attempt to optimize something, but it can't work
[01:53:34] <Blondie101010> it might appear faster when you benchmark with a single user, but not with a real load

[10:07:06] <Naktibalda> Is it a bug or a feature that namespace doesn't match directory? https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/src/Framework/Exception/Error.php
[10:12:20] <AllenJB> Could be a feature - create package private classes by using require instead of autoloading
[10:14:25] <Naktibalda> definitelly a feature then
[10:18:01] <AllenJB> May also stop it appearing in autocomplete in IDEs, which might be a desired feature for a class called Error
[10:18:10] <Naktibalda> but it isn't used that way, probably a side effect of classmap autoloading

[11:51:29] <daedeloth> what would be a good way to cache objects that are required all over the f'ing project, without resorting to static variables?

[11:52:39] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[11:53:43] <daedeloth> perhaps a library with a singleton is slightly cleaner than a static method in the object itself
[11:55:59] <AllenJB> If you're using the Repository pattern (or similar) you could cache them at the Repository level - they're only actually retrieved the first time they're requested per script execution, then a (clone of the) cached instance is returned. The caching is invisible to the rest of the application.

[12:53:49] <kenoba> lol
[12:54:32] <kenoba> I guess I can see the point when you work on a shippable product that users can choose sqlite vs mysql postgres and such.... that might be handy

[12:55:09] <daedeloth> in reality switching between databases is always a bit troublesome :)
[12:55:29] <Naktibalda> you could try to use doctrine/dbal directly
[12:55:56] <kenoba> daedeloth agreed - however some products are build like that where backedns are selectable - like mautic or even wordpress
[12:56:02] <daedeloth> but i do see value in ORMs, less boilerplate, more readable code
[12:56:30] <TinoDidriksen> But it's not less boilerplate, though. It's the same boilerplate, and it's equally readable.
[12:56:48] <TinoDidriksen> Long ORM invocations will read like SQL, only less debuggable.

[12:58:40] <kenoba> lol
[12:58:48] <daedeloth> can't you get the parsed query somehow?
[12:59:19] <Naktibalda> I think that there is a ->getSql() method
[12:59:26] <TinoDidriksen> Even the query builder libraries - just why? It'll be more code than just writing out the query, and less debuggable again.
[13:00:19] <daedeloth> $bluePets = $store->pets()->where('color', '=', 'blue')->get();
[13:00:36] <daedeloth> i mean, that is clean.
[13:01:04] <daedeloth> true, there is a lot of black box going on
[13:01:34] <daedeloth> and you can easily generate millions of unnecessary queries
[13:01:50] <daedeloth> but if you know what is going on in the back, these are powerful tools
[13:01:57] <kenoba> daedeloth simple queries is where im kinda like yeah - ok - i guess thats simpler, but then if I have a dozen of databases - configuring entitity manager so many times maybe make it les worth it?
[13:03:04] <daedeloth> don't know about that, i hardly work on projects that require more than 2 databases
[13:07:21] <AllenJB> I just find it quicker and easier to write straight-up SQL rather than farting around trying to get something else to write the SQL I already know I want to write
[13:08:28] <daedeloth> well yea but ORM is more than just writing queries, once you have your results you still need to map them
[13:08:54] <kenoba> AllenJB any tips on dealing with whining coworkers that want orm though?
[13:09:26] <daedeloth> well make sure you have a repository layer so everyone can do whatever they want :P
[13:09:31] <AllenJB> Takes just as long to wire up an ORM as it does to write a simple hydrate method IMO
[13:09:34] <Naktibalda> when we get entities from ORM we map them to DTOs and then to models
[13:09:50] <daedeloth> hehe ok then that benefit is gone :P
[13:10:58] <kenoba> daedeloth repository layer? like $products->getAllByDate($date); and what happens in getAllByDate is either orm or raw sql?

[13:24:30] <PersonX> hello there, new to PHP, was in here a few days ago with some help regarding getting a mime-type. Curious if I can get some feedback on this class for handling uploading files (will handle errors better next, depending). Asking if this is "secure" or considered safe, or some helpful tips: https://pastebin.com/8wxJdCPG
[13:24:37] <fakuve> Hi peeps , what is the naming convention you use for creating `interfaces` `<ClassName>.interface` ? or `<ClassName>.contract` ?
[13:26:47] <Naktibalda> it is a bad practice to create an interface based on one class.
[13:28:50] <biberu> Naktibalda: that kinda depends on what it's for
[13:30:32] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[13:32:55] <Naktibalda> anyway, noone names their interfaces Contract
[13:34:26] <kenoba> PersonX mime type is manipulatable by the client - you cannot trust it at all
[13:35:31] <Blondie101010> what?
[13:35:41] <Naktibalda> kenoba: he doesn't trust mime type from $_FILES, but checks content
[13:36:10] <Blondie101010> ahh
[13:36:43] <kenoba> Naktibalda sure sure. one can embed php code into images: https://onestepcode.com/injecting-php-code-to-jpg/
[13:37:08] <kenoba> and then depending on ho good/bad your server is configured this may be an issue
[13:37:27] <Blondie101010> sure, and how stupid do you think they are to run a .jpg as a php script?
[13:37:40] <Blondie101010> they'd simply rename it or what?
[13:37:43] <kenoba> Blondie101010 people are pretty stupid
[13:38:04] <Blondie101010> so you check if it's a valid image, and then rename it to .php?
[13:38:08] <kenoba> Blondie101010 you can rename it sure - but php code will  still be there embedded
[13:38:14] <Blondie101010> that's not reasonable
[13:38:22] <Blondie101010> doesn't matter
[13:38:32] <Blondie101010> the image will be bad, but no one will run it
[13:38:50] <kenoba> it is possible your server is configured to pass jpegs to php interpeter - possible  .
[13:39:02] <kenoba> not sayign he's doing it  - but ive seen things happen
[13:39:12] <Blondie101010> only if you go out of your way to do it
[13:39:22] <Blondie101010> it can't even happen as a beginner mistake
[13:40:00] <kenoba> https://nealpoole.com/blog/2011/04/setting-up-php-fastcgi-and-nginx-dont-trust-the-tutorials-check-your-configuration/
[13:40:27] <PersonX> so if I check the mime via the actual $_FILE variable within the "upload_file" function, does that help with detecting valid mime type on top of what I have?
[13:40:48] <kenoba> there is plenty of folk copy-pasting ngingx configs without understanding, then there are those devs/ops teams working and not talking
[13:40:50] <fakuve> So I append .interface and thats it isnt it?
[13:41:29] <kenoba> PersonX id reencode the file - the only way to be sure
[13:41:47] <Naktibalda> fakuve: what exactly do you mean by .interface? can you show an example?

[13:46:05] <kenoba> Blondie101010 🤷‍♂️or make sure your  server configuration doesnt serve images as scripts... whichever
[13:46:47] <Blondie101010> definitely...  if you did that, you should turn off your computer and go spend the rest of your life in the jungle
[13:46:57] <kenoba> dont care either way friend

[13:52:46] <AllenJB> fakuve: It's not uncommon to add an Interface suffix to interface names - eg. 'DebtCollectorInterface'. But 'DebtCollector.interface' would not be a valid name ('.' is not allowed as part of a Class / Interface name)
[13:53:47] <fakuve> AllenJB: ok cheers
[13:55:48] <Blondie101010> AllenJB:  while true, and sometimes the easy way out, it does raise a small flag on the naming quality
[13:57:32] <Blondie101010> class Car extends Vehicle implements Motorized, Wheeled
[13:58:19] <AllenJB> True, but I wouldn't bet against the most common reason for doing it being because someone saw it used elsewhere, rather than actually considering context / reasoning
[14:01:21] <AllenJB> Naming things is not trivial and one of the Eternal Debates of programming =D
[14:01:30] <Blondie101010> for sure

[14:12:53] <biberu> PersonX: it could also return filenames that aren't valid for your file system, is not checking the input for errors (what if length is < 1 or > the length of your alphabet), and since you're only shuffling the alphabet you're removing a lot of possible names
[14:13:33] <biberu> PersonX: consider "abc", if you shuffle it you could get "abc", "bac", "cba" etc., but you could never get "aab", "ccb"
[14:15:53] <PersonX> That makes sense. Is there a suggestion you have that does not shuffle only the "string" I have, but come up with combinations you suggested? Blondie101010, yes I recall. I am still learning, but thank you for the reminder. I will be checking the db and fs, and also remembering to check for what biberu suggested
[14:17:40] <biberu> PersonX: a simple way could be bin2hex(random_bytes($len)), then keep asking for names in a loop until you get one that hasn't been used yet, once you do attempt to move the file (note that you could get a race there)
[14:18:54] <Blondie101010> with a generated string with 10 ** 52, the likelyhood of hitting a race condition is much lesser than winning the lottery twice in a row

[14:19:20] <Blondie101010> yep

[14:30:52] <Blondie101010> that's the very obvious part
[14:31:28] <fakuve> So basically all the ./src/app/Classname.php
[14:31:33] <fakuve> ok
[14:32:31] <fakuve> The directory as well `/App` I guess

[14:33:11] <Blondie101010> if App is in ./src, then you'd need another App level (not good)
[14:34:07] <fakuve> Why ? is it because psr-4 convention ?
[14:34:19] <Blondie101010> the way it works
[14:34:25] <Blondie101010> it has to point to the right place

[14:38:44] <Naktibalda> fakuve: in psr-4 autoload you don't need directory for the prefix

[15:39:00] <fakuve> ` Uncaught Error: Class "App\Invoice" not found `
[15:39:46] <dag> well it means incomplete understanding of autoloading probably. if you are using psr4 you can inspect vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php and verify if it looks okay
[15:41:01] <fakuve> I'm 'echo __NAMESPACE__ ;` at `./src/app/Invoice.php` and it says `App` (cause is placed right after the stament of `namespace App;` but I am not able to load the class from the other file `./src/public/index.php` as `$invoice = new App\Invoice();`

[15:41:34] <fakuve> I am yes

[18:28:42] <stenno> good attitude
[18:29:22] <fakuve> I am again with other exercise of the tutorials https://hastebin.com/fesoqeluku , when loading the class (line 80) It doesn't exists on the namespace

[18:30:12] <__adrian> just glancing, but shouldn't this be  "/src/app"  ?
[18:30:32] <__adrian> that mapping is   <namespace part>: <diretcory>
[18:30:37] <__adrian> *directory
[18:30:39] <fakuve> It may , of course you are used to this
[18:31:10] <fakuve> But for me is tricky . So first of all . The reason of being of autoload is basically load all the classes
[18:31:14] <__adrian> no
[18:31:15] <fakuve> Automatically
[18:31:20] <__adrian> the point is to load only the classes you're using

[18:31:33] <__adrian> yes
[18:31:46] <__adrian> that mapping is   <namespace part>: <directory>

[18:32:07] <__adrian> BUT are those class files in the src/ directory?
[18:32:13] <fakuve> and then I completely forget about whatever happens on there , cause autoload is working in the background
[18:32:29] <fakuve> they are
[18:32:35] <fakuve> they are in /src/app
[18:32:36] <__adrian> your directory diagram there says they're in  src/app
[18:32:51] <fakuve> well they are in a children of it
[18:32:56] <__adrian> you told composer that  "App" means "look in src".

[18:39:53] <__adrian> <if this part of the namespace matches>: <look for the rest of the name in this directory>
[18:39:53] <fakuve> But I still have a namespace defined in `/src/app/ClassName.php`
[18:40:21] <__adrian> yes, should be  namespace App;
[18:40:29] <__adrian> is it not?
[18:40:52] <fakuve> Within the ClassName.php , the namespace is App
[18:41:02] <Naktibalda> fakuve: I told you this hours ago:  App namespace matches src/ dir, so App\Invoice must be in src/Invoice.php
[18:41:09] <__adrian> does it look like this?  <?php namespace App; class CollectionAgency { ... }
[18:41:10] <fakuve> yeah , but then I reckon it get nested by autoload
[18:41:25] <__adrian> don't "recon" things. just read the instructions  :)
[18:41:31] <__adrian> *reckon
[18:41:37] <__adrian> does it look like this?  <?php namespace App; class CollectionAgency { ... }
[18:41:57] <fakuve> Ok
[18:42:01] <__adrian> and the file is /src/app/ClassName.php  ?
[18:42:15] <fakuve> Yes
[18:42:16] <__adrian> er,  /src/app/CollectionAgency.php  ?
[18:42:33] <__adrian> and your psr-4 says   "App\\": "src/app/"   ?
[18:42:39] <fakuve> Thatone not
[18:42:54] <fakuve> My psr-4 then is wrong I guess
[18:43:27] <__adrian> when you use a classname  \App\CollectionAgency , then  "App\\": "src/app/"  would tell composer to start with  src/app/
[18:43:36] <__adrian> it would then find CollectionAgency.php
[18:43:37] <fakuve> Do you guys have examples of repos using psr-4 autoload?
[18:43:48] <__adrian> github is full of them
[18:44:00] <fakuve> I need to know how to find them though
[18:44:20] <fakuve> let me check cause the other day I ended up in a library , and is not the same example
[18:44:24] <__adrian> tell me what you don't understand about the explanation above
[18:44:41] <__adrian> libraries define autoloading the same way
[18:44:44] <fakuve> Ok let me parse this
[18:46:21] <__adrian> e.g., https://github.com/php-enspired/exceptable/blob/master/composer.json#L28-L31
[18:46:53] <fakuve> Ok so the causality is . When executing this projects . 1) \App\CollectionAgency  , will get to autoload-psr4 , which will take it to the subdirectory of "App\\": "src/app/"
[18:47:02] <__adrian> yes
[18:47:06] <fakuve> 2nd) It would find the file
[18:47:11] <__adrian> yes
[18:47:30] <fakuve> But in my case as I have defined wrongly in composer.json "App\\": "src/" It doesnt find anything
[18:47:38] <__adrian> yes
[18:47:43] <fakuve> Ok one question
[18:47:56] <__adrian> (aside: do you actually want/need that subdirectory  app/  for some reason?)
[18:47:58] <fakuve> Why then define  again a namespace within the class ?
[18:48:18] <__adrian> if you don't declare the namespace for the file, it will not be namespaced.
[18:48:24] <fakuve> __adrian: (Im just copying the tutorial , so not really a reason to do things this way)
[18:48:43] <fakuve> ok so those are the 3 conditions
[18:48:48] <fakuve> To get something autoloaded
[18:49:07] <__adrian> as i said above, namespacing IS NOT a directory structure. people just often make them line up, for convenience.
[18:49:11] <Naktibalda> __adrian: earlier I found old php-fig discussion about interface name, and one argument against -able was that it can be difficult to comeup with such name, so PHP ended up using Throwable because Exceptionable is not a word.
[18:49:37] <__adrian> it's like thinking a URL is the same thing as a filesystem path. apache macthes them against each other, but they're NOT the same thing at all.
[18:49:51] <fakuve> ok
[18:49:52] <__adrian> Naktibalda: lol

[18:50:05] <fakuve> I'm gonna be fiddeling with this now
[18:50:23] <fakuve> What I don't understand now
[18:50:30] <Naktibalda> fakuve: you can use classmap autoloading and stop worrying about directory structure
[18:50:42] <__adrian> ^ you _can_
[18:50:44] <fakuve> (the only thing ) is how to set up autoload to be recursive
[18:50:46] <__adrian> but i wouldn't
[18:50:52] <__adrian> you DON'T.
[18:50:58] <__adrian> "recursive" is not desirable.
[18:51:01] <fakuve> Ok
[18:51:17] <__adrian> you absolutely don't want the autoloader to try to guess which file you want.
[18:51:30] <fakuve> So basically for each subdirectory you should instruct the `composer.json` to parse it in a different namespace
[18:51:37] <__adrian> you want to _know_ which file should be loaded, without question.
[18:51:42] <__adrian> ?
[18:52:05] <__adrian> no, like i said, most people line up their directory structure with their namespaces, for this reason.
[18:52:25] <Naktibalda> fakuve: usually all code of the single repository is in one top level namespace, so you can set it at /src
[18:52:26] *** Quits: deksar (~deksar@user/deksar) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[18:52:26] <__adrian> psr-4 uses the classname to map to a directory path.
[18:53:09] <__adrian> e.g., "App\\":"src/"  will let it find  App\A  at src/A.php  or  App\X\Y\Z at src/X/Y/Z.php
[18:53:11] <fakuve> meaning If I have say `./src/app/ClassInHere.php` ./src/otherDir/OtherClassHere.php` , then I would have to "App\\": "src/app/" "OtherDir\\" : "src/otherDir"
[18:53:21] <__adrian> yes

[19:58:33] <__adrian> (1)  namespace MyUser\MyProject\; ← no trailing \
[19:58:56] <__adrian> (2)  use MyUser\MyProject;  ← there's no point in using the namespace
[19:59:16] <__adrian> (3)  New MyClassOne;  ← this looks for \MyClassOne
[19:59:59] <__adrian> `use` makes an alias. so in order to do  New MyClassOne  you'd need to alias that classname (so we know about the namespace part).
[20:00:17] <__adrian> <?php  use MyUser\MyProject\MyClassOne; new MyClassOne();
[20:00:41] <fakuve> ahh
[20:01:04] <Naktibalda> alternatively you can do new MyProject\MyClassOne()  or use a fully quallified name   new \MyUser\MyProject\MyClassOne()
[20:01:24] <fakuve> So the alias cannot be used for the namespace it has to be done to an specific class (that kills the purpose of automating it)
[20:01:29] <__adrian> works, though i don't generally recommend either of those.
[20:01:38] <Naktibalda> you can't import all classes from namespace in PHP
[20:01:52] <__adrian> you _can_ alias a namespace (it doesn't work like you seem to expect)
[20:02:17] <fakuve> ok So let me amend this
[20:02:25] <__adrian> use MyUser\MyProject  ← makes an alias "MyProject" that resolves as "\MyUser\MyProject"

[21:38:35] <Hash> This message only shows up if I set the dev env to development.
[21:38:48] <Hash> Since it's a fatal error, shouldn't it show up reglardless of error reporting?
[21:39:04] <Hash> In code igniter, I don't see the message that a include file is missing in fatal php error/nginx error log
[21:39:15] <Hash> I only get this error in code igniter front end.
[21:39:32] <Hash> I had thought that if any dependency or require/include is missing, php will tell me.
[21:42:29] <__adrian> we have no idea what that const means or what decisions are based off of it. if it is indeed a `require` statement (not an `include` statement) then yes, it would error regardless of error reporting settings (though it may not be logged or displayed).
[21:42:49] <__adrian> more likely is that the value of that const causes the file to be required in one case and not the other.
[21:43:28] <__adrian> (e.g., similar to  if (ENVIRONMENT === 'development') { require "/var/www/social/application/third_party/rb.php"; }
[21:43:31] <__adrian> )

[22:49:52] <__adrian> but with objects, it's pointless

[22:49:58] <gordonfish> I see
[22:50:00] <Sammitch> references are not pointers, and objects are basically references anyways
[22:50:05] <__adrian> and with $this... i honestly didn't know it was ever valid
[22:50:06] <gordonfish> Thank you very much.
[22:50:07] <stenno> pointer-less
[22:50:59] <gordonfish> Sammitch: Yeah I would have figured an object instance would always be a reference
[22:52:14] <__adrian> conceptually, yes, it's a "reference"

[22:52:30] <__adrian> but in technical terms, "reference" doesn't mean the same thing in php as it does in other languages
[22:52:52] <__adrian> and with objects, it's not even a "reference" in php terms.

[23:24:41] <gordonfish> One more question if I may. I've encountered a couple instance where the original author used 'break' and 'continue' inside of fuctions sans any loops. Did they just return in some way in older PHPs ?

[23:26:08] <gordonfish> (Just looking at it I'm rather surprised that usage was ever a thing but looks like it something in older versions, but I cannot test as I do not have php5 or older to test with.)
[23:26:42] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/rlkHW   don't think that's ever been valid
[23:27:24] *** Joins: ReimuHakurei (~Reimu@216.126.195.252)
[23:27:31] <gordonfish> Well it was in a code base that used to run just fine in php5
[23:27:43] <__adrian> as you can see, it wasn't valid in php 5
[23:28:03] <gordonfish> Curious
[23:28:05] <__adrian> either it was never _actually_ run  ;)  or it's not how i understood you
[23:28:53] <AllenJB> The only case I can think of that break / continue applies to "without loops" is `switch`
[23:30:19] <gordonfish> AllenJB: break I can understand, but what would continue do in a switch?
[23:30:44] <gordonfish> (Assuming PHP switches drop through by default like in C/C++)
[23:31:01] <AllenJB> gordonfish: It behaves the same as break. PHP considers `switch` a looping structure: https://www.php.net/continue
[23:31:02] <__adrian> https://php.net/control-structures.continue
[23:31:08] *** Joins: AsenMx (~AsenMx@78.90.248.234)
[23:31:41] <__adrian> ^ a switch is a loop with only one iteration, so it's the same as a `break` (except dumb)
[23:32:09] <gordonfish> In the code I'm looking at, there's a fuction and some if/else statements, no loops or switch statements. They just put break and continue in certain if blocks
[23:32:30] <__adrian> if you want to share a specific example, there's probably an answer
[23:32:56] <gordonfish> __adrian: Wait, what? I would assume, if anything, continue would fall thru to the next case
[23:33:12] <gordonfish> (continue is usually the opposite of break)
[23:33:44] <__adrian> yeah, each `case` is not an iteration. the whole `switch` is an iteration. therefore, `continue`ing to the "next iteration" finishes the loop
[23:34:01] <biberu> wouldn't continue with an argument for an outer loop repeat that one? (so different from break in that case)
[23:34:30] *** Joins: deksar (~deksar@user/deksar)
[23:34:33] <__adrian> it's like  foreach (["one item"] as $item) { continue; }  // loop is over
[23:34:34] <gordonfish> __adrian: ah
[23:36:13] <__adrian> biberu: that sounds rather contrived  :p  iiuyc, no, it would "continue" (end) the switch and you'd still be in the same iteration of the outer loop
[23:36:20] <__adrian> unless you `continue 2`
[23:36:34] <__adrian> but really, just don't `continue` from a switch. it's dumb.
[23:36:38] <biberu> yeah, i mean e.g. continue 2
[23:38:19] <biberu> I feel like I'd have so many opinions about that in a PR ^^
[23:39:00] <__adrian> i would not discuss it to the lengths i've gone to here
[23:41:31] <biberu> the next day you'd simply have an opening on the team? ^^
[23:42:14] <__adrian> might depend on the employee and my expectations of them
