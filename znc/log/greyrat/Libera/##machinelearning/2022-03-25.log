[00:12:26] <FeedBot> [13Google:Research] A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks: Neural networks have been adapted to leverage the structure and properties of graphs. We explore the components needed for building a graph neural network - and motivate the design choices behind them. → https://bit.ly/3IwonyE
[00:12:30] <FeedBot> [13Google:Research] SPoT: Better Frozen Model Adaptation through Soft Prompt Transfer: There has been growing interest in parameter-efficient methods to apply pre-trained language models to downstream tasks. Building on the Prompt Tuning approach of Lester et al. (2021), which learns task-specific soft prompts to condition a frozen pre-trained model to perform different tasks, we propose a novel [...] → https://bit.ly/36FHh90
