[09:03:22] <pj> There is one main reason why I would still offer POP3 on a server, and that is solely to support gmail's feature where it can fetch mail from other servers which works with POP3 but not IMAP.
[09:04:58] <pj> I have no idea why Google didn't make that feature capable of working with IMAP.
[09:14:08] <thumbs> ok, I agree with you on that one

[15:41:43] <louis-lau> thumbs: Wanting your email to be local on a single device instead of being server based isn't a good reason? It's not something I personally want, but imo it's a "valid" reason.

[16:09:02] <rob0> louis-lau, not really.  IMAP clients can be set to pull and delete just like POP3 clients usually do.  And then you don't have that silly single inbox limitation, you can do server-side sorting into folders.
[16:09:41] <rob0> BranchPredictor: sorry.  You can place me on /ignore.
[16:11:40] <louis-lau> Oh really? I've never come across that setting. I suppose I didn't look for it though haha. Thanks! :)
[16:22:14] <rob0> well, it might vary by client, but there is nothing inherent in the protocol about leaving mail on the server.
