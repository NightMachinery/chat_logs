[00:04:42] <gwozniak> The LDR instruction (on v7-M) is how you load a word into a register.  (There are other ways, but this is the most obvious and direct.)  It uses a base register + offset addrssing.  The smallest way to get a value into a register is to do a PC-relative load, which has the limitations noted above
[00:06:08] <gwozniak> So it's going to be 6 or 8 bytes total, typically 6.  The vast majority of the time you can share a constant in a function and always use a 2-byte LDR

[00:12:25] <indigo> Gotcha. Thanks for the explanation! :)
[00:16:12] <gwozniak> indigo: I'm looking at ways to automate the dirty tricks, like when the top half of an address is all 0s, you can use a MOV to get the address into the register
[00:16:51] <gwozniak> similar (but different instruction) when the bottom half is all 0s
[00:18:34] <indigo> Interesting
[00:19:19] <gwozniak> These are total hacks, but they can save some bytes in the end
[00:19:47] <gwozniak> And frankly, reducing code size is mostly "success by a thousand cuts"

[03:31:33] <buttsbot> What's cooking on SourceHut? October 2021
[03:31:38] <companion_cube> that might help a bit with IRC I think
[03:31:48] <companion_cube> having not just a webclient, but also a bouncer?
[03:35:54] <indigo> That's cool; kinda like a hardcore irccloud
[03:40:06] <imode> are they just using thelounge or something.
[03:40:37] <imode> oh soju.
[03:40:49] <imode> and gamja... okay.
[03:40:55] <imode> meh.
[03:41:30] <indigo> I think there is space for a bouncer that isn't as complicated as ZNC
[03:41:35] <indigo> And written in a memory-safe language to boot
[03:42:33] <imode> I think there's space for something that isn't IRC, but that's just me.
[03:42:50] <companion_cube> that's matrix, and it's a lot more complicated
[03:42:57] <imode> that certainly is not matrix lmao.
[03:43:05] <companion_cube> a one-stop webchat + bouncer could be useful to a lot of noobs
[03:43:12] <companion_cube> or people who are kind of afraid of IRC in the first place
[03:43:34] <imode> clients are so fragmented, networks are so fragmented, the conversational model is so fragmented.. yeah, that's why people use discord et. al.
[03:43:46] <imode> just.. make next(IRC).
[03:45:39] <companion_cube> IRC and matrix are the only non proprietary chats at this time
[03:45:44] <companion_cube> if you don't care, discord is probably better
[03:46:01] <companion_cube> (if you're not worried about them fucking you in a few years for profits, that is)
[03:46:16] <companion_cube> if you do care, there's not much better than IRC
[03:46:18] <imode> having used all 3.. I don't like matrix, discord is.. discord, and I want off that wild ride, but IRC is comfy because my setup is comfy.
[03:46:25] <prussian> My plugin segfaults znc on unload sometimes and I'm assuming it has something to do with pthreads but have no desire to debug itm
[03:46:41] <prussian> So a memory safe bouncer probably would be nice.
[03:55:25] <companion_cube> sure, IRC is comfy when you're used to it
[03:55:30] <companion_cube> but a nice webchat can go a long way I think
[03:55:42] <companion_cube> currently webchats are mostly ok only if you use them sporadically
[03:59:51] <imode> I use Discord every day, it's alright.
[04:03:35] <companion_cube> I have a tab opened but I'd hate to rely on it for a group I value
[04:03:42] <companion_cube> it's just… ugh
[04:04:06] <companion_cube> with IRC it's easier to keep logs, write bots, and the TUI clients are just excellent

[07:57:33] <indigo> Shit happens
[07:58:10] <indigo> After I heard all that fun assembly talk from gwozniak, I was looking into C64 emulators and writing assembly for 6502
[07:58:22] <imode> ooooh that's how I cut my teeth.
[07:58:41] <imode> first program I wrote moved a small tile of mario's head around a screen on the NES.
[08:00:16] <imode> thaaaat was 12 years ago.. man.
[08:00:56] <defect> 12 years ago you were coding for the NES?
[08:01:03] <imode> yep!
[08:01:10] <imode> nesdev was a useful resource.
[08:01:13] <imode> I was 13.
[08:01:36] <indigo> Apparently there is something called CBM prg studio, which hooks directly into the VICE emulator so you can use a more modern editor rather than typing everything on the C64
[08:01:39] <defect> how on earth did you end up doing NES stuff
[08:02:11] <imode> I was in 8th grade, I played old NES games on the bus, I got curious about FCEUX's debug menu, now I work for Amazon writing services that handle 350m transactions per day.
[08:02:26] <defect> fair enough
[08:02:38] <imode> the transitions in between are weirder.
[08:02:42] <imode> but that's essentially how I started.
[08:03:05] <defect> my first programming experience was writing bitchin away scripts in mircs scripting language
[08:03:12] <imode> I joined the #nesdev crowd in 2009 and also got into digital logic design. built my first CPU at roughly the same time I learned about assembly.
[08:03:23] <imode> then came verilog. then C!
[08:03:48] <imode> I remember buying my first Altera FPGA board. a DE1.
[08:04:05] <indigo> Nice
[08:06:15] <defect> yeah, that's a cool path into the whole thing
[08:09:16] <defect> 13 year old me was not that resourceful. i think counter-strike was the focus
[08:09:58] <imode> I didn't have much of a social life, and I flunked a bunch of stuff in highschool.
[08:10:15] <imode> I still think it was worth it.
[08:10:25] <defect> yeah, turned out all right?
[08:10:36] <imode> so far!
[08:10:58] <defect> anything you would change in hindsight?
[08:11:12] <defect> sorry, late friday night and i'm getting philosophical
[08:11:49] <imode> probably not try to chomp off more than I could chew in 2015.
[08:11:58] <imode> probably actually get my associates.
[08:12:41] <imode> maybe pursue my educational passions a little more. find a good therapist when I was 20.
[08:15:39] <companion_cube> shit, imode, you're only 25?
[08:15:45] <imode> mhm.
[08:15:48] <defect> yeah, i didn't quite finish my uni education and it kinda bugs me a bit
[08:16:10] <imode> fwiw I don't think it's worth it.
[08:17:00] <defect> no, i wouldn't have a better job if i finished my degree
[08:17:07] <defect> just a personal thing
[08:17:18] <imode> yeah.. I'm in the same boat.
[08:17:44] <imode> I was teaching the courses I was paying to take during my second semester. was made honorary faculty. it was fulfilling work. beyond fulfilling, actually.
[08:18:25] <imode> fell down a flight of stairs in 2015, defense contractor offered me good money.
[08:18:43] <imode> not a day goes by that I don't regret turning down that offer.
[08:19:06] <imode> there are few times in your life where you know you've made a mistake, and that was one of them for me. it was a distinct cut in my timeline as an individual.
[08:19:21] <imode> where I chose something that was financially motivating instead of ethically and borderline spiritually motivating.
[08:19:33] <imode> I contemplate that moment every time I go to sleep.
[08:20:04] <companion_cube> wait, did you take the job?
[08:20:08] <imode> I did.
[08:20:11] <defect> are you stuck at this defense contractor somehow?
[08:20:22] <companion_cube> you don't regret not turning it down then?
[08:20:27] <companion_cube> ugh
[08:20:28] <imode> yeah.. double negatives are hard.
[08:20:32] <defect> hah
[08:20:33] <imode> triple or quadruple even moreso.
[08:20:34] <companion_cube> quadruple here
[08:20:39] <companion_cube> :D
[08:20:51] <defect> i spent a good minute trying to decipher it
[08:20:58] <imode> I worked there six months, moved out west.
[08:21:11] <imode> life's different out here. you can't build a community of people in washington.
[08:21:26] <imode> the moment I took the offer is the moment that my support network started to decay.
[08:21:27] <defect> seattle seems nice_
[08:21:28] <defect> ?
[08:21:30] <imode> it isn't.
[08:21:43] <imode> I had friends back home. I don't have anybody here.
[08:21:50] <imode> it's just myself, my wife and my parents.
[08:22:10] <companion_cube> so you're 25, and married? heh
[08:22:34] <defect> brb
[08:22:36] <imode> met her 10 years ago. re-met 7 years ago.
[08:22:52] <imode> love doesn't fade.
[08:23:19] <companion_cube> sounds like a lovely story :)
[08:23:34] <imode> tragic, but lovely. she was homeless most of her life.
[08:23:48] <imode> scoliosis, a host of genetic disabilities.
[08:24:05] <imode> will never work a day in her life. loves arts and crafts and writing.
[08:24:19] <imode> I put a bubble around her. she deserves it.
[08:24:37] <imode> feels like I'm rambling, sorry.
[08:24:44] <companion_cube> I don't think you are
[08:24:54] <companion_cube> family is an important matter
[08:25:22] <defect> all good. how's amazon? from the outside all you hear is the bad stuff
[08:25:36] <imode> oh it's a tragic dumpster fire full of underfunded and understaffed projects.
[08:25:46] <companion_cube> underfunded? damn
[08:25:56] <imode> where a single mouse click can bring down production and nobody gives a shit about downstream.
[08:26:13] <companion_cube> the error is having mice in the first place
[08:26:19] <companion_cube> (jk, I use one too)
[08:26:20] <defect> so it is what we hear
[08:26:22] <imode> you joke but that's the attitude of the engineers.
[08:26:29] <imode> some of them, anyway. I do work with good people.
[08:27:18] <imode> I'm in an org that doesn't really have a lot of chaos involved. we're non-critical. we're digital accounting.
[08:27:36] <imode> a corner of amazon where we don't really care so long as the data gets to us and we persist it in some form some how some where some way.
[08:27:51] <imode> it's not a glamorous job. but it is a secure one: nobody wants to do this work.
[08:28:37] <imode> next week starts a two-week on-call rotation for me. we take roughly 500 requests in a given month via a Slack workflow, and we have 4 30-minute office hours sessions per day. each request is independent of the other: debugging and addressing each requires hours of work.
[08:29:15] <imode> navigating complex accounting requirements and absorbing ambient business knowledge from subject matter experts is the majority of our time, along with the prime directive: protect the platform.
[08:29:26] <companion_cube> so you're like an archivist?
[08:30:04] <defect> i'm oncall right now and 500 requests per month sounds awful
[08:30:10] <imode> that's a low figure.
[08:30:29] <imode> every transaction for a digital asset within Amazon takes a trip through our systems, and our systems are configured with roughly 100+ teams touching every inch of 50+ code packages.
[08:31:07] <imode> we essentially make the connection between upstream digital ordering systems, subscription management/lifecycle systems, IAP bridges within Amazon and other companies, royalty calculation engines, and like 50+ other sources.
[08:31:28] <defect> so, are we talking accounting for aws as well as the amazon shops?
[08:31:28] <imode> we allow you to take in events from those systems, parse them, and chomp them up into what amounts to ledger entries in an accounting ledger.
[08:31:33] <imode> yes.
[08:31:36] <companion_cube> I understood some of these words
[08:31:36] <defect> fuck me
[08:31:52] <imode> audible, prime video, twitch.
[08:32:05] <imode> amazon luna was a new one.
[08:32:11] <companion_cube> you must have some interesting opinions about the twitch leak then :)
[08:32:20] <imode> we had an internal dialogue about it which amounted to "lol".
[08:32:41] <imode> basically not our problem. financials weren't from us.
[08:33:41] <imode> it's not high-risk work, but we maintain the thing that consumes just about every single transaction that's in the digital space in areas that Amazon is active in.
[08:33:45] <imode> fire TV, that shit.
[08:34:00] <imode> so many customers with very, very specific accounting requirements.
[08:34:08] <imode> if something goes _wrong_, we have to debug everything from first principles.
[08:34:24] <defect> well, i mean, if your pipeline stops revenue stops, no?
[08:34:30] <imode> correct.
[08:34:41] <defect> so, some risk :)
[08:34:43] <imode> I'm currently designing an expert system that wraps around every single service and collects facts to do some basic logical reasoning as to "where this thing went and what happened to it".
[08:35:00] <imode> the transactions are present in some data source somewhere. we just need to kick them down the pipeline.
[08:35:06] <defect> right
[08:35:08] <imode> bookings do stop, therefore accounting gets huge variances.
[08:35:16] <imode> the largest bleed I fixed was a $400m.
[08:35:19] <imode> that was ufn.
[08:35:21] <imode> *fun.
[08:35:44] <indigo> All about that stakeholder alignment eh imode
[08:35:53] <imode> I'd love to watch it all burn.
[08:35:55] <defect> i work in ads serving at fb (yeah, i know)
[08:36:03] <imode> ah, so you've sold your soul as well.
[08:36:09] <defect> always fun to realize the loss of an outage
[08:36:10] <defect> yep
[08:36:36] <imode> I can't imagine what you were thinking during that outage.
[08:36:52] *** Joins: gco (~gco@2601:647:5a00:524:79be:fb8a:d4f4:907e)
[08:37:16] <indigo> Hey, we almost have a full FAANG here, just need an Apple and Netflix (I’m at G)
[08:37:16] <defect> couldn't do much to be honest. we set up a plan to get our services back when the networks came back
[08:37:45] <imode> interesting question, actually: how often do developer-critical services go down?
[08:37:57] <imode> outside of public-facing network outages.
[08:38:16] <imode> indigo: hire me please. I make $150k/yr TC and I used to be a senior engineer.
[08:38:22] <companion_cube> well sometimes stack overflow shuts down
[08:38:38] <imode> companion_cube: our build tools go down regularly. hell our pipelines go down regularly.
[08:38:40] <companion_cube> wow, amazon is cheap
[08:38:49] <indigo> In the bay??
[08:38:49] <imode> yes, they are. heavy on equity.
[08:38:53] <imode> no, washington.
[08:38:55] <imode> northwest.
[08:38:56] <defect> not that often tbh. i do all my work on a remote devbox and the last year maybe twice i haven't been able to connect
[08:39:17] <imode> imagine if the core auth service just died for eight hours.
[08:39:37] *** Quits: gco (~gco@2601:647:5a00:524:79be:fb8a:d4f4:907e) (Client Quit)
[08:39:49] <defect> kinda what happened last monday
[08:39:57] <imode> happens every other month here.
[08:40:00] <defect> heh
[08:40:25] <imode> I remember last year a sev 1 (business-critical function is down) was posted for a giant warehouse fire.
[08:40:29] <imode> that was fun to watch the event stream for.
[08:41:12] <defect> i do enjoy following along big outages if i can
[08:41:28] <imode> if you ask me if I enjoy my work, I'd say I'd want to claw bezos' eyes out and burn the entire concept of Amazon to the floor.
[08:41:50] <imode> someone has my ethics and morals locked in a box somewhere.
[08:43:21] <defect> it's hard though. what else are you gonna do? stepping away from a FAANG salary is tough
[08:43:39] <defect> i admit it, i am a weak human
[08:43:48] <imode> I have a family to support.
[08:44:10] <imode> there is nothing I can do except for engineer another primary income source.
[08:44:26] <imode> which, I have plans for.
[08:47:21] <companion_cube> making your own company or sth like that? :)
[08:47:26] <imode> yup.
[08:48:17] <defect> that'd be amazing. but i'im too risk averse for something like that
[08:48:41] <companion_cube> doing one's company is also a shit ton of work
[08:49:02] <imode> the stuff you see me posting about FV3 is kind of the basis to the whole idea. I don't know if I'll finish it, but you need to prove that it can work before you build the infrastructure around making it profitable.
[08:50:39] <companion_cube> Hmm
[08:50:52] <imode> the hardest part has been finding a language that you can actually sandbox. and by that I mean, _actually sandbox_.
[08:50:59] <companion_cube> Businesses around programming languages are hard, if you're thinking about that
[08:51:18] <imode> if discord is the facebook of chat, I am the myspace of chat.
[08:52:04] <imode> that's been the easiest way I explain it without showing people mocks.
[08:56:42] <imode> server-side interpreter sending draw/control commands to a client, "servers" organized into rooms that are attached to these interpreters, each interpreter is persistent and can handle new connections, code that the interpreter runs is organized into "apps". you're playing chess in one room while your friends are playing a zelda-like dungeon crawler in another. others are chatting in a
[08:56:44] <imode> straightforward text chat.
[09:00:17] <imode> you need the "safe" programming language before you can do this properly. and I don't mean one that you can limit the execution time of: you need one who's interpreter state is able to be stepped on known boundaries, that isn't that "smart" in terms of JIT optimization so you can still restrict it/step it on obivous boundaries...
[09:00:45] <imode> if things crash, you want to be able to spin them right up again.
[09:00:51] <imode> right where they left off.
[09:00:59] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[09:02:53] <imode> LambdaMOO is a pretty big inspiration: in an era without multithreading, they managed to have very reasonable performance with a purely interpreted virtual machine handling everything from new connections to accounts to in-depth game logic. in the 90's.
[09:05:41] <dimadima> imode have you considered the actor model
[09:05:49] <dimadima> :) :) :)
[09:06:13] <imode> shared-nothing is admirable. an older language of mine explored a minified version of erlang.
[09:06:30] <dimadima> i was just kidding more or less
[09:06:52] <dimadima> just saying something boring after all your exotic stuff
[09:07:08] <imode> yeah.. I guess that is all exotic lol.
[09:07:22] <dimadima> to me
[09:07:24] <imode> sometimes I wish I was boring. stuff like the above kills chats. I wish I could enjoy typescript.
[09:07:33] <imode> or whatever the node ecosystem is these days.
[09:07:34] <dimadima> i'm like, a normie, if you will, when it comes to computer programming
[09:07:48] <imode> meh. that's just a scope problem. you can get into weird shit.
[09:08:54] <companion_cube> Have you looked at sand storm?
[09:08:55] <dimadima> got to do what you enjoy
[09:09:02] <dimadima> or try to, anyway
[09:09:04] <imode> companion_cube: wazzat.
[09:09:05] <companion_cube> (i think that was the name)
[09:09:13] <companion_cube> The thing built on capnproto
[09:09:33] <imode> ohhhh I've seen this before...
[09:09:36] <companion_cube> https://sandstorm.io/
[09:09:37] <buttsbot> Sandstorm
[09:09:47] <companion_cube> Capabilities everywhere
[09:09:59] <imode> mao.
[09:10:01] <imode> *lmao.
[09:10:11] <companion_cube> Anyway, good night
[09:10:15] <imode> cheers. o/
[09:10:25] <defect> gnight companion_cube
[09:11:01] <imode> that's an admirable initiative, self-hosting web apps easier.
[09:11:11] <imode> that's a never-ending game of catch-up though.
[09:11:14] <defect> dimadima: don't worry too much about it. writing boring code pays a lot of bills too
[09:11:47] <imode> something stupid changes and you have to update how everything is done.
[09:11:55] <imode> ...like bobcat recently.
[09:12:09] <imode> maxRequestQueueDepth went from 10k to 0.
[09:12:18] <imode> who the fuck thought _that_ was a good idea.
[09:13:03] <dimadima> oh i'm not worried. that's the beauty of this world. everyone gets to do what they like given the resources they have
[09:13:39] <dimadima> or something
[09:13:42] <defect> :thumbsup:
[09:13:43] <dimadima> i didn't really articulate that well
[09:13:48] <defect> shit this isn't slack
[09:14:02] <dimadima> 👍
[09:14:03] <imode> it can be. thelounge.chat
[09:14:21] <imode> also fwiw the exotic stuff isn't that useful _unless_ you want to some fundamental shit.
[09:14:59] <imode> "getting stuff done" technology is inherently more useful, and it takes a long time and some wear 'n tear to get to that level for a project.
[09:15:12] <defect> imode and i have sold our souls. what do you do dimadima?
[09:15:19] <defect> if you don't mind me asking
[09:15:29] <dimadima> i really didn't mean that in any, uh, derrogatory or pejorative way or something
[09:15:48] <dimadima> lol defect i'm trying to sell my soul
[09:16:04] <dimadima> in fact, i'm running twitter ads right now, and was wondering whether you have any thoughts on FB ads
[09:16:21] <imode> rent your soul instead. much less paperwork.
[09:16:53] <defect> i really don't, i'm sorry. all i can say is that the FB ads stack is insane
[09:17:06] <imode> do tell!
[09:17:12] <dimadima> in other words, i'm working on a startup. honestly a bit reluctant to drop it here any more cause i've been doing that a bunch lately
[09:17:29] <imode> I think your product is ethical fwiw.
[09:17:47] <dimadima> that's the goal
[09:17:53] <imode> whether it fills a niche is the next step you'll have to take. ;)
[09:18:00] <dimadima> but i'm going to be aggressive in trying to make sure it doesn't fail
[09:18:24] *** Joins: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz)
[09:18:26] <dimadima> we'll see! i just got some ppl from NZ sign up
[09:18:33] <imode> nice!!
[09:18:53] <dimadima> as it, from logs, it looks like someone came from twitter ads and then told some friends
[09:18:58] <dimadima> as in*
[09:19:33] <defect> dimadima: i have $250 per month of fb ad credits to spend
[09:19:52] <imode> what would you even use that on.
[09:20:00] <dimadima> wish i had more money to drop on twitter ads cause certain markets are sooo expensive
[09:20:05] <dimadima> hey defect i'll take it!
[09:20:07] <dimadima> lol
[09:20:11] <dimadima> imode: advertise?
[09:20:23] <dimadima> i'll probably spend like $2000 after that
[09:20:29] <imode> damn.
[09:20:38] <dimadima> (cause that's how that shit goes)
[09:20:51] <dimadima> advertising is lazy though, right? i'm not stoked for my future in "content marketing" etc
[09:21:00] <dimadima> and audience building
[09:21:17] <imode> I dunno. I'm a firm believer that you don't need to advertise a product if it's good, in the same way that you don't need filler if you want to guarantee product quality.
[09:21:20] <dimadima> a person popped into my discord last night and told me i need to have an "announcements" channel
[09:21:31] <imode> word of mouth is more powerful than ad campaigns.
[09:21:38] <imode> so is dogfooding.
[09:21:46] <defect> imode: yeah, in a perfect setting
[09:22:03] <imode> yeah..
[09:22:05] <dimadima> yeah that's why i'm stoked about this potentially word-of-mouth thing. i've had a couple of those and it's been rewarding
[09:22:24] <dimadima> for example: https://twitter.com/Mat_Hmm/status/1449031069546827780
[09:22:24] <buttsbot> Twitter - Mat_Hmm - @jzfski Dzięki za info, wypróbuję sobie, widzę, że na androida jest
[09:22:29] <imode> https://geneva.com/ <-- I built this.
[09:22:30] <buttsbot> Geneva | This is where your group chats
[09:22:31] <dimadima> that was awesome
[09:22:59] <imode> built the whole backend and did some of the initial marketing.
[09:23:19] <dimadima> but you're not doing it now?
[09:23:24] <imode> nah I left, fuck those guys.
[09:23:46] <dimadima> yeah why does that always happen
[09:24:03] <imode> head of engineering gaslit and abused people.
[09:24:22] <dimadima> classic shit
[09:24:54] <dimadima> it's pretty though
[09:25:05] <imode> nothing can take that backend down.
[09:25:19] <imode> spread across AWS, GCP and Azure, along with colocated infra in several datacenters.
[09:25:19] <dimadima> what's it written in
[09:25:27] <dimadima> this was before amazon?
[09:25:27] <imode> golang and make.
[09:25:29] <imode> correct.
[09:25:33] <imode> I built it in 3 months.
[09:25:48] <dimadima> hah. my shit is believe-it-or-not year fucking 5
[09:26:00] <dimadima> finalllllly happening
[09:26:10] <imode> hey, my shit's year 1. working out your shit takes time.
[09:26:13] <dimadima> i'm definitely a lot less prepernaturally tech gifted than most people
[09:26:20] <dimadima> had to learn a lot
[09:26:23] <dimadima> made so many mistakes lol
[09:26:30] <dimadima> tried building an app with fucking event sourcing
[09:26:32] <dimadima> who the fuck does that
[09:26:36] <dimadima> whhhhhyyyyyyyy
[09:26:40] <imode> lmao, I had a dude who was a giant fan of that.
[09:26:53] <dimadima> that's fucking dumb
[09:27:05] <dimadima> anyway, learned java, learned a lot of shit
[09:27:37] <dimadima> what do you mean your shit is year 1
[09:27:48] <dimadima> FV3?
[09:27:48] <imode> as in I've been working on it for a year.
[09:27:51] <imode> yup.
[09:27:56] <dimadima> part time though
[09:27:56] <imode> there's a reason there's a 3 at the end of that.
[09:28:09] <dimadima> what's that reason
[09:28:12] <imode> went through two other revisions. the language is called feather.
[09:28:13] <dimadima> v3?
[09:28:17] <dimadima> i see
[09:28:54] <dimadima> im like 0 embarassed or ashamed or what have you; it's funny that something so superficially simple can take so long
[09:29:11] <dimadima> i had to "learn" figma the other week
[09:29:21] <dimadima> i couldn't believe i had to learn some shit
[09:29:21] <imode> teaching yourself how to engineer something from scratch is like, the hardest thing in the world.
[09:29:51] <imode> figma is some bullshit lmao.
[09:30:06] <dimadima> it's great if before you were working with photoship
[09:30:13] <imode> yeah...
[09:30:16] <dimadima> and you just need to, like, make some fucking graphics
[09:30:26] <dimadima> for 2 different app stores and a bunch of other shits
[09:30:41] <dimadima> they have components and instances
[09:30:48] <dimadima> i found it highly worthwhile
[09:31:17] <imode> if it's a tool that you use to push your business forward, I'd say it's worthwhile.
[09:31:40] <imode> do you have an idea of how to make money from it?
[09:31:49] <dimadima> yeah i have some ideas
[09:32:30] <imode> side note, whiskey and apple cider tastes like apple pie.
[09:32:33] <dimadima> the core of the app is periodicity; so everything flows from that
[09:32:40] <dimadima> hah it sure does
[09:32:47] <dimadima> that spice
[09:33:41] <imode> I admire your ability to deal with scope creep.
[09:33:53] <dimadima> so the revenue concepts are: newsletters (compete with substack, et al); circulars (periodic advertising); and public correpondences (ie clubhouse, but written)
[09:34:02] <dimadima> imode: mine?
[09:34:05] <imode> yup.
[09:34:19] <dimadima> what gives you the impression i've dealth with scope creep
[09:34:41] <imode> just that it's possible to go every which way with that idea of periodicity and you're going at it at a very pragmatic way.
[09:35:00] <dimadima> i'm not sure i understand
[09:35:06] <dimadima> if you would humor me with an explanation
[09:35:27] <dimadima> i would love to have dealt with scope creep, just not sure i have
[09:36:03] <dimadima> if i had a nickel for every person who just told me to build an MPV
[09:36:06] <dimadima> MVP*
[09:36:22] <imode> you have a restrictive idea, which is the idea of periodic messaging. you could do a lot of interesting things with that, up to and including things like automated play-by-mail games.
[09:36:35] <dimadima> oh well shit
[09:36:41] <imode> you have an entire genre of "things" that old-school mail is "good at".
[09:36:44] <imode> and you can riff on that.
[09:36:53] <dimadima> i've thought of like play-by-mail chess
[09:36:57] <dimadima> my mind wanders in those directions
[09:37:13] <dimadima> that would all be great
[09:37:14] <imode> collaborative D&D sessions with an automated dungeon master.
[09:37:29] <imode> means you need group-like "send if all users are ready" functionality.
[09:37:37] <imode> that expands into game management... etc.
[09:37:43] <dimadima> yeah
[09:37:49] <imode> that's scope creep.
[09:37:51] <dimadima> yeah fuck all that this was hard enough
[09:37:52] <dimadima> lol
[09:37:55] <imode> exactly. ;)
[09:38:16] <imode> I can't resist those corner cases, so I'm building myself some tools to let me explore all of them.
[09:38:20] <dimadima> if that's what you mean then my natural abilities were a solid firewall against scope creep
[09:38:37] <imode> and that's why you'll be more successful than me!
[09:38:38] <dimadima> i'm telling you i did every stupid thing possible
[09:38:43] <dimadima> who knows
[09:39:21] <dimadima> everything is about messaging and communications
[09:39:34] <dimadima> you can built the best shit and totally fail to explain it to ppl, or to find your audience
[09:39:54] <imode> I should've stuck with teaching.
[09:40:02] <dimadima> teaching is awesome
[09:40:49] <dimadima> 350m transaction systems are also awesome though, even if they're for j bezos
[09:40:59] <dimadima> amazon is an incredible thing
[09:41:16] <dimadima> ppl rag on amazon a lot, and it deserves to be ragged on, but it's pretty amazing imo
[09:41:19] <imode> if I was given free reign we could do 1b.
[09:42:00] <dimadima> maybe they will
[09:42:00] <imode> the scale at which we do things scares me.
[09:42:08] <dimadima> yeah man
[09:42:09] <imode> nothing should be this large.
[09:42:55] <dimadima> ideally
[09:45:42] <dimadima> pretty ridiculous they got geneva.com
[09:46:00] <dimadima> i like how someone was shilling texts.com the other month on hacker news
[09:46:10] <dimadima> it was the most spectacular shill i've ever seen, in fact
[09:48:54] <dimadima> maybe it wasn't even a shill, it was that good
[09:52:15] <imode> shilling is an artform.
[09:52:20] <imode> one I hope to never excel at.
[09:52:27] <imode> and yeah.. they paid like, 10k for it.
[09:52:39] <dimadima> that's it
[09:52:44] <dimadima> 10k for geneva.com?
[09:52:51] <imode> may have been north of that, idk.
[09:53:10] <dimadima> whatever
[09:53:19] <dimadima> i don't get the purpose of creating an app like geneva
[09:53:33] <dimadima> any idea how that's doing
[09:53:47] <dimadima> "Available on iOS, Android, and web (plus a desktop app coming this summer)"
[09:53:49] <imode> they've hired and fired more people than I can count.
[09:53:50] <dimadima> it's fall
[09:53:53] <imode> yeah.
[09:54:00] <imode> I tried to kill myself after I was forced to resign.
[09:54:08] <imode> that should tell you a lot about them.
[09:54:09] <dimadima> man
[09:54:21] <dimadima> christ
[09:54:29] <imode> life went downhill after 2016.
[09:54:38] <imode> fuck this startup culture bullshit.
[09:54:38] <dimadima> oh that was around back then?
[09:54:49] <imode> that was 2019. it's been a slow descent since 2016.
[09:55:13] <dimadima> but uh amazon is chiller though?
[09:55:15] <imode> on and off suicide attempts, manic depressive episodes.
[09:55:22] <imode> it's at least much nicer.
[09:55:27] <imode> geneva was 996 work.
[09:55:32] <dimadima> pfffg
[09:55:42] <dimadima> for some assholes
[09:55:45] <dimadima> that sucks
[09:56:11] <imode> at one point during that "fall from grace", I was convinced I couldn't write code.
[09:56:25] <dimadima> how come?
[09:56:43] <imode> because I was told that I couldn't code by someone I valued as an authority that turned malicious.
[09:56:56] <imode> aka a dude who understood node and typescript and that's about it.
[09:57:30] <dimadima> and you were building in go?
[09:57:38] <imode> put it to you this way, when I joined in _april_ of 2019, I was tasked with designing essentially the whole thing from the ground up excluding the CRUD shit for account management.
[09:58:27] <imode> by _june_ I had a functional product, a working concurrency framework that emulated a lot of erlang's idioms (processes managing subprocesses, etc), a full build system that could do hot-reloading within containers..
[09:58:34] <imode> and was working on multicloud.
[09:59:17] <imode> by _august_, we had hired more engineers to flood our team, and I was told that everything needed to conform to some arbitrary design documents, use dependency injection everywhere, and needed to look "more like typescript".
[09:59:30] <imode> despite the fact that typescript and go share very few common idioms.
[09:59:36] <dimadima> very few
[10:00:17] <dimadima> they are both programming languages
[10:00:40] <imode> at the end of it all, I was convinced that I was in the wrong, sent to work on the typescript stack while a couple of node developers cannibalized my backend and replaced practically every inch of it with, I shit you not, a functionally identical but _far more verbose_ version of most of my code.
[10:00:59] <dimadima> wow
[10:01:06] <dimadima> why
[10:01:11] <dimadima> cause they flooded the team w/ node ppl
[10:01:12] <dimadima> ?
[10:01:14] <imode> people enjoy controlling other people.
[10:01:33] <dimadima> but if they're trying to build a product
[10:01:38] <dimadima> and they have a backend
[10:01:38] <imode> hah!
[10:01:48] <dimadima> they're also then just engaging in self-sabotage as welllll
[10:01:50] <dimadima> conceptually
[10:02:02] <imode> oh they were fully convinced that it was for the good of the company.
[10:02:06] <imode> you assume rational actors.
[10:02:09] <imode> so did I, at that point.
[10:02:41] <dimadima> they re-wrote it when it was working before it launched?
[10:02:45] <imode> yup.
[10:02:49] <dimadima> i re-wrote my shit like a million times but never when it was working
[10:02:53] <dimadima> lol
[10:03:02] <imode> the whole thing was roughly... 12 files.
[10:03:10] <imode> less than 50k LoC.
[10:03:11] <dimadima> there were parts of my app, especially the front end, that would work like 80%, 90%
[10:03:18] <dimadima> took many rewrites to get to 100%
[10:03:22] <dimadima> or the adoption of some tool
[10:03:24] <dimadima> that helped a lot
[10:03:39] <dimadima> that's crazy imode
[10:03:59] <imode> at the end it was roughly 70+ at 300k LoC. I wasn't sure how they did it.
[10:04:00] <dimadima> one might say that's a lot of LoC per file
[10:04:08] <dimadima> "might" say
[10:04:11] <dimadima> but if it works stfu and useit
[10:04:25] <imode> it may have been less than 50, I sadly lost the stats.
[10:04:30] <dimadima> whatever
[10:04:52] <imode> it even supported graphQL.
[10:05:04] <imode> like, that was a three day upgrade.
[10:05:20] <imode> because "we needed it", so I needed to autogenerate resolvers for every part of the data model.
[10:05:52] <dimadima> from what did you generate
[10:05:54] <dimadima> a db schema?
[10:06:02] <dimadima> mutations too?
[10:06:43] <imode> yeah we had a bunch of schemas we had to stitch together, and you could send a message by running a mutation.
[10:07:40] <dimadima> what clients did they use in their front ends that it was so worthwhile
[10:07:55] <imode> the iOS folks liked it. apparently.
[10:08:09] <dimadima> so they have some lib that they liked
[10:08:13] <dimadima> to consume the gql
[10:08:19] <dimadima> and it was a must-have
[10:08:25] <imode> and generate it. remember, we're talking node.
[10:08:32] <imode> it's very easy to do GQL stuff in a dynamic language.
[10:08:37] <dimadima> yeah
[10:08:38] <imode> it is _hard_ to do it in go.
[10:08:58] <dimadima> w/ someone like go you'd need code generation
[10:09:10] <dimadima> i'd think
[10:09:14] <dimadima> to make it "easy"
[10:09:46] <imode> some libraries provided it, but we did fork them to make our lives easier.
[10:09:56] <imode> bear in mind, when I was hired, there was nobody else on backend.
[10:10:00] <imode> there was myself and the engineering lead.
[10:10:07] <imode> that's it. that was all.
[10:10:56] <dimadima> they were funded?
[10:11:12] <imode> for a time. they raised quite a bit of funding after I left
[10:11:33] <imode> I remember a conversation that was had about the encryption for group DMs.
[10:12:25] <imode> there were maybe three people that understood what our "crypto dev" had to say (he was from wickr): myself, an intern, and the dude talking. when your engineering lead doesn't understand what's going on, it's going to be chaotic.
[10:12:34] <imode> especially if they don't understand the word "delegate".
[10:13:06] <dimadima> smh
[10:13:47] <dimadima> i'd love to have a crypto story but i'm being honest w/ ppl and saying there is no crypto story lol
[10:14:01] <imode> at least you're honest.
[10:14:03] <dimadima> ppl are like "it's easy just use this lib"
[10:14:15] <dimadima> i'm like stfu
[10:14:21] <imode> they lied about encrypted DMs on launch.
[10:14:25] <dimadima> for sure
[10:14:35] <dimadima> zoom lied
[10:14:39] <dimadima> everyone lies about encrpytion
[10:14:44] <dimadima> it's so annoying
[10:14:48] <imode> the only reason I knew anything about what he was saying was because I worked for a cryptocurrency company and built a shitty wallet in 2014.
[10:15:02] <imode> because I read a few books on cryptography.
[10:15:16] <dimadima> that sphere of knowledge is incredibly vast it seems and requires a lot of pedantic close study
[10:15:26] <imode> because it's mostly about keeping up appearances.
[10:15:54] <dimadima> i mean real knowledge of encryption
[10:16:06] <imode> find some complicated math, find ways to fix up messages using that complicated math.
[10:16:26] <dimadima> that's not encryption though
[10:17:26] <imode> how is it not? :P
[10:18:34] <dimadima> i couldn't tell you
[10:22:18] <dimadima> i function mostly on vibes alone :P
[10:22:37] <imode> mood.
[10:23:04] <imode> I have run out of drink and patience looking at this fucking push_byte/pop_byte combo.
[10:23:25] <imode> I need an actual description of the IR I'm working with instead of this feel-out-and-implement stuff.
[10:23:27] <dimadima> i'm going to do a pro forma deploy of some bullshit
[10:23:35] <dimadima> and will go to sleep after that
[10:23:47] <imode> never deploy on friday! ;)
[10:24:07] <dimadima> these deploys are butter
[10:24:19] <dimadima> also it's saturday
[10:24:25] <imode> shhh... I have 6 more minutes.
[10:25:03] <dimadima> saturday > friday

[10:28:17] <dimadima> ta da
[10:28:37] <dimadima> good night imode
[10:28:43] <dimadima> you have 2 minutes left
[10:28:50] <imode> heh.
[10:28:58] <imode> I'll be up staring at this code for a while.
[10:29:10] <imode> wondering if I can do this masking differently.
[10:31:28] <imode> a bitwise circular buffer is stored as a sequence of whatever word size you configure, meaning that to set a single bit, you first need to clear the original bit and set it to the intended bit, which means generating a mask that looks like `...0001000...`, inverting it to look like `...1110111...`, ANDing it with the word you're on, and then generating the same mask again, but instead of
[10:31:30] <imode> inverting it, you just OR it with the result of the AND.
[10:40:33] <imode> wish I still had a whiteboard.
[10:51:49] <imode> well this evening was cathartic. night all, sorry if I overshared.

[22:06:02] <dimadima> i need to look that up because it strikes me as insane and people were not actually insane back then
[22:06:06] <imode> was more economically viable than helium.
[22:06:28] <dimadima> right but it was... hydrogen lol
[22:06:38] <imode> we use combustible fuel in modern cars. :P
[22:06:54] <dimadima> i dunnnnno
[22:07:16] <imode> cars iirc used to blow up back then in similar but smaller fashion.
[22:08:22] <dimadima> if the fuel in your car combusts, even spontaneously due to electrostatics, you'll smell it, stop it, and get out
[22:08:31] <dimadima> i once saw that happen to a car in front of me in my high school parking lot
[22:08:49] <dimadima> toyota camry (station wagon!) caught fire for no apparent reason
[22:09:00] <imode> imagine how common that was in the model T days.
[22:09:12] <dimadima> but i dunno a gigantic uhhhh airship of hydrogen
[22:09:16] <dimadima> ppl knew chemistry back in those days
[22:09:22] <dimadima> and there were great engineers
[22:09:31] <dimadima> i need to read more about this
[22:09:57] <dimadima> im just saying you don't fall to the earth in a great ball of fire if your model T combusts
[22:10:06] <imode> bahahaha.
[22:10:31] <imode> I'm just surprised it only killed 35 people.
[22:10:44] <dimadima> nazis
[22:10:54] <dimadima> (jk no idea who it killed)
[22:11:19] <imode> "Just over twice as many (73 of 76 on board) had perished when the helium-filled U.S. Navy scout airship USS Akron crashed at sea off the New Jersey coast four years earlier on April 4, 1933."
[22:11:26] <imode> looks like airships are just dangerous, man.
[22:11:58] <dimadima> they're probably hard to control, with or without the flammable gas
[22:15:19] <dimadima> yesterday i recorded a series of intro and walk through videos that now have to look through
[22:15:23] <dimadima> don't know how to twitched imode
[22:15:33] <dimadima> watching and hearing myself is quite painful
[22:16:41] <bontaq> well there's your problem did an episode on airships / the hindenburgh.  like every single one was destroyed by accident, with maybe 1 making it to a "normal" retirement
[22:17:32] <imode> dimadima: that was my reaction too. your brain does a lot of processing on your voice because you can hear yourself in a different form through your skull.
[22:17:36] <imode> a lot of bass is cut out.
[22:18:54] <dimadima> this is going to be terrible. i'm just going to have to deal with it
