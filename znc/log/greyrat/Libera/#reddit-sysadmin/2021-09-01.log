[02:11:13] <Hunterkll> Use reservations to hand out DHCP IPs outside of a scope
[02:11:42] <Hunterkll> so I've got a scope that the family uses, and a bunch of DHCP servers/devices, those all get reservations outside of scope
[02:12:04] <Hunterkll> like the openspot, printer, etc that multiple people use, so it's a fixed IP, but doesn't impact how many random devices can hook to the wireless or dumb shit like that
[02:12:28] <Hunterkll> not a pain in the ass to renumber, but still lets me DHCP everything 
[02:13:05] <Activ8> What Hunterkll is trying to say is turn off IPV6 on the DHCP Scope then it will let you add a DHCP Reservation outside of the Scope.
[02:13:14] <Hunterkll> i'm not using windows DHCP however :p
[02:13:25] <Activ8> then you can scope while you scope
[02:13:26] <Hunterkll> windows DHCP you just set up the scope as the entire subnet and exclude the range you want to use like i'm using 
[02:13:50] <Activ8> yeh set it as an entire subnet 
[02:14:08] <Hunterkll> so i'd set the entire /26 as the DHCP range and exclude .1-.35 
[02:14:13] <Hunterkll> then set reservations in .1-.35 range
[02:14:26] <Hunterkll> each DHCP implementation has dumb quirks like this

[02:30:40] <signofzeta> But on the fourth or fifth try, I got someone who knows to put paper in their hand before they wipe, and they managed to do it for me.
[02:31:52] <Hunterkll> i just have the devops people do that for me
[02:32:01] *** Joins: rpifan (~rpifan@user/rpifan)
[02:32:02] <rpifan> ugh
[02:32:07] <rpifan> gaming was getting good and it crashed
[02:32:08] <Activ8> The thing about tech support some people will go above and beyond and know the question your asking by understanding.
[02:32:10] <rpifan> i hope AOE autosaves
[02:32:27] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: lol
[02:32:42] <Activ8> but there’s some people in tech support who don’t care to understand you and they will fuck up any way they can by doing something wrong.
[02:33:27] <Activ8> then you have people like Hunterkll who keeps telling people to disable ipv6 all the time.
[02:33:29] *** Quits: rpifan (~rpifan@user/rpifan) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:34:12] <Hunterkll> ahhh 
[02:34:15] *** Joins: Work-BWMerlin (~Work-BWMe@103.24.208.242)
[02:34:16] <Hunterkll> projection at it's finest 
[02:34:27] <Activ8> I mean Hunterkll was on a support call the other day about DNSSEC right, and he told the customer to disable ipv6.  Then he closed the ticket without even asking if the problem was fixed.
[02:34:28] <Hunterkll> <insert red hat joke here>
[02:34:41] <Activ8> 😛😛😛😛
[02:34:57] <Hunterkll> making tech support ...... ;) Activ8's the forefront of that movement
[02:35:12] <Activ8> Bahahahaha so funny
[02:35:43] <Activ8> i don’t really do tech support 
[02:36:10] <Hunterkll> we had a guy say i dont really do tickets so what are you talking about?
[02:36:16] <Hunterkll> so i keep slipping him tickets to see how long till he notices
[02:36:24] <Hunterkll> like "server is down" tickets from monitoring 
[02:36:26] <Hunterkll> hehe
[02:36:42] <Activ8> That’s awesome I love it
[02:36:58] <Hunterkll> it's all false alerts or idiots watching the dashboard who don't pay attention to maint schedules and shit
[02:37:12] <Hunterkll> like, a server has a long reboot cycle, its down for more than 5  minutes, both agent and ping response gone 
[02:37:16] <Hunterkll> they open ticket, put it in queue 
[02:37:18] <Hunterkll> i slip it over 
[02:37:19] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:37:34] <Hunterkll> monday "Does anyone know why i had 50 tickets to close and none of them were valid?" 
[02:37:38] <Hunterkll> >tickets like spanning 4 weeks 
[02:37:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:37:40] <Activ8> i worked in a place where they took no notice of schedules lol and they kept saying things where down in the monitoring system 
[02:37:50] <Hunterkll> i mean
[02:37:51] <Activ8> tier 3 got so angry 
[02:37:52] <Hunterkll> no one ever tells me
[02:38:04] <Hunterkll> if they did i can put maint schedules so it shows up in monitoring as "hey ignore this"
[02:38:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:38:17] <Hunterkll> but if ya don't tell me
[02:38:19] <Hunterkll> oh well!
[02:38:22] <Activ8> monitoring auto open tickets I love systems like that
[02:38:29] <Hunterkll> oh ours doesn't
[02:38:29] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:38:40] <Hunterkll> we have live people 24/7 watching dashboards and shit to page out for critical stuff, etc
[02:38:52] <Activ8> i may set something up for our ticket system with monitoring 
[02:38:54] <Hunterkll> bit of a large network 
[02:39:10] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i mean, I can output status: new and status: closed in email lines
[02:39:17] <Hunterkll> if the ticket system can interpret that to auto-close tickets
[02:39:21] <Hunterkll> then we could do so mething like that 
[02:39:43] <Hunterkll> email templates are stupid flexible with all kinda variables and scripting ican do 
[02:40:02] <fritzwastaken> nerds
[02:40:02] <Activ8> I would just get the monitoring system to email an email with monitoring info which then polls into the ticket system
[02:40:39] <Hunterkll> fuck that the servicenow team can figure out how to do whatever they want
[02:40:40] <Hunterkll> LOL
[02:40:46] <Activ8> i love nerds the little packets of sweet n sour candy 
[02:40:50] <Activ8> haven’t had them for ages
[02:41:15] <DOMF> So I'm like, really bad at finding new jobs. 
[02:41:26] <DOMF> Most of the jobs I've gotten have just like fallen into my lap
[02:41:42] <DOMF> At a point now where I need to actively look and apply - is linkedin absolute shit?
[02:41:48] <Activ8> Hunterkll I don’t work in a team really there’s two of us to do tickets.  The business is tiny! Only has about 25 clients and it’s enough to make the business float 😊
[02:41:55] <DOMF> Where do y'all recommend? I'm looking for devops/kubernetes/aws work
[02:42:18] <fritzwastaken> onlyfans just re-allowed explicit content
[02:42:24] <fritzwastaken> lets see you twerk
[02:42:24] <Hunterkll> fritzwastaken: yea like 2 days ago
[02:42:25] <Hunterkll> catch up
[02:42:26] <Activ8> we are 40 tickets away from our 1000 service desk ticket closure.  All tickets are 100% valid from customers.
[02:42:30] <DOMF> (I would also take a linux sysadmin job if it pays a lot)
[02:42:42] <Work-BWMerlin> https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html time to roll that into production
[02:42:47] <fritzwastaken> Hunterkll: how many only fans are you subbed to"
[02:42:55] <Hunterkll> fritzwastaken: just gibby's
[02:43:01] <Hunterkll> DOMF: i mean, linkedin, recruiters, asking around in general, not that bad really 
[02:43:04] <Activ8> Lol
[02:43:16] <Hunterkll> DOMF: if your linkedin is well brushed up you get hit up by recruiters/companies on the regular it feels
[02:43:28] <Hunterkll> just avoid robert half 
[02:43:33] <Hunterkll> the recruiting company
[02:43:36] <Hunterkll> they're scummy as fuck
[02:43:47] <Activ8> I come off linked in
[02:43:49] <Hunterkll> but yea, recruiters can be valuble 
[02:43:55] <Activ8> too many recruiter messages
[02:44:16] <Activ8> i deleted my profile back in 2017
[02:44:36] <Hunterkll> i've been hit up by recruiters from my own company before who aren't paying too much attention LOL
[02:44:50] <Hunterkll> I just hit them up on internal IM "yo, you should pay more attention hah"
[02:45:02] <DOMF> I applied for a job and then a recruiter called me back and I realized that it was the recruiter I applied to, I looked them up and there's a bunch of reddit posts saying they're scammy
[02:45:02] <Activ8> That’s awesome
[02:45:04] <DOMF> "Jobot"
[02:45:16] <Hunterkll> never heard of 'em
[02:45:17] <Activ8> Jobs worth 
[02:45:29] <DOMF> Apparently it was the founder of a different recruiter called "CyberCoders"
[02:45:34] <DOMF> who were also scammy
[02:45:36] <DOMF> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:45:52] <Hunterkll> I mean, shit like ziprecruiter can't hurt to pop your resume into either
[02:46:04] <DOMF> maybe my linkedin is just shit, I haven't gotten hit up by anyone
[02:46:09] <Activ8> I feel like spam has increased over the years in tech even worse than Bonzi Buddy and popups 
[02:46:11] <DOMF> ooh yeah I'll try ziprecruiter, thanks!
[02:46:33] <Hunterkll> I mean, if you get desperate, robert half will probably find you a place, but i've heard a lot of horror stories out of them
[02:46:39] <Hunterkll> but using it to find a stopgap crutch ain't too bad
[02:46:48] <Activ8> zip recruiter is advertised on Leo Leoport’s tech show on twit.tv
[02:46:51] <Activ8> hes great
[02:47:06] <DOMF> I got hella ghosted by a Robert Half recruiter last summer and I'm still pissed about it cause I really wanted the job
[02:47:12] <DOMF> Leo! <3 
[02:47:14] <Hunterkll> like i said 
[02:47:16] <Hunterkll> they're half :P
[02:47:18] <Activ8> i listen to him n his crew n I’m from the UK
[02:47:24] <DOMF> I worked for Leo's ISP back in the day
[02:47:26] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i mean, that's like saying that linus tech tips endorses graphics cards though
[02:47:29] <Hunterkll> they're getting paid either way
[02:47:38] <DOMF> so I got to talk to him when he accidentally got a $50k bill
[02:47:39] <Hunterkll> and only siding with good-ish PR'd companies 
[02:47:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:47:41] <sd> 14<s​olar_sails (XV8)> Looks like VMWare caught it and adjusted the charge, thankfully. Not all hope is lost.
[02:47:46] <Activ8> oh yeh Leo is truthful 
[02:47:52] <Activ8> n that’s what I like about him
[02:48:03] <Activ8> he can joke on but always tells the truth 
[02:48:06] <Hunterkll> well i mean
[02:48:15] <Hunterkll> he's getting paid to mention ziprecruiter 
[02:48:22] <Hunterkll> so as long as they're not too scummy and have an ok reputation
[02:48:24] <Hunterkll> he'll onboard it
[02:48:30] <signofzeta> yes, but he says Lisa has used it to hire internally at TWiT
[02:48:33] <Activ8> oh yeh of course that’s advertisements but I don’t mind them 
[02:48:34] <Hunterkll> which puts it in the same boat as linus tech tips endorsing GPUs
[02:48:54] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: absolutely, but still - have to keep it in mind 
[02:49:02] <Hunterkll> and yea they seem on the up and up and all that but at the end of the day
[02:49:51] <Hunterkll> jeeze
[02:49:55] <Activ8> I personally don’t think they use many of the products they advertise though.  They know them well enough to promote and to chat about them.
[02:49:56] <Hunterkll> time to clear out my linkedin box again -_-
[02:50:12] <Hunterkll> > Radar Systems Engineer
[02:50:57] <Activ8> I used to get 50 messages a day from recruiters
[02:51:27] <Hunterkll> DOMF: if you don't mind potential government work, i've had good experiences (on the other side) with these guys at smaller customer sites who they've brought in - https://ingersollconsulting.net/
[02:52:10] <Activ8> Anyone use docker just received an email about new terms and agreements
[02:52:43] <Hunterkll> heh
[02:52:54] <Hunterkll> AWS recruiter for IC work 
[02:52:56] <Hunterkll> nooooo thank you 
[02:53:46] <Hunterkll> DOMF: oh yea, one good thing on linkedin to do is accept invites from recruiters and shit for network connections ..... increases visibility in segments you want to be in 
[02:54:04] <DOMF> Hunterkll, when you say government work, do you mean like county governments or like .mil
[02:54:20] <DOMF> I draw the line at work that causes people to get blown to bits
[02:54:30] <Hunterkll> federal/state
[02:54:32] <Hunterkll> can be a big mix
[02:54:37] <Hunterkll> don't think it'd go down to county though
[02:54:47] <Hunterkll> but i started many years ago on an HHS (health and human services) contract 
[02:55:04] <DOMF> yeah I'd be HELLA down with that
[02:55:06] <Hunterkll> and there's lots of shit like EPA, FAA, FCC, etc floating around 
[02:55:12] <Hunterkll> tons of DoD work too 
[02:55:34] <DOMF> doesn't look like they're hiring for my kind of thing right now though
[02:55:37] <Hunterkll> but getting a clearance and maintaining an email server is a far cry from being a radar engineer or a land system/weapon platform engineer 
[02:55:50] <Hunterkll> last one's probably the only reason i'd consider going into the contract side full time, lol
[02:56:04] <Hunterkll> well, drop them a line anyway - you know these places keep shit on file 
[02:56:36] <Hunterkll> DOMF: but yea, if you check network connections, sometimes they put mini job descriptions in the invites - like this one i'm about to accept that says "Hi, Job title: SCCM-Lead, two locations, full time, <healthcare company> " 
[02:57:34] <Hunterkll> DOMF: here's another decent one also - https://talentwerx.io/
[02:58:48] <sd> 09<H​aise> Hunterkll: you still running that Exchange box at home ?
[02:59:14] <Hunterkll> why .... wouldn't I be?
[02:59:44] <Activ8> Migration to cloud
[02:59:46] <sd> 09<H​aise> Just asking cause I have spare domain that I might waste for on prem server
[03:00:03] <Hunterkll> mine's set up hybrid using O365 as a smart host for inbound and outbound mail 
[03:00:12] <DOMF> Thanks so much hfor all the recommendations Hunterkll 
[03:00:15] <sd> 09<H​aise> Ah so SMTP Relay ?
[03:00:21] <Activ8> lol
[03:00:22] <Hunterkll> well no
[03:00:29] <Hunterkll> bitch i dont wanna pay for more mailbox licenses 
[03:00:33] <Hunterkll> I only have 5x O365 E3's 
[03:00:44] <signalblue> not an SMTP relay per se
[03:00:48] <signalblue> MAPI
[03:01:01] <Hunterkll> nah it speaks SMTP out to O365 with cert auth 
[03:01:02] <Activ8> what a waste of E3s 😂
[03:01:09] <signalblue> Hunter's not sending/receiving on his IP
[03:01:16] <Hunterkll> signalblue: ah, but i am for other domains
[03:01:25] <Hunterkll> well, via a linode instance that's site-site'd, and via native IPv6 locally
[03:01:29] <signalblue> residential IP's?
[03:01:36] <signalblue> no, right?
[03:02:11] <sd> 09<H​aise> I am probably gonna rent VPS and do site to site with Wireguard and setup mail server in my lab
[03:02:18] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Yes and no
[03:02:20] <Activ8> Don’t be silly Hunterkll has his own data centre under his house
[03:02:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> I’ve done both a long time
[03:02:59] <sd> 09<H​aise> Does your shit end up in spam at all ?
[03:03:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Nope because I know wtf I’m doing 🙂
[03:03:26] <Activ8> Should never end up in spam
[03:03:54] <signalblue> not in spam because he's been doing this for a LONG time I assume
[03:04:02] <sd> 09<H​aise> Gotcha lol, I am probably gonna look into SMTP Relay like AWS SES for relaying my outgoing mails
[03:04:09] <signalblue> but MS always sends my reletively new setup to spam
[03:04:13] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Which is why I use O365 for my external in/out on my primary domain
[03:04:24] <signalblue> Ok then
[03:04:36] <signalblue> do your other domains end up in spam sometimes?
[03:04:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Nope
[03:05:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Because I’ve registered with or opened tickets with providers and know what they want to be happy otherwise
[03:05:36] <Hunterkll> I've helped a fair amount of people stop getting their email spamfiltered
[03:05:40] <signalblue> yeah
[03:05:43] <Hunterkll> hell, I know how to make AOL stop spamfiltering you ;)
[03:05:49] <signalblue> How?
[03:05:56] <Hunterkll> open a ticket with verizon LOL
[03:05:58] <signalblue> AOL = Yahoo/Verizon
[03:06:00] <signalblue> LOL
[03:06:01] <Activ8> If you happy and you know it don’t let my mail go to spam n clap your hands
[03:06:06] <Hunterkll> and have everything in line before you start sending
[03:06:24] <Hunterkll> but every major provider has routes
[03:06:24] <signalblue> yeah well that's DMARC, SPF, DKIM, and TLS
[03:06:28] <Hunterkll> nah
[03:06:39] <Hunterkll> SPF and TLS oppertunistic support is really all you need (right now) 
[03:06:53] <signalblue> I like to go the extra route
[03:07:11] <signalblue> But yeah if you're relaying, then that's true
[03:07:23] <signofzeta> DKIM is highly recommended, too.  DMARC reporting is nice to have, but for personal stuff, maybe you can skip that.
[03:07:36] <signalblue> In fact my relay provider enforces DKIM
[03:07:39] <signalblue> so that's that
[03:07:44] <signalblue> SMTP2Go
[03:08:14] <signalblue> and I don't send personal emails much if at all
[03:08:19] <Hunterkll> no, without relaying
[03:08:24] <Hunterkll> i'm talking straight from residential ISP ranges
[03:08:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:08:32] <signalblue> LOL
[03:08:43] <signalblue> the FiOS ranges are on a few blacklists
[03:08:47] <signalblue> and NOTHING will get through
[03:08:56] <signalblue> We're talking AS701 here
[03:09:03] <Hunterkll> signalblue: like for microsoft, having your IP registered in JMRP 
[03:09:15] <Hunterkll> yea, and good setups weight blacklists 
[03:09:29] <Hunterkll> i ran for like 10 years off a comcast residential line with a static IP no issue
[03:09:29] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:09:36] <signalblue> comcast is TRASH
[03:09:47] <Hunterkll> I've been trying to get a comcast line out here forever - even offered to pay to run it
[03:09:49] <signalblue> is owning a block a requirement for JMRP?
[03:09:52] <Hunterkll> almost had it done too before the Title II repeal
[03:09:53] <Hunterkll> fuck  no
[03:09:58] <signalblue> got it
[03:09:59] <Hunterkll> my residential non-comcast ISP IP is registered
[03:10:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:10:07] <signalblue> comcast is not good at all
[03:10:11] <Hunterkll> but i'd much rather (tech wise) have a comcast line 
[03:10:25] <Hunterkll> i've had comcast since they were @home before they merged up and have delt with them many times over the past few years
[03:10:30] <Hunterkll> Tech wise, they're top notch 
[03:10:30] <signalblue> I spent every day on the phone with them because their stuff would go down
[03:10:51] <Hunterkll> A-KO once had their lead IPv6 engineer pressure Juniper to fix a bug lol 
[03:10:57] <signalblue> and no ISP will condigure rDNS for you
[03:11:02] <signalblue> configure*
[03:11:07] <Hunterkll> LOL
[03:11:10] <Hunterkll> yes, yes they will
[03:11:13] <signalblue> as in add a PTR record for an IP to hostname
[03:11:19] <Hunterkll> yes they will
[03:11:19] <signalblue> not Verizon residential
[03:11:23] <signalblue> I called
[03:11:28] <Hunterkll> do you have a static/
[03:11:28] <Hunterkll> ?
[03:11:39] <signalblue> even for business, that question seemed to faze them
[03:11:47] <signalblue> for my house, it's dynamic
[03:11:55] <Hunterkll> then they can't set an rdns 
[03:11:58] <signalblue> rught
[03:12:00] <Hunterkll> that'd just be insane to manage/run 
[03:12:00] <signalblue> right*
[03:12:07] <signofzeta> Every ISP has been willing to set PTR records for static IP space assigned to me.  Heck, even IPv6 space they've assigned.
[03:12:13] <signalblue> Hunterkll, you have static IP's at home?
[03:12:15] <Hunterkll> yes
[03:12:16] <Hunterkll> of course
[03:12:20] <Hunterkll> it's only an extra $5/mo for a single
[03:12:24] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> good morning everyone
[03:12:25] <Hunterkll> why the hell not? makes life simpler by far
[03:12:32] <signalblue> that's considered commercial?
[03:12:33] <Hunterkll> i would never even think to ask for rdns on a dynamic 
[03:12:35] <Hunterkll> signalblue: nope
[03:12:36] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> happy...err... wednesday
[03:12:37] <Hunterkll> it's a consumer plan 
[03:12:41] <signalblue> makes sense
[03:12:43] <Hunterkll> did the same with comcast 
[03:12:48] <Hunterkll> consumer plan, static ip 
[03:12:49] <signalblue> yeal well that influences mail flow
[03:12:59] <Hunterkll> well, why the fuck would you run a mailserver on dynamic?
[03:13:03] * gibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[03:13:07] <Hunterkll> i figured it was assumed we were talking statics 
[03:13:08] <signalblue> why not?
[03:13:14] <sd> 09<H​aise> oh boy
[03:13:22] <signalblue> I run my own nameserver and changing the IP is stupid simple
[03:13:26] <Hunterkll> because you'll get blocked/fucked half the ti me, and the last jackass with a virus who had your ip before means you're entirely blackholed?
[03:13:28] <signalblue> it's a simple sed command
[03:13:33] <sd> 09<H​aise> That is why I am buying VPS, to avoid residential IP
[03:13:44] <signalblue> and getting a new IP is stupid simple as well
[03:14:06] <signalblue> hence the SMTP relaying
[03:14:07] <Hunterkll> @Haise For naked communications, I use policy based routing for my exchange to go out via a linode instance for IPv4, and just use my IPv6 tunnel locally with no routing fuckery 
[03:14:35] <Hunterkll> site-site IPsec to the single IP $5/mo linode, PBR/NAT(on the linode side) to move traffic back and forth 
[03:14:43] <signalblue> I have a commercial FiOS service which is like a 40 min drive away
[03:14:54] <sd> 09<H​aise> I am gonna do either Linode or OVH
[03:14:59] <Hunterkll> yea if you got that then who cares
[03:15:09] <sd> 09<H​aise> And instead of IPsec I am doing Wireguard
[03:15:11] <signalblue> Hunterkll: what IPsec server software are you using?
[03:15:13] <Hunterkll> tbh the static at home was mostly to be able to reliably SSH/RDP back for the most part

[03:15:36] <signalblue> then it's just glue records to worry about
[03:15:46] <Hunterkll> signalblue: then whatever's in the VyOS software on the OVH side

[03:17:48] <signalblue> Virtual Tunnel Interface
[03:17:50] <Hunterkll> virtual tunnel interface
[03:17:58] <Hunterkll> route-based interfaces
[03:18:05] <signalblue> cisco proprietary
[03:18:11] <signalblue> or I think it is
[03:18:12] <Hunterkll> so it provides actual interfaces on each router/hop
[03:18:18] <signalblue> yeah
[03:18:29] <signalblue> what's your BBS phone number?
[03:18:32] <Hunterkll> considering the only cisco gear in play is an ASA providing my home VPN for laptops and shit

[03:19:54] <signalblue> oh and my mailing solution is mailcow if you were intersted
[03:19:57] <signalblue> interested*
[03:20:52] <signalblue> 90% on par with Exchange as far as mailing is concerned mailing
[03:21:03] <signalblue> can't do holds though
[03:21:20] <Hunterkll> probably things like online archive and stuff like that in a variety of ways too
[03:21:24] <Hunterkll> might have some stuff that resembles it, but eh
[03:21:32] <Hunterkll> exchange is a beast if you need it
[03:21:41] <Hunterkll> if all you're doing is mail might as well whip up a sendmail config and call it a day 
[03:21:48] <signalblue> gotta remember that this is a linux solution that is free
[03:21:54] <Hunterkll> and use the /var/mail for what it's meant for 
[03:22:01] <signalblue> and pure SMTP is kinda useless lol
[03:22:05] <sd> 09<H​aise> signalblue: I am doing Linux based mail server
[03:22:09] <signalblue> because is just not all that useable
[03:22:18] <Hunterkll> signalblue: hence you use a mail client that reads from /var/mail and ssh into the mail server to handle email
[03:22:19] <Hunterkll> :D
[03:22:37] <signalblue> so like send email straight from SMTP?
[03:22:38] <signalblue> yeah right
[03:22:51] <Hunterkll> well, you obviously submit it to sendmail first.....
[03:23:00] <Hunterkll> or have another daemon that picks up outgoing mail 
[03:23:04] <signalblue> this has spam filtering, search, webmail and that list goes on and on and on
[03:23:20] <Hunterkll> oddly enough, for spam filtering, mcafee has a really good product
[03:23:22] <Hunterkll> if you're using exchange
[03:23:27] <signalblue> but before that, yes.

[03:26:09] <Hunterkll> the one that's like
[03:26:19] <Hunterkll> "i clicked a link labeled horse porn, i don't know what i was expecting"
[03:26:35] <signalblue> huter quick question, if you have static IP addressing, why O365 relay?
[03:27:05] <Hunterkll> for the same reason (with this ISP) I use the linode with policy based routing for external IPv4 for my exchange
[03:27:17] <Hunterkll> i don't want to pay as much as they want for port 25 to be unblocked
[03:27:18] <Hunterkll> :D
[03:27:29] <Hunterkll> comcast I didn't have that issue
[03:27:47] <Hunterkll> and we had to upgrade to a mid-high tier plan to get ports below 1024 unblocked a while back 
[03:27:56] <signalblue> that's BS
[03:28:06] <Hunterkll> i think they changed the low port blocking rules though
[03:28:10] <Hunterkll> we did that....... 10 years ago?
[03:28:10] <sd> 09<H​aise> Thanks for all of info Hunterkll
[03:28:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:28:27] <signalblue> so O365 bypasses the ISP port blockage?
[03:28:40] <sd> 09<H​aise> No VPN should do that
[03:28:42] <Hunterkll> since it's not using 25, yes.....
[03:28:47] <Hunterkll> wait
[03:28:47] <sd> 09<H​aise> Oh
[03:28:48] <Hunterkll> no
[03:28:52] <Hunterkll> nevermind, i forgot
[03:28:58] <signalblue> well VPN and O365, both
[03:28:59] <Hunterkll> all exchange traffic is routed via the linode for IPv4 
[03:29:14] <Hunterkll> so even O365 relayed traffic comes via the linode IP
[03:29:25] <corn266> burnt nert nert nert nert
[03:29:30] <Hunterkll> all internal outbound non-local traffic is PBR'd via the linode tunnel 
[03:29:33] <signalblue> so it's fully linoded
[03:29:34] <Hunterkll> and the linode VM is NATing shit back 
[03:29:36] <corn266> I WILL NOT LOCK MY DOOR
[03:29:39] <Hunterkll> signalblue: except for IPv6 traffic
[03:29:42] <signalblue> yeah
[03:29:46] <signalblue> except for that
[03:29:48] <Hunterkll> only IPv4 
[03:29:49] <corn266> lmao
[03:29:49] <signalblue> because it's v4
[03:29:58] <corn266> still on this IPv6 Hunterkll?

[03:30:11] <corn266> no
[03:30:14] <signalblue> he.net for v6
[03:30:15] <corn266> maybe
[03:30:17] <Hunterkll> signalblue: was fun diagnosing why i had mailing issues initially - some would work, some would fail - not like, spamfilter, but just fail to deliver/send successfully 
[03:30:28] <signalblue> yeah
[03:30:28] <Hunterkll> signalblue: had to fiddle with MSS clamping settings over the ipsec tunnel 
[03:30:31] <Hunterkll> that was fun times
[03:30:38] <signalblue> I don't really send out much if at all
[03:30:39] <Hunterkll> figured that out like 4 years ago when i moved things around 
[03:30:44] <Hunterkll> signalblue: it affected receive too
[03:30:53] <signalblue> it's just receiving transactional stuff
[03:30:56] <Hunterkll> connections would get butchered 
[03:31:04] <signalblue> email can be a complicated beast
[03:31:11] <Hunterkll> nah
[03:31:16] <signalblue> just like DNS...
[03:31:20] <Hunterkll> this would have affected at least the transit speed of any transfers/downloads, etc
[03:31:22] <gibby> !dns
[03:31:22] <DoTheNeedful> It's Always DNS.
[03:31:33] <Hunterkll> it would cause any full size packets to get fucked up and butchered 
[03:31:34] <signalblue> really really really simple but people complicate it
[03:31:35] *** Joins: codemin (~codemin@69.167.6.173)
[03:31:54] <signalblue> sounds like an MTU issue from the surface
[03:31:57] <Hunterkll> yes
[03:32:08] <Hunterkll> signalblue: MSS clamping trims down the maximum MTU of the link
[03:32:08] <Hunterkll> ;)
[03:32:13] <signalblue> yeah
[03:32:21] <Hunterkll> but because I had IPv6 running
[03:32:27] <signalblue> that would explain it
[03:32:28] <Hunterkll> it initially was crazy to figure out, because some worked
[03:32:29] <Hunterkll> some didn't
[03:32:43] <signalblue> MSS takes precedence over MTU
[03:32:44] <Hunterkll> exchange's glorious logs though 
[03:33:27] <signalblue> any daemon has pretty glorious logs
[03:33:40] <Hunterkll> hahahahahhaha wow
[03:33:40] <signalblue> any good* one
[03:33:44] <Hunterkll> nah
[03:33:45] <Hunterkll> not even good ones
[03:33:57] <signalblue> I can write a crappy one that does no logging
[03:34:23] <Hunterkll> but yea, i have it set to 1436 on all 5 of my ipsec tunnels now just to head off issues even if the other sides can handle more
[03:34:34] <signalblue> I like how IRC users don't see when someone is typing
[03:34:43] <xe0n> morn
[03:34:49] <signalblue> ing
[03:35:09] <Hunterkll> signalblue: fun thing, in edgerouter land, the config line on the interface is 'mtu 1436' to actually set mss 1436 
[03:35:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:35:26] <gibby> good morning xe0n 
[03:35:29] <signalblue> ubiquiti
[03:35:30] <signalblue> lol
[03:35:40] <Hunterkll> so on a cisco i'd do ip tcp adjust mss 1436, edgeroutoer it's mtu 1436 for the same thing
[03:35:42] * gibby hands xe0n a coffee with two espresso shots
[03:35:44] <Hunterkll> signalblue: nah, that's a holdover from vyatta
[03:35:57] <Hunterkll> signalblue: in fact, it's also mtu 1436 for the same thing on the brocade vRouter product too
[03:35:59] <signalblue> edgerouter is ubiquiti though
[03:36:00] <Hunterkll> and in VyOS 
[03:36:18] <Hunterkll> signalblue: yes, and VyOS, EdgeOS, and brocade's lineup all spawned from Vyatta.....
[03:36:23] <Hunterkll> brocade directly, since they just bought out vyatta
[03:36:29] <signalblue> yeah
[03:36:39] <signalblue> Cingular was nice
[03:36:40] <Hunterkll> VyOS and EdgeOS are successors of the vyatta core open source side of vyatta
[03:36:44] <signalblue> back in the day
[03:36:44] <Hunterkll> .... what?
[03:37:02] <signalblue> Cingular, the phone company?
[03:37:05] <Hunterkll> i got my first personal cellphone number on cingular because of area code offered, and ported it the same day to t-mobile
[03:37:06] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:37:06] <signalblue> was nice
[03:37:13] <signalblue> why t-mobi;e?
[03:37:25] <Hunterkll> because they're the least suck, if you're not talking about coverage areas, of all the cell companies
[03:37:29] <signalblue> better coverage?
[03:37:31] <signalblue> ah
[03:37:37] <signalblue> they advertise that
[03:37:46] <Hunterkll> I actually did a lot of testing and fun times when they were initially rolling out IPv6 
[03:37:56] <Hunterkll> RIL hacking on android devices to get IPv6 contexts on unsupported devices, etc 
[03:38:09] <signalblue> what testing
[03:38:13] <sd> 09<H​aise> I have Deutsche Telekom for both my phone and home connection
[03:38:33] <Hunterkll> signalblue: when they first started lighting up IPv6 on t-mobile, it was invite only and there were only like, 3 devices that could support it at all 
[03:38:34] <sd> 09<H​aise> Still no IPv6 smh
[03:38:50] <signalblue> As a consumer, why would I care
[03:38:55] <signalblue> as long as it works
[03:38:57] <Hunterkll> now 96% or so of their internal network traffic is IPv6 only, they use 464XLAT to let you access IPv4 shit
[03:39:08] <signofzeta> Ah, I love submitting timesheets during Exchange patching weeks.
[03:39:09] <signalblue> then it can be IPv4 or 6 no problem
[03:39:30] <Hunterkll> heh, all the networks are mostly IPv6 now with some legacy IPv4 support for devices that can't speak it yet 
[03:39:41] <signalblue> but most of the web is v4
[03:39:48] <Hunterkll> hence 464XLAT
[03:40:12] <signalblue> besides a larger addressing pool, v6 doesn't really bring much innovation
[03:40:14] <Hunterkll> you have a virtual IPv4 interface on your device, that gets encapsulated in IPv6, then gets unwrapped on the CGN at the edge before hitting the internet
[03:40:19] <Hunterkll> yea, that's just wrong
[03:40:23] <Hunterkll> there's a lot of great fixes in v6
[03:40:27] <Hunterkll> nevermind the elimination of NAT 
[03:40:31] <signalblue> that's normal 464XLAT
[03:40:55] <signalblue> elimination of NAT = larger addressing pool
[03:41:19] <Hunterkll> I mean, there's a bunch of encryption stuff thrown on/native, network renumbering ease, tons of stuff that are more than just "oh we have more addresses now"
[03:41:32] <signalblue> better encryption?
[03:41:38] <signofzeta> No more NAT = UPnP can finally die.  Port forwarding dies.
[03:41:43] <signalblue> lol
[03:41:50] <Hunterkll> not better, native
[03:41:50] <signalblue> yeah
[03:41:55] <signofzeta> Not exactly, Hunterkll.  IPsec was made optional in the eleventh hour, but many stacks do support it.
[03:41:59] <signalblue> better than v4 I mwan
[03:42:02] <signalblue> mean*
[03:42:24] <Hunterkll> bit more than that, but either way
[03:42:24] <xe0n> IS IT FRIDAY?!
[03:42:32] <xe0n> no :(
[03:42:33] <signalblue> we're gonna run out of v6 addresses in the future too

[03:51:37] <signalblue> no

[03:51:47] <Hunterkll> oh it's slightly less
[03:51:50] <signalblue> no
[03:51:50] <Hunterkll> signalblue: that's below wholesale
[03:51:55] <signalblue> it's $7.58
[03:51:56] <Hunterkll> they're losing money on that 
[03:52:02] <Hunterkll> yes i get that

[03:52:14] <signalblue> it is less than wholesale
[03:52:23] <signalblue> because CF is AT wholesal
[03:52:24] <signalblue> e
[03:52:33] <Hunterkll> i'm aware of that.....
[03:52:39] <Hunterkll> why do you think i've been transferring everything at renewal? 
[03:52:46] <catbeard> good thing i got out of domains
[03:52:48] <Hunterkll> even though my namecheap pricing discount level has me at below $9/domain for .com's 
[03:52:48] <signalblue> verisign is raising prices
[03:52:49] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:52:58] <signalblue> namecheap is too expensive lol
[03:53:00] <catbeard> you should transfer at least a week or two before renewal
[03:53:05] <Hunterkll> signalblue: not when you have 100 domains in your account
[03:53:06] <Hunterkll> ;)
[03:53:07] <catbeard> so you transfer includes the renewal
[03:53:07] <signalblue> $13 on renewal
[03:53:15] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> $30 AUD cheaper than google domains

[03:53:15] <Hunterkll> signalblue: yea i pay less than $9 for renewal 
[03:53:16] <catbeard> at another registrar
[03:53:25] <Hunterkll> signalblue: load up 100 xyz domains and talk to support about a discount LOL
[03:53:35] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: no one is allowed to issue an SHA-1 certificate anymore.  If Microsoft has a CA, they could lose it for doing that, even though it's explicitly for backwards compatibility.  So, tough.
[03:53:38] <catbeard> most are already selling it at a discount
[03:53:43] <signalblue> porkbun doesn't really do discount pricing because it's like getting a discount on already cheap stuff
[03:53:50] <catbeard> so they don't make a lot on it
[03:53:51] <Hunterkll> signalblue: 'if'
[03:53:52] <catbeard> unless they are premium tlds
[03:53:56] <Hunterkll> er, signalblue 'if'
[03:54:01] <Hunterkll> fucking
[03:54:03] <signalblue> what?
[03:54:11] <Hunterkll> my habit of typing 4 letters then autocompleting 
[03:54:13] <xe0n> i went to bed and you were talking about domains and junk, i come back 10 hrs later and you're still talking about it
[03:54:13] <Hunterkll> is biting me
[03:54:14] <signalblue> having a stroke there?
[03:54:23] <Hunterkll> i have to go to five letters to get to signofzeta 
[03:54:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:54:26] <signalblue> xe0n: yep
[03:54:38] <catbeard> mfw Hunterkll triggers Sigyn
[03:54:44] <xe0n> yeah probably
[03:54:50] <signofzeta> yeah, my bad.  Once COVID is over, signalblue and I will have to fight for our usernames.
[03:54:50] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: it's not just the cert, it's communications traffic 
[03:54:54] <catbeard> i guess that's ozone here
[03:55:08] <signalblue> LOL
[03:55:19] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: I can get it to trust a sha-2 cert just fine in browser and agents 
[03:55:34] <catbeard> question is can you get a user to
[03:56:43] <Hunterkll> but i've got a really shitty php script that acts as a fake WSUS to translate for me so it's all good
[03:56:45] <catbeard> so heh, if you lock Core Isolation on, the user can't launch virtualbox, even if they want to
[03:57:52] <catbeard> @SmellySalad, this probably isn't surprising but ResellerClub is owned by EIG
[03:58:59] <catbeard> when their API isn't available (which is ip restricted)
[03:59:06] <catbeard> they're like oh .. well .. that sucks
[04:00:06] <catbeard> i had to make the api call iterative and process the lookups in chunks that fit the limits to avoid going over the API ratelimit during a surge of domain availability lookups
[04:00:54] <catbeard> what with like 100+ different tlds in different status, e.g. some lookups are only searchable via their premium domain api lookup
[04:01:28] <catbeard> so you had to do the string mangling and figure out if it _was_ a premium tld before using the request, otherwise it would just claim ignorance, return a 200 OK success json request but empty
[04:01:31] <catbeard> like.. wtf

[04:06:45] <Hunterkll> Enforce message signing in the host's configuration. On Windows, this is found in the policy setting 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)'. On Samba, the setting is called 'server signing'. See the 'see also' links for further details.

[04:27:33] <catbeard> corn266: the basics of that is
[04:27:38] <catbeard> The printable ascii shellcode character space consists within 3 main ranges, while symbols exist between them:
[04:27:40] <catbeard>     Lowercase alpha falls between 0x61 and 0x7a (a-z).
[04:27:42] <catbeard>     Uppercase alpha falls between 0x41 and 0x5a (A-Z).
[04:27:44] <catbeard>     Numeric space falls between 0x30 and 0x39 (0-9).
[04:28:10] <corn266> i don't speak your hex code
[04:28:16] <catbeard> and there are NOP pairs that get detected
[04:28:19] <catbeard> that's okay
[04:28:32] <corn266> 65 and 90 whatever
[04:28:40] <catbeard> it can be written as ascii

[09:36:43] <Hunterkll> only manual intervention i had to do was re-set the static IPs and clear the ntds databse logs out

[11:18:18] <nobyk> am exited
[11:18:29] <xe0n> meh its not that much different
[11:18:34] <xe0n> i dont even notice im running it lol
[11:18:49] <nobyk> did you change the taskbar?
[11:18:53] <nobyk> So it looks like windows 10
[11:18:55] <xe0n> no?
[11:19:06] <Activ8> nobyk windows 11 is just windows 10 with a new taskbar lol
[11:19:07] <nobyk> cool
[11:19:14] <xe0n> i did align it to the left though
[11:19:15] <xe0n> lol
[11:19:35] <nobyk> .. so it's not in the center?
[11:19:43] <nobyk> But to the left, like in windows 10? :D
[11:19:45] <xe0n> centre by default, i moved it to the left
[11:20:09] <Activ8> Lmao so you just moved to a windows 10 theme then
[11:20:16] <nobyk> fuck you guys I'm exited about it
[11:20:20] <xe0n> what?
[11:20:27] <nobyk> I'm gonna be snapping windows all day every day
[11:20:28] <xe0n> its windows 11 theme....but the button is on the left/

[11:20:54] <xe0n> lol
[11:20:57] <Activ8> windows 11 is just a new task bar so really it’s windows 10 with a new taskbar
[11:21:03] <xe0n> its more but sure
[11:21:22] <xe0n> update process is improved
[11:21:31] <Activ8> i hope it’s more secure that’s for sure lol
[11:21:42] <xe0n> errr sure? its windows...
[11:21:43] <xe0n> lol
[11:21:58] <xe0n> as in...whatever right? whatevers happening in 10 is happening in 11
[11:22:00] <Activ8> ballocks another year of security problems then
[11:22:00] <xe0n> and maybe more
[11:22:03] <xe0n> otherwise, its same old windows y0
[11:23:06] <Activ8> We should be allowed a windows 2000/server 2003 theme with the security of windows 11.
[11:24:01] <xe0n> errr no thanks
[11:24:15] <xe0n> i like the new start menu...my apps are just....there

[11:24:23] <xe0n> lol
[11:26:45] <Activ8> Or maybe let’s get rid of the start menu for a windows 3.1 theme lol

[11:27:05] <xe0n> yeah nah

[12:29:53] <Hunterkll> no

[12:31:31] <Hunterkll> even 7th gen is gonna see a 5-10% slowdown on the CPU side unless it's like, X-series which was released on later revisions

[12:32:18] <xe0n> beta channel is going to 11, dev channel is going to experimental builds
[12:32:22] <Hunterkll> CptLuxx: yea, i don't think they want to publicly talk about things like HVCI and shit to fuel conspiracy theories 
[12:32:22] <xe0n> which may never go to GA
[12:32:29] <xe0n> (which they warned about last week)
[12:32:56] <Hunterkll> CptLuxx: current systems that got it without being able to light up these features were for testing/figuring out which actually works 
[12:33:05] <Hunterkll> also - AMD is notorious for dumb shit in microcode/firmware
[12:33:12] <xe0n> IMPORTANT REMINDER: If you are in the Dev Channel, now would be the right time to consider switching to the Beta Channel if you want to stay on more stabilized builds of Windows 11. 
[12:33:37] <sd> 13<C​olour> Thanks!
[12:33:40] <Hunterkll> ask A-KO how long it took to get his "new" (now ~2 years old?) AMD build stable because of dumb ass AMD bugs 
[12:34:05] <BWMerlin> xe0n: you know me xe0n push to production
[12:34:08] <Hunterkll> obviously you won't see shit like that in defined configs, but lol
[12:34:13] <xe0n> i hope you've installed the kb i said ^
[12:34:14] <xe0n> lol
[12:34:38] <BWMerlin> What KB?
[12:34:43] <Joe_Developer> morning nerds
[12:34:44] <Hunterkll> CptLuxx: a lot of what they're pushing involves using under the hood hypervisors and a lot of other shit 
[12:34:48] <xe0n> https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-26-2021-public-preview-update-kb5005104-36708554-9d62-4170-bf95-c3abf7efd9e4
[12:34:52] <xe0n> fixes lots of things
[12:34:54] <CptLuxx> annoying that they just say it
[12:34:56] <CptLuxx> ......
[12:34:57] <Hunterkll> CptLuxx: nevermind specific UEFI functions 
[12:35:23] <Hunterkll> if you don't have them, you can light the features up on win10 and get the hit now, and the same issues 
[12:35:49] <BWMerlin> I wish I was running HCI, I don't even have hyper-v (or any other VM) with failover
[12:35:49] <Hunterkll> Win10's a security posture rebase 
[12:35:58] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: HVCI  - not HCI 
[12:36:05] <Hunterkll> hypervisor code integrity 
[12:36:10] <Hunterkll> not hyperconverged infra 
[12:36:32] <BWMerlin> Says Azure Stack HCI at the top
[12:36:43] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: applies to server 2022 as well
[12:36:52] <xe0n> yeah they're pushing that for containers, hyper-v etc etc
[12:36:56] <xe0n> since hyper-v server is dead
[12:37:04] <Hunterkll> shame
[12:37:06] <xe0n> anddd SAC builds are dead
[12:37:15] <BWMerlin> SAC?
[12:37:17] <Hunterkll> xe0n: you saw they're not even gonna work on fuckin' shielded VMs anymore?
[12:37:21] <Hunterkll> they want that fuckin sub money
[12:37:21] <xe0n> yep
[12:37:34] <xe0n> all the effort for hypervisor pretty much moving forward is HCI lol
[12:37:39] <Hunterkll> yea
[12:37:52] <xe0n> BWMerlin: semi-annual channel
[12:38:08] <Hunterkll> xe0n: it's gonna be vmware or openstack in house dev for us now i guess for anything beyond regular VM shit 
[12:38:18] <xe0n> yeah we're vmware so lol
[12:38:26] <xe0n> i think my boxes here still run 2016 lol
[12:38:28] <BWMerlin> I never used hyper-v server, is it much different to windows server with hyper-v?
[12:38:29] <xe0n> meh they work
[12:38:30] <Hunterkll> watch them yank system center out from u nder me 
[12:38:41] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: it's just a windows server core with no extra features but hyper-v 
[12:38:45] <xe0n> its the hyper-v role minus some of the bigger features
[12:38:45] <Hunterkll> and was 100% free
[12:39:08] <Hunterkll> it was their answer to free esxi, basically
[12:39:43] <BWMerlin> I wonder if it will have a big impact
[12:39:48] <Hunterkll> hopefully partner pushback can correct this path like it did the last one 
[12:39:49] <Hunterkll> but damn 
[12:39:54] <Hunterkll> they really shot themselves in the foot
[12:40:18] <xe0n> impact wont be _that_ big, its still supported till 2029
[12:40:31] <Hunterkll> oh, all the features are supported in 2022 
[12:40:39] <Hunterkll> so upgrading to 2022 just buys you more time
[12:40:50] <BWMerlin> Would be interesting to know how many peopled used it vs how many people use windows server with hyper-v
[12:40:50] <Hunterkll> oh, you mean hyper-v server
[12:40:52] <xe0n> what i was referring to was the hyper-v server 2019 sku
[12:40:53] <xe0n> haha
[12:40:57] <xe0n> which ends support 2029
[12:41:00] <Hunterkll> yea
[12:41:05] <Hunterkll> 2022 buys us time, that's it 
[12:41:28] <BWMerlin> Would hyper-v server saved much in licensing?
[12:41:28] <Hunterkll> bastards going "yea, we're not gonna develop shielded VMs and shit " after 2016 and 2019 were major pushes for it
[12:41:30] <Hunterkll> fuck 'em 
[12:41:30] <xe0n> no
[12:41:39] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: if you were not running windows guests, then yes
[12:41:47] <Hunterkll> you still have to license your guest VMs 
[12:42:06] <Hunterkll> but hyper-v server was a free hypervisor, relying on you to license your guest OS instances - whatever they are
[12:42:11] <BWMerlin> You only need to license windows guest right?
[12:42:26] <xe0n> yes
[12:42:32] <Hunterkll> the hyper-v host (server or hyper-v server - no matter how you got to hyper-v) doesn't care about licensing 
[12:42:41] <Hunterkll> it's just a raw decent hypervisor
[12:42:49] <BWMerlin> That was my understanding
[12:42:54] <sd> 13<C​olour> Luv hyperv
[12:42:59] <sd> 13<C​olour> Nuff said
[12:43:05] <BWMerlin> So how many people were running hyper-v server with none windows guests?
[12:43:11] <Hunterkll> <
[12:43:12] <xe0n> i dunno, ask google?
[12:43:13] <xe0n> lol
[12:43:44] <BWMerlin> I would think that would be a small number as I would imagine those users would be much more inclined to go with a linux VM server 
[12:43:45] <sd> 13<C​olour> Can domain join it? Google timr
[12:44:03] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: sure, if you didn't want vCPU density or local storage performance.....
[12:44:15] <Hunterkll> Hyper-V excells in those areas 
[12:44:44] <Hunterkll> xe0n: oh what if - they release hyper-v with all the work they did as making it dom0 - so free hyper-v is linux host OS
[12:44:45] <Hunterkll> LOL
[12:44:54] <xe0n> lol
[12:45:02] <Hunterkll> i mean
[12:45:09] <xe0n> im not really fussed lol
[12:45:14] <Hunterkll> they submitted how many patches and lines of code for making the linux kernel the control OS?
[12:45:38] <Hunterkll> xe0n: me either tbh - since we're licensed, it's just sad they're putting shielded VMs on maint mode without subscription payments
[12:45:48] <Hunterkll> all my hyper-v boxes have at least a standard license
[12:45:57] <sd> 13<C​olour> Hate subscription

[12:47:05] <bagpuss_thecat> ... than the 0.2% that did crash of those that met min requirements
[12:47:07] <Hunterkll> that's something i should probably ask our TAM since it's probably been addressed 
[12:47:23] <Hunterkll> bagpuss_thecat: my system crashes and submits reports due to firmware bugs
[12:47:26] <Hunterkll> i'm part of those numbers
[12:48:00] <Hunterkll> bagpuss_thecat: the numbers that meet the min reqs, anyway
[12:48:17] <BWMerlin> I think I will skip Windows 11 at home, I don't need Windows for what I do and can always VM it for the little bit of PowerShell work I do
[12:48:23] <Hunterkll> I fixed my desktop, can't fix my laptop 
[12:48:37] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: W11 is much better IMO right now 
[12:48:48] <sd> 13<C​olour> Subscription should only charge if you actually use the thing
[12:49:01] <Hunterkll> @Colour If you're running an exchange server - you're using it

[12:50:27] <sd> 13<C​olour> 500/750 should you be charged for those 250 you don't use
[12:50:37] <Hunterkll> bagpuss_thecat: they're pretty upfront about this one
[12:50:58] <bagpuss_thecat> 0.2% crashed. the other group had 52% more
[12:51:02] <Hunterkll> bagpuss_thecat: their emulation code for the features they want supported in hardware isn't up to scratch, and when it is, it shoots you to an up to 40% performance loss 
[12:51:05] <BWMerlin> I would like to say Arch for the ePeen but probably ubuntu
[12:51:13] <Hunterkll> a 40% performance loss will invoke crashes left and right 
[12:51:17] <bagpuss_thecat> crashes, not performance changes
[12:51:23] <csws> BWMerlin, if you want the epeen with less pain, manjaro is prett ygood
[12:51:36] <Hunterkll> bagpuss_thecat: yes, and performance degredation can result in nasty thi ng likes deadlocks etc
[12:51:42] <bagpuss_thecat> true
[12:51:59] <Hunterkll> they *want* to rely on hardware features 
[12:52:05] <bagpuss_thecat> and rightly so
[12:52:08] <Hunterkll> Win10 had them as both hardware and software
[12:52:20] <Hunterkll> you can install current win10 and light up all the features
[12:52:23] <Hunterkll> and see what happens
[12:52:37] <Hunterkll> bagpuss_thecat: HVCI is a fun one - virtualizing/isolating drivers and processes, etc 
[12:52:43] <Hunterkll> that's a major one
[12:52:58] <Hunterkll> if you're not on an 8th gen intel or 2nd gen ryzen, you're looking at degredation, at the least
[12:53:30] <BWMerlin> My rig is 7 years old, served me well.  Super stable but slower than I want
[12:53:34] <bagpuss_thecat> I think they need to be less weasely with their words then. Don't invert the numbers and draw comparisons in two neighbouring sentences
[12:53:56] <Activ8> anyone from australia in here
[12:54:07] <csws> yeah
[12:54:30] <Activ8> can any Australians comment on the zero bank balance glitch?  check your bank now you have 0 funds in your bank
[12:54:53] <csws> BWMerlin, yeah I have a 4790k system and it's working great. was only unstable when I had the 4.3 GHz all core OC

[12:55:38] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: yep, and you won't get the upgrade offered, but you'll get an EOL notice like XP did 
[12:55:42] <BWMerlin> Mine is fine
[12:55:42] <Hunterkll> in a few years
[12:56:18] <Hunterkll> i think people are seriously overblowing it - machine breakage / upgrades / etc will cover most of it

[12:59:04] <Hunterkll> a LOT of mobo vendors have launched updates adding that module
[12:59:26] <Hunterkll> @Colour they have an other ~3-4 years to update machines as they break

[13:07:52] <Hunterkll> and the only reason XP lasted so long was because of Vista's ship delays

[13:13:33] <Hunterkll> @Colour Win8 was the first version of windows that didn't rely on traditional bios (on x86!!!) to be able to boot and function
[13:13:58] <Hunterkll> before Win8, even on a UEFI machine that wasn't Itanium based, you had to have bios emulation turned on for Win7 to w ork

[15:36:01] <xe0n> but it was oems going hey ms we need your help selling pcs, what can we do
[15:36:16] <xe0n> you know internally at ms the windows team had a re-organisation?
[15:36:20] <xe0n> so things are changing internally
[15:36:22] <thegodsquirrel> I mean if it forces that guy with the AST with 2 GB of RAM and an ancient Athlon to upgrade.....
[15:36:26] <xe0n> i.e. making windows relevant again, etc
[15:36:35] <estranger> msft don't care about windows as much anymore
[15:36:40] <xe0n> yes they do!
[15:36:40] <xe0n> lol
[15:37:00] <thegodsquirrel> "We can't reboot it, because it takes 2 hours to come back..."
[15:37:07] <xe0n> anyway...
[15:37:15] <xe0n> plenty of info out there re: whats happening internally
[15:37:16] <sd> 09<H​aise> thegodsquirrel: I am stuck with i7 7th gen and i5 6th gen :P
[15:37:29] <Mark_Pinecone> I use linux desktop mainly, windows pc is only for AD stuff and most of times i use WSL on it :D
[15:37:30] <xe0n> podcasts with journalists who deal with ms for a living are good tidbits
[15:37:36] <xe0n> each have their own sources inside the company etc
[15:37:43] <nobyk> estranger: they just made a new version wdym
[15:37:49] <thegodsquirrel> Tell us about your ancient ways! Haise
[15:38:07] <xe0n> let's be real...there's going to be some sort of patch\script\whatever to enable the features
[15:38:09] <xe0n> just give it a week
[15:38:10] <xe0n> lol
[15:38:14] <estranger> they are all about azure it seems to me.. some regions give no sales commission unless the rep hits their azure goal
[15:38:16] * thegodsquirrel sits here with an original i7 MBP
[15:38:28] <xe0n> ofc they're about azure
[15:38:39] <xe0n> but they do care about windows, just look at the new windows desktop stuff
[15:38:41] <xe0n> windows 365
[15:38:43] <xe0n> they want windows on ANY device
[15:38:44] <sd> 09<H​aise> xe0n: didn't they say if you don't run supported CPU, perf will get smited for 40% ?
[15:39:08] <xe0n> i dunno about the performance hit tbh, unsupported is unsupported, i dont plan to run it on hardware that isnt supported
[15:39:10] <xe0n> ie this machine
[15:39:10] <xe0n> lol
[15:39:15] <thegodsquirrel> I want Windows on a Chromebook for $100/ month
[15:39:20] <xe0n> it'll stay on insider till i buy a new pc
[15:39:21] <estranger> windows is still the only good Enterprise desktop os imo
[15:39:25] <thegodsquirrel> Said no one ever...
[15:39:26] <sd> 09<H​aise> xe0n: upgrade time or roll with Win 10 till EoL ?

[15:43:20] <Church> I just take the standard
[15:43:34] <estranger> same, even with a house
[15:43:58] <estranger> the married standard deduction is so damn high anymore
[15:44:32] <Church> Heh won't get that for a while

[15:48:14] <xe0n> ++
[15:48:26] <xe0n> im getting slogged a levy for not having private health cover
[15:48:30] <xe0n> i prob should sort it by the next one
[15:48:32] <xe0n> its like 1500 odd
[15:48:33] <xe0n> lol
[15:48:48] <estranger> I dunno where the A fits in for ACA
[15:48:57] <estranger> premiums are bonkers
[15:49:21] <estranger> xe0n get a MSA plan!
[15:49:32] <xe0n> m..s..a
[15:49:38] <xe0n> ?
[15:49:39] <estranger> low premium, great tax benefits... if you are healthy
[15:49:44] <xe0n> I AM HEALTHY
[15:49:48] <estranger> medical savings account
[15:49:53] <xe0n> are those a thing in aus
[15:49:56] <xe0n> someone else confirm
[15:49:56] <xe0n> LOL
[15:49:58] <estranger> oh
[15:50:19] <xe0n> medical savings account...as in like...a bank account used for medical stuff?
[15:50:28] <xe0n> medical stuff is covered here pretty much lol!, private health insurrance
[15:50:34] <estranger> dunno! sorry I made assumptions when you said you got hit for not having coverage
[15:50:47] <xe0n> YOU ARE LIKE A SALES PERSON
[15:50:49] <xe0n> WANT MY MONEY!!!
[15:50:52] <xe0n> and my kafka
[15:50:54] <xe0n> you can have that
[15:51:29] <estranger> MSA is a plan with no coverage until you hit your deductible which is higher, but you can put money into an account tax free to pay for medical stuff
[15:51:38] <estranger> it's tax free in and out
[15:51:43] <xe0n> mmmm
[15:51:46] <xe0n> dunno if those a thing here
[15:51:49] <xe0n> SOMEONE CONFIRM
[15:51:56] <xe0n> lol
[15:51:56] <estranger> and employers often match what you put in
[15:52:00] <xe0n> oh no
[15:52:03] <xe0n> they pay super y0
[15:52:07] <xe0n> and my tax
[15:52:15] <xe0n> maybe some companies offer private health tbh
[15:52:16] <xe0n> mine dont
[15:52:16] <xe0n> LOL
[15:52:27] <estranger> idea is you start it when young and build up a nice account to pay for shit when you need it
[15:52:42] <estranger> USA healthcare is... weird
[15:53:03] <Church> I mean it's meant as more of a tax loophole really tbh
[15:53:08] <Church> So, nice if you're rich
[15:53:11] <estranger> my employer pays 100% of my premium and 85% of my dependents

[16:25:17] <misspwn> FUCK THEM
[16:25:18] <xe0n> nooo
[16:25:28] <misspwn> because then it'll sit stagnant for two weeks
[16:25:31] <xe0n> put comments in the thing, send them a note, if i dont hear from you in X im closing the ticket
[16:25:35] <xe0n> you'll get the thanks
[16:25:36] <xe0n> wait...
[16:25:37] <xe0n> close
[16:25:41] <xe0n> nooo
[16:26:10] <rpifan> xe0n, use mp3s
[16:26:11] <misspwn> we have auto processes in place that will auto close something into like pending closure but then you don't get credit for it if it does that. but if i can't say if i don't hear from you in x days
[16:26:55] <misspwn> and a re-opened % goes against your metrics so i just re-open the tasks and say eat a dix
[16:27:12] <misspwn> (i don't really say that but i'm thinkin it)
[16:27:32] <rpifan> metrics?
[16:27:35] <rpifan> thats horrible
[16:27:47] <misspwn> yeah well that's what an MSP does
[16:28:09] <xe0n> https://youtu.be/49RHVdxsEUU?t=2545
[16:28:10] <misspwn> but i usually hit all 5 every week which puts like $125 extra in my paycheck
[16:28:25] <xe0n> the cdjs dont support mp3 lol, they're model below, only audio cd
[16:28:30] <rpifan> i wold not work at a job where my performance is based on 'metrics'
[16:28:35] <rpifan> i see
[16:29:05] <misspwn> everyone is based on metrics at any job. i'm not getting punished if i don't exceed them
[16:29:09] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm THE sysadmin. I don't care about my metrics. I can make any metrics I want. It's just annoying having to open a ticket just to close it again
[16:29:33] <rpifan> yea i hate metrics
[16:29:40] <rpifan> if you want a robot then build one yourself
[16:29:40] * misspwn re-opens teh_f4ll3n 's ticket "I TOLD YOU THAT MY LEFT HANDED MOUSE HASN'T WORKED IN MONTHS"

[16:30:35] <teh_f4ll3n> delete tickets where clientname like "%misspwn%"
[16:30:48] <rpifan> nice
[16:30:59] <misspwn> hahahah
[16:31:18] <misspwn> hey rpifan i'm over here using that extra bonus monies for my car payment
[16:31:19] <teh_f4ll3n> "sorry, I can't find your tickets"
[16:32:02] <rpifan> money is bad to begin with and even worse to be rewarded with it for 'compliance' to the 'metrics'
[16:32:04] <misspwn> wonder about actual MSPs if there are folks that are truly lifers because they love where they work or what
[16:32:14] <rpifan> this is what usually upsets people when i meet them
[16:32:17] <misspwn> also i agree with you
[16:32:30] <rpifan> my disinterest in complying with social norms of this nature and tahts when they go to someone else more normal
[16:32:36] <misspwn> the reasons why an MSP has that is for billing purpose
[16:32:36] <rpifan> and i go back ot drinking the vodka on the counter
[16:32:48] <misspwn> they have to track more on what is spent where
[16:33:03] <misspwn> and i'm pretty sure everyone fudges their time sheets
[16:33:12] <rpifan> time sheets?
[16:33:13] <rpifan> what no
[16:33:19] <rpifan> how detailed you need to be
[16:33:35] <rpifan> i once interviewed at a german job where you needed to break down all your work in 15 minute increments
[16:33:38] <misspwn> well when you close a ticket with notes it stamps when you start/stop or if you dedutct and that goes on your time sheet of daily tasks
[16:33:40] <rpifan> i laughed at them and left
[16:33:51] <misspwn> welp guess that's where i'm at then hahha
[16:34:17] <misspwn> i mean yesterday i spent an hour and a half on something i dont even care i just log my time and write out what i did. but i'm also a high tier person 
[16:34:33] <rpifan> you should be CTO misspwn 
[16:34:41] <rpifan> women are usually the best bosses
[16:34:58] <misspwn> i'd probably be an aight boss
[16:35:18] <misspwn> it would have to be a different company though maybe a non profit or something
[16:35:19] <rpifan> there is something really different about being socialized to be socially sensitive
[16:35:39] <rpifan> ill always remmeber what my psychologist told me, women are socialized to be social connectors 
[16:35:41] <misspwn> work life balance is important to me and i wana get that back
[16:35:58] <rpifan> so their approach to life will always be different then men
[16:36:08] <misspwn> maybe, some are still jerks though
[16:36:13] <rpifan> its a lot easier to tell a woman boss, im really deprseed and need help versus a man boss
[16:36:16] <misspwn> like if you are in HR, you're a dumb jerk
[16:36:27] <rpifan> well yes sadly most HR women are useless horrible people
[16:36:40] <rpifan> thinking about it, i havent meet many HR men
[16:36:50] <misspwn> uh same actually
[16:36:58] <rpifan> and thats counting the fact that gay men often do typical women jobs
[16:37:25] <rpifan> i did know one gay but he was the front office admin
[16:37:26] <misspwn> have seen like receptionist type gigs/admin gigs like that where men have done those roles but not HR
[16:37:27] <rpifan> and not really HR
[16:37:52] <rpifan> thats a really good point, its usually women and jerks at that
[16:38:04] <rpifan> im sure there is some social reason for that
[16:38:19] <rpifan> none the less women in tech tend to be much better off
[16:38:45] <rpifan> but i do understand there often social pressures for women to adopt more stereotypical masculine behaviors to be taken seriously
[16:39:16] <misspwn> yeah thinkin bout gettin out of tech and goin to welding
[16:39:27] <misspwn> again not really a job where the ladies hang
[16:39:55] <Mark_Pinecone> Guys do you manage kubernetes clusters as sysadmins?  
[16:39:56] <misspwn> at the very least i'd like to start taking some night classes to refresh my skills with fire and metal
[16:40:21] <rpifan> well it was full of women during WWII and in the soviet union / east germany
[16:40:33] <misspwn> Mark_Pinecone, nah we stay away from most open source stuff

[16:45:12] <sintax> misspwn: weird. 
[16:45:13] <rpifan> also this whole thing of lunch vs dinner is interesting
[16:45:25] <sintax> and of course the IT Dir and other sys admin aren't on yet
[16:45:27] <rpifan> in south america lunch is a heavy big meal and dinner is just tea and crackers
[16:45:34] <sintax> yup
[16:45:37] <rpifan> and thats how i personally eat anyway
[16:45:53] <misspwn> yeah but it's hard when others are not like that and you still have to cook something you know you wont be eating
[16:46:16] <misspwn> i would be perfectly fine eating once a day
[16:46:28] <rpifan> thats how my mom was
[16:46:33] <rpifan> but then she got older and was like screw it
[16:46:36] <rpifan> im eating all the cupcakes
[16:46:36] <misspwn> snacking for me just leads to trouble
[16:46:37] <sintax> i usually have oatmeal for breakfast
[16:46:42] <sintax> then a big lunch, light dinner
[16:46:43] <rpifan> then she got fatter and she was like ok no more cupcakes
[16:46:53] <misspwn> breaking my "fast" too early will make me hungrier for some reason
[16:47:06] <rpifan> well i avoid breakfast by sleeping until past noon and going direct for lunch
[16:47:08] <sintax> but there's some days i just eat everything and other days where i don't 
[16:47:13] <rpifan> unless i have somethign to do early in the day
[16:47:24] <sintax> rpifan: so you're nocturnal. got it :)
[16:47:30] <misspwn> yeah which is perfectly fine
[16:47:31] <rpifan> but this is why my latest job requirement is 100 percent work from home
[16:47:41] <CptLuxx> [14:14:14] <rpifan> so my rent eats basically all of my unemployment
[16:47:43] <CptLuxx> wtf you doing?
[16:47:51] <CptLuxx> the arbeitsamt pays for your rent
[16:47:52] <rpifan> it costs 440 euro for an 8sq meter room
[16:47:59] <rpifan> with ALG 1?
[16:48:02] <CptLuxx> ha
[16:48:05] <estranger> why did you move there again?
[16:48:06] <CptLuxx> your fucked
[16:48:12] <CptLuxx> better call them and request assistence
[16:48:21] <rpifan> estranger, i ask myself that often
[16:48:23] <CptLuxx> alg 2 will pay your rent
[16:48:26] <estranger> lol
[16:48:26] <CptLuxx> and you get 500 or so
[16:48:36] <rpifan> so alg 2 would basically  be the same as alg 1
[16:48:50] <CptLuxx> well
[16:48:54] <CptLuxx> alg2 pays your rent
[16:48:59] <CptLuxx> and other stuff..
[16:49:08] <CptLuxx> and then you get 400-500 for everything else
[16:49:15] <rpifan> my understand is that i need to run down ALG 1 first
[16:49:19] <rpifan> before i can try alg 2
[16:49:40] <CptLuxx> tell them alg1 is not enough
[16:49:41] <rpifan> theyve given me 300 days of ALG 1
[16:49:45] <CptLuxx> they can switch you normaly..
[16:49:51] <rpifan> will they give me more money CptLuxx ?

[21:02:05] <saturntho> guess ill try uninstalling it , very weird issue though, never seen it before

[21:02:50] <saturntho> yep, tried that as well unfortunately. I don't think it's a chrome issue since when the issue occurs, multiple different applications wont open
[21:03:26] <saturntho> also when the issue occurs, the computer isn't able to restart, it just gets stuck on the restarting screen.. if this user wasn't remote I would've just wiped this machine tbh
