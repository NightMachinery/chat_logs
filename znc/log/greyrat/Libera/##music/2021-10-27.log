[09:30:53] <Panther> I am reading Ourder in Chaos finally.
[09:30:58] <Panther> Order, too
[09:30:59] * murthy believes that each person is a collection of people
[09:31:22] <murthy> Panther: oh. Sweet dreams
[09:31:37] <murthy> artao: I am getting tired of this lame excuse
[09:31:38] <Panther> Well, I am not even one.. if there were a collectiion, then I demand rent.
[09:31:53] <murthy> :D
[09:32:04] <artao> lame excuse?
[09:32:09] <artao> for a butt?
[09:32:16] <artao> you're getting rid of your butt?
[09:32:19] <artao> :O
[09:32:25] <murthy> artao: ya get your clock straight buddy
[09:33:07] <murthy> Butt is a nice music streaming application, why would someone want to get rid of it. Pfft
[09:33:11] <artao> clock?
[09:33:14] <artao> straight?
[09:33:28] <artao> the?
[09:33:33] <murthy> artao: It's called circadian rhythm
[09:33:37] <Panther> This book was $80, but the General of Panzer Troops Hermann Balck is a fascinating character.. very intelligent and observant.
[09:33:54] <Panther> I can see why Dyson liked him.
[09:34:30] <murthy> artao: wake up one hour before sun rise time at your place and go to bed 16 hrs after it
[09:35:17] <Panther> He's about to hit Greece soon.
[09:35:31] * Panther just popped a pill.
[09:35:35] <murthy> Which Dyson who? The vaccum cleaner guy or the Dyson sphere guy?
[09:35:43] <Panther> 0.25mg triazolam
[09:36:07] <Panther> Freeman Dyson
[09:36:23] <Panther> Who wrote Weapons and Hope, which I also have :)
[09:36:48] <murthy> I tell you the slave labours have no problem falling sleep here. They sleep wherever and whenever they find break
[09:36:55] <murthy> Oh ok
[09:37:54] <murthy> artao: wanted to ask you if you go the tetanus injection for those cat bites
[09:38:37] <artao> no. didn't need one. i'm current
[09:39:01] <murthy> Surface lacerations or deep bites?
[09:39:15] <artao> tooth punctures
[09:39:23] <artao> they're healing well
[09:39:23] <murthy> Oof
[09:39:51] <Panther> No massive loss of flesh and blood with major internal organ damage?
[09:39:54] <murthy> I have known that cats do love bites. But this is bad
[09:40:11] <artao> just my knee kidney Panther. no biggie
[09:40:16] <artao> i've got 7 more
[09:40:26] <Panther> Just kidneying around.
[09:40:28] <murthy> Panther: that will happen when did doesn't wake up in time to feed his cats
[09:40:52] <Panther> Feed them kidneys
[09:41:16] <murthy> Those alcohol damaged ones? No thanks
[09:41:26] <artao> https://youtu.be/HXzzXkJZiJU
[09:41:30] <Janet> (REDIRECT) ^ Comparing U.S. vs. Soviet Spacesuits at Smithsonian - YouTube
[09:41:33] <Panther> Why do they have to be damaged?
[09:42:11] <Panther> They have machines that mechanically dispense cat food at intervals, so they stay fed all the time.
[09:42:37] <murthy> What we need to do is train the cats to push all the kitchen vessels and stuff if artao doesn't wake in time
[09:42:51] <artao> i don't have a schedule

[09:43:20] <murthy> OMG
[09:43:23] <artao> kidney pie?
[09:43:32] <murthy> One of the most hilarious ones
[09:43:36] <artao> i've never had it. i imagine it might be a bit bitter
[09:43:41] <artao> almost certainly better than liver tho
[09:43:51] <artao> live is gross. unless it's braunschweiger/liverwurst
[09:43:57] <artao> weird, that

[20:46:50] <murthy> morlog: me too
[20:47:13] <Panther> The idiocy of the Japanese in WW2 is only exceeded by that of the Italians during WW1.
[20:47:19] <morlog> does it cold where you are murthy 
[20:47:31] <Panther> Tho, the Italians were pretty idiotic in WW2, too.
[20:47:31] <nativetexan> mmm..not sure on the cost of heating as houston doesn't use heating much but my highest electric bill this year was $113
[20:47:35] <morlog> think your further south on the globe than me

[20:58:10] <murthy> efex: ty
[20:58:32] <murthy> History is nice
[20:59:07] <Panther> It varies... mostly Europe from roughly 1600-1946.
[20:59:22] <efex> murthy: history is where we are supposed to be able to see what happened as a result of certain things..
[21:00:01] <murthy> Ya and evolution
[21:00:08] <efex> Panther:  general interst then vs a period? ok
[21:00:23] <murthy> I recently saw a movie named "The Dig"
[21:00:29] <murthy> It was very nice
[21:01:12] <murthy> From the movie I came to know about the king and his extremely ornamental belt buckle

[21:10:57] <murthy> LibertyDillo: oh ya, Awesome car
[21:11:00] <Panther> murthy, what are you gonna do when Vishnu comes to kick your ass for saying that?
[21:11:07] <efex> murthy: the helmet is famous.. did you know that the viking discovery of north america was just recently dated to exactly 1021?
[21:11:11] <LibertyDillo> lol Panther
[21:11:22] <LibertyDillo> yeah I saw that efex
[21:11:25] <murthy> LibertyDillo: It's a model of a British one
[21:11:40] <LibertyDillo> right murthy, they say that in the article
[21:12:06] <LibertyDillo> efex, because of a solar storm that happened that year, and tree rings that showed it
[21:12:06] <efex> murthy:  that’s fine, but the name “natural history” in science refers to a differnt thing than “history” all the same
[21:12:20] <murthy> Panther: I am going underground and ask my lawyer to deal with it :D
[21:12:29] <artao> FAAK dontcha hate it when a zit only half pops
[21:12:35] <LibertyDillo> and the logs they used for the buildings in the settlement had the same rings
[21:12:37] <efex> LibertyDillo: yeah! pretty cool. science is amazing.
[21:12:45] <Panther> What if your lawyer is just another of his avatars? :P
[21:12:56] <murthy> efex: oh yes the helmet awesome piece of work
[21:13:03] <Panther> Actually
[21:13:03] <efex> yup
[21:13:05] <LibertyDillo> One of my ancestors, supposedly, Leif Eriksson
[21:13:22] <murthy> Those finding are very interesting, such craftsmenship
[21:13:25] <Panther> I think that is right... lawyers are avatars of Vishnu.
[21:14:10] <Panther> So, you are screwed.
[21:14:17] <murthy> LibertyDillo: nice
[21:14:40] <LibertyDillo> my family same is Ericson
[21:14:47] <murthy> Panther: Then you see me joing Vishnu and become an theist :D
[21:15:00] <Panther> I guess that's how he got the nickname 'Lucky' Leif :)
[21:15:21] <LibertyDillo> Leif The Lucky, son of Eric The Red
[21:15:29] <Panther> heh
[21:15:54] <LibertyDillo> and I'd say it took a bit of luck to cross the Atlantic around the year 1000 in Viking Longboats
[21:16:26] <Panther> Some of those sags have pages and pages of ancestries that go on and on and on about details of who did this when, etc....
[21:16:27] <LibertyDillo> must have been quite a adventure
[21:16:31] <Panther> sagas
[21:17:20] <LibertyDillo> Thats what they were saying about this discovery, that it proves at least two of the Sagas to be historically accurate time-wise
[21:17:42] <murthy> LibertyDillo: have you seen the meme about the Vikings longboat on the moon?
[21:17:46] <LibertyDillo> The Sagas were written around 1200, supposedly
[21:17:52] <LibertyDillo> no lol
[21:18:20] <Panther> I have a few smewhere. and also a few of the Russian Chronicles.
[21:18:41] <LibertyDillo> but for the year 1000, going across the Atlantic in longboats was probably about as challenging as going to the Moon
[21:19:07] <Panther> At least they couldn't fake it with photos :P
[21:19:12] <LibertyDillo> true
[21:19:55] <murthy> :D
[21:20:06] <murthy> Ya Nvidia was not there
[21:20:29] <LibertyDillo> no Photoshop
[21:20:30] <nativetexan> that reminds me, i got the low frame rate on far cry 6 fixed...or the driver update did
[21:20:37] <murthy> But I believe it was not luck. I think it's their courage and determination
[21:20:55] <LibertyDillo> It must have taken quite a bit of both
[21:21:02] <murthy> nativetexan: ya new Nvidia driver

[21:55:02] <Panther> by Floyd?
[21:55:04] <murthy> People go to movies to forget reality. It's called bugging out
[21:55:30] <nativetexan> and/or having a psychotic dream

[21:55:51] <murthy> Panther: I might have. Title seems familiar but I am not sure
