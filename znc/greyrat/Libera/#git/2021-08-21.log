[01:33:34] <jast> in fact there is a 100% safe way that makes your commit history look a little more cluttered
[01:33:46] <jast> but since your branch is private enough we can use the clean way instead

[01:34:07] <jast> and then it's just "git rebase master"
[01:34:45] <jast> since this rewrites your local commit(s), you'll have to use "git push --force" to overwrite the stuff you've already pushed
[01:34:59] <thiago> it usually doesn't matter the branch point of a feature commit, if you don't need what happened since that point
[01:35:19] <jast> yeah, that's another thing to keep in mind - merges usually work fine even if you branched off a little early
[01:35:19] <thiago> but yeah, you can force-push your feature branch with a rebased master
[01:35:37] <jast> but if you want to test the branch with all of the newest stuff from master before merging, this is probably the best way

[10:39:27] <ross> hi all, made a stupid mistake. in a merge conflict, resolved the conflict, but didn't add the file to mark it as resolved. then I forgot I was in a conflict and kept editing. I haven't committed anything - how can I add just the changes that were relevant to the merge and mark it as resolved, but keep other changes for the next commit?

[10:40:33] <ross> git add --patch would be my go-to, but git wants to ignore the unmerged file, and I'm unconfident re forcing it - maybe git knows better than I do

[11:42:44] <aminvakil> hello, i have a repository with multiple branches which different configurations for building an application with custom configurations are in it
[11:43:18] <aminvakil> i mean some files differ from each other on different branch based on that branch needs and configurations
[11:43:55] <aminvakil> but i've read and heard before that you should always reach a single "main" or "devel" branch and having multiple branches which all goes their ways are wrong
[11:44:34] <ikke> aminvakil: it's not wrong persee, but the issue is that you probably also want to get common updates to these branches
[11:44:40] <aminvakil> handling them in a single branch are hard now, as it's working correctly and each branch is getting built using jenkins just fine
[11:45:05] <aminvakil> ikke: exactly, there are some tweaks which apply to all branches, right now i'm cherry-picking the commit across all branches and that is getting hard too :)

[11:45:53] <ikke> git has no easy way to handle that workflow
[11:46:50] <ikke> You could rebase each branch onto a common branch, but that means that the different branches are constantly changing
[11:46:53] <aminvakil> my question is what other problems i will face handling this in multiple branches and not merging them to a single main branch?

[11:50:26] <ikke> You could technically do something with merge drivers, but that's kinda iffy, and everyone needs to have this diff driver setup

[19:53:20] <TJ-> muhblockchain: 'database' infers keys and multiple tables; CSV is single table. whatever DBMS you use would need to write tables and indexes as multiple text files

[19:53:56] <mackerman> Database doesn't mean keys or tables or indexes.
[19:54:37] <cbreak> you could use a bunch of xml files

[21:18:08] <muhblockchain> *git-friendly
[21:19:20] <muhblockchain> normies on various channels recommend to save DB in default binary format and throw that into git :-/
[21:19:45] <cbreak> only do that if you want bloated history, or never change the contents
[21:19:54] <muhblockchain> ikr?  so what format to use
[21:20:02] <cbreak> you could use git lfs...
[21:20:07] <cbreak> (I wouldn't recommend it)
[21:20:18] <muhblockchain> don't tell me nothing like that exists and I have to invent this
[21:20:31] <cbreak> muhblockchain: you could use csv or xml, or some other text format.
[21:20:39] <cbreak> but no sane database uses a text format
[21:20:46] <muhblockchain> I use csv - and editor is libreoffice for example
[21:20:47] <cbreak> because those are shit to work with performantly.
[21:20:59] <muhblockchain> is there any editor for some kind of format based on xml or json?
[21:21:07] <cbreak> you'd basically have to keep the whole thing in memory to even know what's where.
[21:21:27] <muhblockchain> cbreak: text storage doesn't preclude you from keeping an .index/ dir there
[21:21:35] <cbreak> it does.
[21:21:44] <cbreak> because nothing forces those to be in sync.
[21:22:04] <muhblockchain> the editor
[21:22:10] <muhblockchain> check .index modtime
[21:22:16] <muhblockchain> in case of manual edit
[21:22:28] <cbreak> git doesn't preserve mod time.
[21:22:44] <muhblockchain> well, re-sync data logically after merge
[21:22:55] <muhblockchain> it's for medium-small datasets, obviously
[21:23:14] <muhblockchain> keeping entire db in memory is fine, entire DB would be like 1-10 MB
[21:23:36] <cbreak> maybe sqlite can do that for you...
[21:23:59] <cbreak> or some weirdo-database like those "key value databases" (glorified std::map)
[21:27:04] <muhblockchain> C++ users "I see your case. ok use this or this text format"    #javascript "just save .sql binary file into git"    xd
[21:28:43] <cbreak> .sql files are binary?
[21:29:08] <muhblockchain> what ever sqlite names it's files, they are binary, sadly for me
[21:29:14] <muhblockchain> *Its
[21:29:16] <cbreak> yeah, those are
[21:29:30] <cbreak> but you should be able to dump the data somehow
[21:29:51] <cbreak> via some export / import function
[21:30:05] <muhblockchain> well it needs to be a proper editor probably, not just a dump, to keep the file deterministic.  e.g. you can save openoffice flat files, but they change a lot

[22:09:33] <cbreak> and maybe git diff --cached
[22:10:15] <kuhilas> yeah true, I have mentioned the git status to her and this time it would have been useful
[22:10:38] <kuhilas> although after the commit you could also see suspicious things but oh well
[22:11:21] <kuhilas> so there is nothing left but sigal being the culprit. I guess it was updated and its behaviour has changed stricter to external files in paths it writes maybe
[22:11:54] <kuhilas> could try run that sigal in verbose mode too since I think it might have that too. Thanks again
