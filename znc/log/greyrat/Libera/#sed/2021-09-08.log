[11:06:51] <stevenm__> is it possible to have sed find the line with 'foo' then find the line after that with 'bar' and then insert 'meow' above line 'bar' ? :D
[11:07:34] <stevenm__> I tried... sed '/^foo/,/^bar/i meow'  
[11:07:44] <stevenm__> but that just inserts meow above all lines between foo and bar :)

[13:20:38] <[R]> stevenm__: seq 10 | sed '/^4/,/^7/ { /^7/i meow '$'\n}'
[13:43:07] <Soliton> portable way would be: sed $'/^4/,/^7/ { /^7/i\\\nmeow\n}'
[13:43:27] <Soliton> of course that will do the insert again if the range matches more than once.

[18:15:03] <stevenm__> [R], seq 10 | sed '/^4/,/^7/!b;/^7/i meow'
[18:15:47] <stevenm__> not entirely sure what the !b does mind you
[18:19:41] <Soliton> just another way to write the same thing. not portable either.
[18:23:05] <stevenm__> I never understand anyone's fixation with 'being portable'... looking at the world of regex as a whole (and not just regex used in any version of sed, GNU or otherwise)... there are so many small differences and quirks, it'd be impossible to 100% of the time make every regex thinkable completely portably amongst all applications that implement regex
[18:23:21] <stevenm__> so let GNU's sed be 'GNU sed' and let other sed's be 'other seds' .. is what I say :)
[18:23:30] <stevenm__> them sharing a name... mere coincidence 
[18:26:05] <Soliton> the regex example makes no sense but sure it depends if you write for a POSIX system or something else.
[18:26:30] <Soliton> since we have no idea what you write for i'd assume POSIX.
[18:27:21] <Soliton> the regex example would make sense for a specific regex dialect like BRE/ERE etc.
[18:27:38] <Soliton> in which case it's not difficult to write a conforming regex.
[18:29:13] <Soliton> if you have no clue what regex dialect you write for you can not even write a regex for one specific implementation.
[18:29:52] <Soliton> though you can certainly guess and it might even work.

[19:19:04] <geirha> much simpler to do that type of thing with awk, but ...  sed '0,\#^[^,]*,$jumpDate,#d'
[19:19:34] <geirha> requires GNU sed
[19:20:39] <geirha> awk -F, -v date=$jumpDate 'p{print} $2 == date { p = 1 }'
[19:20:53] <geirha> err
[19:21:00] <geirha> awk -F, -v "date=$jumpDate" 'p{print} $2 == date { p = 1 }'
[19:22:01] <geirha> and in the future, I'd recommend telling the csv export to format the dates in iso8601 format
[19:22:25] <geirha> ah wait, it was field 3 not 2
[19:22:33] <geirha> awk -F, -v "date=$jumpDate" 'p{print} $3 == date { p = 1 }'
[19:22:49] <geirha> sed '0,\#^[^,]*,[^,]*,$jumpDate,#d'
[19:23:18] <Soliton> ($jumpDate will not be expanded)
[19:23:34] <geirha> *sigh* wrong quotes
[19:23:44] <geirha> sed "0,\\#^[^,]*,[^,]*,$jumpDate,#d"
[19:23:48] <geirha> thanks
[19:25:09] <Soliton> if you know the first line cannot be the jump date you can also use 1 and it'll work with any sed.
