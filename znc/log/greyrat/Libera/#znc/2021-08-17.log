[11:40:50] <predicament> i might need some help beyond the wiki provided for SASL, though I doubt many are awake to deal with my stupid ass right now.  i had it the way it should've been and then i went and somehow screwed it up.  i am trying to avoid scrapping it for once.  i'm trying to do SSL, my subdomain is actually valid via letsencrypt (nginx) and this runs all on the same box.  and for reference, znc is running as a service/global daemon with systemd - arch linux - 
[11:40:50] <predicament> thats pretty much all info i can give without you guys wondering how stupid i am
[11:43:09] <predicament> i will refrain from asking for a bit if but if i cannot figure it out, i might be hittin you guys up with more specific questioning, but it's a SASL issue and possibly a certificate issue, though mine is valid, it doesn't mean i'm doing everything correctly with cert and certauth.  they're both loaded.  certauth tells me i'm not connecting with a key when i do /msg *certauth show

[12:02:49] <predicament> mm.
[12:02:49] <bookworm> let's encrypt has nothing to do with it really, you'll generate a self signed cert for the IRC servers
[12:03:57] <bookworm> what does /msg *cert info say?
[12:04:18] <predicament> not connected with a public key, but it has my list of keys i had once used, so
[12:04:24] <predicament> i know letsencrypt has nothing to do with it
[12:04:56] <bookworm> then why mention it?...
[12:04:59] <predicament> i just was saying it's a "valid" certificate i guess, and i'm trying to sorta tell you the history of what i did to have it working before vs now which is incredibly unclear
[12:05:17] <predicament> i ramble at times
[12:05:22] <bookworm> I was only partially following your rant in #libera, what are you actually trying to do?
[12:05:32] <bookworm> just connect to libera with a client cert?
[12:06:31] <predicament> to have SASL working with a certificate.  I mean it was working just fine before, but now.. I don't know what the hell happened.  i remember trying to do the whole automatic logic ordeal with hexchat
[12:06:36] <predicament> so someone said it was supported..
[12:06:43] <predicament> and i went and dilly'd around
[12:07:08] *** Quits: jmcgnh (~jmcgnh@wikipedia/jmcgnh) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[12:07:15] <bookworm> so, what do the connection logs say when you connect to libera?
[12:07:26] <predicament> and now i have no idea what i did because i was so distracted.  so i guess im gonna have to trash it if i dont figure it out.  and its not the biggest problem in the world but i'd rather keep the config i have if i could.  i had it configured globally
[12:07:29] <bookworm> do note that you want the logs of znc --> libera, not hexchat --> znc
[12:08:04] <predicament> ummm right now it says that sasl failed multiple times by me lol
[12:08:21] <predicament> literally tells me when it was last tried and so on
[12:08:28] <bookworm> >what does `/msg *cert info` say?
[12:09:12] <predicament> it doesnt even say a thing
[12:09:16] <predicament> cert is set though.
[12:09:36] <bookworm> no
[12:09:46] <bookworm> if it doesn't say anything you don't have a cert set at all
[12:09:50] <predicament> i mean in the webadmin dialogue it was saying how a certificate was set
[12:09:54] <predicament> thats weird...
[12:10:19] <predicament> thats what i thought when i got nothing i was like "oh son of a bitch"
[12:10:23] <predicament> "there's no way i have this wrong"
[12:10:24] <predicament> lol
[12:11:19] <predicament> let me check the web panel again
[12:11:28] <predicament> i really would prefer to work with .conf lol
[12:11:51] <predicament> and maybe i uploaded the cert improperly via web?
[12:13:00] <bookworm> didn't hit apply?
[12:13:04] <predicament> i did
[12:13:12] <bookworm> so you think ;)
[12:14:13] <predicament> i clicked apply, still nothing.  i think im just not uploading it properly because im not sure if i need the entire PEM in there or what?  like i.e. cat znc.pem or whatever, for instance
[12:14:29] <predicament> just as an example
[12:15:19] <bookworm> > im not sure if i need the entire PEM in there or what? well, exactly what's written here: https://wiki.znc.in/Cert
[12:15:26] <bookworm> you've been given that link before
[12:15:35] <predicament> cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/thunder.h3ck3d.us/{privkey,fullchain}.pem > /home/hahaha/znc.pem
[12:15:37] <predicament> ugh
[12:15:53] <bookworm> no, stop messing with your let's encrypt certs
[12:16:00] <bookworm> you don't need those, at all
[12:16:03] <predicament> it's just the only one i've been using
[12:16:08] <predicament> and now i see
[12:16:09] <bookworm> why?
[12:16:39] <bookworm> the thing is meant to be used as a user facing cert for a webserver or some such, it isn't meant to identify you to a irc network
[12:16:55] <predicament> webserver
[12:16:56] <predicament> yes
[12:16:58] <predicament> lol
[12:16:59] <bookworm> that certs is getting invalidated after 90ish days or so, meaning you couldn't log in after that
[12:17:04] <predicament> right
[12:17:07] <predicament> it renews.
[12:17:18] <predicament> with my hook
[12:17:20] <bookworm> which is really really besides the point of using cert auth to a network
[12:17:32] <predicament> ^ okay, so now we're getting somewhere
[12:17:51] <bookworm> consider the cert between znc --> IRC server (say libera) to be a fancy version of a password
[12:18:09] <bookworm> it doesn't need to be "valid" as far as your browser is concerned, different responsibilities
[12:18:22] <bookworm> really, follow the guide I linked, EXACTLY
[12:18:38] <bookworm> don't do some things which you think are needed, follow the effing guide

[20:46:06] <vinay> Hello everyone
[20:46:52] <vinay> Is Znc bouncer available for all irc clients
[20:46:57] <vinay> Like libera.chat
[20:49:40] <Casper> For all irc networks you mean.
[20:49:44] <jonher> vinay yes, ZNC is free software. Just install and use it. If you wanted a free BNC account instead, go somewhere else. https://wiki.znc.in/Providers may be a good start.
[20:50:30] <Casper> It can connect to the networks that you can connect to yourself in general (If you host it yourself, that is).
[20:55:15] <vinay> What is BNC
[20:56:03] <jonher> bnc = bouncer, znc is a irc bouncer
[20:56:17] <vinay> jonher: so I can just run the znc bouncer on any free or paid server like AWS GCP
[20:56:30] <jonher> yes
[20:56:45] <vinay> jonher: where did you deploy it 
[20:56:58] <jonher> on my server with docker
[20:57:21] <vinay> jonher: that's great 
[20:58:34] <vinay> Can I deploy znc on raspberry pi too?
[20:58:45] <knolle> sure
[21:00:21] <vinay> Can I run two different docker containers at the same time 
[21:00:23] <vinay> ?
[21:00:43] * Khaytsus blinks
[21:00:46] <Casper> Why wouldn't you?
[21:01:02] <Casper> But also, why would you? :P
[21:01:03] <knolle> if you couldn't, it would be pretty pointless
[21:02:06] <vinay> jonher: I m a beginner learning docker
[21:02:12] <vinay> So asked it
[21:02:37] <vinay> knolle: I m a beginner
[21:05:50] <vinay> Could you please share resources to learn docker
[21:06:20] <knolle> #docker
[21:07:08] <Khaytsus> https://google.com/search?q=docker
[21:20:07] <vinay> Khaytsus: :)
