[09:56:01] <acagastya> @sheep -- I am using the default behaviour of `curl` without flags -- I am seeing the content in the terminal, but when I pipe it to `tar` for extraction, it is writing to the file instead of standard output (as it should), but is there a way to write to standard output instead of file?
[09:56:51] <sheep> are you trying to make tar output to stdout?
[09:57:41] <acagastya> @sheep -- I am trying to, yes.
[09:57:51] <sheep> tar doesn't work that way. It either serializes files into a stream (like stdout) or deserialzies a stream (like stdin) to files
[09:58:32] <sheep> do you just want to decompress the tar file and output the decompressed tar file, not the files inside it, to stdout?
[09:58:40] <sheep> if so, which compression format is it using? xz?
[09:58:55] <acagastya> gz.
[09:59:15] <jim> you're trying to pipe curl output to tar?
[09:59:23] <acagastya> Yes.
[09:59:32] <sheep> curl http://whatever | gunzip -c -
[09:59:42] <jim> why not pipe tar output to tar

[10:52:06] <acagastya> Sauvin: I created a tar.gz of a single file, serving using a simple http server.  In the other terminal, I want to curl it, and pipe the output to tar, for extracting, but I don't want the data of "% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time".  I think that is coming from `curl`?  How do I mute that?
[10:53:07] <Sauvin> I'm not sure since I never curl anything. My _real_ question is: could the unwanted text be filtered out through something written in some scripting or programming language such as awk, python or perl?
[10:54:09] <pnbeast> Hmm, my real question is "why are you doing this?"  What's the real problem you're trying to solve with this?  (and, in particular, why would you make a tarball of a single file?)
[10:54:10] * Sauvin admits ruefully enough to knowing damn little about tar

[10:56:32] <tm512> curl isn't a standard utility, so it's not like curl's behavior is really going to change from system to system like some other system utilities can
[10:57:25] <acagastya> pnbeast, re "(and, in particular, why would you make a tarball of a single file?)", that is because I know the text file has repeatition, and can be compressed by ~35% (this particular one) -- and I intend to have a lot of text files -- instead of just `curl`ing them, compressing them will save a lot of storage.
[10:57:48] <tm512> for a .tar.gz, just make sure you include z in the command line arguments for tar, because I think there are some implementations of tar that don't automatically detect compression like GNU tar does
[10:57:51] <jim> does curl have some sort of "quiet" option?
[10:58:24] <acagastya> Yes, -s
[10:58:51] <acagastya> silent, to not have the progress bar.
[10:58:59] <tm512> acagastya: you don't need to tar a single file in order to compress it, you can just use gzip directly

[11:01:55] <acagastya> Well why am I doing it? -- to minimise file size I am storing (and serving).
[11:02:01] <acagastya> Thanks tm512!
[11:03:31] <Duchess> I am getting "Error: Invalid version flag: or" when trying to install Skype "sudo yum localinstall ./skypeforlinux-64.rpm" Did not find anything on the web.  Any ideas?
[11:04:04] <tm512> no problem. only really need to use tar when you want to distribute a set of files as a single archive. you could also use tar if there's inter-file redundancy, the dictionary compression on a tar file will be able to reference repeats from other files
[11:05:44] <tm512> but yeah if you just want to compress and distribute individual files, just compressing them individually is the way to go. I think gzip can take multiple files as arguments and it'll compress each one by one, so you could use a glob in the shell
[11:05:47] *** Quits: soun (~soun@49.37.43.206) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[11:06:56] <acagastya> That will save me a lot of time too, thanks for that too, tm512!
[11:07:50] <tm512> and if you want higher compression at the expense of CPU, there's xz which uses the LZMA algorithm that's also used in 7zip's .7z files. maybe worth doing some comparisons
[11:11:04] *** Joins: xrogaan (~xrogaan@user/xrogaan)
[11:11:07] <acagastya> I would need to compress only once, and my priority is storage (decompressing a file which was originally 2KB should not be *too much* for CPU, I am guessing).  The use case would require `curl`ing and decompressing, but the original files are small to begin with.
[11:11:55] *** Joins: thelounge4880 (5111123e@67.205.143.82)
[11:13:36] <tm512> if the files, even gzipped, would take up considerable storage, then xz might be a better option, but it's considerably slower
[11:13:47] *** Quits: Al-Khwarizmi (~Al-Khwari@d24-57-234-201.home.cgocable.net) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[11:14:02] <Sauvin> If the curls on different *nix don't work all the same, you might consider using a language like perl that has appropriate packages to handle curl-like functionality. The advantage here would be consistency across platforms.
[11:14:39] <Sauvin> tm512, *compression* would be slower, but *uncompressing* shouldn't be dramatically different.

[11:15:01] <tm512> Sauvin: ah
[11:15:34] <Sauvin> I suspect the major difference is in how the dictionaries are constructed.
[11:15:52] <Sauvin> Once having been constructed, however, *uncompressing* is just dictionary lookup.
[11:16:08] <acagastya> I have higher priority on storage as compared to CPU -- so xz seems like the best option, thanks for that :D
[11:16:12] <tm512> also one newer option is Zstd, which is very fast afaik, iirc it beats gzip on compression ratio while still being faster, but I may be misremembering
[11:16:40] <Sauvin> "as far as I know" and "if I recall correctly", not "afaik" and "iirc", please.
[11:17:28] <tm512> I'm not planning on typing those out every single time I need to say that
[11:18:25] <tm512> I've never run into an IRC channel that had any problem with common abbreviations like that
[11:18:32] <Sauvin> See the /topic.
[11:18:41] <lopid> well, now Sauvin needs to feel justified in having done it
[11:18:43] <Sauvin> Too much of that kind of writing is hard to read.
[11:19:43] <acagastya> Surprisingly, gzip was better in this one case of xz -- so I would clearly need to run some statistics at some point in time.

[13:46:02] <bob_x2> interesting
[13:46:21] <bob_x2> so removing xscreensaver software should off this auto-lock feature. if it's xscreensaver
[13:46:29] <bob_x2> it's easy to try
[13:47:20] <mlu> right, or at least you should be able to configure it
[13:47:21] <bob_x2> well I do not have xscreensaver installed. but it's in repos
[13:47:31] <mlu> hmm
[13:47:39] <tm512> I'd be surprised if there weren't a config option for the auto-lock, but it might be in a config file somewhere and not provided in a GUI settings program
[13:47:58] <tm512> also I thought LXDE had been abandoned, with work being focused on LXQt
[13:48:07] <bob_x2> yeah ... maybe I should google openbox auto-lock

[14:41:52] <hexnewbie> Like, for some reason, I tether my phone with kppp. Don't know why, but in case of an emergency and need for internet on my PC. I suppose NetworkManager can do the same, and better, but for something I would need once a year, I've not invested in finding out how. So the loss of kppp has been non-trivial for me.

[14:48:21] <hexnewbie> duuude: wvdial is just something that made dial-up easy to set up. USB modems that carriers sell here do appear as either a network card, or a /dev/ttyACM0 device on which you dial up. wvdial is still way easier than doing ppp yourself :)
[14:48:42] <bsandro> 3G modem is not that different from old dialup - same serial connection, same "AT" initial command iirc

[18:14:21] <phogg> hexnewbie: seems like the problem is that most voices don't try to support the full range of sounds and so anything doing ipa must have per-voice or per-language approximation rules.
[18:15:10] <hexnewbie> Well, IPA has subsets for different languages, though I hope the same IPA symbol means the same thing in all languages that have the given symbol, with some minor variation at worst

[20:09:30] <rascul> looks like $XDG_DATA_DIRS can have multiple paths separated with : (like $PATH) so you'll want to check the applications directory in each $XDG_DATA_DIRS path

The other waits for socket events and return their status.  For example, an event could be wait for ping success or failure.  Also, a regex can be used against a tcp response.  For example, to test if a GET request works or not.  Any comments welcome.

[23:54:52] <kapaun> Existing connections will die?
[23:54:57] <kapaun> all my existing connections seem fine...
[23:54:57] <ayecee> yes
[23:55:12] <ayecee> kapaun: when the interface with the current default route goes down.
[23:55:45] <ayecee> barring some unusual network configuration
[23:55:51] *** hendrix_ is now known as hendrix
[23:55:56] <kapaun> What kind of setup should I do to prevent my second adapter from being a default route?
[23:56:02] <kapaun> I just want it to connect to local devices on Network 2
[23:56:19] <ayecee> might be in the config for that connection somewhere
[23:56:25] <Blondie101010> I think you should not worry if things are working
[23:56:30] <Blondie101010> address problems as they come up
[23:56:31] <ayecee> i don't know what that looks like on your screen
[23:56:53] *** Quits: Junglist (~Junglist@user/junglist) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:57:03] <Blondie101010> if that machine is not used as a server, things won't be as complicated
[23:57:05] <george_orwl84> anyone recommending manjaro?
[23:57:09] <kapaun> hmm network namespaces are acting funny
[23:57:18] <ayecee> george_orwl84: manjaro users quite often do
[23:57:20] *** Quits: glassy (~glassy@user/glassy) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:57:22] <Blondie101010> ugh
[23:57:33] *** Joins: Junglist (~Junglist@user/junglist)
[23:57:36] <Blondie101010> is this a server?
[23:57:45] <george_orwl84> ayecee what system are you using?
[23:58:04] <ayecee> a beige one
[23:58:10] <george_orwl84> ubuntu?
[23:58:22] <kapaun> this might be a seperate issue
[23:58:29] <kapaun> I have two seperate network namespaces
[23:58:34] <kapaun> and when I enter the second one
[23:58:36] <kapaun> it sends me into the first
[23:58:55] <Blondie101010> you do have to define that explicitly
[23:59:02] *** FESTIVUS-MAXIMUS is now known as Festivus-Maximus
[23:59:40] <hexnewbie> kapaun: You can tell Network Manager not to receive routes from that network, at least that's available in the KDE GUI
