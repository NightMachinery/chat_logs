[05:17:44] <macrobat> heian court music is a little jarring
[05:19:23] <artao> oh yeah. rice and veggies stir fried. that hit the spot. heavy on the hoisin sauce
[05:22:08] <artao> everyone should have a rice cooker and a wok
[05:22:17] *** Quits: idwer (~irc@user/idwer) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:22:20] <piercedwater> i tried jasmine thai rice recently
[05:22:33] <piercedwater> seemed to be more filling than minute rice 
[05:22:38] <artao> mm
[05:22:54] <piercedwater> fluffy!
[05:23:02] <artao> have you ever tried brown basmati rice?
[05:23:07] <piercedwater> not that i remember
[05:23:13] <piercedwater> dirty rice is good to me as well
[05:23:22] <artao> well ... that's a dish
[05:23:26] <artao> and yeah, yum
[05:23:32] <piercedwater> oic
[05:24:13] <artao> and wild rice is of course aweszome too. but pricey. unless you collect it yourself
[05:24:19] <artao> which is time consuming
[05:24:32] <piercedwater> do you like brown bread?
[05:24:33] <artao> and ya kinda need a boat
[05:24:38] <louipc> and theres some laws around collecting wild rice
[05:24:39] <artao> oh yes
[05:24:43] <artao> full grain
[05:24:46] <piercedwater> me too. with raisins!
[05:24:54] <piercedwater> (in a can - sorry)
[05:24:58] <artao> cheap ass white bread is barely worth eathing
[05:25:05] <piercedwater> same
[05:25:46] <artao> and making bread. tho right now i only have all purpose white flour
[05:26:03] <artao> whole wheat flour isn't so great for cookies
[05:26:33] <piercedwater> brown sugar?
[05:27:34] <artao> that can be tricky to use
[05:28:00] <artao> cookies are far trickier than bread i tell you what. MUCH more recipe sensitive, as well as how you mix the ingredients
[05:28:24] <artao> brown sugar will give a more "caramel" flavor and you'll prolly need a bit more liquid
[05:28:29] <piercedwater> ah
[05:28:45] <piercedwater> i've never noticed that
[05:28:55] <artao> you make cookies?
[05:28:59] <piercedwater> not often
[05:29:02] <artao> hmm ... maybe i should make some cookies LOL
[05:29:05] <piercedwater> haha
[05:29:23] <artao> i'll go thru phases where i make a bunch then don't for a long while
[05:30:05] <piercedwater> i don't like to bake much any more because of dirty dishes
[05:30:14] <artao> heh i hear that
[05:30:14] <piercedwater> pita
[05:30:19] <morf> somebody puked in elevator 
[05:30:23] <piercedwater> lol
[05:30:23] <morf> it's there for like 4 hours
[05:30:33] <Panther> Score: 2
[05:30:33] <Panther> -3 is a perfect score.
[05:30:33] <Panther> If you scored anything under 5 points you're basically OK.
[05:30:36] <piercedwater> brb gotta pick out music
[05:30:37] <artao> my bread making bowl still has dough crust in it from the last time i made bread several years ago LOL
[05:30:47] <morf> can i get some points?
[05:30:49] <artao> just soda bread tho, not yeast. so it's fine
[05:30:55] <morf> how many drugs can i buy for one point? :P 
[05:31:01] <Panther> Sure... 
[05:31:09] <artao> piercedwater speaking of pita .... those are pretty easy to make too
[05:31:12] <morf> soda bread? 
[05:31:13] * Panther pulls out some darts and takes aim.
[05:31:24] * morf takes cover
[05:31:27] <artao> and freeze well. whip up a big batch and jus tstore em. and tortillas of course. couldn't be easier LOL
[05:31:29] * piercedwater hides behind morf
[05:31:35] <morf> that's smart
[05:31:40] <morf> also racist
[05:31:46] <morf> are you fat shaming me mister
[05:31:47] <morf> ?
[05:31:48] <piercedwater> i am American
[05:31:49] <Panther> morfist
[05:31:51] <morf> :]
[05:31:54] <morf> antimorfist
[05:31:56] <artao> soda bread i.e. made with baking powder and baking soda rather than yeast, for the leavening
[05:32:12] <morf> aha
[05:32:14] <macrobat> cleaning up after baking takes effort, but if I get a breadmachine, it will cluter up the place
[05:32:18] <morf> but soda bread sounds disgusting
[05:32:23] <Panther> Between 10 and 16 points you have a problem - Get some help.
[05:32:25] <morf> like something you would make from coca cola
[05:32:27] <Panther> :)
[05:32:39] <artao> LOL yeah. that'd be gross
[05:32:40] <morf> well where is the scoring machine?
[05:32:46] <morf> is it online?
[05:32:59] <macrobat> they make bread from sodapop? won't the pH kill the yeast?
[05:33:05] <morf> anyway i score good in any crazy test 
[05:33:14] <morf> which is not great
[05:33:38] <Panther> https://www.danpena.co.uk/success-test-v3/
[05:33:39] <Janet> ^ Error retrieving title. Check the log for more details.
[05:33:47] <artao> speaking of acid .. soda bread actually needs an acidic base to activate the baking powder and baking soda
[05:33:52] <morf> lol
[05:33:55] <morf> ok 
[05:34:00] <morf> i don't think i will score in that
[05:34:00] <artao> generally buttermilk is in recipes, but just a dash of white vinegar works too
[05:34:05] <artao> you don't taste the vinegar
[05:34:22] <morf> Fill in your details to take the test
[05:34:23] <morf> lol
[05:34:29] <morf> artao, what's your name and email?

[05:35:15] <artao> mmmm fresh baked buns
[05:35:30] <morf> agree or disagree i hate those questions 
[05:35:49] <morf> I frequently find myself not telling others about my good luck so that they will not have to feel envious.
[05:35:50] <morf> sometimes
[05:36:08] <macrobat> idk, would I take a srs test from someone who also hands out bznz test?
[05:36:19] <morf> say waht
[05:36:40] <morf> shit i clicked wrong option
[05:37:07] <morf> and again
[05:37:10] <morf> damn it
[05:38:28] <morf> I feel self-conscious when someone who "counts" compliments me.
[05:38:29] <morf> lol 
[05:38:33] <morf> what kind of question is that
[05:39:09] <morf> A sure-fire way to end up disappointed is to want something too much.
[05:39:11] <morf> a what?
[05:40:06] <morf> Score: 6
[05:40:10] <morf> Between 5 and 10 points you're moderately at risk for self-sabotaging behavior.

[05:42:59] <morf> i was only depressed when i was teenager 
[05:43:03] <louipc> while yelling at you
[05:43:06] <macrobat> "snowflake"? sounds like a dummy
[05:43:23] <louipc> wonder why there arent more memes with danpena tho
[05:43:44] * morf thinks Panther is very selfconcious 
[05:44:29] <morf> i can't pass the captcha test for the snowflake test lol
[05:44:32] <artao> poor phrasing
[05:44:35] <morf> hh
[05:44:38] <morf> phrasing!
[05:44:47] <morf> space phrasing!
[05:44:48] <artao> does that mean that when i was a teenager i was only depressed. never happy or anything else?
[05:44:59] <artao> or that i've not been depressed since being a tten?

[05:50:07] <morf> wtf seriously
[05:50:17] <morf> that's test made by some milenial 
[05:50:46] <Panther> Perception is reality. Do you see yourself being a billionaire and snorting up money?
[05:50:48] <Panther> :)
[05:51:00] <morf> that's hardly psychologically correct test

[05:52:53] <morf> Do you understand "spare the rod and spoil the child" and you implement it? *
[05:52:56] <Panther> That was for the 'super cuccess test'
[05:53:00] <morf> but that's 2 questions
[05:53:06] <morf> and only 1 answer
[05:53:08] <Panther> Complain
[05:53:23] <morf> maybe it is
[05:53:28] <morf> :]
[05:53:57] <Panther> It would be kinda funny to see what he would say if you told him yo didn't like one of the questions on his web test. :)
[05:54:09] <morf> jesus the ui is horrible
[05:54:30] <Panther> It's a google form I think.
[05:54:31] <morf> 10 points
[05:54:32] <morf> If you scored 0 – 14 then:
[05:54:32] <morf> You are a hopeless case! You are a fucking snowflake and if you have kids, they are at irreversible risk!
[05:54:41] <morf> that would figure
[05:54:57] <morf> but honestly the test was horrible so yeah 
[05:55:02] <morf> obviously i didn't do great at it 
[05:55:03] <morf> XD

[06:32:00] <ezio> I stumbled upon the song Atlantic City, and played it at the cottage.  At Christmas, everyone was a The Band aficionado.  My brother knew like every live version of their top songs.
[06:32:33] <morf> you what
[06:34:28] <ezio> Atlantic City by The Band.  It played on Spotify one day probably after I said, "Ok, Google, play The Weight by The Band."
[06:34:36] <ezio> And I was like this song is lit.
[06:34:51] <ezio> So I added it to my list.  It came up while I was playing music over the speaker, and I was like
[06:34:59] <ezio> Oh, hey.  Fuckin' love this song.
[06:35:38] <ezio> And apparently everyone else did because they all knew their top songs, and my brother had like Springsteen's version and a bunch of live ones in his Spoitfy likes.
[06:36:07] <ezio> I mean months later they did.
[06:36:37] <ezio> So like I turned them onto The Band.
[06:37:44] <ezio> The year before I stumbled upon Otis Redding's version of Hard to Handle, and pretty much everyone was like, I like this version better.  Agreed.  Those are my two wins lately.

[23:27:25] <piercedwater> i don't know what makes it acceptable to say and such, but yeah. i agree there is a double standard for sure
[23:30:57] * sublim20 adds another standard
[23:31:01] <sublim20> there, three.
[23:36:00] <piercedwater> :o
[23:36:27] <novns> piercedwater, it's some big pharma corporation behind those "artists"
[23:37:52] <novns> they have sold their rights, and now they are smearing Joe Rogan
[23:38:38] <sublim20> bro brogan?
[23:38:50] <sublim20> you mean, gwyneth paltrow for dudes?
[23:39:13] <sublim20> yo, lemme ask you a question, and then immediately cut you off and tell you about dmt

[23:39:42] <Janet> ^ EXPOSED: Neil Young heavily linked to big pharma and Pfizer
[23:41:13] <novns> so all this "racist" bullshit is just a bullshit paid by Pfizer
[23:42:34] <piercedwater> ah, i care about the lack of pay the artists are getting
[23:42:59] <piercedwater> doesn't suprise me if there is a big corp behind the racist talk

[23:46:55] <macrobat> rogan needs no smear, he's awful in his own right
[23:50:34] <novns> macrobat, he talks about dirty business in big pharma, and they cannot sue him directly
[23:50:57] <macrobat> you're smart enough to see that the article you linked is dishonest
[23:52:46] <novns> macrobat, it doesn't matter, facts are still the same
[23:54:53] <macrobat> whether or not fish oil helps against covid is not a matter of opinion

[23:55:24] <novns> a corporation pays impoverished celebrities to slander an inconvenient person
[23:55:28] <macrobat> no
[23:55:35] <novns> that's it
[23:57:42] <novns> and now I'm back to my covid
[23:57:59] <macrobat> that's really a weak connection: an ex-boss may still own stock and may have suggested some musicians withdraw?
[23:58:02] <novns> I feel a little better after a week
[23:58:42] <macrobat> so it's worse than anything vitamin D could fix?
[23:59:07] <novns> it was 39°C for three days
[23:59:58] <novns> muscle pain here and there
