[03:37:31] <joepie91> lmao
[03:39:10] <ThePendulum> I bought a 1969 curta calculator a year or two ago, that thing is extremely well documented though, and I have like the 400,000th unit or something
[03:39:23] <ThePendulum> this one says 7184, not sure if that's linearly how many of these were made

[20:11:52] <ThePendulum> joepie91: this is the cannon my particular device was meant to be used for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/85_mm_divisional_gun_D-44
[20:12:06] <ThePendulum> however it could be used for any cannon if you replace the scroll
[20:12:28] <ThePendulum> they probably wouldn't do that in the field, though, they would just bring another one of these devices with the correct sroll installed
