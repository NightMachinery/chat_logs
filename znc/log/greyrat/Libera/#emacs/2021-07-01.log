[02:06:06] <grym> but the meta question, so nicely said by i think hawking, of "What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?"  is both 1. not science and 2. dude, nobody knows
[02:06:20] <grym> yates: the anthropic principle is "why is the universe the way that it is" "if it wasn't, we wouldn't be here to ask!"
[02:06:33] <grym> extraordinarily unsatisfying answer to a really meta question

[02:08:00] <lampilelo> Plazma: writeroom-mode or olivetti maybe?
[02:08:08] <yates> grym: my mind wants to formulate the answer as some type of "medium" which gives E/M waves their velocity..
[02:08:41] <yates> but what "medium" causes E/M waves to propagate?
[02:08:46] <grym> yates: i'm no physicist, but i believe we call that spacetime, now.
[02:08:50] * yates asks Maxwell...
[02:09:07] <grym> lampilelo: those center text and add distraction-free stuff, but they don't skin the background

[02:10:07] <Plazma> lampilelo: so that's sorta close, but id want like it to have an image or look like real notebook paper with lines :P
[02:10:13] <Plazma> kinda like xournal does
[02:11:29] <grym> rudybot: make yourself more skeuomorphic
[02:11:33] <rudybot> grym: If you’ve ever used an Apple product, you’ve experienced digital skeuomorphic design: calendars with faux leather-stitching, bookshelves with wood veneers, fake glass and paper and brushed chrome. Skeuomorphism is a catch-all term for when objects retain ornamental elements of past, derivative iterations--elements that are no longer necessary to the current objects’ functions.
[02:11:35] <lampilelo> i don't think you can set an image as a background in current version of emacs, i may be mistaken though
[02:12:04] <Plazma> lampilelo: it's more also not just an image but that the text would be on a line and look normal/nice, etc
[02:12:24] <yates> grym: there is a little magic in the specific formulation of $$\alpha = \frac{c\mu_0}{2R_K}$$ here, namely the $R_K$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20the%20fine%2Dstructure,interaction%20between%20elementary%20charged%20particles.

[06:10:59] <twb> aidalgol: none of the AOSP apps (e.g. com.android.launcher3, com.android.calculator2) are in the play store – so unless your ROM has them pre-installed, you can't ever install them.

[07:42:16] <Wafficus> honestly, I'm not really sure. I honestly suck at gpg. I understand the idea behind it, you encrypt a file, throw away the regular file and keep the gpg key

[13:26:32] <bpalmer> I don't think it's established that licenses propagate to models based on it.
[13:27:19] <bpalmer> If I train a neural net on millions of images, some copyrighted and some not, the various copyrights are unlikely to cover a new artificially generated image.
[13:27:35] <bkhl> No, that could be considered just reading the content and making use of the knowledge.
[13:27:44] <bkhl> Similar to if you read a book and then quoted it or something like that.
[13:28:36] <bpalmer> Ah, this was covered in the Author's Guild vs Google case, in which Google used copyrighted book material to train its book search algorithm.
[13:28:43] <bpalmer> The courts held this was fair use.
[13:28:47] <bpalmer> (in the US)
[13:28:49] <bkhl> That said there are corpus creators that would like to control the use of their corpus that way and tries to make claims like that
[13:29:12] <bkhl> Yeah, it's in principle pretty similar to a search engine.
[13:29:18] <bkhl> First you do a search to find some content.
[13:29:38] <bkhl> Then you use a small enough part of that for it to fall under fair use/quotation rules/etc depending on jurisdiction

[13:33:50] <bkhl> That depends on how much you are up for a court fight with RIAA I gues.
[13:34:07] <bpalmer> I suspect that the EU and other jurisdictions will have to argue about this, too, since they have slightly different rules and traditions.

[20:10:23] <yates_work> i need it for browse-url-browser-function
[20:10:55] <yates_work> it WouldBeNice(TM) if browse-url.el found that out by default. i tried setting browse-url-browser-function to nil but that didn't do it
[20:12:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Personally I kinda disagree. I like that it defaults to using eww and not opening the memory-hungry browser if I don't have it open.
[20:13:11] <wgreenhouse> yates_work: the canned options for that in customize should help. at worst you can set it to the generic one, then say that the generic browser is `xdg-open`

[20:17:49] <wasamasa> yes
[20:17:56] <wasamasa> the usual browsers provide them
[20:18:11] <wgreenhouse> even most unusual ones
[20:18:23] <wasamasa> but if you write some funny browser script, you need to make your own .desktop file
[20:18:44] <wgreenhouse> I'd prefer the default to be eww

[22:29:59] <YoungPotato> Hi all, I am experiencing this weird phenomenon with term (and ansi-term). See this example here https://dpaste.org/tFve When I type long text on a line and it will go over the line, it does not continue on the next line. As you can see in the example, I started with 'echo aaaaaaabbbbbb' until the b's came back to the beginning of the line. When I press enter, it correctly shows 'aaaaaaabbbbbbb' however. Any ideas what this may be
[22:29:59] <YoungPotato> related to or how to fix it?

[22:30:59] <YoungPotato> If my example is not clear, I could record a screen cast.
[22:32:00] <wasamasa> is TERM correct?
[22:32:39] <YoungPotato> wasamasa: Could you please elaborate?
[22:32:44] <wasamasa> echo $TERM
[22:33:06] <YoungPotato> It returns 'eterm-color'
[22:33:10] <wasamasa> well, good
[22:33:42] <YoungPotato> By the way, this happens both in GUI and CLI emacs.
[22:34:11] <wasamasa> what does `resize` believe the terminal dimensions are?
[22:34:12] <wickedjargon> did you test this with `emacs -q`
[22:34:32] <wasamasa> though, perhaps this is better tested with the corresponding stty invocation
[22:34:49] <wasamasa> `stty size`
