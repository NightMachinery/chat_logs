[07:25:44] <[itchyjunk]> are there other fields with characteristics 2?
[07:26:09] <[itchyjunk]> wait maybe i misunderstood
[07:26:18] <Z-module> twJizhan: the statement is this. If n is natural and >= 3, and if A, B are any two bounded sets in R^n each with nonempty interior (so they each contain some open n-ball), then there is some natural k and a partition of A into subsets A_1, ..., A_k, also one of B into subsets B_1, ..., B_k, such that for each i, some rigid motion in R^n takes A_i exactly onto B_i.
[07:27:58] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:  sure, lots of others. Like F_4, F_8, ..., and infinite ones like F_2(X) = field of fractions of F_2[X], where X is any set of indeterminates.
[07:29:54] <Z-module> bosspotato: of course that's false. The set {1, x, x^2, x^3, ...} is an infinite basis for the polynomial ring R[x] considered simply as a vector space over R.

[07:54:25] <Z-module> it's just that   x +...+ x = 1x +... + 1x = (1 +...+ 1)x = 0x = 0     where each multisum thing in there uses p copies
[07:54:29] <[itchyjunk]> q we don't care about?
[07:55:26] <Z-module> If p is positive and the sum of p copies of anything is 0, then so also are sums of 2p copies, and 3p copies, etc.  We want a unique thing to call the characteristic.
[07:55:52] <[itchyjunk]> can't q also be a 0 where q is not a multiple of p ?
[07:56:01] <Z-module> If there is no positive p such that for all x, the sum of p copies of x is 0, then we define the characteristic to be 0.

[08:56:14] <jenna8912> Funny thing about linear spaces over Q is you do not have to postulate (x in L)=>(kx in L), it follows from (x, y in L)=>(x+y in L)
[08:56:19] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:  it only seems crazy since you're very used to seeing vector spaces over the field R. The field R is of course a 1-dimensional vector space over R, using the pre-existing opreations from R for this vector space.  But the point is that R has *zillions* of proper subfields K, such as Q,  Q(sqrt(2)),  Q(pi), etc.  In fact, it turns out (this is far less elementary), if K is *any* proper subfield of R at all, the dimension
[08:56:20] <Z-module> [R:K] has to be infinite.

[09:06:12] <Z-module> jenna8912: Let T be any "transcendence basis" for R over Q -- that means, a maximal algebraically (over Q) independent set of reals. These exist, but only non-constructively.  Let K = Q(T) = the subfield of R generated by  Q cup T.  Then R is algebraic over K, so [R:K] is at most aleph_0, and it's actually infinite (thus actually aleph_0) since, as you can show, if you pick some t in T, then the set {|t|^(1/2), |t|^(1/3), |t|^(1/4),
[09:06:12] <Z-module> ...}  is linearly independent over K.

[15:33:30] <isekaijin> F is a field by assumption. Maybe you meant you didn't get why F[a] is a field?
[15:33:51] <isekaijin> If a is algebraic, then F[x] -> F[a] has a nontrivial kernel.
[15:34:07] <isekaijin> The kernel is the ideal of F[x] generated by the minimal polynomial of a.
[15:34:34] <isekaijin> This minimal polynomial is irreducible, hence it generates a maximal ideal of F[x]. (We are using the fact that F[x] is a PID.)
[15:35:09] <isekaijin> Now, the map F[x] -> F[a] is surjective by construction, hence F[a] is isomorphic to F[x] / ker.
[15:35:31] <isekaijin> Since the kernel is a maximal ideal, F[x] / ker is a field. Since F[a] is isomorphic to that, then F[a] is a field.
[15:36:08] <cadmio> the fact that is finite derives from F[a] being a field?
[15:36:49] <isekaijin> Suppose the minimal polynomial has degree d.
[15:37:20] <isekaijin> Then, in F[x] / ker, we can express x^d as a linear combination of 1, x, x^2, ..., x^{d-1}.
[15:37:38] <isekaijin> Hence, F[x] / ker is a d-dimensional vector space.
[15:37:59] <isekaijin> Actually, the isomorphism F[x]/ker -> F[a] isn't just a ring isomorphism, but rather an isomorphism of F-algebras.
[15:38:06] <isekaijin> Hence F[a] is also a d-dimensional F-vector space.
[15:38:40] <isekaijin> Or, if you want, you can directly observe that a^d is a linear combination of 1, a, a^2, ..., a^{d-1}.

[15:58:53] <riv> We have seen that we only need to prove 1 thing: a is algebraic iff F[a] is finite

[15:59:19] <riv> do you know how to prove that direction?

[19:23:20] <Simplar> Hopes down for a simple solution
[19:23:30] <dude12312414> so you need another way to prove a*0 = 0

[19:23:38] <dude12312414> oh
[19:23:43] <dude12312414> you use 0 + 0 = 0
[19:23:47] <dude12312414> that's what you do
[19:24:17] <isekaijin> dude12312414: You can deduce a * 0 = 0 from a * 0 = a * (1 + (-1)) = a * 1 + a * (-1) = a + (-a) = 0.
[19:24:33] <dude12312414> but for the last step you need a*(-1) = -a

[19:29:38] <[itchyjunk]> so a + (-a) = 0 because of abelian group. 1 * z = z since 1 is mult identity. so 1*(a+(-a)) = 0 => (1*a + 1 * (-a)) = 0 => a + (1 * (-a)) = 0 => (1*(-a)) = (-a)

[19:51:43] <[itchyjunk]> What do you need for an algebra again? a set equipped with some collection of subsets and some axioms?
[19:51:44] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: that's right. Oh actually, this whole problem left out a detail. When we said L is a subfield of F, meaning a subring of F that is a field in itself, this needs the 1 of L to = the 1 of F (which most people already require for something to be a "subring" in the first place). To see why this is relevant, consider F = Z/2Z x Z/2Z, L = Z/2Z x 0.  The "1" of this field L is (1,0), and it's not true that this times each v in F
[19:51:44] <Z-module> gives v back again.
[19:52:31] <Simplar> Is subtraction a binary operation over natural numbers?
[19:52:32] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[19:52:40] <Simplar> It's not defined for exactly all natural numbers
[19:52:41] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: watch out: an "algebra of sets" is not related to an algebra over a field (or over any commutative ring).
[19:52:51] <[itchyjunk]> Simplar, 1 - 2 \in N ?
[19:52:57] <Simplar> False
[19:52:58] <Simplar> So?
[19:53:12] <[itchyjunk]> does your def of binary operation require closure?
[19:53:22] <[itchyjunk]> Z-module, ah
[19:53:38] <[itchyjunk]> damn it, algebra means too many thing :<
[19:53:48] <riv> it is a binary operation but it is not closed.. I guess?
[19:54:01] <riv> maybe it's better to say - : Z x Z -> Z
[19:54:06] <riv> and we have an injection N -> Z
[19:54:12] <[itchyjunk]> we used binary operation to be .:AxA -> A
[19:54:15] <[itchyjunk]> so closure was demanded
[19:54:19] <riv> that lets us use it on N's, even though it's not on N
[19:54:29] <riv> yeah that seems sensible
[19:54:31] <Z-module> By pretty standard usage, a function on some set X is only called a "binary operation on X" if it maps  X x X -> X
[19:54:48] <Z-module> you don't need to posit "closure" as a requirement on top. It's inherent by what the codomain is.
[19:56:03] <Simplar> What is meant by X x X ?
[19:56:14] <[itchyjunk]> cartesian product of 2 sets
[19:57:07] <trace987> [itchyjunk], Idk
[19:57:46] <[itchyjunk]> well algebra over a field is like a vector space + vector multiplication right?
[19:57:53] <[itchyjunk]> like C can be considered an algebra?

[21:09:52] <Guest1778> X = {(x,y) in R^2 | y > 0}. Show that R is NOT an affine variety.
[21:09:53] <Guest1778> My attempt:
[21:09:53] <Guest1778> Suppose X is an affine variety. Consider a polynomial f(x,y) in V(X). Then f vanishes on R^2 \ {(x,y) | y < 0}. But a nonzero polynomial over an infinite field has only finitely many roots. So we have f = 0. Consider the points (x,0) which are not contained in X and observe f(x,0) = 0. So f vanishes on (x,0). A contradiction as X must contain all
[21:09:54] <Guest1778> solutions. Thus, X is not an affine variety.
[21:09:54] <Guest1778> Compared with a solution I found: https://i.imgur.com/i8fjVuJ.png Why does this solution parameterize the f(x,y) function they wrote? Why is that needed? Note thatI wrote "X" instead of "R" for the set here.

[21:14:20] <kamil> what if all but finite are zeroes ?
[21:14:53] <cadmio> so if S is infinite to calculate span S you take only a subset of S?
[21:15:38] <Z-module> you use EVERY possible finite subset S' of S, and all possible linear combos of the things in S'  in each case
[21:19:39] <Z-module> so you get back everything in S itself at least, since for each s in S, the sum  1s   is just s, and that's a linear combo made using a finite subset (namely {s} ) of S.

[21:43:06] <Z-module> also, if S happens to be infinite, and we are over the field F, then   |Span(S)| = max{ |F|, |S| }   for cardinality. But you never need to worry about this.
[21:43:38] <Z-module> that's only if the element a is non-algebraic (= transcendental) over F
[21:43:44] <cadmio> isn't always true that given an 'a' you have that the powers are linear independt?
[21:43:59] <Z-module> right, if a is algebraic, that set is always dependent
[21:44:15] <cadmio> I need an example
[21:45:17] <Z-module> because a algebraic over F means a is the 0 of some nonzero polynomial  x^n + f_(n-1) x^(n-1) +...+ f_1 x^1 + f_0   (each f_i in F).  Thus the set  {1, a, a^2, ..., a^n}  here is dependent.  THus so is its superset {1, a, a^2, a^3, ....}

[21:46:02] <Z-module> I shouldn't have said "right".
[21:46:14] <cadmio> ah maybe if we take a= sqrt(2) then we have x^2-1 = 0 now 1 and a^2 are linearly dependent
[21:46:21] <Z-module> The set {1, a, a^2, a^3, ...} is independent over F  iff   a is non-algebraic over F.
[21:46:37] <cadmio> 1 is a^0
[21:46:54] <Z-module> yes, and even when a has no expression using radicals.
[21:47:31] <cadmio> but if 'a' is trascendental you cannot find a poly such that the powers of a are linear dependent
[21:48:09] <Z-module> For example, let z be any complex root of  x^5 - x + 1.  We can prove in more advanced ways that z has *no* expression using nth roots and rationals. Yet, still, the set  {1, z, z^5} here is dependent over Q, because  (1)z^5 + (-1)z + (1)1 = 0
[21:49:30] <cadmio> z^5-z+1 is not 0
[21:50:15] <Z-module> Right, if the base field Q and a is pi, or e, or any other transcendental number, then the set {1, a, a^2, a^3, ...} is independent over Q, so  [Q(a):Q]  is infinite (specifically it is aleph_0 ).
[21:50:57] <Z-module> The polynomial  x^5 - x + 1  does HAVE complex roots (so does every nonzero poly over C). I said let z mean any single one of those.
[21:51:09] <Z-module> That means  z^5 - z + 1 = 0.
[21:51:39] <cadmio> ok now I understand and must rewrite the proof of the corollary
[21:51:41] <Z-module> so {1, z, z^2, ....}  here is dependent, even though there is no way to write z as a finite combo of kth roots and rationals (this last fact is much more advanced).

[22:43:54] <isekaijin> Equally clearly, A \cap B = {(0, 0)} is an affine variety.
[22:44:29] <tusko> riv, I'm assuming what I need to do is (1+j) * e^(-2|t|/H) * e^j(2*pi*|t|/H) = e^(-2|t|/H) * e^j(2*pi*|t|/H) + j(e^(-2|t|/H) * e^(2*pi*|t|/H))

[22:45:35] <tusko> then I just take the square of the real part of all that to get like |e^(-2|t|/H)|^2

[22:54:02] <jbis> Hi
[22:54:22] <jbis> https://math.stackexchange.com/a/930491/606805
[22:54:36] <jbis> I tried to do the same thing for √4
[22:55:16] <isekaijin> And obviously it doesn't work because sqrt(4) = 2 is rational.
[22:55:23] <jbis> https://i.imgur.com/ywKyh8n.png
[22:55:43] <jbis> What am I doing wrong?
[22:55:57] <isekaijin> a doesn't have to have a factor of 4.
[22:56:18] <isekaijin> The proof relies critically on the fact that 3 is prime.
[22:56:33] <isekaijin> It goes from “a^2 is divisible by 3” to “a is divisible by 3” using this assumption.
[22:57:10] <jbis> Where does that come from?
[22:57:45] <isekaijin> The following is a known fact. If p is prime, and ab is divisible by p, then either a is divisible by p or b is divisible by p.
[22:57:57] *** Quits: vckt_ (~vkt____@103.136.92.19) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:58:27] <jbis> Is there a proof for that?
[22:58:44] <jbis> It's not intuitive to me
[22:58:54] <isekaijin> Take p = 6, a = 2, b = 3.
[22:59:00] <isekaijin> That's a good enough counterexample.
[22:59:08] <isekaijin> Notice that ab = 6 is clearly divisible by p = 6.
[22:59:16] <isekaijin> But neither a = 2 nor b = 2 is.
[22:59:19] <isekaijin> Errr
[22:59:21] <isekaijin> But neither a = 2 nor b = 3 is.

[23:00:01] <jbis> yes
[23:00:30] <isekaijin> But, when p is prime, you just consider the prime factorizations of a, b and ab.

[23:01:53] <isekaijin> The prime factors of ab are just the prime factors of a and b together, counted with the correct multiplicity.
[23:05:35] <jbis> Interesting

[23:56:22] <buster> Decker, depends what kind of derivative you mean. You have a function f: R³×R³→R³, and its differential Df is a linear function, also R³×R³→R³. But I don't know if that's what you want.
[23:57:10] <buster> (loosely speaking Df is a 3×6 matrix)
[23:58:36] <Decker> It's somewhat abstract; I'd think I'd like to know for some (x,y,z) original rotation, what the resulting direction is for changing {p,q,r} vector; but depending on the range of the change directionality doesn't mean a lot anyway so I don't know it would even be useful
