[01:34:24] <mst> LOL
[01:34:25] <gwern> kuudes: from the sound of it, he donated $200m but was accused of stealing only $20m
[01:34:34] <Betawolf> what's even the point of donating money if they take down your name the instant you're convicted of fraud?
[01:35:06] <kuudes> duh, pushing your values!
[01:35:26] <gwern> kuudes: so the theft likely did not optimize his long-term donations unless you imagine there was some extreme circumstance like he'd de facto gone bankrupt or failed and taking the $20m was making the best of a bad hand
[01:35:31] <Betawolf> I guess maybe he just likes the arts
[01:35:40] <gwern> otherwise it sounds like he screwed up and could've donated more if he had been in for the long haul
[01:36:00] <kuudes> he sounded like to just have got lucky because dotcom boom caused anything you threw a dart on to multiply
[01:36:28] <kuudes> so it seems to me it was possible he had no investment skill and just got lucky initially and tried to continue gambling, but managed to donate while gambling
[01:36:43] <kuudes> basicly, effective terrorist but did not suicide
[01:37:06] <kuudes> and it seems unlikely usa will bomb hermitage
[01:38:00] <gwern> kuudes: even if he had gotten lucky, tech has been booming for the past 15 years or so, I'm sure you noticed. even just sinking that lucky gains into stocks would've delivered huge returns. he obviously had at least $200m to invest total (since he gave $200m away), and 7% annually on $200m is pretty sweet...

[11:46:10] <kuudes> but yes, there is currently public discussion about the change of strategy re covid here - and it seems to be goodish discussion, as it seems the talk is actually about the crux of the question, the aims on what should be get toward, not that much over single means
[11:46:35] <kuudes> apparently ministry of health and institute of health and welfare have had disagreements in the aims
[11:47:13] <kuudes> institute is of the pov that we vaccinate those we can and call it done then, and ministry is of the pov that the situation is done only when case count drops toward 0

[13:06:14] <Robomot> Epistemic Contextualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
[13:13:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "... perhaps the first explicit statement of a “contextualist” epistemic theory by David Annis. Annis’ theory concerns justification, not knowledge, and it appeals to the subject’s context rather than the attributor’s. According Annis, while “man is a social animal…when it comes to the justification of beliefs philosophers have tended to ignore this fact” (1978, 215)—more specifically, they have tended to
[13:13:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  ignore the existence of “contextual parameters essential to justification” (ibid., 213): a person is justified in believing that p only if she can meet certain objections which express real doubts, where it makes a difference just who is expressing the latter (e.g., if the subject is being examined for an M.D. degree, it is important that the objector occupy the appropriate institutional role)."
[13:14:31] <saturn2> so that's what it's called
[13:14:53] <Gurkenglas> I hear drinking too much water at once will make the body discard most of it, because if the blood gets diluted enough, cells swell by osmosis. Does this scale down to the point where you can reduce required everyday hydration by having more stuff dissolved in the drinking water?
[13:15:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: But you can in fact die from drinking too much water
[13:15:50] <Gurkenglas> Sure, presumably discarding water isn't trivial, but that wasn't the question
[13:15:58] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: yes, that is how sports drinks and pedialyte work
[13:16:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: No that's just, like, a precursor view
[13:16:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> "epistemic contextualism" is something else, which I'm still reading my way up to
[13:16:28] <saturn2> oh wow
[13:17:20] <nshepperd> more advanced insanity
[13:17:38] <Gurkenglas> Hmm, there's a bunch of calories in those. Shouldn't the same principle work with something inert?
[13:18:13] <vrs> hmm this seems roughly correct but they could've made the introduction a third as long
[13:18:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "EC is roughly the view that what is expressed by a knowledge attribution — a claim to the effect that S “knows” that p — depends partly on something in the context of the attributor, and hence the view is often called ‘attributor contextualism’. Because such an utterance is context-dependent, so too is whether the attribution is true. The typical EC view identifies the pivotal contextual features as the attributor
[13:18:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> ’s practical stake in the truth of p, or the prominence in the attributor’s situation of skeptical doubts about knowledge. The typical EC view has it that as the stakes rise or the skeptical doubts become more serious, the contextual standard gets more demanding. It requires S to be in a better position if the attributor’s claim, “S knows that p”, is to express a truth. In contrast, Invariantists about knowledge hold
[13:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  that such factors in the attributor’s context do not affect the standards that must be met by a true “knowledge” attribution."
[13:18:44] <vrs> "all models are wrong, some are useful" except for epistemics
[13:18:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> This seems like very advanced insanity and I do not get how anyone could possibly justify anything like this
[13:19:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I guess I'll find that out somewhere down this page
[13:19:12] <vrs> it's common sense, it's just sold very badly
[13:19:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it???
[13:20:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> How can whether you do or don't know something, depend on any property of me, a person who is describing you as knowing or not knowing that thing
[13:20:04] <vrs> you're familiar with "strong beliefs, weakly held"? this is kind of like it
[13:20:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have no idea how you are coming up with that connection
[13:21:07] <vrs> if I care about the results, I apply more rigorous standards than when I don't. this is what it says
[13:21:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, let's be specific: say there's a proposition P. Bob says, "Alice knows that P is true." Carol says, "Alice does not know that P is true."
[13:22:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> And according to EC, Bob and Carol could both be right.
[13:22:12] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: i think the glucose increases water retention even more, but it still works without it
[13:22:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> You think this is common sense?
[13:22:58] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, please don't kill or maim yourself by stopping to ingest water
[13:23:10] <vrs> with the information provided yes, though my first action would be to get more context so that I don't have to rely on what bob and carol say
[13:24:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I confess that I can't imagine how this could possibly be true, much less "common sense"
[13:24:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can you think of an example
[13:24:27] <nshepperd> Gurkenglas: standard oral rehydration solutions (for treating severe dehydration) include glucose, usually 1:1 with salt because that is part of the osmotic balance that your body cares about
[13:24:35] <PlanckWalk> It's nothing more than "words have meanings that vary with context.  'Knows" is no different".
[13:24:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Nor do I see the connection with "all models..." and "weakly held..." etc.)
[13:25:01] <vrs> ok so you've independently measured the speed of light from first principles with instruments you built yourself starting with clay and twigs?
[13:25:02] <nshepperd> it doesn't need to contain a lot of calories
[13:25:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: I really don't think that's it but I can't be sure
[13:25:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> vrs: I have not. What follows from this?
[13:25:30] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, i do have enough of a scorecard left in my midbrain that i drink lots of water. but i do also pee a lot while at home. i don't know whether this exhibits a preference cycle or a useful process that happens to require lots of water cycling.
[13:25:36] <vrs> the thing that follows is that you take a lot of things on faith
[13:26:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, true for some value of "faith", but let's take that for granted right now, but what of it?
[13:26:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> How does EC follow
[13:26:28] <Gurkenglas> What's the usual way to help the midbrain's scorecard? A blood test for micronutrient levels would be one part of it, I suppose.
[13:27:33] <vrs> EC says that most knowledge is acquired through intermediates and then carefully checked for usefulness logical consistency so that you know nobody's bullshitting you, especially when it matters to you
[13:27:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh
[13:27:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's clearly not what EC says
[13:27:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't see that what you just said has anything whatsoever to do with what EC says
[13:28:19] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: what if you only drink oral rehydration solutions instead of water
[13:28:28] <vrs> I could spell it out for you but I have things to do
[13:28:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well ok
[13:28:42] <nshepperd> PapuaHardyNet: idk what would happen if you did that
[13:28:48] <nshepperd> you'd probably be ok i guess
[13:29:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> vrs: I'm still reading this SEP page but so far, I do not see any hint of your interpretation in here... will report back after more reading I suppose
[13:29:06] <saturn2> you'd increase your risk of kidney stones
[13:29:17] <nshepperd> EC just seems putting a fresh coat of paint on linguistic relativism and selling it as any kind of relativism that matters
[13:29:18] <PapuaHardyNet> kidney stones? why is that?
[13:29:54] <Gurkenglas> vrs, is this related to "i'd rather bet against nature than against someone who suggested a bet to me"?
[13:30:15] <nshepperd> just because Alice and Bob can have different opinions on what the word 'knowledge' means doesn't mean knowledge itself is relative
[13:30:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man you guys are making some real leaps here (other than nshepperd)
[13:30:31] <nshepperd> that's a classic finger pointing at the moon fallacy
[13:30:33] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: oral rehydration solutions contain dissolved solids
[13:30:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although I am not sure that nshepperd has it right either)
[13:31:15] <nshepperd> eheh
[13:31:46] <vrs> Gurkenglas: hmm the latter kind of implies the someone is out to trick you?
[13:31:51] <vrs> not sure
[13:32:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh
[13:32:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I take that back
[13:33:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd has it exactly right
[13:33:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the other characterizations given so far are wrong
[13:33:12] <saturn2> how does the attributor know the context, then, without a second attributor to provide context to the first, and so on forever?
[13:33:13] <nshepperd> :)
[13:33:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Section 2: Further Clarifications, makes this very clear
[13:33:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Irrelevant because as nshepperd said, this is just about "what do you mean by 'knowledge'"
[13:33:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Boring
[13:33:51] <Gurkenglas> vrs, yeah, if i happen to find in the world an opportunity that my model says is 60/40 likely to double my 1k$, i'd rather take it than in the case where my model is public and someone approaches me with a bet i think is 60/40

[13:34:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "EC, then, is an _epistemological_ theory because, and only because, it concerns sentences using ‘knowledge’ and kindred expressions, as oppose to those employing non-epistemic terms; it is not a theory _about_ any epistemic property or relation itself. Nonetheless, as we will see, when various proponents of EC flesh out their preferred version of the views, the differences among the resulting theories mirror some major
[13:34:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  lines of division among leading theories of knowledge." ... lol come on
[13:35:39] <vrs> linguistic relativism is bullshit because most people (and essentially all animals) don't think in language, but regardless, knowledge is not absolute, it just looks like this a bit when you're dealing with physical reality
[13:35:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is the philosophy-department version of the thing where you mention "national security on the blockchain" in your grant proposal even though you're studying emoji use on 4chan
[13:36:00] <Gurkenglas> maybe the confusion here is that the world is real, everyone's model is in a brain that's real, but different heuristics are better for modeling both
[13:36:23] <vrs> as far as I can tell, EC uses a notion of knowledge meaning roughly "model that is useful to you"

[13:42:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> vrs: ... how
[13:42:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> vrs: Wait no, actually that's definitely wrong
[13:43:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> vrs: Says so right here in section 3
[13:43:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whatever EC is, it's definitely pretty much the opposite of a theory of what we do in practice etc.:
[13:43:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "As its proponents generally admit, EC is something that one needs to be argued into: it takes _work_ to come to think, for example, that there can be situations in which we have two subjects, exactly alike psychologically, possessing the very same history and the same evidence with regard to p, etc., with respect to only one of whom ‘S knows that p’ expresses a truth: we seem, if anything, to be intuitive Invariantists.[5
[13:43:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> ] As one leading contextualist says, many resist the contextualist thesis, and “those who do accept [it] generally do so only as a result of being convinced by philosophical reflection” (Cohen 1999, 78)."
[13:44:08] <saturn2> this article seems really boring, what's the point of this?
[13:44:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno. It seemed weird and crazy at first. Now I think it's just boring philosophical grant-making
[13:44:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess that's the point
[13:44:41] <saturn2> oh okay
[13:44:43] <Gurkenglas> for example, imagine there's a smart contract that pays out 1$ iff its price is less than 50 ct by midnight. then using a point estimate for the price and for the payout and enforcing both dependencies will give you a bad time
[13:44:51] * Obormot\Arcturus closes the tab
[13:46:38] <vrs> Obormot\Arcturus: you need to be argued into the view that EC is what you do in practice, even if you already do it
[13:46:45] <vrs> that's what that paragraph says
[13:46:54] <PlanckWalk> In part, it looks like a crappy ad-hoc way to deal with degrees of belief and relationships between them.
[13:47:04] <PlanckWalk> (While pretending that it's still binary but context-dependent)
[13:47:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> vrs: I... don't see how it says that
[13:48:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: No, I don't think so; see the paragraph I just quoted: "two subjects, exactly alike psychologically, possessing the very same history and the same evidence with regard to p, etc." - so it's not about degrees of belief and differences between them...
[13:49:58] <PlanckWalk> Good point
[13:50:57] <PlanckWalk> I was thinking of degree of belief of two different people considering the proposition "A1 knows p" and "A2 knows p" though.
[13:52:02] <PlanckWalk> If P1 has a stringent context, they might mean more by "knows" than P2 in a less stringent context.
[13:52:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, a lot of this "knowledge" and "attribution of knowledge" stuff is easily cut through by probabilistic reasoning, degrees of belief, etc.
[13:52:55] <PlanckWalk> E.g. a high school teacher might say "Robert knows that there are infinitely many primes", and just mean "they were told, have reason to believe it, and answered correctly on a test"
[13:53:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gettier cases, the "skeptical puzzle" given on the SEP page about EC, etc.
[13:54:10] <PlanckWalk> A university lecturer might mean "Robert knows how to prove it informally, and can translate it and derive it in three different formal systems"
[13:54:22] <Gurkenglas> PlanckWalk, that doesnt seem like it'll lead to any interesting/useful math, *exactly* like arguments about definitions are silly
[13:54:43] <PlanckWalk> That's what I *think* this EC thing is referring to

[13:55:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like "here's a puzzle; the possible answers are X, Y, or Z; but they're all bad, right??" and imo, no, one of them is the answer, the end
[13:55:57] <saturn2> ok i just got to the "skeptical puzzle" and it's not a puzzle
[13:56:17] <PlanckWalk> That one really does just look like degree of belief.
[13:56:27] <nshepperd2> lol yeah
[13:56:30] <Gurkenglas> Is there any place where we can comment "Isn't this just 'people mean different things by the same words'?" and like, make them not get grant money
[13:56:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, the "closure" thing is just wrong
[13:56:36] <nshepperd2> the skeptical non-puzzle
[13:57:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> My suspicion remains that this is all philosophical grant-making
[13:57:24] <kuudes> I agree with saturn2's questioning the usefulness of this discussions
[13:57:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of a fairly weak caliber
[13:57:36] <saturn2> wow this is super, super dumb
[13:57:37] <kuudes> someone is wrong in philosophy somewhere, what is the point to us
[13:57:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Well, we're pretty much done
[13:59:43] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, the skeptical puzzle just looks like amphiboly.
[13:59:54] <vrs> hmm the puzzle seems ill-posed, on one hand you have a statement C with an explicit context P1 and P2, on the other you have the same statement expressed in a completely different, namely intuitive context
[13:59:58] <nshepperd2> a different example of what i think they're talking about would be like, someone at a geology symposium saying "we know what water is" and then going to a string theory symposium and saying "we don't know what water is"
[14:00:09] <vrs> those words say different things in different contexts? surprise!
[14:00:24] <nshepperd2> latter has a different standard of where to draw the linguistic line
[14:00:43] <nshepperd2> but it's all just degrees of belief and probabilistic models really
[14:01:04] <PlanckWalk> P1 uses "know" to mean P(h) > 0.  P2 uses P(p) <= P(~h) to derive C: P(p) < 1.
[14:01:20] <PlanckWalk> ... and so?  P(p) < 1  for essentially everything.
[14:01:42] <Gurkenglas> does anyone use markets yet to make grant decisions?
[14:01:57] <PlanckWalk> And this is "surprising" if you also use "know" to mean something like P(p) > 0.99
[14:02:34] <Obormot\Gaia> PlanckWalk: "P1 uses "know" to mean P(h) > 0" - no I think you miss a negation somewhere in the text
[14:03:18] <Obormot\Gaia> It's more like, P1 uses "don't know that ~h" to mean "P(h) > 0"
[14:03:23] <PlanckWalk> Obormot\Gaia: I did a bit of arithmetic.  "I don’t know that not-h" => P(not-h) < 1
[14:03:29] <PlanckWalk> So P(h) > 0
[14:03:53] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, better off to just use not-h throughout
[14:04:07] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway ok I think we solved this, guys
[14:04:10] <nshepperd2> you can't just move modal quantifiers around like that
[14:04:12] <nshepperd2> gosh
[14:04:26] <Gurkenglas> would anyone like to bet on how much longer we'll stay on this topic
[14:04:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[14:04:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's obvious incentive to fix that market
[14:05:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's actually a great example of why insistence on betting as the universal acid of epistemology is wrongheaded :p
[14:05:26] <PlanckWalk> I'd be more inclined to bet on how long some thing in nature woudl stay on that topic
[14:05:43] <Gurkenglas> we could assume that anyone continuing to talk about this topic is fixing a market and should be kicked.
[14:05:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> (NARRATOR: But then it turned out... that they were *all* "things in nature"!)
[14:06:03] <nshepperd2> how long does the average polar bear think about epistemology during its lifetime
[14:06:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Dun dun DUNNNN)
[14:06:09] <PlanckWalk> *shocked pikachu*
[14:06:51] <PlanckWalk> nshepperd2: ... and how does that affect anthropic probaiblity of being a polar bear given that one is thinking about epistemology?
[14:07:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Instead let's talk about how amazing acupressure pads are. Have I mentioned these things before? Because thet're awesome
[14:08:19] <PlanckWalk> I don't recall you mentioning them before.  What are they awesome for?
[14:08:46] <saturn2> what do they do?
[14:08:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Any kind of muscle pain
[14:09:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or tension
[14:09:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Tension headaches too
[14:09:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically it's just like a soft-ish mat and one side is studded with little plastic spikes
[14:09:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> You lie on it

[14:10:36] <saturn2> so it's a bed of nails, but with plastic nails
[14:10:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[14:10:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> 100% less risk of tetanus :p
[14:11:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also much more portable and much less likely to set off metal detectors
[14:11:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pretty much win-win
[14:11:39] <nshepperd2> and... it works?
[14:11:40] <saturn2> cool
[14:11:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yeah it works great
[14:12:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Back pain (the kind that comes from muscle issues, anyway, I doubt this would do anything for like a pinched nerve or verterbral disks etc.) ... tension headaches, like I said...
[14:13:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Feels great, too
[14:13:47] <Gurkenglas> Obormot, wikipedia interacts ~badly with AKS (would you like to unsubscribe from this report?)
[14:13:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> This Amazon product description says to wear a t-shirt when lying down on it but uh... that's dumb
[14:14:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's obviously gotta be touching skin, also what kinda pansy do you have to be for tiny plastic spikes to require a t-shirt to protect you from them :\
[14:15:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: No, the reports are welcome, but... why are you using AKS on WP? I didn't think WP even has stickies?
[14:15:35] <Gurkenglas> does in germany!
[14:15:42] <PapuaHardyNet> do you mean the top banner?

[14:16:00] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas, please try ublock origin
[14:16:15] <Gurkenglas> oh yeah that was temporarily unable to add new filters, should be fine then
[14:16:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Yeah I dunno man, I am aware of the WP issue but... it's not an easy fix, sorry :\

[14:20:58] <Robomot> Aku Mat | Acupressure Mat  – Akuspike Products Inc. (The Aku Mat is based on the principles of acupressure and reflexology and works on the premise that tiny metal spikes stimulate active nerve centers to increase blood flow and lymph circulation. This reduces inflammation while triggering the release of endorphins. Endorphins are known as the feel-good neurotransmitters)
[14:21:27] <Gurkenglas> coulda just said "this reduces inflammation while trigger feel-good"
[14:22:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't suggest taking all these manufacturers' product ad copy too seriously
[14:22:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> They have to write something that sounds good
[14:22:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably at least half of it is bullshit
[14:22:57] <Gurkenglas> what if we subsidized nonbullshit ads
[14:23:29] <nshepperd2> that would just cause more ads
[14:23:33] <Gurkenglas> what if we tax ads
[14:24:43] <saturn2> sadly i'm not a lord with the power to tax things unilaterally
[14:25:07] <Gurkenglas> mint a coin, give it to everyone according to how much money you think they should have

[14:30:32] <PapuaHardyNet> proof-of-work is the number of people who click on the button "yes I love this ad!"
[14:30:47] <Gurkenglas> too much effort? publicly state that any power you eventually have will be used to help who you think deserves it, and that if people write "that which saturn2 thinks i deserve" on a piece of paper and trade it around you'll honor that.
[14:33:41] <nshepperd> squint.jpg
[14:34:03] <saturn2> lol
[14:35:29] <Gurkenglas> at this rate ill be able to ctrl-f gpt-4's output for "<nshepperd> squint.jpg" to find good ideas
[14:49:19] <Gurkenglas> how likely is there to be a cryptocoin design that takes over the economy, into which one could put constructions like "stop anyone except the richest entity from playing with the world's fate"?
[14:50:40] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, CFAR's 2019 Handbook is surprisingly useful
[14:50:56] <PapuaHardyNet> on that note, I wonder if alkjash ever frequented #lesswrong
[14:52:36] <saturn2> not that i'm aware of
[14:57:46] <Gurkenglas> there's this set {diplomacy, crypto, nanotech, ai, biotech} of ways to take over the world in increasing order of danger to the world when toyed with, and crypto seems underexplored for the purpose of saving it
[14:58:26] <PapuaHardyNet> you think crypto can be used to save the world? hah
[14:59:10] <Gurkenglas> Perhaps! Imagine 80% of the world's money was allocated effectively.
[14:59:45] <PapuaHardyNet> well, okay. decentralized cryptocurrency has shown an immense ability to shift markets and change the fate of civilizations.
[15:00:09] <Gurkenglas> Sarcasm?
[15:00:22] <PapuaHardyNet> not this time
[15:01:03] <PapuaHardyNet> see, the problem is that "saving the world" involves creating an open loop system, one where you are tracking variables outside the network. With proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, all the variables are part of the system itself
[15:01:53] <PapuaHardyNet> making robust open loop systems that aren't defeated by red teamers (because that is the first thing people will try to do) is extremely difficult
[15:02:33] <PapuaHardyNet> in that sense, this is equivalent to the AI alignment problem
[15:02:41] *** Quits: bildramer (~bildramer@2a02:587:620c:d300:cfb5:f573:c39a:c618) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[15:02:45] <PapuaHardyNet> where the AI is a decentralized network of people and their computation
[15:03:08] <Gurkenglas> the trick is to set it up so "someone coordinates a 51% attack" requires enough cooperation that this is mission accomplished
[15:03:51] <PapuaHardyNet> no, people will only focus on byzantine faults when they cannot leverage easier weaknesses in the system
[15:04:26] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps I am missing out on some steps in your logic that you haven't made explicit
[15:04:58] <Gurkenglas> I agree that regular security exploits that can be done by anyone who's smart enough make crypto more dangerous than diplomacy
[15:05:23] <Gurkenglas> But less dangerous than the other three! And at least this time we're operating on familiar territory
[15:07:48] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: I'm curious; do you agree that the AI alignment problem is the same problem one needs to solve to align the interests of miners of a cryptocurrency with humanity?
[15:08:13] <Gurkenglas> no. miners are human
[15:08:44] <nshepperd> using crypto to get rich then saving the world the boring way, using money, seems more practical
[15:09:13] <nshepperd> not that trillion dollar lottery tickets are that easy to write either
[15:10:25] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd, that doesnt sound like it would stop more and more entities from playing with the world's fate as our tech level advances
[15:10:46] <Gurkenglas> I'm suggesting to construct https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Otolmens out of markets
[15:10:47] <Robomot> Otolmens - PathfinderWiki
[15:11:06] <nshepperd> well duh you need to do world domination to stop that
[15:11:35] <Gurkenglas> Right and I'm playing with the specifics of what exactly world domination means, here
[15:11:35] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: Take a look at the Ethereum decentralized "computer". Now imagine that, except instead of a computer running smart contracts, it is an AI
[15:12:11] <PapuaHardyNet> this is orthogonal to my idea of modelling both computation and miners together as AI, of course, but this is also worth considering
[15:12:43] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, the intelligence here isn't in the computer, it's in the people
[15:13:24] <PapuaHardyNet> sure. my point is that you have proof-of-X, where X is bettering humanity. Correct?
[15:13:38] <PapuaHardyNet> and the more someone "betters humanity", the more resources are given to them
[15:13:58] <Gurkenglas> no that sounds like it would be abused
[15:15:39] <PapuaHardyNet> ugh, and that's what I thought you had in mind
[15:16:01] <Gurkenglas> although hmm, i guess what i have in mind is after all equivalent to what you say
[15:16:36] <Gurkenglas> if we buy gpus in order to lengthen the world lifespan someone could endanger the world in order to get bought out
[15:17:58] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting. But if you take that into consideration as part of X, then murdering such a person would increase X, and therefore benefit the murderers
[15:18:07] <PapuaHardyNet> thought-crime!
[15:18:58] <PapuaHardyNet> (by this I mean you, Gurkenglas, will be paid in cryptocurrency to murder or disable me, Papua, if I decide to hold the world or a part of the world hostage)
[15:19:23] <Gurkenglas> i mean i am already incentivized to murder or disable you in that circumstance
[15:19:35] <PapuaHardyNet> ugh, do-gooders
[15:19:35] <Gurkenglas> although, bystander effect.
[15:20:02] <PapuaHardyNet> which means this is an alignment problem. 
[15:20:14] <Gurkenglas> ehh?
[15:21:10] <Gurkenglas> any market on whether the world is in danger is an assassination market on the world and anyone who endangers it.
[15:21:18] <saturn2> it's very unlikely that there is a cryptocoin design that takes over the economy, into which one could put constructions like "stop anyone except the richest entity from playing with the world's fate"
[15:21:46] <PapuaHardyNet> (we should have a bot that automatically disagrees with Gurkenglas like saturn has just done)
[15:22:05] <saturn2> that would save me some typing
[15:22:07] <Gurkenglas> fine so long as im allowed to bet against it
[15:22:26] <PapuaHardyNet> back on topic: how will you ensure that people cannot take advantage of proof-of-X to enrich themselves?
[15:22:40] <PapuaHardyNet> if proof-of-X is less than omnipotent and omniscient, it can be fooled
[15:22:54] <PapuaHardyNet> this means proof-of-X evaluator can be modelled as an AGI
[15:23:07] <Gurkenglas> you mean, enrich themselves by producing proof-of-X instead of X?
[15:23:13] <PapuaHardyNet> that's right!
[15:23:59] <Gurkenglas> Augur has an oracle mechanism, do you also distrust it?
[15:25:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I haven't used Augur, so I cannot comment on it
[15:27:49] <saturn2> as long as there are humans around, they're going to have power relationships with each other, which will determine their primary motivations. money always follows from that, rather than vice versa
[15:28:13] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, Augur: someone can claim "P" by staking money on it. Anyone can stake more money against. This continues as a poker game until one side folds or almost all money is staked. Then the chain forks and in each side, one side wins. Then, presumably, the version of the coin where the claim is invalid is worthless.
[15:29:38] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. okay, so according to this model, people decide in a decentralized fashion whether what a person did was proof-of-X or not
[15:30:10] <PapuaHardyNet> that means there's no real benefit to actually adopting such a crypto
[15:30:29] <PapuaHardyNet> since the consensus mechanism relies on people and their faulty nature.
[15:30:31] <Gurkenglas> Indeed! There is no real benefit required. All we need to do is act like dath ilan.
[15:32:00] <Gurkenglas> And the idea is that while diplomacy has no free energy, crypto has a way of memetically taking over the world that could make us a civilization that can survive the coming storm.
[15:32:49] <Gurkenglas> Indeed, perhaps the system should be ultimately designed to not rely on unproven cryptographic theorems at all, for the top stakes
[15:35:08] <Gurkenglas> (although i guess there could be a graceful transition system designed in, in case whoever cracks the cryptography likes the fact that there is an Otolmens.)

[15:40:27] <Gurkenglas> otolmenscoin is minted by otolmens. he decides who has how much money. he lets you transfer it like any other token, but when he judges that you have forsaken him then he takes away his gifts.
[15:43:27] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, it won't work irl. pre-mined coins never took off, because people didn't consider it would continue to have worth and worried there would be a pump and dump. coins that aren't premined but held largely by one party, like XRP, are also thought of as less legit as compared to more distributed coins.
[15:43:54] <PapuaHardyNet> s/held largely/created only and distributed largely/
[15:44:27] <Gurkenglas> the manner in which otolmenscoin disappears also works if he didn't premint it.
[15:45:09] <PapuaHardyNet> nah man, I don't understand what you are saying, and I'm still skeptical that this idea has weight
[15:47:48] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, let's try again: Consider a cryptocurrency that has as a fundamental feature that when the markets judge that destroying coin #526426853 will increase the world's chances of survival by >p, it is destroyed.
[15:49:00] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, go on
[15:55:29] <Gurkenglas> you add whatever features are required for it to manage most of the world's money, suddenly OpenAI finds that people that hold otolmenscoin, when trading with OpenAI, require more favorable terms, to offset the risk of being smitten. OpenAI finds that the terms go back to normal when it itself switches to otolmenscoin because everyone knows openai would be smitten before the people trading with it.
[15:56:47] <Gurkenglas> openai does this because it's also a generally good pr move to go "if the markets ever judge that we threaten the world, we'll automatically go bankrupt"

[22:10:15] <gwern> I used zotero for a while with wikipedia because wikipedia's citation formats are so baroque and hard to use, but with gwern.net, I don't use anything more complex than '[Foo et al 2021](/docs/2021-foo.pdf)': I lean completely into 'fuck copyright & citation formats', so like 70% of zotero is outright liabilities for me

[23:12:17] <gwern> it's the usual littlewood thing. is assigning a DOI to a banana you're selling insane? yes. but there's someone out there out of 8 billion humans worldwide who is going 'I need an ID, this is an ID... yessss.'
[23:12:53] <pompolic> the endgame of identity politics?
[23:13:07] <pompolic> ...i'm not sure i'm actually shitposting
[23:13:35] <pompolic> maybe this is a psychology, that needs a symbolic identifier for everything
[23:17:17] <pompolic> also: i did enjoy that aspect of Smalltalk -- everything is a message. i can see it becoming a huge headache in larger applications though
[23:20:52] <shawwwn> gwern: well, how do I get one?
[23:21:49] <gwern> shawwwn: you have to find an org signed up with DOI, and they will give you a DOI inside their own namespace. unfortunately, there's not really any 'free' generic DOI source, because apparently they cost like $1 each so orgs don't hand them out like candy
[23:22:04] <shawwwn> I'd pay $1 for a doi
[23:22:14] <gwern> I looked into it for gwern.net and didn't find any good solutions
[23:22:23] <pompolic> how do you get a DOI namespace?
[23:22:31] <gwern> pompolic: sign up and pay a few thousand dollars, iirc
[23:22:44] * pompolic files this away to the databanks
[23:23:11] <gwern> plus of course if you make any real use of the DOI address and you're getting DOIs from a third-party, that third-party now controls your domain name, in essence
[23:23:26] <gwern> they can repoint your links anywhere they want. (that's the whole point)
[23:23:43] <pompolic> centralized naming of things strikes again
[23:24:19] <gwern> since I managed to get my pages into google scholar with just regular metadata, and I maintain stable short URLs, I decided that DOIs basically do nothing of any value for me. they are fancy and look academic, but I can't figure out what they do for me beyond windowdressing
[23:25:05] <pompolic> yeah, i don't see use for it beyond being part of that particular network
[23:25:09] <pompolic> it's just interesting to know
[23:25:23] <gwern> it's worth noting that many organizations and people find no particular need for DOIs. for example, Arxiv pointedly has none
[23:26:02] <pompolic> i feel like they kind of compete with URLs

[23:26:51] <gwern> they're a kind of URI but maintained by a third-party in perpetuity (they hope)
[23:27:54] <gwern> as WP puts it:   'A DOI aims to be "resolvable", usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL, indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to identify their...
[23:28:00] <gwern> ...referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata. The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the...
[23:28:06] <gwern> ...metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.[4][5][6] It is the publisher's responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier

[23:28:18] <gwern> ie they're like an ISBN but for digital documents in general with a bonus that they will (hopefully) take you directly to the actual document itself

[23:30:57] <vrs> so if you wanna be part of that dataset?
[23:31:22] <gwern> scihub uses DOI if available but they don't *need* it
[23:32:17] <gwern> it would be absurd to *mandate* DOIs. DOIs haven't even existed more than 21 years or so, and while some publishers assign DOIs to their entire backcatalogue, most do not
[23:32:39] <gwern> (such as 'all the ones who no longer exist')
[23:33:21] <pompolic> DOI for all the DOI issuers that did not issue a DOI for themselves
[23:33:33] <pompolic> or however that paradox would translate
[23:34:04] <gwern> that would be tricky. remember the per-DOI fee is apparently something like $1
[23:34:14] <adiabatic> yeah, I hear DOIs are a scam
[23:35:01] <gwern> I get some use out of them. DOIs are much more accurate in sci-hub/google-scholar/crossref lookups. I theorize that google scholar surfaces my PDFs much faster if they have a correct DOI in their metadata too
[23:35:35] <rsaarelm> I like them, I started collecting some bibliography stuff and identify things by DOI whenever one is available.
[23:36:01] <rsaarelm> Hard to know what to use for an URI for obscure old journal articles that don't have a DOI.
[23:36:41] <rsaarelm> Still haven't looked whether there's any reliable service to scrape bibtex style extra metadata given a doi.
[23:37:11] <pompolic> every so often i make an attempt to organize my PDFs using zotero, but i haven't run into relevant limitations yet
[23:37:17] <pompolic> (because i don't get very far)
[23:37:33] <gwern> rsaarelm: crossref sometimes provides it. there's some R libraries I use to pull from various sources like pubmed
[23:37:42] <pompolic> whoa
[23:38:36] <gwern> rsaarelm: so for crossref, 'curl -s -L 'https://api.crossref.org/works/'"$DOI" | jq .message.abstract' sometimes returns the abstract. for the metadata in general, '.message.title, .message.author, .message.issued, .message.DOI, .message.abstract'
[23:39:52] <gwern> rsaarelm: my reliable URI for obscure old journal articles is '/docs/$SUBJECT/$YEAR-$SURNAME.pdf' :)
[23:40:25] <rsaarelm> My pdf organization: Everything's in git-annex, with arbitrary topic folders like /sci/, /math/, /lit/, article pdf names are bibliography slugs Lastname1984Word.pdf where Lastname is from first listed author and Word is random word from title.

[23:58:45] <feepbot> <gwern> 'A Toronto artificial intelligence startup, backed by some of the leading experts in the field globally, has raised US$40-million as it prepares to formally launch its technology to help make it easier for humans to talk to machines. Cohere Inc., co-founded by protégés of AI luminaries Geoffrey Hinton and Jeff Dean, said the funding was led by Index Ventures, a venture
[23:58:45] <feepbot> firm with headquarters in London and San Francisco that has also backed Slack Technologies Inc., Sonos Inc., Robinhood Markets Inc., and Etsy Inc. Other investors include venture capital firms Section 32 and Toronto’s Radical Ventures which wrote the original cheque to fund Cohere and renowned AI experts including Mr. Hinton, Fei-Fei Li, Pieter Abbeel and Raquel Urtasun...The
[23:58:45] <feepbot> startup says its natural language processing (NLP) software provides a richer understanding of human language, including semantics, sentiments and tone. As such, it improves on existing software that powers machine-human interactions such as online conversations between consumers and customer service chatbots. The idea is to provide the same quality of NLP models to a wide array of
[23:58:50] <feepbot> customers that only a handful of internet giants currently use.
