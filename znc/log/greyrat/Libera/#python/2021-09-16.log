[04:19:38] <matsaman> Macuser: what makes you think it wouldn't add a duplicate?
[04:19:53] <cluelessperson> Macuser, there are two writes,  but also I'd clean that up into cleaner code blocks. :P
[04:20:03] * cluelessperson will bbs
[04:20:18] <Macuser> the second write covers the last chunk of textfile
[04:20:43] <Macuser> had to add it because n+1 gives index error
[04:20:43] *** Joins: mukul (~mukul@c-24-6-109-135.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[04:21:16] <Macuser> matsaman it shouldn't add a duplicate because I have a list that keeps adding every line between two titles. Once a 2nd title line is reached the list is emptied into outfile and then reset to []
[04:21:46] <Macuser> the dup is really strange. it only occurs once or twice and gets doubled a few times randomly in the file. can't find any pattern to it

[04:26:33] <Repiphany> You should ideally split your code up into functions that describe what's actually being done and why
[04:27:07] <Macuser> yeah I'm terrible about that. I haven't been making functions
[04:27:36] <Macuser> usually I do add comments, but haven't yet

[11:39:11] <Samian> what word do you use to mean how many many columns there are in a 2d table? The "column column" ? Column length? column size?
[11:40:09] <supakeen> Column count, row count.
[11:40:57] <Samian> cool. that's the terminology I used too
[11:42:21] <Samian> which do you prefer? if type(foo) == list:  print("bar")
[11:42:40] <Samian> if isinstance(foo, list): print("bar")
[11:44:20] <jinsun> both don't do the same thing, you want isinstance most of the time
[11:44:45] <jinsun> so that passing a subclass also works
[11:46:02] <Samian> just read that online
[11:46:10] <Samian> isinstance will work when subclassing
[11:46:28] <Samian> the results are different for derived classes
[11:50:55] <Samian> Let's say I have a loop. An array is generated somewhere in the loop. I want to check if the array generated is identical to the array generated during the previous loop iteration.   In c++ this would be very easy.   static int counter = 0; static std::vector temp; if (counter++ > 0)  { if (temp != generated_vector) {std::cout<<"vector changed!"} temp = generated_vector;
[11:51:14] <Samian> But in python, I can't have static variables :-(

[12:23:36] <Samian> the issue with placing the function outside the loop is that code relevant to a particular chunk of code is far away from the code it's relevant to.  I like proximity to follow relevance
[12:24:55] <audio> vorap, i don't know what to set this as
[12:25:13] <audio> i guess it can be anything?
[12:25:14] <Samian> If I have 5 lines of code. I don't want a line critical to those 5 lines being far away somewhere else.   That also screws with what you know you need to be aware about.  If the code style is that everything relevant is close, you know what's relevant is in front of your eyes. You don't have to wonder whether something out of sight is impacting what is in sight.
[12:25:19] <vorap> The path that you want the file to have *inside* the zip file

[12:26:15] <audio> do i just make the arcname the filename? vorap
[12:26:19] <vorap> Everytime you write a file, you provide the name/path inside the zipfile
[12:26:31] <audio> ah i see

[13:52:03] <shangxiao> braxas: just fyi annotations in Java work differently to the @ things in python - decorators. they decorator methods, class & functions but not attributes or variables
[13:52:38] <braxas> yes I know, by annotation I meant it in the colloquial sense
[13:53:08] <rendar> braxas, point is, you cannot apply a decorator to a class field (attribute), but only to a class method, right?
[13:54:54] <shangxiao> yeah so if you want to apply some directive to an attribute, it has to be done by other means. Django does this using an inner class called "Meta" where you can say which fields are unique, etc
[13:55:14] <shangxiao> and via meta classes

[16:51:08] <zamba> i've written a small client with anyio and trio.. but the problem is that it's slow.. i'm implementing a protocol that should send a packet to "open" for a stream of data to flow.. then for each received packet i need to parse the header and the decapsulate the data..
[16:51:21] <zamba> i'm only able to do this at around 50 Mbps line speed
[16:51:38] <zamba> and i believe it's stuff like this that slows it down: header = await buffered.receive_exactly(2)
[16:52:11] <zamba> tmdata_header = await buffered.receive_exactly(22) ; frame_size = int.from_bytes(tmdata_header[10:12], "big") ; data = await buffered.receive_exactly(frame_size)

[16:59:59] <u4t> can probably be neatened up a bit though
[17:00:37] <u4t> if your decorator function is called line(), then it doesn't need to know that the chart type=="line"

[17:04:28] <pycode> i admit the "encapsulate" term is may not correct here in that context :D
[17:05:13] <grawity> a decorator can certainly call another decorator and just return its result... not sure offhand how to do it with decorators which take parameters, though, but it should be very possible

[18:44:06] <Penagwin> stealth_ I'm not sure what you mean, as far as I can tell the state is being nuked between worker requests
[18:44:09] <foo> Is it safe to assume not every python project needs to be designed as if it was packagable. Or would you say, as a general rule of thumb, it's best to always design a package with the structure as if it was a standalone packagable app?

[19:31:05] <aidanhasaknife> Hi! Python newbie + first time using an IRC... looking for some help with truth value testing / truthiness and falsiness. See this code if you're willing to help, thanks! :) https://bpa.st/KWDA

[19:33:03] <supakeen> auri: `== True` is a direct comparison with True, not evaluating the list as a boolean.
[19:33:11] <rounda> merge sort: https://bpa.st/F2IQ  I dont understand why it is represented as recursing down a tree, operating on individual "leafs,"  then rebuilding the array back up. All I see is dividinng the array in half, then using pointers to compare half of the half-array being operated on. The visual representations in the book made it extremely difficult
[19:33:11] <rounda> to code up without using the psuedocode
[19:33:14] <supakeen> that'd be `if L:` or `if bool(L):`.

[19:34:25] <foo> aidanhasaknife: The only truthy/falsey dynamics with a list are when a list is [] - that's falsey. Otherwise it's 0 or 1 with truthy false I think. Someone else might be able to chime in with more specifics though
[19:35:17] <supakeen> It's 'length' pretty much.

[19:35:31] <bjs> rounda: a tree is something that starts in one place and then branches, and then each of those branches can branch... and so on.  Each time you "divide" the array it's like branching the branch
[19:35:56] <bjs> rounda: you start with one call, and then it "branches" into two calls. Each of those calls "branch" into two more calls, and so on..
[19:36:14] <aidanhasaknife> supakeen Ah jeez, thanks for catching that! I'm having success now. foo Yeah, seems useful! I just had a syntax error :p

[19:37:39] <bjs> rounda: in some other languages they literally call if-statements "branching" :)
[19:37:39] <foo> Update: Hmm, I wonder if this is not a best practice and I'm overusing list generators. [p for p in projects if p.api_id==int(ids[1])] -> I can actually read all projects into a dict with key as project id, then a simple myprojects.get(project_id) - that will be faster than iterating through the list every time and I imagine faster than asking sqlalchemy to do this
[19:37:56] <rounda> @bjs i understand that concept, and that's how I started writing it, but the code provided doesnt actually do that... it just operates on two halves of an array. it doesn't break it down any further. for example, if I had an array of 100 items, it would still only be operating on "two" arrays of 50, instead of individual elements of "1" as the
[19:37:57] <rounda> visual representations show

[19:38:30] <bjs> rounda: if I want to merge_sort a list of 100 items, how many times does merge_sort get called?
[19:39:28] <rounda> @bjs thats another question.... the determining factor in the code is "if min < max"... min is ALWAYS less than max. So why isn't it an endless loop?

[19:40:33] <bjs> rounda: think about `merge_sort(array, mid + 1, max)`  <- here calls merge_sort again, but this new call has a *different* min and max
[19:40:42] <bjs> where min=(old mid+1) and max=old max

[20:56:00] <jinsun> last day can be 28, 30, 31, then you have to keep a mapping of month to last date, 1st day will always be 1
[20:56:16] <grym> or 29, once in a while
[20:56:19] <axisys> jinsun: to count all NewRelic metrics generated so far for last 3 months.. if I choose first day it is simpler I understand.. but then not counting last two weeks data until today
[20:56:39] <grym> (or, in 1740, some other weird set -- god help you if you're a historian)
[20:56:46] <axisys> ah.. so pyhton has no knowledge of last day of a month?
[20:57:03] <axisys> or python module like datetime for example
[20:57:25] <axisys> grym: lol.. no I am not
[20:57:26] <grym> axisys: if you said "90 days" instead of "3 months", i bet you'd hate yourself less
[20:57:47] <grym> i more or less know how long 90 days is
[20:58:07] <jinsun> there is relativedelta in dateutil that can do what you want and be right most of the time, stdlib datetime has to be told manually
[20:58:07] <axisys> grym: may be that is simpler.. ok.. I will convince my boss..
[20:58:25] <axisys> grym: ok so today and 90 days ago .. lets go with that
[20:58:51] <matsaman> days is easy, you can subtract datetime.timedelta(days=90)
[20:59:30] <grym> (we can still dicker about what clock time a day starts in, what time zone(s) we're in, and leap seconds, but those are easier to sweep under the table if all you really want is a window of time to sweep metrics up into)

[23:05:07] <Adoi> energizer, do these other ones get shown in traceback, too?
[23:05:21] <bjs> Adoi: the way these things work is that when you raise, it sort of "floats" up the set of function calls until it reaches a `try` with an `except` that matches it. Once it gets there, it stops and continues from that except.  If it floats all the way up and nowhere catches it then you get a traceback

[23:07:11] <Adoi> seriously, I cant follow
[23:07:26] <bjs> Adoi: tracebacks are caused by Python exceptions.
[23:08:13] <energizer> Adoi: you'll usually get some kind of message, but it won't necessarily be a traceback. you can get a segfault for example like this python -c 'import sys; sys.setrecursionlimit(9999999); f = lambda: f(); f()'

[23:09:11] <Adoi> then, if a program crashes, and all I have is the traceback, where do I go for to detect the cause?
[23:09:20] <bjs> Adoi: so the first thing to do when you get a "crash" is to figure out what the cause was and where it came from (was it an exception?  did the program quit on its own prematurely?  was it another piece of software that crashed?  did the OS kill it?)
[23:09:44] <bjs> Adoi: well that's what the traceback is for,  it tells you exactly what happened.  What function called which other function and what line caused the failure

[23:14:16] <Adoi> yes
[23:14:25] <bjs> From there, I mean, it depends what exception you got and why
[23:14:40] <bjs> Adoi: if `print("the value is", x/y)` gives you a ZeroDivsionError then you know you should look at what `y` is
[23:14:54] <cluelessperson> I'm completely stuck with qt, these attributes described in the documentation do not exist as far as I can tell.
[23:15:16] <bjs> Adoi: if it gives you a "TypeError: cannot divide str by int" or whatever then you know to look at what `x` is :)
[23:16:09] <Adoi> ah, right, so try/except might already be there, but it may be related to variables, functions..contained, for ex
[23:16:17] <Adoi> the error, I mean
[23:17:04] <bjs> Adoi: well I just mean more fundamentally exceptions are caused for specific reasons,  and the whole Python output is the traceback (that tells you the file and the line) and the error (the last line, it tells you *why* it was an exception).

[23:18:19] <bjs> ZeroDivisionError means clearly something was 0 when it shouldn't be and I should see how. TypeError means something is the wrong type and I need to convert somewhere.  NameError means one of the variables doesn't exist and I should check for typos or logic problems

[23:40:55] <mike18> hi - python shows some warnings - but doesnt tell me which line in my code... how to display the line?
[23:41:23] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@185.217.117.156)
[23:41:36] <kosh> that is weird, it should display a full traceback and the lines involved
[23:41:40] <mike18> https://ideone.com/dQg741
[23:41:45] <mike18> thats the warning
[23:41:51] <mike18> its not an error
[23:42:27] <mike18> i dont know how critical that issue is
[23:42:31] <grym> mike18: should be easy enough to grep for ` self._setitem_single_column(ilocs[0], value, pi)`  though
[23:44:02] <mike18> _setitem_single_column is the example

[23:44:30] <timdiels> Thanks for confirming, I too find generators nicer to see :)
[23:45:35] <bjs> mike18: you can run -Werror to turn the warnings into errors that have tracebacks.  Usually warnings are something you can silence or ignore anyway
[23:45:38] <molt> Quick Question: is "csv" a built-in Python Library? I believe it is... just double-checking with some real people in here while I make a few web searches :P

[23:51:57] <bjs> mike18: well no that's probably not right,  what's causing the warning? Is it your code?
[23:52:19] <mike18> no idk
[23:52:22] <mike18> i have the in my code
[23:52:27] <BrenBarn> grym: true, some really old stuff isn't noted
[23:52:55] <BrenBarn> I seem to recall some site somewhere that broke down a lot of history on when stuff was added but not sure where it was
[23:52:58] <mike18> bjs: does that mean the DeprecationWarning is ignored?
[23:53:02] <mike18> or printed?

[23:54:04] <bjs> if it was you,  you should figure out what it's trying to tell you and to fix it rather than trying to silence it :)
