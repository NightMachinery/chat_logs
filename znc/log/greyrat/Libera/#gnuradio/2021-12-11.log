[14:36:00] <notadog> So I'm using a tagged stream align + stream to vector, but it might be a bit of a naive approach
[14:44:03] <funkylab[m]> <linge93[m]> "It is not the parameter of my..." <- The solution here is that you need to add a layer that adds framing, anyway. Otherwise, how should the receiver know that the last bytes are padding?
[14:46:05] <funkylab[m]> So, linge93, the solution is not to add an inline block that tries to figure out if you're done too early. That's simply not how GNU Radio was designed. Instead, you need to take your data from your file, and put it in packets of fixed length with a header that says how much is in each packet, and send these packets. 
[14:46:33] <funkylab[m]> by far the easiest method would probably be writing a python block that reads from a file and does exactly that, and replace your file source with it.

[15:26:06] <funkylab[m]> if you want to modify it, you'd have to rebuild it, which usually boils down to a source build of GNU Radio; not too terrible a thing, but not what I'd recommend as "first steps in GNU Radio", if that's what it'd be for you :)

[15:32:07] <funkylab[m]> but for that you don't need to modify anything?
[15:32:33] <funkylab[m]> you just add a "multiply constant" block with an `e**(1j*phase)`  constant
[15:35:35] <drmpeg> Or you can use the chunks to symbols block is you need a really custom constellation.

[15:37:46] <funkylab[m]> which takes in bytes and uses them to look up complex values to produce
[15:38:17] <funkylab[m]> mcan06[m]: Can you elaborate on "part of the data"? 
[15:41:58] <mcan06[m]> I need to use constellation optimization and also change carrier with different phase and amplitude
[15:42:17] <mcan06[m]> funkylab[m]: I need to use constellation optimization and also change carrier with different phase and amplitude.
[15:42:53] <funkylab[m]> Ok, now we're getting into more complex things.
[15:43:28] <funkylab[m]> constellation optimization: does that mean you're replacing the standard constellation with some other, fixed constellation
[15:44:08] <funkylab[m]> (the carrier modifications literally have nothing to do with this, that's an effect that you just multiply with the baseband signal afterwards, so we can ignore this for now)
[15:51:43] <mcan06[m]> <funkylab[m]> "(the carrier modifications..." <- I didn't want to say carrier part, actually I just say that it is only baseband.
[15:53:56] <funkylab[m]> that's actually what I was referring to; these are all effects that happen after modulation, so you shouldn't try to include it into the modulation. The whole idea of GNU Radio is that you chain operations as blocks, don't break that where not necessary.
[15:54:12] <funkylab[m]> so, really, let's ignore your channel effects for now, OK?
[15:58:36] <mcan06[m]> OK, for instance if I am using 4+12 APSK scheme, how can I change this structure into 8+8 APSK?
[16:10:57] <funkylab[m]> well, that would have nothing to do with the constellations that are already in `dvbs2_modulator`, right
[16:11:16] <funkylab[m]> so you would simply start by using "Chunks to symbols" with your own constellation points instead
[16:14:34] <funkylab[m]> if it works well, then I would, in your place, discuss with drmpeg whether, and in which block, it would make sense to include this new constellation in `dvbs2_modulator`, but for now, this doesn't really sound like a slight modification, but a complete replacement
[16:16:05] <mcan06[m]> funkylab[m]: OK, thank you for your valuable responses.
[16:17:03] <funkylab[m]> I think what I wish to impart here is: make your life easy. Sometimes the right thing is to modify existing code, sometimes it's sensible to replace it, and some things are neither, but should be an additional step
[16:19:11] <funkylab[m]> as someone who's very intereseted in people contributing functionality into what comes out of the box with GNU Radio, I myself might often find myself heavily on "it's good to modify and extend what blocks can do right now", but in your case, I think it's simply a very involved thing to do, compared to simply putting the constellation points you wish to use in a vector

[18:32:26] <johncc3> Hi all. Can anyone suggest which encoding is used here:https://jcoppens.com/misc/tests/output.pdf ?
[18:32:44] *** Joins: yesno (~yesno@109.98.151.179)
[18:33:35] <johncc3> It's modulated as audio on VHF narrowband FM. The higher frequency is about 1750Hz. The lower freq cycles about half that freq.
[18:34:27] <funkylab[m]> johncc3:  what you describe there is an FSK. So, what's the question?
[18:34:48] <johncc3> I've considered most of the popular ones (NRZ, NRZI, Manchester, Manchester diff, etc...
[18:35:56] <johncc3> funkylab[m], the frequencies do not seem to coincide with standard AFSK or PSK. How to convert this to 1s and 0s?
[18:36:26] <funkylab[m]> there's no such thing like a "standardard AFSK".
[18:36:40] <funkylab[m]> by mapping the high frequency to one bit, and the low frequency to another
[18:38:30] <johncc3> That gives some problems: The length of the bits would be of different lengths
[18:39:14] <funkylab[m]> there's really an infinite amount of possible modulations
[18:39:52] <funkylab[m]> so, the fact that this is an oscillation transported over FM already means it's inherently a design made by the need to use some existing modulator, not to be good or even optimal in any other way
[18:40:38] <funkylab[m]> so, all "communications engineering expertise" is not going to be of much help; I'm afraid you'll either need to guess, or need to talk to someone who's got experience with these kinds of systems (which I'm sadly not)
[18:42:05] <johncc3> I suspect this is some interrogation system for water meters, or something similar. Was just trying to do some detective work ;)
[18:42:13] <funkylab[m]> now, that being out of the way: if something looks like an FSK, it might also be a pulse-shaped PSK, and the most popular (for good reason) is GMSK, so that would what I'd look into. If your differents lengths of periods happen to be half oscillations, especially
[18:42:42] <funkylab[m]> johncc3:  exactly, this is where looking at possible applications might be taking you further than "intelligently" looking at the signal. 
[18:43:26] <funkylab[m]> to be honest, 90% of AFSK / APSK / embed-anything-in-FM systems I saw were either to put data in FM broadcasts, or legacy ham radio stuff
[18:44:34] <johncc3> This transmission is not embedded in any broadcast. It's audio modulated as narrow-band FM.
[18:44:44] <funkylab[m]> If you build something like a power/water/gas meter, you have zero reason to use an FM modulator, as you're building a transceiver system anyway, and building an FSK transceiver directly is both easier and more spectrally efficient
[18:45:31] <funkylab[m]> (Hash's conference video might be of interest if you're into real-world power meter hunting)
[18:46:19] <johncc3> Exactly - there are several other similar systems I can receive which are directly PSK modulated. This one stands a bit out among them.
[18:46:54] <funkylab[m]> so, is this in a ham band?
[18:48:05] <johncc3> No it isn't.
[18:48:19] <funkylab[m]> hm
[18:48:30] <funkylab[m]> for what is that band licensed where you are?
[18:50:13] <funkylab[m]> (and: are you positive this is FM-containing-something, and not some e.g. 4-FSK natively, or some cosine-halfwave-shaped PSK or something?)
[18:50:48] <johncc3> Good idea. I'll try to find local frequency mappings...
[18:52:25] <johncc3> Of course it could be something I haven't considered. But to have these tones, I can't really imagine which signal would produce this signal in an FM decoder.
[18:55:12] <funkylab[m]> An estimate of the PSD before and after FM might be interesting to look at! Especially when trying to figure out symbol rates.
[18:59:13] <johncc3> I usually play with gqrx because of the easy tuning. Is there some widget in gnuradio which permits tuning easily? I tried fine/coarse sliders but nothing feels practical.

[19:10:55] <BarryDuggan[m]> johncc3: some legacy water utility systems used pulse width modulation to measure pressure, etc.
[19:14:28] <johncc3> BarryDuggan[m], Thanks. It doesn't seem PWM to me. The signal seems either a strange FSK or audio PSK.
[19:16:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> johncc3: The Qt Frequency sink supports click-to-tune via messages--that might help.    But really, the GUI bits of Gnu Radio have never primarily been about building gorgeous UIs--they've primarily been there as a diagnostic tool.  BUT, they have JUST enough functionality that you can build a large class of GUI driven apps, but don't expect them to be gorgeous....
[19:17:40] *** Joins: voltron (~voltrin_@ip4d16bdc6.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[19:19:11] <johncc3> patchvonbraun[m], No need for gorgeous ;)  And even the GQRX system isn't really _that_ practical, but it _is_ easier to use than 'ranges'.
[19:20:30] <johncc3> I've been over the DIY tutorials for the blocks, but if I'm not confused, the GUI things are not described there.
[19:21:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/QT_GUI_Frequency_Sink
[19:22:21] <BarryDuggan[m]> johncc3: Can you expand on what you mean by that, and what you are looking for?
[19:22:35] <johncc3> funkylab[m], I've finally found the nat'l frequency assignment table. It states (very helpfully) that the frequency is assigned to 'Fixed, Mobile, and satellite'.
[19:23:22] <BarryDuggan[m]> that's a pretty broad category!
[19:23:47] <johncc3> patchvonbraun[m], Yes... but it's the tuning I'm having problems with, not FFT or viewing.
[19:24:20] <johncc3> BarryDuggan[m], Isn't it? So that wasn't helpful.
[19:25:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> johncc3: RIght, but the FFT sink provides a clck-to-tune message-based interface as I recall, which can be helpful if you see a signal in the FFT and want to center on it.
[19:25:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> Otherwise, you have options like the range widgets or a simple entry widget.
