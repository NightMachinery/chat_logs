[00:00:00] <rawtaz> yeah? give me your worst of the day?
[00:00:15] <slaughter> Been debugging and translating an undocumented CI testing pipeline for a mobile app
[00:00:28] <slaughter> Boy howdy mobile testing is a clusterfk
[00:00:35] <rawtaz> oh that sounds horrible but more fun, but mine sounds easier to do so pehraps better anyway
[00:01:01] <slaughter> Depends on how you feel about dependency of dependency of dependency management
[00:01:18] <rawtaz> oh i never dabble with that, i hand that off to the dependency department :-)
[00:01:20] <slaughter> I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, just commenting/uncommenting and re-running over and over basically
[00:01:42] <rawtaz> or, depending on their mood for the day, they call themselves the department of dependencies.
[00:01:51] <rawtaz> and when i asked about that they just said it depends :(
[00:01:52] <slaughter> The testing framework's docs mostly just link to random lines of codes in their dependencies
[00:02:07] <slaughter> lmfao that's pretty good that got me a little
[00:02:12] <rawtaz> ah, i know what youre doing, it's the well established isolate by trial and error :)
[00:03:24] <slaughter> Pretty much
[00:03:39] <rawtaz> hm thats interesting. given how much tooling there is out there i'd expect there to be at least one well established and properly designed testing framework for that stuff
[00:03:53] <slaughter> This is the most popular one (for multi-platform apps, anyway)
[00:03:54] <rawtaz> considering we have tenzillions of every other type of thing you can think of
[00:03:59] <rawtaz> ok
[00:04:21] <slaughter> I don't even know how I would go about starting from scratch (because trust me, I already tried that). There's like no documentation out there at all
[00:04:42] <rawtaz> this is your chance though, to make something that will sell like heck
[00:04:53] <rawtaz> create something*
[00:05:10] <slaughter> Pain = money? 🤔
[00:05:33] <rawtaz> look at it this way - all you have to do to create that something is to NOT do any of the things you just spent your day doing
[00:05:43] <rawtaz> yeah its a tough balance there
[00:07:40] <slaughter> Eh it's all good, by the end ofthe week I'll be the SME on mobile app testing or something
[00:07:50] <rawtaz> yeah
[00:08:07] <rawtaz> paycheck here i cooome!, youll dance off into the moonlight :>
[00:12:57] <Dus10> I am of the opinion that mobile development requires DevOps
[00:13:22] <Dus10> I am not trying to play around with setting up mobile devices and transferring code or even using an emulator
[00:14:01] <Dus10> just use the pipeline and push and then use the testing delivery they have like TestFlight on iOS
[00:16:02] <fling> Dus10: are you good in java?
[00:16:03] <Dus10> of course, it is like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/qly49e/when_they_say_to_not_step_in_puddles_this_is_the/
[00:16:15] <Dus10> fling: good?  no way
[00:16:24] <fling> I'm looking for java devs also for mobile development.
[00:16:30] <Dus10> I used to be a Java dev... but that was over 20 years ago that I hung that up
[00:16:31] <fling> and for python coders
[00:16:49] <Dus10> oh, I definitely don't mobile development
[00:16:57] <Dus10> I just look at the cluster it must be and realize... it has to be a pipeline
[00:17:28] <slaughter> You just gotta get that pipeline going first
[00:25:06] <rawtaz> its crazy how much java devs are sought for
[00:25:46] <fling> sorry!
[00:26:10] <rawtaz> for what? i didnt mean you in here :D
[00:26:19] <rawtaz> just like that there's a lot of work for java devs out there :)
[00:27:11] <fling> I hate java!
[00:27:38] <kwilczynski> In Soviet Russia, Java hates YOU!
[00:27:38] <kwilczynski> :P
[00:27:49] <rawtaz> lol
[00:27:54] <rawtaz> why do you hate java? :)
[00:28:13] <rawtaz> i think its pretty nice actually, i never understood why people complain so much about it :o
[00:29:31] <rawtaz> at least for the programmer
[00:30:07] <slaughter> It's big, it's heavy, it's slow, the build system is a nightmare, the syntax is horrendous
[00:30:59] <rawtaz> hm i really dont think thats fair. the syntax is explicit, but thats a design decision. theres lots to hate about Go syntax as wel, and any other language you can find. neither of them is perfect :)
[00:31:10] <rawtaz> slow, sure. but the ecosystem is pretty awesome
[00:31:22] <rawtaz> whats wrong with the build system? i dont have much experience with that
[00:34:03] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Big, yes. Heavy, yes. But slow... that depends.
[00:34:15] <kwilczynski> slaughter: The bytecode runs quite fast.
[00:34:43] <rawtaz> once a hater always a hater ;-)
[00:34:49] <kwilczynski> Sadly, most people learn atrocities such as Hibernate and such.
[00:34:53] <kwilczynski> And then we hate Java :/
[00:35:07] <slaughter> Admittedly I only did Java/Android in code school and then noped out so very limited exposure
[00:35:14] <Dus10> kwilczynski: Java hates you anywhere
[00:35:14] <kwilczynski> Kotlin is quite nice, actually, as far as JVM based languages go.
[00:35:21] <kwilczynski> Scala is nice but a bit a handful.
[00:35:53] <Dus10> what is funny... I really stopped using Java after I picked up PHP
[00:36:16] <Dus10> I haven't really touched that in about 15 years, though
[00:36:18] <kwilczynski> Now.
[00:36:22] <rawtaz> might that have been due to php being so much easier to work with, quicker feedback loop and debugging etc?
[00:36:31] <kwilczynski> I am not sure if Dus10 is being genuine or trolling us.
[00:36:32] <kwilczynski> PHP...
[00:36:36] <kwilczynski> Saint Mother of ...
[00:36:43] <kwilczynski> :P
[00:36:47] <kwilczynski> I am just joking!
[00:36:48] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: php has pros and cons like everything else
[00:36:51] <rawtaz> lol
[00:36:55] <kwilczynski> I know :)
[00:37:01] <Dus10> yes, the feedback loop is better in PHP
[00:37:08] <kwilczynski> I used to do CGI in Perl...
[00:37:14] <kwilczynski> So PHP was a blessing.
[00:37:16] <Dus10> haha :)
[00:37:16] <rawtaz> whenever i dabble with compiled junk i miss the simplicity in being able to just add a line of code to debug something right there in the app where it's happening.
[00:37:39] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:37:56] <Dus10> people were really throwing a fit when Microsoft essentially added that ability to .NET and then removed for any platform other than Windows
[00:38:13] <Dus10> they relented, so it is on all platforms for the .NET 6 release sometime this month
[00:38:37] <kwilczynski> I never used C# or .NET, but it seems OK.
[00:38:39] <rawtaz> what ability?
[00:38:58] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: They, after 30 years, learned how to do Internet things in .NET :P
[00:39:01] * kwilczynski runs...
[00:39:05] <Dus10> change a line of code and not need to recompile
[00:39:12] <Dus10> even though it is compiled language
[00:39:28] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:39:39] <kwilczynski> https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tale-of-a-single-register-value/
[00:39:49] <Dus10> what they effectively tried was to limit it to Visual Studio, only
[00:39:57] <Dus10> so, limiting it to Windows
[00:40:09] <Dus10> but now it can be done anywhere, including VS Code
[00:40:28] <kwilczynski> I wonder what happened to Django?
[00:40:30] <Dus10> I have really wanted to dive into C#... but I am starting to get pulled towards Go
[00:40:37] <kwilczynski> RoR is still raring.
[00:40:51] <kwilczynski> But somehow I don't hear anything about Django nowadays.
[00:41:11] <kwilczynski> Or... webpy, or Sinatra... or... I am old ;/
[00:41:14] <rawtaz> Dus10: uh how would oyu do that, if it's a compiled thing?
[00:41:25] <rawtaz> like how do you add a line of code somewhere in the app code without recompiling the thing?
[00:41:32] <Dus10> well, it isn't really compile
[00:41:35] <rawtaz> Go is great. that and Elixir for web stuff
[00:41:35] <Dus10> compiled
[00:41:44] <Dus10> it is like Java... there is the Byte code
[00:41:50] <Dus10> not the instructions
[00:41:54] <rawtaz> sure, it's built into bytecode
[00:42:01] <kwilczynski> Go.
[00:42:05] <kwilczynski> PHP
[00:42:08] <kwilczynski> .NET...
[00:42:22] <kwilczynski> BUT! WE NEED TO REWRITE EVERYTHING TO RUST!
[00:42:23] <kwilczynski> ;D
[00:42:24] <Dus10> so they just monitor the changes and Roslyn, the compiler, is setup to work in memory
[00:42:27] <rawtaz> fuck rust :P
[00:42:37] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: But only using unsafe!
[00:42:38] <kwilczynski> :P
[00:42:39] <Dus10> Rust seems pretty nice
[00:42:53] <Dus10> for Kernel dev, at least
[00:42:54] <rawtaz> whats nice about it besides its correctness and speed?
[00:42:56] <rawtaz> hmm
[00:43:04] <kwilczynski> Compiler error messages
[00:43:04] <kwilczynski> ;]
[00:43:15] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: hard to beat Elixir in that
[00:43:29] <rawtaz> most friendly and helpful messages you can find basically
[00:43:36] <kwilczynski> :/
[00:44:07] <rawtaz> :*
[00:44:31] <Dus10> eh, let's just go back to assembly
[00:44:43] <kwilczynski> ... and then he will mention Erlang... and OTP and...
[00:44:48] * kwilczynski cries.
[00:44:48] <Dus10> or punchcards
[00:45:09] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Switches.
[00:45:25] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Cards are too cutting edge.
[00:45:31] <Dus10> relays!
[00:45:41] <kwilczynski> OK.
[00:45:46] <kwilczynski> You forced my hand.
[00:45:51] <kwilczynski> GO ABACUS!!!
[00:45:56] <kwilczynski> :>
[00:46:02] <Dus10> okay, okay
[00:46:21] <Dus10> maybe we just make a pneumatic abacus computer
[00:46:29] <kwilczynski> I have a punch card with small snippet that prints my name. In a frame in the office.
[00:46:31] <Dus10> or hydraulic
[00:46:33] <kwilczynski> My wife always mocks me for it.
[00:46:55] <Dus10> you should make a backup
[00:47:28] <kwilczynski> Dus10: We might be too late... Babage was onto something.
[00:47:59] <kwilczynski> But, if we are reiventing things, then let's do it proper steampunk.
[00:49:18] <kwilczynski> Dus10: How is the lookout for an employee going?
[00:49:56] <Dus10> we have two candidates
[00:50:13] <Dus10> we will see... we will evaluate them as contractors
[00:50:34] <Dus10> I hate to instill poor habits in the other employees, so I am nervous about it
[00:55:27] <slaughter> Passphrase on ssh keys or no?
[00:56:48] <kwilczynski> slaughter: It's a good idea to set it.
[00:56:53] * rawtaz is for passphrases unless you really need one for a specific automation case
[00:57:11] <rawtaz> i enver sleep well knowing that someone who can access my computer can use my keys if they dont have passwords
[00:57:22] <kwilczynski> But if you are suffering on CI/CD, then maybe not (consider rotating often with SSH CA)
[00:57:37] <kwilczynski> Dus10: :)
[00:58:30] <rawtaz> Dus10: what are your requirements when selecting your candidates? what must they know/have done?

[01:02:36] <rawtaz> you're good company, that's a skill
[01:02:38] <kwilczynski> I am sure this counts.
[01:02:48] <rawtaz> also we can make fun of you when you are not around, that's huge
[01:02:59] <rawtaz> as are you, im sure
[01:03:01] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I know you do.
[01:03:05] <rawtaz> :* 
[01:03:32] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I have a bot to record channel conversation so I can then update my top list of people I want to send to Australia. :)
[01:03:55] <rawtaz> hahaha
[01:04:26] <rawtaz> i think there's an opportunity for you and fling to collaborate there ;)
[01:04:37] <rawtaz> unless im mistaken he was in .au and wanted his new collegues to be there too
[01:04:38] <kwilczynski> How come?
[01:04:46] <kwilczynski> Ahh. I see.
[01:04:48] <rawtaz> (not being interested in remote workers)
[01:04:52] <kwilczynski> I can provide him with skilled engineers.
[01:04:53] <fling> I don't see
[01:05:12] <fling> ok, dispatch the engineers
[01:05:38] * rawtaz opens the cage
[01:05:41] <kwilczynski> fling: I read today that some town is handing out land to people willing to move in.
[01:05:42] <kwilczynski> Rad.
[01:06:10] <rawtaz> thats like when swedish people settled in america :)

[01:06:47] <kwilczynski> Oh my!
[01:06:56] <kwilczynski> fling is speaking Cthulhu!
[01:07:15] <fling> this is what you get if you type with your keyboard flipped
[01:07:20] <fling> like they do in australia
[01:07:42] <kwilczynski> ;/
[01:07:59] <fling> can't you read it?
[01:08:01] <kwilczynski> And I used to believe that having ice cream in the middle of December was odd enough!
[01:09:09] <fling> rawtaz: are the ingeneers on the loose now? Will I have to catch them myself?
[01:09:19] <fling> kwilczynski: or will you provide me with any details?
[01:09:39] <kwilczynski> Hold your horses!
[01:09:55] * fling holds two horses with one hand

[01:11:15] <kwilczynski> fling: Mind you, for the record, I have nothing against Aussies. :)
[01:11:37] <kwilczynski> Meet quite a few back in Japan, and always had a blast.
[01:11:44] <fling> neither I, this is for my friend
[01:12:09] <kwilczynski> fling: I read that IT market there is a real bummer.
[01:12:20] <kwilczynski> Not enough folks.
[01:12:27] <fling> kwilczynski: I'm german, not aussie, I'm in russia now, in hong kong timezone, the same they use in japan probably
[01:12:47] <rawtaz> fling: oh they're not with you? i guess they got lost :(
[01:12:58] <kwilczynski> A German Gentleman living in Russia on APAC time zone.
[01:13:03] * fling releases the horses
[01:13:07] <kwilczynski> There must be some story to be told here.
[01:13:34] <fling> it is not family friendly
[01:13:47] <kwilczynski> :(
[01:13:53] <kwilczynski> I was already all ears.
[01:14:07] <kwilczynski> We need ##devops-afterhours
[01:14:07] <kwilczynski> :P
[01:14:12] <fling> haha
[01:14:20] <fling> I'm looking for remote jobs myself btw
[01:14:37] <fling> my remote work dried out of tasks
[01:14:45] <kwilczynski> Really?
[01:14:47] <fling> yes
[01:15:10] <kwilczynski> fling: Any possibility to start some greenfield project?
[01:15:28] <kwilczynski> fling: What role are you after?
[01:16:33] <fling> sent you my resume
[01:16:47] <kwilczynski> It said "this file will mine Bitcoin"
[01:16:54] <fling> devops engineer or maybe sre specialist
[01:17:04] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:17:06] <fling> kwilczynski: sounds right, execute it
[01:17:16] <kwilczynski> fling: I did! I hacked me TV.
[01:17:35] <fling> enter your card details
[01:17:37] <kwilczynski> fling: I don't have experience working remotely from Russia... but must be no different to Poland, I suppose.
[01:18:14] <kwilczynski> fling: Done. I told me I won 2000 BTC from my long lost aunt from South Africa.
[01:18:25] <fling> I have no idea, architecture is similar, grumpy slavs everywhere etc

[01:19:23] <fling> just looking for good remote jobs
[01:19:34] <fling> paying ones, where management don't disappear :D
[01:19:40] <fling> need some $$$ for plane tickets
[01:20:03] <rawtaz> uh wait, i thought you fling were looking for engineers?
[01:20:15] <rawtaz> for the company where you work
[01:20:36] <fling> rawtaz: for the company where my friend works
[01:21:29] <rawtaz> oh ok
[01:22:21] <fling> there are other open positions too
[01:37:48] <Dus10> rawtaz: right now, we're looking for a senior person for Infrastructure as Code work with the full GitOps treatment
[01:38:21] <Dus10> Ideally, Azure DevOps and/or GitHub Actions experience doing full pipelines with actually testing methodologies applied
[01:38:46] <Dus10> tooling... Ansible, Packer, Terraform, OPA, at a minimum
[01:39:09] <Dus10> really just needing someone that can prove that they have done these things in the past and be able to mentor junior folks
[01:39:17] <rawtaz> yeah. i see what you mean
[01:39:21] <rawtaz> need some serious experience there
[01:39:23] <Dus10> we mostly hire entry-level folks
[01:39:31] <Dus10> at least that is what I am responsible for
[01:39:53] <Dus10> I just don't have as much time as I would like to take on my project load right now and do all of the mentoring
[01:40:17] <rawtaz> ideally they should learn themselves, you should only need to point them to what they need to solve..
[01:40:29] <rawtaz> i guess thats where they fall short
[01:40:35] <Dus10> well, we have a curriculum for them and they self-study
[01:40:41] <rawtaz> even more so then :)
[01:40:53] <Dus10> but it is the customer interaction and real world stuff that they need a guiding hand with
[01:41:03] <rawtaz> aha
[01:41:15] <Dus10> some of the folks are fine with all of it, honestly
[01:41:25] <Dus10> but those people keep moving on quickly :)
[01:42:10] <Dus10> my plan has been to take the best folks that I trained and get them to take on some of the training burden, but before we can move them into that role with the appropriate compensation, they're already gone
[01:42:58] <rawtaz> haha
[01:43:00] <rawtaz> sic
[01:43:01] <rawtaz> k
[01:44:00] <Dus10> fortunately, we have made back our investment on them
[01:44:17] <Dus10> we give them about 18 months to get through our "program"
[01:44:27] <Dus10> they get a promotion at the end of it
[01:44:44] <Dus10> the best folks have left about 6 months after that
[02:00:32] <rawtaz> i really cant relate to that mentality.. if i were to start somewhere i wouldnt do so with any other thought htat i'd be there for a while. i guess it's some mental misfire in the heads of those that are young and dont know anything real and whenthey start knowing something they thing they're all valuable and stuff and want to move to higher paying stuff
[02:00:44] <rawtaz> which to be frank is douchebaggery
[02:04:19] <slaughter> Hard to argue with lateral movement when it results in huge pay bumps
[02:05:57] <slaughter> I get recruiter spam for 25%+ pay bumps like every day. I'm with you on wanting to stay in one place, but I wouldn't necessarily fault someone for taking the raise
[02:07:21] <rawtaz> i think it depends
[02:07:40] *** Joins: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium)
[02:08:01] <rawtaz> if you or someone having say 20 years experience takes a raise after having been with a company a while, then thats one thing. but these young ones, who dont actually have many useful skills, and who are paid to learn the craft(s), thats a different story.
[02:08:15] <rawtaz> i can think that they think too highly of themselves and are too ungrateful
[02:08:31] <rawtaz> but its different from when you have a bunch of experience and especially when you gained it all by yourself
[02:10:15] <rawtaz> hm
[02:10:45] <rawtaz> im watching a documentary.. and it strikes me that the word "assassings" consists of "ass", "ass" and "ins". im not sure how i feel about that :<
[02:11:08] <kwilczynski> ass-ass-sings? :)
[02:11:14] <kwilczynski> As in... farting? :P
[02:11:38] <kwilczynski> OK.
[02:11:44] <kwilczynski> I will see myself out :P
[02:12:11] <rawtaz> lol
[02:12:13] <rawtaz> blame me
[02:13:07] <kwilczynski> OK.
[02:13:11] <kwilczynski> <-- he made me do ti1
[02:13:13] <kwilczynski> :P
[02:13:22] <rawtaz> hehe
[02:13:46] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: When you get older... it's the opposite. You tend to stick around as companies are a bit biased against older folks.
[02:13:48] <rawtaz> actually we can blame everyone in the world who isnt in here to talk devops things instead, thats the only reason we fill this chan with.. this
[02:14:01] <kwilczynski> fling: I am almost 40, and it's harder to find a job.
[02:14:04] <kwilczynski> Ops.
[02:14:07] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: That is.
[02:14:07] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: thats a point too
[02:14:11] <rawtaz> aha
[02:15:02] <kwilczynski> So younger folks have some upward mobility that old geezers like me don't.
[02:15:14] <kwilczynski> They can move cities... countries... planets?
[02:15:43] <kwilczynski> And can accept lower base salaries - having comparably lower expenses (no family? no kids? living on pizza?)
[02:15:45] <slaughter> <rawtaz> i can think that they think too highly of themselves and are too ungrateful -> perhaps, but if FAANG is recruiting them....
[02:16:51] <rawtaz> yeah lets do it
[02:18:10] <kwilczynski> Hmm.
[02:18:26] <kwilczynski> I am not sure what to think of people leaving after just a little while.
[02:19:07] <kwilczynski> I suppose, if every business could offer the same compensation as the "FAANG" companies, and the same level of challenge...
[02:19:27] <kwilczynski> The, most likely, nobody will find the incentive to move (unless there will be other circumstances).
[02:20:01] <kwilczynski> But given how the World is today, I can't blame anyone, especially young people.
[02:20:21] <kwilczynski> Provided that they are good engineers, then why not?
[02:20:57] <kwilczynski> But, this is a two-way street, so we get a lot of people who are in it just for the fat paycheck (and nothing wrong with that, if this is their thing), but they tend to do a lot of collateral damage.
[02:21:07] <slaughter> Yeah that's the worst IMO
[02:21:29] <kwilczynski> https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ywtm.jpg
[02:21:46] <kwilczynski> s/so/as/
[02:21:52] <slaughter> Doing code school, that was a common theme. People who "heard programming makes good money" but didn't have any passion at all for it. Very few of them even completed the course, but I feel for the coworkers of the ones that did and landed jobs
[02:23:10] <rawtaz> there are so many people who go through programming schools but simply have no business there
[02:23:32] <rawtaz> who do have business there and who doesnt is possible to tell very quickly, but its not a criteria in most places unfortunately
[02:23:54] <kwilczynski> The lack of "spark", so to speak... lack of passion means lack of natural curiosity and this breeds mediocre outcomes...
[02:24:35] <rawtaz> yeah. if a person who had access to computers havent started fiddling with them in a technical way, then they shouldnt try to learn programming by going to a school. its not their thing. this may sound hard but i think theres something to it
[02:24:52] <kwilczynski> I do sure how that the doctors and surgeons I hand my life to have passion for the profession - to contrast this with something. :)
[02:24:57] <rawtaz> if you havent had the curiosity before, why on earth would you have the drive or spark later
[02:25:02] <rawtaz> there are exceptions of course, but very few
[02:25:29] <rawtaz> yeah heh
[02:25:42] <kwilczynski> It's a complicate topic.
[02:26:12] <kwilczynski> complicated*
[02:26:37] <kwilczynski> In terms of people who are passionate...
[02:26:48] <kwilczynski> Knuth said that learning is a skill.
[02:26:56] <kwilczynski> And I have to agree with him, somewhat.
[02:27:11] <kwilczynski> Since being an engineer means you are a life-long student.
[02:27:15] <rawtaz> yeah theres nuances to it all
[02:27:30] <kwilczynski> The only thing that is constant is.. change. :)
[02:27:36] <kwilczynski> Hehe.
[02:27:39] <slaughter> Yeah I have met a few people who weren't at all computer nerds in any way but were generally pretty interested in learning - they are sometimes the 10x/rockstar/ninja/whatever people
[02:27:55] <kwilczynski> Indeed.
[02:28:11] <slaughter> Maybe not having a deep deep burning hatred for all things electronic is a good thing...
[02:28:12] <kwilczynski> Passion, curiosity, interest... love of doing something.
[02:28:36] <kwilczynski> This will get you through the long nights of hacking on something or taking things apart to understand how it works. :)
[02:29:45] <slaughter> The burning hatred? :)
[02:30:03] <rawtaz> i guess ive just seen too many incompetent people, and thats not just in programming, but in most areas of IT
[02:30:25] <rawtaz> and ive seen so many programmers pop out of school and not understanding even the basics
[02:30:38] <rawtaz> (it's a complete mystery how they passed exams)
[02:30:39] <slaughter> It's a tough curriculum
[02:31:15] <rawtaz> :)
[02:31:38] <slaughter> Get a CS degree, you likely don't know even the basics of real world dev work. Do a code school, and they don't have the time to touch any CS or a wide berth of peripheral things like databases or tools etc
[02:32:14] <slaughter> Do self-taught and it's 50/50 you pick a horrid language/stack that doesn't translate to the real world
[02:33:12] <rawtaz> we should all just give up i think
[02:33:20] <rawtaz> its all pointless :<
[02:33:28] * rawtaz sniffs
[02:34:26] <slaughter> Probably, but I hate computers so much I'm going to keep doing it until I can say I've conquered them
[02:35:40] <rawtaz> ha :)
[02:42:48] <kwilczynski> I should probably feel bad about this. And somewhat I am, sometimes.
[02:42:55] <kwilczynski> But I don't have a degree.
[02:43:13] <kwilczynski> I first went to study physics, but had to leave to go to work full time.
[02:43:33] <kwilczynski> And then, years later, I went to study CS and maths, and had to leave after I was unable to pay for it. :)
[02:44:05] <kwilczynski> Every time I mention to someone, especially at work, that I don't have a proper formal degree to work in IT, I get looks and eye rolling.
[02:44:07] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:51:53] <rawtaz> i dont have one either
[02:52:01] <rawtaz> and for some reason that makes people thing i dont know anything lol
[02:52:26] <rawtaz> but did you study CS for a while before dropping out?
[03:00:04] <kwilczynski> Yes.
[03:01:24] <kwilczynski> I really enjoyed maths more than CS while working towards this particular degree.
[03:02:10] <kwilczynski> Nowadays, I think of going back and completing... but then I also think, that this sort of money are better spent on... putting things towards buying a property, and such.
[03:02:11] <kwilczynski> :)
[03:03:00] <rawtaz> yeah probably. i mean, if you are curious you can always study math in your free time
[03:09:22] <kwilczynski> Oh course :)
[03:09:37] <kwilczynski> Sadly, this won't give me a shiny piece of paper to hang on the wall :)
[03:10:03] <kwilczynski> (not that I care)
[03:17:50] <slaughter> I don't have a degree either. I think the majority of our eng org doesn't have degrees/has degrees in other stuff
