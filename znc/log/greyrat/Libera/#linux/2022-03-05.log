[00:45:38] <boris_> we have a VPS that we are using to host a simple web app. Currently the app is accessed through nginx.
[00:45:38] <boris_> I was thinking if by any chance I could use the VPS to configure openvpn server on it , configure it to use mullvad and then use this as a proxy for my devices.
[00:45:39] <LjL> to run those things it must sacrifice part of its openness and freedom in favor of DRM
[00:45:40] <boris_> My problem is that if I just set up openvpn all traffic of the VPS will be forwarded to Mullvad's VPN network

[03:05:40] <hentai> I want an operation to either happen, or not happen, with no state in between
[03:06:14] <Gustavo6046> That is impossible because of the file cache, which, as it turns out, is also vital for the operation of a modern computer.
[03:06:17] <hentai> And they dare take it from my mainline kernel!
[03:06:20] <Gustavo6046> Maybe it is a bad thing to have that.
[03:06:27] <Gustavo6046> Depends on the use case of course

[04:46:46] <duxsco> “When we use the phrase ‘End to End’ in our other literature, it is in reference to the connection being encrypted from Zoom end point to Zoom end point,” the Zoom spokesperson wrote, apparently referring to Zoom servers as “end points” even though they sit between Zoom clients. “The content is not decrypted as it transfers across the Zoom cloud” through the networking between these machines.

[18:07:42] <phogg> Elw3: toolkits wanting to support both X and wayland need to be structured for that from the beginning. You will have to have an abstraction layer in your codebase and a point where you detect which environment is running. Or you could instead switch off at compile time.

[19:38:10] <boba> isn't compiling the kernel already part of the process?
[19:38:16] <duxsco> i don't see the issue here. why not blacklist? use "module_blacklist" in kernel command line

[19:40:01] <hexnewbie> If firmware disablement is too small a ‘deterrent’? software blacklisting will not cut it. Albeit I'm not sure why not compiling it in as good in place of cutting the wires off of the motherboard

[20:53:45] <akk> font rendering (in X) is different on every distro -- fontconfig settings are enormously complex.

[21:54:18] <rbox> it loads the binary, it loads the libraries, then when the binary gets to the part where it wants to execute code from the library, it just starts running code from the location the library was loaded

[22:29:36] <kitzman> one thing which is 100% from the device itself, is that after a while it just... stops working. so i'm expecting that there exists an option to turn of the standby

[23:24:54] <hojasuelta> workin on AWS certs-- this is a great intro to the concept of block level storage for example-- I thought it was a general OS concept but its more of a cloud topic-- a cloud-computing methodolgy to emulate traditional OS storage-- i.e. S3

[23:25:51] <hodapp> it's broader than cloud and long predates it

[23:26:13] <bitskit> @hexnewbie it was. I had a macbook with ubuntu on it and switched my main to a newer thinkpad with better specs. after like, two years of use, the graphics card died so I dug the macbook out of the closet and was basically unable to install anything anymore
[23:26:16] <hojasuelta> i wasn't aware it existed until I read this cloud cert guide
[23:26:39] <hojasuelta> b/c I lack CS knowledge & context due to not studying it formally (or much informally either-- jumped into full stack dev w/o CS background)
