[02:15:39] <Han> asuming this command: echo -n 'nomatch\n1 one\n2 two\n3 three\nnomatch\n'|awk '/[0-9]/ {NR==1; print $2}'  
[02:16:50] <Han> Now what wanted to do was print the second word of the first matching line, i.e. "one". And I get one\ntwo\nthree
[02:16:58] <Han> How should I do that?
[02:17:22] <emanuele6> that echo command is supposed to print multiple lines, right?
[02:18:10] <Han> That's what it does, see for yourself.
[02:18:16] <e36freak> no it doesn't
[02:18:18] <emanuele6> # echo -n 'nomatch\n1 one\n2 two\n3 three\nnomatch\n'
[02:18:19] <shbot> emanuele6: nomatch\n1 one\n2 two\n3 three\nnomatch\n
[02:18:21] <e36freak> not without -e
[02:18:24] <emanuele6> you are probably using macos
[02:18:33] <emanuele6> so it expands \n by default
[02:18:36] <emanuele6> that is not common
[02:18:42] <e36freak> use printf, printf '%s\n' nomatch '1 one' '2 two' '3 three' nomatch
[02:18:49] <e36freak> that's portable, and easier to read anyway
[02:18:59] <Han> I use zsh, ok I meant -e
[02:19:36] <e36freak> Han: '/[0-9]/ {print $2; exit}'
[02:19:58] <e36freak> your NR==1 isn't used as a conditional for anything, and even if it were it would only be true for the first input line which is "nomatch"
[02:20:09] <e36freak> either just exit after the first match, or set a flag variable
[02:20:23] <e36freak> '/[0-9]/ && !flag }print $2; flag = 1}'
[02:20:28] <e36freak> '/[0-9]/ && !flag {print $2; flag = 1}'
[02:20:39] <e36freak> or again, '/[0-9]/ {print $2; exit}'
[02:20:39] <Han> Ah, that makes sense. And how do I get the Nth line?
[02:20:48] <e36freak> change the flag variable to a counter
[02:21:24] <Han> You type faster than I can read. +0
[02:23:16] <e36freak> '/[0-9]/ && ++c == 2 {print $2; exit}' would be one way
[02:23:27] <e36freak> to get the second, for example
[02:24:05] <e36freak> if you want every Nth match just reset c=0 instead of exit there
[02:24:14] <e36freak> lots of options
[02:24:54] <Han> Thanks!

[20:14:40] <lopid> apply the awk solution given yesterday in #sed
[20:14:45] <emanuele6> sysctl -a  does not output   dev.cpu.1.temperature: 33,0C   there is no way
[20:14:53] <emanuele6> that is not the output format of sysctl -a
[20:15:43] <emanuele6> and it is obvious that your `sysctl -a' on your system doesn't output that because you even sent this
[20:15:46] <emanuele6> <dandyn > I tried this : sysctl -a | awk '{print $3}'
[20:16:05] <emanuele6> sysctl -a    would output something like   dev.cpu.1.temperature = 33,0C
[20:16:14] <emanuele6> not dev.cpu.1.temperature: 33,0C
[20:19:42] <dandyn> hi emanuele6: what you mean blatant error ?

[20:24:41] <emanuele6> are you for real telling us that your `sysctl' outputs  `dev.cpu.1.temperature: 33,0C' instead of `dev.cpu.1.temperature = 33,0C'?
[20:25:13] <dandyn> sysctl -a | grep dev.cpu.1.temperature

[20:37:14] <dandyn> :P
[20:38:22] <dandyn> I can open the window close to the box to get it that cold :P
[20:40:10] <nmz> no, then the motherboard will too airy. you will mess with the internal humidity of the system.
[20:40:12] <nmz> woops
[20:40:16] <nmz> made it made sense
[21:47:51] <dandyn> solution: sysctl -a | grep dev.cpu.1.temperature | sed 's/^.*:/CPU Temp:/'
[21:47:53] <dandyn> :D
[21:48:15] <emanuele6> dandyn: this is #awk, not #sed
[21:48:52] <emanuele6> but you can use:    sysctl -a | sed -n 's/^dev\.cpu\.1\.temperature:/CPU Temp:/p'
[21:49:33] <emanuele6> but there is no point:    printf 'CPU temp: %s\n' "$(sysctl -n dev.cpu.1.temperature)"
[21:50:43] <dandyn> thanks I really appreciate it..
[21:50:56] <dandyn> yes, it's strange. can't explain that.
[21:51:30] <dandyn> A BUG OR SOMETHING.
[21:51:32] <dandyn> ops.
[21:52:32] <dandyn> I'll go with your example. but what does \p do ?
[21:52:42] <emanuele6> #sed
[21:52:49] <dandyn> ok
[21:52:56] <dandyn> thnx again.
