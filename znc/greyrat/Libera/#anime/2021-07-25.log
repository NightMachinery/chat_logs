[01:14:28] <cthulchu> I've been annoyed how anime is made for 14-16 year kids
[01:14:35] <cthulchu> it's annoying to watch when you're 30
[01:15:14] <cthulchu> there are a few pieces of anime that are good for adults. Like Mushishi, Lain's experiments. But those are like RARE.
[01:34:12] <FroLeMageBlanc> agreed, although i can still enjoy animes aimed at young teens when they're well made

[02:04:23] <theholyduck> we are working on a redirect from here to #anime 
[02:04:25] <theholyduck> er
[02:04:28] <theholyduck> from here to there
[02:04:40] <theholyduck> but. confact_  is being a derp

[02:13:49] <cthulchu> theholyduck, oh dude, THANK YOU
[02:14:07] <cthulchu> they should make a bloody redirection from here to there

[02:16:17] <theholyduck> we have petitioned the ircops to do that a few times but it just gets lost in more important buisness
[02:16:28] <theholyduck> for a while this channel was closed by the ircops. then a netsplit happened and confact ended up in charge here
[02:16:53] <theholyduck> confact is the brother of one of the mod team on ##anime. so we will presumably get the redirect. whenever confact gets away from his wife and children and back to a computer
