[05:07:08] <BWMerlin> T1 should escalate to someone before this role IMO but I haven't worked in a large org like that for many years now
[05:07:25] <sd> 15<山​姆> We're not yet at that stage
[05:07:41] <BWMerlin> How many people in IT do you currently have?
[05:07:44] <sd> 15<山​姆> Me
[05:07:44] <BWMerlin> Not including this role
[05:07:47] <sd> 15<山​姆> And devs
[05:07:55] <csws> you have an MSP?
[05:07:58] <sd> 15<山​姆> No
[05:08:02] <csws> wow
[05:08:10] <sd> 15<山​姆> Don't need one tbh
[05:08:14] <BWMerlin> So for your entire company you are the only IT support?
[05:08:25] <sd> 15<山​姆> Yes, I only launched IT support as of December 2021
[05:08:59] <BWMerlin> Has this company been around for a while?  How was IT support handled prior to Dec 21?
[05:09:16] <sd> 15<山​姆> There was no IT support prior to Dec 21 beyond people asking other people if they knew how to do X
[05:09:20] <sd> 15<山​姆> And company is 1 year old
[05:09:24] <sd> 15<山​姆> Or just slightly over
[05:09:41] <sd> 15<山​姆> 1.5yrs max I'd say
[05:10:30] <iphone> I'm curious what the company does
[05:10:40] <sd> 15<山​姆> ISP
[05:10:40] <BWMerlin> Will this new role report to you (are you to be the new head of IT)?
[05:10:53] <sd> 15<山​姆> I will be something like head/director of IT, but it's unconfirmed atm
[05:10:53] <BWMerlin> Wait wtf
[05:11:04] <sd> 15<山​姆> This will report into me until there is some form of operations management for IT
[05:11:12] <iphone> isp
[05:11:15] <iphone> with one tech person
[05:11:23] <sd> 15<山​姆> This is org IT, not network team
[05:11:31] <xe0n> oO
[05:11:34] <sd> 15<山​姆> The network team covers our actual service, not org IT
[05:11:46] <BWMerlin> Okay, these are things that help
[05:11:46] <sd> 15<山​姆> But I also cover their servers and take part in their on-call atm
[05:11:47] <iphone> so lots of employees a 1337 and don't need much support
[05:12:17] <sd> 15<山​姆> I probably get about ~10-15 tickets per week including onboarding tickets
[05:12:22] <BWMerlin> I still think this is very underpaid, I don't think this is a sysadmin role but something higher
[05:12:36] <sd> 15<山​姆> If I took automation out, do you think it'd be okay then?
[05:12:40] <sd> 15<山​姆> I can always teach that to someone
[05:12:59] <sd> 15<山​姆> £40k + shares + totally wfh beyond maybe some exceptional travel to social gatherings, company events, or potentially some data centre travel if we ever broke iDRAC/IPMI
[05:13:43] <xe0n> it sounds like you want someone to do support type stuff, and then someone who manages infrastructure.
[05:13:43] <BWMerlin> I think WFH is no longer a "bonus" but now normal and in some cases a requirement so not sure that is a super selling point
[05:14:11] <csws> why are you asking for javascript?
[05:14:13] <sd> 15<山​姆> Support is honestly very secondary for me, the main thing for me is rolling out AAD & MDM
[05:14:17] <BWMerlin> Taking automation out isn't going to help, IMO automation is part of any job anyway
[05:14:27] <sd> 15<山​姆> We use it a lot here, same with Python
[05:14:39] <sd> 15<山​姆> I could potentially get another 5-10k if it were to be quite helpful
[05:15:07] <csws> you use javascript on the infrastructure side?
[05:15:28] <sd> 15<山​姆> We do some fun web development bits so things are clickable 🙂
[05:15:29] <technonerd> infra as code in js
[05:15:36] <sd> 15<山​姆> IaC is not JS
[05:15:43] <csws> oh
[05:15:45] <sd> 15<山​姆> Just the bits that make it beautiful are, but that's more of a nice to have
[05:16:04] <BWMerlin> PMSL @ IaC in JS
[05:16:05] <sd> 15<山​姆> I would anticipate many people having Python but not JS
[05:16:10] <csws> did something like that at my last job but the js was very minimal lol
[05:16:27] <sd> 15<山​姆> The main thing for me w.r.t. programming is that they have exposure to it
[05:16:34] <sd> 15<山​姆> They can read code and interpret it
[05:16:38] <BWMerlin> Sounds like some kind of horrid nightmare
[05:16:42] <iphone> I code in yaml
[05:16:57] <csws> smh
[05:17:08] <csws> whycome not json?
[05:17:08] <xe0n> you're asking for an experienced engineer lol
[05:17:21] <sd> 15<山​姆> With a 40-50k budget, what would you take out?
[05:17:23] <sd> 15<山​姆> GBP
[05:17:49] <csws> anyway I'd take out "experience with" and replace with "familiar with the concept of".. and then you can describe something like terraform or puppet or whatever
[05:17:56] <csws> but if you put those keywords in yo'ure really asking for something a cut above what you're offering
[05:18:08] <xe0n> pretty much ^
[05:18:25] <BWMerlin> I would take out "provide technical support for end users"
[05:18:37] <xe0n> that is a role on its own...
[05:18:59] <BWMerlin> I would also take out "manage it inventory etc"
[05:19:07] <csws> any expectation of out of hours support? might want to mention it if so
[05:19:13] <sd> 15<山​姆> Out of hours support not really
[05:19:24] <sd> 15<山​姆> I will deal with that since it'd only ever be emergencies or execs
[05:19:25] <xe0n> manage inventory, support end users, do other dicky shit = a low level role
[05:19:46] <BWMerlin> I would clarify and define better "manage and support all systems used within business"
[05:20:01] <sd> 15<山​姆> xe0n - this is a small company though so unfortunately we're having to do small amounts of the stuff we don't like too much
[05:20:09] <sd> 15<山​姆> yeah fair enough, though it might be a bit vague
[05:20:15] <sd> 15<山​姆> Will need to think of a better way to phrase it
[05:20:30] <sd> 15<山​姆> It's effectively just aiding with the set up and management of security bits n bobs
[05:20:36] <csws> also saying "experience with at least one" makes me think you're checking boxes so I'd just say "Familiar with scripting languages such as PowerShell, Bash, etc."
[05:20:59] <BWMerlin> I get that you are small but those small things can and will take up a lot of time and make it hard for this role to do those top of role description items
[05:21:01] <sd> 15<山​姆> Thanks csws!
[05:21:18] <csws> what's this person's responsibility with AD?
[05:21:29] <sd> 15<山​姆> Yeah well as I said, my goal is to get someone handling this likely within 6 months
[05:21:39] <csws> like just resetting passwords or you expecting them to commission DCs and do GPOS?
[05:21:39] <sd> 15<山​姆> But for now it's kinda me and whoever joins
[05:21:45] <sd> 15<山​姆> But 10-15 tickets a week isn't too bad tbh

[05:22:01] <sd> 15<山​姆> csws - it's purely Azure AD and MDM, no DCs for us at the moment
[05:22:09] <BWMerlin> Didn't you say that you were about to double the number of users?
[05:22:15] <sd> 15<山​姆> Yeah we will
[05:22:22] <sd> 15<山​姆> That 10-15 is including onboarding
[05:22:24] *** Joins: NoxTurminal (~Noxturmin@user/noxturminal)
[05:22:25] <xe0n> you're advertising for two roles lol
[05:22:45] <BWMerlin> So 10-15 will become 20-30
[05:23:11] <sd> 15<山​姆> That is a reasonable point
[05:23:21] <csws> do any of your devs use linux?
[05:23:29] <sd> 15<山​姆> All of them
[05:23:31] <csws> going to laugh if you end up having to support linux on the desktop
[05:23:39] <sd> 15<山​姆> We only use Linux on servers
[05:23:50] <sd> 15<山​姆> Windows & Mac are all we support on laptops
[05:24:08] <BWMerlin> This role mentions nothing about Linux
[05:24:26] <sd> 15<山​姆> It's a tiny amount of Linux, I can handle that stuff
[05:24:35] <sd> 15<山​姆> I'd likely hire someone to take over that specifically when needed
[05:25:14] <sd> 15<山​姆> Right now my goal is to find someone who could feasibly deploy AAD and MDM within my budget lol
[05:25:37] <BWMerlin> Easy done, the real question is how well will they do it
[05:25:40] <sd> 15<山​姆> I can take other bits out and train but the AAD and MDM are kinda essential
[05:25:42] <sd> 15<山​姆> Yeah lol
[05:26:20] <BWMerlin> IMO 50k pound sounds much more reasonable but I am not experienced enough to judge
[05:26:47] <BWMerlin> Probably still a little low for what you are wanting but much more reasonable than 40k
[05:27:30] <sd> 15<山​姆> It'd be more like  £66k after shares tho
[05:27:36] <sd> 15<山​姆> minimum I'd say
[05:28:08] <sd> 15<山​姆> £53k if on a 40k salary I think
[05:31:07] <BWMerlin> https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadminjobs/
[05:31:33] <BWMerlin> Maybe also r/sysadmin to help write out the role description and gauge pay rate etc
[05:32:31] <BWMerlin> The link you sent earlier only has some basic outline of the role but you are throwing things like shares, WFM, no travel etc around so it is hard to get an overall picture of what role is
[05:33:17] <yuken> Why can't motorcycles be quieter? I want a bike but jesus they're loud.
[05:33:59] <csws> dude I work with has a CBR250 and it isn't that bad
[05:34:19] <yuken> I was thinking of a Honda Shadow. Originally KLR650 but eh, it's loud.
[05:34:24] <csws> also yuken you don't even have a license?
[05:34:35] <yuken> csws, I'm getting one.
[05:34:42] <csws> 4 wheels before 2 imo
[05:34:48] <yuken> no thx, way too expensive.
[05:34:54] <csws> lol
[05:35:00] <csws> i'm sure you can find something that's theoretically 4 wheels
[05:35:16] <yuken> Insuranec alone is like 10-20x the cost csws.
[05:35:18] <yuken> Assuming liability only.
[05:35:25] <csws> is it mandatory in your state?
[05:35:27] <yuken> yes.
[05:35:30] <csws> rip
[05:35:31] <yuken> sadly.
[05:35:40] <csws> hmm
[05:35:49] <csws> can you roll around in the mud, burn your ID and pretend you're an illegal?
[05:35:52] <csws> they seem to get away with it
[05:36:05] <yuken> kek

[05:36:28] <iphone> probably
[05:36:29] <csws> free flight to delaware if they try to send you to florida too
[05:36:32] <csws> which is horrifying
[05:36:41] <iphone> oh god not delaware
[05:36:49] <sd> 15<山​姆> It's painful as hell for me since I was hoping to hand off the AAD/MDM to someone with specific experience doing that, but I fear I may be out of luck a little

[05:36:53] <yuken> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO
[05:37:29] <BWMerlin> You can get someone, you just need to make sure that the role vs pay is right
[05:37:44] <BWMerlin> Really think about what it is you need
[05:37:58] <sd> 15<山​姆> Annoying situation with money at the moment. In a year I can probably give 'em a 10-15k pay rise if things go well, but nothing is guaranteed there
[05:38:27] <BWMerlin> Add that in, annual pay review
[05:38:33] <sd> 15<山​姆> There's also a 30% bonus which is fun
[05:38:59] <BWMerlin> Dude, you keep adding these little bits of info in, how are we suppose to help if you don't tell us everything
[05:39:02] <csws> @山​姆 yeah getting someone young and enthusiastic would be good, you'll just have to see the potential in them instead of worrying about exactly what's on the resume and you'd want to remove a lot of keywords from the ad I reckon
[05:39:14] <yuken> csws, car insurance at my age would be a whopping 1/20 of what I make a year
[05:39:17] <yuken> damn son.
[05:39:19] <yuken> and that's liability only.
[05:39:21] <csws> yuken, how much
[05:39:26] <csws> you'd die if you saw how much I'm paying
[05:39:30] <yuken> $2000
[05:39:34] <csws> per year?
[05:39:36] <yuken> ya
[05:39:41] <yuken> USD, so about a million AUD.
[05:39:44] <sd> 15<山​姆> It's £40k + shares + potential for up to 30% bonus depending on if company hits targets
[05:39:47] <sd> 15<山​姆> That's really it
[05:39:51] <csws> hmm
[05:39:54] <csws> suddenly I don't feel so bad
[05:39:57] <yuken> lol
[05:40:02] <yuken> 20 years old, csws :P
[05:40:05] <csws> that's about.. 1.75x what I pay lol
[05:40:18] <yuken> Young, white male and such.
[05:40:20] <csws> and my car is insured to 10k aud too
[05:40:22] <csws> still
[05:40:32] <csws> I got mine at 23
[05:40:40] <csws> I should call the insurance and sort it out but I'm leaving shortly so cbf

[09:32:00] <yuken> also SirWoofsalot - what's the cheapest/best way to convert USD to Euro, assuming many weeks in advance, without a card?
[09:34:40] <JollyRgrs> go to the bank when the going rates are your best
[09:34:44] <SirWoofsalot> I haven't had to convert between USD and Euro since 2006, and then I just asked my bank. No idea if that was the cheapest
[09:35:42] <yuken> hmm. I don't plan on carrying a debit card.
[09:36:05] <SirWoofsalot> Alternatively, you could put all your money in doggy coin. I mean, your money is useless then but at least you won't have a card :p
[09:36:29] <SirWoofsalot> yuken, I didn't ask for a card either, they can give you the cash you need

[09:44:51] <JollyRgrs> but 2x2D = 4D
[09:45:10] <JollyRgrs> well, he won't carry a card b/c he doesn't believe in the institutions that back the card

[10:43:00] <CableNinja> JollyRgrs, for the record, although 1) extremely stupid, and 2) expensive, you *can* print the chip portion, but you need a 3d printer that not everyone has the capabilities to obtain, and you could technically also print the magstrip too with such printer, however it would likely not function very well, but, the good (bad) news is, the magstripe piece is actually a taped layer on the card

[12:31:33] <SirSceptalot> why do you want to block facebook access?
[12:32:00] <JollyRgrs> lol, we have a company fb page... no chance it'll be blocked at my company
[12:32:00] <Kiernian> same reason I block twitter. nothing good comes of it.
[12:32:17] <Kiernian> actually, facebook is worse
[12:32:28] <JollyRgrs> Kiernian: uh...
[12:32:30] <Activ8> CableNinja you can't have a title as breaker of things and not break things
[12:32:39] <SirSceptalot> you mean things like malicious ads and stuff?
[12:32:40] <Activ8> lol
[12:32:50] <JollyRgrs> i know many security guys who get their first snippets of news about a new bad thing coming through twitter
[12:32:52] <Activ8> facebook needs blocking world wide
[12:32:56] <Activ8> it's evil

[12:37:43] <SirSceptalot> that's a movie innit?
[12:38:20] <Activ8> chucky
[12:38:23] <Activ8> it is indeed
[12:38:27] <Activ8> great film
[12:39:13] <JollyRgrs> i never actually never saw any of the chucky movies
[12:39:39] <Activ8> stick it on your list
[12:39:47] <SirSceptalot> I've seen a few, they were fun. Not sure how well they hold up, as with many old things
[12:39:47] <JollyRgrs> my parents didn't let me see R rated movies as a kid (so only when i was over at friends' houses)
[12:39:53] <SirSceptalot> [insert your mom joke here]
[12:39:55] <JollyRgrs> but tbh, never really was a HUGE fan of scary/horror movies
[12:39:56] <yuken> I need some 200 proof for-human-consumption alcohol. 
[12:39:58] <Kiernian> me either. from what little I've seen, most 80's horror seemed to be utterly atrocious, so I skipped the rest of it.
[12:39:59] <JollyRgrs> nothing against them
[12:40:11] <JollyRgrs> just... most seem to be kinda meh and waste of time
[12:40:27] <JollyRgrs> Kiernian: you need to see Killer Clowns from Outer Space though
[12:40:29] <yuken> It seems like I can't actually buy alcohol that doesn't have additives to make it unsafe for drinking...
[12:40:44] <SirSceptalot> what?
[12:40:49] <Kiernian> I have heard that killer clowns is so bad that it's cult status good. I'm still on the fence about it, though.
[12:40:52] <yuken> SirSceptalot, I'm <21
[12:40:53] <JollyRgrs> yuken: dude, srsly, just chill man
[12:40:59] <JollyRgrs> he's like 14
[12:41:03] <SirSceptalot> lol
[12:41:04] <yuken> JollyRgrs, this isn't for me to drink to get drunk lol
[12:41:07] <yuken> It's to extract stuff.
[12:41:09] <JollyRgrs> well, closer to 12 (mentally)
[12:41:10] <yuken> But it needs to be edible.
[12:41:25] <SirSceptalot> edible?
[12:41:38] <Activ8> I'm a big fan of old school movies i.e tremors, chucky, back to the future, batteries not included e.t.c e.t.c
[12:41:39] <Kiernian> I assume that "not wood alcohol" is meant here
[12:41:45] <JollyRgrs> when you think you can DIY the world and wing it all
[12:41:47] <Activ8> they are great films as not too much cgi is used
[12:41:50] <SirSceptalot> TREMORS
[12:41:50] <Activ8> can't stand cgi
[12:41:54] <SirSceptalot> god damn that was fun
[12:41:59] <yuken> SirSceptalot, in the US at least, we add super poison to alcohol so people don't drink it, when it's sold as solvents/etc.
[12:42:03] <yuken> Kiernian, ethanol, not methanol.
[12:42:09] <JollyRgrs> Activ8: back when they had to actually rely on good acting and practical techniques
[12:42:22] <Activ8> JollyRgrs correct, the best times ever for films
[12:42:27] <JollyRgrs> that's why my wife prefers korean dramas... b/c they actually have to focus more on acting
[12:42:32] <Activ8> they need to bring that style of films back and not use cgi where possible
[12:42:36] <Activ8> them are the best
[12:42:41] <SirSceptalot> yuken, that's probably a practice worldwide, I just figure "edible" isn't the correct term for a liquid
[12:42:49] <yuken> SirSceptalot, well, not poisoned to kill me.
[12:42:51] <JollyRgrs> i LOVE the use of CGI, enabling some of the great films of 90s and 2000s, etc...
[12:42:57] <JollyRgrs> but you gotta use the right tool for the job
[12:43:02] <Kiernian> I like CGI in stuff like "the expanse" because, well, outer space, but otherwise...yeah
[12:43:03] <JollyRgrs> and CGI isn't the right tool for everything
[12:43:04] <Activ8> too much cgi is bad
[12:43:11] <Activ8> things like
[12:43:20] <Activ8> flight of the navigator - amazing use of cgi
[12:43:26] <JollyRgrs> Activ8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
[12:43:30] <SirSceptalot> Activ8, I remember being awed at the scene in the "original" spooderman film where the actor actually caught all the items on the food tray
[12:43:32] <JollyRgrs> that's one of my fav childhood movies
[12:43:39] <Activ8> ditto...
[12:43:45] <Activ8> I might watch it this afternoon
[12:43:46] <JollyRgrs> Activ8: you seen the "about that movie" thing?
[12:43:53] <SirSceptalot> Figured that was CGI, but nope, he just did it a brazzilian time until he actually caught it all
[12:43:54] <Activ8> I have a collection of downloading movies on my backup drive
[12:43:55] <JollyRgrs> where they go through the cgi and how it was done?
[12:44:09] <Activ8> I haven't JollyRgrs but I will do soon

[13:06:59] <lenarhoyt> Hi. Does it make sense to separate data storage and PHP applications in two separate VMs? I am currently considering a Debian VM for the data storage (because it has a pre-compiled Samba package), and a Phantom OS + Docker VM for the app. What would be the best way of accessing the data storage VM from the Phantom OS VM?
[13:08:11] <xe0n> context...explain what you're actually trying to build
[13:08:42] <xe0n> and achieve, can't provide guidance on a solution if all you've said is oh i wanna separate things
[13:08:45] <xe0n> oookayyy
[13:12:09] <lenarhoyt> I meant Photon OS
[13:13:34] *** Quits: nun (~nun@178.115.236.156.static.drei.at) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[13:15:36] <lenarhoyt> It's an e-commerce system and the storage would contain uploaded files, thumbnails, a Postgres database etc. Another reason besides there being no Samba package for Photon OS is that it might be beneficial to update/snapshot/rollback the internet facing VM more quickly for security updates/patches than the storage, which is only used internally.
[13:16:56] <lenarhoyt> Then again, building Samba is also not a huge deal...
[13:26:23] <lancehead> wooo I wrote my first bash script and it seems to be working 
[13:26:33] <lancehead> let's see what it does when I get to the comments I forgot to comment :^)
[13:26:39] <Kiernian> congrats!
[13:27:10] <lancehead> also, apt-get upgrade on an RPi takes fucking abysmally long 
[13:27:26] <lancehead> At least the Pi's we're using 
[13:27:33] <lancehead> Takes like 8 minutes 
[13:29:06] <Kiernian> haha. hahahaha. Thank you, I needed that :D It's a nice reminder of how far we've come, that 8 minutes qualifies as abnormally long.
[13:29:54] <CableNinja> lancehead, probably too farin the weeds, but might be worth making your own installer / and maintain your own package repo so you can yank out shit that isnt needed

[13:30:28] <lancehead> This is eventually going to get turned into a script for Salt deployment, CableNinja
[13:30:33] <lancehead> So that won't really help us I think 
[13:33:07] <CableNinja> I guess, as long as you're only doing minimal install of the OS
[13:34:05] <SirSceptalot> reality check. Is €5000 for a preconfigured mGuard RS4000 as stupidly expensive as I think it is? It would be used only to provide VPN access to a single fabrication machine, and this access will be needed probably once in the next 5 years
[13:34:46] <CableNinja> why not just setup an openvpn tunnel or something like that?
[13:34:55] <CableNinja> seems a bit much for just a single vpn connection
[13:35:01] <SirSceptalot> it does
[13:35:04] <SirSceptalot> it seems insane
[13:35:16] <SirSceptalot> and openvpn was the first suggestion, but they refuse
[13:35:25] <Kiernian> the device is, like, a quarter of that.
[13:35:41] <Kiernian> so you're paying 3500-4000 for "configuration"
[13:35:48] <SirSceptalot> they support the mguard solution, cisco anyconnect or L2TP or PPTP
[13:35:59] <SirSceptalot> yes Kiernian , my thoughts exactly
[13:36:12] *** Joins: jab416171 (~jab416171@c-174-52-177-39.hsd1.ut.comcast.net)
[13:36:30] <Kiernian> Generally speaking, if you can hand-configure the settings in a VPN client, you can set up a VPN server.
[13:37:17] <Kiernian> add reading log files and being halfway decent at googling to that skillset and you can probably troubleshoot and fix the thing, too.
[13:37:36] <SirSceptalot> how do you politely ask someone if they fell on their head as a child?
[13:37:45] <lenarhoyt> xe0n, maybe there are other reasons for such a separation?
[13:38:01] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, ask them how the walls tasted as a child
[13:38:14] <Kiernian> I'd go with "pardon me, did you fall on your head as a child?"
[13:38:18] <SirSceptalot> lol
[13:38:25] <Kiernian> I now await to be asked that very question :P

[16:11:04] <epony> log4jbang
[16:11:25] <teh_f4ll3n> are we still on that?
[16:11:44] <epony> yeah, next week another module
[16:11:56] <thegodsquirrel> I swear I have never hated a word more than any other word 
[16:12:06] <epony> java is going to get the best publicity
[16:12:21] <epony> google loooves oracle
[16:12:27] <thegodsquirrel> You know its on 3 billion devices....
[16:12:33] <thegodsquirrel> yeah we know NOW
[16:12:43] <SirSceptalot> lol
[16:13:14] <epony> mysql stored procedures when?
[16:13:20] <thegodsquirrel> Then you have all the knuckleheads who are like "We are on 1.x, we are safe.."
[16:13:31] <epony> "very"
[16:13:33] <thegodsquirrel> You know how that's worse, right?
[16:13:43] <SirSceptalot> they can't hack my firewall, we don't have one!

[16:15:17] * thegodsquirrel lands in the muck, where they belong
[16:15:43] <SirSceptalot> they?
[16:15:49] <SirSceptalot> how many of him are there?
[16:16:10] <thegodsquirrel> poor wording
[16:16:21] <epony> schroedinger respawns
[16:16:59] <epony> we're forever indebted to Apache for housing all that Java crapware
[16:17:14] <estranger> what's blue yeti
[16:17:21] <epony> some mic?
[16:17:27] <SirSceptalot> yeah
[16:17:28] <estranger> I like Krisp cus it works on any device
[16:17:33] <SirSceptalot> Yeti is the brand
[16:17:42] <estranger> and I'm often wireless and wandering around
[16:18:05] <SirSceptalot> I'm also wireless
[16:18:15] <estranger> I think better when I'm on the move
[16:18:26] <epony> larger than a classic doll head, not going back in the luggage
[16:19:10] <epony> yeeti yeeeti, neever gonna geeetit (never gonna give you up)
[16:19:11] <teh_f4ll3n> SirSceptalot, Blue is the brand. Yeti is the model
[16:19:20] <SirSceptalot> wat
[16:19:26] <SirSceptalot> hold up
[16:19:44] <SirSceptalot> well shit
[16:19:53] <SirSceptalot> looks like I got that all backwards
[16:19:56] <SirSceptalot> lol
[16:20:04] <teh_f4ll3n> there's also Blue Snowball and Blue Snowball iCE
[16:20:07] <thegodsquirrel> Check out my new Focus Ford
[16:20:10] <thegodsquirrel> xD
[16:20:21] <SirSceptalot> lol
[16:22:55] <estranger> and what's an eq have to do with noise cancelling?
[16:23:29] <epony> not much, but.. it can suppress or boos some "regions" (bands)
[16:23:52] <estranger> does it have a "piss hitting porcelain" band?
[16:23:58] <epony> so if you have a region of the spectrum with noise you attennuate that
[16:24:19] <epony> like hum or feedback
[16:24:25] <epony> or line noise
[16:24:30] <epony> or a fan
[16:24:43] <thegodsquirrel> or lancehead peeing
[16:24:48] <epony> such narrow frequency noises can be suppressed
[16:25:01] <epony> that's more complex..
[16:25:18] <teh_f4ll3n> there's a setting for that. called "a hit"
[16:25:22] <epony> cause there are echoed droplets and crackling porcellain
[16:25:49] <epony> pee noises are hard to fix, cause your ears are razor sharp tuned to that
[16:26:12] <epony> (don't ask why)
[16:26:20] <teh_f4ll3n> why would you have a mic in the bathroom? :D
[16:26:21] <thegodsquirrel> Why?
[16:26:34] <epony> whynot ;-) that's where webcams live
[16:27:10] <teh_f4ll3n> then why would you want to cancel out someone's "live stream"?
[16:27:12] <teh_f4ll3n> :D
[16:27:27] <javi404> anyone use cloudflare?
[16:27:38] <SirSceptalot> I'm sure some people do

[18:07:42] <vinrock> my state banned plastic bangs... and also paper bags?
[18:07:47] <vinrock> ohhhhkay
[18:07:58] <yuken> wut
[18:08:09] <vinrock> according to this article im reading
[18:08:12] <vinrock> new nj laws for 2022
[18:08:28] <vinrock> grocery stores can no longer give out plastic bags, or paper bags
[18:08:31] <vinrock> you gotta figure it out
[18:09:07] <SirSceptalot> "give out", but sell is ok? So they can just charge you a cent per bag?
[18:09:39] <vinrock> only reusable bangs iirc
[18:09:55] <vinrock> so idk, a buck a pop?
[18:09:58] <SirSceptalot> look are we talking about things you carry shit in or your hair?
[18:10:12] <vinrock> oh yeah
[18:10:14] <vinrock> whered that n come from
[18:10:30] <SirSceptalot> that sounds awfully racist man
[18:11:03] <vinrock> thats probably because im a racist
[18:11:10] <SirSceptalot> oh ok then
[18:11:41] <SirSceptalot> anyway, we've had an "only reusable bags" thing here for a bit now too
[18:11:58] <SirSceptalot> we never had paper bags here
[18:12:03] <vinrock> ive only ever heard of it for plastic bags
[18:12:10] <vinrock> we have a plastic bag ban in my town already
[18:12:29] <vinrock> went to kfc the other day and got a shitty paper straw that stopped working half way thru
[18:12:38] <thegodsquirrel> I like reusable bags cause they hold more and I can make one trip
[18:13:04] <SirSceptalot> I never got paper straws. Paper seems like exactly what you should NOT make straws out of
[18:13:10] <SirSceptalot> then again, paper cups work
[18:13:13] <vinrock> im gonna run out of my bag stash soon and will have to actually buy small garbage bags for my bathroms :(
[18:13:13] <thegodsquirrel> Also, just saying no plastic/paper bags is not the worst thing about NJ
[18:13:26] <vinrock> no the worst thing is the people

[19:23:45] <PublicWiFi> um these are low-load wifi networks
[19:23:47] <DrGibby> seriously 
[19:23:59] <PublicWiFi> so we don't need to spend a buncha monies on them, nothing too serious is ever on them
[19:24:10] <catbeard> so again what features do you need
[19:24:12] <PublicWiFi> I've never used aruba but i've heard they are good
[19:24:14] <JollyRgrs> LOL... hotmail and outlook (free) emails are blocking sendgrid's public IP

[19:24:37] <catbeard> heckin spammers
[19:24:50] <PublicWiFi> other than that? nothing fancy
[19:24:53] <catbeard> PublicWiFi: get a hap ac^2 mikrotik easy squeezy breezy cover girl
[19:24:58] <catbeard> $55-60
[19:25:03] <mistiry> aruba wifi++
[19:25:10] <PublicWiFi> that's the second time someone told me ot look at mikrotik
[19:25:12] <catbeard> can literally set it up in 5 minutes
[19:25:17] <PublicWiFi> but damn their shit can be convoluted lol
[19:25:18] <catbeard> and disable PMKID
[19:25:33] <catbeard> it's called quickset brotha
[19:25:40] <PublicWiFi> aruba have a controller similar to unifi right?
[19:25:42] <catbeard> it means it
[19:25:54] <mistiry> PublicWiFi: you can have a physical controller or a cloud controller
[19:26:13] <mistiry> we had the physical and then moved to cloud
[19:26:13] <PublicWiFi> "physical" as in a *nix box with the software installed right?
[19:26:19] <catbeard> you can also do ap only dhcp relay for AD
[19:26:20] <PublicWiFi> or windows or whatever
[19:26:21] <mistiry> no it was its own box
[19:26:24] <PublicWiFi> hm

[19:29:01] <thegodsquirrel> I do like the SDN configuration
[19:29:02] <catbeard> syslog stream to papertrails
[19:29:04] <catbeard> done
[19:29:08] <PublicWiFi> really hate to buy a box or sub to the cloud for a handful of APs lol
[19:29:25] <mistiry> i think you have to do one or the other, but im not 100%
[19:29:26] <PublicWiFi> looks like they don't
[19:29:29] <PublicWiFi> hmmm
[19:29:31] <teh_f4ll3n> Ruckus is all in APs
[19:29:37] <PublicWiFi> ruckus is a bit higher though
[19:29:39] <teh_f4ll3n> just designate a primary
[19:29:43] <PublicWiFi> but yeah I've had good luck with them
[19:29:45] <thegodsquirrel> Ruckus can get fucked
[19:29:49] <catbeard> you can even write custom scripts to do daily reports
[19:29:55] <PublicWiFi> I might jsut roll unifi cause I hate myself
[19:30:01] <PublicWiFi> i've never had any issues with them
[19:30:07] <mistiry> i dont thing the cloud controller is a separate charge tho
[19:30:19] <mistiry> i think you get access via licensing the AP
[19:30:21] <mistiry> but again, not 100% on it
[19:30:22] <catbeard> you gotta do some weird firewall ruleset counter chains but meh
[19:30:50] <catbeard> easy enough to just implicit drop ingress egress and forward and add your whitelist conditions
[19:31:03] <teh_f4ll3n> unifi controller is a free dl and install
[19:31:11] <thegodsquirrel> ^^
[19:31:14] <int0x1C8> who needs wires, just mesh all the things
[19:31:40] <catbeard> weird thing is the quick pass traffic, you basically gotta hose your NAT to get that to work so not really worth it to me
[19:31:45] <catbeard> or whatever MT calls it
[19:31:50] <thegodsquirrel> Just don't do their cloud controller, remote access BS
[19:32:14] <PublicWiFi> yeah that's what I mean, unifi has the cost advantage for sure
[19:32:21] <DrGibby> bc its shite

[20:24:39] <PrincessZoey> we have one day in the office starting the 18th
[20:24:41] <Kiernian> sorry, got a phone call but.. yeah, the hahahahaha was because I've only ever worked for ONE company that paid for actual training for stuff. 
[20:24:46] <PrincessZoey> I fully expect that to be cancelled. 
[20:24:49] <catbeard> just set 15m wake up timers to check tickets
[20:24:54] <ptaav> say you have Omicron
[20:24:58] <ptaav> fake a mild cough
[20:25:14] <Kiernian> every single other one of them went on the "you pay for it and sign this piece of paper and if you meet 400 conditions, we'll reimburse you in two years" plan
[20:25:18] <ptaav> i've tried drinking redbull
[20:25:18] <fritzwastaken> lol I dont even know why I come into the office
[20:25:27] <ptaav> just makes the desire to nap stronger
[20:25:30] <fritzwastaken> all my coworkers are 3000 miles away

[20:26:58] <fritzwastaken> They have asked me if I want to, but I wanted to actually come into the office and have hands on with the hardware and racks
[20:27:03] <ptaav> so technically they didn't lie
[20:27:04] <Kiernian> Nice, ptaav! Most companies I've worked for all seem to be under the impression that training you at their expense just means you'll leave them for a higher paying job somewhere else. Efficiency? well-trained techs? pffft.

[20:36:31] <Kiernian> man, that trend annoys the crap out of me. Thank goodness for "everything" on windows.
[20:36:35] <teh_f4ll3n> I put a hairpin in an outlet as a child. Got a burn, a life lesson and ability to figure out electrical appliances...
[20:36:39] <Kiernian> I don't want to search from my address bar, either
[20:36:48] <ptaav> "god microsoft i have to stop eating my nachos to scroll past bing results!"
[20:37:19] <ptaav> i do think you should be able to order results, but sometimes i do want a web result
[20:37:33] <ptaav> and opening the browser is too much effort
[20:37:35] <Kiernian> when I want a web result I open a browser and go to a search engine webpage
[20:37:37] <ptaav> for i am lazy
[20:38:05] <ptaav> just let me lay out preferred result order and a search engine preference
[20:38:17] <ptaav> you'd win the hearts and minds of everyone
[20:38:26] <Kiernian> I'm lazy too, which is why everything giving web results pisses me off every time I try to hit an IP address directly
[20:38:28] <teh_f4ll3n> ptaav you're in the wrong field. should have gone into neural-cybernetic interface research
[20:38:44] <ptaav> is that a thing?

[20:41:49] <teh_f4ll3n> thank god it's disabled by default
[20:42:41] <ptaav> enabling both is god mode
[20:42:46] <Kiernian> I've only ever used it on boxes with weird render issues. some frankenhardware that won't display the mouse cursor and other things after it does a resolution swap to full screen and back or whatever
[20:42:49] <ptaav> i only have partial vision in one eye
[20:43:08] <ptaav> so seeing the mouse pointer is super hard. especially if the screen's bright

[23:30:27] <estranger> i wanted a pixel last phone but I was in a crunch and got a oneplus 8 pro
[23:30:32] <estranger> its -OK-
[23:30:35] <killdash9> have you tried a different cable. I don't know what you're talking about with Assistant popping up. I use only Pixels and never have that issue
[23:30:36] <CableNinja> I was lookin at some of the opensource phones and the like, but they're all kind of a disappointment, or are way expensive for what they provide
[23:31:00] <CableNinja> killdash9, yeah I've tried different cables and types of cables, it does it in multiple cars too
[23:31:00] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I've been buying the 'a' versions of the Pixels.  I have a 3a, love it.  Got my wife a 4a when her 3a broke, that's pretty nice, too.
[23:31:04] <CableNinja> its irritating as fuck
[23:31:18] <killdash9> my Pixel 6 Pro is close to my favorite phone ever. The camera is fucking amazing
[23:31:38] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> why the fuck do i need a training on trade sanctions
[23:31:39] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> If my 3a dies, I'll get the 5a most likely.  I want a 6 but I don't want to spend the cash on it.
[23:31:40] <PublicWiFi> whoa there's a pixel 6 already?
[23:31:48] <PublicWiFi> feels like tey should only be on 3-4... im behind lol
[23:31:56] <estranger> yeah ill prob get the pixel 6 soon... i normally get a phone every 2 years and just got one a year and a bit ago
[23:31:59] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lol Ninja I had to do those to
[23:32:02] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Avoid Iran
[23:32:06] <PublicWiFi> I'd like to have a pixel cause they are custom ROM friendly
[23:32:06] <estranger> pixel6 has the custom google SoC
[23:32:07] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Although the price doesn't look too much worse than the 5a, but...
[23:32:07] <killdash9> I upgraded from the Pixel 3
[23:32:42] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> That's a big phone, though
[23:32:42] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> iran and syria for sure are flagginhg
[23:32:45] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I don't want a phone tha tbig
[23:32:53] <estranger> pixel 3 -> OP8 -> ??
[23:33:16] <killdash9> The pixel 6(not pro) has all the same internals except smaller battery and slightly downmarket camera
[23:33:20] <estranger> do wait for the discounted pixel6 or just wait for the pixel 7
[23:33:31] <killdash9> Pixel 6a should be announced soon I think
[23:33:38] <estranger> i dont want an "a" line
[23:33:58] <killdash9> then stop being cheap and get the 6 Pro
[23:34:07] <killdash9> only like a 6 week wait right now
[23:34:08] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> The 3a is 5.6", the 6 is 6.4
[23:34:16] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> That's too big
[23:34:34] <estranger> yeah if there was no wait id get it.. i dont feel like waiting after buying
[23:34:34] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Although
[23:34:37] <killdash9> not big enough. My favorite phone ever was the Nexus 6. That screen was massive
[23:34:52] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> When you look at dimensions, it's only about 1/4" bigger each way
[23:34:53] <CableNinja> I hate that phones keep getting bigger
[23:34:55] <estranger> cant just look at screen size.. also bezel size 
[23:34:59] <estranger> yeah
[23:35:00] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Yeah, that was the screen size
[23:35:04] <killdash9> I still use it with a data onhly sim as GPS and music player in my car
[23:35:08] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Ok, that's not too bad then
[23:35:10] <CableNinja> I already have to stretch my thumb far af for my current phone
[23:35:15] <Kiernian> if they're going to keep increasing the size at least add in a hardware keyboard again
[23:35:22] <CableNinja> lol right
[23:35:56] <killdash9> I still have an old Windows phone around here somewhere with the sliding keyboard. Man, that thing was the shit in its time
[23:36:08] <CableNinja> tfw google wants you to pay $100 more for 5g for the same phone
[23:36:12] <Kiernian> HTC Tilt? Circa 2008?
[23:36:24] <CableNinja> 5a and 4a are the same phone, just the 5a is slightly bigger..
[23:36:42] <killdash9> I measured 450Mbps download with the 6 Pro last week
[23:36:43] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> I dont use my phone 4g speeds do everything I use my phone for
[23:36:46] <CableNinja> oh and a slightly smaller battery
[23:36:47] <CableNinja> smh
[23:37:14] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Looks like I can get $70 back trading in my 3a
[23:37:16] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> That's not bad
[23:37:29] <CableNinja> uhg.... anyway... yeah so I need a new phone and I dont know what to get
[23:37:30] <killdash9> could get more selling local on craigslist
[23:37:36] <vinrock> i have an iphone 8 i need to trade in before it gets any older
[23:37:41] <vinrock> vzw still giving $100-$350 for them
[23:37:44] <Kiernian> we had the choice of a tilt or an iPhone back when the first iPhone came out. I was the only person at the company who got a tilt, Everyone was all -- LOOK, I CAN WATCH YOUTUBE! and I was all Look, I can ftp into our file server when a client's network is down, download patches to a microSD card and fix things
[23:37:46] <int0x1C8> I like the notes
[23:37:51] <vinrock> yeah
[23:37:53] <vinrock> im a note guy
[23:38:05] <vinrock> gettin an s22 ultra when it comes out
[23:38:14] * AnonymooseReddtr yawns
[23:38:27] <int0x1C8> looking pretty hard at the fold right now though
[23:38:38] <vinrock> im waitin a while til the folds are thinner
[23:38:52] <Kiernian> I've got one of these on order: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/astro-slide-5g-transformer/x/28018271#/
[23:39:08] <killdash9> astro glide?
[23:39:14] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Slider phones were awesome
[23:39:17] <Kiernian> Slide, lol
[23:39:23] <vinrock> you know thats where the name came from
[23:39:34] <Kiernian> although it's indiegogo, so the astroGLIDE might be more useful, as I might be getting fucked in the end :P
[23:39:38] <CableNinja> I liked the LG V20/30 I had/have, but they stopped making up, and I really am just tired of the bullshit on my phone
[23:39:54] <vinrock> i had a palm treo back in like
[23:39:55] <vinrock> 2004
[23:39:59] <vinrock> that thing was rad
[23:40:06] <CableNinja> plus my phone is too outdated to continue using my banking app now, and the rear camera is toast

[23:40:46] <Kiernian> my phone is too outdated to continue using my banking app no <-- how the fuck is that a thing unless it's so old it literally doesn't support proper security protocols?
[23:41:01] <thegodsquirrel> Did you see that Blackberry has a phone that is falling off and not being supported this year
[23:41:03] <vinrock> they dont build em' like they used to
[23:41:15] <CableNinja> updates failed to install on the phone sometime back, and I couldnt get it to install so I just said fuck it and left it as is
[23:41:31] <CableNinja> the phone is like... eh... 3.. 4 years old maybe?
[23:41:35] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Can you imagine the conversation where the devs can say "yes, we want this app to not support 3y/o phones" and someone actually approving that? Sounds like my wet dream as an engineer
[23:41:57] <CableNinja> heh
[23:42:00] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Compared to needing to support Windows phone IE1 or whatever
[23:42:18] <CableNinja> but at the same time its contributing to some extreme electronic waste
[23:42:28] <vinrock>  "yes, we want this app to not support 3y/o phones"
[23:42:30] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Back at my old job we had to fight to not need to support IE10 I think. It was such a PITA

[23:42:32] <vinrock> timebombs used to be a thing
[23:42:45] <int0x1C8> used that one forever until it literally fell apart
[23:43:24] <int0x1C8> was pretty damn slick
[23:43:38] <CableNinja> honestly theres no phone that catches my eye at all
[23:43:44] <CableNinja> they're all pretty meh
[23:45:01] <vinrock> im gettin more cameras at least
[23:45:09] <vinrock> current phone has 3, i think the new one is like double
[23:45:15] <vinrock> SIX CAMERAS!
[23:45:24] <CableNinja> STOP GIVING YOUR PHONE CAMERA HERPES
[23:45:47] <vinrock> oh and if vzw convinces samsung to sell them the exynos s22 ultra, its gonna have an amd gpu
[23:45:56] <vinrock> thats kinda fascinating
[23:47:20] <int0x1C8> next space telescope is just going to be whatever the current iphone pro or pixel is
