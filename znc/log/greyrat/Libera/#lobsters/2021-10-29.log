[00:49:26] <technomancy> JAVA the stock ticker symbol??
[00:50:43] <argentum> the language itself is fairly modern
[00:53:58] <technomancy> earthy: if you measure a language by "crimes against humanity via memory issues in C prevented" then Java actually stacks up pretty well
[00:55:16] <iDrougge> If the language itself is fairly modern, what isn't?
[00:55:56] <technomancy> the ecosystem I guess
[00:56:10] <technomancy> I mean, "fairly modern" has a lot of wiggle room in it, as far as terms go
[00:56:47] <technomancy> "modern" architecture can be like ... almost a hundred years old when applied to buildings =)
[00:57:34] <iDrougge> Well, architecture is thousands of years old. Programming languages are ~70 years old.

[01:26:18] <companion_cube> iDrougge: C
[01:26:43] <companion_cube> C didn't modernise at all, for some reason
[01:27:31] <Teckla> At $work, we switched our product from C to Java, it now requires literally hundreds of times more RAM, heh
[01:27:44] <Teckla> Not that it matters, since RAM is so cheap, relatively speaking
[01:27:51] <Teckla> Just throw more hardware at it
[01:28:23] <companion_cube> I hear there's a lot of possible tuning of the GC, too?
[01:28:50] <Teckla> Yes.  People might be surprised to know that GC can itself cause lots of issues
[01:29:26] <technomancy> Teckla: is some of that due to UTF-16?
[01:29:34] <Teckla> I did a stupid several months back.  To prevent any particular JVM from taking on too much work, I put in some code that checked heap usage.  If it was >= 95%, it would send a message back rejecting the work.  The producer could then try the next JVM.
[01:29:43] <Teckla> Anyway, it was a disaster.  :)
[01:30:32] *** Quits: akspecs__ (~akspecs@user/akspecs) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:30:33] <Teckla> The JVM will *happily* sit around with 95%, 96%, 97%+ heap and *not garbage collect* -- even when the JVM is idle! -- and even though a garbage collect would drop heap usage to 5%
[01:30:58] <Teckla> You literally had to cross a certain threshold before the (idle gc, idle jvm) would even bother to garbage collect
[01:31:10] <meff[m]> well, that depends on the GC type you're using heh
[01:31:19] <Teckla> technomancy: Not really due to UTF-16, no.
[01:31:28] *** Joins: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud)
[01:31:31] <meff[m]> and depends on the thresholds/options you set on the GC type
[01:31:35] <Teckla> meff[m]: Yeah.  There are lots and lots of garbage collection knobs and levers and dials you can adjust.
[01:32:39] <meff[m]> Any time we need to write a service that acts as a sidecar or something else that lives aside from other processes on box, we just force the JAR to be deployed with a low heap size and optimize our app around that
[01:32:39] <Teckla> It has gotten to the point where you really could be a full time consultant just helping people tune their GC for their use cases
[01:32:56] <c355E3B> That's what Azul does
[01:33:07] <meff[m]> Well, it's either tuning the GC or figuring out how to allocate memory
[01:33:18] <meff[m]> pick your poison really
[01:33:34] <meff[m]> yeah we use Azul in production
[01:33:43] <Teckla> We use Corretto 8

[01:34:50] <c355E3B> we have to move over to j9...
[01:34:55] <Teckla> Anyway, yeah, GC is not a "set it and forget it" kind of deal  :)
[01:35:05] <Teckla> c355E3B: oh dear lord god.  you have my sympathies
[01:35:25] <meff[m]> for apps that need lots of memory in a hot loop, yeah the GC is definitely not set and forget
[01:35:36] <meff[m]> well need lots of memory and low response times in a hot loop
[01:35:38] <c355E3B> I mean, I guess if its good enough for minecraft it should be fine for us?
[01:35:53] <meff[m]> if you're willing to tolerate the pauses, then it works fine

[01:36:43] <c355E3B> yeah...
[01:37:02] <meff[m]> in Java we tend to "pre-allocate" lots of objects we send in hot loops, like say metric payloads, and by that I mean we instantiate a bunch of objects on app startup, and then mutate them as we go along

[21:26:53] <JordiGH> How do you say "red" in Greek?
[21:28:45] <JordiGH> Ah, erythro.
[21:29:07] <JordiGH> So instead of saying "red blood cell" you can say "erythrocite" and be more scientific because Greek is more scientific.
[21:29:34] <JordiGH> This is like how saying "amigo" is more friendly than "mellon".
