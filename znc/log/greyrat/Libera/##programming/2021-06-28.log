[05:16:39] <lavadonut> shouldn't the exit be when the 'while' condition is no longer met?
[05:17:04] <InPhase> Ideally.
[05:17:13] <InPhase> Sometimes that doesn't work cleanly.
[05:17:23] <lavadonut> you could put something in the loop that makes the expression not met when you have the desired result
[05:18:06] <PlanckWalk> Yes, it's a fairly common structure to do something like  while (moreData && !found)
[05:18:16] <PlanckWalk> And set "found" true when you find what you're after
[05:18:25] <InPhase> Calling break is generally considered more elegant than invoking a keep_going = True just for the purpose of extra flow control.
[05:18:52] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes you would need multiple breaks
[05:18:59] <PlanckWalk> Or a break-to-label
[05:19:03] <PlanckWalk> Which is icky
[05:19:14] <InPhase> But it really depends a bit on the surrounding info, nesting, and so on.  If you need to know if things are found after, then PlanckWalk's suggestion is better.

[12:06:32] <quarksbar> weird...i thought all this new and malloc malarky did something to stop loading data past the size defined. wow
[12:07:10] <quarksbar> then there are atleast 2 bytes bettween things before it crashes, how dangerious

[12:08:08] <quarksbar> it seems to be working as an array transparently, i hope to replace a regular array with new cause of reasons

[12:09:47] <deniska> you can also write bar[foo] and it would mean the same thing, at least in C, not sure if this trick translates to C++
[12:10:29] <quarksbar> okay 2nd question sizeof doesn't work for the pointer arrays, so as long as i am smart i can just use the literal math like, int arraysize=elements*sizeof(type); right?? it seems to add up..i think 300000 elements of unint8_t is decmale size 300,000, or am i insane

[16:24:34] <xeno> Inari: the core language was pretty cool. The libraries not fully that cool (they were fully focused on older real-time systems) but still usable. It's the state of the compiler and support that is the showstopper there

[20:25:13] <ollierees> I think I'm stupid whenever I program in it because I can't translate my thoughts and ideas into code as easily as I can in other languages. That may just be me, or it may be Rust. Only time will tell, which is why I'm sticking with it for now, despite the burden on my mental health.
[20:25:21] <john> do you mean, as your opinion, C++ is better?
[20:25:30] <vdamewood> john: Also nope.
[20:25:32] <pulse> C++ is standardized and mature

[20:28:05] <ollierees> Rust does have some cool features and ideas, but it feels like some reddit language that only exists because some sys programmers don't like manual memory management. The issue with Rust is ultimately opt-in mutability and lifetimes.

[20:36:58] <pulse> deniska, Linus was quite specific in that one post of his
[20:37:01] <pulse> as to why he preferes C
[20:37:05] <pulse> seems legit to me
[20:37:09] <ollierees> What constitutes a good language? All I can think of is language features and specification. The technical part is done by the compiler.
[20:37:25] <pulse> ollierees, efficiency, ecosystem, etc.
[20:37:33] <ollierees> C has limited features, but it's specification is simple.
[20:37:35] <oldlaptop> deniska: "functionally all OS kernels are written in C" is however an excellent counterargument to claims that C is obviously unusable by mere mortals, or C is trash that can't be used to write good software, etc.

[20:44:45] <deniska> funny how all stuff written 30 years ago is in a language which was popular 30 years ago
[20:44:46] <oldlaptop> consider the consequences of the following logical error in various languages, for example: let a be an array of 27 integers; write a zero to the 28th integer in a;
[20:44:48] <pulse> oldlaptop, idk if that holds in practice, but maybe in principle

[20:49:46] <deniska> C and C++ compilers already have a flag to yell at you when you indent things inconsistently with {}
[20:49:50] <snake> {} is superior
[20:49:51] <oldlaptop> I probably like python less than you do, but the indentation isn't why
[20:50:05] <snake> that's why most other langs use {} instead of

[20:51:34] <deniska> which is caused exactly by {}
[20:52:19] <ollierees> pyzozord, off the top of my head you could use an N sized hashmap with a count of each element, and if the hashmap attempts to put a number that already exists in the hashmap you return the number, but that requries O(N) space complexity as well as O(N) time complexity.

[20:52:48] <snake> i can't defend on all fronts by myself
[20:52:48] <pyzozord> ollierees: the problem states that you can only use constant extra space and you cannot modify the input array (aka no sorting)
[20:53:11] <ollierees> pyzozord, oh yeah forgot about that - no aux. structs then.
[20:53:12] <pyzozord> ollierees: the followup at the bottom asks if you can do it in linear time
[20:53:30] <deniska> one good thing oberon does compared to pascal is always implying begin and requiring you to spell "end"
[20:53:33] <deniska> also, lua
[20:53:55] <pyzozord> ollierees: the real solution is extremly clever
[20:54:16] <pyzozord> ollierees: use tortoise/hare algorithm for detecting cycles
[20:54:16] <ollierees> Is that solution in linear time?
[20:54:32] <pyzozord> ollierees: tortoise/hare will be linear time
[20:54:54] <ollierees> I did not know about that algorithm. Thanks for the info.
[20:55:08] <pyzozord> you can treat the numbers as pointers like so numbers[numbers[numbers[hare]]] etc
[20:55:26] <pyzozord> then you essentailly have linked list and can apply normal tortoise/hare to detect the cycle
[20:55:47] <ollierees> I was going to say the best I could do it in was O(Nlog(N)) for sorting then you can go through the list recalling the previous element and checking if it's the same as the current element.
[20:56:26] <pyzozord> ollierees: you can do O(N) time and O(N) space if you just use hashmap of frequencies
[20:57:03] <ollierees> Yeah, I know. That was the first algorithm I described. Although you would use a boolean value for the hashmap, and check if the boolean is true (i.e. the number has already been found in the list).

[22:18:49] <pulse> you're welcome
[22:19:26] <beeza> IMO, when writing software, it's important to get to something that works, rather than having like 5 layers of abstraction after 2 months while nothing is wokring. Am I somehow an outlier here?

[22:22:16] <pulse> too few abstractions leads to spaghetti code, too many leads to (as you've correctly pointed out) endless coding and no results
[22:22:58] <Guest9> thanks pulse
[22:23:01] <pulse> here's the secret, it's not pretty but that's how it works. to get good code for any program, you implement it 3 times from scratch
[22:23:15] <beeza> pulse: well it is true
[22:23:20] <kzootech> pulse: i sort of agree
[22:23:23] <beeza> I mean it's not exactly that simple
[22:23:34] <beeza> but this is also why I don't like spending too much time abstracting things
[22:23:34] <pulse> it's almost precisely that simple :p
[22:23:53] <beeza> pulse: well your unit is program, but sometimes you just do it in parts of the program
[22:23:54] <pulse> that's why when you're experienced in some subfield you know what abstractions to use immediately
[22:23:58] <kzootech> my approach tends to be to write something that works, try to write it well while also in the back of my head (especially early on in a projcet) that i am going to rewrite it
[22:24:01] <beeza> while keeping maybe CLI code the same
[22:24:07] <kzootech> or "refactor"
[22:24:19] <pulse> beeza, yeah it works on arbitrary parts of the code
[22:24:23] <pulse> but it also works on the whole
[22:24:45] <kzootech> if i wrote good code my refactoring will be a bit of a copy-and-paste job of old code into a better overall structure
[22:24:51] <pulse> to implement something right the first time you need either experience, or a massive amount of luck
[22:25:03] <pulse> you can't refactor architectural mistakes
[22:25:37] <kzootech> well you kind of have to have a nose for good general structure based on what you are doing
[22:25:42] <beeza> no you can't, but there is sometimes good code that is faily modular that is not too difficult to retain after a reachitecture
[22:25:47] <pulse> kzootech, which comes only with experience
[22:25:56] <kzootech> or luck ;)
[22:26:04] <pulse> beeza, yes, ideally you make your code modular enough to allow that
[22:26:08] *** Joins: wwilly (~wwilly@217.140.99.251)
[22:26:14] <kzootech> experience is not a good substitute for luck
[22:26:17] <pulse> but in practice this almost never happens. code gets hairy over time and it's a mess
[22:27:05] <beeza> but  yes, I think you should always try and write the best code, but write knowing that it is very likely that 1) you will rewrite it completely, 2) you likely don't know what good abstractions would be yet, 3) code will not be used because of changes in planning

[23:13:07] <pyzozord> it's essentially always looping  (n+m)/2 times, so that's O(n) right?
[23:13:38] <mrig> looks like o(n) to me, walking some kind of tree.

[23:16:47] <bjs> pyzozord: how are you figuring out the complexity?
[23:17:30] <pyzozord> bjs: "by the ear" really... just following the code and trying to figure out how loops behave as input scales

[23:18:36] <bjs> pyzozord: okay,  have you tried (for example) trying to count how many times each line is executed for some example inputs?  you know, if a1 == a2 == [1,2,3..n] ?
[23:22:05] <beeza> okay, so another question, what is more valuable, high level or low level tests?
[23:22:07] <bjs> If you get an answer like  3*n - 7  total lines, then you know it's definitely *not* O(log n) worst-case, but if you get something like 3*log(n) - 7  steps then it _might_ be O(log n), and either way you'll probably see what the real complexity is and why.
[23:22:33] <beeza> I think high level tests are more valuable than low level tests

[23:25:58] <mrig> pyzozord: I keep thinking of composition now when I see arrays, forget sometimes that they can also be just that :)

[23:29:19] <bjs> pyzozord: the way people usually approach this is by leaning on experience and spotting patterns.  When someone says "this is O(n)" the questions are "what does that mean for this code? what is n? what cases will give you that? what cases are better? what's the average?" etc.  But when you get stuck... what else can you do?

[23:29:54] <bjs> you have the code,  the code contains the answers,  you just have to use it and start counting things up and trying examples
[23:31:57] <bjs> Like, if you're looking at a piece of code and you're not sure if there's any cases where it does a linear amount of work... then you really just need to spend more time understanding what the code is actually doing.
[23:35:50] <mercenary> Or you use the super-scaler way, run the algorithm for 1,2,10,...1000000 iterations on 20 instances, average the results and throw them in a curve-fitting algorithm, then try to prove that what the algorithm says is true
