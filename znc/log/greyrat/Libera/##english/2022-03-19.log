[00:30:00] <Jong> Anyone notice that being polite seems to mean being indirect? 
[00:30:28] <Jong> For "I argue that", the polite version is "I would argue that"
[00:31:55] <Jong> Instead of "I suggest", it's "I would suggest"
[00:32:27] <OMGOMG> depends entirely on where you are
[00:32:37] <Jong> What is it about the word "would" that's polite. It's one of the most ambiguous common words in English.
[00:32:37] <OMGOMG> in southern usa, politeness often means being warm and friendly

[00:32:57] <OMGOMG> in britain, it probably means being indirect
[00:34:30] <Jong> There's so much about language that deals with accommodating people's feelings.

[12:04:53] <skyfall> Is this correct sentence? Don't worry about their comments on you. It doesn't matter. We know who you are.
[12:05:10] <skyfall> I'm concerned about "we know who you are part", because I usually see that in negative situations. 
[12:06:53] <Maxdamantus> "hold your horses" is a phrase you say to a person to tell them to wait.
[12:06:57] <Maxdamantus> you wouldn't say it to a horse.
[12:08:04] <Maxdamantus> "woah" is what you say to a horse, so it's presumably trained to recognise it.
[12:08:36] <GuiToris> I'm satisfied with what blkshp told me, but let me show you what I meant
[12:08:53] <GuiToris> It's not finished yet, I don't know how to phrase it correctly
[12:09:50] <GuiToris> 'Woah! Slow down, you're getting me dizzy with the pace you're setting!'   this is the current state of the sentence
[12:11:14] <Haxxa> I worked on a defense project in University for a year, (final year project), would you define that as a internship or what would you put down on a linkedin description? i.e. I developed an app and machine learning classifier, but I technically wasn't employed?
[12:13:26] <Haxxa> I was thinking of using this "Junior Software Developer (Intern)", but I was wondering if there was a better description for working with a company or agency but not been employed directly?

[16:03:06] <mhmd> Hi, which one is correct for a list of dates which had trades, trading dates or trading days?
[16:04:40] <FLHerne> "knowledge of cooking" implies you learned that cooking as a concept exists, which seems unlikely
[16:04:42] <mhmd> I think both are correct, I don't know if one feels more right than the other, or if there is a difference in their meaning
[16:05:45] <mhmd> oh there's also trade_dates vs trading_dates
[16:05:51] <FLHerne> mhmd: I'd say "days" in general, but there might be a specific term in your context
[16:06:22] <mhmd> yeah it's a database table name
[16:07:12] <FLHerne> OK, then it's whatever the documentation says it is :p

[16:31:44] <xau> mhmd, for a list of dates which had trades, "trading dates" would be preferable, as it is a list of dates which had trades, not a list of days which had trades.  The standard being, particularly in technical fields: if in doubt, prefer consistency, rigour, and precision.

[22:45:15] <GuiToris> TimMc, with aids, nowadays? :O
[22:45:18] <GuiToris> I'm so surprised!
[22:45:57] <TimMc> I don't have specific knowledge of modern screening procedures, but false positives are just a general problem.
[22:46:34] <GuiToris> you know, I would say a negative is uncertain, but I would trust a positive test
[22:46:38] *** Joins: diskin (~diskin@5.139.87.13)
[22:46:49] <GuiToris> there's somebody around who took 4 covid tests recently
[22:47:04] <GuiToris> I think because he didn't trust the result
[22:47:10] <TimMc> About 15 years ago I got a false positive for HIV after donating blood. They explained that there are two separate screenings: First an ELISA test that is *extremely* unlikely to have false negatives, then a Western Blot to double-check the positives
[22:47:49] <TimMc> The ELISA is a safeguard and is (I infer) a lot simpler and cheaper.
[22:48:00] <GuiToris> I am super surprised :O
[22:48:26] <GuiToris> Somebody just told me this recently, and to be honest, I got scared
[22:48:42] <pussipupu> it's the kind of thing you want low false negatives over all to start
[22:49:09] <TimMc> I may some of the details wrong.
[22:49:18] <pussipupu> I'm not allowed to donate blood :(
[22:49:25] <TimMc> For one thing, I'm not sure how this interacts with pooled testing.
[22:49:53] <GuiToris> TimMc, but this is an HIV test, right? They said aids to me
[22:49:53] <TimMc> I think I'm not allowed to donate either, because of the false positive. Very silly rules.
[22:50:06] <TimMc> GuiToris: Sloppy language, possibly.
[22:50:13] <GuiToris> probably
[22:50:26] <TimMc> AIDS is a syndrome, HIV is the virus.
[22:50:42] <blkshp> "[19:16:48] <GuiToris> there's somebody around who took 4 covid tests recently" lol, what an idiot <.<
[22:50:44] <blkshp> :D
[22:50:46] <TimMc> The test would be an HIV *antibody* test.
[22:50:50] <pussipupu> for me it's because I lived in the UK during the TSE thing
[22:51:00] <TimMc> I don't think they can even test for the virus, per se.
[22:51:07] <GuiToris> blkshp, there are some strange people around, be careful!

[22:55:13] <GuiToris> TimMc, I read an article about Freddy Mercury, and I learned something about aids, and I think if someone has aids, by that time it's pretty obvious that they are sick

[23:32:31] <LjL> but not only in the US does one refer to the US as "America". so it is a bit confusing not just in English

[23:33:25] <xau> GuiToris ^^
[23:33:31] <blkshp> I think because there is no way to refer to people of the USA other than Americans.
