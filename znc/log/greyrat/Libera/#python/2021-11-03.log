[02:17:32] <vdamewood> lionslicer: print("Hello" + " world") Will also print Hello world, but what's going on is that the + operator is executed on "Hello" and " World" then it yields a new string "Hello world". Print then gets this new string as its argument, and outputs it.
[02:18:34] <lionslicer> I see
[02:19:34] <lionslicer> is it analogous to printing a number as a float or integer and a number as a string? the outcome is the same in terms of what you see, but you're getting different kinds of data
[02:19:37] <lionslicer> is that it?
[02:20:28] <vdamewood> Kind of. In the case of printing an integer or a float, you need a process that converts it to a string representation, then output that string. With a string represenataion already, you don't need a conversion.

[02:38:23] <SnoopJ> lionslicer, the difference between `print("Hello", "World")` and `print("Hello" + "World")` is what gets "fed" to print() as input. In the first case, it gets two arguments, and will join them by its `sep` argument (by default a single space ' '). In the second case, the addition is performed before print() is called, and the single string is passed off.

I can flash in a errorhandler decorated function that wll return HTTP 200 but the flash

[03:32:57] <grym> vaio: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html  is probably a good place to start
[03:33:02] <SnoopJ> vaio, because the changes to be made were the kind of thing that is necessarily not backwards-compatible (e.g. changing how strings work). If you want compatibility between the two, the `six` library is a good choice

[03:39:32] <onelegend> py3 is really nice
[03:40:43] <InPhase> On the topic of the six library, does it or anything else provide a Python 3 class that behaves exactly identically to Python 2 str?  Someone at work just unearthed some file IO code that it would be nice to be able to delay updating.  It would be handy if we could just hack in something like str = somelibrary.str_swapin and a few other edits and get it going in Python 3 rapidly.

[03:43:32] <InPhase> Well...  I guess, how close are those APIs actually between Py2 str and bytes?
[03:43:52] <SnoopJ> they're the same type
[03:44:21] <SnoopJ> `str is bytes` is True in Py2 :(
[03:44:42] <InPhase> Oh, I see Py3 bytes has a lot of string stuff in that I would never use in a bytes object.
[03:45:35] <InPhase> Okay, maybe that would work for some of it.  Then it's about all the other library calls and what type they expect or return.
[03:45:42] <nedbat> InPhase: py3 bytes doesn't do everything py2 str did though.

[09:56:18] <desophos> i think that #2 and #4 are good style, but is there a better way to do this?

[10:00:42] <desophos> defaults.update(kwargs), right?
[10:00:58] <parv> desophos, That is not workable for more than few argument; gets damn too verbose
[10:01:08] *** Joins: gggp (~gggp@220-136-146-93.dynamic-ip.hinet.net)
[10:01:15] <desophos> but the defaults are still hidden in the function code

[10:03:16] <parv> desophos, A for loop over `default` items to set missing items in `kwargs` is what I am thinking
[10:03:48] <parv> As for being hidden, well document them so that default won't be hidden as such.

[10:12:30] <jinsun> your #1 and#2 are the common ways to handle this

[10:19:59] <desophos> the issue is that the kwargs are being passed through to another function, and `g` wants to set some of them while leaving the others intact. i'm not aware of any way to specify "kwargs except a and b" other than listing all the others as individual arguments
[10:21:04] <desophos> so documentation might be the best way to handle it

[10:23:32] <jinsun> okay you were asking about how to tell users about that, then yes you will have to document it
[10:24:22] <jinsun> you can rewrite the function signature too, but documentation is easier and less hacky

[13:52:11] <grawity> there's no word splitting, no | pipelining, no unquoting, etc.
[13:52:46] <weedmic> ok, so i could create a variable = to this line, and just put in the variable?
[13:53:12] <grawity> no, it makes literally zero difference whether you pass it through a variable or not, it's the same data in the end
[13:53:22] <grawity> if you need pipes and stuff, then subprocess.run("sudo vnstat this | cut that", shell=True) is probably how you do it, that is if I remember correctly
[13:53:36] <grawity> although I would try to avoid piping through |cut
[13:53:47] <grawity> because I mean you got python, you can split and parse things using Python instead
[13:54:16] <weedmic> but this is what I type at the konsole, it gets all the data, but displays only field 5.
[13:54:32] <grawity> yes, so you get all the data, then use python's builtin tools to get field 5 out of it
[13:54:49] <grawity> anyway, in the 3rd example there, since it already doesn't need any shell features, subprocess.run(["sudo", "vnstat", "--oneline", "-i", "eth0+wlan0"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE) is how subprocess is meant to be used
[13:54:56] <weedmic> i see if i can figure out the above
[13:55:20] <weedmic> ty
[13:55:28] <grawity> and if you want field 5, then you get that using Python's .split(";") and such

[16:05:18] <weedmic> om - i'm soooo close

[16:07:17] <bjs> ammarsalmi: dict(**{name: value})  or just dict([(name,value)])

[16:10:42] <zamba> but i need the index to determine that i'm at the second to last element, because that's a special case
[16:10:51] <bjs> zamba: fair enough
[16:11:07] <bjs> zamba: I mean here's a simplified version without the special case https://bpa.st/CJYQ
[16:11:08] <grawity> feels like it could be converted into having the *last* element a special case
[16:11:33] <bjs> zamba: and yeah, it feels like it's really the very last element that's special not the others
[16:11:35] <grawity> having the 1st or last item be special is less weird than 2nd or 2nd-last
[16:12:31] <bjs> grawity: you kind of need both here, because you want to turn {"a": {"b": {}} into {"a": "b"}  so you want to not create new dictionaries on either

[18:38:07] <Kabouik> Hey #python. Excuse me for the silly question, I'm a Python user but don't know it well enough to write it (been asking for Python training since years at work).

[18:42:03] <CrtxReavr> Then you tweak the global path to add /usr/opt/pip/.local/bin/ and add /usr/opt/pip/.local/ to a global PYTHONPATH variable.

[20:08:28] <SnoopJ> XJ8, I don't know about "difficult" but qutebrowser is such a Python project, you might want to look at its innards.
[20:08:50] <XJ8> Qutebrowser makes extensive use of qtwebengine to do the heavy lifting.
[20:08:59] <XJ8> Which is written in C++
[20:09:00] <SnoopJ> yea, guess that doesn't really satisfy "terminal"
[20:09:01] <bjs> XJ8: depends how "pure" you want to be,  because actually rendering things requires talking to your OS and/or GPU at some level beyond what Python does
[20:09:16] <bjs> if it's *purely* text based, then sure
[20:09:24] <XJ8> Lets say pure as in I don't need an external program to see an image in the terminal.
[20:09:26] * SnoopJ isn't aware of a terminal-gazing rendering engine that could be the core
[20:10:05] <SnoopJ> but as far as layout, libraries like urwid/rich would probably be in the neighborhood of useful tooling for that task

[20:12:19] <bjs> again, to make things actually display will certainly be outside of what any language can do in a "pure" setting.  If you allow yourself to make the same underlying calls to the APIs that the engines do, then yes Python should be able to do the rest ontop as well
[20:12:43] <XJ8> So I would have to make use of stuff like libpng and the like?
[20:13:17] <bjs> XJ8: well I think you're confusing two things, there's like the core interface itself and then you have some helpful library around it.  Usually these "lib" things are those libraries, they're often distributed in C

[20:19:00] <XJ8> You're right that w3m does some magic to make x11 display images. I can confirm on windows at least, that using emacs-w3m in the GTK GUI I can display images (Probably because that's what GTK is doing for me), but no such ability in terminal emacs. It seems that inline images isn't portable across operating systems.
[20:20:05] <bjs> XJ8: what w3m does will be something like using the X11 C library which is just some C code with some escape hatches that do non-C things to talk to the X11 server (or that the X11 server has those escape hatches to talk to the monitor/GPU or whatever) which overlays things on X windows or whatever
[20:20:39] <bjs> XJ8: if you allow yourself to use the X11 C library (e.g. a Python binding to it) then yes you can do exactly the same thing.
[20:21:17] <XJ8> I'll probably just forget about images and keep it text only because I want it to be the same across any OS.
[20:21:59] <bjs> XJ8: pure text things tends to be easier as there's some fairly uniform interface for writing text to the terminal, and there are Python libraries like urwid that have terminal-based UIs
[20:22:02] <bjs> in Python

[20:23:11] <DnzAtWrk> is there a numpy or pandas method allowing you to specify an argument for rounding method?
[20:23:22] <DnzAtWrk> up down or round
[20:23:35] <XJ8> Of course, I could just do what emacs did and not allow images in the terminal and keep it only in pyqt5.

[20:26:13] <bjs> There's not really a benefit to re-write those C libraries to be "pure Python" as the final step still needs some kind of escape hatch no matter what, and the C libraries are the universally distributable

[22:50:00] *** Joins: rpkilby (~rpkilby@c-24-20-208-106.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[22:50:22] <bjs> cvmn: it has advantages,  but has massive disadvantages (e.g., how packets might just not reach the target, or if they do, might not arrive in the right order...)
[22:50:42] <bjs> TCP guarantees that every chunk arrives at the other end and in the order you sent, which is uh... useful :)
[22:51:29] <cvmn> but udp can do that via the application layer (a library)
[22:51:31] <deniska> TCP is like a pipe transfering a liquid, and UDP is like someone flinging barrels at you
[22:51:44] *** Joins: et (~et@user/et)
[22:51:45] <bjs> cvmn: yes,  so you have to build things ontop of UDP to do the things you need
[22:52:01] <deniska> (abstractly speaking, in reality in both cases there's barrel flinging involved)
[22:52:07] <bjs> obviously you get the danger that you'll end up making a slightly worse version of TCP if you try add it all back in :P
[22:52:11] <cvmn> then we slowly become closer to a micro-kernel design.
[22:52:43] <bjs> cvmn: not really, I mean TCP is already sort of built on a UDP-like thing underneath
[22:52:57] <bjs> and everything is built ontop of something else
[22:52:57] <causaui1> han-solo: sorry for the late reply, but I think the problem is with rds proxy. the client has a very weird story about how passwords are being set. thanks for the response
[22:53:22] <cvmn> deniska: yeah, but i think both are flinging barrels, except that tcp has auto-reflinge in case no ack is received fast enough.
[22:53:22] <han-solo>  👍
[22:53:22] <deniska> people reimplementing something reliable on top of UDP typically chase different trade-offs than TCP made
[22:53:40] <bjs> cvmn: specialised use-cases will drop the "generic" protocols and build their own thing,  but often those specific things aren't good choices for everyone
[22:53:42] <grym> ^ i use such a thing, sometimes
[22:54:41] <bjs> cvmn: look at something like a torrent client, it's "the same thing" as what you describe, just sending a bunch of files to people but it uses a totally different distinct protocol because it's actually specialised

[22:54:53] <bjs> Peer-to-peer with lots of senders and receivers with very little guarantees
[22:55:19] <cvmn> i think fundamentally the kernel must only offer udp (no tcp) to identify which message to which process/socket.  only regret:  checksum field should be deleted from udp header.
