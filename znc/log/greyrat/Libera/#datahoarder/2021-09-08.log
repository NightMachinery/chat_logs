[00:02:55] <skye0_mobile> he's introduced as a playable character in BF2042, you can use his dog tags as your own in MP. I guess it's his presence at all. The campaign was short and sweet but it is still sad to see someone who was involved in this game pass away
[00:03:35] *** dasbootmir is now known as dasbootmir_away
[00:03:45] <skye0_mobile> i kind of liked him because he was the only character in BF4 to ever account for the human cost of the war. Everyone else was concerned about the power play between the US, China and the govt./leader in exile or whatever
[00:03:47] <ThePendulum> it does suck but I'm not sure if avoiding confrontations like that is the way to go
[00:03:57] <skye0_mobile> avoiding confrontations?
[00:04:22] <skye0_mobile> i like battlefield 4, i just don't want to be reminded of someone who passed away at the moment
[00:06:51] <skye0_mobile> i might get over it closer to the release of bf2042 perhaps
[00:07:41] *** dasbootmir_away is now known as dasbootmir
[00:07:47] <skye0_mobile> i've seen on the news that a member of the band Girls Aloud died, and I've had mixed feelings with a visit with relatives, so I guess I've not been feeling consistently good or whatever

[19:59:13] <evilgohan2> Recent firefox beta update changes the bookmarks and menu spacing to actually be reasonable again.
[19:59:25] <evilgohan2> Hope that makes its way to the release channel sooner than later

[20:07:13] <ThePendulum> still staggered chrome added an extra click to something as fundamental as bookmarking
[20:08:59] <ThePendulum> ahh nice there's a flag to disable it. for now.
[20:20:51] <KevinCarbonara> I don't even know how you get to the bookmarks menu anymore on firefox. It used to be ctrl+shift+b
[20:21:21] <KevinCarbonara> Why does firefox keep removing useful features, but they still have the 'bookmark bar'?

[20:28:07] <Hydragyrum> KevinCarbonara, on latest firefox the bookmark bar is hidden except in new tabs
[20:28:56] <KevinCarbonara> Was the suicide comment in response to my question about firefox's direction?
[20:29:18] <skye0_mobile> No KevinCarbonara, just dicked around on reddit
[20:29:41] <skye0_mobile> but yeah, Mozilla's getting desperate to stay relevant at the very least because the only other browser out there that'll work with most modern websites are all chromium based

[20:30:03] <KevinCarbonara> They keep trying to compete with Chrome by being more like Chrome
[20:30:22] <skye0_mobile> yeah. idk if i want to think about this without some alcohol
[20:30:25] <KevinCarbonara> and all that does is lead to firefox users saying "well shit there's nothing I like about FF anymore I may as well just use real Chrome instead of slow Chrome"
[20:31:07] <Hydragyrum> well, FF's got better licensing and no google botnet, plus easier to install on linux
[20:32:01] <skye0_mobile> yup
