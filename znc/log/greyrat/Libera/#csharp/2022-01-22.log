[00:00:10] <ap5> Mainly because it is hard to maintain, and that makes it less secure
[00:05:18] <Nasp> Neither would i
[00:06:21] <ap5> But i come from a firm where ... nobody cared, and we didn't get time to securing anything, so we was demanded to do whitelisting, and i hated it. Security by management is equal death
[00:07:16] <ap5> (i have switched to a new firm where we have three different appartments that have each have a view on security, and i like it :))
[00:09:19] <Nasp> Same here

[00:13:00] <Nasp> ap5:  27001 i think and is the other 9001?
[00:13:05] <Nasp> And then maybe one more

[01:39:48] <jonp> their argument is that the behavior of the previous versions was wrong and bad.
[01:40:02] <jonp> the only real issue is that it didn't land in 6.0 ("semantic versioning!")
[01:40:05] <jonp> ("lol!")
[01:40:33] <irwiss> yes, which is why it should've been sitting until 7.0, as nobody cared for it for 6 versions anyway
[01:41:02] <irwiss> it's not some critical life threatening thing that requires breaking change in .0.1 revision
[01:41:18] <irwiss> or even in a major version rev tbh :P

[02:49:20] <brianonymous_> anyone got over 32gigs in their machines, and is it worth it
[02:49:54] <brianonymous_> ive been noticing that im getting up to 75-80% utilization lately
[02:50:19] <brianonymous_> and im not sure if that means i still have 20% to go, or if thats some kinda scratch pad for winders
[02:50:29] <_genuser_> that's an invalid question.
[02:50:43] <_genuser_> moar RAM is better.
[02:50:46] <brianonymous_> i just notice that it never seems to go above that value
[02:50:57] <brianonymous_> you might be right
[02:51:28] <_genuser_> I currently have 16 in win7 machine and it's pegged at 14.9GB.
[02:51:34] <brianonymous_> interesting
[02:51:35] <_genuser_> in linux machine I have 32GB but I never really drive it that hard.
[02:51:57] <_genuser_> I have been planning to move to that as fulltime daily driver and I might be running more VMs on that one.
[02:52:28] <_genuser_> win7 machine (with 16GB RAM) always has a VM running during weekdays. Sometimes on weekends too.
[02:52:41] <brianonymous_> i was talking to a coworker about that recently.. i feel like thats always better with stuff like threadrippers
[02:53:01] <_genuser_> but if I launch two VMs, and each require 2-3GB RAM, oh boy, just go and do lunch.
[02:53:07] <brianonymous_> hah yeah
[02:53:16] <_genuser_> the linxu machine is a ryzen 3900
[02:53:40] <brianonymous_> we are getting to the p0int where everything is very containery hear at work, and core counts help
[02:53:43] <_genuser_> 12 cores or 16 cores. I can't remember. Because I'm only ever using it for firefox. lol

[02:56:48] <brianonymous_> lol yeah, thats what im thinking is happening here with my 32
[02:56:59] <brianonymous_> that im hitting some kinda page writing boundary
[02:57:28] <brianonymous_> lol yeah, im using 56gigs of ram
[02:57:31] <brianonymous_> go me
[02:57:46] <Suchiman> planing to get at least 64GB for my next machine
[02:58:04] <brianonymous_> im feeling you. i think i shall pull the same trigger
[02:58:07] <Suchiman> so far i'm going like 4 -> 16 -> 64 xD
[02:58:21] <_genuser_> assuming you're on 10, maybe 10 is just keeping that one available in case something quick happens and it can focus on processor intensive work first and deal with paging out and re-balancing the used/unused memory later
[02:58:27] <brianonymous_> it says here in task damager im using compressed ram??
[02:58:39] <_genuser_> I have 2x 16GB sticks in new machine. Looking to add another two.
[02:58:42] <Suchiman> brianonymous_: yeah that's paging from ram into compressed ram xD
[02:58:55] <Suchiman> which saves memory without incurring disk writes
[02:59:00] <_genuser_> at least if it was condensed RAM....
[02:59:05] <brianonymous_> hm.

[03:14:30] <_genuser_> or even in retaining certain bits that might contain keywords.
[03:15:42] <_genuser_> if it can hear hey siri or ok google, then can it also recognize words like "vote for" or "let's buy", etc. etc.
[03:15:50] <brianonymous_> it sure can
[03:16:14] <_genuser_> let's say it can recognize enough to hear and identify: "let's buy" "I'm looking for" "I was thinking about" and then pitch you commercials for that crap.

[08:32:03] <WillPittenger> Sometimes after the `throw` keyword, it suggests adding `System.Exception`, which would be fine--if it put the `new` keyword in between.  It thinks `throw System.Exception` is valid.
[08:32:59] <WillPittenger> Now it came up with `System.Reflection.InvalidProgramException`.  ????

[09:04:30] <MatthiasVance> fucked up your name, sorry
[09:04:34] <MatthiasVance> WILLPITTENGER WHAT IS THIS
[09:04:38] <WillPittenger> What is what?
[09:04:54] <MatthiasVance> By the way are you using Resharper or is this plain VS?
[09:05:16] <WillPittenger> Just VS.  Resharper is out of my price range.
[09:05:34] <MatthiasVance> Start writing code for money :D
[09:06:17] <WillPittenger> I've been legally disabled for over 15 years.  Haven't had a job in almost 20.
[09:06:34] <MatthiasVance> Are you doing open source then by any chance?
[09:06:59] <WillPittenger> For my own use.  Mostly to kill time.
[09:07:32] <MatthiasVance> I don't even know if you *want* a license, but having an open source project might qualify you for one
[09:08:09] <MatthiasVance> What are you building?
[09:08:37] <WillPittenger> YouTube downloader.
[09:08:50] <WillPittenger> Not satisfied with other options.

[18:55:05] <irwiss> lz_: i was in a situation similar to that... 1 lane bi-directional road, one side is mountain other side is downhill, i'm driving after 2 tour buses... and we meet at some point in the road... next is a superboring driving in reverse for 3.6km at around 15km/hr :D
[18:55:19] <irwiss> bleh
[18:55:27] <irwiss> we meet more tour buses at some point in the road*
[18:55:54] <irwiss> all caused by waze trying to re-route people because of traffic jam
[18:56:21] <lz_> irwiss: when I was a kid we were going on holidays in some remote african places, awful roads in the mountains
[18:56:41] <lz_> my sister was telling me I'd be the first to die since I was on the ravine side
[18:57:05] <irwiss> lol the little shit :D
[18:57:07] <lz_> my sister probably caused me 98% of my ptsd today
[18:57:10] <lz_> not even kidding
[18:58:03] <lz_> she hated me because she was jalous as shit
[18:58:07] <lz_> jealous
[19:00:37] <lz_> completely fucked my life
[19:00:45] <irwiss> to be fair i find it scary to be a passenger when driving in dangerous conditions
[19:01:05] <irwiss> much more than if i'm driving, even though i'm not a control freak usually
[19:01:24] <Nasp> Yeah same here
[19:01:31] <Nasp> Especially those people who break waaay to late
[19:01:42] <Nasp> It may not be late to break, but as a passenger you just sit there thinking "BREAK BREAK BREKA"
[19:03:04] <irwiss> yeah... tho i found i changed my braking habits as i got more experience driving, braking way earlier saves a ton of fuel
[19:03:07] <MichaelLong> Nasp, good for, that you did not have to drive with your boss' overpowered audi to a customer meeting...
[19:04:45] <Nasp> haha
[19:04:53] <Nasp> irwiss: Also slow breaking
[19:05:01] <Nasp> Like busdrivers just slam the breaks
[19:05:17] <MichaelLong> it was kind of a binary driving style: either full throttle or hard break.
[19:05:52] <lz_> I may have exagerated with the 98%. probably 70, the other 30 being my dad
[19:06:01] <irwiss> yea i mean... slow down way earlier and just roll over... good odds the light will go green
[19:06:02] <lz_> who promised he'd crash a plane on our home
[19:06:41] <lz_> people who had a normal home have no idea about their luck
[19:06:41] <MichaelLong> I remember that day vividly, the boss wife told him not to drive to fast, it was a rainy snowy day, and he asks us if it is ok to drive not faster than 240 km/h
[19:07:13] <Nasp> 240?
[19:07:21] <Nasp> So straight to jail eh
[19:07:23] <MichaelLong> yeah we settled on 200 km/h
[19:07:31] <Nasp> Or is this german autobahn
[19:07:34] <lz_> your boss sounds like a dumb fuck
[19:07:42] <MichaelLong> ah yes sorry, forgot to mention
[19:08:08] <Nasp> We just got a law if you drive more than 200km/h or more than 100% of the legal speed limit, then police take your car immediately
[19:08:09] <irwiss> even on autobahn it's supershitty to drive at high speed in the rain
[19:08:09] <lz_> which is probably why he's the boss
[19:08:46] <Nasp> The same goes for high alcohol blood percentage, drugs, driving like a maniac
[19:09:08] <MichaelLong> depends a bit on the rain and traffic situation, but yes I don't go over 160 km/h
[19:09:22] <Suchiman> MichaelLong: german autobahn <3 xD
[19:09:47] <Suchiman> seen a video the other day of someone in a buggatti chiron doing 417km/h on the german autobahn
[19:09:56] <Nasp> No matter how fast you drive there's always some car going past you are light speed on autobahn
[19:10:01] <MichaelLong> lz_, no he's actually a very good boss. but I've a saying that some people change their character when on the autobahn
[19:10:07] <Nasp> I've never understood the no limit rule
[19:10:12] <Nasp> Also isn't it only some autobahns now
[19:10:20] <irwiss> Nasp: https://youtu.be/7pg1hhW5qhM
[19:10:38] <Nasp> Is that a video game
[19:10:40] <irwiss> but good road conditions and a proper car allow for such stuff
[19:10:41] <MichaelLong> Suchiman, top gear?
[19:10:43] <Nasp> Or is it just a really bad camera
[19:10:56] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah many autobahns have restrictions to like 130km/h but the larger autobahns that connect the large parts of germany are usually unlimited
[19:11:13] <Suchiman> MichaelLong: nah, some czech millionary or something
[19:11:15] <Nasp> Wjat
[19:11:25] <Nasp> What's your break length at 400km/h?
[19:11:31] <Suchiman> Nasp: 1.8km
[19:11:53] <Nasp> I would imagine
[19:11:55] <Nasp> Youi can't emergency break
[19:11:58] <Nasp> The car would spin around
[19:12:07] <irwiss> Nasp: i'm guessing most cameras will have sensor issues recording at such speeds
[19:12:15] <Nasp> Imagine being killed by someone who just wanted to test how fast he could go so could put it up on youtube
[19:12:20] <lz_> Nasp: against a very hard wall it can be a very short break distance
[19:12:21] <irwiss> center of the image is fine, it's just the sides not getting enough light on the sensor
[19:12:25] <Suchiman> Nasp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pg1hhW5qhM
[19:12:31] <MichaelLong> the germany autobahn is often described in a too glorified ways. traffic is very often quite dense on main streches, there are already permanent or temporary speed limits.
[19:12:33] <Nasp> irwiss:  Those sensors can capture you at 250km just fine if i remember
[19:12:36] <Nasp> Dunno about faster
[19:12:52] <Nasp> Also did you see that new ISA thing in EU
[19:12:59] <Nasp> Where manufactuers can put in speed limiters now
[19:13:13] <lz_> maybe some people go very fast just to dilate time a bit

[19:14:33] <Nasp> It consists of 4 parts
[19:14:51] <MichaelLong> e.g. my car cannot go faster thatn 250 km/h although I would do much more anyways
[19:15:06] <lz_> I never owned a car ask me anything
[19:15:15] * irwiss wants waymo to expand
[19:15:34] <Nasp> Also i hate when people say you can't go faster than light due to e=mc^2
[19:15:35] <irwiss> would love to sleep or do something productive instead of wasting time driving
[19:15:40] <Nasp> Then i try and ask them why and they can't answer
[19:16:54] <lz_> Nasp: actually you can go faster than light in some medium I think
[19:17:12] <MichaelLong> Nasp, it's because of the laws of physics :D
[19:18:05] <Nasp> But if you mention the formula, then i would expect youi top be able to explain why
[19:18:13] <irwiss> lz_: no, speed of light is the speed limit of the universe... if you go faster (even if you omit the part where you need infinite energy) you break a bunch of physics
[19:18:14] <lz_> In some materials where light travels at speed c/n (where n is the refractive index) other particles can travel faster than c/n (but still slower than c), leading to Cherenkov radiation (see phase velocity below). ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light )
[19:18:27] <lz_> irwiss: I didn't say faster than c, I said faster than light :)
[19:18:40] * lz_ is a physics nerd
[19:19:44] <Nasp> You can't go faster than lgiht speed, but you can go faster than lightspeed?
[19:20:04] <lz_> c is not "the speed of light", the speed of light can change depending on what it travels in
[19:20:17] <Nasp> Are you sure you are a physics nerd?
[19:20:21] <lz_> yes
[19:20:53] <Suchiman> lz_: light always travels at the speed of light or c but the effective distance from an external observer may differ depending on how long the light bounces around in a medium
[19:21:00] <MichaelLong> c is defined as the speed of light in a vacuum, right?
[19:21:15] <lz_> MichaelLong: yes, the "in a vacuum" part is important
[19:21:23] <Nasp> lz_:  I think i would like to demote you :D
[19:21:38] <lz_> Nasp: have you read what I pasted above?
[19:22:00] <Nasp> c is not "the speed of light"
[19:22:33] <lz_> there's 0 contradiction in anything I wrote, read again
[19:22:53] <MichaelLong> anyways, 250 km/h is enough for me occasionally, alone on a nice summer night on the autobahn 2-3 times a year.

[19:31:14] <ironfroggy> Does anyone have experience with dotnet projects, in particular understanding how packaging and folder layouts work? I'm having a hell of a time understanding how to consistently get installed packages to work.
[19:31:31] <Nasp> As in how to get nuget packages to work?
[19:38:34] <ironfroggy> that depends on if I understand correctly.. are all packages installed by `dotnet add package` nuget packages, or are those only installed by a separate nuget command?
[19:41:08] <lz_> Suchiman: yes it was this one; tldw: the "bounce" or "absorption" models don't work at all, it's better explained by waves interferences

[19:43:04] <irwiss> cuts the fog like a knife
[19:52:05] <MichaelLong> oof
[19:52:07] <Nasp> ironfroggy:  Those are nuget packages
[19:53:53] <ironfroggy> I can create a brand new project and `dotnet add package OpenTK` and add a small opentk test program and it runs. but if I copy the exact same cs and csproj file into an existing project and run `dotnet clean; dotnet run;` the namespace is missing. I can't figure out what difference causes this.

[19:57:47] <ironfroggy> I just tried it again, copying the working code into the broken project, and this time it worked. I have zero idea what I could have done differently, so I have learned exactly nothing :-)
[19:58:18] <Suchiman> ironfroggy: forgetting to press save?
[19:58:46] <ironfroggy> I am copying the files  between projects with `cp` there is no save button to forget

[20:33:26] <MatthiasVance> I didn't change anything afterwards because it seemed still spot on (in the center at least :P)
[20:33:32] <JakeSays> how long is a floor?
[20:33:49] <MatthiasVance> the entire trip was 50 foot?
[20:33:53] <MatthiasVance> feet
[20:34:22] <JakeSays> oh you mean you moved it to the attic?
[20:35:20] <MatthiasVance> Yes!
[20:35:46] <MatthiasVance> Since everyone complained about the springs I would have expected it to give a little
[20:36:13] <MatthiasVance> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/cxyTXAE2/image.png
[20:36:13] <JakeSays> ah. lol now "a floor" makes sense
[20:36:20] <MatthiasVance> xD
[20:36:40] <JakeSays> you're printing all those creepy things
[20:36:52] <MatthiasVance> My son gave his lizard away but wanted a new one
[20:36:58] <JakeSays> LOL
[20:37:04] <MatthiasVance> Or rather, he would ONLY give it away when I promised a new one
[20:37:11] <JakeSays> ah
[20:37:40] <JakeSays> you should get some tpu filament
[20:37:42] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: why did he have to give it away
[20:37:56] <MatthiasVance> It's a huge coincidence that someone modeled some toy part which is exactly what broke in the second hand toy we bought

[20:39:35] <lz_> a computer
[20:39:46] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: an intel CPU
[20:39:52] <MatthiasVance> Ah are they are 12 yet
[20:40:03] <Suchiman> yeah
[20:40:16] <Suchiman> 12th gen is where Intel overtook AMD's single core perf again
[20:40:27] <Suchiman> and doing weird shit like having power and efficiency cores
[20:41:03] <MatthiasVance> I have a 7820X and don't feel like upgrading any time soon
[20:41:20] <MatthiasVance> The only thing I would upgrade is my GPU
[20:42:20] <lz_> I can give you my 1080, I only want a 3090 in return
[20:42:22] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays, Nasp : What I strongly disliked was that the OctoPrint status is not shown in the control panel on the printer, there is a plugin for that! https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/detailedprogress/
[20:42:43] <MatthiasVance> lz_: I have a 1080 with good clock, no thank you :D
[20:42:54] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i never look at the printer control panel
[20:43:05] <MatthiasVance> Oh not needed then
[20:43:23] <JakeSays> it's like 99% useless
[20:43:51] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I wonder if there's something I can use instead of glue, like a different kind of layer on there so I can easily take it out and immediately print again (and also not having to nudge the model off the bed)
[20:43:55] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: True
[20:44:28] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: bed weld if you could get it. i re-use it several times
[20:44:48] <MatthiasVance> Nasp was even talking about "bed ejection"
[20:44:53] <JakeSays> but nothing's going to help with nudging except cooling the bed
[20:44:54] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Btw what age are your kids, just be aware that these toys aren't necessarily safe and the children should be of a certain age
[20:44:57] <MatthiasVance> So print one, eject, print another
[20:45:19] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: When fully cooled (20C) it still sticks hardcore
[20:45:22] <Nasp> My control panel shows nothing when Octopi is in charge
[20:45:25] <MatthiasVance> I use Elmer's disappearing glue
[20:45:27] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: yeah i've thought of that too. i've been working on a design for a bed "bulldozer"
[20:45:29] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: And it doesn't work without glue?
[20:45:30] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yeah that plugin fixes that
[20:45:39] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  I have a different printer, i doubt it would work
[20:45:40] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: that's because it's glue. lol
[20:45:42] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Not with this PLA, worked perfect with the last batch
[20:45:47] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Yes xD
[20:45:57] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: My son is 3, small parts are fine nowadays
[20:45:58] <Nasp> Or is it some general plugin, hmm
[20:46:02] <Nasp> ,at
[20:46:05] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Just wanted to be sure
[20:46:11] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Thanks < 3
[20:46:15] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yeah i want a bulldozer as well
[20:46:20] <Nasp> Just a small shovel
[20:46:51] <JakeSays> i'm also considering using peltier junctions to cool the bed rapidly
[20:47:06] <Nasp> Why would peltier help
[20:47:11] <Nasp> As in under the bed?
[20:47:20] <JakeSays> yes
[20:47:24] <Nasp> ahh
[20:47:28] <Nasp> That could be cool
[20:47:31] <Nasp> Takes forever to cool down
[20:47:42] <lz_> taht's what she said
[20:47:42] <Nasp> I think 20 minutes or so
[20:47:46] <Nasp> It's a bit annoying
[20:47:48] <JakeSays> it would be cool. it's a peltier afterall .lol
[20:48:10] <JakeSays> Nasp: i use a fan to cool it in 5'ish minutes
[20:48:19] <ironfroggy> it is not. I have switched from Unity+VS. But also the whole point is I'm trying to learn how dotnet package and project setups work. the help from VS would defeat the purpose!
[20:48:34] <Nasp> JakeSays:  I tried that, can't remember the time
[20:49:39] <MatthiasVance> Resulting timelapse is 2 seconds, lol wtf
[20:50:25] <ironfroggy> anyway, i think i now understand the source that lead to all my package confusion: VSCode C# extension isn't recognizing projects that aren't top-level. I can probably figure that out, at least, and then I'll get the right warnings next time before I get so confused.
[20:51:04] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Put a container of dry ice under it, release some of it when you want to cool
[20:51:25] <JakeSays> dry ice doesn't last long
[20:51:43] <MatthiasVance> I had no idea what a Peltier junction cooler was, reading about it now
[20:51:58] <JakeSays> *sigh* amateur
[20:52:24] <JakeSays> it's not a cooler per se. it's a heat pump.
[20:52:29] <JakeSays> bi-directional
[20:52:49] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[20:53:21] <MatthiasVance> Don't forget you have lots more years ;) that helps with knowing things
[20:53:25] <MatthiasVance> I was estimated 23 today
[20:53:27] <MatthiasVance> wtf
[20:53:57] <JakeSays> LOL that it does
[20:54:15] <JakeSays> but that doesn't mean i'm not gonna have fun giving you shit
[20:55:14] <MatthiasVance> Likewise :P
[20:57:43] <JakeSays> i need to get the ota updater going on my clock so i can program it while it's on the wall
[20:57:52] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Well isn't that a given since no heat cooler exists, all of them are movers or converters :D
[20:57:58] <Nasp> JakeSays:  ESP32?
[20:58:06] <JakeSays> yes
[20:58:20] <Nasp> Mines in transit now
[20:58:35] <JakeSays> Nasp: no, not all.
[20:58:35] <MatthiasVance> What kind of print bed do you have again Nasp ?
[20:58:43] <MatthiasVance> I'm thinking of trying at least 1 other before always using glue
[20:58:56] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: seriously try the mirror.
[20:59:31] <JakeSays> don't know about there, but here you can buy squares of mirror the same size as your bed for super cheap
[20:59:39] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Ultrabase
[21:00:00] <Nasp> What are those things called in your skin that expands when you sweat?
[21:00:19] <Nasp> Well it has those kind of properties, so when heated it expend and open up some small holes in the print bed
[21:00:26] <Nasp> So the surface area is larger
[21:00:31] <Nasp> And when it cools down the opposite
[21:00:38] <MatthiasVance> Cons: Not compatible with auto leveling
[21:00:43] <Nasp> It is
[21:00:47] <MatthiasVance> weird :o
[21:00:48] <JakeSays> lol those would be called pores
[21:01:00] <Nasp> Ok i just wasn't sure because they are called the same in danish
[21:01:27] <JakeSays> you can use danish as i speak it fluently
[21:01:38] <MatthiasVance> knackebrod
[21:01:39] <JakeSays> no. i eat them fluently.
[21:02:17] <Nasp> We called it viennabrod
[21:02:27] <MatthiasVance> What happened in vienna?
[21:02:29] <Nasp> In Denmark it's named after vienna
[21:02:48] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  knækbrød
[21:02:58] <MatthiasVance> Ah I was refering to the swedish variant
[21:03:02] <MatthiasVance> Which is almost the same
[21:03:16] <MatthiasVance> knäckebröd
[21:03:26] <MatthiasVance> oh same thing
[21:03:31] <Nasp> yes
[21:03:44] <MatthiasVance> How do I get such a printer bed, can't find them for sale anywhere :(
[21:04:21] <Nasp> I dunno
[21:04:39] <Nasp> You could buy them at some point, mine was just a part of the printer since the company making these printers made the ultrabed
[21:04:39] <irwiss> professional actor right there https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/sa6p54/really_grandma/
[21:04:43] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: dude try the mirror:p
[21:04:44] <Nasp> I'm surprised i haven't seen them more
[21:04:57] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I'll try to get one for sure
[21:05:05] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: So gufi does that without any additives whatsoever?
[21:05:38] <JakeSays> so he says
[21:05:43] <JakeSays> swears by it
[21:06:02] <JakeSays> if it works then we should make beds using the same stuff on the mirror
[21:06:28] <MatthiasVance> Can buy a 150x150x8 (mm) poly finish for EUR 20
[21:06:31] <MatthiasVance> (mirror)
[21:06:39] <MatthiasVance> That's reasonable
[21:06:54] <JakeSays> that's not big enough and it's expensive
[21:06:58] <MatthiasVance> Shipping: EUR 20
[21:07:08] <MatthiasVance> Yes I was just entering some numbers to see what the total would be
[21:08:18] <JakeSays> i can get 9 12" for $17
[21:11:21] <MatthiasVance> this was "custom-size-mirror.nl" (direct translation)
[21:11:48] <JakeSays> ah custom
[21:11:55] <JakeSays> your bed is larger than 150 though
[21:12:57] <MatthiasVance> yes that was just their minimum size to check the prices
[21:13:03] <JakeSays> ah ok
[21:16:04] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: How many prints did you do before you tried bed weld?
[21:16:16] <MatthiasVance> Or did they just fuck up intermittently?
[21:16:56] <JakeSays> i used alcohol with moderate success for probably a month or so, but it started eating away the bed surface
[21:17:09] <JakeSays> so i switched to bed weld and plain glass
[21:17:43] <JakeSays> i picked bed weld because it's made by a veteran owned company.
[21:19:14] <MatthiasVance> Neat. Seems out of stock now
[21:19:30] <JakeSays> the bottle lasts a long time
[21:19:48] <JakeSays> usually i just go over it with a wet sponge to 'renew' the surface
[21:24:09] <MatthiasVance> I wonder if I should dilute the glue
[21:24:31] <MatthiasVance> It only needs a very tiny amount
[21:24:40] <MatthiasVance> So, take a bit of glue, dilute it, and paint it on :D
[21:24:56] <Nasp>  I used alcohol and a microfiber cloth
[21:28:02] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but you have an awesome bed
[21:28:10] <MatthiasVance> Mine is .. plain glass?
[21:28:20] <MatthiasVance> Thinking of giving PEI a try too
[21:28:42] <MatthiasVance> They consist of 2 layers, one sticking to the bed and the other as a (magnetic) layer on top
[21:28:50] <MatthiasVance> So you don't have to wait for the bed to cool before taking it off
[21:28:56] <MatthiasVance> Another solution to bed cooling .. no cooling!
[21:30:58] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i have a friend who uses that glue. i'll ask him how he applies it
[21:31:45] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Thanks!

[22:01:18] <MatthiasVance> Also I print exactly this print because it has tiny parts and fuckups are easily visible
[22:01:44] <MatthiasVance> Like right now I could see that the first layer at 1 point didn't have good adhesion because I didn't apply the glue evenly
[22:02:10] <MatthiasVance> And was way easier to get it off this time, maybe I waited longer and I was also above the print bed as opposed to in front (it is situated lower now)
[22:03:43] <JakeSays> one thing to keep in mind is that any variances in glue thickness will show in your print
[22:06:06] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: my friend says he just uses the glue stick directly and puts on a light coat, but only where he thinks it'll be needed on the print
[22:06:56] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Thanks for that

[22:11:55] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: JakeSays is a more experienced user, I recently started (2 weeks ago?)
[22:11:57] <_genuser_> ok creality ender 3v2, let me search oamazon
[22:12:19] <MatthiasVance> It's relatively easy to get started with it and afterwards you have lots of questions
[22:12:22] <MatthiasVance> Because things can fail
[22:12:24] <_genuser_> $279'ish USD?
[22:12:29] <MatthiasVance> yeah I think so

[22:23:56] <JakeSays> Nasp: this is an official espressif dev board
[22:24:04] <Nasp> Ahh
[22:24:09] <Nasp> I ordered like 12 i think
[22:24:31] <JakeSays> Suchiman: i dunno, but they're used for bearings and body parts, etc
[22:24:45] <JakeSays> Nasp: 12. cool.
[22:25:01] <JakeSays> i have five on the way
[22:25:10] <JakeSays> backed a kickstarter
[22:25:17] <Nasp> With 1-2 months delivery times i thought it was easier to just order a bunch
[22:25:44] <JakeSays> Nasp: 1-2 months for an esp32?
[22:25:47] <Nasp> yeah
[22:26:08] <JakeSays> from where?////
[22:26:18] <JakeSays> the moon? lol
[22:26:38] <Nasp> China
[22:27:00] <JakeSays> no one in europe stocks them?
[22:27:36] <Nasp> Usually at 2 x / 3x the price
[22:27:59] <JakeSays> damn
[22:28:12] <JakeSays> amazon has me spoiled
[22:28:27] <_genuser_> currently youtubing how to print moveable parts?
[22:28:28] <Nasp> Like when i ordered my stepper driver it was like 15 dollar a piece in Denmark
[22:28:35] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: about that lcd screen status plugin - it only works if your printer supports the M117 command.
[22:28:35] <Nasp> And i could order 5 x for the same prince on aliexpress
[22:28:48] <Nasp> I even sent an email to the webshop "Is that price for one, or a pack of 5?"
[22:28:52] <Nasp> "It's for 1 only"
[22:28:57] <JakeSays> _genuser_: you're asking?
[22:29:11] <JakeSays> Nasp: that's crazy
[22:29:32] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Yeah I didn't check that yet
[22:29:33] <_genuser_> JakeSays lol the ? was misplaced. I'm now starting to google/youtube instead of asking questions here (especially basic ones).
[22:29:41] <JakeSays> ah
[22:29:48] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Also people also turn around the glass bed and print on the flat glass :D
[22:29:57] <_genuser_> JakeSays pretty cool. sounds like an expensive hobby
[22:30:01] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: that's what i do
[22:30:05] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[22:30:25] <JakeSays> _genuser_: it's really not. filament is the only ongoing cost and it's cheap
[22:30:35] <JakeSays> especially in the us
[22:30:42] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yes
[22:30:46] <_genuser_> JakeSays so you don't keep buying more and more expensive printers?
[22:30:49] <Nasp> I ordered my printer on  aliexpress as well
[22:30:56] <JakeSays> _genuser_: well..
[22:31:01] <_genuser_> hehe
[22:31:13] <JakeSays> _genuser_: actually i bought a cheaper one the second time
[22:31:45] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Also regarding amazon it's not really a thing here
[22:31:46] <_genuser_> alright so sounds like it can be supported. Only need more space around your computer.
[22:31:56] <_genuser_> my computer area is FULLLLLLLLL of stuff.
[22:31:57] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Also it makes 50-60dB noise!
[22:32:06] <MatthiasVance> Also ventilation, PLA is non-toxic but still
[22:32:16] <JakeSays> you don't need ventilation with pla
[22:32:23] <_genuser_> 60dB is normal humm level?
[22:32:33] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: If you say so :D I think it's a bit loud
[22:32:40] <MatthiasVance> So I moved it to the attic
[22:32:47] <_genuser_> ventilation would be, oh geez, I'll be moving some of this to the garage.
[22:32:58] <MatthiasVance> Yeah, and now you want to control it remotely so you need a raspberry pi xD
[22:33:21] <MatthiasVance> Now you're happy you bought a printer on the cheap end
[22:33:30] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance I have 3-4computer running always, one or the other of them have fans screaming non stop. If there's ever a power outage.... It's tooo silent. I get irritated.
[22:33:45] <JakeSays> lol
[22:34:04] <MichaelLong> 3-4 computer... o_0
[22:34:21] <_genuser_> also the led lights. in power outage situation it gets pretty dark at night.
[22:34:35] <_genuser_> MichaelLong AT LEAST.
[22:34:49] <JakeSays> and being in texas where they don't believe in sharing power..
[22:34:58] <MichaelLong> glad I've gas lights inside my living space
[22:35:10] <JakeSays> MichaelLong: gas lights? really?
[22:35:12] <MichaelLong> ..kidding
[22:35:16] <JakeSays> lol ah
[22:35:20] <_genuser_> JakeSays sharing power with what?
[22:35:41] <JakeSays> _genuser_: y'all have your own little power grid
[22:35:44] <JakeSays> that sucks
[22:35:54] <_genuser_> why?
[22:36:37] <_genuser_> and none of that sharing is caring business/
[22:36:42] <JakeSays> i dont know why your grid sucks. poorly built probably
[22:37:12] <_genuser_> oh you mean we should share other people grids? Or share our grid with others?
[22:37:42] <JakeSays> well, personally i dont care what y'all do as the only ones who are affected are texans. lol
[22:38:15] <_genuser_> I'm not actually sure how all that works. I don't like the idea of utilities in the US in general. One company lays infrastructure, then city gives services rights to another company or the same company but generally to only one company.
[22:38:21] <_genuser_> then they have little monopolies going on.
[22:39:09] <JakeSays> yes, and those monopolies are heavily regulated
[22:39:19] <_genuser_> so ATT doesn't serve our area (I used to get internet with them before and liked them). But Verizon does this area. And has FIOS. But they also have the monopoly here. It's now Frontier Communications. But if you don't like them or their rates, you can't do anything about it.
[22:39:47] <MatthiasVance> Starlink?
[22:40:09] <_genuser_> I know electricity is the only one (now) that we can pick different vendors for.
[22:40:15] <_genuser_> it's a mess imo.
[22:40:52] <JakeSays> _genuser_: i have two options for wired internet - cable and dsl
[22:41:16] <JakeSays> _genuser_: what do you mean, you can pick different vendors for electricity
[22:41:17] <MichaelLong> here in my rural area I also have only two options, DSL and FTTH
[22:42:15] <JakeSays> it was just announced that we'll be getting google fiber here
[22:42:46] <JakeSays> it's about damn time
[22:43:29] <MichaelLong> isn't google getting a bit reluctant offering its fiber product? can remember but read something about it
[22:43:53] <JakeSays> MichaelLong: yeah i was surprised as well
[22:43:55] <MichaelLong> I mean, google is known to lose interest in their products all the time
[22:44:15] <_genuser_> JakeSays https://www.choosetexaspower.org/compare-offers/?zipCode=75010&m=
[22:45:11] <JakeSays> _genuser_: well no wonder you guys have such a fucked up power system
[22:45:19] <_genuser_> JakeSays you can pick any of those that serve your area. They'll become the provider over the existing infrastructure. I don't know how they pay the infrastructure owner in the back.
[22:46:04] <_genuser_> JakeSays good thing in this case is it use to be 14kwh and with competition they eating each other up.
[22:46:28] <_genuser_> JakeSays 9kwh, 8kwh, 7kwh, especially if you keep changing and locking in introductory rates for 12mo and then change again.
[22:47:00] <_genuser_> internet? You only have one choice Frontier Communications.
[22:47:27] <JakeSays> i only want one choice with power.
[22:47:38] <JakeSays> one choice that is rock solid and consistent
[22:47:57] <_genuser_> JakeSays these are consistent.
[22:48:10] <JakeSays> consistently bad
[22:48:31] <_genuser_> JakeSays power outage will be if infrastructure itself fails. overground powerlines brought down by storms.
[22:48:55] <JakeSays> _genuser_: and then you get hit with $9k power bills because your market is unregulated
[22:49:05] <_genuser_> JakeSays in the last 20 years, I haven't seen cause to complain about these (other than prices, which are now under control).
[22:49:25] <_genuser_> JakeSays never seen that 9k bill scenario directly or heard from anyone I know.
[22:50:48] <JakeSays> _genuser_: and the big power outage last year or whenever it was wasn't due to downed power lines - it was due to the fact that the texas grid wasn't connected to the rest of the country
[22:52:36] <_genuser_> JakeSays I know what you're talking about. The actual power shortage on the grid. We were exteremely lucky to not be affected by it. I'm sure that where not being powered enough came in to the picture. I don't defend that. I don't care to. We normally don't see that type of a weather on a regular basis. Should they have been prepared for it? I
[22:52:36] <_genuser_> don't know. But we pay the city/state and elected officials for that, so I think they should have been.
[22:53:31] <_genuser_> but not sure what would be involved in being connected to the rest of the country. Is it just running power lines from out of state to the grid and buying power? not sure.
[22:53:43] <JakeSays> yes
[22:53:46] <_genuser_> but then again that was once in 20years.
[22:53:58] <_genuser_> we see that EVERY winter in the north east and they still never prepared for it.
[22:54:28] <_genuser_> in comparison, I'd still rate TX gov't higher, much higher than more of the state gov'ts in the country.
[22:57:07] <JakeSays> well, things will get interesting when y'all secede from the union. lol
[22:57:10] *** Joins: highrate (~presonic@user/highrate)
[22:57:53] <_genuser_> Texans jokes about it, but I believe the supreme court has already rules on it and declared it impossible to secede from the union.
[22:57:59] <_genuser_> considering that whole civil war thing too.
[22:58:19] <_genuser_> lot of people died because lincoln didn't want to let go of a strong economy south.
[22:58:47] <_genuser_> don't think any state seriously means they can secede.
[22:59:16] <JakeSays> well, even if it were constitutionally legal it would be the end of texas if it happened.
[22:59:27] <_genuser_> no, why would it?
[22:59:54] <JakeSays> you'd never get UN approval
[23:00:01] <JakeSays> and w/o that, you're an island
[23:00:31] <_genuser_> Texas should be just fine. all state to state relationships would to country to country relationships.
[23:00:49] <JakeSays> i read an article about it recently.
[23:01:00] <JakeSays> well assuming the other states wanted such relationships
[23:01:02] <_genuser_> UN approval is largely irrelevant. But that's my uneducated-in-foreign-politics opinion.
[23:01:13] <JakeSays> it's absolutely not irrelevant.
[23:01:15] <_genuser_> the southern states would definitely want to maintain a relationship.
[23:01:23] <JakeSays> w/o it you can't trade with other nations
[23:02:13] <_genuser_> that's an interesting point. I haven't thought about it or researched it.
[23:02:19] <_genuser_> I would be curious how that would actually play out.
[23:02:55] <JakeSays> i was surprised at how much control the UN has over things like that
[23:02:56] <_genuser_> main reason why I never consider the eventuality is that I think the US would never let TX go.
[23:03:42] <_genuser_> imo, because that would either allow mexico to "annex" it. Or create the possibility of TX willingly joining Mexico (I don't think that would reallyhappen, but it might, lol, just to spite the union).
[23:04:16] <JakeSays> are you kidding? no way texas would ever join mexico
[23:04:41] <JakeSays> wish i could find that article
[23:04:45] <_genuser_> you underestimate conservatives hellbent on spiting the federal gov't.
[23:05:27] <_genuser_> let's not forget that without the federal protection, the mexican side (the cartels, etc.) might just start taking over some territory.
[23:05:39] <_genuser_> there are a lot of reason why I don't think a secession will happen.
[23:05:40] <JakeSays> ah here it is: https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/jan/01/stephen-marche-secession-might-seem-like-the-lesse/
[23:06:08] <_genuser_> secession talk is like samuel l jackson saying he'll move to africa if trump wins. But in the end, everybody just shuts up and goes about their business.
[23:09:47] <_genuser_> JakeSays interesting read. still reading. But georgia, imo would have easier time seceding in that military regard. I feel Texas would need to be highly armed to defend the south border from being taken over.
[23:11:11] <JakeSays> cruz is such an idiot: "I think we take NASA, take the military, take the oil." - they can't take nasa or the military - there's no way texas could pay for them
[23:11:24] <JakeSays> also not much of nasa is actually in texas
[23:11:31] <JakeSays> same with the military
[23:12:04] <_genuser_> I also do'nt think Cruz was serious about it.
[23:12:32] <JakeSays> the fact that he said it is enough
[23:12:41] <_genuser_> he said he wasn't there yet. Which means he's not really seriously considering it. or ever has. But he doesn't want to upset voters disgruntled by the Democrats

[23:13:48] <JakeSays> but then that's politics today
[23:14:11] <_genuser_> we had an example of why that doesn't work very recently.
[23:14:35] <JakeSays> why what doesn't work
[23:15:05] <_genuser_> the youtuber who ran for governor against newson in the recall. They completely ignored him because he wouldn't go on throwing mud on idiots. He kept actually presenting a plan on how he'd tackle homelessness, and many other prevalent issues. california fires for example.
[23:15:21] <_genuser_> and newsom kept saying oh noes it's a republican recall, elder will become the governor!!!! oh noes.
[23:15:43] <_genuser_> and elder was like newsom is crazy, the people can do better.

[23:15:57] <_genuser_> neither of them had any concrete ideas. All they did was pander to the crowd.
[23:16:11] <_genuser_> the third guy Kevin actually had a plan, but nobody cares because he didn't pander to their vanity.
[23:16:12] <JakeSays> or at least the majority

[23:18:34] <JakeSays> the only thing that might save a separate texas is oil
[23:19:23] <_genuser_> assuming this UN things was handled, imo TX would still need to have an army. to defend southern border.
[23:19:39] <_genuser_> you can throw oil on invaders.
[23:19:43] <_genuser_> *can't
[23:19:56] <JakeSays> yeah.
[23:19:58] <MatthiasVance> Pre-emptive strike
[23:20:14] <MatthiasVance> Also ship some oil to EU, we need it. :P
[23:20:23] <JakeSays> but oil is the one thing texas could use as a bargaining chip
[23:20:46] <JakeSays> for instance texas could join opec
[23:20:51] <MatthiasVance> Ah right
[23:21:00] <_genuser_> yeah I think that oil does give TX some bargaining power.
[23:21:13] <JakeSays> it'd probably be the largest opec producer
[23:21:43] <_genuser_> if it could take alaska with it.... then President Palin could negotiate a treaty with Russia from her backyard.
[23:21:51] <JakeSays> LOL
[23:21:57] <MatthiasVance> In our country we are also extract? gas but entire cities are getting destroyed by that lol
[23:21:59] <_genuser_> that would surely get some UN affirmations....
[23:22:27] <JakeSays> oddly enough alaska's oil production is less than 10% of texas
[23:22:52] <JakeSays> i could see putin trying to take texas for the oil

[23:23:27] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[23:23:34] <MatthiasVance> So we're talking about violence then
[23:23:41] <MatthiasVance> *force
[23:23:46] <MatthiasVance> Not necessarily violence
[23:23:48] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: it's both unconstitutional and highly impractical
[23:24:13] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance it was already settled in court that states can't secede. Plus we fought a giant civil war with very very heavy casualty cost because southern states wanted to secede.
[23:24:24] <MatthiasVance> Right, I remember that
[23:24:32] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: you were there?
[23:24:40] <MatthiasVance> The moment I pressed enter I knew it
[23:24:46] <_genuser_> probably from his history class.
[23:24:50] <JakeSays> lol
[23:24:57] <MatthiasVance> Actually .. I don't remember any history from history class xD
[23:25:44] <JakeSays> well, the way things are going, most of the kids in school here now won't know any either
[23:26:06] <MatthiasVance> What do you mean by "the way things are going"?
[23:26:37] <JakeSays> there's a huge movement here to change the way the history of this country is taught
[23:27:06] <JakeSays> you could literally call it "white washing"
[23:27:30] <viaSanctus> its actually such a beautiful continent
[23:27:49] <JakeSays> viaSanctus: what continent
[23:27:54] <viaSanctus> america
[23:28:02] <MatthiasVance> Oh, I did read about that. That is <insert word here>
[23:28:07] <_genuser_> JakeSays washing the white right out.
[23:28:28] <JakeSays> _genuser_: lol no
[23:28:40] <_genuser_> JakeSays imo, that's what's happening.
[23:28:52] <JakeSays> that's the exact opposite of what's happening
[23:29:22] <_genuser_> JakeSays imo, it's all about white people did this and did that. and now we're stuck with them and they totally suck. and also they didn't really contribute anything.
[23:29:38] <_genuser_> "but we should all be nice to everyone. ... but if you're white you kinda suck"
[23:30:02] <MatthiasVance> If you're a dude you suck too
[23:30:06] <_genuser_>  I see more and more people moving out to buy land, homestead, and homeschool kids.
[23:30:10] <_genuser_> imo, that's bad for our country.
[23:30:56] <JakeSays> _genuser_: yeah that's not what's happening. people are using CRT as an excuse to stop teaching about our history of slavery
[23:31:02] <_genuser_> that means people are disengaging from the country. when enough people do that, they tend to make their own collective. and collectives likes that start wielding economic power. then showing furstration.
[23:31:46] <viaSanctus> _genuser_ so you claiming people should ignore all what is wrong bc of "good attitude"?
[23:32:00] <_genuser_> JakeSays as much as I see CRT is being heavily taught. The same people incharge of all that do'nt want to teach slavey. They do'nt even want to teach books that mentioned slavery. But this is blamed on the other side.
[23:32:19] <viaSanctus> i dont know how, but somehow my android phone is suggesting a lot of "tell me you live in the states without telling me you live in the states"
[23:32:26] <viaSanctus> the stuff i see/read is unbelievable
[23:32:31] <JakeSays> _genuser_: crt isn't taught below the college level.
[23:32:32] <_genuser_> viaSanctus no, should teach everythign that was done wrong as: 1. it happened. 2. it has consequences. 3. it's really bad. 4. we should not repeat it.
[23:32:35] <viaSanctus> id expect it from 3rd world countries
[23:32:54] <_genuser_> viaSanctus but also that today as we continue to work together, we should value all people equally.
[23:33:08] <viaSanctus> but that doesnt happen
[23:33:09] <_genuser_> JakeSays imo CRT is everywhere.
[23:33:20] <JakeSays> well your o needs adjusting
[23:34:01] <MatthiasVance> What is CRT?
[23:34:04] <viaSanctus> we're all "logical" people here
[23:34:11] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: critical race theory
[23:34:14] <MatthiasVance> ah
[23:34:16] <viaSanctus> MatthiasVance some sort of civil rights theory
[23:34:22] <viaSanctus> i googled it myself
[23:34:26] <_genuser_> JakeSays I saw on yahoo back in 2005, a black teacher was reported as teaching, "if you're white, you're a racist". Then I suppose not many people raised a concern. But I've been noticing that type of stuff for a good while in education.
[23:34:47] <viaSanctus> lol, you had to go back to 2005 on yahoo?
[23:34:51] <viaSanctus> dude
[23:35:04] <viaSanctus> just googles yesterdays incidents
[23:35:05] <viaSanctus> :p
[23:35:12] * viaSanctus gets back to work
[23:35:51] <_genuser_> viaSanctus well JakeSays said crt isn't taught below college level. I was pointing out that it's been subtly being taught at a middle/high school level for a long time.
[23:35:53] <JakeSays> _genuser_: that's just a bad teacher period.
[23:36:45] <_genuser_> JakeSays they weren't disciplined or corrected at all. This has been going on enough to where even recently there was an uproar where the authorities was harrassing parents who complained about this . at high school level.
[23:37:16] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance CRT = cathorde ray tube ....
[23:37:55] <viaSanctus> _genuser_ if the guy was the actual government id take it "more" seriously, but we are talking about inequality on states level ...not some retard in a school
[23:38:06] <JakeSays> _genuser_: which proves that we need to change the teachers/administrators, not the curriculum
[23:38:46] <_genuser_> viaSanctus which inequality at state level? Are you talking about the teacher mentioned above?
[23:39:23] <viaSanctus> are you asking about which inequality specifically regarding this subject or generally asking about it?
[23:39:36] <JakeSays> lol
[23:39:37] <_genuser_> JakeSays imo, we need to teach honest history. the good the bad. and the lessons. the cost. what we shouldn't repeat. Teaching kids today that all evil is due to white people, doesn't prepare them for the world.
[23:39:50] <viaSanctus> JakeSays i dont even know how to respond to it tbh
[23:39:54] <_genuser_> viaSanctus you said: "if the guy was the actual government id take it "more" seriously, but we are talking about inequality on states level ...not some retard in a school" I just didn't know what that meant.
[23:40:20] <viaSanctus> by purpose? or cant compute that?
[23:40:26] <JakeSays> _genuser_: curriculum doesn't teach that whites are bad.
[23:40:39] <viaSanctus> ok what am i doing
[23:40:57] <viaSanctus> religious/politics debate aren't my strong points
[23:41:05] <viaSanctus> developing neither tbh
[23:41:08] <viaSanctus> i should shut up
[23:41:16] <_genuser_> viaSanctus not sure which inequality you referred to at the "states level". Bad curriculum? Bad teachers?
[23:42:14] <viaSanctus> _genuser_ do you know the % "black"/"white" ration?
[23:42:18] <viaSanctus> ratio*
[23:42:30] <_genuser_> JakeSays I'll be honest, I haven't reviewed the cirriculum myself. I won't ask if you have. I can only use what I've heard reported. Past that, I wouldn't send my kids to public school. Probably private schools where they focus more on science and financial education. I can focus on history during home schooling.
[23:42:55] <_genuser_> viaSanctus you're asking incomplete questions in incomplete sentences. it's difficult to follow what you're saying.
[23:43:17] <viaSanctus> _genuser_ i just dont know where to start and am puzzled you're not even familiar with the case
[23:43:39] <viaSanctus> i'm honestly baffled
[23:43:39] <_genuser_> viaSanctus I may have missed if you made reference to a specific case.
[23:43:57] <viaSanctus> are you seriously pretending you dont know of inequality in the vs
[23:43:58] <viaSanctus> ???
[23:44:10] <viaSanctus> bc if so, i'm not even going to get into further discussion
[23:44:27] <viaSanctus> pls type in google : inequality US
[23:44:29] <viaSanctus> and get back to me
[23:44:34] <MatthiasVance> viaSanctus: Your question wasn't clear to me as well
[23:44:35] <_genuser_> viaSanctus smh. You're just talking about inequality.
[23:44:46] <MatthiasVance> viaSanctus: And I'm just on the sidelines here
[23:44:55] <viaSanctus> MatthiasVance where are you from?
[23:45:02] <MatthiasVance> Same country as you
[23:45:06] <viaSanctus> belgium?
[23:45:10] <MatthiasVance> Ah shit, close
[23:45:12] <viaSanctus> lol
[23:45:15] <MatthiasVance> The one a little more to the north
[23:45:16] <_genuser_> viaSanctus you entered a conversation that was centered around the points of CRT being taught. You start talking about inequality - change of topics. difficult to follow.
[23:45:27] <viaSanctus> MatthiasVance, its not always as clear to us around here
[23:45:33] <viaSanctus> but the US is quite messed up
[23:45:44] <MatthiasVance> No viaSanctus I didn't mean the situation in the US
[23:45:45] <viaSanctus> i asked you that specific question
[23:45:49] <viaSanctus> rgarding CRT or in general
[23:45:59] <MatthiasVance> I meant I had the same view as _genuser_, that it wasn't clear what you were going for
[23:46:05] <viaSanctus> you answer me with my own question
[23:46:34] <viaSanctus> MatthiasVance i saw it more as a way to get into a conversation about the situation in the US
[23:46:39] <viaSanctus> i dont get that chanse often
[23:46:43] <viaSanctus> chance *
[23:46:51] <_genuser_> viaSanctus I was only saying I saw that CRT was being prior to college level studies (from the news). You query me about inequality. Two disconnected points.
[23:47:10] <_genuser_> viaSanctus but if you just wnat to discuss inequality, there's tons of it in the US.
[23:47:12] <viaSanctus> well, the reason why i did is bc of a statement you made
[23:48:00] <_genuser_> but inequality in general, you'll find everywhere. Not just the US.
[23:48:53] <JakeSays> i don't much care to discuss equality issues in the US with people who don't live here.
[23:49:12] <JakeSays> just throwin' that out there
[23:49:26] <viaSanctus> _genuser_: found it "imo, it's all about white people did this and did that. and now we're stuck with them and they totally suck. and also they didn't really contribute anything."
[23:49:37] <viaSanctus> you triggered me with that
[23:49:59] <_genuser_> oh no, I didn't. The CRT did. That what people report their kids are being taught in school.
[23:50:00] <JakeSays> viaSanctus: why were you triggered? it doesn't even apply to you
[23:50:05] <_genuser_> I don't have kids in school.
[23:50:09] <_genuser_> I don't go to school.
[23:50:14] <viaSanctus> and the "relativation" with stuff "not just in the US"
[23:50:37] <JakeSays> _genuser_: you need to attend 3d printer school, dammit
[23:50:43] <_genuser_> I don't care to an extent to be triggered by it. I think that's an incorrect view of the world. And it will ill-prepare the next generation to deal with life.
[23:50:43] <viaSanctus> are you even bothered with the inequality?
[23:50:52] <viaSanctus> voila
[23:51:04] <viaSanctus> "kids should deal with it"
[23:51:11] <viaSanctus> = better preparation
[23:51:17] <viaSanctus> thats insane
[23:51:19] <_genuser_> ok, you keep asking about  inequality. Do you suffer from the false impression that creation another inequality will fix the first one?
[23:51:35] <viaSanctus> what is "creating another inequality"?
[23:51:42] <_genuser_> no, I didn't say kids should deal with it. You're interpreting it incorrectly.
[23:51:49] <viaSanctus> help me interpreting it
[23:53:02] <_genuser_> ok, let's stop here. You're triggered by CRT. The statement above was essentially the summary at a high-level of what it says. You need to deal with it or find help. I don't believe in any theory other than everyone is and should be equal and we should always work to make that our reality.
[23:53:04] <JakeSays> so MatthiasVance how's that printing goin'? lol
[23:53:16] <viaSanctus> i was completely blown away by parental leave
[23:53:31] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Only did the lizard today, started late and took 2.5 hours :D
[23:53:50] <_genuser_> anything past that - that's your own triggering. You need to deal with it. Stop asking me to explain or interpret anything for you. Do your own research, never ask others to do the research for you.
[23:53:57] <viaSanctus> i wasn't triggered by crt
[23:54:03] <_genuser_> JakeSays ok, so 3d printing school.
[23:54:04] <viaSanctus> never claimed to be
[23:54:16] <viaSanctus> i was triggered by your sarcasm
[23:54:17] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: As long as I don't have 100% faith I don't dare to print for 12 hours :D
[23:54:41] <MatthiasVance> But I am going to do some bigger prints soon.. have an STL that is too big and needs chopping because it should really be 3 objects
[23:54:42] <viaSanctus> plus you tell me i dont understand something, what i can i do beside friendly asking you to help me understand
[23:54:47] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: you'll never have 100% faith unless you spend $100k on a printer. lol
[23:55:01] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Okay I'll tell my wife no remodel
[23:55:35] <JakeSays> the real fun doesn't start until you start designing your own stuff
[23:55:42] <_genuser_> JakeSays what you recommend on the learning syllabus for 3d printing? I'm looking videos of 3d printing hinges, moving parts, etc.
[23:56:11] <JakeSays> _genuser_: i dunno. i just bought a printer and jumped in.
[23:56:19] <MatthiasVance> Same
[23:56:22] <JakeSays> pretty much how i do everything. lol
[23:56:37] <JakeSays> it usually works out well, but not a suggested path for relationships
[23:57:47] <_genuser_> JakeSays well you said: "you need to attend 3d printer school, dammit"
[23:58:01] <JakeSays> i did
[23:58:10] <_genuser_> JakeSays but I'm thinking of following the same dev path: buy the thing, start playing wiht it.
[23:58:19] <MatthiasVance> Here's 3D printer school _genuser_: Buy a cheap printer, swear a lot, have a lot of fun
[23:58:20] <JakeSays> that's the school. lol
[23:58:30] <_genuser_> ah, I see what you did there.
[23:58:37] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[23:59:13] <_genuser_> not sure what I might build that I actually need to have built right now. But I wonder if I might build small items like container boxes, etc. for small electronic parts.
