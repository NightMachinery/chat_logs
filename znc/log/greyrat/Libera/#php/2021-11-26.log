[00:21:24] <ThePhilgrim> Debug should be changed to 0 later
[00:29:38] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, I get some bugs https://dpaste.com/6E9EM8DBT
[00:30:50] <ordos> ThePhilgrim, code looks fine enough, definitely validate the email address though, and typically PHPMailer you use a try / catch block for the send() function
[00:32:08] <ordos> You mentioned earlier today you're fairly new to all this so I'd recommend you read up on Exception handling - https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php - and also how to validate email addresses -  https://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.examples.validation.php
[00:32:20] <ThePhilgrim> ordos: Okay, try/catch instead of the if !$mail... ?
[00:33:05] <ordos> ThePhilgrim, yes. PHPMailer uses Exceptions
[00:33:35] <ordos> Those above links are recommended reading; it'll improve your coding skills
[00:42:29] <__adrian> "recommend you read up on Exception handling" // actually i'd recommend building the habit of _throwing_ exceptions. in many, many cases, you should NOT handle (catch) exceptions (beyond properly configuring your error reporting/logging settings).
[00:42:58] <__adrian> you try..catch ONLY where you expect a specific exception, AND know what to do to fix it.
[00:43:07] <__adrian> logging/error page ≠ fix
[00:43:21] <__adrian> if you don't have a fix, you don't try..catch.

[01:04:14] <ordos>  You're splitting hairs man. Building the habit of throwing exceptions requires reading up on exceptions. And PHPMailer is a great case for using try/catch. Hell, it's right in the first example on its Github page. Not saying you must use try/catch for everything. But in this case it's warranted.

[01:06:11] <__adrian>  it's a meaningful and useful point. no, i'm not saying you shouldn't know how exceptions and try..catch work. i'm cautioning against a very common antipattern of using try..catch *everywhere* an exception may be thrown. in the vast majority of cases, you shouldn't.
[01:06:32] <ordos> We're on the same page about that
[01:06:55] <forgotmynick> i've set opcache to 4GB, opcache reveals it's using all of it but in linux top i can't see this number any where. where would this data be shown?
[01:07:56] *** Joins: Icedream (~icedream@144.76.223.175)
[01:07:59] <__adrian> i'd also caution against "it's in the example" logic - examples are, by nature, contrived situations that show you some behavior, and usually not intended for copy+paste usage.
[01:08:55] <__adrian> the tutorial i linked earlier shows  catch (Exception $e) { echo $e->errorMessage(); }  which might be useful for helping the dev understand what's happening, but is definitely not something you should do in production code.
[01:09:41] <__adrian> (sorry, i honestly don't mean to sound like i'm harping :)
[01:09:57] <ordos> No it's all good, I understand where you're coming from
[01:10:48] <ordos> It's wise to caution against misuse of exceptions. I've seen lots of poor code where exceptions are used to control flow
[01:11:10] <ThePhilgrim> ordos: Would you say I need to validate emails in my php code too? The html validation is not good enough?
[01:11:24] <ordos> I'm just referring back to that users questions from earlier. Got the impression they were very new to PHP. Kinda need to start with the basics before learning all the nuances of where and where not to use exceptions
[01:11:44] <ThePhilgrim> ordos: I started today with PHP xD
[01:12:09] <__adrian> i'll still disagree there. learn not catching. then later, as you need to, learn the nuances of wehn you _should_.
[01:12:40] <__adrian> "ThePhilgrim> The html validation is not good enough?"  html/js validation is _completely irrelevant_.
[01:12:50] <ordos> ThePhilgrim, personally I'd suggest you always validate on the server. Can't trust the client
[01:12:57] <__adrian> it's for user convenience, so you can help them submit good inputs.
[01:13:26] <__adrian> i don't have to follow your html/js validation. i don't have to use your form/webpage at all, in fact.
[01:13:29] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, okay! I remember reading that too actually! "Never trust the client"
[01:13:40] <__adrian> yep. always validate your inputs  :)
[01:13:48] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, will keep that in mind
[01:13:56] <__adrian> k, i gotta run. have fun
[01:14:23] <ordos> Cheers
[01:14:44] <ThePhilgrim> noord is helping me with the PHPMailer script. I'll see if we can validate the stuff. Atm we're using "htmlspecialchars()", that also helps I guess
[01:18:51] <__adrian> that's for output. it's got nothing to do with validation.

[15:32:41] <ThePhilgrim> Hey guys! Noord helped me a lot yesterday with my PHPMailer file. Somebody told me yesterday about data validation (Tino-Didriksen(?)) . If my fetch API sends the data to a PHP file in the public dir, and that file sends the data to my PHPMailer file which is located outside the public dir. Would it make sense for me to validate name/email etc in both PHP files or just in one?

[16:32:07] <Naktibalda> relipse: yes it is quite popular, though recently I usually see them named clientId/clientSecret rather than username/password, the meaning is the same though.
[16:33:10] <relipse> so if I am developing an API, should I like fore people to register for a token?
[16:33:18] <relipse> force~
[16:33:26] <relipse> like an application token
[16:33:51] <Naktibalda> as opposed to making it completely public?
[16:34:19] <relipse> as opposed to letting them "login" to get a token that expires quickly

[17:01:30] <Blondie101010> from what I got, they want to allow their users to authenticate through a local app
[17:01:43] <ThePhilgrim> Blondie101010: Thanks! It does work when adding /
[17:01:52] <Blondie101010> either arrange the auth directly in the app, or set up proper API keys
[17:01:54] <ThePhilgrim> I'm horribly confused by absolute/relative paths etc
[17:02:22] <Blondie101010> ThePhilgrim:  well that's basic operating system / file system usage
[17:04:31] <Blondie101010> ThePhilgrim:  do you know what '..' refers to?
[17:05:30] <Koopz> is the example on Attributes in the php docs just stupid or am i stupid?
[17:05:34] <relipse> __DIR__ always needs a / right after it
[17:06:02] <noord> Blondie101010: if my understanding correct, relipse wants an api that feeds different kind of frontend clients such as mobile and web apps
[17:06:20] <relipse> exactly noord thank you
[17:06:23] <Blondie101010> yes, so to be practical, each app should have an API key
[17:06:37] <relipse> and they "register" their app
[17:06:41] <Blondie101010> yes
[17:06:42] <relipse> and get an api key
[17:06:52] <relipse> does that require a secret as well?
[17:06:58] <Blondie101010> not a temporary token, so make it very secure
[17:07:05] <Blondie101010> I said "proper"
[17:07:25] <relipse> ok so no temporary tokens
[17:07:33] <Blondie101010> so yes you need to do it well like a private/public key challenge
[17:07:39] <pmercado> Hi, is there a way to got an unique identification for every request? I mean... I'm logging into a single file in debug mode and want to catch a request and distinguish among other requests while "tail -f" the file
[17:08:02] <pmercado> is it possible? current config is nginx + php 7.2 + laravel + mysql
[17:10:11] <Blondie101010> pmercado:  if you mean to have it in the URL, you could possibly just add a random GET parameter
[17:10:15] <noord> pmercado: yes it is possibly
[17:10:27] <noord> possible*
[17:10:43] <noord> nginx or laravel can add correlation id to request

[20:34:17] <AllenJB> $mail doesn't exist in that scope - it only exists inside the get_smtp_client() function. You want $smtp_client->Debugoutput (if the line is unmoved)

[20:36:40] <guy_frm_yogaland> AllenJB: I am new to unit testing and I can't figure out what a unit actually is supposed to be? is it a method or a class or an interface?
[20:37:24] <AllenJB> ThePhilgrim: You generally shouldn't need to override / explicitly specify ->Debugoutput.
[20:38:06] <ThePhilgrim> I didn't have it in the code before.. but since it's not working, I read that you should be able to get some hints from it

[20:38:29] <AllenJB> ThePhilgrim: I note you appear to be taking the debug level value from a JSON config file, but the PHPMailer documentation uses a constant. Have you checked you're using the right value? (I would not take it from the config file while debugging)

[21:22:46] <skyroveRR> db.php contains constants for accessing the sqlite database using pdo and html.php contains functions for sending proper headers and HTML text based on input processed. The issue is this: When I attempt to open dig.php, I get this error: https://termbin.com/glwa .

[21:32:06] *** Quits: luigibu (~luigi@80.30.201.209) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:32:07] <da_wunder> with that -v you get that information with nc
[21:32:22] <ThePhilgrim> Sorry, is smtp server and port sensitive or can I share it here?
[21:32:43] <ThePhilgrim> I guess the smtp url itself is not sensitive info? :S
[21:33:30] <biberu> we can't know that, but I don't see why you need to share it?
[21:33:52] <ThePhilgrim> Connection to smtp.hostinger.com port 465 [tcp/urd] succeeded! <---
[21:34:12] <biberu> and this is from the same machine as your script?
[21:34:15] <ThePhilgrim> y
[21:34:24] <ThePhilgrim> even cd'd to same folder if that matters
[21:34:40] <biberu> that's one step forward, you should be able to reach it from php too
[21:35:03] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, so I try now to add in smtp hostname, port, username and password again
[21:35:31] <da_wunder> even I can connect to that with nc - so the problem is not there
[21:36:40] <ThePhilgrim> Nope.. stuck on pending again ..
[21:36:51] <da_wunder> maybe ssl related problem
[21:36:59] <biberu> see if phpmailer has some timeout you can set
[21:37:02] <ThePhilgrim> And can't ctrl + C in PHP localserver

[21:48:58] <Byteflux> Sounds like maybe you're attempting to use your host's SMTP server from outside of their network? You could always test sending raw SMTP commands with netcat
[21:49:07] <Byteflux> `nc -vC smtp.hostinger.com 465`
[21:49:14] <Byteflux> I get no response back when I send a `HELO` command.

[21:49:34] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: not at a computer so can't test, but another useful trick for debugging issues like this is to send the traffic through a proxy that can dump it to your console or a file, that'll let you see what phpmailer is doing behind the scenes
[21:50:26] <biberu> does the server answer with anything at all?
[21:51:18] <biberu> it should tell you that it's ready right after you connect
[21:51:18] *** Joins: deksar (~deksar@user/deksar)
[21:51:42] <Byteflux> Nope, no response upon connect, no response to HELO. Maybe it requires TLS, though. In which case, nc or telnet wouldn't be able to test that.
[21:53:07] <biberu> curl?
[21:54:34] <Byteflux> That could be another thing to try, don't know the command but surely it would support TLS.
[21:55:16] <Byteflux> https://stackoverflow.com/a/16069786
[21:55:25] <Byteflux> Seems you could adapt that as a starting point.
[21:56:00] <biberu> you could also try to tell phpmailer to use tls
[21:56:17] <biberu> i guess there's an option for that?
[21:56:18] <Byteflux> Oh, yeah that goes without saying. Looks like port 465 should *imply* TLS
[21:56:38] <Byteflux> Not sure if the configuration being supplied would allow it to automatically use TLS
[21:57:14] <biberu> no idea
[21:59:06] *** Joins: guenhael (~Thunderbi@aaubervilliers-652-1-290-168.w82-121.abo.wanadoo.fr)
[22:00:04] <Byteflux> Looks like maybe `SMTPSecure` property needs to be set to 'tls' on `$mail` in `get_smtp_client()`
[22:02:45] <Byteflux> Or actually, set it to PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS which is explicitly for port 465, assuming PHPMailer isn't doing that automatically based on the port configuration.
[22:04:24] <Byteflux> https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/src/PHPMailer.php#L52 -- (or the string 'ssl', the string 'tls' is for STARTLS which is typically on port 587)

[22:16:07] <ThePhilgrim> I'm trying to follow what you guys have been writing, but I'm not exactly sure I can. But if I am not mistaken, when I changed to the hostinger credentials the first time, it worked. I got a resonse 200 even though I didn't get an email
[22:17:40] *** Quits: aporetical (~mj@88.98.217.239) (Quit: Connection closed)
[22:18:13] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: the theory is that phpmailer is stuck because it's not initializing a secure connection properly, and you could try to configure it to do so explicitly and see if anything changes
[22:19:34] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: you can still also use other tools to test it out, you should be able to run an smtp session manually, once you know how, you also know what settings phpmailer needs (but not if it supports them or how to configure it)
[22:21:49] <ThePhilgrim> Uhm. Okay, a secure connection would be SSL?

[22:35:42] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: also, there's a lot of things to learn, especially in the beginning, eventually patterns will emerge, you'll have less to figure out at once, but would expect to keep learning for a long, long time

[23:19:49] <biberu> it's not always easy
[23:21:09] <ThePhilgrim> For me it's often like finding a needle in a haystack. I know the information I'm looking for is in there somewhere, but I can't filter the useful info from what is not relevant to me
[23:23:55] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: when did you start coding?
[23:24:07] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:25:56] <ThePhilgrim> I started last january with some Python, and then a little bit of html/css. then I stopped in May because of lack of time, then I started with Javascript around 3 weeks ago, and PHP two days ago :D
[23:26:38] <biberu> cut yourself some slack
[23:27:33] <ThePhilgrim> I have done two Python programs that I'm pretty proud of. One webscraper that notifies me about new jobs on Upwork (freelance site) https://github.com/ThePhilgrim/Upwatch , and also one that takes the most common phrases in English and machine translates them to a chosen language (https://github.com/ThePhilgrim/N-Trans)
[23:27:46] <ThePhilgrim> I work as a translator, so I've tried to build some stuff that helps my workflow
[23:28:12] <ThePhilgrim> But now I haven't tinkered with Python for so long, so I have the feeling that I'd need some time to remember the syntax
