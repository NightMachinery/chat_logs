[00:08:00] <MoonBounce> so
[00:08:11] <MoonBounce> why does MDT have so many issues with hyper-v
[00:08:13] <MoonBounce> for me
[00:08:26] <MoonBounce> im guessing its because when you try to view the screen its technically rdp
[00:09:36] <nobyk> definitely smells like RDP yeah
[00:09:47] <nobyk> the vm-connect.exe thing that is
[00:10:35] *** tg_ is now known as tg
[00:10:44] <MoonBounce> yeah cause its totally fine with vmware workstation
[00:10:50] <MoonBounce> its just super funky with hyper-v

[01:53:55] <rpifan> well this is supposed to be germany
[01:54:06] <rpifan> 5 minutes without any information should not be acceptable
[01:54:28] <rpifan> anyway i told the recruiter dude they should at least send an email if the were having techincal issues, and i hung up on the recruiter dude

[11:41:09] <Hunterkll> a lot don't have service anymore
[11:41:14] <Hunterkll> especially if they're AT&T or Verizon marked
[11:41:29] <Hunterkll> means they just got disconnected remotely and abandoned instead of being sold off to the payphone operator companies
[11:41:40] <Hunterkll> but you can steal it and take it home at that point 
[11:41:41] <Activ8> Disgraceful 
[11:41:43] <Hunterkll> and use it as your desk phone

[11:42:28] <Hunterkll> yea verizon got out of the payphone business in 2011

[17:54:40] <Telgareith> i'm on 500/500 and its more than ample
[17:54:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm on 500/500 here and its plenty
[17:55:00] * PattyCakes cries in docsis land
[17:55:05] <sintax> lol
[17:55:06] <PattyCakes> I mean I can't cry too hard, I still have gig down
[17:55:07] <Telgareith> lol
[17:55:17] <vinrock> i just had comcast metro ethernet installed at one of my sites
[17:55:20] <vinrock> ordered 500/50
[17:55:21] <vinrock> er
[17:55:22] <sintax> I'm gonna see if i can saturate it
[17:55:29] <vinrock> 500/500 and im getting 650/500
[17:55:33] <sintax> ooh nice
[17:55:35] <PattyCakes> and honestly, the upload side is more than enough - I get about 50mbps up
[17:55:38] <PattyCakes> but 1.3gbps down
[17:55:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> I've been thinking of getting a secondary connection though
[17:55:40] * thegodsquirrel wishes for fiber
[17:55:42] <PattyCakes> 1.2*
[17:55:48] <vinrock> dayum
[17:55:49] <sintax> ftth the home has been life changing. 
[17:55:52] <Telgareith> I'm on fiber
[17:55:56] <Telgareith> honestly
[17:55:58] <vinrock> at this office we have 980 up/down
[17:55:59] <Telgareith> fttp is enough
[17:56:03] <sintax> so stable and running my own equipment. 
[17:56:04] <vinrock> fios biz
[17:56:07] <Telgareith> vinrock: fios?
[17:56:08] <Telgareith> yea
[17:56:11] <Telgareith> that's what I'd have
[17:56:12] <PattyCakes> sintax, must be nice in your fancy new house
[17:56:22] <sintax> my house is 15 ish years old
[17:56:22] <Telgareith> fios isn't just new houses
[17:56:31] <sintax> the reason it's so easy is my utilities are above ground :)
[17:56:35] <vinrock> i was one of the first customers in the country to get fios, i had it the week it rolled out
[17:56:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> my house is 6 years old
[17:56:39] <Telgareith> both my properties with fios are 30+
[17:56:42] <thegodsquirrel> Considered Ethernet over Coax 
[17:56:47] <sintax> i'm hoping the drop a 10gbps sfp+ on the ont and i can just change mine all over to 10gbps nic's
[17:56:48] <Telgareith> vinrock: same
[17:56:54] <thegodsquirrel> Then I could get Fios 
[17:57:10] <PublicWiFi> automation is insanely fun
[17:57:14] <sintax> then have the capability of 10gbps but be limited to 2gbps but the rest of my network and backbone be 10gbps
[17:57:18] <sintax> PublicWiFi: i agree
[17:57:20] <PublicWiFi> but fuck if your "truth" is off about data its fucked
[17:57:45] <PublicWiFi> turning a 16 hours human job into a automated process is annoying because people can't help me layout strict rules about the data lol
[17:57:48] <Telgareith> you mean your state? Wifi
[17:57:54] <Telgareith> oh
[17:57:56] <Telgareith> yea
[17:58:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> PublicWiFi yeah thats tough
[17:58:22] <estranger> data!
[17:58:29] <sintax> do what you want and tell them their lack of help has no rendered this monster and that's what they get. 
[17:58:32] <PublicWiFi> I got something to give me a "truth table" yesterday, but turnsout she uses her discretion on some data points lol
[17:58:37] <sintax> they don't like it they should have participated. 
[17:58:41] <PattyCakes> sintax - while I 100% support the absurdity of that setup, have you stopped to think about the "why" of it?
[17:58:45] <PublicWiFi> so im having to send this table back for the 3rd time and say FIGURE OUT SOME RULES PLS
[17:58:47] <PattyCakes> I mean is 10gbps really worth the cost?
[17:59:09] <PublicWiFi> 10gbps pls thank
[17:59:12] <AnonymooseReddtr> depends what you are ding it
[17:59:12] <sintax> PattyCakes: it's really not that terrible. Especially when the FREE hand me downs came with dual 10gbps nics and a 10gbps dell core switch
[17:59:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> doing with it
[17:59:23] <PattyCakes> carry on good sir, carry on :P
[17:59:33] <AnonymooseReddtr> i had 1gbe at the old job because we were offsiting a lot of data backups
[17:59:42] <sintax> PattyCakes: :) for sure. I wouldn't do a 10gbps home network if that was the case and I had to purchase everything. 
[17:59:59] <sintax> the only thing i've purchased is a UDM-Pro and a QNAP multigigabit switch. 
[18:00:01] <PattyCakes> yea, we're not talking about work AnonymooseReddtr - I can justify whatever the hell I want for work
[18:00:09] <PattyCakes> it's that home network I'm having a hard time justifying
[18:00:10] <sintax> networking is my weak spot so this will help immensely. 
[18:00:12] <PattyCakes> but free is free
[18:00:17] <vinrock> i just got a udm pro
[18:00:19] <Telgareith> I had to buy some stuff
[18:00:22] <sintax> vinrock: you like it?
[18:00:27] <vinrock> its pretty neat
[18:00:29] <sintax> for sure
[18:00:30] <PublicWiFi> so far I could implement the parts I have done and cut the job in half
[18:00:38] <PublicWiFi> i love it so much
[18:00:38] <vinrock> i got it for the new company we opened in buffalo so i can have them as hands-off as possible
[18:00:42] <vinrock> just get them som ebasic security n shit
[18:00:52] <PublicWiFi> if OCR tech was a lot better I could probably automate out data entry staff out of jobs :S
[18:00:58] <sintax> vinrock: i'm going to get cameras for mine and also the video doorbell from ubiquiti
[18:01:04] <PattyCakes> dude I'm still rocking an edgerouter PoE from 2011
[18:01:06] <vinrock> yeah for home this thing is perfect

[18:01:09] <Telgareith> PublicWiFi: OCR is good, just good OCR is expensive
[18:01:13] <PublicWiFi> ^
[18:01:14] <PattyCakes> and it has been the most solid piece of networking gear I have ever owned
[18:01:15] <PublicWiFi> this
[18:01:32] <PublicWiFi> we are in medical though so accuracy is more important than quantity ofdata entered
[18:01:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> video doorbell
[18:01:40] <sintax> PattyCakes: for sure. Ubuquiti has one in early access I want but it's a mutligigabit router/switch
[18:02:00] <vinrock> would it be faster to just ocr and review instead of transcribing eveything
[18:02:06] <sintax> AnonymooseReddtr: yes. video doorbell. one that i can block from sending traffic outside of network to god knows who
[18:02:10] *** Joins: tapo (~textual@209.6.227.123)

[18:02:30] <PattyCakes> meh, I got over that paranoia sintax 
[18:02:31] <PattyCakes> so what if amazon wants to see my front porch

[18:02:40] <sintax> tapo: being nerds
[18:02:48] <tapo> estranger im back in irc woo
[18:02:48] <sintax> PattyCakes: i just want the control is all
[18:02:56] <rpifan> PCR is good enoguh
[18:03:02] <PattyCakes> now my actual security cameras, well those are standard IP Cams
[18:03:06] <PattyCakes> ain't no way Id let ring INSIDE my house
[18:03:20] <sintax> no doubt
[18:03:26] <estranger> tapo, woooo
[18:03:28] <vinrock> i dont want anyone accesing cameras even at my front door
[18:03:28] <sintax> bad enough my samsung tv listens to me lol
[18:03:30] <estranger> youve been a busy dude
[18:03:31] <vinrock> i aint helping THE MAN
[18:03:38] <estranger> "declined declined declined"
[18:03:39] <sintax> vinrock the anarchist
[18:03:44] <PattyCakes> nobody cares about your front porch vinrock 
[18:03:52] <vinrock> pattycakes not per se
[18:03:55] <tapo> well also my laptop died
[18:04:00] <vinrock> i dont want to participate in mass surveilence
[18:04:04] <estranger> oh damn
[18:04:06] <PattyCakes> I have the ring doorbell and a floodlight cam simply as backups to my actual system
[18:04:07] <tapo> and I've spent the past month rebuilding all my dotfiles
[18:04:15] <estranger> thats still no excuse for declining everything :P
[18:04:21] <tapo> lmao
[18:04:26] <estranger> coworker has been rocking it though
[18:04:36] <tapo> I'll be in the next one I swear :)
[18:04:44] <sintax> what are you getting in
[18:04:46] <tapo> ya hes a good guy
[18:04:59] <tapo> sintax kafka meetings broooo
[18:05:05] <sintax> kafka?
[18:05:08] <estranger> im about to send out an email saying i need to cancel tomorrow :X i got a family issue going on, gotta go help my BIL family.. hes having random surgery tomorrow unexpectedly 
[18:05:19] <sintax> dang
[18:05:21] <vinrock> hope hes ok
[18:05:23] <sintax> that's never fun estranger 
[18:05:24] <tapo> godspeed
[18:05:31] <estranger> he should be ok but the fucker got MRSA on top of it
[18:05:46] <Oliber> i looked at the Eufy doorbell and cameras, you need to store the recordings else where (because an SD card on the device isn't really great), and the doorbell looks like it can easily be pulled off or otherwise removed; the ring stuff is currently more sensible
[18:05:47] <estranger> found clots and an anyerisym in his leg
[18:05:48] <tapo> also I thought by random surgery they'd just admit him then roll a die and perform a literal random surgery
[18:05:48] <vinrock> yikes
[18:06:02] <estranger> 2D20 surgical knife damage
[18:06:13] <Oliber> but it does piss me off that the ring chime pro will ONLY extend range to other ring devices, not a general purpose wifi extender
[18:06:23] <estranger> Oliber, yeah its dumb
[18:06:27] <tapo> guess whos getting a 3rd arm grafted on
[18:06:30] <PattyCakes> Oliber, if someone is close enough to rip your door bell off the wall
[18:06:31] <PattyCakes> you've already lost
[18:06:34] <estranger> tapo, lol
[18:06:37] <sintax> Oliber: i hear ya
[18:06:46] <estranger> tapo, but did the prometheus stuff go ok yesterday if you got to it?
[18:06:58] <sintax> hey you two
[18:07:00] <Oliber> PattyCakes: my door bell is under 6ft from the sidewalk

[18:23:05] <fritzwastaken> https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2525047
[18:23:06] <PublicWiFi> wait my idea involves elections and stuff to help you randomize the board and make the hex turn whatver color and disaply a number too lol
[18:23:18] <PublicWiFi> electronics*
[18:23:22] <fritzwastaken> magnetic multicolored peices
[18:23:29] <PublicWiFi> okay thats sick
[18:23:43] <PublicWiFi> wonder how thich these are
[18:23:50] <PublicWiFi> I could just remix this to my idea lol
[18:23:58] <sintax> do it
[18:24:05] <PublicWiFi> they thin rip
[18:24:10] <fritzwastaken> nope
[18:24:13] <fritzwastaken> they thicc
[18:24:13] <PublicWiFi> gotta extend the base a bit to hid the electronics
[18:24:25] <fritzwastaken> like 3 quarters stacked on top of each other
[18:24:34] <PublicWiFi> i already had it all planned out but then I started to design a nice hex and I suck so I stopped
[18:24:36] <fritzwastaken> definitely bigger than the original cardboard slices
[18:24:48] <PublicWiFi> gonna use i2c to help the pieces sync up and communicate 
[18:25:09] <PublicWiFi> the magnets power each one etc etc... okay i gotta stfu now
[18:25:19] <sintax> lol
[18:25:28] <sintax> i need brightfin to figure their shit out.

[18:28:50] <sintax> they're old though. 
[18:29:00] <JollyRgrs> they are garbo, keep freezing up, a lot of apps don't support it anymore (twitch anyone?)
[18:29:09] <JollyRgrs> this is even newer like roku 4 ultra
[18:29:10] <fritzwastaken> my old roku bricked because it was so old
[18:29:26] <sintax> yeah i'm afraid this new update is gonna take them out
[18:29:48] <fritzwastaken> I had to buy new ones because of copyright protection
[18:29:51] <sintax> or annoy me as they're saying it's one of their bigger growth engines to add advertising
[18:31:08] <cryptic1> why not just get a firetv or whatever instead
[18:31:24] <cryptic1> at least you can side load android apps on it
[18:31:36] <JollyRgrs> fireTV is ... "not fire"
[18:31:39] <fritzwastaken> Huzzah!
[18:31:41] <fritzwastaken> Thanks for applying for our Systems Administrator position. I've reviewed your resume and would like to schedule an intro call this week (Sept 21st-24th). We'll keep this first call to 30 minutes or less. Please respond with some time ranges that would work well for you. Looking forward to speaking with you!
[18:31:48] <JollyRgrs> i really like the new chromecast with google TV right now

[18:32:06] <fritzwastaken> i was drunk at the time and didnt want to respond
[18:32:09] <fritzwastaken> im just excited

[18:32:13] <PublicWiFi> fritzwastaken: dont worry, i've had 2 denial emails this week :(
[18:32:15] <sintax> JollyRgrs: have you played with and nvidia shield
[18:32:25] <sintax> fritzwastaken: good luck
[18:32:28] <PublicWiFi> fritzwastaken: oh that was good news, that's dope
[18:32:53] <JollyRgrs> sintax: no, i really like the idea of it.... but 2 things.... 1) price 2) HW wasn't refreshed for so long, so when it was like 3-4 yrs old, i didn't want to bite and go for it
[18:33:35] <sintax> JollyRgrs: i've got one and use it instead of the smart tv features. But when they do a new one i'll probably grab one as long as the insides are refreshed and decent. 
[18:33:44] <sintax> plays everything i've thrown at it. 
[18:33:59] <JollyRgrs> yeah, that's what i like about it. i def. don't use any "smart TV" features
[18:34:06] <PublicWiFi> fuck a smart tv
[18:34:19] <JollyRgrs> in fact, i hate that the LG menu keeps popping up on the TV when I switch inputs on the receiver (TV doesn't ever change input)
[18:34:21] <PublicWiFi> connect your tv to wifi via fire stick or roku
[18:34:24] <JollyRgrs> I want to disable that
[18:34:43] <sintax> My LG only ever complains it has an update
[18:34:55] <vinrock> will a pihole stop yt ads on smart tvs
[18:35:02] <vinrock> my yt app is ucking nonstop ads now
[18:35:09] <sintax> No, I dont' think so
[18:35:11] <vinrock> ugh
[18:35:28] <sintax> might get some but the way yt embeds them i read it's hard to block them from the video side 
[18:35:30] <sintax> i could be wrong. 
[18:35:31] <JollyRgrs> sintax: mine happens when i switch to certain inputs... like going to the Switch or Chromecast, it seems to pop up, so I had to set harmony to also hit the "back" button on the TV after a second or two
[18:35:46] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: just yet YT red :D
[18:35:59] <sintax> JollyRgrs: that's dumb. it should do anything. just switch. weird it's popping up.
[18:36:03] <JollyRgrs> I got it back when it was just google music
[18:36:11] <sintax> i may have never noticed because I don't change inputs that often
[18:36:12] <JollyRgrs> sintax: yeah... PITA

[20:24:53] <vinrock> i got into DiVe right after NailZ left aol
[20:25:01] <sintax> heh
[20:25:13] <sintax> when the internet wasn't 10 web pages and bull crap
[20:25:20] <sintax> memories.
[20:25:30] <vinrock> back when the microsoft website was just a bigass MICROSOFT logo and text links
[20:25:35] <sintax> Yup
[20:25:42] <sintax> what a fun time to be alive. 
[20:25:45] <zerocool> technonerd: 0.0.0.0 means any interface.
[20:25:50] <vinrock> yeah that was the golden era
[20:26:09] <vinrock> i always knew the web would devolve into what it is
[20:26:21] <vinrock> and i saw the writing on the wall with social media, thats why ive never once signed up for or used it
[20:26:39] <sintax> I still have fb. still banned on fb for like another 18 days. :/
[20:26:49] <sintax> Thinking of just downloading my photos and closing it out and being done. 
[20:26:51] <sintax> it hurts my head
[20:27:00] <vinrock> i never understood exposing my private life to the world
[20:27:08] <sintax> i mean there's that
[20:27:13] <vinrock> and i realized how it could lead to manipulating people
[20:27:33] <sintax> then there's lets do this for fun. First car? Concert? Address? SS# etc... things people do
[20:27:33] <vinrock> now it baically seems like there are two poeple in the world, people living in the real world and people living this odd intenret based reality
[20:27:52] <sintax> yup
[20:27:58] <sintax> of instagram models 
[20:28:00] <vinrock> hah yeah find out people's security qustions
[20:28:04] <sintax> this is what we created the internet for?
[20:28:16] <sintax> vinrock: yup haha and people do it willingly

[20:29:17] <sintax> random question
[20:29:42] <sintax> the ONT on the side of my house just converts the fiber line to rj45. There would still need to be an sfp+ module of some sort to convert right?

[20:32:35] <zerocool> im just anti these vaxx for now.
[20:32:44] <sintax> i'm just anti social

[20:33:52] <sintax> but seriously. burger and a salad for lunch?
[20:34:12] <zerocool> nice thing about a burger is you can dress it with a salad
[20:34:14] <vinrock> im in an essential industry

[20:34:25] <sintax> zerocool: lol
[20:34:26] <vinrock> pretty much nothing at all has changed for me all this time
[20:34:48] <sintax> vinrock: same. i'm either home, fishing, kayaking or hunting. 
[20:34:54] <sintax> pretty much on my own
[20:35:18] <sintax> and if you're within 6'6" you're gonna get smacked with a bait caster
[20:35:30] <vinrock> i need to get some fishing in

[20:35:46] <sintax> vinrock: i did

[20:35:57] <sintax> took some getting used to. but i'm really good with rat nests now
[20:36:03] <vinrock> hah
[20:36:08] <sintax> but there's a trick to it.

[20:37:48] <PublicWiFi> so whats teh fuckin point if they are both in the script
[20:38:33] <zerocool> PublicWiFi: you put the secrets in another file with permissions set read only to a specific user.
[20:38:38] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> you could just hash it. At least keep it outta plain text
[20:38:42] <sintax> can you use a security cert?

[20:39:18] <thegodsquirrel> iphone You are right, I misread that.
[20:39:22] <zerocool> depends on how it's used i guess.
[20:39:26] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> you can also set the pass to a env variable
[20:39:39] <iphone> PublicWiFi: you read environment variables, and store the variables in a local source script with tight permissions outside of version control

[20:42:04] <iphone> I prefer the term cloud indian
[20:42:14] <PublicWiFi> hmmm
[20:42:19] <PublicWiFi> yeah I can just store it in a seperate file I suppose
[20:42:31] <PublicWiFi> honestly the data is very sensitive I just like to do things the right way
[20:42:35] <PublicWiFi> isn't very**
[20:42:36] <zerocool> that is the simplest way and it is perfectly secure
[20:43:11] <iphone> that's how we manage secrets for things like ansible, we store it in 1password, and enter it manually on runtime, or we store it in a local file, but you should never hard code credentials anywhere
[20:43:20] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> don't check it into git obvs

[20:43:34] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> tfvars
[20:43:54] <iphone> and putting it in a separate file is as secure as encrypting it with a local key... that key is just a file after all
[20:43:55] <zerocool> yes add the secret file to .gitignore
[20:44:09] <zerocool> ^
[20:44:24] <PublicWiFi> I would just sotre the key in the file not the password
[20:44:28] <zerocool> iphone - you are not a zoomer are you.
[20:44:28] <PublicWiFi> so id have the hash + key
[20:44:37] <iphone> unless that key is AES encrypted :D
[20:44:50] <PublicWiFi> ENCRYPTCEPTION
[20:44:59] <iphone> zerocool: I'm not zoomer, not millenial. I'm on the generational fence.
[20:45:01] <PublicWiFi> THEN ILL ENCRYPT THE SCRIPT

[23:32:48] <iphone> they croak super loadly when you land them
[23:33:04] <iphone> s/load/loud
[23:33:04] <layer8> iphone meant: "they croak super loudly when you land them"
[23:34:45] <Activ8> Lol really?
[23:34:54] <Activ8> I haven’t had fish make a loud noise
[23:35:03] <iphone> catfish and searobins both make noise
[23:35:14] <iphone> at least the channel cats around here do
[23:35:16] <Activ8> we have catfish lakes here but I don’t fish them
[23:35:32] <iphone> its not as exciting as fishing with lures
[23:36:08] <Activ8> perch here go nuts for lures I can catch them on them on the lakes I fish with spinners 
[23:36:44] <iphone> I've never had any luck with spinners, but I struggle to find bank fishing spots here
[23:36:50] <iphone> fishing just sucks overall
[23:37:04] <Activ8> It’s good here especially in summer 
[23:37:28] <iphone> the lakes near my flood 25 feet each summer, just after spawn, so the fishing was really bad without a boat
[23:37:52] <iphone> all the fish are bedded up 50 feet away from the bank when it floods
[23:38:15] <Activ8> We don’t get floods too much here in lakes they are designed to cope 
[23:38:37] <vinrock> oh were fishing talkin again
[23:38:47] <iphone> the lakes here are reservoirs. they are massive. Lake norfork and bull shoals
[23:38:59] <vinrock> i gotta remember to bring tackle to my baltimore office, they're gonna take me fishing for snakehead down there
[23:39:03] <Activ8> We have reservoirs with big bream in them and big dog roach
[23:39:16] <vinrock> iphone the southernmost naturally spawning population of lake trout it right by me
[23:39:26] <Activ8> we have lots of trout here
[23:39:33] <vinrock> lake trout are huge
[23:39:35] <vinrock> like 40lbs
[23:39:47] <Activ8> Not here lol 
[23:39:59] <Activ8> they don’t go past 15lb in lakes
[23:40:01] <vinrock> we only have them here because of an experiment in the 70s
[23:40:05] <iphone> we have some of the best trout fisheries 30 minutes from me. But they are 100% from hatcheries, they are not native here lol. We put them in our tailwaters of our dams
[23:40:16] <vinrock> they brought them in from canada and wanted to study em, the reservoir is so deep and cold they managed to survive
[23:40:34] <vinrock> im not a big fan of trout fishing tho, that is the boring fishing i dont like
[23:40:47] <vinrock> theyre impossible to triger you just gotta be lucky they're hungry and they spook so easily

[23:42:02] <vinrock> i would shit talk people into wanting to fite then id tell them their personal info and spook them

[23:45:53] <sintax> 17 total
[23:45:58] <sintax> but most of the people work remote. 
[23:46:05] <sintax> so i could and then just tell them sorry you don't have a spot
[23:46:08] <vinrock> i started in a cube farm
[23:46:14] <sintax> first time in a cube.
[23:46:17] <vinrock> at least i never dealt with open floorplan
[23:46:18] <sintax> not a fan
[23:46:24] <vinrock> yeah its claustrophobic
[23:46:27] <sintax> i had an open floor plan at my msp
[23:46:37] <vinrock> there is no way i could work like that
[23:46:38] <sintax> i liked it because we were spread out enough it didn't interfere with anything.
[23:46:54] <sintax> I mean it was alright especially once I didn't have anyone behind me
[23:48:04] <sintax> but yeah. I'm not a cube fan. I honestly just need a roof to cut down on the glare from the ceiling lights. 
[23:48:43] <iphone> I would love to have an office job. I've been wfh for a few years and its kinda lonely and boring
[23:49:18] <sintax> I enjoy working from home. Office is ok to bullshit with people here and there. But i'd prefer to be at home

[23:41:02] <SleePy> Fiber at the office has been down for a hour.. Can't do work.. Nice to be on this side of it
[23:41:15] <vinrock> i kinda like when shit hits the fan
[23:41:21] <vinrock> its a fun test of yourself

[23:41:41] <thegodsquirrel> I don't miss those days.
[23:42:05] <thegodsquirrel> Had a car accident kill our fiber and coax backup pipe in one fell swoop
[23:42:28] <SleePy> Just nice for it to not be my issue..  Fiber goes down at the start of lunch?  Well I still get my lunch and don't have to deal with trying to figure out if its the router, isp, or whatever in between. 
[23:42:30] <vinrock> ive heard that many times over the years
[23:42:35] <thegodsquirrel> All the higher ups were in my ass and I was like ...
[23:43:28] <SleePy> We've had similar.  Semi truck slide on ice right through the utility pole with our power.  "BOOM!"  There goes power.  Nothing I can do besides shutdown equipment before batteries died.
[23:45:10] <vinrock> the fiber i just had run at my baltimore site had to go through a bigass lumber mill next door becuz its in the way from the dmarc
[23:45:15] <iphone> should have failed over to your secondary DC duh
[23:45:16] <vinrock> so i totally expect that to get severed at some point
[23:45:19] <vinrock> posibly soon who knows
[23:45:39] <SleePy> Poor truck driver sat there for 4 hours before the utility district let him out.  Took that long to isolate out all the power in the area and ensure it was safe.  He was basically in a faraday cage
[23:45:41] <vinrock> i just stuck a cradlepoint in there for when that inevitably happens
[23:46:19] <SleePy> Secondary DC?  Whats that?  I just test everything in prod
[23:47:28] <iphone> a secondary dc is when you've automated your job and you need more work to secure your position
[23:47:38] <SleePy> I work in ag.  We have fiber going between buildings at one of our locations.  Just strung up in trees.. Amazing in the 6 years I have worked here, it hasn't been cut yet :\

[23:54:50] <vinrock> ive heard of people doing this before but never met anyone whos witnessed it

[23:55:14] <sintax> sounds perfect
[23:55:45] <SleePy> Yea.. Should have seen the worker at the office/shed.  Need a new cat5 cable pulled?  Shipping workers who where not busy would help string it along, staple it up and job done.
[23:56:09] <sintax> mmm i love stapling ethernet
[23:56:12] <SleePy> Now I make electricians do it, so it complies with code..
[23:57:13] <SleePy> But still got that and the cables/fiber zipped tied to water lines/other pipes around buildings..
