[00:10:49] <da_wunder> TrippyJ: create example of your error to 3v4l.org site and share that
[00:11:58] <TrippyJ> Oh, I figured it out, I am sorry
[00:12:05] <TrippyJ> I was using function_exists()
[00:12:12] <TrippyJ> and I forgot the function name inside had to be a string
[00:13:12] <da_wunder> would help a lot if you just share that actual error with 3v4l.org example
[00:14:46] <TrippyJ> if (!function_exists(functionName)){ }  // this code is invalid, it has to be if (!function_exists('functionName')){ }

[00:16:37] <da_wunder> I'm assuming that you're not using any IDEs, because those would show you that error quite clearly
[00:19:30] <TrippyJ> I don't know if this error existed previously in PHP. Either I always used to quote functions inside functions, or the error didn't exist previously. Perhaps the functionality is just being deprecated? Likely to avoid confusion between constants? Curious that it still even works like that, tbh.
[00:19:43] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[00:20:22] <TrippyJ> Yeah I only use nanoXD  haha, or Notepad++ if I'm not in the CLI.
[00:21:27] <TrippyJ> I'm still using VIM, too. Not to program, but I opened it a few years ago and couldn't figure out how to close it. Suppose that counts as still using it.
[00:21:50] <da_wunder> I would really recommend you to try out some proper IDE, you should see errors like that out of the box
[00:22:43] <TrippyJ> What is best IDE you recommend? I mainly only do PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS and JS. I tried a few years ago and just settled for the color highlighting on Notepad++ because it worked with all the languages I needed nicely.
[00:22:57] <TrippyJ> If you got a particular recommendation, I don't care so much about price.
[00:23:11] <da_wunder> I would recommend PhpStorm
[00:23:25] <funhouse> im working with postal codes, for example, one ending in 4y0, is it possible to -1 and have it output 4x9 ?
[00:24:21] <da_wunder> TrippyJ: and for "I don't know if this error existed previously in PHP." - https://3v4l.org/gncMW - it has never worked as you expected
[00:25:02] <da_wunder> TrippyJ: most likely you just haven't notice that at all because you've suppressed error messages
[00:26:34] <funhouse> or i guess I have to break it up and just subtract from y if last digit == 0?
[00:26:58] <__adrian> TrippyJ: it's not invalid code, but the error (an undefined const) has always existed. as da_wunder says, fix your error reporting configration
[00:26:59] <da_wunder> TrippyJ: oh that was actually working with php < 7.4 - https://3v4l.org/X1faQ
[00:27:21] <__adrian> it wasn't fatal, but it certainly didn't "work."
[00:27:47] <da_wunder> funhouse: some regex could work there
[00:28:26] <Albright> funhouse: I'd create a new class which stored the letter parts as integers internally and maybe had a decrement() method to properly do the math.

[00:32:40] <funhouse> the postal code is V7L4Y1
[00:32:49] <Albright> Canada, right?
[00:32:56] <funhouse> yup
[00:33:09] <da_wunder> isn't there some service to validate those in your country?
[00:33:16] <funhouse> im going to do a function i guess, well i dont need to validate
[00:33:22] <funhouse> i need to increment or decrement
[00:33:22] <__adrian> why are you "-1 and have it output 4x9"  ?
[00:33:34] <Albright> 4y0 - 1 = 4x9
[00:33:35] <__adrian> inc/dec doesn't make a ton of sense for postal codes
[00:33:46] <funhouse> basically im going thru a list, if i max out, i need to move to a neghboring one
[00:34:01] <funhouse> which is the next digit before or after
[00:34:02] <__adrian> Albright: maybe for that particular postal code system
[00:34:22] <__adrian> US postal codes sure as sugar don't work that way

[00:34:44] <Albright> Yeah, this is Canada as mentioned above
[00:34:46] <da_wunder> and if both are found? which one you choose? before or after one?
[00:34:58] <Albright> Both?
[00:35:00] <funhouse> da_wunder whatever one isnt maxed out

[00:36:33] <da_wunder> for what reason
[00:36:37] <Albright> It seems pretty simple to me.
[00:37:04] <__adrian> TrippyJ: it's still an error, you're just not seeing it
[00:37:05] <Albright> Is the reason relevant?
[00:37:07] <__adrian> !+error reporting
[00:37:07] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.
[00:37:09] <TrippyJ> For U.S. zip codes, I actually wrote a tool to scrape a third party
[00:37:38] <TrippyJ> __adrian: I actually think I just used to type the internal function names as strings, it is the only thing that makes sense. I'm in my error file 24/7

[00:40:24] <__adrian> the former seems more likely to be what you're talking about, but waaayyyyy less likely to be true in reality
[00:40:30] <TrippyJ> I know in the United States the zip code system is all kinds of whacked out. TBH, I wait for user to enter a zip, check my DB, if not there, scrape third party and add city/state/county/etc. data (so I don't abuse ToS too much by scraping, ethical scraping).This might not help you, by finding a third party where you might be able to find relevant
[00:40:31] <TrippyJ> information might help.
[00:40:38] <funhouse> __adrian both i suppose since postals are neghboring for the most part i belive
[00:40:57] <TrippyJ> I don't know about Canada, but U.S. postal codes, if you just tried to increment to find neighboring areas, you'd get a ton of zip codes that don't even exist.
[00:41:04] <funhouse> i scraped the shit out of canada post's postal look up
[00:41:06] <__adrian> doesn't seem plausible  :)  but i'll leave you to it

[00:44:24] <TrippyJ> Even in an ideal situation, you'd need all the Canadian zip codes and a way to group them by proximity, which I think is the real challenge. Unless a library already exists out there like that.
[00:44:40] <TrippyJ> If you're grouping them by proximity, when one overflows, just go to the next in your array or whatever
[00:44:49] <funhouse> have a db of shapes used with postgis
[00:45:40] <TrippyJ> Hmm, so you already have the grouping - but perhaps the grouping doesn't indicate well enough the actual proximity? I guess I was confused by your original question because of your word "stats"
[00:45:52] * __adrian shrugs
[00:45:53] <__adrian> you're still thinking in straight lines

[01:46:48] <Sammitch> anyway, canadian POSTAL codes are generally adjacent. eg: A0A 0A0 will likely be in the same immediate area as A0A 0A1
[01:47:16] <Sammitch> though there's no guarantee that that "adjacent" code is actually assigned
[01:54:20] <Blondie101010> gonogo:  which was my main expectations...  if you can't cause the problem when you simplify it, it means that what you remove to test it is where the issue is

[03:35:09] <Sammitch> __adrian: well also the codes work more or less like zip codes with each 'digit' being a subdivision of the preceding digit's area
[03:39:18] <Sammitch> eg: T5X 1A1 -> T=Alberta, 5=North Edmonton, X=Neighbourhood and then the allocation of 1A1 would vary based on the district, but is generally one or two codes per street
[03:51:34] <Albright> My state allocates license plate numbers by county. The second character is the first letter of the county, and the first character is a digit corresponding to where that county's name would be if all the counties starting with that letter were sorted in alphabetical order.
[03:52:13] <Albright> So Adams county plates start with 1A, Adams 2A.
[03:52:40] <Albright> Camas 1C, Canyon 2C, Caribou 3C, etc.
[03:53:33] <Albright> *Ada county is 1A

[07:38:41] <inscw00table> I'm trying to browse into a zstandard compressed tar without extracting it.
[07:40:01] <inscw00table> PharData doesn't recognize zstandard, and doesn't seem to work if I point it at a stream to the compressed data.
[07:40:24] <Rockwood> is it JS based thing?
[07:41:11] <inscw00table> I'm trying to do this in php.
[07:43:29] <inscw00table> The ancient Archive_Tar supports a stream, but only seems to recognize the ustar format, with most of the limitations of the v7 format.
[07:43:48] <__adrian> maybe https://github.com/kjdev/php-ext-zstd
[07:43:52] <__adrian> no idea if it's any good
[07:44:30] <inscw00table> Yeah, that's the lib I'm using to get zstd supported.
[07:44:48] <__adrian> is something not working well?
[07:45:31] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi sir
[07:45:46] <inscw00table> Well, it is recognized as a compression stream format... but I am having more trouble than I expected finding php that can operate on a /stream/ with recent tar formats.
[07:47:03] <__adrian> not sure what you mean by "php that can operate on ..."  do you mean this lib _doesn't_?
[07:47:31] <inscw00table> That library lets php understand the compression format.
[07:47:50] <inscw00table> I can decompress the file fine when I use it.
[07:48:39] <inscw00table> It's a tarball that is compressed, that I want to browse into without extracting.
[07:49:20] <__adrian> dunno then.
[07:49:25] <Blondie101010> browsing in what sense?
[07:49:44] <inscw00table> Read the files/contents get a listing.
[07:50:02] <Blondie101010> do you know tar?
[07:50:12] <inscw00table> I thought I did.
[07:50:15] <Blondie101010> it stores files sequentially
[07:50:40] <Blondie101010> so you'll need to decompress and read the archive until you get what you want
[07:50:54] <inscw00table> Yeah, that's fine.
[07:51:01] <Blondie101010> mostly making this compicated for the little gain you're probably looking for
[07:51:48] <Blondie101010> but, if I had to do this, I'd do it in bash with tar and the zipping option/util
[07:51:53] <inscw00table> The gain being not creating a bunch of files and then throwing them away?
[07:52:20] <Rockwood> Blondie101010, o/
[07:52:33] <Blondie101010> if you read the tar archive sequentially, you'll eventually encounter the file name you're looking for
[07:53:00] <Blondie101010> there's no reason to store the parts you don't want, and tar supports Muliple ways to filter things
[07:54:23] <inscw00table> Well, if I'm doing it with native utils, yes.
[07:54:35] <Blondie101010> why do you need that done in PHP?
[07:55:28] <inscw00table> Well, I generally try to do things in the language I am in first, and then call out to other things only when I need to.  I didn't expect to have so much trouble getting php to read tarballs.
[07:56:10] <inscw00table> Python's tarfile for example just does all this stuff natively, so I kind of assumed there would be similar functionality.
[07:56:19] <Blondie101010> you can look at https://packagist.org/?query=tar
[07:56:58] * inscw00table nods, yup.  Been there.
[07:57:33] <Blondie101010> but I strongly advise you to reconsider your approach
[07:57:46] <Blondie101010> it is limiting and in this case very expensive

[08:17:42] <Sammitch> also there's no "official" tar spec, and several different flavors, and then whole thing kind of sucks to deal with
[08:18:33] <inscw00table> Yeah, I wasn't really aware of that mess until today.  Used to just dealing with gnu tar... which it seems is also a weirdo format, just a generally usable one.
[08:18:34] <Sammitch> oh and all the specs that _were_ written were in like 1970, so there's no actual spec, just some arcane reference implentations
[08:20:45] <Sammitch> if you really want to mess around with the tar binary there's always proc_open()
[08:21:50] <inscw00table> Yeah, I would probably go that route, if I do decide to go the os native tools way.
[08:23:10] *** Joins: gde33 (~gde33@84-106-154-98.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl)
[08:24:48] <Blondie101010> just keep in mind that if you don't save it to disk, you use that amount of RAM
[08:24:59] <Blondie101010> it counts a lot for big files
[08:25:14] <inscw00table> Well, I am saving it to disk.
[08:25:26] <inscw00table> I just wanted to do that exclusively as the compressed tarball.
[08:25:34] <Blondie101010> you probably just need to shell_exec() the right tar command
[08:25:45] <inscw00table> And just peek into it for what I needed, without any tempfile garbage.
[08:26:56] <Blondie101010> tar allows you to list the contents, but as I previously described, that requires your computer to decompress and parse the whole archive
[08:28:00] <Blondie101010> so if you have to look into it before you extract something, you might as well do it the other way around
[08:28:11] <Blondie101010> at least take it in consideration
[08:28:37] <Blondie101010> with proper tar filters, you should be able to get what you want
[08:30:03] <inscw00table> Yeah.  I was originally thinking I would always extract it once the first access, and then keep the extracted contents around in some LRU scheme, and delete them after a while.  But, it seems that decompressing, scanning, returning is extremely fast on the small files I'm working with.
[08:31:14] <Blondie101010> that makes me think of man pages
[08:31:37] <Blondie101010> the auto-decompression has been in place for 30 years
[08:32:01] <Blondie101010> for cleanup, a simple service does the job
[08:33:23] <TML> inscw00table: Is this something you're doing in-band in an HTTP request?
[08:33:30] <inscw00table> Yes.
[08:33:52] <Blondie101010> with uploaded contents?
[08:33:58] <inscw00table> Yes.
[08:34:08] <Blondie101010> hope you jailed that well
[08:34:14] <inscw00table> Previously uploaded contents.
[08:34:30] <TML> inscw00table: I think your best bet is to flip this problem on its head
[08:35:15] <Blondie101010> it probably depends on how tight they are in storage
[08:35:17] <TML> inscw00table: When someone uploads the zstd'd tar file, you: 1) Decompress it; 2) untar it; 3) zstd compress each individual component of the unpacked directory; 4) tar the compressed files
[08:35:44] <TML> Then you can use Phar to pluck the desired file out of the tar and either deliver zstd or decompress it as it flies by
[08:36:23] <TML> it should only be a marginal amount of additional disk space, but will show massive improvements in memory and CPU usage
[08:36:37] <Blondie101010> very good idea

[08:39:32] <TML> and we found that, in practice, the overall disk usage was only about 7-8% higher than doing compression on the archive as a whole
[08:39:50] <TML> thought we were using gzip, not zstd, so you might find a wider gap
[08:40:01] <inscw00table> Although, it is unfortunate that if I serve the final artifact, it will be inconvenient to use as a human being.
[08:40:10] <TML> inscw00table: What do you mean?
[08:40:42] <inscw00table> Well, if the final tarball is a tar of a hundred zst compressed files, a human being is gonna have to extract those to use them.
[08:41:05] <inscw00table> If they wanted to crack it open themselves.
[08:42:20] <TML> how often are you delivering the entire tar?

[08:42:57] <TML> I guess you have to decide which use-case is more important to solve for - unless you know you have enough disk space to keep both versions around

[08:43:54] <TML> I can tell you that, in the situation I was in, the gain by flipping it around was one of those once-in-a-lifetime improvements in an application

[22:44:49] <TrippyJ> I can tell you my problems relipse, and you can learn how NOT to code.
[22:45:05] <relipse> go ahead TrippyJ
[22:45:27] <TrippyJ> Actually, I just got my most recent thing working, maybe it can be improved?
[22:45:33] <TrippyJ> It is a round robin system for distributing leads
[22:46:14] <TrippyJ> https://3v4l.org/cdl7A
[22:46:50] <TrippyJ> What I do, is I have a table of agents and a field called "assigned", when they get a lead, it gets changed to a 1. Only a person with a 0 can get a lead.
[22:47:01] <TrippyJ> If nobody has a zero, they all get reset to zero.
[22:47:24] <TrippyJ> This actually works for distributing the leads evenly between the unique agents found in the roundrobin table
[22:47:43] <TrippyJ> I commented and put a lot of echo in it to explain the logic, but I am sure it is an ugly mess
[22:48:16] <da_wunder> one thing that you could improve, is to use strict comparison instead loose one
[22:48:17] <TrippyJ> CRON runs this script once every 5 minutes to funnel leads out to agents

[22:49:02] <da_wunder> yes
[22:50:26] <da_wunder> and another thing is that you could just collect those "echo ..." stuff inside that loop to eg. array and then after that loop just do something like `echo implode('<br />', $messages);`
[22:52:35] <da_wunder> and for lines 48:52 - you could just make query like `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE ...` - no need to select that agent and lead - because you don't really use those at all
[22:53:51] <da_wunder> and then lines 54:55 why to use two different if statements where you could use `if (...) { } elseif {...}` - imho easier to understand what is really going on
[22:53:53] <TrippyJ> Ah, yeah
[22:54:14] <TrippyJ> Man you're good, da_wunder
[22:54:49] <TrippyJ> Isn't COUNT(*) slow, though? Can I just only select id or something?
