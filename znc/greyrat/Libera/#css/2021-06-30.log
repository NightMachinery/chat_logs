[00:00:53] <aiena> hassoon: wait goofed up a bit
[00:01:37] <aiena> yes the /309 fiddle is right
[00:03:36] <hassoon> aiena: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/310
[00:04:36] <aiena> hassoon: what change did you make?
[00:05:39] <hassoon> aiena: line 79  and a div{padding:1px} rule, i commented the former, and removed the lattezr
[00:05:43] <hassoon> ù latter
[00:05:45] <hassoon> *
[00:06:34] <aiena> hmm now I cannot see the second panel at all if I replace the contents in my text.html and test.css with the data in the fiddle
[00:06:39] <aiena> in /310
[00:06:51] <aiena> *test.html

[00:24:02] <johtso> new to css, probably doing a lot of stupid things.. puzzled as to why my element is only being centered horizontally, and also why the input and the buttons seemed to be aligned slightly different vertically.. https://play.tailwindcss.com/U2ck9CUvB8?file=css

[00:26:43] <aiena> maybe it might be better to ask the tailwind devs/forums
[00:27:14] <johtso> aiena: I can do if it's better suited there, but thought seeing as it's nothing tailwind specific better to ask here
[00:28:33] <aiena> hmm maybe someone here can help you too.
[00:33:24] <johtso> okay, figured out the centering.. I needed to make my body take up the full vertical height to be able to center something vertically within it https://play.tailwindcss.com/WIO2xu1041?file=css
[00:33:45] <johtso> the puzzle of the vertical alignment of the buttons and input remains

[01:08:22] <aiena> well all of them are giving different results

[01:09:38] <aiena> i am too sleepy I would like to learn more. I think I will make a dummy example and play with it.

[01:13:04] <aiena> hmm
[01:15:46] <aiena> yes hassoon it works correctly more or less. WHy does flex centre not work?
[01:18:16] <aiena> I mean "justify-content: center;"
[01:19:29] <hassoon> where
[01:19:49] <aiena> in .container
[01:20:15] <aiena> I think I'll try to understand how flexboxes work tomorrow.
[01:21:03] <aiena> This is something good enough for now. Looks bad but functional. I use the plugin personally so ugly but functional os progress already.

[18:21:46] <DrowningElysium> Hey, I could use some help with https://jsfiddle.net/DrowningElysium/mqnxryL6/17/ Currently I want the search bar to take up the left over space. The other problem I am facing is that I have too many items and it goes underneath each other. Is there a good solution for that. Also I know Bootstrap 3 is old. But we need a little bit more time to transfer over our system (10 year old system and quite huge)
[18:34:17] <bambanxx> why col class div is not showing like 4 columns ? https://codesandbox.io/s/nice-noether-grid-area-css-rmfz4?file=/index.html
[18:47:52] <entuland> DrowningElysium, use flex
[18:48:25] <DrowningElysium> So basically write the navigation bar from scratch? entuland ?
[18:48:43] <entuland> no, just override whatever is styling that section
[18:49:03] <hunboy> DrowningElysium, simplified testcase : https://jsfiddle.net/zpw709cm/
[18:49:40] <DrowningElysium> Yeah, I was working from a bootstrap 3 base. But I would then just have to write it myself
[18:49:57] <DrowningElysium> As bootstrap uses floats and stuff as a base still
[18:50:18] *** Quits: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:50:52] <entuland> bambanxx, not sure I get what you mean, there are definitely 4 columns there, you simply aren't using them
[18:51:13] <entuland> or you're not using them properly
[18:51:31] <entuland> point out the exact elements you'd want in those 4 columns
[18:53:43] <bambanxx> entuland col divs 4 columns
[18:54:51] <entuland> don't think you can use the areas like that
[18:55:18] <entuland> if you set "grid-column: 4;" on the fourth div, you'll see it will get moved to the 4 column
[18:55:31] <entuland> right now you're stashing them all to take the entire "col" area
[18:56:38] <entuland> either that, or give different names to each cell - say, col1, col2 and so forth
[18:57:01] <bambanxx> oh i understand thanks
[18:57:03] <entuland> s/to each cell/to each area
[18:57:04] <entuland> yw
[18:57:32] <bambanxx> this time col is taking whole width
[18:58:09] <entuland> well, you should think of areas as a single "cell" that spans over multiple _real_ cells in the main grid
[18:58:46] <entuland> there are various ways to achieve such divisions - say, you could have put those 4 divs into a wrapper, then give such a wrapper whatever grid you like
[18:59:15] <entuland> so that you can have a 3 cols grid into a single cell covering 4 columns on the parent grid
[18:59:33] <bambanxx> entuland into a wrapper using grid area is possible?
[18:59:36] <entuland> just pick the one that feels more logical depending on the semantic markup
[18:59:51] <entuland> sure, you can nest as you better prefer
[19:00:29] * bambanxx i tried to do using a wrapper but didnt realize ho
[19:00:40] <entuland> I'll show you
[19:00:50] <bambanxx> thanks you my friend :D
[19:04:29] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/duezyfj5/
[19:04:54] <entuland> notice how the nested grids don't care about how they get resized, they simply split their own space
[19:07:08] <bambanxx> let me check
[19:08:29] <bambanxx> entuland interesting example
[19:08:42] <bambanxx> thanks you very much i will save to study in deep

[19:08:56] <hassoon> * afternoon
[19:09:48] <bambanxx> hey hassoon
[19:10:10] <bambanxx> entuland what means this: repeat(5, 1fr);
[19:11:52] <entuland> the same as "1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr"
[19:12:52] <bambanxx> (xtimes, this )
[19:12:53] <bambanxx> ok
[19:12:55] <bambanxx> nice
[19:13:00] <bambanxx> thanks you entuland
[19:13:38] <entuland> yw
[19:14:18] <entuland> you should be able to mix and match - say, "grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr) 50%;"
[19:14:54] <entuland> that would be the same as saying the last column takes half the space, the first three columns take "50% divided by three" each
[19:17:23] <bambanxx> grid is game changer

[20:49:13] <drew> I created a div for the background image on this site, but the div ends up being 0px big. How can I get it to cover the whole page?

[20:58:14] <entuland> why not set the background directly to the body element?
[20:59:13] <entuland> the issue you're having there is actually the width, though
[20:59:53] <drew> I did that, but then I wasn't able to apply style to just the background image without it applying to the text as well
[20:59:56] <entuland> you could give it 100% width, but you'd end up with an horizontal scrollbar
[21:00:14] <entuland> cause you have it placed as relative and would make a mess
[21:00:18] <drew> for instance opacity: .50 would just make the text transparent, not the background image
[21:00:19] <entuland> you could place it as position: fixed
[21:01:24] *** Quits: jonifen (~jonifen@user/jonifen) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:01:28] <entuland> and you could use "inset: 0;" (shorthand for left, top, right and bottom at once)
[21:01:34] <entuland> without having to give it any width or height
[21:03:01] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/o4lTq6h.jpg
[21:03:37] <entuland> by doing the above the background would go above your countdown, so you'll need to give the countdown position: relative or something to deal with the z-index
[21:05:49] <drew> I did position: fixed, inset: 0, and z-index: -1 to get the same effect. Is it bad practice to set z-index manually?
[21:06:30] <entuland> nah, it's okay
[21:09:00] <drew> so position: fixed, and inset: 0 dictate to fix the image with no margins, versus before with relative, it was stacking itself after the countdown timer, right?
[21:09:19] <entuland> no, it's not about the image
[21:09:24] <entuland> it's about the element
[21:09:45] <drew> the <div> element
[21:09:50] <entuland> eyp
[21:09:56] <entuland> yep*
[21:10:27] <entuland> when you say "relative" it means "let me move this around, but pretend the element is still there so that it still takes the space and pushes stuff around"
[21:11:07] <entuland> when you say absolute or fixed, you're actually removing it from its current context and "freeing" the space as if it had never been there
[21:11:59] <entuland> that's why setting it as relative and forcing it to grow messed up with the scrollbars
[21:12:57] <drew> ok, because I was scrolling down to see the space that the div was taking up?
[21:13:29] *** chao is now known as stenno
[21:13:38] <drew> or rather, it gave scrollbars to scroll to the space that the div was taking up?
[21:13:40] <entuland> not sure what you saw when you altered it, when I gave your original version full width, it caused an horizontal scrollbar to appear
[21:14:04] <entuland> cause it was stacking with the counter or something
[21:16:30] <drew> ok I set min-width and relative to see and I see the scrollbars. So that's because relative is reserving space for the bg element, whereas I want to just fix it and then all the space can be used by the countdown container
[21:36:24] <entuland> yes, relative preserves the original space even if you move the element completely out of sight or something

[23:04:22] <drew> on the same site, I switched to a video background: http://staging.timetil.camp
[23:05:40] <drew> but I have noticed that it does not autoplay on mobile and I would like to have the video span height instead of width, but switching to min-height:100% seems to hide the video

[23:07:59] <AhmedAmerican> any recommendation for simple email template ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68198738/jinja2-email-template
[23:21:04] <entuland> drew, there are data saving considerations to be taken in account on mobile
[23:21:23] <drew> that makes sense
[23:21:33] <drew> I think I got the video to maximize, btw
[23:21:38] <drew> thanks for all the help entuland
[23:21:51] <entuland> I personally seriously dislike such control-less videos, it frustrates me the inability to pause / rewind it
[23:22:16] <drew> yeah I can see how it could be weilded in an annoying way
[23:22:52] <entuland> it also makes text overlaid on it less accessible
[23:23:22] <entuland> there are moments where the white text on the very clear background may be almost unreadable to some people with low contrast perception
[23:23:51] <entuland> such contrast is also heavily affected by the quality of the display
[23:24:00] <hassoon> text with text-shadow is your friend
[23:24:41] <entuland> it may help somewhat, but some displays are seriously bad, with colors getting heavily altered depending on the viewing angle
[23:25:33] <hassoon> entuland: meh the user just needs to keep their face facing the device directly
[23:26:19] <entuland> still, I'm in favor of making the UX as friendly as possible
[23:28:43] <hassoon> what was that about anyway ? avoiding setting videos as backgrounds ?
[23:29:07] <entuland> that is a personal preference of mine, I don't like them
[23:30:06] <hassoon> it won't hurt if the video is kept transparent or barely remarkable, in fact that might give a nice effect
[23:30:15] <hassoon> but a plain obvious video is a pain of course
[23:30:54] <entuland> drew, there are techniques to have elements fill all the available space still retaining their aspect ratio
[23:31:19] <entuland> the same with the "cover" technique of the background images
[23:31:35] <entuland> but such techniques involving full elements are somewhat more complex
[23:33:02] <entuland> s/the same with/similar to
[23:34:10] <entuland> actually, it may have been made simpler, check this one out: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit

[23:46:26] <drew> I guess one of the problems I have introduced is the two wrappers around the iframe
[23:46:52] <drew> I read about it here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/60228328/3888080
[23:47:04] <drew> but surely there is a way to use object-fit appropriately here
[23:48:36] <entuland> mixing different techniques up may definitely mess with the result
