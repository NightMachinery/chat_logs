[00:00:24] <manicennui> The animation is amazing.
[00:00:37] <dimadima> i've gone back and forth a lot about the extent to which the letter skeuomorphism should be in place
[00:00:45] <dimadima> skeuomorphisms are tricky
[00:00:57] <dimadima> what do you like about the animation
[00:01:19] <manicennui> It basically looks like a Studio Ghibli work.
[00:01:51] <manicennui> Very lush and lots of plants and flowers.
[00:02:11] <manicennui> Some amazing shots of the stars too.

[00:07:33] <dimadima> nice. i wonder what the japanese original for violet evergarden would be
[00:09:11] <manicennui> It's possible that they use the English. I've seen it done in a lot of anime.
[00:09:17] <manicennui> If you listen to the Japanese audio.

And that Apple abandoned PPC because PPC was hot and power-hungry and they judged that
[23:16:16] <quanticle> there was no way that they were going to be able to get a PPC chip to be as power efficient as a comparable Intel part?
[23:16:53] <quanticle> Using PPC in a laptop is a really confusing choice, given that.

[23:25:55] <dimadima> Brekkjern: I believe NaN !== NaN, too
[23:26:29] <dimadima> fortunately real life usecases of NaN are NaN-existant in my experience
[23:26:48] <dimadima> all that insane bullshit ppl point out about JS might be true, but trivially avoidable
[23:27:09] <indigo> dimadima: Wow, and that's with adblock too
[23:27:13] <dimadima> for starters, ==, never use it
[23:27:17] <dimadima> indigo: yes it's insane
[23:27:24] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Yeah. This seems to be a thing in most languages though
[23:27:46] <jjuran> There's a conflation between floating point values as numbers and floating point values as bitstrings
[23:27:47] <Brekkjern> Java, JS, Python, C
[23:27:47] <dimadima> Brekkjern: bad parts of the language or something else?
[23:28:01] <Brekkjern> No, the behaviour of nan is similar in all those languages
[23:28:05] <dimadima> oh yeah
[23:28:37] <jjuran> There are a bunch of different bit patterns that are all considered NaN
[23:28:58] <jjuran> And two zeros
[23:29:06] <companion_cube> even then, with the same bit pattern, nan != nan normally
[23:29:10] <dimadima> jjuran: oh are you saying some NaNs are === ?
[23:29:21] <dimadima> that would be awesome
[23:29:26] <jjuran> dimadima: I'm not saying anything about what that operator does
[23:29:44] <Brekkjern> This feels like one of those things where someone made a dumb decision waaaaay back in the days without realizing the consequences, and now we have to deal with it :S
[23:30:27] <companion_cube> well it makes kind of sense I suppose
[23:30:36] <companion_cube> if you have some nan==nan, and others be distinct
[23:30:41] <companion_cube> (based on bit patterns)
[23:30:43] <Brekkjern> a = float("nan")
[23:30:43] <Brekkjern> b = float("nan")
[23:30:43] <Brekkjern> a is b
[23:30:43] <Brekkjern> > False
[23:30:43] <Brekkjern> a == b
[23:30:45] <Brekkjern> > False
[23:30:45] <companion_cube> it's super weird as well
[23:30:45] <quanticle> I don't know if I would characterize IEEE 754 as "dumb". It's more like they made a decision that made sense when 64-bit numbers were things that you'd only find in HPC clusters.
[23:30:54] <gerikson> NaN != naan
[23:31:12] <jjuran> I'm saying `float x = foo(); float y = bar(); memcmp(&x, &y, sizeof (float)) == 0` could eval as false when x and y are both NaNs or both zero
[23:31:14] <companion_cube> _maybe_ they could have found a way to have only one nan
[23:31:15] <Brekkjern> That up there is Python, and I find that behaviour somewhat confusing
[23:31:29] <companion_cube> but then it's also true that nan>nan, nan<nan, nan>= nan, etc. are all false
[23:31:39] <companion_cube> so making it so that nan==nan is weird anyway
[23:31:45] <Brekkjern> I understand why the "is" test fails, but it's annoying that there's no real way to check for nan-ness...
[23:32:00] <companion_cube> isn't there a classification function?
[23:32:06] <companion_cube> I have one in OCaml
[23:32:14] <jjuran> Naan is definitely not a number, but it is tasty
[23:32:24] <Brekkjern> I bet there is, but I don't have to interact with nan all that much, so I don't know.
[23:32:36] <gerikson> gotta be host 'n fresh tho
[23:32:43] <Brekkjern> But I do know that when I stumble across it the next time, it will inevitably be a fuckhuge bug...
[23:35:03] <jjuran> I'm seriously considering just outlawing `==` for floats in my language
[23:36:40] <Brekkjern> Probably smart
[23:37:05] <Brekkjern> Also, don't make your implementation of "isNumber" return either the number, or nan... That's also a recipe for disaster..
[23:44:38] <jjuran> I think it would be valuable to distinguish between "perfect" numbers like ints and ratios, and lossy numbers like floats.
