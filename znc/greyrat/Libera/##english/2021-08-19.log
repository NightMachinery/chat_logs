[00:03:53] <CuriosTiger> but I've only been to Trondheim once, so that impression is also limited. Awesome dialect though.

[04:50:45] <LjL> This verb [awaken], for many speakers, has been essentially conflated with the verb awake, and has adopted parts of awake’s conjugation. awaken remains the bare form (and also in awakens and awakening), but its simple past and past participle are replaced by those of awake: awoke and awoken, respectively. For many others, awaken has simply supplanted awake, without adopting conjugational elements from awake.
[04:51:14] <LjL> so it's not that i specifically want to use "waken" as its own verb, it's just that there's a bunch of variations on wake, waken, awake, awaken, each with their own past tenses that kinda overlap

[13:42:35] <blkshp> would want and want are the same thing.
[13:43:10] <hornhack> so when I say "bless you" when someone sneezes, it is a PSA? what is PSA?
[13:43:27] <Voxel> Are you sure? I mean, for example, "- 'Should I remove this cable?'. 'I'd suggest you leave it. What if...'"
[13:44:52] <blkshp> Voxel: how is that related, it doesn't contain the word 'want' 
[13:45:13] <blkshp> hornhack: Doesn't make sense to me.
[13:45:18] <blkshp> Where is this from?
[13:46:21] <hornhack> heh, looks like PSA is not what I think it means
[13:46:31] <hornhack> so the story is like this
[13:46:35] <Voxel> "- 'Should I remove this cable?'. 'I'd suggest you leave it. What if you... want to install a server in this place in the near future...'"
[13:48:08] <blkshp> Yes, just as it is there, "..what if you want.."
[13:48:28] <blkshp> Though i may use "need" instead of "want".
[13:48:38] <hornhack> this kid sees a commercial that says "What do you say to someone after they cough?" - "Robitussin" so the kid keeps saying "Robitussin" when someone coughs because they think its a PSA. So I guess PSA means something like that
[13:51:55] <Voxel> I encountered something the same. Someone was talking about transphobic and mentioned PSA.
[13:52:22] <blkshp> hornhack: no idea what any of that means lol
[13:52:37] <blkshp> The only PSA i am familiar with is Public Service announcement
[13:52:49] <Voxel> Pharmaceutical Society of Australia
[13:53:10] <Voxel> Prostate-Specific Antigen
[13:53:20] <hornhack> lol, interesting blkshp Voxel 
[13:54:06] <Voxel> Perhaps, it's related to ethics, but "psa ethics" didn't return any relative enough material.

[13:55:06] <Voxel> Thank you, blkshp
[14:01:10] <twb> I believe USians use "PSA" in the sense blkshp described
[14:01:18] <twb> I always assumed it meant "Please Stop Asking"
[14:01:47] <twb> Because I saw it in posts like "PSA: Yes, I'm gay" or "PSA: my dog recovered from her hip transplant"

[17:55:28] <StayHungry> Voxel: basically, you're trying to amplify adjective 'splendid' by 'crystal' as adverb by analogy with 'order is crystal clear' (_certainly_ as clear as crystalline solid) or 'lipstick is bright red' (_precisely_ the intensified shade of given color), but in what way 'crystal' (something clear) could amplify 'splendid' (something that already shines unclouded)? however, you could amplify your feelings and thoughts -> 'the

[20:20:53] <pussipupu> I found an official MS keyboard editor, but it's weirdly limited
[20:20:58] <blkshp> You don't (or rather I don't so I don't know)
[20:21:18] <pussipupu> Valid answer
[20:21:29] <pussipupu> I suspect one can't, at least not at the obvious level

[21:05:54] <pussipupu> Fair enough, the impression I've had is that it was pretty settled but I won't pretend to be an expert

[22:05:05] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, the virus doesn't particularly care about your immigration status.
[22:05:37] <CuriosTiger> I'm facing another bureaucratic hurdle with Norway. They only accept proof of vaccine that is in their system. Which involves taking my US-issued vaccination card and convincing a Norwegian doctor it's legit.

[22:05:54] <pussipupu> I'll get the jumper  cables
[22:06:04] <CuriosTiger> of course, this ordinarily requires you to be in Norway to see said doctor, which is a bit of a chicken and egg problem. But apparently you can show them the card over a telemedicine appointment now.
[22:06:04] <Remavas> Does Norway accept the EU certificates?
[22:06:21] <CuriosTiger> EU, yes, but only if they're in the EU's digital system. Paper printouts are insufficient.

[22:06:42] <Remavas> They have a unique ID and QR code
[22:06:46] <CuriosTiger> and since the US has declared that they will not issue vaccine passport, there's no equivalent US system

[22:07:13] <pussipupu> The QR code link...

[22:09:22] <CuriosTiger> I have a little cardboard card with stickers on it showing my first and second shots.
[22:09:23] <Remavas> I just accidentally discovered it when browsing through my health records
[22:09:41] <Remavas> (Online)
[22:09:43] <CuriosTiger> You can buy those on eBay. Supposedly, they can be verified with the Palm Beach County health authority
[22:09:58] <CuriosTiger> None of my records are online yet
[22:10:17] <Remavas> Here they go online immediately heh
[22:10:27] <CuriosTiger> I should probably book a telemedicine appointment with a Norwegian doctor to correct that, but I think I'll hold off until I'm ready to travel
[22:10:35] <CuriosTiger> the rules change sixteen times per month
[22:10:46] <pussipupu> !wik Palm Beach County
[22:10:54] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: Americans have a bit of a trust issue with their government
[22:11:06] <StayHungry> a bit :D
[22:11:13] <pussipupu> It's weird that the US has counties but not counts
[22:11:14] <CuriosTiger> there's also a jurisdictional challenge, with separate authorities from municipal to federal
[22:11:34] <pussipupu> Anyone sensible has an issue with governments, and the US government possible moreso than most
[22:11:35] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: Every count-ry should have counts.
[22:11:56] <Remavas> I mean I don't trust mine too much either, but their encryption standards seem ok
[22:12:11] <Remavas> Plus it's not like my medical history is anything amazing
[22:12:33] <CuriosTiger> No, but it's still private.
[22:12:46] <Remavas> Well, good luck accessing it
[22:12:47] <pussipupu> Mine wants to ban encryption and tries to every so often
[22:12:53] <CuriosTiger> For example, I don't mind telling you that I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but a prospective employer might use that to decide not to hire me.
[22:13:03] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: I don't want to access it.
[22:13:03] <Remavas> pussipupu, what country would that be
[22:13:10] <CuriosTiger> but I understand the need for privacy.
[22:13:11] <pussipupu> UK
[22:13:13] <Remavas> CuriosTiger, I meant in general
[22:13:17] <StayHungry> pussipupu: in the case of the United States, distrust is embedded in the foundation of the state -> there is a name, but everything else is fragmented
[22:13:23] <Remavas> pussipupu, oof, well the EU is not better at times
[22:13:25] <CuriosTiger> At the same time, I feel I should have the right to disclose my OWN medical information to anyone I see fit
[22:13:27] <Remavas> "regulate encryption"
[22:13:33] <pussipupu> To be fair, those who what to ban it don't understand the question, but that's true of most of their  policies
[22:13:33] <CuriosTiger> including the right to voluntarily carry a vaccine passport if I so choose.
[22:13:39] <CuriosTiger> but that is currently illegal in my state.
[22:14:19] <pussipupu> StayHungry: Not really no, at least not from what I see, lots of Muricans very much trust Murica
[22:14:25] <pussipupu> Or their visions of it
[22:14:36] <Remavas> Big Uncle Sam
[22:14:55] <Remavas> CuriosTiger, what do you mean by illegal? 
[22:15:15] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: It is illegal for entities in Florida to issue or request vaccine passports
[22:15:19] <pussipupu> And Remavas, sadly agreed on the EU
[22:15:33] <pussipupu> CuriosTiger: what about vaccine blockchains?

[22:15:56] <pussipupu> How much of the problem is one of nomencleture?
[22:16:12] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: I don't think the governor understands the concept of a blockchain, so that's probably safe, albeit useless.
[22:16:30] <Remavas> I have my own country's vaccine passport too, but it also allows people who have been sick with COVID19 to also get it too
[22:16:37] <Remavas> For like half a year or so
[22:16:41] <pussipupu> The Estonian government seems to have a severe Blockchain Hardon
[22:16:55] <pussipupu> Whether that's better or worse I'll leave as an exercise for the reader
[22:17:11] <Remavas> They have a hard-on for anything with electronic in its name

[22:17:20] <CuriosTiger> I think they are leveraging the synergies in emerging technologies.
[22:17:30] <CuriosTiger> </buzzwords>
[22:17:37] <pussipupu> And all based on blockchain, indeed
[22:17:58] <pussipupu> I wanna go back to Estonia though, we barely scratched the surface of Tallinn
[22:18:08] <Remavas> I should go there
[22:18:10] <CuriosTiger> I've never made it to the baltic states
[22:18:18] <Remavas> The only thing that separates me and Estonia is Latvia
[22:18:22] <CuriosTiger> but I have to admit, they are not at the top of my list.
[22:18:34] <CuriosTiger> more a "that would be nice someday"
[22:18:36] <pussipupu> I'd like to visit Latvia too
[22:18:42] <pussipupu> I hear the booze is even cheaper than Estonia
[22:19:02] <pussipupu> (though most of the booze I drink these days I make, so it's not taxed)
[22:19:41] <StayHungry> .w crapulence
[22:19:42] <Remavas> booze here in Lithuania, I don't know, it's been a while since I checked the prices since I don't drink
[22:19:43] <tinsoldier> crapulence — Noun: 1. sickness or indisposition caused by excessive eating or drinking, 2. intemperance; debauchery; excessive indulgence https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crapulence
[22:19:45] <CuriosTiger> I don't see getting drunk as a major motivator for travel. If I were so inclined, I could do that at home.
[22:20:02] <CuriosTiger> as it is, I may have..ten drinks per year, if that?
[22:20:03] <Remavas> but I think it should be similar to Estonia
[22:20:12] <Remavas> definitely more expensive than Latvia
[22:20:21] <pussipupu> I see it as worth checking if one is travelling anyway
[22:20:25] <pussipupu> And has spare baggage allowance
[22:20:33] <CuriosTiger> Besides, isn't Russia the king of cheap alcohol in Europe?
[22:20:39] <Remavas> If you want a visa
[22:20:48] <pussipupu> I'd need a visa to drive to Russia
[22:20:51] <Remavas> The Schengen area is great
[22:20:56] <Remavas> You can drive somewhere
[22:20:57] <CuriosTiger> So would I
[22:20:59] <Remavas> get booze
[22:21:01] <Remavas> then return
[22:21:08] <pussipupu> And also to drive a lot, and I'd want to be actually properly visiting to bother with that drive
[22:21:11] <CuriosTiger> in fact, the reason I haven't been to Russia is that I didn't get a visa when I wanted one
[22:21:27] <huf> bit weird how it's hard to get one
[22:21:35] <Remavas> is it really
[22:21:41] <huf> yeah
[22:21:44] <Remavas> (weird that is)
[22:21:44] <CuriosTiger> I was trying for a private visa rather than a tourist visa, which required my Russian citizen sponsor to get an invitation letter from OVIR.
[22:21:45] <huf> most people dont want to go to russia
[22:21:52] <huf> so it should be perfectly fine to make it easy for tourists
[22:21:53] <huf> no risk
[22:22:03] <Remavas> Politically it makes sense
[22:22:04] <huf> ah
[22:22:04] <pussipupu> I'd quite like to go to Russia
[22:22:09] <CuriosTiger> Unfortunately, they discovered that, unbeknownst to me, he had bribed his way out of military service a few years prior.
[22:22:17] <huf> :)
[22:22:21] <Remavas> Good on him
[22:22:22] <StayHungry> .w unbeknownst
[22:22:23] <tinsoldier> unbeknownst — Adverb: 1. (followed by to) without the knowledge of https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unbeknownst
[22:22:25] <pussipupu> Ideally with a Culture drone just in case
[22:22:26] <CuriosTiger> so no invitation letter for him. Instead, he got re-drafted.
[22:22:29] <Remavas> The Russian military service is terrible
[22:22:46] <pussipupu> Military service is terrible
[22:23:00] <pussipupu> (obligatory that is)
[22:23:02] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: Yeah, and my friend was working for Motorola in St. Petersburg, so he didn't particularly want to go to Chechnya or whatever.
[22:23:14] <CuriosTiger> I can't say I blame him.
[22:23:37] <Remavas> Who can. Others get a doctor to create a false diagnosis
[22:23:42] * StayHungry brought some popcorn
[22:23:46] <CuriosTiger> In fact, I felt bad that the visit to OVIR got him in trouble, but I didn't know
[22:23:55] <huf> my mother was about to arrange that for me when they stopped the draft here :)
[22:24:09] <CuriosTiger> so I'm not sure how I could've anticipated it
[22:24:25] <Remavas> At least Lithuania allows to delay the service for university studies
[22:24:25] <pussipupu> Sympathy seems in order but not guilt
[22:24:30] <Remavas> luckily smh
[22:24:35] <huf> I got called in to have my lungs imaged (whatever that's called). you know, part of the physical check before you're drafted.
[22:24:36] <pussipupu> So depends what sort of feeling bad you're talking about
[22:24:36] <CuriosTiger> at any rate, no invitation letter, no visa. I scrapped my road trip to Russia and flew to Thailand instead.
[22:24:38] <huf> but they they abolished it
[22:24:49] <Remavas> huf, chest x-ray?
[22:24:52] <CuriosTiger> huf: Chest x-ray.
[22:24:54] <huf> yeah
[22:25:02] <CuriosTiger> I had to have one of those when I immigrated to the US
[22:25:04] <blkshp> No thank you
[22:25:05] <huf> there was supposed to be a lot more, but ... :)
[22:25:15] <pussipupu> They often do CAT scans of lungs these days
[22:25:18] <huf> some guy a few years older than me had to fake a terrible skin disease or whatever
[22:25:20] <CuriosTiger> They wanted to make sure I didn't have tuberculosis.
[22:25:21] <huf> to get out of it
[22:25:41] <Remavas> wouldn't it be easier to fake a heart disease
[22:25:41] <pussipupu> Which to be fair is also an X-ray but a less crap one
[22:25:43] <huf> CuriosTiger: I had to get some special paperwork cos I test positive for it
[22:25:46] <huf> since I have the vaccine
[22:26:05] <CuriosTiger> I have the vaccine too, but since the chest x-ray was clear, I was good to go.
[22:26:19] <pussipupu> For all that i bitch about my country, we don't have national service yet
[22:26:26] <pussipupu> So I didn't have to do any of this :þ

[22:26:57] <pussipupu> It's not on the books or anything
[22:27:02] <CuriosTiger> The US does not have it anymore. Norway has it, but they do allow civilian service as an alternative. And these days, if you tell them you don't want to go, they pretty much don't draft you.
[22:27:03] <Remavas> Lithuania got rid of it at one point

[22:28:09] <Remavas> ^
[22:28:14] <CuriosTiger> Agreed.
[22:28:27] <huf> drafting everyone has major "more women war criminals!" vibes
[22:28:30] <CuriosTiger> I mean...if the country's being invaded, sure, a draft is justified.
[22:28:35] <CuriosTiger> in peacetime? Not so much.

[22:39:38] <pussipupu> So yay that it's not subtle I guess?
[22:39:39] <CuriosTiger> especially since it deprived her of citizenship without a judicial process

[22:39:56] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Would you care if you yourself were stripped of citizenship?
[22:39:57] <Remavas> The word 'unbeknownst' was hitherto unknown to you, StayHungry.
[22:40:00] <pussipupu> Stupidity aside, she was a child when she made that decision
[22:40:11] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: Yes.
[22:40:16] <blkshp> If i joined a terrorist organisation i would undertand why people didn't care.
[22:40:28] <pussipupu> But leaving the specific case aside, the things that it shows them willing to do is the big story
[22:40:44] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: The definition of "terrorist organization" can be pretty fluid though.

[22:44:18] <twb> US convicts are enslaved and disenfranchised, though.
[22:44:21] <CuriosTiger> bin: My concern is that if you can strip her of citizenship with merely an administrative proceeding, you can do that to others too
[22:44:24] <bin> CuriosTiger: that's just a waste of resources
[22:44:28] <CuriosTiger> including, for example, political adversaries.
[22:44:43] <CuriosTiger> bin: I mean, we could empower police to simply shoot everyone suspected of a crime.
[22:44:59] <CuriosTiger> That would save a lot of resources, but justice might suffer a bit.
[22:45:19] <pussipupu> You might save a few resources but justice would be made a mockery
[22:45:25] <twb> CuriosTiger: that would violate Peelian principles; it would be a militia action, not a police action.
[22:45:26] <blkshp> I, like you don't know the details. Our law states that the Home secratary can deprive of uk citizenship if such conditions apply.
[22:45:35] <bin> there's no precedent for that happening outside of terrorism though and I don't really think it's as slippery a slope as that considering that she actively went to fight with terrorist forces. It's not like she never left and then said "I love ISIS" and they revoked it for that
[22:45:38] <twb> CuriosTiger: OTOH, USians generally don't seem to know of Peel
[22:45:39] <blkshp> The fact they're done means that they applied or were legally accepted to apply.
[22:45:54] <bin> It's kind of a false equivalency to say that it could just as easily be applied to political adversaries within the framework
[22:45:58] <blkshp> Therefore, i agree with it and have no sympathy for the person in order to consider considering they're wrong.
[22:46:27] <bin> twb: you have been asked more than once to not use "USian", why do you persist? 
[22:46:34] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: I don't have sympathy with the person. I have concerns about making the home secretary judge, jury and executioner
[22:46:54] <CuriosTiger> bin: It's a reductio ad absurdum, not an equivalency.
[22:46:58] <twb> here in Australia, journalists can be gaoled for 5 years for revealing the menu in the parliamentary canteen.
[22:46:58] <blkshp> Well i have concerns that anyone in America can own and shoot people but there we go
[22:47:08] <CuriosTiger> bin: Taking an argument to its logical extreme is a favored debate tool of mine. :)
[22:47:19] <blkshp> s/ own/ own guns/
[22:47:20] <chat> blkshp meant to say: Well i have concerns that anyone in America can own guns and shoot people but there we go
[22:47:22] <pussipupu> In universes where the Home Office and Home Secretary aren't repeatedly found to have broken the rules, that might almost work
[22:47:28] <bin> CuriosTiger: I'm saying that comparing poltical adversaries to terrorist combatants in a foreign country is a false equivalency
[22:47:29] <pussipupu> But it would still be against RoL
[22:47:35] <CuriosTiger> twb: Didn't Australia just have a scandal where half of Parliament was ineligible for office due to holding dual citizenship?
[22:47:52] <twb> CuriosTiger: no half.  About a dozen.
[22:48:05] <CuriosTiger> bin: Indeed it is. But if Priti Patel declared a political opponent a terrorist and stripped him of citizenship, which check or balance is in place to stop her?
[22:48:13] <CuriosTiger> it's obviously theoretical now
[22:48:24] <twb> CuriosTiger: there's a constitutional requirement that senators must not have allegiance to a foreign power
[22:48:27] <CuriosTiger> but I bear in mind, for example, that the US attempted to have John Lennon deported
[22:48:38] <bin> CuriosTiger: my understanding is that it only applies to enemy combatants not physically in the country.
[22:48:39] <twb> CuriosTiger: as what was called "hyphenated Americans" at the time
[22:48:41] <pussipupu> Does the Pope count as a foreign  power in this context?
[22:49:04] <twb> CuriosTiger: the trouble is, it's non-trivial to discover if you have citizenship privileges of foreign polities
[22:49:08] <pussipupu> We've apparently snuck into a papist in No.10 without challeng
[22:49:13] <twb> pussipupu: oddly, no
[22:49:23] <CuriosTiger> bin: Not just combatants. Anyone deemed a terrorist, as I understand it. So she waits until her political opponent is on vacation.
[22:49:27] <bin> CuriosTiger: you're acting like it was just the action of one person who arbitrarily decided this though
[22:49:36] <bin> It went to court and everything.
[22:49:56] <bin> It wasn't just a single person making a decision and then enacting it
[22:50:10] <twb> https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013Q00005 § 44
[22:50:25] <twb> "under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power; or"
[22:50:30] <CuriosTiger> bin: The only court case was around whether she had the right to challenge it in court. WHich was ultimately rejected.
[22:50:46] <pussipupu> Sounds like Papacy would count to be honest
[22:50:53] <CuriosTiger> bin: My understanding is that this power to strip citizenship rests with the UK Home Secretary and is not subject to judicial review.
[22:50:54] <bin> CuriosTiger: no, she was allowed to appeal it in court
[22:51:03] <pussipupu> Not saying it should, but it seems like a pretty silly rule in general
[22:51:05] <CuriosTiger> On 16 July 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled that Begum could return to the UK to contest the government's decision to rescind her British citizenship. It was unclear how she would return to the UK to plead her case, as the British government had previously stated that it would never let her return.[44]
[22:51:05] <CuriosTiger> On 26 February 2021, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in Begum v Home Secretary decided in favour of the Home Secretary on all grounds.[8][9]
[22:51:13] <twb> pussipupu: I agree, but I'm not a constitutional lawyer
[22:51:22] <CuriosTiger> bin: The Court of Appeal said she would be. The Supreme Court reversed.
[22:51:26] <pussipupu> The court ruling was whether she could return to the UK to challenge the stripping of citizenship
[22:51:40] <pussipupu> Not about whether she could have the citizenship reinstated
[22:51:42] <twb> pussipupu: I've always found the patriarchy's influence to be dubious at best
[22:52:03] <bin> CuriosTiger: right, so the court was involved in the decision. It wasn't taken lightly is my point
[22:52:19] <CuriosTiger> bin: I disagree. THe court was not involved.
[22:52:26] <twb> wouldn't it be easier to just declare da'esh fighters to be guilty of low treason
[22:52:33] <pussipupu> I mean, kinda same, but I'm not sure how much more sus it is than for instance all the American who claim to be Demonym Americans
[22:52:34] <CuriosTiger> The court case was about whether she could return to fight the decision. Effectively, it was about standing.
[22:52:41] <bin> CuriosTiger: it absolutely was. You just saidso yourself. The Supreme Court made the decision.
[22:52:52] <twb> what happened to british fighters in the spanish civil war?
[22:52:52] <CuriosTiger> bin: You're misunderstanding the subject of the court case.
[22:53:01] <bin> The Supreme Court decided she was a national security risk and should nto be allowed to return. That's the court deciding
[22:53:14] <bin> It wasn't a single individual making a declaration and then enacting it
[22:53:16] <CuriosTiger> That is not what the court decided.

[22:53:36] <pussipupu> Obviously that the Vatican as a state is basically a criminal organisation fundamentally is an issue, but most Catholics I know dont' actually hold allegiance to that state
[22:53:41] <CuriosTiger> The court decided "On Friday, Lord Reed, president of the Supreme Court, said the government had been entitled to prevent Ms Begum from returning to the UK."
[22:53:47] <bin> "the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in Begum v Home Secretary decided in favour of the Home Secretary on all grounds."
[22:53:48] <pussipupu> They didn't rule on the citizenship
[22:53:58] <twb> pussipupu: don't they *in principle*?
[22:54:15] <twb> pussipupu: and they're bound by both canon law and local law?
[22:54:16] <bin> "The Supreme Court [...] decided [...]"
[22:54:21] <CuriosTiger> bin: "Was Shamima Begum legally deprived of citizenship" was not one of those grounds.
[22:54:23] <blkshp> And that's the law.
[22:54:28] <bin> idk how you can say they weren't involved when they made the decision 
[22:54:34] <blkshp> The supreme court decided she was not entitled to have it quashed.
[22:54:34] <StayHungry> ##english turned into an embassy of ##politics ,)
[22:54:37] <pussipupu> They don't follow canon law though as a general rule
[22:54:41] <blkshp> I think we're getting to the end of this
[22:54:54] <pussipupu> Far less than they follow local temporal law :þ
[22:55:43] <pussipupu> The removal of citizenship has not been ruled on, that she can be stopped from returning to appeal that decision has been
[22:56:25] <pussipupu> (The court of appeal had previously ruled otherwise on the  latter issue)
[22:56:28] <bin> pussipupu: which, by extension, means that the removal of her citizenship is valid. 
[22:57:01] <pussipupu> No, it doesn't
[22:57:19] <pussipupu> That wasn't what was being appealed and wasn't ruled on
[22:57:26] <marianne> Hei!
[22:57:53] <pussipupu> It means she can't return to the UK to challenge the decision to remove her citizenship
[22:57:57] <pussipupu> Terve marianne :)
[22:58:36] <pussipupu> Would you mind if I sent you a private message, marianne ?
[22:59:16] <bin> pussipupu: right, so if she were to be able to communicate remotely with lawyers she could theoretically appeal, but even upon appeal the chance of reinstatement is low. She's not remorseful at all.
[22:59:34] <pussipupu> I don't care whether you think she's remorseful
[22:59:52] <pussipupu> You're wrong on the point of law and being loudly and confidently wrong doesn't make you less wrong
[23:00:20] <bin> which point of law? That the court was involved with the decision of not allowing return for apeal?
[23:00:31] <bin> or that the revokation was valid within the existing framework of the law?
[23:00:38] <pussipupu> They didn't rule on her citizenship, which is what you keep claiming
[23:00:50] <pussipupu> So, I'm just going to ignore you on this like I have to on so much you
[23:01:01] <pussipupu> 're apparently deliberately ignorant on
[23:01:17] <twb> https://youtu.be/GNIYL5x1oy0  the government tried to ban criticism of the government unless it was purely for entertainment purposes (as opposed to, for example, criticism with the purpose of encouraging people to vote for someone else)
[23:01:18] <bin> I didn't say they did. I said they allowed her to repeal, but not via physical return.
[23:01:21] <bin> I said the court was involved
[23:01:38] <blkshp> can we give it a rest now please.
[23:01:48] <bin> pussipupu: the point was that the argument was that there's no system for appeal, but there is a system for appeal. that's the check/balance
[23:01:52] <blkshp> can we give it a rest now please.
[23:02:47] <twb> TV ads aren't allowed to lie in Australia – except for political ads.
