[03:04:58] <spiral> I already removed any queries that would lock the table for a long time, and if I try to run the query manually it completes in under a millisecond
[03:06:26] <peerce> when the query is hung, get its status from pg_stat_activity, and see what its hanging on, and if its waiting on a lock, you can look that lock up in pg_locks
[03:06:50] <peerce> locks are generally on a talbe or row basis, rather than column, btw.
[03:07:43] <spiral> i'm looking at pg_activity CLI tool and the queries are stuck on IO wait

[03:08:25] <spiral> also worth noting that queries to the same table on a different index do not get stuck like this one
[03:12:04] <peerce> IOwait means they are doing disk reads or writes and in the OS, hence shouldn't be stuck for very long at all unless your OS kernel's IO stack is all gummed up with way too many concurrently pending operations
[03:17:26] *** Quits: varioust (~varioust@gateway/tor-sasl/varioust) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:18:25] <peerce> its possible you'll see a lot of iowait if, for example, the query is doing a lot of disk reads, each iowait won't take that long but its doing them over and over.

[03:20:51] <spiral> ah I see
[03:21:27] <spiral> I am able to set apart enough RAM to store my entire database in cache minus one table, is there any way to tell postgres to not bother caching one table since it's rarely accessed?
[03:21:47] <peerce> we cosnidered our transactional (OLTP) servers to be well tuned when they did almost no disk read, and were almost entirely doing writes
[03:21:59] <spiral> gotcha
[03:22:39] <peerce> our databases were several terabytes, and the servers typically had 128-256GB, this was 5+ years ago
[03:23:50] <spiral> ah my database is really small (4-5GB) but get thousands of requests per second
[03:24:34] <peerce> what counts is the working set, how much of the data is being regularlly accessed.
[03:24:56] <peerce> we had 6 months of data in the database but most accesses were the last few days worth
[03:25:03] <peerce> lookups of older data were pretty rare
[03:25:24] <spiral> my access is pretty random unfortunately
[03:25:49] <peerce> well, 3-4GB  in ram should be easy.  even my phone has that kind of ram size
[03:26:02] <peerce> er, 4-5, whatever
[03:26:08] <spiral> i have one "logs" table that's 100GB or so and is barely accessed, so would be nice to tell the database to not cache that
[03:26:24] <peerce> if its not read, it won't be accessed

[03:27:10] <spiral> well, each row is read by our API immediately after a write
[03:27:56] <spiral> it is a bit of a weird setup, my service performs an action and logs it, an external integration notices that action and fetches the log
[03:28:21] <peerce> why not cache it as its being written and hand it off to whatever else needs it ?
[03:29:26] <spiral> i guess i could cache it myself to avoid reads, yeah
[03:29:58] <peerce> but anyways, reading a single or few rows shouldn't impact much cache
[03:30:06] <spiral> alright
[03:30:09] <peerce> especially if those rows just got written, they would already be in a buffer
[03:30:25] <peerce> since ALL blocks have to be processed in shared_buffers, thats just how it works
[03:30:35] <spiral> oh okay, i see

[05:40:46] <yetoo> why is this
[05:42:01] <peerce> databases have nothing to do with your file system directories

[05:50:49] *** Quits: tozhu (~tozhu@117.139.163.129) (Quit: tozhu)
[05:50:50] <peerce> the generalized answer is to create a new empty database, then import/restore the dump/backup
[05:51:17] <peerce> the specifics vary with how it was exported.
[05:51:27] <yetoo> peerce: I'm not sure, all I know is that there is a database directory with a bunch of .sql files supposedly created with postgres in a project I'm working on

[05:51:57] <peerce> pg_dump by default creates a single sql file of the entire database
[05:52:35] <peerce> but it has other options to create different formats, like -Fc for a 'custom' backup (compressed binary file containing total database), -Ft to create a 'tar' format dump, and -Fd to ccreate a 'directory' format dump
[05:52:56] <peerce> ask whomever made this backup what command(s) they used.
[05:53:13] <peerce> or what restore command they expect to be used.
[05:53:30] <peerce> psql is used to restore a .sql file, while pg_restore is for -Fc, -Fd, and -Ft format dumps
[05:54:00] <peerce> regardless, you have to create the new database before you can restore to it

[05:58:24] <peerce> the default is to dump the whole database as a single .sql file

[05:59:20] <yetoo> peerce: is thee a way to read the dump to have a hint which option was used
[05:59:37] <peerce> its a ascii text file, you can read it with more/less or a text editor such as vi

[06:00:41] <peerce> that would restore that single .sql file to that new database
[06:01:25] <peerce> but if the .sql has grants and such in it, then you probably need to restore it as a superuser, and have teh same roles(users) already defined.
[06:01:41] <peerce> again, ask the source for this backup.

[06:06:43] <peerce> to do that, both systems would need to be identical, with the exact same libc, and build and version of postgres, and the postgres server would need to be stopped before copying the $PGDATA directory, and that copy would contain ALL databases on that server
[06:07:15] <peerce> dumps can be imported across different builds, like linux vs windows

I'm just wondering if there is a standardish workflow such that these names are recognizable and that if the assertion of importing/loading the init would be done before the schema is imported/loaded
[07:16:40] <peerce> might as well ask, "I have a bunch of C source files, is there a standard workflow ?"
[07:17:14] <peerce> no, what you have was hand built, or maybe built by some toolkit, and it could be structured most any concievable way.
