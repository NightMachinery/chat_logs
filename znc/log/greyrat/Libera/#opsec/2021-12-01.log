[02:07:51] <ilikeyou> doesn't seem like the iz from freenode. different person?
[02:08:18] <iz> i'm the same iz
[02:09:16] <Joanna> This iz is more friendly!
[02:10:20] <Joanna> New improved iz
[02:10:34] <Joanna> Hi ilikeyou
[02:11:08] <iz> hehe, i think i'm equally friendly here, but diff channels make for diff mixes of ppl and diff situations
[02:13:59] <ilikeyou> nice to have ya around. super skilled. hi Joanna 
[02:22:05] <Joanna> I remember when iz and I used to have debates on freenode. And when he would get annoyed with irc and wander off to do something more productive:)
[02:22:57] <Joanna> We definitely need more smart active people here . The channel is often too quiet.
[02:29:14] <iz> yeah, that sounds about right for me :D
[02:31:31] <Joanna> It’s really strange how so many people couldn’t make it over here to libera and sign up.

[02:45:08] <s1gyn> Are they still on FN or just gone? I don't see any activity on FN pretty much
[02:47:13] <Joanna> s1gyn: I know one crazy person who refuses to leave  freenode. Nobody serious still goes there. It’s full of a lot of dead channels and lurkers.
[02:48:09] <Joanna> Some people are gone from both networks and gave up irc.
[02:48:46] <s1gyn> :(
[02:49:03] <s1gyn> https://freenode.net is now this reddit clone thing
[02:49:48] <Joanna> There is one person I know who is too lazy to come here and log in even after the staff helped him register. I talked to him almost everyday in irc for years.
[02:51:43] <Joanna> Wow that’s pretty useless website..
