[02:20:31] * gwern calls the gym and grrrs. everything *but* the weightroom is back open
[02:20:31] <kuudes> yeah, it is 6.7x
[02:21:23] <kuudes> galambo, basicly the math is yearly_factor^years = total_factor
[02:21:35] <Gurkenglas> hmm. from googling it sounds like such information costs hundreds of dollars. about a hundred dollars for the initial conversation. seems silly, shouldnt it just be some blogpost
[02:21:51] <kuudes> ask someone you trust and lives in germany?

[02:22:33] <Gurkenglas> i suppose i can try calling the bank or the tax office
[02:23:01] <kuudes> as said, do you have a friend who pays taxes you can ask who to ask from?
[02:23:32] <kuudes> I would hate us to get ufai just because you did not ask from a friend what to do re taxes
[02:23:36] <Gurkenglas> i never heard anyone talk about anything of the sort, but yeah probably i should just be asking someone who has ever earned money *in germany*
[02:23:42] <kuudes> yes
[02:24:18] <Gurkenglas> when i tried asking my mother she said she was just sorta bounced around bureaucratic institutions for a few months
[02:24:51] <kuudes> yes. which is likely it may be wise to pay that hundred or two for the work
[02:25:14] <kuudes> perhaps there are yearly contracts, where they would just fee you after the work based on your income or something
[02:25:46] <kuudes> over here I would recommend you to contact the tax office, but I don't know enough of other countries and my priors are not for it
[02:26:12] <galambo> so guys is it 50% or 32% or something else? or is the question just too poorly phrased?
[02:26:18] <kuudes> what
[02:26:24] <galambo> the annual rate
[02:26:32] <kuudes> didn't we already go through them?
[02:26:40] <galambo> what was the final answer sorry
[02:26:55] <kuudes> yearly_rate = exp(ln(total_rate)/years)
[02:27:19] <kuudes> total_rate = yearly_rate^years
[02:27:55] <galambo> is that 32%?

[02:28:15] <kuudes> I don't follow what parameters you are asking for anymore :) you said at something like 3 different param sets
[02:28:38] <kuudes> plug the numbers in the proper choice of those formulas and you see the result yourself
[02:28:43] <galambo> kuudes, I dont know how to interpret the prediction in this page: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7506/return-for-vgt-if-agi-arrives-by-2040/
[02:28:43] <Robomot> Return for VGT if AGI arrives by 2040 | Metaculus
[02:29:20] <galambo> fine thank you
[02:29:29] <galambo> I think its 32%
[02:29:45] <kuudes> yearly_rate = exp(ln(1870%)/(2040-2021.5))
[02:30:06] <galambo> ah 17%
[02:30:28] <kuudes> yes
[02:30:34] <kuudes> sounds low
[02:31:36] <kuudes> but yeah, bad prediction per comments
[02:31:40] <kuudes> not well defined
[02:31:42] <galambo> it was like 15% before. its trending upwards
[02:31:51] <kuudes> if it takes the dividends out in midway and does not reinvest them
[02:32:04] <kuudes> so I guess they then gain 0% after splitting off the stock
[02:32:18] <kuudes> which is a very weird way to think of things imo
[02:32:19] <Gurkenglas> surely it's fallacious to convert it into a yearly rate like that. this geometric average would after all be far above economic growth today and far below economic growth then
[02:32:31] <galambo> also its inflation adjustment
[02:32:35] <galambo> adjusted
[02:32:55] <galambo> probably closer to 20something percent
[02:33:08] <gwern> Gurkenglas: it's useful to help ballpark your estimate. if nothing else, don't you want to know what 'absolutely nothing unusual happens and 7% growth happens like clockwork' translates into in this made-up new endpoint?
[02:33:36] <gwern> is that '50' '100' '1000' '10,000' or what? 'uhhh...' exactly
[02:33:44] <galambo> gwern, yes thats a good point
[02:34:17] <shawwwn> VGT
[02:34:19] <Gurkenglas> i suppose finding ludicrous returns is a necessary condition for paying attention :)
[02:34:32] <shawwwn> wouldn't it be ironic if attention was the key for AGI
[02:34:39] <shawwwn> then you can say that you were paying attention when you win
[02:35:15] <Gurkenglas> (assuming no distortionary effects from worlds where money ceases to matter)
[02:35:43] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, I presume gwern was aiming to talk to galambo and made a tab-complete mistake
[02:35:54] <Gurkenglas> contra
[02:35:59] <kuudes> oh, true
[02:36:02] <kuudes> my bad, sorry
[02:36:16] <kuudes> I missed that line of yours
[02:36:45] <kuudes> inflation adjusted... by what measure then?
[02:36:54] <kuudes> "#¤"#%¤ very badly defined prediction.
[02:37:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Oh I guess I haven't looked at it very recently?
[02:37:05] * Obormot\Arcturus looks
[02:37:20] <galambo> not better than bitcoin's 200%
[02:37:23] <kuudes> if it is index, then it should just be measured in its raw index point number
[02:37:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh no it's definitely better
[02:37:42] <galambo> kuudes, but what about inflation?
[02:37:47] <kuudes> nothing
[02:37:59] <kuudes> inflation is not relevant to equity values
[02:38:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> They abandoned that ridiculous narrow font, the nonsensical visual design where everything is undifferentiated thin lines regardless of whether it's content or empty styling...
[02:38:18] <kuudes> you are not measuring how many cans of peanut butter your today investment will buy you in 20 years
[02:38:22] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, I wish there was a way to force the old design. it was bootiful
[02:38:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whe "Welcome to Metaculus" screen still popups up repeatedly -_-
[02:38:27] * shawwwn twirls Obormot's mustache 
[02:38:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: And yet non-functional and indeed actively detrimental to functioning
[02:38:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> The new one is very generic, I grant
[02:39:10] <gwern> old metaculus was very esthetic in its particular cyberpunk dark mode way, but not functional
[02:39:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they also switched the front page to an unadorned "feed" view which is much less appropriate to the content than what they had
[02:39:14] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, I dont know. I prefer the old one

[02:39:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Font choices in the new one are terrible
[02:40:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not as terrible as the old one, and for a different reason
[02:40:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Regrettably, it seems that no one on their team has any taste or knows what they're doing, design-wise
[02:40:50] <shawwwn> the aesthetic of the old esthetic was very eclectic in its ethos
[02:40:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course they have the two-state dark mode toggle...
[02:40:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> No one gets this shit right -_-
[02:41:17] <gwern> shawwwn: that was part of what made it esthetic

[02:42:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, Moldbug really hated circling, didn't he

[02:43:57] <galambo> saturn2, yay
[02:44:43] <Gurkenglas> suppose a market with two tradables: A doubles every year, B goes beyond the pale in 2050. everyone starts in 2000 with the same money; by 2020 most of the money is on holders of A.

[02:45:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, reading https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/well/mind/mental-health-day-laws-kids.html and also thinking about that homeschooling thread on DSL
[02:45:08] <Robomot> Why Teens Are Advocating for Mental Health Days Off School - The New York Times (The decline in the mental health of children and adolescents has led to new laws allowing kids to attend to their own self-care.)
[02:45:40] <gwern> hey, if it lets them opt out of school while not falling too hard behind in the college-admissions victimization olympics, go for it
[02:45:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was thinking about how I'd improve on my high school educational experience, if given the chance. And I realized there was a dead-simple way to do it, one that would keep everything good about it while also solving all problems
[02:46:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ready? Here's the brilliant plan: remove all non-STEM classes
[02:46:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Replace them with nothing
[02:46:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just free time
[02:46:32] <Gurkenglas> (and kill the ai class with fire i suppose :P)
[02:46:53] <kuudes> I liked history classes
[02:46:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Keep all the math, "tech", CS, science, etc.
[02:47:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe have, like, 4-5 semesters' worth of humanities electives (choosable from the Social Studies / English / languages departments), takeable at any time; forbid the teachers therein to assign any homework
[02:48:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Otherwise, yeah, just shorten the school day
[02:48:12] <kuudes> usa has a lot of homework, I hear
[02:48:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[02:48:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I didn't mind my math/etc. homework in high school
[02:48:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> The social studies and English and so on homework was 99% useless shit busywork at all times
[02:48:49] <kuudes> I liked the thing in ects reform that the faculty had actually budget the student workhours of each course
[02:48:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yeah, just dump the whole thing
[02:49:05] <Gurkenglas> what would they have done if you had refused to participate in the busywork?
[02:49:09] <kuudes> so that they were actually doable in the prescribed workhour amount
[02:49:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And like, Art Appreciation? Music Appreciation? Directly into the trash
[02:49:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Uhh failed me obviously
[02:49:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> WHat kinda question is that
[02:49:36] <Gurkenglas> they would have had you repeat the class until you stop refusing to participate?
[02:49:44] <kuudes> what's it, 60 ects = 1600 hours, so 1 ects ~ 27 hours?
[02:49:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Yyyyes? Of course?
[02:50:00] <kuudes> including homework and assignments and reading to exam etc
[02:50:50] <kuudes> wasn't it that in usa people basicly don't fail?
[02:50:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[02:51:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I definitely saw some kids fail classes.
[02:51:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heck, I almost failed one
[02:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Only passed because my teacher took pity on me because he was a nice guy
[02:51:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Music Appreciation. Final exam was to identify famous pieces of classical music by hearing them
[02:51:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> No way I was passing that test
[02:51:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Got like a 35/100 or something
[02:53:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I'd gotten into the other music teachers' class, the hardass bitch teacher instead of the nice dude teacher, I'd be repeating that shit to this day probably
[02:53:23] <Gurkenglas> was there the option to drop out of high school but keep sitting in on stem classes?
[02:53:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol no
[02:53:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are you kidding
[02:54:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "keep sitting in" - do you know how much money these schools get from the city? They're not gonna let random assholes so much as get into the building without being enrolled
[02:55:57] *** Joins: galambo_ (galambo@user/galambo)
[02:56:24] <kuudes> it is interesting that over here teaching is technically public, and without a due reason you can't prevent random people coming to observe class
[02:56:43] <Gurkenglas> ah. in germany you just go into the college and you sit down in the lecture hall. paying money gets you a public transport ticket and you can do exams and get a piece of paper at the end. possibly school was similarly horrific?
[02:56:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, bottom line, my plan fixes everything. Stress from having to spend long school days followed by long hours of homework? Gone. Wasting time on useless bullshit taught by incompetents (because most of the humanities dept teachers there were idiots, unlike the STEM dept teachers)? Gone.
[02:57:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sleep deprivation? Gone.
[02:57:30] <Gurkenglas> were there people in the useless classes that enjoyed them more than the stem classes?
[02:57:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not being able to spend time on proper understanding of the important subjects because you need to read some nonsense literature assignment and write an essay? Gone.
[02:58:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Probably, we had all sorts of weirdoes, but so what? It was a science and tech school! Explicitly!
[02:58:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyone who wasn't there for the science and the tech doesn't matter
[02:59:37] <Gurkenglas> sleep deprivation doesnt count, i read you can just shift the schoolday forward and that fixes it.
[02:59:40] *** Quits: galambo (~galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:02:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, is that right? So you shift the school day forward two hours, yeah? Start at 10:00 AM. Finish at 7:00 AM. Home at 8:00. Undress, eat, shower, other mundane needs - done at 9:00. Homework until 2:00 AM. Sleep until 8:30. Leave house at 9:00. Start over...
[03:03:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> 6.5 hours of sleep for a teenager, you think that won't make people sleep-deprived just because you shifted it forward a bit?
[03:03:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> And god forbid anything takes you longer than I just outlined - even less sleep time!
[03:03:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> *finish at 7:00 PM, I obviously meant
[03:04:23] <Gurkenglas> uhh i think the 5 hours of homework are higher priority to delete
[03:04:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> You don't say -_-
[03:04:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> But guess what, if you cut out half the classes, you cut out half the homework!
[03:05:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Possibly more, because humanities classes tended to assign more homework)
[03:05:45] <Gurkenglas> so school was not similarly horrific, because as a kid i had time to do things.
[03:06:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is why my plan is so perfect and clever
[03:06:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just delete half of the stuff that filled our time
[03:08:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile - https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/articles/the-death-of-behavioral-economics - the part about only large losses being truly aversive, those that can *wipe you out* ... aha! I've made this point before! I was right!
[03:08:52] <Robomot> The death of behavioral economics  - Jason Hreha (I've got some bad news.  Behavioral economics is dead.  Yes, it's still being taught. Yes, it's still being researched by academics around the world. Yes, it's still being used by practitioners and government officials across the globe.  It sure does look alive... but it's a zombie—inside and out.)
[03:09:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Well, actually, it looks like Kahneman and Tversky, winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, knew about this unfortunate fact when they were developing Prospect Theory—their grand theory with loss aversion at its center. Unfortunately, the findings rebutting their view of loss aversion were carefully omitted from their papers, and other findings that went against their model were misrepresented so that they would instead
[03:09:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  support their pet theory. In short: any data that didn't fit Prospect Theory was dismissed or distorted.
[03:09:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know what you'd call this behavior... but it's not science." ... oh no :(
[03:11:03] <Gurkenglas> at this rate it'll turn out the heuristics and biases stuff was just bias and actually we're all perfectly sane
[03:12:36] <kuudes> 10-7 sounds a lot
[03:12:42] <kuudes> 9 hours of school per day
[03:12:56] <kuudes> what age?
[03:13:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> High school
[03:13:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, ~14-18, typically
[03:13:13] <kuudes> thanks
[03:13:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was a bit younger because I'd skipped a grade or two
[03:13:18] <kuudes> how is that legal?
[03:13:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Legal? Why shouldn't it be?
[03:13:34] <kuudes> too many hours
[03:13:42] <kuudes> like, work is not allowed to be that long
[03:13:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... it's not?
[03:13:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Since when
[03:14:04] <kuudes> yes, it is criminal to work your people that long consistently
[03:14:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uhhh
[03:14:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> No such laws exist here
[03:14:15] <kuudes> indeed
[03:14:35] <kuudes> eu has all these weird protection things. uk government disliked them so much :-p
[03:14:37] <adiabatic> nobody tell kuudes about the compulsory sports I had in high school on top of all my schoolwork
[03:14:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, there were eight class "periods" in our school day
[03:14:49] <Gurkenglas> (transit too long too; here it was ~15x2 minutes)
[03:14:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Each was 45 minutes long, with 5 minutes for going from class to class
[03:15:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Period 1 through 8
[03:15:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then of course there was period 0, and period 9

[03:15:55] <kuudes> yeah. there is a reason why usa has, what, 2000 work hours per year and finland 1600-1700

[03:16:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Well, as for the transit, that's what you get in a big city
[03:16:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> And a magnet school
[03:16:36] <Gurkenglas> ...im in the biggest city in germany
[03:16:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh-huh, and how big is said city exactly
[03:17:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> According to the interwebs, Berlin has 3.5m people
[03:17:19] <Gurkenglas> 891km², 3.6mil people
[03:17:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's less than half NYC's population
[03:17:49] <kuudes> sure, but isn't nyc the most populous city in the world?
[03:17:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nnno
[03:17:59] <kuudes> what has more? tokyo?
[03:18:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think so yeah
[03:18:24] <Gurkenglas> ...nyc has less area than berlin.
[03:18:29] <kuudes> moscow has what, 10M? and st petersburg 5m

[03:20:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Anyway the key point is that it was a magnet school; if I'd gone to a local high school in my school district, my commute would've been much shorter, of course
[03:21:10] <Gurkenglas> also it should be more due to the density of the city, not the size. one school per x people. maybe you go further if you go to a specialized school. my second school was chosen for its gifted program. ive often beaten myself up for not going to *the* math school in berlin, i think that would have been 60 minutes each way
[03:21:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I had to get on the subway and ride all the way to Lower Manhattan, which is a solid 45 minutes of just the train ride, never mind the walk to/from the station

[08:42:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I wanted I could have a Quicksilver action for it and then it'd just be Cmt-Space, type ... but it's simple enough as it is
[08:42:28] <adiabatty> having Alfred handle that kind of thing is easy enough
[08:44:31] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: type? I highlight a selection
[08:44:55] <gwern> typing out whole phrases is for chumps. I could be using those seconds to be skimming snippets!
[08:45:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I can do that too but not in my IRC client
[08:45:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Because Snak is Carbon, not Cocoa, so no access to Services
[08:45:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I just highlight, Cmd-C, Cmd-Tab, Cmt-T, Cmd-V, return
[08:46:05] <adiabatty> wow, that's awful. if you're going to put up with no Services you might as well run an Electron app
[08:46:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> What? No
[08:46:15] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: surely there's a commandline or alternative route to the selection? like if I didn't have selection stuff built into xmonad, I'd just use xclip
[08:46:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> er, what would commandline do
[08:46:41] <gwern> pull the selection from the WM somehow
[08:46:44] <adiabatty> "no services" is probably my biggest complaint about the Electron apps I run
[08:47:21] <adiabatty> gwern: you mean let A PROGRAM find out what you've got selected? That could possibly send the selection to a server and snoop on you?
[08:47:34] <adiabatty> ABSOLUTELY HARMA
[08:47:39] <gwern> (this is actually how it worked with assange's surfraw lo a decade+ ago - surfraws were shell scripts, so to run the google surfraw with the x selection buffer instead of manually, it was just 'xclip -o | surfraw google' or whatever the exact syntax was)
[08:47:39] * adiabatty coughs
[08:47:43] <adiabatty> ABSOLUTELY HARAM
[08:48:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: You gotta copy it into the clipboard before there's system access to it... I guess I could set up a Quicksilver action, or perhaps create a system-wide Service via Automator, that takes the current clipboard contents and googles it
[08:48:07] <gwern> adiabatty: well, apple is already snooping on every damn program you run and sending off hashes for fingerprinting and god knows what else
[08:48:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that keystroke sequence is reflex now
[08:48:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah you know what, now that we're actually talking about it, I am curious
[08:49:04] <adiabatty> me, I usually end up typing opt-space and type "safa" when I could just type the query in Alfred
[08:49:08] <adiabatty> but I"m a simple man
[08:49:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm
[08:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Actually maybe I *can* access the selection via Services from Snak ...
[08:49:41] * gwern likes to say that the surfraw for ratpoison, then the stumpwm, then the xmonad impls, are probably the most useful programming he's ever done in terms of saving himself & others time/effort
[08:50:24] <gwern> (because, damn, I use those things dozens of times a day and have for like 16 years now)
[08:51:47] <adiabatty> one of my big time savers was having date generators in TextExpander because it's nice to have the date and time with a little typing and no looking up
[08:52:28] <adiabatty> especially when I'm comically slow at looking at the date/time thingy and seeing "Aug" and translating that into "08"
[08:52:36] <adiabatty> even slower if I couldn't count on my fingers
[09:00:37] <shawwwn> adiabatty: is your name related to /dev/tty?
[09:01:33] <shawwwn> because you're a tty
[09:06:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bah

[14:45:19] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "A business could be considered highly cash-intensive if (a) it operates mainly on cash-transaction basis; (b) its assets consist mostly of cash or liquid (current) assets.42 Bars, restaurants, retail trade shops, supermarkets, car washes and betting/gambling businesses (such as casinos) usually receive most payments by clients in cash, and this could be helpful for laundering purposes. It would be easier to justify extra 
[14:45:19] <two2thehead> (illicit) proceeds as legitimate revenues and it would be possible to deposit large volumes of cash as daily earnings on companies’s bank accounts, thus easing the placement of illicit funds into the financial circuit"
[14:45:19] <two2thehead> Not surprisingly, recent studies show that cash-intensive sectors are usually preferred by organised crime infiltrating legal businesses. For example, in Italy,wholesale and retail trade, bars, restaurants, hotels and construction represent more than 70% of the approximately 2,000 companies confiscated from mafia groups in the last 30 years (chart below). Confiscated betting agencies and video-lottery/slot machine businesses, despite being low in 
[14:45:23] <two2thehead> number, weigh relatively high when compared to their numbers in the legal economy"
[14:46:44] <two2thehead> "A more recent report concludes that these sectors are associated with the high-est estimated money laundering risk in the country.45 Clients seldom pay cash for construction contracts but, at least in Italy, construction is the sector with the most liquid assets (about 70% of average total assets of Italian building companies is held in cash, inventory, receivables and other current assets). It would be rational for criminals to want their 
[14:46:45] <two2thehead> businesses to stay liquid in order to ease a quick selling-off should they feel themselves to be under investigation or at risk of seizure and confiscation. In any case, the construction industry—along with bars, restaurants and agriculture—is also the sector with the high-est prevalence of irregular workers, who may become another way to launder illicit proceeds—through the distribution of black salaries paid in cash and further spe
[14:46:45] <two2thehead> nt by workers in the legitimate economy"
[14:47:48] <two2thehead> Ah, that answers my earlier question. Were the categories of bars, restaurants, pubs and hotels selected purely for social signaling?
[14:48:09] <two2thehead> tl;dr criminals apparently want to vertically integrate their business whenever possible
[15:03:37] <nshepperd> i thought it was obvious that the restaurants etc were chosen for money laundering purposes

[16:03:30] <Gurkenglas> The actual deadlock is just that the CenterEffectiveAltruism form asks for a breakdown of expenses and I have no idea how much money will go into all manner of taxes and insurances and whoever else waits to knock at my door until I have money. What's the usual way to figure that out? Tax software would seem to only cover a part.
[16:04:14] <Gurkenglas> Or is the proper approach to write basically that paragraph into the expenses breakdown? :) perhaps with my decision process on how to allocate whatever money doesn't magically vanish

[16:16:54] <feep[work]> I mean, you're asking for funding, just write "projected taxes" and guess it
[16:17:03] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: that's great to hear, mate
[16:17:28] <feep[work]> like, do some math on it but don't go crazy trying to be percent accurate, I'd say
[16:18:35] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: I think the standard way to tax it is to like, declare it as income from labor, so just use an income tax calculator
[16:18:50] <feep[work]> I think the fact that you're being funded from outside the eu doesn't matter
[16:21:58] <feep[work]> remember that if you're working from home, your living room is your office and you can discount a fraction of the rent as work expenditure
[16:22:25] <feep[work]> also your internet tariff :)
[16:23:14] <feep[work]> ie. take the area of your living room, divide by total area, that's the fraction of rent and utilities you can discount
[16:23:47] <feep[work]> elster should have guides for all of this
[16:24:48] <Gurkenglas> yeah the reason i didnt just go for the tax software is that i dont expect them to include, like, insurance or whatever

[16:25:27] <Gurkenglas> just short elsevier
[16:26:57] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: I think you want elster fragebogen einzelunternehmen
[16:27:34] <feep[work]> hm, maybe not. hm
[16:28:33] <feep[work]> software development is recognized as a freelancer occupation
[16:28:59] <Gurkenglas> does it matter if the results go to the public domain?
[16:29:02] <feep[work]> no
[16:29:34] <PapuaHardyNet> dbohdan: aww. But I hate Elsevier and want to fund anyone and everyone who works to destroy their monopoly
[16:29:38] <feep[work]> yeah I think this is still einzelunternehmen, einzelunternehmen includes freelancer
[16:29:44] <feep[work]> ie. freiberufler
[16:30:01] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, the stock market is an assassination market for companies. what more do you need
[16:30:11] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: um, is this a software job? I assumed..
[16:30:27] <feep[work]> what are you actually doing XD
[16:30:47] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], yeah long term future funds gives me 12000€ to write a pytorch library to analyze a given network
[16:30:55] <feep[work]> yeah that's freiberufler, ez
[16:31:32] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: was that sarcasm? If not, that's really sweet
[16:31:43] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: are you still working regular hours in the meantime?
[16:32:01] <Gurkenglas> never really worked, hence i dont know who wants money
[16:32:08] <feep[work]> okay that makes it easier
[16:32:33] <PapuaHardyNet> re: stockmarket, I have no access to NYSE. I do have access to XMR and can build and maintain infrastructure, and am willing to work toward ensuring places like scihub stay afloat
[16:32:43] <feep[work]> yeah just register as self-employed, that gets you a tax number you can use for expenses
[16:33:09] <feep[work]> (probably not gonna have any)
[16:33:13] <feep[work]> (maybe a new computer)
[16:33:27] <feep[work]> then you just do your taxes as regular year over year
[16:33:55] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: srsly just google it freiberufler steuern this is all well documented
[16:34:18] <Gurkenglas> i do in fact expect to post bounties on like eleutherai to produce some plot or another

[16:35:29] <feep[work]> hm
[16:35:30] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: I'd love to read your submissions, if you are willing to share them. I'm curious about what you are working on
[16:35:31] <feep[work]> hang on
[16:36:17] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: I *think* you can actually ignore all this
[16:38:05] <feep[work]> well it doesn't matter since you aren't selling goods
[16:39:30] <feep[work]> hmhm. okay, I think you are above the level where you do need to register as a freelancer at least.
[16:39:43] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: what's the time period for those €12k?
[16:39:52] <Gurkenglas> 3 months

[18:07:21] <feep[work]> https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/179175/HKU-study-warns-against-accidental-vaccination-into-veins huh.
[18:07:23] <Robomot> HKU study warns against accidental vaccination into veins  | The Standard (Accidental intravenous injections of BioNTech jabs may cause heart muscle inflammation, research conducted by the University of Hong Kong ha...)
[18:08:00] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, there's a chicken and egg problem of emotional investment - two people, say, act aloof to each other because no one wants to risk rejection
[18:08:19] <PapuaHardyNet> Sure, it is uncommon in many circles, especially rationalist circles
[18:09:01] <feep[work]> tl;dr usually they check that they didn't accidentally jab a vein, but for covid vaccines they said you don't have to do that, and that might have led to accidental intravenous injections causing the heart issues
[18:09:21] <PapuaHardyNet> but I'm very curious about this entire phenomenon. I actually built an entire framework of thought regarding emotional investment a few years ago, but looking back at it, it still feels incomplete
[18:10:58] <PapuaHardyNet> my favorite "solution" to the "chicken and egg" problem was a schizophrenic increase and decrease of investment to make the other person show their cards. I think that's actually a strategy some women follow unconsciously
[18:11:22] <PapuaHardyNet> (all this is in the context of dating and romance, in case it wasn't clear)
[18:16:11] <kuudes> hmm, so that would explain those heart inflammation cases?

Anyway this reminds me of a great anecdote in Gregory Zuckerman’s book about Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies, “The Man Who Solved the Market.” The story is about Renaissance executive (now chief executive officer) Peter Brown:   'Once, as he
[22:15:00] <feepbot> worked on a complicated project late in the evening, full of manic energy despite the hour, Brown picked up the phone to call a junior associate at home with a pressing question. A colleague stopped Brown before he could dial. “Peter, you can’t call him,” he said. “It’s two a.m.” Brown looked confused, forcing the colleague to explain himself. “He doesn’t get paid
[22:15:00] <feepbot> enough to answer questions at two a.m.” “Fine, let’s give him a raise, then,” Brown replied. “But we have to call him!”'    For a lucrative enough business, the answer to “they don’t get paid enough to work this hard” is always going to be “well let's pay them more.”' https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-24/hedge-funds-want-to-stay-popular
