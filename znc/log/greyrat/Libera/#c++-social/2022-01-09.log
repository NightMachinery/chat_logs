[01:32:23] <ERROH> friend was saying i can't be watching the new spiderman wihtout watching whatever movie was earlier
[01:32:33] <ERROH> like, there's no dependency resolver for movies
[01:33:19] <ERROH> you can't be watching RAMBO 4 without having first watching RAMBO 3 and gone with the wolfs
[01:33:34] <ERROH> and like you have a passport with movies you've seen
[01:33:47] <ERROH> didn't see the dep?  can't watch the new thing
[01:37:27] <T`alZHeimeR> 100M agree with your friend
[01:37:34] <T`alZHeimeR> s/M/%/
[01:38:01] <T`alZHeimeR> i started watching battlestar galactica with the originals from the 70s
[01:38:03] <dukwon> what about prequels?
[01:38:05] <T`alZHeimeR> so painful
[01:38:10] <T`alZHeimeR> so not worth it
[01:38:15] <dukwon> do you have to watch in release order or story order?
[01:38:24] <T`alZHeimeR> will still do it again though
[01:38:37] <T`alZHeimeR> nah prequels can be seen after
[01:38:43] <T`alZHeimeR> release order
[01:39:00] <BIRDSORTING> haha
[01:39:04] <BIRDSORTING> no dependency resolver for movies
[01:39:17] <BIRDSORTING> number of times i've googled what order to watch fucking dumb fantasy crap in
[01:39:25] <T`alZHeimeR> you suck at movies, please handover your 4K tv
[01:42:52] <T`alZHeimeR> I got bit by an insect yesterday, it still itches like crazy today
[01:43:07] <T`alZHeimeR> REAL LIFE, not even once
[01:44:18] <BIRDSORTING> :<
[01:44:28] <BIRDSORTING> in germany i went to read in the palace gardens in munch
[01:44:31] <BIRDSORTING> found a nice grassy spot
[01:44:35] <BIRDSORTING> pulled my bike up
[01:44:38] <BIRDSORTING> laid down
[01:44:42] <BIRDSORTING> after about 10 minutes my back started burning
[01:44:47] <BIRDSORTING> sat up, reached behind
[01:44:50] *** Joins: Zogatribe (Zogatribe@user/zogatribe)
[01:44:55] <BIRDSORTING> and my hand was covered in red ants
[01:45:00] <BIRDSORTING> so i lept up tore my clothes off
[01:45:02] <BIRDSORTING> shook everything
[01:45:05] <BIRDSORTING> like a mad cunt
[01:45:07] <T`alZHeimeR> ho shit
[01:45:09] <BIRDSORTING> got back on my bike and fled
[01:45:14] <BIRDSORTING> in nz we have nothing dangerous
[01:45:18] <BIRDSORTING> we have one very rare spider
[01:45:22] <BIRDSORTING> that no one ever gets bitten by
[01:45:29] <BIRDSORTING> but no other dangerous creatures at all
[01:46:00] <T`alZHeimeR> i call bs. I've seen the internet. I've seen your giant insects. not going there ever
[01:46:12] <BIRDSORTING> you mean australia
[01:46:18] <BIRDSORTING> nz has an entirely different ecosystem
[01:46:23] <T`alZHeimeR> a spider larger than 5cm cant be non lethal !
[01:46:26] <BIRDSORTING> cause we only had birds until europeans came (basically)
[01:46:30] <BIRDSORTING> yeah that's australia
[01:46:35] <BIRDSORTING> the birds ate all the insects
[01:46:54] <T`alZHeimeR> ha yes, australia, nz, same no ?
[01:46:55] <BIRDSORTING> cause there were no mammals for most of the history of nz
[01:47:04] <BIRDSORTING> naah australia is a very very very strange genetic place
[01:47:13] <BIRDSORTING> nz is just birds, some shit arse insects, and boring flowers
[01:47:20] <BIRDSORTING> cause no insects = no interesting flowers
[01:47:29] <BIRDSORTING> i was amazed at the wild flowers in netherlands and germany
[01:47:31] <BIRDSORTING> it's very pretty
[01:47:33] <BIRDSORTING> we have none of that
[01:48:38] <T`alZHeimeR> once doing camping, some ants colony decided to raid our tent to find $something
[01:48:54] <T`alZHeimeR> could not sleep for 2 days, those fuckers keep bitting you all night long
[01:49:05] <BIRDSORTING> yeah i went camping in romania
[01:49:10] <BIRDSORTING> in the countryside in the middle of nowhere
[01:49:15] <BIRDSORTING> and they were drinking home made plum wine
[01:49:19] <BIRDSORTING> i got very drunk, passed out
[01:49:24] <BIRDSORTING> woke up being bitten by what looked like wasps
[01:49:30] <BIRDSORTING> massive yellow and black flies
[01:49:33] <BIRDSORTING> freaked me the fuck out
[01:49:38] <BIRDSORTING> had heaps of bites
[01:49:45] <BIRDSORTING> they were literally just eating me alive
[01:50:43] <T`alZHeimeR> insects in europe are 99% not dangerous though, except when it is
[01:50:56] <T`alZHeimeR> i ean, they will bite you, but not kill you
[01:51:09] <BIRDSORTING> yeah i wasn't that worried
[01:51:13] <BIRDSORTING> i've lived in vietnam for a bit
[01:51:18] <BIRDSORTING> and i was a lot more concerned about shit there
[01:51:21] <BIRDSORTING> haha
[01:52:24] <T`alZHeimeR> mabe it was hornet ?
[01:52:40] <BIRDSORTING> we have those here
[01:52:42] <T`alZHeimeR> not that common here, but they exist, and are painful, avoid them
[01:52:51] <BIRDSORTING> i've been stung super badly a few times by wasps and once by hornets
[01:53:01] <BIRDSORTING> these hornets killed our goat when i was a kid
[01:53:05] <BIRDSORTING> and i tried to get the goat away
[01:53:07] <BIRDSORTING> and then dad came
[01:53:11] <BIRDSORTING> and we all got absolutely stung
[01:53:13] <BIRDSORTING> and the goat died
[01:53:17] <T`alZHeimeR> :(
[01:53:17] <BIRDSORTING> was fucking quite bad
[01:56:48] <Zogatribe> BIRDSORTING: your nick is a bit shouty
[01:57:06] <BIRDSORTING> great Zogatribe 
[01:57:08] <BIRDSORTING> maybe you can fuck off
