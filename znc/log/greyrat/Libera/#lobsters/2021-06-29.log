[00:35:54] <companion_cube> "would you rather not have ads relevant to you?"
[00:36:34] <kline> perhaps, but lobsters is probably not the place to discuss this
[00:37:19] <kline> perhaps it would be less obviously off-topic if it was a submission that covered more than just "the norwegians are on record saying surveillance bad"
[00:38:01] <indigo> I mean, everyone should listen to the Norwegians
[00:38:11] <indigo> They're very efficient
[00:38:19] <indigo> All of their Navy ships have barcodes on them
[00:38:43] <hoistbypetard> And unlike Finland, their country exists

[12:10:18] <frankfurt> If Richard Stallman never existed, would there be such a thing as Free Software Movement? Would we all be writing closed source software without him? Would the concept of open source software be considered a "sounds good, doesn't work" without him? Since I was not alive at the time, I'm interested in the history of the time from a first-person perspective. Many books or articles today would obviously
[12:10:24] <frankfurt> be biased. I'm looking for a first or second hand narrative. This is a purely historical question. I'm not looking to debate.
[12:11:26] <riv> frankfurt, yeah
[12:11:29] <martian67> alternate history stuff is essentially unanswerable
[12:11:53] <wink> it's not liek he invented the concept, just popularized and formulized
[12:12:04] <wink> if you want to conflate open source and the free software movement
[12:12:15] *** Joins: varjag (~user@188.95.247.249)
[12:12:16] <wink> I'd imagine something similar would have happened with other people
[12:12:18] <riv> i would just be windows and mac, and linux would be on equal footing with stuff like plan9 and templeos in terms of practical usability
[12:12:36] <xcombelle> there would not copyleft I bet, everything would be BSD or similar, or proprietary
[12:12:42] <martian67> I don't think either supposition is supportable
[12:12:45] *** Joins: mercerist (~mercerist@user/mercerist)
[12:12:55] <xcombelle> emacs and gcc would not exist
[12:12:56] <martian67> BSD licensing was explicitly inspired by the GNU GPL
[12:13:03] <frankfurt> wink: I'm asking if we vanish Richard Stallman from history, were there other currents and schools which would have given rise to the popularisation of open source?
[12:13:11] <martian67> it was quite restrictively licensed beforehand
[12:13:17] <martian67> due to AT&T stuff
[12:13:18] <rtpg> One might look at right now and say "wow there was just one RMS" but there might only really only need to be one of these kinds of people, and in the absense of it then one would appear
[12:13:29] <frankfurt> rtpg: Exactly.
[12:13:31] <xcombelle> and probably computer would be years behind now
[12:13:33] <riv> rtpg, like mold
[12:13:42] <rtpg> :)
[12:13:53] <wink> frankfurt: that's what nobody knows. but the concept of making things available to others for free isn't new.
[12:14:14] <riv> i have to say i think we are very very lucky that we have fully free operating systems today that can do things like browse the web
[12:14:23] <riv> and this could have easily not happened
[12:14:29] <martian67> a question like that is like "what if hitler never existed" you essentially cannot answer it with any rigour
[12:14:32] <rtpg> I mean seriously though there's a lot of stuff that feels unique and it's mostly that people who otherwise would try to start from scratch would instead bolt onto something that already exists, and it's probably mostly random who ends up being the "leader" of such movements (though obviously the effects downstream can be different depending on the person)
[12:14:44] <martian67> its like reading tea leaves
[12:14:48] <frankfurt> rtpg: But it stills seems unbelievable that one man is responsible for changing the history. I feel deep down that history is too-biased towards hero-worship.
[12:14:51] <riv> oh we reached hitler already
[12:15:03] <riv> that was a quick one
[12:15:07] <wink> martian67: yeah. but as Hitler wasn't involved in WW1 we could reasonably assume there might have been a WW2 without him
[12:15:26] <martian67> maybe, maybe not
[12:15:30] <varjag> v.v.v
[12:15:30] <mockturtle> (\/)_!_!_(\/)
[12:15:32] <wink> exactly.
[12:15:34] <martian67> serious historians avoid speculation like that
[12:15:53] <wink> I'm just saying "it's not outrageous to imagine X or Y"
[12:15:59] <rtpg> It's not like Hitler was directly involved in like... Mousilini, Imperial Japan, etc etc etc at first
[12:16:07] <frankfurt> wink: The question is whether the idea was waiting to happen or if the person literally gave birth to the circumstances. Hitler or Stallman. Stalin or Mao. That question is important.
[12:16:11] <Ticho> we (or at least some countries) may still very well end up with unauthorized computing devices not legally allowed - either on the internet, or in use at all
[12:16:15] <rtpg> "maybe maybe not" is like... very dismissive of all the other stuff
[12:16:16] <xcombelle> why being serious? dystopia is a thing ?
[12:16:43] <wink> frankfurt: yes, and to my knowledge the overall mood (esp in germany) greatly made the outcome likely
[12:17:42] <frankfurt> wink: People suggest that Richard Stallman copied a whole lot of GNU Emacs code from James Gosling's Gosling Emacs. Did he write the whole of GNU/Linux by himself, except the kernel?
[12:18:33] <wink> Ticho: back in the 80s you weren't allowed to use your own modem here (I think it was an actual law), only the official ones

[12:20:23] <varjag> before people started to contribute
[12:20:38] <varjag> but people started to contribute before linux was even on the horizon of course
[12:20:41] <wink> rewrote in that regard, to be fair though?
[12:21:01] <wink> I mean the userspace had the same functionality as the BSDs, I guess?
[12:21:07] <varjag> wink: i don't think my point was that he invented unix
[12:21:21] <wink> varjag: I know, but I think it's an important distinction
[12:21:24] <varjag> he wrote gnu utils from the scratch
[12:21:28] <frankfurt> varjag: Many coreutils were written by volunteers, right?
[12:21:29] <varjag> not rewrote existing gnu
[12:21:45] <wink> a clean room implementation of a *nix userspace
[12:21:52] <riv> thing is the actual quality of GNU software is abysmal and could easily have been written better
[12:22:01] <varjag> yeah
[12:22:03] <varjag> bsd sucked too
[12:22:09] <riv> it's the social factors that mattered, somehow, stallman got people to actually use it and follow him
[12:22:10] <varjag> i mean it still sucks
[12:22:12] <martian67> thats not really true riv
[12:22:35] <frankfurt> riv: I think they were aiming to avoid copyright claims, so they had to write *different* code compared to Unix.
[12:22:43] <varjag> conceptually the whole unix thing is not something elegant
[12:22:52] <frankfurt> varjag: Certainly.
[12:22:54] <varjag> desperate designs beget desperate code
[12:23:34] <frankfurt> Would people argue that Linux only got popular after Apache came out as a killer app?

[12:24:27] <riv> linux is a really interesting case too
[12:24:35] <riv> the whole linux/minux thing

[12:25:43] <martian67> thus the tea leaf reading begins
[12:25:49] <wink> frankfurt: depends on your niche. Linux was already being used, but the web boom was important for adoption, apache could've been a lot worse and still provide traction for linux servers. being available would've been enough\
[12:25:51] <varjag> minix sucked
[12:25:57] <riv> minix is really good now though
[12:26:00] <riv> v2 or whatever

[12:26:38] <varjag> riv: fair enough
[12:26:44] <varjag> but linux is really really good now too
[12:26:50] <riv> it is!
[12:27:16] <wink> frankfurt: also (my memory is a bit hazy there) without Linux there would've been a ton more Apache webservers on FreeBSD by 98-02
[12:27:24] <frankfurt> Take food recipes for example. There are some secret food recipes, but the knowledge chefs have is essentially open source because it has been open source for centuries. I wonder if this would have been the fate of software as it is also too easy to copy and replicate, like food recipes.
[12:27:47] <varjag> wink: without linux there would not be freebsd
[12:27:52] <frankfurt> wink: I was comparing Linux to Windows when I suggested Apache.
[12:28:26] <riv> frankfurt, oh there's secret recipes from rome? or greece about making this fire..napalm like stuff that's been completely lost
[12:28:46] <martian67> i think its more accurate to say without GNU there would not have been freebsd/freely licensed BSDs varjag, but even thats pretty speculative
[12:29:05] <varjag> yes that's what i meant
[12:29:19] <varjag> regents of whatever were pretty tight about licensing at first
[12:29:49] <frankfurt> Richard Stallman was a trigger, but it feels disturbing that rational men would reject the infinitely better strategy of open source because it's not popular in corporations. Makes me think hard how many other aspects of life we take for granted that didn't have a Stallman.

[12:29:51] <martian67> all you can really say with any real historicity is that bsd was licensed as it was explicitly because of the GNU GPL

[12:32:27] <varjag> i think you got it exactly backwards
[12:32:36] <frankfurt> riv: This reasoning of "sounds good, doesn't work" keeps getting propped up to justify intellectual property many times. It's completely false, as many programmers would testify from experience. I just mean that there could be many many other types of societal structures which are never questioned.
[12:32:41] <varjag> fsf/gnu licensing is nto popular in corporations
[12:32:46] <frankfurt> varjag: It has become popular lately.
[12:33:05] <varjag> no, "open source" was the corporate embrace very much from the start
[12:33:11] <wink> nah you simply need to differentiate between a few cases
[12:33:18] <varjag> free software but wit ha commercial slant
[12:33:23] <wink> a) using without modifying = often cost savings, fine
[12:33:36] <wink> b) using and repackaging = gtfo, stay away, etc.pp
[12:33:57] <wink> c) "oh we can't buy professional 24/7 support by the vendor" = nope
[12:34:05] <wink> and probably a few more hard cases
[12:34:14] <frankfurt> varjag: I know the difference between open-source and free. I was under the impression that open-source became popular only after the Free Software Movement, didn't it?
[12:34:38] <varjag> it certainly piggy-backed on it
[12:34:52] <martian67> Open Source was a rebranding of the free software movement
[12:35:06] <frankfurt> varjag: Yes, well if there were no trigger like Stallman, would open-source have been independently popular?
[12:35:21] <frankfurt> varjag: If yes, there is still hope for humanity, lol.
[12:35:59] <varjag> without stallman i believe we'd have some evolution of shareware scene instead but am certainly not clairvoyant
[12:36:31] <martian67> I think its a dangerous assumption that "because something seems rational, it is inevitable"
[12:36:36] <varjag> i do think his contribution was defining and monumental
[12:36:41] <martian67> history has plenty of counter examples
[12:37:01] <frankfurt> martian67: I think it was Hegel who said that, lol.
[12:37:03] <varjag> yup
[12:37:05] <martian67> its very whig-history esque
[12:37:32] <frankfurt> martian67: Don't you think intellectual property would decline in the future?
[12:37:56] <martian67> I don't know, its certainly not a given
[12:38:24] <frankfurt> martian67: I think (hope) it would. Then future generations would look at Elsevier, etc. as slave-owners and Sci-Hub as Abraham Lincoln, lol.
[12:38:39] <wink> I think it's getting more involved

[12:43:14] <varjag> iDrougge: begging isn't this century invention tho
[12:43:15] <frankfurt> iDrougge: It certainly is.
[12:43:34] <iDrougge> varjag: Not in civilised societies, no.
[12:43:36] <varjag> it only became digitized as all other aspects of life
[12:43:37] <frankfurt> iDrougge: It's quite meaningless with property too.

[12:44:02] <wink> only in America?
[12:44:08] <frankfurt> iDrougge: You can't copyright ideas. You can't copyright creation. Just like you can't own people. It's a matter of time before we realise that.
[12:44:22] <martian67> why is it a matter of time
[12:45:03] <frankfurt> martian67: It's the march of history and so on and so on... At least I like to think so. It helps me sleep better at night.
[12:45:13] <iDrougge> frankfurt: But if we allow other kinds of property but not intellectual property, it just means that the tangible-property-havers will hold an unfair advantage over those with creative talents.
[12:45:19] <varjag> can and cant are rather meaningless when you talk about legal conventions
[12:45:28] <varjag> you absolutely can copyright stuff
[12:45:42] <martian67> "the march of history" doesn't mean anything, history isn't one long path where the "human condition" gets better and better
[12:45:54] <martian67> again, see the concept of whig history
[12:45:57] <frankfurt> varjag: Well, 150 years ago you absolutely can have owned people, legally.
[12:46:04] <varjag> not me
[12:46:10] <frankfurt> martian67: I was half joking. Never mind.
[12:46:18] <iDrougge> Not in a civilised society, mind you.
[12:46:57] <varjag> neither my ancestors for that matter
[12:47:37] <martian67> take the supposition that the concept of actual property is almost as irrational as intellectual property
[12:47:38] <frankfurt> martian67: I know that. I live near a forest and the tribals are more egalitarian and happy with their life than Western liberals. Before you accuse me of propagating the noble savage fallacy, I recognise that imposition of left-wing ideas on primitive society is meaningless but it just proves that there is no march. I agree.
[12:47:48] <martian67> doesn't really matter if you agree or disagree with that
[12:47:48] <varjag> anyway, by comparing insignificant things like copyright to holocaust or slavery you do a disservice
[12:48:03] <varjag> instead of aggrandizing the former you erase the latter
[12:48:37] <frankfurt> varjag: I did not compare it to the Holocaust. I didn't even start the mention of Hitler. Someone else did.
[12:48:40] <martian67> there is certainly a lot of overlap though, the ownership of actual property is as much a fiction as the concept of intelectual property
[12:48:58] <martian67> in that "its all in people's heads"
[12:49:09] <martian67> just like the value of money
[12:49:24] <frankfurt> varjag: The concept of ownership of land is as fictional as concept of ownership of humans.
[12:49:41] <varjag> see, you just did it again
[12:49:57] <frankfurt> varjag: It's as fictional as unicorns, happy now?
[12:50:04] <varjag> no am not
[12:50:12] <varjag> concept of ownership of humans was very real
[12:50:15] <varjag> humans were owned
[12:50:23] <varjag> traded and killed at will
[12:50:31] <martian67> what matters here is the belief in such a thing
[12:50:42] <frankfurt> varjag: Certainly they were.
[12:50:43] <iDrougge> One moral problem with slavery, though, is that he who cultivates the land doesn't own the fruits of his own labour. So even if you didn't own the land, you could possibly own the crops you grow on it. But a slave will not.
[12:50:53] <martian67> fictional is not the same thing as "doesn't matter"
[12:51:09] <frankfurt> varjag: I'm sorry if you thought that I was disputing the existence of slavery.
[12:51:32] *** Quits: plow (~plow@user/plow) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:52:06] <frankfurt> varjag: I'm disputing the real existence of property right as a universal among manking. It's fictional because it doesn't exist in all human societies, unlike disease or war.
[12:52:17] <frankfurt> s/manking/mankind/
[12:52:20] *** Quits: dibas (~dibas@user/dibas) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[12:52:27] <varjag> i mean sure no social construct is universal
[12:52:39] <varjag> claiming they aren't *real* tho is a stretch
[12:53:00] <martian67> they are real in  the sense that people believe in them
[12:53:01] <iDrougge> I didn't know war existed in all societies. I thought that, like property, was something someone forced on you.
[12:53:07] <frankfurt> varjag: There are many universal social constructs. Co-operation. Love for opposite sex. Love for children, etc.
[12:53:20] <varjag> martian67: not just believe, but act on them and enforce them upon others
[12:53:30] <martian67> yes, which is what counts
[12:53:53] <martian67> they are not real in the sense "the universe has caused the concept of private property to arise"
[12:54:02] <frankfurt> varjag: They are mostly related to biologicals.
[12:54:05] <martian67> except in a silly sense
[12:54:16] <martian67> in that, we arose in the universe
[12:54:33] <varjag> martian67: sure, but all good things are not likewise real then
[12:54:41] <varjag> like the universal unalianable human rights
[12:54:56] <martian67> I never called them bad (or good)
[12:54:59] <varjag> which were demonstrably not universal and very much alianable all the time
[12:55:13] <martian67> I am only calling them mental constructions
[12:55:22] <frankfurt> varjag: Do you really think you would have advocated for the abolition of slavery in 1800? If yes, name one thing which is as engraved in American society as slavery which you would advocate against.
[12:55:37] <frankfurt> varjag: How about 1400?
[12:55:39] <varjag> if you take that philosophical ark of determinism far enough you can claim the social constructs were inevitable too
[12:55:42] <varjag> right from the big bang
[12:56:20] <varjag> frankfurt: i hope i would but i cetrainly would have no way to know
[12:56:47] <varjag> in 1800s i'd likely be an illiterate peasant far from classic slaveowner societies
[12:56:49] <frankfurt> varjag: Is there any *construct* of human society now which you would like to abolition practically?
[12:57:02] <frankfurt> s/abolition/abolish/
[12:57:17] <varjag> podcasters
[12:57:19] <varjag> cable tcv
[12:57:21] <varjag> tv
[12:57:47] <martian67> this is getting a bit sidetracked, to bring it back a bit, I see nothing about IP being a social construct that ultimately will cause its demise
[12:57:56] <varjag> but seriously there are things that we can glimpse going to be very immoral
[12:58:03] <frankfurt> varjag: That's not a construct. Advertisement or mass-media is. Those are manifestations.
[12:58:36] <frankfurt> varjag: You want to throw out the bad stuff and keep the good stuff. That's reform. Not revolution.
[12:58:37] <varjag> that are broadly accepted now
[12:58:39] <martian67> plenty of equally problematic (from a epistemological POV) have long pervaded human history
[12:58:57] <varjag> frankfurt: you want to throw out the good stuff too then?
[12:59:05] <martian67>  equally problematic concepts rather
[12:59:15] <frankfurt> varjag: I asked for a revolution. Like the abolition of slavery. You're suggesting "we should treat the slaves better, etc."
[12:59:37] <varjag> you repeat my point about comparing random insignificant shit to slavery
[13:00:07] <varjag> fucking kids these days who knew no hardships
[13:00:15] <martian67> thats why its dangerous to say "IP isn't natural, nothing gives people ownership over ideas, so the idea will not stand"
[13:00:33] <martian67> because plenty of other equally "absurd" concepts have lasted a great deal longer than IP
[13:01:00] <frankfurt> varjag: So, any construct in modern liberal life is random and insignificant and can only be reformed. sLaVeRy was the only one which had to be thrown out. That's what is the belief which is called "The End of History Illusion". Regardless, history doesn't end in 2021.
[13:01:20] <varjag> a lot was thrown out
[13:01:21] <varjag> monarchy
[13:01:30] <varjag> voting inequality
[13:01:31] <martian67> because the same sort of logic underlies say, private property, the value of money, religion, probly a billion other things besides
[13:01:52] <martian67> and those haven't gone away, and there is little indication they ever will
[13:01:54] <frankfurt> varjag: Similarly, I believe intellectual property... and in due time... private property would be thrown out.
[13:02:10] <varjag> dude i grew up in ussr, i lived your dream
[13:02:26] <EdwardIII> interesting
[13:02:50] <frankfurt> varjag: I'm sorry USSR was not an abolition of private property. No wonder you're biased and repulsvie against the idea.
[13:03:00] <frankfurt> s/svie/sive/
[13:03:05] <varjag> it was absolutely an abolition of private property
[13:03:11] <varjag> if you don't count petty possessions
[13:03:16] <EdwardIII> varjag: were you a child when the union disolved, or did you experience it as an adult?
[13:03:42] <varjag> i was 15 i think
[13:03:49] <varjag> old enough for komsoml
[13:03:53] <varjag> komsomol
[13:04:07] <frankfurt> varjag: Certainly, if you believe abolition to be taking away of property by old bureaucrats who control all aspect of life through a dystopian bureaucratic machine. I'm sure you have heard the story many times.
[13:04:35] <varjag> no, i mean you would literally get prison time for owning a lathe in your garage
[13:04:41] <varjag> because it was means of production
[13:04:49] <frankfurt> varjag: Of course you would.
[13:04:58] <EdwardIII> i have a friend who was around that age in poland when it happened, it's super interesting
[13:05:10] <varjag> poland was a tad softer
[13:05:14] <frankfurt> varjag: They confiscated it, didn't they?
[13:05:20] <EdwardIII> we play Twilight Struggle together
[13:06:11] <varjag> frankfurt: there was a whole subunit of secret police, OBKhSS, dedicated to finging people who own too much
[13:06:54] <frankfurt> varjag: Ownership of means of production by a state machinery which is run by careerist bureacucratic pigs is not an abolition of property just like ownership of property by suit wearning executives isn't. It's not my dream, lol.
[13:06:59] <varjag> EdwardIII: poland was in it only after the war and of course being occupied they weren't half enthusiastic about it
[13:07:04] <varjag> plus culture differences
[13:07:08] <varjag> like, poland had smut
[13:07:14] <varjag> which is again, prison time in ussr
[13:07:25] <varjag> frankfurt: do you want to abolish porn
[13:08:19] <varjag> frankfurt: the bureaucrats didn't really own it either
[13:08:29] <varjag> they also weren't really well off in the western terms
[13:08:52] <bsandro> varjag: obkhss was fighting govt/municipal property theft though (at least on paper)
[13:08:55] <frankfurt> varjag: Although, living in an industrial third world city which was setup with the help of USSR I got a much better childhood than others in my country. So arguably, it's still better than the whip of the white slave-owner or the rich landlord in my country.
[13:09:08] <varjag> much better than the masses, but you probably have more luxurious life than most soviet functionaries
[13:09:53] <varjag> bsandro: it was expanded to "speculants" and and artisan-runners
[13:11:02] <varjag> frankfurt: what really was the payday for soviet bureaucrats is the fall of ussr
[13:11:09] <frankfurt> varjag: I would like if the pornstars don't sell themselves to the production houses who own the means of recording video and distribution. This way they get little value for their *labour*. A much better alternative is amateur stuff uploaded directly to the web, which I regularly enjoy. Although they are still dominated by the platform like PornHub, but that's what we have.
[13:11:20] <varjag> anyone who controlled the socialist property got rich rather quick
[13:11:36] <frankfurt> varjag: Yes, it was. Didn't they all turn into mafia, etc.?
[13:11:50] <varjag> in first few years yes
[13:11:58] <varjag> then it solidified into the government
[13:12:08] <bsandro> varjag: where are you from? if you don't mind me asking
[13:12:15] <frankfurt> varjag: I heard Russia didn't have no police after the break-up of USSR. You had to pay the mafia.
[13:12:20] <varjag> bsandro: belarus
[13:12:32] <frankfurt> varjag: It's still quite bad, isn't it?
[13:12:44] <bsandro> varjag: oh so ussr is still a thing there :P
[13:13:02] <varjag> bsandro: it's different really
[13:13:09] <frankfurt> varjag: Don't worry man. Police in my country is still mafia in everything but name.
[13:13:10] <varjag> just a classic ditatorship
[13:13:14] <bsandro> yeah I know, I'm just joking
[13:13:16] <varjag> nothing with proletariat anymore
[13:13:48] <frankfurt> varjag: What are the dissidents called in your country, anti-nationalists?
[13:13:51] <varjag> frankfurt: the police was there but it was corrupt like everything else
[13:14:00] <varjag> frankfurt: the opposite
[13:14:16] <varjag> in that way .by is an outlier
[13:14:27] <varjag> lukashenko is all for soviet aesthetics
[13:14:31] <varjag> it was hot in mid-1990s
[13:14:54] <varjag> and that necessitates that his opposition have to be nationalists and stooges of the west
[13:16:13] <frankfurt> varjag: I see why you revolt with the mention of abolition of private property, lol. It's quite personal.
[13:16:15] <bsandro> i feel like Lukashenko is a spirit animal of our Putin
[13:16:26] <frankfurt> bsandro: You're Russian?
[13:16:31] <bsandro> aye
[13:16:38] <frankfurt> bsandro: Da?
[13:16:43] <varjag> bsandro: he technically predates him but yes they are same breed
[13:16:45] *** Joins: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa)
[13:17:19] <bsandro> frankfurt: da, tovarisch :D
[13:17:43] <frankfurt> varjag: What was the difference between old Soviet republics which are freer like Ukraine and Belarus
[13:18:10] <varjag> frankfurt: lukashenko didn't fight private property, as i mentioned it's a non-ideological personalist dictatorship
[13:18:35] <varjag> but life rapidly became easier after ussr disintegration
[13:18:48] <varjag> like you suddenly could buy food without spending 6 hrs in queues
[13:18:54] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:19:06] <frankfurt> varjag: I mean there certainly are more liberal countries like Ukraine. Is Ukriane like that just because there was no personality cult or where there some qualitative differences?
[13:19:16] <frankfurt> s/where/were/
[13:19:18] <varjag> frankfurt: ukraine is the freest if you discount the baltics
[13:19:28] <frankfurt> varjag: Yes.
[13:19:28] <bsandro> varjag: well not "suddenly", there were 90s first as a "buffer time"
[13:19:44] <frankfurt> varjag: I asked because Belarus is very close to both but still is a dictatorship.
[13:19:47] <varjag> bsandro: i'm talking about 1990s
[13:19:53] <varjag> (because i remember 1980s)
[13:19:56] <frankfurt> s/close/close geographically/
[13:20:00] <bsandro> 90s weren't even slightest fun imho
[13:20:58] <varjag> bsandro: by 1995 soviet standard of life was very much exceeded
[13:21:10] <varjag> the biggest negative was that alcohol became super cheap
[13:21:12] <bsandro> varjag: in Belarus?
[13:21:20] <varjag> everyone who wanted could drink themselves to death
[13:21:24] <varjag> and many did
[13:21:35] <bsandro> i lived mid-russia back then and it was honestly a shitshow
[13:21:42] <varjag> yes it was a shitshow
[13:21:51] <varjag> again my point about 1980s
[13:21:59] <varjag> late 80s were worse than early 90s
[13:22:03] *** Quits: frankfurt (~nick@59.88.24.196) (Quit: leaving)
[13:22:09] <varjag> same level of crime and lack of everything in addition
[13:22:38] <varjag> i mean objectively, from western pov it was certainly still shit
[13:23:23] <bsandro> i lived in moscow past decade or so, life there is still vastly different from the rest of russia

[17:02:34] <Brekkjern> Only one of the questions are about common issues with floats. The other ones might technically come from how floats work in the background, but few languages expose that kind of stuff
[17:03:13] <Brekkjern> I know NaN is a thing, but I haven't used a language apart from JS that exposes that to me

[17:05:58] <wink> we actually had a float rounding problem in JS at my last job
[17:06:03] <wink> with coordinates
[17:07:34] <rbasak> I think floating point support is a historical accident because of engineering workloads in computing history.
[17:08:23] <rbasak> If CPUs had built-in support for rationals, then so would C, and we wouldn't jump to use floats whenever we needed fractional values.
[17:09:41] <iDrougge> Brekkjern: Agreed re: NaN.
[17:10:29] <iDrougge> rbasak: How many CPUs had floating point support when C was made? I know my first computers didn't.
[17:11:31] <rbasak> iDrougge: you're going further back than I was thinking, then.
[17:12:05] <rbasak> Early floating point support needed quite a bit of silicon and was generally missed out, but most C environments could emulate I think?
[17:12:09] <iDrougge> I'm about the same age as IEEE754.
[17:12:32] <iDrougge> If you can emulate FP, you can emulate any other representation.

[17:12:50] <rbasak> But it wasn't considered necessary to make rationals part of the language. That's my point.
[17:12:55] <iDrougge> I wonder if hardware BCD support wasn't more common, yet C doesn't support that.
[17:13:47] <rbasak> When you have to use a library to get rational (fraction) support, but floating point is part of the language, people will just use floating point even when not appropriate.
[17:13:52] <iDrougge> If rationals required 1 % more work, it wouldn't be part of C.
[17:13:56] <rbasak> Especially because beginners get taught that way.
[17:14:10] <iDrougge> rbasak: Exactly. I saw my little brother being taught that only a month ago.
[17:15:11] <rbasak> OTOH, if rationals were considered essential enough early enough, then they might have made it into CPU instruction sets, at which point C would have had to expose them directly, and they'd be part of the language.
[17:15:28] <rbasak> And therefore the floating point kneejerk might not have developed
[17:16:15] <iDrougge> I don't know; C doesn't expose BCD maths, nor does it support fix point which is easy to implement.
[17:17:18] <rbasak> If floats hadn't existed, I think C would have found a more integrated solution than requiring libraries and structs
[17:17:54] <iDrougge> Sounds like a question for retrocomputing.stackexchange.com
[17:20:14] <ngoldbaum> rbasak: you can’t do engineering or many scientific calculations with rationals (or at least it’s not particularly natural), floats are much more natural choices
[17:20:47] <ngoldbaum> in fact they were designed to keep as much precision and accuracy as possible for scientific use cases…
