[14:48:35] <tykling> so is there ever any legitimate reason to send an NDR? shouldn't it be possible to reject everything in the smtp stage?
[14:53:08] <pj> it's best to do so if you can.  A legitimate reason to send an NDR is if you're the submission server.
[14:55:25] <pekster> Keep in mind if you're speaking from an MUA perspective (that of a user) you don't really know if a recipient's server is willing to accept the mail when the SMTP action is completed to the sending server.
[15:06:51] <pj> more importantly the MUA will be authenticated to the submission server, so you know that the envelope sender is not spoofed.
[15:08:27] *** Quits: Guest6792 (~vit@chello085216193138.chello.sk) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:09:49] <tykling> yes, ok, so the submission server can send an NDR to its own users, that makes sense
[15:11:11] <pekster> Right, but that can also be delayed as the action of that server to the various recipients' MTAs is an asynchronous operation.
[15:11:24] <pj> as for other servers, try to minimize it.  The ideal scenario is that you never send an NDR.
[15:12:23] <pj> My rule of thumb is reject whenever possible and if you can't reject then deliver to the recipient's SPAM folder, and only send an NDR if neither of those two actions are feasible.
[15:17:01] <tykling> thanks for the input
[15:17:41] <Khepra> pj: about my TLS q in #postfix, but what do you think about strong TLS requirements (TLS1.2+)  on submission(s)? I'd assume that in 2022, all the MUAs are more than capable.
[15:18:04] <Khepra> so I'm thinking, set default to strong, override for port25 smtpd (use weak)
[15:18:45] <bremner> I'm somewhat worried / annoyed by the fact that mailman3 spews NDRs reports to all non-subscriber posts. I don't know a fix (other than not using mailman) though
[15:19:00] <bremner> s/NDRs reports/NDRs/
[15:20:15] <tykling> related question, I seem to recall using LMTP helps to reduce NDRs, how? does the MTA initiate an LMTP session to ask about deliverability of each recipient during the SMTP conversation or what happens?
[15:21:09] <bremner> I guess maybe the mailman spew is not formally NDR, dunno
[15:26:33] <pj> Khepra: it's submission, so it's really a matter of what you think your own users are capable of and how firmly you wish to force them to get current.
[15:27:55] <pj> bremner: I would be concerned about that as well.  I'm not sure what protections mailman has to mitigate the damage.  It certainly seems to be capable of turning your system into a source of backscatter on the surface.
[15:28:01] <Khepra> right, and they'll complain if I'be being too..... nazi.... about it :)
[15:28:10] <Khepra> *I'm being
[15:28:59] <pj> note that you don't have to explicitly override port25, postfix has separate TLS settings for mandatory encryption vs opportunistic encryption.
[15:30:48] <tykling> I had no idea exim was so popular, I don't know a single person who prefers exim over postfix, how weird. maybe the survey is off or maybe my worldview is biased :) http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.202201/mxsurvey.html
[15:31:38] <bremner> tykling: exim is still default on Debian, so maybe that skews things
[15:35:55] <tykling> okay I didn't know that, survey also says a large part doesn't reveal softwar 
[15:37:00] <Khepra> exim is used by all the cpanel installations, which are many
