[00:13:07] <da_wunder> we don't know how your application is using those, and we don't know what you're doing on that try/catch block
[00:13:54] <F8ER> Just a test function which throws an exception. Its caller uses try/catch to catch it, changes HTTP code, and throws the same exception.
[00:14:07] <da_wunder> Zombie_Ryushu: I would start with that error stacktrace - it should show you exactly where _you're_ calling that
[00:14:08] <F8ER> HTTP status code*
[00:14:50] <F8ER> In the result, the above logic results in 2 identical exception messages in PHP error logs.
[00:15:11] <F8ER> Without "rethrowing" the exception no messages appear in logs at all.
[00:15:45] <F8ER> So, like rethrowing the catched exception adds 2 identical exception message in logs instead of 1.

[01:03:02] <F8ER> This 8.0 "__toString" thing recalls C# <3
[01:03:38] <F8ER> Related: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.tostring?view=net-6.0
[01:03:47] <F8ER> .NET *
[01:04:17] <__adrian> ?
[01:04:34] <__adrian> __toString() has been around quite a while
[01:05:11] <__adrian> also note it's usually the wrong solution to what most people are trying to solve
[01:05:16] <F8ER> > As of PHP 8.0.0, any class that contains a __toString() method will also implicitly implement the Stringable interface, and will thus pass type checks for that interface. Explicitly implementing the interface anyway is recommended.
[01:05:21] <F8ER> From: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.tostring
[01:05:38] <F8ER> It's like Object.ToString in .NET
[01:05:44] <F8ER> An awesome thing
[01:07:18] <F8ER> However, the ReflectionClass::__toString is from PHP5
[01:10:12] <__adrian> ah, that part. yes.
[01:10:36] <__adrian> though it doesn't change the fact that most uses of tostring are wrongsolutions
[01:10:51] <F8ER> What would you call a wrong usage?
[01:12:40] <__adrian> for example, it's often used for templating or serialization
[01:13:19] <__adrian> there aren't really some "good uses" - best i've seen is how guzzle uses it to make http Response objects printable
[01:15:01] <da_wunder> __toString - is for me just to show something in nice way for debugging - no real use case in actual code solution
[01:15:04] <F8ER> Oh. I see. Imho, indeed serialization/copy/deepcopy requires separate functionality
[01:15:40] <__adrian> all the more-legit uses are covered by something else. Serializable, JsonSerializable, __debugInfo
[01:15:58] <da_wunder> ^
[01:16:00] <__adrian> imo it was a half-baked idea in the first place
[01:16:01] <F8ER> Indeed, __toString is like for debugging. It's handy for fast in-string conversation for Exception message i.e.
[01:16:08] <F8ER> convertion*
[01:16:34] <__adrian> use https://php.net/__debugInfo#object.debuginfo
[01:23:03] <__adrian> ...like i said above re: http messages,  might be ok for other representations of specific text formats (e.g., if DomDocument::__toString() existed and made xml, that might be appropriate/nice)

[01:51:00] <TML> it'd be nice if we had decided up front whether __toString() meant "string representation of the object's internals" or "string serialization of object"
[01:53:32] <stenno> should be the first right
[01:55:03] <TML> *shrug* I can make the argument for either (but not both)
[01:55:07] <stenno> wait not even internal
[01:55:19] <stenno> 'string representation of an object'
[01:55:45] <TML> Well, if you're not representing its internals, then the only thing there is to represent is something you can get from class_name()

[01:56:11] <biberu> i feel like arguing for neither ;)
[01:56:35] <stenno> in js, the string representation of any object is like '[Object object]'
[01:56:46] <__adrian> "TML> it'd be nice if we had decided ..." yeah but how exactly would that have been enforced?
[01:57:06] <TML> stenno: Right - to represent anything more than the class name requires representing internals
[01:57:12] <stenno> yep
[01:57:21] <__adrian> ftr, i'm also on the side of "it should just go away"
[01:57:37] <__adrian> *"should have just never been"
[01:57:56] <stenno> internals can get complicated if you have properties that are functions
[01:57:56] <TML> __adrian: It's not something I think we should have been worrying about from an _enforcement_ standpoint, but if we had clearly communicated an *intent* it would have given better guidance to developers
[01:59:02] <TML> stenno: Well, I'm not saying you have to represent ALL of its internals, but if you don't expose SOME internal state, you're just class_name()
[01:59:30] <TML> I keep saying class_name when I mean get_class
[01:59:44] <__adrian> just speaking from a practical standpoint

[02:01:45] <stenno> wasn't there a way to explicitely inspect an object in php?
[02:01:51] <stenno> var_export ?
[02:01:58] <TML> __adrian: Heh - I haven't seen that {you know which one} construct before, looks really useful ;)
[02:02:04] <F8ER> stenno, even Minecraft with its Java was lol
[02:02:12] <__adrian> var_export makes code. var_dump inspects

[02:03:06] <__adrian> var_export?
[02:03:22] <__adrian> it's code generation
[02:03:24] <stenno> __adrian: yeah what is it that var_export does, what is the intention
[02:03:28] <stenno> hmm ok
[02:03:28] <TML> __adrian: I don't have a problem with __toString existing, I just wish we had clearer guidelines like you find in __str__ vs __repr__ in the Python world

[02:05:50] <TML> __adrian: Well, if you go with the "representation" interpretation, __toString() becomes a powerful design-time tool with very little practical application at run-time.
[02:06:23] <BadAdviceCat> TML, I see you're making bank off that issue, I remember reading about the issue. I'm like "Ah, nice, it doesn't affect me."
[02:06:55] <BadAdviceCat> The Java log thing.
[02:07:28] <__adrian> TML: do you imagine something usefully distinct from __debugInfo() ?
[02:07:50] <TML> BadAdviceCat: I have basically done nothing since November but fix people's log4j issues
[02:08:03] <__adrian> "BadAdviceCat> it doesn't affect me"  // yeah except really it probably does
[02:08:33] <TML> __adrian: Well, __debugInfo came AFTER __toString, though

[02:08:53] <__adrian> that's why i consider __toString() half-baked

[04:26:50] <__adrian> don't know if you're joking, but if you think there's been stagnation, look again
[04:27:04] <jadew> don't know man...
[04:27:12] <__adrian> yes, i noticed
[04:27:19] <__adrian> ;)
[04:27:36] <jadew> hacklang showed what was missing in PHP
[04:28:02] <jadew> (aka better type support)
[04:29:01] <jadew> anyway, so... I kinda want to be able to pass a class that I don't intend to instantiate as a parameter to a base class
[04:29:04] <jadew> any suggestions?
[04:29:13] <Albright> Type support is one of the things that has come along the furthest in the past few releases.
[04:29:22] <__adrian> kinda of an unusual thing
[04:29:24] <jadew> I know, but not far enough
[04:29:31] <__adrian> doees it need to be a particular interface?
[04:29:52] <jadew> yes, ideally, I would like to force it to extend an interface too
[04:29:57] <jadew> *to implement
[04:30:12] <__adrian> take a string and validate using is_a()
[04:30:36] <jadew> and how do I access static members?
[04:30:41] <__adrian> e.g.,  new MyClass(MyOtherClass::class);
[04:30:44] <__adrian> with ::
[04:30:59] <jadew> 'whatever'::test() - works?
[04:31:28] <jadew> guess I should try it

[04:32:17] <__adrian> but note, you'd be doing something more like  $this->$yourclassname::foo

[04:34:06] <jadew> but I'm happy it does
[04:34:33] <__adrian> strings are the "first class" representation of classes/functions/etc.
[04:35:07] <jadew> what do you mean by first class? what should I search for to read more about this?
[04:35:11] <__adrian> note my  ::class  example above, if you were not familiar with it
[04:35:16] <jadew> I am
[04:35:41] <__adrian> i just mean, that's how classes/etc. are identified - by name. and the name is a string.

[18:54:20] <gamara> what is <=>
[18:54:25] <Naktibalda> also you are comparing timestamps to timezones
[18:54:50] <Naktibalda> you shoud decide if all timezones come before all timestamps or another way aroud
[18:55:19] <Naktibalda> isn't getTimezone() a bug?
[18:55:31] <gamara> it is

[18:55:56] <Naktibalda> sort function must only return 0 when Items are equal

[18:59:46] <gamara> still wrong ;_;
[19:01:02] <Naktibalda> of course, change >= to <=>
[19:02:05] <Naktibalda> probably you don't need strtotime, unless your timestamps are in some odd format
[19:03:18] <gamara> I am using datetimeImmutable
[19:03:58] <Naktibalda> so getTimestamp() returns integer, right?
[19:04:03] <gamara> yes
[19:04:14] <Naktibalda> what do you expect to get when you pass integer to strtotime?
[19:04:59] <gamara> I think I tried strtotime it just breaks
[19:05:23] <gamara> oh yeah meant to remove that
[19:05:28] <Naktibalda> strtotime converts human readable time formats to integer
[19:06:44] <gamara> so I removed it but it still has the same problem 2022-01-31 20:09:38 is under 2022-01-31 19:49:35
[19:08:45] <gamara> its like time isn't taken into consideration with timestamp
[19:09:31] <TinoDidriksen> Show the getTimestamp() code. It's probably due to TZ.
[19:09:48] <Naktibalda> it is DateTimeImmutable

[19:26:17] <Naktibalda> you can't set column name like that
[19:26:51] <Naktibalda> your query is effectively SELECT "price3"
[19:26:53] <__adrian> parameters are for data, not for identifiers (e.g., column names).
[19:27:54] <__adrian> if you don't know which column you want to select, (a) why not? (b) use a whitelist
[19:27:56] <craigbass76> Is it safe to just run SELECT itemNumber, itemDesc, $friendlyPrice, baseUM... ?
[19:28:01] <__adrian> no
[19:28:04] <__adrian> absolutely not
[19:28:07] <__adrian> !+whitelist
[19:28:08] <php-bot> a "whitelist" is a list of acceptable values which you can compare an unknown value to, in order to be sure it is valid.  https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/2c52877992b96525820b

[19:38:14] <__adrian> just by chance
[19:41:42] <TinoDidriksen> I think the issue is simply that you don't fall back to comparing ctime in cases where utime is identical.
[19:44:28] <__adrian> well, do you _intend_ to sometimes compare ctime to utime?
[19:48:28] <gamara> well utime will always be greater than ctime
[19:48:46] <gamara> so if utime exists I should only compare with utime
[19:48:52] <__adrian> gamara: would you expect these to be sorted like  F,ThW,ThT,Th,TM  ?  https://3v4l.org/I7mCP
[19:49:14] <gamara> I would expect the one modified last to be at the top
[19:49:23] <gamara> no matter if it was a creation or an update
[19:49:46] <gamara> I am sorting by last touched
[19:49:55] <da_wunder> I would just set that updated at time to same as created time IF that updated at is passed as a null on constructor, then you could always just compare those updatedAt properties
