[04:39:46] <re101-uakari-97-> hi -- i clicked 'live help' on regex101.com -- don't need help per se, but a quick suggestion (and happy to learn how, if it's already implemented):
[04:39:47] <re101-uakari-97-> how to invoke regex101.com with a specified RE type?Â  i know about settings -- i want a pasteable url i can give to other people, where they can immediately start playing with JS REs
[04:39:50] *** Joins: rvalue (~rvalue@user/rvalue)
[04:40:17] <OnlineCop> Do you mean some regex that you've created previously, saved, and shared the link with?
[04:40:44] <re101-uakari-97-> no, just the raw blank editor, preconfigured to ECMA/JS RE
[04:40:46] <OnlineCop> There used to also be an API that could be used to pass in a GET query, although I don't remember that one off the top of my head.
[04:41:01] <OnlineCop> Oh, just the flavor to be set?
[04:41:11] <re101-uakari-97-> i want to be able to give a url out in a forum post, 'here is where you can fiddle with JS REs'
[04:43:57] <OnlineCop> I know we can do this with the codegen; I'm looking over https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/wiki/API to see whether they have it for just pre-selecting the flavor.
[04:45:25] <re101-uakari-97-> i've just noticed & tested the 'save re' feature -- confirmed that it *does* override the user's saved RE type setting.Â  but it won't allow me to save a completely blank RE.Â  i can go find the bit of page code that rejects an empty RE for saving, override it, and win.

[04:50:25] <re101-uakari-97-> bingo, thanks!
[04:50:25] <re101-uakari-97-> suggestion: in the selection table of RE flavors, give a permalink to each flavor (i.e. with embedded ?flavor=what)
[04:50:59] <OnlineCop> Not a bad idea.

[13:32:25] <rendar> if i have this matching in JS: `return /^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(evt.key);` what is the safest way to insert space and all symbols ~!@#$%^&*()_+-=/,.<> ?
[13:39:37] <purplex> insert where?
[13:40:32] <rendar> into the regex
[13:41:57] <Me-me> Heh.
[13:42:56] <purplex> escape: [~!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\/,\.<>]
[13:43:22] <Me-me> You forgot space.
[13:43:34] <purplex> wheres the space?
[13:43:45] <purplex> oh there
[13:43:51] <purplex> [~!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\/,\.<>\ ]
[13:44:47] <rendar> so, `return /^[a-z0-9~!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\/,\.<>\ ]$/i.test(evt.key);` ?
[13:45:42] <purplex> no idea what your goal is, you asked for a regex. what do you want it to do?
[13:46:28] <rendar> purplex, basically to allow all "printable" characaters, such as a-z 0-9 and symbols to be matched
[13:47:21] <purplex> the regex will match a single symbol from the set of all symbols
[13:48:07] <rendar> i was wondering if there was a method to say 'all symbols' instead of specifying them one by one
[13:48:45] <purplex> one or more symbols or zero or more symbols?
[13:49:38] <rendar> only one symbol
[13:50:05] <rendar> i mean, `return /^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(evt.key);` expects evt.key to be only one string containing ONE char a-z or 0-9 right? 
[13:50:09] <purplex> can we create a regex101 link for it?
[13:50:51] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/pZ1gnr/1
[13:50:58] <rendar> https://regex101.com/r/4xbqYW/1
[13:51:01] <rendar> yes
[13:51:18] <rendar> it doesn't work
[13:51:21] <rendar> it doesn't match 'a'
[13:51:50] <purplex> you have ^ after the phrase 'return', i don't think it will work
[13:51:59] <rendar> so you why pasted it?
[13:52:00] <Me-me> purplex: Remember to remove the bits that are just code. https://regex101.com/r/pZ1gnr/2
[13:52:26] <Me-me> rendar: Try using a + (quantifier, means 1 or more) https://regex101.com/r/pZ1gnr/3
[13:52:31] <purplex> so we can solve your problem 
[13:52:54] <rendar> what Me-me posted, is ok
[13:52:55] <rendar> it works
[13:53:21] <purplex> good
[13:53:31] <rendar> i was just wondering not the number of symbols to match! i was just wondering if there was a method to say all symbols instead of `~!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\/,\.<>\` to have a shorter regex!
[13:53:39] <rendar> but i don't want quantifiers + and so on
[13:56:25] <purplex> \W_ can match all symbols except letters and numbers
[13:57:03] <Me-me> Well, it depends on what you mean by "all symbols".
[13:57:07] <Me-me> All characters are symbols, after all.
[13:57:29] <purplex> so you're saying you just randomnly made a list of those symbols, and they're not specific
[13:57:59] <Me-me> Do you want the euro symbol, for example? Or the colon? Semicolon? There are thousands of them.
[13:58:01] <rendar> i see
[13:58:08] <purplex> in that case maybe try [\W_]
[13:58:20] <rendar> ok thanks
[13:58:29] <Me-me> purplex: Keep in mind he's also including the letters and numbers.
[13:58:45] <Me-me> rendar: Once you know what symbols you want to match, we can look for ranges, or ways to otherwise simplify.
[13:58:57] <Me-me> Like ranges.
[13:59:02] <purplex> so he's not sure what he wants yet
[13:59:14] <purplex> then try a . 
[13:59:15] <purplex> :p
[13:59:27] <Me-me> He may or may not be unsure - I'm trying to help him conjugate exactly what he wants, which may also help him figure it out if he doesn't know.

[14:00:53] <purplex> \W excludes _ so we are re-adding it
[14:01:39] <purplex> are you aware that \W won't match a b c or 1 2 3?

[20:48:38] <OnlineCop> What you probably want is substitution.
[20:49:01] <romuo> output text : GoYou
[20:49:16] <OnlineCop> You capture 'Go', match some amount of more text, then capture 'You'.
[20:50:00] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/psjVIj/2
[20:50:39] <OnlineCop> 'Go' is in capture 1, 'You' is in capture 2, and you can use them in your general program.

[21:02:01] <OnlineCop> Your lookbehind and lookahead are both fine, but the text that you're matching is going to still show all the stuff contained within the match.
[21:02:51] <OnlineCop> Take a look on the right side of regex101 and notice that "Match 1" contains the full text, which something like `grep -P` and others are going to display to you. However, it is also showing that your two groups contain the text you DID want to keep.

[22:32:07] <JohnDoe1> re101-kudu-23 is it not possible for you to use one of the many json encoding/decoding options in virtually all lanaguages?
[22:32:57] <re101-kudu-23> this is the value im given and i cant deserialize it
[22:33:41] <JohnDoe1> I see, what language are you trying to regex it in?
