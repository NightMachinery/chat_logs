[02:15:52] <kalven> no, it doesn't mean that

[02:18:26] <yolo_> and I'm an embedded low-level guy that is by wage
[02:18:34] <kalven> yolo_: good thing there are different tools then
[02:19:29] <cbreak> with embedded, it doesn't matter much how efficient you are, customers won't be able to measure it anyway, as long as you're fast enough / not too power hungry
[02:19:38] <Raziel> yolo_, no, it means C++ is so easy and simple that we can easily point out where a compiler does something stupid, and we frequently do it for fun
[02:19:39] <Raziel> :^)
[02:19:57] <cbreak> but when writing code which you want to be proud of, code which you want to run fast and efficient, then understanding the tools is needed
[02:20:02] <cbreak> and looking at ASM can help with that
[02:20:40] <yolo_> i wrote asm and machine code in college, just not at job, like forever
[02:20:57] <Raziel> it's hardly ever something you "need" to do for the vast majority of usecases. but having the option and ability to do it can be useful.

[07:21:45] <KombuchaKip> If I've got a vector<byte> MyVector and I want a raw pointer to the Xth byte, is it &MyVector.at(X), &(MyVector.at(X)), MyVector.data() + X, or something else?
[07:22:54] <computerquip> yolo_, probably need to figure out where it's crashing

[07:24:18] <computerquip> There's a slight difference there with at being checked. There's also the iterator form I suppose.

[07:24:51] <computerquip> Could also just do &MyVector[X]
[07:24:55] <RandomReader> I tend to prefer the .data() form, which matches nicely with what you'd need to do to get an end marker if you wanted a pair of raw pointers to serve as iterators, but they all have the same effect
[07:27:34] <yolo_> computerquip: had a quick look and could not figure out, reported to systemc as a possible bug
[07:29:39] <yolo_> the sad part is that, i have enjoyed glibcxx_debug and sanitize in my practice code, now I realize when I need work with 3rd party libraries, there is no way I can use either of them, as those libraries(unlike glibc) did not build with those flags

[17:18:35] <Simplar> How do I use getline to record the value of the current line into a variable?
[17:18:45] <Simplar> Thing is, each line I read has two numbers separated by a space
[17:18:58] <Simplar> I need to write first number into an array, and second number into an array
[17:19:04] <Simplar> how do I do it with getline?
[17:25:11] <Raziel> Simplar, the simplest would be to get the whole line then split the two numbers after, but you could also do it by alternating getlines with space and \n as delimiter

[17:41:06] <Raziel> https://wandbox.org/permlink/1cuGmKEadzhIjjZN
[17:41:27] <Raziel> but, since this is C++, you should mayhaps avoid raw arrays.

[17:47:45] <Raziel> https://wandbox.org/permlink/0ocRNOIFNrwHueaz although passing std::array is slightly impolite, cause of the requirement for the size in the template
[17:47:47] <ARoxdale> Never pass a raw array. You'll only have to pass the length as well, and then keep passing it for every single function call after.
[17:47:57] <Raziel> so you usually wanna template it v:
[17:48:37] <ARoxdale> No. Wrap it in a slice type struct.
[17:48:48] <Raziel> p a i n
[17:49:05] <ARoxdale> struct Slice { size_t length, T* data}.
[17:49:14] <ARoxdale> It's the easiest thing in the world
[17:49:45] <ARoxdale> You don't even need templates if you use a void* or just typedef everything
[17:49:57] <Raziel> pain and runtime unsafe behaviour
[17:50:36] <ARoxdale> Alright, pass your array length down through half a dozen function calls. I hope nobody modifies it on the way down!!
[17:50:49] <ARoxdale> (I say these things because they happened)
[17:51:05] <Raziel> oh, no, I'm not saying passing a raw array + size is better (even though it is the C way)
[17:51:15] <Raziel> I'm saying templating your functions for std::array is better
[17:52:35] <Raziel> if you must use raw arrays, then sure, wrapping it is nicer than not
[17:52:43] <ARoxdale> It's better than nothing, but the need to template std::array is pretty annoying
[17:53:19] <Raziel> it is. but realistically most things are gonna be using vector over array

[19:18:58] <SuperNintendoSUX> what's a dynamic array?
[19:19:12] <SuperNintendoSUX> be careful with these made up definitions
[19:19:24] <SuperNintendoSUX> they usually are inaccurate and non conforming
[19:19:25] <Simplar> int *myDynamicArray = new int[someDynamicLength];
[19:19:37] <Simplar> this is an integer array with dynamic length
[19:19:38] <SuperNintendoSUX> ok. a raw pointer that owns memory
[19:19:48] <Simplar> Oh, that's a nice definition
[19:20:00] <SuperNintendoSUX> you can use the pointer itself
[19:20:06] <Simplar> if I want to operate with such array in a function, how do I pass it?
[19:20:08] <Simplar> as a pointer?
[19:20:11] <SuperNintendoSUX> but even better. don't use new[] at all
[19:20:21] <SuperNintendoSUX> use vector or unique_ptr
[19:20:32] <Simplar> Let me explain the situation
[19:20:58] <Simplar> Input data: user enters array's length (an integer > 0) and then passes elements for arrays inside that array
[19:20:59] <SuperNintendoSUX> but yeah, pass the pointer and the length if you HAVE or REALLY WANT to use this crap
[19:21:14] <Simplar> so the resulting array is [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]] etc
[19:21:27] <SuperNintendoSUX> if you can do proper C++, then use vector and just pass a reference to it
[19:21:41] <Simplar> vector can handle arrays in arrays?
[19:21:49] <Simplar> like... vector in vectors?
[19:21:51] <SuperNintendoSUX> yeah! can be a simple vector or a vector of vectors
[19:21:57] <Simplar> vector of vectors*
[19:22:01] <Simplar> hmm, interesting
[19:22:04] <SuperNintendoSUX> the latter costs a lot more memory and only recommended for sparse matrices

[19:22:09] <Raziel> Simplar, you can pass it exactly the same as a non-dynamic array https://wandbox.org/permlink/s11z2AVgx1sMDyEF

[20:58:08] <paul424> ahh it passed so it can ...
[20:59:26] <Alipha> paul424: default parameter values are just syntactic sugar. When you declare a function `virtual void foo(int bar=0);`, then you're declaring a function `virtual void foo(int);` which the caller will automatically pass in 0 for the parameter if you don't specify. So if you type `x.foo();` it is equivalent to `x.foo(0);`
[21:00:18] <paul424> with virtual functions and class inheritance hierarchy the matter complicates .... ;)
[21:00:49] <Alipha> paul424: so yes, if you want to override foo, derived classes have to declare `virtual void foo(int bar = 0);` or `virtual void foo(int bar);` or even `virtual void foo(int bar = 3);`

[22:01:49] <Simplar> cbreak: I am reading user input from the console
[22:02:03] <Simplar> and I wish to read one char, do operation with it, read next char, etc until the end of the line
[22:02:36] <cbreak> Simplar: why not use std::getline into a std::string, and process it somewhere else?
[22:02:53] <cbreak> in general it's a good idea to separate IO with logic
[22:02:58] <Simplar> I fear the time limit given by a certain task
[22:03:11] *** Joins: Hokedli (~lasliedv@gateway/tor-sasl/hokedli)
[22:03:22] <Simplar> They don't explicitly tell the time limit, but they tell if it's surpassed
[22:04:00] <Simplar> A user input on one line (!) can consist from 400k chars.
[22:04:14] <Simplar> and reading them, and processing them afterwards will be hella costy on time imo
[22:04:46] <Simplar> I have only two chars in the input: first is L, second is R
[22:04:52] <Simplar> char types*
[22:05:09] <Simplar> The example input can be LLLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLLLLRRRRRLLRLRLR<...>LRLR (400k chars)
[22:06:21] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@172.58.188.16)
[22:06:34] <Simplar> The actual task is to prepend each array index of chars that are equal to 'L' and append each array index of chars that are equal to 'R' from that input
[22:06:52] <Simplar> The output string has "0" in it by default.
[22:07:09] <Simplar> Thus, if we have, for example, an input LLRLRRR
[22:07:51] <Simplar> Then the program should output a string "4 2 1 0 3 5 6 7"

[22:12:13] *** Joins: Fault (~Fault@152.70.112.168)
[22:13:25] <Alipha> Simplar: maybe they're newlines, spaces, or tabs? cin.get(ch) doesn't ignore whitespace. use `cin >> ch` to ignore whitespace.
[22:13:39] <Alipha> or just skip the whitespace yourself manually
[22:14:11] <Simplar> cin >> ch also reads char by char?
[22:14:16] <Simplar> if ch is a char type
[22:14:47] <Alipha> yes, but skips whitespace

[22:15:32] <Simplar> Alipha: when doing cin like this, there is no way to get char position in the input, correct?
[22:15:36] *** Joins: kraa (~kraa@107-190-7-216.cpe.teksavvy.com)
[22:15:40] <Simplar> I should declare int i and do i++

[22:16:36] *** Quits: Fault (~Fault@152.70.112.168) (Client Quit)
[22:16:39] <cbreak> I'd not use int. unsigned, or better size_t, is more scalable. Unless you know you never need more than 32k
[22:16:53] <cbreak> or you write hardware-specific code
[22:16:54] *** Joins: Fault (~Fault@152.70.112.168)
[22:16:56] <Simplar> cbreak: max positions by the problem is 400k
[22:17:07] <cbreak> yeah, then better not use int
[22:17:16] <cbreak> uint32_t, size_t, better alternatives
[22:17:18] <Simplar> so size_t is better?
[22:17:41] <Alipha> well, size_t could potentially also be 16-bit :-)
[22:17:53] <cbreak> chances are size_t is big enough. More than big enough.
[22:18:01] <cbreak> uint32_t will be big enough, guaranteed
[22:18:08] <cbreak> if it exists :)
[22:18:18] <Simplar> aight :)
[22:18:22] <Alipha> unsigned long would be guaranteed to be big enough

[22:19:36] <Simplar> picture = to_string(i+1)+' '+picture;
[22:19:38] <Alipha> uint32_t is most appropriate
[22:19:48] <Simplar> is there a better way to prepend a number to a string?
[22:20:10] <Simplar> if my number is uint32_t
[22:21:49] *** Joins: pah (~pah@user/pah)
[22:22:38] <cbreak> Simplar: how about a std::deque<uint32_t>
[22:22:45] <cbreak> and then create a string out of it later?
[22:22:58] <cbreak> that will save you a lot of time on allocating / reallocating
[22:23:01] <Simplar> are you kidding me X"D
[22:23:35] <cbreak> deque is optimized for insertion at both ends
[22:23:39] *** Quits: msk (~msk@185.124.240.174) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:23:47] <cbreak> it is much more efficient than prepending to a string
[22:23:59] <Simplar> and conversion of deque to string?
[22:24:02] <Simplar> in cout
[22:24:12] <Simplar> I'll sure try deque out
[22:24:19] <cbreak> simple ranged for loop for example
[22:25:11] <Simplar> which is basically O(n) complexity
[22:25:34] <cbreak> you will not be faster than O(n) ever :)

[22:29:22] <computerquip> You can search in O(1), traversal is pretty much always O(n)
[22:30:28] <Alipha> imo, I'd use std::deque<std::string> and then keep track of the sum of string lengths so that you can reserve the final string to the correct length when you build it.

[22:37:33] <Alipha> fine. do math :-P
[22:38:39] <Alipha> you're having to use std::to_string on each of the numbers at some point anyway, so it probably doesn't make much of a difference if you do it before you put them in the std::deque or after you take them out
