[01:05:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> xD-: Yeah, I'm just hoping they release the cracking code in a branch everyone can just rebase on-top of youtube-dlp (main) and have it work.
[01:05:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The way they made their program should make that feasible with next to no conflicts. I checked.
[01:05:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They dynamically load all modules included in a certain file, so you just add a few more includes and that's all.

[01:27:37] <xD-> na there are probe cards

[01:27:53] <ImoutoBot> [application/pdf] 3.3MB
[01:28:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah, so a PCIe signal duplicator.
[01:28:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Huh. neat
[01:28:22] <xD-> yeah but expensive
[01:28:31] <xD-> but this option is always open :)
[01:28:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Expensive for now.
[01:29:49] <xD-> but the h264 frame must go through there before decoding?
[01:29:50] <xD-> xD
[01:29:52] <xD-> who knows
[01:30:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> xD-: Oh, that looks like a proper one-module analyzer, of course those would be unaffordable.
[01:30:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I meant more like having a plug-in card that you plug the GPU into, and its duplicate output goes into a second PCIe card that essentially gives you the equivalent of PCIe pcap
[01:30:51] <xD-> dunno used 4-5k euro
[01:31:05] <xD-> so it is not unaffordable
[01:31:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So you just record everything and then after you're done with playback, you can just convert & extract in software.
[01:31:42] <xD-> but probably cheaper to build own
[01:31:45] <xD-> cant be that hard
[01:31:46] <xD-> :P
[01:32:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The main issue is speed.
[01:32:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Assuming the GPU/trusted-module uses the entirety of a maximum-size lane's bandwidth, anyway.
[01:32:54] <xD-> you connect all lanes to differential input of a midrange fpga
[01:32:56] <xD-> process data
[01:33:04] <xD-> it is doable
[01:33:04] <xD-> :P
[01:33:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah but FPGAs are also stupidly expensive. If I can buy a lada for the cost, it's too much.
[01:33:27] <xD-> not really
[01:33:51] <xD-> the ide is expensive
[01:33:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> xD-: My objective with this idea is something random consumers/prosumers could put in their LAN
[01:34:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> 5kEU is way too expensive. Even 1k.
[01:34:31] <xD-> yeah true
[01:34:35] <xD-> and no guarantee it works
[01:35:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Having two plugin cards that just produce an output you can read from an emulated block device capture means you can offload most of the cost & processing onto conventional hardware & software later.
[01:36:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Though I suppose restricting the card to a x8 lane, with PCIe3 or PCIe4 would still be more than fast enough for 4k video and you could put the capture card on a PCIe x16
[01:37:02] <xD-> hehe
[01:37:22] <xD-> maybe you can even restrict it to 4x
[01:37:32] <xD-> x4
[01:37:41] <xD-> but no idea
[01:37:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That'd be for the best, consumer motherboards have a depressingly low number of large lanes.

[11:13:05] <amigojapan> blue_rog: were you actually married?
[11:13:34] <amigojapan> Hey Jesse
[11:16:09] <blue_rog> no amigojapan 
[11:16:17] <blue_rog> not married, but we really liked each other
[11:16:37] <amigojapan> blue_rog: how long were you together?
[11:17:12] <blue_rog> we were in the same uni, but she was a year younger than me. we were always around each other and i would say 1.5 years
[11:17:32] <blue_rog> but it was like constant being around each other. like 24hrs a day
[11:17:57] <blue_rog> i don't want it to sound too cliche, but it hurts more because the guy she got with is one of my good friends
[11:17:58] <amigojapan> blue_rog: I think you will eventually get over it then
[11:18:34] <amigojapan> Ouch blue_rog that does hurt
[11:18:36] <blue_rog> I really hope so amigojapan, i really do. i feel like my heart is in my mouth and i really want to puke. it's stomach wrenching
[11:19:03] <blue_rog> but, i'm not mad at them. it's their life and we had broken up a few months ago
[11:19:29] <blue_rog> i don't harbor ill feelings, but it's just really, really hard for me to accept
[11:19:48] <amigojapan> blue_rog: altho to be honest I never officially went out with anyone other than tomako. So I lack such an experience
[11:19:57] <blue_rog> that's really nice to hear
[11:20:11] <blue_rog> i would never wish for you to experience this
[11:20:31] <blue_rog> i wish you a lifetime of happiness with tomako
[11:20:47] <amigojapan> Yeah after 19 years of marriage it would definitely wreck me
[11:21:13] <blue_rog> 19 years?! That's amazing!
[11:21:19] <amigojapan> Yeah
[11:21:34] <amigojapan> Time flies by
[11:21:48] <blue_rog> i need to find a pastime 
[11:21:59] <blue_rog> i want to bicycle, but it is too hot outside for me
[11:22:43] <amigojapan> I like bicycling
[11:23:28] <blue_rog> i recently bought a really nice bicycle
[11:23:38] <blue_rog> and i couldn't test it out well because it started raining a lot
[11:23:44] <blue_rog> but now it's too hot
[11:23:51] <blue_rog> i think i'm making excuses lol
[11:24:24] <blue_rog> do you bicycle often amigojapan?
[11:24:44] <amigojapan> blue_rog: when I lived in Florida there was a Japanese girl I liked, but I asked her to go out with me several times and she rejected, and she started going out with my roommate. I guess that is the closest experience I have
[11:25:28] <blue_rog> Although, you got married with Tomako in the end, so that sounds like a bigggg win to me
[11:25:57] <amigojapan> blue_rog: my bicycle was wrecked after someone stole it. The cops found it but it was a wreck
[11:26:42] <amigojapan> Yeah blue_rog . It is all just an anecdote from the past to me now. So it will be for you
[11:26:43] <blue_rog> :( that sounds terrible. I hope it wasn't too expensive / something personal. 
[11:27:05] <blue_rog> amigojapan: thank you :) it means a lot just to have someone to say something to
[11:27:18] <amigojapan> blue_rog: when I bought the bike it costed 500usd
[11:27:36] <blue_rog> WOW that's expensive 
[11:27:41] <amigojapan> Sure blue_rog I am here for you bud
[11:28:17] <amigojapan> blue_rog: it is a thick wheels mountain bike
[11:28:19] <blue_rog> My bicycle was bought for ~450USD so I'd feel terrible if it was wrecked

[12:56:37] <DunceCotus> I forgot you can't pirate in japan
[12:56:44] <amigojapan> Yup
[12:56:49] <DunceCotus> would be incredibly easy to do so
[12:56:55] <amigojapan> Yup
[12:57:33] <amigojapan> It's ok. I'll get the legal one
[12:58:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's seven books, feels worth it
[12:59:20] <amigojapan> Altho you told me only the first four are any good
[12:59:20] <DunceCotus> you're just putting more pennies into the pocket of a multi-millionaire
[12:59:47] <DunceCotus> keep in mind that people without money in this world can easily become destitute
[12:59:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: don't know how to get around it legally
[13:00:09] <DunceCotus> some laws need breaking
[13:00:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: breaking the law puts my future in danger
[13:01:40] <DunceCotus> everyone's future is in danger
[13:01:58] <DunceCotus> IP law is the danger
[13:02:08] <amigojapan> But I don't need to take wreckless risks
[13:02:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they have bigger fish to fry
[13:02:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe if I had a seed box in another country
[13:02:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: how many pirates do you see actually getting caught?
[13:02:48] <DunceCotus> SEED BOX
[13:03:26] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they have shown people getting arrested for piracy in the news, the first guy was laughing
[13:04:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: paid actors
[13:04:19] <amigojapan> Nah
[13:04:23] <DunceCotus> unpaid actors
[13:04:30] <amigojapan> Nah
[13:04:41] <DunceCotus> unpaid real people
[13:05:02] <amigojapan> Yup
[13:05:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: i'm sipping on bone broth
[13:05:30] <DunceCotus> apparently its healthy
[13:05:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I am also going to buy the manga tomako wants, that is not that much
[13:05:57] <DunceCotus> its good to know not even the animal's bone goes to waste
[13:06:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I see
[13:06:22] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: does it taste like soup?
[13:06:34] <DunceCotus> it tastes like meat and bone flavoured water
[13:06:43] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:07:03] <amigojapan> Is it chicken?
[13:07:52] <DunceCotus> beef
[13:07:58] <amigojapan> Oh
[13:08:05] <amigojapan> Nice
[13:08:09] <DunceCotus> solid beefiness
[13:08:18] <amigojapan> Very nice
[13:08:24] <DunceCotus> they put too much yeast extract in it perhaps
[13:08:29] <DunceCotus> probably to make it more flavourful
[13:08:57] <amigojapan> Oh I thought you had boiled bones
[13:09:01] <DunceCotus> lol
[13:09:11] <DunceCotus> no just powdered stuff
[13:09:18] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[13:09:23] <DunceCotus> cause it has to be slow-cooked for 24-48 hours
[13:09:27] <DunceCotus> and I don't have time for that sheeeit
[13:09:38] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[13:12:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I also had to pay an extra months rent cause of the rent contact update
[13:12:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: WTF
[13:12:31] <amigojapan> It's normal in Japan
[13:12:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its cruel and unusual punishment
[13:12:55] <amigojapan> When the contract expires, you pay an extra months rent to renew it
[13:13:06] <DunceCotus> that's totally bricked
[13:13:10] <amigojapan> Definitely DunceCotus 
[13:13:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: how do people afford it?
[13:13:52] <DunceCotus> rent is already too damn high
[13:14:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they also require several months rent when you move into a new place
[13:14:22] <DunceCotus> here you have to pay for first month's rent up-front
[13:14:25] <DunceCotus> but not several months
[13:14:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: up to now we have afforded it. But been in red digits
[13:15:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's not a deposit. It's money you never get back. You also need to pay a deposit
[13:15:50] <DunceCotus> WTF
[13:16:01] <DunceCotus> japan sounds super expensive
[13:16:10] <amigojapan> It is
[13:16:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's better to keep moving house to a minimum

[13:24:33] <DunceCotus> why don't japanese people complain
[13:24:38] <DunceCotus> get some renter's rights
[13:25:14] <amigojapan> Japanese people are bad at complaining
[13:25:26] <DunceCotus> its a skill sure
[13:25:44] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is why they need to do unpaid overtime all the time
[13:26:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we always get paid for overtime
[13:26:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: anyone can avoid unpaid overtime by complaining about it too the work standards dependent, but few people do that
[13:26:56] <DunceCotus> even if its not at bonus rates
[13:27:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: risk of termination?
[13:27:56] <amigojapan> Not sure. Probably you can sue them if they terminate you for that
[13:28:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I know one Japanese guy that works only 9-5 because he actually went and complained
[13:29:15] <DunceCotus> so why don't more people complain?
[13:29:20] <DunceCotus> must be some downside to it
[13:29:42] <amigojapan> Probably they don't know you can actually do it
[13:30:32] <amigojapan> Lack of information
[13:30:52] <amigojapan> Everyone is doing the over time
[13:31:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you are also not supposed to go home until your sempais go home. That is a social rule
[13:32:10] <theholyduck> Also I imagine if you do it torpedoes your career opportunities for climbing the ladder
[13:32:12] <DunceCotus> maybe in feudal japan that makes sense
[13:32:18] <DunceCotus> but in capitalism that's nuts
[13:32:42] <theholyduck> Just because you can say no in theory
[13:32:42] <amigojapan> It's definitely nuts
[13:32:59] <amigojapan> theholyduck: that is likely
[13:33:00] <theholyduck> Doesn't mean saying no wont have a negative impact for you
[13:33:18] <DunceCotus> so how can they say no
[13:34:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they do to a beuro that takes care of workers rights, but few people go
[13:34:14] <amigojapan> They go

[13:34:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: right
[13:35:18] <amigojapan> That is a hard word to spell
[13:36:02] <DunceCotus> as a 9 year old I would have agreed
[13:36:31] <DunceCotus> its certainly non-standard, not that anything in english is standard
[13:36:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I never studied English writing
[13:37:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I see
[13:38:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I had trouble speaking growing up, needed a speech therapist
[13:39:06] <DunceCotus> I still think I'd benefit from one now
[13:39:27] <DunceCotus> elocution me up
[13:39:52] <DunceCotus> tendency to trip over my own mouth sounds
[13:39:55] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: my dad spoke English with me when I was a kid. But he never taught me how to write. That I learned on IRC
[13:40:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: good job
[13:40:31] <amigojapan> Ty
[13:40:44] <DunceCotus> so many multilingual people
[13:40:47] <Cryowolf> I learned most of my English by being self-taught, by the time they started teaching english in school I was at a high school level (at age 9)
[13:40:49] <DunceCotus> and i'm like struggling with one language
[13:41:15] <amigojapan> Very nice Cryowolf 
[13:41:21] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: savant
[13:41:32] <Cryowolf> I wish I had spent time learning more languages as a child
[13:41:36] <Cryowolf> so much easier to learn then
[13:42:33] <DunceCotus> easier for some
[13:42:38] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, not quite that well. I wish I was an artistic savant, as long as I don't have to sacrifice my creativity for it cause then it would be pointless to know how to draw
[13:42:42] <DunceCotus> I learned piano as a child, was terrible
[13:42:45] <Cryowolf> and I mean draw like a king
[13:43:09] <Cryowolf> If you can type on a keyboard you can learn the piano now
[13:43:21] <Cryowolf> it's all about muscle memory
[13:43:38] <Cryowolf> building up that muscle memory to know where each key is and what sound it produces
[13:43:45] <DunceCotus> its about practice 
[13:43:49] <DunceCotus> and I didn't like to practice
[13:43:58] <DunceCotus> a kid needs discipline to learn well
[13:43:59] <Cryowolf> yes you have to practice to build muscle memory
[13:44:11] <Cryowolf> I didnt have much discipline as a child
[13:44:18] <DunceCotus> either that or savantdom
[13:44:29] <Cryowolf> learning English was mostly passive for me, watching English cartoons etc
[13:44:33] <Cryowolf> and playing English games
[13:44:47] <DunceCotus> I see
[13:44:50] <Cryowolf> things just sort of connected
[13:45:04] <Cryowolf> and I learned it by just doing nothing :P
[13:46:02] <Cryowolf> then I got started chatting online at age 12 when I got my first PC and that's when I started learning really really fast and a ton cause I had to communicate ^^ The best way to learn a language is to learn to think in that language
[13:46:21] <Cryowolf> If you can think and process information in the language you're learning, it'll become much easier and much quicker

[13:47:18] <Cryowolf> nah it's just that you have no real need for it, while much of the rest of the world does
[13:47:31] <Cryowolf> so we have to learn English
[13:47:40] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: and they close at 8pm
[13:47:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: seems a bit why
[13:47:57] <Cryowolf> but you dont have to learn anything cause you can get by with the one language you know

[13:53:33] <DunceCotus> why no alcohol?

[13:55:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: beliefs are there to be shattered
[13:56:01] <Cryowolf> small apartments here in Sweden tend to have tables anchored to the wall that when you pull it down, the legs automatically move into place
[13:56:08] <Cryowolf> but they dont come with the apartment
[13:56:15] <Cryowolf> but to save space, people do that
[13:56:23] <amigojapan> I see
[13:56:42] <Cryowolf> many also create an alcove near the roof to sleep if it's a small apartment and then they have a couch or something underneat
[13:57:10] <Cryowolf> I did that with an ikea bed that was high rise, then I had my desk and computer underneath
[13:57:17] <Cryowolf> saved so much space

[14:00:05] <Cryowolf> If I got to live like in the middle of Tokyo at an affordable price, I wouldn't mind if it was really small cause I could be smart about it
[14:00:31] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, can you ask for permission to do it? Like a signed contract to do something
[14:00:48] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: there are even places for 100usd per month in Tokyo
[14:00:58] <Cryowolf> and when youre not allowed to do any construction, does that include drill into the wall to hang things on the wall etc?

[14:12:40] <Cryowolf> it all just makes text
[14:20:17] <sscout> your client may strip background colour codes
[14:20:22] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: some IRC clients don't offer the option of changing the background colour
[14:20:34] <sscout> 3,11 like this
[14:20:44] <Cryowolf> that's very annoyingif this doesn't cause it's the closest I've ever found to mirc
[14:20:55] <Cryowolf> sscout, what''s the shortcut for background for you?
[14:21:09] <sscout> if you didn't see the like green on my last message it's your client
[14:21:14] <Cryowolf> I saw it
[14:21:26] <sscout> ctrl+k colour, bg colour
[14:21:40] <Cryowolf> huh?
[14:21:43] <sscout> 4,13 this is 4,13
[14:21:57] <Cryowolf> do Ihave to say bg colour?
[14:22:04] <sscout> 6,10 this is 6,10
[14:22:20] <Cryowolf> 9,9 hmm
[14:22:23] <Cryowolf> ah there we go
[14:22:24] <sscout> no, it's codes, 0..15
[14:22:25] <Cryowolf> thank you
[14:22:30] <sscout> np
[14:22:36] <amigojapan> No Cryowolf that is a number. But it is client dependent
[14:22:44] <Cryowolf> no it works now
[14:22:54] <Cryowolf> I just had to be reminded of how it worked
[14:22:56] <amigojapan> Ah cool
[14:23:31] <Cryowolf> ctrl-shift-k is a lot more complicated with more adjustment on the color
[14:23:45] <Cryowolf> anyway I was gonna write soemthing spoilerish but now I forgot what it was
[14:24:04] <Cryowolf> I solved an issue tho and can freely spoiler mark now! ;D
[14:24:12] <amigojapan> Something about sonny boy
[14:24:19] <Cryowolf> yes
[14:24:41] <Cryowolf> ah yes
[14:24:54] <DunceCotus> 6,1 this is not a spoiler
[14:25:23] <DunceCotus> redacted for spoilerjunkies
[14:26:03] <Cryowolf> 3,3 The reason he became a dog is because she needed a companion and she wished for him to be a dog. She controlled everything in that world, so it's possible she made him a dog, or he made himself one because he had created the world which is why he was immune to the crystal disease
[14:26:28] <Cryowolf> 3,3
[14:26:40] <Cryowolf> 3,3 he became a dog for her
[14:27:34] <DunceCotus> 1,1so he created the world, so its like Nagara?
[14:28:13] <Cryowolf> 3,3 no I think that everyone has a world they created, but Nagara can move between them at will
[14:28:57] <Cryowolf> 3,3 I forgot which episode but there was one where they moved to a world where one of the girls solved some puzzle immediately, as if she understood everything. Perhaps that was her world
[14:29:18] <DunceCotus> 1,1ah interesting
[14:29:40] <Cryowolf> just my guess
[14:29:48] <Cryowolf> based on what happened
[14:30:38] <DunceCotus> fun show.
[14:30:49] <Cryowolf> it's really weird and original
[14:30:54] <Cryowolf> I like it
[14:31:19] <Cryowolf> kinda like the monogatari series
[14:31:31] <Cryowolf> which has a lot of really weird shoes
[14:31:33] <Cryowolf> shows*
[14:33:51] <DunceCotus> i'll check it out, thanks
[14:34:10] <Cryowolf> it has a ton of shows and I forgot which order is best to watch them
[14:34:25] <Cryowolf> they all take place in the same universe, but some of them are very bizzarre
[14:35:07] <DunceCotus> looks haruhi-esque
[14:35:50] <Cryowolf> the order is very often the source of arguments, some say to watch the anime shows in release order, other add them in the in-world timeline order
[14:36:15] <DunceCotus> that sounds very haruhi

[14:49:26] <lastonestanding> are japanese white or people of color?
[14:49:46] <Cryowolf> I don't see the world like that, it's a very American way to see things
[14:49:53] <lastonestanding> it is
[14:49:56] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: they call themes "the yellow race
[14:50:01] <darkwitch> even white people have color
[14:50:31] <lastonestanding> "The Chinese were white – until white men called them yellow"
[14:50:32] <Cryowolf> in Europe we distinguish by facial features that often reveals the ethnic group you're from
[14:50:35] <Cryowolf> even if you're white
[14:51:32] <lastonestanding> Marge Simpson has yellow skin and a blue afro, yet she's white
[14:51:41] <lastonestanding> that is very confusing
[14:51:52] <Cryowolf> and if someone isn't white we don't really give a damn. What Swedes tend to discriminate about is if you "act Swedish"
[14:52:24] <Cryowolf> it's not about the color of your skin or where you're from, it's about being able to embrace our cultural values and such and "act Swedish"
[14:52:26] <lastonestanding> having a different culture is hated on?
[14:52:30] <lastonestanding> in Sweden
[14:52:52] <Cryowolf> no, you can have another culture but I think if you move to another country you need to adapt to the majority culture there
[14:52:57] <Cryowolf> and then introduce your own culture
[14:53:01] <Cryowolf> to everyone else
[14:53:22] <lastonestanding> and how do you balance both sides?
[14:53:29] <Cryowolf> so you can first learn to understand how the country works, why people think or feel the way they do and so on
[14:53:37] <Cryowolf> this is how I and many Swedes feel
[14:53:45] <Cryowolf> well you don't balance. Sweden is Sweden
[14:54:16] <Cryowolf> You can have your own culture, but it's not here to replace or be the majority culture and such

[14:56:49] <Cryowolf> so I can't embrace a culture that would do that

[14:57:25] <lastonestanding> that would be failed integration
[14:57:29] <Cryowolf> bad politics, poor planning, poor execution and mass immigration with no plan of integration or teaching the immigrants about Sweden
[14:57:47] <Cryowolf> Instead they put them all into the same areas, creating parallel societies
[14:57:56] <lastonestanding> that is bad
[14:58:06] <Cryowolf> where sometimes 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants that are now Swedish, can't speak Swedish
[14:58:15] <Cryowolf> and yes that is very bad
[14:58:23] <Cryowolf> and it's the governments fault
[14:58:53] <Cryowolf> they wanted to have so much solidarity and be so virtuous that they forgot to plan ahead and be pragmatic etc
[14:59:05] <DunceCotus> what IS a 'class rep'?
[14:59:21] <Cryowolf> I don't blame any immigrant or refuge for this, it's not their fault our government screwed up
[14:59:50] <Cryowolf> but if they join a gang and commit crimes, it is their fault. Though that fault is shared by the government for placing them in such a vulnerable position to begin with
[14:59:53] <darkwitch> someone who reps the class
[14:59:54] <lastonestanding> isn't it their fault for going to a place which culturally very different?
[15:00:06] <lastonestanding> and far away
[15:00:15] <Cryowolf> lastonestanding, not if theyre refugees. Yes if they are immigrants
[15:00:51] <Cryowolf> but even refugees need to learn about Swedens culture, values, laws and such. It's very important when you come to a new country
[15:00:54] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I would not reject an entire culture just cause it has some bad parts, it probably has done good parts too

[15:02:27] <amigojapan> Alright
[15:03:01] <Cryowolf> I judge on individual basis
[15:03:10] <amigojapan> I see
[15:03:15] <Cryowolf> what each person does and who they are
[15:03:29] <amigojapan> That's good

[15:05:17] <lastonestanding> "With a rapidly ageing population, Japan has opened up its immigration policies to fill an acute labour shortage. In 2018 the government signed a bill to allow for hundreds of thousands of workers to come to Japan to work in specific sectors such as construction, nursing and farming."
[15:05:40] <amigojapan> Well skin colour does not really say anything about the person
[15:06:06] <DunceCotus> judging people doesn't get us anywhere
[15:07:20] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, nope, which is why I'm always very confused by how much emphasis Americans put on it
[15:08:03] <lastonestanding> because the non-white people are growing in numbers I think
[15:08:18] <lastonestanding> and the whites are afraid
[15:08:20] <DunceCotus> anon-white
[15:08:39] <Cryowolf> lastonestanding, therer are people who think that way and then there's the opposite
[15:08:42] <lastonestanding> afraid of becoming the minority I mean
[15:09:21] <Cryowolf> I'm confused by both
[15:09:41] <Cryowolf> as long as my culture remains intact, I don't really care
[15:10:11] <Cryowolf> think of it like my culture being in the middle and then you can draw lines out from it that attaches other cultures
[15:10:27] <Cryowolf> cultures I've embraced and been influenced by
[15:11:05] <Cryowolf> but at the core of it all, I still want my culture to remain. Of course it changes as time goes by, but a change is not the same as erasure
[15:12:49] <Cryowolf> I don't fear change and I don't think it's realistic to expect erasure. Right now the realistic outlook is that parallel societies have formed that don't consider themselves a part of Sweden and have their own laws illegally enforced. This is the result of poor management by our government
[15:13:02] <Cryowolf> they did this
[15:14:14] <Cryowolf> It's very unfortunate because if they had handled it better, I think it could've resulted in a very nice cultural exchange

[15:19:23] <Cryowolf> that's one yes
[15:19:59] <amigojapan> I don't know any other cultures that brings a legal system with it
[15:20:46] <Cryowolf> many "problem areas" have sharia laws that they enforce on the people that live there that are muslim. And since the government sent every single muslim into a single neighbourhood, the refugees have now been sent to an area that functions the exact same way as the one they fled from
[15:21:14] <Cryowolf> or well not just one, many, but they have areas where they sort of "dump" them
[15:21:18] <amigojapan> I see
[15:21:26] <Cryowolf> and eventually they're like 99% or 100% muslim
[15:21:56] <Cryowolf> and effectively become a parallel society with underground and illegal enforcers of Sharia law
[15:22:21] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: technically they could complain to Swedish law which would declare the be Sharia law illegal
[15:23:09] <Cryowolf> they're afraid to, the enforcers aren't above making them disappear, or going after their family back in their country

[15:24:30] <amigojapan> Ouch :(
[15:24:43] <Cryowolf> There's also many that embrace it, because they now live in a country on welfare, speaking their native language, living with the laws they're comfortable with and don't consider the area they live in to be Sweden

[16:08:53] <tyawp> I am recently thinking that try mahjong because of Saki that was mentioned last night.
[16:09:15] <Cryowolf> there's something written in german. or something.Gebrauchsanweisun Beachten
[16:09:44] <amigojapan> tyawp: I prefer Hanafuda
[16:09:44] <dfch> basically follow the instructions, lol
[16:09:45] <Cryowolf> and there's a thing I can lift and rotate
[16:09:53] <Cryowolf> it didnt come with instructions
[16:10:01] <Cryowolf> it was a bankrupcy sale
[16:10:20] <Cryowolf> it was sold at like 80% discount
[16:10:24] <Cryowolf> but with no manual
[16:10:30] <tyawp> amigojapan: Hanafuda's fun too but no one can play it around me when I was in Kyoto.
[16:10:39] <dfch> gebrauchsanweisung - basically instruction to use
[16:10:43] <darkwitch> for a long time I thought mahjong was a game where you matched pairs of tiles
[16:10:55] <Cryowolf> dfch, oh
[16:10:59] <Cryowolf> thank you
[16:11:02] <Cryowolf> the other one?
[16:11:02] <amigojapan> tyawp: there are apps. And I have played with tomako
[16:11:28] <tyawp> amigojapan: oh nice, what app do you play?
[16:11:31] <dfch> to observe?
[16:11:50] <theholyduck> darkwitch: lol

[16:12:31] <darkwitch> theholyduck, hey the phone apps still do that
[16:12:40] <tyawp> darkwitch: mahjong is basically a poker that is more complex, I think.
[16:12:40] <dfch> Cryowolf, seriously though, pressure cookers are simple, check the link I shared above
[16:12:43] <theholyduck> darkwitch: i used to play riichii mahjong games in like 2007

[16:13:18] <amigojapan> tyawp: maybe it was "koikoi"

[16:15:25] <theholyduck> gin rummy?
[16:15:26] <theholyduck> brainfart
[16:15:32] <Shinra> most popular web based mahjong would be Mahjong Soul for the western audience
[16:15:37] <tyawp> tyawp: and yes, I'm a free software nerd :)
[16:15:41] <amigojapan> tyawp: ok I will try to find a web based one
[16:15:41] <darkwitch> don't mix gin and rum
[16:15:45] <theholyduck> i think i just mean regular rummy
[16:15:52] <theholyduck> gin rummy is the 2 person version of the game
[16:15:59] <Shinra> Mahjong Soul uses anime girls for avatars
[16:16:01] <tyawp> amigojapan: thanks, I'll search for it too
[16:16:28] <theholyduck> Shinra:  what about tenhou?
[16:16:32] <Shinra> tenhou.net is the biggest in japan for sure
[16:16:37] <theholyduck> it was like the place to go play 1like 12 years ago
[16:16:42] <Shinra> but you need to use a translator plugin
[16:16:42] <theholyduck> i only ever played on tenhou
[16:16:45] <theholyduck> you dont
[16:16:50] <Shinra> ah
[16:16:52] <Shinra> you used to
[16:16:54] <theholyduck> you just need to know what all the mahjong words are in japanese
[16:16:59] <theholyduck> or how they look like
[16:17:01] <Shinra> oh well there's that
[16:17:09] <Shinra> but I mean the site itself is Japanese
[16:17:12] <theholyduck> oh sure
[16:17:22] <theholyduck> but like 15 year old duck who could not read a lick of japanese
[16:17:26] <Shinra> it's not as widely played as mahjong soul outside of japan
[16:17:28] <theholyduck> was able to play on tenhou just fine
[16:17:35] <tyawp> Shinra: what I think to play it that site, tenhou.net
[16:17:40] <theholyduck> i learned how to play on tenhou from a guide somebody posted on 4chan/a/
[16:17:50] <tyawp> Shinra: is that good site for a newbie?
[16:17:55] <theholyduck> that showed the like symbols for the various things you cared about
[16:18:10] <theholyduck> like how to join a game 
[16:18:13] <Shinra> you'd need a guide to learn to play
[16:18:20] <Shinra> it's got some rules that take getting used to
[16:18:41] <tyawp> like ura-dora or something like that?
[16:18:45] <Shinra> Mahjong Soul would be more user friendly for you
[16:18:46] <Shinra> as a newbie
[16:18:49] <theholyduck> i used the official riichi association rule book 
[16:18:54] <theholyduck> back in the day 
[16:18:59] <theholyduck> it was well written
[16:19:12] <theholyduck> and i printed out a bunch of copies to take with me when i played
[16:19:21] <Shinra> kemono mahjong is the most newbie friendly of all but it's $5 on steam and android
[16:19:54] <tyawp> >kemono mahjong is that something related with Kemono Friends?
[16:20:07] <Shinra> nah but it does use monster people for avatars

[21:14:09] <Guest78> it doesn't matter what others think
[21:14:11] <Guest78> you be you
[21:14:15] <Guest78> and don't forget it!
[21:14:32] <ButterNoodle> you seem to care a lot about what I think.. want to go out for dinner sometime?
[21:14:41] <Guest78> just remember to have self-respect and wake up in the mornings and look in the mirror and say 
[21:14:47] <Guest78> "I am good"
[21:14:48] <Bco1981> producing 305 hp and 280lb-ft of torque, sounds like fun
[21:15:21] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: its not a new one..
[21:15:33] <Bco1981> a classic ?
[21:15:34] <ButterNoodle> the new eco boost v6's arent terrible
[21:15:42] <ButterNoodle> naaa like a 2004
[21:15:46] <Guest78> haha 2004
[21:16:05] <ButterNoodle> the new v6's have as much hp as my old gt
[21:16:36] <Bco1981> hmm a 2004 don't look so nice.
[21:16:37] <Guest78> you should get a tesla
[21:16:45] <Guest78> it's electric
[21:16:46] <ButterNoodle> naa they arent great
[21:17:20] <Guest78> wtf
[21:17:21] <ButterNoodle> I'd like a new toy tbh.. but car prices with everyone getting free money here, has been inflated quite a bit
[21:17:45] <Guest78> elon musk invented the tesla
[21:18:02] <ButterNoodle> I was looking for a 2012 gt.. and they are about 4K more than they were 2 years ago
[21:18:21] <Guest78> just looked up pics of that
[21:18:26] <Guest78> looks like a car batman would drive
[21:18:40] <Bco1981> i'm not having a electric car until, they can atleast last 700km, in the winter with heater on full blast, and music at full blast... if it can't replace my curren't car... i'm nut having it,
[21:19:01] <Guest78> i think a tesla can do all that
[21:19:08] <ButterNoodle> I'd have an electric bike.. they are getting close
[21:19:19] <Guest78> even electric scouters
[21:20:14] <Guest78> you can also take the bus and save CO2 emissions
[21:20:22] <Bco1981> and. i'm not having some full pc monitor sticking out of the dashboard. that looks so fucking stupid.
[21:20:44] <Guest78> are you kidding? you can watch TV
[21:20:58] <Bco1981> i don't need that when i'm driving
[21:21:03] <Guest78> i see
[21:21:05] <Bco1981> and it looks stupid.
[21:21:18] <Guest78> function over athestics
[21:21:23] <Bco1981> and it looks stupid.
[21:21:38] <ButterNoodle> https://youtu.be/vlxZs2-gICc <- they have gotten better since this even Bco1981
[21:21:39] <ImoutoBot> [title] John McGuinness breaks the TT Zero lap record! TT 2014 - Mugen Shinden - On Bike - HD - YouTube
[21:22:11] <ButterNoodle> there are some parts that the electrics go faster than the open class super sports
[21:22:27] <Guest78> nice
[21:23:30] <ButterNoodle> too bad they dont have the telemetry on screen.. I think his top speed was well over 200
[21:23:46] <Bco1981> sounds so futuristic when it accelerates
[21:24:15] <ButterNoodle> ik.. they sound spooky compared to the litre bikes
[21:25:34] <ButterNoodle> with the advanced electronic management systems.. all u have to do is brake, turn, and pin the throttle I bet
[21:26:44] <Bco1981> turn the throttle as much as you dare.
[21:27:00] <ButterNoodle> top speed @ 6 min mark
[21:28:36] <ButterNoodle> I do like the 100% torque at any rpm..
[21:29:14] <Bco1981> but... there isn't any rpm.

[21:29:22] <ButterNoodle> yes
[21:29:28] <ButterNoodle> electric motors turn :)
[21:30:20] <ButterNoodle> I actually planned to see the tt in 2020 :|
[21:30:28] <Bco1981> ah, i was thinking when standing still.
[21:30:46] <ButterNoodle> but covid..
[21:31:14] <ButterNoodle> 100% torque as soon as you turn it on :3
