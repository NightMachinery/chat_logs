[17:44:44] <shapr> Ok, I'm back for questions.
[17:46:07] <shapr> I have a git repo that has multiple packages in subdirectories. Should I have a single top level hie.yaml or one in each subdirectory?
[17:48:27] <michaelpj[m]> shapr: a) these days you shouldn't need to write a hie.yaml unless something goes wrong, b) you should just need one
[18:00:53] <shapr> ok, I'll try 1. removing all the hie.yaml files
[18:01:04] <shapr> if that doesn't work I'll try creating one at the top level
[18:01:04] <shapr> thanks

[20:00:08] <shapr> should gen-hie recognize a cabal.project file in a parent directory? When I run "gen-hie > hie.yaml" I get "No .cabal files found under/home/shae/build/morpheus-graphql"
[20:02:53] <fendor[m]> no it doesn't
[20:04:27] *** Joins: fendor (~fendor@77.119.169.94.wireless.dyn.drei.com)
[20:06:22] <shapr> might be easier to get rid of my attempts to make this a cabal-only project and just go back to stack
[20:07:09] <shapr> fendor: is there a way to generate a hie.yaml in a parent directory that has a bunch of packages in subdirectories?
[20:07:16] <shapr> send more money to the HLS foundation? :-D
[20:07:32] <fendor> write a simple cabal project `cradle: { cabal: }`
[20:07:43] <shapr> oh!
[20:07:51] <fendor> cabal is smart enough to figure out everything
[20:07:55] <fendor> but implicit-hie is not smart enough
[20:08:22] <shapr> THAT WAS IT!
[20:08:25] * shapr dances cheerfully
[20:08:32] <shapr> fendor: you know all the magic!
[20:09:06] <fendor> awesome!
[20:09:13] <fendor> I know most of the session loading magic :D
[20:09:51] <shapr> I'm writing that into my notes so I won't forget it.
[20:10:02] <fendor> incredible, matrix has an almost two minute delay when relaying messages from irc...
[20:10:39] <fendor> yeah, it fill be fixed for implicit-hie, too, once we get: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2342 
[20:11:01] <fendor> (or remove implicit-hie altogether because it is subsumed by the build-tools)
[20:11:09] <shapr> that makes sense
[20:12:11] <fendor> nowadays, there is only one reason why implicit-hie might be smarter than `cradle: { cabal: }`: since it maps directories to components, it makes it possible to load files that are located in your project, but not part of any cabal component. For example example files
[20:12:31] <fendor> assuming the dependencies match up by accident
[20:13:20] <shapr> I gotta say, hls is my biggest time saver at work
[20:15:49] <fendor> a good ide is worth a lot! hopefully we can improve the stability enough that we can convice everyone that hls saves time
[20:22:52] <jneira[m]> <fendor> "a good ide is worth a lot..." <- yeah reliability is the weakest point of hls ðŸ™ƒ
[20:25:25] <shapr> What's the low hanging fruit there?
[20:25:42] <shapr> I thought the biggest constraint was template haskell, and fixing that requires GHC improvements?
[20:26:22] <shapr> At least, from my experience I suspect TH is the largest source of HLS crashes for me
[20:27:18] <michaelpj[m]> I think the big "reliability" issues in my opinion are: a) TH, b) session loading (biggest cause of "HLS doesn't work IMO), c) resource usag
[20:27:27] <fendor[m]> I dunno about low hanging fruit, but start-up issues with cabal and stack are still definitely common
[20:27:32] <michaelpj[m]> b) is probably the one we can improve most easily
[20:27:35] <michaelpj[m]> yeah, agreeing with fendor here
[20:27:42] <michaelpj[m]> better diagnostics for the user would go a long wawy
[20:28:13] <fendor> gotta finish that hls-wrapper lsp thingy, ought to improve stuff *slightly*
[20:29:23] <michaelpj[m]> yep
[20:29:48] <michaelpj[m]> I was planning to poke at some of this stuff once https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2558 lands

[20:33:38] <michaelpj[m]> maybe even push it down, e.g. we could pass a little contravariant tracer into `hie-bios` and have it log some stuff
[20:35:23] <fendor> more structured logging will make it way easier to show proper error messages to the user
[20:36:01] <michaelpj[m]> yeah, I'm also interested in feeding them into `window/logMessage` notifications so that hopefully they get surfaced better in the client
[20:36:02] <fendor> I think one issue why session loading is so terrible at the moment is the total lack of responses. Meaning, we do not communicate to the user at all
[20:36:58] <fendor> for example, just telling we tried to run `stack repl` or cabal repl and it failed would improve the UX since they could easily run it themselves
