[00:04:35] <Activ8> hello
[00:05:46] <RoyalJello> Hey. What is down
[00:06:52] <Activ8> the floor
[00:07:36] <RoyalJello> what is down in a euphemistic sense?
[00:09:17] <Activ8> you mean what's up then?
[00:09:50] <Activ8> nothing much just watching a series on Netflix called omiscient
[00:09:58] <RoyalJello> :P
[00:10:11] <RoyalJello> omniscience would mean you would know what is up
[00:10:14] <RoyalJello> jk
[00:10:18] <RoyalJello> sounds interesting
[00:10:25] <Activ8> omniscient*
[00:10:45] <Activ8> it's good
[00:10:55] *** Joins: mooff1 (~mooff@awful.cooking)

[00:11:15] *** mooff1 is now known as mooff
[00:11:18] <RoyalJello> I was watching a series called Russian Doll
[00:11:27] <RoyalJello> a time loop story about a girl stuck in a groundhog of new york
[00:11:50] <Activ8> never heard of it, but if I like the synopsis I will put it on my playlist
[00:12:28] <RoyalJello> ehh it's an okay show.  The thing is more interesting on paper
[00:12:46] <RoyalJello> It has screwing around with time, but there are other good stories with the same premise
[00:13:08] <Activ8> omniscient is about tech
[00:13:24] <Activ8> a little worse than china's current model for society
[00:13:32] <Activ8> lol
[00:13:46] <RoyalJello> ha
[00:13:53] <RoyalJello> how do you get worse than 'copy the successful countries'?
[00:14:10] <Activ8> social model is what I meant
[00:14:19] <Activ8> and how you are judged as a person in society
[00:15:00] <Activ8> omniscient is something that monitors your every move, you are been watched 24/7 and your life is judged.  Everything is run by a "system".
[00:15:17] <RoyalJello> I actually write. I'm thinking of a better way of doing a 'Black Mirror but not' style of watchable tv experience.
[00:15:30] <RoyalJello> Being a black mirror esque theme and all
[00:15:41] <Activ8> fantastic, you got any books out
[00:15:41] <RoyalJello> ^^ the omniscient camera aka 1985
[00:15:44] <RoyalJello> 1984**
[00:15:54] <RoyalJello> Lol maybe
[00:16:12] <Activ8> interesting.
[00:18:24] <Activ8> oh wow I never knew what omniscient means as a word.  It's actually "knowing everything."
[00:18:38] <RoyalJello> it's a religious word
[00:18:42] <RoyalJello> omniscience and omnipotence
[00:18:52] <Activ8> something I never knew
[00:20:35] <RoyalJello> g2g
[00:20:45] <Activ8> np
