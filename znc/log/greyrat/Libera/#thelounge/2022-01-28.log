[07:36:13] <sixpiece> how when you want to buy everything is so expensive everyone has so much money the world is so full of possibilities, there's millions of jobs nobody wants to work , etc.. then you got something to offer oh we don't need anyone that's too expensive nobody has any money we have too many staff etc..
[07:36:59] <sixpiece> how does an irc network get patronized anyways?
[07:37:13] <winter> what?
[07:37:24] <xnaas> If you want to chat use #thelounge-offtopic or ##chat
[07:37:28] <xnaas> this is an on-topic channel
[07:37:31] <sixpiece> ok

[07:37:50] <xnaas> It's a bouncer and client.
[07:38:08] <xnaas> you can try the demo at https://demo.thelounge.chat/
[07:38:23] <xnaas> You can open the same client on your phone, desktop, laptop, etc.

[07:45:22] <sixpiece> well it's time to start

[07:45:42] <sixpiece> but I guess I stumbled upon you guys for good reason
[07:47:29] <sixpiece> getting some warnings on the installation : npm WARN deprecated har-validator@5.1.5: this library is no longer supported
[07:48:15] <xnaas> There's a lot of out of date dependencies. I believe mostly bookworm is working on getting those updated, but it's a lot of work to review stuff.

[07:51:22] <sixpiece> makes sense
[07:51:33] <sixpiece> just getting it working now
[07:52:15] <sixpiece> I tried upgrading my npm and seeing if it made a difference doing another install, going to launch it after, and unblock the port for now and then later will probably do a sort of reverse proxy
[07:52:40] <xnaas> Once it's installed, make sure to review config.js and edit stuff accordingly. The comments in the file are very informative. :)
[07:55:34] <sixpiece> question is it udp or tcp?
[07:57:01] <sixpiece> tcp it seems like
[07:57:10] <xnaas> I assume TCP unless you put a proxy in front that supports QUIC and all that fancy stuff, but I can't personally say for sure.

[08:07:24] <sixpiece> for example, suppose I have Kosher Jewish chat for example, and another one for Christian mingling, and another one for gardening discussions and another one for something else
[08:07:31] <sixpiece> is it possible to have this?

[08:09:06] <sixpiece> thank you for sharing the application
[08:10:05] <sixpiece> http://videotron.eu:9000/ it's not secure I have to make it secure

[10:33:41] <bookworm> LordRishav: the package from the AUR expects you to run TL as a system service, not as your user and the default TL home is in /etc. If you want to run it as your own user you need to execute TL as `THELOUNGE_HOME=~/.thelounge thelounge` (or just export the env var if you need it for more than a one shot). The user service does this for you, but
[10:33:41] <bookworm> you also need to add users and such

[19:33:38] <Telgareith> I guess I'll give it a go, I figured it was a channel for VLC
[19:33:53] <Jay2k1> or maybe #ffmpeg

[23:55:04] <thelounge4219> i don't hate anything blindly, i'm a developer, and npm is a dependency hell
[23:55:17] <thelounge4219> this is not how you develop something well
[23:57:38] <Bytewave> There are plenty of good applications developed with Node, this being one of them. Dismissing any work built with Node just because npm isn't an amazing package ecosystem isn't productive.
[23:57:38] <Bytewave> this probably isn't the place for debating this, though.
