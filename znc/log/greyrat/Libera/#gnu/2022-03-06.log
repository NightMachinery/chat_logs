[05:59:02] <LohanG> If you think a particular project needs to be forked, write a rational, convincing email or a text on why it is needed and share it among those who are interested. That way, people can take their time and consider it.
[05:59:20] <LohanG> In the meantime, create a web page, a mailing list, an IRC channel or some platform so you can build the discussion along the intended line. Take the initiative and indicate that you are capable of handling such a task.

[07:34:26] *** Quits: hexadecimal_blob (~FF@32.211.211.39) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:34:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> first do you use libre software?
[07:34:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> do you use coreboot based system?
[07:35:26] *** Joins: hexadecimal_blob (~FF@32.211.211.39)
[07:35:54] <labrador> M3RELATIVISM[m], no not right now. But even if I do in the future I won't choose libreboot. It runs on so little devices and even then with a subpar experience.
[07:35:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and lastly if nobody "gives a f***" why was said manipulation effective on banning me from fsf without explanation on the first place by iankperson?
[07:36:03] <labrador> Compared to coreboot

[07:36:41] <Noisytoot> M3RELATIVISM[m]: You were most likely banned because of this spam. No manipulation involved.
[07:36:48] <ggoes> ^
[07:36:52] <labrador> Nobody wants to help leah in this "fight" to. Its just that she doesn't seem to dwell on it and keep disturbing us
[07:36:55] <labrador> unlike you
[07:36:59] <Harzilein> is there a hostmask that only matches those who get here through the matrix gateway?
[07:37:16] <Noisytoot> Harzilein: Yes, but only those without cloaks
[07:37:42] <Harzilein> Noisytoot: but those would still have [m] in their nickname?

[07:37:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the reality is if this so called "spam" would not had been shared so presistantly the last few week I will bet you a large summ that libreboot would have been reintroduced in GNUproject
[07:38:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> there wer banter regarding it already
[07:38:29] <ggoes> there's no "so-called" about it. you're posting long, unwanted messages verbatim, over and over again. that is more or less the textbook definition of spam
[07:38:37] <Harzilein> M3RELATIVISM[m]: so you think this is a gambling channel? prediction market or w/e?
[07:38:41] <labrador> M3RELATIVISM[m], libreboot is not coming back to gnu. And that is the decision of the maintainer

[07:43:52] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> after it was quicked out of GNU
[07:43:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because of this exact same situation
[07:43:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but involving RMS back in 2016
[07:43:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> btw this was also the start of his whole canceling campaign
[07:43:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> was based on rumors also spread by said peer back in 2016
[07:43:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> look into it things will make much more sense I promisse
[07:44:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by the way not "ex-libreboot-developer" but censored libreboot developer

[07:47:05] <labrador> M3RELATIVISM[m], wait you can remove arbitrary commits from git?
[07:47:10] <labrador> I don't think so
[07:47:10] <Harzilein> k, hf M3RELATIVISM[m], surely your need for clarifying everything down to the last iota trumps other's need for #gnu. surely writing something after you write is a penny shaving version of censorship and i should feel bad. i'll remove myself from the danger of causing further damage.

[07:47:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> not it doesnt if you are the single contributor
[07:48:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because you removed everybody else
[07:48:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and rebuild repositories
[07:48:11] <Noisytoot> leah is definitely not the only user with a libreboot git clone
[07:48:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> like leah did
[07:48:20] <labrador> Noisytoot, oh yeah I thought it would break something. THanks!

[07:49:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is the original one
[07:49:24] <labrador> Like how would I see tamperation if the only repo I have is one from before and the current one?
[07:49:25] <Noisytoot> M3RELATIVISM[m]: Seperating it into multiple repositories. The old one wasn't deleted, just renamed.
[07:49:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that one was also reset
[07:49:33] <jxself> labrador: Anyone can run git clone and get a copy. If the history is later changed the hashes also change, so it's easy to find when comparing the two.
[07:49:39] <labrador> oh
[07:49:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is not actually athe old one
[07:49:54] <labrador> Thats quite a nice design for git :)

[07:57:15] <labrador> Ok M3RELATIVISM[m] you did convice me that leah is an asshole. But this kind of argument and sourcing is how you convince people. Not spamming links to people who do not want to see it.
[07:57:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> yes sadly this was hard to do when you are contantly being treathen with
[07:57:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> muttes bans
[07:58:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and at the same time trying to refute every single lie and manipulation
[07:58:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by said peer
[07:59:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> including "he is obseeded with me", "is allways doing this on other rooms", "allways pming me", "allways harrasing me" 
[07:59:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "give me death treaths"
[07:59:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> obviously all of the above are just pure deception, manipulation and lies, not like I havent said it enough times
[08:00:07] <labrador> Yeah you cannot really remove core devs because you think they aren't doing enough work. It isn't your project anymore. Tho they should have been a bit more careful about doing work on libreboot.org which was owned by leah
[08:00:21] <labrador> Best option is whenever ownership is transferred,take everything.
[08:00:26] <labrador> Thats the lesson
[08:00:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah was left the project back in 2016 after doing exactly the samething to other people
[08:00:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> RMS included
[08:01:22] <hexadecimal_blob> #x86-problems
[08:01:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by the ways has I said the whole RMS cancelling thing really started with lies from leah about Stallman
[08:01:40] <ggoes> 86 problems but a risc ain't one
[08:01:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has you can see manipulation is very hard to revert
[08:02:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and only through cheers presistance, and so called "spamming" sadly one can do it
[08:02:42] <labrador> Again M3RELATIVISM[m]...spamming won't convince anyone
[08:02:45] <ggoes> again, it is not so-called when you're pasting the same paragraph over and over again. it is "so-called" in the sense that that's what everyone calls spam
[08:02:45] <labrador> Its a waste of time
[08:02:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I would really advise next time for ops to demand prove when such nasty accusations are 
[08:02:56] <labrador> Think again about what you think you're accomplishing by that
[08:02:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> made
[08:03:06] <labrador> Because its a big zero
[08:03:13] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> it will make the victim, much more able to defend himself
[08:03:18] <labrador> Nah
[08:03:23] <labrador> It just makes people annoyed
[08:03:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> gladly I have the time for this rightnow

[11:06:30] <leah> i wish M3RELATIVISM[m] the best of luck in his efforts, in that regard. i'm actually looking forward to seeing his work come into fruition
[11:06:48] <leah> i also like his ideas for HyperbolaBSD. he wants to create a bootloader using OpenBSD's octboot
[11:06:52] <leah> a little context about octboot:
[11:07:03] <leah> it was created for OpenPower systems such as Talos II
[11:07:21] <leah> Talos II's "petitboot" bootloader is linux-based and boots linux kernels using kexec i think?
[11:07:33] <leah> anyway, openbsd wanted something to boot openbsd kernels.
[11:07:51] <leah> so they made a tiny version of their kernel, for bootstrapping a larger one, with the same kind of kexec but for theirs
[11:07:58] <leah> octboot is intended for that, on openpower
[11:08:08] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m] wants to bring that to x86
[11:08:20] <leah> and create a bootloader for openbsd, ready to use by the hyperbolabsd project

[11:20:52] <leah> i'm curous what those people will come up with
[11:21:28] <river> I don't like the bootloader on rapsberry pi
[11:21:32] <river> i want to use u-boot instead
[11:21:54] <leah> there is one thing that comes to mind, regarding hyperbolabsd: they probably won't have as much personpower
[11:22:04] <river> maybe they can use horsepower
[11:22:04] <leah> so i imagine they'll probably merge a lot of stuff from upstream
[11:22:12] <leah> drivers and such, over time
[11:22:22] <leah> what happened to libertybsd?
[11:22:37] <leah> it was an fsdg fork of openbsd
[11:26:37] <leah> labrador: there was a massive leak of windows source code many years ago
[11:26:50] <leah> large parts of windows 2000. it was almost complete
[11:26:57] <leah> but microsoft wasn't hurt by this action
[11:28:45] <leah> there is another aspect: nvidia is probably less likely to cooperate with us in the future. they would not have cooperated with us anyway but this is just another nail i guess
[11:29:24] <leah> so, their source being leaked actually hurts us in the long run, and it's illegal to use any of that code anyway, and it makes free software troublesome if you did look at it, because now any free software you work on is "tainted"

[13:49:10] <leah> everyone else either got bored (it happens. people move on), or they're still here
[13:49:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "just chill" this is not about chilling but truth
[13:49:20] <leah> gnutoo has been contributing patches integrating u-boot in libreboot
[13:49:27] <leah> it's even documented on libreboot.org now
[13:49:36] <leah>  just need to merge actual board config then it's done
[13:49:47] <leah> asus c201 chromebook in libreboot had depthcharge payload
[13:49:54] <leah> it's being re-added for the next release, but with u-boot
[13:50:14] <leah> and hopefully also grub (not the uboot profile. i mean bare metal. the uboot one works, but we want a clean implementation)
[13:50:29] <leah> pretty amazing work
[13:50:58] <leah> and all of it done by people besides me. i'm not the abusive control freak you think i am. i gladly let people contribute
[13:51:09] <leah> and if they don't like the way things are done... they can do their own thing. and that's ok
[13:51:46] <leah> people have. for example, librecore started because damo22 didn't like the workflow in libreboot, or the build system. he wanted a hardfork of coreboot without blobs, instead of "deblobbing" in a build system like libreboot
[13:51:52] <leah> (libreboot does it linux-libre style)
[13:52:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "specifically. put it in a bullet-pointed, itemized list" you have abbussed you power when discussiong a topic for almost 2 hours and and obviously when someone comes arround and point out and refutes your broken logic on your arguments even if I dont support said person you automatially stated the topic was offtopic, I have logs on that bythe way,  so basically you abbusive your position of power to silence anyone that you feel is
[13:52:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> presenting valid and rational refutations to your nonsensical point
[13:52:30] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: your description might apply to swiftgeek though. he was pretty dismissive in general of contributors
[13:52:45] <leah> it's one of the reasons i kicked him out actually, because he had the same kind of behaviour you're accusing me of
[13:52:55] <leah> i guess some of that might have rubbed off on me, because you were dealing with us both
[13:52:58] <leah> but i have nothing against you
[13:53:02] <leah> and i wish you'd stop this angry tirade
[13:53:07] <leah> it's unproductive for either of us

[13:53:48] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: my attitude was always like that
[13:53:57] <leah> i'm basically the tyler durden of free software project leaders

[14:03:36] <leah> (and you're dead wrong btw)
[14:04:18] <leah> i think damo22 was just pissed at me because libreboot was in a very good position in gnu
[14:04:28] <leah> and maybe he wanted to make a name for himself out of that, back then
[14:04:37] <leah> he has since continued to do good work, independently

[14:06:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and past libreboot contributors, when people show arguments and refute your obviously biased position again deception will not be accept and will not work

[14:06:35] <leah> look at libreboot git
[14:06:48] <leah> gnutoo is basically a co-founder of the project. he gave me lots of advice in early days
[14:06:53] <leah> he's still there
[14:07:06] <leah> largely in an advisory capacity but lately he has contributed actual patches
[14:07:10] <leah> u-boot integration patches

[14:07:58] <leah> i'm sorry you feel this way, M3RELATIVISM[m] 
[14:08:10] <leah> but i want you to cease these actions against me on public irc channels
[14:08:22] <leah> it's unfair, to yourself and also me, and everyone who is forced to listen to it
[14:08:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "ou spend hours of your time ranting about me on fsf irc channels?" because you keep being deceptive about the whole ordeal, nd keep spreading lies about my person instead of admiting your wrong doing ounce and for all, byt I will continue to refute any and all you bulshit lies here ;)

[14:11:20] <leah> i mean
[14:11:30] <leah> it's just speculation. i wasn't asserting it as truth

[14:11:51] <leah> i actually asked him to stay

[14:12:32] <leah> which is rare
[14:12:36] <leah> you're one of those rare exceptions
[14:13:13] <leah> as for swiftgeek and andrew... it had to be done. they were running the project into the ground, and i irresponsibly let their work continue for too long. their code was shit

[14:13:58] <leah> but in 2021, enough was enough. it had been 5 years and the project was years away from another release. i had to take action by that point
[14:13:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> gnutoo is also starting to understand the farse and understanding and the deceptiveness, I dont whish to bring him up regardless without his presence, "feel this way" is not about felling but you admiting to your wrong doing and commit to a democratic gvornance of the project so we can call it something else but "leahboot", 
[14:14:04] <leah> that's why i rebooted the project
[14:14:08] <leah> and got 2 releases out btw
[14:14:13] <leah> and

[14:18:23] <leah> i did that in 6 months
[14:18:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "the project went underwent a rewrite for years, that went stale with no releases" this is unrelated

[14:18:33] <leah> oh?
[14:18:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by silencing people and your constant abussive misdeminer
[14:18:38] <labrador> leah, the problem is..they were the leaders. after giving over a project,its not called firing but being an asshole
[14:19:04] <leah> what if said leaders keep promising a release in a few weeks, then not doing it. and imagine they do that for years
[14:19:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "ft/andrew were bad leaders. i was wrong to put them in charge. so i threw them out" the thing is leah the world doesnt circle arround you yout
[14:19:16] <leah> and then imagine, it's been 5 years and they're still promising it
[14:19:28] <leah> labrador: and when i did that, they hadn't written any code in almost a year
[14:19:32] <leah> they had given up on it
[14:19:43] <labrador> you still had no authority leah. the most you can do is fork it

[14:19:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no Im not "obsessive with you " no matter how much you want that to be truth, I just pointing out your bulshit actions, and will continue to do so while you keep trying to manipulate people here
[14:20:07] <labrador> no authority over them no
[14:20:28] <leah> labrador: but at the time, i had resumed my own work and gotten a release ready. in mere months, versus their 5 years and they had nothing ready
[14:20:37] <leah> and i own the domain name
[14:20:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> this is a totally diferent discussion
[14:20:57] <leah> i consider it morally acceptable to take control of my own project
[14:21:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has I said just beacuse Im pointing out your lies
[14:21:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> dont mean I think you do bad work
[14:21:12] <labrador> leah, doesnt matter. And yes that was their downfall. they should have taken control over the domain
[14:21:15] <leah> what isn't morally acceptable is M3RELATIVISM[m]'s constant harassing of my name in public channels
[14:21:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just simple that you were lying
[14:21:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> nothing else

[14:27:08] <leah> the reason i renamed the repository is simple
[14:27:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> before abbusive and authoritarian ban with 5 mins just because I presented a refuting argument to your point
[14:27:15] <leah> if someone looks at notabug.org/libreboot
[14:27:17] <leah> well
[14:27:19] <leah> if they then see:
[14:27:23] <leah> notabug.org/libreboot/libreboot
[14:27:27] <leah> they'll naturally think that's the main repo
[14:27:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> afer you spoke on the topic for almost 2 hours
[14:27:36] <leah> i split the repo into smaller repos, because of bloat
[14:27:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> was intantly offtopic when some present a valid argument agaisnt you nonsense
[14:27:48] <leah> the repo was too huge. so it was done to clean everything up and make it smaller
[14:27:51] <leah> total reboot
[14:27:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is good
[14:28:06] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: but you say i did that to hide the truth
[14:28:08] <leah> i don't hide the truth
[14:28:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has I said I dont hold gruges in people
[14:28:19] <leah> i fully admit that what i did to swiftgeek wasn't nice to him
[14:28:24] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no matter how wrong doing they did in the past
[14:28:26] <leah> it upset him greatly. and i did it, knowing it would
[14:28:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I will just not tolearate deception
[14:28:37] <leah> but you say the world doesn't revolve around me
[14:28:41] <leah> the same can be said of him
[14:28:51] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> especially when you admit to wrong doing in private
[14:28:56] <leah> he was no longer effective as a leader of the project, and no longer reliably capable of doing releases
[14:28:58] <leah> so i fired him
[14:29:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and then come here like none of that happend
[14:29:09] <leah> sometimes in life, you have to take such actions for the greater good
[14:29:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just shows lack of integrity
[14:29:17] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: and i bet you aren't even reading any of this
[14:29:20] <leah> or will twist it against me
[14:29:22] <leah> and that's ok
[14:29:26] <leah> but at least i've told you the truth, as i see it
[14:29:32] <leah> and i still have nothing against you at all
[14:29:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sadly I know understand why you ask sorry was just all based on selfintrest regarding my octboot idea
[14:29:48] <leah> not true
[14:29:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I should have seen it earlier and not engage
[14:30:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if its not true why are you double faced and ask sorry in one place 
[14:30:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and them continue lies here in front of ops?
[14:30:29] <leah> because i did and do feel bad for upsetting you
[14:30:39] <leah> your subsequent actions, such as these tirades about me in #gnu, are uncool
[14:30:41] <leah> but
[14:30:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has I said this is not personal
[14:30:45] <leah> i did feel bad for you. and still do
[14:30:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and not about upsetting anyone
[14:30:54] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: it isn't personal?
[14:31:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but you contantly
[14:31:08] <leah> then why is this focused on my person, predicated upon your feelings about past events?
[14:31:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ofuscating your previously abussive lies instead of admiting wrong doing
[14:31:28] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> nothing wrong with that
[14:31:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is also very coroages if you ask me
[14:31:47] <leah> ???
[14:31:59] <leah> could just be the lack of caffeine, but you've stopped making sense
[14:32:01] <leah> brb
[14:32:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> we must allways be ready to accept we are incorrept
[14:32:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is actually how we grow
[14:32:29] <labrador> leah, there is no greater good...and you didn't have any authority over the project
[14:32:31] * M3RELATIVISM[m] doesnt drink cofee btw
[14:32:32] <labrador> That is true
[14:32:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is a nasty habit in my opinion
[14:33:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> especially given cofee seed has been so commercialized nowadays
[14:33:16] <leah> anyway
[14:33:23] <leah> several points....
[14:33:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> happy to see deception has finally ended
[14:33:32] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: let's get down to brass tacks
[14:33:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and can go do something productive
[14:33:49] <leah> * you were constantly derailing discussions in #libreboot with irrelevant shit
[14:33:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> oh no here it starts again
[14:34:07] <leah> * you were offering nothing to the project. nothing at all
[14:34:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah: that was not me that was the pinaplenamed peer
[14:34:19] <leah> * in short, your presence had not only zero value, but negative value
[14:34:35] <leah> * you constantly got into fights with people in channel
[14:34:46] <labrador> leah, uh maybe look at yourself in the mirror. You are the guy who thinks luke smith is a neo-nazi.
[14:34:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has you see I dont know if this is or porpouse or if your memory is really falling on you now
[14:34:54] <leah> * eventually, you said something that was just really shitty, and that was the straw that broke the camel's back
[14:35:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah: that is not for you to decide
[14:35:06] <leah> i banned your ass
[14:35:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> it is up to the community
[14:35:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is the only and single point here
[14:35:22] <leah> ???
[14:35:30] <leah> what is for community to decide?
[14:35:33] <labrador> leah, said something "really shitty"
[14:35:34] <labrador> sure
[14:35:41] *** Quits: thorre (~thorre@user/thorre) (Quit: bye bye)
[14:35:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> libreboot is not like a kindom you can stack you flag on, it was a previously democratic
[14:35:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> runned project
[14:35:54] <leah> it wasn't democratic though
[14:36:01] <leah> it just had a different bdfl
[14:36:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> even if no advancements were made
[14:36:03] <leah> named swiftgeek
[14:36:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is a diferent discussion
[14:36:27] <leah> the project had a "democratic management guidelines" on the website, but in reality it was just 1 guy running it: swiftgeek
[14:36:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> here we are specifically speaking about you actions and your inability to admit 
[14:36:36] <leah> i stepped down for a few years to focus on health issues
[14:36:40] <leah> mental health issues
[14:36:44] <labrador> leah, the point is
[14:36:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "the project had a "democratic management guidelines" on the website, but in reality it was just 1 guy running it: swiftgeek" indee I agree
[14:36:55] <leah> i came back years later, the project was a mess
[14:36:55] <labrador> Stepping down doesn't mean you can step up whenever you want
[14:36:58] <leah> so i decided fuck it
[14:36:59] <labrador> Thats ridiculous
[14:37:02] <leah> let's just do everything myself
[14:37:04] <leah> so i did
[14:37:05] <labrador> leah, and fork it
[14:37:07] *** Joins: Haaninjo (~anders@fsf/member/Haaninjo)
[14:37:10] <labrador> But you didn;t
[14:37:12] <leah> labrador: nope. it was mine to take
[14:37:17] <labrador> You instead decided to hijack it
[14:37:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by the way again I was not the one derailing conversation it was actuall pinaplewhatname
[14:37:22] <labrador> leah, wasn't yours
[14:37:23] <leah> hijack is the word you use
[14:37:31] <leah> from my perspective, i was taking it back
[14:37:34] <labrador> leah, nope
[14:37:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> remeber allways adressing everybody by "Sir"
[14:37:37] <leah> after it being hijacked and sidelined for years
[14:37:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you are confusing things sadly
[14:37:45] <labrador> leah, you stepped down
[14:37:48] <labrador> Wasn't hijacked
[14:37:58] <leah> that was just politics
[14:38:02] <labrador> leah, uh huh
[14:38:07] <labrador> "Just politics"
[14:38:14] <leah> i simply put someone else in charge
[14:38:19] <leah> that person did a bad job
[14:38:24] <labrador> leah, and they became the head instea
[14:38:25] <labrador> d
[14:38:28] <leah> and i removed them, after giving them too many chances
[14:38:29] <labrador> Now you had no power
[14:38:38] <labrador> leah, you cannot remove someone who you have no power over
[14:38:41] *** Quits: Iamthehuman1 (~noname@user/iamthehuman) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[14:38:47] <leah> labrador: yes, i can. and i did
[14:38:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> btw "leah didnt put anyone in charge]"
[14:38:52] <leah> and i'm proud of what i did
[14:38:53] <labrador> leah, nope
[14:38:58] <leah> the libreboot project had no releases in years
[14:39:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> dont believe that peer deception
[14:39:06] <labrador> leah, you're proud like a narcissistic person is sure
[14:39:09] <labrador> Otherwise no
[14:39:15] <leah> here i came along, starting in december 2020. i re-fork the old project and bring it up to speed in mere weeks
[14:39:18] <leah> and polished it in months
[14:39:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah that is a unrelated discussion
[14:39:22] <leah> and did 2 releases in 1 year
[14:39:26] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: how though?
[14:39:28] <labrador> leah, reforking is fine...hijacking isn't
[14:39:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> we are not disgracing you amazing work
[14:39:31] <labrador> You did the latter
[14:39:37] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and what you did
[14:39:47] <leah> labrador: but why don't you also apply the same standard to the people i usurped?
[14:39:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just how you did it and how that is unaceptable and abusive ;)
[14:39:56] <leah> why should they have stayed, instead of forked?
[14:40:02] <labrador> leah, what did they do huh?
[14:40:04] <leah> which, btw, i suggested they do. and offered support
[14:40:09] <labrador> leah, because it was their project
[14:40:11] <labrador> They owned it
[14:40:12] <leah> labrador: they did nothing. and that's the point
[14:40:15] <leah> they did nothing
[14:40:17] <leah> for years
[14:40:21] <labrador> leah, they didn't need to
[14:40:25] <labrador> Thats my point
[14:40:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah if you havent been insecure bout it and had done it the proper way
[14:40:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I would probably had suported the plead to give libreboot project back to you
[14:41:04] <leah> labrador: can i ask you this:
[14:41:06] <labrador> yeah no one would have been wronged...and the og libreboot would have fallen into disuse
[14:41:13] <labrador> Your fork winning
[14:41:14] <leah> what would you say if it was Richard Stallman taking back control of emacs?
[14:41:18] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sadly you did it with an insane web of lies and decepting everyone on the way
[14:41:20] <leah> he currently does not develop it
[14:41:22] <labrador> leah, still bullshit
[14:41:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just to get more control
[14:41:37] <leah> i never deceived anyone
[14:41:41] <leah> it's all on my site
[14:41:43] <leah> and repo
[14:41:51] <leah> written in ink
[14:41:56] <labrador> leah, well yeah you did. You deceived swiftgeek and and_who
[14:41:56] <leah> in bold letter
[14:42:02] <labrador> uh huh
[14:42:03] <leah> deceived?
[14:42:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> oh really
[14:42:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> how did you manage to get op on irc channel?
[14:42:32] <leah> which one?
[14:42:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the way you did it is pure evil and highly deceptive
[14:42:49] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: i never gave up +F on #libreboot
[14:42:53] <leah> and never gave it to anyone, ever
[14:42:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you had come to an agreement about lbmk
[14:42:57] <leah> never gave up the domain name
[14:43:13] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> where all parties were in agreemnet, 
[14:43:14] <leah> it was my project to do what i want with
[14:43:16] <leah> and still is
[14:43:24] <leah> but i do let people contribute to it
[14:43:27] <leah> because i want it to improve
[14:43:27] <labrador> leah, then the blame would go on to those two for leaving you with that power
[14:43:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> then ounce you got control you used that control to kick censor lie and ban othe contribs
[14:43:48] <leah> labrador: they accepted it and knew they had to do a good job
[14:43:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> when all that was unecessary
[14:43:53] <labrador> Once you step down you are stripped of all powers
[14:43:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given there was a agreement
[14:43:54] <leah> they failed to do their job so i removed them
[14:43:56] <labrador> Thats how it works
[14:43:56] <leah> and replaced them
[14:44:00] <labrador> leah, it wasn't a jo
[14:44:00] <labrador> b
[14:44:01] <leah> first i replaced them with myself
[14:44:04] <labrador> They owned it
[14:44:08] <labrador> They cannot be replaced
[14:44:09] <leah> but now, because of my actions, the project is moving again
[14:44:15] <leah> and people have joined again
[14:44:19] <labrador> leah, irrelevant
[14:44:21] <leah> and i'm very thankful to all contributors
[14:44:25] <leah> labrador: irrelevant to what?
[14:44:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> on top of that off course you could remove commit acess, so you deleted old repo and created an entirelly new, censoring all the proves of such in the way
[14:44:37] <labrador> leah, the health of the project is irrelevant to your actions
[14:44:48] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: again, not deleted
[14:44:50] <leah> renamed
[14:44:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> point his you acted in a highly deceptive way and you continue doing so
[14:45:00] <labrador> yes
[14:45:05] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> a good first step would be a apology
[14:45:06] *** Quits: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif) (Remote host closed the connection)

[14:49:03] <leah> i explained that too
[14:49:05] <leah> literally here
[14:49:08] <leah> i'll explain it again:
[14:49:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> obviously to remove commit acess from others
[14:49:18] <leah> if someone looks at notabug.org/libreboot, what do they see:
[14:49:20] <leah> libreboot.git and lbmk.git
[14:49:24] <leah> libreboot.git in obsolete
[14:49:30] <leah> but do the average person think that?
[14:49:32] <leah> no
[14:49:35] <leah> so they start contributing to it
[14:49:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and take back control of project in a forcefull and abusive action
[14:49:40] <leah> but i want them to contribute to lbmk.git instead

[14:49:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> also my of the work in lbmk was not proprerly attribute

[14:53:18] <leah> you just accused me of copyright infringement
[14:53:21] <leah> that's a serious accusation
[14:53:23] <leah> and it's false
[14:53:26] <leah> and i explained why
[14:53:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that was also by the way funnely enough the very same reason the hole nonsense started
[14:53:30] <leah> and you are ignoring my explanation
[14:53:44] <leah> i've also been candid about actions i took during 2021
[14:53:56] <leah> you accuse me of hiding but i haven't hidden anything
[14:53:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if that proves correct Im very sorry
[14:54:01] <leah> i'm being completely truthful

[14:54:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I will correct it when verifying again
[14:54:16] <leah> i will confirm these things:
[14:54:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> continuing of previous topic
[14:54:32] <leah> * i threw out 2 developers after they did 5 years of work rewriting libreboot
[14:54:39] <leah> * i threw away their *rewrite*
[14:54:47] <leah> * i forked *my* project from before the rewrite began
[14:54:56] <leah> * i replaced the rewrite with my new rewrite
[14:55:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just because I understand vitali having include "landchad" sevrvice, even if badly name and headed by a very biased individual, that doesnt mean all his work in garbage
[14:55:02] <leah> and i didn't use a single line of their code ;)
[14:55:06] <leah> i rewrote it all myself
[14:55:13] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the same way you have been higly deceptive
[14:55:20] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: and yes, you could call it a coup or a hijack
[14:55:22] <leah> but
[14:55:24] <leah> really?

[15:16:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the motivator not a big part of it
[15:16:35] <leah> i agree with you on that point, and it's one of the big reasons why i regret it
[15:16:46] <leah> molly de blanc got fired from fsf and wanted revenge against rms
[15:16:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is when all this nonsensical campaign started
[15:16:58] <leah> and she used my actions in 2016 as a precedent to launch her attack against rms
[15:17:01] <leah> an attack which was unfair

[15:20:07] <leah> i'm sorry that you *think* i owe you an apology
[15:20:23] <leah> maybe i'm an asshole. so what
[15:20:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you dont see it yet but you massively did
[15:20:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by abusing your power
[15:20:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and forcing your bias on others
[15:20:37] <leah> my users and my customers are happy, and i work with plenty of smart people every day, and i think i'm doing good
[15:20:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by silencing them, prefusly lying about what really happend
[15:20:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and being highly deceptive when faced with reality
[15:20:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again this is not a personal atck to you
[15:20:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I will never hold gruges on people, or at least try not to how dificult that might be
[15:20:40] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the point is I prefer  empathy, I will not accept lies, manipulation or deception though. 
[15:20:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Thanks regardeless
[15:20:41] <leah> the net gain is positive
[15:20:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> this would be a good time for a apology
[15:20:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> btw
[15:20:52] <leah> i'm doing good work that benefits many people
[15:21:02] <leah> and with my new project, osboot, that could become millions of people
[15:21:08] <leah> libreboot probably has 10000 users
[15:21:12] <leah> osboot could get 1000000
[15:21:45] <leah> i think i've concluded that i should just let you keep badmouthing me, and stop these discussions
[15:21:48] <leah> maybe you'll get bored
[15:21:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no need to be upset this is just a logical discourse not a personal atack like you seam to be doing to me
[15:21:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is important to separate thing here
[15:21:55] <leah> but if you think i'm abusive and toxic, so be it
[15:22:01] <leah> i'm proud of my actions
[15:22:03] <leah> and i stand by them
[15:22:14] <leah> i owe you nothing, nor anyone else anything
[15:22:19] <labrador> leah, thats because you're a narcissist
[15:22:25] <leah> so be it
[15:22:33] <leah> you're wrong btw
[15:22:38] <leah> and i know you're wrong
[15:22:39] <labrador> uh huh
[15:22:44] <labrador> Sure you do
[15:22:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no this is not about someone being an "asshole", toxic or abusive but admiting to wrong doing
[15:22:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I knwo that is quite hard given ego is to strong at times
[15:23:13] <leah> i've apologized many times for wrongdoing btw, when i've made a mistake
[15:23:25] <leah> but this isn't one of those times
[15:23:40] <labrador> leah, you made a mistake by hijacking libreboot
[15:23:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sure in your delusion might not be
[15:23:51] <leah> you're a talentless twat who derailed my channel constantly, and broke the last straw by ignoring my instruction not to talk about a known neo-nazi in my channel
[15:24:00] <labrador> leah, uh huh
[15:24:12] <labrador> I think you're the crazy one here if you think everyone is a neo-nazi
[15:24:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> there are public logs about it iregarding of your own opinion
[15:24:23] <leah> labrador: by your and M3RELATIVISM[m]'s calculation, i've made a mistake by being allowed
[15:24:27] <leah> labrador: by your and M3RELATIVISM[m]'s calculation, i've made a mistake by being alive*
[15:24:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah is really the nazi here
[15:24:31] <leah> i'm not allowed to win
[15:24:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> forcing her bias on anyone that presents arguments against her statements
[15:25:01] <labrador> leah, you are...if you didn't hijack libreboot...and if you stop being delusional and seeing everyone as nazis
[15:25:04] <leah> i've tried to engage with M3RELATIVISM[m] 
[15:25:04] <labrador> Pretty simple
[15:25:07] <leah> he won't have none of it
[15:25:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> lies
[15:25:20] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you made a doublefaced apology
[15:25:23] <labrador> But I can understand your mental condition leah...it probably can never happen
[15:25:44] <leah> i have real work to do
[15:25:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because you saw a areal fork might be happening
[15:26:07] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: i literally want your octboot-based heads replacement to happen
[15:26:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> great no more liess will be spread
[15:26:15] <labrador> leah, good for you. You're under no force to continue to participate
[15:26:16] <leah> i want another coreboot distro to exist
[15:26:29] <leah> i don't see it as a fork or competition
[15:26:37] <leah> and if you have anything useful, i'll merge it in my project
[15:26:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> great go work
[15:26:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and try not to be deceptive in future
[15:26:47] <leah> i've recently merged logic that was pulled out of heads
[15:26:49] <labrador> M3RELATIVISM[m], maybe try to outcompete libreboot
[15:26:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ;) thanks
[15:26:56] <leah> written from scratch, but based on reading the logic in heads
[15:26:58] <leah> for a few tasks
[15:27:00] <labrador> With an incompatible license M3RELATIVISM[m] 
[15:27:04] <labrador> So she can't steal
[15:27:05] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> labrador: that is what is sad here
[15:27:05] <leah> i'm not against other projects existing
[15:27:08] <leah> i want them to exist
[15:27:11] <leah> you know what they say
[15:27:13] <leah> the more the merrior
[15:27:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah has done some amazing work
[15:27:21] <leah> competition in free software is a gift, not a curse
[15:27:28] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: who knows? maybe you'll even do a good job
[15:27:37] <leah> maybe even a better one
[15:27:39] <leah> i hope you do
[15:27:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> anf this "competion" is not needed as long as everyone acts in a democratixc and logical manner
[15:27:55] <leah> and if you do, i will assimilate you. which is to say, i will learn everything i can
[15:28:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> there is already very little resources allocated to libre firmware
[15:28:02] <leah> i'm always looking to grow my knowledge and expand my power
[15:28:07] <labrador> leah, you sound like a terminator right now
[15:28:10] <leah> when i say "power" i'm referring to skill
[15:28:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> we should not fargment it further
[15:28:10] <labrador> Please don't
[15:28:21] <labrador> >assimilate you
[15:28:23] <labrador> lmao
[15:28:28] <leah> it's a joke lol
[15:28:38] <leah> because i use 4of7 as a name on some sites
[15:28:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sadly leah think the world surronds arround here
[15:28:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and that Im prsonally atacking her
[15:28:55] <leah> you think i think the world revolves around #gnu?
[15:29:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> which is defenatly not the case
[15:29:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just flaggy not so good decision and abbusive actions by said peer
[15:29:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is all
[15:29:40] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: your "democracy" as you put it is a total sham. there still ends up being a leadership that has ultimate power
[15:29:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> an apology would be nice but not really necessary
[15:29:44] <labrador> leah, maybe try apologizing to the project leaders whose project you hijacked
[15:29:45] <leah> look at recent events in Rust for example
[15:30:02] <leah> the core team actually doing the real work on the project, want to do things their way
[15:30:04] <labrador> forcefully
[15:30:05] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> dont compare me with rust please
[15:30:14] <leah> but then another useless part of rust tried to oversee what they were doing, and control them
[15:30:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I have extensively cretized rust
[15:30:19] <leah> but that other team wasn't contributing code or ideas
[15:30:20] <labrador> leah, rust isn't that good of an example anyway
[15:30:24] <leah> just a bunch of talentless twits
[15:30:25] <labrador> Shit language
[15:30:27] <leah> whereas
[15:30:29] <leah> the core team
[15:30:31] <leah> they are amazing
[15:30:37] <leah> i happen to not like rust as a language
[15:30:39] <leah> but
[15:30:41] <leah> those people
[15:30:43] <leah> they have real talent
[15:30:46] <leah> and are doing some real innovations
[15:30:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93157
[15:30:50] <leah> i mean
[15:31:01] <leah> fuck, there's a whole coreboot fork rewritten in rust (oreboot)
[15:31:09] <leah> and an os, written by the great jeremy soller (redoxOS)
[15:31:15] <leah> all in rust
[15:31:20] <leah> and that's amazing
[15:31:24] <leah> truly amazing
[15:31:32] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> indeed
[15:31:50] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: my position on projects is... show me the code, and if you don't like it, fork off
[15:31:59] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: a well-known example of this is openbsd actually
[15:32:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> doenst hide the fact that you lied and decived people maliciously in the past ;
[15:32:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ;)
[15:32:11] <leah> it started because of disagreement with theo de raadt and the other netbsd guys. he's a co-founder of netbsd
[15:32:16] <leah> they kicked him off the project
[15:32:18] <leah> and he said
[15:32:25] <leah> "i'll make my own theme park, with black jack and hookers"
[15:32:27] <leah> and he did
[15:32:29] <leah> it's called openbsd.org
[15:32:38] <leah> :P
[15:32:40] *** Joins: isf (~iShareFre@fsf/member/iShareFreedom)
[15:32:47] <leah> sorry, that was an obscure joke, referring to a futurama episode
[15:32:53] <leah> (blackjack and hookers joke)
[15:33:12] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: and openbsd is superior to netbsd
[15:33:14] <leah> in every way
[15:33:18] <labrador> leah, it isn't obscure anymore
[15:33:18] <leah> so i say to you
[15:33:20] <leah> do that
[15:33:43] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: anyway, at this point, i no longer care what you think
[15:33:50] <leah> if you think i've been malicious and abusive in the past... so be it
[15:33:55] <leah> and i will never apologize to you
[15:34:04] <leah> is that ok?
[15:34:25] <leah> if i just tell you to go fuck yourself i mean
[15:34:28] <leah> are we cool?
[15:34:38] <leah> serious question
[15:34:48] *** Quits: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:34:52] <leah> good luck with your new project
[15:35:43] <leah> i have full faith in myself, and the people who i happily work with. i don't need your approval
[15:35:46] <leah> you mean nothing to me
[15:36:00] <leah> nothing at all. so beat it
[15:36:45] <leah> but
[15:36:58] <leah> if you stop being angry in the future, and start making some nice contributions, especially code...
[15:37:05] <leah> i'd be happy to work with you. in the future
[15:37:38] <leah> "logic" is your asinine way of putting it. anyway, have fun sucking at life
[15:37:39] <leah> i'm out
[15:40:25] *** Quits: wxie (~wxie@101.88.37.70) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:42:15] <leah> fuck you in advance btw. in advance of anything you'll say next. you suck as a person, but i'm not really angry. i hope you become a better person, one day
[15:43:07] <leah> after dealing with you for weeks now, i'm throwing in the towel. you win. say whatever you want about me
[15:43:10] <leah> even if it's false. which it is
[15:44:02] <leah> i have the complete opposite of respect for you
[15:44:06] <leah> i think the word is contempt?
[15:44:17] <leah> yes, contempt. because you are contemptable, in every conceivable way
[15:44:45] <labrador> leah, I feel like you're going full delusional and ballistic lmao
[15:45:09] <leah> you have absolutely zero worth to the world
[15:45:12] <leah> go back to chopping trees
[15:45:57] <labrador> leah, maybe you too
[15:45:59] <labrador> Who knows
[15:46:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "im out", is sad the ammount of egomania involved for some to write this wall of text while being inable to accept wrongdoing, and past abussive actions. dont worry code will come. Is sad ego is the cause of fragmentation nontheless 
[15:47:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> btw
[15:47:17] * M3RELATIVISM[m] doesnt "choppe trees" but plants them
[15:47:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> even with such there is delusion
[15:47:31] <leah> ok, then you do have some worth to the world
[15:47:39] <leah> chopping trees is bad for the environment
[15:47:44] <leah> planting them is good
[15:47:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> anyway enough personal atacks have come in my way
[15:47:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I think people get the point now
[15:47:57] <leah> now you know how it feels, huh?
[15:48:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ?
[15:48:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no felling atached to this conversation
[15:48:24] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is very simple
[15:48:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you acted abussively and dont want to admit it
[15:48:57] <leah> yes, and the premise behind your actions was precisely that i wouldn't make a decision either way:
[15:48:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so you are going on a tantrum with lies and deception to cover and ofuscate your action
[15:49:03] <leah> to either apologize and admit wrongdoing
[15:49:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sadly enough
[15:49:10] <leah> or to not do so, and tell you to go fuck yourself
[15:49:19] <leah> i chose the latter. because i've done no wrong, and i don't owe you an apology
[15:49:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sure if that makes you feel more confortable take the ballon
[15:49:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if you wish
[15:49:43] <leah> will you leave me alone and drop all of this, now?
[15:49:55] <leah> you're never going to get any apologies or concessions out of me
[15:50:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> reality of the matter is your actions were unaceptable, no mater how much you try to convince yourself otherwise
[15:50:03] <leah> so you might aswell stop the effort
[15:50:15] <leah> go plant trees
[15:50:41] <leah> build a clubhouse in one of them
[15:50:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Im sure you will ounce times passes and you reflect on it
[15:50:50] <leah> i won't
[15:51:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> at least this time people will know the actual truth
[15:51:11] <leah> as time passes, i will forget you exist
[15:51:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and not your own manipulated version of it like it happend on 2016
[15:51:19] <leah> until you remind me of that unfortunate fact
[15:51:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> fortunately I have the time to refute you barage of lies at this moment
[15:51:46] <leah> do you have a life outside your house?
[15:51:52] <leah> how often do you go outside?
[15:51:56] <leah> (if not planting trees)
[15:51:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again the worl doesnt surrond arround you
[15:52:10] <leah> not really any of my business anyway
[15:52:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> fallacy of personal atack will not work with me

[15:52:37] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: i have a proposal
[15:52:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> have the corauge to admit it
[15:52:45] <leah> how about we both stop talking to/about each other?
[15:52:55] * M3RELATIVISM[m] is not intersted in engaging with you
[15:52:57] <leah> i feel like you probably think the same way about me as i do of you
[15:53:01] <leah> you say something, and i defend
[15:53:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just intends to refute your lies ounce they arrise
[15:53:08] <leah> but you see my defense as an attack, and defend
[15:53:22] <leah> all wars end in ceasefire, or mutual annihilation
[15:53:26] <leah> let's cease this and move on
[15:53:32] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I play the victim atck here
[15:53:41] <leah> if you stop talking to/about me, i will stop talking to/about you
[15:53:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> when you really the agressor
[15:53:48] <leah> i'm basically politely asking you to back off
[15:53:52] <leah> what do you think?
[15:53:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I know that has worked excusetly in the past for you
[15:53:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I will not allw it this time
[15:54:06] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> deception is not the way to go
[15:54:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just admit you wrong doing
[15:54:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> takes courage I know
[15:54:26] <leah> i will not
[15:54:40] <leah> i'm actually insulted btw. that you think i owe you anything
[15:54:40] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but will restore the little trust people still have on you ;)

[15:56:13] <labrador> leah, ur not
[15:56:27] <leah> all i did was ban you for misbehaving in one of my channels
[15:56:35] <leah> and now, as far as you're corncern, i'm hitler
[15:56:40] <leah> you even called me a nazi earlier
[15:56:40] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "who do you think you are anyway?" that is the thing reject ego and so this question is really meaningless, I could say the same for you sadly
[15:56:49] <leah> it might have been labrador who said it
[15:56:53] <leah> can't tell. you both talk in the same way
[15:56:59] <labrador> leah, hahaha k
[15:57:14] <labrador> Now you're gonna be saying I'm his alt
[15:57:18] <leah> no
[15:57:22] <leah> i just said you both sound the same
[15:57:31] <leah> i've spoken to you before, and i know you're not the same person
[15:57:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if you consider "misbehaving "presenting valid arguments aagainst your nonsensical statement"sure
[15:57:57] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: i was very patient wit hyou during your time in #libreboot
[15:58:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> lies
[15:58:10] <leah> i resisted banning you, many times, gave you many chances to improve your behaviour
[15:58:16] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> leah rambled for 2 hours
[15:58:28] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and in the 5minutes after I presented my arguments
[15:58:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> she absusively banned

[15:58:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> lies
[15:58:53] <leah> you continued talking about him
[15:58:56] <leah> so i banned you
[15:58:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you talked about it for 2 hours
[15:59:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I never said I support or defnd his ideology
[15:59:20] <leah> and yet
[15:59:22] <leah> you act like one
[15:59:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just that you cannot categorize all his work
[15:59:35] <leah> you use the same tactics
[15:59:40] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has garbage just because of his ideology

[15:59:52] <leah> i never said his work is garbage
[15:59:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the same way I dont categorize all your work as garbage
[15:59:57] <labrador> get this in your stupid little head
[15:59:59] <leah> his technical contributions are excellent
[16:00:02] <leah> and he's extremely intelligent

[16:00:18] <leah> so what?
[16:00:20] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I even though you act in a very athoritarianand power greedy way

[16:00:49] <labrador> leah, so he's cool
[16:00:50] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: but there is a problem here
[16:00:50] <labrador> Thats what
[16:01:05] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the issue here is the ease in which you manipullate silence and lie about others
[16:01:12] <leah> *most* people who have grievances with someone, don't repeat it for hours every day
[16:01:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I will not allow that as long as Im allive

[16:01:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again obession!= exposing your bullshit
[16:01:43] <leah> are you going to keep talking about this for the rest of your life?
[16:02:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> fortunately you are not op of this channel, because you woud obviously had already abuse you power to pressue this based world view in silencing decenting voices like you have done in libreboot

[16:04:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you are not an "asshole"
[16:04:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you just acted in a very abussive manner and fail to admit it when necessary
[16:05:01] <leah> right, but we've established:
[16:05:05] <leah> 1) i disagree with that assertion
[16:05:06] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "talking"!= refuting all your bulshit lies for hours sadly enough
[16:05:12] <leah> 2) i will not admit anything, nor apologize

[16:06:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I will not allow you to continue doing this games though
[16:06:13] <leah> yeah and i bet in your head, you think you're "protecting" other people from me right?

[16:07:45] <leah> how is andrew?
[16:07:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and a lenghty post was written on the forum
[16:08:00] <leah> i chose not to reach out to him because he made it clear he doesn't want to talk to me
[16:08:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> indeed I spoke with all you past victims

[16:08:40] <leah> andrew is no worse off than befroe i fired him from the project
[16:08:51] <leah> his life was shit before that point. i might have hurt his ego but that's it

[16:09:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> it was not your position to fire anyone
[16:09:11] <leah> he told me and also said on his public blog post, that he's a food service worker
[16:09:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "his life is none of my business, though" it actually is the moment you lied and ofuscate his plead to expose your activities
[16:10:04] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again lies have consequences and sadly Andrew because of your deception was ostracized from the moment
[16:10:05] <leah> i didn't obfuscate it though
[16:10:11] <leah> i even addressed his criticism publicly
[16:10:14] <leah> on libreboot.org
[16:10:18] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> not to speak the personal pain and agonia you cause dhim
[16:10:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> oh really so why this you wrote the resignations page?
[16:10:36] <leah> i deleted my article abuot it after the libreboot 20210522 release though, because all it really spoke of was about the crappy build system rewrite
[16:10:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> now offcourse removed :x
[16:10:44] <leah> which the 20210522 release announcement covers adequately
[16:11:02] <leah> if you actually check the url of that article, it http301 redirects to the 20210522 release announcement
[16:11:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you lack empathy, deception is a terible adition
[16:11:29] <leah> the "resignations" article was redundant after that
[16:11:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> adiction, it only leads to even more lies, to cover previous ones
[16:11:49] <leah> i considered for a moment:
[16:11:56] <leah> he was gone at that point, presumably doing something else
[16:12:01] <leah> and people looking at the site didn't care anymore
[16:12:11] <leah> because a new release was out, and the project was(still is) ticking along fine
[16:12:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and cause s real psycological harm to people
[16:12:14] <leah> so i just cleaned it up
[16:12:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> bulshit
[16:12:29] <leah> lol why are you talking now about addiction?
[16:12:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you did premiditavely
[16:12:41] <leah> do you really think i caused him psychological harm?
[16:12:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you are adicted to lying dont you see
[16:12:48] <leah> seems like melodramatic twattle to me
[16:12:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> it
[16:12:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you use lies to coverup your previous lies
[16:13:11] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: but i never covered anything up
[16:13:16] <leah> i even addressed it publicly
[16:13:32] <leah> unapolagetically, but i did cover it. and i wished him well
[16:13:47] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: https://libreboot.org/contrib.html#andrew-robbins
[16:13:50] <leah> he is mentioned here
[16:13:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I fortunate enough to have a stable being and income, previous victims of your manipulation had to face much higher prices
[16:13:53] <leah> i'm not hiding anything
[16:13:57] <leah> i'm proud of what i did
[16:14:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and the hours I have spent refuting your lies manipulation and deception
[16:14:19] <leah> bullshit
[16:14:22] <leah> "higher prices"
[16:14:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that article was rewritten
[16:14:32] <leah> let me tell you about former contributors
[16:14:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> suring time this was happening you were being devious
[16:14:46] <leah> * paulk went to work for nvidia, and other companies. his life is great
[16:14:53] <leah> * swiftgeek is... swiftgeek. he'll be fine no matter what
[16:14:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and hidding the truth
[16:15:00] <leah> btw paulk left of his own accord
[16:15:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> to see your goals forward
[16:15:02] <leah> after the gnu drama
[16:15:26] <leah> * andrew... i mean, he'll be fine i think? he seems to be employed too
[16:15:40] <leah> (i've seen his linked in. he has a better job now and presumably makes more money. so meh)
[16:15:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is deceptive maniulative and abbussive and should not be accepted on a moement like ours
[16:15:53] <leah> * damo22 left out of frustration of the gnu 2016 stuff
[16:15:57] <leah> that's it i think
[16:16:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> money is irrelavant here
[16:16:05] <leah> plenty more people have contributed, and still do
[16:16:11] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: but isn't that the only issue?
[16:16:13] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but personal demage is what matter
[16:16:16] <leah> he wanted to do business with me
[16:16:23] <leah> and i still wanted to, even after my takeover
[16:16:33] <leah> as it happens, the deal i was arranging with him, i now have with someone else
[16:16:45] <leah> doing machines for me. in america
[16:16:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> even to myslef when you force me to was 2 hours of my day each die refuting all you crppy lies
[16:16:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> yu lies have consequences
[16:16:55] <leah> i saw it not as a libreboot matter, but a business matter
[16:16:57] <leah> also
[16:17:06] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: why can't he just make his own libreboot site, and own repo?
[16:17:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and you should really think how your actions affect others ;)
[16:17:11] <leah> under a name besides libreboot
[16:17:15] <leah> why can't he just do that
[16:17:19] <leah> if he really cared about his work, he'd do it
[16:17:25] <leah> he would fork and make his own project
[16:17:28] <leah> and i encouraged him to do that
[16:17:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hyperbolabsd is the focus now
[16:17:35] <leah> i even offered to help financially with setting up infrastructure
[16:17:40] <leah> and said i'd promote his work too
[16:17:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ounce that is completed and hyperboot funding arrives

[16:27:26] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: she's not
[16:27:27] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: your intention is to make me angry
[16:27:30] <leah> but you haven't
[16:27:32] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> lies lies , manipulationa and power greed
[16:27:37] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: stop

[16:27:41] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: i'm not using vitali64
[16:27:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just exposed you web of lies
[16:27:47] <vitali64> I'm using myself
[16:27:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that has been going on for 1 year now
[16:28:11] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: you know who's actually using me though?
[16:28:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> abuse of power
[16:28:18] <vitali64> me
[16:28:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> andconstant manipulation here
[16:28:21] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: all you've done is repeat the same assertion that i lied/cheated/abused etc, without backing it up
[16:28:23] <vitali64> i'm using myself
[16:28:31] <vitali64> exactly
[16:28:31] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: and you speak for others as though you have any real authority. you don't
[16:28:37] <leah> how dare you speak for andrew
[16:28:40] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: btw, try joining #nontel
[16:28:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> which obliges me to ckeep refuting all your nonsensicallies
[16:28:48] <vitali64> I've banned you on the matrix and irc side
[16:28:48] <leah> if you had any guts or courage, you'd bring him here
[16:28:50] <leah> but nope
[16:28:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> yeah exactly because it is the truth
[16:28:55] <leah> you insert your words into his mouth
[16:29:01] <leah> and you're crapping all over him in the process
[16:29:04] <leah> i never attacked andrew
[16:29:16] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sure leah take the ballon
[16:29:18] <leah> all i did was kick him off the project for being inactive. i wanted to do my own thing and bring in new contributors
[16:29:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the truth allways comes out
[16:29:22] <leah> and that's exactly what i did
[16:29:31] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: what you're doing is this:
[16:29:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and vitali will be faced your actions one day
[16:29:43] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: no
[16:29:51] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and relaise the major injustice he had participated and supported
[16:29:54] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: stop
[16:29:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> truth allways comes out
[16:30:04] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: vitali64 will never face any negative actions from me. because vitali64 is a good person, who doesn't troll or harass in my channels, and vitali64 is doing excellent work
[16:30:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I will not be the last person leah lies and manipulates bout
[16:30:20] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: yep, but you're not telling the exact truth
[16:30:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I can assure the overall movement of that
[16:30:30] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: yep, but you're not telling the exact truth
[16:30:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> just the sheer insistance here shows me that
[16:30:41] <vitali64> some of what you're telling is the truth
[16:30:48] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: so, if i understand correctly, all i have to do is prove you wrong by not doing the things you think i'll do
[16:30:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> instead of having some humility
[16:30:51] <vitali64> but then you add lots of lies to the truth
[16:30:56] <vitali64> making it pure lies
[16:30:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and admiting to her mistake
[16:31:15] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: you're also putting words to my mouth, NOW STOP
[16:31:23] <vitali64> and STOP CALLING ME VITALI
[16:31:29] <leah> vitali64: this is what he does. he inserts himself
[16:31:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the relaity is leah bans people that present decenting voices to her nnsensical points
[16:31:38] <leah> vitali64: be on guard. he'll probably come after you in the future
[16:31:38] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: nope
[16:31:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and offcourse she is very strategic to who to do this
[16:31:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because if she would do this to gnutoo 
[16:32:01] <vitali64> there are some of leah's opinions where I'm not ok with and look! I'm still not banned!
[16:32:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> she would automatically be ostracized from the movement
[16:32:16] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is all premeditated

[16:45:48] <gnoo> firmware in the os is good yeah but it should be free software, the ryf tries to distinguish between hardware and software kinda like that, what could _potentially_ be changed into free software must be free software; however, if there is no possibly of replacing it with free software, then it doesn't really matter
[16:46:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you lies have cased real pain and agonia in many previously silenced libreboot contributoers
[16:46:10] <leah> gnoo: yeah, i agree that the firmware should be free
[16:46:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> lies have consequences
[16:46:22] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: am I silenced?
[16:46:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and you should have empathy for poeple
[16:46:29] <leah> gnoo: my only argument is: if the firmware is baked into the chip, or uploaded by your kernel, it makes no difference: firmware is still firmware
[16:46:30] *** Joins: kts (~kts@103.73.237.221)
[16:46:39] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: you never contributed to libreboot
[16:46:39] <leah> i further argue that if it's non-free in either case, i'd rather it be in my kernel
[16:46:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> vitali64: not yet because you are still usefull for leah
[16:46:43] <leah> where i can see it. and hack it
[16:46:51] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: so you're using me

[16:47:18] <gnoo> except that one has the possibility of being replace either by good means or malicious ones
[16:47:20] <leah> actually
[16:47:20] <vitali64> that means you wait for me to do your work
[16:47:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> indeed because the moment I started contributing I was silenced
[16:47:28] <vitali64> that's using me
[16:47:30] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: vitali64 is not useful to me at all. but vitali64 is very useful to libreboot
[16:47:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and bulshit lies started spreading about me
[16:47:41] <leah> i don't profit from vitali64's work
[16:47:45] <leah> but vitali64 has great passion for what he does

[16:47:51] <leah> and does so
[16:47:52] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: probably because you're a troll
[16:47:53] <leah> and that helps others
[16:48:00] <vitali64> leah: EXACTLY
[16:48:03] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: if i only cared about myself, libreboot wouldn't exist or support as much hardware

[17:40:48] <Kaiod> leah: I personally, am completely against "Hero Worship" and see that it hurts the movement. Also, I feel that some have a need to always assimilate something to someone else, it can never be a collective work (as in fact it is done, no one does anything alone around here).
[17:40:50] <leah> it's not a replacement for ich9gen. but it can modify an existing gbe image. it works very well, and instructions are there for how to quickly dump just gbe from your chip, change the mac address and then reflash just the gbe region, with the new mac address
[17:40:54] <leah> it's rad
[17:41:02] <leah> the tool you want for that is "nvmmac"

[18:20:11] <Guest53> There is a proprietary game, that was released a few years ago, but is still in development.
[18:20:48] <Guest53> And I want to ask the devs, if they would like to release their program as Free Software under a Free licence.
[18:21:33] <Guest53> Now I was wondering: Is it possible to release such a program, that needs proprietary software (in this case the game engine Unity3D) to run, as Free Software?
[18:21:53] <Guest53> Under a licence like GPLv3+ ?
[18:27:21] <pkal> (Obligatory "not a laywer" notice) I think it should be possible, but it wouldn't mean much from a software freedom perspective, because you are still bound by a proprietary dependency.

[18:32:16] <Guest53> > I think it should be possible
[18:32:17] <Guest53> That's what I thought.
[18:32:17] <Guest53> Although I think, that I've read somewhere, that the build tools would need to be FS too. (But that might have been in context of the AGPL?)
[18:36:10] <jxself> Maybe you're thinking of the GPL's definition of "Corresponding Source"?
[18:36:11] <Guest53> > but it wouldn't mean much from a software freedom perspective, because you are still bound by a proprietary dependency.
[18:36:12] <Guest53> I know that too, but I think it having parts of an application as FS is still better than having none at all.
[18:36:12] <Guest53> Also I hope, that this might help convince other projects to release their games under Free licences too.
[18:36:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> AGPL is not possible
[18:36:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> even with GPL
[18:36:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you might want to use LGPL
[18:36:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> for starters
[18:36:58] <vitali64[m]> No, GPL ftw
[18:36:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Guest53: the issue here is the business model
[18:37:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ;)
[18:37:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> vitali64: that might not be possible given dependency
[18:37:19] <vitali64[m]> ^ I now hate this smiley
[18:38:04] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you shouldnt connect person with theri actions ;)
[18:38:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Guest53: basically what Im saying is if they open source they will be out of business under current traditional business model

[18:40:21] <Guest53> M3RELATIVISM[m] Well, the game had a more than successful kickstarter campaign. So money might not be the issue here.
[18:40:28] <jxself> It appears that they have already thought about this topic.
[18:40:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sustainability is a major aspect of copyleft
[18:41:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you need to present them a with a alternative business model compatible with GPL, that money is not gonna last for ever;)
[18:43:01] <Guest53> jxself Those restrictions only seem to apply to the Unity software itself (and not the game one is developing it with).
