[00:01:43] <Alexendoo> Not really, but in order for sorting to faster you'd have to somehow sort it without visiting some elements
[00:02:15] <AJTJ> I mean, the binary search is faster, so I imagine it's better to sort it first if you have to search through the array many tmes
[00:02:17] <AJTJ> times
[00:02:18] <systemfault> AJTJ: I don't know your problem but maybe you're using the wrong datastructure, maybe a Set would be better, I don't know

[01:22:56] <velix> Actually, I'm loading coordinates via AJAX and add it to a map. I don't want to re-add the IDs, which already have been drawn.
[01:23:08] <ThePendulum> I think there might be some confusion between arrays in PHP and arrays in JS
[01:23:15] <velix> So I've got a lookup set now, to check: "have I been added already?"
[01:23:22] <velix> If it's on the set: don't add it.
[01:23:36] <ljharb> velix: sure, a Set or a Map makes sense
[01:23:43] <ljharb> velix: but also why would you ever need 40k coordinates on a map at once

[01:24:59] <kodah> does anyone know why the then() callback in this code isn't blocking? https://gist.github.com/kodah/a6dbdff83be205877aaef24c8a2d5021#file-settings-svelte-L18-L24
[01:25:53] <ljharb> velix: sure but you don't need 40k data points on the map at once for that
[01:26:02] <ljharb> velix: and you should be able to compute the clusters on your server
[01:26:06] <ThePendulum> velix: behold, an in vivo example of 'let foo', lol
[01:26:09] <ljharb> kodah: nothing async in JS is blocking
[01:26:39] <ljharb> kodah: ValidateProjectDir returns a promise. that promise must be awaited or `.then`d to be able to react to the work it's doing
[01:26:56] <ljharb> kodah: and handleInput is an event handler, and event handlers can never respond asynchronously to things, they have to be sync
[01:27:04] <ljharb> kodah: so you might be in a bind.
[01:27:23] <kodah> hm, crap
[01:27:54] <ljharb> kodah: you can not async validate on the frontend.
[01:27:58] <kodah> any ideas on how I can do this differently? i want to validate the text in that field on:blur
[01:28:16] <ljharb> kodah: you can do it, but you can't do it synchronously, which means you can't prevent an invalid value from being sent to the server
[01:28:25] <ljharb> kodah: so, first, make sure all validation is done on the server; client validations are just fluff.
[01:28:36] <kodah> ah, gotcha
[01:29:05] <velix> ljharb: True, Pre-Processing would be better. But it needs to reload on every zoom in then.
[01:29:25] <velix> ljharb: But with way less points.
[01:29:25] <ljharb> velix: no it doesn't, it just needs to make an ajax call

[01:39:54] <velix> Ah no, doesn't work: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'geometry')

[01:40:59] <Alexendoo> velix: entries gives you [key, value]

[01:43:01] <systemfault> velix: What do you want? What is the type of .features?
[01:43:28] <Alexendoo> So you can do const [key, poi] of Object.entries(...) if you care about the key as well, if you don't you can use Object.values()
[01:43:41] <ljharb> velix: use array methods, with Object.entries()
[01:43:44] <ljharb> velix: don't bother with a loop
[01:44:01] <velix> Alexendoo: yes, this works.
[01:44:14] <velix> ljharb: I'm not a frontend guy... all those => confuse me :D

[01:44:26] <ljharb> !iterations @ velix
[01:44:27] <jellobot> velix, ECMAScript's Array contains a number of built-in methods for iteration (e.g., map, reduce, every, some, filter, and forEach). They relieve the need for manual iteration, provide better abstraction than a `for` loop, and make it clear what your iteration is doing. See https://gist.github.com/ljharb/58faf1cfcb4e6808f74aae4ef7944cff
[01:44:36] <ljharb> velix: and you don't have to use arrow functions if you don't want to. just functions.

Using my same environment, creating the repo, installing, and then running tests succeeds if I start the process in /tmp, but not if I start the process in my ~/personal/ directory.

[11:12:00] <johncs> I think I'm very close on the trail of my bug now. Figured I'd share one more progress bit because it's quite juicy: I have found that if I run `yarn test:coverage` in a copy of Vue.Draggable that has never had `yarn test:coverage` run successfully before, and I am underneath my ~/personal directory, I will get the errors. However, if any of these
[11:12:00] <johncs> conditions aren't met, I won't get the errors. **Just renaming my personal directory to persona is enough to stop the erorrs**, as is any other name I've tried. Ridiculousness.

[12:12:46] <efdee> you're in a much better place today
[12:14:40] <thykka> lots of good things have happened to JS since 2001
[12:15:46] <parv> How does one test, experiment with Angular|Vue|React? Via web browser, CLI?
[12:16:36] <thykka> one of the easier ways is to use create-vue-app or similar
[12:17:03] <thykka> those'll set up the boilerplate for your chosen framework, usually including a test framework

[12:18:32] <fweht> i have a webgl shader which i want to show through a projector, if the projector has a different framerate than the laptop (will check this), does `requestAnimationFrame`respect that or do i have to manually set it?

[16:47:58] <thykka> pagios, so the result would be [{ id: 1, name: 'a' }, ...] but without { id: 4, name: 'd' } ?

[18:17:38] <samsch> stenno, It's a pretty frequent mistake for newbies to make. If you already have a good understanding of JS, then learn about promises, you would probably not find it challenging. However, a lot of people come into JS and making an async request is something they want/need to do very quickly.
[18:17:54] <stenno> fair i guess
[18:18:13] <samsch> Also, if you're used to the magic or non-async nature of other languages, it can be confusing.
[18:18:53] <stenno> not arguing that the concept of promises is complex
[18:21:51] <stenno> if i wanted to know if someone understands the concept of promises, those questions would not be what i would have asked

[18:35:05] <silly> ah
[18:35:41] <stenno> because javascript tries to imply the types and the '+' prefers string over number
[18:35:50] <stenno> (more or less)
[18:36:13] <banana_> also in javascript operators have operations based on the operand type
[18:36:27] <stenno> binary + here asks 'if the left side is not a primitive, make it one'
[18:36:41] <stenno> and so toString gets called on date
[18:37:01] <stenno> but binary - asks to coerce the left side into number, not string
[18:37:01] <pavonia> Oh, okay
[18:37:14] <banana_> for example if both operands are primitive type numbers for 1 + 1 it's addition operation but if one is a string than concentation operation is done and the non string operand is made a string
[18:37:43] <stenno> thats why i use template literals or .concat instead of + for string concatination
[18:37:49] <notchris> ^
[18:37:49] <banana_> n> 1 + 'haha'
[18:37:49] <banana_> hmmm
[18:37:50] <jellobot> (okay) '1haha'
[18:38:18] <stenno> string is always preferred before number

[18:38:30] <stenno> n> '10' - 1
[18:38:31] <jellobot> (okay) 9
[18:39:25] <banana_> yeah it depends on the operator used. like you said + and - dont have complete similar protocols based on the operand types
[18:39:28] <stenno> binary - is not ambigous
[18:39:57] <banana_> oh that's the term?

[18:40:57] <stenno> 'ambigous' just means that the symbol can have different interpretations based on context
[18:40:58] <banana_> "not ambigious" for math related operators means number operands are preferred
[18:41:05] <banana_> oh
[18:41:26] <stenno> for example + can mean concatinate strings, or it can mean add two numbers

[18:41:28] <jellobot> (okay) 2021-10-12T15:11:28.639Z

[18:42:12] <banana_> operand(s) type
[18:42:38] <qswz> just use Math.add

[21:10:39] <lf94> If I can make 30k / year after expenses I'll consider myself successful

[21:11:08] <lf94> It's not going to just be one product :)
[21:11:11] <theskillwithin> well thats more like 20k after taxes
[21:11:27] <lf94> Yep, and that's my "minimum amount to need to pay for everything"
[21:11:44] <lf94> I have a ton of savings to help also
[21:12:06] <theskillwithin> well i wish you luck

[21:45:08] <gitesh> Is javascript event-driven programming?
[21:45:37] <ljharb> gitesh: no
[21:45:54] <ljharb> gitesh: but web browser UIs work on events, so, also yes
[21:47:05] <lf94> web programming: yes event-driven
[21:47:09] <lf94> javascript as a language: no
[21:47:16] <lf94> (if that helps with understanding)
[21:47:39] <lf94> systemfault: theskillwithin: yes let me be clear, I don't expect to meet this goal year 1 :)
[21:48:07] <lf94> And yes, I do actually plan on patenting!
[21:48:13] <justsomeguy> JS is often used for event-driven programming, but the language itself does not require an event-drivent programming style. You can write a cli app for NodeJS that doesn't do anything with events.
[21:48:20] <lf94> But for the good of mankind: I will make my patent "free" after a year of sales
[21:48:53] <lf94> you can hold me to it
[21:49:15] * lf94 knows no one will give a shit about what he makes anyway
[21:49:18] <theskillwithin> you just said your not going to meet your goal in 1 year,  but now you say free after a year
[21:49:32] <lf94> no, *year 1*
[21:49:34] <efdee> don't wreck a guys dreams man
[21:49:36] <lf94> the first year
[21:49:46] <lf94> I may not patent anything for awhile
[21:50:02] <efdee> lf94: if you're up there preparing your venture into space as the next self made billionaire, remember there was one guy who believed in you

[21:51:20] <lf94> I like that
[21:51:41] <Rockwood> why do you like if 94?
[21:52:02] <lf94> because it makes you really evaluate if what you're doing is feasible / meaningful / etc
