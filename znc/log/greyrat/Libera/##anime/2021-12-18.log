[00:05:20] <MootPoot> what do you mean claiming - I remember you saying that lol
[00:05:23] <MootPoot> I was there
[00:05:24] <Awaru> then i thought that i was a gay black woman

[00:05:35] <emmeka> is that all it takes?
[00:05:38] <MootPoot> those must be some drugs

[00:21:09] <TsundereNoises> You still better watch yourself making fun of idol anime, pal
[00:21:46] <MootPoot> Idol anime is on the same level as sports anime
[00:21:49] <TsundereNoises> am I just going to be adding all their quit messages until the end of time?
[00:21:56] <MootPoot> or actually, no. that's a insult to sports anime
[00:22:07] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yes, it's occasionally great if you have cute enough girls in it
[00:22:09] <TsundereNoises> I agree
[00:22:20] <MootPoot> sports anime is like 98% garbage
[00:22:21] <TsundereNoises> Saki is the best sports anime of all time
[00:22:23] <MootPoot> and 2% are gems
[00:22:29] <MootPoot> I dont know why
[00:22:35] <MootPoot> there seems to be no middle ground
[00:22:39] <MootPoot> its either trash or amazing
[00:22:42] <TsundereNoises> Idol Jihen had 1 really good episode out of 12, I feel like it was huge wasted potential
[00:22:47] <TsundereNoises> but I won't argue that it was a great show
[00:22:55] <TsundereNoises> wasted potential almost seems worse to me though

[00:23:28] <ImoutoBot> [title] hololive's Momosuzu Nene Makes Surprise Voice Appearance in The World's Finest Assassin Anime—Except in Mainland China - Interest - Anime News Network
[00:23:51] <Bco1981> Nene's distinctive voice can be hard at around the 3:05 mark of Crunchyroll's stream of episode 6. There is one particular region, however, where her performance and credit are missing: Mainland China. bilibili's stream for that region removes Nene's credit and the corresponding character. (Note that no alterations were made to the stream for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan users.)
[00:24:13] <TsundereNoises> wow
[00:24:27] <TsundereNoises> that is some deep level pettiness

[00:29:25] <Bco1981> In July, hololive's Shirakami Fubuki and Natsuiro Matsuri appeared as themselves in The Detective Is Already Dead anime, but their appearances were also removed from the bilibili streams (including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan)

[00:30:24] <Bco1981> brown hairThe character has brown hair., cyan eyes, idol, perverted, side ponytail, small breasts, virtual idol, virtual YouTuber
[00:31:23] <TsundereNoises> so it's all hololive, not just because of Nene's original costume or something
[00:31:41] <Bco1981> nope, it's anything that has to do with hololive
[00:33:31] <TsundereNoises> I like that Matsuri gets the perverted tag
[00:33:40] <Bco1981> :3
[00:34:32] <Bco1981> also nene Last month, she featured in Japan's Weekly Playboy list of "The Next Generation of Beautiful Women."

[00:37:15] <Bco1981> isn't that nextgen ?

[00:37:34] <Bco1981> true

[00:40:05] <MootPoot> Is there si somebody who deserves the perverted tag

[07:53:05] <davic> neither the owners nor the users has the direct control, the org has
[07:53:11] <MootPoot> so I'm partially looking foreward to this unemployment holiday

[07:54:58] <sentionics> MootPoot: the moment he loses his job or quits, he can usually spin up several interviews within 2 weeks and have a job (often at a higher salary) within a month.
[07:55:11] <MootPoot> damn
[07:55:16] <sentionics> To me though, that's a hassle to always have to deal with.
[07:55:18] <MootPoot> I've been talking to a few people on and off
[07:55:21] <MootPoot>  but outside of that
[07:55:24] <sentionics> My strategy is the complete opposite.
[07:55:30] <davic> kinda happy that libera went this way tbh
[07:55:42] <MootPoot> can I live in your basement davic 
[07:55:46] <MootPoot> I'll code for food 
[07:55:49] <MootPoot> and anime
[07:56:03] <davic> MootPoot: well
[07:56:06] <davic> I guess not
[07:56:12] <MootPoot> :|
[07:56:12] <davic> I dont have a basement
[07:56:14] <sentionics> I make just enough to get by on a long standing client, but then recruiters poke me off of my linkedin profile sometimes about opportunities and I say yeah sure, here's my resume if I'm feeling it.
[07:56:17] <davic> but the apartment complex do
[07:56:22] <sentionics> and I eventually land jobs.
[07:56:39] <davic> but I dont think they want you living in the laundry/entertainment rooms
[07:56:39] <sentionics> even though I don't usually actively try to.
[07:58:08] <davic> oh for fuck sake
[07:58:11] <sentionics> MootPoot: while you're looking for work, whatever free time you've got, slam a tech stack that's popular and just make toy projects. Anything, todo list apps, get slightly fancier.
[07:58:34] <davic> MootPoot: that fucking post is a fucking lie. Basically what andrew wrote that Rizon has is pretty much kinda what Libera has.
[07:58:39] <sentionics> That practice will prime you in that stack, and when you finally get interviews, you won't look like a noob.
[07:59:35] <MootPoot> well, I kind of already do C# and SQL stack mainly
[07:59:42] <sentionics> but yeah, the spam a 100 job applications trick does work. It's hard at the entry level, but it's a method my cousin believes in for sure.
[07:59:54] <MootPoot> I have done PHP and Larvel in the past
[08:00:04] <Urchin[emacs]> ever tried F#?
[08:00:11] <MootPoot> heard stuff about it 
[08:00:13] <MootPoot> never tried
[08:00:30] <MootPoot> although I am very familiiar with it
[08:00:38] <MootPoot> every time my code dosen't work I go "F#"
[08:00:52] <sentionics> MootPoot: There's tons of .NET mate. Spam the job applications for that, and prime yourself on the extras that you see them asking for on job listings. Ignore that they're asking for 20 different things under "requirements".
[08:01:21] <sentionics> More than half the candidates for junior level positions probably aren't even programmers anyway.
[08:01:47] <MootPoot> I think at this point I'd say I have ~2 years of actual experience doing things for real people
[08:01:57] <sentionics> So if you can just get yourself in an actual phone/video interview, you're in a good spot.
[08:02:11] <snake> Urchin[emacs], functional programming is a gimmick
[08:02:26] <snake> over hyped and inferior to OOP
[08:03:08] <sentionics> go in ready to do your best and fail, so don't be sad about fucking up interviews. Interview fuckups are great for you, they make you better. They make you think about what you're doing poorly, what you're saying that's making them grimace, and adjust for the next interview.
[08:03:12] <MootPoot> that one dude on YT did make a good argument against it

[08:04:32] <sentionics> I'm of the philosophy that most classes don't need to be classes. They'd be better off just being a module with functions.
[08:04:42] <MootPoot> sentionics: how much would you epxect to make as a 3 year old dev
[08:04:44] <sentionics> I refer to the file itself as a module.
[08:04:51] <MootPoot> 3 years of experience, not literally 3 years old lmao
[08:05:18] <sentionics> MootPoot: on the US market, you can spin that 3 years of experience as you being an intermediate level dev and ask for 60k
[08:05:23] <sentionics> or possibly more.
[08:05:32] <MootPoot> probably the same up here in canaderp

[08:06:31] <snake> maybe for a dime you get ten dozen LOL
[08:06:34] <sentionics> The great thing about asking for more than you're worth, is that even if you don't get it, you'll be making them discount off of that starting point you've stated, so you'll often still wound up with a decent offer.

[08:06:43] <MootPoot> sure, but what does that have to with OOP
[08:07:17] <snake> MootPoot, just because people are very vocal in their opposition to OOP doesn't mean they are right
[08:07:24] <MootPoot> sentionics:  so far in my life I think I've had like 400 resumes sent out but 
[08:07:25] <snake> i think they're blaming the wrong thing
[08:07:41] <snake> for their stress
[08:07:42] <MootPoot> snake: yes, I agree, but what does that have to do with OOP being good/bad on its merits
[08:08:26] <snake> MootPoot, sharing a 45 minute video isn't an argument
[08:08:27] <MootPoot> sentionics: I haven't gotten too many offers yet
[08:08:30] <snake> it's a conversation stopper
[08:08:31] <sentionics> and by "more than you're worth" I'm referring to your personal view of what you think you're worth. What you're actually worth? That's like, an opinion that can vary wildly depending on who you ask. Don't ask "what am I worth?". Ask, "what can I get them to pay me?" This is just business.
[08:08:57] <MootPoot> snake: I cant explain as well as he can , and I dont OOP that much 
[08:09:06] <MootPoot> all I really said was that he made a convincing argument
[08:09:08] <MootPoot> imo
[08:09:12] <MootPoot> anyway
[08:09:21] <MootPoot> sentionics:  so shoot for the moon eh
[08:09:53] * MootPoot is looking for jobs on linkedin
[08:10:24] <snake> OOP has many benefits like encapsulation, data hiding, and object composition for dynamic behavior and dynamic programming
[08:10:46] <sentionics> MootPoot: best advice though. Is be super pragmatic. Be very keen on bending to "the house rules" - their coding conventions, philosophies, etc. You're goal right now is to get a job and start making money. You can find your ideal job when you're sitting a little more pretty on your bank account.

[08:14:55] <sentionics> Try to avoid the trap of giving a timeline of your past. Instead speak to key moments in your past, not "I did this for a year, that for 6 months, etc." It should be "I worked on this big project x handling y and z, worked on project a and learned about b and c, etc."

[08:50:45] <PancakeMatsuri_> sentionics thanks
[08:50:47] <sentionics> I use honey when I do eat pancakes/waffles. It's not as bad, and I actually prefer the taste of honey over syrup.
[08:51:02] <sentionics> still, honey is lots of sugar too.
[08:51:06] <PancakeMatsuri_> honey is good, as well as jams

[08:51:54] <sentionics> (ethanol is a sugar, but... when I'm drunk, I don't get the same effect I don't think... or at least, I can't feel it)
[08:52:54] <sentionics> what happened to me to make me sugar sensitive was years ago, I briefly had a stint of panic disorder. I mean, panic attacks several times a week, multiple times a day, and just rough general anxiety.
[08:53:04] <amigojapan> sentionics: ethanol is alchohol
[08:53:17] <sentionics> amigojapan: and also a form of sugar
[08:53:54] <sentionics> I stopped drinking energy drinks, sodas, anything with caffeine, hell, even juices. only drank water. As my heart was already racing all the time, I didn't want any further stimulation.
[08:54:38] <MootPoot> kokoro doki doki
[08:54:44] <sentionics> I got over the anxiety/panic issues though, but my body adapted to not having lots of sugary stuff all the time. So when I do eat something super sugary, uncomfortable racing heart ensues.
[08:55:26] <amigojapan> Ouch

[09:02:00] <ButterNoodle> thats not how that works
[09:02:12] <MootPoot> cumming reduces weight

[09:03:35] <ButterNoodle> sentionics: you'd literally have to loose a considerable percentage of weight in a day after eating something to cause an insulin response..

[09:09:39] <sentionics> I used to have some strong opinions about JS. Not overly positive. But just negative enough I avoided node like the plague and only touched it on the front-end.

[09:10:39] <sentionics> But I'm embracing it lately though for web UI components. I really like what I've seen in Svelte so far.
[09:10:49] <MootPoot> yeah you mentioned Svelte 
[09:10:56] <MootPoot> the thing with JS is that I just HATE its syntax
[09:11:00] <MootPoot> its so....
[09:11:02] <MootPoot> loose
[09:11:12] <ButterNoodle> oh shit
[09:11:25] <MootPoot> its like a butthole so loose you cant feel what's going on until you plow into a turd
[09:11:35] <ButterNoodle> I think I just seen one of my team mates positions listed.. wonder if he's leaving the account
[09:11:41] <sentionics> gods though, have to do a bit of brain-switching to keep track of when you're coding in the context of CommonJS or ECMAScript 6 or above
[09:12:40] <sentionics> modules.exports = { ... } vs just line by line calling "export let some_var = x;  export let some_funct = () => ..."
[09:12:53] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: got time for that arch install thing?
[09:13:14] <ButterNoodle> uefi?
[09:13:18] <MootPoot> ye
[09:13:25] <ButterNoodle> lemme mod that script to fit
[09:13:40] <sentionics> I'm a node noob so, uh. take my words as such.
[09:13:46] <MootPoot> can you point out where you changed it 
[09:13:53] <MootPoot> I wanna know what's actually going on
[09:14:44] <ButterNoodle> yes
[09:14:53] <ButterNoodle> I gotta hack 2 scripts together
[09:15:36] <MootPoot> I used fdisk, was it to erase a NTFS drive
[09:15:54] <MootPoot> then used the same commnads you gave me earlier - altered though
[09:15:59] <MootPoot> to make the partitions the same
[09:16:16] <MootPoot> was gonna look up a guide on how to rsync it
[09:16:33] <MootPoot> fortunately the arch wiki does have a guide on migrating or backing up ur OS
[09:16:38] <sentionics> rsync eh? sometimes you gotta settle for lftp.
[09:16:47] <MootPoot> I have no idea what I'm doing
[09:16:56] <MootPoot> I learn from breaking shit

[12:54:34] <Bco1981> Nene's distinctive voice can be hard at around the 3:05 mark of Crunchyroll's stream of episode 6. There is one particular region, however, where her performance and credit are missing: Mainland China. bilibili's stream for that region removes Nene's credit and the corresponding character. (Note that no alterations were made to the stream for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan users.)

[13:41:22] <jessedesu2> All that youtube-dl on ph

[14:02:05] <Sadale> zoidberg, yeah that's the problem. I wouldn't be surprised if the USB pendrive is powered by the same tech as microSD card especially if microSD card tech is less expensive due to popular demand.

[14:03:13] <Sadale> zoidberg, Just because it look different (e.g. USB chip contains the black IC packaging) doesn't mean that it isn't the same tech as microSD. And you could easily fit a microSD flash chip into the big-ass USB pendrive chip package.
[14:03:26] <zoidberg> Sadale: can you read that on number 4? that's the flash memory
[14:03:49] <Bco1981> it's litteraly different tech, look at the pictures
[14:03:50] <Sadale> zoidberg, yes. But do you know what's inside after you remove the cap of the flash memory?
[14:04:06] <zoidberg> Sadale: yeah but then would you still call it usb drive?
[14:04:07] <Bco1981> look at the links we have posted
[14:04:15] <zoidberg> yeah, I've seen
[14:04:40] <Bco1981> Sadale: 
[14:04:42] <Sadale> My point is that just because it looks different doesn't mean that it's different tech.
[14:04:53] <Sadale> Under the hood the silicone could be the same.
[14:05:02] <Sadale> (except that the pendrive has a USB interface of course)
[14:05:20] <zoidberg> yes, it's all just sand, Sadale :p
[14:05:26] <Bco1981> microsd card does not have micro chips for it's memory where it stores the data.
[14:05:40] <Bco1981> that is litteraly what a proper usbstick does
[14:05:56] <Bco1981> it save tha data in the microchip that a microsd card does not have
[14:06:25] <Sadale> I'm actually not so sure about that because microSD can handle interfacing with computer with at least two protocols (namely I2C and another protocol that I haven't used). Let me look that up tho.
[14:07:06] <zoidberg> sd cards use spi afaik Sadale 
[14:07:14] <Sadale> oh yeah SPI. not I2C
[14:07:16] <Sadale> I misremembered.
[14:07:18] <zoidberg> spi is easy
[14:07:36] <Sadale> It's either SPI and there's an alternative protocol for that as well. SPI easier to use tho
[14:07:51] <Sadale> But the alternative protocol offers better performance.
[14:08:16] <Bco1981> performance yeah, but that won't help keep your data safe
[14:09:18] <Bco1981> Sadale: have you even looked at the links we have posted ?

[14:11:19] <Sadale> It isn't exactly a chip. I'd imagine it's the kind of chip-on-board that doesn't have the black case packaging.
[14:12:15] <Sadale> And that's actually what I'm trying to say. Just because it looks different doesn't mean that the tech is different. Just because there're black chips (the controller chip and the memory chip(s)) on USB pendrive doesn't mean that such thing doesn't exist on microSD.
[14:12:50] <Bco1981> true, that will just have to be on the host... thing
[14:12:58] <Bco1981> but i doubt the rpi has that
[14:13:34] <Bco1981> rpi sdcard speedtest suggest it does not
[14:13:50] <zoidberg> ofcourse you'd need a controller
[14:13:55] <Bco1981> get nowhere near 104mb/sec
[14:14:19] <Sadale> As for the actual truth on if they're the same tho I really won't know until I actually design one, or I'm bothered enough to actually look into that on the internet. :P
[14:15:05] <zoidberg> so wait, both usb drives, the real ones I mean and sd cards both have nand flash chips right?
[14:15:21] <Bco1981> there is no chip on the sdcard

[14:16:47] <zoidberg> do we have any vlsi engineers here?
[14:17:47] <Sadale> It appears to me that both USB and microSD has controller in it based on the info I've searched for online so far. The form factors are different tho. But we really can't tell that if there's a difference between the quality of the microSD controller/NAND and the USB pendrive controller/NAND.
[14:18:16] <zoidberg> Bco1981: in the old sd cards they did though, I'm not sure how they are doing it on new ones
[14:18:17] <Bco1981> The illusion of a contiguous, reliable storage media is crafted through sophisticated error correction and bad block management functions.
[14:19:05] <zoidberg> Sadale: THERE IS NO MICRO CHIP INSIDE!!!
[14:19:24] <Sadale> zoidberg, There is. Check the link I've just posted.
[14:19:37] <Sadale> It has a microcontroller inside. At least for the one that I've shown you.
[14:20:24] <zoidberg> Sadale: they are the old ones, I see them on wikipedia too
[14:20:35] <zoidberg> see the link Bco1981 posted
[14:20:47] <Bco1981> that die shot shows there is a tiny micro controller
[14:20:50] <Bco1981> Flash memory is really cheap. So cheap, in fact, that it’s too good to be true. In reality, all flash memory is riddled with defects — without exception.
[14:21:21] <Sadale> zoidberg, who said that the new one doesn't have a controller tho? Even if it doesn't have a microcontroller I suppose that it should have a controller or interfacing chip of some kind, no?
[14:23:02] <zoidberg> Sadale: yup, it's impossible not to have one. I am wondering if the vlsi has advanced so much to build nand flash along with controller on the same ic
[14:23:46] <Sadale> What I'm thinking is that if the microSD tech is cheaper, I'd just stick in the microSD controller into USB pendrive to save cost.
[14:23:47] <zoidberg> things were so simple back then: flash memory, controller, crystal
[14:23:50] <zoidberg> heh
[14:24:21] <Bco1981> the cells still die on the sdcard
[14:24:24] <Sadale> I mean who wouldn't do that? It's about cost efficiency :P
[14:24:29] <Bco1981> usb controller or not
[14:24:45] <Bco1981> it's about data safety
[14:25:04] <zoidberg> yeah, honestly no one cares enough, at least the customer doesn't
[14:25:09] <Sadale> I guess SSD is probably still far safer tho. It's meant to be used like that.

[14:25:44] <Bco1981> true, ssd is the winner, then usbpendrive and lastly sdcard
[14:26:02] <Sadale> aw it's going into circle. xD
[14:26:29] <Sadale> basically you think that usb pendrive is better than microSD. I think that I'm not so sure on that. 
[14:26:50] <Bco1981> true... because the sdcard is the least realible...
[14:26:52] <Sadale> I honestly don't know tho. I'm just guessing.
[14:27:53] <zoidberg> Bco1981: one website says 100,000 read/write cycles for sd card is the limit

[14:28:15] *** basuotoko_ is now known as basuotoko
[14:28:19] <Bco1981> Flash drives have write cycles that range from 3,000 to 100,000 depending on the technology used on the device. The flash cells start to wear down once the limit is reached and this will affect the functionality of the device.

[14:29:48] <zoidberg> yeah
[14:30:04] <Bco1981> i would say, probably not.
[14:30:08] <Bco1981> an expensive maybe
[14:30:17] <zoidberg> maybe the cheap ones will start to have problems from 3000th cycle
[14:30:30] <Sadale> I'm not trying to say that SD card is better than usb pendrive. What I'm saying is that we can't tell that USB Pendrive is better than SD card. That's because they're both meant for the same kind of workload.

[18:09:27] <emmeka> zoidberg that won't help him if he's having network trouble :P
[18:09:33] <soun> sorry lol
[18:09:35] <Miyukii> you can look up decent free bouncers on the znc wiki
[18:09:43] <Bco1981> i think you can get free droplets? small vms' hosted on the internet.
[18:09:46] <soun> but idc about that now
[18:09:56] <emmeka> soun this isn't discord, there's no thing that you're logging into that's saving all this chat as its happening
[18:10:15] <Bco1981> mine does
[18:10:18] <emmeka> everything is live, you're either connected or not. All an IRC bouncer does is host your connection separately
[18:10:28] <Miyukii> if you want a modern like chat experience and you're fine with self-hosting, quassel is very much like that
[18:10:28] <emmeka> so that it can save everything itself, as its own service
[18:10:48] <soun> i think some script that will auto join all the channels the moment i start my client will be good but again that question belongs to client specific channel
[18:10:49] <emmeka> Bco1981 you're not helping me explain it :(
[18:10:55] <zoidberg> emmeka: he put computer to sleep that is disconnecting from internet
[18:11:02] <Bco1981> emmeka: i'm not using a bouncer
[18:11:05] <Miyukii> it doesn't mess up the marker line upon opening a client like hexchat does with bouncers
[18:11:08] <emmeka> soun you shouldn't need a script for that, all clients can do that by default.
[18:11:40] <soun> hmm im dumb lemme read the docs once again
[18:11:49] <soun> thanks btw emeka
[18:11:57] <Bco1981> this is an irssi client running in "screen" on a remote VM i ssh into. hence i'm on 24/7 even if i'm not.
[18:12:10] <emmeka> Bco1981 so, a bouncer.
[18:12:18] <emmeka> just DYI'd
[18:12:25] <emmeka> moving on
[18:12:26] <Bco1981> and i have all log for what has been going on, because i'm always on.
[18:13:07] <zoidberg> I used to be into being online all time
[18:13:12] <zoidberg> but now, meh
[18:13:16] <Bco1981> saving hilights, and all the naughty links :3
[18:13:51] <emmeka> I've never wanted a bouncer personally. I don't want people pinging me while I'm away and then having to pop in and read assloads of backscroll just to find 1 offhand mention
[18:14:24] <emmeka> part of the joy of IRC is the way it's always live and sort of ephemeral
[18:14:44] <Bco1981> and people talk about webcomics inhere... hilights bco...
[18:15:07] <emmeka> we're all just blasting text out into the either for anyone to catch by various means, and either someone is there to catch it or someone is not

[18:21:42] <newbie2021> surnames "Mc" "Mac" "O'" - then you are Irish
[18:21:51] <newbie2021> and many others
[18:21:59] <SummerSkies> newbie2021 answer me 
[18:23:02] <darkwitch> anime is an old irish tradition
[18:23:04] <emmeka> newbie2021 I mean that's not even correct.
[18:23:22] <emmeka> newbie2021 Mac- is usually a Scottish highlander surname, Mc is usually Irish.
[18:23:45] <newbie2021> emmeka: it can be either
[18:23:47] <emmeka> not to mention, most people with Irish surnames are aware of the Irishness of their surname, so why the factoid
[18:23:50] <SummerSkies> newbie2021 go fuck yourself
[18:23:56] <emmeka> SummerSkies be nice.
[18:24:58] <Bco1981> i guess he is just testing his irish-ness...
[18:25:32] <newbie2021> Did you guys watch Highlander movie? Classic. Anime is pretty good too

[18:33:09] <soun> ok the autojoin works!
[18:33:09] <newbie2021> emmeka: there are no connection, man.
[18:33:16] <newbie2021> Mac means "son"
[18:33:24] <emmeka> yes... in Gaelic...
[18:33:33] <emmeka> but anyway, you're in the wrong place, friend
[18:33:34] <soun> SummerSkies: but i see 188 nicks.....
[18:33:48] <SummerSkies> soun right before you joined
[18:33:51] <SummerSkies> I mentioned another channel
[18:33:54] <newbie2021> You are making up things, man. How you can be more ridiculous than that? emmeka 
[18:34:15] <emmeka> this is a really weird troll
[18:34:55] <newbie2021> emmeka: you don't even know what "troll" means, aren't you? You are like 10-years old child first time in internet. I was like you in 2002, maybe
[18:35:17] <SummerSkies> emmeka yes, I snapped because I was offended from being ignored, because I haven't had my coffee yet. but also, it was very evident that this is a troll
[18:35:43] <SummerSkies> this is the most literal and direct communication there is, and it will be 20 minutes now that we haven't gotten a single straight answer from this user
[18:35:48] <newbie2021> You are stating wrong "facts" that you made up and then say that a person who says that you are wrong is a "troll"
[18:35:49] <emmeka> you're the guy with the nick newbie2021...
[18:36:18] <emmeka> but what exactly did I make up, even. You said <newbie2021> surnames "Mc" "Mac" "O'" - then you are Irish. This isn't even true. Mac- is usually Scottish, Gaelic in origin, only occasionally Irish by way of Ulstermen.
[18:36:23] <SummerSkies> anyway my feed is clean of it
[18:36:47] <newbie2021> You said 2 times that Macs are highlanders
[18:37:01] <newbie2021> Also, "Mac" can be Irish and Scottish. Either
[18:38:52] <emmeka> newbie2021 so anyway, why are you still here.
[18:39:17] <newbie2021> emmeka: do you know what's "flame" is?

[18:46:17] <emmeka> Vinland Saga, Bco1981.
[18:46:23] <emmeka> haven't seen it? it's pretty good.
[18:46:24] <Bco1981> hm
[18:46:30] <Bco1981> no, it's on the list
[18:46:43] <Bco1981> might get to it in 3-4 years
[18:47:21] <newbie2021> emmeka: There was a guy named Conn of Hundred Battles
[18:47:25] <zoidberg> vinland saga god damn good
[18:47:27] <emmeka> for an anime focused mainly on dumb over the top seinen action battles, it put a lot of attention to detail into the time period
[18:47:34] <newbie2021> do you realise how bad ass you must be to get a name like this? emmeka 
[18:47:39] <newbie2021> you will never be like that

[18:48:35] <zoidberg> emmeka: the character development in vinland saga is something else, isn't it? The characters are wonderfully written. 
[18:48:38] <MootPoot> wonder if there are more shows like GK and vinland

[18:50:34] <newbie2021> How hard it must be to write scripts?
[18:50:35] <MootPoot> was it malfoy from harry botter
[18:50:36] <emmeka> Askeladd was well written, but idk about the main character. His motivations and actions are sort of stupid.
[18:50:56] <MootPoot> or emmeka well, it is a 8 year old
[18:50:58] <zoidberg> true MootPoot 
[18:50:58] <MootPoot> or 12
[18:51:00] <MootPoot> something
[18:51:06] <newbie2021> I like all those stories about college students that wrote their script in college and big movies were filmed by their script
[18:51:18] <emmeka> Malfoy gets redeemed at the end, though

[18:52:54] <MootPoot> Game of Thrones
[18:53:04] <emmeka> I haven't read the manga, so idk. just from the first season his actions are sort of ridiculous. like they try to make Askeladd into this complicated father figure to him, but it never quite sticks to MC
[18:53:46] <newbie2021> I read manga
[18:53:56] <emmeka> he's obsessed with a singular goal for years and does things which make very little sense to achieve it, because he's manipulated, even though he's aware of it
[18:54:18] <newbie2021> emmeka: he's a kid... you are ridiculous
[18:55:22] <emmeka> yeah but he doesn't really behave like one. idk. to me he's the weak point of the series. thankfully, it mostly doesn't focus on him. he's just basically present for most of the plot.
[18:56:00] <newbie2021> emmeka: what is your surname btw
[18:56:07] <newbie2021> i will tell you about your ancestors
[18:56:19] <newbie2021> I am the Historian
[18:56:31] <emmeka> you don't need to tell me about my ancestors, nor would my surname tell you anything. also, it's rude to ask people their real names on IRC.
[18:56:31] <newbie2021> The Keeper of Stories
[18:56:32] <zoidberg> you can't ask such things in irc 
[18:56:43] <newbie2021> but i can
[18:56:54] <MootPoot> emmeka is the son of the forest baguttes
[18:57:10] <Bco1981> sure you can ask. but don't expect an answer.
[18:57:10] <zoidberg> ah yes, you can but it is rude to ask
[18:58:07] <zoidberg> we have been here for over 10 years, we know a lot about others but not their names 
[18:58:24] <newbie2021> zoidberg: i didn't see here
[18:58:31] <newbie2021> you*
[18:58:43] <newbie2021> i know other guys, but not you
[18:58:45] <zoidberg> not the place they live but the kind of person they are, their likes, dislikes and overall what the person is like
[18:59:04] <emmeka> newbie2021 most people on IRC don't want to be doxxed, and prefer not to reveal their real names. I'm not very particular about it, some people here do know my real name, but straight up asking someone you just met today for it is a breach of etiquette on IRC.

[18:59:32] <zoidberg> I'm mostly known as saganman
[18:59:33] <newbie2021> emmeka: yeah, but i don't care
[18:59:42] <MootPoot> another breach of etiquette is asking to talk about the irish newbie2021 
[18:59:53] <zoidberg> saying I don't care doesn't mean it's okay newbie2021

[19:01:25] <zoidberg> why do people say that?

[19:58:55] <emmeka> MootPoot you're being taken advantage of. Never accept any deal from an employer which goes along the lines of "we're going to start you out at [insert unacceptable pay/conditions here] and then *later* give you a raise"
[19:59:10] <MootPoot> well, they never promised a raise
[19:59:31] <MootPoot> this is a fixed length contract - as a intern, I can't complete my degree without it
[19:59:39] <MootPoot> I have to do it
[19:59:46] <newbie2021> MootPoot got screwed, ew?
[19:59:52] <emmeka> oh, you've been enslaved by student coop bullshit. unfortunate.
[19:59:58] <zoidberg> MootPoot: You can't be employed and also be an intern. If you're employed, you should get paid like normal employee. If you're intern, it's different. What interns do is learn stuff at companies and develop their skills. Interns are paid, yes but it's not supposed to be a job. It's different.
[20:00:21] <emmeka> it's actually against the law in this country for an intern to do productive work for the company.
[20:00:21] <MootPoot> well, I'm out of it come febuary
[20:00:31] <newbie2021> Lol, MootPoot is a slave... Disgrace
[20:00:41] <emmeka> if you're being paid, it'd better be above minwage.
[20:00:41] <zoidberg> emmeka: true, there are laws in America too.
[20:00:42] * MootPoot sighs
[20:00:52] <emmeka> if not, you can sue, which is fun

[20:01:07] <MootPoot> according to asking others 
[20:01:14] <emmeka> MootPoot is on the higher end above minimum wage.
[20:01:14] <zoidberg> most internships are actually illegal
[20:01:28] <emmeka> yeah. internships are 90% wage theft.
[20:01:43] <emmeka> I've never actually encountered one that was legitimate and lawful
[20:01:45] <zoidberg> exactly, you get what I am saying emmeka 
[20:02:10] * MootPoot is a job virgin
[20:02:22] <emmeka> MootPoot learn a valuable lesson here: employers are you enemy.
[20:02:56] <emmeka> they will steal from you by any means necessary, they will try and squeeze every bit out of you that they can for the least they can possibly manage
[20:03:05] <emmeka> and when at all possible, will skirt the law.
[20:03:10] <newbie2021> MootPoot if you would've known your ancestors - you wouldn't let somebody disrespect you like dat
[20:03:22] <Bco1981> what skirt ?
[20:03:33] <zoidberg> lol
[20:04:04] <newbie2021> Back at the day people were paying with blood for an insult
[20:04:08] <newbie2021> good old dayz
[20:04:49] <emmeka> MootPoot if you're actually being paid below labour law standards, and doing productive work for your employer, then here's what I'd suggest to you. Complete your internship for the sake of your degree. Then, immediately after, file a claim with your provincial ministry of labour.
[20:05:09] <emmeka> without a union, that's the best you can do, trust the government to investigate. It's a process that takes months.
[20:05:12] <MootPoot> nah, I'm making like
[20:05:14] <MootPoot> 20/h
[20:05:22] <zoidberg> damn
[20:05:24] <MootPoot> min is 15
[20:05:39] <MootPoot> afaik normal job should have me making 35 or 40/h
[20:05:41] <emmeka> oh. well, then you're just taking a shit deal for no good reason, really
[20:05:56] <MootPoot> well, have to wrap up the degree
[20:06:02] <MootPoot> so just 1.5 months more

[20:45:50] <Matt|home> hello.
[20:45:50] <MootPoot> the BIOS is too finicky to be useful
[20:45:58] <Sadale> zoidberg, no idea. It's a controlled experiment and I'm sure that something's wrong with my cable-connected internet. That being said, it does offer nice thruput as long as I don't play real time network game.
[20:46:25] <Sadale> zoidberg, Mine is 5GB for a year. But it's super cheap.
[20:46:57] <Sadale> zoidberg, I barely need mobile data. That's why I choose this data card.
[20:46:59] <MootPoot> play netrunner
[20:47:11] <MootPoot> or even better play with your imouto
[20:47:17] <Sadale> I only need it for emergency when I'm outdoor. That's like very very rare :P
[20:47:31] <emmeka> Sadale sure it's the ISP and not the router, though
[20:47:32] <SummerSkies> who here likes bleach
[20:47:32] <Bco1981> MootPoot: you mean games right?...
[20:47:41] <MootPoot> Bco1981: totally, sure
[20:47:45] <MootPoot> :3
[20:48:02] <Sadale> emmeka, yep. I've ruled out the router. I tried connecting my computer with the modem directly without passing thru the router.

[20:48:25] <zoidberg> mine is also super cheap Sadale, I pay around $4.5 for 82 days which includes free calls and sms along with 2GB/day 4G internet
[20:48:25] <Sadale> emmeka, oh wait. What if it's the ethernet cable? Not likely. But let's not rule out that.
[20:48:47] <Bco1981> yeah bro is smashing alright...
[20:48:59] <Sadale> zoidberg, me jealous :(
[20:49:26] <Sadale> zoidberg, mine's like $10 for a year 5GB limit. After 5GB the plan vanishes.
[20:49:33] <emmeka> Sadale did you try multiple devices
[20:49:49] <zoidberg> Sadale: I bet the problem is somewhere in middle. You'll have bad time if your data is going through places like Houston where routers are badly kept, lots of data loss.
[20:49:52] <emmeka> Sadale could be an issue on the PC's end to, with receiving UDP packets?
[20:50:22] <Sadale> emmeka, doubt so. I used mobile tethering and it tethers the data to PC via USB.
[20:51:02] <zoidberg> MootPoot: is that real or is that a meme?
[20:51:15] <MootPoot> pretty sure its a meme edit

[20:54:23] <zoidberg> why? managed are lot more costly MootPoot 
[20:54:44] <MootPoot> I have a bunch of networked devices 
[20:54:47] <MootPoot> would make it easier
[20:54:51] <MootPoot> I think
[20:55:24] <zoidberg> so you can regulate the bandwidth and stuff?
[20:55:31] <zoidberg> yeah, I guess
[20:55:34] <MootPoot> create Vlans and stuff
[20:55:44] <zoidberg> I see.
[20:55:54] <MootPoot> I have a unmanaged 8 port swtich already
[20:55:59] <MootPoot> works fine - but I need another swtich
[20:57:43] <MootPoot> maybe I should ask butter
[20:58:12] <Bco1981> will probably say mikrotiq, should amoung the cheaper.
[20:58:15] <zoidberg> yeah
[20:58:40] <Bco1981> unless you want to worship satan an get hp or dlink
[20:58:50] <zoidberg> the prices of electronics are increasing because of shipping crisis and availability of parts
[20:58:53] <MootPoot> I was looking at a dlink
[20:59:04] <zoidberg> oh wait, you should ask Bco1981 
[20:59:11] <MootPoot> a 8 port unmanged is like 27 dollars
[20:59:15] <zoidberg> he is THE network guy
[20:59:19] <MootPoot> 8 port managed is 40
[20:59:25] <Bco1981> zoidberg: i use cisco, NOT cheap.
[20:59:26] <MootPoot> so about ~30 more

[21:01:55] <Bco1981> the 24ports are my "backbone" switches. they connect my apartment to my basement, they have 4 10gig fiber ports...
[21:02:05] <Bco1981> i need to buy that optical cable and get it done.
[21:02:25] <Bco1981> have the optical plugs already. just need the cable
[21:02:30] <zoidberg> you have setup at your basement?
[21:02:33] <Bco1981> yeah
[21:02:48] <Bco1981> have 2 pc's in my basement that run 24/7
[21:03:06] <Bco1981> the basment is about 100meters away in this building
[21:03:13] <zoidberg> then why 24 port?
[21:03:27] <zoidberg> what else is there?
[21:03:36] <Bco1981> was the only one i could get that was 10gig sfp+ and silent

[21:28:34] <ButterNoodle> mine started blocking udp voice to blizzard yesterday..
[21:28:41] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, my imouto complained that a real time network game stuttered a lot.

[21:29:07] <ButterNoodle> will it make soylent?
[21:29:20] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: yea idk what ISPs are doing
[21:29:31] <ButterNoodle> *time to vpn
[21:29:53] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, Today I decided to look into this issue seriously. What I've found is that the ISP I'm using is just fucked up. It has random packet drop issue with a drop rate of up to 4% over a period of 5 minutes. Meanwhile, my USB-tethered mobile data has a drop rate of 0.04%.

[21:30:43] <Sadale> Anyway this ISP is actually good for downloading stuffs or watching vid. It has decent bandwidth without data cap. And it's real cheap.
[21:30:46] <ButterNoodle> yea I expect packet loss over wireless.. u have no medium

[21:33:26] <newbie2021> Do you have a dream?
[21:33:36] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, what it is?
[21:34:01] <ButterNoodle> u know how u cant fragment ssl packets because of tcp sequencing in the crypto?
[21:34:16] <Sadale> oh? I didn't know that
[21:34:41] <ButterNoodle> u run into that when pmtu is broke and u have dis similar mtu across a network
[21:35:18] <ButterNoodle> I ran into it at my old job years ago.. when they were running guest wireless across gre tunnels to a dmz... then route mapping it out the internet
[21:35:51] <ButterNoodle> when u route map and force next hop it breaks path mtu autodetect
[21:35:55] <ButterNoodle> then it fragments
[21:36:00] <ButterNoodle> *I knew this
[21:37:14] <ButterNoodle> so I have a nginx box that is the front end to a bunch of telemetry stuff I run at the house, and I was poking around the network config and adding some new IPs for another inbound link and wondered why I had the mtu on that box set to 1500.. when everything in that dmz is 9000 because bigger better
[21:37:26] <ButterNoodle> set it to 9K and walked away
[21:37:41] <Sadale> :o

[21:43:50] <ButterNoodle> u came in mid conversation. so when u have hosts in different network segments with different mtu settings the router does path mtu discovery and forces a workable size to not fragment packets
[21:44:00] <Satin> oh i see XD
[21:44:17] <ButterNoodle> unless u are manipulating packets by forcing a next hop through policy based routing
[21:44:22] <Satin> i c
[21:44:33] <ButterNoodle> then pmtu is borked mostly.. at least in the cisco world
[21:45:34] <ButterNoodle> so u have to hard set the mtu ur feeding on side to not cause frags. which only matter if ur dealing with ssl over tcp and sequence matters.. ig its more about packet checksum also
[21:45:56] <ButterNoodle> cause checksum is sent in the header, and if it gets fraged then its bad
[21:47:47] <HeTo> a TCP application does not know the TCP segments, let alone the IP fragments that the stream gets sliced into
[21:48:10] <ButterNoodle> wut
[21:48:16] <Satin> do you guys have any reccomendations for CLI file explorers?
[21:48:27] <ButterNoodle> u tryin to be real specific here HeTo..
[21:48:33] <ButterNoodle> frags break https
[21:49:00] <Bco1981> Satin: mc
[21:49:12] <HeTo> ButterNoodle: I'm just saying, fragmentation can't break TLS or HTTPS, well other than with the packets not going through at all
[21:49:27] <HeTo> Satin: CLI specifically or TUI?
[21:49:32] <Satin> Bco1981: is it better than GUI or GUI better?
[21:49:36] <ButterNoodle> frags happen at layer 3 which breaks ssl integrity of the payload at layer 6 or whatever

[21:49:44] <ButterNoodle> bullshit
[21:49:48] <ButterNoodle> do some reading on that

[21:50:40] <ButterNoodle> to fix it?
[21:50:59] <ButterNoodle> in my case.. dont run jumbo frames and route maps
[21:51:29] <HeTo> there could be broken routers that break PMTU discovery and then nothing goes through if you try to send TCP fast enough, but it's not specific to TLS
[21:51:32] <ButterNoodle> in the real world with lte and sdwan.. find the lowest common denominator of an mtu where u can
[21:52:19] <ButterNoodle> HeTo: u just confirmed what I said partly.. but the fast enough thing doesnt matter because tcp has a sequence number
[21:52:32] <ButterNoodle> it is specific to any packet that has a checksum
[21:52:48] <ButterNoodle> like tls ssl whatever
[21:52:54] <HeTo> well and apparently the DF bit on outgoing packets is also settable via a socket option
[21:53:06] <HeTo> checksum has nothing to do with it
[21:53:26] <ButterNoodle> it does when it reached the application broke
[21:53:42] <Bco1981> Satin: it's faster to navigate
[21:53:45] <ButterNoodle> and DF doesnt matter in 99% of cases because pmtu fixes it
[21:54:03] <HeTo> it doesn't reach the remote at all
[21:54:09] <ButterNoodle> and in cases where it does matter.. the path is already broken

[21:54:49] <ButterNoodle> Satin: neverending nutt november file managre
[21:55:04] <Satin> ButterNoodle: lol i hate myself because i got reminded of that when i first saw the name
[21:55:06] <Satin> fucking internet
[21:55:15] <ButterNoodle> yes internet horny
[21:56:24] <HeTo> Satin: anyway, CLI is command-line interface, it means you use, well, commands on a command line to interface with the computer.  TUI is what some people use of terminal applications that are not used via a command line but via user interface elements
[21:57:00] <Satin> oh
[21:57:42] <Satin> Probably TUI but I'd like to hear reccomendations for both tbh. 
[21:57:50] <HeTo> on a Unix, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to ask for a CLI file manager, because you're supposed to use different programs for different tasks (like moving or copying files), and Unix already has a bunch of those already
[21:59:34] <MootPoot> ebay bidding is anxiety inducing
[21:59:48] <HeTo> so why TUI and not GUI? do you need something you can run remotely through ssh (not that you can't do X forwarding over ssh but a TUI is lighter)
[22:00:52] <Satin> maybe in the future 
[22:00:58] <Satin> HeTo: i just want something keyboard driven
[22:01:21] <HeTo> even then though I'd suggest something that can use sftp and running the file manager locally instead
[22:01:35] <Satin> i've been using zathura and surely there's a way of  jumping around files better
[22:01:42] <Satin> zathura for pdf stuff*
[22:01:52] <Satin> and now i'm getting tired of using nautilus in gnome with my mouse
[22:01:55] <HeTo> a GUI app could be keyboard-driven
[22:01:58] <Satin> yeah
[22:02:04] <HeTo> besides which, a mouse has its uses
