[01:07:28] <merpnderp> hmm, query string. thanks.
[01:07:28] <entuland> the URL api will give you all those bits and pieces

[01:08:06] <entuland> I have that epiphany every other day, it's okay :P
[01:08:24] <merpnderp> This stuff needs to be passed to my api, so why wouldn't I just split on /\?(.+)/[1] and then add that to my api call.
[01:08:50] <merpnderp> lol
[01:09:04] <wroathe> merpnderp: Huh? you just need the unparsed query string?

[01:09:49] <merpnderp> that's better than my split

[01:13:07] <merpnderp> wroathe: nearly done.
[01:13:23] <wroathe> merpnderp: Did that info I gave you end up checking out?
[01:13:38] <merpnderp> wroathe: just mapping the callback to the frontend SPA so that it can pass the auth token to the backend so that it can get the id and access tokens :)
[01:13:44] <merpnderp> wroathe: heck yeah.

[03:42:28] <cthulchu_> it does. I have no stuff stored on the client side
[03:42:51] <gehn> you may not have attempted to explicitly store anything, but that doesn't mean chrome hasn't cached something you're unaware of
[03:43:01] <cthulchu_> I cleared caches

[03:54:59] <theskillwithin> wroathe is there like a common browser extention people use to debug web sockets?
[03:55:24] <wroathe> theskillwithin: No idea. If the browser is telling you the connection failed, it's not going to be something the browser can help you debug anyway
[03:55:35] <wroathe> theskillwithin: you need to follow the trail of breadcrumbs back to the server

[03:56:24] <wroathe> cthulchu_: Did nc tell you that?
[03:57:26] <wroathe> theskillwithin: So yeah, you'd start by verifying that foo.corp is a valid domain name on your network, with something like dig @my.corp.dns foo.corp
[03:57:37] <cthulchu_> no, I just tried to connect to localhost instead of the external hostname and it just worked. Then I checked the hostname...
[03:57:47] <wroathe> theskillwithin: And if that reports back a DNS record, you'd then test the connection on the specific port using something like nmap or netcat (nc)
[03:58:01] <wroathe> theskillwithin: nc -z foo.corp 443, for example
[03:58:12] <wroathe> theskillwithin: And that'll tell you have you can establish a TCP connection on that port or not
[03:58:39] <wroathe> theskillwithin: If you can't, you have your culprit, and you know that you need to check out why that server isn't listening on that port.

[04:57:31] <entuland> not sure I understand the "get mad at" - I'm just trying to help you divide the problem you have into smaller parts
[04:58:44] <entuland> let's assume polling every second is okay, and let's assume that you can simply keep the data in a variable of your running page (you probably don't need any local storage)
[04:59:16] <entuland> start by just storing the data in a variable that persists outside of the scope of that check
[04:59:26] <entuland> something that you can compare against
[05:00:08] <entuland> once you have that reference, add some conditional checks to compare the old data with the new data and only act if the check passes
[05:00:59] <entuland> finally, check the docs to know how to play a sound with javascript in a page, such as this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio

[05:17:32] <nedbat> wroathe: can I ask one more question about https://gist.github.com/JustinChristensen/652bedadc92cf0aff86cc5fbcde87732 ?  Why do you return an array from on() ?
[05:18:20] <entuland> no, I have hard time understanding why you're calling .ready() inside of that success callback and I truly don't understand what's the purpose of the variable "i" there
[05:18:27] <wroathe> nedbat: In the case where they provide a selector it lets them get back the elements that were selected
[05:18:37] <wroathe> nedbat: Instead of making it a one shot
[05:18:37] <nedbat> wroathe: I see.
[05:19:09] <wroathe> nedbat: Nothing about that is final btw. I just hacked it together real quick to win an argument :P
[05:19:16] <wroathe> nedbat: You're free to change whatever you want
[05:19:31] <nedbat> wroathe: it's good, and i've already made it a little less compact, just to match my usual style

[05:26:22] <entuland> if you are asking why it's not working or how it's not working, no, I didn't bother even thinking about that
[05:26:30] <wroathe> nedbat: Yes, yes you are
[05:26:34] <wroathe> nedbat: Event delegation is the tits
[05:26:38] <entuland> because I already see stuff that shouldn't be there
[05:27:35] <wroathe> nedbat: I actually sent that to you to solve that problem you were working on that would've been PERFECT for event delegation
[05:27:44] <wroathe> nedbat: If memory serves you were binding and rebinding event listeners for draggable elements
[05:28:50] <nedbat> wroathe: yes, which i am no longer doing.  but mousemove and mouseup events need to be handled on document, not on the draggable div anyway.
[05:29:57] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[05:30:01] <wroathe> nedbat: In the browser events start at whatever element you were interacting with and they "bubble" upwards through the document, triggering any bound event listeners that match that event's type on the way to the document root.
[05:30:37] <wroathe> nedbat: When you have lots of similar elements sibling elements that need to handle the same kind of event, it's almost always better to bind that event listener to those elements' common ancestor, instead of on the elements themselves
[05:30:56] <wroathe> nedbat: That's event delegation.
[05:31:19] <nedbat> wroathe: right, i understand the concepts
[05:31:35] <wroathe> nedbat: The event object that gets received by that ancestor element will have currentTarget set to the ancestor itself (the element with the handler), the .target will be the element that originated the event, and with this script .delegate will be the element you meant to handle the event for.
[05:31:54] <wroathe> nedbat: Ok. Cool. Well, here's hoping you have a need for the sel argument soon :)
[05:32:43] <nedbat> wroathe: i guess if i had multiple draggable divs, then one handler on document, with a delegate of div.draggable would be a use.
[05:33:06] <wroathe> nedbat: Yup. Although you don't necessarily need to bind it to the document. You could have a "draggable container" div.
[05:33:32] <nedbat> wroathe: and that is better than using "div.draggable" as the handler if you dynamically create those divs
[05:33:33] <wroathe> <div class="drag-container"><div class="draggable">...<div class="draggable">...
[05:33:41] <wroathe> nedbat: Yes
[05:33:55] <wroathe> nedbat: No need to micromanage the object's life cycle and event handlers. They can come and go as they please.
[05:34:01] <nedbat> wroathe: that last aspect (creating divs) may be the thing I don't have that makes this seems less compelling.
[05:34:17] <wroathe> nedbat: Yup. Potentially.
[05:34:30] <wroathe> nedbat: Although your script was using removeEventListener for something IIRC correctly
[05:34:33] <wroathe> nedbat: What, I don't remember
[05:35:02] <nedbat> wroathe: it was adding listeners for mousemove and mouseup in the mousedown handler
[05:35:02] <wroathe> nedbat: Generally speaking if you see someone calling addEventListener or removeEventListener in a loop it sets of warning alarms that there may be an opportunity for event delegation
[05:35:32] <nedbat> wroathe: now i have those handlers always set, but they check if a drag is in progress
[05:36:03] <wroathe> I would argue that it's probably still a decent idea to use event delegation there. Even if the object set is relatively static.

[09:49:32] <theskillwithin> kids aren't the ones at risk
[09:49:38] <ljharb> everyone is at risk
[09:49:59] <ashnur> kids can be vectors too, which exposes everyone
[09:50:01] <ljharb> "risk" isn't just "death", includes the long term neurological damage that even the folks who had mild symptoms are likely to have.
[09:50:20] <ljharb> iow, if you had covid, even if it was mild, evidence suggests you'll be stupider over the nest 3 or 5 decades
[09:50:33] <ljharb> and americans don't exactly have a surplus to burn there
[09:50:38] <theskillwithin> the vaccine has risk of neurological damage as well
[09:50:42] <ljharb> lol no it doesn't
[09:50:45] <ljharb> it has zero risk of that.
[09:50:46] <theskillwithin> because it doesn't stay local like they intended
[09:50:54] <ashnur> ljharb, i think the idiots are those who have maintained and still maintain that scientists were all right from the beginning, there was no miscommunication, there was no miseducation, scientists and doctors can be trusted, and everything should be 100% fine if idiots like trump voters and racists wouldn't hate everyone
[09:51:03] <ashnur> bit circular, but that's what i think
[09:51:05] <ljharb> if you say "shedding" then you're quoting people that have no idea what they're talking about, because that's not a thing.
[09:51:20] <ljharb> ashnur: that's a tough sentence to unpack but i think i agree
[09:51:39] <theskillwithin> ljharb if you have 3 hours to spare https://open.spotify.com/episode/7uVXKgE6eLJKMXkETwcw0D?si=de757fdcef224fd5
[09:51:43] <ljharb> it's a thing for shingles. it's not a thing for people vaccinated against covid .

[09:52:09] <ashnur> ;D
[09:52:13] <ljharb> lol and joe rogan to boot
[09:52:13] <ashnur> probably a joe rogan podcast
[09:52:23] <ashnur> yeah, didn't even had to open the link
[09:52:41] <ljharb> there is zero risk for neurological damage from the covid vaccine, because you're not getting the disease in any form.
[09:52:57] <ljharb> the disease, however, has a very high likelihood of causing long-term neurological damage in everyone who gets it.
[09:53:27] <ashnur> ljharb, when you say there is "zero risk" of anything, you are part of the problem though. There is no significant risk compared to the virus and everything to be gained, but it's also never zero risk
[09:53:29] <ljharb> you don't have to get the vaccine but you also don't get to be thought of as "not dumb" if you don't (assuming eligibility and no medical blockers)
[09:53:41] <ljharb> ashnur: i mean, biologically it's as close to zero as you can get
[09:53:43] <ashnur> you can get infected by the fucking injection, just to say one thing
[09:53:51] <ljharb> ashnur: obv nothing is 0% or 100% just because of how physics works
[09:54:05] <theskillwithin> its easy to be so certain when you reject listening to different people
[09:54:05] <luiserebii> this is #javascript, no? ^^
[09:54:09] <ljharb> ashnur: but there's plenty of things that are so statistically unlikely that 0% is close enough
[09:54:10] <ashnur> right, but precision is important when you are telling someone they are wrong, because if you are not precise, it's easy to be accurate
[09:54:21] <ljharb> theskillwithin: joe rogan isn't a doctor. he doesn't get an opinion.
[09:54:39] <ljharb> ashnur: you're wildly underestimating the necessity of hyperbole
[09:54:45] <ashnur> but if you say zero risk, it's way too precise, it leaves you open to too many retorts, that's just what i see
[09:54:51] <theskillwithin> ljharb lol of course not
[09:54:55] <theskillwithin> wtf?
[09:55:10] <ashnur> zero risk as a hyperbole is like saying 'my code has zero bugs'
[09:55:13] <ljharb> theskillwithin: so get me a link that's from someone who's not "0% reputable" in the realm of biology or medicine
[09:55:21] <ashnur> way too stupid :D
[09:55:28] <ljharb> not a talk show, but like an actual study or article summarizing one
[09:55:45] <theskillwithin> well theres a phd in evolutionary biology and a doctor on that podcast ljharb
[09:56:01] <ljharb> anyways all the evidence shows that if you get pfizer or moderna, at least, you're more protected against covid and all its variants than almost all vaccines humanity's ever invented can protect you against things.
[09:56:10] <ashnur> ljharb, i can help with that podcast, i am actually familiar with Kory
[09:56:27] <ashnur> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Kory#COVID-19_controversies
[09:56:28] <ljharb> so if you have the opportunity and don't, you're basically turning down one of the best things in human history. which is incredibly stupid.
[09:56:46] <ashnur> they claim ivermectin is miracle and good for everything
[09:57:04] <ljharb> but sure, get all worried about red eyes and coughs
[09:57:32] <ashnur> and I actually met Bret Weinstein once in London, nice guy, but he is desperate to uncover situation with DISC

[10:10:36] <theskillwithin> saying a ton of shit that I wasn't arguing against in the first place isn't grounds to turn down my source of material you never watched
[10:11:17] <ljharb> sure, but "it's joe rogan" is sufficient grounds
[10:11:27] <ljharb> (for anything beyond "entertainment", ofc)
[10:12:16] <ljharb> but fair, i was reacting to the implication that you aren't vaccinated since in july 2021 in the US there's no reason anyone over 12 should be worried about covid (since even those who can't medically get the vaccine should be protected by all the people around them who are surely getting it)
[10:12:56] <ljharb> admittedly that's a ton of assumptions, so, my bad if any of them are wrong

[10:14:19] <ljharb> i laughed it off because i'm already sufficiently informed :-)
[10:14:30] <ljharb> you can't inform someone of untrue conspiracy theories
[10:14:49] <ljharb> all you can do is maybe uninform them :-)

[10:19:30] <ljharb> theskillwithin: science is also not "when most everyone believes something, definitely question it"
[10:19:58] <theskillwithin> therefor why ignore some information
[10:20:01] <ljharb> not that the masses are always right, but at some point the minority has exponentially more burden of proof
[10:20:05] <ljharb> nobody said ignore
[10:20:19] <rannnn8888> ljharb what u mean shouldn't be how i cheack if the old data === to the new data if i not reassigining a new variables ?
[10:20:38] <ljharb> but there's plenty of choices that have enough evidence behind them that "waiting to consider alternate viewpoints" is dumb
[10:20:50] <ljharb> rannnn8888: use `let` if you want to reassign
[10:20:53] <ljharb> rannnn8888: like for `i`.
[10:20:57] <wroathe> Recently he had this kid on who was trying to give this attempt to demonize Fauci lip service. There's people who have been looking at Fauci like "Give me a reason" since this whole thing started, and this controversy around $600,000 is just silly.
[10:21:05] <ljharb> rannnn8888: but fix all the other things i mentioned, and make a codesandbox or jsfiddle.

[10:46:14] <ljharb> theskillwithin: it's 100% legal, and the vaccine is FDA approved
[10:46:15] <gkatsev> the FDA really should approve it fully already
[10:46:19] <ljharb> theskillwithin: "emergency approved" is still approved.
[10:46:31] <theskillwithin> not really
[10:46:36] <ljharb> all they did is take steps that are normally done in serial and do them in parallel. it's 100% identically as approved as every other vaccine in history

[10:48:12] <ljharb> it's idiotic to do anything different. this is just an emergency, so we stopped being idiotic for this one disease
[10:48:29] <ljharb> with any luck we'll keep this process for everything, because it's identically as safe but much more efficient
[10:49:18] <ljharb> and besides, the FDA says things aren't edible a week past their "sell by" date, which any consumer knows is bullshit
[10:49:21] <matsaman> anyway it's not like businesses are usually so dumb as to fire you for clearly illegal reasons when they can legally just say "we don't want you"

[10:54:58] <wroathe> That gist of that FDA article is that they haven't had time to review the data, and that there's research underway, but they're discouraging the public from taking the drug because the side effects can be serious

[11:03:59] <ljharb> ashnur: in early 2020 it wasn't a big problem
[11:04:07] <ashnur> well, it fucking was

[11:04:11] <ljharb> it ended up being, certainly
[11:04:19] <ljharb> but hindsight doesn't make doomsaying retroactively correct
[11:04:42] <ljharb> if countries had taken it seriously in mid 2020, even, things would have been fine. but many countries didn't.
[11:04:43] <ashnur> it was not hindsight when i said it in february 2020
[11:04:47] <ljharb> yes, it was.
[11:04:48] <wroathe> Fauci was in a hard place there. It's pretty well established that he was on a short leash with the current administration.
[11:04:51] <ashnur> or when scientists said it for decades before
[11:04:51] <gkatsev> what's your definition of "early" could also change whether it was a big issue then or not
[11:04:56] <ljharb> in february 2020 things were objectively still fine
[11:04:56] <wroathe> Err with that administration, I should say.
[11:05:05] <theskillwithin> false
[11:05:09] <theskillwithin> emails revailed that
[11:05:13] <ljharb> revealed what
[11:05:14] <ashnur> yeah
[11:05:25] <ashnur> ljharb, the info that you didn't get on twitter
[11:05:30] <ljharb> by "fine" i don't mean "there was no danger"
[11:05:32] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Huh? Talking about what I just said?
[11:05:36] <ljharb> i mean "it was all easily fixable"
[11:05:43] <ljharb> but the US, and many other countries, fucked it up.
[11:05:50] <ashnur> it was not easily fixable at all
[11:05:56] <ljharb> sars in 2011 was in a similar boat
[11:06:01] <gkatsev> in february itself it was mostly fine, particularly in the US, but officials knew it will get bad (and didn't act (particularly a certain individual))
[11:06:02] <ashnur> it required massive shutdown of the economy
[11:06:06] <theskillwithin> wroathe fauci wasn't on a short leash, he made his own decisions
[11:06:08] <ljharb> ashnur: which we had to do anyways
[11:06:10] <ashnur> that's the opposite of easy
[11:06:14] <wroathe> theskillwithin: What did the emails say? I haven't read them.
[11:06:16] <ashnur> yes, but it was not easy
[11:06:20] <ljharb> ashnur: if we'd done it in april or may, and consistently, things would have been fine.
[11:06:25] <ashnur> it would've been easy if we were prepared
[11:06:41] <ljharb> the US was prepared. then in 2018 trump shut down our pandemic response unit.
[11:06:50] <ashnur> which we were not because specialists in all fields pretend that their civic duties amount to voting a couple times and that's all
[11:07:08] <ljharb> ashnur: anyways are you holding a grudge because i didn't hop onboard your paranoia train in february 2020, almost 1.5 years ago?
[11:07:15] <ashnur> no, it's not a grudge
[11:07:19] <ashnur> it's an argument
[11:07:22] <ljharb> then it's irrelevant and stop talking about it
[11:07:31] <theskillwithin> and fauci and google now funding gain of function reserach
[11:07:33] <ljharb> it's almost july 2021
[11:07:34] <ashnur> lol, only grudges are relevant, right
[11:07:57] <ljharb> either way, vax status is everyone's business.
[11:07:57] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Hey, you, you said that the emails prove that that's false. What did they say that makes you say that?
[11:08:04] <wroathe> theskillwithin: You read them, right?
[11:08:20] <theskillwithin> wroathe false that trump was gagging him
[11:08:22] <ljharb> the only reason to keep it private is if you're medically unable, and you can reasonably answer "yes" there.
[11:08:28] <ashnur> ljharb, then expect people to lie as blatantly as you are using double standards
[11:08:45] <ljharb> ashnur: i do expect people to lie. that's why we need a verifiable system for it.
[11:08:50] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Did you personally read that? Or did you hear that from someone else who said they read them?
[11:08:50] <ljharb> ashnur: there's no double standard tho.
[11:08:55] <ashnur> there is too many
[11:09:05] <gkatsev> people are definitely lying. They'd rather lie and buying a fake vaccine card than just get the free vaccine.
[11:09:07] <ljharb> ashnur: it's a single standard. it's just that the same people who refuse vaccines are the ones who are most prone to lie, because they have no ethics in the first pkace.
[11:09:34] <theskillwithin> wroathe he himself insisted on it many times
[11:09:43] <ljharb> ashnur: because no risk to yourself from a vaccine (that most everyone already took) justifies risking infecting others.
[11:09:55] <wroathe> theskillwithin: You read the emails, and they said that, right?
[11:09:57] <theskillwithin> he clearly lied about masks.  and clearly lied about gain of function
[11:10:21] <ljharb> lol what?
[11:10:21] <ljharb> lied?
[11:10:28] <wroathe> theskillwithin: What lie did he tell about masks? I haven't heard this controversy yet...
[11:10:35] <ashnur> yeah, see, i like vaccines, i like science, i hate fucking conservatives and capitalists, but when you say things like that ljharb, i get even more angry, because we are supposed to both be for the betterment of eachother, but with this kind of ideological commitment that you bombard me with, it's impossible
[11:10:39] <ashnur> and i am done with that
[11:10:43] <ljharb> the advice certainly changed over time. that's called "science" not "lies"
[11:11:08] <wroathe> theskillwithin: It sounds like you're getting talking points from somewhere, where they're telling you that they read the emails and this is their interpretation of what they say
[11:11:10] <ljharb> ashnur: sounds like you're letting your revulsion to absolutism get in the way of your ideals ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:11:13] <gkatsev> the original recommendation from fauci was certainly not worded well, but I wouldn't say it was a lie
[11:11:19] <ljharb> of course it wasn't
[11:11:27] <ashnur> ... sounds like you think you know everything
[11:11:28] <ljharb> in some ways the recommendations have been wrong at times, of course
[11:11:40] <theskillwithin> wroathe he straight up admitted to lying about masks....
[11:11:41] <wroathe> theskillwithin: And I've been holding off on this, because I wanted to try and get to the bottom of the chain of information you've been following, but since you're not being forthcoming I'll move on to the next thing:

[11:23:21] <ljharb> ah k
[11:23:32] <sheetjs> what's the relationship between window and Window?
[11:23:45] <gkatsev> a capital letter :>
[11:23:50] <sheetjs> specifically
[11:23:54] <ljharb> sheetjs: what is Window
[11:23:57] <ashnur> one is common, general, other is specific
[11:24:08] <ljharb> maybe `window.constructor.name` or something

[11:24:13] <sheetjs> in chrome, Window is apparently a function
[11:24:14] <ljharb> if so it's just for debugging
[11:24:16] <gkatsev> huh one of the paypal founders was the US ambassador to sweden froim 2019 to 2021
[11:24:18] <ashnur> would be "Window" .no?
[11:24:36] <ashnur> ask in #v8 :D
[11:24:38] <ljharb> sheetjs: ah, Window is `window.constructor`
[11:24:43] <sheetjs> MDN references it
[11:24:44] <sheetjs> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showOpenFilePicker
[11:24:47] <sheetjs> var FileSystemHandles = Window.showOpenFilePicker();
[11:24:57] <sheetjs> why is Window recommended over window in that code sample?
[11:24:57] <ashnur> beautiful DOM
[11:25:04] <ashnur> mdn is a wiki
[11:25:07] <ljharb> sheetjs: presumably because it's not a property on window, but on Window.
[11:25:08] <ashnur> random people write random stuff in it
[11:25:14] <ljharb> sheetjs: window is an instance of Window.
[11:25:29] <ashnur> that's what i started with
[11:25:52] <ljharb> srsly tho that roth ira thing is brilliant, definitely going to do that next time i get cheap shares
[11:26:07] <sheetjs> thats not how it works
[11:26:14] <sheetjs> you cant contribute shares directly to a roth ira
[11:26:28] <sheetjs> it has to be an "arms length transaction", and there are proper ways to do that
[11:26:29] <gkatsev> unless you're thiel

[11:27:10] <ljharb> well then he'll lose his 5 mil
[11:27:15] <ljharb> so why do we care
[11:27:18] <sheetjs> more than that
[11:27:28] <ljharb> if he keeps it then it's retroactively legal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:27:30] <sheetjs> the roth structure lets you avoid the short term capital gains
[11:27:32] <gkatsev> unfortunately, the IRS says it's too expensive to audit rich people
[11:27:47] <sheetjs> so it's possible he ends up net negative if the IRA is deemed taxable
[11:28:01] <ljharb> he's got too much money for that to happen
[11:28:01] <sheetjs> yeah wroathe let's get back to JS

[11:29:13] <ljharb> or, people who make too much money, yes

[11:30:01] <ljharb> you can still do a roth 401k when you're over that tho, including matching

[11:30:31] <ljharb> theskillwithin: if you have 140k of income you can put $0 in a roth ira
[11:30:34] <sheetjs> if your modified AGI exceeds $140K

[20:42:06] <wroathe> Lately there's been this push to colocate as much as possible along with individual components, and I'm somewhat wary of that, because for large projects I think it's going to encourage lots of duplication
[20:42:54] <wroathe> There's this attitude that individual components are their own separate "apps", or something like that, which I think ignores the reality of bundling and shipping them into a browser runtime where they all share the same environment
[20:42:55] <ThePendulum> part of the point is to prevent duplication...
[20:42:55] <GreenJello> ThePendulum, with structure <A><B /></A>, if A has .foo { color: red } and B has a <div class="foo">Hello</div>, then that Hello will be in red

[20:47:30] <GreenJello> I haven't worked with it since vue 2
[20:48:08] <GreenJello> now it seems every element gets a data attribute
[20:49:06] <ThePendulum> so if B: <template><div class="foo"></div></template> and in A you do <template><B /></template> then .foo { color: red; } defined in A will indeed apply to that div, but not if B: <template><div class="bar"><div class="foo"></div></div></template> afaik
[20:50:33] <ThePendulum> not even sure if that's still true, but I don't remember a nested class ever having that problem unless of course you're not using <style scoped>

[21:05:08] *** Joins: raindrop (~raindrop@46.140.25.34)
[21:05:11] <GreenJello> css-modules solves that fairly cleanly, in that you can just pass the generated class name to the child as a prop
[21:05:48] <GreenJello> which also makes it slightly less invasive
[21:06:07] <ThePendulum> I imagine some of the confusion might indeed come from the fact it does indeed 'overlap the edges' if you will, and make the outer most component available for styling. so if you have Box.vue defined as <template><div class="box"></div></template> and then you do <Box><Box /></Box> <style>.box { background: yellow; }</style>, all your boxes will indeed be yellow because of that outermost class
[21:06:19] <ThePendulum> right
[21:07:18] <ThePendulum> what you can also do is <Box class="green" />, and then style .green as scoped CSS inside of Box
[21:07:28] <GreenJello> yeah, which conflicts with my react/css-modules approach of starting every component with a .root { style
[21:08:11] <GreenJello> is there some other way to refer to the root element of the current component, or do you just use a unique class there?
[21:09:10] <wroathe> Why not just have "valid" or "invalid" state classes defined and do <Box valid={true} />?
[21:09:14] <wroathe> (or w/e the state flag is)
[21:09:23] <ljharb> or `<Box valid />`
[21:09:42] <wroathe> passing class names down through the component hierarchy seems like it's coupling presentation and behavior together in an undesirable way
[21:09:57] <ThePendulum> don't think there's a specific class for that yet, I don't really use a particularly unique name, just .checkbox doesn't really cause any conflicts for me because if I am adjusting that in the parent component usually the point is that it shouldn't be overriding the local definition

[22:17:45] <DPA> I guess I could work around it differently. If I have a video player playing silence after a click, I can keep it across a manual page load, and then replace the source with what I actually want to play.

[22:37:07] <wroathe> I'm probably a bit too jaded. I've been on a few teams so far where, while we were teammates, it was pretty clear that our responsibilities towards each other started and stopped at dividing the labor and executing. My policy is to gather and maintain as complete a list of documentation sources within the organization as I possibly can, and to not put myself in a position where I expect teammates to
[22:37:13] <wroathe> educate me on the technical details of something
[22:37:35] <wroathe> If it's absolutely required that they do be able to sit down and explain it, that's probably an indication that the documentation is lacking anyway
[22:37:49] <wroathe> And so it could be said that the energy would be better spent sitting down together and shoring up the documentation

[22:54:55] <wroathe> Words cannot express how stoked I am that V8 supports coverage reporting, and that browser automation tools now make that seemless. This might be the single most important thing to happen to web application quality assurance in the last decade

[22:57:52] <prometh> cypress is still flaky
[22:58:13] <austincheney> wroathe, I wrote a test automation solution that runs in the browser for my personal application.  It has worked well for me and I trying to figure out how to adapt it to my employer
[22:58:21] <austincheney> https://prettydiff.com/share-test-automation.mp4
[22:58:46] <ljharb> the reason cypress is flaky is because of websites, not because of the tooling
[22:59:08] <prometh> ljharb: i dunno, i still have to add arbitrary delays
[22:59:29] <prometh> also, cypress' fake promises are dumb
[23:00:22] <wroathe> prometh: Well, I'm specifically talking about tools that use the Chrome DevTools Protocol
[23:00:49] <prometh> wroathe: i don't think cypress uses that for automation, does it?
[23:00:51] <wroathe> prometh: I'm unclear on if Cypress does. They seemed to indicate that they were trying to do it all in the same execution context through code injection or something like that
[23:01:08] <wroathe> prometh: I don't think so. The thing I'm excited about is things like Playwright and Puppeteer
[23:01:11] <austincheney> if you have to add a delay to test automation it sound only be for testing something that occurs due to a delay or else the test tool is too brittle
[23:01:11] <prometh> they rely on electron for their ui, at least

[23:03:20] <wroathe> austincheney: What's the underlying mechanism? WebDriver protocol? CDT? Or code injection?
