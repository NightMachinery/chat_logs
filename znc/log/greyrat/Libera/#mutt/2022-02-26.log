[01:44:47] <dfdx> Hi #mutt. I am trying to send an encrypted e-mail. I don't have my own public/private key, but I do have the public key of the person I am trying to email. After i compose my email, the help window tells me to hit "<Esc>k" to attach a PGP public key. But when I hit "<Esc>k" nothing happens. Am I doing something wrong?

[01:51:39] *** Joins: rogeliodh (~rogeliodh@rogeliodh.dev)
[01:55:00] <dfdx> I also try to hit "p", but again nothing happens. no menu shows up. 
[01:55:10] <dfdx> I am following the steps here: https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/-/wikis/MuttGuide/UseGPG
[01:55:14] <dfdx> I've downloaded and sourced .gpg.rc
[02:13:42] <dfdx> ah, nvm... I think i may have figured it out.
[02:13:43] <kevin8t8> dfdx: what does "mutt -v | grep CRYPT" show?
[02:14:14] <dfdx> -CRYPT_BACKEND_CLASSIC_PGP -CRYPT_BACKEND_CLASSIC_SMIME +CRYPT_BACKEND_GPGME
[02:14:20] <dfdx> I just recompiled mutt with gpgme support.
[02:14:32] <dfdx> now when i type "<Esc>k" I see it asks for a key ID
[02:14:40] <dfdx> not sure how to grab that. do I open another terminal?
[02:14:46] <dfdx> and run gpg --list-keys, and then copy/paste?
[02:15:03] <kevin8t8> to send an encrypted email, you don't want to use "<Esc>k"
[02:15:22] <kevin8t8> use the "p" menu and enable encryption
[02:15:52] <kevin8t8> then, when you go to send, mutt will may prompt you to confirm the key (unless it's fully trusted).
[02:15:57] <dfdx> i see, okay, let me try that.
[02:16:04] <dfdx> i have the public key showing up when I run "gpg --list-keys", fyi.
[02:16:29] <dfdx> so I hit "p", then "e", and then "y".
[02:16:38] <dfdx> (thinking 'y' would send the email)
[02:17:02] <dfdx> but i am in a new window now. with some kind of key, and the name of the sender and his email address?
[02:17:18] <dfdx> oohhhh... i'm selecting the key here.
[02:17:21] <kevin8t8> yes
[02:17:27] <dfdx> SMTP session failed: 554 5.0.0 Error: transaction failed, blame it on the weather: cannot upload attachment: [2001] Invalid input
[02:18:01] <kevin8t8> that's an SMTP server error.  not sure what that means.
[02:18:05] <dfdx> if it matters, I am using protonmail + hydroxide. 
[02:18:14] <dfdx> ugh, okay. thanks. let me debug some more.
[02:18:28] <kevin8t8> it might, but I haven't used protonmail so can't help :-(
[02:20:26] <dfdx> yeah, if i jsut want to send an email normally with an attachment, I get no problems...
[02:21:19] <dfdx> when I am selecting the recipient's public key, I get this message "ID has undefined validity. Do you really want to use the key? ([no]/yes):"
[02:21:28] <dfdx> how can I make it valid? perhaps I missed a step.
[02:21:37] <dfdx> sorry if this is more of a #gpg question.
[02:22:56] <kevin8t8> dfdx: yeah, that's about the web of trust.  mutt is just warning you that the web of trust doesn't consider the key to be fully valid.
[02:23:08] <kevin8t8> dfdx: don't worry about that for now.
[02:24:02] <kevin8t8> dfdx: if you sign their key, then it considers the valid.  but you're not supposed to do that without truly verifying the key is associated with the person you believe it to be for.
[02:24:36] <kevin8t8> dfdx: aka at a "signing party" or just meeting the person and confirming the fingerprint.
[02:25:33] <kevin8t8> dfdx: anyway, I belive protonmail is all about encrypting for you, so perhaps they don't like something.  you may have to check the protonmail faqs.
[02:28:05] <dfdx> yeah, I think this is a protonmail issue, that narrows it down at least. thank you!
[02:30:57] <kevin8t8> dfdx: you bet.  good luck.  there may be some protonmail users here too, so you may want to try again later if you are still stuck.
[02:35:14] <dfdx> thanks kevin8t8 
[02:35:26] <dfdx> while I have your attention... is there any way to speed up IMAP?
[02:35:59] <dfdx> besides the obvious: set imap_condstore, set imap_qresync, and set imap_deflate ?
[02:36:10] <dfdx> (I've set all 3)

[02:44:17] <dfdx> also, when I am encrypting an email withi "p", does that do in-line encryption or mime encryption? (not sure if I have the terminology right... but want to know if the email is sent inline or as an encrypted attachment).

[03:20:52] <kevin8t8> dfdx: those three are the ways to do it, along with imap_hcache of course.
[03:22:28] <kevin8t8> dfdx: you'll see in the menu whether it is doing (PGP/MIME) or (inline PGP).  GPGME only supports creaging PGP/MIME though.
