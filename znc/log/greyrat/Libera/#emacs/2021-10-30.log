[03:08:54] <rk4> '"looks like lisp" alienates most people' -> a sad condemnation of the current tech community!
[03:10:07] <technomancy> rk4: the way I see it there are way too many languages and technologies for anyone to develop enough of an informed opinion about it to make evidence-based decisions, so falling back on gut instinct is basically inevitable.
[03:10:55] <technomancy> like ... I don't want to learn nim because it's whitespace sensitive. is that petty? sure. is it bad? I dunno! I can't learn every language; I gotta find some way to pick which ones to focus on.

[03:12:11] <pl> rk4: the longer I deal with it, the more I think a crucial issue is that there's close to zero sanctioned on-the-job learning/training
[03:12:32] <rk4> i agree, but i think complete ignorance of lisp is a rather negative statement about your programming education
[03:12:40] <pl> and people base opinions on "viability of grabbing a developer out of thin air who can start on shit"
[03:13:03] <pl> rk4: in programming it's easy to dismiss "academia"
[03:13:17] <technomancy> pl: oh god I could go off on that
[03:14:05] <technomancy> like ... we had no trouble teaching people lisp when we were growing at a sustainable rate but now management wants to like ... triple the number of engineers, so we can't actually afford to train anyone. it's not healthy.
[03:14:06] <pl> especially when combined with regular "die off" of expertise, when you have cohorts entering "the market" who didn't have access to predecessor knowledge, or couldn't use it because they learnt on too-poor systems ("home computer" and early PC eras)
[03:14:23] <pl> technomancy: ... why do they want to triple the headcount?

[03:20:45] <technomancy> but complaining about the inevitable after it's already happened is pointless
[03:21:09] <rk4> meanwhile i have to fight yaml white spacing far too much :< and learn annoying syntactic details about DSLs like terraform, because no one knows what an s-exp is
[03:21:54] <rk4> each of these things needs its own parsing libraries, which in the case of .tf is only afaik in go, which makes it tedious as hell

[05:35:40] <jirido> when I want to set a value for a variable like  mouse-avoidance-mode, what command do I use? and how do I save it to make it permanent?  
[05:36:26] <TRS-80> jirido: Usually setq, but some modes have a command instead (consult docs).  Put it in your init file.
[05:37:40] <TRS-80> Yeah, this one says to use a function (do M-h v mouse-avoidance-mode <RET> and you will see.
[05:38:17] <jirido> ok
[05:38:42] <bpalmer> everybody should stop writing C and start writing c. So much more efficient.
[05:38:46] <TRS-80> then press tab to get to the function name <RET> will take you there
[05:39:35] <TRS-80> Also, that's pretty funny (never saw it before, lol)!
[05:39:54] <jirido> so when I set it in the init, do I just put it in side (setq )
[05:40:04] <TRS-80> you missed my point
[05:40:30] <bpalmer> jirido: C-h v mouse-avoidance-mode RET  (trs-80 wrote M-h but I suspect that was a thinko)
[05:40:56] <TRS-80> read the docstrings for the /variable/ mouse-avoidance-mode, as well as the /function/ of the same name, carefully.  And yes, bpalmer is right.
[05:41:23] <bpalmer> jirido: the relevant sentence, in particular: "Setting this variable directly does not take effect; use either M-x customize or the function ‘mouse-avoidance-mode’."
[05:41:48] <bpalmer> jirido: Just as C-h v gets you information about variables, C-h f gets you information about functions.
[05:42:21] <bpalmer> if you look at the function mouse-avoidance-mode, you'll see you can just call it with a parameter that is the value you want to use.

[16:11:03] <VG234> Good morning everyone. I have a question about using Emacs on Windows interactively. I'm trying to run git rebase -i. Emacs opens with a blank git-rebase-todo buffer. I think this is due to the fact that I'm running an interactive command against runemacs.exe on windows. 
[16:11:30] <thblt> atw``: it has units conversions at least, you could build on that.
[16:11:54] <thblt> VG234: does it behave differently with a different editor?
[16:12:17] <VG234> thblt: Yes, it works fine with vim.

[16:18:11] <VG234> thblt: The file git-rebase-todo does not get created. The buffer is supposed to contain the commits. I suspect it is passed to the editor. In the past, when using graphical emacs on windows, there was a file that could be used for interactive mode. Unfortunately, I never got that to work on windows10. 
[16:18:42] <thblt> VG234: but it's git that supposed to create the file.  
[16:19:50] <VG234> thblt: Running the command and then a find in the workspace does not find a file with that name or any *rebase* name.

[16:22:35] <VG234> thblt: As I understand it, you are correct and it should be in the .git/rebase-merge, but it is not there. 
[16:22:37] <thblt> Or the gitdir?
[16:23:02] <thblt> VG234: does runemacs.exe return when called with a file argument? This may be the issue.
[16:23:24] <thblt> VG234: git expects $EDITOR to return only after editing.
[16:24:05] *** Joins: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode)
[16:24:30] <thblt> If Emacs doesn't wait, then something like this may happen: git creates todo file, calls emacs, runemacs returns, git processes todo file (effectively doing nothing, since the file was unmodified), it deletes the file, emacs finishes starting up and shows an empty buffer with a new file.
[16:24:40] <VG234> thblt: If I run other commands like vc-resolve-conflicts in ediff or vc-dir, runemacs.exe works correcdtly. But, that is within emacs. I don't know of a vc-rebase command. 
[16:25:05] <thblt> VG234: try it by hand! call runemacs whatever.txt and see what happens.

[16:27:56] <VG234> thblt: It brings up a buffer named foo with no foo file created. As expected. 
[16:28:24] <VG234> thblt: Don't I need a server to run emacsclient? 
[16:28:57] <thblt> VG234: not my question.  What you want to know is how runemacs behave. Does it return immediately or only when you close Emacs?

[16:32:13] <thblt> VG234: then I guess the above theory is correct. Emacsclient should work, you just need to M-x server-start in a running instance

[20:18:51] <taeaad> I think that this directly relates to all programming languages in the sense that types are restricted. You can't just put any value into a variable. The same holds for sets if you think of them as variables. Type theory I believe will have Russel set analogues that are all related to the idea that a negative self reference "jumps between states", if you will.

[20:20:08] <taeaad> Gödel's proof of incompleteness of the arithmetic of natural numbers uses this same idea but instead of the value of the variable jumping around, you have the context being different. So it is "this sentence is false" as an external sentence vs. as an internal value of a truth table.

[20:23:34] <taeaad> artefact: Countably long, yes. But my issue with that is how do you define what you mean without opening up opinion? You can just replace that sentence with '123...n' and do substitution '123..n(n+1)' and then you have a bijection to natural numbers. It doesn't have any issues with being a set.
[20:24:30] <taeaad> Each number now just encodes <<"the sentence " >>.

[20:27:17] <taeaad> So the issue with Russel is that it goes much larger than strings that we can write down. If you assume the Russel version that you get in set theory. Otherwise, I think it is more similar to an automata, but don't take my words literally for that. But as far as automata are concerned, there are infinite sequences in finite automata. Cantor's main contribution to the debate was to settle the debate about whether higher infinities can be
[20:27:17] <taeaad> precisely studied or not. And at that point we were already studying real numbers. So it was a clarification of what we do in physics and in topology with the reals.

[20:33:01] <taeaad> You seem to need reals to handle the standard topics of topology: continuous functions, convergence and neighbourhoods. If you don't allow reals, I think the theorem says that all functions Q -> Q are continuous. And as far as Banach-Tarski is concerned, the odd thing about it seems to be that it *does* represent our physical reality. It's not some odd eccentric property of abstract mathematics, it seems like a property of the
[20:33:01] <taeaad> unverse. But atoms being indistinguishable is in spirit similar to what Banach-Tarski says. The takeaway is just that mathematics is more orderly than our arguments about it is. Russel's paradox is simply a statement about the fallacies of a naïve version of set theory. And the alternative of constructive mathematics seems to be something geometrical, not something necessarily logical. Proof by contradiction doesn't seem like a
[20:33:02] <taeaad> bad idea if we set out to form a consistent view (and time invariant view) on theorems.
[20:33:40] <taeaad> Russel's Paradox I believe was Russel rephrasing paradoxes that already existed in language but now in the setting of set theory.

[23:44:01] <grym> johnjay: my reviewer wasn't the team lead (i am, kinda), and he wasn't objecting so much as he was confused when he set a breakpoin and got a generator object instead of the numpy array he expected
[23:44:11] <blackbeard> johnjay: yeah I am a devops on a data science team, they use it a lot
[23:44:19] <shrysr> grym: how do you mean 'all of them! at once'? 
[23:44:20] <grym> blackbeard: pandas kind of accreted organically as people glommed features onto it 
[23:44:24] <grym> shrysr: ^ 
[23:44:26] <johnjay> blackbeard: is data science the science of data?
[23:44:47] <grym> shrysr: matplotlib is like this too
[23:45:34] <grym> (and for much the same reasons)
[23:48:50] <shrysr> i think ggplot2 is easier to work with than matplotlib
[23:49:06] <thblt> johnjay:  as opposed to science without data, eg math.
[23:49:31] <artefact> math doesn't have data?!
[23:49:32] <artefact>  
[23:49:59] <blackbeard> grym: I think pandas can use matplotlib as a backend for plotting 
[23:50:07] <grym> shrysr: https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/  
[23:50:26] <TRS-80> grym: duly noted
[23:50:28] <shrysr> grym: YEs! I have been using plotnine :)
[23:50:30] <grym> blackbeard: that is its default, because at the bottom of 90% of the python datavis ecosystem you'll find matplotlib 
[23:50:54] <grym> blackbeard: seaborn is an abstraction on top of mpl that uses dataframes; plotnine is another 
[23:51:05] <TRS-80> Orite, The Mrs have arranged for us to go and spend some time in meat space with some Normans, so you guise hold down the fort!  Cheers!
[23:51:08] <blackbeard> Ahh I see
