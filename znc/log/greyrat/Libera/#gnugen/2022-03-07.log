[14:34:44] <jonas[m]> Jup
[15:27:00] <Anyone[m]> Is there a distro we would like to install Saturday ? Or should we just propose several distros for them to choose 
[15:44:19] * Orbstheorem inconspicuously tried to raise a crowd while walking across the back: NixOS! NixOS! NixOS!
[15:48:27] <typedef[m]> Probably mint if we do it like last time
[16:37:09] <sparrowhawk[m]> We used to offer several for them to choose (Fedora and Ubuntu were favorites)
[16:37:24] <sparrowhawk[m]> and then people could come with a key of whatever they wanted for help (usually future Archers
[16:37:25] <sparrowhawk[m]> * future Archers)
[16:43:36] <jonas[m]> +1 for offering different distros and letting people choose
[16:48:10] <Anyone[m]> Me too üëçüèº
[16:48:53] <jonas[m]> Ventoy helps for creating USB-Sticks with multiple iso images to try in live boot
[19:38:17] <afontain[m]> note I won't be around Saturday
[19:38:37] <afontain[m]> It's always useful to have a Arch ISO in my opinion
[19:39:43] <afontain[m]> if only because it has a decent shell, `arch-chroot` and `efibootmgr`
[19:41:31] <afontain[m]> <typedef[m]> "Probably mint if we do it like..." <- It was Debian Cinnamon though
[19:41:53] <afontain[m]> > * <@roosemberth:orbstheorem.ch> inconspicuously tried to raise a crowd while walking across the back: *NixOS! NixOS! NixOS!*
[19:41:53] <afontain[m]> Maybe we can wait a bit before unleashing that :P
[19:42:13] <afontain[m]> you know, because people need to deal with prebuilt software most of the time
[19:44:24] <typedef[m]> afontain[m]: Possibly, I juste remember having a mint around
[19:44:42] <afontain[m]> that's possible too
[19:44:58] <afontain[m]> we nearly did propose it I think
[19:45:48] <afontain[m]> afontain[m]: you know, wait like 10 years after they started using linux
[19:46:08] * afontain[m] gave up on some custom-built eclipse with an integrated toolchain
[19:46:27] <afontain[m]> so I just used Ubuntu üôà
[19:46:58] <afontain[m]> steam-run-native didn't cut it
[20:30:19] <Anyone[m]> We could propose mint by default and for those who are not pleased we could propose other distros like Ubuntu, Pop_OS or Manjaro
[20:30:33] <Anyone[m]> Or Debian, Fedora, whatever 
[20:31:11] <sparrowhawk[m]> Pretty sure mint is a bad idea
[20:31:27] <sparrowhawk[m]> derived distributions are bad distros to start with, because getting help is split between upstream and the paintover
[20:31:32] <sparrowhawk[m]> s/paintover/paint over job/
[20:31:54] <sparrowhawk[m]> Just give Ubuntu in that case
[20:33:03] <Anyone[m]> I've never used Mint so I can't have a viable opinion 
[20:34:30] <Anyone[m]> I agree with giving Ubuntu because in the end I don't think starting on Linux gives you the pleasure to hate Flatpak
[20:35:08] <Anyone[m]> And those who don't like it could choose another distro and surely would be a bit more advanced 
[21:10:47] <artectrex[m]> What's good about Mint vs Ubuntu is the stance they take on snaps
[21:38:25] <Orbstheorem> I've heard really good things about Pop_OS from non power users.
[21:41:54] *** Joins: Skeetis[t][m] (~telegram2@2001:470:69fc:105::1:5f50)
[21:41:54] <Skeetis[t][m]> Orbstheorem: +1
[21:44:58] <LucasCrijns[m]> I would say that it might make more sense for new users to not choose a distribution, but to choose a desktop environment
[21:45:43] <LucasCrijns[m]> I really like gnome, but to the average Windows user it looks foreign and perhaps difficult. Then something like LxQt or KDE makes more sense
[21:48:08] <Orbstheorem> I like the idea of asking the user "how you want your system to look"?
[21:48:42] <LucasCrijns[m]> In the beginning, users don't care about the plumbing in the background. The look and daily usage is more important
[21:48:54] <LucasCrijns[m]> I guess having a 'software center' is a must
[21:50:26] <LucasCrijns[m]> In addition, driver support as well. So something like Ubuntu makes sense. I would like to propose fedora and their spins, but Nvidia drivers are still a bit more involved. Although, they now offer during the install to enable third-party repositories
[21:51:08] <Orbstheorem> LucasCrijns[m]: For some users, the plumbing is likely to become part of their daily lives.
[21:51:36] <Orbstheorem> It is worth asking "how comited are you to understanding how your system works"?
[21:51:49] <Orbstheorem> (Probably, after asking them what year they are in ü§£)
[21:52:26] <LucasCrijns[m]> That's a good aspect to mention indeed
[21:54:34] <typedef[m]> Looks like speed-distro-ing
[21:55:39] <afontain[m]> <LucasCrijns[m]> "I really like gnome, but to..." <- This is why I like Debian Cinnamon
[21:55:55] <afontain[m]> It has the compat of Debian, the "doesn't break" of Debian
[21:56:08] <afontain[m]> but it still looks okish
[21:56:14] <Orbstheorem> typedef[m]: For UI/UX yes, for the plumbing I don't think it's a good idea.
[21:56:29] <afontain[m]> and not too confusing to Windows users
[21:57:53] <Orbstheorem> afontain[m]: I think the advantage of Debian to most new users over the average stability of most user-oriented GNU/Linux distributions is no-longer worth the compromise.
[21:57:55] <Anyone[m]> afontain[m]: Yes, this is a must, and they would better off not having to use the command line too much at the beginning
[21:58:28] <Anyone[m]> * Yes, this is a must, and they would be better off not having to use the command line too much at the beginning
[21:58:31] <afontain[m]> my experience with Ubuntu is "it has bugs"
[21:58:50] <afontain[m]> I lasted about a year and a half
[21:59:24] <afontain[m]> if something isn't Mint or Ubuntu or Debian, I think folks can have a hard time with precompiled binaries and stuff like that
[21:59:45] <afontain[m]> which is to be fair, what half the people coming are looking for
[22:00:14] <Anyone[m]> I have to say, I installed Ubuntu to someone who is really not into computers, doesn't know a command line is, but it's been a couple of years now and I'm not receiving eny complaints
[22:00:17] <afontain[m]> ex: "moi j'ai r√©ussi √† rien faire pour le projet de robotique avec mon Windows parce que le type d'avant utilisait Linux"
[22:00:24] <afontain[m]> ^ I heard it in real life
[22:00:29] <Anyone[m]> * doesn't know what a  command
[22:00:40] <Anyone[m]> * I have to say, I installed Ubuntu to someone who is really not into computers, doesn't know what a  command line is, but it's been a couple of years now and I'm not receiving any complaints
[22:00:54] <Anyone[m]> afontain[m]: Yes
[22:01:20] <afontain[m]> I mean, otherwise, sure NixOS and Fedora are cool
[22:02:15] <afontain[m]> but like if I'm having trouble running that kind of software with NixOS, so will other users
[22:02:29] <afontain[m]> (NixOS is it's own thing though)
[22:02:35] <Anyone[m]> I guess we just need a compromise, where the interface and the services are handy enough but without giving up all the rest 
[22:03:17] <afontain[m]> s/it's/its/
[22:03:46] <afontain[m]> the biggest downside of Debian Stable is "software is old"
[22:04:22] <afontain[m]> but to be honest, I've been surprised how many people wanted Ubuntu LTS over the latest one because it's expected to be more stable*
[22:04:49] <afontain[m]> (*: except it's not bugfree, it just doesn't move much)
[22:05:03] <afontain[m]> (maybe that's not what people expected for stable)
