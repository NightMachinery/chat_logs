[01:30:22] <varrg> ThePhilgrim, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/replaceWith
[01:31:00] <matsaman> it could be that by 'html' you mean a variety of things, though
[01:31:01] <ThePhilgrim> instead of coding each html file statically, I'd like to have 1 html file with the background and the dashboard, and then depending on what tool the user chooses, the html of that tool is loaded in dynamically
[01:31:41] <junebug> You can edit the document and it's various elements
[01:31:52] <varrg> ThePhilgrim, I would have a <template> hold the tool, could enforce it quite a bit with shadowDOM, then inject it using replaceWith or similar

[04:34:52] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm used to using gulp for  my projects. Specifically I use it for concatenating/compressing js files, generating sourcemaps, running a server that updates the browser when I make changes... etc... But I keep getting told that gulp is old hat.
[04:35:45] <bobdobbs> Also I want to use *something* to include es6 modules from node libraries.
[04:36:37] <bobdobbs> It seems like the obvious choice for this is webpack. But honestly, webpack confuses the f** out of me. And every time I've trued to get it to work I hit the Wall Of Massive Complexity
[04:37:34] <bobdobbs> It's like trying to move from a horse-powered carriage that just works to the cockpit of a UFO made for aliens with two heads and 6 arms.
[04:38:31] <bobdobbs> So, other than webpack, what are the alternatives to gulp for preparing js/css?
[04:38:48] <bobdobbs> (and maybe things like React projects as well)

[06:10:04] <ljharb> !pass by value @ mknod
[06:10:04] <jellobot> mknod, JavaScript has call-by-value semantics in which references to objects are considered to be a type of value. Direct assignment to an argument will never be visible outside of a function. For a detailed explanation, see: https://web.archive.org/web/20161005155047/http://www.jon-carlos.com/2013/is-javascript-call-by-value-or-call-by-reference/
[06:11:46] <mknod> ljharb, why so?
[06:11:46] <leduyquang753> ljharb `[...foo]` is what popped up in MDN when I looked at Array's page.
[06:11:57] <leduyquang753> Was looking for a `copy` method.
[06:12:09] <ljharb> `.slice()` is that.

[06:12:21] <ljharb> mknod: because spread invokes the iterator protocol, which is slow, and unnecessary in this case.
[06:13:21] <mknod> I thought of .slice() but it looked a bit hacky.

[09:12:45] <ljharb> Decker: yes, every single thing in JS is always only passed by value
[09:12:50] <ljharb> !pass by value @ Decker
[09:12:50] <jellobot> Decker, JavaScript has call-by-value semantics in which references to objects are considered to be a type of value. Direct assignment to an argument will never be visible outside of a function. For a detailed explanation, see: https://web.archive.org/web/20161005155047/http://www.jon-carlos.com/2013/is-javascript-call-by-value-or-call-by-reference/
[09:13:00] <ljharb> unless you meant in C#, in which case i withdraw my comment
[09:13:07] <Decker> passed by pointer maybe unless it's a primitive like a number
[09:13:12] <ljharb> no, passed by value
[09:13:16] <Decker> which was the whole point.
[09:13:18] <ljharb> the value for an object happens to be *like* a pointer
[09:13:21] <ljharb> one you can't avoid dereferencing
[09:13:22] <gde35> ljharb: makes sense
[09:13:32] <ljharb> but "pass by reference" has a very objective and strict definition
[09:13:43] <Decker> so does pass by value
[09:13:51] <ljharb> which is why that's what JS has.
[09:14:01] <ljharb> pass by reference means you can *assign* to an argument inside the function, and it's visible from the caller
[09:14:05] <ljharb> not mutate, assign
[09:14:15] <ljharb> read the article i linked, it explains it quite correctly.

[09:15:15] <gde35> indeed
[09:15:17] <ljharb> gde35: assigning would be `x = something`, and having the caller see the something
[09:15:37] <gde35> I just wondered if it would continue to be an array

[11:39:33] <silly> !async
[11:39:33] <jellobot> silly, Promises are placeholders for values that'll be provided in the future. They allow composing asynchronous operations like synchronous ones. See http://robotlolita.me/2015/11/15/how-do-promises-work.html and https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/. Contrast with !cps & see https://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/. Another guide: http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/javascriptpromises.shtml
[11:39:35] <sheetjs> fs.readdir does not block the javascript event loop
[11:39:39] <sheetjs> neither does setTimeout
[11:39:52] <cornfeedhobo> ooof course
[11:39:58] <sheetjs> so in practice your code does something like
[11:40:09] <cornfeedhobo> yea i follow
[11:40:21] <sheetjs> you can use readdirSync to simplify
[11:40:36] <sheetjs> var foobar = fs.readdirSync('/path/to/dir')
[11:40:47] <sheetjs> the `err` parameter can be recovered if you put the thing in a try-catch block
[11:41:06] <cornfeedhobo> okay, brb. thanks!

[15:37:27] <trafficjam> jaawerth: right, with a traditional multi page app (which im used to building), a curl request to the app url would actually interact with the (backend) web framework, however if a next.js app loads data via an api, then curl wouldn't hit the api would it?
[15:37:42] <trafficjam> im saying you would need a headless browser or something to actually hit the api
[15:37:55] *** Joins: BaggersIO (~BaggersIO@62.96.248.182)
[15:39:44] <jaawerth> oh. well, nextjs is often used for static site generation or even simple isomorphic stuffs, so the fact that you're using nextjs isn't enough to say that on its own ;-)

[15:40:13] <jaawerth> if you're only using it as a single page app, it isn't so much going to do anything asynchronously as it will do nothing at all, since curl doesn't run client-side js. it'll just fetch your static pages and call it good
[15:42:07] <trafficjam> yeah that's what i'm saying, i'm used to http requests fetching the whole page but api-connected next apps don't work like that i have to remind myself

[20:49:42] <FlorianBad> I'm having some issues with Chrome because of some "push" requests I made. My page constantly has a pending request (for 30s) that takes care of the "push" request. Then it also has other requests (whatever the user does, like sending an object, getting one, etc). In some cases Chrome seems to timeout and I suspect it is because of the simultaneous
[20:49:42] <FlorianBad> pending "push" request. It might wait to reuse the same connection or something like this.
[20:50:27] <FlorianBad> Now, to do this I used XMLHttpRequest, and some people told me it was a bad idea. Could it fix the problem if I use the other alternative? (forgot what it was)
