[00:01:19] <novapy> Repiphany: Why not?
[00:01:23] <Repiphany> You can generate all of the factors of a number from the prime factors
[00:01:47] <novapy> ?
[00:01:47] <Repiphany> and even with a naive approach there, you only need to iterate up to sqrt(number_to_factor) in the worst case

[03:44:04] <chilversc> very_sneaky: though when I say run pip, I'm thinking more a system exec call, so the conan script is just acting like any other bash script or make file and chaining together external commands
[03:44:59] <chilversc> very_sneaky: by initialized correctly, if you use the venv api directly you have to call the correct functions, in the correct order, etc, which isn't quite as simple as a single "python -m venv foo" command

[04:52:40] <Shapeshifter> Hi. I need to generate some fairly complicated XML files. But actually, the variable part is sometimes quite small. So what I did for now was to just use string.Template and fill in the gaps in the XML. Of course, that's a bit hacky, and what's filled in the gaps will not be escaped or anything. So I'm thinking that I should rewrite this to actually generate the entire documents using something like
[04:52:46] <Shapeshifter> lxml. My question: does someone know a tool that would allow me to parse an existing XML into something like an 'edit script', i.e. Python code? As in, I would like to get a Python script that, if executed, would generate the given XML file. Then, I just have to edit the parts which are variable...
[04:53:16] <Shapeshifter> That would save me from reverse-engineering the entire XML tree manually.

[04:55:54] <Shapeshifter> Or alternatively, I guess I could just parse the XML into something like lxml's etree.XML and then modify it there. But then my question is how do I persist the 'template' etree.XML object? I guess I could just pickle it and ship it like that as a resource, but that seems weird.
[04:56:48] <SnoopJ> Would XSLT fit your problem? lxml supports it

[04:58:31] <Shapeshifter> SnoopJ: I guess it would work. Just not a big fan of XSLT ;) Maybe the easiest option I can think of is to just take the existing XML and replace the variable parts with some kind of default tag. Then, the procedure would simply be to parse the XML, modify the XML object to replace the defaults, then write out the result.

[06:45:17] <NeilRG> yeah, so I'm in this situation, and I'm leaning towards inheritance

[06:46:38] <SnoopJ> the "rule" is there is one worth paying mind to (the one given by the Gang of Four) is to *favor* composition over inheritance.
[06:46:40] <NeilRG> I have class A with certain behaviours, and I currently have class B that contains A, and only A.  B also exposes some members of A for convenience.  Whenever I inherit from A, say, A_prime, I have to wrap that in B(a: A_prime)

[14:09:45] <frat3rius> jinsun as this is nice it's somehow wrong as Protocol is not saying that this Mixin will implement this Protocol in the future it's rather saying it should implement it now and for example pyright throws errors about it
[14:10:53] <frat3rius> so is there some mechanism in type checkers that will declare some set of methods and attributes as to be declared in the future?

[16:24:10] <CrtxReavr> jinsun, I use cmd a lot more than powershell on windows. . . powershell is rediculously verbose. . .
[16:24:12] <exarkun> mickey8: maybe it's the same either way but I don't know for sure
[16:24:19] <mickey8> i dont think it's related to windows or powershell, because it's stdin/stdout?

[16:26:01] <CrtxReavr> Are you going to try to convince me that PowerShell is better than Python?
[16:26:03] <exarkun> mickey8: Still, a good step would be to look at the bytes or codepoints that you have on each side.  when you asked your question, a lot of REPLACEMENT CHARACTER showed up in your message, so I can't actually see what data you're dealing with (and maybe you can't either)

[16:28:35] <exarkun> mickey8: Well, let's just not assume anything, let's inspect and determine for sure.
[16:29:02] <exarkun> mickey8: Can you hook your Golang program up to a simpler program that just reads bytes from stdin and shows their repr()?
[16:29:20] <exarkun> mickey8: Then we can find out if your Python program is receiving the correct bytes or not
[16:29:37] <mickey8> exarkun so go sends in 240 159 167 150 (bytes) to stdin
[16:29:53] <mickey8> let me check the repr.
[16:30:06] <exarkun> mickey8: Okay.  That is the UTF-8 encoding of the emoji you pasted.
[16:30:19] <exarkun> But does the Python program _receive_ those bytes?
[16:30:44] <mickey8> print(repr(..)) is '"�\udc9f��"' (the " are expected, it's json encoded)
[16:30:56] <exarkun> mickey8: Note - that's not a bytes repr.
[16:31:07] <exarkun> A bytes repr looks like b'\xf0\x9f\xa7\x96'
[16:31:12] <mickey8> i'm sorry. how would i print the bytes repr?
[16:31:20] <exarkun> You have a str repr there, where str is Python's name for the unicode type
[16:31:35] <exarkun> You have a str because the API you used to read from stdin already decoded the bytes for you

[16:55:01] <exarkun> mickey8: Can you just write a tiny new Python program that reads from the Golang program and test it with that?  Instead of trying to jam this test into your existing Python program
[16:55:23] <exarkun> Semantic versioning is a lovely ideal.  Maybe someday someone will even implement it.
[16:55:40] <exarkun> most python packages fail to do so, though, even the ones that claim to
[16:56:26] <exarkun> mickey8: The idea of this is just to test transit of the data from Golang to Python and find out if the bug is at a level below your application code.

[17:01:29] <exarkun> mickey8: Separately, here's the deal with surrogates.  Unicode is made out of code points.  POSIX I/O APIs (and even Windows APIs to some extent) deal with bytes, not code points.  If you want to write a code point out, you encode it to bytes.  Windows generally prefers to do this using UTF-16 (though It Depends™).  UTF-16 is a 16 bit fixed-width encoding - every code point encodes to 16 bits.
[17:01:31] <exarkun> But there are more than 2 ** 16 unicode codepoints, so they don't all fit.  So instead there are these "surrogate" code points which come in pairs and let you use 32 bits to encode 1 code point.  But they only make sense together.  You can't split it into two 16 bit values and interpret them separately.  If you do, this is a "lone surrogate" and it is what Python was warning you about.
[17:01:32] <koopman> @jinsun: it’s a csv file I’m trying to replicate what it’s doing in an example
[17:02:55] <exarkun> mickey8: Ok.  `input()` is basically just reading from sys.stdin - but it is using the unicode reading layer.  sys.stdin.buffer.raw dives down past that layer to the bytes layer below it.  sys.stdin.buffer.raw.read() can just replace an input() call, mostly (except input() reads until end-of-line, sys.stdin.buffer.raw.read() reads until end-of-file... but if that matters, you can probably use
[17:02:56] <exarkun> sys.stdin.buffer.raw.readline() instead)

[17:17:40] <mickey8> exarkun i was just checking that after his comment. YES, when golang runs python, it has encoding cp1255, but when i run it "manually" it has utf-8
[17:17:51] <exarkun> mickey8: Cool.
[17:18:12] <mickey8> 1252*
[17:18:15] <exarkun> mickey8: So, Windows is lying to Python about the encoding of stdin - or Golang is using a Windows API for writing to stdout wrong.
[17:18:36] <exarkun> mickey8: So Golang always writes UTF-8 but sometimes Windows tells Python that it is sending it cp1252
[17:18:59] <exarkun> cp1252 is stupid and no one should ever use it, so I am inclined to not blame Golang for always using UTF-8 here...
[17:19:23] <mickey8> can we tell input() to use utf8 instead of cp1252? that should be the easier way around this
[17:19:29] <exarkun> You can, indeed.

[17:20:29] <jinsun> running python -X utf8 also makes it consistent https://bpa.st/W4CA
[17:20:57] <exarkun> The downside is that you've opted out of the system mechanism for configuring the encoding used for stdin - so if someone legitimately sends you data using a different encoding someday, the program will be broken because it will use utf-8 to decode it.
[17:21:22] <exarkun> But really everyone should just use utf-8 all the time so maybe it isn't much of a downside

[22:46:01] <LyndsySimon> There are a lot of things happening in the test running: the CI job is a docker-in-docker container. That container starts several docker instances, then executes the tests in one of those containers.
[22:46:25] <LyndsySimon> The tests themselves require access to the other containers - Postgres, localstack, redis, etc.
[22:46:44] <LyndsySimon> Of course, the test command itself is doing test collection before running them.
[22:47:43] <LyndsySimon> I'm looking for a way to figure out where the bottleneck is. I _believe_ it's that pytest itself is single-threaded because it's running in a CI job runner with only 1 vCPU, but I'm not sure that's the constraint here. How can I find out where the time is being spent?

[23:49:41] <pyhalo3> hey guys, can anyone help me out with some small issue? I have installed a package called linkchecker, which
[23:49:41] <pyhalo3>  crawls a given website url and returns all the link under the given parent url. The problem is, when I try to run the
[23:49:42] <pyhalo3>  most basic command I get syntax error of some sort. Tried to work through it for an hour but no luck so far.
[23:49:42] <pyhalo3> maybe I need to change the current console working directory in order to be able to run the command?
[23:49:43] <pyhalo3> for instance the command: "linkchecker http://www.example.com/" returns invalid syntax - But I entered it exactly
[23:49:43] <pyhalo3>  as shown in the instructions.
