[00:11:54] <nejimban> rex: usually, f is Lipschitz according to the second variable
[00:12:07] <nejimban> (under the assumptions of the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem)
[00:12:57] <johnkeats6> i've sort of given up on understanding the details of renormalizations and the actual computations for now, it's way too complicated and who's got time for that
[00:13:09] <johnkeats6> all i want is to just understand the damn definition of the standard model
[00:13:20] <johnkeats6> (already hard to do...)
[00:13:48] <rex> nejimban: Yeah but in this case the author seems to either forget to mention that (which is quite possibly considering previous homeworks :) ) or wanted to make a point of it :)
[00:14:02] <nejimban> I see :)

[00:19:54] <rex> Yeah I guess, so too; but there shouldn't be a need to guess :)
[00:20:21] <nejimban> I mean 'x' refers to the solution
[00:20:56] <johnkeats6> buster, i think i've become convinced the situation with qft is not as bad as mathematicians make it out to be. it does make a good amount of logical sense even if it's not perfectly rigorous
[00:21:04] <johnkeats6> but that might be the stockholm syndrome talking
[00:21:05] <rex> usually; but I get yelled at for making this kind of ambiguity :)
[00:22:10] <johnkeats6> and renormalization can be made rigorous by the way.

[03:02:22] <rex> well yeah, that might be true; but those equations are not equal for arbitrary a,b,c,x_1,x_2
[03:03:32] <coeus> nope which is why you have to find b and c in terms of a first
[03:04:49] <coeus> because a doesn't change
[03:04:55] <coeus> a is absolute

[03:06:29] <rex> why doesn't a change?

[03:07:25] <coeus> yes

[03:12:01] <coeus> so basically by plugging in your values into the one of the two original formulas, say x_1, then you get x_1 = (-(-a(x_1 + x_2))^2 - sqrt((-a(x_1+x_2))^2-4ac))/2a
[03:12:26] <rex> I still don't get where you got your weird formula from
[03:12:31] <coeus> whoops!
[03:12:51] <coeus> so basically by plugging in your values into the one of the two original formulas, say x_1, then you get x_1 = (-(-a(x_1 + x_2)) - sqrt((-a(x_1+x_2))^2-4ac))/2a
[03:14:00] <coeus> and that give you c in terms of a
[03:14:17] <coeus> okay okay
[03:14:24] <coeus> my formula
[03:16:15] <coeus> Area = (2/3)(x_2-x_1)(-b^2/4a +c), which is the area of a square using x_2 - x_1 and length and absolute min/max of the parabola as the height
[03:17:15] <coeus> because the absolute max/ min is found by taking the derivative of f, which is f' = 2a - b
[03:17:43] <coeus> sorry f' = 2ax - b
[03:18:39] <rex> what does that have to do with your original question?
[03:20:27] <coeus> since we can set f' = 0, which becomes 0 = 2ax - b, we can find x which becomes x = b/2a. We plug this back into our f and get the height
[03:20:52] <rex> what height?
[03:22:16] <coeus> f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c -> a(b/2a)^2 + b(b/2a) + c =
[03:23:26] <coeus> sorry x = -b/2a so f(x) = a(-b/2a)^2 + b(-b/2a) + c = -b^2/4a + c
[03:24:30] <coeus> 0 = 2x + b, sorry for confusing everyone
[03:24:38] <rex> why do you set x = - b/2a??? you wanted to know what the area between x = 5, x = 10, the curve of the parabola and the x-axis is

[07:41:02] <soulisson> cherim, yes, I understand. My question is more related to the terminology. I think it would be more appropriate to call that operation something else than an addition since I see it more like multiple additions
[07:41:14] *** Quits: tacegory (~tacegory@user/tacegory) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:42:19] <cherim> 123+102+57 is an expression (or a number, if you want), not an operation
[07:42:53] <cherim> f(a, b, c)=a+b+c is a function "sum of three arguments", but also not an operation
[07:43:19] <cherim> So it's not a really well-defined question
[07:43:43] <cherim> Addition is certainly a binary operation by the usual definition, not a ternary

[07:44:48] <cherim> But 123+102+57 in usual interpretation does not rely on defining any ternary operations, it's a shorthand for the left-asociative ((123 + 102) +57) involving two binary ones

[07:48:28] *** Quits: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[07:48:34] <soulisson> cherim, yes, I understand. Sorry about the question. I don't know how to be more explicit. It's related to the technique of addition in my country. Instead of doing (123 + 102) and then sum(123 + 102) + 57, we would calculate the sum in a single operation in adding the units, the tens, ...
[07:48:37] <Fangs> if you have some other context, that might be relevant to what you'd call it
[07:49:18] <soulisson> Fangs, yes, that's the context. We call the whole operation an addition but technically it's not correct, right?
[07:49:45] <Fangs> do you need to give it a technical name? for what purpose?
[07:50:00] <Fangs> "we would calculate the sum in a single operation in adding the units, the tens"
[07:50:46] <Fangs> I'm not going to be super pendatic with the parenthesis
[07:50:58] <Fangs> so do excuse me for being sloppy
[07:51:41] <soulisson> Fangs, I don't "need" to give it a technical name, I just find it a little bit odd to have called that way, it might confuse the kids
[07:51:47] <Fangs> that's more of the fact that you can write ((123 + 102) +57) as ((100+20+3)+(100+00+2)+(000+50+7)) = ... = (100 + 100 + 000) + (20 + 00 + 50) + (3 + 2 + 7)
[07:52:17] <cherim> Yes, at the level of "we would calculate the sum in a single operation in adding the units, the tens" it's not really about the formal meaning and going down to set-theoretic definitions
[07:52:50] <Fangs> soulisson: ah, so you're teaching kids and such. It might be worthwhile to think why we *can* be sloppy
[07:53:01] <Fangs> it boils down to associativity and commutativity of addition
[07:53:55] <Fangs> soulisson: but if you've defined addition to formally be "a binary operation" satisfying such and such condition, you might want to call them trippleaddition or something like that
[07:54:26] <Fangs> and show that it doesn't matter if you define tripple_add(x,y,z) as (x+y)+z or x+(y+z)
[07:54:57] <Fangs> (and this discussion is only meaningful if you can give an example of an operation thats not associative)
[07:57:16] <soulisson> Fangs, ok, thanks. I understand the concepts. I just don't want to teach false information. I think for now I don't have the choice and I have to stick with it, even the dictionary has this definition, lol
[07:57:52] <Fangs> soulisson: afaik there's no formal or colloquial definition for multiple addition
[07:58:25] <tusko> you probably just haven't gotten there yet
[07:58:27] <Fangs> soulisson: really I would just call them "repeated addition" for the first few times and tell them this is getting annoying, so I'll just call them addition

[10:40:39] <Fangs> loopspace: i remember an exercise we did, let's call i: K -> G. here's the exercise. if a SES splits at p, then you get a semidirect product. if it splits at i, you get a direct product
[10:40:48] <johnkeats6> Fangs, https://math.stackexchange.com/a/615161/9921
[10:40:53] <Fangs> so S_3 should again work here
[10:41:04] <Fangs> johnkeats6: is that a spoiler for my analysis problem
[10:41:11] <Fangs> fuck you, no!
[10:41:17] <Fangs> no spoilers
[10:41:30] <Fangs> some guy was berating me for not being able to do it, I'm still pissed about it
[10:42:35] <loopspace> Fangs: yeah any semidirect will do. 2.8 was similar question for modules (where you do get the desired q)
[10:43:16] <Fangs> loopspace: for modules just go ZG instead :D
[10:43:39] <Fangs> (I think this always works, but I dont remember why. probably some categorical hocus pocus)
[10:44:43] <loopspace> Modules are kind of a cool way of carrying an action around without having to provide it separately
[10:45:05] <Fangs> I suppose
[10:45:51] <loopspace> Extensions/group cohomology are giving me a new appreciation of modules
[10:45:52] <Fangs> johnkeats6: just tell me, is it obvious? from a scale of 0 - 10
[10:46:35] <Fangs> loopspace: group-valued group cohomology gives you cohomology operations too

[10:50:38] <johnkeats6> Fangs, to write it out in symbols takes some work, not totally obvious. the geometric picture is rather concise and elegant though
[10:51:16] <Fangs> johnkeats6: i've been drawing these  "/" and a "u"-ish thing underneath them all over my notebooks
[10:51:40] <Fangs> I remember doing this and having a geometric insight, but I'm just.. completely blind right now
[10:51:56] <Fangs> idk give me a week or so maybe I'll rave about it once I found the solution

[10:53:53] <rsonx> if the set is partitioned with equivalence classes then does this implies that the relation on that set is an equivalence relation?
[10:56:25] <johnkeats6> yes
[10:57:35] <rsonx> can i define np-complete set as an equivalence class having a relation "can be reduced to"
[10:58:43] <Fangs> "can be reduced to" is not symmetric right?
[10:59:59] <rsonx> so how do i define it.

[15:49:19] <rubiksdream> Fangs if X is a connected manifold, and S is a discrete set of points of X, such that X - S is simply connected, then so is X : X is path connected since it is locally path connected and X - S is path connected, then for any loop based at a point in X - S, it is homotopic to a constant loop in X - S, hence in X
[15:50:59] <rubiksdream> so this narrows it down a bit, if you want a branched cover f : X -> Y s.t. f : X - S -> Y - f(S) is a universal covering map, you need to start with a simply connected set

[18:10:58] <buster> is it just "... lies in some half plane through the origin"?
[18:11:17] <rubiksdream> but thats false, for instance you could have {i-0.1,i+0.1}, then that minimum is 1, but -1 does not lie on the convex hull of {i-0.1,i+0.1} Z-module
[18:11:20] <buster> or "half plane bounded by a hyperplane through the origin"

[18:27:57] <cherim> You have a polygon C in the plane and a point z outside
[18:27:59] <johnkeats6> rubiksdream, if a point is not in a convex set, there's a line separating them, and then it's clear there's a line through the point that doesn't go through the set

[18:28:22] <cherim> x1-z, ... x_k-z are vectors from z to the vertices
[18:28:58] <cherim> If you separated C from z by a line, all these vectors have nonnegative projections onto the line perpendicular to the separating one
[18:29:02] <rubiksdream> johnkeats6 yes, but im not sure how to show there is a line separating them
[18:29:05] <rubiksdream> that is what im trying to prove
[18:29:12] <johnkeats6> that's the separation theorem
[18:29:15] <rubiksdream> yes
[18:29:38] <rubiksdream> i can prove the separation theorem if this is true: Suppose for every line through the origin L, L intersects the convex hull of finitely many points {p_1,...,p_k}, then 0 is contained in the convex hull of {p_1,...,p_k}
[18:29:44] <rubiksdream> and then conclude as you and cherim are implying
[18:29:56] <cherim> Separation theorem has easy proof in general
[18:30:02] <johnkeats6> why don't you just look up the proof?
[18:30:05] <cherim> But in the case when one set is a point, it's trivial
[18:30:13] <rubiksdream> idk, i wanted to try it myself :/
[18:30:26] <johnkeats6> asking us how to do it is not trying it yourself :>
[18:30:36] <cherim> Take the point x of C closest to z and a perpendicular bisector to zx
[18:31:11] <cherim> Or something like this
[18:31:20] <johnkeats6> yeah.
[18:31:33] <johnkeats6> that works whenever there's a pair of points minimizing the distance between the two sets
[18:31:41] <johnkeats6> the general case is more annoying and involves trickery
[18:32:23] <cherim> General case has a very cute proof based on transfinite induction
[18:32:44] <cherim> You enlarge the sets keeping them convex and non-intersecting
[18:32:54] <Z-module> yeah, I was overlooking the case of {all the x_i} having just two points before, but that's easily dismissed first.
[18:33:34] <cherim> By taking an arbitrary unused point in the plane and joining it either to all points of set A or to all points of set B with segments
[18:33:44] <cherim> Final configuration fills all the plane
[18:34:32] <cherim> It is therefore necessarily two full halfplanes, except possibly the dividing line is partially in both sets
[18:34:42] <johnkeats6> why are they still disjoint?
[18:34:48] <johnkeats6> after you cone

[22:11:25] <Z-module> loopspace, maybe you haven't seen me say it before, but Hungerford's GTM has a somewhat silly exercise: "Find maps so that  0 -> Z_2 -> Z_4 -> Z_2 -> 0  is a non-split SES."  The silly part is that the maps making that an SES are unique, trivial to guess, and it doesn't split... the exercise is totally self-solving.
