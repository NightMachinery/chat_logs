[02:59:39] <videostruggler> I have some videos (mp4, aac, h264) which are not streamable in browser over http even after running them trough ffmpeg with the option "-movflags faststart". the first video works the second will completely download before playing (I'll gladly provide more info if I can) https://pastebin.com/raw/m9EcMbB3 (I'm trying to stream them in my home
[02:59:39] <videostruggler> network from a minio server) if this is not the right place for this question, any tips where to ask?
[03:00:19] <BtbN> Ever mp4 video is streamable via browser if the server supports range requests
[03:00:33] <BtbN> Is just needs to be a finished file, and not being written while trying to play it
[03:01:45] <BtbN> The first video, which you claim to be the working one, is 10bit HEVC. Browser don't support that. So you probably got the order wrong there.
[03:01:59] <videostruggler> ah sorry, so the first video I can skip trough the video for the second that just doesn't work
[03:01:59] <videostruggler> i uploaded them to the same server and they are both around 30 min
[03:02:08] <videostruggler> I''l check that with the hevec
[03:02:25] <videostruggler> thanks for the help so far get right back to you

[03:25:23] <videostruggler> is there something I'm missing or should try out
[03:25:24] <videostruggler> I'm currently using this for loop (has probably useless options), I don't need to get a small file just want to be able to stream it:
[03:25:24] <videostruggler> for i in *.mkv; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -vcodec h264 -acodec aac -preset slow -crf 23 -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" -pix_fmt  yuv420p -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -bufsize 1000k -b:a 128k -y -c:s mov_text -movflags +faststart -disposition:s:0 default  "out/${i%.*}.mp4"; done
[03:25:56] <BtbN> vcodec and acodec are deprecated. Use -c:v and -c:a.
[03:26:13] <BtbN> Also, baseline will looks like crap for no good reason, I'd just remove that limit and the level

[10:51:21] <SnarlesBarkley> I am not going to be able to be on for long, so I'll leave a brief description of my situation and contact info, should anyone see it later and want to help.
[10:51:38] <SnarlesBarkley> I have developed a Qt application which uses ffplay to show the user the video of a camera stream, using the QProcess class to start the player. In this application, there are a few sections; in the center, there is ffplay and the video feed, and on the left, there is a menu of sorts, which contains buttons which open submenus (QWidgets) into the
[10:51:39] <SnarlesBarkley> region occupied by ffplay. If I do nothing special regarding window order, any time I click a button in the menu area, that takes focus away from the ffplay window, causing it to minimize. This is not ideal. If I set the "-alwaysontop" parameter for ffplay to prevent the aforementioned behavior, my submenus will launch behind the ffplay window,
[10:51:39] <SnarlesBarkley> causing them to be inaccessible to the user. Thus, what I am hoping to find is some way, whether in Qt, ffplay, or Linux rhel 8, where it all lives, to keep ffplay not necessarily on top, but also never minimized either, if and when, it loses focus. Any help is great appreciated. If you have any ideas and would like to help, please email them to:
[10:51:40] <SnarlesBarkley> garbage.box1945@gmail.com (not TOTALLY a garbage box). Anyway, thanks in advance.  -Snarles.

[12:46:04] <ikonia> would someone be kind enough to sanity check my ffmpeg conversion command, I'm %99 sure it's correct, the command is to copy an mkv 264 file with true audio HD, to an mp4 container, leave the video stream untouched and convert the HD audio to ac3 with 640k bitrate
[12:46:39] <ikonia> ffmpeg -i test.mkv -acodec ac3 -b:a640k -c:v copy test.mp4
[12:48:47] <gnoo> ikonia: looks good
[12:49:17] <ikonia> thank you, I was %99 sure but the video copy options seem exessive, I wasn't sure I't been accurate enough to make sure the video is untouched

[14:32:58] <ikonia> well, as simple as that looked, I managed to screw it up
[14:33:59] <ikonia> the original showas  Matroska data when I copy the video to the mp4 container it changes the type to ISO Media, MP4 Base Media v1
[14:34:05] <ikonia> and apple TV won't play it
[14:34:20] <ikonia> so my copy command was wrong

[14:48:48] <another|> Apple is _very_ strict with brand/major/minor
[14:49:11] <galad> not really
[14:49:43] <galad> quicktime 7 maybe, but their rewritten media framework is not
[14:51:14] <ikonia> quicktime is happy with the video only file
[14:51:28] <another|> galad: Have not tried. maybe it got better
[14:51:43] <ikonia> so it must be the audio
[14:51:58] <galad> on which version of quicktime are you testing?
[14:52:12] <ikonia> 10.5
[14:53:34] <ikonia> one interesting thing (that doesn't seem to matter)
[14:54:21] <ikonia> handbrake enodes video that outputs as ISO Media, MP4 v2 [ISO 14496-14] the ffmpeg conversion outputs ISO Media, MP4 Base Media v1 [IS0 14496-12:2003]
[14:54:25] <ikonia> both seem to work,
[14:54:32] <ikonia> the audio appears to be the key
[14:55:06] <ikonia> I'll see if I've made a mistake trying to mirror the handbrake truehd settings for apple TV
[14:55:51] <JEEB> ikonia: that's just the ftyp basically. the identifiers at the very beginning of the file, and which you correctly noted don't seem to matter
[14:56:37] <JEEB> also FFmpeg does implement TrueHD in mp4 according to https://developer.dolby.com/globalassets/technology/dolby-truehd/dolby-truehd-mlp-bitstreams-within-the-iso-base-media-file-format.pdf
[14:56:47] <JEEB> you just need to do -strict experimental
[14:56:51] <ikonia> JEEB: appleTV can't playback truehd
[14:56:54] <JEEB> yup
[14:56:57] <JEEB> that side is usually the problem :P
[14:56:59] <ikonia> it needs to be moved to AC3 5.1
[14:57:01] <JEEB> my TV can't either
[14:57:25] <JEEB> or well, more specifically probably TrueHD in MP4 is the problem since nobody else really seems to have implemented it
[14:57:31] <JEEB> which is literally the only reason it's marked as experimental
[14:57:32] <JEEB> lol
[14:57:40] <JEEB> since nobody has been able to verify it against non-FFmpeg software
[14:59:15] <JEEB> apple tv specs say > Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through
[14:59:23] <JEEB> so I would guesstimate that you want some commonly used bit rate
[14:59:50] <galad> I just converted an audio track to ac3 with FFmpeg and it plays in QuickTIme
[14:59:58] <galad> no idea what's your actual issue is then
[15:00:18] <JEEB> also that does mean that it doesn't decode ac-3 by itself, so have you verified that whatever you have plugged your appletv into supports ac-3?
[15:00:28] <JEEB> https://support.apple.com/kb/SP648?locale=en_US
[15:01:00] <ikonia> JEEB: yeah, I've got a load of my videos encoded (using handbrake) that convert true HD audio into AC3 5.1
[15:01:14] <galad> it does decode ac-3 too, at least since the appletv 4
[15:01:25] <ikonia> the problem on this one was I screwed up encoding a small batch of videos so I'm now fixing them
[15:01:48] <ikonia> I could just -re-encode, but that seems overkill
[15:02:02] <ikonia> (more so when I've not got the source any more as I thougt I'd encoded everything I needed to)
[15:02:07] <JEEB> galad: yea the newer one seems to list it at least https://support.apple.com/kb/SP845?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US
[15:02:28] <JEEB> ikonia: well it sounds like you'll probably have to poke at the AC-3 at the very least :P
[15:02:35] <ikonia> JEEB: working on it now
[15:02:46] <ikonia> quite interesting learning for a novice like me too

[15:06:04] <JEEB> which is why if you ffprobe a blu-ray TrueHD stream you will see it being exposed as two separate AVStreams
[15:06:09] <JEEB> but both sharing a PID
[15:06:40] <JEEB> and hte TrueHD packets don't depend at all on the AC-3 ones
[15:06:50] <JEEB> it's just two completely separate streams being packet together in a PID
[15:06:57] <JEEB> *packed
[15:07:25] <another|> Ah, I believe I was thinking about atmos
[15:07:27] <JEEB> DTS did extensions with the XLL
[15:08:00] <JEEB> ATMOS is an extra stream with stuff in it, which technically should just be separate
[15:08:17] <JEEB> you can look up the ETSI spec if you want, something something object based
[15:08:34] <JEEB> https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103400_103499/103420/01.02.01_60/ts_103420v010201p.pdf
[15:08:37] <JEEB> there
[15:08:40] <JEEB> that should be the relevant spec for that stream
[15:11:04] <JEEB> "4.3 Decoding of object-based audio content" has a high-level explanation of the process
[15:14:46] <another|> Thanks, but I have some asm waiting for me ;)

[21:23:28] <JEEB> see the transcoding example for an example that utilizes the various libs and APIs, from which you can then pick and choose what is actually relevant for you
[21:23:45] <JEEB> also specifically for decoding and encoding here's some of the best doxy documentation we have https://lists.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__lavc__encdec.html
[21:24:11] <thiagomm> oh, thanks!
[21:24:52] <JEEB> the transcode example is in the git repo of course but also visible a la https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/master/doc/examples
[21:25:06] <JEEB> transcoding.c
[21:25:44] <JEEB> it does everything from reading and decoding and filtering to encoding and writing out into a file, so I recommend just looking at it and that doxy documentation with regards to the stuff you actually need
[21:25:58] <JEEB> the more limited examples might not be the best ones if you generally want to look into stuff
[21:26:10] <JEEB> since they specifically limit their API usage to some specific bit
[21:26:33] <JEEB> like the encoding example specifically just writing out mpeg1 video packets into a file as-is, which in 99% of all cases you don't want to do :P
[21:28:00] <thiagomm> yeah haha, I saw that. Thanks :D
