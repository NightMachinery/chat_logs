But, that doesn't guarantee any server-to-server links are encrypted, and of course the server(s) involved *do* have access to the data. But that's the only mode I know of. I could be wrong though.

[07:03:46] <csws> lol
[07:03:51] <csws> is it a transparent proxy or do they still use pac files?

[07:03:57] <catbeard> still an "Us" issue, just not a "you" issue
[07:03:57] <xe0n> transparent
[07:04:01] <csws> fancy
[07:04:19] <Gashido> technonerd, that´s wonderful test with millions of validations checks.
[07:04:24] <csws> we had a company demerging from us and their pac file would decide whether you were inside the corporate network by resolving sts.contoso.com
[07:04:30] <catbeard> also fuck  yeah https://letsdebug.net
[07:04:31] <csws> which worked super well until we migrated ADFS to azure lol
[07:05:00] <catbeard> helped me slash through an hour of troubleshooting to find a CAA record conflict on cloudflare that was preventing renewal
[07:05:11] <catbeard> of a letsencrypt cert
[07:05:31] <csws> the logic was something like "if ip = (old external IP) then return direct" so when we changed the IP all their clients suddenly tried to use an old http proxy that no longer worked
[07:05:43] <catbeard> weirdly enough it works behind cloudflare, so long as it doesn't redirect the .well-known/pki-validation/hash.txt request
[07:06:34] <catbeard> they were a bank so they needed full (strict) with CloudFlare CA signed certificate installed on the server
[07:07:06] <catbeard> but they don't wanna have to pay $200/month just to edge certificate their EV
[07:07:48] <technonerd> lol EV
[07:08:02] <technonerd> ITS GREEN OMG SECURE
[07:08:13] <catbeard> i mean it's still required, it doesn't do anything, but the D&B validation is pretty extensive
[07:08:35] <catbeard> that unlucky bastard that has to man the phones for the verification call tho
[07:08:42] <catbeard> hehe
[07:09:31] <catbeard> the named person must be the person to actually pick up the phone

[10:44:38] <csws> also hotlinks you to the nagios pages.. which the web UI doesn't
[10:44:56] <xe0n> neat, now write it in a webpage dashboard
[10:45:03] <xe0n> lol
[10:45:08] <csws> the web UI is a wallboard UI so it has shit loads of dead space and granny text too
[10:45:34] <csws> idk I like this method
[10:45:45] <csws> I hope one day someone will screen scrape my ghetto WPF app and make another integration
[10:45:56] <xe0n> but you need to install the app on each person's machine who wants to use, compared to browsing to a url?
[10:45:56] <csws> it'll just be a never ending pile of terrible integrations.. getting worse over time
[10:46:11] <csws> >imagining I packaged an installer
[10:46:33] <csws> I built it as a .net 5 app though so they have to install the .net 5 runtime, then they just double click the exe
[10:46:49] <xe0n> yup, they already got a browser too :P

[10:48:30] <Gashido> csws, .Net 5 runs really well on a Linux Webserver BTW
[10:49:26] <csws> yeah I ported my IRC bot to .net 5
[10:49:49] <csws> just had to fix some small issues (having backslashes in paths) and some bigger issues (depending on memory cache)
[10:50:18] <Gashido> Yeah. Dev on Windows to deploy on Linux can be funky at times.
[10:50:35] <csws> the MS tool for converting projects does some moronic stuff with packages
[10:50:47] <Gashido> I wonder is the Deploy function of Visual Studio alleviate some of those issues.
[10:51:03] <csws> I use jetbrains rider for this as it's a CLI app
[10:51:28] <csws> I looove rider

[11:42:19] <Cl0udNinja> so much overhead :(
[11:42:20] <DrZak> yay ssh tunnels
[11:42:37] <barred_owl> $cmd1 | ssh $host "cat > outputFile"
[11:42:44] <DrZak> it oculd be worse, you cold be still desinging websites in greamweaver
[11:43:02] <Cl0udNinja> barred_owl, oh yeah, I use that for putting my ssh key on systems
[11:43:04] <DrZak> it does solve a problem where you can't copy paste
[11:43:10] <barred_owl> Cl0udNinja, if you have a better idea, tell me
[11:43:12] <Cl0udNinja> but I dont use it for heavy lifting
[11:43:32] <Cl0udNinja> DrZak, how about we build a site with lycos sitebuilder? :)
[11:44:06] <barred_owl> Cl0udNinja, i am doing some time tests so that I can stream some files for work to another system without using space on mine
[11:44:18] <DrZak> that's for the people who run reactos
[11:44:47] <DrZak> or how is that NT4.0 clone called
[11:44:48] <Cl0udNinja> barred_owl, yeah there are *occasionally* use cases, but I wouldnt suggest using it for large files, or multiple files
[11:45:20] <barred_owl> Cl0udNinja, the overhead is worth the cost vs downtime from a file using all the drive space
[11:45:23] <DrZak> oh its easy - you open a windows share and copy files you need
[11:45:24] <DrZak> :)
[11:45:26] <Cl0udNinja> rsync/rsyncd is a better option, and I dont get why you're using your system as a proxy
[11:45:56] * Cl0udNinja throws DrZak into the asylum
[11:46:45] <crustacean> nobyk: Thanks, I really need this weekend
[11:47:16] <barred_owl> Cl0udNinja, do you have a command example?
[11:47:28] <DrZak> example of rsync?
[11:47:34] <DrZak> i hope you are kidding :D
[11:47:37] <Cl0udNinja> ^
[11:48:22] <Cl0udNinja> I'd suggest the rsyncd method instead of the rsync method that uses ssh, if you can
[11:48:50] <barred_owl> DrZak, stfu you arrogant fuck
[11:49:10] <DrZak> i am not arrogant, i am just patience challenged
[11:49:25] <nobyk> rsync /some/file username@host:/target/path
[11:49:39] <barred_owl> but that requires space on my drive
[11:49:40] <nobyk> if you use keys, that's possible too
[11:49:44] <Cl0udNinja> why
[11:49:48] <Cl0udNinja> go to the target system
[11:49:53] <Cl0udNinja> and rsync from there
[11:49:56] <nobyk> takes the one in your agent or you can add it to the rsync command
[11:49:57] <barred_owl> i am dealing with devs who wish to use space on my system's drive
[11:50:02] <DrZak> you ca push and pull
[11:50:05] <Cl0udNinja> I dont get why you're using your system as a proxy
[11:50:19] <barred_owl> Cl0udNinja to not have to stage files on my system
[11:50:24] <barred_owl> these devs are idiots
[11:50:28] <Cl0udNinja> ... again...
[11:50:33] <Cl0udNinja> ssh to the target host
[11:50:56] <Cl0udNinja> rsync -av --progress user@source:/path/to/data .
[11:51:05] <Church> Wait your personal system?
[11:51:07] <Church> Wat
[11:51:13] <Cl0udNinja> yeah idk wtf hes doin
[11:51:24] <DrZak> also, if you want to make things even more anonying, transfer virtual machines via scp
[11:51:28] <DrZak> that's always fun
[11:51:35] * Church shudders
[11:51:48] <DrZak> gets you the good old 90ies 57,6k modem feeling
[11:52:11] <nobyk> yeah ofcourse it works like any copy command where you <copy a-location b-location> and you can flip a and b
[11:52:35] <DrZak> just add utube '10 hour modem ambient sounds' and drink 3 espressos to enjoy every painful moment
[11:52:38] <Cl0udNinja> oh god... DrZak I just heard something today that made me shutter
[11:52:41] <barred_owl> example: gzip textFile | ssh $user@$host "cat > textFile.gz"
[11:53:05] <Cl0udNinja> I heard FB does a 'slow internet' day, to make them remember that not everyone has fast internet and make the developers work to minimize loading times
[11:53:13] <Cl0udNinja> I would *literally* murder the entire office
[11:53:31] <Cl0udNinja> barred_owl, omg dude.. use fucking rsync what the fuck
[11:53:42] <Cl0udNinja> dont use a hammer as a screwdriver
[11:53:48] <DrZak> considering how bloated fb is alredy, they dont really need to work that hard to get it slow
[11:54:03] <Cl0udNinja> no, like they slow the offices internet down
[11:54:12] <DrZak> oh, right
[11:54:37] <Cl0udNinja> so, you know, when you are trying to google for an answer 5 minutes before a meeting, you definitely wont feel rushed because google is taking 10 minutes to load
[11:54:44] <barred_owl> Cl0udNinja, the data is being created on the damn fly, not in fixed files
[11:55:00] <barred_owl> nevermind
[11:55:17] * Cl0udNinja shrugs, I tried to show you the way
[11:55:30] <DrZak> that's like when you search one of the support forums and it has this loading screen so you dot see anything

[16:01:58] <ender> a few years ago I was administering a fleet of Windows 8.1 tablets for a client. Users couldn't have admin rights, they didn't want to spend money for Windows Server or and MDM, and their parent's company network had no DHCP

[16:03:23] <Oliber> 'yes it is more secure because we can assign each device it's own IP' was probably their reasoning

[23:37:38] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Mhm, a friend of mine swapped over to work for FDNY a while back and it seemed like a weird move originally but it makes sense
[23:38:45] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> A little late in their career for a change like that but stability was something they were looking for and it makes sense considering the eventual pension benefits
[23:44:21] <sintax> I changed to IT 3 years ago
[23:44:35] <sintax> been enjoying it ever since. 
[23:44:50] <dragonfleas> i'm starting intermittent fasting and going to the gym today
[23:44:55] <dragonfleas> i'm nervous
[23:45:06] <sintax> just do you at the gym. 
[23:45:10] <sintax> everyone starts somewhere
[23:46:38] <dragonfleas> i think 30 minutes of cardio and then just go ham on the weights for an hour should be good
[23:46:47] <sintax> probably

[23:48:26] <dragonfleas> i'm on a 24 hour fast as of an hour ago
[23:48:36] <dragonfleas> this is going to be fucking hard lol
[23:49:17] <sintax> yeah. i had a muslim dude that worked for me. when he fasted good lord he turned in to an ass. awesome dude. i just learned to steer clear of him when fasting haha
[23:52:06] <PublicWiFi> dragonfleas: it gets easier once you get past that first hunger pain
[23:52:18] <dragonfleas> do you fast wifi?
[23:52:23] <PublicWiFi> yeah i used to 
[23:52:30] <dragonfleas> i heard it can be like magic for weight loss
[23:52:34] <PublicWiFi> never did past 2.5 days lol
[23:52:40] <dragonfleas> oh i'm going to stop go
[23:52:46] <dragonfleas> so two 24 hour fasts every week
[23:52:55] <dragonfleas> but in between that time eat whatever the fuck i want
[23:52:55] <PublicWiFi> yeah a lb of fat is roughly 3500 cal
[23:53:34] <PublicWiFi> so whatever you TDEE is will be that much toward weightloss
[23:53:46] <PublicWiFi> so roughly 2000-2500 for 1 day, almost 1lb of weight loss 
[23:53:52] <dragonfleas> what the fuck
[23:53:54] <dragonfleas> that's like hacking irl
[23:54:13] <dragonfleas> so that means
[23:54:44] <dragonfleas> i can look at like 70 pounds of true fat loss in a year?
[23:54:47] <dragonfleas> there's no way
[23:54:57] <PublicWiFi> its all a big equation
[23:55:00] <dragonfleas> well i'd be unhealthy at that rate
[23:55:01] <PublicWiFi> input output
[23:55:21] <PublicWiFi> yeah most places advise 1 lb per week is a pretty healthy rate (for someone who isn't very large)
[23:55:43] <PublicWiFi> like 1lb per week max I mean
[23:56:12] <PublicWiFi> i personally find it easier to just suffer and fast a few times than count calories 
[23:56:16] <PublicWiFi> but im a person of extremes lol
[23:56:24] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> My friend still does IT, just for FDNY for significantly less than market pay I think
[23:56:39] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> But it doesn't have the stress of the financial industry and has pension
[23:57:11] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> I'm dabbling with taking a job as a database analyst and just abandoning the burning tire fire that is devops
[23:57:30] <PublicWiFi> dragonfleas: if you try to fast more than 1 day make sure you take your salt and potassium and stuff

[23:58:37] <PublicWiFi> well dont go over TDEE or youll be nullifying some of your fast losses lol
[23:59:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> devops eh
[23:59:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm focusing more on M365 work than anything else these days
