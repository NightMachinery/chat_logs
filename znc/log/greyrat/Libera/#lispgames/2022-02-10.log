[19:57:43] <artchad> good evening fellow lisp game devlopers. I hope your game project is going forward.
[19:58:29] <crumpo> How is yours going, artchad?
[19:58:58] <artchad> crumo. ehehehehe
[19:59:09] <artchad> well... it's going something something
[19:59:13] <crumpo> :)
[19:59:32] <artchad> I'm right now drawing, so that indirectly will influence my game
[20:00:19] <artchad> I think the lispgames community needs more tutorials.
[20:00:55] *** Joins: aeth_ (~aeth@user/aeth)
[20:01:14] <artchad> Or maybe don't. I like how people in the lisp community at least know the language. I might be one of the less experienced devs, but still I'm not a moron. That should count for something.
[20:01:37] <crumpo> tbh I don't know the language very well yet
[20:01:43] <artchad> There is a kind of filtering process that people go through. At the end only the purest of the pure end up with common lisp.
[20:01:59] <crumpo> But I think a lot of tutorials relate to something on the other side of language bindings - like for SDL, OpenGL, etc.
[20:02:18] <crumpo> Haha, maybe that's the problem, I'm not using CL :(
[20:02:21] <artchad> cumpo, I don't know wether I would consider myself someone who knows the language well. I know how to get things done. I don't feel like I'm missing anything major.
[20:02:41] *** Quits: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth) (Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by aeth_)))
[20:02:46] *** aeth_ is now known as aeth
[20:02:49] <artchad> I will make tutorials on SDL and OpenGL, once I'm more familiar with it. I promise!
[20:03:07] <artchad> There is a lot of room for improvement in this area.
[20:03:38] <crumpo> I'm very familiar with SDL, and reasonably familiar with (modern) OpenGL; but I'm learning lisp as part of a mixed scheme/C++ project so I'm only really scratching the surface so far
[20:04:50] <artchad> I'm a noob in SDL and OpenGL, but proficient in CL, so that's the other side of the coin.
[20:06:20] <lambdart> artchad: at the end the purest understand that language or code does not matter
[20:07:44] <lambdart> programming languages are just tools to transform data nothing more
[20:07:45] <artchad> lambdart: In practice it does though. The question is wether you want to live in the world of the intellect or the material plane.
[20:08:18] <artchad> Lisp makes me very productive. I don't know wether I'd ever finished a game project, if it wasn't written in Lisp.
[20:10:42] <lambdart> yes, eval bruteforce I guess :/
[20:11:16] <lambdart> M-x next-track RET
[20:12:06] <lambdart> #3 Big Lies: Sotfware is a platform, code should be designed around your mental model of the world, code is more important then data!
[20:17:03] <artchad> the second is truth though. It just depends on the use case. I think it's extremely beneficial be able to write the code the way you think.
[20:18:01] <lambdart> inefficient code for sure
[20:19:15] <lambdart> code should be designed around the data 
[20:19:29] <artchad> we have gigahertz CPUs. Also compilers can always be written to optimize the shit out of the higher level abstractions.
[20:19:50] <artchad> that's how I view it. The compiler has to do the heavy lifting.
[20:20:10] <artchad> but the user of the language shouldn't feel impaired in any way.
[20:20:17] <lambdart> yes flip our magic wand in the air to solve the problem for you
[20:20:24] <lambdart> very realistic 
[20:20:36] <lambdart> your*
[20:21:37] <artchad> it seems to work right now.
[20:22:06] <artchad> everything is possible with a bit of magic and a strong faith
[20:24:35] <lambdart> delusional dreams of every computer science stunted 
[20:27:25] <artchad> I guess you meant to write "student". I will see for myself. I haven't run into issues yet. But I'm not doing anything majorly difficult though.
[20:28:40] <lambdart> You will remember this conversation for sure...
[20:29:45] <lambdart> student*
[20:30:03] <artchad> Could be. But as with everything, one has to experience it oneself before one understands. People also told me math was hard. It turned out to not be. People said many things weren't possible, and they turned out to be possible.
[20:31:21] <lambdart> I'm not saying is impossible to write shit code that 'works'...
[20:31:57] <lambdart> specially in lisp
[20:32:36] <artchad> I didn't imply such a thing. I'm talking about good code that works. Code that is reasonably fast.
[20:32:59] <artchad> reasonably fast for what it does and for the amount of time invested and for the use case.
[20:33:35] <lambdart> if math is not hard why are so many conjectures without profs?
[20:34:15] <lambdart> solve P=NP (or different) and please get your prise (1M of dollars)!
[20:36:06] <artchad> Sure, if you are trying to answer major questions like P=NP or P!=NP, that's a different story. I'm talking about things like calculus, linear algebra, and other fields with a lot of great learning material.
[20:36:33] <lambdart> so what? 'Any idiot can count to 1'
[20:38:04] * lambdart thank you Bob Widlar for the wisdom  
[20:38:11] <artchad> lambard: You seem to me like a big ol' grumpy man who's just trying to grumpy around. I'm not into being grumpy. So...let me say that I like Lisp a lot and I will keep in mind what you said. :)
[20:38:20] <artchad> *lambdart
[20:38:33] <artchad> that name is interesting :D
