[21:43:39] <alchemist> rawktucc: I ordered from JP without a hassle tbh, went through customs real smooth like
[21:43:41] <rawktucc> those old LTO drives are all used/old new stock though
[21:43:56] <rawktucc> alchemist, direct from JP to your country? Amazon JP doesn't let you order that way, idk anywhere else that has them from Japan direct
[21:44:02] <rawktucc> oh and that's for the 5/10 packs
[21:44:06] <rawktucc> this is a 25 spindle :D
[21:44:15] <rawktucc> with inkjet printable label but idc about that
[21:44:40] <alchemist> eBay, I directly bought from a japanese seller. Spindles I dont trust to survive the shipping
[21:45:00] <rawktucc> oh ebay is fine. thought you bought direct from a storefront or JP website
[21:45:04] <alchemist> I always bought them in a jewelcase as a bundle of 10-20 pcs each time. 
[21:45:06] <rawktucc> spindle won't survive? you mean the discs?
[21:45:14] <alchemist> rawktucc: ah naw, thats too much hassle, you are right.
[21:45:31] <alchemist> Yes as the discs on the spindle shattering, had that happen with DVDs once I bought online. 
[21:45:32] <rawktucc> all the ebay listings for these discs in jewelcases are so expensive
[21:45:45] <rawktucc> if they shattered couldn't I just request a refund from the ebay seller?

[21:46:13] <alchemist> Yes you could, but in the end idk if I would trust the structural integrety of the spindle. Maybe I am paranoid :(.
[21:46:49] <rawktucc> it's good to be paranoid with this stuff but personally I imagine if there's a shattered disc or physical disc damage, I would notice it and report it to the seller

[21:47:54] <rawktucc> yeah really nothing beyond that one overpriced 10 pack which, for two, is 280$ ish, which is more than the 25 for 250
[21:47:59] <rawktucc> not much more I guess but... idk
[21:49:41] <rawktucc> I think it's like at least 3-5TB that I have that I don't want to lose...
[21:49:44] *** Quits: grumb (~grumb@rint.osaka) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[21:49:52] <rawktucc> about a TB per pack, ish...
[21:49:53] *** Joins: grumb (~grumb@rint.osaka)
[21:49:58] <rawktucc> about $500-600 for true cold storage
[21:50:19] <rawktucc> also I wrestle with the idea like... should I encrypt the data before storage?? what if I lose or forget the key? And it is kinda sensitive private data

[21:52:22] <alchemist> Well the question I would ask is, which tool should I use for encrypting (especially alot of files) and how to do it in a manner that even if I loose some files due to bitrot I can still recover the rest.
[21:52:50] <alchemist> Thats why I keep everything unpacked and raw and have different copies personally..
[21:54:47] <rawktucc> for encrypting, you could use rclone crypt with a local backend. alternatively, veracrypt; pgp/gpg
[21:55:01] <rawktucc> and generate par2 recovery files for both the unencrypted, and encrypted data
[21:55:21] <rawktucc> that helps against bitrot in most cases. the blurays are far more resilient than previous disc formats too
[21:55:34] <rawktucc> oh and finally, have another copy somewhere else :)

[21:58:06] <rawktucc> i wonder how much it would cost to store the par2 recovery files in cloud storage somewhere

[23:55:17] <rawktucc> sort of, depends on how much percent you generate
