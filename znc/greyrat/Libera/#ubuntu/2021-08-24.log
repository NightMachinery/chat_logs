[01:01:21] <friendlyguy> sda has three partitions: sda1=boot, sda2=swap, sda3=root
[01:01:30] <friendlyguy> i booted a live cd and mounted sda3 to /mnt, sda1 to /mnt/boot
[01:01:45] <friendlyguy> i then mounted /proc /dev as well as sys with the bind option to /mnt/proc etc
[01:02:05] <friendlyguy> chrooted into /mnt
[01:02:21] <friendlyguy> now when i try to run grub-install --recheck i get: Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.
[01:02:30] <friendlyguy> the exact command i run is "grub-install --recheck /dev/sda"
[01:02:40] <friendlyguy> i ran out of ideas what to try, any ideas pretty please? :)
[01:02:49] <friendlyguy> btw: thats grub 0.97
[01:03:17] <tomreyn> friendlyguy: why not just back it up and do a non stone age install?
