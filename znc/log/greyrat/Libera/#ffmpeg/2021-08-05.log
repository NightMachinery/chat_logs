[07:47:41] <neil11> hi everyone,  I am a newbie for ffmpeg, I am implementing a function based on ffmpeg to capture image from webcamera.
[07:48:44] <neil11> ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="Webcam C170" -frames 1 target.jpg is the cmd which I plan to use, it works in cmd line, but when I invoke it from subprocess.call of python, it always failed with error: Camera IO Error
[07:49:26] <neil11> anyone who know how to resolve this? thanks  in advance if someone can provide support to me
[07:49:48] <AaronBurr> windows? linux? mac?
[07:49:51] <AMM> Check the actual subprocess call
[07:49:56] <neil11> yes, Windows
[07:49:57] <AMM> dshow is windows
[07:50:34] <AMM> It's very likely you're messing up the cmd list
[07:52:03] <neil11> I also check with the cmd list, someone said that the quote might cause this issue. but I found it is not caused by quote
[07:54:06] <neil11> cmd = ['ffmpeg', '-f', 'dshow', '-i', 'video=Webcam C170', '-frames', '1', "target2.jpg"] will met the Camera IO Error, I suspect this is something related with ffmpeg. since the cmd = ['ffmpeg', '-f', 'dshow', '-list_options', 'true', '-i', 'video=Webcam C170'] is working well in cmd line and subprocess call
[07:55:31] <neil11> but cmd list as ['ffmpeg', '-f', 'dshow', '-i', 'video=Webcam C170', '-frames', '1', "target2.jpg"] failed with error as following:
[07:55:34] <neil11> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/2bee5a394aef3f4c11e24eef93cd46fe/pasted.txt

[07:56:26] <neil11> ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="Webcam C170" -frames 1 target.jpg
[07:57:59] <neil11> cmd as above is from ms dos, it works well also when I execute the cmd from cmd command line. if I put these commands in a dos bat script, and double click the script bat file. will met the same Error as python subprocess call method
[07:59:11] <neil11> AMM, could you please help to check the cmd I execute from python subprocess, if any parameter is missed?

[13:59:00] <Tim62> Hi everyone! I have a question regarding ffmpeg frame export. I have a ProRes 4444XQ file. When I load the clip into Davinci resolve, I am able to recover the highlight areas.
[13:59:00] <Tim62> But when I export a TIFF frame via ffmpeg (I tried different quality settings) the highlights are clipped and I'm unable to recover them.
[13:59:06] *** Quits: PrenzlBurg (~PrenzlBur@145.243.166.71) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:59:21] <Tim62> Do you have any idea, how I am able to extract a TIFF without losing any values - especially in the highlights?
[13:59:52] *** Joins: darkapex (~darkapex@user/darkapex)
[14:00:10] <AaronBurr> is your source material 10-bit depth?
[14:00:20] <Tim62> 12 bit
[14:00:27] <JEEB> please post your command line and terminal output with `-v verbose` onto a pastebin of your choice
[14:00:30] <JEEB> and link here
[14:00:35] <JEEB> so we can see how it's progressing atm
[14:03:18] <Tim62> ok, thanks. give me a minute - I'll send the link
[14:04:55] <JEEB> the verbose verbosity level does add stuff like the links of the (sometimes implicit) filters as well, so it's generally a bit more helpful in seeing what's happening
[14:05:46] <Tim62> https://pastebin.com/PVHwJtwG here we go :)
[14:06:01] <JEEB> cheers
[14:06:25] *** Joins: Blacker47 (~Blacker47@user/blacker47)
[14:07:09] <JEEB> so yes, input is limited signal level (shown as "tv"), it only has bt709 primaries configured (other values at "unknown") and it's not interlaced but progressive
[14:07:35] <JEEB> so in that sense if those values for interpretation are correct, there shouldn't be anything special there in the input
[14:08:39] <furq> tiff only supports 8-bit yuv
[14:08:52] <JEEB> then for tiff there is an RGB conversion there
[14:09:04] <JEEB> > [auto_scaler_0 @ 0000023abf2a6800] w:3840 h:2160 fmt:yuv444p12le sar:1/1 -> w:3840 h:2160 fmt:rgb24 sar:1/1 flags:0x4
[14:09:18] <JEEB> furq: seems to be 8bit RGB just fine
[14:09:28] <furq> i mean not 12-bit
[14:09:48] <furq> it does support rgb48le which would probably be a better auto choice
[14:10:40] <JEEB> I would probably recommend testing out zscale to convert to a higher bit depth RGB (since the build has zimg enabled, which enables the zscale filter)
[14:11:09] <JEEB> needs to be packed for tiff, so a separate scale filter to pack it is needed, but otherwise should be OK
[14:11:21] <JEEB> if the input is interpreted correctly
[14:11:26] <furq> oh wait you're specifying rgb24
[14:12:18] <furq> just -pix_fmt rgb48le should give better results although zscale may do even better
[14:12:58] <Tim62> ok, thank you JEEB and furq. I'll try with zscale :)
[14:15:22] <Tim62> is this the correct flag: "-vf zscale=transfer=linear" ?

[19:56:08] <Josef> Hey, my colleague Tim was asking earlier today similar question, but since we couldn't find the right solution... Maybe you can help us with our problem
[19:56:27] <Josef> I want to extract a frame from a ProRes Clip, recorded with a Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 4.6K Gen 2 camera with ffmpeg. I noticed the following: When I import the ProRes Clip into Davinci I can recover some highlights, which are out of the displayed range by lowering the gain paramater. As you can see in the waveform the thrid peak has information in
[19:56:27] <Josef> all channels.
[19:56:28] <Josef> After I extracted the frame with ffmpeg, I couldn't recover the highlights anymore. Waveform: Values are clipped till the fifth peak.
[19:56:28] <Josef> I used the following command: ffmpeg  -ss 00:00:01 -i 0volt.mov -vf zscale=t=input,zscale=c=input -frames:v 1  TIFFs\0volt.tiff -v verbose
[19:56:29] <Josef> Here is the output of the ffmpeg command line: https://pastebin.com/a36ML3tL
[19:56:29] <Josef> Do you have any hint, how the original quality and dynanmic range by extracting a TIFF-Frame with ffmpeg can be retained?
[19:56:30] <Josef> Thank you!
[19:57:21] <Josef> Waveform of ProRes Clip: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKl9j.png
[19:57:44] <Josef> Waveform of FFMPEG converted TIFF: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mCo3u.png
[19:59:12] <kepstin> it's converting from limited-range video (which is standard) to full-range rgb (which is expected in image formats). As a result, any signal that was out of range is clipped.
[19:59:37] <AaronBurr> can tiff do 36bit RGB?
[19:59:55] <kepstin> it's doing 16 bit per channel rgb fine, that's not the issue
[20:01:24] <Josef> How can I normalize the video level for my image?
[20:01:29] <kepstin> fwiw, the "out of range" stuff isn't *really* supposed to be image content, but rather just overhead for filter overshoots and stuff. you should be shooting video so all the dynamic range you want to use is in valid levels
[20:02:26] <kepstin> that said, you should be able to set ffmpeg scaler options to request that it output the rgb in limited range mode
[20:02:36] <kepstin> this might require using the scale filter manually to set options
[20:04:04] <Josef> We need the overhead in order to evaluate the true dynamic range. Just for science purposes
[20:05:33] <kepstin> btw, your 'zscale' filter isn't doing anything there as far as i can tell? all the conversion is being done by an auto-inserted ffmpeg scale filter.
[20:07:15] <Josef> yes, you might be right
[20:07:24] <Josef> OK, so I can try the scaler options, but it's not clear to me which options prevent the clipping
[20:08:00] <Josef> src_range and dst_range ?
[20:10:22] *** Quits: beaver (~beaver@user/pong) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:10:26] <kepstin> should just need to set dst_range=0 to output as limited range
[20:10:35] <kepstin> (the src_range is already correct)
[20:11:07] <Josef> ok great, I'll try this
[20:12:13] <kepstin> i think you can just do "-vf scale=dst_range=0" and it'll pick up the output format requirements automatically and use your scale filter instead of auto-inserting one.

Internets suggest to use `-sseof -5`, but it then instead cuts away 'left' part of the video, leaving just last 5 sec as the output.
