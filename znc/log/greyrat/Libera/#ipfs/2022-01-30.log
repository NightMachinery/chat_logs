[09:26:44] <immibis> what protection does IPFS have from malicious nodes? For example, a node that silently drops items from its hashtable (Kademlia?), a node that claims to have content but never actually sends it, or a node that performs slowloris on its clients

[12:47:27] <reasv> >a node that silently drops items from its hashtable (Kademlia?), a node that claims to have content but never actually sends it,
[12:47:27] <reasv> Are these not the same though?
[12:49:20] <reasv> Well it can happen. I don't think IPFS could do anything about it. If the node doesn't deliver content, it just doesn't. You wouldn't get it and IPFS would give up.
[12:49:20] <reasv> IPFS doesn't guarantee anyone has anything, it just gives you a way to find content that is stored and made available. IPFS does guarantee the content, if you receive it, is what you want.
[12:49:20] <reasv> Even if the nodes weren't malicious, they could delete content in between you asking for it and the DHT knowing it's gone. So it's never a guarantee
[13:59:57] <immibis> As I understand distributed hashtables, nodes hold hashtable entries referring to content held by OTHER nodes (and sometimes themselves)
