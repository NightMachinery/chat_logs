[00:05:24] <Zipheir> Yeah, sytse sort of disappeared.
[00:11:39] <siiky> :/  now that I wanted to divagate about abstract math with someone
[00:11:45] <siiky> hope they're alright
[00:24:51] <mario-goulart> siiky: my wife is a psychologist.  Maybe she can help you.
[00:36:11] <siiky> didn't know psychologists learn abstract math!
[00:36:54] <mario-goulart> :-D
[00:37:40] <siiky> that would be pretty funny lol "what brings you here today?"  "I might have an obsessive disorder; I can't get these groups and rings out of my head"
[00:38:20] <crumpo> Rings are better left in, imo
[00:39:12] <crumpo> Was it ring theory you wanted to talk about?
[00:39:16] <Zipheir> Hmm, complex analysis complex.
[00:40:21] <jcowan> Sounds like you need group therapy.
[00:40:52] <siiky> yes, bring all the bad jokes, let's make a ring!
[00:41:08] <wasamasa> not my field of expertise
[00:41:22] <siiky> jesus
[00:41:33] <siiky> (that was a good one, so you're out)
[00:41:43] <Zipheir> siiky: What's the neutral bad joke, though?
[00:41:43] <siiky> you're not congruent with the rest
[00:42:27] <wasamasa> wow: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_joke
[00:43:54] <Zipheir> A friend of mine had the "don't drink and derive" one on a t-shirt in colleg.
[00:43:58] <Zipheir> *college
[00:44:21] <Zipheir> It was unfortunately apropos to his lifestyle.
[00:45:41] <Zipheir> "Bluto Blutarsky, but an astrophysics major" would be a good quick summary of this person at that time.
[00:46:10] <siiky> crumpo: about modular groups and permutations (symmetric groups)
[00:46:44] <crumpo> Aww. I'm a big fan of ring theory but my group theory is quite poor
[00:47:22] <Zipheir> I'm reading Pinter's book now and just started on ring theory.  Interesting stuff, though tons of axioms to establish.
[00:47:37] <crumpo> Yeah :D
[00:47:48] <siiky> if you understand rings you understand groups! :D
[00:48:48] <siiky> but I'm rusty af... I don't even know names anymore
[00:49:44] <Zipheir> siiky: Any books you're particularly fond of?
[00:49:49] <Zipheir> Math books, presumably.
[00:51:24] <siiky> I don't actually read math books... I have some, but never read them
[00:51:44] <siiky> only as part of university
[00:51:47] <Zipheir> I find Aluffi's book very deep and interesting, if rather eccentric.
[00:51:57] <Zipheir> Ah, ok.
[00:51:58] <siiky> they're usually so dry, I can't pull myself through them
[00:52:29] <siiky> if you have suggestions to make me change my mind, fire away
[00:53:59] <Zipheir> I think I know what you mean.  Mathematical writing tends to go by different rules of "good writing" than does the rest of the universe.
[00:54:02] <crumpo> On Numbers and Games is pretty readable
[00:54:46] <Zipheir> Charles Pinter, A Book of Abstract Algebra.  Although it's pretty basic, it's actually well-written!  (From a writer's point of view)
[00:55:29] <Zipheir> And yeah, Aluffi's Algebra Chapter 0, though get ready for some You Are Expected To Understand This, It Is Obvious.
[00:56:15] <Zipheir> crumpo: Yeah, that's on my list. :)
[00:56:25] <crumpo> :)
[00:59:06] <siiky> Zipheir: yeah, the books we used in university were almost like a reference, but that's understandable because we're supposed to follow it during class
[00:59:44] <siiky> but I once started reading smth smth Knapp(?) (because free), and dam... can't do it
[01:00:00] <siiky> maybe that one is supposed to be followed on a class too, idk
[01:00:09] <Zipheir> Yeah.
[01:00:53] <siiky> https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~aknapp/download.html  one of these ones, probably the "Basic Algebra" one
[01:01:06] <Zipheir> There are good books that suffer from that, too, like Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right.  I think it's really elegant, but he never really gives you a reason to care about what you're reading beyond "this is a very important result".
[01:01:33] <Zipheir> Oh, stonybrook.edu.
[01:01:38] <siiky> I'll add those you two mentioned to my list, thanks!
[01:02:41] <Zipheir> Oh yeah, that's quite dry.
[01:03:09] <siiky> that's another thing... the reason I like math in primary school and a bit through middle school was that things had a reason and were useful (the problems were even framed as Real World Problems); but after that math teachers just go into it expecting you to care and see why it _might_ be useful
[01:03:51] <siiky> I hated high-school math (fuck trigonometry)
[01:03:54] <Zipheir> Hah.
[01:04:11] <Zipheir> "How many obscure identities can *you* remember?"
[01:04:40] <Zipheir> This is another very fun book https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf
[01:04:40] <siiky> (this is part of the reason why I'm rusty with group/ring theory; I don't use it in practice past a very easy level)
[01:07:44] <crumpo> The main reason I remember for ring theory was... more ring theory
[01:07:46] <crumpo> But I loved it
[01:12:31] <siiky> yeah, after you get to enjoy and understand a bit, it's easier to get more into it
[01:15:07] <siiky> in university things were framed The Right Way (imo); we learned some modular arithmetic without knowing why, but then we learned it was used for cryptography, learned a bit of cryptography, and then it was easier to get into groups & rings. similary with abstract algebra and category theory
[01:16:44] <crumpo> That's cool. We did things in a similar order, though without any cryptography. The utility of things was often just not stated
[01:17:19] <crumpo> I don't think I cared at that point, but when things got even more abstract later on, I lost interest
[01:19:55] <crumpo> Well, that and I discovered programming :P
[01:25:18] <Zipheir> Hah, programming got me into math.
[01:25:52] <Zipheir> Programming courses could do with more math, and math courses could do with more programming, IMO.
[01:26:05] * crumpo nods
[01:26:32] <fantazo> I always found the programming language "math" rather unintuitive and hard to read. no wonder that only a nieche can understand it.
[01:27:02] <Zipheir> Is 'math' a programming language?  Maybe I misunderstood.
[01:27:10] <wasamasa> mathematica is
[01:27:32] <Zipheir> math, interface, ematica, backend...
[01:30:05] <Zipheir> That does remind me, _Computation, Proof, Machine: Mathematics Enters a New Age_ by Gilles Dowek is an interesting book for mathematically-inclined hackers.
[01:31:19] <Zipheir> It gives sort of a shadow history of mathematics from the perspective of computation, which got sort of relegated after Greek axiomatic mathematics.
[01:31:29] <fantazo> I find math in the general realm rather uninteresting. I think school and university killed that inclination.
[01:31:40] <Zipheir> Ouch.
[01:32:21] <wasamasa> it really helps to have some carrot dangling in front of you to get into a particular math topic
[01:32:41] <wasamasa> and then I learn just enough to implement it in code
[01:32:57] <Zipheir> Does anyone ever go carrot-less into a activity?
[01:33:06] <wasamasa> school, university
[01:33:40] <wasamasa> getting through several years of that because of some vague notion it will earn you money is tough
[01:33:47] <Zipheir> True, in many places school is compulsory.
[01:33:56] <wasamasa> going there because you like the topics makes things a lot easier
[01:34:05] <fantazo> I can long muse about software structure, but when I look at match or physics, it all has some kind of snobish sudoku vibe around it.
[01:34:56] <Zipheir> fantazo: As we were saying, a lot of math books have a pretty dry, uncompelling tone.
[01:35:32] <Zipheir> fantazo: Which is why I really, really recommend 7 Sketches in Compositionality (PDF linked above).  It is fun without being patronizing.
[01:35:32] <fantazo> the last rather entertaining thing I read about math was "the fundamentals of arithmetik" by Gottlob Frege.
[01:36:23] <fantazo> 140 or so pages of what it means to add two numbers together.
[01:36:27] <Zipheir> (Also good for those who still think category theory is just abstract nonsense.)
[01:36:58] <Zipheir> fantazo: Of course.  And Russell & Whitehead spent even more pages than that!
[01:37:59] <wasamasa> haskell is abstract nonsense dragging category theory into the mud
[01:38:40] <Zipheir> I think it's also compelling when you learn something about the philosophical context of mathematics.  Logicomix, about Russell and the foundations of mathematics, is a good intro.
[01:39:14] <Zipheir> wasamasa: GHC is concrete nonsense dragging the abstract nonsense into the ... concrete, I guess.
[01:40:58] <fantazo> haskell is good at making the CPU hotter, but by that it's causing a sideeffect and as such it betrays pure functional programming.
[01:41:54] <Zipheir> Ha ha, very funny.
[01:42:35] * fantazo giggles
[01:42:55] <Zipheir> cf. Oleg's Having an Effect video.
[01:43:56] <fantazo> that 7 graphs of category theory, reminds me on an introductory text on cybernetics.
[01:45:19] <Zipheir> Hmm, I suppose I can see that.
[01:45:34] <Zipheir> Apropos, the first sketch of 7 Sketches is about effects.
[01:46:00] <Zipheir> AFK for a bit, back soon.
