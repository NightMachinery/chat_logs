[00:04:16] <matsaman> I mean, effectively you probably can
[00:04:39] <matsaman> you can always send disabled fields to the server if you want, it's up to the server to make sure they're actually disabled as desired
[00:04:51] <matsaman> what in general are you trying to accomplish?
[00:05:13] <friend> this is what I lvoe about CSS, you absolutely cannot do the things that you sometimes can do
[00:05:43] <matsaman> like, you could use generated content to cover an input up
[00:05:49] <matsaman> it's not going to stop someone not using CSS from using the field
[00:05:59] <matsaman> but nothing can stop that, again, except the server actually doing further evaluation
[00:06:01] <friend> I want to toggle the disabled attribute on the sub menu items for hierarchical menu
[00:06:05] <FunkyBob> "An element is disabled if it can't be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus."
[00:06:48] <matsaman> friend: you have form controls as menu items?
[00:06:59] <FunkyBob> if you want to change an input from active to disabled... you'll need JS
[00:07:05] <FunkyBob> but, yeah, what matsaman said :)
[00:07:45] <friend> I have a super-simple hierarchical menu and wanted to not worry about all of this z-indexing crap that doesn't seem to work. I could just translate the drop-downs and disable them so they wouldn't be clickable when inactive.
[00:07:47] <matsaman> disabled like many things is just a convenience, it cannot enforce itself, the server has to
[00:08:00] <matsaman> friend: can we see it?
[00:08:45] <friend> Sure. but it is terrible. I am just learning and so a lot is trial and error. Mostly error.
[00:08:53] <matsaman> 's'okay, we've seen worse I promise you

[00:09:13] <matsaman> here look at this (actually don't, you've been warned): https://webtekrocks.com/clientlist.html
[00:09:46] <matsaman> okay
[00:10:04] <matsaman> maybe this makes sense to you and there's merit in that, but this is one of the most complicated menu implementations of this kind I've ever seen
[00:10:37] <FunkyBob> don't seem to be any inputs in there...
[00:10:47] <friend> Go figure. This is always my problem. I can't ever do anything easy. I always get it blown out of proportion
[00:11:02] <matsaman> hang on
[00:11:10] <matsaman> this is so straightforward it might blow your mind

[00:11:40] <friend> one of several dozen versions that I have been trying to write from scratch becuase I thought it would be so easy.
[00:14:05] <FunkyBob> must say am not a fan of the JS mangling  the HTML to control the chevron
[00:15:24] <FunkyBob> or doing the animations
[00:16:11] <friend> IThe funny thing is that a friend asked me for help with his menu which was worse. So, arrogantly, I sat down and wrote it up really quickly then fell down a rabbit hole only to realize that I still don't get CSS.
[00:16:21] <FunkyBob> heh
[00:16:52] <FunkyBob> it's an eternity of learning, because it's an ever changing target

[00:17:52] <friend> seriously, though. If you can't make a simple hierarchical menu with animated drop-down submenus, it's a problem at any level. I should be able to knock this out in minutes.

[00:23:03] <FunkyBob> so  you want a stateful menu... does it allow more than one sub-menu open at a time?
[00:24:18] <friend> only if it is part of the active heirarchy....so if it's three levels deep, yes all three levels need to be open, but no others.
[00:24:58] <friend> That sounded a lot worse than it was intended.
[00:26:21] <FunkyBob> since when did _padding_ collapse?  I know about margin collapse... but... wow

[00:29:25] <friend> I i only used the UL LI structure to conveniently encapsulate the sub-menus, but I liked it better when I just used the links with divs holding the submenus.
[00:33:51] <FunkyBob> using a list is a common pattern for nav menus
[00:34:02] <FunkyBob> it is, after all, lists of menu items
[00:34:34] <FunkyBob> were t he hrefs placeholders or did you really want to use hierarchical values like that?
[00:34:34] <friend> But with the nav element, lists are not required.
[00:34:38] <FunkyBob> because I could work with that
[00:34:51] <FunkyBob> it's not about  required... it's about expressing structure

[00:37:02] <friend> Since I was just trying to write up an example for my friend (not realizing that I would need help with this), I suggested that the links be literal content in the page rather than worrying about loading contentl. I figured it would be easy to change that after the pretty menu was built.
[00:38:02] <FunkyBob> is that you saying I can't rely on the href values?
[00:38:16] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[00:39:02] <friend> You have me confused there. Are you trying to evaluate the href values to determine if the content is expandable? I don't thnk you can rely on the href values...
[00:39:14] <friend> is there a way to style something based on href values?
[00:41:29] <FunkyBob> no
[00:41:37] <FunkyBob> I'm trying to work out if I can depend on the href values
[00:41:44] <FunkyBob> because they're currently neatly hierarchical
[00:41:59] <FunkyBob> so on click I could set what's selected/open/closed based on that

[00:48:07] <friend> Sorry. I really do appreciate your help. Not sure what I am not getting in your question. The hrefs I used were arbitrary because they were easy to make unique via the structure. I assume the content will also be in a similar hierarchy but some parts may not be loaded and some may be links to other pages entirely so I wouldn't think you'd want to rely on them.

[06:52:19] <michigan> But modernizing and seeing what difference it makes to the weight - that is a service I've been looking for for a long time
[06:54:08] <michigan> My CSS sucks. I'm always like "I'll find somebody later who can write it properly."
[06:57:11] <FunkyBob> it was long long long ago... it (a) wouldn't fit now, and (b) would be well outdated,
[06:57:18] <FunkyBob> flex/grid didn't exist then , for a start
[06:58:01] <michigan> True
[06:58:09] <michigan> Probably not mobile phones either lol
[07:00:47] <Rockwood> could be flex outdated?
[07:00:57] <FunkyBob> what?
[07:01:18] <Rockwood> [08:57:32] <FunkyBob> flex/grid didn't exist then , for a start
[07:01:26] <michigan> Year 2000 seems like yesterday
[07:01:51] <FunkyBob> michigan: ever see those memes about feeling like you're still 20, until you talk to some 20 year olds?

[07:05:43] <FunkyBob> why on earth would anyone do that??
[07:06:39] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, yes if in 2050
[07:07:04] <FunkyBob> maybe, eventually... it's always possible
[07:07:24] * michigan loves to imagine how things will be like in 2050
[07:07:50] <FunkyBob> probably with the same starry eyed hope with which I used to imagine 2000
[07:07:59] <Rockwood> so, what kind of preparation should be now days about it?
[07:08:00] <michigan> lol
[07:08:07] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: nothing
[07:08:23] <FunkyBob> firstly, the chance your web site will still be running in 30 years is low
[07:08:32] <FunkyBob> and if it is... well, you'd have to update it
[07:08:42] <theskillwithin> the learning never ends
[07:08:45] <FunkyBob> that's even IF anyone ever proposes to deprecate such a useful feature
[07:10:24] <Rockwood> monopoly make things harder i think
[07:10:46] <FunkyBob> what monopoly?
[07:10:57] <theskillwithin> FunkyBob ironically,  in a very non-formal way, Rockwood has already proposed it
[07:11:25] <Rockwood> like other languages why not CSS having others option
[07:11:36] <FunkyBob> there was an alternative to CSS in  the early days
[07:11:47] <Rockwood> like PHP , .Net
[07:12:00] <FunkyBob> no
[07:12:09] <FunkyBob> like an actual alternative styling language

[07:12:31] <theskillwithin> jk
[07:12:35] <michigan> I know that our towns and cities will eventually start to resemble this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKNAT3QC01I - maybe future CSS will allow for the same kind of "parametricism"

[07:14:00] <Rockwood> is Abobe Flash paid?
[07:14:01] <michigan> FunkyBob: No doubt :)

[07:14:39] <Rockwood> ah okay
[07:14:49] <theskillwithin> I used to know flash,  in middle school and in high school id sell flash websites for $2k a pop
[07:14:52] <FunkyBob> no, there is no paid-for Flash... it's retired, dead, no longer supported

[07:16:24] <FunkyBob> theskillwithin: yeah, when my wife went to learn web design, they taught her Cold Fusion
[07:16:28] <Rockwood> i am very confuse about one point
[07:17:13] <Rockwood> is possible frontend + backend developer?
[07:17:25] <theskillwithin> they call that fullstack
[07:17:35] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: I do t hat
[07:17:37] <FunkyBob> and more
[07:17:41] <michigan> Rockwood: I do a little bit of backend too (Ruby On Rails)
[07:17:48] <michigan> FunkyBob: haha
[07:17:53] <Rockwood> my question relates to perfection
[07:18:05] <FunkyBob> don't allow perfect to become the enemy of good.

[07:20:18] <Rockwood> may be questions are silly
[07:20:32] <theskillwithin> i thought backends made more
[07:20:37] <Rockwood> nah
[07:21:04] <Rockwood> you can chk freelance work webs
[07:21:05] <theskillwithin> frontend getting more and more complex,  but traditionally backends paid more.  so id assume backends are paid more than frontends still
[07:21:21] <theskillwithin> oh, im talking about salary
[07:21:49] <michigan> yup
[07:21:51] <Rockwood> i am talking about all kind of income in frontend
[07:22:07] <michigan> seems its the backenders and designers that make the money. the frontenders are kinda stuck in between :(

[23:00:47] <michigan> Can anyone tell why the spacing between these articles is so uneven? https://jsfiddle.net/ccccssssssss/dvp20wjb/
[23:03:23] <matsaman> the .vote block is taking up vertical space
[23:04:26] <matsaman> you _can_ use flexbox for almost everything, but you don't have to and might not always want to
[23:04:29] <michigan> Please hold, I need to fix the fiddle a little
[23:04:57] <michigan> hmmm
[23:05:13] <michigan> The abuse potential is huge
[23:05:18] <michigan> It seems
[23:06:49] <hassoon> michigan: use MyFiddle

[23:13:36] <michigan> matsaman: Do I even need grids for this setup?
[23:13:38] <michigan> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/464
[23:14:44] <hassoon> michigan: it's doable with grid, but it depends on your taste
[23:16:26] <matsaman> I'm not sure how much flexbox does that you couldn't do before without it
[23:16:34] <matsaman> there are some things it's particularly convenient for
[23:17:01] <matsaman> but you'll have to learn a hell of a lot about it to use it for everything
[23:17:37] <michigan> hmm. I'd rather drop these grids, and like you say only use flexbox when absolutely necessary
[23:17:42] <hassoon> michigan: ya try it in grid, obviously you need to define spots for each kind of content in each container, grid is good for that
[23:19:00] <michigan> here's how the uneven space looks like in my real app:
[23:19:51] <michigan> https://imgur.com/a/TAJR4x9
[23:21:27] <matsaman> I think you just need to address the layout of each item individually
[23:21:33] <matsaman> what you have is a line of rows
[23:21:43] <matsaman> within those rows you have two "columns" or sides, left & right
[23:21:48] <hassoon> michigan: you can give the voter container a fixed height, and the comments height stay variable
[23:21:54] <matsaman> do that first, then it'll be less complicated
[23:22:00] <hassoon> and on top of that the whole bigger container is always scrollable
[23:22:02] <hassoon> so it's alwys fi,e
[23:22:05] <hassoon> * fine$
[23:22:13] <matsaman> when left is separate from right, the layout of left won't affect right
[23:23:23] <matsaman> so you can easily use flexbox still
[23:23:35] <matsaman> hey flex box give me these things in a stack
[23:23:50] <matsaman> hey flex box, give me these other things, within each of these things, in a horizontally separated left & right area
[23:24:06] <matsaman> and _then_ you deal with the vertical of the items in the left area, only within that left area
[23:26:12] <michigan> "hey flex box" lol
[23:26:16] <michigan> brilliant :D

[23:27:45] <krish> Can someone please help me? I'm trying to figure out how to center my content inside of a 375 width viewport but for some reason the content pushes to the right when I add a margin to the entire content
[23:27:57] <krish> https://jsfiddle.net/4s0ntp9d/
[23:28:08] <krish> ive tried different things and I cant get it to center while having a small margin on the left and right sides
[23:28:17] <krish> itll add the margin to the left side but push the remaining content out of the viewport, so that they have to scroll to access the rest of the content

[23:36:42] <matsaman> krish: tables?
[23:36:45] <matsaman> is this for email?
[23:37:00] <krish> yes
[23:37:07] <krish> it is for email matsaman
[23:37:16] <matsaman> and that's specifically why you're using tables?
[23:37:22] <krish> yes
[23:37:44] <matsaman> the main reason things don't look centered to me, at 375 width, is that some of the table areas have entirely empty right-side columns
[23:38:03] <matsaman> is it some other issue you're talking about?
[23:38:08] <krish> yes, outside the table
[23:38:26] <krish> there should be a small little margin on the left and right side of things
[23:38:39] <krish> like at the top below the image, the big box, it should have a left side and right side margin
[23:38:46] <krish> or below it it says 2 items shipped
[23:38:59] <krish> the line underneath that should have a little spacing on the right and left side of it
[23:39:03] <matsaman> oh I can't see your images, hmmm
[23:39:11] <krish> well tbh the images arent important
[23:39:28] <matsaman> so you have
[23:39:30] <matsaman> <img>text text
[23:39:31] <krish> its mainly the outter most table that needs a margin
[23:39:39] <matsaman> you probably want to display: block; those img elements
[23:39:51] <matsaman> or put in a <br> if stupid email needs it
[23:39:56] <matsaman> or put it in its own <tr><td>
[23:40:08] <matsaman> display: block; margin: 0 auto;, etc.
[23:40:50] <krish> so basically any img text text, add a display: block to the img elements
[23:41:06] <krish> is that whats causing the margin to not display properly?
[23:43:42] <matsaman> quite possibly
[23:44:03] <matsaman> <img>text on its own is not something that will try to wrap the 'text' to another line
[23:44:16] <matsaman> '<img> text' would, but
[23:44:26] <matsaman> even then, you really don't' want to rely on white space for layout
[23:44:34] <krish> is there a line you can paste to me
[23:44:41] <krish> an offending <img> text line
[23:44:57] <matsaman> they all seem like that
[23:44:59] <matsaman> 'truckShip.jpg">2 ITEMS SHIPPE'
[23:45:06] <matsaman> 'time.jpg">1 ITEM NOT YET SHIP'
[23:45:36] <krish> i see
[23:45:58] <matsaman> oh okay
[23:46:09] <krish> so basically the content inside the tables can stretch the content outside the viewport?
[23:46:22] <matsaman> it can, tables will do that by default under some circumstances
[23:46:25] <matsaman> but also
[23:46:30] <matsaman> you might not actually want to specify any widths
[23:46:38] <matsaman> 'max-width', perhaps, but not 'width'
[23:47:03] <krish> ya ive been trying anything under the sun to try to get the tables to conform to what I want them to
[23:47:08] <krish> i gotta go back and remove a bunch of stuff
[23:47:14] <krish> okay ill change those to max width
[23:47:24] <krish> its my first time working with html tables in depth
[23:47:44] <krish> thanks for the tip
[23:48:00] <krish> ill try them out and report back
[23:53:16] <matsaman> a lot of this should obviously not be tables, but HTML in email is a clusterfsck of insanity
[23:53:31] <matsaman> so if you gotta use HTML in email, all rules are out the window
[23:54:24] <krish> yeah
[23:54:31] <krish> thats the tough part lol
[23:54:39] <krish> im like 90% done and i cant get the rest to align right
