[00:00:04] <The_Blode> Nice Albright
[00:00:20] <The_Blode> I pale in comparison. Been doing it professionally for the last 4 years.
[00:00:32] <Albright_> And there are still many people who are better at this than me, and many of them are younger than me. oh well.
[00:01:14] <The_Blode> Actually, I know there are people out there better than everyone in this channel...but we are the best we can be right? I getting all gushy there my bad
[00:01:34] <The_Blode> I haven't come from a classical programming background so I don't have the "ego" that some programmers have
[00:01:35] <Albright_> At this point in time, sure, let's go with that
[00:01:42] <The_Blode> Some don't and are very humble though
[00:01:44] <__adrian> heh
[00:01:56] <__adrian> you don't need a classical background to have an ego.
[00:02:02] <The_Blode> Oh
[00:02:12] <The_Blode> My two seniors at work have big egos
[00:02:12] <NoiseEee> C=94 in 1993 ... it was p old by then, no Albright_ ?
[00:02:17] <The_Blode> Is that just personality traits?
[00:02:29] <Albright_> NoiseEee: Yes. That's why my uncle gave it to me. He got a 386 or whatever.
[00:02:31] *** de-facto_ is now known as de-facto
[00:02:37] <NoiseEee> Albright_: right!
[00:02:51] <da_wunder> my first computer was vic-20
[00:02:58] <The_Blode> I think in 1993 I had an Amiga 500
[00:03:07] <The_Blode> Vic-20 cool!
[00:03:24] <Sammitch> I used to work with an _actual_ rockstar programmer, IMHO. the company was _horrid_ and I tried to convince him that he could go literally _anywhere_ else and be better appreciated and probably add a zero to his salary, but the company was very good at gaslighting people
[00:04:29] <The_Blode> My tutor, a wunderkin type developer, helped me develop programming skills but he did so in an acerbic manner. He would say "go and read the file, come back to me and tell me your understanding" it was kinda gruelling.
[00:04:42] <The_Blode> However, I learned and became competent with practise.
[00:05:10] <The_Blode> When I'm training these seniors today, I am not doing that to them. I'm holding their hands.
[00:05:33] <__adrian> if you have to hand-hold they're probably not all that ready to be seniors
[00:05:55] <Albright_> Agreed
[00:06:17] <Albright_> But "Senior" means different things in different companies, I guess. I was a "senior" at one company three years into my career
[00:06:35] <The_Blode> In my company, it only refers to pay grade.
[00:06:45] <Sammitch> I'm "senior" here by virtue of being the only one left :P
[00:06:49] <The_Blode> I'm classed as "mid level" but I do the exact same work as the seniors and vice versa
[00:08:00] <The_Blode> Sammitch: oh no
[00:08:15] <The_Blode> I actually had one of the seniors on the phone to me today in tears
[00:08:19] <The_Blode> So I tried to console her
[00:08:35] <The_Blode> Not very successfully but yeah

[00:11:31] <da_wunder> stenno: nope irssi is the best with https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.iki.murgo.irssinotifier&hl=en&gl=US :D
[00:11:37] <The_Blode> But why half @$$ it if we're getting paid for it
[00:11:50] <da_wunder> that irssinotifier developer is my former co-worker
[00:12:46] <stenno> oh thats nice
[00:13:10] <stenno> hmm i wanna write that for weechat
[00:13:14] <stenno> that shouldn't be too difficult
[00:13:29] <Albright_> Yes, I definitely agree with the "take pride" part. And we should feel shame if we write a dumb bug, or we look back at code we wrote five years ago.
[00:14:42] <da_wunder> Albright_: for me it's enough to look two week old code - there is always something to improve

[00:26:47] <Albright_> Well, you can do profiling, if that's your real task.

[00:40:55] <Albright_> Not a great plan, I know. But Plan B (occasional PowerBall tickets) isn't working out either.
[00:41:30] <biberu> what's wrong with programming then?
[00:42:21] <Albright_> Nothing.
[00:42:49] <Albright_> Maybe I don't understand your question, if that was directed at me.
[00:43:32] <biberu> yeah, the not a great plan part, or perhaps that was just about not having retirement savings? ^^

[01:48:10] <monaco> Hello there sorry for asking this first of all I would like a hand here if someone can explain to me how I can make this accept only .png files http://hastebin.com/ayaketaqeh.php if possible and have the time to add it up !
[01:48:39] <Blondie101010> jochum:  that discussion is not suitable here...  use your judgement, experiment, and search online
[01:48:41] <Sammitch> in many cases the "best" solution is the one that is already configured and running, and is giving you no real reason to change. it might not be the way that we might deploy it today, but if it ain't broke don't break it.
[01:49:18] <TinoDidriksen> monaco, use https://php.net/file_info to detect whether it's really a PNG and reject if it's not.
[01:50:31] <Sammitch> file extensions are largely meaningless, and determining the actual filetype is extremely non-trivial. use a library like the one Tino has suggested
[01:51:10] <Blondie101010> yes, but what strikes me is their condition
[01:51:48] <monaco> Sammitch: and TinoDidriksen I tried I can't come to a solution that's why I am here if anyone could help me possibly
[01:52:04] <Blondie101010> monaco: is there ever something in $_FILES['png']['name']?
[01:53:32] <Blondie101010> or the other way around
[01:54:10] <harpia> jochum: Ubuntu/Debian for some reason still defaults to mod-php, but they also provide the 'php-fpm' package, which gives you a pretty good proxy setup out of the box. It's what I use. It's the default in Fedora. php-fpm is supposed to have better performance over mod-php.

[12:58:59] <TinoDidriksen> $fileNameNew doesn't exist in that scope.
[12:59:59] <TinoDidriksen> Also, you must NOT trust the uploaded filename. Check that the file is actually of the given format with file_info.
[13:00:09] <TernaryOperator> monaco: get yourself a decent IDE (phpstorm), it will *immediately* not only flag that but tell you why
[13:01:03] <TernaryOperator> also those's elses at the end make no sense

[13:02:03] <TernaryOperator> also line 3 I think you probably wanted 'file' not file :)
[13:02:24] <TernaryOperator> since file without quotes is a constant (and from your post not set)

[15:25:39] <AllenJB> Because an IDE like PHPStorm gives you so much more in the way of tools, inspections and helpful features. Yeah, you can modify many editors to give you some of that, but you'll probably never get to what a good IDE gives you out-of-the-box
[15:26:21] <undefined_bob> chao: it does uses highlights and some kinda autocomplete
[15:26:59] <undefined_bob> I think you are right, AllenJB
[15:27:22] <AllenJB> In my experience even the syntax highlighting provided by text editors is relatively basic and doesn't fully understand PHP, in addition to frequently not being fully up-to-date.

[16:08:13] <TernaryOperator> in addition, phpstorm gives you first class support for html/javascript/typescript, best in class database tools, has awesome plugins for static analysis, actually *understands* the code so things like "extract method"/general refactoring simply work
[16:08:44] <TernaryOperator> If you are happy with an editor by all means use it but if you scratch the surface of phpstorm (or in my case intellij, same thing with the php ext) you'll not want to go back
[16:09:31] <TernaryOperator> and while it's a holy war and undecidable in the general case, I think for a *beginner* having the IDE not only tell you *what* is wrong but why it is wrong is a definite win
[16:09:58] <TernaryOperator> doubly so because it'll suggest *better* ways of doing the thing you just did which is useful
[16:11:01] <undefined_bob> the why thing is definitely good
[16:11:17] <TernaryOperator> undefined_bob: it can do stuff like suggest that that an if could be a ternary, find duplicated blocks of code, you can select a logical block and extract it to a method and it'll correctly infer all the parameters etc
[16:11:56] <undefined_bob> but its sounds like much of the work is done by the IDE and not by the programmer anymore
[16:12:01] <TernaryOperator> since it has a much better understand of the code as code than as text, rename/find usages/show hierarchy/show structure all simply work better
[16:12:14] <TernaryOperator> undefined_bob: hopefully
[16:12:23] <undefined_bob> I would prefer to let beginners do it all by hand to get a better understanding of it
[16:12:25] <TernaryOperator> I have limited brain capacity, I don't want to waste it on anything the machine can do for me
[16:12:53] <TernaryOperator> undefined_bob: I wouldn't, it's about efficiently learning why shouldn't do things and the IDE will *show you* in many cases
[16:13:00] <Naktibalda> undefined_bob: IDE doesn't do work for you, it points out your mistakes
[16:13:28] <TernaryOperator> if you want to get really fancy stuff like https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7622-php-inspections-ea-extended-
[16:13:33] <Naktibalda> There is nothing like Github Autopilot in PhpStorm
[16:13:36] <TernaryOperator> that will stop you shooting yourself in the foot in interesting ways

[17:51:02] <endersending> could someone look at this pastebin and maybe give me some suggestions on how I can fix this https://pastebin.com/Sw07wjVN
[17:51:12] <endersending> I was running nextcloud 17.0.20 on freebsd 12.0 with php 7.2 and had a certificate expiration problem.. being not smart, I upgraded the system, which fixed the certificate problem, but upgrade php to 7.4 which nextcloud 17 doesnt like. So I moved nextcloud to a different server with php 7.3 and now I am getting this error
[17:51:44] <endersending> It seems like a simple fix, but cannot figure it out. any help would be appreciated

[20:11:01] <relipse> that means editor can have access to prod directly

[23:24:29] <noobiewan> I have this method I want to test, the method react differently depending on the result of a php native function call. Ideally I would like to mock the response of this php function, but I can't. I tried introducing a class wrapper for this function but then I have a hard dependency. Any suggestions?
[23:25:22] <noobiewan> The function in question is iconv, which depends on the charset installed in the server. So basically my method will check if iconv call worked and if not, do something differently.

[23:32:50] <noobiewan> da_wunder, what changes is the response of iconv which depends on the server configuration, the input is the same
[23:32:53] <biberu> yes, to alter the behavior for the test in question
[23:33:35] <da_wunder> noobiewan: use data provider to make that input to fail...
[23:34:10] <noobiewan> da_wunder how?
[23:34:15] <biberu> you could also inject a function to take the place of iconv, either way just don't call it directly, wrap it in something replaceable
[23:34:39] <noobiewan> I don't want to inject something because then it gets to complicated to use
[23:35:29] <biberu> no, it doesn't have to be
[23:35:32] <da_wunder> so something like /** @dataprovider foo */function testConvert(string $fromEncoding, string $toEncoding, string $string) { ... }
[23:36:32] <biberu> you could have a default configuration built up from smaller components that's used during actual execution, and compose them differently while testing
[23:36:41] <da_wunder> and then make your dataprovider to somethign like; public foo { yield['UTF-8', 'ISO-8858-1', 'some string...']; }
[23:36:47] <biberu> your ordinary code wouldn't see the difference
[23:37:28] <da_wunder> so just yield test cases that you need
[23:37:33] <noobiewan> biberu, basically I want to replace all iconv() calls that I have with this new method that's why ideally I wanted it to be a static method
[23:40:09] <da_wunder> and really, you could also just remove that error_get_last() there, if you change your application to convert those errors to exceptions, so then you could assert that specified exception is thrown in you test
[23:40:50] <noobiewan> yep, but it's in a library so can't relly on that
[23:41:02] <noobiewan> or can I?
[23:41:27] <da_wunder> hmm, why you need to test some library functionality? that library itself should do that
[23:41:34] <noobiewan> I'm working on a library
[23:41:47] <noobiewan> private library
[23:41:53] *** Quits: Gamara (gamara@66-203-186-178.ded.execulink.com) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[23:41:57] <da_wunder> so then change that library to be more testable
[23:42:36] <biberu> sounds like that's why he's trying to do? :)
[23:42:44] <noobiewan> yes
[23:44:58] <da_wunder> so, refactor that `error_get_last` out - make those errors to thrown an exceptions - use data providers in your test to cover each test case where you catch those exceptions
[23:48:05] <noobiewan> honestly I didn't understand how data provider would help me mock the result of native function calls.
[23:49:28] <da_wunder> you provide false data for that native function, and then you've that error to exception thing there, catch that error in your test
[23:50:52] <da_wunder> your data provider is giving those parameter for that native function - so you could pass every use case there as you like and then just catch that exception and see if that is correct one
[23:51:11] <noobiewan> but the params passed to the native function are the ones I need later if the function fails
[23:51:39] <noobiewan> I'm going with the overwriting, seems it will work
[23:53:03] <da_wunder> still don't see the problem there - you have those input parameters in your test method, you're passing those from that data provider...
[23:53:07] *** Quits: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:54:45] <da_wunder> oh, looked your code again - so you don't want to convert those possible errors to exceptions - as I though - so just leave that part out and it should work just fine
