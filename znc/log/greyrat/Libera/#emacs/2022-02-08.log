[04:02:23] <grym> and it's author ought to have known
[04:03:24] <grym> martial arts, writ large, all adhere more to the first of those than the second
[04:03:32] <grym> how much, is a matter of degree

[04:04:41] <twb> MMA is 100% jutsu
[04:04:47] <ggb> grym: that's something that shows up elswhere as well. Do vs jutsu is a dichotomy in several Japanese martial arts. Do is a way or a path something you follow as a part of life. Jutsu is a method or a technique - a tool you use to achieve an end..

[05:00:17] <technomancy> imagine copying emacs and completely missing the actually good part

[05:00:22] <AeroNotix> right?!?!
[05:00:41] <ggb> So yes, not extensible: Since it is written completely in C, there is currently no language in which extensions can be written; however, keys can be rebound and certain parameters can be changed in startup files.

[08:16:18] <phyto> only evil, but that is because i had initially installed it via M-x package-install
[08:17:16] <Guest0864> what happens if you uninstall that package with emacs' package manager?

[08:41:25] <bobdobbs> I've broken spacemacs and I can't figure out how exactly. At the moment when I start emacs with --debug-init, I get this: http://pastie.org/p/2MYOfggJzKkvB0YVAW03l4

[08:45:28] <bobdobbs> corwin: I installed it via spacemacs, and then load it manually in a buffer when I'm trying to configure it.

[09:02:37] <Guest0864> bobdobbs is it possible that your entire install can't find any packages and it's just erroring out one at a time now -_-

[09:03:10] <bobdobbs> Guest0864: yes. that is possible. that's one thing I was thinking

[12:23:47] <irek> hello o/
[12:27:12] <buhtz> I still found out that the elpy maintainer is looking for a new maintainer. I wonder if there are alternatives to elpy for me. Because I only use syntax highlighting and PEP8 checking - not more. Elpy offers to much. Any suggestions about syntax highlighting and checking for Python code?
[12:27:29] * buhtz even invokes the python interpreter and unittest via commandline outside Emac
[12:27:47] <wasamasa> syntax highlighting is done by python.el already
[12:28:10] <wasamasa> linting can be done via flymake (built-in) or flycheck (external)
[12:28:31] <wasamasa> elpy uses flycheck for that

[12:29:51] <buhtz> sounds nice and easier to handle and install. Any suggestions about a howto tutorial for that? When searching for Python and emacs I always find elpy related stuff.
[12:29:52] <bkhl> I'm pretty happy with python.el+Eglot
[12:30:22] <bkhl> Eglot is one way to get linting (and formatting) through flymake
[12:31:17] <buhtz> eglot has something to do with language server protocols. I need to learn about that because I never understand why there have to be a server just for syntax features. Do I have to install a server instance? Or does it send my code to an external server (maybe google, amazon, ...) in the internat?

[18:20:57] <lampilelo> i guess you're right
[18:21:02] <bremner> lampilelo: I don't say people should only use customize, but I think that people that refuse to use customize should not expect me to tell them how to do things 2 other ways

[23:25:57] <theothornhill> What is the consensus on (setq require-final-newline t)? Is that good/bad practice?
[23:26:39] <bremner> it's fine, I think.
[23:26:48] <thuna`> theothornhill: What's the argument for it?
[23:27:07] <theothornhill> Well, git wants a final newline. Apart from that, not much, I guess?
[23:27:10] <bremner> some people insist that a text file must end with a new line
[23:27:26] <Catie> Sorry to say I'm one of them
[23:27:26] <bremner> s/people/software/
[23:27:45] <bremner> Catie: yeah, I remember some standard /RFC / whatever that supports this position
[23:27:59] <ggb> elpy won't evaluate a block that ends in EOF without newline.
[23:28:01] <bremner> other people edit weird files, and don't want added newlines
[23:28:28] <bremner> I think it's a reasonable default, and people that know better can disable it
[23:28:32] <theothornhill> It's been in my init.el forever, but i just noticed it today when reading a file yielding a final empty element. Couldn't get rid of the thing until I turned it off..
[23:28:48] <bremner> theothornhill: if that
[23:28:56] <bremner> is your parser, consider making it more robust
[23:29:15] <Catie> I don't like (setq require-final-newline t) if only because it restricts what I'm allowed to do. But I always put a final newline in my files for prettier cattage
[23:29:17] <theothornhill> Hehe yeah, this was just some simple AoC thing
[23:29:39] <acdw> I require exactly 'floor(log(lines % 1000))' new lines at the end of my file
[23:29:39] <ville> theothornhill: depending if you do c++ programming, and which version of it, terminating newline may be required for headers
[23:30:09] <theothornhill> acdw: now that's a reasonable default
[23:30:19] <bremner> acdw: +1, and we're good
[23:30:22] <acdw> it's served me well
[23:30:34] <thuna`> bremner: you mean 1+?
[23:30:38] <acdw> bremner: nope that won't work, i have very specfici needs
[23:30:47] <theothornhill> ville: Right, I think there are more languages needing that as well.  Ok, I'll keep it
[23:31:05] <Catie> acdw: You should see about getting that integrated into mainline, I think it would help a lot of people
[23:31:50] <theothornhill> agreed
[23:32:38] <thuna`> How (if at all) does everyone VC their emacs config?
[23:33:21] <theothornhill> git add . && git commit :)
[23:33:47] <thuna`> But what directory is the git in?
[23:34:45] <theothornhill> I use stow and have a folder called .dotfiles. so the path to my .emacs is ~/.dotfiles/emacs/.emacs.d
[23:35:01] <ggb> M-x magit s cc
[23:35:03] <theothornhill> git root is in .dotfiles
[23:35:17] <acdw> thuna`: git clone https://tildegit.org/acdw/emacs ~/.emacs.d
[23:35:25] <acdw> or sometimes ~/.config/emacs, but w/e

[23:35:45] <ggb> On any machine I make ~/src and clone my sysconfig repo. In there is a script to selectively link configs to appropriate places.
[23:35:48] <acdw> maybe i should write a dotfile manager in scheme, for fun
[23:35:53] <thuna`> acdw: So you have the entire .emacs.d as a git?
[23:35:56] <acdw> yes
[23:36:03] <acdw> my .gitignore is important
[23:36:11] <theothornhill> same, but lots of stuff in .gitignore
