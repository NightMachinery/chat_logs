[02:28:52] <gwern> 'Kananga suggested the stunt of Bond (played by Roger Moore) jumping on crocodiles, and was enlisted by the producers to perform it.[7] The scene required five takes to complete, including one in which the last crocodile snapped at Kananga's heel, tearing his trousers and causing him a number of injuries. One required 193 stitches. Kananga was paid $60,000 for his contribution.[6][8]...The...
[02:28:58] <gwern> ...same year, various news reports described Kananga being attacked by his male leopard Satan, and how he was saved by 19-year-old Brenda Surles, who was forced to shoot the animal on Kananga’s orders. Surles only wounded the animal. Kananga killed the animal before collapsing. Surles was also required to shoot and kill Satan's partner, Angel' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Kananga...

[05:04:36] <two2thehead> "Most of them were school-related factors and had a direct association or a mediating role on homophobic bullying such as:  peer group and social support either from the parents or other adults at the school (see Birkett & Espelage, 2015; D‘Urso & Pace, 2019; Erhard & Ben-Ami, 2016;Ybarra, Mitchell, Palmer, & Reisner, 2015) followed by school belonging (Hatchel,Espelage, & Huang, 2018; Hatchel, Merrin, & Espelage, 2018) and lackof trust betwee
[05:04:37] <two2thehead> n peers (D‘Ursoet al., 2018). Although not directly related to school, self-compassion was a protective factor of homophobic bullying (Vigna, Poehlmann-Tynan, & Koenig, 2018). Finally, from a school-related perspective, inclusive education, policies and supportive curricula also reduce homophobic bullying (see Boyland, Kirkeby, & Boyland,2018; Greytak, Kosciw, & Boesen, 2013; Kull, Greytak, Kosciw, & Villenas,2016). Other socio-demographi
[05:04:37] <two2thehead> c variables were studied, such rural areas and age. In particular, rural areas may contribute to greater victimization and hostile school climates (Kosciw, Greytak, & Diaz, 2009; Kosciw, Palmer, & Kull, 2014), while age seemed to have no effect on the range between 13 to 17 years (Minton, 2014), althoughone study indicated that homophobic bullying increases throughout adolescence (Sterzing, Gibbs, Gartner, & Goldbach, 2018)."
[05:05:14] <quanticle> I mean, I'm glad we have a study for it
[05:05:32] <two2thehead> An excellent foundational study imo. I was surprised to see that the stereotype of rural america being unwelcoming to LGBT types was a) real and b) show up on surveys
[05:05:39] <quanticle> But uh... "Homophobic bullying increasing during adolescence" is pretty obvious to anyone who's ever been an adolescent in the past 20 years
[05:06:02] <two2thehead> I know, i know, 'water is wet' but I didn't read any proof earlier

[05:08:22] <quanticle> Also the rural areas thing goes back to what I was saying about rationalists who bemoan living in an "atomized society" or whatever. They never stop to consider that they might be the bullied outcasts in this ideal pre-industrial close-knit society that they wish they had. 
[05:09:14] <quanticle> Kind of like all those people who wish they could live in a fantasy novel never stop to consider that, in all likelihood, they wouldn't be the lord leading the armies, they'd be the foot soldiers at the edge of the screen getting slaughtered.

[05:11:02] <quanticle> Yeah. As someone who had the experience of being literally the only minority in a school of 200... yeah, I don't recommend it. I like the modern atomized society.

[05:37:20] <catern> gwern: btw, the reason I thought about the API/transaction costs analogy in the first place is that I was searching for a way to explain that "distributed system" doesn't mean that *everything* needs to, well, be distributed, and talk over stable APIs, and use consensus protocols, etc; and why instead it's nice to have subsets of the system which are "centrally planned" as such

[06:24:35] <gwern> they don't tell you these things as a kid. no one really writes it down.

[06:26:06] <gwern> man, I was always really confused when I looked up a ref in a book and saw it was some sort of 'journal' and I went 'where the *fuck* do I get *that*? if it had an ISBN I know I could ask my library for it. but 'the Journal of Zoology'? my library doesn't subscribe to that'

I'd short zuckerberg's popularity/political-prospects in the short term, but buy them on the multi-decade timespan. when he finally stops looking like a kid, gets some gray, figures out the right haircut and facial hair, he may suddenly turn into branson or bezos in terms of alphamale status

[18:26:24] <kuudes> quanticle, re our much earlier discussion: we agreed that covid vaccines reduce grave consequences by factor of 10% and disagreed on if that is enough. I did some thinking on this and I think I could maybe agree with you if we got the factor to 1%, ie double of current
[18:26:31] <kuudes> .note quanticle re our much earlier discussion: we agreed that covid vaccines reduce grave consequences by factor of 10% and disagreed on if that is enough. I did some thinking on this and I think I could maybe agree with you if we got the factor to 1%, ie double of current
[18:27:27] <kuudes> the levels on https://www.microcovid.org/ are 0.1% "high caution", 1% "standard caution", 3% "low caution" and 10% "harm reduction"
[18:27:53] <kuudes> so 10% lowering allows increase of budget by factor of 10x, so from high caution to standard caution and standard caution -> harm reduction
[18:27:56] <feep> nshepperd2: I see, the one ring may only be destroyed in mount doom where it was forged, because that's where sauron keeps the root key
[18:28:31] <adiabatic> kuudes: by 10% (reducing it to 90%), a small lowering, or reducing it _to_ 10% (reducing it by 90%), a large amount?
[18:28:52] <kuudes> by factor of 10%
[18:29:12] <kuudes> ie if you previously had, say 5% chance for consequence, now you have after 2 doses 0.5% chance for the same
[18:29:28] <feep> "factor of 10%" is a bit unusual way to phrase it
[18:29:37] <adiabatic> yeah, no native English speaker would say that
[18:29:39] <kuudes> well, it is the complement of "efficiency of 90%"
[18:29:46] <feep> I think factor of 10 is more common
[18:29:58] <kuudes> but it is not factor of 10
[18:30:02] <feep> I know
[18:30:03] <feep> nonetheless
[18:30:04] <adiabatic> "reduce by a factor of 10" is nerdy but clear
[18:30:09] <kuudes> if the efficiency would be 95% then it would be 20
[18:30:25] <feep> adiabatic: strictly it's a divisor of 10
[18:30:26] <kuudes> and I am voicing I would want 99%
[18:30:41] <kuudes> summand of 1 means +1, factor of 2 means *2
[18:30:42] <feep> I think the point is people say factor anyway
[18:30:53] <feep> kuudes: that's formally correct but not colloquially
[18:30:58] <feep> colloquially factor means both *2 and /2
[18:30:59] <kuudes> divisor of 10?
[18:31:08] <feep> that's formally correct but nobody says it.
[18:31:12] <kuudes> yes, but that is incorrect and we nerds would get confused.
[18:31:17] <feep> SUCH IS LIFE.

[18:31:26] <nshepperd2> feep: throw it into revocation certificate, frodo!
[18:31:51] <feep> kuudes: like, factor is... *really* widespread phrasing.
[18:32:05] <kuudes> yes, but people are idiots and we don't need them here now
[18:32:11] <kuudes> but. 99% would be nice
[18:32:12] <feep> you are talking to #lesswrong which is the *only* reason *anyone* here can guess what "factor of 10%" means
[18:32:14] <kuudes> we are not there yet
[18:32:33] <kuudes> 90% is not enough imo
[18:32:34] <feep> nobody else outside a maths department would understand that.
[18:32:36] <feep> I'm just saying.
[18:32:48] <kuudes> I don't care, voice it elsewhere, you are cluttering

[21:20:53] <gwern> 'about 20-some years ago, I heard a story about an acquaintance of mine who gave a talk on "Weil estimates" for algebraic curves. You probably don't know what those are, but suffice it to say that it's some high-powered math that formed an important foundation to modern Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry. However, my acquaintance didn't give Deligne's proof of the Weil estimates, he gave an...

He said that one of the old-guard algebraic geometers got up during the lecture and started scolding him with something like, "You just want to make a mockery of this subject. What you said isn't deep or interesting, and I don't know why I even bothered to come here and see you...

[22:48:35] <dbohdan> quanticle: 'Also the rural areas thing goes back to what I was saying about rationalists who bemoan living in an "atomized society" or whatever. They never stop to consider that they might be the bullied outcasts in this ideal pre-industrial close-knit society that they wish they had.'  Yep.  Personally, atomize me harder.  I guess this complaint is more legit when postrats voice it, since they at least tend to signal interest in "going native" in some 
[22:48:35] <dbohdan> established community or belief system.  Then again, maybe the previous statement is tautological, because wanting to "go native" in some belief system may just be the defining feature of a postrationalist.
