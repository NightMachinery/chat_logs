[00:08:04] <theseb> https://dpaste.org/FkRk <--- Why did CodenameTime say the 1st view isn't scalable but the 2nd one is?
[00:08:17] <theseb> i don't see it
[00:08:23] <theseb> they both seem fine to me
[00:15:15] <Steve-Dusty> guys
[00:15:15] <CodenameTim> theseb: `bad_view` will result in sql that will set the value to what's in memory in the view. So if multiple views all pull the data at the same time, say a counter value of 2, they will all update the database to be 3. The second will tell the database to update the value to 1 plus the current value.

[00:15:34] <CodenameTim> Sorry, I should have explained that originally.
[00:16:13] <CodenameTim> Steve-Dusty: You're looking for the Model Meta option `verbose_name_plural` https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/options/#verbose-name-plural
[00:18:50] <Steve-Dusty> I didn't put verbose_name_plural anywhere..
[00:19:03] <CodenameTim> theseb: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/expressions/#f-expressions This section goes into a bit more detail
[00:20:27] <CodenameTim> Steve-Dusty: Yup, that's the issue. The plural of Class in English is Classes, but Django by default will append a `s` to the verbose name. To get Classes that default needs to be overridden.
[00:22:17] <CodenameTim> To clarify, that part of the django admin which is showing `Classs` is attempting to render the plural version of your model.
[00:24:48] <theseb> CodenameTim: thanks!

[06:24:16] <Steve-Dusty> many websites don't have a <pk> number in their path
[06:24:18] <Steve-Dusty> urls*
[06:24:29] <Steve-Dusty> how do in-production websites hide them
[06:24:39] <FunkyBob> there are many ways
[06:24:52] <FunkyBob> slugs were a common approach early on in django [and you still see it a lot]
[06:25:25] <FunkyBob> there's also bi-directional scrambles... so you put in the pk, and it gives out a random looking string... which you can reverse to get the pk again
[06:27:30] <Steve-Dusty> why would people do that?
[06:27:33] <Steve-Dusty> so it doesnt look ugly?
[06:29:25] <hemebond> Slugs are good because the URL gives a hint about the target.
[06:29:52] <FunkyBob> the scrambles we used to use to make order numbers not look sequential
[06:29:54] <hemebond> Even many forum software uses slugs in addition to their K.
[06:30:03] <hemebond> *PK
[06:30:14] <FunkyBob> yeah, some news sites combine a slug and pk in the url...
[06:30:24] <FunkyBob> turns out for some, you can change the slug to anything you like :P
[06:30:30] <hemebond> The slug itself is ignored but it helps show what the URL is pointing to.
[06:33:00] <Steve-Dusty> why is express more popular than django?
[06:33:16] <FunkyBob> is it?
[06:33:42] <Steve-Dusty> yes when you search up "backend development" you see a bunch of express stuff
[06:33:56] <Steve-Dusty> rarely django :(
[06:33:58] <FunkyBob> a crude measure
[06:34:28] <FunkyBob> I suspect partly because of all the SPA people realising they need server side rendering to not completely munt their search rankings and performance :P
[06:35:04] <FunkyBob> also contributing, all the JS devs moving into server-side want to leverage their existing language skills
[06:38:06] <Steve-Dusty> do you know Node?
[06:38:23] <FunkyBob> i have to work with it some

[07:51:32] <FunkyBob> object is the class instance the view is detailing...
[07:51:51] <FunkyBob> there is no 'object_list' in the context, because it's a DetailView
[07:52:10] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/zqrz
[07:52:12] <FunkyBob> there is 'object' , which is the specific Class
[07:52:15] <Steve-Dusty> o h
[07:52:29] <Steve-Dusty> because it's only individually
[07:52:38] <Steve-Dusty> wait.... so I shouldn't be using DetailView

[07:52:51] <FunkyBob> you're showing details of a single Class, yes?
[07:52:55] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[07:53:01] <FunkyBob> then use a DetailView

[07:54:09] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/B0Ea still doesn't show

[08:09:10] <FunkyBob> ok... and you're certainl t he matching Class record (a) has a name set, (b) has related students ?
[08:09:17] *** Quits: gkr (~gkr@78.199.13.26) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[08:09:23] <FunkyBob> also, when you added 'steb'... to where did you add it?
[08:09:33] *** Joins: gkr (~gkr@37.165.227.162)
[08:09:44] <Steve-Dusty> outside of the for loop
[08:10:00] <FunkyBob> don't skip questions
[08:10:35] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[08:10:40] <Steve-Dusty> i added students in admin
[08:11:59] <FunkyBob> and yet {{ object.class_name }} or {{ object.teacher }} don't show anything/
[08:12:06] <FunkyBob> you added students, did you set class_name ?
[08:12:09] <Steve-Dusty> no, it's the for loop
[08:12:15] <Steve-Dusty> I added "steb" inside the for loop
[08:12:18] <FunkyBob> (i mean, you must have... it's not blankable)
[08:12:18] <Steve-Dusty> it didn't show anything
[08:12:40] <FunkyBob> when I asked you to put {{ object.student_set.count }}  ... where did you put that?
[08:13:00] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/q6Pn
[08:13:03] <FunkyBob> i'm trying to establish that object is a thing in the context... hence the {{ object.teacher }} stuff
[08:13:14] <Steve-Dusty> why object.teacher?
[08:13:20] <Steve-Dusty> teacher is an attribute for class
[08:13:22] <FunkyBob> because it's a field on object
[08:13:23] <FunkyBob> yes
[08:13:32] <FunkyBob> that's the fucking thing I'm trying to get you to prove is in the context!Q
[08:13:51] <FunkyBob> since attempts to count related records are not even yielding a 0
[08:13:55] <FunkyBob> maybe object doesn'te xist
[08:13:59] <FunkyBob> 02:59 < FunkyBob> i'm trying to establish that object is a thing in the context... hence the {{ object.teacher }} stuff
[08:14:18] <Steve-Dusty> yes..
[08:14:18] <FunkyBob> so again
[08:14:26] <FunkyBob> where are you putting these?
[08:14:28] <FunkyBob> yes what?
[08:14:50] <Steve-Dusty> I'll try again tomorrow because i gtg now
[08:14:55] <Steve-Dusty> I'm sure it's just a dumb error
[08:15:09] <Steve-Dusty> and when I wake up it'll know what's wrong because refreshened mind
[08:15:25] <FunkyBob> don't give up now
[08:15:30] <FunkyBob> just a couple more steps
[08:15:33] <FunkyBob> if you'd just be clear
[08:15:35] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[08:15:43] <FunkyBob> you said "yes.." ... yes to what?
[08:15:47] <FunkyBob> because I have a lot of outstanding queries
[08:15:52] <FunkyBob> i don't know which you're responding to
[08:15:56] <Steve-Dusty> yes to it doesn't even go to 0
[08:16:16] <FunkyBob> ok, and all the other things I asked you to t est? and comment on?
[08:16:25] <Steve-Dusty> yes I commented out
[08:16:26] <Steve-Dusty> but ik the problem isn't the {{ student.SOMETHING }} part
[08:16:27] <FunkyBob> like... when you added {{ object.class_name }} ... where did you put it?
[08:16:36] <FunkyBob> bullshit you know that
[08:16:45] <Steve-Dusty> wait
[08:16:47] <FunkyBob> if there's not even a count of related rcords, that part of the template is never even reached
[08:16:58] <FunkyBob> so PROVE FIRST THAT OBJECT EXISTS in t he context
[08:17:01] <Steve-Dusty> if you're doing `{% for student in object.student_set.all %}`
[08:17:09] <Steve-Dusty> you're getitng the student model
[08:17:11] <Steve-Dusty> not the class model
[08:17:14] <FunkyBob> yes
[08:17:18] <Steve-Dusty> so why are you trying to reach for attributes inside the CLASS
[08:17:19] <FunkyBob> but i'm not interested in the loop yet
[08:17:21] <Steve-Dusty> such as class_name
[08:17:23] <Steve-Dusty> teacher
[08:17:24] <Steve-Dusty> etc
[08:17:25] <FunkyBob> because
[08:17:28] <FunkyBob> as I keep saying
[08:17:37] <FunkyBob> I'm trying to verify 'object' is in the context
[08:17:44] <Steve-Dusty> I tried that
[08:17:47] <FunkyBob> tried what?
[08:17:47] <Steve-Dusty> I did `student.class_name`
[08:17:53] <Steve-Dusty> and it still doesn't show
[08:17:55] <FunkyBob> well, that's fuicking onsense
[08:17:58] <FunkyBob> nonsense
[08:18:03] <FunkyBob> stop looking at t he student
[08:18:04] <Steve-Dusty> wait
[08:18:05] <Steve-Dusty> it showed
[08:18:11] <FunkyBob> fuck me
[08:18:20] <FunkyBob> if you'd just ansewr WHERE ARE YOU PUTTING THESE DEBUG LINES
[08:18:21] <Steve-Dusty> I figured that you wanted me to remove the for loop
[08:18:23] <FunkyBob> we might find what's wrong
[08:19:08] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/7ZZx
[08:19:08] <Steve-Dusty> Showed
[08:19:08] <FunkyBob> it's REALLY REALLY hard to help you when you won't give details
[08:19:08] <FunkyBob> and ignore questions
[08:19:08] <FunkyBob> ok... so {{ student.class_name }} should not show anything
[08:19:08] <FunkyBob> because there is nothing called 'student' in the context
[08:19:35] <FunkyBob> it should either be 'object' or 'class'... but class is... a problematic name
[08:19:59] <FunkyBob> so... replace student with object in that template, and try again
[08:20:14] <Steve-Dusty> same thing
[08:20:18] <FunkyBob> what?
[08:20:22] <Steve-Dusty> it showed "Steve"
[08:20:27] <Steve-Dusty> "Steve" is the name of my class
[08:20:30] <FunkyBob> ok

[08:20:39] <FunkyBob> but you're sayin student.class_name _also_ showed Steve?
[08:21:04] <FunkyBob> oh wait
[08:21:06] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[08:21:11] <FunkyBob> your ClassDetailView ... is on Students
[08:21:12] <FunkyBob> wat
[08:21:36] <FunkyBob> didn't we establish before you're trying to show a LIST of students in a specific class?
[08:21:49] <Steve-Dusty> YES
[08:22:06] <FunkyBob> so.... it should be model = Class
[08:22:12] <FunkyBob> so the view selects the specific class
[08:22:16] <FunkyBob> no wonder none of it made sense
[08:22:27] <Steve-Dusty> bruhhhhh first day of CBVs
[08:22:31] <FunkyBob> so what?
[08:22:35] <Steve-Dusty> Now I get it
[08:22:43] <Steve-Dusty> yes hardcore = best
[08:22:56] <hemebond> Quick couple of questions: 1. Do you know how to use Git? 2. is your code in a public repository?
[08:23:03] <FunkyBob> "I want to show details about a Class... so of course I'll query the Student model... WAT"
[08:23:48] <Steve-Dusty> hemebond yes of course
[08:23:52] <Steve-Dusty> 2. my code is in a public rep
[08:24:02] <Steve-Dusty> just search up https://github.com/Steve-Dusty
[08:24:03] <FunkyBob> hemebond: doesn't help much for spurious changes...
[08:24:12] <FunkyBob> you don't want to be commit+push every little debug attempt
[08:24:24] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[08:24:27] <Steve-Dusty> I haven't pushed yet
[08:24:30] <hemebond> Then can I suggest to create use PRs and point FunkyBob to it so they can see the exact state of your code at each stage?
[08:24:46] <hemebond> FunkyBob: Okay. Your call.
[08:25:01] <Steve-Dusty> I never used PRs on my own repo
[08:25:05] <Steve-Dusty> I just remember some commands and pull
[08:25:13] <Steve-Dusty> if merge conflict then reset --hard
[08:25:18] <FunkyBob> erk
[08:25:22] <Steve-Dusty> push*
[08:25:24] <FunkyBob> time to upskill your git :)
[08:25:29] <FunkyBob> branches are joy
[08:25:40] <Steve-Dusty> I have a frontend masters Git course

[12:38:48] <serafeim> hemebond: i'd like it yes. i did some trickery with initial values and it works now
[12:38:51] <hemebond> You shouldn't trust what the user sends through.
[12:39:32] <serafeim> hemebond: yes i know. but i guess sometimes you want a field to be readonly so that it could be changed through some javascript ; and you'll want to get that input in your form
[12:40:42] <hylje> widget readonly status is rendered in the form itself, and forms support such field attributes for user experience
[12:41:16] <hylje> you might want to include/exclude fields on the form class itself based on the criteria you want, or just omit fields entirely if you don't want them ever changed by the form
[12:54:08] <serafeim> yes i understand

[15:14:06] <relationalalgebr> Hi, is there a easy way to invalidate cache when a django admin model is changed? Say when a customer model is changed on admin panel, I need to call clear_cache(customer) function automatically. What would be the trivial way to achieve it?
[15:15:05] <GinFuyou> Only in admin panel?
[15:17:02] <relationalalgebr> Say I change the customer status to "inactive" though admin panel, I want some cache I set earlier to be invalidated. I have the function for invalidating cache but I need a way for it to be automatically called when I change the customer though admin panel
[15:17:36] <hylje> my hunch would be to find the ModelAdmin method that handles saving and override that
[15:18:33] <GinFuyou> save_model() iirc
[15:18:51] <GinFuyou> probably a few others may fit
[15:19:36] <GinFuyou> Admin has a relatively complex sequence to save m2m and formsets
[15:20:03] <hylje> but if you know your entry point you might be able to skip that

[19:04:11] <kezabelle> schinckel: keyset pagination? I wonder if it's a function of of expression affinity and everything being a bit stringy?
[19:17:48] <kezabelle> Someone rubber duck me. If timeit is fluctuating a bunch, likely because of living on a laptop and getting busy with "other shenanigans" or thottling or whatever. Upping the number of runs/iterations would probably amortize _some_ of that variance, right?

[19:29:53] <moldy> kezabelle: would that monotonic thingy help?
[19:30:47] <moldy> (time.monotonic())
[19:39:29] <kezabelle> moldy: I don't _think_ it'd be notably different than perf_counter which is AFAIK what timeit uses
[19:40:00] <kezabelle> could be wrong. may be worth trying anyway.
[19:40:19] <kezabelle> does introduce the possibility of getting the maths wrong compared to timeit though ;)
[19:43:47] <moldy> yup :)
[19:44:38] <kezabelle> maybe I should figure out why the tests are failing and then worry about how much more lightning fast I can go. But that's boring!

[23:22:23] *** Quits: Steve-Dusty (~Steve-Dus@user/steve-dusty) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[23:23:07] <hylje> leElvyn: foreign key fields will create a reverse accessor on the target model, by default called "<model>_set" where <model> is the model where the field is defined
[23:24:00] *** Joins: Steve-Dusty (~Steve-Dus@user/steve-dusty)
[23:24:34] <leElvyn> Is it the same for ManyToMany fields ?
[23:25:00] <hylje> yes
[23:25:14] <hylje> both sides of a m2m are like the receiving end of a foreignkey :-)
[23:25:44] <hylje> (in fact, there is normally an implicit intermediate model that has two foreignkeys, one to either end)
[23:26:46] <leElvyn> i see, thanks, so what happens if multiple objects are referring to the same one ?
[23:27:14] <leElvyn> multiple objects of the same model
[23:27:27] *** Joins: GinFuyou (~GinFuyou@reya.cloud.tilaa.com)
[23:27:41] <hylje> it's an accessor that works mostly like a model manager, so you can get all of them, or filter them, or do something queryset-ish to them
[23:27:53] <Steve-Dusty> how do you prefill models in django CBVs
[23:28:56] <leElvyn> amazing, thanks !
[23:31:10] <Steve-Dusty> what's the difference between success_url and get_absolute_url
[23:31:59] <hylje> success url is generally a view thing, some url where the redirect will go when the form is submitted correctly
[23:32:27] <hylje> get_absolute_url is generally a model thing, so you can ask a model for a link to the view that will show that model object
[23:33:32] <Steve-Dusty> so should I use success_url or get_absolute_url

[23:41:42] <hylje> there are various options, like simply using a template to manually define the HTML exactly as you want it, iterating the form and rendering some or all the fields manually, using a form formatting library...
[23:42:04] <kezabelle> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/#rendering-fields-manually
[23:42:37] <hylje> unless you have some very peculiar needs, i find quite basic form rendering and judicious application of CSS classes go a long way
[23:43:21] <Steve-Dusty> I need welpo
[23:43:35] <Steve-Dusty> Uhh so 'auth.User' in model foreignkey user field
[23:43:41] <Steve-Dusty> I want to prefill it in CBVs
[23:43:53] <Steve-Dusty> I don't want users to have to input who they are
[23:44:04] <Steve-Dusty> it'd automatically input if they're logged in. how do I do that?
[23:44:18] <kezabelle> either use initial data for the form or ... don't include that field at all, if you know who they are.
[23:44:39] <hylje> you specifically don't want it anywhere near a form, you take the incomplete model object from the form and stick the currently logged in user there before saving for real
[23:44:49] <Steve-Dusty> yes... but when I take it out it errors
[23:44:55] <kezabelle> IIRC the method on a CBV of the right type is get_initial
[23:44:55] <Steve-Dusty> i take it out from "fields = []"
[23:45:09] <Steve-Dusty> it said I didn't input anything..
