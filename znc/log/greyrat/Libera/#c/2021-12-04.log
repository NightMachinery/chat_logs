[00:40:39] <Kit> on that note, is it worth it to use a string buffer before writing to a file instead of writing it directly with fprintf line by line
[00:40:53] <ioxzev1z> Kit, elaborate?
[00:40:55] <Kit> say theres 10 lines to write
[00:41:09] <Kit> currently im writing each line with fprintf
[00:41:30] <Kit> but each line is written individually
[00:41:45] <Kit> would it be worth it to use a buffer then write the buffer to disk
[00:41:58] <ioxzev1z> I doubt that you need to optimize 10 fprintf calls
[00:41:59] <Kit> or is it okay to call fprintf 10 times
[00:42:14] <Kit> im more concerned about disk wear
[00:42:43] <Kit> would that automatically be optimized out with the compiler/os
[00:43:08] <ioxzev1z> I doubt you can affect disk wear via fprintf. Might be that all 10 fprintf calls are buffered before the actual print happens
[00:43:28] <Kit> okay, cool
[00:43:29] <Kit> thanks

[03:03:36] <phryk> I'm currently trying to manually parse PNG, all works well except for the last chunk (the IEND one) which is read twice. I'm always acting on the same FILE * and do all my reads with fread. Now I'm hella confused, because far as I can tell from the docs, this behavior should be impossible…
[03:03:53] <quartz> I suppose the descriptor has output enough lines that, when it gets to the while loop at 99, it fputc reads only the actual file data
[03:04:29] <twkm> phryk: sounds like you are using feof wrongly, e.g., while (!feof(stream)) ...
[03:04:31] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)
[03:05:21] <phryk> twkm: but with fread advanding the position indicator, fread just just return 0 and write 0 bytes into the passed buffer, shouldn't it?

[03:06:09] <phryk> Also, I'm really not sure !feof would work, as a non-zero value indicates EOF
[03:06:50] <twkm> i showed how it might be used wrongly.  also feof isn't predictive, it is reactive.
[03:07:00] <phryk> far as I understand !feof would do the opposite. But since it's only defined as "non-zero" I'm also not sure i can just do if(feof(stream)) because I kinda assume something like -1 would be interpreted as false but would indicated EOF

[03:10:45] <twkm> feof is almost always wrong.
[03:10:59] <phryk> twkm: I don't and I'm not sure I'm allowed to show you my admittedly subpar code… :/
[03:11:45] <phryk> But going back to the beginning… What happens if the position indicator is at the end of the file and I call feof?
[03:12:01] <twkm> the write a an all new program, the test case, that isn't directly what you will turn in.
[03:12:02] <fizzie> Depends on whether you've tried to read past it yet or not.
[03:12:11] <phryk> Like I could understand if it jumped back to the beginning or a random place, but it always jumps back to the beginning of the last chunk…
[03:12:50] <fizzie> `feof` does _not_ test whether the position indicator is at the end, it tests whether an end-of-file condition has been set on a stream. And the end-of-file condition is only set once an attempt to read past the end has failed.
[03:12:56] <fizzie> ,faq feof
[03:12:57] <candide> http://c-faq.com/stdio/feof.html - 12. Stdio, 12.2: Why does the simple line-copying loop while(!feof(infp)) { fgets(buf, MAXLINE, infp); fputs(buf, outfp); } copy the last line twice?
[03:12:58] <phryk> fizzie: I mean the position indicator is at the end of the file and *then* I call fread, i.e. this would be the call that "overshoots"
[03:13:14] <phryk> fizzie: Oh, that might explain things.
[03:13:20] <fizzie> ^ that FAQ entry explains the most typical case of using feof wrong.
[03:13:56] <phryk> oh yes, that seems exactly my problem, thanks candide. :)
[03:14:28] <phryk> so, is there an actual good way to check whether the position indicator arrived at the end of the file or do I *have* to overshoot the file to even find out?
[03:14:40] <twkm> check fread's return value.
[03:15:27] <phryk> twkm: i have been told that short reads are not guaranteed to be caused by reaching the end of the file but can also happen in the middle, so that doesn't seem like a strong indicator…
[03:15:40] <phryk> (told by someone with boatloads more C experience than myself)
[03:16:32] <twkm> short reads only happen because of eof or error.
[03:16:39] <twkm> (for files)
[03:17:11] <twkm> on a unix-ish system you might experience short reads if you are reading a file that's still being created.
[03:17:11] <phryk> twkm: files as opposed to "files" like in /dev?
[03:18:56] <fizzie> If you want to cater for things like pipes, you use a return value of 0 from fread as a signal for EOF.
[03:19:33] <twkm> any thing that isn't a "plain" file, e.g., block or character special files, named pipes, domain sockets, etc.
[03:19:43] <phryk> twkm: and in the case of the file still being created it would not be recognized as EOF or error?

[05:45:12] <nitrix> vim_fans, Similarly, pointer values (addresses) have representations, but not every representations are valid, so you can't just create values out of thin air.
[05:45:52] <nitrix> vim_fans, A better example of this would be, `bool` which only supports the values `0` and `1`, despite it being at least as large as a byte. What are the other bits for?
[05:46:08] <caze> vim_fans: Better example: int arr[2][3] = { { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 } }; int *p = &arr[0][3]; this is allowed, but then doing *p = 42; is not.
[05:46:40] <vim_fans> nitrix: I had been told that two pointers can operate subtraction only if they point to the same array.what's going on with my test. please check it out.https://pastebin.com/MBznMJgq
[05:46:46] <twkm> when you can create pointer values at will the results won't be widely portable -- only narrowly.
[05:46:49] <caze> Or even doing int t = *p;
[05:47:36] <nitrix> vim_fans, That's very true. Consider the case where pointers are UUID generated by a database when you store data in it.
[05:47:54] <caze> Even if you can prove that p must point to arr[1][0], you still cannot access that memory, whether for read or write.
[05:48:40] <vim_fans> why this statement p = q-p is not correct in my url example?
[05:48:40] <nitrix> vim_fans, Are you starting to see that subtracting two completely unrelated UUIDs would make no sense? The database would only know how to calculate the "difference", if it also knows what the UUIDs represent.
[05:49:32] <nitrix> Checking your code.
[05:49:58] <caze> vim_fans: Subtracting a pointer from another pointer gives you a pointer?
[05:50:26] <nitrix> In that example, `q` and `p` do belong to the same array though.
[05:50:48] <nitrix> The result would not be a pointer though.
[05:50:55] <caze> But he's trying to assign the result to a pointer.
[05:51:21] <nitrix> Mhm. That part's wrong. And the printf later doesn't make sense either.
[05:51:43] <vim_fans> caze: doesn't pointer is the address? the result of subtraction still is an address?
[05:51:52] <caze> vim_fans: No.
[05:52:35] <caze> vim_fans: p + 2 is q, do you agree?
[05:53:04] <vim_fans> caze: yeah i am agree with it 
[05:53:18] <vim_fans> *(p+2)
[05:53:33] <nitrix> He's asking you to do algebra. Forget C for a second.
[05:53:41] <caze> vim_fans: p + 2 = q <==> p = q - 2 <==> q - p = 2
[05:54:22] <vim_fans> caze: yeah I got it now. I totally understand it by your algebra
[05:54:47] <danielcamiel> q-p
[05:54:48] <danielcamiel> 'U'
[05:55:32] <nitrix> Pointer arithmetic works in a similar way. Pointer + integer = pointer. Pointer - integer = pointer. Pointer - pointer = integer.
[05:56:03] <caze> vim_fans: What is pointer * pointer?
[05:56:45] <vim_fans> caze:  the address of the pointer?
[05:57:07] <NRK[m]> x_x
[05:57:37] <NRK[m]> is multiplying pointers even allowed?
[05:57:38] <caze> vim_fans: It's not defined, and the operation is a syntax error.
[05:57:44] <twkm> a constraint violation.  one cannot meaningfully multiply p by q.
[05:59:09] <nitrix> This highlights an important aspect of pointers. Pointers aren't integers. The arithmetic that you do with the + and - operators are special to pointers and mean something completely different than for integers.
[05:59:11] <vim_fans> caze: sorry i thought it was assignment statement. multiply is not allowed between pointers. right?
[05:59:55] <caze> vim_fans: Correct.

[06:01:18] <vim_fans> nitrix: when + and - operator with pointer , it would add or sub multiple bytes.But in integer case, it just add or sub one
[06:02:29] <nitrix> vim_fans, If you print the pointer with %p you'd see the address increase by the size of the type that the pointer points at, yes, but it's still not a good idea to learn of them as numbers, even though in practice they are.
[06:03:14] <pragma-> vim_fans: no, pointer arithmetic works with the sizes of the pointer type
[06:03:34] <nitrix> It's better to think of them as handles/descriptors. Only the implementation knows what the difference between two handles means.
[06:03:45] <nitrix> And only if the handles happens to refer to the same object will it know.
[06:04:52] <nitrix> So all you have are handles, and sometimes offsets (difference between handles, or that you add to handles).

[10:46:24] <vim_fans> hi,there. If i assign an array to a pointer,then the pointer would point to the first element of that array.But when you printf("%s ",p) it would automatically marched along the array?I mean that i don't need to write loop to print it out

[12:59:21] <QMaury> can anyone link some learning resources? (other than K&R)
[12:59:29] <veltas> I guess we're moral support in here too
[12:59:53] <QMaury> eh just ran out of ideas i guess
[13:00:06] <veltas> Don't be discouraged if you find K&R hard, what is hard about it?
[13:00:13] <veltas> Some of the exercises are indeed hard
[13:00:29] <veltas> And the terminology they use might be a bit unfamliar if you're used to newer languages
[13:01:18] <QMaury> i think the K&R is fine for the most part, I just think that I need some more 'modern' resources
[13:01:39] <veltas> The C primer is often recommended
[13:02:21] <veltas> I think it has at least C99 stuff?
[13:02:59] <QMaury> hmm i've never heard of it

[13:03:54] <QMaury> yea
[13:04:17] <veltas> But I will say I don't think you need a more modern resource. I could be wrong but C hasn't changed much in practice since K&R, and you can always learn new syntax/features separately

[13:14:54] <quartz> pehaef: I really only need the buffer to read in a simple HTTP reply from a server
[13:15:04] <quartz> But I get your point
[13:16:34] <pehaef> an answer I respect tends to be "well, there's no useful standard for a max so I have to pick one if I don't want to go nuts; I picked 1000 because when I tested it I rarely saw anything over 200 bytes, so with a safety margin... and besides, I guard against overflow so the worst thing that will happen is SORRY CAN'T READ THAT so we're good"

[21:31:14] <dave0> halabund: could even use an array   int vector[large][2];
[21:32:48] <halabund> What I mean is that it is well known that if a square matrix is stored in row-wise order, iterating it through by rows is faster than doing it by columns. This is due to caching effects.
[21:33:14] <halabund> Now suppose the matrix is n-by-2, and iteration is row-wise. Is there a benefit to storing it row-wise vs column-wise?
[21:33:46] <dave0> keeping things close together is usually a win
[21:34:00] <halabund> The difference to the n-by-n case is that now we deal with two columns only. Can the CPU cache two separate memory regions at the same time?
[21:34:59] <halabund> I wrote a test program where I iterate through one long vector vs iterating through two half-size vectors concurrently. If optimization is turned off, the latter is 2x faster (surprisingly). With optimization, the timings are identical. 
[21:35:11] <halabund> This I'm not sure if in this case it really helps to keep things closer.
[21:35:35] <halabund> But I don't think my naive benchmarks is representative of all real-world scenarios ... that's why I'm asking here

[23:08:31] <fizzie> Obligatory warning that there's two different things "in which order which operation is performed" might mean, and the one answered by ,paren / ,prec (which expressions are operands of which operators) does not generally relate to the other (order in which expressions are evaluated).
[23:08:35] <fizzie> ,cc int f(void) { puts("f"); return 2; } int g(void) { puts("g"); return 3; } int h(void) { puts("h"); return 5; }  printf("%d", f()+g()*h());
[23:08:37] <candide> fizzie: f g h 17
[23:09:24] <fizzie> The multiplication is "done first" (as in, the value calculated is 2+(3*5)), but in that particular instance the function f() was called first.

[23:34:32] <cousteau> fizzie: anyway, thanks for that example; I could've used one of those (stupid f() + g() would always respect the order)
[23:35:12] <cousteau> then again, I think what they were claiming was that a+b always evaluated the operands from left to right
