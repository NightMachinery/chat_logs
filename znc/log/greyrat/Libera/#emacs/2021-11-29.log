[00:02:12] <krux02> wasamasa, no the problem is, I don't know if the file has too long lines before I open in. By default I open it in emacs and emacs just freezes and I can't go back.

[00:02:47] <krux02> So in a context where I might encounter files with long lines that would render emacs completely useless. And I suggest that should be fixed.

[01:36:53] <libertyprime> i think pen.el is the *only* prompt engineering IDE that is fully transparent. other SAAS including vscode completely obscure the prompt engineering. in fact, the situation is worse (much more progressed) than that. continuous prompts (aka. soft prompts) are eliminating prompt engineering and prompts are an unintelligible string of bytes.

[02:07:57] <veracioux> Hi, when I fold a block of code (e.g. a function) using hs-toggle-hiding, the cursor ends up inside the collapsed ... placeholder, which is expected. But when I run hs-toggle-hiding again it doesn't unfold. I have to move left by one character so that the cursor is on the function declaration. This is quite irritating. Is there a way to fix this? I'm using spacemacs btw.

[06:12:52] <homerj> I never had to do anything special for syntax highlighting though

[06:23:33] <TDT> I'll have to read up on what that start-server part does.  Added that to the list, I had a similar block for the program-selection, but added the server start to it.  The revert, I tested without and it looks like eaf is doing the revert automatically, so it's a live update.
[06:23:59] <homerj> that or if I input something with a whole bunch of goofy tags in jabref, see if the bibliography is going to look goofy
[06:24:01] <TDT> One thing I had issues with was trying to 'view' the PDF, but noticed it under C-c C-c this time, as 'view', and that worked.
[06:25:07] <TDT> I need to mess with .bib files and all that sometime.  Out of the years I've used latex in a light capacity, I haven't dipped into those waters yet.
[06:25:40] <homerj> it's a lot of personal preference in that kind of stuff, but I like jabref
[06:25:46] <homerj> because it uses .bib as its native format
[06:25:53] <TDT> One thing that inspired me on this presentation setup today was the idea of "living in emacs", which, trying to find ways of using it more than I have been.  There'll be limitations due to my security setup, but I should be able to get a lot in emacs.
[06:26:17] <homerj> funny part, is I use emacs for a lot of things, except for coding
[06:26:54] <TDT> I've primarily used it for org-mode on this end.  Some simple file edits, and org mode.  That was really it.  Coding done in other IDEs, etc.
[06:27:20] <homerj> yes, I have all my work stuff in org-mode
[06:27:31] <TDT> Started more this weekend bringing my GTD system back into emacs, over using Open Project for my task management.

[06:30:20] <TDT> Due to security constraints, it's unlikely I'll fully be able to live in emacs like others here can :)  But, maybe can get a bit closer.  Org-roam really brought me into using emacs more, and the conference is helping with more of that.
[06:33:40] <homerj> one thing I used to do, was I had Samsung Notes set up with Tasker, so I could take my tablet to a meeting, write stuff down, then it would convert it all into text and I'd put it into org-mode
[06:33:49] <homerj> back in the "before times"

[07:54:58] <twb> pingpongball: "jit-lock" is syntax highlighting ("font locking")
[07:54:59] <neeasade> pingpongball: default modeline is still a modeline -- I meant to expand the cpu report. FWIW here is a list of things that I found slowing me down while profiling junk: https://notes.neeasade.net/annoying-org-typing-slowdowns.html (most of these are known)

[17:41:15] <grym> and, well, the positivists got blown up pretty hard because it turns out you can't do that 
[17:41:43] <taeaad> Though in a realistic sense, types in computer science are each finite sets. Integers for example could be the set with 1028 elements if you have some hipster tiny data type. But this is not useful unless you have more structure to tell you what you can do with the type. So set theory needs to encode things like functions (R, (X, Y) for the function f: X -> Y with graph R.

[17:42:52] <taeaad> In any case, my point is just that you don't need mathematical type theory for types in computer science, as far as I can tell.
[17:43:00] <rpav> but for example we can talk about pi _in the abstract_, and define it, and obviously, to that extent it "exists," but without infinite capacity in some regard the _infinite extent_ of pi doesn't "exist"
[17:43:19] <grym> taeaad: as far as i've been told (since i'm really a bystander here), there's more or less no difference between the two types of types
[17:43:21] <taeaad> You can just shove everything into finite sets.

But I suppose you can avoid set theory from the outset and start with type theory. But that would be the domain of a type theorist.

[17:48:01] <taeaad> aniketgm: It was because type theory can be seen as studying types such as int, boolean, float, etc but can also be a solution to paradoxes with large sets. The former is type theory applied to computer science and the latter is usually just called type theory.

[22:03:01] <ldlework> junebug: my gut instinct is "not easily"
[22:03:21] <corwin> we call emacs "extensions" as "packages", and it's pretty easy to get started with

[22:03:35] <pjb> junebug: nothing batteries included.
[22:03:39] <junebug> I can try elisp. Can you recommend some learning materials?
[22:04:06] <pjb> junebug: before lexical bindings was introduced, there was an emacs-cl CL implementation written in emacs lisp, which would let you write emacs extensions in Common Lisp.
[22:04:22] <ldlework> junebug: (func-name 5 "10" (other-func t))
[22:04:23] <pjb> junebug: there may be other language implementions in emacs lisp, but I don't have a current list.

[22:05:12] <pjb> junebug: nowadays, emac has modules (plug-ins), so it's theorically possible to link eg. libecl.so into emacs, and use Common Lisp, from emacs, but you'd need to add code to easily call emacs stuff from CL.
[22:05:22] <ldlework> junebug: that's just a matter of importing some other lib and calling its functions

[23:46:35] <rpav> part of it is you really don't _need_ GC for a lot of things, and it can add some unnecessary complexity to your code .. other times it can remove a lot of unnecessary complexity, so it all depends

[23:47:56] <technomancy> I wrote a program whose GC strategy is "just reset the heap pointer back to where it started every time you run thru the main loop"

[23:48:22] <rpav> "dump everything every frame" is definitely a useful strategy
