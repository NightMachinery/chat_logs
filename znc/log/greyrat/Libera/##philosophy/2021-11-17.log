[00:54:55] <kmh> audrey,  are you in russia right now?
[00:55:10] <audrey> kmh: No, sadly.\ (I¬¥d like to be.)

[00:55:54] <audrey> But yeah, was rather surprised to see RT doing a more or less even-handed interview.

[00:58:15] <kmh> basically western leftish critics to which RT offers a platform
[00:58:38] <audrey> It¬¥s not a good look when I have to go to Sky News, RT, and National Review to get coverage of certain issues.
