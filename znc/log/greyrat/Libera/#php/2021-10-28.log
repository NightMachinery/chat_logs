[01:24:43] <Blondie101010> based on their example and traces, the try-catch would be outside the function
[01:28:50] <__adrian> lembron: you shouldn't need to use call_user_func() at all.  $f(...$args)  covers all of it as we discovered yesterday.
[01:29:23] <Sammitch> but what if I need to run PHP 5.1 at some point?
[01:29:23] <__adrian> "array($mysqli, 'fetch_assoc')(null)"  fetch_assoc is a method on mysqli_result, not on mysqli
[01:29:37] <__adrian> if maybe that's your issue
[01:29:59] <__adrian> also why pass  null ?
[01:36:14] <lembron> __adrian im forced to lint down to 5.4 till 2022 :/
[01:37:11] <__adrian> it's not all practical to do so with a single codebase
[01:37:34] <lembron> and na, the  "array($mysqli, 'fetch_assoc')(null)"  shall turn into  "$mysqli->fetch_assoc()" so thats fine from what i want, just not phpÂ´s end :P

[07:03:10] <__adrian> don't store the clear password anywhere  ;)
[07:03:25] <Nekomander> dag, I believe the password stuff should be in a separate class, or modular, because HOW TO AUTHENTICATE is separate from just owning and maintaining user account. What I am saying is, what about a non password approach such as using 2FA/U2F?
[07:03:52] <__adrian> what identifies the account?
[07:04:25] <Nekomander> Then password hashes changes as standards change. In the past, people used MD5, then switched over to SHA1 and so on.
[07:04:29] <dag> yeah i didnt think of that. could possibly have accounts without password. the $id identifies the account
[07:04:51] <Nekomander> identity and authentication is different :D
[07:05:06] <__adrian> well, i meant from the user's perspective. is the username or email unique? or do users need to memorize their id?
[07:06:42] <dag> both are unique so both can identify the account

I think it's a problem accessing the pdf file, which is in the same directory as the script, but I'm not sure.  it doesn't show the error, just stops executing on the line that reads the file.  I tried turning errors back on once a while ago and failed.  how do I find out why it's not working?
[07:39:36] <__adrian> !+error logging
[07:39:36] <php-bot> In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[07:41:40] <fluffywolf> "less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors" yeah, that's where I failed last time I tried seeing errors.
[07:41:41] <fluffywolf> lol
[07:41:58] <__adrian> :)

[07:53:44] <fluffywolf> yes
[07:54:05] <__adrian> seems pretty out of date
[07:54:32] <Nekomander> dag, I forgot to mention. You can set this up in PHP https://github.com/lbuchs/WebAuthn - Then use the web browser plugin to test it. - You can further test it by purchasing and using one of the FIDO2 Hardware.
[07:54:38] <fluffywolf> it has current committs, but it doesn't seem to work very well.
[07:54:45] <__adrian> wow. maintained  .__Â·
[07:55:48] <Nekomander> https://github.com/web-auth/webauthn-lib exists too.

[07:57:49] <fluffywolf> ok, giving up on it.  oh well.  I was hoping to avoid forking a cli utility and parsing what it spits out, but pdfparser is not useful.
[07:57:54] <fluffywolf> thanks for the pointers on error reporting!
[07:58:02] <__adrian> np
[07:58:22] <__adrian> i haven't done pdf parsing recently but there are other libraries you might look at
[07:59:55] <fluffywolf> I didn't find any...
[08:00:27] <__adrian> https://packagist.org/?query=pdf
[08:01:28] <fluffywolf> those are all for generation, except for the one that pdfparser is based on.  lol
[08:03:13] <fluffywolf> found one in there that's a wrapper for the poppler cli utils like I was going to do, but I think it doesn't have enough options.
[08:03:36] <__adrian> also some in there that wrap pdftk
[08:04:19] <__adrian> though don't know what you actually need to do
[08:08:45] <fluffywolf> take a pdf file containing daily delivery information for the company I work for and extract addresses, tracking numbers, etc, in a useful format.
[08:09:12] <fluffywolf> the corporate software won't provide this list in any format other than printing from their webapp, and the file is the result of printing it to pdf.
[08:10:00] <fluffywolf> pdfparser generates letter soup from the file, while poppler's utils generate complete strings.

[14:18:40] <Nekomander> Yeah, I heard of this idea being floated around, but I think they might as well fork or something. Depending on how much the code should deviate that is.
[14:19:52] <Nekomander> I wish we would get property accessors, it just keeps getting rejected each and every single time -.-
[14:21:10] <Nekomander> If a new language were to be made, I hope they will perish the thought of making it "noob friendly".
[14:22:12] <TinoDidriksen> We really don't need more new languages.
[14:22:15] <Nekomander> I believe that any programming language (the ones that we have right now) can be noob friendly, as long as the rules of how the language is written and so on is properly explained.
[14:23:08] <Nekomander> People just think "AHHHH NEW FEATURES! SCARY!" then it just never gets added to the language.
[14:23:30] <stenno> i fixed my 2.7 update issue, thanks everyone who helped me
[14:23:33] <Nekomander> TinoDidriksen, well, I believe if it can be pulled off in a desirable way, then by all means, let's go for it!
[14:23:52] <stenno> i updated composer to 2.0, which did _not_ break my app, and removed some exotic packages
[14:24:05] <stenno> updated, then added the packages again
[14:24:07] <stenno> huzzah
[14:24:28] <stenno> i think it was the hint of upgrading composer that did it, thanks to whoever gave me that tip
[14:24:41] <TinoDidriksen> I don't think it's necessary. Opt-in sanity features such as strict_types will do fine. That way code can be upgraded piecemeal, pushed by linters.
[14:26:24] <Nekomander> I like how python handles importing functions from other .py files a lot better.

[17:31:54] <kittonian> hi all. i'm having a strange issue where I can connect to a remote mysql db with user, password, dbname, etc. through php and get a connection successful message, but I cannot return any data from a simple select statement
[17:32:26] <Naktibalda> kittonian: how simple?
[17:32:43] <kittonian> like literally select user_login from tablename;
[17:33:04] <kittonian> i can run the statement just fine from within the mysql interface as the user
[17:33:05] <Naktibalda> if the table is large, add LIMIT 1
[17:33:10] <kittonian> no, it's 1 row
[17:33:21] <kittonian> it returns nothing
[17:34:06] <biberu> Naktibalda: that page requires agreement to stuff before seeing the contents, what does it say?

[17:41:23] <kittonian> i am trying
[17:53:27] <kittonian> it's all working again (no data but connection successful). the no data issue is due to a php error in the script

[22:13:11] <Albright> I confess I don't really understand it, but I haven't really tried. Unix permissions work well enough for me.

[22:13:29] <Albright> Yeah, isn't the whole point of containers making dev and prod environments more similar?

[23:01:16] <zerosum> hey all, I was here yesterday w/ some question regarding a php script I have that basically sends an email using the Symfony Mailer library.. I went ahead and removed the captcha and added some exception handling as suggested but I still get no output or errors when I simply just run it inline with php myscript.php .. is there something I missed?
[23:01:16] <zerosum> here's what it looks like now: https://bpa.st/DFPQ
[23:01:56] <zerosum> appreciate any feedback
[23:03:11] <forgotmynick> i notice that when a returned variable is only used once, many code snippets store it in a variable - e.g. https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/124106 [ `$blog_id = get_current_blog_id(); if ( 1 == $blog_id ) { ...` ] - why is this? if the value is only used once why not just do `if ( get_current_blog_id() == 1 ) { ...` ? it's not limited to wordpress but in general
[23:04:24] <AllenJB> zerosum: What transport are you using (what's before the :// on your DSN)?
[23:06:29] <zerosum> AllenJB: I've tried several but rn I'm going with the mailjet transport, so it looks smth like this: mailjet+smtp://user:key@default
[23:07:12] <zerosum> and I'm setting it as env variable with just doing an export $MAILER_DSN

[23:13:20] <AllenJB> zerosum: hmm... I would definitely expect an error if the mail failed to sent when using SMTP )as opposed to using sendmail where the message might drop into a queue and any errors only show in the mail server log). Does MailJet provide any kind of log of sent messages you can check?
[23:15:30] <zerosum> AllenJB: it kinda does with a dashboard that looks like this: https://www.evernote.com/l/Arnj9NEnw9lIbJ3VbUa-o8y-OlcuJxJI3tg

[23:19:49] <AllenJB> zerosum: Is what you pastebin'd the entire script? Or how does MailerController->sendEmail get called? According to the pastebin you die() after defining the class but nothing ever instantiates or calls it
[23:21:37] <Sammitch> forgotmynick: six of one, half dozen of the other.
[23:22:04] <zerosum> AllenJB that's a great point, yes that's the entire script.. what I did was just copy and paste from their docs here: https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#creating-sending-messages
[23:22:30] <forgotmynick> Sammitch: pardon?
[23:23:27] <zerosum> AllenJB so I think you may be right, I don't call it anywhere so that's why it doesn't show naything

[23:24:06] <zerosum> wow..

[23:26:39] <BadAdviceCat> zerosum, the reason for that is explained in here: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php - Just after the first note.
[23:26:41] <Blondie101010> if you want the sendEmail() function out of the class, just move it out
[23:28:23] <zerosum> Blondie101010 hmm like this? https://bpa.st/2A7Q
[23:29:01] <Blondie101010> your line 16 is very confusing
[23:29:17] <Blondie101010> but nothing will be run after that
[23:29:41] <Blondie101010> it looks like you copy pasted 2-3 things almost blindly
[23:31:35] <AllenJB> 16-22 look like (Container) configuration that's meant to be in a separate file to me. I don't know Symfony so don't know the best way to set up symfony/mailer when not using a Symfony app.  Looking at the code there appears to be a Transport::fromDsn() method you might be able to use.
[23:32:43] <Blondie101010> the documentation example copied ( https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html ) is for a properly set up app
[23:32:56] <AllenJB> There's an example on the library Readme: https://github.com/symfony/mailer#getting-started
[23:33:11] <Blondie101010> nice
[23:33:21] <AllenJB> that might be better to follow when not using a full app
