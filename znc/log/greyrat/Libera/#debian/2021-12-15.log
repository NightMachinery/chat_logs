[03:43:31] <somiaj> Endermen1094: what version of debian are you running? Usually os-prober can detect this, but you can also manually add entries by using /etc/grub.d/, look at /etc/grub.d/40_custom or 41_custom

[03:43:56] <Endermen1094>  
[03:44:17] <somiaj> Endermen1094: Then os-prober should detect this, but depending on your setup, writing a custom hook would be better.
[03:44:56] <somiaj> arkanoid: Ahh yea. Could just be a typo in the manual page where the author is just use to adding that flag. It doesn't do any harm, but might not be needed for a binary only build (from what I see)

[03:48:11] <somiaj> arkanoid: I personaly use dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b to build some packages from a git tree. So -i isn't needed for binary only.

[03:48:54] <arkanoid> somiaj: it's first time I build a package, so I had to ask
[03:49:41] <somiaj> Reasonable. I don't know if it is worth filing a minor bug against devscripts to point out the manual page has an uneeded option (But I also don't know enough to be positive, but it does appear to be only useful for dpkg-source)
[03:49:45] <arkanoid> quick question, if I download a the src package and run "debuild -us -uc -b", is it assured I get the same version that would be installed via the binary package?
[03:50:29] <somiaj> arkanoid: Depends on your build enviorment and linked binaries. In theory if you use a clean chroot the most builds are reproduciable.
[03:50:43] <Endermen1094> https://paste.debian.net/1223492/ is the output of update-grub

[03:51:41] <Endermen1094> it duesn't show up when rebooting into grub
[03:51:56] <arkanoid> maybe is debuild chrooting on it's own?
[03:51:58] <sney> if you're going to be building packages a lot, you may want to use pbuilder or cowbuilder in order to use a clean chroot every time
[03:52:04] <somiaj> arkanoid: And you don't have any locally installed build deps getting int he way? Anyways, it should be the same, but there are reasons it could be different.
[03:52:08] <sney> debuild does not chroot by itself
[03:52:45] <somiaj> or if you want to manually do it, just use debootstrap to create a chroot and do the build in there.

[03:54:50] <arkanoid> sure, I can understand. I'm quite a fan of nixos and reproducible builds. But debian is my comfort zone
[03:55:34] <somiaj> Using a clean chroot should create reproducible builds, you can manually create one or use pbuilder/cowbuild/sbuild to automate it
[03:56:05] <PerfDave> Assuming the package is (a) capable of and (b) configured to be built reproducibly, which isn't always the case :)
[03:56:45] <somiaj> yea, I should have said, 'most' and it keeps getting better

[04:38:29] <noord> sney: is dpkgbot source public?
[04:40:03] <n4dir> cow_2001: also perhaps you find some useful info or help-options here: https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/PythonTeam
[04:40:33] <somiaj> noord: You want the source or the factoid database
[04:40:45] <n4dir> mainly the FAQ sounds like it might be useful, though i'd probably give the IRC channel or the mailing list a try too (what do they recommend)
[04:40:56] <noord> source
[04:41:15] <somiaj> noord: I don't know if the source is fully public, it is based off of infobot, which source is public, but it has been modified
[04:41:39] <somiaj> https://wiki.debian.org/IRC/DpkgBot
[04:42:22] <somiaj> http://www.infobot.org/ -- you can get the source there, though not quite sure exactly what version dpkg runs or how many customizations have been added
[04:42:33] <somiaj> !about
[04:42:33] <dpkg> Enter /msg dpkg help in your IRC client, or http://www.debian.org/intro/about
[04:42:43] <somiaj> wrong factoid, nevermind
[04:43:40] <noord> somiaj: it is not big deal, I will implement an irc bridge, just getting ideas
[04:43:45] <noord> thanks
[04:44:09] <somiaj> Note if you are wanting irc bots, there are far more modern options out there than infobot, dpkg is a dinousaur

[05:08:44] <gh555222> I also tried burning a bootable image to a hard disk, and connecting it to the internal sata controller (non-usb) and was still getting an error that 'no bootable medium found'
[05:09:25] <gh555222> oh absolutely, if I was still in front of that computer, the process of troubleshooting would be much more easily performed
[05:09:45] <Blondie101010> the first one might be a bug, that justifies some troubleshooting, but this last thing you said means you don't know how to install an OS besides Windows

[05:10:44] <gh555222> usb 2-3: device descriptor read/64, error -110
[05:10:57] <somiaj> that could also just be a bad usb controler.

[05:12:44] <Blondie101010> 110 is a timeout...  so you were able to boot the machine with a usb drive?

[05:19:04] <somiaj> de-facto: most should come with the binary package.

[12:03:35] <idioterna> your best bet is to tail logs in /var/log/cups to see what's going on, and i usually have to authenticate to cups as root if i want it to perform anything useful

[14:35:05] <pingpongball> oh , i installed gnome
[14:35:07] <Khepra> that depends on hardware
[14:35:11] <pingpongball> i mean flashing gnome
[14:35:20] <Khepra> modern hardware can equally well run any DE or WM, performance is not an issue
[14:35:50] <Khepra> if you're constrained with RAM, or don't have capable GPU, then GNOME (that _requires_ GPU acceleration) might not be the best choice
[14:36:12] <pingpongball> any other , like in emacs , to make emacs fast i had to use "--native compilation"  when compiling, it became lightening fast,

[14:36:30] <pingpongball> oh i've a old gpu on laptop.
[14:36:32] <Khepra> (but that's, like, many years old potatoes of "intel" persuasion, think older than haswell and stuff with less than 4GB of RAMs)
[14:37:21] <randall> pingpongball: If you intend on recompiling everything, Debian is the wrong distro for you.
[14:37:37] <pingpongball> no no i've more chores to do in life , but
[14:37:37] <Khepra> pingpongball: not sure if you're joking ("still compilin' meme"), but if you're serious then no, recompiling with -march=native won't give you significant or even perceived speed improvement EXCEPT in special (multimedia mostly) libs that do benefit from modern SIMD and otehr extensions
[14:37:44] <Haohmaru> even if i have a supercomputer, in my book, it's just plain wrong to use a webbrowser to make a GUI for a calculator app

[14:40:46] <Khepra> Haohmaru: web browsers are the magickal "fifteenth standard" that seems to actually work. in fact, more precisely, it's using a markup language and a cascading stylesheet, to build UIs, that apparently works awesomely well, and is ubiquitous and platform agnostic.

[14:41:20] <Khepra> so that's the only reasonable thing to do.   the actual complaint is in embedding whole chrome micro-OS into each such applilcation but THAT is orthogonal to using a markup language, and cascading stylesheets, to build an UI.
[14:41:32] <Haohmaru> doesn't mean it's "right"

[14:45:22] <Khepra> you said it was wrong to use a webbrowser to make a GUI, which implies you're complaining against html+css
[14:45:36] *** Joins: Forza (~Forza@user/forza)
[14:46:00] <Khepra> because one can have ONE instance of a webbrowsers and dozens of html UIs. which is entirely different thing. so the complaint is in embedding one instance of a gigantic browser into each app.
[14:46:04] <Haohmaru> no, i'm not a www specialist
[14:46:23] <Haohmaru> i don't know what/how they use the webbrowser in those kinds of apps, and i don't care
[14:46:54] <Haohmaru> Khepra okay, that's <details.txt>
[14:47:20] <Khepra> <very important details.txt>
[14:48:53] <Khepra> chromeOS is good paradigm. you ahve one browser that interprets and renders all the UIs. a "calc" is just a few kb of javascripts that the one core browser renders natively
[14:49:10] <Khepra> they should rebase it on debian :)
[14:51:51] <Haohmaru> Khepra devs should use adequate libs, what's the point in getting a 2x faster computer when you're gonna run a program that's 10x slower than it could have been, because someone used a webbrowser-thing to "write the program faster/easier"
[14:52:01] <Aarch64debian> lol im retarded test app sees vm hardware..
[14:52:16] <jelly> when you pay the devs you can dictate what they "should" use
[14:52:38] <jelly> and sometimes not even then
[14:52:47] <Haohmaru> jelly yes.. basically i won't pay for no Electron-like sh*t
[14:53:17] <Khepra> Haohmaru: you still seem to not get it. using browser does not automagically mean something is 10x slower, or 20x worse, or 30x bigger.

[15:18:39] <darsie> I just did mkfs /dev/sdc1.
[15:18:57] <Haohmaru> sdc1 would be a partition on it, NOT the _whole_ SD card
[15:19:31] <Khepra> darsie: you should re-do it and be explicit about the filesystem you want.   `mkfs.ext4`  or `mkfs -t ext4`
[15:20:09] <xx> or run `sudo blkid` and it will tell you
[15:20:14] <darsie> ok. So I can't easily tell if its ext4?
[15:20:16] <Khepra> the manpage says ext2 is default if type isn't specified ... which I kinda doubt, but, hey, it's possible. not sure if debian alternatives set a default.

[15:26:44] <darsie> Well, that was much faster than ext2.
[15:27:44] <Khepra> darsie: well I was hoping the default in 2021... nay, almost 2022 would be at least ext4, but I guess I was being too optimistic :)
[15:27:49] <darsie> replug, automounted, appearently mounted as root, can't write as unprivileged user.
[15:28:27] <Khepra> yeah you must chown (or set permissions some other way) if your unprivileged user wants to write into a (mounted) filesystem
[15:28:28] <darsie> I can write to FAT usb drives.
[15:29:14] <Khepra> FAT has no concept of permissions, so on linux the mounting system sets a user-mountable mapping
[15:29:27] <darsie> I must own /media/bernhard/cd151f40-138d-483b-97d5-6ec7d8e9f2b6 ?
[15:29:53] <darsie> That's autogenerated by automount.
[15:29:59] <Khepra> do you? is that teh ext4 you just formatted and mounted?
[15:30:05] <darsie> Do I have to own it every time I automount it?
[15:30:11] <darsie> yes
[15:30:46] <Khepra> if that's ext4, you can chown the mountpoint (AFTER! it is mounted, like in the /media path above) and the ownership (by numerical UID) is permanent
[15:31:52] <darsie> So if I chown /media/bernhard/cd151f40-138d-483b-97d5-6ec7d8e9f2b6 it won't get deleted when I unmount it? Or will it remember somewhere else that I own it?
[15:32:46] <Khepra> the ext4 filesystem understands the concept of permissions and ownership and that metadata is part of the filesystem itself
[15:33:09] <Khepra> the ownership is by numeric UID (say, 1000) so if you mount that on _another_ machine the "ownership" will be whoeverr is the user with UID=1000
[15:33:57] <PerfDave> Generally speaking it's easier to use a system like vfat/exfat which doesn't have these concepts, on removable devices like SD cards or USB sticks.
[15:34:05] <darsie> yeah, works.

[15:40:23] <Khepra> is taht what you want? a flat filesystem with no permissions that can be easily mounted (and easily writeable) on more than one machine?
[15:41:07] <Khepra> it's not unusual for people to install full gnu/linux hierarchies (which absolutely require permissions and cannot run off of (ex)FAT for example), so one must be unambiguous in what they want here

[16:15:53] <MaxFrames> another|: why both?
[16:16:16] <MaxFrames> upgrade does not remove unnecessary packages, dist-upgrade does; correct?
[16:16:38] <another|> IIRC that was what was recommmended in the release notes
[16:16:56] <darsie> That's for upgrading to a new debian release.
[16:17:12] <darsie> Dunno if it's recommended for regular upgrades.
[16:17:27] <darsie> I usually do full-upgrade
[16:17:37] <MaxFrames> which is equivalent to dist-upgrade
[16:17:51] <Khepra> `apt upgrade` and stop worrying about it :)
[16:17:54] <randall> It does no harm on regular releases, andn in very seldom cases is needed. You need to pay attention to removed packages, though.
[16:19:12] <MaxFrames> what should I pay attention to specifically? sorry for the lame questions, I very seldom touch debian and when I have to, I'm rusted
[16:20:37] <xx> MaxFrames: pay attention to a very long list under the section 'these packages will be removed' and don't blindly press enter
[16:23:08] <MaxFrames> "apt upgrade" is equivalent to "apt-get upgrade" (i.e. no package removal) or to "apt-get dist-upgrade" (package removal)?
[16:25:15] <MaxFrames> and finally, can I use apt or apt-get absolutely at leisure? i.e. no need to stick with one if I had used it before?
[16:26:09] <Khepra> they have slightly different side-effects. eg, apt-get caches installed packages, so reinstallation after removal might come from local cache (no download required)
[16:26:56] <Khepra> apt-get is more suitable for scripting, and apt-get doesn't have the facilities apt has, like the "info" subcommand.
[16:27:16] <Khepra> bottom line, it's a huge mess of higher level package managers atop of dpkg and you can use whatever suits you best.
[16:27:22] *** Joins: brunoramoslu (~brunoramo@94.252.122.148)
[16:27:32] <MaxFrames> btw in my case apt-get dist-upgrade says "0 packages to remove", same than "apt-get upgrade"
[16:28:34] <Khepra> the difference between upgrade and dist-upgrade is confusing and dumb in my book. the ultimate question is upgrading packges and upgrading your release. there is only ONE way forward: upgrading as upgardes come in, stopping at major release boundaries.
[16:29:03] <Khepra> which translates to, always running dist-upgrade which moves you between point releases, but doesn't cross the major version boundary.
[16:29:39] <Khepra> any other interpretation of nuancing between packge selections (upgrade vs dist vs removal vs security only vs blah blah blah) is just a quagmire and quicksand you'll get drown in, confusing yourself to hell and back.
[16:30:29] <Khepra> in an ideal world where all the maintainers always did the best possible maintainership, those might have a meaning, but in real world:   upgrade and alwyas upgrade forward within major release.

[16:36:11] <Khepra> randall: ask the devs? :)
[16:36:34] <Khepra> I just know apt doesn't leave stuff in /var/cache/apt  and apt-get does, which requires frequent "clean" 'ing or else cruft eats up disk space
[16:36:49] <randall> Khepra: I don't see it documented anywhere, do you have a source for this claim?
[16:36:58] <xx> yeah, and `apt` is supposed to be the userfriendly alternative to apt-get (and other apt- commands)

[17:40:58] <Khepra> gtk is not a language but a framework/library

[17:41:26] <MaxFrames> "neckbeards" [...]
[17:41:27] <Khepra> C is most popular, but lately Rust is picking up. there's go for networking things, and python has a huge chunk
[17:41:28] <pingpongball> should i use gnome-builder or glade? whats the difference?
[17:41:36] <darsie> Debian is a GNU/Linux distribution. They package programs mostly done by others.

[17:42:18] <pingpongball> not neckbeards

[17:43:21] <Khepra> "neckbeards" made up /usr because they ran out of disk space. 30 years later, holy wars erupted around whether /usr should be mountable or not, on boot.  almost like Life of Brian, in how ridiculous it is.
[17:43:52] <Khepra> so "neckbeard" is derogative, if you ask me. definitely is if you assume all devs have growable beards to begin with.
[17:45:07] <idioterna> it's not a nice way to describe women who like to make free stuff

[18:53:56] <somiaj> well depends on what they mean by 'old' kernels.
[18:54:13] <Khepra> xx: we're a small team and we're overwhelmed. a paid canonical support is definitely be needed
[18:54:54] <Aarch64debian> termux is fast
[18:55:09] <Khepra> xx: yeah, the lack of clear signals as to what might be a security vuln is problematic. it's often problematic to even identify one. GKH and friends want everyone to run latest possible kernels, and the older the "LTS" ones get, the less likely it is it's ever gonna see patches

[18:56:50] <jmd> Since upgrading to bullseye booting has become very unreliable.  4 times
[18:56:50] <jmd>       out of 5, when I switch on, grub just says "error: Command failed."  is
[18:56:50] <jmd>       there a solution for this?
[18:56:56] <Khepra> but yes, I totally hated that thing. they effectively think their small team can do it better than the huge upstream

[18:57:20] <Khepra> jmd: if it's incosistent, I'd say with overwhelming probability that it's hardware related
[18:57:27] <xx> Khepra: well, ubuntu thought they could do better with Upstart, Mir, Unity, ...
[18:57:53] <xx> what's that networking thing they have now too?
[18:58:04] <jmd> Khepra: Well it's strange that it never happened until my first boot after upgrading to bullseye
[18:58:10] <Khepra> netplan.io but that's just a configurator for systemd-networkd
[18:58:16] <xx> yeah, that
[18:59:27] <Khepra> jmd: you can try re-doing the grub and intiramfs configs
[19:00:38] <Khepra> jmd: software upgrades revealing hardware issues is not impossible. I've had, more than once, systems working well until I did an upgrade and nudged things on disk to different sector, which then started failing not because the upgrade is buggy, but because the new location on disk is broken
[19:01:42] <Khepra> "you worked well until I rebooted!" is another. things remain in memory and underlying disk can rot away, which isn't visible until you reboot
[19:02:03] <Khepra> the longer the uptime, the larger the probability that it's not coming back online after next reboot.
[19:02:05] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[19:02:11] <somiaj> regressions also happen. Sometimes manually downgrading things using snapshot can help debug if it is hardware vs software. Though I would lean to hardware if it is inconsistant on if it boots or not.
[19:04:53] <Aarch64debian> will debian remove useful packages by fault
[19:05:19] <somiaj> Aarch64debian: what do you mean 'by fault'?
[19:05:57] <Aarch64debian> doing wrong calculate
[19:06:01] <somiaj> debian does remove packages in testing/unstable (the development branch) if they are no longer maintainable for some reason and have rc bugs. Though they don't get removed from the stable release.

[19:08:51] <kveroneau> Didn't that happen to Linus on Linus Tech Tips? :D
[19:09:02] <xx> somiaj: https://www.debian.org/News/2021/2021100902 the section 'removed packages'
[19:09:07] <kveroneau> He installed Steam I think, and it uninstalled his entire DE.
[19:09:36] <xx> and you can find the same section in each news entry for 10.10, 10.9, ...
[19:09:45] <somiaj> Aarch64debian: this is more due to package dependencies. If you have conflicts or incompadable packages, installing one will remove any packages that conflict.
[19:10:22] <xx> kveroneau: I don't know who that is, but with that name they better become an expert on linux :)

[19:13:37] <somiaj> yea, between releases happens fairly often, I just didn't notice that they were removed from a current stable release. This must mean there is some grave bug or incompadability that it is just safer to remove.
[19:14:25] <somiaj> xx: using aptitude vs apt can do this fairly easily, just have some minor conflict that removes a metapackage, then aptitude removes all autoremove packages by default while apt requires you do this as a separate command

[19:16:29] <kveroneau> xx, no problem
[19:17:22] <kveroneau> But when the package manager says it is removing a ton of packages and says it's not advised, you best listen to the warning. haha Linus didn't and learned the hard way.
[19:17:56] <Aarch64debian> maybe macosx wont uninstall useful stuffs
[19:18:11] <kveroneau> Maybe.
[19:18:51] <kveroneau> macOS isn't a bad OS whatsoever, it's just that Apple charges way too much for it.
[19:19:17] <kveroneau> However, I do perfer the Debian package manager say over homebrew though.
[19:19:21] <somiaj> Also has an advantage of so many developers are working under a single umbrella along with make sure stuff like that won't happen.
[19:19:56] <xx> is debian better than Pop Exclamation Mark Under Score OS
[19:20:25] <kveroneau> xx, I fully agree.  I tried Pop in a VM once, it was alright, but it wasn't Debian.

[22:51:32] <buzzard> i'm trying to use WSL's debian to step into glibc code and gdb isn't able to find e.g. ioputs.c.  i've installed the glibc-source package but the source files are all tarballed in /usr/src/glibc/<tarball>.  where are these files typically extracted to (such that gdb will find them)?
