[14:54:51] <getivan> https://regex101.com/r/D6HGL8/4 --- I had this regex made for finding addresses on-page, but my problem now is that I think it's a little too complex, and it's causing threadlocks and crashes. I can't get-a-hold of the guy who made it for me, so it'd be nice if someone could help me simplify my string... thanks!

[16:24:33] <digitok> just made it more simple

[16:24:51] <digitok> lol
[16:24:58] <digitok> you're getting..?
[16:24:58] <getivan> :p

[16:25:54] <getivan> Stuff like that... ... it'
[16:26:13] <getivan> it's hard to tell the ratio... not a big deal... just wasn't sure if that had anything to do with what you did...
[16:27:39] <getivan> I got about 75k urls in my test sample, and it has done 33k with your simplified version, without crashing the server, so it's good so far... :p  Looks like it's slowing down, though... >.<  
[16:28:59] <digitok> ffs
[16:29:34] <digitok> do you have the direct link to the img
[16:30:28] <getivan> What? You can't see the image? It's right there in that shortlink...
[16:30:40] <ham5urg> I need to define a regex to match european names, e.g. Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼Ã„Ã–ÃœÃŸ are possible, or (abc), etc. The only thing which I can guarantee that " is at the beginning and at the end and not in between. I would have used ^"[:alnum:]{2:128}"$ but how I understand it, it wont match characters besides a-zA-Z0-9. How should I design a regex for that problem? 
[16:31:14] <digitok> yes the page isn't displaying properly and i can't be bothered fixing it
[16:31:24] <digitok> i use lightshot, it's a neat extension, but the site is atrocious
[16:31:44] <digitok> you can copy/paste the image url
[16:32:39] <digitok> 07ham5urg, and these names are on individual lines?
[16:32:40] <getivan> It doesn't give a proper image url, on that site, though... it does, like: data:image/png;base64 etc... sec.. I'll try to get a direct link from someplace...
[16:33:10] <ham5urg> digitok, yes, I parse line by line.
[16:33:17] <digitok> you can't right click the image and click open image in new tab?
[16:33:28] <digitok> 07ham5urg, which language/tool
[16:33:38] <ham5urg> python3, pyparsing
[16:34:20] <getivan> No, with lightshot, they give you a weird encoded url thing... I don't think they want you using their image hosting to embed images in places, is the thing...
[16:35:00] <digitok> right, i thought i'd got a direct link before, but anyway
[16:35:16] <digitok> if you're just getting some invalid results, paste them into regex101
[16:35:44] <digitok> 07ham5urg, ^"\w{2,128}"$
[16:35:47] <digitok> see if that works

[16:38:04] <digitok> right
[16:38:27] <digitok> pasting into re101 is better tbh :p
[16:38:30] <digitok> but i get the idea
[16:38:35] <getivan> So, I gave these guys this huge complete list of USA address permutations, but it came out to over 2k combinations, and no one could make that work without causing severe processing issues. So, I reduced it to five common footprints: 1. 7777 street, city, state zip
[16:38:35] <getivan> 1-1. 7777 street city, state zip
[16:38:36] <getivan> 1-2. 7777 street city state zip
[16:38:36] <getivan> 2. city, state zip
[16:38:37] <getivan> 3. state zip

[16:40:56] <digitok> it means the data is right there for us to edit the regex
[16:41:02] <getivan> Anyways, that's sort of where we left off... and I don't really know how close he got to those variations. He decided to quit, before really finishing the job. LoL --- and yeah, I'll try to use regex101 for pasting, from now on...
[16:42:50] <getivan> So, how close, would you say, Digitok, did that guy get to expressing those main variations? Because I know you said there was a lot of processing going on, and yeah, I'd like to cover a variety of variations, but it also can't be so heavy that it causes slow processing, or threadlocks, or server crashes... etc...
[16:43:49] <getivan> The simplified line you gave me is now 63k/75k, so it seems to be working much better! :D  --- I guess I'm just wondering if it can be improved in any capacity... thanks! :)  
[16:44:07] <digitok> yea it can
[16:44:08] <digitok> one sec
[16:44:14] <getivan> Sure.. thanks! 
[16:46:51] <digitok> so "state zip" could be "ny 12345" or "new york 12345" right
[16:47:35] <getivan> Here are essentially all the possible permutations: https://pastebin.com/BzwjcGzT
[16:47:42] <digitok> noty
[16:47:42] <digitok> :D
[16:47:49] <digitok> 5 is good
[16:47:50] <getivan> It can be pretty vast, but yes,
[16:48:06] <ham5urg> digitok, how to define a string with multiple spaces? \w|(\w(\s\w){2,128} is not correct, I would like to match whitespace too but keep it simple if possible.
[16:48:21] <digitok> it's hard to make something where almost all of it is optional without it being slow
[16:48:40] <ham5urg> \w in python3 is good, as it is a Unicode letter. Thanks for the hint.
[16:48:54] <digitok> yep
[16:49:20] <digitok> so when you say whitespace is allowed, that's included in the 2-128 limit right?
[16:49:29] <ham5urg> yes
[16:49:37] <digitok> and you want to allow just " " or tabs etc?
[16:49:43] <getivan> The address can be 1 to 5 digits and a street name from one to four'ish words, or more, but it has to be limited, then the city can be one to four'ish words, and the state is one or two words and the zip is five or nine digits, but generally five. There are subtleties with comma and dash placements, as well. The five I listed are the main concern. 
[16:50:04] <ham5urg> just " " but a \s would be ok too if easier.
[16:50:16] <digitok> 07ham5urg, 07[\w ]{2,128}
[16:50:22] <ham5urg> ahhh
[16:50:24] <digitok> or [\w\s] if you want to allow other spaces
[16:50:27] <ham5urg> so easy, great
[16:50:28] <ham5urg> thanks
[16:50:33] <digitok> np
[16:54:25] <getivan> It's ideal if it can find the very first variation, but then if it can look for number 2, then number 3, etc, then that's better than not finding #1. Sometimes business owners just put city, state zip, so that's better than nothing. Obviously, the mechanic for processing in steps seems maybe cumbersome, even at small scale, and the error handling
[16:54:26] <getivan> for missing commas is maybe excessive... so I'm open to suggestions, or a better understanding of limitations. I tried talking about this with VAs, but language barriers made it impossible to communicate on this, really... thanks! 
[16:55:33] <digitok> what's a va
[16:56:22] <ham5urg> Python3 does not support a regex \P does it?

[16:57:42] <digitok> 07ham5urg, nope
[16:59:24] <digitok> hmm
[17:00:53] <ham5urg> I tried with [\w\W ]{2,128} (companies do have sometimes ()- in their names) but it consumes " too which is used as input, e.g. "a silly compÃ¤ny (ABC)" is my input" with " as input too.
[17:01:32] <ham5urg> Overconsuming I guess.
[17:01:53] <digitok> :|
[17:02:08] <digitok> \w\W matches every char
[17:02:24] <digitok> so what's your goal?
[17:02:36] <digitok> match 2-128 of any char except " ?
[17:03:01] <ham5urg> Yes, that is right.
[17:03:10] <digitok> so the example you mentioned above shouldn't match right?
[17:03:33] <ham5urg> Yes, it does not match right.
[17:03:38] <digitok> lol
[17:03:47] <digitok> i meant "it shouldn't match, right?"
[17:03:54] <digitok> so you're saying it should match?
[17:04:14] <digitok> or it currently is and shouldn't be :p
[17:06:22] <digitok> 07getivan, do you know what regex scrapebox uses
[17:08:11] <digitok> ok apparently it's pcre
[17:08:33] <digitok> in this case, that's a shame
[17:08:34] <digitok> lol
[17:09:31] <ham5urg> I tried to combine (?<!\") with [\w\W ]{2,128} but idk how.
[17:10:06] <getivan> Digitok, they just told me that it's PCRE.

[17:10:49] <digitok> 07ham5urg, i was waiting for your answer

[17:11:00] <getivan> :D  
[17:11:18] <digitok> no, as i said, in this case, it closes options
[17:13:37] <digitok> you have a lot of data, and at a minimum, all you need to match is 1 word followed by 5 digits

[17:19:59] <getivan> Ahhh... you're right, digitok... I never thought of using the digits like that... because I guess all the variations will include a zip and a state.

[17:35:13] <digitok> yea, that'll only work in .net (c# etc) or es6 (javascript)
[17:35:59] <digitok> /7 seems to match the examples with street numbers
[17:40:37] <getivan> Ohhh, okay... gotcha... yeah, Scrapebox is written in Dephi, and they use PCRE. I tried the /7, but it just did cities, states and zips... it's no worries... your shortened version is getting me some results, for sure... the sad thing is that all my regex runs well individually, but then when I try to get the program to run all of them at the same
[17:40:38] <getivan> time, for a custom spreadsheet, then it populates the sheet very sporadically. I sent support a message about it, so I guess we'll see what they say. If you know of a better scraping tool, digitok, then I'm all ears. Scrapebox helps me do a lot of things easily, but I keep saying to myself that it would be amazing to make something really simple
[17:40:38] <getivan> from python, and just use regex, like this. I'm aware of some things like ubot and octoparse, and some others, but they seem to be even worse than Scrapebox. Something with an interface would be nice... >.<  
[17:42:48] <digitok> right, actually /8 would work in python using the 'regex' module
[17:44:27] <getivan> Gotcha...  now I just need to find a python based scraping interface. :p   Anyways... thanks for your time, digitok, I really appreciate the shortening solution! :D

[17:59:06] <getivan> Digitok, the /10 and/11 returned almost exclusively city, state zip, but the /9 seems viable! What is the difference between the /9 and the shortened version you did, before? Here: https://regex101.com/r/Iejt89/1
[18:02:45] <digitok> the a-zA-Z instead of \w is what fixes it matching those coordinates in the screenshot
[18:03:09] <digitok> i used \w because it's shorter
[18:03:12] <digitok> hehe
[18:04:08] <digitok> it's weird that /11 isn't getting the same matches
[18:04:15] <digitok> (plus more)
[18:04:17] <getivan> Oh, I see... so that one is actually better... nice... I will use that one, then! :D  Another step forward by Digitok! :)  
[18:04:28] <digitok> :p
[18:05:45] <digitok> you said almost exclusively, so /11 does get some with street numbers
[18:05:53] <digitok> very weird
[18:06:40] <getivan> Yes, but it's like a very small ratio... I can scroll for thousands and see only city state zip... I guess Scrapebox sees it in some particular way...
[18:06:52] <getivan> Let me test, again...
[18:07:34] <digitok> can you test against just the data in the regex101 link maybe
[18:07:41] <digitok> there's only 10 matches there
[18:08:40] <digitok> just weird that it would get any at all if it's not working for some reason
[18:08:52] <digitok> it's exactly the same as /9 except with the first digits made optional
[18:11:45] <getivan> I guess it could be going through the instructions, and then it picks up that particular pattern, for some reason. That's one thing that comes to mind. The other thing is that is might actually be picking up more, and in such abundance that it appears to make the whole sample seem like city state zip. It's impossible for me to tell, without just
[18:11:45] <getivan> testing a small sample, though, because I can't see total number of records collected in real time, only the number of urls processed... one sec... I'll drop the url sample, and run two tests, and see what happens between the strings. :p

[18:47:55] <getivan> Okay, Digitok... apologies for the delay, but threadlocks often happen at the end of scrapes, and that's what took a second to process, across three different scrapes. What's the best way to get this spreadsheet to you, you think? Just Google Drive? The summary is that out of a 1k url sample the /9 returned about 400 to 600 lines, and the /11
[18:47:56] <getivan> returned 3k to 5k. There's a range, because like I was saying before, when you combine regex in a single job, for some reason it has errors. On the whole, though... /11 was massively more prolific. At a glance, it seems like /9 is a lot better at yielding really good well-formatted results, and in the combined scrape you would expect the same urls
[18:47:56] <getivan> to give the same results between the two of them... and in some cases we can see that in this file, but in many cases, they are returning two different results for fully qualified addresses. Since /11 is yielding about 4x more results than there are urls (1k), I would guess that they are in there somewhere.  Anyways... if you want to see this
[18:47:57] <getivan> spreadsheet, just let me know, and I'll try to get it to you somehow... :p  Thanks, man! :D

[18:51:26] <Me-me> You gotta stop doin' that man.
[18:51:47] <re101-eagle-56> Where is the code generator
[18:51:53] <Me-me> !codegen
[18:51:53] <perlbot> Select code generator on the left side of regex101 to view sample code for your language of choice.
[18:53:06] <getivan> Doing what? I just typed a paragraph... :O  
[18:53:30] <digitok> a super long one haha
[18:53:48] <digitok> it got split into 4 lines
[18:54:15] <re101-eagle-56> Oh thanks, i saw it, it's hidden
[18:54:21] <getivan> Also, I just scrubbed the URLs, and the /9 = 180 unique URLs versus the /11 = 451, so the difference isn't as big as it seems, I guess... the /11 is just picking up a lot more results per page, I guess...
[18:55:43] <digitok> is there no way to test it against only the data in the regex101 link
[18:55:47] <getivan> Oh, I see... well, as long as the message gets through... I guess I can shorten my soliloquy... :p  
[18:56:48] <digitok> you need to feed it a url yea?
[18:56:54] <digitok> not a string
[18:57:26] <digitok> if so, maybe you can give it this url https://bpa.st/raw/Z3LA
[18:57:28] *** Quits: re101-eagle-56 (~re101-eag@205.177.199.168) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:57:40] <getivan> Well, that would be like testing against the content on a single web page... I think that's fine for when you write the regex, but I still have to do a test scrape, and see what actually gets picked up across a variety of sites....
[18:58:34] <digitok> wait so /11 is picking up the ones with street numbers then?
[18:58:46] <digitok> i.e. the same ones that /9 picks up plus more?
[18:58:57] <digitok> because that's good isn't it
[19:00:07] <getivan> Yeah, I can run that, sec... it would be a lot more data intensive to just send this excel sheet, though, because it's got the address renderings... but yeah, /11 is doing much better at-scale... for sure! It doesn't share the same ones as /9 on the same urls all the time, though... /11 is definitely the future, though! :D  
[19:01:03] <digitok> hehe
[19:02:04] <getivan> Ah, shoot... how do I share this result with you, now? LoL I guess I need to paste the spreadsheet values into a regex101?
[19:02:55] <digitok> that's the result from the bpa.st link?
[19:03:19] <getivan> Yeah, I've got it here
[19:03:26] <getivan> My server just crashed LoL 
[19:03:35] <digitok> lol
[19:03:48] <digitok> well on regex101, /9 gives 7 results and /11 gives 10 results
[19:03:53] <digitok> is that the same as you got?
[19:04:12] <getivan> No, it's not the same... in this case /9 did a lot better... sec...
[19:04:51] <digitok> yea you should just be able to highlight them and copy
[19:05:02] <digitok> paste into bpa.st
[19:06:22] <getivan> Sec, it doesn't render right...
[19:10:03] <getivan> Here, you go, Digitok: https://pastebin.com/zGhxXVbc
[19:11:07] <digitok> :|
[19:11:22] <getivan> What?
[19:12:34] <digitok> super weird
[19:12:39] <digitok> that program sucks
[19:12:39] <digitok> :D
[19:13:44] <getivan> Heh... yeah, maybe so... I wonder if it would return the same result each time... sec...
[19:15:12] <digitok> hm, actually, are those combined results
[19:15:22] <digitok> like it's using both regex at the same time?
[19:17:47] <getivan> It looks like the results are the exact same each time I run it, and yes, those are the combine results. Let me try running one-at-a-time...
[19:18:09] <digitok> the only one it's missing is "state 12345"
[19:18:25] <digitok> but in theory, 11 alone should grab all of them
[19:18:43] <digitok> or at least all of the results shown in your paste
[19:18:49] <digitok> brb
[19:26:02] <getivan> Yeah, individually, it looks like it did better, Digitok: https://pastebin.com/X4qEahii (I combined the results afterwards, so you could see in one sheet) 
[19:26:52] <digitok> yep that's exactly as on re101

[19:35:21] <getivan> Gotcha... so /11 really is doing everything /9 is doing... that's awesome!  This is great stuff, man, well done...  Now we just need Scrapebox support to acknowledge the problem with running multiple regex in a single instance definition.
[19:36:28] <getivan> I mainly use keywords to scrape yahoo for urls, then from there, there is a lot of data handling, before scraping information. One of the benefits of Scrapebox is the ability to create little if this, then that, sort of mini-scripts. So, it makes the URL collection process pretty easy. 
[19:36:46] <getivan> The actual data collection phase has some quirks, though, as you can clearly see. Maybe making a dash just for the actual collection phase is worthwhile. (heh)
[19:39:29] <digitok> what's all this actually for
[19:50:03] <getivan> B2B Leads... I sell them to business owners who wanna send promos to companies based on niches...
[19:52:14] <getivan> Some folks want addresses sometimes, so I'm trying to see if I can get that in there... also, though... it allows for a more refined location on the niche urls I collect for local scrapes...

[19:54:03] <getivan> Why do you do this for free, btw, Digitok? You could make some side cash giving answers like this...
[19:57:59] <Me-me> Some of us do. But mostly we're here because we like to help.
[19:58:11] <purplex> He accepts cash if you are willing to send.
[19:58:17] <testuser[m]> Where
[19:58:25] <Me-me> Also, there's a distinction between "able to do things people charge money for" and "able to find people willing to pay money for those things".
[20:02:34] <purplex> I think that regex was worth about $100, so complex.

[20:03:19] <digitok> lol
[20:05:14] <getivan> Just open marketplaces like fiverr, konker, legiit, etc. I spent $20 on fiverr and got a partial result, then digitok brought it home. Now, I'm gonna do a video for my youtube channel, soon, and it'd be best if I could send folks to a backlink where they could hire him, rather than here... I'll send folks here, though.... his time was definitely
[20:05:15] <getivan> worth a good amount, but wouldn't drop $100 for that... no disrespect... you are right, though, because now I've got it forever... instead of cash, though, I can show you how to create recurring income on fiverr, though, and if you take action you'll make a lot more...
[20:07:32] <Me-me> You realise doing 95% price drop from the suggested price isn't actually "paying" for the work, right?
[20:08:06] <Me-me> If I ask my friends to help me move, they'd probably help. If I offered to pay them half a dollar to help me move, how do you think they'd react?
[20:08:07] <getivan> You do realize that the money isn't in the $5 orders, right?

[20:10:53] <Me-me> Look, I'll try not to escalate this.
[20:11:00] <purplex> You do realize that time is also money, right? It has been more than 7 hours now with that regex lol
[20:11:22] <getivan> If I give you $5... you can spend that in five seconds, and it's gone... it's not about the money... it's about collecting reviews. Those reviews are forever, and they create recurring income. If you're gonna do work for free, here, you lose nothing by doing the exact same thing over on fiverr, but the difference is that you're working for the
[20:11:23] <getivan> reviews.... down the line, you up the prices after a lot of good reviews... that's how it works... that's how I make more than $1k/mo from just fiverr orders. Back when I had my $5 offer, I made over $2k/mo, but it was a lot more work... LoL... those $5 offers are just a foot-in-the-door... people constantly buy the upsells....
[20:15:03] <Me-me> Anyway, see ya.
[20:20:26] <getivan> Yeah, but most of that time was me testing his variations. He wasn't typing furiously for 7hrs. LoL --- He was here, though, the whole time so much respect for that. I'll give $20, just as a courtesy tip, but it was also based on something I already spent $20 for. Anyways... no disrespect... I was just trying to show some appreciation, and not
[20:20:26] <getivan> leave digitok empty handed for his efforts. 
[20:24:04] <getivan> Anyways, send me a payment link, so I can close this tab, already... LoL
[20:24:27] <purplex> I see. Yep, Looks like this was your first time, hm. Alright. Digitok, are you okay with receiving $20 from this since he really wants to show appreciation?
[20:25:29] <getivan> ??? this isn't my first time, I've used these channels for like two years... not really sure what you mean by that...
[20:25:50] <getivan> it used to be over at frenode
[20:26:04] <getivan> ***freenode, right?
[20:26:21] <digitok> yep
[20:26:38] <purplex> Yeah ok you just sounded like somewhat surprised by receiving regex, I don't know
[20:26:51] <digitok> i accept donations via crypto :p
[20:27:50] <getivan> No, it's just that, like you said, he spent 7hrs, and I'd like for him to get something from it... just trying to show some respect, is all...
