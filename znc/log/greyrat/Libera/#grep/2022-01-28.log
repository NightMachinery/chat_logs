[03:34:20] <bn_work> OnlineCop:  Interesting, I wasn't aware of `(*SKIP)` and `(*FAIL)`, I'm still a bit fuzzy about how it works reading https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre#(*SKIP)-(*SKIP:NAME) but I guess I'll keep that in mind for next time.

[19:19:13] <OnlineCop> bn_work: I realize this reply is late (you've probably already moved on with your work), but I've actually used this `(*SKIP)(*FAIL)` with `grep -P` in my daily routines.
[19:19:20] <OnlineCop> For example: `NO_STR_OR_COM='(?:[#].*|//.*|/[*].*?[*]/["](?>[^\\"]+|\\.)*["])(*SKIP)(*F)|' ; grep -PRn --include=\*.{py,c,cpp,h,R} ${NO_STR_OR_COM}'some_pattern_here' /path/to/recurse/into`
[19:19:24] <OnlineCop> That allows me to search for whatever pattern I'm after but always exclude that text if it's after comments (#..., //..., /*...*/) or within "quoted strings".
[19:22:08] <bn_work> OnlineCop: oh neat, that's an ugly regex but seems super-useful, do you just add it to your .bashrc or so?
[19:27:22] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/KQjdt7/1 if it helps.
[19:30:33] <OnlineCop> Yeah; I actually have a bunch of these defined separately, instead of all blobbed together like I have above. More like this: https://regex101.com/r/KQjdt7/2
[19:37:02] <OnlineCop> I usually do ^ /2 style in my .bashrc so I can define my exclusions one-by-one as needed: `PY_COM='[#].*(*SKIP)(*F)|' #note trailing | ` , `C_COM='//.*(*SKIP)(*F)|` , etc., which lets me chain them when grepping (also works with ack, ripgrep, perl, and any other PCRE-compliant tool).
