[02:10:09] <axisys_> putting words per line in one line colon separated, but how do I avoid the last colon?
[02:10:12] <axisys_> awk '{printf "%s:", $1}' file
[02:10:12] <axisys_> a:b:c:
[02:14:39] <mknod> # printf '%s\n' a b c | awk '{printf("%s%s", NR > 1 ? ":" : "", $1)}'

[02:17:48] <emanuele6> nevermind
[02:18:27] <axisys_> if awk could do join .. logic would have simpler :-)

[02:21:04] <mknod> axisys_, I doubt you could pass it any useful argument as you are processing lines.
