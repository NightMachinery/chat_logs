[02:27:38] <_genuser_> JakeSays well refer to the useless community comment. and who wrote the docs? same people. so if something wasn't clear you went and asked and they were even more cryptic and snobby. It was generally possible to get stuff done, just didn't need the hassle. I ran it. It ran fine. It tended to be behind the times in package versions. So I eventually

[03:01:21] <MizMahem> Gentlemen, BEHOLD! I have performed... MATH!! https://sharplab.io/#gist:acf3e3f450da68e1bc80fe5fa7ad3e58
[03:03:46] <Nasp> What does it do
[03:05:56] <JakeSays> MizMahem: that's pretty cool
[03:08:32] <MizMahem> @Nasp calculates the number of digits (according to power of 10) in an int.
[03:08:44] <jonp> MizMahem: have you heard that .NET 6 has a preview for *real* generic math?
[03:08:58] <jonp> MizMahem: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/preview-features-in-net-6-generic-math/
[03:09:05] <MizMahem> jonp oh yes, I have played with it some and am eagerly awaiting it.
[03:09:09] <jonp> provided via "static abstract methods in interfaces"
[03:09:12] <MizMahem> can't really do this generically though.
[03:09:16] <MizMahem> But yeah, I'm all about that.
[03:09:25] <jonp> i want it, but the very name makes my head hurt
[03:09:26] <MizMahem> Was talking over on the discord about the greatness earlier.
[03:09:27] <Nasp> I want the .NET 6 features :(
[03:09:30] <Nasp> And .NET 5 as well
[03:09:39] <jonp> Nasp: can't get off .NET Framework?
[03:09:44] <Nasp> jonp:  Trying
[03:09:51] <Nasp> 250 something controllers to do
[03:09:54] <Nasp> to go*
[03:10:30] <Nasp> But i can't see us getting rid of framework for the next year or so since we are too few devs to move the bits that can't be moved
[03:10:32] <_genuser_> so apparently converting .net code to python is modernizing things.
[03:10:42] <MizMahem> `IParsable<T>` will be awesome. Will be so many awesome things...
[03:10:52] <MizMahem> _genuser_: ack.
[03:10:59] <_genuser_> this recruiter tells me all about how this team is making everything modern. changing stuff from .net framework and azure to python and aws.
[03:11:00] <MizMahem> I would hurt someone :P
[03:11:22] <MizMahem> sounds like they got some junior coders who can't into C#.
[03:11:34] <MizMahem> I can't think of any other reason to migrate existing working code to python.
[03:11:40] <MizMahem> Not to bash it but come on... really?
[03:11:43] <Nasp> jonp:  I would have to migrate controllers + views and a tons of old backbone to get rid of framework
[03:11:46] <_genuser_> and I was like.... oh ok. I don't really know too much python and  I haven't used AWS before, so I won't really be on that team. So I don't care about talking to the recruiter that THAT is not modernizing.
[03:11:56] <Nasp> And i kinda prefer it just being converted to the SPA we started on 5 years ago
[03:12:08] <_genuser_> MizMahem it's an architect moving code to python as they're re-architecting this stuff.
[03:12:13] <_genuser_> for the new modern era apparently.
[03:12:34] <MizMahem> madness knows no bounds then apparently.
[03:13:46] <MizMahem> I really don't hate python but like I think that while dynamically typed languages have their place, teaching them to beginners is a mistake. Types exist. You need to learn how to deal with them from the very beginning.
[03:14:20] <_genuser_> You mean teaching people HTML and telling them they're learning programming is not a good idea?
[03:14:30] <jonp> MizMahem: meh, disagree
[03:14:42] <MizMahem> over on the discord I see a lot of programmers trained in python who just can't into a type system when trying to make the switch and like... this is a *very very* fundamental concept. If you can't understand it, you have problems.
[03:14:49] <_genuser_> or teaching people javascript and and telling them that's what development looks like?
[03:15:04] <_genuser_> althought with front-end frameworks a good bit of development does look like JS/TS type work.
[03:15:13] <xb0o2> For a lot of JS developers, that's what it does look like
[03:15:42] <_genuser_> right, I'd say that's fair now.
[03:15:45] <jonp> MizMahem: imho, "beginners" need something *concrete*, to *want* to do "something"
[03:15:58] <jonp> that might very well be Excel formulas, to be more productive
[03:16:02] <jonp> or scripting of some form
[03:16:20] <jonp> many environments don't have type systems, or have very minimal ones, and those are where many will begin
[03:17:09] <MizMahem> no I get that. And there is value in being able to stand something up quick.
[03:17:16] <Nasp> I've seen so many js devs when they switched to TS using any
[03:17:19] <Nasp> I am now using types :D
[03:17:27] <MizMahem> But there is also value in learning some fundamental concepts at the very beginning as well.
[03:17:46] <MizMahem> I'm not saying C# is necessarily the best language to start on. It probably isn't.
[03:17:54] <MizMahem> I'm just not sure python is either.
[03:18:01] <MizMahem> Bring back LOGO and BASIC I guess lol.
[03:18:04] <_genuser_> I started with c/c++ mixture, which apparently the teachers didn't care to address. They neither focused on one or the other, nor pointed out the mixture of all that in student's work.
[03:18:09] <_genuser_> then I moved to vb3. hehe
[03:18:12] <_genuser_> variant this variant taht.
[03:18:31] <Ungy> So I am trying to use AutoMapper to take an object that has an array of child objects like [ {a:1, b: [{c:2},{c:3}]}] to give me an output like [ {a: 1, c: 2},{a: 1, c: 3}] Anyone know the terms I might need to search for to accomplish this. I thought it was called flattening but no luck there.
[03:18:47] <MizMahem> I started on like BASIC on the Apple IIE and then on to GWBasic and then other things
[03:19:18] <xb0o2> MizMahem, you talk about "learning fundamental concepts" but in reality type systems are not fundamental concepts
[03:19:57] <xb0o2> There has been a lot of very important computation that hasn't been done under a type system at all
[03:19:58] <MizMahem> you don't think type systems are fundamental? 🤔
[03:20:09] <xb0o2> No
[03:20:21] <xb0o2> Do I think they are fundamental? no
[03:20:24] <Ungy> xb0o2 every language has it's own fundementals. like in JS if you don;t understand closures your going to get in trouble very quickly
[03:20:28] <xb0o2> Do I think they are extremely useful? yes
[03:20:58] <MizMahem> I mean, okay. I'm not saying type systems are the be all and end all? Not necessarily. Is it a concept that I think is just as important to understand early on as like functions and loops? Yes.
[03:21:14] <xb0o2> I mean, you're welcome to that take
[03:21:35] <xb0o2> But there are a lot of people that produce a lot more important code than you do without type systems
[03:21:44] <MizMahem> lol
[03:21:53] <Cecen> Important code that isn't intended to be maintained*
[03:22:02] <xb0o2> All I'm saying is that propagating the idea that "anything untyped is bad" and "anything typed is good" is a shitty take
[03:22:10] <MizMahem> but that's not my take?
[03:22:16] <MizMahem> I'm not sure how you got that from what I said.
[03:22:40] <xb0o2> Well, I guess I received it as an implication from "types are a fundamental concept"
[03:22:46] <_genuser_> if you all are gonna fight about this - then I'm gonna also diss MVC and some modern patterns.
[03:23:07] <Nasp> I would argue the type system helps a lot
[03:23:12] <_genuser_> if we wrote all the code to run all the equipment to land humans on the moon without MVC and such.... then it's all crap.
[03:23:14] <Nasp> And i dont find it to block me in what i do
[03:23:18] <xb0o2> It does help a lot. It's not fundamental to writing code though.
[03:23:25] <MizMahem> I'm saying beginners need to learn about variable typing very early on because it is a concept that is going to likely be important *especially* in the sort of code problems beginners are going to want to challenge.
[03:23:33] <MizMahem> Like say "getting input from the user and then doing something with it."
[03:23:35] <Nasp> MizMahem:  It really depends on their education
[03:23:45] <xb0o2> MizMahem: there are a lot of languages where it's not, though. So...?
[03:23:50] <Nasp> Like when i started computer science we learned java blue j
[03:24:01] <Nasp> Which was a sort of graphical way to teach people about OOP
[03:24:06] <Nasp> And it confused the hell out of some people
[03:24:11] <_genuser_> in c/c++ days, I'd read in EVERYTHNG as a string. then parse it. lol.
[03:24:21] <_genuser_> and store everything as string.
[03:24:38] <Nasp> We have some people who hate types and just uses strings or objects
[03:24:42] <Nasp> I dont get it
[03:24:45] <Nasp> And it's unmaintainable
[03:24:46] <_genuser_> Nasp so you must be an expert in javascript
[03:25:01] <Nasp> Nope
[03:25:10] <_genuser_> Nasp but you said java?
[03:25:51] <Ungy> I have two nephews learnign programming they don't understand many basic concepts. I am teachign the differences between strongly, weakly and dynamically. I probably won't approach statically typing but I think it is essential.
[03:26:26] <_genuser_> teh ways things are going, we'll be writing everythign in javascript soon.
[03:26:29] <Nasp> _genuser_:  During studyt
[03:26:33] <Nasp> Which i've never used since
[03:27:10] <_genuser_> Nasp heh, I was trying to interchange java and javascript because I've been hearing some recruiters do that. It's always hilarious.
[03:27:27] <Nasp> Also what do you call that type of code that isn't as flexiable, like lets say you make a seating table and you've designed so each table has 4 seats
[03:27:44] <Nasp> And that's fucking hardcoded into everything instead of being able to create a table with x number of seats
[03:27:52] <Nasp> _genuser_:  Ahh
[03:27:54] <_genuser_> that's just good common sense.
[03:27:58] <_genuser_> that's how you create job security.
[03:28:03] <_genuser_> nobody will want to touch that code.
[03:28:19] <_genuser_> you can continue billing $120/hr  maintaining that system with hardcoded 4 seat table.
[03:28:39] <Nasp> Ohh great we are now 11 devs instead of 9

[03:40:09] <jonp> MizMahem: iirc it *can* be the case, but the compiler chooses what to do based on the number of cases
[03:40:14] <jonp> you might not have enough cases?
[03:42:15] <MizMahem> I think it should do it in every case it can.

[10:39:17] <ki9a> You can do a test with given a bit of input from apiA check if the output is correct.

[10:45:06] <k8yun> generic
[10:45:07] <k8yun> ok
[10:45:14] <ki9a> You have a generic type Task

[10:45:21] *** Joins: MaNa2k (~MaNa2k@224.81-166-66.customer.lyse.net)
[10:45:36] <ki9a> action result happens to be a generic tpye too and has CouponDto as parameter
[10:45:54] <ki9a> In this particular case; the Task is used to deal with async methods.
[10:46:02] <ki9a> which is a tricky subject to start with
[10:46:21] <Nasp> I like they added Action result generic parameter, by it when you have task and a list it's a bit annoying
[10:46:21] <ki9a> ACtionResult<T> is how asp.net core returns data to the client OR error codes (or both)
[10:46:30] <ki9a> It gets a bit long :)
[10:46:48] <k8yun> this is enough to get me going
[10:47:20] <k8yun> i'll probably come back in a week and ask a few more question after going through the key concepts
[10:47:24] <k8yun> thank you
[10:47:33] <ki9a> do you have experience with other languages?
[10:47:41] <k8yun> c/c++/python
[10:47:56] <k8yun> but haven't been programming for over 15 years
[10:48:00] <ki9a> async is comparable to a co-routine
[10:48:12] <ki9a> which you probably don't know because they got added to c++ a few years ago ;)
[10:48:22] <k8yun> yeah, that's new term
[10:48:24] <k8yun> co-routine
[10:48:48] <ki9a> flow wise it's like a regular method
[10:49:11] <ki9a> conceptually it's interruptable and can be resumed at "await" points.
[10:49:41] <ki9a> so any place that has "await", the code check, is this other thing that returns a task already done? If not, I'll yield and resume later
[10:49:54] <MatthiasVance> k8yun: What brings you back to programming?
[10:50:13] <k8yun> async in a sense the method gets called without expecting the response right away? not sure... I didn't touch programming for far too long

[10:51:58] <k8yun> I recently have transitioned into managing and administering Azure clouds stuff - infra and etc. and my work scope has a bit extended into Azure DevOps.  It got me interested in .net to really learn.
[10:52:01] <ki9a> A task is a promise of a value (or void)
[10:52:27] <ki9a> so it either has one, or can be waited for/resumed on later.

[10:56:22] <k8yun> I guess the real reason why I want to go through a basic understanding is that I want to dockerize a legacy asp.net application into .net core.
[10:56:39] <k8yun> but to do that I want to go through at least the basics.
[10:56:42] <MatthiasVance> Why do you want to use docker?
[10:56:42] <MaNa3k> ki9a, yes i agree with that it isnt easy to test external services

[10:57:34] <Nasp> That sounds like a long journey if it's aspx
[10:57:43] <ki9a> k8yun: Afaik there's no 1:1 conversion of aspx to .net core
[10:57:52] <Nasp> MaNa3k: but you can make tests for parsing and all other logic
[10:58:03] <Nasp> Also did you have an actual specification
[10:58:08] <k8yun> cheaper to manage multiple instances b/c we are using one vm per application
[10:58:28] <Nasp> k8yun: you do realize that's a complete rewrite?
[10:58:31] <MatthiasVance> k8yun: I think using cloud-native technologies might even be cheaper?
[10:58:36] <MatthiasVance> k8yun: And less overhead

[11:15:41] <Inge> "An excellent 2014 IBM research paper “An Updated Performance Comparison of Virtual Machines and Linux Containers” by Felter et al. provides a comparison between bare metal, KVM, and Docker containers. The general result is: Docker is nearly identical to native performance and faster than KVM in every category."
[11:15:44] <MaNa3k> we are basically just pushing stuff to azure via visual studio publish, without docker, we just make the azure service we need
[11:16:08] <Inge> sure, nothing wrong with that
[11:16:26] <Inge> and make sure you tie your app up to every service offering they have, so you can never move away from Azure again :D

[14:47:52] <Babbage> hey
[14:58:48] <Tobbi_> morning, peasants.
[14:58:59] <Tobbi_> My corona warning app showed me that someone was positive in my vicinity.
[14:59:05] <Tobbi_> But, luckily, I'm not
[15:04:02] <jmer> Any suggestions on what to use to automatically test/verify our REST endpoints?
[15:04:15] <Tobbi_> DDoS
[15:13:09] * jmer slaps Tobbi_  with ap5's sock
[15:13:15] <Tobbi_> :D
[15:13:18] <Tobbi_> yuck
[15:14:51] <ap5> jmer, we use WebApplicationFactory  to make zeh functional tests
[15:18:02] <jmer> ap5: From "inside" the REST API ?
[15:18:23] <ap5> jmer, and JMeter actaully grew on me at IMPACT. I used to use it with groovy. Pretty strong
[15:18:41] <jmer> I just want to verify we didn't break the data contract atm
[15:18:46] <jmer> JMeter.. isn't that for perf stuff?
[15:18:50] <ap5> jmer, spin the webapi up in memory, and the you get a HttpClient for it that you can use
[15:19:05] <jmer> ap5: I was hoping for a tool that I can give to our business consultants
[15:19:07] <ap5> jmer, it is, but you can also create complex testing scenarios
[15:19:15] <jmer> hmm.
[15:19:47] <ap5> But maybe that is to complex for the consultants
[15:19:51] <jmer> I think we're far away from being able to spin up our API with in memory test data
[15:21:18] <ap5> You would not do it with in memory test data, but use docker-compose to spin up fx a database, and maybe mock out some other stuff (you can hook into the IoC pipeline with webapplicationfactory)
[15:21:41] <ap5> But for business consultants ... Then it have to be a pretty UI
[15:22:14] <jmer> yeeaaaah...
[15:22:21] <jmer> us getting on some container tech is still far off
[15:23:02] <jmer> prototyping/pilot projects with Redhat OpenShift is slowly kicking off in this new year...
[15:24:13] <ap5> I dont have anything with pretty UI. I can see what you want, but i dont know any products for that
[15:24:42] <jmer> one of the QA'ers used Postman and some js to automatically verify the endpoint's data contracts
[15:24:52] <jmer> but... man I would hate  being stuck with maintaining that...
[15:26:05] <ap5> The testers at IMPACT uses postman. The smart thing is that you can host your test definitions in zeh cloud and then everyone has access to it
[15:26:45] <jmer> but only if you PAY for postman
[15:26:59] <jmer> I applied for SemanticMerge november last year and they still haven't approved it xD

[16:54:16] <Suchiman> jmer: do you not have ShareX :P ?
[16:55:08] <kobo> with ef, in your .Select(x => new model....) is it possible to extract some of the mappings and still have it not execute the sql?

[16:55:49] <kobo> wasnt that wonderfully exlained by me....

[16:56:43] <Suchiman> kobo: you wanna get the Expression tree that expresses the object initializer of the select statement?
[16:57:30] <kobo> Suchiman, I can do it like this: https://pastebin.com/SKCuRBtm
[16:58:25] <kobo> But if i'd like to exract line 3-7 to a separate method, and keeping it wihtout executing the sql (until i await it)
[16:58:34] <peterR``> hmm, basic question, would you use async foreach to do this? https://gist.github.com/Ams627/3a643702c08395bdaea6d2dc65894795
[16:58:44] <peterR``> it's a very contrived example - I am just experimenting
[16:59:50] <Kim^J> kobo: IIRC it can't inspect stuff if you use a method
[17:00:09] <Suchiman> kobo: but you explicitly don't want to extract all of it, for example that part order => new OrderResult
[17:00:14] <kobo> so there's no way to split it up?
[17:00:45] <kobo> https://pastebin.com/2FVdrKja this is what I want
[17:01:05] <kobo> but when I do that, and the "MapToCustomer" would then execute the sql to fetch the "order" which I kinda get, but is there some way around it?
[17:01:14] <Kim^J> peterR``: 41-42 :(
[17:01:39] <kobo> I still want the benefits of deferred execution with EF
[17:01:57] <Suchiman> kobo: there is, all the compiler is doing is constructing an expression tree, you can rewrite the expression tree to inline stuff and make it work with EF, but that's non trivial amount of work
[17:02:40] <kobo> Alright.. so I guess I'll keep going with what I have now, that's a bummer
[17:03:11] <ap5> ANybody here worked with Google Cloud Storage, and knows how to do pagination? Say "give me page 4 only"?
[17:03:38] <kobo> is there any better to avoid having to write all this everytime then?  Firstname = order.Customer != null ? order.order.Customer.Firstname : null,
[17:03:52] <kobo> normal coalsecing with order?.Customer? doesn't work with expression trees it seems like
[17:04:09] <Suchiman> kobo: if this is translated into SQL, then remember that in SQL, there's no such thing as NullReferenceException
[17:04:20] <peterR``> Kim^J - what about it? Those lines are bad?
[17:04:27] <Suchiman> kobo: i might be a bit rusty but i think it behaves like order?.Customer?.... by default
[17:04:36] <kobo> yeah but Suchiman, if I don't have that it throws a npe :P
[17:05:00] <Suchiman> kobo: and that's IQueryable kind of Select?
[17:05:11] <kobo> yep
