[01:30:24] <[Coke]> is there a way to get a trace? I have a script that is just stopping at some point, would love to see what it's doing before it stops. (--ll-exception shows nothing)
[01:35:22] <MasterDuke> add a nqp::sin right before it stops, break on that in gdb, then run `call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)`
[01:36:46] <[Coke]> ... I don't know where it's stopping
[01:36:50] <[Coke]> that's what I'm trying to find out. :)

[12:05:38] <jaguart> In a Grammar - is it possible to use a changing quantifier that is captured within the regex? E.g. given: "s:3:abc;s:5:defgh" I want to do something like token str { 's:' $<num>=[\d+] ';' $<content> = [ . ** { $<num>} ] } so that $<content> is set to "abc" and "defgh" respectively?
[12:08:02] <jaguart> The $<content> captures can contain any chars - quotes, newlines etc. so I really want to extract by quantifier, and the char-count is considered reliable.
[12:17:26] <MasterDuke> m: say "a3bbbc" ~~ /a(\d)b**{$0}c/; say "a3bbc" ~~ /a(\d)b**{$0}c/; say "a3bbbbc" ~~ /a(\d)b**{$0}c/
[12:17:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar ee232c02b: OUTPUT: «｢a3bbbc｣␤ 0 => ｢3｣␤Nil␤Nil␤»

[12:36:21] <dsad> can anyone help me?
[12:36:38] <dsad> I have school presentation of Raku
[12:36:43] <dsad> and i need some help
[12:39:04] <lizmat> the school presentation is about the programming language Raku ?

[12:41:26] <dsad> yes
[12:41:29] <dsad> lizmat
[12:41:31] <lizmat> Cool
[12:41:39] <lizmat> so what would you want / need ?
[12:43:16] <dsad> i would like to know about most important features of raku
[12:43:25] <dsad> for example
[12:43:54] <dsad> like if its open source
[12:43:58] <dsad> and anything like that
[12:44:01] <dsad> just basics
[12:45:04] <lizmat> If you don't know whether Raku is open source, then I suggest you do a little more home work, like visiting https://raku.org  and come back here if you have more questions :-)
[12:47:32] <dsad> im very bad at english
[12:47:42] <dsad> thats my only source
[12:47:47] <dsad> the original raku website
[12:47:52] <lizmat> what is your native language?
[12:48:03] <dsad> finnish
[12:48:16] <dsad> finsih
[12:48:19] <dsad> finish
[12:48:58] <lizmat> ah, hmmm... that's still missing from https://raku.guide  :-(
[12:50:38] <lizmat> perhaps the english version of raku.guide would be helpful for your school project?
[12:50:59] <dsad> All i know its similar to perl ruby smalltalk haskell javascript and its for scripting web dev and managing different texts
[12:51:11] <dsad> well i will look at it
[12:52:20] <dsad> how can i access to raku by my own hands?
[12:52:28] <dsad> visual studio?
[12:52:46] <lizmat> if you like IDE's, you should probably download the community version of https://commaide.com
[13:36:23] <dsad> hmm i dont get raku running on that
[13:36:27] <dsad> idk

[20:50:12] <tellable6> 2022-02-10T14:21:31Z #raku <tbrowder> tonyo that was yesterday at about 1102 CDT
[20:53:32] <tbrowder> emacs? lisp
[20:53:34] <tellable6> 2022-02-10T02:22:16Z #raku <tonyo> tbrowder finally got cro to install and will start working on that tut 
[20:54:32] <tonyo> lisp is most likely

[21:18:41] <timo> give the newest JSON::Fast a go, everyone
[21:19:30] <tbrowder> okey dokey
[21:20:17] <lizmat> timo : I guess we need to wait for about an hour
[21:20:26] <lizmat> it's not in the ecosystem yet
[21:20:59] <timo> ah, coming very soon to a cpan mirror and cpan content listing near you
[21:21:04] <lizmat> it will be in the REA in a few minutes
[21:21:19] <lizmat> actually, did you know that there are no CPAN mirrors anymore?
[21:21:35] <lizmat> there's just a single load-balanced / distributed URL nowadays, afaik
[21:22:21] <timo> OK, so less a loose network of mirrored servers with perhaps different update frequencies, more a CDN like thing 
[21:26:40] <lizmat> yup, a CDN
[21:28:26] <timo> CDAN
[21:29:30] <japhb> timo: What's new in the newest JSON::Fast?
[21:29:42] <lizmat> :immutable
[21:30:06] <lizmat> + the ability to specify defaults for to-json and from-json
[21:30:13] <lizmat> in the use statement
[21:30:39] <lizmat> and 1% faster overall, and 9% faster for the immutable version (with a smaller memory footprint)
[21:30:44] <lizmat> dinner&
[21:30:49] <japhb> Nice

[23:23:26] * [Coke] wonders if anyone here has a CMS they have to deal with as part of their $DAYJOB
[23:27:38] <jdv> not these days, no.  used to be the lead dev on one a while ago.

[23:42:47] <[Coke]> ok, retried my windows issue with raku-latest; still broken. 'nmake test' was fine, so no obvious raku failures there.
[23:43:59] <[Coke]> will zef nuke remove everything installed?
[23:44:11] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg
[23:44:42] <[Coke]> or rather: how I nuke all installed modules so I can start fresh?
[23:45:12] <[Coke]> ah, need to specify all three?
[23:46:54] <[Coke]> oops. now getting: bash: /c/raku/share/perl6/site/bin/zef: No such file or directory
[23:47:29] <[Coke]> ah. rehashing command list now can't find zef on command line either, which is what I wanted, nevermind. :)
