[06:14:33] <BrenBarn> yeah
[06:14:45] <BrenBarn> I mean it can make sense in some cases where what you're doing is really optional
[06:15:04] <maxtim> mekhami, does it at least log why the thing couldn't work?
[06:15:05] <BrenBarn> or if it's a top-level handler that logs everything so a server process doesn't crash or something

[06:18:30] <BrenBarn> initializing the QApplication is required

[07:17:55] <fluter> so this syntax of constructing object is deprecated in 3.8?
[07:17:57] <habnabit_> fluter, are you not using any automatic syntax conversion?
[07:18:11] <fluter> habnabit_: hmmm, no, i'm using vim
[07:18:16] <fluter> not auto correction
[07:18:34] <habnabit_> fluter, i mean like https://python-future.org/futurize.html
[07:18:56] <habnabit_> fluter, if you have python 2 code, use futurize
[07:19:08] <fluter> oh, ok
[07:19:23] <habnabit_> fluter, mechanically porting the syntax is annoying
[07:19:45] <fluter> yeah i should use futurize, there might be other old stuff need to change too

[12:58:44] <MikachuPi> Hi, is there a way to use an ast object as a condition for a `for` loop ? (something like for some_eval_function_thingy(ast) ?)

[13:00:01] <MikachuPi> For now the easiest way I've found is to convert my whole `for` block as an ast and insert the ast for the condition inside, but It's really tedious

[13:04:15] <Luyin> graingert: if I understand it correctly, I can just dump my tox.ini into the pyproject.toml like you did in the file you referenced; https://github.com/PyCQA/modernize/blob/master/pyproject.toml#L73 do I still run "python -m tox" afterwards? or do I run something else?
[13:04:48] <graingert> Luyin: I use pipx run tox
[13:05:03] <graingert> But you can invoke tox however you are used to
[13:05:31] <Luyin> ok so I do still invoke tox, that's what I wanted to know :D thanks
[13:05:42] <Luyin> pipx is from pipenv or something?

[14:23:05] <MikachuPi> nedbat: cause the a can be used in other parts of the code inside the loop

[22:04:03] <SnoopJ> might be possible in the API proposed in PEP 523?

[22:04:37] <acresearch> nedbat: i see
[22:04:48] <habnabit_> acresearch, also f-strings can't be templated dynamically, which is why str:format is still useful
[22:04:54] <nedbat> catern: there might be other ways to solve the problem you are trying to solve.

[22:05:14] <SnoopJ> zware, extremely minor, but it does emit less bytecode, yea.

[22:07:17] <habnabit_> acresearch, there's no way to tell python 'interpret this string as if it were an f-string'
[22:07:27] <catern> nedbat: perhaps for individual cases, but no alternative would be fully general. for example, if one wanted to write some configuration: you could disallow the use of functions in the configuration, by throwing on function defintion.
[22:07:31] <habnabit_> acresearch, what i'm saying is pretty compact; how would an article be shorter?
[22:07:44] *** Joins: goldfish (~goldfish@user/goldfish)
[22:07:58] <SnoopJ> acresearch, f-strings must be evaluated immediately and the named values are looked up from the surrounding scope. str.format() lets you hold onto the template string as a separate piece of data, and you can pass in arbitrary data for each field.
[22:08:04] <nedbat> catern: ah, i remember this discussion.  a trace function can do a lot.
[22:08:07] <acresearch> habnabit_: SnoopJ ok
[22:08:27] <habnabit_> (and str:format doesn't evaluate expressions, but f-strings do)

[23:38:22] <yates> then what is the [target_os][target_arch]?

[23:38:56] <yates> ok thanks SnoopJ
[23:39:01] <yates> and nedbat
[23:39:18] <SnoopJ> presumably machine_dict() returns a dict that has `target_os` as a key and the corresponding value is a dict with `target_arch`
