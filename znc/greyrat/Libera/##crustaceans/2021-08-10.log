[02:59:57] <drakonis> OH YES.
[03:00:04] <cb> jjba looks so homoerotic to me
[03:00:14] <drakonis> isnt that the point?
[03:00:24] <cb> doesnt help a guy i know who was super into it claimed he was bi but was very uncomfortable around women
[03:00:39] <cb> dude also did nothing but play morrowind
[03:00:42] <drakonis> lmao
[03:00:47] <cb> and he always wore suits
[03:00:54] <drakonis> morrowind is very homoerotic
[03:01:01] <drakonis> did he never read any of the books involving vivec?
[03:01:09] <cb> the first time i met him was he was vaping at the front door of campus
[03:01:14] <drakonis> lmao
[03:01:14] <cb> he was super into TES lore
[03:01:21] <drakonis> that is very weird
[03:01:28] <drakonis> tes3 is very fuckin weird
[03:02:09] <drakonis> but i want to see part 7 next
[03:02:39] <drakonis> anyhow i feel very called out
[03:02:43] <drakonis> but i dont wear suits
[03:05:16] <drakonis> i like jojos and morrowind

[03:49:28] <goodger[m]> gayer than most gay porn
[03:49:29] <manicennui> yes
[03:49:47] <manicennui> Hmm.
[03:50:16] <manicennui> Because of the way they look or something?
[04:09:31] <indigo> > In an alternate timeline's 1890, United States President Funny Valentine holds a cross-country horse race with a $50 million reward to the winner. Valentine intends to use the race to gather the scattered parts of a holy corpse for his own nationalistic ends. Racers Gyro Zeppeli and Johnny Joestar uncover Valentine's ploy and must defend themselves from his hired assassins.

[04:34:44] <Church> goodger[m]: But those muscles.
[04:34:54] <Church> I'd go gay for that
[04:42:16] <skyl4rk> memes is my looking-glass exclusively, but my take on jjba is that everyone is always angry or sulking, possibly because their extaravagant clothing is not extravagant enough?, and that conflicts are resolved through high-stakes dance-offs between the combatants' animas? spirit animal/person/??
[04:42:49] <skyl4rk> also everybody's faces are drawn with some sort of contour/shading that brings out all the angles
[04:42:55] <skyl4rk> ...how far off am I?
[05:40:03] <drakonis> it depends on which part you're checking out
[05:40:37] <drakonis> as the series progresses, the fights become puzzles that have to be solved with each stand power
[05:40:51] <drakonis> and less so about punch ghost fights
[05:41:57] <drakonis> part 6 has the most plot of the series so far

[21:59:42] <goodger[m]> I played Duke Nukem 3D for the first time yesterday, coincidentally
[21:59:58] <manicennui> Although CEO Bobby Kotick has promised that Activision Blizzard "will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry," employees and industry observers remain skeptical.
[22:00:02] <manicennui> Why would anyone believe this?
[22:00:22] <manicennui> When I worked at UHG they would constantly feed us bullshit like this, and some people believed it. I don't get it.
[22:00:26] <bkero> They have a track record of delivering in the past
[22:00:32] <bkero> Where delivering meant video games that (some) people enjoy.
[22:01:01] <manicennui> Sorry, this is specifically about their culture.

[22:27:44] <Brekkjern> I need to see season 3 or whatever of JJBA
[22:28:00] <Brekkjern> I saw the first two parts on Netflix. Shit was great
[22:30:08] <drakonis> hmm
[22:30:34] <drakonis> part 1 is phantom blood and part 2 is battle tendency
[22:30:40] <drakonis> which is anime season 1
[22:31:07] <Brekkjern> First season on Netflix is the origin story of JoJo and Dio
[22:31:08] <drakonis> season 2 is part 3: stardust crusaders and season 3 is part 4: diamond is unbreakable
[22:31:28] <ngoldbaum> how anime is jjba?
[22:31:34] <Brekkjern> Hella anime
[22:31:35] <drakonis> its the root of all anime
[22:31:37] <cb> aggressively so
[22:31:41] <Brekkjern> Just embrace it
[22:31:46] <Brekkjern> It's part of the point
[22:31:48] <cb> ive only been exposed to it second hand
[22:31:52] <ngoldbaum> doubt fiance would like it
[22:31:55] <drakonis> you can feel its influences on so much media
[22:32:07] <drakonis> its very anime but not the usual fare
[22:32:17] <drakonis> do you like the persona games?
[22:32:48] <Brekkjern> JJBA is not the weeb type of anime, but the EVERYTHING IS EXXAGERATED TO ABSURD COMEDIC EFFECT type of anime
[22:32:53] <Brekkjern> And it's fucking great
[22:36:08] <Brekkjern> Can recommend One Punch Man as well
[22:36:34] <Brekkjern> But I don't think it should be one of the first animes one watches
[22:36:48] <drakonis> one punch man is also pretty good
[22:37:03] <drakonis> however its pretty satirical, so to say
