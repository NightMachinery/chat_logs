[15:41:27] <LucasCrijns[m]> Maybe this article is of interest: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html?m=1  
[15:41:27] <LucasCrijns[m]> It explains one of the most sophisticated zero-click exploits

[16:20:43] <Notkea> I want some VHDL -> JBIG2 conversion tool
[16:25:21] <LucasCrijns[m]> What is VHDL? Is that another compression format for PDF's?
[16:38:39] <afontain[m]> Is this VHDL the language to program FPGA?
[16:50:51] <Notkea> hardware description language, which can compile to something like logic gates circuits, which can then be embedded in the JBIG2-compressed files like they did. They might have done exactly that, because it would be a pain to do that by hand
[16:55:55] <LucasCrijns[m]> They probably did, as creating a virtual architecture by hand is undoable without some tools for the job
[16:56:39] <Notkea> would be funny if they just used an ARM licence
[17:03:42] <LucasCrijns[m]> I think that the ARM architecture would probably have been too complex for them. Maybe a RISC-like architecture
[17:28:07] <typedef[m]> Now I want to find a paper named "Using RISC-V for remote code execution" or something similar
