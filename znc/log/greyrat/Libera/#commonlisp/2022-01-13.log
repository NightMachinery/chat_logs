[01:10:36] <phoe> I have a possibly cyclic graph data structure that I would like to get a modified copy of, where "modified copy" means that I'd like some of the nodes to be different, and also that I want not to mutate the original, and also that I want to maximize structure sharing wherever possible. Is anyone aware of any Lisp code that will help me do that?
[01:11:06] <etimmons> I can't work on it for a bit, but I've got a connection pool built on top of drakma. I'm working to get it pulled out into a sensible library and also married with schannel for TLS on Windows
[01:11:28] <phoe> a simple example of what I'd like to do is turning (1 2 3 . #1=(4 5)) into (1 2 :three . #1#)
[01:11:42] <theothornhill> phoe: FSet? Sounds like a persistent data structure, doesn't it?
[01:11:47] <etimmons> When it's in a clean-ish state, I'm planning to reach out to see if it should be incorporated into drakma itself or live as a wrapper around it
[01:11:55] <Josh_2> In this case there is a serious chance that I will be making a lot of HTTP requests (webhooks) to listeners
[01:12:01] <phoe> a slightly more involved one is turning #1=(1 2 3 4 5 . #1#) into #2=(1 2 :three 4 5 . #2#) because then everything needs to be copied due to a cycle
[01:12:31] <phoe> theothornhill: yes, except the catch is, I'd like to use standard Lisp data structures for the nodes - conses, vectors, standard objects
[01:12:41] <phoe> hence it sounds more like a GF protocol to participate in if anything
[01:13:05] <phoe> also I have no idea if fset permits cycles

[01:33:26] <phoe> part one: I want to make a part of the whole graph "fresh", where the part involves making a shallow copy of everything between some root vertex of the graph and one or more "target" vertices that I want to mutate in part two

[02:46:37] <sveit_> Hi. I saw a statement that "displaced arrays perform poorly" here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40810796/displaced-multidimensional-arrays-in-common-lisp#comment68846900_40810796 . Is someone here familiar with why this would be true?
[02:47:31] <sveit_> The reason I ask is that it is of course fairly simple to just implement an additional object that can store information on the "view" I'd like to provide on a flat array (as suggested in that comment) but why would my user-space implementation be better than what is in the compiler?
[02:47:58] <Bike> well, it kind of wouldn't be
[02:48:07] <Bike> which is why they usually perform poorly
[02:48:30] <sveit_> (in case it's not claer, that link is directly to the comment by someone named Dan Robertson that has the statement i'm confused about)
[02:49:15] <Bike> so the problem is, say we have (aref a ...) in the code. if the compiler knows a is NOT displaced, that's pretty straightforward - bounds check and a memory read
[02:49:36] <Bike> but if it could be displaced, it has to compile in a check for that, and then code to loop through displacements to get the underlying array
[02:50:01] <Bike> with what the comment describes, you'd have one simple vector which can be accessed quickly, and then you just briefly compute the index you actually want
[02:50:36] <mfiano> Implementations just don't optimize everything they could.
[02:50:50] <mfiano> On SBCL at least, bounds checking occurs on both
[02:51:03] <sveit_> Bike: i think you have revealed that I don't understand what array displacement means :) I thought it was exactly what you described in your last statement: a backing vector and some new procedure for computing indices
[02:51:20] <Bike> sveit_: the trick is that you can displace to another array that is itself displaced
[02:51:38] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[02:52:52] <sveit_> Bike: sure, but doesn't the procedure "close" on itself? meaning if A0 is the original array, A1 is displaced to A0, and A2 is displaced to A1, can't the implementation just treat A2 as displaced to A0?
[02:53:13] <Bike> no, because the array-displacement function allows you get at the underlying array
[02:53:17] <Bike> clhs array-displacement
[02:53:17] <specbot> http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_ar_dis.htm
[02:53:43] <Bike> and, for example, if A1 is adjusted, A2 needs to reflect that adjustment, even if A0 itself has not changed
[02:56:36] <sveit_> Bike: ah, thank you very much, this makes a lot more sense now.
[02:57:10] <Bike> think the standards committee should have put a little more thought into this thing, honestly
[03:00:22] <Catie> Adjusting a displaced array is something they actually put a decent bit of thought into, there's an issue writeup about it

[03:26:13] <aeth> if the problem is the function ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT, and someone really wanted to optimize displaced arrays, couldn't they just optimize them if ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT cannot possibly show up in the program?
[03:26:30] <aeth> couldn't really do that in current implementations, but maybe in a conforming one
[03:27:48] <Bike> did you read the message i wrote after that one
[03:27:54] <_death> Bike: what about keeping both the immediate displacement and the farthest one possible, and recomputing the latter when needed
[03:28:13] <Bike> yeah i guess you could have each array maintain weak backpointers to every array that's displaced to it
[03:28:33] <Bike> to trigger the recomputation
[03:31:11] <Bike> aeth: and for the record, it's more or less impossible (in general, actually impossible, for computability reasons) for a compiler to determine that some function will never be called, in a world where any function could be redefined to do (eval (read))
[03:32:41] <aeth> Bike: you do something like what JITs do... you are prepared to deoptimize if necessary. Easier task than JITs because you'd only need to do it on the equivalent of C-c C-c or C-c C-k

[16:45:27] <VincentVega> How does SBCL decide when to call a compiler macro? I am trying some examples from CLHS define-compiler-macro and the original function is called.
[16:45:56] <phoe> VincentVega: which example?
[16:46:03] <VincentVega> the square one
[16:47:23] <phoe> all examples up to (funcall (compiler-macro-function 'square) '(funcall #'square x) nil) work as expected
[16:48:34] <VincentVega> yeah, but (square 3) keeps calling the original function definition
[16:48:53] <phoe> (macroexpand '(square x)) =>  (SQUARE X), false
[16:49:10] <phoe> that's from the examples
[16:49:36] <phoe> and how do you know it keeps calling the original function definition?
[16:49:42] <VincentVega> http://ix.io/3M4g this keeps printing hmmm
[16:50:10] <beach> VincentVega: As I recall, the OPTIMIZE values may determine whether the compiler macro is called.
[16:50:24] <VincentVega> beach: thanks, I'll try that
[16:50:43] <phoe> yes - (sb-ext:restrict-compiler-policy)
[16:50:46] <phoe> uh sorry
[16:50:51] <phoe> (sb-ext:describe-compiler-policy)
[16:52:13] <VincentVega> phoe: interesting summary, thanks
[16:52:53] <phoe> VincentVega: and check the SBCL manual for optimization qualities, maybe some high DEBUG or something can cause SBCL to not use compiler macros
[16:54:27] <phoe> ...welp, the manual does not seem to mention that!
[16:54:48] <phoe> #sbcl might provide more information, or the devs could write something in the manual about how CMs are treated
[16:56:37] <VincentVega> phoe: thanks! I will probably ask there. http://ix.io/3M4h optimization options didn't turn out to have an effect.
[17:01:39] <VincentVega> oh, nevermind, top-level compiling it was the reason. Putting it in a function definition works out just fine.

[21:24:27] <jackdaniel> btw there is an interesting history behind "mixins" and "flavors" (so I've read somewhere) - there was an icecream shop on the campus where they were invented
[21:24:58] <jackdaniel> and they had this service, that they had a basic flavor and allowed to have a mixin - so you had a "vanilla" icecream with a "strawberry" mixin
[21:24:58] <rotateq> yes two physicists got the idea for naming it that way at that ^^

[22:07:20] <lisp123> rotateq: nice
[22:07:46] <rotateq> like how doing it "cleverly" when it gets "wall is you" and you become multiple objects at once
[22:08:46] <rotateq> and it gets me to think more and more, without CLOS capabilities, how do they even do it in Lua without it becoming too messy? ^^ not to talk about more complex games
[22:09:57] <rotateq> and doing some simple sentence analysis
[22:10:23] <rotateq> or not calling it "simple", would be too naive, it's hard

[22:56:47] <lisp123> With sly, everytime I exit sly-db, it asks me whether I want to throw to the toplevel (y / n), is there a way to set this to y always?
[22:57:18] <phoe> how do you quit it?
[22:57:42] <lisp123> i press Q
[22:58:02] <lisp123> so I have to do Q y, which is 2x longer :(
[22:58:03] <phoe> I see - on Slime it simply invokes an ABORT restart
[22:58:15] <phoe> and that performs all the non-local exit stuff that is necessary
[22:58:17] <lisp123> Yeah Slime works well, this is just for Sly

[22:59:08] <phoe> TIL, thanks
[22:59:35] <lisp123> there's a clash between EVIL mode & Sly, so will need to fix that, but otherwise all good

[23:18:02] <Bike> say we had the code (let ((a (foo))) (map nil #'print a) (aref a 0)), and at some particular time FOO returned a list rather than a vector. how would people feel about an implementation that signaled a type error as soon as the list was returned, i.e. before doing the map?

[23:24:09] <Bike> that's how it usually works now. i'm asking how people would feel if it worked as in the hypothetical.

[23:28:49] <White_Flame> Bike: would that be because the type inference from aref hoisted up for the whole body?
[23:29:09] <White_Flame> eg a declaration on A
[23:29:38] <White_Flame> I think that would be the actual consequence of what "type inference" means.  It's about A itself
[23:30:42] <White_Flame> hmm, but those usually aren't errors, are they?
[23:31:14] <Bike> it would be inferring backwards from the fact that (aref a 0) is undefined unless a is a vector, yes
[23:32:31] <Bike> as far as i'm aware, no actual implementation does what i'm describing. they might issue a type warning at compile time if foo is declared to never return a vector, and probably signal an error from aref if it receives a non vector
[23:33:25] <White_Flame> with high safety and debug, are there runtime warnings when type declared bodies are entered with the wrong value type?

[23:46:23] <jeosol> Good morning guys!
[23:47:05] <jeosol> When writing a paper about CL, what is the canonical reference for CLOS in terms of reference citation

[23:50:20] *** Parts: thomaslewis (6e04fe5c02@mail.nobodyhasthe.biz) ()
[23:50:43] <NotThatRPG> jeosol: I think it depends on whether you want to give credit to the people who developed CLOS, or just point someone at an explanation of what CLOS Is.
[23:51:45] <jeosol> good point. But it's more as a reference too for people to understand what I am refering too. Lispers probably does but it's making adding reference appropriately

[23:52:29] <jeosol> I use SBCL primarily, so not sure if there is doc for SBCL CLOS(?) but I imagine since implementations are mostly compliant, I don't have to cite any specific to SBCL just that higher-level should cover everything
[23:53:13] <NotThatRPG> So if your readers are not familiar with CLOS the Keene book might be a better citation (or compromise and give both)

[23:58:52] <jeosol> Yeah, that's true. I was thinking of that too, hmm, good point.
[23:59:32] <jeosol> Keene's book was what I read front to back to understand CLOS so it is definitely useful, guess for non CL folks
[23:59:48] <jeosol> Thanks
