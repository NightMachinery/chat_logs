[04:52:46] <johncs> tricky thing to manually test, maybe they're not confident in the patch
[04:53:38] <johncs> i'd guess it will never be merged if they didn't say anything but merged a bunch of other patches
[04:54:10] <johncs> hard to know what to do without any feedback on it
[04:56:04] <johncs> ah actually the other PRs were very tiny. maybe they just had a moment, but not enough to actually take a look at my relatively more complex patch.

[16:29:16] <fnutt> I am fairly sure The Lounge does keep the text in input field when switching channels.
[16:29:42] *** Quits: jlanda77 (~jlanda@ansible/staff/jlanda) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:29:55] <fnutt> But it does not keep the text when switching clients (as in opening TL on another device or another web browser tab etc.).
[16:29:59] *** Joins: jlanda77 (~jlanda@ansible/staff/jlanda)
[16:30:35] <fnutt> It was implemented when TL was converted to Vue.js.
[16:32:16] <Snuupy> fnutt: yes it keeps it when switching channels, but not if you've closed out the session or restarted the computer
[16:33:57] <fnutt> Not sure if that's something you'd want to have.
[16:37:05] <xnaas> I concur Snuupy. Losing my message because thelounge (or iOS) can't handle network switches is awful. 
[16:37:22] <xnaas> I have Palaver for when I know thelounge isn't going to be able to service me. 🙃
[16:37:53] <chosi> mh, weird situation here. on ubuntu 20.04 - thelounge depends on nodejs >12, which is okay - but I still have the old nodejs package (10) installed, while using node 12 from /usr/local/bin - how do i resolve this peacefully between thelounge and the nodejs package? :>
[16:38:16] <bookworm> by installing a package that provides node12
[16:38:42] <bookworm> you're fighting apt, or well, dpkg not TL here
[16:38:56] <Snuupy> definitely something I'd want to have
[16:39:09] <bookworm> and that only sees stuff in its index, it doesn't give a damn about binaries it doesn't track
[16:39:10] <Snuupy> xnaas: palaver?
[16:39:23] <bookworm> Snuupy: --> offtopic
[16:41:17] <chosi> alright, done. now, last time i tried this failed:
[16:41:31] <chosi> dpkg: warning: unable to delete old directory '/usr/lib/node_modules/thelounge/node_modules/isarray': Directory not empty

[16:42:00] <chosi> i ran into this issue too: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4374 - could this be related?
[16:42:29] <bookworm> no, you have a different problem still
[16:43:00] <bookworm> in theory, dpkg should have tracked files it installed, did you sudo npm install thelounge at one point?
[16:43:01] <chosi> i solved the dependency one
[16:43:07] <bookworm> that looks like it
[16:43:29] <chosi> that issue is not mine, but same thing happened. i just dpkg -i'ed the 4.3 deb

[16:45:20] <chosi> no manual npm install thelounge in my bash history :>
[16:45:27] <bookworm> so, apt purge thelounge to remove the tracked files, then manually clean up
