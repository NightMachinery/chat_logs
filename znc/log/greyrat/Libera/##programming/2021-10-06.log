[02:17:08] <flaknet99> 10 million is quite a lot when there are only 65K ports available, once you go over that it's just duct taping in fixes

[07:29:36] <noircode> too bad I don't have an account at that bank (it was a sms message)
[07:30:51] <pulse> i wonder how many people fall for that whole saudi prince scheme
[07:30:57] <InPhase> I was uncertain about that Paypal one the first time I got one of those a very long time ago, as the first one I got was formatted pretty well.  I did the correct thing and logged in directly from my own link, and Paypal had no knowledge of the issue.  Then I knew never to waste time on one of those again.
[07:31:01] <pulse> i deleted at least a few of those the other day
[07:31:15] <pulse> i bet some people fall for it, but they're too ashamed to admit and it never comes out
[07:31:54] <pulse> InPhase, the one that i just got had very tiny problems like weird spelling and language, something i pick up easily
[07:31:58] <pulse> but i don't think most people would
[07:32:05] <pulse> most people would assume it's legit probably
[07:32:18] <pulse> and if the phishing site is convincing enough, most people would fall for that too
[07:32:31] <noircode> I've always wondered how people make money on spam, but it must be working if they are still doing it
[07:32:48] <pulse> i mean i'm assuming a bit but from my experience the vast majority of non-techie people in the real world are very, very poorly educated on online security issues
[07:33:08] <InPhase> noircode: It does not require a high rate of return.  A very small number of people falling for it funds the whole thing.
[07:33:20] <pulse> yeah especially if you're doing it globally
[07:33:29] <InPhase> It's just too cheap to send a huge amount of emails.

[07:45:14] <Decker> Hi - I have some challenges for yous 
[07:45:50] <Decker> how to - make an array of 24 lines from points around a circle all point at some x/y in the circle?
[07:46:28] <pulse> with cos and sin :p
[07:46:36] <InPhase> and then the line equation.
[07:46:37] <flaknet99> angles n junk
[07:46:47] <Decker> (the lines are all perpedicular to the circle at angle 0 and the yaw can be controlled
[07:47:22] <Decker> so they point at the center ... ya but then they have to each have their own name too... can't like make one script for each of them to run with an offset
[07:47:27] <Decker> (well maybe I could)
[07:48:26] <Decker> I got sorta lost in this Starbase game- they have rangefinders that return distance - works for pracitcal things like asteroid avoidance, and approach for minining... lasers and turrets have pitch and yaw variables you can control and current values you can read
[07:48:55] <Decker> but it's like basic, and I don't think there's 'and' or 'or' so you sorta hve to use * and + on the expressions

[08:05:22] <InPhase> Samian: "para-" meaning to the side, "-metric" meaning a measure, or value representing a thing.  So a "parametric" thing has auxillary measures to the side which accompany it.

[08:06:01] <PlanckWalk> A circle defined as the set of all (x,y) such that x^2 + y^2 = 1 isn't parametric: there is no free parameter there to vary.
[08:06:17] <pulse> actually i'm wrong to just associate it with circles, any kind of geometric shape can basically be represented as parametric equations
[08:06:55] <flaknet99> decker if you draw a giant plus, thats like a circle with four points, then all you need to do is rotate it 45 degree for 8 points
[08:06:56] <InPhase> Samian: Thus to "parameterize" means to put the measures to the side of the thing, which in programming implies making them things which can be externally altered.
[08:06:56] <PlanckWalk> Defining it as in terms of (cos(t), sin(t)) is parametric: you can put whatever value for t in you like, and get a point on the circle.

[11:06:49] <ExeciN> Hi people. I have a 256 bits as my entropy and using 7 of them as a uint7. I later realized that the presicion of 1/127 (≈0.008) is not good enough. so instead of using a uint16 for example I prefer to use the extra bits to add decimals (like a fixed point).
[11:07:16] <Decker> ok
[11:07:43] <ExeciN> This brings a different set of problems. How can I keep the original 7 bits used while adding decimals with the extra 9 (as an example) bits and still keeping the value between 0 and 127?
[11:09:32] <ExeciN> so previous uint7 values would differ by a max of ±0.5
[11:09:48] <Decker> 1 bit
[11:10:41] <ExeciN> I want to fuzz the original uint7 values using extra bits
[11:10:50] <ExeciN> I don't want completely different values

[16:17:39] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Under YAGNI you write what you need when you need it, under the premise that in most cases there's no value to writing things ahead of time just in case, if it's the same amount of work to write them under the scenario that you actually do need it.
[16:17:42] <Kake> InPhase: So you define a model by programming it? 
[16:18:01] <[itchyjunk]> InPhase, ah that makes sense
[16:18:12] <mrig> perhaps maya has better defaults for lighting or makes it more intuitive.
[16:18:18] <DnzAtWrk> oh come on
[16:18:20] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: It's not a hard rule, because there are cases where a class is complicated and toString might be easier to know how to write when it's fresh in mind.  But if, for example, you're making a coordinate class...  I bet you can figure it out real quick when you need it.

[16:45:35] <pulse> yes, the OST might be better on Skyrim side

[16:53:14] <merijn> pulse: Those are also pretty good in that (like D:OS2) they're *roleplaying* games where they actually make sure there's multiple valid solutions to obstacles/problems
[16:53:38] <pulse> themepark is often contrasted against sandbox
[16:53:46] <pulse> but best RPGs combine those two
[16:53:52] <pikapika> pulse, and as I said, in order to avoid it, you will have to have a lot of combinatorial explosion in the events and plots
[16:53:58] <pulse> minecraft is a sandbox for example
[16:53:58] <merijn> pulse: They (Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall/Hong Kong) are all pretty good
[16:54:00] <pikapika> unless you want to severly railroad the game
[16:54:00] <pulse> whereas skyrim is themepark
[16:54:15] <pulse> pikapika, which is exactly why the world has to be small
[16:54:18] <pikapika> or make the choices really short term to enforce orthogonality (in effect reverting to carnival)
[16:54:23] <pulse> modern games make the mistake of having a vast, shallow world
[16:54:26] <pikapika> pulse, and which is another thing
[16:54:27] <pulse> when it should be small and deep
[16:54:35] <pikapika> A small world also in a sense becomes anti thetical to open world concept
[16:54:39] <DnzAtWrk> worst thing about cycles is that it renders so slowly
[16:54:39] <pikapika> So its a very difficult line to walk
[16:54:42] <merijn> pulse: The key element that sets them apart from other RPGs (I think) is that Shadowrun is originally a pen&paper RPG and that the studio that made those three was founded by the guy who designed the original pen&paper game
[16:54:45] <pulse> it's easier to make a vast and shallow open world than it is to make a small one with proper depth
[16:54:56] <pulse> pikapika, no, you'd think so but no
[16:55:02] <merijn> pulse: And thus they pay more attention to things beyond just "combat & stats"
[16:55:06] <pulse> there's nothing about open world that requires a vast world
[16:55:08] <DnzAtWrk> a small world can be very open
[16:55:11] <DnzAtWrk> see: outer wilds
[16:55:11] <pulse> many open world games are small
[16:55:16] <pulse> gothic being my favorite example
[16:55:16] <pikapika> pulse, it really is. Just imagine if your open world was only as large as a csgo map
[16:55:23] <pulse> that's too small
[16:55:30] <pikapika> Scale is part of something being open world
[16:55:35] <pikapika> which is exactly what I meant to demonstrate

[16:55:43] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: outer wilds is pretty big, tbh :p
[16:55:50] <pulse> but imagine doing a GTA5 tier scale of the world
[16:55:54] <pikapika> pulse, so yeah its quite a tough line to walk
[16:55:58] <pulse> it's gonna be way too big to feel impactful
[16:56:02] <DnzAtWrk> outer wilds is only spatially big
[16:56:05] <pikapika> GTA is driving based so thats a moot point
[16:56:08] <DnzAtWrk> but it doesn't have too many real areas
[16:56:14] <pikapika> It is large but your transport is also fast
[16:56:31] <pikapika> Density is a function of character velocity
[16:56:37] <pulse> yes it has to be big due to that
[16:56:42] <merijn> btw
[16:56:54] <pulse> but my point was, it's incredibly hard to make that kind of a vast world feel impactful
[16:57:00] <pulse> if not impossible
[16:57:04] <DnzAtWrk> it works
[16:57:04] <pikapika> pulse, as I said. Its an extremely subtle thing.
[16:57:09] <DnzAtWrk> see fallout 3
[16:57:11] <DnzAtWrk> it's big
[16:57:14] <DnzAtWrk> but there is also tons of content
[16:57:24] <pulse> yeah but i didn't mean content with impactful
[16:57:30] <pikapika> There are three factors at play: scale, anti-themepark, anti-railroad and each works opposite to the others
[16:57:31] <DnzAtWrk> not if you don't care
[16:57:32] <pulse> i meant seeing the consequences of your actions
[16:57:37] <DnzAtWrk> but there is a lot of storytelling everywhere
[16:57:38] <merijn> If were talking games, lemme pitch an obscure and unique one
[16:57:41] <DnzAtWrk> if you pay attention
[16:57:44] *** Quits: Akronymus (~Akronymus@85.31.8.180) (Quit: Client closed)
[16:57:47] <pulse> that's what ultimately makes a world impactful. seeing how it changes through your actions
[16:57:55] <pikapika> pulse, having long term consequences of actions requires a lot of combinatorial plots
[16:57:58] <pulse> you can make that work in a small world, a big one will smudge all the differences
[16:58:01] <merijn> Heaven's Vault is a brilliantly unique game
[16:58:03] <pikapika> Which is the toughest thing
[16:58:37] <pikapika> You can "cheat" by making "rebases" of your actions after every so and so amount of events
[16:58:38] *** Quits: Joanna (uid57472@id-57472.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[16:58:46] <merijn> It's a bit rough (movement is very slow and the game tries to encourage multiple replays, but movement is kinda to sluggish to wanna do that)
[16:58:57] *** Joins: Guest3 (~textual@user/hcbt)
[16:59:07] <pikapika> but as I said, that effectively sacrifices long term for more quantity and orthogonality of events
[16:59:32] <pikapika> I'd say, elegant "rebasing" is also an art for sure
[16:59:35] <merijn> But it's unlike any other game I've played and the translation mechanic was super well done
[16:59:49] <pikapika> But it must be used with caution, because as I said it could railroad if its used wrongly

[17:02:03] <pikapika> MMO are a very different topic
[17:02:06] <merijn> pulse: I didn't in retail originally, but getting there now :p
[17:02:09] <pikapika> MMO has the lifer problem

[17:05:15] <pikapika> pulse, the thing is. The longer a game is in existence, the more it becomes tuned to lifer style gameplay.

[17:06:05] <pulse> merijn, i like the leveling experience most, and i avoid endgame

[17:22:34] <pulse> merijn, yes, and i bought that pitch :p
[17:22:42] <pulse> and i'm still salty about it
[17:22:48] <[itchyjunk]> if i have a private method, they cannot be accessed by the objects ?

[17:23:08] <DnzAtWrk> that's why too sharp
[17:23:09] <[itchyjunk]> Object object = new Object(); say. then object.privateMethod() wouldn't work?
[17:23:45] <CodePoint> [itchyjunk]: you have three different levels of member accessibility that all member variables and functions of a class have: public, protected, and private.
[17:24:04] <CodePoint> [itchyjunk]: protected means it can not be accessed except by inheriting objects.
[17:24:11] <pulse> merijn, it's an arena shooter, like serious sam
[17:24:17] <pulse> it's not even a proper cinematic FPS
[17:24:21] <CodePoint> [itchyjunk]: private means it can only be accessed within the class that it is both defined and declared in.
[17:24:23] <pulse> it's simply a bunch of corridors connected by arenas
[17:24:52] <mrig> DnzAtWrk: I've still not seen any evidence that you can do it is my point :)
[17:24:53] <pulse> it's beautiful yes, the combat isn't that bad, ok, but the map design sucks, the mechanics mostly suck, the "upgrades" are meaningless, etc.
[17:24:55] <merijn> pulse: Which is exactly what 90s shooters were?
[17:24:56] <DnzAtWrk> protected is useful when using inheritance. Consider for example you may a Vehicle class with a position field
[17:25:00] <pulse> merijn, nope
[17:25:05] <DnzAtWrk> and you subclass a Helicopter class
[17:25:14] <merijn> Unreal Tournament, Quake, and literally all their clones...
[17:25:18] <pulse> apart from Serious Sam, 90s FPS had very complex and interesting map design
[17:25:18] <DnzAtWrk> and you want to move the helicopter in a special way inside the class

[17:27:25] <DnzAtWrk> you use a very narrow light angle, casting very sharp shadows
[17:27:25] <pulse> even its secrets are no secrets
[17:27:32] <pulse> just slight deviations from the linear path you take anyway
[17:27:34] <DnzAtWrk> use cycles, greatly increase the sun angle
[17:27:42] <DnzAtWrk> to make the shadows really soft
[17:27:48] <pulse> look at Quake 1 for inspired map design, or Duke3D, or Blood
[17:27:53] <pulse> DOOM aint' it i'm sorry :p
[17:27:56] <DnzAtWrk> then AS YOU ARE PREVIEWING RENDER INSIDE THE EDITOR VIEWPORT

[17:28:05] <DnzAtWrk> until they match the existing shadows
[17:28:06] <pulse> and i played through it so i should know, lol

[19:02:12] <pyzozord> hmm I don't have image magic, but I do have ffmpeg, hmmm
[19:03:26] <deniska> pyzozord: ffmpeg is for moving images, not for static ones
[19:03:42] <deniska> although I'm almost sure there's a right incantation to use it to convert .bmp to .png
[19:03:45] <pyzozord> what is a moving image if not a series of static images :P
[19:03:49] <mrig> seems that there is rather an inordinate amount of work to test for every distro.
[19:04:25] <mrig> Don't the new packaging tools with static linking fix all of that?
[19:04:27] <deniska> mrig: as I said, there's maybe 2-3 you really care about, and the users of other two can take care of themselves :P
[19:04:42] <mrig> ah right yes.
[19:04:59] <mrig> like making things on windows work on xp still.
[19:05:01] <pyzozord> I hope to make a LFS at some point
[19:05:17] <noircode> it's like arch or gentoo, but you compile everything
[19:05:25] <noircode> I might do that tonight actually
[19:05:35] <mrig> you have 3 or 4 version to assure for, and then 2 or 3 linux.
[19:05:36] <pyzozord> probably the apt and dpkg packaging system so that I have acess to the vast debian and ubuntu repos
[19:05:36] <noircode> you fetch all the sources too etc
[19:06:13] <pyzozord> although not sure how much effort it would be to make a LFS that can install ubuntu packages
[19:06:16] <pyzozord> maybe a lot
[19:06:27] <noircode> mrig: it's not bad if you don't have many dependencies and understand how something got packaged
[19:06:44] <noircode> otherwise, if you have a bunch of deps better to flatpak or snap

[19:07:30] <mrig> seems to me that once you get an OS layer abstraction build and understood, you could pretty much just use the same over and over.

[19:07:58] <pyzozord> untill they ask you to call them on zoom
[19:08:11] <noircode> pyzozord: not a lot tbh
[19:08:34] <noircode> just building apt and setting sources
[19:09:00] <deniska> mrig: there're plenty of programs I download as .tar.gz with executables which I unpack and just run from wherever they're extracted to
[19:09:11] <noircode> but you may as well just use ubuntu at that point, you can install ubuntu just like arch etc
[19:09:16] <deniska> mrig: there's also .appimage and newer stuff like flatpak
[19:10:05] <mrig> deniska: I've been discovering of late how simple this can be, was surprised to find that I could do this with ctags on windows to have it available there.
[19:10:05] <deniska> mrig: and if you just make a static executable, or glibc executable with the right linker flags (or just compile on a sufficiently old distro version if you are lazy), it will just work on 90% of distros
[19:10:15] <deniska> mrig: 10% being weird, ancient, or non-glibc stuff
[19:10:50] <deniska> mrig: if you want to make a proper .deb or .rpm, that's a harder deal, sure
[19:11:32] <deniska> but even then I recently installed an x86_32 .rpm from 2003 on ubuntu 20.04 x86_64 and it just… worked
[19:11:35] <mrig> learning lots of things at the moment, such as optimisations of c++ compilers can break booleans when writing c, things like that. Man it is a dense forest! 
[19:11:47] <deniska> (well, I had to lie to apt that it's a 64 bit package, but still)

[22:28:56] <Twix> I'm not into rust, yet. Still sticking to C here :D
[22:29:48] <Twix> i didn't understand the exact advantages of rust, either. I should start learning it ...
[22:29:49] <MrMobius> isnt it still generally slower than C++ not to mention C? i remember hearing about that
[22:30:26] <goldmund> A cursory search shows what I'm probably looking for is borrowing (essentially RW-Locking from what I gather)
[22:30:41] <mrig> I would imagine that it is slower to compile
[22:30:42] <goldmund> MrMobius, compilation, yes. Not sure about the actual runtime
[22:30:45] <InPhase> Twix: Rust has smart pointers and other smart types.  It's not about completely avoiding memory management, but about being able to safely abstract it so that low level problems can be confined to components, and don't leak throughout complex high level logic.
[22:30:53] <micrex22> goldmund: this is why rust is so hyped https://i.imgur.com/WBcpzdR.png

[22:31:25] <Twix> it is encredible slow compiling. Even slower than C++
[22:31:38] <MrMobius> goldmund, oh hmm. runtime is what i had heard about

[22:32:54] <user51> wait, don't i get close to metal if i write my own language in c?
[22:33:07] <InPhase> Proper C++ is quite robust.  It doesn't offer the same scale of modernized features that Rust does though.
