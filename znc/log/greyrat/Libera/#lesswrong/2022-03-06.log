[01:14:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now that he's a candidate for U.S. Senate, the story is coming back to bite him." ... at least it's just the story and not, say, the goat

[08:00:00] <PapuaHardyNet> all right I'm done, I've installed and configured org-fc, and modified the SRS algorithm to be exactly the one I use in my CLI/TUI app

[11:52:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes...
[11:52:54] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[11:53:04] <enterprisey> what's the # loc in JS
[11:53:11] <enterprisey> order of magnitude
[11:53:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno
[11:53:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's less than it would be if we used a framework, though
[11:53:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Obviously)
[11:53:32] <enterprisey> sure
[11:53:42] <enterprisey> there's a breakeven point where you'd rather die than not use a framework, though
[11:53:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> When? Why??
[11:54:05] <enterprisey> I haven't hit it, so I couldn't tell you
[11:54:22] <PapuaHardyNet> hold on, you don't use svelte but you "ride or die" svelte?
[11:54:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would you think that such a point exists
[11:54:41] <enterprisey> why would you think one doesn't?
[11:54:50] <enterprisey> hold on, let me peruse the gwern code for a bit
[11:54:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... because most things don't exist?
[11:55:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not existing is the default
[11:55:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you wanna claim that there's some sort of "breakeven point where you'd rather die than not use a framework", that's something you have to, like... provide *some* justification for
[11:55:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, any justification. At all.
[11:55:47] <enterprisey> because it's a massive pain in the ass to wire up all the state and widgets
[11:56:10] <enterprisey> it's easier to say this widget is connected to this part of the state, and when one changes the other changes
[11:56:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have no idea what you're talking about, honestly
[11:56:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think people who say such things might be doing it wrong
[11:56:54] <enterprisey> instead of "we have some state. we have a widget. this function turns state into widget display. now we call it for the first time on loading the page. now we make sure that exiting the page doesn't blow away in-progress work. now we make sure that changing the widget changes the state"

[11:58:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: Let me suggest to you that if you have such problems on a regular basis, or, like, pervasively, then maybe your whole approach to your whole, like... website, or whatever... might be fundamentally the wrong approach
[11:58:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that maybe the solution is not "frameworks will automate this for me"
[11:58:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe the solution is "perhaps I am building a wrong thing, a thing that should not exist, or should at least be a very different thing"
[11:59:01] <enterprisey> your position is basically "there are no use-cases for single-page applications"
[11:59:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically! Yes!

[12:00:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, I see it
[12:00:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it is totally possible to just
[12:00:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not build SPAs
[12:00:32] <enterprisey> you think google maps should be a desktop application I guess
[12:00:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> That would be good yeah
[12:00:57] <quanticle> I think there's a case to be made that browser APIs have gotten better, and so you don't need a "framework" to deal with the browser. Your "framework" is the DOM. 
[12:01:03] <enterprisey> yeah no
[12:01:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's true
[12:01:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if you need to automate something
[12:01:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Write your own thing
[12:01:31] <enterprisey> I used to be a big SPA hater, but web apps are nice
[12:01:37] <enterprisey> have you written a big desktop application
[12:01:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if you find yourself doing it so much that you feel you need a pre-done thing
[12:01:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then re-examine your project
[12:01:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, like, your life
[12:01:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes I have written a big desktop application
[12:01:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why
[12:02:00] <enterprisey> because they suck
[12:02:05] <enterprisey> *they suck to write
[12:02:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> No they're great
[12:02:10] <enterprisey> yeah, they're great to use
[12:02:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> To write also
[12:02:20] <quanticle> No, they're awful to use. They're great to write
[12:02:26] <enterprisey> what in sam hill
[12:02:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Have you ever used AppKit
[12:02:37] <enterprisey> I mean cross-platform ones
[12:02:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[12:02:45] <quanticle> The reason we have so many webapps is because, to the user, a webapp is often easier to use than a desktop application.
[12:02:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct way to write cross-platform applications
[12:02:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is
[12:02:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> To not do that
[12:03:03] <enterprisey> r/confidentlywrong
[12:03:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> This has been known for literal decades
[12:03:18] <enterprisey> lol, I got the sub name wrong, but that's not important
[12:03:36] <enterprisey> writing an application per platform is hideously inefficient
[12:03:46] <enterprisey> if you want to ritually flagellate yourself, feel free
[12:03:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yet it's the only way to write an application that is actually good.
[12:04:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course you can write bad applications instead! You can do that.
[12:04:01] <quanticle> I would much rather write a desktop application than a webapp. Like, look at React for example. The kind of one-way reactive dataflow was a thing in desktop applications in *Windows 95*
[12:04:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then your apps will be bad.
[12:04:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> So there's that.
[12:04:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, this is not some shocking new take
[12:05:04] <enterprisey> the web platform has improved to the point that it's not too much worse
[12:05:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It hasn't!
[12:05:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is in fact *much worse*
[12:05:20] <enterprisey> for example, google maps isn't too much worse than hypothetical native google maps

[12:08:28] <quanticle> Yeah, it's like what Nietzsche said: "There are horrible people who, instead of solving a problem, tangle it up and make it harder to solve for anyone who wants to deal with it. Whoever does not know how to hit the nail on the head should be asked not to hit it at all."

[12:13:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: Hah, ironically that essay is one of the relatively rare things that I strongly disagree with gwern about
[12:13:46] <enterprisey> interesting, tell me more
[12:15:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> We got into an argument about it a while back... perhaps you can grep your logs, or I will when I have some time
[12:18:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> But essentially my view is that adopters of a new thing deserve every problem that they have as a result of their new thing not being universally adopted, that "holdouts" owe them nothing, and that it's the early adopters who are at fault for everything and "holdouts" are the ones who are transgressed against by new-thing-adopters' efforts
[12:20:20] <galambo> does anybody here use contact lenses?
[12:21:23] <galambo> (I do)
[12:22:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: So e.g. gwern says: "If I use Python 3 and can convince everyone else to use Python 3 rather than 2, regardless of how much the Python 3 improvements themselves actually matter to them or how dishonest my arguments are, I am much better off." - but that's wrong; it's entirely possible that because Python 3 is inferior to 2, you are personally worse off by using 3 (despite your preference), *and* you are worse off
[12:22:34] <Obormot\Arcturus>  if everyone switches to 3 (because it's worse), *and* of course you make everyone else worse off (because 3 is worse)
[12:22:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note that I do not actually use Python and thus have no opinion; this is just an example)
[12:23:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the next sentence:
[12:23:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The path of a programmer who uses the most common language is a blessed path: libraries abound, bugs programmers of lesser languages routinely encounter daily will mysteriously fail to occur in relatively bulletproof codebases, documentation always addresses his use-case with helpful snippets to copy-paste, APIs miraculously return data formatted in a way convenient for his default data structures, which their rich featureful
[12:23:37] <Obormot\Arcturus>  IDE will tab-complete the code for them, Stack Overflow will overflow with tips & tricks for any glitches (which come almost as fun puzzles, bagatelles between the real work), for all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds…4 "
[12:24:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> But again that's wrong! Empirically! Look how commonly used JavaScript is, or PHP; can we say these things about those languages? Bugs that other language users encounters daily fail to occur? Hah! "relatively bulletproof codebases", double hah! "documentation always addresses" ... thrice hah!
[12:24:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole thing is absurd!

[13:42:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The first time it was like... wow, look at all this decaying architecture, all this detail! look at all these mechanisms that I am figuring out how to do clever things with by realizing that they are physical things that behave like physical things, because that's what they are!

[13:47:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then of course the Alexandra commentary, like the one where she goes "and so I read about the Talos Principle and it weirded me out because it made me aware of my body as a physical object" and you're like "yes totally, I sympathize, what with having this robot body that... waaaait a minute."
[13:49:32] <kuudes> I remember with older cars (and I guess maybe also newer cars) one put a cardboard to block cooling air intake if weather was really cold, like -30 C
[13:50:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And the amazing thing is that the game continually induces this illusion *despite* the occasional absolutely blatant, like, stylized game object, like the *keys*, which you just sort of accept even though they are *giant glowing floating keys* that theatrically disappear into your inventory when you walk over them, and then you turn around and look at one of the hexahedra and think "mmm yes this is definitely a physical
[13:50:07] <Obormot\Arcturus>  object that I am physically interacting with, there is nothing suspicious about this at all")
[13:50:25] <quanticle> Haha
[13:51:01] <quanticle> You know, I didn't think about that when I was playing the game, but now that you mention it...
[13:56:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Or like when you go up the tower and ELOHIM is all like "TRACKING OF PRIMARY SUBJECT LOST" and on the first playthrough this seems totally normal, yeah, he can't track you if you go up the tower, sure, this seems entirely reasonable because <probably plausible handwaving>, but on the second playthrough it's ???
[14:01:45] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: YEAH RIGHT??!
[14:02:04] <feep> and of course it all actually makes sense underneath that level
[14:02:42] <feep> and the game just gradually reveals to you that all this physicality is deliberately built for a purpose
[14:04:33] <feep> it's a completely intentional space
[14:08:10] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I can also confirm that playing it together with someone who doesn't know the story is fucking great (if you can keep yourself from spoiling)
[14:14:59] <cpopell> The hand of Seth Dickinson on the Witch Queen lore is fantastic
[14:15:19] <cpopell> Destiny is the most rationalist compatible game setting I know of and it's not even close, lmao
[14:16:27] <quanticle> Yeah, too bad the game itself is kind of grindy
[14:16:48] <cpopell> Hmmm
[14:16:55] <cpopell> much less so than it used to be
[14:17:13] <cpopell> but yes, absolutely more than minimum grind
[14:17:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Yeah, it absolutely makes sense underneath that level, and the thing that makes it surreal is precisely that if you let your guard down for a moment the physicality is instantly and intuitively convincing despite knowing what's going on, but when you do in fact know what's going on, there are these constant moments of realization
[14:17:31] <feep> yeah ~
[14:17:51] <cpopell> @quanticle the witch queen CE lore includes discussion about Savathun and Ahamkara basically trying to privilege escalate their way out of their simulation into our world by modeling their personalities in our world well enough
[14:18:23] <quanticle> Yeah, I think I made it to the endgame of Destiny 2 and I didn't do any of the expansion packs.
[14:18:34] <cpopell> writing has improved quite a bit since vanilla
[14:18:39] <cpopell> I only started in October after reading just lore for years
[14:18:50] <quanticle> Interesting
[14:18:57] <quanticle> Maybe I'll try getting back into it
[14:19:14] <cpopell> and Witch Queen is legitimately a fantastic expansion on its own, with a campaign on par in quality with, idk, some of the Halos

Being vegan proves dedication to a cause like animal rights or environmentalism proportional to the level of sacrifice required.

[14:22:49] <quanticle> associated with the ability to make such a sacrifice, which may include commitment, being deeply bought into the cause such that the sacrifice becomes easier than it would be for other people, conscientiousness, gentleness, etc."

[15:04:05] <kuudes> wasn't there some movie where us kids started to sell ussr spies toy plane guides as blueprints of real planes?
[15:25:38] <kuudes> rather odd. apparently iphones don't come with chargers anymore on purchase? O_o
[15:25:59] <kuudes> glad that I bought also the usb-a cable, otherwise I would have been unable to charge the phone
[15:34:40] <mjr> Yeah. Of course there's a profit motive but it also makes sense from a waste and environmental standpoint. People already tend to have USB chargers around. You don't need to make a new one per every new mobile device. You win in having less electronics built and in smaller packaging and less stuff to ship around.
[15:44:27] <kuudes> I guess. but if I hadn't bought the standard usb a wire, because the system only comes with apple wire, I would have had no way to charge the device
[15:44:40] <kuudes> it would make more sense if it was shipped also with the standard wire
[15:44:57] <kuudes> but iirc this is a thing apple is fighting eu over
[15:45:33] <kuudes> I mean, out of the box you can't use but previous apple chargers. if you have none, you can't charge it out of the box

[16:42:24] <PapuaHardyNet> okay I just want to say I love how serious Bostrom is when he says this: "While the term “utility monster” has academic history, it is a pejorative and potentially
[16:42:24] <PapuaHardyNet> offensive way of referring to beings that have unusually great needs or are able to
[16:42:24] <PapuaHardyNet> realize extraordinarily good lives"
[16:42:54] <feep> I kinda disagree with him
[16:43:26] <feep> I mean, sorta agree sorta disagree? the point of the idea is that simple utilitarian metrics become monstrous at scale
[16:46:33] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, I agree, straight utility theory will always produce horrific outcomes given a "being that has an unusually great need", and calling the "utility monster" a pejorative seems like you are sidestepping the actual problem
