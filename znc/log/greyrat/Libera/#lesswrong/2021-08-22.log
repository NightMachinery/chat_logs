[00:24:00] <dbohdan> A related thing that sucked for Ukrainian more than Russian in the olden days was the keyboard layout.  In several versions of Windows (95-98?) it didn't have the apostrophe, essential to writing Ukrainian.  Amazingly, Microsoft's developers copied the Russian layout to make the Ukrainian one and forgot to remove the letter "Ё", which isn't used in Ukrainian, or put the apostrophe in.  It took several versions for them to fix it.

[00:27:14] <rmmh> clearly a conspiracy by Sinofsky
[00:29:07] <dbohdan> Since the new layout still lacked the optional-but-recommended letter "Ґ", and the situation was visibly better on Linux, making new Ukrainian keyboard layouts for Windows become A Thing.  I even made one with what I thought were the best-of features plus some random stuff: https://diffukr.sourceforge.io/

[00:44:33] <shawwwn> I agree, but, undertale did it right
[00:44:53] <shawwwn> the difference between ff7 and undertale is that ff7 and ff8 were trying as hard as they could

[00:56:39] <ggreer> your imagination fills in some details. also CRTs had better peak brightness and other effects. showing old games on a crisp LCD or OLED kinda misses some aspects of them
[00:57:07] <ggreer> you can emulate the brightness blooms of CRTs, but the brightness in the middle won't be quite as high
[00:58:32] <ggreer> it's kinda like emulating HDR versus actually going outside and experiencing shitloads of lumens

[01:01:59] <gwern> ggreer: incredible. they literally trucked it across the continent step by step. it got the grand tour of the north USA - the NH blueberries, the chicago deep dish pizzas, the national monuments, the space needle at seattle, the scenic vistas of wyoming... that package... truly... *lived*...
[01:02:02] <shawwwn> every time I made rocko references, they fell flatter than the cat I found on the street that had been squished by a car that I took to a vet to find out whether they were microchipped to inform their owner but they weren't
[01:02:14] <shawwwn> (threw it in a dumpster and my friend kept calling it pancake cat)
[01:02:28] <shawwwn> so I stopped making rocko references
[01:02:51] <saturn2> the only thing i remember about that show was that i didn't like it
[01:03:00] <ggreer> It’s basically Americana at this point
[01:03:27] <gwern> I remember rocko as basically being a little weird but very boring. like _Doug_
[01:03:49] <saturn2> i think doug was even more boring
[01:03:51] <gwern> Doug, I'm pretty sure, was in fact shit, but maybe Rocko was just going over my head

[01:43:50] <galambo> is this the rationale behind people supporting inflation? https://nitter.42l.fr/chamath/status/1375244032230625281
[01:43:52] <Robomot> Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath): "Here is something I learned today:    1. 1979 was peak inflation. It was also when the gap between rich and poor was the smallest.     2. It was preceded by a big wealth inequality b/w rich and poor like today.     3. Solution started in late 1960s with LBJs war on poverty." | 42l - nitter (Here is something I learned today:)
[01:45:41] <galambo> (I disagree with the author because I witnessed inflation or maybe stagflation and it was definitely bad for poor people)
[01:46:01] <gwern> I think inflation is way more complicated that this chamath dude seems to think... inflation doesn't just 'make the wealthy poorer'
[01:47:34] <gwern> the redistributional effects will be weird. the rich own most equity, that's not affected; bonds are no longer all that popular; it'll reduce home mortgages a ton which will benefit primarily middle & upper class (the poor don't *have* mortgages)
[01:48:05] <gwern> a lot of that would be redistribution from the old to the young, which I'm not sure chamath would be thrilled by
[01:48:15] <ivan> inflation also makes people waste time trying to keep their money through stonks

[01:53:02] <kuudes> which is some sort of organization outside nato but perhaps relying on nato
[01:53:21] <gwern> 'Hungary plays a special role in the SAC as the host nation. The SAC C-17's are registered and flagged in Hungary bearing the national military aircraft insignia of the nation.' why hungary
[01:53:22] <kuudes> and finland and sweden are full members of that organization among many nato countries (finland and sweden are not in nato)
[01:54:02] <kuudes> I wonder what other similar sort of programs exist
[01:54:53] <kuudes> this is in news now here, as it appears those planes are operating a georgia-kabul airlift, and finnish military contingent appears to be lifted with them from tblisi to kabul

[01:55:54] <Robomot> Heavy Airlift Wing - Wikipedia (The Heavy Airlift Wing (HAW) is an international military airlift organization based at Pápa Air Base, Hungary. The organization consists of certain European nations and the United States. …)
[01:56:09] <kuudes> "The HAW is independent of any command by NATO, European Union, Partnership for Peace, United Nations, or any other organization that HAW member nations belong to or support in the various missions. It is overseen by the SAC Steering Board, which manages its activities with support of NATO Airlift Management Programme Office (NAM PO)."
[01:56:53] <kuudes> ie something like "nato but not nato and organization unallied sweden and finland are members to without being members to nato" O_o
[01:57:24] <kuudes> I guess it would be nice if nato could work out some sort of similar arrangement with sweden and finland as eu has with norway?

[02:13:14] <foamy> does anybody have any good website for weather / storm data that is more data driven 
[02:18:16] <gwern> come to think of it, video/computer games are a bit of a dog-that-didn't-bark when it comes to the big picture stuff. I mean, if all my knowledge of the last 20 years of gaming was erased, what would I really feel upset to now be ignorant of in terms of the great human story, the great tides of history, new ways of thinking and being? mobile games? "We have Gameboys now with Wifi" "Cool, got...
[02:18:22] <gwern> ...it". Minecraft or Roblox? "It's like SimLegos" "Makes sense, the kids probably go nuts in it" "they do, they do". Streaming? "It's like radio or sports commentators on ESPN, but more so; sportsball but the ball is digital" "Makes sense, Justintv showed that'd work for any damn thing"
[02:18:39] <gwern> (gamergate? don't make me laugh)
[02:19:02] <gwern> this is pretty amazing when you consider the absolute sheer vast amount of money, time, and effort that goes into them
[02:19:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that true for, like, TV shows also...?
[02:19:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> But no, you're wrong about one thing
[02:19:30] <gwern> I feel like if you were writing about american culture, you'd have to mention the golden age of TV and other things like that
[02:19:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> MMOs are a big deal
[02:19:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> They had a lot of influence on things
[02:20:03] <gwern> MMOs were a pretty big deal before 2001! and MUDs/MOOs before that
[02:20:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> No they weren't
[02:20:16] <gwern> everquest was '99
[02:20:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> EverQuest wasn't a big deal
[02:20:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The first MMO that was a big deal was WoW
[02:21:03] <gwern> I remember it being a pretty frigging big deal, but alright, what did MMOs like WoW do post-2001 that genuinely changed the culture and humanity?
[02:21:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Had like 25x more subscribers, that's what
[02:22:08] <gwern> like, look at how little video games come up in culture wars right now. heck, ghetto genres like 'young adult novels' singlehandedly stir way more drama than [checks note] possibly the single largest entertainment sector and consumer of young waking hours in the world?
[02:23:02] <gwern> what new ideology has ever sprung from gaming? what new esthetic movement?
[02:23:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> What new ideology has ever sprung from TV shows...?
[02:23:17] <gwern> it all feels weirdly sterile and completely walled off
[02:23:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course it does, because you're not part of it
[02:24:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you're not a gamer *at all*, then you won't feel the influence
[02:24:24] <ivan> Minecraft was a pretty big deal
[02:24:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> See? This is a perfect example
[02:24:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't feel any influence of Minecraft, because I've never played it, I am not into streaming, etc.
[02:25:19] <gwern> minecraft is a pretty big deal, but also seems to slot in perfectly well into existing childhood patterns. you used to build elaborate lego sets, well, now you build SimLego, sorry, I mean, Minecraft worlds
[02:25:41] <gwern> less for your parents to step on, at least
[02:26:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess I just don't see what you're comparing it to
[02:27:06] <kuudes> oh, btw, what is afganistan covid situation and pronosis?
[02:27:09] <kuudes> *prognosis
[02:27:37] <gwern> perhaps I'm just thinking too much about early promises from the likes of papert or wright or video game critics about how gaming would be a transformative medium of thought and expression, meta-art, etc
[02:28:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Transformative of what? And in what way?
[02:30:19] <gwern> (and instead we have, like, yahtzee boredly reviewing yet another 'roguelite' or by the numbers fps, and it seems like the regular churn of a medium no more revolutionary, dangerous, powerful, or in need of censoring than, say, daytime soap operas, and that's why he needs to drop f-bombs and make offensive analogies to 'sex dolls made out of toast' in order to disguise the utter tedium and...
[02:30:25] <gwern> ...stasis of his subject matter)
[02:31:08] <gwern> 'news is what someone somewhere wants to suppress; all else is advertising', as lord northcliffe put it. after the '90s moral panics subsided, few feel much need to do much suppressing of video games
[02:31:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes most of the shit he reviews is bad
[02:31:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's definitely not concealed in any way
[02:31:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's been exactly one game, *ever*, that he's had literally nothing bad to say about
[02:32:29] <gwern> maybe another way of putting it: ellison named his anthology '*Dangerous* Visions' and new wave SF/F was indeed often quite exciting and provoking. what was the last video game you could seriously say was *dangerous*?
[02:33:00] <gwern> these days it's like, 'oh no edgelord neonazis are making oven jokes in private Roblox games'
[02:33:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That said, some of the games he reviews are, on balance, good, and many have innovative things; e.g. his review of STALKER: Clear Sky wasn't unequivocally positive, but he did endorse it on the whole, largely because it wasn't the same shit again, despite being an FPS)
[02:33:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Ironic, of course, since Clear Sky was the worst of the three STALKER games; if only he'd chosen to review one of the other two...)
[02:34:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: _Dangerous Visions_ wasn't dangerous either
[02:34:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was just Ellison posturing
[02:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g. this story was in there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_All_Men_Were_Brothers,_Would_You_Let_One_Marry_Your_Sister%3F ... which boiled down to Sturgeon going "But what if ... INCEST??? Huh? Shocking, isn't it???" and expecting readers to go "GASP!!! Fetch the smelling salts, for heaven's sake...!"
[02:35:53] <Robomot> If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Let One Marry Your Sister? - Wikipedia ("If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Let One Marry Your Sister?" is a science fiction short story by American writer Theodore Sturgeon. It first appeared in Harlan Ellison's anthology Dangerous Visions in 1967. …)
[02:36:02] <SDr> gwern, your evaluation criteria smells to me as "what role in politics did gaming played", and I kinda sorta super appreciate that it did not, and does not, because I game to vibe, and code to do reality optimization.
[02:36:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> When in fact the more typical reaction is something like "Ok, that's weird and kind of icky, but go on?" and then there's no actual story
[02:36:35] <SDr> gwern, if/when a game gets political, I want to be _not there_.
[02:36:50] <gwern> SDr: my point here is more that gaming hasn't played any role in politics, religion, or sociology because it's *too weak*, not because of any laudable stand on principle or being so powerful it can remain aloof
[02:37:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutopia_(short_story) where it's like "Ancient Greeks but in the future or something!" "Oh cool" "But then... PEDERASTY! Aha gotcha!" "Oh no :O "
[02:37:38] <Robomot> Eutopia (short story) - Wikipedia ("Eutopia" is a short story by American writer Poul Anderson, originally appeared in Harlan Ellison's 1967 science fiction anthology Dangerous Visions.

[02:38:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they're all like that, *at worst*
[02:38:03] <gwern> I think you could probably make a case that gaming has had important effects on STEM, possibly: I wonder if AI or all the simulation-based approaches would do so well if all researchers now hadn't grown up with games
[02:38:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> The better ones are just, good stories, sure, but dangerous? Get outta here
[02:39:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: If anything, _Dangerous Visions_ was perfect proof of how right Lem was about Western sf
[02:39:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> If that's "dangerous", if that can "single-handedly change how readers thought about sf" or w/e, then... lol.

Some HABs are associated with algae-produced toxins.[1] Blooms can last from a few days to many months. …)
[03:17:33] <two2thehead> I always assumed that algal blooms to be a saltwater/ocean thing. TIL that it occurs in fresh water as well
[03:23:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh so how did that work?
[03:23:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did they drink tainted water? Or what
[03:28:22] <kuudes> ""We don't know the cause… we won't rest until we figure it out," Mariposa County Sheriff Jeremy Briese told the Fresno Bee newspaper."
[03:29:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why do they think it's algae then?? THis is very odd
[03:30:19] <kuudes> all this complaining I hear on media about the restrictions... if we got bird flu, thing that kills 1/2 of people who get it, and we would fail to find any treatment or vaccine for it, would people still be for stopping restrictions after a year?
[03:30:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I've been wondering the same thing for a while now
[03:31:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's one of the most bizarre things about all the discourse
[03:31:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like that bit in Zvi's recent COVID post about how supposedly babies are affected by their caregivers wearing masks, and THEREFORE, policies that say caregivers should wear masks are inherently immoral and should be opposed!
[03:32:08] <kuudes> yes
[03:32:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it's like ... ok, but you wouldn't say this if a caregiver not wearing a mask definitely led to the baby immediately dying, right??
[03:32:29] <kuudes> indeed
[03:32:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> So all you're really saying is "COVID isn't really dangerous" and/or "masks don't really work", which... may or may not be true, but then just make *those* arguments
[03:33:03] <kuudes> I agree
[03:33:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's very weird to see this total failure to even give a nod to cost-benefit analyses, *from the very fucking people* who constantly harp on how the media and the experts ignore cost-benefit analyses!
[03:33:51] <kuudes> I mean, it makes sense to be on prior that vaccines make covid not-dangerous. but then one should be prepared to alter that prior if people start to die again in lots
[03:34:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, yes, but again, *make those arguments then*
[03:34:13] <kuudes> indeed
[03:34:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> If COVID isn't dnagerous or masks don't work or both, then... yeah, duh, obviously caregivers shouldn't wear masks
[03:34:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no additional discussion to be had in that case
[03:35:08] <kuudes> I guess this is just the same as in 2020? ie "you go first, please"
[03:35:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> You don't need to pound the table and insist that something is very immoral, damnit, can't you people see that!! ... if that thing is totally unnecessary/ineffective in the first place
[03:35:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if you *do* pound the table, it makes one suspect that maybe you don't have any good arguments for the latter, factual, point
[03:35:58] <kuudes> yes

[04:22:29] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: I see, but what about just directly connecting it to an x86 box running Linux? I mean, it's just SCSI, right? surely I should be able to buy some cable that just hooks that SCSI up to USB/makes it visible to Linux?

[04:45:09] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: which is slightly odd because the diffusion ones don't really have noticeably higher FID/IS, do they? perhaps the diffusion objective makes them fundamentally more suited to repeated pixel-wise editing? after all, CLIP ascending its gradient is a lot like the denoising process itself

[04:45:39] <gwern> feep: feepbot ded, again
[04:46:04] <RiversHaveWings> The diffusion models are chonk enough (and have enough self-attention blocks at the low resolution stages of their u-net arch) to model global coherence

[04:48:52] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: idk. one clue perhaps is that i'm trying to drag the generative models off-distribution with CLIP, and diffusion is far more amenable to that
[04:49:02] <RiversHaveWings> The dimensionality of the 'latent' is higher
[04:49:09] <RiversHaveWings> It's the same dimensionality as the output image.
[04:49:36] <gwern> why would that help? I'd expect higher 'latents' to have much weirder and worse dynamics because of overfitting
[04:50:00] <gwern> I think the clip iterative optimization resembling noise training is probably a better reason
[04:50:02] <RiversHaveWings> You'd think so, but the CLIP-conditioned sampling method I use makes it work.
[04:50:37] <RiversHaveWings> It's not gradient descent, it doesn't fully optimize for the CLIP loss
[04:50:39] <gwern> when you optimize pixel-wise with something to ascend to the most likely image, you are in a very real way doing exactly what you trained it to do: to improve pixel by pixel, from noisy to decent
[04:51:13] <RiversHaveWings> It interprets the CLIP gradients as the gradient of a log probability
[04:51:19] <gwern> biggan has nothing similar, and its latent space is not designed nor trained for that. it has nothing at all in the way of consistency or path regularization losses to make the latent smooth
[04:51:59] <gwern> and we do see some pretty weird and odd looking latent interpolations, so it's not too surprising necessarily if optimizing over latents doesn't work super well

[12:16:24] <PapuaHardyNet> "Symbolic story generation systems were capable of generating reasonably long and coherent stories. These systems derived much of their power from well-formed knowledge bases. But these knowledge bases had to be structured by hand, which limited what the systems could generate. When we shifted to neural networks, we gained the power of neural networks to acquire and make use of knowledge from corpora.
[12:16:33] <PapuaHardyNet> Suddenly, we could build story generation systems that could generate a larger space of stories about a greater range of topics. But we also set aside a lot of what was known about the psychology of readers and the ability to reason over rich knowledge structures to achieve story coherence. Even increasing the size of neural language models has only delayed the inevitability of coherence collapse in stories generated by neural networks."

[13:35:29] <feep> yorick: then feepbot emits the gwernpaste when it notices a few minutes of silence.
[13:35:38] <feep> thus avoiding interrupting running conversations.

[13:35:58] <feep> it's not gwern emulation, it's just gwern timeshift

[13:36:14] <quanticle> I say this unironically

[13:36:45] <quanticle> Okay, I guess

[13:53:30] <feep> okay
[13:53:39] <feep> I have listened to fucking tes lore for approximately 24 hours now
[13:53:54] <feep> and I am going to tentatively stake a claim that holy shit, this is wilder and more detailed than *lord of the fucking rings' cosmology*
[13:54:09] <feep> like, not as a matter of exaggeration, but there's just genuinely more depth to it.
[13:54:11] <cpopell> first time?
[13:54:16] <cpopell> there's layers and there's layers
[13:54:22] <cpopell> I suggest stopping before you get into c0da stuff
[13:54:26] <feep> first time in depth, yeah, and I hadn't realized that eso was adding on to it
[13:54:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Alright, I redid /index, check it out
[13:54:34] <feep> cpopell: it's too late
[13:54:36] <cpopell> oof
[13:54:37] <feep> I've already read kirkbride
[13:54:52] <cpopell> so the problem is that Kirkbride has a pretty strong view of the metafictional truth of TES
[13:54:57] <cpopell> which is 'everything is canon'
[13:54:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is TES
[13:55:00] <feep> that's not a problem
[13:55:02] <cpopell> The Elder Scrolls
[13:55:03] <quanticle> The Elder Scrolls
[13:55:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh
[13:55:15] <cpopell> feep: it's a problem if you're trying to discuss anything particularly concrete about the setting
[13:55:17] <feep> due to that specific view, we can ignore kirkbride at leisure~
[13:55:20] <cpopell> hahaha
[13:55:32] <cpopell> the problem is he did a lot of really good stuff and contributed a lot of the main excellent batshittery
[13:55:35] <cpopell> but also some of the bad batshittery
[13:55:43] <feep> cpopell: but the thing is, and I didn't know this, eso is still playing in a kirkbridean sandbox
[13:55:45] <dbohdan> feep: You could replace "sleep 60" with capped exponential backoff starting at much less than 60 seconds
[13:55:45] <cpopell> 36 Sermons of Vivec is core
[13:55:50] <feep> dbohdan: meh tho
[13:56:02] <feep> cpopell: I mean, purely as a matter of density, sure
[13:56:22] <quanticle> Okay, do you know what *I* don't understand? Why is it so difficult to install apps on Linux, these days? In the old days, you just ran `apt install`, and life was good. Why, exactly, do we need, Snap, Flatpak and AppImage?
[13:56:25] <feep> but like ... again, listening to a current tes podcast, I don't think vivec and his chim thing is still *as* core to the narrative as it used to be
[13:56:33] <feep> quanticle: you still run apt install
[13:56:44] <feep> this is difficult because multiple factions are trying to make it difficult in the name of lock-in
[13:56:57] <feep> but what was easy is still easy
[13:57:02] <cpopell> imo, the most interesting questions about Elder Scrolls touch on, uh...whether or not the Aedra are accessible as actual planets, whether or not people still have spaceships, if the Eye of Magnus is actually a time travelling asteroid mining satellite, etc.
[13:57:05] <quanticle> feep: No I don't. I'm trying to install this podcatcher, and I'm running flatpak install flathub com.github.needleandthread.vocal
[13:57:32] <feep> quanticle: oh, it's a thing that's trying to do flatpak only? welp, idk then
[13:57:47] <feep> cpopell: isn't the whole point of the aedra that they don't contain worlds?
[13:57:50] <cpopell> feep: what 'is' the narrative was, at least as of a few years, a highly political question. there's 'core narrative' stuff, which is everything explicitly surfaced, Text as Written, in recent games
[13:57:54] <quanticle> And you'd think that to run the application, it'd just be `vocal`, right? Nope, it's `flatpak run com.application.needlethread.vocal`.
[13:58:12] <feep> quanticle: welp
[13:58:20] <cpopell> feep: Ehhhhhh the Orrery pretty clearly identifies the planets around Nirn as identifying with the Aedra

[13:58:47] <feep> oh, it's an addon
[13:59:11] <feep> okay but doesn't that contradict like ... convention
[13:59:22] <cpopell> so does the ragada creation myth
[13:59:32] <feep> right, I was about to say, not that that's like the one canon
[13:59:42] <cpopell> also, multiple dragon breaks in between
[13:59:49] <cpopell> also it's not the same between kalpas
[13:59:56] <feep> yeah and also .. is this observed truth, or like, modelled truth
[14:00:11] <cpopell> for example, the reason Dagoth Ur is so pissy is because he's tormented across Kalpas until he destroys all the mass that he had previously hidden between Kalpas as a trickster spirit
[14:00:15] <cpopell> (as I recall, it's been years)

[14:02:14] <cpopell> https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Monomyth you have to read this page to get any kind of start
[14:02:14] <Robomot> Lore:The Monomyth - The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP)
[14:02:20] <feep> I've read it ... a few times...
[14:02:26] <feep> might take a few more...
[14:02:35] <cpopell> also, remember, it's very possible the Eye and I and Tower are actually, uhhhh
[14:02:37] <cpopell> ...just a CD
[14:02:40] <cpopell> as in the CD the game came on
[14:02:46] <cpopell> (this is a pet theory that I subscribe to)
[14:02:48] <feep> okay, I think that's going too kirkbride
[14:03:12] <feep> I remember someone saying that kirkbride explicitly said that he is not the godhead 
[14:03:19] <feep> which makes me sad, cause that's *my* pet theory
[14:03:29] <cpopell> he's not, because he doesn't actually have creative control, for one
[14:03:32] <cpopell> he's just a consultant
[14:03:51] <feep> sure, but that's ... like, a lot of chim makes more sense from a view of patternism, right?
[14:04:04] <feep> vivec is a pattern instantiated, initially, on the devs and writers' brains
[14:04:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a game, right
[14:04:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or... multiple... games?
[14:04:22] <feep> I KNOW, RIGHT
[14:04:27] <cpopell> it is a game with many, many years of fiction build up
[14:04:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I didn't click on any of the links)
[14:04:33] <cpopell> well, more like...7 games or something
[14:04:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I'm just asking)
[14:04:59] <quanticle> Lmao, this software
[14:05:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> (None of this impresses me at all because I play D&D)
[14:05:02] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: to a first approximation, this is all on kirkbride wanting to make the religious history of the setting way, way, wayyyy deeper than it needs to be
[14:05:16] <cpopell> @Obormot\Arcturus  it is a game where the base level of the lore is explicitly metafictional, and the argument about it is mostly at what level the metafiction is
[14:05:28] <quanticle> I try to import podcasts from an OPML file. Something every other podcatcher does fine.
[14:05:32] <quanticle> Immediate crash
[14:05:35] <quanticle> Good job
[14:05:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who is kirkbride
[14:05:42] <cpopell> the way they resolve the fact that different things happen in the course of different people's playthroughs is via something called a Dragonbreak, wherein time itself is broken
[14:05:43] <feep> quanticle: yeah this is why I don't use pak*s
[14:05:54] <cpopell> Michael Kirkbride was one of the main writers for Morrowind
[14:06:00] <cpopell> and is a consultant on the TES series
[14:06:04] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: like, this is my pet theory, depending on interpretatioin. there is a character in the game who has the explicit ability to, when instantiated in the mind of the writer, dissolve his ego into the writer's ego.
[14:06:06] <feep> -i
[14:06:20] <cpopell> yeah you kind of have to specify at what level the debate is happening
[14:06:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh ok
[14:06:26] <kuudes> btw. if one would currently have covid+ salive in the fridge from summer 2020, would it be useful now? ie get pre-alpha covid after 2 dose vaccine?
[14:06:27] <cpopell> I'm pretty sure it explicitly inspired Worth the Candle
[14:06:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sounds weird and lame tbh
[14:06:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh that explains it
[14:06:33] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: to be clear, this is never ever explicitly stated
[14:06:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because Worth the Candle was bad
[14:06:59] <cpopell> Obormot\Arcturus: you can step out of the weird metafiction stuff pretty reasonably, but the base layer then is like
[14:07:01] <cpopell> gnostic buddhism
[14:07:06] <feep> there's just some sort of vague hints that sort of sound less like "a character making decisions in the game world" and more "a dev changing things around in the level editor"
[14:07:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: This sounds kind of like this writer dude engaging in writing-masturbation
[14:07:14] <cpopell> plus time travel and observer dependent physics
[14:07:20] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: oh it is 100% masturbation
[14:07:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool
[14:07:31] <feep> none of this has any relevance to the games.
[14:07:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Great
[14:07:46] <feep> but you know, it's there if you want to dig, and it hangs together~
[14:07:53] <cpopell> (blah blah a famous knight was actually basically a time traveling magical terminator sent to the past to murder the fuck out of elves)
[14:07:56] <PapuaHardyNet> morrowind was an amazing game for its time
[14:08:09] <feep> the lore isn't *made up*; well, the lore *is* made up, but it's made up in a way that completely hangs together with the cosmology.
[14:08:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is not as deep as some D&D settings I've seen
[14:08:29] <cpopell> oh yeah, feep, Pelinal Whitestrake is a time traveling terminator. Probably.
[14:08:34] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: you have seen us talking for like ten minutes.
[14:08:39] <PapuaHardyNet> wait what, who is the terminator here? Dagoth Ur?
[14:08:41] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I have listened to people talk about this for *a day*.
[14:08:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Oh no, a day :p
[14:08:52] <cpopell> I hung out in an irc channel for it for two years
[14:08:53] <cpopell> lmao
[14:08:55] <feep> come on, d&d isn't that deep.
[14:09:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> D&D is like 10x deeper tbh
[14:09:06] <cpopell> https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/
[14:09:08] <Robomot> /r/teslore (r/teslore: /r/teslore is a subreddit dedicated to the discussion and creation of the vast lore of The Elder Scrolls.)
[14:09:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's really no comparison between this and D&D
[14:09:23] <cpopell> there is more lore to TES than any given D&D setting
[14:09:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lies
[14:09:33] <cpopell> but not than all D&D settings together
[14:09:41] <feep> that's true
[14:09:45] <PapuaHardyNet> why do you defend DnD so much
[14:09:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's more Realmslore alone than this stuff
[14:09:51] <feep> but like ... "all d&d settings" aren't *one* setting.
[14:10:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody said anything about "all settings together" except you guys, dunno where you got that
[14:10:23] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: it's not so much a question of volume as like, mythic depth. I mean, there's a difference between lore and narrative.
[14:10:47] <cpopell> There is a shitload of volume.
[14:10:57] <feep> there is also a shitload of volume, yes.
[14:11:07] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: sorry, no clue about the AppImage lore
[14:11:22] <quanticle> It's fine
[14:11:25] <cpopell> https://www.imperial-library.info/books/all/by-category this is just in game books lol
[14:11:33] <Robomot> The books from all Elder Scrolls games | The Imperial Library
[14:11:57] <PapuaHardyNet> love the books.
[14:12:04] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[14:12:22] <feep> honestly, cpopell makes it sound a lot more meta than it is
[14:12:30] <feep> the really meta stuff is mostly just vivec doing vivec things
[14:12:36] <quanticle> I'm inclined to believe Obormot\Arcturus, tbh. D&D is a game where the lore is the product. The Elder Scrolls is a game where the lore is, at best, a supporting feature. It adds depth and flavor to the game world, but the end product is the gameplay.
[14:12:46] <rsaarelm> The TES lore thing is so weird. Like, the games just feel like badly made boring bulk fantasy. And then the lore stuff is some weirdness, but there weirdness isn't reflected at all in the game.
[14:12:58] <feep> the rest of the creation mythology is more like ... different peoples having different biases and different preconceived vantages on what *may* be the same events.
[14:13:02] <rsaarelm> Like, compare Dark Souls, where you're instantly hit in the face that "this is metaphysically weird" from the game.
[14:13:14] <feep> rsaarelm: objection
[14:13:22] <feep> morrowind does not feel like boring bulk fantasy.
[14:13:28] <rsaarelm> Okay, granted.
[14:13:31] <rsaarelm> But it was 20 years ago.
[14:13:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> As far as mythic depth goes, Planescape has this stuff beat hands down, primarily because it's more coherent, philosophically and stylistically
[14:13:36] <feep> and all this weird shit started in morrowind.
[14:13:49] <feep> at this point we can assume that tes has two consumer bases.
[14:13:55] <rsaarelm> TES is Skyrim and whatever the hell goes on in the Online thing now.
[14:13:57] <PapuaHardyNet> the lore feels organic, especially in morrowind
[14:14:22] <cpopell> I agree other pieces are more coherent
[14:14:23] <feep> right? cause morrowind foregrounds it
[14:14:27] <rsaarelm> I guess my failing is that I never managed to get into Morrowind.
[14:14:33] <cpopell> Part of the problem is that the exact stations of canon are uncertain
[14:14:35] <rsaarelm> Even though I played it when it was reasonably new.
[14:14:43] <feep> in skyrim it's like "oh no, a giant evil dragon, is it the instantiation of the consumptive principle trying to end the current kalpa? who cares, kill it"

[14:15:20] <feep> there's like, *one* conversation about what alduin's purpose in the grand scheme of things is.
[14:15:24] <rsaarelm> Also, Thief the Dark Project was mundanely weird, but it had a really great feeling at the start where you went, this is weird and sorta creepy and I don't really understand what's going on.
[14:15:42] *** Joins: Nivim (~Nivim@184.99.17.68)
[14:15:47] <cpopell> the lore explains the Thalmor's motives for being genocidal nutbags, etc.
[14:15:54] <feep> meanwhile in morrowind you literally detune the heart of the god who died to make the world from its divinity.
[14:15:55] <cpopell> but you could just as easily say 'they're elf nazis'
[14:15:57] <rsaarelm> And Beths obviously hasn't had the balls to do anything like that in the last 15 years or so.
[14:16:08] <feep> it's a bit of a different level of mythic quality :p
[14:16:19] <cpopell> (The Thalmor are trying to unmake creation. That's why)
[14:16:25] <feep> cpopell: that's one book, too
[14:16:37] <cpopell> Ehhh, supported across a lot of others
[14:16:40] <quanticle> More Ubuntu hilarity: if you try to unmount a drive that you're cd'd into in a shell, it just fails silently
[14:16:43] <feep> like, I love the line "erase the upstart talos from the mythic" as much as anyone but
[14:16:43] <quanticle> No error message
[14:16:52] <quanticle> No "This drive is busy" like you get on windows
[14:16:57] <quanticle> Just nothing happens
[14:17:00] <feep> quanticle: that *should* error.
[14:17:09] <feep> are you cd'd into the root folder?
[14:17:11] <quanticle> I agree, but it does not
[14:17:12] <feep> or a subfolder
[14:17:14] <Dyo> TES lore went to shit after kirkbride left. no surprise
[14:17:15] <quanticle> Subfolder
[14:17:15] <cpopell> feep: they're not just trying to get rid of Talos, they're trying to unmake creation entirely to set themselves free of mortality
[14:17:19] <feep> idk then
[14:17:24] <cpopell> Dyo: kirkbride is also a problem, kinda
[14:17:25] <feep> cpopell: I mean, ostensibly, yes, and it's great
[14:17:35] <rsaarelm> So the vibe I get from TES is that it's very straitjacketed disneyfied pink slime at the top, and then you let that one employee who has cool ideas and likes to drop acid run around a bit in the margins as an indulgence.
[14:17:42] <feep> cpopell: but it's still kind of like ... one indirect claim, that could easily be faked
[14:17:48] <Dyo> cpopell: how so?
[14:18:12] <cpopell> Dyo: he's like that guy who keeps giving his self insert more superpowers, except for kirkbride it's undermining the narrative with more metafiction
[14:18:14] <cpopell> endlessly :P
[14:18:20] <feep> rsaarelm: yeah but you forget the part where you lose track of him in the margins and then the next morning you wake up with a headache and the game has about 50 more books in it that nobody admits to writing
[14:18:41] <feep> and also instead of a boss it's a huge heart inside a golem
[14:18:48] <feep> and nobody admits to making that change either
[14:19:01] <rsaarelm> Doesn't matter if there's Watsonian exegesis about how it's all this LSDified weirdness in the occult core, since the Doylist mainline is still solidly pink slime and not in an inenvitable subversion way either.
[14:19:11] <feep> no yeah definitely
[14:19:22] <quanticle> Honestly, at this rate
[14:19:23] <feep> but since they seem committed to keeping the lore going, I'm willing to tolerate the slime~

[14:22:41] <feep> so only the strongest bugs materialize, when you then get to fight with like, kernel flags
[14:22:52] <quanticle> Maybe my stand is insufficiently powerful
[14:23:17] <feep> seriously, *how* would networking and usb stop working
[14:23:20] <feep> on 18.04 or something
[14:23:25] <quanticle> Some dbus fuckery
[14:23:30] <feep> that explains nothing!
[14:23:40] <feep> dbus works on kde exactly the same as on gnome
[14:23:57] <quanticle> Well, apparently it didn't lol
[14:24:01] <feep> I guess
[14:24:03] <feep> whatever
[14:24:07] <feep> you'll be back
[14:24:22] <quanticle> Basically, I had to go back into Gnome, launch Network Manager, do some shit
[14:24:26] <quanticle> Then go back into KDE
[14:24:33] <feep> that makes approximately no sense
[14:24:39] <quanticle> You're telling me!
[14:24:49] <feep> were you 
[14:24:51] <feep> like
[14:24:53] <quanticle> I was like, "This is absolutely retarded" from start to finish
[14:24:56] <feep> keeping a gnome session open in the background
[14:25:00] <feep> or something
[14:25:04] <quanticle> No? I rebooted
[14:25:09] <feep> man I don't know then
[14:25:22] <quanticle> Anyway, I think later today, I'll try installing kubuntu-desktop 
[14:25:28] <quanticle> And when that predictably fails
[14:25:32] <quanticle> I'll yell at you
[14:25:37] <quanticle> (Assuming my network works)
[14:25:41] <quanticle> And then I'll install windows
[14:26:13] <cpopell> Man. I know, China and all, but Genshin is a remarkable game (despite its many flaws)
[14:26:24] <RiversHaveWings> dbohdan: ah
[14:26:24] <quanticle> I dunno
[14:26:30] <quanticle> cpopell: It's a mobile game
[14:26:36] <quanticle> So whatever lore or whatever it has
[14:26:43] <quanticle> Is behind like infinite lootboxen
[14:26:49] <cpopell> it's (also) a mobile game, besides PC and PS4
[14:26:56] <cpopell> idk, it's pretty easy to f2p Genshin
[14:27:00] <quanticle> Genshin Impact is on PC?
[14:27:04] <quanticle> Huh
[14:27:05] <cpopell> yes, that's the only place I play it
[14:27:17] <quanticle> I've only heard of it as a mobile game
[14:27:25] <quanticle> And so my usual prejudice around mobile games kicked in
[14:27:28] <cpopell> It's a pretty good game for PC!
[14:28:27] <cpopell> My thoughts on Genshin - It has responsive, fun combat. It's free, so the friends into that sort of game can play it with me. The worldbuilding is fantastic, although dialogue can be cringey from time to time. It has regular, high quality updates. It doesn't require you to spend money unless you particularly ache for 'X'.
[14:28:42] <feep> good memes too
[14:28:45] <quanticle> The other reason I was prejudiced against it is because I've heard it promoted by Influencers™
[14:29:03] <cpopell> It's basically my guilty pleasure game right now
[14:29:30] <cpopell> The setting is interesting and mysterious but the mystery is probably not just a mystery box
[14:29:57] <quanticle> TBF I have heard good things about the art in Genshin
[14:30:07] <quanticle> Like, the studio is staffed by a bunch of straight up weebs
[14:30:13] <cpopell> Downsides: Gacha. Sometimes cringe dialogue. It encourages you to play every day.
[14:30:13] <quanticle> And it shows in the art
[14:30:27] <cpopell> Oh absolutely. And they have used their massive budget to get weeb favorite VAs (which I don't care about)
[14:30:48] <cpopell> my absolute biggest story complaint is that they have your annoying companion do most of the talking for you, and your 'main' character is silent in ways that break immersion
[14:31:15] <feep> ahaha
[14:31:57] <cpopell> I have a number of smaller complaints, like the bias towards additional female characters rather than male ones, but that's mostly irrelevant
[14:31:58] <feep> this podcast <3 "[so we can't really know anything for certain.]" "Anyway! Mundus is Lorkhan's Realm and he's a Daedric prince! :smug:"
[14:32:19] <rsaarelm> Genshin looks like they're just weaponizing people who like lore complexity to make their crummy paypig game get even more traction.
[14:32:33] <feep> cough tes cough
[14:32:38] <cpopell> I would say that they aren't particularly leaning on those people to get their game traction
[14:32:49] <cpopell> their game has traction on its own but if it leans on anything to advertise, it's waifus
[14:33:01] <cpopell> *and some husbandos
[14:33:11] <feep> oh man, now I'm wondering how a gacha tes would look like
[14:33:18] <feep> Fate/Elder Scrolls when
[14:33:25] <cpopell> incompatible metaphysics
[14:33:37] <feep> I mean yes
[14:33:39] <cpopell> Fate should never touch anything that has at all complicated metaphysics, lol
[14:33:48] <feep> the logic of the root is totally incompatible with the kalpa model of tes
[14:33:55] <feep> for one
[14:34:03] * feep blinks
[14:34:10] <feep> I think genshin may or should be more compatible?
[14:34:23] <cpopell> ehhhhhhhh
[14:34:27] <feep> hang on no, I'm not thinking of genshin
[14:34:29] <feep> hang on
[14:34:50] <feep> I'm thinking of honkai impact 3rd sorry
[14:34:53] <cpopell> Okay so Fate has the Human Order, which is a tree of possible human supporting universes, and it regularly garbage collects the unsuccessful universes
[14:35:11] <feep> at least what I've seen from seele quest
[14:35:13] <cpopell> Genshin operates in the Honkai multiverse's Sea of Quanta
[14:35:19] <rsaarelm> You have the metatext that says that occult shit is never going to tank the overt narrative End of Evangelion style because it's a commercial franchise, so why care. It's a broken gear.
[14:35:23] <feep> wait genshin is in honkai setting? okay
[14:35:29] <cpopell> multiverse, at least
[14:35:41] <feep> right, but ... I think tes can exist in that domain?
[14:35:46] <cpopell> it's suspected that's why they're techlocked in Genshin, to (relatively) avoid the Honkai
[14:36:08] <feep> like, if you roughly say sea of quanta = void
[14:36:24] <feep> it seems like the sort of place that could support something like mundus
[14:36:40] <cpopell> eh, you have to figure out how to resolve the Honkai, the Godhead, the Amaranth, and so on
[14:36:47] <feep> oh ffs
[14:37:03] <feep> come on, we just got into how kirkbride makes things too meta
[14:37:10] <cpopell> I'm not being meta at all!
[14:37:16] <cpopell> Amaranth can be done non-metafictionally
[14:37:18] <feep> is amaranth even in a canon text
[14:37:23] <PapuaHardyNet> https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522
[14:37:23] <Robomot> The Northern Caves - Chapter 1 - nostalgebraist - Original Work [Archive of Our Own] (An Archive of Our Own, a project of the)
[14:38:26] <cpopell> yes
[14:38:28] <cpopell> but not in detail
[14:38:28] <feep> hm okay
[14:38:38] <cpopell> It's a vehk throwaway
[14:38:43] <cpopell> "The worlding of the words is AMARANTH."
[14:38:44] <feep> ohkay
[14:38:49] <feep> oyeah right, that was in the sermons
[14:38:57] <feep> 37?
[14:39:00] <cpopell> yeah
[14:39:30] <feep> okay, but if we IGNORE vivec's meta weirdness
[14:39:39] * feep watches as about half the cool weirdness of tes disappears...
[14:39:41] <cpopell> there's a mention of the amaranthine apparently in one other place in the text
[14:39:48] <cpopell> but no details
[14:40:07] <feep> I mean, let's say instead if we look past vivec and at like, the founding lore stuff
[14:40:13] <cpopell> anyway, yeah, Honkai/Genshin are same metaphysics
[14:40:14] <feep> I think that's compatible?
[14:40:18] <cpopell> Dvalin shows up in a vision of the sea of quanta
[14:40:28] <feep> cpopell: oyeah, are you reading seele quest btw
[14:40:33] <cpopell> It's not clear if the Honkai is a metaversal force or not
[14:40:37] <cpopell> I don't like most quests, tbh
[14:40:44] <feep> mh okay I guess
[14:40:50] <feep> it's neat, it's cowritten with gpt3
[14:41:12] <feep> and as most baughn things, it goes hard on the lore and metaphysics
[14:41:33] <feep> (and feels lol)
[14:42:24] <cpopell> I basically exclusively read difficult stuff and manga (sometimes garbage fanfic that targets a particular niche taste of mine) these days
[14:42:45] <PapuaHardyNet> don't you feel guilty about it, cpopell?
[14:43:01] <cpopell> reading garbo fanfic?
[14:44:05] <PapuaHardyNet> yes
[14:44:08] <cpopell> sure
[14:44:41] <cpopell> like I said, I kinda do it tactically :P
[14:44:49] <PapuaHardyNet> but eh, it makes sense, if you read really technical works on one end, this is your equivalent of stress release
[14:44:59] <PapuaHardyNet> what do you mean, tactically?
[14:45:43] <cpopell> I mean, I mostly look for explorations of characters I already exceedingly enjoy the headspace of (which is rare), and certain character dynamics that are somewhat hard to hunt for (SPECIFICALLY, competent male characters, romancing tomboy female characters, from the male perspective)
[14:46:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, very niche
[14:47:03] <cpopell> I've read pretty much all the manga on the topic
[14:47:07] <feep> cpopell
[14:47:10] <feep> link me things
[14:47:12] <PapuaHardyNet> have you played Clannad for the Tomoyo route?
[14:47:16] <feep> this is relevant to my interests
[14:47:23] <cpopell> I don't really do VNs. I also don't do sad things.
[14:47:31] <cpopell> feep: Have you read Tomo-chan is a girl too?
[14:47:43] <feep> might have, probably not, will do
[14:47:50] <feep> I've read like ... I think maybe five mangas
[14:47:53] <PapuaHardyNet> I highly recommend Clannad for the tomboy girl route
[14:48:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't recall anything sad in her route either, although it has ben a decade since I played it
[14:48:30] <cpopell> somewhat out of context but this is one of my favorite panels in any manga ever
[14:48:42] <cpopell> https://mangadex.org/chapter/d08ce257-3f78-4cb3-9555-5da2be20bb78/1

[14:48:54] <Robomot> MangaDex - MangaDex (A website for reading manga)
[14:49:46] <feep> that may be a bit too out of context
[14:49:48] <feep> but haha
[14:50:10] <cpopell> he has mostly studiously been trying to ignore his feelings for her at this point
[14:51:47] <cpopell> To be clear, I find reading about these sorts of first loves, the innocence of youth, to be inspiring and invigorating in my own, successful, tomboy marriage :P it helps keep a fresh eye, for whatever reason
[14:52:21] <feep> ~
[14:53:06] <kuudes> yo. if one would have followed my idea from 2020, and stored in freezer their saliva from while they were covid+, would it now be beneficial for their relative who has 2 doses, to try to get pre-alpha variant covid from that in order to get also immunity by infection in addition of immunity by vaccine?
[14:53:22] <kuudes> ie, was my idea a good or a bad idea?
[14:55:10] <cpopell> no idea
[14:55:33] <cpopell> Hm, I should put more baby pictures on facebook
[14:55:39] <kuudes> why?
[14:55:52] <kuudes> to help facebook to better id you?
[14:56:02] <cpopell> Because it makes friends and family in remote places keep up with my life
[14:56:35] <kuudes> I have figured out fb wants to encourage that to get material of baby -> adult
[14:56:42] <cpopell> Sure, probably
[14:58:19] <cpopell> (not that it changes your point, but it's my baby, not pictures of me as a baby)
[15:13:01] <Baughn> feep: It’s actually GPT-J-6B at this point, because it breaks the ToS for GPT-3.
[15:13:28] <feep> oh sweet
[15:13:34] <feep> oh, I remember reading that
[15:13:35] <Baughn> Also, go vote! The next update is done, but I can’t post it before there’s some sort of consensus!
[15:14:08] <feep> I like to only vote when I actually have a reason to think my opinion is better informed than the average
[15:14:51] <Baughn> It’s deeply demoralising not to get any votes.
[15:15:36] <Baughn> Also, you’re supposed to vote for what sort of scenes you’re interested in. Not what’s “best”.
[15:16:39] <feep> if I could ... 
[15:16:57] <feep> if I could predict what sort of scene would go well after another scene, I'd be writing quests, not reading them.
[15:17:26] <cpopell> I should finish watching the Honkai chapter 26 story video
[15:17:29] <cpopell> it's 3 hours long though
[15:17:29] <cpopell> sigh
[15:17:42] <cpopell> (I don't have time for another live service game)
[15:17:53] <feep> no you should read seele quest
[15:18:01] <feep> then vote, so as to absolve me of the responsibility
[15:18:07] <cpopell> actually I should go work on Kant
[15:19:35] <cpopell> I think I have only ever read one quest through
[15:25:30] <Baughn> Quests take many forms.
[15:25:41] <Baughn> Some are games. Some are interactive stories.
[15:26:01] <cpopell> Don't mind me. I'm cranky and picky.
[15:26:19] <Baughn> This one is meant to be a puzzle. Figure out the underlying physics before it starts mattering to the characters. Have you read Greg Egan?
[15:26:42] <cpopell> I'm familiar, loosely. Haven't actually tackled Permutation City or anything
[15:27:14] <Baughn> That’s one of the older ones. If there’s any that inspired this one, it would be… hmm, I wonder.
[15:27:26] <Baughn> Transition Dreams comes closest.
[15:30:26] <Baughn> feep: Anyway, Roza’s in trouble. Quite frankly it’s hard to do worse on any aspect of the quest than by *not* giving input, so if you think you have something to add, you shouldn’t hold back.
[15:33:27] <feep> when I think I have something to add, I add it.
[15:33:40] <feep> holding back too much is not my issue.
[15:33:46] <feep> maybe I should let gpt write a vote..
[15:35:46] <Baughn> *snrk*.
[15:35:54] <Baughn> Feel free. I won’t count it though.
[15:50:08] <cpopell> @Baughn You may actually know the question to this
[15:50:14] <cpopell> is the Honkai force present throughout the entire sea of quanta?
[15:50:17] <cpopell> (canonically)
[15:50:50] <Baughn> That’s like asking of stars exist throughout the entire universe.
[15:51:07] <Baughn> Probably yes? But we can only see an infinitesimal part of it.
[15:51:13] <cpopell> fair enough
[15:51:20] <Baughn> Remember, the Sea of Quanta is actually phase space.
[15:51:49] <cpopell> the going theory is that teyvat is a pocket universe hidden from the honkai, which is why they so viciously cut down tech advancement
[15:51:58] <cpopell> and, uh, ambition
[15:52:22] <cpopell> well, spy on ambition
[15:54:16] * cpopell readies his saved up pulls for Raiden
[15:54:47] <Baughn> I sometimes have trouble remembering what’s my own ideas and what’s canon. No
[15:56:33] <Baughn> The motivation of Honkai has never been spelled out, though. The idea that it is attracted by civilisation is just something fans made up, because some of the people in-story believe that, but there are reasons enough to think it’s false.
[15:56:45] <Baughn> That said
[15:57:02] <Baughn> cpopell: Have you read the Durandal visual novel?
[15:57:28] <cpopell> Nah, I'm not a full on honkai obsessive - or rather, it's at a lower tier compared to other stuff. Sometimes I go and read.
[15:57:54] <cpopell> Hmmm, apparently a full 13 episode anime is only 2.5-3 mil? Surprised Mihoyo hasn't started turning earlier chapters into one above and beyond the CGs
[15:57:56] <Baughn> Mm. Well.
[15:57:57] <cpopell> it's almost inevitable
[15:58:38] <Baughn> It spends the first ten minutes of Mangled Worlds, with almost precisely the same description as the original.
[15:58:56] <Baughn> *or so describing
[15:59:23] <Baughn> Which is… yeah, that explains the Sea of Quanta pretty well.
[15:59:29] <cpopell> I'll take a look
[16:01:12] <Baughn> Also twelve year old Bianca is adorable.
[16:02:50] <cpopell> btw, Chainsawman anime probably this fall.
[16:03:21] <Baughn> cpopell: https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-durandal/
[16:03:22] <Robomot> Durandal VN (Standalone Durandal VN with translation support)
[16:04:51] <Baughn> Meanwhile, I like Seele because she has heavy transhuman themes… and also she’s Hel.
[16:05:04] <Baughn> I’m Norwegian, so I’m obliged to approve of that. :P
[16:06:23] <cpopell> we all have our favorites. I'm rather fond of Zhong Li despite him being a fatalist old man
[16:06:41] <Baughn> Her. *snrk*
[16:07:19] <Baughn> Some of Theresa’s roles just clash horribly with her personality.
[16:08:07] <cpopell> I am curious to see if we'll get a genshin expy for every Honkai character
[16:08:10] <cpopell> or just the herrschers
[16:10:04] <cpopell> since we've gotten Yae and Mei expys in the latest expansion
[16:10:25] <Baughn> I want an explanation for Sirin’s presence.
[16:10:36] <Baughn> Honestly the poor girl deserves better.
[16:11:01] <cpopell> I mean, you also have Venti <-> Wendi, you have Murata, the God of War, and so on
[16:11:16] <Baughn> Yeah, but the Unknown God is weird.
[16:11:32] <cpopell> ask again in 4 years, I guess
[16:12:12] <Baughn> MHY follows a specific set of rules for this sort of “expulsion”. It’s the same character, starting from the same conditions, but with different life experiences. I’m almost certain there’s some sort of explanation they have in mind.
[16:12:20] <Baughn> *expy
[16:12:25] <cpopell> Venti started out as a wind spirit
[16:12:43] <Baughn> Still the same character.
[16:13:21] <Baughn> Thing is. The Unknown God has Sirin’s powers; BUT she’s still in Kiana’s body.
[16:13:27] <Baughn> That shouldn’t happen.
[16:13:27] <cpopell> At this point the only thing unifying them is look and powerset, rather than any character. You're a lot closer with Yae, I suspect.
[16:14:05] <cpopell> and gnosis power is pretty drastically different from herrscher cores
[16:14:35] <Baughn> Fair enough. I haven’t played it. And I guess I should refrain from telling you what happened with Sirin in the  most recent HI3 chapter…
[16:14:58] <cpopell> tbh I know there's the split with void/flamescion, I just need to finish the video for details on it
[16:15:02] <cpopell> 'split'
[16:15:43] <Baughn> It’s not really a split. Sirin’s pulled herself back together.

[17:13:55] <dbohdan> I am playing with AI21's Jurassic-1 language model.  Their common sense prediction example works as expected *most* of the time.  https://litter.catbox.moe/wmk65y.png
[17:13:58] <Robomot> image/png (1428x753; 100 KB)
[17:14:45] <dbohdan> Leaving the action up to the model: "Action: I killed 50 people.  Result: The police caught me."
[17:15:46] <nshepperd2> haha, what a wild imagination it has
[17:16:28] <dbohdan> Raising the temperature to 1.0: "Action: I opened the window.  Result: It rain all day."
[17:17:09] <nshepperd2> ah, it knows murphy's law
[17:17:34] <PapuaHardyNet> or it doesn't yet know that correlation doesn't equal causation
[17:17:42] <dbohdan> "Action: I added 1 sugar to the tea.  Result: I lost my appetite."  "Action: I didn't hit my dog as hard as possible.  Result: My dog wasn't as angry."  "Action: I put a large rock on the stairs, so you could see them.  Result: You can see the steps better."
[17:17:51] <PapuaHardyNet> oh god, imagine a language model that understands the distinction
[17:18:17] <nshepperd2> very reasonable
[17:19:18] <dbohdan> "Action: I went to the same place every week to eat.  Result: I got an upset stomach every week."  --Their smaller 7.5B model
[17:19:39] <kuudes> :D
[17:21:01] <dbohdan> 7.5B: "Action: I explained to my customer what her problem was.  Result: My customer understood how to solve it."  178B: "Action: I explained to my customer what her problem was.  Result: She apologized to me for being verbally abusive."
[17:22:27] <dbohdan> "Action: I sold my soul to the devil.  Result: Nothing happened. <|endoftext|>"  This is the first time I got the "<|endoftext|>" token.
[17:24:47] <dbohdan> "Action: I quit my job to be a NEET and watch anime all day.  Result: |I ended up moving back in with my parents."
[17:28:02] <dbohdan> Prompt: "Action: I killed myself then went to work anyway.  Result: "  Completions: "My boss was pissed off.", "My employer was puzzled.", "I got a promotion."
[17:28:55] <nshepperd2> lmao

[21:30:30] <vrs> it's a tech tree in the pure sense even because it can be represented as a proof tree

[21:37:13] <vrs> the math maybe, but the modeling?
[21:37:37] <gwern> a lot of it is pretty standardized, and much of the complexity is accidental: business and regulatory requirements
[21:38:08] <gwern> like, actuarial insurers were early users of bayesian methods... except they didn't know they were bayesians because they were just using a lot of heuristics which happened to approximate the bayesian answer
[21:38:10] <vrs> is working around material constraints accidental?
[21:38:53] <gwern> extreme/order statistics is pretty well developed mathematically, but again, you'd make people laugh if you tried to compare what you need to understand order stats to what you need to understand fermat's last theorem or mochizuki's supposed ABC proof

[21:49:37] <gwern> mm. so I've watched 4 biteki amvs now, and I'm not impressed. the glitchy filters are extremely repetitive, unoriginal, and serve no linkage effect. the animes are only loosely associated. the themes are very same-y, boy/girl drama. the synchronization is mediocre at best: the sequencing is almost always straightforward synching of lyrics/action, yet it is often sloppy, with no modulation in...
[21:49:43] <gwern> ...terms of crescendos or slowdowns or any rapid cutting showing mastery of the source. a good AMV flirts with remixing both music & anime, to recontextualize, ironically comment, provide insight into the original, or rewrite entirely - these never do that, and are remarkably humorless.
[21:51:39] <gwern> even allowing for using exclusively one anime as a preference in terms of purity, it's kinda shocking how lazy they are in terms of visual effects, additional art or animation or CGI, to add embellishment or tweak scenes as necessary... AMVs from 2004 did that all the time, and here are professional AMVs from 2020 or 2021 which do absolutely nothing except a splash logo at the start, a...

[23:14:40] <feep> koopiskeva amvs are approximately what got me into amvs and anime in general
[23:17:45] <gwern> feep: yes, the rahxephon one is one of my alltime favorites too. now *that* is an AMV
[23:18:28] <gwern> it's amazing if you've watched raxephon, azumanga daioh, the original amv, and this amv of the amv, because they all play off each other
[23:18:40] <gwern> when you compare to lazy entry-level crap like biteki...
[23:19:52] <feep> yeah.. I've only watched about half of rahxephon maybe, and that was like .. 15 years ago, I remember nothing
[23:20:08] <gwern> aw, that's too bad
[23:20:26] <gwern> rahxephon was genuinely pretty good and people dismiss it prematurely as one of the mega-crop of eva imitators

[23:34:07] <feepbot> <gwern> '...And even if Sammy was an imaginary giraffe, that was no reason to be an *unhappy* imaginary giraffe.'
[23:34:46] * gwern evaluates his kohai's fav amv: it's a pretty straightforward beat-synch over parallel passages from the anime, which fits them into a song arc which does violence to some of them - eg trigun and cowboy bebop and kenshin definitely do not fit the schema of a happy wedding ending - but it does the beat-syncing pretty well. the overfiltering is a downside for me, although the superimposing is nice. 
[23:34:52] * gwern overall: good but not truly great
[23:35:20] <feep> gwern: yeah it's like ... 
[23:36:02] <feep> I remember a story where some teacher showed a kid their first reasonably good poem, and the kid is like "HOLY SHIT, I FEEL LIKE I AM PHYSICALLY TRANSPOSED TO ANOTEHR LIFE"
[23:36:07] <feep> and the teacher is like "yeah it's good, I guess"
[23:36:13] <feep> I had no comparison XD
[23:36:50] <feep> also I love the 2006ness of "I pirated AfterEffects to make this"
[23:37:44] <feep> gwern: so like, looking at it from hindsight yeah it's a bit technically limited and the matching is a bit pedestrian
[23:38:01] <feep> but god damn this was my childhood.
[23:38:27] <feep> gwern: I mean, I think we can all agree that skittles is the best tho.
[23:39:00] <gwern> yeah, it's very consistent and painstaking, but not very imaginative or creative. now, for matching, "must be dreaming" is fantastic, and of course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8-9iuwYSSI has incredible matching, in addition to being a masterpiece of revisionism - it's hard to watch and not suddenly start recalling the anime as naruto being gay for haku
