[10:40:00] <no_gravity> Good Morning! Why does the span overflow the div here? https://jsfiddle.net/mbdwtyg4/
[10:43:08] <DPA> I'm not sure about the rationale, but it just happens with inline elements in block elements. You can make the span "display: inline-block;", or put an element around it that is.
[10:43:30] <no_gravity> DPA: Yeah, funky.
[10:43:55] <no_gravity> I noticed that it does not happen with inline-block elements too.
[10:44:06] <no_gravity> And I also wonder what the rationale is :)
[10:44:24] <thykka> what would you expect to happen?
[10:44:29] <thykka> it's an inline element
[10:44:47] <no_gravity> And why do inline elements overflow?
[10:45:09] *** Joins: fweht (uid404746@id-404746.lymington.irccloud.com)
[10:45:46] <fweht> is it possible to use variables in svg filters, i saw something like `[amount]` being used in the filter code but `filter: url(#myFilter)(50)` didn't work for me
[10:46:04] <thykka> no_gravity, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Block_and_Inline_Layout_in_Normal_Flow
[10:46:06] <thykka> “In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a containing block. Horizontal margins, borders, and padding are respected between these boxes. The boxes may be aligned vertically in different ways: their bottoms or tops may be aligned, or the baselines of text within them may be aligned. The rectangular area that contains the boxes
[10:46:08] <thykka> that form a line is called a line box.”
[10:46:39] <thykka> it's just how inline elements are specified to work
[10:47:25] <no_gravity> thykka: Hmm.. that seems to be about alignment but not about overflow?
[10:48:04] <thykka> it's implicit
[10:48:24] <thykka> overflow is overflow, and not related specifically to inline elements
[10:48:41] <thykka> you could put an <img> there and it would overflow in a similar manner
[10:48:54] <thykka> or an SVG with a smaller viewbox than it's contents

I have <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"></meta>, width works fine, but the height gets a scrollbar (maybe due to the URL bar at the top or the phone's navigation bar at the bottom). is there a way to tell the browser: make this as large as you can without adding a scrollbar?

[17:09:12] <ecraven> works "fullscreen" on firefox on PC, but on fennec on my mobile phone, it shows a vertical scrollbar
[17:09:31] <ecraven> I'd like to *not* show that scrollbar ;) and automatically adjust the size when the nav-bar or system-bar is shown / hidden
[17:09:34] <ecraven> is that even possible?
[17:11:55] <hassoon> ecraven: .card > .categorydetails breaks causing the last O to be visible in a new line
[17:12:06] <hassoon> producing that scrollbar in consequence
[17:12:20] <ecraven> hm.. not on my phone, but I'll fix that
[17:12:56] <hassoon> ecraven: nah it is
[17:13:02] <ecraven> I've added overflow: hidden to all grid-areas
[17:13:12] <hassoon> ecraven: write 0/0/0/0/0 instead of 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
[17:13:31] <hassoon> those spaces will make the text larger and have it break to a new line
[17:13:55] <hassoon> unless you force it to stay on one line, but you'll sacrifice the last few characters by hiding them
[17:14:12] <ecraven> done, changed
[17:14:13] <hassoon> using a text-overflow:hidden approach

[17:17:49] <ecraven> the lower "line" is missing (maybe hidden by the system bar)
[17:19:35] <hassoon> ecraven: maybe that line is native to the phone UI system and it overlays the browser, otherwise does it force a scrollbar to appear ?
[17:20:14] <ecraven> hm.. actually, there is no scrollbar, but I still can scroll on that page
[17:20:32] <ecraven> it doesn't disappear either, so it seems 100vh is *not* actually 100vh on this phone :-/
[17:20:40] <ecraven> is there any better unit than vh that I could use?
[17:21:24] <hassoon> ecraven: i think you're not scrolling within the browser window
[17:21:27] <hmw[at]> 100%
[17:21:30] <hassoon> ecraven: but within the phone UI
[17:21:38] <hmw[at]> ^
[17:21:39] <hassoon> ecraven: so that you can hide the uppser address bar
[17:21:45] <hassoon> ecraven: happens in my phone in that way
[17:21:48] <hassoon> hi hmw[at]
[17:21:50] <ecraven> so there's no way around this?
[17:22:24] <ecraven> ah, hmw[at] thanks, 100% looks to be better
[17:22:44] <ecraven> hm.. so it was that simple after all... sorry for the noise, and thanks very much for the help!
[17:22:46] <hmw[at]> hi hassoon
[17:22:52] <hassoon> 100%? what 100%
[17:23:41] <ecraven> I changed it to 100% instead of 100vh
[17:23:49] <hassoon> i don't see a scrollbar in my phone nor in my desktop-browser's mobile-mode simulator
[17:24:23] <ecraven> it's not a scrollbar, it just scrolls
[17:24:27] <ecraven> but not with 100%
[17:24:30] <ecraven> only with 100vh
[17:24:38] <ecraven> so, this solves my problem, I think. thank you very much!

[20:08:47] <gamara> hey so I was wondering how can I make my periods center inside the <p> element as right now they look weird? https://jsfiddle.net/istareatscreens/03yag2xn/
[20:09:09] <gamara> also any tips for prevent incorrect font flash?
[20:09:44] <gamara> like for example the . is at the bottom of the <p> container it is in so when it transforms in and out its moving upwards
[20:09:51] <gamara> I want it to just move from the spot it is at
[20:09:57] <gamara> would I have to rewrite hte keyframe?
[20:12:30] <msfninja> is that css?
[20:13:17] <gamara> yes
[20:13:19] <gamara> scss
[20:13:21] <gamara> and html
[20:13:35] <msfninja> ah sass
[20:13:59] <msfninja> the fiddle loaded with css set initially
[20:15:44] <gamara> oh sorry
[20:15:55] <gamara> https://jsfiddle.net/istareatscreens/03yag2xn/6/
[20:15:59] <gamara> here is the most recent
[20:16:11] <gamara> I dont know how to make the periods fade in and out in place
[20:16:20] <gamara> because they sit in the bottom of their <p> box
[20:20:05] <msfninja> this is not really a scss fix, but you can consider using interpuncts instead of periods
[20:20:13] <msfninja> interpunct: ·
[20:20:20] <gamara> oh
[20:20:28] <gamara> i didnt know about an interpunct lol
[20:20:53] <gamara> I guess I would have to make htem relative?

[20:22:16] <gamara> how would I move them down to the right location
[20:22:36] <gamara> display relative?
[20:23:10] <msfninja> you can add a translate() transform in addition to the scale()

[20:47:57] <Rockwood> really
[20:48:01] <Rockwood> i love PHP
[20:48:09] <gamara> yeah im using rachet
[20:48:22] <gamara> this is my first php program
[20:48:36] <gamara> i did the backend in php frontend is all react
[20:48:48] <Rockwood> react gr8
[20:49:18] <gamara> PHP seems fine I just feel like setting up debugging in it is kind of a nightmare
[20:50:32] <msfninja> i used php a little bit then got told that its outdated and rather switch to something more modern like vue.js or node.js
[20:50:35] <gamara> thank you so much for the help msfninja
[20:50:40] <gamara> you are awesome
[20:51:01] <gamara> I think php is widely used
[20:51:16] <gamara> still but yeah I think most people seem to like node or asp.net
[20:51:52] <msfninja> gamara: no problem
[20:52:07] <gamara> now I need to figure out how you did it lol
[20:53:46] <msfninja> i wrapped the interpuncts in a div box (#dots-wrapper), and positioned that div box inside the &__message, (position: absolute and bottom: -15%)
[20:54:01] <gamara> ok that is obvious haha
[20:54:12] <gamara> i always get confused about relative and absolute positioning
[20:54:22] <gamara> i thought relative was relative to the inner container
[20:54:42] <Rockwood> test once and make yourself confidence
[20:54:51] <msfninja> yea, parent should be relative, child should be absolute
[20:54:52] <gamara> I feel at least with me I relearn things in css 50 times
[20:55:06] <gamara> and still dontremember them lol
[20:55:55] <gamara> is it alright to use CSS grid?

[21:23:03] <SpeakerToMeat> Hi all.
[21:27:47] <SpeakerToMeat> I'm working with some pre-made stuff, doign changes and fixes etc.... I'm using a slider (carrousel) "element" (a set of divs, it's a wordpress element). and on this bootstrap based theme I'm having a problem. When in mobile part of the image sides (mostly) is eaten away. Instead of the whole image showing, smaller... I tried putting on a min-width on the outer div, but of course this makes it bigger
[21:27:49] <SpeakerToMeat> than the context, and the image shows full size (instead of reduced) and I can see even less of course.
[21:28:29] <SpeakerToMeat> My question is, what is (or are) the property that lets the image be slightly larger than the li/ul/div around the image, and crop into what's shown?
[21:35:40] <hmw[at]> SpeakerToMeat: https://jsfiddle.net/f8Lvsrax/
[21:36:46] <SpeakerToMeat> The structure is div->div->ul->li, the second div in the chain has an overflow: hidden and I wonder if that's it, but what determines the backgound image in the li is overflowing? and, if I change (live) that hidden to visible, I still get the crop.

[21:37:19] <SpeakerToMeat> One second please my internet is horrible
[21:38:50] <SpeakerToMeat> hmw[at], ok it does have to do with overflow then.
[21:39:07] <SpeakerToMeat> And if setting my overflow to visible is not working, it's probable another element on top of this stack is munging it.
[21:39:44] <SpeakerToMeat> let me check all the stack of this element again to see if I do have height/width elements and what are they
[21:40:21] <SpeakerToMeat> The image is not being done via an img but via background-image: in the li.
