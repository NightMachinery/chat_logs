[02:20:40] <Lutin> gordonjcp how do you mean come into it ?
[02:24:06] <gordonjcp> Lutin: well, what part of this are you using a VPN for?
[02:24:53] <Lutin> gordonjcp the idea is to be able to connect to my containers directly
[02:25:04] <Lutin> but then I'm stuck because of the routing
[02:25:56] <gordonjcp> connect what to your containers directly?
[02:26:50] <Lutin> just whatever I run in them, so on their IP that they get from IPAM
[02:27:04] <gordonjcp> well you can specify the IP address of the container
[02:27:15] <gordonjcp> and the subnet of the network it attaches to
[02:27:39] <gordonjcp> by default it doesn't do this, it'll create an RFC1918 network for each compose project
[02:28:03] <gordonjcp> but this is generally a fairly crazy idea
[02:29:29] <Lutin> gordonjcp no that is not the issue but the issue is... a VPN client gets an IP from the VPN server... then you have a routing issue as the container on the same network doesn't know anything about the VPN client IP.

[02:41:33] <gordonjcp> so
[02:41:37] <gordonjcp> you're running a VPN
[02:41:42] <gordonjcp> remote machines connect to the VPN
[02:42:02] <gordonjcp> then you want to connect from a remote machine across a VPN, to a particular container assuming you know its IP address?

[02:50:38] <gordonjcp> Lutin: I mean this in the nicest possible way
[02:50:50] <Lutin> what is ?
[02:51:09] <Lutin> I don't care about the IP... I care about the route...
[02:51:21] <gordonjcp> Lutin: there is such a tremendous impedance mismatch between what you are trying to do and how Docker is intended to be used, that I suspect if you get it working you'd be able to write quite a fat O'Reilly book about it.
[02:52:22] <Lutin> gordonjcp yes the issue is indeed that docker is not capable of doing so... but I try to find a way so I can
[02:54:13] <gordonjcp> Lutin: what are you actually connecting to on the containers?
[02:54:28] <gordonjcp> Lutin: really you ought to be defining the ports that you want to expose, and just connecting to the host
[02:55:04] <Lutin> gordonjcp some won't be exposed on/to the host
[02:55:49] <gordonjcp> Lutin: have you considered just using lxc directly?
[02:56:08] <Lutin> gordonjcp nope because I need swarm
[02:56:20] <gordonjcp> okay, but swarm doesn't work that
[02:56:23] <gordonjcp> *that way
[02:56:38] <Lutin> I can connect to the LB IP
[02:56:41] <gordonjcp> I don't really get what kind of problem you're trying to solve with this
[02:57:02] <Lutin> simple... access my private container IP's over VPN
[02:57:08] <aab_> When you are running a vpn as long as you can communicate with LAN address on same network then you should be able to connect to the dockerip:port
[02:57:38] <aab_> there is no difference to any other machine on the network over VPN apart from it’s in a docker container or swarm or whatever it is
[02:57:39] *** Quits: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[02:57:46] <Lutin> aab_ I don't want to connect to the host(port)
[02:57:49] <gordonjcp> Lutin: access the container IPs in what sense?
[02:58:13] <Lutin> gordonjcp see it like this... docker is NAT... host is your modem/WAN... I want to be on LAN
[02:58:16] <Lutin> using VPN
[02:58:26] <aab_> What are you wanting to connect to then 
[02:58:49] <gordonjcp> Lutin: that makes no sense
[02:58:51] <Lutin> just the service on the container, is that so strange ?
[02:58:56] <gordonjcp> WHAT SERVICE
[02:58:57] <gordonjcp> fuck me
[02:59:01] <gordonjcp> this is like pulling teeth
[02:59:03] <Lutin> whatever runs in that container
[02:59:10] <Lutin> doesn't matter
[02:59:21] <gordonjcp> it doesn't make any sense to do that
[02:59:39] <Lutin> sure it does... I can have mutltiple machines with the same port
[02:59:42] <Lutin> containers
[02:59:50] <Lutin> without "NATTING" them over different ports
[03:03:40] <aab_> You can’t have outside:inside same ports and working otherwise the port will be in use and the container won’t start
[03:04:10] <aab_> you can have outsideport:insideport where as outside port is different 
[03:04:10] <Lutin> No that is why I said WITHOUT NATTING
[03:05:07] <aab_> your not natting you just assign the port.  Example 9999:1000 or 9998:1000 where as 1000 is the inside docker port.
[03:06:09] <aab_> 9999 or 9998 could be two different containers on outside ports for example.
[03:06:20] <Lutin> which is the same as natting
[03:06:38] <Lutin> doesn't matter I don't want to use the host for it
[03:06:46] <gordonjcp> Lutin: so
[03:07:02] <Lutin> gordonjcp so what ?
[03:07:04] <gordonjcp> Lutin: manually define the subnet for each group of containers, manually assign IP addresses to them
[03:07:32] <Lutin> gordonjcp the assignment is not the issue... the route to the VPN client is the issue
[03:07:39] <aab_> Leave docker to manage that I don’t know what your trying to achieve here
[03:07:43] <Lutin> the container doesn't know that route
[03:08:17] <Lutin> aab_ or you are not really into L3/L4 and L7 networking or you dont want to understand it if you ask me
[03:09:43] <aab_> I do understand it, you would need to add a static route if that’s the case.  Same as router static routes
[03:10:11] <gordonjcp> which is starting to sound like inventing something that's entirely the opposite of Docker, but on Docker
[03:10:25] <Lutin> ok nice aab_ but as most images don't have much networktools... I'm looking for more ways :)
[03:10:39] <gordonjcp> I don't get what problem this solves
[03:10:46] <Lutin> gordonjcp you can eay soup with a fork as well... if you want
[03:11:09] <Lutin> gordonjcp not a problem, more a way of doing things
[03:11:16] <gordonjcp> Lutin: so if Docker is so unsuitable for what you're trying to do, why are you trying to use it?
[03:12:11] <Lutin> gordonjcp for the same thing everyone else is using it for ?
[03:12:41] <gordonjcp> Lutin: no-one is using it in the way you describe
[03:13:39] <aab_> Ok then

If django sets a cookie, I can't see it at all on the SPA. I think django is setting cookies from the wrong domain since it's running on 0.0.0.0:8000 or something and my SPA is just on 0.0.0.0
[05:53:46] <Batzy> any ideas how to get around this extremely annoying cookie issue

[06:22:08] <rawtaz> perhaps you should check with the django folks, after all it shouldnt matter a bit what port and ip the service listens on
[06:22:10] <Batzy> somehow too, i need to explicitly set options django claims to set by default
[06:22:15] <Batzy> yeah django doesnt give a shit
[06:22:55] <rawtaz> did you try the irc channel? im assuming there is one somewhere

[06:23:35] <Batzy> man the cookie is set but
[06:23:36] <Batzy> only sometimes

[06:23:57] <rawtaz> hum.
[06:24:39] <Batzy> rawtaz heres something interesting
[06:24:53] <Batzy> if i click a button on my SPA to redirect to /login, the cookie doesnt work

[06:25:03] <Batzy> the cookie is set
[06:25:05] <Batzy> ???????????????
[06:25:36] <rawtaz> are you using your browser's dev tools to inspect what's sent and so on from the server?
[06:26:08] <Batzy> yeah
[06:26:11] <Batzy> this is really weird
[06:28:43] <Batzy> i am so confused

[08:49:44] <kevr> I have a Python application that I've installed in my Docker container. I have a docker-compose server named `git` that runs sshd, and it defines an AuthorizedKeysCommand, which is a python script (that was installed via the installation)
[08:50:07] <kevr> If I login, sshd does not seem to keep PYTHONPATH information properly about where packages are installed on the system
[08:50:13] <kevr> (if i login via ssh, that is)
[08:50:38] <kevr> But, I can force it to if I force those env vars in front of the AuthorizedKeysCommand.
[08:50:44] <kevr> Any clue how I could fix this issue?
[08:51:14] <kevr> The problem is that, the AuthorizedKeysCommand script also executes some other scripts that use the same package, and when that happens, those modules can't find the package.
[08:51:27] <kevr> So even if I force set it with leading vars, I get breakage.
[08:52:59] <kevr> With executing `env` in my entrypoint, I do get "git_1            | PYTHONPATH=/aurweb:/aurweb/app" which is good, because I installed the application into /aurweb/app here.
[08:58:25] <tabakhase> kevr where from are the envs you want to keep into what?
[08:58:54] <kevr> tabakhase: say what?
[08:59:42] <tabakhase> sounds like a) not a docker thing, b) a flag in sshdaemon to keep/what to keep likely exists... c) if you want to workaround it cause b) doesnt exist, write it out with a docker-entrypoint maybe? smells tho...
[09:01:13] * kevr doesn't understand anything you're saying
[09:02:26] <tabakhase> a) "your entrypoint sees the var? - cool. not a docker problem then"
[09:02:42] <kevr> ah ++

[09:04:07] <kevr> Yeah. The env vars are all legit. Now I'm dealing with a different kind of error, but I've gotten further here.
[09:04:32] <tabakhase> b) sshd prob has a way to influence that... stuff like .profile only gets read for an actual shell... - how do you start sshd right now? would expect there be a way to pass it...
[09:04:53] <tabakhase> c) - if b) is not a thing, ~/.ssh/environment or such exists i think (and your entry would have to pop that file)
[09:05:06] <kevr> I'm literally just using `/usr/sbin/sshd -e -p 2222 -D` right now.
[09:05:14] <kevr> (in a service command)
[09:06:06] <tabakhase> "service command" as in "in a service command: blcok in a compose file"? - or as in like, youre running a init in the container that runs the service sshd? (and soemthing else?) --- just to be sure...
[09:06:27] <kevr> a docker-compose service.
[09:07:27] <tabakhase> kk, all good then =)
[09:08:13] <kevr> tabakhase: Let me try a few things out here, then spend some better amount of time collecting legit info for you on the current state of what's going on. Some things have just changed, so I don't want to keep chasing the tail around when it may be another animal now
[09:08:23] <kevr> i appreciate your help & effort <3
[09:09:23] <tabakhase> ye.. try putting some stuff in /etc/environment and such and see if its read... SSHD itself should certainly be getting those vars if your entry can print em - just doesnt pass em on...
[09:10:10] <tabakhase> (what, for 99% is the right choice obvs. just doesnt fit you there :D)
[09:10:39] *** jazzy3 is now known as jazzy
[09:10:54] <tabakhase> last resort to directly whack em with into the autorized_keys file...
[09:11:53] <tabakhase> sshd_config certainly has "SetEnv NAME=VALUE" too
[09:17:38] <kevr> ++
[09:20:37] <kevr> Now I'm getting this "Unsafe AuthorizedKeysCommand" but it's all executable and owned by the executing user...
