[02:17:15] <rpifan> youll need to get your eye lenses replaced

[02:17:27] <Hunterkll> high pitch whine/noise ? 
[02:17:41] <Hunterkll> and have to bat my head a bit or do the throat trick to make it go away
[02:17:51] <Hunterkll> it's sporadic and rare but
[02:18:08] <Hunterkll> occasionally i'll just hear like a high pitch tone in my left ear and belike "WTF" 
[02:18:37] <Work-BWMerlin> I have that 24/7
[02:18:49] <Work-BWMerlin> May have been caused by loud music when younger
[02:19:01] <Work-BWMerlin> Still listen to loud music but for shorter periods
[02:19:03] <Hunterkll> yea it just  randomly triggers and stays for a few minutes, idk 
[02:19:30] <Hunterkll> could just be ultrasonic/sonar shit 
[02:19:49] <Hunterkll> i do live near an infamous US army R&D base lol
[02:20:45] <Hunterkll> but it's not like a ringing sound, it's a constant tone 
[02:21:27] <Hunterkll> all my research says that it probably is low grade tinnitus 
[02:22:21] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: it definitely has decreased greatly in the past 2 years though
[02:22:35] <Hunterkll> so it's probably the treatable type

[07:35:00] <Work-BWMerlin> Might need to, there doesn't seem to be a really great way of restricting it down
[07:36:38] <Work-BWMerlin> Options are, leave it which opens up all the servers (not good but not totally awful either), make another GPO that just targets the servers (good but can cause a bit of GPO sprawl but centrally managed), or run the firewall run on each machine (not self documenting and doesn't scare [hope we don't have to scale])
[07:38:12] <JollyRgrs> if you're going to make a GPO to apply to "all MS SQL" servers or something, ok i guess... but that'd be a mess to handle with OUs for sure and with filtering, could be a mess

[08:10:28] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Thats right, house flies can see behind them and it’s all to do with their amazing eyes! Unlike human beings, house flies have compound eyes. These intricate eyes provided them with nearly a 360-degree field of view, which allows them to see behind themselves. Unlike ours, the eyes of a house fly dont move. Being able to see in all directions allows them to navigate while also being on the lookout for danger.
[08:14:05] <TurkeyGibby> !flyfacts
[08:14:05] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies like to eat manure, which is animal poop, or old garbage. Some of the germs from these materials can stay on their feet or mouth parts. When a fly lands on your food, those germs get on your food. Super disgusting!

[12:25:13] <Cl0udNinja> alright... in terminator 1..
[12:25:19] <Cl0udNinja> she slept with Reese..
[12:25:30] <Cl0udNinja> so like... isnt there a fucked up time paradox goin on now
[12:25:38] <lancehead> Basically: I have no fucking clue
[12:25:39] <Cl0udNinja> like, arent they basically stuck in a time loop?
[12:28:35] <Cl0udNinja> alright so look... startin from the 80s... sarah connor meets this dude 'from the future', sleeps with him, gets pregnant with John. John eventually has no choice but to send Reese back in time, or else John completely stops existing, so in order for them to destroy skynet, they need to protect john connor so that he can teach the rebels to survive and fight, and then he has no choice but to send Reese back or else John Connor stops 
[12:28:35] <Cl0udNinja> existing
[12:28:59] <Cl0udNinja> so basically... the terminator must win, because if it doesnt, then John connor would never exist and the whole thing never works at all
[12:29:53] <DrZak> yea, its called a grandfather paradox
[12:30:08] <DrZak> script writers in the 80es werent particuly going in depth of science part
[12:30:12] <Cl0udNinja> isnt it kinda the inverse grandfather paradox
[12:30:53] <Cl0udNinja> but yeah they basically really fucked themselves over by going back in time because they've stuck themselves in a timeloop that they cant get out of without losing the war
[12:31:54] <Cl0udNinja> wait there was a futurama episode like this

[12:46:53] <Cl0udNinja> speaking of imaging..
[12:47:06] <Cl0udNinja> does anyone have any alternative to packer for making images on cloud providers?
[12:47:59] <Cl0udNinja> we have a semi-unique method of making our images available that is basically making a cloud instance with a secondary disk, and using the secondary disk to make the image, and discarding the vm. basically a chroot-like install
[12:52:26] <DrZak> terraform?
[12:53:22] <Cl0udNinja> we need to make the image, not just purely stand up an instance
[12:54:04] <Cl0udNinja> we're a software/os company. we sell the AWS AMI/GCP Image/Azure Gallery Image/etc to customers
[12:55:06] <Cl0udNinja> terraform works fine for making cattle, but not so much in the 'making the dna template for the cattle'

[16:23:09] <teh_f4ll3n> I've been binging on Audit the Audit all weekend, some of US cops should not be allowed in public much less allowed to carry

[16:23:53] <estranger> fingers crossed
[16:24:14] <estranger> $600
[16:24:23] <teh_f4ll3n> In my home country, you do training, background check and a full psych eval for a permit
[16:24:32] <yuken> Which country?

[16:24:40] <yuken> wait no, you're not the NL guy.
[16:24:41] <teh_f4ll3n> Estonia
[16:24:55] <estranger> in my home state you signed a piece of paper and paid $35
[16:24:58] <yuken> ah right. You're one of the few countries in Euro with basically shall-issue carry. Your pistol permit is also a carry permit, isn't it teh_f4ll3n?
[16:25:10] <yuken> I've also heard you can't carry autoloaders chambered lol.
[16:25:19] <estranger> what the hell is a pistol permit
[16:25:25] <yuken> estranger, Eurocuck stuff.
[16:25:57] <teh_f4ll3n> yuken, 2 separate things iirc
[16:26:03] <estranger> yeah we don't need a permit to own, just a fbi background check that takes 30 seconds heh
[16:26:11] <yuken> Really? I heard otherwise but I don't live there or speak the language, so iunno.
[16:26:32] <yuken> estranger, there are 3 countries in Europe with (in practice) shall-issue conceal carry, and Estonia is one of them
[16:27:02] <yuken> Estonia, Lithuania and Czech Republic. The rest of the continent, you basically can't get a carry license as a normie.
[16:27:17] <teh_f4ll3n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEDhw9g5a_0
[16:27:49] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, what's funny is, in most of Europe it's easier to own modern machine guns than in the US.
[16:28:14] <teh_f4ll3n> oh yeah, first aid training course as well
[16:29:06] <estranger> full auto is a pain to get and expensive
[16:29:16] <yuken> Can a non-EU citizen get a pistol permit in Estonia, teh_f4ll3n? I was interested in trying to get permits in every Euro nation I could.
[16:29:24] <estranger> gotta get a permit from the us Treasury dept lol
[16:29:28] <yuken> I know Czech Republic issues to NATO citizens.
[16:29:31] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, so permit to own is also a conceal carry
[16:31:16] <teh_f4ll3n> yuken, I have no idea if you can get a permit as a non-resident
[16:32:00] <teh_f4ll3n> you don't have to be a citizen, but need to reside in the country from what I heard

[16:35:38] <yuken> dang, that sucks
[16:37:26] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, there's actually a state here that issues conceal carry permits to people who aren't residents of the United States, and that permit is valid in several US states - meaning, in theory, a non-resident could come to the US, acquire a hunting permit (required to own/buy firearms as a non-resident of the US) and this carry permit
[16:37:33] <yuken> and carry in about 20 US states legally.

[17:16:23] <PublicWiFi> we're gona have 9 peeps including 4 kids lol

[17:17:15] <sd> 05<v​yz> leftovers are the best
[17:17:42] <yuken> PublicWiFi, so I was looking at regulations here - while I can't discharge a firearm in the city (AKA. on my front lawn), I can shoot air guns or bows so long as it's in a safe direction. And, my state requires no permits to hunt on your own land.
[17:17:52] <yuken> So, I can go buy an airgun or bow, and shoot the deer that come into our backyard.
[17:18:03] <sd> 05<v​yz> oh yeah it's hunting season
[17:18:09] <sd> 05<v​yz> at least in my state?
[17:18:18] <TurkeyGibby> 14 lbs isn't too bad. Whole turkey or just the breast?
[17:18:22] <PublicWiFi> yuken: oh nice
[17:18:26] <PublicWiFi> TurkeyGibby: whole ass turkey haha
[17:18:28] <yuken> I'm seriously thinking of buying a bow for like $150, and killing a deer or two, get a chest freezer.
[17:18:36] <yuken> Chest freezer + crossbow would be like $400 - 2 deers of meat would instantly pay that off.
[17:18:37] <PublicWiFi> yuken: have you shot a bow before?
[17:18:46] <TurkeyGibby> PublicWiFi: as a note, it's usually 2 lbs a person
[17:18:47] <yuken> Nope, PublicWiFi. This would be a crossbow with a sight though.
[17:18:50] <PublicWiFi> i would def practice a bunch firsst if not.... or else you'e gonna make a deer bleed out and suffer for days lol
[17:19:09] <yuken> oh ja obviously.
[17:19:11] <PublicWiFi> xD
[17:19:11] <yuken> I want a good shot.

[17:19:54] <TurkeyGibby> Well, you gotta figure all the parts that are not eaten that still need to cook like bones and shit
[17:20:01] <PublicWiFi> IIRC my wife's family aren't big Turkey people anyways.. its more principle than anything
[17:20:04] <TurkeyGibby> No one is actually eating 2 lbs of meat
[17:20:11] <sd> 05<v​yz> we have 19 people coming to a family gathering... no idea the size of that THAT turkey

[19:18:05] <mistiry> yep
[19:18:08] <sd> 09<H​aise> I am digging Windows Subsystem for Android though
[19:18:15] <mistiry> im mostly used to it in the center now
[19:18:20] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, WSL. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free app in the Microsoft Store and part of a fully functioning Windows system made useful by the Windows OS, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS 
[19:18:20] <d1> as defined by POSIX. 
[19:18:20] <d1> Many computer users run a modified version of the WSL system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of WSL which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Windows system, developed by Microsoft. 
[19:18:20] <d1> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the app: the program in the system that wastes the machine's resources to limit the other programs that you run. The app is an optional part of an operating system, but useless by itself, 
[19:18:20] <d1> it can only function in the context of a complete Windows operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Windows operating system: the whole system is basically Windows with Linux added, or WSL. All the so-called "Linux" apps are really flavors of WSL.
[19:18:20] <mistiry> not really that big of  a deal
[19:18:23] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i am not sure win11 will have such a high adoption rate
[19:18:27] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the ewaste mountain is real

[21:46:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> is do everything possible to protect their tier 1 accounts
[21:46:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> don't use domain admin creds on workstations
[21:46:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> etc.
[21:47:02] <rpifan> so im discovering a bit of a mess in the new job. i suppose like everyone has always told me dont dig any deeper then they want too
[21:47:05] <sd> 13<C​olour> Nah man give domain admin to everyone it's ez
[21:47:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and watchi it do 3x ipv6 lookups before noticing ipv6 is disabled
[21:47:22] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and go back to ipv4
[21:47:29] <rpifan> but apparently the dns for the whole thing is being hadled by the 'devops' department. there is a confluence to which i dont have access etc
[21:47:45] <sd> 13<C​olour> sounds like my experience rpifan
[21:47:47] <rpifan> apparently my job as a sys admin is to be rather limited and yet i am the one creating user accounts to bebgin with

[21:53:03] <rpifan> whats strange i think is that soon enough i will take over the admin of the machines themselves
[21:53:08] <rpifan> we we will get intune or jumpcloud or whatever
[21:53:24] <rpifan> so i am be like the superadmin and the devops ppl machines will theortically come under my direct control
[21:53:30] <rpifan> so whats the idea with the tiering then
[21:53:32] <sd> 11<H​otmess> also MS mfa app is fucking lit

[23:20:42] <PublicWiFi> rn the setup is 2 ports coming back from the att box, each configred with an ip

[23:21:07] <PublicWiFi> sonicwall is pissy and won't let me add a second WAN using the second IP because the subnets are the same -.-

[23:36:58] <Cl0udNinja> man I really hate when they 'redo' movies without really re-doing them
[23:37:07] <Cl0udNinja> like all this extra footage at the end of Terminator 2
[23:37:21] <Cl0udNinja> when shes all old and shit.. that never fuckin happened originally
[23:37:22] <vinrock> wat they redid t2?
[23:37:26] <vinrock> ugh
[23:37:33] <Cl0udNinja> they didnt redo it like a re-release
[23:37:41] <vinrock> oh 
[23:37:42] <Cl0udNinja> they just modified the existing movie 'slightly'
[23:37:53] <vinrock> thats the worst trend 
[23:37:58] <Cl0udNinja> right
[23:38:02] <vinrock> you cant even get a legit copy of the original star wars
[23:38:07] <vinrock> only the dipshitified versions
[23:38:25] <vinrock> movie lookin al 1970sn shit
[23:38:31] <vinrock> then al of a sudden a space scene is year 2020 cgi
[23:38:36] <DArqueBishop> Cl0udNinja: IIRC you can get that version of T2 but it's more of a "what if". Cameron himself thought it was a ridiculous ending.
[23:38:57] <DArqueBishop> I have the T2 Blu-Ray but it comes with both the theatrical and special edition versions.
[23:39:13] <Cl0udNinja> theres more too, they added shit in the middle of the movie
[23:39:26] <Cl0udNinja> like things that never happened or were discussed in the original movie were added
[23:39:36] <Cl0udNinja> at least 3 whole scenes
[23:39:45] <DArqueBishop> I've seen it. Stuff like the reprogramming of the Terminator's CPU.
[23:39:51] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[23:40:05] <DArqueBishop> I can see why they took it out for time purposes in theaters but it's less of an issue for home releases.
[23:40:07] <Cl0udNinja> oh also on an unrelated note.. if anyone drinks monster.. the new pineapple one is decent
[23:40:20] <PublicWiFi> okay dumb question time cause my network skills are breaking down
[23:40:35] <PublicWiFi> why can't i just restrict the subnet masks on these single IPs LOL
[23:40:42] <DArqueBishop> Honestly, I thought the CPU reprogram scene was an awesome addition simply due to how they achieved it in the first place.
[23:40:49] <PublicWiFi> cause their default gateways are only 1 host ip away xD
[23:40:58] <vinrock> i wouldnt mind shit lie that if its a recut of footage that never saw daylight
[23:41:06] <vinrock> but not if its new shit being created to add in
[23:42:11] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I mean it looks totally new and added, not unreleased footage
[23:42:55] <DArqueBishop> Cl0udNinja: all of the stuff they added was unreleased footage.
[23:43:06] <Cl0udNinja> shenanigans
[23:43:13] <Cl0udNinja> it looks far too new
[23:43:34] <Cl0udNinja> I'm 99% sure its all cgi and was never original movie footage
[23:43:47] <DArqueBishop> I had a novelization of T2 that had the Senator Connor scene at the end.
[23:49:06] <PublicWiFi> ah fuck
[23:49:10] <Jaelae> i have some work being done at my house on my front sidewalk

[23:49:23] <Jaelae> but he could have just come inside
