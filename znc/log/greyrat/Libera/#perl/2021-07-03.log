[00:02:46] <curdlesnoot> excellent.
[00:03:18] <simcop2387> some new socket thing snuck in after some updates i guess
[00:03:55] <simcop2387> this is why i need to learn how to write ptrace stuff and setup seccomp_ptrace for the evalserver.  so i can take all the socket calls and throw them into a userspace socket library
[00:04:34] <simcop2387> i really want to give you guys access to stuff over TOR transparently without the kernel being involved
[00:04:39] <curdlesnoot> so, did you 'fake' the syscall there?
[00:05:06] <simcop2387> i made seccomp return an EINVAL for that syscall instead of killing it, pretending that the requested peer name is invalid
[00:05:18] <curdlesnoot> neat.

[00:10:34] <simcop2387> curdlesnoot: here's the changes i made, https://github.com/perlbot/evalserver-config/commit/0bec17f05e25f91a63f21678bc5a55b6612b6fd5
[00:10:34] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ update some things bash wants getpeername syscall now for whatever re… · perlbot/evalserver-confi... ]
[00:10:42] <simcop2387> along with others i hadn't committed
[00:11:15] <curdlesnoot> simcop2387: thanks. even as a relative brainlet, I think I can follow this.
[00:12:01] <simcop2387> the yaml file for seccomp rules is the most readable way i've ever had them defined, even docker's setup is worse.  that said it's still not perfect because you're essentially describing a program that's doing the filtering
[00:12:06] <curdlesnoot> at least, probably until I start reading your code.
[00:12:39] <curdlesnoot> I'm not a huge yaml fine but yes, that does look really neat.
[00:12:42] <curdlesnoot> fan, sorry.
[00:12:50] <simcop2387> i've tried a few times to make a DSL for it but i've never figured out a good syntax/style for it
[00:13:03] <Adura> Hehe, DSL
[00:13:13] <simcop2387> yea i'm not either but the structure helps considerably and will help further when i extend it to say "go tell the ptracer to handle this"
[00:14:22] <simcop2387> i might simplify it more and get rid of the idea of "profiles" for the sandbox which seemed like a better idea at the time.  in the end i've decided it's more of a burden to maintain
[00:14:51] <simcop2387> though i really like the idea of being able to restrict some things more than others still
[00:16:58] <jpmh> OK - so I tried changing $ENV{SHELL} - it does indeed change but exec still  uses sh and not my chosen shell 0 how do I change that?
[00:19:43] <simcop2387> jpmh: exec() is always going to use sh, unless you tell the exec to run another shell
[00:19:59] <simcop2387> or cmd.exe on windows i believe
[00:21:37] <simcop2387> curdlesnoot: if you ever think you can come up with a nicer way to describe a bunch of seccomp rules, i'd love to see it and integrate it.  one of the big things i added support for was for "plugins" to be able to define constants in there so that you can usually do O_DIRECT, etc. on checking arguments in syscalls.  I need to make a plugin that pulls in all the E* errno values at runtime so that
[00:21:43] <simcop2387> i don't have to look them up myself

[00:33:51] <curdlesnoot> simcop2387: ^ might be a better idea to use dash or such at some point. that way, people won't be fooled on conformance issues where they're relying on your bot and deliberately shelling out in their code.
[00:34:06] <curdlesnoot> dash does allow for some transgressions but not many.
[00:34:14] <simcop2387> if anyone is doing that then they deserve the pain :)
[00:34:26] <curdlesnoot> aw, that's mean.
[00:34:45] <curdlesnoot> it's not a common requirement but ... well.
[00:35:01] <simcop2387> if your relying on an irc bot to develop your production code then you're kinda asking for it
[00:35:04] <curdlesnoot> ok.
[00:35:10] <curdlesnoot> well, it was just a thought.
[00:36:18] <simcop2387> that said we will help you figure out what you did wrong here if you do

[00:38:16] <simcop2387> i've been slowly working on auditing what powershell on linux does to allow it to work in the bot too but that's a lot more complicated
[00:40:07] <curdlesnoot> jpmh: I thought that was made clear by my initial response and the response to ology? SHELL is for defining the login shell, nothing more.
[00:40:47] <curdlesnoot> bash is a program. if you want to execute it, tell perl you want to execute it. otherwise, what was said - and subsequently re-affirmed by simcop2387.

[19:48:04] <El_Che> LeoNerd: so, you RFC'ing all the nice Go features and porting them to Perl :P
[19:48:32] <LeoNerd> Of course
[19:48:45] <LeoNerd> Perl began by stealing all the best bits from some good langauges at the time (shell, awk, sed, ...)

[19:49:38] <LeoNerd> Yuhhuh
[19:49:43] <El_Che> go does not offer much in term of syntax, but things like defer, channels and go routines are extremely nice
[19:49:50] <LeoNerd> Yup
[19:50:02] <LeoNerd> Though my 'defer' is nicer - it's fully block-scoped, not function-scoped like Go's
[19:50:12] <LeoNerd> And I already have channels and routines - see IO::Async::Channel, IO::Async::Routine
[19:50:13] <El_Che> I just read it

[20:13:32] <xenu> LeoNerd: good thing your defer {} doesn't allow returning because no one will write an article like this about perl: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27721432

[20:14:33] <El_Che> from the thread:
[20:14:35] <El_Che> ""defer" in Go is used to catch ("recover") exceptions ("panic") which
[20:14:35] <El_Che> covers "very bad" things like memory errors (segmentation fault, etc.) so I
[20:14:35] <El_Che> think it has to be at the "end of the function" since it is basically being
[20:14:35] <El_Che> called as you go back down the stack of functions when recovering from a
[20:14:37] <El_Che> "disaster" in a called routine."
[20:14:53] <El_Che> I haven't seen go code using defer like that
[20:15:14] <El_Che> it's used pretty much as LeoNerd's examples
[20:17:08] <El_Che> if you think that defer will help you with panics, I don't want to run your code
[20:17:48] <Grinnz> Paperbot: youtube dream theater panic attack
[20:17:48] <Paperbot> Grinnz: YouTube search result: Panic Attack - published by Dream Theater - Topic - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs8rkoouPSU [ 4 more results ]
[20:18:11] <thrig> presumably you defer things long enough to golden parachute out?
[20:18:33] <El_Che> no, that's not what you do in go
[20:18:42] <Grinnz> defer { sleep 30; } # give me time to hide the bodies
[20:18:47] <El_Che> you check the error after each f* line
[20:18:57] <El_Che> and panics are panics
[20:19:13] <El_Che> I think the poster was confused with throwing stuff with Java

[23:28:42] <leitz> v`, I tend to do this in December, and call it my "New Year's Dissolutions". I stop everything possible.

[23:29:36] <leitz> v` I still sleep, go to work, and kiss my wife, but if I can stop doing something and live, I stop it. Social engagements, games, any expectations what so ever.
[23:30:27] <leitz> v` It usually takes me a week or two to decompress enough to think. About half way through the month I evaluate what my past year was like. Where I met my goals and where I didn't.

[23:31:17] <leitz> v` then I start my plans for the next year. For me, it takes the time away from expectations and "the norm" to be able to plan clearly and well.

[23:32:20] <leitz> v` I've been doing this for a few years, and it really helps. When I miss doing it, I crash after about 3-4 months into the new year. Then I take the month off expectations, and get back on track.
[23:32:36] <v`> simcop2387: that looks like a very comfy cat
[23:32:49] <v`> leitz: i have a bad track record with making new year's resolutions :(

[23:33:28] <simcop2387> v`: she loved that blanket she's on in those two pics.  i haven't washed it since she passed but it's probably been long enough that i really should but i can't bring myself to do it still.
[23:34:02] <leitz> v` it's not resolutions, but dissolutions. You get rid of everything. Once you've relaxed, you choose one or two things to pick up. It might be something old, or it might be something new.
[23:35:03] <leitz> simcop2387, no reason to wash it. She's still helping you along.
[23:38:21] <v`> simcop2387: idk how to ask this without sounding insensitive, are you open to having another
[23:38:58] <simcop2387> yes, but not in a living situation where i can.  but i've got my niece, nephew, and more importantly my brother's 2 dogs and cats around me at the moment
[23:39:38] <simcop2387> once i'm in my own place again it'll be one of the first things i do once i've settled in.
[23:41:17] <v`> hehe
[23:41:33] <v`> "sure my niece and nephew are great.. but more importantly i have the 2 dogs and cats..."
[23:41:34] <v`> :)
[23:42:16] <simcop2387> my niece doesn't join me in bed and purr while we fall asleep.  it'd also be a lot more weird if she did

[23:43:29] <leitz> simcop2387, yeah, probably best to avoid that.   :)
[23:44:55] <leitz> If I "module-starter --distro Book::Collate", should the distro go into the module names implicitly? Trying to figure out if I missed something.
[23:45:37] <leitz> The modules have  'package Blah;', I thought they would have the distro prepended.
