[11:40:42] <SpaceVimBot_> <Admin> By the way, I have written a multithreaded program, which is computationally intensive. It will open multithreaded parallel computing for tasks of the same type. The CPU has hyper threads, 6 cores and 12 threads. Is there 5, 11 or 9 thread pools? I found that if I open 12 and eat 100% of the CPU, it will cause program exceptions
