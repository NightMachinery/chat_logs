[07:29:07] <foggynight> I'm looking to spin up a personal website. I'm reading into the spiffy and http-client eggs but I have very little experience with webdev so I'm a bit lost. Is it worth using these eggs for a simple static website, maybe with some download links for projects (unsure if I want to host the downloads myself or just redirect to github), or should I just stick with something dead simple like PHP?
[07:29:39] <foggynight> I apologize for the "is it worth it" question, mostly wondering if this would take a lot more work than just going with PHP and calling it a day.
[07:35:34] <florz> for a static website you could just use ... HTML? =:-)
[07:39:42] <foggynight> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I would like to have multiple pages, so I would still need something more than just HTML to navigate between them, no?

[12:05:08] <s-liao> As I checked the source code of function print, which is same to as type character code #\xb6, then press enter.
[12:05:18] <s-liao> in REPL
[12:06:44] <s-liao> But the point is that the code point between 32 and 255 will invoke like ((##sys#slot (##sys#slot ##sys#standard-output 2) 2) ##sys#standard-output #\x59).
[12:07:38] <s-liao> Then ascii code point like #\x59 work
[12:10:33] <s-liao> but for the code point like #\xb6  does not work.
[12:12:15] <s-liao> Even (import uft8)
[12:13:30] <s-liao> After (import utf8), (write-char #\xb6) and (display  #\xb6) works
[12:15:09] <s-liao> Type '#\xb6' in REPL is same to (##sys#slot (##sys#slot ##sys#standard-output 2) 2) ##sys#standard-output  #\xb6)
[12:17:01] <s-liao> How can I step into the function  ##sys#slot to find out what it is going on.

[22:11:48] <mario-goulart> It would be somewhat problematic to deploy it with 5.3.0, as compilation breaks.
[22:24:37] <wasamasa> instead of adding a third argument to the definition of too-many?, the third argument in the calls could be removed
