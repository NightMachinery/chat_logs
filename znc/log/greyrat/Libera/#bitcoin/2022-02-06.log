[04:46:03] <sugardaddy> where is that money too?
[04:47:28] <plankster> sugardaddy stop it
[04:47:39] <plankster> yanmaani were you actually involved with namecoin? i have some questions if so
[04:48:01] <yanmaani> Yes, that money was spent on development. There's specific reports on what everything was spent on.
[04:48:08] <yanmaani> plankster: I am, actually
[04:48:34] <plankster> neato. i had this hairbrained idea for a program that randomly elects people for leadership roles that would use namecoin
[04:48:52] <yanmaani> oh? like sortition?
[04:49:09] <plankster> you give the potential candidates a namecoin thats colored with their identity, insert it into the machine, and it selects public offices randomly
[04:49:44] <plankster> based on this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleroterion
[04:49:47] <sugardaddy> plankster you can use Namecoin IDs like registering them as id/candidate and use the data field to describe that candidate
[04:50:18] <yanmaani> Hm, so in Namecoin parlance: they register a name of their identity, e.g. under the id/ namespace, and then you take a list and select them at random
[04:50:26] <sugardaddy> you are not limited to domains with Namecoin
[04:50:32] <yanmaani> Sure, that would work. The main problem is how do you solve Sybil attacks.
[04:51:04] <plankster> at the scale it would be used for, thats not really an issue
[04:51:15] <yanmaani> Maybe with a Web of Trust, but identity is always tricky. But I guess I don't see the point
[04:51:21] *** Joins: kicoo__ (~kico@user/kico)
[04:51:23] <yanmaani> like, why bother with the domains
[04:51:26] <plankster> finding the motivation to code up something like this is the main obstacle
[04:51:30] <yanmaani> if it's small-scale, then just do, e.g.
[04:51:42] <yanmaani> "here is a list of 256 people, we all agree on the ordering"
[04:51:50] <plankster> also, theres some difficulty finding namecoin block explorers
[04:51:54] <yanmaani> "take block hash of block XXXXXXX, take last 8 bits, presto"
[04:52:09] <plankster> i found one thats free, but it doesnt seem to be maintained any more
[04:52:22] <yanmaani> namebrow.se is the only one I know of, namecha.in is dead; there's some work on porting btc21 though
[04:52:28] <yanmaani> so if that comes through you can run your own
[04:52:47] <yanmaani> I think there's also some that don't have name support
[04:52:56] <plankster> im not the best with nitty gritty technical stuff, the main reason this is still just an idea
[04:53:08] <yanmaani> I think the main problem is, sybil attacks
[04:53:10] <plankster> just wanted to run it by you :)

[04:53:27] <sugardaddy> I would help you including coding up the idea in python
[04:53:28] <yanmaani> and if it's small scale, why do you need namecoin? You only need that if it's dubious to whom "yanmaani" in the list refers
[04:53:41] <plankster> it doesnt _need_ namecoin

[04:53:48] <plankster> but it would make it fun and interesting
[04:54:04] <yanmaani> if it isn't (or e.g. you can agree on yanmaani <key here>), then you can just do it way simpler
[04:54:24] <plankster> maybe thats where it should start. a working prototype that dosnt rely on namecoin
[04:54:34] <yanmaani> It's cool, I suppose. IMO, the one intersting thing you can do with Namecoin for identities, is to skip the key exchange step in e.g. OTR
[04:54:35] <plankster> and then add in cryptocurrency functionality
[04:54:38] <yanmaani> or GPG
[04:54:44] <yanmaani> because the identity is already solid
[04:54:55] <yanmaani> I mean, "sort a list and pick 1 name" is already a solved problem :)
[04:55:13] <plankster> sugardaddy if you give me a working prototype ill pay you a millibit for it
[04:55:19] <sugardaddy> I would recommend involving Bitmessage! reduce the possibility of someone spamming the chain with fake data
[04:56:50] <plankster> im envisioning something like a channel wallet that holds the namecoin for election and distributes it before the election, registering the name of each user while doing so
[04:57:19] <plankster> it would be distributed to each qualified user who has demonstrated capability, either through seniority or whatever
[04:57:45] <plankster> and then each user who wanted to be considered for election would submit their token
[04:57:56] <yanmaani> sort -R --random-source=<(echo BITCOIN_BLOCK_HASH_HERE | sha512sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xxd -r -ps) list.txt
[04:58:00] <yanmaani> there you go, coded and done
[04:59:23] <yanmaani> example use: `sort -R --random-source=<(echo '00000000000000000004e0cf51351bf46ee0a7aaf40311a237151de10390bf25' | sha512sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xxd -r -ps) /etc/dictionaries-common/words | tail -n 1`

[05:00:01] <yanmaani> or whatever other mechanism
[05:00:17] <plankster> well the proposed use case is to elect ops in an irc channel
[05:00:37] <yanmaani> oh, then just do it for the list of people who want to be added

[05:02:04] <plankster> part of the challenge it to replicate the inner workings of the kleroterion itself
[05:02:07] *** Quits: sugardaddy (~sugardadd@138.94.57.60) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:02:12] <yanmaani> everything doesn't have to be cryptocurrency/on a blockchain! the blockchain is good because it allows us to check certain important invariants, but if we use it without good cause it's just a shitty and expensive solution to a simple problem
[05:02:27] <plankster> >The kleroterion was a slab of stone incised with rows of slots and with an attached tube. Citizens' tokens—pinakia—were placed randomly in the slots so that every member of each of the tribes of Athens had their tokens placed in the same column. There was a pipe attached to the stone which could then be fed dice that were coloured differently (assumed to be black and white) and could be released individually by a mechanism that has not survived to
[05:02:27] <plankster>  posterity (but is speculated to be by two nails; one used to block the open end and another to separate the next die to fall from the rest of the dice above it.
[05:02:28] <yanmaani> seems like you could pretty exactly replicate it?
[05:02:44] <plankster> but to replicate it youd need to do all these things to a token
[05:02:59] <yanmaani> from what I understand, the RNG source is dice?
[05:03:07] <yanmaani> so you just have like an Excel spreadsheet
[05:03:25] <yanmaani> and you have a mutually agreed upon algorithm on how to use the RNG source to select the citizens
[05:03:25] <plankster> >When a die was released, a complete row of tokens (so, one citizen from each of the tribes of Athens) was either selected if the die was coloured one colour, or discarded if it was the alternate colour. This process continued until the requisite number of citizens was selected.
[05:03:50] <plankster> theres also some stuff about how the inputs are arranged
[05:04:02] <yanmaani> the 'dice' are two-sided?
[05:04:08] <yanmaani> or like six sides, but three/three
[05:04:10] <yanmaani> so like a coin flip
[05:04:10] <plankster> im not sure
[05:04:59] <yanmaani> oh it says here
[05:05:02] <yanmaani> dice are all black or all white
[05:05:20] <yanmaani> "Once the token inserter filled the kleroterion, the archon then placed a mix of black and white dice (kyboi) into the side of the kleroterion. The number of white dice was proportional to the number of jurors needed."
[05:05:55] <plankster> youre doing a good job of convincing me this is way simpler than i thought it was :P
[05:06:13] <yanmaani> I'm guessing, if there's 3000 citizens, and you need 30 judges, and each row is 5 people, you get 30/5 white dice and 2970/5 black?
[05:06:44] <yanmaani> So then you just have to replicate it. I think the only thing unique with this machine is that it picked people equally from all the tribes.
[05:06:46] <plankster> it says a complete row is selected at the same time
[05:06:53] <yanmaani> yeah, so it gets an equal quota
[05:07:12] <plankster> hmmm, what would the equivalent of athenian tribes be on irc
[05:07:19] <plankster> continent of origin?
[05:07:54] <yanmaani> depends on what you want equality in respect of
[05:08:03] <yanmaani> I would guess "moderation philosophy" or something
[05:08:05] <plankster> right, its a topic for deliberation
[05:08:12] <yanmaani> but in the end, it all comes down to "what problem are you trying to solve"
[05:08:31] <plankster> its more of a social experiment than it is a solution
[05:08:53] <yanmaani> (or are you just cargo-culting Ancient Greece/Athens?)
[05:08:58] <plankster> lol maybe

[16:01:51] <buZz> or how it works even
[16:04:05] <caveman> s17: you mean the merkle tree is not in the blockchain?
[16:04:17] <buZz> where people are from
[16:04:21] <buZz> or even identity
[16:04:28] <buZz> or products purchased
[16:04:38] <buZz> or if a address is a vendor
[16:05:13] <buZz> some of these i even already told you about weeks ago
[16:05:35] <buZz> plus gave you sources to find that knowledge for yourself, which you clearly are still avoiding
[16:11:06] <caveman> can you repeat?
[16:11:23] <caveman> hints?  because i doubt you did.  i think you're confusing my new question with some older ones.
[16:16:23] <buZz> you doubt a lot of stuff but dont invest any time to educate yourself , you're just a supporthog
[16:17:02] <buZz> not even -actual cavemen- were such a drain on communities :P
