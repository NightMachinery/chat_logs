[05:38:43] <seicho> I have an issue that's eluding me. I just built the latest emacs from HEAD and I'm getting the following error which has me stumped when I open a new instance of emacs GUI on linux: error("Cannot find suitable directory for output in `native-comp-eln-load-path'")
[05:39:32] <seicho> I see a few old bug reports related to this issue and the eln-cache directory not existing, but this does not appear to be the cause for my instance of the error (the directory exists and has a directory containing at least two .eln files).
[05:39:55] <seicho> Has anyone, by chance, experienced this issue in the last couple of days?
[05:41:58] <seicho> fwiw, when I inspect `native-comp-eln-load-path`, I don't actually see the `eln-cache` directory present. I see the following ("/usr/lib/emacs/29.0.50/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/../../../../bin/../lib/emacs/29.0.50/native-lisp/")

[14:41:38] <fnstudio_> got it, this was very helpful, thanks artefact wasamasa
[14:41:39] <wasamasa> it offers zero protection from malicious code running in your emacs session
[14:41:47] <wasamasa> it can just call the function
[14:41:57] <fnstudio_> wasamasa: yeah, that's what i thought
[14:42:12] <wasamasa> it just protects anyone briefly looking at the data from seeing it
[14:42:31] <wasamasa> like in the case of creating a pastebin of a backtrace containing the secrets stuff

[16:26:56] <Unicorn_Princess> what should i be using to search for files, either arbitrary, or within a project? i'm on spacemacs, so I already have projectile, helm, and treemacs, but couldn't find anything on how to search for a file recursively. except projectile-find-file-in-known-projects, which is very nice and all, but is there a version to only search in the /current/ project? since most of the time, other projects are just noise to what i'm doing.

[19:54:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hmm... okay not quite as convenient as I thought, it refuses to remove the last one.
[19:54:04] <TRS-80> but specifically there are a lot of hooks in kill-emacs-hook, I wonder if those get called from delete-frame?
[19:55:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TRS-80: I know it works when you start it with --daemon
[19:55:11] <TRS-80> Yeah docstring seems to indicate it only runs delete-frame-functions which only contain one thing.
