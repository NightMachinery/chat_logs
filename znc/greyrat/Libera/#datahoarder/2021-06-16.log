[06:14:55] <sarnold> nice, here's hoping it works out well
[06:16:29] <evilgohan2> joepie91: I have no idea, and I wasn't presented one so I didn't even know it had one. What kills me are sites like archive.is having captcha's - the latter in particular using hCAPTCHA (which is extremely unfriendly to accessibility services, particularly in private browsing modes).
[06:16:48] <joepie91> evilgohan2: cloudflare captcha is also hcaptcha
[06:16:53] <evilgohan2> Oh dear...

[12:02:23] <Snuupy> give it a try
[12:02:28] <Snuupy> they have a docker image
[12:03:01] <Snuupy> if you aren't happy with it, there's a list of alternatives: https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#other-archivebox-alternatives
[12:03:43] <kz> Oh I have it running - Just trying to see how - when adding a snapshot/URL to pull _ALL_ videos from a channel.  There is an option of grabbing all sites 1 hop away -  but that would grab a lot of unnecessary stuff imo

[12:04:55] <Snuupy> I wonder if youtube-dl has an option for grabbing an entire channel
[12:05:22] <ThePendulum> iirc it does but it's broken a lot
[12:05:34] <Snuupy> this doesn't work https://demo.archivebox.io/archive/1587338075.0/index.html for example
[12:05:37] <Snuupy> so it might not do what you want hmm
[12:06:34] <kz> It does - standalone wise.  I've already done like 20 individual videos I want preserved. 
[12:07:08] <Snuupy> interesting

[17:53:51] <Caterpillar> Hello, I have some questions about rsync as backup tool for some folders: 1) can rsync take incremental snapshots that I can label by date? 2) if yes, is it possible to "mount" somewhere snapshot of day X as I do with ZFS snapshots?
[17:58:55] *** Quits: pete443 (~pete443@user/pete443) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:03:17] <brimstone> rsync can use one directory as it's base for what's missing in a third directory. you can fake the snapshot feature that way
[18:04:13] <brimstone> i think that's the `--compare-dest` option

[18:05:38] <Caterpillar> brimstone: ok, so you imagine what I need. So I assume your reply is "no you cannot do that with rsync"

[18:06:02] *** Joins: pete443 (~pete@user/pete443)
[18:06:11] <brimstone> rsync is basically a file copy tool, not a backup management tool
[18:06:31] <brimstone> or snapshot management tool
[18:06:35] <Caterpillar> brimstone: I was trying to search a tool that can work on top of rsync to achieve that
[18:07:04] <brimstone> surely there's a backup tool that can use rsync
[18:07:11] <brimstone> restic might
[18:07:20] <brimstone> restic can use rclone, but rclone is not rsync
[18:09:39] <Caterpillar> brimstone ok since rsync seems to not fit well my needs, : do you know other tools that can do that?  I am operating at object storage level so I cannot use zfs / btrfs snapshots

[21:12:45] <unfinity> x10 you befriended a duck in 27.495 seconds! You have made friends with 136 ducks in #datahoarder.
[21:16:21] <NeoThermic> also with them nuking old services
[21:16:33] <NeoThermic> that's also the last time lilo's nick goes
[21:26:16] <ThePendulum> NeoThermic: are you looking to get that lego typewriter?

[22:25:17] <ThePendulum> NeoThermic: what happens after 2 years?
[22:25:27] <ThePendulum> it goes out of production?
[22:25:49] <ThePendulum> I do need to put up another shelf, but it would be above my monitor, and I want to buy a new monitor later this year, and I'm not sure how big it's going to be...
[22:33:11] <NeoThermic> ThePendulum, roughly, yes
[22:33:29] <NeoThermic> it's the constant for most sets, they're sold for about 2 years, give or take
[22:34:42] <NeoThermic> there's a bunch of exceptions either side of that (and the longest standing set was 9 years..!), but it's a good metric when looking to get any lego set; you have about 2 years from first day of sales to retirement
