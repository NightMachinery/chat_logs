[00:01:09] <gb73d> M Heidegger Being and Time: when you think about any thing, realise how your attitude to "it" is framed. Do you see it as a strength a weakness or a threat ?
[00:01:30] <gb73d> or an opportunity
[00:01:39] <gb73d> its very easy to overlook that
[00:02:39] <Delf> Did I overlook it?
[00:03:29] <gb73d> if so you may see its as a threat or a lost opportunity.
[00:04:12] <causative_> philosophy of the mind must be informed by neuroscience and artificial intelligence. When you say someone's "attitude" about something, it must be understood that an "attitude" is a certain pattern of mental activity, corresponding to brain activity. Otherwise we are not speaking of anything concrete.
[00:04:49] <gb73d> here we go reductionism knee jerk reaction.
[00:05:15] <causative_> to fail to reduce things to their basic components is to fail to understand them deeply
[00:05:29] <causative_> something reducible that is not reduced, is only an appearance, an empty shell
[00:05:29] <gb73d> ur attitude may be medeieval
[00:05:38] <causative_> no, this is a 20th century attitude
[00:05:52] <gb73d> theres more to everything
[00:06:54] <causative_> in medieval times they didn't have the modern understanding of physics
[00:07:00] <causative_> so they could not have had this perspective
[00:07:38] <causative_> they didn't have the modern understanding of neuroscience either, in fact for a long time the brain was thought of as an organ to cool the blood
[00:07:54] <gb73d> trying to find the final solution it was God in history now its someones latest tech
[00:08:05] <gb73d> its the same
[00:08:14] <causative_> "two things claim to be a solution, therefore they are the same!"
[00:08:36] <gb73d> solutions yep

[21:06:30] <pussipupu> hey arryana, random question as you know dogs better than me: do you think they can reasonably learn from video?
[21:06:55] <arryana> they can, but only after they have a reasonable grasp of language
[21:07:55] <arryana> if i had any advice regarding raising an intelligent, well adjusted dog, it'd be to spend the first year explaining everything to them as if they were toddlers.
[21:07:57] <pussipupu> I know they learn well from other dogs modelling behaviour, and the cats certainly think there are delicious birds in the telly...
[21:08:12] <pussipupu> Because they are toddlers? :p
[21:08:20] <arryana> 'this is a spoon.  a spoon is metal.  can you show me something else that's metal?'
[21:08:54] <arryana> i think the biggest thing to tell from the start is if they're active or passive learners
[21:09:20] <arryana> my older one is an active learner.  eyes bright, ears up, head tilted whenever you explain something or show her something new
[21:09:38] <arryana> my younger appears to be totally disinterested, but then she'll bust out what she learned unexpectedly.
[21:09:43] <pussipupu> in my experience collies almost always are active learners
[21:09:55] * arryana nods
[21:10:01] <arryana> agreed
[21:10:14] <pussipupu> one of the reasons we chose the breed
[21:10:18] <arryana> it's very easy to mistake a passive learner as not paying attention
[21:10:29] <pussipupu> also intelligence and loveliness
[21:10:43] <arryana> they're in my top three favorites.
[21:11:00] <pussipupu> I'm more passive, I like to stand quietly and pay close attention before doing things

[21:14:11] <pussipupu> yeah, I think it's threat training evolutionarily
[21:14:28] <pussipupu> but if you're not careful you get misfires and phobias
[21:15:42] * arryana nods
[21:16:01] <arryana> they hit a few ages and sort of go haywire, so it's better to keep them calm but gently exposed to things for those
[21:16:33] <arryana> i tend to be sort of paranoid the first year and a half or so, if you can get them through that far without any serious traumatic events, they usually grow up bulletproof
[21:17:19] <arryana> i'd also say, make a list of all sorts of things to expose them to.  long skirts, hats, helmets, goggles, canes, umbrellas, uniforms
[21:17:38] <arryana> boots can be a big one for some puppies
[21:17:58] <pussipupu> Molotov cocktails, in case Russia invades
[21:18:20] <arryana> when the girls were ten weeks old or so, i'd take them to the local grocery store and sit with them on the bench out front, so they got used to the passing trolleys
[21:18:28] <arryana> haha
[21:19:36] <arryana> letting them be handled by gentle children is another thing

[21:20:18] <pussipupu> convincing him not to herd the cats is a bit of a worry for me
[21:20:23] <arryana> we use the command 'gentle with the kitty' for any small animal
[21:21:08] <arryana> their own cat will throw herselves at their heads and chew on their faces in play, which helps a lot
[21:21:40] <arryana> since she doesn't hurt them, they sit stoically under pretty much any invasion like that

[21:42:12] <pussipupu> I don't think so, no
[21:42:27] * arryana nods
[21:43:09] <pussipupu> Well, not as I interpret the phrase, he will have a box and learn that he sometimes has to be in it (and always can be)
[21:43:27] * arryana nods
[21:47:37] <arryana> i crate train, but that's personal preference.  it's easy to not-crate-them later, but much harder to teach them to be comfortable with it when they're older.
[21:48:29] <arryana> at this age, the crates are stored in the garage, and they only come out for odd circumstance.  when they were younger, however, i found them invaluable.
[21:49:09] <arryana> i find that if puppies never get a chance to be destructive before they're 2 or so, they never have the impulse.

[22:43:24] <pussipupu> yes, no, and "you are running into danger" respectively
[22:43:27] <arryana> my brothers and i learned it when we were little, there was an instruction set on a bunch of walkie talkies we had
[22:43:32] <arryana> but i dont' remember a thing
[22:44:00] <pussipupu> I learnt it back when I sailed, but sadly I've not been able lately

[22:45:14] <blkshp> xD
[22:45:33] <blkshp> I downloaded an app MorseMania and learned with that
[22:45:33] <pussipupu> at sea the phrase/word meanings are more important than the letters themselves
[22:45:39] <blkshp> It's quite intuitive
[22:45:46] <blkshp> I can imagine
[22:45:59] <pussipupu> the letters are mostly useful as a bridge to signal flags and such

[22:47:04] <blkshp> I only learned it to translate a recording that a friends son and I made at a war museum. He learned it effectively in a week or so, i took 2 which isnt bad as he's 15 and I'm ... well older! lol
[22:47:32] <pussipupu> I need better locks, the cheap ones I've picked up aren't much of a challenge
[22:48:00] <pussipupu> fifteen and a quarter
[22:48:26] <blkshp> From some of the videos i've seen on yt, it doesn't matter the lock, someone will be able to get it. (15 and 88 quarters)
[22:48:38] <blkshp> God that's horrible to see lol
[22:49:56] <pussipupu> Almost any lock is pickable,  except some modern ones which are computers
[22:50:13] <pussipupu> but more security features means more fun
[22:50:18] <blkshp> Which are still pickable with the correct technical skills

[23:25:31] <juliaEnv> have you noticed that coronavirus charlatans have dictated nonsense until they've caused a great depression and a war?
[23:26:15] <juliaEnv> covid19 charlatans don't have enough. They want to dictate nonsense further and increase the crisis and conflicts.

[23:26:29] *** blkshp sets mode: -o blkshp
[23:28:25] <blkshp> That was actually accidental and I have mentioned this to the user.

[23:42:29] <pussipupu> What a shame they haven't come back to make whatever the fuck that claim was again
[23:42:34] <pussipupu> Such a shame
[23:44:13] <blkshp> I think it was a little ambiguous and i would have enjoyed clarifying which side they were on but nope
[23:44:18] <blkshp> They did speak to me though
[23:44:57] <pussipupu> I strongly suspect clarity would not have been forthcoming
[23:47:09] <blkshp> I don't disagree
