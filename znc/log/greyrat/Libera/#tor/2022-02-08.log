[04:25:31] <carnophage2> hi.
[04:26:41] <carnophage2> I am having some trouble setting up a hidden service and am not finding any information that helps.  I thought I might come here to see if anyone is interested in maybe lending me a hand?  It's probably just something simple I'm missing.
[04:44:54] <xx> did you read the page on the torproject website?
[04:45:11] <carnophage2> yeah, I'm getting weird errors
[04:45:16] <carnophage2> i have the torrc edited
[04:45:25] <xx> what are the errors then?
[04:45:33] <carnophage2> Feb 08 01:11:19.190 [warn] Permissions on directory /hyacinth/ are too permissive.
[04:45:33] <carnophage2> Feb 08 01:11:19.191 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Failed to configure rendezvous options. See logs for details.
[04:45:33] <carnophage2> Feb 08 01:11:19.192 [err] Reading config failed--see warnings above.
[04:46:59] <xx> first one is a warning, but you should still fix it
[04:47:13] <xx> 2nd one probably means somethings bugged with your torrc file
[04:47:40] <xx> https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/
[04:47:45] <xx> try that very simple setup first
[04:47:56] <xx> and if it works, then you can start doing the actual thing you want
[04:49:13] <carnophage2> followed it, no joy
[04:49:17] <carnophage2> error is as follows again
[04:49:19] <carnophage2> pi@raspberrypi:/ $ tor

[04:51:35] <xx> let's at least fix the first warning, and see what happens
[04:51:42] <xx> what are the permissions on /hyacinth/ ?
[04:51:52] <carnophage2> i think it was the ownership
[04:51:59] <carnophage2> seems to work, but may need to change the dir
