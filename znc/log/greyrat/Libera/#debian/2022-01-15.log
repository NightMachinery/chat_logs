[00:10:27] <johnjaye> what's a good palce to start to find out why a package is not installable?
[00:10:43] <johnjaye> i tried apt and apt-get and both said the dependencies of the package are not installable
[00:12:50] <sney> both showed you dependencies that were not installable, so then you try to install those dependencies, and apt may give you more clues
[00:13:10] <sney> or you can do e.g. 'apt policy dependencynamehere' and see if it's available at the correct version

[00:16:33] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>

[00:20:11] <sney> bookworm is the current testing, if you tried to upgrade straight from buster to bookworm then that probably did break. but look at /etc/debian_version to be sure of where you are
[00:20:42] <johnjaye> it says bookworm/sid
[00:20:53] <johnjaye> what does the / mean?

[00:22:23] <randall> johnjaye: If you upgraded from buster to bookworm, you skipped a release. I'd reinstall fresh, because that breaks a ton of stuff and isn't supported.
[00:23:11] <johnjaye> ok
[00:23:29] <johnjaye> i'm not sure in any case since it's been awhile
[00:23:36] <johnjaye> but i can install the packages in a fresh debian VM
[00:23:40] <johnjaye> so i assume something is broken
[00:25:35] <johnjaye> according to the wiki the safest way to upgrade is to change sources.list, and then run 'sudo apt clean; sudo apt update; sudo apt full-upgrade'.
[00:25:54] <sney> right, but you can only upgrade 1 release at a time
[00:26:00] <greycat> Change sources.list to the right thing.  You left out "to the right thing".
[00:26:12] <greycat> You can't just change sources.list to ANYTHING.
[00:26:15] <sney> so going from buster (10) you would have to upgrade to bullseye (11) *first* before trying to upgrade to testing/unstable
[00:26:30] <johnjaye> well. you could change sources from bullseye to 'testing'. but that might cause problems during the next release
[00:26:43] <johnjaye> heh
[00:26:53] <greycat> bullseye (current stable) to testing is one of the approved paths

[03:45:56] <sney> if a package is suggested by another package, it won't be automatically removed. you can do stuff like 'apt remove ~nfoo' to remove all packages with foo in the name
[03:46:29] <sney> this has always been an "issue" of sorts, except it's less destructive to leave a package or two installed, than it would be to accidentally remove something you're using due to a weak dependency relationship.

[20:10:37] <roosterphant> does vagrant or docker use less space per VM?
[20:10:51] <roosterphant> it seems im looking at 15+ GB per VM
[20:13:16] *** Quits: tzf (~tzf@user/tzf) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:13:49] <Cool_Fire> docker generally uses less space per vm, but that's because it's not a full vm but a container
[20:14:20] <Cool_Fire> The same applies to LXC containers too

[20:16:12] <Cool_Fire> vagrant is a frontend, so it depends on the backend you use for it. It can use virtualbox and docker (and a few others I think) but it does not do anything special that makes the VM/containers smaller than using a non-vagrant managed machine on the same backend
[20:18:15] <Cool_Fire> If you're not doing anything weird/dangerous/messing with the kernel, an lxc or docker container is usually a fine option
[20:18:48] <roosterphant> i want to run jdownloader
[20:19:10] <roosterphant> so i dont need very high security, id just prefer it cant read the main filesystem
[20:20:02] <Cool_Fire> So long as you're not bind mounting the host filesystem or your docker socket inside the container, it's probably mostly fine.
[20:21:46] <Cool_Fire> But if you want to use the jdownloader gui with it, that might be a bit of a hassle
[20:22:01] <roosterphant> why
[20:22:21] <Cool_Fire> containers are usually geared towards running headless

[23:20:04] <judd> Package: obs-studio on amd64 -- stretch: 0.15.4+dfsg1-1+b1; buster: 22.0.3+dfsg1-1; bullseye: 26.1.2+dfsg1-2; bookworm: 27.1.3+dfsg1-2; sid: 27.1.3+dfsg1-2; stretch-multimedia: 1:19.0.2-dmo2+deb9u1; buster-multimedia: 1:23.2.1-dmo1+deb10u1; bullseye-multimedia: 1:27.0.1-dmo2; sid-multimedia: 1:27.1.3-dmo1
[23:20:27] <zumba_addict> i'm in buster
[23:20:55] <jmcnaught> zumba_addict: so you do have obs-studio installed from Debian, but that does not mean you have not *also* installed it from elsewhere (like a PPA, which are for Ubuntu only and not Debian)
[23:21:08] <zumba_addict> got it
[23:21:16] <zumba_addict> it's ok for me to uninstall it
[23:21:31] <zumba_addict> how do i remove a ppa
[23:22:20] *** Parts: tieinv (~tieinv@user/tieinv) (Leaving)
[23:22:20] <jmcnaught> zumba_addict: you can just remove it from /etc/apt/sources.list (or file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/) but that will not remove the packages installed from it which can be more tricky.
[23:22:47] <zumba_addict> i'll uninstall it then remove it from sources.list
[23:23:06] <sney> if you tried to use apt-add-repository on debian then it's likely nothing happened
[23:23:15] <sney> you got "command not found" and then installed obs from main
[23:23:28] <zumba_addict> so most likely the obs-studio I have is the correct one?
[23:23:40] <sney> well, it's clearly a debian package
[23:23:47] <zumba_addict> ok
[23:23:48] <jmcnaught> zumba_addict: well I do not see a reason to remove the Debian package obs-studio unless you intend to use a different one.
[23:24:02] <sney> it's a little older so it might not support current obs features
[23:24:07] <jmcnaught> I just said it's possible you also installed another copy from elsewhere, that only you would know about.
[23:24:29] <zumba_addict> i'm just hoping to see hw encoder from the list
[23:24:33] <jmcnaught> zumba_addict: why not upgrade to Debian 11?  It has newer obs-studio and newer libraries.
[23:24:35] <zumba_addict> let me uninstall it
[23:24:42] <zumba_addict> oh, cool
[23:24:56] <zumba_addict> I can do that. I really like my compiz. Will it affect it?
[23:25:13] <zumba_addict> What about my Davinci Resolve, will it affect it?
[23:25:24] <zumba_addict> though I can reinstall them
[23:25:43] <jmcnaught> I doubt compiz would be affected by an upgrade, third-party software not from Debian could be another story.
[23:26:04] <UrielCorinthian> zumba_addict, you've actually managed to get DaVinci Resolve to run on Debian?
[23:26:13] <zumba_addict> yes, why?
[23:26:21] <jmcnaught> zumba_addict: if you do decide to upgrade to Debian 11 make sure to read the release notes and follow the upgrade instructions from there: https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/releasenotes
[23:26:29] <zumba_addict> will do
[23:26:40] <zumba_addict> I do remember I had a hard time debugging davinci to get it working
[23:26:46] <UrielCorinthian> zumba_addict, I struggled for days, and gave up when I went to their page and they said officially they only support CentOS :')
[23:26:55] <zumba_addict> oh
[23:27:06] <zumba_addict> i have to save my history to see all the things I did
[23:27:08] <zumba_addict> it's been months
[23:27:13] <zumba_addict> unix history
[23:27:19] <zumba_addict> it was tough
[23:28:09] <UrielCorinthian> But knowing that someone else managed gives me hope... Don't mean to derail your discussion here, but just curious what graphics card you have in the machine you're running DaVinci on. I suspect my legacy card might really have been the root of the problem for me
[23:28:12] <zumba_addict> yes, I am tempted to iupgrade to 11 but before I do that, now I have to take down notes and figure out how I got davinci working. Glad you brought it up, I forgot it, hahaha

[23:28:21] <jmcnaught> Taking notes instead of relying on commands to still be in .bash_history is a lesson I keep on learning.
[23:28:29] <zumba_addict> I am using Radeon RX 460
[23:28:56] <UrielCorinthian> zumba_addict, thanks. I have a legacy nVidia. I'll give it a shot again sometime ;)
[23:29:05] <zumba_addict> cool
[23:29:20] <UrielCorinthian> Bedtime for me. Later!
[23:29:22] <zumba_addict> i noticed though it cannot import mp4, so I always have to convert it first to mov
[23:29:37] <zumba_addict> also m4a to mp3 first
[23:30:06] <zumba_addict> but for m4a with mp4, I just use ffmpeg
[23:30:18] <zumba_addict> i always noticed davinci ruins audio
[23:30:22] <zumba_addict> even on mac laptop
[23:30:35] <zumba_addict> have a great night UrielCorinthian
[23:30:53] <zumba_addict> yes, I will take down notes jmcnaught
[23:33:16] <jmcnaught> I just tried obs-studio on Debian 11 (I also have an AMD RX 460) and the encoder options are x264 and FFMPEG VAAPI

[23:35:46] <zumba_addict> yes, that's the one I am looking for
[23:35:49] <zumba_addict> ffmpeg vaapi
[23:36:01] <zumba_addict> that's what ffmpeg devs told me
[23:36:11] <zumba_addict> i don't see that right now in my obs-studio in buster
[23:36:32] <zumba_addict> how old is buster?
[23:36:43] <sney> released 2019
[23:36:47] <zumba_addict> ok
[23:36:52] <zumba_addict> I will upgrade :)
[23:37:14] <zumba_addict> i've got 90Gb+ free space so it should be good

[23:38:47] <zumba_addict> I still need to eventually upgrade my 12 year old cpu since it's underpowered to capture my 4k screen
[23:39:17] <sney> that's some legacy hardware ;)
[23:39:22] <zumba_addict> yep, hehe
[23:39:29] <zumba_addict> plays back 4k videos fine
[23:39:48] <sney> that 2010s era stuff is still useful for a lot of things, I'm typing this on a 2014 laptop, but it does show when you try to do something big
[23:39:49] <zumba_addict> but not recording my screen. It works but I see some performance degradation
[23:39:59] <zumba_addict> yes
[23:40:14] <zumba_addict> i'd like to buy a better cpu, mobo and memory
[23:40:20] <zumba_addict> maybe disk to like ssd
[23:40:39] <zumba_addict> maybe just build a separate machine and keep this one running
