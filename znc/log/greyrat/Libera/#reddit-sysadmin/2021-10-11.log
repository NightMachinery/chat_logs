[08:42:09] <csws> @ryalln yes
[08:42:23] <csws> I had to hide under a shelter for like 20 mins
[08:42:26] <csws> and still got rained on a bit
[08:42:31] <csws> it rained like crazy
[08:42:59] <csws> lol isn't mitchy in NSW
[08:43:32] <xe0n> its supposed to rain here either tomorrow or wed
[08:43:37] <xe0n> nice and warm atm
[08:43:41] <xe0n> in shorts and singlet lol
[08:44:01] <csws> oh well last rain for the week hopefully
[08:44:04] <csws> going up to 30 by end of week
[08:44:07] <xe0n> niiice
[08:44:07] <csws> but then back down again probably
[08:44:15] <csws> 30 is too high
[08:44:15] <A-KO> mornin' xe0n? or afternoon?
[08:44:16] <A-KO> lol
[08:44:23] <csws> but sat's forecast of 27 seems pretty acceptable
[08:44:26] <csws> I'd prefer ~23
[08:44:28] <csws> fewer flies
[08:45:06] <xe0n> afternoon :D
[08:45:25] <csws> DST yet for nsw/vic/tas/act?
[08:45:27] <csws> oh and sa
[08:45:29] <csws> can't forget them
[08:46:17] <xe0n> yeah it is
[08:50:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:50:08] <Hunterkll> DST is such a scam

[08:54:04] <csws> lol late
[08:54:21] <csws> it's a scam but...
[08:54:27] <csws> they're 1 hour closer to 5pm than me :(
[08:55:37] <xe0n> is it 5pm yet?
[08:56:38] <A-KO> I actually prefer being in DST time
[08:56:44] <A-KO> I don't know why people don't like having light until later
[08:56:56] <A-KO> I like getting off of work and having actual fuckin' daylight to do shit
[08:57:13] <A-KO> like if we perma-shifted to DST I'd be fine
[08:57:19] <csws> imo if you want to "do things" after work then knock off earlier
[08:57:20] <csws> that's my advice
[08:57:27] <A-KO> yeah that's not how it works here in the US :P
[08:57:29] <csws> don't drag me and all the other shut ins along with you
[08:57:38] <xe0n> DST is great
[08:57:54] <xe0n> as if you dont like finishing work and having a few hours of daylight left to do things
[08:57:58] <xe0n> not...rush home to sit in front of your own pc
[08:58:23] <A-KO> I am a total shut in, but I do like having daylight hours to do shit
[08:58:29] <A-KO> even just to walk around
[08:58:40] <A-KO> literally you can't be much more of a shut in than I have been these past 2 years
[08:58:47] <A-KO> I barely even commute to work at this point
[08:59:09] <A-KO> I instacart grocery stores, and I visit and hang out with *one* friend regularly. And most of that is spent hanging out and playing video games or watching movies lol
[08:59:22] <A-KO> I also take Vitamin D pills
[08:59:22] <A-KO> so
[08:59:24] <A-KO> there's that LOL
[08:59:30] <xe0n> yeah get some real sun...
[08:59:34] <A-KO> (I actually have low vitamin d, I'm not some stupid ass antivaxxer)
[09:00:14] <A-KO> I take a Vitamin D pill (50,000U) every week lol
[09:00:18] <A-KO> my vitamin d was low low
[09:00:19] <A-KO> like super low
[09:00:24] <xe0n> sure, still good to get some real sun
[09:00:29] <A-KO> haha
[09:00:38] <xe0n> i copped it on weekend, burnt my scalp LOL
[09:00:41] <xe0n> forgot shaved head = no protection
[09:00:42] <xe0n> LOL
[09:00:44] <A-KO> at any rate, long story short ; I prefer DST time
[09:00:45] <xe0n> forgot my cap :P
[09:00:51] <csws> baldie mcgee
[09:00:56] <xe0n> well im not bald
[09:00:58] <xe0n> shaved
[09:01:00] <xe0n> 0.5 - 1.5
[09:01:03] <csws> sure
[09:01:05] <xe0n> oO
[09:01:11] <Hunterkll> A-KO: yea yea 
[09:01:14] <Hunterkll> <A-KO> I actually prefer being in DST time
[09:01:16] <Hunterkll> i meant
[09:01:16] <csws> probably shave for the same reason my dad does
[09:01:19] <Hunterkll> the whole time switch thing
[09:01:24] <csws> it's more horrifying with the ring of hair around the bald spot
[09:01:26] <xe0n> i shave because i got thick hair, humid and hot af in qld
[09:01:27] <xe0n> lol
[09:01:27] <Hunterkll> DST costs money, wastes energy, etc
[09:01:29] <Hunterkll> lopl
[09:01:31] <A-KO> Even aside from the whole train origins of DST, there's still very real reasons to have DST as it relates to the earth's orbit around the sun. We could probably do it better...
[09:01:37] <xe0n> i have no problem growing my hair, i get a haircut every few weeks for that reason lol!
[09:01:45] <A-KO> if we were in perma DST, than I'd be fine
[09:01:47] <Hunterkll> A-KO: or just do away with it entirely
[09:01:49] <A-KO> but I understand why we do it
[09:01:51] <Hunterkll> which studies show is the best option
[09:02:03] <Hunterkll> yea because of some fucking jackass in the late 1700s 
[09:02:06] <csws> I mean if you want to knock off earlier then address the root of the problem imo
[09:02:08] <csws> more flexible working
[09:02:09] <A-KO> I don't want to get out of work in July and it be dark at 6:30-7:00PM because of idiots
[09:02:21] <bloody> "Daylight-saving time is literally killing us — it's time to end this switch. That morning, most phones and computers will automatically tick forward one hour, and we'll lose an hour of sleep. Incidents of heart attacks, strokes, and fatal car crashes all spike around the start of DST"
[09:02:24] <xe0n> why leave then, get out at 5
[09:02:43] <xe0n> hahah
[09:02:50] <bloody> interesting little tidbit about DST
[09:02:51] <bloody> lol
[09:03:10] <A-KO> sure. Again, if we stayed in perma DST I'd be fine. But for most people that would mean getting up long after it's light out
[09:03:15] <A-KO> during winter
[09:03:40] <A-KO> winter would absolutely suck and be offset
[09:03:58] <A-KO> and honestly that could make winter without DST much more dangerous than the DST switches
[09:04:04] <A-KO> but we've not done that so O.o
[09:04:33] <A-KO> there are places without DST, of course. But in the US that's dwindling. And most of North America does it to some degree.
[09:04:55] <A-KO> you either flip sleep/work schedules or you just shift the time, realistically
[09:05:01] <A-KO> more daylight in the morning means you need to do things before work
[09:11:47] <bloody> id be for that too

[16:21:13] <estranger> you can adjust deductions with a simple form but many don't
[16:22:54] <csws> 420 ms over my ipsec tunnel
[16:22:58] <estranger> issue I hit was when I changed jobs the new job didn't know how much I contributed to social security and over contributed ... ended with a huge refund which I see as a bad thing
[16:23:10] <estranger> csws fire it up dawg
[16:23:28] <csws> tfw it was 220 the other day
[16:24:13] <dunz0r> estranger: Yeah, same here too. If I was to work full time and then have a second half time job, I would probably have to tell them both to pay extra taxes, or something.
[16:24:31] <dunz0r> We just have two tiers though
[16:25:00] <estranger> we have like... I dunno 10+ tiers and varies if married or not
[16:25:35] <dunz0r> o_O
[16:26:09] <estranger> ok it's 7 brackets, from 10 to 37 percent
[16:26:13] <dunz0r> Two tiers. Less than magic number, and more than magic number. Everything above <magic number> gets taxed an extra 20%
[16:27:03] <dunz0r> Hey, anyone ever done "timetracking" from RTs open/close-times? 
[16:27:18] <estranger> what's the magic number?

[16:29:11] <dunz0r> estranger: Right now it's a bit more than 50k EUR.
[16:29:25] <estranger> so it's a low magic number then
[16:30:08] <dunz0r> >50k EUR per year is like top 10%

[16:48:47] <sintax> so i went and looked at the ford maverick. the dealer wanted to charge an additional $3500 for "supply and demand". I said no and walked out. 
[16:49:06] <estranger> yeh, car market is screwy 
[16:49:10] <sintax> yup
[16:49:32] <estranger> demand is way higher than supply... no more incentives either it seems
[16:49:59] <sintax> estranger: i ended up using carvana. they gave me another $1000 for my car on trade in over teh dealers and i found a 2016 gmc canyon with a 6foot bed, tow package 4x4. $31k. It delivers thursday
[16:50:11] <catbeard> buy a car from us, and you'll have a car!
[16:50:22] <sintax> estranger: yeah the whole car market is nuts. i got lucky and found that for a decent price. 
[16:50:23] <catbeard> "uhh yeah.. thanks"
[16:50:25] <estranger> how did carvana go? never tried them
[16:50:46] <sintax> estranger: if i can help it i'll never buy another car any other way. i did it all on my phone on their website. so easy
[16:50:56] <sintax> didn't have to talk to a sales person at all. which was nice. 
[16:51:09] <sintax> no upsells, i mean they ask but i declined. i'd do it again
[16:51:11] <estranger> nice. I've used CarMax before cus it's so easy
[16:51:16] <vinrock> i uh
[16:51:20] <vinrock> personally wouldnt recommend carvana
[16:51:24] <vinrock> carmax tho has an excelent warranty
[16:51:32] <sintax> yeah i don't get a warranty. 
[16:51:35] <vinrock> carvana has a pretty notirious record of fucking people over
[16:51:36] <sintax> i've used carmax before. 
[16:51:42] <estranger> yeah, you pay a bit more but is covered and no hassles
[16:51:48] <sintax> vinrock: i had a friend use them that didn't have any issues.
[16:51:55] <catbeard> isn't.. that what insurance is for?
[16:52:05] <vinrock> estranger theres a guy that found an amg s65 (v12!!) at carmax and it was priced like an S550
[16:52:05] <sintax> catbeard: insurance doesn't cover maintenance
[16:52:10] <estranger> insurance doesn't cover breakage
[16:52:11] <vinrock> he got the full extended warranty
[16:52:16] <catbeard> it does with comprehensive
[16:52:16] <vinrock> made out like a fuckin bandit
[16:52:25] <sintax> nice
[16:52:35] <vinrock> car was undervalued like $60k or some silly shit

[16:53:17] <catbeard> had i have had comprehensive, my trans/radiator would have been fixed 2 weeks ago
[16:53:27] <catbeard> but nooo i had to get liability
[16:53:40] <catbeard> they wouldn't even tow my car
[16:53:47] <estranger> I need to check my policy.. I have everything on it from nationwide
[16:53:53] <JollyRgrs> catbeard: why not just call it a radiator? why do you have to tell us it is a trans?

[16:54:15] <Oliber> my transmission is non-binary
[16:54:17] <vinrock> he jumped the car
[16:54:17] <PublicWiFi> or was it a radiator and transcooler?

[17:39:13] <PublicWiFi> SpookyGibby: LOL
[17:39:21] <vinrock> estranger: The front derailleur should run parallel to the chainrings.  If it doesn't, slacken the bolt fastening it to the frame and rotate it into the right position.  When directly above the largest chainring, the outside edge of the derailleur should sit 2-3mm above the teeth of the chainring.

[18:10:28] <PublicWiFi> none of it was military related, but he was in the miltary at the time so it all stacked up against his medical disability case lol
[18:10:39] <PublicWiFi> ended up having enough wrong with him to get it lmfao, its only partial but damn

[18:14:36] <PublicWiFi> you sound like the admin before me
[18:14:58] <PublicWiFi> hey what happens to duo in the event the WAN goes down? what kind of failover does it have?
[18:15:04] <SpookyGibby> just enroll everyone and dont tell them
[18:15:12] <sintax> There's an offline version so you can just input 6 numbres
[18:15:16] <sintax> numbers
[18:15:18] <PublicWiFi> ah
[18:15:21] <sintax> or if the duo site can't be reached
[18:15:25] <sintax> you can cause it to bypass

[18:15:30] <SpookyGibby> instead of push
[18:15:31] <PublicWiFi> gotcha
[18:15:37] <SpookyGibby> like gewgal auth

[18:16:09] <sintax> eek
[18:16:16] <sintax> i don't trust my users to not lose them
[18:16:25] <PublicWiFi> "if you lose this its a write-up"
[18:16:25] <sintax> they are less likely to lose their phone

[18:16:42] <PublicWiFi> was jk anyways

[18:16:48] <sintax> for sure
[18:16:49] <SpookyGibby> $45 charge goes to the department that they're in
[18:16:51] <sintax> but at 45 a pop
[18:16:54] <SpookyGibby> bosses will take note
[18:16:57] <sintax> true
[18:17:08] <PublicWiFi> i know personally i own 2 just in case, how does an enterprise handle that?
[18:17:19] <PublicWiFi> you're just enrolling them with your CA I guess right?
[18:18:54] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Why use Yubikey for "something you have" when you can just use biometrics

[18:19:14] <PublicWiFi> i was about to give you a speech
[18:19:17] <PublicWiFi> LOL

[18:19:26] <csws> rather than any old shit
[18:19:36] <PublicWiFi> i mean what happens if they lose their key, you can just reenrolled all their shit at once?
[18:19:39] <sintax> I'll be importing the groups that I would want using aad and then start with leadership/it and then roll out from there. 
[18:19:55] <csws> PublicWiFi, reset their auth method and send them to aka.ms/mfasetup
[18:20:01] <sintax> PublicWiFi: if they lose their key with duo you can set to bypass so they can login and then get them a new yubi key
[18:20:07] <PublicWiFi> ah nice
[18:20:27] <PublicWiFi> I'm gonna implement smart card auth for me and admin accounts soon, prolly with yubikeys
[18:20:28] <sintax> duo is easy to set one person to bypass. their admin panel is very friendly.
[18:20:37] <PublicWiFi> but i want to do smartcard auth for clevels too I think, or try to get them to lol
[18:20:50] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lol
[18:20:52] <sintax> anyone with access to the network should have some form of 2fa
[18:21:02] <csws> yeah I think you can configure slot 2 as smart card and leave slot 1 for the normal shit
[18:21:13] <csws> that's how mine is setup right now as keepassxc supports hardware keys this way

[18:23:38] <csws> so you're going to read their door access cards or something?
[18:24:25] <csws> aren't those easy as hell to clone?
[18:24:48] <PublicWiFi> csws: funny you say that I've been trying to find affordable cards that have both smart card interface and a 125Khz RFID
[18:24:48] <csws> or at least get the card number off of them to make your own smart card.. even if it can't open the doors
[18:24:59] <SpookyGibby> yes, most smart cards are easy to clone
[18:25:04] <PublicWiFi> yeah i dont want to use RFID cards to auth

[18:27:32] <csws> they have a spooky version of the tunnel tour I think
[18:27:37] <sintax> the bad thing here is people are in different groups for different locations. So I need to create groups for each branch with everyone that works there so then i can roll out to each branch and not 1. miss anyone. 2. double up some one. our groups are a mess

[21:01:13] <spiderman> @SilentMutiny dehecent
[21:01:20] <dragonfleas> What are Unix domain sockets? like why is there a web socket connected to chronyd, is that how it keeps time sync? i thought time sync was clock based, or is it a secondary check?
[21:01:47] <dragonfleas> 'unix 2 dgram /var/run/chrony/chronyd.sock'
[21:01:48] <spiderman> dragonfleas: its a file that local processes can use to communicate over
[21:01:51] <dragonfleas> ah ok
[21:02:00] <dragonfleas> so it's just using web sockets to communicate internally?
[21:02:10] <spiderman> exactly
[21:02:14] <dragonfleas> or are those unix domain sockets unique?
[21:02:23] <CptLuxx> has nothing to do with web lol
[21:02:28] <dragonfleas> yeah they aren't web sockets
[21:02:32] <dragonfleas> i'm looking them up right now lol
[21:02:34] <spiderman> its a local-only way for processes to communicate using the same code they use to communicate with external network serviecs
[21:02:49] <technonerd_> It's a file it speaks to, zero network 
[21:02:53] <dragonfleas> SOCK_DGRAM vs UDP
[21:03:17] <dragonfleas> there are SOCK_STREAMS, DGRAM, and SEQPACKETs
[21:03:48] <dragonfleas> 'The API for Unix domain sockets is similar to that of an Internet socket, but rather than using an underlying network protocol, all communication occurs entirely within the operating system kernel.'
[21:03:53] <dragonfleas> Interesting
[21:03:56] <sd> 02<S​ilentMutiny> spiderman: you like that? :D
[21:04:09] <spiderman> the point is that the kernel's api for sending and receiving data is the same whether you use a web socket or a unix socket
[21:04:10] <dragonfleas> So it's not using network protocols at all, just sockets specifically for inter-communication
[21:04:12] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@proxy.cloud-in.space) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[21:04:26] <dragonfleas> yeah because it's lower level than the web or unix abstraction
[21:04:29] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> IPC
[21:04:37] <spiderman> the unix socket just never passes through netfilter/nftables
[21:04:38] <dragonfleas> 👍
[21:06:07] <dragonfleas> ok can i ask a question that may seem stupid
[21:06:30] <dragonfleas> but why the fuck does selinux come enforcing by default, but doesn't come pre packaged with good tooling to troubleshoot
[21:06:36] <spiderman> dragonfleas: I don't know with any degree of certainty, but I'd say that chronyd has an api, and there are some commands to manage your system time that communicate with the daemon over that domain socket
[21:06:59] <dragonfleas> like setroubleshoot-server are all external packages 
[21:07:07] <dragonfleas> why would they not include those tools from the start
[21:07:09] <spiderman> those are very third-party
[21:07:13] <dragonfleas> yeah
[21:07:20] <spiderman> you're on a rhel server right?
[21:07:41] <dragonfleas> is there first party selinux troubleshooting tooling? spare audit logs
[21:07:45] <spiderman> they try to keep things bare minimum. Like having vi, but not vim
[21:08:00] <spiderman> its called /var/log/audit/audit.log
[21:08:04] <spiderman> or ausearach
[21:08:08] <spiderman> ausearch
[21:08:18] <spiderman> do ausearch -m avc to show all selinux violations

[22:47:43] <CableNinja> its 'ok', but I much preferred chef because you could easily shoehorn ruby code in and do fancy stuff, vs ansible having limited loop conditions

[22:48:23] <CableNinja> the 'hcl' type language of chef was so much better than ansible yaml
[22:49:47] <CableNinja> last I messed with salt was like 8 years ago or so, right around the time that coreos and docker started becoming a thing. salt was difficult for me to manage, but I think its because I didnt have a grasp on terminology and the real workings like I do now with most of those tools

[23:04:31] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or your using json and everything has to injected as a string then santised

[23:05:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yes but not date, raw
[23:05:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or other useful shit
[23:05:29] <CableNinja> date is either an int or a string anyway

[23:05:57] <CableNinja> and raw data would be string and if you need special chars it'd be base64'd in almost any markup/lang
[23:06:51] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> @Haise i should pick ur brain tbh, I've got no one where I am that knows how libvirt works so most of my shit is either ripped from google or guessing

[23:11:03] <sd> 09<H​aise> @HurdyGurdyBurdy  I am currently even trying to remove image building part

[23:11:21] <sd> 09<H​aise> and hit them with cloud-init while Terraforming
[23:11:36] <CableNinja> provision time takes much longer in that case
[23:11:57] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> my dream setup for it was to have kickstarts that are built for specific types of centos installs and then just run a script and select the kickstarter i want
[23:11:59] <CableNinja> and you also may not get the same packages every time unless you pin lots, which can be important
[23:12:24] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> then use ansible to ensure everything is up-to-date
[23:12:26] <sd> 09<H​aise> fair point CableNinja
[23:12:34] <sd> 09<H​aise> depends on use case and how you build your environment
[23:12:37] <CableNinja> yeah
[23:13:12] <CableNinja> all of our stuff is based on golden image type stuff, that way we make sure that everything is always the same for everyone except the deviants

[23:15:10] <sd> 09<H​aise> yeah that makes sense for golden image
[23:15:28] <sd> 09<H​aise> @HurdyGurdyBurdy I just grab cloud image from Red Hat and SUSE and work from there
[23:15:51] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> yeah i should honestly change to doing that rather than grabbing a local iso
[23:16:10] <sd> 09<H​aise> you could experiment with it
[23:16:14] <sd> 09<H​aise> and see if it fits your bill
[23:16:14] <CableNinja> we build repos with specific package versions, then use an iso and pxe to do installs via an automatic install script, generate an image from that, and distribute. cloud stuff we clone that image over via chroot and packer
[23:16:40] <CableNinja> last few months have been me automating the install, image and distribution

[23:17:35] <sd> 09<H​aise> Packer is fantastic for building golden images imo

[23:18:18] <sd> 09<H​aise> CableNinja: I had similar scenario but with Terraform
[23:18:21] <CableNinja> we use the ebs chroot builder for AWS, which stands up a temp VM with a second disk that we do our install on and it saves that disk as the image instead of the vm it made
[23:18:24] <sd> 09<H​aise> Libvirt provider can be quirky at time
[23:18:34] <CableNinja> GCP doesnt have such a provider so I had to replicate the functionality in scripts
[23:18:44] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> same haise. Terraform is missing a lot of features for Azure data factory
[23:18:56] <CableNinja> oof is it?
[23:19:04] <sd> 09<H​aise> I haven't dived deep with Azure
[23:19:09] <sd> 09<H​aise> but I heard its not fantastic with TF

[23:19:19] <CableNinja> we're about to start making azure images and stuff soon, which also means providing TF stuff for azure
[23:19:28] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> but just use ARM templates for data factory
[23:19:32] <sd> 09<H​aise> CableNinja: take a look at Pulumi as well

[23:21:58] <sd> 09<H​aise> problem was that cloud-init used IDE interface

[23:22:15] <sd> 09<H​aise> so it was running around circles like a monkey
[23:22:23] <sd> 09<H​aise> till I dived into code
[23:23:16] <CableNinja> thats one of the reasons that I like the chroot image method we've done. we dont have to deal with that as the image is already done before it even makes it to the cloud

[23:48:48] <CableNinja> I just finished up the POC for an automated test pipeline. we had 'something' in place, but a lot of our tests are actually 'destructive' in that they dont leave a clean system, so much of the testing was done on a single system that someone manhandled

[23:49:55] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> This is the way

[23:50:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> It's easier to use tools like packer to just make a new VM every time
[23:50:37] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> vagrant might be able to handle that though
[23:50:48] <CableNinja> we have an ansible script that does it
[23:50:54] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> even easier
[23:51:18] <CableNinja> stands up a vm ready for dev/production in like 10-15 minutes max; and most of that is waiting for the vm template to clone
[23:51:58] <sd> 08<K​ubi Abriel> ok, I'm not super knowledgeable about ansible et al, desktop side mostly here. The only VM I have is not really for production (test desktop VM for SCCMy things)
[23:52:03] <CableNinja> snapshotting wouldnt really work because we'd have to simultaneously snapshot multiple disks to make a snapshot restore properly
[23:52:34] <CableNinja> all of our stuff is ZFS backed, and we use zfs snapshots heavily, but even that isnt clean enough of a restoration for some things
