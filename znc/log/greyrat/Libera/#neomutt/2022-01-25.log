[14:24:58] <flatcap> how are you?

[14:32:40] <gahr> oh
[14:32:44] <gahr> (I'm fine thanks!)
[14:33:33] <gahr> what happened the last time he said he would step down?
[14:34:37] <flatcap> good :-)
[14:34:48] <flatcap> he had a few weeks off with his family
[14:35:44] <flatcap> a couple of days have passed. two people have thanked him and one more in #mutt
[14:35:53] <flatcap> no offers of leadership :-)

[14:49:04] <flatcap> :-)
[15:25:06] <gour> well, imho, neomutt does prove for itself that it manages project well...moreover, i doubt that without neomutt initiative there would be much mutt activity whatsoever
[15:25:41] * gahr back
[15:26:03] <gahr> we are missing a couple of features from mutt yet, don't we?
[15:26:27] <gahr> background compose comes to mind
[15:26:55] <gahr> (not that I particularly thing we should have it :))
[15:27:11] <flatcap> yes, that's one of the larger missing pieces
[15:27:34] <flatcap> there's a bunch of colour improvements, but I've got a branch for that :-)
[15:29:13] <flatcap> this repo contains a fairly up-to-date list: https://github.com/neomutt/upstream-patches
[15:29:33] <flatcap> vi m1; source "work.vim"
[15:29:54] <flatcap> work.vim contains a key to letters/colours
[15:30:29] <flatcap> there's a lot of bitty things like converting functions to use Buffers
[15:31:00] <flatcap> but there's quite a few improvements/fixes we could do with too

[15:44:14] <flatcap> oh, yes
[15:44:32] <flatcap> I'm not actually sure how I'll make them work, yet :-)
[15:44:59] <gahr> I'll watch :)
[15:45:37] <flatcap> updated
[15:47:28] <gahr> are you / dcpurton planning to work on #3200 as part of the bigger neomutt-webkit initiative? :D
[15:47:29] <neo-bot> Issue by @wgmayer0 "Save all attachments with a keybinding": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3200
[15:47:56] <flatcap> not me, but dcpurton seems keen to
[15:48:11] <gahr> ok I'll leave it to him then, I don't want both of us to be touching the attachment code at the same time
[15:48:32] <flatcap> what did you have in mind?
[15:48:54] * flatcap has a secret attachments branch too
[15:49:12] <gahr> nothing specific yet
[15:49:26] <flatcap> ok
[15:49:31] <gahr> basically this feature here:L https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3200#issuecomment-1017241067
[15:49:51] <gahr> automatic suffic to avoid clashes + automatic naming of unnamed parts + <save-all> function
[15:49:54] <gahr> suffix
[15:50:18] <flatcap> ooh, tricky
[15:51:27] <flatcap> I haven't got far yet, but I was looking at eliminating `Body->tagged` and moving it to `AttachPtr->tagged`
[15:51:53] <flatcap> to eliminate AttachCtx (a view object) from all the deep attachment code
[15:52:24] <gahr> consider me unaware of how attachments are implemented, I haven't looked at the code yet
[15:52:44] <gahr> but moving tagged makes sense
[15:52:48] <flatcap> hehe, ok.  I suggest not looking :-)
[15:53:03] <gahr> like removing email->tagged would make sense
[15:53:20] <flatcap> yeah
[15:53:36] <flatcap> I've thought the same, but not looked at how we'd make that happen
[15:56:21] <flatcap> we're a step close with Emails, though. el_add_tagged() hides some of the details, so we pass a simple List to functions
[15:58:14] <flatcap> oh. cirrus still isn't working.  if you've got a sec, could you take a look
[15:58:35] <flatcap> or perhaps, try it locally and see if cirrus is the problem
[16:01:31] <gahr> the rocksdb package is not there yet
[16:01:40] <flatcap> oh, ok
[16:01:51] <gahr> I don't know why it's taking so long
[16:03:16] <flatcap> ok, thanks.  I might turn off cirrus for a while, then
[16:04:04] <gahr> sure
[16:04:10] <gahr> I'm trying to figure it out
[16:17:07] <gahr> oh, it was fixed but then it was broken again :(
[16:17:24] <flatcap> damn :-(
[16:19:22] <flatcap> I've temp disabled rocksdb
[16:22:06] <gahr> thanks

[17:17:00] <bitigchi> I am having trouble displaying IMAP folders with non A-Z characters in them. Do I need to escape them somehow? 
[17:18:26] <gahr> which chars?
[17:20:37] <bitigchi> It differs. I can display a folder with Ä± in it, but Ä°, ÄŸ, ÅŸ, Ã¼ (although it's ASCII) is a no go.
[17:21:28] <bremner> that's not _actually_ ASCII.
[17:21:32] <bremner> fwiw
[17:22:08] <gahr> was about to say the same :)
[17:23:05] <gahr> bitigchi: what happens? Does the folder name get garbled or the folder doesn't appear at all in your mailboxes list?
[17:23:55] <bitigchi> bremner: I meant Ã¼, that's in ASCII AFAIK.
[17:24:04] <bremner> really not. 
[17:24:15] <bremner> But maybe ASCII is the wrong thing to focus on?
[17:24:23] <bitigchi> gahr: It says mailbox does not exist "NONEXISTENT"
[17:24:46] <bremner> "man ascii" if you want the (small) complete set
[17:25:09] <bitigchi> That's with the sidebar, if I do directory list, it just lists empty, only showing the .. go to parent entry
[17:26:00] <bitigchi> Something with the file mask maybe?
[17:28:18] <gahr> is that a local mailbox?
[17:28:25] <gahr> or directly on the IMAP server?
[17:30:37] <bitigchi> It's directly on the IMAP server. Tried with a Cyrillic name now, it showed up okay.
[17:30:45] <bitigchi> Maybe it's an iCloud quirk, I don't know

[17:32:24] <gahr> did you create those folders from within NeoMutt?
[17:32:25] <bitigchi> I'll file a bug upstream in any case
[17:32:36] <gahr> can you give me a complete example of a folder name that doesn't shot up?
[17:32:52] <gahr> are you sure you're still subscribed to those folders?
[17:33:51] <bitigchi> gahr: try YazÄ±ÅŸmalar -- i'll double check subscriptions now
[17:35:49] <flatcap> that reminds me.  one diff between Mutt and NeoMutt...
[17:36:33] <flatcap> NeoMutt still turns the SUB into a `mailboxes` command.  Mutt changed the code to call the function directly
[17:37:06] <gahr> mh, so we might screw some quoting up?
[17:37:37] <gahr>  39         +YazÄ±ÅŸmalar
[17:37:38] <flatcap> possibly
[17:37:40] <gahr> works fine

[17:38:19] <gahr> :)
[17:38:35] <gahr> doesn't mean we don't have a bug
[17:39:13] <bitigchi> In my case behaviour is the same between mutt and neomutt. Neomutt only reports an additional error on startup that some mailboxes are not available (more verbose I guess).

[18:07:01] <bitigchi> "imaps://username@imap.mail.me.com"
[18:07:36] <bitigchi> for SMTP, replace imap after the @ with smtp
[18:07:50] <bitigchi> and the header

[19:38:45] <gahr> if you "file" your config file, does it tell you UTF-8 Unicode text?

[19:42:57] <bitigchi> gahr: my icloud file was indeed ASCII text, converted it to Unicode (a glimpse of hope), but still didn't work :))
[19:43:22] <gahr> how did you encode that folder name in ascii?
[19:44:47] <bitigchi> I have no idea. Probably my vim did that somehow ages ago, and it was left like that. The file name is just "icloud" by the way.

[19:51:46] <bitigchi> Just for the record, I've also tried setting LC_ALL and LANG to en_US.UTF-8, but did not help either.
[19:52:52] <bitigchi> Maybe it's something related to the Homebrew build?
[19:54:03] <bookworm> do you even have those locales generated?
[19:54:57] <bookworm> (although that one fairly standard but if you are on a foreign local you might have just the one you've configured compiled)
[19:55:04] <bookworm> one is*
[19:56:16] <bitigchi> bookworm: I am not sure. When I change locales the interface language changes as well, I think it works
[19:56:24] <gahr> it's not about our locales
[19:56:36] <gahr> it's about neomutt reading the correct sequence of bytes from your config file
[19:56:44] <gahr> can you run with -d5
[19:56:49] <gahr> and see what happens on the imap level?
[19:57:04] <bookworm> yeah but setting LC_ALL only works if the locale exists
[19:57:33] <bookworm> in any case I'll shut up. Good luck :)

[20:36:09] <gahr> I honestly don't know why you don't get that folder back
[20:36:17] <gahr> but you do with imap_check_subscribed
[20:44:26] <gahr> I have tried with a minimal config file that only contains the following

[20:44:47] <gahr> mailboxes =YazÄ±ÅŸmalar
[20:45:00] <gahr> forget about set_private, it's for keeping my user/pass safe
