[14:54:06] <Carbonflux> its funny they are unpacking it before the L2 insertion.
[14:56:00] <Carbonflux> maybe all the thrust events are past
[14:56:45] <Faux> Manshley said they only have thrusters on one side so if they miss they're fucked.
[14:57:34] <Carbonflux> i really hope they don't miss, its been a LONG road to this point.
[15:00:06] <Carbonflux> i was just wondering tho, with the sun-shield unfolded and stuff, it seems to me that applying thrust would be harmful at this point.
[15:01:07] <Carbonflux> assuming the sun shield does unfold correctly, looks like that is where its at now.
[15:01:32] <Carbonflux> unfolding.
[15:01:40] <Faux> Why? It has basically no mass/momentum, and there's no air, no air.
[15:02:56] <Carbonflux> well, technically this close to the sun its not even close to a vacuum, but i guess it is a small enough structure, mostly i was thinking about the stress on the structure of the sun shield itself.
[15:03:59] <Carbonflux> i would want to keep it packed up until i was done with thrust corrections.
[15:04:20] <Carbonflux> in effect, wait until L2 before unpacking stuff.
[15:05:06] <Faux> Stress from momentum? They're probably accelerating it at less than walking pace.
[15:06:10] <Carbonflux> you know what i mean.
[15:07:14] <Carbonflux> i guess they figure its strong enough
[15:07:22] <ERROH> wtf what :D
[15:07:29] <Carbonflux> i was just surprised is all.
[15:08:14] <Faux> Apparently LEO is 10^-8 torr; a "vacuum" for e.g. manufacturing is like 10^-4 torr I thought.
[15:08:31] <Faux> 10^-4 torr is where you are talking about air molecules like tennis balls, instead of fluids.

[15:13:27] <ERROH> you cerebrum is uniform though
[15:13:40] <Faux> I assume a spatula is a single, like, folicule.
[15:13:46] <Carbonflux> are you really going to insist that the solar wind is a uniform field? just for the sake of stubbornness or something?
[15:14:29] <Carbonflux> its fluid dynamics, PDEs and stuff.
[15:14:36] <Faux> No, I'm going to claim it's a normally distributed field with a mean of seven orders of magnitude less than would matter; meaning the chance of it mattering is less than 0.0000000000.
