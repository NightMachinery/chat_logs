[00:11:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> anyone here can help me with python argparse question?
[00:11:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> trying to do this"having "num" as a positional argument in argparse, but when flag -n is used
[00:11:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> num no longer is positional and becomes optional, in other words having a positional and optional counter parts being mutually exclusive
[00:11:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> muttually exclusive = just means cant be used at the same time.
[00:11:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> arg: "num"(positional) and "-n"(optional) cant be used at the same time"
[00:11:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Thanks
[00:14:36] <Noisytoot> M3RELATIVISM[m]: Try asking in #python 
[00:15:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I not being able to join sadly
[00:15:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> dont know what is going on

[12:33:31] <epony> rindolf, your case is obvious, you live in a small country that depends on the US MIC for its survival and is a military base for control of the other countries around it, so you can't just stop supporting the MIC, but FSO is related to that in its support of economic and political regimes of US foreign policy and domination, so.. might as well consider you're not exactly a model of exemplary ethos

[17:45:13] <wyre> hi guys, apparently leading @s in gnu makefiles are to run that command silently, but ... I can see usually @echo "whatever"  
[17:45:25] <wyre> so ... what's the purpose of silencing an echo? 😆

[17:47:04] <kilobug> wyre: hi, @ silence the automatic echo of the command itself, not the output of the command; just « echo "whatever" » will display « echo "whatever" whatever » (on two lines), with the @ you'll just get the message without the echo command itself being printed

[22:13:51] <epony> the real problem with browsers is not some naming dispute, or licensing, it's the program implementation details and the qualities and reliability and modularity of it, so this fork solves nothing
[22:16:00] <epony> you will confirm over time that many such forks end up discarded due to rapid progress of the forked projects beyond the fork, and repetitive faults and same implementation choices of the monolithic and conflicting bundled sub-programs, providing no substantial viable project, but a very high cost of maintenance and upkeep
