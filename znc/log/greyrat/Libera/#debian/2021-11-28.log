[03:46:55] <somiaj> rawtaz: kernel upgrades require a reboot
[03:46:56] <Blondie101010> rawtaz:  well, considering that autoremove can remove things you might want, and some things are only tested properly with a reboot
[03:47:09] <somiaj> service updates will require you to restart services, there is a package that can help with this
[03:47:12] <somiaj> ,i needs-restart
[03:47:13] <judd> No package named 'needs-restart' was found in bullseye/amd64.
[03:47:37] <somiaj> ,i needrestart
[03:47:38] <judd> Package needrestart (admin, optional) in bullseye/amd64: check which daemons need to be restarted after library upgrades. Version: 3.5-4; Size: 60.8k; Installed: 293k; Homepage: https://github.com/liske/needrestart; Screenshot: https://screenshots.debian.net/package/needrestart
[03:47:42] <rawtaz> perhaps i was unclear. i dont mean to ask if i should reboot. i mean if it matters if i reboot before or after the `apt autoremove` command
[03:47:50] <rawtaz> i definitely do reboot :)
[03:47:57] <somiaj> That package will hook into apt and let you know if you should restart and or reboot after an upgrade.
[03:48:09] <rawtaz> (yeah i totally asked that the wrong way, i see that now)
[03:48:17] <somiaj> It shouldn't matter if you do it before or after
[03:48:17] *** Joins: cousteau (~cousteau@user/cousteau)
[03:48:30] <Blondie101010> but after a big update or cleanup, I suggest rebooting to validate the installation
[03:48:37] <rawtaz> yeah. so just to be super clear, thres no case you can thin of where it hurts to autoremove *before* the reboot?
[03:48:47] <somiaj> Most likely you are just removing unused libs with autoremove. I guess there could be an issue if running a program and then you autoremove it, the program will be running in memeory but may error out
[03:48:52] <rawtaz> Blondie101010: absolutely! gotta verify that stuff comes up as they should :)
[03:49:29] <rawtaz> somiaj: yeah. pretty low chances theres a problem but might as well continue to reboot first and then autoremove then :) i just became curious when reviewing my documentation
[03:49:46] <somiaj> rawtaz: the case I mentioned could even effect you before you reboot, but if you are autoremoving a package you are actually using, this is probably an error on your end, and you should always double check what is being autoremoved
[03:49:55] <rawtaz> another question; which is the recommended firewall to use on debian today? i guess nftables?
[03:50:02] <somiaj> but needrestart will tell you what you need to restart after an intsall, and you may find you don't have to reboot as often
[03:50:04] <rawtaz> somiaj: yeah indeed
[03:50:19] <somiaj> nftables is the default and recommended low level tool (even iptables is a wrapper for nftables in debian)
[03:50:23] <rawtaz> i like rebooting. makes me happy about knowing the system starts services as it should
[03:50:30] <somiaj> but many prefer some gui front end instead of using nftables directly
[03:50:51] <rawtaz> yeah. is there any tui front end that you'd recommend?
[03:51:21] <rawtaz> ive used some in the past but cant realy say i think they add much value because i have to do it the cli way at times anyway due to the frontends not managing too complex settings
[03:51:25] <somiaj> Do you need a firewall?
[03:51:34] <somiaj> I don't use one so I don't have any recommendations
[03:51:54] <rawtaz> yeah, *unfortunately*.. thing is im working on some servers hosted at a provider where theres no way of having a private network and/or a firewall or similar in front of the server.

[03:53:19] <rawtaz> its nothing complex, just need to close everything but specific ports so no biggie
[03:54:48] <somiaj> For a simple setup, I would just learn the nft syntax, but that is just me
[03:54:59] <somiaj> ufw is one that comes to mind as I see others mention it here
[03:55:23] <somiaj> don't get confused that it depends on iptables, iptables is just a wrapper for nftables anyways, it is just the writers of ufw haven't updated its syntax to support nftables directly

[03:55:46] <Blondie101010> I've edited nft configs but I don't know it at all by heart, unlike iptables with which I'm very fluent
[03:56:46] <rawtaz> personaly i really like the nft syntax much more, because it's like pf

[04:35:05] <randall> rawtaz: docker is not a tool to isolate things. It's a tool to provide a reproducible environment. Isolation is pretty much non-existant on docker.

[04:38:52] <randall> rawtaz: Anything running as root in the container can access any ressources on the host. So if you can only run things that have no malintent, that's no isolation, that's just providing a stable environment.
[04:40:02] <randall> It just prevents that updating things on one container doesn't affect other containers. But isolation is (and has always been) pretty much not there. Upstream doesn't even hide the fact.

[04:54:51] <Khepra> rawtaz: I believe there's misunderstanding here. Naturally, you can't access host's filesystems unless they're bound into the namespace, or there's a bug
[04:55:20] <Khepra> however if the namespace exposes host's /dev(ices), chances are you just might simply `mount`
[04:55:34] <rawtaz> Khepra: that would make sense to me (what you said). but the way im reading randall it sounds like a root user inside a container effectively can do whatever root on the host can. unless i misunderstood you randall.

[04:58:57] <Khepra> rawtaz: if you're getting better help there, sure. otherwise this channel is in no way inferior.
[04:59:05] <rawtaz> Khepra: yes, understood. im running docker. but in this example case - where i havent mounted anything into the container, i literally just run that command above
[04:59:50] <rawtaz> Khepra: i agree. its just that when i asked randall what command i could use inside the container to mount the host root fs he suggested i had to go to the oftc channel :)
[04:59:57] <rawtaz> look, let's rewind. its really simple.
[05:00:22] <Khepra> rawtaz: if /dev pseudofs is exposed in the namespace, you can probably also just `mount` unless there's capabilities involved.
[05:00:26] <rawtaz> i understand the basics of docker, i have been using it quite a lot (mostly for development though), and i do understand some of how it works behind the scenes (not an expert!)
[05:01:05] <rawtaz> i keep hearing that one can easily break out of containers, especially if you are root in them. but i honestly never ever saw an actual concrete example of this simple breakout. so thats what im curious about.
[05:01:25] <rawtaz> im simply trying to understand what i am missing. if this is so simple, why dont i understand how to do it :/
[05:01:57] <Khepra> rawtaz: do _what_ exactly. what you've presented so far smells like !xy problem
[05:02:02] <rawtaz> Khepra: yeah. but in the example i gave you above, is the /dev pseudofs exposed in the namespace in such a way that i can simply mount the host fs or similar?
[05:02:03] *** Joins: catman (~catman@user/catman)
[05:02:14] <Khepra> it's not normal to want to mount anything from the host, inside the container
[05:02:14] <rawtaz> Khepra: im not sure if im being unclear.
[05:02:18] <Khepra> *from inside the container
[05:02:56] <rawtaz> again, i am being told that its simple to break out of a container, or rather that if im root in the container i effectively have root on the host. im simply asking "how? - what command can i run in the container, as root, to do something rooty on the host?"

[05:03:14] <rawtaz> i agree. it's what an attacker would do. im just trying to understand how you'd do it.
[05:03:18] <Khepra> rawtaz: it's not as simple. there are three, if not four barriers here
[05:03:44] <Khepra> first is the UID. a "root" in the container can have UID=0, but to the kernel, it's unprivileged user UID=over9000
[05:03:59] <rawtaz> even if one didnt enable userns?
[05:04:04] <Khepra> this is called unprivileged containers, when the first process started from the host is not real UID=0
[05:04:20] <Khepra> if you don't have userNS then you can't do this and root in the namespace IS the actual UID=0 root
[05:04:29] <rawtaz> yes
[05:04:39] <Khepra> so we come to the second barrier. namespace capabilities that can render even UID=0 inside it, impotent for some scenarios
[05:04:55] <Khepra> bugs notwithstanding of course
[05:05:15] <Khepra> third barrier is seccomp and friends, and mandatory access control for the namespaced process, but that's not in docker's domain
[05:05:50] <Khepra> now... what docker does exactly, I don't know in detail, excpe that there have been (A lot of) bugs in the way docker (mis)configures the namespaces and leaves exploitable vectors
[05:05:55] <rawtaz> yes, i agree and understand
[05:05:58] <rawtaz> im all with you
[05:06:15] <Khepra> rawtaz: whether it is or isn't depends on the namespace configuration
[05:06:19] <rawtaz> Khepra: please, can we rewind slightly.. can we please discuss the example where i 1) install a vanilla debian bullseye; 2) install docker, 3) run `docker run --rm -it alpine` and enter a root shell inside that container.
[05:06:41] <rawtaz> in that example - how can i do something inside that continer that shows that i effectively have root control on the host?
[05:06:52] <rawtaz> that is all i am asking - just a concrete example
[05:07:02] <Khepra> I don't know OTOH, what holes does docker leave by default, if any
[05:07:13] <rawtaz> (im not trying to question anyone, im just looking for a concrete example of what randall said earlier, which is this)
[05:07:19] <Khepra> that, again, depends on the configuration of the particular namespace.
[05:07:25] <rawtaz> yeah, let's assume theres no bugs heh :-)
[05:07:43] <Khepra> not just bugs, but (mis)configurations of the namespace
[05:07:45] <rawtaz> Khepra: well the configuration is the default one, as per my example above. no special configuration made. just those steps
[05:07:49] <Khepra> rw bound /dev is one such example
[05:07:57] <Khepra> (and no capabilities)
[05:08:06] <rawtaz> only those steps: 1) install a vanilla debian bullseye; 2) install docker, 3) run `docker run --rm -it alpine`
[05:08:15] <Khepra> I don't know what alpine dock(er) does by default
[05:08:40] <rawtaz> it's only busybox :)
[05:09:13] <Khepra> I am talking about the configuration of the namespace
[05:09:25] <rawtaz> err, thats wrong. i mean the alpine userspace which is mostly busybox
[05:09:43] <rawtaz> Khepra: but thats not something the docker *image* (alpine in this case) can control, right?
[05:09:49] <Khepra> yes it is
[05:09:59] <rawtaz> hmm
[05:10:02] <Khepra> that's what I'm trying to tell you, that's the namespace configuration
[05:10:27] <Khepra> every dock(er) comes with knobs to control the host side daemons behaviour in how it sets up the namespace
[05:10:36] <Khepra> bind mounts, caps, privilege level, ...
[05:10:42] <rawtaz> can you give an example of what namespace configuration the/a docker image can control?
[05:11:07] <rawtaz> all of those things you mention are AFAIK something you control/define/configure when you *run* the container, not when the image is built
[05:11:50] <rawtaz> and in this example i am not doing any bind mounts, cap changes (its the default caps, of course), not changing privileges (so it has default values there)
[05:12:22] <rawtaz> i mean, a Dockerfile cant say "oh ok, i also want capability X Y and Z", thats something you define when you run the contianer
[05:12:34] <rawtaz> s/oh ok/oh btw/
[05:14:07] <rawtaz> randall: sorry, but am i being unclear in my descriptions?  given 1) install a vanilla debian bullseye; 2) install docker, 3) run `docker run --rm -it alpine`, how can i in that root shell do something that effectively makes me root on the host?
[05:14:23] <rawtaz> i dont understand why noone can give me a simple example :o
[05:14:44] <rawtaz> im 100% just trying to understand if i am missing something obvious/simple here.

[05:18:06] <rawtaz> the way i understood what randall said earlier was in summary that with a basic docker setup (no misconfiguration, just defaults everywhere) a process/user being root inside the container (which also means they are running as root on the host) effectively has root powers on the host.

[08:42:15] <Gerowen> So I apparently broke EFI on a boot drive for my desktop...
[08:43:08] <Gerowen> Booted the machine from Clonezilla to clone a drive I had in a USB dock.  Decided it was going too slow so I shut it down, disconnected my OS drive and plugged the drive I was cloning directly into those SATA cables.  Performed the clone, put everything back, now it won't boot.  The drive shows up, but not as EFI bootable.
[08:45:54] <xx> does it have the efi partition?
[08:58:15] <Gerowen> I've got my USB drive dock busy at the moment, but when it's done I'll pop it out and stick it in and check.

[09:59:34] <Gerowen> Really no idea what happened, unless something screwy happened with that USB dock in the middle of it reading drives and caused Clonezilla to herp out and do something to GRUB/EFI.
[10:00:08] <Gerowen> It didn't bother the drive I was actually making an image of, I stuck it back in my server after it was done and it booted right up.

[19:39:39] <randall> JordiGH: Use python3. If you symlink /usr/bin/python to python3, you risk running py2 programs being run as py3, which might have unintended side effects.
[19:40:14] <JordiGH> Let's bring on the side effects. This isn't Haskell.

[19:52:06] <NieDzejkob> Hi, I made the mistake of trying to update from Stretch to Bullseye, skipping Buster. apt failed when it tried to run pam-auth-update - perl couldn't find libcrypt.so.1
[19:52:10] *** Joins: Delf (Delf@user/delf)
[19:52:32] <NieDzejkob> su and sudo got broken, booting anything but init=/bin/bash hangs
[19:53:26] <NieDzejkob> I assume the best course of action would be to set /etc/apt/sources.list to Buster and run update && dist-upgrade
[19:53:53] *** Quits: nssy2 (~nssy@user/nssy) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:54:27] <NieDzejkob> but apt complains about some of the packages being too new already, suggests running apt --fix-broken install which wants to remove a lot of stuff including apt itself. Yeah, not doing that.
[19:54:44] *** Joins: nssy2 (~nssy@user/nssy)
[19:55:31] <jmcnaught> You need to manually downgrade all of the packages that have been upgraded from stretch to bullseye back to stretch first.  And unfortunately .debs are not designed to be downgraded, it's meant to be a one-way street.
[19:55:36] <jmcnaught> !partial downgrade
[19:55:37] <dpkg> This may or may not work for you, but if you've got nothing to lose then try it: (a) change sources.list (b) aptitude update (c) aptitude and then search for the upgraded packages, hit enter on them, select the correct version (d) do the same for libc6 (e) search for broken packages by pressing "b" and then fix them in the same way (f) once you have no more broken packages, hit 'g'.  See <not available>.
[19:56:35] <alkisg> NieDzejkob: in such cases, I'm downgrading the packages using pin-priority=1001. I've kept notes there, you may use google translate if you like: https://alkisg.mysch.gr/steki/index.php?topic=7370.0
[19:57:00] <alkisg> I.e. I'm creating an apt preferences file, and then I run apt-get dist-upgrade, and it downgrades the packages to the versions of the current repositories
[19:57:20] <alkisg> That post talks for Ubuntu, but the same procedure works on Debian too (tested)

[20:47:17] <somiaj> Skipping a release is going to cause problems, at this point backup/reinstall is probably quicker and cleaner
[20:47:38] <randall> NieDzejkob: The problem is that the upgrade scripts in the packages only work in one direction, so you might break things without knowing it.

[20:48:45] <randall> NieDzejkob: Meaning that even if it seems to work, you can't trust the system to be in an ok state, which is why I'd do a fresh reinstall instead. Shouldn't be a lot of work, since I assume you did backups before upgrading.

[22:09:55] <dob1> Blondie101010, yes you right but imho it will be not masked
[22:10:29] <Blondie101010> I honestly never even considered masking a service I wrote myself so
[22:10:44] <dob1> infact systemctl list-unit-files --state=masked  doesn't list my service as masked and the ones that are masked here point to /dev/null
[22:10:54] <Blondie101010> if you want to admin your system, you need to be aware of what you're doing
[22:11:50] <Blondie101010> what does `systemctl mask foo` output since it can't update your service file?
[22:12:00] <Blondie101010> that should give an error imo
[22:12:32] <dob1> it gives the error that the file exists
[22:12:33] <Blondie101010> otherwise it does the mask differently (again, haven't tried it)

[23:50:04] <sussudio> !debootstrap
[23:50:05] <dpkg> debootstrap can create a basic Debian system from scratch, without apt/dpkg.  Useful for installing in a <chroot>. It is key to installing Debian GNU/Linux from a Unix/Linux system. http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap - https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/apds03.en.html

[23:53:27] <sney> for longer output, if you can't copy/paste, there is termbin:
[23:53:29] <sney> !termbin
[23:53:29] <dpkg> you can paste to termbin.com from terminal with redirections: try 'nc termbin.com 9999 < /path/to/file', or 'command | nc termbin.com 9999'
[23:56:27] <micr0> sney host container is `ubuntu 20.04 aarch64`, grabbing the debootstrap command shortly.
