[00:50:24] <akik> in the container
[00:50:59] <Lutin> akik :D
[00:51:07] <gebbione> id: '501': no such user
[00:51:21] <gebbione> but not sure why that is running as 501
[00:51:23] <akik> that looks like something to fix
[00:51:31] <gebbione> the point is that it should run as the node user
[00:51:32] <akik> maybe the files are owned by 501 ?
[00:52:03] <gebbione> they should not be
[00:52:27] <gebbione> NODEIMG := docker run --name elucidat_login --init --rm -v "$(PWD)/:/project" -v "$(HOMEPATH)/:/home/node" -e npm_config_cache=npm-cache -e HOME=/home/node -u $(UID):node -w /project node:6.14
[00:52:51] <gebbione> -u should map the local 501 to run as the node user
[00:53:08] <akik> gebbione: do you have a user 501 on the host? getent passwd 501
[00:53:30] <gebbione> the host is a mac
[00:53:36] <gebbione> getent won't work but yes
[00:53:44] <akik> oh ok in the linux vm then
[00:54:11] <gebbione> no linux vm
[00:54:18] <gebbione> this is just from mac to docker
[00:54:30] <akik> ok sorry i don't know how that works
[00:54:35] <gebbione> and the host has the user uid=501(bizmate)  ... but again it makes no sense that docker sees it
[00:54:46] <gebbione>  -u $(UID):node
[00:54:51] <akik> if you're sharing files from the host to the container it matters
[00:55:00] <gebbione> runs the container as if the local user is the node user in the container
[00:56:08] <gebbione> in my knowledge of docker the -u should do the host to docker container translation
[00:56:11] <gebbione> of the files too
[00:56:17] <gebbione> so permissions are maintained
[00:56:24] <gebbione> and it works seamlessly

[00:57:46] <akik> it's the default

[01:25:00] <gebbione> akik, the problem is not with the files ... it is with the -u $(UID):node override ... 
[01:25:16] <gebbione> $ id
[01:25:16] <gebbione> uid=501 gid=1000(node) groups=1000(node)
[01:25:28] <gebbione> and npm does not like that because 501 does not exist
[01:25:50] <gebbione> but if i don't run npm with this setting the files will not be generated by npm in a way that is compatible with the host
[01:26:00] <gebbione> and that is not great :/
[01:26:35] <gebbione> adding that user metadata should be built in
[01:26:48] <gebbione> as at run time it is not easy to do as -u could be any id
[01:27:38] <akik> gebbione: can you add a user into the container with uid 501?
[01:27:56] <gebbione> yes but i need to do it after build
[01:28:06] <gebbione> depending on the host 
[01:28:17] <gebbione> as the host does not always have a UID of 501
[01:28:55] <gebbione> so for every command i run within docker i have to create the user
[01:28:57] <gebbione> :/

[01:38:13] <tabakhase> yes its dirty, -u will work for a lot, but not everything (chmods, annon user without homedir and such make things blow)
[01:39:48] <gebbione> yep quite dirty and opinionated :) 
[01:40:02] <gebbione> i m just adding the mac default user 501
[01:40:23] <gebbione> it should work fine on linux as npm uses the same id of the standard linux user 1000
[01:40:28] <tabakhase> and "names" is a whole nother ordeal... cause kernel is shared, but only works in numbers, names is just /etc/passwd (group) stuff wich are NOT synced (((some usecases also make "-v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro" reasonable)))
[01:40:57] <gebbione> and i guess on windows it would still be the linux user as it is kinda emulated?
[01:41:10] <tabakhase> there is no such thing as "standard 1000" rly
[01:41:33] <tabakhase> windows is a whole nother deal again...
[01:42:22] <gebbione> it is interesting that -u works seamlessly but -v does not allow that kind of mapping
[01:42:41] <gebbione> it is indeed for development so i guess it is just not a major problem for production

[07:38:58] <guy_frm_yogaland> hello guys!
[07:39:14] <guy_frm_yogaland>  I need some help with php docker versions, I am new to programming and want to know what is the different between buster, fpm, zts, etc 
[07:40:01] <tabakhase> guy_frm_yogaland zts = zend thread safety
[07:40:17] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok
[07:40:40] <guy_frm_yogaland> so is there any rule/protocol for choosing the version of php docker image?
[07:41:26] <tabakhase> fpm is "multiple php processess run by a standalone coordinator" (opposed to say, mod_php in apache)
[07:41:47] <tabakhase> buster = debian version number, so underlaying OS (think they also have alpine images?)
[07:43:07] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok, i need to check if they have alpine image, my goal is to use php and composer and build a custom image using the dockerfile
[07:43:20] *** Quits: ash_worksi (~ash_m@user/ash-m/x-3292451) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[07:43:38] <tabakhase> for actual differences, this may make a little more, or also even less sense :D https://github.com/docker-library/php/tree/master/8.0/buster
[07:43:43] <guy_frm_yogaland> or is it possible to use single composer image? composer image comes with php inbuilt right?
[07:44:26] <tabakhase> "what you should use" depends, but unless you need apache(say for htaccess) fpm is perfectly fine
[07:45:16] <guy_frm_yogaland> actually, I intend to use nginx webserver, so I would need an image for that too, instead of apache
[07:45:27] <tabakhase> check out https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer
[07:45:39] <guy_frm_yogaland> let me check it
[07:46:38] <tabakhase> a ADD & RUN and you can nicely pull all extensions ((cause apt-get install php-mysql wont work there :P)) and with keys like "@composer" it will take care of that too
[07:47:43] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok
[07:49:08] <guy_frm_yogaland> thanks a lot
[07:52:16] *** Joins: ash_worksi (~ash_m@user/ash-m/x-3292451)
[07:56:54] <tabakhase> guy_frm_yogaland only other note to give ya is to read over best practices (espc. about caching your composer install by copying only composer.json/lock, installing, pulling in your code, and running composer again with a dump-autload - and to NOT copy vendor/ from the host (a ".dockerignore"-file is your friend)) --- and a note on the "breakup" when using bind-mounts instead for dev (as you 
[07:56:55] <tabakhase> dont need to compile php) and the potential uid/chmod havok with this... but you are certainly on the right way (including that idea about needing the nginx container yep) 
[07:57:26] <tabakhase> (as in, https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy )
[08:00:09] <guy_frm_yogaland> @tabakhase: can I add you for private dm?
[08:01:10] <tabakhase> best to keep it in here so everyone can jump in - especially as im about to jump out 5:30am... bed is waitin :D
[08:03:55] <guy_frm_yogaland> oh, I am from India here it is morning
[08:07:04] <tabakhase> 5:30am is technically morning too i guess ;D - just not so much when ya sepnd the night moving servers about =)
[08:08:12] <tabakhase> anywho, imma dip out, good luck

[09:07:58] <anon16_> Noob question: how do I distinguish between an official docker container and an unofficial one? I assume that official ones don't have a "/" in the name? 
[09:08:46] <guy_frm_yogaland> is that a container or an image that you are asking for?
[09:09:06] <guy_frm_yogaland> becuase there are official and unofficial images not containers
[09:09:23] <anon16_> Sorry, I meant an image
[09:09:28] <guy_frm_yogaland> oh, ok
[09:09:36] <guy_frm_yogaland> even I am a new beginner as well
[09:10:18] <guy_frm_yogaland> official images ae written as [official] on dockerhub 
[09:10:25] <guy_frm_yogaland> the registry for docker images
[09:10:33] <anon16_> Nice, thank you
[09:11:06] <guy_frm_yogaland> are you using command line for listing the available docker images?
[09:11:29] <guy_frm_yogaland> as I beginner I am using the docker hub to see all the tags and official builds
[09:12:03] <anon16_> Yeah but I don't mind using a browser, so I just checked their site to see
[09:13:12] <guy_frm_yogaland> would you like to connect with me?
[09:13:31] <guy_frm_yogaland> I am learning as well
[09:14:04] <anon16_> If by connect you mean chatting and stuff, sure
[09:14:24] <guy_frm_yogaland> yeah, but tech chatting I meant by that
[09:14:28] <anon16_> Yep
[09:14:31] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok
[09:14:36] <guy_frm_yogaland> check the dm
[09:21:36] <anon16_> btw, does anyone know the difference between debian:stable and debian:buster? I assume they point to the same image at the moment?

[16:33:31] <rapid16> WHich source?
[16:33:53] <artok> that my.cnf
[16:34:00] <artok> as the error states
[16:34:44] <rapid16> Yes it is theree
[16:36:36] <tabakhase> computer says no ;-)
[16:36:58] <rapid16> ls says it's there
[16:37:08] <tabakhase> ´file mysql/my.cnf` returns?
[16:37:15] <artok> and expected type?
[16:37:38] <rapid16> It says it's a directory
[16:37:53] <tabakhase> so computer is right =)
[16:37:57] <rapid16> Wait. that should be a file
[16:38:17] <tabakhase> if it doesnt exist, dockerD will create a directory
[16:38:31] <tabakhase> bind-mounts are to "ship things in" - you cant pull existing things "out"
[16:39:46] <rapid16> So I guess I replace it with a config file?
[16:41:11] <tabakhase> well, the whole reason to have that line at all would be you having a local cnf (say in your repo) that shall overwrite whatever was in the container - if you dont have one/need this, just drop it
[16:41:42] <rapid16> Drop it in config?
[16:41:57] <tabakhase> drop as in "delete line 55"

[22:02:13] <programmerq> use a build arg

[22:07:54] <tabakhase> and no you cant rly "automate" this after -- closest there is may be a env-file / ".env" if using docker-compose and a "run this first" command in your readme to write those out "before first boot"
[22:10:13] <tabakhase> depending on sys, $UID also exists by default

[23:21:50] <artok> usually commands are run serially and first one to return non-zero value is then stopping the execution
[23:23:57] <ada_> goddard: I don't think you can catch signals from an `exec`d command
[23:24:35] <ada_> trap i mean
[23:25:01] <goddard> maybe some grep magic?
[23:25:13] <ada_> no I'd probably write a function to do the work and just not use exec at all
[23:25:22] <ada_> then you could trap signals from the function inside the script
[23:25:44] <ada_> I mean, you don't need a function really, but yeah.  I think `exec` is going to replace the script execution with the `exec`d command
[23:25:59] <ada_> then your script code is not going to run any further
[23:26:52] <goddard> the full command i am doing was to get colored output but in a CI it might be irrelevent
