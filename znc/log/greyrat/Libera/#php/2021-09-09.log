[01:34:48] <Albright> coder7of9: Stop leaving. We're trying to answer your question. :P
[01:34:55] <coder7of9> sorry
[01:35:02] <__adrian> note, storing a backup on the same server is almost exactly like not having a backup
[01:35:21] <coder7of9> yes we have raid
[01:35:32] <biberu> why is PHP involved in taking backups?
[01:35:37] <__adrian> raid is not backup
[01:35:43] <coder7of9> this is daily backups and i will be using a separate  server  now
[01:35:52] <Albright> I'm currently using xz on a client site and I'm pretty happy with it but SQL data is "regular" enough that there's probably not a huge difference between the different compression algos. I do like that xz makes it easy to set the number of threads to be used when compressing though.
[01:37:00] <Albright> Yeah, get an Amazon S3 or equivalent account and push the compressed dumps to there, or get a cheap VPS with a lot of disk space and rsync to it.
[01:37:08] *** Quits: wovixo (~wovixo@128.104.205.49) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:37:29] <Albright> But yes, this isn't strictly a PHP question. :P
[01:37:31] <coder7of9> i am using cron to make an sql backup....
[01:37:48] <Albright> Yes, cron is fine for that.
[01:37:54] <coder7of9> okay not php
[01:38:28] <Albright> Just periodically check that the backups are actually being made and pushed, and that nothing has silently broken in that process.
[01:40:02] <coder7of9> yes they have been good ... so my question is    can i go directly  to zip   or must it be mysql file then zip    i think 1 g is too much for memory
[01:40:30] <Albright> Here's a PHP question. I found a job listing mentioning a "headless CMS." What is that? One with no admin control panel that just uses APIs to manipulate data or something?
[01:40:53] <__adrian> likely
[01:41:10] <Albright> coder7of9: I'd create the file first. That way if something goes wrong with the compression, you still have the original file. It's how I do it.
[01:41:26] <coder7of9> ok thanks
[01:41:27] <__adrian> "too much for memory"?
[01:41:51] <Albright> xz at least will delete the original file after creating an archive but you can change that behavior.
[01:42:32] <Albright> Also, note that if your dump has multiple SQL files, you'll need to use tar to bring them together into a single archive file first.
[01:45:04] <coder7of9> i saw an example where the file was in memory then sent to a zip ... i will not go this route
[01:45:53] <Albright> Yeah, that works fine for smaller files. For a 1GB file it will *probably* work too but I personally would rather not for something important.
[01:46:20] <biberu> hm? you can compress a stream without keeping it all in memory
[01:47:31] <biberu> what is php's role though? you mentioned passthru?
[01:49:50] <coder7of9> yes i am using passthru to call mysqldump
[01:50:03] <__adrian> :/
[01:50:20] <__adrian> php doesn't need to be involved
[01:51:05] <coder7of9> i can call mysqdump directly
[01:51:09] <coder7of9> okay i will try
[01:51:23] <coder7of9> tnanks :)
[01:51:42] <__adrian> is that why you were worried about memory? you were reading the dump into a variable in php?
[01:52:15] <coder7of9> yes
[01:52:15] <Albright> Oof
[01:52:37] <Albright> Naah, just use a shell script to invoke mysqldump directly and use > to put its output into a file.
[01:52:57] <Albright> eg, `mysqldump -u username -p password dbname > dbname.sql`

[01:53:44] <Albright> But hopefully that gets you started.
[01:54:11] <biberu> you can pipe it through something to compress it before writing to disk if you're low on space, or want faster transfers
[01:55:37] <coder7of9> speed is not important and once i start saving to a storage server space should be okay...

[06:22:38] <a|3x> my actual command doesn't use bash
[06:22:40] <a|3x> or sleep
[06:22:46] <Blondie101010> not the point
[06:22:48] <a|3x> the actual command is running a binary
[06:22:59] <a|3x> so there is no errors
[06:23:01] <Blondie101010> that error could really point you in the right direction
[06:23:08] <Blondie101010> yes, how come?
[06:23:26] <Blondie101010> why can't it run an executable that it finds and has permission to?
[06:23:34] <Blondie101010> probably because of library problems!
[06:24:38] <a|3x> you know, you are not really helping
[06:24:55] <Blondie101010> sorry you don't realize that I just found your problem which is on the system
[06:25:05] <Blondie101010> you're missing an important library!
[06:25:14] <a|3x> which library
[06:25:26] <a|3x> tbh, this is ovh hosting, not really my system
[06:26:01] <Blondie101010> something like linux-vdso.so, libc.so, or ld-linux-x86-64.so
[06:26:27] <Blondie101010> your system is broken
[06:26:35] <a|3x> hm..
[06:27:07] <a|3x> i'll have to look into it
[06:27:10] * Blondie101010 nods
[06:27:52] <a|3x> how can libc be missing, everything uses it
[06:27:57] <Blondie101010> hosting??
[06:28:04] <a|3x> wouldn't the system not boot if libc was missing?
[06:28:07] <Blondie101010> aw then it's due to the chroot
[06:28:16] <Blondie101010> maybe they did that intentionally, or by mistake
[06:28:25] <a|3x> could be a security measure
[06:28:37] <Blondie101010> not really security, but limiting for sure
[06:29:12] <Blondie101010> so that system is incompatible with what you're doing
[06:29:13] <a|3x> why does exec() work then?
[06:29:39] <Blondie101010> do you know what a chroot is?
[06:31:02] <Blondie101010> it changes what appears to be /, therefore anything that depends on regular / could be mapped improperly (for any reason)
[06:31:18] <a|3x> yes i know what chroot is
[06:31:26] <Blondie101010> in this case I found that a lib is not mapped, and in your case probably a matter of /proc
[06:32:10] <Blondie101010> ls -l /proc
[06:34:10] <a|3x> let me check
[06:35:28] <a|3x> ls -l /proc gives "Command unexpectedly terminated without error message"
[06:35:40] <a|3x> not sure why /proc would be important in this case
[06:35:52] <Blondie101010> see a broken OS, not made to run as a regular OS
[06:36:11] <Blondie101010> they don't support what you do
[06:38:10] <Blondie101010> a|3x:  where do you think proc_get_status() checks?
[06:38:24] <Blondie101010> somewhere under /proc/$pid/
[06:38:45] <a|3x> see but im able to get my stuff to work with 'useExec'
[06:38:55] <Blondie101010> I just told you why
[06:39:07] <a|3x> it doesn't need /proc?
[06:39:50] <Blondie101010> where are processes listed with their status, file descriptors, response, etc?
[06:39:53] <Blondie101010> I just said it!
[06:42:08] <a|3x> mkey
[06:42:34] <a|3x> thanks for the help
[06:42:39] <Blondie101010> np
[06:42:54] <Blondie101010> it was an intriguing case, and I didn't expect it
[06:46:46] <a|3x> what do you think of this '--enable-sigchild' thing?
[06:47:51] <a|3x> could it be another thing that would cause incorrect exitcode behavior?
[06:49:39] <__adrian> what "incorrect exit code"?
[06:49:50] <a|3x> -1
[06:49:53] <__adrian> are you talking about this?  https://github.com/mikehaertl/php-shellcommand/blob/1.6.4/src/Command.php#L424
[06:50:10] <a|3x> https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71804
[06:50:16] <__adrian> and did you read the manual as i suggested some time ago?  https://php.net/proc_get_status
[06:51:05] <__adrian> you would always get  -1  unless the process happens to have already exited on the first iteration
[06:51:17] <__adrian> that's expected behavior and described on the man page
[06:51:18] <a|3x> right
[06:51:36] <a|3x> but on this server im always getting -1
[06:51:57] <Blondie101010> yes, because of host system limitations
[06:52:37] <a|3x> my question would be, assuming there were no limitations with /proc, would it still not work due to the bug described here https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71804
[06:52:41] <__adrian> do you have a test case where you know that the process has already exited?
[06:53:17] <__adrian> a|3x: the "bug" described there is a documentation error. and it was marked fixed in 2016.
[06:53:52] <a|3x> i guess 'sleep 2' works, so that means it can work, but what if somebody sets up a SIGCHLD handler
[06:54:35] <a|3x> __adrian, ya, and...?
[06:54:49] <Blondie101010> then it will interact with the corresponding PHP build option
[06:55:29] <__adrian> ...and therefore, no, it won't do anything because of that bug, because that bug is *fixed, and also *wasn't a bug in the code in the first place
[06:55:55] <a|3x> i mean, the bug page describes something interesting
[06:56:19] <__adrian> without having dug too much into it, if someone compiled php with --enable-sigchild then i suppose you'd probably see the behavior
[06:57:03] <__adrian> not sure how relevant that is, though, since there are other factors in play here (your host, and your code)
[06:57:06] *** Joins: christianPHP (~christian@190.232.168.7)
[06:57:10] <a|3x> from what i understand, you will get -1 if you have that compile command option and that signal is caught by a signal handler set up by some other php code
[06:58:02] <__adrian> yes, that's what it sounds like. and that seems like it would make sense
[06:58:04] <a|3x> im writing code for a large number of users, i need to handle these cases
[06:58:39] <__adrian> then specify in your docs that you shouldn't use --enable-sigchild
[06:58:44] <Blondie101010> large number of users seems unrelated to how you run that command
[06:59:06] <__adrian> but yeah, won't fix the loop issue
[06:59:33] <a|3x> Blondie101010, i don't understand
[07:00:02] <Blondie101010> there's no valid reason for 99.99% of websites or web apps to catch signals
[07:00:14] <Blondie101010> even if you have billions of users
[07:00:18] <a|3x> see but this is wordpress we are talking about here
[07:00:23] <__adrian> heh
[07:00:41] <a|3x> who knows what plugins they have and what signals they are catching
[07:01:02] <__adrian> if the answer is not "you do" then i don't see why this would be an issue
[07:01:12] <Blondie101010> you choose the plugins you enable if I remember correctly
[07:01:28] <__adrian> you can't be responsible for everything a user does
[07:01:44] <__adrian> and i'm not saying that as an absolution, i mean it's literally not possible
[07:01:47] <a|3x> im not the one choosing though
[07:02:31] <a|3x> what i was going to do is detect lack of /proc and the SIGCHLD signal handler and do useExec for those cases
[07:02:52] <a|3x> but i see there are some difficulties doing the second thing
[07:03:40] <Blondie101010> it's not a big mix
[07:03:54] <Blondie101010> sigchld behaves as expected
[07:04:59] <Blondie101010> so basically 2 different concerns
[07:05:24] <a|3x> ok thanks for the help guys
[07:05:34] <Blondie101010> np
[07:08:27] <Blondie101010> if you could disable the sigchld, you'd get the exact same thing you got when you did: ls -l /proc
[07:09:27] <Blondie101010> echo $?
[07:09:43] <Blondie101010> that could give a hint
[07:10:58] <Blondie101010> is it -1?
[07:11:26] <a|3x> "echo $?" => "Command unexpectedly terminated without error message"
[07:11:45] <a|3x> but i didn't disable sigchild
[07:13:09] <Blondie101010> hold on
[07:13:13] <Blondie101010> do you have shell access?
[07:13:43] <a|3x> no i don't
[07:13:51] <Blondie101010> ahhh ok
[07:14:01] <a|3x> im running this from php files via web server
[07:14:29] <Blondie101010> shell_exec() could be useful for troubleshooting

[12:32:56] <hackwar> Hi, when running a CLI script, I get these errors: PHP Warning:  simplexml_load_file(): I/O warning : failed to load external entity "<Path>/language/en-GB/en-GB.xml" in <Path>\libraries\src\Language\LanguageHelper.php on line 672
[12:33:21] <hackwar> I get this for basically every time an XML file is loaded with simplexml_load_file()
[12:33:57] <hackwar> the path is correct. I have no idea where to start. PHP 7.4.22 on Windows 10
[12:50:52] <Naktibalda> you XML files has references to that language file
[12:51:37] <hackwar> that is the file that the code is trying to open.
[12:52:30] <Naktibalda> the check file and directory permissions
[12:52:59] <Naktibalda> try to file_get_contents() the same file and see if you get an easier to understand error
[12:53:02] <hackwar> it's windows. the script is run with the same user and all
[12:54:06] <biberu> hackwar: that path looks off, it's an absolute path
[12:54:57] *** Joins: cisco87 (~quassel@lnxg33k.com)
[12:55:02] <hackwar> yes, the path is absolute and I abbreviated it. As I said, I checked that the file exists and the path is correct.
[12:55:36] <biberu> so you have e.g. c:/languages/en-GB/..?
[12:56:30] <hackwar> no, I have D:\apachefriends\xampp\htdocs/language/en-GB/en-GB.xml
[12:57:31] *** Quits: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:58:35] <biberu> so that doesn't seem right, does it work if you 1) update it to the correct absolute path and then 2) adjust it to be relative instead?
[13:04:06] <hackwar> The thing is, that this is code from a widely used framework and it works perfectly fine in the web context.
[13:06:01] <Naktibalda> it isn't a code issue, it is a file issue.
[13:06:25] <hackwar> the exact same code with the exact same file works perfectly fine in the web context.
[13:06:43] <Naktibalda> XML error messages are often difficult to decrypt check if file is readable using is_readable function or try to open it
[13:07:26] <Naktibalda> we don't support Windows
[13:10:24] <biberu> hackwar: well, you didn't show any code, the xml, or even name the framework or web context (is that even using the same os?)
[13:16:58] <hackwar> it is on the same computer. No VMs or anything.
[13:17:02] <hackwar> the framework is Joomla

[14:42:27] <hackwar> I tried opening the file at the beginning of my script, exact same values and it works fine.
[14:45:52] <hackwar> ok, found the issue. A dependency was calling libxml_disable_entity_loader(true), which caused all of this.

[19:46:11] <HyP3r> While startup of the php-fastcgi engine some messages are written there
[19:46:14] <HyP3r> But not mine
[19:46:56] <HyP3r> Acutally my php is just error_log("foo", 0); phpinfo(); die();
[19:47:01] <HyP3r> But there is no logging in this file
[19:47:06] <HyP3r> I slowly getting crazy
[19:48:43] <HyP3r> if I do die(errorl_log("",0)); I can see a 1 which should be the "true" of the return value of error_log so the logging itself was prop. sucessfully

[19:53:27] <Naktibalda> terminalpusher: most likely in /var/www/html
[19:53:40] <terminalpusher> I already tried that but `echo 'a'` in it does nothing
[19:53:45] <terminalpusher> if I go to index.html/a.php
[19:53:51] <terminalpusher> and yes I put <?php ?>
[19:54:08] <terminalpusher> I.e. <?php echo 'a'?> but I had no output on the page
[19:55:31] <terminalpusher> Naktibalda do you know why that is? I called the file `a.php` and put it into /var/www/html and went into my browser to localhost/a.php but I can't see an "a" on the page
[19:57:32] <da_wunder> it should be `<php echo 'a'; ?>` note that `;` char there
[19:58:18] <terminalpusher> Here's my full content of a.php. Is this correct? https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/8635c68b05f64a23806079248a15a509
[19:58:22] <terminalpusher> I tried that too
[19:58:25] <terminalpusher> I see no output
[19:58:49] <da_wunder> ok, so what do you see?
[19:58:59] <da_wunder> and what is the url that you're using?
[19:59:20] <terminalpusher> localhost/a.php
[19:59:32] <terminalpusher> if I use your code (literally just that) it says "The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol." in the console

[19:59:57] <terminalpusher> If I use `<?php echo 'a'; ?>`
[20:01:24] <Naktibalda> terminalpusher: Look at View Source in firefox, do you see PHP code?  Ctrl+U
[20:01:39] <terminalpusher> yup. All it says on that page is `<?php echo 'a'?>`
[20:01:40] <terminalpusher> in red
[20:01:46] <Naktibalda> install php then
[20:01:51] <da_wunder> ^
[20:02:14] <terminalpusher> the weird thing is that it doesn't show the semicolon in CTRL+U

[22:20:11] <g0tcha> hey guys, quick question, i need to run a php script, the hosting does not allow running cron and the task planner gives errors when running it.. is there a place anyone can recommend that could run the php cronjob ?
[22:21:30] <TML> get a better hosting service? I mean, it's 2021 - there's absolutely no reason to use a garbage provider that doesn't allow you to run cron :grimace:
[22:21:41] <da_wunder> ^
[22:22:00] <TML> g0tcha: Failing that, you could use something like pingdom or statuscake or monit to query your page regularly
[22:22:01] <AllenJB> No idea what "the task planner" is - but what makes you think you won't get errors running the script via some other method?
[22:22:42] <g0tcha> AllenJB, nothing, i have to test
[22:22:47] <g0tcha> TML, ill check those out
[22:22:54] <da_wunder> and what is that actual error that you get from that 'task planner' ?
[22:23:15] <TML> yeah, I completely ignored this "task planner" bit because I have no context for what you're referring to
[22:24:44] <da_wunder> same here, no idea what that 'task planner' is - first time seen someone to mention that
[22:26:24] <g0tcha> the task planner actually runs
[22:26:30] <g0tcha> but the php script is what errors out
[22:26:52] <g0tcha> and osTicket support blames the task planner saying its not runnign correctly when its the script that errors out
[22:27:09] <g0tcha> on the other hand, running the script locally with php -f script.php works fine
[22:27:19] <da_wunder> g0tcha: so really, explain what that "the task planner" actually is AND what error you get from your php script when you're running that via that "the task planner"
[22:28:13] *** Joins: seand (~seand@69.54.142.196)
[22:28:42] <da_wunder> literally _never_ heard someone using term "the task planner" - so it's quite hard to guess what that is
[22:30:02] <TML> g0tcha: No one here knows what your "Task planner" thing is, so we can't really assist you with that
[22:30:44] <da_wunder> so what I would do to debug that - I would just create simple php script like `<?php echo "hello world";` and try to run that with that "the task planner" and see if that works
[22:31:37] <da_wunder> and if that works as expected - then your `script.php` contains something that "the task planner" doesn't allow to use - could be eg. exec function calls and so on
[22:32:28] <g0tcha> ok, so i use Infomaniak, a Swiss hosting company, it doesnt allow cronjob on shared hosting, so instead they give us access to something called "task planner" which lets us run php scripts
[22:32:45] <g0tcha> thats the task planner part, now let me explain about the error i get,
[22:33:19] <g0tcha> when i run the script locally like i said, it would work, the script's purpose is to fetch emails for new tickets and ticket replies for osTicket system
[22:33:21] <da_wunder> ok, so hosting specified "thing" - so most likely your `script.php` is trying to do something that they don't allow you to do
[22:33:46] <g0tcha> if i run it using the task planner, the task will run fine, but the script itself gives an error, let me paste it here, its a single line
[22:33:54] <da_wunder> and really you should contact that hosting support with this question
[22:33:59] <g0tcha> thats the error: cron.php only supports local cron calls - use http -&gt;
[22:34:45] <da_wunder> also try to understand that we _don't_ know what your `script.php` does - so this is quite big guessing game
[22:34:53] <g0tcha> no, the error is not from the task planner, its from the php script :p  thats why i was asking maybe if there are places that lets me run php scripts like cronjobs to test with

[22:35:43] <da_wunder> telling something !== actual code
[22:35:51] <g0tcha> here is the script https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/blob/develop/api/cron.php
[22:37:08] <da_wunder> hmm, earlier you mentioned `script.php` file that you're running - so is that the same file that you shared ?
[22:37:58] <g0tcha> oh i just called it script.php for the sake of the conversation
[22:39:43] <g0tcha> ..if that makes sense
[22:41:43] <da_wunder> I was looking that cron.php and there is literally multiple possible errors that could happen - so I really recommend you to contact that hosting provider and ask detailed logs from their side
[22:42:25] <da_wunder> you're paying for that hosting, so you should get support - if not - just change your hosting provider

[22:46:05] <g0tcha> thats the thing, i did, there are no errors from their side, the task does run, the error i get is from running the script itself, cron.php only supports local cron calls - use http -&gt; api/tasks/cron
[22:46:29] <g0tcha> if the script does not run by the task planner then i would not get that error
[22:48:06] <g0tcha> another test i did to make sure the task planner is running, is if you look at the code it says that api.inc.php is required
[22:48:26] <g0tcha> so i removed that file, ran the task planner and it gave an error complaining about api.inc.php missing
[22:49:41] <da_wunder> so then do old-fashion A-B-C debug and see what is happening - and with that I mean brutal `echo 'A';` and so on in that whole script

[22:50:44] <g0tcha> i have no idea what echo A mean hehehe
[22:51:28] <g0tcha> but like i said, its an issue with the script, not with the task planner like osticket ppl suggested?
[22:52:45] <da_wunder> g0tcha: A-B-C debug - you just "echo" something out that you can see - and then if you don't see all those echo's you know that something failed _before_ that
[22:53:42] <da_wunder> so literally something like `<?php echo "a"; doSomething(); echo "b"; ... echo "c"; ...`

[23:39:07] <g0tcha> no, thats it.. it asks where the script is located, asks how often to running it (minimum 15mins), asks to report if it runs or if there is an error and thats it
[23:39:20] <g0tcha> the task itself never reports an error
