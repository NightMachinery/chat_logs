[01:46:46] <Parf> through ambiguity, discovery can take place. through mistakes, we can progress. fear is the "mind killer", if only due to the fact that it restricts our foot from stepping forward
[01:51:30] <chronos> anyone know if there's a polisci pr poliphil channel
[01:52:27] <Parf> there's a ##politics at least
[01:52:54] <chronos> eh... i tend to avoid politics chats that are not philosophy oriented
[01:53:03] <chronos> People get a little too hot under the collar
[01:53:11] <chronos> thanks thoughj
[01:53:39] <voltage_> this could be a polisci or polihil channel
[01:54:10] <chronos> cool cool
[01:54:12] <audrey> ##politics is generally regarded as the gutter of the network
[01:54:18] <audrey> I wouldn´t recommend it for any kind of serious conversation.
[01:54:33] <chronos> audrey: yeah, not surprised
[01:54:54] <chronos> I'd rather find something that's about ideas rather than tRuMp baD cAnCeL cUltUrE
[01:56:54] <audrey> Hell, I´m an op in ##politics and I don´t even go in there, it´s that bad. :x
[01:57:01] <audrey> Yep.
[01:57:01] <chronos> ouchj
[01:57:17] <chronos> Anyone here into political philosophy?
[01:57:58] <chronos> audrey: it's a shame how places like that tend to get ruined, there's gotta be a way to talk about polisci and not make it about curent BS
[02:01:18] <audrey> Truly. :(
[02:02:36] <prahou> chronos: emma goldman and the likes.
[02:03:19] <chronos> prahou: you've been reading goldman?
[02:03:42] <chronos> read some of her stuff recently, I've got her Two Years in Russia book on my shelf as a to-read
[02:03:52] <prahou> chronos: disillusionment in russia
[02:04:02] <prahou> yeah that's the one
[02:04:15] <prahou> Alex Berkman is a good follow-up
[02:04:34] <chronos> interesting, I'll look them up
[02:04:42] <chronos> I also read some bakunin recently too
[02:04:46] <prahou> God and state?
[02:05:11] <chronos> Yeah, and something else in a collection of anarchist essays I've been reading though
[02:05:29] <prahou> Look for de Cleyre, to me she's the most accessible.
[02:05:39] <chronos> This winter I went down a rabbithole of techno-marxism, and now I'm going down an anarchist rabbithole
[02:06:19] <chronos> hm, my wife might like this author too
[02:06:25] <chronos> She's reading some Sady Plant right now
[02:07:17] <prahou> never enough women in philosophy
[02:08:09] <chronos> agreed, it's getting slightly better, but there's still a lot to go
[02:09:22] <chronos> prahou: have you taken a look at Urbanomic press before? They've got a lot of good stuff
[02:09:25] <chronos> Both old and new
[02:09:43] <prahou> no idea what that is, I'm looking it up now
[02:09:45] <chronos> #accelerate is a really good collection of essays, but it's a hard read if you're not a bug deleuze guy

[02:10:20] <chronos> big <=> bug. New keyboard is messing me up
[02:11:33] <prahou> Thanks! Looks like a great resource.
[02:11:59] <prahou> And no, I'm not a big Deleuze guy. Maybe 10 years ago.
[02:12:40] <chronos> Yeah, i've mostly got a passing knowledge of his ideas, but that one has a section that's got a lot of analysis based on his ideas
[02:12:59] <chronos> The first few chapters of the book though are all about machines, and were written in the 19th century
[02:13:48] <chronos> So it's really cool to see how people were thinking about mechanization before it was like it is now
[02:13:53] <prahou> I'm currently inching my way through Heidegger's view on language.
[02:14:29] <chronos> Ah nice, I picked up being and time the other day, havent gotten the will to read it yet though
[02:14:49] <chronos> I had a Wittgenstine phase a few years ago too. Read some of his later stuff
[02:15:44] <prahou> Tractato logico-philosophicus. I based my bachelor thesis on some of his ideas.
[02:16:30] <chronos> Oh cool, I read that, as well as Philosophical Investigations
[02:16:42] <chronos> The first was significantly shorter...
[02:17:31] <chronos> I take it you have some formal background in the field then?
[02:17:59] <prahou> But back to your machines.. Are you looking for some utopic ideals in anarchism and your interest in philosophy of mechanisation?
[02:18:38] <chronos> I'm mostly exploring actually, trying to see how people characterized the world around them in different times
[02:18:56] <chronos> And looking at the similarities with the world now
[02:19:36] <chronos> I started to dig into political philosophy recently because I wanted to try and understand where the curent landscape we have now came from
[02:19:50] <chronos> But I ended up going off into the weeds a little and found it more interesting anyway
[02:21:08] <chronos> where's your interest in anarchism from?
[02:22:13] <prahou> soviet blok citizenry and expansion on the ideals of classless society
[02:23:08] <prahou> know that my experience and research lead to nothing very optimistic. the older I got, the more right I swang.
[02:24:02] <chronos> I think that's a common transition. A lot of the utopian ideas that the left-leaning writers have come up with are really intersting, but have a back track record of implementation.
[02:24:18] <chronos> That said, definitely worth study and understanding, there's a lot of value to take a way from them.
[02:25:02] <prahou> I always remember Goldman in this case. Finally reaching the utopic new Russia, meeting with Lenin and going 'Wait, this is not what I expected.'
[02:25:40] <chronos> That's why she's so intersting, I want to take a look at her writings afterwards too and see how it impacted her thought

[03:44:50] <Samian> hello
[03:45:01] <Samian> I need to vent
[03:45:05] <Samian> I wish "if versus only if" was taught in school. I wish I learned the difference in elementary school
[03:45:18] <Samian> That's pretty foundational logic in my opinion.
[03:46:14] <Samian> In all things else in life, you build the foundation before building on top of it.
[03:46:22] <Samian> Foundations for buildings are constructed before the building.
[03:46:30] <Samian> Bottom layers of wedding cakes are made before upper layers
[03:46:41] <Samian> Basic addition and subtraction are taught before algebra and calculus.
[03:56:53] <Parf> thankfully there are many ways to skin a cat
[03:57:20] <Parf> there seem to be a great many who flourish without any "foundation", strangely
[03:57:35] <Parf> or at least a far more ambiguous one
[04:05:38] <Samian> What I see happen is people all the way to adult hood still confusing if and only if
[04:05:47] <Samian> still confusing sufficiency and necessity
[04:06:09] <Samian> More own 70 year old mom does it and makes herself look like a fool
[04:08:26] <Samian> Example: "Money doesn't buy happiness," mom says.  "Yes, it does. It's called hiring a psychologist and investing in your mental health," I say. "But there are many people making under 50k a year who are happy," my mom says.  "Sure, some people don't need help to be happy. But if you do need help, and you have money to afford it, you can buy the help!" I say.
[04:15:26] <Samian> *My own 70 year old mom
[04:17:38] <Parf> your mom sounds like a wise lady

[12:14:27] <Samian> Humans are so weird.
[12:14:51] <Samian> Humans are weird because I look around, see humans, and count how many of them are doing something that's either (1) them enjoying life; (2) them investing to enjoy life in the future.   (1) Enjoying life examples: enjoying the weather on a nice day.   (2) investing example:  learning a new skill like data science.
[12:15:14] <Samian> WHy do only so few humans spend their time enjoying life and investing to enjoy it in the future?  Instead, most humans keep their crap life crap, or they get sidetracked in fighting other humans
[12:15:28] <Samian> BY fighting other humans, I mean a cause like conservative v liberal; a physical fight; a neighbor who doesnt want to cut a tree with leaves falling on your yard, etc;  a former significant other who dumped you.

[18:52:06] <badsektor> hello philosophers
[19:00:18] <badsektor> i am in a particularly phlosophic mood
[19:00:20] <pulse> i'm more of a philophosphor
[19:01:09] <badsektor> today i am thinking about the difference between being public order and humanity oriented vs being self and fmaily oriented
[19:01:15] *** Joins: Nokaji_ (~Nokaji@user/nokaji)
[19:01:53] <badsektor> this distinction may parallel the distinction between being moral and being selfish or 'beyond good and evil'
[19:02:10] <badsektor> maybe it also corresnponds to the difference between being inauthentic and authentic in the existentialist sense

[19:03:23] <badsektor> so say if you feel moral outrages too often because of some anti-progressive incident then you are probably not living an authentic life but you have become an instrument for some ideology
[19:05:35] <badsektor> i am also thinking about how there might be parallels between pagan morality, satanist ethics and existentialism
[19:08:27] *** Nokaji_ is now known as Nokaji
[19:10:52] <pulse> seems like a sound argument
[19:12:25] <Nokaji> thanks
[19:18:22] <pulse> it's hard to be authentic in a culture that promote fakeness at every step

[19:27:06] <arryana> there's no shortage of authentic people.  but looking for them on social media is like trying to find eagles under a coral reef, it isn't their natural habitat.
[19:28:18] <fructose> arryana: Where are you finding all these authentic people?
[19:30:32] <voltage_> badsektor, i heard nietzsche wrote about being authentic
[19:31:12] <lalia> I certainly haven't had trouble finding authenticity IRL. :) Comedy and philosophy professionals are examples of folks who tend to avoid socializing online. I find both crowds to be very constructive and inviting. Wholesome crowds generally, IMO.
[19:31:44] <lalia> Also, good morning. o/
[19:31:51] <voltage_> what does it mean to be authentic though?
[19:32:07] <pulse> it means to be true to yourself and to others
[19:32:10] <pulse> to be earnest
[19:32:14] <fructose> lalia: Are you sure your view of authentic isn't just too broad?
[19:32:19] <lalia> Some would say the concept falls apart upon examination, TBH.
[19:32:30] <pulse> it's not a concept though
[19:32:40] <pulse> is sincerity a concept?
[19:32:53] <arryana> fructose, it's called 'the real world'
[19:32:59] <arryana> heya lalia
[19:33:01] <arryana> feeling better?
[19:33:05] <fructose> pulse: If you can name something, it's a concept.
[19:33:14] <lalia> Pretty sure, fructose. I also don't care very much because I'm not invested in the narrative. Authenticity seems like a snipe hunt to me.
[19:33:24] <pulse> fructose, i can name the universe. is the universe a concept?
[19:33:33] <pulse> i can name my dog too, is my dog a concept?
[19:33:48] <lalia> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe_hunt
[19:33:48] <ro-bot-o> [url] Snipe hunt - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[19:33:51] <fructose> arryana: Well you're clearly not authentic, so I guess I shouldn't take your advice on it anyway.
[19:33:56] <lalia> In case the snipe hunt reference is confusing.
[19:34:00] <pulse> a concept is something that exists in our heads, apart from reality
[19:34:06] <arryana> hahah
[19:34:19] * arryana pats fructose on the head and dismisses them utterly
[19:34:53] <fructose> Thanks for making it even more obvious to anyone who was confused
[19:35:24] <lalia> Yeah, I can't jive with personal language takes too well. Later Wittgenstein instructs me that all private notions of language are the result of socialization and interpersonal connection.
[19:35:37] <lalia> GG, ordinary language philosophy.
[19:35:40] <voltage_> lalia, i don't get it, so snipe hunt is a practical joke and so is searching for authenticity?
[19:35:47] <fructose> pulse: Yes, those are all concepts.
[19:36:09] <pulse> fructose, i disagree. my feeling is that a concept is a symbol for something in the real world, but it's not _the_ real world
[19:36:20] <pulse> therefore sincerity isn't a concept, it's a behavior
[19:36:36] <fructose> pulse: Okay, no one can stop you from having your own meaning for words
[19:36:38] <lalia> voltage_: what is confusing? There is not snipe... so the hunt is a farce. I'm not sure what's unclear.
[19:37:04] <pulse> fructose, actually the dictionary agrees with me too ;)
[19:37:12] <pulse> concept - noun - an abstract idea
[19:37:22] <fructose> pulse: Words are all abstract ideas
[19:37:32] <pulse> yes, but they point to the reality
[19:37:35] <pulse> which isn't an abstract idea
[19:37:35] <arryana> who determines the bar for 'authenticity'?
[19:37:40] <voltage_> lalia, ok so you mean that authenticity is not a thing, ok, that's what i wanted to know
[19:37:41] <pulse> if someone is authentic, that's not conceptual
[19:37:44] <pulse> they're actually authentic
[19:37:50] * pulse shrugs
[19:38:10] <fructose> pulse: You just used a word to describe it. Work on the logic portion a bit more
[19:38:25] <pulse> fructose, i've worked with logic every day for the past 20 years
[19:38:32] <pulse> i'm very familiar with logic
[19:38:39] <pulse> potentially far more than you are
[19:38:47] <pulse> but i think you don't really understand what i'm saying here
[19:38:49] <pulse> at all
[19:38:59] <pulse> you seem to confuse the map for the territory
[19:39:11] <fructose> I'd say you need some work if you've agreed that words are all abstract ideas and continue to argue that something with a name isn't an abstract idea
[19:39:32] <pulse> but it's true. if you hit your head the pain isn't an abstract notion
[19:39:42] <pulse> there's no book that will describe to you the feeling of pain
[19:39:45] <pulse> it's not a concept
[19:39:55] <lalia> I stopped caring about the conditions for authenticity when I did research comparing it to the concept of sincerity. Spoilers: they're near synonyms and neither are able to do much for communication outside of strict and explicity contextual mentions.
[19:39:59] <pulse> but you can conceptualize pain if you want, it's just not the real thing
[19:40:03] <lalia> I don't care much for these terms. :)
[19:40:10] <fructose> pulse: Pain is a concept, sorry
[19:40:15] <arryana> agreed, lalia
[19:40:23] <pulse> fructose, as long as we're talking about it, yes. if you actually feel pain, then no, it's not a concept
[19:40:30] <pulse> again i'm not sure you understand me here
[19:40:35] <pulse> judging by your responses i'd say you don't
[19:41:03] <fructose> pulse: I'm saying you're wrong. Everything that has a word is an abstract idea
[19:41:12] <lalia> Werd, I'm gonna check on my sick family and start breakfast. I shall do so inauthentically and insincerely.
[19:41:14] <fructose> That doesn't mean it's *only* an abstract idea
[19:41:16] <pulse> fructose, and that abstract idea is _not_ the thing it's describing
[19:41:18] <lalia> I'm sure it'll be fine anyways. :D
[19:41:20] <pulse> the word apple isn't an apple
[19:41:25] <pulse> and the word water can't quench your thirst
[19:41:27] <pulse> ever in a million years
[19:41:32] <pulse> the actual water isn't conceptual
[19:41:32] <pussipupu> good fortune to you and your family

[19:46:02] <lalia> Nice break. :)
[19:46:48] <arryana> excellent
[19:47:42] <fructose> pulse: The part where the signals in your CNS, like those generated by your cochlea when someone says words at you, or those in your eyes when you read text, ultimately are what produce abstract ideas in your brain
[19:48:00] <voltage_> fructose, what do you think it means to live authentically
[19:48:02] <pulse> fructose, that doesnt' disprove my point at all
[19:48:09] <pulse> fructose, there's nothing abstract about getting slapped in the face
[19:48:14] <pulse> it's very direct and straightforward
[19:48:34] <pulse> also if you want me to put it differently, here's my favorite example. do you think you can learn how to ride a bike by reading books on how to ride a bike?
[19:48:35] <fructose> voltage_: Without deception
[19:48:59] <pulse> reading books about riding a bike is the conceptual side and you will never be able to ride a bike that way
[19:49:07] <pulse> even if you spend 50 years reading techniques for bike-riding and memorizing them
[19:49:18] <pulse> that's the essential distinction between the conceptual and the non-conceptual
[19:49:18] <fructose> pulse: Getting slapped in the face is both a concept and an abstract idea. You've just proven it by talking about it.
[19:49:25] <pulse> fructose, no, it's not
[19:49:29] <pulse> you don't do philosophy when you feel pain
[19:49:35] <voltage_> fructose, do you include in that decieving yourself without realizing it?
[19:49:40] <fructose> No is also a concept, as is denial
[19:49:58] <pulse> fructose, well you're wrong on all of that but i'm out of time now to keep discussing it :p
[19:50:51] <fructose> voltage_: Possibly. If I'm also deceiving myself I might not recognize it though and still regard someone as authentic
[19:50:52] <voltage_> lalia, now that i think of it, do you think equality is also a snipe hunt?

[19:53:49] <lalia> Probably depends on the context... like without offering any additional constraints beyond merely suggesting "equality for all" or whatever, it definitely appears to be a quest for something unattainable.
[19:54:08] <lalia> voltage_: I'd have to develop the topic more tho to respond real thoughtfully, I'd guess tho.
[19:54:43] <lalia> A bit more delicate a discussion, IMO, and I'm multitasking family stuff already. :P
[19:54:51] <lalia> Good question tho, I think.

[19:58:54] <arryana> sorry, there's people here for coffee in the real world, a little slow to respond in text
[19:59:02] <lalia> <3
[19:59:19] <arryana> i'm bailing soon, so everyone's trying to get time in
[20:01:05] <pussipupu> Rings a bell but I can't quite place them

[20:03:01] <lalia> He was one of our OG reasoning people. Lovely cat. I remember him being an admin for wireless network architecture.
[20:03:37] <lalia> Which reminds me, I also hope xenolith is doing well.
[20:03:48] <lalia> I wasn't around when he split.
[20:03:59] <pussipupu> I'm probably just being slow, I do that

[20:11:18] <arryana> i hadn't chatted with him in a long time, but i don't imagine the apocalypse was good for his work
[20:11:45] <arryana> some stuff just didn't translate to online work well
[20:12:47] <pussipupu> I'm lucky we didn't have a lockdown, or I'd not have got my current job
[20:13:05] <arryana> oy
[20:13:19] <lalia> Right, that seems like a valid concern. He hasn't logged on in 24+ weeks, look at the old network.
[20:13:31] <arryana> my other half has had to do a few on site things actually installing equipment, but mostly he had no issue changing to remote work
[20:13:46] <arryana> and for me, video teaching isn't ideal, but it isn't impossible either
[20:13:55] <arryana> hm
[20:14:14] <lalia> I'm guessing he's regrouped and is focused on family stuff. Or he got serious about building custom puzzles. :D
[20:14:27] <lalia> His puzzle collection was legendary.
[20:14:35] <arryana> amazing.
[20:14:43] <arryana> and his woodworking awesome too
[20:14:50] <lalia> :)
[20:21:41] <arryana> i am seriously looking forward to setting up a workshop
[20:23:18] <arryana> though my stuff will in no way rival his

[23:22:34] <Beyondo> i tried to make the word lalia in Words with Friends, didn't work =/
[23:23:43] <lalia> You'd have to use a term like Glossolalia, and I'm not sure Words with Friends recognizes Greek or Latin imports.
[23:24:05] <lalia> -lalia works as a suffix in English mostly. The word is a transliteration from Greek.
[23:24:17] <Beyondo> ah, i knew of echolalia
[23:24:27] <lalia> Means speech or voice in Greek. :)
[23:24:41] <lalia> Yeah, echolalia's another real recognizable example.
