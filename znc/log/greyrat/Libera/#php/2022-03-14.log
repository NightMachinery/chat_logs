[03:29:15] <up_running> da_wunder: After reading about binding, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by binding here.
[03:29:21] <up_running> I think you are referring to binding the `$values_array` variable. Is that correct?
[03:29:48] <__adrian> up_running: in relation to sql?
[03:30:00] <up_running> And in case what I'm doing isn't very clear, here is a pic of the excel document
[03:30:01] <up_running> https://imgur.com/a/YmJBqTn
[03:30:05] <__adrian> https://php.net/pdo.prepared-statements
[03:30:28] <__adrian> !+pdo_mysql prepare
[03:30:28] <php-bot> How to prepare a statement using PDO: https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/1ddd71511e01c1f609db
[03:30:43] <up_running> __adrian: yes, in relation to sql.
[03:30:48] <up_running> it's about the code I shared yesterday
[03:30:54] <up_running> I'll post it again here:
[03:31:24] <up_running> https://gist.github.com/random-jaylen/6854a27a6e0bf367752f99c3c22e0db8?permalink_comment_id=4096205
[03:32:00] <__adrian> https://gist.github.com/random-jaylen/6854a27a6e0bf367752f99c3c22e0db8?permalink_comment_id=4096205#file-sampleb-php-L43  ← yeah, this.
[03:32:03] <up_running> I think da_wunder was referring to line 43 when he recommended that I read about and implement bindings
[03:32:07] <__adrian> DO NOT put $variables into your sql.
[03:32:17] <__adrian> use prepared statements and pass data via :paramters.
[03:32:33] <up_running> ok, let me take a look at your links
[03:33:02] <up_running> the explanations that I've read in about six links on bindings are not clear, so far
[03:33:40] <__adrian> ok. so, do you understand with the problem is with putting variables in your sql?
[03:34:07] <up_running> the risk of sql injection
[03:34:48] <__adrian> basically, yes. whether as an attck or simply a mistake.
[03:34:55] <__adrian> do you undedrstand what "sql injection" is?
[03:34:57] <up_running> I don't understand the technical details of *why* that causes a sql injection or even what a sql injection is in relation to this code, but I understand this risk from the readings I've done thus far
[03:35:03] <__adrian> k
[03:35:10] <__adrian> so, here's what sqli is
[03:35:38] <__adrian> when you write sql, there's two parts. the _instructions_, and the _data_.
[03:36:03] <up_running> and to be clear, i know i can read up on this areas I don't understand, but I'm trying to not go down any rabbit holes until I can solve this immediate problem first
[03:36:06] <__adrian> the instructions are what you want the code to do. insert, select, delete, etc., and with which tables/columns, and so forth.
[03:36:23] <__adrian> no, this is extremely important - if you don't understand it, you will not solve it
[03:36:32] <up_running> ah, ok.
[03:36:38] <__adrian> the data is the information that you want to put in the database.
[03:36:49] <up_running> i can stop and read up on it to save you some typing
[03:36:53] <up_running> if this is that important
[03:37:00] <__adrian> i'll be quick
[03:37:27] <__adrian> take this as an example:   "INSERT INTO a VALUES($x,$y,$z)"
[03:37:30] <up_running> you can take your time, i just didn't want to waste your typing on things that I can potentially google myself
[03:37:55] <__adrian> here's the problem: whatever is in those $variables is now _part of_ the sql. it's not separate.
[03:38:30] <__adrian> if it's like you expect - maybe, $x=1, $y=2, $z=3 - it won't _seem_ to be a problem.
[03:39:02] <__adrian> but you don't know that it will always be what you expect. some $variables might have data that looks like sql commands.
[03:39:32] <__adrian> sql injection is _confusion_. the commands and the data are all in one place and the DB doesn't know for sure what you meant.
[03:39:56] <__adrian> prepared statements and parameters solve this by NEVER putting the commands and the data together.
[03:39:58] <up_running> ah, so if those variables are a part of the sql. debugging can be a big pain
[03:40:13] <__adrian> prepare() sends the commands to the database, WITH NO DATA.
[03:40:27] <__adrian> execute() sends the data to the database, WITH NO COMMANDS.
[03:40:48] <__adrian> there is no longer any opportunity for the two to be confused, because they are literally never in the same place.
[03:41:17] <up_running> ok, I think I see your point now.
[03:42:07] <__adrian> so:   ->prepare("INSERT INTO t VALUES(:x,:y,:z)")  // no data
[03:42:20] <__adrian> and then  ->execute([1,2,3])  // no sql
[03:43:13] <__adrian> heh. new analogy: coke and mentos. don't put them together!
[03:43:55] <__adrian> i usually show this: https://lockmedown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/data_command_thumb-376x400.jpg
[03:44:44] <__adrian> follow?
[03:45:03] <up_running> It's a bit more clear now.
[03:45:09] <up_running> I'm reading the links you posted above
[03:45:19] <__adrian> kk
[03:45:31] <__adrian> when you're done, consider: !+php first
[03:45:31] <php-bot> when you're done, consider, your PHP code can be sorted into two categories: code which _performs work_ (processing input, controller logic, database access, error handling, etc.), and code which  _produces output_ (header(), echo, <?= $var ?>, plain ol' <html>, etc.). work goes FIRST. output goes LAST. https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/9ed2542a695e2ebe30aa
[03:47:07] <up_running> before I forget, I was thinking about our discussion regarding how my internship should have a senior developer extremely excited to work with me all the time.
[03:47:11] <__adrian> and then:  https://php.net/foreach  - for() is not usually the right kind of loop. when you're iterating arrays, use foreach().
[03:47:14] <up_running> I think you're absolutely correct
[03:47:46] <__adrian> well, it would be nice if they were happy about it  :)  but mainly i meant they should be paying a ton of attention to you
[03:48:01] <up_running> but this is a federally funded program; where i'm interning at did not want any interns
[03:48:15] <up_running> but since they are receiving money to host me, then they obliged
[03:48:39] <up_running> so, I can't be too picky and I must realize that i'm lucky to just get some professional experience
[03:49:22] <up_running> it took the program manager almost a year to find someone willing to take our cohort even though we have thousands of federal dollars to burn
[03:49:52] <up_running> but anyway, i'll get back to reading the links now. i just wanted to mention that since I was pondering it a lot yesterday
[03:53:17] <__adrian> "up_running> so, I can't be too picky and I must realize that i'm lucky ..."  this is actually the thing i was getting at - no, don't sit back and let employers abuse you. don't buy into that as though that's how it is and is supposed to be
[03:54:10] <__adrian> there are lots of abusive employers, yes. but that doesn't mean you are a piece of poop.

[05:32:21] <__adrian> "either got stolen, misplaced or broke"  uhh  you don't know which?

[05:35:07] <__adrian> k, i'll take that as a "no" also. that's not even a git question, much less a php question.
[05:35:20] <__adrian> sorry, but we've got nothin to offer there.
[05:35:41] <__adrian> except, next time, make sure your backups are good.
[05:35:44] <jargon> The website doesn't have a .git, I am talking about two differnet things at the same time.

[07:08:20] <up_running> but as long as things work properly, anything is fine, I suppose

[07:14:09] <up_running> ah, ok

[07:14:45] *** Joins: funhouse (~funhouse@user/funhouse)
[07:14:53] <up_running> well, let me also share with you the method where I'm interning at uses
[07:15:02] <__adrian> do you really have a column in your table named  "app_*"  ?
[07:15:13] <up_running> I couldn't figure it out when I was reading up about it
[07:15:47] <up_running> __adrian: yes, that is a column name
[07:16:02] <up_running> it is shown in the imgur pic I shared earlier
[07:16:06] <up_running> were you able to view it?
[07:16:15] <Rockwood> for($row=0;$row<=$lastRow;$row++){ you can make more easier
[07:16:26] <Rockwood> by just foreach
[07:16:40] <__adrian> didn't look. did you choose that name or was it already there
[07:16:43] <up_running> here is the pic again, just in case you missed it:
[07:16:44] <up_running> https://imgur.com/a/YmJBqTn
[07:17:18] <up_running> this excel file is given to us and it is long (hundreds of lines)
[07:17:39] <up_running> i am supposed to input this into a database
[07:18:16] <up_running> and then enable anyone who needs the data to be able to click or utilize the database to autopopulate pdf forms and memos
[07:18:40] <DavidSaylor41040> i can leave my id field out of my insert queries right? it'll still work as intended?
[07:18:40] <up_running> there are some curveballs though:
[07:19:16] <up_running> #1 the Maint Control Number will change every time we receive the file
[07:19:33] <__adrian> DavidSaylor41040: depends on how your table was made
[07:19:36] <up_running> ^ I think this is the primary key I will use for ordering the database
[07:19:46] <__adrian> up_running: slow down
[07:19:57] <__adrian> look at my question
[07:20:04] <DavidSaylor41040> just an ordinary auto-increment id int(6) field
[07:20:16] <up_running> #2 we will also add three columns to the database from our in-office space
[07:20:17] <__adrian> "int(6)" isn't ordinary  :p
[07:20:28] <__adrian> but yes, if it's autoinc it's not required
[07:20:39] <up_running> __adrian: ok, let me scroll up and check it
[07:20:46] <DavidSaylor41040> why what's the normal int size?
[07:21:19] <DavidSaylor41040> i use to use 5 but that was like 20+ years ago
[07:21:27] <__adrian> up_running: "__adrian> did you choose that name or was it already there"
[07:21:43] <up_running> __adrian: to answer your question, yes, all the names are pulled directly from the Excel file
[07:21:57] <__adrian> DavidSaylor41040:  column_name SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
[07:22:05] <up_running> but it doesn't have to stay that way
[07:22:23] <__adrian> "serial" means "bigint unsigned not null"

[07:22:33] <DavidSaylor41040> oh well yeah i thought you meant 6 for my int size was not normal
[07:22:41] <__adrian> it's definitely not
[07:22:51] <up_running> __adrian: I was actually told to come up with some other potential names that make sense, but I assumed that would complicate things regarding syncing the data
[07:23:02] <__adrian> you should not put a display size on your PK
[07:23:21] <__adrian> up_running: renaming is less problematic. stick with simple characters in your db tables.
[07:23:31] <__adrian> basically alphanumeric and underscore
[07:24:07] <up_running> If the column name is "App *" and then I rename it to something else, I'll have another issue to sync the data from that column, no?
[07:24:31] <__adrian> you can make a mapping
[07:25:07] <up_running> hmm, ok, i'll have to read up on that then
[07:25:14] <__adrian> e.g.,  const EXCEL_FIELD_TO_DB_COLUMN = ["app_*" => "app_star", etc...];
[07:25:37] <up_running> ahh, ok. looks like that would work!

[07:26:27] <__adrian> this would use the mapped value if it exists, and the original field name if not
[07:26:43] <__adrian> (so you only need map names that need changed)

[07:29:12] <up_running> __adrian: are you doing away with the `$values_array` variable?
[07:29:50] <__adrian> not necessarily, just limiting the scope of the example.
[07:30:01] <__adrian> "however" you get the data, is the point.
[07:30:49] <__adrian> i don't use phpoffice, but i'd strongly suspect there's a method for getting all the columns in a given row.
[07:31:01] <__adrian> and probably a method for getting all the rows in a file.
[07:31:56] <__adrian> so you might be able to  foreach ($excel->getRows() as $row) { $insert->execute($row->getColumns()); }

[11:09:29] <netstar> as in, you can follow the logic
[11:10:01] <mlu> what I've perosnally found is that SQL is SQL -- main difference is how you wrap/abstract the code
[11:10:23] <mlu> looks just as awkward outside of PHP too

[11:17:09] <mlu> the reason why: if your code has any business logic, you're gonna be coding up the business logic anyways, and if your stuff is simple enough to not need the business logic, you might as well use a spreadsheet

[12:39:19] <TinoDidriksen> netstar, sometimes you get data in where you don't quite know the type, such as from SQL or GET/POST. So you don't care if it's '42' or 42, just that it is == 42. It is naturally better to ensure the type first via intval() or similar, though.

[15:09:41] <Zizzo-> if i serialize() something in php 8.1 i can't use it in php 7.4?
[15:10:10] <Zizzo-> can't find any incompatible changes in the release notes though..
[15:11:08] <Naktibalda> try it and see, though it is generally recommended to avoid using serialize()
[15:11:31] <mlu> Zizzo-: quick readthrough indicates that the formats are the same, but you really should avoid it :P
[15:11:45] <mlu> choose a more common data interchange format if you can
[15:12:20] <Zizzo-> yeah, trying to upgrade in prod but ran into this
[15:12:38] <mlu> :(
[15:12:54] <Zizzo-> well, i suppose just changing the cache keys would help
[15:13:10] <mlu> json_encode / json_decode yo
[15:14:28] <Zizzo-> hmm, in 8.1 I added __(un)serialize and doing that in 7.4 makes it work... hmmm
[15:14:41] <Zizzo-> don't really understand why though
[15:15:08] <mlu> what exactly are you trying to do?
[15:15:16] <mlu> are you upgrading from 7.4 to 8.1? downgrading?
[15:15:25] <Zizzo-> upgrading yea
[15:16:17] <mlu> probably some objects changed their serialization methods
[15:16:39] <Zizzo-> so there are objects in memcache that have been serialized with serialize(). and now in 8.1  there's also __serialize because it was deprecated for the next version

[16:06:27] <__adrian> Zizzo-: php serialization is not (never was) a storage or transfer format. very very strongly recommend not using it as such. the implementation is not guaranteed to remain the same.
[16:07:04] <Zizzo-> yeah, totally agree. dealing with some huge legacy stuff here
[16:07:16] <__adrian> this might shed some light on what changed, btw: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phase_out_serializable

[16:22:36] <__adrian> it's the interface `Serializable` and its methods serialize() and unserialize() that are deprecated. __serialize() and __unserialize() are still supported, as are the _functions_ [un]serialize() and the old magic method __sleep()/__wakeup().
[16:36:29] <Blondie101010> I wonder if the new approach allows object references in the serialization...

[19:55:30] <Stanley> Whats the best way to generate PDF's in PHP? I've tried DOMPDF in the past but I've always had a bunch of trouble with it, I need to create pretty specific layouts with element positioned around the page and such
[19:56:10] <Stanley> In the end I just ended up creating a separate HTML page that pulls up and auto triggers the print dialogue and I've instructed them to change it to "Save as PDF" if they want to save it
[19:56:24] <Stanley> which is... hacky.. but I would like to have a proper solution so they can download it properly
[19:56:30] <TML> There's no great answer, but if you need precise layouts, you should probably be looking at pdflib

[20:04:45] <Naktibalda> $foo->bar()->a()
[20:06:24] <tsukasadt> Yeah, same call path but for a non-static. Is it possible? I know I can do subclasses, but it's not quite the same.

[22:55:32] <__adrian> seems like you already have these arrays in your code. as mentioned, use var_export()
[22:55:59] <NakedKing> __adrian, i use var_export at there https://3v4l.org/oYKg4
[22:56:56] <__adrian> that's not valid php code
[22:56:59] <da_wunder> NakedKing: note the difference between print_r and var_dump - https://3v4l.org/A9ghD vs https://3v4l.org/UDdGu
[22:57:26] <__adrian> see da_wunder's 3v4l
[22:57:36] <da_wunder> NakedKing: with 3v4l.org please provide "working" code
[22:57:44] <__adrian> (the earlier one, aZfFO)
[23:00:07] <hans> da_wunder: fwiw 3v4l supports regex replace, replacing ^array with $a[]=array  and ^\) with ); makes it valid at least (did that in my 3v4l above)
[23:00:08] <NakedKing> i cant. I cant assign my var_export() return to a variable. https://3v4l.org/JqgIE
[23:00:46] <da_wunder> NakedKing: so just modify that code to be valid one... should not be so hard
[23:01:47] <__adrian> https://php.net/var_export  ← see $return
[23:02:04] <__adrian> the docs are very friendly, read them
[23:02:10] <da_wunder> hans: don't know about that feature - but your example didn't use the original input either - but imho that is not the issue here - fixing that is trivial and literally doable like seconds...
[23:04:48] <da_wunder> in that - 21:25 < NakedKing> __adrian, i use var_export at there https://3v4l.org/oYKg4 - the shared input _is not_ valid PHP, so I'm assuming that NakedKing is doing that var_export inside foreach loop
[23:05:12] <da_wunder> but now sauna, back in ~1 hour ->
[23:05:22] <NakedKing> yes da_wunder.
[23:05:32] <__adrian> yes, rather than exporting the entire list of arrays.
[23:06:14] <__adrian> but, assuming da_wunder's example is correct, now focus on the $expected results. show us what you want to end up with.

[23:34:25] <NakedKing> Forgive me, i cant understand well.   https://3v4l.org/sA89M   this is my code.  With print_r($key) the result is: 01201001200000001012301000000012301201234567890123456789101112   this makes me sick, how can the arrays have same keys? how can i make a process based on the key like this return?
[23:35:15] *** Joins: agrosant (~agrosant@46.12.50.59.dsl.dyn.forthnet.gr)
[23:35:38] <__adrian> so, your example earlier was a list of arrays. are they not arrays? or is this a different question?
[23:36:30] <__adrian> as for keys: is that one key?
[23:36:53] <NakedKing> same question. i stucked there.  $avaibleTransfers returns an weirdo array which i send here
[23:37:34] <NakedKing> nope. lots of array here which i tried to send here unsuccessfuly
[23:37:58] <__adrian> do  $transfers = var_export($monero->listIncomingTransfers('available', $account['account_index'])['transfers']);  and put that in a 3v4l.

[23:38:54] <__adrian> and again, the point of 3v4l is _working examples_. that means you use $example data, not just an except of your code that doesn't work in isolation.

[23:42:43] <NakedKing> Dear __adrian please dont get angry to me. I couldnt assign it again.  With your wish: $transfers = var_export($monero->listIncomingTransfers('available', $account['account_index'])['transfers']); return: https://3v4l.org/99RVo    and within pre tags (cropped last array for get bigfile error): https://3v4l.org/3fFTC

[23:47:09] <__adrian> i'm going to take the first half of that: https://3v4l.org/IbWDm
[23:47:20] <NakedKing> I got $account['account_index'] from a loop
[23:48:03] <__adrian> for your example, only look at one of them.
[23:48:17] <NakedKing> uhmm sure
[23:48:48] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/FCeB0  ← here. show me the array you want in the end.
[23:48:58] <Sammitch> `$monero->listIncomingTransfers('available', $account['account_index'])['transfers']` returns a numerically-indexed array, and `foreach(.... as $key => $value) {}` gives you those farily meaningless numbers as `$key`, hence your previous result

[23:52:34] <__adrian> ^
[23:52:46] <__adrian> this should be plenty for a working example
[23:52:47] <da_wunder> should not be so hard - really

[23:54:28] <da_wunder> and literally that is what we've asked you for more than hour, giving you some examples that we think is "right", but it seems like those are not - so we _really_ need proper input from _you_ now
[23:55:37] <NakedKing> I felt like I was mentally retarded. What is expected array at there? The array result is not clear like that in foreach. I just want to operate in the array, collect the amount, fire an event and send a notification to the user.
[23:55:37] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/LCbSe  e.g., does this $expected describe what you want the result to be?
[23:55:57] <__adrian> the $expected result is *the result you want*.
[23:56:07] <__adrian> *what do you want to end up with?*
[23:56:31] *** Quits: ianthrive (~ianthrive@2603:3026:56d:e100:1535:eb2:8824:c04) (Client Quit)
[23:56:35] <__adrian> e.g., if you want to add 5 and 6, your $expected result is 11
[23:56:44] <Albright> Or are you not trying to transform the data and we misunderstood that part?
[23:56:49] <__adrian> and you can then use that to test whether the code you write is correct
[23:57:39] <NakedKing> Example: if $transfers[x]['subaddr_index']['major'] equals to $transfers[y]['subaddr_index']['major']. sum their ['amount']
[23:58:58] <da_wunder> NakedKing: so is this output what you want - 21:20 < da_wunder> NakedKing: eg. something like - https://3v4l.org/UDdGu ?
[23:59:09] <Albright> So you want to a) group transactions by ['subaddr_index']['major'] and then b) calculate the sum of the ['amount'] values for each group?
