[00:51:01] <B0g4r7> omg, systemd hosed me again.
[00:51:24] <B0g4r7> Two of my USB hard drives disconnected and reconnected for no apparent reason.
[00:51:54] <B0g4r7> Systemd decided it needed to intervene, and stopped nfs-kernel-server.
[00:52:28] <thyriaen> Howdy, i recently switched to be using my laptop as a desktop replacement and it is basically stationary, plugged in and running the entire day :: is there a way i can set it up such that it does not constantly charge and discharge the battery but instead leave it as is and just use the power from the plug to run it ?
[00:52:38] <entuland> B0g4r7, it may be a power surge
[00:52:49] <B0g4r7> That brought my chia harvester to a halt right at the moment when it was eligible to farm a block, and by the time I restarted nfs-kernel-server, it was too late and the 30 second window was past.
[00:53:03] <B0g4r7> 6 plots were eligible for farming 4e6745e0df... Found 1 proofs. Time: 81.55186 s.
[00:53:37] <entuland> all of my USB devices disconnect and reconnect every time my heating water circulation pump goes on or off (some kind of weird interference on the power lines)
[00:53:38] <B0g4r7> So I missed out on 2 XCH, $830 thanks to systemd.
[00:53:46] <B0g4r7> I hate you, systemd.
[00:54:22] <B0g4r7> If it had just minded its business and not intervened, those two drives could have been offline and the rest of the system would have kept moving along.

[06:48:10] <coreyhuinker> yeah, that was my fear as well, hence hoping that there was a way to cherry-pick packages from the repo. I suppose I could browse the repo and manually download it...

[13:13:06] <MTecknology> The installer offers the option to set up lvm on top of a luks volume in one of the "default" setups, but looking at the manual disk setup, I don't see LVM listed anywhere in the "Use as:" list. Everything else... but not lvm. :/

[17:07:56] <varaindemian56> tomreyn yea
[17:09:03] <tomreyn> it's not a problem to switch from nouveau to nvidia and back to nouveau again. but reverting all the static configurations the nvidia driver makes may be involved.
[17:10:30] <tomreyn> i.e. you'll need to undo the nouveau module blacklisting and the xorg.conf configurations

[20:41:11] <tomreyn> varaindemian56: on irc and irl, karma is both subjective and automatically added to and substracted from your account when you interact with the surroundings, or fail to do so. thanks for the offer, though. note: your system now consumes more power (saves less). (i suspect this is a result of a model specific mainboard firmware bug.) there is a chance that a future version update of the linux-firmware package (which includes the intel audio
[20:41:12] <tomreyn> chipset firmware) would fix / work around this.
[20:43:02] <tomreyn> varaindemian56: if you want to play sound through a hdmi or diplaylink adapter you may need to switch to the other sound card (included in the dedicated graphics card).

[23:31:43] <Nokaji> Hi, I'm having issues with bluetooth. from what I can tell it works intermittently but only once after a reboot. It's a fairly new laptop and I've upgraded to 21.04 - I'm reading it could be due to upgrade or 'secure boot' being active
