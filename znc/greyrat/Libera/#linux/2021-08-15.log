[01:22:21] <neshpion> i don't really like rust but i will take it over C++.  C is king daddy language but rust has actual strings and iterables
[01:22:57] <neshpion> if i need to design a native program i will reach for C, then rust, then C++
[01:23:03] <enkeyz> The big problem with all these old programming languages the toolchain imo
[01:23:06] <enkeyz> biggest*
[01:23:17] <neshpion> yeah the rust toolchain is pretty neat compared to C/C++
[01:23:28] <Sauvin> It's ludicrous to believe that any particular language would remain the de facto language for development at the metal level forever.
[01:23:39] <neshpion> C will never die!
[01:23:45] <enkeyz> both Go and Rust's toolchain is neat compared to C or C++
[01:23:49] * neshpion gargles vitamin C
[01:23:51] <Sauvin> C may never die, but it could very easil be overtaken.
[01:23:54] <Sauvin> *easily
[01:24:15] <pasiz> c++ is only extension to c
[01:24:30] <neshpion> no, it is no longer a superset of C
[01:24:48] <enkeyz> I really like that you don't have to create makefiles, download libraries manually, or messing around with test libraries - because it's already in the toolchain
[01:24:53] <Sauvin> I don't think C++ has ever been a strict superset of C.
[01:24:53] <hodapp> C++ has not been a C superset in decades.
[01:24:58] <neshpion> C-style C++ can make invalid C and vice-versa.  don't ask me for examples because i don't have any :D
[01:25:39] <hodapp> it happens to interface well with C, but there's still a reason that C programmers don't just use a C++ toolchain for everything, then only write C
[01:27:06] <neshpion> C++ was the first contender attempting to dethrone C, rust is the second contender
[01:28:42] <enkeyz> Rust came closer in the last 2 years, than C++ could in 20 years :D
[01:29:29] <neshpion> rust's development learned a lot from history
[01:29:36] <enkeyz> guys like Stroustrup don't understand what makes people tick these days
[01:29:45] <enkeyz> same with Java
[01:29:49] * kfrench starts ticking.

[03:00:08] <kfrench> ghostbuster: What it means is, the init process will start a different set of programs depending on the run level.  "single user mode" is just one of those run levels.

[05:57:52] <AndrewYu> Rant about how GNU/Linux is: It seems that even "minimalist" distritubions like arch that I'm using now is not minimalist at all---We use that silly kernel where most hardware works out-of-the-box. This would be a good thing for average users, but for those who really like tinkering around with their computer, this sucks, becuase we have a load of extra modules that we never use. I'd think that the
[05:57:54] <AndrewYu> basis of some users' (including me) computing philosophy is "not to have a bunch of code in your computer that's unrelated to your computer or that you will never use". I hope that there's a way out---What do you guys think is? Gentoo? Or even BSD? I think Linux From Scratch sounds like it, but I don't know how I'm going to get something like a package manager on it. What I prefer is something that
[05:57:56] <AndrewYu> downloads a tarball / clones a repository based on the "repo name", but leaving things like configure, build and stuff to the user. Suckless software, for example, would probably benefit from that. Mentioning suckless, I hope that package manager should also support grabbing patches for that particular program.
[05:58:22] <knotMez> AndrewYu you can custom configure a kernel with just what you need
[05:58:29] <AndrewYu> knotMez: Yes, true
[05:59:01] <AndrewYu> knotMez: Well the `base' package in arch already contains a lot of stuff... I'm attempting to figure out what in there that the system never needs

[07:49:53] <neshpion> jochum: i'm not clear on what you mean by overprovisioning being a bad thing though
[07:49:53] <Psi-Jack> It's Sparse.
[07:49:57] <jochum> yes
[07:49:57] <rascul> yep, sparse
[07:50:03] <FuriousGeorge> how is it thin provisioning though?  that seems to be what it's doing
[07:50:04] <rascul> sparse files are real files
[07:50:17] <rascul> but they space ls shows it takes might not be real
[07:50:22] <rascul> s/they/the/
[07:50:22] <FuriousGeorge> if it's so real, why does du not count the empty space (or at least some of it)
[07:50:23] <jochum> Didn't remember the spars thing ... its just 4TB zeros
[07:50:29] <FuriousGeorge> s/du/df
[07:50:30] <jochum> not
[07:50:46] <rascul> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file
[07:50:47] <Psi-Jack> FuriousGeorge: Because it's not yet consumed it up to it's maximum defined allocation.
[07:51:12] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: if you want a 4TB File you have to use dd
[07:51:13] <FuriousGeorge> Psi-Jack:  how does df know that about the zfs filesystem within the file?
[07:51:26] <FuriousGeorge> jochum:  first you gotta wait
[07:51:40] *** Joins: HolyGarbage (~HolyGarba@c83-254-160-78.bredband.tele2.se)
[07:51:48] <rascul> it's allocated but not claimed
[07:51:55] <FuriousGeorge> well, 2nd you gotta wait, first use dd
[07:51:55] <rascul> or something like that
[07:51:58] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: I don't like to wait, mate :P
[07:52:10] <FuriousGeorge> fallocate's for mates who don't like to wait
[07:52:16] <Psi-Jack> FuriousGeorge: I don't care or support the zfs filesystem.
[07:52:23] <rascul> it's reported as taking up 4TB but it doesn't actually take 4TB
[07:52:40] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: theres a #zfsonlinux channel but I'll happily help you here
[07:52:45] <FuriousGeorge> Psi-Jack:  i think other fs would behave similar
[07:52:58] <Psi-Jack> It would, but zfs specifically is when I stop.
[07:53:16] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: so you created a ZFS pool in that sparse?
[07:53:21] <FuriousGeorge> the fact that zfs is in the files isn't really germane
[07:53:29] <rascul> not german, either
[07:53:34] <FuriousGeorge> or that it's a file based zfs pool, i should say
[07:53:54] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: once you made a pool the kernel knows about the pool
[07:54:08] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: after reboot its gone
[07:54:35] <FuriousGeorge> jochum:  i don' tthink it makes a difference if it is a zfs pool or an xfs partition in the file, though i haven't tested
[07:54:44] <FuriousGeorge> i was just surprised that ls sees the file using 4tb
[07:54:54] <FuriousGeorge> while df shows it using 2.3tb
[07:54:55] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: better to compare ZFS with LVM than with XFs
[07:55:07] <rascul> it's because of what i tried to explain
[07:55:09] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: please switch to #zfsonlinux :)
[07:55:20] <rascul> and what i provided a wikipedia link to explain better than i could
[07:55:35] <FuriousGeorge> jochum:  im not comparing, just using xfs as an example of something that is unlike zfs, but would presumably behave the same way
[07:55:36] <jochum> I have a mice here :)
[07:55:59] <FuriousGeorge> since it is not as if df knows anything about any file system or volume management system
[07:55:59] <jochum> Hope it won't bite my cables
[07:56:23] * rascul bites jochum's cables
[07:56:29] <jochum> rascul: hahahahaahaha
[07:56:53] <rascul> biting power cables is how i brush my teeth
[07:57:12] <jochum> rascul: and power up your heart ? :)
[07:57:18] <rascul> yes, of course
[07:57:37] <Shenka> i do the same,  but you gotta make sure it’s plugged in for maximum use
[07:57:52] <rascul> indeed

[08:00:31] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: well fallocate is first byte + last byte
[08:00:39] <jochum> maybe bit

[08:09:45] <kurahaupo> FuriousGeorge: Of course it doesn't. That's why you don't usually use --apparent-size
[08:10:34] <FuriousGeorge> what i mean by the difference not corresponding is that the file is shown about 50% of its size, while only about 40% is in use
[08:11:42] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: please ask in #zfsonlinux, maybe those guys know more
[08:12:01] <FuriousGeorge> my theory, just guessing, is that it is a result of me having deleted something off the file-based volume, which does not return that space to zeroes, like it was with a new disk
[08:12:11] <Psi-Jack> jochum: He's literally already been told several times over anyway.
[08:12:14] <kurahaupo> FuriousGeorge: The space needed to store a file includes not just the content blocks but also any indirect extent blocks. And they're allocated in 4KiB or larger chunks even just to hold 1 byte
[08:12:16] <Psi-Jack> He just doesn't listen.
[08:12:16] <FuriousGeorge> jochum:  i just confirmed it doesn't matter what or if any fs on the partition
[08:12:48] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: they tested theier ZFS a lot in loops thats why I'm asking you to do so.
[08:13:38] <jochum> FuriousGeorge: but i like kurahaupo 's answer
[08:13:39] <FuriousGeorge> kurahaupo:  i don't think it accounts for this discrepancy, but i could be wrong
[08:13:57] <kurahaupo> And for a snapshot-capable filesystem, the extra blocks to track revisions need to be added

[08:15:21] <CompanionCube> FuriousGeorge: https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSZeroBlockDiscarding probably relevant :p
[08:15:23] <FuriousGeorge> ok, so maybe it does account for the discrepancy.
[08:15:44] <kurahaupo> I'm not 100% clear on zfs, but for btrfs all the metadata, including the inode, counts as allocated space for the file
[08:16:25] <kurahaupo> Whereas for ext*fs the inodes are "in their own space" and don't count as allocated blocks
[08:17:52] <kurahaupo> It would be hard to make a snapshot-capable filesystem that used the ext*fs approach, since it needs to snapshot the metadata, not just the content
[08:19:27] <FuriousGeorge> hard disks are low-level formatted before sale...  not necessarily all zeroes though.  i wonder if that is the reason i see difference versus jochum
[08:19:54] <FuriousGeorge> kurahaupo:  that's interesting

[09:48:46] <loganlee> like 192, 168, 4, 5
[09:49:27] <jim> loganlee, the octets are integers, yes, each 8 bit. so, 0 - 255
[09:49:57] <bpmedley> Perhaps more specifically.  As you know, 192 represents bits 32 - 24.  So, converting to an integer requires proper scaling.  I think scaling is the right word.
[09:51:59] <loganlee> bpmedley: if difference is >=0 what does it mean?

[11:48:52] <andai> hmm, let me rephrase. how do i get the other machine to boot?
[11:49:06] <ayecee> that depends on why it doesn't boot
[11:49:19] <andai> my instinct is to just get rid of the uuid and change it back to /dev/sda1 but that makes me wonder what was the point of the uuid in the first place
[11:49:45] <ayecee> that's a weird instinct
[11:50:24] <jochum> andai: you can replace INIT with /bin/bash in grub, do digg around
[11:50:27] <ayecee> but i guess i can understand it. when something you don't understand breaks, and you don't know how to fix it, it's tempting to just go back to the old thing you do understand

[14:34:15] <TJ-> TheSilentLink: usually you can make a loopdev of it and mount one of the partitions from the image. E.g. "sudo losetup --find --show --partscan nextcloudpi.img" then if it used for example /dev/loop3 you'd check for partitions with "ls /dev/loop3*" and mount one of those. E.g. "sudo mount /dev/loop3p2 /mnt/target"
[14:38:02] <TheSilentLink> hmm running sudo losetup --find --show --partscan nextcloudpi.img makes it show up in nautilus and then if I click on raspiroot it mounts! Thanks

[20:01:03] <autopsy> ZedHedTed, ls hangs because the inode table is FULL.

[20:02:29] <ZedHedTed> rascul: nice! your first suggestion made it spit them out in 10 seconds.
[20:02:32] <autopsy> ls -U dobnt mean nothing --no-color or --colo9red or otherwise

[20:03:21] <autopsy> Its a song. Thanks.
[20:03:25] <rascul> ZedHedTed the -U prevents sorting and --color=none helps to prevent a stat on each file, but also i should have specified \ls instead of ls so it doesn't do any aliases that might have other options but it appears as if it was ok in this case
[20:04:03] <jochum> rascul: maybe you also know howto paginate ls?

[23:34:20] <ayecee> i.e. what happens when you try. the error message is the programmer's way of saying why it didn't work.
