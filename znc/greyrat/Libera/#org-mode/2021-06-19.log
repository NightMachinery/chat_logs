[10:57:03] <rdrg109> I never thought extending Org Mode by defining your own header arguments was easy. Long story short: I like experimenting with LaTeX so I've created ob-latex-doc.el for creating minimal working examples, so that when pressing C-c C-c on a code block, the document at point is compiled.
[10:58:31] <rdrg109> Here's a minimal working example: http://0x0.st/-9Mj.org and here's the source code of ob-latex-doc.el: http://0x0.st/-9Me.el
[11:00:21] <rdrg109> It is not intended to be a package yet since it cover a small set of use cases, but I'm just sharing it to let know how easy is to create your own ob-{{language}}.el. In addition to that, if any of you have a suggestion, I would be glad to read them
