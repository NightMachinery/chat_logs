[14:12:28] <gerikson> oh yeah

[14:49:50] <river> i cant belive there is this whole anti-cancel-culture movement

[14:50:12] <river> "horrible people should be able to be abusive with completely impunity"
[14:51:05] <river> and it's always about random micro-celebs.. why do they care so much about these people that are more often than not, grifters
[14:54:13] <edk> cancel culture does have false positives
[14:54:54] <edk> i think wanting some kind of due process to be involved before destroying someone's public life is a respectable position
[14:55:16] <river> I see what you mean
[14:55:36] <river> but there's no *crime* being commited
[14:59:36] <edk> not in all cases, but it's still a pretty extreme thing to happen to someone
[15:00:34] <edk> which might be ok if they actually are horrible but i think it's generally applied in an unfair way

[17:01:45] <gwozniak> I' take very few notes in lectures
[17:02:46] <river> im a sieve so i take down everything i dont want to lose
[17:03:59] <gwozniak> I think I took very few notes because I always read the material to go along with the lecture
[17:05:00] <gwozniak> I was talking to some profs who have either retired or will be retiring soon and they have noticed a marked change in how students take notes over the years
[17:05:42] <gwozniak> They also say there has been consistent demand for more access to the lecture material over the years, now to the point where the lectures are recorded and anyone can view them anytime
[17:06:25] <gwozniak> But they don't think it has made much of a difference in terms of understanding by the students
[17:07:32] <gwozniak> They admit it could be them and how they lecture, but it's consistent with their colleagues so it seems not entirely attributable to that
[17:08:40] <gwozniak> One of the running theories is that students say they want to have access to learn on their own time, but they don't end up actually doing it
[17:09:01] <gwozniak> Which seems pretty plausible to me
[17:09:27] <gwozniak> Could also be attributable to a larger student population
[17:10:17] <gwozniak> One thing is certain: it's an awful lot of work to put together a recorded lecture if you are doing more than just recording a lecture in a room
[17:15:55] <river> im making winning moves

[19:21:07] <companion_cube> imode: is forth really like a bytecode format? I thought it was its own thing
[19:21:25] <imode> eh, it was more of a fun poke.
[19:21:33] <imode> forth is bytecode-ish.
[19:22:23] <companion_cube> will probably end up doing my own thing
[19:22:41] <companion_cube> but with things like "get a local frame with 5 slots" where slots act like local registers, by index
[19:22:46] <companion_cube> cheaper than local dictionaries
[19:23:27] <imode> the internal structure of the virtual machine is based around the concept of one huge dictionary that contains entries that can point to either compiled code or other entries.
[19:23:36] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/2k6no6xdtdj81.jpg
[19:23:49] <companion_cube> yeah that might be a bit too‚Ä¶ embedded for me
[19:23:49] <imode> a forth "word"'s representation internally is just, effectively, a series of addresses.
[19:24:02] <companion_cube> anyway, the whole idea is that stack languages are easy to implement, right? :)
[19:24:19] <imode> sure are, easy to codegen for too.
[19:24:39] <imode> imo I think you'd like the dictionary stuff.
[19:24:48] <imode> it's trivial to implement and bootstraps nicely.
[19:25:59] <companion_cube> I do want a toplevel dictionary for definitions, but most things should live in the heap
[19:26:10] <companion_cube> I still want like dynamic arrays and stuff
[19:26:12] <imode> "I wanna define a word" "cool, let's loop through your definition and grab all of the addresses of each of the words that make up your definition, and compile all of that into a dictionary entry"
[19:26:22] <companion_cube> ah yes, sure.
[19:26:27] <companion_cube> early binding.
[19:26:34] <imode> yeah and you can do late as well.
[19:26:45] <companion_cube> I'd rather do early, it's also generally faster
[19:26:56] <imode> forth's got dynamic arrays too. and heap allocation. the dictionary is effectively the heap.
[19:27:38] <imode> http://www.retroforth.org/
[19:27:40] <buttsbot> :retro forth ;
[19:28:50] <imode> this is a neat and tiny implementation backed by a single C file.
[19:29:39] <companion_cube> combinators and anonymous functions, hmm

[19:30:26] <companion_cube> oh there's a epub handbook, nice

[20:19:52] <ngoldbaum> a little surprising that amazon doesn‚Äôt have a slack competitor they try to shill
[20:20:03] <imode> we have chime.
[20:20:08] <imode> which is what we used to use prior to slack.
[20:20:16] <imode> and then the peasant revolt happened and we swapped to slack
[20:20:41] <ngoldbaum> yeah their heart isn‚Äôt into fighting against salesforce i guess
[20:21:11] <manicennui> We used HipChat before, which was bought by Slack.
[20:21:30] <manicennui> When I first started here I think we still had XMPP servers.
[20:21:41] <companion_cube> it'd be hilarious if amazon used IRC internally
[20:21:48] <imode> we half-do.
[20:21:51] <imode> it's there.
[20:22:01] <manicennui> I know Mozilla did when my friend worked there.
[20:23:18] <ngoldbaum> mozilla switched to discord a while ago
[20:23:28] <manicennui> I remember now. The company used XMPP when I first joined and SE used Slack as well. Then the company decided that they wanted to get everyone on the same system and moved us all to HipChat because it was cheaper.

[21:24:42] <gwozniak> If we all had all the data out there and ran the services ourselves with giant network connections directly peer-to-peer, all our problems would go away
[21:25:00] <gwozniak> Easy peasy
[21:27:38] <prussian> so true.
[21:28:48] <prussian> that getrandom() story made me laugh. does that mean reading from /dev/urandom will be like 85 times faster? I'm getting like 150MiB/sec from it now.
[21:29:02] <prussian> 85 times that would be, pretty fast.
[21:29:22] <gwozniak> surely would be noticable
[21:29:48] <prussian> I could crap fill my memory in like 3 seconds if true.
[21:30:12] <prussian> also means my crappy "urandom" script would need to be retired.

[21:34:03] <indigo> > When ARP monitoring is used, bonding slaves will send out ARP requests without a VLAN tag, even if an IP address is set on a VLAN interface in the same subnet as the arp-ip-targets
[21:34:22] <indigo> Someone needs to bring Mikrotik into the 2020s
[21:34:27] <cb> talking to gnu zealots can be frustrating
[21:34:29] <indigo> "bonding slaves"
[21:36:03] <drakonis> cb: what happened now
[21:36:12] <ngoldbaum> jordi being jordi
[21:36:21] <drakonis> oh
[21:36:23] <drakonis> okay
[21:36:37] <cb> i have funny jordi stories which actually aren't gnu related but they're for another day
[21:36:55] <ngoldbaum> he‚Äôs
[21:36:58] <ngoldbaum> not so bad
[21:46:37] <ngoldbaum> lol ok actually trying to read the eula then complaining about it is a little sus
[21:46:44] <gwozniak> I mean...
[21:46:58] <gwozniak> Have you used software in the last 10 years?
[21:52:36] <indigo> Jordi is pretty outspoken :)
[21:53:43] <Xe> i don't bother reading those licenses anymore
[21:54:40] <cb> if they become a problem for me i have biggger problems
[21:57:49] <kline> i dont mind jordi being outspoken
[21:57:57] <kline> but this is being deliberately helpless
[21:58:14] <kline> its nothing more than a tantrum because he didnt get the license in his preferred format
[22:07:10] <river> i cant stand him
[22:07:35] <river> he starts really stupid fights
[22:08:19] <gwozniak> kline: yup, deliberately helpless is exactly right
[22:14:38] <Xe> GNU+helpless?
[22:16:04] <gwozniak> Thinking that dispute resolution is a thing the world doesn't need, apparently

[23:11:19] <manicennui> We don't need it. Just do what I want.
[23:11:25] <manicennui> When in doubt, refer to what I want.
[23:13:07] <manicennui> Recently YT has been recommending videos of scenes from Mad Men to me.
[23:13:28] <manicennui> Watching them now, I realize that I was a bit mesmerized with Don Draper when I watched the show.
[23:13:39] <manicennui> And they come across very different now.
[23:13:54] <manicennui> Not that I ever thought the people on the show were good and ethical or whatever.

[23:38:05] <epilys> I don't think about Don Draper at all
[23:39:00] <manicennui> heh
[23:39:20] <manicennui> I think he is hilarious. I don't see him as a role model or anything.
[23:39:31] <manicennui> But also, he is clearly an incredible ass.
[23:39:58] <manicennui> But seems to really care about his kids sometimes.
