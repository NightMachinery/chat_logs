[00:20:32] <drakonis> i feel like diving deep into a pit of madness
[00:20:37] <drakonis> its called raku
[00:38:57] <Church> drakonis: I'm doing something similar, called making hardtack
[00:38:59] <Church> Yum
[00:42:05] <drakonis> lol
[00:42:08] <drakonis> hardtack huh
[00:42:33] <drakonis> are you preparing for the end of the world?
[00:43:15] <Xe> Church: to do the Mara snippets
[00:51:19] <Church> Ah that makes sense, kk
[00:51:34] <Church> Was wondering if there was something wonky about the default formatter
[00:55:52] <kronk> drakonis: all played by 28 year old neckbeards.
[00:56:10] <drakonis> lol
[00:56:11] <Church> drakonis: Possibly.
[00:56:12] <drakonis> yeah.

[00:57:42] <kronk> hah.
[00:57:47] <Church> Just saw the tasting history one on hellfire stew. Looks tasty
[00:57:52] <Church> But I like bland food
[00:58:16] <kronk> why?

[13:18:39] <river> > I would like to point out insulting someones work by calling it a NIH clone is actually harmful to the Zig communities reputation, your reputation, lobste.rs as a whole, the greater programming community, the planet earth, the galaxy and in fact our entire universe.
[13:19:43] <river> > Hare does not, and will not, support any proprietary operating systems.
[13:19:45] <river> lol
[13:19:50] <river> doesnt work on certain platforms as a feature
[13:20:48] <gerikson> ok so if someone takes the finished Hare code, and ports it to Windows... it's haram?
[13:20:52] <gerikson> how would that work
[13:21:00] <gerikson> unless the license is really weird
[13:21:09] <river> youll probably just get abusive emails
[13:21:24] <river> its not illegal but Do. Not. Port. Hare. PERIOD.
[13:21:55] <gerikson> LOL
[13:38:09] <gerikson> tempted to reply, instead I will spread it far and wide
[14:16:01] <gerikson> ``I know what the Grothendieck construction is, of course.'' - statements of the utterly deranged
[14:28:24] <jmiven> what surprised me about Hare is the CC NoDerivatives license of its specs
[14:30:45] <jmiven> I guess that confirms that I don't understand Drew's philosophical framework
[15:10:20] <river> what sources do you find good for reading about the ukraine war?
[15:11:50] <pja> river: difficult, as there’s a ton of disinfo + fog of war right now.
[15:18:24] <epilys> river, I agree with pja, we mainly have a west propagandized PoV and a pure russian propaganda PoV. I mainly read the guardian and try to always keep in mind we only get updates from what the Ukrainian gov and NATO publishes
[15:20:11] <epilys> The uncertainty is too big with some of the ongoing narratives e.g. that Russia's army is disorganised, in bad state, etc. We don't have the complete info yet. I believe them to be probably true and hope they are though.
[15:23:48] <gerikson> I read propaganda but I don't repeat it
[15:28:33] <epilys> I only know I know nothing
[15:31:01] <river> i mostly watch sky news on youtube
[15:55:22] <river> my current thinking is that putin does not particulary care about ukraine beyond it's applicability to escalate
[15:55:53] <river> if he just wanted to capture ukraine he could do this more effectively with military assets he is holding back
[16:04:43] <gwozniak> ``Hare does not, and will not, support any proprietary operating systems.''
[16:04:45] <gwozniak> LOL
[16:04:54] <gwozniak> That is one of the goofiest statements I've ever heard

[17:32:23] <companion_cube> cb: it's because there's a bunch of links to the comments above
[17:32:28] <companion_cube> so I'm curious :p
[17:32:52] <cb> companion_cube: here's what happened, make up your own mind, don't spread drama and shit https://i.imgur.com/MZSHOdo.png
[17:33:14] <companion_cube> heh, I've learnt to not interact with ddevault, but thanks :
[17:33:16] <companion_cube> :)
[17:33:17] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: ac being particularly indignant at the idea of sharing drew’s public site, then later speculating they’d add generics to hare (lol)
[17:33:52] <companion_cube> lol yeah
[17:33:58] <companion_cube> I mean I'm not that far
[17:34:02] <companion_cube> but just the first reply is gold
[17:34:15] <companion_cube> does calvin even use zig?
[17:34:18] <cb> i don't
[17:34:25] <cb> but i do note that drew was banned from zig
[17:34:37] <companion_cube> from many places, it seems
[17:34:39] <river> almost a pattern is forming
[17:34:48] <river> i really like andrew he seems decent
[17:34:57] <river> and i think he is doing great work on zig
[17:35:24] <cb> i dont like some of zig's decisions but i dont have any issues with andrewrk
[17:35:30] <river> it's not something I would use...
[17:36:07] <companion_cube> I can't wait for ddevault to rant when generics come to Go, real soon now
[17:36:22] <river> im so over the fuckin generics stuff
[17:36:31] <gerikson> hasn't he already ranted about that ?
[17:36:33] <river> for like 10 years
[17:37:04] <companion_cube> gerikson: I think he has
[17:37:12] <companion_cube> but it'll probably reiter a lot
[17:37:21] <companion_cube> river: you're right, it's time to rant about sum types now
[17:37:34] <cb> as much as i dont like rob pike i think russ cox is fairly reasonable
[17:38:11] <river> russ cox has that wonderful page about regex
[17:39:19] <companion_cube> yeah they did an ok design in the end
[17:40:24] <companion_cube> oh no is ddevault working on a kernel?!?!?

[17:40:27] <buttsbot> Why am I building a programming language in private?
[17:43:05] <gerikson> not so private after all
[17:43:21] <companion_cube> my god this cracks me up
[17:43:42] <companion_cube> he wants JSON, crypto, SQL adapters, image functions, etc. in his stdlib
[17:43:44] <companion_cube> but no hashmap
[17:43:49] <companion_cube> because that'd be GENERICS
[17:43:51] <companion_cube> 😂
[17:43:54] <gerikson> lol
[17:44:06] <companion_cube> that's just :chef kiss:
[17:46:00] <gerikson> ``This post was not a marketing stunt. It was a heartfelt appeal to your better nature.''
[17:46:19] <gerikson> Welcome to the internet. You must be new here.
[17:46:21] <gwozniak> sigh
[17:46:35] <gwozniak> I mean, fine, do what you want
[17:46:37] <companion_cube> he's more used to being on the other end of the bullying
[17:46:42] <gwozniak> But goddamn what a bunch of whining
[17:46:58] <river> jblow also building programming language
[17:47:05] <river> it seems like a really good way to be a cult leader
[17:47:11] <gwozniak> Yeah
[17:47:12] <river> messiah complex
[17:47:14] <river> i will save programming
[17:48:46] <gwozniak> The thought that it's the programming language here that's the problem they are trying would be rather funny if so many people didn't believe it
[17:49:07] <cb> i think there are too many PLs and nerds discussing PLs
[17:49:18] <cb> like, there are other critical things too: OSes, DBs, etc.
[17:49:25] <cb> why does PLT suck the air out of the room?
[17:49:38] <companion_cube> because everything builds on top of it maybe?
[17:49:38] <ngoldbaum> plus, C exists so let’s just use that forever
[17:49:39] <gwozniak> Because there is some mathematical purity to it
[17:49:53] <gwozniak> C needs to be retired in a big way
[17:50:04] <Brekkjern> Because you seem smart if you know a couple terms about PLT
[17:50:15] <ngoldbaum> building a programming language is something that feels like it could be tractable by a single person working really hard
[17:50:22] <ngoldbaum> an OS or a DB less so, maybe?
[17:50:35] <companion_cube> and yet serenityOS and sqlite exist :D
[17:50:42] <gwozniak> Even though it basically can't be because a good PL is actually the runtime for an OS
[17:50:43] <companion_cube> but it's a lot of work in all 3 cases
[17:52:05] <river> "there are other critical things too: OSes, DBs, etc." <-- yes !!
[17:52:12] <gwozniak> And at this point a good PL needs an awful lot of tools around it to be useful
[17:52:22] <river> there was this idea that the right language would solve every problem
[17:52:38] <river> and people started to come up with crazy programming languages like prolog
[17:53:25] <river> i think its been experimented with enough that we kind of know roughly what programming languages are suitable for tasks, and that there is no magic bullet language that will make everything trivial
[17:53:33] <gwozniak> Yeah, the key problem is thinking that a PL will make programming easier and safer across the board
[17:54:20] <companion_cube> but the negation of that is not "PL doesn't matter"
[17:54:33] <companion_cube> no silver bullet, but also not "all languages are equal"
[17:54:43] <gwozniak> At this point I don't see any PL in the last long while really making a difference to development practices
[17:56:36] <gwozniak> Things have shifted around a bit and are generally better with more functional programming stuff, mind you
[17:56:36] <buttsbot> 'Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's closures!' - https://wiki.c2.com/?ClosuresAndObjectsAreEquivalent
[17:57:54] <gwozniak> And I'd prefer to see Rust used in the embedded world, but it seems pretty clear that Rust is a lot more complicated to write than C in many cases
[17:58:18] <river> I think rust will make embedded MUCH easier
[17:58:37] <river> (for nontrivial stuff)
[17:59:55] <gwozniak> I doubt it will simplify development.  I'm sure it will prevent some nasty things from happening, but those nasty things tend to happen much later, so convincing people to give up the (feigned) simplicity early is a hard sell
[18:00:41] <river> fixing segfaults is a big part of dev no? :P
[18:00:45] <river> maybe i just suck
[18:00:58] <Brekkjern> We all do
[18:01:05] <gwozniak> Segfaults don't actually happen that often, from what I've seen
[18:01:29] <gwozniak> It's stray pointers and overflowed stacks, and poor use of interrupts
[18:01:42] <Brekkjern> I think a lot of those kinds of errors were more common when people tried to write "smart" code
[18:01:45] <companion_cube> what do you mean by "stray pointers"?
[18:01:48] <gwozniak> You don't get segfaults when there is no OS
[18:02:01] <gwozniak> companion_cube: pointers that point to the wrong data
[18:02:49] <companion_cube> heh
[18:03:03] <companion_cube> I think people would include that in "segfault" in the general sense
[18:03:05] <gwozniak> If you're lucky, you'll get a hardware fault and it will jump to a handler to help you debug it
[18:03:12] <companion_cube> as in, fucking with pointers and getting it wrong
[18:03:31] <gwozniak> Yeah, but 0x0 is a legal address on many devices
[18:03:44] <gwozniak> And there's nothing to stop you from using it
[18:04:36] <gwozniak> The vast majority of bugs I see are misunderstanding of what C actually says you can do, and bad management of interrupt code
[18:04:57] <gwozniak> Granted, those are the bugs that make it to me
[18:05:19] <gwozniak> I don't know what happens at the support level above me
[18:05:33] <epilys> it's memory unsafety all the way up
[18:06:27] <gwozniak> Keep in mind that malloc() is basically not used in the projects I see, and there is almost no manual memory management
[18:07:12] <epilys> static only?
[18:07:17] <gwozniak> Pretty much
[18:07:42] <gwozniak> If there is a heap, it will be small and used for a specific purpose
[18:08:48] <epilys> well in the higher (still low?) level manual memory management is still going on
[18:09:00] <gwozniak> Basically all the projects that make their way to me are just a while (1) {...} loop processing interrupt requests, moviing data from I/O memory to something else
[18:09:01] <epilys> here's a good post by my past gsoc mentor and qemu developer http://blog.vmsplice.net/2020/08/why-qemu-should-move-from-c-to-rust.html
[18:09:01] <buttsbot> Stefan Hajnoczi: Why QEMU should move from C to Rust
[18:09:57] <epilys> QEMU is C, has objects and classes, async IO, trampolines, callbacks, routines, it's hell
[18:10:00] <gwozniak> epilys: the only memory management that happens on a lot of the code here is stack management.

[19:15:26] <companion_cube> gwozniak: not to nitpick, but rust is very good at handling stack memory management too
[19:17:03] <gwozniak> companion_cube: I'm sure it is.  It's just that customers are using too much stack or making too many function calls.  If Rust uses more than C, they will get turned off by that, regardless of the othere benefits
[19:17:22] <companion_cube> oh ok
[19:17:24] <gwozniak> Really "use" is what I meant by "management"
[19:17:39] <companion_cube> no use after return, stuff like that? :)

[21:27:27] <companion_cube> instead, ask for their startup, "datagode"
[21:27:54] <wrl> i love how "funroll" has just become a word in itself
[21:38:30] <epilys> is 24-hour availability a skill you can improve upon?
[21:39:11] <gwozniak> Maybe it's per week
[21:44:12] <kronk> epilys: yes, become a time wizard.
[21:44:56] <kronk> Church: sweet jesus never tell this to any other amazon employee, you'll give management ideas.
[21:45:24] <kronk> "here billy, you're mandated to wear this buttplug when you're on-call."
[21:45:35] <companion_cube> epilys: yes, when moving to winter time
[21:45:38] <kronk> "it has a moisture sensor and a camera."
[21:46:04] <kronk> "side note, we're moving to 3FA. the third factor is a scan of your rectum."
[21:46:17] <companion_cube> all rectums are unique and unforgeable, don't forget
[21:46:24] <kronk> can I sell mine as an NFT.
[21:46:32] <companion_cube> non fungible tushy?
[21:46:47] <kronk> pornhub's new investment vehicle.
[21:52:38] <skyl4rk> Computational natural language processing and analysis is difficult because of all the edge[ing] cases, for example in the context of wearing buttplugs, what is designated as subject and object could be considered switched around, I wonder how lojban deals with this.
