[00:25:03] <dextaa> hi
[00:27:19] <jle> geirha: det var da voldsomt til tilfeldighet da :p kan jeg pm deg kort angaaende et loenns-/jobbtilbudsspoersmaal? 
[00:28:22] <geirha> ja, ok
[00:30:11] <dextaa> I have this log file with lines like "H.M.S X-coord Y-coord Z-coord" (tab seperated) and I want to convert the first column into seconds and keep the rest. So far I have awk -F. '{ print ($1 * 3600) + ($2 * 60) + $3}' but I want to just copy the rest of the line while keeping it tab seperated. How do I do it?
[00:31:49] <nmz> dextaa, convert first column into second, so chop off the first column?
[00:31:52] <nmz> or
[00:32:07] <dextaa> keep the first column but have it converted to seconds
[00:32:08] <nmz> do you want to add a new column
[00:32:43] <nmz> so get rid of all the rest, only 2 columns?
[00:32:54] <geirha> awk -F '\t' -v OFS='\t' '{ split($1, time, /\./); $1 = time[1] * 3600 + time[2] * 60 + time[3]; print }'
[00:33:04] <dextaa> sry if not clear
[00:33:07] <dextaa> I want to keep all the columns
[00:33:16] <dextaa> but the problem is the time in H.M.S
[00:33:19] <nmz> geirha's smaht
[00:33:20] <dextaa> i need it in seconds
[00:33:43] <nmz> i still don't get the problem
[00:34:09] <dextaa> geirha's works
[00:34:25] <dextaa> thanks
[00:36:40] *** Joins: besnn (~besnn@user/besnn)
[00:40:08] <geirha> nmz: my interpretation was that the first column contain duration in format <hours>.<minutes>.<seconds>, and they wanted to convert it to duration in seconds instaead, without modifying the remaining columns
