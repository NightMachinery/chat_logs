[00:30:03] <greycat> I haven't tried it.  I believe it comes from OpenBSD.
[00:31:06] <PMT> the original doas does.
[00:31:11] <PMT> opendoas is entirely novel code afaik.
[00:31:23] <tesseract> doas and sudo's security is about physical possesion of computer?

[00:32:44] <tesseract> their security is more like related with physical security?

[06:37:15] <tabb> yes, and i got the solution: need to go into  window --> Fonts --> Fonts Used for ordinary text. change the default font from server:fixed
[06:37:55] <tabb> but, i need to do it each time i open it
[06:38:07] <willow> file a bug report
[06:39:15] <willow> e.g. install reportbug and run 'reportbug putty'
[06:43:18] <somiaj> as an alternative you can use ssh. I don't see any bug reports about that, have you configured your system to use a non-standard font?
[06:45:35] <ectospasm> There are much better terminal emulators than PuTTY on Linux.  I only use PuTTY at work because it's the best I'm aware of on Windows.

[06:46:31] <somiaj> I like it better than putty, and it supports Xforwarding and sftp so you don't need an additional client for that
[06:46:33] <ectospasm> somiaj:  Most of the machines I use PuTTY on aren't under my control.  Some of my customers don't even allow PuTTY, and their alternatives are godawful.

[06:47:51] <somiaj> Unsure there, it is quite a bit more complicated than putty, though I think it is runable from its own directory
[06:48:25] <somiaj> I dno't recall using an installer wtih it. I use windows so rarely I don't care to much, but I find mobaxterm better than putty, though it isn't foss so maybe that will discourage some users
[06:48:34] <ectospasm> somiaj: I'd need to be able to run it without installing it, which is my definition of "portable" on Windows.

[06:50:26] <ectospasm> I have one customer that explicitly disallows PuTTY and WinSCP.  Before the contract ended I was able to trick my VDI into running PuTTY, but they canceled that VDI and my new one doesn't let me trick it.
[06:50:45] <ectospasm> Their alternative is godawful and slow, Tectia from ssh.com.
[06:51:07] <somiaj> yea, putty is nice that you can run it without installing. But it does appear that I did install it, so yea guess it won't work for that case

[06:53:26] <maxtim> I was thinking about installing debian on a vm, configuring it as I will need, and then convert that drive to an img and DD that to a 16g usb stick. That way I can boot into the usb stick on some old machine. Is that a good idea?
[06:54:24] <somiaj> maxtim: old machine? So you mean usb2? It is going to be very slow using a hd over usb2
[06:54:29] <willow> maxtim: or you could install Debian Live to a USB key and enable persistence
[06:54:34] <somiaj> it is better to use a live image in that case than to run with the usb drive as /

[06:55:52] <somiaj> yea, I wouldn't suggest running debian off a usb device on that machine, use a live image instaed
[06:55:56] <rk4> i ran debian off an SD card for a year or so
[06:56:06] <rk4> was kind of surprised the thing didn't hit some write limit

[06:58:37] <maxtim> I've run machines off usb sticks before. I was just wondering more about the VM -> img -> usb methodology
[06:59:13] <rk4> main detail would be drive/partition addressing, one supposes using uuids it should all work fine
[06:59:19] <somiaj> the trick there might be making it bootable, but otherwise should be fine
[06:59:56] <rk4> if grub points to the wrong place the interactive grub prompt is surprisingly good for digging out of that hole
[07:00:47] <rk4> you could just run the installer on your own computer and install staright to the usb too [or similar theme, point the VM at the usb]
[07:01:16] <maxtim> oh that's not bad
[07:05:16] <rk4> re debian-live, it's been a few years since i used it but it had pretty good infra for building custom live images with arbitrary packages

[13:09:04] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for "Bullseye" has three lines: "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main". See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-updates> and `man sources.list`.

[13:09:38] <Khepra> !bullseye security
[13:09:38] <dpkg> The repository name for <security> updates has changed between buster and bullseye.  Now it is: "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". You should also have a line for <stable-updates>. See <sources.list> <bullseye/updates>. Note that you may need to adjust the Default-Release and pinning settings to match this change.
[13:10:06] <Khepra> otherwise the Hetzner mirror works just fine; just correct /updates to -security, and you're goldenm

[13:12:40] <jelly> I loved being able to use zsh extended glob syntax over scp, but they broke it fixing "weaknesses"
[13:13:23] <PMT> evidently even openssh 8.8 doesn't do that scp/sftp wrapper by default either.
[13:13:36] <jelly> so now I sshfs mount the most common remote filesytems
[13:13:38] <Khepra> indeed, it's not yet fully baked and pledged
[13:14:10] <jelly> if you want sftp, use sftp.  There's a dozen clients.  lftp is nice.

[14:45:14] <PMT> It can't power off using the button for soft power off (just pressing it), hard power off (holding it until shutdown), pressing power off in the OS, ...?
[14:45:46] <ss2> The system halts, and stays powered.

[14:47:33] <ss2> okay: in stable, powering off the system will only let it halt, and it stays powered on.  And trying to resume from suspend, or hibernate, never works.  The powerkey doesn't react anymore.

[15:29:14] <Khepra> ss2: efi is supposed to be much easier to use, esp. in multi-boot environments. few problems are most common with it: 1) bad firmware that refuses ANY thing other than (ESP)/EFI/boot   directory;    2) secureboot messing with dkms modules, or even with some in-kernel ones sometimes (I had "fun" time with amdgpu and secureboot)

[17:56:31] <jelly> ss2, very, very carefully add bookworm repos, and see what "apt -s install linux-image-5.14.0-1-amd64" would do, only do it without -s if it would not install anything else, and then remove them
[17:57:20] <jelly> I don't normally advise doing this, but as you're already having hardware trouble and considering switching to testing

[17:58:47] <ss2> fatal: yes.
[17:58:58] <jelly> that too but upstream make deb-pkg might have different enough settings not to trigger the same issue at all
[17:59:33] <Khepra> well, true that
[17:59:57] <Khepra> on that note, I wonder if the .config only can be yanked from salsa
[18:00:00] <jelly> ss2, APT::Default-Release is just a different way of pinning, and won't save you from trouble if you leave the repos enabled
[18:00:16] <jelly> .config is generated I think
[18:01:01] <jelly> last time I looked I did not find an easy way to "get .config actually used for 4.19.0-x-amd64"
[18:01:12] <Khepra> when I frankenstein my debians, I set a blanket Pin-Priority: -1 for Package:* of the Pin: release a=unstable for example,   then do a whitelist of packages with a separeate entry at priority 500
[18:01:50] <Khepra> downside is you have to list each and every dependency explicitly otherwise you have "packages held" with apt not offering clues as to why
[18:02:10] <jelly> aptitude is smarter in such cases

[18:09:21] <jelly> I don't think that's the whole thing
[18:09:55] <ss2> + you get a nice osd volume knob.
[18:10:02] <Khepra> jelly: it's not, it's just deviations from default, so you run oldconfig target with that as .config
[18:10:26] <Khepra> at least ... that's what it looks like, and it builds
[18:10:58] <fatal> ss2: it's the same when i use `pactl set-sink-volume`, anyway i just want to know if it's possible to cap it at max like alsamixer does.
[18:11:04] <jelly> you need that + parent ../config + who knows what else
[18:11:17] <jelly> and I gave up after that
[18:12:49] <ss2> fatal: yeah, unfortunately I haven't figured out how it can be prevented in pulseaudio in general.  There should be a setting somewhere to prevent overdriving or such.
[18:13:00] <Khepra> it's a weird implementation. I would've expected a base .config + proper /patches/

[18:27:35] <ss2> just booting it.
[18:27:46] <Khepra> ss2: you'll need headers too if you have any DKMS modules
[18:28:42] <Khepra> (and note that linux-image-amd64 is metapackage that pulls in linux-image-<version>-<arch>, so it's several packages)
[18:29:08] <ss2> and powering down..
[18:29:15] <ss2> and it works!
[18:29:35] <jelly> ss2, whether it's safe depends on how many extra packages want to be installed or upgraded
[18:30:06] <fatal> \o/
[18:30:48] <fatal> jelly: also uninstalling backports first i guess?
[18:31:04] <ss2> I'd have to think about it.  The result now btw is, that I have to press the power button for 10 seconds, to ‘drain’ it internally -- got that off a video from Lenovo themselfs -- to power it up again.
[18:31:09] <jelly> no, why
[18:31:27] <fatal> i read it somewhere
[18:32:08] <jelly> mixing releases is almost never safe, regardless of whether there's also backports enabled
[18:33:42] <jelly> possible exception is mixing old release into a newer installation, because you're not likely to accidentally upgrade or install something old that way

[23:17:41] <mattb0ne> what would i grep to check at boot
[23:17:58] <fatal> nothing, you just see the monitor working usually.
[23:18:08] <fatal> maybe it is disabled in the bios
[23:18:28] <fatal> xrander is just for your xsession aka desktop

[23:19:47] <mattb0ne> well i have cinnamon as my desktop environment
[23:20:22] <mattb0ne> so you think my problem is at the bios level
[23:20:31] <fatal> if you have two monitors you should see maybe grub on both or splash screen on both.
[23:20:40] <mattb0ne> so I should see the monitor connected
[23:20:52] <greycat> If I'm reading the situation right, the BIOS (firmware) configuration is one of several *possible* causes.
[23:21:19] <fatal> mattb0ne: it depends, what do you usually see during boot?
[23:23:02] <mattb0ne> ok let me try and get to my bios
[23:23:25] <mattb0ne> it is tough because I cannot see half the screen so I am not sure how I can make changes there =(
[23:25:29] <fatal> but you also could try and boot with the working one, then after x started see if xrander can tell you anything about plugged in monitors
[23:26:19] <greycat> In what context are you seeing "half the screen"?  BIOS?  GRUB?  Booted to console?  Booted to Display Manager (GUI login)?  X session running?  Wayland session running?
[23:27:11] <mattb0ne> like my screen is physically busted
[23:27:55] <mattb0ne> so I have perfect image on the bottom half of my screen and nothing on top
[23:27:58] <mattb0ne> taht is my main screen
[23:28:03] <fatal> boot with the working setup first, plug in another monitor, check xrander before you go into the bios.
[23:28:17] <mattb0ne> this is my main window
