[00:41:38] <carlino3> is it safe to use CSS grid layout? (talking about portabillty across browsers)
[00:45:24] <entuland> carlino3, check the browser support at the end of this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid
[00:58:36] <carlino3> entuland internet explorer is the only one not supported
[00:58:38] <carlino3> so i guess is ok?
[00:58:44] <carlino3> who uses internet explorer nowadays?
[00:59:09] <entuland> can't tell for sure, but someone likely still does, it depends whether you care about it or not

[05:18:13] <AMcBain> Remember when they optimized their phones to be faster instead of just decided to unilaterally change how z-index worked for the same reason and everyone else had to go along with it? OH WAIT.
[05:20:09] <pavonia> Is there an explanation of how those things are related?
[05:20:09] <AMcBain> https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2012/09/Stacking-Changes-Coming-to-position-fixed-elements Yeah. Anyway.
[05:21:07] <AMcBain> Google created Chrome/Chromium using WebKit. iOS + Android being based on WebKit = huge market share. When you have a huge market share you can just do whatever you want. See Internet Explorer prior to 8.
[05:21:26] <AMcBain> Spec gives you trouble because it's not performant? Toss it out!
[05:22:36] <AMcBain> Chrome and Chromium (thus also Edge) are now based on Blink which is a fork of WebKit, but they still have more share of the browser market (mobile and desktop) than anyone else because most browsers are based on it or Chromium.
[05:23:09] <AMcBain> Firefox is the last independent and complete web rendering engine, but they took so long to ditch the components that made it difficult to integrate into apps that everyone went with Chromium/Blink.
[05:23:18] <AMcBain> Sorry, Chromium/WebKit*
[05:24:26] <AMcBain> and if you don't think that's scary, well, this is what they do with that: https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/ Create whole new ways to track you to serve ads because everyone has gotten just good enough at increasing privacy on the web.

[05:41:33] <vancz> does anyone know any github repos collecting techniques for doing interactivity purely in css
[05:41:44] <vancz> apparently its possible to do modals in pure css for example
[05:41:53] <vancz> and i dont see why a lot of other stuff wouldnt be able to work too
[05:42:01] <AMcBain> Many things are possible with checkboxes. (tm)
[05:42:09] <AMcBain> but that doesn't mean you should.
[05:42:28] <vancz> there's https://css-components.felipefialho.com/ for example, but the repo https://github.com/felipefialho/css-components/ says there are "better things to do" now
[05:42:40] <vancz> yeah I figured a lot of it would be checkbox tricks

[05:43:59] <AMcBain> So I don't know how well this works in Chrome now but it had a an issue or two there when I wrote it: http://articles.asmcbain.net/articles/selectalike/demo.html
[05:44:13] <AMcBain> It's a replacement for selects that just uses radio buttons.
[05:45:11] <AMcBain> Seems to work OK in Edge.
[05:46:20] <AMcBain> Ah, it's not accessible. You can't tab between values or use the arrow keys.
[05:46:34] <vancz> ha ha ha ha ha

[06:32:02] <FunkyBob> what's the point of any elements if you can just style them?
[06:32:13] <vancz> *shrugs cluelessly*
[06:32:33] <vancz> it just adds to my confusion that IIRC div and span arent semantic
[06:32:38] <FunkyBob> the point is HTML is not for presentation, it's for describing content and its structure, semantics
[06:33:15] <vancz> and what happens if the inner display type of something conflicts with the outer display type of it's contents?
[06:34:27] <FunkyBob> you mean something display: block; inside something display: inline;  for instance?
[06:35:19] <vancz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div 'As a "pure" container, the <div> element does not inherently represent anything.'
[06:35:19] <vancz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span 'The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything.'
[06:35:49] <vancz> Im looking at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model:
[06:35:53] <vancz> "At this point, we'd better also explain inner and outer display types. As mentioned above, boxes in CSS have an outer display type, which details whether the box is block or inline.
[06:35:53] <vancz> Boxes also have an inner display type, however, which dictates how elements inside that box are laid out. "
[06:36:02] <FunkyBob> it als odoesn't hurt to remember <div> is your container-of-last-resort
[06:36:13] <FunkyBob> http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png
[06:36:29] <FunkyBob> div and span are sort of like the archetypal block and inline elements, respectively
[06:36:36] <vancz> cool thanks for that flowchart
[06:36:59] <vancz> i really wish there were more coherent learning sources with all this stuff :/

[15:33:12] <entuland> Auctus, not sure if there is a question there somewhere
[15:34:16] <Auctus> entuland: i asked it the other day, but im back because i've figured out the answer
[15:34:25] <entuland> well, that's _one_ approach
[15:34:38] <Auctus> what's another?
[15:34:43] <Auctus> i couldnt figure it out any other way
[15:34:55] <entuland> you could create just one SVG of that decoration and stick it as background of a single div, you can have more than one background and more than one background placement
[15:35:00] <Auctus> my new approach is 4 divs with border-radius for 1 corner only
[15:35:13] <entuland> the background approach doesn't require additional markup at all
[15:35:18] <Auctus> svg has to be drawn programatically to scale right, I think
[15:35:25] <Auctus> otherwise itll warp the corner
[15:35:36] <entuland> not sure I get what you mean there
[15:35:53] <entuland> you can have SVGs with specified dimensions as backgrounds
[15:36:09] <Auctus> if the div changes size, the border-radius would warp, like resizing a circle, i was hoping to get it kind of dynamic without too much screwing around
[15:36:12] <Auctus> which i think ive done now
[15:36:19] <entuland> oh I see
[15:36:24] <Auctus> border-radius of an SVG that is, that would warp
[15:36:30] <Auctus> if you werent drawing the SVG dynamically
[15:36:31] <entuland> yes, resizing would be an issue if you stretch the decoration
[15:36:47] <Auctus> i was going to draw the svg dynamically for that reason, but i think this will be easier and better
[15:36:49] <entuland> but you could keep the decoration size and simply increase the whitespace
[15:37:01] <entuland> sure, you can do that with borders and additional markup
[15:37:14] <entuland> try and take advantage of pseudo ::before and ::after though
[15:37:22] <entuland> to reduce the amount of markup
[15:42:53] <hunboy> Auctus, https://jsfiddle.net/7Lhftg24/
[15:49:59] <hassoon> Auctus: what you're trying to achieve seems to be doable with only one container (say a div) that has one rounded solid border, what's with the 4 divs approach ?
[15:53:23] <entuland> probably wanting gaps in the middle of the four sides
[15:53:49] <hassoon> entuland: padding does that
[15:54:02] <entuland> not sure I follow
[15:54:21] <hassoon> what ?
[15:54:27] <entuland> padding increases the distance of the contents to the border
[15:54:45] <entuland> padding wouldn't "erase" the border in the middle of a side as they shown in their screenshot
[15:55:29] <hassoon> entuland: ah, yes, they need that erasure..
[15:55:36] <hassoon> entuland: but yes, vertical padding only
[15:55:51] <hassoon> entuland: and pseudoelements to do the erasure part
[15:56:04] *** Quits: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa) (Quit: Bye!)
[15:56:28] <Auctus> pseudoelements are something i just learned about yesterday
[15:56:35] <hassoon> entuland: otherwise, a background-image prepared speifically for that container will work
[15:56:38] <hassoon> Auctus: ^
[15:56:40] <entuland> not sure that would work as they want the whole thing transparent
[15:56:53] <entuland> the background image seems ruled out due to stretching as discussed above
[15:57:15] <Auctus> plus i want a whole-screen background texture, so i cant texture the inside of this div, or the texture wont line up
[15:57:42] <hassoon> entuland: why not background-image using base64 svg
[15:57:47] <Auctus> hunboy: youre a bit of a wizard to me, i appreciate your input up there
[15:58:23] <entuland> hassoon, as discussed above, they may want the straight line to adapt but the round section not to stretch
[15:58:33] <hassoon> Auctus: pseudo elements are just like any usual element you work on in css, but they are not accessable in javascript DOM
[15:59:16] <hassoon> Auctus: ::before and ::after
[15:59:38] <Auctus> i know what im trying to do is dead simple if i can just remember how to do 3 columns, so that the side two fill up whatever space is left after the middle column has text put in it
[15:59:45] <hunboy> Auctus, this is better: https://jsfiddle.net/7Lhftg24/1/
[16:01:23] <hassoon> ah entuland mentioned the same suggestions above
[16:01:38] <hassoon> Auctus: well ya pseudoelements or svg background
[16:02:47] <Auctus> this is gonna be cool once its workin lol
[16:03:04] <Auctus> look like a fighter jet or a mainframe control panel or something
[16:03:47] *** Trieste_ is now known as Trieste
[16:08:17] <entuland> a slightly different approach based on hunboy's one, Auctus: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/4wL15bge/
[16:11:30] <entuland> the gaps on the top / bottom edges will be dictated by the grid template
[16:11:47] <entuland> the gap on the left / right edges would be dictated by the content
[16:12:13] <entuland> if you need the gap on the left / right edges to be shorter than the content, then you'd need additional trickery to account for the overlapping
[16:13:03] <entuland> easily obtained with negative margins on the content and forcing the height of the top / bottom spans
[16:16:11] <hassoon> Auctus: got the image of that sky in the background ?
[16:20:17] <entuland> variation on the above to allow overlapping: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/4wL15bge/1/
[16:23:19] <entuland> crap, my first link got broken somehow
[16:25:30] <entuland> fixed the first link
[16:27:32] <Auctus> hassoon: i cant find it now, it was just a placeholder from pexels.com, any texture would do for testing the effect
[16:27:46] <Auctus> wait i probably saved it so i can find its name and link, sec
[16:28:03] <entuland> test with a background: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/4wL15bge/3/
[16:28:11] <hassoon> Auctus: no worries, got another one from google images search
[16:30:54] <hassoon> entuland: reminds me of ms office that bg
[16:31:07] <hassoon> back when i was toying with its background images when i was a kid
[16:32:15] <Auctus> you know why i came up with this idea https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/F-15_Eagle_Cockpit.jpg
[16:32:17] <entuland> eheheh, picked the first mostly white background cause I couldn't bother changing the color of the font and the decorations
[16:36:02] <hassoon> ya entuland 's fiddle is fine https://jsfiddle.net/9euzgpLj/
[16:40:16] <hassoon> another small update of entuland 's fiddle :> .round { text-align: center; width: calc(100% - 20px);
