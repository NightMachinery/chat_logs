[02:27:30] <lalia> Been slowly outlining an RPG campaign based heavily on my experience as an ancient Greek classicist. It'll wind up being a heavily mythologized version of Athens around the time Socrates was a child.
[02:28:18] <spruit11> what happened during Socrates' lifetime that that period is more interesting?
[02:28:20] <lalia> A time when the Gods were losing their influence over the citizens in Athens as the city developed more of their own take on governance and art.
[02:28:30] <spruit11> ah
[02:28:52] <lalia> The time of the tragedians. :)
[02:29:21] <lalia> Arguably the final period of epic storytelling for the anicent Greeks.
[02:30:14] <spruit11> right,  what we need is a horizontal organisation
[02:30:27] <spruit11> like Marx intended
[02:32:50] <lalia> :) Marx theorized spaces for structured heirarchies from what I remember. The thinker I'd take as being more of a solid example of what might be called horizontal organization would be bell hooks.

[02:52:51] <lalia> I've got no response to that, spruit11. Maybe that's not an especially charitable take? I don't know.
[02:53:26] <Parf> spruit, tell us how you really feel! i guess i agree on most points with that rural interpretation, though some towns are idyllic, despite all of that. those seem like minimal concerns, really, compared with some of the larger battles wrought on the asphalt webs
[02:54:03] <spruit11> sure,  I imagine lots of towns are really nice with nice people.
[02:55:22] <spruit11> it's just that when you're going to organize it per town I think you'll just allow all the depravity in the world
[02:55:53] <Parf> you would remember it, i think, lalia. it's rather provocative, but it's a sort of quality peer through the greek mythos, but with a magical realism style, somehow it oscillates between reality and surreality in just the right way, you might enjoy it, is the only reason i mention it, @lalia

[02:57:14] <Parf> spruit, i don't know that i see anything but an intensification of the "do what thou wilt" motto within the urban sphere
[02:58:03] <Parf> perhaps it is of a different color, but with refined tastes in anything, there is a sort of increase in wickedness that prevails when one has a more developed sense of how to be truly wretched
[02:58:40] <Parf> there are more back doors and "empty" chambers strewn about the concrete than there ever could be established in even the best rural encampment
[02:59:12] <Parf> usually word gets out and they're split up besides, but in the urban dweller's evil realm, one can find that politicians have power that extends beyond the county, or even the country itself
[02:59:24] <lalia> I'm really not sure how to address this without bombarding you with questions... I'll just say flat organizational structures are a reasonably common tendency among coop and union organizers. Seems like it works out alright.
[02:59:32] <lalia> Parf: thanks for suggesting. :)
[02:59:39] <Parf> my pleasure
[03:00:09] <spruit11> ? there's no 'do what thy willt' in the urban sphere.

[03:01:04] <lalia> So did I.
[03:01:10] <Parf> and you pretend that depravity exists that far outstrips that that exists in a rural setting?
[03:01:19] <lalia> In Southern California, late 90s.
[03:01:36] <Parf> the most the rurals can meekly assemble is a festival or two, grateful dead importers, old boy connects

[03:01:39] <spruit11> ?

[04:13:04] <spruit11> the only thing I know that in the smaller psytrance ones,  which were the thing I was somewhat into,  people probably took a cut
[04:13:57] <lalia> I still love funky and tribal house. People like DJ Dan and Marc Balance get a lot of playtime with me. :)
[04:14:16] <lalia> Psy is a great genre.
[04:14:21] <lalia> I loved it on the dancefoor. Super rockin.
[04:14:40] <spruit11> they're just often nice people.  was more international than the rest too
[04:14:42] <lalia> Easy to get lost in the crowd.
[04:15:14] <lalia> Sure, that sounds right. :)
[04:15:25] <lalia> Good vibes generally, in my experience.
[04:15:42] <lalia> I spent more than a few nights lost in goa tents. :D
[04:18:42] <lalia> Utah had a kind of underground organization of event hosts and getting into it meant taking shit from the senior members for quite some time. Garbage deal, IMO.
[04:18:57] <lalia> I got out of events at that point and focused on academic stuff.
[04:19:20] <lalia> Still love the music tho.

[04:23:00] <spruit11> I ended liking it more behind the scenes,  mostly lights,  until that too ended.  it just became incredibly boring
[04:23:19] <spruit11> moved on
[04:23:27] <spruit11> still nice memories
[04:26:49] <lalia> Sure, that makes sense. Organizing events takes a lot, even if you're secondary stage crew: still gotta battle through get those waters for the DJs and whatnot, right? It all loses its shine eventually.
[04:28:39] <spruit11> pffrt.  I've done lots of stuff,  from slicing melons to making a balance sheet.
[04:28:57] <lalia> Hosting seemed to be profitable enough but honestly, it got to be pretty soul-draining. DJs aren't a lot of fun to cater to a lot of the time. I got really tired of the demands.
[04:29:22] <lalia> I really enjoyed event setup. For whatever reason it was more relaxing to work without the crowd. :D
[04:30:59] <lalia> spruit11: did you work for recurring events, like clubs or were they more like concert events?
[04:31:13] <lalia> I mostly did the latter type events.
[04:31:35] <spruit11> mostly I think 5k techno and about 200 psy.  But did some other stuff too.
[04:32:06] <audrey> lalia: spruit11, as long if it doesn't end up like the Alamont Free Concert, you're probably doing it right :D
[04:32:11] <audrey> *Altamont
[04:32:40] <beltwaybob> lalia: I am surprised you didnt mention the #1 thing that both the money-makers and the partiers have in common
[04:32:44] <beltwaybob> Fucking high out of its mind teenaged pussy
[04:33:02] <audrey> er, what
[04:33:06] <beltwaybob> I was never in any scene, but I know enough about it from people who were to know that the #1 fixation of the "types" in those scenes is fucking teenaged girls
[04:33:10] <beltwaybob> I mean, who wouldn't?
[04:33:11] <beltwaybob> I don't mena like 13
[04:33:22] <beltwaybob> And depending on the state laws, it can be absolutely ridiculous, e.g. an age of consent of 18
[04:33:23] <spruit11> Big venues were in (concert) halls,  smaller ones outdoors or bars.

[04:33:32] <lalia> Well, I take you to mean just all sorts of sexual activity... and yeah, there was a lot.
[04:33:38] <audrey> and one of the reasons why I don't go to them anymore

[04:34:16] <spruit11> Yah.  Makes sense.  You come to a psytrance party with your wife and kids and what you want is teenage pussy.
[04:34:17] <beltwaybob> 'Officer, I was raised by television, and I think men are nice and kind and jus tlooking to talk about poetry, I had NO IDEA they were into THAT!!!"
[04:34:23] <beltwaybob> spruit11: LOL
[04:34:27] <lalia> beltwaybob: normally the crowds were getting into molly and looking for corners to take turns giving eachother lightshows and orgasms.
[04:34:36] <beltwaybob> lalia: There is the party then the after-party
[04:34:42] <beltwaybob> Lots of short-guys who wouldn't ever get laid without drugs
[04:34:48] <beltwaybob> Like, laughably hilariously tiny little men
[04:35:03] <beltwaybob> Like 'we used to use these things as slave labor, they're so cute' short guys
[04:35:11] <beltwaybob> But give them a firearm or a controlled substance and suddenly they're king shit
[04:35:15] <lalia> I wasn't really up for any of that, I was mostly there for the music or the money. :P
[04:35:20] <audrey> well, I'm a woman past college age, so screwing teenaged girls isn't exactly high on my priority list
[04:35:24] <beltwaybob> Yeah, that's is what I am saying
[04:35:58] <lalia> It got real wild a lot of the time tho, for sure.
[04:36:00] <audrey> I used to go to some fairly ... "hi energy" dances at nightclubs but honestly was just there to enjoy the atmosphere
[04:36:13] <beltwaybob> You're people chatting on IRC
[04:36:15] <beltwaybob> You are already atypical
[04:36:19] <beltwaybob> We can pretty much write you off :P

[04:36:49] <audrey> Hey, if I were 18 again maybe I'd do that once or twice

[04:37:11] <audrey> but for a thirty year old to do that stuff is ... questionable. :P
[04:37:13] <beltwaybob> lalia: the issue is how precarious life is for males, the women will always do fine, the issue is how these drugs can really push a male off the rails.
[04:37:16] <lalia> I totally robbed drug dealers, but I would try to keep the kids safe when I spotted youngsters.
[04:37:29] <beltwaybob> A woman can basically do as many drugs as she wants and then take a course and become a secretary for the county, etc. no matter the gap in her resume
[04:37:30] <Toadisattva> nah when you get above 30's and 40's you start going to burning man instead
[04:37:32] <beltwaybob> I have seen it happen loads of times
[04:37:35] <audrey> beltwaybob: I mean, date rape etc. is a real thing at parties
[04:37:39] <Toadisattva> your a big kid now you don't need to dance with teenagers
[04:37:41] <Toadisattva> <3
[04:37:54] <lalia> Felt obligated to make sure high schoolers were dealing with minimal drama. That's always a nightmare.
[04:38:01] <beltwaybob> audrey: lol, I had a prof at Uni who once started a tutorial with "and then they invented date rape, when I was a young man, there were expectations...both ways..."
[04:38:04] <beltwaybob> And then he stopped talking
[04:38:07] <beltwaybob> By that point he was a bit senile
[04:38:08] <spruit11> Why? The techno crowd,  the 5k thing,  were almost exclusively 30s adults.  They either came with their spouses or friends.
[04:38:16] <beltwaybob> audrey: but you are datying yourself by saying date-rape
[04:38:18] <beltwaybob> that isnt current anymore
[04:38:20] <audrey> beltwaybob: sounds like something a senile old man would say
[04:38:23] <beltwaybob> no
[04:38:28] <audrey> beltwaybob: What?
[04:38:31] <beltwaybob> It's something someone who recognize it was campus sex policing for the benefit of dykes would say
[04:38:34] <spruit11> Don't think they were interested in teenage pussy either.
[04:38:34] <audrey> I'm not dating myself, no. :P
[04:38:40] <beltwaybob> audrey: well, I doubt anyone else would
[04:38:44] <lalia> Anyhow... I've got to give the kiddo a bath. Take care, fam.
[04:38:47] <spruit11> But if they ended up with one,  don't care.
[04:38:48] <beltwaybob> That jokes words better if it's a male engineer who says "I'm datoing myself"
[04:39:07] <audrey> In fact the closer I get to middle age the less sex and all the associated drama, interest me

[04:39:12] <audrey> So I can view it with a kind of disinterested fascination
[04:39:26] <audrey> Pretty crazy, what the libido can make people do.
[04:39:46] <beltwaybob> spruit11: again, I don't know what sort of parties you went to, I was never much of a partier, but there are girls 18-25 at most of them, and they're there to use sex to manipulate men into giving them free drugs
[04:39:51] <beltwaybob> They wojuld otherwise have to pay for said drugs
[04:40:10] <beltwaybob> spruit11: I am not the sort of guy who would ever trade drugs for sex, but there are some men who are into that sort of thing
[04:40:17] <beltwaybob> And there are women who know that type of man, too.
[04:40:30] <beltwaybob> It's not the one-sided "male predator" thing that the campus leatherdykes would have you believe
[04:40:47] <beltwaybob> oh hell, 18, 15, 13, whatever
[04:40:55] <spruit11> Dude,  if you're 16 and interested in drugs you fucking know very well where to find the dealer.
[04:40:58] <beltwaybob> lol
[04:41:12] <Toadisattva> honestly a lot of there were to dance and have powerful transformational experiences
[04:41:21] <lalia> The whole scene got pretty nefarious in a variety of ways by the late 90s, TBH. It got a lot better after organizers started insisting on throwing legit events.
[04:41:23] <Toadisattva> us were there*
[04:41:25] <Toadisattva> wow I can't type
[04:41:46] <audrey> but yeah I'm not really keen on celebrating 16 year olds trading sex for drugs
[04:41:52] <beltwaybob> lalia: this just means that the picking up happens using a sort of coded lingo, like "you want to go back to my place and ___" whatever the slang term is, roll, trip, get high, etc.
[04:42:16] <spruit11> Everything can happen always.  Not the parties I remember or what girls are interested in.
[04:42:17] <audrey> seems like a bad example of women's liberation, honestly, with all of the risks and dangers associated with that

[04:42:25] <audrey> I don't know if that's what you were getting at.
[04:42:26] <lalia> Underground raves weren't a good idea ultimately. They needed to be turned into regulated events.
[04:42:34] <lalia> It got a lot safer as a result, IMO.
[04:42:37] <beltwaybob> audrey: I am not a moralist, I see it as a bunch of monkeys doing what monkeys do.
[04:42:44] <beltwaybob> I think it could be made a lot safer for the monkeys by legalizing the drugs
[04:42:52] <beltwaybob> But then you have all sorts of 5'6 douchebags who only get laid because they have a pocket full of coke

[04:44:16] <beltwaybob> There are beer whores
[04:44:23] <beltwaybob> Again, these are things that nice people will just never experience
[04:44:26] <spruit11> Unless you're into heroin.
[04:44:36] <beltwaybob> You go out to the bar with your decent friends and one of them isn't trying to trade beer with a down and out woman for a blowjob in the restroom
[04:44:45] <beltwaybob> It also depends on the sort of bar you go to
[04:44:53] <beltwaybob> Like, that sort of thing is only possible in dive bars

[04:46:15] <Toadisattva> all my middle class friends did and continue to do this
[04:46:36] <beltwaybob> Oh, OK
[04:46:59] <beltwaybob> None of mine do, they're either sober boring people or, like, they like to go to burning man and get so high that they cannot walk or do anything once a year

[04:47:07] <audrey> "We were near Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold."

[04:47:36] <lalia> It has always sucked.
[04:47:47] <lalia> It still does from what I've experienced. :D
[04:47:53] <beltwaybob> That whole area is just waiting for the US Army Engineers to divert the columbia river completely after annexing Canada

[04:49:16] <lalia> Why people still live there is a fucking mystery. LOL.
[04:49:47] <beltwaybob> Oh, it's not even a mining town
[04:49:48] <lalia> audrey: I know but I also thought these reflections were humorous. :P
[04:50:13] <audrey> heh. I need to get back to my own writings on that subject :DD
[04:50:28] <lalia> I lived through Fear and Loathing as much as I was able to for a few years.
[04:50:29] <beltwaybob> Hunter Thomspon was not a very nice man
[04:50:47] <lalia> Hunter S was my hero as an undergrad. Definitely not a nice person. :P
[04:50:52] <beltwaybob> wtf
[04:50:57] <beltwaybob> why would he be anyone's hero?
[04:51:03] <audrey> Though in my story it's a bunch of snotty rich college kids destroying a coastal Mediterranean town.
[04:51:14] <audrey> Same schtick.
[04:51:24] <lalia> At the time I thought his zero fucks attitude was awesome. I also admire his writing.
[04:51:25] <audrey> Well he was a helluva writer
[04:51:29] <lalia> His tallent was incredible.
[04:51:29] <beltwaybob> He was not a very good writer.
[04:51:32] <Toadisattva> he was a brilliant author and a superhuman mutant of a drug user
[04:51:33] <beltwaybob> LOL
[04:51:35] <lalia> Bullshit, dude.
[04:51:41] <Toadisattva> oh yeah he was
[04:51:45] <beltwaybob> You haven't read Doonesbury's "savage" charicature of him, have you?
[04:51:49] <audrey> Hm?? His prose is very unique, in a good way too.
[04:51:50] <Toadisattva> have you read the rum diary?
[04:51:53] <beltwaybob> Yeah
[04:51:55] <beltwaybob> I've read all his stuff
[04:52:11] <lalia> beltwaybob: you're just wrong, tho. I hope you appreciate that. He cultivated his craft incredibly well.
[04:52:12] <audrey> "As your attorney, I advise you to get high as fuck, mkay?"
[04:52:16] <beltwaybob> His prose is not that unique, he is like a rip-off of that guy who wrote the electric koolaid acid test
[04:52:19] <beltwaybob> who is that guy
[04:52:20] <beltwaybob> I can't remember
[04:52:28] <Toadisattva> he crated the gonzo style
[04:52:31] <Toadisattva> it's others ripping on him
[04:52:33] <beltwaybob> lalia: He even says it himself in Fear and Loathing what he thinks of journalists.
[04:52:35] <audrey> I've read the Electric Koolaid Acid Test and it's ... not the same writing style
[04:52:35] <lalia> Toadisattva: fer sher.
[04:52:44] <beltwaybob> audrey: It's new-style american journalism
[04:52:57] <audrey> there's a similarity in the theme (drug use, etc.) but as far as prose goes, it's not the same
[04:52:59] <Toadisattva> tom wolfe and hunter thompson were running the same scene
[04:53:03] <Toadisattva> the prankster the angels
[04:53:10] <audrey> Honestly it sounds to me like maybe you haven't read the works in question? :confused:
[04:53:12] <lalia> De Beauvoir refused to accept her work as praiseworthy or impactful.
[04:53:18] <lalia> Doesn't mean she was correct.
[04:53:19] <audrey> Or we're just getting really conflicting opinions.
[04:53:22] <Toadisattva> san francisco in the middle 60's was a very spacial time and place to be
[04:53:23] <audrey> No accounting for taste, after all. :D
[04:53:23] <lalia> It's been very much both.
[04:53:23] <beltwaybob> After American publishing houses realzied that the unwashed masses were not interested in, and could not be reasonably be made aware of, information, they settled on a sort of "VOOM VA VA VOOM BRRRR BRRR GRRRRRR then I was in Memphis at the Convention" style of journalism
[04:53:43] <beltwaybob> audrey: they're both American "perspective journalism" because the objective facts are not talked about
[04:53:48] <beltwaybob> e.g. how the Government sells debt to finance itself
[04:53:50] <beltwaybob> I mean, that's boring
[04:53:51] <lalia> beltwaybob: fer real, you're not making sense to me on the Thompson front outside of suggesting he wasn't a good person.
[04:53:53] <lalia> He was not.
[04:53:53] <beltwaybob> That's just how it is.
[04:53:53] <lalia>  :D
[04:54:11] <Toadisattva> no argument there he wasn't a good person
[04:54:26] <Toadisattva> but boy what a ride his life was to witness
[04:54:28] <beltwaybob> Are you going to make me look up the page in fear and loathing wher ehe compares journalists to, I can't remember if it is winos or monkeys jacking off in a zoo?
[04:54:39] <Toadisattva> now I gotta find the quote
[04:54:40] <beltwaybob> He was first and foremost an addict, first tobacco/beer, then whatever else.
[04:54:49] <beltwaybob> And people who have that sort of disposition always find SOMETHING to do to fund their addiction
[04:55:03] <beltwaybob> Most people downplay tobacco addiction
[04:55:05] <beltwaybob> But it is a savage motherfucker
[04:55:08] <Toadisattva> "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!". - Hunter S. Thompson
[04:55:14] <lalia> You're making a strange argument that doesn't seem to pan out to match the facts. That's what I'm saying, beltwaybob. You wouldn't be proving anything by looking up a quote.
[04:55:15] <Toadisattva> totally describes his life to the T
[04:55:24] <beltwaybob> Toadisattva: No it doesn't, he shot himself.
[04:55:27] <beltwaybob> He pussied out.
[04:55:34] <beltwaybob> lalia: What facts?
[04:55:35] <Toadisattva> he said decades before that he would
[04:55:36] <lalia> Ah... I knew I should have left.
[04:55:41] <Toadisattva> that he would leave on his own terms
[04:55:42] <lalia> I'll just head out now.
[04:55:48] <lalia> Toadisattva: a pleasure.
[04:55:53] <Toadisattva> be well
[04:55:59] <beltwaybob> lalia: lol, you idolize this guy
[04:56:05] <beltwaybob> it's why I don't read any of Timothy Leary's biography :P
[04:56:13] <lalia> beltwaybob: you don't know me, kiddo. Just relax.
[04:56:14] <beltwaybob> I don't fucking care how much of a drunken irish prof he was
[04:56:15] <lalia> Take care.
[04:56:21] <Toadisattva> poor leary he gets so much flack for three sentences
[04:56:26] <audrey> beltwaybob: not sure what this level of pugnaciousness is achieving... :|

[04:56:47] <Toadisattva> when his actual writing and interviews and everything were just full of use these things responsibly set and setting spirtuality
[04:57:01] <beltwaybob> audrey: I made a comparison between two "new school" american journalists, tom wolfe and hunter thompson
[04:57:08] <beltwaybob> It's true that their specific language is somewhat different
[04:57:23] <beltwaybob> Buty neither purport to be offering an "objective" set of journalistic facts dictated by some sort of journalistic ethics
[04:57:29] <beltwaybob> Wolfe was less gonzo, but still the same idea
[04:57:38] <beltwaybob> All that goddamned VA VA VOOM, like i want to read motor-car noises

[04:58:17] <beltwaybob> Toadisattva: lol, one of the bits from his biography that I did get, dunno if it's in there, but the two 'two commandments for the molecular age' were made up to prevent his little harvard acid club from having sex with teenaged girls
[04:58:20] <Toadisattva> I mean it all comes out the same scene they were at the same parties taking the same LSD with the same copy of on the road in their backpack
[04:58:23] <beltwaybob> Like, 12, 13, etc.
[04:58:34] <beltwaybob> Toadisattva: nah, it's much more frightening than that.
[04:58:36] <audrey> So what are we talking about here? About the similarity of Fear and Loathing to other American literature? About Thomspon as a person? About whether he had an addiction?
[04:58:48] <audrey> I don't even know what the game plan is for this conversation, honestly.
[04:58:54] <beltwaybob> audrey: The real rift was that I said he wasn't a great writer and that I liked him as much as Tom Wolfe
[04:58:57] <beltwaybob> Isn't that his name?
[04:59:04] <beltwaybob> audrey: We are just chatting---this is a pretty decent chat so far.
[04:59:32] <Toadisattva> I think it was the head of the DEA at the time that said about Millbrook "the panties were dropping faster than the LSD"
[04:59:36] <Toadisattva> they didn't like that much
[04:59:37] <Toadisattva> lol
[04:59:39] <beltwaybob> Toadisattva: Guys like Leary were, in my view, honest versions of what college professors are, and that is why they disliked him.
[04:59:51] <beltwaybob> Toadisattva: Yeah, LSD was an even better way to get laid thna buying martinis for the coeds :P
[05:00:11] <audrey> Okay.
[05:00:23] <audrey> Anyway, I think he's a good writer, have no idea what he'd be like at a dinner table
[05:00:24] <beltwaybob> They weren't allowed to talk honestly once Yale became co-ed tho
[05:00:34] <audrey> probably not very pleasant, but then again I wouldn't be very pleasant to interact with at the dinner table
[05:00:40] <beltwaybob> It was a sore spot for the recently admitted women that Yale profs would explain the law of rape, etc. etc.
[05:00:44] <audrey> too muchs scowling and anorexic cheekbones
[05:00:46] <audrey> :P
[05:01:10] <beltwaybob> Especially in those days, literally the only way you could be convicted, presuming there weren't marks, was if you said something stupid to the police
[05:01:24] <beltwaybob> Otherwise it was the old "he said she said"
[05:01:40] <beltwaybob> And this very much upset the newly-admitted Lesbians who weren't interested in men in the first place
[05:01:53] <lalia> What?!
[05:02:01] <beltwaybob> Other things that upset them included overhearing men offer to pay for theater tickets for women
[05:02:15] <beltwaybob> I found it once, it was some report by one of the first women to go to Yale
[05:02:33] <beltwaybob> It included somewhat reasonable complaints, e.g. the aforesaid profs explaining the law of rape to undergrad men
[05:02:38] <Toadisattva> huh that's pretty interesting
[05:02:49] <beltwaybob> But it also included utterly whacked out nonsense like "he offeed to pay for my theater ticket"
[05:02:58] <beltwaybob> "Tim, I'm not that sort of girl."
[05:03:20] <audrey> What the hell?
[05:03:22] <beltwaybob> Like, the "understanding" that my old prof let on was that in those days, you paid for a girl's theater ticket, you expected not necessarily to get laid, but at least cop a feel, etc.
[05:03:27] <beltwaybob> And it was a two-way street
[05:03:37] <beltwaybob> Like, if a girl didn't WANT that sort of treatment, she could go to a movie with her girlfriends
[05:03:41] <beltwaybob> It wasn't like women were tied to men at that point
[05:03:47] <beltwaybob> But some of the women were raised in tese weird high-class families
[05:03:53] <beltwaybob> And they literally did not understand the transactional nature of sex
[05:03:56] <audrey> lol @ capitalising Lesbians
[05:04:03] <audrey> also @ this whole conversation
[05:04:06] <beltwaybob> So they were, like, horrified that a man wouldn't just buy the theater ticket for NOTHING MORE than her "companionship"
[05:04:09] <beltwaybob> like a hooker who won't put out
[05:04:15] <beltwaybob> And these high class first class at yale broads
[05:04:19] <beltwaybob> It's hysterical reading this stuff
[05:04:20] <Toadisattva> wait isn't that just dating?
[05:04:24] <beltwaybob> Toadisattva: of course it is
[05:04:31] <beltwaybob> Toadisattva: But these were over-bred USA society women
[05:04:40] <beltwaybob> It's a fascinating insight into their level of sexual development
[05:04:55] <beltwaybob> I mean, they basically instituted sexual harassment policy so tha tit wouldn't be a topic of conversation, how sexually immature most american women are
[05:04:56] <spruit11> dunno.  There's always sex after a party but pretty sure there's more sex after a bar visit than a techno rave.
[05:05:12] <beltwaybob> spruit11: attractive people are always having sex no matter what they are doing.
[05:05:19] <beltwaybob> Well, even ugly women are having sex whenever they want
[05:05:26] <spruit11> Like 6 o'clock in the morning? People go to bed.
[05:05:29] <beltwaybob> This idea that there's not a lot of sex going on is a (1) male (2) ugly idea
[05:05:31] <audrey> Always?
[05:05:42] <beltwaybob> audrey: unless they are autistic, that's a real turn off
[05:05:54] <audrey> God, you sound less fun at dinner parties than Lev Tolstoy.
[05:06:06] <beltwaybob> People either love me and let me go on and on or they hate me
[05:06:23] <beltwaybob> By "less fun" do you mean that I would let other people speak?
[05:06:36] <audrey> You don't think there are attractive people who don't have sex?
[05:06:44] <beltwaybob> Well, that would be frigidity.
[05:06:44] <audrey> I really don't understand this conversation
[05:06:48] <beltwaybob> Attraction is inherently sexual in nature
[05:07:03] <audrey> Sounds like you're changing the definition of attractiveness, then.
[05:07:03] <Toadisattva> surely there are, but I'd wager there aren't any attractive people that aren't being sexualized
[05:07:13] <beltwaybob> audrey: uh, why would what you consider attractive be attractive?
[05:07:34] <beltwaybob> Is audrey an example of the aforesaid unsophisticated north american woman who has no idea what 'seduction' means?
[05:07:36] <audrey> I'm a board-certified homosexual, so don't listen to my opinions on the subject. :D
[05:07:40] <beltwaybob> Like, she would go to Yale and get all confused?
[05:07:44] <Parf> raving is still the ticket eh
[05:07:59] <audrey> I seriously have no idea what the context or point of this commentary is. That American women are dumb and entitled?
[05:07:59] <Toadisattva> I miss raving
[05:07:59] <beltwaybob> audrey: oh, well, academically a lot of the good writing about sex comes from queerfs
[05:08:07] <beltwaybob> audrey: That is not the half of it.
[05:08:10] <beltwaybob> But that is part of it.
[05:08:20] <beltwaybob> They are so entitled that they think it is harassment if you write a paper called 'why american women are stupid'
[05:08:37] <beltwaybob> subtitled 'it's because american men are perverts who like this this way'
[05:08:50] <Toadisattva> that's so sexist!
[05:08:54] <Toadisattva> everyone knows all americans are morons
[05:08:55] <Toadisattva> :P
[05:09:06] <beltwaybob> If you are not a moron they will think you are crazy

[18:33:06] <voltage_> what's the first amendment
[18:33:21] <biys> it's amazing to me how the cops almost uniformly across the board push and push and push and become more combative.  i think the idea is that the more a person resists
[18:33:24] <biys> HAHAH
[18:33:25] <biys> i like that
[18:33:34] <biys> the more a person resists...  the guiltier they are
[18:33:53] <biys> so they get visibly upset, they lie constantly, they're evasive, they're aggresive
[18:34:04] <blkshp> DOn't resist the police.
[18:34:44] <voltage_> yes facebook is trying to brainwash you
[18:34:48] <biys> yah i totally get the impression that if you have an encounter with the police you should probably just do as they say and keep your mouth shut
[18:34:52] <voltage_> it already has probably
[18:34:56] <voltage_> your own fault for using it
[18:35:10] <blkshp> biys: yes. That is what you should do
[18:35:54] <biys> end up looking down the barrel of a gun if not
[18:36:04] <biys> and that's just not where a dude wants to be
[18:36:17] <blkshp> Well, that depends where you are.
[18:36:28] <biys> anyways.  i was wondering what tactics it is they'd likely employ and what they're called
[18:36:36] <biys> i imagine there's psychology associated with the way they are trained
[18:36:50] <biys> with a specific political theory as to why it's being employed
[18:36:58] <biys> over the other potential methods
[18:37:33] <biys> i'd say that it almost seems like the cops are attempting to wear a person down psychologically
[18:38:04] <biys> i could see how if a person was in a bad state of mind they'd likely be in trouble for some reason or another
[18:38:10] <blkshp> I think it's unacceptable to refer to these activities as "the cops" a few cops maybe but no one records the good ones and puts them on youtube.
[18:38:20] <biys> and i don't mean an impared state of mind.  i just meed bad state
[18:38:29] <biys> like say they'd just had a loss or some other tragic experience
[18:39:01] <biys> oh.  i wasn't attempting to make a generalization about all cops
[18:39:11] <biys> please note i was simply giving my impresions on the videos i'd seen on youtube
[18:39:34] <biys> i have a very limited experience, myself, with police
[18:39:43] <biys> my neighbour is a cop i think

[20:19:33] <audrey> re: preference vs. intuition ... but where do those preferences come from? Just from speaking to "most people", I get the impression they don't believe "X is wrong" just out of a personal preference but out of some deep seated intuition. I could be mistaken on this, though.
[20:19:39] <audrey> The etiology of morality is fascinating.
[20:20:10] <audrey> I'm more inclined to take the nihilistic view on that, though. Or at least the anti-realist one.
[20:20:26] <Crux> There are two senses of "good": the instrumental and the categorical; "bad" is instrumental while "evil" is categorical. An instrumental good (or bad) is something that facilitates (or inhibits) something else.
[20:20:55] <pussipupu> Oh I'm absolutely not a moral realist, and haven't found any arguments for the position
[20:21:30] <spruit11> yah,  but it has some mostly religious underpinning that there's something like 'evil' out there in the world.

[20:53:15] <audrey> No, I mean a "moral anti-realist".

[20:54:07] <IRCMonkey> Duke Nukem for president.
[20:54:14] <IRCMonkey> Yep
[20:54:45] <IRCMonkey> Does Plato & fatratte come here still ?
[20:54:56] <IRCMonkey> Blech Plato
[20:55:10] <IRCMonkey> I got banned for spamming a link.
[20:55:18] <IRCMonkey> For 6 whole years
[20:55:29] <IRCMonkey> I was advertising Goosh.org.
[20:55:36] <IRCMonkey> Overkill
[20:55:56] <blkshp> Well don't start doing it again.
[20:55:57] <audrey> The user known as "plato" was meeple.
[20:55:59] <IRCMonkey> Someone was interested in it when I posted it, one thing lead to another.
[20:56:11] <audrey> But yes, spamming links indiscriminately is frowned upon.

[20:56:26] <audrey> I haven't seen fattratt in a while. Nice guy
[20:56:39] <IRCMonkey> Yes fattratt was very kind to me.
[20:56:43] <arryana> it's a bit chaotic here at the moment, you?
[20:56:44] <IRCMonkey> Great person
[20:56:58] <blkshp> Well, so far i have you putting lonks on for a youtube video, actually advertising and discussing the advertising of the site you got banned for
[20:57:17] <blkshp> lonks o.O

[21:06:49] <lalia> audrey: Great series. I've liked seeing the innovations in the last few installments: smooth AF.
[21:07:55] <lalia> Reminds me of the stealth factor from the old Tom Clancy games but with a sea of finetuning and other improvements.

[21:08:22] <lalia> Love fattratt.
[21:08:28] <lalia> Hope they're well. Been ages.
[21:08:54] <IRCMonkey> fattratt would've unbanned me
[21:09:21] <lalia> Where are you banned? Doesn't look like it's here.
[21:09:25] <IRCMonkey> I wasn't aware of his actual screenanme though.
[21:09:39] <IRCMonkey> Back on Freenode
[21:09:58] <IRCMonkey> Banned from three channels: chat, programming & philosophy.
[21:10:07] <lalia> Oh, no idea. Am only on here now.
[21:10:17] <blkshp> Ok, so not sure whether you're aware but talking about how you were banned, as this is now the second time, is not  something that's a good idea.
[21:10:37] <IRCMonkey> O.K.
[21:10:43] <voltage_> freenode no longer exists
[21:10:58] <lalia> fattratt had a sea of nicks when we met.
[21:11:01] <voltage_> so you can consider yourself unbanned
[21:11:03] <lalia> publunch was the other.
[21:11:23] <lalia> the other regular one, that is.

[23:31:25] <evolv> what did I win? Doesn't matter
[23:31:46] <evolv> spruit11 is clearly 11
[23:32:13] <evolv> I'm sure spruit translates to, "my current age is"
[23:32:44] <spruit11> it just means 'sprout'.  like 'huis' is 'house' in Dutch.
[23:33:41] <spruit11> the 11 is from the bastardization of a Dutch saying

[23:49:57] <spruit11> dunno,  it's a thing she sings while she plays a specific game with the kids
