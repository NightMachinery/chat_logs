[00:17:17] <zoglesby> someone told me about https://emacs.love/weblorg/ the other day, and it was easy to migrate my blog over. Its like org-publish but meant for blogging 
[00:17:40] <tyson2> grym: once I'm up to speed with hugo I will try a test.  I found that someone else found a hacky way to do it with elm (a front-end tool of course).  I know that hugo can be used with json interfaces etc.
[00:17:44] <zoglesby> before that I used hakyll and that had org support as well, but its haskell so you have a tax
[00:18:26] <hodapp_> I used Hakyll for a bit and while I really liked a lot of the model for how it worked the fact that it wasn't used much meant that a lot of things were difficult
[00:18:45] <hodapp_> so I switched to Hugo and mostly just ran into a totally different set of problems
[00:18:57] <hodapp_> like 99% of which are "I am stubborn and I suck at focusing enough to finish posts"
[00:19:04] <blaub> hodapp_: the question the is: is there something like org?
[00:19:07] <corwin> tbh, in the post xemacs world, if someone makes another meaningful fork of emacs, a human decipherable variant of org is likely to be what drives adoption.
[00:19:23] <hodapp_> blaub: honestly there's really not
[00:19:55] <hodapp_> org's really the only thing like org. I don't know anything that comes close
[00:19:56] <blaub> i don't get bsd's mindset yet, making things simple vs making things dumb
[00:19:56] <corwin> So, for that reason, i hope documenting org's format and making org have a documentable format gain traction.

[00:21:53] <blaub> bkhl: have you been at GLT?

[01:43:03] <kensanata> Aurora_v_kosmose: You need to write this yourself, I think, using setcdr and the like.

[01:43:26] <grym> Aurora_v_kosmose: substrings in strings is not far off from sequence alignment

[01:48:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unicorn_Princess: use-package is nice isn'it?
[01:49:08] <nij-> Is there any text-based database standard (e.g. YAML, JSON) that uses s-expressions?
[01:49:33] <grym> nij-: those are serialization formats
[01:49:40] <grym> and no, i don't believe so
[01:49:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You could relatively seamlessly use XML-backed storage with SXML
[01:50:25] <Unicorn_Princess> Aurora_v_kosmose, i'm coming from vscodium where this behavior is default, so it's gonna be a while before i develop enough of a stockholm syndrome to describe anything in emacs as 'nice', sorry
[01:50:31] <nij-> Aurora_v_kosmose: SXML! SO NEAT :) <3 <3
[01:50:58] <kensanata> sonny: I never use a repeat action, but I love to use keyboard macros. M-x ( to start, M-x ) to end. That also gives you M-x edit-last-kbd-macro, which I like a lot.
[01:51:56] <kensanata> nij-: the tnsnames.ora file for oracle uses parenthesis.
[01:52:01] <nij-> The world in which people do not embrace s-expressions makes me sad.
[01:52:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unicorn_Princess: I mean, it's a centralized config to declare hooks from for abitrary modes. How does vscodium do it? Having to add hooks individually to each mode in otherwise unrelated scripts or in the modes/packages themselves?
[01:52:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The latter is quite feasible in Emacs itself, it's just inconvenient.

[01:53:35] <grym> sure?
[01:53:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> nij-: SXML/S-XML is effectively just an alternate syntax for XML.
[01:53:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it can do everything XML can do and you can relatively easily write a converter.
[01:54:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SXML
[01:57:44] <Unicorn_Princess> Aurora_v_kosmose, no idea how vscodium does it, since i never had to do it, since it did what i wanted (in this case) by default. ignorance was bliss
[01:57:59] <nij-> Yes. It doesn't seem wide spreaded. For example, looking for CL libraries working with SXML, I got nothing 0.0
[01:58:09] <wasamasa> lol

[01:59:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, it's most used with Scheme but could be pretty trivally adapted to work with other Lisps.

[05:30:03] <grym> i've found it performant enough 
[05:30:05] <dale> I think my envrc reinitializes so infrequently that I never notice it blocking, but I'm sure it does.
[05:30:09] <grym> and better than direnv.el 
[05:30:16] <dale> siraben: Are you setting up a lot of new environments or something?

[05:30:33] <dale> I would think it only blocks when direnv has to do something like e.g. create a whole new Python virtual environment.
[05:30:47] <siraben> yeah, in this case it's a Nix environment
[05:31:27] <siraben> and I recently wiped reinstalled nix, so all my projects would still be as reproducible as before but I have to fetch all dependencies again

[20:52:43] <Bayes> so I sometimes call this from cli: emacs -nw -f magit-status, so basically I open emacs in a new windows and evaluate "magit-status" to launch magit
[20:52:57] <Bayes> I was trying to achieve the same with emacsclient
[20:53:29] <Bayes> but for some reason... it seems I couldn't? I tried things like emacsclient -e "magit-status"
[20:55:04] <Bayes> so if I do something like emacsclient -e \(magit-status\), will that run magit-status in the current folder?

[20:55:26] <cvandusen> Yes.
[20:55:45] <cvandusen> though, '(magit-status)' wfm 
[20:56:03] <ryuslash> Bayes: are you trying to run `magit-status' in an existing Emacs window? That should be emacsclient -e "(magit-status)" since --eval takes a lisp for to execute, whereas -funcall takes a function name to call

[20:58:27] <Bayes> hmm ok I will need to debug this further, cause emacsclient -e \(magit-status\) returns "Not inside Git repository"
[20:58:46] <Bayes> so it's probably something about the emacsclient instance not being open on the current folder
[20:59:10] <Bayes> bremner -t ,-n, or -c didn't work
[20:59:13] <Bayes> I'll keep trying
[20:59:39] <ryuslash> Bayes: I don't think that would use your current directory, since all emacsclient should do is instruct Emacs to run that function, which means it'll run it with whatever `default-directory' that your running Emacs instance is already in.
[21:00:02] <Bayes> hm so I do want a new instance running in my current folder
[21:00:34] <ryuslash> or pass the current directory to `magit-status'
[21:00:43] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[21:01:57] <cvandusen> It used the current directory in my test. Alternately, you can send -e '(magit-status "/path/to/repo")'.
[21:02:22] <Unicorn_Princess> so in evil mode, yanking and deleting text both put that text into the clipboard. this seems a bit inconvenient - e.g. i yank(copy) something, delete something else, and want to replace it with what i copied earlier, only to paste what i just deleted.. i know i probably could make delete not put stuff in the clipboard with enough hacking, but first i'd like to know: what's the intended purpose of this? the intended way to 
[21:02:22] <Unicorn_Princess> use this to edit text efficiently. i understand there's also some kill ring, where i can select something i yanked earlier, so that can be a bit of a workaround (yank text A, delete text B, re-select text A from kill buffer..).. but it feels like i'm missing something

[22:52:02] <rudybot_> grym: funny thing is, Phil is basically the same way. he told me once that when people send him encrypted emails, he often tells them "please don't, it's such a pain" (very rough paraphrase, this was 1997)
[22:52:15] <grym> rudybot_: i can't have an argument with you until you've paid 
[22:52:37] <rudybot_> grym: I only ever contracted out on a COBOL job for one, very well paid, week. Almost took a job making double my pay at the time until they discovered I had no degree and well corprate policy and all.

[23:27:08] <gg> plop
[23:27:56] <gg> don't find on the web how to add a menu to the makefile-mode mouse-3 popup menu
[23:28:06] <gg> because I don' find the keymap for this mode
[23:28:32] <twb> well first M-x find-function makefile mode
[23:28:53] <twb> That has (defvar makefile-mode-map
[23:28:57] <gg> (define-key  c-mode-map  [menu-bar C find-def]   '("Find déf" . xref-find-definitions)  )
[23:29:07] <twb>     (define-key map [menu-bar makefile-mode]  looks relevant
[23:29:10] <gg> but I don't find how to transpose to the makefile mode
[23:29:17] <twb> gg: s/c/makefile/ ?
[23:29:43] <gg> hi :)
[23:29:49] <twb> gg: you'll need to wrap in (with-eval-after-load "make-mode" . #) also
[23:31:03] <gg> (for info thats a ffap i want to add to the make file mouse menu :))
[23:31:18] <twb> "which is stored in the cloud so it cannot be lost due to hard drive failure."
[23:31:20] <gg> I check your answer :)
[23:31:28] <twb> The cloud, of course, stores data on regolith

[23:37:42] <twb> oh, wrong channel
[23:38:06] <twb> acdw: but if you think that's cool, you should see the proposal to store information in the air between terra and luna
[23:38:28] <twb> See, an american cosmonaut left a shaving mirror on the moon
[23:38:35] <twb> You can bounce a laser off it, and it comes back to you
[23:38:42] <acdw> twb ooooh
[23:38:44] <twb> And that takes about 20 seconds or something.
[23:38:54] <twb> So, you can send information out, and get it back in 20 seconds.

[23:43:09] <gg> I remember have read in the doc that it does it if there is ever a prefix in the keymap, rmbl...
[23:43:12] <twb> gg: use with-eval-after-load not require
[23:43:27] <gg> *it puts
[23:43:27] <twb> gg: and you probably left "C" as "C" instad of "makefile-mode"
[23:43:40] <gg> no sry i put it as en working exemple
