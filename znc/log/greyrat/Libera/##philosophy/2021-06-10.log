[00:00:56] <Parf> probably will eventually piece together a new model that is cohesive enough to astound us to our very bones
[00:02:36] <Parf> it's getting fast enough now that one needs an intensely broad understanding of a slew of fucking philosophies, technological terminology, physics, just to "keep up". what i ask is not only how many people are actively "keeping up" and how many themselves are already well outside the bounds of their understanding of the projects they're working on
[00:02:49] <lucky> :) in this regard quantum computation is roughly at the level of Alan Turing playing chess against a computer -- himself stepping an algorithm on pen and paper
[00:03:13] <Parf> the ais can beat us at Go now, you know
[00:03:15] <lucky> we do, in fact, having working quantum computers -- simulated by classical ones :) ever so very slowly
[00:03:31] <Parf> they coded the damn protein structure binding protocols for us
[00:03:39] <Parf> we're out of the dark ages
[00:03:49] <Parf> no more wearing ash on your heads
[00:04:39] <Parf> no, we also have larger chips we're building, lucky, just the other day, i read about a chip designed that could simulate an explosion faster than it happens in real time
[00:04:51] <Parf> it's huge, though, the physical chip itself is massive
[00:05:08] <lucky> is this that Cerebras thing?
[00:05:11] <Parf> yeah
[00:06:10] <lucky> Yes, been folowing it for a while.  It's ... actually a pretty big deal technologically speaking.  I wouldn't use cliches like "groundbreaking" or "revolutionary".  Because it was tried in the 70s but didn't really reach a nice price/efficiency point.
[00:06:25] <Parf> well, the achievement itself is revolutionary
[00:06:31] <Parf> that it works!
[00:06:34] <lucky> but if modern chip making techniques let you print out rather literal metre sized chips with quadrillions of transistors, well that'll be neat for high end computing
[00:06:57] <lucky> i mean, do this without suffering intolerably high losses and costs trying to get the giant thing to work
[00:06:59] <Parf> hell, it'll be neat to have these monolithic computers we buy ourselves have some fashion of this technology
[00:07:10] <Parf> instead of typing away at our little keyboards, we'll be floating in some box
[00:07:22] <Parf> conferring with each other wholescale!
[00:07:54] <lucky> Heh.  Ask me 20 years ago and I would *not* have expected to be using a regular keyboard at a desk still.
[00:08:10] <Parf> well, it's about time, wake up!
[00:08:33] <Parf> YOU'LL BE THE CHAMPION OF THAT SPACE. you who have imagined it, meek shall inherit the earth, remember
[00:08:45] <lucky> Turns out you can type with your voice, or a touchscreen, or waving your arms in the air, or even with a mind-reading cap
[00:08:58] <Parf> yeah, there's that nice new hat
[00:09:04] <Parf> the one that uses near infra red
[00:09:14] <lucky> but keyboards are kind of a nice sweet spot, it turns out :p
[00:09:32] <evolv> I remember, about 22 years ago, I used a speech-to-text program
[00:09:34] <evolv> I was excited
[00:09:43] <Parf> couple this infra-red scattering tech with the microscopy developments just before mentioned
[00:09:44] <evolv> it was awful, and I never trusted speech to text again
[00:09:45] <lucky> So maybe it'll be possible to become a disembodied thing floating in a vat through cyberspace
[00:09:49] <lucky> I'm not entirely sure I'll sign up tho :p
[00:09:55] <Parf> wait til they can model the brain in real time and stick an AI next to it
[00:10:03] <Parf> and see if man can make that final jump
[00:10:21] <lucky> evolv: haha, sounds about right.  IBM ViaVoice :p
[00:10:22] <evolv> it wasn't just inaccuracy, it was also having to dictate punctuation
[00:10:32] <Parf> i read an article earlier today that the sense of wanting to upload one's self into a matrix is a sign of narcissism, lowkey
[00:10:35] <evolv> it became clear how complicated such a thing would be
[00:11:11] <Parf> https://www.psypost.org/2021/06/the-dark-personality-trait-known-as-machiavellianism-predicts-support-for-mind-upload-technology-61025
[00:11:12] <ro-bot-o> [url] The dark personality trait known as Machiavellianism predicts support for mind upload technology | www.psypost.org
[00:11:12] <lucky> evolv: I have actually been surprised the last ~5 years.  I honestly did not expect machine learning systems to close the gap they have in so many domains, including speech recognition
[00:11:16] <Parf> i thought this was amusing, anyway
[00:11:42] <evolv> lucky, ML has been impressive in many ways, that's why they're so dangerous
[00:11:46] <Parf> "“Personally, I think mind upload is such a bizarre idea or an ideal, that I think it is important to study how ordinary people feel about it,” Laakasuo said. “This type of technology could (potentially) completely redefine what it means to be human — yet there is practically zero public discussion, politics or interest towards the ethics of creating mind uploaded entities.”"
[00:12:07] <lucky> I always figured it would be like, very gradual incremental progress from more hardware and better algorithms, until/if we ever figure out "real AI" and then maybe it'll solve it for us
[00:12:32] <lucky> an algorithm that can give you an algorithm without needing to go hunt for the algorithm, huh.  didn't see that coming.  i mean, i did but ... i didn't expect it to work so well
[00:12:37] <Parf> we gotta make the shit right now, this is the time if it's going to happen it'll happen very soon
[00:12:43] <Parf> the last five years have been crazy honestly
[00:12:44] <evolv> lucky, they're so incredible in many areas that they're not cautiously interpreted in others
[00:12:57] <lucky> :)
[00:13:34] <evolv> the "data science is objective" types
[00:13:35] <Parf> people simply don't, at large, understand the implications, or are so exhausted by them, that they return to primitivism,
[00:13:42] <lucky> Using AI for this is a very, very bad misnomer
[00:13:45] <Parf> i've seen people shut down in front of my face trying to bring them up to speed
[00:13:48] <lucky> I've switched to machine learning
[00:14:04] <Parf> the quantum world needs a new name as well
[00:14:11] <Parf> no one wants to hear "quantum physics"
[00:14:43] <Parf> they shut down, it's impossible to express, as a rule, to them, they dismiss, because it's so tied with politics as an influence method
[00:15:11] <Parf> because god and religion fight science, and religion implies politics, so he who governs the science, governs god, practically
[00:15:35] <lucky> evolv: lol.  doing some recent experiments with DudeGAN I discovered, or rather the algorithm has spuriously associated probably by some quirk in the dataset, that male body hair is associated with a red-painted bathroom
[00:16:01] <Parf> now scour the globe in your mind for people with this sort of big picture philosophy, combined with the money to do something with it
[00:16:22] <Parf> these people would look like napoleon
[00:16:53] <kmh> Parf, the "zero discussion" is not quite zero to begin with and that the public at large doesn't notice is probably due to the recent globaö circumstances
[00:16:57] <Parf> odd conquerors, easy to make fun of, meanwhile they topple civilizations with sneer
[00:17:26] <lucky> Heh, I do figure there are some people out there with very big plans to literally conquer the whole world in a massive sweep.   Sieze the opportunity and all that.
[00:17:27] <kmh> Parf, wokeness aside morals are on retreat/sidelined for profits
[00:17:53] <lucky> But such people have existed perpetually at all times and such crisis junctures show up regularly and only rarely does someone actually topple entire empires
[00:18:03] <lucky> (:
[00:18:10] <Parf> well sure, that's what happens when you decouple from them, it's just some winding engine without purpose, it's the big scale, the story
[00:19:24] <Parf> you know, i was watching a docu on napoleon, and it was pretty interesting, basically he conquered egypt, just went in and proclaimed himself a muslim, and while they were looking around confused, he built a few museums, found some sarcophagi from kings that were indescribably priceless, basically civilized the entire area with a stroke
[00:19:30] <Parf> by giving value to ancient heritage
[00:19:36] <Parf> that was otherwise buried under sand
[00:19:57] <Parf> what would that look like these days
[00:21:00] <Parf> zero as a point on the scale, kmh?
[00:21:00] <kmh> Parf,  he got severely smacked by the British in Egypt iirc
[00:21:16] <Parf> yeah, eventually, but what he did culturally sent ripples, regardless
[00:21:21] <kmh> Parf,  sorry what scale?
[00:21:33] <Parf> like, any scale, the discussion of zero, whether it exists at all?
[00:21:46] <kmh> of
[00:22:01] <kmh> well does math exist at all
[00:22:10] * Parf nods
[00:22:20] <kmh> or is it all just imagination
[00:22:22] <Parf> the answer is probably something still ambiguous like "sorta"
[00:22:52] <kmh> if you consider math for real, so  would be zero imho (as it shows up almost everywhere in math
[00:22:59] <Parf> my guess is that it exists on some higher plane, now that it's been "developed" even if it's not cohesive in our sensations of it thus far
[00:23:41] <Parf> does seem like a fun discussion
[00:24:56] <kmh> also you can have a scale without a reference point, which in many practical cases is zero
[00:25:28] <lucky> are sets real? then the empty set is real
[00:25:29] <Parf> yeah, that's what i was thinking of, i looked at a scale without any points back there, and i guess that just extends on into infinity, and zero is just a convenient limit.
[00:25:37] <lucky> etc.
[00:25:38] <Parf> it is when i say it is, seems
[00:26:13] <Parf> it's also not that, seems, even when i don't say it is
[00:26:29] <Parf> like, it can contain zero, but zero isn't necessary for the entire system

[00:33:17] <lucky> kmh: Napoleon started it... all
[00:33:54] <lucky> the Ancient Egypt of antiquity was not known as it is now to Europeans in the 18th century.
[00:34:14] <lucky> They didn't know what language they spoke or what gods they may have prayed to, they didn't know if the Pyramids and tombs were built by the same culture
[00:34:30] <Parf> rosetta stone was discovered during that period
[00:34:43] <lucky> wave after wave of aesthetic and pagan-throwback-aspiring influences etc.
[00:35:03] <Parf> the confluence of languages
[00:35:03] <lucky> All because he wanted a desert conquest? I dunno.  I'm sure it would have largely happened to some degree anyway, whatever turn history took.
[00:35:06] <lucky> but it is weird
[00:35:12] <Parf> it's modern thinking, is all
[00:35:38] <Parf> it was simply granted value by his perspective
[00:36:34] <lucky> Yes, the British Museum should really thank him :)
[00:37:05] <kmh> well the rosetta stone sure
[00:37:07] <Parf> why not the world? wasn't egypt itself enriched, in a way? sure some of it seems to be taxed, some of the canopic jars, sure, but the entirety of the knowledge
[00:37:20] <Parf> that it sparked the vision!
[00:37:35] <kmh> but egypt was nevertheless somewhat "well" know via the Greeks afaik
[00:37:43] <lucky> I just find it ironic that the great find historically speaking of his expedition is in the British Museum :p
[00:37:44] <kmh> and the romans actually
[00:37:56] <lucky> Not appropriate, it should probably be in an Egyptian museum, but ironic, yes.
[00:37:58] <lucky> :P
[00:38:28] <Parf> i'm sure it was paid for, surely!

[00:40:14] <lucky> It's actually an interesting hypothetical question.
[00:41:06] <lucky> If you had just text in a language, as much as you could want of it, but in no particular order, beyond say page or chapter length passages, with no general connection to each other, and with no other language used in the text
[00:41:14] <Parf> carlyle talked a bit about "great" men not being actually good, but "great" being its own sort of league, that you could be a lecher, a mule, a monster, whatever, but you could be great for doing things or seeing things beyond the mark, somehow, it was an elusive quality, greatness
[00:41:25] <lucky> if the language is unknown, could it, in principle, be deciphered?
[00:41:45] <lucky> (it's an open question as far as I know)
[00:41:57] <Parf> that's a turing question isn't it?
[00:43:13] <lucky> We only cracked Egyptian by having parallel translated texts.  And more importantly, by realizing its son/nephew language is still spoken
[00:43:25] <lucky> same with Maya, realizing it was related to the Mayan languages spoken still today
[00:43:40] <evolv> lucky , hahaha
[00:43:42] <Parf> a linking of histories
[00:43:59] <lucky> Sumerian via Akkadian bilingual texts, Akkadian with Old Persian, Old Persian, well we got Persian speakers today
[00:44:05] <evolv> lucky, I may have missed it, what was the association between male body hair and a red bathroom? Less or more hair?
[00:44:11] <lucky> evolv: more
[00:44:12] <evolv> 'cause I don't have a red painted bathroom, but I'd love one
[00:44:13] <Parf> so, in a sense, napoleon's acts healed the time-fractured cultural divide between one dying section of history, and the still living one
[00:44:14] <evolv> bah
[00:44:22] <evolv> I'm not hairy
[00:44:26] <Parf> hirsute
[00:44:36] <lucky> Paint your bathroom red and problem solved.
[00:44:40] <evolv> except my head, which I have to take of my impending afro soon
[00:45:52] <lucky> People who speak entirely unrelated languages, like whenever some group showed up and conquered some other... well, when you can point at something and beat them until they figure it out, it helps.
[00:46:46] <Parf> violence was the infinite language after all
[00:47:06] <lucky> But largely context-free?  I don't know if it's possible.  And if it's possible whether it's theoretically possible, or actually quite practical and if we found 150,000 tablets in an extinct language unrelated to anything else all jumbled together, we'd figure it out pretty quick.
[00:47:32] <Parf> not by ourselves, maybe
[00:47:44] <Parf> you're starting to focus on the sorts of problems we need to be looking for to solve, though
[00:50:53] <lucky> evolv: One thing that amuses me if I truncate relatively improbable generations, it soon normalizes to the selfie photo wiht the phone directly over the face (the face being one of the most variable components in the image to learn) and the other hand behind the back (hands are devillish too)
[00:50:57] <lucky> clever bastard
[00:52:02] <lucky> That technically solves the specified problem, but it's not what I wanted you to do.  Neither artificial nor intelligent. :/
[00:52:37] <Parf> once i did a mind experiment as a youth, where i tried to make a tesseract in my "imagination", but tried to do it as "materially condensed" as possible, just a sort of floating tesseract, and i came in behind myself from my ceiling, after i "passed through it", mind experiments are important for all of us to play around with shit we don't even know yet. turns out when you look at a black hole, you see behind your own head
[00:53:32] <lucky> I have trouble visualizing a cube
[00:53:40] <lucky> even squares challenge sometimes
[00:53:42] <Parf> well, not visualizing
[00:53:49] <lucky> (:
[00:53:49] <Parf> actualizing in that other space
[00:54:07] <Parf> i mean, you can't look at shit that isn't made of light, at least
[00:54:09] <lucky> visualizing might as well be the best word, actualizing it carries certain philosophical assumptions :)
[00:54:18] <Parf> ah, okay, simulating, then
[00:54:27] <lucky> Tho it may well be more neutral, visualizing has its own assumptions come to think of it
[00:54:38] <Parf> i can't look at the things i think about, in fact, eyes are sometimes quite in the way
[00:54:46] <lucky> Simulating eh, oh now we're playing with fire :)
[00:54:56] <Parf> right. so simulating, in that frequency of mind
[00:54:59] <lucky> just drop the c-word while you're at it, computing the instantiation of the structure
[00:55:03] <econo> a toy language could always be made sufficiently complex as to be indecipherable. More practically, the Linear-A corpus is of decent size but we haven't deciphered it
[00:55:17] <Parf> yes, but where this is going down is important, is what i'm trying to get at
[00:55:20] <Parf> the device itself
[00:56:18] <Parf> i did see a study somewhere recently of sort of universal language that can come down to only a few basic sounds we're all almost instantly familiar with as a human species
[00:57:26] <lucky> econo: well, I mean a naturalistic language with a pretty long corpus.  I suspect Linear A is the script used for an extinct non-IE language that the Greeks borrowed Japanese-style to cram their language's sounds into ... but it's not a huge body of text and it's definitely not a bunch of long flowing essays or anything
[00:57:34] <lucky> afaik that scenario just doesn't exist, so it can only be a hypothetical
[00:57:40] <lucky> unless you think Voynich is legit :p
[00:59:16] <lucky> Hm, still annoys me as a hypothetical.  Not sure how to approach it.  Instinct says from an information theory sense, less than traditional linguistics

[01:03:04] <Parf> haven't you heard? that's okay now. they're making monkey/human hybrid embryos
[01:03:29] <Parf> i think a few language tests that start taking over the world would be pretty rad, don't you? the pen is mightier than the sword, after all
[01:03:39] <lucky> Take a bunch of kids, raise 'em from birth with no exposure to any outside language.  Do they start speaking to each other spontaneously and develop a full naturalistic language?
[01:03:49] <lucky> Or is language a meme, to some degree?
[01:04:32] <lucky> a cognitive tool like numbers (or do we all know how to count innately too?)
[01:04:59] <lucky> heh
[01:05:15] <lucky> language tests taking over the world?
[01:07:09] <econo> I'm not sure it would be so easy to test. I know there's a criticism of universal grammar that it's unfalsifiable
[01:07:13] <lucky> There are many *partial* data points addressing these questions.  Spontaneous emergence of sign language in deaf communities of children, for example.  But that occured with children who had often been taught some form of home sign, or gestural communication and in a world of adults with language. It can't really be claimed they were hermetically sealed off from exposure to the idea of
[01:07:14] <lucky> language.
[01:07:15] <econo> though i don't recall anything beyond that
[01:07:36] <raincomplex> afaik there are specialized regions of the brain which handle language. but i'm sure there's more to learn there
[01:09:10] <lucky> And the children of people who speak a pastiche language, just basic nouns and the odd verb "me give tea now.  you tea?  want?"  kind of grammarless language used in multilingual communities when many don't speak both languages well
[01:09:32] <lucky> their kids reliably end up, usually in one generation, speaking a hybrid language with a full grammar and all the usual tenses and  pronouns and relativizers
[01:09:49] <lucky> and they often share similarities in their grammar, no less... but again, raised in a lingual environment
[01:10:16] * lucky shrugs :)
[01:10:33] <raincomplex> if i had to guess, i would say it's likely a combination of the way the brain works and cultural "technology"
[01:10:46] <raincomplex> like basically everything about humans :D
[01:10:50] <lucky> that's about my guess too, and I don't have much more detail to put to it than that, either :)
[01:11:54] <econo> to that point
[01:11:57] <econo> >In the domain of field research, the Pirahã language is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by Daniel Everett. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for recursion, including embedded clauses, as well as quantifiers and colour terms.[30] According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were
[01:11:57] <econo> simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it.[
[01:12:15] <lucky> Oh yes, I read much of it a decade plus back now
[01:12:42] <lucky> Many of the wilder claims are possibly just paucity of data (you can't exactly prove a language has no relativizer by saying, well, I haven't see one yet)
[01:12:55] <lucky> At least in that context
[01:13:14] <audrey> I sometimes wonder whether /one/ counterexample is enough to disrupt a generalization re: something like universal grammar.
[01:13:27] <Parf> so maybe we can fix this, design some sort of language that doesn't have these flaws, or loses them somehow, preemptively
[01:13:29] <audrey> The skeptical position is that the researchers have simply misunderstood Piraha.
[01:13:42] <econo> ya, that's what the rest of the paragraph states
[01:14:27] <econo> >Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar.[32] Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also
[01:14:27] <econo> stated that there was "no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either" and they provided "suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive structures".[33]
[01:15:12] <Parf> rekt
[01:15:34] <Parf> just can't escape the convergence
[01:16:16] <lucky> No relativizer would be it, audrey, IMO
[01:16:31] <lucky> I hone in on, just a feeling, that that's the whole deal, really
[01:16:49] <lucky> this sequence, it's a thought and refers to aspecific thing, and now I'm going to apply the following to that.
[01:17:09] <lucky> and just recurse forever like a Lisp hacker
[01:17:21] <Parf> that's a pretty comfy one you built
[01:17:22] <audrey> No relativizer? You mean, no recursive functionality?
[01:17:27] <lucky> but I'm also well aware my CS-ish background poisons my thinking on these things and such analogies are often very inappropriate
[01:17:38] <lucky> audrey: yes, no way to subordinate a phrase to a phrase
[01:17:52] <Parf> hey hey now, don't beat yourself up CS, counterstrike? yeah it makes demons of mighty men
[01:17:58] <audrey> I feel like Sapir-Whorf hypotheses are stretched a bit thin when it comes to oddities like Piraha
[01:18:09] <lucky> (simple conjuction works in many languages for this, of course.  it's not like they need a word or an inflection.  do they have hte *concept*?)
[01:18:09] <Parf> computer sciences, right? i'm just kidding
[01:18:24] <lucky> lol :)
[01:18:26] <audrey> just because there is no recursive functionality in the syntax does not necessarily mean the concept of recursion is alien to speakers of Piraha
[01:18:51] <audrey> It might be very difficult or impossible to convey the concept of recursion to a speaker of Piraha but I wonder if that is more of a logistical constraint than a theoretical one.
[01:19:00] <lucky> audrey: I do not see how they would be able to communicate meaningful or complex or temporally sequenced topics without having that trick
[01:19:28] <audrey> Ah, but communicating them and comprehending them are not always the same thing, right?
[01:19:33] <lucky> But the guy who has spent the most time with them claims well, thye just don't have complex ideas and they do not reason or talk much at length about relative ordering or sequencing
[01:19:36] <Parf> it would be difficult to introduce new things to the language for sure
[01:19:41] <lucky> which well, big claims
[01:19:57] <audrey> Note: My linguistic background isn´t particularly strong on this topic, I´m more of an Indo-European grammarian and etymologist, at best.
[01:20:31] <audrey> I´m wary of broad conclusions about human «universal grammar» being made from one outlier language, though.
[01:20:31] <Parf> well, would we be able to teach them english, say, do they have the same circuits, so to speak?
[01:20:33] <lucky> which appear to dissapear as people get more familiar with them.  But at the same time the Piraha are being destroyed/enlightened very rapidly by exposure to industrial global culture
[01:20:44] <Parf> or do they lack that same portion of the brain that might light up for their audio cues
[01:21:02] <Parf> let's ask the Piraha's brain
[01:21:13] <audrey> I wonder whether recursion is really so fundamentally different than, say, tenses
[01:21:24] <audrey> from the perspective of neural correlates within the context of Chomskyan universal linguistics
[01:21:25] <lucky> audrey: Well, like I said my CS background tells me something here
[01:21:42] <lucky> audrey: infinite recursion with string rewriting is a universal computer and can represent any mathematical structure or computation
[01:21:54] <lucky> tenses? they're an afterthought compared to that
[01:22:07] <lucky> but maybe thinking isn't computation
[01:22:16] <Parf> is that how you put that to words, the universal computer, infinite recursion with string rewriting
[01:22:17] <lucky> so maybe that relation is illusory
[01:22:20] <audrey> Maybe I´m flat-out wrong here. I´m just trying to establish if the difference is *qualitative* or not.
[01:22:32] <lucky> I dunno :) I have no answers to any of this, just weird questions haha
[01:22:38] <audrey> Yes, lucky, I was going to suggest that as well. Maybe the human brain isn´t really a computer in any meaningful sense to begin with.
[01:22:53] <audrey> This is just me poking around in the dark, though.
[01:23:07] <lucky> aren't we all :)
[01:23:08] * Parf hands audrey a better poking stick
[01:23:14] <Parf> get to pokin
[01:23:24] <Parf> all worms scrambling for the finish, surely
[01:23:35] <raincomplex> if you consider physics computation then thinking is computation. but thought is definitely a different flavor of computation than computers use
[01:23:41] <econo> at the very least, it seems the brain has structures that abstract away from the pure computational aspects
[01:23:54] <Parf> well that's where the machine learning comes in
[01:24:00] <lucky> econo: see, that's so very obvious to me but it's hard to prove
[01:24:24] <audrey> I´m quite skeptical of comparisons between computers and human reasoning/cognition, personally.
[01:24:43] <audrey> Anyone who´s studied the relationship of e.g. classical logic to everyday human intuition, will notice this quite readily.
[01:24:46] <Parf> surely the experience of computation wasn't just whole from the beginning, we've had to shed a lot of stuff to get here, why should we expect our consciousnesses just came of that without a lot of flaws during the process
[01:25:39] <Parf> we're running scenarios by the millions
[01:25:59] <lucky> audrey: There are two levels, I think, at which that mapping is made.  At a naive level, with our memories being RAM and our thoughts being variables and algorithms... Gah.  It is only misleading.  The universe was a spring-driven clock in the 18th and the brain was a computer in the 20th.  Coincidentally grasping for the most complex machine we had at hand to describe what seemed to be the
[01:26:01] <lucky> most complex natural thing around.
[01:26:17] <econo> Parf consciousness and reasoning does have a lot of flaws though
[01:26:22] <Parf> whole bunch of spin testing mechanisms, lots of whirring things in our brain trying to make sure everything's balanced with reality as it knows it
[01:26:29] <econo> and we tend to be extremely heuristic in our thinking
[01:26:42] <econo> actual deduction takes quite a bit of effort
[01:27:04] <Parf> exactly, econo, therefore, it would only make sense that it would be difficult to describe the universal aspect out of all of it, especially if that aspect is also its origin, it doesn't seem easy since there are all these flaws in reasoning
[01:27:34] <audrey> lucky: Yes. There is a certain «presentism», bias for the present, in these comparisons, for sure.
[01:27:47] <Parf> what does machine learning tell us, you smash a thing at the brick wall enough times but just remember you did it, and try it a little different next time, you might eventually go through the brick wall, or around it, etc
[01:27:49] <lucky> audrey: But then there's (since I mentioned it earlier, I must say it's not at all naive, and quite extraordinarily thought out :P) the idea that, well, maybe our minds are a mathematical object which exists in a Platonic sense
[01:28:06] <lucky> audrey: If this is so, then well...
[01:28:20] <lucky> that's what's meant by "the mind is a computation"

[01:28:33] <raincomplex> the human brain does calculation and storage with the same "hardware", but computers separate them
[01:29:19] <audrey> Computation ultimately involves monotonicity (closed-world reasoning), though, no?
[01:29:20] <lucky> Yes, but the structures mathematically equivalent? (Does that question make sense to pose in the first place?)
[01:29:48] <Parf> they appear to be equivalent in such a way that mathematics be damned
[01:29:59] <Parf> computation seems to have replaced mathematics
[01:30:03] <lucky> audrey: Most models of computation presume unbounded space and infinite time, which makes sense enough given the universe we live in :)
[01:30:15] <raincomplex> i think there are a lot of valid comparisons between the brain and computers. both perform comparisons, store information, query stored information
[01:30:31] <audrey> My knowledge of computing is stuck in the 1990s, though.
[01:30:33] <lucky> I really regret that they called computer science and computation what they did
[01:30:47] <lucky> Computer science has /nothing/ to do with computers :p
[01:30:48] <audrey> There´s probably enough developments in AI self-learning to disprove everything I thought I knew about computing.
[01:31:08] <Parf> it's the modernizing of philosophy, lucky, turing was a damn genius, frankly, like tesla
[01:31:21] <audrey> I always understood computers to be fundamentally deductive - input data, run data through set of algorithms/heuristics, data output.
[01:31:29] <[itchyjunk]> yeah computer science is surprisingly math
[01:31:34] <audrey> I´m guessing this is very outmoded in 2021, though. :D
[01:31:37] <[itchyjunk]> wish they had given it a math name
[01:31:46] <[itchyjunk]> i would have been more interested in theoritical comp sci then
[01:32:24] <econo> statistical methods are inherently inductive though, regardless of era
[01:32:48] <raincomplex> input/transformation/output isn't a very limited model. basically everything falls into it :D
[01:32:56] <audrey> Yeah, I´ll go back to the peanut gallery now, LOL

[01:38:59] <lucky> audrey: :) In simple terms, Turing (didn't Alonzo beat ol' Alan anyway at this?) postulated an object, the things we call computers now (both their limited physical approximations, and the mathy pure thing) can decide any logical problem for which an algorithm exists.  A function for which an algorithm exists is a computable function.

[01:40:50] <lucky> Protein folding in biology? Computable. (But not easily.) Every interaction so far described in physics, I believe.  Much of higher mathematics can be automatically reduced by encoding and derivation of algorithms to handle it

[01:41:08] <lucky> But not /everything/.  And no one reall quite knows what the limits are.
[01:41:40] <lucky> If something is a mathematical object that can be expressed in terms of sets and functions over them, for which a computable function exists, then mathematically a computer can do it.

[01:42:55] <Parf> obviously the lot should have burned, according to law
[01:44:42] <audrey> So, the idea is that everything is a mathematical object?
[01:44:58] <lucky> No, but many things, and maybe we're one of them.

[01:47:14] <lucky> I never liked the rapid fire yes's that tend to come out to those questions tho :p
[01:48:36] <lucky> (The scary insight is that, the mathematical structure which represents this subatomic-human would have many computable functions that transform it into other objects.  Like a smaller one shedding all the BS representing your genes and jeans while retaining the desired behaviour.)

[02:16:59] <Parf> that's brilliant
[02:17:43] <alguien> Summa Theologica by st. Thomas Aquinas, that is, but De Anima’s Aristotle’s and I am not a philosopher

[02:18:06] <Parf> sort of like earlier buddhist conversations
[02:18:24] <Parf> desire, clinging to the material realm is what keeps the mind from transcending

[02:19:33] <Parf> his mind simply couldn't hold the "grand universal" while enjoying hedonistic pleasures

[02:30:14] <Parf> a sort of distinction between the inherent flaws of perceiving the truth, or universal good, or whatever, cause a sort of imbalance by rule to the perfect thought, because the focus is an act of imbalancing. where a pot is part of the whole, your examination of it singles it out not in practical terms, but actual terms, and thereby doing, you limit yourself from subsisting on the wrapping of thought that is the "complete function" of thought in its entire.

[03:40:44] <audrey> lucky: I wondered about that, it´s a fairly staple teaching in Catholicism/Orthodoxy ... what if you *enjoyed* a quote-unquote «sinful» dream...
[03:41:09] <lalia> There's an Aristotle reading group going on with one of my Discord servers ATM.
[03:41:16] <lalia> I think they just started Metaphysics.
[03:41:28] <lalia> Pretty sure they already made it through Nic Ethics.
[03:51:53] <lucky> audrey: Oh, I'm not entirely sure it's correct, but first reading it seems a pretty straihtforward conclusion based on Aristotle's idea of dream perception being... unrooted sensory perception, possibly in the body, and not of internal origin.  It's no more sinful to see X in your dream than to, uh, see X in real life.  Of course anticipating hoping f or that dream, well that's a different

[18:22:20] <lalia> Right, that makes sense. :)
[18:22:54] <lalia> Since we moved our free time has been next to none. Too much going on between dealing with illnesses.
[18:23:07] <lalia> I can relate to the need to catch up.
[18:25:48] <arryana> sorry to hear it
[18:26:07] <arryana> we moved in december, and we were still far from done settling in when i left

[18:31:39] <pussipupu> I love HoPWaG, and criticising army adverts on metaphysical grounds
[18:36:10] <lalia> Haven't had gooseberries in years. They're generally tart, right?
[18:36:19] <lalia> I remember liking them, I think. :)
[18:36:47] <pussipupu> They are tart, but not so much you have to make them into jam
[18:37:06] <pussipupu> Median on the sweet tart berry scale I guess
[18:38:02] <arryana> haha
[18:38:09] <pussipupu> Ours were pretty sweet last year, but I think the new bushes are more acidic, so we'll see
[18:38:18] <arryana> oooh
[18:38:28] <pussipupu> (we still have the old bush, and it's the dominant producer yet)
[18:38:37] <arryana> awesome
[18:38:54] <pussipupu> Hopefully gooseberry and rhubarb seasons will interact enough for a nice bastard crumble
