[00:02:04] <Helmholtz> greycat, how about I use my_flag="" for false (so I can use [[ -n "$my_flag" ]] && do_flag ?)
[00:02:23] <Helmholtz> which one is more standarD?
[00:02:29] <emg> Helmholtz: did you read the tidbit?!
[00:02:38] <emg> !bool > Helmholtz
[00:02:38] <greybot> Helmholtz: Bash doesn't have boolean variables, but you can shanghai integers for this purpose, just like in C. first=1; errors=0; if ((first)); then ...; if ((! errors)); then ...; ((debug)) && log stuff
[00:02:48] <Helmholtz> emg, yeah but it uses (())
[00:02:50] <greycat> empty string for false, ok maybe, but what are you using for true?
[00:02:59] <emg> Helmholtz: yes, it does, so do that
[00:02:59] <Helmholtz> I've only seen people use [[ -n ]]
[00:03:07] <greycat> I never use that.
[00:03:23] <greycat> but if you already had a desired solution that you were planning to use, why did you bother asking us?
[00:03:27] <larryv> Helmholtz: it doesn't really matter all that much
[00:04:00] <Helmholtz> ok I'll use (()).. greycat cause people here have found best solutions for stuff
[00:04:14] <emg> no, they found solutions that happen to mostly work for what they did

[00:04:15] <greybot> The overwhelming majority of bash scripts, code, tutorials, and guides on the Internet are crap. Sturgeon was an optimist.
[00:04:35] <bls> ^ Sad but true
[00:05:07] <greycat> There are multiple solutions.  You can pick the one you like best.  You still didn't say what you're planning to use for true.  If you're just using "empty/nonempty", you can skip the -n and -z operators (they are confusing) and just use [[ $n ]] or [[ ! $n ]]

[00:30:12] <greycat> If you *can't* do this for some silly reason, the two normal workarounds for broken commands are:  (1) if the output is guaranteed to be textual (no NUL bytes), capture it with a command substitution and check the length of the captured string.  Of course that strips trailing newlines too.  (2) redirect to a temp file, and check sizefulness (test -s) of the temp file.

[00:51:01] <Dr-007> im a bash noob. right now ive got bash file with alot of functions. do the order of function matter? like when i am in a function at the bottom of a file and i call another function should the one i call be on top?
[00:51:20] <greycat> As long as the function has been defined before you call it, that's all that matters.
[00:51:41] <Dr-007> ah
[00:51:57] <Dr-007> i thought source "functions.sh" would sort that out

[00:52:09] <Dr-007> thanks
[00:52:22] <greycat> In *most* scripts, all the functions are defined before the "main part" of the script runs.  Then then "main part" of the script can call any function, and any function you happen to be in can also call any function.

[01:14:36] <craigbass76> Is it possible to (forgive my lack of proper terminology) snag the last column from a csv, and use it to make a new line ahead of each group?

[01:18:37] <greycat> Any time csv is mentioned in a question, the immediate response has to be "what KIND of csv is this", because the various means of quoting and embedding shit in csv files is fundamentally incompatible with how most people TRY to parse a csv.

[01:20:19] <kurahaupo_> chiselfuse: If you set the SECOND special variable to the current time, it will automatically track the current time for you afterwards. Then you can just use it directly in calculations. To set it initially use « printf -v SECONDS '%(%s)T' -1 »

[03:02:54] <Xanthaos> Hi. I want a way to save some keystrokes. I have several devices on a RHEL8 machine that I mount as /dev/disk/by-uuid/<UUID>. That's a lot of keystrokes, especially when these devices are manually mounted on-demand. Is there a way I can create an alias for the string value, or an environment variable, so that I can use that in the command as 'mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/d1uuid /d1mp' or 'mount
[03:02:54] <Xanthaos> /dev/disk/by-uuid/$d1uuid /d1mp' or similar?
[03:03:30] <Xanthaos> Whether it's an environment variable or an alias, it has to be permanent and persistent across reboots.
[03:03:44] *** Joins: \\Mr_C\\ (mrc@cpe-75-187-191-230.neo.res.rr.com)
[03:03:51] <hentai> Xanthaos, Just put it into whatever sourced file fits your task best
[03:04:28] <hentai> Depending on it, use /etc/profile, ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile....
[03:04:45] <greycat> This really sounds like a sysadmin problem more than a bash problem.  Are you literally *typing* those /dev/* paths by hand?  Why?  Why aren't the file systems specified in /etc/fstab, or in an automount configuration of some kind?
[03:04:56] <Xanthaos> Yes, therein lies my dilemma. I am not sure how to do this. Will I be creating an environment variable, or alias?
[03:05:06] <Xanthaos> Yes, I am manually typing the whole mount command
[03:05:13] <greycat> Why are you trying to solve this at the *shell* level?
[03:05:35] <Xanthaos> They aren't in fstab because the devices aren't always connected to the machine
[03:05:50] <greycat> You can set the "noauto" option, or something similar.
[03:06:07] <greycat> Then, when the device is plugged in, you can just "mount /foo" or whatever you named its mount point.
[03:06:33] <hentai> Xanthaos, In the sense that you want them to automount each time you reconnect them, or in that you think that having a nonexistant device in fstab will break something?
[03:07:36] <Xanthaos> Yes, I could do that. As for them automounting as soon as I connect them, that would be handy. But yes I certainly don't want fstab breaking when they're not there, as they aren't there except when I have need to access data stored on them.

[03:08:33] <Xanthaos> I have no problem manually mounting them, I would just need to shorten the UUID to something more manageable, hence an alias or a variable.
[03:08:55] <Xanthaos> Can you even do an alias of a string value?
[03:09:04] <hentai> Xanthaos, The direct answer to your question is: put "function mountuuid(){ mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/$@; }" into .bash_profile in your home directory
[03:09:10] <hentai> Should work in theory
[03:09:27] <hentai> Not nice, quite ugly, works
[03:10:16] <Xanthaos> Okay, thanks, I appreciate it :)
[03:10:20] <hentai> Replace mountuuid with whatever you want the alias to be
[03:10:53] <greycat> I pondered offering a function solution like that, but I'm guessing they want to have tab completion available as they manually type the path, and the function wouldn't permit that.
[03:10:54] <hentai> This is the easiest way around to "fulfill" the constraints of your question
[03:11:06] *** Quits: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:11:06] <greycat> I still think the best answer here is to put them in fstab with "noauto".
[03:11:25] <hentai> greycat, What if he does want the mount point to differ each time?
[03:11:37] <greycat> Then that's insane.
[03:11:47] <Xanthaos> That may well be the best solution, and the noauto will keep it from breaking when they're not there at boot time?
[03:11:55] * hentai does not like fstab for its unflexibility
[03:12:05] <Xanthaos> No, it'll be the same mount point
[03:12:20] <Xanthaos> Each device has its own mount point, which will not change
[03:12:32] <hentai> Xanthaos, Depending on your init system, it might, or might not break even if you put auto there
[03:12:41] <greycat> !os
[03:12:41] <greybot> Take it to your OS channel. Your issue is specific to your Operating System or Distribution.
[03:13:03] <greycat> I believe hentai is 100% wrong there, but I'm not the foremost expert on ALL variants of Linux, so ... OS channel.
[03:13:16] * hentai believes the opposite
[03:13:26] <Xanthaos> Okay, that sounds like its worth exploring. I'll head over to rhel. Thanks
[03:13:31] <Xanthaos> I'm using RHEL8

[03:14:31] <hentai> Xanthaos, Once again, there is a strict policy on this channel of not involving distribution-specifics
[03:15:07] <greycat> it's not that strict... it's just that we don't know *everything*, so you'll get more official answers in other places
[03:15:20] <hentai> So, my solution of setting it as a function depends only on bash and some Linux Standard Base assumptions
[03:15:52] <hentai> greycat, I thought you wanted to probe him for what he is doing, and try to fix the root of the problem.
[03:15:56] <llua> the latter not even being common among linux distros
[03:16:05] <greycat> the goal was explained well enough
[03:16:13] <Xanthaos> I'll check on that. However, it does raise an interesting question: how would I create an environment or shell variable that is again persistent and will be available to every instance of bash I have open? I have another use for this for sharing things across multiple instances of, for example, ssh, which gives me a bash shell,
[03:16:25] <greycat> by editing your dot files
[03:16:27] <greycat> !dotfiles
[03:16:27] <greybot> Set up your environment (PATH, LANG, EDITOR, ...) in ~/.bash_profile. Set up your bash shell (PS1, functions, shopts, ...) in ~/.bashrc. Then source .bashrc from .bash_profile. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>. For GUI logins, SEE YOUR DOCUMENTATION or ask your OS channel because they're all different and we don't know.

[03:17:55] <hentai> Xanthaos, So long you are not trying to "change" bash instances which were opened "before" you want to do the change, dotfiles is the way
[03:17:59] <hentai> llua, Thanks
[03:18:53] <hentai> Xanthaos, Any bash instance started before would need to source the new dotfile
[03:18:58] <Xanthaos> I guess the best way to put it is that I want the variable to be global in scope
[03:19:08] <hentai> But usually not the problem
[03:19:15] <Xanthaos> okay
[03:19:32] <hentai> Xanthaos, Each bash instance has its environment. There is no "global" scope there.

[03:20:13] <larryv> Xanthaos: that's not actually a great way to put it. you're starting to sound like you want a variable that is actually *shared* between bash instances
[03:20:28] <hentai> It is just that there are certain files bash reads into its environment on each run, unless you use very specific options like --norc, --noprofile and etc
[03:20:29] <Xanthaos> yes
[03:20:52] <larryv> i.e., where assignments propagate and such
[03:21:13] <greycat> (that is not possible)
[03:21:19] <Xanthaos> So each bash instance can access and use that variable, and as one instance changes or updates the variable, that change is visible across other instances.
[03:21:22] <hentai> Xanthaos, So if you change it in one bash, it should automatically, instantly change in all others?
[03:21:36] <greycat> Xanthaos: can't do it.
[03:21:45] <Xanthaos> oh well
[03:21:48] <hentai> Xanthaos, No, possible, but very "unbash-like" to even think about it

[03:25:54] <Xanthaos> So if I want to set a variable in windows a, SOLUTION=42, window b cannot retrieve this value, perform an operation, and change it to another value, such that window a or even window c (by window I mean individual instances of ssh or individually opened terminals, virtual terminals, etc)? the only solution for this is to store said value as a string or value in a file?

[03:26:19] <Friithian> well powerpoint is turing complete so everything is possible in it
[03:26:22] <greycat> variables are not shared between processes in that way, not even if the two processes are instances of the same program
[03:26:46] <greycat> you would need to set up Shared Memory(tm) for that to work, and that's beyond the scope of #bash
[03:27:53] <hentai> Xanthaos, Essentially, unless you are ready to rewrite bash in bash, chances are slim
[03:28:00] <Xanthaos> Okay, I can still do this by using a file. So that also means if I change the $PATH variable, that change is only effective in the one instance where I made the change, it doesn't work on any other instances?

[03:28:40] <hentai> Xanthaos, Until you source the new file, it wont
[03:28:49] <Xanthaos> I'm gonna need more alcohol lol
[03:29:06] <greycat> If the changes are just to .bashrc you can also use "exec bash" within each bash shell.
[03:29:09] <hentai> Xanthaos, You need a bigger screen - you are going to rewrite bash for all us
[03:29:53] <Xanthaos> I think the best shortterm is just use a file to store the value.
[03:29:57] <hentai> The thing is: Bash does not do anything on its own. It has no scheduling.
[03:30:02] <hentai> Xanthaos, Yes
[03:30:25] <larryv> Xanthaos: why are you even doing this

[03:54:26] <Xanthaos> (or as blu-ray's and convert them) and that's the only cost I'll incur, except when I need to expand the storage space on the server.

[06:43:09] <phy1729> https://npmpackagejsonlint.org/docs/cli appears to support multiple arguments, so just use {} +
[06:43:24] <phy1729> well if I found the right node thing
[06:44:17] <ormaaj> If you only care about distinguishing 0 vs nonzero then you can use ordinary find logic with -exec ;
[06:44:28] <greycat> or instead of mapfile and an array, you could pipe to a while IFS= read -rd '' f

[15:20:51] <Earnestly> To me that sounds like an internal detail so it wouldn't be exposed to the command-line
[15:23:53] <Helmholtz> Earnestly, but it is usable to the client. `my_script -f filter` ok this fetched the raw db and does a filer and prints some custom str to stdout. cool. What if I ALSO want the raw db? `my_script -f filter -o /tmp/outfile.json`. Is this bad design?

[15:25:13] <Earnestly> Helmholtz: I would say so.  The tool sounds like it does two discrete things that you want separate, so mine would look like: rawjson | thefilter
[15:25:19] <Earnestly> Then with that you can do anything
[15:26:04] <Earnestly> It also removes all the file handling burden from the filter that it only needs to read stdin and write stdout
[15:26:48] <Soliton> don't provide a filter just tell them jq exists. let them write the filter themselves. maximum flexibility!
[15:27:05] <Earnestly> That is the ultimate ideal, yes
[15:27:15] <Helmholtz> my script is essentially jq with a long filter
[15:27:45] <Earnestly> It almost seems like you want the initial json because you're debugging the jq filter
[15:28:42] <Earnestly> That's what I used to do when writing jq filters, I'd sometimes want the json to work on different aspects of it.  In such cases I'd just stick | tee whatever.json | inbetween my pipelines to extract the intermediate results

[15:31:22] <Earnestly> Many ways to do this without introducing new idioms
[15:31:29] <Earnestly> (or unnecessary ones)
[15:31:58] <Payam58> Hi, Inside a bash script I would like to ask for admin previliges to install applications. I can not ask them to run the script as root since the script downloads file that should nor have admin permissions. Can someone guide me to right direction?
[15:32:10] <Earnestly> I appreciate the Bell Labs idea (or MacIlroy's anyway) that flags should never be added without considering deficiencies elsewhere that is prompting it
[15:33:55] <Earnestly> Payam58: This is a bit of an OS question because bash (no posix) really deal with priviledge escalation
[15:34:21] <Earnestly> So you might have to be a bit more specific, such as the OS, what tools you have available, etc.
[15:34:38] <Earnestly> Whether dropping priviledge is possible compared with gaining priviledge, etc.
[15:34:59] <Payam58> Ubuntu Earnestly
[15:35:11] <Earnestly> You might even have pkexec
[15:35:49] <Payam58> I do a apt install blabla and then as usual it should ask for password just like installing any aplication in the terminal
[15:36:18] <Earnestly> You can use sudo
[15:36:51] <Helmholtz> Suppose I want to exit with a non-zero code if the script does not print anything to stdout. I've handled it like this: https://dpaste.com/GVW3M9FQQ    Ideas?

[15:41:15] <Helmholtz> It's at the end of the script

[15:42:24] <Helmholtz> oh
[15:42:29] <Helmholtz> I was doubting that
[15:42:48] <Earnestly> And in a pipeline this is sad because it means the next tool cannot immediately start processing the input and the former cannot immediately evict from memory that which it read

[15:43:45] <Helmholtz> So, how to handle it in a way that stream is not buffered like this?
[15:44:04] <Earnestly> You cannot, pipeline filters work on the idea of a sieve and not exit values
[15:44:29] <Earnestly> filters are written to simply handle empty inputs

[15:45:13] <Helmholtz> Earnestly, you know what was my original problem? I wanted to play and audio file if my_script returns non-empty result. folks here suggested adding a switch (like -e) which exits non-zero if result is empty. then use that logic in the next command (aplay)

[15:46:29] <Earnestly> Your code, from what I've seen, looks like you should probably be using python and not a shell
[15:46:35] <Helmholtz> like my_script | aplay. How to invoke aplay only if my_script is printing something on stdout?
[15:46:56] <Earnestly> I didn't know aplay read stdin?
[15:47:08] <Earnestly> Hm
[15:47:18] <Helmholtz> no `aplay 'sound_file'`...it does not use output
[15:47:18] <Earnestly> What does it read?  filenames?
[15:47:27] <Helmholtz> just treats my_cmd output as a flag
[15:47:34] <Earnestly> I read the manual > If filename is not specified, the standard output or input is used. The aplay utility accepts multiple filenames
[15:48:19] <Earnestly> Okay it reads the file content on stdin
[15:48:26] <Soliton> surely aplay will just not output anything then? what's the issue with that?
[15:49:08] <Earnestly> Helmholtz: If your tool isn't a filter, just do what you did.  Store the result, check if it's empty, play sound
[15:49:46] <Helmholtz> Soliton, no, the sound file is not coming from my_script. In chain `my_script | aplay "my_sound_file"` I just tream the non-empty output of my_script as a flag. So  I don't want aplay to execute if my_script is emtpy
[15:49:48] <Earnestly> (If I were a user of such a script I'd probably patch it to not play sounds because that shit is annoying)
[15:50:04] <Helmholtz> s/tream/treat
[15:50:05] <Earnestly> Helmholtz: aplay reads stdin
[15:50:20] <Earnestly> so piping your output into aplay is going to be interesting

[15:50:45] <Earnestly> Helmholtz: And in a pipe, both aplay and your script execute in parallel (i.e. at the same time)
[15:51:46] <Earnestly> Payam58: No that's a bit too basic to be asking a question like that while writing a script which does this.  If you don't know how to elevate to admin for your own case, how can you know how to do it in a script?

[16:57:15] <Helmholtz> Based on our discussions yesterday, I impemented -e switch to exit 3 if output is empty. Suppose I don't want to do this. So in chain `cmd1 | cmd2` I should check whether cmd1 prints non-empty.
[16:57:35] <Helmholtz> One solution is grep -q '.' . But this does not exclude whitespaces like "  " or "\n"

[20:00:48] <Earnestly> Tazy: Is what normal?  There's only one getopts (POSIX) that uses an optstring, eval doesn't come into play at all
[20:01:16] <Earnestly> There is a 'getopt' which is some util-linux thing that supports longopts but it is an entirely different tool
[20:01:25] <Earnestly> While getopts itself is a shell builtin
[20:01:34] <emanuele6> getopt is unusable without eval

[20:02:09] <Tazy> okay what is the standard for using getopts in a shell script. Is there an example
[20:02:13] <Tazy> emanuele6, why do you say that?
[20:02:17] <Earnestly> emanuele6: The trouble is that they're not using eval on getopt, so I'm a little unclear.  Not sure what `getopts -n' is
[20:02:52] <Earnestly> Tazy: If you have the posix manuals (on linux, man-pages), you can use `man 1p getopts' and it describes it nicely and gives you an example
[20:03:12] <Earnestly> Otherwise see https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/035
[20:03:41] <Earnestly> Tazy: The FAQ also has a good example of getopts
[20:04:10] <Tazy> Ah awesome thanks
[20:05:42] <emanuele6> util-linux's getopt(1) is meant to be used as   args=$(getopt -s bash -- optsting "$@") && eval set "$args"; it's horrible

[20:48:08] <Earnestly> The format is generally quite good so that even now man pages tend to be quite decent forms for documentation.  But many people don't understand how good they are, so it slips

[20:48:41] <Earnestly> Well, echo might call it escaping
[20:48:53] <Earnestly> As printf does, the \ means escape in that context, but quote in the shell
[20:49:04] <twkm> ewww.
[20:49:23] <Earnestly> You probably have to defend the \ in an alias like that, never tried to do that
[20:49:47] <OnlineCop> `declare -p`, `alias`, and `type` will do the same thing. In half of my systems, `set` will quote/escape those color codes correctly (and the other half, just prints them directly).

[23:51:46] <xmb> btw the exec bash works on reboot
[23:52:17] <xmb> when a hacker approaches /bin/sh it better be bash
[23:52:42] <larryv> ok. whatever that means

[23:53:29] <larryv> i'm sure changing your system's /bin/sh out from under it will never cause any issues, ever. good luck
[23:54:54] <xmb> well i see it being more near to the system, mate
[23:55:23] <xmb> what can i say, i came just across this bug: i apt-get install kexec-tools and it complains about 'restart' target not supported ( of init scripts ) oh well
[23:55:33] <xmb> i did manually remove exit 3 on those in the inits yea but still
