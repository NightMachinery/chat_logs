[03:04:44] <c705> well, your claim is "bad security". do you report bugs? have you ever developed a POC?
[03:05:19] <mlu> so, I have a startup, and some new security researchers thought they'd report a few issues even though we don't have a bug bounty program
[03:05:21] <remyabel> I like how one of those is just microsoft poorly maintaining their repos. that doesn't even have anything to do with linux
[03:05:28] <mlu> if it's a real issue, they just get a "hello, thanks"
[03:05:52] <mlu> if it's an esoteric weird case, they'd be lucky to get a response at all (or even a "bug off, we don't care")
[03:05:54] <No1x3r0> I've reported bugs; some to be rejected meritless; simply based on dislike (and no I'm not richard stallman) and I haven't been educated by anyone what a POC is.
[03:05:59] <c705> besides, the systemd bug and the glibc are both software bugs, not kernel related

[11:54:17] <jochum> zamba: theres another chance! Did you switch the Virtual Hardware?

[11:55:30] <zamba> jochum: didn't have to recreate it, no
[11:55:40] <zamba> jochum: it was happily running, but it needed a reboot since / was mounted read-only
[11:55:53] <zamba> jochum: but after the reboot, then this low graphics problem occurred :)
[11:56:23] <TJ-> loganlee: ahhh; that means it probably was advertising a different hostname, most likely it had an internal conflict resolution when its interface was dropped and restarted, so it will add a number to the hostname, e.g. swift-1 then swift-2 and that is why you couldn't reach it as swift
[11:56:25] <jochum> zamba: ok, one way that "might" fix it is chrooting in the box and do "apt update; apt upgrade"

[20:00:19] <octav1a> Hello, I have a job running in a grid manager that logs progress to a text file. It does a thing where there is a line like (100/2000), and then prints a \r to overwrite the line with the next progress, so it all appears on one line. I want to get the current progress. The problem is that using tail or cat on the file I see it just scroll past all the progress and the line vanishes before I can read it. How can I basically see the last line before the \r

I'm using LUKS for both my rootfs as well as SWAP, and managed to get it bypassed on my rootfs with a grub param, but I'm not sure what to do about SWAP. I've already set up luks,no-read-workqueue,no-write-workqueue in my crypttab for it, but it doesn't seem to have any effect.

[20:15:53] <ann-a> cAMP: yes during the 2nd install, when I got to the Grub portion of the install it said "there seems to be no existing other OS, do you want to use boot disk" I said "no" ; then chose "sda" where the OS was installed but then it would not boot
[20:15:55] <cAMP> ann-a: well I suppose one could think of hierarchy. The boot disk should have boot manager that recognizes all OS installs. One can do it from BIOS. Basically I'm saying Windows installers may not respect your grub. For other combos perhaps one can do a websearch.

SELinux would be used for high security environments where you have a dedicated team to maintain the complex configurations - now you can use SELinux in "targeted" mode,  I wonder if that is comparable to apparmor, preventing mainly things like buffer overflow
