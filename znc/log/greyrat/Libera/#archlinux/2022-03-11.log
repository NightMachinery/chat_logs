[06:21:20] <Ghosthree3> well, default is probably as 'global' as you're going to get. is the default not changing when you plug in headphones/bt or w.e? as a hack work around you could chain two pactl commands together with ; and specify both sinks explicitly i guess

[13:17:02] <tbreslein> weird. since i'm guessing you are trying to install arch, have you just tried installing it with one of those older isos? most (if not all) packages are downloaded fresh from the repos anyways during the install process, so it could "just work"
[13:17:33] <Nemo9> yeah i did install from those older versions
[13:17:44] <Nemo9> but the problem is with mirrors
[13:17:46] <tbreslein> obviously, only do that if you are okay with possibly breaking something (though this sounds like a notebook resurrection)

[23:52:25] <thurstylark> also, if you want the most recent version, why not build vcvrack-fundamental-git?
[23:53:04] <copygirl> Mm it wants me to build vcvrack a second time from source.
[23:53:12] <copygirl> Or at least download it.
[23:53:22] <thurstylark> what does?
[23:53:25] <BrainDamage> copygirl: have you tried cardinal?
[23:53:30] <CarloWood> I read two things online just now: on one page someone says that libRack.a "1" is a stub needed just on Mingw - but "2" would be needed everywhere.  And somewhere else I read that plugins need to be linked against libRack because they don't have the right symbols or something otherwise.

[23:53:41] <copygirl> vcvrack-fundemental still builds the plugin but uses the SDK instead of building with Rack's source code.
[23:53:48] <CarloWood> It was all very unclear.
[23:53:53] <BrainDamage> it's vcv rack with a selection of open source plugins bundled in
[23:54:10] <BrainDamage> no external plugin support to not clash with the orig project
[23:54:14] <copygirl> BrainDamage: I have not and that sounds lovely.
[23:54:30] <BrainDamage> it's in the main repos, so no pain

[23:55:09] <BrainDamage> vcv upstream is kinda hostile to packaging solutions, so this was thought as workaround
