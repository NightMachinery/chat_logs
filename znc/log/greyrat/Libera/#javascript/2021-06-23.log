[08:11:19] <deltab> this.activeNotes  gets just the function by itself, losing the link to 'this'
[08:11:40] <deltab> use  () => this.activeNotes()
[08:11:58] <wroathe> Or switch to function components
[08:13:11] <Croves> deltab can you tell me why this does not happen with addNote for example?
[08:14:40] <deltab> because you're using  () => this.addNote(this.state)  which has 'this' and the call together
[08:15:16] <deltab> o.m()  is not the same as  f = o.m; f()

[09:35:11] <ashnur> class components are fine in the same way spam over mail is 'fine'. it has a purpose and it fulfills that purpose perfectly, but it takes extraordinary manual effort to accomplish and to maintain that purpose. maybe there is a better way?
[09:35:42] <ljharb> no, they're actually fine.
[09:35:48] <ashnur> that's what i said
[09:35:50] <ljharb> plenty of cases are better as SFCs with hooks
[09:35:55] <ljharb> spam over mail isn't fine in any way.
[09:35:58] <ljharb> class components are fine.
[09:36:08] <ljharb> most class components do not take much manual effort.
[09:37:04] <ashnur> most spam mail also do not require much manual effort, but overall, and especially when it comes to cleaning up
[09:37:07] <ashnur> they do
[09:37:37] <ljharb> ok but that's still not a good comparisopn
[09:37:43] <ljharb> all spam mail is bad. most class components aren't.
[09:38:01] <ljharb> comparing them to spam is just trying to quietly imply that they're bad too
[09:38:01] <ashnur> not all spam mail is bad.
[09:38:07] <ljharb> yes, all of it is. without exception.
[09:38:13] <ashnur> :)
[09:38:15] <ljharb> the word "spam" wouldn't apply if it weren't bad
[09:38:21] <ljharb> then it'd just be an advertisement or something
[09:38:31] <ljharb> the definition of "spam" includes that it's bad.
[09:38:37] <ashnur> it's not black and white, spam is low quality, mass produced
[09:39:22] <ljharb> that is also what it is. but it is black and white in that it's all bad.
[09:39:32] <ljharb> there is nothing good called "spam"; the word itself only has a negative connotation.
[09:39:44] <ljharb> (well, the meat is ok, but nothing digital called spam is good)

[09:40:12] <ljharb> actual spam is decent
[09:40:13] <ashnur> no, but sometimes some of the info you get through spam is good, despite the medium
[09:40:15] <ljharb> digital spam never is
[09:40:21] <ljharb> ashnur: ok but that doesn't make the spam any less bad

[09:42:59] <ljharb> that doesn't mean class components aren't good for other things - they're good for manny things.
[09:43:23] <ljharb> there's definitely some SFCs + hooks that are objectively cleaner as class components - altho the majority is subjective, i realize.
[09:43:29] <ashnur> a blunt knife is good for many things, just not for the purpose the knife was made for
[09:43:35] <gehn> as much as I advocate against using classes in general, they're fine for react components
[09:43:46] <ljharb> ashnur: class components were made for what they do.
[09:43:49] <ashnur> saying "good for many things" is so vague, it's true for anything
[09:43:50] <ljharb> exactly
[09:43:59] <ljharb> classes in general are usually terrible; react class components aren't.
[09:44:10] <gehn> UI components are a good use case for the need to encapsulate data and behavior
[09:44:12] <ljharb> ashnur: java isn't good for many things. neither is mongodb.
[09:44:17] <ashnur> not unless people use it for composing stateful behavior
[09:44:27] <ashnur> lol, java is not good for anything
[09:44:29] <gehn> also, state
[09:44:32] <ashnur> now you went and done it
[09:44:34] <ljharb> ashnur: exactly
[09:44:41] <ljharb> ashnur: so it's not true for anythign :-p
[09:44:48] <ljharb> but yes, let's please not get ashnur started on state
[09:44:50] <gehn> you have an <input> (or something), you need behavior on that input, you also need to track its state, and possibly other state related to it
[09:45:00] <gehn> but you ideally don't want any of that bleeding out into the rest of your code
[09:45:05] <gehn> a class is a good tool for that
[09:45:40] <ashnur> afaik java virtual machine is way better than javascript vm
[09:45:49] <gehn> also you don't want to just store that state in the DOM, like on data-foo="..." attributes
[09:46:04] <ljharb> ashnur: questionable. but defensible.
[09:46:10] <gehn> ashnur, you'd have to define better

[09:46:42] <gehn> ljharb, excepting that the JVM begat things like Clojure and Scala, I agree
[09:46:44] <ashnur> usefulness is about what people do with it anyway, saying not good for anything is saying not useful, it's clearly either you want to annoy people who like java or you want to redefine the meaning of common words
[09:46:49] <gehn> the JVM itself is okay-ish, Java not so much
[09:46:58] <ljharb> i mean, still meh
[09:47:07] <ljharb> nothing on the jvm seems to be able to differentiate a char and an int
[09:47:15] <ashnur> you would convince me sooner that cobol is not good for anything, and actually lots of important stuff runs on cobol still
[09:47:27] <gehn> ljharb, hmm I wasn't aware of this
[09:47:35] <ashnur> it's like saying windows is not good for anything when nuclear reactors run on it :D
[09:47:47] <gehn> but there's little difference between char and uint8_t in C++
[09:47:50] <ljharb> gehn: try it, even in scala
[09:47:52] <gehn> in fact they are aliases of each other iirc
[09:47:55] <ljharb> gehn: yes but conceptually there is always a different
[09:48:03] <gehn> though that has changed now with the introduction of std::byte
[09:48:05] <ljharb> gehn: 32 and 'a' are not the same thing (or whatever number it is)
[09:48:34] <ashnur> it's like saying police giving speeding tickets is not good for anything when lots of police feeds his family extra meals from that money
[09:48:35] <gehn> it is admittedly dumb that C and C++ both call an 8 bit int a char
[09:48:35] <ljharb> gehn: any api that accepts an int where i can pass `'x'` is just broken
[09:48:49] <ljharb> ashnur: it's still not good for anything
[09:48:55] <gehn> ljharb, you should be able to enforce that in C++ by adding the `explicit` keyword I believe
[09:49:00] <gehn> no idea wrt Java tho
[09:49:04] <ljharb> ashnur: cops get paid even if they give no speeding tickets at all. they just get less of a bonus.

[09:50:12] <ljharb> i'd rather use perl than java

[09:50:25] <kirch> javascript is a flavor of ocaml :rofl:
[09:50:25] <gehn> hmm, on that one I'm undecided, I'm really not a fan of perl
[09:50:34] <ashnur> i would probably use clojure too, not java, but it's the same
[09:50:47] <ashnur> using clojurescript for frontend doesn't change the vm
[09:51:00] <gehn> but it does change your approach to problem solving
[09:51:04] <gehn> which has value in and of itself
[09:51:41] <gehn> the main thing perl has going for it is that it's commonly installed by default already on many linux distros

[09:51:53] <ljharb> i'd rather use brainfuck than java

[09:53:49] <ashnur> it kinda does
[09:53:54] <gehn> kirch, given that Eich stated that Scheme was an original inspiration, JS isn't too far off, in some ways at least
[09:54:21] <ashnur> it's the difference between "i will hit you and it will hurt" and "i will hit you so that your head will be spinning on the top of your neck"
[09:54:36] <ljharb> in both cases it will hurt
[09:54:40] <gehn> how are those particularly different?
[09:54:40] <kirch> I was just reading https://wiki.c2.com/?JavaScript and having a good laugh
[09:54:55] <ashnur> i know you want to hurt me, but the second case is not something i can worry about
[09:55:08] <kirch> I've noticed that hitting people hurts your hand, too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:55:16] <ljharb> ashnur: not literally
[09:55:18] <gehn> if a drunk person at a bar said either of those things to me, I'd be equally wary
[09:55:27] <ljharb> ashnur: but this is human communication, why does literalness matter at all
[09:55:46] <ljharb> in fact, the hyperbole in that case would make it *more* dangerous
[09:55:49] <ashnur> it's not about literalness
[09:55:53] <ljharb> because people use hyperbole to convey the intensity of their emotions
[09:55:57] <ashnur> sorry if it was not clear
[09:56:06] <ljharb> the latter example is someone who wants to hit you and is REALLY MAD ABOUT IT
[09:56:21] <gehn> kirch, see this is what people get wrong about bare knuckle boxing. some might argue it's actually safer. it's why you traditionally see those really old school pictures of boxers with their arms down low
[09:56:21] <ljharb> that's critical information to infer
[09:56:24] <ashnur> my point is, you can go so far with your hyperbole that you hurt your actual meaning
[09:56:29] <ljharb> ashnur: i don't agree
[09:56:34] <gehn> hitting a persons face, you're as liable to break your hand as you are to hurt them
[09:56:34] <ljharb> ashnur: well, i suppose it's possible
[09:56:38] <ashnur> you don't agree that you can go so far?
[09:56:39] <ashnur> :D
[09:56:39] <ljharb> ashnur: but not in your or my examples
[09:56:40] <gehn> so historical boxers mostly went for body shots
[09:56:48] <ashnur> java is not good for anything
[09:56:54] <ljharb> ashnur: and that doesn't mean hyperbole isn't effective. it just means that, like anything, it has limits
[09:57:00] <ljharb> yes, that is fine hyperbole that does not go too far
[09:57:01] <ljharb> fuck java
[09:57:03] <ashnur> is not a statement that has any information other than 'ljharb hates java'
[09:57:07] <gehn> I think Alan Kay said it well
[09:57:07] <kirch> gehn: it's safer because the fights are shorter and don't involve an extra pound (or whatever) of glove
[09:57:23] <ljharb> ashnur: perhaps that's all i wanted to convey

[10:01:07] <ljharb> in theory yes

[10:01:31] <ljharb> *legitimizing
[10:01:45] <ashnur> depends how popular the ideology or the hype train carrying the thing is
[10:02:17] <ljharb> this is like, seven levels of meta on top of "class components are as bad as spam"
[10:02:21] <gehn> about the only thing still giving Java legitimacy is Minecraft
[10:02:30] <gehn> and they've even completely reimplemented it in C++ for Windows 10
[10:02:35] <ljharb> maybe let's dial it back to, not using intellectually dishonest ways to describe class components
[10:02:45] <ashnur> maybe it's not a layer cake
[10:04:54] <ashnur> and there is a difference between "B is as 'fine' as A" or you seeing that you don't like A, translating immediately into something i didn't say: "B is as bad as A"
[10:05:26] <gehn> the only real question that matters: is it as bad as ashnur's face?

[10:05:57] <ashnur> I have a nice phrase I used to mention a couple of times when it comes to this: A random person and a random rock lying on the ground have more in common than how much difference there is between any random two people.
[10:06:14] <gehn> sounds like hyperbole
[10:06:24] <ljharb> wtf does that even mean
[10:06:42] <gehn> translation "people are so differnet, wow, lmao!"
[10:06:53] <ashnur> people with the wrong kind of thinking can't make sense of that sentence because they are unable to break the compartimentalization of different thoughtpatterns

[10:17:13] <gehn> but that also says little about what else is in the model
[10:17:31] <gehn> "model" has a pretty good definition in maths at least
[10:17:37] <ashnur> ...
[10:17:49] <gehn> it's a bit abstract, but it's not what I would call "very vague"
[10:17:57] <ashnur> but i am not writing a dissertation. i wrote an english sentence, not mathematical prose
[10:18:04] <gehn> in computers it could be ambiguous, but after disambiguation it's pretty precise
[10:18:06] <ashnur> it's not in terms of sets

[10:18:21] <gehn> we use math in our english sentences all the time
[10:18:37] <ashnur> that's right, YOU use it if you want, I don't

[10:19:43] <Maxdamantus> Sets are all fine and well, as long as you don't think about sets that don't contain themselves.
[10:19:57] <ashnur> lol
[10:20:03] <ashnur> finite sets are fine
[10:20:21] <ashnur> easier to say it like that, it also contains that it's not recursive, since those are not finite
[10:20:47] <ashnur> and i like math, but i don't do math every time i talk about numbers or counting or measurement
[10:21:05] <ashnur> that would be like saying that everyone who touches a potato is making fries, just don't realize it

[10:33:39] <ljharb> what's british for "like and subscribe"
[10:33:44] <ashnur> lol
[10:33:49] <ashnur> Curry is an anglicised form of the Tamil word kaṟi meaning 'sauce' or 'relish for rice' that uses the leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii)
[10:33:54] <ljharb> "tip tip and heave to, lads!"
[10:34:04] <ashnur> so if you mean asian sauce food, curry is not british
[10:34:04] <ljharb> ashnur: sure, the word. but the food is legit.
[10:34:29] <ashnur> if you mean curry the dish, you will be talking about something that almost no asians eat at home, just very similar stuff
[10:34:40] <ljharb> i know plenty of indian people that eat curry at home.
[10:34:44] <ashnur> it's subtle. i watch too many cooking channels :D
[10:35:04] <ashnur> i meant home in asia, where the food originates from
[10:35:24] <ashnur> not home in america in their apartment where they order food like anyone else
[10:35:36] <gehn> through no fault of my own, for some reason brits and canucks seem to dominate youtube
[10:35:47] <ljharb> i'm quite confident people in india eat curry, not infrequently
[10:36:00] <ljharb> "asia" is too large an area to generalize
[10:36:02] <gehn> computerphile being a good example, <3 computerphile
[10:36:13] <gehn> also numberphile and their other affiliations
[10:36:22] <ashnur> they eat dishes we would recognize as curry, but they think of it in different terms and the food is subtly different
[10:36:39] <ashnur> western curry is more to the stomach of western people
[10:36:40] <ljharb> ashnur: then it's still curry
[10:36:48] <ljharb> ashnur: regional differences don't make it not curry
[10:36:50] <gehn> ashnur, japan's industrial boxed curry market would like to disagree
[10:37:04] <ljharb> ramen is ramen even tho japan ramen is different than US ramen
[10:37:11] <ashnur> no one said it wasn't curry :D
[10:37:12] <ljharb> boba is boba even tho taiwan boba is different than US boba
[10:37:17] <ljharb> you said that
[10:37:19] <gehn> well, japan ramen isn't necessarily different
[10:37:21] <ashnur> no, i didn't
[10:37:22] <ljharb> by implying it was the same as fortune cookies
[10:37:25] <ashnur> lol
[10:37:29] <ljharb> which are a completely american invention
[10:37:29] <gehn> japan also has cup noodles

[10:37:36] <ljharb> gehn: sure. and those are the same, at least
[10:37:38] <ashnur> fortune cookies are not fortune cookies because they are invented in america?

[10:37:43] <ljharb> *flavors
[10:37:44] <ashnur> what weird logic you get there
[10:37:45] <gehn> and there are plenty of "real ramen" restaraunts in NYC for example
[10:37:56] <ljharb> ashnur: no, fortune cookies aren't "chinese food" because china doesn't generally have them

[14:21:10] <Ellipsis753> If I try it with 10,000 it takes 100ms. But 100,000 takes 9000ms (rather than the expected 1000ms if it was linear).

[14:36:06] <Maxdamantus> Ellipsis753: because it has to scan through all the 'a's from each position in the string.
[14:36:39] <Maxdamantus> Ellipsis753: from position 0, it scans through 10000 'a's, from position 1 it scans through 9999 'a's, from position 2 it scans through 9998 'a's, etc.
[14:37:15] <Maxdamantus> so in general, from position `n`, it scans through `10000 - n` 'a's.
[14:37:27] <Ellipsis753> Maxdamantus: Oh. Why does it scan all the "a"s each time?
[14:37:46] <Ellipsis753> I kind of assumed it'd be a tree, and after 10,000 a's failed it'd backtrack just one element in the tree and try again.

[14:38:47] <Maxdamantus> Ellipsis753: graphically, you can think of it as a triangle: the base of the triangle represents position 0 and the tip of the triangle represents position 10000, and the area of the triangle is going to be base/2*height, or 10000/2*10000

[14:41:35] <Maxdamantus> Ellipsis753: a backtracking-based regex engine is one that starts a subexpression of the regex at each position.
[14:42:28] <Maxdamantus> Ellipsis753: the more alternative way involves not backtracking, where you maintain multiple matcher states as you walk through the input.
[14:45:15] <Maxdamantus> though actually, the alternative way will also be quadratic in this case.
[14:45:35] <Ellipsis753> Maxdamantus: Isn't it possible to backtrack just one "a" instead of all of them?
[14:46:19] <Maxdamantus> Ellipsis753: not really, because you're thinking of shifting the starting position.
[14:46:45] <Maxdamantus> Ellipsis753: if you shift the starting position, that involves extra logic. You're not doing the same match anymore.
[14:46:57] <Ellipsis753> Ohhhhh.
[14:46:59] <Maxdamantus> it only works in this case because all of the previous input must have been 'a's.
[14:47:08] <Maxdamantus> that doesn't generalised.
[14:47:15] <Maxdamantus> s/d.$/./
[14:47:15] <Ellipsis753> I see. Sorry, misread what you wrote before because I wasn't thinking straight.
[14:47:52] <Ellipsis753> So the quadratic nature comes from shifting the start forwards each time. Not from matching fewer than the maximum number of "a"s.
[14:47:57] <Ellipsis753> Makes sense.
[14:48:06] <Ellipsis753> Thank you for explaining that to me.

[17:54:23] <entuland> lazy loading without setting the image dimensions look like a bad idea, as you'd likely get page reflowing / rearranging
[17:54:31] <entuland> how can't you know the dimensions of the images?
[17:54:45] <jwpapi> okay Cork min-height helps me a bit, but there is an icon on it that I don’t want to display before the image is loaded

[18:07:12] <entuland> is it doing what you want?
[18:07:32] <jwpapi> and the plugin jquery file had a method `onload` for the images which I manipulated to display the little icon on the bottom right only once the image is loaded.

[20:49:00] <cthulchu_> my wonderful folks, in an event listener, how do I typically get access to the event's payload if I only have this and this is the element against which I'm firing the event?
[20:49:30] <cthulchu_> I mean, I can get event.target. can I get to event from target tho?
[20:50:52] <GreenJello> there's a global 'event', at least in some browsers
[20:53:19] <austincheney> cthulchu_, what do you mean by event payload?  the payload is the event object
[20:53:45] <cthulchu_> no
[20:54:18] <cthulchu_> CustomEvents can have payload with them

[21:06:53] <wroathe> Croves: Figure it out yet?
[21:08:11] <austincheney> ljharb, actually, I really don't care what the logic is of the proposed dom method.  My only problem is that this is a useful capability (I have been using it for 9 years) and nobody (I mean NOBODY) is using treewalker.
[21:09:54] <austincheney> when you search for createTreeWalker in Github there are less than 200 results for JavaScript and TypeScript combined.  When you search for getNodesByType there about 6500 results and getNodesByType isn't even a real thing yet
[21:10:34] <wroathe> austincheney: Could it be that you're one of a very small group of people who have a need for something like that generally? And that has something to do with why createTreeWalker isn't widely known about?
[21:10:43] <austincheney> it reminds me of getElementsByClassName as before that was a thing class where only for applying css to HTML.
[21:11:18] <austincheney> back around 2008 nobody had a need for fetching elements by classes, because there wasn't a convenient way to do

[21:13:55] <Croves> wroathe Not yet, but I have changed my code since last question
[21:14:15] <Croves> I figured out I should store the list of items inside state and use setState to update it

[21:17:34] <wroathe> austincheney: It's apples to oranges when talking about additions to the Element APIs.
[21:17:57] <austincheney> wroathe, then consider a case where you want to quickly gather all data attributes using a single function call.  How would you do it?
[21:17:59] *** Joins: silly (~silly@user/silly)
[21:18:25] <wroathe> austincheney: I'd probably wrap that createTreeWalker thing in a call that does what I want
[21:18:37] <wroathe> austincheney: But certainly an argument could be made for adding a function for that too
[21:19:02] <austincheney> or just .getNodesByType("attribute")... success
[21:19:53] <wroathe> austincheney: What would be the use of such a thing though? Typically you need to know *which* data attribute on *which* element you're dealing with to know how to handle the data within.
[21:20:09] <wroathe> austincheney: Maybe tooling for auditing server-rendered data?
[21:20:16] *** Quits: Zixon (~Zixon@user/zixon) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:20:43] <austincheney> wroathe, since a node list of nodes is returned each index has a parentNode property that tells you what the element is.

[21:21:10] <wroathe> Ah, right. Second question still stands.

[21:22:50] <austincheney> wroathe, it opens access to the document in ways that I personally use for all kinds of tooling, but it is hard to imagine how other people might use it.  Right now every other DOM method is only for accessing elements, which limits all kinds of possibilities
[21:23:12] <austincheney> again, circa 2008 nobody had any reason or use for finding elements by class names

[22:52:52] <wroathe> The main differences there are that they error if there's no provider available, which screws up this "pure" component unit testing thing I'm going for (and runs counter to how contexts are supposed to work generally), and this uses a Map instead of a linked list to maintain subscriptions from descendant components

[22:53:52] <wroathe> And they use this convoluted Subscription class to maintain a tree of Subscriptions, even though they're not actually using it like a tree (at the end of the day they all just end up registering the handler they provided with the root Subscription)
[22:54:42] <wroathe> So this adds a useSubscription hook that registers a callback in that Map in the context, and then removes the handler on unmount
[22:54:50] <wroathe> And the other hooks are built in terms of that hook

[22:57:19] <wroathe> (well, the other Redux hooks, anyway)
[22:58:16] <wroathe> I'm going to add the ability to benchmark state comparisons between calls to dispatch() and report that out to console
[22:58:51] <em> three.js fully justifies the existence of javascript, everything else that javascript does or can do is just a lucky side effect.
[23:02:06] <wroathe> Also, part of the goal of working on this was to solidify my understanding and opinion of hooks. If you take this hardline stance, like I have, that all hooks should just provide defaults that props can override, then HoCs become the final form here. I left the hooks in the components, but if I were to move them into HoCs, there wouldn't be a need for the useDefaults hook, because you could just do
[23:02:12] <wroathe> the ({ foo = 'default1', bar = 'default2' }) syntax to provide your defaults (after the hooks have been called)

[23:08:17] <wroathe> All event objects get $dispatch, $getState, and $context added to them. This basically makes each event handler into it's own separate main routine that has access to the global redux state, dispatch actions to modify that state, and has a context object to use as a scratch pad for storing promises and other DOM handles between event handlers.

[23:13:02] <systemfault> quesker: The modern way is to use an arrow function for the setTimeout
[23:13:21] <systemfault> Arrow functions use their parent scope's "this"
[23:13:27] <quesker> ah
[23:13:47] <systemfault> Else, the old way: setTimeout((function() {}).bind(this), 1000)
