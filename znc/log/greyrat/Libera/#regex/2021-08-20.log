[09:54:50] <re101-mau-52> could you help on extracting the GST number only in the above input string
[09:56:44] <re101-mau-52> the asterisk showing here in grey are actually spaces
[09:57:06] <VectorX> can you see if this works for you, (?<=GSTIN\/UIN No: +?)\w+
[10:03:00] <re101-mau-52> VectorX, i want the number in front of GSTIN no
[10:03:24] <re101-mau-52> i want to extract the value not the field name
[10:03:46] <VectorX> right, is that not giving it ?
[10:03:58] <VectorX> did you try it?
[10:06:52] <VectorX> if not might aswell go with "GSTIN\/UIN No: +(\w+)"  and then access the value from the Groups
[10:09:31] <re101-mau-52> (?<=GSTIN\/UIN No: +?)\w+ 
[10:09:49] <re101-mau-52> this is showing the output here in the substitution console

[10:10:09] <re101-mau-52> ?
[10:10:19] <re101-mau-52> please check
[10:10:34] <VectorX> that wont work on the regex101 site, you have to run it in your program
[10:16:10] <re101-mau-52> but we can test the expression only here right as we did earlier with digitok
[10:16:18] <re101-mau-52> digitok
[10:18:17] <VectorX> re101-mau-52 you have to use a .net tester or run it in your code
[10:18:44] <VectorX> ie, go to say http://regexstorm.net/tester
[10:19:07] <VectorX> then paste this without the quotes in the Pattern "(?<=GSTIN/UIN No: +?)\w+"
[10:19:15] <VectorX> and paste your sample data in the Input field

[18:39:17] <JohnDoe2> Guest2608 what do you need regex to do?
[18:39:41] <Guest2608> i need to just select till first number
[18:40:02] <JohnDoe2> meaning /api/members/ ?
[18:40:15] <JohnDoe2> is any of that variable?
[18:40:37] <Guest2608> yup just need to select till /api/members/1234
[18:41:03] <JohnDoe2> Guest2608 is the idea to replace /api/members with something else?
[18:41:32] <JohnDoe2> Guest2608 https://regex101.com/r/cFbr8e/2
[18:41:33] <Guest2608> no i just need to select /api/members/1234
[18:41:52] <JohnDoe2> Guest2608 that's what your initial regex was doing - what wasn't working about it?
[18:41:57] <Guest2608> u hvnt select till number
[18:42:20] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/cFbr8e/3
[18:43:23] <Guest2608> my regex selected /api/members/1234/store/22
[18:43:33] <Guest2608> i need till /api/members/1234
[18:43:37] <JohnDoe2> not the one you shared with me
[18:44:06] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/cFbr8e/1 - that's your initial regex and it stops at /api/members/1234
[18:45:13] <Guest2608> but it is not working properly
[18:45:31] <Guest2608> it wasnt stopped till /api/members/1234
[18:45:58] <JohnDoe2> you were probably testing with a different regex
[18:47:20] <Guest2608> what is used to stop 
[18:49:04] <JohnDoe2> there isn't a stop command, but you can "simulate" it with a lookahead like I did in /2 and /3. The idea is to place whatever you expect to come next in the (?= ... ) group
[18:49:36] <JohnDoe2> but an even smarter way is to only match what you need
[18:50:06] <Guest2608> ohk

[20:50:29] <berber> how can i regex a string, say "string", that is not preceeded by a "#", anywhere before it?  like not immediately before it, but anywhere before it.  for example, with input "fsdjkafjk jkdfs # fdssdf string jfkdjkfd", i want it to not match anything, but with input "jfkdsjfksd string # jfkdsjk jkjdfks" i want it to match something
[20:52:16] <berber> the first input shouldn't match because the only occurence of "string" has the character "#" somewhere before it, but the second input should match because "string" has no "#" preceding it anywhere
[20:59:40] <JohnDoe2> berber by somewhere you mean " on the same line" ?
[21:00:11] <JohnDoe2> berber what flavor regex are you working with?
[21:01:42] <OnlineCop> berber: If using PCRE, I usually use this: `#.*(*SKIP)(*F)|string`
[21:01:42] <JohnDoe2> berber https://regex101.com/r/p4x3r5/1 with the assumption that you mean "on the same line"
[21:02:46] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/p4x3r5/2 reuses ^ JD2's inputs and uses the (*SKIP)(*F).

[21:04:23] <OnlineCop> I use this with `grep -P` all the time as reused variables: one to exclude text within "double quotes", another to exclude text after '#' or '//' line-comments, another to exclude text within """...""" or '''...''' or /* ... */ blocks, etc.

[21:05:43] <OnlineCop> (Although matching multi-line blocks is usually a headache because normal grep won't do multiple lines without `-z` which makes `-n` [line number] always report line #1.)

[21:08:09] <JohnDoe2> missing a 7 there
[21:08:12] <JohnDoe2> re101-turkey-52 ask away please
[21:08:41] <OnlineCop> What's the difference between `perl -0` and `perl -077`?
[21:08:50] <OnlineCop> I've always used the former, but don't know the differenc.e
[21:09:08] <re101-turkey-52> i am having trouble understanding how  to use the right forms 
[21:09:28] <JohnDoe2> probably none, I don't know how I got stuck with the triple 7
[21:09:30] <OnlineCop> re101-turkey-52: Have you got a link to an example you're working on?
[21:12:58] <re101-turkey-52> not really anything inperticuler
[21:13:47] <OnlineCop> It helps if you have some text (replace any personal/private info with generic text) and explain what you're trying to do.
[21:14:52] <OnlineCop> For example, are you matching specific words in a document? IP addresses? Passwords? Having some starting/sample text would be useful.
[21:15:42] * JohnDoe2 ð¨âð¦¯
[21:15:44] <berber> JohnDoe2:  thanks!
[21:16:01] <berber> i meant beginning of line, but whatever the case, i could change that by using the global tag or not
[21:16:18] <JohnDoe2> no, that would be /s
[21:16:27] <JohnDoe2> and remove /m
[21:16:27] <berber> ah whoops
[21:16:30] <berber> yes
[21:16:32] <berber> sry
[21:16:37] <JohnDoe2> then ^ means beginning of document (whole input)
[21:16:39] <berber> the m tag i meant
[21:16:50] <JohnDoe2> and .+ will match across line terminators too due to /s
[21:17:02] <berber> yes well i provided two inputs that didn't contain any newline character, so it doesn't matter in my case
[21:17:11] <berber> (or does it?)
[21:17:35] <OnlineCop> @berber: Do you want this to match: "foo bar STRING baz baf # comment STRING comment"
[21:17:38] <JohnDoe2> cool well we're here if you need future adjustments but be warned the .+ at the end, with /s will match all 300 GB of the file :)
[21:18:46] <re101-turkey-52> so what do i have to sdo to get a file to load
[21:19:03] <JohnDoe2> re101-turkey-52 copy-paste, there's no upload
[21:19:05] <OnlineCop> re101-turkey-52: Your question doesn't appear to be related to regex...
[21:19:08] <berber> OnlineCop yes
[21:19:54] <OnlineCop> berber: Throw a few more examples into both version /1 and /2 of the above regex101 page that contain "string" in various positions. If either works better for you, use that one.
[21:20:35] <OnlineCop> If you're not using PCRE, I'd go with version /1 if it works in all your expected edge cases.
[21:20:54] <berber> OnlineCop indeed, it does not match when it contains both.  like the way you wrote it
[21:21:04] <berber> with string before and after the # symbol
[21:21:04] <OnlineCop> If you're using ECMAScript (like in vscode), you could also try (?<!#.*)string
[21:24:16] <berber> OnlineCop:  I am using python regex
[21:24:36] <berber> (but not python)
[21:24:39] <OnlineCop> If you `import regex` instead of `import re`, the 'regex' module allows PCRE.
[21:24:47] <OnlineCop> Ah, I see.
[21:25:13] <berber> i am trying to have a python regex in an ansible yaml file.  ansible uses python regex
[21:25:43] <OnlineCop> Switching the FLAVOR to Python on regex101 should show (*SKIP) and (*F) to be invalid.
[21:25:52] <berber> yes
[21:26:34] <berber> and your suggestion (?<!#.*)string also doesn't work
[21:26:54] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/p4x3r5/3
[21:27:10] <berber> it feels like not too crazy of a use case.  i want to match all lines that contain "string", but not commented.
[21:27:38] <berber> OnlineCop:  yes!  that looks good!
[21:27:40] <OnlineCop> Sadly, unless ansible uses the `regex` python module, you might have to "match" unwanted stuff and "capture" stuff you are interested in.
[21:27:41] <JohnDoe2> oh that's the good info
[21:28:03] <JohnDoe2> if it's a comment then all you have is whitespace before # ?
[21:28:09] <JohnDoe2> what does a block comment look like?
[21:28:25] <OnlineCop> Python block comments? I believe """...""" and '''...'''
[21:28:40] <OnlineCop> 3x quotes (either single- or double-quotes).
[21:28:46] <JohnDoe2> yeah it all depends on what the yaml is regexing :D
[21:29:08] <OnlineCop> One gripe with this is if you have quoted text that contains a '#' inside it.
[21:29:34] <berber> OnlineCop:  i am using the module lineinfile, so what it does is it changes lines that contain a match
[21:29:40] <berber> so the match itself isn't important
[21:29:47] <OnlineCop> I often hit a snag in C/C++ when I want to exclude '//.*' comments but then have "http://example.com" inside a string. :P
[21:30:01] <JohnDoe2> haha fun
[21:30:01] <berber> OnlineCop:  or what was the point you were trying to make?
[21:30:26] <OnlineCop> The point I was trying to make from which sentence above?
[21:30:31] <berber> the documentation says:  "Uses Python regular expressions. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html"
[21:31:05] <berber> OnlineCop:  the point you were trying to make with the regex python module, about matching and capturing

[21:31:38] <re101-lion-57> :20:sdsad-ewwr32432:#@4324-343
[21:31:42] <OnlineCop> Oh; many times, people simply match what they want. If they capture what they want instead, you change from looking at the match() result, to looking at the group() result.
[21:32:06] <OnlineCop> re101-lion-57: Is the ':' character the delimiter between these fields?
[21:32:34] <re101-lion-57> ':20'  and :21:
[21:32:41] <OnlineCop> re101-lion-57: `([^:]*):([^:]*):([^:]*)`
[21:33:41] <OnlineCop> Change '*' to '+' if you require the field to have at least 1 character before/after the ':'.
[21:34:43] <re101-lion-57> :20:dsfsf-34e24L:21:
[21:35:02] <re101-lion-57> this can come across  lines
[21:35:31] <OnlineCop> If you want to exclude newlines, change `[^:]` to `[^:\n]`
[21:35:54] <OnlineCop> It would help if you have some sample text on regex101 and indicated what you wanted to match.
