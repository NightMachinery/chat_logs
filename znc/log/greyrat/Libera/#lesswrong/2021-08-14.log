[12:35:06] <nshepperd2> they're cute when they're little, but just you wait till that Firefox phone grows up
[12:35:12] <quanticle> When we met up, I had him take a picture of me with his Firefox phone, and then I asked him to send it to me, as a memento
[12:35:15] <quanticle> He literally could not
[12:35:18] <quanticle> It was hilarious
[12:35:23] <quanticle> Everything he tried failed

[12:36:39] <quanticle> He tried to use Firefox Sync somehow to send the photo to his desktop, with the idea that he'd send the photo to his desktop, ssh into his desktop from his laptop, and then e-mail me the photo from his desktop, but that didn't work either
[12:37:27] <quanticle> It was incredible; he eventually pulled out his real phone and took a picture
[12:38:32] <nshepperd2> i hope you mean he displayed the photo on the firefox phone, then took a picture of it and sent *that* to you
[12:39:14] <quanticle> Unfortunately not, but I will say, that thought did strike me as I was walking away from our little meetup
[12:40:37] <quanticle> Yeah, it was at that moment that I new that Firefox OS would be a complete failure
[12:41:19] <quanticle> Because one thing that Mozilla didn't seem to realize was that when they were pitching FirefoxOS as a low-end phone OS for the third world, their *real* competition was not feature phones, but used smartphones from the West
[12:41:31] <quanticle> TBH it's an easy mistake to make
[12:41:41] <quanticle> Tata Motors made the same mistake with the Nano.
[12:42:11] <quanticle> They kept going on about how it was better than a scooter for families, but like, no, your competition is not a scooter, your competition is a used Maruti.

[13:40:08] <RiversHaveWings> the OAI code is overly complex
[13:40:20] <RiversHaveWings> btw I got a fine-tune run working on 8x A100
[13:40:33] <RiversHaveWings> This took some doing
[13:41:21] <nshepperd2> awesome!
[13:41:30] <RiversHaveWings> Because of MPI bugs
[13:41:40] <nshepperd2> I'm scared of MPI
[13:41:43] <RiversHaveWings> eheh
[13:42:04] <RiversHaveWings> It was hanging before starting training
[13:42:14] <RiversHaveWings> One process at 100% CPU and the rest at none
[13:42:19] <RiversHaveWings> I had to strace the processes
[13:42:50] <RiversHaveWings> It got to the point where, since mpiexec intercepted ctrl-c, I set up a signal handler to drop the Python processes to pdb when sent SIGUSR1
[13:43:03] <nshepperd2> wow
[13:43:22] <RiversHaveWings> And it turned out it was stuck somewhere that a Python signal handler couldn't be triggered
[13:43:42] <RiversHaveWings> So I started putting print statements before and after distributed communication primitives
[13:44:01] <RiversHaveWings> When I got seven of the before statement and none of the after
[13:44:08] <RiversHaveWings> (And there were eight processes)
[13:44:18] <RiversHaveWings> This narrowed it down to sections of code inside an "if dist.get_rank() == 0:"
[13:44:28] <RiversHaveWings> Specifically the one just before the dist.broadcast()
[13:44:57] <RiversHaveWings> It turned out the part that copied the PyTorch checkpoint binary from the rank 0 process to the others was hanging
[13:45:13] <RiversHaveWings> So I just made them all load the checkpoint with torch.load() instead.
[13:45:16] <RiversHaveWings> It ran after that.
[13:45:48] <nshepperd2> well, that's amazing
[13:46:24] <nshepperd2> I admire your persistence :)

[22:58:16] <pompolic> that one yes
[22:58:29] <kuudes> basicly something like <country case>+U <country case>+S = us flag

[23:03:08] <kuudes> yeah, when I copypasted the us flag to text editor, indeed it displayed the us flag there as well, and when I saved that and opened with hexedit, I got: F0 9F 87 BA  F0 9F 87 B8 
[23:04:17] <kuudes> "The accepted solution was to add 26 characters for letters used for the representation of regional indicators, which used in pairs would represent the ten national flags and possible future extensions."
