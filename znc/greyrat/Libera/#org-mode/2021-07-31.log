[00:57:27] <lisp123_> Hello, is it possible to have a newline on a list item, but have the block treated like a paragraph?
[00:57:32] <lisp123_> Currently it is breaking
[00:57:37] <lisp123_> and ending the list
[00:57:53] <lisp123_> I don't like too many words on a line, so I always newline after 70 characters
[00:58:38] <ngz> A single newline does not end a list. Nor do two consecutive ones.
[00:58:49] <ngz> Maybe the indentation is ending the list.
[00:59:42] <lisp123_> ngz: oh okay, that's what I would have thought. No indentation either, let me investigate further
[00:59:56] <lisp123_> this is when I export to HTML btw
[01:03:22] <lisp123_> It's definitely breaking
[01:03:27] <lisp123_> I think it might be a bug in the export
[01:04:51] <ngz> You may want to paste an example.
[01:06:23] <lisp123_> https://pastebin.com/EvCGBegF
[01:06:38] <lisp123_> then you can check the output on https://www.math.dev
[01:07:55] <ngz> As I wrote, it looks like indentation is wrong in your document.
[01:08:33] <lisp123_> Oh, I didn't think I had indent?
[01:08:37] <lisp123_> which part
[01:08:55] <lisp123_> (to me it is flush against the start of each line)
[01:09:29] <ngz> In every list, the second line and subsequent ones, are supposed to start at the right of the item bullet.
[01:09:49] <ngz> You may want to have a look at the manual about plain lists.
[01:10:10] <lisp123_> oh i see - does it matter how much it goes to the right?
[01:10:19] <lisp123_> or is it only 1 char after the .
[01:11:07] <ngz> No, it doesn't. But Emacs will align it 1 char (or 2 according to `org-list-two-spaces-after-bullet-regexp') nonetheless.
[01:11:41] <lisp123_> thank you :)

[03:39:32] <zebrag> About my index thing from above. I thought it was okay, but I didn't tested it well enough. And there is a serious problem.
[03:39:59] <zebrag> When I click on a link in the "index" it goes to some place like `#ID-9ca0bb24-407e-4d23-863b-b3ff8afb90db`
[03:40:19] <zebrag> which is fine, since I'm using `ID`
[03:40:48] <zebrag> But there have been no such anchors generated in the `misc.html` file
[03:41:24] <zebrag> instead some `<h2 id="org0e4f339">` sort of things
[03:41:44] <zebrag> So the two files do not agree one another
[03:41:56] <zebrag> And that's a heck of a problem.
[03:42:50] <zebrag> Is there an option that I should set to use `ID` in links?

[05:28:31] <zebrag> I should benefit from `(extra-ids (cdr ids))` but I don't
[05:29:17] <zebrag> CUSTOM_ID being empty
[05:29:29] <selfsymmetric-mu> Codaraxis: Honestly I don't even remember. I just know that I don't have edga in my workflow anymore. I use org-map-entries for a few things that you might describe as "triggers".
[05:30:18] <Codaraxis> At the moment, I have some activities I want to track. My goal is to set up a sequence I can cycle through based off priorities and have those priorities be variable based on a baseline set for the activity and the time since the activity was last done. One of the activities, "end day", would reset the reset the sequence.
[05:30:54] <Codaraxis> I'll give Org-edna a whirl and if the performance hit is too much to bear, I'll see if I can do anything with org-map-entries and some custom written logic

[05:46:26] <zebrag> According to this line, if `:PROPERTIES: :CUSTOM_ID: xxx :END:` is used instead of `:ID:`, then it should work. And I try and it does. But why dismissing `:ID:`? Why? (https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/master/lisp/ox-html.el#L3435)

[06:01:02] <zebrag> For the record, with using CUSTOM_ID instead of plain id, clicking on the keyword in the `theindex.html` generated index, does link to the relevant section in `misc.html`.
[06:02:09] <zebrag> So beside being unhappy being forced to use CUSTOM_ID, and not understanding why it is not deem worthy using ID,
[06:02:20] <zebrag> beside that, it works.
[06:03:55] <zebrag> Is there a function to query the local properties drawer and add a key/value pair? But it should also have to iterate on all the drawers.
