[00:04:03] <dpkg> Packages that end in '*-dbgsym' contain the symbols required for debugging executables and libraries.

[00:04:07] <somiaj> I don't see any package called epoll.

[01:59:19] <jhutchins> Lope: as I said.
[01:59:49] <PMT> and if your custom script is breaking on running outside the initramfs, maybe that's a problem with your script?

[05:18:21] <alex11> is it generally a good idea to do an occasional aptitude purge ~c?
[05:19:24] <Blondie101010> purging *should not*  have side effects, so it only serves at freeing disk space
[05:21:26] <Blondie101010> sorry that is wrong
[05:22:21] <Blondie101010> https://itsfoss.com/apt-command-guide/ says "apt remove just removes the binaries of a package. It leaves residue configuration files. apt purge removes everything related to a package including the configuration files."

[05:23:46] <Blondie101010> it deletes the package's configuration files

[07:35:16] <somiaj> depends on what you need, though I would look at what is avialable and maybe do some web searches for reviews and decide based on that
[07:38:06] <PMT> You might also find it useful, if you want to run an open source distro or whatever they call the projects for running Linux on wifi routers, to choose one of those, and then see if it has a "this works well" list to pick from.
[07:39:10] <somiaj> yea, for isntance I ahve read fairly bad reviews about linksys wrt routers with slow security support and so on, but if you want to run openwrt on them, it is a different story completely.
[07:40:14] <somiaj> My last wireless router I just used some 'best routers of 2020' list, found the price/prefomrance that fit my needs (did a little bit of extra reading on usability and so forth). I ended up going with an asus
[07:40:23] <PMT> (And even if it's on the "this works well" list, to double-check for a million bug reports on the forums or equivalent.)
[07:40:27] <somiaj> though I had no desire to run an open firmware on it
[07:42:01] <PMT> Really? I don't generally trust wifi router vendors to ship updates in a timely fashion, and sometimes I find I want to do things that aren't what the original vendor intended, like shoving weird DHCP parameters into the config file for some sparc netboot.

[07:43:08] <somiaj> I don't have any fancy ussage like that, wireless router is for my wifes devices, I use wired.
[07:43:23] *** Joins: ax5623 (~NickServ@user/ax562)
[07:43:40] <PMT> I use wired for many devices, but I do own a laptop, and do not have ethernet running to, say, my bedroom.
[07:44:00] <somiaj> I just don't want another thing I have to mess with, look up docs, and so forth. I wanted something that just worked after I plugged it in. Though I do agree, I don't trust them, but for the most part they are decent
[07:44:13] <somiaj> I found one that didn't get tons of negative reviews about timely updates
[07:45:26] <somiaj> But what this shows is there is no just use this router, you have to find one that suits your needs and risk model

[16:35:46] <silverstone> Hi. What is, in your opinion, the best way to manage several LUKS encrypted partitions (some root, some non-root data storage that can be mounted after boot) from e.g. a lightweight "management" system (e.g. Raspberry PI) that I could unlock only once ? There is Mandos (is it being updated ?) or I see some other people preferring some scripts and send the password/keyfile over TLS to the client computer. I guess I would need a "mountall" script (or 
[16:35:46] <silverstone> some common script amongst all devices) and invoke that command, e.g. over SSH, by piping the password or keyfile. Do you have any reccomendation on how this  could be done ? Or is my base concept flawed ?
[16:35:51] <galex-713> anyway I just found it, a friend told me about it, thank you!
[16:36:22] <silverstone> It would especially be interesting for some backup server that I only need to power on for e.g. 2h a day, then let them shut down to save power

As I said that was my main idea, I'd like to know what would be better and/or other people are doing. Putting an alarm clock and putting in 20 passwords to unlock manually all drives on all systems is NOT an option ...

[17:48:52] <m1dnight> Hi all. Quick question: I hve installed debian onto a third disk in my machine. 2 nvme drives, and one ssd. One nvme with windows, one with ubuntu, and one sata ssd with debian. The problem is that before I used to bot into grub and pick between win/ubuntu, but now I can only pick between debian/windows
[17:49:00] <m1dnight> update-grub2 doesnt find the instal, so it seems.
[17:49:27] <somiaj> m1dnight: I assume you have os-prober installed?
[17:49:57] <m1dnight> I might. I don't know what it is.
[17:50:20] <somiaj> m1dnight: it is the package that looks for other oses to add them to grub
[17:50:26] <somiaj> m1dnight: dpkg -l os-prober?
[17:50:40] <m1dnight> Ah yes, I have that package. 
[17:50:51] <m1dnight> I assume the update-grub works, because it finds the windows install. 
[17:51:05] <somiaj> It looks like you might have to have the root (and maybe /boot) partition mounted for ubuntu for os-prober to find the other linux os
[17:51:14] <m1dnight> However, i don't see an efi partition in fdisk, so perhaps the ubuntu install is non-efi. But that would be weird, since it worked in grub before with windows.
[17:51:29] <m1dnight> oh, I can do that. Let me check.
[17:51:41] <somiaj> efi or legacy shouldn't matter here
[17:53:55] <m1dnight> odd, still doesn't detect them. I mounted them under /tmp/ doesn't seem to do it.
[17:54:16] <m1dnight> I also tried linux-boot-prober and pointed it at all the partitions on the nvme but it says "not a block device", except for the swap. There it reported nothing.
[17:54:33] <somiaj> I also see something about adding GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false to /etc/default/grub
[17:54:41] <somiaj> https://wiki.debian.org/Grub#Dual_Boot
[17:58:06] <somiaj> The other option is to look at /etc/grub.d/ and maybe take 40_custom copy it to XX_ubuntu (XX should be a number depending on where you want the entry to appear) and write a manual entery to be added to grub and don't relay on auto detection tools like os-prober
[17:58:41] <somiaj> such as 15_ubuntu, and then manually add the grub entery, might have to look up some details on the exact syntax to have it boot the ubuntu kernels

[18:09:14] <m1dnight> Hrm, I never understood this all too well. I see in my ubuntu install three partitions: swap, /, and /home. In the debian install I see /boot/efi, /, and swap.
[18:09:19] <m1dnight> That doesnt look right I think?
[18:09:33] <amacater> I've previously done dual boot on one disk by installing Debian on one half, then installing Windows, then adding a second disk but telling them all to the same /boot/EFI
[18:09:41] <m1dnight> And windows has the EFS, something reserved, data, and another data. 
[18:10:09] <m1dnight> Yeah, iirc you can pick where to put the bootloader when you install ubuntu. I don't think I had that choice using debian graphical installer.

[18:13:52] <snoot> hey, in debian 10 i could set my font in zathura to Terminus by doing set font "Terminus 12", in debian 11 this doesn't work anymore, anyone know why?
[18:13:53] <amacater> If you use the standard Debian install medium, it gives you the option of text/graphical/expert etc. If you can bear to reinstall any/all of Windows/Ubuntu/Debian and have time, I'd suggest it. Windows does like to own a whole disk

[23:49:31] <jochum> People in #linux report that Debian 10 with GDM comes with the DM where TTY1 would be and actual Xorg on TT2, does anyone know why?
[23:50:41] <greycat> GNOME on Debian 10 actually uses Wayland by default.  You have to select "GNOME on X11" or something in the display manager to get X.

[23:51:38] <jochum> greycat: CTRL+ALT+F1 = DisplayManager (GDM), CTRL+ALT+F2 = Xorg

[23:53:36] <jochum> greycat: do you think gdm is the right path to look for?
[23:53:45] <Khepra> it's xorg in both TTYs, no? DM is also rendered by xorg
[23:54:21] <greycat> is it an actual *problem*?
[23:55:07] <greycat> I don't even use a display manager myself; I'm a startx guy.  And on Debian 10 (and 11, and I think also 9), startx on tty1 runs X on tty1.  The underlying shell session is hidden until X terminates.
[23:55:51] <greycat> (This is a change from Debian... 8 I think, in which X ran on the first unclaimed tty, usually 7).
[23:56:26] <n4dir> i did search the all-knowing web, and while i find nothing "official" Jessie is mentioned
[23:56:29] <hassoon> greycat: i remember X coming in tty7 in wheezy
[23:56:37] <hassoon> '13 era
[23:57:00] <greycat> Yeah, wheezy for sure.  I'm pretty sure deb9 (stretch) is where that changed, due to the kernel mode setting and all that.
[23:57:01] <n4dir> and before that too
[23:57:09] <jochum> I came from the Gentoo world, for me it always was on TTY7
[23:57:25] <hassoon> greycat: wheezy is debian 7
[23:57:31] <greycat> I am aware of that.
[23:59:16] <greycat> Oh, I can add one more data point: I have some deb9 workstations at work that run sddm/KDE and those have the display manager on tty7, and the X server after login also on tty7.
[23:59:22] <jochum> What about installing lightdm instead of GDM to see? It wouldn't change anything, right?
[23:59:47] <greycat> It would definitely change something.  At the very least, it would mean X would start running as root instead of the user.
[23:59:47] <jochum> Or the other way around I gonna install gdm and see?
[23:59:57] <greycat> gdm3 is the only DM where X launches as the user instead of root.
