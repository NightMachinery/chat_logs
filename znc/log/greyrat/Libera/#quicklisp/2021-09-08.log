[08:09:33] <ymir> Hi, I'm pretty new to Common Lisp and I'm trying to install cl-who. I have SBCL and Quicklisp set up. The cl-who documentation tells me to run `(ql:quickload :cl-who)`, but when I do so it tells me to load the cl-who ASDF system. I ran `(asdf:load-system :cl-who)`, but I'm not sure what to do next.
[08:09:59] <ymir> Any help would be appreciated
