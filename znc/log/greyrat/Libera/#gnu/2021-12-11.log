[04:07:19] <MysteriousSilver> i used to have a plug which tricks the phone into believing an external mic is connected, thus disabling the in-built one

[04:12:21] <jkk> in brief - phone in a silicone case in airplane mode + new mac on each connection to a wifi is enough?

[04:32:56] <tpefreedom> Freer than graphene
[04:32:58] <jkk> how come
[04:33:06] <tpefreedom> But replicant doesn't support 4g iirc

[04:34:04] <jkk> if all code is open it is free Xd
[04:34:14] <tpefreedom> so if 3g service isn't available (or at least not easily available to normal people) then graphenOS and calyxOS (and also stuff like lineageos) are the next best options.
[04:34:15] <bandali> not really

[05:12:51] <anton> I don't understand what you're saying
[05:13:09] <jkk> we are already free
[05:13:19] <jkk> can you write code now? can you post it?

[05:18:05] <jkk> code is free as it is - adding some license does not make it free
[05:18:14] <jkk> license is just a text file
