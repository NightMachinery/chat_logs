[02:43:44] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[02:53:54] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[02:57:25] <bfsfhkacjzgcytf> hello
[03:05:02] <jan6> olleh
[03:05:20] <jan6> I see bfsfhkacjzgcytf is taking opsec well enough to have a ibberish nonsense nick, lol
[03:05:24] <jan6> *gibberish
[03:05:27] <bfsfhkacjzgcytf> ;)
[03:06:06] <bfsfhkacjzgcytf> randomly generated my friend

[03:06:36] <bfsfhkacjzgcytf> sometimes they come out nicer than other times. I guess for Libera it came out a little awkward 
[03:07:41] <Joanna> About the links on how to have an anonymous phone number it’s only a matter of time before they close that loophole after they get people 100% dependent on cell phones.. It was once possible for people to get as many social security numbers as they liked by mail and now the social security number is used for national ID for Americans. It doesn’t really matter so much if a phone is registered anonymously because it still spy’s on 
[03:07:41] <Joanna> you regardless. The right thing to do is boycott apps that demand a phone number.
[03:08:35] <jan6> bfsfhkacjzgcytf: maybe look into "pronouncable password generator" thingies? ;P
[03:10:36] <jan6> e.g. might end up with "Bauloerozose1]" or "Haneprestere9" or "Utleyschionette2"
[03:11:03] <Joanna> I never knew there was such a thing
[03:15:57] <Joanna> jan6: I think the best way to deal with unscrupulous entities is to not go along with them at all. When they first started demanding ID to fly on planes in the USA it using an unidendified unabomber as a pretext ,was super easy and they would take just about any ID with a photo and name.
[03:18:34] <Joanna> You can’t always assume that things are going to stay as they are now. They are guaranteed to get more difficult.
