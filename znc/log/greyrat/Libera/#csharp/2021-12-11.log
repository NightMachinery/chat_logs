[03:45:42] <Nasp> Vice city was after gta 3 right
[03:45:51] <bomb> yeah
[03:45:51] <Nasp> Havent really played Gta since GTA 2

[03:46:18] <Nasp> I know
[03:46:28] <Nasp> I played GTA 3
[03:46:36] <Nasp> And then one in 2008 ish i think

[03:46:58] <Nasp> And then i bought one of the mroe recent one which was bugged so i couldn't progress

[03:54:00] <brianonymous> very true. cant infect corpses as easily
[03:54:00] <bomb> I have too many Russian neighbors, I don't think Putin would nuke here
[03:54:04] <Nasp> I had a crush from Ukraine
[03:54:31] <Nasp> Does it even matter what he Nukes wouldn't everyone retaliate?
[03:54:41] <Nasp> Unless you nuke some small unimportant country
[03:54:51] <brianonymous> its gonna come down to who has the best and most anti missle tech

[03:55:36] <Nasp> I think Russia even lost a few
[03:55:43] <brianonymous> sure, but i dont think at the level of taking down a whole country tho
[03:55:49] <bomb> what about backpack nukes?
[03:56:11] <brianonymous> and if we get to that mode, we have detection mechanisms that are pretty hardcore
[03:56:16] <brianonymous> DC is already preequipped
[03:56:24] <Nasp> Nah that wont help
[03:56:35] <Nasp> You can't detect it early enough to help

[03:59:56] <Nasp> Also what good would a few missiles in a container do?
[04:00:33] <brianonymous> it was supposed to be full launch system.. so like if we did go to war, they would just activate them

[04:04:02] <bomb> they're planning how to nuke USA, EU, and UK
[04:04:11] <bomb> they seem to be settled on suitcase nukes
[04:04:15] <JakeSays> bpmedley: to pre-process c#?
[04:04:28] <Nasp> As in #if?
[04:04:53] <Nasp> bomb The US also had those artillery nukes back in the 1950s
[04:05:02] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Yeah.  I'm considering a project with both open source and commercial options.  And, I want a single code base I can generate the open source version from.
[04:05:03] <Nasp> With a bigger explosion radius than the range of the gun
[04:05:10] * brianonymous hands nasp a comma, lol
[04:05:15] * brianonymous waves to the fbi
[04:05:22] <bpmedley> Nasp : Yes, I think I could get away with just #if.
[04:05:26] <JakeSays> Nasp: tactical nukes. they tended to kill the launcher dude
[04:05:38] <Nasp> bpmedley:  Also what do you need the pre processor for exactly
[04:05:52] <bpmedley> Nasp : Did my answer to JakeSays  make sense?
[04:06:00] <JakeSays> bpmedley: use roslyn to pre-process the c# source for the opensource export
[04:06:03] <Nasp> No it didnt
[04:06:09] <Nasp> You want a single code base
[04:06:15] <bomb> but Russia has tsar bomba
[04:06:23] <bomb> that's a lot of suitcases
[04:06:35] <Nasp> Not sure why single codebase and open source has to do with it
[04:06:39] <Nasp> bomb:  That's one big suitcase
[04:06:42] <bpmedley> Nasp : I want a code base that I can generate an open source version and commercial version from.
[04:06:42] <bomb> Царь бо́мба
[04:06:52] <bpmedley> Nasp : For example, the commercial version would have a gui.
[04:07:12] <JakeSays> Nasp: it's common for companies to maintain two source bases for a project that has an opensource component
[04:07:17] <Nasp> "Sir you need to put that  27 tons suitcase in the scanner so we can check it for potentia bombs"

[04:08:03] <bpmedley> Nasp : What would you suggest?
[04:08:14] <Nasp> Weren't russia the ones against gays during the olympics
[04:08:19] <Nasp> Yet they have an LGBT building
[04:08:23] <Nasp> bpmedley:  I have no idea really
[04:08:29] <Nasp> But do you need it now?
[04:08:34] <JakeSays> bpmedley: but seriously you should solve the problem with good design instead of source transformations
[04:08:39] <Nasp> Might be better to just start of and see how the product goes
[04:08:45] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Such as?
[04:08:50] <bomb> what was that Russian girlband arrested for supporting LGBT
[04:08:51] <Nasp> Compiler pre processers are never nice to work with
[04:08:53] <bomb> something like Pussy Juice
[04:09:01] <JakeSays> bpmedley: well, proper separation of open and closed functionality
[04:09:04] <Nasp> Might be better if you could make it as plugins to the existing product
[04:09:14] <bomb> ah, this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot
[04:09:16] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Perhaps you could give me an example?
[04:09:47] <bpmedley> Nasp : I considered plugins and may go that route.  However, the commercial version will have a Blazor UI.
[04:10:04] <Nasp> JakeSays: How would you like to pay 0.068 dollar a minute to drive your own car?
[04:10:05] <JakeSays> bpmedley: well, if the difference between the two is a gui, just separate the business logic from the gui logic (which should be done anyway)
[04:10:13] <Nasp> bpmedley:  Well then just dont ship that part
[04:10:13] <bomb> bpmedley instant bankruptcy
[04:10:17] <Nasp> Have it in a separate repo
[04:10:28] <Nasp> Blazor as in API part + SPA right?
[04:10:52] <bpmedley> JakeSays :  The hope is there will be more features, as well, in the commercial version.
[04:10:53] <JakeSays> Nasp: why would i pay to drive my own car?
[04:11:03] <bpmedley> Nasp : Yes, API + SPA + Server configuration.
[04:11:04] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Just a suggestion i saw they are testing here
[04:11:09] <Nasp> roadpricing for everyone
[04:11:15] <Nasp> Because aren't expensive enough to drive here
[04:11:35] <JakeSays> bpmedley: then make your design flexible enough to accomodate closed features
[04:11:57] <JakeSays> bpmedley: but it's hard to go in to more detail w/o knowing more about the project
[04:12:17] <Nasp> 7.4 dollars a gallon, 200% taxes on car
[04:12:26] <Nasp> And now there's a suggestion to make road pricing
[04:12:34] <JakeSays> Nasp: we already have that here in many places - toll roads
[04:12:44] <brianonymous> oh, road pricing = tolls?
[04:12:49] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yeah but here the idea is you put in a tracker and you pay for everywhere
[04:12:55] <Nasp> Even just standing still in your driveway
[04:12:57] <bpmedley> JakeSays : That's true.  Here is a specific example: https://github.com/brianmed/SingleFileBlazor/blob/main/Server/SingleFileBlazor.Server.csproj#L20  <-- How could I exclude that from the open source version?
[04:13:15] <Nasp> Also aren't your toll road private roads?
[04:13:18] <brianonymous> they once taxed us in maryland for rain
[04:13:40] <brianonymous> based on the square footage of your roof
[04:13:53] <bpmedley> Rather, JakeSays , how could I conditionally compile both with and without that pacakge?
[04:14:59] <JakeSays> bpmedley: you place an abstraction over that library
[04:15:17] <bpmedley> If you have time, can you be specific?
[04:15:45] <brianonymous> just with build conditionals
[04:15:49] <Nasp> well what should the UI part do in the open source version?
[04:15:59] <Nasp> Or should it just not exist at all
[04:16:14] <brianonymous> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives
[04:16:26] <JakeSays> brianonymous: bah. that's nasty
[04:16:38] <brianonymous> it can be used smartly
[04:16:56] <brianonymous> my personal experience has been that its bad to have the commercial bits in the noncommercial binaries
[04:17:03] <JakeSays> not for feature segregation
[04:17:12] <JakeSays> of course it's bad
[04:17:14] <bpmedley> brianonymous : PackageReference supports Condition?  I didn't think of that.
[04:17:37] <JakeSays> bpmedley: pretty much all elements support conditions
[04:17:51] <JakeSays> but he's not talking about the project files
[04:18:02] <brianonymous> sure i am.. just build conditionals in general really
[04:18:03] <bpmedley> However, my preference is for the the open source version to be available on github without any closed source code included..
[04:18:11] <brianonymous> if that means not including a package, thats rad
[04:18:21] <JakeSays> bpmedley: yeah that should be the goal
[04:18:46] <JakeSays> bpmedley: why would you not want to include that package you referenced?
[04:19:47] <bpmedley> JakeSays : https://github.com/brianmed/SingleFileBlazor/blob/main/Server/Program.cs#L33 <-- It's only needed for Blazor Embedding of wwwroot, I think.
[04:20:31] <brianonymous> it would allow you to have commercial bits all lonesome in its own repo
[04:21:07] <Nasp> If i were you i would also fall back to startup.cs
[04:21:21] <JakeSays> bpmedley: well, here's the big issue with partially open projects and conditional code: shit gets really nasty if you want to allow contributions to the open part.

[04:22:36] <bpmedley> brianonymous : The goal is a repo with the preprocessing directives and then generating the open source version that would have minimal, if any, directives.
[04:22:51] <JakeSays> bpmedley: so in that specific case, instead of having conditional code you would have an abstraction called IStaticFileProvider.
[04:22:53] <Nasp> https://imgur.com/gallery/A0sejgv i hate when people like to have it warmer inside
[04:22:59] <Nasp> "But i'm cold"
[04:23:00] <brianonymous> sure. you could just look for the presence of commercial parts
[04:23:06] <Nasp> Yes then take on more clothes, i can't take any more off
[04:23:12] <JakeSays> bpmedley: you really don't want any conditionals.
[04:23:26] <bpmedley> JakeSays : However, I don't want the open source version to even reference static files.

[04:23:59] <brianonymous> this was a lot easier when we had to loadlib() everything
[04:23:59] <JakeSays> bpmedley: then call it ICustomSetupProvider or something
[04:25:18] <Nasp> Not sure i get the problem
[04:27:36] <bpmedley> Nasp : Because, for example, there is some Blazor code that should not be viewable in the open source version.
[04:27:38] <brianonymous> i have an idea! screw the opensores side
[04:27:43] <brianonymous> make all the cash
[04:28:20] <bpmedley> JakeSays : The problem is that the abstraction would need to be in the open source version.
[04:28:43] <bpmedley> brianonymous : Maybe, I'm not sure how things will go.
[04:28:47] <JakeSays> bpmedley: yes
[04:28:53] <Nasp> bpmedley:  yes but what does the open source version do then
[04:28:58] <Nasp> Can't you just do it oppiste
[04:29:06] <Nasp> Make the closed version include the open source version
[04:29:08] <bpmedley> Nasp : Only works via command-line.
[04:29:21] <Nasp> Then wh even have the ui
[04:29:23] <Nasp> Remove it?
[04:29:41] <brianonymous> oh, in that case, if you are basically a command line.. the command line is the open source... the ui is a whole new app that calls in
[04:29:47] <JakeSays> bpmedley: but that's ok if the abstraction is in the os version.
[04:29:48] <bpmedley> I'm hopeful for several features in the commercial version that would not be in the open source version.
[04:29:49] <brianonymous> ala the ffmpeg style

[04:32:25] <JakeSays> for your source code?
[04:32:36] <brianonymous> bpmedley: lots of transcode systems use a similar model.. many use ffmpeg as the engine, and just stdin/out from a whole nother app
[04:32:42] <bpmedley> Yes, for the original repo that would generate both the commercial and the open source versions.
[04:33:00] <JakeSays> bpmedley: then just use razor. at least you'll have decent ide integration
[04:33:16] <JakeSays> but i can tell you now that you're going to end up with a massive cluster fuck
[04:33:54] <Nasp> What is this app supposed to do
[04:33:58] <JakeSays> and no one will be able to contribute
[04:34:08] <bpmedley> Nasp : It's an on premise Cdn.
[04:34:10] <Nasp> And i sitll dont get why you need a UI in the open source part if there is no ui
[04:34:16] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Probably.. :)
[04:34:24] <Nasp> So Kestrel as a service?
[04:34:40] <bpmedley> Nasp : Sorry for my lack of explanation.  There is no UI in the open source version.
[04:34:40] <JakeSays> Nasp: the other way around - no ui in the os version
[04:34:52] <Nasp> Yes

[04:35:22] <Nasp> Just dont have the UI project at all in that repo
[04:35:26] <bpmedley> Nasp : One reason is because Kestrel is configured differently when embedding Blazor files.
[04:35:48] <brianonymous> thats why it needs to live alone

[04:36:14] <JakeSays> bpmedley: you do realize that it'd be a trivial effort for someone to add static file support
[04:36:18] <bpmedley> brianonymous : However, the same Kestrel server that is serving Blazor files is also an Api server.
[04:36:29] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Would you explain?
[04:36:46] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Are you saying just clone the repo and .AddStaticFiles() or whatever it is?
[04:36:48] <brianonymous> would it make more sense to treat the openSores part as a lib
[04:36:57] <JakeSays> bpmedley: i can just go in to the setup file that you posted and add calls to do exactly what you're doing there
[04:37:04] <JakeSays> brianonymous: exactly
[04:37:05] <bpmedley> brianonymous : I'm not sure.
[04:37:37] <Nasp> Also on premise CDN isn't that just a webserver
[04:37:45] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Sure.  That's fine.  I'd be cool with anyone downloading the code and doing anything the Apache 2.0 License allows.
[04:37:50] <bpmedley> Nasp : Yes.
[04:37:52] <Nasp> CDN usually implies it's hosted in multiple regions
[04:38:09] <bpmedley> Nasp : I want to provide support for Origin and Edge servers.

[04:45:47] <JakeSays> bpmedley: dude i already told you: you have an abstraction ILoadsShit. class ClosedLoadsShit { /*does the static file thing*/} class OpenLoadsShit {/*does nothing*/}
[04:46:18] <bpmedley> And, would the abstraction be shown, in any way, in the open source version?

[04:48:01] <bpmedley> Let me ponder that.
[04:48:37] <JakeSays> bpmedley: the only time that should be a concern is if it's a) a security issue or b) exposes intellectual property
[04:48:55] <bpmedley> Makes sense.  I was thinking of asthetics.
[04:48:57] <JakeSays> but a generic ILoadShit.Initialize() method does neither
[04:49:02] <bomb> c) your bored
[04:49:28] <JakeSays> lol you think you can get decent asthetics with either conditional code generation or pre-processing?
[04:49:47] <bpmedley> JakeSays : No.  However, I was hoping the generated code would look good.
[04:49:55] <bomb> heh

[04:50:02] <Nasp> Isn't that your entire problem

[04:50:18] <bomb> checkout moc-generated Qt code
[04:50:59] <bpmedley> Nasp : Currently, I'm thinking the Origin server would host the Blazor files and be an Api server for the Edge nodes.  That may be silly, let me think..
[04:51:10] <JakeSays> bpmedley: but you haven't addressed the bigger issue: allowing contributions to the code that is generated will be a nightmare
[04:51:25] <Nasp> Also why would people contribute?
[04:51:39] <JakeSays> huh?
[04:51:45] <bpmedley> JakeSays : I hear you.  The hope is that the open source version would be mainly used for marketing.

[04:52:41] <bpmedley> However, I want a single binary for everything.
[04:52:42] <bomb> what is a fluffer?
[04:53:06] <Nasp> So the Server is the CDN and the UI
[04:53:10] <bpmedley> The simple case is just run "Blah" and have a fully functional app.
[04:53:15] <Nasp> What if you just keept that UI somewhere else
[04:53:16] <Nasp> Tada
[04:53:17] <JakeSays> bpmedley: the focus should be on an easily maintained code base, not binary count
[04:53:22] <bpmedley> Nasp : Yes.  The server is the Origin and the UI.
[04:53:28] <bpmedley> Nasp : That may work.
[04:53:49] <bomb> > A fluffer is a person employed to keep a porn performer's penis erect on the set.

[13:39:47] <SKull> MichaelLong: you can either a) wait for the package, that then won't arrive due to murphy's law, or b) do sports and groceries and miss it.
[13:40:21] <MichaelLong> SKull, absolute correct assessment
[13:40:24] <MatthiasVance> Yeah after waiting the entire day "oh it's delayed"
[13:40:48] <MatthiasVance> Our default postal service is actually pretty good, also with ETAs but the rest (DHL, UPS) suck
[13:41:18] <MichaelLong> this will come with amazon logistics usually on time
[13:41:23] <SKull> my partner ordered some vinyl records last week. one was in the mailbox, and for the other one, the same guy left a note that he has to pick it up at the post office. both packages were the same size with the same content.

[14:33:40] <SKull> MatthiasVance: the only risk factor are two houses for the less fortunate (alcoholics and other addicts), but they know not to defecate where they eat.
[14:35:18] <SKull> MatthiasVance: plus I wouldn't assume them to be thieves either just because they have some problems.
[14:36:12] <MatthiasVance> SKull: Same, but the other day there was a band of thieves in a van that kept tracking stuff in this neighbourhood
[14:36:15] <SKull> chances are i'm going to end up in one of those facilities myself somewhen in the future. and i certainly never stole anything, except a pack of gummy bears during a dare when i was a child

[17:35:18] <Slade> totally legit. https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09LHDP7KN?th=1
[17:37:57] <bpmedley> Slade : I'm thinking of getting something similar.  If Thunderbolt is an option, this looks neat: https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-envoy-pro-fx
[17:40:18] <moose> bpmedley: I use one of these https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HNY22ZM/A/lacie-1tb-rugged-ssd-pro-external-drive-with-thunderbolt-3 for storing my videos/photos from off-roading and camping
[17:40:29] <moose> Not sure what your use case is, but I assume the speed and ruggedness is important :p
[17:40:51] <moose> And these have Thunderbolt 3
[17:41:43] <bpmedley> moose : That does look nice.  I'm thinking of an external drive for VMs.  I probably want Thunderbolt for speed considering that I want to use VMs on the drive.
[17:42:03] <moose> VMs for testing or something?
[17:42:07] <bpmedley> Slade : Do you have an XBOX or is it for your PC?
[17:42:47] <bpmedley> moose : Yeah.  I only have 512GB on my iMac.  I'm constantly shuffling things around and I do some Windows development and testing.
[17:43:41] <moose> I imagine the stuff you're doing isn't massively throughput heavy?
[17:43:59] <bpmedley> Not currently
[17:45:28] <moose> USB 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 are going to do everything you desire or can really expect from an external drive. Thunderbolt of course will do it too. Main consideration I would be worried about is latency for small random reads, unless you're really deploying crazy heavy stuff and need large (> 1-2 GB) testing databases and all of that.
[17:45:57] <moose> Think about it, do you really need to move 2.5 GB/s or is 800 MB/s going to be fine? :)
[17:46:22] <bpmedley> I really have no idea.  I haven't benchmarked my current VM.
[17:46:51] <moose> If it's a newer old MacBook or a Mac Pro, you'll get around 1.2-1.8 GB/s reads/writes sustained probably

[17:47:12] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[17:47:19] <moose> That external drive is probably faster heh
[17:47:34] <bpmedley> I'm currently using VMware Fusion because Parallels borked my Devuan VM tools install, I think.
[17:47:35] <moose> But I bet the thing you're seeing when you see sluggish is high latency.
[17:47:49] <moose> One thing I did to really boost testing was add more RAM to my dev box.
[17:47:55] <bpmedley> Doesn't feel sluggish.  I just don't have much space.
[17:47:56] <moose> Now I roll around with a minimum of 64 GB of my dev machines.
[17:48:00] <moose> oh, space.
[17:48:02] <moose> My bad.
[17:48:17] <bpmedley> It's cool.
[17:48:31] <bpmedley> All those bin/ and obj/ folders add up.. :-0
[17:48:35] <moose> But yeah then any modern SSD is probably super fine
[17:48:56] <moose> I personally would opt for Thunderbolt because I like having the fastest stuff, even if it literally doesn't matter. It's nice knowing I can't get any faster. lol
[17:49:07] <bpmedley> haha
[17:55:04] <xsperry> thunderbolt is nice because with one cable you can connect your laptop to your monitor, mouse, keyboard, and charge it at the same time
[17:55:26] <xsperry> (and LAN)

[17:56:54] <bpmedley> Slade : Sorry, is the bus speed too low for the drive?  I'm not up to speed on some of these things..

[17:58:43] <moose> I quoted a nice build with 96 GB of RAM and a minimal video card to support triple head 4K. It's only $19,548 and could be yours for $1,629/mo for 12 months! lol
[17:59:14] <Slade> bpmedley, basically everything in the ad totally conflicts with other parts of the ad

[18:12:40] <moose> Yeah, there's a lot of opportunity doing remote work.
[18:13:10] <SKull> but to do it, you need to be able to sell yourself. lz_ i'm also bad at exactly that.
[18:13:17] <Miles8of9> ...but taxes take about 65-70% of that....

[18:16:26] <SKull> Miles8of9: ah, Italy, the posterchild of economy *scnr*
[18:16:54] <Miles8of9> and you also have to pay retirement contributions which take another good part
[18:18:01] <Miles8of9> AND in some cases you don't benefint from those payments! which means you won't get money when you retire

[18:21:04] <Slade> Miles8of9, italy has like 3.5 million civil servants doesnt it
[18:21:10] <moose> Many people in the US also gripe about "People born after 1970 will never get retirement payments, it'll go bankrupt!"
[18:21:33] <moose> However there is no actual evidence to support that and apparently this whole thing goes back to the inception of the social security program.
[18:22:40] <Slade> which is more than the US has. with maybe 15% the population
[18:22:42] <SKull> big part of our national retirement fund is based on cigarette taxes. and since everything is getting faster and more stressfull, i have hopes that i will get to retire ^^

[18:26:30] <moose> If you have really good programming skills but zero personality, are arrogant and rude, you can still make like $200k / year here pretty easily.
[18:26:41] <moose> Eventually that adds up to millions, right?
[18:27:19] <SKull> moose: i'm a skilled programmer, but my arrogance and honesty (rudeness) stood in my own way more than i'd like to admin
[18:27:24] <Slade> SKull, theres no secrets, money flows from everything here.  i mean this is the country that mastered selling bottled water, for more than the price of gasoline
[18:27:41] <Slade> thats an engineering problem to solve.
[18:27:46] <moose> Oh, definitely. It's a harder road for those of us who choose not to praise our leadership constantly.
[18:27:56] <SKull> Slade: it's also the country with way too much lead in its pipes, so selling water bottles isn't that far fetched
[18:28:23] <Slade> SKull, well, you can take the analogy how you want to :)
[18:28:54] <moose> But perhaps your skill was largely derived from where you put effort? Imagine if you had split between being more personable and overly friendly (yes, overly... I am sure you're friendly, as is) you may not have the chops to compete with the top tier folks.

[18:29:43] <SKull> moose: yeah i really don't fit in with the suits that make decisions.
[18:29:45] <Slade> friendly isnt really a concern, approachable is. selling in IT is being a specialist in the thing they're looking for
[18:29:52] <moose> I think it's easier to learn the interpersonal dynamics aspect of business than become a very skilled engineer. And if you make a name for yourself as an honest and skilled person with high integrity and sprinkle in some soft skills over time, maybe that is a better road long-term.
[18:30:35] <moose> And you may never. But you might be able to market yourself upward a bit better than you are currently.
[18:30:48] <Slade> when your toilet backwashes and shoots shitwater all over the place, you call a plumber, even tho a handyman can do the same thing for less
[18:31:00] <Slade> same concept in IT

[18:32:21] <Slade> attorney $200/hr   trial attorney $300   international tax lawyer $1000/hr
[18:34:14] <moose> But anyway, it depends on goals and stuff and how much effort you want to put into the things. Ultimately you can sacrifice a ton and make a lot of money, but if you have a family to take care of or other aspirations and such, then there's many decisions to be made.
[18:34:56] <moose> Crazy roles like "super elite engineer architect millionaire" require huge commitments and higher risk of failure to meet expectations in a sustained fashion

[20:25:20] <lara99> Hi, I am going crazy with system.drawing, I need to set the line spacing of a text (inside a rectangular area) but being the characters not all with the same length I cannot do it manually in an effective way... how could I do it?
[20:32:34] <bomb> you can't lara99
[20:33:49] <lara99> bomb: this sounds incredible to me, this is not a strange option, line and letter spacing are fundamentals...
[20:35:19] <lara99> how can I do?
[20:35:30] <bomb> you can't
[20:35:48] <lara99> ok but imust exist a way to obtain this
[20:36:04] <lara99> *it
[20:36:13] <bomb> you implement your own mechanism letter by letter
[20:36:30] <lara99> my god it is an incredibly big and complex work

[20:42:52] <MatthiasVance> Funny how the controller scaffolding doesn't match the default API conventions 🙄
[20:43:27] <MatthiasVance> lara99: You can get a measurement for the exact text you're going to place, does that help?
[20:44:17] <lara99> the text changes ech time
[20:45:17] <MatthiasVance> Yes, you can get a measurement each time?
[20:45:50] <lara99> yes
[20:46:13] <bomb> yes
[20:46:18] <MatthiasVance> What is this lol
[20:46:24] <bomb> YES, WE CAN!
[20:46:57] <MatthiasVance> YES CAN
[20:47:24] <lara99> ok ok I try
[20:48:26] <MatthiasVance> iirc there are 2 methods to measure text built-in and they both give different results, might want to do some research on that
[20:48:35] <MatthiasVance> Something with GDI+ vs .. something else

[21:55:58] <bpmedley> How are ya'll structuring your Minimal API projects that don't use Controllers or Razor Pages?
[21:57:03] <bomb> single file that's how
[21:57:21] <bomb> point of Minimal API is you can structure it however you want
[21:57:34] <bpmedley> bomb : And the various MapGet and MapPost just kind of hangout in the single file?
[21:58:14] <bomb> yes bpmedley it's following the Sinatra, Flask, Javalin pattern
[21:58:20] <bpmedley> Understood
[21:59:09] <bomb> it's not a requirement, for sure, but if you're gonna spread to project into multiple controllers, models, etc. you wouldn't really want the Minimal API would you?
[21:59:35] <bpmedley> bomb : I'm not sure because I don't have all the various options memorized.
[21:59:50] <bomb> or maybe you want to implement your own monolithic framework, that's also when Minimal API can be useful
