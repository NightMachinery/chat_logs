[03:32:20] <_inky> >By the way Putin is authorized to do stuff by the duma?
[03:32:20] <_inky> are you really so naive? omg. the parliament obeys him. everyone obeys him. he created a system when one man decides and noone has a courage to say 'no'. have you seen that cringe video where he humiliates the chief of intelligence? omg, i just have no strength to talk so much.
[03:38:45] <CalimeroTeknik> poor chief of intelligence struggles with the novel concept of being asked to voice an opinion ^^
[03:39:02] <CalimeroTeknik> supports the wrong agenda point
[03:39:58] <CalimeroTeknik> quite clearly he doesn't understand why he even has to support some agenda, of course he supports, it's not his job to decide that
[03:40:32] <CalimeroTeknik> I don't deny that it's humiliating being befuddled on TV
[03:41:31] <CalimeroTeknik> but the problem that leads to that is his confusion being asked a question that he didn't consider to be his job to answer

[03:50:19] <Joanna> _inky: well that’s possible. Do you know what’s happening in Ukraine lately? Do your friends see russian troops?
[03:53:08] <Joanna> I don’t doubt that people could be intimidated by Putin but doesn’t that go for every country where people just go along with things they know are wrong because nobody wants to stick their necks out?
[03:55:08] <Joanna> When it comes down to it most people are very selfish yet at the same time are easy to trick. Selfless acts are based upon emotions pretty much
[03:58:49] <Joanna> And it’s really easy to stir up emotions and make people want to run off and get themselves killed with propaganda such as stories about babies on bayonets or babies in incubators being thrown onto a hard floor. Ironically the people who were outraged about mistreatment of babies have no problem with thousands of babies being killed when cities are bombed.
[03:59:56] *** plankster_ is now known as plank
[04:02:42] <Joanna> It’s very illogical isn’t it unless of course you think babies deserve to be punished for what some leader of a country did.

[04:37:11] <CalimeroTeknik> (Russia's side)
[04:48:12] <Joanna> Putin would be stupid to let nato put up missiles in Ukraine. It’s as simple as that.
[04:49:31] <Joanna> All the talk on both sides is unconfirmed. If the Ukraine government cared about people being killed they would have surrendered already. They can’t win this war.
