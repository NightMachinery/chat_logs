[15:03:05] <dag> looks like the inferred type is lost in the foreach but it is actually passing it through array_filter or array_slice that does it

[16:35:51] <chazy> hi, my team is currently developing an online game, just the client side, and we're wondering if php would make sense for the backend, what do you think?
[16:36:18] <stenno> thatst a really vague question lol
[16:36:46] <chazy> it's a single player game for now
[16:36:50] <stenno> php is certainly a language you can use for the backend of a web application
[16:37:15] <stenno> the only caveat that comes to mind is that php is not really good with websockets
[16:38:58] <novns> stenno, you can use swoole
[16:39:03] <novns> https://www.swoole.co.uk/docs/modules/swoole-websocket-server
[16:39:45] <novns> it's an extension for PHP made by bloody Englishmen
[16:41:20] *** Joins: ms49434 (~ms49434@user/ms49434)
[16:43:21] <novns> though there's no need in PHP for backend things
[16:43:57] <stenno> what do you mean with that
[16:44:54] <novns> you should choose a tool for the task
[16:45:15] <novns> and PHP is not a proper tool for implementing gaming backends
[16:45:48] <stenno> why not, apart from the lack of nonblocking IO which apparently is mitigated by swoole?
[16:45:54] <novns> even with some British extensions
[16:46:40] <stenno> (disclaimer: i would not choose php as a backend language for almost anything)
[16:48:33] <novns> PHP is designed to run from scratch on every request, so they don't free any memory
[16:49:10] <stenno> oh you mean php as a 'long-running process'?
[16:49:29] <stenno> i heard that in the past, i thought they addressed that issue it by now
[16:49:37] <novns> it is assumed that the allocated memory will be freed when the process terminates
[16:49:45] <stenno> right, i see
[16:50:14] *** Quits: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher) (Quit: bye)
[16:50:31] <TinoDidriksen> PHP after 7.0 is vastly better for such tasks, and even more so after 8.0.
[16:50:53] <novns> so PHP is nice for your homepage counters and guestbooks
[16:51:11] <novns> but for gaming backends it's not suitable
[16:52:05] <TinoDidriksen> Eh, I wouldn't mind it for such things these days.
[16:52:12] <dag> php has interfaces for forking processes and network sockets etc so it's doable. some risk for memory leakage for long-running processes though but it's probably fine by now. but it's rarely done in php
[16:54:28] <novns> dag, forks are too heavy sometimes, you need threads
[16:55:44] <dag> heavy? what you mean
[16:56:44] <novns> dag, maximum 4194303 processed in x86_64 for example
[16:56:51] <novns> (linux)
[16:57:01] <novns> *processes
[16:57:36] <novns> if your client base is larger you have to invent solutions
[16:58:55] <novns> and you typically need recvmmsg for faster things, but you have socket_recvmsg only in PHP
[17:03:53] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)

[18:09:41] <stenno> the js equivalent https://sugarjs.com/docs/#/DateParsing

[21:30:09] <luva> I have several variables I set via $_GET within the URL. Is it possible to have checkboxes or something else that when active, add a variable to the URL like mydomain.com?variable1="5"
[21:30:22] <luva> inside the page, checkboxes
[21:31:44] <da_wunder> why not to use ?foo[]=foo&foo[]=bar ?
[21:31:51] <Naktibalda> luva: that checkbox must be in a form and the form must be submitted
[21:32:40] <Naktibalda> or you can modify URL using javascript client side code
[21:33:33] <luva> The thing I want to achieve is, since I have one php page that displays different things depending on which variable is set and how it is set. So sometimes the page is mydomain.com?variable1=5 sometimes its mydomain.com?variable1=3&variable2=10 and depending on the checkboxes, I want them to add the variable to the URL or not
