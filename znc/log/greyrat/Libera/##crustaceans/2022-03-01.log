[00:00:08] <pja> I’ve checked & I did update the drive firmware. phew :)
[00:00:29] <pja> Good luck with the data recovery.
[00:01:19] <kronk> thaaaanks. I've gone through and checked that what I did get was... I guess sufficient enough.
[00:01:38] <kronk> I've contacted two companies and one wants to look at the drive but didn't give me a quote yet.
[00:04:31] <pja> The irony is, the 320 has capacitors on board so it can write data safely in the event of power loss.
[00:04:40] <pja> (unusual for a consumer SSD at the time)
[00:04:52] <pja> Intel must have screwed up the code somehow...
[00:05:44] <pja> Hmm. 4Tb written out of a max lifetime of ~16Tb written.
[00:06:39] <pja> Maybe I should think about replacing it? On the other hand, it’s still going & I have daily backups...
[00:08:01] <kronk> see my mistake wasn't doing daily backups.
[00:08:13] <kronk> I backed up _CRITICAL_ stuff to that 1tb drive and slowly leeched it to my NAS.
[00:08:45] <kronk> err, my mistake was _not doing daily backups_. english is ambiguous.
[00:15:56] * pja has now disappeared down the rabbit hole of finding out which modern SSDs actually have power loss data protection circuits.
[00:17:33] <gwozniak> Sounds like a fun rabbit hole
[00:17:45] <gwozniak> kronk: good luck, btw
[00:17:55] <kronk> thanks.
[00:18:59] <kronk> I think I lost a bit of data. mostly older code (I think), a few images, and some credential data.
[00:21:31] <pja> (expensive data centre ones appears to be the answer...)
[00:23:29] <kronk> yikes, I think I lost my bank password, that's fun.
[00:23:41] <indigo> Better to lose it than for someone else to find it
[00:24:08] <kronk> yeeeeeeah.
[00:24:17] <kronk> I think I lost a whole host of stuff.
[00:24:29] <kronk> well, like that anyway.
[00:26:01] <gwozniak> That's a bit of a hassle
[00:27:35] <pja> Probably worth updating the firmware on the drive & then issuing a drive reset to wipe it if it had any data on it you wouldn’t want anyone to know.
[00:27:42] <pja> Or just feed it to a shredder...
[00:27:50] <pja> but the latter is a tad un green :)
[00:29:34] <kronk> if I can't find something I _really can't be without_, I'll go with the data recovery.
[00:29:40] <kronk> this dump is surprisingly complete-ish.
[00:32:19] <kronk> a lot of crap was marked as gzipped data, which is a lie.

[05:57:57] <kronk> so, small update.
[05:58:20] <kronk> the partition table seems to be in-tact-ish. corrupted, but the sector offsets are fine.
[05:59:52] <kronk> it looks like I have I have a _chunk_ of the data partition.
[06:01:22] <kronk> which is good... might be able to recover a portion of the file table.
[06:04:15] <kronk> won't do much to save the data that's not there, but I'll at least give some context to the data that is there. hopefully.
[06:04:28] <kronk> I don't know if blind data grafting will work, but I'm praying it will.

[19:53:23] <kronk> ho-lee fu-cking shiiiiiit
[19:53:27] <kronk> I was right.
[19:53:30] <kronk> the inode table was in-tact.
[19:53:36] <kronk> I CAN GET MY SHIT OFF OF THIS.
[19:53:41] <kronk> AHHAAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHH
[19:57:14] <river> :D
[19:57:16] <river> yay!!!!!!!
[19:59:10] <kronk> it's not MUCH data, but if I do some surgery and grab the superblock off of this first-half-of-the-disk dump and graft it onto the dump of the data partition, I might be able to tell `mount` where the hell my inode table is on the data dump.
[20:00:38] <river> gl!
[20:03:41] <gwozniak> kronk: woohoo!
[20:04:25] <kronk> finally some good news after two days. my office chair just exploded out from under me yesterday as well. some higher power really hates me lately.
[20:04:46] <gwozniak> When it rains, it pours
[20:18:35] <Geekingfrog> oÔ
[20:18:49] <Geekingfrog> how did it explode?
[20:19:25] <river> scary D:
[20:21:44] <kronk> Geekingfrog: it was one of those lean-back chairs and a screw sheered off.
[20:21:56] <kronk> the whole thing just split apart at that point.
[20:23:02] <Geekingfrog> damn, did you get hurt?
[20:23:49] <kronk> thankfully no.
[20:23:53] <kronk> chair's fucked though.
[20:24:00] <kronk> seems like everything is telling me to buy new shit.
[20:24:05] <kronk> that chair is like 15 years old.
[20:30:37] <Geekingfrog> I was surprised to learn that my parents have some chairs at home that are 40+ year old. It seems I'm too accustomed to shit breaking fast now :(
[20:32:14] <kronk> they certainly ain't made to last.
