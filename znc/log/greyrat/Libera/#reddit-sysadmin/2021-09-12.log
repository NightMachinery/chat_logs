[05:11:09] <corn266> okay
[05:12:45] * JollyRgrs rolls eyes
[05:12:56] <corn266> i actually want to show my musician dad how versatile the speakers and sub i have are, so i've been accumulating songs
[05:13:00] <JollyRgrs> but to be srs... that still would be risky... spotify might start recommending me songs b/c i clicked on your playlist, lol
[05:13:52] <corn266> JollyRgrs do you want an actual risky spotify song or are you justing saying
[05:13:59] <corn266> cause you shouldn't click on this https://open.spotify.com/track/2w09i8WQjzVIIPEcU3TJM4?si=9f6cc2b3280b4258
[05:14:41] <JollyRgrs> unless i know someone (and trust their taste), i usually just find the song on youtube and paste that

[05:19:37] <JollyRgrs> i'd suspect that what things you wanted to say in the early 2000s would still be things you shouldn't say
[05:19:38] <corn266> so JollyRgrs, what songs should i include to impress my dad of my sound system
