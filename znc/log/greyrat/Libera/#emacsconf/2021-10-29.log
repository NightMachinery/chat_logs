[17:22:27] <edgarvincent[m]> Hello! This year's Emacs Conf looks very exciting!
[17:23:40] <bandali> hey edgarvincent[m], indeed!
[17:24:51] <edgarvincent[m]> Not only do we have a great piece of software, but we also have a wonderful community.
[17:27:19] <edgarvincent[m]> I'm particularly curious about Laszlo Krajnikovszkij's talk. Wonder if he refers to a hypothetical project or if some work has been done. And of course Prot's, who is always brilliant.
[17:28:17] <edgarvincent[m]> Thanks a lot to the organisers, this event is really lovely.
[17:30:08] <bandali> thank you :)  indeed, it's looking to be an *awesome* emacsconf this year, thanks to the lineup of talks from our awesome speakers

[23:47:48] <pkal> I just finished a first iteration of my presentation, as it is just a bit over 6 minutes, would it be possible for someone to comment on what I could improve as there still is some time until the deadline?
[23:53:16] <grym> pkal: sure!
[23:53:30] <grym> but if you need to eat 4 minutes, just talk slightly slower :)
[23:54:23] <bandali> :) also if you like, myself and/or some other orgas would be happy to have a look and potentially give feedback, if you want to share it privately (to emacsconf-submit@ or emacsconf-org-private@)
[23:55:56] <zaeph> Also, bear in mind that a 10-min slot includes question time, so a shorter presentation would give you more time for questions.
[23:56:19] <zaeph> As such, the remaining 4 min aren't something that you desperately need to fill. :)
[23:56:42] <grym> ^ 
[23:56:54] <grym> a little slop is always kind of great for organizing 
[23:59:00] <petrichor> I've given a lot of talks over the years and one thing that I've never been given shit for is finishing sooner than planned ðŸ˜‚
[23:59:29] <grym> burbling on for 10 minutes over time, otoh 
[23:59:38] <grym> will get you quietly cursed at by the grad students
