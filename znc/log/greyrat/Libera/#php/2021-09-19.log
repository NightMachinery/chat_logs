[00:00:34] <TinoDidriksen> You know bloody well what I meant. PHP's behavior in this one aspect deviates badly from Posix expected behavior.
[00:00:45] <Blondie101010> PWD is also touchy, use a constant base
[00:00:51] <TML> <?php define("ROOT_DIR", $_SERVER['PWD']); include $ROOT_DIR . '/other/path.php';
[00:01:00] <Blondie101010> sure
[00:01:15] <TML> TinoDidriksen: POSIX doesn't have a concept of "__FILE__" or "__DIR__", so I'm not sure what you mean at all
[00:01:47] <TML> TinoDidriksen: PHP's __FILE__ and __DIR__ have an implicit realpath call applied, which absolutely, 100% **IS** a POSIX call
[00:01:52] <Blondie101010> TinoDidriksen:  did you compare with C?
[00:02:11] <Blondie101010> I haven't but doubt it will be different
[00:02:51] <TinoDidriksen> No other language or tool will realpath() includes in this fashion. They'll work in the symlink hierarchy, not the resolved one.
[00:03:18] <TML> Blondie101010: C's __FILE__ just gives the filename, not any path components
[00:03:34] <Blondie101010> __DIR__
[00:03:45] <TML> TinoDidriksen: That's because no other language has a concept that is intended to mean the same thing as what PHP's __FILE__ is intended to mean.

[00:04:03] <TML> Blondie101010: C doesn't have a __DIR__
[00:04:07] <TinoDidriksen> Symlinks are supposed to be transparent unless specifically asked for, and it is really bizarre that PHP's prime method for figuring out where "this file" is resolves the path.
[00:04:45] <TinoDidriksen> If I wanted to realpath() __DIR__ first, I would do so myself. The fact that I can't opt out of it is a griveous bug.
[00:06:01] <TinoDidriksen> There is no way to get the path to the symlinked file/folder, which is a huge problem.
[00:06:04] <TML> TinoDidriksen: Well, you're certainly entitled to your opinion. But to take that opinion and turn it into such a blatant mis-statement of facts as "PHP doesn't behave well with symlinks" is inexcusable. If you want to tell people "PHP's __FILE__ doesn't behave the way I think it should with symlinks", that's fine. But please skip the FUD here.
[00:06:05] <AllenJB> You could propose an RFC to change it (perhaps with an ini option - at least as a migration path)
[00:06:20] <Blondie101010> omg, I was sure C had __DIR__ (been too long)
[00:06:24] <Blondie101010> just checked
[00:06:35] <TML> Blondie101010: There may be C libraries which gave you a __DIR__
[00:06:36] <TinoDidriksen> There's been several bugs filed for this behavior, closed with "performance" reasons.
[00:06:55] <TML> Blondie101010: Or maybe a particular compiler quirk

[00:10:33] <TML> it's not even a very conceptually difficult piece of code to write
[00:10:47] <TinoDidriksen> I do that, but it's a hack that's only needed in PHP, because PHP provides no way to get the unresolved path. When you have hierarchies of libraries you want to share across projects, this makes it rather abysmal.
[00:11:24] <Blondie101010> not if you stop relying on __DIR__
[00:11:24] <TML> I don't find it the least bit "abysmal", but YMMV
[00:11:31] <TinoDidriksen> It should just work the way it works for all other tools and languages. Treat the symlinks as if they are the real files, unless specifically resolved by the client.
[00:11:59] <Blondie101010> I'd agree to put this as an option
[00:12:07] <Blondie101010> not more
[00:12:09] <TML> TinoDidriksen: What is another tool/language that even provides a __FILE__ or __DIR__? I just cannot fathom what you are comparing PHP to and wishing it behaved like.
[00:12:16] <TinoDidriksen> Even if you think PHP should autoresolve, surely you must agree there needs to be a way to get the unresolved path?
[00:12:46] <Blondie101010> why wouldn't it consider the real path to be proper?
[00:12:49] <TML> TinoDidriksen: Quite frankly, I do NOT agree, just beacuse it has never occured to me that I might need such a thing.
[00:13:16] <Blondie101010> a symlink is NOT the real path of the file
[00:13:36] <TML> I know that __FILE__ is meant to give me the realpath, and that there are a half-dozen other values which will give me the non-realpath, so it never occurred to me to wish that __FILE__ did something I never thought it should do
[00:14:09] <Blondie101010> either way, how it operates does determine how it should be used
[00:14:31] <Blondie101010> and such specifics are indeed language dependent
[00:17:08] <TinoDidriksen> It's not about whether other things provide __DIR__ or __FILE__ - it's about how nothing else will realpath() such paths unless you specifically ask for it. That PHP does it for you with NO way to get the unresolved original, makes it very hard to use symlinks to share code. Especially in hierarchies of libraries. e.g., if I want to replace a single file of a symlinked library, but that library
[00:17:08] <TinoDidriksen> uses __DIR__ to find relative files, that's impossible.
[00:18:52] <Blondie101010> you dislike/disagree with it, fine
[00:19:03] <Blondie101010> now that will not be changed by default for sure 20 years later
[00:19:06] <TML> it's definitely true that poorly written libraries using __DIR__ will cause you problems
[00:19:21] <TML> I don't see how that's something that should be fixed at the language layer
[00:19:49] <Blondie101010> TinoDidriksen:  the only solution I see for you is what I mentioned, to do a PR to set a special option not to get the real path
[00:20:50] <TinoDidriksen> I did fiddle with adding __UDIR__ and __UFILE__ a while back, but didn't finish it.
[00:20:54] <TML> the documentation is pretty damn clear that symlinks will be resolved, if people opt to use it knowing that's the case, I can't see how you make that PHP's problem - would it also be our fault if they explicitly called realpath() on it?
[00:21:23] <Blondie101010> it's obviously a matter of 3rd party stuff that he tries to reorganize
[00:22:15] <TinoDidriksen> Not just 3rd party stuff. Also my own code, where I every so often will symlink something and wonder why it doesn't find the files I expect it to find, and then I remember it's PHP and not literally anything else.
[00:22:40] <TML> I realize that, but that's my point - it's not a LANGUAGE problem that 3rd party developers opted to write code that is unfriendly to symlinks, any more than if the reason it was unfriendly was because they explicitly called realpath() and he were arguing we should break realpath()
[00:23:22] <TinoDidriksen> PHP should not realpath() for us, especially when it doesn't provide the unresolved path anywhere.
[00:23:41] <Blondie101010> do a PR for it :P
[00:23:46] <TML> TinoDidriksen: That's certainly one opinion
[00:24:08] <Blondie101010> I kinda like the __UDIR__
[00:24:08] <TML> TinoDidriksen: I'm of the opinion that the _only_ reason to ever call __FILE__ or __DIR__ is because I *want* the realpath.
[00:26:04] <TML> As for your other assertion, it's patently absurd; if I want the unresolved path, there are absolutely ways to get that information.
[00:26:10] <TML> You're just upset because you don't like them

[03:37:28] <Blondie101010> ok so it's firewalled
[03:38:33] <sebastianos> - user is able to connect via nc google.com 80

[13:55:54] <Jimmy2027> hi, I'm getting this error "PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted" when executing a command with /usr/bin/php. Since /usr/bin/php points to PHP 7.4.21, I have tried to increase the memory_limit in /etc/php/apache2-php7.4/php.ini, however I still get the same error. Does someone know why that could be?

[14:50:27] <TinoDidriksen> Jimmy2027, php cli does not read the web ini file.
[14:51:28] <TinoDidriksen> You can also run php -d memory_limit=8G file.php to set it on-the-fly.
[14:52:07] <TinoDidriksen> Jimmy2027, to find which ini files are loaded, run: php -i | grep ini
