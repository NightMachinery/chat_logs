[00:04:01] <dostoyevsky2> akik: on most hyperscalers that's a one liner like: cloud container clusters create example --machine-type=f1-micro --num-nodes=3 --scopes=cloud-platform --zone=us-west1-a

[00:05:03] <dostoyevsky2> but I've also implemented similar rest APIs for vultr.. which I use privately
[00:05:32] <artok> aws takes 2min to spin up that cluster?
[00:07:29] <akik> dostoyevsky2: what benefit do you get from that instead of running just kubernetes?
[00:08:33] <artok> I understand that, clean slate on each test run
[00:09:13] <akik> just provision the vm again, clean slate
[00:10:10] <artok> isn't that just it?
[00:10:38] <dostoyevsky2> akik: I can use any kind of stupid package without checking whether that breaks the integrity of the cluster... if I need a docker registry I can just use a random project from github like trow... I don't need to vet the code... If you have an existing k8s cluster, and decide you just install a service mesh on it, the admins of the other project might want to kill you
[00:13:43] <akik> dostoyevsky2: is this inside one docker container or multiple?
[00:13:49] <dostoyevsky2> akik: if you have the right permissions in a k8s cluster, you can just destroy it by talking to the master via rest requests, that's what cloud native is all about... you can provision any kind of resources, or dispose them if you have the right token for the api calls, so inside a k8s it's inherently insecure

[00:16:44] <dostoyevsky2> but if you can't use  stuff like `helm install elastic-search' for a test case.. then a lot of the simplificationss that k8s brings are not available to you... that's why it's best to see k8s as an ephemeral container itself

[00:57:16] <Lutin> akik have you hears about swam issues between nodes when containers are connecting to eachother ?
[00:57:51] <akik> Lutin: luckily no. but one issue was with the dns entries docker creates
[00:58:09] <akik> Lutin: docker adds the _ character into the hostnames which is not allowed by the spec
[00:58:42] <akik> i even have some remote swarm workers which have access to the user defined swarm networks
[00:58:45] <Lutin> akik I don't have that issue... I have timeout issues but I can telnet myself from container to container
[00:59:10] <akik> Lutin: using the dns names ?
[00:59:36] <Lutin> akik no the service/container logs to connect by IP
[01:00:06] <Lutin> also... when I have a replicated service one host is able to connect, the other isn't... I think because of local works
[01:00:16] <Lutin> it's really vague
[01:00:23] <akik> Lutin: i can use the docker dns hostnames for connections
[01:00:39] <Lutin> akik this is just ingress what does that

[05:34:29] <Lutin> tang^ what happen is that when I have 2 traefik containers replicated in a service only one node accepts the connection
[05:35:21] <tang^> how are networks supposed to work with swarm?
[05:36:42] <Lutin> tang^ overlay ?
[05:37:10] <tang^> right the overlay allows traffic to get between nodes
[05:37:16] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[05:37:20] <Lutin> so ?
[05:37:31] <tang^> how does swarm expect the traffic to reach it in the first place?
[05:37:31] <Lutin> what was your point ?
[05:37:44] <Lutin> ingress ?
[05:38:02] <tang^> traefik is your ingress?
[05:38:24] <Lutin> no... ingress does swarm traffic
[05:38:35] <Lutin> it does the routing mesh
[05:38:46] <tang^> where is the ingress running then?
[05:38:58] <tang^> on a single node, I'm guessing
[05:39:01] <Lutin> ingress is default running on swarm
[05:39:32] <Lutin> I thnk you didn't use it much indeed :)

[06:23:59] <Lutin> OK it's clear. between nodes it sees the route, timeout
[06:39:55] <Geo> I have two docker-compose files running- I'd like for a service configured in the first to be able to connect to a service defined in the second but so far I haven't had success. is there a specific 'thing' that needs to be done to allow hostnames (services) to be used instead of IPs?
[06:41:01] <Lutin> I have the feeling that with swarm it goes wrong on the second request.. that is where I get the timeout
[06:42:45] <lilgopher> I'm using this to see the logs from docker https://github.com/amir20/dozzle. Is there a better alternative that doesnt require much work to setup?
[06:44:40] <lilgopher> or maybe something that looks like the logs viewer in GCP, where is easy to find errors in the histogram
[06:50:52] <lilgopher> Geo why not one docker compose file but using profiles?
[06:51:42] <Geo> I'm unfamiliar with that concept; but I have lots of different 'things' that I don't think need/should be mixed together, they're often brought up and down independently of each other
[06:52:06] <Geo> I'm currently looking at the hostname command as a solution, haven't tried that yet
[06:52:15] <lilgopher> yeah, you can use profiles to run some services/jobs but not others
[06:52:57] <lilgopher> https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/
[06:53:30] <Geo> interesting
[06:56:40] <lilgopher> I have my db and cache without profile(those will always run), then service A has profiles "light", "medium" and "full",service B and C have profile "medium" and "full", and service D, E and F have "full". So when I run docker compose --profile full up, all services run, but if I only want db+cache+sercie A I run docker compose --profile light up
[06:57:14] <lilgopher> and to stop them you have to run "docker compose --profile full down", just docker compose down is not enough
[06:57:54] <Geo> that's really good to know for some other things I use; thanks
[06:58:01] <Geo> not sure that's what I'm looking for here
[06:58:35] <Geo> but I'm surprised/frustrated the answer to communicating inter-host isn't more obvious to me here
[06:59:22] <lilgopher> if they are in the same compose file the container name should be enough to use as host(either container name or service name, dont remember)
[06:59:27] <Geo> maybe i'll take one step back though; if no network is defined, all containers are joined to the same default network from different .yml files, correct?
[06:59:46] <lilgopher> from different files I dont know
[06:59:55] <lilgopher> I have them in the same file and use profiles
[07:01:35] <Geo> I'm looking at https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/ and I'm pretty sure the first paragraph there is telling me the answer, I'm just not quite following it
[07:01:36] <lilgopher> I guess the point of docker compose is running everything easy, without needing multiple commands

[22:43:45] <phisch> have you guys ever had a machine where exposed docker ports "all of a sudden" where unreachable from the host? i have a basic container that i want to run on multiple machines (webserver) and it runs on every one except one
[22:44:11] <phisch> that machine runs the same linux distro (arch) and same config as one of the other machines
[22:45:10] <phisch> the container starts properly, the process is listening on port 80 (or 8080 depending on how i test), but sending a request to it just doesn't return any response (timeout/not reachable)
[22:45:22] <artok> some people activate firewall management software and that flushes tables 
[22:46:34] *** night_wulfe_ is now known as night_wulfe
[22:51:56] <phisch> there is none of that on that machine, i am completely out of ideas
[22:56:06] <Lutin> phisch where does it run 
[22:56:07] <Lutin> ?
[22:56:34] <phisch> Lutin: local computer, or what do you mean exactly?
[22:57:02] <Lutin> phisch you run swarm ?
[22:57:19] <phisch> no, it's just a docker-compose file, but it doesn't matter, tried a plain docker command as well
[22:57:49] <phisch> all containers start properly, and they bind to the port, netstat even shows the process listening on the port, but when i actually try to communicate with it, it runs into a timeout
[22:58:07] <phisch> as if the packets just get dropped before they reach the process, i have no idea
[22:58:30] <phisch> and there is no firewall, no nothing, it's plain ass archlinux
[22:58:43] *** Quits: RougeR (~rougex250@user/rouger) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:59:20] <phisch> 99.9% identical to another machine i have here (they use the same arch installation script and have the same packages and configuration), yet this one just refuses to talk to docker containers out of nowhere (it worked in the past)
[22:59:41] <phisch> obviously i must have done something, but i have checked everything i could possibly think of

[23:13:06] <phisch> well, about to reinstall that machine, i need a working docker setup and i'm lost, never had that before in many years of using docker, usually it was my fault when something didn't work, but this time it surely isn't

[23:20:17] <Lutin> phisch what happens when you turn off the firewall ?
[23:21:33] <phisch> Lutin: you mean iptables?
[23:21:44] <Lutin> phisch ys
[23:22:12] <phisch> Lutin: same result when disabling iptables service
[23:22:38] <Lutin> yeah I don't know if forwarding works then :)
[23:23:15] <akik> docker just modifies iptables directly. it doesn't need any service
[23:23:25] <phisch> that's what i thought
[23:23:36] <phisch> anway, it's identical to another machine where it works properly
[23:23:41] <Lutin> akik no indeed, but testing without could be something :)
[23:24:33] <Lutin> akik wht could be blocked on LAN (no ports) when I get timeouts when things like traefik want to connect over an overlay network to another host ?
[23:25:50] <phisch> man, this is really annoying
[23:25:57] <akik> Lutin: does it work inside the containers?
[23:26:45] <akik> i.e. the connection between traefik and what you're testing
[23:27:03] <Lutin> akik I can telnet or curl indeed
[23:27:08] <Lutin> between them

[23:27:35] <Lutin> so from traefik to nginx. Also on the same host when I replicate traefik
[23:27:43] <akik> Lutin: maybe you haven't published the traefik port?
[23:28:14] <Lutin> akik what do you mean ?
[23:28:33] <Lutin> it works on node 1 to node one but not from node 2 to node 1
[23:28:35] <akik> Lutin: did you test accessing the service through traefik?
[23:28:50] <Lutin> yes, works using curl/telnet
[23:28:58] <phisch> i think he is confusing you for me, i am the one that can't communicate with the docker containers
[23:31:02] <phisch> and if so: no, the ports are exposed properly, the identical docker-compose.yml runs on my raspberry and my laptop but not my main pc
[23:31:08] <akik> i spent 12 hours some months ago setting up traefik
[23:31:43] <akik> and i have a custom iptables setup on the host so i'm probably not the best example trying to figure out why it's not working
[23:31:53] <phisch> i don't think you spent 12 hours setting it up, but mostly doing stuff that doesn't make sense while actually learning and slowly understanding better and then eventually getting it and setting it up
[23:32:38] <phisch> i love traefik btw
[23:32:45] <akik> it was all try, errror, fix
[23:33:20] <phisch> when you get a few basic concepts of it, then it becomes pretty easy, but before that it's just too much
[23:34:01] <Lutin> akik yeah but the same happens with caddy on the connect... it times out
[23:34:31] <phisch> i'll just reinstall the exact same software on my pc, and then docker is gonna work again, and i'll never figure out what went wrong here
[23:42:13] <Lutin> akik so it's no traefik issue
