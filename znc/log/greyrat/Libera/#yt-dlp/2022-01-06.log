[10:37:42] <pabs3> KombuchaKip: I note yt-dlp got into Debian itself now, so maybe update that PR to point at Debian
[10:38:05] <pabs3> (if you didn't already, or someone else didn't)
[10:38:31] <KombuchaKip> pabs3: Oh really? Very cool. You're talking about the one I submitted to yt-dlp?
[10:38:38] <pabs3> yeah
[10:39:02] <KombuchaKip> pabs3: Right on and very glad to hear that. That's a big milestone. The project's adoption will likely increase now.
[10:39:38] <pabs3> its in Debian bookworm (a bullseye backport is pending) and later, and presumably in Ubuntu too
[10:40:29] <KombuchaKip> pabs3: I wonder which Ubuntu release it will make its way into.
[10:41:11] <KombuchaKip> pabs3: Looks like it's slated for jammy.
[10:41:17] <pabs3> cool
[10:41:29] <KombuchaKip> pabs3: https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/yt-dlp
[10:42:35] <KombuchaKip> pabs3: Hah, Unit 193. He's always packaging cool stuff.
[10:42:52] <pabs3> yep
[10:43:17] <KombuchaKip> pabs3: I've been using a bunch of his xfce PPA packages for years.
[10:53:02] <JackFrost> I think he's a bit of an oddball myself.

[12:10:45] <JackFrost> yt-dlp is now in bullseye-backports too.  On next upload, mpv will recommend it.
