[00:01:30] <quanticle> Isn't MAPI the Exchange protocol?
[00:01:41] <quanticle> Er, the protocol that Outlook speaks with Exchange?
[00:02:01] <cb> not just that, you can impl your own MAPI drivers
[00:02:06] <cb> say someone invents a new mail protocol
[00:02:14] <cb> you write a mapi driver and outlook and friends start speaking it
[00:02:59] <quanticle> You say "Outlook and friends" as if Outlook has friends.
[00:03:15] <quanticle> It seems like a bunch of work to support Outlook
[00:03:25] <cb> MAPI was intended for other things too
[00:03:34] <cb> i.e. you could make your own clients, send mail through it, etc.
[00:03:39] <cb> alas, it wasn't rhe world we got
[00:05:34] <quanticle> Yeah, sure but why do we need yet another layer of abstraction here? I get why Outlook needs the abstraction: it's helpful to have a common interface that Outlook can use for both Exchange and traditional IMAP servers. But why should the rest of us, those of us who aren't concerned with Exchange, worry about MAPI?
[00:05:56] <cb> so you dont need to rawdog smtp to send an email from your app
[00:07:06] <quanticle> Right, I need to rawdog MAPI *and* rawdog a MAPI-to-SMTP driver. That's not better

[00:38:50] <epilys> use an smtp lib?
[00:42:00] <quanticle> Yeah, that's my point: if I'm using an SMTP lib anyway, what does the additional abstraction of MAPI get me?
[00:44:49] <cb> not smtp transports
[00:44:53] <cb> i.e. exchange but other shit

[00:48:04] <Brekkjern> Just watched The Death of Stalin, and I can't quite get this gif out of my head:

[00:48:05] <buttsbot> Death of Stalin lowkey fantastic : 196
[00:55:46] <epilys> what is that subreddit about?
[00:58:00] <Brekkjern> Not the faintest idea
[00:58:10] <Brekkjern> It was just the top result for the gif

[01:11:10] <quanticle> s/lowkey//
[01:11:24] <quanticle> The Death of Stalin is a great movie
[01:14:02] <gwozniak> Yeah, it was pretty good
[01:16:23] <bontaq> dang I keep meaning to watch that but never get around to it
[01:16:30] <bontaq> maybe today is the day!
[01:28:56] <Brekkjern> I just did
[01:29:06] <Brekkjern> I thought it was decent
[01:41:27] <gwozniak> I held off on watching it because I thought my wife would hate it, but that turned out to not be the case

[01:47:49] <Brekkjern> This video is fun
[01:52:11] <Brekkjern> Related, I'm trying to watch that video through a chromecast, and the video is constantly slightly laggy, but the ad is smooth as butter
[01:53:48] <epilys> probably the encoding
[01:54:30] <epilys> hardware accelerated vs not
[01:56:18] <Brekkjern> Nah. YT just doesn't want to buffer the video more than a second
[01:56:46] <Brekkjern> But the ad? Why not just grab the entire ad at once?
[01:57:10] <quanticle> And this is why I youtube-dl everything
[01:57:17] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:58:26] <epilys> ad might be cached
[02:01:25] <Brekkjern> Maybe, but that's my point... They won't let me cache more than a second of the video at a time

[16:21:28] <Church> God damnit if I'm not tempted to apply for an SRE position with wikimedia
[16:22:22] <epilys> are you SREing now Church?
[16:22:32] <Church> I am indeed
[16:22:40] <Church> Kinda~
[16:22:58] <Church> General infrastructure engineer/sysadmin dogsbody
[16:23:34] <epilys> wikimedia SRE sounds cool indeed
[16:23:43] <epilys> I'd apply if I wasn't more inclined in development
[16:24:02] <Church> Aye, I'd apply if I wasn't happy where I was heh.
[16:24:29] <Church> Plus my work will no doubt change more as our merge continues on and on. So that'll be exciting.
[16:24:37] <Church> Probably got a couple of years here still.
[17:10:40] <epilys> your merge?
[17:25:00] <Church> Err, merger*
[18:39:59] <epilys> ah
[18:46:51] <gwozniak> I remapped my keyboard a bit and now I'm in the "getting used to it" stage
