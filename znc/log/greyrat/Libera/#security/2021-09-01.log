[00:10:00] <lind{at}yahoo> an intelligence operative I work with just gave me something extremely alarming: an account on Telegram claiming to be McAfee official posted 100s of photosets that seem to demonstrate massive child sexual abuse among élite allied actors. For example there is a photo of Obama in the oval kissing a 12 y/o girl on the neck with her on his lap and photo next to that of what appears to be the same girl in bondage. The photos
[00:10:00] <lind{at}yahoo> are all technically legal in the US but they provided a decrypt key claiming 31+TB of data just like that. I am not going to post this publicly but if any of you have access to deep fake detection methodology at high throughput this is something that needs to be verified. A deep fake of this magnitude would seem to take a large team years with access to billions in private compute power: John could not have done that without

[03:02:56] <godSend23> hey all
[03:03:00] <Hash> Database stuff
[03:03:31] <bewees> Hi, I want to use rtorrent and I wonder if it is better to run it on a VPS instead of inside my home network as there will be tons of random peers which may make monitoring with a NIDS more difficult as there is more noise, or should I not worry about that as this should be configurable to ignore in the logs?
[03:04:15] <Hash> They used to have seedboxes etc for stuff like this

[03:05:04] <secbot> https://proprivacy.com/guides/torrent-safe Download to a sandbox environment. This is an elevated security precaution that most people will probably not need to take. However, if you do often download executable files (computer programs) from torrent repositories then it is a very good idea to protect yourself in this way.
[03:05:07] <bewees> seedbox is even unsafer than a VPS because you rely on someone else doing the configuration
[03:05:22] <Hash> You can set you own box
[03:05:29] <Hash> It's just a term, doesn't matter who runs it.
[03:05:29] <bewees> Yeah that is what I meant with VPS
[03:07:26] <Hash> You could also get a vps, run vpn, use rtorrent locally.
[03:07:27] <bewees> I wonder how well snort can discard the noise traffic of highly fluctuating peers for a specific client

[03:08:30] <bewees> Mhm
[03:09:55] <bewees> I think I go for that, run rtorrent in a VM, exclude the traffic for that specific port rtorrent runs on

[03:13:22] <bewees> Yeah, will also use firejail additionally inside the VM for rtorrent and either create disposable VMs or jump back to a snapshot here and then for a known secure state

[21:47:01] <tesseract> anyone?
[21:47:23] <tesseract> who can answer my question?
[21:48:19] <ajak> if you connect to something on the internet with a plaintext connection your ISP can see the plaintext, sure
[21:49:06] <tesseract> ajak: have you checked the guide? :D
[21:49:13] <ajak> no
[21:49:54] <tesseract> what i'm asking is actually if it sends traffic to internet first
[21:50:16] <ajak> .. if you connect to it over the internet
[21:50:45] <tesseract> or is it a traffic between pc and android on the same network
[21:51:04] <ajak> if the traffic doesn't go over the internet, then it doesn't go over the internet

[21:52:19] <tesseract> ajak: yes. that's what i want to know. if the setting in guide does that or not

[21:54:34] <TimMc> tesseract: It's hard to tell from your question.
[21:54:54] <TimMc> Are you trying to have one device on your home network talk to another device on your home network?
[21:55:08] <ajak> as far as i can tell opening a relay in weechat just opens a port in weechat, and doesn't actually connect to anything itself
