[00:51:53] <ButterNoodle> maybe I am lost on ur english
[00:52:06] <ButterNoodle> clarify
[00:54:06] <HeTo> well, you said Windows 98 looked better in 640x480, I basically said that any Windows 98 computer could do better than that resolution
[00:54:49] <ButterNoodle> "where is a Windows 98 computer not capable" ic
[00:58:10] <emmeka> most actual early Windows games were designed for VGA (640x480) graphics though
[00:58:25] <emmeka> Quake was famously programmed on a 1080p CRT monitor, though
[01:00:11] <emmeka> but it's true that higher resolutions than VGA have existed since well before modern Windows did and most hardware could and did run higher resolutions for basic computing
[01:00:21] <HeTo> right, but when you're playing a game at full screen, it doesn't matter what the desktop looks like or what it would look like at that resolution
[01:01:29] *** Quits: volki57 (~volki57@95.70.134.1) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[01:01:49] <emmeka> CRT monitors were neat in the way they fully supported lower resolutions than their maximum resolution perfectly, not like modern fixed pixel displays which have to do blurry scaling
[01:03:08] <emmeka> so long as the aspect ratio was the same or the monitor could support underscanning to windowbox different aspect ratios
[01:05:57] <HeTo> you could use non-square pixels as well. granted, not so great if the graphics were designed assuming square pixels
[01:06:26] <HeTo> but on PCs, pixels were non-square for a long time
[01:06:40] <HeTo> and not just IBM PCs

[17:39:55] <NotNew> other attractions I should say
[17:40:19] <NotNew> japan so cool in that they keep their own culture, every other country is semi westernized or dyspotic. 
[17:40:21] <amigojapan> NotNew: people also come for martial arts
[17:40:34] <NotNew> like joe rogan
[17:40:55] <emmeka> NotNew Japan is, if anything, the country on earth most guilty of bastardized westernization
[17:41:17] <emmeka> Japanese culture and society is ecclectic, having taken elements from the west and done with them as they please
[17:41:40] <NotNew> well if they didnt westernized they wouldn't have been able to dominate whole pacific during WW2 or have worlds 3rd largest economy eh
[17:42:08] <emmeka> well yes
[17:42:15] <NotNew> hy history teacher said it multiple times
[17:42:21] <emmeka> but I don't see how that changes the point
[17:42:42] <NotNew> they went from pretty isolated to pretty much fully industrialized in less than 100 years
[17:42:49] <NotNew> where our country couldnt even manage it in 300 years xD
[17:43:59] <emmeka> Japan is perhaps the most westernized yet non-western nation on earth, having directly imported political and economic structures  (sometimes by choice, sometimes not) from the west as well as ideologies, concepts, beliefs and policies.
[17:45:16] <NotNew> what percentage of japanese have adopted mainstream international religions i wonder
[17:45:35] <emmeka> I don't think that's a question that jives well with how the Japanese treat religion
[17:46:02] <NotNew> and how is that 
[17:46:54] <emmeka> I'd say the typical approach is like most things in Japanese society, eclectic. Your average Japanese isn't a believer or subscriber to any one faith but just takes elements of them they happen to like.
[17:47:39] <emmeka> which is how Japan manages to have 2 primary religions (buddhism and shinto) and yet most of the population not being specifically committed to either, and many practising tenets of both.
[17:47:57] <darkwitch> get married at a shinto shrine and buried at a buddhist temple
[17:48:11] <emmeka> NotNew but, there is a very old and very sizeable Catholic minority in Japan, at least.
[17:48:54] <emmeka> darkwitch apparently something like 3/4 of Japanese get married in Christian churches
[17:49:04] <Poeticode> boooo religion
[17:49:09] <emmeka> why? because marriages happen in churches in the west!

[17:50:30] <emmeka> it's that kind of shit that's how Japan rolls. Just take random elements of western society, bastardize it however they like, incorporate it into their own culture.

[18:25:55] <emmeka> basically being minorly inconvenienced by someone else's use of a public road, which are commonly owned and that all are permitted to use at their discretion, is not criminal.
[18:26:32] <emmeka> anymore than it's criminal for traffic jams to exist as Jigsy points out, or criminal to move oversized traffic, or criminal to have parades
[18:28:25] <amigojapan> emmeka: except for parades, none of those things are purposely done in order to block roads. Parades are usually scheduled
[18:28:30] <MootPoot> can we make it criminal to have truck nuts

[18:29:36] <NotNew> they are blocking one of the main bridges that carries trade between canada and the US
[18:29:59] <NotNew> about 30% of trade with US is done via the bridge they are blocking, so lots of corporations are losing millions every day.

[22:42:59] <MootPoot> I dont really get what a keyring is but
[22:43:01] <MootPoot> its a thing
[22:43:18] <MootPoot> is it like some system level password manager?
[22:43:26] <ButterNoodle> tldl all packages are signed w pgp keys.. and the maintainers list is always changing
[22:43:36] <ButterNoodle> because arch
[22:44:10] <MootPoot> my arch system now uses like 13gb of ram
[22:44:11] <ButterNoodle> best and easy practice is to do a -Sy, then -S archlinux-keyring, then -Suy
[22:44:19] <ButterNoodle> what did u do?
[22:44:21] <ButterNoodle> install chrome
[22:44:46] <ButterNoodle> u switched WM/DE didnt u
[22:44:58] <MootPoot> no, still using plasma

[22:45:13] <MootPoot> basically
[22:45:14] <MootPoot> lmao
[22:45:17] <ButterNoodle> thats not xfce4
[22:45:20] <MootPoot> not chrome but I started using my stuff
[22:45:25] <ButterNoodle> ic

[22:45:34] <ButterNoodle> whats htop tell u?
[22:45:46] <MootPoot> 3-4 electron apps, cura, 20-30 tabs 
[22:45:47] <MootPoot> etc
[22:45:53] <MootPoot> yeah, thats what htop says
[22:45:54] <MootPoot> 13gb
[22:45:58] <MootPoot> swap is stil lempty
[22:46:05] <ButterNoodle> thats fine

[22:46:15] <MootPoot> 7700HQ is really showing its age tbh

[22:47:09] <ButterNoodle> I have a i5-6300
[22:47:15] <ButterNoodle> and it idles
[22:47:24] <ButterNoodle> ofc I dont have 30 tabs open
[22:47:34] <MootPoot> tbh I still haven't removed all of my old xfce4 stuff
[22:47:35] <ButterNoodle> tabs > vm's
[22:47:37] <MootPoot> its still installed
[22:47:40] <ButterNoodle> that dont matter
[22:47:46] <ButterNoodle> just drive space
[22:48:12] <MootPoot> I found a AUR app that lets me bind my logitch mouse keys and stuff
[22:48:18] <ButterNoodle> nice!
[22:48:21] <MootPoot> so the ONLY issue I have left is my windows key not properly
[22:48:29] <ButterNoodle> thats X
[22:48:35] <ButterNoodle> u can set shortcuts
[22:48:36] <MootPoot> working*
[22:48:44] <MootPoot> X11?
[22:48:52] <ButterNoodle> there are a lot of windows key combos
[22:49:04] <ButterNoodle> so u cant just bind windows key to pop the menu
[22:49:08] <MootPoot> well, the windows + arrow works fine for snapping windows
[22:49:11] <ButterNoodle> I've had problems
[22:49:20] <MootPoot> my problem is just pressing windows does not open up the application menu
[22:49:25] <ButterNoodle> I bound win+z to pop menu
[22:49:33] <MootPoot> where do you bind it?
[22:49:37] <emmeka> on xfce this is easy to fix, but what, you on KDE?
[22:49:45] <MootPoot> I'm a KDE plasma degenerate
[22:49:47] <MootPoot> now
[22:49:47] <ButterNoodle> idk what its called
[22:50:00] <ButterNoodle> I'll look in a min, gotta poop and finish clipping nails
[22:50:22] <MootPoot> before it was opening it on the wrong monitor so I deleted that taskbar and recreated it - in hopes it would change to the other monitor ( main middle one )
[22:50:34] <MootPoot> but now pressing the windows key itself does fuckall
[22:51:06] <emmeka> also it's clearly the Tux key. rid yourself of Microsoft brain parasites.
[22:51:16] <MootPoot> it has a windows logo on it
[22:51:24] <MootPoot> hence its the windows key :3
[22:51:37] <emmeka> pretend that doesn't exist
[22:51:47] <MootPoot> lol
[22:51:49] <emmeka> for the sake of Freedom
[22:52:22] * MootPoot joins the trucker convoy with a sign saying "Tux keys for freedom!"
[22:53:46] <Jigsy> "Keep on Truckin'!"
[22:55:30] <emmeka> MootPoot for me at least (xfce) I can just go into Settings>Keyboard>Application shortcuts and then there's one for xfce4-popup-applicationsmenu which by default seems to be Alt+F1, but I can just change it there.
[22:56:18] <emmeka> but really what is the purpose of this shortcut, it's on screen to click at all times already
[22:56:54] <emmeka> seems more useful to bind it to pop up a terminal window or something
[22:58:59] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: dont u have an app called "keyboard"
[22:59:24] <ButterNoodle> idk what the plasma menu popup is called tho
