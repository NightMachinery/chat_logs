[00:04:21] <phrik> Title: kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source tree (at git.kernel.org)
[00:05:12] <seventyfour> ok. i'll work on getting these undone and see if that make a difference!
[00:05:26] <seventyfour> building takes me a while too...
[00:05:47] <Warepire> Hopefully it will make a difference, the comment in the second commit makes it a very good candidate

[00:07:39] <Tamwyn> there doesn't seem to be a bugreport for element. However the bugtracker is severely broken (all is tracked via element-web) and the last bugreport i filed for element has never gotten a response.

[00:09:54] <Tamwyn> is it adviseable to file a bugreport in the arch tracker first to probably clarify whether it is an upstream issue or electron interplay vodoo?

[00:25:45] <libh> Is running arch linux a bad idea for any production workstation? I just want the latest stable packages and arch linux seems to fit the bill. Yet red hat and SUSE is way more popular for enterprise use. Just wondering.
[00:26:12] <Warepire> libh: Been running Arch on my work machine since 2018, no issues yet.

[00:28:15] <libh> Thing is, in a hypothetical scenario if I was looking for an arch linux admin, I'm second guessing it because pranksters and numbskulls would waste my time with I use arch btw joke applications.

[08:57:57] <ds> if there's an aur version, it has a pkgbuild. you might be able to modify it to work with a more recent version
[08:58:44] <bluehoney> i just need to look more then :p but then with the pkgbuild i can use that with pacman?

[16:58:59] <TheDcoder> Hi, I want to add a new custom entry in GRUB for my linux-zen kernel with different kernel cmdline params, but I can't seem to figure it out :-/
[16:59:20] <TheDcoder> I am reading the GRUB articles in the wiki but I can't really find a good way to do that
[16:59:35] <TheDcoder> what would be the ideal way to do it?
[17:00:06] <SysGhost> alad: Not that I'm aware of. latest one from the arch repos.
[17:00:22] <alad> SysGhost: I mean, did you try if downgrading makes the problem go away
[17:01:31] <TheDcoder> nvm, I think I got it
[17:01:42] <SysGhost> Going to try the -fresh ones instead. if that fails time to downgrade until it starts working again.
[17:01:57] * SysGhost currently uses the -still packages
[17:02:40] <TheDcoder> ...isn't downgrading packages illegal in Arch?
[17:02:54] <Khorne> Rules are made to be broken
[17:03:32] <Khorne> (Also yes, it puts you in a state of partial upgrade)
[17:03:46] <Scimmia> not illegal, but will cause problems. In this case, libreoffice uses poppler, so downgrades are unlikely to run

[17:09:27] <MacGyver> SysGhost: Sounds like now you're at least on par with mpan.
[17:09:37] <Khorne> TheDcoder, Linux doesn't ship a GRUB config
[17:09:41] <grawity> TheDcoder: it's not shipped with the kernel in any way
[17:09:42] <Khorne> Grub ships a GRUB config
[17:09:52] <TheDcoder> Got it, thanks
[17:09:59] <grawity> TheDcoder: mostly it's GRUB itself that ships with a bunch of shellscripts (in /etc/grub) that try to find kernels in /boot

[17:13:07] <grawity> the *other* .efi file that comes with systemd and has "boot" in its name is just an EFI stub
[17:13:10] <MacGyver> And reboot into firmware is added by default I think.

[18:27:45] <jelle> wow
[18:27:49] <MrElendig> TheDcoder: 2gb is too little really
[18:28:06] <MrElendig> TheDcoder: and the 2gb was supposed to be 30
[18:28:11] <TheDcoder> yup, my Pi is 4 GB and I got it about a year ago
[18:28:26] <MrElendig> then bumped to 35
[18:28:36] <TheDcoder> MrElendig: Right, but electronics are expensive in India due to all kinds of crazy taxes
[18:28:37] <ds> MrElendig: saw you mentioned node 304 - i sure do miss that case! smallest I could find that'd fit a full ATX PSU *and* decent (for the time) GPU
[18:28:45] <ds> components were a right snug fit but it sure looked fancy

[20:25:53] <ds> Dumb question time. If I have an i7 4790K (haswell refresh / devils canyon), which drivers should I be using? Seems wiki wording updated since I installed them (so >=2yrs apparently). It's HD Graphics 4600, but not on the compat list for intel-media-driver so I guess I need the "GMA 4500" libva-intel-driver instead?
