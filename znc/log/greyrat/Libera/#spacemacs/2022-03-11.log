[01:14:04] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai_gitlab> Okay... so that works... now I should switch to the Spacemacs channel
[01:15:44] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai_gitlab> Okay... so it connects to (opens buffers for) all 'available' channels
[01:17:00] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai_gitlab> But that was very easy to connect... I am typing this from Spacemacs now
[01:18:05] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Awesome! @dalanicolai_gitlab
[01:18:56] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Yes cool! But I am not sure how to scroll to older messages... or search... or how threads work etc.
[01:19:37] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I tried to connect using `erc`, following the instructions, but I think my token didn't work *or* inputting my GitHub username (`bryce-carson`) when `erc` prompted me for a name/nick did not work, because the instructions on `irc.gitter.im` say to use `/NICK`.

I didn't connect using SSL. I need to use `erc-ssl`, I think.
[01:26:01] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai_gitlab> There exists an ERC layer already

[21:20:46] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> will it work to create an alias? `prettier` can mean different things in different projects, that's why its hidden behind `npx`
[21:21:46] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> how's that related to alias
[21:22:35] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you're not writing shell script
[21:22:40] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> well I guess an alias isn't a path either. I'm surprised that this variable expects a file and only a file
[21:23:03] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> read the source code if you're suprised
[21:23:27] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But I think we can fix that in the Emacs client
[21:24:45] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> no there's nothing to fix
[21:24:53] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you should add it to the PATH
[21:25:13] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> or you should specify the full path to it
[21:25:33] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> I don't want to specify `/path/to/really/specific/node_modules/bin/prettier` that will be wrong for every second project I am in
[21:26:02] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> I don't want that in my path either... is there not an emacs-standard way of specifying a prefix or something like that?
[21:26:03] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> why is prettier not installed globally
[21:26:52] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> it is at the moment because I tried to simplify setup just to get ti to work. However `npm -g` still hides the executable behind `npx`
[21:27:16] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> no you're not simplifying anything
[21:28:08] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> prettier is not a library
[21:28:16] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's okay to install it globally
[21:28:58] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if you really want you can use something like nvm and install if in a virtual environment
[21:29:11] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Yeah we can.
[21:29:29] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> tools like that are frequently installed differently in different projects because different projects work with different tools/versions. It sounds liek you just haven't run across this school of htought
[21:29:31] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but it's still not per-project
[21:29:38] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Why is it painful? I think its good, but im not a maintainer
[21:30:13] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> n/r/whatever-vm is one way of doing things. It's not the trend that I'm describing now.
[21:30:21] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> > Why is it painful? I think its good, but im not a maintainer ‚èé  ‚èé For example when you reply to me I cannot see who wrote it....
[21:30:37] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Im hacking on `gitter.el` today. Started last night. Made a fork, and a spacemacs branch.
[21:30:46] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> > It's not the trend that I'm describing now. ‚èé  ‚èé Good luck
[21:30:56] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> anyway, I will stop bothering you and link to it globally until that stops working
[21:31:58] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> @lebensterben ,I see. I was in a thread. That may be why..
[21:32:03] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Could be the iOS client?
[21:32:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> yes that's all caused by the shitty iOS client!!!
[21:32:46] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> my own message is missing. And I cannot see who replied to me.
[21:32:55] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I'm doing a lot of guess works.
[21:40:13] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have been hacking on it also... I have implemented avatars in my fork (avatars make it easier for me to find/scan messages
[21:40:46] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It is great we can use  swoop-like functionality to search for messages
[22:01:09] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that sounds nice
[22:16:56] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Nice!
[22:17:53] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> The Gitter API provides a way to get previous messages, so we should implement that. On opening a room it should fetch the past, maybe, 20 messages, and provide an easy way to get more history.
[22:18:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I agree... was looking into that now
[22:18:45] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> FWIW, @lebensterben, the Android client has its issues too.
[22:18:55] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I think 50 or 100 messages is fine too
[22:19:08] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> as you simply scroll to the latest
[22:19:21] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> but then it is easy to swiper through them
[22:19:22] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Indeed.
[22:19:38] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Have you looked at the FIXMEs yet?
[22:20:04] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But getting the `unread` functionality and the `mentioned` functionality is a (quite) a little more work
[22:20:27] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > Have you looked at the FIXMEs yet? ‚èé  ‚èé not really
[22:20:33] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Will take a look
[22:21:35] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I refactored the gitter defun last night, moving the room list into the let of the main function, since its only used there and its an easy, really easy, way to fetch an updated room list.
[22:22:57] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Have you observed a random user's name appearing in your room list? I do on both of my machines, and as far as I recall I have never interacted with this person one-to-one on Gitter.
[22:23:07] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But it should stay a general Emacs client... not a Spacemacs client
[22:23:11] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Strsngely, it is the same person on both of my machines.
[22:23:29] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Sure. We can make a layer for our own purposes.
[22:24:25] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> If you do experience the same issue as me with a user appearing in your room list, is it Said √ñzcan for you as well?
[22:24:40] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > Have you observed a random user's name appearing in your room list? I do on both of my machines, and as far as I recall I have never interacted with this person one-to-one on Gitter. ‚èé  ‚èé No... all known users here
[22:25:05] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Okay, but it is showing your one-on-ones, as it should.
[22:26:55] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > If you do experience the same issue as me with a user appearing in your room list, is it Said √ñzcan for you as well? ‚èé  ‚èé Maybe you forgot that he has messaged you once before... long time ago
[22:27:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I am not sure if we should stay spamming the 'room' here... or create a new room
[22:28:12] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It is slightly relevant to users here maybe also
[22:28:16] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But not very
[23:17:39] *** Quits: Unicorn_Princess (~Unicorn_P@46-54-248-191.static.kate-wing.si) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:27:18] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I accidentally left the room! üòÜ
[23:29:42] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> @dalanicolai, can you create a community for `gitter.el`, associate it with your repository, and make a room and invite me? We can discuss development on `gitter.el` there.
