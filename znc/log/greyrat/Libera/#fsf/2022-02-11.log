[10:58:36] <DiffieHellman> AwesomeAdam54321: Not really. A single bit flip means that you lose a block, but it seems that a block is 16 bytes, so you just lose 16 bytes (LUKS probably reports to the FS driver that x bytes are corrupted).

[11:00:19] <DiffieHellman> The thing to look out for is to backup the LUKS header, as you lose the lot if all the keys in the header are corrupted. 
[11:03:06] <AwesomeAdam54321> DiffieHellman: So does that mean it's possible to use a LUKS header from a different location, or does it have to be at the same spot?
[11:04:16] <DiffieHellman> You can tell LUKS to use a detached header, but typically you can just copy it over. The header does some have some redundancy mind you,
[11:05:52] <DiffieHellman> Ah yeah, LUKS in XTS mode doesn't care about integrity and will just return the changed 16 bytes without noticing.

[13:08:42] <Andrew> <https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html> FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD all include instructions for obtaining nonfree programs in their ports system. In addition, their kernels include nonfree firmware blobs.
[13:08:55] <Andrew> OpenBSD doesn't include blobs, haven't seen promoting nonfree, will see
[13:09:13] <Andrew> Nonfree firmware programs used with Linux, the kernel, are called “blobs,” and that's how we use the term. In BSD parlance, the term “blob” means something else: a nonfree driver. OpenBSD and perhaps other BSD distributions (called “projects” by BSD developers) have the policy of not including those. That is the right policy, as regards drivers; but when the developers say these
[13:09:16] <Andrew> distributions “contain no blobs,” it causes a misunderstanding. They are not talking about firmware blobs.

[22:58:13] <seabass_> hello craigt, zleap!
[22:58:13] <duncan-nz> So I feel like the osarch project should be collaborating with someone on a more generic and open way to categorize and present a software directory.

[22:59:09] <tfisgnag> seabass_ Thank you!
[23:00:37] <thomzane> Someone should make FSD pages for the gearhead games.  https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Gearhead https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Gearhead_2
[23:00:40] <duncan-nz> craigt: yeah, irc has limits. I'd love to talk more. I can't get a good picture of the state of the fsd from reading that page. It sounds like there have been interesting ideas - but isn't the fsd still just a mediawiki?
[23:00:54] <craigt> seabass_: I welcomed tfisgnag earlier! :)
[23:00:54] <seabass_> tfisgnag: a little suggestion from me - PostmarketOS is a project to create a free and privacy-respecting OS for mobile phones. They are super friendly so might be a community to join :)
[23:00:57] <thomzane> Isn't osarch just a mediawiki?

[23:08:16] <thomzane> The FSD specifically uses Semantic MediaWiki.  https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/
[23:12:07] <David_Hedlund> thomzane: I added that to the page, thanks.
[23:14:00] <duncan-nz> I'd love to continue this conversion but ive got to go. I will read more about semantic mediawiki.

[23:24:14] <kataphusin> Hi everyone. Does anyone have advice on how to switch to a free software OS?
[23:25:30] <seabass_> kataphusin: I made that decision about three years ago, and it went really well! Is there any specific thing you'd like advice on, or just general suggestions?
[23:26:30] <kataphusin> seabass_ the computer I have is not compatible. I checked on H-Node, but I already know that the sound card works terribly on the Linux OS I am currently - temporarily! - using.
[23:27:06] <kataphusin> Sorry, *GNU/Linux...
[23:27:19] <craigt> kataphusin: You came to the right place.
[23:27:33] <kataphusin> :phew:
[23:27:41] <seabass_> oh dear! I've also has issued with sound cards. THey're difficult to get right, and not very many manufacturers want to support Linux drivers, much less make them free.

[23:29:23] <craigt> tfisgnag: I thought I replied. Would you mind sending it again?

[23:30:41] <kataphusin> I hadn't heard of Focusrite. I think that PureOS seems to be active on the hardware front.

[23:37:52] <tfisgnag> Sorry it would be 14:38 EST. I believe I am  using libera's and kiwi's web client.
[23:38:38] <seabass_> oh, I am very suprised! Intel are usually pretty good at supporting the free drivers.
[23:40:16] <kataphusin> I guess I lucked out :( The sound screeches on group video software..
[23:40:29] <craigt> tfisgnag: Unfortunately, I am not familiar with Kiwi. I wonder if the red ball is a status marker if I was also using Kiwi as a client.
[23:41:18] <kataphusin> As a person who does not yet know how to compile packages, I am wondering if I could feasibly patch things together on a free software OS until I can get new hardware.
[23:41:34] <tfisgnag> craigt: Have you tried PM me today ?
[23:42:07] <seabass_> kataphusin: you could use a package from another distro, if they are compatible
[23:42:11] <craigt> tfisgnag: I just did.
[23:42:25] <craigt> tfisgnag: I did not try earlier.
[23:42:28] <Noisytoot> seabass_: Not many distros have compatible packages.
[23:42:41] <Noisytoot> seabass_: And even if they do, it's likely to cause dependency issues.
[23:43:08] <seabass_> well, put it this way - it's more likely to be compatible than with manually compiling kernel modules
[23:44:00] <kataphusin> What I am worried about is what I need to get the computer to work. Almost all of the software I use (actually, it might be all of it now) is free software.
[23:44:22] <kataphusin> So, I am worried about wifi, the sound card, etc.
