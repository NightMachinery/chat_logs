[14:13:05] <rabbitnightmare> from what my basic understanding is you have to disable rasterization and vulkan temporarily but this causes other headaches
[14:13:12] <rabbitnightmare> theres fixes being made
[14:13:22] <raster> i actually would love to have the kernel's drm api + mesa have better memory tracking data you can inspect - e.g. track what memory mappings are user by which process for gpu usage and are they mapped from video mem or in system mem (and is the system mem mapped to the gpu over pcie) and what is that mem used for (textures, render buffers, shaders, etc. etc.) so you could actually trace this over time from outside 
[14:13:22] <raster> processes to see what might be going on, but that doesn't really exist right now.

[16:13:00] <MacGyver> Considering setting it up might become quite a bit more involved than just "installing the driver", that's the extent pacman can help you.

[16:17:14] <Hackerpcs> yes, 1.110/1.120

[17:01:12] <jelle> who knows, nordvpn is not your friend :)
[17:01:26] <quequotion> I have a package building question. Does makechrootpkg install optdepends() when building, or is there some way to explicitly tell it to do so? note: package in question is imagescan, which I want to build with png support and I am curious about the optional dependency tesseract

[17:04:26] <jelle> quequotion: optdepends are not installed by default, so you have to add it to makedepends
[17:04:27] <Khorne> quequotion, I don't think so, since they're..well..optional

[17:04:50] <Khorne> But also is it buildtime required?

[17:05:25] <quequotion> Khorne, that I do not know. Will have to build it without first to see (doing that now anyway).
[17:05:45] <Khorne> optdepends always confuses me

[17:06:05] <BrainDamage> optdepends is for runtime
[17:06:18] <BrainDamage> unfortunately, there's no way to specify opt depends for build time
[17:06:19] <Khorne> If it's needed during buildtime and runtime it should be depends, if it's only..yea
[17:06:41] <Khorne> BrainDamage, makes sense because then you would maybe also need to dynamically add configure options or whatever

[21:28:56] <Hackerpcs> very hacky but I was able to make a torrent from the files that I need to transfer, add the .110 as peer and it's transferred via the wired connection normally with qBittorent which can bind to specific NIC in settings
[21:28:58] <zbe> Hackerpcs, if you don't want to change metrics you could try using firejail to force specific nic
[21:29:21] <lgp171188> After a recent clean reinstall of Arch Linux + KDE Plasma on my desktop, some keybindings are no longer working as expected in Konsole. The 'delete' key didn't delete the character and I had to fix it by adding a bindkey statement in my ~/.zshrc. Now I found that the Alt + <arrow keys> doesn't work on byobu over a remote SSH session. Is there a way I can investigate and fix this issue cleanly?
