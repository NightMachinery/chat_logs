[04:50:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> One gets the best texture and crumb from a long rise (after shaping), to let the bubbles within the bread's structure develop fully. But it is easy to be tempted to bake early - the dough may rise to its full proper height before that internal bubble structure is ready, and if allowed to rise further, may overflow the loaf pan...
[04:50:43] <quanticle> gwern: Wait, is this trip to Eleuthera or w/e actually happening?
[04:51:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a trick of the dough, made possible by large bubbles at the top of the loaf - which are undesirable in any case, as they'll cause the upper crust to separate from the main body of the loaf!
[04:52:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> The solution? Take a skewer or toothpick, and poke the dough shallowly, bursting large bubbles at the surface. Then let it rise some more.
[04:52:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> After doing this 2-3 times, THEN when the dough achieves its proper height - its insides will be ready.
[04:52:44] <gwern> quanticle: yes, I think. the solution to my test paperwork woes seems to be driving out to town to buy the last athome test kit from cvs after 2 hours of research with oliver et al, and then paying a video service $20 to watch me use it on myself and then they'll email me the bullshit PDF I need for the bahamas website form which I apparently will need just to board the plane at 10AM tomorrow...

[04:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ok, I guess you make a persuasive point...
[05:00:39] <Ralith> Obormot\Arcturus: it sounds like your sourdough starter is not lively enough
[05:01:22] <gwern> maybe decimate it a bunch of times to speed it up through the power of the form of evolution so powerful even creationists acknowledge it exists - microevolution!
[05:01:23] <Ralith> consider a longer proof before shaping; yes, the act of shaping breaks down bubbles, but it also homogenizes the dough, and yeast gets more active over time
[05:03:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: I don't know how much livelier it can get
[05:03:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or how
[05:03:33] <Ralith> the yeast should be lively enough that a good crumb is achieved before overlarge bubbles form
[05:03:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> But sure I guess I can try longer proofs
[05:03:36] <quanticle> Wouldn't a livelier culture make the bubbling problem worse?
[05:03:58] <Ralith> you want bubbles, just homogeneous bubbles

[05:05:02] <quanticle> Okay. So what's the distinction?
[05:05:13] <Ralith> you might also mess with the temperature
[05:06:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> In what way in particular
[05:06:38] <Ralith> up to a point, yeast activity is exponentially proportional to temperature
[05:07:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm already putting the stuff in the oven to rise
[05:07:35] <Ralith> what temperature is that
[05:07:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good question I guess
[05:07:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> But whatever it is, I can't reliably go higher without applying direct heat
[05:08:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which seems unlikely to end well
[05:08:28] <Ralith> yeah it can be rough without special equipment, maybe better to focus on other axes then
[05:08:54] <Ralith> ain't no regular baker routinely lancing the bubbles on their sourdough though, is the larger point

[05:09:51] <quanticle> One thing my mom did (for yogurt, don't know how well it'll work for sourdough) is putting the bread in the oven and turning on the light

[05:10:11] <quanticle> So do we

[05:10:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Well ain't that some fancy shit :p
[05:10:31] <Ralith> I usually don't shape until there's already large gas bubbles visible from the bulk ferment

[11:02:30] <feep[work]> okay let's not dunk spiral too much here
[11:02:35] <quanticle> Fair
[11:02:48] <quanticle> Also, I haven't actually downvoted him

[11:03:40] <PapuaHardyNet> he has a positive score btw
[11:03:47] <quanticle> He does?
[11:04:14] <quanticle> Who, among us, upvoted him?
[11:04:18] <quanticle> Who was it?!
[11:04:37] <adiabatic> don't blame me, I just double-downvoted him to -1

[11:28:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I'm looking at Ghost (the Substack alternative, kinda)
[11:28:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Because someone asked me to look into it)
[11:28:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, man, they are targeting this pretty hard at "web scale"
[11:29:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> On one of their pages they're like "Ghost is totally customizable! Like if you want custom themes and stuff! All you need is a small team of developers and"
[11:31:02] <PapuaHardyNet> ghost is a substack alternative? I thought it was more of a wordpress alternative
[11:31:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's sort of both?
[11:31:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Insofar as Substack is also a Wordpress alternative
[11:31:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anything is an alternative for anything if you construe your goal broadly enough
[11:32:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway apparently Ghost uses this for themes: https://handlebarsjs.com/
[11:32:14] <Robomot> Handlebars
[11:33:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://ghost.org/docs/architecture/ :\
[11:34:00] <Robomot> Ghost Architecture ‚Äì A modern, decoupled web application for professional publishers (Ghost is structured with a robust JSON API at it's core, with a beautiful client app and a fully decoupled theme layer on the front-end ‚Äì find out more!)
[11:34:26] <PapuaHardyNet> hey obormot, I'm curious, what exactly do you work with in your day job
[11:35:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Static Site Generators
[11:35:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thanks to its decoupled architecture Ghost is also compatible with just about any of the front-end frameworks or static site generators which have become increasingly popular thanks to being fun to work with, extremely fast, and more and more powerful as the JAMstack grows in maturity. So it works with the tools you already use.
[11:35:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> This very documentation site is running on a Gatsby.js front-end, connected to both Ghost and GitHub as content sources, hosted statically on Netlify with dynamic serverless functions powered by AWS Lambda (like the feedback form at the bottom of this page). It‚Äôs a brave new world!"
[11:35:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\ :\ :\
[11:35:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: My "day job" is contract work, so I work with all sort of stuff
[11:35:51] <PapuaHardyNet> lovely, isn't it? four different ways of a website going down
[11:36:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Mostly ObjC / Swift (though not recently) / web stuff
[11:36:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, that's why you post stuff about ObjC so frequently. I assume you work on apps for Apple products (or worked on them)
[11:37:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[11:37:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have indeed
[11:37:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've moved away from that more recently though
[11:38:26] <nshepperd2> "static site generator"
[11:38:33] <saturn2> lol they even have a job ad right in the middle of the explanation of their absurdly bloated resume-oriented architecture
[11:38:39] <saturn2> nice touch
[11:38:53] <nshepperd2> /actually generates dynamic content management system using at least 6 different buzzwords like a boss
[11:40:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: You gotta admit, they are unusually up-front about it being resume-oriented
[11:40:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "increasingly popular thanks to being fun to work with"
[11:41:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, what I remember is that when Scott was moving to Substack, some people were like "no do Ghost instead, it's self-hostable so you can be super independent"
[11:42:01] <saturn2> who actually pays for all of this garbage?
[11:42:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Helpfully, they have a page of "our customers" or w/e:
[11:42:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://ghost.org/customers/

[11:43:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (OpenAI is on there!)
[11:43:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't help but notice all these sites look the fucking same
[11:55:12] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get it, why are businesses attracted to bad webdev
[11:55:25] <PapuaHardyNet> (I'm assuming that at least OpenAI could do better
[11:57:00] <PapuaHardyNet> )
[11:58:05] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I thought Ghost was a Medium alternative, not a Substack alternative

[12:00:15] <quanticle> They crushed the An-225!
[12:01:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: It is a Medium alternative insofar as Medium is a Substack alternative and a Wordpress alternative ;)
[12:01:34] <quanticle> I... okay, yeah, fair enough
[12:02:04] <quanticle> But I feel like Substack is in a different category than Wordpress/Medium/Ghost, because of its built-in email newsletter and monetization features
[12:02:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ghost has that
[12:02:45] <quanticle> Huh
[12:02:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[12:02:54] <quanticle> Okay TIL
[12:03:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, it has the email newsletter, anyway
[12:03:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm still not 100% sure what the monetization story is exactly
[12:03:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But
[12:03:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here is a useful page

[12:10:16] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: THe full answer is "hosted, unless you've got one of them 'small teams of developers' they talk about, in which case you're probably rich enough to invest in self-hosting this nonsense"
[12:10:36] <quanticle> This is literally looking at the architecture that powers Amazon or Google and deciding that it's appropriate for your little corporate blog. The non-tech analogy would be like looking at the wiring for a nuclear power station, and thinking, "Yeah, I'll wire up my two bedroom townhouse like that."
[12:11:12] <Obormot\Gaia> Yeah it's pretty crazy and I don't understand why anyone would pitch anything like this to, like... Some Blogger Dude
[12:12:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I also enjoy how their recommended setup for self-hosting it is ... not just Ubuntu specifically, but: Ubuntu, specifically, *with systemd*)
[12:12:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Why does a blog software care about something like that???)
[12:12:27] <quanticle> I'm reading this developer documentation and thinking, "I could probably write a custom content management system from scratch, using something like Django, before I could figure out how to deploy and maintain Ghost."
[12:12:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right???
[12:13:18] <PapuaHardyNet> this is *exactly* how I feel with so many applications and frameworks
[12:14:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, seriously though, why do they want you to have systemd
[12:14:13] <quanticle> Like, this is for blogposts, right? At least Wordpress has the "excuse" that people use it for so many things that lie outside its original problem domain (like e-commerce). Does Ghost support, for example, building out a full e-commerce site, with user accounts, shopping carts, etc?
[12:14:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is bothering me
[12:14:15] <PapuaHardyNet> all that effort in learning to use... say, Svelte + React + TypeScript + Electron would have been better put to learning to deploy things using more servir side scripting and JS
[12:14:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah it's for blogposts
[12:14:29] <quanticle> And only blogposts, nothing else
[12:14:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: They *explicitly* say that if you want e-commerce or that sort of thing, you should go with Wordpress instead
[12:14:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Straight up they tell you this
[12:15:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ghost is best suited for people who want to build a business around publishing. The platform comes with everything you need to publish content, including a familiar editor, built-in SEO functionality, sensible content management and flexible themes. This is why thousands of businesses choose Ghost to tell their story."
[12:15:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> ALso lol @ this:
[12:15:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Why isn‚Äôt Ghost free? I want a free platform
[12:15:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> All companies have to find some way to stay in business, so if a product is free then often that means your private data is being sold and shared with advertisers and investors. If you‚Äôre just making a small blog to write on a couple of times a year and don‚Äôt care about issues like this, then Medium is easy to get started with.
[12:15:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand if you have plans for a more serious publication, that‚Äôs where Ghost really shines. You control everything, and have security that the platform you rely on isn‚Äôt going to disappear in the next few years."
[12:16:02] <saturn2> the point isn't to have a blog that can be quickly and easily deployed and managed. the point is to live a life of leisure off of the river of free VC money with blog software as a fig leaf
[12:16:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't help but notice they *don't* say "oh but it IS free, just self-host it"
[12:16:52] <quanticle> Bahaha
[12:17:05] <quanticle> So wait, why shouldn't the business go with Wordpress for everything?
[12:18:05] <quanticle> It's easier to set up, much easier to get support for (you can find so many small businesses and contractors who'll do custom wordpress work), and it supports blogposts and much else besides.
[12:19:46] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: i assume they require systemd because of the otherwise unmanageable number of microservices that have to stay running
[12:20:02] <quanticle> saturn2: Right, but even there... imagine coming in to your regularly scheduled meeting with your VC backers, and having, "We set up a corporate blog. It only took 8 developers, 2 devops, and six weeks," as a major agenda item.
[12:20:40] <saturn2> no! forget about that! the actual blog is not impprtant
[12:21:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think saturn2 means, a life of leisure for the Ghost devs
[12:22:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or I dunno
[12:22:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: It's based on node ... does node require a ton of processes??
[12:22:30] <saturn2> what's important is delivering value by telling a story and resonating emotionally with uh idk you get the idea
[12:22:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[12:23:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ghost is focused on professional publishing, and is deeply customisable for professional use by a small team of developers."
[12:23:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ghost is best suited for people who want to build a business around publishing. The platform comes with everything you need to publish content, including a familiar editor, built-in SEO functionality, sensible content management and flexible themes. This is why thousands of businesses choose Ghost to tell their story."
[12:23:26] <quanticle> saturn2: Okay, fair enough. I see. And if you can point to a six figure investment in delivering value by telling a story and resonating emotionally, or whatever, then so much the better. And the actual developers and devops people don't complain because they can write about all these cool AWS buzzwords on their resume.
[12:23:29] <quanticle> It's the perfect crime.
[12:23:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can someone help me understand how you're supposed to monetize your ghostblog
[12:23:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's the model here
[12:23:52] <saturn2> yep. now you're thinking with funding
[12:24:26] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: check it out https://ghost.org/resources/pricing-subscription-newsletter/
[12:24:26] <Robomot> How to price your subscription newsletter (Most newsletters are priced too low because creators ask the wrong questions. Here are four questions to help you build a sustainable publishing business.)
[12:24:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I want secure, protected members-only content
[12:24:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ghost provides 100% secure server-side content gating for members-only content, allowing you to publish to a limited audience. It is not possible to achieve this from most other platforms like Squarespace, Wix, Memberstack, SentryLogin, Piano and others ‚Äî which are insecure and easily bypassed.
[12:24:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you want secure, member-based publishing where you have full control and ownership of both your content and the platform itself, Ghost is a good choice."
[12:25:44] <quanticle> But as far as I know, Ghost doesn't actually help you, the author, with any of the actual mechanics of handling subscriptions or memberships. You still have to do all that, with something like Patreon, right?
[12:26:01] <quanticle> At least Substack does all that financial stuff for you
[12:26:23] <quanticle> And handles keeping track of who paid, and therefore has access to the members-only posts.
[12:26:23] <saturn2> ghost the company does that for you, i think
[12:26:28] <quanticle> Oh
[12:26:35] <saturn2> but not ghost the software
[12:26:40] <feep[work]> guessing, the idea is that substack is paid content for non-professionals
[12:26:52] <feep[work]> or like, non-"paid content"-professionals
[12:27:10] <feep[work]> whereas with ghost it's assumed that you already know the sort of thing you want and how to set it up, you just don't want to go through the hassle?
[12:27:32] <feep[work]> it's like, "paid publishing for people with opinions on it" vs "paid publishing for people without opinions on it"
[12:27:32] <quanticle> I'll be honest, from what I'm reading thus far, my mental model for how Ghost blogs are monetized is rounding down to "SEO spam"
[12:29:04] <feep[work]> quanticle: also in case this is not common knowledge, the industry joke about wordpress is that it's a remote shell interface with a blog engine attached
[12:29:13] <feep[work]> there have been "some" big-profile security issues :p
[12:30:12] <saturn2> quanticle: it seems like it's more focused on, for lack of a better description, being a grifter
[12:30:18] <quanticle> feep[work]: Oh, I'm *well* aware of that. I'm also well aware that, at this point, it's like Windows: keep it patched and you'll be fine, and if you can't keep it patched yourself, there are quite a large number of companies who you can pay to keep your Wordpress patched for you.
[12:30:28] <feep[work]> mhguess
[12:30:41] <quanticle> As opposed to Ghost, which is only sold by Ghost (the company)
[12:32:38] <saturn2> ghost is probably a lot more secure than wordpress, i'll give em that
[12:33:52] <nshepperd2> naturally everyone runs wordpress in a VM which is reset every day at midnight
[12:34:25] <quanticle> Yeah, but on the flip side, if your fly-by-night Wordpress host goes out of business, you can back up your stuff, and find yet another fly-by-night Wordpress host to run your web site. If Ghost goes out of business, you're... just fucked, I guess.
[12:35:13] <saturn2> just install it yourself on ubuntu with systemd :)
[12:35:25] <quanticle> Even if you have exported your stuff, it's not likely to be in a format which is easily importable into some other content management system.
[12:35:27] <quanticle> Lol
[12:36:27] <PapuaHardyNet> so I'm filling out this PhD application, and in it, they ask for references. The impressive thing is that they simply ask for contact details, and say that they'll contact these people later on in the application process if you pass their initial filter
[12:36:50] <quanticle> Why is that impressive?
[12:37:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, that's so sensible! Contrast that with, say, Microsoft Research where you can't submit the application unless your reference has replied to the MSR email with the relevant details
[12:38:00] <PapuaHardyNet> It's worse when you get rejected and your professor asks you hopefully if they accepted you. That's on top of you burning some social capital by asking them to do the reference thing
[12:39:13] <PapuaHardyNet> (it is a good thing I invested in two different professors, because the first was so unreliable I entirely gave up on him recommending me to his connections.)
[12:40:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah this "how to price" page does read a lot like "how to grift", doesn't it

[12:49:28] <quanticle> "Cannot be acquired" probably
[12:50:03] <feep[work]> oyeah tbf a nonprofit being open source is a bit silly phrasing
[12:50:24] <quanticle> Yeah, it's about as accurate as saying that Red Hat cannot be acquired because it's open source

[12:54:56] <PapuaHardyNet> nooooo come on! there are people whose self-awareness is about as low as the mariana trench
[12:55:04] <feep[work]> right but ... that#
[12:55:13] <feep[work]> 's a different problem from being full cynical marketing whore
[12:55:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno guys
[12:55:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I feel like they're just lying
[12:55:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> This shit ain't "friendly, accessible, and straightforward to manage"
[12:55:44] <feep[work]> idk, it sounds very rationalists circa 2010
[12:55:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Much less "as possible"
[12:56:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody is running their own this stuff and they damn well know it
[12:56:32] <feep[work]> alternately, very internet atheism
[12:56:51] <feep[work]> they're one tuft of neckbeard away from being enlightened by their own intelligence
[12:57:07] <feep[work]> -- which, again, is where we were 14 years ish ago
[12:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The idea for the Ghost platform was first written about at the start of November 2012, in a blog post by project founder John O'Nolan,[4] the former deputy lead for the WordPress User Interface team,[5] after becoming frustrated with the complexity of using WordPress as a blog rather than a content management system."
[12:57:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just gonna say
[12:57:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have personally set up a wordpress and used it as a blog
[12:57:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was 1000x easier than this shit they describe
[12:57:58] <feep[work]> obormot I'm not saying they're *good* at their job.
[12:58:16] <feep[work]> I'm saying this isn't *necessarily* entirely a cynical cash grab
[12:58:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The idea that
[12:58:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Running a wordpress blog is too hard
[12:58:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you're gonna do a ghost instead
[12:58:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is *in-fucking-sane*
[12:58:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is completely bonkers
[12:58:45] <feep[work]> that admittedly sounds ludicrous
[12:59:07] <saturn2> they are allergic to nonsense, so they have safely ensconced all of their nonsense on a web site where they never have to look at it
[12:59:11] <feep[work]> is it too ludicrous to be an organically held position?
[12:59:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Following considerable demand and positive feedback from the community[6][7][8] on the initial blog post, O'Nolan recruited long-time friend Hannah Wolfe to help him create an initial prototype of the platform. "
[12:59:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok
[12:59:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> That there is an HN link
[12:59:28] <PapuaHardyNet> imagine going from a WP UI team to founding Ghost, a dynamic CMS that uses a static site generator
[12:59:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm gonna read it.

[13:00:22] <saturn2> i think there was a ghost version 1 that was actually pretty simple
[13:00:25] <nshepperd2> they are practically ensconced in the folds of their personal mythology
[13:01:44] <synthmeat> "ensconced in the folds of their personal mythology" that's beautiful
[13:01:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ahh HN
[13:02:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> *Of course* there's an argument in the comments about whether nobody can learn Markdown or whether Markdown is awesome

[13:02:33] <PapuaHardyNet> money is the root of all javascript
[13:03:07] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: From what I understand, *at one point* Ghost was easier and simpler than Wordpress. But it's like Firefox, you know. It started out as a simplification of Netscape, but at this point Firefox is far more complex and convoluted than Netscape ever was, while still offering less actual functionality.
[13:03:49] <quanticle> Ghost started off as a simplification of Wordpress, but at this point Ghost is more complex and convoluted than Wordpress ever was, while still offering less functionality.
[13:03:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Yeah. Firefox doesn't even have that amazing animated N button with the shooting stars
[13:03:52] <capisce> so instead of one monster you have two monsters
[13:03:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I always loved that thing
[13:04:16] <quanticle> Much less the mail client.
[13:04:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[13:05:23] <quanticle> Remember when Zawinsky's law was a thing? That "including an e-mail client" was supposed to be some kind of end state that all software would evolve towards?
[13:05:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "On April 29, 2013 ‚Äì O'Nolan released a video of the prototype in a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter with a goal of ¬£25,000 to fund the completion of initial development work.[9] The project was successfully funded in 11 hours[10] and went on to raise a final total of ¬£196,362 during the 29-day campaign.[11][12] The project relied on backing both from individuals as well as sponsorship from companies who had an
[13:05:36] <Obormot\Arcturus>  interest in seeing the platform succeed. Notable backers included Seth Godin, Leo Babauta, Darren Rowse, Tucker Max, major companies such as Woo-Themes, Envato, and Microsoft.[13]" ... it's like... the guy had SV connections? Is that the takeaway here?
[13:05:47] <quanticle> Whereas now we have software that continually gets more complex... and can't even read e-mail!
[13:06:08] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, it is absolutely crazy that Thunderbird is a *Firefox fork*
[13:06:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would so many people back a "just a basic bare-bones blogging platform" project?
[13:06:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Microsoft??
[13:06:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is this
[13:06:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, I don't believe this "it was simple at first" business at all, guys
[13:06:31] <feep[work]> looking at the blogpost
[13:06:35] <feep[work]> it smells very designer-centric?
[13:06:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> This shift was clearly grift-oriented from the start!
[13:06:49] <quanticle> >Tucker Max
[13:06:51] <quanticle> Yep
[13:06:55] <quanticle> Definitely grift oriented
[13:07:26] <quanticle> Tucker Max is like... if not the absolute king of the grifters, at least a high ranking noble
[13:07:27] <feep[work]> meh, I don't know.
[13:07:45] <quanticle> I think the king of the grifters is that Four-Hour Workweek guy

[13:08:02] <quanticle> Tim Ferriss
[13:08:04] <synthmeat> yes
[13:08:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or like this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Rowse
[13:08:33] <Robomot> Darren Rowse - Wikipedia (Darren Rowse (known online as Problogger; born 27 April 1972) is an Australian blogger, speaker, consultant and founder of several blogs and blog networks, including ProBlogger.net and digital-photography-school.com. He lives in Melbourne, Australia.[1])

[13:08:50] <quanticle> synthmeat: Dare I ask?
[13:09:09] <synthmeat> iirc he had a lifehack for that as well
[13:09:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do not tell me this was intended and designed as a simple personal blog platform from the start! Not with backing from fuckers like this! And fucking... *Microsoft*, come on
[13:09:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole "a simpler wordpress" was *obviously* fig-leaf bullshit
[13:10:34] <quanticle> You know, that's actually what I still don't understand. Tucker Max, Seth Godin, all these other random bloggers and "consultants" and "influencers", okay, I get. There's a clear theme there. People doing lifehacks and trying to monetize their "content". But what is Microsoft doing in the milieu?
[13:10:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was Kickstarter funded to the tune of $25k in 11 hours! And then raised 8x more in total!
[13:11:06] <feep[work]> my standard theory is still "there's an underfunded market for designer-centric products"
[13:11:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "On May 3, 2020, Ghost confirmed that its Ghost(Pro) platform was infected with crypto-mining malware. The virus affected both Ghost(Pro) servers and Ghost.org billing services. No user data was compromised, and user credentials were not stored in plain text.[24]" ... ahaha
[13:11:33] <synthmeat> monetizing wp hate is what it is
[13:11:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: I really do not think that's it.
[13:11:57] <synthmeat> wp and medium hate
[13:12:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "designer-centric" seems closer but also not quite right
[13:12:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> More like
[13:12:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "enabling-designers-to-diversify-grift-centric"
[13:12:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Something like that
[13:12:41] <quanticle> Oh, there is, for sure. The problem is that it's really difficult to tell the difference between designers and grifters (which, to be fair, is because being good at the shallow sort of design that looks good in a presentation has a huge overlap with being good at grifting), so any product that tries to be designer-centric ends up being grifter-centric as well.
[13:12:53] <feep[work]> my point is that .... if we assume it's "for designers, by designers"
[13:12:55] <saturn2> lmao @ crypto-mining malware
[13:13:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: It's not
[13:13:02] <feep[work]> the ludicrous complexity is not entirely unexpected
[13:13:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not by designers ... it *might* be "for designers"
[13:13:22] <feep[work]> it just smells of "management that has no idea how to manage complexity"
[13:13:30] <feep[work]> and "accumulated over a long time"
[13:14:09] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: idk, it's the way the ghost announcement blogpost looks
[13:14:10] <saturn2> it's for people with infinite money, by people who want infinite money

According to the study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involved a blend of g, of cognitive abilities other than g, and, in some cases, of non-cognitive abilities or of ‚Ä¶)
[13:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Howard Gardner, well-known wrong person, sort of criticized the book. The criticism was facile, a bunch of stuff like ‚Äúrationality is important, but relationships are also important, so there‚Äù.
[13:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pinker‚Äôs counterargument is dubious: Gardner‚Äôs essay avoids rationality pretty carefully." ... oof
[13:48:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That there's a one-two punch to be proud of
[13:49:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think Howard Gardner sort of believes [the "Rationality As Full Computation Opposed To Heuristics" view]. He has an inane paragraph about how respect is more important than rationality. When I try to make sense of it, I get an argument kind of like: the Communists trusted their reason, reasoned their way into believing Communism was true, and oppressed people because their version of communism said it was okay. But they
[13:49:37] <Obormot\Arcturus>  should have trusted a heuristic saying that every human being is worthy of respect instead."
[13:50:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well... but actually, yeah, reasoning your way into Communism and then oppressing people because your reasons says it's ok is ... actually very bad?
[13:50:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It's not what happened, of course, but)
[13:51:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "One of the most common arguments against rationality is ‚Äúsomething something white males‚Äù. I have never been able to entirely make sense of it, but I imagine if you gave the people who say it 50 extra IQ points, they might rephrase it to something like ‚Äúbecause white males have a lot of power, it‚Äôs easy for them to put their finger on the scales when people are trying to do complicated explicit computations; we would
[13:51:49] <Obormot\Arcturus>  probably do a better job building a just world if policy-makers retreated to a heuristic of ‚Äòchoose whichever policy favors black women the most.‚Äô‚Äù"
[13:52:02] * Obormot\Arcturus mutters something about "manipulation of procedural outcomes"
[13:53:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think everybody follows some combination strategy of mostly depending on heuristics, but using explicit computation to decide what heuristics to have, or what to do when heuristics conflict, or whether a certain heuristic should apply in some novel situation." ... oh Scott :\
[13:54:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Intuition can be trained. Good doctors have great intuition, and are constantly saying things like ‚Äúthis feels infectious to me‚Äù. If you ask them to explain, they‚Äôll give you fifteen different reasons it seems infectious, but also admit there are ten different reasons it might be iatrogenic and forty reasons it might be autoimmune, but the infectious reasons seem more compelling to them. A newbie intern might be able to
[13:54:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  generate the same list of 15 vs. 10 vs. 40 reasons and be totally paralyzed by indecision about which ones are most important." ... and surely we've measured the accuracy of doctors' intuitions, and found that it strongly outperforms things like simple linear models applied by dumb computer programs... oh wait, no. The opposite of that
[13:56:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "So in another conception of the debate, the Pinkerian rationalists want to explicitly compute everything through formal arguments or equations, but the Gardnerian anti-rationalists just want to get a gestalt impression and make an intuitive decision. This maps onto stereotypes about atheism vs. religion: the atheist saying ‚Äúhere are 7,000 Biblical contradictions, QED‚Äù vs. the believer saying ‚Äúbut it just feels true to
[13:56:10] <Obormot\Arcturus>  me‚Äù." ... how many believers has Scott met
[13:56:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because let me tell you, they do *not* say "but it just feels true to me"
[13:56:26] <feep[work]> eh
[13:56:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> They say stuff that is *so much dumber*
[13:56:37] <feep[work]> note that believers we tend to meet are a different sort of breed
[13:56:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> You cannot even imagine the egregiously idiotic shit that believers say to defend their belief
[13:56:50] <feep[work]> the believers I've met that are randomly sampled, ie. my parents, 100% proceed on the basis of feel.
[13:57:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Forgive me for stereotyping, but believers you've met, i.e. your parents, are *probably* fairly lukewarm in their "belief"
[13:57:22] <feep[work]> true, granted

[13:57:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've met a whole lot more true believers than you have, I promise you
[13:58:03] <feep[work]> but it seems like the arguments should demand it?
[13:58:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a whole other thing
[13:58:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which has been covered elsewhere extensively so I will not even go down this road
[13:58:35] <feep[work]> right, but the intuitive conclusion is "people follow their social adaptations over their explicit beliefs"
[13:59:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Irrelevant *and* a false dichotomy
[13:59:26] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: um, let me ask it differently
[13:59:43] <feep[work]> how many believers you've met, even as they say stupid things, actually *act like they believe* the stupid things, in nontrivial ways?

[14:00:34] <quanticle> People who do *costly* dumb things because they prayed on it, and God told them to
[14:00:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: You live in a relatively small bubble where belief is just kind of a private thing that nobody feels too strongly about

[14:11:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It wasn't all boring shit!
[14:11:49] <cyberjunkie> Amazing. I live in a world where all kinds of delusional bs is to be respected. I am acclimatized to that kind of conversation.
[14:11:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> But to be fair, my favorite depictions of Jesus are, ahem, slightly non-canonical, admittedly
[14:12:55] <quanticle> Actually, technically, Jesus wasn't lynched, was he? Lynchings are extrajudicial killings, whereas I'm under the (possibly mistaken) impression that Jesus was tried.
[14:13:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> He was indeed
[14:13:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> He fought the law and the law won
[14:13:35] <cyberjunkie> The more important question to ask people is where Jesus went after he was resurrected? 
[14:14:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> cyberjunkie: On a trip through the multiverse
[14:14:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously
[14:14:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "You can‚Äôt find the best economist by asking Keynes, Hayek, and Marx to all found companies and see which makes the most profit - that‚Äôs confusing money-making with the study of money-making." ... ask each of them to found a philosophy and see which one lets people gain the most power
[14:15:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Result: Marx beats everyone hands down, gg
[14:15:35] <cyberjunkie> Who confirmed Mary's claims of her virginity?
[14:15:54] <cyberjunkie> I'm confronted with loud hissing when I ask the Christians
[14:15:56] <quanticle> Does he? Yes, Marx lets you gain power in a local sense (both spatially and temporally), but arguably, if you want true *global*, *long-lasting* power, you've got to go with Hayek!
[14:16:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh good lord, the ACX comments to that post are full of people earnestly competing to give their personal verbal definition of rationality
[14:16:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why do I even bother
[14:17:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Scott's comment section has gone to absolute shit
[14:17:56] <quanticle> Has it gone more to shit than what it was when he had SlateStarCodex?
[14:18:13] <quanticle> Because, let's be real, even the SSC comment threads weren't exactly paragon of good sense.
[14:18:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, it's way more normie now and there's almost no continuity with the LW-sphere
[14:18:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> People posting this shit as if the Sequences don't exist
[14:19:08] <quanticle> Oh dear
[14:19:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It really is bad :(
[14:19:29] <quanticle> I guess all the cool left-wing SSC posters migrated to Reddit and the cool right-wing SSC posters migrated to DataSecretsLox.
[14:19:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[14:19:57] <quanticle> And what you have left on ACX are the MOPs and the people who were so stultifyingly normie, they may as well be classified as such
[14:20:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And new ones)
[14:20:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Who are even more so)
[14:21:14] <quanticle> Yeah, that's what I meant by MOPs. The new ones.
[14:23:01] <cyberjunkie> How many of you folk are anti-social in nature?
[14:23:41] <quanticle> "The industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race"
[14:27:09] <saturn2> scott preaching to the normies wouldn't be so bad in itself, but is he actually leaving them better than he found them?
[14:28:52] <quanticle> Scott might be the first preacher who gets converted by the crowd that he's preaching to
[14:29:30] <saturn2> :(
[14:43:32] <feep[work]> I thought the microaddictions post was neat~
[14:49:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> cyberjunkie: How did you find this channel, out of curiosity
[14:49:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Oh god, I hated that post
[14:50:11] <feep[work]> why?
[14:50:22] <quanticle> It's the Mac Micro: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/honey-i-shrunk-the-mac-enthusiast-makes-the-mac-mini-more-mini/
[14:50:23] <Robomot> Honey, I shrunk the Mac: Enthusiast makes the Mac mini more mini | Ars Technica (Mac mini mod trims the fat for a reduced footprint.)
[14:50:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: That's a rant I'd rather not start at like 6 in the AM
[14:50:39] <feep[work]> fair fair
[14:50:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: You am go to far!!
[14:51:44] <quanticle> "Snazzy Labs rebuilt the Mac mini to use an external power brick, enabling an even greater reduction of the chassis' footprint. The new power supply is really a 65 W Microsoft Surface power adapter combined with an Apple MagSafe 2 board from a 2015 MacBook Pro. The board can support up to 87 W and ends in a MagSafe 2 connector."
[14:51:46] <quanticle> Okay, never mind, I lied.
[14:51:48] <quanticle> They didn't make a Mac Micro, they moved the power adapter out of the case, and that allowed them to shrink the case.
[14:51:52] <cyberjunkie> Obormot\Arcturus: I read the site when it shows up on Hacker News once in a month. I've actually been idling here for a very long time.

[14:52:31] <cyberjunkie> I'm one of those guys in their late 30s, who's been hanging around on irc since the 90s. 
[14:52:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Yeah uh this is surprisingly unimpressive
[14:52:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> cyberjunkie: That's like at least half of us here lol
[14:52:47] <cyberjunkie> I've faced enough rubbish from the religious folk in my personal life.
[14:52:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> My condolences

[14:55:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol nailed it
[14:55:31] <cyberjunkie> Yep, my English gave it away too.
[14:55:52] <cyberjunkie> Obormot\Arcturus: where are you from?
[14:55:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> mmm no I don't think so
[14:56:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wouldn't have noticed any linguistic peculiarities, anyhow

[14:58:16] <feep[work]> programming
[14:58:17] <feep[work]> lol
[14:58:24] <cyberjunkie> feep[work]: Whaaa!
[14:59:02] <feep[work]> not entirely why, something about tendency to systematize
[14:59:03] <cyberjunkie> I would've guessed, media, content, advertising
[14:59:05] <feep[work]> sure*
[14:59:11] * feep[work] clutches chest
[14:59:25] <feep[work]> augh, what a strike
[14:59:34] <feep[work]> wwwwhy would you guess that
[14:59:43] <feep[work]> who is responsible for this impression, tell us so we can shun them
[15:00:04] <cyberjunkie> Uhhhh... 
[15:00:06] * cyberjunkie ducks
[15:00:08] <feep[work]> XD
[15:00:13] <feep[work]> is all good
[15:00:40] <cyberjunkie> I also must say, of the 20-odd channels I idle on, this is quite possibly the noisiest. 
[15:00:43] <feep[work]> but yeah the lw readership is almost memetically composed with programmer people
[15:00:46] <feep[work]> of*

[15:01:13] <feep[work]> interestingly this was the case even before lesswrong existed
[15:01:22] <cyberjunkie> I come from a tech-writing background, but primarily someone who fidgets with things, I also have learned some Python since the Covid lockdowns.
[15:01:33] <feep[work]> yay
[15:02:05] <quanticle> Whoa you're a tech writer?
[15:02:14] <feep[work]> <quanticle> can you write me a tech
[15:02:17] <quanticle> Those... still exist?
[15:02:19] <cyberjunkie> Well, I used to, and I still do for the company I work with.
[15:02:28] <quanticle> I feel like I'm talking to a coelocanth
[15:02:33] <cyberjunkie> I left the media space back in 2011
[15:02:50] <quanticle> Oh, tech writer as in like writing about tech?
[15:03:08] <quanticle> Or tech writer as in writing product manuals and such?
[15:03:15] <cyberjunkie> Yea, yea, those technology reviewers, where we actually ran benchmarks and logged scores, compared them, then wrote an article
[15:03:19] <quanticle> Ah
[15:03:40] <cyberjunkie> Now, everyone just says this product looks nice, and is cool.
[15:04:26] <quanticle> Okay, I was thinking the latter, and I was like, "I'm pretty sure all technical writers spontaneously went extinct around 2004" and now the only product manuals you get are either diagrams or English that's been clearly Google translated from Mandarin
[15:04:55] <feep[work]> mr phoronix still exists
[15:04:58] <cyberjunkie> haha
[15:06:08] <quanticle> Yeah, AnandTech still does benchmarks too
[15:06:25] <feep[work]> arstech too I think, not sure
[15:06:29] <quanticle> Though we'll see how long that goes given that both Anand Shilpi and Ian Cutress have left
[15:07:21] <quanticle> feep[work]: Ars Technica still has actual reviews, but unfortunately every time I visit that site, there are more editorial pieces (most of which are syndicated from Wired or somewhere else)
[15:07:41] <feep[work]> mmhm

[15:09:18] <quanticle> Took that at MicroCenter a little while ago
[15:09:59] <quanticle> Just... a commentary on the state of the world, where even PC enthusiast magazines are like, "Okay, it's a given that you're not going to be able to get a GPU, so let's see how far you can go on integrated graphics!"
[15:11:10] <cyberjunkie> quanticle: woahhh
[15:11:12] <quanticle> It just reminded me of some of those magazine articles you'd see from like World War 2, which would advise homemakers on how to cook without rationed ingredients
[15:11:34] <cyberjunkie> I wrote an article about the NVIDIA nForce when it was launched.
[15:11:45] <cyberjunkie> and how it whopped Intel's arse, when the i810 and i815 were around
[15:12:10] <galambo> I liked hardocp. they would try to figure out the best settings to run the games on

[15:25:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I will not tolerate this brain die size stagnation

[15:25:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> '... wow
[15:25:51] <quanticle> But it's not as dumb as books actually getting pulled from library shelves
[15:26:12] <quanticle> I wonder if Oprah understands that War and Peace is actually rather anti-war
[15:26:42] <quanticle> And also I don't care what they do to Tolstoy as long as they keep Dostoyevsky 
[15:27:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Chekhov > Dostoyevsky > Tolstoy imo
[15:27:14] <nshepperd2> oh no, not oprahs book club
[15:27:24] <capisce> maybe he should have called it "Peace, not War"
[15:29:52] <quanticle> Speaking of which, there's apparently a joke going around in Russia that Putin has ordered "War and Peace" to be renamed to "Special Operations and Peace"
[15:30:25] <gurkenglas> Can you recommend a place where I can get a graph plotting each country's covid case counts on a log scale? I want to see the extent to which the BA.2 lineage makes the curve go up once it's alone.

[15:33:43] <quanticle> It's what I've done in the past when I've had to provide long test cases
[15:34:13] <PapuaHardyNet> just started using pytest yesterday btw. I never knew how useful a testing framework is until I had it
[15:34:51] <PapuaHardyNet> and that is even *after* I wrote an SRS application using golang with unit tests. Clearly I have problems with evaluating what programming language features I need but don't have
[15:35:11] <quanticle> Wait, they support DOCX? Okay, I take back my advice. What you need to do, is print out your test script, put it on a wooden table, photograph it, paste the pictures into a word doc and attach it to the ticket
[15:35:11] <feep[work]> builtin unittests ftw
[15:35:33] <PapuaHardyNet> good god, what are you doing quant
[15:36:10] <quanticle> Ensuring nshepperd2 gets the highest quality tech support
[15:37:47] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: hypothesis.readthedocs.io
[15:37:48] <Robomot> Welcome to Hypothesis! ‚Äî Hypothesis 6.39.1 documentation
[15:39:26] <PapuaHardyNet> this looks good, I'll give it a try thank you
[15:40:07] <quanticle> I haven't used Hypothesis, and I'm mostly agnostic on Pytest vs. unittest
[15:40:43] <quanticle> Pytest is nicer, I'll admit, but I'm still not sure whether it's nicer enough to justify including an additional dependency
[15:41:37] <quanticle> The main thing that pytest avoids is you having to create classes that inherit from unittest.testcase. And instead of writing unittest.assert, you can just use the normal assert statement.
[15:42:00] <quanticle> But... I dunno, that doesn't seem like that big of a dea

[16:50:35] <PapuaHardyNet> "Overall, Grenoble as a city is the largest research center in France after Paris with 22,800 researchers. In April 2019, UGA is selected to host one of the four French institutes in artificial intelligence." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble_Alpes_University
[16:50:36] <Robomot> Grenoble Alpes University - Wikipedia (The Universit√© Grenoble Alpes (UGA, French: meaning "Grenoble Alps University") is a public research university in Grenoble, France. Founded in 1339, it is the third largest university in France with about 60,000 students and over 3,000 researchers[3])
[16:52:38] <PapuaHardyNet> Grenoble is clearly a ridiculously densely clustered city consisting of researchers - I believe that it *may* be the cause of France being the biggest source of NIPS and ICML published researchers

[18:27:05] <adiabatic> depends on the client. I set all my clients to pick three preferred nicknames; others just try again with a trailing underscore if the preferred nickname is in use
[18:27:39] <PapuaHardyNet> adiabatic, adiabatoc, and adiabatty, I guess
[18:28:27] <adiabatic> Two out of three right. Generally, you won't see my Plan C name, especially since my favorite client hasn't been ported to Apple Silicon.

[23:52:31] <two2thehead> 'How often do people intend to engage in interpersonal emotion regulation in day-to-day life? Existing literature has focused primarily on asking about the strategies people use to regulate, which means researchers have little understanding of how often people actually aim to engage in regulation to begin with. To answer this foundational question, we conducted two studies using daily diary (N = 171) and experience sampling methods (N = 239). We 
[23:52:31] <two2thehead> explored how often people use others to regulate their own emotions, and how often they regulate others‚Äô emotions. Almost everyone engaged in interpersonal emotion regulation at least once over the course of a week, primarily with the goal to help themselves or others feel better, rather than worse. In fact, people regulated others‚Äô emotions nearly twice as often as they turned to others to regulate their own emotions, and put more consci
[23:52:31] <two2thehead> ous effort into regulating others‚Äô emotions compared to their own. Trait perceived efficacy of engaging in interpersonal emotion regulation was the most consistent predictor of momentary regulation intentions. The medium of the interaction‚Äîin person or digital‚Äîdid not consistently predict momentary intentions or effort. Together, these findings provide a foundational picture of the interpersonal emotion regulation landscape, and la
[23:52:38] <two2thehead> y the groundwork for future exploration into this emerging subfield of affective science.'
[23:54:39] <two2thehead> 'Trait perceived efficacy of engaging in interpersonal emotion regulation was the most consistent predictor of momentary regulation intentions.'
[23:54:40] <two2thehead> Hypothesis; There are people out there who are consistently better-than-average at inducing emotional regulation in others. If they were to be a)found and b)correctly coordinated such that they are used to decrease emotional disorder in others, the median mood of the group would be improved and measurably so.
