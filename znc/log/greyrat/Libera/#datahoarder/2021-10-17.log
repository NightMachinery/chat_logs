[01:02:50] <joepie91> JTL: https://woonopstand.nl/
[01:03:04] <joepie91> will have to get up early, am volunteering for buildup
[01:03:36] <JTL> ah
[01:03:39] <JTL> good luck
[01:04:00] <joepie91> TL:DR housing market fucked, series of major protests ongoing, actively supported by basically every leftist organization and political party from radical to established/"respectable" and a number of non-leftist organizations
[01:04:11] <joepie91> 14k people showed up to the first one, second one is tomorrow
[01:04:22] <JTL> yeah
[01:04:25] <JTL> we could use that here
[01:04:31] <joepie91> and the demands made are decidedly on the radical side compared to typical Dutch standards
[01:04:32] <JTL> instead we get inaction and "useful idiots"
[01:04:40] <joepie91> and they are very explicitly demands
[01:04:44] <JTL> yeah
[01:05:01] <joepie91> the organizers are very strategically competent, and have made it clear that they aren't open to compromise, and that things will 'escalate' if the demands are not met
[01:05:10] <JTL> ah
[01:05:16] <JTL> what leverage do they have?
[01:05:17] <joepie91> so this is gon' be interesting

[01:07:16] <joepie91> the organizers have approached this very well - they've very publicly refused to accept 'debate' invitations from politicians prior to the first protest, to prevent coopting
[01:07:16] <JTL> here, things are a bit "in the middle" compared to there, and "carry on lol"
[01:07:18] <JTL> :|
[01:07:30] <ThePendulum> what is the next step of just as many protestors from the opposition show up and cause a similar racket?
[01:07:33] <JTL> smart
[01:07:52] <joepie91> they met up with the housing minister after the first protest, and afterwards very publicly stated "we do not believe they are serious, we will not compromise, and if our demands are not met then things will escalate"
[01:07:53] <joepie91> in other words...
[01:08:03] <joepie91> they are very effectively framing it as "we are the party setting demands here"
[01:08:12] <JTL> Makes sense
[01:08:30] <joepie91> ThePendulum: there's... not really any opposition besides landlords
[01:08:36] <joepie91> and uh, do you see landlords counterprotesting? :p
[01:08:47] <JTL> The mental image there is hilarious
[01:08:51] <joepie91> exactly lmao

[01:09:07] <ThePendulum> would you go as far as destroying the properties?
[01:09:09] <joepie91> this is... not a playing field that lies within their comfort zone
[01:09:23] *** Joins: Darkcoal (~user@139.64.60.27)
[01:09:37] <joepie91> ThePendulum: I would prefer it not be necessary, but I do think that it can be a legitimate tactic if other methods fail
[01:09:59] <joepie91> realistically, squatting is likely to be the first escalation
[01:10:04] <joepie91> not property destruction
[01:11:20] <joepie91> there's apparently also a new generation of squatters brewing, so
[01:11:31] <joepie91> may we live in interesting times?
[01:11:46] <ThePendulum> I guess one tactic they could use is use their money to pay people to get out there, lol, or not even pay all of them, but just one person who's good with words who can make a damning facebook post
[01:12:10] <joepie91> I'm skeptical that that'd work here
[01:12:17] <joepie91> this is not a niche issue
[01:12:48] <joepie91> the housing crisis has reached the middle class at which point it's very difficult to deny its existence
[01:12:54] <ThePendulum> don't even have to outnumber you, as with some previous protests they can just plant a few deviants to skew your cause in the eye of the media
[01:13:07] <joepie91> and keep in mind that the protesters control the narrative very strongly and effectively
[01:13:17] <joepie91> yeahhhh so, about that
[01:13:24] <ThePendulum> I do guess it's a bit more comprehensible and closer to home across the board than "the climate" or "racism"
[01:13:29] <joepie91> that strategy only works when you're trying to be respectable
[01:13:33] <joepie91> we don't :p
[01:13:51] <joepie91> like I said, the demands are quite radical for Dutch standards, it's explicitly pro squatting
[01:14:19] <ThePendulum> that's not /that/ radical over here compared to say the US is it?
[01:14:28] <ThePendulum> or maybe my local area is different from the rest of the country
[01:14:34] <joepie91> when a bunch of squatters got arrested for trying to squat a building after the first protest, and the media was all like "oh yeah they're surely unrelated to the legitimate protesters", the organizers very explicitly put out a statement going "no, fuck that, they are very much a part of this movement too, squatting is a legitimate tactic"
[01:14:46] <joepie91> in that context, good luck trying to soil the reputation of the movement
[01:15:00] <joepie91> ThePendulum: https://woonmanifest.nl/
[01:15:38] <joepie91> the demands include decriminalizing squatting, abolishing temporary rental contracts
[01:15:59] <joepie91> widespread opkoopbescherming
[01:16:00] <joepie91> etc.
[01:16:22] <joepie91> that definitely qualifies as 'radical' in the current political climate in NL
[01:17:35] <joepie91> anyhow, I think that the rejection of 'respectability' combined with the solid strategy on framing and control of the narrative, will make it very difficult to co-opt this
[01:18:58] <JTL> Interesting
[01:19:57] <ThePendulum> if squatting is an escalation, I'm trying to think why landowners and by extension policy makers would care about squatters. because I would think you have a situation in which squatters are doing just that; squatting, and basically not really bothering anyone, or they're presenting themselves as a nuiseance, in which case they're hurting their own cause
[01:21:19] <joepie91> a lot of building owners historically indeed haven't really cared about squatters, the ones that did care generally didn't have any economic or practical reason, just poorly-controlled anger and a sense of entitlement
[01:21:26] <joepie91> as for policy-makers, it gets more complex
[01:22:41] <joepie91> the VVD has historically been the driving factor behind the squatting ban, and they are very much trying to basically make a moral appeal that's in line with their general platform: "property rights" go above everything else, "van andermans spullen blijf je af" (you've probably heard that one before), and generally highly individualist views that aim to legitimate the "fuck you I got mine" that is inherent in capitalism, which is the
[01:22:41] <joepie91> VVD's *true* demographic
[01:23:37] <joepie91> it doesn't matter whether it actually does damage or not, it doesn't matter whether it's economically bad or good for building owners, the point is that it is a moral transgression of their 'values', shitty as they are, and anything other than rejecting and demonizing it would imply that it's valid for people to take collective action against individual interests
[01:24:18] <joepie91> which opens the door to rejecting the validity of the entire neoliberal (ie. capitalist) platform that the VVD (and to some degree the CDA) is built upon
[01:24:39] <joepie91> because the moment property rights aren't absolute and above everything else, a whole lot of shit in their platform suddenly doesn't make sense anymore
[01:24:53] <ThePendulum> if they're abandoned it practically and emotionally such as when it's merely an investment, I agree
[01:25:00] <ThePendulum> *'ve
[01:25:08] <joepie91> it's the lynchpin of their ideology
[01:25:22] <joepie91> linchpin?
[01:25:35] <joepie91> ThePendulum: that is generally what gets squatted, yes
[01:25:45] <joepie91> but again, that's besides the point from the VVD's perspective
[01:25:58] <joepie91> it's the practice that they must condemn, regardless of circumstances, to remain consistent with their ideological platform
[01:27:02] <joepie91> it's 100% a propaganda game, it has nothing whatsoever to do with economic (or other) harm/benefit
[01:27:57] <joepie91> keep in mind that *before* the squatting ban, it was considered essentially legal but only in buildings that had been empty for >1 year and which had no legitimate 'bestemming'
[01:28:17] <joepie91> so there were already the necessary controls in place to ensure that it didn't cause harm
[01:28:18] <ThePendulum> that's what I'm most familiar with with Landbouwbelang over here in Maastricht, I thought it was condoned to this day
[01:28:33] <joepie91> and it wasn't causing harm (despite certain newspapers' tendency to suggest otherwise)
[01:29:02] <joepie91> a couple of squats are still tolerated, yes
[01:29:08] <joepie91> the ones that have existed for a long long time
[01:29:13] <joepie91> policy also varies by city
[01:29:23] <joepie91> but in principle it's a criminal offense now, with jail time
[01:29:31] <joepie91> and evictions are very likely if you squat something new
[01:29:49] <joepie91> legally sound evictions or otherwise
[01:30:02] <ThePendulum> yeah imo that should be more like escaping from jail, you can get fined for the damage you do during it, but not for the actual escape
[01:30:03] <joepie91> anyway
[01:30:10] <joepie91> I should sleep, have to get up early
[01:30:17] <joepie91> right
[01:30:21] <joepie91> that's how it used to be
[01:30:32] <ThePendulum> I don't think you should be able to turn the place into a crack den without consequences
[01:30:33] <joepie91> before the VVD wrecked it
[01:30:43] <joepie91> "turn the place into a crack den" basically doesn't happen
[01:30:49] <joepie91> in NL anyway
[01:30:50] <ThePendulum> not as much in NL
[01:30:51] <ThePendulum> yeah
[01:31:20] <joepie91> I don't know of a single case where a building was squatted by actual squatters (ie. who lived there long-term) and it was turned into a drug den, in the time I've been alive
[01:31:36] <joepie91> far as I can tell, it just doesn't happen
[01:32:07] <joepie91> the Telegraaf loves to publish very precisely cropped photos of squats to imply that buildings have been trashed, though
[01:32:19] <ThePendulum> in the US a lot of these policies are horribly misaligned, over here we deal with drug abuse not perfectly, but significantly better than in the US
[01:33:25] <joepie91> of course in practice, either 1) they photographed one specific messy corner and the rest of the building is fine, or 2) the place was trashed by the owner (trashing toilets to prevent squatters is somewhat common), or 3) squatters were evicted without having the time to clear out the place and move their stuff and that gets knocked over and presented as 'trash left behind'
[01:34:02] <ThePendulum> there is some "no true scottsman" fallacy in that though, there are inevitably going to be imperfect squatters to deal with
[01:34:08] <ThePendulum> anyway I don't want to keep you up
[01:34:12] <joepie91> ThePendulum: probably the closest thing to a drug den squat that I know of in NL, was Anarres in Dordrecht, which originally operated (while squatted) as a concert venue
[01:34:28] <joepie91> and it was definitely messy, power was cut off, and it wasn't the most healthy place, but still definitely not just a drug den
[01:34:33] <joepie91> and in that case the owner was actually fine with it
[01:34:51] <joepie91> (complicated story, involves a land dispute between the owner and the city)
[01:35:05] <ThePendulum> hm yeah Landbouwbelang is a cultural hub with regular concerts, I don't actually remember hearing from the owners, it's mainly been the city contemplating what to do with it
[01:35:09] <joepie91> at one point it burned out and he asked the squatters to move back in to prevent it from being demolished ðŸ™ƒ
[01:35:13] <ThePendulum> heh
[01:35:33] <joepie91> <ThePendulum> there is some "no true scottsman" fallacy in that though, there are inevitably going to be imperfect squatters to deal with
[01:35:38] <joepie91> imperfect, sure. but "squatting" is a very specific thing, not just "breaking into a building"
[01:36:09] <joepie91> it's very much activist direct action and housing-related, so unless something ticks those boxes it probably isn't really squatting
[01:37:05] <joepie91> (for a somewhat broad definition of 'housing', not just residential)

[06:49:33] <evilgohan2> I imagine there are some who just didn't come over from freenode
[06:49:43] <evilgohan2> Especially since the channel used to float 500 users from what I recall
[06:49:50] <salmon> Probably
[06:49:56] <evilgohan2> But, on that same token, I notice year/year that irc participation tends to drop.
[06:50:13] <evilgohan2> like, in general
[06:50:35] <Selavi> phibs being banned did a bit to that effect as well
[06:50:52] <evilgohan2> Yeah, that nick is familiar. He was one of the worst ones imho.

[10:28:21] <evilgohan2> Got out of the torrent game back in the early 2010s. Didn't seem worth the risk w/o running a VPS with a VPN.
[10:35:55] <Selavi> no worries mate. I see. although I've never had issues with private trackers
[10:36:23] *** Quits: Haxxa (~Haxxa@103-21-0-105.ip4.superloop.com) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[10:37:13] <evilgohan2> at the time, there were a few that were breached
[10:37:53] <evilgohan2> then things got elitist
[10:38:02] <evilgohan2> I recall one tracker that was fundamentally pay-to-get-in
[10:38:16] <Selavi> ah
[10:38:17] <evilgohan2> Anyone could be invited, but no one ever got invites unless they paid $20
[10:38:24] <evilgohan2> there was the whole mess with TehConnection
[10:38:37] <evilgohan2> Oink's Pink Palace
[10:38:43] <evilgohan2> What.cd
[10:38:49] <evilgohan2> and trying to keep up with all of those
[10:38:56] <Selavi> oh yeah, those ring a bell
[10:38:57] <evilgohan2> GFT was cool, but unfortunately closed.
[10:39:01] <evilgohan2> Shame too.
[10:39:07] <evilgohan2> It was ratioless and was great.
[10:39:10] <evilgohan2> SCC was ok.
[10:39:32] <evilgohan2> RevTT was okay for a bit. Blackcats was cool for games.
[10:39:46] <evilgohan2> But trackers would come up and down, and - after a point - it just became too much of a chore to keep up with
[10:40:56] <evilgohan2> the one I really wanted, but never could get into was AnimeDVDClub
[10:41:02] <evilgohan2> AsianDVDClub *
[10:41:12] <evilgohan2> there was SO much Japanese and Chinese content there.
[10:41:29] <evilgohan2> Some of it trickled down to Usenet, and it was awesome.
[10:43:45] <evilgohan2> then that tracker died so a LOT of content went out the door with it.
[10:43:51] <Selavi> yeah, it's nice to have a reliable source for shit
