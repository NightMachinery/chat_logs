[02:04:30] <PMT> that's not very specific, but if that keeps happening, you should either point to a different mirror, or if you're using e.g. deb.debian.org, look into your internet connection and/or hardware bitflipping.

[02:06:02] <PMT> pastebinning the output you're getting that's showing an issue would be a good start.

[02:11:05] <PMT> hardware randomly flipping bits, as the word "randomly" implies, is somewhat hard to isolate to any component other than "remove/replace component, does the problem go away".
[02:11:52] <PMT> But if it's a more narrow set of conditions where it fails, it's more likely a more specific problem of some kind.

[02:25:24] <mjorgensen> Kinda sounds like I massively messed up and a reinstall is my best optino.
[02:25:32] <PMT> i'd probably try making sure apt and dpkg and {lib,}lzma are upgraded before installing more things
[02:25:46] <knotMez> mjorgensen a reinstall is always the best option
[02:25:59] <knotMez> cleanest
[02:26:34] <PMT> You can do that. I think it's overkill here, but you can.
[02:26:37] <knotMez> I'm trying to get all my CD software working again all the stuff in Debian is broken
[02:26:44] <mjorgensen> I thought it was overkill, too.
[02:26:49] <sney> debian is designed to upgrade releases cleanly, and that error from upgrading the python package is unusual
[02:26:58] <mjorgensen> but I can't remove python3.7, it throws the same broken packages error
[02:27:07] <sney> if there's an underlying hardware issue, a reinstall is unlikely to fix it
[02:27:26] <PMT> That isn't a checksum issue.
[02:27:29] <mjorgensen> this server's been running strong for about 3 years, so I don't think theres a hardware issue.
[02:27:30] <sney> that sounds like there's a problem on the disk, really. run some smart tests, or an offline vendor test
[02:27:40] <sney> everything was working until it broke
[02:27:55] <mjorgensen> until I broke it, yes.
[02:28:21] <PMT> I don't know that it's a disk problem if it repeatedly downloads the same file and errors on unpacking it. I'd guess it's somehow an incompatible compressed stream and you need to update the tooling.
[02:28:27] <PMT> But that's just a guess without more data.
[02:29:17] <PMT> I'm not sure how much I'd say it was working if you had just not updated it in over a year.
[02:29:38] <PMT> But that depends on your definition, ofc.
[02:30:34] <mjorgensen> I never said I hjadn't updated in over a year.
[02:30:50] <PMT> If it was running 10.4, 10.5 dropped on August 2020.
[02:30:50] <mjorgensen> I did say I didn't have problems upgrading packages before attempting to upgrade to 11.
[02:31:25] <mjorgensen> Hm, I didn't realize a simple apt upgrade upgrades point releases.
[02:31:49] <PMT> I would be pretty surprised if it didn't.
[02:33:19] <PMT> IIRC apt update prints a little "hey, fyi, it bumped to 10.10" when it first sees that.
[02:33:19] <somiaj> though here point releases should only have targeted bug fixes, so the upgrades should be both desired and minimial.
[02:33:30] <PMT> It's true.
[02:33:44] <somiaj> regressions do happen, but not that often to worry about not autoatically upgrading to the point release when it is availble.
[02:34:09] <somiaj> and outside of the kernel on certain hardware, I can't recally many of them.
[02:34:16] <PMT> In any case, the two things I'd suggest would be checking the versions of apt/dpkg/liblzma and upgrading them if they're old, and asking debsums if something is on fire.
[02:35:14] <mjorgensen> Alright, well apt -f install seems to have worked now, so I'm back to checksum issues

[03:22:00] <somiaj> Well even with vga=ask, xorg would just do its own thing, so it could be that xorg is where the issue is and not the kernel
[03:22:17] <somiaj> but somethings you can do, first you can just disable modesetting, 'nomodeset' as a boot option, though this isn't ideal.
[03:22:17] <Blondie101010> not right after the grub menu
[03:22:21] <PMT> i mean, there's two issues, right, there's no display post-grub pre-xorg, and there's no display in xorg.

[03:34:35] <ede> the power connector was something you just attached directly to the board. (yes, directly).
[03:35:43] <ede> and it was known to lose contact by just looking at it. which is not surprising with the connector probably being heavier that the whole... computer.
[03:36:35] <ede> i remember i changed resolution in console once because VGA text mode on a 1050p display was a bit anachronistic.

[03:39:19] <somiaj> this just disables all the kms stuff, which in general isn't what most users want.
[03:39:42] <somiaj> but it can sometimes at least get your system booting so you can help debug the actual issue of why kms isn't setting the correct resolutions for the monintors edid
[03:40:27] <ede> given the problem i have with that digital receiver it maybe really is the TV not reporting what it should on the HDMI
[03:41:59] <somiaj> If you think the issue with the edid, you can use drm.edid_firmware=edid/1024x768.bin to use a built in edid vs the monintors one. Though I don't see one for the resolution 1440x900 you want, so unsure if you can force that.

[05:01:34] <knotMez> mjorgensen perhaps you can be nicer than others can be?
[05:01:59] <mjorgensen> so I've been told. I don't think that excuses poor behavior though.
[05:02:02] <knotMez> personally I don't take things personally
[05:02:40] <mjorgensen> my point is even though I did a dumb thing, I wasn't attacked for it like I could have been in other channels.
[05:02:57] <ede> would be hard to do so on irc anyway, at least on such networks/channels where people don't know each other personally most of the times.

[06:29:39] <naptastic> eblip, so, does .bashrc currently make any changes to $PATH?
[06:29:59] <eblip> when i source it it adds new stuff
[06:30:12] <eblip> but when i comment it out ....the new stuff remains even after i source the file
[06:30:13] <naptastic> hmm... does .bashrc source any other files?
[06:30:21] <naptastic> oh well yeah, if you comment it out
[06:30:35] <eblip> hmmm...ill check
[06:31:04] <naptastic> you need to set $PATH to a value that doesn't contain the custom values, because if all the PATH lines are commented out, there's nothing that's going to set it back to the previous value.
[06:32:07] <eblip> ah ok
[06:32:26] <eblip> i know i can do that by rebooting..but wonder if there is an easier way
[06:32:36] <willow> Python shutil.which() looks ok.  The source has "if os.path.dirname(cmd): ..."
[06:34:06] <eblip> Ah think i got it naptastic...when i source .bashrc from my tmux window the path remains the same ..but when i open a complete new window it resets it proper

[14:03:03] <DHE> they can be RAID members with a bunch of caveats. last I tried (buster) the installer wouldn't set it up properly though requiring manual intervention.
[14:03:38] <Khepra> I'm not using the installer for servers, I have advanced setups of btrfs/zfs atop of luks atop of multiple drives
[14:04:32] <Khepra> at any rate, I'm interested in ESP handling post-installation. Right now I have a service that rsyncs them on shutdown, and I keep /boot on a md raid1
[14:05:10] <hassoon> RAID? heard of that before
[14:05:24] <hassoon> something related to storage drives or something..
[14:05:49] <Khepra> from what I read here and there, others seem to do the same ((r)sync multiple ESPs), but I was wondering if there's a standardized solution to what I'm guessing is becoming an ubiquitous problem on modern servers/machines with RAID, some of which don't even have legacy BIOS boots

[21:47:28] <Khepra> the way I use it is not with systemd services at all. I have ifupdown hotplug stanzas which set up when the wifi USB is plugged in. I'm sure that's not the ideal way to use it

[21:58:16] <Khepra> kee: actually, doing all this eliminates a whole lot of variables which then leaves that specific template problematic. but first you must be 100% that using wpasupplicant with that config actualyl works 100%. wifi part AND tcp/ip part.
[21:58:40] <kee> It's not even getting that far, though.
[21:58:44] <Khepra> only then you've isolated the issue ino that specific unit
[21:58:50] <kee> It times out before it runs the wpa_supplicant command.
[21:59:08] <kee> Presumably because it thinks wlan0 doesn't exist, when it does.
[21:59:19] <kee> But I don't actually know what's happening, because it's systemd.
[21:59:34] <Khepra> hold on. can you first confirm that using wpasupplicant directly, from the command line, connects you fine and you get an IP with dhclient (or via static IP), verify teh network works and routes as expected
[21:59:50] <Khepra> you can, say, ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
[22:00:14] <kee> I can't, because it's a weird network.
[22:00:21] <kee> Really, really weird.
[22:00:27] <kee> It doesn't work as expected, then randomly does.
[22:00:28] <Khepra> doing that you've verified the wlan0 iface works, that config works, tcp/ip is routed and works -- isolating the problem.
[22:00:45] <kee> Can I ping another device on the network without DHCP?
[22:00:53] <Khepra> kee: then you can't blame the systemd unit just yet. forget about it for now, until youv'e verified wifi works when used manually.
[22:01:08] <kee> I can connect to the network, though. Is that not enough?
[22:01:10] <Khepra> kee: you can't ping without some sort of defined IP address and routing

[22:02:00] <kee> TheBigK: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot looks okay?
[22:02:02] <Khepra> kee: "connect to the network" if you mean wifi network, then no it's not enough. there's multiple OSI layers involved here. wifi layer is one, the above layers are separate
[22:02:19] <kee> I don't get it.
[22:02:34] <kee> systemd can't tell whether the higher layers are working, if it's not connected to a network in the first place.
[22:02:34] <Khepra> connecting to wifi network is just like plugging in a cable made of EM fields, instad of copper and plastics
[22:02:53] <Khepra> forget systemd until you verifiy your wpasupplicant configuration is complete
[22:02:54] <kee> And it's not letting wpa_supplicant try, because it's decided that the device isn't there.
[22:03:51] <kee> The error is:
[22:03:58] <Khepra> so wifi = cable made of EM fields instead of copper and plastics.  and if you plug in the cable, you don't have the network until you set up the higher OSI levels: IP addressing and routing (which dhclient does via DHCP)

[22:11:18] <kee> That works fine.
[22:11:37] <Khepra> problem solved?
[22:11:51] <kee> I suppose?
[22:12:00] <kee> But then I'm maintaining my own custom service files.
[22:12:05] <kee> It's not actually fixing the problem.
[22:12:08] <Khepra> sure. units are _meant_ to be overriden, either whole like that, or by using drop-ins
[22:12:35] <kee> Urgh. I hate systemd.
[22:12:36] <Khepra> also don't think that default, "vendor" units are bug free and even sanely written. I know a number of debian supplied units that are utterly insane.
[22:13:01] <kee> I'm pretty sure it is correct.

[22:13:11] <kee> In theory, wpa_supplicant should be run after the device is present.
[22:13:21] <kee> It's just that systemd can't tell it exists.
[22:13:25] <Khepra> now one thing that comes to mind is ... given your other iface is not eth0 .. how come wlan0 is? what is renaming it and at what stage, and is that rename in conflict with expected .device name
[22:14:06] <Khepra> check dmesg for occurrences of "wlan0", maybe it shows a rename from something like wlx<macaddrhere>
[22:14:30] <kee> It shouldn't be wlx… because it's internal.
[22:14:45] <Khepra> doesn't matter, I just gave an example

[22:15:33] <kee> According to grep, anyway.
[22:16:02] <Khepra> are there rename mentions for "eth0" ?
[22:16:18] <kee> Yes.
[22:16:27] <Khepra> you should expect to see kernel naming it eth0 and then udev renaming to whatever rule was chosen
[22:16:31] <Khepra> okay.

[22:17:30] <Khepra> kee: you could ask in #systemd how to further debug proper naming of that .device, beacsue it's systemd specific and you won't `ls` it anywhere under /sys . that's one of those terrible designed of systemd...
[22:18:07] <Khepra> maybe something involving udevadm, I'm not really sure. but you do have an indication of something going on, if it's named wlan0 and it shouldn't've been (ie. udev should've renamed it)
[22:19:07] <Khepra> the simplest "fix" is commenting out that Require directive and see if everything works following a reboot. it's a... hack... but for some thing in systemd, such hacks are the only solution, unfortunately. for every good and useful feature, there's a monstrosity lurking in the shadows.
