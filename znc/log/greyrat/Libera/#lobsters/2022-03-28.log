[13:11:49] <river> is there something like python or bash but it just does a quick scan over the whole script first to check e.g. all the variables you use are bound
[13:12:59] <jle> you could use shellcheck to do that for you with bash
[13:13:23] <river> i wonder if i can make bash itself run shellcheck every time?

[14:31:10] <bkhl> river, flake8 is a framework for running other checkers, including pyflakes.
[14:31:18] <river> ok
[14:31:23] <river> i probably want flake8 then!
[14:31:36] <bkhl> Very likely.
[14:31:48] <bkhl> Personally I use pytest plugins for the various linters we use.
[14:32:03] <bkhl> But if you prefer to keep linting separate from other testing, then flake8 is neat.
[14:35:31] <epilys> pylint too
[14:35:48] <epilys> ah it was mentioned, sorry
[14:36:02] <bkhl> Both flake8 and pytest can run that through plugins.
[14:36:11] <bkhl> In the case of flake8, I think the plugin for it is bundled.
[14:40:35] <river> what i want really is just that every time i run my script it checks it first

[15:54:41] <bkhl> I know a lot of people don't really use the fixture functionality in pytest, instead just making them functions.
[15:55:16] <bkhl> Of course that removes two benefits, the ability to reuse the same fixture in multiple tests without rebuilding it from scratch (depending on the scope), and the ability to distinguish between "actual" test failures and failures in the setup.

[16:02:53] <ignaloidas> I honestly don't find much problems in the magic, considering that I already just search for the name of the function in the project, and fixtures don't really change that
[16:04:23] <ignaloidas> Of course for those who use editor integrations heavily this might be a downside, but integrations can be built for pytest too

[18:10:17] <epilys> it annoys me that curl and even wget I think are not part of the base debian install still
[18:10:39] <kline> i dont think thats a bad thing
[18:10:50] <kline> the debian base install being small is just fine
[18:11:08] <edk> the debian base install contains apache httpd and exim4
[18:11:10] <wink> yes and no. I've not needed a machine without curl for 10+ years
[18:11:32] <wink> openbsd installs ftp by default, we could have curl
[18:11:40] <cb> debian at least when i last used it came with wget but NOT curl
[18:11:43] <cb> opposite of most OSes nowadays
[18:12:16] <wink> I've not needed a machine without tmux, netcat and traceroute either, so maybe I am not a good example :D
[18:12:28] <wink> but curl is.. essential
[18:13:02] <edk> i mean, it's less essential than traceroute if you're a server, tbh
[18:14:02] <epilys> libcurl at least might be used by servers
[18:14:17] <edk> i hope not
[18:14:26] <kline> edk | the debian base install contains apache httpd and exim4
[18:14:30] <kline> theres always room for improvement
[18:14:56] <kline> that said i have no idea what the size difference between arch and debian base isntalls are, i suspect debian is competitive
[18:14:56] <edk> but if some server software needs libcurl its package will install that
[18:15:14] <edk> i didn't realise there was an arch base install
[18:15:38] <edk> isn't the whole arch deal that you have to make a bunch of relatively uninformed choices to get a working installation
[18:16:08] <edk> anyway the point is i don't think debian is trying to be a small base install, it's trying to be a useful computer out of the box

[18:29:03] <Foxboron> (You also get a less broken systemd integration)
[18:29:36] <martian67> arch has better packaging and less breaking than either debian unstable or debian testing
[18:29:52] <martian67> and AUR is miles better than PPA shit
[18:30:19] <martian67> even debian testing regularly blows up and requires manual intervention to unfuck it
[18:30:49] <martian67> arch has literally never done that to me in 15+ years of running it, in any serious apt/dpkg style cascade snafu
[18:31:14] <martian67> pacman is *super simple* and it doesnt make a lot of dumb assumptions that break, unlike apt and dpkg
[18:31:34] <Foxboron> You managed usrmerge *and* systemd migration without issues :p?
[18:31:35] <wink> martian67: that is 100% not my experience with testing. it averaged 1 break per year, or per 2 years

[18:32:18] <martian67> Foxboron:  just follow the directions they give explicitly, its not a big deal
[18:32:47] <martian67> apt and dpkg fuckups are far, far more annoying to deal with than pacman ones
[18:33:09] <martian67> and its almost always because something breaks eithers super complicated model of things
[18:33:23] <wink> I have hardly any experience with arch, I'm just saying testing has been fine since ~2014

[18:34:09] *** Joins: justOkay (~justache@user/justache)
[18:34:17] <martian67> and the hooks themselves are always run at the end, and *simple*
[18:34:44] <martian67> unlike dpkg which hooks pre-pre install, pre install, install, post install, and post-post install and whatever other shit
[18:35:06] <martian67> and has to run through this every single time you update your system and is a slow pain in the ass
[18:35:06] <Foxboron> We have that in pacman as well
[18:35:18] <Foxboron> But they are less used and centralized hooks are favoured in general
[18:35:53] <martian67> yeah its used for a small handful of things, not almost every package, unlike how debian works
[18:37:04] <martian67> meanwhile dpkg gets in a huge shitfit over multiple versions of packages and tries to be all things to all people
[18:37:11] <Foxboron> kline: but yeah, I'd be interested listening to what you mean with "reasonable advantage" :p
[18:37:17] <martian67> its just too complicated and extremely annoying when it breaks
[18:39:07] <martian67> debian testing just has no advantage over arch to me, id not use arch in say, running servers or something, because the structured nature of debian is an advantage in cases like that
[18:39:32] <martian67> but when i just want a system for me, arch is much more pleasant to use
[18:39:45] <martian67> and gets in my way far less
[18:40:10] <pushcx> My only gripe about Arch is how much manual work is required to rollback, pin, and unpin a package there is. I'd like a 'packman --borked whateverpkg' to rollback and pin until there's a new unborked release.
[18:41:10] <Foxboron> A lot of ground work has been done to support transactions in pacman.. but I think having "proper" transactions exposed to users have largely been abandoned.
[18:41:21] <martian67> i have only ever required a rollback just a tiny handful of times, ymmv of course, they tend not to agressively push broken stuff
[18:41:27] <Foxboron> Having some package rollback would be neat, but not great considering the rolling releasem odel.
[18:41:34] <edk> i can't remember the last time i've installed a ppa

[18:43:04] <martian67> debian feels like filling out paperwork to satisfy somebody else's abstract irrelivant desires
[18:43:14] <martian67> arch feels like *linux* to me, in the same way slackware did

[18:43:59] <edk> debian does get in my way sometimes, but it's pretty rare

[18:52:57] <martian67> but the makepkg(1) format is extremely straight forward, and easy to review

[19:11:46] <river> I think I should do that
[19:11:54] <river> write a tool that transforms a delete patch into a rm commands
[19:12:01] <wink> could escalate into a full blown 'extension', but then your inbetween thing woudl do 'rm -f file; git ci -m "done";"
[19:12:06] <river> it feels right on the edge of 'over-engineering something that people will hate me for'
[19:12:10] <wink> yep
[19:12:11] <river> but idk
[19:12:18] <river> i cant think of a smarter solution
[19:12:30] <wink> or find a strategy how to sell it as advanced cherry-picking magic
[19:12:41] <wink> maybe add a blockchain
[19:12:48] <wink> "we can't delete it"
[19:13:32] <wink> if space is not your problem you could also move it to an archive folder in your patch and then people "jsut commit rm -f archive/*" whenever you like
[19:13:40] <wink> *tell
[19:13:45] <river> omg
[19:13:54] <river> do mv's not include file content holy shit

[19:19:54] <martian67> river:  git-annex might interest you
[19:20:04] <martian67> its designed around handling binary files
[19:20:19] <martian67> but it doesn't do it in quite a transparent way, this may or may not matter to you
[19:20:53] <wink> I found it really weird to use, but yeah. depending on the problem it coudl either not apply at all or solve it
[19:20:57] <river> I suppose I should read up on it at least
[19:21:10] <martian67> using git on binaries is no beuneo
[19:21:26] <wink> depends. I'd say big and/or fast-changing ones
[19:21:28] <martian67> its entire model is just not a good fit
[19:21:40] <wink> having e.g. images (icons) for a website is 100% fine
[19:21:56] <wink> any overhead in having those separate is a lot worse
