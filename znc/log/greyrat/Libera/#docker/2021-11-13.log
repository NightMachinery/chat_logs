[00:42:53] <ueberall> Is someoen using "docker buildx build" in order to generate images for multiple architectures? I'd like to add a label with the correct org.opencontainers.image.base.digest value (here, for alpine:latest) and have not yet found an example. Also, I really don't understand where the following checksum stems from (which is the same regardless of the platform/architecture used):
[00:42:58] <ueberall> "=> [1/2] FROM docker.io/library/alpine:latest@sha256:00abeca57ca04b7672955453580fd51ab9ad1b4c5571b1e7643becaadb81b749"
[00:44:13] <ueberall> If you look at https://hub.docker.com/layers/alpine/library/alpine/latest/images/sha256-5e604d3358ab7b6b734402ce2e19ddd822a354dc14843f34d36c603521dbb4f9?context=explore, you see architecture-dependent digests (which I would expect should be used for the forementiond label).
[00:46:04] <ueberall> But then maybe I misread https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/tree/main/articles/oci-base-image-annotations#user-content-base-image-annotations ?

[07:24:40] <programmerq> smoking_gnu▸ completely depends. If you want a quick 2 minute "I want to try something in a blank ubuntu and then throw it away" then sure.
[07:25:10] <programmerq> you might be able to persist just a home directory and swap out a custom image as you rebuild it with different packages and the like
[07:25:35] <smoking_gnu> It's an "I want to compile something but my dependencies are fucked" type of thing
[07:25:37] <programmerq> but it'd be an uphill battle since docker is very opinionated around having one logical service/process in one container
[07:26:09] <programmerq> oh yeah, it's great for that sort of thing-- it's great for a one-off task like a fresh compile environment.
[07:26:39] <smoking_gnu> Would I make a custom image for that or exec into it?
[07:27:00] *** Quits: brachamh_ (~brachamh@user/brachamh) (Quit: Oops, I'll be back.)
[07:28:37] <programmerq> you could do something like: docker run --rm -it --name compileenv -v `pwd`:/hostdir ubuntu:latest bash
[07:29:09] <programmerq> and then from there apt install your compiler and dependencies and grab your source code. the /hostdir in the container can be where you put the build artifact. When you exit that bash shell, the --rm will clean up the container.
[07:29:38] <programmerq> if you wanted a repeatable environment, then you could do your apt install in a Dockerfile and use that image instead of manually installing it in a one-off vanilla container.
[07:35:02] <smoking_gnu> Thanks! I'll try that soon!

[07:35:09] <queue[m]> hmm what would be the point of docker VM vs LXC or just setting up a kvm and doing whatever you want
[07:35:14] <queue[m]> you'll have to implement gpu passthrough for the power
[07:35:28] <queue[m]> if it even works, id just kvm whatever you're looking for
[07:35:55] <queue[m]> or individualize the docker on the host itself as a container, the way god intended docker to work
[07:37:23] <queue[m]> you could even do something like https://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/config-reference/compute/hypervisor-kvm.html
[07:37:51] <queue[m]> just one little kvm out of openstack and do what you want knowing its better than any 'docker vm' could be, efficiently
[07:38:19] <smoking_gnu> The biggest thing with that is I'd need to access it with a terminal and not boxes

[08:24:57] <C0nundrum> ughu great
[08:25:25] <C0nundrum> i don't get it
[08:25:40] <C0nundrum> is this something locked to a compose version or forced in the binary ?
[08:26:30] <C0nundrum> o wow it looks like its forced by the binary.... nice. So much for versioning

[08:32:49] <queue[m]> in the context field, as i'd hope youve seen by now
[08:32:59] <C0nundrum> ...
[08:33:02] <C0nundrum> i haven't touched my files
[08:33:14] <C0nundrum> i'm on windows and i have scripts for building everything
[08:33:21] <queue[m]> so your structure of that locationing for the files rae right?
[08:33:22] <C0nundrum> things just stopped working so i had to come here and fix it
[08:33:26] <queue[m]> lol
[08:33:34] <C0nundrum>  its been there for a year plus
[08:33:38] <C0nundrum> whats funny about it?
[08:33:41] <queue[m]> i mean honestly i couldnt imagine why anyone would docker on windows
[08:33:45] <queue[m]> but to each their own
[08:34:27] <C0nundrum> Right, i have "my" reasons
[08:34:47] <queue[m]> what are the reasons you didnt run a VM and load linux, then docker?
[08:34:56] <queue[m]> that's the main insight
[08:34:57] <C0nundrum> Becuase i don't need to
[08:35:06] <C0nundrum> Docker for windows exists so i use it
[08:35:09] <queue[m]> uh, you do cause you're on windows bud
[08:35:11] <queue[m]> yet again
[08:35:24] <C0nundrum> your paranoia is forcing you to focus on useless details
[08:35:26] <queue[m]> your flaws are your own, ill leave you to them
[08:35:30] <C0nundrum> there is a syntax to a docker-compose file
[08:35:35] <queue[m]> nah i just dont bloat my life
[08:35:36] <C0nundrum> that is the subject of conversation ehre
[08:35:39] <C0nundrum> not my os
[08:35:46] <queue[m]> with windows && docker knowing its a cluster F
[08:36:01] <queue[m]> dumbest thing ive seen tbh w/ docker, ever
[08:36:01] <C0nundrum> It works fine when you know what your doing
[08:36:03] <queue[m]> docker on windows lol
[08:36:08] <queue[m]> no offense, just honesty
[08:36:11] <C0nundrum> i've have swamrm scew itself over on linux a million times at work so.... yea
[08:36:18] <queue[m]> coming from someone who does this for a living
[08:36:18] <C0nundrum> but again, off-topic
[08:36:26] <queue[m]> i think its hilarious
[08:36:37] <C0nundrum> Neat, glad you have something to laugh at
[08:36:45] <C0nundrum> i don' t rally care what makes you laugh
[08:36:46] <queue[m]> me too
[08:36:51] <queue[m]> i had a dry night, ty for the humor

[08:38:37] <C0nundrum> Right, and you have constant paranoia
[08:38:49] <queue[m]> but dont take me for my information,experience, use your own of course
[08:39:01] <queue[m]> dont take someone's word that wrote malware for the last 18+ years
[08:39:03] <queue[m]> thast just stupid
[08:39:05] <C0nundrum> i worked at AAA and i remember when they replaed secuity they threw all this useless shit and processes on our comps that cost the buissness money and slowed down processes 
[08:39:14] <C0nundrum> i'm an engineer i focus on solving problems, not talking about them
[08:39:19] <queue[m]> knowing that windows 10 is 100000x more hookable and since you're directly linking it to the windows fs
[08:39:22] <queue[m]> i mean go ahead bro
[08:39:27] <queue[m]> do you

[08:40:01] <queue[m]> free of charge
[08:40:19] <C0nundrum> your obviously looking for a fight. I had my fun so good night so this room can go back on topic
[08:40:21] <queue[m]> its not that
[08:40:35] <queue[m]> windows isnt trash, im on it right now though arch + i3wm + zsh is my normal
[08:40:42] <queue[m]> but when using docker? WTF
[08:40:45] <queue[m]> lmao

[08:58:04] <C0nundrum> ....
[08:58:21] <C0nundrum> Docker for windows handles bootstraping.... That's literilly the point of it

[09:00:44] <C0nundrum> I also have my owns reasons for bootstraping services with compose. Its the most retarded thing to come in a chat room about a topic and argu about about why your using the software in the way it's instructed to be used..
[09:00:53] <C0nundrum> u guys need a drink or something
[09:01:56] <tabakhase> that said, i think by default toolbox as well as "for-XY" share the whole disk of the system (same applies to wsl!) - otherwise "running docker on windows" can be said to be almost safer if were talking breaking out from inside a container rather than attacking windows itself :D
[09:02:12] <C0nundrum> That as well

[16:40:23] <queue[m]> eh i wasnt arguing, i just dont think people should docker on windows based on some active exploits going around right now
[16:40:58] <queue[m]> nothing more nothing less, i just have access to *sec areas where they are actually writing 0days. i dont enjoy that stuff but they are doing it and i've seen it work live in a pentesting lab
[16:42:19] <queue[m]> that also being said, there are more live exploits for windows than there are linux at this time (non-docker related)
[16:42:54] <queue[m]> this isnt me guessing, this isnt me talking out of my ass, this is me simply stating what i've seen
[16:44:11] <queue[m]> when covid hit, all they did was create sandbox escapes. in fact, they are the reason zerodium told people they werent accepting escapes anymore for pay
[16:45:27] <BtbN> What is it with docker sometimes randomly fails at DNS?
[16:45:34] <BtbN> Happens on my dev machine, happens on Github Actions
[16:45:42] <BtbN> sometimes, a container is just unable to resolve any names
[16:45:46] <queue[m]> tried declaring dns in the compose file?
[16:45:48] <BtbN> restart the same thing, and it works
[16:46:04] <BtbN> Why would a compose file magically fix this?
[16:46:16] <BtbN> (And it would also be highly impractical either way)
[16:46:19] <queue[m]> you dont have to use compose, you can set dns on docker run
[16:46:28] <BtbN> But why would I have to explicitly set them?
[16:46:32] <BtbN> It works 95% of the time
[16:46:38] <BtbN> just 5% of the time it randomly does not
[16:46:48] <queue[m]> i was offering a resolution without the work of troubleshooting
[16:47:09] <BtbN> And setting DNS Servers on Github Actions is not really a thing as well
[16:47:28] <BtbN> Github manages all that stuff
[16:47:54] <queue[m]> ?
[16:48:04] <queue[m]> dns servers on the container fool
[16:48:19] <queue[m]> dns: 1.1.1.1 ; 1.0.0.1 is how i'd do it in compose, im not sure how it looks on docker run
[16:48:24] <queue[m]> you could try it, or not, its up to you
[16:48:25] <BtbN> Yes, Github controls the container...
[16:48:33] <BtbN> I have no way to pass any such options to it
[16:48:46] <queue[m]> that sounds like a problem in its own
[16:48:53] <BtbN> That's just how CI works
[16:49:05] <queue[m]> i build CI/CD pipelines, never heard of this
[16:49:18] <BtbN> You must have never used Github Actions or the Gitlab equivalent
[16:49:25] <BtbN> the containers you run in are managed by the CI environment
[16:49:26] <queue[m]> correct
[16:49:30] <queue[m]> not with docker
[16:49:39] *** Quits: Keridos (~Keridos@ironhide.de) (Quit: ZNC - http://znc.in)
[16:49:46] <BtbN> The whole thing runs in docker
[16:49:50] <BtbN> You cannot not run in docker
[16:50:12] <queue[m]> i know but im just wondering why you can't add an option to a command string @ run to include dns
[16:50:15] *** Joins: Keridos (~Keridos@ironhide.de)
[16:50:42] <queue[m]> if github actions honestly stops you from that, it seems like a bug not a feature
[16:50:56] <BtbN> Because I never see or set or run any command string.
[16:51:05] <BtbN> Your CI script just runs in a Github Provided container.
[16:51:56] <BtbN> You can then go and run ANOTHER container, since their container has access to dockerd. But that's stupid overhead for most simple jobs.
[16:52:13] <queue[m]> beyond that, have you gone into the docker shell
[16:52:24] <queue[m]> docker exec -it githubactions sh
[16:52:24] <BtbN> Again... it's Github Actions
[16:52:31] <queue[m]> cat /etc/resolv.conf
[16:52:35] <queue[m]> yea idk bro i wouldnt work like that
[16:52:47] <queue[m]> thats almost like a mac environment where you can't make adjustments
[16:52:51] <BtbN> You seriously seem to have trouble understanding what automated CI is.
[16:52:53] <queue[m]> you have to do it the way they want or gtfo lol
[16:53:04] <BtbN> There is no shell.
[16:53:09] <queue[m]> no i know what CI is, i just dont know the way you're doing it
[16:53:19] <BtbN> What do you mean, the way I'm doing it?
[16:53:29] <BtbN> I have a normal Github Workflow, and it does stuff to build and test its project.
[16:53:37] <BtbN> Just rarely, it has no working DNS
[16:53:43] <BtbN> then I restart the same job, and it works
[16:53:48] <queue[m]> yea i get that but how do you troubleshoot
[16:53:55] <BtbN> And I sometimes, equally rarely, observe the same thing locally
[16:53:55] <queue[m]> do you see the breakup
[16:54:11] <BtbN> So it seems like an issue with docker itself, rather than with GHA
[16:54:52] <BtbN> And it's not like I can reliably reproduce it. Just notice it when my build randomly failed. At which point it's too late to investigate.
[16:54:54] <queue[m]> moreso sounds like an environment limitation, i have about 20 containers right now that are fine with dns
[16:55:04] <queue[m]> including using my own dns servers, which is why i declare dns: in the first place
[16:55:19] <BtbN> No idea what an "environment limitation" on two entirely disconnected things would be
[16:55:26] <BtbN> It works fine for me as well. Sometimes for days on end
[16:55:33] <BtbN> But then one odd job just randomly fails
[16:55:46] <queue[m]> uh the fact you cant access 'docker run' command
[16:55:49] <queue[m]> thats a HUGE flaw
[16:56:02] <queue[m]> you cant shell in to test anything, you just have to hope it works yea?
[16:56:04] <queue[m]> sounds great
[16:56:45] <BtbN> What the hell are you even going on about?
[16:56:48] <BtbN> This is on Github Actions
[16:56:52] <BtbN> it's a CI service you send scripts to
[16:56:54] <BtbN> you can't ssh to it
[16:58:31] <queue[m]> so you cant open shell on a docker container you currently have running
[16:58:38] <queue[m]> is that what you're telling me, you cant run commands at all
[16:58:44] <BtbN> You write a CI script
[16:58:51] <BtbN> and it then runs on the events you defined it to run on
[16:58:54] <queue[m]> im not asking you about the CI script, you're in #docker
[16:59:07] <BtbN> The CI runs in docker...
[16:59:15] <BtbN> And it shows an issue I also see with docker locally.
[16:59:20] <BtbN> So it's very likely a docker issue.
[16:59:44] <queue[m]> ok,  if the CI is running in docker, then you could run commands to it from the outside and configure the way it does 'docker run'
[16:59:48] <queue[m]> how do you start up the docker container?
[16:59:54] <BtbN> Are you trolling?
[17:00:14] <BtbN> It's Github Actions. Someone makes a PR or pushes something. And it start up the container and runs the tests.

[17:00:20] <queue[m]> no im actually trying to figure out your setup because this is confusing, ive never met anyone that couldnt get into their container

[17:02:08] <BtbN> Specially funny when a container running on Github can't resolve github.com

[17:06:42] <BtbN> Or maybe look up what it does first

[17:08:28] <queue[m]> mr "i cant access my docker run command"
[17:08:46] <queue[m]> you put yourself in that environment and then you dont know what environment limitations are

[17:09:15] <BtbN> Yeah, go ahead and listen to the guy/gal throwing around insults. What could possibly go wrong lol
[17:09:23] <queue[m]> anyone in here will tell you to force kill the container riv
[17:09:33] <queue[m]> and if not you can prune the containers, the ones that are running wont be touched

[17:12:39] <BtbN> The one that makes you look like a 12 year old clueless kid
[17:12:40] <queue[m]> i have 20 containers up and about 40% of them i made on my own
[17:12:42] <riv> https://bpa.st/4MQQ
[17:12:45] <riv> so it does all this every time
[17:12:55] <riv> i was wondering if i could get it to download the stuff and build in 2 steps?
[17:13:02] <riv> so that it doesn't need to redownload all that stuff
[17:13:13] <queue[m]> can you share the dockerfile
[17:13:15] <BtbN> A container _just_ to build go is maybe a bit overkill
[17:13:25] <riv> I also run the program after building it
[17:13:43] <BtbN> You can use a super minimal "container" for that with Go. With literally just the binary, no OS
[17:14:03] <riv> https://github.com/rain-1/go-pages/blob/master/Dockerfile
[17:14:26] <riv> I am guessing split go install into two steps somehow?
[17:15:51] <BtbN> I'd probably not bother to put the build toolchain into a container
[17:16:08] <BtbN> And for the final binary it's also not strictly neccesary, unless your deployment env works that way
[17:16:32] <riv> will it make it simpler not to? I only have the source code so the stuff needs built at some point
[17:16:40] <BtbN> go produces fully standalone binaries. So you can do "FROM scratch" "ADD mybinary" containers and they'll work
[17:17:00] <riv> i see
[17:17:03] <riv> i will try it
[17:17:29] <BtbN> Obviously still needs a few volumes and port binds to actually be useful most of the time
