[08:43:54] <Sousapro> Easiest answer if you can
[08:44:16] <MikeSpears> very rarely does any real production network have the latest firmware on routers/switches
[08:44:20] <Sousapro> They are never powered on without a solid network that way
[08:44:32] <MikeSpears> UNLESS it's a major security/stability fix
[08:44:46] <sd> 02<r​yalln> tbh, i dont think these arubas have had a update since they where plugged in

[08:45:03] <Sousapro> Probably a lot of vulns then

[08:45:36] <Sousapro> Security will eventually make loud bird noises if you're years behind

[08:47:28] <xe0n> so the question you can ask support is: what is the guidance to updating the switches without causing any further issues

[08:47:44] <Sousapro> In all fairness, that's most hypervisors

[08:47:59] <xe0n> so you were doing this during the day? :P

[19:47:52] <Activ8> Lets just increase jail time and introduce the death penalty for breaking the law.
[19:47:59] <PublicWiFi> passwords with scripts are always a struggle
[19:48:17] <PublicWiFi> ultimately you're storing a file with a password (encrypted I'd hope) somewhere
[19:48:24] <csws> yeah though there are options for managing secrets in shit like azure
[19:48:30] <signofzeta> Well, we have OAuth.  We have tokens.  We have MFA.  We just need to trickle these down into the enterprise.  If Windows Server 20XX came out with it built-in, it wouldn't be an issue.
[19:48:33] <csws> and if you're running the script within azure ofc you have a principal to work with
[19:48:40] <csws> but when it's just powershell running on a shitty windows box welp
[19:48:46] <signofzeta> And I know ADFS can do that, but that's a lot of setup that most people don't bother with.

[19:49:55] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> even with a secrets manager it's either secured with a password or by security identifier, which is then again secured with just a cert with a password or something

[19:50:36] <csws> if I'e got your DA but want access to your cloud crap then if I find some random script you've got lying around and inevitably gave way too much access to the service account for.. then there's a foothold
