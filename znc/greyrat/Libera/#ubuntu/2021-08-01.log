[02:53:22] <Guest25> I have been trying ubuntu out on a 2015 iMac. It seems to work fine except for shutdown. It won't shutdown. It ends up hanging up and then rebooting. Choosing to restart instead of shutdown works fine. I've looked through a bunch of threads various places I've found searching the internet but none of the typical grub kernel command line tricks seem
[02:53:22] <Guest25> to work. Does anyone have any experience with this issue on a 2015 21.5" iMac?

[03:08:23] <Guest25> Yes, same issue.
[03:10:26] <Guest25> I reinstalled a couple of times after reloading mac os and making sure it shutdowns properly which it does. Latest test was the current LTS version which I just downloaded. 20.04.2.0. I booted from USB and did the try instead of install and it happens there too.

[03:13:45] <Guest25> I was considering trying debian testing or something next just to see if it's a kernel issue that might be fixed in a newer kernel. I was just hoping someone had run into this before. I've only had to deal with issues like this once or twice in linux before and I don't know very much about troubleshooting issues like this. This feels like it might
[03:13:45] <Guest25> be a tricky one to sort out.
[03:14:50] <src> how about downloading 21.04 before going so far as to install debian testing

[03:23:31] <leftyfb> Guest25: you can run the 5.10 and 5.11 kernel in ubuntu 20.04. No need to upgrade to 21.04
[03:23:32] <src> Guest25: hopefully needless to say, but your 20.04 installation is fully up to date?
[03:24:17] <leftyfb> Guest25: linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04-edge will give you the 5.11 kernel
[03:25:03] <Guest25> It's got Mac OS on it right now. I just ran 20.04 again from the USB drive to see if changing the wake on lan or power settings would make a difference. Didn't seem to change anything so I'll go ahead and try 21.04 since I've got in downloading to USB now. Shouldn't take too long to install.

[03:43:33] <ubottu> Guest25: If your system is unstable or power management does not work well and logs show ACPI issues, you can try to make the Linux kernel pretend it was Windows during boot (which can help on hardware which was only tested with Windows): http://iam.tj/prototype/enhancements/Windows-acpi_osi.html
[03:44:19] *** Joins: james_la1 (~jameslavi@ool-457981b2.dyn.optonline.net)
[03:44:22] <tomreyn> this approach (trying to make it look like windows) may seem weird here, but it could still work.
[03:45:36] <tomreyn> acpi is the "advanced configuration and power interface", it's a way for firmware and OS to talk to each other, and handle power management (such as power off) events and firmware configurations queries.

I'm just waiting to see if it's going to reboot or just freeze forever. Usually in the past it would reboot. If it just hangs that's at least different behavior.

[03:49:16] <optimant> Guest25: do you know the model name of your specific iMac? you said 2015 and 21.5" so I think it's iMac16,1 or iMac16,2 but that can help search for bug reports and the like. (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634)
[03:52:00] <tomreyn> the only things that should really matter there linux-wise are the kernel version and * really just maybe * the systemd version. as leftyfb pointed out (twice now ;-) ) you can switch between different kernel versions while you have an LTS release (20.04 being the latest) installed - it's probably good enough for testing.

And I want to switch the arch to ubuntu. win10 and arch are installed on different harddisks, however right now my /boot folder is on the disk that arch is installed on. I can see in my /boot/efi/EFI folder there are some Microsoft files so I am worried writing ubuntu onto this disk will screw up the
[06:50:20] <Batzy> windows boot. Anyone have any advice or guides to handle something like that, or should I just not be worried?

[07:02:39] <Batzy> sda still is windows system files
[07:03:32] <tomreyn> okay, so about sdc, you said "the boot partition is on /dev/sdc1", this sounds like arch's /boot mount comes from /dev/sdc1. but that would mean the efi system partition is somewhere else. where is it?

[07:39:44] <Technoturnovers> I did boot without secure boot to install nvidia drivers
[07:39:51] <Technoturnovers> but that didn't make any change
[07:40:05] <Batzy> tomreyn install finished and it boots windows just fine. im going to guess the ubuntu is also going to be fine
[07:40:37] <tomreyn> Batzy: if it booted it through grub, then probably so
[07:41:29] <Technoturnovers> oh and also, not sure if this is kubuntu only, but I've got a different, kind of urgent bug with the installer to discuss
[07:41:34] <frickenate> Please, I need urgent help. I have a fresh Ubuntu 21.04 server, and I need to create a normal user who can connect via ftp to upload me a large file. It's a throwaway; I care very little for security, thus I want my friend to drop me a file via ftp rather than via ssh/sftp. I create the user (sudo useradd -m sean), set their password (sudo passwd sean), and add "sean" to /etc/ftpusers.
[07:41:46] <frickenate> Server restart, and yet I still can't ftp to the server as "sean".
[07:41:50] <tomreyn> Batzy: the kubuntu installation should be about as simple if you want to try again
[07:42:16] <Technoturnovers> frickenate: using SSH would actually be easier
[07:42:33] <tomreyn> frickenate: i second this.
[07:42:45] <Technoturnovers> FTP servers are a massive pain, in my experience
[07:42:45] <tomreyn> winscp if they're a windows user
[07:43:10] <Technoturnovers> also, I know this is a dumb question, but did you port forward?
[07:43:12] <frickenate> And in fact, even if I set "PasswordAuthentication yes" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, I can't even connect via ssh. Something is really fucked up.
[07:43:37] <frickenate> ssh as the new user, the first time, gives "Too many authentication failures"
[07:43:58] <frickenate> I've never seen this problem. I feel like it's probably some new garbage systemd

[07:44:53] <Batzy> quick question...how do i set my primary display on ubuntu? I have 3 monitors and both the login screen and actual system have the wrong display as the main one. I reordered the displays so my mouse moves properly, but how do i switch everything to my middle display?

[08:40:59] <alkisg> technoturnovers: and when you try to boot ubuntu, you press f12 to select ubuntu (as windows is first), and you remove the usb stick (in case it confuses shim)?
[08:41:05] <technoturnovers> hmmm.... so I would delete all of my shim keys with mokutil, when reimport the canonical cert with mokmanager?
[08:41:17] <alkisg> technoturnovers: shim is signed with the microsoft key
[08:41:26] <alkisg> You don't need to import anything for shim or grub
[08:41:35] <alkisg> If you're using dkms drivers, THEN you'd need the canonical key to be able to load them
[08:41:46] <technoturnovers> shim evals grub with its own keys
[08:41:51] <alkisg> AFAIK nvidia is signed with canonical keys?
[08:42:02] <alkisg> shim has the canonical keys integrated
[08:42:18] <technoturnovers> no it doesn't, the canonical key is stored in NVRAM
[08:42:26] <technoturnovers> you can see if you check mokutil
[08:42:41] <technoturnovers> that's how shim works
[08:43:04] <alkisg> And then we are we able to boot live cds/usbs in new pcs?
[08:43:10] <alkisg> *why
[08:43:33] <alkisg> # mokutil --list-enrolled
[08:43:34] <alkisg> MokListRT is empty
[08:43:48] <alkisg> No mok keys are needed to boot ubuntu
[08:44:03] <technoturnovers> well I have the canonical keys in my mokutil
[08:44:18] <alkisg> Yes, and I'm saying "try to delete them in case they cause issues"
[08:44:28] <alkisg> It's possible that ubuntu-drivers or something, detected your nvidia, and put them
[08:45:11] <technoturnovers> I gotta do this tomorrow, I have to go to bed rn
[08:45:18] <alkisg> At some point nvidia drivers switched from "dkms compiled" to " ubuntu compiled". Maybe at that point, ubuntu started putting its keys in mok somehow
[08:45:18] <alkisg> Sure, cheers
[08:45:20] <technoturnovers> i'll try that

[08:59:45] <alkisg> technoturnovers (if he reads logs, or if anyone will notify him when he comes back):
[08:59:45] <alkisg> another simple test for you would be "burn ubuntu.iso and try to boot it with secure boot enabled"
[09:00:08] <alkisg> If that works, then you should fix your hard disk installation; if not, you could either fix it from the firmware, or it's a shim bug and it can't be quickly fixed

[10:19:37] <alkisg> mikeeq_: which graphics card/drivers do you have?
[10:20:11] <mikeeq_> alkisg: I don't have a gfx card. It is an intel NUC from a noname brand.
[10:20:41] <alkisg> mikeeq_: are you booted in compatibility mode now?
[10:21:23] <mikeeq_> well, I installed in compatibility mode, and now that it's installed i'm booted from the recovery option in grub.
[10:21:33] <mikeeq_> I guess that 's the same thing
[10:21:41] <alkisg> OK. What's the output of this command? lspci -nn -k | grep -A3 VGA
[10:22:15] <mikeeq_> alkisg: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Skylake GT2 [HD Graphics 520] [8086:1916] (rev 07)

[10:22:53] <alkisg> mikeeq_: now that you're booted in compatibility mode, did you load graphics, xorg, a desktop environment?
[10:23:53] <mikeeq_> alkisg: yes, I'm in the desktop now.
[10:23:54] <alkisg> Or are you in terminal mode?
[10:24:03] <mikeeq_> but everything is huge resolution
[10:24:22] <mikeeq_> if i boot normally, it looks good, but locks up after a couple seconds

[10:26:26] <alkisg> OK so the problem probably is your graphics drivers; when they're loaded, the hang up your system somehow
[10:26:46] <alkisg> One thing that you could do would be to change your kernel
[10:26:52] <alkisg> What's your current kernel? uname -a
[10:27:14] <mikeeq_> alkisg: Linux mike-office 5.11.0-25-generic #27-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 9 23:06:29 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[10:27:27] <alkisg> Ah, are you on ubuntu 21.04?
[10:28:54] <mikeeq_> alkisg: yes, techinically lubuntu, but I went through the same problems on vanilla ubuntu yesterday.
[10:29:25] <alkisg> So, ubuntu 21.04 has kernel=5.11, while 20.04.1 has kernel=5.4, and 20.04.2 has kernel=5.8
[10:29:36] <alkisg> I would suggest that you try with a live cd of 20.04.1 or 20.04.2
[10:29:51] <alkisg> If it works there, then you can downgrade your kernel even in 21.04 if you wish
[10:30:11] <mikeeq_> alkisg: ok. I am pretty sure I had it working normally a few years ago. just dusted it off yesterday.
[10:30:40] <mikeeq_> alkisg: i guess I thought it was hard or not possible to downgrade kernels.
[10:35:19] <Bashing-om> !hwe | mikeeq_
[10:35:19] <ubottu> mikeeq_: The Ubuntu LTS enablement stacks provide newer kernel and X support for existing LTS releases, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack

[10:37:14] <usr123> I tried placing the ttf in my ~/.fonts directory. I also tried the solution mentioned here: https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=278440. Both of those don't seem to work. In the terminal I don't see Monaco listed in the Custom font dropdown.
[10:37:21] <mikeeq_> alkisg: ah yes, I understand. thanks for your help :)

[20:19:17] <Guest25> ah
[20:19:22] <tomreyn> In my exoperience, AP mode is difficult to stabilize with external (USB connected) wireless devices
[20:19:23] <Guest25> I must go there?

[20:20:21] <tomreyn> this is mostly system related
[20:21:23] <Guest25> The GUI seems very dynamic according to hardware it detects, buttons, menus, elements just disappear or appear, yet in "Connections - System Settings Module" there is a "Configuration" button and it opens a new dialog with hotspot settings,  default is "username-hotspot" ... but I can't find anything how to activate the one that's built in
[20:21:30] <tomreyn> if you need this to work in a stable manner, i recommend you get a PCI connected wireless chipset which runs with open source drivers and is known to work in AP mode

[20:24:39] <tomreyn> in gnome, you can go to settings -> wireless and add a new connection, type AP, and bring that up.
