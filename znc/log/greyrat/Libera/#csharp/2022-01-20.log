[00:00:53] <JakeSays> Nasp: usage, or honoring of?
[00:00:54] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Why is that though? Doesn't the thing have 4 cores?
[00:01:06] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Is anyone is using DNT
[00:01:08] <Nasp> Any end user
[00:01:11] <Nasp> Not the website is honoring it
[00:01:25] <MatthiasVance> DNT sounds like the decentralized Torrent protocol?
[00:01:33] <MichaelLong> how about buying a bananapi, orangepi, rockchip, phyboard, odroid, beagleboard/bone (only to name a few) as a replacement?
[00:01:34] <Nasp> I kinda want to add it to our site so atleaast the people who know of DNT does'nt have to accept / decline anything
[00:01:34] <MatthiasVance> (but of course it's the Do Not Track header)
[00:01:42] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Please do < 3
[00:02:04] <MatthiasVance> I first installed an extension " I don't care about cookies" . That clicks away all those things xD
[00:02:09] <MatthiasVance> But now I manually reject them all
[00:02:10] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: again, it has *nothing* to do with resource usage. you'll be printing something and then need to upgrade/change HA and fuck up your print, or need to reboot after tweaking octoprint and fuck up HA, etc.
[00:02:24] <MatthiasVance> Ohh I am totally not worried about that
[00:02:47] <JakeSays> you will be young man. you will be.

[00:05:26] <MatthiasVance> Might be buying better PLA :D
[00:05:31] <JakeSays> Nasp: that's because you never print anything:p
[00:05:50] <MatthiasVance> Some stuff prints fine but these small units don't

[00:06:24] <MatthiasVance> So apparently HomeAssistant is already running somewhere .. BUT WHERE
[00:06:25] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i actually have never had an issue with small prints.
[00:06:43] <JakeSays> it's the big flat ones that have trouble sticking

[00:19:39] <Nasp> khanred:  Yes

[02:00:27] <brianonymous_> i have multiple threads, all hungry little bastids.. and i also have.. lets call it a cache layer. What id like is, if its a cache miss, id fire off a task to fill cache. but if another thread came looking for the same spot, i would like to await on the same task the first one fired off
[02:01:24] <brianonymous_> then when filler task is done, all is released and everyone is happy

[02:02:06] <brianonymous_> but i was aiming more along a list of Task<poops>
[02:02:30] <brianonymous_> but i suspect if i await TaskList[x], i end up just firing a new one off

[03:46:43] <Xenoprimate> It has a lot of features but I find its UI to be pretty obnoxious. It's allergic to drag-and-drop. And that stupid "live song" mode has too much prominence for me. I just want a real DAW for recording and producing and mixing, I don't care about playing live

[04:15:30] <brianonymous_> i scrapped sqlite :(
[04:15:40] <bpmedley> brianonymous_ : Why?
[04:16:09] <brianonymous_> it just couldnt keep up with the demand i needed.. it was triggering disk IO alerts on the qa box, lawl
[04:16:16] <bpmedley> Dang
[04:16:22] <brianonymous_> admittingly, i asked a lot of it
[04:16:57] <brianonymous_> BUT AS A RESULT... i came up with a homebrew lazy loading cache schema that blows the doors off the original requirements
[04:17:11] <bpmedley> cool
[04:17:24] <bpmedley> does it use .json files or anything?
[04:17:34] <brianonymous_> all in mem.. but allocated in hourly blocks
[04:18:04] <brianonymous_> when cold, just that initial hour fill is required for the first request.. then if its not touched in awhile, it vaporizes

[04:25:37] <Suchiman> brianonymous_: but if disk I/O was a trouble, could have also used :memory: as database path :trollface:
[04:25:46] <brianonymous_> i thought about that too
[04:26:01] <brianonymous_> but that would cause stress to the core systems
[04:26:12] <brianonymous_> cuz then i gotta backfill 3 days worth of shit on startup
[04:26:41] <Suchiman> brianonymous_: isn't that what you ended up with basically?
[04:26:45] <brianonymous_> this cache miss system in hour memory block is best of all worlds
[04:26:59] <brianonymous_> no, cuz now i only backfill what i need for that hour window
[04:27:12] <brianonymous_> and as i walk, i can advance backfill the next hour coming, etc
[04:27:21] <brianonymous_> but only once
[04:27:40] <Suchiman> brianonymous_: and the backfilling is that Task thingy huh?
[04:27:44] <brianonymous_> it was indeed
[04:27:49] <GunArm1> sn.exe doesn't seem to have anyway to check error codes or anything, so in order to put it in a script as a validation step, it's looking like i'll have to parse the strings it outputs
[04:28:00] <Suchiman> brianonymous_: simple solution working well, eh?
[04:28:21] <brianonymous_> Suchiman: i think so! thank you for that... it isnt complaining yet :D
[04:28:37] <Suchiman> neat

[04:29:16] <brianonymous_> var  qTime = GetQuantizedDateTime(programClock); <- seggsy

[04:29:42] <Suchiman> concurrently even
[04:29:44] <brianonymous_> Suchiman: for some reason i was thinking itd just fork off a new path
[04:30:49] <Suchiman> nah, calling a async method is what runs the path until it must wait where it yields, returning the task which await then waits for its completion by yielding itself again
[04:31:19] <Suchiman> or noticing it completed and taking a synchronous fast path to just retrieve the .Result
[04:31:26] <brianonymous_> it saved a lot of boiler plate event waiting, for sure
[04:32:50] <brianonymous_> the funny part of the sqlite hangup was that it was clearly IO driven wait load.. cpu would chill at like 20%
[04:33:48] <Suchiman> brianonymous_: and if you had to make methods async so that they can await the one time initialization of the cache, which means they have to allocate a Task on each call to await the cache filling that only happens once, you can make them ValueTask instead, then you're allocation free when the cache is already initialized (and no yielding happens) otherwise the ValueTask gets boxed to the hepa
[04:34:42] <brianonymous_> its actually triggered by kestrel requests
[04:35:02] <brianonymous_> so im coming in with thread ids all over the map
[04:36:25] <brianonymous_> im running a test stream right now, and i just crossed my first hour boundary test and didnt notice
[04:36:43] <brianonymous_> i suppose thats a good sign :D

[04:46:11] <Cecen> Is there any way to define symbols for referenced projects, when you can't make assumptions about how the project will be built and the referenced projects aren't in the same directory as the solution?
[04:46:27] <Cecen> The only guarantee is that the build will start with a project in the solution directory
[04:54:39] <teegee> wpf question. I have a listbox that's two-way binding to a ObservableCollection<Person> People property in my view model. the view model implements INotifyPropertyChanged. The Person class overwrites ToString() so that the listbox can show a useful string instead of just the name of the class. I bound the SelectedItem to a Person property which is
[04:54:39] <teegee> bound to a different view so I can modify the properties of the Person. But changing the person doesn't update the listbox. If I add a datatemplate to the listbox and bind to the actual properties of the Person class, they update as I type. why isn't the ToString() called again and the simple listbox updated when I modify the selected item?
[05:01:44] <brianonymous_> Cecen: i think you can only do that if you have the symbols from the actual build
[05:01:52] <brianonymous_> teegee: im too wpf dumb
[05:02:10] <Cecen> I mean preprocessor symbols
[05:02:13] <brianonymous_> o
[05:02:54] <brianonymous_> could you do conditional var writing to something
[05:03:34] <brianonymous_> like a feature flag set
[05:04:48] <Cecen> How would you propagate it to the referenced project?
[05:04:54] <jonp> Cecen: a Condition property on <DefineConstants/>?
[05:05:13] <Cecen> DefineConstants don't make it to the referenced project afair
[05:05:15] <Cecen> Let me double check
[05:05:23] <jonp> indeed not
[05:05:29] <jonp> but. you could use Directory.Build.props…
[05:05:37] <Cecen> I can't make any assumption about the directory structure
[05:05:58] <jonp> *force* some *requirements*

[05:32:50] <Suchiman> Cecen: the best way to deal with that i think is having a project configuration for every possible set of symbols and then in the sln pick the configuration you'd like, e.g. instead of Release, Release_Whatever
[05:33:34] <Cecen> It may not be built with the sln :(
[05:33:57] <Cecen> In fact, the build usually starts at the csproj
[05:37:19] <Suchiman> Cecen: and i guess passing /p:DefineConstants=Whatever at build time isn't an option?
[05:38:13] <Cecen> Right, there are at least 3 different build pipelines
[05:40:14] <Suchiman> Cecen: create a different csproj for every set of defines and import the common bits of the csproj into each of them
[05:40:28] <Suchiman> possibly using Directory... files
[05:40:34] <Suchiman> in the same folder as the csproj
[05:41:37] <Cecen> Can you target import another project file?
[05:42:14] <Cecen> I can't use a Directory props because at least one scenario has a nested utility project that would pick it up
[05:42:26] <Suchiman> Cecen: i think so

[13:52:50] <jmer> eurogos: I don't think it makes sense to POST WITH an ID
[13:52:56] <MatthiasVance> eurogos: Are you using an API controller?
[13:52:57] <jmer> eurogos: then it hsould be a PUT
[13:53:11] <jmer> the only way you can allready have the ID is if it's an update of exisiting data
[13:53:12] <MatthiasVance> eurogos: Do yourself a huge favor and use API conventions attribute somewhere on your assembly :)
[13:53:17] <MatthiasVance> Then you get guidance on all this
[13:53:19] <eurogos> its actually a funny one, its an endpoint which triggers a password reset request
[13:53:49] <eurogos> so i suppose its creating a new reset request each time
[14:05:56] <MatthiasVance> So this has nothing to do with users eurogos ?
[14:06:12] <MatthiasVance> And why isn't that a pluralized route?
[14:06:15] <Nasp> Yay disabled analytics and only need one consent flow
[14:06:38] <Nasp> jmer:  Post with id can make sense
[14:06:38] <eurogos> i just simplified my example
[14:06:45] <Nasp> But remember you can bind routes to a model as well
[14:07:04] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  What API conventions attributes are you talking about?
[14:07:08] <eurogos> the actual endpoints are POST /api/v1/resetpassword/{userid}
[14:07:24] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/advanced/conventions?view=aspnetcore-6.0
[14:07:31] <Nasp> Is that action made by the user themselves?
[14:07:55] <eurogos> its the one that is triggered from the i've forgotten my password link
[14:07:58] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Ohh that
[14:08:06] <Nasp> Hmm not sure what advantage it gives
[14:08:14] <Nasp> Also wouldn't i need to make my own
[14:08:45] <eurogos> the UI hits up the API on that link and then the API just forwards the request to the identity server
[14:08:57] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: The defaults are pretty good
[14:09:03] <Nasp> But what are those :D
[14:09:05] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: And otherwise it's only one class for your entire assembly
[14:09:13] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: You can read more of the documentation ... xD
[14:09:46] <Nasp> But it doesnt quite explain it well tbh
[14:10:06] <Nasp> [ApiConventionMethod(typeof(DefaultApiConventions),  nameof(DefaultApiConventions.Put))]
[14:10:13] <Nasp> But is it thsoe that helps the analyzer give recommendations?

[14:16:49] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[14:17:29] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: You create one class with static thingies and then you set an assembly attribute that uses that class for analyzers
[14:17:38] <MatthiasVance> It's unrelated to OpenAPI

[14:17:57] <Nasp> Well i've been wanting to add some of those analyzers to force people top use ActionResult<T>

[15:52:52] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[15:52:55] <Tobbi_> Ah
[15:52:56] <jmer> but that's a law you can exploit to the extreme
[15:53:03] <MatthiasVance> jmer: "I just host other people's plants"
[15:53:07] <jmer> I mean... 5 plants, grown the right way can still net you several kilos
[15:53:15] <MatthiasVance> Noo there's also a limit on that I think
[15:53:18] <Tobbi_> Have one plant grow extremely large
[15:53:40] <jmer> there are techniques where you brow the plant horrisontally and let the offshoots grow into "plants"
[15:53:50] <jmer> but it will still only have one root system and technically it's ONE plant
[15:54:00] <jmer> brow = bend

[15:54:20] <jmer> Nasp: as in a kilo og weed
[15:54:26] <Nasp> -For 5 plants?
[15:54:32] <jmer> yes if you grow the plants correctly
[15:54:38] <Nasp> That sounds rather insane
[15:54:43] <jmer> it takes longer ofc.
[15:54:45] <Nasp> Thought it would be a few grams

[15:54:53] <jmer> someone will definately do it
[15:55:10] <jmer> Nasp: no... with just normal techniques getting 100 grams pr. plant isn't unrealistic
[15:55:18] <jmer> ofc .depending on strain, the light and how skilled you are
[15:55:23] <Nasp> That's still 500grams short :d
[15:55:29] <Nasp> And even more of several kilos
[15:55:37] <Nasp> Does NL have a 5 plant law?
[15:55:42] <Nasp> So yeah make it huuuuge
[15:55:43] <jmer> If you bend the plant and grow it horizontally each offshoot will be as big as one plant :P
[15:57:00] <jmer> But you could also just let them grow very large

[15:59:48] <jmer> but the sativa dominated strains can get quite high

[16:10:12] <Nasp> Same with gun laws
[16:10:23] <Nasp> But yeah some will continue legal or not
[16:10:27] <Nasp> But would more people start
[16:10:40] <Nasp> And where should we accept it, everywhere or at cafes like in NL
[16:10:52] <jmer> the difference between guns and drugs is that guns tend to have other  victims than yourself
[16:11:21] <jmer> If drugs should be illegal because they are bad for you, why isn't alcohol illegal?
[16:11:28] <jmer> Why aren't fatty foods illegal?
[16:11:30] <jmer> etc etc
[16:11:58] <interop_madness> drugs also have other victims than just the addict
[16:12:11] <interop_madness> family members, close friends etc
[16:12:14] <jmer> interop_madness: If you are thinking relatives, so does alcohol.
[16:12:16] <jonp> as does alcohol, and cigarettes, and…
[16:12:48] <interop_madness> ∈ drugs
[16:12:48] <jmer> and there are many, many people who uses drugs occasionally without ruining their lives.
[16:12:55] <jmer> But these fly under the radar
[16:13:27] <jmer> hell they find cocaine on the toilets in Christiansborg (the place where the danish politicians work) xD
[16:13:35] <Nasp> I would argue that smokin hurts other victims as well
[16:13:44] <jmer> Nasp: not if you are mindful of where you smoke.
[16:14:00] <Nasp> Which people of drugs are ofc :D
[16:14:15] <Nasp> using*
[16:14:18] <Nasp> Man i can't speak
[16:14:22] <jmer> you're basing this on a stereotype of the drug addict portrayed in media
[16:14:36] <jmer> Nasp: Do you act like an alcholic just because you get drunk once in a while?
[16:15:22] <interop_madness> i think this whole drug legalization debate is part of a larger debate about things that game our nucleus accumbens
[16:15:28] <interop_madness> like social media, for example
[16:15:48] <jmer> interop_madness: I would definately back an argument claiming socail media has done more damage to society than drugs
[16:16:09] <interop_madness> should a society allow things that people have poor capacities against becoming addicted to it?
[16:16:15] <jmer> Yes
[16:16:23] <jmer> if not, we're no longer a free society
[16:16:40] * jmer is addicted to burgers
[16:16:41] <interop_madness> we never were and not being free is not inherently wrong
[16:16:57] <Nasp> jmer:  No that's just by looking out the street
[16:17:04] <Nasp> Remember big city :D
[16:17:04] <jmer> interop_madness: To a degree you are right but I guess that depends on HOW you define freedom :P
[16:17:17] <interop_madness> it's pretty much undefinable
[16:17:23] <interop_madness> like "beauty"
[16:17:23] <jmer> Nasp: The obvious drug users you see on the streets are the alcoholics, not the avg user.
[16:17:26] <Nasp> We are not a free society
[16:17:34] <Nasp> jmer:  Correct
[16:18:03] <Nasp> If people would just smoke it somewhere i don't have to smell it, then i wouldn't care
[16:18:32] <interop_madness> my take on social media is that the prominent examples like twitter should be outright forbidden and tens of billions should be invested into cracking down on anyone who makes any clone of it, whatever the cost for prosecution may be
[16:18:48] <Nasp> Why
[16:18:57] <Nasp> So give twitter monopoly or remove twitter as well?
[16:19:02] <Nasp> Isn't instagram much worse
[16:19:05] <jmer> I'm not a proponent of just letting the drugs flow... But it shouldn't be illegal, it should be sold from dispensaries with government oversight, quality assurance and easy access to addiction treatment
[16:19:08] <interop_madness> because I am 100% convinced twitter subverts every aspect of our societal fabric
[16:19:48] <jmer> brb
[16:20:28] <interop_madness> I don't know much about instagram, but everything that rewards discourse narrowing at scale should be destroyed at any cost
[16:20:43] <MatthiasVance> interop_madness: What about keeping Twitter but only allowing 1 account per entity (person or business)
[16:20:47] <MatthiasVance> With *real* name
[16:20:55] <MatthiasVance> :P
[16:21:34] <interop_madness> we maybe could keep it, if there were a law that every post comes with full address, link to photo of house, link to photo of person, private telephone number and email of person etc.
[16:21:43] <Nasp> I only have a twitter account, and i only subscribe to tech people :D

[18:02:30] <hseg> DateTime.Now()
[18:02:44] <MaNa2k> hseg, that will give me the timestamp of now, not start of the day
[18:03:12] <MaNa2k> i used to do some addsomethingsomething(-1) and then addsomethingsomething(1) then i used to get what i needed

[18:04:28] <xb0o2> I wouldn't mind helping hseg but to be completely honest I can't really be bothered to decipher such a cryptic example - it'd be helpful if you had something a bit more fleshed out :-)
[18:04:42] <xb0o2> Even if it's not a real example, just make something up
[18:04:50] <MaNa2k> biberu, why not?
[18:05:17] <biberu> MaNa2k: it makes your function undeterministic, and anything that calls it undeterministic

[18:15:16] <Nasp> And how large are these files
[18:15:18] <MaNa2k> i have storage queue, which gets file from erpA, the functionApp is triggered immidiately, read id in file and fetches rest of data from erpA, then porocesses date and transfers to erpB. But somethimes the data in erpA isnt ready, so in that case the file is not processed and transfered to erpB, which is why i have this nightly re-run of those files
[18:15:19] <JakeSays> i don't see the problem with that
[18:15:57] <MaNa2k> around 500bytes i think
[18:16:19] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: you should be storing the failed files in a re-processing queue
[18:16:20] <Nasp> Have you seen it happen?
[18:16:25] <MaNa2k> the files only contain some info about changes and id. i have to lookup the details

[18:24:37] <MaNa2k> yes maybe
[18:24:46] <MaNa2k> whats a workflow ?

[18:25:18] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  But if it never fails, why do you need to reprocess them
[18:25:18] <irwiss> Nasp: it's about as much rps as i got serving dummy test api requests on a $2.5/mo when running one of my tests, i'm just surprised someone decided to blog about it :P
[18:25:19] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, yes that right
[18:25:22] <Nasp> And do you jsut reprocess all
[18:25:32] <biberu> hseg: no, you have to add it on subclasses
[18:25:38] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: so when that human detects an error what do they do?
[18:25:40] <hseg> shame
[18:26:02] <biberu> hseg: not really, T might be something wider at the implementation site
[18:26:08] <Nasp> irwiss:  Like when we calculate our rps to request per server, we are down to like 4 or somewthing
[18:26:11] <Nasp> And it still struggles :D
[18:26:14] <JakeSays> Nasp: they do fail - they fail human validation

[18:26:55] <MaNa2k> the webhook notification is what we get in our queue
[18:26:59] <Nasp> Or was slow, and there for what happens
[18:27:08] <irwiss> Nasp: yeah i mean if you got logic involved or long runs it might start crapping out on low cost vms, but i mean, posting a blog about such numbers is weird af

[18:28:04] <Nasp> irwiss:  We had someone seeing our metrics at a convention because we needed to debug something "damn 100 rps"

[18:56:47] <Nasp> So you would rather keep a bad dev than throwing them out?
[18:56:51] <JakeSays> 14 days is barely long enough to get settled in
[18:57:08] <hseg> JakeSays: the refactor I'm trying to achieve is to generalize my classes so GetHoldingData can return either {Old,New}HoldingSchema

[18:57:30] <JakeSays> Nasp: a bad dev is someone who refuses to learn.
[18:57:37] <Nasp> Correct
[18:57:41] <hseg> so that I can slowly transition from the OldSchema to NewSchema
[18:57:56] <Nasp> But i am just saying if you hire a developer with 3 year old experience, that's more like a newly grad, then you are out
[18:58:06] <hseg> I'm not sure how I would do that without generics
[18:58:28] <JakeSays> Nasp: that's a myopic view, especially these days

[19:00:56] <hseg> that would require downcasting all places that use the old, though

[19:07:08] <JakeSays> hseg: well, actually i had it backward. you write a translator that converts new to old to keep the system running. then you refactor each of those 25 sites individually to use the new schema

[22:58:52] <ki9a> the second is always granted though
[22:59:05] <JakeSays> well i would hope so

[22:59:23] <ki9a> at X

[23:04:25] <MatthiasVance> When they have first designed a street of houses

[23:09:02] <ki9a> But I live near Amsterdam
[23:09:09] <ki9a> there's almost no empty space here at all
[23:09:14] <Sora> now if I were just to do this with parallel foreach that'd be something like 6000 threads spawned or w/e
[23:09:20] <Sora> and most of the threads are idle waiting
[23:09:22] <Sora> so it's not the best way
[23:09:36] <JakeSays> huh. i was going to be in amsterdam next month
[23:10:29] <JakeSays> Sora: i'm pretty sure p.foreach uses the thread pool
[23:10:33] <JakeSays> or can anyway
[23:11:06] <Sora> well this needs to scale to about 10,000 a second, perhaps not all on the same server/same program
[23:11:08] <Sora> but still
[23:11:34] <JakeSays> are these inbound requests?
[23:11:39] <Sora> outbound http
[23:11:43] <JakeSays> ah
[23:11:48] <Sora> most of them will time out
[23:12:08] <JakeSays> well, you'll never get enough outbound requests to swamp the cpu anyway
[23:12:16] <Sora> but no point having a thread sit idle here
[23:12:20] <Sora> while waiting for that timeout
[23:12:56] <Sora> so async requests are probably the way to go?
[23:12:57] <JakeSays> well, your async method could just invoke a callback upon completion
[23:13:07] <JakeSays> Sora: yeah
[23:14:28] <Sora> async method will still be waiting 60s

[23:41:06] <JakeSays> LOL ah ok. much better

[23:42:07] <ki9a> 23 x 33 feet
[23:42:35] <JakeSays> 7x10 feet three level would make for a luxury outhouse
[23:42:58] <Kim^J> ki9a: So 210 sqm, yeah that's fairly large =)
[23:43:14] <ki9a> the 3rd level is "attic" though
[23:43:21] <lz_> "Kohn in his book As We Know It wrote that the hand axe is "a highly visible indicator of fitness, and so becomes a criterion of mate choice" I'm lost on wikipedia again

[23:43:37] <ki9a> you could create 2 or 3 rooms there

[23:43:52] <ki9a> but it the a roof, so diagonal
[23:43:54] <JakeSays> ki9a: so that's 210sqm x 2'ish?
[23:43:56] <lz_> imagine that during prehistoric time, chicks would only bang you if you could make symmetric tools
[23:44:10] <JakeSays> 2.8'ish
[23:44:13] <lz_> not that it's any better today
[23:44:25] <ki9a> 140sqm
[23:44:38] <ki9a> not sure how to count the top floor
[23:44:54] <lz_> maybe in 2100 you can bang chicks if your code produces 0 exception
[23:45:28] <lz_> 1st tinder questions: "do you use tabs or spaces?"
[23:45:46] <ki9a> my code by default has 0 expected exceptions
[23:45:54] <lz_> ki9a: u so hot
[23:46:04] <ki9a> it has exceptions only when things go wrong
[23:46:22] <JakeSays> lz_: all ya have to do is ask nicely or pay
[23:48:39] <lz_> "I'm only looking for men who use strong typed languages sorry"
[23:49:23] <JakeSays> lz_: well, i wouldn't go near a weakly typed woman anyway
