[11:29:49] <the-cursed-one[m> ???????
[11:29:53] <the-cursed-one[m> im confused
[11:31:47] <fnutt> the-cursed-one[m: As you can see in the topic of this channel, #thelounge is not for chatting about every day life and other general stuff.
[11:32:10] <fnutt> #thelounge is a channel for development and support for The Lounge IRC Web Client.
[11:32:27] <the-cursed-one[m> you have link to off-topic room i thought this was it
[11:32:28] <fnutt> If you want to talk about the client itself, please go ahead.
[11:32:28] <the-cursed-one[m> ?
[11:32:47] <fnutt> If you just want to chat, I would recommend /join #chat
[11:33:13] <the-cursed-one[m> thank you
