[02:26:45] <splitongop> So ffmpeg.c is doing something that trims the audio track when using the concat filter. So that it doesn't exceed the video track. Any idea what that is? I thought about just getting the video length ahead of time and adding an atrim. but I dont see a reliable way to get the video duration from the ffapi.

[04:35:24] <splitongop> I tried that. I think windows 11 is just broken right now. I tried vmware workstation, VirtualBox (didnt even install in windows 11), hyper-v (didnt work). So now I'm trying on my WIndows 10 machine with virtual box and it keeps timeing out on download while making the image
[04:36:09] <splitongop> On my 3rd attempt on Windows 10 VirutalBox.  Seem like it got stuck at a different spot the first 2 times. so hopefully 3rd times the charm
[04:37:36] * pts333 thinks windows isnt a trustable os
[04:41:13] <pts333> can you even compile ffmpeg in windows?
[04:42:07] <pts333> i dont wanna know
[04:48:43] <splitongop> No dice.. Now it says Error: CliError { error: Some(failed to download from `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/ansi_term/0.11.0/download`
[04:49:36] <splitongop> Actually I've only ever had it worked when compiling on windows.. Maybe this VM stuff just doesnt work idk.. I think I used mysys or somethign like that before
[04:51:10] <splitongop> I thought the docker thing was neat though since it doesnt leave a mess on my machine.. I just cant keep it to work
[04:58:58] <BtbN> I'm literally using WSL to do that whole thing. On Windows 11. It works just fine.
[04:59:19] <BtbN> All you need is WSL and Docker
[05:01:04] <splitongop> I mean I can try again but it didnt work for me. It something about unauthorized when I tried to make a debug build. I may try it again after I just rebooted and trying Win10+VirtualBox+Ubuntu

[05:26:06] <BtbN> ?
[05:26:24] <BtbN> It's how you download that stuff. If you are really maschochistig, you can also roll it from scratch.
[05:26:30] <BtbN> But that'll take a couple days of fiddling
[05:27:01] <BtbN> You probably don't even need WSL or Linux at all, outside of Docker
[05:27:15] <BtbN> just docker and msys or whatever else has bash will probably work
[05:27:24] <BtbN> Docker + git for windows or something
[05:28:01] <splitongop> I mean it is rolling now so we will see how far this goes. I know the first time I did it. I tried to copy the files from the zip this time I used the file from where it was in windows
[05:28:21] <BtbN> copy files from the zip file?
[05:28:48] <splitongop> i extracted first then copied from windows into the linux file system

[06:07:09] <BtbN> What do you even want with a debug build of the 4.4 branch? That does not seem all that useful to me
[06:08:40] <splitongop18> Well this all started because I'm trying to figure out how ffmpeg.c handles concat. It seems to be trimming the audio stream to match the video stream.. I'm trying to implement that myself
[06:09:25] <BtbN> I don't think ffmpeg.c does anything that complex
[06:09:43] <splitongop18> I can add a atrim filter but I dont know how to get the duration of the video stream from the ffapi reliably
[06:10:03] <BtbN> You generally don't without decoding the whole thing and then checking
[06:11:14] <splitongop18> if I dont trim the audio stream.. I get no video for the next track. So it must be doing something special.. I'm using the same filter description idk

[06:12:16] <splitongop18> so if I use concat filter to combine video 1 and video2. I get a video that is video 1 then last frame of video 1 when video 1 ends and the audio track is the video 1 and video 2 like I want
[06:12:45] <splitongop18> in other words instead of showing video 2 video stream.. I get a still frame of video 1 last frame
[06:13:10] <splitongop18> if I add atrim on the first video it works properly because the audio stream of video 1 is slightly longer than the video stream

[20:36:25] <SuRGeoNix> Hi, I think I come across with another ffmpeg bug with http/hls demuxer. In case of slow network connection it will skip some segments. Tested also with ffplay / mpv. Any idea about it, should I open it in trac?

[20:42:41] <Bombo> hi
[20:43:09] <Bombo> can ffmpeg decode/encode bink2?
[20:43:23] <JEEB> Bombo: there's an initial patch set but it's not complete, there are still some artifacts
[20:43:38] <JEEB> for decoding, that is
[20:43:40] *** Joins: kib (~kib@user/kib)
[20:43:57] <JEEB> there's like X different versions of bink2 as well, which makes it "fun"
[20:44:04] <Bombo> JEEB: ok
[20:45:31] <Bombo> i just got a game here with 1920 x 1080 .bk2 that plays with 17fps, i thought i could recode it ;)
[20:47:41] <JEEB> SuRGeoNix: if you can make a somewhat reproducible thing, possibly :P although with a live stream if a segment is no longer available then it's no longer available?
[20:48:06] <JEEB> not sure what that error actually means, but that's what I usually feel like happens when connection goes bad
[20:48:49] <SuRGeoNix> Yes, I was finally able to find a way to reproduce it with bandwidth limiter to 5-10KB/s for (not live) http://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mp4/playlist.m3u8 sample
[20:49:28] <SuRGeoNix> I've seen a lot of issues by searching for that error unresolved out there
[20:49:58] <SuRGeoNix> Not sure if that helps but with max offset debug i got also those before the above error

[21:34:46] <SuRGeoNix> JEEB it happens also with rtsp... not sure if this is an issue with the mpegts or with both hls/rtsp?
[21:35:05] <JEEB> rtsp should be quite different in stack
[21:35:17] <JEEB> there's no MPEG-TS etc, defaults to RTP over UDP
[21:35:26] <JEEB> (you can set it to RTP over TCP as well, of course)
[21:38:08] <SuRGeoNix> rtsp uses mpegts rigth?
[21:40:46] <JEEB> no?
[21:41:16] <JEEB> RTSP is a thing where you get an SDP manifest from somewhere, which says that you have RTP streams in locations X and Y
[21:41:23] <JEEB> usually one for audio, one for video
[21:41:33] <JEEB> technically you can have MPEG-TS over RTP, but definitely not the default thing
[21:47:35] <SuRGeoNix> No familiar with those I was just looking https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/rtsp.c which refers to avpriv_mpegts_parse_packet
[21:49:36] <JEEB> SuRGeoNix: yea that gets specifically utilized if the SDP manifest says the input RTP is MPEG-TS
[21:49:48] <JEEB> but I would say that is not the usual thing for RT(S)P :)
[21:50:06] <SuRGeoNix> what about his one? :P  rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov
[21:50:26] <SuRGeoNix> Just to make sure that the issue is at the underlying demuxer
[21:50:53] <JEEB> it dumps the SDP for you if you do -v verbose
[21:51:10] <JEEB> I see rtpmap 96 and 97
[21:51:13] <JEEB> so AAC and H.264
[21:51:17] <JEEB> no mpeg-ts in tehre
[21:53:15] <SuRGeoNix> Just wondering then... what are the possibilities that the same issue would exist on both rtsp and hls
[21:53:49] *** Quits: gnoo_ (~gnoo@user/gnoo) (Quit: gnoo_)
[21:53:53] <JEEB> loldunno, with RTP it's a live UDP stream so if your bandwidth drops you're going to get derped even though the original file is VOD
[21:54:10] <JEEB> but can't say anything without context really
[21:54:24] <SuRGeoNix> I had tested with TCP as well
[21:54:36] <SuRGeoNix> Anyway, I will open this on trac as I can't mess with it more right now and we see, thanks for one more time ;)
