[14:59:24] <Guest40> hmm can't find anything in the docs, how are they different from normal LV components?
[15:00:18] <Nicd> function components
[15:00:26] <Nicd> e.g. you just have a function in a module
[15:00:38] <Nicd> you call it with `<Module.function ... />`
[15:01:37] <Nicd> https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.Component.html#content
[15:02:07] <Nicd> as opposed to module components (LiveComponents) that are a whole module and have a function called render
[15:03:26] <serafeim> Nicd: so this is just calling a function from inside the template. i.e instead of `<Module.function x=3 y=4>` I could just do a `<%= Module.function(3, 4) %>` ? 
[15:04:04] <Nicd> not sure how the diff tracking would deal with the latter case
[15:05:39] <serafeim> i presume if you change the assigns it should be the same ? 
[15:06:25] <Nicd> I don't know the internals of the diff system
[15:06:34] <Nicd> it's a lot of macro magic and I wouldn't make assumptions about it
[15:06:39] <serafeim> ok

[15:08:39] <Guest40> oh sweet, yeah didn't know about that, very cool
[15:10:32] <Nicd> for example for some reason I can use `assigns[somethingsomething]` without losing diff tracking even though the docs say not to do this. so I got by testing and not by assumption when it comes to LV diffs :P
[15:10:40] <Nicd> go by testing*
[15:11:07] <serafeim> Nicd: going by testing is not good
[15:11:22] <serafeim> because what works now by testing may not work in next version
[15:11:29] <Nicd> it's better than assuming
[15:11:38] <serafeim> yes
[15:11:47] <serafeim> but works than relying to docs :)
[15:11:51] <serafeim> worse 
[15:12:56] <Nicd> sadly the docs tell me not to use `assigns[somethingsomething]` which I need to use, so for that part the docs can stuff it since it works anyway :D
[15:13:04] <serafeim> ok

[19:13:37] <Guest40> Does put_root_layout work with .heex templates? I copied a root .leex template from an old project to a new v1.6 project, root.html.heex worked fine but the .leex template couldn't find app.js. Apparently the static path to it had changed, so i updated the file, but now i get a "Websocket is closed" warning in the browser console and the loading

[19:18:35] <Poeticode> Nicd sweet that was easier than expected
[19:19:05] <Nicd> Guest40: if it renders the root layout then the put_root_layout worked, the JS stuff is another issue then
