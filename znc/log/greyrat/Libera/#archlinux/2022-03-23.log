[05:20:33] <Edu4rdSHL> It's minimalism.
[05:21:40] <openfbtd> I'm not going to have a debate on what exactly minimalism means, I'll just offer an example of what would a minimalist distro be instead
[05:21:44] <openfbtd> Alpine Linux

[05:24:35] <thrice> and the "recommends" that can be omitted, if desired, without breaking core functionality
[05:24:38] <jonathon> or, does the number of packages in debian mean it's bloated? ;P

[05:39:11] <openfbtd> thrice, having a tendency to solve common problems with the least complex tools available is a pretty decent definition of having minimalist tendencies IMO 🤷
[05:39:17] <cedb> im glad we could all agree that a given term was meaningless

[05:40:48] <openfbtd> I mean that's just aesthetic miminalism, but sure, it's a part of this.
[05:40:52] <jonathon> there's definitely a cargo cult-like approach to things, "this uses more RAM, it's bad" without asking why it uses more ram

[05:42:12] <cedb> jonathon: it is good to the extent that it saves you time trying to figure out exactly what you need
[05:42:38] <Edu4rdSHL> openfbtd, you should use a better browser, even chrome with 150 tabs open here doesn't use that amount of RAM

[05:43:35] <openfbtd> Yeah that happens every time someone with complex tasks describes their system. The clue is in “most of that does someothing” Edu4rdSHL. I know what the browser does, I'm fine with it.
[05:43:37] <jonathon> Windows changing Solitaire from like 300KB to some 1GB WCF nightmare is bloat
[05:43:53] <cedb> does it raytrace though?
[05:43:55] <openfbtd> I just have some tabs that need to be open but also run fairly heavy tasks 🤷

[12:05:30] <bparker> none of these solutions solve glibc versioning issues, either

[12:05:34] <noobaroo> phaise, specific library versions... Thats a good benefit right? Does that mean that snap has to keep entire gcc libraries and such for each individual snap package?

[16:54:10] <mizu> today i updated my system and matlab stopped worked due to some symbol error in the libcairo.so. so i downgraded thr cairo package to the last version before the update and matlab is working fine again. am i in for any unwarranted issues by doing this?

[16:55:04] <mpan> mizu: yes, that’s a partial upgrade. All packages depending on libcairo expect it to be in the current version.
[16:55:20] <lb9di> upgrade matlab instead, or stuff it in some kind of sandbox

[16:56:47] <mizu> i see. there is a new matlab update. i will try that and see if the issue with cairo persists.

[22:12:52] <Mete-> Good day everyone, is it possible to somehow make sound goes through a usb connected headset for zoom and other software but everything else uses the jack output? If yes, what should I look for?

[22:14:45] <thurstylark> also, yes, totally possible, just gotta find the right instructions :P
[22:15:05] <Mete-> thurstylark, sorry but what do you mean by sound system?
[22:15:26] <jonathon> pavucontrol will let you set output per application, and Zoom's settings also let you pick a specific output device
[22:15:28] <thurstylark> pulseaudio, alsa, pipewire, jack, etc
[22:15:54] <Mete-> thurstylark, oh yeah, I think this is part of the question too
[22:16:20] <Mete-> jonathon, nice, I use pavu control for audio on hdmi, didn't even thought about it!
[22:16:53] <thurstylark> ahh, yeah, if you're using pavucontrol already, then you're using either pulse or pipewire with pipewire-pulse
[22:17:11] <Mete-> so its pulseaudio
[22:17:12] *** Joins: ivii (~ivan@user/ivii)
[22:17:20] <Mete-> I don't have pipewire here, any reason to install it?
[22:17:30] <DilithiumNO3> pavucontrol is mainly for Pulseaudio but it's pretty capable of controlling Pipewire

[22:18:45] <thurstylark> Mete-: unless you need something specific that pulse can't do, then the only reason to switch now is to be ahead of the curve
[22:18:45] <Mete-> perfect, I think thats it! Thanks for the help jonathon, thurstylark and DilithiumNO3 
[22:18:51] <DilithiumNO3> Pipewire is way more plug and play, has lower latencies, can also handle video including screen capture (helpful for Wayland), and can replace JACK if you work with audio on that level
[22:19:10] <thurstylark> pipewire will eventually usurp pulse, but both are still valid at the moment :)

[22:19:20] <Mete-> I don't think I want to mess with it now, I had issues making sound work on this notebook in the past
[22:19:28] <DilithiumNO3> and EasyEffects (formerly PulseEffects) only supports Pipewire AFAIK
[22:19:32] <Mete-> but in case I want to use pipewire, should I uninstall pulse?
[22:19:42] <DilithiumNO3> yes, replace with pipewire-pulse
[22:19:51] <Mete-> do I still need alsa?
[22:20:14] <Mete-> I also have that sof-firmware package installed, but I guess thats something else?
[22:20:35] <thurstylark> yeah, that's hardware stuff. that's still necessary regardless of which one you're using
[22:20:42] <Mete-> alright, perfect
[22:20:48] <DilithiumNO3> ALSA is kinda part of the kernel
