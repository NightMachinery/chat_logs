[00:50:29] <pe> Ah, string comparison.
[00:51:46] <pe> Useless manpage, useless docs.
[00:52:21] <pe> Today, on I'll Tell You Why X Sucks balls, we discuss Meson.
[00:52:25] <drobilla> If the builtin build types don't work for you, use plain builds and set env vars
[00:53:14] <drobilla> Meson has its extremely opinionated BSDM way about some things, and fighting it is a losing battle
[00:55:01] <drobilla> As a dev that cares about such things, you'll inevitably end up doing this (or -Dc_args or whatever instead) anyway.  Don't bother trying to make meson agree with you on what "debug" does or whatever
[00:56:43] <pe> Meson has a BDSM way, sure.
[00:56:57] <drobilla> To be fair they hit the mark pretty well on some things WRT not providing people the power to make shitty weird inconsistent build systems with it, but it goes off the rails sometimes
[00:57:19] <pe> I can admit that.
[00:57:32] <pe> > The value of b_sanitize can be one of: none, address, thread, undefined, memory, address,undefined
[00:57:34] <pe> Only one?
[00:57:50] <drobilla> and a few things are just fucking embarrassing.  Like, the convention is to name your build directory "builddir", not build, because it occupies the same place in the command.  Which means directory names on the filesystem are mashed into the same namespace as "setup" and "configure" and such
[00:57:54] <drobilla> Which..... just wow
[00:57:56] * pe goes to the woods to die
[00:58:47] <drobilla> i.e. "meson detup" will configure a new build directory called "detup".
[00:59:42] <drobilla> I imagine this will get fixed at the expense of back compat (it's confusing anyway), but if we're complaining, that's my favourite

[04:57:40] <jjuran> I use exceptions in some places, but I've been starting to migrate away from them
[04:59:23] <companion_cube> do you use out parameters, and have functions return a boolean to indicate errors? this kind of stuff?
[05:03:27] <jjuran> No, I'm working on a dynamic object library that uses a discriminated union, which extends my existing string class.  The idea is you return an object which is either a valid result or an error.
[05:03:49] <companion_cube> right
[05:03:57] <companion_cube> you have a custom discriminated union?
[05:04:07] <jjuran> Working on it, but yeah
[05:05:01] <jjuran> Technically, the string class already counts, since it has a small object optimization.  The last byte determines (a) whether the string is allocated or inline, and if the latter, (b) the length.

[17:40:24] <pushcx> Oh, and for anyone reading the modlog this morning: usually I disable invites when I see clumps of bad actors like VoiceOfIvana, but I looked up the emails for the couple users she invited and they were all in various marketing roles.
[17:40:41] <pushcx> riv: the value came from our config, but the loading order is bizarre
[17:40:54] <pushcx> c355E3B: Cool, have a good conference, and let me know when you can. :)
[17:41:33] <c355E3B> The "easy" fix is to move over to Rails Yaml based config, because it no longer requires Zeitwerk to behave properly to get the correct value.
[17:42:25] <pushcx> I figured it would be zeitwerk, that was the culprit for like other loading bugs. :| In Zeitwerk's defense we were also doing clever things there, too.
[17:42:38] <pushcx> *like three other
[17:43:05] <c355E3B> We have an old rails application and whenever there are loader changes things go south
[17:43:12] <c355E3B> I remember doing rails 2 to rails 3 and adding in spring

[17:45:59] <pushcx> Oh, also with VoiceOfIvana, her coworker sisyphus sent me a real indignant message about how retool wasn't spamming us... and then she submitted the 'top 5 mysql tools for 2021'. Pissing on my leg and telling me it's not raining is not an effective way to convince me of one's good faith.
[17:55:39] <pja> pushcx: That’s amazing.

[20:45:07] <feoh> OK I super duper big <3 that Pycharm article. So much IDE shaming out there. Super refreshing to see someone take the time to write a fact based piece on how and why an actual IDE really accelerates his personal development velocity.
[20:45:46] <technomancy> I think a lot of the IDE hate comes from working on codebases that get so complex they're impossible to use without an IDE, particularly in Java
[20:46:18] <technomancy> you won't see a lot of IDE hate in the racket community for instance
[20:46:57] <feoh> Actually the little I've seen of Racket it seems to me its default development environment embodies a ton of IDE like features
[20:47:02] <feoh> So less need of one
[20:47:22] <technomancy> no, the default environment *is* an IDE
[20:47:46] <riv> ive been getting into using an IDE (vscode) for the first time
[20:47:48] <technomancy> it's just that unlike Java, using an IDE in racket doesn't result in code that's incomprehensible to non-IDE users
[20:47:55] <feoh> Yes that's what I was struggling towards. Exactly.
[20:48:09] <feoh> I'd argue that the issue there is Java
[20:48:35] <feoh> the tooling grew out of a need to overcome the boiler plate sprawl the language and its ecosystem create
[20:48:43] <feoh> Interestingly I'm seeing some pushback of late from the ecosystem side
[20:48:44] <technomancy> it's unsurprising that people resent *having* to use an IDE
[20:49:26] <feoh> I get that. it's just unfortunate that they tar every IDE and every individiaul's choice to use an IDE with that same broad negativity brush. I think it hurts people.
[20:49:37] *** Quits: aman (~aman@user/aman) (Quit: aman)
[20:50:27] <feoh> And actually your point about Racket is an excellent one. Both language and default programming environment are hyper-optimized for programmer productivity
[20:50:52] <feoh> The tooling and the ecosystem don't need to over-evolve to overcome design warts inherent in the philosophy

[20:51:47] <feoh> This whole "Work" concept is such a pain :)
[20:52:33] <companion_cube> this I can agree on
[20:52:54] <companion_cube> I think IDEs are also designed for programmer productivity
[20:53:01] <companion_cube> but in a large team setting :)
[20:53:11] <feoh> Depends on the language and the IDE

[20:54:01] <technomancy> meanwhile smalltalk people are rolling their eyes hard
[20:54:11] <companion_cube> they can roll their eyes hard if they want
[20:54:18] <companion_cube> but they failed at collaboration as well
[20:54:33] <companion_cube> who wants to work in opaque binary images?
[20:54:33] <feoh> Because I can painlessly do complex refactors, run tests, track down failures, and do things like pop into a REPL to explore what's going wrong when a data structure doesn't match reality from in the middle of a debugging session. All these things are possible but NOT easy IMO without an IDE.
[20:54:35] <feoh> Indeed!@
[20:54:37] <companion_cube> how do you VCS?
[20:54:56] <companion_cube> image based languages are solipstic :p
[20:54:58] <companion_cube> change my mind
[20:55:32] <technomancy> the other part of the problem is that "IDE" is really poorly defined; a lot of people say Emacs isn't an IDE and then when you ask them what makes something an IDE they list a bunch of features Emacs has, but since Emacs runs in a terminal or something, it can't count?
[20:55:33] <feoh> All true, and everyone I've talked to who's actually used Smalltalk in an actual working environment says that dealing with the large images and build/load/save times gets P-A-I-N-F-U-L and the cycle times become crazy slow as a result
[20:56:03] *** Quits: rodolphoeck (~rodolphoe@user/rodolphoeck) (Quit: brb)
[20:56:38] <companion_cube> technomancy: emacs with LSP might be an IDE :)
[20:56:44] <companion_cube> without LSP? fuck no
[20:56:53] <feoh> Totally agree. If your emacs has automations in place that enable you to do the kinds of things a more special purpose IDE can, and I know many exist, then good on you. But I'd argue that a lot of people get cowed by all the IDE hate into running very minimal environments that DON'T have these features, and so they either don't refactor or they try
[20:56:53] <feoh> and do it badly/incompletely
[20:57:03] <technomancy> companion_cube: lmao wat
[20:57:14] <technomancy> companion_cube: everything LSP offers is already implemented in Emacs
[20:57:18] <companion_cube> it's not an IDE if it's not integrated with your language
[20:57:31] <technomancy> just not with as wide of a language coverage
[20:57:34] <companion_cube> well, I say LSP, but if you have an equivalent with custom protocols, sure
[20:57:40] <technomancy> SLIME has features LSP could only ever dream of
[20:58:23] <feoh> That's what I was just going to say, whether emacs has or doesn't have a given feature in its own 'native' non LSP ecosystem is HIGHLY dependent on which language we're talking. LISP dialects? Absolutely. Something else? It Depends.
[20:58:51] <companion_cube> technomancy: heh, sure, it's the poster child of emacs integration
[20:59:09] <companion_cube> but it's also for a language where IDEs won't be able to do as much as for other languages
[20:59:12] <feoh> Also I can't run emacs as a daily driver because it's like crack cocaine and I end up ruining myself endlessly toying with configuration options, extra elisp packages, Helm extensions and down the infinite rabbit hole I go. Goodbye productivity :)
[20:59:19] <technomancy> companion_cube: tell me how SLIME isn't an IDE
[20:59:30] <technomancy> what possible definition of IDE could you make which excludes SLIME?
[20:59:32] <feoh> IMO SLIME is absolutely an IDE.
[20:59:32] <companion_cube> I'm sure it is
[20:59:54] <companion_cube> I'm just protesting to "does things LSP could only ever dream of"
[21:00:01] <companion_cube> that's true, but it also goes the other way
[21:00:07] <technomancy> feoh: I have a friend who switched to vim specifically because vimscript is terrible, and to him that's a feature
[21:00:13] <companion_cube> I mean, not for lisp. I'm ready to accept SLIME is the best lisp IDE :)
[21:00:25] <feoh> Ha! I feel that.
[21:00:26] <technomancy> for common lisp anyway, sure
[21:01:08] <companion_cube> tell your friend to switch back to neovim :-°
[21:01:57] <feoh> That was me actually. I switched to Vim but then switched to VSCode with Vim extension (the emulation is VERY good) because I keep the same editing productivity, get a bunch of syntax highlighting and the like etc. It's my *editor* of choice for most things, but I use an IDE for most actual programming of any substance. Whatever IDE-like tool makes
[21:01:57] <feoh> sense for the programming language I'm using :)
[21:02:35] <feoh> neovim is neat but I fear it will always kinda languish and it'll never reach its full potential.
[21:03:48] <companion_cube> it's pretty active though

[21:05:07] <companion_cube> still, there are also a lot of benefits

[21:16:18] <feoh> That's what I mean. it's under active development for sure, but it's so ambitious in a few respects that there are a bunch of rough edges hampering adoption

[21:22:25] <brennen> yeah, i haven't used an IDE i cared for since approximately the era of qbasic and hypercard, but the few times i've had to dig into java, it's pretty clear that not using one is hopeless.
[21:22:50] <indigo> I like the combo of dumb text editor + good code search (like Sourcegraph)
[21:22:54] <technomancy> zerobrane is also an excellent IDE
[21:22:54] <dimadima> just the auto imports, the completions, the refactors and renames and moves etc

[21:23:29] <dimadima> cool a Lua IDDE
[21:23:48] <indigo> Ah, Lua... such an underrated language :)
[21:24:08] <iDrougge> If you can assume that users are using an IDE or at least an LSP enabled editor, you can also design your language to take advantage of that.
[21:24:24] <dimadima> anything in praticular comes to mind that you like about lua indigo ?
[21:24:26] <iDrougge> One can clearly see that C's IDE was a typewriter.
[21:24:48] <dimadima> heh iDrougge
[21:25:06] <companion_cube> iDrougge: yeah, agreed
[21:25:10] <dimadima> that's got to be a movement; "my IDE is a typewriter"
[21:25:14] <brennen> i remain unconvinced that tightly coupling the ability to comprehend and modify code to a specific client/environment works out well in practice.
[21:25:17] <dimadima> tshirt, mug
[21:25:18] <companion_cube> but that also includes not having a crazy syntax
[21:25:20] <brennen> then again, i liked hypercard, so who knows.

[21:26:03] <technomancy> programming languages should be designed for human brains, not github fuckin' copilot
[21:26:06] <iDrougge> C's syntax only seems normal because a lot of languages look like C nowadays.

[21:27:20] <iDrougge> If you can assume that programs will be written in an editor with some kind of auto completion, you don't need to optimise (pessimise) your language to use single-letter identifiers or even six-letter ones.
[21:27:25] <dimadima> i've written like 5 lines of lua for some macos automation
[21:27:30] <indigo> Java is still not great :P way too easy to fall into the trap of over design-patterning things
[21:27:49] <dimadima> indigo: ppl do that still?
[21:27:59] <indigo> Lol... yes
[21:28:12] <dimadima> gah

[21:28:35] <dimadima> there's your pattern, do that :)
[21:28:50] <dimadima> call them all "Controller"
[21:28:58] <indigo> It's not necessarily inheritance vs. composition, but also lots of indirection (eg. visitor pattern, etc)
[21:29:03] <dimadima> sprinkle a Supplier and a Builder
[21:29:17] <dimadima> yeah visitor patterns needs to be banned
[21:29:56] <dimadima> ppl should all accept that the visitor was a bad solution to a language shortcoming (lack of matching) in the language, just use instanceof and call it a day until java gets there
[21:30:13] *** raj_ is now known as raj
[21:30:14] <dimadima> and it's pretty close at this point?
[21:30:29] <iDrougge> Just don't use Java. Problem solved.
[21:31:03] <technomancy> I'm still not sure I buy the argument that "design patterns are just gaps in language design where they left shit out" but it's a lot more agreeable than "design patterns are like pokémons and you gotta catch em all"
[21:31:17] <iDrougge> I had to review some Kotlin code yesterday and it was looking fine until some inline class monstrosities showed up that were purely due to the surrounding environment being Java.

[21:36:28] <technomancy> I think Lua might be another thing where people hate it for bad reasons. like if you only spend a day or two using it you will make all these mistakes due to 1-indexing but once you actually learn the language it doesn't cause any problems, but a lot of people don't get there and it just leaves a bad taste in their mouth.
[21:38:25] <iDrougge> I can understand hating a language for 0-indexing or 2-indexing, but 1-indexing should be naturally understandable to most people from western cultures, at least.

[21:41:08] <technomancy> companion_cube: IME the 1-indexing is the most likely to be complained about by a large margin
[21:41:34] <technomancy> kind of like people who never used lisp are like "omg parens; you moved them from one side of the identifier to the other how dare you"
[21:42:16] <companion_cube> I can imagine getting over the 1 indexing yeah

[23:14:45] <JordiGH> Sigh, it's an embarrassment.
[23:15:17] <JordiGH> I'm so disillusioned with GNU. They should have led by deeds, not words, like they were doing at the beginning.
[23:15:44] <JordiGH> You want more free software, then spend all of your efforts on building a great place to host it.
[23:16:04] <JordiGH> You can still dress up as a gnu and wiggle your butt in front of an Apple store, but only with the budget that's left over.
[23:16:25] <imode> activism in software is rarely led by deeds.
[23:16:33] <imode> because we all eventually have to make money.
[23:16:53] <JordiGH> It was in the beginning. The whole reason everyone was using GNU software to the point that "GNU/Linux" reasonably made sense is because the software *was* good.
[23:17:09] <JordiGH> And because Linux really couldn't get off the ground without GNU.
[23:17:47] <JordiGH> But after Brian Fox made bash and gcc could compile almost everything, GNU stopped paying people to make software.
[23:17:54] <JordiGH> RMS is such an ineffective leader.

[23:33:43] <cb> i decided not to waste my time anymore and just use MSVC for windows builds

[23:33:49] <cb> i have a dim view of cross-compilattion anyways
[23:33:50] <gwozniak> It's not hard to cross-compile with either of GCC or LLVM, tbh
[23:33:58] <technomancy> piece of cake
[23:34:09] <cb> LLVM is easier bc it can support multiple triplets from a single binary
[23:34:24] <gwozniak> cb: cross-compilation is a necessity for me
[23:34:42] <cb> yeah, you can't avoid it for embedded
[23:34:43] <gwozniak> I do prefer the Clang/LLVM thing of one binary for different toolchains
[23:35:03] <cb> but you can for systems tthat have enough locomotion
[23:35:10] <feoh> I'd also think cross compilation would be critical path for bootstrapping new platforms
[23:35:13] <cb> and IME cross-compiled means "i don't test my shit"
[23:35:29] <feoh> I remember reading years ago about how they used Green Hills C to cross compile the original Amiga OS.
[23:36:01] <imode> _miscompilations_?
[23:36:06] <imode> now you got me curious.
[23:36:37] <cb> imode: -O0 and -O3 binaries wouldn't work, -O2 did
[23:36:37] <iDrougge> I think, in particular, graphics.library was very dependent on Green Hills and difficult to port to other compilers.
[23:37:02] <imode> what the fuck.
[23:37:19] <JordiGH> Green Hills? Like Sonic the Hedgehog?
[23:37:21] <gwozniak> imode: I deal in miscompilations.  They happen
[23:37:26] <riv> goldilocks zone
[23:38:00] <imode> gwozniak: yeah but like... that's kind of nuts for an aged toolchain.

[23:38:27] <imode> my old mentor worked there.
[23:38:32] <imode> neat dude.
[23:39:45] <gwozniak> imode: it happens on less popular architectures whose machine descriptions may not be great
[23:40:13] <imode> yeah I figured. the less people touch your stuff.
[23:41:04] <feoh> If you google Amiga Green Hills C there's a bunch of ephemera out there but most of it's on message boards and the like
[23:42:03] <JordiGH> iDrougge: I still want to believe they're Sonic fans.
[23:42:33] <imode> tbf you want "gotta go fast" as a slogan for a compiler.
[23:43:33] <iDrougge> JordiGH: They were founded founded in the early 80s, before Sonic even existed on paper.
[23:43:44] <JordiGH> iDrougge: Why must you ruin my fun
[23:44:09] <iDrougge> Is your conviction strong enough?
[23:44:44] <gwozniak> Cross compilation itself is not difficult. It's the system headers that are the nightmare
[23:45:08] <iDrougge> Why is that? They can’t run software or anything like that, can they?
[23:48:25] <gwozniak> iDrougge: are you asking me? (just not sure)
[23:48:56] <iDrougge> Yes.
[23:50:49] <gwozniak> Targetting a compiler to build for another platform isn't hard (aside from knowing the magic "triple" you need), but you have to make sure you have precise headers for the platform or the generated code will be subtlely wrong.  Then there's all the '-B' and '--sysroot' options you have to pass so the compiler can find them
[23:51:57] <gwozniak> And there's a bit of a circular dependency.  The compiler (well, GCC, anyway) needs the headers in order to build the compiler in some cases, because it influence things like "how large is an int" and so forth
[23:52:03] <iDrougge> But isn’t that just a matter of supplying the correct path to the includes?
[23:52:33] <gwozniak> Yes.  But if the system, say, doesn't have headers already, it's quite a lot of work
[23:53:22] <iDrougge> A totally new system?
[23:53:27] <gwozniak> You also have to know all the options to turn off all the stuff the compiler does for you, normally -nostdlib and such
[23:54:01] <gwozniak> Yeah, it happens on embedded sometimes.  We often have to tweak libc headers (we only ever need libc)
[23:55:16] <gwozniak> If anyone is curious, run 'gcc -E -dM - </dev/null' to see all the built-in macros, some of which are defined via the system headers
