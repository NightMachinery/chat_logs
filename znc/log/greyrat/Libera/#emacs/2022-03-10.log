[00:49:55] <artefact> do they both have the same init.el?
[00:50:02] <artefact> emacs/packages versions?
[00:50:13] <markofcorn> I know PGTK build has a few issues, could that be the cause of this?
[00:50:20] <artefact> yes exwm is b0rked on pgtk
[00:50:42] <artefact> but when i tried it by mistake, it at least displayed a frame, no segfault
[00:50:45] <markofcorn> Yep same init.el, same compilation flags, same versions
[00:51:35] <markofcorn> Right it works on one machine on PGTK (and it worked on the other one as well before today). What issues does PGTK have anyway, and what should I switch to, lucid?
[00:52:14] <artefact> it didn't work at all for me. the frame wouldn't fill the entire screen, i was not able to switch between workspaces, exwm input map did not work at all
[00:53:05] <artefact> see https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/issues/860
[00:54:04] <artefact> the gist is that pgtk is only really for wayland

[01:57:27] <Zambyte> Hi, I am having trouble forcing a file link I am inserting in org-mode to be inserted as a relative link. When I use C-c C-l my file link is absolute. I saw some posts online suggesting doing C-u C-c C-l, but that is still inserting as absolute for me. According to the help for the org-insert-link function, it seems like C-u C-c C-l does the same "adaptive" behavior as is default for C-c C-l. Does anyone
[01:57:33] <Zambyte> know how I can insert a relative link in org-mode without changing the org-link-file-path-type variable to always insert relative links globally? Could I set that variable within a certain org document? Or can I use C-u C-c C-l in a way that will always be a relative link?

[03:12:23] <edrx> I knew that the chance of this working well was minimal so I mainly recycled material from previous workshops and created a page with explanations, links, and pointing to several 30s snippets that could be interesting.
[03:12:35] <edrx> bpalmer: I'll answer that soon!
[03:14:54] <edrx> a quick link to people who don't have any idea of I'm talking about: one of the 30s snippets was the one that third thumnail here - http://angg.twu.net/eev-find-angg.html - points to, and that shows that we can run "executable notes" without even having to download them, and mentioning maxima

[03:20:32] <edrx> they were very busy completely overwhelmed by tons of information, and trying to learn everything by themselves
[03:20:56] <edrx> but

And finding documentation has a similar problem, might as well automate that as well. And then we'd just have Eff Ess Bot but worse, and I'd be out a job again
[03:47:56] <edrx> and that they should think on how they would like to be treated by their colleagues when they show them a program that they are working on and that they need to see which parts are easy to use, which ones are not, where the docs need to be rewritten, which features are missing etc.

[11:03:29] <wasamasa> ;; `regexp' matches definitions using known forms like `defun', or `defvar'. But some functions/variables are defined using special macros (or functions), so if `regexp' can't find the definition, we look for something of the form "(SOMETHING <symbol> ...)". This fails to distinguish function definitions from variable declarations (or even uses thereof), but is a good pragmatic fallback.
[11:04:42] <wasamasa> if you evaluate that fallback code, it jumps to the defgroup

It can detect and allow the user to recover from a blocked subprocess (perhaps it is awaiting input for credentials or something). It actually checks major package versions. etc.

[13:08:20] <nnnnn> pkal: One thing I'm aiming for is making my manager much easier to extend than straight.el. Straight has a complicated bootstrapping process which I still don't quite understand after a year of working on it. Mine is much simpler and can already install external packages which modify it.
[13:08:31] <parsnip> actually i kind of want an all white bike now, like everything possible is white, rims, etc, just so i can tell if it's dirty or not

[15:19:13] <wasamasa> emacs itself is big enough as is
[15:19:24] <wasamasa> it ships with many modes out of the box, but nothing third-party
[15:19:44] <wasamasa> it doesn't make it as easy as possible to install third party stuff unaffiliated with the GNU project
[15:19:53] <wasamasa> on top of that there is a culture of customization

[16:24:30] <wasamasa> you could write up something with a process filter that keeps calling `write-region' with the chunk
[16:24:46] <bosonbear> after I write to the buffer I need to save it by hand right? any way to save the buffer automatically?
[16:25:43] <wasamasa> oh wait
[16:25:46] <wasamasa> call-process is synchronous

[16:28:19] <bosonbear> Okay then. Seems write-region is a good option. Just to be clear -- the logic of write-region is to "contain" the output into a variable, then write this variable into a file, correct? If so, that leads to a follow up Q: how do I collect the output of make-process into a variable in the first place?

[16:29:05] <pkal> What do you mean by contain?
[16:29:27] <pkal> write-region can write a region of a buffer or a string to a file
[16:30:34] <bosonbear> I mean the way to write-region that I'm familiar with is (write-region varialbe-a filename). Then I need to first save the output from make-process into my "variable-a". How do I achieve that?
[16:31:06] <pkal> If it has to be async, create a new buffer, call a process and redirect the output to that buffer, set a sentinel on that process to wait for it to terminate, and when that happens, use write-region to save the buffer contents and delete the buffer
[16:32:01] <pkal> bosonbear: Well no, it is (write-region string nil filename) or (write-region start-point end-point filename)

[20:18:46] <bpalmer> I'm not saying matlab and octave are the future of programming, but...
[20:18:56] <talismanick> I actually mentioned wanting an Emacs "pop up cheatsheet" template earlier to make myself a Rosetta stone for APL and BQN, the former being the source of all this trouble
[20:19:47] <bpalmer> Interesting; I don't think I had seen BQN before.
[20:19:57] <grym> bpalmer: any language that cannot represent ranks less than 2 is not worth consideration :D
[20:20:19] <talismanick> (APL is little-known now beyond "lol weird symbols, 1 line Game of Life", but its multidimensional array programming model, known as rank polymorphism, is now quite pervasive throughout scientific computing - see NumPy, Matlab, Fortran 90, etc)
[20:20:36] <talismanick> (APL started out as Iverson's alternative to Einstein notation)
[20:20:59] <grym> talismanick: i'm pretty sure APL postdates what became BLAS, slightly
[20:21:08] <grym> not by much though
[20:21:25] <wickedjargon> I am looking for a recommendation. I use print statements in python for debugging. For example, I'll highlight a variable name say, `x_cord`, open a new line, paste it, and wrap it with a print like this: `print('x_cord ->', x_cord)`
[20:21:45] <talismanick> grym: But isn't (or wasn't) BLAS a hodgepodge of Fortran 66 arithmetic ifs and gotos?
[20:22:02] <talismanick> Fortran won the battle, but lost the war - nowadays, we all think in APL, whether we like to admit it or not
[20:22:02] <grym> wickedjargon: print(f'{x_coord=}')
[20:22:15] <grym> talismanick: or np.einsum :D
[20:22:36] <talismanick> That's true, it is a genuine outlier in a sea of rank polymorphism
[20:22:45] <talismanick> I also find it quite clunky :P
[20:22:50] <johnjaye> talismanick: i've thought about making a mode for emacs somewhat like that
[20:22:53] <grym> wickedjargon: but if you love print debugging, you'll also love https://github.com/zestyping/q, which is that but doesn't suck
[20:22:56] <wickedjargon> Is there a minor mode / package that can help me with this? I just want to highlight the variable, run the function, and for the corresponding print statement to be added to my kill ring
[20:23:01] <johnjaye> it would basically work in the terminal and show you in a help buffer the current keybindings
[20:23:15] <grym> wickedjargon: (and you could tail -f /tmp/q in eshell or w/e)
[20:23:21] <talismanick> johnjaye: In the terminal?
[20:23:43] <johnjaye> yes. like how when you press F10 in terminal you can browse the menus
[20:24:01] * talismanick opens external terminal in wonderment
[20:24:04] <johnjaye> something like that but in a help buffer which would show keys q w e r t y and when you tab from one to the next it shows the current binding
[20:25:37] <grym> johnjaye: something like https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key/issues/213
[20:25:55] <bpalmer> wickedjargon: that would be an easy function to write.
[20:26:19] <talismanick> johnjaye:  Mm, I see. That's a little different. Although, you might take inspiration from the gnu-apl-show-keyboard functionality from the gnu-apl package, which displays symbol docs in a tooltip on mouseover.
[20:27:03] <talismanick> I meant a slightly more sophisticated (not sure how, though) version of having equivalents in side-by-side columns
[20:27:07] <wickedjargon> bpalmer, I'll attempt writing it. It'll be my first time actually programming in elisp.
[20:27:17] <bpalmer> wickedjargon: otherwise, I'd suggest looking at the yasnippet package which lets you write snippets which , e.g., use the current region as filler
[20:27:32] <wickedjargon> grym, I am reading about q, thanks. I will see if this suites me. :)
[20:27:36] <talismanick> (it's not a one-to-one mapping between the two languages, so it's a context switch at time to read from APL examples and figure it out in BQN)

[22:45:44] <grym> iirc, merely that the slide's author liked it
[22:46:30] <technomancy> the creator of Haskell uses it too, right?
[22:46:51] <grym> probably, he's a hoopy frood
[22:47:08] <parsnip> haskell-mode authors recommend M-x customize too
[22:47:20] <aidalgol> There has *got* to be a less ugly accessible font.
[22:47:50] <grym> ... but works at epic games now?  booo
[22:47:53] <parsnip> the articles about CERN using comic sans read like onion articles
[22:47:58] <bpalmer> one thing that comic sans often gets praised for is readability for people with dyslexia
[22:48:12] <grym> "all the graphemes are different" probably does help
[22:48:17] <parsnip> oh that was it
[22:48:21] <grym> serifs can help with that, too
[22:48:23] <bpalmer> there are other fonts that are explicitly designed for this, like OpenDyslexic
[22:48:55] <parsnip> somehow i bet comic sans is more widely available
[22:48:58] <technomancy> and https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible
[22:49:02] <galcerte> what
[22:49:11] <galcerte> CERN uses comic sans?
[22:49:19] <galcerte> well, I'm not surprised
[22:49:24] <grym> galcerte: famously, for announcing the higgs boson
[22:49:38] <parsnip> this thread desperately needs puns
[22:49:42] <galcerte> it's a cancer that's so metastasized it's not even funny

[22:50:02] <grym> galcerte: http://0x0.st/oZq4.jpg
[22:50:02] <galcerte> and here I was complaining that my uni made slides in comic sans
[22:50:05] <galcerte> on this subject too
[22:50:12] <grym> well, probably because of CERN then
[22:50:41] <parsnip> I know some physicists that are fluent in Microsoft PowerPoint.
[22:50:59] <parsnip> "black belt"
[22:51:09] <grym> hmm.  i should show this font to my old OS/360 friend, who is _extremely_ dyslexic
[22:51:32] <grym> ... but learned a whole pile of coping stratz in the late 40s and you'd never know
[22:58:16] <aidalgol> What is/was OS/360?
[22:58:49] <technomancy> it's somewhat famous for being the system described in Fred Brooks' book the Mythical Man Month
[22:58:49] <artefact> "but this font just looks like liberation serif" "oh right, i have disabled webfonts"
[23:00:05] <grym> an IBM operating system
[23:00:23] <bpalmer> it runs 360 days a year.
[23:00:24] <aidalgol> So is he a ROM construct running on an OS/360 mainframe?
[23:00:32] <grym> an old and wise family friend was an old, old time IBMer
[23:00:54] <grym> now he raises goats
[23:01:09] <technomancy> you can tell IBM is old school because they don't have a cool demonymn for employees
[23:01:22] <grym> and he retired in 199...5?
[23:01:24] <grym> maybe before
[23:01:41] <bpalmer> IBMer isn't cool?
