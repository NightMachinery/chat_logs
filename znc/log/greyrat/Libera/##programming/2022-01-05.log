[00:32:22] <apotheon> Whether PHP outperforms Python depends on how much Python is using C behind the scenes, how much the PHP application may have been written by children who can't code their way out of a paper bag, and whether the PHP is deployed in a performant way.

[01:14:59] <Thedarkb1-Work> pulse, my math is probably wrong.

[01:17:10] <pulse> the most absurd thing is when a moon hoaxer will use his (insanely complex) smartphone to show me a video of some moon hoax theory, while completely missing the irony of how incredibly complex the device they're holding really is compared to the supposed technological inability of people in the 70s to make a moon lander work
[01:17:29] <pulse> it's just absurd. i've given up on trying to persuade anyone

[01:31:18] <PlanckWalk> Solipsism can't be ruled out, but it's pretty pointless since it has no predictive value.
[01:31:32] <nomagno> Well, it is an antidepressant meant for tranquilizing
[01:31:33] <pulse> but it doesn't really help, it just makes the person in to a living zombie, incapable of normal human emotions
[01:31:46] <mrig> jelly: Well if one is partial to the notion of 'as above so below' then the self is just a reflection of something else.
[01:31:50] <mrig> so that can not be.

[01:32:01] <pulse> PlanckWalk, solipsism is a very spicy metaphysical concept
[01:32:03] <pyzozord> I'm thinking right now web dev job market is ridiculously amazing. You sneeze and you get a js job, if you look around you get well paid job. But maybe that won't be forever. Do you think web dev may consolidate into more competetive market and lower pay?
[01:32:12] <PlanckWalk> pulse: Really?  It seem sterile.
[01:32:31] <pulse> solipsism conveniently explains many conundrums, but creates another enormous one that is just inacceptable
[01:32:40] <nomagno> It is an antidepressant tranquilizer, going to water you down as a whole
[01:32:42] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't explain anything
[01:32:44] <pulse> PlanckWalk, only from the physicalist perspective

[01:33:13] <PlanckWalk> That's not an explanation.
[01:33:20] <Chpy0> I'm trying to quit coffee to avoid needing sedatives
[01:33:20] <nomagno> It's a compromise between being mentally shit and being in a comma. Not a very good compromise, mind you, but I can't further comment on pulse's friend's situation
[01:33:22] <pulse> but then since it does that, it invalidates the world and turns it completely nihilistic and meaningless
[01:33:28] <mrig> I had to go look up the word, have to admit that the description that is given is somewhat wanton.
[01:33:31] <pulse> PlanckWalk, well, it's "the" explanation. lol
[01:33:50] <pulse> philosophy of solipsism goes very deep because the thing just keeps flipping on and off
[01:33:53] <PlanckWalk> For example, does it explain "why didn't I get the job"?
[01:33:58] <pulse> it's the perfect strangeloop
[01:34:02] * PlanckWalk checks ... no.
[01:34:04] <pulse> PlanckWalk, yes, because you imagined it
[01:34:18] <PlanckWalk> It just punts the question back to "why did I imagien it?"
[01:34:24] <pulse> nomagno, idk, i'd do literally anything before i took any of that
[01:34:32] <PlanckWalk> And that applies to *everything* under the theory
[01:34:34] <Chpy0> why I'm cashier for 15 years? I must be dead and in hell
[01:34:38] <pulse> PlanckWalk, because you're god. it conveniently explains literally everything
[01:34:51] <pulse> which is why it's the most prototypical possible ontology
[01:34:53] <PlanckWalk> For every single question about the universe, it just punts back to "why did I imagien it?"
[01:34:59] <PlanckWalk> Hence, sterile.
[01:35:06] <pulse> PlanckWalk, well, "sterile" is one interpretation
[01:35:08] <nomagno> It conveniently goes against explaining literally anything.
[01:35:10] <mrig> PlanckWalk it is a phase of knowing and of belief through which people pass whilst escaping from sever mental/situational trauma; In this respect it is useful.
[01:35:16] <pulse> but see if solipsism holds, even "sterile" is _your_ own imagination

[01:41:10] <pulse> the problem with solipsism is that you can get a room and fill it with solipsists debating each other as to which one is the true one
[01:41:20] <PlanckWalk> Well, not really.
[01:41:23] <pulse> and then it collapses into some weird superposition
[01:41:25] <PlanckWalk> They
[01:41:27] <pulse> thus invalidating it
[01:41:30] <PlanckWalk> They're all the true one.
[01:41:48] <pulse> then why are they're arguing among each other
[01:42:01] <mrig> well seems to me that empiricism does not imply solipsism. 
[01:42:08] <PlanckWalk> "Because they imagined it"
[01:42:10] <mrig> That they are quite different.
[01:42:16] <PlanckWalk> (In other words, no explanation)
[01:42:22] <pulse> solipsism can probably drive you mad if you take it too seriously
[01:42:53] <pulse> i wouldn't be surprised if many schizophrenics are full on solipsists, even if they don't formalize it in any way
[01:43:06] <PlanckWalk> I would be very surprised

[01:43:44] <pulse> they seem very "in their own world" typically

[01:44:14] <pulse> it varies though
[01:44:50] <mrig> The difference between empiricism and rationalism is a nice comparison to ponder.

[01:45:52] <pulse> a psychedelic experience is very solipsistic in a way, too

[01:46:14] <pyzozord> mostly an
[01:46:49] <pulse> personally i think the baseline of the universe is such that it can't be conceptualized
[01:46:52] <mrig> Well when you get deeper into indian philosophy you learn about these things in a rather different light.
[01:47:02] <pulse> so all these weird metaphysical ideas that we've developed, they fall far short from what reality actually is

[01:47:20] <pulse> and same goes for all our scientific theories. they're "close enough" to be workable, but they are far from what is actually going on
[01:47:20] <mrig> much deeper than western philosophy goes, at least in so far as i am aware.
[01:47:33] <mrig> could be kept locked away in vaults somewhere.
[01:48:01] <pulse> so basically solipsism is like that, it fills a certain ontological gap, but it invalidates the rest of the thing. therefore it can't be the truth. the truth must transcend every concept

[03:55:09] <flakland> what you mean high level

[04:45:46] <jundran> In react with RR6 I have images in /src/public  and store the path in a object with a string like 'images/users/user-2.jpg' and this loads the images. It works but not on a nested route such as  http://localhost:4000/account/register. After I click to register a new user, for example, it tries to render the user profile image using
[04:45:46] <jundran> src=http://localhost:4000/account/images/users/user-2.jpg and the browser URL is http://localhost:4000/account/register. What can I do to fix this? Is there something I can change in the webpack config? Perhaps output: { publicPath: 'something' }? How do I take /account out the src to make it work?

[06:21:31] <PlanckWalk> Training for IQ tests seems to have upper bounds
[06:21:41] <apotheon> A test of intelligence should be a test of ability to learn something new given an explanation in terms of things you already know, with paraphrase later as a confirmation of learning.
[06:21:52] <InPhase> pulse: Reach for the melted chocolate and make a tasty snack?

[06:23:55] <PlanckWalk> It's highly correlated for lots of other things that we think of as "intelligent", as least in humans, so it's still useful.
[06:24:03] <sonny> some kids are gms
[06:24:07] <yBtNJW3j> I don't think most normal humans can become proficient in a completely new subject in two weeks.  These things take time.  There are reasons we teach math and English through twelve years of education in the U.S.
[06:24:19] <pulse> yeah, i don't see any area where you can not excel and score low on iq
[06:24:20] <sonny> lol
[06:24:24] <apotheon> It seems to be largely a combination of abstract reasoning capacity, learning capability, and a dash of conceptual spatial awareness.
[06:24:27] <pulse> i mean, outside of extremes
[06:24:40] <pulse> yBtNJW3j, not proficient, just adequately skilled
[06:24:50] <yBtNJW3j> Hmm ...
[06:24:53] <InPhase> IQ tests measure a real thing, that real thing is pretty important and very highly correlated with important intelletual performance results.  Buuut, administration of IQ tests is challenging, and each instance of an IQ test is a somewhat noisy measurement of that underlying property being assessed, and thus can exhibit both statistical and systematic errors that can be quite large, especially if 
[06:24:57] <apotheon> sonny: Kids tend to have higher IQs than adults.
[06:24:59] <InPhase> conditions are not carefully controlled, or the psychology of the person being tested is not correctly factored in or managed.
[06:25:04] <PlanckWalk> The average IQ of chess grandmasters is apparently around 130
[06:25:05] <pulse> then there's variety of different subjects so for example learning to juggle is completely different to learning how to take derivatives of functions

[06:25:34] <sonny> apotheon I don't seem them doing good on this test unless they just study for it 24/7
[06:25:42] <pulse> apotheon, kids have more neuroplasticity
[06:25:50] <pulse> adults can have that too, and that makes them fast learners
[06:25:56] <pulse> and fast learning is way better than iq imo
[06:26:03] <MsFoxEmilySmith> PlanckWalk well yea
[06:26:10] <sonny> only point of iq is to get into mensa
[06:26:18] <MsFoxEmilySmith> you'd have to be pretty dumb to memorize all those chess moves
[06:26:26] <PlanckWalk> I doubt there are any with IQ < 90
[06:26:37] <PlanckWalk> 90-100 I'm not so sure about
[06:26:42] <MsFoxEmilySmith> when you could just look them up \_ o \_
[06:26:52] <yBtNJW3j> The thing about tests is some can practice to score high on the test.  Those who are good at testing or knowing the test can also fake a lower score.
[06:26:55] <apotheon> pulse: Yes, I'm aware.
[06:27:01] <apotheon> (re: neuroplasticity)
[06:27:16] <InPhase> apotheon: Early tests took a different approach, but modern tests should be calibrated so that all ages have the same normalized distribution.  But some people stop intensively learning in adulthood, which might be the basis behind what you're referring to.
[06:27:22] <apotheon> In fact, it's pretty much tautological that kids would have greater neuroplasticity than people in their 30s.
[06:27:25] <pulse> i'm pretty sure even an 80 iq can become a chess gm
[06:27:34] <MsFoxEmilySmith> the top programmers in the world likely need an IQ of 140+

[06:30:00] <pulse> maybe playing chess by itself advances your pattern matching abilities so as to score high on iq tests :p
[06:30:02] <sonny> nah
[06:30:10] <PlanckWalk> But that may be a testing error, since apparently he has taken other tests later showing much higher results
[06:30:12] <sonny> there's a lot more gm's now
[06:30:18] <sonny> doubt fishcer did a test
[06:30:34] <MsFoxEmilySmith> chess grandmasters are mentally retarded
[06:30:38] <MsFoxEmilySmith> usually
[06:30:39] <pulse> probably computers have accelerated the GM learning curve
[06:30:43] <MsFoxEmilySmith> just very high in other intelligence
[06:30:44] <sonny> lol ok
[06:30:48] <MsFoxEmilySmith> like a subset of visual skills
[06:30:50] <MsFoxEmilySmith> lol
[06:30:54] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: I was about to suggest it would probably go up on a retest.
[06:31:01] <MsFoxEmilySmith> on average they wouldnt be that smart
[06:31:02] <pulse> some of them can play like 20 simultaneous games
[06:31:04] <sonny> you def don't pay attention to chess I can tell
[06:31:05] <pulse> or blindfold chess
[06:31:08] <yBtNJW3j> I would think chess grandmasters would be specialized.
[06:31:09] <pulse> did you ever try blindfold chess? it's brutal
[06:31:14] <MsFoxEmilySmith> and IQ test are about average
[06:31:22] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: It's easy to mess up one test.
[06:31:28] <sonny> simul exhibitions are cool
[06:32:08] <PlanckWalk> Yep, that 102 result was from an incomplete test in which he ran out of time.
[06:32:14] <MsFoxEmilySmith> if a computer can do it im less impressed by it
[06:32:40] <InPhase> echo "if a computer can do it im less impressed by it"
[06:32:48] <PlanckWalk> So yes, I'm much more confident that there are no grandmasters with below average IQ
[06:32:49] <sonny> lmao
[06:33:13] <pulse> i guess iq does have its uses
[06:33:24] <pulse> but intelligence in a broader sense is just much ... well, broader
[06:33:43] <sonny> PlanckWalk how many got tested?
[06:33:55] <pulse> an iq test says nothing about your ability to become a world class ice sculptor

[06:34:16] <PlanckWalk> pulse: I bet it still correlates, but a lot more weakly
[06:34:22] <pulse> really weakly
[06:34:26] <InPhase> pulse: For that you'd need an IC test.
[06:34:27] <nisstyre> ice sculpting is surely mostly about how much grit you have
[06:34:28] <pulse> it might correlate to something like a scientific career
[06:34:29] <MsFoxEmilySmith> or a world class computer scientist
[06:34:31] <MsFoxEmilySmith> even
[06:34:43] <MsFoxEmilySmith> 110+
[06:34:53] <MsFoxEmilySmith> or like 104 lol
[06:34:55] <pulse> i mean, iq test probably works good in extremes
[06:35:03] <pulse> if someone scores 65 then you can reason about many things
[06:35:08] <pulse> similarly if someone scores 180 you can reason about many things

[06:37:55] <nisstyre> the "general intelligence factor" is slightly more meaningful
[06:37:59] <apotheon> "meaningless" is a bit hyperbolic

[06:38:42] <InPhase> pulse: For things like placement of children, typically only one is used unless someone thinks it is incorrect and then people retest.
[06:38:49] <nisstyre> apotheon: IQ is based on g, the general intelligence factor, which is modeled using factor analysis, which is literally just a way of clustering traits
[06:38:51] <pulse> you can easily score high on iq yet do extremely stupid things in life
[06:38:52] <nisstyre> how are those traits chosen?
[06:39:04] <nisstyre> they're chosen as being things representative of intelligence
[06:39:10] <nisstyre> so you see how it's a circular thing there

But he's just trying to capture the notion that intelligence can operate in different manners with different types of skill.  The general

[06:54:28] <yBtNJW3j> When I think of intelligence, I think of things like mathematics and how far one can or does go in it.  Most will do basic arithmetic and maybe start algebra.  After that things get tougher with Geometry and Algebra II, then continues into preCalculus and Calculus.  One could go even farther into higher order calculus and higher orders of that.  There is probably a correlation in there somewhere.  Other factors one might try to look at would be

[16:02:57] <GeDaMo> Call by reference means the called function can change the value in the calling function
[16:03:11] <GeDaMo> It's not necessarily the same as passing a pointer
[16:03:16] <vdamewood> |smlckz|: And technically, a pointer isn't call by value.
[16:03:29] <vdamewood> Passing a pointer is call by value, but the value is a pointer.
[16:03:39] <GeDaMo> C is call by value so when you pass a pointer, it's the value of the pointer
[16:04:41] <vdamewood> C++ is call by value by default, but you can specify a function parameter as a reference. (when writing the function)

[18:20:16] <mrig> dang, can updating them really do that much to the system? I suppose so if it is written in c++

[18:21:52] <mrig> well I've no idea if the c++ references that are in my installed programs listing were put there by VS or not.
[18:22:18] <mrig> and whether or not updating them through VS effects the whole system.
[18:22:19] <vdamewood> Also, I wonder if the Visual C++ 2022 runtime runs on Windows 7.

[18:23:30] <vdamewood> Well, it's more about not breaking compatibility.
[18:23:36] <mrig> well what are those references too then? Will go and see what is said about them.
[18:23:52] <vdamewood> Well, what are the actual references?
[18:24:00] <mrig> All I know is that the compiler is a lot slower and buggyer with VS than prior to all of this nonsense.
[18:25:05] <amigojapan> Too bad, cause Vs was one of the few programs Microsoft seemed to do correctly

[18:27:56] <vdamewood> Yeah, that one could be a dependency of some other app.
[18:28:11] <mrig> and VS 2019 is slower than it was, though it did have a shead load of changes before I updated it, could be added in an update too.
[18:28:14] <vdamewood> So, I guess it depends on whether you have an app that depends on it.

[23:40:23] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, ah, that's the only way i've used it then.
[23:40:26] <pyzozord> right, the question is, what is a computer program
[23:41:03] <deniska> > A software application, or a collection of software applications, designed to perform a specific task
[23:41:08] <pyzozord> computer program is software which is computer instructions

[23:41:16] <[itchyjunk]> I've heard of things like GraphQL and it seems interesting, but i don't know what all it's used for 
[23:41:19] *** Joins: flakland (~flaknet99@32.211.211.39)
[23:41:42] <pyzozord> it gets blury, you can interpreted pretty much anything as computer instruction, mouse movement, passage of time
[23:42:02] <pyzozord> well hmm maybe not, maybe these are inputs
[23:42:18] <deniska> guess what, a program to run is also an input :)
[23:42:20] <vdamewood> I believe Alan Turing came to the conclusion "*shrug*" when it comes to "What is a program?"
[23:42:39] <apotheon> I like the American Heritage Dictionary definition of "program": "A set of coded instructions that enables a machine, especially a computer, to perform a desired sequence of operations."
[23:42:42] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: it's a a query language, like sql, but it uses different syntax
[23:42:47] <deniska> the definition of a program depends on how gatekeep'ey you want to be :)
[23:42:59] <apotheon> pyzozord: and semantics, for that matter
[23:43:01] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, but its not meant for databases right? you query the language itself?
[23:43:05] <[itchyjunk]> or how did it work?
[23:43:17] <vdamewood> deniska: I'm fine as long as HTML isn't a programming language.

[23:43:32] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[23:43:33] <[itchyjunk]> you query classes and figure out what the objects have in relationship to each other or osme such
[23:43:33] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: graphql implementation will make queries to data sources, possibly using SQL at the end of the day
[23:43:33] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: correct, it is designed and used as a http api 
[23:43:50] <apotheon> vdamewood: Unfortunately, I think HTML5 is Turing complete.

[23:44:02] <vdamewood> apotheon: Not on its own. Needs CSS.
[23:44:08] <apotheon> hmm
[23:44:13] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: you know how in a corporate setting, two teams are typically working on a site, frontend and backend
[23:44:13] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: usually serving as a protocol between two programs talking over internet, usually browser (js) with server
[23:44:18] <apotheon> I thought some canvas related stuff covered taht.
[23:44:20] <apotheon> s/taht/that/
[23:44:22] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, yes
[23:44:27] <flakland>  thanks for the annual reminder that CSS keylogger exists
[23:44:47] <vdamewood> flakland: Now is the time for annual reminders.
[23:45:03] <pyzozord> but really nothing stops you from making a database that has graphql api
[23:45:07] <Stefan26> graphql only return responses at the end of the day?
[23:45:08] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: and it's the backend which has direct access to data storage (often an sql database), so if frontend devs want some data which backend doesn't yet provide, they have to talk to backend, and talking to people slows development down
[23:45:15] <apotheon> Everybody celebrate Mungday.  Today is Mungday.
[23:45:34] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, oh is tat what it's really for?
[23:45:37] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: exposing SQL database directly to frontend is icky and hard, row level security is considered a fairly arcane concept
[23:45:44] <[itchyjunk]> frontend just talks to graphQL and backend later implements it?
[23:46:11] <vdamewood> apotheon: To be fair. I haven't fully analyzed the Turing completeness of HTML, CSS, or the combination of the two myself, so I might be blowing hot air.
[23:46:14] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: so instead there's this graphql thing which allows to expose backend storage in a more controlled manner, but more flexible for frontend
[23:46:14] <[itchyjunk]> this reminds me of some OOP principle that i can't remember
[23:46:23] <[itchyjunk]> hiding complexity behind abstraction?
[23:46:23] <pyzozord> deniska: i wonder why, when I think about it only arguemnt I actually have is "because separation!"
[23:46:43] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, this makes it sound like its useful in a lot more context
[23:46:49] <deniska> pyzozord: as I said, it involves talking to people, can't have that in agile environment :)
[23:46:49] <[itchyjunk]> hmm is graphQL popular?
[23:47:00] <ProfSimm> Is it a sound idea to make all identifiers literals in a language, and only interpret them as variables contextually
[23:47:05] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: it's up there in buzzwords I hear a lot
[23:47:19] <ProfSimm> [itchyjunk]: graphQL has almost the correct idea.
[23:47:26] <[itchyjunk]> wait, this remind me of some amazon letter thing bezos used where each team had to expose API and different team could only talk with API's and not directly
[23:47:38] <ProfSimm> [itchyjunk]: so many complex APIs go for it, because REST is a mess with complex queries
[23:47:41] <apotheon> vdamewood: I'm just going by vague impressions of past memories of things other people said, so . . . whatever.
[23:47:43] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: yes, very. I am working with graphql in more than 50% jobs
[23:47:55] <wedr> Question about multithreading...   should it be a concern, if I keep getting "address is already in use: connect" errors when attempting to run multithreaded database update queries?
[23:48:04] <mawk> yes
[23:48:08] <mawk> obviously
[23:48:12] <ProfSimm> The biggest mistake GraphQL did was return data as trees rather than relations
[23:48:16] <vdamewood> apotheon: And  neither of us cares to follow through.
[23:48:22] <vdamewood> *enough
[23:48:30] <mawk> you're using the same port for your sockets wedr?
[23:48:33] <pyzozord> well not as much as you know the primary things like programming languages or frameworks, but it in the category "library" it's at the top
[23:48:42] <mawk> normally you leave it up to the os to choose the port
[23:49:09] <wedr> mawk, uh... not sure. I never thought about this, because I assumed the Hibernate provider, Spring JPA, would handle this automatically.
[23:49:15] <deniska> I occasionally semi-jokingly propose to expose an ability to query SQL via an endpoint, given the row level security and roles are properly configured, but the idea still sounds other-worldy and nuts :)
[23:49:19] <apotheon> vdamewood: indeed
[23:49:26] <mawk> yeah well if you didn't write it you can assume it's fine wedr
[23:49:34] <mawk> weird though
[23:49:40] <apotheon> vdamewood: I still don't consider HTML a programming language.
[23:49:48] <wedr> mawk, oh, well damn, because now I don't know how to fix it. :(
[23:49:51] <mawk> do you have many connected sockets?
