[01:41:36] <Dr-007> how would i install this? via `pacstrap /mnt iwd` ? well.. i can google this, never mind
[01:42:09] <MrElendig> or pacman in the chroot
[01:42:20] <MrElendig> lack if iwd is not the problem though
[01:42:34] <MrElendig> the actual network probably works fine

[03:28:46] <MrElendig> make sure your mirror is up to date
[03:29:11] <pushrad> oh, i ran `pacman -Sy cmake` first, then ran pacman -Syu and it works
[03:29:30] <Dr-007> MrElendig, when i want to use NetworkManager and run `nmcli` https://bpa.st/IDPA i get that my wireless is unavailable. scanning for networks gives an empty list because of this
[03:29:30] <phrik> Title: View paste IDPA (at bpa.st)
[03:29:51] <MrElendig> nm is not going to fix your broken permissions
[03:30:01] <Dr-007> and i ran that command
[03:30:09] <sheep> never do pacman -Sy <package> unless you know what you're doing, and if you do that, always run -Su immediatrely afterwards. But you should almost always just do -Syu  instead.
[03:30:13] <Dr-007> but it didnt really do much
[03:30:30] *** Quits: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog) (Quit: = "")
[03:30:39] <Dr-007> it would probably easier by now te reinstall and this time from scratch with all packages
[03:30:49] <MrElendig> and nm is probably complaining  because you already have something managing the interface
[03:31:03] <Dr-007> MrElendig, i dont have any other services running

[03:31:34] *** Joins: beastDivision (~beastDivi@user/beastdivision)
[03:31:37] <Dr-007> thats why i ended up using wpa_supplicant by the way
[03:31:49] <Dr-007> because networkmanager didnt play ball

[03:32:23] <Dr-007> but does `pacman -Qkk 1>/dev/null` fix permissions
[03:32:31] <Dr-007> or only notice about whats wrong
[03:32:55] <Dr-007> there were like 10 notices
[03:33:04] <Dr-007> 2 that were standing out
[03:33:08] <Dr-007> about shadow files
[03:33:19] <thurstylark> -Qkk does not do anything, just notifies you of changes to tracked files

[03:33:28] *** Joins: MrElendig (~Urist@archlinux/op/MrElendig)
[03:33:38] <Dr-007> thanks thurstylark 
[03:34:16] <thurstylark> this is covered in the manpage, btw
[03:34:17] <Dr-007> maybe networkmanager doesnt play ball because when i installed ubuntu, fedora and debian i always got mentions like 'you need non-free apt-get repositories'
[03:34:43] <Dr-007> to install drivers for wifi
[03:34:50] <MrElendig> no
[03:34:59] <pushrad> sheep yeah i know, it was just this once to resolve the package conflict
[03:35:01] *** Parts: __dev (sys@user/dev/x-7984917) (It`s time to go...)
[03:35:07] <thurstylark> what ubuntu does has no bearing on what arch does
[03:35:09] <MrElendig> if that was the case then wpa_supplicant etc wouldn't do anything either
[03:35:18] <thurstylark> ^
[03:35:25] <Dr-007> MrElendig, yeah thats what i figured
[03:35:38] <Dr-007> ah its wierd. im pretty sure i did everything right.

[03:42:14] <Dr-007> any tips additions?
[03:42:16] <thurstylark> networkmanager uses wpa_supplicant by default. if you want to use iwd with networkmanager, there is a little extra config necessary
[03:42:30] <thurstylark> you can, of course, use iwd independantly if you prefer
[03:42:34] *** Joins: pushrad (~pushrad@user/pushrad)
[03:42:43] <thurstylark> which is how its done on the iso
[03:42:46] <Dr-007> should i add wpa_supplicant also as a package?
[03:43:01] <thurstylark> I just said that it would be pulled in by nm

[03:43:29] <Dr-007> well, i formatted the internal partition
[03:43:33] <Dr-007> so im going to reinstall now
[03:43:33] <thurstylark> it's a hard dep. specifying it would be redundant, but do whatever makes you feel better
[03:44:02] <Dr-007> well, i want my wifi to work, doesnt really matter which way. but networkmanager seems the best way in arch
[03:44:05] *** Quits: pushrad (~pushrad@user/pushrad) (Remote host closed the connection)

[03:45:04] <Dr-007> anyways, MrElendig told me to run a few things and we discovered that there's file permission issues
[03:45:23] <Dr-007> so a reinstall would surely fix that and hopefully networkmanager would work out of the box then

[05:45:13] <Dr-007> right?
[05:45:15] <kevr> dig will tell us which exact server its querying
[05:45:31] <kevr> hop the nameservers?
[05:45:41] <kevr> no, pacstrap does not hop nameservers
[05:45:47] <Dr-007> no dig
[05:45:54] <kevr> what do you mean by hop?
[05:46:32] <kevr> with dig, you can specify a nameserver directly, or you can just use what the interface ends up using by default to resolve.
[05:47:00] <kevr> for me, both 8.8.8.8 and 9.9.9.9 succeed.

[07:02:47] <kevr> most of the time, that happens because the file is legit missing

[14:21:56] <grawity> where you installed some new packages alongside some five-year-old ones
[14:22:10] <grawity> do you have a shell running as root?

[14:23:01] <rdg> but I have nix packages available
[14:23:11] <rdg> so I can run su/sudo from there
[14:23:25] <grawity> yeah you'll need *some* setuid thing that is not affected by the system glibc
[14:23:47] <rdg> sudo: /nix/store/y9i0dcs6pi6l756df17v6qscmx8qcv0z-sudo-1.9.4p2/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set

[15:41:35] <predicament> heh hey thrice
[15:41:36] <thrice> pulseaudio is a dep for eg. gnome-settings-daemon, plasma, etc.  It has a reverse conflicts with pipewire-pulse, and pipewire-pulse "provides" pulseaudio
[15:42:04] <ayekat> but you can replace pulseaudio by pipewire in a second step, because it provides pulseaudio at least
[15:42:39] <ayekat> (or simply install the gnome packages and pipewire in a single step, of course ^^)

[21:40:37] <klanc> Hi! Just wanted to ask if the new wiki visual layout is here to stay, or if it's just a bug or something on my end? Thanks!
[21:41:12] <sheep> I am also seeing a different layout in the wiki in firefox. I have not tried other browsers
[21:41:51] <klanc> I haven't seen anyone complain on reddit or forums, so I assumed it might be a bug
[21:41:54] <damarusama> isn't there the left column missing ? 
[21:42:05] <damarusama> on the wiki
[21:42:16] <sheep> you can click the hamburger menu in the upper left to show the left column
[21:42:17] <klanc> Yep, and a lot of wasted space
[21:42:21] <klanc> IIRC
[21:42:38] <sheep> the width appears to adjust for the content
[21:42:57] <sheep> I agree. there's too much wasted space
[21:43:06] <sheep> I want text to take up the full available width
[21:43:22] <sheep> if I want it to be narrower then I'll put the browser in a smaller window
[21:43:35] <klanc> Yup, it was perfect already
[21:43:51] <damarusama> and I want burger and french fries, but there is no restaurant around :(

[23:08:21] <Khorne> mefistofeles, preferences, Appearance, Use Legacy Vector or use MonoBook
[23:08:25] <BrainDamage> new mediawiki theme, supposedly better for the average user, yet changing it requires login, using a url fragment or worse user side js
[23:08:27] <mefistofeles> ugh, okay
[23:08:40] <tirnanog> or by appending ?useskinversion=1 to every request path.
[23:08:40] <Khorne> But I concur, what the hell is responsive about this when it doesn't use the available space
[23:08:41] <mefistofeles> let me see if reader mode solves this
[23:09:41] <Betal> mefistofeles: less unused space if you are used to open the wiki with "half screen" browser, like 50% split screen or some tiling WM

[23:11:26] <phrik> Title: Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements/Frequently asked questions - MediaWiki (at www.mediawiki.org)
[23:11:51] <Khorne> BrainDamage, amusingly, that site /uses/ all the space
[23:11:54] <BrainDamage> the irony is that their own page doesn't do what they preach
[23:12:15] <tirnanog> so, is no one going to talk about the 'burger' menu?
[23:12:22] <mefistofeles> BrainDamage: I hate that... 
[23:12:22] <Betal> BrainDamage: in old theme, didn't you have the big collum with language selection that 'still there' no matter the browser size?
[23:12:26] <tirnanog> which appears no matter the screen dimensions, as far as I can gather.
[23:12:36] <mefistofeles> "some people found it better"... well? who? what people? where's the data?
[23:12:41] <mefistofeles> so much for transparency
[23:12:56] <BrainDamage> Betal: and now I have another on the right side too
[23:13:12] <mefistofeles> and then silly excuses "oh, don't worry, we'll use the blank space later"... so you are agreeing that it's wasted space? xD
[23:13:19] <tirnanog> I have to click this stupid burger icon just to get the navigational links on the left at 1080p.
[23:13:19] * MrElendig hopes the wiki migration will be brought up again at some point
[23:13:47] <Betal> BrainDamage: not here when I resize the browser to 50%
[23:13:51] <tirnanog> even though it's vacated space otherwise.
[23:13:55] <Khorne> tirnanog, that doesn't happen for me, once its unfolded it stays unfolded
