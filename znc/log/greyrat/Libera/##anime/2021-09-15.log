[04:59:30] <Guest41> i like to learn
[04:59:37] <SpiritOfSummer> there was a professor who I was pretty sure was to blame for why it was so hard for me 
[04:59:55] <ButterNoodle> I had one of those the first time I went
[04:59:56] <SpiritOfSummer> his teaching method came to be a bit of a disgrace after a while
[05:00:06] <SpiritOfSummer> and he became the primary reason I stopped taking classes
[05:00:09] <SpiritOfSummer> and he's retired now
[05:00:16] <SpiritOfSummer> what if...
[05:00:17] <dfch> ButterNoodle, nah, altho am liking the character, but wouldn't watch hentai with her

[10:18:52] <MootPoot> So all the electrical heating stuff you get is 1500w unless you wire your own breaker 
[10:19:03] <MootPoot> amigojapan: main breaker or sub breaker 
[10:19:08] <MootPoot> I'm talking about sub breakers 
[10:19:15] <amigojapan> I think it's main
[10:19:25] <MootPoot> My main is like 150A
[10:19:40] <amigojapan> Oh
[10:19:44] <MootPoot> And it has I guess 25-30 smaller breakers on it, 15A each 
[10:20:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: tepco had a scam going on where they don't let you buy your own breaker. They rent different breakers of different capacities for different prices
[10:21:12] <amigojapan> I just rented the cheapest one
[10:21:18] <MootPoot> thats dumb
[10:21:19] <amigojapan> 30A
[10:21:23] <amigojapan> Yeah

[10:21:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but they are a monopoly
[10:21:53] <MootPoot> are you sure that was renting your breaker
[10:21:58] <MootPoot> or it was 30A service
[10:22:08] <MootPoot> that included your breaker
[10:22:12] <amigojapan> It's just renting the breaker
[10:22:23] <MootPoot> what's your service?
[10:22:55] <amigojapan> I think the maximum possible size breaker was 70A
[10:23:10] <amigojapan> For my apartment
[10:23:15] <MootPoot> oh for your apartment
[10:23:16] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:23:19] <MootPoot> maybe
[10:23:27] <MootPoot> my home service and breaker is 150A
[10:23:37] <MootPoot> technically you can draw more then that
[10:23:48] <amigojapan> I see. Nice. And you for cheap electricity
[10:23:54] <MootPoot> next step up is 300A service I think
[10:24:04] <MootPoot> but that needs a lot of work

[10:24:45] *** Joins: Abrax (~Abrax@user/abrax)
[10:25:42] <amigojapan> MootPoot: anyway 30A is more than enough to keep the breaker from tripping even with AC+dryer+toaster on at the same time
[10:25:59] <MootPoot> What really
[10:26:03] <MootPoot> Hmm
[10:26:18] <amigojapan> My previous apartments would trip very easily
[10:26:27] <MootPoot> I doubt it... Are you sure your AC is not on a different breaker
[10:26:38] <amigojapan> Maybe it is
[10:26:46] <MootPoot> My portable AC itself takes up to 13A
[10:27:23] <MootPoot> Typically here ACs and dryers and kitchen are all on their own breaker
[10:28:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: by dryer I meant hair dryer
[10:30:21] <MootPoot> Oh lol
[10:30:34] <MootPoot> I thought you were talking about a clothes dryer
[10:30:51] <amigojapan> No. I don't have a clothes dryer
[10:30:56] <MootPoot> Idk I don't really use hair dryers, a towel is plenty
[10:31:14] <amigojapan> Tomako uses it
[10:36:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's my day off. I want to do something
[10:36:25] <amigojapan> Maybe I will go to the mall
[10:36:58] <MootPoot> What are the covid lockdowns there like
[10:38:12] <amigojapan> We don't really have lockdowns in Japan. We have suggestions from the government. But most companies obey. Like restaurants are supposed to close at 8pm and not serve alcohol
[10:39:03] <amigojapan> Otherwise everything seems to be open

[14:48:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: fun fact, in 4D space you can turn 3D objects inside out

[19:40:56] <emmeka> I don't know what nick she's using rn, but she used a few others in quick succession over the past few months
[19:41:03] <JesseDesu> she genuinely hated how she was being treated on irc

[19:43:12] <JesseDesu> ah
[19:43:34] <JesseDesu> theres a lot of that
[19:43:53] <JesseDesu> like every mexican and filipino with spanish blood
[19:44:11] <emmeka> yeah. I don't like to try and claim it myself... I mean, I have no connection to the community or culture, I'm basically assimilated.
[19:44:31] <JesseDesu> at a certain point in time it becomes moot
[19:44:34] <JesseDesu> say 500 years
[19:44:44] <emmeka> so I exist in the weird limbo state of ongoing cultural genocide, not quite white and not quite not.
[19:45:53] <amigojapan> I actually grew up 19 years in Mexico
[19:45:55] <JesseDesu> every culture has been raped by another at some point in human history
[19:46:06] <JesseDesu> if not 500 years then maybe 100,000 years ago
[19:46:16] <emmeka> JesseDesu thing is as recently as the 1940s most of my ancestors were still uncontacted, so we're at the very messy point in history
[19:46:58] <JesseDesu> uncontacted by the main fleet you mean
[19:47:48] <emmeka> yeah. I mean white dudes had been up there sporadically I guess, but there was no coordinated effort to establish political control of the area.
[19:48:22] <JesseDesu> i wonder which culture will be the last to embrace cell phones as a new technology
[19:48:43] <emmeka> Sentinelese?
[19:49:09] <emmeka> they have the right idea, those guys. whenever someone modern-looking approaches their islands, they just shoot arrows immediately and kill on sight.

[21:55:22] <Bco1981> pteague: what cpu is it ?

[22:08:01] <Bco1981> pteague: have you reseattet the cpu ? ram problems can be wrong pressure on the cpu, bending the pins under it to not have contact. causing "ram" problems.
[22:08:34] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: pc has been in a static state no?
[22:08:47] <ButterNoodle> replace power supply first
[22:08:59] <Bco1981> have had this happen to me.... last time a pin from the socket fell out
[22:09:01] <ButterNoodle> then press F
[22:09:08] <Bco1981> it broke when i took out the cpu
[22:09:13] <ButterNoodle> lol what kinda mother board?
[22:09:17] <ButterNoodle> brand
[22:09:21] <ButterNoodle> bet MSI
[22:09:21] <pteague> Bco1981, i9-9900k doesn't have pins ... it just has lots of tiny squares the socket touches
[22:09:27] <Bco1981> some old asus board.
[22:09:35] <ButterNoodle> thats what he means pteague 
[22:09:35] <Bco1981> pteague: the socket has the pins
[22:09:48] <ButterNoodle> pressure makes the contact
[22:09:49] <pteague> ButterNoodle, asus rog strix z390e gaming mobo
[22:10:03] <ButterNoodle> yep
[22:10:17] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: hmmm i can't remember what brand it was
[22:10:23] <pteague> yeah & i completely pulled out the cpu earlier & reseated it after using a can of air to blow on stuff
[22:10:26] <ButterNoodle> but its doing board tests
[22:10:38] <pteague> & i was expecting pins XD
[22:10:43] <ButterNoodle> naa
[22:10:52] <ButterNoodle> *flat perfection
[22:11:05] <Bco1981> yeah, and don't tighten too much

[22:15:26] <ButterNoodle> cpu->ram->video->boot
[22:15:40] <ButterNoodle> so me thinks he tried using onboard vid with the card still installed
[22:15:48] <ButterNoodle> and possibly card issue
[22:15:53] <pteague> ButterNoodle, yeah, only thing i have plugged in right now is case, hard drives, 2 memory sticks, & cpu
[22:16:19] <ButterNoodle> still stops at yellow light?
[22:16:59] <ButterNoodle> red->yellow and no white
[22:17:17] <ButterNoodle> what about clearing bios too
[22:17:28] <pteague> after cmos reset it walked through the light sequence several times, each time stopping at ram, & most times completely powering fans off when rebooting to try to retest memory configuration ... which last time it wasn't doing
[22:17:46] <death916> have u tried jsu 1 stick
[22:17:48] <death916> and alternating dimms
[22:18:02] <ButterNoodle> what about that memory training switch?
[22:18:03] <pteague> yeah, i rotated through all 4 sticks i have just using 1 at a time before
[22:18:04] <ButterNoodle> u try both ways?
[22:18:10] <death916> i had an issue similar to this and it was faulty ram
[22:18:20] <death916> and also a fualty dimm
[22:18:26] <death916> 1 stick was dead and 2 dimms
[22:18:40] <ButterNoodle> single dimm goes into a2
[22:18:46] <pteague> i set it to off when it was powered off, i changed memory sticks, then turned it back on (which my reading of it is what you're supposed to do?)
[22:18:56] <ButterNoodle> ye
[22:19:05] <death916> is memory trainign the thing that chanegs clocks?
[22:19:06] <ButterNoodle> u rotated all 4 through slot a1?
[22:19:09] <ButterNoodle> *a2
[22:19:21] <death916> u shld be runngin stock to test no xmp or anything
[22:19:22] <pteague> yeah, 1 at a time in a2
[22:19:30] <ButterNoodle> death916: its some asus thing that underclocks ram when it detects errors
[22:19:30] <death916> test diff dsimm then a2 comld be dead
[22:19:34] <death916> ah
[22:19:52] <ButterNoodle> possibility of all 4 being dead is near impossible...
[22:19:57] <death916> ya
[22:20:06] <death916> but they r only trying a2 atm arent they
[22:20:09] <death916> so should try others
[22:20:13] <death916> i had 2 go out at once
[22:20:30] <death916> think it was a2 and b2
[22:20:33] <death916> they were side byside
[22:20:46] <ButterNoodle> idk if bios could be corrupt
[22:20:56] <death916> unlikely but possible

[22:24:44] <death916> ya ButterNoodle's pl,an is probablky best bet
[22:24:54] <mixfix41> is warranty covering this?
[22:25:00] <mixfix41> sounds like new parts
[22:25:00] <ButterNoodle> since thats a recent build .. you can probably RMA whatever is dead
[22:25:04] <ButterNoodle> mostly
[22:25:15] <pteague> jan 2019
[22:25:21] <ButterNoodle> most stuff has a 1-2 year warranty 
[22:25:26] <ButterNoodle> woof
[22:25:43] <mixfix41> juicy warranty
[22:26:37] <mixfix41> get it and sell it cose wanna go with a different product maybe
[22:27:02] <mixfix41> or it might last
[22:27:21] <mixfix41> be a good product tester if it is your main
[22:28:05] <mixfix41> i know my main gaming rig i know the kinks. it does have a memory fuss but if i dont fiddle with switching cases its reliable 110%
[22:29:11] <mixfix41> i could cook habachi on the processor its THAT reliable
[22:29:53] <ButterNoodle> what kinda back splash do you use?
[22:31:23] <mixfix41> is this tiling question?
[22:31:57] <mixfix41> we dont have back splashes 
[22:32:11] <mixfix41> i g everyone uses those mosaic ones tho if they do
[22:32:20] <mixfix41> its pretty popular
[22:32:45] <mixfix41> filthy dish washers get water everywhere
[22:33:47] <mixfix41> my intel mobo is the most fussy it will only start once and you have to have all your peripherals set or else you have to unplug it for a time being but it comes out perfect everytime
