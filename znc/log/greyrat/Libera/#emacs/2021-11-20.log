[01:53:15] <johnjay> yeah i just pop it up read it a bit then hit q
[01:53:21] <artefact> or just bind a key to automatically close help windows
[01:53:32] <johnjay> so  you're asking how to close the other window except with the command which specifically closes the other window
[01:53:56] <johnjay> well i guess that would be C-x 1
[01:54:08] <artefact> unless you had a carefully crafted window layout
[01:54:24] <johnjay> i saw a package that did that
[01:54:35] <johnjay> forgot the name. but like it laid out your emacs windows according to the golden rule

[01:54:58] <thardy> just checking if there is a way to quit the help and stuff without focusing the help since it pulls it up unfocused and you can scroll its just a bit odd that i have to focus it to quit it. i should say quit, not close window. normally i have something in the window it replaces and just want to go back to previous state
[01:54:59] <johnjay> ,golden-ratio-mode
[01:55:00] <fsbot> Just to have it is enough.
[01:55:18] <johnjay> you don't. C-x 1 quits it

[01:55:43] <thardy> alright, thanks, i will try that next time. thanks
[01:56:04] <johnjay> even more difficult. switch over with C-x o then C-x 0 to kill that window
[01:56:12] <thardy> killing the buffer is more effort than  C-x o q
[01:56:19] <artefact> or use something like ace-window
[01:56:20] <roadie> (setq help-window-select t) ;; focus in help popup so q gets rid of it immediately
[01:57:48] <thardy> alright thanks everyone i was just wondering if there was a common thing and i was being stupid by doing C-x o q. C-x 1 kills the whole window, i just want to bury other buffer i guess. i will look into it

[09:25:36] <z3t0> Hi all, I have a bit of a potentially stupid question. I tried googling this but clearly dont know enough about the problem to google the right keywords. When I launch emacs, it starts asking me if I want to load into the local variables from certain README.org  files. I think this is related to me using org mode with source code blocks to be
[09:25:36] <z3t0> tangled into my config.el and then loaded, but I never had this come up before and don't have it happening on another machine with emacs as well. So im a bit confused as to where to start, any help is greatly appreciated
[09:26:24] <z3t0> I think these readmes are from packages i've installed. But why would it try to load the readme files

[18:44:22] <johnjay> can you disable those things in c files?
[18:45:34] <johnjay> if so then there's something wrong with php-mode i expect
[18:45:37] <akk> They were disabled last time I edited a C file, but that was a while ago. Checking ...
[18:47:10] <akk> aha, that's because in C mode I already define all those keys to be self-insert. I guess I never found a way to turn them off  in C either.
[18:47:59] <akk> At least that means I already have the function written to enumerate all the keys that have bad electric behavior.
[18:48:24] <johnjay> well. c-mode is fairly old code. i doubt it has such a problem
[18:48:35] <johnjay> did you test all this in emacs -q
[18:48:39] <johnjay> it could be something in your init.el
[18:48:53] <akk> good point, I didn't

[18:53:45] <johnjay> php mode should be in your ~/.emacs.d/elpa folder since it is from melpa
[18:53:59] <johnjay> what you have to do in these situations is start emacs -q. then copy the line from init.el that adds melpa
[18:54:14] <johnjay> then run package-install php-mode from melpa
[18:54:21] <johnjay> a bit annoying but it will give you a clean base to work from
[18:54:33] <johnjay> you can also create a temporary emacs dir in /tmp
[18:54:50] <johnjay> something like 'HOME=/tmp emacs' and then all downloads and such will onlya ffect /tmp
[18:55:05] <johnjay> but to check c mode you shouldn't need to do any of that since it is built in
[18:55:06] <akk> Looks like php-mode is in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/elpa/php-mode-1.23.0.
[18:55:23] <akk> Where is the init.el where I should be looking for a melpa line to copy?
[18:55:27] <johnjay> maybe it's from the package manager then
[18:55:35] <johnjay> sometimes they take popular packages on debian and put them in apt
[18:55:53] <johnjay> aha yeah it is there
[18:55:55] <johnjay> elpa-php-mode
[18:56:10] <akk> yes, there's a "elpa-php-mode" apt package which is installed
[18:57:20] <akk> in emacs -q C mode, (setq c-electric-flag nil) correctly disables the electric reindenting on /, but that doesn't tell me much about php-mode.

[19:01:58] <johnjay> by the way it works for me
[19:02:05] <akk> It looks like emacs with a separate HOME does have php-mode already, where emacs -q didn't.
[19:02:19] <johnjay> i installed php-mode then tried disabling c-electric-flag and that does change the autoindent behavior of typing '/'
[19:02:29] <johnjay> yes it's a *melpa* package
[19:02:30] <johnjay> not build in
[19:02:39] <johnjay> so you have to install it yourself 
[19:03:28] <johnjay> i suspect it's something in your init.el because i can change that setting fine on my emacs
[19:03:38] <johnjay> so start bisecting it would be the quickest option
[19:03:45] <akk> It's already installed though if I do HOME=/tmp/emacs emacs index.php
[19:03:58] <johnjay> probably because it's in site-lisp
[19:04:12] <johnjay> and you said it's not working when you run that command? ^
[19:04:18] <johnjay> the electric flag thing?
[19:04:58] <akk> and you're right, setting the electric flag to nil does disable it in that emacs. So there's something in my setup making it especially aggressive.
[19:05:10] <akk> Time for divide-and-conquer on my .emacs, I guess.
[19:05:19] <johnjay> ah ok. so likely something you changed is turning it back on after you disable it
[19:05:24] <johnjay> ok good luck!
[19:05:47] <johnjay> by the way emacs -q loads site-lisp files
[19:05:55] <johnjay> so testing with emacs -q should show the same result

[19:31:55] <johnjay> ajak: yes but you don't want to sit there waiting for 5 years for dir c: to finish

[19:33:09] <hodapp> operating systems aren't really defined by what they can compute
[19:33:35] <ajak> yes, i don't see how that precludes interaction with hardware at a certain level

[19:33:51] <ajak> i would think turing completeness would prove that it can?
[19:34:01] <ajak> johnjay: yes i'm not thinking about performance
[19:34:06] <edgar-rft> let's slow down our harddisks to the speed of elisp
[19:34:20] <hodapp> ajak: it doesn't preclude such interaction, but it also doesn't tell you a thing about whether it's possible
[19:34:52] <pingpongball> i thought why emacs is hackable
[19:34:55] <pingpongball> this is obious
[19:35:11] <pingpongball> because of the beautifulness of elisp for tinkering
[19:35:13] <pingpongball> if so,
[19:35:21] <ajak> how not? linux kernel is mostly written in c, if both of c and elisp are turing complete then doesn't that mean the kernel *can* be written in elisp?

[19:35:48] * acdw writes a programming language called "turing complete" that /isn't/ turing complete
[19:35:56] <johnjay> ajak: the fact you can simulate turing complete language in another elides crucial facts like speed or size. what good is a elisp interpreter that has more lines of code than atoms in the universe?
[19:36:07] <hodapp> ajak: that reasoning makes no sense whatsoever
[19:36:24] <edgar-rft> yeeah, let's write a kernel in brainfuck
[19:36:30] <acdw> lmao
[19:36:34] <hodapp> ajak: particularly, it's assuming that Turing completeness is what matters in order to show that... Turing completeness is what matters

[22:12:14] <acdw> idk, but posix make is also trash
[22:14:06] <technomancy> I think when I first found out that Windows NT was posix compliant it was a pretty clear sign that posix is completely meaningless.

[22:20:42] <contrapunctus> When I tangle+compile an Org literate program and get any errors, I want to jump to the error in the Org LP, rather than the tangled source. I tried `(advice-add 'compile-goto-error :after (lambda (&rest args) (org-babel-tangle-jump-to-org)))`, which works...
[22:20:53] <contrapunctus> ...except each time you do that, your buffer/window setup changes. If you start with <org file> | <compilation-mode>, you end up with <tangled source> | <org file>, and vice-versa :\

[22:36:09] <mattf> s it ERC's fault or is there some sort of global configuration for how windows that are part of the same process will open, how does that work

[22:40:05] <wgreenhouse> I recall doom hates customize for some reason
[22:40:17] <wgreenhouse> but that will at least inform you the options exist
[22:40:38] <mattf> wgreenhouse: yeah but i can use "describe variable" to look up for such thing
[22:41:23] <wgreenhouse> mattf: M-x apropos is also useful, or just C-h v erc TAB
