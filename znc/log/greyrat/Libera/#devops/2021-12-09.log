[21:58:25] <Alex86ns> Hello everyone.
[21:58:55] <rawtaz> lo
[21:59:37] <kwilczynski> Hi.
[21:59:42] <Alex86ns> Is there any way to create .war file which contain python virtual environment. We want to add it on Tomcat, after deploying want to run bash sript to set active env.
[21:59:44] <kwilczynski> https://twitter.com/armon/status/1469002519196090371?t=zFnt94oKn405UCG31DMcfg&s=19
[21:59:46] <Alex86ns> is it posible?
[21:59:46] <kwilczynski> Nice.
[22:01:47] <Alex86ns> We also don't want to install python on machine because python will be packed in .war, after deploying we wan't set Path to target bin with Python and run code..
[22:02:17] <Alex86ns> I know .war file is for java, but just imaging how to do it.
[22:02:20] <rawtaz> Alex86ns: isnt that something you should ask in a tomcat channel? :)
[22:03:07] <kwilczynski> Alex86ns: You can add whatever you want technically to a WAR file.
[22:03:21] <Alex86ns> I think I will get answer faster here
[22:03:34] <kwilczynski> However, not sure how it suppose to work with Python inside?
[22:03:50] <kwilczynski> What is going to run it?
[22:03:50] <Alex86ns> I want to pack python command also
[22:03:51] <rawtaz> i guess you're after some kind of post-deploy script
[22:04:25] <Alex86ns> we have some application writen in python, and we also have another java application
[22:04:34] <Alex86ns> and want to merge both app
[22:05:09] <Alex86ns> java app working on default tomcat port, python will work on 9000
[22:05:28] <Alex86ns> after deploying java app will call localhost:9000
[22:05:36] <Alex86ns> and use it as iframe
[22:06:20] <Alex86ns> we don't want to install all python dependency, we wan't to pack it all together in .war
[22:06:33] <rawtaz> oh the ideas people have :-)
[22:06:54] <Alex86ns> I know bash is possible run from Tomcat, just tomcat user need to have permision for it
[22:07:39] <Alex86ns> extracted files will be in webapps, and tomcat user already have permision for that.
[22:09:17] <Alex86ns> someone who gave be good advice will regale with beer :)
[22:09:19] <rawtaz> so just put it in there and then run it?
[22:09:35] <rawtaz> i mean what is unclear? it sounds like you know how to do it. or is your question specificaully about how to add stuff into a war file?
[22:09:45] <rawtaz> (which i think is just a zip file in disguize)
[22:10:20] <Alex86ns> how to run automatically extracted .bash script from Tomcat?
[22:10:50] <rawtaz> presumably you can write a little java code that runs a shell command or such
[22:13:31] <rawtaz> oh my god, there are actually several hits on this topic, just DDG "tomcat run python"
[22:15:35] <kwilczynski> Yeah
[22:15:49] <kwilczynski> :(
[22:15:52] <kwilczynski> Ops.
[22:15:54] <kwilczynski> :)
[22:21:32] <kwilczynski> Alex86ns: I assume you want Tomcat to run Python as CGI, right?
[22:21:52] <kwilczynski> Which is quite odd, given that Python can be made into it's own web server and such.

[22:28:35] <rawtaz> cool
[22:28:40] <rawtaz> im not at all certed thouhg :D
[22:28:45] <rawtaz> make sure you enjoy it
[22:28:52] <rawtaz> otherwise whats the fun
[22:29:34] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: \o/
[22:29:43] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Go team lantech19446 go!
[22:29:45] <kwilczynski> :)))
[22:31:10] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: https://github.com/donnemartin/awesome-aws  and especially https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws might come handy.
[22:31:39] <kwilczynski> Ah seems GitHub got released.

[22:32:36] <rawtaz> FWIW there is an #aws channel i think
[22:35:55] <lantech19446> nice on all counts
[22:36:16] <lantech19446> the only reason i'm going for the certs is because I need something to speak to my knowledge where true experience doesn't exist
[22:41:50] <lantech19446> I think learning cloud will be fun, the part that really confuses me is all the different aws products and their billing but from what I understand there's entire departments that handle only the billing and that no one on our level really understands it
[22:42:14] <slaughter> Going for lower level AWS certs forces you to study some pretty commonly used and essential AWS services and config, and if you do it right you even get some experience. More than just something for your CV IMO
[22:42:51] <lantech19446> that's what i'm hoping
[22:47:41] <lantech19446> I think once I get my certification I may start looking for jobs

[22:57:12] <al3xprey> there are companies who use a very standard stack of all aws products
[22:57:23] <al3xprey> most devops work does not include all aws products, because there are LOTS of them
[22:58:10] <al3xprey> it can be overwhelming at first but it's not that hard, and it's good knowledge, cause it's almost 2022 and nobody likes to bring up their own cloud
[22:58:22] <al3xprey> it's public clouds all the way, especially with devops
