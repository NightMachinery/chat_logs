[00:03:55] <xaltsc> Yeah, but how do you use channels in place of a mutex ? Say I have one goroutine f that writes to the channel and one other g that only reads it. How can I make sure that g always get a value ? I.e., if f hasn't written something new, g get the old value.
[00:04:18] <ikke> That's not how channels owrk

[00:07:18] <fizzie> You can have a goroutine that is always attempting to (a) write a value to the channel, or (b) read a new value (from another channel) to change the value it's trying to write, using a select statement in a for loop, and that way build the equivalent of a mutex-guarded box with channels. Though hopefully you can arrange your channels more reasonably than that in practice.

[00:08:49] <fizzie> I was debating on whether to attempt it on a phone keyboard, and leaning towards no. ;)
[00:10:06] <bpalmer> at that point, atomic.Load/Store might also appeal.
[00:13:15] <xaltsc> My question, really, is what is the most goish way to implement the scenario I've described above. It's fairly easy to it with mutex, but idk.
[00:13:30] <nuclearg1> anyone here have any thoughts / opinions on redis go clients? My team suspects gomodule/redigo is the bottleneck around connection pooling, and i don't really know where to start. I'd like to attempt to build some sort of benchmark app that uses go-redis and redigo to see which one scales better, but I don't know what I'm doing at the moment
[00:13:44] <ikke> xaltsc: a channel is more like producer/consumer process
[00:13:47] <bpalmer> xaltsc: it sounds like a mutex is the simplest way to do what you want.
[00:13:56] <ikke> Something produces values, something else consumes it
[00:14:15] <bpalmer> xaltsc: I write a lot of go without using channels ; they're a neat feature of go but really only show up in certain special circumstances.
[00:14:55] <bpalmer> you might formulate your idea as 'something uses the latest value of x and subscribes for changes to x', which naturally maps to channels
[00:15:14] <ikke> bpalmer: was about to suggest something like that
[00:15:15] <bpalmer> but 'use the latest value of x which might be assigned elsewhere' naturally maps to a critical region or to atomics.
[00:15:55] <xaltsc> ok, thanks, I was a bit misled by the tour I guess and didn't want to use the programming styles I'm used to in other languages since I'm quite new to go
[00:17:02] <ikke> xaltsc: if you model your problems like you would in other languages, solutions would look similar too

[01:18:55] <pyzozord> so when I import net the binary will automatically be dynamically linked?
[01:19:24] <b0nn> pyzozord: AIUI it's a matter of "knowing" what packages are using libc (etc)
[01:19:28] <fizzie> I believe it'll just happen if CGO_ENABLED=1 (the default) and something in the program's full set of dependencies (either a standard library package like "net", or a non-stdlib dependency) uses cgo. Could be there's more subtlety to it.
[01:20:07] <b0nn> I don't think that you can contract your way out of it when you use libs that use the dynamic C deps
[01:20:35] <b0nn> So, instead, you'd have to write your own libs, but they'd ulitmately have to pass off to C
[01:20:55] <fizzie> You can avoid it in the case of "net", though, since there's pure-Go replacements: https://0x0.st/oPXG.txt
[01:20:57] <b0nn> (where "C" is the dynamic C deps)

[01:26:03] <fizzie> Well, no, not quite directly. For that, see https://pkg.go.dev/net -- "On Unix systems, the resolver has two options for resolving names. It can use a pure Go resolver that sends DNS requests directly to the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf, or it can use a cgo-based resolver that calls C library routines such as getaddrinfo and getnameinfo."

[01:52:41] <fizzie> It was just to suggest that with the right (platform-specific) combination of flags (the issue lists some examples), you could have even a build that uses cgo produce a static executable. If it's possible to statically link the C code that gets called. For example on glibc I believe the `getaddrinfo` function isn't really supported when linking statically, or something along those lines.

If you mean "update the version of an existing package you're depending on to a newer one", that's `go get <package>`, or possibly `go get -u <package>` if you want to also upgrade everything it depends on.

[05:47:31] <fikran> have a sample? I'm being told go.mod don't exit.
[05:47:34] <fikran> exist*
[05:47:39] <fikran> because they are in the parent directory.
[05:48:35] <fikran> so the Dockerfile's "COPY . ." didn't copy the go.mod file.
[05:49:36] <rewt> run docker build in the dir with the file
[05:50:14] <fikran> but, the dockerfile doesn't exist in that directory...
[05:50:15] <rewt> what are you trying to do exactly?  build a go binary in a docker container?
[05:50:22] <fikran> Yes.
[05:50:30] <rewt> the Dockerfile can be anywhere you want
[05:50:38] <fikran> oh?
[05:51:06] <rewt> docker build -f path/to/Dockerfile

[05:55:10] <rewt> just wondering... there may be other ways of doing what you really want to do
[05:55:19] <fikran> I'd be interested!
[05:55:37] <rewt> why not just `go build` outside docker?
[05:56:56] <b0nn> Hmm, I build in containers - usually there's a COPY step first, to put all of the code in the container
[05:57:19] <rewt> could also just mount as a volume
[05:57:45] <b0nn> CI/CD
[05:58:15] <fikran> yeah, I'm not that familiar with how to do this.
[05:59:00] <rewt> is this just to build something locally, or do you want automate it, or what are you doing exactly?
[05:59:01] <fikran> so, I manually run `cd directory ; go build .` and then "docker build .`
[05:59:40] <rewt> why docker build?  `go build` already builds the binary

[06:03:28] <rewt> hmm, ok
[06:04:01] <rewt> so docker is not /required/ for go at all; it's only if you want to create a docker image for other reasons

[08:10:44] <bluebird> Why is January 31st + 1 month, March 3rd? Isn't this off? https://go.dev/play/p/JOo8Y9Uw2TD
[08:12:58] <b0nn> https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.AddDate
[08:13:06] <b0nn> AddDate normalizes its result in the same way that Date does, so, for example, adding one month to October 31 yields December 1, the normalized form for November 31.
[08:13:54] <b0nn> bluebird: at issue is what adding one month /means/ - 28, 29, 30, or 31 days
[08:16:48] <b0nn> IIRC to decrement/increment the month you need to  split the date into its three components, then make and addition
[08:17:01] <b0nn> And handle the edges yourself
[08:18:25] <bluebird> Mm, I may try an work with the normalized dates. Seems like my test case broke because my unit test was using time.Now() and doing math off that, which happened to break on March 1st.
[08:18:57] <b0nn> heh, I fake time in my tests

[22:04:40] <piwu> What is a sane way to collect results from goroutines? I have a for statement launching a goroutine for each line scanned.
[22:04:40] <piwu> I expect to get back a struct, to combine them to parent func output []structs.
[22:04:40] <piwu> I want to exit as soon as any of the goroutine encounters an error.
[22:04:40] <piwu> ***
[22:04:40] <piwu> I can't do multiple for x := range channel; as they are blocking.
[22:04:40] <piwu> I have a separate goroutine to do wg.Wait(), and then close() all channels one by one (I couldn't find a closeall() / variadic method to do this, a bit redundant code)
[22:04:40] <piwu> https://gobyexample.com/closing-channels has go func() { for { j, more :=... but using it I got len(output) = 2 (instead of expected 3 in test), and used to get 3 90% of the time
[22:04:41] <piwu> If I debug, it always gives me 3. I'm using append() in the gobyexample variant of my code.

[22:10:09] <piwu> I've encountered the question of handling return values of goroutines before. Parent function returns ([]structName, err), parent function launches goroutines, stop on first error, and each non-erroring goroutine is expected to emit a structName, that gets added to the mutual slice/pool of the parent return ([]structName, nil)
[22:10:18] <bpalmer> well, if there's code it's worth looking at, but one of the simpler approaches to what you wnt is this:

[22:11:52] <bpalmer> type MaybeStruct struct{err error; value *StructType}; func foo(ch <-chan MaybeStruct) MaybeStruct { if err != nil { return MaybeStruct{err: err} } return MaybeStruct{value: value}}
[22:12:06] <bpalmer> and then you start 5000 goroutines and then just collect 5000 MaybeStructs
[22:13:07] <bpalmer> for ms := range ch { if ms.err != nil { cancelFunc(); return ms.err } ...}
[22:13:44] <bpalmer> all of the go routines accept a cancellable context, you return early as soon as there are errors, etc.
[22:14:11] <bpalmer> rather than range ch , I guess that should be for i := 0; i < 5000; i++ { ms := <- ch; ... }
[22:15:13] <piwu> about ctx / context: can context.Context help me or not here? I still haven't found an use for it across various packages, not exactly sure where it would be useful in general (larger perspective).
[22:15:16] <han-solo> close on the channel from sender, will break the loop, no ?
[22:15:27] <piwu> would, yea
[22:15:33] <han-solo> so just close it on error ?
[22:15:43] <piwu> I want to fwd the error
[22:16:01] <piwu> but here, yes, I'd prefer the one channel approach instead (by bpalmer)
[22:16:33] <piwu> re: I want to fwd;; otherwise you say just 'error error we had some kind of error, don't know what thouhg'
[22:17:01] <piwu> I'll refactor the code bits to use one chan and see what blows up next
[22:17:24] <han-solo> i am thinking of two channels, one for data and other to signify done, and done will send a struct with err
[22:17:29] <han-solo> but yeah, that's two channels

[23:01:28] <nuclearg1> could someone here point me to some documentation on using switch / case with multiple expressions? I have never seen this before, so I'd like to just understand the bbenefit of rolling multiple things into one case statement for example? like case "foo", "bar":  rather than case "foo": followed by case "bar". Normally i would just stack case statements together.
[23:02:48] <b0nn> nuclearg1: I don't know of any docs that might be helpful, but I use case int, int32, int64: a lot, because it groups together the cases in an easy to read manner
[23:03:26] <nuclearg1> is it just a readability thing? Is the performance the same as doing case int: case int32 case int64 (followed by new lines)
[23:03:37] <b0nn> I mean, this is a style/ readability question at the end of the day, rather than a performance
[23:03:44] <nuclearg1> ok thanks i just wanted to confirm
