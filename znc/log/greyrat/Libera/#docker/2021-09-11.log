[00:00:41] <Razva> ok, but in this case how will nginx know that it should be attached to `erp_default`?
[00:01:00] <Razva> I guess all containers that are defined in the compose file are added to the same network?
[00:01:06] <tang^> iirc, it's attached by default to the project's network

[02:45:38] <codebam> would someone be able to help me figure out why I'm getting a permission denied for my docker-compose here? https://paste.sbehan.ca/xGj.txt https://paste.sbehan.ca/Kkj.txt 
[02:46:01] <codebam> it's for app and api
[02:46:23] <echelon> i don't think it has anything to do with your docker-compose
[02:46:50] <echelon> you should do chown on the directory in your entrypoint script maybe
[02:47:19] <codebam> how would I do that?
[02:47:38] <codebam> does this node container have an entrypoint script directory that I can mount a volume to?
[02:47:43] <echelon> chown -R node /home/node/
[02:48:05] <codebam> yeah but where do I put that
[02:48:33] <echelon> oh, you didn't actually build these images
[02:49:29] <codebam> no this is the node image
[02:49:44] <codebam> I'm just mounting volumes like they say to in their examples
[02:50:12] <echelon> you don't need to mount anything
[02:50:51] <codebam> well I mean to mount my code
[02:51:02] <codebam> so that I can run it from within the container
[02:51:51] <echelon> where it says.. command: "npm run start" .. do instead.. command: "bash -C "chmod -R node /home/node && npm run start"
[02:53:03] <codebam> will that work, because I'm not root
[02:53:05] <codebam> ?

[02:53:32] <echelon> oh, right..
[02:54:48] <codebam> but I don't understand why it wouldn't work, since my user is uid 1000 and node inside the container is uid 1000
[02:55:21] <echelon> yeah, if it's owned by root, you might hit a roadblock since your docker-compose drops to user node
[02:55:33] <codebam> inside the container it's owned by root though
[02:55:40] <echelon> i would recommend rebuilding the image with your own Dockerfile
[02:55:50] <codebam> inside the container all the volume mounted stuff is owned by root
[02:56:16] <codebam> okay
[02:56:59] <echelon> so in the Dockerfile you would just use "FROM node:current-alpine"

[02:57:15] <echelon> then just CMD chmod -R /home/node
[02:57:37] <echelon> then you would run docker build against the Dockerfile
[02:58:00] <echelon> i dunno why they made the base image retarded like that though
[02:58:38] <echelon> oops.. run CMD
[02:59:01] <echelon> RUN chmod -R /home/node
[02:59:26] <codebam> it works if I don't use the node user but use root
[02:59:29] <codebam> inside the container
[02:59:35] <echelon> right
[02:59:46] <echelon> it's good practice to not use root

[03:17:27] <echelon> other thing you can do is set the ports parameter

[14:43:01] <Habbie> i don't know about AWS ECR specifically, but if you tag an image, latest or otherwise, some other image might lose that tag
[14:43:03] <Habbie> and become untagged
