[09:17:48] <Rockwood> thx for reply
[09:20:13] <gde33> assuming you have a lot of them what would be the fastest way to select nodes or is the difference completely insignificant?
[09:20:41] *** Quits: jargon (~jargon@184.101.78.74) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:22:16] <hmw[at]> gde33: In general, keep your CSS selectors short. Use the most straight forward way to select your elements. Also, when you are thinking about performance, you likely have way too many elements to begin with. If you can, split the page and use pagination.
[09:23:26] <gde33> hmw[at]: I know but my problem is... well... I dont agree? haha
[09:23:53] <gde33> hmw[at]: js and css are pretty damn fast nowadays, hardware is also fantastic, huge html pages are supper responsive but building the dom is terrible??
[09:24:14] <gde33> its just silly how slow it is
[09:24:30] <hmw[at]> Really sounds like your approach is bad. Can you provide a link so we can look at it?
[09:25:18] <gde33> oh you are not wrong it is a bad approach by definition but the why is rather silly
[09:25:48] <hmw[at]> I don't know your page, so I can't really tell. _usually_ something is done in a suboptimal way, when this happens
[09:26:10] <hmw[at]> Or something insane like 10000 images
[09:26:20] <gde33> its hard to explain what I mean I'm sorry
[09:26:24] <gde33> well that is a good example
[09:26:29] <hmw[at]> Is it even a CSS issue though?
[09:26:38] <gde33> we have lazy loading, you could put a million images on a page :)
[09:27:03] <gde33> but the dom limits it at about... say 1000?
[09:27:08] <hmw[at]> You'd have to unload images, you can't just add more and more. Browsers can only handle that much
[09:27:14] <gde33> 1000 is really to much, more like 400 or so?
[09:27:32] <gde33> 400 empty boxes outside the viewport :P
[09:27:32] <hmw[at]> 1000 is a lot already. I'd expect such a page to be sluggish on some devices
[09:27:55] <gde33> slugish to load, everything else works really well nowadays
[09:28:22] <hmw[at]> Depends on the device. Not everyone runs their browser on a gaming PC
[09:28:54] <hmw[at]> Perhaps you can improve things by unloading assets that have been scrolled out
[09:29:43] <hmw[at]> You can also optimize the number of http requests. With such huge pages, you should see a difference
[09:29:50] <gde33> yeah that is the train of thought really, how is that my job?
[09:30:17] <hmw[at]> How would I know, you signed a contract :)
[09:30:21] <gde33> imagine a native application with something that looks like table rows, at howmany rows would you put the limit?
[09:30:31] <gde33> billions?
[09:31:46] <hmw[at]> Certainly not, by far. I would optimize and use pagination. Even in a native program, you can't hold billions of entries and achieve usable scrolling
[09:32:02] <gde33> the pagination in the native application doesn't show
[09:32:49] <gde33> say we are going to sort 100 000 table rows
[09:33:13] <hmw[at]> It is a non-linear (worse than) relation. The more CSS rules you have, the more the browser has to work through for each element it renders. That's one reason, why the feasible limit of complexity is seemingly very low
[09:33:26] <gde33> its not designed for it I think but I imagine js would do just fine? You just cant put it in the viewport :P
[09:34:32] <gde33> I turned the style off in firefox and it was only a tiny bit faster. It just has default styles that are similar to custom?
[09:34:39] <hmw[at]> Also keep in mind, that modern web design is most of the time abusing CSS for something, it wasn't designed for
[09:35:11] <hmw[at]> `live
[09:35:11] <Selvvir> hmw[at], Please provide a live page or a working demonstration of your problem to make it possible to debug. If it's local or private, copy your HTML and CSS into a `testcase in a `paste server like http://jsfiddle.net or http://codepen.io. Screenshots and plain text code pastes are difficult to debug.
[09:35:47] <gde33> good point, as I cant really formulate the picture in my head I should illustrate it with an example (as a last resort haha)
[09:37:04] <gde33> going to have to work at that a bit
[09:37:53] <hmw[at]> From what I heard, I'd guess I would implement some kind of caching mechanism combined with agressive unloading of assets
[09:38:25] <hmw[at]> Can get a little tricky, if scrollbars are involved, but I have done that before too
[09:38:26] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:38:35] <gde33> me too
[09:38:53] <hmw[at]> What general type of page is it?
[09:39:15] <gde33> but if you jerk the scrollbar up and down you get flaky behavior
[09:39:42] <gde33> imagine a fast side scrolling game in the 80's
[09:40:00] <hmw[at]> Page too long :)
[09:40:33] <gde33> why could the dinosaur computers do this without dropping a frame? lol
[09:40:51] <hmw[at]> They didn't have CSS
[09:41:08] <hmw[at]> and a DOM holding everything at once
[09:41:22] <gde33> the resolution was bad, they had few colors but they did have much more complicated stuff going on than css could ever do
[09:41:32] <gde33> uhh the dom I mean
[09:41:37] <gde33> css should be more than fast enough
[09:41:53] <hmw[at]> Programs back then optimized in ways, we are now too lazy to do
[09:42:08] <hmw[at]> A LOT less abstraction layers too
[09:42:30] <hmw[at]> Ask me everything about it. I still code for the Commodore 64
[09:42:38] <gde33> cool
[09:42:57] <gde33> I started with 6510 machine code :)
[09:43:03] <hmw[at]> I miss proper text mode on graphics cards. It was soo much faster (e.g. with tcpdump)
[09:43:14] <gde33> didn't get the point of asm, I was that young
[09:43:34] <hmw[at]> It is never too late. I can recommend ASM on the C64, it is super easy and fun
[09:43:42] <gde33> nop is a better description than AE?
[09:43:45] <gde33> lol
[09:43:53] *** Quits: _9pfs (~3fe02e3b@166.67.247.35.bc.googleusercontent.com) (Quit: Connection closed)
[09:44:04] <hmw[at]> $EA was NOP. It always reminds me on a certain gaming company
[09:45:29] <gde33> I had lots of fun with code generation, more of a joke nowadays. Ill make one: Adding up an array is done  eval("a="+arr.join('+'))
[09:45:57] <hmw[at]> ouch
[09:46:01] <gde33> haha
[09:47:30] <hmw[at]> Another possible optimization: Cure the divitis
[09:47:33] <hmw[at]> `divitis
[09:47:33] <Selvvir> hmw[at], Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
[09:47:42] <hmw[at]> Use as little wrapper elements as possible
[09:48:20] <hmw[at]> Don't give each entry its own list of menu options, instead inject them dynamically and remove after use
[09:48:35] <gde33> right
[09:48:54] <hmw[at]> etc, etc. In short, keep the DOM tree small and congruent with what is seen on the screen
[09:49:28] <gde33> I had divs with an image a heading a description and a button. I thought I'd be clever and remove the <p> from the description and things got slower
[09:49:38] <hmw[at]> huh
[09:50:17] <gde33> I think the issue is that it has to account for flowing text around stuff?
[09:50:59] <hmw[at]> That'd be an issue when the layout changes and has to be recalculated. Are you using DocumentFragments?
[09:51:05] <hmw[at]> (I guess you should)
[09:51:15] <gde33> if I give each of the inner elements an ID would that be faster than styling the parrents children by class?
[09:51:29] <hmw[at]> Not by much, if at all
[09:52:04] <gde33> yes, fragments are considerably slower than inserting a giant html string into the page
[09:52:06] <hmw[at]> You mentioned that it stays slow, even with the custom styles disabled in your browser. That hints at the DOM being the bottleneck, not the CSS
[09:52:21] <gde33> yes
[09:53:03] <gde33> then if I remove the nodes from the page and insert them again it does 1000 in 20 ms
[09:53:30] <hmw[at]> Also, check the network tab in your dev tools and see, if something is too slow there
[09:53:33] <gde33> so building the nodes is the problem
[09:53:39] <gde33> cloning them is just as slow
[09:53:52] <hmw[at]> It all triggers reflows, which are expensive
[09:53:56] <gde33> everything is inline
[09:54:20] <gde33> even if I don't insert the fragments it is supper slow
[09:54:51] <hmw[at]> It really would help, if I could browse the page myself
[09:55:31] <gde33> I'm working at various optimized versions, the live version is not very representative. Ill send a pm

[15:50:58] <rendar> should i use 'background: #000000;' or 'background-color: #000000;' ?
[15:55:12] <DPA> Depends. background sets multiple things, including background-color, background-image, background-position, etc. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background#constituent_properties
[15:55:12] <DPA> So, if you want to override them all, reset them, and just set the color, use background. Otherwise, use background-color. If the other constituent properties aren't set anyway, it may not matter.
