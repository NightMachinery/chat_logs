[02:13:24] <gilberth> All this nursery stuff reminds me of my Lisp interpreter in C, where I would cons new environments on the stack by default and evacuate it to the heap only when a closure is constructed. This was quite a performance boost.

[02:23:56] <hayley> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P4ELM0nB9M
[02:23:56] -ixelp- Messages (Remastered) - YouTube
[02:27:55] <hayley> gilberth: Sure, though by tossing out the whole nursery in one go, evacuation is O(1), whereas replication in ML is O(graph) and evacuation with mutable objects is O(nursery).
[02:29:46] <hayley> gilberth: "Well, there will always be people who are more of a leader than others. That's natural." And they're not making a hierarchy by leading if they can't fire anyone (loosely speaking). And then someone has to find a reason to need a leader of course.
[02:32:20] <selwyn> are parallel complexity classes useful? why don't i hear more about them?
[02:32:22] <gilberth> hayley: Don't forget that most want a leader, because thinking and decision-making hurts the brain. Otherwise: Projects can be forked all the time. See, I quit McCLIM for my reasons. For one thing I was too bad at convincing others about my ideas how to implement things.
[02:36:44] <gilberth> selwyn: They are from a theoretical point of view. This also is loosely connected to HW. E.g. take a ripple carry adder, its O(n). [n = number of bits] A carry lookahead adder is O(log n), but needs more transistors. You could say that addition is O(log n) given unlimited [die] space or parallelism. It still is O(n) with serial processing.
[02:37:18] <selwyn> i see
[02:39:02] <gilberth> Not all problems could benefit from parallelism. At the end of the day this boils down to data dependency. So, yes, talking about parallel complexity classes can be useful.
[02:40:04] <selwyn> thing is that quantum computational complexity classes are often compared to p and np
[02:40:19] <hayley> OTOH I have to wonder if it is safe to have a region which is being collected while a thread is allocating into it. I'd like to reuse partly filled regions if memory is tight, but it is more complicated to do that.
[02:41:34] <selwyn> sorry, bpp and qma (which is a kind of probabilistic np)
[02:41:47] <gilberth> selwyn: I know very little about quantum computing. But similar reasoning about complexity classes should apply here, too.
[02:41:47] <hayley> While it could be made to work (even with a bitmap, one 128 byte line is one byte) it'd be false sharing hell.
[02:41:53] <selwyn> but why not parallelise those. perhaps the parallelisation is not interesting enough
[02:43:22] <selwyn> anyway, goodnight 
[02:43:31] <gilberth> Take care!
[02:44:12] <hugo> How is Lisp as a platform for learning Open GL? I have seen a few implementations, but still wondering if C would be a "safer" bet?
[02:45:50] <moon-child> most of the resources are for c, but the api is the same in either case.  It should not be very difficult to translate
[02:45:56] <hayley> Well, I could apply similar reasoning as I did for the read barrier. You don't compact pages with lots of objects, as they wouldn't be fragmented. So I wouldn't reuse pages with many objects as allocation buffers either.

[02:49:49] <hayley> The worst a collector can do is turn a filled line free, which would be nice but not necessary to catch. And the worst a mutator can do is turn a free line filled. So logically they don't really affect each other? 
[02:52:38] <hayley> Hm, no. Another thing is that we might allocate some object, then put a reference somewhere to it, which trips the write barrier, and there would be a race as the object may or may not be written. But surely there is some rule for it in the memory model? I guess the write barrier emits a memory fence somewhere.

[08:15:10] <gilberth> I wonder whether I could find any literature about that kind of optimizations.
[08:19:03] <gilberth> But this is basically inlining and/or loop-unrolling. Both of which are more or less the same.
[08:42:04] * hayley spent the morning tweaking an A* implementation a fellow student wrote.
[08:44:09] <hayley> Seemed to get on well. We discussed GCs for some reason (perhaps that I use a picture of myself with the Handbook as a profile picture), leading to the olde "Moon patiently told the student a story" koan on refcounts. Then a strategy for optimising Python code.
[08:44:10] <hayley> Well, also that the script we got started Minecraft with a pretty small heap size.
[08:46:26] <hayley> Fun to tweak the search heuristic. If you properly account for diagonal moves (remembering we use a 3d Cartesian grid and generate moves in {-1, 0, 1}^3) being longer then it's less wobbly. Make it more expensive to build bridges and it switches to traversing chasms.
[08:54:16] <hayley> I was worried that using arrays rather than sets and priority queues would be slow, but apparently it was fine when doing mazes someone made. Except with an outdoors area there's more states to traverse.
