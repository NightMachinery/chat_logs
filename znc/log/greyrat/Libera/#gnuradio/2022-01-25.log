[00:15:18] <drmpeg> Well,  I have a prototype that Rob gave me, but it doesn't work with the current software.

[13:29:15] <marvinXP> mobizmn[m]: huh, in 3.10.0.0-rc4 it's even syntax erroring
[13:29:18] <marvinXP> for me
[13:35:01] <marvinXP> hmm‚Ä¶ weird. "module 'gnuradio.digital' has no attribute 'packet_utils'"
[13:37:16] <funkylab[m]> not weird, these got thrown out mostly in 3.8
[13:37:21] <funkylab[m]> (IIRC), latest in 3.9
[13:38:30] <funkylab[m]> err +0.1; so, mostly removed in 3.10, sorry
[13:38:37] <funkylab[m]> was mixing up stuff in my head, but CHANGELOG.md set me straight
[13:40:10] <marvinXP> it's stil there, I just needed to an an import block
[13:40:24] <marvinXP> it's giving me zero output though
[13:40:39] <marvinXP> or rather, "not triggered"
[13:41:25] <marvinXP> mobizmn[m]: if you turn off the triggering then the output you'll see output. But the tags should be generated, so you found a problem.
[13:42:11] <marvinXP> mobizmn[m]: or if you pull down the path loss to zero

[14:00:50] <drmpeg> The packet_utils issue was fixed with commit https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/commit/b42996b1569722d34dad2057406e4a6c3de99366
[14:13:19] <mobizmn[m]> <marvinXP> "mobizmn: or if you pull down the..." <- I am using GNU Radio 3.8. I changed the Threshold Method from Absolute to Dynamic. This started showing some output.
[14:13:50] <mobizmn[m]> I did this because this example (https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gr-digital/examples/packet/example_corr_est.grc) had that setting set to dynamic and it was working.
[14:17:41] <mobizmn[m]> <marvinXP> "mobizmn: if you turn off the..." <- And yeah, changing the trigger settings from 'Tag' (set as default in this flowgraph) to Free (with Threshold Method set to Absolute) also started giving output.

[16:01:30] <DerekKozel[m]> GRC does write the GR version into the generated Python.
