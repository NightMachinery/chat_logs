[12:52:07] <digitok> or wait maybe not reverse
[12:52:29] <digitok> looks like filter = remove

[12:57:55] <digitok> maybe ^\d{3} would also work then
[12:58:20] <digitok> but it's still weird that some of the other ones didn't work either with or without being reversed
[12:58:47] <digitok> anyway glad it's working :) back soon
[13:06:23] <re101-horse-14> ^\d{3} also worked :)

[16:47:49] <OTE> Good Morning --- I am new to working with regex and am trying to figure out a build a regex expression that would allow a string that must start with an alphabetical character (no numbers or punctuation) and may only contain up to 3 digits at the end, and only the period or hypen. However they cannot be the last character.  I was trying on the
[16:47:49] <OTE> regex101 website and came up with the expression "^[A-Za-z]+([A-Za-z.-]{1,50})+[A-Za-d0-9]{0,3}" but it does not seem to work when I ran it against some test strings. Any thoughts or guidance would be appreciated. 
[16:50:51] <digitok> can you share the regex101 link containing your test strings
[16:50:53] <digitok> !link

[16:52:25] <OTE> https://regex101.com/r/oYntgf/2
[16:53:38] <digitok> the main issue is that you're missing the /m flag
[16:53:50] <digitok> but we can improve the regex a bit
[16:53:59] <OTE> What is the /m flag?
[16:54:28] <digitok> it allows ^ and $ to match the start/end of a line instead of the start/end of the whole string
[16:54:29] <OTE> @di
[16:54:36] <digitok> which we need for testing here
[16:54:58] <OTE> @digitok thank you. 
[16:55:26] <digitok> ok so the rules are
[16:55:43] <digitok> start with a letter, no digits except at the end where there can be between 0 and 3
[16:55:55] <digitok> period and hyphen are allowed but not at the end
[16:56:02] <digitok> anything else?
[16:56:41] <OTE> Max Length 55 characters. 
[16:56:53] <OTE> No Spaces
[16:57:37] <digitok> and for simplicity we can say max length is 52 before the 3 optional digits?
[16:57:48] <digitok> looks like that's what you had

[16:59:42] <digitok> that should actually be {1,52}
[16:59:48] <digitok> but maybe 50 is ok :p
[17:01:47] <OTE> Thank you. Just curious in this expression  ^\b[a-z.-]{1,50}\d{0,3}\b$ how is it preventing the period or hyphen from being used as the first or last character? 
[17:03:30] <digitok> \b is a "word boundary" which is basically a zero-width assertion that matches between a "word char" and a non word char, word char being a-zA-Z0-9_
[17:04:12] <digitok> since neither . nor - are word chars, and ^ and $ (start/end of the string) aren't either, then the char next to them must be a word char
[17:04:25] <digitok> and the only other chars we're allowed are a-z and \d (0-9)
[17:04:35] <digitok> allowing*
[17:04:47] <OTE> ah... ok. Thank you this was enlightening. 
[17:05:49] <digitok> \b is commonly used to match words that aren't part of a larger word, \bword\b won't match "word" in "theword" etc
