[00:11:08] <feoh> But none of the big distros picked KDE probably out of fear of TrollTech or the Qt company or whatever they're called this week pulling shenanigans with the licensing.
[00:11:09] <meff[m]> the fact that my phone can do this helps so much when both of my wrists are telling me to cut them off
[00:11:12] <companion_cube> today I found myself wishing that waze (!) of all things, had voice command

[03:21:50] <rwb> note that what airbnb describes is also done by youtube - this is how they can ship new features without you updating the app, like recommendation categories a while back
[03:22:25] <rwb> you can also check this yourself by checking the network requests youtube.com makes. the returned JSON is essentially a VDOM which is hydrated by the client code

[03:33:46] <chenghiz_> "What if we could pass the UI directly to the client and skip the idea of listing data entirely?" sounds like html...
[03:34:31] <chenghiz_> if only we had a markup language to describe an interface that could be serialized and sent over the internet!
[03:35:02] <rwb> but that's too unstructured you see
[03:35:17] <rwb> what if we could define a schema for this document tree...
[03:35:29] <rwb> then attach the schema to the tree description.
[03:35:41] <rwb> it's still a markup, and it's also extensible...
[03:35:55] <rwb> hmmm... what should we call it?
[03:36:11] <chenghiz_> ðŸ¤”
[03:39:02] <meff[m]> hey hey, don't forget to have markup to describe the markup
