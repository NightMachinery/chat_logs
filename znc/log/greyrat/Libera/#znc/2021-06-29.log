[01:57:55] <torus> I'm not convinced
[01:58:44] <Khaytsus> So you're implying znc has some issue that reconects frequently? ;)
[01:58:59] <torus> I can connect Tor-->ZNC-->Libera without any issues. Tor is verified working. The connection to Libera is successful (and so, presumably, creds are acceptable to the server).
[01:59:23] <torus> I just want to get my setup working again like it was yesterday
[01:59:26] <torus> :(
[01:59:36] <haskl> Could someone help me with something/do me a favor? Could someone tell me how many messages I missed after you see a part message from me? I want to make sure my ZNC is configured right to get messages while I'm offline.
[01:59:36] <Khaytsus> Ah, you're using tor.
[02:00:00] <haskl> Oh yeah I want to use Tor with ZNC and Libera soon.
[02:00:01] <Khaytsus> haskl: So you're going to quit (all clients?) and then come back I guess?
[02:00:10] <DarthGandalf> haskl: what's the earliers/latest message you see?

[02:02:09] <Khaytsus> You'll have no quit message.
[02:02:16] <haskl> Okay I'm going to quit lemme know, thanks.
[02:02:17] <Khaytsus> Just say you're leaving and disconnect your client.
[02:02:19] <Khaytsus> heh
[02:02:39] <DarthGandalf> If ZNC quit, it couldn't possibly learn any message what's here
[02:02:44] <MetaNova> right
[02:02:46] <Khaytsus> :D
[02:02:57] <MetaNova> clients still show quitting/joining though

[02:03:04] <Khaytsus> Fair confusion.
[02:04:14] <haskl> i'm back!

[02:04:54] <Khaytsus> haskl: 
[02:05:17] <haskl> oh yeah i'm using znc of course you wouldn't get a message. i figured i setup a system that notifies people when my client disconnects
[02:05:19] <Khaytsus> A bit more than your departure, I didn't trim
[02:05:23] <haskl> i guess that' sjust the autoresponder
[02:05:34] <Khaytsus> haskl: You could do auto away on client exit

[02:06:05] <DarthGandalf> why wouldn't it
[02:08:08] <haskl> because i'm a bad sysadmin
[02:11:05] <haskl> Thanks for uploading the paste Khaytsus.
[02:11:20] <Khaytsus> Yep easy to do
[02:11:32] <haskl> I was wondering if there's a guide for configuring SASL with ZNC. Specifically I want to configure ZNC to connect to Libera through Tor.
[02:14:05] <torus> there are definitely some for Freenode and other than hidden service hostnames the process is the same

[11:53:02] <jiggawatt> cadabrax: so those are two different authentications
[11:53:05] <jiggawatt> your client -> znc
[11:53:11] <jiggawatt> and then znc -> the IRC server
[11:53:25] <jiggawatt> how have you setup authentication with the IRC server?
[11:53:51] <jiggawatt> i.e., did  you setup CertFP on IRC server?
