[14:21:23] <gtlsgamr> Hello evorybody
[14:21:42] <Arya[m]1> hi
[14:21:50] <NeoVoid[m]> hello
[14:21:59] <gtlsgamr> What are you fine folks doing today
[14:25:40] <NeoVoid[m]> coping with my mental health or fighting it or both and reading a book after very long time. I gotta learned to be focused more. I nowhere in my life due to undecisiveness. gotta meditiate.
[14:26:29] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: I am thinking
[14:27:21] <gtlsgamr> Do suryanamaskar every morning. It is worth it. Speaking from personal experience.
[14:27:24] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]: 
[14:27:30] <gtlsgamr> It helps focus
[14:29:35] <Abhi[m]> Technically speaking I am multimillionaire , I am 20 and crying for a girl that probably cheated and wasting my time , and I was thinking about what @BugsWriter said to be strong, god I can just buy people to work for me and fire them , I can buy whatever I want and have whatever I want . That's power why will I pretend , theirs no benifit except people disliking me , jokes on them I rather be real, it's like " ronge ham bc to Kya? Dil
[14:29:35] <Abhi[m]> tha pathar thodi hazar baar ronge " idk
[14:30:08] <Abhi[m]> This is maybe stupid
[14:31:04] <gtlsgamr> What does technically speaking mean?
[14:31:13] <Abhi[m]> But I feel better thinking like this . It's like yeah you can pretend to be strong but I am strong then people around me in reality but who cares about emotions ?
[14:31:23] <gtlsgamr> do you have multimillion dollaz?
[14:31:26] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: My company is valued at 50 crore
[14:31:46] <gtlsgamr> u own a company?
[14:31:47] <gtlsgamr> what company
[14:32:37] <Abhi[m]> It's like Jeff whole net worth is in amazon , but he has to publicly disclose it before selling the stocks , and if he sells everyone sells and and it dips and well he is not worth that much anymore so he is stuck
[14:33:06] <Abhi[m]> What's the diff between him and me ? He has some more spending power sure
[14:33:26] <Abhi[m]> I will get their am just 20 , can give myself some leeway here
[14:33:46] <Abhi[m]> Is this narsacistic
[14:34:35] <gtlsgamr> idk bro. it is nearly end of the year
[14:34:47] <gtlsgamr> i am working on my mango farm
[14:34:49] <gtlsgamr> life is good.
[14:35:02] <Abhi[m]> If I want I can cry in a stage xD , as a matter of fact I cried in public places before , because who cares ,
[14:35:14] <Abhi[m]> I just don't care if people think I am powerful or not
[14:35:34] <Arya[m]1> gtlsgamr: wow
[14:35:35] <Abhi[m]> Is this bad
[14:35:45] <Arya[m]1> oh yeah you live inside a forest
[14:35:52] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: I will buy a farm soon
[14:37:06] <gtlsgamr> Arya[m]1: Yes I do! Forests are nice. Bike rides in jungle are nicer
[14:37:42] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: Suggest a place
[14:37:45] <Abhi[m]> For vacation
[14:37:50] <Abhi[m]> Cheap , underrated
[14:38:35] <gtlsgamr> Abhi[m]: Come here
[14:38:37] <gtlsgamr> in Gir.
[14:38:43] <gtlsgamr> Underrated, cheap, quiet

[14:39:43] <Abhi[m]> Are you manipulative ?
[14:39:49] <Abhi[m]> Oh god

[14:40:50] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: Yeah send it will help
[14:42:39] <gtlsgamr> just a question.. if you are a multimillionaire, why dont u go to some greece or some shit
[14:42:43] <gtlsgamr> private cottages and shit
[14:43:55] <Abhi[m]> Because I don't have spending capital
[14:44:02] <Abhi[m]> I am poor technically
[14:44:08] <Abhi[m]> Everything in company
[14:44:18] <Abhi[m]> Net worth is that but spending power is bill
[14:44:28] <Abhi[m]> s/bill/nill/
[14:45:05] <Abhi[m]> I can't sell it , because I don't want too .
[14:45:18] <gtlsgamr> ah
[14:45:24] <Abhi[m]> Do you understand ?
[14:45:41] <Abhi[m]> <Abhi[m]> "It's like Jeff whole net worth..." <- Like this but low
[14:51:57] <Ankit[m]12> <Abhi[m]> "Like this but low" <- which company do you own?
[14:53:34] <Abhi[m]> I like to stay anon
[14:53:36] <Abhi[m]> Ahahaha
[14:53:41] <Abhi[m]> Ankit[m]12: It's a startup
[14:53:50] <Abhi[m]> Name has been stolen
[14:54:03] <Abhi[m]> So have to think of new name
[14:54:32] <Abhi[m]> But mental health fucked , need a vacation according to physiologist
[14:54:58] <Abhi[m]> I legit thought I had dpresskon
[14:55:05] <Abhi[m]> Or some form of mental thing
[14:55:13] <Ankit[m]12> Abhi[m]: IT startup?
[14:55:19] <Abhi[m]> Ankit[m]12: Yes
[14:55:23] <Abhi[m]> It's cringe
[14:55:28] <ramram[m]> Abhi[m]: wow then what happened?
[14:55:46] * ramram[m] uploaded a video: (126KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/68ca98c38ef68f3e10593ba199afc3eb6f0d1306/mp4.mp4 >
[14:55:47] <Abhi[m]> ramram[m]: Nothing I am fine just dressed out
[14:55:50] <Ankit[m]12> Abhi[m]: what was the idea of startup?
[14:55:50] <Abhi[m]> Need a vacation
[14:56:17] <Abhi[m]> Ankit[m]12: I have register it , and some ideas and name is already stolen
[14:56:23] <Abhi[m]> I will tell you in few months
[14:56:32] <Ankit[m]12> Abhi[m]: go to ujjan, you'll feel good
[14:56:40] <Abhi[m]> Or are you an investor in that case I can risk it
[14:56:50] <Abhi[m]> Did you know no one signs and nda to hear your pitch
[14:56:57] <Abhi[m]> They can legally take your ideas
[14:56:58] <Abhi[m]> Ans even your name
[14:57:02] <Ankit[m]12> Abhi[m]: i'm no investor just was curious
[14:57:19] <Abhi[m]> But if you don't tell them you don't get mkney
[14:57:24] <Abhi[m]> s/mkney/money/
[14:57:33] <Abhi[m]> It's pretty messy situtation
[15:33:35] <Arya[m]1> wait you live in gir
[15:33:37] <Arya[m]1> wow
[15:39:58] <Arya[m]1> how frequent are powercuts?
[15:40:23] <SurajKushwah[m]> <Abhi[m]> "Technically speaking I am..." <- we all get emotions
[15:40:23] <SurajKushwah[m]> we all get heart
[15:40:23] <SurajKushwah[m]> when our decisions come directly from emotions
[15:40:23] <SurajKushwah[m]> without any brain processing. it's impulsive decision it's bad. we all get duties, u might think u don't have but u still have. and we need to keep pushing no matter what.
[15:49:42] <SurajKushwah[m]> You can't control emotions but you can always control your actions. and emotions are STUPID. some people might say to make you feel better your emotions aren't stupid. .But tell me loving a girl who was a bitch ?? and u know it still loving her. that's is stupid. Emotions make a person stupid. Look at your emotions, recognize it. but don't let them trick you and act like idiot. be smart.
[15:51:30] <SurajKushwah[m]> <Abhi[m]> "Technically speaking I am..." <- and stop reading these stupid quotes, which make u feel better and allow u to do what u want to do.
[15:54:38] <Abhi[m]> Agreed
[16:05:58] <Ankit[m]12> <Abhi[m]> "Agreed" <- Aur agar startup karne ki socho to sabse pahle use govt se register karwa lo, tab kisi ke baap me dum nahi ki idea or startup chura le
[16:06:42] <Abhi[m]> Ankit[m]12: It's taking time
[16:06:43] <Abhi[m]> Processing
[16:07:16] <Ankit[m]12> Yeah, but your startup will be safe and secure from a cheater
[16:08:07] <Abhi[m]> No it's talking time to be register
[16:08:14] <Abhi[m]> I did that now
[16:08:28] <Ankit[m]12> Abhi[m]: Ohkay
[16:08:28] <Arya[m]> beauracracy

[19:59:56] <bugswriter> first small talk and then asking for morning people. 
[20:00:10] <bugswriter> this is a linux group.
[20:01:03] <bugswriter> hey, don't take me wrong, mera matlab tha. you can't find morning people here
[20:01:26] <bugswriter> not like "This is a linux group" so don't do these convo
[20:05:21] <klimi[m]> is it morning in india?
[20:05:27] <klimi[m]> i thought that evening...
[20:06:05] <NeoVoid[m]> no i was going to ask
[20:06:05] <NeoVoid[m]> why can't we sleep early and wake early?
[20:06:35] <NeoVoid[m]> whats that keeps us doing this way.
[20:08:51] <gtlsgamr> I sleep early when I can
[20:13:30] <bugswriter> @NeoVoid don't listen to gtlsgamr, he is a married man. he is not sigma. 
[20:13:50] <Abhi[m]> <bugswriter> "hey, don't take me wrong, mera..." <- I wake up at 5
[20:14:34] <klimi[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "whats that keeps us doing this..." <- depends on your age and cultural background and environment
[20:15:11] <bugswriter> we love dark nights
[20:15:40] <gtlsgamr> Early to bed and Early to rise, makes a man healthy wealthy and wise.

[20:16:26] <NeoVoid[m]> the marriage
[20:16:43] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: yes you are right
[20:17:09] <NeoVoid[m]> klimi[m]: the simple answer is tv and phone xr
[20:17:13] <NeoVoid[m]> s/xr/xd/
[20:18:13] <klimi[m]> not really
[20:18:24] <klimi[m]> it is a factor
[20:18:25] <klimi[m]> but
[20:18:36] <klimi[m]> you go to sleep eventually
[20:19:03] <klimi[m]> but blue light certainly is a factor
[20:19:06] <NeoVoid[m]> yes lots of blue Light
[20:19:16] <ramram[m]> turn on night light

[20:23:36] <klimi[m]> my parents wanted to get one for me because my sigh is turning out worse
[20:23:42] <NeoVoid[m]> they says glasses makes eyes worse if you keep using them
[20:24:04] <klimi[m]> i have lost the ability to focus at objects in the distance
[20:24:25] <NeoVoid[m]> klimi[m]: yes. It was painful. and they come with pain killers
[20:25:10] <NeoVoid[m]> klimi[m]: same problem. lots of screen staring causes that
[20:26:27] <NeoVoid[m]> i try to look at natural things at distance and it start to clear up
[20:27:28] <NeoVoid[m]> i bet with more practice and less screen staring it will go back to normal
[20:30:33] <klimi[m]> i hope
[20:30:44] <klimi[m]> i started to care more about my sight but... ye
[20:35:19] <Ankit[m]12> <gtlsgamr> "Early to bed and Early to rise..." <- Brahman Gyan

[20:48:28] <smud[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "i bet with more practice and..." <- I literally set up a pomodoro timer to follow the 20-20-20 rule lol
[20:49:45] <smud[m]> Redshift also seems to help
[21:10:37] <bugswriter> pomodoro is not a good idea, I mean .. when I do something I take break accordingly. Forcing yourself to do 20-20-20. is kind of weird. like what if u are doing something with complete focus and boom u need a break now.
