I need to rest a bit…) I have posted 4 more articles around the free software distributions whose text you helped me with. You can discover them at https://linuxvillage.org, it is the full presentation for each of them.

[04:50:23] <CuriosTiger> it's kind of like the word ajar. It's just a synonym for "open", but only very specific things can be ajar.
[04:51:17] <CuriosTiger> a door can be ajar. But not an application or a point of view. Or, to pick something more concrete, a patio.

[10:05:34] <pussipupu> amosbird: No but I'm also not sure what you're trying to say
[10:05:43] <pussipupu> Could you rephrase/elaborate
[10:06:23] <kerfluffy> pussipupu is 'to help' in a particular group of words that can take full or bare infinitives?
[10:06:32] <kerfluffy> is there a name for such a gropu?
[10:07:21] *** Joins: nimue (sid194105@id-194105.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[10:08:09] <pussipupu> Well, it's an auxiliary verb which is why it takes verbs in infinitive or participle form, but I'm not sure there's a term for that specific subcatagory
[10:09:10] <fdsdf> gerund, not participle
[10:09:22] <amosbird> pussipupu: I mean, the feature was landed eight months ago
[10:10:04] <pussipupu> Probably you want “landed” rather than “was landed”, but also that's more instantanious
[10:10:33] <pussipupu> “The feature has been available for eight months now.” should work well
[10:10:52] <amosbird> pussipupu: thank you

[10:11:25] <amosbird> What about this one
[10:11:40] <amosbird> I'd like to say it's time to make it production ready, with more efforts
[10:11:57] <pussipupu> “...effort to get it into a production-ready state.” would be better IMO

[14:56:18] <tinsoldier> denotation — Noun: 1. The act of denoting, or something (such as a symbol) that denotes, 2. (logic, linguistics, semiotics) The primary, surface, literal, or explicit meaning of a signifier such as a word, phrase, or symbol; that which a word denotes, as contrasted with its connotation; the aggregate or set of objects of which a word may be pred <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/denotation>...

[14:57:38] <Me-me> That would mean that they would get information about you, as opposed to you getting information about something else.

[14:59:39] <Me-me> You don't give acknowledgement to someone about something else. You can inform them about it. That can then make them acknowledge it.
[15:00:08] <Me-me> If I acknowledge an orange, then inform someone about that orange, they might acknowledge the orange. But I cannot acknowledge an orange on their behalf, because that's just me acknowledging it.
[15:00:39] <spinningCat> ha okay
[15:01:31] <spinningCat> it is like let know someone about something
[15:01:43] <Me-me> "Informing" is, yes.

[15:12:04] <Me-me> GuiToris: I can't really comment on relationship advice. That's not really a function of the language, at least not syntactically. It will depend on the cultural and social context. It's about your relationship with the person. It's about your communication, and how you and they frame the request in your mind. This is true for all romantic and sexual advances, and indeed in all languages. If I gave you any definitive answer at all, it would be incorrect

[19:39:29] <lall-> I heard people wording it both ways. Not sure which one is more proper though.
[19:40:25] <CuriosTiger> The second is usually what teachers look for, because they want case agreement.

[19:41:11] <CuriosTiger> But this smacks of the kind of "question" that's cooked up more for standardized tests than for actual communication.
[19:42:39] <CuriosTiger> pk: No. It's relatively common to use simpler cases (as in, fewer auxiliary verbs) in conversation. And the other "error" I can imagine there would be that it should arguably be subjunctive, ie "If I were not the son of a politician.."

[21:27:50] <tinsoldier> Mincemeat is a mixture of chopped dried fruit, distilled spirits and spices, and often beef suet, usually used as a pie or pastry filling. Mincemeat formerly contained meat, notably beef or venison. Many modern recipes replace the suet with vegetable shortening. Mincemeat is found in the Anglosphere. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincemeat

[21:35:06] <CuriosTiger> Tinnitus is hearing damage. It's common in people who have been exposed to excessively loud noise over time.

[21:59:18] <noord> it is not shuffling
[21:59:26] <CuriosTiger> Indeed. It is omission.

[22:00:33] <CuriosTiger> Providing the letters also gives you the length of the word, and certainly, your brain is capable of sorting out a few letters out of order. But too much and reading becomes a chore. If you try hard enough, you can create a puzzle that is quite difficult to parse.
[22:00:57] <CuriosTiger> So, some truth to it, I b*t y*u c*n r*d t*s.

[22:01:59] <chat> CuriosTiger meant to say: "but I challenge everyone to parse this sentence correctly, let alone at a normal reading pace."
[22:02:57] <pussipupu> changing the word lengths by rebreaking the words goes against the idea though
[22:03:35] <CuriosTiger> I think it just takes it to another level. :)
[22:04:01] <noord> CuriosTiger: brain is pattern matching device, it fills ambiguities either correct or not
[22:04:04] <CuriosTiger> but of course, word length provides a hint. And providing the actual letters merely shuffled even more so.

[22:06:56] <huf> if you cover up the upper half of a line of text, you can still read it
[22:07:00] <huf> if you cover up the lower half, same
[22:07:05] <huf> so what do you even need the letters for? :D
