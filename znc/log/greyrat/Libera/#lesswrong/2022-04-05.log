[00:01:17] <adiabatic> 'mercurial' sounds like a good name
[00:02:09] <feep> or gremlin core? since, well, demon core is taken
[00:02:17] <dTal> beasty core
[00:02:21] <feep> hee
[00:02:48] <dTal> these all sound like musical genres
[00:03:01] <feep> though if you call it a demon core, you could genuinely have a physical scenario where demon cores (radioactive) cause demon cores (processor)
[00:03:08] <feep> which would be very appropriate
[00:03:40] <feep> though the ultimate outcome would be if the demon core then miscomputes a nuclear experiment, creating another demon core of the first kind
[00:03:55] <feep> thus completing the reaction
[00:06:06] <two2thehead> hm 'We are using an example product computation of 3 times 5 to demonstrate our observations:
[00:06:07] <two2thehead> '• Data randomization: We observe that the corruptions are data dependent by nature. For example, we observe numer- ous instances where the majority of the computations would be fine within a corrupt CPU but a smaller subset would always produce faulty computations due to certain bit pat- tern representation. For example, we may observe that 3 times 5 is 15, but 3 times 4 is evaluated to 10, and thus until and unless 3 times 4 is verifie
[00:06:07] <two2thehead> d specifically, we cannot confirm computation accuracy within the device for that specific computation. This leads to a fairly large state space for testing'
[00:07:55] <gwern> yes, that was in their earlier papers: buggy devices can be *consistently* buggy, the worse possible way
[00:08:28] <two2thehead> gwern, interesting (.__.)?
[00:08:31] <two2thehead> 'Lifecycle variations: We observe that silicon continually changes in performance and reliability with time. This has been well documented in bathtub curve failure modeling across the literature [18 ], [24], [23 ]. However, with silent data corruptions we observe that certain failures can man- ifest earlier than the traditional bathtub curve predictions based on device usage. As a result, a computation produc- ing a correct result today provides no 
[00:08:31] <two2thehead> guarantee that the computation will produce a correct result tomorrow. In one specific experiment, we repeated the exact same computa- tion sequence on the device once every day for a period of 6 months and the device failed after 6 months indicating degradation with time for that computation. In essence, a computation like 3 times 5 equals 15 can provide a correct result today but tomorrow may result in 3 times 5 being evaluated to an incorrect 
[00:08:32] <two2thehead> value'
[00:08:53] * gwern shudders. if you think missing a +1 is bad...
[00:09:15] <two2thehead> lol
[00:09:18] <two2thehead> yeah, point
[00:10:48] <gwern> these are the devices which you hope never to run into because they will cost you several sanity points as you debug the rest of the stack where the bug is almost always, and it takes herculean efforts to prove it's the hardware
[00:11:37] <two2thehead> i presume you read the earlier bit about humidity and temperature affecting hardware in wonky ways?
[00:11:46] <two2thehead> Imagine having to duplicate *that* bug
[00:11:54] <feep> eh, I feel that's doable
[00:12:03] <feep> have a look at the server, notice the air is a bit moist
[00:12:30] <two2thehead> sure, at meta or other faang companies
[00:12:35] <feep> if you can realize problems from dust, I think you can realize problems from moisture
[00:12:39] <gwern> 'have a look' at the server may not be too feasible if you're a FB engineer chilling remote on the beach in the bahamas troubleshooting a server in a mega-datacenter in taiwan
[00:12:44] <two2thehead> now imagine having that bug in say a small business
[00:12:55] <feep> as gwern notes, I think that's *easier* in a small business
[00:13:14] <feep> gwern: that said if the mega-datacenter is not mandating climate control you're asking for it.
[00:13:26] <two2thehead> my prior is that middle management types are not very understanding about compsci
[00:13:36] <two2thehead> it depends on a lot of variables
[00:13:40] <feep> sure, but if the datacenter is in the same building you can just go look
[00:13:49] <two2thehead> that's true
[00:14:08] <gwern> feep: sure but they already control all these things, so the humidity variations are either so localized your monitoring doesn't record it or it's within what you think is safe irrelevant range (after all, the other 99.999% of servers are all fine!)
[00:14:22] <feep> fair enough
[00:14:41] <feep> I feel bit optimistic about "they already control all these things", considering what we've learnt about ovh for instance

[00:30:31] <gwern> https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16491023743294398.png hm. this feels rather different from what I expected. is this the consequence of the link icon work being so thorough now?
[00:30:32] <Robomot> image/png (2160x3839; 1.5 MB)
[00:30:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Y...yes?
[00:31:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean my thought was "boy that deepmind icon really needs to settle down"
[00:31:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> We gotta scale it down a bit and dial back the opacity too
[00:31:29] <gwern> like, I always hated the idea of making annotation=WP, the point of making WP the faint dotted underline was to de-emphasize them and prioritize annotations. if you made them the same, annotations would be cast into the outer darkness and be ignored
[00:31:57] <gwern> but, well, now that so much have link icons, that just doesn't happen here
[00:32:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[00:32:12] <gwern> you've either got a PDF icon, or a DM or FB or...
[00:32:42] <gwern> and then the WP ones like 'Common Crawl' or 'self-supervised learning' are indeed de-emphasized
[00:32:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[00:33:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I think this does indeed both reduce clutter and retain the distinction between "annotation popup" and "content popup"

Basically, the point I am trying to make is that these models are now, at least on the surface, cheap enough for regular organizations to pay for if they were
[05:37:16] <feepbot> so inclined. If we take away from the paper the idea that PaLM beat human-average on the litany of tasks in BIG, it begs to reasons that with modern hardware, software, and understanding some organization must only spend between $30-$300 million (and gather VERY extensive training data) to produce a LLM capable of exceeding the human average at minimum, and likely reaching the
[05:37:16] <feepbot> upper quartiles (or more) at maximum. It is now the case that a machine learning model representing the generalized logical capacity of the smartest humans can very likely be produced for less than it costs to market a new brand of soda to a nation, build one building, or send a few hundred students to a 4-year degree program.

Subsequent research suggests a more complex picture, with preference dependent on physical and cultural factors: handedness, and whether one
[06:12:05] <feepbot> reads/writes left-to-right or right-to-left (see Palmer, Gardner, & Wickens 2008 for references and discussion; Chahboun et al. 2017 found some limited support for the idea that placement preference depends on the subject’s direction of reading/writing). Other studies have shown robust preferences for certain colours (Palmer & Schloss 2010), shapes, positioning of objects within
[06:12:05] <feepbot> a frame (Palmer, Gardner, & Wickens 2008) and size (Linsen, Leyssen, Sammartino, & Palmer 2011). These preferences often turn out to be ecologically driven; for example, people tend to like the colours of liked objects, with strong and culturally invariant liking of saturated blue and invariant hostility to colours associated with faeces and vomit. There are cultural variations;
[06:12:10] <feepbot> for example Japanese subjects appear to be unusual in their lack of enthusiasm for dark red (Palmer & Schloss 2010). Some colour preferences are very culturally specific, as with the preferences of college students for colours associated with their schools (Schloss, Poggesi, & Palmer 2011).' https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetics-cogsci/ the japanese don't like dark red?

[11:40:35] <nshepperd2> would be nice to salvage the data of it
[11:41:31] <adiabatic> did you have its contents backed up

[11:49:45] <adiabatic> Are you running Linux or some other "you're probably on a server, use B2" OS?
[11:49:59] <nshepperd2> it's mainly how long it takes things to upload/download with shitty australian internet

[11:51:19] <dbohdan[phone]> On Linux ZFS snapshots are a nice way to do full partition incremental backups

[12:07:51] <feep[work]> okay, the next two papers between here and the end of the world:
[12:08:07] <feep[work]> 1. Training Transformers with Hidden Chains of Reasoning
[12:08:29] <feep[work]> 2. Inside-Out: Self-Guided Training using Hidden Mode by Default.
[12:09:01] <feep[work]> there is no 3, because 2 is the singularity.
[12:09:13] <ardent[m]> what about Training General Intelligences for Metaverse Environment Generation?
[12:09:33] <feep[work]> nah, that's not gonna be a paper, that's just going to be "I asked God to make me an environment."
[12:09:59] <feep[work]> if 3 was a paper, it would maybe have been "Augmenting AI capabilities with self-generated Python scripts", but that foomed.
[12:10:10] <ardent[m]> "I asked God to give me the experience of being smol and cuddly"

[12:12:41] <PapuaHardyNet> "scaling goes harder than we thought"? By that you mean the benefits keeping going up? yeah I read that paper
[12:13:08] <PapuaHardyNet> fun fact, we only need 2 billion USD to rent enough compute to train a 100 trillion parameters language model today

[12:15:56] <feep[work]> we're in exactly the multipolar fuckhole that we were kinda hoping to avoid

[12:16:52] <dbohdan[phone]> I wonder if the US military or some TLA already have advances in ML they keep quiet about it like they have in cryptography
[12:17:11] <PapuaHardyNet> you mean "I dunno if pressing this nuke test button will burn the earth or not but fuck it let's go" Manhattan 2.0?
[12:17:20] <ardent[m]> in the ideal world Elon would train and release the trillion chinchilla, waifu edition
[12:17:23] <feep[work]> I mean, yes
[12:17:42] <feep[work]> but still better than "if we don't nuke baidu they'll nuke us" cold war 2.0
[12:18:21] <PapuaHardyNet> true. But you do know that any hint or sign that baidu is that important, geopolitically speaking, means China will redirect its efforts to achieving AGI?
[12:18:49] <PapuaHardyNet> they already plan to invest 15 billion USD per year in AI research (this money comes from the state, at least)
[12:19:19] <feep[work]> "In a just and perfect world", china don't want to end up in a race with deepmind either.

[12:25:20] <dbohdan[phone]> Obormot\Arcturus: Thanks!
[12:29:21] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't help instill confidence that some of the figures they used to verify that it wouldn't ignite the atmosphere turned out to be wrong by a similar amount as the margin of safety, but fortunately in the safer direction.
[12:30:43] <PlanckWalk> Err, as in reality turned out to be safer than they thought, by a lot more than they estimated.  For all they knew it could have been unsafer.
[12:32:31] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: not much
[12:32:46] <feep[work]> that's already the level I was expecting things to go
[12:33:05] <feep[work]> all hope now has the form of "make deepmind more cautious", the AI safety agenda has been dead for a while.
[12:33:26] <feep[work]> things are simply going too fast.

[12:34:54] <PlanckWalk> This is definitely the "I would like to leave the building now, there is a fire"  "What do you mean, the doors are locked and barred?"
[12:35:00] <PlanckWalk> moment.

[18:09:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reading between the lines real hard makes it seem like it's very skewed in favor of afab though
[18:10:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which lends support to the theory that mtf and ftm are fundamentally different phenomena, though we call them both "trans" and treat them the same way etc.

[18:29:39] <Robomot> Justice Stevens reads the fine print: Matthew Butterick
[18:31:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... aw goddamnit Butterick
[18:32:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I sent him the code to strip soft hyphens on copy, and he dutifully added it to his typography book site, but ... not his other sites apparently
[18:32:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know what I oughta do, I should make a browser extension that does this.
[18:34:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Justice John Paul Stevens, however, was not persuaded. He filed a dissent. What was his leading objection? The typography of the ticket:
[18:34:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> > The [majority opinion] prefaces its legal analysis with a factual statement that implies that a purchaser of a Carnival Cruise Lines passenger ticket is fully and fairly notified about the existence of the choice of forum clause … only the most meticulous passenger is likely to become aware of the forum-selection provision. I have therefore appended to this opinion a facsimile of the relevant text, using the type size that
[18:34:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  actually appears in the ticket itself.
[18:34:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> And so we arrive at one of the greatest flexes ever by an Article III judge. If you visit a law library, get volume 499 of the United States Reports from the shelf, and open the back cover, you will find the reproduction of the Carnival ticket—actual size, accurately folded—that has since been glued into every copy by order of Justice Stevens."
[18:34:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Was this necessary to make the point? No. Was it arguably a snippy and expensive gesture for a dissent? Perhaps. Nevertheless, I salute Justice Stevens for his empathetic cri de coeur against the lawyerly abuse of fine print."
[18:35:19] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: the theory for mtf gender dysphoria that i find most likely is that an excess of estrone in the womb causes a lot of SHBG to be generated, which binds to testosterone and prevents the masculinization of the brain in utero
[18:35:32] <nshepperd2> obviously the cause for ftm has to be different
[18:35:47] <nshepperd2> maybe excess testosterone from the mothers adrenal gland or something
[18:36:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is SHBG
[18:36:20] <nshepperd2> sex hormone binding globulin
[18:36:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> ah
[18:36:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[18:36:45] <nshepperd2> just another negative feedback system the body has to keep things homeostatic basically
[18:36:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah that certainly sounds like the sort of thing that can easily be very asymmetric
[18:37:13] <nshepperd2> yeah
[18:37:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> That having been said, I'm not sure it explains the differential rates of *de*-trans (it could explain it, but not ... obviously)
[18:38:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess you'd have to add some sort of age-related effects to that model
[18:38:47] <nshepperd2> yeah i don't know
[18:38:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then if you subtract out "social-only" ftm transitioners (as a rough approximation of factoring out "social contagion" effects) then you might get the rate difference?
[18:39:16] <nshepperd2> maybe because the adrenal gland can't generate that much it's more like to be 'partial'
[18:39:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyhow it's def. obvious that this is very under-investigated
[18:40:27] <pompolic> what changes fall under "masculinization of the brain"?
[18:41:01] <nshepperd2> shit we don't understand, probably
[18:41:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Whatever makes someone a shape rotator >_>
[18:41:38] <pompolic> lmao
[18:42:02] <pompolic> yeah i was asking because it sounded like it should be a whole thing, but i am completely ignorant
[18:43:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's clearly lots of stuff, but as far as I'm aware we know a lot more about that "lots of stuff"'s effects on cognition and such than we do about the neurological development aspect of it
[18:43:18] <nshepperd2> like what we observe is different parts getting bigger or smaller, on average
[18:43:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> The cognition effects are so clear as to be undeniable, though
[18:43:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Statistically speaking)
[18:43:52] <nshepperd2> right
[18:46:01] <nshepperd2> i assume there's a whole like, hormonal activation of different parts of the genome
[18:51:01] <feepbot> <gwern> 'I work at Google. DeepMind doesn't tell us shit. We know more about what's going on at OpenAI than DeepMind. We learned about that paper from Twitter.'
[18:51:34] <feep> well, that's a good sign I guess
[18:51:44] <two2thehead> yep
[18:52:10] <dbohdan[phone]> An interesting candidate for the cause of being MtF trans is partial testosterone insensitivity. According to Dr. William Powers (who is pretty controversial) his MtF patients often have one of more mutations known to reduce sensitivity to testosterone. They are on average taller than the average man because of it (like eunuchs were taller because of their lower testosterone). So being trans may be caused by a cluster of 
[18:52:10] <dbohdan[phone]> conditions with similar effects (that stack?).
[18:53:56] <dbohdan[phone]> He doesn't seem to think it is just one type of condition that causes it, though
[18:54:03] <PapuaHardyNet> hold on, what?
[18:54:57] <PapuaHardyNet> "Men with estrogen deficiency caused by a mutation in the CYP19 gene suffer from low BMD, unfused epiphyses, and have high gonadotropin and testosterone levels." https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31644163/
[18:55:04] <Robomot> Gonadotropins - PubMed (The gonadotropins are peptide hormones that regulate ovarian and testicular function and are essential for normal growth, sexual development and reproduction. The human gonadotropins include follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) which are made in the pituitary, and chorioni …)
[18:55:21] <PapuaHardyNet> low testosterone should not necessarily lead to someone being taller than average.
[18:58:17] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: it's because a high level of sex hormones (either testosterone or estrogen, in either gender) basically signals the end of puberty, causing a growth spurt followed by closure of the growth plates at the ends of your bones
[18:58:29] <PapuaHardyNet> okay this is strange -- low testosterone also prevents epyphysal closure. both low T and low E results in unfused epiphyses
[18:58:40] <nshepperd2> so if your effective levels are lower, it basically extends puberty
[18:58:46] <nshepperd2> and you grow for longer
[18:58:49] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: huh, I see.
[18:58:59] <feep> interesting!

[20:28:28] <gwern> it may run just fine at a small scale (where everything is so dumb you can't tell, or the error causes the curves to cross)
[20:28:48] <two2thehead> dbohdan[phone], lol
[20:29:03] <gurkenglas> can you estimate this exponent by running at a variety of small scales?
[20:30:03] <gwern> no, not really. you need runs at larger scales to even begin to estimate it. like in kaplan, you still need to do a few runs at billions of parameters, you can't just do a whole bunch of runs in the low thousands/millions and estimate
[20:30:19] <gurkenglas> ok :c

[22:28:11] <Robomot> Models who are 'too beautiful' to find love unite to whine (A growing number of models and social media influencers claim they are being penalized for being "too beautiful," resulting in them repeatedly getting rejected from dating apps amid accusations of catfishing and "intimidating dates.")

[22:43:25] <Robomot> Germany closes Russian darknet market Hydra | News | DW | 05.04.2022 (Federal police say they have shut down the German servers for the darknet hub, which saw its sales skyrocket during the pandemic.)
[22:44:48] <rmmh> ...hail hydra?
[22:46:02] <gwern> I don't think they're going to grow back stronger
[22:46:23] <dbohdan[phone]> Would they have done it without the war?
[22:46:44] <rmmh> I doubt darknet raids have anything to do with wars
[22:47:35] <gwern> hard to say. there's often a lot of backstory to these things
[22:48:02] <gwern> I mean, look at the silk road backstory. even if you thought you had estimated how wild and complicated the backstory was, you were off by orders of magnitude in drama and lulz
[22:48:28] <rmmh> the desire to talk to other people in the forum, the eternal downfall of humanity

[22:52:03] <gwern> there have already been some but they're dumb and pro-police
[22:52:19] <gwern> because they were licensed from a journalist who just regurgiated police info
[22:52:37] <gwern> apparently it's standard in hollywood to license specific takes on real-world events to avoid trouble
[22:56:14] <dbohdan[phone]> Oh, I've totally missed this: https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7937254/. It is rated 6/10 and doesn't look exciting like _The Social Network_ did.
[22:56:15] <Robomot> Silk Road (2021) - IMDb (Silk Road: Directed by Tiller Russell. With Nick Robinson, Jennifer Yun, Jimmi Simpson, Jason Clarke. Philosophical twenty-something Ross Ulbricht creates Silk Road, a dark net website that sells drugs, while DEA agent Rick Bowden goes undercover to bring him down.)
[22:56:52] <dbohdan[phone]> It's a shame, because it means nobody will do it right -- at least for a while
