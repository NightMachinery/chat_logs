[02:37:19] <gohlzehn> Hi. So I have this question about x = pi/3 for the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x) which can be solved like so: -sin(x) * 2 = -2sin(x) = -2sin(pi/3) = -2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3), but I don't understand the first part where cos(2x) becomes -sin(x) * 2 where the 2x becomes x...
[02:38:04] <gohlzehn> I understand that cos() becomes -sin() and then times the derivative of 2x, but how come it is not -sin(2x) * 2 ?

[02:44:33] <twJizhan> I notice Zulip chat because the Lean theorem prover has their official chat on Zulip
[02:44:51] <gohlzehn> Z-module: well yesterday I asked this question as well and someone calculated it in a way where he still had: -sin(2*(pi/3)) which became -sin(sqrt(3)/2) iirc, but I don't understand how the 2 in 2x disappears here.. can you explain?

[07:28:51] <Cera> If S is a subset of T which are both subsets (not proper) of the polynomial ring k[x_1, ..., x_n], k a field, then their varieties are supposed to be inclusion-reversing: V(S) contains V(T). I want a simple example. So consider just one variable: k[x].  Suppose S = {x} and T = {x^2 - 1, x}. V(S) = {0} and V(T) = {1,-1,0}. But V(S) does not contain

[09:36:20] <tsujp> Maths friends, I'm looking for the name (if any, but I am sure there is) of this general principal/rule/law. If N things constitute some body, and the body is in some state then these N constituent things are therefore also in this state. E.g. `A + B = C` and `C` is "approved" or "in a good state" or "ok" then `A` and `B`, because they comprise
[09:36:20] <tsujp> `C`, are also in this "good state"
[09:36:46] <tsujp> I don't think I can specify it more formally than this otherwise I'd know the _thing_ I am seeking the answer for here. Happy to try and re-explain with a better example concrete or otherwise
[09:37:42] <tsujp> A + B = C is probably the wrong notation this is more like a set, { A, B } = C. "C is comprised of A and B" not addition like 1+2=3

[09:44:23] <somiaj> tsujp: I'd probably use an n-tuple
[09:44:49] <somiaj> tsujp: which is just a list of n things (a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n)
[09:45:15] <somiaj> You can make those thing what ever you want. If you just want some toggle, let a_i be either 0 or 1 to state it has the property a_i
[09:45:29] <tsujp> less so data structure and more so is there a law or axiom or something for this? Kind of like prepositional logic or discrete maths (if I am using the latter correctly). Like, if A = B and B = C then A = C. This is a known law or _thing_ right, is there a similar one for my example?
[09:45:30] <somiaj> in programing they call these arrays or lists
[09:46:03] <somiaj> I really don't know what your thing is, until you give it some actual rules, you can't start to describe what propertieis it has
[09:46:49] <somiaj> You just said a body is some sate of n-things, so this to me says each of your bodies is an n-tuple, listing the n-things that make it up. Outside of that you haven't said much I can follow about other things you want.
[09:47:24] <tsujp> Okay so the context is there is a PR on Github. If you're unaware a PR on Github a Git patch which consists of a number of files. PRs can be "Approved". So, if the PR is "Approved" and PRs consist of N files, then an approval of the PR (this singular "thing") means that each constituent file is therefore also approved by virtue of the fact these
[09:47:24] <tsujp> constituent files comprise the PR.
[09:48:43] <somiaj> Yes, I know what a PR is, it is a diff on a source tree. Still don't quite get what you are getting at.
[09:48:54] <tsujp> I'm trying to figure out if there is a formal description for this type of obvious logic. Another example I know the name of is the Transitive Law. The Transitive Law states if A is equal to B, and B is equal to C then A is equal to C. Is there such a law or name for the thing I am describing akin to the transitive law?
[09:49:26] <somiaj> well transitivity is about relations, and applies to more than just equality, less than and greater than are also transitive, so is subset.

[09:50:18] <tsujp> Subset ey.. if I have a set { A, B } is that same set { A, B } also a subset? Like, { A } is and { B } is and empty set is (I think) {} but is a set it's own subset?
[09:50:29] <tsujp> If that's true the transitivity law is the thing I'm looking for?
[09:50:50] <somiaj> No that is not what subset is
[09:51:02] <somiaj> A subset B means if x in A, then x in B.
[09:51:12] <tsujp> Oh right
[09:51:20] <tsujp> Right right because transitivity
[09:51:27] <somiaj> No, that isn't transitivity
[09:51:36] <somiaj> transitivity is if A subset B and B subset C, then A subset C
[09:52:04] <somiaj> in general a relation R is transitive of aRb and bRc then aRc, where (aRb means a is related to b)
[09:52:44] <tsujp> Okay, so this sounds like it be more commutative then
[09:53:26] <PlanckWalk> Maybe reflexive?  I.e. every set is a subset of itself
[09:53:34] <PlanckWalk> (which is true)
[09:54:22] <PlanckWalk> I.e. the subset relation is reflexive.
[09:54:49] <PlanckWalk> (It's also antisymmetric and transitive)
[09:55:01] <somiaj> tsujp: commutative is a property of a relation, but doesn't define a realtion. If you have a relation you can then ask what properities it has. But you have to have a relation first.
[09:55:54] <somiaj> subset is a relation that is defined by A subset B means if x in A then x in B. From this definition you can check to see if it is transitive, symmetric, reflexive, and a few others.

[17:41:53] <Z-module> I dunno, ||A - B||  for some appropriate matrix norm ||.|| ?
[17:42:56] <drvanon> Like for translations it would be very easy: you can take the norm of the difference of two translation vectors. For rotations it becomes more complicated, because of gimbal lock etc. (though I am not sure that that applies to rotation matrices as well.) But when it comes to complete transformation matrices I am kind of lost...
[17:43:20] <bildramer> what sort of transformation? if this is about computer graphics, you're either dealing with quaternions or homogeneous coordinates, I bet

[17:46:59] <drvanon> I love math and mathematician, but they really need to get in touch with some web designers.
[17:47:05] <bildramer> I don't know what your matrices are, but if it's quaternions, it's possible that a rotation and its opposite (in a quaternionic sense) have lower norm than rotations inbetween, for example
[17:47:07] <Decker> it's just the diagonal magnitude and the outside corners define the direction
[17:47:42] <Decker> drvanon the offset is one column, the orientation is the remaining 3x3 matrix
[17:47:44] <bildramer> so e.g. rotating 350 degrees could be more similar than rotating 20? maybe?
[17:48:07] <Decker> it's only good for +/- 180

[18:07:26] <Decker> not really :) but rotation vectors are close... if you could apply the delta vector as a torque at t0 you'd end up at the target
[18:08:08] <bildramer> as long as you don't have any scaling, then do this: 1. starting with matrices A and B, chop off the top left 3x3, say C and D, and keep the translation vectors, calculate the distance between them, get magnitude, multiply by constant 2. calculate C * D^T, get the angle, add to the result of 1
[18:08:19] <Decker> https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/3d/indexRelative.html  compares differences of rotations... and tries to plot the differences

[18:08:54] <bildramer> that is, C * D^T is a rotation matrix, and interpreted as axis-angle, get that angle (trace = 1 + 2cos(theta))
[18:09:23] <drvanon> bildramer, that sounds interesting. What is your basis for this procedure?
[18:10:01] <bildramer> if the matrices are all approximate, like with 1e-9 errors, that should still work. if it's 1e-3 errors, I'm unsure what the best solution is
[18:11:05] <bildramer> my basis is first separating translation and rotation, then I looked up how people usually deal with "distance between rotations" and found http://www.boris-belousov.net/2016/12/01/quat-dist/

[18:12:47] <Decker> you can go the extr step back to angles though... the sin(theta) scaling in the i,j,k components delinearizes them
[18:12:59] <Decker> but 0.5 seems to work a lot
[18:13:02] <bildramer> I also found https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/dynopt/readings/Rmetric.pdf but it's too long to skim

[18:13:39] <bildramer> probably exactly the paper you need if you want to do this hyper rigorously for some reason, though
[18:13:41] <drvanon> Ooh, that paper sounds promisign!
[18:14:20] <drvanon> bildramer, technically I don't need to be hyper rigorous, but this the second time I came across this problem now and I live for rigorous.
[18:14:31] <bildramer> anyway my intuition for why splitting the matrix first is justified is basically "scaling affects the translation but not the rotation, and intuitively scaling everything 2x shouldn't affect similarity"

[18:15:05] <bildramer> heh, what it taught me is that trains aren't on time as often as one might have thought
[18:15:16] <drvanon> Hhahahaa
[18:15:40] <Decker> and points are rotated based on their position, not the matrix's position... so if they are far from the origin they get scaled far... but that's about the points not the matrix
[18:15:56] <Decker> the matrix actually breaks down into 3 direction vectors for where the x Y and Z axis end up pointing
[18:16:22] <Decker> if you transform (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1) all the zeros make a lot of terms go away and it's more obvious it's just col1 col2 and col3

[18:30:26] <drvanon> I think I conceptually have some useful stuff: right now, some component of "moving" happens by rotating and then some other part happens by translation, however if I move the mesh to the origin, then the rotation component affects the translation in a much smaller degree. Then separating orientation and translation like bildramer said makes much
[18:30:27] <drvanon> more sense.

[21:13:09] <Pollion> Ok ok.
[21:13:23] <Pollion> Well anyway, does it answer your question ?
[21:13:42] <Pollion> Or are you still confused with x^2 = x+1 in your ring ?
[21:14:08] <Pollion> Or x^2 + I = (x+1) + I if you want
[21:15:25] <cadmio> well, now I understand that x^2 = x+1 means that these are elements of the same equivalence class
[21:16:13] <cadmio> I should say they represent the same class of the field Z_2[x]/..
[21:16:45] <Pollion>  well, you don't need it to be a field to say that, but it is indeed a field (beacause x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible)

[21:27:48] <cadmio> just to have understood the notation is a step forward
[21:28:09] <Pollion> pyzozord: the second
[21:28:51] <pyzozord> Pollion: then I don't see it
[21:29:13] <cadmio> so the equality shoul follow from the fact that the poly x^2 and x +1 are the same in Z_2[x] ?

[21:31:15] <pyzozord> oh sorry the simplificatoin will not be λz.z, it will be λx.λy.λz.z
[21:31:16] <cadmio> ah right by def it means that x^2 - (x+1) is in (x^2+x+1), right?
[21:31:30] <Pollion> cadmio: yes, exactly
[21:31:45] <Pollion> pyzozord: Yes, but you apply it on x y
[21:31:54] <Pollion> therefore it is indeed λz.z
[21:32:02] <pyzozord> oh ok, then I was right
[21:32:06] <Pollion> Yes
[21:32:12] <Pollion> but you seemed confused :)
[21:32:21] <pyzozord> a little bit, thanks for helping me throught
[21:32:55] <pyzozord> what's confusing is, why write such complex and pointless expression if instead of writing the simplest form
[21:33:04] <pyzozord> that's an example from the wiki page
[21:33:07] <cadmio> x^2 - (x+1) is exactly x^2 + x + 1 since 1 = -1 in Z_2
[21:33:24] <Pollion> About your first expression, it depends on what you can use. I mean in the end of the day lambda calculus is another form of computation (If you talk about pure lambda calculus).
[21:33:46] <Pollion> In pure lambda calculus, technically you don't have integers, but there are many ways to define them of course.
[21:34:10] <Pollion> If you are allowed integers then yes, this should be a valid expression.
[21:34:14] <pyzozord> ah, right + is a big shortcat that supposedly can be made with lambda calculus expressions
[21:34:31] <Pollion> Yes, you can pretty much define everything

[21:34:41] <Pollion> but it will get very messy really really fast
[21:35:03] <Pollion> even church definition of integers is a little bit complicated.
[21:35:26] <Pollion> cadmio: This is another way of writing the euclidean division of x^2 by x^2+x+1
[21:35:26] <pyzozord> and it all comes from λx.λy.x and λx.λy.y right? because those are like conditions
[21:35:37] <Pollion> x^2 = x^2+x+1 + (x+1)
[21:37:41] <Pollion> pyzozord: Those are projections: (x, y) |-> x and (x, y) |-> y.
[21:38:00] <Pollion> But you can define the boolean true to be λx.λy.x
[21:38:13] <Pollion> and false to be the other one
[21:38:21] <pyzozord> "projections"?
[21:38:38] <Pollion> By projection I mean exactly the maps I defined.
[21:38:47] <Pollion> You forget one component
[21:38:53] <Pollion> ie you project on the other one
[21:39:15] <Pollion> it is a standard name for those maps, but forget it if you are confused.
[21:40:00] <pyzozord> oh I see, they are just popular idiomatic epxressions named "projections", right?
[21:40:15] <Pollion> Yes
[21:40:24] <pyzozord> I understand, thanks

[21:49:51] <Pollion> In the beginning of this wikipedia article, there is no reduction yet.

[21:52:12] <Pollion> By definition, this is the set of all possible remaiders modulo x^2+x+1. You need to make the parallel with Z/5Z being all the possible remainders modulo 5, for instance.
[21:52:34] <Pollion> Now, take _any_ polynomial P(X) in the big ring.
[21:52:59] <Pollion> The euclidean division of P(x) by x^2+x+1 is
[21:53:20] <Pollion> P(x) = q(x)*(x^2+x+1) + r(x) with deg(r) < 2.
[21:53:23] <Pollion> right ?
[21:53:54] <cadmio> yes
[21:54:23] <Pollion> Since deg(r) < 2, deg(r) = 0 (ie r(x) = constant) or deg(r) = 1 (ie r(x) = ax+b).
[21:54:48] <Pollion> This can be written as r(x) = ax+b, a, b \in Z/2Z
[21:55:09] <Pollion> This is the form of all elements in your ring.
[21:55:26] <Pollion> But you need to remember reduction rules to make computations
[21:55:43] <Pollion> The only one that matters is x^2+x+1 = 0
[21:55:49] <Pollion> (in the quotient ring)
[21:55:55] <Pollion> ie, x^2 = x+1
[21:56:46] <cadmio> so deg(r) dependes on the choice of q(x)
[21:56:56] <Pollion> No
[21:57:00] <Pollion> it depends on x^2+x+1
