[01:45:57] <emmeka> this dude named Alfred Kinsey in like the 1940s did a whole huge study of sexuality, he ranked people on a scale from 0 to 6, 0 being "totally straight" and 6 being "totally gay"

[01:47:55] *** Quits: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:48:05] <emmeka> brainwash the reason I mention this is that 1) in Kinsey's findings, there's actually less bisexual women than bisexual men 2) bisexuality was, in his reports, actually reasonably rare, generally no more common in all its incarnations than straight homosexuality
[01:48:30] <emmeka> 3) "bisexual" means a lot of different things, ie, everything from 2-5 on the Kinsey scale
[01:48:33] <brainwash> look at the date
[01:48:36] <brainwash> 1940
[01:48:57] <emmeka> yeah but these findings haven't changed much in the interrim, surprisingly.
[01:49:02] <brainwash> you think that people openly admitted to be gay back then?
[01:49:39] <brainwash> it was a taboo I think
[01:49:54] <emmeka> Kinsey didn't just straight up ask people if they identified as gay, there was a bit more science to his surveys. He basically measured thousands of people's arousal to various things.
[01:50:23] <emmeka> got a bunch of randos to agree to medical experiments and instead showed them porn
[01:51:00] <brainwash> even a straight man would pop a boner when presented a (hot) naked man

[01:51:24] <emmeka> carrying on,
[01:52:05] <emmeka> brainwash all that aside, being bisexual isn't really experienced as "being straight with bonus gay powers"
[01:52:40] <emmeka> bisexuals fit in neither with straight people nor with gays, though they'll boink either of them
[01:53:10] <emmeka> or put otherwise, they're sort of discriminated against by both groups
[01:53:11] <JesseDesu> bagel boinkers
[01:53:44] <brainwash> no way
[01:54:02] <JesseDesu> are mulatos dual citizenship
[01:54:08] <brainwash> I kind of expect women to be bisexual
[01:54:24] <brainwash> cuz everyone loves boobies and pussy
[01:54:31] <brainwash> it's a given
[01:55:32] <emmeka> brainwash statistically, a lot of studies have found female bisexuality is less common than male bisexuality, or about equally as common. Though *identifying* as bisexual is drastically more common for women.
[01:55:39] <emmeka> which isn't surprising, there's less stigma to that.
[01:56:25] <brainwash> lesbo sex appears to be natural
[01:57:14] <brainwash> it could be that my view on that matter has been influenced by porn sites
[01:57:20] <MootPoot> I mean, we have mr tsundere who probably singlehandedly removes the stigma

[03:55:07] <Matt|home> you know, every gay and bi woman i know says the same thing to me
[03:55:12] <Matt|home> women are fucking crazy
[03:55:15] <Matt|home> i tend to agree
[03:55:38] <Matt|home> i very much doubt japanese women are an exception
[03:55:39] <omero> yes. because to maintain frozen CO2 requires it to be stored in a low-temp environment

[03:59:06] <Matt|home> i was just thinking.. i don't believe in an afterlife, but if i could get reincarnated or transported somewhere else to a fictional world, there is one manga i'd love to go to. any ideas where you'd like to be if not the classical heaven/hell idealogy?
[03:59:14] <amigojapan> Matt|home: I meant "what is the question
[03:59:41] <Matt|home> if you could pick a world or setting or place to get transported or reincarnated to where would it be
[03:59:48] <Matt|home> or none, if you don't want to
[04:00:24] <amigojapan> Matt|home: hmm. Well if I am going to live forever, I want a place that has no more suffering

[04:01:06] <ImoutoBot> [title] A Kind World Manga - Mangakakalot.com
[04:01:23] <amigojapan> Let me see
[04:01:44] <Matt|home> it's just a play on "not actually sex, just innocent and kind play" basically
[04:01:48] <Matt|home> but the goddamn title is a kind world
[04:02:22] <Matt|home> a world with free health care, where people are legitimately nice to each other not out of selfishness but kindness, probably no corporate insanity, 
[04:02:26] <Matt|home> yeah that'd be fucking ideal
[04:03:47] <amigojapan> Matt|home: ah nice
[04:04:43] <amigojapan> Matt|home: but you should not need healthcare in an ideal world
[04:05:13] <amigojapan> Matt|home: that means people are still getting sick
[04:05:45] <Matt|home> well it's a kinder world, not heaven
[04:05:56] <amigojapan> Ok
[04:06:22] <Matt|home> i really do hate this world
[04:07:15] <amigojapan> Matt|home: I hope heaven does exist and this world is just a place we go to before so we can really appreciate it
[04:08:34] <amigojapan> Matt|home: but I don't how hell exists
[04:08:45] <amigojapan> Don't hope*
[04:12:38] <amigojapan> omero: I slept really well after my spuntino :)
[04:13:02] <omero> yup... you flatlined amigojapan :)
[04:13:13] <amigojapan> Hahaha
[04:13:41] <amigojapan> omero: tho I did have a bad dream at the end
[04:14:07] <omero> brief moment ... its the state before awakening from the flatline state ;)
[04:14:55] <amigojapan> omero: I dreamt I was in the car with my father. And we were riding twords a fire, and he was hell bent on getting thru. But it was impossible
[04:15:36] <omero> most such dreams cannot even be recorded by consciousness
[04:16:07] <omero> recorded/registered... its noise
[04:16:15] <amigojapan> omero: I have more dreams than an average person
[04:16:32] <omero> like when you tune your radio from one station to another
[04:17:07] <amigojapan> omero: you mean the cosmic background radiation?
[04:17:51] <omero> wow... you would have to possess a really great 'antenna' for sensing that amigojapan :)
[04:18:04] <omero> antenna grande!

[04:49:51] <Nanobot> amigojapan: It incorporates too much reality for me to consider it "improvised anime". They always start out trying to play "an anime character", but it ends up being a merger of fantasy and reality.

[10:06:10] <Nanobot> And there's no system to the characters. It's just randomly generated.
[10:06:51] <Nanobot> However, I have to keep typing the password at least every few days or I risk losing the muscle memory.

[14:06:15] <Cryowolf> ah busy next week, MRI, Tests and doctors visit, then oncologist on monday 11th,
[14:06:56] <Cryowolf> hopefully good news
[14:06:58] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: MRI is so noisy
[14:07:28] <Cryowolf> yeah but they put those noise cancelling headphones and let you listen to music
[14:07:50] <amigojapan> Ah nice, not in Japan
[14:07:51] <Cryowolf> the most annoying part is they are MRIng my arms so I have to lie in very awkward positions and not move for 1-10 minutes a time
[14:08:08] <amigojapan> Ah
[14:08:18] <Cryowolf> gonna take 1.5h

[14:08:39] <Cryowolf> move*
[14:08:58] <Cryowolf> but they count for more time in case it becomes harder to get me into position etc
[14:09:43] <Cryowolf> the annoying part is a medicine of mine gives me the occasional muscle spasm in arms and legs
[14:09:49] <Cryowolf> hopefully that wont happen in that hour

[14:44:45] <spoonm> it sounds so nice now
[14:45:42] <Sadale> What did you mean by 60% mechanical keyboard?
[14:46:03] <amigojapan> My guess is some keys are not mechanical
[14:47:04] <Sadale> I see.
[14:47:09] <Sadale> oh. I get it.
[14:47:20] <Sadale> It's the size. 60% means that it isn't a full-sized keyboard

[14:54:08] <Urchin[emacs]> diacritics are dead keys
[14:54:17] <emmeka> MootPoot I use a US International AltGr layout. It just behaves like any other US keyboard layout, until you hold AltGr, at which point other keys let you type special characters or combining diacritics

[14:56:09] <emmeka> this isn't usually a problem, I know all the major ones, but sometimes I wanna type a yen symbol or something and have to fish for it

[14:57:03] <Urchin[emacs]> the only pain point I have is that 'j' is pretty common in my native language
[14:57:36] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] is it annoying when gaming, though? do games recognize that you're not using QWERTY or do they still by default map all keys around WASD

[15:29:43] <MootPoot> all the toaster ovens double as convection ovens 
[15:29:44] <amigojapan> MootPoot: my toaster oven has no digital parts
[15:29:51] <MootPoot> most of them at least
[15:29:58] <amigojapan> I see
[15:30:52] <MootPoot> well maybe its just a market thing
[15:31:00] <MootPoot> afaik teh japanese dont really bake many foods
[15:31:41] <death916> a toaster oven is jus a sealed toaster basically no reason you couldnt bake something in even the most basic one
[15:31:42] <amigojapan> Some people do. But in ovens not in toaster ovens
[15:31:46] <death916> as long as it holds temp
[15:32:09] <MootPoot> a toaster oven is typically a normal tabletop oven here
[15:32:14] <death916> i used to have one i should get one again
[15:32:20] <amigojapan> death916: I would be afraid it works over heat
[15:32:25] <MootPoot> they're pretty nice to have
[15:32:31] <death916> ya
[15:32:34] <MootPoot> I'm making potato patties in mine right now
[15:32:35] <death916> jus got a new crockpot
[15:32:38] <death916> which is alsao lovely
[15:32:39] <MootPoot> nahhh
[15:32:42] <MootPoot> crockpot is dead
[15:32:46] <MootPoot> instapot time
[15:32:53] <death916> lol na
[15:32:56] <death916> too fancy
[15:32:57] <MootPoot> crockpot is okay for a backup 
[15:33:08] <death916> i jus need something to throw a bunch of shit in and leave alone for a few hours
[15:33:17] <MootPoot> you can do that with a instapot
[15:33:27] <MootPoot> but pressure cook as wel
[15:33:44] <death916> thats what my pressure cookers for
[15:33:47] <death916> lol
[15:34:35] <amigojapan> death916: my instapot has a start time timer to start cooking later
[15:34:52] <death916> thats pretty nice 
[15:35:03] <amigojapan> Yup
[15:35:24] <MootPoot> death916: a insta pot can do all the things that a pressure cooker, open pot, crock pot, slow cooker can do
[15:35:36] <MootPoot> I got one and just stopped using like 90% of the rest of my kitchenware
[15:35:54] <MootPoot> only problem is that they are a bit slow at it, you might have to wait longer then an actual stove
[15:36:05] <death916> ya but i got mine for free so im nt gna buy nothin else till it dies
[15:36:12] <MootPoot> ah
[15:36:15] <death916> kitchen stuff is so expensive
[15:36:15] <MootPoot> that makes sense
[15:36:26] <MootPoot> good kitchen stuff lasts forever 
[15:36:34] <death916> ya usually true
[15:37:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: at least it would seem that with the crock pot you don't need to worry about replacing the seals
[15:37:40] <MootPoot> hmm
[15:38:08] <death916> i made some chili when i had covid
[15:38:11] <death916> ate that shit for lieka week
[15:38:16] <death916> cuz i didnt have energy for nothin else
[15:38:35] <amigojapan> Ouch death916 
[15:38:37] <MootPoot> amigojapan: true, but afaik you can buy new seals
[15:38:45] <MootPoot> I've never had to replace a seal on a insta pot
[15:39:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but it is better if you don't need to
[15:39:13] <death916> i wish instapot was weed that instantly grew
[15:39:14] <MootPoot> well you dont NEED to with the instant pot
[15:39:25] <MootPoot> you only need to if you want to use the pressure setting
[15:39:36] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[15:39:47] <MootPoot> the instant pots that I've had before usually have valve failure on the top part
[15:39:55] <MootPoot> not seal failure
[15:40:06] <MootPoot> but then I started buying a copycat instant pot
[15:40:13] <MootPoot> and that lasts longer then the original instnat pot

[17:55:17] <MootPoot> how long will it take
[17:55:48] <Sadale> Try HDD dock. This way you wouldn't need an NAS
[17:55:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 8bits in a byte
[17:56:12] <Sadale> And 1Gbit LAN connection is often quite a bit less than a Gbit depending on the router you've got.
[17:56:25] <MootPoot> Sadale: nobody makes a 8-10 hdd dock
[17:56:26] <MootPoot> lol
[17:56:31] <Sadale> ouch
[17:57:04] <MootPoot> I do have a usb transfer cable that can do 5gbit in theory
[17:57:10] <MootPoot> but also it is not 100% a serial transfer
[17:57:19] <MootPoot> so I doubt even if I used it, it would go any faster
[17:57:27] <MootPoot> right now its going at 45MBps
[17:57:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot: serial is slower than parallel
[17:58:02] <MootPoot> its a hdd
[17:58:05] <MootPoot> it cant write in paralell
[17:58:24] <amigojapan> It has multiple heads tho
[17:58:24] <MootPoot> actually it CAN..but I dont have one of those dual actuator drives
[17:58:35] <amigojapan> Ok
[17:58:42] <MootPoot> multiple heads is just to read or write a single stream faster afaik
[17:58:46] <MootPoot> it cant like do 2 things at once
[17:59:16] <Sadale> If the clock rate is high enough serial would be as good as parallel, or even better.
[17:59:29] <Sadale> With USB 3 you get 5Gbps.
[17:59:58] <amigojapan> Sadale: well parallel could be 8 times faster
[18:00:18] <MootPoot> wait, wtf
[18:00:24] <MootPoot> theres no bottleneck
[18:00:28] <MootPoot> why is this transfer so slow
[18:00:53] <Sadale> true
[18:00:57] <MootPoot> ????????????????????
[18:01:03] <MootPoot> wtf
[18:01:05] <Sadale> MootPoot, what's slow?
[18:01:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, Did you mean your harddrive is at 45MB/s? That's normal for spinning hard drive.
[18:01:52] <MootPoot> connection is 1gbit to the NAS, both my hdds are not at even close to 100% utilization, and the 1gbit is not being fully utilized , only 300-350mbits/s with spikes to 500
[18:01:56] <MootPoot> I have no idea
[18:02:04] <MootPoot> nothing is at 100%
[18:02:08] <MootPoot> what's  the  hold up
[18:02:11] <Sadale> That's not surprising. HDDs are slow.
[18:02:16] <MootPoot> no but
[18:02:17] <MootPoot> like
[18:02:22] <MootPoot> the HDDs arent maxed  out
[18:02:27] <MootPoot> not even close to it
[18:02:28] <Sadale> If you're transfering multiple files it takes time to perform random access.
[18:02:50] <MootPoot> yeah, but the drive should have 100% active time in that case
[18:02:51] <MootPoot> right
[18:02:57] <TheRoeyening> <Sadale> MootPoot, Did you mean your harddrive is at 45MB/s? That's normal for spinning hard drive. <- my gosh, how far we've come..
[18:02:57] <MootPoot> even if the speed is slow
[18:03:16] <TheRoeyening> Sadale: now that we have 3000-6000 MB/s read/write NVME devices

[18:03:30] <MootPoot> ?????????????
[18:03:44] <MootPoot> if it was clogged up with random access that should be at 100% 
[18:03:52] <TheRoeyening> then again... how often do we need to put a premium on shuffling gigabytes of data from storge to memory?  
[18:04:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, weird indeed.
[18:04:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, are you using a raid array or something?
[18:04:46] <MootPoot> no, its a simple 1:1 backup
[18:04:49] <MootPoot> from identical drives
[18:04:56] <MootPoot> they are both seagate EXOS X18 drives

[18:05:21] <MootPoot> teracopy
[18:05:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, anyway I think 63.5MB/s is normal for HDD.
[18:05:33] <Sadale> It's a bit on the slower side but it's still normal to me.
[18:05:37] <MootPoot> in serial writes these hdds exceed 250

[18:06:37] <Sadale> How fast you're reading tho?
[18:06:45] <MootPoot> its the same on the read drive

[18:07:16] * Sadale googles ST18000NM000J
[18:07:24] <MootPoot> however the transfer did start in the first few seconds at gigabit
[18:08:19] <Sadale> That's because of cache
[18:08:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, hold on. What's your setup again? Did you do the cloning of drive via the LAN network?
[18:09:15] <TheRoeyening> amigojapan: ah

[18:09:22] <TheRoeyening> amigojapan: sure
[18:09:31] <TheRoeyening> WELLAKSHUALLY it's a tisane
[18:09:35] <TheRoeyening> they're right.
[18:09:42] <Sadale> If it's over the network 65MB/s isn't bad at all. That's 500Mbits.
[18:09:54] <Sadale> Some routers are doing worse than 500Mbits.
[18:09:59] <Sadale> 500Mbps*
[18:10:13] <amigojapan> TheRoeyening: will I like herbal and want to talk about it too
[18:11:45] <MootPoot> Sadale: so it's because I have a consumer grade router?
[18:11:52] * MootPoot grumbles
[18:12:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: stop buying shit
[18:12:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, Probably. Try doing benchmark on the maximum transfer rate of your router. Very often a router that supports 1Gbps ethernet doesn't mean that it supports full 1Gbps.
[18:12:54] <MootPoot> amigojapan: what
[18:12:56] <Sadale> amigojapan, aww be nice to poor MootPoot. He purchased the HDD with his hard-earned money :(
[18:13:04] <TheRoeyening> amigojapan: aye.  They /will/ talk about it.  That's just one or two people who are purist like that
[18:13:09] <Sadale> And I'm sure that he could find some use of the 18TB HDD.
[18:13:29] <TheRoeyening> amigojapan: also, beaky is the god-king of the channel.
[18:13:33] <MootPoot> Well I'm going to use a usb transfer cable anyway so I'm going to leave this router alone
[18:13:38] <amigojapan> Sadale: now he is thinking of buying a business grade router
[18:13:43] <MootPoot> Sadale: I have 2 of this 18tbs

[18:13:49] <Sadale> lol*
[18:13:50] <TheRoeyening> amigojapan: his compendium of knowledge of teas outweighs most of what I've seen from everone else there
[18:14:05] <Sadale> amigojapan, I'd suggest him to use SATA for both of the HDDs. Or even use USB.
[18:14:09] <TheRoeyening> beaky: <3
[18:14:26] <Sadale> USB3 has 5Gbits and it can often perform better than 1Gbps.

[18:31:47] <TheRoeyening> ^ also true
[18:31:50] <amigojapan> TheRoeyening: here in Japan they call many things cha that don't contain tea leaf at all. Every mushroom tea
[18:31:59] <TheRoeyening> interesting, ok
[18:32:11] <TheRoeyening> in Japan I bet they hve all this Chinese medicine tisanes
[18:32:30] <TheRoeyening> like.. they find an herb that some say has some medicinal effect, and make it into a tisane
[18:32:43] <TheRoeyening> and then sell this to dumb Americans
[18:33:01] <amigojapan> darkwitch: mint tea is lovely in winter
[18:33:03] <TheRoeyening> (speaking as one of these consumers)
[18:33:35] <TheRoeyening> I wonder how cannabis tea tastes (non-activated)
[18:33:56] <darkwitch> some put licorice root in all their problems others put hibiscus
[18:34:16] <TheRoeyening> ok
[18:34:23] <TheRoeyening> problems?
[18:34:38] <darkwitch> I have fragrance with cannabis
[18:34:52] <amigojapan> TheRoeyening: Mexico drinks hibiscus. But does not call it "tea"they call it "Jamaican water
[18:35:13] <TheRoeyening> oh how interesting!
[18:35:42] <TheRoeyening> darkwitch: like, I'm sure there is a lot to be done with the essential smells of cannabis, such that one could use it as a tea
[18:35:52] <TheRoeyening> i"m hnot talking about anything psychoactive here
[18:35:58] <TheRoeyening> hemp, then.
[18:35:58] <darkwitch> alkemia hippie spirit also has cannabis as a note
[18:36:00] <TheRoeyening> drinki9ng hemp tea.
[18:36:07] <TheRoeyening> darkwitch: ahg
[18:36:09] <TheRoeyening> *ah
[18:36:25] <darkwitch> yes, it's only for the smell, not the other uses

[19:11:14] <darkwitch> not everyone experiences smells the same way
[19:11:34] <TheRoeyening> I mean I won't lie, part of the reason I like patchouli so much is because of the hippie chic

[19:12:56] <pteague_laptop> isn't cilantro 1 of those things that has a dna marker for not liking it?
[19:13:19] <darkwitch> I believe so pteague_laptop
[19:13:35] <darkwitch> maybe the same applies to patchouli
[19:13:39] <amigojapan> pteague_laptop: there are some Japanese people that like it, and some that hate it

[19:14:06] <amigojapan> Let me see MootPoot 
[19:15:24] <pteague_laptop> i know there's at least 2 food items where looking at your dna they can say you probably don't like that ... 1 of them makes the thing taste soapy
[19:16:44] <TheRoeyening> <pteague_laptop> isn't cilantro 1 of those things that has a dna marker for not liking i <- 
[19:16:45] <pteague_laptop> the other makes you dislike certain greens i think as possibly poisonous (even though they're not)
[19:16:53] <TheRoeyening> well, actually, cilantro is evil.
[19:17:13] <TheRoeyening> some of us are lucky enough to be born with a gene that grants us the power to detect it from far away
[19:17:31] <darkwitch> I prefer calling it coriander
[19:18:01] <TheRoeyening> this is the so-called "protective" gene, for it enables us to alert those around us, who may not have this hidden ability, to the dangers of this noxious weed.
[19:18:05] <pteague_laptop> i also don't prefer vanilla ice cream & i also have the marker for salty snacks over sweet >.>
[19:18:10] <TheRoeyening> coriander is its idiot seed form
[19:19:54] <darkwitch> it's called coriandrum sativum, and that includes everything, not only the seeds
[19:20:17] <KatrinValerie> You can use the leafy parts for spicey spices too
[19:20:29] <pteague_laptop> why was i required for this meeting?

[19:20:53] <darkwitch> calling it cilantro is for those who enjoy the spanish language
[19:21:18] <KatrinValerie> pteague_laptop:most of this dna analysis stuff is basically astrology
[19:22:05] <darkwitch> Most people perceive the taste of coriander leaves as a tart, lemon/lime taste, but to nearly a quarter of those surveyed, the leaves taste like dish soap, linked to a gene which detects some specific aldehydes that are also used as odorant substances in many soaps and detergents.
[19:24:26] <darkwitch> those damn aldehydes, murdering many fragrances, starting with chanel no. 5
[19:36:47] <Bco1981> Mambo no. 5 is better
[19:37:24] <Bco1981> Johnny No. 5 is the best.
[19:37:29] <darkwitch> what's the smell of mambo?
[19:38:34] <Bco1981> a lot of different things all at the same time, like Sandra and Rita, and ya'know it's gettin' sweater.
[19:38:45] <Bco1981> sweeter*
[19:38:48] <darkwitch> like cigar smoke and guava fruit
