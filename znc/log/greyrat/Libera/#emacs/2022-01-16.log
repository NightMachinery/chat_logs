[06:51:21] <AndrewYu> Guix is the optimal package manager
[06:51:42] <AndrewYu> (Except that there've been slow servers in a while, but no worries)
[06:51:44] <sam_> pingpongball: honestly I think there's downsides to a distro which is preconfigured like that
[06:51:55] <sam_> i.e. it's probably quite niche, and therefore needs a lot of work in other areas
[06:51:56] <aidalgol> *cough*Nix*cough*
[06:52:04] <sam_> it's a lot easier to just configure a distro which is flexible

[06:55:48] <AndrewYu> Yeah, with Guix I do the minimal install, and put my emacs in there myself
[06:55:55] <pingpongball> is it hard to configure emacs from scratch?
[06:55:56] <karthik> Long shot, but does anyone have an uninstall script for the Guix package manager? I mean a script to uninstall the package manager when it's installed in a "foreign" distro (Guix terminology)
[06:56:01] <sam_> no, not at all
[06:56:21] <pingpongball> like i want to have same functionalities like doom emacs, but i dont wanted to use doom emacs, because i want to look cool internet kid.
[06:56:26] *** Quits: wildwestrom (~wildwestr@64.44.42.163) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:56:33] <sam_> in the nicest possible way, that sounds like a you problem? :)
[06:56:41] <sam_> like, if you want Doom Emacs, use Doom, or look at its config and try to understand it
[06:56:50] <sam_> obviously doom is a complete package
[06:57:17] <karthik> Basically an easy way to remove the /gnu directory, remove the guix-daemon, the guix user and whatever else guix installs.

I'm having a problem, where I press capital R to rename, then I rename it, or cancel with `C-g`, but then I can't focus on the frame I was just in. I either have to create a new frame and close the old one, or restart emacs.

[12:18:26] <arch-angel> not just the indentation settings, like the spaces between brackets and stuff like that

[15:34:56] <rnkn> hehehe
[15:34:57] <rnkn> everyday
[15:35:03] <wasamasa> just purely hypothetically speaking
[15:35:18] <wasamasa> I do in no way entertain the idea it could be you, I don't know you at all
[15:35:20] <wasamasa> but what if

[15:35:49] *** Joins: badcodec (~sphinx@user/businessclass)
[15:35:54] <rnkn> nah there was a thing about NFTs
[15:36:24] <wasamasa> I thought for a moment I was missing out on some primo lurking spot that has been a thing for ages, but nope
[15:36:44] <rnkn> I suggested a few days back that it seemed like the hate for NFTs was not really about environment
[15:37:07] <rnkn> now, here's where I think I fucked up
[15:38:43] <rnkn> I expected people to read that and think "maybe my motivation are not exactly as I advertise them to be?" self-awareness, etc.
[15:40:32] <rnkn> if I were smarter I would have realised that the absolute worst thing you can do to someone is suggest they're not as moral as they purport
[15:40:48] <rnkn> even if indirectly
[15:41:13] <glyph> rnkn: I apologize for a hit-and-run comment here but I just noticed this as I was going to bed. However, I think that emotions tend to run hot around NFTs because they're such a straightforward financial crime, and the environmental consequences are obviously also bad. So if you say "maybe you hate it because X", people get upset because if a nontechnical bystander hears you say that, they might think there's a valid debate around them
[15:41:20] <glyph> and therefore gamble their money and get scammed
[15:42:08] *** Joins: lordrishav_ (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav)
[15:44:04] <glyph> I can fully admit that the impulse to scream about NFTs all the time is a coping mechanism for certain problems with the way the world works and a general lack of agency, I agree there's some reflecting to do on how much emphasis to put on them vs. other problems, but it's genuinely upsetting for a lot of people with backgrounds in finance that so much of the public is getting tricked by this stuff, and that there's nothing we can seem to do about it

[15:48:56] <glyph> rnkn: crypto solves an actual problem, albeit a niche problem that most people do not need solved (I've been screaming about crypto since at least 2016, so, yeah, I agree :)) in addition to creating tons of worse problems
[15:49:03] <rnkn> a decade of crypto scams barely register a blip but the minute that artists start getting some cash it's like the world has come crashing down

[15:49:38] <rnkn> crypto solves nothing
[15:49:47] <rnkn> it only introduced problems

[15:50:54] <theothornhill> right. so a poorly performing linked list, with ponzi schemes as data
[15:50:57] <glyph> theothornhill: it's the kind of problem you need to solve if you're trying to create an interbank transfer system in the absence of regulatory authorities, like if you're going to build one for mutually hostile nation states to engage in triangular trade
[15:51:29] <glyph> theothornhill: yeah 99% of it is ponzi schemes, no argument there. but with link-to-a-JPEG NFTs, it's 100% ;)
[15:51:42] <theothornhill> I've heard all of these things. It's the same argument as: we need to overengineer this shit now because "scaling"
[15:51:55] <rnkn> but let's just put it in an entirely different context... corrupt politicians will predictably swindle millions of dollars into private hands each term and the rection will almost always be "oh well politicians are corrupt" but you try getting 2% of that value to support the arts and watch how people get up in arms
[15:52:18] <wgreenhouse> this is a long and unproductive offtopic tangent--do we need to stand up the #ideologies channel from freenode?
[15:52:20] <glyph> rnkn: the idea that NFTs support artists is largely false
[15:52:41] <glyph> beeple made a lot of money that one time but the money in NFTs is not going to artists, it's a rounding error

[16:04:29] <wgreenhouse> rnkn: fwiw, what got my hackles up was the ~20min heated offtopic argument between two users. that tends to mean things are headed noplace good. my personal view, which I'm trying to keep out of this channel moderation decision, is that _both_ NFTs and cryptocoins are expensive harmful garbage.

[22:21:28] <tusko> Friends, I have a problem with my emacs config. it is complaining about `Error (use-package): material-theme/:config: Lisp nesting exceeds ‘max-lisp-eval-depth’`

[22:24:37] *** Quits: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:24:42] <_dave> you're missing out then.
[22:24:49] <edrx> =(
[22:24:59] <tusko> That's right. It works fine on my other device, but when I import to this one it complains about that error
[22:25:11] <tusko> Its so bizarre, I only copy-pasted the whole config.
[22:25:17] <_dave> well, somewhat. if what you got works because you're an æmacs grognard, then that's fine. use-package will be a bit superfluous to refactor everything for.
[22:25:56] *** Quits: atw (~user@ool-18bf5678.dyn.optonline.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:26:13] <wgreenhouse> _dave: the org-mode built into emacs was frozen as of the time of that emacs release. what org-mode publishes on their elpa repo is close to the bleeding edge of development
[22:26:21] <wgreenhouse> which for org is still fairly rapid
[22:26:25] <_dave> didn't think org updated that quickly.
[22:26:39] <edrx> did you try to create a file ~/.emacs.mini with just the call to use-package that triggets the error and then run emacs as "emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.mini"?
[22:26:43] *** Joins: atw (~user@ool-18bf5678.dyn.optonline.net)
[22:27:04] <wgreenhouse> _dave: yeah, pretty quickly by emacs standards, and with fairly frequent incompatible changes you're expected to keep up with

[22:27:46] <wgreenhouse> _dave: the intermediate position would be to follow the `maint` branch of their git repo
[22:28:12] <_dave> if that's intermediate, what would be higher/most immediate? following the `main` branch?
[22:28:24] <_dave> 'scuse me, `master` branch? it's been so long since i've touched master branches.
[22:28:50] <tusko> edrx, I didn't but I can do that
[22:28:52] <wgreenhouse> yeah. their package.el output is basically that delayed by a few days
[22:29:07] <_dave> not like i update my packages that often. maybe once a month.

[22:29:42] <technomancy> I haven't updated a package since 2019
[22:30:05] <technomancy> what kind of packages are you using that you get useful things added on a monthly basis; that's wild
[22:30:06] <_dave> that's because you're still using your ancient machines.
[22:30:32] <wgreenhouse> technomancy: org is still deciding what it is
[22:30:37] <edrx> my machine is a thinkpad from 2014
[22:30:38] <_dave> i just got my framework laptop. goodbye lappy486 thinkpad, hello something modern.
[22:30:39] <wgreenhouse> so there's a lot
[22:31:42] <tusko> This is the relevant snippet of the config https://bpa.st/F7ZQ

[22:33:09] <_dave> no, it's simple.
