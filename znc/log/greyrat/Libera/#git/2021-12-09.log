[00:04:00] <tcurdt_> I cannot switch branches because some files seem to always be modified ... I cannot even stage the changes ... I assume this has something to do with a case change on the file
[00:04:09] <tcurdt_> not sure how to get rid of that
[00:04:15] <tcurdt_> prevents me to switch branches
[00:05:17] <tcurdt_> any wise words on how to deal with that?

[00:05:21] <gitinfo> To fix problems with line ending on different platforms, check out http://line-endings.gitrecipes.de/. Line ending normalization can be the cause of changed files that appear to not go away.
[00:05:54] <ikke> tcurdt_: what does git ls-files --eol <filename> return for one of the files that are always modified?
[00:06:04] <tcurdt_> na, those are images

[01:56:19] <sudomann> Is that what is called a detached head
[01:56:31] <ZacSharp> no
[01:56:47] <ZacSharp> detatched head means you have a commit checked out without being on a branch
[01:57:01] <sudomann> SO how can one be in a git repo at any point with no workspace checked out
[01:57:01] <ZacSharp> bare repository means you have nothing checked out
[01:57:13] <sudomann> assuming workspace means branch
[01:57:26] <ZacSharp> the workspace is where the files are
[01:57:35] <ZacSharp> the thing you are editing
[01:57:50] <imMute> bare repos are ones created with 'git init --bare'.  it's typically used on git repo hosting
[01:57:53] <DoofusCanadensis> a normal project has a workspace with files and a .git folder containing the repository contents
[01:57:56] <ZacSharp> and a bare repo doesn't have that, it's a pure database
[01:58:05] <imMute> a bare repo is just that .git dir, really
[01:58:07] <DoofusCanadensis> ^ just the .git folder

[06:05:48] <darkblueb> hi - in bash, if I cd to a repo, and do  git fetch --all ;   then use pull to get the main branch... I dont get all the branches from the upstream git, only ones I have asked for before .. is this about right?
[06:07:22] <darkblueb> in a very common and simple way, if someone made a new working branch on the remote git repo, then doing only  git fetch --all; git pull origin master   ;   does not get info about the new branch .. is that true?

[06:11:28] <rewt> first, "--all" only means it fetches from all remotes, so you might as well leave it off if you only have a single one (usually named origin)
[06:11:36] <darkblueb> oohh sorry
[06:11:41] <darkblueb> ok
[06:11:43] <rewt> and it will fetch all commits that you don't locally have already
[06:12:13] <darkblueb> all commits meaning the contents of them.. for all known branches.. ?
[06:12:39] <darkblueb> not just the header for the commits for all nodes of all branches

[06:14:13] <darkblueb> well to make this concrete.. there is a github repo called  openstreetmap/osm2pgsql  .. I did a  git fetch ;  git pull origin master;  git push     to another git on the network
[06:14:35] <darkblueb> there is a new branch that I had not seen or copied, since the last time I visited that repo
[06:15:11] <darkblueb> when I did  fetch ; pull/merge;  push   .. it looks like I do not know about this new branch, on the third repo

[06:15:31] <rewt> `git push` pushes the current branch
[06:15:57] <darkblueb> well the actual command was   git push --all
[06:16:29] <darkblueb> and, I misunderstood about the fetch, so I probably will see that about the push
[06:16:38] <rewt> that would push all local branches
[06:17:13] *** Joins: sudomann (~sudomann@98.219.211.182)
[06:17:33] <rewt> if you don't have a local branch to match that new branch, it won't show up on the other remote you're pushing to
[06:17:35] <darkblueb> right - so I want to improve the tiny bit of git I use, and get ALL the branches from my upstream github example, and then push ALL the branches to my own net repo
[06:17:49] <darkblueb> thats what I am learning about now, yes
[06:18:04] <darkblueb> refresh the typing habit
[06:19:19] <rewt> maybe git push --mirror will do what you're after
[06:19:36] <darkblueb> maybe, but git fetch did not get me the new branch?
[06:19:53] <rewt> it should've
[06:20:00] <darkblueb> ok good to confirm
[06:20:02] <rewt> it says on the output if there are any new branches
[06:20:36] <darkblueb> yes I thought that was the case, but this quick three-step, did not result in the new branch being on my own repo .. checking again
[06:20:53] <rewt> which branch are you on when you're doing this?
[06:21:26] <darkblueb> my trusty linux box spins away for weeks at a time, and I manually revisit the directory of source code for this tool, from time to time
[06:21:53] <darkblueb> the last time I was in that local repo, 9 times out of ten, I left it at master  or main ...the primary branch
[06:22:19] <rewt> if you're on master, you can just do "git pull" instead of "git fetch ;  git pull origin master;"

[06:23:13] <rewt> git pull should include that, since it is just git fetch followed by git merge
[06:23:19] <darkblueb> as you say, the new activity is there.. its a handy summary for these long standing code projects
[06:23:38] <darkblueb> only for one branch?
[06:23:44] <rewt> hm?
[06:24:16] <darkblueb> sorry, what I would like to learn is the reliable three steps .. gets all the new branches and whatnot, then push them to my other net repo

[07:38:41] <rewt> did you add your public key to your github account?
[07:39:10] <darkblueb> just so its clear, I do this now with an alias and an invocation for a year.. and yes the alias uses the ssh form
[07:39:38] <darkblueb> a few times a week, most weeks, for the last year.. and nothing has changed about that

[07:40:01] <darkblueb> its not scriptable by me the way it is.. but it works
[07:40:12] <rewt> you have an alias to add the remote url?  you should only need to add it once
[07:40:56] <darkblueb> I am definitely not following how I could use the ssh form and not also supply any credential on my side
[07:41:28] <rewt> if you use the ssh url, the ssh key is your login; no need for username/password
[07:41:51] <rewt> the https doesn't use the ssh key, so it needs the username/password

[08:04:10] <darkblueb> which works ok now

[13:51:33] <petitefur> Howdy, hi, shalom, and skrrrrr,
[13:51:47] <petitefur> I'm relatively new to git and am seeking advice on best practice: How to start a git repo for a local-only, single-contributor, existing codebase?
[13:51:49] *** Quits: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.73.223) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:51:57] <petitefur> Local only meaning that I don't have permission to upload the code, let alone make it public. Single contributor since for now, it's just me trying to move away from a tar-archive based development. And existing codebase: several hundred thousand LOC, accumulated over, well, very long.
[13:52:10] <petitefur> Is someone here  willing to guide me? I do bring my own plan to the table.
[13:53:59] <teddyc> petitefur: git init && git add . && git commit -m "inital commit"?
[13:54:08] <rudi_s> petitefur: Should be pretty simple. Create a new repository, import the existing tars as separate commits and start working.
[13:54:59] <rudi_s> You can "fake" the commit date/author by using the GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE environment variables with `git commit`.
[13:55:25] *** Joins: synthmeat (~synthmeat@user/synthmeat)
[13:55:41] <rudi_s> So the initial import is just a for loop which removes all files from the current directory, unpacks the next tarball, runs `git add . && GIT_AUTHOR_DATE=... git commit` and so on.
[13:55:53] <osse> how many tar files? there are tools to handle that. but if it's less than tenish I'd do it by hand
[13:56:18] <rudi_s> (Oh, and in general, have some patience in IRC. Answers can take a few minutes to hours, depending on the channel.)
[13:56:51] <rudi_s> Right, even in contrib there's fast-import/import-tars.perl
[13:57:52] <rudi_s> Hm, uses the mtime of the file as commit date. That won't work for all archives.
[13:58:15] <petitefur> Awesome, thanks for the fast responses!
[13:58:15] <petitefur> I do bring the time to ask questions on IRC and will read the responses coming in over the next hours.

[13:59:56] <petitefur> The initial setup is mostly clear and I'm starting off one tar archive that will set my initial commit. Authorship is currently tracked in the sources as comments, so all commits I will track as mine - but very interesting feature!
[14:00:15] <petitefur> Allow me to drop my current plan:
[14:00:38] <petitefur> Situation:
[14:00:39] <petitefur> Three stages of development, strictly building upon each other in the order:
[14:00:39] <petitefur> "original source" -> "my fixes" -> "my additions"
[14:00:40] <petitefur> which currently reside in three separate folders with the one I want to use the binaries from linked to.
[14:00:40] <petitefur> Steps:
[14:00:41] <petitefur> git init in the directory of "original source".
[14:00:41] <petitefur> [?] create a tag to identify this version 1.0.0 or smth like that
[14:00:42] <petitefur> [?] commit the changes made in "my fixes"
[14:00:42] <petitefur> [?] create a tag to identify this as a new package for production, say version 1.0.1
[14:00:43] <petitefur> [?] several commits with changes from "my additions"
[14:00:43] <petitefur> [?] create a tag to identify this version 1.1.0
[14:00:44] <petitefur> Notes:
[14:00:44] <petitefur> The steps starting with [?] are up for discussion.
[14:00:45] <petitefur> I have never created tags before. Is that a reasonable way to create/indicate releases?

[14:03:29] <dka> osse, yes

[14:04:31] <rudi_s> petitefur: To keep the history intact (as well as that can be done with tars) I'd commit each tar as separate commit.

[17:07:34] <rawtaz> yeah something like that. and stash management. i feel it looks like it's just adding another layer of commands oyu have to learn

[17:07:42] * dminuoso shrugs
[17:07:51] <dminuoso> All the ergonomic bugs in git were addressed by magit for me.
[17:08:36] <rawtaz> how does that work for you when you are on a server where you havent got emacs and magit?
[17:09:28] <dminuoso> tramp has you covered
[17:09:49] <dminuoso> I mean this scenario doesnt really happen here.
[17:10:00] <dminuoso> But the few occasions it did, magit+tramp works like a charm.
[17:10:05] <rawtaz> hm we all have different use cases :)
[17:10:16] <rawtaz> i often work on servers where theres no direct access like that
[17:10:23] <dminuoso> Do you know what tramp is?
[17:10:32] <rawtaz> i presume you meant https://github.com/jwiegley/tramp :o
[17:10:47] <dminuoso> The contributions johnw has done are incredible.
[17:10:52] <dminuoso> All over the place.
[17:10:53] <rawtaz> so remote file editing from your own emacs?
[17:10:58] <rawtaz> oh ok
[17:10:59] <dminuoso> Yeah.
[17:11:05] <rawtaz> yeah that one
[17:11:12] <dminuoso> And it's very transparent as well, and it works well with magit too
[17:11:25] <rawtaz> yeah as long as you can access the server with it :)
[17:11:26] <dminuoso> So you still use your local customized emacs, except the editing or magit happens remote
[17:11:30] <dminuoso> Yeah.
[17:11:42] <dminuoso> Granted, you can always conceive scenarios where tool XYZ wont work
[17:11:54] <rawtaz> indeed

[17:34:42] <dminuoso> rawtaz: Point of interest, I used to be an vi used as well. It was actually magit that won me over, evil-mode made the switch almost unnoticeable.
[17:35:09] <dminuoso> Even today I still use evil-mode, so my emacs mostly feels like vim for the majority of the workload. :)
[17:35:25] <rawtaz> yeah, i would do that too if i ever used emacs :) i just havent gotten to trying it
[17:35:28] <dminuoso> magit is *that* good :)
[17:35:59] <dminuoso> Though I hear good things from lazygit as well
[17:36:09] <rawtaz> i use git on the cli - im concerned that if i use some UI for it 99% of the time i will lose my "proficiency" with the git cli
[17:36:58] <dminuoso> rawtaz: The cute thing about magit is that the git interface is still exposed, but you get a lot of interactivity in the places where you might want it.
[17:37:23] <rawtaz> surely it helps you being productive :)
[17:37:30] <dminuoso> Im just saying it doesnt abstract git away
[17:38:20] <dminuoso> Stuff like interactively staging und unstaging not by hunk (which git might not be able to split further), but by simply selecting a region is really comforting. :)
[17:38:52] <dminuoso> lazygit comes relatively close
[17:39:13] <dminuoso> So you could also give that a try and stick with your editor
