[00:24:11] <funnybunny> How do you do an action in only one tab when a notification is clicked with service workers? I had to add a listener for fetch to get the client ID and then send this as a message to each client/tab. Then the client sends it back with the notification, and the service worker uses it to get the client and respond to the notification. I think it's weird that only fetch has event.clientId. Why isn't
[00:24:17] <funnybunny> it provided for the install event? Is there a better way?

[01:02:47] <joakimk> I'm trying to make a simple (!) website (just a HTML file actually) which should run on Safari on an OLD ipad (ipad 2) and just fetch some JSON from an URL, and render a simple table

[01:04:09] <ljharb> joakimk: fetching json from “not the web server” is a modern capability
[01:04:18] <joakimk> However, I just can not get anything to work on the ipad... iOS 9.3.5. With jQuery: nothing happens. I even tried plain XMLHttpRequest -- still nothing happens.
[01:04:23] <ljharb> joakimk: so you’re almost certainly SOL unless that safari version understands CORS.
[01:04:30] <joakimk> a ha
[01:04:40] <ljharb> joakimk: if you make a proper webserver then you can do it for IE 6 if you want
[01:05:08] <ljharb> otherwise the URL would have to support JSONP, which most don’t anymore
[01:05:17] <joakimk> here's the thing: I have this old ipad, which I don't want to just throw out... I though, why not have it show a weather overview

[01:05:49] <ljharb> !caniuse cors
[01:05:54] <ljharb> guess that’s broken
[01:05:56] <joakimk> ok, but is CORS that "new"?
[01:06:02] <funnybunny> Why don't you just refresh a web page that has a weather overview?
[01:06:04] <joakimk> I mean, OK - this IS an old ipad
[01:06:29] <funnybunny> Or install a weather app
[01:06:34] <ljharb> joakimk: nah it should be fine https://caniuse.com/cors
[01:06:40] <joakimk> the weather report (www.yr.no) should auto-refresh. The website tells me to update my browser. This did work until like 6 months ago
[01:06:46] <ljharb> joakimk: but also the server the url is on has to support cors.

[01:07:14] <ljharb> joakimk: iPhones ships with the weather app, but iPads don’t sadly
[01:07:27] <joakimk> so they provide a weather api, which is great, but I can't access it?
[01:07:30] <joakimk> on this old ipad
[01:07:34] <funnybunny>  What about Google?
[01:07:37] <ljharb> joakimk: then the provider is actively denying you the ability to embed their content, so you won’t likely be able to do it even in a modern machine
[01:07:46] <joakimk> no it's an open api
[01:07:52] <ljharb> joakimk: you can access it on a server. Just not from the iPad itself.
[01:08:16] <joakimk> but... why :D
[01:09:14] <ljharb> because you need a webserver to do anything useful, for decades now
[01:09:22] <ljharb> lots of new stuff just doesn’t work on file:
[01:10:01] <funnybunny> Does anyone know about my question?
[01:10:09] <joakimk> OK.. Guess I got thrown by how this works just fine (in both JQuery and Vanilla JS) if I run the HTML file on a PC
[01:10:24] <joakimk> then I load the JSON and render it just fine

[01:13:20] <ljharb> funnybunny: it's all the same domain, you can coordinate via cookie/localStorage
[01:14:29] <funnybunny> ljharb: What would I need local storage for? If I generate my own unique id, I can send it with the notification, and the service worker can send it back with the response to the notification

[01:17:30] <joakimk> interesting! It does not run on Safari on a Mac

[01:18:19] <ljharb> funnybunny: to make sure that tab 1 and tab 2 don't take the same unique ID value
[01:18:38] <funnybunny> ljharb: Oh, I see
[01:19:02] <funnybunny> That's a cool idea
[01:19:07] <joakimk> Uh, Safari (on mac) complains that `icons.find(u => u.key === val.data.next_1_hours?.summary.symbol_code)?.icon` has a unexpected token
[01:19:19] <joakimk> apparently, I can't use the ? after the find?
[01:19:34] <ljharb> joepie91: no, optional chaining is VERY new
[01:19:37] <joakimk> the unexpected token seems to be ?.icon (the dot)
[01:19:46] <ljharb> joakimk: that feature is in ES2020
[01:19:47] <funnybunny> I am also have another problem where a client is not getting a message send by postMessage when I create a new client with openWindow in the service worker
[01:19:48] <joakimk> so...
[01:19:53] <joakimk> that would explain it :)

[06:15:33] <Xatenev> how can I dispatch a keyboard event that simulates alt + arrowdown?
[06:15:37] *** Joins: owlbynight (sid501016@tinside.irccloud.com)
[06:15:46] <Xatenev> this is what I tried:
[06:15:48] <Xatenev> dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {key: 'ArrowDown', altKey: true}));
[06:15:58] <Xatenev> also 'keypress' instead of 'keydown'
[06:16:05] <Xatenev> both didn't seem to work
[06:16:36] <poiqwepoiqwe> Try logging the event and then using what you logged

[06:19:53] <Xatenev> Its a bit weird.. I'll try to explain what I am doing
[06:20:25] <Xatenev> I have an input field with a datepicker, and my framework automatically applies an alt+arrowdown event listener to it for accessibility purposes
[06:20:42] <Xatenev> we want to have this to also apply when you only press arrowdown, without alt

[06:21:04] <Xatenev> so my idea was to add an eventlistener to ArrowDown, and when this triggers, dispatch another event that triggers alt+arrowdown

[12:43:04] <derjanni> I think the React maintainers need to acknowledge that React is a framework and they should act that way.
[12:43:36] <theskillwithin> they call it a library
[12:43:49] <derjanni> Also I am amazed how frameworks keep having the same issues since 30 years. It seems like history is repeating itself over and over and over again.
[12:44:00] <derjanni> theskillwithin: and I think that's the problem and it shows.
[12:44:23] <theskillwithin> idk, I haven't had many problems with react
[12:44:30] <derjanni> a framework wouldn't allow you to ridiculously mix up dependencies.

[13:03:33] <stenno\OK> just use sqlite
[13:03:35] <theskillwithin> if you go to their website, they call it a library
[13:04:01] <derjanni> The fact that the react framework consists of numerous libraries alone, makes it a framework.
[13:04:51] <derjanni> I am calling the entire Computer Science community to an international congress: "Why React I A Framework - Geneva 2022"
[13:04:53] <silly> would you feel better if we in the channel all agreed with you?
[13:04:59] <theskillwithin> haha
[13:05:21] <theskillwithin> well react itself doesn't do the jsx transforms
[13:06:48] <derjanni> React and its included applications orchestrate the entire process, including the jsx transformation. That screams framework.

[15:49:41] <stenno\OK> think about conways game of life. assume you have a matrix of values, and the value of a cell is calculated from the values of the neighbouring cells
[15:49:53] <stenno\OK> i am wondering how that would look as a data structure
[15:50:28] <stenno\OK> neighbouring cells being the 8 cells around it
[15:51:16] <stenno\OK> i mean i know a few ways but none of them really seem elegant
[15:51:25] <han-solo> https://gist.github.com/jhrr/2b5a60e9efcb573c9cc4
[15:51:54] <stenno\OK> yeah that neighbour function
[15:52:16] <stenno\OK> also it calculates neighbours new on each call
[15:52:20] <stenno\OK> this is not neccessary
[15:52:42] <stenno\OK> the neighbours wont change
[15:52:57] <stenno\OK> it works but it is not elegant at all
[15:53:04] <han-solo> :)
[15:53:32] <stenno\OK> also neighbours does not make a statement about invalid coordinates (negative values and values outside the grid)

[19:49:59] <ThePhilgrim> Hi, this question is not exactly JS-geared.. More webdev. I hope that's okay (sorry if not). I am currently building my website, and I'd like to see the site on my phone. The site is not published yet, but I'd like to see it on an actual phone rather than in responsive mode in devtools. Is there a way to do this?
[19:51:13] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: sure, host it on your machine, expose it to your wifi network, and access it from your phone on the same wifi network. Or use the iPhone simulator.

[20:41:27] <whatsupdoc> Hi, so I'm still stuck on the same problem lol
[20:41:45] <whatsupdoc> I am trying to make a Chrome extension and I'm using `chrome.storage.sync.set`
[20:42:17] <ThePhilgrim> ljharb: I have to do some research on what this mean! :D I'm not so well versed in computer speak! xD
[20:42:27] <whatsupdoc> `chrome.storage.sync.get` returns the value as it should, but when I try to inspect element and find the value inside the browser, it's nowhere to be seen. Am I looking the wrong place?
[20:43:21] <msfninja> <msfninja> so i will ask it again: how do parameter names with an identical name behave when nested. say i have a function with a paremeter `e`. if i have a forEach loop inside whose element parameter is also `e`, will e inside the forEach loop be referring to the element in the loop or the parameter `e` from the initial function?
[20:43:46] <Svitkona> seems fairly easy to test
[20:44:15] <msfninja> considering my laziness it was more feasible to ask it in irc rather than open up a js console and do it myself

[20:54:02] <whatsupdoc> Fault: maybe i have been wasting my time lol, i was using local `chrome.storage.local.set` earlier and it wasn't working so i switched to over to sync. I'm not sure what the difference is

[20:55:58] <whatsupdoc> Should `local` appear in the "Local Storage section?
[20:56:18] <Fault> whatsupdoc: that one i'm not actually sure of, but since it's a different API to the proper local storage API, maybe not?

[21:01:08] <Fault> extensions have an extended set of APIs that "normal" pages do not get access to, hence the need for the separate `chome` object and all the stuff hung on it
[21:01:17] <realies> Fault, it would be strange if the API is protected by, let's say cloudflare's firewall, and if they decide they should show a 'challenge page', the front-end that uses the api would just see an unexpected response 😅

[21:18:18] <obimod> browsers are pretty good at sandboxing. if you can find code that breaks out submit it to mozilla/google/microsoft for like $100k+. Typically malicious code would need to make a network call of some sort in JS. You can check the dev tools / network tab to see if that's happening.
[21:18:32] <msfninja> but malware can be subjective too. a single char could make an ample difference depending on the context
[21:19:30] <obimod> extensions have more vectors, being ran in the background (e.g. miners), so be more wary of extensions

[23:35:32] <humanBird> the html5 preview while I drag, and then rendering any sort of drag animations as the mouse moves.  No extra immutable libraries making your build times a few seconds longer.  No more 1000 lines of code to change the preview.  Just have a preview component and move the mouse around.  Their example is bugged anyways with flickering artifacts
