[02:40:12] <kakuhen> i don't use doom emacs, so i need to ask a dumb question
[02:40:21] <kakuhen> :sly is equivalent to running M-x sly right?

[02:42:23] <anddam> kakuhen: from SLY docs I gathered it would start the lisp subprocess
[02:42:39] <kakuhen> Yes. It also spawns multiple buffers, each with their own purpose

[02:55:58] <kakuhen> Then this is an issue with the CLISP build.
[02:56:03] <kakuhen> I would report this to the void people
[02:56:22] <kakuhen> There seems to be a bug in their builds, but I can't tell where exactly. I don't get these issues on Fedora 34 (or on Mac OS X)
[02:56:41] <anddam> what clisp version?
[02:56:55] <anddam> I am on 2.49
[02:57:09] <kakuhen> Ah, that may be it? I'm using CLISP 2.49.92

[02:57:40] <kakuhen> >Welcome to GNU CLISP 2.49 (2010-07-07) <http://clisp.cons.org/>
[02:57:49] <anddam> sounds a bit old
[02:57:53] <anddam> time to bump the package
[02:57:57] <kakuhen> I don't blame you or the package maintainers, chances are Void has a policy regarding their packages
[02:58:05] <kakuhen> CLISP hasn't seen an official release since 2.49
[02:58:17] <anddam> ah that might be an issue
[02:58:29] <kakuhen> So there are two possibilities: Void's policy is to stick with official releases only, or they just didnt update
[02:58:33] <anddam> I had non-released package being rejected
[02:58:34] <kakuhen> I'm betting on the former
[02:59:08] <anddam> I wasn't worried by that version since SLY docs says "clisp 2.35 at least"

[02:59:51] <kakuhen> I'll have to test with CLISP 2.49 on my machines right now to ensure that this is indeed an issue with their build
[03:00:00] <kakuhen> Or maybe the SLY documentation is out of date now heh
[03:00:37] <kakuhen> anddam: btw, a REPL popping up is the expected behavior of running sly
[03:00:49] <anddam> kakuhen: yep, I figured that much
[03:00:56] <kakuhen> That REPL will always be with you, but you don't have to use it. Then when you revert buffers with lisp-mode, you should have SLY take care of everything else

[03:01:20] <kakuhen> Your modeline will say something like [sly/<inferior-lisp-program>/<package>]
[03:01:47] <kakuhen> and you more or less have a common lisp IDE at that point (you'll see once you use it for a while)
[03:01:51] <anddam> what's the reason for stopping releasing in over a decade? I see before 2010 clisp had at least a release per year
[03:02:46] <kakuhen> I'm not sure. The maintainers just mysteriously stopped working on the project, and over the past decade, it's been held up by a few people.
[03:03:03] <kakuhen> Most people in the common lisp community consider CLISP to be pretty much dead for this reason.

[07:22:50] <parsnip> tusko: i would say, elisp isn't entirely setup for people to learn programming in

[07:23:15] <parsnip> many languages are like that though

[07:24:11] <corwin> sometimes I think the main diffs between the various 4th gen languages is how they expect people to learn, more than whether there is or isn't material intended to make that easy

[07:25:34] <tusko> I have some init.el that I patched together years ago, when I was a mere peasant
[07:25:35] <corwin> configuration-first is a pretty normal way to start with emacs
[07:25:44] <parsnip> tusko: yeah, you don't really need to know elisp to start configuring it
[07:26:02] <tusko> Well, I need to identify what's going on in the init.el
[07:26:25] <tusko> and that involves some basic variable assignments, imports, use-package, set q, etc
[07:26:41] <parsnip> you don't really need use-package, but it's fine if you'd like to
[07:26:55] <edrx> tusko: I don't like the emacs tutorial either =/
[07:27:00] <tusko> Well, like I said, I have an init.el that I made when I knew nothing

[15:13:59] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.205.112)
[15:14:05] <bpalmer> ville:  if so, the "obvious" answer for projects that are rooted in a filesystem tree is to use a directory-local variable

[15:15:07] <codingquark> Amazing, sounds like solved!
[15:15:12] <bpalmer> ville: so you can use a directory local value for that variable . See (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")
[15:16:01] <ville> bpalmer: those need some file on the filesystem right?
[15:16:06] <bpalmer> Yes.
[15:16:20] <ville> ok i'd rather avoid polluting the project root with that then
[15:16:28] <bpalmer> An alternative approach is to write a function that changes the buffer-local value to something else, and run that in a hook
[15:16:32] *** Joins: op2 (~op@user/op2)
[15:16:52] <ville> but there appear to be file local variables as well.. ok i'll look at hooks
[15:18:03] <ville> so i really only use dap-mode for c and c++, i guess i could add the function that sets the variable to those hooks

[15:18:41] <ville> although a new buffer doesn't necessarily have file backing it yet, that could be problem?
[15:19:19] <bpalmer> ville: if you create a buffer with C-x b , yes, that's a problem; if you create a buffer with C-x C-f file-that-doesnt-exist.cc RET  , that's not a problem
[15:19:44] <bpalmer> something like (defun ville/make-local-breakpoints-file () (let ((m (string-match "^\\(/home/whatever/projects/[^/]*\\)/.*" buffer-file-name))) (when m (set (make-local-variable 'dap-breakpoints-file) (concat (match-string 1 buffer-file-name) "/breakpoints.txt")))))

[15:19:56] <ville> i've used: (locate-dominating-file buffer-file-name "makefile") before in my configuration, but not sure what to do there for the C-x b case there
[15:20:23] <bpalmer> c-mode, c++-mode, java-mode, etc all are part of the cc-mode family, and run c-mode-common-hook when the mode becomes active.
[15:20:58] <ville> hold on i'll have to paste that snippet to an editor and format it so i can read it
[15:21:09] <bpalmer> ville: note that a buffer that you create with C-x b also will be in fundamental-mode (or, more properly, the default-major-mode), because c++-mode is selected based on a filename

[15:23:44] <bpalmer> A hook is just a list of functions that will be run at particular times. A major mode foo-mode  will, by convention, run all the functions on a variable named foo-mode-hook when it is first activated in a buffer.

[15:24:42] <ville> i could add it to the file saving hook, if there is one, as well

[15:26:01] <ville> ...is there a particular reason why the emacs manual web pages do not have titles? as in <title> tags?

[15:29:48] <bpalmer> you can verify that it has the correct value and that your function has run with C-h v dap-breakpoints-file RET  
[15:30:09] <bpalmer> if you evaluate that inside a buffer with a buffer-local value, you should see both the local value and a mention that this is just the buffer-local value.
