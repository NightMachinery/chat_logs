[00:03:47] <nobyk> hah got em
[00:07:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> only 2 hr??
[00:07:38] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm prepping for a workshop next week 
[00:07:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> 3 fucking days of me talking
[00:07:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> blah blah blah
[00:08:24] <MarsSpiral> wtf lol
[00:08:27] <vinrock> the only time i had to hold workshops i was too hungover to accomplish anything
[00:08:34] <MarsSpiral> recruiter just hit me up for top hedge fund 
[00:08:40] <MarsSpiral> i guess my resume looks good or something
[00:08:45] <vinrock> yeah
[00:08:50] <vinrock> go work for THE MAN
[00:09:03] <MarsSpiral> honestly i dont think i have the personality for those places
[00:09:10] <MarsSpiral> but fuck it ill apply anyway to see
[00:09:32] <MarsSpiral> my guess is, insanely stressful but pays fuckton
[00:09:39] <monr0e> Ok sanity check. Am I being stupid here, or is it an awful idea to disable UFW on this mailserver? Some blokey in the thread I'm linking below says yes
[00:09:42] <monr0e> er
[00:09:46] <monr0e> says no, rather

[00:10:14] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> anybody know how to make a unifi AP consume it's max power?
[00:10:21] <vinrock> "Best practice: don't use a firewall."
[00:10:25] <vinrock> thanks now im a litle dumber for reading that
[00:10:27] <koollman> monr0e: it's not as awful as it seems. The real awful part is to run a mailsystem in docker, really :)
[00:10:33] <MarsSpiral> allow all to all - firewall issues resolved :))
[00:10:52] <MarsSpiral> ./s 
[00:10:53] <koollman> but otherwise, yeah, in general, docker and firewall mgmt systems don't mix well, so pick one or the other. or pick both, and expect pain
[00:10:54] <monr0e> koollman why so? Apart from docker being a pain in the fucking backside and all that
[00:10:59] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> I've got a POE+ wifi6 AP on monoprice slimeline wire and I want to make sure it's OK before I fully deploy it
[00:11:05] <monr0e> hm
[00:11:13] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> right now i've got it in a coil for the past 5hrs
[00:11:17] <koollman> monr0e: because docker networking will mess with firewall rules. It insert its own rules
[00:11:20] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> and the coil isn't even warm
[00:12:04] <monr0e> Thing is, I also run a little webserver on this machine. The idea of disabling the firewall makes me uneasy
[00:12:04] <koollman> monr0e: and either ufw rules will protect 'too much' for docker stuff to work. Or the docker rules will just be holes in the firewall anyway
[00:12:32] <koollman> monr0e: then think about why you're doing this, then. And have a look at what docker inserts in your firewall, then :)
[00:13:15] <monr0e> It's really just a testbed for me to teach myself about administering my own stack, because that's what I'll be doing once I start with my business in earnest
[00:13:40] <monr0e> v. poor and cannot hire a greybeard :(
[00:14:16] <koollman> my personal opinion would be to isolate mailcow in its own vm. It's not really made to share a system with other things and its usage of docker is unusual
[00:14:26] <vinrock> Telgareith, do you have a dc power supply
[00:14:34] <vinrock> just send 12v over the line to any random device
[00:14:48] <vinrock> crank it up to the ap's max draw
[00:14:49] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> POE+ is 48V
[00:15:05] <vinrock> ok so send 48v

[00:29:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> didn't say that 
[00:29:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> I just think that minimum wage workers get shit on 
[00:30:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> they shouldn't have to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet
[00:30:28] <rpifan> exactly
[00:30:31] <rpifan> i think UBI
[00:30:34] <rpifan> is the only way forward
[00:30:43] <rpifan> that way you can tell that asshole boss to fuck off

[00:30:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> eh i love my boss and my job
[00:31:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> then again i'm not making min wage either

[08:12:13] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE which is widely used today is often called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system, developed by the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, 
[08:12:13] <cryptic1> but it is just a part of the system they use.
[08:12:15] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine‚Äôs resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE with Linux added, or SPACE JAM DEE VE
[08:12:20] <cryptic1> E DEE/Linux. All the so-called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù distributions are really distributions of SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE/Linux

[15:39:11] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> Hahaaa
[15:39:42] <monr0e> its because we run at 240v on 15amp home circuits. Kettles have the ability to pull that much amperage that the grid literally suffers as a result
[15:39:54] <koollman> well, either that, or it would need efficient storage (with quick reactivity) for peak kettle demand :)
[15:40:55] <monr0e> there was a time int eh 90's when more suburban areas would frequently need line replacements because the cable literally destroyed itself with the heat generation
[15:41:34] <Kiernian> yeah, our basic outlets are 110v on whatever circuit. 20amp at the most for residential IIRC. Nothing hits 220v until you get to an electric clothes drier for laundry
[15:42:07] <koollman> I wonder what would be an efficient way to deal with it. Maybe something like flywheel ups. can ramp up stored energy slowly, and release it quickly
[15:42:21] <monr0e> Yep. And our 240v is single phase (afaik). 15amps over 240v is a hell of a lot
[15:42:36] <monr0e> Flywheels are how traditional turbine and coal plants work
[15:43:19] <Kiernian> which is, incidentally, a large part of why electric kettles never took off over here. They suck. It also makes it hilarious to see british reactions when people boil a mug of water in a microwave and drop a teabag in that.
[15:43:22] <monr0e> Problem is you can only put so much load on it. You're asking a hell of a lot during kettle time
[15:43:23] <koollman> and every city should have flywheels for peak kettle time, to offset the peak and avoid buying more power elsewhere ;)

[15:44:07] <monr0e> Whenever an american makes tea with a microwave I die a little inside
[15:44:20] <monr0e> your entire country should be bathed in blood for this
[15:44:20] <koollman> well, it's one way to eat water
[15:44:32] <SirSceptalot> lol
[15:44:37] <Kiernian> it's a dangerous way to heat water
[15:45:13] <monr0e> On a serious note, yeah, one its dangerous, but two it also invites the taste and smell of whatever else has been in the microwave into your tea
[15:45:26] <koollman> Kiernian: not really. just don't overheat it. or be careful about water that is possibly just about to boil
[15:45:46] <monr0e> Its not the risk of burning yourself, its the steam. It will eventually damage the microwave.
[15:46:04] <koollman> it shouldn't. Or it's a crap microwave
[15:46:09] <SirSceptalot> yeah...
[15:46:35] <xe0n> the beard oil i got today is nice
[15:46:37] <Kiernian> boiling water is actually a great way to clean a trashed microwave with crap stuck to it.
[15:46:40] <monr0e> It shoulden't, yeah, but boiling water (as opposed to boiling food with water IN it) allows for a great deal more free-flowing steam
[15:46:40] <SirSceptalot> microwaves are literally designed to make food warm, which always releases air thats MOIST
[15:46:43] <SirSceptalot> m o i s t
[15:46:44] <Kiernian> steams everything off of the walls
[15:46:47] <SirSceptalot> mmmmmmoist
[15:46:58] <monr0e> microwaves can handle that steam, up toa point
[15:47:09] <Kiernian> but yeah, I've seen still standing microwaved water explode into a cloud of steam as soon as the surface tension is broken
[15:47:21] <Kiernian> and since most people couldn't tell you how many watts their microwave is...
[15:47:51] <koollman> yeah, I was thinking more about that danger ... microwave are a good way to heat water over the 'normal' boiling point, without disturbing it
[15:47:55] <monr0e> On the plus side, it doesn't take that much longer to heat a cup of water in a stove kettle if you have a gas stove
[15:48:33] <Kiernian> yeah, I use a stove for mine. even an electric stove doesn't take THAT long
[15:48:57] <monr0e> I h ate electric stoves. I get it, emissions, but it's still ahn awful way to cook
[15:49:18] <Kiernian> yeah, but you can't toast marshmallows over a gas stove
[15:49:29] <monr0e> Can too!
[15:49:29] <Kiernian> well, you can, they'll just taste like shit

[15:54:04] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> I guess UK has the advantage in that you can just tap the kettle and run off and do something else for 5 minutes.
[15:54:09] <koollman> well, you can either update to 20.04, or wait for 22.04 which is not too far now

[15:54:58] <monr0e> koollman: yeah sure, I'm more just concerned about not really knowing enough about ubuntu to manage it if it goes horrendously wrong. I'd ideally like to upgrade it rahter than reinstall it
[15:55:02] <Kiernian> I mean, if you learn how long it takes your particular microwave to boil x ounces of water when you put it in a particular mug in the center, then yeah, you can just set it and walk off
[15:55:49] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> Do American kettlewaves come with little cups that say "This amount is 60 seconds on full power"
[15:55:55] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> That's the only thing I can think of
[15:55:56] <Kiernian> or fancier microwaves have plug-in temperature probes. I've owned a few of those. cool stuff, set temperature, hit button, it stops itself
[15:56:02] <monr0e> If you put the water you need in the kettle, which for me is obviously a single cup, you have enough time to fill the kettle, then wash your cup and fetch a teabag. Then the kettle is done and you have hot water ready
[15:56:18] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> Ah if you put more water in it'll take longer of course

[16:02:58] <monr0e> As does my mailserver, but its honestly fine
[16:03:11] <koollman> depending on how old the old laptop is, if you have usb3 on it ... it's a decent cheap way to attach storage

[19:05:47] <mistiry> arlion: wait til you get bots. also i *highly* suggest Nilhaus Master Class' blueprint book.
[19:06:09] <mistiry> arlion: it is a fan-fucking-tasting game
[19:06:27] <mistiry> and i will buy any and all DLC for that game (there is none yet, all updates have been free)
[19:06:30] <arlion> mistiry: mmm.. is that a bunch of prebuilt blueprints that make the game easier
[19:07:10] <mistiry> arlion: so, bots can build/destroy/repair for you. blueprints tell them what to do. Nilhaus' Master Class blueprint book has extremely vetted designs for maximum efficiency
[19:07:28] <arlion> im currently playing in a god mode, but i think ill switch soon and play sandbox again
[19:07:33] <mistiry> need a big smelting factory? plop down blueprint, let the bots build it for you

[19:09:03] <arlion> oh dam. I'll watch a youtube video on how to do it
[19:09:09] <mistiry> learn how the mechanic works 
[19:09:44] <arlion> yeah, as a new player im finding messing around in god mode is the best way to learn the game
[19:09:46] <mistiry> it will blow your mind how fucking cool it is to kick off a massive project and have literally thousands of bots doing the work for you
[19:09:57] <arlion> oh that just sounds better than sex
[19:10:16] <mistiry> it is fabulous
[19:10:26] <mistiry> now i want to play again LOL
[19:10:34] <mistiry> and we just did a playthrough a few weeks back
[19:11:17] <mistiry> arlion:  https://factoriobin.com/post/Y52EhJ74
[19:11:24] <mistiry> thats the blueprint book
[19:11:42] <arlion> nooo. this looks liek cheating
[19:11:55] <mistiry> not at all. 
[19:12:10] <mistiry> blueprints are designed to be shared and used by others
[19:12:44] <mistiry> nilhaus's specifically are very very good. because he works out the actual math and stuff in his designs to make them the most efficient
[19:12:45] <vinrock> this game looks rad
[19:12:58] <mistiry> even using his blueprints, you will want/need to make plenty of your own
[19:13:05] <mistiry> or modifications to his to fit your need
[19:13:18] <mistiry> vinrock: it is amazing
[19:13:55] <mistiry> wait til you learn about using a main bus line to feed your items

[19:14:38] <mistiry> fritzwastaken: all it takes is seeing someone new is playing, and i get excited again
[19:14:42] <mistiry> DrGibby probably does too
[19:14:56] <lancehead> I get that with DayZ lol, I know the feeling 
[19:15:01] <mistiry> meh, idk. i really enjoy it multiplayer so would need a group of folks that want to play thru it
[19:16:06] <mistiry> arlion: the phrase for factorio is "The Factory Must Grow". if you havent learned why yet, you will :D
[19:16:23] <arlion> yeah, ive gotten myself jammed many times
[19:16:43] <arlion> currently i have 3 different trains.. and then i look at some other designs and my jaw just drops.
[19:16:54] <arlion> there are some brilliant mfs out there.
[19:17:05] <mistiry> it becomes much easier with bots, but you will find yourself eventually just completely ripping out entire factories to replace with something new. or re-running lines for seemingly miles because you need room.
[19:17:09] *** Joins: Trieste (T@user/pilgrim)
[19:17:17] <mistiry> massive smelting op? bots - delete it!
[19:17:28] <mistiry> plop in new upgraded blueprint. bots - build it!
[19:17:29] <arlion> i just want to keep playing to just get to that level
[19:18:27] <mistiry> trains are a bit of a beast to design well. a well designed system has basically a main bus for the trains, so they share the main thoroughfare, but then split off to the stations they need

[23:11:04] <mistiry> i never really thought about it
[23:11:16] <PrincessZoey> I have https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSPEED-POWERPLAY-Wireless-Compatibility/dp/B0716ZFWWV mistiry
[23:11:17] <misspwn> mine isn't programmed for anything though and my gaming is probably limited to killing my Sims
[23:11:17] <mistiry> old mice probably were fine, but gaming mice with thumb buttons and such
[23:11:20] <sintax> DRM is a pain in the rear
[23:11:36] <misspwn> it can be programmed, i just don't have it set up 
[23:11:52] <mistiry> speaking of sims, saw a sims 5 trailer the other day

[23:12:27] <vinrock> you dont have a business account
[23:12:30] <PrincessZoey> expensive, but I like it. it feels weird using thumb buttons with my left thumb though
[23:12:33] <vinrock> that isnt uncommon
[23:12:35] <Hunterkll> @onenerdyguy yea, DPM if someone fucks it up can go retardedly sideways
[23:12:51] <Hunterkll> but that's what you get with multi-datacenter scale software

[23:13:05] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> its not a port block
[23:13:09] <vinrock> ive seen res accounts open more than blocked, but i have encountered this in the past

[23:14:00] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> meh, i'm tired of their games on that, so went Veeam
[23:14:03] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> it was either Veeam or Rubrik
[23:14:11] <sintax> what software you using with DRM?
[23:14:14] <Hunterkll> we've got... a menagerie of backup products
[23:14:17] <Hunterkll> sintax: DPM.... not DRM

[23:14:40] <yuken> Hunterkll, <3
[23:14:46] <Hunterkll> we use it for D2D/deduping/D2D2T/D2T/C2T/etc backup systems
[23:15:01] <Hunterkll> insanely powerful, but it is what it is.... always funny installing a VSS daemon inside linux VMs for backups lol
[23:15:24] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> yeah...the big thing I hated abotu it is it being so VM/agent focused vs hypervisor focused
[23:15:48] <Hunterkll> it can be both, but a lot of the sp ecific application awareness.... well, requires agents for other backup solutions as well 
[23:15:59] <Hunterkll> veeam, rubrik, netbackup, etc we all have to deploy a smattering of agents 
[23:16:02] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> i used commvault a previous jobs, it is very powerful but kinda tricky to get set up right
[23:16:09] <Hunterkll> for shit like database systems, sharepoint, etc
[23:16:42] <Hunterkll> DPM you install the VSS daemon and it can use hypervisor level backups like any other for consistent backups .... otherwise can do 'crash consistent' backups like every other product too without VSS installed 
[23:16:50] <Hunterkll> i was rather happy when they added ESXi support 
[23:17:21] <Hunterkll> it also, oddly enough, has one of the best tape management/inventory systems i've ever used

[23:29:59] <PrincessZoey> wait naked news still exists?!
[23:30:11] <signofzeta> how's their news coverage?  are they a reputable source for information and opinions?
[23:30:19] <Disconnect> Used to work for their video contractor. Sounds great (pick your sides) but invariably the video issues were on the admin's non-preferred side. And usually involved skipping around a bunch, then having to watch several minutes to verify problem, then same for fix. (Actually watching, compression artifacts, etc)
[23:30:35] <Disconnect> Strangely enough, they were decent.
[23:30:44] <signofzeta> "Zoom in on her bush, I think I see compression artifacts"
[23:30:51] <Disconnect> Nothing in depth but not bad for a quick daily update
[23:31:05] <Disconnect> Nah for that we had the masters. Those were full uncompressed monster beasts.
[23:31:43] <vinrock> its gonnna be depressing if i watch naked news later n and its more balanced and informative than anything else out there

[23:32:44] <Disconnect> Nah. They're Canadian, plenty of relatively balanced news comes that way. Especially when you don't look for deep investigations, just news updates.
