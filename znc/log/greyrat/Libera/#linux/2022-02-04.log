[01:54:23] <ayecee> i didn't think PA was involved in that part. that's usually hardware- or driver-level.

[06:39:09] <structoha> Maybe i should explain what i was originally intending to do. I am willing to install an openvpn server on the vps, openvpn client on my home router. i want to allow p2p connections on port 44158, that means i want to allow incoming tcp syn (and established) connection on port 44158 to a local machine in my lan. So i installed openvpn, installed iptables and thought everything will go well, but to
[06:39:11] <rascul> otherwise you'll need some combination of iw, wpa_supplicant, and probably dhclient
[06:39:11] <structoha> me and after inspecting the traffic with tcpdump 44158 is still a closed port, so instead of doing all that i disabled port forwarding and started from scratch: i am here to ask how can i run a simple programm on my vps listening on port 44158 and make sure the port is open? to my knowledge using nmap gives me a good feedback

[06:46:48] <znf> I asked you "what makes you think the port is closed?"
[06:47:29] <tm512> well using this 750Ti with nvidia's proprietary driver is kinda driving me up the wall. it seems like I'm consistently getting frame drops or duplicate frames being presented to screen, even though this renderer is able to run at nearly 200fps on this GPU when I have vsync off

[06:49:12] <znf> ie: what random commands did you copy/paste from the internet that resulted in you thinking that your port is "closed"
[06:49:31] <structoha> The output of nmap for port 44158 is "filtered", according to nmap the scan is blocked by a firewall or it is unknown, in other words i assume i am getting an ICMP error on the way
[06:49:31] <tm512> it seems like running picom as a compositor might be making the issue worse but without picom running I get screen tearing even in applications with explicit vsync
[06:50:23] <tm512> and the alternative to picom that I've seen presented, enabling "Force Composition Pipeline" in the driver settings, causes performance to take a complete nosedive, like it's just not an option here :/

[07:51:53] <cdown> not surprising since he hasn't touched mm in a very long time
[07:52:32] <cdown> nowadays if anything swap files are a lot less complicated than swap partitions, because swap partitions have to implement their own logic for all kinds of things that we get for free from the filesystem.

[08:15:18] <newpy> I'm wondering if apt install ubuntu-desktop did this
[08:15:29] <cdown> znf: so, our goal as the kernel is to not use 100% of memory, but to use almost 100% of it. in fact, as close as possible to 100% while still having enough headroom to immediately fill new page faults
[08:15:46] <cdown> the watermark is the point at which we say "hey, this is getting a bit close to 100%, maybe we should take some stuff out to free up space"
[08:16:06] <znf> newpy, that's your wifi card's transmit power rate, that's fine too; signal level goes from 0 to -100, with -100 being "dead", but sane values start from -40-50, you'd probably get -30 if you'd hug your router with your laptop
[08:16:18] <cdown> if you are seeing such high kswapd usage, it probably means it's fighting desperately to try to keep it under the watermark, and failing

[08:16:37] <donofrio> anyone here run wsl2?
[08:17:07] <cdown> that could be for a few reasons -- that the watermark is too high, that the memory consumption is genuinely too high (unlikely since otherwise judging by what you said the server keeps on running fine), or some other pathological behaviour
[08:17:08] <znf> cdown, interesting, would my disks usage % (iops) be a cause in that?

[08:18:43] <znf> this is mostly a read intensive operation, I barely have around ~10 IOPS in writes, but I read at ~3000MB/s or such across the array

[08:20:22] <znf> I'll see about giving swap a chance again, although I specifically did not use it because I didn't want to sacrifice any read performance on the raid0 array
[08:20:22] <cdown> if it's pure reads, it could be just that we're pushing too much stuff out of memory for page cache if it's not O_DIRECT.

[08:25:40] <znf> not to mention the disks are enterprise class and and they supposedly do 75k IOPS / 550MB/s, and seeing 100%++ in iostat at 300MB/s with barely ~1000-2000 r/s is heartbreaking

[11:06:19] <labrador> I don't really understand how forward secrecy works...like it says that for a protocol to be forward secret it needs to not leak session keys even when long term keys are leaked

[11:06:27] <tm512> does this even when I've set the adaptive clocking into "prefer maximum performance" mode
[11:06:33] <labrador> The problem is DH doesn't even use Long term Session keys....
[11:06:37] <labrador> So what gives
[11:07:19] <jinxx> When I boot, all of my storage drives are using `none` i/o scheduler. how do i set other i/o scheduler, so when i boot its set to those??
[11:08:23] <masoudd> diffie hellman is the process which two parties can establish a shared secret over an unencrypted channel
[11:08:49] <jinxx> ik i can just `kyber > /sys/block/sdx/queue/scheduler` but its changes back when i restart. how do i make it permanent

[11:14:23] <masoudd> labrador, I think what you read meant to say that when you use a long used secret to encrypt your communication, anyone who records these encrypted comms and later finds that secret can go back and decrypt your comms. Now if you do a DH over this encrypted (with the long used secret) comms and then switch to the new secret that DH gave you, then this attack vector won't work
[11:15:02] <labrador> hmmm

[15:11:04] <tirnanog> jelly: you could just use cat on the remote side but, if you feel that you would benefit from a buffer there, pv would be a fair choice. dd isn't really designed for this.

[15:11:54] <tirnanog> that is, pv goes out of its way to to maintain a good fill rate at the same time as writing.
[15:12:00] <jelly> I might remember to use fullblock next time or not.  LVs are always 1MiB size-aligned anyway
[15:12:15] *** Joins: mrfb (~MrFooBar@gateway/tor-sasl/mrfb)
[15:12:18] <tirnanog> I would recommend against it. you'll probably just make it slower (certainly no better).
[15:12:22] <jjakob> I always use iflag=fullblock
[15:12:30] <tirnanog> because it will not write while it is busy filling up that 1MB buffer.
[15:12:54] <tirnanog> again, dd isn't designed to be a pipe buffer.
[15:12:59] <jjakob> I've had one time where it wrote noncomplete blocks
[15:13:04] <jelly> nod.  That's going to make it slightly slower in theory, but the kernel defers writes later in the pipeline anyway
[15:13:56] <jjakob> but you need to make sure the input data is divisible by the block size, or you'll maybe have a partial block at the end that won't get copied?

[17:25:43] <libh> Enjoy ejjfunky
[17:25:43] <ananke> slackware is a distro made for its creator. if it happens to meet your particular niche needs, that's a pure coincidence
[17:25:51] <labrador> libh, it literally didn't even use PAM till now
[17:25:55] <labrador> Its a lil stupid
[17:25:57] <libh> And?
[17:26:06] <labrador> ok
[17:26:11] <libh> Slackware is meant to be as conservative as possible. Not SNS.
[17:26:28] <ejjfunky> what init system? systemd?
[17:26:33] <libh> sysv actually
[17:26:39] <ejjfunky> cool
[17:26:41] <labrador> libh, conservative doesn't mean good
[17:26:45] <labrador> SysV is hard...
[17:26:54] <libh> Change for the sake of change doesn't mean good either. It goes both ways.
[17:27:01] <ananke> lack of pam is certainly one of the major factors why I stopped using it ~15 years ago or more
[17:27:05] <blackgatonegro> Slackware predates Windows 95 that's how old it is.

[17:28:16] <libh> I don't see why kids these days need to lash out against a distro that they don't even use.
[17:28:18] <mrfb> jokes aside, other than the nostalgia, it's hard to go back using slackware when there are plenty of really good modern linux distros
[17:28:19] <ananke> half of the things are still buried in rc.S, rc.M, etc, you can't control them individually via sysv like interface

[23:06:10] <jro1> just install ubuntu. Opps. Do-over. Sometimes that happens.
[23:06:28] <jro1> luckily it doesn't take half a day like Windows.
[23:06:30] <jro1> ten minutes

[23:07:37] <newpy_> I'll be back in a few hours, want to have irc on my backup pc when I re-install just in case
[23:07:43] <labrador> Its so black boxed I'd rather not touch it

[23:12:02] <labrador> znf, nobody wants to touch that black box
[23:12:03] <matsaman> th0n1: it's the '&' at the end that does that
[23:12:17] <jro1> znf, I have ben doing this for a living for over 16 years. IT DOES NOT TAKE 15 MINUTES TO INSTALL WINDOWS. NOW STOP LYING
[23:12:19] <znf> back to th0n1's issue, aren't jobs coupled to the currently running shell?
[23:12:29] <znf> jro1, prove me wrong
[23:12:31] <DLange> th0n1: getting the job back under shell control is non-trivial. There is reptyr that can help you.
[23:12:46] <th0n1> DLange: matsaman znf : I went out of the shell and opened another shell
[23:12:47] <jro1> TyOU MADE THE CLAIM, IDIOT. THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON YOU. RECORD IT

[23:16:30] <znf> th0n1, I believe the jobs are "tied" to the current shell tough, so it makes sense that "jobs" is no longer reporting it
[23:17:06] <znf> either way, why do you want to bring it to foreground? just kill it, not like "ping localhost" is something important, is it?
