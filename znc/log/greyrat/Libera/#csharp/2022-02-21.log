[01:45:29] <pitfall> is there a built-in cache class somewhere in .NET?
[01:46:09] <Suchiman> pitfall: you mean like https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.caching.memorycache?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0
[01:46:41] <pitfall> I was wondering if that was it :)
[01:49:18] <pitfall> considing caching ImapTokens (and Task<ImapToken>?) to solve https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/1335
[01:49:31] <pitfall> I'm hard-coding a handful of really common ones
[01:50:14] <pitfall> the problem is that the IMAP spec allows upper and lowercase atoms
[01:50:17] <pitfall> :\
[01:50:42] <Suchiman> pitfall: normalize to lowercase :P ? who cares about th edifference
[01:51:04] <pitfall> well, I considered that, but my tokenizer tokenizes w/o context
[01:51:22] <pitfall> it's up to the higher-level code to determine if it's a protocol token or a user-string
[01:51:49] <pitfall> protocol tokens are case-insensitive, user-strings are not
[01:52:40] <pitfall> so that limits usefulness of the cache, unfortunately, or I could hard-code the most common protocol tokens
[01:52:52] <pitfall> and just have the cache for everything less common and/or user-string
[01:53:16] <pitfall> DAMN YOU MARK CRISPIN! DAMN YOU!
[01:54:57] <pitfall> I am hoping to avoid having to have a full stack of sync and async APIs
[01:55:17] <pitfall> and just have the sync APIs wrap the async APIs like I'm doing now, passing a doAsync bool all the way down the stack
[01:55:31] <pitfall> I don't want code duplication :(

[01:57:50] <Suchiman> pitfall: you must suffer, choose the form of your suffering
[01:58:35] <pitfall> it's interesting that SslStream's internals all seem to be XyzAsync while the public sync APIs just call the XyzAsync internals
[01:58:41] <pitfall> pretty much what I do
[02:00:46] <pitfall> now if only MemoryCache allowed me to key off of ReadOnlySpan<byte>...

[02:01:00] <DevJohnC> does the BCL have a key-less collection that can perform lookups in O(1) time rather than, say, List<string> which would be O(n) for a Contains call?
[02:01:01] <Suchiman> pitfall: well the problem is that ReadOnlySpan is stack only :P
[02:01:14] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: HashSet<T>?
[02:01:38] <DevJohnC> ah that might be it!
[02:02:24] <pitfall> :)
[02:02:29] <DevJohnC> mucho thank you
[02:02:40] <pitfall> Suchiman yea, I was going to look into ValueTask<T>
[02:03:25] <DevJohnC> pitfall, well, if you wanna cache something that's on stack you have to move it to the heap, you'd have to copy it to a byte[] or w/e
[02:03:46] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: also mind that HashSet<T> does not allow duplicates and the Add method returns false if the item could not be added due to being a duplicate
[02:04:07] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, which is perfect :)
[02:04:16] <pitfall> DevJohnC of course, my plan was to do lookups based on a ReadOnlySpan<T>, but then convert that into a string if it wasn't already in the cache
[02:05:58] <pitfall> FWIW, I'm also trying to keep string allocations down while I work with byte[]'s

[02:59:22] <pitfall> there's a mix of ImapTOken allocations along with Task<T> allocations and overhead from the compiler's generated async fu
[03:00:08] <pitfall> oops, this is the comment I meant: https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/1335#issuecomment-1046294968
[03:00:22] <pitfall> his imap sync program is bloating out to 1.5 GB
[03:01:14] <pitfall> or 250 MB per thread
[03:02:11] <DevJohnC> what leads you to think caching ImapToken instances will fix it?
[03:02:32] <DevJohnC> so you wouldn't have to call the method that's allocating Task<ImapToken> ?
[03:05:40] <pitfall> my thinking was to have ImapTokens and their corresponding Task<ImapToken>'s cached
[03:05:53] <pitfall> in order to reuse them
[03:07:35] <DevJohnC> are you producing a ton of identical tokens?
[03:11:08] <pitfall> yes
[03:11:29] <DevJohnC> in a loop? or what's the scenario?
[03:11:59] <pitfall> essentially, yea
[03:12:34] <pitfall> so in his sample program, he's requesting the UID and MODSEQ values for all of his messages
[03:13:24] <pitfall> so the server responds with something like: "* <index value> FETCH (UID <uid value> MODSEQ <modseq value>)\r\n" for each message
[03:13:51] <pitfall> each word gets parsed as a token, essentially
[03:14:45] <pitfall> and so each message will replicate the *, FETCH, (, UID, MODSEQ, ), and "\r\n" tokens
[03:15:27] <pitfall> you'll notice that I added static readonly ImapTokens for *, (, ), and "\r\n"
[03:15:53] <pitfall> that more-or-less halved the number of tokens that get created
[03:16:08] <DevJohnC> so I'm guessing the Task<ImapToken> is like a "ReadNextTokenAsync" style method?
[03:16:16] <pitfall> yep
[03:16:30] <pitfall> exactly right
[03:17:59] <DevJohnC> so the calling method is holding onto the tasks for some reason?
[03:18:27] <pitfall> right now, I essentially have a public sync and async API and they each call a DoSomethingAsync (args, bool doAsync)
[03:19:04] <pitfall> they aren't being held onto, at least not afaict when using dotMemory - they all get cleaned up right away
[03:19:46] <DevJohnC> if they're cleaned up how are they contributing to memory bloat?
[03:20:27] <pitfall> probably because the GC only sweeps every once in a while, so even tho the object is no longer referenced anywhere, the GC hasn't compacted

[03:20:43] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:20:59] <pitfall> the "loop" is probably tight enough that the GC isn't keeping up
[03:22:55] <pitfall> that's why his memory graph builds and builds, then drops to a low usage again, repeat
[03:23:54] <pitfall> sadly my test account only has 96 messages so I don't see that cycle, heh
[03:24:06] <pitfall> but if I take snapshots throughout, they aren't still allocated
[03:24:46] <DevJohnC> couldn't you use an async method to populate a buffer and then read tokens sequentially from the buffer?
[03:25:20] <DevJohnC> so your ImapToken parsing method isn't Task<ImapToken> at all, since it'd just be parsing what's in a pre-populated buffe
[03:26:37] <pitfall> that's kinda what I do, the problem is that that method needs to refill the buffer if a token just happens to cross read boundaries
[03:26:55] <pitfall> gotta head to the in-laws for dinner
[03:27:10] <pitfall> but I appreciate the thoughts, they have all been good ideas
[03:27:16] <DevJohnC> have the parsing method return a result that indicates an under-populated buffer and then repopulate it

[09:47:29] <bkool> good evening or morning.
[09:49:07] <tsujp> hey so with Moq if you mock a method and define a `Callback` (in moq) it appears that callback only fires once?
[09:49:15] <biberu> tsujp: why do you need to mock something that's internal to another assembly? you shouldn't have dependencies directly on that
[09:49:25] <tsujp> I don't anymore biberu was just about to say hehe
[09:49:35] <biberu> ah, great :)
[09:49:54] <tsujp> In this case it was a response object from an azure api call (which I think is dumb to not allow us to inspect?) but happily not needed here
[09:50:15] <tsujp> Anyway yeah with the SUT, I make 2 calls to azure. I've got this mocked, it works great _except_ the mock `Callback` only fires for _one_ of the invocations
[09:50:33] <tsujp> The SUT code is correct because if I comment out the first call to azure in the SUT, the mock callback fires for the second
[09:50:42] <tsujp> If I leave both in, it fires for the 1st, then ignores the second
[09:51:05] <tsujp> Short of copy-pasting the mock code here to define another callback is there a way in Moq to say "run this callback for _all_ invocations of the mocked method"?
[09:51:11] <tsujp> Surely there is no..? I feel this would be quite common
[09:51:26] <tsujp> Or should I define the mock by discriminating on the arguments the mocked method is invoked with?
[09:52:24] <biberu> sorry, don't know, i try to avoid the need for mocking
[09:54:08] <tsujp> SO says do this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31033032
[09:54:39] <tsujp> Idk this feels strange to me, but then again in the callback im switching on the parameters of the invocation, my way feels DRYer but I can see why the SO answer is what it is
[09:54:49] <tsujp> Because of the whole `It.Is` discrimination moq provides
[09:55:03] <tsujp> I mean, if you use IoC you need mocking no? ;)

[13:32:31] <bomb> now you tell us to ignore that?

[13:33:24] <tsujp> it throws an exception bcause the mocked method does not `.ReturnAsync` anything

[13:45:17] <Suchiman> when you're getting invited into a teams meeting with your CEO and a laywer...
[13:45:33] <Suchiman> and you're finally getting rid of that one customer that has been bugging you for the last few years <3
[13:46:03] <Suchiman> feels good man xD
[13:46:35] <MatthiasVance> "and a lawyer" xD
[13:46:39] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: Also, very nice!
[13:47:00] <MatthiasVance> Ah this wasn't a FYI meeting for you but rather the actual discussion with the lawyer?
[13:47:01] <Suchiman> 11:16:40 <+MatthiasVance> "and a lawyer" xD??? xD
[13:47:28] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: no i was supposed to extract some info from the db to show that the customer is full of shit xD
[13:47:40] <fredrikhr> I felt uncomfortable using Postman and needed to script a little bit more than what is feasable in Postman. It bugged me that I had a too little control of where sensitive data in Postman ended up. So I looked for text-based HTTP client solutions that I can use in an editor and easily with Git. Started of with REST Client for VS Code
[13:48:05] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: Ahh lol
[13:48:13] <fredrikhr> Then I hit the limitations of REST Client, and now I have been using httpyac within VS Code and that's great!
[13:56:32] <Suchiman> mhm when you break off a row from your chocolate bar uncleanly, then the next time you break off another row that row will also come off uncleanly >:(
[14:01:59] <alguien> So the recommended strategy is not the secure one? See "HSTS and API projects" vs "Require HTTPS" at ttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl
[14:03:41] <alguien> Does anyone else's linkedin preview 404 for the HTTP url despite returning a 301 Moved Permanently redirect to HTTPS?
[14:20:13] <Suchiman> alguien: well the best solution is to not serve HTTP traffic and have your domain HSTS preload enabled :P
[14:27:26] <tsujp> So I'm trying to mock `NetworkManagementClient` method `SecurityRules.StartCreateOrUpdateAsync`. I can mock the call but not the response type, see above. I could solve this by deleting a check in the production code which checks the response code in that method, should I?
[14:27:47] <tsujp> i.e. is this enough `Response? fooBar = await _client.SecurityRules.StartCreateOrUpdateAsync()`
[14:28:07] <tsujp> Or should I be doing, as I do now, a check on fooBar after `fooBar.GetRawResponse.Contains("202");`?
[14:28:26] <tsujp> Deleting that second line will solve my problem of not being able to construct a dummy type to return in my mock
[14:31:37] <alguien> Suchiman, probably. Would be even worse for linkedin though. I reckon the problem with its preview is that it already doesn't act like a browser, let alone when it would have to get a list from Google and add change the schema itself
[14:42:11] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: So what kind of customer was this, I mean more in the sense of .. were they lying about stuff or misrepresenting stuff?

[14:52:52] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: nah they have been refusing to pay for a while :P xD because of GDPR requirements, as in, if there's no contract anymore, should we holdon to the data stored in the cloud (that they argue they don't have) or delete it

[16:42:18] <MatthiasVance> Right now
[16:42:32] <jmer> how?

[16:43:27] <jmer> I don't think that's fair to my employer
[16:43:37] <jmer> there are lots of good things here... But this code is just... A mess
[16:44:23] <MatthiasVance> xD
[16:46:31] <jmer> I thought I was close to completion
[16:46:40] <jmer> but then I discovered that there are more than one way product information is fetched
[16:46:59] <jmer> and apparantly the method used in this context, doesn't carry the information in this point of "time"
[16:47:12] <jmer> even though the properties are there they aren't initialized...
[16:47:31] <jmer> So now I have to fetch a bunch of timestamps and cache these, to look up the data.
[16:47:40] <jmer> because the right way would require me to rewrite the entire way this is handled
[16:47:57] <jmer> and this could have rippling effects into the webshop even though this is code responsible for integrating data between two systems.
[16:50:21] <MatthiasVance> ðŸ˜±
[16:51:09] <MatthiasVance> jmer: That's why I hate the reuse of models in different contexts that have no connection
[16:51:34] <jmer> MatthiasVance: That's not the only issue :(
[16:51:49] <jmer> It's like... I can't fathom why these data integrations wasn't done in a solution by themselves
[16:51:49] <MatthiasVance> Oh I'm sure xD

[16:55:37] <hseg> culture clash again -- what's the "C# way" of modelling a collection of functions? a collection of static classes inheriting from an abstract static class?
[16:56:26] <hseg> (in my specific case, all the functions are from the same source type, so _could_ tuple them up and just use plain functions)
[16:56:38] <hseg> (but that feels clumsy)

[17:53:28] <jmer> Especially when said class has a "Setup" method where 80% of the variables are initialized
[17:54:28] <hseg> hrm... in talking, I just realized there is a more OO way of doing this -- have a generic Sampler class contain both the projections and the data of the necessary type, and construct it as necessary
[17:55:04] <hseg> jmer: is there a way to cut out the other 20%/make them a different class's problem?
[17:55:17] <jmer> There always is, isn't there? xD
[17:55:30] <jmer> the reason I'm bitchin is because they didn't do this up front.
[17:56:02] <hseg> jmer: bc I had a similar issue, where just one field was messing up my entire design, making the class nonstatic and needing a Setup method, when I realized I could push that field's responsibility to the calling code
[17:56:44] <hseg> jmer: oof, I feel you, the coupling in this codebase is completely whack
[17:56:52] <jmer> I just realized that the method that is called is caching this data all ready, so using a private class varaible to "cache" this is kinda pointless.
[17:57:08] <hseg> lol

[19:47:45] <lz_> am I missing an obvious productivity tool?
[19:48:03] <hseg> hrm. for some reason GetDiseaseInsuranceCoverages works, but GetPensionInsuranceCoverage returns "No HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI" http://ix.io/3QiC

[19:51:24] <DevJohnC> yeesssh, vector space modelling is tricky to grok
[19:52:38] <DevJohnC> did you know if you have two vectors: "0, 0, 1" and "0, 0, 100" they score the same using cosine similarity?
[19:53:14] * hseg facepalms
[19:53:24] <hseg> was hitting the staging server instead of localhost
[19:53:36] <DevJohnC> and if you have "0.25, 0.25" and "100, 100" those rank the same
[19:59:05] <Tobbi_> Any idea how to ask for advice regarding publishing for asp.net core projects?
[19:59:42] *** Quits: Carko (~Darko@84-255-241-35.static.t-2.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:59:58] <Suchiman> Tobbi_: how can you even core if you don't even know how to ask
[20:00:28] <Tobbi_> Suchiman: I am confused by the multiple projects...I have ASP.NET Core, there's Visual Studio, there's Razor tooling...I don't know which area it belongs to
[20:00:44] <Tobbi_> I added a target to the .csproj file...
[20:00:47] <irwiss> lz_: there's like a shitton of all kinds of file managers for windows... even stuff like totalcommander which is like old nc.com
[20:01:04] <Suchiman> Tobbi_: why you adding targets? just dotnet publish -c Release :P
[20:01:21] <Tobbi_> I'm adding targets so that I can clear bin and obj
[20:01:21] <lz_> irwiss: but isn't there something to manage windows in general and not just folders
[20:01:33] <Suchiman> Tobbi_: why
[20:01:57] <Tobbi_> Because if I don't, I sometimes get this: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38552
[20:01:59] <irwiss> lz_: ah like random windows... you can try using exposition and multiple desktops
[20:02:00] <lz_> irwiss: imagine this: you press a shortcut, then type a few letters, and the window that matches your input the most shows up instantly
[20:02:35] <lz_> multiple desktops just adds an indirection
[20:02:42] <irwiss> yeah that's prolly too advanced on windows
[20:03:15] <lz_> irwiss: when I get these ideas I wonder if I should write such tools
[20:03:37] <lz_> or if there's something that already exists and do this well
[20:03:46] <Tobbi_> Do I ask on the visual studio feedback site?
[20:03:54] <Tobbi_> Or where would I even ask questions regarding targets?
[20:04:41] <lz_> you could even do something like press a direction, then type letters, and the window would be docked to that corner
[20:05:00] <lz_> or sth to select a corner with the mouse
[20:05:23] <lz_> hold a key: then the mouse lets you "hover" dockable regions of the screen, type a couple of letters, bam. here's your window docked
[20:05:52] <lz_> and/or use the wheel to quickly cycle to matching windows
[20:06:11] <Suchiman> Tobbi_: stackoverflow tagging msbuild?
[20:06:27] <Tobbi_> Not sure I have a stackoverflow account.
[20:06:32] <Tobbi_> But it could be worth a try.
[20:06:46] <Suchiman> Tobbi_: and you call yourself developer?
[20:06:54] <Tobbi_> :D
[20:07:03] <Tobbi_> I call myself everything else but not a developer
[20:07:04] <lz_> or some "master" window to let you arrange windows in a sort of bin. almost like the "task view" thing but better
[20:07:21] <lz_> Suchiman: i don't have a stackoverflow account :(((
[20:07:49] <Suchiman> time to clean up the channel and kick the fake developers...
[20:07:53] <Tobbi_> :D
[20:08:04] <Tobbi_> I'll deal with it tomorrow.
[20:08:09] <Tobbi_> I feel like not working anymore.
[20:09:18] <lz_> Tobbi_: i started working 10mins ago and I already stopped probably for the day :D
[20:09:21] <Tobbi_> :D
[20:09:45] <lz_> too many open windows
[20:09:49] <lz_> can't work
[20:09:52] <Tobbi_> Actually, let me check the production server.
[20:09:59] <Tobbi_> To see if some Office tasks hung...
[20:10:19] <Tobbi_> Nope, all good.
[20:10:20] <Tobbi_> Aight
[20:12:28] <lz_> last week I almost did nothing except go to sport, and this week is probably going to be the same

[20:51:33] <DevJohnC> the crux of things right now is that I have a vector that represents my "document" and I wanted to apply weights to some of the dimensions to control which dimensions are more significant to computing similarity
[20:51:57] <DevJohnC> but cosine similarity will give you the same score for two vectors that are scaled versions of each other
[20:52:24] <bomb> vector as in data structure, or vector in physics?
[20:52:38] <DevJohnC> so, [1,1] gets the same score as [10,10], despite [10,10] denoting a vector that should score higher

[20:53:51] *** Quits: duds- (~duds-@user/duds) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[20:54:10] <DevJohnC> I just found out that those scores are the same because actual document relevancy (ie, a text search engine) uses euclidean distance to normalize the vectors to account for document length
[20:54:16] <DevJohnC> which, in my scenario, has no meaning
[20:55:56] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Doesn't a vector have 3 components? ;)
[20:56:09] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, a vector can have any number of dimensions
[20:56:10] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Also sounds like an interesting topic to research and engineer!
[20:56:59] <DevJohnC> it's certainly an interesting subject matter, but super mathy, and the relevant research sources are papers from cambrige and such lol
[20:57:07] <DevJohnC> it's an investment to parse them accurately

[20:57:32] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Ah yeah, is it a personal thing or for work?
[20:57:35] <DevJohnC> depends on the space you're working with
[20:57:47] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, a bit of overlap actually
[20:58:20] <DevJohnC> if you're writing a 2D game, your vectors will have 2 dimensions (ie, Vector2 iirc)
[20:58:30] <DevJohnC> if you're writing a 3D game, your vectors have 3 dimensions
[20:58:55] <DevJohnC> if you're comparing document relevancy your vectors have n dimensions where n is the number of distinct terms you're using for comparison
[20:59:07] <MatthiasVance> Ohh I thought vector always implied direction
[20:59:20] *** Joins: duds- (~duds-@user/duds)
[20:59:21] <MatthiasVance> And that tuple was used for a 2-component thing (like position)
[20:59:25] <MatthiasVance> In math
[20:59:34] <DevJohnC> vectors do imply direction, in the given dimensions
[20:59:57] <DevJohnC> if you draw a line chart with 2 axis, each line is a vector
[21:00:18] <Xenoprimate> vector math can be interpreted geometrically or purely algebraic-ly
[21:00:20] <MatthiasVance> Yes but a line has start + end, which are 4 components
[21:00:30] <MatthiasVance> In a two dimensional chart
[21:00:40] <DevJohnC> well yes, a vector is distinct from it's origin
[21:00:49] <DevJohnC> it doesn't have an endpoint, it has a magnitude (ie, how long the line is)

[23:18:29] <MatthiasVance> The answer it: It depends on your requirements
[23:18:32] <MatthiasVance> *is
[23:19:06] <Ownix> MatthiasVance: Thats what im trying to code for. So far, I know one customer will for sure use Google because they use Google for Work. I want to support another customer which will maybe only require local accounts. And maybe another has their own custom IdP, maybe SAML, maybe ADFS.
[23:19:33] <Ownix> How can I prepare for all of these scenarios? I first decided to use an Auth0 tenant per customer. But it looks like that could get expensive.
[23:19:36] <bomb> USSR is reestablished
[23:19:40] <ki9a> oh that's different
[23:19:44] <ki9a> you can just oauth2
[23:19:50] <ki9a> and allow them to configure it themselves
[23:20:02] <Ownix> ki9a: Azure supports 20 BC2 tenants per AAD tenant I think.
[23:20:16] <Ownix> ki9a: Well, I can do that as an external identity provider in B2C.
[23:20:34] <ki9a> your app could do per customer oauth2
[23:20:52] <Ownix> ki9a: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/5s42ZmBi/image.png
[23:21:01] <ki9a> I know
[23:21:15] <Ownix> ki9a: Well, both have pros and cons right?
[23:21:20] <ki9a> but it ties it to *your* tenant
[23:21:29] <Ownix> If i funnel everyone through B2C I have a single authoritative user store
[23:21:34] <ki9a> also you implicitly trust the external oauth2 provider
[23:21:58] <Ownix> what do you mean implicitly trust?
[23:22:56] <MatthiasVance> Ownix: You still haven't made your use case explicit though

[23:25:01] <Ownix> Lets take the customer with Google Workspace accounts for example, what if I wanted anyone in their workspace to be able to login to mysite.com/customera/dashboard?
[23:25:27] <MatthiasVance> Do you have customers yet?
[23:26:05] <Ownix> MatthiasVance: The google one seems promising and wants a demo, so I figured id get the foundation done for the auth.
[23:26:22] <Ownix> MatthiasVance: Another one we pitched the idea too, and they were very excited
[23:26:23] <MatthiasVance> Ahh sorry didn't get that
[23:26:42] <MatthiasVance> Ownix: That's great! Is this a job thing or something you worked on yourself?

[23:27:36] <MatthiasVance> Ownix: Congrats!
[23:27:53] <ki9a> So most companies have some kind of ids setup already
[23:27:56] <Ownix> No congrats yet please, currently paralyzed by analysis lol
[23:27:58] <ki9a> usually AD or google
[23:28:09] <MatthiasVance> Ownix: Get a big "GET SHIT DONE" sticker on your door
[23:28:36] <Ownix> right ki9a, some companies have their own IdP already. Some have none, some will be cool with local accounts (username and password), some have Google for work, some have AAD, some have ADFS.
[23:28:37] <ki9a> both support oauth2
[23:29:13] <ki9a> Ownix: You could do a single B2C (for those that do NOT have any id provider) and oauth2 for the rest
[23:29:18] <ki9a> (b2c implements oauth2)
[23:29:22] <Ownix> ki9a: Right, and I realize in my app I could slap `services.AddAuthentication().AddGoogle(...)` and boom im done. I could register 2 of those in a row with different schemes. I know thats possible, I could do raw AddOpenIdConnect per scheme. I get all that
[23:31:03] <MatthiasVance> So, F# + Bolero (Blazor) + Elmish is super cool
[23:31:07] <MatthiasVance> But niche?
[23:31:11] <MatthiasVance> I hate it
[23:32:55] <MatthiasVance> I mean I love it, but it's niche so I hate that I love it
[23:33:09] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : You are talking about the lack of Blazor jobs?
[23:33:09] <ki9a> Ownix: I don't think the addgoogle/microsoft etc will suffice for any multi tenant work
[23:33:21] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: No
[23:33:34] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : The, would explain further what you mean about niche?
[23:33:37] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: I am saying that the tech stack of "F# + Bolero + Elmish" is a niche
[23:33:48] <MatthiasVance> That is, not many people will known that / be familiar with it
[23:33:56] *** Joins: DoofusCanadensis (~DoofusCan@2604:3d09:47c:f970:cc99:de34:ef75:dd5b)
[23:34:01] <Ownix> ki9a: Right, for the record, im using this https://www.finbuckle.com/MultiTenant/Docs/v6.6.1/Authentication
[23:34:07] <MatthiasVance> And I think that is bad for a business perhaps :P
[23:34:18] <MatthiasVance> To have a tech stack you can't find devs for
[23:34:24] <MatthiasVance> No matter the awesomeness of it
[23:34:33] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : So, it's not Blazor per-se, but the actual tech stack of "F# + Bolero + Elmish" ?
[23:34:40] <MatthiasVance> yes
[23:34:59] <Ownix> It supports dynamic OIDC providers. But once again, this forces me to make my own users table to keep track of users for email notifications, and authorization (Auth0 Authz seems to kinda suck and cost money)
[23:35:13] <bpmedley> Always fun learning something niche, though.  When I do that it feels like it gives me an edge..
[23:35:23] <Ownix> But dynamic ODIC stuff does not seem to work with B2C, you have to use the Microsoft libraries
[23:35:36] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: Oh definitely as a software engineer, however as a business I might have to make other decisions.. :P
[23:35:58] <MatthiasVance> Anyway I can pick something that will speed me up and replace it later
[23:40:48] <bomb> Should I learn German or Russian?
[23:40:59] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : I'm confused about what you mean by niche.  Are you saying that for your current personal projects the tech stack is useful, yet does work like you want?  Or, that there are fewer people than you like using it so you could talk about it or something else?
[23:41:26] <ki9a> Ownix: you could also just start simple
[23:41:49] <ki9a> Ownix: first do only 1 auth provider (solve the authorization on a higher level)
[23:41:55] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: I really like to use that tech stack myself, I am fairly sure it would speed me up / improve quality a lot. But if I am going to hire people for this, it would be difficult.
[23:42:16] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Gerussian.
[23:42:35] <bpmedley> So, you're talking about hiring people and not working with the tech stack yourself, per-se?
[23:43:03] <MatthiasVance> Yes, about making a decision based on the fact that you most likely have to hire people for it
[23:43:14] <bomb> Gerussian
[23:43:23] <bomb> that sounds horrifying
[23:43:25] <MatthiasVance> While also working with it yourself for the first period :)
[23:43:36] <MatthiasVance> (and probably forever? xD)
[23:43:47] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Better than Russierman
[23:43:49] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : Very unfortunate that you have something you really want, yet can't use effectively.  What do you think you will do?
[23:45:19] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: With the other things in software engineering, I won't prematurely optimize for this. I am not a "frontend engineer" so whatever helps me set up this project fast is a blessing. As long as I make sure it's not coupled it can be "easily" replaced if needed I think :)
[23:45:32] <MatthiasVance> I think I'd rather deal with the JS ecosystem.. later xD
[23:46:28] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : So, for any future hiring decisions, for the frontend, what tech stack do you think you would use?
[23:46:42] <MatthiasVance> Probably React
[23:47:00] <ki9a> Vue!
[23:47:02] <MatthiasVance> WebAssembly frameworks will be a niche for some time
[23:47:02] <ki9a> Svelte!
[23:47:16] <ki9a> Apple doesn't look like it's planning on properly supporting wasm
[23:47:28] <ki9a> only "wasm 1.0"
[23:47:40] <MatthiasVance> And things like that
[23:47:42] <MatthiasVance> It's a shame yeah
[23:48:03] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Why Vue, why Svelte?
[23:48:17] <ki9a> I actually like Svelte
[23:48:27] <ki9a> but Vue over react too.
[23:48:38] <bpmedley> ki9a : Do you use Vue much?
[23:48:40] <ki9a> svelte has a lot less magic
[23:48:43] <ki9a> bpmedley: yes.
[23:48:47] <bomb> what was that lightweight one, Svelte?
[23:48:53] <MatthiasVance> Ah Svelte looks cool yeah
[23:48:53] <bpmedley> What widget set do you use?
[23:49:05] <MatthiasVance> I totally forgot I could also use F# and output React
[23:49:17] <ki9a> svelte is lightweight yes
[23:49:19] <MatthiasVance> But that's still the same deficit
[23:49:20] <bpmedley> ki9a : Sorry, should have used your nick.  What widget set do you use?
[23:49:20] <ki9a> bpmedley: tailwindui
[23:49:22] <ki9a> bith both
[23:49:23] <bpmedley> Thanks!
[23:49:29] <ki9a> tailwind really
[23:49:33] <ki9a> I use tailwindui for reference
[23:52:14] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Do you have a source for the apple wasm 1.0 thing?
[23:52:32] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: Just lack of
[23:52:54] <ki9a> all browsers have since implemented the new proposals
[23:53:02] <ki9a> there's zero info on if/when iOS will support them
[23:53:29] <MatthiasVance> What about Mac though?
[23:53:31] <MatthiasVance> *macOS
[23:53:46] <bpmedley> ki9a : What does lack of properly supporting wasm mean?  Are you talking about fully implementing wasm 1.0 or a future wasm version?
[23:54:29] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Also https://caniuse.com/wasm?
[23:54:36] <MatthiasVance> Yeah what are you refering to :D
[23:54:51] <ki9a> wasm 1.0 is pretty much poc
[23:54:55] <ki9a> it's "oke"
[23:54:59] <ki9a> but exceptions, interfaces etc
[23:55:05] <ki9a> are things you need to make it a serious thing
[23:55:49] <bpmedley> ki9a : So what you are saying is that even if the current wasm 1.0 spec was fully implemented it would not be ready for serious apps?
[23:56:36] <bpmedley> By ready, I mean, that a serious app could not be realized with wasm 1.0..
[23:58:04] <ki9a> can you in theory? yes
[23:58:10] <ki9a> Is it practical? no
[23:58:33] <ki9a> there's a fair amount of overhead without both proposals (they're called proposals, but ff, chrome, edge already support them)
[23:58:53] <ki9a> every outside call from wasm to dom else requires going through js first
[23:59:18] <MatthiasVance> I don't like the alternative though .. JS is messy with numbers :P
[23:59:34] <ki9a> right
