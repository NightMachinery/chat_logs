[04:03:50] <flatcap> dcpurton: I've found a bug (not in your code), that's lead me to a nice simplification I think we can make
[04:04:29] <flatcap> this shows some attachments (recv) before and after collapsing a group
[04:04:31] <flatcap> https://gist.github.com/flatcap/fb6a0d1876b44e901de71870383a3dbf
[04:05:31] <flatcap> notice that when the group is collapsed, the attachments are renamed, so there's no evidence they exist!
[04:09:54] <flatcap> hmm... I was going to suggest we could kill AttachCtx->v2r, but now I'm not so sure

[16:22:27] * flatcap builds ...
[16:22:40] <dcpurton> since Neomutt is really geared towards plain text email, it's not unreasonable for the end user to take some responsibility for creating a sensible email. They just need the building blocks to be able to do whatever they want
[16:24:30] <flatcap> yeah
[16:24:32] <dcpurton> If you want to compose HTML emails with inline attachments aby default, Neomutt probably isn't for you
[16:26:12] <flatcap> :-)
[16:29:45] <dcpurton> I would think the most common use case would be dropping a corporate logo in a signature of an html part. This could be scripted very easily and you'd never need to think about it once set up.

[16:38:07] <flatcap> dcpurton: the docs read ok. I think when it's settled we could do with an big example walkthrough
[16:39:38] <flatcap> (and put it in the Features section: https://neomutt.org/feature)
[16:40:11] <dcpurton> Yeah, I wondered how much detail to put in. Is there a kind of wiki or how to section?
[16:40:24] <flatcap> With a warning: "If you are scared by HTML, please close your window now"
[16:40:43] <dcpurton> I could write a big long article detailing my set up, why I do what i do and explaining how it works
[16:40:52] <flatcap> we have a wiki, but it never got used.  the feature sections can be as large as you like
[16:41:06] <dcpurton> including the pandoc set up, the scripts, macros, etc.
[16:41:28] <dcpurton> My set up is tweaked to behave just like I want it though
[16:43:01] <dcpurton> I see the feature section. This would be a good option
[16:43:39] <dcpurton> I guess the feature really is "Advanced email composition in MarkDown"
[16:44:04] <flatcap> yeah
[16:44:50] <flatcap> it doesn't need to be exhaustive, just enough to get people started and show them what's possible
[16:45:03] <dcpurton> I reckon I could do something
[16:45:35] <flatcap> great.  there's no rush
