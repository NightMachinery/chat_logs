[00:00:33] <jokoon> I have some other unknown software that rejects those MP4 except Im failing to understand why. So I have 50 files that are ok, and about 15 that are not... I'm just trying to see why those 15 files fail
[00:00:43] <JEEB> right
[00:00:51] <JEEB> then something like boxdumper might be able to help
[00:01:02] <JEEB> since it can dump the structure of the file as text
[00:01:46] <jokoon> any binary for this?
[00:02:02] <another|> did you check brand/version like I told you?
[00:02:16] <jokoon> I don't know how to check this
[00:02:24] <another|> ffprobe
[00:02:27] <JEEB> no idea about pre-built binaries. l-smash which includes boxdumper is quite simple to build, though
[00:02:30] <jokoon> I've output all the things ffprobe shows
[00:02:35] <jokoon> and compared each column
[00:03:04] <jokoon> so far those video have Bento4 video handler
[00:03:17] <jokoon> and it's not a discriminant
[00:03:32] <JEEB> handler is something different
[00:04:03] <JEEB> brand and compatible brands is what are the primary container identifiers in MP4
[00:04:39] <JEEB> like if I do `ffprobe -v verbose -i something.mp4`
[00:04:47] <JEEB> I would see major_brand and compatible_brands
[00:04:50] <another|> apple e.g. is especially picky about it
[00:05:18] <another|> shouldn't need verbose
[00:05:56] <jokoon> https://i.imgur.com/psR45e7.jpg
[00:06:08] <jokoon> green is good, red is bad
[00:06:35] <jokoon> although all bad are bento4, there are several bento4 which are good
[00:06:53] <another|> this doesn't list brands
[00:09:26] <jokoon>    major_brand     : isom
[00:09:26] <jokoon>     minor_version   : 512
[00:11:20] <jokoon>     args = ["-show_format", '-v', 'verbose', "-print_format", "json", "-i", path]
[00:12:09] <JEEB> yea in the json they're under tags
[00:12:13] <JEEB> major brand and compatible brands
[00:12:15] <jokoon> oh
[00:12:55] <JEEB> format -> tags I mean
[00:13:03] <JEEB> (since they're not stream-specific)
[00:13:24] <jokoon> 'tags': {'handler_name': 'Bento4 Video Handler', 'language': 'und'},
[00:13:29] <jokoon> nothing about brand
[00:14:47] <jokoon> hum
[00:17:45] <another|> it is right there under format -> tags
[00:19:54] <JEEB> if it's not then it's likely it's not mp4 at all?

[00:20:17] <JEEB> http://up-cat.net/p/52dd34a4
[00:20:24] <JEEB> this is what you more or less should be receiving with an mp4 file
[00:20:48] <JEEB> format_name should contain "mp4" if comma-separated into a list
[00:21:08] <JEEB> and then the brands under tags
[00:21:27] <jokoon> I admit I might have trimmed some json entries but I'm not really sure...
[00:22:06] <JEEB> and if the format_name does not have mp4 in there
[00:22:08] <JEEB> it's not mp4
[00:22:11] <JEEB> (or mp4-like)
[00:22:18] <JEEB> since the same reader is utilized for the same family of formats
[00:22:24] <JEEB> mov, mp4, 3gpp file format etc
[00:22:25] <jokoon> mp4 the container
[00:22:38] <JEEB> yes, mp4 originates from QTFF aka mov
[00:22:41] <JEEB> thus the same reader
[00:22:50] <JEEB> and 3GPP also is a fork of 3GPP
[00:22:52] <JEEB> asdf
[00:22:54] <JEEB> fork of MP4 I mean
[00:23:29] <another|> JEEB: Ah, so that's what happens when someone says "fork yourself"
[00:24:03] <JEEB> what I'm saying is that check that the file is actually mp4-like by checking the format_name (it's a comma-separated list, although usually singular). and then for mp4 under format you should have the brands in tags
[00:24:40] <another|> side note filename extensions mean nothing
[00:25:02] <jokoon> but MP4 can be contained with h264, right?
[00:25:14] <another|> no
[00:25:27] <another|> h264 can be contained in mp4
[00:25:58] <jokoon> yes that's what my poor english brain tried to say

[00:30:50] <JEEB> movie fragments are different to classic mp4 yes
[00:31:12] <jokoon> and ffprobe doesn't report on them?
[00:31:17] <JEEB> mostly utilized in streaming where parts of media are written with a separate index etc

[00:33:55] <JEEB> I would first just compare one that doesn't work and one that works
[00:34:01] <jokoon> I'll do this in python and then see if outputs has 'fragment' in its string
[00:34:01] <JEEB> to see if it's something obvious
[00:34:07] <JEEB> alright
[00:34:26] <JEEB> but yea, fragmented mp4 is 100% legit, it's just often not supported by older parsers
[00:34:32] <jokoon> but json helps me compare field by field if maybe it's not fragment

[00:35:32] <jokoon> in this case, I'm posting video I find on reddit on my whatsapp status, and whatsapp status refuses it, maybe they reencode it or their video toolchain is old indeed

[00:36:39] <jokoon> Testing the limits of file formats :x
[00:37:16] <JEEB> well yea, if it's just the initialization segments plus fragments being stuck together then it's probably fragmented, as movie fragments are heavily utilized in HLS and DASH
[00:37:31] <JEEB> you should be able to just remux it with ffmpeg.c and get rid of movie fragments, though
[00:37:49] <JEEB> since FFmpeg's mp4 writer just writes a new mp4 from scratch
[00:37:59] <JEEB> without fragments unless you enable that feature
[00:38:09] <jokoon> Sure but I would need to just reencode the ones with fragments, not all of them, so I need to detect which one are fragments
[00:38:27] <JEEB> no need to re-encode if it's not the video or audio stream
[00:38:29] <JEEB> just remux
[00:38:55] <JEEB> `ffmpeg -v verbose -i input.mp4 -map 0 -c copy out.mp4`

[13:40:27] <mstein> Is it a known bug that ffmpeg calculates a wrong duration on some mp3 and aac streams with icecast (2.4.0-kh15)? (i.e. duration: 55:52:07.61)

[13:41:56] <JEEB> mstein: nope. I wonder if the additional duration field in whatever it was metadata field throws lavf off
[13:42:17] <helloff> How can I install ffmpeg 7:4.4-1 on Debian?
[13:42:20] <JEEB> generally lavf only makes educated guesses with mp3 since it's not a container and just a raw bit stream
[13:42:40] <JEEB> helloff: if you just need the ffmpeg.c binary check out BtbN's FFmpeg builds on github
[13:42:44] <JEEB> he has linux builds now, too
[13:42:57] <JEEB> he has 4.4 branch builds which include all the fixes included after 4.4 release
[13:43:08] <JEEB> (since tehre has been no 4.4.1 release yet)
[13:44:04] <helloff> Ok. So, I’ve got ffmpeg version 3.2.15-0+deb9u3 on my server. Is there a “fast” way to upgrade this using sudo apt…?
[13:44:19] <mstein> JEEB: how could I investigate further? Already tried to fetch two different streams one where it works and one where it doesn't work and did a binary compare...
[13:44:20] <helloff> to 4.x
[13:45:01] <JEEB> mstein: looking at their beginning in a hex editor or so? unless there is a better analysis tool for raw mpeg-1 layer 3 (mp3)
[13:46:05] <mstein> JEEB: yes, tried with a hex editor but start is a bit different so comparision is not so easy... but starting at a certain point it was the same data..
[13:46:18] <helloff> Any way to utilize apt-get to install a specific version?
[13:47:10] <mstein> JEEB: already tried nightly build of ffplay, problem still exists...so looks like being actual. Log shows: [aac @ 000001b808f7e640] Estimating duration from bitrate, this may be inaccurate
[13:47:12] <JEEB> helloff: if someone provides it? personally i wouldn't start playing with trying to change distro packages and would just utilize a static build built by myself (or if I trust someone enough, someone's build)
[13:47:30] <JEEB> in general BtbN is part of the community and the builds are automated, so I feel relatively comfortable to point people to htem
[13:47:36] <JEEB> extract and use it with full path
[13:47:44] <JEEB> instead of putting it into some distro location
[13:50:47] <helloff> Static builds are downloadable executables?
[13:51:49] <JEEB> yes
[13:52:06] <JEEB> just extract tarball, /full/path/to/extracted/place/bin/ffmpeg
[13:52:18] <JEEB> https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/
[13:52:26] <JEEB> if you look at the latest release it should have linux as well
[13:52:37] <JEEB> it has master and 4.4 release branch
[13:54:26] <mstein> JEEB: what would be best? Shall I create a bug report with examples?
[13:55:13] *** Quits: rpthms (~rpthms@user/rpthms) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:55:17] <JEEB> you can do that, trac.ffmpeg.org is for that. but of course duration for raw mp3 will never be perfect
[13:55:25] <JEEB> since mp3 is not an indexed container
[13:55:45] <mstein> I would be very happy if there is no duration...
[13:57:24] <mstein> Because to describe the problem further... I found the problem on Google Nest Hub - the audio player shows me a duration on that stream, but should not. Then found the same problem on google chrome, then found that both seem to use ffmpeg and could it reproduce with ffplay
[13:58:38] *** Quits: plitter (~plitter@user/plitter) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[14:00:45] <JEEB> most real audio players just index mp3 files, which you can do with the API. also I wonder if icecast or whatever is pushing out an index that says it has a duration like that, and lavf just exposes it :)
[14:01:44] <JEEB> but yea without seeing samples it's pretty hard to say anything :)
[14:02:13] <mstein> winamp or aimp correctly does not show a duration ... I'll go get examples...

[18:56:50] <KingArron> does FFMpeg support Dolby Vision now?
[18:57:29] <JEEB> DoVi means a lot of things due to how Dolby uses the same (marketing) name for a bunch of stuff
[18:57:45] <JEEB> so you might want to be more specific which is the DoVi you're talking about :)
[18:58:21] <KingArron> sorry, DV HDR playback including Kodi/MrMc support
[18:58:50] <JEEB> same thing again, since that includes most of the things D uses the DoVi moniker for, which are different
[18:59:03] <JEEB> I'm sorry for possibly being rude, but unfortunately D uses the naming for a lot of stuff

[18:59:56] <JEEB> if you have an example file you're interested in, pastebin onto a pastebin site of your choice the result of `ffprobe -of json -show_format -show_streams -i input.file`

[19:01:40] <jokoon> I'm going to give up this whatsapp thing
[19:01:51] <JEEB> KingArron: ok, that's something different but thankfully does contain the info
[19:01:57] <JEEB> so this is DoVi Profile 5
[19:02:13] <jokoon> seems like it's a whatsapp video bug or something else
[19:02:14] <JEEB> which is together with DoVi Profile 7 something custom
[19:02:35] <jokoon> I'll just test all video and reencode the offenders
[19:02:58] <JEEB> there are attempts at making it playable but it requires the RPU stuff that it mentions (BL is just "base layer", Profile 7 has "extension layer" which you have to merge into it)
[19:04:26] <KingArron> I use Mr/Mc on my iphone 12 pro max which supports Profile 7 and so far only infuse app could play a certain DV file and Kodi other apps were green and purple which use ffmpeg
[19:05:11] <JEEB> KingArron: so basically you can read the data from the file and if you have a hardware decoder that supports this proprietary crap it should work even now. for proper open source playback some additional developments are required since the RPU data needs to be exposed. I made some initial code for it, but now someone else was poking at bringing it forwards. after that players that implement the DoVi Profile
[19:05:17] <JEEB> 5/7 proprietary IPT/ITP color space
[19:06:37] <JEEB> https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libplacebo/-/issues/113 and https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/7326 are related
[19:06:50] <KingArron> https://community.firecore.com/t/dolby-vision-profile-5-in-mkv/28500/8
[19:06:51] <JEEB> for open source implementations of the DoVi Profile 5/7 stuff
[19:07:26] <JEEB> but 7 is anyways a separate mess since you need to merge BL and EL
[19:08:10] <KingArron> yeah i'm asking the MrMc app team if they support DV on iOS and HDR10+ works flawless
[19:08:32] <JEEB> on hardware devices if you have a hw decoder that handles it for you then of course you don't care
[19:08:44] <JEEB> since you just pass it the read HEVC stream
[19:09:04] <JEEB> so for that use case where you have some proprietary hw API that handles it for you, that should already work
[19:09:46] <JEEB> for something like ffmpeg.c or mpv or libplacebo or vlc to convert it to something that is shown on your screen still development is needed
[19:11:19] <JEEB> but at least for the RPU metadata stuff someone was interesting in picking up my work :)
[19:13:12] <KingArron> this file worked in MrMc but not sure if its just DV or with HDR10 fall back https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwxFVkl63-lEc3k0aldZaGtaVm8/view?resourcekey=0-ECypkFcgdKx1YiojpUCWBA
[19:13:32] <KingArron> LG demo
[19:15:04] <JEEB> I think I have that one and the one I have is just normal BT.709/BT.1886 SDR
[19:15:27] <JEEB> you could have just checked with whatever tool you have since you got the info for that one file anyways :P
[19:16:01] <JEEB> HDR generally is with transfer function PQ (ST 2084) or HLG (ARIB STD-B67)
[19:16:26] <JEEB> DoVi Profile 5/7 specifies no such information, and it just has the profile mentioned in the stream metadata
[19:20:12] <KingArron> is HDR10+ more used now than DV?

[20:23:31] <JEEB> KingArron: most utilized is PQ transfer + BT.2020 primaries/matrix on UHD BD and video-on-demand
[20:23:45] <JEEB> on live it's mostly HLG transfer + BT.2020 primaries/matrix for HDR
[20:24:18] <JEEB> and funny enough D did make DoVi profiles that are exactly those two :P
[20:24:41] <JEEB> for example the "DoVi" that iPhone 12 Pro makes is Profile 8, which is HLG
[20:25:01] <JEEB> it just has D's "yes this is totally DoVi" thing in there in the container
