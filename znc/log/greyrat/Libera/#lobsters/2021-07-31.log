[03:21:41] <meff[m]> ignaloidas: yeah masks are expensive because there hasn't been much need for non-Intel-AMD to make cheap masks, so there's never been an investment in appropriate tooling
[03:21:42] <c355e3b> Their fries are OK

[03:28:58] <c355e3b> but its a bit of a mess

[03:35:42] <ignaloidas> meff[m], at 130nm most manufacturing is by smaller companies doing microcontrollers and similar low power stuff, I'd imagine there's a fair bit of demand there
[03:36:02] <meff[m]> Yeah at 130nm it gets better for sure
[03:36:18] <meff[m]> the sizes are also large enough that older tools work well, so it'll be cheaper just from that perspective
[03:36:23] <ignaloidas> it's still 100k$ looking at the chart I posted earlier
[03:36:39] <meff[m]> just gotta sell 10k units for $10 ðŸ˜›
[03:37:07] <ignaloidas> and then you got your investment on masks back, time to get money on silicon :)
[03:38:20] <ignaloidas> doing it maskless would be a way, but I don't think any "real" fabs are set up that way
[03:38:30] <ignaloidas> from all I saw it was all academia
[03:41:19] <ignaloidas> another possibility could be batching several designs together just like PCB houses do, but that's gonna be a lot harder with silicon

[14:48:31] <albertito> epilys: fwiw I get random forks on my not-popular-at-all projects too
[14:48:46] <riv> i dont know if anyone forks anything i have
[14:49:20] <lep> many of my repos are actually releveant for some chinese so i think i get more likes than forks

[14:51:23] <epilys> albertito, I guess it's an alternative to bookmarks then
[14:52:15] <albertito> epilys: that was my leading theory but I honestly don't know either. It could be like you said people trying to inflate some metric that someone cares about for some reason? it's weird

[16:38:17] <Ristovski> seems like links have no padding
[16:38:41] <epilys> Ristovski, are you using an ancient browser perhaps?
[16:38:58] <Ristovski> epilys: nope, Chromium (albeit maybe 1 year old)
[16:39:31] <epilys> version?
[16:40:12] <Ristovski> epilys: Chromium 81
[16:41:31] *** Joins: thelazyoxymoron (~thelazyox@49.207.192.176)
[16:45:05] <epilys> ok apparently the css property `column-gap` was only implemented in 84+
[16:45:17] <epilys> 2 years after firefox
[16:50:38] <epilys> Ristovski, you should update if you are able to
[16:50:47] <Ristovski> Oh hmm, interesting
[16:50:58] <Ristovski> epilys: I mainly keep it because I cba to rebase my patches on top of latest chromium
[16:51:30] <epilys> you can keep the old binary and use the latest one for browsing
[16:51:51] <epilys> you're missing a lot of new CSS stuff that's very cool with an old version
[16:53:44] <msmith12[m]> I only update chromium when i feel like it
[16:54:00] <msmith12[m]> I hate the autoupdate thing i turned it off
[16:54:43] <Ristovski> I mainly hate how Google removes seemingly nice feature that they A/B
[16:54:53] <epilys> i wouldn't know, I use Firefox :D
[16:55:36] <Ristovski> I am very close to switching to Firefox, but WebGL/video performance is still weird on Linux. I fixed WebGL performance by enabling xrender which then causes videos to stutter (while they render at 60fps, so its some weird rendering issue)
[16:56:01] <Ristovski> or was it that I tracked it to be something to do with audio, I can't remember
[16:56:27] <msmith12[m]> Servo is like the new Cairo
[16:57:37] <epilys> Ristovski, check if your problem is solved in nightly?
[16:57:43] <Ristovski> epilys: I already use nightly :/
[16:57:49] <epilys> hmm
[16:58:09] <epilys> it'd help to file a bug
[16:58:09] <Ristovski> and I am usually /very/ good at debugging rendering crap
[16:58:30] <Ristovski> Yeah I should once I get enough time to get my hands dirty and do some debugging instead of just filing "Video choppy, pls fix :("
[16:59:17] <epilys> for what it's worth if you have the bug report text ready it's very quick to submit it
[16:59:38] <epilys> doesn't even require an account iirc
[17:00:13] <Ristovski> They use bugzilla, right?
[17:00:24] <epilys> you can login via github if you don't have a mozilla account already, my bad
[17:00:24] <Ristovski> yeah pretty straightforward then
