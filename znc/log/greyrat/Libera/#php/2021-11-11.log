[00:03:46] <lembron> while not directly php... any words on: adding x-frame-options to a legacy project - are there any "soft" options to trail run it with reporting? - like email-dmarc stuff can do or so? - maybe abusing a framekiller for a bit?

[00:21:51] <biberu> lembron: did you look into csp? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP
[00:22:32] <biberu> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors
[00:22:51] <biberu> ctrl-f reporting on the first page
[00:24:52] <lembron> CSP is like the "new" version of this header hm? Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only seems like what im looking for
[00:25:29] <biberu> it's much more than that header
[00:26:21] <biberu> here's a list of directives: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy
[00:27:23] <lembron> is using just CSP "fine" today, or still both? - currently there is "Nothing", blocking frames is a first it needs implemented 'now' but likely ome more will follow in the future

[00:28:09] <biberu> check the browser support, depends on your situation
[00:29:21] <lembron> guess thats more a "what do people out there actually do?"
[00:29:55] <lembron> either how, ill play around with this a bit, thank you very much, i had looked at csp before but must have missed the reporting-only thing
[00:31:21] <biberu> I'm using csp, but might combine it with e.g. x-frame-options depending on the use case and the audience
[00:34:23] <lembron> ye and i guess once csp-report-only figured it out, switching live csp and duplicating that to x-frame isnt much of a deal
[00:35:09] <lembron> now onto see if there i anything to consume/map csp reports :D

[04:03:13] <CoJaBo> No apparent mention of it in there, ugh
[04:03:35] <__adrian> https://php.net/extension_loaded
[04:04:03] <CoJaBo> No php.ini file either. That seems like a problem
[04:04:09] <__adrian> not really
[04:04:35] <__adrian> they all have defaults. though might not be what you want
[04:05:51] <__adrian> is there a reason you're wanting to jump directly to 8.1? why not 8.0?
[04:07:54] <CoJaBo> They're wanting to deploy it on the latest version, and apparently assuming 8.1 will be that version when they deploy
[04:08:17] <CoJaBo> I did another install, and it seems to have fixed that, as I just got my first syntax/parse error lol
[04:08:19] <__adrian> "latest version" *needs* to be latest at time of work
[04:08:42] <__adrian> it's foolish to target a version that isn't yet released
[04:08:56] <CoJaBo> We do lots of foolish things here
[04:09:08] * __adrian shrugs
[04:09:10] <__adrian> enjoy, then
[04:09:20] <CoJaBo> 8.1RC seems a bit more likely to be closer to 8.1 final than 8.0 will be
[04:09:35] <__adrian> sure
[04:09:39] <CoJaBo> I completely expect a "Hey, this doesn't work!" in a few months, but we'd get that either way lol
[04:09:40] <__adrian> it's also more likely to have bugs
[04:10:30] <CoJaBo> > Optional parameter  declared before required parameter  is implicitly treated as a required parameter
[04:10:41] <CoJaBo> Sadly, I wrote that function :/
[04:10:43] <__adrian> though it's debatable whether "closer but broken" is _really_ "closer" than "working"
[04:12:58] <CoJaBo> Yeh, but it's not like I don't run into PHP bugs in released versions either.. =D
[04:13:50] <CoJaBo> We're (I would certainly hope) not going to run this in prod, so if it bugs it bugs.

[15:56:30] <rdbeni0> $this->csv_handle = fopen($this->csv_input_file, "r");
[15:56:46] <Blondie101010> that line will work
[15:56:51] <rdbeni0> and csv file contains a lot of utf-8 characters
[15:57:20] <Blondie101010> then show the line that reads multi bytes characters!

[15:58:58] <rdbeni0> so in my understand, i will have normal utf-8 character in the array? i need to use that array later to send SOAP request
[15:59:13] <Blondie101010> show the problem
[15:59:53] <rdbeni0> currently no problem, i would like just to confirm that utf-8 is working out of the box in the situation like that :D but i will check it anyway
[16:00:19] <Blondie101010> hmmmmm
[16:01:06] <Blondie101010> multibyte characters cause parsing problems when using functions who are plainly treating them as a series of bytes
[16:01:51] <Blondie101010> it's not a matter of PHP being able to read them or not, but YOUR code being done properly to handle it
[16:02:56] <Blondie101010> rdbeni0:  that said, why don't you use !+fgetcsv
[16:02:56] <php-bot> rdbeni0:  that said, why don't you use, array fgetcsv(resource fp [,int length [, string delimiter [, string enclosure[, string escape]]]])  - Get line from file pointer and parse for CSV fields - http://php.net/fgetcsv
[16:08:20] <rdbeni0> i am trying to understand you , what do you mean "multibyte characters cause parsing problems when using functions who are plainly treating them as a series of bytes" ? because currently it seems that i have correct characters in the array
[16:08:39] <rdbeni0> but if i will have any special-long utf-8 character, then it will be broken?
[16:10:19] <rdbeni0> other question
[16:10:31] <rdbeni0> it print_r in my terminal is showing utf-8 characters
[16:10:36] <rdbeni0> correct

[16:27:54] <__adrian> rdbeni0: if you already discussed this, my apologies, but i didn't see it
[16:28:42] <__adrian> it might not be clear, but while php has functions that are aware of charsets (and others that aren't), there is NO "charset" for a string. strings are NOT a sequence of characters. they are a sequence of _bytes_.
[16:29:51] <__adrian> e.g., "default_charset = "UTF-8"" doesn't mean php uses utf-8. it means specific functions that uses charsets will use utf-8 if you don't specify otherwise.

[16:33:04] <rdbeni0> Ok, excellent. For now it seems that is working : and in each print/echo i have utf-8 everywhere (no issues). Probably that default_charset = "UTF-8" is doing the job. But in case of any problems i will take a look on mb_* family
[16:35:16] <Blondie101010> rdbeni0:  `echo` merely outputs a sequence of bytes, so if you pass it complete multibyte characters, they will be output correctly
[16:35:53] <Blondie101010> you probably need to get a better understanding of how UTF-8 is made
[16:36:00] <__adrian> ^
[16:36:30] <__adrian> php doesn't unexpected change the bytes in your string, so good in → good out. garbase in → garbage out
[16:37:32] <__adrian> but if you do something like  substr($utf8, 5)  and byte 5 happens to be in the middle of a character, you're going to break it.

[20:54:32] <tomtom-> The reason we keep the php_value in the VirtualHost configuration instead of in a .htaccess is that the .htaccess file is stored in the repository along with the code. The values in the VirtualHost differs a little bit from server to server so that is why we didn't want to have it .htaccess.

[20:55:59] <tomtom-> We can of course use .user.ini and then add it to gitginore, but we are so used to these global values being set in the VirtualHost that for us it feels more natural to have them in pool.d/custom.conf.
[20:56:42] <dag> the best practices is to put this stuff in php-fpm pool config.
[20:56:53] *** Joins: brachamh (~brachamh@user/brachamh)
[20:57:35] <dag> you can do `include = /topkek.conf` inside php-fpm config files
[21:00:38] <tomtom-> Yes, php-fpm.conf already comes with a `include=/etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/*.conf` so it seems to work fine to just add that pool.d/custom.conf
[21:02:23] <tomtom-> But the only issue I had was that when I restarted php7.4-fpm it failed. It works if I add a `[www]` in the custom.conf, but I'm not sure if this is a problem since the www.conf also contains this.
[21:02:34] <tomtom-> Adding the content of custom.conf to www.conf works fine.

[21:07:03] <dag> i havent fiddled too much with these configs. but each file is supposed to contain a pool and each file must start with the pool name in brackets e.g. [topkek]
[21:08:08] <dag> i suggest putting the entire file into some kind of version control. it's also a nice container for setting ENV values
[21:10:07] <tomtom-> I could just keep the overrides in the default www.conf, but what worries me is that a server upgrade or such suddenly overwrites that file.
[21:11:09] <tomtom-> A better idea might be to just create my own conf with a different pool, i.e. myapp.conf with [myapp] and use that one.
[21:11:12] <dag> mv www.conf tomtom.conf
[21:11:40] <dag> also distros ask before overwriting modified config files.
[21:12:00] <tomtom-> It does, but you can make a mistake a click overwrite.
[21:12:25] <tomtom-> Doing mv www.conf tomtom.conf works, but what happens if there shows up a www.conf there after the server upgrade.
[21:12:26] <dag> anyways, you keep backupd right. so it't not a problem :D
[21:13:02] <tomtom-> I'm guessing the config files are read in alphabetic order so www.conf would then override whatever is in tomtom.conf unless I use a different pool name in tomtom.conf.

[21:13:53] <da_wunder> or just use docker for those applications and setup what ever you need on each those docker image
[21:14:41] <tomtom-> Maybe in the future we will dockerize it, but at the moment no.

[21:17:13] <dag> im allergic to unnecessary complexity though
[21:17:42] <tomtom-> Docker has its benefits, but I don't believe that everything can be dockerized as some of my collegues thinks. :P
[21:18:38] <da_wunder> for me docker is really nice, because I have applications that uses php 5.3, 5.6, 7.x and 8.x - so eg. development environment setup for each of those is just to clone application repo and run `make start` command and kaboom everything is ready
[21:18:40] <panosdev> Hello, when you have to insert new rows on tables with relationships in mysql, you add new row on table A with an auto incremented primary key id of 5.  When you are going to add a new row on table B you need to get the primary key of the other table which is 5, how do you do that? One way would be to select the last row of table A but that feels like a bad idea.
[21:19:32] <dag> panosdev: lastinsertid
[21:19:40] <da_wunder> panosdev: one solution is use UUIDs or ULIDs as a ID and not just auto increment
[21:20:06] <AllenJB> panosdev: last insert id - this is a method / function available on both pdo and mysqli as well as being a MySQL function itself (LAST_INSERT_ID())
[21:20:08] <panosdev> how much would UUIDs impact performance though
[21:20:56] <panosdev> is last insert id safe though?
[21:21:37] <dag> da_wunder: so basically what you need is a VM and that is your primary reason for using docker
[21:21:38] <AllenJB> panosdev: Very safe. It's connection specific, so it gets the last id generated by the last query on the current connection.
[21:22:01] <panosdev> hmm I thought about it and I think I'll go with last insert id function of pdo
[21:22:14] <panosdev> thanks for the help! :D
[21:23:19] <AllenJB> You can read full details of how last insert id works in the MySQL manual
[21:24:21] <panosdev> Reading that now, thanks a lot!
[21:27:05] <tomtom-> I was wrong about the alphabetic order it seems. I created a pool.d/a.conf where I set memory_limit to 512M and in pool.d/www.conf I set it 256M. After restarting php-fpm the memory_limit is set to 512M.
[21:27:25] <tomtom-> Both conf files have [www] as the pool name.
[21:30:07] <da_wunder> dag: still I prefer local docker setup versus some shared vm for multiple developers

[22:28:33] <jackal> hello!
[22:29:48] <jackal> how can i duplicate lines in a file, but the duplicate line to be next to the first?
[22:30:34] <jackal> if i use str_repeat with file_get_contents, the dup lines appear at the end of the file
[22:31:19] <AllenJB> naïve method: iterate the original file line-by-line, writing out to a new file until you find the lines you want to duplicate, then write those out a second time before continuing
[22:32:00] <jackal> i want to dup every line
[22:33:07] <AllenJB> Same method applies, just without the conditional then - iterate the original file, writing to a new file, writing every line twice.
[22:33:48] <AllenJB> This method is probably also the most memory efficient, since you never need to store the entire file in memory (in a variable) - just one line at a time.
[22:33:51] <jackal> how would i go about that? pretty amateur to php :)
[22:34:51] <AllenJB> The filesystem functions - specifically fopen, fgets and fwrite
