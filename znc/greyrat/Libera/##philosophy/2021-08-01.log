[00:22:57] <Parf> nah fuck all that shit, i didn't like any of it
[00:23:11] <Parf> it can go fuck itself, it's worse in every way compared to futurama
[00:23:26] <hexeme_> I_Am_M00t: especially the episode where Rick and Summer go to all the planets undergoing apocalypses to have unadulterated interspecies orgies
[00:23:35] <Parf> in fact, futurama is even more of a triumph now because it actually predicts things so accurately that it's hard to tell if it wasn't actually part of the "plan"
[00:23:51] <I_Am_M00t> the story line may be adult, but there's something about it
[00:27:54] <Parf> probably because it's not all singly written any longer
[00:28:57] <zacts> #philosophy #philosophy #philosophy Gosh! :-)
[00:31:51] <Parf> honestly i don't like it because it's not clever enough, sure it's tv worthy, but is that who i am anymore? is that all i want or need? it's all so cheap, i need spiritual fulfillment, not neo-pop nihilism, which is the prevailing theme behind that show
[00:32:16] <I_Am_M00t> lol

[00:33:41] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but try too hard and it becomes dull

[00:36:55] <Parf> really the king's pleasure is in certain novels when it comes to the absurd and where and when to tolerate it, for me, though that sort of abstraction can too become palling. i'm more the heroic narrative type, myself, i get the absurd, i admire it especially when it takes a turn for the grand, something lynchian, or whatever you please, but as to being someone who enjoys a television show, i didn't like tim and eric very much
