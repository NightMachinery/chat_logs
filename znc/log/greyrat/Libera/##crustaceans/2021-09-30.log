[01:05:37] <dimadima> cool
[01:05:41] <gerikson> I was, for once, hung over ;)
[01:05:42] <dimadima> no reason to care
[01:05:47] <dimadima> just mildly amusing
[01:05:54] <dimadima> cause, you know, there's no <pre> or whatever
[01:06:13] <dimadima> ah nice
[01:06:33] <gerikson> yeah I tried to fix that by adding ``` to the content, but I think it just mangled the text decoration
[01:06:45] <manicennui> postman is really fucking annoying now.
[01:06:45] <gerikson> I might try to find a figlet font that's better
[01:06:57] <manicennui> I wouldn't use it at all if it weren't for the fact that everyone else I work with uses it.
[01:07:15] <dimadima> postman milks the enterprise like it's nobody's business
[01:07:15] <gerikson> remind me, what is postman? mailing list software?
[01:07:19] <dimadima> my mom uses postman
[01:07:28] <dimadima> gerikson: send http requests
[01:07:28] <manicennui> gerikson: GUI curl basically.
[01:07:35] <manicennui> It used to be a standalone app.
[01:07:38] <hoistbypetard> if i'm not collaborating with people who share via postman, i prefer insomnia
[01:07:42] <manicennui> But now you have to create an account
[01:07:45] <dimadima> lol what
[01:07:57] <manicennui> And they try to get you to use their site to do everything, but their site can't talk to anything that isn't on the public internet.
[01:08:06] <manicennui> So then you have to install the desktop client anyways.
[01:08:12] <hoistbypetard> (in before "postman causes dimadima's mom insomnia")
[01:08:17] <manicennui> And they seem to spend most of their time making it harder to find the things you need to do.
[01:08:30] <dimadima> hoistbypetard: ah cool had never seen that, thank you
[01:08:54] <dimadima> hoistbypetard: postman stresses her out
[01:09:02] <hoistbypetard> :)
[01:09:23] <dimadima> how did you know seriously
[01:09:41] <manicennui> Can insomnia export to postman collection format?
[01:10:16] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: no idea
[01:10:41] <cb> damn that's a perfect example of gemini being insufferable
[01:10:48] <cb> and devault
[01:11:02] <hoistbypetard> dimadima: i thought you were making a "postman always rings twice" style joke and just went with it
[01:12:59] <dimadima> oh man no that's pretty sweet though. my mom is a classic programmer/analyst who was doing a lot of sql before they started making her do web stuff at work which she doesnt know and doesnt care to know
[01:14:12] <dimadima> she's at that stage in her life when she just wants to chill with her grandchildren and watch HBO and not learn C#
[01:16:13] <dimadima> or HTTP headers
[01:16:59] <gerikson> understandable
[01:17:17] <dimadima> definitely
[01:17:20] <dimadima> i hope she retires soon
[01:17:38] <dimadima> but she'd also probably go crazy having no job
[01:17:38] <manicennui> One doesn't need to be old to be sick of web development.
[01:17:43] <gerikson> this industry could stand to listen to older voices
[01:18:37] <dimadima> i don't think it's that it's web development it's that it's new and she doesn't care
[01:18:58] <dimadima> i truly don't understand ageism in tech. if my app gets anywhere i'm going to go out of my way to hire older ppl
[01:19:19] <dimadima> wanting young devs is like wanting a young doctor
[01:19:24] <dimadima> who wants a young doctor?
[01:19:50] <manicennui> Age is not generally a good metric for doctors one way or the other.
[01:19:52] <dimadima> i want a person who can tell me about DEC/VMS at lunch
[01:20:00] <manicennui> You probably want a doctor associated with a research university.
[01:20:17] <dimadima> it's not but say for a generic internist, i want a person who's seen the most shit
[01:20:23] <manicennui> I use Northwestern doctors, and they seem to generally be more informed about the latest thinking.
[01:20:44] <dimadima> i want the person who will tell me when i don't actually need to get a test or procedure
[01:20:52] <manicennui> Of course it could just be that Northwestern is one of the best medical facilities in the US.
[01:20:58] <dimadima> yeah
[01:21:20] <dimadima> anyway that was possibly a bad analogy
[01:21:24] <manicennui> But even my primary care doctor, who does not work at the hospital itself, doesn't do shit like push drugs on me for every little problem.
[01:21:40] <manicennui> I think there are old developers who are bad too.
[01:21:41] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[01:21:54] <dimadima> lol buttsbot
[01:21:56] <dimadima> butt out
[01:22:08] <manicennui> I've not experienced ageism yet, and we have many older developers.
[01:22:46] <manicennui> I also don't try to get jobs at startups with 60-hour weeks though.
[01:23:38] <dimadima> i suspect if  you get a good older dev, they don't need to work 60 hours
[01:24:10] <edk> nobody needs to work 60 hours imo
[01:24:21] <dimadima> i had to work a ton to learn stuff
[01:24:43] <dimadima> but that could just be because i am sloowwwww
[01:24:52] <edk> i think people who are overworked slow down quite quickly due to the overworking
[01:25:19] <dimadima> well i'm also a hyperfocuser, so there's that too
[01:25:21] <edk> to the point that they're taking 60 hours just to do the equivalent of a normal week of work
[01:34:21] <dimadima> yeah thats probably true for most people most cases
[01:48:31] <indigo> Yes, but how can you virtue signal that you're working so hard without working 60+ hours a week?

[07:39:06] <dimadima> comment-as-first-draft here
[07:39:22] <dimadima> a little embarassing but that's life i guess
[07:40:47] <bontaq> love to see it right as we're planning to switch to kafka-based event sourcing :P
[07:41:09] <dimadima> really?
[07:41:30] <bontaq> yep
[07:41:42] <dimadima> what scale?
[07:41:49] <dimadima> if i may ask
[07:42:07] <dimadima> not just of data but of scope of data
[07:42:29] <dimadima> like just a piece of your company's data or all of it?
[07:42:44] <bontaq> kinda curious how it'll go, I wanna say we're at like 500 programmers?
[07:43:23] <dimadima> post updates if anything interesting happens
[07:43:44] <bontaq> oh I think pieces of data, moving to fully event sourced for orders / carts / charges
[07:44:18] <dimadima> neat. kafka streams is super cool. are you using the schema registry thing?
[07:44:28] <dimadima> i just used protobufs
[07:44:34] <bontaq> because like you we're thinking "this is the way it should be done"
[07:46:19] <dimadima> the problems and questions that arose were basically endless. for example: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/380196/should-i-store-an-event-stream-or-just-state-for-a-frequently-changing-entity
[07:46:19] <buttsbot> domain driven design - Should I store an event stream or just state for a frequently changing entity? - Software Engineering Stack Exchange
[07:46:49] <bontaq> I'm not too sure what'll shake out, rn the infrastructure team is figuring out how to get kafka setup
[07:48:13] <dimadima> buckle up! lol
[07:50:07] <bontaq> yeah it definitely could be a shitshow, I'm pretty curious about how long it'll take to rebuild a "cart" from events that could've happened weeks ago
[07:50:16] <bontaq> and that being a crazy number of events
[07:52:09] <bontaq> but we're into FP so of course it's like, "woah cool!" [destroys company]
[07:52:18] <dimadima> you probably won't be rebuilding much unless you need to build a new projection
[07:52:48] <dimadima> and even then, probably not too long. kafka and rocksdb (or whatever it uses now for storing rebuilt state) is really fast
[07:53:23] <dimadima> i never accumulated enough data to personally test this, but apparently kafka can read/write millions of records per second
[07:53:45] <dimadima> and of course it can scale out
[07:54:08] <bontaq> oh do you store the projection in a more local database?
[07:55:06] <dimadima> yeah, at each data transformation step that needs state, there's a local DB that ideally sits on an SSD. then output data can also be stored like that and even queried directly
[07:55:38] <bontaq> thaaat makes a lot more sense than rereading all events each time lol
[07:56:05] <dimadima> yeah. and it keeps track of how far along it is, so if something happens it doesn't have to start all over
[07:57:13] <dimadima> it's cool. i found it quite enjoyable :)
[07:57:29] <dimadima> unfortunately it was intellectually enjoyable and not, like, what i needed
[07:58:34] <bontaq> yeah I'm looking forward to it for the experience.  I think we're finally big enough / enough teams that it makes sense
[07:58:51] <bontaq> but I could see everyone giving up and just vending APIs for each service
[08:00:52] <dimadima> if you already have a running business with well-devloped models and a large team i think it could actually go quite well
[08:01:46] <dimadima> if it goes south, seeing how it fails will also be really interesting
[08:01:55] <dimadima> presuming it doesn't make your work life go to shit
[08:05:26] <bontaq> it should be fun, I think we're gonna do it over winter?  that's our usual slow-time and infrastructure things time, so that we don't blow up the site during holidays

[17:49:15] <dimadima> morning gwozniak
[17:53:14] <gwozniak> 'morning
[17:53:51] <gwozniak> Just found a bug in the compiler pass I was working for a while. Turns out there was a condition I didn't think would occur that did, in fact, occur
[17:54:12] <gwozniak> Even though it kind of doesn't make sense, but it's not illegal, so.... *shrug*
[17:57:34] <gwozniak> Compiler actually generated a compare instruction that compares a register against itself
[17:57:48] <gwozniak> Didn't consider that, since it's pretty silly
[17:57:51] <gwozniak> But it happened
[17:59:38] <dimadima> how do you test the compiler? some kind of unit testing?
[17:59:48] <dimadima> is this the kind of thing you'd document with a test?
[18:00:07] <companion_cube> i'd put an assert, personally
[18:01:11] <gwozniak> I unit tested some of the code, but most compiler pass tests are integration-style tests because you need to see how they interact with other passes
[18:01:24] <companion_cube> => assert
[18:01:31] <companion_cube> which works well iwth integration tests!
[18:01:39] <gwozniak> companion_cube: what would the assertion be in this case?
[18:02:06] <gwozniak> The condition is valid in this case and should not make the compilation fail. It's just redundant
[18:03:08] <gwozniak> The problem was I didn't take into consideration that a compare might compare a register against itself
[18:03:29] <companion_cube> heh, ok
[18:03:51] <gwozniak> Usually earlier passes get rid of such things, but not in this case (to my surprise!)
[18:04:06] <companion_cube> if I'd expect earlier passes to remove that I'd still assert the registers are distinct
[18:04:18] <companion_cube> but you know, probably not applicable here
[18:04:43] <gwozniak> I can't assert it if its not illegal.  It's just weird.
[18:05:20] <dimadima> gwozniak: wouldn't the test be that the earlier pass got rid of such things?
[18:06:30] <gwozniak> Maybe, but again, it's not illegal
[18:07:01] <gwozniak> And just about any pass could introduce it
[18:09:42] <dimadima> so it's the kind of thing that may not even be considered a bug per se?
[18:09:58] <gwozniak> I should also point out that testing this exhaustively in GCC is quite a pain because you have to manually write RTL to have decent control over the code your pass gets as input, and doing so is rather limited.  Most tests are C code that passes through the whole compiler stages before it gets to your pass
[18:10:35] <gwozniak> dimadima: yes, the comparison instruction is not a bug. The bug is the pass doesn't consider it properly.
[18:11:11] <gwozniak> Writing C code that triggers the condition you want is a chore
[18:11:41] <dimadima> test setups in general can be nightmarish chores it seems
[18:15:54] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[18:15:56] <gwozniak> LLVM has a much nicer testing framework.  Still a bit verbose, but at least allows you to control what inputs your pass can be tested with

[19:05:37] <manicennui> This afternoon I have one 30 minute meeting every hour for three hours.
[19:06:17] <manicennui> Just to make as much of my day unproductive as possible.
[19:17:06] <dimadima> bummer
[19:28:41] <manicennui> I've realized that some of these top anime YouTubers don't really talk about anything in depth. It's a step above straight out memes, but they also use a lot of memes.
[19:29:03] <manicennui> It's basically reddit in video form.
[19:29:32] <manicennui> Top lists, talking about what is over/underrated, showing crap they buy, etc.
[19:29:54] <manicennui> I don't know how my brain got into this.
[19:30:50] <manicennui> I need to find more YTers like supereyepatchwolf.

[22:48:38] <dimadima> "There's a standard Internet phenomenon (I generalize) of a Sneer Club of people who enjoy getting together and picking on designated targets." isn't this against reddit terms nowawadays?
[22:48:42] <dimadima> what's this called
[22:49:29] <dimadima> oh yeah, "brigading"
[22:49:45] <Brekkjern> In Reddit rules, it's not brigading before you leave the sub
[22:50:04] <Brekkjern> You can talk as much shit as you want about someone as long as you stick to the same sub
[22:50:17] <dimadima> oh that's what that means
[22:50:25] <Brekkjern> Yep
[22:50:28] <dimadima> (i was just curious)
[22:50:34] <dimadima> (if ppl go shit on less wrong i don't care)
[22:50:48] <dimadima> or whatever they want to shit on, communally
[22:50:51] <Brekkjern> Brigading is just when a sub "coordinates" to invade other subs/posts do do their thing
[22:51:26] <dimadima> i read " getting together and picking on designated targets" as such
[22:51:34] <dimadima> $500 is decent
[22:51:36] <Brekkjern> Nah, that's just bullying
