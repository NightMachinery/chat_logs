[05:25:57] <bedlam> ktprograms, you could also try using software rendering.
[05:27:26] <bedlam> I don't know all the values, but these I do: c.qt.force_software_rendering = 'software-opengl'
[05:27:38] <bedlam> and also 'qt-quick'
[05:27:44] <cnsvc> hi | after upgraded qutebrowser (2.4.0-1 -> 2.4.0-2), the page content turns into white screen and then recover
[05:28:01] <bedlam> ktprograms, the settings needs to go in config.py
[05:28:12] <cnsvc> sometimes it's flashing with white screen 
[05:28:51] <cnsvc> is this a known issue or just me
[05:29:29] <bedlam> Have you tried running it with --temp-basedir?
[05:30:29] <bedlam> You can also use --debug --loglevel debug
[05:30:40] <bedlam> And run it from a terminal.
[05:31:04] <bedlam> I've only been running 2.4.0 for a day or so,but I haven't seen that yet.
[05:31:44] <bedlam> cnsvc, ^
[05:33:18] <cnsvc> bedlam: ok let me try these first

[05:45:07] *** Joins: ff0x (~f0xy@gateway/tor-sasl/ff0x)
[05:52:53] <cnsvc> it looks the issue is still there while enabling temp/debug and logs. i had the log but no clue. https://bit.ly/3DWvLRw
[05:54:06] <ktprograms> bedlam: How can I verify that software rendering is enabled? I put that line you sent in ~/.config/qutebrowser/config.py (just the top level since the file didn't exist previously), and ran :config-source ~/.config/qutebrowsr/config.py, but when opening youtube the renderer process still crashes
[05:55:25] <ktprograms> In :version, it shows that a config.py in /tmp/qutebrowser-basedir-*/config/config (the * is me too lazy to type the actual random chars), but that file doesn't exist in the fs.
[05:56:49] <bedlam> cnsvc, try filtering the output: --logfilter webview
[05:57:13] <bedlam> There might be some other filters.  You'll need to check the --help output.
[05:58:52] <cnsvc> bedlam: I see. I will find out later.
[05:59:05] <bedlam> ktprograms, ~/.config/qutebrowser/config.py should be sourced at startup so need to do it manually.  If you open the QB command prompt and type :set render<tab> it should autocomplete it, then put a space and press <tab> again.
[06:00:09] <bedlam> ktprograms, config.py won't load from there when using --temp-basedir / -T though.
[06:01:32] <bedlam> ktprograms, check in --help if the renderer can be set using a command flag.
[06:01:55] <bedlam> AFAIK it needs to be set before QB starts up properly.
[06:02:06] <ktprograms> bedlam: I removed --temp-basedir, and with either software-opengl or qt-quick, the renderer process still crashes
[06:02:29] <bedlam> On all pages or one URL?
[06:02:45] <ktprograms> bedlam: youtube.com
[06:03:22] <bedlam> are you using qt built with proprietay codecs?
[06:04:22] <ktprograms> bedlam: I'm using the default Alpine Linux qutebrowser, in which package's build script should I check?
[06:04:36] <bedlam> qt5
[06:05:37] <ktprograms> bedlam: These are all the qt5 packages, which should I look in? https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=qt5*&branch=edge&arch=aarch64
[06:05:47] <bedlam> Actually, I just thought of something.
[06:05:51] <bedlam> brb
[06:08:19] <bedlam> Well I thought it might say in :version but nope.
[06:09:18] <bedlam> ktprograms, in one of the qt5-webengine packages.
[06:09:38] <ktprograms> bedlam: Ah ok.

[06:11:49] *** Joins: brabrax (~brabrax@user/brabrax)
[06:12:28] <ktprograms> bedlam: Yes, it is built with proprietary codecs: https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/blob/master/community/qt5-qtwebengine/APKBUILD#L273
[06:12:35] <bedlam> The descriptions aren't great.
[06:12:53] <ktprograms> bedlam: What descriptions?
[06:13:38] <bedlam> When you click on a package name. i.e. qt5-systems: Qt Sustems.
[06:14:22] <ktprograms> I see. So why did you want to know if it's built with proprietary codecs?
[06:16:45] <bedlam> Youtube never used to work well without them.  I never saw it crash though, but thought it was worth checking.
[06:19:03] <bedlam> ktprograms, you could try the same debug/log flags I suggested to cnsvc, and run it from a terminal.
[06:19:45] <ktprograms> https://tpaste.us/n599 is the qutebrowser log output
[06:19:52] <bedlam> And --no-err-windows is useful, other it bugs the hell out of you ;-
[06:25:21] <bedlam> I see some LoadStatus.error.  I think The-Compiler might know what's going on there.
[06:25:46] <bedlam> Those errors are just above the rendered crashed screen.
[06:26:23] <bedlam> ktprograms, do you have cookies allowed and JS set on?
[06:26:47] <ktprograms> bedlam: How do I check?
[06:27:28] <bedlam> :set cookie<tab> and :set javascript<tab>
[06:28:10] <bedlam> At the end of a menu option press space and <tab> again.
[06:28:35] <bedlam> Perhaps space and <CR> too.
[06:28:59] <ktprograms> content.cookies.accept is all and content.cookies.store is true, and javascript is allowed (but js tabs and clipboard access is false)
[06:28:59] <bedlam> Your best bet is show that log to The-Compiler in the morning.
[06:29:29] <ktprograms> bedlam: Well morning for him, evening for me. Thanks anyway.
[06:30:32] <bedlam> You might want to set cookies to no-3rdparty unless you like being tracked everywhere.
[06:31:08] <ktprograms> bedlam: Thanks for the suggestion. Does that break many sites?
[06:31:14] <bedlam> You could try turning off JS and then opening youtube,
[06:31:45] <bedlam> I've not had it break any sites yet, but my range is probably a bit limited.
[06:32:04] <bedlam> In fact I have JS and cookies on toggle keybinds.
[06:32:16] <bedlam> I have them off until I need them.
[06:34:17] <bedlam> One other thing I though of is DNS precaching.  Some sites used to break unless that was turned off,
[06:34:55] <bedlam>  still have c.content.dns_prefetch               = False in config.py now.
[06:36:04] <bedlam> I'd forgotten about it.  I wonder if it speeds up QB.
[06:37:07] <ktprograms> bedlam: With disabling javascript, all I see on youtube are the video placeholders, and as soon as I enable javascript and reload, it crashes again.
[06:37:29] <bedlam> Do you have any greasemonkey scripts?
[06:38:05] <ktprograms> I doubt so. Haven't done any customization to my qutebrowser
[06:40:59] <bedlam> another setting you could try is changing the adblock method :set adblock<tab> etc.
[06:41:17] <bedlam> The new mthod is Brave's Adblock, and the old way is hosts.
[06:41:30] <bedlam> It's set to auto by default I think.
[06:42:06] <bedlam> Does it also crash when you go directly to a video page?
[06:42:19] <bedlam> Rather than the root of the site.

[06:46:43] <ktprograms> bedlam: Yes, it crashes on a video page.
[06:46:57] <ktprograms> So which adblock method are you suggesting I try?
[06:47:03] *** Joins: samhza (sam@2600:3c03::f03c:92ff:fe40:814c)
[06:47:47] <bedlam> Try the hosts first, then Brave's.
[06:48:33] <bedlam> You should also :adblock-update (before testing would be best).
[06:48:36] <bedlam> brb
[06:51:08] <ktprograms> bedlam: Crashes with both host and brave adblock. Although I don't see why adblock would crash the renderer.
[06:53:18] <bedlam> I was thinking that since most youtube videos contain ads, and Brave's is a smart blocker than plays around with blocking elements, it *might* have done something weird with any video playing.
[06:54:02] <bedlam> Are you running X11 or Wayland by the way?
[06:57:41] <bedlam> If X11, does `glxinfo | grep render' output 'direct rendering yes'?
[06:58:00] <bedlam> Plus a bunch of gl stuff?
[07:03:04] <ktprograms> bedlam: X11, direct rendering: Yes, but it is a VM and it has previously had problems with certain 3d opengl, but firefox youtube works fine.
[07:04:37] <bedlam> Do other Qt browsers like falkon work?  What about chrome/chromium?
[07:08:47] <bedlam> I wonder if it's 2D accel that's the problem.  IIRC firefox has a way of changing it from all accelerated to software etc.  There doesn't seem to be a :set option for it in QB, but there might be a flag or QT option.
[07:11:42] <bedlam> There are --qt-flag and --qt-arg but you'll have to dive into qt to find what those are, and especially any flags that affect the chromium part of the engine.
[07:12:53] <ktprograms> Firefox and Chromium don't have any problem, Falkon says 'Failed loading page' with no error number but I guess it's the same problem.
[07:13:20] <bedlam> Sounds like it.
[07:13:57] *** Joins: Itaru (~Itaru@ro2.flokinet.is)
[07:14:45] <ktprograms> bedlam: FYI Alpine uses musl libc and I'm running on aarch64 if it makes any difference.
[07:15:21] <bedlam> In the VM, the host, or both?
[07:18:08] <bedlam> There should be a setting in firefox to control 2D accel, probably in about:config or whatever it uses nowadays.  You could try forcng it on and then retesting youtube.
[07:18:33] <bedlam> Restart it first perhaps.
[07:23:22] <ktprograms> bedlam: Alpine aarch64 VM, macos M1 Big Sur host (using UTM which is a wrapper for QEMU with the virgl accel)
[07:26:31] <ktprograms> bedlam: Firefox still works even with accel force-enabled.
[07:26:40] <bedlam> ok
[07:33:29] <bedlam> Just reading on on that machine + virgl.
[07:34:13] <bedlam> The wiki page on Big Didn't mention the kernel, but does macos still run a mach?
[07:34:22] <bedlam> Big Sur
[07:35:17] <bedlam> It did mention some updated interface with blurry parts though.  Can you turn the visual effects off?
[07:36:53] <bedlam> My slackware 14.2 was released before virgl was a thing I think.
[07:37:11] <ktprograms> bedlam: What do you mean by turn the visual effects off?
[07:37:27] <bedlam> I use qemu via libvirt usually, but I stay in a CLI.
[07:37:38] <ktprograms> bedlam: I don't think the host kernel matters since it's qemu.
[07:38:18] <bedlam> It mentioned some new 'blur' parts to the interface so I wondered if it used some kind of compositing that could be turned off.
[07:38:20] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:38:59] <bedlam> Yeah, I was just curious if it ran a mach kernel, just wandering offtopic a bit :-)
[07:39:29] <ktprograms> bedlam: If you're talking about macos, there isn't any setting to change the visual effects, but in general it's not _too_ distracting. BTW what wiki are you looking at?
[07:40:06] <bedlam> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macos_Big_Sur
[07:40:35] <ktprograms> bedlam: Oh I see.
[07:41:09] <bedlam> I was wondering if some kind of compositing on the host might be affecting graphics in the guest.
[07:42:07] <ktprograms> bedlam: I don't think so. If anything it's bugs with virgl but I've never had it cause a segfault (exit code 11 is a segfault right?). So it's probably a qtwebengine problem either with musl or something else.
[07:42:18] <bedlam> Guest says 'render this please' host says 'wait a bit' guest can't wait and kills whatever it was trying to do.
[07:43:16] <bedlam> Yep, 11 = segv
[07:43:50] <bedlam> Hmm
[07:44:09] <ktprograms> bedlam: What order of magnitude of time would guest can't wait be? I don't think the effects are too heavy with the modern CPUs.
[07:44:11] <bedlam> It should dump a core too.
[07:44:27] <ktprograms> bedlam: That's the funny thing, I don't get any core dumps
[07:45:04] <bedlam> segv is a memory violation, so not what I said.
[07:45:30] <bedlam> Core dumps can be turned off system-wide though.
[07:45:58] <bedlam> ulimit -c
[07:46:06] <ktprograms> bedlam: With ulimit -c unlimited beforehand, it still doesn't generate any core dumps
[07:47:13] <bedlam> But setting ulimit -c after the machine has already set it from /etc/initscript doesn't usually work for trying to set sizes greater.
[07:47:51] <bedlam> Or I could be thinking of ulimit -l
[07:48:15] <ktprograms> bedlam: I think ulimit -c doesn't have any problem like that.

[22:36:26] <tzcrawford> Can anyone log into gitlab? When I try to load that page it just sits on a "checking your browser" page indefinitely. Apparently this is a problem with blocking fingerprinting or something like that (according to my low effort web search)
[22:38:04] <tzcrawford> This appears to still be the case if I set content blocking to false

[23:13:58] <ionen> gitlab seems fine for me, the checking browser page took like 2 seconds
