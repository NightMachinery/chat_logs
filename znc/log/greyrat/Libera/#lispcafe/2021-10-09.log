[07:24:06] <gilberth> I must confess, that implementing a network stack is a nice experience. You must consider what to do with packets, that don't make sense, when there is no associated connection. You must have retransmission counters decay, send keepalive packets, note when a connection is lost, and away any runaway ping-pong loops saturating the link, etc. Fun!

[08:30:25] <Qwnavery> gilberth: are you sharing source / have a repo somewhere?
[08:30:47] <moon-child> mfiano: I use both.  Prefer freebsd, but use linux for work
[08:31:17] <moon-child> which avatar?  Github?
[08:31:22] <mfiano> yeah
[08:33:48] <mfiano> To be honest, I haven't tried any of the BSD variants in about 25 years. The issue back then was mostly hardware compatibility, like Linux, but much worse, and lack of > 2 audio channels.
[08:34:39] <mfiano> I wonder how things have improved and if that is worth trying again. A quarter century is more than an eternity in the software world...
[08:36:02] * mfiano does not like the direction Linux has been heading for the last 10 or so years
[08:37:43] <moon-child> it is fairly decent ime.  I think the main thing to watch out for is probably wifi
[08:37:44] <mfiano> Bloated kernel, RedHat backed, monolithic systemd influencing FOSS project changes, deployment/reproducible builds, etc
[08:38:08] <moon-child> 'reproducible builds'  what's wrong with those?
[08:38:52] <mfiano> I was just stating problems with fragmented GNU/Linux distributions and libc variations
[08:38:54] <mfiano> etc
[08:39:24] * moon-child nods
[08:40:00] <mfiano> Hard to deploy something for Linux without statically linking things with musl, or using some container
[08:40:21] <mfiano> kernel interface isn't stable etc
[08:41:36] <mfiano> I don't care about/trust wifi anyway heh :)
[08:42:31] <mfiano> Maybe that will be my weekend project...re-exploring FreeBSD. I've been using Arch for more than 20 years...
[08:43:42] <moon-child> big draw of freebsd is zfs
[08:43:49] <moon-child> you can kinda do it in linux, but not as well
[08:44:07] * mfiano has used btrfs forever.
[08:45:06] * moon-child does not trust butterface.  Would probably use xfs or ext4 if pressed
[08:45:13] <moon-child> bcachefs sounds neat though
[08:45:48] <mfiano> haven't ever experienced issues with btrfs. NILFS2 (a log based filesystem that was popular back in the day was though)
[08:46:15] <mfiano> oh yeah, and Reiser [FS] murdered a few of my drives somehow
[08:46:36] <moon-child> I mean, I'm sure plenty of people use single-drive FAT and happen to not lose data.  But as far as proven track record of reliability--
[08:46:54] <moon-child> mfiano: I think he murdered a few other things too ;)
[08:46:58] <mfiano> My 50TB NAS even has btrfs running for last 5 or so years
[08:47:04] <mfiano> Yeah, that was the joke :)
[08:47:19] <hayley> "kernel interface isn't stable" Did Mauro not shut the fuck up?
[08:47:26] * hayley hasn't had lossage on /home with btrfs since 2015
[08:47:39] <moon-child> hayley: interface for writing kernel drivers.  Not userspace interface to kernel
[08:47:45] <hayley> Oh, okay.
[08:48:07] <moon-child> *bsd not stable either.  But developed in lockstep so less practically problematic
[08:49:13] <mfiano> Yeah the main attraction to me is the lockstep releases of everything
[08:49:48] <mfiano> Would also be interested in how the scheduling etc performs in comparison...i heard good things
[08:50:04] <hayley> How does CASing the CDR with CDR coding go? I guess it depends on where you put the "code" part.
[08:52:05] <mfiano> moon-child: What is the attraction of ZFS for single-drive systems? The only system that has multiple drives is my NAS.
[08:52:59] <easye> For a single drive ZFS system, I guess one doesn't have to commit to partitions.
[08:53:55] <moon-child> mfiano: reliability?  I mean I still would prefer not to lose any data if my laptop battery unexpectedly dies
[08:54:49] <moon-child> and snapshotting of course
[08:55:43] <mfiano> I guess btrfs solved all that for me except the renaming atomicity problem I suppose.
[08:55:50] <easye> I am surprised there are still BTFS partisans.  I thought active development had been abandoned in not a great state ~ three years ago.
[08:56:22] <easye> I have lost data with BTFS, but it might not entirely have been BTFS's fault.
[08:56:39] <mfiano> easye: I have not formatted a filesystem in many years. Jeez, I still have Arch machines running that were installed >20 years ago.
[08:57:09] <mfiano> and it's BTRFS
[08:57:20] <moon-child> feature-wise btrfs is probably close-enough to parity.  But again, I do not trust it to be as reliable
[09:01:53] <mfiano> Ah cool, OpenZFS added zstd support last year
[09:02:20] <mfiano> That's what I liked a lot about btrfs over the (then) alternatives

[09:37:49] <hayley> Well, Shinmera handled it better than I would have.
[09:39:21] <mfiano> Again, you're ignoring the fact that YOU are in the wrong here. You, personally, have wasted three days of my life.
[09:39:22] <mfiano> This is what is wrong with open source.
[09:39:24] <mfiano> xD
[09:39:36] <mfiano> I agree. I would have tore into him.
[09:39:53] <hayley> "Go fuck yourself." *closes issue*
[09:40:02] <moon-child> oof.  Wow
[09:41:26] <hayley> FWIW I no longer say the "(currently)" part of "Ethical software is (currently) a sad joke" since they show no signs of stopping like 6 months later.
[09:42:38] * mfiano doesn't even understand the whole ethical software movement in the slightest
[09:42:59] <hayley> Dumb theory: in CL you end up producing a lot of helper libraries. Nothing wrong with that, but you get to play both roles of producer and consumer. So you quickly learn not to call software that you didn't write rude names.
[09:43:46] <mfiano> Makes sense.
[09:44:49] <hayley> mfiano: What it should be (IMO) is people critical of the grind-shit-out-quickly process that modern software development often follows, and all the bogosity that follows (burning yourself out, calling people rude names cause you disagree with them, etc). What it is in reality is people calling everyone they don't like a techbro, and slandering every software developer in existence.
[09:45:22] <mfiano> Reminds me why I am no longer on Discord.
[09:45:28] <mfiano> The Lisp Discord to be exact
[09:45:45] <hayley> Not sure if I want to ask why?
[09:49:41] <hayley> (There is also the case that, if you give software out for free as in $0, then people shouldn't try to skim money off you, which is similar but orthogonal to viral licensing (e.g GPL) or not (BSD). I would usually agree with the idea, but some people "extrapolate" and decide that the way to avoid it is rather to invent proprietary software again; and GPL weenies don't like the idea of not giving people that "freedom". Thus, it's another
[09:49:41] <hayley> movement.)
[09:49:53] <mfiano> Drama. I was talking to another fellow admin about how I wanted to rewrite one of (not even his) libraries because it'd be too much work to extend for the use-case I needed, and would likely result in rewriting most of it anyway. They took this as an attack on that project, and lashed out at me personally and the other people involved in the rewrite, with an emphasis on "personally", unrelated to
[09:49:55] <mfiano> any software.
[09:50:03] <hayley> Ow.
[09:50:16] <mfiano> And because I was an admin and I manage the lispgames community etc, I didn't want to be associated with that venue.
[09:50:24] <mfiano> So I deleted all my messages and left.
[09:54:10] <mfiano> I mean no offense to younger people, but Discord is full of immature, power hungry people, probably because of the demography. I don't think I'm missing much.
[09:54:45] <hayley> Checks out. Though I'm stuck trying to clean the crap out of the server that a friend from high school "runs".
[09:55:53] * moon-child lacks the bandwidth for more than one chat platform, so sticks with irc
[09:56:40] <dave0> i too have limited brainwidth
[09:57:48] <mfiano> I dislike Discord for other reasons, such as them requiring the use of such a resource intensive client or risk being banned, and them being a subsidiary of a shady Chinese company accused of data privacy related things in the past...
[09:59:56] <mfiano> I don't get the desire for rendering graphical emoticons, displaying huge images or previews interleaved throughout conversations, etc. I think chat belongs in a simple text protocol like IRC, used in a textual terminal application (though users that feel otherwise can still use graphical renderers)
[10:00:20] * hayley uploaded an image: (19KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/lkEwjOgiaSCahPUvidIfzIvr/bruhcha.jpg >

[10:01:23] <hayley> Where do they get 90% of the memes? I don't think r/lispmemes has the throughput, so it's likely I don't understand most either.
[10:03:14] <mfiano> I really enjoy having all of my applications accessible in a vte session, sans emacs and a web browser unfortunately.

[10:08:33] <mfiano> moon-child: Does the ports client install binaries, from source, or "it depends"?
[10:08:50] <moon-child> mfiano: ports install from source 99% of the time
[10:09:03] <moon-child> I think there's, like, two ports that install closed-source binary-only packages
[10:09:10] <mfiano> I see. How is build reliability?
[10:09:26] <moon-child> you mean like source builds failing?  Never happened to me

[10:15:23] <mfiano> As a game developer, intel is out of the question.
[10:15:56] <moon-child> sure.  But the general point applies
[10:16:21] <mfiano> I only use it to make sure nothing crashes, which happens quite a bit actually, because Mesa developers like to rely on floating point traps in shader linking code
[10:18:31] <mfiano> Jokes on me then. All of my machines have nvidia cards, because in my experience it conforms to OpenGL better than the others.
[10:19:20] <moon-child> I have heard that nvidia drivers are more tolerant of incorrect than others; mesa is stricter about compliance
[10:19:22] <moon-child> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[10:21:37] <mfiano> Maybe, it's been a while since I saw any stats.
[10:22:06] <mfiano> But the biggest point is, as a game developer, I can't be confined to a single vendor.
[10:22:34] <moon-child> fair enough
[10:24:08] <mfiano> I don't have any amd cards because $ and rely on testing on the other 2 will be enough until i do :/

[11:22:00] <mfiano> The simple answer is that free memory is wasted memory. Any memory that programs do not actively allocate is used within the FreeBSD kernel as disk cache.

[14:59:45] <ck_> so 1984 won against Brave New World now, clearly

[15:00:49] <pjb> ck_: not really: we get a mix of both.
[15:01:01] <humasect> brave new world was meh; kind of written by psychologist historian not exactly a story but a long essay

[15:02:04] <ck_> because you don't agree with me I'll take a soma vacation to escape these terrible feelings
[15:02:42] <pjb> humasect: a plan.

[15:05:17] <shka> selwyn: also, "that was the "slav engineering" tutorial :P
[15:05:28] <humasect> its why im scared to write; what if it comes true? (Inkheart style)

[23:43:38] <manicennui> Creating hierarchical relationships in RDBMS is not hard, but querying them in a performant way often is.
[23:44:12] <manicennui> You can do something like pjb describes, and then as a performance hack, add the base node to all nodes.
[23:44:30] <shka> yeah, but the recursive common table expressions seem to work fine with PG
