[01:57:09] <lantech19446> welp I might be making my first steps towards devops much sooner than I thought
[01:58:38] <rawtaz> how's that
[02:00:12] <lantech19446> so I reached out to a recruiter and asked them specifically for a critique of my resume I didn't feel qualified for the role they had advertised but wanted some pointers. They put me in for the job anyway they say my resume looks great and that the requirements are really just a wish list and they can't wait to talk to me. It's not a devops role per se but it's lots of azure cloud stuff and
[02:00:14] <lantech19446> virtualization which will certainly take me a step in the right direction
[02:01:02] <rawtaz> lantech19446: nice
[02:01:09] <rawtaz> yes that will get you useful experience
[02:01:24] <rawtaz> as long as you dont forget that there's a non-microsoft world out there..
[02:02:29] <lantech19446> I'd love to get away from it sooner than later I prefer linux but if it's going to double my income and get me experience it's gonna be hard to turn down. The only thing I need to be absolutely sure of is I can maintain my level of health benefits that's not negotiable
[02:02:57] <rawtaz> thres plenty of places using azure even if theyre not a windows show, e.g. due to cost strategy and what not
[02:04:00] <lantech19446> at the moment I have no cloud experience so anything is better than nothing right now
[02:04:31] <rawtaz> yep!
[02:06:47] <lantech19446> I'm excited and nervous at the same time
[02:12:35] <rawtaz> sounds normal
[02:16:53] <lantech19446> I guess but after being at this job for 13yrs leaving kind of sucks, all they have to do is pay me what i'm worth and I'd retire from here
[02:17:18] <rawtaz> can you rephrase that?
[02:17:55] <lantech19446> in what way?
[02:18:30] <rawtaz> try to adapt it to my IQ
[02:18:34] <rawtaz> it's about 34
[02:19:14] <rawtaz> anyway never mind, its not important
[02:19:18] <lantech19446> I've been at this job for a really long time over 13 years now and they're paying me 15 dollars an hour if they doubled it so I was making what most systems admins are making I'd never leave
[02:19:51] <lantech19446> I really do love this job it's just I can't make ends meet my life is stagnant because of it

[02:20:04] <rawtaz> aaah. by "retire from here" you meant "work here until i retire". now i get it
[02:20:42] <lantech19446> sorry maybe that way of saying it isn't as common as I thought
[02:20:57] <rawtaz> nah its probalby just language barrier, im not american
[02:21:03] <lantech19446> o ok
[02:21:25] <lantech19446> well then not an IQ issue on your part, you're not even speaking your native language and I never knew it
[02:24:20] <rawtaz> haha
[02:24:25] <rawtaz> does that mean your english sucks? :D
[02:24:48] <lantech19446> it might lol sometimes I think I speak French better than English
[02:25:13] <rawtaz> oh my
[02:25:17] <rawtaz> how come you know french?
[02:25:42] <lantech19446> I took 3 years of it in high school went to a total immersion camp for a summer and then lived there for half a year
[02:25:50] <rawtaz> oh man
[02:25:53] <rawtaz> thats hard
[02:26:15] <lantech19446> I also speak a little bit of Indonesian and Afrikaans
[02:26:35] <rawtaz> are you a polyglot having an easy time learning languages?
[02:27:13] <lantech19446> especially when i'm shagging some bird that speaks them
[02:27:22] <rawtaz> lol
[02:28:38] <lantech19446> I used to date au pairs lol

[04:51:48] <lantech19446> So I just saw a job looking for someone versed in ELK stack having never heard of this I looked it up, it looks kind of interesting not so much by bag but interesting regardless. Is this popular? It's the first time I've seen it mentioned
[05:41:38] <dodo> um.. wat.. elk has been popular enough for amazon to fork it..
[05:56:47] <Joel> dodo yeah, kinda funny, lol
[05:59:14] <Joel> es is almost a decade old

[23:44:36] <lantech19446> business internet there is no l1-3 it's them or an engineer
[23:44:47] <themachine> oof
[23:44:57] <themachine> lol
[23:44:59] <lantech19446> my reaction exactly lol
[23:45:04] <themachine> so it an L1 or an engineer hahaha
[23:45:28] <lantech19446> I now have to wait for an engineer to get back to me because not one of them knows when the certificate will renew because they don't know what it is or that it existed
[23:46:27] <lantech19446> it's only got 17 days left on it all I wanted was a simple it renews at x days left or oh shit it should have renewed at 30 days lets find out what's wrong
[23:49:06] <themachine> I'm sure they'll get it renewed a few days after expiration
[23:49:08] <themachine> :)
[23:50:51] <lantech19446> yea meanwhile we'll be dead in the water but you're most likely right
