[16:16:05] <fearnothing> hola docker folks, I have a question about how to architect an app/service based on what will function best from the docker side... I have a web app which will produce jobs, which will be run by a bit of nodejs in a docker container; each job will take ~30 seconds, and produce some files that need to be returned to the web app and some data to insert in to the database
[16:18:14] <fearnothing> the question is, how do I know whether it's more appropriate to have the job consumer run within the docker container, i.e. have the workers as constantly-running containers, or have the consumer be an external process that spins up a container in response to receiving a job?
[16:26:42] <fearnothing> I definitely want to do the latter if it's not too resource intensive, being able to guarantee a completely clean environment for each job will be beneficial
[16:26:59] <rawtaz> fearnothing: where is this to be hosted?
[16:27:52] <fearnothing> currently the app runs entirely within a single VM in my living room :P
[16:28:42] <rawtaz> honestly i think a more common pattern for such small scale would be to just have the webapp, a queue, and the processor in three different containers.
[16:28:46] <rawtaz> running all the time
[16:29:02] <rawtaz> why do you feel a need to restart the processor container?
[16:30:36] <fearnothing> the task will be running puppeteer over web pages and I want to ensure each job is not affected by results of other jobs; the alternative will be to clear out cache etc between jobs
[16:32:57] <fearnothing> I guess that point does indicate one good reason to have constantly-running containers for the processor, the node_modules for the processor is nearly 500MB because of Chromium
[16:33:26] <rawtaz> its a bit ass backwards i feel :D i mean, when you have a queue there's a consumer that polls it usually, to find stuff to process
[16:33:41] <rawtaz> i guess the queue container COULD spawn a processing container, but it isnt right
[16:33:56] <rawtaz> just starting the processor container now and then to check might be an option but that too is ugly
[16:34:15] <rawtaz> having the web container start the processing container by sending some signal could be another option, not too clean either though
[16:34:39] <rawtaz> having a fourth container that is running all the time to just check the queue and fire up the processing container when needed might be the better option in this scenario.
[16:34:54] <fearnothing> I'm planning to use redis for the queue, not cos I need the performance, but because it's convenient to code for
[16:35:00] <rawtaz> that container would presumably have to be able to access the docker socket which isnt great.
[16:35:06] <rawtaz> right
[16:35:14] <rawtaz> i think redis has pubsub so your fourth container could use that

[16:36:55] <fearnothing> ah sorry missed that line
[16:37:02] <rawtaz> because you dont want the processing container to run all the time, and the queue and web containers shouldnt be concerned with starting the processing container.
[16:37:52] <fearnothing> and you also don't want to limit access to docker socket to something that can be locked down fairly solidly yeah?
[16:38:06] <fearnothing> er
[16:38:08] <fearnothing> -don't
[16:38:11] <rawtaz> sorry can you rephrase that?
[16:38:13] <rawtaz> oh
[16:38:35] <fearnothing> I started writing it in a different order, then changed it halfway through and forgot to fix the beginning :P
[16:38:39] <rawtaz> yes, access to the docker socket == root on your system (unless you run docker rootless, and generally speaking)
[16:38:51] <rawtaz> and by system i mean the host
[16:39:35] <fearnothing> yeah I got that :) I do security and have picked up that docker socket access by unintended people = you're having a bad day
[16:39:47] <rawtaz> so; such a fourth container would need to be as super simple as possible, the simplest possible code to check for things needing processing and to fire up the container. it should also probably use the docker-socket-proxy image instead of getting direct access to the socket file
[16:39:54] <rawtaz> oh nice :)
[16:40:02] <rawtaz> can you elaborate a bit on what you do in terms of security?
[16:40:12] <rawtaz> im curious

[16:41:24] <rawtaz> interesting. cool

[16:42:20] <rawtaz> its on docker hub
[16:43:00] <rawtaz> i have only configured it for reading status of docker containers, and for that you only ned to set the CONTAINERS env var to 1 (besides the defaults), and none of the others. but if you also need to command docker to start a container, you presumably need something more enabled.
[16:43:24] <fearnothing> have not touched docker before, this is coming out of the app being written and some friends saying "hey that's cool but can you put it in docker instead?" and me saying "yeah, I should uh, learn docker. Someday."
[16:43:40] <rawtaz> oh. sorry to hear that :P
[16:44:27] <fearnothing> sorry? it sounds useful
[16:44:56] <rawtaz> yeah i just mean like having to wrap your head around docker and configuring it/Dockerfiles/compose files properly isnt something you normally do just like that :)
[16:45:20] <fearnothing> I've noticed ;-) hence me coming in here with nooby questions after reading a few web pages
[16:45:24] <rawtaz> its kind of like one of them "oh let me just do this real quick" and then it turns out theres so much more to know to do it properly :>
[16:45:28] <rawtaz> hehe yeah
[16:45:30] <rawtaz> np
[16:46:02] <fearnothing> well yeah, if it were easy there wouldn't be all the warnings about doing it wrong and someone getting root on your system :D
[16:46:18] <rawtaz> honestly, your architecture would be simplified if you had the processing container run continously (and subscribing to the queue). is it really problematic to just have it re-run jobs, clearing cache between runs?
[16:46:19] <fearnothing> I knew what I was getting in to, kinda
[16:47:02] <rawtaz> there is indeed some validity to it being spun up anew, that ensures nothing from previous run affected it, im just pondering if it's worth the added complexity, it of course boils down to in what ways there's possibility to affect subsequent runs.
[16:47:23] <rawtaz> you probably have the brains to assess that
[16:48:00] <fearnothing> actually I don't know. That's partly why I'm asking if the spawning a fresh container was sensible, because if the answer is "not really", then I should go learn what I need to do to clear chrome out instead
[16:49:26] <rawtaz> others here are more skilled with docker than i am, but i think my stance is that "it's doable, and if it makes sense since it's vital to have a fresh container instead of a cleaned up one for the processing, and you know the risks and how to configure it reasonably securely, then sure, why not"
[16:49:43] <fearnothing> the ways which could affect subsequent runs would be (1) store something that can be identified in a subsequent run (cookie basically, though there might be other ways to do it), or (2) exploit chrome
[16:50:16] <rawtaz> what does that processing container actually do? it fires up chrome to digest a website and check stuff?
[16:50:51] <fearnothing> yep, I've got it spitting out a HAR file, screenshots, and some other bits of metadata

[16:52:49] <fearnothing> (HAR = HTTP Archive, basically a record of everything that a browser did - in case you didn't know already)
[16:53:44] <rawtaz> was just looking that up. i suppose it's in a more web browser relevant format than the actual network traffic like from tcpdump
[16:53:57] <rawtaz> well, in that case, seems like it's simpler to just spin up containers
[16:53:58] <fearnothing> oh it's tons of things
[16:54:32] <rawtaz> spinning up containers for htis type of works is indeed the normal way to do it. it's just that if you only have docker and docker-compose its not really suited for that. i guess the closest would be docker swarm.
[16:54:53] <rawtaz> have you considered using cloud services? that way you can just make an API call to spin a container up
[16:55:10] <fearnothing> it's a JSON file, records all of the requests and the responses including timings, headers sent and returned, DNS lookups and their results, it even tells you exactly what line and character in which javascript resource triggered a particular request
[16:55:35] <rawtaz> otherwise, having your own orchestrator i guess would be the next step (at least after docker swarm), but all of these things beyond what you have now, and that isnt cloud, is going to require management nodes and shit i think
[16:56:03] <rawtaz> right. and it does include *all* resources that were on the site as well? images, scripts, wasm, whatever?
[16:56:08] <fearnothing> cloud services was the reason I was asked to docker it up
[16:56:56] <fearnothing> the eventual idea was for the app to sit on some VPS or VMware VM the user wanted, and to be able to spin up the processor either locally, or in AWS, or whatever else
[16:57:04] <rawtaz> they want to run it in the cloud in the end? then theres little point bothering with this, just make that fourth container that does the spinning up and be done with it :)
[16:57:13] <fearnothing> they were talking about wanting to do it as a lambda function
[16:57:22] <rawtaz> both aws and azure has simple "spin up a container quickly" thing
[16:57:47] <rawtaz> hmm yeah. i wonder if thats doable - can you run that type of stuff in lambda? not sure
[16:57:59] <rawtaz> i mean this isnt a snippet of code, this is a *process* youre running
[16:58:25] <rawtaz> i know you can *pacakge* your function as a container image though
[16:58:29] <fearnothing> yeah I don't know enough about lambda to say whether it's viable
[16:58:46] <fearnothing> I assumed the person asking knew what they were talking about
[16:58:55] <fearnothing> that may not have been the case :P
[16:58:56] <rawtaz> maybe it's doable :) im just not sure why you'd squeeze this into lambda when there's already container services.
[16:59:00] <rawtaz> haha
[16:59:07] <rawtaz> oh well. for now just get it running then :)
[16:59:25] <fearnothing> yeah cheers!
[16:59:31] <rawtaz> just keep that fourth container minimal and secure and youll be fine
