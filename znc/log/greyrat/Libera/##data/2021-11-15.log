[15:51:36] <SageKhan> I need to make a multilingual Automatic Speech recognition system. I have collected the data set of about 200 GB. I want to know how to prepare/preprocess the data for training it offline on my system. After training I want to implment it on live calls and on recorded as well. Can anyone help me on doing this on LUDWIG-AI made by UBER AI
