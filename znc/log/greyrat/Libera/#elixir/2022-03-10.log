[02:05:32] <mouseghost> symb0l, i dont have a test env. on hand, but what if you just pass an integer to the :value opt. in push/2? https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/bindings.html#click-events
[02:12:59] <hoppity> symb0l: I believe the information from coming from the template onto the liveview always goes in text form. You have to use String.to_integer.
[02:13:55] <symb0l> Yeah, its passed as strings

[16:21:27] <mhmd> no, I didn't know that it could do that! I found https://stackoverflow.com/a/32436384/14705542 which is for 2015 and jose mentions that it's proposed
[16:22:41] <mhmd> oh, I think I got something wrong
[16:23:08] <mhmd> you said it can't emit them, which means it won't be evaluated lazily 
[16:25:15] <mhmd> and lazy evaluation is what I meant, I should've mentioned it in my question
[16:27:11] <benwilson512> mhmd: right, you can do `for x <- some_stream, do:` but you can't get `for` to return a stream struct, it is still eager

[18:16:55] <Poeticode> You could separate the code into a new file that app.js imports, but the compiled code will be just as bloated lol

[20:03:57] <bluehat> I suppose it depends how you want to make your queries. Ecto uses the Postgrex library to make calls into postgres so if you're making just one or two small queries then maybe that's enough. If your queries are likely to change frequently or be more complex, I'd probably just go with ecto.

[20:05:10] <symb0l> Yeah, queries are going to get large. Basically it's a reporting api to generate reports and serialize them to json from a huge db
[20:05:51] <symb0l> what we have no is written in ruby and it's slow, consuming tons of memory and not scaling well at all
[20:05:55] <symb0l> s/no/now
[20:06:17] <bluehat> I'd probably go with Ecto, it's super clear how the query results are structured etc based on the schemas you've created etc.
[20:06:41] <bluehat> What's consuming tons of memory, the ruby service handling the query result, the query against the pg database, or just a huge result set?
[20:08:00] <symb0l> Its just badly coded to begin with, but there's so much tech debt baked into it, its easier to re-write to module at this point. and i'd rather go with something that can scale easier when we need it to
[20:10:37] *** Joins: toulene (~toulene@user/toulene)
[20:13:27] <bluehat> If your aim is long term code health then ecto is a decent way to go imo. It's clear, well documented, and the patterns to use it are well understood. Also lots of other libraries connect with it well should you ever expand the scope.
[20:14:11] <symb0l> Thanks, that's perfect then.
[20:14:20] <bluehat> No problem
[20:15:29] <Nicd> Ecto is de facto at this point
[20:31:05] *** Joins: mcint (mcint@user/mcint)
[20:39:09] <benwilson512> symb0l: to your question from earlier
[20:39:31] <benwilson512> it generally isn't a huge issue to have all of the JS in one file, even if there is page specific code because the end user will only ever end up downloading it once anyway
[20:39:35] <benwilson512> after that it's just cached by the browser
[20:40:11] <benwilson512> if you have some super heavy weight stuff that is only for one page then it can make sense to pull it out
[20:40:28] <benwilson512> but for a function here or there the extra complexity just isn't really worth it IMHO
