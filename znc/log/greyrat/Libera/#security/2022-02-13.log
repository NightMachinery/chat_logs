[23:07:33] <flyback> euphoricallysane, a lot of consumer devices like routers, tv's, cable modems, hard drives
[23:07:38] <flyback> have hidden serial debug ports
[23:07:51] <euphoricallysane> Yes friend, I know of such ports
[23:07:56] * euphoricallysane jtags his toaster
[23:08:19] <flyback> it's slower part then the cp2104
[23:08:23] <flyback> 4mbit vs 12mbit
[23:08:26] <euphoricallysane> Oh, and my ethernet having dishwasher... just why, why
[23:08:33] <flyback> but most uarts don't runfaster than 115,200 baud anyways

[23:11:28] <euphoricallysane> Speaking of a device that needs a spanking, maybe I'll port openwrt to this Puma5 cable modem, today.
[23:12:32] <euphoricallysane> Uses crappy mediatek transcievers, though, ugh
[23:12:40] <euphoricallysane> gpl anticompliance and all
[23:12:56] <euphoricallysane> Which is funny, bc Intel/TI were supposed to be on point about that

[23:14:41] <flyback> I hooked to a uart on a motorola cable modem many yrs ago when it failed
[23:14:53] <flyback> try to get it to factory reset and pull the config file from comcast
[23:14:55] <flyback> no luck
[23:15:07] <euphoricallysane> Docsis 2+ was a pain for that kind of thing
[23:15:18] <euphoricallysane> Docsis 1 was the wild west :)
[23:15:33] <flyback> th egear etc have defintely improved over the last 20 yrs
[23:15:42] <flyback> my folks here had a bad unit but comcast finally repalced it

[23:16:28] <flyback> every cable co with this modem was out of luck
[23:16:29] <euphoricallysane> I got this for $3 at a thrift shop. I figured that it would break up a rainy/snowwy day
[23:16:47] <euphoricallysane> I've been slacking with regard to embedded, as of late
[23:17:49] <flyback> I been learning to hack flash drives

[23:18:08] <flyback> and backed them up and erased them for reuse
[23:18:16] <flyback> so I had a bunch to play with vendor factory tools
[23:18:28] <flyback> make them read only, which is really useful for bootable pc erasing tools
[23:18:36] <flyback> so it doesn't erase the usb stick you booted from
[23:18:39] <euphoricallysane> Always fun
[23:18:52] <flyback> yep I lost a few sticks with stuff on them thta way :(
[23:19:06] <flyback> I also seperated sticks with data to only be ones worn aroudn my neck
[23:19:12] <flyback> no more mixing with bootable sticks
[23:19:15] <flyback> so I can't lose data
[23:19:40] <flyback> it's neat you can make a stick emulate different things
[23:19:48] <flyback> zip disk, floppy, cd/dvd, hd, removable
[23:19:54] <euphoricallysane> usb can be fun
[23:19:54] <flyback> do a secure hidden spot with a pw
[23:20:00] <flyback> write protect the usb
[23:20:14] <flyback> and also divide the space on a usb flash drive into multiple virtual disks

[23:21:10] <euphoricallysane> For bootables, I've been using an old pixel 1 with block emulation for some time
[23:21:51] <euphoricallysane> I suppose that I could make it better and split it between that and dun if I want to dick around with the kernel code, but not necessary
[23:22:23] <flyback> sadly no vendor tools for sandisk drives
[23:22:46] <flyback> they also obfuscate their controler or use their own and hide it in firmware
[23:23:31] <flyback> I have about 10 or 12 with phison controllers, some with chips bank, 5 smi, and 2 alcor
[23:23:39] <flyback> phison has the best luck so far

[23:28:55] <flyback> the phison are 8051 based but they don't have a uart
[23:29:09] <flyback> I am hoping one of the other controllers does, it would be neat to hookup to the uart and watch the drive
