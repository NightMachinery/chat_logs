[00:00:21] <CountDeMoney> so that when your future self is reading, and has these question ("hmm, I wonder what Mom was doing at this time", etc.)
[00:00:21] <Urchin[emacs]> don't have friends
[00:00:25] <CountDeMoney> you'll have those answers.
[00:00:41] <CountDeMoney> Urchin[emacs]: write about how you're going to conquer the world
[00:00:58] <CountDeMoney> the point is to capture your emotions, your way of writing, your personality
[00:01:09] <Berlin36> do you write on paper?
[00:01:15] <CountDeMoney> nah i use  atext editor
[00:01:19] <Berlin36> oh
[00:01:20] <CountDeMoney> *text editor
[00:01:27] <Berlin36> but earlier?
[00:01:28] <CountDeMoney> I've used pen & paper on trips sometimes when I didn't bring my la;top
[00:01:30] <CountDeMoney> laptop *
[00:01:36] <Berlin36> i see
[00:01:45] <CountDeMoney> then I transcribed them to computer once i got back
[00:01:45] <Berlin36> do you encrypt the files ? :D
[00:01:54] <CountDeMoney> I should
[00:01:59] <Berlin36> yeah u should
[00:02:01] <CountDeMoney> I mean my backup drives ar eencrypted
[00:02:01] <Berlin36> use gpg
[00:02:08] <CountDeMoney> well
[00:02:11] <CountDeMoney> I'd encrypt the filesystem
[00:02:17] <Berlin36> yeah not bad either
[00:02:31] <Berlin36> i'd use encfs
[00:02:35] <Berlin36> like an encrypted folder
[00:02:51] <Berlin36> annnd
[00:02:59] <Berlin36> so you write everything in separate files?
[00:03:03] <Berlin36> do*
[00:03:31] <CountDeMoney> yeah there are separate files for separat ethings
[00:05:02] <Berlin36> and if i wrote a journal, idk in what language would it be lmao
[00:05:08] <Berlin36> seems like an odd concern but
[00:05:20] <Berlin36> my native language is romanian, and i kinda speak it only at school
[00:05:23] <Berlin36> and at home
[00:05:34] <Berlin36> english, well a lot when online
[00:05:43] <Berlin36> a lot when reading and watching something
[00:05:51] <Berlin36> and also russian 
[00:07:18] <Berlin36> im more of an "online" person, so pretty much everything i do is in english or russian, feels odd 
[00:09:04] <Berlin36> wow, CountDeMoney, i looked through that subreddit, and people take journaling to a whole new level :D
[00:09:16] <Sxem> Paradox Interactive planned to release Stellaris in China, but failed to obtain the approval. The studio speculated the reason for this was that the game allows players to choose the type of government of its spacefaring nation such as a religious death cult, criminal enterprise, or democracy
[00:11:48] <Berlin36> minus 300 social points for Paradox >:(

[01:50:23] <CountDeMoney> bco1981?
[01:50:38] <Bco1981> haven't seen the first yet
[01:50:42] <CountDeMoney> !
[01:50:43] <CountDeMoney> ok
[01:51:11] <CountDeMoney> I recommend it as circa-1998 pop culture
[01:55:49] <emmeka> it's interesting how Cowboy Bebop wasn't that popular or celebrated in Japan, but it made such a huge impact here just because it was the debut anime series on Adult Swim, and one of the very first anime ever with an actually good English dub

[02:32:23] <MootPoot> Interdimentional noodle wagon

[15:48:33] <Snake`s_Ghost> amigojapan, this is a naming issue
[15:48:48] <Snake`s_Ghost> what you refer to as an orange pumpkin is not the same thing as the pumpkins we carve for halloween
[15:48:56] <Snake`s_Ghost> and you do not eat such a pumpkin
[15:49:06] <Snake`s_Ghost> not usually
[15:49:17] <Snake`s_Ghost> in fact, the canned pumpkin pie is actually made from squash xD

[15:51:07] <JesseDesu> should i be washing my rice before i cook it
[15:51:12] <JesseDesu> to avoid arsenic poisoning
[15:51:25] <Snake`s_Ghost> what do you think JesseDesu ?
[15:51:36] <JesseDesu> i dont know
[15:51:57] <mixfix41> !c arsenic
[15:51:58] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33. Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with sulfur and metals, but also as a pure elemental crystal. Arsenic is a metalloid.
[15:51:58] <JesseDesu> maybe its prewashed?
[15:52:08] <JesseDesu> they dont say it sometimes
[15:52:13] <amigojapan> Jesse in Japan they sell prewashed rice and it's not now expensive

[15:57:18] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Parboiling is the partial or semi boiling of food as the first step in cooking. The word is from the Old French 'parboillir' but by mistaken association with 'part' it has acquired its current meaning.
[15:57:23] <Berlin36> ay it's Halloween today
[15:57:25] <JesseDesu> idk
[15:57:33] <Berlin36> do you celebrate halloween?
[15:57:48] <amigojapan> Jesse there is a word "prop
[15:57:57] <amigojapan> !c prop
[15:57:58] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: A prop, formally known as property, is an object used on stage or screen by actors during a performance or screen production. In practical terms, a prop is considered to be anything movable or portable on a stage or a set, distinct from the actors, scenery, costumes, and electrical equipment.

[16:00:44] <JesseDesu> as in political amendments
[16:00:50] <Berlin36> it's pretty much the same as in c++
[16:01:00] <Berlin36> but has some specific details

[16:01:12] <proppotatoxel[m]> JesseDesu: q:
[16:01:26] <Berlin36> overall i like golang, have a lot more to learn, but everything seems so clear and easy to use here
[16:01:50] <JesseDesu> c++ has that pointer contructor polymorphism shit i dont understand
[16:01:58] <JesseDesu> not that i understand anything about programming
[16:01:58] <Berlin36> yeah fuck pointers :(
[16:02:11] <proppotatoxel[m]> i tried rust but my strinqgs didnt live long enough
[16:02:15] <zoidberg> No, pointers fuck you
[16:02:20] <JesseDesu> i wanna try docker
[16:02:25] <Berlin36> that's true  zoidberg
[16:02:26] <zoidberg> If you’re not careful
[16:02:31] <JesseDesu> but even then its got a lot of steps
[16:02:43] <Berlin36> yeah, learning golang, i've encountered only one place where i can use pointers
[16:02:54] <Berlin36> so you don't copy arrays while changing them
[16:02:58] <Berlin36> kind of
[16:02:58] <proppotatoxel[m]> JesseDesu: more than 1
[16:03:40] <Berlin36> and there are slices that if asigned to a new variable and then changed, it basically changes the original slice too
[16:03:45] <Berlin36> idk how to explain tho
[16:03:49] <Berlin36> but it's pretty fun
[16:03:57] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I am on the 7th floor of the hotel so I think even if there is a tsunami I will be ok
[16:04:04] <JesseDesu> pointers also mean tips
[16:04:11] <JesseDesu> like, i'll give you some pointers
[16:04:15] <Berlin36> lol
[16:04:16] <JesseDesu> just the tip
[16:04:25] <zoidberg> The hate for pointers is unreasonable. They aren’t hard to understand. I had more trouble with arrays. I miss the zeroth one and fuck up the array.
[16:04:48] <zoidberg> More annoying is different languages do it differently
[16:04:49] <Berlin36> also i love that in golang there is go fmt command that just formats everything for you lol, so there will be no more arguments over what is the correct way
[16:04:53] <JesseDesu> 0 means 1 and 1 means 0
[16:05:01] <Berlin36> dude, arrays are easy
[16:05:11] <Berlin36> i understand pointers too, but i don't know where to use them
[16:05:23] <proppotatoxel[m]> Berlin36: to point
[16:05:26] <Berlin36> because umm, maybe i haven't done anything that requires pointers
[16:05:26] <proppotatoxel[m]> c:
[16:05:30] <Berlin36> yeah 
[16:05:35] <zoidberg> Sure, easy but they mess up often than pointers for me.
[16:05:40] <Berlin36> idunno
[16:05:46] <Berlin36> i understood arrays pretty well
[16:05:51] <JesseDesu> i remember the first array i ever encountered was a solar array in mech warrior 2.  the enemy was going to attack ours and i had to defend it
[16:06:06] <Berlin36> also in go there are arrays, slices and maps, which are pretty simillar 
[16:06:08] <amigojapan> Berlin36: arrays are points in C
[16:06:18] <zoidberg> I am not saying that I don’t understand Berlin36. More mistakes with arrays.
[16:06:23] <Berlin36> and also slices in go are much much much easier to use that arrays in c++

[16:29:03] <zoidberg> yes, that's it JesseDesu 
[16:29:33] <mixfix41> but i think they said the route they took was soggy that day strangely and the better fire spot was higher where there was a cold surge so she went to  the forest embankment where it was less of a better spot to light a fire
[16:29:46] <zoidberg> he jokes about how Everest has become metaphor
[16:30:15] <mixfix41> and it was actually august too in summer or something
[16:30:23] <mixfix41> but got mysteriously cold
[16:30:33] <mixfix41> or unexpectantly
[16:31:21] <mixfix41> its still doenst explain the freak outs though season hikers and panic and stuff weird stuff
[16:31:35] <mixfix41> in that particular happening
[16:32:40] <zoidberg> mixfix41: you mean the one in picture?
[16:32:48] <mixfix41> no not everest
[16:32:52] <mixfix41> its a russian group
[16:33:02] <zoidberg> ah, okay
[16:35:08] <mixfix41> the video i watch was thorough too even naming spirits because they found this particular root that had been harvest by one person and suspect likely to be sold off and the mountain spirits dont liek that
[16:35:49] <Cryowolf> I would like to climb Everest but at the same time I don't want to die. But if I ever get told I have a few months to live. I'm going to Everest to climb to the top and then have sex with a few farmers (legal age) daughters. Of course since I'll be sterile, none of them are pregnant. But when they tell me to leave, I tell them I'll leave if they pass the test. I show them an image of Astolfo from Fate Apocrypha and ask them what gender is 
[16:35:49] <Cryowolf> this character? If they say female, wrong, if they say male, wrong. If they say trap, congratulations, I'll leave and take my Astolfo pillow with me
[16:36:34] <Cryowolf> This is the only sensible thing to do
[16:37:54] <Bco1981> tempture is going down, covid numbers are going up... it don't everest.

[17:16:45] <Cryowolf> Within 4 months I will have a digital LN or Graphic Novel of some sort out to read for free. Not sure where you can put them. I have an illustrator and all
[17:17:14] <Cryowolf> are there any sites in English where you can upload light novels etc for people to read?
[17:17:17] <Cryowolf> similar to webtoons

[17:18:30] <JesseDesu> it does work out of the box
[17:19:06] <JesseDesu> nice
[17:19:37] <emmeka> Cryowolf if you're looking for a legit publisher, Tokyopop takes western-written, Japanese-style novels/manga
[17:19:44] <Cryowolf> no not a publisher
[17:20:12] <Cryowolf> not yet anyway
[17:20:14] <emmeka> oh, just looking for a place to publish it for the world to see?
[17:20:29] <Cryowolf> yes, I want to generate interest
[17:21:43] <emmeka> the only one I know of it Wattpad
[17:21:43] <Cryowolf> we might seek out a publisher if we end up with something we really really like
[17:21:55] <Cryowolf> but we dont want an editor to tell us what to do all the time
[17:21:58] <zoidberg> checkout webtoon, lot of authors publish there
[17:22:08] <emmeka> he's not writing comics, though
[17:22:18] <zoidberg> oh
[17:22:55] <mixfix41> you can even use tumblr ten pictures per post
[17:22:58] <emmeka> I think Wattpad has a reputation as a place where kiddos go to write very bad fanfics
[17:23:11] <emmeka> but there's probably legit literature on there as well
[17:23:27] <Cryowolf> hmmm
[17:23:48] <Cryowolf> well we're making a R rated graphic novel/light novel, we're no sure which yet
[17:24:27] <Cryowolf> violence, sexual content, profanity, drugs, mature content
[17:25:40] <Cryowolf> I'll be back here in a minute to pay more attention, in the middle of a hearthstone game

[17:29:11] <Bco1981> green green ?
[17:29:16] <emmeka> I've seen a lot of attempted intros over the years here, but opening with a trivia game is new
[17:29:25] <roshen> maybe just onions
[17:29:48] <Cryowolf> alright back
[17:29:53] <roshen> but i suppose it doesn't matter because it's translated anyway
[17:30:03] <Cryowolf> JesseDesu, no we're partners
[17:30:05] <roshen> anything that's translated can just be retranslated by me anyway
[17:30:11] <Cryowolf> JesseDesu, it's a colaboration
[17:30:22] <Cryowolf> He's very good at what he does though
[17:30:25] <roshen> nobody knows??!!!!
[17:30:33] <roshen> wow
[17:30:36] <roshen> im disappointed
[17:31:20] <mixfix41> terrible at trivia 
[17:31:20] <Cryowolf> So I'm looking for a place where people read light novels or mangas or combinations thereof. If we make a manga I guess webtoon might work. If we make a light novel I'm not sure
[17:31:24] <roshen> anime came out in 2004
[17:31:32] <roshen> and it's kinda horror genre
[17:31:37] <mixfix41> !c weakest link

[17:31:51] <ImoutoBot> roshen: I don't know.
[17:31:51] <Cryowolf> finding a publisher might be nice but having an editor that shuts down our creative freedom would suck

[17:32:50] <emmeka> Cryowolf I just said Wattpad is the only such site I know of, I'm not sure I'd suggest it.
[17:33:12] <Cryowolf> do they have adults or young adults/late teens?
[17:33:33] <Cryowolf> that would be the demographic, like 18-40 or something
[17:33:41] <roshen> nobody even cares
[17:33:52] <mixfix41> yea right it wont live up to v/h/s horror
[17:33:54] <DunceCotus> :O
[17:34:00] <mixfix41> watch v/h/s
[17:34:10] <Cryowolf> roshen, excuse me?
[17:34:40] <roshen> Cryowolf, nobody knows what the quote "onions are enough for me" is from
[17:34:42] <emmeka> Cryowolf he's complaining that nobody cares about the trivia game he randomly joined and tried to start
[17:34:45] <roshen> it's disheartening
[17:34:56] <Cryowolf> Oh I see
[17:35:30] <Cryowolf> emmeka, did you say Wattpad was mostly kiddies? Like young teens?
[17:35:50] <emmeka> I mean that's its reputation, but it's not like I've ever been there
[17:36:02] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Mieruko-chan | Episode: 5
[17:36:28] <Cryowolf> If I was making a battle shounen I guess that would be a good place, where all we made were stuff with fight after fight and really simplistic plots
[17:36:46] <DunceCotus> Wattpad 4 Kiddies
[17:36:50] <emmeka> all I can tell you is that it exists, seems to be the sort of thing you're looking for, but has a reputation as being a place where tweens post bad Twilight fanfics or whatever kids read these days
[17:37:01] <Cryowolf> but while it has battles, it's also very focused on characters and mature plots
[17:38:43] <Cryowolf> well we'll be releasing it as a fully edited and put together light novel in pdf format with panels and text placed cleanly where it should be. Revised and revised and edited to be the best it can be. Illustrations will be sketched until the best designs are found and then a full design will be created and cleaned
[17:38:58] <Cryowolf> it's not going to be an amateurish thing
[17:39:29] <Cryowolf> if we did more illustrations I guess we could use webtoon
[17:39:54] <Cryowolf> even if we threw in panels of text and narrative
[17:39:56] <emmeka> I don't think you "use" webtoons so much as pitch a series to them like any other publisher
[17:40:16] <mixfix41> roshen is it a shoujo
[17:40:37] <Cryowolf> I'm curious how much creative freedom you lose when you find a publisher though and I've seen stuff on webtoons that look AWFUL
[17:40:42] <Cryowolf> like seriously awful
[17:40:56] <Cryowolf> were they accepted by a publisher?
[17:41:44] <emmeka> you lose a lot. I think they're pretty willing to accept just about anyone to publish with them, but they axe series with little warning and then hang the creator out to dry
[17:41:55] <emmeka> also, they underpay, by a lot, compared to traditional publishers
[17:42:04] <roshen> mixfix41, it's a shounen
[17:42:08] <Cryowolf> the worse the series though, the worse your contract will be
[17:42:18] <roshen> sorry seinen
[17:42:29] <mixfix41> in the box of anime chocolates, a caramel? if so, ill be please!
[17:42:36] <roshen> and it's a classic right up there with ninja scroll and berserk
[17:42:58] <Cryowolf> emmeka, webtoons underpay? Yeah I would kind of have expected that, being Korean. Their industry eats and spits out talent
[17:43:13] <mixfix41> how much on the scale is berserk like 8 or 9 on mal
[17:43:14] <emmeka> this is what I have heard
[17:43:37] <Cryowolf> berserk manga is probably around 8-9 on mal
[17:43:43] <Cryowolf> 2016 version is probably 5-6
[17:43:44] <mixfix41> 8.51
[17:43:47] <mixfix41> yea
[17:43:57] <Cryowolf> 1997 version is probably 7ish
[17:43:58] <mixfix41> actually a favorite of nene amano
[17:44:06] <Cryowolf> the movies are probably 6-7
[17:44:08] <mixfix41> so its technically a vtubers favorite anime too

[17:45:41] <roshen> that's how berserk was
[17:45:52] <roshen> gantz has more of a resolution than berserk tho
[17:46:07] <Cryowolf> berserks story was very contained and it worked
[17:46:23] <Cryowolf> it ended at the perfect moment and finished telling a story
[17:46:30] <roshen> gantz is more contained than berserk
[17:46:46] <roshen> like the last couple eps of the berserk anime blew the top off what was contained
[17:46:49] <Cryowolf> if it has an anime only ending imma go nuke it from space
[17:47:14] <roshen> it ended literally at a point where they said there is infinitely more to this story
[17:47:20] <roshen> it drove me crazy
[17:47:23] <Cryowolf> last couple of eps of which anime? 1997 or 2016?
[17:47:40] <roshen> 97
[17:48:31] <Cryowolf> I didnt mind where 97 ended at all because it finished the story arc properly and it's not like it ended just as it began. I've seen many 11-13 episode animes do that
[17:48:37] <Cryowolf> jut when it gets interesting, it ends

[17:49:59] <Bco1981> gantz the series, then the animated movies. the story is complete.
[17:50:04] <Cryowolf> if it's gonna wait to get interesting until the ending, I won't like it
[17:50:07] <roshen> no i mean gantz is like berserk in that it finished the story arc
[17:50:19] <roshen> no it gets interesting right away
[17:50:36] <Cryowolf> I watched the first 3ish episodes, wasn't that interesting

[18:20:09] <roshen> emmeka, what are your top 1 to 3 favorite anime?
[18:20:32] <roshen> amigojapan, same to you =) 
[18:20:39] <amigojapan> roshen: emmeka has similar tastes in anime to me
[18:21:00] <roshen> amigojapan, what are yours?
[18:21:00] <emmeka> I'm not sure I could adequately pick a favourite
[18:21:14] <roshen> emmeka, can pick up to 3, or even 4
[18:21:16] * enyc meows
[18:21:33] <zoidberg> picking even 3 fav is tough
[18:21:35] <roshen> or just a random few that you liked a lot
[18:21:43] <roshen> 5?
[18:21:55] <emmeka> yeah, nah. I'm not sure I could pick a specific list of anime that I think rank above all others.
[18:22:13] <roshen> what about the worst anime you ever saw?
[18:22:24] <roshen> would that be equally difficult?
[18:22:25] <amigojapan> roshen: my nostalgic favourite is sailor moon. My classic favourite is Eva and my modern favourite is probably haruhi
[18:22:52] <emmeka> I'm not sure Haruhi counts as a modern anime at this point :P
[18:23:07] <amigojapan> True emmeka 
[18:23:09] <roshen> amigojapan, i haven't seen any of those tbh
[18:23:22] <zoidberg> FMAB, cowboy bebop, legend of galactic heros, trigun, nge, mushishi
[18:23:28] <emmeka> you haven't watched Eva or Haruhi Suzumiya?
[18:23:32] <amigojapan> roshen: oh I hope you check them out
[18:23:38] <roshen> i feel a little hypocritical about giving you all grief for not seeing gantz now lol
[18:23:40] <zoidberg> woah
[18:24:05] <zoidberg> I like gantz but that ending seriously
[18:24:10] <roshen> emmeka, tbh haven't even heard of them
[18:24:18] <emmeka> that's uh
[18:24:27] <roshen> zoidberg, green onions are enough for me
[18:24:36] <amigojapan> roshen: they are all from the past
[18:24:38] <roshen> - my favorite line
[18:24:40] <emmeka> ok. well Eva is basically considered the progenitor of all modern anime and is one of the most popular anime series of all time.
[18:25:20] <zoidberg> there are some pretty good anime these days honestly
[18:25:24] <amigojapan> roshen: Eva is evangelion
[18:25:24] <zoidberg> like my aotw

[18:25:36] <roshen> amigojapan, oh okay
[18:26:28] <emmeka> Haruhi is a KyoAni series, probably their most well known

[18:28:25] <emmeka> amigojapan a life protip: if a series was released on laserdisc, it is no longer modern :P
[18:28:32] <roshen> it feels very authentically and traditionally japanese
[18:28:37] <Cryowolf> so you're trying to recommend something to watch?
[18:28:39] <Cryowolf> or read
[18:28:43] <roshen> yes

[18:28:54] <Cryowolf> I have plenty of things on that end but thank you

[18:29:23] <emmeka> roshen instead of "favourites", I could pick the anime that had the biggest impacts on me.
[18:29:36] <amigojapan> emmeka: laser disc are nice and shinny tho
[18:29:53] <roshen> that works emmeka 
[18:30:11] <Cryowolf> emmeka, I signed up on Wattpad, gonna post it there once it's done.  Among other places
[18:30:15] <Cryowolf> the more places the better
[18:30:54] <emmeka> I'd say maybe Clannad Afterstory, A Place Further than the Universe, Tsuki ga Kirei, Made in Abyss, Madoka Magica and Spice and Wolf. Off the top of my head in no particular order.
[18:30:54] <amigojapan> roshen: sailor moon definitely had the most impact in my life, if it were not for that I would not be 19 years in Japan
[18:31:16] <JesseDesu> ok i mapped my new wacom tablet to one monitor after googling 40 pages of ubuntu commands
[18:31:20] <emmeka> 86, currently airing, has been pretty impactful for me too.

[19:46:22] <JesseDesu> is it #
[19:46:26] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yes
[19:46:50] <JesseDesu> why is  #!/bin/bash commented
[19:46:54] <JesseDesu> on the first line
[19:47:01] <Snake`s_Ghost> Its a special comment
[19:47:04] <JesseDesu> is it supposed to do something 
[19:47:23] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yeah it tells your shell which shell to use
[19:47:30] <JesseDesu> thats what i thought
[19:47:37] <emmeka> don't ask me. it's just the magic words you put into something to make it a shell script.
[19:47:41] <JesseDesu> but why is comment on the first line 
[19:47:52] <JesseDesu> THAT MAKES NO SENSE
[19:48:13] <Snake`s_Ghost> What line do you think it should be on?
[19:48:28] <JesseDesu> shouldnt the magic words be something like
[19:48:31] <JesseDesu> use bash
[19:48:41] <JesseDesu> fuckers had to fuck with us or something
[19:48:55] <Snake`s_Ghost> Much ado about nothing if you ask me xD
[19:49:07] <JesseDesu> i mean, wouldnt that make a lot more sense
[19:49:12] <Snake`s_Ghost> No
[19:49:42] <JesseDesu> if that doesnt make more sense i dont know what does
[19:49:55] <emmeka> but then my shell scripts wouldn't look as incomprehensible to my wife and make her think I'm way more skilled than I actually am
[19:50:08] <amigojapan> Good night everyone

[19:52:15] <JesseDesu> i am stupid
[19:52:17] <Snake`s_Ghost> Its a hash bang
[19:52:30] <JesseDesu> i should stick with art
[19:52:40] <JesseDesu> leave the programming to smarter people
[19:52:43] <emmeka> JesseDesu idk man. if I can do it anyone can.
[19:53:02] <Snake`s_Ghost> It’s easy to come up with a pie in the sky idea, especially before you understand what is already there
[19:53:15] <Snake`s_Ghost> But you need to show your work
[19:53:30] <Snake`s_Ghost> And make your case
[19:53:38] <zoidberg> art is much hard
[19:53:41] <emmeka> shell scripts only basically require that you know the magic words and know your way around a terminal
[19:53:48] <zoidberg> any idiot can learn programming
[19:53:51] <Snake`s_Ghost> Just saying “i like it this way better” is something everyone can say
[19:54:24] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yeah art is hard in its own way
[19:54:41] <zoidberg> I did somewhat amateur programming so if I can do it, anyone can.
[19:54:50] <zoidberg> because I am basic af
[19:55:04] <Snake`s_Ghost> Zoidberg: your just being flattering
[19:55:23] <Snake`s_Ghost> There’s more to good software than saving a program
[19:56:09] <zoidberg> I know myself very well.
[19:56:15] <JesseDesu> i spent an hour googling through 40 pages of ubuntu threads to get the right command for xsetwacom

[20:02:38] <JesseDesu> i mainly use linux for free alternatives and more configuration options
[20:02:49] <JesseDesu> like for video editing, i use openshot
[20:03:11] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yes plus windows watches you draw lolis
[20:03:12] <JesseDesu> and like 5 different text editors
[20:03:18] <Snake`s_Ghost> Judgingly
[20:03:22] <JesseDesu> i bet
[20:03:40] <Snake`s_Ghost> Linux for lolis
[20:03:59] <JesseDesu> also things like free music and video players
[20:04:39] <JesseDesu> i bought a laptop once because it had adobe photoshop cs6
[20:04:59] <JesseDesu> which is the last version before they started using the subscription model
[20:05:11] <isekaijin> lol, buying a laptop because it comes with a program?
[20:05:15] <JesseDesu> but i'm falling out of favor with it

[20:07:50] <isekaijin> No idea about touch gestures, but most drawing tablets work out of the box.
[20:08:06] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yeah iirc my wacom worked OOB

[20:09:26] <isekaijin> Ah, I just use two computers: one with a normal screen, another with the drawing tablet acting as its screen.
[20:09:50] <isekaijin> Why make things unnecessarily complicated?
[20:09:59] <Snake`s_Ghost> I have a diff computer for each program i run
[20:10:01] <JesseDesu> ipad drawing is a totally different experience
[20:10:04] <JesseDesu> its heaven actually
[20:10:17] <isekaijin> Better than a dedicated drawing tablet?
[20:10:19] <Snake`s_Ghost> Just stack them up
[20:10:20] <JesseDesu> you can do things like tap and hold
[20:10:36] <JesseDesu> and it will draw you perfect curves or straight lines
[20:10:45] <isekaijin> The thing that annoys me about mobile devices is that manipulating the file system is extremely annoying.
[20:11:02] <JesseDesu> gen z people dont know what file systems are
[20:11:12] <JesseDesu> they dont need to care

[20:14:16] <Sapphirus> Even the audio production is great
[20:14:18] <JesseDesu> a phone has a basic folder for pictures docs and videos
[20:14:34] <Sapphirus> Download a file manager application and create folders.
[20:14:56] <JesseDesu> not every app recognizes folders created from file managers
[20:15:13] <JesseDesu> like the ipad is totally useless at that
[20:15:33] <Sapphirus> One thing I don't like about CrunchyRoll is they compress the audio, so I always end up having to put my volume up to 110-130%
[20:15:35] <JesseDesu> its recockulous
[20:16:02] <JesseDesu> windows has a tendency to adjust the audio automatically

[20:20:56] <Sapphirus> In fact, there's nothing worse than watching anime in a browser vs.  with MPV.

[20:21:11] <Sapphirus> VLC is awful. 
[20:21:17] <JesseDesu> i love VLC
[20:21:24] <JesseDesu> SORRY BUDDY
[20:21:26] <Snake`s_Ghost> I like vlc

[20:21:51] <JesseDesu> EZ
[20:22:02] <Sapphirus> Well MPV plays anything without a problem.
[20:22:04] <Sapphirus> VLC is just shit. 
[20:22:06] <emmeka> I haven't had VLC crap out in quite a few years
[20:22:15] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yeah same emmeka
[20:22:17] <emmeka> it's substantially better than it used to be
[20:22:21] <JesseDesu> VLC lets you rotate 90 degrees
[20:22:37] <Snake`s_Ghost> Vlc best lc
[20:22:45] <Sapphirus> This was over a few years ago, to be incredibly fair. I don't miss VLC's clunk.
[20:22:52] <Sapphirus> MPV is nice and lightweight -- sub rendering is perfect, too.
[20:23:12] <JesseDesu> MPV lacks an A-B loop button
[20:23:22] <Snake`s_Ghost> Mpv lacks buttons
[20:23:39] <JesseDesu> i have both
[20:23:42] <JesseDesu> dont get me wrong
[20:23:54] <JesseDesu> sometimes i watch 2 things at once
[20:23:56] <Sapphirus> MPV has hotkeys
[20:24:00] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yeah i use mpv if i need to do smth weird
[20:24:06] <JesseDesu> and i need vlc and mpv to do that
[20:24:09] <Snake`s_Ghost> Sapphirus: i hate hotkeys
[20:24:10] <Sapphirus> And a basic player UI, which is all I need.
[20:24:23] <JesseDesu> you need buttons
[20:24:28] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yup
[20:24:29] <emmeka> Sapphirus what you're saying was definitely true like idk 10 years ago, I remember having no end of problems with it at the time
[20:24:35] <JesseDesu> how are you supposed to control a rocket ship without buttons
[20:24:37] <emmeka> but since then things have come a long way
[20:24:44] <emmeka> and it's pretty robust now
[20:24:48] <Snake`s_Ghost> JesseDesu: hotkeys
[20:25:08] <JesseDesu> do you think astronauts use keyboard hotkeys to jettison the lunar module?
[20:25:10] <Sapphirus> I've already settled in with something I like better, emmeka. 
[20:25:21] <JesseDesu> cuz they dont, theres a fucking button for that
[20:25:38] <Snake`s_Ghost> Lets see, retrograde must be r. Nope that was the emergency oxygen supply
[20:25:41] <Sapphirus> I kept VLC around for audio and then switched away from it even for that.
[20:26:20] <Sapphirus> Even if compatibility is better and it's more stable, I still wouldn't switch back.
[20:26:21] <Urchin[emacs]> Snake`s_Ghost: as many as it takes to deliver all the good yuri I find
[20:26:31] <JesseDesu> not only is there a button, theres also a safety cap on it

[21:56:02] <Snake`s_Ghost> I dont like dbz so much. Maybe just the first season is tolerable
[21:56:17] <tcsilver> oh ok
[21:56:20] <tcsilver> did you like super ?
[21:56:33] <tcsilver> I'm guessing not
[21:56:37] <Snake`s_Ghost> Kinda but not really like dragon ball
[21:56:44] <tcsilver> oh ok
[21:56:53] <Snake`s_Ghost> Dragon ball felt like a story
[21:57:00] <tcsilver> exactly :D
[21:57:03] <Snake`s_Ghost> Dbz and beyond is just goku stronk
[21:57:19] <tcsilver> yeah
[21:57:39] <tcsilver> it's the same 10 episodes over and over ;D
[21:57:43] <omero> I think plotline is always important
[21:57:53] <tcsilver> me too omero
[21:58:01] <omero> like reading a good book
[21:58:40] <Snake`s_Ghost> Agreed
[21:58:52] <tcsilver> I agree... I wonder if I should buy 4 manga, 8 books or 2 figurines ... I only have 40 bucks ;D
[21:59:04] <omero> lol
[21:59:10] <tcsilver> lol
[21:59:37] <Snake`s_Ghost> Tcsilver: figurines should be gifts imo
[21:59:48] <Snake`s_Ghost> Collecting them for yourself is a weird flex
[21:59:54] <tcsilver> oooh :-----)
[21:59:56] <omero> I fall into traps at times... too
[22:00:04] <tcsilver> ah
[22:00:11] <Snake`s_Ghost> But im prolly in the minority here
[22:00:20] <tcsilver> I might buy the books :D
[22:00:25] <analoq> Snake`s_Ghost: i find the concept of 'finding pride' in things you buy weird in general
[22:00:32] <omero> but thats when Im really bored :P
[22:00:37] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: I actually don't know about 
[22:00:40] <Snake`s_Ghost> Yeah
[22:00:46] <Snake`s_Ghost> Analoq
[22:01:00] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: Fruits Basket anything other than the title and that it's considered really good
[22:01:23] <analoq> when i see a nice car i think 'the designer did a good job' but his work does not transfer to you just because you bought his design :P
[22:01:37] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: I never got around to reading/watching it
[22:01:44] <JesseDesu> i like figurines
[22:01:57] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: and only recently did I even find out about it, and that was after I mostly stopped watching anime
[22:02:00] <JesseDesu> i blow all my money on them
[22:02:00] <tcsilver> :) me too jessedesu!
[22:02:09] <JesseDesu> within reason
[22:02:10] <tcsilver> I want to buy some g.i. joes lol
[22:02:14] <JesseDesu> after certain things are paid
[22:02:18] <omero> you never played MTG, eh?
[22:02:19] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] oh. it's pretty good. it starts off like a very typical shoujo series, but then takes a turn for the dark and serious.
[22:02:23] <tcsilver> same here
[22:02:51] <Snake`s_Ghost> Analoq: that at least has some utility. But it half applies bc if someone was collecting cars itd be strange but also just buying one or however many you really need is defensable
[22:02:57] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] the original anime has an anime-original ending and while it's a classic, the manga is better. They did a remake of the anime recently that's faithful to the manga, that's what you see on the MAL top 10 list.
[22:03:17] <tcsilver> I might buy manga or G.I. joes oooor some pizza

[22:14:46] <omero> like the one juvia gives gray on that episode of fairy tail :P
[22:14:51] <Snake`s_Ghost> I’d buy an anime girl pillow if i knew where to buy good ones
[22:15:12] <Snake`s_Ghost> The ones that are easy to buy are always drawn somewhat poorly
[22:15:30] <omero> bad bad quality... Snake`s_Ghost 
[22:15:53] <Snake`s_Ghost> Some yeah. Others are just a little bad. You wouldnt notice if it were and original character, but if its a character you know
[22:16:06] <Snake`s_Ghost> And it isnt true to the priginal style
[22:16:10] <Snake`s_Ghost> It will look off
[22:16:45] <omero> I meant... a pillow made for you by someone that cares ;)

[23:57:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: cth: VPNs are mostly useless anyway because corporations are ultimately subordinate to local authorities, and most VPN designs don't make it hard (or anywhere near impossible) to identify the source of a connection from the provider side.
[23:58:08] <cth> exactly
[23:58:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At best it can protect against corposcum identifying you trivially, and bypassing local network filters.
