[09:09:48] <igemnace> can't speak to h3.org's quality of search results yet, but the idea is something that appeals to me

[09:10:26] *** Joins: visl (visl@user/visl)
[09:11:07] <VarunA> if you want to search for good quality article length posts, you can try with the in-depth pages option

For instance i know programming, but know little about hardware and i searched for "electronics" on ht3 i ended up reading for hours, but the same search on google dumps SEO + wikipedia

[09:17:49] <igemnace> but i don't think it's the search engine's fault. i've longed for a take on mobile OSes (e.g. android ROMs) from the perspective of someone already adept at desktop OSes, but i've had a sneaking suspicion that if there's any out there on the web, it'll be exceedingly rare

[09:24:31] <igemnace> like how google sneaks in its corrections: https://i.imgur.com/utVa1qc.png
[09:24:57] <igemnace> people will likely be trained to pay attention to that. less thinking about UX
[09:25:09] <VarunA> igemnace thats a good idea...
[09:26:16] <VarunA> although i find that feature a bit annoying tbh, because it often suggests things i dont mean, specially for programming related things.. my thinking was more power to the user, let the user decide how to search, but i guess subword is not an intuitive enough concept

[09:35:42] <igemnace> btw, you might also want to put an explanation for "searching across word boundaries" on the result page itself. perhaps a tooltip link, e.g. "Learn More". it appears on your homepage, but if someone searches using a saved search engine (e.g. on firefox or vivaldi), that gets bypassed: https://files.emnace.org/Videos/ht3-search-engine.webm
