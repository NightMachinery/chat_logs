[01:08:28] <dskull> Q: I've got a docker container running fine, however i want to change the entrypoint command by removing some "args" that show up under the docker inspect command --- how might I simply remove an arg from there?
[01:08:40] <ada_>  /unjerk what's wrong with using iptables on its own and leaving ufw out of the equation?
[01:08:55] <ada_> like, is that an option you've considered, seeing as ufw is an interface to iptables
[01:09:06] <ada_> dskull: make a new container
[01:09:19] <ada_> dskull: docker run yourimage --entrypoint ...
[01:10:08] <ada_> dskull: there isn't a way to change the CMD or the ENTRYPOINT on a container that already exists; you just have to make a new container with the entrypoint you want instead
[01:10:50] <znf> ada_, if I weren't so lazy, I wouldn't have used docker in the first place :)
[01:10:59] <akik> ada_: you surely know that the de facto way to manage iptables on ubuntu is ufw
[01:11:13] <ada_> I know that it comes installed with ubuntu
[01:11:18] <ada_> I also know you can just not use it ever
[01:11:36] <ada_> iptables has an interface that works just fine and you can add rules to the DOCKER-USER chain
[01:12:00] <ada_> https://docs.docker.com/network/iptables/#add-iptables-policies-before-dockers-rules
[01:12:11] <ada_> I'm not a fan of ufw OR firewalld
[01:12:54] <znf> ufw is simple for most people's needs :)

[03:19:18] <k8yun> newb question here: does container retain changed files inside the container when it gets shutdown and restarted?
[03:19:56] <k8yun> say I create a dummy file using `touch test.txt`, will it be retained after a reboot?

[03:23:09] <tianon> k8yun: depends on how it gets "shutdown and restarted" - if that's "docker restart", "docker stop" + "docker start", then yes; if that's "my pod in k8s died and k8s 'restarted' it" then I believe k8s usually creates a whole new container, so no (you'd need to provide a persistent volume or mount of some kind to keep files between runs in that case)
[03:23:47] <tianon> k8yun: if it's data you actually care about saving long term, you definitely want to look into saving it into a volume or mount of some kind external to the container

[03:25:15] <k8yun> ok, thanks for the clarifications
[03:25:24] <tianon> zen_coder, wez: I don't think "privileged" will help as the error is a permissions error on the socket -- I'd suggest checking the gid of the socket (something like `stat --format '%g' /var/run/docker.sock`) and then using --group-add on your container to add that group to the set of groups the container runs with so it has access to the mounted socket (although keep in mind that access to the
[03:25:25] <tianon> mounted socket makes it trivial to get direct access to the host, so use with extreme caution, especially with untrusted software)

[15:10:44] <tabakhase> i´d go as far and say if possible, consider moving, or maybe spliting or whatever to a bit more "uniform" system where the docker support isnt just tacked on 3-plugins-deep :/

[18:30:30] <aminvakil> this sounds stupid, but if a docker has configured with a remote logging driver and the remote logging process (loki in this case) gets shut down, docker containers stops working?
[18:31:24] <aminvakil> we had a 30 minute maintenance time for our monitoring infrastructure (including loki) and it seems that during this time our docker swarm instance which used loki for logging could not respond
[18:31:41] <aminvakil> as we didn't have monitoring and our containers wanted to log in loki, we don't have any log :)

[19:20:53] <k8yun> can you have containers to join network after it's been created?
[19:23:33] <k8yun> so `docker network create <myNW>` happens after `docker run ... --name myContainer`, and I would like myContainer to join myNW.
