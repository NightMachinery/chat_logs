[00:42:44] <headius> recent ostruct failures are addressed in https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/7162
[00:43:24] <headius> there are three failures for 9.3.4 on ostruct tests; two are an ostruct bug (https://github.com/ruby/ostruct/pull/45) and the other should be fixed in the PR above (omit native method_missing from backtraces)
[00:44:01] <headius> assuming that m_m change is ok this will green up test:mri:stdlib on 9.3
