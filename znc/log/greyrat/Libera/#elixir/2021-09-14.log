[00:54:05] <rawtaz> whk: what about the mere fact that it runs on the erlang vm? [D:)
[00:54:11] <rawtaz> i guess thats a quite small point :<
[00:56:27] <Ankhers> Is there a reason I am unable to use "#{pid}", but I can use "#{inspect pid}"?
[00:57:20] <whk> rawtaz: i think that is cool, great point. erlang also runs on the erlang vm, so not sure if that is different in elixir.
[00:58:10] <benwilson512> Ankhers: yes, "#{pid}" is the same as `to_string(pid)` which uses the String.Chars protocol
[00:58:18] <benwilson512> and that is only implemented by default for data structures that are used to represent text
[00:58:30] <Ankhers> benwilson512: That seems fair. Thanks!
[00:58:35] <benwilson512> whereas `inspect` is implemented for most data structures by default to produce a debugging representation
[00:58:51] <rawtaz> whk: for me as a non-erlang programmer, i liked that there came a new language that was arguably more approachable/easier to learn that still used the great erlang vm. im not sure that tickles your fellow erlangers though, but thats IMO some value for a lot of people.

[02:13:34] <creature> In a Rails project, I can use RSpec/Capybara to implement some "end-to-end" tests, or "feature" tests. Stuff that drives a web browser: "Navigate to this URL, click this button. 'Foo' should be displayed/'Bar' should now be true on the backend", etc. Is there a similar common tool in the Elixir/Phoenix world?

[02:31:54] <benwilson512> if you're doing liveview, it comes with its own front end test helpers (also much fast, since no need to drive the headless browser)

[03:17:07] <ytriosa> Hello, I'm a beginner in the language you tell me which framework to develop for the web in the elixir? 
[03:17:22] <benwilson512> hi ytriosa you should use Phoenix.
[03:19:42] <ytriosa> I understand, is his documentation good?, Has a link of the documentation?, Please. 
[03:20:10] <benwilson512> ytriosa: yes the phoenix documentation is very good and there is also a book. however if you are new to the language I highly recommend making sure that you spend time learning the Elixir language itself first
[03:20:21] <ytriosa> I develop in other language but the Elixir is new to me. 
[03:20:28] <benwilson512> another functional programming language?
[03:21:05] <ytriosa> No, non-functional language but I've already discovered Haskell. 
[03:21:16] <ytriosa> Javascript, Ruby, python ...
[03:21:22] <benwilson512> I would definitely find material to learn the basics of Elixir first
[03:21:36] <benwilson512> and then look at web development / Phoenix after you are comfortable with Elixir fundamentals
[03:23:39] <ytriosa> Understand. 
[03:24:06] <ytriosa> Do I know Elixir School is a good place to start? 
[03:24:09] <ytriosa> https://elixirschool.com/en/
[03:26:20] <benwilson512> I know a lot of people use it, I have not used it myself

[10:20:42] <Nicd> so it turns out ContEx doesn't do diffing so every update of the graph transfers the whole SVG to the client

[18:11:22] <dch> creature: don't forget the value of a well-placed IO.inspect/2 
[18:12:05] <dch> I assume that the template is still a compiled function, even in the liveview, so I would expect it to need to be passed through explicitly.
[18:13:54] <uhoreg> How can I find all the modules that are under an atom?  e.g. if I have modules Foo.Bar and Foo.Baz, and I'm given Foo, then how do I find Foo.Bar and Foo.Baz?
[18:14:48] <benwilson512> uhoreg: there is no explicit namespacing in Elixir, the use of `.` to denote namespaces is merely conventional
[18:15:03] <benwilson512> or rather no explicit namespace nesting
[18:15:13] <benwilson512> short answer: you can't, what are you trying to do?
[18:15:51] <creature> dch: I am not sure what I would IO.inspect in this case! (I scattered some <%= @session %> guesses into my template, and the Phoenix error page showed my data in the session along with the assigns. So I knew it wasn't explicitly assigned automatically - but no more than that.)
[18:17:25] <uhoreg> I'm trying to build a list of modules, and I'm wondering if there's a better way than listing them all by hand, e.g. using wildcards.  I figure there must be something that can be done since I can do tab completion in iex.
[18:17:43] <dch> uhoreg: `for i <- 0..:erlang.system_info(:atom_count)-1, do: :erlang.binary_to_term(<<131,75,i::24>>)` should list all registered atoms
[18:18:01] <benwilson512> lol
[18:19:26] <dch> uhoreg: but if you just want to list all *loaded* modules, there should be an easier way to do that. I'm afk now, but look under Code.*  Module.* or Application.* and see if there's something that already does it
[18:19:47] <dch> I just can't recall it off the top of my head while I waltz out the door
[18:20:13] <uhoreg> Thanks.  I already looked under Module and didn't see anything.  I'll check Code and Application.
[18:20:17] <dch> creature: yep thats all I would have done, too. You can look at the source code and see whats done in the (presumably) macro..
[18:20:52] <dch> aaah
[18:21:06] <dch> uhoreg: `:code.all_loaded()` is the erlang equivalent.
[18:22:25] <uhoreg> Ah, nice.  I can work with the erlang version.

[20:07:12] <phaleth> ytriosa: maybe cause another list has already been formed

[20:09:33] <OMGOMG> ## Examples
[20:09:33] <OMGOMG>     iex> Enum.chunk_by([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7], &(rem(&1, 2) == 1))
[20:09:33] <OMGOMG>     [[1], [2, 2], [3], [4, 4, 6], [7, 7]]
[20:09:41] <OMGOMG> seems straightforward enough
[20:15:28] <ytriosa> Does it create the groups dynamically according to the size of the string and will include the subsequent string in it? 
[20:16:41] <rawtaz> ytriosa: for good measure you should use the same capitalization on all places for your variable :)
[20:16:50] <rawtaz> and its fn not FN
[20:16:56] <rawtaz> and its End not end
[20:16:57] <rawtaz> etc
[20:17:00] <rawtaz> err end not END :D
[20:17:05] <rawtaz> nor End 
[20:18:06] <rawtaz> ffs i cant get anything right today. i meant phaleth
[20:18:20] <rawtaz> that chunk_by function is pretty cool, i didnt know about it
[20:18:42] <rawtaz> browsing `h` in iex is one of the best things to spend time with i think. or the docs, whatever
[20:18:51] <phaleth> I copied ytriosa's code
[20:19:13] <rawtaz> true
[20:19:15] <phaleth> didn't know about chunk_by either
[20:21:05] <rawtaz> Stream.* is really nice too, that along with Enum.*
[20:22:00] <phaleth> I guess they just need to sort the list by length of each string then it'll work fine, but there is always one way to find out
[20:22:12] <phaleth> afk for an hour or two
[20:24:28] <josevalim> ytriosa: there is also Enum.group_by
[20:29:09] <ytriosa> I'm going to take a look at it 
[20:31:18] <ytriosa> In Elixir a string of characters is treated as an enumerable? 
[20:38:57] <OMGOMG> it's even worse, an enumerable may be treated as a string of characters
[20:39:09] <ytriosa> Elixir pipe operator is very good
[20:39:11] <ytriosa> Let it leaves the act of working with several calls of functions much more legible. I really liked it. 
[20:40:22] <Nicd> ytriosa: Elixir strings are UTF-8 encoded binaries
[20:41:27] <Nicd> there are also charlists which are Erlang strings, and are lists of integers corresponding to Unicode codepoints. charlists are shown as strings with single quotes, Elixir strings have double quotes
[20:46:16] <ytriosa> I just saw it now little I found strange looks like a string.

[22:45:21] <mekhami> what happens to the state of an OTP process when it hibernates?
[22:51:51] <josevalim> mekhami: it is GCed and compacted to reduce fragmentation and then kept nicely in memory
[22:58:36] <mekhami> thanks. i'm trying to figure out whether i should have a pool of available workers pulling things off of SQS and processing data, or just dynamically allocate a worker for each message
[23:00:30] <mekhami> the processes will be long running (sometimes) but can hibernate in between 'steps', generally hibernating 99% of the time they are alive
[23:00:43] <mekhami> as long as i can do that and not be too too concerned over memory usage, i'd prefer that to trying to pool and queue
[23:02:00] <rawtaz> having separate workers processing data off a queue seems more decoupled to me
[23:02:24] <rawtaz> but if you dont need that in your architecture right now, then heck, keep it simple :)
[23:02:24] <mekhami> well to be clear; i have an sqs queue, broadway's pulling them off and creating an OTP process for each of the SQS messages
[23:11:39] <mekhami> i don't really understand broadway's backpressure
[23:11:43] <mekhami> or genstage's, i suppose
[23:11:55] <mekhami> how will it know to stop pulling things off of the sqs queue

[23:22:02] <mekhami> i'm still not even fully confident i need broadway here
[23:22:17] <mekhami> i just want to pull things off the queue; other than acking back, that's the end of the pipeline, really.
[23:33:47] <josevalim> mekhami: if you have a queue with 10000 items, it won't pull all 10000 at once
[23:33:59] <josevalim> it will pull based on how much capacity you have locally, that's it in a nutshell
[23:34:09] <josevalim> you need to ack them though, otherwise next time you connect to sqs they will be consumed again

[23:42:33] <mekhami> josevalim: how is the local capacity defined? is that from the configuration or does it do smart things like throttling when system memory is low?
