[03:48:12] <entuland> hoppity, beware - having a commonly available default as a starting point is a double-edged sword, just like you have access to it, many others have, and unless you override / alter / tweak such defaults, a big part of your resulting product may give the "cookie cutter" taste to users that happen to have stumbled on other sites using the same defaults
[03:48:15] <hoppity> hassoon, haha thank you
[03:48:51] <entuland> assuming you care, that is - you may be happy with keeping most of those defaults
[03:48:51] <hoppity> entuland, that is 100% true, I am building a business app though (internal staff only) so it is not too much of a concern
[03:48:55] *** Quits: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:49:29] <entuland> oh that's good, you normally don't have to worry about that cookie-cutter taste there and it may actually be beneficial to use something users are familiar with from other places
[03:49:30] <hassoon> seems more like a dedicated web app, than a traditional website
[03:49:42] <hassoon> you using a framework ?
[03:49:50] <hassoon> or vailla js ?
[03:49:55] <hassoon> * vanilla *
[03:50:17] <hoppity> hassoon, I am using Alpine JS and Tailwind CSS
[03:50:39] <hoppity> hassoon, and the Phoenix Framework for my server side
[03:51:21] <hassoon> okey
[03:52:05] <entuland> uhm... if you are using all of that already, you may be better looking into themes from those instead of adding a separated additional dependency
[03:52:26] <entuland> just the first hit I found googling: https://dev.to/mariann93502220/15-awesome-tailwind-css-templates-and-themes-55jh
[03:54:32] <hoppity> entuland, that's true too, the only reason I hesitate to install a theme is that I want to keem my complexity as low as possible. I already spent a lot of time getting the web app to look good on all devices and don't want to start again with a theme. In the past I would use themes the old way -clone their code and replace internal parts with my own- but now theme installation seems to be exactly that, an installation of sorts involving npm, webpack etc and
[03:54:32] <hoppity> I don't know if I am ready to make the jump.
[03:55:14] <entuland> installing an additional framework is going to be more work than just a theme
[03:55:21] <hoppity> Unless you think I am completely over reaction and I just just go with a theme haha
[03:55:54] <entuland> if you don't want to tweak a theme that is supposed to cooperate perfectly with the framework it's designed for, you'll be probably better just customizing your existing defaults with some CSS
[03:56:42] <hoppity> entuland, I guess I don't fully grasp what a theme is. I think of a theme as someone who already made some pages with nice styling and then you kinda just take over those pages and replace their content with your own. Is this not correct?
[03:56:57] <entuland> no, that's not a theme for me
[03:57:13] <entuland> the theme should only take care of styling the various elements and widgets
[03:57:27] <entuland> but there are some parts of this which are debated and are context dependent
[03:57:34] <hoppity> makes sense
[03:57:46] <entuland> for instance, on Drupal a theme may come with a lot of templates which affect the way a page is laid out
[03:58:03] <entuland> in this context, I refer to "theme" as just the CSS styling, mainly
[03:58:21] <entuland> not knowing those themes in particular (the tailwind ones) I can't tell
[03:58:27] <entuland> so you may need to do some investigation
[03:58:46] <hoppity> I will give it a shot tonight and report my results back tomorrow
[03:58:58] <hoppity> that way everyone can learn a little bit about Tailwinds, me included
[03:59:06] <entuland> sounds good
[03:59:16] <hoppity> thanks for your help, I gotta run to Costco with the wife
[03:59:22] <hoppity> talk tomorrow
[04:00:16] <entuland> enjoy!

[12:43:30] <FunkyBob> kristijonas: I am familiar with image formats
[12:43:51] <FunkyBob> what iamge format did you use for the qr code before embedding it in the PDF?
[12:44:47] <kristijonas> FunkyBob, I didn't use, that was generated by someone else, when I extract it it is in png: https://pasteboard.co/K8diifG.png
[12:45:19] <FunkyBob> yikes, that's a lot of data in your qrcode
[12:45:22] <AMcBain> FunkyBob, try this? https://jsfiddle.net/n6x3hvwb/
[12:45:27] * FunkyBob remembers... no ::after on img
[12:45:45] <AMcBain> Yeah, but ::after kinda depends. Replaced content elements are weird.
[12:45:59] <AMcBain> I think you can get a ::before/::after on some input elements in Chromium?
[12:46:10] <AMcBain> I wish they hadn't since the spec doesn't define what that is, but whatever.
[12:47:17] <FunkyBob> https://jsfiddle.net/pgb732h0/1/
[12:48:17] <AMcBain> Yeah that works too. I made the image block because it removes the gap below it in the parent.
[12:48:38] <AMcBain> Which really only matters if stuff is going to sit below the parent or if you wanted the overlay to have a background.
[12:48:44] <AMcBain> If you don't, then that doesn't matter.

[23:42:22] <hoppity> I want to say that I did not have a chance to test installing a TailwindCSS theme yet since today was my daughter's birthday and I spent all evening yesterday at Costco buying things for the party. I will probably get to this on Saturday and report back then.
[23:44:41] <matsaman> happy daughter's birthday
[23:44:44] <matsaman> tailwind blows chunks
