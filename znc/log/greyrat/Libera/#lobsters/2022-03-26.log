[00:01:30] <amazigh> is it secret project? does it relates to bass?

[00:03:17] <amazigh> bass is unrelated to nix sofar, but I like the idea they use a programming language (albeit still experimental) unlike other tools that claim to be declarative dsls

[00:04:40] <amazigh> maybe low-fidelity is related to lisp. bass comes from kernel that departs from scheme that is itself a lisp but very unlike the most well known: common lisp.
[00:09:03] <amazigh> drakonis: what language host your automation framework? IIUC it is the missing piece in nix and guix?
[00:09:25] <amazigh> maybe the first question is not interesting.
[00:09:38] <amazigh> I was wondering why vito is using go.
[00:09:38] <drakonis> raku
[00:11:18] <drakonis> it's the philosophy and design that motivates that
[00:11:52] <amazigh> maybe you already wrote all that stuff somewhere? it will help the convo if you have it.
[00:12:03] <amazigh> if you don't that is fine.
[00:12:27] <amazigh> myself I write a lot trying to explain what I want to do, and barely code it. I guess the inverse situation is also common.
[00:12:29] <drakonis> ha, i dont yet
[00:12:36] <drakonis> but i should write it down
[00:13:33] <amazigh> reminds me of a story I read, IIRC, it is a famous mathematicians (that is they achieved quiet some stuff), but they also had a very grand imagination
[00:13:52] <amazigh> what they imagined is not yet achieved.
[00:14:12] <amazigh> we are barely touching approaching their idea. Too bad my memory is fuzzy ;)
[00:14:19] <amazigh> it is NOT AGI :)

[00:36:28] <vito> the low-fidelity thing is a bit of a stretch, it's supposed to be a play on 'bass' (i.e. the limited range of sound) + relay that it's not a general-purpose language, it's more for glue code where you don't need a big expansive set of libraries for every little thing (i.e. high fidelity work)
[00:36:43] <vito> since 99% of what you're doing with it is running the actual commands that "do the thing"

[12:23:03] <Witcher007> Hi anyone worked TCP IP servers? I'm building one with C#, .NETCORE with async all the way. Wanted to know what would be best practices to host application such as TCP server on Ubuntu/Linux? Also what gotcha might be there which are not apparent?

[12:44:35] <calculated> Only thing you've got to be careful with are the TCP streams themselves imo. I've done a basic server in C# but it was a long time ago so I can't really give you any details. As for hosting I have no idea how to go about that maybe someone more experienced in this can give their suggestions
[12:46:26] <calculated> Here's a nice github repo which may help you https://github.com/jchristn/SuperSimpleTcp

[13:08:01] <kline> Witcher007, tcp streams work pretty much the same everywhere
[13:08:31] <kline> if you get weird 40ms latency issues then look at nagles algorithm, but you shouldnt turn it off unless you have a measurable issue

[20:42:02] <Guest3743> How download whole linux, for using offline without internet.
[20:42:21] <amazigh> That is the purpose of a livecd
[20:42:25] <Guest3743> All packages, pip, gem , rust package, latex package, all source code etc
[20:42:27] <amazigh> or liveusb
[20:42:32] <amazigh> ahah
[20:42:36] <amazigh> good one :)
[20:42:53] <Guest3743> I live in Poland, near me is war

[20:43:18] <Guest3743> many people don have good internet, russia and chinese blocking internet
[20:43:49] <Guest3743> I need instal and using linux, can You put this question to lobsters?
[20:44:03] <amazigh> There is no way to download the whole internet, even only all the program that exists.
[20:44:45] <amazigh> I will think about it. Stay around here, someone else will chime in.
[20:44:48] <amazigh> Guest3743: ^
[20:44:48] <Guest3743> I no need all programs, I need distribution fedora, debian, ubuntu etc.
[20:45:19] <Guest3743> and all gem ruby, pip python etc. (and meybe stackoverflow;-)  )
[20:45:44] <amazigh> there https://kiwix.org that aims to make available offline wikipedia and stackoverflow

[20:46:35] <amazigh> Mirroring distro is documented, and possible. Mirroring example pypi prolly possible. I do not know about npmjs et ruby gems
[20:48:12] <amazigh> I used to entertain the idea of a 'system' that is sustainable like you describe, something that you could put on disk, possibly large, and then you could sustain the development, and living a community.
[20:50:26] <Guest3743> Please send  my question to Lobsters. I do not have an account
[20:50:40] <amazigh> My conclusion is that the current system and systems are too fragmented, in order to create somekind of zip of some sort with all the necessary tooling (software, documentation, ...)

[21:27:15] <mocx> Then you have to alias every command to a container
[21:27:41] <Ticho> I am running a few cli tools that way, due to some incompatible dependencies they have

[21:37:29] <mocx> I feel like docker is the “cool” version of lxc though is why.
[21:38:44] <mocx> I just find docker extremely problematic is why I use podman. Nothing to do with cool new tech.

[21:47:38] <drakonis> c355E3B: what's your take on automation/deployment software?
[21:48:19] <c355E3B>  Most of its crap, the "real" space for automation/deployment is translating business processes into something that can get into the cloud.
[21:48:33] <c355E3B> we are doing what we pay SAP to do to ourselves
[21:50:23] <drakonis> that sounds really bad
[21:50:27] <drakonis> how can that be improved?
[21:51:05] <drakonis> i feel like infrastructure as code is a lie
[21:52:07] <c355E3B> IMO "infrastructure as code" is really just change management under a different name.
[21:52:38] <c355E3B> I feel like if you want to change the landscape, you need to have some kind of stakeholder managment system.
[21:54:09] <jle> surfing with firefox, coding with vscode, chatting in slack: STOP WASTING RESOURCES WITH "cat | grep" !
[21:54:19] <drakonis> lol
[21:54:22] <drakonis> wtf
[21:54:32] <drakonis> what would a stakeholder management system even entail
[21:54:41] <drakonis> it seems like something that exists to parlay with corporate
[21:54:49] <c355E3B> Yes!
[21:54:50] <gwozniak> jle: indeed
[21:54:52] <c355E3B> But that's what you need.
[21:55:39] <c355E3B> The past three months have been me spending a massive amount of time having to juggle "why?" across 90+ teams.
[21:56:08] <gwozniak> jle: it's like playing code golf in a giant web app with 1000+ dependencies
[21:56:19] <drakonis> jfc
[21:56:29] <c355E3B> So, how can you solve this?
[21:56:35] <c355E3B> Vomit some form of automation onto it.
[21:56:48] <mocx> Agree on the stakeholder management system. We spent the last year getting rid of in house dependencies for our software and combining that with things like helm charts and kubes we find we’re involving 5+ people to solve a simple problem.
[21:57:27] <mocx> The main problem being now that a large portion of our systems are hidden behind magic and people with know-how
[21:57:29] <gwozniak> This is what I worry about with the idea at work that we will move everything to AWS for build/test
[21:57:36] <c355E3B> Also I'm now in a "staff" position, and I'm having to work 4am to 6pm because of people not fucking talking to people.
[21:58:18] <c355E3B> Tickets/Kanban doesn't work because it does not understand the external dependencies that exist outside of non-kanban processes.
[21:58:32] <c355E3B> Scrum is an actual death marth
[21:58:42] <c355E3B> Waterfall can't work with SaaS software
[21:58:47] <c355E3B> there clearly is something else
[21:58:50] <mocx> They moved our container images to ECR and now you have to go through a special auth process that you have to set up.
[21:58:54] <c355E3B> but fuck if I know how to articulate
[21:59:05] <mocx> What is the point of internal SSO then?
[21:59:25] <drakonis> ugh, that's a shitload of bullshit tacked on because its the average practice
[21:59:28] <c355E3B> mocx: you have bad AWS admins then. If they did it right, your SSO platform authenticates you into everything.
[21:59:48] <mocx> Yeah
[22:00:16] <mocx> If you make the switch to more magic, make sure you have a 1 line install migration process
[22:00:17] <c355E3B> for my stuff, you run `tsh login` and you have access to all of our cloud resources.
[22:00:32] <mocx> And/or setup process
[22:00:50] <drakonis> lol
[22:00:56] <drakonis> if i have to make something better, i want less magic
[22:00:59] <drakonis> and more control
[22:01:28] <mocx> Its things like: install awscli, run this command, find the in browser cli option, generate auth certs,…
[22:01:49] <mocx> Like sure theres a script for this guide you spent so much time on?
[22:02:14] <mocx> drakonis: yep, i always push for writing the code yourself
[22:02:49] <mocx> If its a simple solution then fine, it doesnt have to work forever or be super configurable and fancy, we just need momentum
[22:03:01] <mocx> Dont make every problem a project
[22:03:11] <mocx> Dont make ever convenience a project
[22:03:23] <mocx> every*
[22:05:08] <drakonis> have a reasonable simple baseline and have as much code moved into execution steps
[22:05:42] <drakonis> like "encrypt files" then "connect with ssh and run the commands inside the context"
[22:06:05] <drakonis> also fuck dsls, god.
[22:07:13] <drakonis> its cool on paper to have those but in the long run it only makes it worse
[22:07:55] <mocx> Right, fuck pretty code, just make sure you can read it. Don’t be clever, let the compiler figure that out. Readable, readable, readable. Because docblocks aren’t enough.
[22:09:52] <drakonis> its less the pretty code and more that the dsls always end requiring some kind of weird way to structure your code
[22:11:43] <gwozniak> I've kind of changed my view on DSLs in the last decade.  If they are to be used, it must be in limited circumstances
[22:12:16] <gwozniak> And probably not be Turing complete
[22:12:56] <drakonis> if there are dsls, dont make them the primary way to interact
[22:13:11] <drakonis> it will inevitably require escape hatches
[22:14:25] <mocx> Yes
[22:16:02] <mocx> I think this will be the case for our masking system, currently regexs, but needs a plugin system.
[22:16:18] <drakonis> masking system?
[22:16:57] <drakonis> what are you developing?
[22:17:32] <mocx> An integration testing framework
[22:18:15] <mocx> With junior devs who have been promoted to 3s but need some fixing in the corners, imo
[22:19:09] <drakonis> i see
[22:19:16] <mocx> complete with proxy wrapper
[22:19:44] <mocx> That must be deployed separately because the application is a big fat hog
[22:19:59] <mocx> And so is cypress
[22:20:26] <mocx> And the logs for the deployed containers are down a well
[22:21:29] <mocx> of internal access configs and kubernetes logging limits
[22:21:42] <mocx> Thankfully we have sumo for some of it
[22:22:47] <drakonis> i'm thinking about plugin systems but uh
[22:22:58] <drakonis> most plugin systems serve to include behavior, not replace
[22:23:41] <mocx> Sure
[22:24:09] <drakonis> for my own kind of work, i'm generally aiming for an approach that gets around that
[22:24:23] <mocx> Right now we’re doing string replacement for an auth token with regexes
[22:25:00] <drakonis> lol

[22:25:15] <drakonis> which language are you using?
[22:25:35] <mocx> Im rubber ducking that maybe I need to generate the creds myself to get by it. So it would require passing a function. Which means importing a code file.
[22:25:45] <mocx> JS
[22:26:19] <drakonis> i see
[22:28:00] <mocx> Fun
[22:28:16] <drakonis> indeed
[22:29:35] <drakonis> i wonder why though
[22:29:47] <drakonis> but well, i'm using raku
[22:30:05] <mocx> It’s been a journey but I guess to circle back to stakeholder system is that we’ve needed to interact with these people anyways, why not approach the projects that way if all the logic is going to be locked away behind kubes or aws or nextjs?
[22:31:37] <drakonis> hextjs?
[22:31:50] <drakonis> oh
[22:31:52] <drakonis> nextjs
[22:32:23] <mocx> hex- might be more accurate
