[01:19:49] <sebboh> rpav, hm?  I have a paid account on sr.ht.  I don't, you know, use it for the primary purpose or anything..  I just liked them a lot so I set up a recurring donation in the form of a paid account.  I *do* use the IRC client/bnc service they set up.  Love it.

[01:22:01] <bpalmer> rpav: what's the very easy step?
[01:22:18] <technomancy> the most infuriating thing for me that github does is when they add their stupid "markdown helpers" and bind it to C-b for a feature that does nothing but put two asterisks in your textarea
[01:22:31] <technomancy> at least, that used to bug me before I switched to exwm and now github has no idea when I press C-b
[01:23:00] <rpav> bpalmer: oh, from "consumer-friendly" to "anti-consumer" .. and a much harder step back from "dependent-on-now-monopolistic-service" to "something else that probably isn't very good anymore"

[02:10:49] <bpalmer> sebboh: whenever you look at something's update date, consider: why would this package be updated? Was it lacking features? Does it need tight integration with something else that's fast moving?

[02:12:09] <mfiano> I like smartparens because it has better integration with other packages, such as evil-cleverparens and it is what the monolithic configs like Doom and Spacemacs use, so it gets more users = bugs fixed.

[04:16:03] <lemacs_zzz> with multiple-cursors.el, is there a way to add a new cursor by calling a function or using a keybind? there's the mc/add-cursor-on-click, but when I try to run it from M-x I get the message that it should be bound to an event with paramters
[04:18:23] <bpalmer> mc/mark-next-like-this with no region selected just adds a new cursor on the next line
[04:18:58] <bpalmer> mc/mark-pop sets a cursor at point and then takes you to the next spot on the mark-ring
[04:20:24] <lemacs_zzz> the mc/mark-pop seems to be closer of what I want, I want to set multiple points in different columns
[04:20:30] <lemacs_zzz> how can I clear the mark-ring?
[04:21:18] <bpalmer>  M-: (setq mark-ring nil global-mark-ring nil) , technically. (I don't know if mc is using the local or global mark ring)

[04:30:00] <shrysr> technomancy: fwiw .. the main reason i was able to move to 'working knowledge' of git is magit. i'm a mech engg somewhat recently turned 'dev' (or whatever)... and I was using emacs (org mode) before that. I believe all the 'crap' i ended up learning by tinkering with Emacs significantly helped in dealing with the considerable technical debt that i have to somehow cross in this lifetime.
[04:30:57] <technomancy> shrysr: yeah I would have switched off git a long time ago if it weren't for magit. it protects you from the worst parts of git

[09:10:45] <zebrag> So I've got a very convoluted org-file, containing a lengthy `find | grep` command producing the output in an `example-bloc`. Since the grep is related to org-files, I wish I knew how to easily jump to the org-file from which the matched expression is coming from. So I could modify the original file then re-run the `find | grep`. And so on. All the point is me trying to find and understand something I've wrote before.
[09:10:49] <corwin> rudybot: seen johnw
[09:10:49] <rudybot> corwin: johnw was seen joining in #emacs five weeks ago, and then johnw was seen quitting four weeks ago, saying "Ping timeout: 250 seconds"
[09:11:50] <bpalmer> zebrag: so the find | grep   output is a list of files, and you just want them to be hyperlinks?
[09:12:12] <zebrag> no it's the lines themselves
[09:12:25] <zebrag> it's already the excerpt from the matching files

[09:13:37] <zebrag> no
[09:14:02] <bpalmer> that's the usual way I deal with that sort of thing, where it's filename:some text
[09:14:43] <zebrag> but I don't have the name of the file, not really
[09:15:06] <zebrag> since I've got a `find` producing a long list of files
[09:15:13] <bpalmer> that's where I was searching for clarity. If grep accepts multiple arguments to search among, it will prefix its matches with the filename.
[09:15:34] <bpalmer> so pass it to xargs and ensure it always has at least one extra argument, the /dev/null "file"
[09:15:46] <zebrag> yes, I had to move that out of the way for the sake of readability

[13:36:08] <johnjaye> well that's what the original error said
[13:36:20] <johnjaye> i meant more which package is responsible. geiser or something else
[13:37:03] <johnjaye> i think i tried usign geiser before but didn't want to read the manual
[13:37:13] <Fernando-Basso> Seems to be geiser, geiser-repl.el to be more precise.
[13:37:24] <johnjaye> like do you open the file *then* start the repl, or do you start one repl and use that for multiples files, etc
[13:37:46] <Fernando-Basso> I open a file and then try run-geiser, and get that error.

[13:43:56] <johnjaye> i think that's a compiler thing
[13:44:04] <johnjaye> but project.el is part of emacs infrastructure

[13:46:08] <Fernando-Basso> Well, the problem is that project-root is void in geiser-repl.el. That declare line perhaps would bring it into scope?
[13:46:38] <johnjaye> maybe. the manual says declare is used to add  meta information to a function for misc things
[13:46:41] <johnjaye> that might be one
[13:46:58] <johnjaye> but the name project-root suggests to me a directory not a file

[18:56:32] <corwin> the native compiler, the byte compiler and the "main" REPL all have different inputs (and outputs).  They aren't redundant, so much as complimentary?

[18:57:30] <blacked> But that , that scrolling still suck in 29
[18:57:36] <wgreenhouse> corwin: SBCL has an interpreter as a special case of its compiler, as a contrasting example. but you only get that design by design, as opposed to accretion
[18:57:53] <tromey> no, it is correct?
[18:58:18] <wgreenhouse> (in SBCL, when you type at the REPL it's actually handing off to the compiler)
[18:58:47] <tromey> the main issue for "always jit" or "always bytecomp" in emacs, IMO, is that then the debugger get really hairy

[19:00:28] <corwin> I don't think it is, anyway.  The REPL executes our code, the byte compiler reads our code and outputs a condensed but still somewhat human readable form.  the native compiler uses GCC JIT to compile our code to machine language.  They... don't do the same thing?

One could argue we really don't need ielm because we can just put text in a buffer and eval it (or maybe it's `eval-defun' and friends that is "extra"?).

[19:18:24] <corwin> frankly, it seems like a bit of a circular argument to first claim Emacs has too much redundancy and then suggest it would be better to develop a custom "micro gcc+gccjit".  When I think about the GNU package, I think in terms of pipelines and algorithmic (repetitive) processing.

Instead of saying "don't use X", I think it would be more respectful (and more interesting to others) if you said "I don't like X because Y", where Y helps us understand the problems you ran into using X.

[21:51:30] <bandali> cheers. and yeah i think new stuff is not exactly cheap :/ especially in the current times
[21:51:44] <bandali> i personally usually go for old used thinkpads off of ebay or something, since i don't really do any heavy computations on them for the most part so i don't need modern CPUs etc

[21:53:59] <pjb> Well, I don't know. I run firefox on a high end laptop, thru X11/ssh, and I find it extremely slow (in fetching and running the javascript stuff, not in the rendering).  So I would imagine that if you use your laptop for modern web, you will need the best you can buy.

[21:54:50] <pjb> Otherwise I'd agree that the network is the computer, so you can use a lightweight laptop as a terminal and run compilation and other jobs on powerful servers.
[21:55:15] <johnjaye> pjb: so the server is the computer but the network is interfacing with the computer so it's the REAL computer not the thing actually being typed on

[23:53:16] <bremner> it isn't in 27, does that help?
[23:53:33] <technomancy> I'm just wondering where it would be defined

[23:54:04] <technomancy> got a patch that includes a call to it and none of my emacsen have that function but my newest is 27. it sure looks like a built-in
[23:54:17] <technomancy> (and also, wtf; how silly is it that it's not a built-in in 27??)

[23:55:00] <technomancy> bremner: thanks!
[23:55:25] <technomancy> I was thinking that since duckduckgo gave me no relevant info it maybe wasn't built-in but it turns out it's just not that good of a search engine =(
[23:55:29] <bremner> well, it says it's new in emacs 28
[23:56:00] <technomancy> I don't write a lot of elisp and I've run into the "wait why doesn't emacs have string-replace built-in" many times
[23:56:06] <bremner> defined in subr.el

[23:56:21] <technomancy> weird that it took this long. I wonder if someone just got tired of saying no, or if the person who kept saying no retired.
