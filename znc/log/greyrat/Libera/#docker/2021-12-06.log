[00:00:02] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: is it all over nc or just some links? perhaps it's a misbehaving app or something

[00:00:17] <njka> rawtaz: kiddie pool's are for small children... and often the small children pee in the kiddie pool :)
[00:00:25] <rawtaz> yeah i'd say it's pretty fair in here
[00:00:34] <njka> it's kinda american slang i guess :)
[00:00:43] <rawtaz> gotcha
[00:01:01] <BinarySavior> rawtaz, not all links, just some of them, for example: when submitting POST request method for login, and also clicking the `home` link in the top left corner.  but links such as `files` `photos` `settings` etc all work just fine
[00:01:05] <njka> basically, the channel gets to be a bunch of stupid little kids peeing everywhere :)
[00:01:31] <rawtaz> njka: what a shame :)
[00:01:36] <njka> like asking about kb shorcuts to open files and stuff
[00:01:50] <njka> things goog would tell them instantly
[00:02:05] <njka> yet for some reason, ppl are fine asking random strangers over asking google :)
[00:02:18] <njka> rawtaz: and your boy who runs the place is as useless as ever :)
[00:02:37] <rawtaz> thts good, then i dont have to feel bad about ditching it :>
[00:03:46] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: either way; if your browser goes to http instead of https it's because NC told it to. it doesnt do it by itself.
[00:03:57] <rawtaz> njka: did you get the M1 Pro yet?
[00:04:01] <rawtaz> or Max

[00:06:12] <rawtaz> they are indeed, have a lot more heavy feel to them. thats a bit of a shame
[00:06:43] <BinarySavior> ok if I go to https://nextcloud.rw:444/ it redirects me to http://nextcloud.rw:444/apps/dashboard 
[00:06:51] <BinarySavior> without clicking on any links
[00:07:04] <ikke> Then look for what is responsible for that redirect
[00:07:08] <rawtaz> right. nextcloud.
[00:07:33] <rawtaz> there will definitely be a setting to override the protocol, just look for it.
[00:07:51] <BinarySavior> should i be looking in nextcloud docker docs?
[00:08:42] <rawtaz> generally speaking the nextcloud docs. but perhaps they mention that setting in the docs for the image over at docker hub, could be 
[00:08:59] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: do you understand why it's happening? nextcloud only sees port 80 traffic, i presume
[00:09:10] <ikke> https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html
[00:09:16] <rawtaz> anything new at work regarding contianers? :)
[00:09:32] <BinarySavior> rawtaz, yes, nextcloud is running only on port 80 inside it's container
[00:09:45] <BinarySavior> with a reverse proxy behind another nginx container
[00:09:58] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: then you understand why this nextcloud is generating links for HTTP
[00:10:07] <rawtaz> it doesnt know any better. and you have to tell it.
[00:10:10] <BinarySavior> rawtaz, i think it might be nginx actually
[00:10:11] <ikke> trusted_domains
[00:10:26] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: to know, simply inspect the URLs coming from nextcloud
[00:10:41] <BinarySavior> i have done that already
[00:11:05] <BinarySavior> the urls say `https` when hovering over them.  but the <a href='/'> doesn't reveal protocol
[00:11:06] <njka> hmmm
[00:11:27] <rawtaz> well its extremely unlikely that nginx is rewriting URLs in the code that nc sends to the browser. so either your links from nc are http and then it's NCs fault, or they arent and well this simply is unlikely to be the case
[00:11:40] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: then look at the base URL in the header of the html
[00:11:52] <BinarySavior> but the behavior can be replicated without clicking any links, from a new, private browser window, if I type in https://nextcloud.rw:444/ it redirects me to http
[00:12:23] <rawtaz> yes, which would be in line with nextcloud thikning only in terms of http

[00:12:49] <BinarySavior> oh ok
[00:13:42] <rawtaz> it does seem odd that you see http when hovering the links. but ht eonly explanation if the urls in the links are what they should be (https) is that nginx is redirecting from https to http
[00:14:14] <BinarySavior> no i see https when hovering links
[00:14:31] <BinarySavior> the only url this is occuring for is base url (https://nextcloud.rw:444/)
[00:14:35] <BinarySavior> all other urls work just fine
[00:15:13] * rawtaz thinks
[00:15:54] <BinarySavior> the base url redirects to /apps/dashboard
[00:16:05] <BinarySavior> whatever is calling the redirect from / to /apps/dashboard is messing up
[00:16:28] <BinarySavior> must be nextcloud
[00:16:43] <rawtaz> is this online somewhere?
[00:16:56] <BinarySavior> no, only on LAN, but i could open it up temporarily if you'd like to see it
[00:16:59] <rawtaz> you might want to look at the base uri in your head of the html
[00:17:06] <rawtaz> you can pastebin that if you want

[00:57:21] <njka> BinarySavior: how are we looking?
[00:57:52] <BinarySavior> If you want Nextcloud to pick up the server host (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST), protocol (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO) and client ip (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR) from a trusted proxy, disable rewrite ip and add the reverse proxies ip address to TRUSTED_PROXIES.
[00:58:05] <BinarySavior> this is what i want to do, right?
[00:58:52] <njka> that sounds like it
[00:59:05] <njka> although i am somewhat out of the loop on what you're trying to do
[00:59:12] <ikke> I've mentioned trusted_proxies an hour ago
[00:59:18] <BinarySavior> so my `trusted proxy` is a docker container 
[00:59:24] <njka> all i've really grokked is that you're doing a conainer for nextcloud
[00:59:33] <BinarySavior> so i need to first figure out what that docker container's ip address is
[00:59:38] <BinarySavior> so that's what i'm doing
[01:00:08] <njka> i get nervous when rawtaz gets this quiet
[01:00:35] <ikke> oh, that was trusted_domains
[01:01:06] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: have you still not added the config option i mentioned?
[01:01:32] <BinarySavior> which one exactly?
[01:01:58] <BinarySavior> you said overwriteprotocol
[01:02:24] <BinarySavior> ok i'll try
[01:03:12] <ikke> trusted_proxies is just for trusting the remote client IP headers though

[01:58:59] <rawtaz> chris-p: where? please provide context

[02:05:12] <rawtaz> this is docker. if minecraft is reporting an error, you must first look at minecraft, why its saying that

[02:08:05] <chris-p> *rawtaz
[02:08:29] <chris-p> it's docker's stats IE when I run docker stats everything is 0
[02:08:46] <tabakhase> docker --version ?

[02:11:39] <tabakhase> odd, the lasts "stats broken" regular issues i remember where in like early 19.
[02:12:42] <chris-p> also I tried "cat /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb/docker/<container uid>/*" for both containers (one that worked, one that didn't) and they didn't look noticably different
[02:12:51] <rawtaz> chris-p: well, its just hard to know. we dont know if you are really looking in the journal for the docker service or if youre just looking in the journal for a inecraft service. this is what happens wehn you dont *show* the context.
[02:12:57] <rawtaz> but you seem to know what youre talking about
[02:13:23] <rawtaz> i have no idea what stats its trying to collect. but is the container not working at all? or is this just an informal error so to speak?
[02:13:40] <chris-p> I'm fairly sure it's the docker service, as it's on the host system and seems to be relating to stats reporting regarding hugeTlB - the container itself is running, but I can't see resource usage
[02:14:14] * njka throws popcorn at rawtaz
[02:14:17] <chris-p> and I searched around hugeTlb is around allocating large contiguous pages of memory, but there was the limit of my google-fu
[02:15:22] <chris-p> I found a bug report, but all it suggested was some build time dependency issues, but I've tried rebuilding (I run gentoo), I've also asked around in their IRC channel
[02:15:35] <chris-p> I can do some more debugging but just wondered if anyone else had come across it

[03:17:49] <rawtaz> oh wait
[03:18:11] <rawtaz> you need to use the COPY command to copy files from the host into the image

[03:21:23] <leitz> rawtaz, I'll try the WORKDIR. I'm a noob, but trying to do things right.
[03:21:50] <rawtaz> leitz: the stuff you RUN inside the image when it's building has no clue about the host/outside of the image

[03:27:33] <rawtaz> oh right
[03:27:45] <rawtaz> it means that it refuses to copy files that are higher up in the filesystem than the Dockerfile itself
[03:27:54] <rawtaz> which is pretty decent, its probaly a security measure
[03:28:11] <leitz> Ah, that's a bummer. I need to build several images that copy the same source.

[04:59:19] <s17> but I also need some env vars in there, Idk if that will be an issue
[05:04:59] <rawtaz> what is it you need to cron and in which container?
[05:05:26] <s17> i have a php script that i want to run every so often and that's it
[05:05:49] <s17> so far, I have started with php:7.4-alpine
[05:07:17] <s17> maybe I don't even need this in a container and should just do it from the host
[05:08:14] <rawtaz> you dont need to run that inside another existing contianer of yours?
[05:08:19] <rawtaz> is it something that just calls stuff on the internet?
[05:08:27] <rawtaz> please be more specific
[05:09:01] <rawtaz> this is a classic example of XY :-)
[05:09:05] <s17> it's a script which will check database for pending SMS to send.
[05:09:17] <s17> if there are any, then it will send via SMS API

[05:10:35] <rawtaz> i c
[05:11:11] <s17> we have a "cron server" already, but it doesn't have php 7 and upgrading may (likely) cause other scripts to break, because they're so old
[05:11:18] <s17> and updating those scripts would jsut be a pain
[05:12:02] <s17> so I thought I'd just make a php 7 container to do it
[05:13:56] <s17> php 7 is needed because the SMS SDK requires it
[05:14:13] <rawtaz> well so either you need to put cron or similar into that php contianer that you are supposed to run it in. or you can modify the script to simply loop and do the recurring calls itself (simplest)
[05:14:40] <rawtaz> or you can use something like ofelia but that requires that you understand the security implications and you should combine it with the docker-socket-proxy
[05:14:49] <s17> so,like have the script be the entrypoint and just loop at an interval?
[05:15:32] <rawtaz> yeah pretty much. php <thescript> perhaps
[05:16:01] <rawtaz> in the script something like  while(true){dothecheck(); sleep(60);}

[14:09:15] <oliverb> Hello people, any hints on how to troubleshoot Docker containers memory usage? On a host with 8G RAM some 20 containers are running for a few days until they "eat" all host memory and all just die. My setup is 1 nginx container, 1 mariadb and 20 instances of wordpress. Will hard limiting (--memory) per container cause only that container hitting the limit to die and leave others to continue working normally? Thank you.

[14:35:24] <simplicity> wombawomba: you cant. You must use host volumes for that. https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/32582
[14:42:02] <simplicity> oliverb: yes. See https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#limit-a-containers-access-to-memory for explanation. You can run "docker stats" on the host to see memory and cpu usage of running containers.

[14:53:42] <oliverb> simplicity: Thank you. I'll try playing with limits. I have checked "docker stats" and it is fine/normal when it is just started, the problem arises after few days of running, it grows infinitely to the point everything dies. I hope hard limiting memory usage per container in combination with "restart: always" will be enough to prevent everything dying and just reset memory usage to starting (low) values. Thanks again.

[15:07:22] <Xeroine> according to this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63823884/docker-image-layer-what-does-add-filesome-hash-in-mean whenever you make a Dockerfile, ADD some file, build the image and then check the history the ADDed file name would be replaced with some hash in "docker history". what's the reason to do this though? why not just have the filename show up instead of some hash?
[15:08:45] <Xeroine> if for example the Dockerfile and the ADDed file are on github in some repo could I check if the file on github has the same hash as the one that's in "docker history"?

[20:17:46] <ada_> gebbione: if I understand the question correctly, no
[20:17:52] <ada_> not sure what "tag a volume" means
[20:18:27] <ada_> a VOLUME instruction in a dockerfile is going to create a new, empty anonymous volume if the user doesn't choose to mount a volume at runtime.  so, technically, yes, a volume would get created, but it will be empty
[20:18:48] <ada_> if you are asking about a named volume you already have on your local machine, and you want those files in the volume to exist on the remote server, you'd need to rsync or cp them to the server first

[20:50:54] <BtbN> programmerq, Yeah, I'd expect it to work as well. I'm a bit confused what it's upset about.
[20:51:27] <programmerq> ash_worksi sockets can work between containers, but it's a huge pain and you don't really get much value by using a unix domain socket compared to just using the docker networking in my opinion.
[20:51:39] <programmerq> I'd only bother with sockets if it was literally the only thing some piece of software supported.
[20:52:11] <ash_worksi> programmerq: thanks, that's exactly the answer I'm looking for
[20:52:29] <ash_worksi> just out of curiosity, do you have a particular port you like to make microservices available on?

[21:01:29] <rawtaz> im surprised your client reacts to be honest. just generally speaking, im using irssi with default settings, and it only highlights/alerts when someone actively address me using e.g.  nick: message  notation - it doesnt care a shit about someone writing my nick in the middle of a sentence, for example. i thought this was the general default in irc clients.

[21:05:49] <BtbN> Does buildkit even care about what's tagged on the "host docker"? I thought it's fully separate, and only the --load makes it explicitly export to it?
[21:06:13] <programmerq> BtbN▸ also, what's the 'docker buildx ls' output? if your builder isn't the type 'docker' then it won't be able to use the locally available images.
[21:06:43] <BtbN> It's the result of: docker buildx create --use --bootstrap --name larger_log --driver-opt env.BUILDKIT_STEP_LOG_MAX_SIZE=52428800
[21:07:35] <BtbN> I'm aware that it can't use all images from the host, but I'd expect it to be able to base new images on top of images it literally just built itself two seconds ago

[21:08:17] <BtbN> Not really
[21:09:22] <BtbN> Or does it really not remember a "--tag something" internally? That's insanely inconvenient and makes it close to useless.
[21:09:25] <programmerq> yes it does, lol. it clearly shows that your active builder is using the 'docker-container' driver, not the 'docker' driver. As far as I know, buildkit doesn't persist its image tags to be available in subsequent builds, so this is expected behavior. 'docker-container' is an isolated builder. 'docker' does have your local docker stuff available.
[21:09:37] <programmerq> it just has the build cache and that's it.

[21:10:29] <BtbN> any sane way to do that, that's not grepping the docker buildx ls output?
[21:12:18] <programmerq> there's 'docker buildx inspect' which returns info about the currently selected builder only.
[21:12:38] <BtbN> Hm, or I explicitly create a builder in the script, and somehow make sure to clean it up after the fact
[21:12:39] <programmerq> you could also set an output type to go to a registry
[21:12:57] <programmerq> and then refer to the pushed image
[21:12:58] <BtbN> That'd pointlessly push several GB around the internet. Out of my DSL upstrea. No thanks.
[21:13:06] <programmerq> you could push it to a local registry
