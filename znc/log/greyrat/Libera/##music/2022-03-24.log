[20:44:57] <louipc> are u an iceman
[20:49:37] <Panther> I have been taking icy showers :)
[20:50:15] <Panther> I don't have a frozen lake nearby to plunge into. :-/
[20:51:52] <Panther> But, all year long, I sit here in just shorts with the a/c set to 60F.
[20:52:00] *** Inline__ is now known as Inline
[20:52:24] <nativetexan> that's chilly
[20:53:57] <Panther> Maybe that's part of the reason they are putting in all these energy saving measures. :)
[20:54:13] <nativetexan> yeah could be

[21:00:19] <Panther> Those pricks started working on the elevator at 7am... 
[21:02:00] <Panther> ... I went and banged on it, and I told them they woke me up from a sound sleep, and the guy didn't even apologize, he said in a smirky way, 'have a nice day', so I told him to fuck himself with the tool he was using.

[21:05:44] <nativetexan> royal blood is coming to houston may 14th for the live nation concert
[21:06:14] <Panther> So, I called the property manager, and she said she would 'ask' them to not sart until 8, but that they have a schedule to maintain, and I explained to her the reason for that is because the prior management waited until both elevators were so broken that it turned into a crisis that has to be done on an emergency basis.
[21:08:18] <Panther> Nice, are you gonna go?
[21:08:45] <nativetexan> not sure yet
[21:09:04] <nativetexan> i tried to look up ticket prices but the site didn't like this vpn
