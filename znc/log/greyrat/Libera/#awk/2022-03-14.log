[00:00:45] <Torr> Hey
[00:01:08] <Torr> What's the difference between <|> and <|&> for piping commands?
[00:01:29] <Torr> Not sure if this is Gawk only.
[00:01:57] <Torr> # awk '{c="ls"; c | getline l; close(c); print l;}'
[00:02:04] <shbot> Torr: no output within the time limit
[00:02:18] <Torr> # awk '{c="echo bla"; c | getline l; close(c); print l;}'
[00:02:25] <shbot> Torr: no output within the time limit
[00:02:32] <Torr> # gawk '{c="echo bla"; c | getline l; close(c); print l;}'
[00:02:39] <shbot> Torr: no output within the time limit
[00:03:10] <yeti> try with BEGIN
[00:03:23] <Torr> # awk 'BEGIN{c="echo bla"; c | getline l; close(c); print l;}'
[00:03:25] <shbot> Torr: bla
[00:03:35] <Torr> yeti: Thanks
[00:03:46] <Torr> # awk 'BEGIN{c="echo bla"; c |& getline l; close(c); print l;}'
[00:03:52] <shbot> Torr: awk: syntax error at source line 1
[00:03:52] <shbot> Torr:  context is
[00:03:52] <shbot> Torr: etc... ( http://ix.io/3S9o )
[00:03:57] <Torr> # gawk 'BEGIN{c="echo bla"; c |& getline l; close(c); print l;}'
[00:03:59] <shbot> Torr: bla
[00:04:17] <Torr> # gawk 'BEGIN{c="echo bla"; c | getline l; close(c); print l;}'
[00:04:18] <shbot> Torr: bla
[00:04:26] <Torr> Works the same.
[00:04:33] <Torr> In this case at least.
[00:04:42] <yeti> |&  is a gawkism?
[00:04:49] <Torr> Seems to be.
[00:04:52] <yeti> ok
[00:05:02] <yeti> I dont use it
[00:05:07] <Torr> It's on Gawk's manpage, but not on Awk's.
[00:05:19] <larryv> https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Getline_002fCoprocess.html
[00:05:39] <yeti> naaaaah...  I won't...
[00:05:51] <yeti> I keep my awking clean
[00:06:28] <Torr> Hmm, now it makes sense.
[00:07:05] <Torr> Thank you

[15:01:30] <taeaad> How can I limit the amount of lines summed in a CSV column? This is the template:
[15:01:50] <taeaad> awk -F\, '{sum+=$9;}END{print sum;}' 'test.csv'
[15:01:51] <taeaad>  
[15:02:24] <taeaad> ... would print the sum of column 9. How can I sum e.g. just the first 100 lines of the CSV for that column?
[15:05:35] <Patsie> awk -F\, 'NR<=100 {sum+=$9;}END{print sum;}' 'test.csv'
[15:05:53] <Patsie> awk 'pattern {action}'
[15:06:16] <Patsie> NR == current number of record (line)
[15:06:59] <Earnest> No need to quote the , for -F
[15:07:19] <Patsie> awk -F, 'NR<=100 {sum+=$9} END {print sum}' 'test.csv'
[15:07:25] <Patsie> and no need for the semi-colons either
[15:09:58] <taeaad> Thanks. The quote is a remnant of me sometimes using '|'.
[15:10:04] <Earnest> *insert usual caveats about CSV being not necessarily line based and , not necessarily being a separator depending on context*
[15:10:10] <taeaad> So NR is a special variable?
[15:10:21] <Earnest> It's not special per-se, it's a builtin one, there are others
[15:10:41] <Patsie> yes, NR == current number of record, just like NF is number of fields (columns)
[15:11:05] <Earnest> Like FILENAME, OFMT, OFS/ORS, RLENGTH, RS, etc.
[15:11:09] <taeaad> I see, thanks! I also didn't realise it would be outside the curly brackets.
[15:11:20] <Earnest> I suppose POSIX does call them "special variables" in the manual, so fair enough
[15:11:42] <Earnest> taeaad: Try read the POSIX manual for awk, usually `man 1p awk' on Linux with man-pages installed
[15:12:17] <Earnest> taeaad: Those manuals tend to be a lot clearer and concise than GNU versions
[15:12:30] <Earnest> Obviously it only covers POSIX features, but that's usually enough
[15:13:15] <Earnest> I like the old unix manuals where the SECTION NAMES actually took up the entire left margin, and the content was in another column.  Like sidenotes, but for titles
[15:13:31] <Earnest> I wonder if man(1) can be made to increase width of content, hm
[15:13:49] <taeaad> What is 1p?
[15:14:04] <Patsie> a manual section
[15:14:24] <taeaad> "No manual entry for awk in section 1p"
[15:14:49] <taeaad> Let me check for Debian.
[15:14:58] <Patsie> not every OS devides it in the same sections
[15:15:09] <Patsie> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections
[15:16:47] <Earnest> taeaad: foo.1p is convention for posix manuals and perl manuals
[15:17:00] <Earnest> man foo.1 <=> man 1 foo
[15:18:18] <Earnest> If section is not specified (gnu) man will use MANSECT which is sequence of sections to try
