[21:28:24] <kayvank> looking to contribute to the LambdaHack, , I've been doing haskell for a year and welcome any suggestion plz
[21:30:50] <ManofLetters[m]> kayvank: hi! I'm the maintainer :) feel free to ask questions here or at #lambdahack (only if too boring for this general room)
[21:32:01] <ManofLetters[m]> there's been little traffic here recently, so it should be fun to get some discussions going, e.g., about what we talk in relation to LambdaHack
[21:35:08] <f-a> \o/
[21:35:35] <f-a> I suspect everyone is pressing F5 and being non-productive
[21:35:37] <f-a> at least I am
[21:38:27] <ManofLetters[m]> party!
[21:38:32] <ManofLetters[m]> ðŸŽ‰
[21:38:52] <ManofLetters[m]> especially if the nukes are going to fall soon
[21:39:41] <ManofLetters[m]> let's ride the last days in style
[21:42:52] <EvanR> what does F5 do
[21:45:47] <ManofLetters[m]> starts a part
[21:45:51] <ManofLetters[m]>  * starts a party
[21:46:18] <ManofLetters[m]> *not on all OSes
[21:46:19] <kayvank> ManofLetters: thank you for getting back to me. I also commented on issue#283 and saw your response as well.Since it seems to be OK with you, I prefer to party at the IRC too, :)
[21:46:57] <f-a> is that reload page, EvanR ? (I actually reload with â€˜râ€™)
[21:47:42] <EvanR> all I know is alt F4 makes the map download faster
[21:47:46] *** Quits: srk (~sorki@user/srk) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[21:47:50] <kayvank> ManofLetters[m]: I am on nixOS and with some effort was able to build the project OK and do the "make play"
[21:48:22] <ManofLetters[m]> +1
[21:48:42] <ManofLetters[m]> with `cabal.project.local.development` that speeds up compilation?
[21:49:42] <kayvank> ManofLetters[m]: thnx, I'll that do that next.
[21:49:44] <ManofLetters[m]> (I forgot that #lambdahack is not on IRC, only on Matrix, bridged from Discord; but this here channel is fine, until the other devs chase us away)
[21:49:56] *** Quits: coot (~coot@213.134.190.95) (Quit: coot)
[21:50:11] <ManofLetters[m]> I hope that's explained in README, but let me know if anything in unclear
