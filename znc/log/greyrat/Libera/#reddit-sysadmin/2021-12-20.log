[11:12:58] <Hunterkll> @signalv they with intel intentionally backdate the drivers to a stupid early date, so if you install newer ones, it won't overwrite/try to upgrade via wsus
[11:13:27] <Hunterkll> 1968 is actually when intel was founded
[11:13:32] <Hunterkll> that's why they use that year
[11:14:10] <Hunterkll> in fact, you'll find the driver's actually dated 7/16/1968

[11:15:28] <Hunterkll> Intel(R) Chipset Device Software uses an unusual date for the devices it is targeting. The date 07/18/1968 is symbolic – Intel was founded that day. The reason this date is used is to lower the rank of Intel(R) Chipset Device Software.This is necessary because it’s a supporting utility that should not overwrite any other drivers. Updating Intel(R) Chipset Device Software is not needed
[11:15:43] <Hunterkll> from the intel chipset inf utility readme

[16:12:35] <SirSantalot> stindjzjeee?
[16:12:39] <SirSantalot> that's probably it
[16:12:43] <lancehead> SirSantalot: Already tried that 
[16:12:45] <lancehead> They're on extend 
[16:13:33] <SirSantalot> so in the display settings you've got 3 monitors showing?

[16:14:04] <lancehead> No, two 
[16:14:07] <lancehead> But there's 3 on 
[16:14:21] <lancehead> And 2 are duplicating because it sees them as the same monitor 
[16:14:48] <SirSantalot> if windows is duplicating it shows as something like 2|3
[16:15:38] <SirSantalot> like Roughy said: how are they connected?
[16:15:58] <SirSantalot> both directly to the laptop, through daisy chain or with a switch/hub?
[16:16:21] <lancehead> Hub
[16:16:27] <lancehead> It shows monitor 1 and monitor 2 
[16:16:32] <lancehead> But monitor 2 is two monitors
[16:16:34] <lancehead> Essentially 
[16:16:41] <lancehead> It's definitely wacky and not just a windows setting 
[16:16:50] <SirSantalot> and monitor 1 is the laptop monitor?
[16:16:58] <lancehead> ye
[16:17:26] <SirSantalot> the hub supports MST?
[16:17:53] <SirSantalot> I think you can get those things that only support duplication, and not multi screens
[16:18:14] <lancehead> Yeah it does, we have other people using them and it works fine 
[16:19:04] <SirSantalot> well, afaik laptop, DP cable and hub all have to support mst for that to work
[16:19:13] <lancehead> They do

[16:30:52] <csws> does the laptop have discrete graphics?
[16:31:02] <lancehead> ye
[16:31:06] <SirSantalot> so installing the drivers doesn't do anything?
[16:31:10] <csws> installed drivers for IGP and discrete?
[16:31:31] <csws> are you using both HDMIs?
[16:31:33] <lancehead> I have and it doesn't 
[16:31:34] <lancehead> And yes I am 
[16:31:35] <csws> if not.. swap them around?

[16:31:59] <csws> LOL
[16:32:03] <SirSantalot> good job

[16:34:50] <SirSantalot> same laptop, dock, cables, monitors and resolution?
[16:34:54] <lancehead> Nope..

[16:37:40] * csws quietly removes the caller info
[16:37:42] * csws closes the ticket again

[16:39:46] <SirSantalot> lancehead, but seriously, start with basics. You did say you have others using this dock? If you can nab one of their laptops, hang it on that dock it see if it works there, and vica versa
[16:40:35] <SirSantalot> csws, did I just become shadow IT?
[16:40:56] <csws> meh who cares

[16:52:37] <csws> fuck yeah
[16:52:58] <csws> I'd also get a piss receptacle
[16:53:57] <csws> can probably get a nice stainless steel one for like $1000 extra
[16:54:10] <csws> then you can fire all the cleaners and turn the toilet block into additional office space

[16:55:19] <DrZak> ah fsck this european reliance on slave workforce
[16:55:47] <DrZak> japan with 100 mil ppl has 9! new cases of covid
[16:55:57] <DrZak> and nobody can enter
[16:55:58] <csws> how will they ever survive
[16:56:17] <csws> northern territory picked up like 3 more I think
[16:56:23] <DrZak> whihc presumably along with that higher volume of enzymeX production causes low covid

[18:28:36] <SirSantalot> it's just the idea yuken, I didn't even watch the actual video

[19:05:28] <yuken> haha, I only just realised
[19:05:48] <int0x1C8> but as a hardcore space history enthusiast its hard for me to reconcile what von braun did for the US space industry given he was a literal nazi
[19:05:59] <yuken> csws, in Tom Lehrer's Wernher Von Braun, he's satirizing how the US took him in, right... and towards the end he says "In German, oder English, I know how to count down - and I'm learning Chinese, says Wernher Von Braun"
[19:06:05] <yuken> and this was in like, the 50s-60s.
[19:06:09] <yuken> So before China was the superpower it is today.
[19:07:09] <csws> welp

[19:10:29] <SantasWiFi> csws: hows it hangin down under?
[19:11:06] <csws> SantasWiFi, going to be stinking hot for Christmas
[19:11:10] <SantaGibby> FELDA.IO IS BACK
[19:11:20] <csws> 42 C
[19:11:27] <csws> 107.6 F
[19:11:58] <int0x1C8> fuck that
[19:12:07] <mistiry> when i was in paris train station (just there for a layover) a couple years ago it was 108F
[19:12:14] <mistiry> so miserable
[19:12:34] <vinrock> wat
[19:12:35] <vinrock> ew
[19:12:42] <mistiry> we bought ice cream and sat in a starbucks under a ceiling fan trying not to die
[19:13:10] <int0x1C8> the ice cream flash vaporized
[19:13:19] <mistiry> damn near it
[19:13:46] <mistiry> i wasnt too bad, but my boss and his wife, both older and heavier folks with other medical things, didnt handle it so well
[19:14:05] <mistiry> luckily heat wave ended at some point during the trip, so _most_ of the time it was comfortable
[19:14:31] <SantasWiFi> csws: so bizzare for me to hear that lol
[19:14:32] <int0x1C8> at that temp those personal cooling things you can get probably don't work either
[19:15:07] <mistiry> int0x1C8: yeah it was bad. and since very few things have AC, there was little respite
[19:15:16] <csws> yeah at these temps your only hope is reverse cycle AC
[19:15:31] <mistiry> the first day we made it to London, was supposed to take a train from there that day but trains were down so we had to get a hotel in london
[19:15:34] <mistiry> no AC of course
[19:15:46] <mistiry> i bought a chocolate bar that was _melted_ in the morning
[19:15:47] <csws> they slow the trains down here at 40+
[19:15:49] <technonerd> AC is the most american thing ever
[19:15:49] <int0x1C8> lots of EU tends to not have AC
[19:15:55] <mistiry> yeah
[19:15:57] <int0x1C8> that's probably going to change
[19:16:04] <mistiry> also agree there. its getting too hot.
[19:16:09] <technonerd> in warmer states its the AC unit per floor
[19:16:12] <csws> man vancouver was hell for that
[19:16:19] <csws> the summer wasn't hot but lack of AC made it hell on earth
[19:16:22] <csws> no shade either
[19:16:24] <csws> no sea breeze
[19:16:25] <csws> wtf
[19:16:29] <mistiry> yeah
[19:16:40] <technonerd> stuck in the dark ages
[19:16:41] <csws> well maybe a sea breeze if you're right in the city but where I was, I got nothing from the fraser river
[19:16:41] <mistiry> itw as nice after the heat wave ended
[19:16:53] <yuken> love yoyu vinrock 
[19:16:55] <mistiry> india was bad too
[19:16:59] <csws> my apartment was like an oven
[19:17:00] <mistiry> the hotel had AC though
[19:17:03] <mistiry> but only down to 23c
[19:17:11] <csws> idk that's pretty normal
[19:17:23] <csws> datacentre aircon is sitting around 17C
[19:17:28] <csws> I guess nobody told them mainframes are dead
[19:17:31] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lol ONLY 23c
[19:17:35] <csws> I nearly freeze to death in there
[19:17:54] <csws> nextdc P1 seems to use ~25c for the cold aisle temps and I nearly melted in there
[19:18:12] <mistiry> @bdenlinger i dont think it ever actually reached that though
[19:18:24] <mistiry> but it was nice to have _some_ relief while there in india
[19:18:39] <mistiry> also we specifically sought out hotels when planning the trip that had AC
[19:18:42] <csws> does india still get endless rolling blackouts?
[19:18:42] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Even when I had a real AC, not window units, I never kept it below 25c
[19:18:51] <int0x1C8> during summer I keep my apartment at 62f, ~17c
[19:18:56] <mistiry> csws: didnt have any when i was there
[19:19:00] <yuken> That's a great temperature int0x1C8.
[19:19:06] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> wtf
[19:19:12] <csws> 22 is perfect imo
[19:19:28] <mistiry> 22 is about what i set my home AC to
[19:19:42] <mistiry> when i travel i usually drop the AC as low as it will go
[19:19:47] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> 25 in the summer 20 or lower in the winter
[19:20:00] <mistiry> at ignite a couple years ago, i hacked the thermostat so i could drop it under their set minimum
[19:20:06] <mistiry> then went and told cowokers how to hack it
[19:20:15] <int0x1C8> and then I normally only run the heat less than 10 times total throughout the winter
[19:20:18] <mistiry> we had condensation on our doors it was so cold in the rooms lol
[19:20:39] <yuken> If you're cold, you can layer  up

[19:22:07] <mistiry> yep thats usually all it takes
[19:22:08] <yuken> and I prefer raw onions csws 
[19:22:10] <yuken> so don't ask.
[19:22:14] <csws> yeah ok
[19:22:20] <csws> my eyes are watering at the thought
[19:22:22] <int0x1C8> <3 onions
[19:22:28] <yuken> I can eat an onion like an apple.
[19:22:29] <csws> it looks alright aside from the onions
[19:22:31] <yuken> so good.
[19:22:33] <vinrock> yeah i love onions
[19:22:42] <csws> h mm
[19:22:43] <csws> mmm
[19:22:43] <mistiry> i like cooked onion
[19:22:43] <int0x1C8> gimme all da garlic and onions
[19:22:44] <yuken> csws, just cheap frozen pizza, but hey, doesn't taste too bad honestly.
[19:22:45] <mistiry> not raw tho
[19:22:45] <csws> fried onion is alright
[19:22:46] <vinrock> i like a bigol fat slice of onion on my burger
[19:22:47] <csws> raw onion.. jfc
[19:22:48] <yuken> especialyl for how easy it is to make.
[19:22:50] <mistiry> int0x1C8: garlic++++++++
[19:22:53] <mistiry> i love garlic
[19:23:04] <mistiry> raw onions are a no from me dawg
[19:23:06] <vinrock> mistiry you get good pizza where you're at
[19:23:18] <mistiry> vinrock: meh, theres a couple of decent places but not the best ive ever had
[19:23:26] <vinrock> you should try a garlic pie
[19:23:26] <mistiry> i really want to get a pizza steel or a pizza oven
[19:23:31] <mistiry> so i can make better pizzas at home
[19:23:32] <yuken> I think the best places for pizza here is either a local wood-fired pizza place, which just so happens to be like a 2 minute walk down the road from me
[19:23:34] <yuken> or Gioinos
[19:23:43] <yuken> Gionino's*
[19:23:44] <int0x1C8> I made hashbrowns yesterday, and damn if soy sauce doesn't go pretty well with them

[19:24:20] <yuken> csws, check this out. Pizza place around here ,Gionino's, makes these: https://www.gioninos.com/Content/images/jojo-potatoes.jpg
[19:24:24] <yuken> They're breaded, deep-fried potatoes.
[19:24:31] <yuken> And they're as big as your hand.
[19:24:39] <mistiry> potato wedges arent unique 
[19:24:45] <mistiry> hell i think KFC even sells them lol
[19:24:47] <yuken> mistiry, but they're BREADED!
[19:24:52] <mistiry> yeah...not uncommon
[19:25:02] <yuken> Really? I ain't never seen breaded potato wedges elsewhere.
[19:25:03] <int0x1C8> in fact I've stopped using plain ketchup, I mix a bit of soy sauce in it
[19:25:16] <mistiry> oh KFC removed them i guess
[19:25:22] <csws> tbh never seen breaded wedges
[19:25:25] <yuken> int0x1C8, I still can't get the hang of hashbrowns from scratch. Always a bit too... soft, not enough crunch.
[19:25:37] <vinrock> double fry em
[19:25:44] <mistiry> but yeah... a breaded and fried potato wedge isnt like uncommon or anything
[19:25:54] <mistiry> par fry
[19:25:55] <yuken> I thought it was mistiry, never seen it myself.
[19:25:56] <int0x1C8> in my case it was my skillet
[19:26:04] <mistiry> thats the secret to good fried potatoes
[19:26:07] <mistiry> par fry and freeze
[19:26:13] <vinrock> any you guys remember when burger king had those blister fried fries in the late 90s
[19:26:14] <yuken> Cast iron here, int0x1C8
[19:26:15] <yuken> so that's good to go.
[19:26:19] <vinrock> goddamn they were so good
[19:26:24] <int0x1C8> went and got a nice nonstick ceramic, much better
[19:26:36] <yuken> mistiry, really? So shred, squeeze moisture out, then partially freeze?
[19:26:47] <mistiry> no
[19:26:51] <mistiry> its called 'par fry'
[19:26:58] <mistiry> you lightly fry first
[19:26:59] <yuken> oh, you mean that method.
[19:27:00] <mistiry> and then freeze
[19:27:07] <yuken> I know that method, but idk if that'll work with hashbrowns.
[19:27:25] <int0x1C8> otherwise I just followed the directions on the bag
[19:27:40] <mistiry> yuken: for homemade hasbrowns, yes it is
[19:27:49] <mistiry> for pre-made frozen ones, they are already par fried
[19:27:52] <yuken> hmmm.
[19:28:08] <int0x1C8> light covering of oil on the bottom of pan (I used canola), spread evenly and cook on med-high for 6 minutes
[19:28:08] <mistiry> nearly any fried potato dish you will want to par fry for best texture, browning, and results
[19:28:15] <yuken> I might have to go try this mistiry. How "par-fried" are we talking here?
[19:28:28] <mistiry> usually just a few minutes, before any color starts
[19:28:28] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> popeyes has wedges
[19:28:30] <yuken> When I do big fries, I boil them then roast them.
[19:28:37] <mistiry> par boil is a thing too
[19:28:38] <yuken> but can't do that with hashbrowns.
[19:28:51] <int0x1C8> flip, put a bit of oil on top, then flip and cook another 5 mins
[19:28:53] <yuken> mistiry, we're talking boiling to completion, like completely soft and ready to fall apart.
[19:28:56] <yuken> Then roast at high heat to brown the outside.
[19:29:01] <int0x1C8> then I like to put about a tbsp of butter
[19:29:06] <int0x1C8> and let that melt/fry in

[23:45:51] <Activ8> if the R350 will last another 5 years it's fine but I see a lot of companies migrate just because there's no more head room in warranty and the systems been outdated that much they can't migrate
[23:46:01] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> or they are
[23:46:13] <Activ8> and there was a company migrated every year, cost them a fortune
[23:47:29] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> Activ8: what about switches
[23:47:36] <mistiry> For instance, virtualize your workloads. Use a bare-metal HV, doesnt really matter just something you are comfortable with (hell, Hyper-V Core is free if you want to stick with MS). Now future hardware upgrades are easier as you can take advantage of clustering technologies.

[23:47:38] <layer8> mistiry meant: "For instance, virtualize your workloads.

[23:47:53] <Activ8> oh the R350 will be perfectly fine 
[23:48:01] <CptLuxx> sad that hyperv free is dead
[23:48:02] <Activ8> sorry I didn't check the item, dell still sell these

[23:48:58] <Activ8> Telgareith I don't think switches go out of date as much as servers unless they fail really
[23:49:07] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> thats my opinion
[23:49:21] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> have a migration plan for the switches when they get old
[23:49:27] <Activ8> yeh understandable
[23:49:39] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> but you don't need to replace them until they fail or underperform
[23:49:40] <Activ8> i think it's about planning at the end of the day the r350 is a nice unit 
[23:50:01] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> if its the box I think R350's are fine for small loads
[23:51:15] <Activ8> with switches you limited to bandwidth and amount of traffic, same as servers really I guess so depends on how many users you have on your network
[23:51:26] <Activ8> we got a right mixed bag of servers across all of our customers
[23:56:47] <sd> 14<J​ohnGypsy> Sorry, was afk for a bit...
[23:58:35] <sd> 14<J​ohnGypsy> Yes, current plan is to actually replace 3 R320 servers -- all running Windows Server 2012R2 with TWO beefier R350 servers which will run Hyper-V.  We'd do p2v for the existing servers into VMs.  The idea is that we'd share the load between the two new servers -- but, honestly, all 3 would be fine on one VM -- so doing it this way always leaves one of the servers as a spare that could quickly bring up the other server's VMs if something went wro
[23:58:57] <sd> 14<J​ohnGypsy> Then, next year, upgrade from 2012R2 to more current.
[23:59:04] <mistiry> Dont run one as a "spare"
[23:59:07] <mistiry> Cluster them
[23:59:12] <DrZak> wouldnt be a fresh reinstall better?
[23:59:12] <mistiry> And run both active
[23:59:12] <sd> 14<J​ohnGypsy> And the new R350 server would have 4-5 years of warranty.
[23:59:59] <sd> 14<J​ohnGypsy> A "fresh reinstall" would require a lot more re-configuration.  A lot more labor involved there.  Especially when everything is currently running well -- they'd just like to stick to hardware that isn't 8+ years old...
