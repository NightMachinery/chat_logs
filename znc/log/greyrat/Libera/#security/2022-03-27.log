[03:30:57] <ww1986> hello
[03:31:40] <ww1986> Is this working?
[03:32:55] <ww1986> Okay here's the issue (briefly): I get trolled online by the Russian security service and their foreign civilian contact networks. Particularly in my country of Finland, there are a lot of these local trolls. (Afterall the term finlandzierung was named after our country, and the country was described as the laboratory for the KGB where they have
[03:32:55] <ww1986> experimented on influencing a Western capitalistic society, thus perhaps not so surprising)
[03:33:20] <ww1986> Regardless, my online connection has gotten censored quite a bit, such that I can't find online communities from google easily, or join facebook groups and that sort of thing

[03:34:34] <ww1986> More recently, as I've started playing this online videogame called DOTA2, which is a team game of 2 teams and 5 players in each team, there has been a trolling scheme such that the players who end up in the match are not "random" at all, but instead exclusively each player in both teams is a troll recruited by the Russians either directly or
[03:34:34] <ww1986> implicitly.
[03:35:15] <ww1986> I'm wondering if there might be anything that can be done about this issue
[03:35:19] *** Quits: spanishsunrise (uid393013@id-393013.hampstead.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[03:36:12] <ww1986> All the civilian recruits themselves might not know that they're involved with the Russians, as they say, the Russians have a way of "hiding their hand". If there's direct or indirect control over some organization or a network of people, that the Russians have attained, it might not be necessary to inform the people in it about the true nature of
[03:36:13] <ww1986> what is happening.
[03:36:49] <ww1986> For an example I've tried bringing this videogame issue up with Valve's "Steam Support" system that they have in their platform. It looks like the support tickets I have sent were censored and didn't reach their destination.
[03:37:16] <ww1986> This appearance is partially based on that the responses have not really dealt with the substance of the ticket, but rather some generic unrelated answer templates have been used
[03:38:03] *** Joins: rickybob (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob)
[03:38:38] <ww1986> E.g. I've sent a support ticket saying things like "Due to targeted harassment from the Russian security service FSB, the players in the matches of DOTA2  that I play have recently had exclusively these local trolls recruited by the Russians. This implies that the matchmaking system's integrity is broken either by hacking the Valve inc's servers,
[03:38:38] <ww1986> or misdirecting my DOTA2 client's connection to a fake server" and then I would receive a response like "The DOTA2 team is always interested in feedback about improving the match making system and follows discussions on public forums."
[03:38:52] <ww1986> Or a generic answer template of that sort
[03:39:16] <ww1986> So I don't know if those tickets made it anywhere, or if they did, if they made it in their original form (e.g. the substance was altered)
[03:39:50] <ww1986> Additionally I used the CIA's website online form and tried to convey some limited information about my experiences using that venue, but there's a decent chance that didn't make it anywhere either

[03:54:27] *** tjr7 is now known as tjr
[03:55:55] <NiLon> you see, russian troll factories have this campaign trying to make it seem like finland has some sort of "problem" so that russia can attack and "save" the people from it
[03:56:14] <NiLon> your stuff fits 100% to this propaganda
[03:56:24] <NiLon> so I don't you live in finland at all

[04:00:56] <Guest14> ww1986 is disturbed person, disregard him
[04:01:05] <ww1986> ^ ok this one is a russia troll at least
[04:01:13] *** Quits: filename (~kilitary@188.242.105.134) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:01:23] <Guest54> This person sees everyone as a russian troll, but is being the biggest russian troll him self.
[04:01:27] <NiLon> like what you get out of from hurting innocent people
[04:01:41] <ww1986> Ironista kyllä NiLon on suomalainen venäjätrolli, joita suomessa on paljon, ja nämä hänen typerät kysymyksensä ovat tyhjänpäiväisiä, samoin kuten hänen virheelliset johtopäätöksensä.

[04:02:05] <Guest54> mikä tekee hänestä trollin?
[04:02:16] <Guest54> ja mikä ei tee sinusta trolliA?
[04:02:22] <ww1986> It's a waste of time to continue this chat, because the person with the username NiLon is a Russia troll
[04:02:29] <ww1986> I have an actual issue to discuss, and this is just a distraction
[04:02:49] <ww1986> As part of harassment by the Russian security service FSB my online connection has been censored and I've been subjected to online trolling
[04:03:03] *** Quits: Auron (Auron956@user/auron) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:03:03] <Guest14> Kek
[04:03:08] <ww1986> more often than not this trolling is actually conducted by civilian recruits for the Russians rather than the actual staff of the security services
[04:03:17] <ww1986> in Finland this is done by regular citizens
[04:03:23] <ww1986> and person I just mentioned here is one of them trolls
[04:03:33] <ajak> ww1986: why do you assume the worst of people that don't believe your grandiose posturing?
[04:03:45] <ww1986> ajak, because i've had several years of experience dealing with Russia trolls
[04:03:51] <Guest54> You are overestimating the power of russia. Haven't you seen how the war is going in ukraine?
[04:04:06] <ww1986> military power and espionage power are related but not the same
[04:04:23] <Guest54> so is psychosis and reality
[04:04:25] <ajak> ww1986: maybe so, but let's not do that here
[04:04:51] <ww1986> I'd like to remind you, ajak, that the person NiLon accused me of being a Russia troll, before I returned the favor
[04:05:13] <ww1986> where as I was just trying to start a discussion about some cyber harassment patterns used by the RUssians in my case
[04:05:13] <NiLon> no miks se on niin vaikee vastata kysymyksii
[04:05:21] <Guest54> watch out ajak, you are next.
[04:05:36] <Guest14> Hullu mikä hullu
[04:06:30] <Guest54> Let's put it this way. What makes you so special to the russians, that they use this amount of resources to troll one single person?
[04:06:58] <ww1986> I'd like to note that the two guests that joined the channel are such trolls from Finland
[04:07:11] <ww1986> and this is an attempt to distract the conversation as usual
[04:07:14] <Guest54> i actually live in petroskoi,
[04:07:24] <Guest54> false claim again.
[04:07:30] <NiLon> I've been here for years so you think I've been waiting for you all that time? That's delusional
[04:07:41] <ww1986> Guest14 at least is a Russia troll from Finland
[04:07:53] <Guest14> Da da tavaritsh
[04:07:57] <ww1986> NiLon, okay you're definitely a russia troll
[04:08:14] <NiLon> and how you figure that?
[04:08:31] <ww1986> Okay time to stop answering these trolls, I'd like to discuss the actual issue
[04:08:46] <ww1986> which is online harassment  by Russian security services (Although some of the comments are part of that)
[04:08:50] <Guest14> ww1986 is powerful free thinker and threat to society
[04:08:58] <ww1986> my online connection has been censored to quite an extent
[04:09:16] <ww1986> such that connections to chatrooms and such have been hijacked to similar places, with only a couple of russia trolls speaking
[04:09:16] <NiLon> I mean if you can publish your writings in news, how is that censorship
[04:09:32] <NiLon> as far I see, no one is limiting your ability to say and publish whatever
[04:09:52] <Guest14> ww1986 the truth is, the game was rigged from the start
[04:10:21] *** Joins: filename (~kilitary@188.242.105.134)
[04:10:21] <Guest14> We are watching your every move
[04:10:23] <ww1986> well we can discuss russian espionage in general perhaps then
[04:10:31] <Guest54> Still waiting an asnwer for this . What makes you so special to the russians, that they use this amount of resources to troll one single person?
[04:10:37] <ww1986> basically the Russian intelligence agencies have been building networks globally since 1926
[04:10:48] <Guest54> yes, that may be, but why you.
[04:11:05] <ww1986> the most important section of this effort is based to the so called "S-group"  or whatever it's called exactly which is the illegal espionage side of KGB and GRU
[04:11:27] <ww1986> where the agents would assume a false identity of a foreigner, then move to another country, live as an ordinary citizen ,and recruit a ring of contacts from the locals
[04:11:35] <Guest14> :D
[04:11:37] <ww1986> this activity has been taking place for 96 years now
[04:11:38] <NiLon> I mean there are spies of every country in any given country but they generally only target high value people
[04:12:02] <Guest14> he is the chosen one
[04:12:08] <NiLon> and not sure if limiting access is that good for spying. After all isn't the point of gathering intel
[04:12:13] <ww1986> the first prominent defector to inform the west about this activity, was Oleg Gordievsky, who defeted to the Great-Britain
[04:12:30] <Guest54> This person is so highly valued that they use thousands of trolls to bully him on the internet and games.
[04:12:40] <seifeslimene> ww1986 defeated not defeted
[04:12:51] <Guest14> Ukraine is only a distraction
[04:12:53] <ww1986> *defected
[04:13:23] <NiLon> also DOTA has tons of russian players so if you encounter them, don't think they are there for you. It's just popular game there
[04:13:32] <ww1986> in addition to this the Russians have had their political line of espionage, where agents would become career diplomats/spies
[04:13:50] <ww1986> in our country of FInland, the counter-intelligence has almost 0 information about the illegal recruitment activities done by the Soviets
[04:14:08] <ww1986> But they have been able to document about 1/2 of the meetings between the career diplomat spies and Finnish politicians
[04:14:09] <NiLon> oh you have access to SUPO archives?
[04:14:17] <ww1986> I've read books by people who have had
[04:14:35] <Guest54> So who are in the tiitisen lista?
[04:14:39] *** Quits: Bandicoot (~bandicoot@212.58.114.93) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:14:42] <ww1986> The only conclusion that can be drawn about this is, that the only civilian-counter intelligence agency in our country is not up to date
[04:14:59] <ww1986> Tiitisen lista is most likely a distraction and pointlses. Additionalyl Tiitinen themself may have been collaborating with the Soviets
[04:15:30] <ww1986> Because of his political background in the central partys K-wing (according to Seppinen)
[04:16:19] <Guest54> Sanna Marin is most definitely a spy
[04:16:24] <ww1986> The KGB also tried to approach previous directors of the civilian-counter intelligence
[04:16:30] <ww1986> this is even on wikipedia
[04:16:45] <ww1986> and the predecessor, Valpo, notoriously fell in Soviet hands

[04:19:04] <ww1986> so as part of the online censorship effort, as I've tried to join discord servers to look for people to play dota2 with, my internet connection has been censored. Luckily though, pavel joined the #security channel here on Libera.chat, and asked for DOTA players. And even better, Ajak suggested they would try discord instead.

[04:26:23] <ww1986> Unfortunately a large part of this issue is that the civilian counterintelligence is so short staffed they don't have time for this case
[04:26:26] <jessicara> 200 rubles, sounds like even i could pay more
[04:26:36] <ww1986> I've supplied plenty of material about that to the co-intel

[04:28:30] <Guest54> There is no security here, the Intenet is russian property. Only way to avoid this is stay away from the computers.
[04:28:32] <ww1986> I tried Freedome, as it is FInnish, didn't do anything.
[04:28:36] <ww1986> :D
[04:28:57] <Guest14> He doesn't know ;D
[04:29:00] <ww1986> but more than that the Russians probably have a lot of contacts in Finnish telecom companies
[04:29:07] <ww1986> i.e. the employees themselves are a risk factor
[04:29:20] <ww1986> thus my internet connection itself is dubiously protected
[04:29:39] <Guest54> Your discord connection is't getting hijcked. Everyone just bans you from their channels for spreading russian troll propaganda.

[04:32:02] <Guest14> Imagine being so bad at videogames that you imagine worldwide conspiracy against you
[04:32:10] <ww1986> Although Gordievsky alludes to a defect in CIA's operational standards, that they're unable to process information that isn't from an unbiased objective source, I'm pretty sure there has been enough subjective material here to arrive at the correct conclusion. Although whether that is a defect can be contested as well, regardless, if one was to
[04:32:10] <ww1986> evaluate my statements, I'm pretty sure there's enough already.
[04:32:21] <Guest14> Tldr
[04:32:23] <Guest54> XD

[04:46:15] <ww1986> it's a long story, and i can't tell for certain for a single match that they're all trolls
[04:46:26] <ww1986> but I can tell over a period of matches
[04:46:28] <queue-> its like autism has just exploded itc
[04:46:37] <queue-> i dont even know where im at rn
[04:46:50] <jessicara> it's probably not much to retry joining until find who are looking for
[04:46:51] <ww1986> I'm having yogurt and berries
[04:47:02] <Guest54> play a game with him and you will see
[04:47:06] <jessicara> i remember it was impossible for anyone to hide in some games
[04:47:17] <mats1> and thats why i should be a #s +o
[04:47:21] <jessicara> could just connect to the entire server list and scan for people
[04:47:23] <mats1> vote for me
[04:47:39] <queue-> i just vote for better chats
[04:48:10] <ww1986> sometimes it has been fairly obvious though

[22:26:27] <jenia__> Can someone please tell me, why is it considered that the salt - in an password hashing architecture - can be store as plain text and does not really need to be protected? Won't an attacked be able to recalculate their rainbow tables with the salt for all their pre-calculated password hashes and be able to match the salted password with the new salted rainbow table entries?
[22:27:03] <tpr> salt or nonce is used to protect against precomputed rainbow tables
[22:27:10] *** JMatrix36[m] is now known as Techone[m]
[22:27:46] <tpr> having every password salted with a unique salt, it will force the attacker to brute force them all separately

[22:29:28] <jenia__> why brute force? Ok. Suppose I calculated the hashes for all common password for example. Now I get access to the database and find that hashes on the victims and their salts. All I need to do then, is to re-compute my table with every salt in the victims database and now I can match the victims passwords to my new rainbow tables

[22:31:07] <jenia__> tpr: not every possible salt. Only those salts that are in the victim's database
[22:31:16] <tpr> well, if you know the salt, you can create a rainbow table for that single salt and store it for future uses. but the point is that the salts are random, you would need to generate as many tables as there are salts
[22:31:19] <jenia__> like 10^6 salts for example.
[22:31:31] <jenia__> or at least, a subset of them.

[22:31:49] <tpr> well, it's in principle just bruteforcing the passwords one by one then, if you cannot reuse the table for other passwords
[22:32:22] <jenia__> hummm ok
[22:32:43] <jenia__> is there a way to hash the salts themselves? lol
[22:32:45] <jenia__> haha

[22:35:53] <tpr> well, you need to have the original salt in some form in order to verify if the hash matches the one generated using it
[22:36:06] *** Quits: Czernobog (~Czernobog@user/czernobog) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[22:36:30] <tpr> when you use salt, you simply do a comparison akin to H(salt + <user input>) == <stored password>
[22:37:47] <newsense> Just brute each hash individually. Rainbow table + salts isn't worth it
[22:39:25] <tpr> yeah, if you are not using weak salts or sharing them across sites, it makes no sense to create rainbow tables as you are not going to be able to reuse them
[22:39:50] <tpr> also, the tables themselves will also cost space for nothing
