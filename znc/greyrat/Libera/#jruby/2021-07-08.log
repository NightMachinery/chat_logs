[00:04:55] <headius> ok I might only be able to add this test on master because kares fixed up the jruby suite to pass on Windows there
[00:05:00] <headius> it does not even boot on 9.2
[00:05:16] <headius>  I will confirm the behavior in this test works and then merge and do a separate push for a master test
[00:39:34] <headius> all merged to master
[00:58:05] <headius> enebo: FYI https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6747
[00:58:16] <headius> 6732 can't be fixed without updating the files but they keep diverging and we should be sourcing them from the gem anyway
[00:58:21] <headius> this will align FFI on 9.2 with master
[00:58:26] <headius> bbiab
[02:47:54] <headius> enebo: hit a snag with that PR because the ffi.rb from the gem only loads on 9.3+
[02:48:43] <headius> so we need to decide whether we want to do this backport in 9.2.20 or just manually patch the local copy of FFI to fix #6732. If we want the full backport we will need to get an ffi gem released that will load properly

[19:55:52] <headius> Good morning
[21:33:43] <headius> enebo: thoughts on that FFI backport?
[21:34:18] <headius> if we want to commit to fully backporting, to align 9.2 with current FFI and allow the ruby sources to be gem-upgraded, we need to have larskanis push a release
[22:15:31] <enebo[m]> headius: you landed it already right?
[22:15:51] <headius> no
[22:15:59] <enebo[m]> headius: I think it is ok I guess.  We will be on a multi-release train and ffi has gotten quite ab it of attention this year
[22:16:08] <headius> I can't land it because it doesn't run tests right until the FFI gem loads right
[22:16:45] <headius> I asked larskanis to do a prerelease that supports 9.2.20 so we can try it out... we can decide if it goes in that release or 9.2.21 once it is green
[22:18:21] <enebo[m]> oh ok
[22:18:34] <enebo[m]> sorry I missed the "hit a snag" comment above
[22:19:56] <enebo[m]> headius: I somehow thought you were asking about something which landed but I think I misread the PR.  Seems like if the 9.2 loading is fixed we can land and evlauate if we find problems?  ffi is a strange library in that it is probably used in many more ways than we have tests for
[22:20:24] <enebo[m]> with that said I am not as worried about that as much as massive changes to shelllauncher
[22:20:35] <enebo[m]> but we need to fix problems too
[22:20:47] <enebo[m]> some risk is unavoidable
[22:21:09] <headius> 9.2 loading is not fixed because the fix is in FFI ruby sources
[22:21:23] <headius> so we either hand-patch those sources again or bite the bullet and get the build using the gem
[22:21:28] <enebo[m]> MONKEY PATCH
[22:21:47] <enebo[m]> I am kidding
[22:21:50] <headius> ShellLauncher gutting will be post 9.3
[22:22:02] <headius> what's another round of hacks among friends
[22:22:16] <enebo[m]> as you said we can manually patch but then we lose the upgrade path unless next ffi release fixes it
[22:22:43] <headius> we have been upgrading manually up until 9.3, and then I finally aligned our ext with the gem and started using the stock rb files
[22:22:57] <headius> but it has gotten harder because the changes get a little bigger each time
[22:23:07] <headius> and we can't really say we ship FFI version X compatible logic
[22:23:26] <enebo[m]> yeah.  so two more reasons to get ffi 9.2 capable
[22:23:28] <headius> if we get that prerelease gem I will finish the PR and we can see how drastic it is
[22:23:56] <headius> most of the changes were not big but in a few cases Java classes were deleted in favor of newer pure-Ruby versions... so that is a larger risk
[22:24:00] <enebo[m]> I guess if we can "if" then we try and see if we can break something after that
[22:24:00] <headius> but it is working on master for many months
[22:24:39] <enebo[m]> yeah I guess I never know what that means since it has no official release but we know it works enough for the stuff we test (and some people are definitely playing with master)
[22:25:31] <headius> and if future fixes come into gem's ruby sources 9.2.x users will be able to get them
[22:26:51] <enebo[m]> yeah
