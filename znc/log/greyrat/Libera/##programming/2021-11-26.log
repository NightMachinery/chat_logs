[00:00:28] <pyzozord> there is a legend / meme that every time you mention this game someone installs it
[00:01:01] <mrig> I may have to look it up and get a copy, likely would run on wine ok.
[00:01:13] <mrig> not played a decent game in ages.
[00:01:23] <user51> yes, it runs great on wine
[00:01:37] <user51> i played it in 2015
[00:01:37] <pyzozord> yes it should run well, it's old game and well loved
[00:01:50] <user51> i was drunk as hell at the time
[00:01:51] <mrig> heh, just to maintain the legend of course.
[00:02:00] <user51> pretty good memory

[01:10:38] <pyzozord> the spec it the img's src attribute "The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor scripted."

[01:14:08] <jkk> kveroneau,  it is very important to have clean clothes on :)
[01:14:42] <pyzozord> nah, i think it needs to resemble url

[02:07:55] <flakland> a vaccine that doesn't offer immunity is not a vaccine at ll
[02:07:57] <flakland> at all.
[02:08:09] <d3x0r> https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/math/mathSphereDecay gravitation curves aren't really such cooky things... but then I considered space is more dense towards gravity and receeds to it's non-offset bias with distance (which is from more to less ) 
[02:08:14] <PlanckWalk> Very few vaccines offer 100% immunity.

[02:08:32] <flakland> how many called vaccines only offer 90 pecent
[02:08:33] <jkk> since life evolves

[02:08:44] <Pickchea> Literally just look it up.
[02:08:44] <PlanckWalk> Actually I suppose I should say that *none* offer 100% immunity.
[02:08:45] <d3x0r> but the gravity delta from physics ends up being negative - or it's looked at as potential energy which increases with distance instead of vice versa
[02:08:50] <flakland> why don't they call it a flu vaccine 
[02:09:01] <PlanckWalk> Because it isn't.
[02:09:05] <Pickchea> flakland, because corona viruses are not flue viruses?

[02:09:36] <nomagno> But clearly distinct virus types
[02:09:41] <flakland> is 90% efficacy considered "immunity" ?\

[02:10:09] <PlanckWalk> There are many measures of efficacy
[02:10:16] <flakland> depends on the  compnay that sells the vaccine

[02:25:53] <cool6502> PlanckWalk: maybe a subset of people are closed minded. being confrontational helps keep people closed minded. it's just nice to not have to talk about controversial politics in stem-themed chatrooms
[02:26:09] <Sqaure> Pickchea, thats either a joke or real. Never heard the term polynomial time. Is that better than exponential time? 
[02:26:09] <apotheon> What does pointing out the channel topic have to do with not being aware of something?
[02:27:02] <PlanckWalk> Polynomial time = there exists a polynomial P such that the runtime of the algorithm as a function of input length n is less than P(n)
[02:27:04] <jkk> apotheon, my reply would illuminate this matter however he can figure it out himself X
[02:27:07] <Pickchea> jkk, come to think of it, you're right! I hate how my government forces me to drive sober and not carry hand grenades (for self defence!!) in public. Also they force me not to hit my child! That's insane, how many freedoms will they take from me??
[02:27:27] <jinsun> Sqaure: you haven't heard of P vs NP?
[02:27:27] <cool6502> Square: i think polynomial and non-polynomial are also commonly known as P and NP. NP being harder than P. someone correct me if thats wrong
[02:27:34] <PlanckWalk> And yes, polynomial time is less than exponential time
[02:27:42] <PlanckWalk> NP = nondeterministic polynomial

[02:30:58] <arahael> apotheon: As with many things in jargon and language. :)
[02:31:18] <apotheon> The point is that there's a long tradition of "PM" in IRC.

[05:34:53] <Sqaure> What platform was it made for?
[05:35:02] <CoJaBo> There's a "Super Mario 64 Unofficial PC Port", dunno if that's it tho
[05:35:37] <kveroneau> Like big developers like Rockstar and Nintendo should put up bounty boards of such, where fans could submit their versions of a remake, and if the company loves it, they can just buy it from the developer that submitted it, and tell all the others to delete theirs.  At least that way we might get better quality remakes.
[05:36:08] <kveroneau> Square, most of them are on PC using the Unreal engine.
[05:36:13] <CoJaBo> "Super Mario 64 HD" seems to be it, mentions it's cancelled due to Nintendo
[05:36:26] <kveroneau> That could be the one.
[05:36:31] <CoJaBo> So yeh, still exists somewhere
[05:37:29] <kveroneau> There was a cool Metroid remake a fan made awhile back because Nintendo released their less than stellar remake of the same game of their own. :(

[05:38:27] <CoJaBo> Didn't that happen with RunEscape too recently?
[05:38:27] <kveroneau> Fan remakes always tend to be much better these days than official ones, only because of how accessible modern engines and toolsets have become.
[05:38:59] <kveroneau> Not sure how a single dev can do a better job than 10 devs at a company being paid.
[05:39:15] <Sqaure> "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link" should be my best game experience I ever had (taking into account age + previous exposure). I sneaked up after my parents put me to bed just to play it
[05:39:32] <CoJaBo> kveroneau: Competence
[05:39:33] <kveroneau> Never heard of RunEscape, I'll need to look that up.
[05:40:06] <CoJaBo> Never assume people hired by a company were hired because they were skilled lol
[05:40:12] <kveroneau> Sqaure, Zelda II is highly underrated imo and I've played every Zelda game(probably), the CD-i ones are the exception there.
[05:40:38] <kveroneau> CoJaBo so true
[05:41:20] <Sqaure> kveroneau, i lowed how items unlocked parts of the world. 
[05:41:22] <kveroneau> With that said, I recently bought one of those Zelda Game & Watch collectable things recently.  It comes with the original, Zelda 2, and the gameboy one on it.
[05:41:58] <kveroneau> Sqaure, that is actually true to almost every Zelda game, except the last one, Breath of the Wild, and I really love that aspect too of a Zelda game.
[05:42:03] *** Joins: temy (~tem@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9)
[05:42:37] <kveroneau> Link's Awakening from Gameboy is probably one of the best examples of how items open up the game's world as you collect more.
[05:42:56] <kveroneau> Great game design imo
[05:43:07] <Sqaure> I had n64 zelda III. That was quite a boring / flat experience. Also one I played on Gameboy was just meh
[05:43:32] <kveroneau> Oh?  The gameboy one is probably one of my favorites in the series.
[05:44:06] <Sqaure> oh. Maybe theres more than one. GBA was the one i played on
[05:44:19] <kveroneau> Oh, that one was waaaay to short.
[05:44:37] <kveroneau> And way too much dialogue at times.
[05:44:58] <kveroneau> Link's Awakening is much more puzzle and action packed, and the items are much more interesting.
[05:46:12] <kveroneau> If you see a Zelda Game & Watch when you are at the store next, highly recommend picking one up.  It does have Zelda II, which also includes the Japanese version of that game which plays much more differently than I expected, and also has Link's Awakening on it.
[05:47:11] <Sqaure> its wierd. Every game ive played ive measured against Zelda II. I realize age / exposure made me overvalue that game. But yeah, cant beat nostalgia. =D
[05:47:19] <arahael> CoJaBo: I'd say "Competence" is only part of the issue.  Another part of of the issue are any business rules or restrictions.  I've noticed that the 10x developers, so to speak, tend to play hard and fast with the rules, often skipping or flat out ignoring criteria that were previously regarded as absolutely important.
[05:47:40] <arahael> CoJaBo: Or maybe they were given the requiremetns in a different way.  Regardless, I'd say "competence" is not even close to the whole story.
[05:48:03] <kveroneau> There's even an easter egg in these versions of the game where if you hold down the 'A' button on the file select screen for 5 seconds on a new file, it will unlock a lot of stuff making the experience a bit easier, great way to introduce peope who may not want to try Zelda II because of it's sheer difficulty.
[05:48:04] <Sqaure> kveroneau, ive heard good things about Ocarina of Time and Windwaker. Would like to try ports / re-release of those
[05:48:26] <arahael> Another example are being amazed with how fast and good young devs are.  But people have been disappointed when I did the same thing because I took a lot longer doing it or even stated that I couldn't do it - because I didn't want to *maintain* the crappy solution.
[05:49:09] <arahael> But sure. I can hack together a solution that works for people as fast as you can say "please", but if you want me to maintain it, that's a whole different kettle.
[05:49:32] * kveroneau says please.
[05:50:07] <kveroneau> Sqaure, the HD remaster of Wind Waker on Wii U was actually really well done.
[05:50:53] <kveroneau> It also has a "Hero Mode" if you crave additional challenge. :)
[05:51:22] <arahael> kveroneau: Here's this paint splash. It's a valid perl implementation for your task.

[09:44:02] <hnOsmium0001[m]> now I think about it, managed languages has the huge advantage of not having to isolate parts of your program into separate processes, so that the UI/main part doens't die when one part of your program crashes
[09:44:16] <hnOsmium0001[m]> you can just throw a try{}catch{} around critial places and restart everything if it fails
[09:45:31] <plantman> that's awesome :)

[17:16:59] <[itchyjunk]> oh webassembly is not hand written?
[17:17:02] <[itchyjunk]> what's the point then?
[17:17:46] <sjmulder> it can be much faster than JavaScript, and low level languages can be compiled to it
[17:17:47] <MrMobius> so that you can write web programs in languages other than javascript
[17:17:53] *** jinsun__ is now known as jinsun

[17:18:40] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see
[17:18:44] <MrMobius> javascript gets optimized with a jit system that can be really fast, so people were making compilers that produce javascript that is then transformed into assembly by the jit at run time. webassembly is the same but much more efficient

[18:42:40] <d3x0r> mobidrop I'm not sure it's 'want to control' it's 'people think we should be controlling this'  ... I mean look how the MSM went after trump for being lasai faire about it.  
[18:43:00] <d3x0r> I'm more of the opinion we should make people take care of themselves - if they don't care why should they be forced to?
[18:43:01] <apotheon> cool6502: "Truth" being subjective is a distraction tactic, trying to remove a term that could otherwise be used to productively discuss something.
[18:43:05] <kennyd> apotheon, fuck off and google it yourself. FDA sending an open letter to veterinarians should have been proof enough if you were arguing in good faith
[18:43:16] <cool6502> mobidrop: i feel its not comprehensive to assume its just for controlling others. maybe in a sense they believed what they were doing is right. but there was already evidence some of those substances can be useful for medicinal purposes. maybe we can equate it to rule-making thousands of years ago, trying to be safe rather than sorry, even if not accurate
[18:43:36] <apotheon> kennyd: I skimmed a bit and it looks like it's a letter warning veterinarians to not recommend it.
[18:43:37] <d3x0r> we're supposed to care about our fellow humans
[18:43:47] <pyzozord> Maybe some truths are, but I personally don't believe we as a civilization have the means to reach the real truth, so what I said I consider to be a good heuristic to help keep the conversation great
[18:43:49] <apotheon> kennyd: That's the the same as a statement that people are asking veterinarians to *prescribe* it.
[18:44:02] <apotheon> The word "prescribe" in this context has a specific meaning.
[18:44:45] <apotheon> kennyd: If the letter doesn't say the thing you claim, I don't see how it's proof of what you claim.
[18:44:54] <mobidrop> cool6502, they're fine with people getting fat and unhealthy + smoking + alcohol
[18:45:01] <kennyd> apotheon, ok, I'll pretend you're not deliberately playing dumb.. who do you think gives humans animal ivermectin?
[18:45:25] <d3x0r> or who took it?
[18:45:47] <apotheon> kennyd: people who go to livestock feed stores and buy it as an off-the-shelf item
[18:45:48] <mobidrop> there have been humans who took horse ivermectin but with reduced dosage
[18:46:03] <apotheon> In the US, you don't need a prescription to buy ivermectin for livestock.
[18:46:16] <apotheon> You only need a prescription to buy it for humans.
[18:46:28] <cool6502> mobidrop: yeah, and thats partly why things are changing with other things becoming legalized, the evidence keeps stacking up and public opinion changes enough that politicians arent scared to be booted if they show support
[18:46:46] <xsperry> apotheon, I am pretty sure that depends on the state
[18:47:06] <mobidrop> cool6502, there is also a huge conflict of interest with vaccines: emergency usage of the experimental vaccines hinges on the fact that there is no alternative treatment
[18:47:31] <mobidrop> cool6502, so ivermectin being allowed and found as an effective treatment wouldn't be too good for the vaccine program
[18:47:34] <apotheon> xsperry: Oh?  That's interesting, if so.

[18:50:25] <apotheon> In my experience, though, rural types -- ranchers, farmers, their friends, et cetera -- semi-often use (carefully selected) animal medicines that are prescription-only for humans but not for animals, because it's much cheaper.  In practice, it doesn't seem to result in negative effects.  Mostly, things made for horses are likely to have higher standards for quality than for other lifestock, too,
[18:50:31] <apotheon> because horse people *LOSE THEIR SHIT* if something happens to their horses.

[18:55:38] <mobidrop> DPA, sounds reasonable, but only covid related cases should be refused then, not a broken leg unvaxxed
[18:55:40] <apotheon> That's not what I believe, per se, but it's an interesting thought experiment.
[18:56:00] <DPA> mobidrop: Agreed

[18:57:29] <apotheon> I'd say that those who are being refused treatment by pro-vaccine establishments should be allowed to use whatever treatment they think appropriate, though, given the law as it stood before all this insanity.
[18:58:04] <mobidrop> yeah don't outlaw ivermectin and restrict hospital care for unvaxxed so society can go on
[18:58:27] <apotheon> The main opposition to ivermectin seems to be that it's not clinically shown to be effective, so if you're willing to let all those people die you should be willing to let them make experimental subjects of themselves.

[19:16:22] <InPhase> neural damage.
[19:16:48] <apotheon> It then turned out that the way patches were pushed out they could be applied in reverse order, in which case the patch that was supposed to be second would be partly undone by the patch that was supposed to be first.

[19:23:44] <apotheon> On that note, I recommend trying to get shell scripts working with #!/bin/sh instead of relying on a Bash shebang line, to improve portability (though when Bash provides sh, it can still cause portability issues).
[19:23:52] <KillerWasp> also you must use rm "${FILE}".cpp for get some spaces in the file
[19:24:11] <KillerWasp> or rm "${FILE}.cpp"
[19:24:23] <apotheon> Yeah, double-quoting is probably a good idea.

[19:32:06] <ThePhilgrim> I've made a php script that uses PHPMailer to send emails from my html contact form to my email. I have set it up with the smtp server from my shared hosting. The POST request works, and the PHPMailer script works fine with a fake smtp server. So the question: Is it reasonable that the script using the real smtp server doesn't work unless the website files are uploaded to the hosting platform?

[19:32:28] <KillerWasp> changing the subject to a more ontopic one. I'm tired of being rejected on source code patches making excuses for anything. So I was thinking of selling the patches to the common people who may be more interested in having their machine work well.

[19:35:48] <InPhase> KillerWasp: Usually there is a selectivity about contributions, but typically these are worked out with engagement and discussion.  Have you tried community engagement about things, to make sure your approach to fixing things in a project does not conflict with some other goal and isn't implemented in some way that clashes with broader design principles?

[19:38:51] <InPhase> KillerWasp: In OpenSCAD most of the small patches just "fixing" something get accepted if they're not buggy in some way.  It's feature patches that sometimes get rejected, but almost all of them end up integrated if they happened as part of engaged discussion.  Usually those discussions redirect the approach a little bit so that there's a bit more coherence in the planned features.  New contributers 
[19:38:57] <InPhase> often don't know how their feature would intersect with other aspects of the project, or don't know all the intentional design philosophies.

[19:40:31] <InPhase> apotheon: I know how to sh/awk, but that's just terrible compared to Python for anything complicated.

[19:42:29] <InPhase> Payam: Think about what's actually done for the job itself, and try to select some things that are structurally like the work actually done for the job.  This is more valuable for you, and might also be easier to think of.

[21:39:29] <RedNifre> With the spreadsheet, the development process was like this: 1. Think about it 2. Write the code.
[21:39:32] <KillerWasp> RedNifreɁ in the lo calc, each time that you change the values, any other cell that have '=' calculation with the modified cell, refresh and show the calculation.
[21:40:18] <KillerWasp> i mean if the calculation math are saved in the cell.
[21:40:22] <RedNifre> Whereas with modern software, it's usually 1. Think about it 2. Look for existing software/libraries 3. Write some code 4. Figure out what these strange error messages mean 5. Google it 6. Try random suggestions until it works ...
[21:41:20] <RedNifre> KillerWasp: Yes, I assume it uses some sort of dependency graph between cells. I thought about it, but "Recalculate everything until no number changes any more" was easier to implement and gets the job done.
[21:41:41] <RedNifre> I mean, I currently only use 18 cells anyway and a refresh takes just 1 second.

[23:35:59] <KillerWasp> which is a lie, because I am using firefox, and firefox is from google, how can they not recognize it? it is not an excuse to block my mail either.

[23:52:10] <jkk> flakland, exist as a code yes
[23:52:20] <jkk> and hello
[23:52:31] <flakland> i know for sure safari would exist without the ten billion a year from google, but not so sure about firefox
[23:52:46] <jkk> flakland, well we all know how things are
[23:52:54] <pyzozord> why do they keep mozilla alive
[23:53:05] <jkk> pyzozord, it is obvious 
[23:53:09] <flakland> to avoid catching a case

[23:53:33] <deniska> or was it early 00's?
[23:53:39] <vdamewood> monopoly is an oxymoron. Mono means one, poly means many.
[23:53:51] <jkk> poly is better

[23:55:36] <jkk> well I am intested :P
[23:55:46] <pyzozord> well my feeling was "they keep them alive because letting them die would make google look bad"
[23:55:50] <vdamewood> deniska: How disappointing. It just comes from a greek word for foolish.
[23:55:56] <pyzozord> which was kind of absurd
