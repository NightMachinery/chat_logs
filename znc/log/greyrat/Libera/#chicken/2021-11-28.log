[16:15:19] *** Joins: sandra (~snan@chicken/contributor/snan)
[16:15:46] <sandra> Can someone on the recent release please tell me the value of the following expression?
[16:15:46] <sandra> (import (chicken irregex))
[16:15:46] <sandra> (eq?
[16:15:46] <sandra>  (not (not (irregex-search '(: bol eol) "")))
[16:15:46] <sandra>  (equal? "foo" (irregex-replace/all '(: bol eol) "" "foo")))
[16:16:36] <sandra> Also https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/bol-eol.txt here in case it's hard to paste from IRC
[16:18:14] <sandra> IIRC this issue was fixed and I keep forgetting
[16:18:36] <mario-goulart> That's #f in 5.3.0.
[16:18:54] <sandra> OK, thank you, Mario. That might be a bug, then
[16:19:07] <mario-goulart> yw
[16:21:53] <mario-goulart> I'd expect (irregex-replace/all '(: bol eol) "" "foo") to return "foo".
[16:22:15] <sandra> https://github.com/ashinn/irregex/issues/29
[16:22:47] <sandra> Instead, does it return "" on 5.3.0?
[16:23:00] <mario-goulart> yes
[16:23:35] <sandra> My "upgrade" to Debian Bullseye downgraded my Chicken to 5.2.0. And that's gonna be the LTS for a while
[16:23:53] <mario-goulart> !
[16:24:09] <sandra> I should have a separate 5.3.0 in a chroot or something just to test things
[16:24:30] <sandra> But all my programming spoons need to go towards day job♥
[16:26:09] <mario-goulart> I see, understandable.  Just want to point out that building CHICKEN from sources is very easy and pretty much dependency-less.
[16:27:05] <sandra> Installing it on Debian is the difficult part. We've talked about this many times though
[16:27:43] <sandra> But having a 5.3.0 (and corresponding set of eggs) in its own li'l corner, not in $PATH, is probably a good idea
[16:28:37] <mario-goulart> Out of curiosity, what's difficult about installing CHICKEN on Debian?
[16:29:03] <sandra> It clobbers /usr
[16:30:11] <sandra> Easiest way I've found is to download the deb package from the previous release, put the new Chicken release in there, mod some things around, and compile it
[16:30:25] <sandra> Or I could apt pin or some other shenanigans
[16:30:36] <mario-goulart> What does it meant to clobber /usr?  The degault installation prefix is /usr/local, and that can be easily changed by setting PREFIX when calling make.
[16:30:44] <mario-goulart> s/meant/mean/
[16:30:51] <sandra> Oh, I mean, clobbers /usr/local then
[16:31:19] <mario-goulart> The build system has to install files somewhere. :-)
[16:31:48] <sandra> The difficult part specifically with Chicken is how the installation destination directory hard-codes stuff where it expects to later find the running installation.
[16:32:17] <mario-goulart> Indeed, but the CHICKEN binaries from Debian are exactly like that too.
[16:32:28] <sandra> So you can't install to a temporary destination and then from there use a package manager to move the files over to its running destination.
[16:32:43] <sandra> Right, and they have tons of shenanigans in order to do that properly. Fakeroots and whatnot
[16:32:53] <sandra> It's way over my head
[16:37:27] <sandra> Non-clobbering is when the installed files are being tracked by the package system. So you can apt remove it ♥
[16:37:27] <sandra> Of course, then all the eggs are gonna be clobbering... Luckily chicken-uninstall works. I love how in Ruby they have a way to turn ruby gems into debs. That's... not easy to make, though. An egg-to-deb facility would be pretty awesome.♥
[16:38:13] <mario-goulart> re: "you can't install to a temporary destination..." It is certainly possible, but a little bit more convoluted.  In most cases it's just not necessary.
[16:40:03] <mario-goulart> I just use http://parenteses.org/mario/misc/installing-chicken.txt
[16:41:21] <sandra> And then you have to rely on Chicken's own facilities to uninstall it, right?
[16:42:38] <mario-goulart> I just `rm -rf $HOME/local/chicken-5.3.0` in that case.
[16:44:03] <mario-goulart> Alternating between versions is also a piece of cake if you have a symlink in your $PATH.  You just reroute the symlink.
[16:45:44] <sandra> Interesting♥. Where do the installed eggs go with these alternating versions shenanigans?

[16:49:07] <mario-goulart> Everything goes under PREFIX.
[16:51:52] <sandra> Thank you. OK, so setting up a separate 5.3.0 for testing purps doesn't sound too hard. There are featuers in my libraries that I'm holding off on until 5.3.0 sees a wider (Debian stable) release, but, as I find bugs it's good to check (and maybe even fix) them in the newest version, not my dusty old nineteen seventies version.

[16:58:34] <sandra> Someone keeps trying to log into my nick
[16:59:30] <sandra> They wanna live the rest of their lives in a tug of war over the nick that I registered as soon as libera opened its doors
[17:00:17] <amazigh> somewhat funny tho
[17:00:35] <sandra> It's annoying since they keep triggering my nick highlighter
[17:01:00] <sandra> And, since I was away for a few weeks without having set the enforce thing on with NickServ, they were using it for a while
[17:01:13] <sandra> Not sure in what channels
[17:02:44] <sandra> I don't know who they are while they could easily contact me since they know my nick (duh)
[17:03:05] <sandra> Not that I wanna talk to them, I just want them to give up
[17:05:28] <amazigh> sudo adduser --global sandra && sudo password
[17:05:48] <sandra> I went and set enforce on at oftc and tilde too (well, it's called kill, rather than enforce, on tilde)
[17:06:00] <sandra> Tilde's NickServ is a bit... Uh...
[17:07:25] <sandra> --global ♥
[17:10:09] <sandra> It's a Colombian ip
[17:11:16] *** sandra is now known as snan
[17:21:34] <snan> So the enforce thing is pretty useless since they're logged into Sandra right now!
[17:21:38] <snan> Not in any channels though?
[17:24:21] <amazigh> how would you know?
[17:24:31] <amazigh>  /whois only tells you the shared channel
[17:24:42] <amazigh> the channels you are both in
[17:24:43] <snan> Oh! I didn't know that limitation of /whois
[17:24:51] <snan> That's a good limitation actually
[17:26:03] *** snan is now known as sandra
[17:28:33] <amazigh> on liberachat it is limited like that
[17:28:49] <amazigh> other irc network display all the channels they are in
[17:29:48] <sandra> That's kind of a bad UX from a principle of surprise perspective
