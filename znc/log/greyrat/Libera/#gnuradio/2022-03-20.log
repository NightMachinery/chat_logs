[21:37:59] <bkerler[m]> yes. the weird thing is : the viterbi combined module is in the gui, but you can't run it as it also hasn't been updated as it seems
[21:38:38] <bkerler[m]> so it looks like as if the viterbi and trellis module is broken in >= 3.9 and many plugins can't be ported
[21:45:50] <miek> it looks like the bindings are missing for viterbi_combined_xx, i'd guess that something similar to this: https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/commit/e1d49194882e70cc1637ddeb491a41a86b58b8da#diff-d7cc9273588d3e801e9e1c7400177278e0310b02c807d76efbbbb383b84e5c55 needs to be added to viterbi_combined_python.cc

I got a cmake error about the version and tried changing it to 3.10 in CMakeLists, but cmake is still complaining. The porting guide says modtool will have no trouble interpreting blocks from 3.9. Is there a modtool function to pull in a current OOT and reformat for 3.10?
[22:02:12] <bkerler[m]> miek: Thanks, I will write an issue as this will break many modules.

[22:47:13] <bkerler[m]> I didn't test the modules, but if it worked for 3.9 it should just work with minor mods for 3.10/3.11 as well
[22:47:50] <muaddib[m]> right, that was my understanding as well and my question was related to cmake output. trying to narrow down those 'minor mods'
[22:48:09] <muaddib[m]> as i am not very familiar with cmake 
[22:48:37] <muaddib[m]> but if it builds fine for you on 3.10 and the blocks show up in GRC, i'll check my environment again. 
[22:48:42] <bkerler[m]> yeah .. most of the time there are issues with boost to std conversion or yml category, or with pdu socket to network conversion
[22:48:49] <bkerler[m]> let me check for the blocks
