[00:13:35] <wroathe> merpnderp: Ok, the general idea behind OIDC is that clients, and the scripts that run on clients, are not to be trusted, and so rather than letting that client deal with handling the user's credentials, OIDC forces you to redirect to (or display in a popup window) the authorization server, which is considered to be trusted. The auth server prompts the user and asks if the claims that the application
[00:13:41] <wroathe> says it needs are ok, and then asks the user for their username/password. After the user assents, the auth server then redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code that the client can use to request a short-lived temporary access token. That access token is the fundamental unit that gives that authorizes the client to access resources that belong to the user (like the API you're
[00:13:47] <wroathe> talking about)
[00:13:59] <wroathe> merpnderp: And that access token can contain whatever information about the user you want, including their email address
[00:14:48] <wroathe> merpnderp: Or it can contain just the identifier for the user, and you can use that to look up the email address from wherever.
[00:15:49] <merpnderp> wroathe: so as long as I have the other team set up our client so that the access token contains the email address of the user, I shouldn't need my webapi to query the resource server.
[00:15:50] <wroathe> merpnderp: So your web API will receive that access token as input, and use it to make authorization decisions about whether or not the user has access to the resources their trying to access
[00:16:10] <wroathe> merpnderp: From the point of view of your SPA, your web API _IS_ the resource server
[00:16:25] <wroathe> merpnderp: If the web API endpoints with protected user resources
[00:16:25] <merpnderp> wroathe: No, I don't control the openId connect server. That's another team's.
[00:16:40] <wroathe> merpnderp: Yup. Understood. I think you're not following :P
[00:16:48] <merpnderp> wroathe: I'm definitely not
[00:16:59] <wroathe> merpnderp: The "resource server" is the server that contains the protected resources your application would like to access
[00:17:01] <merpnderp> lol, but if my webapi can hit the resource server with the access token, then I think I'm good.
[00:17:10] <merpnderp> okay, so that's my webapi.
[00:17:17] <merpnderp> But I need to know that the user is who they say they are.
[00:17:30] <wroathe> merpnderp: Yup, and that's what the access token is for
[00:17:51] <wroathe> merpnderp: The web api will receive the access token, and then determine if it has an appropriate scope to access the resource
[00:17:57] *** Joins: eck0 (~Android@047-007-119-133.res.spectrum.com)
[00:18:11] <merpnderp> wroathe: by making api calls against the openid connect server?
[00:18:14] <wroathe> merpnderp: The access token is proof that at some point the user authenticated with the "authorization server" (OIDC server)
[00:18:43] <wroathe> merpnderp: It could. There's a couple of ways to do it. You'll have to ask your OIDC team how they recommend you handle authorization once you've got the access token
[00:18:50] <wroathe> merpnderp: https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow
[00:19:20] <wroathe> merpnderp: step 9 is when your "Regular Web App" (SPA), calls your web api with the access token
[00:19:26] <merpnderp> wroathe: whew, I've made more progress in the last 2 minutes than the last 2 days :D
[00:19:37] <wroathe> merpnderp: "Your API" is your SPA's web api

[00:20:55] <merpnderp> That last bit should be the exact same.
[00:21:00] <wroathe> merpnderp: And remember that authentication and authorization are different concerns
[00:21:03] <wroathe> merpnderp: Yes
[00:21:25] <wroathe> merpnderp: And you can see a PKCE diagram in that earlier link I gave you. PKCE happens during the _authentication_ piece of the flow, and not during the _authorization_ piece of the flow
[00:21:25] <merpnderp> wroathe: Thanks.
[00:21:43] <merpnderp> Right, yeah, I'm pretty solid on the two phases.
[00:21:44] <wroathe> merpnderp: The _authorization_ piece of the flow is simply steps 9 and 10 on repeat
[00:21:59] <merpnderp> wroathe: Yeah, that's the part I wasn't sure how to handle.
[00:21:59] <wroathe> merpnderp: (even though the endpoint to the OIDC server is confusingly called /authorize)
[00:22:07] <merpnderp> wroathe: thank you so much.
[00:22:22] <wroathe> merpnderp: Different teams and different organizations have different standards
[00:23:30] <wroathe> merpnderp: The access token typically contains all of the scope information the resource server will need to make authorization decisions, and using it as such is often referred to as using a "stateless" token or "stateless" authorization
[00:23:46] <wroathe> merpnderp: Because authorizing the request with the access token doesn't depend on any backend state (like a database query, or another backend web api call)
[00:24:06] <wroathe> merpnderp: This has the drawback that there's no way to revoke an access token before it's time is expired
[00:24:51] <wroathe> merpnderp: So in some cases organizations are required to maintain session-like state about what tokens have been revoked, and the authorization server is then forced to make a web api call or a database lookup to determine that the token is still valid
[00:25:15] <wroathe> merpnderp: It's a performance security tradeoff, and your OIDC team will typically have guidance and standards published for what they expect of the application teams.

[00:28:08] <merpnderp> wroathe: so PKCE doesn't do auth tokens?
[00:28:25] <wroathe> merpnderp: PKCE is an extra security measure around the authentication piece of the flow

[00:36:37] <merpnderp> Lots of info to absorb.
[00:39:30] <wroathe> merpnderp: What I would do, if I were you, would be to read some of the oauth 2.0 and OIDC specs, and put a special emphasis on understanding the terminology they use to refer to the various parties, and then get a sheet of paper and write down the list parties in your setup and use the terms the standards use to label them
[00:40:04] <wroathe> merpnderp: things like authorization server, resource server, client, relying party, openid provider
[00:40:35] <merpnderp> wroathe: that's a really good idea.
[00:40:55] <merpnderp> Cause there's a lot of jargon in the specs.
[00:41:32] <wroathe> merpnderp: For instance, your SPA would be an example of a "Client" or a "Relying Party" depending on which spec you're looking at
[00:41:52] <wroathe> merpnderp: That should give you a push in the right direction. Good luck!

[01:42:20] <cth> we have a store... object, which is an array and an object at the same time
[01:42:32] <cth> I would say it's malformed, but JS lets you do it.
[01:42:33] <cth> how come?
[01:43:49] <cth> so I can do store[0] at the same time as store.list_name
[01:44:08] <GreenJello> arrays are objects, and you can add arbitrary properties to objects
[01:44:22] <GreenJello> they just have additional behavior for integer keys
[01:44:32] <cth> but then how would array functions work on something like that?
[01:44:40] <cth> how would store.some() work?
[01:44:46] <GreenJello> array methods ignore other properties
[01:44:49] <cth> oh
[01:44:52] <cth> many thanks :)
[01:44:56] <cth> very cool
[01:45:12] <GreenJello> it's best to not tack extra properties onto the array, though
[01:45:19] <cth> so it's normal to have a mixed structure like this? Wouldn't JSON.stringify go crazy from it?
[01:45:30] <jaawerth> and unlike in plain objects, the integer keys are actual integers
[01:45:39] <GreenJello> JSON.stringify will ignore the non-integer properties
[01:45:52] <GreenJello> jaawerth, nah, they're still strings
[01:46:06] <GreenJello> and the property ordering is the same as regular objects
[01:46:20] <jaawerth> oh yeah I guess the methods just coerce
[01:46:30] <jaawerth> since
[01:46:38] <jaawerth> n> Object.keys([1,2,3])
[01:46:39] <jellobot> (okay) [ '0', '1', '2' ]
[01:46:50] <GreenJello> most of the methods operate on a range(0, array.length) instead of listing keys
[01:47:15] <cth> well if stringify ignores them than it would result in the resulting obj to be different from inout if we stringify and then parse it?
[01:47:17] <GreenJello> ... and then do hasOwnProperty checks
[01:47:25] <jaawerth> it has to be more complicated than that for them to efficiently account for the possibility of sparse arrays the way they do
[01:47:30] <GreenJello> cth, yes
[01:47:33] <cth> oh no
[01:47:37] <GreenJello> that's another reason to avoid this
[01:47:42] <cth> yes, ok
[01:48:26] <jaawerth> yeah you'd generally only stick extra properties on an array if you don't care whether said properties are serialized

[05:48:35] <johtso> GreenJello: my use case is I have a cinema seats which I'm referring to using [number, number] (row, column). each seat then has a corresponding state. coming from Python land I thought I'd just be able to have a hashmap keyed by tuples.
[05:49:20] <GreenJello> there's a proposal for tuples, but it's not in the language yet
[05:49:46] <theskillwithin> https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple
[05:50:13] <theskillwithin> idk python,  but in js would it be just an array of arrays,  a 2d array basically
[05:50:15] <johtso> Do I really have to covert my keys to a string whenever I want to look the state up? or is there a nicer way?
[05:51:25] <systemfault> What type are your keys?
[05:51:38] <johtso> systemfault: [number, number]
[05:51:40] <wroathe> That's a really unfortunate choice of name that doesn't align with how most languages define tuples
[05:52:25] <systemfault> johtso: Yeah, you're stuck with strings.. myTuple.join('-') :(
[05:53:21] <johtso> systemfault, theskillwithin: might just be able to go with some kind of 2d array data structure instead and avoid this
[05:53:24] <wroathe> A tuple is usually generically defined as a type of value that contains a fixed number of elements where each value can have a distinct type
[05:53:39] <johtso> the tuple/record proposal sounds like a mighty good idea
[05:54:06] <theskillwithin> maybe like [{ row: 'a', seats: [] }, { row: 'b', seats: [] }]
[05:54:45] <johtso> theskillwithin: yeah, I think that'll be the way
[05:56:42] <theskillwithin> raffle app I never finished, cuz covid cancelled the conference https://d4dnjdsd285hx.cloudfront.net/
[05:57:27] <wroathe> I'd probably call them something like ConstArray and ConstObject
[05:58:24] <wroathe> Or ClosedArray and ClosedObject
[05:59:17] <GreenJello> wroathe, the tuples proposal is very similar to python tuples
[05:59:46] <theskillwithin> I can't wait till we get tuples and records
[06:00:24] <theskillwithin> also temporal, i think the polyfill is still being worked on
[06:00:54] <wroathe> GreenJello: I suppose you're right. There's still something about this that doesn't sit right with me for some reason. Still mulling it over.

[09:09:09] <matsaman> ThePendulum: if the title can be trusted: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/es6-generators-in-javascript-9cc301ed7665
[09:09:24] <ljharb> nah, generators are mostly useless
[09:09:45] <ljharb> it's convenient syntax to create a lazy iterator, but it's rare that this makes a difference
[09:09:58] <ljharb> and when iterator helpers land, there'll be even less reason to use it
[09:10:03] <incognito> or let i=0; :-)
[09:10:06] <matsaman> convenience doesn't makea  difference?
[09:10:25] <ljharb> matsaman: it does, but only if you need a lazy iterator that's not based on an existing iterable. which virtually nobody does.
[09:11:15] <matsaman> you'd rather the language and interpreter be simpler and not bother with it
[09:11:33] <ljharb> yep

[11:48:04] <CoderGuy> hmm, so what's the closest way I can achieve this then?
[11:48:07] <ljharb> yes, class fields use [[Define]]

[11:49:45] <CoderGuy> look any answer that allows the get/set to work hopefully one where it appears more class structured is a great answer for me

[11:50:15] <ljharb> CoderGuy: you don't

[11:51:06] <ashnur> before giving any advice, i would like to know wtf you are trying to do CoderGuy
[11:51:07] <CoderGuy> well 2 reasons
[11:51:19] <theskillwithin> !xy
[11:51:19] <jellobot> theskillwithin, The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X. See also: http://xyproblem.info/
[11:51:25] <CoderGuy> ashnur I want to have get set on a variable, but also I need to have a key property for said variable
[11:51:41] <ashnur> right, but why
[11:51:55] <ashnur> i mean, why you are coding this, what is the end goal?
[11:51:59] <CoderGuy> so that when I run Object.keys(theobject);  it has said key property
[11:52:07] <ljharb> CoderGuy: then definitely don't use a getter/setter
[11:52:10] <ljharb> CoderGuy: just use a normal data property
[11:52:17] <ashnur> because you are so deep, at that level, you could be doing a phd for all i know
[11:52:28] <CoderGuy> well i'm using an implement-js plugin which works sorta like an interface in that it assures the class has the proper interfaced material
[11:52:41] <CoderGuy> and the way it works, is it checks the class for a key property
[11:52:44] <ljharb> that seems like a pretty bad thing to use
[11:52:47] <CoderGuy> get set has a problem with this
[11:53:00] <ljharb> plugins in general, but also one that leans too heavily on "interfaces", something JS doesn't have, or classes, something best avoided
[11:53:02] <ashnur> no, let me put it differently CoderGuy, if you don't achieve what you are asking us about now, what is the worst that can happen to you?
[11:53:20] <CoderGuy> um, I mean i'd be upset I guess, but I just want to achieve this lol
[11:53:27] <ljharb> why tho
[11:53:35] <ljharb> no problem requires `class`
[11:53:38] <theskillwithin> sounds like homework problem
[11:53:38] <CoderGuy> like i'm willing to just use Object.defineProperty at this point but i'm curious if it's achievable
[11:53:46] <ashnur> yeah, i am glad i asked because for me this is perversion, abstract art
[11:53:49] <CoderGuy> no it's my library I just want to build it properly
[11:53:56] <ashnur> so fine, go ahead and do it, but it's not practical in any sense
[11:54:04] <CoderGuy> I don't understand
[11:54:08] <CoderGuy> get and set exist yes? what is the problem?
[11:54:11] <ljharb> CoderGuy: "properly" would be "not with a class"
[11:54:19] <ljharb> CoderGuy: also why would there be plugins involved, plugins are bad
[11:54:29] <CoderGuy> well cuz javascript has no interface tools
[11:54:30] <ljharb> CoderGuy: lots of bad things exist. "it exists" is never a justification to use something.
[11:54:36] <ljharb> CoderGuy: right. so INTERFACES IN JS ARE BAD
[11:54:43] <ljharb> CoderGuy: it's not a concept that's good for JS
[11:54:54] <CoderGuy> what does that mean?
[11:55:05] <ljharb> it means it's not a thing so stop trying to make it one
[11:55:25] <CoderGuy> I want my class objects to have certain variables and functions, an interface assures they do
[11:55:28] <CoderGuy> what's wrong with this?
[11:55:34] <ljharb> a number of things
[11:55:38] <ljharb> inheritance is bad
[11:55:38] <ashnur> it's an outdated ideology CoderGuy
[11:55:45] <ashnur> that's all that's bad with it
[11:55:49] <ljharb> but also, why do you need to adhere to some interfce
[11:55:56] <theskillwithin> ljharb welp doesn't react use it
[11:55:57] <CoderGuy> an outdated ideology that was invented in the past 20 years?
[11:56:00] <ljharb> theskillwithin: not really
[11:56:04] <ljharb> theskillwithin: especially not with SFCs
[11:56:08] <ashnur> ljharb, well, there is an I in API :D
[11:56:10] <ljharb> CoderGuy: it was invented 40 years ago
[11:56:16] <CoderGuy> so...
[11:56:23] <CoderGuy> that's pretty recent

[11:56:42] <CoderGuy> you said outdated
[11:56:57] <ashnur> CoderGuy, yes, imagine that, because in that two decades there were **several** orders of magnitudes of complexity added to the systems we are building
[11:56:57] <ljharb> CoderGuy: yes, it's outdated in that we all realize it's not good now
[11:56:59] <CoderGuy> if it was invented tomorrow would you still say outdated?
[11:57:07] <ljharb> CoderGuy: it's not about when it was invented, it's about when it was popular
[11:57:14] <ljharb> CoderGuy: it's unpopular now because we all figured out it sucks
[11:57:23] <CoderGuy> what sucks about making sure class objects have functions?
[11:57:31] <ljharb> !nouns @ CoderGuy
[11:57:31] <jellobot> CoderGuy, In JavaScript, verbs are equally important as nouns. http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html
[11:57:42] <ljharb> CoderGuy: you don't need objects to carry functions around. they stand alone.
[11:57:48] <ashnur> CoderGuy, only if the context has changed since
[11:57:50] <CoderGuy> what does that even mean?
[11:57:54] <ljharb> CoderGuy: read the article
[11:58:00] <CoderGuy> i'm not reading an article
[11:58:05] <ljharb> lol
[11:58:15] <ljharb> then i guess you can keep doing subpar things
[11:58:19] <CoderGuy> I gave a very specific question to which you're attacking the entire foundation of coding it's so weird
[11:58:24] <ashnur> yeah, that article is 15 years old, must be outdated, lol
[11:58:30] <ljharb> it's not the foundation of coding
[11:58:33] <ljharb> it's the dogma of bad coders
[11:58:36] <CoderGuy> dude

[11:58:49] <ljharb> another article you should read, but i guess won't
[11:58:51] <ashnur> or, it was 15 years ago that the zeitgeist has passed over some ideas :D
[11:58:55] *** Joins: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-6df0ec-147.dhcp.inet.fi)
[11:59:13] <ljharb> CoderGuy: the reality is that you can't use class fields if you want to interoperate with superclass getters/setters
[11:59:31] <ljharb> CoderGuy: you wouldn't use defineProperty either. you'd just use assignment in the constructor
[11:59:50] <ljharb> CoderGuy: but Object.keys only returns own properties, so you'd have to do a bunch of bad things to install own getters.
[12:00:01] <ljharb> CoderGuy: iow, what you want is wrong, and you should simply *stop wanting that*
[12:00:03] <ashnur> CoderGuy, to your question "what sucks about class objects have functions" is that you are coupling, complecting two things that are better kept separated
[12:00:17] <CoderGuy> what?
[12:00:31] <theskillwithin> ljharb in the past tho when I said should be using hooks instead of class components you seemed resistant?
[12:00:37] <ashnur> the idea of identity with a set of mappings to values
[12:00:46] <ljharb> theskillwithin: sure. class components are better, more often than people realize
[12:00:51] <ljharb> theskillwithin: not always ofc
[12:00:59] <ashnur> so a class entity object that has methods that have exclusive control over data,
[12:01:01] <ljharb> theskillwithin: but that's not really relevant to this conversation
[12:01:12] <ashnur> aka. encapsulation
[12:01:17] <ljharb> theskillwithin: and hooks are super weird
[12:01:26] <CoderGuy> what's wrong with a class having it's own control over data?
[12:01:34] <ljharb> CoderGuy: nothing
[12:01:50] <ljharb> CoderGuy: but Object.keys() is about own properties. that is fundamentally incompatible with the OO mental model of classes.
[12:02:09] <ljharb> CoderGuy: iow, if you want to use Object.keys, you shouldn't be using classes. they're kind of mutually exclusive.
[12:02:22] <CoderGuy> sigh
[12:02:22] <ashnur> hooks are much more natural to react, class components are faster but only because we are not using future react yet. and fucking react in 2017 was faster than react18 that's coming now
[12:02:33] <ljharb> faster is irrelevant
[12:02:37] <ljharb> and i don't agree hooks are more natural
[12:02:37] <ashnur> so performance considerations are moot
[12:02:42] <ashnur> yeah, so hooks are better :D
[12:02:50] <seed0> yeah react hooks def dont feel natural...
[12:02:54] <ashnur> because class components are only better in performance
[12:02:58] *** Joins: hendursa1 (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[12:02:58] <ljharb> sometimes things are cleaner with hooks. but nothing about hooks is natural or normal or idiomatic.
[12:03:04] <CoderGuy> okay this was a fun journey down the philosophical ideas of coding, but can someone anyone
[12:03:09] <theskillwithin> esp with react 18 now
[12:03:18] <ashnur> interesting you would say that ljharb, for me they feel quite the opposite
[12:03:22] <ljharb> CoderGuy: that stuff's way more important than the actual answer to your question, which i already gave you
[12:03:32] <ljharb> hooks are a really shitty and overly clever desperation move to try to get rid of class components.
[12:03:35] <CoderGuy> is there a way to define a property and also use get/set other then Object.defineProperty one that preferably maintains the get set model of a variable
[12:03:42] <ljharb> CoderGuy: not really no
[12:03:48] <CoderGuy> okay fair enough
[12:03:54] <ashnur> ljharb, no, hooks are a half-baked implementation of namespacing
[12:04:04] <CoderGuy> if there is a way that'd be cool but if not, what is happening where Object.defineProperty makes this work?
[12:04:07] <ljharb> CoderGuy: you can use defineProperty in the constructor to laboriously set a bunch of own enumerable getters and setters. but it's a waste of effort.
[12:04:15] <ljharb> ashnur: it has nothing to do with namespacing
[12:04:17] <theskillwithin> both of you ignoring most recent version of react
[12:04:23] <ashnur> ljharb, it has everything to do with namespacing
[12:04:35] <ljharb> theskillwithin: react 18 doesn't exist yet
[12:04:36] <ashnur> that's how they know how to track state.
[12:04:41] <ljharb> theskillwithin: prereleases don't count
[12:04:49] <ljharb> ashnur: it's not component state tho.
[12:04:54] <CoderGuy> wait but ljharb why does defineProperty work here?
[12:05:00] <CoderGuy> what is so special?
[12:05:01] <ljharb> ashnur: it's state on the element in the react tree, which is something you never see directly.
[12:05:07] <ashnur> it's ALL state. every hook is just a use-ref hook
[12:05:11] <ljharb> CoderGuy: it's not special, it's basic JS semantics
[12:05:23] <CoderGuy> okay so what is happening?
[12:05:34] <CoderGuy> why does the classic version fail but the defineProperty in constructor work?
[12:05:36] <theskillwithin> they technicaly show improved performance not decreased from classes
[12:05:56] <theskillwithin> esp cuz of the minor improvments from not needing to import react
[12:06:19] <ljharb> CoderGuy: class fields define own data properties
[12:06:26] <ljharb> CoderGuy: so, they always shadow inherited getters/setters
[12:06:47] <CoderGuy> i'm very confused although i'm sure that's a great answer
[12:06:49] <ljharb> ashnur: it's a side channel. that's not the same thing.
[12:06:50] <CoderGuy> what does that mean?
[12:06:57] <ljharb> CoderGuy: it means precisely what i said.
[12:06:59] <ashnur> ljharb, can i have a guess? you don't like hooks because your conventional tools can't do anything with them, e.g. the testing library that pretends to test react, but actually tests your components in isolation without testing react
[12:07:09] <ljharb> CoderGuy: if you don't know what that means you need to read !eloquent and learn JS basics firs.t
[12:07:20] <ljharb> ashnur: no idea what you mean there
[12:07:26] <ljharb> ashnur: and it has nothing to do with testing
[12:07:27] <ashnur> ok, so i am wrong
[12:07:30] <ashnur> sry
[12:07:38] <ljharb> ashnur: i don't like hooks because the only way they work is by throwing exceptions
[12:07:40] <CoderGuy> how is having get ok(){} and set ok(){} an inherited thing?
[12:07:49] <theskillwithin> its almost insane to me someone things class components are better than hooks in react nowdays
[12:07:51] <ljharb> CoderGuy: both of those are defined on the prototype
[12:07:55] <ljharb> CoderGuy: that's how `class` works.
[12:07:59] <CoderGuy> but ok; is not?
[12:08:01] <ashnur> ljharb, i thought that's all javascript now :D
[12:08:03] <ljharb> CoderGuy: so instances of the class inherit from the prototype
[12:08:05] <ljharb> CoderGuy: correct
[12:08:07] <CoderGuy> wait is it still in the prototype?
[12:08:13] <ljharb> CoderGuy: `ok;` is a class field, which is an own property on the instance
[12:08:23] <ljharb> CoderGuy: YES. getters and setters are always on the prototype, never on the instance.
[12:08:23] <CoderGuy> how can I list out what the prototype has?
[12:08:40] <ljharb> CoderGuy: `console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(instance))`

[12:10:16] <ljharb> CoderGuy: again, using `Object.keys()` with a class instance is a fundamental incompatibility
[12:10:17] <ashnur> ljharb, the throwing exception thing was part of class components afaik, that's how they could stop long running renders and then later resume it
[12:10:24] <ljharb> ashnur: that's Suspense
[12:10:29] <ljharb> ashnur: but all hooks work by throwing
[12:10:42] <CoderGuy> doesn't show the getters/setters hmm
[12:10:42] <ashnur> no, I am talking about all renders
[12:10:43] <ljharb> ashnur: otherwise they couldn't pause your non-generator non-async component function
[12:10:45] <CoderGuy> wait
[12:10:49] <CoderGuy> maybe cuz object define is still there one sec
[12:10:55] <ljharb> CoderGuy: right. because getters/setters are NEVER on the instance, only on the prototype
[12:11:01] <ljharb> CoderGuy: because that's how `class` works, in every language
[12:11:07] <ashnur> but they don't pause it?
[12:11:09] <CoderGuy> wait
[12:11:14] <ljharb> ashnur: they do
[12:11:16] <ashnur> ljharb, can you show me the code or issue
[12:11:26] <CoderGuy> no but I can't see the getter/setter on the prototype
[12:11:42] <ljharb> ashnur: oh i guess it depends on the hook, some just spit out default values and rerender
[12:11:50] <ljharb> CoderGuy: probably because they're non-enumerable
[12:12:00] <ljharb> CoderGuy: because you're not supposed to be programmatically discovering them
[12:12:02] <ashnur> ljharb, I don't understand, which hook pauses
[12:12:05] <theskillwithin> ashnur maybe we should hold off for a bit.  let CoderGuy get attention
[12:12:15] <CoderGuy> hmmm
[12:12:21] <ljharb> ashnur: i thought they all did. maybe only suspense does tho.
[12:12:30] <ashnur> theskillwithin, the abstract artist got lots of attention already :) I am curious about this react thing.
[12:12:42] <CoderGuy> so there's no way to be like "hey prototype give me that getter/setter so I can have it on my instance" ?
[12:12:55] <seed0> ?
[12:13:12] <ljharb> CoderGuy: no
[12:13:17] <CoderGuy> dang
[12:13:21] <CoderGuy> well that's terrible
[12:13:22] <ljharb> CoderGuy: you're not supposed to do that, it's antithetical to how classes work

[12:13:31] <theskillwithin> ashnur so am i, and i think i agree with you.  but we can ask anytime
[12:13:47] <CoderGuy> what's the point of making it so that a get/set is fine unless you define it at the top?

[12:14:18] <CoderGuy> also how come one cant' do ok = {get set here}
[12:14:28] <ashnur> CoderGuy, you should look into clojure and clojurescript

[12:16:17] <theskillwithin> np mistake
[12:16:18] <CoderGuy> anyways while it's here lol
[12:16:22] <ljharb> just have a public data property
[12:16:28] <ljharb> getters and setters give you no value there
[12:16:28] <ashnur> no lol
[12:16:46] <CoderGuy> how can you achieve that but in javascript, for some reason the only way get set works is without defining the variable first which is weird to me
[12:17:14] <ashnur> :D
[12:17:21] <CoderGuy> or can you not? is that not a thing?
[12:17:31] <ljharb> CoderGuy: "doing that" is not a thing
[12:17:32] <ashnur> you lost me
[12:17:40] <CoderGuy> ok
[12:17:45] <ljharb> CoderGuy: just make a `Name` property. no getter/setter needed
[12:17:49] <CoderGuy> so the define property is the way around it
[12:17:53] <ljharb> CoderGuy: srsly, forget about C# entirely
[12:17:57] <CoderGuy> hahahah
[12:17:59] <ljharb> CoderGuy: no, "using a normal property" is the way around it
[12:18:01] <ljharb> no get/set VER.
[12:18:03] <ljharb> *EVER
[12:18:18] <ljharb> the way C# does things might be fine there, but it's actively harmful in JS
[12:18:22] <CoderGuy> ljharb but I want a function to run whenever a variable is changed
[12:18:36] <ashnur> if i want some object with a name, I do `{:name "Bob"}` or in js `{name: "Bob"}`
[12:18:36] <ljharb> CoderGuy: and i'm saying you're wrong to want that
[12:18:47] <ljharb> CoderGuy: if you want a function to run, make the caller *invoke a function*. using `()`
[12:18:58] <ashnur> that's all what is required for having a get and set on an object with a name property
[12:18:58] <ljharb> CoderGuy: *variables* changing can never be observed

[12:22:28] <seed0> lol
[12:22:30] <ljharb> your thinking doesn't change that get/set is really bad
[12:22:41] <CoderGuy> you have yet to explain why it's bad
[12:22:49] <ljharb> it's slow, and it's confusing and harder to maintain
[12:22:53] <ashnur> CoderGuy, have you heard about "place oriented programming"?
[12:22:58] <ljharb> and literally the only benefit is that the callsite doesn't have to use `()`
[12:22:58] <ashnur> aka. PLOP
[12:22:59] <CoderGuy> nope what's that
[12:23:13] <ljharb> iow, `foo.g` vs `foo.g()`
[12:23:14] <ashnur> CoderGuy, that's getters and setters. You have a place, and you can get or set what's in it.
[12:23:18] <CoderGuy> hmmm ljharb I think I understand what you're saying
[12:23:21] <ljharb> or `foo.g = h` vs `foo.g(h)`
[12:23:25] <Maxdamantus> The main difference between variables and properties WRT getters/setters is that variables are lexically scoped, so they're not shared outside of where they're declared. There's no reason to make it a getter/setter since you can always just replace all uses of the variable.
[12:23:29] <ashnur> so your precious cool thing is what we call plopping
[12:23:32] <ljharb> if you want to evaluate code then *call a function*
[12:23:34] <CoderGuy> like if you're gonna change variables, that require more things, then just use a function that is a bit logical
[12:23:35] <ashnur> place oriented programming
[12:23:38] <ljharb> CoderGuy: yes.
[12:23:45] <CoderGuy> I can grasp that idea
[12:23:51] <ljharb> CoderGuy: make things look like what they are
[12:23:52] <ashnur> you focus on the place where the value is, not on the actual value
[12:24:01] <ljharb> CoderGuy: if something is calling a function, and it doesn't look like it's calling a function, it is HARMFUL.

[12:27:49] <ljharb> CoderGuy: display is where react comes in
[12:27:56] <ashnur> CoderGuy, just write a text into the document in the browser. or whatever gui you are using
[12:28:02] <ljharb> CoderGuy: your data should be completely decoupled from the UI
[12:28:06] <ashnur> react is for complex stuff
[12:28:14] <CoderGuy> sure lets say you have a chat feed, and in the chat feed there is a submitted text object, but you want to update said chat text to be a link
[12:28:32] <ashnur> if you just want one, single value presented, you should just put that value in the display.
[12:28:45] <ashnur> a chat is complex, you do need something like react
[12:28:46] <CoderGuy> chatobject.text = "hello world www.welcometothejungle"
[12:28:57] <ashnur> many async things need to happen correctly for a good chat experience
[12:29:08] <CoderGuy> versus chatobject.setText("hello world www.welcometothejungle");
[12:29:12] <ljharb> react is for anything
[12:29:24] <ljharb> CoderGuy: you would 100% use the latter
[12:29:31] <CoderGuy> so setText() instead?
[12:29:32] <ljharb> CoderGuy: mutation should be avoided
[12:29:33] <ljharb> CoderGuy: yes
[12:29:38] <CoderGuy> hmmm okay okay
[12:29:40] <ashnur> yeah, neither of those CoderGuy, it's more like queue("text")
[12:29:44] <CoderGuy> I think I can understand what you mean by this
[12:29:56] <CoderGuy> in that case
[12:29:56] <theskillwithin> ashnur what meany people might not think about is chat scrolls up from the bottom, so gotta figure that out
[12:29:59] <CoderGuy> can I make variables private?
[12:30:13] <ljharb> CoderGuy: all variables are private
[12:30:20] <ljharb> there exists no other form of privacy than lexical scope
[12:30:24] <ljharb> and that form is absolute
[12:30:36] <ljharb> CoderGuy: but *properties* are not variables, and these are all public
[12:30:40] <CoderGuy> oh
[12:30:43] <CoderGuy> can I make a property private?
[12:30:44] <ljharb> you can use private fields on class instances tho.
[12:30:50] <ljharb> there are no private properties tho.
[12:31:17] <CoderGuy> javascript is so open to anything happening ever lol
[12:31:36] <CoderGuy> but ljharb you've convinced me
[12:31:38] <ashnur> and really, instead of chatobject.text("msg"), text(chatobject, "msg")
[12:31:40] <CoderGuy> I will just not use get/set I guess
[12:31:44] <theskillwithin> well with modules, everything in that module is private in a sense
[12:31:48] <ashnur> and you can .bind it :D
[12:32:08] <CoderGuy> ashnur, what does .bind mean?

[12:39:00] <CoderGuy> what if you have a function with the same name as your variable?

[15:34:56] <hassoon> zacts: sure, it's a global variable, but you're filling the textFileContent variable from onside the fetch's .then() block, that's an asynchronous approach, you won't get the value of the text from outside the fetch then block

[15:38:48] <MJCD> !tutorial
[15:38:48] <jellobot> MJCD, It is HIGHLY recommended that you establish a firm grasp of the core syntax within both JavaScript, HTML, and basic CSS. Before asking any syntax error related questions you can use `!eslint` to detect any contextual errors. A critically acclaimed tutorial is available @ http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[15:39:10] <hassoon> zacts: because the fetch api uses an asynchronous approach to get data, while whatever lies outside your fetch api is a synchronous code
[15:39:34] <hassoon> zacts: see synchronous vs asynchronous in google

[15:41:01] <jellobot> entuland, Promises are placeholders for values that'll be provided in the future. They allow composing asynchronous operations like synchronous ones.

[17:32:18] <systemfault> fweht: What's that language?
[17:32:32] <systemfault> Looks like some haskell bastardisation
[17:32:36] <stennowork> Takes a list of predicates and returns a predicate that returns true for a given list of arguments if every one of the provided predicates is satisfied by those arguments.
[17:32:36] <stennowork> The function returned is a curried function whose arity matches that of the highest-arity predicate.
[17:32:55] <fweht> systemfault: which language?  rambda is a javascript library, but i havent figured out the exact syntax they use for (informal) type annotations
[17:33:03] <fweht> the type annotations are in their documentation only
[17:33:12] <systemfault> Ah, I see

[17:37:15] <systemfault> JS doesn't have types... so they use that bastardisation of haskell types.
[17:37:28] <fweht> systemfault: yes, but i thought the asterisk already covers the 'many arguments'
[17:38:19] <fweht> as `always` has the type `a â†’ (* â†’ a)` and works with e.g. `R.always(4)()`or `R.always(4)(1,2,3)`
[17:38:25] <systemfault> Have you ever worked with a typed language at all?

[19:27:44] <qswz> just use npm
[19:27:48] <domino14> this works though: node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js --ext js,ts,tsx src
[19:27:50] <domino14> no
[19:27:54] <qswz> why not
[19:28:03] <qswz> yarn is more kewl?

[19:28:10] <qswz> lolo
[19:28:22] <qswz> npm just works these days

[19:29:47] <qswz> or normally eslint . --qiet as a npm script works too, it does for me at least
[19:30:00] <domino14> oh, because npm is actually doing something behind the scenes

[19:30:10] <domino14> maybe i should use npm, but i just spent several hours updating to yarn v2 lol

[21:44:58] <Slade> so. my main thing is having a table  (Pie Eaters)..  with columns (Name, favourite pie, pie kill count, etc)..   and have the entire row if you click on it go to (/person) but also make it if you clic on the favourite pie it'll go to (/pie...)  or whatever

[21:45:18] <qswz> I know that issue
[21:45:36] <qswz> you've 2 solutions
[21:45:40] <Slade> however, its a really common way to do this i think
[21:45:52] <MJCD> Slade: err why would it be
[21:46:08] <MJCD> just make sure it's not just the pie name text that links to the pie sub
[21:46:17] <MJCD> it should be the entire "cell"
[21:46:21] <MJCD> (container element)
[21:46:27] <qswz> either use <div role="table">...<a role="row"><span role="cell" and
[21:46:29] <qswz> cCSS
[21:46:36] <MJCD> and maybe a visual annotation that it's linking to a sub-title not to another page
[21:46:45] <MJCD> or vice versa (ie an indicator for external links)
[21:46:57] <qswz> or use basic tables and each <td> contains an anchor (strechted to the whole cell)
[21:47:04] <MJCD> lol qsw
[21:47:09] <qswz> make a function helper to generate the markup/jsx

[22:10:01] <MJCD> what's triggering the break
[22:10:25] <MJCD> I mean I guess the answer generally speaking would be to break on the very first line of your code

[22:10:34] <MJCD> etc
[22:10:42] <MJCD> but that's not before /any/ js might run

[23:27:36] <CuriousErnestBro> hello, what's a good timezone library? I want to track past dates+times from different timezones and get the exact whole days until now

[23:30:32] <CuriousErnestBro> thanks
