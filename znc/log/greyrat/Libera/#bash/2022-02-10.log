[04:53:46] <Lebela> can I perform some kind of trick, to always make "ffmpeg" be called with "time" in front of it?
[04:54:07] <Lebela> I was thinking about placing a file named "ffmpeg" into /usr/local/bin  with the content:
[04:54:14] <Lebela> time ffmpeg $i
[04:54:18] <Lebela> time ffmpeg $1

[06:00:48] <Lebela> Example:

[06:01:11] <Lebela> but instead of manually doing that,  ffmpeg should do it

[06:10:02] <pj> !pe > Lebela
[06:10:03] <greybot> Lebela: Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}".

[10:09:29] <Lebela> the ffmpeg command I am planning on running requires me to pass in the amount of files
[10:09:39] <Lebela> so I need to find out the amount of elements in the array
[10:09:50] <Lebela> my question is,  if there is a better solution to my divided by 2 hack
[10:09:54] <Lebela> # touch 00{1..5}.mp4; opts=(); for f in *; do opts+=(-i "$f"); done; echo ffmpeg "${opts[@]}" ; echo $((${#opts[@]} / 2))
[10:09:55] <shbot> Lebela: ffmpeg -i 001.mp4 -i 002.mp4 -i 003.mp4 -i 004.mp4 -i 005.mp4
[10:09:55] <shbot> Lebela: 5
[10:10:43] <Lebela> because the -i params are also elements
[10:10:48] <Lebela> so that's why I divided by 2
[10:11:25] <Lebela> oh, I forgot the quoting again here by $((${#opts[@]}

[10:31:33] <Lebela> please kindly look at the part saying:  n=3
[10:31:43] <Lebela> 3 refers to the amount of videos to be concatenated
[10:31:50] <looah> sure
[10:32:12] <Lebela> looah, yeah, but how do I will this number?
[10:32:21] <looah> you already mentioned how
[10:32:25] <Lebela> divided by 2 as I showed above looks stupid somehow
[10:32:33] <Lebela> ok, then I will do as I said
[10:32:34] <Lebela> thank you
[10:32:46] <looah> since you went the route of making sure -i isn't touching its argument you now have an array that is twice the number of elements
[10:33:08] <Lebela> looah, that was actually thanks to the help of phy1729 before
[10:33:16] <Lebela> looah, he helped me with that line, thankfully
[10:33:22] <Lebela> I just added the divided thingy
[10:34:42] <geirha> you can count while generating the array
[10:35:06] <geirha> opts+=(-i "$f") ; (( n++ ))

[10:36:03] <Lebela> geirha, oh, that makes sense!
[10:36:06] <Lebela> geirha, thank you
[10:36:15] <Lebela> do I need to declare the variable n outside the array first?
[10:36:22] <geirha> opts+=(-i "$f") filter+="[$((n++)):v:0]"
[10:36:23] <Lebela> so that it's a gloally known variable?
[10:36:53] <geirha> it'll initialize to 0 or empty string first time you use it
[10:37:05] <Lebela> thank you geirha !
[10:37:55] <Lebela> geirha, out of curiosity, even though I will use n++ as suggested by you
[10:38:07] <Lebela> if I were to use the divided by 2 way... where do I need to quote?
[10:38:09] <Lebela> echo ffmpeg "${opts[@]}" foo bar $((${#opts[@]} / 2))
[10:38:22] <Lebela> $(("${#opts[@]}" / 2))
[10:38:24] <Lebela> ^ like this?
[10:38:28] <Lebela> or outside?
[10:38:31] *** Joins: hB7drf (~quassel@user/hB7drf)
[10:38:35] <Lebela> "$((${#opts[@]} / 2))"
[10:38:56] <geirha> no need for quoting inside $(( )). You use quotes to prevent word-splitting and pathname expansion, and those steps don't happen inside $(( ))
[10:39:16] <geirha> so yes, the latter   ffmpeg "${opts[@]}" foo bar "$((${#opts[@]} / 2))"

[13:02:44] <cxl> Hi all, I'm trying to capture the outpout of a (very verbose) command to a text file, but none of the usual methods work. I tried DEBUG=100 mycommand ... 2>&1 > myfile.txt, > myfile.txt, | nc termbin.com 9999, | tee myfile.txt... None of these work, the output is still going to my terminal and the text file is empty. Is there another output than stdout and stderr that I can't capture? Any ideas?

[13:07:27] <dirtwash> stupid question, i stored the output of some openssl line in a variable, if i try to print the variable i get lot of 'no such file or directtory' for each line in the output
[13:07:41] <dirtwash> is there anotehr trick to just print this to terminal?
[13:08:07] <lopid> printf %s\\n "$var"
[13:08:14] <lopid> or declare -p var
[13:09:18] <dirtwash> thanks

[13:09:55] <Soliton> sounds like you're rather trying to execute the variable or something.
[13:09:57] <dirtwash> and if i try to pipe this variable into openssl again I get a invalid x509 error, if i run this in terminal as one line with pipe it works, i assume the variable scrables the output to pipe somehow?
[13:10:47] <dirtwash> Soliton: hm no in the first case it was just something like cert=$(openssl....) and i tried printing it
[13:11:21] <Soliton> you keep telling anecdotes about what you do. who knows. perhaps you're doing something wrong.

[18:07:51] <emanuele6> so either  ~/.bashrc  doesn't exist or the last command executed in ~/.bashrc doesn't return 0.
[18:08:00] <emanuele6> but why would you ever use   source ~/.bashrc && ./my_script.sh
[18:08:08] <emanuele6> also put a shebang in your script.
[18:08:36] <ezzieyguywuf> emanuele6: well, I'm working on defining a new function in .bashrc, and I wanted to re-source bashrc and run the function on a one-liner
[18:08:40] <emanuele6> so what?
[18:08:42] <emanuele6> use ;
[18:09:20] <emanuele6> you are explicitly using && and complaining about it not working ;
[18:09:26] <emanuele6> s/;/as ;/
[18:09:27] <ezzieyguywuf> ah, good point
[18:09:44] <emanuele6> !shebang
[18:09:44] <ezzieyguywuf> I tend to forget about ;, I guess I got in the habit of using && a while ago
[18:09:44] <greybot> A script MUST begin with a #! line, called the "shebang" (from hash+bang). It tells the kernel what interpreter to run, to read your script. See <http://stackoverflow.com/a/733901/58803> and <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments#Scripts> and <http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/>
[18:09:46] <ezzieyguywuf> thanks for the help!
[18:10:26] <emanuele6> if you don't put a shebang in your script, it can only be run from bash because bash assumes that text files without a shebang are bash scripts
[18:10:39] <emanuele6> outside of bash, the kernel does not make that assumption
[18:11:04] <ezzieyguywuf> yea in the `my_script.sh` example I had a shebang line
