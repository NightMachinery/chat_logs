[07:37:49] <rawktucc> so i finally have real gigabit
[07:38:30] <rawktucc> the only problem is possibly twofold: 1. im double NATed, may be slowing things down slightly. 2. right now im rcloning youtube-dl stuff, which is small and inconsistent  so speeds are fluctuating
[07:38:40] <rawktucc> that said im immediately happier to just have something of actual speed
[07:38:57] <rawktucc> 3. remote server peering may be an issue
[07:42:21] <rawktucc> Just saw it hit 90-100MB/s. i actually thing my HDDs may be the bottleneck a bit here now too
[07:42:31] <rawktucc> mergerfs has noticeable slowdown in read/writes
[07:42:46] <rawktucc> i can hear the drives grinding now, i won't be able to sleep tonight :D
[07:43:35] <JTL> need more SSD backed storage :P
[07:43:47] <rawktucc> i priced out 8TB QLC drives... about $10000
[07:43:51] <rawktucc> 80TB that is
[07:44:06] <JTL> and QLC :/
[07:44:10] <rawktucc> and qlc...
[07:44:44] <rawktucc> my data really is mostly cold though... having fancy SSDs wont help much tbh, only if i was using zfs maybe on scrubs. snapraid is fast though until it hits individual drives
[07:44:50] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_ø<​ quac​k!

[08:24:07] <evilgohan2> rawktucc: Why are you behind double NAT? I ask because I have some experience with this so I'm curious
[08:24:13] <rawktucc> laziness
[08:24:19] <rawktucc> Also... laziness and uh
[08:24:20] <evilgohan2> ISP provided router + your own?
[08:24:23] <rawktucc> Yes
[08:24:29] <evilgohan2> Ah, DMZ your router and be done with it.
[08:24:50] <rawktucc> I kinda sorta don't want the ISP router seeing what I'm moving around on the LAN, device to device, and don't want it seeing internal NATted IP services I'm broadcasting 
[08:24:53] <evilgohan2> also, most routers use cut through switching so performance impacts are neglible. 
[08:25:14] <rawktucc> what's DMZ? would that give me a different external IP?
[08:25:25] <evilgohan2> No, it opens all ports on the IP specified.
[08:25:27] <rawktucc> i don't want the ISP router seeing my internal services
[08:25:29] <rawktucc> oh
[08:25:33] <rawktucc> I don't really need that
[08:26:06] <evilgohan2> It's helpful. Also, your ISP is probably not monitoring you at the router level. Why would they bother with that and bogging down its performance when they can just DPI you from the main hub? lol
[08:26:12] <evilgohan2> /s but not
[08:26:35] <evilgohan2> But there's a way around that if you want to pound your head into a wall
[08:26:50] <evilgohan2> I say that in jest mostly because the process of doing so is annoying
[08:26:52] <evilgohan2> but it does work
[08:27:10] <evilgohan2> https://www.dslreports.com/faq/16949
[08:27:23] <evilgohan2> reference: https://www.dslreports.com/r0/download/2007970~5f79c2519d4bc9b7400b868443bd7303/Dual%20Router%20Separated%20Computer%20%26%20TV%20Service%20Networks.jpg
[08:27:40] <rawktucc> yeah the bell home hub 4000
[08:27:52] <rawktucc> you can do something with PPPoE to go direct past it and get another external ipv4
[08:27:56] <rawktucc> but it has a performance hit apparently
[08:28:32] <rawktucc> i think my endpoint (hetzner server) is the bottleneck actually, or the network path in general. i'm hitting 85MB/s consistently, with minor fluctuations to 90-100
[08:28:53] <rawktucc> im moving youtube videos too, and this is over sftp, so it's often short tcp transmit "windows"
[08:29:10] <rawktucc> oh it hit my noclip folder, this might bump things up a bit
[08:29:37] <evilgohan2> many small files always take longer to transfer (unless using multiple asychronous transfers)
[08:29:45] <evilgohan2> those bursts are likely larger files
[08:29:52] <rawktucc> im running 12 parallel transfers
[08:29:56] <evilgohan2> :S
[08:29:57] <rawktucc> speed is dropping sad :(
[08:30:25] <rawktucc> i know I can get gigabit down with this router, even over double NAT, so gigabit up shouldn't be a problem.
[08:30:36] <rawktucc> if I DMZ though does that bypass the router's NAT assignement?
[08:30:42] <rawktucc> *ISP router/modem
[08:30:57] <rawktucc> hearing a lot of HDD churning :thinking emoji:
[08:31:12] <evilgohan2> i/o is always a possibility as well
[08:31:20] <evilgohan2> and no
[08:31:42] <evilgohan2> boiling this down hard.
[08:31:46] <evilgohan2> Let's say your ISP router has a LAN address of 192.168.1.1
[08:32:01] <evilgohan2> and your 2nd router has a WAN address of 192.168.1.100
[08:32:35] <evilgohan2> By default, any *incoming* traffic has no way to reach your machine short of existing states
[08:32:47] <evilgohan2> or rather, your 2nd router
[08:32:53] <evilgohan2> So generally you would forward the ports you need
[08:33:03] <rawktucc> yup as I've done
[08:33:35] <evilgohan2> DMZ is a "lazy" way past that. It effectively just says "192.168.1.100 is open to everything" and that's that.
[08:33:52] <evilgohan2> I say "lazy" because... well, back in the day, it was a lazy way to do it. For double NAT, it's perfectly valid.
[08:35:05] <rawktucc> but i dont need all my ports open
[08:35:19] <rawktucc> i really just want to avoid double NAT for IP assignment... that said you said it shouldn't matter speed wise
[08:35:35] <rawktucc> thus I think this is either: I/O, remote host, general network speed/capacity (but it is 12am EST)
[08:35:41] <rawktucc> the HDD is reallllly churning though
[08:36:44] <evilgohan2> " you said it shouldn't matter speed wise"
[08:36:48] <evilgohan2> I mean, ideally.

[19:32:59] <skye0> right now i'm just angry by how long pandemic denialism is going on
[19:33:23] <skye0> i don't mind lockdowns, i just HATE deniers' takes on the whole thing. at this point they're gonna make it so it'll be like the fucking plague
[19:33:25] <ThePendulum> think it's been a while over here, we did have a lawyer and a crime reporter killed but that was because of their involvement against drug gangs
[19:33:42] <skye0> although that lasted only two years
[19:34:23] <ThePendulum> yeah it's one thing to say I don't think the benefits of a lockdown outweigh the drawbacks, but the amount of bullshit arguments they pile on
[19:34:32] <skye0> of course everyone wants lockdown and the pandemic to end but the fact that these fuckers don't even think COVID-19 exists is really fucking everyone else over - their source is ultimately derived from fuckers like Alex Jones
[19:35:09] <ThePendulum> one of them promised the vaccine would kill us on january 5 or something, still waiting
[19:35:42] <skye0> three vaccines, no side effects - granted, i've been rather hooked on booze
[19:35:44] <ThePendulum> gdi now too during the football competitions in europe, every time a player gets ill "vaccines at work again folks"
[19:36:29] <skye0> american conpsiracy theorists should be celebrating at this point, if they're still furious about the left trying to take over the world, i'll show them a catastrophe
[19:36:40] <skye0> i'm on medication too now so idk if i should be drinking alcohol but idk if i can trust anyone at this point to not be pissed off about pandemic deniers. i just hope pandemic deniers suffer (not die because that'd be way too far and that'll only keep their denialism going).
[19:37:18] <skye0> i know that pharmaceutical companies are greedy little shits but the solution is to redistribute their vaccines FOR FREE, not stop taking them!
[19:37:49] <ThePendulum> they're also not going to kill off their clientele
[19:38:17] <skye0> i hope they suffer severe symptoms at least so then they'll know actual pain
[19:38:32] <skye0> pain that some of us have to endure in the form of tone-deaf healthcare systems
[19:38:42] <skye0> because of systematic biases
[19:38:55] <ThePendulum> not enough to cause permanent damage but just enough to take it seriously
[19:38:59] <skye0> those who deny vaccines and the pandemic are more often than not in positions of power
[19:39:14] <ThePendulum> of course they'll always turn out to be the lucky ones as w ell
[19:39:57] <skye0> oh, i'm lucky. probably because i'm happy to stay in i'm not so pissed off by lockdowns but those fuckers are really doing it in
[19:40:15] <skye0> i'm lucky because the only things wrong with me are the fact i'm fat and fucked in the head

[19:45:27] <ThePendulum> yeah you prick we don't wear them because they're more fun
[19:45:27] <skye0> and that hospitals deny them  beds because they're all full up
[19:45:37] <ThePendulum> they're just slightly less inconvenient than babies or death

[19:46:14] <ThePendulum> whenever I get in my car I always make sure to put me condom on
[19:46:21] <skye0> i could always be more careful generally but pandemic denialism is rooted in the same attitudes as anti-Semitism, not to mention it's only prolonging the pandemic
[19:46:47] <skye0> my job has been empty at times because people have had sick leave no thanks to COVID
[19:47:38] <ThePendulum> I mean I'm sure there are similar fallacies at play but I wouldn't go as far as saying pandemic denialists are probably anti semetists
[19:49:03] <skye0> it may be more complicated than that, yes, especially with the likes of india who may be resorting to "home remedies" since distrust of westernized science may drive them to that
[19:50:21] <skye0> should be glad i got whiskey though but it's fkn expensive
[19:50:56] <ThePendulum> limited access to education and the medication itself probably doesn't help either
[19:51:14] <skye0> yes
[19:51:23] <skye0> also apparently the fear of needles but i could manage it
[19:51:48] <ThePendulum> and yeah not sure about india but some groups definitely have reason to be wary about some doctor saying they should try this novel drug
[19:51:58] <ThePendulum> white new age dance teachers aren't generally one of them
[19:51:59] <skye0> just the potential to get allergies still scares me a little bit
[19:52:00] <skye0> i hope a polyvalent vaccine comes out soon, it's in development
[19:52:48] <skye0> i blame colonialism for why the east is generally wary of western drugs being forced upon them. i blame fantasies of bringing back the 19th century or earlier for why the west denies the very vaccines they've created

[21:41:36] <BinaryWave> Hi gentlepeoples. I have just procured an r510 (12x HDD ~NAS, ideally zfs) and an r710 (6x HDD ~ virt server). any one have any good hdd suggestions? I've never had good luck with SeaGate>
[21:42:19] <BinaryWave> 3.5in
[21:42:47] <BinaryWave> for homelab/nfs/small hybrid cloud
[21:59:59] *** Parts: ee2455 (~ee2455@user/ee2455) (Leaving)
[22:06:13] <rawktucc> well then your oiptions are WD, Toshiba or HGST

[22:26:05] <BinaryWave> i've had an hgst as a consumer ext drive but mostly gone with wd as preference in the past. would just all wd reds be good for the nas if it will be running some auxillary virt servers like nextcloud, and for the main virt server what, green for power or black?
[22:31:30] <rawktucc> some WD Reds are bad for NAS because they're SMR drives which have a limit on how much data you can write at full speed initially
[22:31:34] <rawktucc> i would honestly just buy seagates
[22:31:54] <rawktucc> if you're serious about a new server, get some seagates with spares, and have backups off-site or in cloud stuff
