[00:02:33] <timelessness[m]> Hi People.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/22fe5f81962b0098eb61dfeab18d26d75be9296c)
[00:05:48] <Yamakaja[m]> timelessness: Hey, welcome :) GNU Radio can be used in a variety of ways, there are lots of things you can do without hardware. But let me ask you something: Where do you plan on going with your GNU Radio journey? ;) Are you a HAM trying to get into software radio, do you have any RF or communications engineering background, and how familiar are you with software development or programming in general?
[00:09:14] <timelessness[m]> OK. I got my technicians HAM license a few years ago, although I never did anything with it. I do not have engineering background. I find the whole radio and radio waves and communication thing very interesting. 
[00:09:14] <timelessness[m]> Now I am studing to take my pilots license and radio communication came up again. Which once again spiked my interest, so I did some research online...and came to the conclusion that HackerRF was the best use of my money to learn and enjoy this niche, and that GNU Radio was the best platform. 
[00:09:14] <timelessness[m]> I suppose you can say I am a HAM trying to get into software radio....that would be accurate
[00:10:03] <timelessness[m]> I do not have any programming background unfortunately 
[00:10:10] <Yamakaja[m]> Also, i'm not familiar with the works of Paul Clark, but it will be difficulty for books to keep up with GNU Radios develpoment, and i do not suggest you start with GNU Radio 3.8 if you don't have a good reason to. There are lots of resources online on using GNU Radio 3.9, including the GNU Radio tutorials: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Tutorials
[00:11:02] <timelessness[m]> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1536814768/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
[00:11:30] <timelessness[m]> I read that 3.8 is more stable? what do I know...
[00:11:41] <Yamakaja[m]> That's unfortunate. You see, GNU Radio should be understood as a software development framework more than a point and click GUI. So to get a good idea of what's going on, a programming background really does help
[00:12:13] <Yamakaja[m]> timelessness: Well, it is quite an old release by now - but if "stable" means "doesn't change as much", then yes, of course :D
[00:12:41] <Yamakaja[m]> To quote patchvonbraun : "Gnu Radio is effectively a domain-specific programming environment, rather than a "radio with a lot of knobs".  If radio, signals, signal-processing, and software-development and computer programming are all simultaneously mysteries, then you have several hard hills to climb I'm afraid."
[00:13:48] <timelessness[m]> well...if someone like myself...has some time but not tons of time...has NO programming background.....wants to use the software but does not want a long learning curve...and also prefers reading clear information not something fulled with jargon...what do you suggest?
[00:14:28] <Yamakaja[m]> Depends on what you want to achieve, do you just want to listen to some radio stations, atc and stuff like that? Use applications like gqrx
[00:14:53] <DerekKozel[m]> Have you used software like SDR++ or SDR#, or maybe SDRAngel? 
[00:15:24] <timelessness[m]> Yamakaja, what I wouldnt mind communicating and not just listening....I would like to do more....but what are objectives typically are there with newbies like myself entering NGU?
[00:15:39] <timelessness[m]> DerekKozel[m]: nope....im so foreign 
[00:15:48] <timelessness[m]> foreign to this world...but I want to learn
[00:16:13] <timelessness[m]> I like learning new things but not if it is overly technical and dry and slow
[00:16:57] <DerekKozel[m]> I'd recommend trying some of those, they're good starting places to learn a lot of the concepts and then when you find something that those programs can't do GNU Radio can be the tool you use to add that ability
[00:16:58] <timelessness[m]> everyone has got to start somewhere...

[00:17:40] <DerekKozel[m]> Yep! I'm a ham too and software like that is where I got my start
[00:17:47] <timelessness[m]> aha
[00:17:48] <DerekKozel[m]> MW0LNA
[00:17:50] <jogn_1[m]> timelessness[m]: No worries - I’m in the same boat as you. I don’t have an HAM license or anything like that, so I guess you’re more a head of me hehe. Have you looked at those HackRF tutorials, since you said you had ordered it and it didn’t arrive? https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/ 
[00:21:26] <timelessness[m]> I haven't looked much at hacker, although I bet I will when it arrives...i was focused on reviews comparing the various radios...and how great this particular one is
[00:22:26] <timelessness[m]> Oh I started listening Michael Ossmann...yes,...but didnt get too far
[00:22:44] <timelessness[m]> I thought I would listen to all his videos but it got a little dry for me...so I starting looking elsewhere
[00:23:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> If one examines the block diagram of a typical radio receiver, for example, each of those blocks can be described by a fairly-precise mathematical expression (or system of expressions).  In the analog world, generally the higher the "quality" of that block, the more-closely it adheres to the math that describes its idealized behavior.   Once you realize that, then DSP begins to make a lot of sense.
[00:23:21] <timelessness[m]> I wish I could stick to things...and see them through to the end....i am trying to do that with my piloting and would like to do that here too!
[00:24:07] *** Joins: OnAironaut (~OnAir@user/onaironaut)
[00:24:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> timelessness: Maybe you are more of the kind of person who needs to use a pre-built *application* that uses DSP, and maybe Gnu Radio underneath.  
[00:25:09] <timelessness[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: what would you recommend?
[00:25:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> The problem is that given that the set "interesting and useful things that one might do at the interesction of radio and computers" is probably infinite.  Which means that no application will ever embody all of them.
[00:25:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> timelessness: Gqrx, SDR++, SDRAngel, etc, etc.   
[00:26:15] <timelessness[m]> of those, which is best of all?
[00:26:23] <timelessness[m]> I know each will have pros and cons...but still
[00:26:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> There are FAR more applications that are in the space I'd describe as "Casual Airwave Surfing" than those that actually allow you to transmit.
[00:26:43] <Yamakaja[m]> There is no "best of all", there is only a set of good applications for a specific task :/
[00:27:29] <timelessness[m]> is there a list somewhere of many of the applicatoins out there that utulize GNU with a discussion about each ones purpose, extent of usage, help etc.?
[00:27:53] <Yamakaja[m]> In your case, you might be served well with those that patchvonbraun just mentioned. I suggest you play around with them and figure out how they compare, and what you'd rather do in which application ;)
[00:28:19] <timelessness[m]> By the way, isnt hackrrf an example of a pre built application with gnu underneath?
[00:28:46] <Yamakaja[m]> No, the HackRF is a hardware peripheral and just provides samples to GNU Radio or similar applications. The software processing is separate
[00:29:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> timelessness: NO!  It's just a piece of SDR *hardware*.  Gnu Radio knows how to "drive" it, as do other applications--some built on top of Gnu Radio, some "naked".
[00:31:09] <timelessness[m]> Am I able to use GNU radio alone without hackerRF or similar to access all the various bands of radio?
[00:31:16] <jogn_1[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "timelessness: Gqrx, SDR++, SDRAn..." <- Just wondering myself, what could these be used for? Is it just for general use, like giving you a view of the signal, or can these come in help if you're trying to do more complex stuff like measuring and transmitting?
[00:31:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> The thing about SDR *hardware* is that such hardware is at the same time eye-wateringly "smart", and "dumb as a bag of hammers" at the same time.   Very high tech, but they have no idea that they're any *particular* type of radio system.
[00:31:44] *** Quits: vassenn (~vassen@178.35.100.90) (Quit: Good bye!)
[00:32:43] <DerekKozel[m]> jogn_1[m]: most are receive only, but give you a few views of the raw signals as well as ways to decode them to audio, text messages, images or video
[00:33:04] <DerekKozel[m]> SDRAngel notable includes transmitting all of those too
[00:33:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> jogn_1[m]: To the extent that one needs to understand what signals LOOK like, those apps can be of some help.  I personally use them only rarely.  But I have very specific needs, and when I need a "laboratory instrument", I often just build one quickly in Gnu Radio, or, you know, use a physical laboratory instrument.

[00:34:47] <timelessness[m]> thank you guys. very helpful to a newbie like myself because it is so easy to go in the wrong direction if you dont even know how to read the signposts
[00:35:02] <timelessness[m]> ive been taking notes for myself...
[00:35:34] <timelessness[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: do you mind explaining what specific things you use GNU for?
[00:36:08] <jogn_1[m]> timelessness[m]: We all start somewhere, listen I'm in the same boat as you, I joined 3 hours ago. Just being here, I learnt alot from talking to people.
[00:36:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> timelessness: To be clear GNU == An Umbrella for a bunch of different Open Source TOols.    *Gnu Radio* is what we talke about here.
[00:36:44] <timelessness[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Ok, I mean GNU radio
[00:37:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> timelessness: My own uses of Gnu Radio occupy a quite-modest corner of its functionality.  I'm a part-time radio astronomer, so I tend to build tools that are useful in that space.   But I've also built things like broadcast FM receivers with RDS, stereo-demux, etc.  APT satellite weather receivers.   Mostly so I can teach myself things, but also to share.
[00:38:23] <DerekKozel[m]> :) have some fun with stuff and please do hang around or come back
[00:38:44] <DerekKozel[m]> I suggest joining #HamRadio:gnuradio.org 
[00:38:54] <timelessness[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: super kool
[00:39:28] <DerekKozel[m]> It's a bit quiet day to day but we sometimes run Amateur Radio casual meetups talking about SDR and GNU Radio
[00:39:31] <timelessness[m]> DerekKozel[m]: I hope to. thanks for the suggestion
[00:40:43] <jogn_1[m]> dkozel[m]: Now that's cool. I wish they had online conferences for SDR related stuff, I know there's one for embedded already.
[00:41:03] <DerekKozel[m]> We do! 
[00:41:11] <jogn_1[m]> We do?!
[00:41:26] <jogn_1[m]> Have I been missing out haha. Where can I find that? :P
[00:41:36] <DerekKozel[m]> Check out the last 7+ years of the GNU Radio conference on YouTube. 
[00:42:10] <jogn_1[m]> Thanks - will definitely check it out!
[00:42:17] <DerekKozel[m]> The last two years we added livestreaming, virtual RF capture the flag, workshops, tutorials etx
[00:43:01] <jogn_1[m]> dkozel[m]: Now thats pretty impressive, you have sold me haha 😂
[00:43:31] <Yamakaja[m]> https://www.youtube.com/c/GNURadioProject/videos
[00:44:03] <DerekKozel[m]> And we're far from alone. DSPRelated does one or two virtual conferences
[00:44:28] <DerekKozel[m]> There's SDRAcademy which is all hams, then GNU Radio Days Europe
[00:44:48] <timelessness[m]> What about an actual, real conference or event..have those ever been done on the east coast? 
[00:44:51] <DerekKozel[m]> Oh! And the FOSDEM Free Software Radio event is in 3 weeks! 
[00:45:04] <Yamakaja[m]> Sure, but not with COVID :/
[00:45:13] <DerekKozel[m]> Yep! 2020 was the only year pure virtual

[00:49:21] <DerekKozel[m]> patchvonbraun: We're definitely keeping COVID in mind, but last year we had 100 in-person and 600+ virtual and no reports of illness.
[00:50:27] <DerekKozel[m]> Fingers crossed this year is at least as possible, but we are certainly making plans with the less good scenarios in mind.
[00:50:37] <drmpeg> Bu that was a lull in COVID.
[00:50:49] <Yamakaja[m]> As long as everybody is vaccinated and wears a damn mask, the chance of catching covid is furtunately rather slim. In Germany we have lecture halls full of students under those circumstances and it hasn't gone horribly wrong yet :D
[00:52:02] <Crofton[m]> drmpeg: Our crystal balls are very cloudy, making the best decisions we can.
[00:52:40] <DerekKozel[m]> Yep, full vaccination and masks were mandatory. We'll update this years requirements based on the CDC and best conservative future fortune telling. shrug
[00:53:25] <DerekKozel[m]> With all the virtual infrastructure in place to either run Hybrid or fall back hard if there's a really severe change close to the time.

[00:53:42] <jogn_1[m]> <dkozel[m]> "And we're far from alone..." <- They do yeah. I have watched embedded conferences (same event-organizers) and they do a great job. The DSP one could have been better though.
