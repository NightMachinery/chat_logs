[00:54:38] <stanrifkin> lf94: sounds good to me
[00:55:20] <isekaijin> The wedge product is the multiplication of the so-called “exterior algebra”, which is the direct sum [space of 0-vectors] (+) [space of 1-vectors] (+) [space of 2-vectors] (+) ...
[00:55:43] <nagefire> My texts only define wedge products for alternating forms, and from what I gather the wedge product (of k-vectors) is defined as the unique binary operator on the space of k-vectors that satisfies the same properties as its dual
[00:55:55] <isekaijin> The wedge product of a k-vector and an l-vector is a (k+l)-vector.
[00:57:01] <dila> does the chinese remainder theorem give a multiplicative as well as a additive isomoprhism from Z/pqz to Z/pZ x Z/qZ?
[00:57:23] <nagefire> so, integration of differential forms does not sum over oriented volumes, it is a measure of how the alternating form (of the differential form) deforms the tangent space at each point over the region/submanifold of integration?
[00:58:57] <dude12312414> dila: Z/(pqZ) is isomorphic to Z/pZ x Z/qZ as rings

[01:09:59] <isekaijin> nagefire: Why would it be a measure of deformation? To me, intuitively, a smooth manifold comes with something like an “infinitesimal triangulation”, where each “infinitesinal simplex” is literally flat, i.e., literally part of some R^n. (Of course, this is not formal.)
[01:10:22] <isekaijin> And an integral is just a normal sum, with each summand defined on an infinitesimal piece.
[01:11:24] <dila> isekaijin: is that the rieman definition? i think there are others
[01:12:25] <isekaijin> dila: It's not really a mathematical definition, it's just how I visualize it sometimes.
[01:15:24] <nagefire> If we consider the tangent space at a point p in the manifold, then a differential form f at p is an alternating form over this tangent space. An alternating form applies some linear transformation to the k-vectors of this tangent space and measures the unit volume of the resulting transform.
[01:15:48] <nagefire> This is what I mean by deformation
[01:16:59] <nagefire> It looks like integration of forms is defined a little differently in modern texts (mine is 70 years old) so that it's just the Riemann integral of the scalar function f: M -> F given by applying the differential form to each point of the region

[01:20:31] <nagefire> We visualize integration as summing over k-volumes, but computationally it sums over local deformations to give us some sense of the global properties of a differential form

[02:22:52] <Guest1778> I tried the transform: k1 -> k^2 / k2^~ and k2 -> k k1^~ / k2^~. I get the same delta function, but everything else doesn't match!

[02:37:41] <PlanckWalk> Just tryign to wotk out what you mean
[02:37:48] <PlanckWalk> Yu have an x such that p(x) =0
[02:38:07] <PlanckWalk> Let's say, p(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6  just for example
[02:38:44] <PlanckWalk> You have x=2.  What's the next step?
[02:39:01] <dila> divide p(x) by x-2
[02:39:10] <PlanckWalk> Okay, you have x-3
[02:39:22] <dila> ok, so now i have x-3 = 0 to solve
[02:39:24] <PlanckWalk> What relation does that have to p'(x)?
[02:39:33] <dila> that is p'(x) in the example
[02:39:44] <PlanckWalk> p'(x) = 2x - 5
[02:39:51] <dila> yes

[02:40:47] <PlanckWalk> I asked "What relation does x-3 have to p'(x)"
[02:40:58] <PlanckWalk> You said "that is p'(x) in the example"
[02:41:09] <PlanckWalk> Then agreed that p'(x) = 2x-5
[02:41:10] <dila> ok i see the problem
[02:41:41] <dila> i added a ' to p(x) each time i removed a root, so deg p'' = deg p - 2
[02:42:02] <PlanckWalk> So the ' is just a prime symbol and not a formal derivative?

[02:42:59] <dila> the question was dumb anyway, i'll ask better questions next time
[02:43:43] <dila> as you said at first p(x) = 0 holds after substituting x
[02:44:02] <dila> otherwise the equality is wrong

[03:40:33] <yashi> well I want a function f:R->R that is constant -1 below -1, constant +1 after +1, and in between interpolates in a differentiable (but not smooth) way.
[03:42:21] <yashi> maybe even twice differentiable.
[03:43:11] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:44:52] <isekaijin> Then piecewise polynomial is certainly good enough. Use a polynomial f(x) such that f(-1) = -1, f(1) = 1, f'(-1) = f'(1) = f''(-1) = f''(1) = 0.
[03:45:36] *** Joins: Arcorann (~A@user/arcorann)
[03:45:41] <yashi> but isn't that impossible? a polynomial is analytic, its derivative is analytic too, but an analytic non-constant function can't have compact support.
[03:46:01] <isekaijin> Errr, of course your function isn't going to be f(x) itself.
[03:46:13] <isekaijin> Your function is going to be g(x) = f(x) only for x \in [-1,1].
[03:46:25] <isekaijin> Then g(x) = -1 for x < -1, and g(x) = 1 for x > 1.
[03:46:51] <isekaijin> The conditions on f guarantee that g is twice differentiable.
[03:46:57] <yashi> but I want it to be everywhere twice differentiable
[03:47:20] <yashi> oh ok
[03:47:20] <yashi> hrmm
[03:47:29] <yashi> let me try to solve that
[03:47:40] <yashi> i guess it's going to be of degree two?
[03:48:02] <isekaijin> No.
[03:48:13] <isekaijin> It's going to be degree higher than 2.
[03:48:22] <isekaijin> For one, f(x) is likely to be an odd function.
[03:48:59] <isekaijin> So you should look for a polynomial with only terms of odd degree. At least it would make the search slightly simpler.

[03:52:33] <PlanckWalk> If you want to match both value and derivative at both endpoints, in general it will need to be cubic

[03:53:26] <PlanckWalk> If you want to match the second derivative as well, quintic
[03:53:28] <isekaijin> Then let's see what we get.

[03:54:37] <isekaijin> f''(1) = 6b + 20c = 0

[05:55:46] <PlanckWalk> E.g. quasigroups and Moufang loops and things
[05:56:13] <[itchyjunk]> in haskell, they say things are right associative a->b->c is the same as (a->(b->c)) but associativity should mean (a->b)->c is the same as a->(b->c) ?

[06:08:06] <[itchyjunk]> from the little i understand, doing math on computer is harder than paper and pen stuff
[06:08:27] <mycroftiv> not for me, i wasnt really able to do well with pen and paper, maybe because my mind has this disorganized quality

[06:13:21] <mycroftiv> it makes sense but as usual with wolfram its not new and doesnt do that much
[06:13:32] <mycroftiv> makes a ton of fancy pictures, has nice concepts though i think
[06:13:54] <[itchyjunk]> oh there is correspondence btween HoTT and wolfram model?
[06:13:59] <[itchyjunk]> interesting
[06:14:00] <mycroftiv> but the standard line on wolfram is that hes taking fairly standard ideas and selling them as Wolfram Brand (TM)
[06:14:11] <[itchyjunk]> but since he claims there is a computational model of the universe, guess it's not surprisng?

[06:15:22] <mycroftiv> in some ways it sounds all fancier than it is
[06:15:53] <mycroftiv> you can put all this categorical and homotopy type theory language on top of how things can be equal to other things in fairly standard bijective isomorphism way
[06:16:33] <mycroftiv> but its still interesting work i think, these ideas about looking at topological structure of proof space as computational model of quantum processes arent terrible

[11:53:40] <greenbagels> node1: i am no expert in formal set theory, so i dont know how much on the actual foundations i can comment, but what i will say is this
[11:54:07] <greenbagels> there are definitely some formal considerations for what possibilities there are for elements of a set
[11:55:02] <greenbagels> but i think that, even with this consideration, everyday usage of sets usually assumes something more than what i imagine this formal restriction would be
[11:55:47] <greenbagels> like usually, when we talk about sets, trying to take some set X = {blue, 5, Albert Einstein} is not a particularly useful set, even if it is "valid" in some sort of sense
[11:58:02] <greenbagels> but X = {2, 2.5, 3} seems more believable as a "reasonable" set
[11:58:42] <node1> Yes, but what my understanding says that these element must have some common similarity or any specific intention to group it inside { } i.e why we call it set

[12:29:33] <joel135> mycroftiv: are you good with ordinals? i assume so. i have an idea for an extended definition: let k be an ordinal. a "dual k-ordinal" o is a linearly ordered set such that for any ordinal j, if there is an order-reversing injection j -> o, then j < k. when k = ω we get the usual ordinals unless i'm mistaken.

[15:28:51] <Simplar> then find zeros
[15:28:53] *** Joins: savask (~savask@Powder/Developer/savask)
[15:28:55] <isekaijin> Not that simple.
[15:29:02] <Simplar> ...I knew there is a catch XD
[15:29:06] <isekaijin> Put f(x) = 8t^3 + 4t^2 - 85 - 5.
[15:29:20] <isekaijin> Argh, put f(x) = 8t^3 + 4t^2 - 8t - 5.
[15:29:27] <Simplar> f(x) = 8x^3+4x^2-8x+5
[15:29:31] <Simplar> to be formally correct
[15:29:41] <Simplar> we have x as an argument after all
[15:29:46] <isekaijin> Oh, I thought I was writing f(t).
[15:29:48] <isekaijin> My bad.
[15:29:50] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[15:29:51] <Simplar> np!
[15:29:55] <isekaijin> Then f'(t) = 24t^2 + 8t - 8.
[15:30:16] *** Joins: PJBoy (~PJBoy@user/pjboy)
[15:30:18] <isekaijin> Okay, then f'(t) is negative for some values of t.
[15:30:21] <moon-child> would have to find the zeroes of the derivative, evaluate the function at those zeroes, and evaluate the derivate right outside of the range covered by the zeroes
[15:30:23] <moon-child> right?
[15:30:27] <isekaijin> Which means that f(t) is decreasing in some range.
[15:30:44] <Simplar> Understandable so far
[15:30:53] <isekaijin> moon-child: I just want to find how many times the graph of f(t) crosses the t axis.
[15:31:13] <isekaijin> Actually, we can find f'(t)'s zeros quite easily, since it's a quadratic equation.
[15:31:39] <Simplar> Of course
[15:32:01] <Simplar> D = 81 + 4*24*8, thus D > 0, 2 real roots
[15:32:36] <isekaijin> I would actually find the zeroes of (1/8) f'(t) = 3t^2 + t - 1, to keep the numbers small.
[15:33:22] <Simplar> I'd actually used a method
[15:33:26] <isekaijin> So [-1 \pm sqrt(13)] / 2.
[15:33:35] <Simplar> ...ah, okay, makes sense
[15:33:38] <isekaijin> Assuming I didn't make any calculation mistakes.
[15:33:50] <cherim> You can find the number of real roots on a given interval for any degree polynomial using only rational algebraic manipulations, no root finding
[15:33:58] <isekaijin> Mmm.

[15:40:03] <Simplar> That means we don't have any real roots at (0;1)
[15:40:44] <Simplar> So basically, according to Sturm...

[19:31:06] <qbt> I'm proving that a morphism f:X -> Y of affine varieties is injective iff the corresponding K-algebra homomorphism f*:A(Y) -> A(X) is surjective. Already showed that f* surjective implies f injective. Any ideas on how to proceed to show the converse?

[19:38:18] <Z-module> cheater, I really like the two books by Konrad Knopp, that he wrote in German and both were translated to English. "Infinite Sequences and Series" is the shorter one, all the basic stuff is there, very clear. There's a much longer "Theory and Applications of Infinite Series" with zillions of obscure extra things in it, and a lot of nice exercises.

[20:53:00] <Gurkenglas> nlab says the presheaves C^op->Set freely add colimits to C. I'd expect you'd do this by adding a formal colimit to C for every diagram. But when I look for a presheaf that corresponds to a diagram, I find the presheaf of cones, not cocones. What am I missing?
[20:53:29] <mycroftiv> gurkenglas: good question, please explain to me when you figure it out :)

[20:56:14] <mycroftiv> gurkenglas: also in particular filtered colimits from presheaves of various things, how that relates to the cones or cocones or snocones, and what the double-negation sheafification does
[20:57:28] *** Joins: qu4nt1n (~qu4nt1n@78.198.214.34)
[20:59:59] <Gurkenglas> If everything were neat, I suppose the answer to my question would be that that presheaf of cones can in fact be seen as the formal colimit. Let's see. It should be a cocone: There should be a morphism of presheaves from each diagram-object's representable presheaf. In fact if you can consume that diagram-object you can consume the tip of the cone. Okay, looks like this just works :)
[21:02:14] <mycroftiv> gurkenglas: thanks, cant confirm or deny any of that, but i appreciate you sharing your analysis

[22:40:15] <dude12312414> Z-module is right that you can't directly use Euler's theorem because 16 isn't coprime to 100 so the sequence 16^x (mod 100) isn't exactly periodic

[23:35:01] <cheater> you don't include references where you got the theorems from?
[23:35:44] <Simplar> cheater: I want to include references to works or books I've found them in
[23:35:53] <Simplar> And work from there to find their source
[23:36:08] <Simplar> Books themselves have references
[23:36:18] <cheater> sure
[23:36:38] <Simplar> Bonus point is I'll have myself familiar with the world's math
[23:37:35] <stanrifkin> Simplar: isn't there wikipedia?

[23:44:25] <cheater> any suggestions? i need to put labels on my book cases... to organize the books... i want to use some tape, but i don't want it to peel, and on the other hand i don't want it to leave behind a smudge. something like those extra-strong post it notes is the right kind of glue, but they're not tape. i considered painter's tape but that peels after some time.
[23:44:43] <APic> Get a Brother Label Writer
[23:45:08] <APic> Ok, moar at Topic for #not-math
[23:45:20] *** Parts: dila (~dila@199.247.9.204) (thanks)
[23:46:18] <cheater> classifying maths books is on topic
[23:48:07] <Simplar> Classifying math lemmas too
