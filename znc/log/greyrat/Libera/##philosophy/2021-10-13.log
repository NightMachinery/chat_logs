[04:38:07] <manicennui> Some used book stores will take them.
[04:38:13] <manicennui> Might even pay you a bit.
[04:38:34] <manicennui> Several years ago I had to take a bunch of books out to a library in the suburbs.
[04:42:06] <plankster> i sold most of my CD collection the other day
[04:42:11] <plankster> felt kinda good
[04:42:19] <plankster> those were some quality CDs
[04:48:18] <manicennui> I got rid of my CD collection years ago, and now I'm slowly rebuilding it.
[04:49:46] <plankster> yeah. rebuilding it weirder over here
[04:50:02] <plankster> the kinda stuff you cant just find on youtube
[04:51:37] <manicennui> I don't get using YT for music.
[04:51:46] <manicennui> I'll watch a music video once in a while.
[04:51:51] <manicennui> And I have spotify.
[04:52:07] <manicennui> But I hate relying on the Internet for such things and kind of like having physical media.
[04:52:23] <manicennui> There are also things that are difficult to find outside of import CDs.

[07:14:50] <biys> i think it's weird that we still study shakespeare
[07:15:04] <biys> it's like suggesting that throughout time there's never been a better writer
[07:15:44] <biys> but the thing about that is...  if we're forcing people to study old literature to understand the world, they're understanding of the world will be formulated based on their study of that old literature
[07:17:34] <biys> it seems like it's more-so a matter of tradition than anything else at this point
[07:17:43] <causative> yes, we study Shakespeare entirely because of social status considerations
[07:17:58] <biys> there's certains ideas and concepts that are portrayed that we feel deserve to be discussed
[07:18:21] <biys> why?  because they've always been discussed
[07:18:29] <causative> he was revered, in the past, so in the present people gain status by saying they study Shakespeare and revering him
[07:18:54] <causative> high-status individuals result in others wanting to associate with the high-status individuals, raising their status even more, in a feedback cycle
[07:18:54] <biys> that might be part of it
[07:19:14] <biys> i would say that instead there's a particular narrative that's being taught
[07:19:18] <biys> about how to think about the world
[07:19:20] <biys> how to operate in the world
[07:19:48] <biys> if everyone reads the same book and is taught to look at it the same way
[07:19:49] <biys> well...
[07:19:56] <biys> we might as well all just be christians!
[07:20:02] <causative> and it helps that Shakespeare's language is now largely inscrutable, or at least difficult to read, for modern students - "if it's hard to understand it must be very important"
[07:21:21] <causative> all of this is bullshit, of course. The real merit of a work comes from its content, the claims it makes - not the social reverence surrounding it or the level of inscrutability in it
[07:22:27] <biys> sure
[07:23:16] *** Joins: Null_A (~null_a@2601:645:8700:2290:cca9:9e4e:f1d8:3489)
[07:24:44] <biys> i reject your reality and substitute my own.  it's a conspiracy
[07:26:14] <causative> the inscrutability dynamic goes like - "I understand this because I have studied it long and hard. You don't understand it yet. Therefore, your status is lower than mine, and you can aspire to my status by studying this inscrutable work, until you can claim the same as I do."
[07:26:33] <causative> it's the same thing that cults do when they reserve sacred mysteries for the higher levels of the cult
[07:26:51] <biys> haha
[07:27:08] <biys> i like that
[07:28:50] <causative> it's legitimate if the thing being understood is designed to be understood easily, and understanding it actually lets you do useful or valuable things that you couldn't do before you understood
[07:28:53] <biys> there's more than just reading the text though.  with hamlet i need to understand catholics
[07:29:22] <biys> for example, i would have never know what pergatory was had i not read hamlet
[07:29:28] <causative> it's illegitimate if the thing being understood is difficult to understand because it uses opaque or archaic language
[07:29:32] <biys> actually i didn't know what it was because i read hamlet
[07:29:38] <biys> i had to figure out what it was because i read hamlet
[07:35:58] <causative> I guess you do learn some things about renaissance Europe if you read Shakespeare
[07:37:26] <biys> i wouldn't say only by reading shakespeare
[07:37:33] <biys> you'd likely have to read other sources as well
[07:37:54] <biys> if you were to simply read shakespeare it is unlikely a person would understand simply with that text
