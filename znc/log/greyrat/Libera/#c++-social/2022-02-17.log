[22:54:22] <Xardas> thats a good comb for me
[23:08:23] <T`aZ> or drop python as soon as possible because staticaly checked languages > *
[23:09:59] <Zogatribe> python is toy
[23:10:08] <Zogatribe> C is hard work
[23:10:14] <Zogatribe> C++ is optimal
[23:11:17] <MaNI> people talking positively about c++ in a c++ channel, what weird parallel dimension have I landed in
[23:13:16] <Xardas> I think there's this pack of languages that are essential to have
[23:13:25] <Xardas> Python is one of them
[23:14:03] <Zogatribe> python is a bit rubbish with its whitespace nonsense
[23:14:34] <Xardas> People do machine learning with python
[23:14:40] <Xardas> Ai and deep learning
[23:14:44] <Xardas> neural networks
[23:14:54] <Xardas> software dev aswell
[23:15:07] <Xardas> I find it very hard to do all those things without python
[23:15:46] <Xardas> Zogatribe Do you mean indentation ?
[23:23:56] <Zogatribe> Xardas: yes
[23:24:24] <Xardas> That actually improves readability
[23:25:05] <Zogatribe> Xardas: the reason people use python for AI, deep learning and neural networks is because people are relying on python modules written mostly in C++, Python is just used for gluing things together; Python is little more than a scripting language
[23:26:15] <Zogatribe> Python also contributes to climate change more than any other programming language as it is very slow and inefficient
[23:28:21] <Xardas> you got a point there
[23:28:55] <Xardas> Well, I also see python as a tool
[23:29:30] <Zogatribe> I will be implementing it at some point
[23:29:41] <Xardas> As you already know...there isn't much cpp jobs out there compared to python
[23:29:42] <TheFlash> Isn't every programmin language a tool? At least useful ones.
[23:30:01] <Xardas> Although I love cpp
[23:30:10] <Xardas> and I do cpp everyday
[23:30:14] <Xardas> even more than python
[23:30:38] <TheFlash> I did Python at work today (does not happen often). I didn't like it.
[23:30:40] <Zogatribe> just because there are more python jobs than cpp jobs it doesn't follow that there isn't much cpp jobs
[23:31:56] <Xardas> Do you guys wok with c++ ?
[23:32:10] <Xardas> work*
[23:32:31] <Zogatribe> my day job is C++
[23:32:56] <TheFlash> I wok vegies with C++ :D
[23:33:17] <TheFlash> Yeah, C++ is what I normally write at work.
[23:34:13] <Xardas> That's awesome :D
[23:34:23] <Xardas> Which frameworks then ?
[23:34:46] <TheFlash> Our company has internal behemoth called "framework" =)
[23:34:49] <Xardas> How can I land a job as a c++ dev like you guys ?
[23:34:50] <Zogatribe> boost, Qt for GUI but I hate Qt which is why I am going to destroy it
[23:35:54] <Xardas> Qt seems old
[23:36:05] <TheFlash> I use very little external libraries at work. There's big bunch of internal ones. And there's little bit of NIH attitued around as well.

[23:39:19] <TheFlash> Not invented here => Let's not use it
[23:42:54] <TheFlash> I actually like it when there's some ammount of "maybe it fits our needs better if we do it our self", but they take that to extreme.
[23:43:47] <Xardas> Oh I see
[23:44:11] <TheFlash> It's getting better, but its still there.
[23:44:16] <Xardas> They make their own framework and keep it for themselves
[23:45:07] <TheFlash> The "framework" is something that also some of our customers use. And some other suppliers of our customers.
