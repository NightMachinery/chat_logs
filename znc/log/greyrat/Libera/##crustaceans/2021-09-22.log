[00:24:39] <Brekkjern> I don't actually mean that, but I couldn't let the opportunity to make that joke pass :P
[00:25:50] <gerikson> lol goodger why do you know my birthday
[00:27:51] <goodger> I wrote it down last year
[00:29:12] <gerikson> thanks
[00:29:18] <gerikson> I should reciprocate
[00:29:22] <dimadima> i also note ppl's birthdays whenever they are mentioned and then surprise them (aka creep them out) with that knowledge
[00:29:36] <dimadima> happy birthday gerikson

[00:44:08] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Anything that isn't threadsafe would do I think
[00:44:16] <manicennui> heh
[00:44:39] <manicennui> Jobs where you mostly just code are either very niche or you are going to have very limited career growth.
[00:45:08] <Brekkjern> Possibly, but that all depends
[00:45:32] <Brekkjern> For now I am rather happy with the place I work. Money is good enough, and I can goof off with new tech a lot

[05:06:31] <buttsbot> pools starting to boil like a kettle, after a volcano erupts near them : interestingasfuck
[05:06:53] <dimadima> gwozniak: may i ask which one? is it proprietary?
[05:07:13] <dimadima> i'm wondering whether propietary c/c++ compilers exist and if so: why
[05:07:40] <dimadima> (so which one in particular is not even interesting to me so much as why)
[05:07:48] <manicennui> They do.
[05:08:08] <dimadima> given that gcc and clang exist
[05:08:13] <gwozniak> Oh, they certainly exist
[05:08:23] <gwozniak> I work on XC32, a compiler from Microchip
[05:08:28] <gwozniak> It's actually based on GCC
[05:08:43] <gwozniak> Whether it will remain that way is unknown
[05:09:08] <dimadima> you mean whether you will continue working there or whether it'll keep existing
[05:09:26] <gwozniak> There is IAR, Keil, and Greenhills for proprietary compilers, to name a few
[05:09:43] <gwozniak> Unknown if it will remain as based on GCC
[05:10:00] <gwozniak> It will definitely be around for a while :)
[05:10:02] <manicennui> Define "proprietary".
[05:10:06] <manicennui> Does the Intel compiler count?
[05:10:19] <gwozniak> Yeah, I think so
[05:11:05] <gwozniak> Proprietary in the sense you have to pay a license to use them. I think all the ones I mentioned use that model
[05:11:24] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C_compilers
[05:11:25] <buttsbot> List of compilers - Wikipedia
[05:11:52] <gwozniak> They are mostly meant to target microcontrollers of various architectures, some being quite old
[05:12:43] <dimadima> yeah i meant that you have to pay to use them
[05:13:05] <dimadima> i had no idea such things existed give my reasoning above
[05:13:07] <dimadima> given*
[05:13:34] <gwozniak> Clang/LLVM is actually not that great for code size, which is the key concern of microcontrollers
[05:13:41] <dimadima> but i guess GCC/clang only support certain archs and these other ones support others?
[05:14:25] <dimadima> gwozniak: code size in terms of input or output
[05:14:31] <gwozniak> It can also be integration with IDEs that come with them
[05:14:33] <manicennui> dimadima: It's not just that. Sometimes the commercial compilers produce better machine code.
[05:14:41] <dimadima> sorry for all the questions this is just realy interesting
[05:14:46] <gwozniak> dimadima: code size of the executable produced
[05:14:47] <manicennui> Not sure how true that still is for the Intel compiler.
[05:14:47] <dimadima> manicennui: far out
[05:15:16] <dimadima> i would have thought between gcc/clang, you'd get the best results, but clearly i am wrong!
[05:15:50] <dimadima> microchip is also a fantastic name for a company, damn
[05:16:30] <gwozniak> GCC is pretty good with respect to code size and speed.  It's not as easy to extend as Clang/LLVM though
[05:16:33] <dimadima> so looking at https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers
[05:16:33] <buttsbot> MPLAB® XC Compilers | Microchip Technology
[05:16:55] <gwozniak> Clang has a much better architecture, from a development standpoint
[05:17:03] <gwozniak> dimadima: yes, that's me
[05:17:04] <dimadima> it seems the product is free or at least free for some cases, but the cases it supports are the cases of the Microchip company
[05:17:19] <gwozniak> You need a license to use higher optimization levels
[05:17:20] <manicennui> I'm sure that some of these compilers offer certain support or features that some development requires too.
[05:17:46] <manicennui> Companies and the government love to pay for free things.
[05:17:53] <gwozniak> We have extended the linker in various ways, and support some new attributes
[05:17:53] <dimadima> yeah, i see "Need to optimize your code-size reduction or get better speed from your project’s software? PRO licenses are available to unlock the full potential of the MPLAB XC C Compiler’s advanced-level optimizations. "
[05:18:08] <gwozniak> Marketing speak, of course
[05:18:37] <dimadima> very cool, thank you
[05:19:40] <gwozniak> IBM's XL compiler (what I worked on before my current job) is pretty much the only compiler to target the z architecture, although GCC does now, and maybe Clang too
[05:19:57] <gwozniak> Some of the optimizations done by XL are intense
[05:20:21] <dimadima> and z arch is mainframe?
[05:20:32] <dimadima> i can google that "
[05:20:55] <dimadima> yes google confirms :)
[05:21:08] <gwozniak> Yeah, z is the arch of the mainframes. Still runs code from the late 1960s
[05:21:27] <dimadima> but that wouldn't b c code would it
[05:21:31] <dimadima> fortran? cobol?
[05:21:46] <dimadima> (c wasn't invented until the early 70s i believe)
[05:21:56] <gwozniak> I mean object code
[05:22:12] <dimadima> heh
[05:22:30] <gwozniak> There are a not insignificant number of mainframe customers who no longer have source code, but still run the object code
[05:22:37] <dimadima> wild. always love reminders of what a big world it is out there
[05:22:45] <dimadima> amazing
[05:22:50] <dimadima> lost the source code, have object code
[05:23:09] <dimadima> they know what it does, could maybe decompile it (?), and that's fine
[05:23:10] <gwozniak> Which is why this exists: https://www.ibm.com/products/automatic-binary-optimizer-zos

[05:24:18] <dimadima> supporting these guys https://1.cms.s81c.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/customer_story.png
[05:24:21] <dimadima> lol
[05:24:59] <gwozniak> A guy I worked with at IBM would sometimes have to leave the project we were on for a few days to deal with ABO issues.  It was (probably still is) a huge cash cow for IBM
[05:25:35] <dimadima> yes the landing page would suggest that it is
[05:25:39] <gwozniak> He'd been at IBM for about 35 years or so when I worked with him, which was ~4 years ago
[05:26:01] <gwozniak> Most mainframe customers are banks, I think
[05:26:16] <dimadima> crazy town
[05:27:16] <dimadima> i wonder what z/OS is like
[05:27:31] <gwozniak> z/OS and the architecture is really amazing. Too bad it's basically impossible to tinker with it and is so arcane that even if you did, you would get really frustrated
[05:28:00] <gwozniak> I mean, it supports 24-bit, 31-bit and 64-bit addressing
[05:28:01] <dimadima> what is amazing about it
[05:28:08] <dimadima> ah cool
[05:28:18] <gwozniak> The I/O speeds are pretty incredible
[05:28:29] <dimadima> "z/OS has the attributes of modern operating systems, but also retains much of the older functionality originated in the 1960s and still in regular use—z/OS is designed for backward compatibility."
[05:28:41] <gwozniak> And the backwards compatibility is unmatched (if you need it)
[05:28:47] <dimadima> so oracle makes a JVM for it, and probably kills selling it?
[05:29:21] <gwozniak> The thing about z/OS is that you may have to pay for CPU cycles
[05:29:45] <dimadima> huh
[05:30:00] <dimadima> they license it by CPU cycle?
[05:30:10] <dimadima> in some cases ("may")
[05:31:06] <gwozniak> I don't know the model (it was never explained to me) but depending on how you bought the mainframe, some jobs that run on it are charged per CPU cycle used
[05:31:19] <dimadima> but you mean charged to IBM, right?
[05:31:25] <dimadima> not like some internal business thing
[05:31:36] <gwozniak> Yes, charged by IBM
[05:31:46] <gwozniak> Because IBM would own the machine
[05:32:20] <dimadima> the "Because" in that sentence is hilarious because it's not like putting CPU cycles on the machine depreciates it or something
[05:32:36] <dimadima> ...right/
[05:32:38] <gwozniak> There is probably some way that your business would own the machine and charge other business units for CPU time, too
[05:32:51] <dimadima> sure
[05:33:03] <dimadima> your code better be good, you're paying per cycle
[05:33:07] <gwozniak> I don't think many new businesses buy these things
[05:33:16] <dimadima> i can't imagine
[05:33:31] <dimadima> but 30 minutes ago i didn't know there were proprietary C/C++ compilers
[05:33:56] <dimadima> okay i'm going to clean up and work a bit. thanks for blowing my mind gwozniak

[17:32:23] <gerikson> *site
[17:32:23] <ngoldbaum> in grad school the joke always was if a paper gets published in nature then most likely it’s wrong
[17:32:27] <gerikson> whih is still dumb
[17:32:44] <ngoldbaum> just by the nature of what nature publishes they’re more likely to publish iffy but splashy results
[17:33:11] <gerikson> still pretty amazing that it stayed 24hr on the HN front page and there are only a few people pushing back on the author's credentiasl
[17:33:19] <prussian> ya...
[17:33:21] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: lol
[17:33:32] <prussian> I saw it, and like I said, I swerved hard.
[17:34:52] <gerikson> ``Scientific Reports is an open access journal publishing original research from across all areas of the natural sciences, medicine and engineering.''

[17:38:56] <cb> that switching away from apple story sounds like masturbation
[17:39:03] <cb> i expect it to get >50 comments
[17:39:15] <gerikson> weird that that blog has jsut one single entry
[17:39:26] <cb> i didn't check
[17:39:48] <dimadima> i kept seeing this on HN but didn't notice it was Nature. https://twitter.com/NaumerTenney/status/1440129421470482436

[17:40:06] <gerikson> and the author doesn't link to their previous Apple proselytising
[17:40:14] <cb> or the fact he's running arch linux on a thinkpad

[17:41:33] <ngoldbaum> TIL
[17:41:34] <dimadima> gwozniak: you're investigating it, either way
[17:41:41] * ngoldbaum feels vaguely creepy
[17:41:52] <gerikson> cb: also 10 years ago no-one ran macbooks?!
[17:42:08] <gerikson> guess it might have been region-dependent
[17:42:08] <cb> 10 years ago macbooks were popular af for unis and devs
[17:42:22] <cb> i did get slight hints of eastern european
[17:42:28] <cb> super vague tho
[17:42:41] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: esr?
[17:42:46] <gwozniak> dimadima: it can depend. It may be that very few to no one is actually using it
[17:42:48] <cb> eric s. raymond
[17:42:53] <ngoldbaum> if anything macs were more popular 10 years ago
[17:42:54] <cb> he's got his own controversies
[17:43:00] <dimadima> gwozniak: cool
[17:43:13] <ngoldbaum> pre-touchbar days
[17:43:13] <gerikson> ESR: Armed and Dangerous (to the sex drive)
[17:43:19] <cb> yeah, the popular trend on lobsters/hn is to make blog posts saying you're switching from mac to something else (usually a minimalist jackoff linux)
[17:43:21] <dimadima> is rot13 a meme at this point? it keeps coming up and i don't know why
[17:43:23] <cb> again this is 100% bait
[17:43:28] <riv> yes
[17:43:31] <gwozniak> yup
[17:43:40] <gerikson> it is on topic though
[17:43:43] <gerikson> barely
[17:45:40] <dimadima> i dont know much if anything about ESR but this pic gives me good vibes https://usesthis.com/images/interviews/eric.s.raymond/portrait.jpg
[17:45:45] <cb> what's spicier to me is "i switched from linux to mac" because 1. that's something people actually did bitd 2. doing it now is actually brave because you're going against the grain of the HN hivemind
[17:46:08] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: don’t, and i can’t stress this enough, read his blog
[17:46:10] <ngoldbaum> it is Bad
[17:46:13] <edk> is switching from linux to mac anti-hivemind?
[17:46:37] <riv> i dont think so
[17:46:41] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: anything about it you can/care to articulate? but don't worry, i won't
[17:46:50] <riv> oh HN hivemind, i have no idea
[17:46:54] <edk> everyone is switching from linux to mac these days though
[17:46:56] <dimadima> i'd switch from mac if there was any other laptop with an HDPI display
[17:47:00] <cb> it's a mor einteresting twist on the "yes, i went from a veyr user friendly system to having to fight wayland :)"
[17:47:09] <cb> dimadima: i think windows handles hidpi pretty well nowadays
[17:47:14] <cb> linux is still a crapshoot
[17:47:17] <edk> you only have to fight wayland if you choose to use wayland
[17:47:24] <cb> yeah and this guy did

[17:47:34] <ngoldbaum> i guess you can’t
[17:47:41] <cb> ngoldbaum: he got wordpressed
[17:47:48] <cb> rite of passage
[17:47:51] <prussian> click bait works... simple as that.
[17:48:08] <dimadima> i've not been in the laptop market for a long time, but i've never seen another manufacturer that had "retina" displays
[17:48:18] <dimadima> hopefully that's not true anymore
[17:48:23] <dimadima> wordpress sucks god
[17:48:35] <edk> dell makes lots of laptops with higher-than-retina dpi
[17:48:38] <ngoldbaum> apple owns the trademark
[17:48:48] <dimadima> it's fine if you're a content organization etc, but why would a person like ESR use wordpress
[17:48:48] <cb> thinkpads do too but i have my own beefs w.
[17:48:52] <ngoldbaum> other manufacturers call them high DPI displays
[17:48:54] <dimadima> edk: that is great to hear
[17:49:16] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: yeah that's why i was using the term "HDPI" but it maybe caused some confusion
[17:49:20] <dimadima> so i said "retina" to be clear
[17:49:21] <edk> i think they even sell some of them with ubuntu
[17:49:28] <dimadima> edk: well that is pretty good news!
[17:49:35] <dimadima> i will check it out next time i'm looking
[17:49:38] <prussian> one Retina™ Pro™ HDR™ Maxx™ Display for me, please.
[17:49:42] <dimadima> only thing keeping me on mac is the displays
[17:49:43] <ngoldbaum> my last dell xps did
[17:49:48] <ngoldbaum> in 2019
[17:50:02] <ngoldbaum> linux mostly handles it ok
[17:50:14] <dimadima> i'd love a linux laptop
[17:50:14] <buttsbot> Linux distributions are just zodiac signs for nerds.
[17:50:15] <edk> the problem with the not-a-macbook-but-really-a-macbook XPSs is they have all the same thermal issues actual macbooks have
[17:50:18] <edk> well, had, pre-M1
[17:50:37] <ngoldbaum> i’ve never had thermal problems
[17:50:37] <dimadima> buttsbot comes in with some prescient shit sometimes
[17:50:43] <ngoldbaum> have had plenty of linux issues

[17:51:29] <ngoldbaum> mine are mostly thunderbolt related
[17:51:30] <dimadima> thing is dell doesn't align with my mindset much more than apple, if at all :(
[17:51:46] <dimadima> fuck dell, really
[17:51:49] <ngoldbaum> i tried to use a thunderbolt3 dock and it mostly worked but it did introduce stability problems
[17:52:02] <cb> i don't have any tb3 stuff
[17:52:07] <cb> it seems kinda quirky tho
[17:52:12] <dimadima> yeah i was wondering, what's your thunderbold stuff?
[17:52:29] <ngoldbaum> i guess intel didn’t add enough error correction to the protocol or whatever
[17:52:31] <cb> esp when i just have a desktop if i wanna play gamers
[17:52:36] <gwozniak> The tb3 dock works great on my MBPro. It's generally good on my ThinkPad
[17:52:40] <edk> i don't think dell is a better company than apple but they're smaller and therefore less evil from first principles
[17:52:45] <ngoldbaum> it’s nice to be qble
[17:52:54] <edk> i also just don't like macos at all
[17:52:59] <ngoldbaum> to plug in one cable and have your work setup ready to go
[17:54:11] <dimadima> edk: that makes sense yes
[17:54:33] <prussian> only thing I ever used Thunderbolt for was literally a "dock"
[17:54:37] <dimadima> i like to think which company contributes least to net human misery?
[17:54:45] <prussian> as was mentioned. the single cable to rule them all sort of zany

[19:57:16] <manicennui> I'm just now realizing that the Japanese eat a lot of eggs.
[19:57:35] <manicennui> Probably because we focus on things like sushi in the US.
[19:58:17] <manicennui> "Japan consumes more eggs than anywhere else in the world. On average, a Japanese individual eats 320 eggs annually."
[19:58:26] <bkero> That is a decent page
[19:58:39] <bkero> Eat you some eggs.
[19:58:51] <bkero> I just got a tamagoyaki pan, brought it up. My partner's used it twice in one day. Good stuff.
[19:59:59] <manicennui> I noticed that they eat egg salad sandwiches in a lot of anime. I wonder whether their egg salad is better than what is commonly available in the US.
[20:02:03] <manicennui> "Japanese mayonnaise has a rich egg flavor because only egg yolks are used compared to the American mayo that contains the entire egg.  Also, Japanese mayo is typically made with rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar, instead of distilled vinegar."
[20:02:04] <manicennui> Hmm.
[20:02:30] <manicennui> And MSG apparently.
[20:02:32] <manicennui> Cheaters.
[20:11:56] <bkero> Mmm kewpie
[20:12:08] <bkero> I'd say the sugar in kewpie makes more of a flavor difference than the msg
[20:14:42] <manicennui> I tend to like things with a bit of sweetness. Kewpie might be dangerous for me.

[22:23:36] <manicennui> They are almost completely irrelevant for browsers, and their OS is losing market share, and more people are willing to use something other than Office, but they are slowly gaining a lot of other companies.

[23:00:54] <manicennui> Things like Hypercard.
[23:01:37] <gerikson> I think most developers pointed and laughed at hypercard
[23:01:52] <gerikson> which in any case didn't survive the move to Next-inspired OS?
[23:03:07] <manicennui> I'm not entirely sure what MS did "better".
[23:03:41] <manicennui> I went through that entire period, and they certainly had far more resources than competitors for development tools.
[23:03:43] <bkero> Embrance and extend
[23:03:46] <bkero> versus NIH everything
[23:03:49] <manicennui> But a lot of what they did was fucking terrible.
[23:04:02] <manicennui> And they held web development back for half a decade.
[23:04:50] <gerikson> MS was like "you want to make money using our OS and tools, we want to help you with that"
[23:05:02] <manicennui> gerikson: How did they do that?
[23:05:06] <manicennui> And how did Apple prevent it?
[23:05:24] <gerikson> didn't say Apple prevented it, just that they didn't have the same focus on developers than MSFT
[23:05:31] <gerikson> but I might be taling out of my ass
[23:05:45] <manicennui> It's a common sentiment. I just don't know what people think they actually did.
[23:06:01] <manicennui> I mean, was reinventing OLE 15 times a good thing?
[23:06:08] <gerikson> lol no
[23:06:17] <gerikson> silverlight!
[23:06:47] <gwozniak> It would not surprise me if we got 15 versions of something like OLE from any tech company focussed on devs
[23:06:49] <manicennui> There were a lot of development tools available in the late 90s, but MS was far bigger in the corporate world.
[23:07:09] <manicennui> And Apple was struggling at that point.
[23:07:10] <gerikson> yep
[23:07:34] <manicennui> MS still charged for their development tools at that point too.
[23:07:43] <manicennui> And many like Borland's tools more.
[23:07:44] <gerikson> the few apple devs I folow complain about lacking docs and generally lacking resources from apple itself for some features
[23:08:37] <manicennui> MSDN has always been pretty decent, but before the Internet really took off, I don't know that you could get it without paying.
[23:08:49] <gerikson> afaik apple's dev stuff wasn't free either

[23:09:26] <manicennui> I honestly think the fact that Windows ran on cheap shitty hardware was a far bigger factor.
[23:10:08] <gerikson> yeah, certainly an important factor
[23:10:42] <manicennui> The Apple clone phase was a mess.
[23:11:13] <manicennui> They were basically just worse machines, and only slightly cheaper.
[23:11:31] <gwozniak> At the startup I worked at back in 2012 we deployed on Mac hardware and built an iPad app.  Apple wasn't the devs favourite partner
[23:12:48] <gwozniak> The CEO was a huge fan, though
[23:13:33] <gwozniak> Deploying on Macs kind of sucks
[23:13:42] <manicennui> I don't know. It kind of seemed like MS might have been accessible, but unless you were huge, they weren't going to fix a bug just for you.
[23:13:57] <manicennui> Half of MSDN was documentation of fucked up shit their software did, with a note that it was "by design".
[23:14:01] <manicennui> And no plans to change it.
[23:14:41] <manicennui> gwozniak: My employer uses some third-party software to do it, which is common on Windows too.

[23:15:30] <manicennui> I'm sure there are more options for Windows.
[23:15:32] <gwozniak> For Mac servers, too?
[23:15:39] <manicennui> Not sure.
[23:15:43] <manicennui> We don't have any Mac servers.
[23:15:50] <manicennui> Don't think they are sold at all anymore.
[23:15:57] <gwozniak> We were using Mac servers
[23:16:19] <gwozniak> And no, they aren't made anymore.  They weren't made in 2012 either
[23:16:39] <gwozniak> We had a few Mac Minis
[23:16:51] <gwozniak> It was a gong show
[23:16:58] <manicennui> I don't want to deal with Mac nor Windows servers.
[23:17:11] <manicennui> And can't imagine what reason there would be to use them at this point.
[23:17:34] <gwozniak> CEO loves Apple.  That was our reason.
[23:17:49] <gwozniak> Also why I left

[23:18:36] <indigo> A Dell or HP server would have done better for cheaper, but no, not as shiny
[23:18:59] <gwozniak> Our CEO went out and bought two of them. One of them was used for his son to setup a Minecraft server, which killed our bandwidth one weekend
[23:19:19] <gwozniak> We just unplugged it
[23:19:24] <indigo> That's some CEO-level vision right there
[23:19:29] <gwozniak> Since we didn't have the login
