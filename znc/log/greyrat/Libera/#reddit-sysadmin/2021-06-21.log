[08:06:55] <riff-IRC> and that was on a 50A/208V breaker, so something had to have had a serious failure

[08:08:50] <A-KO> what is up?
[08:08:52] <A-KO> what's up xe0n
[08:08:54] <riff-IRC> load was shared across 4 IGBTs. One of them totally detonated, which caused the UPS to suddenly put itself back on line power WITH THE INVERTER STILL ENERGIZED
[08:08:54] <A-KO> all
[08:10:25] <riff-IRC> both are wildly out of sync with one another, AC line backfeeds inverter w/ a roughly ~300V potential, massive fault occurs which trips the 50A 208V breaker again, UPS starts throwing hot metal and silicon everywhere, making it unsafe to approach
[08:11:48] <Jay-Ros> geeze, are you copy-pasting from the incident report?
[08:12:10] <Jay-Ros> "shit's fucked, and old."
[08:13:12] <riff-IRC> so it spends 30 seconds just going batcrap insane, welding relays and in general setting fire to itself before the transformer hard shorted, took out the remaining IGBTs, and cremated the 200A battery fuse, shutting it down for good

[08:15:36] <riff-IRC> had to *R*U*N* and throw the Halon 1301 override switch before it went off
[08:16:14] <riff-IRC> Everything attached to it recorded some brutal power events or got totally smoked.
[08:16:55] <riff-IRC> The system responsible for monitoring it got totally killed with ~400V straight down the serial port
[08:18:33] <riff-IRC> at least 2 high-level execs came out along with a team of engineers from APC to do a postmortem on it
[08:19:33] <riff-IRC> they rootcaused it to high moisture in the IGBTs caused by improper encasing conditions at the end of the manufacturing process
[08:20:24] <riff-IRC> which resulted in the casing material turning conductive and arcing over, which is deadly to an IGBT at 125A of load.
[08:21:45] <riff-IRC> that in turn destroyed the controlling logic in the inverter, which caused the other 3 IGBTs to effectively freerun unsync'd and drift against each other
[08:22:43] <riff-IRC> also, the main microprocessor latched up, causing it to go onto AC power with the inverter running, which just added more fuel to an already nasty situation
[08:24:01] <riff-IRC> everything drifted enough to go 180deg out of phase with utility, causing it to hit that transformer with ~400V for several cycles, saturating it and throwing the 50A breaker
[08:24:46] <Jay-Ros> that's why I manually solder an additional 19A breaker bump onto it
[08:24:53] <Jay-Ros> !quote 69

[08:25:30] <riff-IRC> then it was the 3 IGBTs freewheeling against each other for 30 seconds, destroying themselves and feeding the LV side of the main transformer with way out of tolerance voltages and frequencies
[08:26:10] <riff-IRC> then the LV winding melted down and hard shorted, which detonated the IGBTs and cremated the 200A battery fuse, putting it to rest for good
[08:28:00] <riff-IRC> we lost around $130K of equipment because it got spiked with 400V for several AC cycles
[08:28:58] <riff-IRC> not only did APC replace the fallen UPS, they also paid to replace all the fallen equipment- and let us keep the old UPS for our "room of shame"
[08:29:26] <estranger> oof
[08:29:38] <riff-IRC> yea
[08:30:17] <riff-IRC> we actually took pictures of it and sent them to the manufacturer of the faulty IGBT

[12:13:41] <Cl0udNinja> csws, I used to do that in the summer. go chill in the dc and do some cable management/labeling, or check all of the servers for audible/visual alerts
[12:14:12] <csws> I should go check on the little torch charger thingy
[12:14:13] <Cl0udNinja> I'm wooooorkin on itttt :P I had to do some rejiggering on the power management
[12:14:31] <xe0n> ok good
[12:14:33] <csws> testing some torches and one has already failed pretty hard

[12:15:03] <csws> the vesda guy said we couldn't use real torches
[12:15:07] <xe0n> s/flashlights/fleshlights
[12:15:08] <layer8> Cl0udNinja meant: "csws, you mean fleshlights right?"
[12:15:11] <csws> and the boss said we can't use fleshlights
[12:15:12] <csws> dammit
[12:15:23] <Cl0udNinja> man, this little light I got for camping is amazing
[12:15:38] <Cl0udNinja> the max brightness setting is enough to burn your hand
[12:15:44] <csws> nice
[12:16:01] <csws> one of my torches at home gets very warm to the touch on full brightness
[12:16:05] <csws> it's just over 1000 lumens
[12:16:08] <Cl0udNinja> its like, 2 inches tall, got a pocket clip too, lasts for a good while
