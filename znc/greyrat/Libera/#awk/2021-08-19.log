[17:07:40] <Helmholtz1> `awk '{gsub("newest", "✓", $4)} 1'`
[17:08:10] <Helmholtz1> Is this the correct way of replacing all "newest" strings in 4th column of stdin with ✓ ?
[17:08:27] <Helmholtz1> columns are space-separated
[17:10:22] <seninha> Helmholtz1: yes, but be aware that the spaces between fields will be reduced to a single space
[17:10:37] <seninha> # echo "a    b      c       newest" | awk '{gsub("newest", "✓", $4)} 1'
[17:10:38] <shbot> seninha: a b c ✓
[17:10:45] <Helmholtz1> seninha, any ways to preserve it?
[17:16:49] <earnestly> in awk -F ' ' is special.  To use literal spaces you have to use -F '[ ]'
[17:17:01] <earnestly> Iow, a regex, to bypass the code path that gives special meaning to ' '
[17:17:47] <earnestly> A more useful question might be to consider why preserving whitespace is important
[17:18:32] <seninha> # echo "a    b    c     newest" | sed -E 's/([ \t]*[^ \t]+[ \t]+[^ \t]+[ \t]+[^ \t]+[ \t]+)newest(.*)/\1✓\2/'
[17:18:33] <shbot> seninha: a    b    c     ✓
[17:18:52] <Helmholtz1> seninha, earnestly thanks
[17:18:57] <Helmholtz1> I try changing it via jq
[17:19:13] <earnestly> # echo 'a    b      c       newest' | awk -F '[ ]' '{NF="✓"; print}
[17:19:19] <earnestly> # echo 'a    b      c       newest' | awk -F '[ ]' '{$NF="✓"; print}
[17:19:20] <shbot> earnestly: Missing terminating quote, bracket or keyword
[17:19:26] <shbot> earnestly: Missing terminating quote, bracket or keyword
[17:19:29] <earnestly> # echo 'a    b      c       newest' | awk -F '[ ]' '{$NF="✓"; print}'
[17:19:30] <shbot> earnestly: a    b      c       ✓
[17:19:32] <earnestly> There we go
[17:19:43] <earnestly> Helmholtz1: Wait, why is jq involved now?
[17:19:55] <earnestly> And more importantly, why is awk getting involved if you already have jq?
[17:20:08] <earnestly> Heh, jq | awk is the new grep | awk
[17:20:27] <Helmholtz1> yeah I should have used jq as much as possible
[17:20:43] <earnestly> Possibly, it may be necessary to get awk involved
[17:20:54] <seninha> earnestly: in this case initial space will create a new field, wont't it?
[17:20:59] <seninha> # echo '     a    b      c       newest' | awk -F '[ ]' '{$NF="✓"; print}
[17:21:06] <shbot> seninha: Missing terminating quote, bracket or keyword
[17:21:11] <seninha> # echo '     a    b      c       newest' | awk -F '[ ]' '{$NF="✓"; print}'
[17:21:12] <shbot> seninha:      a    b      c       ✓
[17:21:25] <seninha> # echo '     a    b      c       newest' | awk -F '[ ]' '{$4="✓"; print}'
[17:21:26] <shbot> seninha:    ✓  a    b      c       newest
[17:21:39] <earnestly> This is why I used $NF, yeah
[17:22:16] <earnestly> # echo 'a    b      c       newest' | awk -F '[ ]' '$NF == "newest" {$NF="✓"; print}' # if checks are needed
[17:22:17] <shbot> earnestly: a    b      c       ✓
[17:22:46] <earnestly> Or a for loop if newest can appear anywhere
