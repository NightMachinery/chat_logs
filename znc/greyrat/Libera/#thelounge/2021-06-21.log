[09:52:04] <lzap1> guys I had unstable connection over the weekend and the client kept reconnecting for some time and it got me banned on few channels 
[09:52:12] <lzap1> how do I limit amount of reconnections?

[09:57:06] <bookworm> you can't really, TL resets the reconnection count once you successfully reconnected
[09:57:49] <bookworm> which is fairly common btw
[09:58:50] <bookworm> (well, irc-framework but whatever...)
[10:03:11] <lzap1> yeah I see it in the codebase, well, fedora-devel banned me after 22th try
[10:03:30] <bookworm> makes sense
[10:03:50] <bookworm> that's usually a temporary redirect ban, so just wait a bit
[10:04:09] <bookworm> not sure how fedora does it, that's how we handle it
[10:04:11] <lzap1> oh I started poking at fedora-admin, okay so you say just waiting
[10:04:29] <bookworm> if you can ping ops that's easiest
[10:05:53] <lzap1> thanks for help, appreciated
[10:06:20] <bookworm> sure. But if your home network is that bad rent a vps somewhere ;)
[10:06:27] <lzap1> what a weird saturday, something on the way was killing connections
[10:06:31] <lzap1> probably too hot here :-)
[10:06:40] <lzap1> nope my net is extremely good
[10:06:49] <lzap1> this was really weird, never happened to me
[10:07:02] <bookworm> yeah well, Murphy
