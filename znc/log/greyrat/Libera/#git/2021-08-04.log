[03:04:33] <nesmysl> osse: regarding my usecase for git clone --bare --origin=...: i tend to avoid that name as it carries very little information.  like when i clone a repo from github, it might be my "fork" of a 3rd-party repo, it might be the 3rd party itself.  "upstream" is meaningful to me, as are my initials in its place if i cloned mine.  "origin" is meaningless.

[08:30:48] <snappy> q: i'm helping someone who has two ssh keys (id_ed25519 and id_rsa). We had to use GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa" git clone ssh://... to select the right key (there's no ssh-agent running or anything). But I find subsequent operations on the repo like git push/pull/etc. works, does it somehow remember which ssh identity is being used and is that stored somewhere?

[14:46:53] <torarne> Q: I'd like to sync a bunch of directories between two machines, including ones with git repos inside. From what I've understood that's a BadIdeaTM, even if the sync happens without conflicts, because the objects and other git internal files may be fs specific (?). And then there's of course the problem of possible conflicts in internal files. Is my understanding somewhat correct? :)

[14:59:11] <torarne> osse: in any case, the warnings I've seen against putting .git into dropbox and other sync tools is that file level conflicts can easily mess up a repo. I assume that's a likely scenario ?

[15:00:15] *** Joins: w0ng (~w0ng@185.218.127.38)

[15:11:51] <roxlu> hey osse wow, did you just create that?
[15:12:00] <osse> heh no
[15:12:19] <roxlu> oh ok :)
[15:12:38] <osse> i have a bunch of those "drawings" in a directory
[15:12:49] <osse> sometimes I modify one. In this case I didn't
[15:14:51] <roxlu> I see. I'm trying to get a better understanding of why I'm getting those conflicts and I think the situation is a bit different than in that post (but not 100% sure)
[15:15:53] <roxlu> So at some point they created a branch, let's call it: "super" from upstream/something. Then in 2020, they did a merge with "upstream/release/4.3"
[15:16:45] <roxlu> now, I'm trying to do a "rebase upstream/release/4.4" and I'm getting merge conflicts about changes which were already fixed when they merged release/3.3
[15:17:53] <osse> the point of that graph is that when you do 'git rebase foo' git will rebase ALL commits in the chain foo..HEAD
[15:18:23] <osse> but if the current branch was started as an off-shoot form an off-shoot of a branch then you end up rebase a lot more than intended (I assume)
[15:21:31] <roxlu> ah I see what you mean and that makes sense, though in this situation I only have a branchA
[15:21:58] <roxlu> ... or I think so at least
[15:22:43] <osse> from what branch did you create yours?
[15:23:19] <osse> git log --graph --oneline --decorate branchA upstream/release/4.3 upstream/release/4.4
[15:23:48] <osse> or: git log upstream/release/4.4..HEAD
[15:24:09] <osse> that's the log of the commits to be rebased (without --onto)
[15:25:26] <roxlu> osse: thanks, the branch that I'm trying to rebase was created from the master branch
[15:25:46] <osse> ok, so master is in play

[15:36:36] <osse> mean you want to put super on top of 4.4 right?
[15:36:41] <roxlu> yes
[15:36:51] <osse> was super merged into 4.3 or the other way?
[15:37:38] <roxlu> other way: git checkout origin/super && git merge upstream/release/4.3

[16:11:07] <DarkSeid_> Hi, I'm having an issue where just rebasing is causing me to get into a detached HEAD state, & I have no idea why. I've tried googling, to no avail. I'm wondering what could cause something like this to happen? The rebase doesn't show any conflicts that need resolving, it just finishes and puts me in a detached head state

[16:40:08] <roxlu> ok, osse I created an image to get a better understanding. I've uploaded them here: https://imgur.com/a/hAvjIL6
[16:40:45] <roxlu> in image 1, you see that the `fa` branch merged with `fb`; it resolved all conflicts etc.
[16:41:03] <roxlu> now, what I'm doing is rebasing branch `fa` onto `fc`
[16:41:53] <roxlu> and I would expect that I have to resolve merge conflicts from fc1/fc2, but not fromn fb1/fb2
[16:42:24] <roxlu> or is my understanding incorrect?
[16:43:16] <osse> roxlu: you write "git rebase c". What is c?
[16:43:40] <roxlu> that's the branch with the fc1 and fc2 commits
[16:43:51] <osse> and what is checked out when you run that command?
[16:44:21] <roxlu> that's run from the "a" branch with "fa1/fa2" and the merge with the "b" branch
[16:44:50] <osse> in that case I expect the same as you
[16:44:56] <roxlu> ok great :)
[16:45:33] <roxlu> then there must be something else going on :)
[16:45:48] <roxlu> but at least it's good to know that my understanding about this part is corect.
[16:45:51] <roxlu> *correct

[19:04:49] <ash_worksi> can I still add it? like using some rebase magic?
[19:07:05] <Gurkenglas> osse, git blame on the working tree that git merge gives you to fix commits works fine - an evil way to do what i mean is to make a temporary branch, do git merge, get the "resolve conflicts then commit" error, then delete all file contents that aren't part of a conflict
[19:07:16] <Gurkenglas> then run git blame on the result
[19:07:29] <Gurkenglas> and i want to know the proper way to get such a file
[19:07:36] <imMute> ash_worksi: stage the stuff you want to add (liek you're going to amend).  then run   git commit --fixup $SHA_TO_ADD_TO    then run   git rebase --autosquash $SHA_TO_ADD_TO^   (add the carat to the sha)
[19:08:00] <Gurkenglas> s/fix commits/fix conflicts/
[19:08:03] <imMute> ash_worksi: that will rebase but move the fixup commit to just after the one you want to modify and then will "squash" the two together (but ignore the 2nd's commit message).
[19:08:13] <imMute> ash_worksi: you can add --interactive to the rebase command to see what it's going to do
[19:10:05] <imMute> ash_worksi: there is also 'git commit --squash' which is similar to --fixup, but instead ot causes the rebase to mark the new commit as "squash", which is like fixup but uses both commit messages (and drops you into an editor to reword it if you want)

[20:13:33] <ToAruShiroiNeko> No, just recently started but removing that directory sped things up.
[20:13:35] <imMute> that could just be when the .exe was compiled, and not when that specific copy of it was created
[20:13:36] <ToAruShiroiNeko> To near instant.
[20:14:06] <Gurkenglas> imMute, aw, so the sort of forensic investigation i was hoping for is not a thing?
[20:14:33] <imMute> Gurkenglas: I think windows keeps two separate timestamps (like *nix does) but I don't know for sure
[20:16:04] <imMute> ah, if you go into the Properties dialog, there's 3 timestamps: Created, Modified, Accessed. I think Modified would be when the exe was created while Created is when that specific copy was created.

[20:16:54] <Gurkenglas> sounds good. ToAruShiroiNeko, when you rightclick on a column name in the Windows Explorer's Details view and select Date Created, what does it say on that gitleaks.exe?
[20:17:50] <ToAruShiroiNeko> Created 20 July 2021, Modified 15 may 2020
[20:18:03] <ikke> Wow, a time paradox
[20:18:20] <imMute> not really
[20:18:25] <Gurkenglas> Was 20 july 2021 the recent start?
[20:18:31] <Gurkenglas> of the problem
[20:19:02] <imMute> when copying, Modified stays the same as the source file, while Created is set to when the copy is created.
[20:19:24] <imMute> so pretty much *all* copies of files will be like that (Modified earlier than Created)
[20:19:26] <Gurkenglas> imMute, copying and pasting a file sets date created but not date modified as you say, but my machine has some files here whose Date Created is older than my machine.
[20:20:02] <imMute> Gurkenglas: idk about that.  are they OS files though?
