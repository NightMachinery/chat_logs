[05:38:48] <zacque> Hi, I'm new to Elisp. How can I change the "view" of a text without changing the buffer content?
[05:38:52] <dale> Dumbstruck, yes, indeed.  Particularly when clangd takes me to some useless forward declaration no matter how hard I press M-., but dumb-jump-go gets me to the right place.
[05:38:52] <zacque> E.g. I want "{{holder}} is great!" to be displayed as "Emacs is great".
[05:39:23] <dale> That's overlays, right?
[05:39:57] <zacque> Ah, foolish me, I'm looking at text properties
[05:40:05] <zacque> Let me dig into overlays
[05:40:30] <dale> zacque: I think the problem with text properties might be that they would require you to modify the buffer.  You can mark a bit of text as invisible with text properties but I don't know that you can replace it...

[06:11:13] <Catie> My understanding is that prior to vi, you had line-oriented editors that were designed to be used with hardcopy terminals. The advent of editors that could use an entire screen, "visual editors" or "screen editors" came later, and it was important to distinguish between the two

[06:49:29] <bpalmer> indeed. Perhaps use (sit-for 0) to give other events a chance to be handled
[06:49:50] <bpalmer> insert obligatory mention that there are threads but nothing uses them an d they may not be safe.
[06:52:03] <johnjaye> i'm confused, aren't timers supposed to be handled asynchronously
[06:52:09] <johnjaye> if i'm using the term right
[06:52:15] <johnjaye> so the timer should fire and set s to 1
[06:53:17] <bpalmer> it can't be fired if emacs is busy doing something else.
[06:53:24] <johnjaye> eh
[06:53:45] <bpalmer> a tight loop gives emacs no chance to do anything else, given emacs's usual concurrency paradigm.
[06:54:45] <johnjaye> ah.
[06:55:05] <johnjaye> it says here sit for takes a value in seconds though

[07:16:54] <bpalmer> The basic approch you might do is something that saves occasionally, based on after-change-functions, and then maybe starts compilation with a memory.
[07:16:54] <johnjaye> assuming text properties are valid in the modeline.

[08:39:11] <zebrag> It's supposed to be fixed. Well, I think it isn't
[08:39:22] <dale> bpalmer: Doesn't look to me like there's syntax for that.  You can do "the windows of FRAME" but if you do "for w being the windows of t" it just tries to start with (setq w (frame-selected-window t)) (where the t there is your t).

After restarting emacs, I see inferior-R-args is set correctly, but the R slave process still isn't using --no-restore. I am guessing run-ess-r was created with an empty inferior-R-args as a closure and I ended up setting that variable AFTER the closure is created. What should I do?

[18:24:34] <gnoo> oh yeah, that looks like it

[18:35:03] <xavi> Any idea what the problem with the mouse is?
[18:35:12] <Desk> That's a pretty odd interaction with the mouse though
[18:36:20] <Desk> xavi: The problem seems to be that when clicking with the mouse, the variable that decides whether it should do a rectangle or normal selection always decides to do a normal selection, and disables rectangle selection if it was on.
[18:37:11] <xavi> Any idea what I would need to do to fix that interaction? Or where to start looking?
[18:38:17] <Desk> No clue, am trying to find out too.

[19:45:58] <catern> with X forwarding I can use buttons and things

[19:46:49] <johnjaye> i tried forwarding x11 to my android tablet
[19:46:53] <johnjaye> it was surprisingly usable with emacs
[19:47:08] <Diablo-D3> you can pry tmux out of my cold dead hands
[19:47:16] <catern> yeah emacs, being an old application, is very good with X forwarding
[19:47:46] <catern> (more recent things often have terrible performance with X forwarding because they do lots of intensive stuff, but emacs does not :) )

[19:48:11] <catern> johnjaye: was that just a one-off thing? you don't do it regularly?
[19:48:13] <Diablo-D3> it does nothing that I cant do in console

[21:22:42] <zebrag> Yeah, that
[21:23:32] <zebrag> but that doesn't seem so difficult to implement by thyself? and I don't quite understand the minimap code
[21:24:07] <zebrag> and minimap fails in a variety of situations
[21:24:56] <wgreenhouse> emacs's window management is pretty fragile (even though it's better than most GUIs). multi-window UIs like this will generally fail in a variety of situations.
[21:25:23] <zebrag> hehe
