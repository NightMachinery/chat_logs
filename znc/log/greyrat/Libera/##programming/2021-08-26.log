[01:54:22] <poww0wmus1c> I think Zig's way of handling errors (not sure if it has a particular name) is mostly better than exceptions. It has the benefit that you can defer the error handling as far up the call stack as you want, while at the same time forcing you to consider the case in which a function returns an error.

[02:12:54] <piou> Izem: my first instinct would be that each element would have two sizes as metadata. The current element size, and the slot size. For example say we have two bigs objects taking 4 bytes: BBBB|BBBB. Then we replace the first element by a small object of 1 byte. Having a separate variable slot size would allow you to limit array resizing in a manner similar to memory allocator pools:    S...|BBBB
[02:13:50] <piou> Without indirection and guarantee about object size such resizing are bound to be the main issue performance-wise (I think, profile, always profile)

[03:37:49] <InPhase> spynxic: I don't use either, but from what I gather from others describing and things I've read, Wordpress is fairly limited in flexibility, but Drupal is fairly sophisticated and has a powerful API allowing programmers to make good use of it.
[03:38:16] <Joanna> safeAI_: I wish there was a way to change that
[03:38:24] <a_train[m]> Joanna: if you're unhappy with how other people chose to communicate with each other on their own terms, I could recommend a few bad channels on this network as well as suggest you to start a channel where you can micromanage peoples chatting to your own preferences so that others may be around please you
[03:38:49] <spynxic> It'd be nice to learn that the templates can be written up in a text editor and deployed without much use of the WordPress or whatever's web interface
[03:39:10] <InPhase> spynxic: whitehouse.gov for example used Drupal throughout the Obama administration.  Clearly they could afford a proper website staff.

[04:28:39] <spynxic> edgar-rft: had to make the tables though
[04:29:34] <droid3> ya but lookup tables need interpolation algorithms and cordic was used alot of times
[04:30:59] <droid3> Read the article its a neat way of computing transcendental functions using rotation matrices and powers of 1/2^k with a small precomputed table for the arctangent values corrosponding to the 1/2^k
[04:31:53] <droid3> the reason for this is because the rotation matrix will be all powers of two so you dont need multiplication of numbers other then powers of 2
[04:32:03] <CoJaBo> Well that sucked. Another spambot attack took up half my entire daty :/

[04:35:47] <CoJaBo> Apparently, my ingest script cannot keep up with realtime, so back to the drawing board D=
[04:36:22] <droid3> edgar you can make cordic very precise by just using larger  2^k values and a large precomputed table that is more precise for arctangent of these 2^k values.

[07:08:14] <InPhase> pulse: I don't think it was ever very different from that.  The number of IRC users is technically down a bit from its peak, but not hugely down.  The only thing different is that there are huge numbers of other modalities of interactive communication now, so IRC makes up a much smaller fraction of Internet communication, even though its total activity has remained fairly similar for many decades.
[07:08:42] <InPhase> pulse: In terms of fraction of the planet on IRC, it hasn't changed too much.  :)
[07:09:35] <pulse> idk, i remember ircnet was very popular in early 2000s
[07:10:11] <pulse> people were basically divided between irc, icq, and msn
[07:10:20] <pulse> with a lot of overlap between the three
[07:10:29] <pulse> pretty sure there was a lot more people on irc back then
[07:10:37] <pulse> but of course there was also a lot fewer actual internet users
[07:10:51] <webNET4> i think everquest was pretty much irc with graphical MUD
[07:11:00] <pulse> all early MMOs were like that
[07:11:44] <computerquip> I don't think I ever considered msn to be in competition with irc. 
[07:12:07] <computerquip> Imagine UT2004 integrating MSN messenger instead of IRC lol
[07:13:18] <pulse> msn was huge
[07:13:18] <X-Scale> all those emoticons made msn messenger so childish
[07:13:21] <pulse> bigger than icq easily
[07:13:35] <pulse> probably bigger than irc at peak too, hard to tell
[07:13:55] <computerquip> I think MSN was more popular with the masses yeah
[07:13:58] <beaky> so after a shower and a few cups of tea i think im ready to finally begin thinking about the 'sort a stream of 1 million unsigned 32-bit integers in under 2 MiB of memory total (for the algorithm code, working storage, and output)'
[07:14:16] <computerquip> Everyone I knew had MSN messenger, nobody I knew knew what IRC or ICQ was
[07:14:17] <beaky> i will use insertion sort the fastest sorting algorithm
[07:14:34] <Caffeinated> rofl
[07:14:42] <oldlaptop> are you sure it's iconic enough?

[07:16:00] <computerquip> Or maybe I'm missing context and confused.
[07:16:11] <Caffeinated> obsessions...
[07:16:15] <InPhase> beaky: You want to sort 4MB of integers in 2MB?

[07:19:01] <beaky> bubble sort into a delta coded sequence*
[07:19:49] <PlanckWalk> That would still work
[07:20:02] <PlanckWalk> Not very efficient, but will work :)
[07:20:17] <beaky> yes it will be O(n^2) but thats what google's datacenters are for
[07:20:19] <InPhase> beaky: Compression is guaranteed to fail for some inputs.  This is an information theory fundamental.
[07:21:02] <PlanckWalk> InPhase: It will work here.
[07:21:22] <beaky> yes i must first code this up in rust and see how much it will fail for a variety of input distributions (totally random, uniform, reverse order, already sorted, constant, etc)
[07:21:27] <PlanckWalk> The entropy of a million *sorted* 32-bit integers is less than that of unsorted.
[07:21:46] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: Correct, I suppose.
[07:22:00] <beaky> and then ill report back tomorrow because my algorithm is O(n^2)

[10:56:03] <DPA> The problem is, There could be a token "space" that only matches 1 character, or there could even be empty tokens. So one space would use a lot of memory for the token metadata.

[15:04:05] <arahael> But... powershell does have the advantage that it works well on windows, and fairly well everywhere else.
[15:04:52] <xeno> I don't consider windows to be installed if it doesn't have a reasonably complete cygwin, and gvim. Haven't for 20 years or so

[15:06:28] <xeno> arahael: yeah, but does it interface well with the rest? I suspect it does, hence why I need to look into WSL2 
[15:07:02] <arahael> xeno: Well, like the dos subsystem and the windows subsystem, the linux subsystem is there now.

[15:10:20] <vdamewood> Since it's just the same CPU anyway.
[15:10:47] <vdamewood> Though, since most DOS executables were written for real mode, the DOS subsystem only works on 32-bit builds of Windows.

[16:06:38] <vdamewood> "When applied to object-oriented or procedural concepts, it is also known as function overloading or operator overloading." this is definitely operator overloading.
[16:06:39] <[itchyjunk]> vdamewood, that's what i'm saying
[16:06:45] <smallville7123> the default implementation outputs the class.name + "@" + hashCode()

[16:07:35] <[itchyjunk]> idk how it happens but this happens in java
[16:07:44] <[itchyjunk]> so + behaves differently in that special case
[16:07:54] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: That's type conversion. re floats and ints.

[16:35:24] <vdamewood> Actually, things look like they're going pretty well in #java at the moment.
[16:35:44] <vdamewood> mrig: I'm not aware of what the exact difference is, but there's a technical difference.
[16:35:51] <mrig> sure yes there is.
[16:36:01] <beaky> nice i've finally finished compiling rust now i am ready to begin implementing my solution to sort 1 million integers in under half a megabyte of ram
[16:36:04] <mrig> but they essentially are doing the same thing.
[16:36:24] <vdamewood> I'll worry about the difference when it causes an obscure bug in my code that halts a release.

[16:37:04] <vdamewood> beaky: Have you tried bogo sort?
[16:37:46] <beaky> no because bogo sort needs O(n) memory the sorting algorithm must work in under 2 MiB of ram

[17:16:49] <DPA> I disagree with: "the compiler must go back and fourth writing the type specific code for you when a language has generics."
[17:16:49] <DPA> That I call templates. As a generic, I understand things like "struct generic {void* a}; struct specialized {union{struct generic generic; struct{T* a};};};", in other words, objects for which the memory layout remains the same, and can be converted between the generic and specialized version as needed.
[17:16:56] <vdamewood> pyzozord: So, still using SDL and friends?

[17:45:31] <pyzozord> yes language seems to be mostly a matter of preference
[17:45:54] <deniska> in gamedev you typically go with the engine/framework/libraries
[17:46:09] <deniska> unless you are willing what in many cases amounts to reinventing the world
[17:46:09] <sandman13> hence C++ in majority of cases

[17:48:16] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: I have in the past.

[17:49:05] <pyzozord> deniska: I know :)
[17:49:16] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Anyway, my point is, most of those are themselves written in C++.
[17:49:33] <vdamewood> So most devs are kind of forced in C++.
[17:49:53] <pyzozord> vdamewood: I wouldn't agree. Many languages have c/c++ interop
[17:50:00] <deniska> vdamewood: but then you have unity which uses C# as a scripting language, and UE4 which went with "ah, just write some more C++"
[17:50:03] <pyzozord> if you really wanted you could do with something different
[17:50:05] <pikapika> Crysis seems overstated
[17:50:15] <vdamewood> pyzozord: No. Most languages have C interop. C++ is a hairier beast.

[17:50:21] <KillerWasp> i programming games in C/C++, but lately in C++ i find it too frustrating, always causing me problems, it seems that it is not made for large and complicated projects, it turns out to be too closed or limited a language and does not allow me to do great things.

[17:50:56] <Akronymus> Nowadays the goal seems to make games run on min specs on basically anything
[17:51:06] <deniska> Akronymus: I mean, it said the minimum requirements right there on a box
[17:51:07] <pikapika> KillerWasp, are you writing C++ or C with templates and classes
[17:51:10] <vdamewood> In fact, the only language implementation I've used that actually has C++ interop is Node.
[17:51:12] <pyzozord> vdamewood: i'm imagining here, but I guess they could write a C wrapper for the C++ code and interop with the wrapper
[17:51:17] <sandman13> If I am given a task to clean a floor, I wouldn't start with a toothpick.
[17:51:24] <deniska> Akronymus: and a lot of people tried running it on below minimum :)
[17:51:32] <deniska> (I know because I'm one of them)
[17:51:41] <pikapika> vdamewood, and I am guessing thats because node itself is written in C++ and it involves compiling node with your C++ library in order to use it?
[17:51:43] <vdamewood> pyzozord: And in such a performance-driven field, the double function calls would destroy your framerate.

[17:54:08] <pikapika> KillerWasp, today C++ is a very different language

[18:01:54] <KillerWasp> pikapika# What I don't like about C ++ is that it uses as its style to follow, use all pre-made classes and templates in the general C ++ headers, like std, vector, etc. which I find inconvenient because you lose the performance using something that has too many unnecessary things, and you don't really know what its limitations are, you don't even know if it is better to handle it as a pointer or if it is convenient to free its memory 
[18:01:54] <KillerWasp> manually.
[18:01:59] <vdamewood> One of the things I like about CMake is that it can output to any build system I would want to use: make, ninja, MS Build, Xcode.
[18:02:07] <pyzozord> also even crazier that virtual machines are essentially an array and a for loop with a big switch 
[18:02:33] <TJ-> pyzozord: what!?
[18:02:43] <Akronymus> pyzozord not quite a switch.

[18:04:20] <KillerWasp> pikapika# is what I always did, write my own libraries based on the C libraries.

[18:06:25] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: how would that work? No switch and no hashmap?

[18:59:37] <juliaEnv> hey, I have a quick hint to share with fellow sw engineers. I've spent years of learning new knowledge in software by reading about things as found by google. Often, wikipedia, etc. This was wrong and resulted in long-winded, detailed specific knowledge where instead knowlege of high-level concepts and their relationships is required. Of course, I have a procedural knowledge to solve problems in practice. But, wikipedia 
[18:59:37] <juliaEnv> doesn't give a conceptual knowldge to understand concepts and how they relate. Wikipedia only gives some long-winded detailed and unclear stuff that doesn't fit into concepts very well .
[19:00:20] <juliaEnv> so, if you want to learn new knowledge about something before you write the code, look at https://www.slideshare.net for it and preferably read slides that have a Prof. or Dr. as their author

[19:01:12] <hexology> good quality conference talks can be very helpful. but at the end of the day you can't beat a well-written book if you really want to learn something.
[19:02:09] <hexology> there are a handful of very high quality technical blogs, though. those can be very educational. and once in a while you do actually learn something on stackoverflow or the "softwareengineering" stackexchange site
[19:02:13] <juliaEnv> they aren't random (stochastic), they are slides that are the search results for your query (as in information retrieval), so they are the answer to your query
[19:02:33] <juliaEnv> regarding quality, that's why I recommend slides written by a Prof. or Dr. as the author
[19:02:36] <vdamewood> Looks like my development environment scripts need to be updated for Visual Studio 2022.
[19:02:56] <hexology> juliaEnv: there's quite a bit of noise in that data generating process. just because slideshare thinks it's relevant for your query, doesn't mean it's a useful resource.

[20:54:36] <terminalpusher> Hello I got a question about VS Code. If my indentation is 4 spaces and my cursor is like this (the cursor is |): "    |" and I press backspace then VS Code goes like this: "  |" but I actually want it to go directly to the line above, just like how Intellij does it because 4 spaces is my indentation. How can I do this in VS Code?
[20:55:10] <vdamewood> pulse: Same species.
[20:55:28] <pulse> terminalpusher, you want the cursor to go _up_ when you press backspace?
[20:55:57] <vdamewood> pulse: No, terminalpusher wants the indentation of the current line to match the previous line.
[20:56:03] <terminalpusher> not always when I press backspace, only when there's nothing but whitespace before the cursor
[20:56:10] <terminalpusher> like it's the case for "    |"
[20:56:18] <pulse> i've never seen such behavior before
[20:56:21] <pulse> i'm pretty sure

[20:56:29] <terminalpusher> Intellij does it and it's way quicker
[20:56:31] <pulse> backspace goes up if it deletes the entire line usually

[20:56:39] *** Quits: shredder (~user@user/shredder) (Quit: quitting)
[20:56:40] <pulse> never used it
[20:56:46] <terminalpusher> you can navigate much better, most of the time you don't want to remove the whitespaces, you just want to go up
[20:57:05] <terminalpusher> wait actually I misremembered, what it does is it deletes the whole line of whitespace *and* goes up
[20:57:08] <terminalpusher> yeah that's what it does
[20:57:22] <terminalpusher> but in VS Code it's slower because it goes incrementally instead of instant: "    |
[20:57:25] <terminalpusher> wait
[20:57:36] <pulse> shouldn't it just delete contents but not the line
[20:57:38] <pulse> and only then the line
[20:57:39] <terminalpusher> "    |" -> "  |" -> "|" and *then* it goes up
[20:57:49] <terminalpusher> only the whitespace
[20:57:55] <terminalpusher> if there's only whitespace on that line
[20:57:59] <pulse> yeah that seems normal
[20:58:10] <terminalpusher> and go right up. Is there an extension in VS Code for that?
[20:58:10] <pulse> it would weird me out if it just went up
[20:58:15] <pulse> if it skipped the last step*
[20:58:23] <terminalpusher> yeah I forgot to mention it does also delete it
[20:58:29] <pulse> no idea
[20:58:42] <terminalpusher> it's much faster but I don't use intellij as my main so I'd like to have this in VS Code

[21:23:07] <pyzozord> poprocks: apparently language doesn't have enums, but there is library package for it
[21:23:29] <pikapika> poprocks, thinking in C is also a problem for me
[21:23:33] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: It's short for enumeration. An enumeration is a type in some language where you define symbolic name for discrete values.
[21:23:46] <poprocks> I feel like you reach a point where you just know gross code is gross, even if you don't know the underlying language

[21:24:20] <Guest761> lol
[21:24:27] <pikapika> Its meant to denote a bunch of integer constants usually
[21:24:43] <pyzozord> C is really infective. And python has it's own ideas how code should be written. There is even a popular phrase used in the python community "pythonic code"

[21:24:53] <pikapika> And usually in a 1,2,3... series

[21:28:03] <pikapika> For example
[21:28:08] <pikapika> Lets say you are writing a parser
[21:28:09] <poprocks> because the language is very small

[21:33:01] <GeDaMo> Array of pointers to char
[21:33:07] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmmm
[21:33:17] <poprocks> [itchyjunk]: basically yeah - in C an 'array of char' is basically a string. A null-terminated array of char, technically
[21:33:19] <vdamewood> In python if you want a char, you use a string with length of 1.
[21:33:24] <Guest761> hmm bbb just code dude
[21:33:25] <[itchyjunk]> in python, string is primitive?
[21:33:31] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmm interesting 
[21:33:35] <Guest761> too much talking does not do code lol
[21:33:47] <pikapika> All strings are arrays of chars. Its just that your language has it wrapped in a class.
[21:33:59] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: No. Python doesn't have primatives. In Python, everything is a class.
[21:34:07] <poprocks> char string[] = "bar"; is just syntactic sugar for char string[4] = { 'b
[21:34:09] <poprocks> crap
[21:34:10] <vdamewood> err everyting is an object.
[21:34:23] <poprocks> char string[] = "bar"; is just syntactic sugar for char string[4] = { 'b', 'a', 'r', 0 };
[21:34:24] <Guest761> this like programmers porn to talk about code lol

[21:58:58] <pyzozord> ^-^hi: sorry that was for you
[21:59:00] <vdamewood> Well, time to arrange all the complex numbers in order.
[21:59:02] <Guest761> its way more fun than talking xd
[21:59:11] <vdamewood> Guest761: Feel free.
[21:59:12] <Guest761> vdamewood is smart he knows object
[21:59:13] <[itchyjunk]> so  for z,w \in C, z < w is itnerpreted as |z| < |w|
[21:59:25] <[itchyjunk]> i.e vector z is closer to origin than vector w
[21:59:25] <^-^hi> pyzozord, well the lists are in {}
[21:59:36] <pikapika> Oh
[21:59:38] <Guest761> all is object and objects have classes functions methods lol
[21:59:41] <pikapika> The mag can be used yeah
[21:59:42] <Guest761> who are also objects
[21:59:43] <Guest761> :)

[22:00:10] <[itchyjunk]> |x+y| < |x| + |y| yes
[22:00:17] <[itchyjunk]> Cauchy inequality holds
[22:00:33] <[itchyjunk]> because the magnitudes are just reals
[22:00:37] <pikapika> But thats the thing really. How do you define a number? Is a number just any thing that satisfies a field and an ordering?
[22:00:41] <^-^hi> pyzozord, python lists. in C the array literals are {} i think, so more pseudo-c
[22:00:41] <[itchyjunk]> and Cauchy inequality holds for reals
[22:00:51] <[itchyjunk]> "number" isn't that formal
[22:00:56] <Guest761> its all same
[22:01:03] <Guest761> lists, algo go via lists arrays
[22:01:04] <[itchyjunk]> you define "real number" as elements of the set of Reals
[22:01:06] <[itchyjunk]> :P

[22:01:25] <Guest761> due to testosterone
[22:01:29] <pikapika> You defined other classes of "numbers" like quarternions. How does something get classified as a "number"?
[22:01:33] <[itchyjunk]> and the set Reals are equivalently defined in different ways
[22:01:47] <pikapika> I think I have only read the construction as an ordered field
