[01:21:19] <thuna`> Hold on, that's the opposite: t if it kill, nil if it doesn't
[01:22:07] <wasamasa> murphy__: another way of finding it is looking at the definition of `evil-ex-define-cmd`, locating the variable it saves those definitions to and inspecting it
[01:23:03] <wasamasa> murphy__: then you'd find it lands there, but the emacs printer avoids displaying identical objects (instead it replaces them with #digit# references), so just searching for "close" doesn't give you the definition either

[07:38:17] <acdw> twb: yeah i don't think so
[07:38:27] <acdw> idk why it'd be on th emenu but not able to be found
[07:38:31] <twb> corwin: it's actually usually the GNU Manifesto that is invariant
[07:39:13] <twb> corwin: which is basically a one-page thing saying "1990s Sun sucks, let's go back to the Good Old Days of the 1970s when IBM did not stop me stealing code from Symbolics corporation"
[07:39:34] <TRS-80> I think "but nobody is allowed to edit this bit that say RMS is great" is a bit of a mis-characterization.
[07:40:05] <twb> Pro tip: when the MIT AI lab tried to create a for-profit startup, RMS stayed at MIT and just kept copy-pasting code from the for-profit codebase into the free codebase
[07:40:33] <twb> When everyone was like "this is not only rude, but illegal" he instead started reading the API docs and re-implementing the code from that.
[07:40:43] <TRS-80> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-howto-opt.html
[07:40:50] <acdw> well that's one way to do it i guess
[07:40:50] <anticomputer> acdw: that did the trick thanks :)
[07:40:52] <twb> Then everyone was like "look just fuck off, please" and so he switched to Unix cloning
[07:41:01] <acdw> anticomputer :)
[07:41:13] <twb> acdw: anyway
[07:41:20] <twb> acdw: does the .info-1.gz or whatever physically exist?
[07:41:29] <TRS-80> twb: that's not the story I heard, also I don't get all the hate for rms (not just from you, in general)
[07:41:48] <twb> TRS-80: well I am deliberately retelling it with maximum snark
[07:42:58] <TRS-80> story I read was more like he single-handedly kept re-implementing what an entire for-profit company was doing, the latter trying to "Extend" (in a Microsoft sense) what had always been shared freely up to that point in time.
[07:43:20] <TRS-80> like, every night, all night hack sessions, while also still doing $dayjob
[07:43:29] <twb> TRS-80: I don't particularly _hate_ RMS, but I think he's the equivalent of a 2nd wave feminist going on twitter and yelling at 4th wavers that they are class traitors
[07:44:01] <TRS-80> I am not even sure I know what that means, nor do I probably want to
[07:44:59] <acdw> twb: So.  I just checked: I have geiser.texi installed in a directory in Info-directory-list, as well as a file called `dir` and a number of other .texi files
[07:45:01] <ajak> it's also still not the year of gnu/linux on the desktop
[07:45:22] <TRS-80> also, anticomputer, thanks for blazing that trail, I'm in same boat (Ivy) and taking notes ;)
[07:45:39] <twb> TRS-80: ok um... imagine someone bursting into a climate change conference and telling everyone they hate women because they are trying to fix the atmosphere BEFORE fixing suffrage in a country you've never even heard of
[07:46:03] <spikemas`> ido 4 life
[07:46:36] <twb> acdw: yeah when you do C-h i, it is basically viewing /usr/share/info/dir which is BASICALLY a list of the .info files in that folder
[07:47:04] <twb> acdw: so as long as ./dir links to the right filenames, it should Just Work.  Maybe file is not readable (root:root r--------) ?

[07:52:14] <corwin> ideally, you should replace it

[07:52:51] <acdw> hmm
[07:53:04] <acdw> can Info open a *.texi file, or does it need to be compiled?

[07:53:27] <pingpongball> twb right, so i fear compiling gcc to get libgccjit.
[07:53:36] <twb> acdw: .texi is basically .tex and it's compiled into a plain-ish text format .info
[07:53:47] <twb> pingpongball: can you just use a less shit distro
[07:53:49] <acdw> ahh, thus the .texi
[07:54:00] <twb> acdw: .tex is *tex* tho, not late
[07:54:02] <twb> acdw: .tex is *tex* tho, not latex
[07:54:06] <acdw> right
[07:54:22] <acdw> but can Emacs' Info reader read .textinfo files by themselves?
[07:54:31] <acdw> *texi, sorry
[07:54:33] <twb> The only good thing about texi/info is the emacs info browser is still(!) better than a regular web browser
[07:54:38] <acdw> ahaha right
[07:54:43] <twb> acdw: no, you need texi2info
[07:54:43] <acdw> at least for thsoe
[07:54:51] <acdw> oh okay, that must be the issue.
[07:54:51] <pingpongball> twb i wanted to look cool , like void, nothing, it feels superior
[07:55:06] <twb> But yeah the benefit of info browser isn't a big enough difference IMO
[07:55:13] <twb> especially when you consider that texi only supports europeans
[07:55:20] <twb> and not even all europeans
[07:55:31] <acdw> voidlinux is pretty good. pingpongball: just build a gcc --- i mean my gcc is jit'd and it works

[10:13:08] <bpalmer> "a proposed bill now advancing in the New Hampshire legislature deserves renewed scrutiny. It would ban the advocacy of any 'doctrine' or 'theory' promoting a 'negative' account of U.S. history"
[10:13:27] <bpalmer> This will probably make some events a little less comprehensible, but ....
[10:14:37] <twb> isn't New Hampshire one of the top-right bits where rich white people live
[10:15:20] <bpalmer> it's top right, but ... hmm.
[10:15:38] <bpalmer> Apparently it's "one of only 8 [out of 50] states where household income is above the national average."
[10:16:02] <twb> I mentally picture it being full of people who own more than one house
[10:16:18] <twb> and drive cars with like 7 doors -- or perhaps are driven by their manservant
[10:16:52] <twb> they have boats -- the sort big enough that you can go "inside" the boat
[10:18:19] <bpalmer> I think that may be overestimating New Hampshire's affluence just a bit; it's wealthier on average (and, relatedly?, thought of somewhat libertarian), but it's not known as one of the places the truly rich hang out.
[10:18:21] <bpalmer> As far as I know.
[10:18:37] <bpalmer> The really rich are much more concentrated around New York City.

[15:16:40] <Unicorn_Princess> also i've been looking through the c++ and lsp layer docs, and they list a whole bunch of keyboard shortcuts, but nothing about finding declarations. ofc i can go and bind lsp-find-declaration myself, but is there a reason it's not already bound to a prominent key combo? it seems like a very useful thing, am I doing something wrong to rely on it?

[15:18:18] <humasect> Unicorn_Princess: when i find a seemingly useful command unbound in a given mode, i take it as being not the common or encouraged use for said function of mode; but that it is added for convenience or utility
[15:19:25] <Unicorn_Princess> that is exactly my worry, humasect. why would it not be common or encouraged, what should i be doing instead?

[15:23:28] <Unicorn_Princess> perhaps i'll leave this question for another time. jumping head first into emacs, i'm already overwhelmed with stuff to learn, don't need to be changing my workflow simultaneously

[15:25:14] <Unicorn_Princess> it seems everyone is either using emacs for 20+ years, or running away to a different editor >_>

[21:03:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Features can be worth it. And old can sometimes mean lacking significant improvements that make a real difference, like when Debian jumped several Emacs version at once.
[21:03:30] <bremner> Guest95: if you can summarize your question concisely, you may get a better response. Some people are too lazy to click links.
[21:03:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The issue is that Debian's stable also means a stable maintaining of non-critical bugs.
[21:03:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But even then that isn't entirely true. I've found programs that are entirely unusable as packaged.
[21:04:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They don't fail to start, but they fail to run. And the issues are patched in unstable.
[21:04:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (If a program can't do its job at all, I consider that a critical bug)
[21:04:52] <euouae> I mean, you have to appreciate Debian, someone has to do that kind of thing, of stability over new features

[21:30:24] <wgreenhouse> mwnaylor: other than my recommendation to set it up to put everything in one frame, I think it's pretty point and shoot
[21:30:48] <treflip> euouae: Don't know how it performs as a daily driver os. For me, it works very well in containers and VMs, because it's very lightweight, yet still has most of the packages required for enterprise software development.
[21:31:34] <wgreenhouse> mwnaylor: it can diff buffers, files, vc artifacts (M-x vc-ediff, some similar command for magit), and directories
[21:31:45] <chrisb> for some people alpine is all about musl C-library
[21:31:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[21:32:12] <wgreenhouse> it generally does the right thing and generally applying a change is a matter of tapping n and p to pick the hunk and a or b to choose which version
[21:32:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those are its two main focuses. Static linking and small size for emulation/container workloads.

[23:47:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: Possible, but not certain nor guaranteed to contain anything useful.
[23:47:34] <euouae> Aurora_v_kosmose You dont' know that
[23:47:35] <technomancy> that's a loser attitude. the best you can do is to take a job at twitter and sabotage it from the inside.
[23:47:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you compartmentalize your activities.
[23:47:41] <technomancy> go down in legend as a hero
[23:47:42] <euouae> LOL technomancy
[23:47:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> technomancy: That would be admirable.
[23:47:57] <technomancy> let's dream big here people
[23:47:57] <euouae> technomancy I think the ones who do that are not heros, typically work for oppressive regimes
[23:48:15] <technomancy> be the change you want to see in the world euouae
[23:48:20] <technomancy> doesn't have to be that way
[23:48:47] <euouae> I'm not even oppossing surveilance
[23:48:59] <xheimlich> randomize your clicking.
[23:48:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You should.
[23:49:13] <xheimlich> follow people at random.
[23:49:19] <xheimlich> fill the systems with noise.
[23:49:25] <euouae> Randomization is a flag
[23:49:34] <xheimlich> whatever. it's useless to them.
[23:50:21] <xheimlich> the actual sabotage, the sand in the engines, the wooden clog in the machines is behavior.
[23:50:34] <euouae> Aurora_v_kosmose I am opposed in the sense that I would like to find a way to /not/ need it
[23:50:35] <xheimlich> randomize your behavior online.
[23:52:02] <euouae> and e.g. if a company steals my health care info, yeah I'd be pissed

[23:52:24] <crazazy> oh man i have some bolgnese crisps from the lidl
[23:52:32] <crazazy> for some reason they're spicy
[23:52:32] <xheimlich> a true radical will build inconsistent medical histories
[23:52:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: Withholding use unless I share with them information they have no business nor need to know is similarly unethical.
[23:52:51] <crazazy> and that wouldn't be such an issue, if the bottom of the bag wasn't REALLY spicy
[23:52:52] <thuna`> crazazy: what are they supposed to be like normally?
[23:52:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They have no need to know who I am, where I am, or anything similar.
[23:53:09] <crazazy> well, uhh, bolgnese like
[23:53:13] <euouae> Aurora_v_kosmose, What happens on twitter has real-life consequences. It's important to be able to track down criminals
[23:53:17] <crazazy> but like just a bit spicy
[23:53:33] <crazazy> not makes-me-cough spicy
[23:53:34] <xheimlich> Widespread Panic - Contentment Blues.mp4
[23:53:43] * crazazy coughs
[23:54:00] <euouae> crazazy you tried your hardest to hold it and that's admirable :)
[23:54:15] *** Quits: dirtcastle (~dirtcastl@103.43.203.226) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:54:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: And those consequences are themselves a consequence of a platform that contains too much personal information.
[23:54:23] <euouae> I like spicy stuff too, but man... wasabi is the worst
[23:54:37] <euouae> Aurora_v_kosmose nope, that's patently false
[23:54:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The whole crazy and idiotic idea of putting your legal identity everywhere online is responsible.
[23:54:43] <euouae> you need no information to bully someone into suicide
[23:54:52] <ano> is there a way to see buffer local var value with M-x/M-:?
[23:54:56] <xheimlich> euouae: you're probably mixing pi(c?)quant and pungent.
[23:55:04] <thuna`> ano: C-h v works
[23:55:18] <crazazy> my crisps are piquant
[23:55:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: And they need no information to block you, or create new accounts and re-add single individuals.
[23:55:59] <euouae> Aurora_v_kosmose why did you skip over what I just said?
[23:56:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not disabling bots would also allow one to use the age old option of spam filters

[23:56:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: No, I didn't. I saw and considered that your statement ignored the complete implications of my own.
[23:56:43] <euouae> You know what your problem is? You're assuming people are good
[23:56:53] <euouae> and would just play nice on the anonymous twitter.com. They wouldn't. You're wrong.
[23:57:02] <thuna`> Oh wow, we're here now
[23:57:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: Hardly. I'm assuming I can just setup spam filters to block idiots.
[23:57:22] <thuna`> And would those "not good people" /not/ abuse my information?
[23:57:22] *** Quits: benny4 (~benny@lambda.icu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:57:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: Which a protocol-first approach would facilitate greatly.
[23:57:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[23:57:29] <euouae> You're assuming you have an answer to everything that could possibly harm you, which is wrong
[23:57:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: Providing my personal information greatly facilitates taking harassment and attacks offline.
[23:57:52] <euouae> someone could catfish you into a relationship and drive you to commit despicable crimes later on
[23:58:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: How does that differ from the analog method of doing the same with bars & social events?
[23:58:57] <euouae> That's a ridiculous question
[23:59:29] <thuna`> The way to deal with mental health issues is with proper medical/mental care
[23:59:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> euouae: Indeed. That's the point. Nothing new has been added besides the communication medium.
[23:59:48] <euouae> False
