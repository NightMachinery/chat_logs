[00:20:26] <Nothing4You> autoop is not working when you have a large number of channels due to rate limiting, as it will receive "unchallenged" responses with the note that it could be caused by lag
[00:20:49] <Nothing4You> is there any way to fix that besides recompiling the module with a higher timeout?

[00:41:20] <Casper> Poorchop, does the user that runs ZNC have permissions on the .oidentd file? 
[00:41:31] <Poorchop> yes
[00:41:55] <Poorchop> ~/.oidentd is clearly being modified because I see the modified time updated when connecting a server
[00:42:42] <Poorchop> I've been troubleshooting this for hours and I can't tell what's wrong
[00:42:57] <Casper> You've enabled the spoofing like the wiki tells you? :p
[00:43:03] <Poorchop> letter for letter
[00:43:28] <Poorchop> I had this same exact setup working on my other server, only using a different init system
[00:43:49] <Poorchop> but the init system isn't the problem since ~/.oidentd is being read from/written to properly

[01:24:30] <Casper> You can modify your znc.conf and change the bindhost to 1.2.3.4, that shouldn't be an IP available on your box. :P 
[01:24:47] <Casper> So it'll start, but you'll get errors that bindhost can not be set up, but at least it won't connect to servers.
[01:24:59] <Casper> Or just set all the 'active' to 0, heh.
