[06:04:13] <tirnanog> if the perl core is incomplete, I don't see how. you might be better off building the same version of perl on your own machine and preparing the modules you need with cpanm --self-contained or such. that's provided you stick to non-XS modules.
[06:09:28] <ozzzo_work> ok trying that, ty
[06:10:14] *** Quits: kitsunenokenja (~kitsunech@68.91.220.96) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[06:12:14] <tirnanog> in case you've never used cpanm before, it co-operates with local::lib automatically, which should make things a bit easier. and there's plenv (and perlbrew) to handle compiling an older target perl, if necessary.
[06:12:48] <tirnanog> the point of using --self-contained is that will even prepare modules that are normally found in core, which is going to be advantageous in this unfortunate situation.

[06:17:53] <Grinnz> modules built for a different version of perl will not work for the one you're trying to use
[06:18:21] <Grinnz> or even built for a different arch or with certain compilation options different
[06:19:03] <Grinnz> anyway, ExtUtils::MakeMaker can install itself
[06:19:18] <Grinnz> so you should still be able to install it if the perl doesn't have it for whatever reason
[06:19:24] <tirnanog> ah. how's it done?
[06:19:38] <Grinnz> with a cpan installer, like fatpacked cpanm
[06:19:47] <Grinnz> but that will likely have issues if random core modules are missing too
[06:19:51] <tirnanog> yeah.
[06:20:15] <Grinnz> you can also just download teh archive from metacpan and install it the normal way
[06:21:17] <Grinnz> download link on left side of https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker, untar, perl Makefile.PL, make test, make install
[06:21:17] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ ExtUtils::MakeMaker - Create a module Makefile - metacpan.org ]
[06:22:05] <tirnanog> perl Makefile.PL would fail, wouldn't it? it uses itself.
[06:24:54] <Grinnz> yes, it's set up to
[06:24:54] <tirnanog> oh, I see. it just does use lib ".". I didn't even realise.
[06:25:15] <Grinnz> and by normal way i meant gross manual way, because the normal way is with a cpan installer
[06:25:41] <Grinnz> with the manual way you'll either have to install to sitelib, activate a local::lib to install somewhere else, or figure out the incantations to install to a manual location
[06:25:59] <Grinnz> and also you have to install configure dependencies and then build/test/runtime dependencies first, which cpan clients do for you normally
[06:26:06] <Grinnz> EUMM is special so it doesn't have any
[06:26:36] <Grinnz> well thats not true, it has some core modules as runtime requirements which your broken install might also be missing
[06:26:49] <tirnanog> still, if the core is broken, I was thinking that preparing the modules with a non-broken, same-versioned perl might be for the best.
[06:27:11] <tirnanog> or, at least, easier.

[06:52:01] <ozzzo_work> I was thinking I would just run perl locally and ignore their old broken one
[06:52:31] <ozzzo_work> since I'm going to all of this trouble to set it up
[06:53:24] <tirnanog> if you're lacking a working toolchain at the server, you'd then need to go to the trouble of making sure that the environment in which you're building perl matches that of the server.
[06:53:55] <tirnanog> on ther other hand, if you do have a working toolchain at the server, you might be able to just get going with plenv there.
[06:55:33] <tirnanog> the initial solution given entailed just building pure-perl modules that target the same perl version, along with covering core modules where necessary, and copying them over.
[06:57:09] <tirnanog> or, you could try just installing EUMM manually, seeing as Grinnz pointed out that it is, in fact, possible. you would just have to hope that it was the only core module missing that you're going to need.
[06:57:19] <tirnanog> so, 4 potential approaches so far.

[17:44:12] <fling> like I want to know how many mondays in this month
[17:44:14] <fling> etc
[17:44:57] <fling> for example current month has four mondays
[17:44:58] <LeoNerd> I'd probably solve that fairly brute-force by just iterating all the days this month and keeping a hash (or array I guess?) of the counts
[17:45:28] <LeoNerd> my @wday_counts; $wday_counts[ localtime(mktime...)->wday ]++ for (days this month)
[17:46:18] <LeoNerd> Imean, you could optimise it a bit by initialising the array to 4 of each, and then only iterating from the 29th until the end of the month. Which would be zero to three more days
[17:47:52] <LeoNerd> At which point you can further optimise it by simply calculating the wday of the 29th of the month, and bumping that element and a few more, depending on the month

[18:08:03] <LeoNerd> A bunch of things that -could- be warnings, except they're not really problems.. just "eh, you probably didn't mean to do that"
[18:08:13] <LeoNerd> shadowed vars, aliased vars, unused vars, ...
[18:08:21] <LeoNerd> Probably many ideas not involving vars

[18:08:52] <Grinnz> fling: that way would be cleaner
[18:09:09] <fling> so many improvements!
[18:09:38] <Altreus> I still like "4 of each plus whatever the 29th, 30th, and 31st are"
[18:09:39] <Grinnz> if you want to count every day of the week you pretty much have to iterate through every day of the month so you might as well just count their wdays like LeoNerd suggested
[18:10:00] <fling> oh
[18:10:18] <Grinnz> but you can do that with Time::Moment as well
[18:10:28] <fling> so can just start with 4
[18:10:38] <fling> and determine what 29, 30, 31 are
[18:10:42] <fling> add them
[18:10:46] <Altreus> yes
[18:10:49] <Altreus> if they exist
[18:10:50] <fling> smarm
[18:10:53] <fling> smart!
[18:11:04] <Altreus> unless it's whatever that month haj mentioned is
[18:11:42] <Altreus> > At which point you can further optimise it by simply calculating the wday of the 29th of the month, and bumping that element and a few more, depending on the month
[18:11:49] <Altreus> that was LeoNerd's final answer
[18:12:07] <LeoNerd> I didn't even bother to phone a friend
[18:12:39] <Altreus> I was gonna say something really mean

[21:17:01] <gloin> Weird, trying to reverse an IP and it's literally returning the input - what am I goofing on here? print join (".", (reverse ($my_ip)))
[21:17:28] <LeoNerd> join "sep", EXPR  puts EXPR  in list context
[21:17:44] <LeoNerd> reverse() in list context is a listy reverse; i.e. returns a list of elements in the reversed order
[21:17:53] <LeoNerd> Reversing a one-element list doesn't do much
[21:18:03] <LeoNerd> ... also you are join'ing a single-element list anyway
[21:18:07] <LeoNerd> Did you mean to split something?
[21:18:18] <LeoNerd> join ",", reverse split ...   is much more likely
[21:18:49] <gloin> In this case I'm trying to reverse an IP address so 12.34.56.78 becomes 78.56.34.23
[21:19:01] <LeoNerd> OK so you likely wanted to split on dots
[21:19:02] <gloin> 78.56.34.12*
[21:19:14] <gloin> yeah I do want to split on dots :)

[21:21:52] <gloin> I should mention this is a creakingly ancient box, running perl 5.8.8 and the result of what you suggest is simply the last octet so in the above example it just returns 78

[21:34:06] <Grinnz> instead of the whole alarm and eval complication, you could just pass a timeout to the ->ping and 'last' after a success or a maximum number of tries
[21:35:06] <ozzzo_work> ok reading Net::Ping page
[21:35:06] <Grinnz> anyway the usual problem with using Net::Ping is that you need root privileges, the ping executable is setuid
[21:35:57] <Grinnz> consider just using the ping executable with IPC::Run3 or IPC::ReadpipeX

[21:38:52] <ozzzo_work> ok I'll read up on IPC::Run3 and IPC::ReadpipeX
[21:38:59] <Grinnz> it doesn't appear to have any error message mechanism
[21:39:36] <Grinnz> IPC::ReadpipeX has a function you can copypaste without installing anything, it's just a safer way to run commands than backticks
[21:39:45] <Grinnz> IPC::Run3 is pretty great if you have it available
[21:40:44] <Grinnz> you could also use IPC::Run which has builtin timeout features

[22:01:20] <Grinnz> anyway the only thing you can import from IPC::ReadpipeX is the readpipex function, and that's imported by default, so there shouldn't be anything else on the use line

[22:02:13] <ozzzo_work> ok that works
[22:02:17] <Grinnz> if not for exporter's stupid version thing you would have gotten an error like "function 10.193.7.210 is not exported by IPC::ReadpipeX"
[22:03:12] <Grinnz> also why doesn't Exporter croak that message

[22:24:42] <zgu> arch has gotta have a package for it
[22:24:58] <Grinnz> i would assume so
[22:25:24] <Grinnz> but the main point is you can just download and use cpanm regardless of whether it's installed
[22:27:10] <hiya> so how do I uninstall Time::Moment that I installed as sudo
[22:27:38] <ether> you don't
[22:27:50] <Grinnz> sudo cpanm --uninstall Time::Moment; make sure it's removing only from siteperl
[22:27:56] <ether> well you could try, but I wouldn't want to mess with your system perl because if you break *that*, you'll be doing a full OS reinstall
[22:29:04] <Grinnz> the benefit of packagers not installing packlists is cpanm --uninstall won't remove those
[22:29:10] <Grinnz> so that's helpful
[22:29:15] <zgu> and learn about local::lib for next time
[22:30:27] <ether> iirc, anything using Module::Build doesn't leave behind a packlist either
[22:30:33] <ether> or was that just entries in perllocal.pod
[22:30:39] <Grinnz> that's just perllocal

[22:35:28] <Grinnz> the other thing to watch out for is if you installed anything that depends on Time::Moment being there, the cpan clients won't know that anymore; so hopefully you didn't

I think it'd be super helpful if you could move those into the docs for Class::Method::Modifiers. :)
