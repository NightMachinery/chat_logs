[01:55:20] <kittonian> ugh, still dealing with this opcache issue
[01:56:27] <kittonian> i compiled 7.4.22 and enabled fpm and got that all setup and was receiving the same unable to allocate shared memory error when trying to start it. however, i found that if I disable the opcache module from php I can successfully start php-fpm's listener, but of course that does me no good since the module isn't enabled
[01:56:43] <kittonian> i have tried manually setting shm and mmap as the shared memory system, that doesn't work

[02:19:19] <celphi> but you prob just typod
[02:21:33] <Blondie101010> celphi:  you should try to pass on information in a way that most people would follow your thinking...  that is not the case right now
[02:22:17] <celphi> he has ` {$string_to_append}` and my example uses ` " ($some2ndvalue)"`
[02:22:36] <celphi> but he prob meant to use `()`
[02:22:58] <celphi> thanks for answering my question
[02:23:10] <celphi> i see why your exapmle reads better
[02:24:09] <Blondie101010> oh maybe
[02:25:04] <kittonian> is there anyone that can help me with this memory allocation issue? i've got a server that is only partially up right now and really need to solve this
[02:25:26] <kittonian> here's the strace -f of trying to start php-fpm with the opcache module enabled in the php.ini
[02:25:26] <kittonian> https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/RwWPjSnkKv/
[02:26:54] <Blondie101010> kittonian:  the fpm logs should be 1000 times clearer than running strace, unless you really knew what you're doing
[02:27:09] <Blondie101010> if there's nothing in its logs, enable them in the config file
[02:27:19] <__adrian> celphi> but he prob meant to use `()`  // actually no, i just missed your () alltogether
[02:27:25] <__adrian> but easy to fix
[02:28:08] <__adrian> what I see in your example is you're trying to use a ternary expression as a "shorthand" for an if..else block
[02:28:21] <__adrian> ternary ≠ if..else
[02:28:38] <Blondie101010> well it's not very far :)
[02:28:49] <__adrian> and the problem is even more obviosu when you don't actually _have_ an "else" part. here your  else  is "do nothing."
[02:29:39] <__adrian> blondie: it's pretty far. one's an expression that results in a value. the other is a control block that executes code.
[02:30:04] <__adrian> yes, there are use cases where you might use either to get a similar result. that doesn't mean they'
[02:30:11] <__adrian> re interchangable.
[02:32:20] <kittonian> no php-fpm logs because it won't start
[02:34:11] <__adrian> "kittonian> i've got a server that is only partially up right now ..." // sorry, and i don't mean to detract from your immediate problem, but I hope next time you'll remember to use a dev environment before trying something on a live server

[02:44:07] <Byteflux> I actually remember this issue from a while back
[02:44:22] <Byteflux> Someone else had the same issue (maybe it's the same person?) and they were compiling their own PHP
[02:44:33] <Byteflux> Seems like a recurring theme :)
[02:44:41] <Blondie101010> what was the problem?
[02:44:57] <Byteflux> No idea, it was never resolved. The person simply went back to an older PHP.
[02:45:39] <Blondie101010> "Unable to allocate shared memory" is likely the main issue
[02:45:47] <Byteflux> My guess is that compiling your own PHP against outdated libs is a potential issue :P
[02:45:53] <Blondie101010> so ask your sysadmin to test shmem
[02:46:13] <kittonian> i am the sysadmin and I have tested shm and it's working just fine for postgres and apache
[02:46:39] <Byteflux> Not necessarily a compilation problem, just perhaps that a dependent library somewhere is outdated perhaps.
[02:47:36] <TinoDidriksen> Does it work if you start it as root? Could be a permission issue.

[02:50:04] <Byteflux> Unlikely the problem is the kernel itself.

[02:52:48] <Byteflux> This is looking like 4 hours of debugging an issue with multiple solutions :P
[02:59:51] <Byteflux> Nextcloud even has an official Docker image. At this point we're in the realm of tech support for what seems like an obscure use case, so maybe consider doing what millions of other setups are already doing and use the image.
[03:06:08] <Blondie101010> my interpretation of their justification sounded like an attemps at bypassing a 0day vulnerability
[03:08:33] <kittonian> i appreciate the whole redo you entire server suggestion but it's not a possibility. i just need to resolve this issue
[03:09:09] <Byteflux> Spinning up a Docker image is hardly redoing your entire server, but in any case you have fun with that.
[03:09:23] <Blondie101010> can only wish you luck...  I wouldn't spend 15 more minutes on this if any alternative exists
[03:09:29] <Byteflux> Can't really muster the motivation to do tech support for someone who can't be bothered to justify their approach.
[03:09:52] <kittonian> i can explain all i want, but i have a feeling i'll be met with more pushback
[03:10:12] <Byteflux> That is a possibility, yes.
[03:10:15] <kittonian> and i really don't have time to explain my server decisions for the past 15+ years just to resolve this one issue
[03:10:27] <Blondie101010> well your problem is off-topic from the start, though the channel is lenient for things like this
[03:10:34] <kittonian> so i'm asking for help with this issue, which is not uncommon it seems according to google results
[03:10:39] <kittonian> it's not off topic
[03:10:44] <Blondie101010> sorry but it is
[03:10:46] <kittonian> it's directly related to php and the built in opcache module
[03:10:49] <Byteflux> It's basically off-topic, yes.
[03:10:52] <kittonian> that is directly on topic
[03:11:02] <Blondie101010> this channel is for PHP code help
[03:11:14] <Blondie101010> what we've seen so far belongs to OS support
[03:12:25] <Blondie101010> of course we all know that you can't just go on #debian as they'll tell you the same things we did

[05:55:17] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I've got an odd issue with php-fpm. If I post from a form, I get the error: "PHP message: PHP Warning:  Unknown: POST Content-Length of 111 bytes exceeds the limit of 3 bytes in Unknown on line 0'"...
[05:55:51] <bobdobbs> Now I'm used to that error coming from the post_max_size being set too low. But on this instance, the post_max_size is set to 3GB.
[05:56:52] <bobdobbs> I've confirmed the 3GB in my config by setting by creating a file with phpinfo() and looking at the output
[05:57:17] <bobdobbs> When I google for this error, I see the same thing - it *should* be sorted by just pumping up the post_max_size
[05:58:18] <bobdobbs> This is the output of the phpinfo: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/dS44TFDBh3/
[06:01:42] <__adrian> bobdobbs: that's 3 bytes
[06:01:51] <__adrian> "GB" is not a valid unit so it defaults to bytes

[06:41:06] <Rockwood> is costly stuff?

[13:20:49] <AllenJB> The code might be easier to read if you got rid of the commented code, and considered using ?> <?php instead of echo'ing large blocks of html
[13:21:53] <Nomikos> I'd also use single quotes around lines with lots of double quotes, so you don't have to escape them
[13:22:06] <Nomikos> (unless there are variables in there)

[13:28:38] <AllenJB> Large files are typically hard to maintain and navigate. I typically try not to exceed 1000 lines per file. Splitting code into separate files makes it easier to find what you want and makes it clear when editing one piece of code might affect multiple things.
[13:29:46] *** Quits: Yonle (~Yonle@user/yonle) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:30:36] <TinoDidriksen> You should not have ?> at the end.
[13:30:38] <biberu> thehunter: if that's 6000 lines of view code it'd probably be much easier to work with smaller, reusable templates where e.g. their parameters are easier to see, they can be tested in isolation, changed in one place to affect all uses etc

[13:32:04] <biberu> thehunter: +1 to what TinoDidriksen just said, it's better to avoid ?> at the end of files, see https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php
[13:32:42] <thehunter> what u mean with view code?
[13:33:11] <thehunter> why not ?> what instead?
[13:33:26] <biberu> that link explains the problem with ?>
[13:33:28] <TinoDidriksen> Nothing instead.
[13:34:19] <biberu> a view is interface the user sees, e.g. html
[13:34:28] <fahrradToken> the ?> is optional. Omitting it will save you from accidental empty lines after it
[13:34:28] <biberu> is that file only html?
[13:34:37] <biberu> does it also contain e.g. form validation?

[13:42:20] <thehunter> other questions
[13:42:40] <thehunter> is there something i can do like... i have an array and...
[13:43:08] <thehunter> hmm how should i describe... if the variable $abcfoo == any entrys of the arry then do this or that
[13:43:49] <thehunter> like a array has idk 10 entrys or 20.. doesnt matter just if any of these entrys == $abcfoo then do this can i make that in a if loop?
[13:43:53] <Naktibalda> thehunter: !+in_array
[13:43:53] <php-bot> thehunter, bool in_array(mixed needle, array haystack [, bool strict])  - Checks if the given value exists in the array - http://php.net/in_array
[13:44:10] <thehunter> yea but thats not what i mean
[13:44:19] <thehunter> like when the array has $abcfoo several times
[13:45:01] <thehunter> for example in [5] in  [10] and in [21]... and i need to find out in which if its 5 10 or 21
[13:45:05] <thehunter> or only 7
[13:45:44] <thehunter> foreach doesnt work with that what im planning
[13:45:46] <Naktibalda> then use foreach loop and check any conditions you like
[13:46:46] <thehunter> just said foreach doesnt work
[13:46:54] <thehunter> but i just found another solution that could work
[13:46:56] <thehunter> thx anyway

[15:59:57] <Naktibalda> iirc, socket.io does more than just plain websocket connect, so you may need specialist library if you use socket.io on client side: https://packagist.org/explore/?query=socket.io
[16:06:46] <Simplar> Naktibalda: React.js handles the client side, php handles the server side

[16:18:38] <Simplar> Blondie101010: it supports php, so why not?
[16:18:56] <Blondie101010> so you don't know
[16:18:56] <Naktibalda> most likely it only supports request-response model
[16:18:59] <Blondie101010> check with them!
[16:19:30] <Naktibalda> so you can't run anything for longer than 30 seconds and you are not allowed to start daemons
[16:19:44] <Blondie101010> and ports being blocked, etc
[16:20:08] <Blondie101010> everything could even be going through a reverse proxy

[19:36:04] <aruns> Hi, is it possible to change the path resolution for require_once (if an absolute path is provided) on PHP7.4?
[19:36:23] <aruns> It looks like set_include_path only works if the path supplied is a relative path
[19:38:21] <__adrian> it only makes sense on relative paths
[19:38:49] <__adrian> also, strongly recommend always using fully qualified paths. relying on include_path is sloppy and error-prone.
[19:39:20] <AllenJB> aruns: What problem are you trying to solve?
[19:39:25] <__adrian> absolute path === i know exactly which file i want
[19:39:31] <__adrian> this ^ is desirable
[19:40:29] <aruns> AllenJB: Need to override a function on a WordPress plugin
[19:40:41] <aruns> I suspect I will have to make a copy of the plugin
[19:41:06] <aruns> But it includes the file containing the plugin function (which isn't pluggable) via a fully qualified path in a require_once statement
[19:41:07] <__adrian> might, if they didn't make the path in question configurable
[19:41:32] <aruns> Tbh, most WordPress plugins don't seem to follow any conventions

[21:09:28] <onizu> hi. Is there a filter to check for a blank string for type INPUT_POST ?
[21:13:08] <Rockwood> onizu, by many ways
[21:13:24] <Rockwood> by empty too
[21:13:28] <Rockwood> by empty() too
[21:13:33] <onizu> i mean using a PHP filter
[21:14:22] <__adrian> i don't know what you mean by "php filter"
[21:14:25] <__adrian> filter_var() ?
[21:16:11] <Rockwood> https://3v4l.org/1IlNn
[21:16:18] <Rockwood> oops okay
[21:17:32] <onizu> __adrian: yes, like filter_var()
[21:17:35] <Rockwood> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filter-var.php
[21:18:20] <__adrian> no. but also, if there were such a filter, it wouldn't be all that useful. use  $value === ""
[21:18:22] <onizu> I'm looking for a filter (say to use with filter_var) that checks for empty strings
[21:18:27] <onizu> ok
[21:19:13] <__adrian> you could make a callback to use with filter_var but like i said, would be more a waste of time than benefit in this case.
[21:19:26] <onizu> k
[21:21:38] <Rockwood> yes strict chk
[21:23:13] <onizu> __adrian: https://3v4l.org/aPm2W  -- when I'm trying to do something like this,  why am I getting: "array_filter() expects parameter 2 to be a valid callback, function 'checkForEmptyString' not found or invalid function name" ? It works in 3v4l
[21:25:09] <__adrian> don't define functions inside of functions
[21:26:20] <__adrian> why wouldn't you use an anon function here?
[21:26:45] <onizu> "why wouldn't you use an anon function here?" --how?
[21:27:04] <__adrian> do you know what an anonymous function is?
[21:28:28] <Rockwood> callback function
[21:28:37] <deltab> https://3v4l.org/JIsDC
[21:29:00] <__adrian> or even https://3v4l.org/QK2Ij
[21:29:24] <Rockwood> i think its too much complicated
[21:29:39] <onizu> __adrian: like this: https://3v4l.org/gn21o ?
[21:30:03] <__adrian> yes
[21:30:08] <onizu> hah, deltab did exactly the same
[21:30:28] <onizu> ok
[21:30:28] <Rockwood> arrayStrInput($dataArray) validate here instead any where
[21:30:41] <__adrian> though could be much shorter. also, you're assuming that (a) $dataArray is an array (b) every item in $dataArray is a string
[21:31:36] <onizu> I don't understand this syntax: fn ($value) => trim($value) != ''
[21:31:53] <__adrian> also, your function silently discards invalid inputs, rather than rejecting them. this will likely cause problems eventually.
[21:32:07] <onizu> you're assuming that (a) $dataArray is an array (b) every item in $dataArray is a string -- yes
[21:32:08] <__adrian> "onizu> I don't understand this syntax: fn ($value) => trim($value) != ''"  // compare it to your function.
[21:32:16] <__adrian> tl;dr: it does the same thing
[21:32:40] <onizu> what are invalid inputs in this case?
[21:33:23] <onizu> $dataArray is actually $_POST['arrayVar']  .. all values here would be string
[21:33:34] <__adrian> no. that's an unfounded assumption.
[21:33:45] <__adrian> i could POST whatever i like  :)
[21:33:52] <onizu> I never saw $_POST returning an int
[21:34:00] <__adrian> who said it would?
[21:34:05] <deltab> could be an array?
[21:34:09] <__adrian> ^
[21:34:13] <onizu> then why should I check if it's not a string?
[21:34:28] <__adrian> because you don't KNOW that it's a string. that's a nonsense assumption.
[21:34:31] <onizu> well I know which form it is and it is not sending an array
[21:34:40] <__adrian> your form is completely irrelevant
[21:34:43] <__adrian> i could POST whatever i like  :)
[21:34:58] <onizu> from where, if not the form
[21:35:09] <__adrian> anywhere
[21:35:13] <__adrian> from another form. from curl.
[21:35:15] <onizu> o.o
[21:35:18] <__adrian> anywhere
[21:35:29] <onizu> ok ...
[21:35:39] <__adrian> there's no magic that prevents me from posting to your endpoint.
[21:36:00] <__adrian> even if i did use your form, there's nothing preventing me from changing it first.
[21:36:14] <onizu> changing the form? how?
[21:36:19] <deltab> web inspector
[21:36:20] <__adrian> ...
[21:36:27] * biberu senses that someone has a lot of form validation to review
[21:36:39] <deltab> or select a request in the network panel, 'Edit and resend'
[21:36:40] <Rockwood> biberu, o/ how are you?
[21:36:42] <__adrian> if forms were required and infallable, there'd be no need to do validation on the server side at all

[21:57:54] <__adrian> code is duplicated if two functions are meant to do exactly the same thing. NOT if their code happens to be similar/identical.
[21:58:50] <__adrian> e.g.,  function twoSquared() : int { return 4; }  function tenMinusSix() : int { return 4; }
[21:59:00] <__adrian> these have identical implementations
[21:59:06] <__adrian> they are NOT "repeated code."
