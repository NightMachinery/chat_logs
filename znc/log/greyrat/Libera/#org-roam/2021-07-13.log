[12:03:27] <zaeph> Wasn't there someone who asked me question here prior to going on holiday?
[12:03:41] <zaeph> asked me a* question
[12:09:08] <cipherrot> zaeph: looking back in the room history from matrix, all i can see is many "when will v2 be released?" questions ;)
[12:09:55] <zaeph> cipherrot: Thanks; I'll safely duck that one, then. :o)
[12:10:33] <cipherrot> >_<
[12:11:00] <empwilli_> zaeph: I had a question about links to inline images; i can dig it up an paste it ;)
[12:11:12] <zaeph> Sure, feel free to do so.

[12:12:16] <cipherrot> i realise now that history only goes back to 27 june when i triggered the bridge by joining it from matrix
[12:12:42] <zaeph> And re: v2; I'm just starting to have the headspace and timespace to get back to maint, and as much as I'd love to tell you Soonâ„¢, we're not going to version-bump until we've ironed out all the kinks.
[12:13:07] <cipherrot> <3
[12:13:15] <zaeph> empwilli_: Looks like greedy parsing on our end; can you replicate it on master?
[12:15:09] <empwilli_> I'll have a look into it tonight; I have some broken network mount on my hands right now :)
[12:15:15] <empwilli_> but yeah, thanks already :)
[12:16:21] <zaeph> Do take your time, I'm not going anywhere.  I'll be around here more henceforth, so we can triage stuff here rather than resorting to GH issues.
