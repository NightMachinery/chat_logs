[03:12:26] <SunRaycer_> ok, help!  my primary window with the most tabs has just vanished.  I don't understand how.  I didn't consciously close it nor press a key to confirm such a closure.
[03:13:29] <SunRaycer_> Is there any way to revive such a window?  I know I can revive recently closed tabs within one window with <shift><control>t
[03:14:17] <keir> SunRaycer_: not unless it was a saved session
[03:14:56] <keir> SunRaycer_: thought `:undo` also works on windows
[03:15:02] <keir> s/thought/though/
[03:15:49] <keir> SunRaycer_: https://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/commands.html#undo
[03:21:36] <SunRaycer_> "nothing to undo".  :-P
[03:24:21] <keir> SunRaycer_: did you apply the window flag?
[03:39:33] <keir> SunRaycer_: i'd say there's nothing you can do to restore the window then. this may be a lesson to use `:w` every so often when you have important tabs open.
[03:39:36] <SunRaycer_> yes
[03:39:42] <SunRaycer_>  :undo -w
[03:40:25] <SunRaycer_> well, I did do that the previous time I closed it
[03:41:18] <keir> SunRaycer_: `:session-load` will list your saved sessions and allow you to open them
[03:42:12] <keir> make sure there's a space after the command to see the list.
[03:42:29] <keir> tabbing works too

[03:49:42] <SunRaycer_> good lord.  that's weird.  the original window came back.  so it was hiding somewhere that I could not alt-tab to find, but doing the session-load default somehow made it visible again.

[14:35:38] <The-Compiler> schemefusion: as for youtube, see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/6480

[14:47:38] *** Joins: hvxgr (~wl2v_usrn@epjdn.zq3q.org)
[14:59:39] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: hi, I was wondering how I can test https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/3051 in isolation to verify my changes. I was thinking of extracting the logic into a separate function so I can unit test that, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.
[15:00:29] <pylbrecht> besides that one comes to my mind are manual tests by setting up virtualenvs with the corresponding libraries (one with webkit, one with webengine)
[15:01:34] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: I suppose this one isn't really possible to test in isolation in a good way, but given its part of the test machinery it will get used even by the CI and such, so it should be noticable if things are wrong.
[15:03:49] <pylbrecht> fair enough, thanks for your input!
[15:06:17] <schemefusion> The-Compiler: What's colorama?  Looking at the output of :version
[15:06:30] <schemefusion> I don't have adblock
[15:09:16] *** Quits: mornfall (~mornfall@user/mornfall) (Remote host closed the connection)

[15:13:13] <schemefusion> ThinkT510: Thanks.  I'm on it
[15:14:27] <schemefusion> ThinkT510: sadly, there's no adblock package in Fedora's repo.  I have the option of pip
[15:18:05] <ThinkT510> I've never used pip. I've heard you'll need to be careful regarding conflicts of pip installed packages and distro installed software
[15:19:20] <schemefusion> ThinkT510: yes, you avoid that by installing as a user (not with root).
[15:20:16] <schemefusion> All done.  Qutebrowser loaded adblock.  Thanks ThinkT510 and The-Compiler

[17:32:35] <pylbrecht> is there an easy way to make linters happy (like running black)?
[17:36:20] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: not so far unfortunately. The last time I tried to adopt black it had too many bugs. I plan to give it another try, but in early 2022 with the Qt 6 changes, as I want to look at the PR backlog again first, given that the resulting code churn will make them all conflict.
[17:37:09] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: the flake8 issue was from the master branch btw, should be fixed now
[17:39:56] <The-Compiler> (the Qt 6 changes will also introduce a lot of churn, so it makes sense to combine the two, after hopefully getting the PR backlog down a bit, but I won't be able to do that before Jan or Feb)

[17:46:22] <pylbrecht> I see. So manual fix it is for now.
[17:47:19] <The-Compiler> yup
[17:48:01] <The-Compiler> for a while I also wasn't convinced that black was a good idea, but that changed
[17:49:34] <pylbrecht> we use it at work and I have to admit, once properly set up (we're using pre-commit hooks), it's just very convenient. Although setup took some fiddling in the beginning.
[17:50:21] <pylbrecht> we introduced it into a huge project at some point and a colleague brought up a neat trick to hide the commit containing all the formatting changes, so git blame would still give back a useful history.
[17:51:02] <pylbrecht> although that only works with lines that changed and not lines that have been added by that commit
[17:52:05] <The-Compiler> I'm not even too concerned about blame, with 8 years of history you often need to dig down into something anyways
[17:59:14] <schemefusion> The-Compiler: I only installed adblock via pip.  Others are system-wide
[17:59:59] <The-Compiler> yeah that makes sens
[18:00:02] <The-Compiler> sense even
[18:00:32] <The-Compiler> I'm just saying installing as user rather than root is not a guarantee against conflicts in general
[18:01:04] <schemefusion> okay.  I've learned one today.  I will try to remember that.
[18:05:35] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: is there a policy about squashing commits before they are merged?
[18:06:25] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: I usually prefer keeping the history, especially if it shows multiple approaches or other interesting information towards a goal
[18:06:56] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: if its just linting fixes, it's fine to squash, but I also won't mind if its not
[18:07:22] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: alright, so a clean history is preferred. Got it!
[18:09:22] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: btw, is it intended that you didn't change the argument/env var yet?

[18:14:11] <rj1> qutebrowser is my favorite browser i've ever used
[18:14:36] <The-Compiler> mine too, I think :D
[18:16:19] <keir> The-Compiler: you're an emacs user aren't you?
[18:16:27] <The-Compiler> keir: was!
[18:16:41] <keir> oh no, what's happened? :O
[18:17:07] <The-Compiler> keir: from vim to emacs (with vim bindings) to VS Code (with vim plus spacemacs-like bindings)
[18:17:50] <The-Compiler> switched half a year ago or so, and VS Code is really quite nice with some extensions, despite being by MS and an Electron thing
[18:18:09] <The-Compiler> then again emacs isn't exactly lightweight either :D
[18:18:32] <The-Compiler> should probably write a blog post about my dev setup one day
[18:19:09] <rj1> i love neovim!!!
[18:19:20] <keir> The-Compiler: i'm sure people would be interested given the project you maintain!
[18:19:44] <keir> The-Compiler: i was always curious about the fact you were a maintainer of a vi-like browser but used emacs
[18:19:45] <The-Compiler> yeah and it would give blog.qutebrowser.org some fresh life too
[18:19:48] <The-Compiler> lol
[18:19:58] <keir> but i guess evil mode makes more sense
[18:19:59] <rj1> i can't stomach using vscode though i know it's very good, neovim is just as great as an IDE if you take the time to configure it
[18:20:06] <rj1> i do not like microsoft!!!
[18:20:17] <The-Compiler> I tried having some IDE like infrastructure in vim, and it was a pain
[18:20:35] <rj1> yeah, it really takes awhile to make it work for you, but now i found the time investment well worth it
[18:20:39] <The-Compiler> that was before neovim, and after switching away from emacs I did try neovim for a bit
[18:20:57] <keir> i find ALE is good enough for me. all i need is some decent linting and formatting integration
[18:21:15] <keir> vim is smart enough to make refactoring easy withouth an LSP
[18:21:18] <The-Compiler> also emacs has the only git integration which is better than the git cli, and vs code has a clone of it
[18:21:31] <The-Compiler> https://magit.vc
[18:22:10] <keir> The-Compiler: ever tried gitui?
[18:22:22] <keir> Rust git tui
[18:24:17] <keir> they have a sample vi mappings config in the source repo too
[18:25:09] <The-Compiler> keir: never heard of it!
[18:25:29] <The-Compiler> but I'm rather happy with https://github.com/kahole/edamagit now
[18:25:49] <keir> https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui
[18:31:08] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: CI is still churning, but if tests pass, I'd consider this ready for review.
