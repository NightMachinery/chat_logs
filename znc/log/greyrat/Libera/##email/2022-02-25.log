[08:31:26] <pekster> I'm exploring Google's Workplace (formerly G-Suite) options, but not making sense of their 'SMTP FROM' negotiation for a secondary domain. GMail receives both a primary & subdomain (MX, SPF, DKIM all configured), eg: example.com & sub.example.com. I have a catch-all rewrite on GMail for .*@sub\.example\.com regex to my primary account.
[08:32:00] * jaybe excuses to ðŸ¤® 
[08:32:04] <pekster> All that works, but when I *send* it performs outbound SMTP negotiation with my recipient's mailservers using the 'SMTP FROM' of my primary account; the whole point is to use vendor-specific accounts to avoid getting on spam-lists, but I can't seem to do that.
[08:33:09] <pekster> Is this is just an annoying limitation of GMail's business? I'd be better off with postfix somewhere to do all the sending, but was kind of hoping I could force the G-stuff not to intentionally leak whoever the main account is if I've already done their silly verification dance.
[08:35:11] <pekster> Re-writing for my example above, here's the primary problem when I send a test message: I send from 'test-vendor@sub.example.com' but my recipient account sees a resulting header: Return-Path: <admin@example.com>

[13:59:24] <MrBech> Hi. After how many bounces should I remove a recipient from my mailing list?
[13:59:57] <Khepra> the less the better
[14:01:41] <MrBech> I wouldn't assume 1 bounce. Since it happens that I see bounces and then the following emails are received
[14:02:03] <MrBech> I have set it to 4 bounces max, then my system removes the user.
[14:02:18] <Khepra> sounds right.
[14:02:36] <Khepra> can you differentiate consecutive vs total?
[14:04:02] <MrBech> Please elaborate?
[14:05:09] <MrBech> I have a counter on the user that +1 on each bounce. If an email is delivered, the counter is set to 0. At 4, the user is removed.
[14:05:57] <henk> MrBech: if I was designing such a system, Iâ€™d probably try something like: "after 2 consecutive bounces, delay for 12h, then after another one, delay for 24h, then after another one drop the address". any mail that goes through resets the "consecutive bounces" counter. if X bounces over Y days is exceeded, try sending a mail to the address that there are problems with delivery.
[14:06:01] <Khepra> right, so it's counting 4 consecutives. that's good
[14:06:03] <Khepra> MrBech: ^
[14:06:25] <henk> for x=10, y=30 or something
[14:10:25] <MrBech> I just noticed, that the same email, could fire more than one bounce message through webhooks. I until now, thought the same email could only fire 1 bounce-report (I'm using Sparkpost). Which means I should probably ramp up the max 4, to maybe 10
[14:11:56] <MrBech> @henk I don't see a point in sending an email that informs the user about deliverability issues. As every delivery, open or click, will reset the bounce-counter. So the regular emails will work as an indicator
[14:12:30] <pj> MrBech: I would say it depends on the type of bounce.  Eg: if the bounce is for mailbox quota exceeded then you should try again almost indefinately, but if it's for invalid user then remove them right away.
[14:13:13] <pj> I believe there are different response codes (and extended response codes) for different types of bounces like that.
[14:13:55] <MrBech> @pj I agree. I do have an array of bounce codes, that I classify as "soft bounces", if it's a soft-bounce, the bounce counter will not go up. List of soft bounce codes: 20, 22, 23, 24, 60, 100
[14:14:43] <MrBech> In human text those are: soft bounce, mailbox full, email is too large, timeout, auto-reply/vacation email, challenge-response
[14:14:44] <pj> yep, I'd have to look those up to see what they are and i'm too busy/lazy to do it right now, though.  ;-)
[14:15:29] <pj> email is too large depends, I think.  And I would not include challenge/response in that list.
[14:15:51] <MrBech> so a challenge-response you would consider a hard bounce?
[14:16:02] <pj> If I understand what it is correctly, yes.
[14:16:24] <MrBech> Alright
[14:18:46] <pj> If I understand correctly it's a response that indicates that some sort of response is required to a server challenge.  You're never going to provide the correct response barring some sort of manual intervention.
[14:19:58] <MrBech> Makes sense. Thank you
