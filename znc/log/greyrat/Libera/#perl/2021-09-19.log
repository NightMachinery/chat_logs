[00:06:21] *** Joins: sasho (~sasho@80.72.92.226.coresnet.bg)
[00:06:44] <sasho> Hello how can I get the pos of a named match so I can do replacement in the original string
[00:06:57] <sasho> like the first and last
[00:07:23] <sasho> thanks
[00:08:12] <aquanight> hmm
[00:09:21] <aquanight> I think I vaguely remember trying to find a way to determine which numbered capture corresponded to a named group programmatically
[00:09:25] <aquanight> that would probably be the way to go
[00:09:48] <aquanight> if you actually know the pattern you're using, you can of course just find the numbered position of the named capture (named captures still take a numbered position)
[00:09:52] <aquanight> and then use @+/@- normally
[00:11:03] <Grinnz> if possible it's best to do these things in a single s///
[00:11:06] <aquanight> perlbot: sweval my $x = "abc"; $x =~ m/(?'a'.)(?'b'.)(?'c'.); keys %+;
[00:11:08] <perlbot> aquanight: ERROR: Search pattern not terminated at (IRC) line 1. 
[00:11:22] <aquanight> Grinnz: I think he is trying to replace specifically the text captured by the named capture, rather than the entire matched string
[00:11:34] <aquanight> Grinnz: I'm not sure how one would do that with s/// myself
[00:11:38] <aquanight> perlbot: sweval my $x = "abc"; $x =~ m/(?'a'.)(?'b'.)(?'c'.)/; keys %+;
[00:11:40] <perlbot> aquanight: 3
[00:11:42] <Grinnz> in many cases you can arrange the regex so only that part is replaced
[00:11:50] <aquanight> perlbot: sweval my $x = "abc"; $x =~ m/(?'a'.)(?'b'.)(?'c'.)/; $+{a} = 'd'; $x;
[00:11:52] <Grinnz> but that's why i said "if possible"
[00:11:52] <perlbot> aquanight: ERROR: Modification of a read-only value attempted at (IRC) line 1. 
[00:12:15] <Grinnz> would need actual details to tell if it's possible
[00:13:05] <aquanight> perlbot: sweval my $x = "abc"; $x =~ m/(?'a'.)(?'b'.)(?'c'.)/; [ "".\$1, "".\$2, "".\$3, "".\$+{a} ]
[00:13:07] <perlbot> aquanight: ["SCALAR(0x5638554e6940)","SCALAR(0x563855571a88)","SCALAR(0x56385568adc0)","SCALAR(0x563855702f08)"]
[00:16:09] <sasho> Well I'm trying to do something like this: https://l.perl.bot/raw/9s4ase
[00:16:39] <sasho> I want to replace all 'bar's inside < and > but not in ( and )
[00:17:16] <Grinnz> looks like a job for Text::Balanced or a real parser
[00:22:33] <sasho> nvm I think I've found it - seems to be like $+[arg] and $-[arg]
[00:23:22] <Grinnz> those are the positions for the positional captures aquanight mentioned
[00:23:31] <Grinnz> you hve to know the numbered position of the capture for that
[00:24:31] <Grinnz> array indexes are numbers
[00:24:45] <sasho> oh ok

[18:26:59] <rindolf> sasho: hi
[18:27:17] <lopid> those parens are just used for grouping, you've no need to double them. or use any here for that matter
[18:27:48] <rindolf> perlbot: references
[18:27:49] <perlbot> rindolf: For information about references in perl, see the built-in perldocs: http://p3rl.org/REF , or if that fails: http://perl-begin.org/topics/references/ . | http://mvp.kablamo.org/basics/references/
[18:28:19] <lopid> and your $word represents each value of the reversed array, so it's just a scalar here. print $word
[18:30:22] <sasho> but I've read on the perldoc that push appends another array
[18:30:29] <sasho> that's why I used double braces
[18:30:36] <keir> am I right in thinking sasho's code results in one flat 1D array?
[18:31:04] <sasho> I want to push an array
[18:31:07] <_73> sasho: `my @arr1 = (1,2); my @arr2 = (3,4); my @arr3 = (@arr1, @arr2);` In this case @arr3 is @arr1 and @arr2 appended. Unlike in many languages where this would give an array of arrays, perl automatically flattens arrays.
[18:31:38] <lopid> it can push an arrayref onto an array: push @array, [ 1, 2 ]
[18:32:50] <sasho> thanks but how do I access it after
[18:33:03] <sasho> I tried `@{$word}[0]`
[18:33:09] <lopid> push @array, [ 1, 2 ]; push @array, [ 2, 3 ]; foreach $word ( reverse @array ) { print $word->[0], $word->[1] }
[18:33:13] <lopid> is that what you meant?
[18:33:25] <sasho> I think so yeah thanks
[18:33:52] <sasho> It works - thanks again :)
[18:33:58] <lopid> you're welcome
[18:34:24] <sasho> so basically the square brackets creates a reference - but then why something like \() doesn't too
[18:35:11] <keir> is there a difference between @$array_ref and @{$array_ref}?
