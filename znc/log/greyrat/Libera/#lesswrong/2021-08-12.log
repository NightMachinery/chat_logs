[00:01:58] <dbohdan> namespace_: Good point.  I've thought about learning smart contract development, because it's lucrative and futuristic.  However, my reason for not getting into it is outside view + anxiety.  Smart contracts seem to lose a lot of money to hacking.  I don't think I'd sleep at night if I had a smart contract of any value deployed.

Through the end of high school, Kassell would get up, go to school, and then race over to the lab where he’d sometimes sleep over to tend to his experiments through the night, crashing for cat naps on the benches in the lab, in the recovery rooms, or on the operating room tables themselves. Then he would get up and do the whole thing again. After two years of
[00:32:16] <feepbot> maintaining this brutal schedule, he finished high school and enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. While there he continued to work in the lab, but his subsequent years of burning the candle at both ends took a toll on his grades. When his class was ready to graduate, the university informed him he was nowhere close to walking in commencement. His cumulative GPA was 1.1 out
[00:32:16] <feepbot> of 4—basically averaging a failure. He would have to repeat many classes. “They told me if I wanted to graduate, I’d have to go for another two and a half years, which I didn’t find appealing,” Kassell says. So instead, he took the unlikely route of applying to medical school with no college degree at all. He was accepted—but the only reason, he says, was that he had
[00:32:21] <feepbot> done so much work in the lab. He had so many publications by then that several neurosurgical residency programs were already grooming him for one of their coveted residency spots, even supplying him with acceptance letters for four years down the line when he completed medical school. “In the unlikely event I ever got into medical school,” Kassell says.'

Rob Wiblin: That would have been pretty early on. Chris Olah: Yeah, this was in 2012 or 2013. The reason that I met him was I was friends with Dario Amodei, who at that time was a grad student. And Dario, somehow, despite being on a grad
[00:37:17] <feepbot> student’s stipend, was giving what was probably a fiscally irresponsible amount of his stipend to GiveWell, and that led to him meeting Holden. I ended up getting dinner with Holden and Dario. During the dinner I pitched Holden on how I was working on 3D printers, and how I thought if we can have open-source tools for 3D printers we’d be able to go and bring 3D printers to
[00:37:17] <feepbot> everyone, and maybe we’d end scarcity and stuff like this. And Holden just really shot it down. At the time I was very miffed. Chris Olah: Actually, the thing that Holden said was, I don’t think this is valuable, but it seems like a great way for you to develop skills. At the time, I was really miffed. But in retrospect, it was actually a very useful thing for him to say. I
[00:37:22] <feepbot> think this is a common theme of talking to Holden. I feel miffed at him sometimes, and then very often I’m very grateful for the things that he says.'

[01:06:49] <two2thehead> "Research over the last three decades reveals that Openness to Experience—a personality trait that captures interest in novelty, creativity, unconventionalism, and open-mindedness—correlates negatively with political conservatism. Here, we summarise this vast literature by meta-analysing 232 unique samples (N = 575,691) that examine the relationship between the Big Five and conservatism. Results reveal that the negative relationship betw
[01:06:49] <two2thehead> een Openness to Experience and conservatism is nearly twice as big as the next strongest correlation between personality and ideology (namely, Conscientiousness and conservatism; rs = −.145 and .076, respectively). The associations between traits and conservatism were, however, substantively smaller in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) countries. We conclude by reviewing recent longitudinal work demonstrating tha
[01:06:50] <two2thehead> t Openness to Experience and conservatism are non-causally related. Collectively, our chapter shows that Openness to Experience is by far the strongest (negative) correlate of conservatism, but that there is little evidence to suggest that this association is causal."

[01:31:49] <kuudes> "Overall, a median of 41% say restrictions on public activity where they live in response to the pandemic were about right. A sizable share – 37% – think more restrictions would have been appropriate. Just 18% say there should have been fewer restrictions on public activity over the course of the coronavirus outbreak. Greece is the only country polled where a plurality of adults (43%) favor fewer limitations."
[01:31:59] <kuudes> "In some publics, half or more think COVID-19 restrictions were too limited over the past year and a half. For example, 62% of Japanese adults think there should have been more restrictions, as do 56% of American adults. (Japan and the U.S. also received some of the worst ratings for their coronavirus responses from their own publics.) "
[01:32:07] <kuudes> "Still, many publics think that their governments implemented the right restrictions on public activity. New Zealand – which has won praise for its coronavirus response and has recorded only 26 coronavirus-related deaths at the time of writing – has the highest share who say restrictions were about right at 80%.

[02:11:11] <kuudes> given finland now has track record that we have indeed managed to stop local spread twice, should we now cease control?
[02:11:29] <adiabatic> define "control"
[02:11:35] <kuudes> we are still getting all doses delivered to arms
[02:11:54] <kuudes> there is 1.5 week buffer for logistics, but about the same amount of doses go in and out
[02:11:56] <adiabatic> are you at the point where everyone who wants a jab can get one?
[02:12:00] <kuudes> no
[02:12:12] <kuudes> we have only started 12 years olds this week
[02:12:24] <kuudes> and plenty of people have not got their second dose
[02:12:31] <adiabatic> then definitely don't let up yet and wear ffp2 masks when you're indoors around other people
[02:12:56] <kuudes> well schools started today again
[02:13:08] <kuudes> but thanks
[02:13:14] <kuudes> I am under some amount of stress
[02:13:23] <kuudes> as it seems to me that the course of action should be clear
[02:13:34] <kuudes> but then I seem to be bombarded with "give up" messages
[02:13:34] <adiabatic> have you and your wife gotten any kind of vax yet and what type
[02:13:37] <kuudes> yes
[02:13:40] <kuudes> pfizer, 2 doses
[02:13:45] <adiabatic> good enough
[02:13:54] <kuudes> our older daughter has 2/3 chance to have got pfizer, 2 doses
[02:13:54] <adiabatic> how old are your kids? 5, tops?
[02:13:57] <kuudes> 8
[02:13:59] <kuudes> and 6
[02:14:15] <adiabatic> young enough. don't stress about it unless you're around old people you really care about
[02:14:36] <kuudes> my parents and her parents have got their astrazeneca * 2 and pfizer * 2 doses
[02:14:47] <adiabatic> I go to the gym with a for-show-only cloth mask, but then again the gym isn't heavily populated when I go
[02:14:58] <RiversHaveWings> ...Why are my iron levels low

[02:15:07] <RiversHaveWings> I had a blood test done this morning.
[02:15:22] <adiabatic> RiversHaveWings: are you eating red meat and has it been that time of the month recently?
[02:15:23] <kuudes> I started to use ffp3 mask now, and it felt much better than my previous ffp2
[02:15:36] <kuudes> though the ffp3 has exhaust valve
[02:15:39] <RiversHaveWings> adiabatic: I'm eating red meat and don't have periods
[02:15:51] <adiabatic> RiversHaveWings: I'm out of guesses, then
[02:16:02] <RiversHaveWings> ...Does this mean I can take iron supplements and be *even more* productive
[02:16:06] <kuudes> did you get a astrazeneca or similar?
[02:16:11] <RiversHaveWings> kuudes: nope
[02:16:20] <kuudes> ok, then blood clots are out as well
[02:16:24] <RiversHaveWings> I got a booster shot recently but it was Pfizer.
[02:16:31] <linear> it is probably worth seeing if supplementation (or better imo, a diet change) would fix it RiversHaveWings, could have something uncommon/irregular related to it 
[02:16:32] <kuudes> how low is low?
[02:16:40] <adiabatic> on the other other hand, I have no idea if 85°C saunas kill the 'rona particles. then again, I got the vax so I wouldn't have to white-knuckle going to the gym in a lame mask
[02:17:00] <RiversHaveWings> Iron: 37 mcg/dL
[02:17:08] <RiversHaveWings> It says the normal range is 50-212.
[02:17:26] <RiversHaveWings> TIBC 331 mcg/dL, which is normal
[02:17:42] <RiversHaveWings> But dividing the two gives % Saturation: 11%
[02:17:48] <RiversHaveWings> And normal is 20-50%.
[02:17:48] <adiabatic> are there things one can eat that will suck iron out of your body, like how broccoli will suck iodine out of your system
[02:18:19] <kuudes> hmm, over here the guideline is 9 - 34 	µmol/l I wonder how that is in mcg/dL
[02:18:21] <Dyo> antioxidants can do that
[02:19:18] <adiabatic> re: ffp3: I like my N100 mask a little bit more than my N95 sometimes because the part that touches my face is wider. I can get a good seal with a week's worth of facial hair on my N100, whereas with my N95 it's kind of iffy
[02:19:19] <kuudes> hmm, iron levels can apparently also be poisoneous if too high
[02:19:22] <RiversHaveWings> Yes
[02:19:28] <kuudes> so maybe not self tune without good info
[02:19:53] <kuudes> adiabatic, yes, ffp3 fit is much better. I was surprised that breathing also was easier with it
[02:19:54] <adiabatic> …is it just me, or is it weird that we have units differences between the US and Europe even though everyone's using metric for this?
[02:20:08] <kuudes> I agree it is weird
[02:21:18] <kuudes> hmm, https://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/snk03356 says males 2-19.5 mcg/dL, females 1.5-12.5 mcg/dL

[02:21:39] <kuudes> I think there are at least 2 different iron measures, as RiversHaveWings showed as well
[02:26:39] <feepbot> <gwern> 'multi-task models. Whereas current AI systems are trained for specific tasks and learn new tasks from scratch each time — a multi-task model enables a system to do thousands of tasks and leverage that expertise to complete totally new tasks. Likewise, Dean believes we should train AI across images, text, sound and video simultaneously — rather than just one-by-one, as
[02:26:39] <feepbot> current systems do. Lastly, he advocates for “sparse models” (instead of current dense models, which activate a whole system for each task) that would only activate relevant parts for a given task (much like the human brain). Drawing on these ideas, Dean reveals publicly for the first time the next phase in Google’s AI plans: a new system called Pathways, which aims to
[02:26:39] <feepbot> generalize across millions of tasks and take a major step forward in how we build powerful, responsible artificial intelligence.' https://blog.ted.com/tech-comeback-notes-from-session-5-of-tedmonterey/

In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now." Ehrlich said, "I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971," and "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred

[08:32:46] <ggreer> the climate change people are worried about more intense weather causing problems
[08:33:29] <ggreer> but 1. we can forecast weather. 2. it's not hard to prevent most of the damage. 3. it's pretty easy to rebuild as long as you're a developed country
[08:33:41] <gwern> wealth is the all-purpose good
[08:34:04] <ggreer> even a disaster like the tohoku quake did... almost nothing to japan. they could have a tohoku every year and be fine

[11:19:59] <quanticle> "The Pullman Company in 1916 provides a good example. Pullman had a sprawling factory with 35 departments organized to produce rail cars. Many departments were dependent on the brass works, where seven managers and 350 workers cast brass parts. The brass department was a mess - orders came in from all over the plant, and the harried managers struggled to organize the production to fill them.
[11:20:01] <quanticle> Workers from other departments would come and bother line workers until they got a specific part they were waiting on. The solution was to force every other department to submit elaborate forms detailing the parts they needed. The seven managers grew to an army of 47 clerks that processed the paperwork to determine material needs and create optimized production schedules. Performance at the
[11:20:03] <quanticle> brass works improved and lowered the cost of a new rail car enough to offset the cost of the extra employees many times."

[11:27:35] <quanticle> feep[work]: So here's the thing. Socialism is the "natural" way of resolving these intra-firm disputes, but I was pondering and I don't know why capitalism *wouldn't* solve the problem here
[11:27:43] <quanticle> Like, give each department money
[11:27:48] <quanticle> Let them bid for brass fittings
[11:28:09] <feep[work]> that'd get a bit complex to set up
[11:28:24] <feep[work]> since you need to dispense the money somehow based on the global criterion you want to optimize
[11:28:37] <quanticle> More complex than hiring 47 clerks and forcing everyone to submit extremely detailed forms in triplicate about what brass fittings they needed when?
[11:28:46] <feep[work]> and also, the whole point of money is integrating hidden knowledge, and in this case there is no hidden knowledge, or if there is, you have bigger problems
[11:29:02] <feep[work]> I mean, I admit the forms are stupid. :p
[11:29:17] <quanticle> Yeah, I guess we're just reinventing Coase's theory of the firm
[11:29:26] <feep[work]> but like, I am betting brass fittings delivery contracts will not exactly look much simpler
[11:29:43] <quanticle> That is in this case if you did it my way your transaction costs would overwhelm any benefits in coordination you got from setting up the market or something

[11:31:22] <feep[work]> anyway, I think what is happening is, elon actually has a sketchy idea of the whole process of the entire company, and he goes around and asks "explain me how your low-level part fits into the whole"
[11:31:30] <feep[work]> and doing so forces the dispersion of the task plan through the hierarchy
[11:32:02] <feep[work]> because individual workers need to know both what they are doing and why, or else risk disappointing elon
[11:32:36] <feep[work]> and this allows finegrained low-process optimization by avoiding the siloization of planning in the manager levels
[11:32:45] <feep[work]> low-level process*
[11:33:31] <feep[work]> and also if someone explained "well, we'd be doing X but we are being held up by busywork from Y" you can bet that elon would go to Y next
[11:33:51] <feep[work]> and *also* the man knows enough that he's pretty hard to bullshit?

[12:01:04] <saturn2> if you're the type of programmer that gets hired from HN threads, it doesn't really matter what's going on with some schlub working for wells fargo
[12:01:28] <quanticle> Yeah, but this was in the context of the _Economist_ article
[12:01:42] <quanticle> And they were claiming that this reflective of the broader software job market
[12:01:49] <Obormot\Gaia> rmmh: Yo dawg ...
[12:01:59] <saturn2> there probably isn't much crossover between the two, either

[12:02:02] <quanticle> And my counterclaim is that HN Who Is Hiring thread are not representative
[12:02:09] <ggreer> also I love the energy of the workers
[12:02:30] <saturn2> so there's not really such a thing as "the" software job market
[12:02:53] <quanticle> Well, sure, I'll accept that point, but it also invalidates the article
[12:03:03] <saturn2> yes
[12:03:19] <quanticle> The article doesn't say, "Small startups on the West Coast are increasingly going remote," it's saying that software jobs are going remote
[12:04:14] <Obormot\Gaia> So I'm reading another one of those stories in that collection, a Greg Egan one
[12:04:21] <Obormot\Gaia> It's from 2019? And it talks about Skyping people
[12:04:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Which is already obsolete-sounding
[12:05:15] <quanticle> I will admit, despite having owned that collection since almost the month it debuted, I think I've only read the Peter Watts story
[12:05:36] <quanticle> Or at least, "Cycloptera" is the only one that made any kind of impression on me
[12:05:58] <quanticle> I guess there's another one that I vaguely remember about someone being stuck on the moon or whatever.
[12:06:49] <quanticle> *Cyclopterus
[12:08:20] <Obormot\Gaia> That's the one I'm reading
[12:08:30] <Obormot\Gaia> So, no spoilers
[12:08:40] <Obormot\Gaia> But also I guess that means it wasn't very memorable... :p
[12:10:41] <quanticle> But that said, Cyclopterus is a good enough story that I don't regret the purchase
[12:11:21] <nshepperd2> software jobs are going remote in much the same sense that people are doing innovative goat yoga

[12:13:40] <quanticle> I haven't heard about goat yoga in *years*
[12:13:53] <nshepperd2> "skype" was in great danger of becoming a genericized synonym for "video chat", but then they successfully became irrelevant and now i don't know anyone who even uses skype
[12:14:04] <quanticle> dv^_^: I go into the office because we have giant screens and nice microphones in our conference rooms
[12:14:47] <quanticle> nshepperd2: I remember reading an article where some mom used "Skyped" as a verb

[12:15:29] <Gurkenglas> Suppose the Fed must burn more money than it has. What's the plan? Short sell US Treasuries? Gamble with other countries in order to either acquire enough money to burn to stabilize, or lose enough money to undergo foreign takeover?

[12:16:30] <Gurkenglas> *gasp* an emergency tax?
[12:16:30] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: don't do anything and just cope with it
[12:19:13] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, suppose that it needs 1T€'s worth of dollars to burn, and that if it keeps printing and using dollars the limit of € it can buy is 5T. Is a 1/6 chance of total dollarruptcy worse than a certainty of targeting failure?
[12:19:21] <PlanckWalk> First, make lots of money.  Then, burn it.
[12:20:11] <Obormot\Gaia> Ok, yeah, that story was meh
[12:20:25] <nshepperd2> why does it 'need' to burn 1 a trillion dollars?
[12:20:41] <nshepperd2> just stop printing money for a while
[12:20:53] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, in order to prevent inflation. Suppose it stops printing money entirely and inflation keeps happening.
[12:21:02] <Gurkenglas> Too much of it.
[12:21:21] <Obormot\Gaia> "An unspecified apocalypse is happening! Anyway, let's talk about orbital mechanics"
[12:21:34] <Obormot\Gaia> Greg Egan, man
[12:21:46] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: i don't believe in that happening
[12:22:24] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, i dont know why this keeps happening, i ask hypotheticals to test a theory and the hypothetical is denied
[12:23:03] <Gurkenglas> Maybe it helps if I posit it happening to some other country that's trying to do that cool Fed thing?
[12:24:56] <nshepperd2> my impression is that when hyperinflation has happened irl it's mainly been because the central bank kept printing money (in order to keep up with inflation)
[12:25:04] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: Okay, but why would inflation keep happening if the central bank stopped buying government bonds for cash?
[12:25:29] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, why does inflation happen ever in the absence of a central bank?
[12:25:34] <quanticle> It doesn't?
[12:25:57] <quanticle> Like... there are times where there are genuine increases in the amount of money (like when gold was discovered in California)
[12:26:08] <quanticle> And there was inflation in Spain when they discovered gold in the Americas
[12:26:14] <quanticle> But other than that, it doesn't happen
[12:26:53] <Gurkenglas> suppose everyone learns coding and starts getting paid huge cash; they deposit it in the banks and allow them to loan most of it to others; the flow of money increases a lot without any new bills
[12:27:06] <nshepperd2> the people in charge like madura blame others, but that's just them being evil and stupid
[12:27:13] <nshepperd2> maduro
[12:27:15] <quanticle> Hold on, in the absence of a central bank making cash, where does that "huge cash" come from?
[12:27:50] <Gurkenglas> from the startups that are getting credit from the banks
[12:28:13] <Gurkenglas> its a circle
[12:29:01] <cpopell> you mean in a 0% reserve environment?
[12:29:26] <Gurkenglas> maybe that, maybe a 5% reserve environment
[12:29:26] <quanticle> Okay, but eventually what happens is that, without a central bank, the commercial banks overlend and fail
[12:29:34] <quanticle> Like, eventually people do ask for their gold back
[12:29:39] <quanticle> And when you can't give it to them
[12:29:41] <quanticle> there's a bank run
[12:29:44] <quanticle> And economic collapse
[12:29:58] <quanticle> This is basically the entire US economy in the 1800s
[12:30:12] <quanticle> Booms followed by busts
[12:30:18] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, suppose reddit figures out what memetic effects cause this to happen and start getting paid good money by the banks to keep this from happening
[12:30:28] <quanticle> Then you don't have inflation!
[12:30:38] <quanticle> Because the banks only lend as much money as they have
[12:30:42] <cpopell> also you just reinvented the fed, kind of
[12:30:50] <cpopell> (in a very roundabout way)
[12:30:54] <quanticle> No, he's invented full reserve banking
[12:31:10] <Gurkenglas> the memetic thing that's prevented here is everyone taking their money out at once
[12:31:13] <cpopell> ^
[12:31:30] <cpopell> I don't think it's memes, necessarily
[12:31:38] <cpopell> there are lots of situations where bank runs are rational
[12:33:17] <Gurkenglas> yeah, and reddit manages to make it so the information that would lead everyone to run the bank doesn't spread through the whole population; and everyone knows that reddit does this sort of thing; and everyone's okay with it because they have money in the bank.
[12:33:57] <quanticle> But what happens when one person *does* need the money
[12:34:03] <quanticle> Because of exogenous circumstances
[12:34:12] <Gurkenglas> then you give the money to that one person; you do have some money
[12:34:16] <quanticle> I have a car accident and I need the money to buy a new car
[12:34:31] <quanticle> Okay, but statistically, at some point, you're going to have something like a natural disaster
[12:34:39] <quanticle> Or a major episode of fraud
[12:34:48] <quanticle> And *lots* of people are going to ask for their reserve funds
[12:35:04] <quanticle> And then, in the absence of a lender of last resort, you have a bank failure
[12:35:40] <quanticle> And this failure cascades, because banks lend to other banks
[12:36:24] <quanticle> Yes, you can do things like impose capital controls and bank holidays
[12:36:30] <quanticle> But in the limit case? That's just Communism
[12:37:10] <quanticle> Where the government says, "It's not your money, but we'll let you have as much money as you need right now in order to meet your daily needs"
[12:37:25] <Gurkenglas> How about this: Instead of depositing their money with the understanding they can take it out, they deposit it with the understanding that they get half the proceeds of the loans the bank then makes
[12:37:47] <quanticle> That's just a money market fund
[12:37:52] <quanticle> I can do that right now
[12:37:54] <quanticle> Lots of people do that
[12:38:06] <Gurkenglas> sure, lets say ~everyone does that
[12:38:08] <cpopell> you get a lot more than half with a mmf
[12:38:17] <quanticle> And again, you run into the same problem. Eventually the fund makes some bad loans and "breaks the buck"
[12:38:33] <quanticle> The Federal Reserve had to bail out money market funds in 2008
[12:39:11] <quanticle> Even though, in theory, people should have known that the fund was not FDIC insured
[12:39:17] <cpopell> (Constraints on MMFs: assets have to be <13 months old, average age of assets have to be <90 days, can't put more than 5% in any one company, 95% of it has to be in AAA or better assets, 100% in AA or better)
[12:39:19] <cpopell> I think
[12:39:21] <quanticle> And they had "no expectation" of getting their full money back
[12:39:23] <cpopell> ....I've been studying
[12:39:27] <Gurkenglas> I don't quite follow. the mmf issues a loan and the money fails to get paid back. then whoever invested in that mmf loses some money, of course.
[12:39:48] <Gurkenglas> why does it get a bailout
[12:40:06] <quanticle> In theory. In practice? If the fund is big enough, then a failure of the fund can have catastrophic enough effects on downstream businesses that it's in the central bank's interest to bail out the fund
[12:40:14] <quanticle> Like, why do banks get bailouts?
[12:40:24] <cpopell> and depending who you ask that's either because fat cat bankers have things catered to them
[12:40:27] <cpopell> or to prevent social meltdown
[12:40:29] <quanticle> Why do we even have deposit insurance?

[12:41:24] <feep[work]> did they check their heads for mushrooms
[12:41:35] <quanticle> rmmh: cc gwern
[12:41:51] <Gurkenglas> Suppose a country has its shit together for some years and forces mmfs to make unrisky enough investments they need no bailing out
[12:42:16] <cpopell> MMFs are already in incredibly unrisky investments
[12:42:22] <cpopell> assuming the system is working as specified
[12:42:29] <quanticle> Then you don't have any inflation because the MMFs are incredibly conservative
[12:42:35] <quanticle> And make correspondingly low rates of return
[12:42:43] <quanticle> Trending to zero over the long run
[12:42:54] <ggreer> rmmh: damn what did they do to piss off that train so much?
[12:42:59] <quanticle> The long term risk free rate of return is zero
[12:43:26] <cpopell> APY for MMFs is ~.5%
[12:43:57] <rmmh> ggreer: probably called it heavy or something
[12:44:07] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, suppose i buy some invincible superseeds and wait a year and harvest them and sell, and the prices involved have been stable for decades. are you saying that this makes no profit?
[12:44:09] <quanticle> Yeah, I was looking into MMFs for some non-profit money that my mom wanted to stash. I told her that she would literally get higher rates of return from some FDIC insured savings banks
[12:44:21] <Gurkenglas> because the land prices etc cancel everything out?
[12:44:26] <ggreer> sensible_chuckle.gif
[12:44:36] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: You don't have invincible superseeds
[12:44:55] <quanticle> Your seeds have the risk of crop failure
[12:45:11] <ggreer> https://i.imgur.com/woJoqMN.gif for those who don't know
[12:45:12] <Gurkenglas> I seem to be getting motte-and-bailey'd. This system seems to have assumptions that we can't assume to keep holding.
[12:45:30] <Gurkenglas> if mmfs dont have these properties i have in mind then apparently i wasnt thinking of an mmf
[12:45:30] <quanticle> Why not? The history of financial systems is *rife* with crop failures causing bank failures
[12:46:01] <nshepperd2> anyway if the fed is unsatisfied with how much fractional reserve banking is happening, i guess they could pass a law increasing the minimum reserve
[12:46:08] <quanticle> Which they do
[12:46:16] <quanticle> Or they did after the last recession
[12:46:22] <quanticle> Minimum reserve requirements were increased
[12:46:49] <quanticle> But then they lent banks the money to meet the requirement
[12:46:50] <cpopell> okay, so a MMF takes your money and invests it in very safe investments. In general, 1 share of a MMF is worth 1 dollar.
[12:46:56] <cpopell> The investments have the properties I mentioned above
[12:47:12] <cpopell> what properties do the financial instrument you're thinking of have?
[12:48:22] <nshepperd2> quanticle: makes sense to me. you lend them money to let them meet the requirement (because *their* loans won't come in instantly), then anyone who doesn't have enough reserve when the loan is due is executed
[12:49:19] <Gurkenglas> cpopell, you mean, you accept the hypothetical premise and ask for my hypothetical conclusion? :)
[12:52:00] <cpopell> I don't know what I'm accepting
[12:52:48] <Gurkenglas> i think i want the properties you were laying out - whether the investments are safe was getting challenged, but not by you - so i think we're fine on this point
[12:53:15] <nshepperd2> cpopell says as he blindly signs the clipboard
[12:53:27] <cpopell> I mean, the properties I laid out
[12:53:29] <cpopell> are the mmf ones
[12:53:35] <cpopell> there's a lot more to it that I don't know
[12:54:00] <Gurkenglas> cpopell, bananaland outlaws banks and everyone puts their money in a bananaland-focused mmf. It loans money to the certified-safe-by-experts computer megafactory. it can thus hire increasing amounts of the population at double the wage. Those people put the surplus in mmfs and the money goes in a circle
[12:54:50] <quanticle> >hire increasing amounts of population at double the wage
[12:54:53] <quanticle> It cannot
[12:55:03] <quanticle> Because where is it going to get the money
[12:55:06] <Gurkenglas> the loans!
[12:55:09] <Gurkenglas> from the mmf
[12:55:20] <quanticle> Okay, but the MMF gets its money from the people
[12:55:25] <quanticle> Who have a fixed supply of money
[12:55:35] *** Quits: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[12:55:43] <Gurkenglas> the money goes around in a circle, that the total amount is fixed does not constrain this flow
[12:55:45] <quanticle> Okay, let's get real hypothetical
[12:55:54] <quanticle> Let's assume we have a hundred gold coins
[12:55:58] *** Joins: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm)
[12:55:59] <quanticle> That's our entire monetary supply
[12:56:02] <Gurkenglas> yep
[12:56:18] <quanticle> What you've proposed is a situation where everyone is promised 2x their previous savings
[12:56:24] <quanticle> So 200 gold coins
[12:56:40] <Gurkenglas> yep
[12:56:44] <quanticle> And you're saying that you can promise 200 gold coins against a total supply of 100 gold coins
[12:56:46] <quanticle> Indefinitely
[12:57:45] <Gurkenglas> The mmf money can, of course, not be taken out (though you might sell your contract to someone else, if anyone will buy it)
[12:58:06] <Gurkenglas> just the same as a bank cant suddenly ask for the loan back
[12:58:07] <quanticle> Okay, but by what mechanism?
[12:58:12] <quanticle> What prevents me?
[12:58:25] <nshepperd2> Debasing Gold With Nickel And Other Fun Projects For Kids
[12:58:41] <Gurkenglas> the contract you signed. you gave the mmf a loan, you get it back at the same rate as the factory pays the loan.
[12:58:48] <quanticle> Okay, but what if I don't?
[12:59:00] <quanticle> What if I just take the money and stash it in my house
[12:59:09] <quanticle> And don't put my money back in the MMF
[12:59:13] <Gurkenglas> Then your money doesnt go into the circle, yep
[12:59:28] <quanticle> And what if more and more people do this, because they need liquidity?
[12:59:55] <Gurkenglas> If a constant 5% of the money gets stashed away each cycle, the 100 coins can only become ~2000 virtual coins
[13:00:58] <Gurkenglas> If after 5 months aka 5 cycles, people start needing money (because prices seem to be going up *gasp*), they stop cycling the money, but this doesnt reduce the virtual coins already there
[13:01:57] <quanticle> No, why would prices be going up? I haven't talked about inflation at all. I'm just talking about, what happens when *someone* crunches the numbers and says, "Hey, wait fuckin' minute. There are only 100 coins in the MMF and they have total obligations of 200 coins!"
[13:02:01] <Gurkenglas> the factory stops hiring additional people but it does sell computers at a steady rate so it can keep paying its workers
[13:02:13] <quanticle> To whom is it selling the computers?
[13:02:23] <quanticle> This is a closed economy, remember
[13:03:41] <Gurkenglas> You open up a computer and you notice there's no cpu inside, just opium. The expert who certified the safety of this investment clearly knew the whole time.
[13:04:34] <quanticle> I'm just wondering how this doesn't end up in a bank run, when people stop rolling their loans over
[13:04:39] <quanticle> Like, if I had ten coins
[13:04:55] <quanticle> and I lent them to the MMFs with the expectation that it would pay me back in a year
[13:05:04] <quanticle> Okay, in a year's time either it pays me the coins or it doesn't
[13:05:39] <quanticle> And if it pays me back 12 coins, say, because of interest, where did the additional two coins come from?
[13:05:52] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: you've got your idea of money backwards, people don't start out with money and deposit it in banks, banks create money and lend it to people
[13:05:59] <feep[work]> I mean
[13:06:03] <feep[work]> people *could* start out with money
[13:06:10] <feep[work]> that's how ubi works
[13:06:31] <nshepperd2> don't people dig money out of the ground
[13:06:45] <quanticle> No, the UBI is that the banks create money and give it to people with no expectation of the people returning it
[13:06:52] <nshepperd2> then you go to the blacksmith and get it shaped into a likeness of the king
[13:06:57] <feep[work]> um, this all depends on how you implement the money
[13:06:59] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, suppose the factory is 99% likely to pay its loan to the mmi back 1.2fold. ie to the holder of the mmf
[13:07:17] <feep[work]> if banks "create money and give it to the people", this is not in fact logically distinguishable from the people just having the money.
[13:07:33] <feep[work]> the banks don't *do* anything in this scenario.
[13:07:38] <saturn2> scientists discovered that it's not necessary to dig gold out of the ground in order to use it as money
[13:07:39] <dbohdan> feep[work]: I like https://i.imgur.com/HLL5hfq.png
[13:07:41] <feep[work]> there's no consideration, no computation.
[13:07:47] <feep[work]> dbohdan: yeah :)
[13:08:07] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: How?! Closed economy, remember. If the factory got a loan of 100 gold coins, and agreed to pay back 120 gold coins in a year's time... where did the additional twenty coins come from?
[13:08:29] <nshepperd2> saturn2: but it doesn't taste as good :(
[13:08:29] <saturn2> from the bank
[13:09:17] <quanticle> saturn2: Right, but what I'm saying is that eventually the bank runs into a situation where there are more people demanding money of it than it has in reserves
[13:09:19] <quanticle> And it collapses
[13:09:24] <quanticle> And the economy deflates
[13:09:51] <saturn2> oh
[13:10:37] <quanticle> Like, this is how economies were. This is the "real business cycle"
[13:10:40] <Gurkenglas> 1. it hires 100 workers for 1 coin each; it produces 120 units of opium, worth 1 coin each; it sells them to the population 1 unit at a time, repaying 1 coin of the loan at a time.
[13:10:51] <Gurkenglas> (uh forgot the numbering after 1. there :) )
[13:11:04] <quanticle> You're assuming that when the bank repays the loan, I roll it over
[13:11:10] <quanticle> What happens if I just take my money?
[13:11:14] <quanticle> And hoard it
[13:11:25] <Gurkenglas> instead of buying opium? good luck
[13:11:44] <quanticle> Right, so you're implying there's a force that *makes* me give the money back
[13:11:51] <Gurkenglas> but sure, in the 1% that the factory fails to sell its opium, it fails to pay the loan
[13:12:01] <quanticle> Yeah, and the economy collapses
[13:12:29] <quanticle> And prices go down as everyone realizes that hey, there are actually only 100 units of currency in this economy
[13:12:30] <Gurkenglas> in that 1%, the people that held the mmf gain no money. what is this collapse you talk about? the 100 coins are still there
[13:12:53] <Gurkenglas> oh yeah, the prices sure go back to normal when the mmf fails.
[13:12:58] <quanticle> Right
[13:13:33] <quanticle> So no inflation over the long run
[13:13:54] <quanticle> It's a shitty economy, but it has no inflation
[13:13:55] <Gurkenglas> yes inflation over the long run: 99% of 120% is expected up
[13:14:39] * nshepperd2 dubious
[13:14:56] <Gurkenglas> correction: multiplying by 1.2 99 times and by 0 once wipes you out
[13:15:30] <Gurkenglas> lets say the 1% makes it so the factory returns .5 instead of 1.2
[13:16:15] <quanticle> No, the 1% does *not* make it
[13:16:28] <quanticle> Like, remember their gains are offset by the losses of everyone else
[13:16:46] <quanticle> If everyone starts out with ten coins, and I end up with twelve (because I pulled out early)
[13:16:52] <quanticle> Then someone else ended up with eight
[13:16:54] <saturn2> what if there was just one big gold coin that everyone held a fraction of
[13:16:56] <quanticle> Because they stayed in too long
[13:17:17] <Gurkenglas> In fact, lets simplify this stupid far to clarify the disagreement
[13:17:20] <Gurkenglas> There is one coin.
[13:17:24] <Gurkenglas> I hold it.
[13:17:49] <nshepperd2> you are allowed to touch the coin for a certain amount of time each day in order to absorb its magical essence
[13:18:06] <Gurkenglas> I ("buy an MMF") loan you a coin in return for a promised two coins.
[13:18:35] <Gurkenglas> You buy a chocolate rectangle from me for the coin.
[13:18:53] <Gurkenglas> You split it into 3 smaller rectangles, a trick you thought of yesterday
[13:19:16] <Gurkenglas> you sell me a rectangle for one coin, you pay back half your loan, you sell me the other rectangle, you pay back the other half
[13:20:17] <Gurkenglas> I am happy because i think i have more than i used to, as a result of issuing this loan
[13:20:19] <otoburb> I'm confused. There is only one coin (that you held), which you loaned to me (I have the coin). There is no other hard currency available to make this thought exercise work? 
[13:20:42] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: You're happy as long as you never call in the loan
[13:20:47] <quanticle> Because when you do
[13:20:50] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, the loan has been paid back!
[13:20:57] <quanticle> No it hasn't
[13:21:04] <saturn2> for that to work, the coin has to always keep moving around faster and faster
[13:21:08] <quanticle> The interest has been paid
[13:21:12] <quanticle> But not the principal
[13:21:45] *** Quits: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[13:21:51] <Gurkenglas> i and you a children and dont know these words. what we agreed on was a "loan": i give you a coin, you twice later have to give me a coin.
[13:22:06] <saturn2> otoburb: the one coin can be spent multiple times by the same person
[13:22:08] *** Joins: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm)
[13:23:02] <nshepperd2> don't you get executed by the fed at step 2 for being 0 reserve
[13:23:39] <cpopell> reserve rate now is 0-.25%
[13:23:56] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: Yes, twice later
[13:24:00] <quanticle> But I only gave you a coin once
[13:24:01] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, you told mom about this plan and she okayd it. she even certified that you will fulfill the loan, because she knows the three chocolate trades would be accepted.
[13:25:21] <saturn2> there's no way to guarantee the coin will get spent again fast enough to repay the loan in time
[13:25:36] <quanticle> Like, if I owe you two coins, then you pass the coin back to me after I give you back the one coin, either you have increased the value of the loan (to three coins) or you have taken a loss by giving me the coin
[13:26:09] <Gurkenglas> this is getting funny, i dont know where the miscommunication is:
[13:26:14] <nshepperd> quanticle: no, the coin was foolishly exchanged for a third of a bar of chocolate
[13:26:29] <quanticle> Okay, so I ate the chocolate
[13:26:30] <nshepperd> so the latter
[13:26:32] <quanticle> Now what
[13:26:34] <Gurkenglas> i give you coin. you buy my chocolate. you split chocolate. i buy your 1 chocolate. you pay half the loan. i buy your 2nd chocolate. you pay the other half of the loan
[13:26:48] <quanticle> I pay half a coin
[13:26:54] <quanticle> and then I pay another half a coin?
[13:26:57] <quanticle> But you still have one coin then
[13:27:02] <quanticle> Where are you getting two coins
[13:27:05] <Gurkenglas> ...
[13:27:07] <nshepperd> no a whole coin
[13:27:17] <Gurkenglas> again, with less definitions
[13:27:50] <saturn2> what if instead of buying the 2nd chocolate you decide to buy a flower, and the florist doesn't need to buy anything so he puts the coin in a safe
[13:27:54] <otoburb> If this channel can't figure this out, Main Street has no chance
[13:28:04] <Gurkenglas> i give you coin for promise of twice "you give me coin". you buy my chocolate. you split chocolate. i buy 1st chocolate. you fulfill 1st promise. i buy 2nd chocolate. you fulfill 2nd promise.
[13:28:15] <saturn2> then the economy is over
[13:28:20] <quanticle> otoburb: No, on the contrary Gurkenglas is the reason Wall Street can't figure it out
[13:28:54] <quanticle> You buy first chocolate, and then I give you the coin
[13:28:58] <quanticle> Then I have no more coins to give
[13:29:23] <quanticle> Unless you lend me the coin again
[13:29:28] <quanticle> At which point we have another loan
[13:29:34] <quanticle> Or an increase in the value of the first loan
[13:29:46] <nshepperd> no, they just buy the second chocolate
[13:29:49] <quanticle> With what?
[13:30:01] <nshepperd> with the coin you just gave them
[13:30:21] <quanticle> Okay, let's go back. Who has the coin and who has the chocolate? 
[13:30:24] <quanticle> A has the coin
[13:30:25] <nshepperd> lol
[13:30:27] <quanticle> B has chocolate
[13:30:29] <Gurkenglas> ill draw an animation
[13:30:33] <quanticle> A gives the coin to B
[13:30:44] <quanticle> And B promises two coins in return
[13:30:51] <quanticle> Then what?
[13:30:54] <nshepperd> A has both coin and chocolate
[13:31:10] <quanticle> Okay, A has both coin and chocolate
[13:31:14] <nshepperd> A lends coin to B in exchange for promise of 2x coin
[13:31:18] <quanticle> Right
[13:31:25] <nshepperd> B buys chocolate
[13:31:28] <quanticle> B gives coin to A in return for chocolate
[13:31:41] <quanticle> Then A has both coin and .5 chocolate
[13:32:04] <quanticle> Now and B has .5 chocolate
[13:32:07] <quanticle> Now what
[13:32:11] <nshepperd> where did .5 come from
[13:32:26] <quanticle> B took half the chocolate from A right?
[13:32:31] <nshepperd> no, all of it
[13:32:45] <quanticle> Okay, so now A has coin B has chocolate
[13:32:52] <quanticle> But A also has a promise of a second coin
[13:33:00] <quanticle> Which comes from... where?
[13:33:11] <nshepperd> A has coin and promise of 2 coins
[13:33:19] <saturn2> the idea is supposed to be that you can use chocolate to make more chocolate
[13:33:44] <saturn2> chocolate is capital goods
[13:33:48] <quanticle> Right, but that doesn't increase the amount of coins. It just makes the coin more valuable
[13:34:02] <nshepperd> B breaks chocolate into 3 chocolates, A is stupid and buys 2 of the 3 parts for 1 coin each
[13:34:18] <quanticle> nshepperd: In that case, A took a loss
[13:34:22] <nshepperd> yep
[13:34:55] <saturn2> can we do 0.999=1 next
[13:35:08] <quanticle> Heh
[13:35:09] <nshepperd> you can also imagine B using these banach tarski theorem to literally turn the chocolate into 3 chocolates, in which case it wouldn't be a loss
[13:35:36] <nshepperd> i don't really see what this has to do with anything though
[13:35:43] <quanticle> Sure, and I guess in this incredibly abstract hypothetical spherical cow scenario, the Banach-Tarski axiom of choice is a valid dodge
[13:36:10] <nshepperd> or maybe in this universe bars of chocolate grow into chocolate trees

[13:38:13] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: Your animation confuses matters more than it clarifies them
[13:38:34] <Gurkenglas> Because instead of things moving, they are erased and redrawn? hmm.
[13:40:04] <quanticle> Also it's way too fast
[13:40:22] <nshepperd2> i guess the point is that after the chocolate has been sold, A has a coin and a promise of two coins, which is sort of like having 3 coins
[13:40:30] <nshepperd2> and that's fractional reserve banking
[13:40:50] <nshepperd2> aka M2 or whichever one it is
[13:41:33] *** Joins: Matthias1 (~Matthias1@cpe-76-170-236-166.socal.res.rr.com)
[13:42:28] <nshepperd2> but i don't think the number of imaginary coins can grow infinitely unless you have no reserve minimum
[13:42:31] <Gurkenglas> Okay, so the Fed notices that people are making promises to each other and this is sort of like printing money but harder to outlaw, so prices seem to be going up, and the Fed has run out of pocket money to burn. What's the plan? Taxes, gambling, short selling?
[13:43:05] <nshepperd2> and even if you have no minimum, a bank run happens way before you have 10,000 imaginary coins and still only 100 real ones
[13:43:06] <quanticle> No, the fed can shrink the money supply
[13:43:15] <nshepperd2> so you can't have long term inflation
[13:43:29] <quanticle> Yeah, like eventually people notice

[13:48:07] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[13:48:31] <otoburb> All I see is balance sheets expanding with fake/virtual coins
[13:50:29] <quanticle> otoburb: Yep, until someone actually asks for the coins
[13:50:42] <quanticle> Or asks for the virtual coins to be reified
[13:50:46] <quanticle> And then you have a collapse
[13:50:52] <otoburb> Right -- then it's a traditional bank run. 
[13:51:04] <quanticle> Yep, and that deflates the economy
[13:51:17] <Gurkenglas> So if all else fails, the Fed promises that for each dollar you give it to burn today, itll print you 2 dollars in a year; prices stabilize for a few months because people take the Fed's offer instead of buying high-priced luxury goods; a finite number of years down the fed promises *infinite* money tomorrow for a dollar today and people don't care; and then the dollar dies.
[13:51:18] <otoburb> Although, if we all move to CBDCs, then the Fed can sidestep that part. 
[13:51:43] <quanticle> Well, the fed can sidestep that part right now
[13:51:54] <quanticle> By reducing interest rates and, if that fails, with quantitative easing
[13:52:00] <quanticle> Where they just buy loans from banks
[13:52:11] <quanticle> And hold consumer loans directly
[13:52:41] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[13:52:41] <quanticle> And the bank now, instead of having a dodgy loan on its balance sheet which it has to write down, has a bunch of cash which it can theoretically lend
[13:54:02] <otoburb> Banks have an insane amount of cash (actually, I believe they're bank reserves, not the cash that we're used to). So much that they're taking advantage of the Fed's reverse repurchase facility in record amounts. 
[13:54:35] <otoburb> Bank A: "I have all these bank reserves you printed out of thin air -- here, take them all and give me your T-bills!"
[13:58:18] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: I think you meant to say that the Treasury promises to give you back more dollars in the future (Treasury bills/notes/bonds debt), not the FEd
[13:59:24] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, whichever of the two has the ability by the definition of the dollar to print dollars
[14:00:18] <otoburb> Treasury can issue debt against tax revenues; Fed can print/create bank reserves. Fed likes to buy Treasury debt as part of the "printing" exercise from my very limited layperson's understanding here. 
[14:00:46] <nshepperd> i-it's not like i want you to borrow my money or anything, baka
[14:01:06] <Gurkenglas> It makes sense that the dollar's definition would include that the Fed must only spend the money it prints at market rate.
[14:01:22] <otoburb> That's the crazy part ... the Fed is the lender of last resort, but can't push on a string (i.e. force people to borrow). 
[14:04:35] <otoburb> Since stimulus checks are mailed directly to people, and they're likely depositing them straight into bank accounts, and IF that money is being used to pay down outstanding consumer loans/debt, then the government is actually hastening deflation
[14:04:57] <otoburb> Notwithstanding the very real goods & services price increases that are being felt across the board
[14:05:58] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, deflation=currency becoming rarer, why would that happen as a result of consumer loans being repaid
[14:06:09] <kuudes> I think you guys have an error with the not said out expectations
[14:06:29] <kuudes> basicly Gurkenglas position can be solved by not allowing people to withdraw their savings but at the term, I think
[14:06:50] <kuudes> and quanticle's position can be solved by <0% interest, ie price on holding your money
[14:07:27] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: When loans are created, provided we're not worrying about the underlying hard currency (i.e. our fractional-reserve banking system), I thought that dollars are "created" whenever a loan is outstanding.
[14:07:59] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, by my position being solved you mean that nothing could collapse if withdraw isnt an option? i agree, i said this, and the possibility of collapse is in the end irrelevant to my question anyway i think :3

[14:10:00] <kuudes> also quanticle ^
[14:10:17] <quanticle> kuudes: Awesome
[14:10:17] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, oh you mean promises being bad creates currency and promises being fulfilled deletes it again and the stimulus check came from tax money instead of fed printing, and thus deflation
[14:11:17] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, by <0% you mean that the fraction of reserve money that banks have to keep would be declared to evaporate over time?
[14:11:19] <otoburb> ... deflation only if people are extinguishing loans (paying them down). If people are using their stimulus checks for YOLO investments, then I'm not sure whether that's deflationary in the end
[14:11:42] <otoburb> I guess if people are using their stimulus checks to qualify for riskier loans, then that would be inflationary :D
[14:12:03] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, <0% interest on savings means if you deposit 100 to bank, you can only withdraw 99 etc
[14:12:24] <kuudes> ie there is price you pay for renting the storage room where your money remains untouched
[14:12:36] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, so instead of a stimulus check, what if the government subsidizes consumer loans
[14:13:40] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: What does "subsidize" mean? If it means "help pay down loans" then that sounds deflationary to me. 
[14:14:17] <otoburb> But if it means "pause payments", then that sounds dis-inflationary but not entirely deflationary
[14:14:38] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, no, no, help you take loans. for every consumer loan the bank gives you, it immediately gets 1 shiny gold coin
[14:14:54] <quanticle> Oh, that's inflationary
[14:15:00] <otoburb> Inflationary
[14:15:47] <Gurkenglas> Okay, so you could switch from stimulus checks to that if you wanted to stimulate. Is that the most stimulatory intervention you can do?
[14:15:50] <otoburb> I mean, that's kind of the whole point of the Fed shoring up bank reserves; to try to stimulate more lending. 
[14:17:41] <otoburb> As far as I understand, only commercial banks can really "create more dollars" via lending/loans; they're the source of loans like mortgages, credit cards and other loans (auto/credit).  But if nobody wants to take out more credit during a pandemic, then there's no inflationary pressure happening from that angle. 
[14:18:21] <otoburb> Where inflation in my simplistic worldview is "more dollars chasing goods & services".
[14:21:24] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: I think it's the other way around; Treasury and Fed tried to increase bank reserves praying that more loans would be created, but that didn't happen during 2020. So, they switched to outright fiscal stimulus. 
[14:21:31] <Gurkenglas> buying the S&P 500 with printed money to cause inflation has the problem that it drives up those prices more than other prices, right? and is therefore sorta gifting money to those shareholders
[14:23:18] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, the advantage of outright fiscal stimulus over subsidizing consumer loans is that it works even on grandpa who lives under a rock?
[14:23:29] <otoburb> If people have more money (stimulus checks, shit even loans assuming they're comfortable enough to apply with crazy low interest rates), and if that money goes into the stock market, then yeah -- you'll get asset inflation. 
[14:24:16] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: I don't think anybody knows to be honest, but it seems like it's a faster mechanism to try to get grandpa to spend more quickly and stimulate/inflate the economy. 
[14:24:50] <otoburb> Versus giving money (i.e. banking reserves) to commercial banks and hoping they will push lending, and simultaneously hoping that consumers/businesses will apply for loans
[14:27:39] <otoburb> Where I get confused myself is that corporate debt is at an all time high, as is the US trade deficit and the actual debt that continues to pile up. So, it would actually be in Treasury's best interest to inflate away the debt. 
[14:28:29] <Gurkenglas> instead of mailing everyone 1000$ you could mail them a voucher for a 1500$ one-year negative-interest consumer loan
[14:28:43] <otoburb> .... except if the Fed loses control over the long-end of the yield curve and rates rise too much, then Treasury's indebtedness will be impossible to service. 
[14:29:22] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, "inflate away the debt" <- deflate away the debt, right?
[14:29:30] <Gurkenglas> deleting debt deflates, we established
[14:32:08] <quanticle> No, inflate away the debt. Instead of canceling the debt
[14:32:11] <quanticle> You pay it back
[14:32:16] <quanticle> With money that you've printed
[14:32:59] <Gurkenglas> deleting debt was bad phrasing - what we established that fulfilling promises deflates (undoes the inflation created by anyone making promises to anyone)
[14:34:00] <saturn2> it reduces the amount of money in existence but doesn't necessarily change the price level
[14:34:01] <Gurkenglas> you print money, that makes inflation, you pay the debt, that reduces inflation. i think the latter effect is lesser, so inflate away debt, makes sense. Except that you're printing money and then gifting it away, that's not a good start
[14:34:07] <otoburb> From a monetary perspective, paying down loans is deflationary. On the flip side, if you're the government and you have a tonne of debt, what better way to pay it down than printing money out of thin air and paying it down that way. 
[14:34:27] <otoburb> Printing money is (usually) inflationary. 
[14:34:53] <otoburb> Because more dollars are chasing the same level of goods & services. 
[14:35:09] <Gurkenglas> ah if you pay down your own debt, that's of course balanced.
[14:35:48] <otoburb> There are basically a lot of cross-currents. We did'nt even talk about the appetite for dollars outside of the United States. 
[14:35:59] <Gurkenglas> Except that you're saying "government" so if the fed prints money and then *gifts* it to the government so it can pay back its debts, that's unbalanced again
[14:37:51] <otoburb> US Treasury issues debts (although technically that won't be possible if the ceiling isn't raised again). Fed manages the money supply. Yes -- if the Fed and Treasury continue on with this unholy alliance, then yeah -- the US can inflate all of its debt away gradually. 
[14:38:25] <Gurkenglas> but "fed prints money and donates it to the IRS" sounds like the sort of unbalanced operation whose warping effect seems predictable: it's precisely a wealth tax on dollars, wherever you try to hide your dollars
[14:39:16] <Gurkenglas> so shouldnt we use exactly this when we want to do a non-progressive wealth tax?
[14:40:33] <Gurkenglas> (and the government printing money to hyperinflation is precisely a 100% wealth tax - there just happened to be finite wealth)
[14:40:35] <feep[work]> 1. yes 2. this pushes people into other forms of wealth 3. piglovian taxation

[14:41:24] <feep[work]> I misremembered the name XD
[14:41:52] <Gurkenglas> 2. mission accomplished, you tried to get people to try and get rid of their dollars
[14:42:02] <saturn2> a dollar tax isn't really a wealth tax

[14:43:40] <feep[work]> or rather, wealth should under no circumstances be self-sustaining.
[14:43:49] <nshepperd> nah, wealth is good
[14:43:56] <feep[work]> if you have a lot of wealth, it should be because you are actively maintaining it with labor.
[14:44:04] <nshepperd> self sustaining wealth especially
[14:44:17] <feep[work]> I disagree, I think it's a bad substitute for ubi.
[14:44:26] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], but what if you earn more than you spend?
[14:44:37] <feep[work]> then you should have more, but not forever.
[14:44:46] <quanticle> Nah, fuck that, we should burn all wealth when people die, intergenerational wealth transfer is a disease upon society
[14:45:02] <nshepperd> people vastly underestimate the social value of giving wealth to other people to be productive with in exchange for getting more wealth back later
[14:45:07] <feep[work]> "when people die" cannot be cleanly implemented, so just do it progressive over time.
[14:45:17] <feep[work]> nshepperd: I think conversely, economists vastly overestimatei t.
[14:45:19] <feep[work]> e it*
[14:45:20] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], but what if you use a money in a way you benefit from forever
[14:45:23] <Gurkenglas> *the
[14:45:38] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: right, I don't think that should be possible.
[14:45:43] <nshepperd> the whole point of communism is people not even realising that this thing has value
[14:45:47] <saturn2> feep[work]: congratulations you just invented marxism
[14:45:53] <feep[work]> not even slightly
[14:45:59] <feep[work]> capitalism is great at optimizing production
[14:46:17] <feep[work]> it just has a bug where sometimes it goes unstable if you allow labor-less value accumulation
[14:46:44] <nshepperd> labor-less value accumulation is the important part!
[14:46:53] <feep[work]> to be clear, when I say wealth task, I mean like ... 0.1-0.2% a year
[14:46:54] <nshepperd> that's the part that optimises production
[14:46:59] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], like, what if someone uses the money to raise a child and then that child likes them forever
[14:47:02] <feep[work]> nshepperd: optimizing production is a kind of labor.
[14:47:12] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: then that child can give them some of their ubi.
[14:47:21] <Gurkenglas> so this is a forever-benefit
[14:47:31] <feep[work]> I mean, it's a forever benefit that the child can act on easily
[14:47:40] <otoburb> "labour-less value accumulation"; you mean, AGI or Brain Emulation? 
[14:47:43] <nshepperd> feep[work]: if you think that then you agree with me
[14:47:50] <feep[work]> otoburb: ems are people.
[14:48:05] <feep[work]> nshepperd: right, but I mean, the point is, investment should require labor
[14:48:17] <otoburb> My ems will be but shallow copies that will hardly qualify for the exalted status of "personhood". 
[14:48:24] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], so it's allowed to benefit forever from an investment so long as that investment has a soul that it could technically use to decide to stop benefitting you?
[14:48:38] <feep[work]> nshepperd: basically, I want the net value gain of vanguard world to be negative.
[14:49:05] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: yes.
[14:49:06] <otoburb> But then how will we ever fund UBI if Vanguard world goes to -ive? 
[14:49:10] <feep[work]> because souls are the source of value.
[14:49:24] <nshepperd> so, require people to dig a few ditches before anyone's allowed to borrow money from them?
[14:49:24] <feep[work]> otoburb: literally printing money
[14:49:59] <feep[work]> nshepperd: no you can borrow money, just ... like, the act of investing *without* picking who you invest in should be net negative.
[14:50:11] <nshepperd> but that's bad
[14:50:24] <feep[work]> no that's how we ensure that only people who actually add value gain value.
[14:50:27] <otoburb> I thought more importantly that active investing has been shown to be severely suboptimal on average. 
[14:50:40] <feep[work]> sure, but that's because it's anti-inductive
[14:50:46] <nshepperd> deferring your material wants to later because you don't particularly need anything right now is *itself* productive activity
[14:50:55] <feep[work]> nshepperd: I fundamentally disagree.
[14:50:55] <nshepperd> and deserves reward
[14:51:09] <otoburb> That's the definition of time-value of money. 
[14:51:09] <feep[work]> that's to me exactly the logic that makes bitcoin terrible.
[14:51:16] <nshepperd> consumerism is terrible
[14:51:25] <feep[work]> consumerism is great
[14:51:28] <otoburb> Deferred rewards leads to discount rates. 
[14:51:33] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], which do you prefer, a universe with 3↑↑↑3 people whose experiences are *identical*, or a universe with 10^30 people like on earth?
[14:51:48] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: that is logically incoherent in my framework
[14:51:56] <feep[work]> you cannot have multiple people with identical experiences.
[14:52:14] <nshepperd> i want more of civilizations resources to go to making sure we all die, not building useless trinkets for me that i don't actually want
[14:52:16] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], if you have 2 ems on deterministic hardware that decide the same things, is that just 1 em?
[14:52:17] <otoburb> You could but it would be pretty lonely. 
[14:52:36] <feep[work]> nshepperd: imo long-term investment just results in civilization building way more expensive useless trinkets tomorrow.
[14:52:43] <nshepperd> nah
[14:52:52] <feep[work]> we should build things we actually need, today.
[14:53:09] <feep[work]> that said, investment simply doesn't do what you think it does
[14:53:09] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], ai safety research tho
[14:53:10] <nshepperd> well, then people who actually need things can buy them
[14:53:16] <nshepperd> with the money i deferred
[14:53:25] <feep[work]> no company is actually *putting back resources* so it can use them to produce things in 50 years.
[14:53:25] <nshepperd> that's the whole point
[14:53:46] <nshepperd> i don't need anything now
[14:53:47] <feep[work]> the economy is already optimized for short-term spending, but we still get the investment logic *as if* you could defer production.
[14:53:50] <nshepperd> other people do
[14:54:00] <feep[work]> nshepperd: right, and that would still work for a short term under my model
[14:54:04] <feep[work]> something like 10-50 years.
[14:54:09] <nshepperd> deferring my material needs lets other people use more of civilizations resources now
[14:54:13] <nshepperd> this is good
[14:54:22] <feep[work]> you can defer for a long time. but you shouldn't be able to defer across your lifetime.
[14:54:27] <nshepperd> and thus should be economically rewarded
[14:54:33] <feep[work]> I think it's bad
[14:54:37] <feep[work]> and should be punished
[14:54:42] <nshepperd> ur wrong
[14:54:43] <feep[work]> (but not much)
[14:55:12] <nshepperd> that just hurts the people who would have been able to buy stuff with my money
[14:55:20] <Gurkenglas> so raising children is allowed because its a longterm investment that works in practice

[15:00:49] <feep[work]> "instead of you paying us, why don't you make a contract that guarantees us a steady stream of your ubi"
[15:00:50] <nshepperd> encouraging people to be more impulsive and hedonistic will actually make the world worse
[15:00:55] <feep[work]> I could just make that illegal
[15:01:13] <kuudes> finland had property tax of 0.1% per year above some limit before end of 90s iirc
[15:01:18] <feep[work]> but alternately - the contract is just another item, and so the university would have to put it up for harberger taxation...
[15:01:42] <feep[work]> nshepperd: I disagree.
[15:01:50] <nshepperd> ok
[15:01:57] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], suppose we're in dath ilan and it's greek times, and people have your view. yudkowsky does some experiments on silicon and deduces that in a few centuries they can build a brain out of that. Should the council decide to allow an infinite-term investment because in this instance, the ends outweigh the (which, consequentalist or deontological?) reasoning?
[15:02:07] <kuudes> iirc the employer unions bargained to get rid of it in one of the comprehensive income agreements
[15:02:11] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: no! that's insane
[15:02:28] <feep[work]> and at any rate, not how computers were historically developed at all
[15:02:40] <Gurkenglas> I agree that this is a hypothetical :)
[15:02:43] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: instead, babbage should start a kickstarter
[15:02:46] <kuudes> quanticle, I think I may agree with 100% death tax, but I am not sure
[15:02:51] <nshepperd> I'm glad you're not in charge of the world i guess
[15:03:20] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: like, the model is, in this world people don't fund things because they expect a reward but because they want them to exist for its own sake.
[15:03:32] <feep[work]> people want computers, so, kickstarter for computers.
[15:03:47] <nshepperd> oh you're model is that people are superhappies
[15:03:51] <feep[work]> and hell, if computers are really successful, you *can* have payouts here, just not over the full multi-generational horizon.
[15:03:52] <kuudes> well we already have ~ 10-50% inheritance tax
[15:03:57] <Gurkenglas> aka, anyone who doesnt need money now has no better alternative to donating their surplus
[15:04:13] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: yeah
[15:04:22] <kuudes> and indeed we have gift tax
[15:04:29] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: well hang on no, they can hang on to their money
[15:04:29] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], wouldn't people choose to donate to what will favor them the most in the long term?
[15:04:42] <feep[work]> they just cannot hang on to their money *in perpetuity* with positive rate of accumulation.
[15:05:02] <feep[work]> you can totally buffer across ~10 year gaps.
[15:05:11] <feep[work]> lose like 1, 2%.
[15:06:08] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: sure, but "favor" is either flavor, or taxed.
[15:06:22] <feep[work]> you can totally donate to things you just think are awesome
[15:06:27] <feep[work]> in fact, that's how it's supposed to work
[15:06:38] <Gurkenglas> like, people could donate to lobbyists that would push the laws in their favor in particular
[15:06:45] <feep[work]> I mean, that's always a risk
[15:06:51] <feep[work]> I have no magic answer to corruption :P
[15:07:00] <kuudes> indeed
[15:07:06] <Gurkenglas> and in particular, all of those lobbyists would push against the law of no long-term investments in particular
[15:07:13] <feep[work]> I would however argue that 1. it's an orthogonal issue
[15:07:18] <feep[work]> and 2. in this world, there is no "big money"
[15:07:30] <feep[work]> so you'd have to convince a lot more of the populace that this benefits them than you would in ours.
[15:07:31] <Gurkenglas> orthogonal is a good way to put it: im saying it's in fact correlated
[15:07:49] <Gurkenglas> just like i expect it wasnt an accident that there was loads of corruption in communism
[15:07:52] <feep[work]> like ... if everyone wants to play molochian defection, democracy cannot fix this.
[15:08:34] <feep[work]> but I never promised that this system would be immune to corruption and greed
[15:08:47] <feep[work]> I would however argue that it's still *more* resilient than ours is.
[15:08:51] <nshepperd> hmmm you're literally just reinventing marxism
[15:09:10] <feep[work]> well, if this is marxism then let me draw a line between "marxism" and "stupid marxism" (which is the one that was actually implemented)
[15:09:21] <Gurkenglas> if politicians are rendered incorruptible somehow, the lobbying money would go towards PR instead
[15:09:31] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: I'm not even *trying* to solve that issue.
[15:09:36] <feep[work]> other people can handle that. :p
[15:09:50] <feep[work]> imo it's out of scope of an economic system.
[15:10:05] <feep[work]> nshepperd: I would call my system "free market anti-capitalism"
[15:10:17] <Gurkenglas> i mean, the issue you're not trying to solve is that people, when you dont let them put their money in the bank, will take the nearest unblocked strategy
[15:10:30] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: yes, that is what the harberger taxes are for.
[15:10:44] <feep[work]> I have tried to push "unblocked strategies" out of the realm of economics.
[15:10:52] <feep[work]> I think it does that.
[15:11:14] <feep[work]> someone else can fix the realm of politics :P
[15:11:25] <Gurkenglas> and one of those strategies is "coders (who are currently superproductive) kickstart the guy who writes a story that glorifies coders, so that in the future they'll be liked"
[15:11:35] <feep[work]> that is a valid strategy and I endorse it.
[15:12:17] <feep[work]> nshepperd: I mean, as far as I can see my system allows for price discovery, reward proportional to risk, and does not mention either dictators, genocides or five year plans
[15:12:18] <Gurkenglas> so there would be some additional lawset on what kickstarters are permissible
[15:12:29] <feep[work]> so "if by saying marxism you mean..."
[15:13:27] <feep[work]> I think people attribute a lot more of the benefits of capitalism to the "accumulation of capital" part than is actually warranted.
[15:13:50] <Gurkenglas> instead of a billionaire in dollars we might have a thousandaire in people who know they owe you
[15:14:00] <feep[work]> again, I endorse that outcome.
[15:14:12] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: you may also note that this is basically Doctorow's Whuffie.
[15:16:30] <Gurkenglas> so basically when the 150-people tribe became 15000 people and introduced dollars that was the wrong generalization of (what used to be just called social) capital and we should fix that
[15:16:39] <feep[work]> yes.
[15:19:46] <feep[work]> huh, apparently "free market anti-capitalism" is a blog
[15:20:19] <kuudes> feep[work], "free market anti-capitalism" is smithism as far as I understand
[15:20:21] <feep[work]> seems to lean more anarchist than my idea
[15:20:32] <kuudes> basicly the original free market ideology
[15:20:41] <kuudes> which includes dislike against dominant market powers
[15:21:06] <feep[work]> okay, sorry, this is fascinating and I will read up later but I need to draw a line here
[15:21:11] * feep[work] puts his [work] hat back on
[15:21:12] <kuudes> re earlier discussion on why central planning and not free markets inside companies:
[15:21:29] <kuudes> unregulated free markets allow things like spending money to harm your competitor
[15:21:54] <kuudes> ie buy a guard to hit anyone who tries to go to the store to buy apples, so that you are the only one who can in fact buy apples
[15:21:55] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], so anything protected by the government is subject to harberger tax; and ideally anything you can trust would be
[15:22:11] <kuudes> but apples are still sold at market price, which is now much less, because there are fewer buyers
[15:22:47] <kuudes> so free market ideology includes a value proposition that it is bad if market participants buy guard to hit their competitor
[15:22:52] <Gurkenglas> things you may trust being people (endorsed) and math (not endorsed, illegal)
[15:23:03] <kuudes> in the end, everything is alignment problem
[15:27:51] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: not sure I follow that, but, later.

[15:52:08] <PlanckWalk> I was trying to find out how many total employees they had
[15:53:10] <PlanckWalk> It looks like only about 500, so that's a big chunk of the workforce

[15:53:36] <kuudes> 500 is a lot for a game company
[15:54:06] <kuudes> supercell has 340 persons
[15:54:26] <quanticle> It's not even a game company. It's a company that does microtransaction payment processing for scummy game companies.

[15:55:08] <kuudes> companies are just slow mlm, change my view :D
[15:55:51] <PlanckWalk> ... are you awardign Delta for succeeding in making good points?  Because I don't want Delta.
[15:56:00] <kuudes> but yes, there is the cognitive dissonance that people expect also to get paid next month and next year, even though that was never agreed oon
[15:56:15] <kuudes> ie employment is not a title or equity
[15:59:10] <PlanckWalk> I really wish more people would *feel*, not just vaguely acknowledge that while really brushing off the possibility of having no job next month.
[16:00:31] <kuudes> yes
[16:00:49] <kuudes> and that should be negotiated on
[16:01:35] <kuudes> which is why, after the negotiations, the law here is that indeed that company would be able to fire those 150 persons, but first they would have to go through 3 months of negotiations, and after that the termination period would often be 6 months
[16:02:22] <kuudes> and which is why pensions are collected as payments out of the company same time as salaries are paid, and the company can't accrue them as debt it could discharge out of with a bancruptcy
[16:02:48] <kuudes> on the contrary, the tax office and pension agencies are the biggest claimants on demanding bancruptcies of nonpaying companies
[16:03:11] <kuudes> btw, over here the employers also have voiced lack of employees/hires
[16:03:32] <kuudes> which means it makes now sense that the government raises pension payment percentage etc soon as they announced
[16:03:47] <kuudes> you know, if there is more demand, indeed the supply price should go higher
[16:04:16] <kuudes> and we have had this talking point of sustainability deficit, ie that in future there are more people to get pension because people have increased since past

[22:31:10] <Betawolf> The entry-level cult is that people should try to be more sane and make decisions based on evidence, and we should support each other in a quest to be less insane. The next level of cult is a millenarian transhumanist cult about defeating skynet. The next level of cult is about making anime catgirls real.

[22:32:35] <feep> no like, you seemed like, "I will join this channel and Participate In the Conversation" when in fact the way people here tend to use this channel is sort of drop in and out based on topic at the time
[22:32:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Can't leave out the level after that: mockery of the people who want to make anime catgirls real

[22:35:10] <Pharl> Beep boop.
[22:35:13] <feep> the "cult" thing is ... like, you need to understand that many members of this community are or used to be pretty neurotic
[22:35:29] <gwern> nah, Disagreeable
[22:35:33] <feep> neurotic too
[22:35:38] <feep> so what happened was, people were like "they hang out on this website, and they all read the blog posts of this one guy, is this a cult"
[22:35:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Speak for yourself
[22:35:40] *** Joins: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide)
[22:35:42] <Pharl> Neurotically disagreeable. Got it.
[22:35:49] <feep> and the commenters were like " .... *are* we a cult??"
[22:35:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm only disagreeable
[22:36:06] <feep> yes, yes, not obormot, obormot is confident and stable
[22:36:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dunno if I'd go that far
[22:36:22] <Pharl> So this is a cult with an identity crisis?
[22:36:25] <Pharl> Or a branding problem.
[22:36:34] <feep> anyway, this got so inflamed that for a while people were straight up banning the term "cult" because the *internal discussion* about whether they were a cult was generating bad seo
[22:36:43] <feep> nah, the original cult died like ten years ago
[22:36:45] <Pharl> Oh wow.
[22:36:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> No our branding is fine, now that Eliezer has coined "sanepunk"
[22:37:01] <Pharl> Ha.
[22:37:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> We had a problem before with "rationalist" but those days are behind us
[22:37:15] <feep> and we're now in the phase of "actually, almost everyone who came after was garbage and the cult leader was right about everything"
[22:37:29] <Pharl> I see.
[22:37:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's true
[22:37:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if only Eliezer had read the Sequences
[22:37:48] <feep> so anyway, there's a blog, lesswrong.com (don't read it, read greaterwrong.com instead, obormot's better ui rewrite)
[22:37:58] <feep> and for like a bunch of years this guy eliezer yudkowsky was making blogposts on it

[22:38:45] <feep> "then the world ends."
[22:38:57] <mst> Pharl: the best way to get a feel for any IRC channel is the traditional "lurk moar" approach - i.e. chill out, watch the conversation go past, figure out the social norms by what actually happens
[22:39:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Are you sure any of this explanation is really helpful or makes sense
[22:39:10] <feep> because you see, eliezer had not just realized that "he needed to make the ai actually safe for humans" but he had also realized that *he hadn't realized that* he needed to make the ai actually safe for humans
[22:39:12] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: since when was that ever part of our social norms?
[22:39:16] <feep> and *nobody else* working on ai was realizing that either.

[22:45:19] <two2thehead> kuudes, what's the general consensus on covid19 reservoirs in antivaxx communities, do you know?
[22:45:35] <feep> like, people see readthesequences.com and think we're a closed canon
[22:45:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe I could embed them on the Talk pages hmmmmm
[22:45:59] <feep> this is a core part of my "we are not a cult honest" strategy
[22:46:14] <Betawolf> cults are more effective
[22:46:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Also fyi moreright.com was a real site that I think Anissimov or someone made back in the day
[22:46:21] <feep> yes yes that post did not help :v
[22:46:27] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: haha
[22:46:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was an amusing pun but the site didn't last at all
[22:46:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shameful really
[22:47:05] <dbohdan> mst: I agree it's ugly.  [] around the "Images: ..." block, however, will risk a client attaching a "]" to the final image URL.  Instead, I'll just try separating the tweet from the images with a "|".  I already use "|" everywhere anyway.
[22:47:20] <feep> Pharl: anyway eventually enough people funded eliezer's ai safety project that he went "okay, this blogging has done its job, time to actually focus on mathematical research" so he transitioned to shitposting on facebook and the site died
[22:47:20] <mst> dbohdan: that would also work, yeah
[22:47:44] <mst> dbohdan: though given you have 'Images: <url> (<analysis>)' I don't understand what risk you're imagining
[22:47:57] <mst> dbohdan: if there's no analysis just, like, leave the space there
[22:48:19] <mst> (that doesn't mean it's superior to |, mind, it just means your specific objection is silly)
[22:48:23] <feep> at this point, there was what was called the "rationalist diaspora"; without the common thread of eliezer's post, we got lots of small subcommunities instead, rationalist tumblr, rationalist facebook, slatestarcodex, gwern.net ... and this channel also
[22:48:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then they resurrected it with LIGHTNING made out of JAVASCRIPT turning it into some sort of HORRIBLE MONSTER that is a METAPHOR for the SINS of MODERNITY
[22:48:31] <feep> rationalist fanfics*
[22:48:45] <dv^_^> don't forget ratanon
[22:48:48] <feep> yes
[22:48:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> ratanon is also dead
[22:48:59] <feep> and yeah, the current lesswrong.com *is* one of the subcommunities that splintered from the diaspora
[22:49:09] <dbohdan> It gets a post every few months or so
[22:49:17] <feep> oyeah, you should note, like 30% of the people involved are jews, so you get a lot of bible metaphors

[22:49:54] <gwern> feep: this channel dates back to like 2008 or earlier, you could hardly call it diaspora
[22:50:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: feep meant LW 2.0, the site
[22:50:09] <feep> Pharl: anyway, then by usercount, slatestarcodex (scott alexander's blog) basically took over the readership with a mix of being a *really genuinely good person* and occasionally having spicy culture war hot takes
[22:50:21] <feep> gwern: the channel as a *distinct community* has diaspored hard.
[22:50:35] <dbohdan> mst: The caption is only generated for the first image (due to time constraints).  I'll try "|" first, because "[Images: ... ]" seems unpleasantly asymmetrical.
[22:50:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Uh this is like four years inactive
[22:50:49] <dbohdan> "[ Images: ... ]"?
[22:51:03] <Pharl> Cool. Seems like a chill place to talk about interesting stuff, or just have a laugh.
[22:51:08] <feep> Pharl: well, I say hot takes - *very, very well cooked* takes, ssc is known for really long effortposts with clever twists and a highly engaging style

[22:52:30] <feep> (it is also one of the typographically and stylistically prettiest sites on the net)
[22:52:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Oh the default sort order is weird, nm

[22:53:10] <feep> lots of empiricism and stats, and clearly marked epistemic status

[22:58:14] <feep> Pharl: like, we have previously disagreed about *whether musical harmony exists.*

[22:58:23] <Pharl> Heh
[22:58:37] <feep> (but like, wild in a really boring nerdy way)
[22:58:48] <Pharl> Yeah, absolutely.
[22:58:54] <Pharl> I am among my people.
[22:59:00] <feep> :3
[22:59:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> I admit that musical harmony probably exists, but I remain somewhat skeptical
[22:59:10] <feep> I hear that feeling is pretty common yeah
[22:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Since it allegedly can't be demonstrated to *me*
[22:59:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which, you must admit, is suspicious
