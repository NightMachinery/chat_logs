[14:58:04] <no_gravity> Oh, the greedy *!
[15:00:18] <Me-me> You mean "captures" - it matches the whole string.
[15:00:50] <Me-me> But yes, the answer is the greedy * at the start there. You could change it to *? but that would slow it down, at least compared to just being more specific.
[15:00:54] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/wFGBr9/2
[15:01:27] <Me-me> You could also replace [^\n\S] with \h - which in PCRE and some others matches horizontal whitespace. But not every flavour has that.

[17:43:33] <ZZzz> so I choose this as an example to makes things more simple
[17:43:42] <Me-me> That's not how making things simple works.
[17:46:16] <ZZzz> digitok: you didn't exclude something but rather you have limited the inclusion... I try to understand how exclusion/negating can work in such a case
[17:46:38] <digitok> and you didn't follow the instructions
[17:47:08] <Me-me> As I said, how we exclude depends on the rest of your pattern.
[17:47:15] <Me-me> So please tell us the rest of your pattern.
[17:47:24] <Me-me> Preferably in regex101.com, where we can then experiment.
[17:53:04] <ZZzz> Ok, so I'll give the real regex and real data... I hope regex101.com will be able to display it
[17:53:34] <Me-me> Alright.

[17:59:14] <ZZzz> everything that is bellow "-------" should be excluded...
[17:59:49] <ZZzz> but I need exclusion of two characters - and the rest I'll figure out...
[17:59:55] <ZZzz> (as example)
[18:00:59] <Me-me> Is there a reason you can't anchor the pattern?
[18:01:13] <Me-me> Ah, anchor doesn't help.
[18:03:12] <Me-me> So all those characters underneath are the ones to be excluded?

[18:04:09] <Me-me> But aren't. Hmm.
[18:04:32] <ZZzz> now you see why I wanted to use a, b, c :)
[18:05:10] <ZZzz> those are two chars actually
[18:05:19] <Me-me> Aye. Character and metacritic.
[18:05:25] <ZZzz> א
[18:05:29] <ZZzz> and
[18:05:58] <Me-me> I can't see that second one.
[18:06:25] <ZZzz> ָ
[18:07:37] <ZZzz> normally א comes first... but I have garbage in my data where their order was switched
[18:07:41] <digitok> fyi, you don't need [] if it's just one property you have
[18:07:43] <ZZzz> I need to exclude those cases
[18:08:56] <Me-me> So I notice that the lines to be accepted also start with א - so is the ָ the one that needs to be excluded, or the א?
