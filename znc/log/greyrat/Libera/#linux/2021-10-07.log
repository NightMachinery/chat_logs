[08:15:14] <rustytaco> hmm - it almost sounds like theres an external java library named rxtx - its built against one version 2.1-7 but you have 2.2pre2 installed in wherever java's libraries go

[08:16:30] <MinusOne> genoobie, I am not certain if a java library is packaged as a jar. My understanding is that jars are for executables. Libraries may just be java files

[08:17:12] <MinusOne> genoobie, if you installed the xrtx library manually (not had it pulled in as a dependency) then yes, that would likely solve your problem

[08:18:44] <rustytaco> The chips themselves have backdoors, like intel ME and AMDs thing. they're well known to exist. and arguably since they're in the chip itself, can you really trust it's turned off when it says "OK, im off now" because you said "Turn off"?

[12:42:18] <kirk781> Drat, my MTP connection is acting up as well. Don't know if it is actually an hardware issue or it'll magically resolve itself as soon as I boot into a different distro.
[12:42:34] <hexnewbie> That said, setting promisc on the bond should make the kernel do the smart thing and set the interfaces in the same mode, I think. Useless unless you're inspecting traffic for other machines, or without asking the switch to send you this traffic. Has promisc mode done anything useful (except for bridging, obviously) in sniffing land since the switch was invented?

[12:43:52] <hexnewbie> Hmm, also, I *think* that the promisc switch seen in e.g. ‘ip link’ is what the user has requested for the interface, but if a bridge makes the interface implicitly promisc in hardware for it to act as a bridge, you still don't see the promisc mode in ‘ip link’
[12:43:55] <ayecee> the switch will only forward traffic destined for the host unless otherwise configured

[20:17:24] <Psi-Jack> joo: Virtual Machines are a very nice way to run servers when done properly. They allow for portability and more options of backup and restore.
[20:17:38] <bindi> probably containers instead of VMs, more lightweight
[20:17:40] <joo> It is not more vulnerable to loss or anything because of the extra layers ?

[21:21:01] <NiLon> jackiee all languages use same concepts, the "language" is just a syntax (over simplified of course) that if you know what you want is just few hours of learning. Understanding the internals takes little bit more tho
[21:21:03] <jim> rust being a compiled language, so there will be coding, followed by some time to compile the code before you can run it
[21:21:03] <jackiee> akk: wow thats so cool. that makes it feel a little less daunting seeing a few people here say they self taught.Although you guys are probably smarter than me haha.  I definitely want to pursue school regardless. but Ill definitely try

[22:46:21] <Meowlon_Nekomoto> I'm not an expert. But my common sense tells me that if you're chrooted, you can't chroot again to anywhere that isn't inside the directory you've already chrooted into
[22:46:21] <jackiee> maybe im misunderstanding.( I only ever use chroot myself to manipulate an unmounted partition/filesystem. from a different disk/partition)  But if i were to place an invader in a chroot container because i fear they will gain root access, this places the rest of the FS ownerless? But if they get root access, couldnt they just chroot the FS back to normakl
[22:46:40] <jackiee> oh okay
[22:47:15] <Meowlon_Nekomoto> but potentially, if you don't log them out or something when they exit, they could potentially just exit the chroot?
[22:47:18] <jackiee> yeah that makes sense. if i chroot into a partition from a different disk. like a live gentoo usb. i cant maniplulate the FS on the usb unless i exit the chroot container
