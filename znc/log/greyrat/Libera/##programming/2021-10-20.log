[08:30:50] <xeno> ah ok
[08:30:54] <pikapika> Guest9645, thanks

[08:32:03] <pikapika> xeno, I was asking about memory usage
[08:32:41] <xeno> pikapika: don't think there's any issues with < 4gb, but not sure how that affects performance 
[08:32:59] <Guest9645> then #freebsd :) (tho you need registering); or #freebsd-irc (not sure support there)

[08:34:12] <xeno> pikapika: it doesn't matter if you have > 4gb of memory if that memory is in use by applications btw, so you should probably rather think about needed free memory 
[08:34:21] <pikapika> xeno, <4gb
[08:34:24] <pikapika> not >4gb
[08:35:02] <Guest9645> I guess <= 4 gb is good; you can always choose a light windows manager (tho not user of freebsd)
[08:35:25] <xeno> yeah, but if you have 4gb of memory and you're running a 3 1/2 gb application, or you have 2 gb of memory and run a 500mb application, then it's basically the same thing
[08:35:49] <xeno> zfs is also older than having 4gb of memory
[08:35:54] <pikapika> Guest9645, window manager is not the problem
[08:36:06] <pikapika> I have been told to adjust the arc limits
[08:36:20] <Guest9645> for swap?
[08:36:39] <xeno> pikapika: anyway, as Guest9645 said, ##freebsd, or even ##zfs (probably is one)
[08:36:41] <pikapika> the zfs cache thing
[08:36:49] <pikapika> already on freebsd yeah
[08:36:51] <Guest9645> I see
[08:37:21] <Guest9645> I don't manage zfs
[08:37:32] <pikapika> Its just that it was offered as the default fs during installation
[08:37:40] <pikapika> and I didn't know about these things then so just went with it
[08:38:18] <pikapika> I will probably use ufs on a real install then
[08:38:30] <Guest9645> linux uses ext4 afaik

[11:30:25] <vdamewood> Usually filesystem metadata is held in physical blocks on the disk with no name. NTFS does store some data in hidden files, but there's a lot that's not in actual files.

[11:32:48] <vdamewood> file /dev/sda6
[11:32:50] <Belxjander> vdamewood: give qemu the loopback... and feed the partition itself to the loopback instead of a file...

[11:33:41] <vdamewood> Belxjander: But a partition itself can already be used as a block device, since it is a block device. A loopback doesn't do anything useful there.

[13:07:07] <LiaoTao> PlanckWalk, They keep not including Microsoft for some reason.

[13:08:50] <LiaoTao> s/to/from
[13:08:59] <Inst> Since, Python is easy to learn, has extensive library support
[13:09:13] <Inst> drawbacks would be the lack of performance, but I'm learning C++ for that
[13:09:36] *** Joins: kron (~weechat@user/qaph)
[13:09:38] <Jong> deniska  but it's not about testing. It's about collecting stats. Like suppose you had a program that trained a neural net and the cli argument was how many hidden layers to use
[13:09:48] <piou> Inst: frankly, just by your reaction it seems you should learn python. Of course it's different from C++ and Haskell, and clearly in ways that you're not accustomed to, but if you do learn the Python way you'll have a true new tool in your pocket, not a language in which you write a degraded version of C++ or Haskell

[13:13:16] <piou> Both of which are useful tbf

[13:13:45] <Inst> I'm planning a project that coordinates data for a game

[13:15:40] <Inst> okay, fine, i'll get further along in C++ and Haskell, then try python and JS at the same time
[13:15:52] <Inst> the innovation I'm looking for is to provide a GUI

[13:16:28] <Inst> right now, it's all done via people talking to each other via discord, but providing a proper operational / organizational management system would significantly increase efficiencies

[14:50:45] <xsperry> piou, you brushed haskell off together with C++ as unsuitable for making simple websites. while that may be true for C++, making a website in haskell is just as easy as in python, provided you know the language. it is one of the things haskell is pretty good at
[14:51:25] <piou> xsperry: I did not do that, and took the time to clarify what I said, please just stop there.
[14:51:27] <arahael> xsperry: That rather depends on which framework you go with, though.
[14:51:35] <DnzAtWrk> seems like you're mixing two concepts
[14:51:38] <DnzAtWrk> websites and web servers
[14:51:50] <xsperry> piou, then what does "I would never chose haskell (and C++) for making a simple website" imply?
[14:51:55] <arahael> xsperry: Eg, for my personal project, I made the mistake of going with Yesod.
[14:52:01] <DnzAtWrk> why do you need your own web server?
[14:52:02] <xsperry> that doesn't read like a personal, subjective choice
[14:52:35] <arahael> That said, haskell is *awesome* for web servers.

[14:53:50] <piou> xsperry: first of all that's not what I said, please quote me correctly "you'll never see me reach for C++ or haskell" and it means that I (refering to me) would never reach for them for that specific task (namely "a simple website")
[14:54:14] <piou> xsperry: I mean, that's pretty spelled out. It's a personnal statement over made in a very specific context
[14:54:29] <xsperry> arahael, I have not used yesod before. template haskell used all over the place turned me off. I like scotty, and servant is also pretty popular
[14:54:49] <arahael> xsperry: I nearly considered scotty, but it was unmaintained when I looked at it.
[14:54:55] <xsperry> piou, in the context of trying to convince person to learn python, instead of using C++ or haskell. I stand by what I said

[14:56:12] <xsperry> he is entitled to his opinion, but he should stick to them, or admit he was wrong and doesn't know haskell, or how hard or simple it is to make a website in it, instead of falsely attacking me for misinterpreting his pretty clear statements
[14:56:16] <piou> xsperry: what you could do instead of attacking my factual statement is explain to Inst that you think Haskell is better suited for the task than I made it seem, and it would be much more respectful and constructive
[14:56:55] <piou> xsperry: I know it's easy to do a website in Haskell, but I like Python better for that so there's really no reason for me to use Haskell, there's no general statement here
[14:57:04] <xsperry> piou, I wasn't attacking you, I provided information that haskell is a lot closer to python than to C++ for this task. it is you who started to get all worked up and defensive about it
[14:57:23] <arahael> You two are somewhat talking at cross purposes...
[14:57:29] <piou> xsperry: you're doing so by specifically taking me aside and saying that my statement is wrong, which it isn't
[14:57:39] <piou> Because it's very personnal
[14:57:52] <DnzAtWrk> it seems like you're arguing over nothing
[14:58:18] <piou> xsperry: if you want to say that Haskell is a nice language please do so by arguing that haskell is a nice language, don't single me out criticizing my opinion, that's useless and annoying
[14:59:13] <piou> There's no reason to take the fact that I personnaly don't want to build websites with haskell as an attack of the language or a critique of its ability to achieve the task
[14:59:15] <xsperry> piou, "I would never pick bash or fortrain for making administration script". <- does that sound like stating a personal opinion, or that the person making the statement is pretty clueless that bash is suitable for this task, and that fortain isn't?

[17:17:32] <mrig> pyzozord: If you read about race conditions, sometimes you cant with a debugger, it could be that the problem will arise once in 1000 runs.

[23:14:08] <Guest78> which book can i follow to master  these concept of oops
[23:14:09] <user51> might not really scale but it looks nice
[23:14:23] <decker> Guest78 static methods don't get 'this'  they're not alled with a obj.function();  but with class:function()
[23:14:49] <decker> and operate more on the type itself - or with a single local state

[23:15:47] <user51> well, there was this âˆ€ thing, it was âˆ€x(x>7)->(x>6)
[23:16:05] <user51> hm, think i forgot a paren there
[23:16:23] <user51> anyway, x 7 > x 6 > âˆ€ is also pretty easy to write

[23:17:05] <user51> imo i think one advantage is that it reads in language order, and you could underline for groups
[23:17:24] <user51> language order = left to right, without any implicit precedence

[23:17:36] <Guest78> decker ..can you give me some resouces to understand these concepts ..Sorry i didnt fully understand you ..I only got a vaugue idea ...Thanks decer for answering my question
[23:18:20] <user51> i sometimes wonder if math is hindered by notationl problems
[23:18:44] <Guest78> decker ..I read wikipedia about static ..and got more confused only
[23:18:49] <decker> Guest78 know any other languages?  static methods in a class are also what's used to link to C with JNI
[23:19:12] <decker> what do you think static is?
[23:19:38] <user51> GeDaMo: oh, and my lecturer said that there was no way to do programming without variables, forth wins again

[23:20:33] <Guest78> decker I have only some priliminary knowlege in c
[23:20:54] <decker> static doesn't mean 'hidden' like in C
[23:21:20] <decker> but it makes it just a function... you can call

[23:21:30] <decker> you don't need a object/class instance to call the function... 
[23:21:51] <pikapika> in java when applied to a class variable static means its a class not object member
[23:21:55] <decker> (or static data members in  a class - static methods can work with those
[23:23:16] <decker> it means there will always be one of them... that somewhere there's space allocated in the program image for the static data
[23:23:51] <decker> (all code - the image of the code itself is static data)

[23:55:00] <johncs> i'd say you don't really avoid it per se. you do your best to muddle through and minimize the debt you can, balancing the effort of it amongst all the other priorities you have.
