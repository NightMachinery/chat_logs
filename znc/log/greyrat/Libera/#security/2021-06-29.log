[08:32:14] <NightFish_> I guess it really depends on your scope. You cant possibly protect everything from supply chain attacks. That would require you doing literally everything in house, e.g. making your own computing hardware. And that would assume you can ultimately trust your in house production. The attack could come from inside too.

[15:27:54] <shad> I built a python cli that pg_dump my dbs from Docker to a file, and now I want to encrypt the dump file. Problem is how do I give the passphrase to the script ?
[15:28:59] <shad> The idea was to put the script in root's crontab and have it run once everyday so it can rotate & delete old dumps. Problem is that crontab logs the entire command line to syslog and that file can be read by non privileged users, so i can't pass the passphrase as a CLI argument there
[15:29:18] *** Joins: `Tim (~zenguin@user/zenguin)
[15:29:26] <shad> do I hardcode it in the script and make it only root readable, or is there a different way i'm missing ?
[15:29:56] <soulisson> shad, I'm not sure to understand.  Could you explain the first sentence "pg_dump my dbs from Docker"
[15:31:26] *** Joins: self (~elf@user/elf)
[15:32:06] <shad> I'm devops. I have several servers for my clients that have a running postgresql in a database, and I want to make backups of the databases in case shit hits the fan. I wrote a cli like this to help

[15:33:49] <shad> Now i felt like adding a CLI param, "--enc-key SomeRandomPassword" that would encrypt the database backups, but if i do that, the password will appear in clear for any user in /var/log/syslog if the script is invoked from root's crontab
[15:33:54] <soulisson> shad, ok, you could use .pgpass file for the root user with the right permissions
[15:34:26] <soulisson> oh sorry, you want to encrypt the dump file, I misred
[15:34:31] <soulisson> *misread
[15:35:25] <shad> I'm logging locally using postgres user inside the docker using python's docker SDK, i don't need to authent to the psql. I'm just looking for a "secure-ish" way to give a password to my script and have it use that in a symmetric encryption for the dumps
[15:36:06] <shad> I think i remember a hackthebox scenario where I used "pspy", that password would probably appear there aswell
[15:37:49] <soulisson> shad, I don't know how you can save securely the password to be honest. what would happen if you use something in the cmd line like $(cat /root/secret.txt)?
[15:38:49] <shad> could be that, but it means creating another file and such. I don't care for the scenario where root is owned, we're fucked anyways in that case :D
[15:39:30] <soulisson> or as a env var?
[15:40:29] <shad> Since i have n servers that'll use that python CLI, i was gonna install it to the servers and add it to crontab using Ansible. i *can* create a root readable only file, but that's more work i wanted to skip
[15:41:43] <shad> env var is still having to manage a .env file next to the script. I'll probably just declare a global "passphrase = "{{ BACKUP_PASSPHRASE }}"" and template it via ansible i guess. Since the script will only be root readable it'd do
[15:42:53] <soulisson> shad, what about gpg you could probably use a public key?

[16:05:31] <Kryczek> the TPM computes a SHA1 (TPM 1.x) or SHA2-256 (TPM 2.0) hash of various things in the boot process, and puts the result in one of the Platform Configuration Registers
[16:06:21] <Kryczek> for example the hash of the BIOS code goes into PCR0, the hash of the BIOS settings goes into PCR1, the hash of the Option ROM (BIOS of the network card in case of PXE boot) goes into PCR2, its settings into PCR3, hash of the MBR goes into PCR4 and so on
[16:07:13] <soulisson> Kryczek, ok, and then what happens?
[16:07:50] <Kryczek> then you can select some of these PCRs (e.g. usually people don't select PCR1 as it means they wouldn't be able to boot if they change a BIOS setting)
[16:08:13] <Kryczek> and the TPM uses their values like a combination lock
[16:08:54] <Kryczek> this way you can say for example that the key to unlock your encrypted partition should be made available only if PCR0=..., PCR4=... etc

[16:13:56] <soulisson> I think I understand even less, lol :) I think I mistake measured boot with secure boot
[16:14:02] <Kryczek> a TPM has many functions, already in 1.2 and even more in 2.0
[16:14:06] <Kryczek> well, not your fault
[16:14:28] <Kryczek> it was called TPM Secure Boot before Microsoft introduced confusion as always and brought UEFI Secure Boot
[16:14:36] <Kryczek> so now the TPM one is called Trusted Boot or Measured Boot
[16:15:12] <Kryczek> Secure Boot as in UEFI, phones etc is much more simple:
[16:16:11] <Kryczek> the initial code (BIOS or whatever you want to call it) trusts a particular public key, or a PKI, and will agree to boot something only if it is digitally signed by that key/PKI
[16:16:11] *** Quits: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:16:57] <Kryczek> you can use UEFI Secure Boot and TPM Measure Boot at the same time, for defense in depth, fun, why not etc
[16:17:32] <soulisson> Kryczek, ok, where are stored the signatures for "secure boot", in the TPM?
[16:17:49] <Kryczek> TPM Secure Boot or are you talking about UEFI?
[16:18:29] <Kryczek> as I was starting to say with 15:44 < Kryczek> a TPM has many functions, already in 1.2 and even more in 2.0
[16:19:07] <Kryczek> a TPM is basically a HSM and much more, with those PCRs that I described above but also with non-volatile memory
[16:19:18] <soulisson> I think the UEFI thing.
[16:19:30] <Kryczek> lemme finish the NVRAM thing first :P
[16:19:41] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[16:21:15] <Kryczek> if having to store the TPM sealed data blob somewhere is a problem (e.g. you want to use Measured Boot on a CD-ROM and you don't want to have to add a USB stick just for that blob) you can store secrets in the few banks of non-volatile memory that the TPM has, and with the same principle it will agree to reveal the contents only if your selection of PCRs matches the expected values
[16:21:46] <Kryczek> as for the UEFI thing, keys are either hardcoded to be the Microsoft ones if the vendor sucks
[16:21:58] <Kryczek> otherwise it's an option in the BIOS/UEFI settings, you can load your own keys etc

[16:25:38] <soulisson> OK, for the mesasured boot, during the boot process, the TPM compute some hashes, it stores them in the PCRS.
[16:25:41] <soulisson> ?
[16:25:58] <Kryczek> yes
[16:28:59] <soulisson> Then the PCRS are signed?
[16:29:36] *** Joins: shad (~shad@user/shad)
[16:29:57] <Kryczek> only when sealing data, when generating that output blob
[16:30:31] <soulisson> so the signature is not performed during the boot process?
[16:31:13] <Kryczek> no no, you can do it manually with the tpm-tools package for example and the tpm_sealdata command
[16:31:49] <Kryczek> you would do that basically only once, when you are sure you have booted a trustworthy system (e.g. right after installing it)
[16:32:21] <Kryczek> and you might have to redo that sometimes when you upgrade the kernel for example, but you can automate it with the initramfs-tools
[16:32:55] <Kryczek> nowadays there might be packages that do all that for you, like tpm-luks maybe, I just have been doing it manually from the beginning
[16:33:00] <Kryczek> manually/myself
[16:33:12] <soulisson> Kryczek, ok. So I have this "valid" PCRS and the signature. Are those stored in the TPM nvram or somewhere else?

[16:33:49] <Kryczek> signature is only for tpm_sealdata and tpm_unsealdata
[16:34:09] <Kryczek> the tpm_nv commands work differently, they do not need a signature as the TPM stores everything within itself

[16:45:06] <Kryczek> if the OS is programmed that way, yes

[16:45:59] <Kryczek> then the OS might choose to show just a warning and ask you to type your passphrase manually for example, but that would be at your own risk since "something is wrong" might mean "you are being keylogged"

[16:52:08] <Kryczek> it might make a bit more sense in the case of Remote Attestation (basically verifying Measured Boot remotely) with Linux-IMA measuring every single file, but again it would most likely make more sense to have the system partition encrypted
[16:52:27] <soulisson> Kryczek, ok, thanks a lot. what prevents someone with physical access to the hard drive, to change it by another one and fake everything. Would the user be able to see it?
[16:52:49] <Kryczek> it depends
[16:53:34] <Kryczek> since you can ask the TPM to measure whatever you want, into an unused PCR or by "extending" one of the used ones, you could for example have a measurement of the drive's serial number
[16:54:07] <Kryczek> but then again that could be faked I guess, it would be more to make the attacker's job harder
[16:55:14] <Kryczek> if an attacker clones your drive and replaces it, in general everything would be fine: the attacker still cannot decrypt the original or the clone, and the clone inside your PC cannot do anything differently from the original
[16:55:25] <soulisson> Kryczek, I meant what prevent an attacker from taking a brand new hard drive and not even using the TPM. He would for instance simply create a fake dm_crypt login screen, etc.
[16:55:27] <Kryczek> there is a slight attack around those lines though
[16:55:39] <Kryczek> where if you are not careful about what you measure and how you handle TPM errors

[16:57:29] <Kryczek> if mistakes were made, this could lead to a situation where your bootstrap from your /boot will not completely stop when it fails to unlock the attacker's system partition (or there might simply be no need if it's not an encrypted partition)
[16:58:04] <Kryczek> then the attacker system is booted, and if the TPM was left open, the attacker can now ask the TPM to unseal your secret

[16:59:57] <soulisson> Kryczek, ok, I think I understand. As an attacker, can I take a new hard drive, install my own operating system, ... and put replace the victim's hard drive for instance?
[17:00:21] <Kryczek> you need to copy the victim's /boot to be able to get the expected PCR values
[17:01:22] <soulisson> Kryczek, ok, but if the operating system I installed doesn't use TPM at all, nothing stops this system from booting, no?
[17:01:46] <Kryczek> and the victim's /boot needs to have forgotten to measure things like disk serial number and LUKS header, as well as more importantly to lock the TPM until next boot once it doesn't need it anymore
[17:02:16] <Kryczek> yeah a TPM doesn't prevent you from using a computer, you could always boot a liveCD for example
[17:02:40] <Kryczek> it's UEFI Secure Boot which can be used to make a computer completely unusable if not booting the expected OS

[17:06:29] <Kryczek> ibx2496: of course :) like any FDE disk not using the TPM: you would see a bit of unprotected data (typically the bootstrap) as it is not-really-Full Disk Encryption, but after that it should be all encrypted
[17:08:10] <soulisson> Kryczek, I believe in UEFI secure boot, the uefi checks the boot loader, then the boot loader checks the kernel and the other files, ... Is that right?
[17:09:13] <Kryczek> soulisson: it would be an overkill way of keylogging but yeah, like some sort of phishing :) in most cases I would expect the user to realize that nothing is theirs past the credentials prompt, unless it is some thin client or something that actually didn't contain any data itself and you're MITM the whole thing
[17:09:54] <ibx2496> so having Windows fast boot(locking the disk state) is safer in that matter of time, (don't remember how I got out of that state, booted without sata cable or something to unlock when I had that issue on dual boot)
[17:11:38] <Kryczek> soulisson: yes but both of them can do this sort of chaining, that's what Linux-IMA does for example, measuring all the way to executables themselves etc
[17:12:27] <soulisson> Kryczek, yeah, I understand. This is just an extreme example that came to my mind. Do some distributions make it very clear that the "Measured Boot" went ok?

[19:48:56] <calmclam> They might take action against the user though, but would almost certainly not tell you who they are
[19:50:15] <MadCamel> yeah you're not going to get that kind of info on a customer without a warrant.

[19:51:21] <simbaclaws> I'm gonna try and see if I can find a username of some of his accounts with sherlock then
[19:51:26] <calmclam> If you don't want to get the law involved you might be able to hire a lawyer who could then work with the court to get that info
[19:51:53] <simbaclaws> we do want to get the law involved, but the law tends to be slow and bad
[19:52:00] <simbaclaws> and a lawyer is really expensive

They know you're doing a 2 people job, they just don't care about the potential consequences. I remember for one of the companies I worked for (a small company, less than 20 people), one of my coworker was involved in a very serious car accident. The CEO did not care at all.

[21:15:08] <beanbag-> Reliability. Devices upgraded to Windows 11 will be in a supported and reliable state. By choosing CPUs that have adopted the new Windows Driver model and are supported by our OEM and silicon partners who are achieving a 99.8% crash free experience.
[21:15:27] <beanbag-> that's a shame they don't allow the option to run older hw and just have less reliability

[21:51:16] <Roey> soulisson, beanbag-, did you guys read that the Colonia Pipeline attack happened b/c of no MFA on their VPN?
[21:51:37] <Roey> and the credentials of one contractor or worker had been stolen & posted online
[21:51:56] <Roey> and without MFA, the attacker simply authenticated into their VPN with a username/password

[21:52:42] <Roey> that don't do MFA with their VPNs.
[21:52:56] <Roey> this is a big deal.
[21:53:02] <beanbag-> they should just make $50 cheap tablets for remote workers
[21:53:10] <beanbag-> locked down os with vpn etc and all that stuff you mentioned
[21:53:18] <beanbag-> rather than just using someone's desktop
[21:53:28] <Roey> aye
[21:53:34] <Roey> exactly, no BYOD shit
[21:53:54] <Roey> also, they should lock those suckers' USB ports down so that they only accept Organization-owned & encrypted USB sticks

[21:57:11] <beanbag-> you know you can run sane from cli
[21:57:32] <beanbag-> the only issue would be sizing your scan dimentions so you might have to fire up a gui once and then save the config

[22:06:30] <NthDegree> Windows is inbetween as it isolates based on High, Medium, Low, Untrusted, AppContainer labels
[22:06:46] <NthDegree> on a server, however, things are flipped
[22:06:54] *** catties is now known as drcattiesmd
[22:06:59] <bewees> NthDegree: hypervisor type 1 should remove Xorg vulnerability as each vm runs their own Xorg
[22:07:29] *** drcattiesmd is now known as catties
[22:07:40] <NthDegree> bewees, you can achieve isolation beyond what macOS does with Wayland
[22:07:54] <bewees> whereas Qubes writes a dedicated framebuffer for each VM and Xorg is only run on a separate VM (guivm)
[22:08:05] <bewees> mhm
[22:08:54] <beanbag-> yep

[22:10:27] <beanbag-> heh 1st gen didnt even get meltdown/spincter patches
[22:10:31] <bewees> ehm sorry, each vm in qubes runs its own xorg server, but only the guivm uses pci passthrough and assigns separate framebuffers to each vm

[22:14:51] <bewees> "on a server, however, things are flipped" flipped as in Linux would be the choice?

[22:15:34] <NthDegree> you could run a Linux server with true least privilege for every individual process
[22:15:39] <bewees> Especially with SELinux RBAC and MCS
[22:16:01] <NthDegree> SELinux is actually the weaker option in that regard
[22:16:19] <bewees> how so?
[22:16:25] <NthDegree> If you run an application server which doesn't have interactive users TOMOYO can contain stuff even better
[22:16:55] <NthDegree> every single process with TOMOYO can be auto-profiled as a complete execution chain
[22:17:29] <NthDegree> meaning /usr/bin/bash executed by say systemd differs from /usr/bin/bash as executed by ssh and even /usr/bin/bash executed by bash executed by bash could have its own policy confinement
[22:18:05] <NthDegree> and last I checked it supported per-IP restrictions and everything too
[22:18:34] <NthDegree> when combined with seccomp-bpf and such, you get true least privilege for server apps
[22:18:42] <bewees> NthDegree: never heard of tomoyo, just read it up, there's apparently also a fork named "akari"
[22:19:16] <NthDegree> it's not a fork per-se
[22:19:20] <NthDegree> but an alternative option
[22:19:22] <NthDegree> https://akari.osdn.jp/comparison.html.en
[22:19:35] <bewees> "Tomoyo was merged in Linux Kernel mainline version 2.6.30 (2009, June 10" so it should be on my system? let me check
[22:19:42] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@gateway/tor-sasl/shibboleth)
[22:19:52] <NthDegree> the merged version isn't the same as the externally patched version :p
[22:19:59] <bewees> oh i see
[22:20:03] <NthDegree> merged one uses LSM and is a bit nerfed compared to the patched copy
[22:20:17] <NthDegree> it's almost there tho
[22:20:32] <NthDegree> and if I remember rightly, the non-LSM version can stack
[22:20:44] <NthDegree> so you could use an LSM like SELinux alongside the non-LSM version of TOMOYO
[22:21:07] <bewees> on what distro do you recommend to run tomoyo? i know you can install on any linux, but some distros may have better maintained packages
[22:21:16] <NthDegree> I've not used TOMOYO in ages
[22:21:27] * NthDegree last used it when he was a teenager
[22:21:36] <bewees> "LSM like SELinux alongside the non-LSM version of TOMOYO" nice
[22:21:48] <NthDegree> allegedly the LSM version stacks now too
[22:22:24] <NthDegree> so in theory, one could maybe hack a Fedora kernel to use both at the same time? >_>

[22:24:19] <bewees> basically I was weighing up if it's worth buying a laptop with QubesOS to use to connect to my network with ssh from outside my home or just use my surface tablet with windows. so it sounds like windows isn't that bad security wise for gui use, although qubes should put xorg into limits and I could also run a linux hypervisor with LSM and work from the vms
[22:24:22] <bewees> what do you think? :-)
[22:25:28] <bewees> using my own KVM/QEMU hypervisor configuration has the advantage that I can use wayland, whereas qubes only ships xorg, but considering there security model it probably doesn't matter
