[18:33:21] <rovanion> I mean I get it, but it's essentially wizardry at this point.
[18:34:19] <rovanion> Anyone got a shorthand for updating multiple keys in a map with the same function?
[18:35:54] <rovanion> I just got scared that my latest refactoring had ruined the performance of my web service. Pages with lots of rows in a table had started taking half a second to load. Turns out I had forgotten a prn in a function that ran per cell of those tables. With that gone we were back to 30ms for the same page.
[18:37:08] <rovanion> Or 15ms depending on gc I guess.
[18:38:55] <ridcully_> rovanion: if you have specter already on board: (transform [(submap [:a :b]) MAP-VALS] inc {:a 1 :b 3 :c 42})
[18:39:16] <rovanion> ridcully_: Afraid not.
[18:42:00] <ridcully_> reduce over the keys and use contains?/update in the reducing-fn then?  if in doubt check what the useful library has to offer
[18:46:55] <ridcully_> well at first glance they offer nothing
[18:47:32] <lockdown_> rovanion: using loop/recur is probably going to be the fastest way

[20:41:43] <yeik-the-spik[m]> loled at the tech interview entries
[20:43:48] <yeik-the-spik[m]> on my last tech interview I was asked 3 questions: Do you know python for finance? Do you know unit tests? How long before you become productive with this codebase I am showing you on my screen?
[20:45:16] <Para> "Give me a copy and I'll get back to you."
[20:45:51] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Yeah, then the guy said it took him 3 days
[20:46:10] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Anyways, what is productive?
[20:46:15] <Para> I'm the kind of a nosey guy who would've deadpan replied "So?"
[20:46:17] <yeik-the-spik[m]> There is no documentation
[20:46:32] <yeik-the-spik[m]> so if I write documentation, am I productive?
[20:46:41] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I can be productive on minute 1
[20:46:57] <technomancy> "do you know unit tests" wait what
[20:47:08] <yeik-the-spik[m]> what is python for finance? How is it different from python for real estate
[20:47:14] <yeik-the-spik[m]> ?
[20:47:37] <logiz> I've personally shook hands with unit tests before, I'd say we're acquaintances
[20:48:46] <lunik1> the finance world can be so weird, backwards, and insular that I wouldn't be shocked if "python for finance" was a real thing
[20:49:27] <TimMc> you use dollar signs in all the variables
[20:51:34] <TimMc> I'm starting a job search, so I guess I should brush up on "unit test", "how do variable", and "github"
[20:51:38] <lunik1> it's python 3 syantax except print is still a statement
[20:52:42] <lunik1> have you ever passed containers in a busy corridor?
[20:55:47] <yeik-the-spik[m]> still waiting for the punchline
[20:57:46] <yeik-the-spik[m]> They were also insistent on modularization. So I asked if they had gone for the microservices architecture. I dont think they knew what I was talking about. Then the cto dropped from the call, and when he came back he asked me why would I ever want to change the architecture to microservices.

[21:12:22] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I am not saying that is what happened. But that is definitely how it felt like
[21:13:16] <TimMc> I mean, I had been thinking of picking a place that had really competent, well-informed people, but your offer is tempting.
[21:26:20] <sobel> technomancy: yeah that one caught me too
[21:27:02] <sobel> once upon a time, i knew this junior dev who got his first FT dev job, and it was in test/QA. but he was definitely hired to develop code in the unit test library, it was a coder position.
[21:27:15] <sobel> and all he did was bitch that it wasn't an app dev role, like he wanted.
[21:28:28] <sobel> when i was more giving toward this person, i tried to highlight the obvious fact: a coding job is a job in the right department, figure out mobility after you know the codebase.
[21:28:41] <sobel> he wasn't having it

[23:26:58] <v3ga> hmm, I have a weird little issue here.  I have a clojure app then i was using shadow-cljs for the frontend.  This morning I commented out the shadow-cljs code in deps.edn and added figwheel.  I started figwheel up successfully and I can see my apps ui but it's also still giving the cljs prompt at the bottom to reconnect
[23:27:26] <v3ga> do I need to completely get rid of my shadow-cljs.edn code, etc?
[23:46:18] <jeaye> May want to make sure you do a clean build.
[23:46:53] <jeaye> But I'd recommend sticking with shadow-cljs, rather than figwheel. I've used both quite a bit and shadow generally causes less frustration.
[23:47:52] <v3ga> jeaye: even if i'm not using npm packages?
[23:48:33] <jeaye> Yeah.
[23:48:41] <v3ga> i was kind of trying to remove moving pieces... but do tell. I was looking around trying to decide if I should stay with shadow or go to figwheel.  I'm all ears/eyes

[23:50:27] <jeaye> I've had better luck with repls with shadow. The configuration is simpler and it seems to do the right thing by default.
[23:51:00] <jeaye> If you have a reason for getting rid of it, that's ok. Maybe figwheel is better for you.
[23:51:18] <jeaye> I've used both for years, though; happy to be on shadow now.
[23:52:09] <v3ga> mostly just cleaner and everything in one nest vs fighting clj tools THEN jumping over to deal with NPM
[23:52:17] <v3ga> especially if I don't plan on using npm
[23:52:44] <jeaye> clj tools? Are you not using lein?
[23:53:02] <v3ga> clj 
[23:54:10] <jeaye> eeek, you like making things difficult for yourself.
[23:55:36] <jeaye> lein + shadow plugin and dep will keep things out of the way and allow you to just build your app.
[23:55:51] <jeaye> Or lein + figwheel, if you so desire.
[23:56:10] <v3ga> jeaye: lol i've noticed that. i've been using clj tools for a while now though and i'm pretty comfortable with it
[23:56:37] <jeaye> The CLJS stack is complex enough. Trying to use all of these things outside of lein is like learning to bake bread by building an oven.
[23:56:46] <v3ga> but yeah....i do take the difficult route habitually.  
[23:56:52] <v3ga> i've built my oven... with pedestal
[23:57:12] <v3ga> but the bread is bad o_O
