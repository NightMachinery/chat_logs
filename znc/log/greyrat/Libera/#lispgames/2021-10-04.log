[00:03:55] <dto> mp3 incoming
[00:04:08] <borodust> yay!
[00:04:24] <borodust> to both news :)
[00:04:45] <dto> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/KcL3IIm5/freakstyle-X-33.mp3
[00:04:46] <dto> needs a lot of editing
[00:05:32] * borodust looking
[00:06:20] <dto> i would not use most of this. you're hearing the raw output mixed in
[00:06:28] <dto> but SOME passages of color are nice
[00:06:52] <borodust> i pushed the fix for local libraries interference in the meantime :) thanks for the help!
[00:07:01] <dto> you're welcome :)
[00:15:45] <borodust> wait, the theme seems the same
[00:16:05] <borodust> only, like, elongated
[00:16:07] <borodust> stretched
[00:16:27] <dto> interesting. you mean similar chords?
[00:16:52] <borodust> hmm, more like same core, same structure
[00:16:55] <borodust> skeleton
[00:17:06] <dto> welllll 
[00:17:23] <dto> they both have A B A B but then this song has a third section C then A B again
[00:17:35] <dto> whereas the other song doesn't have a C section, it's just A B A B stop
[00:17:40] <dto> you mean overall? 
[00:17:50] <borodust> yes, overall
[00:18:02] <borodust> it ain't exactly the same ofc
[00:18:13] <borodust> at least that was my first impression
[00:18:21] <dto> i was hoping we'd have more melodic vocals in this one. we're still working on it
[00:18:36] <dto> i do want the tracks to be distinct from each other
[00:18:42] <borodust> this one feels more stretched and indeed freakish ;p
[00:20:47] <borodust> as in mood
[00:25:13] <dto> interesting.

[19:44:35] <asgas> I need a comparison of various lisp or scheme dialects for game scripting. The core will be in C, but I need advice on which lisp or scheme dialect to use. SBCL? Guile? The issue is how garbage collection will put a hit in performance.
[19:44:57] <thrig> in theory ECL could embed in C
[19:46:11] <asgas> Is garbage collection optional in ECL?
[19:46:16] <thrig> Fennel could be another option
[19:47:23] <Catie> I know under SBCL you can inhibit garbage collection, but I've never tried it and don't really know the ramifications of doing so
[19:48:37] <thrig> presumably you also aim at code that doesn't cons randomly

[19:52:27] <amirouche> there is used to be scheme with a "real time GC" but it is not maintained.
[19:52:35] <amirouche> I am not even sure what real-time GC mean.
[19:53:03] <amirouche> Also, it depends on the game and what part of the game will be scripted.
[19:53:44] <amirouche> It is not a game per se, but libfive has a core with c++ and the gui stuff is done with guile https://libfive.com/
[19:53:54] <amirouche> and it works.
[19:54:34] <amirouche> There is also a music app which gui is done with chiken, but all the audio processing is done with chicken.
[19:54:42] <amirouche> it really depends what you mean by "scripting"
[19:54:45] <dthompson> I highly recommend extending vs. embedding.
[19:55:01] <dthompson> write the app in a lisp. use C libraries when necessary via FFI.
[19:56:28] <amirouche> +1
[19:58:01] <asgas> Well I was thinking of the physics engine be in C and then script the game logic in a lisp or scheme dialect. 
[19:58:06] <asgas> Just as an example
[19:59:17] <dthompson> it could be flipped around: lisp for the core app that calls to a C library via FFI for physics calculations.
[19:59:21] <dthompson> just something to consider.
[20:00:08] <asgas> I'll keep that in mind dthompson. Thanks.
[20:00:14] <pjb> You can consider the code implemented in C as a co-processor. Like the GPU for the CPU.
[20:00:34] <dthompson> different approaches for different preferences.
[20:00:55] <asgas> Can I make a fast 3D opengl game entirely in scheme?
[20:01:16] <Catie> That's a pretty open-ended question
[20:01:24] <dthompson> for me, my ideal world is one where I can write 100% of the code in my preferred lisp.  so I write in lisp first and use C libraries where the ideal doesn't match current reality.
[20:01:42] <Catie> dthompson: hard agree
[20:01:55] <asgas> Right. So really advanced physics math stuff in C. The rest in lisp/scheme.
[20:02:14] <dthompson> but I know that some people *only* want lisp involved for some high level scripting, so that approach doesn't suit them.
[20:02:23] <dthompson> no wrong answer here.
[20:02:42] <thrig> the egg obviously should be broken at the big end
[20:02:43] <Jach> It seems strange to bootstrap the game from the physics engine. You could make a fast 3D game in just about anything if it's calling out to fast graphics libs (opengl or higher level like ogre) and physics libs (havok, bullet, ..)
[20:03:42] <dthompson> asgas: the short answer to your question is "yes"
[20:04:22] <pjb> For example, if you have a nVidia DPX at your disposal, your game can still be written in lisp, but of course you will send stuff to the DPX to process 3D.  Similarly you can send stuff to a C library (it may implement a virtual GPU).
[20:08:07] <borodust> asgas: if you want to use C from Common Lisp - SBCL is good, shipping a game is a bit painful but doable
[20:08:31] <borodust> asgas: if you want Common Lisp from C - ECL is good enough
[20:09:11] <borodust> shipping for the latter is easy, if you have C/C++ shipping machinery ready
[20:11:15] <asgas> Thanks for the advice. I think I have an idea of what I want without reinventing the wheel.
