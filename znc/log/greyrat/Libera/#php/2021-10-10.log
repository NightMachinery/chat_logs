[00:31:03] <entropy_> is there a isnum operator in PHP? like: if (this isnum 1-15) { do this } ?
[00:31:39] <Blondie101010> entropy_:  that example looks like you don't know the PHP syntax
[00:32:11] <Blondie101010> it looks a bit like JS but also invalid in any sane programming language

[00:40:12] <rambleba1> Eugen80, PHPStorm has an option called s.th. along the line of stop at first line hit (i guess)ctrl + shift + a and type in first line, enable it
[00:41:10] <Eugen80> rambleba1: it is enabled
[00:41:17] <rambleba1> next configure your xdebug set the session-id to some value, let PHPStorm know what this value is. Expose port 9000 on the container
[00:41:39] <rambleba1> Look for an xdebug extension to your browser
[00:41:49] <rambleba1> set the value for this extension as well and enable it
[00:41:59] <rambleba1> the tricky part is the Routing
[00:42:21] <Eugen80> everything seems to be done, but port 9000 is not exposed
[00:42:28] <rambleba1> Xdebug has an option of automatically detecting the remote host that needs to be enabled as well
[00:43:16] <rambleba1> well there are 2 options you can go about this with PHPStorm, one goes over the network, the other uses the local port 9000
[00:43:36] <rambleba1> that is the phone-icon you see in the upper bar, enable that as well
[00:45:32] <Eugen80> let me check port 9000... I have two workstations, on A one debugging is working, on B not. If I check the docker-compost.yml file on A, I don't see any port 9000
[00:46:56] <rambleba1> As I said, you can do this via the network as well
[00:47:25] <rambleba1> I tend to use local port 9000 these days, just expose it and ssh into a box or port-forward right away
[00:48:46] <Blondie101010> other than exposing it in docker, no port forward should be needed in a dev set up
[00:48:50] <Gamara> hey I am trying to set up an http server (to do sessions etc) with php-fpm, nginx and docker-compose and I keep getting an error https://pastebin.com/9k9KUDQM
[00:49:55] <rambleba1> Blondie101010 unless your dev machine is a remote box :D wouldn't be the first time I have seen devs mount complex setups via sshfs on their local machines edit it and commit it to the repository for further inspection
[00:50:22] <Blondie101010> Gamara:  "php" is obviously not a hostname
[00:50:29] <Blondie101010> so just fix that
[00:50:49] <Gamara>         location ~ \.php$ {
[00:50:52] <Gamara> this line?
[00:51:12] <Blondie101010> no, the one erroring is the fastcgi_pass line
[00:51:23] <Gamara> oh i see
[00:51:25] <Gamara> sorry im a noob
[00:51:50] <Gamara> i should read the manual
[00:52:17] <Blondie101010> looking at examples could help, like https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/phpfcgi/
[00:53:00] <Gamara> so it would be fastcgi_pass http-server:9000
[00:53:33] <Eugen80> my xdebug.ini: https://pastebin.com/9z1J8Cz6
[00:54:40] <Blondie101010> if http-server was the php-fpm address it would work, but that doesn't make much sense
[00:56:37] <rambleba1> Eugen80, first of, configure PHPStorm to use port 9009 it is also that way in the xdebug config and make change to compose as well
[00:57:49] <Eugen80> oh, now it is working.. i have 3 docker containers: php, www and redis. I took now the IP of www container and it is working
[00:57:49] <rambleba1> Also Eugen80, are you using xdebug 2 or 3
[00:57:57] <Eugen80> xdebug2
[01:01:21] <rambleba1> k just an FYI, xdebug is not maintained any more, remove the remote_host and use xdebug.remote_enable = true in its stead
[01:01:44] <rambleba1> that way we can try to eliminate the routing by letting xdebug take care of it
[01:03:48] <rambleba1> Eugen80, also just to make sure, xdebug is installed, and enabled on the PHPImage? If so and the configuration is still not working, put xdebug_dump_superglobals() : in your index.php and call it

[04:37:51] <jargon> -.-
[04:37:53] <__adrian> you're trying to programatically determine what the code does and transform it to the new language. this is parsing. regex is not good for parsing (most) programming languages, as they're not regular.
[04:37:53] <Blondie101010> there are many ways
[04:38:04] <jargon> It isn't parsing./
[04:38:34] <jargon> It is just changing up the header and footer of functions.

[04:38:44] <__adrian> it would be very helpful to your efforts if you realized it _was_, but i won't argue.
[04:39:03] <jargon> It is a simple search and replace using a pattern.
[04:39:17] <__adrian> if you're trying to figure out the regex, recommend #regex

[07:50:02] <__adrian> no. look at https://php.net/imagecreatefrombmp
[07:50:09] <__adrian> it says "php 8".
[07:50:49] <__adrian> look at that man page and see what section it's in. imagecreatefrombmp() is part of the GD extension. if it's not defined, the most likely explaination is you didn't install GD.
[07:52:16] <jargon> How do I install it?
[07:52:40] <__adrian> on xampp? no idea. !+xampp
[07:52:40] <php-bot> on xampp? no idea., Don’t use XAMPP or WAMP. Use a real dev server on a VM, docker, or WSL2. Install docker and check out https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/docker-php-example
[07:53:18] <__adrian> from there, depending on the distro you chose, it would likely be in a package named something like  php8.0-gd
[07:53:32] <__adrian> for xampp, you'd need to ask on a xampp channel/forum/etc.

[08:18:41] <Rockwood> __adrian, ah okay sorry to interrupt you
[08:24:09] <jargon> This code literally uses the swap, why? https://pastebin.com/ppi6hGdR
[08:24:50] <Blondie101010> clarify your idea please
[08:25:13] <Blondie101010> if you mean that the computer swaps, this would be related to the memory usage
[08:25:31] <Blondie101010> images can take a lot of RAM
[08:25:53] <jargon> I mean the filename reassignment.,
[08:26:12] <Blondie101010> can't imagine that using much RAM
[08:26:24] <Blondie101010> how did you come to that conclusion?
[08:26:28] <jargon> I'm talking about preg_replace
[08:26:52] <Blondie101010> you have a script that does image manipulations which would require a lot of RAM and you ask about the RAM usage of something that barely uses it
[08:27:09] <jargon> That's not what I meant by swap.
[08:27:33] <Blondie101010> then again please the question
[08:27:36] <Blondie101010> I don't get it
[08:28:01] <jargon> https://pastebin.com/ppi6hGdR  Why is the replacement taken literally in this preg_replace?
[08:28:39] <__adrian> the  $prefix  part? what do you expect it to be?
[08:29:01] <Blondie101010> ahhh, the named capture group
[08:29:04] <jargon> The name of a bitmap image.
[08:29:09] <jargon> Yes.
[08:29:28] <__adrian> no - in terms of code. do you think that's a variable, or a backreference?
[08:29:38] <__adrian> (hint: it's neither)
[08:32:57] <jargon> :) then what is it?
[08:33:05] <jargon> a group?
[08:33:17] <__adrian> it's a literal string, $prefix
[08:33:24] <jargon> :O
[08:33:37] <__adrian> what do you expect/want?
[08:34:07] <jargon> How do I use it as a group name?
[08:34:23] <__adrian> you cannot have a group name in a replacement. that doesn't make sense.
[08:34:32] <__adrian> do you want a _backreferencve_ ?
[08:34:36] <__adrian> *backreference
[08:34:49] <jargon> What is a back reference?
[08:35:17] <__adrian> it refers to a captured subpattern
[08:35:31] <__adrian> please answer: what is it that you want/expect this code to do?
[08:35:59] <jargon> To rename the file names from *.bmp to *.png
[08:36:15] <Blondie101010> then why not do that?
[08:36:35] <__adrian> so you think that '$prefix' will refer to whatever was captured in your pattern with  '(?<prefix>.*)'  ?
[08:36:42] <jargon> It is supposed to do so as a new file.
[08:37:27] <jargon> I take my life day to day, I suffer from past head trauma, life is like quantum leap for me.
[08:37:46] <Blondie101010> how about `str_replace(".bmp", ".png", $toc[$toc_index]);`?
[08:37:49] <__adrian> please answer - i can't help you if you don't.
[08:38:12] <jargon> $toc is the table of contents captured by fasttoc

[15:53:28] *** Joins: genomc (uid245282@id-245282.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[15:55:20] <olle> It would be nice to have a rule so that "complexit is not allowed to increase" in the CI, too.
[15:56:50] <olle> But that would require keeping track on each file's history :d
[16:04:25] <biberu> olle: how much are you spending on training vs looking for tools? ^^
[16:05:44] <olle> biberu: Training my colleagues? I've had 30 min lectures going through the quality guide I wrote this year.
[16:05:53] <olle> biberu: Here: https://manual.limesurvey.org/Code_quality_guide
[16:06:13] <olle> If I change the CI, I'll have small lectures about that too, so people can object if they so wish ^^
[16:08:05] <biberu> how well would you internalize the ideas that lead to that guide when presented in that way?
[16:46:26] <olle> biberu: internalize in the team?

[16:57:57] <biberu> olle: for an individual dev, i don't know how you are doing the lectures, maybe they are good, but I'd expect mixed success with a guide
[17:00:58] <olle> biberu: I take a section of the guide, and then I explain what's going on.
[17:01:21] <olle> Also part of on-boarding is going through this doc together
[17:01:28] <biberu> olle: i generally try to get ideas across when pair programming, reviewing something together, hoping that they'll help to improve on and spread them
[17:02:14] <olle> biberu: Sure, that's another way.
[17:02:29] <olle> One can even refer to the guide during code review
[17:04:15] <biberu> i don't mind repeating myself
[17:04:24] <biberu> we've learned to make fire many times
[17:07:23] <olle> We have outside contributors too, however. No way to teach them.

[23:48:26] <dag> interesting 10 year old reddit comment: "If you (like me) are concerned about marrying your company to a framework that will continue to be actively maintained indefinitely, I think there's really only one sensible choice in the PHP market, and that's Zend Framework."
[23:53:30] <ramblebamble> Zend still a thing?
[23:53:50] <ramblebamble> I have only used it to use some of their packages before the takeoff of composer
[23:53:52] <AllenJB> ZendFramework technically lives on as Laminas
[23:54:51] <ramblebamble> Intersting thanks
[23:57:56] <jargon> Does the US Military still use Xengine?
[23:58:49] <dag> AllenJB: true. some work needed for the transition though. no king rules forever
