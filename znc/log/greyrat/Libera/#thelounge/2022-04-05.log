[16:17:20] <jess> i'm trying to get our infrastructure people to talk about webirc because that'll solve the problem well
[16:20:53] <bookworm> so as far as we can do anything... sit tight for the moment?
[16:21:35] <jess> yeah.
[16:21:43] <jess> i hope to have an answer today
[16:21:53] <bookworm> we already hash the ip (assuming ipv4 that is) with hexip and set that as the ident... so banning a single ip host should be feasible by banning the ident
[16:22:07] <bookworm> rather than the whole demo
[16:22:16] <bookworm> then again, add tor and well ...
[16:22:27] <bookworm> we could ban the tor ranges on our end
[16:23:05] <bookworm> thanks a lot for your consideration btw, much appreciated

[19:10:55] <jess> bookworm: around?
[19:11:40] <bookworm> kinda, at work currently so my responses might be delayed
[19:12:24] <jess> is ok. do i understand that thelounge is able to act as a bouncer? if so; 2 questions. 1) does webirc use the IP that initiated the connection? 2) is this feature disabled for demo.thelounge.chat?
[19:13:47] *** Joins: PipeItToDevNull0 (~PipeItToD@user/pipeittodevnull)
[19:13:55] <bookworm> webirc needs server cooperation, meaning a shared password. It then "spoofs" the remote IP and the server has to trust that the bouncer doesn't do malicious stuff with that. It's a trust thing essentially. But yes, webIRC identifies the remote IP https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/webirc.html
[19:14:22] <bookworm> s/spoof/sends/
[19:14:24] <jess> i know what webirc does
[19:14:38] <jess> when you behave as a bouncer, multiple client IPs can connect to the same bouncer
[19:14:51] <jess> the bouncer has to pick which one of those client IPs are sent to the server via webirc
[19:15:00] <bookworm> ah, I see, sorry.
[19:15:03] <jess> is oki

[19:21:52] <jess> i'm interested what would happen if you enabled both bouncer mode and webirc. what IP would thelounge pick to send through webirc?
[19:22:07] <jess> but that question is mostly irrelevant if we don't need to consider it for demo.thelounge.chat
[19:24:20] <bookworm> the one IP that initiates the actual IRC connection in the first place, it happens on network creation
[19:24:44] <bookworm> at least as far as me reading the code for 5min can tell
[19:25:27] <jess> ahh that makes sense
[19:25:28] <jess> thanks!
[19:25:39] <bookworm> what it does on restart once it's fully configured and then restarted, no idea
[19:25:55] <bookworm> but yes, not relevant for the demo
[19:26:15] <bookworm> that's essentially killing any upstream IRC connection as soon as the client (TL) goes away
