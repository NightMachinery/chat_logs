[14:40:16] <interop_madness> If NATO gets involved, the war WILL become thermonuclear. That's 100% certain. Russia can't even hope to win a conventional war against NATO. The only option they have is strategic nuclear warfare.
[14:40:31] <lancehead> or cyber 
[14:41:27] <Joe-Developer> putin has pretty much said anyone who gets involved will be nuked
[14:41:54] <lancehead> That was before China expressed support though, if the Chinese get involved with the Russians they definitely do have a chance 
[14:44:11] <lancehead> Especially if they start drafting people, which let's be honest they will
