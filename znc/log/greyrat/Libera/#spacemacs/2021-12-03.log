[01:58:38] <FromGitter> <YaZko> Hello everyone. I am having troubles with loading a layer: I'm trying to use the `coq` layer for the coq proof assistant, and simply add `coq` to my `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` to this end.  ‚èé This layer seems to come with the two usual main packages: `proof-general`, and `company-coq`. What I do not understand is that the former gets installed and loaded smoothly, but the latter does not. It is as if the 
[01:58:38] <FromGitter> ... `coq/init-company-coq` function is not run. Would anyone know if I am missing something obvious? ‚èé The definition of the layer in master is here: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/layers/%2Blang/coq/packages.el
[02:00:08] <FromGitter> <YaZko> To be clear, the observed behaviour is that `company-coq` is simply not installed at all (no function in scope if I M-x), and the bindings defined in `coq/init-company-coq` not bound. But I get no error nor warning, and the proof-general part works perfectly.

[08:05:28] <FromGitter> <sthysel> G'day, did a develop update today and this started happening: `Error (use-package): forge/:catch: End of file during parsing: /home/thys/.emacs.d/elpa/27.2/develop/forge-20211203.132/forge.el`. Manual removal of forge-20211203.132 and having spacemacs re-install leads to the same. Any tips on resolving ?
[08:10:27] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @YaZko Have you tried putting `print` statements in the function and press `SPC f e R` (then check your messages buffer using `SPC b m`)
[08:14:59] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Thanks! Sounds interesting, will keep this in mind...
[08:19:44] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Beside some weird defaults in GNOME, e.g. not coming with gnome-tweaks, and the kstatusnotifier extension by default, I find gnome very elegant and I have experienced no bugs. Now that I speak about it, you should really 'remap' your `CAPS-LOCK` key to `ESC` using in `additional layouts` under `keyboard and mouse in gnome tweaks...
[08:25:29] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I would expect things would work on a fresh KDE instal also b.t.w., but the gardens look better in the land of gnomes...
