[01:01:45] <konubinix> Hi there. I maintain a braindump exporting several org roam files using ox-hugo
[01:02:02] <konubinix> https://konubinix.eu/braindump/posts/the_brain_of_konubinix/
[01:02:30] <konubinix> There are corrently 2536 files in there
[01:04:09] <konubinix> I generally run a emacs script that checks what compares the org files and the .md files and generate the .md files that need to be updated and get rids of the .md that need to be removed
[01:05:51] <konubinix> This incremental update allow not going througn the long time of generating everything everytimes
[01:06:29] <konubinix> Today, I decided to clean everything and regenerate the whole stuff again
[01:06:45] <konubinix> I realized emacs crashes from time to time
[01:07:03] <konubinix> With a segmentation fault
[01:07:40] <konubinix> Running the incremental update makes it go a bit further and then it crashes again
[01:08:03] <konubinix> The stack trace is not helpful, as emacs is not built in debug mode
[01:08:24] <konubinix> It look lile this
[01:08:24] <konubinix> /usr/bin/emacs(+0x18bc8e)[0x55aecba90c8e]
[01:09:01] <konubinix> Then, I can generate a few hundred .md files bettween each crash
[01:09:44] <konubinix> The fact it does not crash on a specific file makes me think it has to do with all the files that are open at the same time
[01:10:39] <konubinix> Does a similar behavior (crashing when opening/exporting a few hundred of files) ring a bell to anyone?
[01:11:30] <konubinix> Great, it just finished. So I can still generate my braindumpfrom scratch, but it now involves something like 10 crash and rerun
[01:13:24] <konubinix> Because of the incremental build (I barely change hundreds of files between each build), I barely see the crash. Therefore, it is not a big deal. But it is kind of troubling (intellectually)
