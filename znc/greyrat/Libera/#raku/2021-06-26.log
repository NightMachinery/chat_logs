[04:34:22] <japhb> raydiak: If I'm going to be doing a lot of DOM building, I'd probably want something a bit more fluent than that (the Pod API you demonstrated).  Though I suppose I could just layer the simpler interface on top of the existing API.

[04:42:59] <raydiak> sounds like a good approach. I often wrap my external dependencies anyway right off the bat, just in case something changes upstream, or I have to work around a bug, or whatever. clear separation, and all that
[04:45:33] <raydiak> plus then later if you decide you don't like Pod, want to use some other thing or write your own, you can just change the backend code of your wrapper instead of having Pod:: stuff strewn everywhere in the codebase

[05:00:05] <raydiak> and if you really want to get fancy, it lets you detect and use the modules you prefer out of what's installed, or give downstream users a way to choose between backends, stuff like that. likely overkill for your use case, idk what you're doing precisely. but cool nonetheless. abstractions make me happy

[05:15:06] <japhb> Yeah, I habitually set up an abstraction layer for persistence, but it's a decent point about making one for doc building
[05:15:24] <japhb> Kinda makes me wonder what the pandoc DOM looks like
[05:17:40] <moon-child> japhb: curious, what is this for?
[05:22:34] <japhb> moon-child: For MUGS, in order to separate out semantics and layout in descriptions, rules, help screens, etc.
[05:23:43] <RandalSchwartz> japhb? :)
[05:23:45] <japhb> Because I need to be able to make content versus UI toolkit versus localization not be a really painful thing
[05:23:50] <RandalSchwartz> is that the backup japh? :)
[05:24:10] <moon-child> japhb: it sounds like what you want is a general scene graph and ui toolkit, with text layout as just one aspect of that
[05:24:30] <japhb> RandalSchwartz: Not the same as japhy, no.  It's a play on my actual name, and the fact that I've been doing Perl family languages since perl4.  :-)
[05:25:06] <RandalSchwartz> Me too, and then some. :)
[05:25:30] <japhb> moon-child: Eventually, yes ... but scene graph is often specific to games that have some sort of "environment".  I'm also supporting fully abstract games.
[05:25:49] <RandalSchwartz> I remember downloading perl 1 as a 60-part "sharchive".  Anyone else remember those?
[05:26:00] <japhb> RandalSchwartz: Oh, I know.  :-)
[05:26:07] <moon-child> japhb: well, ok, widget graph

[05:26:45] <moon-child> 2d/3d layout is distinct, and layout itself is not essential; you're right.  But if you have 2d layout tools, you want to be able to use them generally, not just for text
[05:27:11] <japhb> moon-child: Yes, I will need that.  It's on my list.  I was kinda hoping that the research that vrurg++ was doing a few months ago would get me that on the front end, but apparently that ran into trouble that needed Jonathan-level work to improve.
[05:27:54] <japhb> moon-child: Agreed.
[05:28:28] <japhb> RandalSchwartz: sharchives -- yes, I remember them.  I'm glad I only had to deal with them briefly.  :-)
[05:29:14] <moon-child> I ran into shar fairly recently, doing some code archeology
[05:29:26] <japhb> (Actually, come to think of it, there was the spiritual cousin of them used at a company that I used to work at.  That was ... weird.)
[05:29:56] <moon-child> gog uses effectively shar for their linux games

[05:31:11] <RandalSchwartz> sharchives solved the "maximum usenet post size" quite nicely
[05:31:47] * japhb once worked at a company that did a usenet-to-web gateway
[05:32:56] <japhb> Turns out some people had figured out how to stream video directly into usenet, and decode it on the way out.  There were even people who fed wild satellite feeds into Usenet, though we pretty much avoided that particular corner like the plague.
[05:33:12] <japhb> "How to piss off media lawyers, in one easy step!"
[05:33:21] <moon-child> whaaat
[05:33:26] <moon-child> how did you handle the latency?
[05:34:08] <japhb> To be clear: We didn't.  Just being in the industry, I knew about them.  And it turns out that (at the time at least) Usenet feeds pushed a LOT of bandwidth comparitively.
[05:34:29] <japhb> Enough that watching a feed probably just had you on a few minutes time delay, anywhere in the world.
[05:34:47] <japhb> Well, anywhere that had access to a full-speed Usenet feed.
[05:36:24] <japhb> It was a classic "Provide any technical tool, and people will figure out how to make it run Doom and watch cat videos"
[05:37:33] <moon-child> :D

[13:25:21] <chronon> I used to have access to Usenet back in the day when ISPs all had an NNTP server. I miss it and if there was some way I could access Usenet again, I'd want to participate again.
[13:25:26] <chronon> Do people here still use Usenet in some form and, if so, by what method could I regain access to Usenet?
[13:26:15] <moon-child> eternal-september.org and aioe.org
[13:26:42] <moon-child> (the former is faster and its archives go back further, but it requires you to register an account; pick your poison :)

[13:41:05] <chronon> I suppose my next off-topic question has to be, which good curses mode Usenet readers should I use?
[13:41:27] <moon-child> I use alpine
[13:41:53] <moon-child> but alpine kinda sucks.  And is crashy.  And it takes forever to sort things
[13:42:24] <moon-child> there's also gnus, which is nice if you like emacs, but I think it's also slow as all hell
[13:43:19] <chronon> I'm rather stuck on vim key bindings. I wonder which one would fit my muscle memory best.
[13:43:45] <chronon> I see there is trn4, slrn, and maybe mutt can do NNTP too?
[13:44:08] <moon-child> I was thinking at one point of doing my own mail/news reader in raku
[13:44:17] <moon-child> I want to get away from hierarchical organization
[13:44:19] <chronon> That would be SO cool.
[13:44:30] <moon-child> and none of the existing clients are set up for that
[13:44:47] <chronon> What do you mean by hierarchical in this context?
[13:45:42] <moon-child> an email client organizes data elements (emails) hierarchically (directory a > directory b > some message)
[13:45:54] <moon-child> the problem is that that hierarchy is fixed
[13:46:21] <chronon> What are you proposing as an improvement?
[13:46:31] <moon-child> what if I want to do directory b > directory a > some message?
[13:47:19] <chronon> Surely B is a sub category of A if it has been created that way? What would be the reason for reversing it?
[13:47:43] <moon-child> well that's the thing, usually you don't have 'subcategories'
[13:48:02] <moon-child> what if a is the year 2017 and b is messages sent to the raku mailing list
[13:48:15] <chronon> Are yu referring to Usenet or something else now? Usenet is rather hierarchiallly organised.
[13:48:38] <moon-child> I might want to look at _all_ messages sent in 2017, or I might want to look at _all_ messages sent to the raku mailing list
[13:48:45] <moon-child> (or some other mailing list, etc.)
[13:48:56] <chronon> Oh so you want some kind of tagging system like Gmail then?
[13:49:21] <moon-child> tagging system--kinda.  (Don't know what gmail does.)  I want to be able to create arbitrary hierarchies on the fly from tag categories
[13:51:03] <chronon> Gmail taggin is pretty flexible. I had to use Gmail for work a few years back. I try not to touch anything Google outside of work. I cannot now remember if it was possible to drag the tags around into a hierarchy on the fly, but I do remember being quite impressed with it.
[13:51:10] <moon-child> usenet itself is hierarchical.  But there's no reason I shouldn't be able to grab all the messages and enforce my own hierarchy :)
[13:51:34] <chronon> Perhaps you should experiment with Gmail's tagging before designing your own, just in case there are some good ideas worth stealing.
[13:52:28] <moon-child> I'll take a look
[13:53:57] <chronon> Oh and sign me up for beta testing your tagged fluid-hierarchy Raku Usenet reader. :)
[13:55:06] <moon-child> heh, don't count on it; I have an endless supply of back-burner-yet-to-be-implemented projects
[13:56:07] <chronon> I think that's just the fundamental condition of life as a coder.

[15:44:38] <whatnext> hello all :)   nice noob question for you. What do you think is the best way to iterate backwards over an array? Say with each iteration I want the index of the item in the original array (rather than the index in the reversed array) - ie it should go e.g. 9,8,7 rather than 0,1,2. Thoughts? :)  
[15:51:28] <El_Che> whatnext: reverse
[15:51:35] <El_Che> n
[15:51:36] <El_Che> n
[15:52:05] <El_Che> evalable6: my @a=1,2,3; say @a.reverse;
[15:52:06] <evalable6> El_Che, rakudo-moar dba9f56af: OUTPUT: «(3 2 1)␤»
[15:53:21] <whatnext> ok I thought of reverse but I assumed the index would come out the opposite. ie if I did @arr.reverse.kv I'd get 0,1,2 for the index
[15:54:05] *** Joins: _ed (~ed@c-73-54-198-101.hsd1.ga.comcast.net)
[15:54:10] <El_Che> maybe I misunderstood the question
[15:57:26] <whatnext> I think `for @arr.reverse.kv -> $k, $v {` would give me the right order of $v, but $k would be the opposite to what I want? Obviously I could get the right value by subtracting from the length, but I just wondered if there was a more straightforward way

[16:00:48] <ugexe> sort by value descending 
[16:02:14] <ugexe> m: my %h = a => 100, b => 50, c => 1; say %h.sort(*.value)
[16:02:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar dba9f56af: OUTPUT: «(c => 1 b => 50 a => 100)␤»
[16:05:31] <whatnext> sorry, I just meant counting backwards from the end of an array (rather than a hash), keeping the index numbers of the original array
[16:12:12] <lizmat> please note that .reverse on a reified array just  creates an iterator that walks backward, it doesn't do any copying
[16:15:04] <whatnext> lizmat - you mean $k would count down?
[16:15:15] <lizmat> no
[16:15:55] <lizmat> because the .kv doesn't know what type of iterator is its source
[16:16:21] <lizmat> so as far as it is concernred, it's just moving forward, so $k would be starting at 0
[16:17:37] <lizmat> m: my @a = ^10; for ^@a .reverse { .say }   # perhaps that's a way ?
[16:17:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar dba9f56af: OUTPUT: «9␤8␤7␤6␤5␤4␤3␤2␤1␤0␤»
[16:18:02] <lizmat> afaik that will actually highly optimize the for loop as well
[16:19:50] <lizmat> m: my @a = "a" .. "j"; for @a.pairs.reverse -> (:$key, :$value) { say "$key: $value"    # another way

[16:20:05] <whatnext> isn't this still the values that are being reversed?
[16:20:39] <lizmat> that actually creates a Seq of pairs, and then walks it in reverse order
[16:20:50] <lizmat> there's copying going on in that case :-)
[16:21:38] <whatnext> ah `pairs` I didn't look at that
[16:22:51] <whatnext> yes that looks like it might work (y)

[20:23:12] <polettix> MasterDuke: I think I got it - putting &!foo in BUILD's signature forces overwriting the default with a "null" value, which later triggers the error message
