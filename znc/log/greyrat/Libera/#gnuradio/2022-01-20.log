[08:07:36] <aaknitt[m]> Hi everyone.  Trying to figure out the correct/best way to change parameters of a block (for example, the frequency of a Signal Source block) from an external program via UDP (or something similar).  I can change the parameters programmatically in Python, but I'm unsure how to pipe in UDP packets that contain the values that I want to change the parameters to without breaking the flowgraph operation.  I don't think I can just use the
[08:07:36] <aaknitt[m]> typical socket calls in Python that I'd normally use, as those will block and mess up the flowgraph.  I'm sure there's a way to do this but I'm still trying to wrap my head around PDUs and PMTs and how to correctly integrate "normal" Python code with flowgraph operation.

[15:40:56] <JDemel[m]> A question for language experts, should I prefer:
[15:40:56] <JDemel[m]> "transmit and receive antennas", or
[15:40:56] <JDemel[m]> "transmitter and receiver antennas"?
[15:40:56] <JDemel[m]> I've seen both. Which version would you prefer?
[15:42:35] <marvinXP> The former sounds to me like the set of antennas that as they are connected now can act as either tx or rx. But hey, English is my second language.
[15:44:58] <JoshMorman[m]> I think the former is more standard - at least that's how I've always seen it written.
[15:47:13] <funkylab[m]> yeah, it also describes more of the *job* of these antennas, the second version more of a possessive property of the antennas. A "receive antenna" will receive, but a "receiver antenna" is just the antenna installed in a device considered to be a receiver (and that's a lot more vague)
[15:53:06] <JDemel[m]> Thanks for your answers!
[15:53:06] <JDemel[m]> I stumbled across this during a discussion with a linguist about a text I wrote. It's fascinating to learn about language sometimes. And of course, it can be very helpful.
