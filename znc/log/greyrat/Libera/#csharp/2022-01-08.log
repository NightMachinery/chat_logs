I am generating frames to send to a laser on the fly / indefinitely using the yield operator, but the problem is since i need to load a buffer and wait for it to deplete before taking new points from the IEnumerable, i get a new IEnumerable returned so the playback restarts at 0
[07:57:14] <Brett[Air]> So how could i keep a reference to the current position of the enumerable? https://gist.github.com/Bfindlay/7e2c332cf6835f627febb2ee20d26fdc

[08:13:07] <Slade> Brett[Air], are you familiar with Observables?
[08:13:52] <Brett[Air]> in the case of Angular rxjs yes, but never really used observables in c#
[08:14:48] <Slade> push vs pull, similar concept
[08:17:11] <Slade> is your problem line 11 Brett[Air] ?
[08:17:42] <Brett[Air]> yeah
[08:18:07] <Brett[Air]> After that, the "New generator" line gets called and i see the replay restart at 0
[08:18:49] <Brett[Air]> Which i now see is the expected behaviour of an iterator
[08:19:03] <Slade> c# Rx has BufferWithCount..  really the problem is you cant use Take
[08:22:29] <Slade> your cheapest way is to foreach on it. put those into List until its pointCap in size, send the buffer, continue

[12:44:26] <MatthiasVance> Is there a good way to track your LEGO sets etc?
[12:44:35] <MatthiasVance> There is this LEGO app for instructions but it can't find half the stuff
[12:46:27] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, there must be, last time I met with friends we talked about that stuff. there's a whole niche industry about refurbished lego-sets and sites with custom models and info about sets you have to own to build. btw. its mostly done by males  of the age > 30 :)
[12:46:53] *** Joins: diophantoz (~diophanto@user/diophantoz)
[12:46:56] <MatthiasVance> Yeah there are really amazing sets if you're into LEGO. I am not as much but enjoy building with my son.
[12:47:30] <MatthiasVance> Shit is expensive too
[12:47:47] <MichaelLong> a friend of a friend has a side business: he collects old lego-sets or parts of sets and re-assembles them after cleaning etc.
[12:49:08] <MichaelLong> my guess brickset.com is the most popular one
[12:51:20] <MichaelLong> but it is also not for me, the time to play with LEGO was over after 12-13 :D
[12:52:16] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I like constructing things, preferably with an interactive result (software? :P) .. so after I finished building it one time I'm done

[14:31:37] <_genuser_> but then I can log in to libera from kiwiirc online client.
[14:32:14] <_genuser_> so I'm thinking the it's not a ban by nick, which means I didn't spam, which is also true. Assuming then that thelounge client itself was banned due to someone spamming from it. maybe

[16:10:07] <MatthiasVance> So not logging in anywhere during 3-6 months
[16:13:38] <_genuser_> probably that's it. I mean I don't need the account, but apparently they think checking out a free license is the best innovation since sliced bread. So they demand an account. But obviously the account is not used for anything else. So next cycle it's locked. They should probably check out licenses faster or increase inactivity time on the
[16:13:39] <_genuser_> accounts. Technically I saw inactivity time is 2 years. But doesn't seem to be the real deal.

[22:11:51] <bpmedley> cerl : You earlier question about native elf programs.. do you think NativeAOT will be something you might like?
[22:12:07] <bpmedley> Although, NativeAOT is not production ready yet, I don't think.
[22:12:32] <cerl> It's not a big deal anymore. I'm going to use unity or something like that with C#, so I don't think I have a choice in the matter on the output format.

[22:23:46] <JakeSays> cerl: .net runs native on linux now and has for a while
[22:24:05] <JakeSays> and yes, it's bad practice to put multiple types in the same file.
[22:24:33] <cerl> Can I keep using regular GNU make to compile a project? Don't want to relearn cake or whatever the popular build system is for .NET when I could just keep using make.
[22:24:56] <JakeSays> you could but it'd be far more trouble that it's worth
[22:25:14] <JakeSays> the build system for .net is msbuild
[22:26:33] <JakeSays> cerl: why are you using unity? writing games?
[22:27:07] <cerl> Well of course unity. Or possibly godot. For video games. C# seems to be the right tool for the job right now.
[22:27:14] <cerl> I mean of course for video games.
[22:28:43] *** Quits: Diablo-D3 (foobar@exelion.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:28:55] <cerl> If C# isn't supposed to be like java, why is it then trying to use Main() outside of a class giving me a compiler error? I'm on mono right now if that changes things.
[22:29:26] *** Joins: Diablo-D3 (foobar@exelion.net)
[22:29:52] <JakeSays> cerl: who said c# isn't supposed to be like java?
[22:30:23] <JakeSays> they're both languages - you need to learn the language you're trying to use
[22:30:42] <Suchiman> cerl: because C# isn't C
[22:31:26] <Suchiman> although if you're using a recent C# you can have top level statements...
[22:31:33] <JakeSays> gross
[22:31:44] <Suchiman> cerl: https://www.claudiobernasconi.ch/2020/12/03/csharp-9-top-level-statements/#:~:text=Top-level%20statements%20allow%20us%20to%20write%20C%23%20statements,C%23%20project%20type%20has%20the%20same%20entry%20point.
[22:31:52] <cerl> mono is on C#8 right now.
[22:32:11] <JakeSays> cerl: your mono might be, but i'm pretty sure current mono is on c# 9

[23:21:32] <JakeSays> Suchiman: i'm adding gps to my $1MM clock
[23:22:13] <Suchiman> JakeSays: sounds like you'll not be staying within budget
[23:22:36] <JakeSays> LOL the budget went out the window years ago
[23:23:08] <Suchiman> JakeSays: is that so you can find the clock again when you rage throw it out of the window?
[23:23:38] <JakeSays> LOL it's so it will keep the correct time zone when i travel
[23:23:46] <Nasp> What clock?
[23:24:22] <JakeSays> Nasp: the clock i've been building for years
[23:24:29] <Nasp> What kind?=
[23:24:39] <JakeSays> i have about $500 in parts, $1MM-$500 in time invested
[23:25:26] <Nasp> MM?
[23:25:32] <Nasp> 1 million million?
[23:25:50] <JakeSays> MM is million in the financial world
[23:25:55] <JakeSays> er, MN
[23:26:04] <JakeSays> no, MM
[23:26:08] <JakeSays> fuck one of those
[23:26:26] <Nasp> Are you sure ? :D
[23:26:42] <JakeSays> it's MM
[23:27:12] *** Joins: kuahara (kuahara@072-182-135-032.res.spectrum.com)
[23:27:34] <Nasp> So roman numerals?
[23:27:47] <Nasp> I've never seen that
[23:28:04] <JakeSays> MM in roman numerals is two thousand
[23:28:27] <JakeSays> i dont remember why MM is used for million, but it is
[23:29:03] <kuahara> If I'm looking to write a program or three to read in text data and write output to sheets within excel workbooks, will I have an easier time learning to do that with c# or with python?
[23:29:26] <JakeSays> c#
[23:30:15] <Nasp> Ask the same people to the python people
[23:30:19] <Nasp> And you'll get the opposite answer
[23:30:36] <kuahara> yea, I was thinking that before I asked the question, but figured I was more likely to get a python answer here than a c# answer there.
[23:31:37] <JakeSays> well, objectively there are excellent .net tools for manipulating office documents
[23:31:51] <JakeSays> also objectively python sucks
[23:36:28] <MatthiasVance> These ought to be enough, right? type PrimitiveType =     | PositiveInteger     | Integer     | Decimal     | String     | Guid     | Bool
[23:38:05] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: enough for what?
[23:39:11] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: and positiveinteger? wtf
[23:39:56] <JakeSays> that's going to be extremely limiting if you can't set it to zero
[23:40:32] <MatthiasVance> Well, zero is included :x
[23:40:42] <MatthiasVance> I should call it unsigned
[23:40:46] <MatthiasVance> at least internally
[23:40:49] <JakeSays> it's a poor choice for a name
[23:42:02] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: a more accurate and equally annoying name would be NonNegativeInteger
[23:42:59] <MatthiasVance> This was primarily for end users to "choose data types". I figured "number that supports negatives" and "number that supports only positives" would be plenty :P
[23:43:27] <JakeSays> if it's for end users then just have Integer
[23:44:04] <JakeSays> i guarantee you you'll get support calls asking why a positive integer can't equal 0
[23:44:12] <MatthiasVance> But it can
[23:44:16] <MatthiasVance> It's just uint
[23:44:26] <JakeSays> of course it can
[23:44:30] <MatthiasVance> ohhh
[23:44:32] <MatthiasVance> Yes I get y ou
[23:44:33] <JakeSays> but end users, remember?
[23:45:30] <JakeSays> if you need two and dont want to used unsigned, then i'd go with NonNegativeInteger
[23:55:47] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Yeah I also kind of wonder what will happen if you ask semi-technical end users .. what range do you want .. 4 million or 8 billion they would always pick 8 billion because better safe than sorry, right
[23:56:19] <JakeSays> of course
[23:56:46] <JakeSays> you're already going to have to explain the difference between integer and decimal
[23:56:54] <MatthiasVance> Paid option "upgrade to 8 billion range"
[23:57:20] <JakeSays> lol
