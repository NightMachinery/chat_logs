[23:21:08] <markand> hey there
[23:21:39] <markand> I don't know if this is a stupid question but I realized that after several months of brew update && brew upgrade netnewswire was never updated until I removed it installed it again
[23:21:43] <markand> did I miss something?
[23:22:22] <markand> it was staying at 5.1.3 while reinstalling fetched the 6.0.3 version
