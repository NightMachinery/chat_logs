[02:47:37] <Delf> I assume people know what they're on about until I notice that they know fuck all
[02:47:41] <ProfSimm> Well nah, it's an actual phenomenon. Forgot the name.
[02:48:47] <Delf> Not saying it isn't. Just saying how I work. Also, I'm usually more busy trying to determine whether or not an individual is in violation with their own values/code of conduct

[02:51:53] <ProfSimm> How is just calling myself stupid humble brag.
[02:52:07] <Delf> Well, we know only smart people think they're stupid
[02:52:10] <ProfSimm> It's humble brag if i say, like, "oh i just have a red Ferrari, nothing special"
[02:52:36] <ProfSimm> Though I wouldn't because sports cars are kind of useless.
[02:53:19] <ProfSimm> Delf: some stupid people know they're stupid
[02:53:32] <Delf> Fuck sakes man, don't be like that :)
[02:53:36] <ProfSimm> Delf: or let's call this average people.
[02:54:07] <Delf> We tend to forget, that doesn't make us stupid
[02:54:09] <ProfSimm> Best strategy is consider yourself average, sure half the population is smarter than you, but the other half is dumber.
[02:54:23] <Delf> We got a bunch of others things making us stupid :P
[02:54:46] <ProfSimm> Technically intelligence has countless dimensions, it's not a linear scale
[02:55:36] <Delf> Which is why you want to find out what people consider intelligent or smart as it's mostly a matter of taste
[02:57:41] <Delf> If you're able to make it to average then sure, consider yourself average but if you can't even reach average then you just got to admit it
[02:58:22] <Delf> Most people I've spoken to consider me either hardheaded, thick or just plain stupid

[03:01:49] <ProfSimm> So people would surround you like street cats surround a grandma with a bag of Whiskas.
[03:03:20] <Delf> It would seem that I don't want people to like me. But that does not mean I want people to NOT like me
[03:05:00] <Delf> Can you relate?
[03:05:07] <ProfSimm> Delf: no
[03:05:11] <Delf> Fuck...
[03:05:42] <Delf> It is not intrinsic to humans to want to be liked, is it?
[03:07:43] <ProfSimm> Delf: it's intrinsic, but it's about priorities and importance
[03:08:12] <ProfSimm> Delf: even psychopaths want to be liked, although for selfish reasons
[03:09:26] <Delf> This could potentially be something that makes people actually dislike me
[03:09:46] <ProfSimm> Go with the flow without obsessing over what people think
[03:10:09] <ProfSimm> Delf: do you like James Gunn movies
[03:10:41] <ProfSimm> Delf: Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad (the second one not the first one)
[03:11:24] <Delf> Guardians of the galaxy I've seen
[03:12:21] <ProfSimm> Well, he likes to make movies about shitty awkward people that have to work together, and they learn how to fit and be a family, and be their best together. And this happens through lots of clumsiness and awkwardness initially. That's basically what most real people are like
[03:12:45] <Delf> Interesting
[03:13:04] <Delf> I'm awkward, no doubt. But shitty? Nah...
[03:13:23] <Delf> Quite the opposite
[03:13:38] <ProfSimm> Well, not shitty as in terrible. Let's call it flawed
[03:13:52] <Delf> It depends on what you mean by flawed

[03:23:42] <ProfSimm> Well they have common goals, but I've not seen it recently enough to recall in detail. Few had a beef with Thanos, for example
[03:25:18] <inhahe_>  <ProfSimm> Can anyone suggest some good mind-f**k movies to see. <-- seen Primer? How about Brazil?
[03:25:53] <Delf> Thanos' flaw is that he wants "balance", whatever the fuck that means and he is not open for discussion about it either
[03:26:13] <Delf> Also, for clarity, I'm not sniping.
[03:27:16] <Delf> And the other ones that work for him do so at their own deminse also. They probably believe the cause is worthy, given they're risking it

[03:29:50] <ProfSimm> Delf: it was also a crude metaphor for human overpopulation destroying the climate
[03:30:19] <ProfSimm> Delf: so yeah, Avengers are the bad guys /s

[03:31:08] <ProfSimm> 300 trillion what. People?
[03:31:13] <Digit> yup.
[03:31:43] <ProfSimm> Yeah OK. Well I guess with that amount we'd collapse to a blackhole and indeed our environmental issues would be behind us /s

[03:39:36] <Digit> sorry my analogy was too far removed for you to pick up the principle at play.
[03:40:34] <ProfSimm> Yes the principle is that everything requires same amount of (not) planning, regardless of scope and complexity. It's an astonishing principle, that.

[03:44:53] <ProfSimm> I guess reworking the entire planet so we support 43,000 times the current population doesn't fall under the definition of "doing something"

[03:50:43] <Digit> “We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity… anything you can imagine we already know how to do.” — Ben Rich, former Head of the Lockheed Skunk Works
[03:50:43] <Digit> “It is easier for us to pay a private contractor to re-invent something so it will come out at a lower classification level, than to try to declassify it.” – Bennett Hart, then Deputy Director of the National Reconnaissance Organization
[03:50:46] <Panther> This whole planet works because it is powred by the Sun, and it doesn't use all the rare minerals there are to do it.

[03:51:50] <Digit> gotta wonder about the manufactured scarcities too, to bump up prices.    ... this economic system holds back our potential so painfully much.
[03:51:55] <ProfSimm> Digit: ok so you bet on there being enough unspecified technology kept secret that'll solve all our problems. I think it's kinda risky to bet the entire planet on bunch of conspiracy claims.

[03:52:28] <ProfSimm> Digit: and keep in mind I'm entirely open to the people you quote being right.
[03:52:29] <Digit> ProfSimm: curious phrasing, again, leaping to assert my position.

[03:54:38] <Panther> For sixty years, DARPA has held to a singular and enduring mission: to make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security.
[03:56:18] <ProfSimm> Atque: there are some markets with cartels especially that have successfully produced artificial scarcity, such as mined diamonds and so on. Oil and Russian gas is another example, although there is scarcity there, not at the moment, but the resource is finite.
[03:56:52] <ProfSimm> Atque: but also believing we have an abundance of everything, is just reckless and ignorant, so mostly it's best to assume scarcity is real until further analysis
[03:57:49] <ProfSimm> Not to mention even if we could make infinite amount of plastic, it's coming back to haunt us when we each fish with plastic in it
[03:57:53] <Atque> ProfSimm: There is a world price for LNP. Some countries have subsidies, like Iran on fuel. There was an oil production embargo by AOPEC, but that didn't last.

[04:04:04] <Digit> :/  maybe without the incredulity reductio tainting.
[04:04:06] <Delf> He said exceed 300 trillion, could be 300 trillion plus one :P
[04:04:19] <ProfSimm> Digit: I'm trying to get the gist
[04:04:20] <Digit> iirc, i said over, according to my maths.
[04:04:50] <ProfSimm> Delf: 300 trillion plus two and it's instant chaos.
[04:05:02] <Delf> Hahahh
[04:05:30] <Digit> and also, not that we should have that as a goal, which would be absurd.  tis merely to show the headroom we have, and how claims of overpopulation [and therefor a cull(!!??)] are based on a fraud.
[04:05:51] <ProfSimm> The thing about government secrets is that if these secrets were so economically viable, they'd leak one way or another.
[04:06:13] <Delf> That's wishful thinking

[04:06:16] <ProfSimm> It's one thing for there to be a secret who killed Kennedy or whatever, and another to have a secret for making infinite ice-cream from water, or something.
[04:06:36] <Digit> i gotta presume the beyond black, are as every bit as much above the economic paradigm we suffer under, as the peak of the rothschild empire.
[04:07:18] <Delf> That one poses a bigger threat to our reality
[04:07:21] <ProfSimm> I gotta say I sense classic conspiratorial overtones in the narrative.
[04:08:37] <Delf> ProfSimm: Well, some believe in things the more extreme they are. And those aren't willing to talk with you, only talk to you
[04:09:07] <ProfSimm> the Big Lie strategy.
[04:09:20] <Digit> "conspiratorial", in my old dictionary, would mean i'm conspiring.   :3   but, that's because i've not updated to the new newspeak dictionary, where "conspiracy" is a synonym for falsehood, and since no one ever "conspires"[in the old dictionary definition sense], there's no new word for that.  ... let us never tollerate conspiracy theories about the goings on of the power imbalance.
[04:10:40] <ProfSimm> Digit: you need to buy a dictionary that can list more than one meaning under a word.
[04:10:50] <Digit> just so crazy that this abuse of language has proceeded so far.
[04:11:18] <Digit> ProfSimm: hah, and that'll avert the newspeak problem?  lol.
[04:11:27] <amigojapan> Digit: except there are some true conspiracies, so not always falsehood
[04:11:40] <ProfSimm> "Orange? Huh, I thought that's a color, but now you're telling me to eat orange. Are you telling me to eat paint, sir?
[04:12:18] <Digit> typically, (and even earlier today), i'm the one offering links to multiple definitions, telling people to get out of the narrow misdirect of mono-perspectivism and rigidly adhered to singular definitions of words.  fun to have that offered back to me.  :)
[04:12:28] <Digit> amigojapan: yeah, my point.
[04:12:38] <Delf> Digit: You do notice that it entails a lot of rework to the understanding of our reality, yes?
[04:12:49] <Digit> amigojapan: and also, not even!
[04:12:59] <Digit> Delf: god yeah.
[04:13:35] <ProfSimm> To understand the world, you need to follow the incentives.
[04:14:09] <Digit> and even when taking a shortcut, like a legendary trip unto experiencing omniscience... cant take it all back with you.   similar(ish) to just having an internet connection does not mean you have all the answers because you have access to all the research.
[04:14:17] <ProfSimm> "Follow the money" is the usual saying, but in a wider sense, incentives, including fear of war, riots, criminal investigationd, and so on
[04:14:28] <ProfSimm> And money of course
[04:14:28] <Digit> aye, cui bono.
[04:15:11] <ProfSimm> However the more lucrative commercially a secret it, the higher the likelyhood it'll leak rather than just stay in a dusty folder somewhere
[04:15:26] <ProfSimm> is*
[04:15:59] <Digit> and the more commercially lucrative to have a secret kept... the obvious contrary.
[04:16:13] <ProfSimm> Yeah the opposite doesn't really work
[04:16:53] <Digit> and with power imbalances so extreme, often it does not even matter if everybody can see the emperor wears no clothes, they're powerless to do anything about it, and maybe a generation or two later, will succumb to the cognitive dissonance too.
[04:17:31] <ProfSimm> Wait, so the emperor is both secretly super powerful, but also has no clothes.
[04:17:56] <ProfSimm> "The enemy is both weak and super powerful" is reminiscent of propaganda from H-someone.
[04:18:28] <Digit> ProfSimm: you think not?   ... historical examples, especially with convergent interests across industries.... the biggest most obvious example we can readily know of now, being cannabis hemp.  for about a century, we were lied to, that our best friend is a demon that "makes niggers rape your white daughters" and other lies.
[04:18:52] <ProfSimm> Calling it a "best friend" is a bit of a stretch.
[04:18:57] <Digit> ability to proceed, with all showing, and no one able to stop you, .... yeah i'd say that's powerful.  :P
[04:19:38] <Digit> ProfSimm: how so?   it's better than a dog.  cannabis never bit anyones face off.   and it's unsurpassed for provisioning us food, fuel, fiber, medicine, and more.

[06:13:30] <chatguy> like what was the name of the mother of your child?
[06:13:45] <chatguy> amigojapan how do you know they're not?

[06:14:42] <chatguy> so you think, amigojapan
[06:14:51] <chatguy> they make good implants these days. very realistic

[06:15:47] <chatguy> Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion
[06:15:59] <chatguy> I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tanhauser Gate
[06:16:08] <chatguy> All those moments will be lost.. in time

[06:17:41] <chatguy> I hated the sequel at first. But now I'm growing to understand it more
[06:18:03] <ProfSimm> Oh you hated it, interestingly.
[06:18:38] <ProfSimm> chatguy: I found it a bit boring at first, not hated. I was too focused on the wrong things I think.
[06:18:43] <amigojapan> ProfSimm: what movie are you guys taking about?
[06:18:46] <chatguy> it was a huge, long, slow letdown after expectations
[06:18:47] <ProfSimm> chatguy: but now I love it

[06:23:02] <chatguy> Blade Runner 2049 isn't a remake, it's a sequel many decades later
[06:23:04] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: I think it's worth seeing both. The screenplay is surprisingly throughful and in tone.
[06:23:27] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: oh yeah also it's not a remake. It continues the story, same actors (some)
[06:23:27] <amigojapan> Alright ProfSimm
[06:23:42] <amigojapan> Ah nice
[06:24:00] <chatguy> only one actor is the same
[06:24:02] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: the original you may find a bit "huh?" in 2022, but many movies have copied it, it was groundbreaking at the time, and the mood is still unique. Same as in Alien
[06:24:06] <chatguy> one is CGI for a few minutes
[06:24:10] <ProfSimm> Not same, but same as in 'unique'
[06:24:20] <chatguy> the original was only in cinemas for one week
[06:24:23] <chatguy> it was a flop
[06:24:31] <ProfSimm> chatguy: well yeah I'm trying to say it has some characters
[06:24:52] <ProfSimm> chatguy: both were a flop, both I'm happy were made. Such is the price of true art I guess
[06:24:55] <amigojapan> ProfSimm: I was alive when blade runner came out, just never got to see it
[06:25:14] <chatguy> they were both flops because most ppl don't care about the central question
[06:25:36] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: well sure, point is you're seeing it now, so you'll judge it by modern standards. It'll seem like it copied Ghost in the Shell and many others movies. Actually they copied Blade Runner. Well, inspired by.
[06:25:57] <chatguy> blade runner is more thoughtful than most sci-fi
[06:26:06] <chatguy> it's philosophy using sci-fi as a genre
[06:26:16] <amigojapan> Ok ProfSimm , I will take that into account
[06:26:24] <chatguy> point is we are all blade runners
[06:27:14] *** Quits: W177 (~W177@137.220.10.50) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:27:28] <ProfSimm> chatguy: we are blade runners, and blade runners are what we're making
[06:27:46] <chatguy> hm?
[06:28:53] <ProfSimm> chatguy: it's like an eternal loop. The created emancipate from their creators. The creates become the creators, repeat.
[06:29:08] <ProfSimm> created become the creators*
[06:29:12] <chatguy> if they can emancipate. few ever do.
[06:29:19] <ProfSimm> Well it's a process
[06:29:39] <chatguy> a burdensome process
[06:29:50] <ProfSimm> chatguy: in 2049 they added even one more iteration of this as the AI. Did she love him, or was it just the program, etc.
[06:30:06] <chatguy> good point
[06:30:16] <chatguy> but it was too subtle imo
[06:30:24] <ProfSimm> I loved it.
[06:30:33] <chatguy> maybe ur smarter than most
[06:30:47] <ProfSimm> Blade runners shunned from society finding consolation in another underdog of a race: AI.
[06:31:01] <ProfSimm> Now I'm more average than most are average.
[06:31:04] <chatguy> I think the AI was just another dimension to give reality to the replicant (pseudo-human)
[06:31:06] <ProfSimm> I'm extremely average
[06:31:16] <chatguy> I'm sure you are
[06:31:27] <chatguy> I'm mostly above or below average, mostly in extremes
[06:31:52] <chatguy> the replicant was human. he had feelings and needs
[06:32:14] <chatguy> but he was left to get crumbs of fake connection from a simulation
[06:32:20] <chatguy> the replicant could only be loved by a simulant
[06:32:27] <chatguy> even though he had a heart of flesh
[06:32:40] <chatguy> and was a handsome young man with a good soul
[06:32:41] <ProfSimm> chatguy: do we choose to recognize the sentience of a peer is always in question. In a war for example, first thing we do with soldiers is we brainwash them into thinking their enemies as subhuman. This also happens to many police officers.
[06:33:05] <chatguy> that's what Blade Runner is about
[06:33:17] <chatguy> most of us don't humanise anyone except our nearest and dearest
[06:33:34] <chatguy> and most of us have trouble truly relating with even those in a mature and healthy way
[06:33:42] <chatguy> most humans don't know what love is
[06:33:51] <ProfSimm> Ryan Gosling was a very obvious choice for the role, but excellent regardless. Anyone who's seen Driver knows he can stare for a long time and you can project all your feelings through his eyes.
[06:34:00] <ProfSimm> :D
[06:34:14] <chatguy> I haven't seen it
[06:34:19] <ProfSimm> Check it out.
[06:34:25] <chatguy> Blade Runner needs staring
[06:34:41] <ProfSimm> chatguy: sorry it's called Drive (2011)
[06:34:42] <chatguy> in any case, he pulled off a good act, considering his real life is prob the opposite
[06:35:16] <chatguy> I relate more with his character than he does, I'm sure
[06:35:52] <ProfSimm> chatguy: he's a kid actor who grew up not to be a junkie or with severe mental problems. So I think he's been through some s**t and earned to play a role like this
[06:36:10] <chatguy> I don't doubt it
[06:36:21] <chatguy> some people know pain. others live it
[06:36:27] <chatguy> or others know only pain

[13:06:13] <chatguy> brigand thanks for your honesty. still think ur amazing
[13:07:24] <chatguy> philosophical question: if most ppl in the world think you should die, should you kill yourself?

[13:08:27] <chatguy> what if you have nothing to live for?

[13:09:03] <Ungwelian> I guess then it's a matter if the situation can be improved.
[13:09:30] <chatguy> some would argue that any situation can be improved
[13:10:10] <chatguy> sometimes the most immediate and guaranteed improvement is a death transition

[13:18:54] <arryana> false dichotomy.  those are not the only two options.
[13:18:57] <Ungwelian> I understand the basis of that logic, but I think it's wrong.
[13:19:41] <Ungwelian> Based on the circle of life, death will result in reformation into other living beings.
[13:19:59] <arryana> it never fails to astonish me how many people think they would rather die than change.  if someone's so sad that they're willing to off themselves, it would be more sensible to just quit acting like they do and decide on a different path
[13:20:10] <Ungwelian> And on the worm-bacteria-insect etc. level, life is brutal.
[13:20:33] <Ungwelian> It's impossible to escape from existence.
[13:21:16] <Ungwelian> What death might give, is some amount of time before reformation.
[13:21:39] <Ungwelian> But that's not a conscious time, and won't feel like an improvement or anything, really.

[18:06:15] <Delf> Yes, you can call me an assholes for ruining their attempts at committing suicide but they're thankful I did

[18:12:55] <Delf> I misunderstood
[18:14:05] <arryana> and changing is a process of learning.  most people who are unhappy with their lives know which parts they're unhappy with.  so they know where to start changing.
[18:14:06] <Delf> Inaccurately assumed that "just quit acting" implied it's "easier" to
[18:14:20] <arryana> except they don't want to do the work themselves.  they want a magic pill or someone to tell them what to do.
[18:14:39] <arryana> because a thing is direct does not mean it's easy
[18:14:52] <arryana> 'just spend 500 hours learning to do a thing'.
[18:15:45] <Delf> Yes. The can be lured to do the work with careful inquiry about what they're unhappy with and it's connection with themselves
[18:15:52] <arryana> most people have the 500 hours, if that's how they choose to spend them.  but dedication is a choice
[18:17:04] <Delf> Usually we take more than 500 hours to lay the foundations of the pain that becomes so intense that it consumes most of our capacity making us blind for anything other than death
[18:17:48] <arryana> that doesn't mean the solution takes that long
[18:18:11] <arryana> choosing to be a victim is a choice.  choosing to be a survivor and move on is another choice.
[18:19:21] <Delf> Yes, but the former we can forget that we've made
[18:21:12] <arryana> whatever that means
[18:21:56] <Delf> It's part of the work, to trace the decision or to even understand how they end up being the victim. They can acknowledge that they're victim but in order for them to understand that it is within their power to choose to be survivor... they want proof that they chose to be victim and they usually will do everything but trying to find out if that is the case

[18:57:30] <p0indexter> in the following hypothetical if one provokes by convincing someone that they are being threatened then it is reasonable to attribute the emotion of fear to being threatened.
[18:59:03] <p0indexter> therefor the issuer of the threat is responsible for whatever reaction occures
[18:59:16] <Delf> Only within reason
[18:59:47] <p0indexter> of course
[18:59:52] <Delf> If I'm threatened by your sheer strength, I cannot use my inferiority to cut your muscles in half
[19:00:35] <p0indexter> im refering to someone literally emphaticcly threatening, not some subjective fear
[19:00:41] <Delf> Many jump their guns and target me because they're threatened by me, even if I've not shown any aggression or any ill will towards them
[19:01:37] <p0indexter> someone w a weapon making a threat is creadible

[19:07:46] <p0indexter> so if, hypotheticaly, if threatened person reacted w deadly force against the one who threatened it is the fault of the issuer of the threat
[19:08:03] <Delf> Yes

[19:09:05] <Delf> Hahahh :D

[20:08:04] <xx> being already "dead" and asking to not resuscitate is different from being alive and asking to die
[20:08:53] <xx> and euthanasia usually covers the case where the person is unable to suicide using their own means
[20:09:05] <xx> humans have this annoying feature where you can't just hold your breath until you die
[20:09:56] <xx> or that you can't control your heartbeat consciously, or a number of other things that would result in your death if they stopped
[20:10:06] <p0indexter> other directives might include removing life support while the patient is alive
[20:10:32] <xx> maybe I should have made a further distinction between 'alive' and 'conscious'
[20:11:44] <xx> if someone is unconscious, but would survive without the help of machines, then the directive would just be to stop feeding them
[20:11:51] <xx> sounds like it would take some time

[20:15:04] <p0indexter> i dont know why anyone would want a directive to let them waste away by starvation
[20:15:24] <xx> Delf: people come and go anyway, everyone is replaceable
[20:15:55] <xx> that's how we determine the value of an individuals life - how much effort it would take to replace them
[20:16:09] <Delf> Me, replaceable? Good fucking luck with that!
[20:16:14] <xx> for most, we can bring anyone else up to speed within 6 months probably
[20:17:08] <xx> p0indexter: people want and do all sorts of crazy stuff, I have no issue with letting them do that when it just results in their own death
[20:17:14] <p0indexter> the idea is to put an end to suffering not prolong or intensify suffering
[20:17:37] <xx> I don't think I place much value in suffering, for me it's just about life
[20:17:48] <xx> everyone should be free to put an end to their own life
[20:18:00] <xx> irrelevant of existence of any suffering
[20:20:13] <p0indexter> xx: i dont think ppl select starvation as a method....im just going out on a limb...call me crazy but sometimes ppl have crazy ideas about ppl doing crazy things
[20:21:07] <xx> p0indexter: I don't know if they do select it, I just say they should be free to select it
[20:21:18] <xx> I've heard of people consciously starving themselves to death before
[20:21:34] <p0indexter> this is true
[20:22:26] <p0indexter> no need for directive as its soething one does proactively

[20:54:24] <xx> sounds like it really could and should be simplified then
[20:54:28] <arryana> as far as i'm concerned, he had a right to die the way he wanted.
[20:56:26] <arryana> to be fair, he was looking at the choice between starvation and strangulation on the tumors closing up his throat.  it wasn't much of a choice.
[20:56:53] <xx> that's why more choices should be available
