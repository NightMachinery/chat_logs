[05:27:11] <r3> however, the hardest I have ever laughed (after desperately trying not to) was when I was in line at McDonalds and there were two DD gentleman in front of me (maybe Down syndrome, not important).  It was time for them to order, and one of them says "May I have a number two please?"
[05:27:42] <r3> ...and his friend said "NO, you wanted a number three you retard" and thwacks him on the back of the head tilting his hat forward.  The first gentleman fixes his hat and responds: "Oh, oh yeah, a number three please"
[05:29:20] <r3> it was like a skit, or a Laurel and Hardy film, I just found it to be really funny and revealing a bit about these gentleman's lives...

[12:54:54] <pussipupu> Given ethanol is significantly toxic, very much so
[12:56:32] <darsie> This is about relative toxicity, not absolute toxicity.
[13:00:49] <pussipupu> Oh sorry, I read the first quote as “significantly toxic”
[13:00:58] <pussipupu> But still yes, I don't see any contradition there
[13:01:05] <darsie> ok
[13:06:15] <Tanuki> "significantly" and "moderately" may have specific meanings in medicine/toxicology here.
[13:07:36] <pussipupu> Sure, but certainly in general uses they aren't mutually exclusive terms
[13:09:43] <darsie> This i from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug) .
[13:12:00] <Tanuki> I see. So, where it says "significantly more toxic," there's a reference ([12]).
[13:12:19] <Tanuki> I guess that paper is where that's taken from, and where "significantly more toxic" is defined.
[13:12:32] <pussipupu> I'd expect a general encycolpædia to be in pretty normal language
[13:13:48] <pussipupu> Interestingly it's specifically “mild, brief exposure” that's described as moderately more toxic, so it's not even the same thing described as as “significantly” and “moderately” more toxic than other things
[13:14:17] <Tanuki> But the concept itself is specialized (one of toxicology), so, again, "significantly more toxic" perhaps has a numerical definition (for example, how many standard deviations away when performing a statistical analysis on LD50).
[13:14:23] *** Joins: nalkri (~user@user/nalkri)
[13:14:59] <darsie> pussipupu: I rea that as "isopropanol, being only moderately more toxic than ethanol,".
[13:16:15] <pussipupu> It might, but if they're using a technical meaning(without marking it as such) like that in what's a general non-specialist encyclopædia would be bad form IMNSHO
[13:16:41] <pussipupu> darsie: Fair point, though I'd say the sentence in question is pretty ambiguously phrased
[13:17:14] <Tanuki> What I'm saying is that there's no "general, non-specialist" meaning possible in this context. For example, it even says methanol is "profoundly more toxic" than ethanol later in the same paragraph, having said "significantly more toxic" previously.

[13:18:54] <pussipupu> Well, I disagree, though it's not going to be a tightly defined one
[13:19:14] <Tanuki> Yeah, sure, I guess there's variability.
[13:19:57] <pussipupu> And I think that these words /should/ be tagged in the article, with what definitions they're using
[13:20:13] <Tanuki> Yes, definitely.
[13:20:16] <pussipupu> In an ideal world that is
[13:20:33] <bullgard4> What is "_creamy_ milk"? I bought in a shop a "caffeè latte" paper cup labeled "Arabian beans from Guatemala and Honduras & creamy milk". en.wikipedia.org does not list an article titled "creamy milk". Is it simply skimmed milk enriched with milk cream?
[13:20:33] <Tanuki> When it comes to things like toxicology, you really shouldn't be vague.
[13:20:53] <pussipupu> But if I think too much about that I'll start ranting about razing the wiki* projects and starting again with real data types :þ
[13:21:12] <pussipupu> Any milk with a high cream content I'd say
[13:21:33] <pussipupu> Which includes unskimmed milks as well as skimmed milks with cream added
[13:21:50] <bullgard4> pussipupu, Thank you.
[13:22:03] <pussipupu> Hmm, actually as it's a laté it might be just refering to texture

[13:30:18] <darsie> Can a semicolon substitute a full stop ;)
[13:32:04] <raccoon_dog> According to some style guides, like this one, you can: https://www.niu.edu/writingtutorial/punctuation/semicolon.shtml
[13:32:31] <raccoon_dog> (It calls it a "period" here because this is an American style guide; "full stop" is a British term.)
[13:32:53] <drbean> There's a disconnect between the ordinary meaning of 'significant' and for example, 'statistically significant'.
[13:33:35] <raccoon_dog> Right. And the precise numbers attached to "statistically significant" change from field to field, from study to study, etc.
[13:36:45] <drbean> A lot of the technical articles in wikipedia are over my head.
[13:37:32] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, and I do think that's a problem -- some Wikipedia articles do have that thing on top that says that it needs to be rewritten to make it more accessible to a more general audience.
[13:38:27] <darsie> raccoon_dog: Ok, but that doesn't apply at the end of a message ;)
[13:38:42] <pussipupu> Using technical language wouldn't be a problem with inline glossary though

[13:48:37] <r3> I've found some of the simple entries for technical topics are quite well done and well written
[13:49:35] <darsie> Is the order of "pestle and mortar" important?

[13:53:02] <darsie> I think likely someone will not be in US and Europe.
[13:53:33] <gneeriiloeepdeer> what car do you have and how expensive are it's wheels?
[13:53:38] <gneeriiloeepdeer> is this a correct sentence?
[13:53:45] <darsie> no
[13:53:47] <darsie> 'its'.
[13:53:55] <gneeriiloeepdeer> thank you
[13:54:18] <darsie> What you wrote means "how expensive are it is wheels".
[13:54:36] <gneeriiloeepdeer> I need to move to an English speaking country
[13:54:40] <r3> how about "the" instead of "its"
[13:55:10] <gneeriiloeepdeer> well Imean exclusively the weels of the model, so the is not precise enough
[13:55:39] <pussipupu> “What model of car do you have and how expensive are wheels for it?”
[13:55:55] <r3> 'are the wheels'
[13:56:30] <r3> and by wheels do you mean the tires?  Or the rims?
[13:57:04] <darsie> I had that thought, too, but wheels mean both, I think.
[13:57:59] <r3> mmmm, someone jumped on me when I said wheels, he said that meant only the rims.  I told him that the wheels on the bus go 'round and 'round...
[13:58:11] <gneeriiloeepdeer> tires
[13:58:15] <gneeriiloeepdeer> .w rim
[13:58:17] <tinsoldier> rim — Noun: 1. An edge around something, especially when circular., 2. (automotive, cycling) A wheelrim., 3. (journalism) A semicircular copydesk., — Verb: 1. To form a rim on., 2. (transitive) To follow the contours, possibly creating a circuit., 3. (transitive or intransitive, of a ball) To roll around a rim. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rim
[13:58:23] <gneeriiloeepdeer> no rims
[13:58:35] <gneeriiloeepdeer> neither driving wheel
[13:58:37] <gneeriiloeepdeer> :D
[13:58:50] <pussipupu> We have winter and summer wheels, which presumably have different replacement costs
[13:59:18] <gneeriiloeepdeer> now I wonder in what part of the anglosphere people change tires between seasons...
[13:59:21] <gneeriiloeepdeer> canada?
[13:59:47] <pussipupu> I'm not in the Anglosphere, I'm an immigrant elsewhere
[13:59:55] <r3> winter and summer tires, surely.
[14:01:12] <darsie> What car do you have and how expensive is its battery?
[14:01:26] <pussipupu> Well, they're more than just the tyre
[14:02:23] <r3> "... the rim is where the tire resides on the wheel and the rim supports the tire shape ... "
[14:02:55] <r3> it has to have rims
[14:03:07] <darsie> Are you tired when a car drives over you?
[14:03:07] <r3> meaning wheelrims
[14:03:50] <r3> also wheel? rim?  naw:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rim_(wheel)#Meaning
[14:04:03] <gneeriiloeepdeer> wheels are made of steel
[14:04:10] <darsie> On trains
[14:04:22] <gneeriiloeepdeer> wheel rims are made of steel
[14:04:39] <darsie> Train wheel tires are made of steel.
[14:04:41] <r3> they can be, or an alloy or aluminum...
[14:04:48] <r3> (for cars)
[14:05:04] <pussipupu> A quick search suggests that what I'm calling wheels are called wheels
[14:05:06] <pussipupu> So that's nice :þ
[14:05:17] <r3> what was the question again?
[14:05:22] <pussipupu> The wheels are different sizes anyway, so we wouldn't be able to just change the tyres
[14:05:43] <pussipupu> “winter and summer tyres, surely”
[14:05:51] <r3> pussipupu: see wiki article I linked, above
[14:06:16] <darsie> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_wheel#Railway_Wheel_and_Tire
[14:06:45] <r3> why are the wheels different sizes?  That's unusul.  On most cars the wheelrims are the same size and the tires/rims can be rotated.  
[14:06:46] <pussipupu> I'm not sure what point you're making with that link but OK
[14:06:55] <r3> Unless it's like a dragster
[14:07:06] <pussipupu> The winter wheels are a different size from the summer ones
[14:07:20] <r3> wat
[14:08:09] <r3> nobody I know has different size rims/wheels for the seasons.  Nobody.  One changes the seasonal tire from summer to winter.
[14:08:23] <r3> using the same rims
[14:08:40] <pussipupu> OK, that's not how it's done here
[14:08:49] <r3> and where is here?
[14:08:54] <pussipupu> At least not in the few cases I have direct experience of
[14:08:56] <pussipupu> Finland
[14:09:04] <r3> hmm
[14:09:32] <pussipupu> Taking the tyres off and on looks like a ballache anyway, much easier to leave them on and swap the wheels as a unit :þ
[14:10:04] <r3> yes, but that is more expensive and the tyres really shouldn't be left inflated on the rim for the off season
[14:10:29] <pussipupu> Duly noted.

[14:11:27] <r3> wiser to throw the four tires in the trunk, go down to the auto shop, have them inspect the tires and rims, re-balance the wheel, and then put them on the car and off you go.
[14:11:46] <r3> but hey
[14:11:55] <r3> different strokes for different folks.

[20:17:34] <IRCMonkey> I use a very simplistic typography\ syntax, as per the Microsoft Manual of Style (I guess it's more informal online parlance.)

[21:17:45] <kurahaupo> toretto: 100% cheaper means "free"

[21:18:22] <kurahaupo> toretto: But I assumed you meant "100% of a full-time workload"
[21:18:24] <toretto> No, 100% is not for the money, it's for the owrk.
[21:18:30] <toretto> Yeah.

[21:18:47] <kurahaupo> But it's not immediately obvious
[21:18:49] <toretto> s/owrk/work/
[21:18:50] <tinsoldier> t​oretto meant: No, 100% is not for the money, it's for the work.
[21:19:06] <kurahaupo> If you give a percentage, always99,99 says what it relates to
[21:19:42] <toretto> I see. What's your recommend way? Could you write the sentence?
[21:19:56] <kurahaupo> Having "for" twice is odd
[21:21:15] <kurahaupo> "I hired another 100% ETF employee for $200/hour"
[21:21:36] <toretto> What's ETF mean?
[21:21:46] <toretto> or What does ETF mean?
[21:21:52] <kurahaupo> Effective Full Time
[21:21:59] <toretto> I see.
[21:22:25] <kurahaupo> which should be known if you're dealing with human resources
[21:23:35] <kurahaupo> Or "I've hired more people to do 120 hrs/week, costing $5400/week
[21:24:34] <toretto> Does this sound good? "I've hired other person to do 100% for $200"
[21:24:58] <toretto> Like there isn't no two 'for' in here.
[21:25:02] <kurahaupo> No, you should say 100% of what. Hours?
[21:26:38] <toretto> No, it's actually for the completion of the work. Like people charge different $ for % of work to be done. The other guy told me that, he'd charge me $300 to just do 50% of the work. But he's asking if I still need him. I wanna reply that, I've already hired other guy for $200 to do the 100%(the whole) work..
[21:26:44] <kurahaupo> Probably a good idea to mention which tasks or roles you've hired them for
[21:27:04] <kurahaupo> "the whole job" 
[21:27:32] <kurahaupo> "I've hired someone else who'll do the whole job for $200"
[21:27:40] <toretto> Hmm...I actually gotta use %
[21:27:53] <toretto> It's not exactly the job. But a technical work. 
[21:28:10] <toretto> Like not in physical work. Think of homework or something. 
[21:28:17] <toretto> It's something like that.
[21:28:24] <kurahaupo> "I've hired someone else who'll complete 100% of (tasks) for $200"
[21:28:44] <toretto> Yeah, that sounds better.
[21:28:50] <toretto> I'll use that.
[21:29:20] <kurahaupo> fill in "tasks" with whatever is appropriate
