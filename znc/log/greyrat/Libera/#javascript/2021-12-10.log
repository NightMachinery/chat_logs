[00:20:10] <Maxdamantus> It should break clients, because 204 should mean something different.
[00:20:17] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: 204 means "200 without any body"
[00:20:27] <Maxdamantus> ljharb: no it doesn't.

[00:21:56] <Maxdamantus> Pretty sure HTTP doesn't mandate anything about status codes at tede protocol level.
[00:22:03] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: Maxdamantus the spec says, verbatim, "The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields."
[00:22:12] <Maxdamantus> at the protocol level, the status code is an opaque integer.
[00:22:14] <ljharb> hm
[00:22:20] <ljharb> or wait maybe i quoted from the wrong thing, one sec
[00:22:53] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: mdn says "Although this status code is intended to describe a response with no body, servers may erroneously include data following the headers." https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204 as another data point

[00:23:55] <ljharb> 204 is not allowed to have a body, full stop
[00:24:04] <Maxdamantus> Hm, okay, so the RFCs include some semantic interpretation.
[00:24:11] <ljharb> they definitely do
[00:24:17] <ljharb> http status codes are entirely about semantics

[00:25:59] <Maxdamantus> I think there should be a distinction between those abstractions, so fetch correctly avoids doinf those interpretations, and will provide access to a body on a 204 response.

[00:27:01] <ljharb> fetch may choose to do that, but such a body is still a server bug

[00:29:37] <Maxdamantus> like how DOM exists at a different level to canvas, even though hhey're ultimately specified together.
[00:29:49] <ljharb> what makes you think it was designed that way
[00:30:00] <ljharb> http standards were designed so the semantics are inseparable from the schema

[04:44:20] <madprops> thanks I think that worked

[05:11:39] <systemfault> I'm personally sure that "EVENTUALLY", ESM is going to replace CommonJS in NodeJS... but now, it's just too early. People need to publish packages supporting both for a while...

[05:13:02] <systemfault> It's just that in 10 years, CommonJS modules will probably (MY OPINION) be seen as "legacy"

[05:13:14] <stagas> this for a while has been going on for years. node should have just bumped a major version and dropped cjs completely, there'd be some pain for some time but then tooling would have to be developed and things would be solved now. this way the pain is constant everywhere, randomly packages don't work with each other and it's been like that for years
[05:13:40] <systemfault> stagas: Just dropping that would create a Python 2 -> 3 mess

[05:17:52] <sheetjs> in theory, a server could do some dynamic code splitting

[14:27:56] <crazyhorse> errr .... i dunno.. this is about the 7th time i've revisited the same problem
[14:28:05] <crazyhorse> and everytime i've gone back to ../..
[14:28:50] <crazyhorse> basically because it's always ended up being hacky in that you might have a package that works in node.. but then that same package won't work in webpack
[14:28:56] <crazyhorse> or vice-vers
[14:29:00] <crazyhorse> vice-versa
[14:29:36] <crazyhorse> really i just want a universal require('^whatever.js') or require('@/whatever.js')
[14:31:18] <stenno> so how about options 0 of the gist then
[14:34:04] <crazyhorse> yeah trying that now
[14:36:28] <crazyhorse> stenno: wow.. just works
[14:36:38] <stenno> nice
[14:36:55] <crazyhorse> const a = require('@/test.js')    and test is in root but this file is /a/b/c/d

[15:40:41] <stenno> with chrome, you can set a permanent :focus  state on the element, dunno if this also triggers the 'focus' event though
[15:41:21] <gohlzehn> mh let me test chrome
[15:42:52] <stenno> if you inspect element with chrome, on the 'style' tab there is a `:hov` select which lets you set the state

[22:08:28] <PenguinMan98> ... Is that maybe a react thing then?
[22:08:30] <ljharb> it’s great, it’s what it’s designed for
[22:08:38] <EdFletcher> ah interesting, good to know, thanks ljharb! concat it is
[22:08:39] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: nope. jQuery tho.
[22:08:59] <systemfault> ljharb: concat is a shorthand for concatenation, as in merging two arrays together.
[22:09:02] <ljharb> my favorite is `[].concat(x || [], y || [])`
[22:09:12] <PenguinMan98> Weird. I distinctly remember Code Review requiring me to learn and use it in the big react app I was working on a year back
[22:09:16] <AMPed> and it's non-destructive, yes?
[22:09:20] <EdFletcher> yeah and if anything concat could presumably be optimized in the runtime where the spread operator usage couldn't
[22:09:21] <ljharb> systemfault: which is what it does. It just also has an implicit .flat(1)
[22:09:25] <ljharb> AMPed: correct
[22:09:40] <ljharb> EdFletcher: i suspect both can be equally optimized for actual arrays

[22:11:03] <PenguinMan98> They said '.map() is for when you need to return something with each iteration and .each() is for when you just need to do something for each element'
[22:11:30] <han-solo> .forEach
[22:11:31] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: who is they
[22:11:40] <ljharb> forEach is for that, yes.
[22:12:03] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: but the issue here is they have both an array and an item. So, concat makes one array, and then forEach
[22:12:05] <PenguinMan98> *facepalm* Right. .forEach()
