[00:49:41] <W> anything testing only code within one process, that weren't unit tests, were named for the reason for writing the test (we generally focused on unit and integration test) - e.g. regression test if you have a bug you're not sure you've resolved

If I set my watch and check on where you are every 10 seconds, there's a good chance that one time I'm checking on you you'll be in your kitchen or something, and the next time your position will be out in the yard, having never intersected the wall.

[06:37:59] <PlanckWalk> I did assume linear interpolation, which is an approximation but a lot better than one that allows objects to pass through each other at high speeds.
[06:38:10] <W> InPhase, does it cause players to die from alien underwater wildlife barrelling into them at light speed in one frame?

[06:38:35] <PlanckWalk> But I suppose I have also had fun exploiting totally wacky physics in some games.
[06:39:05] <PlanckWalk> So I guess there is that aspect too, allowing such discovery.
[06:39:29] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: The next problem is that finding point of closest approach can be so computationally expensive that it's often cheaper to just update more often unless your object speeds have a very wide distribution.
[06:40:38] <leonardus> Why is GCC not being executed when the prerequisite is `src/%.c`, but it is being executed when I move the source files to the main directory and change it to just `: %.c`? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/7w0QclCA/Makefile
[06:40:43] <PlanckWalk> Err what?  In almost all cases it isn't any more computationally expensive than collision detection by overlapping.
[06:40:55] <W> it makes a whole lot more sense in game design to fudge what the player sees than the details of physics. Got 50 stacked cans of tomato soup falling over? Simulate it as one object, perhaps use a random of 4-5 different animations

[06:45:20] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: Unless you have to process all the consequences.  A tennis ball can't hit 3 racquets in a row.  If you process all three then you have to figure out which ones do and don't happen.  It's a lot more than just geometry when you have interwoven interactions.
[06:45:35] <leonardus> bcount`d: It works with the replacement, just not when src/ is in front of it
[06:45:50] <bcount`d> try using full path
[06:45:51] <leonardus> also I found out that it works when I do `make main.o`, but it places main.o in the src/ directory
[06:46:22] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: But maybe two of the racquets in the front hit each other first, so you can't process those two racquets if after you process the three tennis racquets and the ball you figure out the first two racquets never made it there.
[06:47:05] <bcount`d> or maybe $(PWD)/src
[06:47:08] <W> players are generally a lot more forgiving with strange bounce angles than strange bounce *velocities* too - after all, objects sometimes bounce in rare or unintuitive ways in real life too. They never bounce from your dropped hand back up to the ceiling and picking up speed from there
[06:47:19] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: So you'd have to process all the combinations to check, then sort them, then go through and figure out which ones matter by some logic...
[06:47:51] <InPhase> PlanckWalk: Or just double or quadruple the update and let the cache have a field day.
[06:47:58] <W> InPhase, once you have multiple collisions in one frame, the *player* isn't going to keep track or notice if you do it accurately

[08:57:09] <CoderGuy> I rewrote my question it might be more readable
[08:57:19] <CoderGuy> I have a question about architecture.  Lets say I have a textbox, and the textbox has to paint itself, does the textbox call textbox.paint(); and inside there it communicates to a view object OR is there somewhere else in the code that we call view.render(textbox);
[08:57:44] <rindolf> CoderGuy: i'm handling the morning's emails
[08:57:49] <CoderGuy> lol ok
[08:58:00] <nitrix> CoderGuy, I would expect some external engine to know what view it needs to display at any given time and provide the data that the view so it can paint the widgets it's responsible for.
[08:58:26] <CoderGuy> okay so nitrix, lets say your program is a text editor, how are you giving the textbox data to the view?
[08:58:32] <nitrix> The data flows down the chain of responsibilities.
[08:58:35] <rindolf> CoderGuy: i prefer 'view.render(textbox);'

[09:00:27] <CoderGuy> bcount`d so do you call draw upon a state changing?
[09:01:00] <CoderGuy> so you have just one big method draw(){ //get all the objects and then view.render(objectA); etc instead of ObjectA.paint();
[09:01:18] <nitrix> You might want to look into immediate mode UIs too.
[09:02:08] <bcount`d> it checks a rectangle that needs to be redrawn and then does it's thing
[09:02:21] <bcount`d> on the render target
[09:02:32] <CoderGuy> sure but the question is how, is it view.render(target) or target.render();
[09:02:44] <nisstyre> nitrix: just tried out raygui, it's p nice
[09:03:02] <bcount`d> target is just a bitmap basically?

[09:05:11] <bcount`d> rectangle parameters
[09:05:48] <CoderGuy> sure but in the parameters it has to do something to get the data, is it the textbox's method communicating with the view, or is it an existing view that says "give me the data" upon which you ask the textbox for the info
[09:06:41] <nitrix> CoderGuy, The view presumably knows how to draw itself in your design, but you're debating whether the view has to maintain data (which becomes complicated because then how and when does the data get updated?), or if it should be passed to it upon rendering. I prefer the latter.
[09:06:57] <CoderGuy> actually it's more simple then this nitrix

[09:07:32] <CoderGuy> it's, does the textbox contain a paint method where the view resides, or is the view seperate completely from the textbox where somewhere else in your program you call draw, and then inside draw it says view.draw(textbox.datatobedrawn);
[09:08:26] <nitrix> CoderGuy, The application passes the data to the view and asks the view to draw itself, the view passes a subset of the data to the textbox and asks the textbox to draw itself.
[09:08:59] <CoderGuy> aha okay so the problem was the textbox literally is the program here which means it's a part of the view
[09:09:19] <CoderGuy> and inside that area of the application, the literal view the textbox calls draw on itself
[09:09:27] <nitrix> If you think of it as a graph, you're trying to put logic and data in the leaves, which makes no sense to me.
[09:09:39] <CoderGuy> but you just said that
[09:09:45] <CoderGuy> the view passes a subset of the data to the textbox
[09:09:49] <CoderGuy> i'm saying this program is ltierally that
[09:10:02] <CoderGuy> that specific textbox in this case is the program

[09:10:20] <nitrix> Yeah, it flows downwards to the leaves, but they don't store anything. This stuff is very procedural/functional.
[09:10:28] <nitrix> You don't need stateful objects at all.
[09:10:46] <CoderGuy> yeah yeah sure okay so this textbox which is being used to display things, that one has a paint method

[09:11:16] <CoderGuy> and this doesn't change the fundamental of how we seperate views from data, because in this case this is the textbox painting
[09:11:29] <CoderGuy> so now my question is this textbox that paints
[09:11:33] <CoderGuy> it has to know how to paint
[09:11:37] <nitrix> At least not in the case of an OpenGL UI, but maybe if you're doing something like Win32 native UI, then you might have to keep some WinAPI handles to update the widgets that aren't under your control, but still.
[09:11:48] <CoderGuy> is it a problem if we can change the paint object on this textbox?
[09:12:40] <CoderGuy> so maybe this specific textbox has a Graphics object, and maybe the graphics object is different for each device is it okay to change it to match the new device?
[09:12:49] <nitrix> It doesn't make sense to have a "paint object". Painting is an action, those are normally methods on objects, not objects themselves.

[09:22:08] <CoderGuy> so there is Data that belongs to the textbox that is then painted by the textbox IE the data of the textbox
[09:22:34] <PlanckWalk> A lot of architectures do have a paint-like function or method for each component
[09:22:54] <PlanckWalk> Which uses lower-level functions together with the component's data to do rendering.
[09:23:09] <CoderGuy> and is this correct though? to have textbox{string text; paint(){//view.paint(text);}
[09:23:47] <CoderGuy> or is it better to have view(){ view.paint(textbox.text);}
[09:23:50] <PlanckWalk> What's view?
[09:24:08] <CoderGuy> I mean we can use Graphics if that's better
[09:24:21] <PlanckWalk> Also usually a textbox is redered as more than just text.

[09:24:53] <CoderGuy> oh of course
[09:25:07] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes, some of those are provided to it
[09:25:08] <CoderGuy> yeah so even more so having a paint method inside the textbox seems more proper

[09:33:42] <CoderGuy> so I think bcount`d it depends on how big your program is
[09:33:50] <CoderGuy> i'm saying this program is literally just a textbox
[09:34:01] <PlanckWalk> Well, I mean, the TextBox almost always stores the text that is/will be displayed at any given time
[09:34:01] <CoderGuy> and at that point i've limited it to the gui section of an application
[09:34:14] <nitrix> Visually it stores it, programmatically, whether that's permanently stored in the TextInput components or in a model that's supplied to the TextInput when it needs to be drawn is up to you.
[09:34:21] <CoderGuy> so if your application is literally just the view/gui then sure there isn't much seperation here
[09:34:22] <PlanckWalk> But that often should not be the "source of truth" for the rest of the program

[09:34:57] <bcount`d> i see, so maybe a handle to a textid
[09:35:01] <PlanckWalk> Often you want a model, and maybe the textbox read its local copy of the data from it, and sends its copy of the data when the user changes it.
[09:35:30] <nitrix> Yeah, it's not that uncommon for the application manipulating models and then the model is handed off to the UI "read-only", which will either use it as-is or have its own internal cache for performance reasons.
[09:36:00] <nitrix> Very common for web (Vue/React) with their "virtual dom" for example.
[09:36:04] <bcount`d> or duplicate memory usage
[09:36:09] <PlanckWalk> The text box might not even live on the same computer as the true data it's supposed to correspond with
[09:36:17] <nitrix> Video games are just going to redraw the ui every frame.
[09:36:18] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[09:36:44] <CoderGuy> yeah so I think it depends on what layer we're working with
[09:36:49] <PlanckWalk> E.g. think of editing a cell in a table which is populated by data from a remote server.
[09:36:55] <CoderGuy> when it's truly just the GUI layer, then sure the textbox renders itself
[09:37:15] <PlanckWalk> There may be multiple local copies
[09:37:24] <CoderGuy> so this textbox can have a paint method on it
[09:38:17] <CoderGuy> now lets go further lets say you have a chat
[09:38:18] <nitrix> CoderGuy, Conceptually the textinput renders itself, the data flows down the call chain and each widget is made up of other widgets, recursively until you're done.

[09:41:06] <CoderGuy> the GUI of the client irc chat is like the GUI layer it just shows the data, and said data changes when it gets told to be changed by the actual program
[09:41:09] <nitrix> Then why are you talking about networking all of sudden when we're discussing UIs. Those shouldn't be coupled up.
[09:41:18] <PlanckWalk> CoderGuy: Depending upon how you structure it, your text box input may directly tell the UI to add your new line to the scroll, or it may fire off a "text entered" message to a network handling listener, or ... etc
[09:41:49] <PlanckWalk> But your TextBox should not directly do, or know, anything about that wider structure.
[09:41:50] <CoderGuy> sure and I would argue that area the one outside the textbox, the one that even attaches a handler to the textbox, that's the model area of the program
[09:42:12] <CoderGuy> but the textbox itself, that has the ability to paint itself and store textdata
[09:42:25] <CoderGuy> and that's not ruining this concept of seperation between view and model
[09:42:42] <nitrix> Maybe at this point you should start asking more concrete questions if you want me to help.
[09:43:19] <CoderGuy> nitrix the paradox or problem was that a textbox contains data the text itself, and so if said textbox also paints itself, that ruins the entire concept of view seperation from model
[09:43:48] *** Quits: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:43:49] <CoderGuy> but as we discussed this further what i've realized is that, well the textbox literally is a part of the view, so it's okay if it has data
[09:43:54] <nitrix> No it doesn't. There's two principal school of thought with UIs, either the UI is stateful or the UI is immediate.
[09:43:58] <PlanckWalk> If it contains text data itself, then that text is not part of the model (in any model/view architexture)
[09:44:30] <CoderGuy> PlanckWalk, sure and that's okay, that text is simply local to the textbox but not to the program
[09:44:38] *** Joins: rapirent__ (~tony@123-195-196-153.dynamic.kbronet.com.tw)
[09:45:09] <nitrix> With a stateful UI, the widgets remember their state and you either don't redraw them unnecessarily, or if you do, they would redraw the very same way they did previously.

[09:45:22] *** Joins: justinf210 (~justinf21@192-230-160-245.3rivers.net)
[09:45:34] <nitrix> With an immediate mode UI, the widgets needs to be provided data every time they must be rendered. They cannot store information.
[09:45:43] <PlanckWalk> In some designs it might not have any text data locally, but obtain it from a supplied model as required.  (Not so great if you want an editable textbox)
[09:45:54] <CoderGuy> nitrix, so which of these is more organized?
[09:46:23] <CoderGuy> PlanckWalk, I just want the one that makes the most sense
[09:46:33] <PlanckWalk> They both make sense, they have different purposes.
[09:46:51] <CoderGuy> to me it seems like having Paint inside the textbox is more logical but remembering that a textbox is a part of the GUI layer, is key to grasping the concept of seperating the view from the model
[09:47:13] <nitrix> It's not really about organized. If you're using a library that provides the widgets, like native Win32 GDAPI stuff, then you're forced to go with the stateful UI. You create the element and you keep the handle in can you want to modify it.
[09:47:40] *** Joins: Retropikzel (~Retropikz@2001:999:202:1696:511:4378:6f76:bdee)
[09:47:50] <CoderGuy> but even in using this library nitrix the stateful UI is simply the GUI layer
[09:47:50] <nitrix> But if you also implement your own renderer like in a video game or the HTML/CSS templates of a website, then you have a bit more freedom and can do immediate mode stuff.
[09:48:20] <PlanckWalk> Having local copy of text is more useful in cases where you only want to update the model in specific circumstances (e.g. pressing enter)
[09:48:54] <CoderGuy> right right
[09:49:06] <nitrix> I still think you're going to need to improve the quality of your questions, we're going in circles.
[09:49:12] <CoderGuy> okay I think the answer is there is GUI layer and then there is your program which has both a GUI layer and a Model
[09:49:34] <CoderGuy> a textbox inside the GUI layer contains data and a paint method
[09:49:37] <nitrix> You just described a Model and a View.
[09:49:43] <nitrix> That's literally what they are -.-

[09:50:02] *** Joins: yamchah2 (~yamchah2@user/yamchah2)
[09:50:33] <PlanckWalk> It only has Model stuff if you're using it as the source of truth about your program's data
[09:50:34] <nitrix> The views are allowed to receive and use the models.
[09:50:47] <CoderGuy> nitrix, I see, that's what confused me
[09:50:51] <PlanckWalk> Which isn't great design usually, but is fine sometimes.
[09:50:51] <CoderGuy> I thought the idea was to seperate completely
[09:51:11] <PlanckWalk> You can't separate completely.  A View has to view *something*
[09:51:30] <CoderGuy> PlanckWalk, okay so considering a text editor very simple not intelligent you can only type into it and possibley you have the ability to undo, how are we seperating the data from the view?
[09:52:14] <PlanckWalk> There are quite a few options there
[09:52:41] <CoderGuy> i'm gonna guess you have currenttext; and then you have view(currenttext){ Textbox.setText(currenttext);}
[09:52:50] <CoderGuy> or something like this
[09:52:54] <PlanckWalk> Also quite a lot of complexities, especially with "undo"
[09:53:01] <CoderGuy> okay forget about undo
[09:53:02] <nitrix> In a proper Model-View-Controller application (MVC), the controllers instantiate views and models, will take decisions based on the models, perhaps transforms them, create new ones and eventually ask a view to render a model.

[09:53:20] <blahboybaz> sorry, bad timing
[09:53:23] <PlanckWalk> An undo function usually means storing some list of tree of model-altering actions.
[09:53:28] <PlanckWalk> list or* tree
[09:54:00] <Arahael> a list of actions and co-actions :)
[09:54:29] <CoderGuy> PlanckWalk, I just wanted a simple example of how the UI textbox part is not the model of the program
[09:55:13] <CoderGuy> I figured with undo it would clearly show this but
[09:55:32] <CoderGuy> it seems like if your textbox is your program how could you possibly have a model other then maybe in the model you have the text of your textbox?
[09:55:46] <PlanckWalk> I don't know what you mean by "
[09:55:52] *** Quits: pandakekok9 (~job@user/job) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:55:57] <PlanckWalk> I don't know what you mean by "if your textbox is your program"
[09:56:01] <nitrix> CoderGuy, The editor would keep a history of the actions done and a mapping somewhere of co-actions of how to undo these actions. Then if one of the action was to insert a line, then the co-action is to remove the line, both are going to result in the text getting updated, so the editor has to update its text, then tell the view to repaint itself (because the view probably doesn't draw the entire text, only a small region a scrollbar or whatever).
[09:56:19] <CoderGuy> so you run textbox.exe and literally just pops up a textbox to type into
[09:56:40] <PlanckWalk> You seem to be confusing "textbox.exe" with a TextBox GUI component.
[09:56:54] <nitrix> CoderGuy, Your problem is you keep trying to put functionalities into the widgets themselves.
[09:56:56] <CoderGuy> well yeah so the textbox can be one created by a framework but
[09:57:04] <PlanckWalk> No UI library provides a textbox component that is an independently runnable program.

[09:57:56] *** Joins: pandakekok9 (~job@user/job)
[09:57:59] <PlanckWalk> But more commonly the model is external to a GUI framework, and it just provides hooks for you to attach one.
[09:58:17] <nitrix> Yeah, GUI libraries almost never do model stuff.
[09:58:50] <nitrix> "Frameworks" maybe.
[09:58:56] <CoderGuy> nitrix okay so in this example all the program does is show a textbox inside a window using idk winforms or whatever

[10:00:56] <CoderGuy> okay so what could we add?
[10:01:27] <nitrix> CoderGuy, To render a single widget, you need to provide it data. To render a widget that contain other widgets, it needs to receive "structured" data (that you can call a model).
[10:01:57] <CoderGuy> literally just having a second widget so 2 textbox?
[10:02:02] <CoderGuy> okay lets add a button
[10:02:11] <CoderGuy> so a textbox and a submit button

[10:03:08] <CoderGuy> sure
[10:03:18] <nitrix> The functionalities that the widgets let you do, they transform some data somewhere.

[10:18:16] <nitrix> CoderGuy, From the perspective of someone just touching a view, they can add multiple widgets, organize them, layout, decide that entering text in one widget updates some models, that clicking on a button sets a flag somewhere, etc. It also decides what widgets receives what information from what is available to the view.
[10:18:17] <CoderGuy> which again says, that inside your GUI layer exists objects that have both views and models IE the textbox textdata versus the textbox display

[10:18:36] <CoderGuy> CoderGuy as the label for my username
[10:19:01] <PlanckWalk> It has a reference to a model, the model isn't part of the view.

[10:19:34] <Trashlord> rindolf: ok
[10:19:39] <CoderGuy> the GUI Layer will have a mix, and that's fine so long as the mix is relative to the properties of displaying things, the model data is outside of it when you have data to give to the GUI layer
[10:19:46] <nitrix> CoderGuy, Well, it combines widgets, does setup to glue models to views.
[10:20:01] <CoderGuy> yeah I understand
[10:20:04] <nitrix> Err, glue models to widgets.
[10:20:36] <CoderGuy> model data is data you give to the view which then the view turns into display data, said display data will have objects that appear to mix both model/view but that's okay GUI objects have their own personal model data that they then render to display
[10:20:58] <CoderGuy> the personal data being things like textbox.text;
[10:21:24] <CoderGuy> notice how textbox.text is not textbox.firstname as that would be illogical, firstname is stored outside of the textbox in a model which is sent to a view, which then assigns said data to the textbox

[10:23:25] <CoderGuy> yeah nitrix I understand there are some interesting rules once you're inside the GUI Layer
[10:23:27] <nitrix> A color picker can store X/Y coordinates of a dropper on a palette, maybe even favorited colors, but once you pick, it just emits/callback a single color.
[10:23:48] <CoderGuy> yeah yeah it makes sense nitrix I get it, you have to look at what layer you're in
[10:23:54] <nitrix> Hence the widget has its own internal data, and the view can glue the widget events to the right model the way it wants.
[10:23:59] <CoderGuy> i'm literally in the tools that draw things layer, so these concepts don't apply the same way
[10:24:21] <CoderGuy> yes makes sense
[10:24:36] <CoderGuy> I see now, the model becomes apparent when you leave the GUI layer and are looking at where data goes

[10:24:55] <CoderGuy> so you don't want to like tangle up your username within a textbox, but I already follow this rule
[10:25:06] <nitrix> The model is the data, and how you read/write to the data.
[10:25:08] <CoderGuy> only textbox data will be inside a textbox
[10:25:19] <CoderGuy> nitrix, but not all of it, cuz the textbox has it's own data, that's what confused me
[10:25:36] *** Joins: gggpkm_ (~gggpkm@60.10.194.47)
[10:25:45] <PlanckWalk> Yep.  It would be possible to write code that has something like  getUsername() { userLabel.getText(); }  but that's usually horrible :)
[10:25:53] <nitrix> Right, but you're not gonna have a "FirstName" model.
[10:26:01] <CoderGuy> oh yeah maybe user
[10:26:10] <nitrix> You'll have a TextBox widget with JUST the firstname, or a "User" model that has the firstName.
[10:26:17] <CoderGuy> yeah
[10:26:22] <CoderGuy> I see I get it, man so confusing
[10:26:41] <CoderGuy> I still think you could seperate things a bit but it sounds like this more applies to assuming you have a way to view things
[10:27:02] <nitrix> That's what I meant earlier. The widgets at the very end of this, only have a tiny bit of information. Sometimes they don't even have their own copy of the information, they just read it directly from a model.
[10:27:16] <CoderGuy> yeah nitrix idk why it's hard to grasp at first

[10:27:21] <nitrix> "from a model" meaning a view extracted it first and passed it to the widget when came to the time to be rendered.
[10:27:24] <CoderGuy> it's really simple in the end but yeah
[10:28:02] <nitrix> (not that the widget literally knows about a User, that'd be dumb)
[10:28:07] <CoderGuy> I still think a textbox could techincally send itself to a renderer and have it rendered this way, but I really like having hte paint method be a part of the textbox object and just remembinerg "well it's a GUI object so of course it can paint itself"

[10:29:19] <CoderGuy> so games are given game objects that they then render?
[10:29:21] <PlanckWalk> Heh yes, I was about to say that it's common in games
[10:29:29] <CoderGuy> does unity do this?
[10:29:42] <nitrix> CoderGuy, Or sometimes you have "primitives", like lines, triangles, circles, and the widgets draw with these, or create a list of things to draw and a renderer eventually draw those.

[10:33:04] <nitrix> CoderGuy, It's to avoid unnecessary state updates / work. Suppose your widgets are all self-contained, then the input widget has to set the background color, draw the background, set the font color, switch to that font, draw the font, change color again, maybe do the border, maybe change color again, do the shadow.
[10:33:56] <nitrix> CoderGuy, Now, if you have multiple widgets like that, you're doing these font/color switching all the time, when you would much rather change color once, draw everything with that color, change font, draw everything that needs that font.

[10:34:01] <nitrix> Basically batch process stuff.
[10:34:33] <CoderGuy> I see
[10:34:39] <CoderGuy> so nitrix lets say I have a combination of 2 framework objects
[10:34:54] <CoderGuy> is that just a view even though it's a combination of 2?
[10:35:16] <CoderGuy> so to be more sepcific lets say I have a Label and a Textbox
[10:35:25] <CoderGuy> and I call this LabelBox
[10:35:40] <CoderGuy> but inside LabelBox{ Label; TextBox;}
[10:35:54] <CoderGuy> and I literally just create them and then assign them data etc

[10:36:55] <CoderGuy> but essentially, is LabelBox just acting the same way a TextBox would or a Label Would?
[10:37:06] <nitrix> If the LabelBox can receive data and render itself, it's a view. If it can emit events/have callbacks, it's a widget.
[10:37:13] <nitrix> Yours can do both!

[10:38:09] <CoderGuy> if the Textbox and the Label exist inside say the Win32 framework

[10:39:04] <CoderGuy> so it's up to the GUI Framework you're using as to how things are rendered
[10:39:07] *** Joins: bcount`d (~tr3z@32.211.211.39)
[10:39:19] <CoderGuy> even if you add a paint method, ultimately said paint method is subject to the GUI Framework you're using
[10:39:50] <nitrix> Well yeah. "Rendering" can mean doing your own OpenGL calls, as much as it can mean using another gui library and just keeping handles.
[10:39:52] <CoderGuy> yeah, so unless i'm actually creating how things get painted, it's up to the GUI Framework
[10:40:08] *** Quits: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[10:40:23] <nitrix> When your widget updates, in reality to asks the other library to update the widget. When the other library's widget emits event, then it's converted into events for your own framework.
[10:40:31] <nitrix> That's an abstraction.
[10:40:34] <CoderGuy> yeah I see
[10:40:39] <CoderGuy> okay so i'm working with abstraction then
[10:40:48] <CoderGuy> cuz i'm not trying to tell windows how to paint stuff etc
[10:41:02] <nitrix> You hide that you're using another library. From the user's perspective, your widget renders itself with data and emits events like it should.
[10:41:06] <CoderGuy> so i'm using an existing framework and thus i'm subject to how they do it
[10:41:15] <nitrix> They don't have to know that it's Win32 API or OpenGL, or whatever.
[10:41:26] <CoderGuy> yeah i'm okay with this just trying to grasp what is happening
[10:42:10] <nitrix> Yes. How disgusting the library you're using is will affect your own library for sure.
[10:42:12] <CoderGuy> okay and then we tend to use frameworks that handle the paints for us
[10:42:31] <CoderGuy> like I can't remember having to tell a textbox to paint, you just add it to the form or whatever and presto
[10:42:38] <CoderGuy> but that's cuz that's how the framework deals with it
[10:43:12] <nitrix> For example for OpenGL, when you change a color, it remembers the color, so if I was using OpenGL, all my widgets would always have to reset the color before/after they're done to avoid breaking other widgets.
[10:43:24] *** Joins: password2 (~password@user/password2)
[10:43:27] <CoderGuy> I see nitrix
[10:43:42] <CoderGuy> yeah, okay so this layer is fine i'll leave that subject to whatever framework is picked for drawing stuff
[10:43:54] <nitrix> Or use a single renderer like I mentioned earlier, or have a flag to let me know if I have to reset or keep track of the current color.
[10:44:07] <nitrix> (Internally).
[10:44:08] <CoderGuy> yeah that stuff is beyond what i'm trying to code in
[10:44:27] <CoderGuy> but it's good to know, if I ever wanted to try to outdo the framework I could attempt it or get a team or something
[10:44:39] <CoderGuy> but the frameworks i'm using allow me to pretty much paint anything so
[10:44:55] <nitrix> Color is simple. It's worse when it's textures, or sound, or fonts, things that are slower, or that are blocking/asynchronous when your library isn't.
[10:45:01] *** Joins: rapirent__ (~tony@123-195-196-153.dynamic.kbronet.com.tw)
[10:45:10] <CoderGuy> yeah that's i'll leave that to the experts
[10:45:38] <CoderGuy> for now it seems like i'm using objects that already exist in other frameworks even if i'm making my own i'm relying on the framework which is totally fine it's just recognizing that's what is happening
[10:46:15] <CoderGuy> so then these are GUI Objects from the framework, and it's key to seperate them from the model, which I was doing to begin with just tyring to see
[10:46:19] <nitrix> Anyway, gonna head to bed. Hope it gives you a bit of direction even though it's very layman and abstract.
[10:46:25] <CoderGuy> nono nitrix honestly 100% solved
[10:46:37] <CoderGuy> very helpful, i'm just ya know double checking it makes complete sense though

[10:47:19] <nitrix> It's just my opinion. Some framework try new techniques, have different abstractions and crap too.
[10:47:22] <CoderGuy> the best part is by doing this I can code it to work with mobile or desktop and not worry about the difference in devices
[10:47:44] <nitrix> But it's the basic. You separate things as much as you can, with the data flowing between them.
[10:47:50] <CoderGuy> yeah yeah sure, i'm just seeing how you can by keeping the model out of the view then also set your view to match the device
[10:48:17] <CoderGuy> and I see more and more like "well of course, I mean how would I even compile for mobile using desktop" so yeah

[10:48:39] <CoderGuy> my objects are one layer removed, but still view objects nayways yee gnight :D
[10:49:33] <CoderGuy> in conclusion, I have objects that represent GUI Layer, but said objects are then told what framework to use to draw things and since those objects are gonna handle the drawing well this is technically solved, then I just code my views to use my objects and said objects are then attached to a given gui framework

[12:53:29] <selina> ash_m: Are the decorators similar to decorators in Python?
[12:54:01] <Arahael> selina: Decorators in python are a bit of a curious python-specific interpretation.
[12:54:31] <ash_m> selina, my guess is "no"
[12:55:20] <selina> rindolf: I remember reading about cache memoization in "Higher Order Perl". That doesn't need another syntactical construct. Mark Jason Dominus already wrote a library for that.
[12:55:41] <selina> ash_m: https://perldoc.perl.org/Memoize
[12:55:55] <Arahael> selina: Specifically, the decorator pattern usually refers to dynamically modifying an *object*, adding additionanl behaviours to it.  But in python, it refers to wrapping a *function or class*, and thus, effectively applies to all instances, not just the one.

[12:56:30] <selina> Arahael: It's OOP. It already goes over my head.
[12:56:38] <ash_m> But the concept is just stuffing one class into another with some additional fumctionality, while keeping the functionality of the class you stuffed in

[13:04:34] <selina> RedCrab: Many languages omit the "is" in every sentences. It's implied. That's what happens in English sometimes too. Either it's that or it's an exclamation. The point stands, though.

[13:30:00] <mrig> When did Gerunding start in English, anyone have any idea of the grammatical origins?
[13:30:19] <mrig> RedCrab: lol
[13:30:25] <PlanckWalk> Wayyy before English.
[13:30:35] <selina> PlanckWalk: Well, whatever helps you console yourself since you never had the good fortune to read Kernighan, or any other classics.
[13:30:38] <PlanckWalk> E.g. latin is full of gerunds
[13:30:49] <mrig> oh is it, how vulgar!
[13:30:56] <RedCrab> HA
[13:31:02] <PlanckWalk> selina: I've read K&R and plenty of others.
[13:31:08] <PlanckWalk> You make a lot of assumptions.
[13:31:16] <mrig> sounds logical that formalised grammar would come after this kind of device.
[13:32:15] <selina> PlanckWalk: That's a tragedy, then. I think you would have adopted some good practices from them. You probably had it all brainwashed out when you joined a job that needed Java or C++. I don't think it's your mistake, for what it's worth. It's the industry.
[13:32:19] <PlanckWalk> selina: You seem desperate to attempt ad hominem.
[13:32:21] <mrig> grammar being a kind of emergent pattern, somewhat like design patterns.
[13:32:36] <mrig> the facade pattern is underrated.
[13:32:38] <PlanckWalk> Instead of actually dealing with the topic.
[13:32:56] <mrig> describes JavaScript and python really well.
[13:33:01] <selina> PlanckWalk: It's the people who write the code. Human mindset is an important part of it. I'm not attacking you personally.
[13:33:03] <beaky> can grammar be dependently typed like how we have dependently typed progamming languages
[13:33:17] <selina> PlanckWalk: It's a trope.
[13:33:35] <selina> PlanckWalk: Corporate programmer. The languages are designed for minimal damage.
[13:33:40] <mrig> beaky: I think that it exists in nomenclature when the programmer is attentive enough.
[13:34:02] <RedCrab> is swearing allowed in this channel?
[13:34:05] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[13:34:17] <mrig> RedCrab: I will swear you in.
[13:34:20] <RedCrab> selina: No offense, but you're coming off like a bit of a dick to PlanckWalk here
[13:34:48] <selina> RedCrab: I'm not opposed to PlanckWalk personally or anyone else.
[13:35:02] <RedCrab> That makes it a bit worse :\
[13:35:10] <selina> RedCrab: And you intended plenty of offense. Admit it.
[13:35:33] <selina> PlanckWalk: Which language do you actually write code in?
[13:35:45] <RedCrab> I didn't intend any. But reading what you want into people's words is part of what makes you look dickish right now
[13:35:51] <mrig> so, the facade pattern, is the singleton now thought of as an antipattern in regards to facade pattern?
[13:36:09] <mrig> or do we accept it still works in this context?
[13:36:12] <selina> RedCrab: If you didn't intend offense, a simple "rude" or even "aggressive" would suffice.
[13:36:45] <RedCrab> those aren't things I would say
[13:36:46] <beaky> singleton is an antipattern because of the facade that it could be abstracted but isnt i think
[13:36:46] <selina> RedCrab: But, swear all you want.

[13:38:17] <PlanckWalk> You answer my question first.
[13:38:37] <selina> PlanckWalk: Well, I asked first.
[13:38:47] <PlanckWalk> You mis-asked.
[13:38:56] <PlanckWalk> Using a question with a broken premise.
[13:39:51] <selina> PlanckWalk: I'm sorry you have been scarred for life. Not admitting which language you use for fear of mockery is beyond belief. I've seen brilliant programmer who programmed on Java in Windows and were not ashamed to admit it.
[13:39:53] <PlanckWalk> ALso I note your "reassuring" note which is actually a sign of poor faith discussion.
[13:40:02] <PlanckWalk> Again you assume the singular.
[13:40:07] <selina> s/programmer/programmers/
[13:40:17] <PlanckWalk> Are you familiar with the concept of using and being proficient in a range of programming languages?
[13:40:20] <selina> Name however many you like.
[13:40:53] <RedCrab> I'm guessing the question is being asked in order to prove you don't know what you're talking about?
[13:41:11] <PlanckWalk> Sure, after you tell me whether you use only one language, as you implied is the norm in your question.
[13:41:16] <selina> RedCrab: Certainly not. I'm just curious.
[13:41:21] <PlanckWalk> I doubt it.
[13:41:38] <PlanckWalk> You're acting personally hostile.
[13:41:53] <RedCrab> The best reply to "What language do you program in" is "The one that pays me better" :P
[13:42:42] <RedCrab> there's nothing wrong with coding in Java. I have work to do at $COMPANY, and it's used and understood by millions of people. It pays for my housing and food.
[13:42:44] <beaky> how did the object oriented programmer get paid? inheritance
[13:42:52] <RedCrab> HA
[13:42:57] <RedCrab> beaky, you're on a roll
[13:43:16] <selina> PlanckWalk: Poor poor man! I pity you. Not everybody is there to attack you. Do you want my answer first so you feel better equipped to defend yourself, baby? I like Perl, C and Haskell the most. I'm trying to learn Clojure but if asked from a real world perspective, Perl and now Raku is my favourite.
[13:43:19] <beaky> yes wish i could get paid each time i inherit
[13:43:59] <RedCrab> selina: doesn't Clojure run on the JVM?
[13:44:02] <beaky> nice i like clojure
[13:44:06] <selina> PlanckWalk: If you still feel defensive, I think you need therapy.
[13:44:12] <beaky> just from rich hickey's talks
[13:44:19] <selina> RedCrab: Yes, it does. That's one of it's strengths, I suppose.
[13:44:25] <PlanckWalk> So being familiar with multiple languages, why did you imply that I only use one language?
[13:44:38] <PlanckWalk> I'm pretty sure that you're beyond therapy.
[13:45:14] <selina> PlanckWalk: I assumed you wrote only one language in job. That's why I asked about job and personal separately. I think you're now mining hidden insults in my questions too.
[13:45:46] <PlanckWalk> Then followed up with another question that implied the same.
[13:45:48] <selina> RedCrab: But I'm very unfamiliar with JVM. That's what was the hurdle initially.
[13:45:52] <RedCrab> selina: JVM is both a strength and weakness... I've had many a night trying to debug JVM apps that love to die/hang/eviscerate memory for some reason
[13:45:54] <PlanckWalk> So yeah, "you're just curious:
[13:45:59] <PlanckWalk> Right.
[13:46:02] <selina> PlanckWalk: Go on. Make stupid assumptions.
[13:46:16] <PlanckWalk> You already did, I have no need to repeat the error.
[13:46:21] <selina> RedCrab: Yeah, the stack traces too can be daunting.
[13:47:17] <selina> PlanckWalk: Is it C#? Or PHP? I won't consider you an idiot by what language you use? I only asked so I could invite you to explore either a different facet of the same language or a better similar language altogether.
[13:47:30] <selina> use.*
[13:47:46] <RedCrab> haha, there are far worse languages than C# and PHP
[13:47:47] <PlanckWalk> I'm familiar with both, but currently use neither.
[13:48:41] <selina> RedCrab: Although, from a serious real practical perspective, JVM is indispensable to learn. Not all programming is beautiful. The lack of libraries can be difficult to handle.
[13:48:55] <RedCrab> selina: ????
[13:49:15] <RedCrab> Not sure what you're calling a library in this instance, but there are probably more "libraries" for the JVM than any other langauge
[13:49:23] <selina> PlanckWalk: Yet you are so scarred that you won't tell me which do you use. That's what's funny about it.

[13:57:06] <RedCrab> selina: I've looked into it (Haskell, that is). When choosing my own language, I tend to avoid languages with either GC or null (or bottom, as you call it)

[13:58:36] <mrig> OOP in C is awesome for avoiding cyclical dependencies, and helping to organise code, does not mean that you do it all the time, use a facade whenever that suites.
[13:58:52] <selina> mrig: i concur with the sentiment. but since i'm not well-versed with the software engineering terminology in vogue, i probably won't get what you're saying without concrete example.
[13:59:23] <selina> RedCrab: rust is popular now, sure.

[14:00:14] <mrig> This was what was happening apparently that lead to languages adopting certain syntactical sugar.
[14:01:08] <mrig> But without the notion of granularity, this collapses; Design patterns does cover this quite well.
[14:02:06] <mrig> I disliked Java when I first tried it, because the OOP was a little too forwards in the language, and I not ready to appreciate it.
[14:02:51] <selina> mrig: oop is like that as well. it's another term that has lost all meaning.
[14:03:03] <selina> mrig: like liberalism, or fascism.
[14:03:12] <mrig> I think so yes, these actual sense of it has changed.
[14:03:42] <mrig> I find that studying the history of things when you can helps to set a good perspective.
[14:03:44] <selina> mrig: it's a red herring. they don't exist. anything and everything is oop. oop is when you don't like something. it's also when you like something.

[14:43:46] <W> programming is a craft especially because it has techniques and practices that can be taught to anyone, and that gets picked up simply by practicing it
[14:44:18] <W> mrig, that was not at all what I said either and you should probably stop formulating your sentences to imply I said anything at all
[14:44:36] <mrig> you cant teach everyone to make musical instrument, why would it be possible for code?

[14:45:36] <mrig> kmh: yes exactly, my point.
[14:46:01] <Arahael> ash_m: what was the question?
[14:46:03] <mrig> Arahael, craft and craftsman are synonymous.

[14:46:35] <mrig> that W mentions gender, may be due to my use of man I don't know, it was not stated.
[14:46:42] <ash_m> The question was can you decorate mofels
[14:46:45] <Arahael> mrig: there are a few different ways those words can be interpreted, but in this context i am agreeing with w.
[14:46:45] <kmh> and while you can make "can teach everyone to do it" may not be false but is imho a bit problematic
[14:46:45] <mrig> I use man, as an abbreviation of human.
[14:46:47] <W> mrig, I also have not mentioned gender
[14:46:53] <ash_m> Ugh... keyboard

[14:51:38] <W> mrig, I meant it in the context of the suggestion that programming is an art, and if you're not an "artist" at it, you're somehow deficient. Programming is a craft, in that you are using passed down and trained skill that improve with experience, to produce practical results

[14:52:49] <Arahael> mrig: Having done some arts, I would disagree, they have more in common than you'd expect.
[14:52:55] <W> basically, I dislike suggestions that aesthetics is very important in programming, or even a sense of "elegance" or similar; it basically stands in as unreasoned and half-reasoned (though not necessarily incorrect) assessments, that are best served by analysis of outcomes, consequences
[14:53:00] <Arahael> mrig: In that they often consist of techniques.

[14:58:43] <mrig> Arahael: I would agree that there is art to being a great craftsman, one tends to think of modern art on hearing the word art and this has diverged somewhat from other usages, such as say, a marital art.
[14:58:52] <mrig> martial rather :)
[14:59:04] <mrig> marital art being the art of zen.
[14:59:22] <Arahael> mrig: The common understanding as opposed to the technical, literal understanding of the craft, perhaps.
[15:00:46] <RedCrab> W: unfortunately, I think there will be a lot of wisdom from IRC lost in the future. Much as a lot of the BBS chats are vanishing. So each new generation will probably just rehash the same old thing in whatever the current technology is at the time
[15:01:08] <mrig> In the school that I went to, arts and craft were globally mocked; Perhaps this is why I take the stance that the term craftsman has become derogatory. Why this is so is I think particularly pertinent to the subject at hand.
[15:01:22] <W> Given the lack of a very established understanding of the techniques and practices, most of what can be learned reside inside the heads of the people with a decade or two of experience. This doesn't mean that, having to pick the few people you can personally help carefully, that the rest are unsuited to learning.

[16:06:48] <pyzozord> first it sorts the input array, then it creates a binary heap of touples where each tuple is (distance, start, start+1). Then it does a loop k times: pop smallest tuple from the heap, push to the heap "extended" tule with the same start, but end is incremented by 1
[16:06:54] <W> pyzozord, actually yeah that solution DOES work
[16:07:13] <AndroidDAW> https://github.com/mgood7123/prebuilder  re-clarified readme
[16:07:50] <pyzozord> so that k loop it keeps poping smallest distances and at the same time adding larger distances, and just stops after k times
[16:07:52] <W> for the reason I noted earlier, it's just not super clear /why/ (it could use a proof), given it only extends upwards - but if the upward extension is in the k best, then the "downward extension" from the previous would have already been added because that sub-distance is also in the k best
[16:09:08] <pyzozord> W: I'm not following that. It seems to me that you confused k and distances somehow
[16:10:15] <W> consider 1,4,7,8,11,14,16,17,20,21,24 for k=4; you start by looking at 7,11 and 16,20, but then you get to 14,17
[16:11:12] <W> just because you already considered 16,17 upwards doesn't mean the "downward" extension to 14 is missed, because 14,16 is also already in the 4 best, necessarily

[18:05:57] <pyzozord> rindolf: hahah
[18:06:52] <pyzozord> Guest9: possibly I never tried that, but I would adviced against that, just do whatever is the most popular - it will be the most supported thing when you run into problems. After you get comfortable with the tech you can start experimenting
[18:07:16] <kodah> Guest9: docker is a general purpose daemon and CLI for interacting with containers. containers are different on macos, windows, and linux, but linux is by far the most popular imlementation.
[18:07:46] <Guest9> so far i never need docker, but based on some reviews i found that manim installation is bit tricky, so i read somewhere it is possible to use docker.
[18:07:47] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: the main reason is that damned interview, the second reason is I feel really stupid for not being even average at them
[18:07:56] <Guest9> so does it mean installing it using docker is easy?
[18:08:35] <pyzozord> Guest9: yeah the most popular way of installing it and using it is very streamlined and easy
[18:08:52] <kodah> Guest9: containers are not "easy". you can bring containers up fairly easy, but that's the "hello world" of infrastructure.
[18:09:17] <GeDaMo> They're artificial problems, not necessarily connected to anything you'd have to do in a job

[20:48:14] <mrig> pyzozord: oh that's a shame, I had my fingers crossed for that to work, but alas it seems not.
[20:48:15] <pyzozord> mrig: browsers have a built int layouting system based on html and css. Positions, and dimentions are calculated automatically based on tree relationship of the DOM nodes and css rules. That's the mindset you should adopt. You almost never calculate how long your text is, rather you operate on css properties like precentage width or flexbox flow model
[20:48:46] <mrig> pyzozord: oh I want to code a terminal though, will need to consider this for that.
[20:49:06] <pyzozord> mrig: I mean you can for sure do it manually setting pixles coordinates and dimentions in javascript, but you have much higher level constructs available at your disposal
[20:49:20] <mrig> The issue on an iframe brought the thought to the front of my mind as it is similar.
[20:49:27] <pyzozord> oh you want to code a terminal emulator in a browser

[20:50:37] <pyzozord> they have multiple rendering modes, one purly based on html dom, and one for 2d/webgl rendering
[20:51:25] <mrig> GeDaMo: That is an interesting thought, would need to translate from a tree into a matrix I suppose. Need the text dimensions for this.
[20:51:44] <GeDaMo> Yeah, I thought storing a bounding box for each character would be a bit much
[20:51:47] <pyzozord> mrig: you have several ways to go about it, the html dom way is certainly the easiest but it will also have the slowest refresh rate - if you are aiming at 60 fps with 300x300 characters on screen html dom is the wrong choice
[20:51:51] <GeDaMo> But maybe that's what happens
[20:52:23] <pyzozord> (60 fps refresh rate)
[20:52:26] <p0g0_> mrig, you may have a tk tool, "dialog" that will let you construct a text box dialog with simple "buttons"

[20:53:07] <pyzozord> I sent the wrong repo, this is the right one https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js
[20:53:28] <p0g0_> yeah, if you treat the fonts string as a fixed length, any change to the font or rendering engines may do that.
