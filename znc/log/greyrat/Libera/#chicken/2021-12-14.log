[11:12:40] <s-liao> All those print functions like (write-u8)  in srfi-4  and (write-bytevector) in chicken.io module, they all ended up calling like  ((##sys#slot (##sys#slot p 2) 2) p c).
[11:15:39] <s-liao> Which sound like work for from 127 to 255.

[16:50:43] <s-liao> wasamasa do you have to look at it?
[16:50:55] <wasamasa> I don't have to, no
[16:51:07] <wasamasa> honestly, I don't get why you're looking so deeply into encoding
[16:51:16] <s-liao> Have time to look at it
[16:51:23] <s-liao> sorry
[16:51:41] <Bunny351> s-liao: what exactly are you trying to do?
[16:51:42] <wasamasa> ultimately, it's a matter of being very precise about when you're using native and utf8 versions of library calls
[16:52:03] <wasamasa> the utf8 egg is not an easy way to get utf8 support, to the contrary
[16:54:30] <s-liao> Bunny351 Not really do anything. Just figure out what is the root cause for what I found out.
[16:54:48] <s-liao> wasamasa Thanks for your comments
[16:54:54] <sjamaan> wasamasa: Why isn't that considered easy?  To me it seems the most transparent way to get this
[16:56:14] <wasamasa> it is easy until it ceases working :D
[16:56:17] <sjamaan> haha
[16:56:42] <wasamasa> then you start debugging and discover that in some chain of string transformations, the incorrect version of a procedure is used
[16:57:11] <s-liao> Most of the solution for a certain program, it is about figuring out the root cause.
[16:57:38] <wasamasa> for example in plucky I resorted to importing starred versions of non-utf8 procedures and use them in the few cases where I need to work in terms of bytes rather than utf8 codepoints
[16:58:05] <wasamasa> like when working with binary data, which is not utf8
[16:58:29] <wasamasa> something like python's approach might be less painful
[16:58:43] <wasamasa> where you use two separate data types in the APIs
[16:58:54] <wasamasa> r7rs goes into that direction with its emphasis on bytevectors
[16:59:05] <sjamaan> yeah, that's pretty good. It was just the transition from 2 to 3 which sucked hard
[16:59:44] <wasamasa> surprisingly enough, most code I write benefits from not using the utf8 egg
[16:59:51] <wasamasa> there's like two or three exceptions where it would
[17:00:33] <wasamasa> I thought about which option to go for with depp and settled for no utf8, because it's not like file names or git care about encoding
[17:01:08] <wasamasa> when I tested file name length limits, I found that using a multibyte encoding is counterproductive
[17:15:57] <s-liao> Yes
[17:25:38] <s-liao> Basically, (import (only (scheme base) string->utf8), (string->utf8 (string #\xCC))  ->#u8(204) , it is not correct. it should be  ->#u8(195 132)
[17:28:22] <s-liao> And also print function in scheme only support ASCII code.
[17:31:19] <s-liao> Same like have utf8 egg solve everything, but it override print ,make-string, write-char. it like almost kill everything.
[17:32:28] <s-liao> Seem like. not same like
