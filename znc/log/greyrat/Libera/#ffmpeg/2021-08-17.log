[00:10:52] <JEEB> I hope you have actually verified that the encoder is actually doing something wrong before going off on this chase :D
[00:10:54] <GuiToris> hello, how can I list what hardware acceleration I can use?
[00:11:57] <PatIIci> JEEB : quicktime can't play the encoded videos on my macintosh IIci
[00:12:34] <JEEB> fun. what's the container out of interest?
[00:13:23] <PatIIci> .mov
[00:14:37] <JEEB> OK. one might have to check if the MOV/MP4 writer in FFmpeg actually writes something that such old software doesn't support. I'm not sure that's a common test subject :D
[00:14:59] <JEEB> like, just making sure it's the actual video encoding that's making it fail, not some unknown structures or whatever in the container
[00:15:13] <JEEB> not sure how nice errors you can get out of QT or whatever you're trying to play it with :)
[00:15:54] <PatIIci> unfortunately the player I'm using isn't very talkative about what's wrong about the input file
[00:16:53] <JEEB> yup. I would kind of expect the actual video format to be correct since I'd expect that to be the one thing the encoder author would actually care about :D while the container etc stuff might be less relevant.
[00:17:12] <JEEB> but yea, good luck. you could compare it against any FATE samples if the format has any

Are there benchmarks or whatever that could help me calculate how much faster is an i7 than an i3 CPU?
[17:13:35] <JEEB> It Depends, but your best bets is to see if any benchmark that contains x265 has any similar CPUs with data
[17:15:00] <GuiToris> do you happen to have an i7 cpu?
[17:15:16] <JEEB> I used to, but it was a 4790K
[17:15:25] *** Parts: twiswist (~twiswist@user/twiswist) ()
[17:15:27] <JEEB> there is not a single i7 CPU, there's a *lot* of different ones, you know :D
[17:18:19] <GuiToris> I know there isn't a single answer to this question, but I've never used other cpus than this one and it's hard to figure out how faster it could be

[17:25:05] <GuiToris> I need to encode very very long videos, I'm not sure if it's possible to do so in 2 days
[17:25:58] <GuiToris> can libx265 veryslow ever be faster than 1x?
[17:27:00] <arvernes> Hi, I want to convert subtitles file from vtt to srt, but it gives me an error : ffmpeg -i file.vtt file.srt
[17:28:58] <GuiToris> arvernes, one time only? https://www.veed.io/tools/vtt-to-srt
[17:31:03] <arvernes> GuiToris, yeap, I used it to convert it, and it worked, but I don't understand why ffmpeg doesn't. I got this message "Output file is empty, nothing was encoded (check -ss / -t / -frames parameters if used)
[17:31:04] <arvernes> "
[17:31:54] <GuiToris> I've never done anything like that, but if you don't do this regularly it might be quicker if you just choose and alternative solution, like the one I linked
[17:36:14] <BtbN> GuiToris, running your command on a 64 Core EPYC server, I got 0.11x speed.
[17:37:52] <BtbN> though keep in mind that video encoding does not really scale that wide
[17:43:16] <GuiToris> BtbN, thank you very much
[17:43:52] <BtbN> A high-clocked 8 core Ryzen would likely outperform that EPYC
[17:44:00] <BtbN> but also not get close to real time speeds
[17:45:12] <GuiToris> we have a lot of family videos that would like to encode, it probably wouldn't finish them within a week
[17:45:34] <GuiToris> I'm checking what fast cloud instance is

[17:49:41] <Hello72> x265 optimum is usually "slow"
[17:49:53] <Hello72> you can't just copy x264 settings to x265
[17:50:47] <Hello72> you should at least benchmark which settings have roughly the right speed and quality

[17:55:06] <GuiToris> Hello72, I didn't see the actual computer, I just found a company that would rent one
[17:55:19] <Hello72> reduce the quality of your video then
[17:55:28] <Hello72> you don't even set -crf
[17:55:35] <Hello72> what kind of test is this
[17:55:45] <GuiToris> a rough one
[17:56:02] <GuiToris> I didn't decide if 27 or 26 yet
[17:56:12] <GuiToris> the default is 28
[17:57:34] <GuiToris> but I got an answer, I was merely asking if I could encode say 100hours of videos in a day, but it doesn't seem to be possible
[17:57:52] <Hello72> i mean you can if you turn up the speed
[17:57:54] <GuiToris> I'm thinking of renting it for a week then and encode as much as it's just possible
[17:58:58] <GuiToris> it's really problematic to share large videos, and I'm not going to reduce the quality either
[17:59:16] <GuiToris> I really satisfied with x265 but it's slow... well I guess it's meant to be slow
[17:59:30] *** Joins: xqq (~xqq@240b:10:a2a2:4500:de75:da5b:d508:1e01)
[17:59:33] <Hello72> did you check if veryslow is actually better quality
[17:59:41] <BtbN> GuiToris, HEVC is not that much more efficient than h264
[17:59:48] <Hello72> different speed also may need different crf
[17:59:56] <BtbN> you're not gonna dramatically reduce the size just by using HEVC over h264
[18:00:41] <GuiToris> my only source is the wiki that you created 'libx265 which can offer around 25–50% bitrate savings compared to H.264 video encoded with libx265'
[18:00:48] <Hello72> unless you also reduce the quality or significantly decrease the speed
[18:00:54] <GuiToris> lib264*
[18:01:22] <Hello72> so you didn't test different preset or different crf, just guessing?
[18:01:45] <GuiToris> I go through from -crf 26-30
[18:02:08] <GuiToris> I meant I 'went'
[18:02:19] <GuiToris> and 26 and 27 were acceptable
[18:02:30] <GuiToris> I used -preset slower
[18:03:17] <GuiToris> so I hoped if slower 27 was okay then veryslow 27 would be excellent
[18:03:53] <BtbN> x264 with decent preset and crf 20 or something will likely be just as good visually, and a ton faster.
[18:04:07] <GuiToris> I'll give it try
[18:04:23] <GuiToris> but I assume it'll be huge
[18:04:58] <BtbN> No idea on what basis you assume that.
[18:05:18] <BtbN> Use proper settings, and not defaults. Those suck for either encoder.
[18:07:23] <GuiToris> I've never really dared to use x264. One time I encoded a 1080p 30min long footage which was nearly 500mb, and I found that incredibly big
[18:07:50] <BtbN> 500mb for 30min of 1080p is what I'd consider ultra-low-bitrate
[18:07:51] <GuiToris> it's funny that nobody as obsessed with x265 as I am
[18:08:03] <BtbN> you normally aim for ~10Mbit/s for 1080p60. At the bare minimum.
[18:08:57] <GuiToris> uhh
[18:09:34] <Hello72> theoretically x265 crf size matches x264 but quality should be same 4 stops down or something
[18:09:46] <Hello72> in practice it depends on your video and your impression of quality
[18:10:19] <GuiToris> I'll try x264
[18:10:22] <BtbN> yeah, you can encode a high quality chess game at <1Mbit/s for 4K video :D

[18:14:51] <BtbN> Old TVs.
[18:15:18] <BtbN> That's literally the only reason why it exists. Analog TV worked like that, so it was dragged over into the digital world for some reason.

[18:23:30] <GuiToris> furq, fortunately 29.97 is not standard here
[18:23:47] <GuiToris> although my camera records in that framerate
[18:24:20] <furq> well yuv and 4:2:0 are of the same vintage although they still make pretty good sense
[18:24:40] <furq> those guys in 1950 were pretty smart
[18:25:24] <BtbN> For 480
[18:25:32] <BtbN> p and stuff it made sense to have backward compat
[18:25:39] <BtbN> but why 1080i is a thing...
[18:25:44] <furq> japan maybe
[18:26:01] <furq> although crt hdtvs did make it to the west
[18:26:09] <BtbN> We have 1080i50 OTA stations in Germany
[18:26:47] <furq> yeah same here
[18:27:00] <GuiToris> but i50 is deinterlaced back to 25fps, isn't it?
[18:27:05] <furq> no
[18:27:11] <furq> most tvs will deinterlace it to 50p
[18:27:19] <BtbN> if you deinterlace it, you get 50 fps progressive
[18:27:20] <furq> which is why sports channels tend to be interlaced
[18:27:24] <GuiToris> oh, okay, it makes a little more sense then
[18:27:46] <BtbN> The sports channels here opted for 720p50 instead
[18:27:55] <furq> that probably makes more sense
[18:28:10] <BtbN> It's basically all there is here
[18:28:13] <furq> in either case you're losing a bit of detail for more fluid motion
[18:28:14] <BtbN> either 720p or 1080i
[18:28:23] <furq> and also you're not having to use 1080p50 bandwidth which is the actual reason

[18:29:50] <GuiToris> yeah, I though they just always doubled the framerate (because the sent half images), but during deinterlacing you would get the normal rate again
[18:30:06] <GuiToris> I guess 50i should cost the same as 25p
[18:30:15] <furq> more or less
[18:31:07] <furq> but you still get 50 fields per second so it looks like 50p in motion
[18:31:22] <BtbN> Depends how well your TV deinterlaces it
[18:31:27] <furq> yeah ideally of course
[18:31:38] <furq> and you can't really tell you've lost half the vertical resolution in motion
[18:31:44] <furq> again ideally

[20:09:40] <JEEB> Hime: it seems DPL2 is implemented in swresample, with the matrix_encoding option, which you can set to "dplii"
[20:09:57] <JEEB> haven't tested nor am I sure which way it's implemented (from 5.1 to stereo or the other way)
[20:10:19] <Hime> yes, but that only seems to for going in one way - from 5.1 -> stereo, not stereo -> 5.1
[20:11:33] <Hime> in fact, it probably makes sense as well for an option so named, since it's "matrix_encoding" rather than "matrix_decoding"
[20:11:55] <JEEB> sure
[20:12:06] <Hime> for some strange reason there does not appear to be any matrix_decoding option though, as per my difficulty
[20:15:51] <JEEB> there's way to completely manually set things for downmix in libavfilter so pretty sure you can set a command line for what you need
[20:16:04] <JEEB> but yes, at least with a cursory glance there's no single-click thing to do what you want out of the box :)

[20:20:19] <JEEB> or upmix I guess in your case?
[20:20:42] <Hime> I did consider the manual approach as per my previous comments (though it really shouldn't be necessary!), but as far as I can tell the main thing that might be missing is being able to phase shift individual channels
[20:20:57] <Hime> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decoder#Dolby_Pro_Logic_II_matrix_(5:2:5)
[20:21:46] <JEEB> you could check what swresample is doing in the three locations AV_MATRIX_ENCODING_DPLII is noted :)
[20:24:11] <Hime> according to that, I need to be able to phase shift the left and right by 90 degrees in either direction for the rears, and nothing else, but I can't see any way to do that either

[22:29:26] <adrianibanez20> Hi. I'm interested in learning more about the ffmpeg capabilities of streaming audio only using the lossless flac codec. Currently I'm only able of uploading segmented ( 10min ) ogg+flac files. And I made some experiments with rtp / rtsp / udp streaming but without success so far. Does someone have a good overview about what is possible with flac?
[22:29:27] <adrianibanez20> Preferably I would have one continuous and long running ogg+flac stream to a specified IP+port
[22:30:19] <furq> sounds like you want icecast

[22:31:46] <jokoon> https://i.imgur.com/OUCrUjc.jpg here is a list of videos that can be made as whatsapp status (green), and others not (red)
[22:31:54] <adrianibanez20> furq: does the icecast protocol make the difference when it comes to ogg+flac streaming?
[22:32:11] <jokoon> I'm incapable of discriminating what video are refused by whatsapp
[22:32:45] <furq> adrianibanez20: it's not a protocol it just serves over http
[22:32:57] <furq> but it's a streaming server that does ogg/flac streaming and ffmpeg can act as a source for it
[22:33:21] <furq> and also it's widely used for netradio stuff
[22:33:30] <adrianibanez20> furq: eg no possibility to make flac+ogg work on a rtsp server?
[22:33:33] <furq> or at least it was when people still used netradio
[22:33:56] <furq> i have no idea, you probably could if you already have an rtsp server
[22:34:32] <furq> ffmpeg can't really do any server stuff though

[22:41:19] <adrianibanez20> furq: Ok. I'll have a look at icecast to understand the difference. I use rtsp streams regularly for debugging purposes

[22:42:23] <jokoon> I have a whatsapp log of their video encoding software (it's provided by the app when you want to report a bug), do you think someone could try to tell me where it goes wrong?
[22:43:30] <jokoon> go things like libmp4muxediting/Unknown or unsupported MP4 file topology
[22:43:39] <jokoon> libmp4muxediting/  The file does not look like a regular ISO/MP4/3GP/3G2 file

[22:44:35] <jokoon> libmp4muxediting/Failed reading in 0 entries of STSZ box
[22:44:51] <adrianibanez20> but I couldn't make it work with flac. If anyone knows how to use rtsp + ogg + flac ... I would be more than interested to understand ;)  So far I only had "Could not write header for output file #0 (incorrect codec parameters ?): Server returned 400 Bad Request" on the ffmpeg binary. And " ERR: invalid SDP: unable to get clock rate of track 0:
