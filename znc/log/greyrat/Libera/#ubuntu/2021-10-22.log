[03:18:05] <TTT> which is great fun

[12:13:28] <Grabunhold> i'm just glad ipxe fixed that for my 2 test systems, but i'm pretty sure some random mainboard will manage to screw that boot path up as well :D
[12:14:15] <TJ-> Grabunhold: possibly, but its more than that. It doesn't support a lot of UEFI standard functionality. Like SecureBoot. The code is basically unimproved since 2015

[12:19:56] <Grabunhold> the "production" version of this setup will mostly serve the nucs, and i have a feeling that their uefi implementation might be a rather competent one (compared to the others, at least).

[19:22:12] <tomreyn> Nitrigaur: about your non-booting FDE installation: have you tried whether it boots fine with secureboot disabled, though? when i have an installation which has more than one complexity in it (here: FDE, "secure boot"), i'd try to separate those if that's possible, see which one works and then look at what's missing to make all components work integrated.

[19:25:25] <Nitrigaur> tomreyn, with FDE, I assume you mean Full Disk Encryption? No, I have not tried disabling Secure Boot. Doing so would disable the Win10 from booting properly and to re-enable that, I would need a very long code that I do not have handy. So I'd rather avoid that, but I do agree with the KISS principle and troubleshooting it with the least complexity possible.

[19:28:05] <branon> so when a user clicks to upload a file in firefox, and nautilus opens up to somewhere 6 directories deep under ~/snap

[19:28:20] <branon> like, is this intentional or
[19:28:35] <branon> because home isn't actually home anymore when this happens
[19:28:36] <Nitrigaur> tomreyn, that's quite alright. No need to apologize, just verifying :-)
[19:28:48] <tomreyn> Nitrigaur: oh that's a dual boot system, i see. that's yet another factor increasing complexity.

[19:43:11] <TJ-> Nitrigaur: I'd want to know what $root and $prefix variables are set to. When using encrypted /boot/ file-system, and GURB unlocks that, it should set root=crypto and prefix=($root)/grub
[19:43:27] <TJ-> sorry, typo, root=crypto0
[19:44:04] <TJ-> Nitrigaur: if that isn't happening then it cannot load the correct (crypto)/grub/grub.cfg that contains the shell scrip that generates GRUBs menu
[19:44:18] <Nitrigaur> TJ-, Since I have tried this more than 4 times already, I have copied all the executable lines I enter, including the LUKS pass phrase and my password for Hexchat to a Veracrypt container on a USB memory stick.
[19:45:35] <Nitrigaur> TJ-, Every next iteration of testing starts with inserting that memory stick, unlocking the Veracrypt container inside and executing the scripts
[19:45:38] <TJ-> Nitrigaur: you know you could test this by booting from a liveISO on USB, setting up a virtual machine (using the UEFI firmware option) pointing at the device where the problem install is, and booting it? Allows some very rapid testing and investigation

[19:47:49] <TJ-> Nitrigaur: to check those values at GRUB shell "echo $root" "echo $prefix"

[21:14:05] <TJ-> Nitrigaur: to access the *system* hypervisor (not unprivileged *user* hypervisor) your $USER needs to be a member of the "libvirt" group.
