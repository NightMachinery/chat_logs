[04:19:00] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: not sure if you remember our discussion from the othr day, but I found the single repo to be quite a problem. the wiki content being branched off causes serious inconsistent issues across different feature branches, and while its supposed to be the only source of truth it ends up having no source of truth in that situation. so looks like its multiple repos for me :)

[04:25:14] <rawtaz> Linkandzelda: ok, i cant really get the picture because i dont know your contents etc. not sure why git branches would be a problem at all, but perhaps youre meaning something else when you say "branched off"

[04:26:03] <rawtaz> lantech19446: why is that? one should be your main branch, the other where e.g. dev and testing happens (ideally you'd have testing and dev as separate branches). or you run dev on main.
[04:26:41] <rawtaz> regardless, do stuff on one and when it's done move the other one up to date with it. as long as one of the two branches only moves in one direction it should be fine
[04:26:53] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: i mean, say in current master I wrote something about the project direction in the wiki. then created a branch for feature X. then wrote in the wiki in master and in feature X. maybe its my bad management but, this created already an inconsistency in documentation. since the project is supposed to evolve, i have to make sure the master has the most up tp date wiki contents. am i mismanaging
[04:26:54] <Linkandzelda> it?
[04:27:08] <lantech19446> rawtaz: I do but somehow even though I pull into my test branch before i do anything it always winds up behind somehow.

[04:28:22] <rawtaz> Linkandzelda: if you do what you said, then youll have changes in both master and featureX branches, right? if those two changes do not conflict with each other, you can merge featureX into master. if they do conflict you can still merge featureX into master but must resolve the conflict as part of the merge, thats normal.
[04:28:42] <rawtaz> Linkandzelda: so use master as the branch that you push finished things into - i.e. master only moves in one direction, forward
[04:28:46] <lantech19446> honestly i'm sure it's a me issue and not a git issue, i think git is fantastic and I just deal with it and follow what the errors tell me to do to correct it.

[04:30:08] <rawtaz> lantech19446: not entirely sure how you mean by the feature branch being behind :D what i do is have my feature branches and before i merge them into master i just rebase them onto lastest master. and i do the same whenever i want the feature branch to have whatever happened in master since last time i kept the feature brach up to date with master. i think that might be waht youre talking about, changes in master making the feature out of date?
[04:30:11] <Linkandzelda> lantech19446: good practice i'd say is to have master be the last good verified working version. then you dont need production branch, unless you want to make double sure that production = whats in production. but thats just as easy as saying master is whats in production right now. if that makes sense? not sure, maybe it doesnt work for you
[04:30:36] <lantech19446> that's what i'm doing now a testing branch and master is prod
[04:30:46] <rawtaz> lantech19446: sooner or later it will start clicking into place, keep having at it and dont be afraid to mess around. you always have the `git reflog` to see your recent commits (that you screwed up lol)

[04:33:46] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: the problem isnt about merging them back, its more like not seeing the content of the wiki in full at one moment. sure, it can be merged back, but only when feature X is done and verified. if all i added in the wiki is stuff about feature X then thats ok but often times they are cross-references to other features or parts of the project. its not possible to merge only certain commits back to
[04:33:47] <Linkandzelda> master, or is it?
[04:35:00] *** Joins: causasui (~causasui@192.241.228.169)
[04:35:17] <rawtaz> Linkandzelda: if you have feature branch X and since you created it and did some changes in X there was also changes made in branch master, then all you need to do to see all that is in master is to rebase the branch X onto master (or you can merge master into X, personally i find that much uglier though, i rebase instead). then X will have whatever is in master as well as your changes in X.
[04:35:40] <rawtaz> the only thing then that you wont see is other branches (unless you also merge those into X, but then it starts becoming messy)

[04:36:03] <rawtaz> that said i still dont really get why you need to do so much branching just for a wiki. what's wrong with someone editing a page and that creating a commit directly on master?

[04:37:37] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: thats what im thinking, to have a constant work tree for master and use that to work with the wiki directly on master and only branch-specific stuff in feature branches to keep it clearer. though the wiki is just a part of the project. the project itself will be what creates the branches and the features
[04:38:13] <rawtaz> regarding that "seeing it all" thing, i think master is the only thing you need to consider being "all", because other feature nbranches that others are working on should not be considered finalized. so all you need to get into "seeing it all" is your feature branch and master.
[04:38:34] <rawtaz> sure. sounds good. should work fine with feature branches, thats what everyone does daily

[04:38:53] <rawtaz> you just need to get into rebasing them on master when you want the stuff in master to be in the feature branch too, it's that simple
[04:38:56] <Linkandzelda> yes thats what i was gonna say. i dont want to see half baked documentation on feature Z in master when thats not even merged into master
[04:39:24] <rawtaz> (or merge, if you prefer that extra cruft in your history - totally pointless in normal settings IMO, can be relevant in certain bigger projects)
[04:39:30] <rawtaz> exactly
[04:41:53] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: ok, i think im not up to speed on the true uses of rebasing. i know it and have done it but i dont do it often enough to say "yea, that will solve the issue"

[04:42:30] <rawtaz> better fiddle with it a bit then, it's really not complicated at all
[04:42:44] <rawtaz> especially if you do interactive rebase, that is the `git rebase -i` command
[04:43:04] <rawtaz> oh wait, never mind that. forget the interactive when it's about rebasing onto master.
[04:43:13] <rawtaz> i mixed things up there
[04:43:57] <rawtaz> but i can tell you that there's very nice explanations with ascii art in `git help rebase`, they really show what to type if you want to e.g. rebase feature X on master, so just look there

[11:55:44] <Samian> Is this a bad commit message? Replace #include "autograd/custom_function.h" which breaks build.
[11:56:32] <Samian> I replaced it with #include <torch/csrc/autograd/custom_function.h>
[11:56:50] <Samian> maybe I should have wrote "Fix bad include bad."
[11:56:57] <Samian> anyone's thoughts?
[11:59:02] <[twisti]> i would have written "Replace incorrect #include "... and left it at that
[11:59:32] <[twisti]> 'fix bad' is generally not very helpful, and 'breaks build' is not relevant information - if the include was wrong, it doesnt really matter where that wrongness was noticed
[12:00:15] <[twisti]> unless the wrong include worked on dev pcs but not in ci or something like that
[12:01:08] <rfuentess> Samian:  you could go with something  like the first suggestion from [twisti]  and then in a new paragraph  explain why it was breaking the build
[12:01:53] <rfuentess> it is up to you. And "learning" to write good commits messages takes time and practice (And it will be suggestive)
[12:02:41] <Samian>  the "breaks build" part is to notify the user that it's not a preferential change, or a preemptive change, but rather a *necessary* change because the last commit does not build
[12:03:31] <Samian> if that's not clear, then I didn't accomplish communicating what I hoped to

[15:54:55] <no_gravity> I often wish a fast forward merge from branch "feature x" would mark each commit that is merged as comming from "feature x".
[15:55:25] <no_gravity> So when you look at your commit history and think "in which context did this change take place" you could see it in a line like "context: feature x".
[15:56:19] <rawtaz> no_gravity: a regular merge would do that, not? (creating a merge commit with that info in it)
[15:56:50] <no_gravity> rawtaz: Yes, but that is much more cumbersome.
[15:57:31] <rawtaz> ok :)
[15:57:33] <selckin> JIRA-3: blabla
[15:57:37] <no_gravity> rawtaz: A commit is like a waypoint to me. Having a waypoint to say "the last 3 waypoints were done in the context of feature x" does not match my mental model at all.

[16:00:22] <no_gravity> rawtaz: If you do "git merge featureX", then context would be set to "featureX" for all commits it merges. Or you can override it with "git merge --context=featureX".

[16:03:48] <rawtaz> a more flexible version of that would be if it wasnt specifically another field named "context", but that git had a feature where on commits you can assign one or more key-value metadata entries. then you could still assign context=foo but you could also use it for other things.
[16:03:53] <rawtaz> and that makes me wonder if git already has that :o

[16:07:00] <rawtaz> thats great. but it doesnt really match no_gravity's use case or what they want. with trailers they have to be added to each commit. no_gravity wants to be able to somehow record a key-value when doing a merge/fast-forward
[16:07:06] <no_gravity> selckin: ?
[16:07:14] <rawtaz> on each affected commit, that is
[16:07:21] <selckin> no_gravity: "13:25:25      no_gravity │ So when you look at your commit history and think "in which context did this change take place" you could see it in a line like "context: feature x"."
[16:07:22] <no_gravity> Yes
[16:07:24] <selckin> it does that
[16:07:36] <selckin> add the metadata in your commit message
[16:07:40] <rawtaz> selckin: yes but then you have to add the trailer to every commit you make on that branch first, right?
[16:07:48] <rawtaz> when you make those commits.
[16:07:57] <no_gravity> selckin: The commit message is manually written at commit time. My model adds the field at merge time.
[16:08:00] <rawtaz> or rewrite the commits before you fast-forward, to THEN add the trailer.
[16:08:02] <selckin> sure, or script it  during the merge, can't invent features that don't exist
[16:08:11] <rawtaz> no, but one can *suggest* one, right?
[16:08:30] <selckin> sure, but i can suggest a way to do it now aswel right?

[18:31:58] <hexology> that is, the "default value" for `--onto` is the same `<old-base>` where the rebase is starting from

[22:30:02] <irc_user> If I think of something small that should have been in the last commit, I usually just do `git commit -m "f"` and then `git rebase -i

[23:01:09] <osse> irc_user: --amend is the right answer, but you might want to use commit --fixup/squash and then rebase -i --autosquash (--autosquash can be enabled by default)

[23:03:10] <irc_user> Oh, amend works great, thanks so much mackerman :)
[23:04:41] <irc_user> osse: What is the main difference between something like `git commit -m "f" && git rebase -i @~~~~~` and fixup+autosquash?
[23:05:52] *** Quits: lgc (~lgc@user/lgc) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2-dev)
[23:06:49] <osse> irc_user: With the latter the todo list is automatically changed
[23:06:49] <irc_user> It looks like all fixup does is name the commit the same name as the specified one with `fixup!` added to it, and then autosquash automatically uses the `fixup` option instead of `pick`?
[23:07:05] <osse> That's basically it
[23:07:47] <osse> And reorders appropriately
[23:08:35] <irc_user> I see. I feel like that would make sense if I could use `@~~`, but the fact that I have to copy the commit hash makes it so much slower :/

[23:10:42] <osse> irc_user: You can use @~~~~
[23:11:07] <osse> I prefer @~4 but you do you
[23:11:38] <irc_user> Oh I meant with the commit, when you specify `--fixup` you have to specify a commit hash.
[23:11:48] <osse> No you don't
[23:11:54] <irc_user> lemme try again -.-
[23:13:01] <irc_user> I was wrong.... thank you...
[23:13:59] <osse> I have a small script that wraps rebase. It basically does GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase -i. It's pretty effective :)
[23:15:28] <imMute> osse: how is that different than leaving off the -i ?
[23:16:17] <irc_user> Oh woah that's awesome, I'll use that too. Thank you for your help :)
[23:16:45] <osse> imMute: Without -i the magic keywords don't work
[23:16:56] <osse> Then it's just a plain rebase
