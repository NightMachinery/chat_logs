[03:36:42] <emg> Emil: can you use bash instead of sh? or does it need to be sh?
[03:36:54] <Emil> no I can use bash
[03:36:54] *** Joins: andril (~andril@072-017-026-115.res.spectrum.com)
[03:37:00] <Emil> doesn't need to be sh
[03:37:40] <Emil> actually sh is there just because some so tutorial used that, of course I'd rather use bash
[03:38:41] <emg> find ... -exec sh -c 'for d do printf %s\\n "[ { systemChat \"%s\"; } ] remoteExec [\"call\", 0];" "$d" > "$d/pathfinder.sqf"; done' find-sh {} +
[03:38:47] <emg> is that what you want?
[03:38:56] <emg> sorry the bash/sh thing ended up being a red herring
[03:39:38] <Emil> what's the find-sh there?
[03:39:41] <emg> alternatively you can do it with a for loop in bash
[03:40:03] <emg> find-sh is the name given to that sh, it's $0 for that script, so if there is an error, it'll print    find-sh: error ....    so it's easy to tell what's erroing
[03:40:08] <emg> you can put anything you want there
[03:40:14] <Emil> ah
[03:40:16] <emg> if you don't want to use find youc an do
[03:40:21] <Emil> lets see if that works
[03:40:24] <emg> shopt -s globstar
[03:40:39] <emg> for d in **/; do printf ... > "$d/..."; done
[03:41:10] <emg> skip find all together and use globstar, ** matches one or more directories, and the trailing / means it only matches directories not other files
[03:41:41] <emg> uh, that being said, I'm assuming from your example that you have a big directory hierarchy with many levels, is that true? or are they all in a single level in a single directory?
[03:42:10] <Emil> that didn't work
[03:42:12] <emg> if it's all within a single directory, a single leve, then it's even simpler and you do    for d in */   and that's the simplest and most portable way
[03:42:33] <Emil> the files have [ { systemChat "%s"; } ] remoteExec ["call", 0];\ntestdir in them
[03:42:40] <Emil> ie the %s wasn't replaced
[03:42:51] <emg> derp, yeah I did a few things wrong there, got confused on %s stuff
[03:43:05] <Emil> emg: yeah there's many directories
[03:43:25] <Emil> there are*
[03:43:45] <emg> find ... -exec sh -c 'for d do printf %s\\n "[ { systemChat \"$d\"; } ] remoteExec [\"call\", 0];" > "$d/pathfinder.sqf"; done' find-sh {} +
[03:47:01] <Emil> that seems to have worked, thank you!
[03:47:29] <emg> you're welcome

[03:52:49] *** Joins: physikoi (~physikoi@user/physikoi)
[03:53:02] <Emil> I kind of do, I'm not 100% percent sure how the file names are passed, does sh with -c execute the first string as command and then pass the remaining arguments (the file names) as stdin?
[03:53:36] <emg> sh -c cmd args...
[03:53:49] <Emil> oh that's interesting
[03:54:02] <emg> find -exec cmd {} +      the + means add as many arguments as you can before hitting max command line length, then run the command
[03:54:03] <Emil> so the file names are passed as arguments to for
[03:54:07] <Emil> yeah I know that
[03:54:32] <emg> so the for loop just means we're running 1 sh for many files instead of 1 sh per file, should be much faster

[03:54:46] <Emil> that's clear no problemos

[03:54:59] <Emil> I just didn't know you could do for without the in 
[03:55:08] <Emil> yeah
[03:56:13] <physikoi> Is there some setting that would silence `printf` and `echo` in a script? I want to have a "quiet" option. One solution is to create a wrapper function to conditionally print/echo. If there's some buitin setting, I'd prefer that. Thanks
[03:57:37] <tirnanog> there is no setting that would specifically affect those two builtins.
[03:57:50] <emg> physikoi: you could coneivably setup a file descriptor to point to either stdout or /dev/null and always redirect to it
[03:57:52] <physikoi> tirnanog: thank you
[03:58:37] <emg> but I think simplest is define your own function to print and check inside that, then there's only one conditional
[03:58:39] <physikoi> emg: perhaps there is a code design pattern, or is that not common with bash? 
[03:58:59] <physikoi> emg: yeah, i think you are right
[03:59:04] <physikoi> thanks

[04:03:08] <physikoi> hm
[04:04:00] <emg> physikoi: there is an unquoted expansion somewhere in your code though
[04:04:05] <emg> I highly recommend using shellcheck
[04:04:10] <emg> !shellcheck > physikoi
[04:04:11] <greybot> physikoi: ShellCheck is a shell linting/suggestion tool. Information and online checker: http://www.shellcheck.net/ . Can also be installed locally as a CLI tool.
[04:04:52] <physikoi> shellcheck is awesome and i do use it. i was just testing tirnanog's snippet from the commandline, not my script.
[04:05:24] <physikoi> maybe something weird going on with PROMPT_COMMAND. gonna try a different environment
[04:07:13] <physikoi> honestly, not sure if it's that, but snippet works elsewheres. anyway, not important. gonna go with wrapper function anyway
[04:07:40] <tirnanog> well, it technically is a wrapper function. I just wouldn't necessarily call it "echo".
[04:08:19] <emg> info() { ((quiet)) || printf %s\\n "$*"; }
[04:08:54] <emg> also let's you have fun with IFS, I've found it useful in the past
[04:09:16] <emg> but most importantly don't have to worry about unexpected echo behavior

[04:10:13] <tirnanog> yes. well, you can just do something similar to that which emg proposed tehen.
[04:11:07] <physikoi> emg: fun with ifs like this? `IFS=$'\v' info ok but what about`

[04:31:18] <cornfeedhobo> if ~/.bashrc has the permissions 005, is there a reason bash would emit permission denied when starting a shell for the user that owns it?
[04:31:58] <tirnanog> yes. what did you expect?
[04:33:03] <cornfeedhobo> tirnanog: i don't know what to expect since i don't know how bash creates the shell. both the possibility of bash setuid -> start shell -> load bashrc and start shell 
[04:33:18] <cornfeedhobo> start shell -> bashrc -> setuid
[04:33:35] <cornfeedhobo> both seemed possible**

[04:33:58] <phy1729> why is setuid entering the picture?
[04:34:00] <tirnanog> you (including an instance of bash spawned in your name) cannot read a file with a mode of 005 unless you are root. it's no more complicated than that.
[04:35:25] <cornfeedhobo> tirnanog: huh. i've never run into this and did not know that. can you elaborate or point me to some documentation on this.
[04:35:56] <phy1729> Well the owner and anyone in the group can't read it
[04:36:02] <cornfeedhobo> phy1729: because i would assume 005 would still allow the owner to read/execute. although, sounds like not?
[04:36:26] <cornfeedhobo> omg. i totally goofed that in my mind when reading it.
[04:36:26] <tirnanog> no.
[04:36:27] <cornfeedhobo> duh
[04:36:32] <phy1729> No if you're the owner, only the first octet applies
[04:36:33] <tirnanog> you don't understand how modes work, it seems.

[18:32:31] <Soliton> sure but that data is not meant for a terminal then anyway.

[21:46:02] <emanuele6> why are you setting i in the loop though?
[21:46:14] <emanuele6> don't you want to set another variable?

[21:46:43] <MaximB> go over the list and sum the numbers
[21:46:47] <emg> MaximB: awk -F, '{s+=$2}END{print s}'
[21:47:04] <emanuele6> if you want to iterate the words in num, use `for i in $num'

[21:48:00] <emanuele6> even if you use $num
[21:48:09] <emanuele6> you are just overriding the iterator 
[21:49:01] <MaximB> emg: thank you the awk magic works

[22:03:30] <geirha> !faq 2
[22:03:30] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/002 -- How can I store the return value and/or output of a command in a variable?
[22:03:35] <geirha> or at least that
[22:03:44] <xx> I'm learning about what I need to quote and what not. Why do I not need to quote that *.pdf in: `for i in *.pdf; do pdfinfo "$i"; done` ?
[22:04:10] <llua> so filename generation happens
[22:04:12] <geirha> because the point of quotes is to inhibit word-splitting and pathname expansion
[22:04:17] <emanuele6> it's not that you don't need, you must not
[22:04:44] <xx> emanuele6: indeed, it doesn't work with "*.pdf". But somehow I'd still expect it to work, but not work with '*.pdf', as the difference between " and '
[22:05:22] <xx> geirha: but isn't filename generation the same thing as pathname expansion?
[22:05:43] <geirha> yes
[22:05:51] <xx> oh wait, I see
[22:06:12] <xx> hmm
[22:06:25] <xx> thank you, it is a bit clearer now
[22:06:27] *** Joins: frm (~frm@user/frm)
[22:06:38] <zeraphel> the thing that had my head spinning in regards to quoting was the fact that you don't need to quote on assignment unless concatenating

[23:02:42] <osse> one proper use of unquoted expansion is ${flag:+--foo --bar 'baz quux'}

[23:09:13] <emanuele6> ah, ok

[23:09:48] <osse> ah
[23:09:54] <osse> I tested with local but didn't get anywhere
[23:10:26] <koala_man> for the time being. dash and busybox ash already don't require it, and the suggestion to not require it in POSIX has been approved but not incorporated
[23:10:38] <emanuele6> i was asking because i also remembered hearing that a=$b$c was problematic and zeraphel had just said "you don't need to quote on assignment unless concatenating"

[23:12:23] <MaximB> Hi, I wrote another 2 functions, the search functions searches for a name in a file, the add function adds an item to the list with supplied amount. this works. however if the item is already found in the list, I want it to only update the sum of the given item.

[23:12:36] <phy1729> koala_man: the austin group is getting prescriptive?

[23:14:04] <koala_man> I don't know how they've been historically
[23:15:13] <emanuele6> MaximB: you are calling a function named "search", but you defined one name "search_func"
[23:15:38] <MaximB> o right...
[23:15:48] <MaximB> but this is only part of the problem
[23:16:00] <MaximB> I'm not sure how to do the adding part
[23:16:02] <emanuele6> indeed
[23:16:06] <emanuele6> !read-r > MaximB 
[23:16:06] <greybot> MaximB: Always use read with the -r option, otherwise backslashes are special. http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/read#read_without_-r
[23:16:25] <emanuele6> ![$? > MaximB 
[23:16:26] <greybot> MaximB: Don't do this: ``mycommand; if [ $? -eq 0 ]'' -- You're running the [ command and checking its exit code to test whether "mycommand"'s exit code is 0. That's a pointless operation, test mycommand directly: ``if mycommand''
[23:16:35] <koala_man> MaximB: instead of trying to figure out how to identify and modify the relevant line, simply delete the line, then add it again

[23:17:09] <MaximB> Ha... interesting idea. out of the box
[23:17:26] <MaximB> but I still would need to add the sum
[23:17:38] <MaximB> the order doesn't matter
