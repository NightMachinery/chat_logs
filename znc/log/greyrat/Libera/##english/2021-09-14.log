[00:29:25] <Voxel> Regarding the punctuation...
[00:29:37] <Voxel> For example, "fr i do fancy me some sleeping pills but pharmacies are closed
[00:29:38] <Voxel> "
[00:29:47] <Voxel> What tf does it even mean
[00:29:57] <huf> that seems fairly clear
[00:30:02] <kurahaupo> In terms of weaponry, a machete approximates a Roman gladius; a short broadsword, typically one cubit long. Except of course it's made of steel rather than bronze, so it will rust but it will keep an edge better
[00:30:05] <huf> they want sleeping pills but cant get any
[00:30:08] <Voxel> huf, how so?
[00:30:13] <huf> Voxel: the words
[00:30:14] <huf> they give a clue
[00:30:16] <huf> fr is "for real"
[00:30:20] <Voxel> Of course, but...
[00:30:33] <huf> the rest is perfectly normal
[00:30:38] <Voxel> The sense is understood, but no the whole meaning
[00:30:46] <huf> that is the whole meaning
[00:30:50] <huf> the rest is flavor
[00:30:53] <kurahaupo> I would never have guessed fr=for real
[00:31:09] <huf> internet.
[00:31:14] <Voxel> For real, I do. Fancy me some sleeping pills, but pharmacies are closed?
[00:31:16] <huf> fr is as clear as af
[00:31:21] <huf> rather, clear af
[00:31:27] <hoglahoo> acaf
[00:31:33] <kurahaupo> I assumed it was a typo for "for" or "from" or "of"
[00:31:34] <Voxel> Lookk...
[00:31:39] <Voxel> There's no issues with freaking abbreviations 
[00:31:50] <Voxel> I'm speaking about f*cking punctiuation
[00:31:58] <huf> I dont think there's anything wrong with "I do fancy me some sleeping pills"
[00:32:12] <huf> doesnt seem to need any punctuation
[00:32:12] <Voxel> tf is is "fancy me some"
[00:32:19] <huf> fany some
[00:32:25] <huf> with a bit of "me" thrown in for flavor
[00:32:27] <kurahaupo> but there are lots of problems with nonfreaking abbreviations
[00:32:37] <Voxel> This flavor is not grammatical.
[00:32:41] <huf> yeah it is
[00:32:45] <huf> it feels fine, so it is fine
[00:32:49] <Voxel> It sounds s*it. Thaat's it.
[00:32:57] <kurahaupo> Voxel: "I fancy (me) some X"  is old;

[01:01:15] <TimMc> I bet "af" is not pronounced as an acronym. It would sound too similar to "ass". (Both would be used as an intensifier, but in grammatically different positions.)
[01:02:08] <huf> I dont think that would stop teenagers
[01:02:33] <huf> the way I remember it, we used the same word for entirely different things in the same contexts :D
[01:02:59] <huf> with words with literally no explanation just appearing
[01:04:46] <huf> but yeah, I think english speakers are in general less likely to pronounce abbreviations as words
[01:05:40] <jessicara> some native english speakers like myself have only heard some online in text, so speak them in own head almost phonetically
[01:05:47] <jessicara> like "lol"
[01:05:48] <huf> like, they'd never pronounce CIA as a word
[01:05:52] <huf> even though it works fine
[01:05:55] <jessicara> yeah
[01:06:06] <jessicara> cia is spelt out/central intelligence agency
[01:06:11] <mdogg> CIA isn't intended to be pronounced as a word.  We pronounce AIDS as a word.
[01:06:16] <huf> you really have to spell FBI and NSA but CIA? 
[01:06:21] <huf> mdogg: sure
[01:06:42] <huf> but I'm saying, hungarians would probably be pronouncing it as a word in the same sort of situation
[01:06:47] <huf> if it's possible, we'll do it
[01:06:50] <huf> if it's not, we'll try
[01:06:57] <huf> and as a last resort, we'll spell it
[01:07:19] <huf> on the other hand, really weird shit like "scuzzy" is an unknown technique for us :)
[01:08:29] <mdogg> As long as it can be understood.  But there are a lot of acronyms that are not intended to be pronounced as a word.  Like "IBM".
[01:08:43] <mdogg> Or "ATM"
[01:08:51] <huf> sure, those dont work
[01:09:00] <huf> was "ISA" pronounced as a word in english?
[01:09:10] <huf> the slot
[01:09:20] <jessicara> i have heard that both ways
[01:09:22] <mdogg> Oh - the 16 or 8 bit slot.
[01:09:22] <mdogg> Yes.
[01:09:29] <huf> hmm.

[01:09:57] <jessicara> jay-peg?
[01:10:18] <huf> and we'll always have gif
[01:11:36] <mdogg> Well, the intent with GIF was that it be pronounced GIF, just like AIDS or SIDAS (in Spanish)
[01:11:56] <huf> yeah, GIF is pronounced with a G as in GIF
[01:11:58] <huf> it's perfect.
[01:11:59] <jessicara> gi or ji though?
[01:12:18] <mdogg> Gi
[01:12:28] <huf> definitely gif here.
[01:12:31] <mdogg> Otherwise you would be pronouncing a brand of peanut butter.
[01:12:38] <huf> nobody would ever intuit anything but a g there
[01:12:51] <jessicara> i keep hearing people pronounce it with j, but pronounce it with g myself

[01:13:12] <huf> but eh, I dont care :D

[01:13:32] <jessicara> that sounds so wrong

[23:18:03] <anikolov> hello anyone knows what's the word for saying i'll do something a bit 
[23:18:12] <anikolov> like a little while
[23:18:53] <anikolov> until I lose interest
[23:19:54] <JustLandedOnMars> I'm at it for a while
[23:20:04] <anikolov> Take a little bite of food is a synonym, as well, I think.
[23:20:49] <anikolov> JustLandedOnMars: I don't think it's that.
[23:21:10] <hoglahoo> there’s a single word that says all of that?
[23:22:19] <JustLandedOnMars> keep on cruising
[23:22:25] <JustLandedOnMars> !ud cruising
[23:22:27] <tinsoldier> Cruising:Aimlessly wandering the streets with the hope of picking up a male for anonymous gay sex <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cruising>
[23:26:07] <anikolov> I don't think it's that - ok maybe "do some work lightly"?
[23:26:43] <anikolov> But like maybe I'm just confused - I had like 10 coffees today and that may affect my brain a little bit.
[23:27:18] <anikolov> And also not only lightly but in between another work that I'm doing as well.
[23:27:40] <anikolov> If such word exists.
[23:28:25] <anikolov> I was thinking also to use (but not the best choice) the word "ping".
[23:30:31] <anikolov> Maybe it's "nip".
[23:31:18] <hoglahoo> Are you talking about finding another word for “bit”?
[23:31:48] <hoglahoo> “I’ll do something for a bit” is common here
[23:32:15] <hoglahoo> “I’ll do something a bit” would sound a little more unusual to me
[23:34:57] <anikolov> No like - "I'll <word> for a little while".
[23:35:55] <hoglahoo> ah
[23:36:15] <hoglahoo> that just depends what you’re doing, doesn’t it
[23:36:47] <hoglahoo> unless you mean “I’ll <word for doing something for a little while>”
[23:37:22] <anikolov> I'll shuffle for a while. But not exactly "shuffle".
[23:39:01] <hoglahoo> a lot of these you’re suggesting mean leave for a while
[23:39:09] <hoglahoo> is that what you’re after?
[23:40:25] <anikolov> I got it now
[23:41:16] <anikolov> I'll pick 'the work' up a bit.
[23:41:21] <hoglahoo> okay, cool.  I need to run for a bit
[23:41:27] <anikolov> bye
[23:41:30] <hoglahoo> ;)
[23:42:29] <lall-> run out for a bit*
[23:42:34] <anikolov> I don't know if it's the right but like in my mind it's the same as saying picking up your nose.
[23:43:14] <anikolov> *right way of saying it
[23:43:30] <hoglahoo> ‘picking your nose’ can be a way of saying you aren’t doing anything important
[23:44:00] <hoglahoo> on a side note, to ‘pick up’ means something different
[23:44:19] <anikolov> Yeah I know 'pick up' means lifting something from the ground.
[23:44:51] <hoglahoo> picking up your nose sounds like something you’d do after being severely injured
[23:45:49] <anikolov> But like for example: "I'll pick it up a bit" - referring to some work to do?
[23:46:15] *** Joins: chenxuezhao (~chenxuezh@120.244.238.69)
[23:47:14] <hoglahoo> Not really, in my opinion.  ‘To pick it up a bit’ means to speed up
[23:47:37] <hoglahoo> If I walk past a subordinate who is working very slowly, I might tell them they need to pick it up a bit
[23:47:51] <anikolov> ok you are right
[23:48:27] <anikolov> And that's not exactly what I said though. I said, word by word: "I'll pick it a bit.".
[23:48:33] <hoglahoo> pick it up has a lot of meanings
[23:48:40] <hoglahoo> <anikolov> But like for example: "I'll pick it up a bit" - referring to some work to do?
[23:48:46] <hoglahoo> I see “up” there ^
[23:48:51] <anikolov> Without the 'up'.
[23:48:59] <hoglahoo> to pick it a bit just means to pick at something
[23:49:14] <hoglahoo> like what I’m doing now, picking at your English
[23:50:37] <anikolov> Maybe you are correct - but what else to put there?
[23:51:16] <anikolov> I know picking up means being ridiculed about something.
[23:51:18] <hoglahoo> I’m still not sure what you’re after
[23:51:32] <anikolov> * I mean picking at
[23:51:57] <hoglahoo> yeah, it can mean that
[23:52:59] <anikolov> Like pick if the work is a heap of something and you are taking small chunks of it.
[23:53:05] <hoglahoo> ah
[23:53:49] <hoglahoo> good question.
[23:54:14] <anikolov> *Laughter* - I thought you got it and was hugely excited for your word.
[23:54:25] <hoglahoo> sorry, haha
[23:55:36] <hoglahoo> I am just thinking my own vocabulary in this case is uninteresting.  I say things like “I’ll try to get some of that knocked out”
[23:56:09] <hoglahoo> or “I’ll work on it a bit” - “work at it” could be used maybe
[23:56:31] <hoglahoo> I’ll shut up now to see if others have something 
[23:57:04] <anikolov> OK thanks.
