[01:37:46] <shimbles> it approaches infinity infinity slowly.
[01:37:51] <rubiksdream> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotomic_polynomial rex
[01:38:02] <rubiksdream> these are the minimal polys for the unit roots
[01:38:15] <shimbles> *infinitely slowly
[01:39:04] <shimbles> so slowly, that you'd have to wait an infinitely long time for the difference to change again; at least an infinitely long time, if not longer.
[01:40:18] <int-e> shimbles: the quotient is about sqrt(2 pi i)^9/sqrt(10), so since you're looking at the logarithm of that, that grows logarithmically in i. But it still approaches infinity.
[01:40:53] <int-e> The proper tool for that analysis is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation

[01:44:26] <shimbles> if it grows to infinity, then isn't the number undefined? (X - Y) / X | X, Y = ∞ = UNDEF

[01:46:04] <int-e> shimbles: it's indeterminate, you actually have to look at the limit instead of the shortcut of plugging in infinities.
[01:46:38] <int-e> shimbles: besides you never say what X and Y are

[01:48:04] <shimbles> it's a "programmers mindset" shortcut; X is the number of digits in the current set being considered (10^10x) and Y is the length of the number of perfectly balanced numbers in that set
[01:48:35] <shimbles> i ultimately did it that way to help python deal with extremely large numbers
[01:49:33] <int-e> shimbles: and why are you looking at (X-Y)/X when the probability you want is given by Y/X?
[01:51:03] <shimbles> right; didn't think that through; the plot is of the difference btw

[01:56:29] <bildramer> why are you still so convinced it's not 0?
[01:58:17] <shimbles> i'm certain it's not 0
[01:58:26] <bildramer> yes, but why?
[01:58:27] <shimbles> all this talk of infinity is remarkably off-the-cuff
[01:59:15] <shimbles> take any random number; on average, that number will be astronomical; and it will have a correspondingly astronomical number of corresponding perfectly balanced numbers
[01:59:38] <riv> haha
[01:59:41] <riv> pick a random number
[02:00:06] <riv> pick a uniform random number from R
[02:00:22] <bildramer> also I did tell you it's just (10!/10^10)^floor(log_10(N)/10) or so
[02:00:28] <int-e> shimbles: No, they will almost all be /somewhat/ imbalanced. The differences in those counts will usually be on the order of sqrt(N), where N is the total number of digits.
[02:00:31] <bildramer> for N digits
[02:01:06] <int-e> shimbles: This can more or less be concluded by looking at the variance of a binomial distribution of p=0.1.
[02:01:28] <shimbles> interesting; if i were to define a metric on a number measuring how balanced it is, would we get normal distributions back?
[02:01:55] <bildramer> if you pick an actual probability distribution for integers (because an uniform one doesn't exist), you might get a nonzero percentage
[02:02:22] <int-e> The numbers with equally distributed digits are the most likely, but their proportion approaches 0 as the number of digits approaches infinity.
[02:02:30] <bildramer> that suggestion (a measure of "how balanced") could also work, maybe

[05:06:19] <newpy> loopspace, I'm having a conceptual difficulty though. When I draw out the tree in my mind
[05:06:40] <newpy> it seems like at the first node (cell) I draw 4 branches b/c I have 4 choices
[05:07:06] <newpy> but at the 2nd level I should only have 3 choices remaining no? Why do I draw 4 branches at each of those 4 2nd-level nodes?
[05:07:22] <newpy> (and then 4 again for the third to get a total of 64 leaf nodes)
[05:08:14] <newpy> oh wait, that's not right, b/c each cell can hold more than one ball
[05:08:49] <newpy> in that case though I'm curious why it's not 3^4 instead of 4^3
[05:09:39] <newpy> ie. each node (ball) has three branches (cells), 4 levels gets you every combination

[08:13:27] <brownorange> what a shame I lost the proof. it was a highly verbal proof
[08:13:39] <Guest5912> I think if you could "smash" or "cut" truth with a tool people invented (proof), then you'd have 2 big chunks of truth, decidable and undecidable truth. the biggest chunk would probably be undecidable still, you'd need different tools/blades to slice it enough to understand, a finer blade than a mere "proof" can provide which is probably a coarser
[08:13:39] <Guest5912> way of slicing truth
[08:14:15] <Guest5912> since you'd have to distill truth into assumptions first
[08:15:45] <Guest5912> not all truth can be distilled into assumptions and even the ones that can may still not be sliced into decidable truth using proofs

[08:22:28] <brownorange> it dealt with the statement which talks about its own provability. if its right about its own provability, then it better be able to prove it, if not then its unprovable, but since only it is its own proof, it can't belong to the formal system. thus when proof=truth, there are no undecidables
[08:23:53] <Guest5912> there's probably truths that can be "cut" by any blade regardless of how coarse it is because the truth is so fundamental and entwined in fabric of our reality that being able to decide it would mean, you could differentiate between extremely broad "truths" that would violate physical laws like uncertainty principle or wave particle duality
[08:24:10] <Guest5912> but I believe there's better tools than proofs that can slice truth into finer grains for sure
[08:25:21] <brownorange> it's funny you mention that Guest5912. I've recently decided classical proofs, meaning proofs from axioms to show some conclusion can be reached, is really the weakest form of proof you can imagine
[08:25:57] <Guest5912> brownorange what's strongest form of proof?
[08:26:51] <Galois> that's kind of the entire point. If a proof still holds under the weakest form of proof imaginable, then that proof must really be incontrovertible.
[08:27:42] <Galois> conversely, if you have some "proof" which is valid under some forms of proof but invalid under other forms of proof, then it's not a watertight proof.
[08:27:58] <brownorange> i don't know about strongest. but a stronger one is one where proof has reusability and helps us more
[08:28:08] <brownorange> i'm thinking computationally for example
[08:28:33] <Galois> well, now you're just wrong -- there are many classical proofs which are invalid computationally.
[08:28:52] <Galois> therefore computational proofs are weaker than classical proofs, contradicting your claim that classical proofs are the weakest form of proof.
[08:29:19] <Guest5912> Galois do you think there's stronger proofs than classical maths proofs? where strongest in this sense means produces more incontrovertible truths?
[08:29:30] <Guest5912> I mean *weakest
[08:29:33] *** Quits: cjb (~cjb@user/cjb) ()
[08:29:56] <brownorange> Galois I mean when parts of the proof are accessible to computation.
[08:30:11] <Galois> intuitionistic proofs are clearly weaker than classical proofs, because every intuitionistically true result is classically true, but the reverse is not true (unless math is inconsistent)
[08:30:38] <Galois> I know what a computational proof means. Coq naturally gives you computational proofs unless you declare extra axioms.
[08:31:05] <Galois> in fact, you can even automatically extract a program from such a proof.
[08:31:54] <Guest5912> imagine the types of maths that would hold if we only had computational (strong) assumptions
[08:32:17] <Guest5912> or stronger proof system
[08:32:18] <torus> Galois, how did you learn sao many maths?
[08:32:54] <brownorange> Galois I have to insist tautologically in cases where you can extract actual computations as part of the proof, it's always better than a mere proof.
[08:33:21] <Guest5912> maybe Riemann hypothesis is a truth that is computational in nature rather than (weaker) maths
[08:33:33] <Galois> I'm not going to dispute that (even though it is in principle disputable). What I dispute is your claim that computational proofs are "weaker" than classical proofs. They're stronger.
[08:34:09] <brownorange> by weak and strong did you mean opinionated?
[08:34:27] <Galois> never mind. I'll just state what I mean instead of using your terms.
[08:34:40] <Galois> Every computational proof is classically valid, but the reverse is not true.

[08:40:00] <Guest5912> if the method of proof we agree on is weaker, then perhaps by making it a tiny bit stronger more 'truths' could be smash out/decided upon but they'd be no less 'truth' than the ones smashed out by the weaker proof system, although perhaps less 'universal' in the most absurd use of the term
[08:40:40] <Guest5912> as long as the strength of the proof system remains above some threshold it would still produce all truths

[08:46:58] <brownorange> I think a mere proof + a select set of juicy examples that intuitively lead to the conclusion, is always 'infinitely' useful. in other words the informal sketch that informs a mathematical result has a lot of power that the formal just does not.
[08:51:08] <Guest5912> brownorange I agree. I think maths has to go through a revolution where it naturally weeds out its 'Einsteins' that aren't creating value and are instead producing abstract nonsense and then find a formal way to weed that out maybe by using stronger axiom of choice. only way well ever advance to level of proving things that are useful for humanity

[09:10:07] <Galois> Coq lets you automatically generate programs that implement your proofs. You can run these programs on arbitrary inputs as long as they satisfy the requirements of the statement being proved.
[09:10:12] <torus> Woolfram is a bag of air
[09:10:39] <Galois> Coq does not automatically generate random inputs for you according to a probability distribution (for starters, what distribution???), but you can do so yourself if you wish.
[09:11:11] <Galois> and, of course, since the proofs are checked to be valid, the program will function as proven on all inputs.
[09:11:17] <torus> Talk about a guy who created a bunch of interesting stuff without creating any new meaning or knowledge (Wolfram)
[09:11:48] <Guest5912> Galois imagine if I could prove P=NP in a 500 line maths proof but lines 24-27 required ability to 'substitute' formal maths with a 'stronger' computational 'proof' that was universally agreed upon among computer scientists?
[09:11:57] <Guest5912> but not formally proven by maths
[09:12:18] <Guest5912> shouldn't that qualify as a formal proof?
[09:12:34] <Galois> a formal proof is one that validates in Coq (or Lean, or Isabelle, or _something_). Full stop.
[09:12:34] <Guest5912> shouldn't I get credit and the million dollar prize for this
[09:13:15] <brownorange> Classical proofs want to lock-down horizontal transfer of results to/from other proofs unless they are the conclusion or given hypotheses, this so people don't pollute proofs with results that may not actually stem from the hypotheses.
[09:13:24] <Guest5912> Mr Galois tear down these walls
[09:13:38] <Galois> I don't think your proposal qualifies as a formal proof, since you didn't mention your supposed proof validating in anything.

[17:32:25] <[itchyjunk]> e and log undo each other right?
[17:32:45] <[itchyjunk]> but the ln log thing there is confusing me
[17:33:33] <quarterback> I am confused about log and exponent.
[17:33:55] <quarterback> ln is log to the base e
[17:34:10] <Z-module> in many contexts, "log" is that same thing
[17:34:22] <Z-module> but yes, ln is always that
[17:34:30] <quarterback> log may mean log to the base 10
[17:35:11] <Z-module> yes, e^(ln(t)) = t  for all t > 0, and  ln(e^t) = t  for all t
[17:35:45] <quarterback> This is what I wanted to know.This came in a derivation.
[17:36:36] <quarterback> There are two alternative solutions though to a problem.
[17:36:51] <Z-module> by the way, if H is n x n,  det(-H) = (-1)^n det(H)
[17:37:22] <quarterback> Show that e ^ (-lnx) = 1/x ( not -x).
[17:37:33] <quarterback> I got both answers by using different substitutions.
[17:37:39] <tolarz> exp(-ln(x)) = exp(ln(x^(-1)) = x^(-1)
[17:38:05] <quarterback> only one has to be correct if it is for a physical quantity
[17:38:20] <tolarz> exp(-ln(x)) = 1/exp(ln(x)) = 1/x
[17:38:23] <Z-module> or instead:  e^(-r) = 1/e^r, so  e^(-ln(x)) = 1/e^(ln(x)) = 1/x
[17:42:27] <Z-module> this reminds me of the niceness of  f(x) = ln(1 + e^x)   as an example.

[19:19:59] <rubiksdream> basically, if a function is sufficiently nice at some point, i.e. it satisfies the dini condition at that point (google dini condition), its fourier series will converge at that point to the average of its left/right hand limits

[19:22:01] <rubiksdream> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dini_criterion greenbagels
[19:22:10] <rubiksdream> probably a fourier one
[19:22:21] <rubiksdream> i learned this in a course literally called 'fourier analysis and theory of distributions'
[19:22:23] <rubiksdream> so :/
[19:22:43] <rubiksdream> well you would learn about the dini criterion in a fourier one
[19:22:51] <rubiksdream> but just knowing about how fourier series tend to converge to this average
[19:22:55] <rubiksdream> i think is taught in calc 2 or 3 in the US
[19:23:41] <rubiksdream> see here https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/de/convergencefourierseries.aspx
[19:23:47] <greenbagels> oh weird i dont remember the average one
[19:24:02] <rubiksdream> the section 'convergence of fourier series' says the fourier series converges to the average of the two one sided-limits given it is sufficiently nice
[19:24:20] <rubiksdream> the condition they give for 'sufficiently nice' is piecewise smooth
[19:24:26] <rubiksdream> but thats much stronger than you need
[19:24:33] <rubiksdream> the dini criterion is in some sense the weakest possible condition
[19:26:40] <rubiksdream> an easier one to remember, is if the function has a well defined left hand and right hand derivative at a point, its fourier series will converge at that point
[19:26:47] <rubiksdream> and thats still weaker than piecewise smooth
[19:27:03] <rubiksdream> (converge to the average value, ofc)

[19:51:20] <qed-office> how was the seminar rubiksdream?
[19:53:56] <rubiksdream> qed-office it was interesting! although I didnt internalize the specifics of the proof, the main result was kinda neat: first of all there are translation invariant probability measures on the space of entire functions with borel sigma algebra generated by the semi-norm ||F|| = sup_{K compact} M_{F}(K), translation inv. i.e. lambda(set + c) = lambda (set) (where we translate a set of functions by composing them with a translation), and
[19:53:56] <rubiksdream> lambda is non-trivial (nonzero)
[19:54:51] <rubiksdream> second of all, for any such measure lambda, for lambda-almost all entire functions F, and any epsilon > 0, we have lim_{R -> infinity} log(log(M_{F}(D_R(0)))/ log^{2-epsilon}(R) = infinity
[19:55:03] <rubiksdream> i.e. 'most' entire functions under these measures grow super fast
[19:55:39] <rubiksdream> but we also have lim_{R -> infinity} log(log(M_{F}(D_R(0))) / log^{2+epsilon}(R) = 0 for any epsilon > 0
[19:56:35] <rubiksdream> so we grow faster than exp(exp(log^{2-epsilon}(R))) but no faster than exp(exp(log^{2+epsilon}(R))) for any epsilon > 0
