[00:00:12] <da_wunder> imho, that pattern doesn't work with php and imho using those are making your code to harder to understand
[00:00:45] <da_wunder> olle: ngrx - https://ngrx.io/
[00:00:55] <olle> Pipe in OCaml is very long-hanging fruit:
[00:00:56] <olle> `let (|>) v f = f v`
[00:00:58] <olle> That's it
[00:01:04] <olle> Slightly harder to shoehorn it into PHP ^^
[00:01:39] <olle> da_wunder: Angular?
[00:01:59] <da_wunder> eg. https://ngrx.io/guide/effects#handling-errors isn't so easy to read for most of people
[00:02:30] <da_wunder> and that is really simple example
[00:03:04] <olle> https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pipe-and-compose-in-javascript-5b04004ac937/
[00:03:11] <olle> Better use-case here
[00:03:47] <olle> It gets a bit abstract, yes.
[00:04:47] <olle> Related topic: Was there ever a discussion about getting rid of "Use of undefined constant" in cases like `array_map(strlen, $strings)`?
[00:04:47] <da_wunder> I'm just fine with those pipes - but really I have seen multiple other developers to see those not so clear - that is my point
[00:05:27] <olle> da_wunder: It's good for getting rid of multiple layers of indentation, I think. But yes, you have to learn to read it.
[00:05:31] <__adrian> olle: making function names first-class would not be a trivial change
[00:05:40] <__adrian> could potentially break tons of code.
[00:05:57] <olle> __adrian: middle-ground: make the warning shut up?
[00:06:05] <__adrian> def not
[00:06:10] <__adrian> imo the warning should be fatal
[00:06:18] <olle> I thought about (callable) type-case: `array_map((callable) strlen, $strings)`
[00:06:35] <olle> or maybe even `(fn)` as a cast... :d
[00:07:12] <__adrian> (callable) strlen  seems like a lot more work (and less clear) than just  "strlen"
[00:07:34] <olle> I disagree. "strlen" looks like a typo from the point of view of "communicate intent".
[00:08:46] <da_wunder> imho not - use cases like that are special ones and if you're not using ' or " to escape that then it's _constant_ and functions !== constants
[00:09:22] <olle> da_wunder: Honestly, I think it could be considered an idiosyncrancy of PHP here.
[00:09:36] <__adrian> why do you think that?
[00:10:13] <__adrian> functions are not "things" (types). they're named chunks of code. and the names are strings.
[00:10:16] <olle> Because lots of languages allow passing functions like that... Or wait. Do they? At least JS, OCaml, Haskell.
[00:10:41] <__adrian> strlen()  ← the "strlen" part here is literally a string, exactly like "strlen". just php knows how to parse it in that context.

[00:11:23] <__adrian> lots of languages are different, yes
[00:11:52] <__adrian> but like i said, you can't "pass functions." functions aren't first class. you pass function _names_.
[00:11:54] <olle> ;)
[00:12:19] <olle> Just trying to figure out what's easiest: Adding partial applications, or fixing that warning.
[00:12:24] <__adrian> suddenly making functions first class would be problematic, as they would suddenly conflict with any number of constants that people have defined
[00:12:45] <__adrian> the warning is not "broken" so fixing it is def. not the easier path.
[00:12:47] <olle> Sure. That's why I was thinking of the type case.
[00:13:25] <__adrian> (fn)strlen  ...might be workable
[00:13:30] <olle> define('strlen', fn($x) => strlen($x))...?
[00:13:33] <__adrian> but still not convinced of the benefit
[00:14:14] <__adrian> actually,  Fn::strlen
[00:14:24] <da_wunder> imho - that would just confuse devs more
[00:14:40] <__adrian> Fn:: as a pseudo-static-class that contains all global function names
[00:14:54] <AllenJB> Pretty sure internals has considered all of this at some point of other recently - read through the partial function application, pipes and first class callables threads
[00:14:55] <olle> Fn could be a class implementing __call() to cast it?
[00:15:06] <AllenJB> (all of them!)
[00:15:12] <__adrian> i don't like userland magic
[00:15:20] <__adrian> but could be done that way
[00:15:20] <da_wunder> ^
[00:15:42] <olle> AllenJB: Yeah, guess I should search through externals.
[00:16:20] <__adrian> it would just be  class Fn { public static strlen = "strlen"; . . . }
[00:16:22] <da_wunder> and really does that `define('strlen', fn($x) => strlen($x))` provide you the autocomplete on your IDE?
[00:16:42] <olle> da_wunder: That's not even legal - constants can't be callables D:
[00:16:47] <__adrian> er const
[00:17:35] <__adrian> constants can be callable, who said they couldn't?
[00:17:52] <olle> "Constants may only evaluate to scalar values, arrays or resources"
[00:17:55] <olle> php 7.4
[00:18:19] <__adrian> two of those types can be callable
[00:18:52] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/l5qt1
[00:19:06] <__adrian> (can't use "Fn" though.)
[00:19:32] <olle> o.o
[00:20:01] <__adrian> like i said, functions aren't "real things." you call functions by their names. and those names are strings.
[00:20:27] <olle> Ah, __get() doesn't intercept class constants
[00:20:44] <__adrian> right, it wouldn't
[00:20:45] <da_wunder> and I must ask - why do you want to use constant there?
[00:20:53] <__adrian> he doesn't like the "quotes"
[00:21:13] <__adrian> so it's not specifically that he wants a const, he wants first-class function( name)s
[00:21:17] <da_wunder> not his/hers words - yours one - so olle explain that
[00:21:26] <olle> Well, the current suggestion on the table is array_map(strlen(?), $strings)
[00:21:36] <__adrian> ?
[00:21:41] <__adrian> the () invoke it
[00:21:45] <__adrian> not what you'd want
[00:21:54] <olle> No, the '?' is the partial application RFC
[00:21:58] <__adrian> oh
[00:22:02] <__adrian> meh
[00:22:08] <olle> It wraps it in a lambda
[00:22:25] <__adrian> essentially  Closure::fromCallable("strlen");  ?
[00:22:47] <olle> I prefer strlen as is, if possible. But, someone explained to me it might be hard, because of the collision and ambiguity, as you also point out here.
[00:23:19] <olle> __adrian: Well, you can also put '?' as second or third argument. Or any argument.
[00:23:24] <olle> In the RFC
[00:23:25] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d471c8.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[00:23:54] <olle> They even added ...? for variadics
[00:24:04] <__adrian> is partial application actually what you're looking for? i did not get that impression
[00:24:27] <olle> But I agree, I don't like userland magic either. pipe() however could be idiomatic, if that warning could be dealt with.
[00:24:41] <olle> __adrian: No, the end-goal is the pipe operator + partial application.
[00:24:45] <olle> For Larry, I mean.
[00:24:47] <__adrian> did you ever see the original pipe rfc?
[00:24:56] <olle> By Sara? Yes, it's linked.
[00:24:59] <olle> They use $$
[00:25:04] <__adrian> yep
[00:25:47] <da_wunder> just a friendly remimder - why the hell do you want to make things so hard and complicated? use simple solutions that other devs can easily to understand...
[00:26:15] <olle> da_wunder: I don't care _that_ much - I don't think I ever used pipe when coding in OCaml. I try to avoid partial application too.
[00:26:30] <olle> But sometimes it's handy, when nesting function calls.
[00:26:59] <olle> foo(bar(baz($something)));
[00:27:10] <olle> --> $something |> baz |> bar |> foo
[00:27:16] <olle> or pipe($something, baz, bar, foo)
[00:27:30] <olle> You read it in order of execution.
[00:27:42] <da_wunder> and still using pipe is just ok with me - no problem there - but when you start to define those functions to constants - for no really reason - imho - I see that you're hitting the wall

[00:49:41] <olle> OK, so functions are not case sensitive
[00:49:47] <olle> If they were, it'd be another discussion

[00:55:01] <olle> __adrian: Yes, but I'm considering the risk of collision between function name and constant.
[00:55:07] <olle> Constants are always UPPER_CASE
[00:55:11] <__adrian> no
[00:55:15] <olle> no?
[00:55:20] <__adrian> of course not
[00:55:24] <Sammitch> that's just convention
[00:55:26] <olle> By convention, they are.
[00:55:26] <__adrian> const foo = "foo!";  // works fine
[00:55:46] <olle> Who does that?
[00:55:54] <__adrian> it's not even enough to be "a convention," imo. just common practice/style
[00:56:01] <Sammitch> anyone that feels like it
[00:56:23] <da_wunder> hmm, "I'm considering the risk of collision between function name and constant" - why? if there is collision there is a clear error about that - right?
[00:56:29] <__adrian> "considering the risk of collision between function name and constant"  there's zero risk.
[00:56:30] <Sammitch> is there a difference between "convention" and "something most people usually do"?
[00:56:48] <__adrian> unless you mean you want to just throw constants out there and pretend they're function names.

[01:02:33] <Sammitch> liberal use of the @operator, WCGW
[01:02:49] <__adrian> what if I wrote  array_map(strlen, ["a", "ab", "abc"]);

[02:37:07] <sumthing1980> hi
[02:37:18] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  just avoid using the same variable / parameter name for different things
[02:40:55] <BadAdviceCat> sumthing1980, I've used https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 to learn how to use git's version control. (The PDF is good)
[02:41:19] <BadAdviceCat> Hello there, Azrael_-
[02:41:31] <sumthing1980> ok thanks
[02:41:53] <Azrael_-> is there a way to send whatsapp messages using php for free?
[02:42:41] <Blondie101010> PHP doesn't decide what Watsapp allows for free
[02:43:07] <Azrael_-> i know, until now i only found paid options and looking for other possibilities
[02:43:47] <Blondie101010> if you had to pay for them, then they likely make sure you can't bypass them...  therefore, if you find a way, it's probably against their T&C

[02:44:47] <Azrael_-> yes, but e.g. for sms i know an option to run a client program on a mobile phone to avoid paid sms gateways
[02:46:27] <sumthing1980> if my vars are sent in POST, like POST(usr) does setcookie(usr) overwrite that??
[02:47:22] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  no, but again don't
[02:47:57] <sumthing1980> I have some buffer caching so setcookie does work but I wrote vardump(usr) first in index.php
[02:48:21] <Blondie101010> `usr` is not a variable name in PHP
[02:48:23] <sumthing1980> but when I have my authentication function that reads usr and pass variables, disabled, things work
[02:48:58] <sumthing1980> $_POST['usr']
[02:49:08] <sumthing1980> from my form
[02:49:12] <Blondie101010> is it set to what you expect?
[02:49:29] <Blondie101010> it should be if the form was POSTed
[02:50:05] <sumthing1980> I have vardump for post at the beginning, then authentication function, which may or may not alter or delete my post vars somehow,
[02:50:26] <sumthing1980> when I disable the authentication function things work and vardump shows correct html form data
[02:50:54] <sumthing1980> but when I enable it, vardump for post shows empty
[02:51:03] <sumthing1980> but they are before the authentication func
[02:51:11] <sumthing1980> some weird shit
[02:51:24] <sumthing1980> it has buffering but still it should show the vardump post before it is altered
[02:51:26] <Blondie101010> so you need to read the code that changes it and fix it
[02:51:50] <sumthing1980> var dump works retroactively? perhaps
[02:52:00] <Blondie101010> note that it may be intentional for security concerns
[02:52:11] <sumthing1980> it shows content of post when the buffer outputs everything
[02:52:17] <Blondie101010> you should ask the person who wrote the auth funciton
[02:52:22] <sumthing1980> not when it is actually run
[02:52:28] <sumthing1980> it is me :)
[02:52:43] <sumthing1980> anyway it works if I change the html var names
[02:54:12] <Blondie101010> so you use conflicting names, as I pointed out > 30 minutes ago
[02:54:14] <Blondie101010> stop doing that
[02:54:35] <Blondie101010> it's confusing you MUCH more than it can confuse the PHP engine which does linear processing
[02:55:10] <sumthing1980> you mean cookie/get/post using the same variable names?
[02:55:30] <Blondie101010> yes, those don't create real problems if you know how the engine will interpret them
[02:55:53] <Blondie101010> but it's definitely something to avoid which causes confusion for nothing

[17:19:57] <olle> Looks like partial funcion application will just barely fail. Pity, lots of work done.

[17:20:36] <biberu> oh, there was an rfc for that?
[17:21:44] <AllenJB> A failed RFC vote does not necessarily mean "never" - it means "not this specific implementation". I think it's highly likely it'll come back later in a revised form
[17:22:30] <biberu> olle: this one: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/partial_function_application ?

[17:28:24] <AllenJB> But it's highly unlikely any existing votes are going to change. The only realistic chance for this RFC to pass in this vote is more voters
[17:28:36] <olle> That's true
[17:28:41] <olle> How many have voting rights...?
[17:29:33] <biberu> hm, is there an actual need for the placeholders? normally i'd just arrange the arguments in the order they should be applied, i.e. the thing you know at the latest point furthest to the right, or worst case, make a small wrapper, it feels smelly to need those too often
[17:30:25] <AllenJB> Quite a few (pretty much anyone who's ever had a php.net VCS account I believe, plus some others), but many are inactive (the exact criteria for who can get voting rights is also a tad on the vague side and while it's changed over time I don't believe anyone has ever had their voting rights revoked)
[17:31:17] <olle> biberu: Depends on how you ask, but array_map, array_walk etc can have inconsistent places for haystack and needle
[17:31:21] <olle> who you ask*
[17:34:57] <olle> So you either need to be able to move '?' around, or accept boilerplate fn($x) => array_walk('needle', $x) to fix it
[17:35:17] <olle> AllenJB: Hm, what's VCS?
[17:35:56] <olle> Nik said he'd move the first-class callable syntax to vote if PFA fails.
[17:36:03] <AllenJB> version control system - cvs / svn / git
[17:36:12] <olle> Which is $foo = foo(...) <--- creates callable
[17:36:18] <olle> AllenJB: Oh, ok
[17:38:22] <biberu> olle: yeah, the boilerplate is my usual solution, but in that case i think it'd be fn ($xs) => array_walk($xs, fn ($x, $k) => ...)
[17:38:54] <olle> biberu: When piping you could remove one of those fn, I think. Depending on what you're piping on, of course.
[17:38:59] <biberu> olle: array_walk is probably a good example of the argument order too, it's probably more common to know the callback before the values
[17:40:05] <olle> biberu: I mean, it's the opposite of array_map
[17:40:07] <olle> Pretty random
[17:40:54] <biberu> the order for array_map feels better to me
[17:41:01] <olle> No opinion xD
[17:41:28] <olle> But that's the reason why '?' exists instead of just |> str_split |> array_walk
[17:41:34] <olle> that and pesky constants.

[17:42:05] <biberu> many of the examples in that pr take a lot of arguments too
[17:42:13] <biberu> rfc*
[17:42:28] <olle> foo(?, ?, ?, ?, ?) :)
[17:42:34] <olle> ?????
[17:44:01] <biberu> yeah, i find it pretty uncommon to need 5 arguments *and* that those couldn't either be grouped up in e.g. a record or the function split into smaller parts
[17:44:39] <olle> Not to mention he uses function names as "stuff" and "things", lol
[17:44:41] <biberu> if i design a function that takes 5 arguments and i need to partially apply the third one, then perhaps i should suffer some boilerplate ;)
[17:44:46] <olle> Use real-world examples, bitte...
[17:45:18] <biberu> i don't really have an opinion about the placeholders though, i just find them curious
[17:45:47] <olle> afaik, piping in functional programming has non of that
[17:46:49] <biberu> well, while you can partially apply functions for a pipeline you don't have to use both ideas together either
[17:46:59] <olle> No
[17:47:18] <olle> However, according to Larry, people complained about callable syntax when he discussed the pipe rfc
[17:47:36] <olle> You just can't make people happy sometimes :)
[17:48:06] <biberu> such is life
[17:48:40] <olle> I'd suggest they have a better pre-process to figure out if it's at all worth to start coding.

[21:44:20] <AllenJB> Also there's a relatively long list of internally defined classes that extend Iterator (particularly in SPL, but probably other places too)

[22:18:53] <__adrian> key() can return anything
[22:23:52] <ash_worksi> oh
[22:24:27] <ash_worksi> is there a general programming word that encompasses the concept of SplObjectStorage ?
[22:24:43] <__adrian> "map"
[22:26:08] <ash_worksi> __adrian: this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(computer_science)
[22:26:17] <ash_worksi> (note: it redirects to assoc array)
[22:26:31] <__adrian> yeah. only real difference between splobjectstorage and an (assoc) array is that splos allows+enforces object keys
[22:26:47] <ash_worksi> splos = spls?
[22:26:52] <__adrian> SplObjectStorage
[22:26:56] <ash_worksi> oh
[22:27:57] <ash_worksi> hmm, well that makes my query a bit harder; I am trying to find some splos use cases
[22:28:22] <__adrian> "i have random information that i want to associate with this object"
[22:28:41] <ash_worksi> yeah, a use case would make that a bit clearer
[22:29:13] <__adrian> it's there, but tbh, when i used it was usually to just keep a (unique) set of objects
[22:29:30] <ash_worksi> that's a good use case, imo

[22:50:56] <ash_worksi> I am pleasantly surprised that mixed is treated like a parent interface to everything else. That is, you can make return types more specific or argument types more generic despite the explicit typing on interfaces
[22:51:06] <ash_worksi> or maybe it shouldn't be pleasant
[22:52:04] <__adrian> that's Liskov Substitution Principle (covariance/contravariance)
[22:52:49] <__adrian> child classes can make args less specific, and returns more specific. this is because doing so doesn't break the parent contract.
[22:53:35] <ash_worksi> I understand that; I am just surprised I guess mixed is treated that way.
[22:54:06] <ash_worksi> I guess it is just special like that. I mean there are no other native types that have native subtypes, right?
[22:54:20] <ash_worksi> unless an array is actually a type of object
[22:54:31] <__adrian> ah... you mean "mixed" as a literal typehint
[22:54:47] <__adrian> mixed as a literal typehint is idiotic
[22:55:10] <__adrian> but meh, yes. it's more of "not specified" than "parent type"
