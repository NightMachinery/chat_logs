[00:00:02] <jotham> that's the ancient way
[00:00:27] <jotham> MaNI is gay in the ancient way too
[00:00:30] <T`aZ> what is the cool way you are talking about
[00:00:47] <jotham> people being able to love whomever they please without harming anyone, T`aZ 
[00:01:09] <T`aZ> ha, ok
[00:01:56] <T`aZ> as it fucking should be since the begging of time (and it was, in fact)
[00:02:09] <jotham> to be fair, they will harm the one they love, badly, ultimately
[00:02:15] <xuxx> Guys, I'm interested into high performance computing using C++. Do you think that there are jobs in that field?
[00:02:16] <jotham> so it's a bit of a fantasy
[00:02:23] <jotham> no xuxx 
[00:02:31] <jotham> all the wallstreet bots use java
[00:02:31] <xuxx> Or should I focus on something else if I want to make a good career
[00:02:48] <xuxx> jotham: so what can I do using C++
[00:02:49] <T`aZ> career, what is that word you are talking about
[00:02:58] <xuxx> huh
[00:03:04] <T`aZ> xuxx: you first need to study
[00:03:06] <jotham> xuxx: maintain old programs that are maddeningly fucked by NIH
[00:03:11] <xuxx> T`aZ: I got my degree
[00:03:17] <xuxx> And land my first job as a C++ dev
[00:03:22] <T`aZ> then pick whatever sounds technical
[00:03:30] <T`aZ> sounds like a good first step
[00:03:32] <xuxx> This job is shit
[00:03:36] <T`aZ> lol
[00:03:39] <jotham> welcome to your career
[00:03:40] <xuxx> I have to add feature to an old program
[00:03:41] <jotham> they are all shit
[00:03:43] <xuxx> 1990 made
[00:03:45] <jotham> right
[00:03:48] <jotham> xuxx: maintain old programs that are maddeningly fucked by NIH
[00:03:49] <xuxx> mixed with fortran
[00:03:51] <jotham> that's your job now
[00:03:53] <jotham> forever
[00:03:55] <T`aZ> you probably jhave no idea what shit means in the professional world, but, maybe you are right
[00:03:56] <jotham> gratz
[00:03:58] <xuxx> fuck that
[00:04:10] <T`aZ> lol
[00:04:11] <xuxx> I want to learn on the side
[00:04:14] <xuxx> to get a better job
[00:04:16] <T`aZ> let me repeat this
[00:04:25] <jotham> you could go into gamedev and get fucked by crunch and shitty culture
[00:04:25] <xuxx> Don't break my dreams 
[00:04:28] <T`aZ> 21:33 <T`aZ> you probably jhave no idea what shit means in the professional world
[00:04:34] <xuxx> I don't want gamedev
[00:05:01] <jotham> i'm in accord with T`aZ 
[00:05:05] <jotham> it's gonna get way shitter
[00:05:05] <xuxx> so
[00:05:11] <xuxx> I should leave c++
[00:05:13] <T`aZ> you think youll start designing a complete framework when you are a junior ?
[00:05:19] <T`aZ> youll do the crap things nobody wants to do
[00:05:22] <xuxx> T`aZ: no
[00:05:24] <xuxx> I know
[00:05:28] <xuxx> But that's not the point
[00:05:48] <xuxx> I want to know what are the fields where C++ is usually used
[00:05:58] <xuxx> So I can prepare on my free time
[00:06:00] <T`aZ> a milions of the√π
[00:06:04] <T`aZ> no
[00:06:08] <T`aZ> you need to learn experiences
[00:06:17] <xuxx> with my job?
[00:06:27] <T`aZ> fixing bugs, in crappy code os actually really rewarding
[00:06:32] <T`aZ> boring, yes
[00:06:39] <xuxx> yeah I will
[00:06:47] <xuxx> its shitty af im telling u
[00:06:52] <T`aZ> ok
[00:06:58] <T`aZ> one, last fucking time
[00:07:02] <T`aZ> 21:34 <T`aZ> 21:33 <T`aZ> you probably jhave no idea what shit means in the professional world
[00:07:13] <xuxx> huh
[00:07:29] <T`aZ> this is how you progress, you start in a puddle of crap
[00:07:37] <T`aZ> and you try to keep it afloat
[00:07:48] <T`aZ> the after some months, improvements are expected
[00:08:03] <T`aZ> then, maybe, MAYBE, some of your ideas will be listened to
[00:08:04] <jotham> Faux: you need to council xuxx 
[00:08:11] <jotham> Faux: he thinks programming is gonna get better
[00:08:13] <jotham> hehe
[00:08:19] <T`aZ> 'hey, what about upgrading to a C79 compiler?'
[00:08:23] <T`aZ> C89*
[00:08:32] <xuxx> I use visual studio 6 at my job
[00:08:36] <Faux> Nah, gonna use my new spell, "transform to time-telling whale".
[00:08:41] <jotham> haha
[00:08:55] <T`aZ> then, if confidence is acheved, progress is made
[00:08:55] <xuxx> I think I'm already at a low point
[00:09:06] <T`aZ> been there done that
[00:09:19] <T`aZ> it's bad, but not that bad, there are worse, way way worse
[00:09:22] <xuxx> 1990 project, C++/C#/Fortran, programming using Notepad++/Visual Studio 6.0
[00:09:28] <Faux> I rejected a job 'cos it was vs6 in .. 2009?
[00:09:38] <Faux> Maybe it was 2008.
[00:09:45] <xuxx> Why did I accepted this job
[00:09:47] <xuxx> .....................
[00:10:00] <T`aZ> are you in a fucking bank or some crappy sector like that ?
[00:10:09] <xuxx> T`aZ: no
[00:10:12] <xuxx> but yes
[00:10:17] <T`aZ> then, it's not that bad, trust me
[00:10:24] <xuxx> I was in a bank field
[00:10:25] <T`aZ> stay there for 2 years, then change
[00:10:27] <xuxx> I left after 2 months
[00:10:30] <xuxx> XD
[00:10:38] <T`aZ> lol, that is understandable
[00:10:42] <xuxx> And now I'm there
[00:10:45] <T`aZ> (again, been there done that)
[00:10:49] <xuxx> Still shitty but better than before
[00:10:54] <T`aZ> see
[00:11:29] <jotham> xuxx: you just have to get a few 2 year stints on your cv, like T`aZ says
[00:11:29] <xuxx> I want to learn as more as a I can
[00:11:35] <jotham> then you'll come across as a 'senior'
[00:11:38] <jotham> even though you fucking wont be
[00:11:39] <xuxx> jotham: 2 years huh
[00:11:44] <jotham> 2 years each job
[00:11:45] <xuxx> I plan to leave in 6 months lol
[00:11:49] <jotham> or you look like a fucking idiot
[00:11:52] <T`aZ> xuxx: loearning how to refactor is a skill
[00:12:06] <T`aZ> learning ot recognize bad code is also a skill
[00:12:18] <T`aZ> and, just because it's old, doesnt mean its bad
[00:12:28] <xuxx> jotham: wdym?
[00:12:37] <jotham> i've hired a lot of people over the years
[00:12:49] <jotham> and a resume/cv with jobs less than a year or two look bad
[00:12:52] <jotham> like you aren't reliable
[00:12:56] <jotham> and a waste of time
[00:13:35] <T`aZ> xuxx: a job is'nt always 100% pleasure, it's work, stuff needs to be done, with given constaints
[00:13:43] <T`aZ> some are acceptable more than other, ofc
[00:13:48] <xuxx> T`aZ: I know
[00:13:51] <T`aZ> constraints*
[00:13:53] <xuxx> I will do the job
[00:13:58] <xuxx> But I don't plan to stay 2 years
[00:14:02] <T`aZ> do
[00:14:08] <xuxx> No
[00:14:13] <xuxx> I plan to move oversea
[00:14:16] <xuxx> At the end of the year
[00:14:21] <T`aZ> managing on old can lead to progress and using newer stuff
[00:14:32] <xuxx> T`aZ: yes that's what I want to do
[00:14:37] <xuxx> Upgrade the projects
[00:14:38] <T`aZ> but it's not given for free, and not in 2 weeks
[00:14:42] <xuxx> So it will be easier for others
[00:14:42] <jotham> as i get older i way prefer fixing bugs in other peoples bullshit than writing my own bullshit
[00:14:51] <jotham> producing new software is an active form of harm on the planet
[00:14:56] <T`aZ> xuxx: you need more experience to do that though
[00:15:04] <xuxx> T`aZ: I know how to do that
[00:15:15] <T`aZ> xuxx: moving C89 deo to C++17 is not THAT easy, at all
[00:15:21] <T`aZ> you ll break your teeth
[00:15:25] <T`aZ> you need experience
[00:15:33] <T`aZ> you have to opportunity to get such experience, do it
[00:15:45] <xuxx> If I finish what I need to do
[00:15:49] <xuxx> I will propose to do that
[00:17:50] <xuxx> I will do this job like a boss
[00:17:58] <T`aZ> the skill is when you are ameable to manage the amount of crap in other peaople code, and still make the prod, your collegues/your boss happy
[00:18:22] <T`aZ> saying 'it's old crap, lets rewrite everything' is not good
[00:18:37] <xuxx> Not the plan
[00:18:41] <T`aZ> and *there* is the skill
[00:18:52] <xuxx> The code is good
[00:18:54] <jotham> this billing system i am in charge of has so many bugs in it
[00:18:59] <xuxx> It's just the environnement that is shitty
[00:19:05] <xuxx> It takes 45 mintues to compile
[00:19:09] <T`aZ> in my experiance, everything is shitty
[00:19:09] <jotham> whenever i try to fix one i write like a dozen little side test cases pulling in various bits of the codebase
[00:19:17] <xuxx> I can't check errors without compiling
[00:19:17] <T`aZ> management, code, environement
[00:19:22] <jotham> and it can take days before i dare edit the production source
[00:19:34] <xuxx> vs 6.0 is slow af
[00:19:38] <xuxx> I need to be in a win7 vm
[00:19:41] <xuxx> etc ...
[00:19:41] <T`aZ> xuxx: you need to take advantages of thoses issues
[00:19:53] <xuxx> T`aZ: But the code is well structured
[00:20:25] <T`aZ> (as is, you want to improve thing kinda goal, not drink more coffed because its compiling)
[00:20:32] <T`aZ> coffee*
[00:20:43] <xuxx> yeah
[00:20:52] <xuxx> when it's compiling I'm still working
[00:21:02] <xuxx> then commiting and fix bugs
[00:21:10] <T`aZ> see, jotham is already an expert, thinking about automatic test cases to avoid regressions etc
[00:21:19] <xuxx> yes I want to add that
[00:21:29] <xuxx> I want to add CI
[00:21:45] <T`aZ> one thing at a time
[00:21:46] <xuxx> when I finish the stuff I will ask to update the project the right way

[11:51:55] <Carbonflux> heh ya, i have never been able to figure it either, its being going on for many years now.
[11:52:35] <Carbonflux> i guess sometimes people just don't like one, some kind of hidden "chemistry."
[12:01:15] <Renderwww> one day  "daily reminder" will evolve into the next good morning
[12:01:51] <Renderwww> and aeons from now ethymologists will have congresses about how that came to be
[12:02:10] <jotham> T`aZ: lied about ukranians wearing mask, sucked putins cock, etc
[12:02:17] <jotham> general shitcockery
[12:02:25] <jotham> american political psychodrama stuff
[12:02:32] <jotham> also, morning
[12:02:38] <jotham> monday sucked, sorry to inform you all
[12:03:09] <ERROH> bummer
[12:09:33] <Carbonflux> actually ERROH has been saying nasty things to me for years, this Putin trolling is just the latest example. I suspect he is one of those people who is polite to others IRL but mean to certain people on net. He seems to have some kind of check list to decide who.
[12:10:47] <T`aZ> but monday just started

[12:24:57] <T`aZ> this is so far away i dont know if they are in the future or past
[12:27:06] <ERROH> actually carbonflux (intentonally lowercase) has been saying stupid things for years, the latest stuff is just something that triggered me out
[12:27:53] <ERROH> it used to be just dumb depack chopra sciencesy stuff that's somewhat harmful if it is spreading (and it is)
[12:30:02] <ERROH> covertly trying to kill people with covid and putler's dick is different stuff
[12:31:26] <Renderwww> https://nitter.net/elonmusk/ when will he lose his twitter loicense?
[12:33:21] <Carbonflux> lol
[12:33:25] <Carbonflux> is he wrong?
[12:33:53] <Carbonflux> or Amazon might make it
[12:35:16] <Carbonflux> the conjunction of identity politics, corporate marketing and social engineering is profound.
[12:35:44] <Carbonflux> making us all into profiles that can be cut and pasted.
[12:36:27] <Carbonflux> ERROH's above reaction to me is a more primitive example of this kind of neo-tribalism
[12:38:55] <Carbonflux> also, to openly suggest that freedom of thought is harmful to others is exactly what Putin and all other dictators agree upon, and that is much more primitive than medical fascism.
[12:39:57] <Carbonflux> we are facing a serious wave of mind control right now and its the "smart" people that are mostly the victims of it.
[12:40:29] <Carbonflux> Turning Science into a religion, that you "Believe" in being only one example
[12:44:47] <Carbonflux> Elon Musk actually sees it, its interesting watching him try to restrain himself, he has a lot to lose
[12:45:08] <Renderwww> when do we get tech-priests? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyK7lX4sk0c
[12:45:56] <Carbonflux> we have them now, they are called Experts.
[12:47:04] <Carbonflux> i never played Warhammer.
[12:53:47] <MaNI> covertly trying to kill people with covid seems a tad on the overdramatic side
[12:56:55] <Carbonflux> we live in dramatic times. 
[12:59:42] <Carbonflux> its just a domination tactic, i doubt he has really thought about it, its just keywords setting him off.
[13:01:11] <ent58> The rhetoric that science has turned into religion is just anti-intellectualism if you mean it the way I see it plastered around in the states
[13:02:14] <ent58> It is still the case that real experts have a better understanding of certain subjects than laypeople, and every society that relies on those experts to form policy wins
[13:02:26] <Carbonflux> there are two kinds of science now, the process of investigation and the institution of established facts that constitutes a reality model. For most people the latter is what them mean when they say "Science."
[13:02:45] <MaNI> its possible for both things to be true, not everything is a binary
[13:02:58] <MaNI> I think thats a lot of the issue at the moment that everyone sees everything as binary
[13:03:06] <Carbonflux> ya, if its not falsifiable its not science.
[13:03:12] <Renderwww> most policy decisions can't be decided by soyence, they are mostly moral decisions
[13:03:57] <ent58> I object to the idea that moral decisions can't, with some basic philosophical underpinnings, be quantified objectively by scientific process
[13:04:18] <Carbonflux> the problem is that the aspect of science that has taken the role of the normalized reality model has taken on many attributes that were once the practice of the church.
[13:05:09] <Carbonflux> sure, assume that those that are in the expert class are totally ethical and without bias, which is impossible in practice.
[13:05:33] <ent58> So, what kinds of decisions
[13:05:35] <ent58> qualify
[13:05:48] <ent58> as part of a "normalized reality model"
[13:05:59] <MaNI> its also somewhat naive to expect that the people running society listen to the experts, so much as they listen to them when convenient and silence them when not, i.e. weaponise them
[13:06:23] <Carbonflux> the very reason we are having a trust break down right now is because of the exploitations of expert culture by different interests.
[13:06:56] <MaNI> we see that here in za where in the height of covid government was "listening" to the "experts" but as time has gone on they increasingly actually silence the experts to keep justifying rules that the "experts" no longer agree are necessary
[13:07:18] <Carbonflux> well at good example is "Science" claiming something does not exist or is wrong, Science can only describe what is. 
[13:07:41] <Carbonflux> to say something is "Not science" and therefore not "real" is corruption of science.
[13:08:02] <ent58> Is that not just a shorthand for saying "you haven't met the burden of proof?
[13:08:03] <ent58> "
[13:08:25] <Carbonflux> no
[13:08:36] <ent58> Alright, if I said astrology is "not science"
[13:08:48] <ent58> that's pretty clear, right?
[13:09:26] <Carbonflux> science is a method of investigation, so thats a good example of the problem
[13:09:41] <Carbonflux> you can't say astrology is not science
[13:09:54] *** Joins: aeplus (~steve@2603-8000-cf42-7ec1-162f-1996-0ae2-d7da.res6.spectrum.com)
[13:09:59] <Carbonflux> you can investigate astrology using science
[13:10:21] <Carbonflux> its like saying a rock is not science.
[13:10:53] <ent58> Science is not a general term for method of investigation, it's a particular philosophy, and the shorthand there is "astrology does not follow the scientific method"
[13:11:21] <ent58> I agree you definitely can investigate it with science
[13:11:26] <Carbonflux> the problem is when science crosses over into a reality model, then it fills the slot religion used to.
[13:11:35] <MaNI> you can say that astrology is not a science because none of the theories that make up its field hold up to the scientific method under scrutiny
[13:11:53] <Carbonflux> but thats not correct is it?
[13:12:00] <ent58> I think it is
[13:12:16] <Carbonflux> if you had a computer that modeled every atom in the universe than astrology would be correct
[13:12:22] <ent58> "science" is not a term that can be rigged to mean any method of investigation
[13:12:26] <MaNI> however theres a lot of other things people consider science that are also iffy (if not quite as iffy as astrology) in that regard
[13:12:33] <MaNI> a lot of psychology for instance
[13:12:57] <Renderwww> yeah, how is your replication study going Mr. Psychologist
[13:13:02] <Carbonflux> anyway, my definition of bias in science is too strict for most people.
[13:13:11] <MaNI> and certainly some of the covid modelling ;) 
[13:13:26] <Carbonflux> i see science as being quite corrupt at this point.
[13:13:41] <ent58> I just fail to see how aligning your understanding of the world to a generality of interpretations of research becomes religion
[13:13:41] <Carbonflux> most of what people call science is actually opinion and commentary
[13:13:48] <Carbonflux> such as the comments about astrology
[13:14:00] <Renderwww> it's almost like fields where we can't run reproducible experiments where pretty much every variable is fixed don't produce the greatest results
[13:14:06] <MaNI> see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis
[13:14:35] <MaNI> I mean carbonflux is not entirely wrong in thie regard, over the last decades problems have emerged
[13:14:50] <Carbonflux> because the body of "knowledge" that is the result of the interpretation of investigations by the scientific process has become canonical.
[13:15:18] <Renderwww> psychology always was rather shady from my non expert understanding
[13:15:43] <Carbonflux> its just not complete, like astrology is not complete.
[13:15:46] *** Joins: aleios (~aleios@user/aleios)
[13:15:47] <MaNI> which is not to say that science as a whole is not great and isn't an improvement over no science, however hes not wrong that it can become like a church and that people should be wary of that
[13:16:18] <Renderwww> science does a pretty good job in the long run, short term it's rather noisy
[13:16:23] <Carbonflux> also there is a frame of reference problem with regard to astrology.
[13:16:23] <ent58> "pure" discovery by replicating every possible experiment and verifying every research paper you ever use to build your understanding of the world is not a practical solution, but if you're just talking about the replication crisis, I get that
[13:16:26] <MaNI> and that it can and has been corrupted to varying degrees, anything can be, nothing is immune to this
[13:16:49] <MaNI> and rejecting the idea that it can be corrupted and putting forward that it should just be trusted, well thats exactly how that type of corruption becomes common
[13:16:49] <Carbonflux> yes, but most people forget that science is an approximation
[13:17:19] <ent58> it is corrupted by people screwing with it, not by the process
[13:17:22] <Carbonflux> they take it literally as absolute fact
[13:17:27] <Carbonflux> yes
[13:17:28] <MaNI> I think for the record hes a bit extreme and has crazy theories on most things, but that doesn't mean there isn't some truth to what he says
[13:17:33] <ent58> That would be a flaw in their reasoning
[13:17:38] <MaNI> s/bit extreme/super extreme
[13:17:57] <Carbonflux> but thats what happened with religion to, people started screwing with it and it became corrupt.
[13:18:07] <Carbonflux> the same pattern is happening with science now.
[13:18:09] <ent58> that's..
[13:18:15] <ent58> the two are not even remotely comparable
[13:18:20] <Renderwww> science doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's embedded in a society that forces some structure and institutions on it, which always have been prone to corruption
[13:18:28] <Carbonflux> in your opinion ;)
[13:18:44] <ent58> It's not an opinion
[13:18:45] <MaNI> religion is dogma, dogma "a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true."
[13:18:55] <MaNI> its not hard to see how science can become dogma and ergo a religion really
[13:19:19] <ent58> science can become dogma if you *attach* religion to science, it can't do so on its own
[13:19:30] <ent58> and you can see the glaring flaw right away
[13:19:47] <MaNI> of course it can, the second you accept it as incontrovertibly true
[13:20:06] <MaNI> as many did and have done with some of the early covid scientific advice for instance
[13:20:44] *** Quits: aleios (~aleios@user/aleios) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[13:21:39] <ent58> accepting it as incontrovertibly true is a flaw in and of itself
[13:22:19] <ERROH> hey putinholster, me telling you you suck cock does not infrigde on your rights to be dumb
[13:22:25] <MaNI> yes, which comes back to what Renderwww just said
[13:22:32] <Carbonflux> as soon as you speak in absolutes its a dogma, you just did it yourself ent58 by saying, it's not an opinion, its a habit everyone is takes for granted.
[13:22:47] <ent58> But, on average, a population glued to the opinions of experts in their field vastly outperforms any alternative
[13:22:59] <Carbonflux> that not exactly true
[13:23:31] <ent58> If you meant that corruptive influence apply to both religion and science, I get that
[13:23:33] <Carbonflux> even going back to 1907 there have been experiments with crowds
[13:24:01] <Carbonflux> a lot of times experts are wrong
[13:24:01] <ent58> Consider what the alternative to that is
[13:24:18] <dukwon> is dogma like smegma?
[13:24:25] <Carbonflux> the point is to move forward, not back
[13:24:29] <ent58> Yes, experts can be wrong, the real question is by what degree
[13:24:42] <Carbonflux> we need to be aware of the corrupt and work on mindfulness.
[13:25:37] <dukwon> and ineptitude
[13:25:46] <ent58> I suspect you don't actually disagree with a lot of what I'm trying to say, but the way you're trying to put science in the sky-daddy shoebox reminds me of apologist tactics
[13:26:00] <ent58> and it's this rhetoric that exactly leads to what you appear to not want
[13:26:15] <dukwon> people don't necessarily have careers in science (or academia in general) because they're the best at their job
[13:26:17] <ent58> which is the rejection of scientific expertise in favor of....? What exactly
[13:26:53] <dukwon> the ones with the best programming/inference/whatever skills get poached by industry for much larger salaries and job security
[13:26:58] <Carbonflux> there is a huge crisis in expert culture right now, a break down in trust that is causing a lot of conflict in society and the main response from the scientific community and the expert culture is to call people stupid or uneducated for asking basic questions.
[13:27:10] <Carbonflux> that is what the church did for 100s of years.
[13:27:56] <ent58> "I'm just asking basic questions" is usually code for "I didn't ask any questions, and I'm going to shotgun you until you have to pause to answer, and then say ah ha! Gotcha!"
[13:28:10] <Carbonflux> thats also the same argument that church made, "what would you replace us with?" 
[13:28:18] <ent58> They are responding to a real problem with education
[13:28:20] <Carbonflux> they would demonize any other option
[13:28:24] <ent58> probably not the right way
[13:28:48] <Carbonflux> this is not about replacement, its about learning how to think.
[13:29:00] <Renderwww> dukwon confirmed not to be the best at his job
[13:29:11] <dukwon> absolutely
[13:29:21] <dukwon> otherwise i'd be making 3x as much with way less stress
[13:29:29] <dukwon> might even have a wife by now
[13:29:29] <Renderwww> meanwhile I'm a highly paid, competent industry wage slave
[13:29:31] <ent58> The bar to replace the scientific method with a better method is an extremely high bar
[13:29:39] <ent58> You would need to use it to vet its replacement
[13:30:16] <MaNI> how wrong can experts be? well see the wildly wrong early ferguson covid modelling that threw the whole world into hysteria
[13:30:28] <Carbonflux> the scientific method does not need to be replaced, we need to return to it.
[13:31:02] <ent58> cool
[13:31:09] <Renderwww> https://hugelolcdn.com/i/704266.jpg meme for the discussion
[13:31:26] <MaNI> governments listening to experts is good but theres a lot of nuance/complication in which experts and how those experts are selected and whether they are listened too only when convenient or all the time, and what the repercussions are if the experts give terrible advice and so on
[13:31:42] <MaNI> in the time of kinds bad experts got fed to the lions, but alas I doubt ferguson will ;) 
[13:31:46] <MaNI> *kings
[13:32:01] <ent58> Yeah, that's kind of its own subproblem: how to be a good expert
[13:32:25] <ent58> but the alternative to "listening to experts" is listening to joe-random
[13:32:33] <ent58> or what is effectively joe-random
[13:32:45] <ent58> I guess that's my disconnect with what carbonflux is saying
[13:32:54] <Renderwww> even if you are the best expert in your field your advice can be shit because you have no clue what other unintended consequences your advice might have
[13:33:09] <dukwon> you might not even understand the advice
[13:33:09] <ent58> I know what you mean
[13:33:44] <ent58> Oppenheimer, etc
[13:33:55] <dukwon> there could be an implied knowledge of statistical inference, which can be very counter-intuitive
[13:34:19] <MaNI> I think the middle ground that some of us are gunning for is "listen to experts, but not secretly in private, in public, and force them to have their advice held up to public scrutiny, even if that scruitiny may come from annoying joe random"
[13:34:36] <ent58> then being a good communicator and throttling back your language to be precise is part of the job of being an expert, which is a problem
[13:35:07] <MaNI> we have gone a bit much into "make decisions in private and then claim the experts condoned it" side of things
[13:35:24] <ent58> MaNI: what happens when joe random is 60% of the population and your school systems start removing your information from the textbooks because jesus looks down on gays
[13:35:28] <Carbonflux> this is the problem with the "other people are stupid" narrative. 
[13:35:44] <Carbonflux> who is this "joe random" you are talking about?
[13:35:53] <ent58> In america it's pretty obvious
[13:35:53] <MaNI> yeah society is difficult for sure
[13:35:59] <Carbonflux> is it?
[13:36:02] <dukwon> the guy with the tiger?
[13:36:02] <ent58> It can be
[13:36:07] <ent58> LOL
[13:36:09] <ent58> yes.
[13:36:15] <Carbonflux> in your opinion :)
[13:36:24] <Carbonflux> its a frame of reference problem
[13:36:28] <ent58> if everything is an opinion, nothing is
[13:36:57] <Carbonflux> and a lack of mental discipline
[13:38:00] <ent58> If you push the bar of what an expert is expected to do to a height only attainable by minmaxers
[13:38:07] <ent58> you're going to have a bad time
[13:38:45] <Carbonflux> no, its just lazy thinking, you don't want to take the time to understand different frames of reference you don't see as successful. 
[13:39:18] <ent58> Any frame of reference that invokes a deity to explain anything about the world is something I don't have to waste energy on
[13:39:28] <ent58> that doesn't mean their conclusion is wrong
[13:39:30] <ent58> that's a fallacy fallay
[13:39:34] <ent58> that's a fallacy fallacy
[13:39:39] <Carbonflux> we have gotten into the habit of thinking that success in our own frame of reference is a metric of absolute truth.
[13:40:03] <ent58> who is "we"
[13:40:12] <ent58> I'm sure it exists
[13:40:26] <Carbonflux> the intelligencia
[13:40:52] <ent58> I really want to examine an example of this
[13:41:28] <ent58> Do you happen to have an example of something like this?
[13:42:07] *** Quits: night_wulfe (~wulfe@cpe-174-103-156-213.cinci.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:42:38] <Carbonflux> of what?
[13:42:57] *** Joins: night_wulfe (~wulfe@cpe-174-103-156-213.cinci.res.rr.com)
[13:43:15] <ent58> Of something people believe because a group of experts claim it's that way that isn't backed by research
[13:45:41] <Carbonflux> the gravitational constant.
[13:46:30] <ent58> *spits drink*
[13:46:32] <ent58> continue
[13:47:06] <Carbonflux> heh
[13:47:07] <ent58> Like I want to understand where you're coming from
[13:47:09] <MaNI> how about when theres two groups of experts, both differing, but one of the groups is amplified by those in power via media the angry mobs and other mechanisms, and the other is silenced through various censorship angry mobs calling for them to be fired and so on
[13:47:20] <MaNI> because thats a more accurate model of whats gone on with covid
[13:47:30] <Renderwww> wasn't there that thing with "masks don't help" then it was mask mandates and then it's masks help, but only if it's good ones?
[13:48:04] <Carbonflux> the problem we are facing as a civilization is who defines what valid research is, most of all when it applies to complex systems. 
[13:48:51] <MaNI> in this case carbonflux is basically been claimed to have wanted to murder people with covid because he decided the smaller group were right, granted he may be a bit extreme in his views in that regard and/or may even have backed the right group but for the wrong reasons
[13:49:03] <MaNI> but thats basically the situation from my viewpoint
[13:50:05] <ERROH> putinholster has always been careful to never openly call for murder
[13:50:11] <MaNI> Renderwww, I think there was a "we knew they would help but lied because we wanted them for medical staff" step somewhere in the mess as well
[13:50:15] <ERROH> so i understand why you may not agree with my hate
[13:50:28] <Renderwww> MaNI: great way to bolster trust in experts I must say
[13:50:34] <Renderwww> they probably listened to PR experts
[13:50:36] <MaNI> indeed
[13:51:49] <Carbonflux> i have not backed any group, the problem is that people don't parse what each other are saying and skim for keywords. 
[13:52:17] <Carbonflux> even asking basic questions about Covid means you are anti-vax.
[13:52:26] <Carbonflux> its nuts.
[13:52:33] <MaNI> well backed is maybe the wrong word, your viewpoints have been more aligned with that group is maybe a more accurate but less concise way of saying it?
[13:53:09] <ent58> I know there's a contingent of people who have no problems with covid for some sick reasons: anybody that thinks masks don't work or doesn't get vaccinated is at a greater risk of dying, so they just shrug their shoulders and go "oh well"
[13:53:23] <Carbonflux> mostly i have been attacked for reflecting on the symbolism of stuff, nothing related to actual policy.
[13:53:25] <Renderwww> but what if it's good for the herd to kill off all the weak with covid?
[13:53:57] <ent58> human societies don't have to operate in that fashion
[13:55:43] <MaNI> we also don't have to operate in the fashion where for months I am banned from going outside even though outside would be a massive beach on which I usually walk my dog without even seeing other people nevermind infecting them
[13:55:45] <MaNI> and yet...
[13:56:17] <Carbonflux> a good example is in the US right now the Sackler trial is going on, and that is just one example of big pharma flat out murdering people for profit.
[13:56:33] <MaNI> but most of the popular discourse is just "either you are completely for everything or you are an anti vaxxer that wants my grandma to die"
[13:56:44] <Carbonflux> and people wonder why there is no trust in vaccines among a lot of people.
[13:56:47] <MaNI> flux is not wrong about that, that is the sad reality of what the last few years have been
[13:57:52] <ent58> anyone with a basic understanding of how vaccines work and very basic stats on their efficacy cannot be against vaccines without being a grifter
[13:57:57] <ent58> that is, if they are not grifting
[13:58:00] <ent58> they don't understand them
[13:58:27] <ent58> they can be against mandatory vaccination, but they cannot say they do not work
[13:58:43] <ent58> and I believe you underestimate how many grifters there are
[13:59:00] <MaNI> well they can certainly say they are not as effective as was advertised, but again thats nuance, which the world no longer seems to do
[13:59:28] <ent58> super nuance
[13:59:40] <ent58> amplified to create genuinely toxic doubt
[14:00:56] <ent58> Before the fiasco with the MMR vaccine out of the UK
[14:01:01] <Carbonflux> i think mRNA is going to turn out to be a huge scandal when people realize that the pharma corps know it would wear off unlike traditional vaccines.
[14:01:31] <ent58> carbonflux: source?
[14:01:34] <Carbonflux> its a classic subscription scam, saving a failed technology
[14:01:46] <Carbonflux> the source is my own thoughts.
[14:02:01] <ent58> then from the same place you claimed that from
[14:02:16] <ent58> I'm going to say that the evidence shows that mRNA is a tactical godsend
[14:02:31] <ent58> and allows rapid response where classical vaccines cannot compete
[14:03:15] <ent58> It could turn out that you are correct, and I understand the cynical capitalistic angle you're coming from
[14:03:32] <ent58> but this is an example of the type of "just asking questions" I'm talking about
[14:05:43] <Carbonflux> think of it like a programmer, mRNA is not properly formatted for the immune system, it is an internally cellular communication protocol. The immune system is expecting a complete sample of the virus. This is why the immune system does not store the information and people need endless booster shots until they are exposed to the actual virus.
[14:06:19] <Carbonflux> as far as the tactical argument, the Oxford vaccine was ready in time, cheap to make, easy to store and transport
[14:06:23] <ent58> mRNA is formatted to create the parts of the coronavirus that T-cells can in fact build immunity to
[14:06:29] <Carbonflux> its still not approved in the us
[14:06:53] <ent58> So your belief that it's a ploy to sell more vaccines
[14:06:54] <MaNI> mRNA may be a tactical godsend but in this case the disease mutating into something much more effective but way less deadly seems to actually be whats ending things, or basically its just run its course, vaccines probably saved some lives but I don't think they have been in this instance the massive win they were made out to be
[14:07:29] <MaNI> and forcefully deploying them has come at a q uite steep price in terms of putting mistrust in the minds of a not insgnificantly large portion of the population
[14:07:35] <ent58> They weren't, but you bet your ass there would be *zero* vaccine hesitancy if this was airborne ebola
[14:07:47] <ent58> it wasn't deadly enough to make people rational
[14:07:56] <ent58> but just deadly enough to wipe out 6 million people
[14:08:03] <ent58> (I can't remember the total number)
[14:08:18] <Carbonflux> thats the fear narrative the health care industry uses to great effect.
[14:08:27] <MaNI> 6 million is probably a bit overblown given that many of those people would have died over the course of 2 years anyway, pandemic or not
[14:09:12] <Carbonflux> a lot of people died because they were giving them antibiotics in the hospital.
[14:09:23] <ent58> Yeah...so
[14:09:24] <ent58> the US
[14:09:28] <ent58> is a major chunk of that number
[14:09:45] <ent58> extremely unproportionate to the total
[14:09:46] <MaNI> and even if not during those 2 years certainly over the next 10 years
[14:09:51] <ERROH> > the source is my own thoughts.
[14:09:55] <ERROH> that's all you need to know
[14:09:59] <ent58> and one of the major factors of that
[14:10:05] <MaNI> so if we wait 10 years and average things out we may find the excess deaths to be almost negligble 
[14:10:12] <MaNI> something to think about
[14:10:16] <ent58> is our failure to rollout vaccines, and our failure to mask and spread out properly
[14:10:58] <ent58> you spread out any amount of deaths over any arbitrary stretch of time and of course you can make it look insignificant
[14:11:07] <MaNI> not true
[14:11:23] <ent58> You're basically saying 6 million deaths is "meh"
[14:11:30] <MaNI> nope not at all
[14:11:30] <ent58> I know that, for example
[14:11:37] <ent58> vehicular deaths
[14:11:40] <ent58> are way, way higher
[14:11:43] <ent58> and a real issue
[14:11:48] <ent58> but it's just
[14:11:58] <MaNI> what I'm saying is that it glosses over the nuance that many of those deaths were people toward the end of their lifespan and who would have died over the next 10 years anyway
[14:12:15] <ent58> and those 10 possible years were cut short by a disease
[14:12:29] <T`aZ> ho shit what have i done
[14:12:33] <ERROH> but he could've walked his dog otherwise
[14:12:38] <ERROH> will you think of the dog
[14:12:40] <ent58> this doesn't even get into the problem of long covid
[14:12:41] <MaNI> and may very well have been cut short by a different disease
[14:12:48] <MaNI> 10 years is a generous upper bound for many of the lives
[14:12:48] <ent58> and the effects on out nervous systems it's going to have
[14:12:53] <MaNI> many of them would have died in the same year
[14:12:55] <ent58> our*
[14:13:07] <MaNI> I'm saying thats its important to keep in mind this context
[14:13:30] <ent58> There's very real research that demonstrates elements of covid that persist for a very long time (without vaccination)
[14:13:40] <MaNI> its quite different from having 6  million people who otherwise were very unlikely to die being wiped out, whether that makes you uncomfortable or not
[14:14:24] <MaNI> "ERROH> but he could've walked his dog otherwise" - and see this is exactly the sort of shitty rhetoric when viewpoints are challenged, can't engage the actual facts so make some derp comment about me only caring about my dog instead
[14:14:35] <MaNI> now THAT is exactly whats wrong with the world
[14:14:52] <ERROH> but you are
[14:14:53] <Renderwww> daily reminder: MaNI is a dog walker!
[14:15:09] <ERROH> i didn't see any other valuable contribution about it
[14:15:20] <ERROH> other than being a putinholster enabler
[14:15:45] <dukwon> is that one of those lifts that doesn't have doors?
[14:15:46] <ERROH> you were inconvenienced by masks and whatever your corrupt gov came up with
[14:15:58] <ERROH> and your solution is: we should've let the old people die
[14:16:18] <MaNI> must be great when your entire life consists of such oversimplifications
[14:16:35] <ERROH> i didn't care for 2 years
[14:16:41] <Renderwww> he was inconveniend by something akin to curfew, which is a rather drastic step to be taken
[14:16:47] <ERROH> i started caring when i saw pics from hospitals being bombed
[14:17:04] *** Quits: ent58 (~ent58@rrcs-97-76-214-244.se.biz.rr.com) (Quit: Client closed)
[14:17:05] <ERROH> and seeing that antivax bunch are suddenlty the same group as putin apologists
[14:17:11] <MaNI> maybe I didn't like our military beating poor people to death
[14:17:19] <MaNI> for instance
[14:17:29] <ERROH> i don't care about your country, sorry
[14:17:32] <ERROH> or your dog
[14:17:36] <MaNI> or logic
[14:17:37] <Carbonflux> this idea that "if you don't agree with me people will die" is a classic form of blackmail used by authoritarians for centuries. And just another example of how medical fascism is a real thing.
[14:17:41] <Renderwww> how else would you solve the problem with poor people?
[14:17:47] <MaNI> but hey, hurr durr emotionalr eaction
[14:18:07] <dukwon> Renderwww, make them not poor any more... or make them not people any more
[14:18:08] <ERROH> i'm not data from tng i don't care about your logic
[14:18:21] <ERROH> i see crisis actor and hate him
[14:18:31] <ERROH> i see crisis actor enabler, hate for him too
[14:18:33] <MaNI> like a cave man with a club yeah
[14:18:58] <ERROH> caveman and their enablers bomb hospitals
[14:19:34] <MaNI> I mean you realise I'm completely anti russian invasion right? oh no of coruse not because your cave brain can't even seperate a discussion about covid from one about russia
[14:19:40] <MaNI> *course
[14:19:48] <Carbonflux> actually in this case you are the crisis actor ERROH.
[14:20:09] <Carbonflux> you are supporting the arguments that validate management by crisis
[14:20:16] <ERROH> i don't care about you mini
[14:20:27] <ERROH> i care about enabling the number one scum in this channel
[14:20:30] <MaNI> saying that flux is partially right (possibly for the wrong reasons) about one thing must mean I absolutely agree with him on everything else he ever says
[14:21:01] <T`aZ> we need a /boo irc command
[14:21:08] <Carbonflux> thats just a tactic. 
[14:21:33] <ERROH> you were probably in the same line as those who admired hitler for being vegetarian
[14:21:38] <Carbonflux> lumping people into ground, putting words in their mouths
[14:21:44] <dukwon> boourns
[14:21:52] <Carbonflux> its a domination tactic
[14:22:20] <Carbonflux> anyway, i assume there is a Greek word for it.
[14:22:45] <Carbonflux> the Greeks were really good and quantifying debate tactics.
[14:22:46] <ERROH> domincation tactic is what putler is doing to you when he asks you to wear his favourite gown
[14:22:46] <MaNI> if I had to pick the person in this channel who is right now acting the most like a hitler enabler I'd say its actually you ERROH
[14:23:03] <MaNI> buit of course you don't care
[14:23:15] <ERROH> i'm hurt now
[14:23:39] <Carbonflux> ya, ERROH is the best candidate for being a KGB agent
[14:25:40] <Carbonflux> tho to be honest, i doubt any intellegence community would waste time on this group of basically powerless people with very little  social media presence.
[14:26:00] <Carbonflux> does anyone here even post on social media?
[14:26:09] <T`aZ> does irc count ?
[14:26:16] <Carbonflux> thats a good question
[14:26:39] <Carbonflux> i don't have a facebook or twitter account, i am basically invisible.
[14:27:09] <Carbonflux> and no one listens to me on IRC, which is what i like about it.
[14:27:11] <MaNI> I have 404 twitter follows, probably 90% bots, I tweet like maybe 3 times a year, clearly I'm massively influencial
[14:27:18] <Carbonflux> heh
[14:28:19] <Renderwww> MaNI: is this the power of working in crypto?
[14:28:24] <Renderwww> so many followers
[14:28:30] <Renderwww> or you are posting dog pics all day
[14:29:03] <MaNI> no definitely from working in crypto, it gets you weird bot account followers, and occasional unsolicited messages from unhinged wierdos 
[14:29:11] <dukwon> are monkey pictures still a meme?
[14:30:47] <Carbonflux> i think so
[14:31:04] <Carbonflux> i think animals will always have some traction
[14:31:18] <Carbonflux> cats most of all
[14:31:40] <Carbonflux> but, does monkeys throwing shit at people ever really get old?
[14:31:50] <Carbonflux> perhaps.

[23:34:33] <dukwon> doing the needful was much quieter this year
[23:34:44] <dukwon> nowhere near as many sirs
