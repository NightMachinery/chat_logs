[00:38:13] <murthy> Panther: hi
[00:38:22] <murthy> Panther: How are you today?
[00:38:28] <murthy> I am little stressed
[00:39:25] <Panther> Doing great, thanks.... why stressed?
[00:39:32] <artao> well, listen to Parker's Mood. it'll help
[00:39:33] <artao> :D
[00:39:45] <artao> nice and chill and mellow and calming
[00:39:53] * Panther is still playing the Dead.
[00:40:11] <murthy> Panther: nice. stress is reducing from hearing the music you shared
[00:40:12] <murthy> ty
[00:40:17] <murthy> Panther: work stress
[00:40:26] <murthy> artao: ty
[00:40:59] <DOMF> What do you do, murthy?
[00:41:16] <murthy> DOMF: I am good, ty. How are you?
[00:41:24] <artao> i fuckin LOVE that song
[00:41:31] <murthy> DOMF: didn't sleep well for the past two days
[00:41:36] <artao> i was just tyring to work it out on piano, faileld, and so had to listen to it
[00:41:43] <murthy> 4 hrs day before yesterday and 6 hrs yesterday
[00:41:59] <artao> i can somewhat play it on trumpet, but i learned it in Bb so the fingering is all wrong to directly transpose to piano
[00:42:37] <Panther> It's also hard to blow into a piano properly.
[00:43:25] <murthy> artao: You got a trumpet?
[00:44:11] <murthy> Panther: The music is very nice
[00:44:13] <efex_> the fingerings do not directly tranaspose to or from any key.
[00:44:18] <murthy> very soothing
[00:44:19] <murthy> efex_: hi
[00:44:25] <artao> two, tho one is broken. and a coronet. also broken
[00:44:37] <murthy> artao: nice
[00:44:38] <artao> one is swappable between Bb and C, which is the one i use
[00:44:54] <efex_> hey murthy :-)
[00:44:55] <artao> i think the coronet is totally fucked. jammed valve
[00:45:11] <murthy> what a coincidence
[00:45:23] <efex_> jammed valves can be fixed.
[00:45:23] <artao> The other trumpet needs a new lead tube, or at least a patch. Which should be easy one I learn soldering/brazing
[00:45:31] <murthy> I saw a video today about cleaning a trumpet with the ultrasonic cleaner
[00:45:32] <artao> yeah, dunno about this one efex_
[00:45:39] <artao> i think something is actually bent inside
[00:45:52] <artao> also, it's been this way for like 25 yrs. so it's pretty solidly jammed now LOL
[00:46:02] <artao> i pretty much just have it for memories and decoration
[00:46:15] <artao> can't even really blow thru it for weird noises
[00:47:05] <artao> the other trumpet with the bad lead tube should be easy to fix tho. just put a little brass patch over the hole
[00:47:31] <artao> THAT one is actually silver too. VERY cool looking tarnishing on it. Deep black-purple to blues and violets
[00:47:56] <artao> the trumpet i use is, i think, nickel plated. not QUITE like silver, and never tarnishes
[00:48:06] <artao> also, i think, handmade
[00:49:35] <murthy> artao: https://youtu.be/4-pkgVyhIuU?t=678
[00:49:37] <artao> the only manufacturer on it is A. Csurcsia or Csiccia, Mannheim

[00:50:09] <efex_> repair peopel have a specific tool to put the valve tub back to round. worthis  is a different question tho
[00:50:12] <murthy> Manu Dibango is very nice
[00:50:53] <artao> perhaps efex_
[00:51:05] <artao> i suspect even pros would turn this project down and just say buy a new one
[00:51:21] <artao> i mean ... it never was a /good/ coronet. student level

[00:51:50] <murthy> DOMF: oops
[00:52:02] <murthy> DOMF: I didn't read your question correctly
[00:52:18] <DOMF> lol
[00:52:22] <murthy> DOMF: go through evidence and investigate
[00:52:25] <DOMF> yeah I just got back and saw your answer
[00:52:35] <DOMF> evidence?
[00:52:39] <DOMF> Are you a cop?
[00:52:57] <murthy> DOMF: You forgot our conversation?
[00:53:04] <DOMF> probably
[00:53:37] <murthy> DOMF: My company provides forensic services to the law enforcement
[00:54:09] <artao> soooo yeah ... if anyone knows or can find out anything about the brass instruments maker A. Csurcsia from Mannheim Germany, let me know
[00:54:17] <murthy> DOMF: I was recruited for forensic software development, but they are also using me for forensic works
[00:54:18] <DOMF> yeah I very much do not remember talking to you about that
[00:54:24] <artao> particularly in regards to dual-key nickel plated trumpets
[00:54:29] <murthy> DOMF: I hate my work
[00:54:41] <DOMF> lol yeah I would too, that sucks, sorry to hear it
[00:55:05] <murthy> DOMF: So whats the plan for the Christmas holidays?
[00:55:11] <DOMF> I love what I do, and hate who I do it for a lot less now than my last company
[00:55:14] <efex_> can you jump ship then?
[00:55:32] <murthy> DOMF: thats same for me
[00:55:33] <DOMF> I used to work in real eastate and I don't believe in private property, lol
[00:55:39] <murthy> efex_: me?
[00:56:08] <efex_> murthy:  yes
[00:56:14] <murthy> DOMF: thats nice
[00:56:17] <DOMF> Now I work in heathcare, so at least I believe in the cause more, but if I get what I want (universal healthcare for all) my job would be p much eliminated and I'd be 100% fine with that

[00:57:23] <murthy> efex_: I tried several times, but the law enforcement people call me directly and I can't say no to them
[00:57:23] <DOMF> in the Bear Republic
[00:57:49] * DOMF can and does say no to law enforcement 
[00:57:57] <efex_> universal healthcare so wins.. in canada one province’s poloitics have been taken over my ultra-right wing GOP clones… and they are try to end healthcare here :-(

[00:58:23] <artao> omg. less than 10 min. that's all i can play. and super sloppy LOL

[00:58:28] <efex_> murthy:  that sounds awful.

[01:09:45] <artao> it wasn't difficult to resist buying cigs when i was at the store, but now i'm getting bursts of sudden panic attack
[01:09:55] <artao> like something is horribly wrong and missing
[01:10:36] <Panther> You could look at all the extra money you have.
[01:10:37] <artao> hydroxyzine it is then

[01:11:12] <artao> no wait .... do you mean claustrophobia? fear of confined places
[01:11:18] <artao> if so. no. not in general

[01:11:33] <murthy> Ya I butcher the words I don't know the spelling :)
[01:11:40] <artao> i've seen the face of claustrophobic panic a coupole times, but managed to not
[01:12:09] <murthy> artao: Then face it
[01:12:09] <artao> deep in a cave midway thru a narrow is a bad time to panic
[01:12:38] <murthy> restrain yourself from not doing what you don't want to do
[01:12:48] <artao> that was the closest i've ever come. started thinking about ALLLLL that rock on top of and around me ....
[01:12:51] <murthy> if you panic then no problem
[01:13:01] <murthy> You will become normal in an hour
[01:13:04] <artao> it was totally worth the crawl tho. cool little crystal clear cave pool

[01:18:29] <artao> in that same cave with the long narrow crawl there were these super cute little bats ALLL OVVER the ceiling in one are. covered in ice. hibernation
[01:18:32] <artao> 100s of them
[01:19:03] <artao> allegedly there's the skeleton of a cow that wandered in and got lost and starved to death, but we didn't fine it

[02:45:19] <Panther> It was kinda like shop class for the kitchen.
[02:45:27] <LibertyDillo> cool
[02:45:31] <artao> exactly. kitchen and home
[02:45:38] <Panther> I did too... wood, metal, and auto.
[02:45:42] <artao> baking. i <3 baking. bread in particular
[02:45:49] <artao> i've been working on cookies
[02:46:04] <artao> i've learned honey isn't a good sugar substitute
[02:46:04] <Panther> k3wk1333z
[02:46:12] <LibertyDillo> excellent, Panther, some really useful basic life skills
[02:46:37] <LibertyDillo> really?  honey seems more healthy than sugal
[02:46:46] <LibertyDillo> *sugar
[02:47:01] <LibertyDillo> yeah maybe not for baking
[02:47:05] <artao> it just doesn't .... bake right
[02:47:18] <artao> the granularity of the sugar is important
[02:47:29] <artao> raw unprocessed sugar works tho ;)
[02:47:33] <Panther> baking is one area when I tend to follow the directions... anything else I feel free to improvise.
[02:48:33] <artao> also it's a liquid. you don't really use liquids with cookies. flour, sugar, and butter/margarine/vegetable shortening all mushed together, perhaps with a dash of milk
[02:48:43] <artao> bread tho? oh yeah
[02:48:52] <Panther> I do make nice pie crust.. nice and flaky... lard is the only way, and you need a pastry knife, and make sure to leave some lumps :)
[02:48:53] <artao> i like using honey as the sugar to activate the yeast
[02:49:10] <artao> and you can brush the top with honey in drawn butter at the end of baking
[02:49:12] <artao> mmmmmm
[02:49:53] <Panther> There you go.. that sounds good.
[02:50:12] <murthy> brb
[02:50:45] <artao> drawn butter with honey is also AWESOME on pancakes and waffles. especially mixed with peanut butter. but not chunky peanut butter for that. smooth
[02:51:26] <Panther> This is only a test. :)
[02:51:46] <DOMF> test fAILED
[02:51:48] <artao> if it were not a test you would be told where to go and what to do
[02:51:53] <Panther> If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been blown to kingdom come by now, so this message would be worthless.

[06:11:26] <maplefinger> thing is, it comes from an angry guy in the 1940s who stared at galactic rotation curves imaged on glass plates

[08:16:12] <artao> i kinda had a feeling it should be 2:1:1 .. but as this is the alst of the sugar i decided to try 1:1 first
[08:16:30] <artao> however, can't push it any further or it'll just end up tasting like cooked semi-sweet dough
[08:16:49] <artao> might hafta abandon it into some sort of .... pan-cooked "cake" of some sort or other
[08:16:57] <artao> a "pan cake" so to speak
[08:18:27] <artao> but also there's a variance of 25 to 50 degrees between the oven dial and my oven thermometer, and i have no idea which is more correct
[08:18:31] <artao> so yeah
[08:18:33] <artao> there's taht
[08:18:58] <artao> added another cup of flour and a splash of milk. maybe 1/4 cup of so
[08:19:12] <artao> i LITTLE "doughy" now, but that could work too. i have pancake syrup
[08:19:57] <sdragon> Use a second thermometer?

[08:36:27] <artao> i mean, how hard can it be, ya know?
[08:43:36] <artao> i'm on the right track with the cookies i think. test 2, the ball of dough was very meh, but the flattened one was much better
[08:43:40] <artao> so .. FLATTER
[08:43:45] <artao> go more for crispness
[08:43:51] <artao> carmelize the sugar more
[08:44:11] <artao> the ball one was quite floury, and the flattened one a bit too
[08:48:56] <Panther> In the mathematical study of functional analysis, the Banach–Mazur distance is a way to define a distance on the set Q ( n ) {\displaystyle Q(n)} {\displaystyle Q(n)} of n {\displaystyle n} n-dimensional normed spaces. With this distance, the set of isometry classes of n {\displaystyle n} n-dimensional normed spaces becomes a compact metric space, called the Banach–Mazur compactum.
