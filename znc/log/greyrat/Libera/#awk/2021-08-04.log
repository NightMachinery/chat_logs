[12:10:22] <snappy> does anyone know why this awk command doesn't work with original awk -- i believe it has problems with the concatenation of g".txt":  awk '/.*==<New/{g++} { print $0 > g".txt" }' input
[12:11:32] <Patsie> with original awk you mean nawk ?
[12:11:42] <geirha> well, you should close() the file when you're done writing to it, but what's the error message?
[12:11:56] <Patsie> I don't really see anything wrong with it though
[12:12:21] <snappy> so MacOS ships with awk, and when i run awk --version i get: awk version 20200816 -- i assume this is thje original one that's released by Brian Kernighan
[12:12:22] <Patsie> (apart from geirha's close() remark, although awk does that at script end as well)
[12:12:48] <geirha> it may hit a too many open files limit before it gets to the end
[12:12:57] <snappy> Oh according to wikipedia it looks like nawk, yeah
[12:12:59] <Patsie> the original is oawk (old awk) and is hardly ever used anywhere anymore, nawk is the new one-true-awk
[12:13:39] <Patsie> but yeah, as geirha requested: what's the error you get?
[12:13:59] <snappy> oh let me paste on a site
[12:16:27] <snappy> https://dpaste.com/2KZUQ29CZ
[12:18:07] <geirha> aha. Well, one option is to surround it with (). ... > (g".txt")
[12:18:34] <geirha> though I'd more likely generate the filename with sprintf, zeropadding that number
[12:18:51] <snappy>  oh that's a good idea
[12:19:15] <geirha> awk '/==<New/{ if (f) close(f); f = sprintf("%03d.txt", ++g) } { print > f }'
[12:19:44] <snappy> why do we need to surround with parenthesis?
[12:21:16] <geirha> The parenthesis makes sure it concatenates g and ".txt" before using it with the > operator. But I'm not sure why it doesn't like the unparenthesised version
[12:21:59] <snappy> yeah i forgot to mention this was fine with gawk
[12:23:01] <geirha> mawk also accepts it
[12:23:12] <geirha> just some weird parser quirk, probably
[12:27:57] <snappy> well much appreciated for the fix, i like sticking with nawk

[15:35:17] <snappy> i think i understand why the parenthesis is needed, because there's ambiguity in print $0 > g".txt" it can either be print ($0 > g".txt") or print $0 > (g".txt") -- you need parens to break the ambiguity
[15:40:05] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[15:47:47] <geirha> I would guess it rather tries to parse it as print ($0 > g) ".txt"

[15:55:36] <earnestly> I recall nawk needing redirections to variables to be complete beforehand.  E.g. print $0 > var ".bar" would fail, but dest = var ".bar"; print > dest would work
[15:55:57] <earnestly> Maybe > (var ".bar") would have solved that
