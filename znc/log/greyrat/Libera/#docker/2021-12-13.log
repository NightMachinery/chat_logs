[04:24:56] <supay> why does FROM nginx in my dockerimage automatically choose an alpine-based image? can i get it to use ubuntu or some debian-derivative instead?
[04:25:45] <wez> supay: yes, specify the tag of the version and os you want to use.
[04:25:57] <wez> the default is to use alpine and the latest version

[04:27:05] <supay> wez, interesting. when i search 'ubuntu' or 'debian' in the tags, it doesn't show anything
[04:27:08] <supay> yes, haha, exactly
[04:27:32] <DoofusCanadensis> that's just the package manager they used when creating the image
[04:27:34] <wez> supay: oh well, alpine it is

[04:28:22] <wez> If you want to, I don't see the point of doing that though, just run another container using debian or ubuntu if you need that distro for something.
[04:28:23] <supay> DoofusCanadensis, when i enter the container shell and cat /etc/os-release, it says alpine..
[04:28:47] <wez> alpine is very lightweight and good for Docker images though
[04:28:48] <DoofusCanadensis> yes, the package manager tends to include os-release as well
[04:28:59] <supay> oh! that's interesting
[04:29:31] <DoofusCanadensis> I happen to run all my containers on debian hosts... doesn't mean I need to have created the image using a debian base

[04:50:13] <supay> ah, that makes sense. i'm trying to customise nginx to add a bot blocker. so i'm doing FROM nginx. Let me try nginx:latest and see if it gets a debian-based version instead!
[04:51:38] <supay> ok, didn't work by changing to FROM nginx:latest. so let me also do docker pull nginx:latest to clear cache
[04:52:52] <minimal> supay: "FROM nginx" means the same as "FROM nginx:latest" - if you do not specify a tag then "latest" is assumed
[04:54:31] <minimal> generally speaking you should not use "latest" as you never know which version you are on (building an image using "latest" now, and again in 5 minutes/hours/days time, could give you different contents if the "latest" tag is updated in the meantime to point to a newer version)

[05:26:12] <roycroft> i'm familiar with what docker is and does, but i've not used it until very recently
[05:26:45] <roycroft> i have an app that is difficult to install, and it was suggested that i run a docker image of it, which i did
[05:27:47] <roycroft> not being familiar with the mechanics of how docker does things, i'll mention that to install this app i cloned a git repository for it, cd'ed to the clone directory, and then did docker-compose pull
[05:27:49] <roycroft> and then started it up
[05:28:21] <roycroft> it's working fine, but i need to access some files that are part of the docker container, and that's where i'm confused
[05:28:54] <roycroft> i thought i'd find some location where all these files would be available, but what i find is that a bunch of directories were created in /var/lib/docker/overlay2
[05:29:06] <roycroft> man docker is not particularly useful

RUN do your stuff -/- or potentially use a volume to contain those files ((for 'editing' generally a bad idea as having the volume there stops getting the file updated from upstream forever))

[05:56:36] <tabakhase> it helps - until precisely 2 weeks later when that container died, you make a new one and everyone forgot what the mods where :D :D
[05:57:24] <roycroft> this particular package is built such that everything is stored in the database

[15:05:22] <supay> tabakhase, i'm confused right now.. if i have an nginx dockerfile that customises nginx for me.. do i need to create my container via build within docker-compose?
[15:05:54] <tabakhase> pretty much yes
[15:06:18] <tabakhase> but more a "can" than a "need" in the end
[15:06:44] <supay> ah i see, but why doesn't docker compose up reflect the changes? i'm trying to understand what docker compose up does internally..
[15:07:05] <tabakhase> up = container create && container start
[15:07:34] <tabakhase> so technically "it doesnt touch images at all" - BUT when a image is not found, it will try to pull it, or even try to build it

[22:00:56] <rawtaz> pastebin.com or similar works
[22:00:59] <rawtaz> kopy.io for example
[22:01:31] <notevil> sounds like you need to rebuild the image.  docker-compose doesn't auto rebuild on changes.

[22:02:39] <rawtaz> you can `docker-compose build`

[23:04:20] <iffraff> Hi, I have a strange thing, I have a Dockerfile, it has COPY ./babel.config.js ./babel.config.js which works, when I exec into the running container the babel file is there, then I have COPY ./app ./app  and inside the running container I do have the directory app but it's empty!  none of the contents from the host.  Does anyone know hwat could be going on with that?
[23:05:32] <rawtaz> did you actually build the image after that second COPY was added?
[23:05:44] <rawtaz> perhaps you are running a copy of the image that doesnt have that
[23:07:08] <iffraff> yes.  I'm removing and then building
[23:07:45] *** Joins: junktext_ (~junktext@gateway/vpn/pia/junktext)
[23:08:21] <rawtaz> let us know how it works out
[23:09:17] <iffraff> The only unusual thing is that I'm using docker-compose.  I have two different docker-compose files.  One starts up the api and the db, the other the web app.  ( this is in development, so I have the web app running in a little server )  so I'm doing docker-compose -f ../../docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.yml
[23:10:05] <iffraff> Now that doesn't seem like it should effect much, although it totally screws up my relative paths, but that is not the problme here because the file right next to the app directory is being copied fine
[23:10:41] <rawtaz> should be fine, as long as they are actually using/referring to the image that you are concerned about
[23:11:44] *** Joins: Mattiaslndstrm (~Mattiasln@c213-103-137-235.bredband.tele2.se)
[23:11:48] <iffraff> I presume so, I'm modifying the actual dockerFile in question and those changes show when I exec into the running container.
[23:12:05] <iffraff> So why would the app contents not be copied?
[23:12:36] <rawtaz> ok nice
[23:12:42] <rawtaz> well again, make sure to rebuild the image
[23:12:59] <rawtaz> if it still doesnt work please kopy.io or similar the Dockerfile and the compose files

[23:24:15] <iffraff> Interesting I'm copying everything to another directory after all the initial stuff like so 
[23:24:15] <iffraff> RUN mkdir /home/omg RUN cp -R . ../omg WORKDIR /home/omg.  when I remove that the app file is copied over with it's contents. 
[23:24:42] <iffraff> it's been a while since I set that up and hopefully I don't still need to do the copy.  That would be the easiest win
[23:25:57] <rawtaz> just for the record, i classify that as "doesnt work" :-)
[23:28:11] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:28:30] <iffraff> you classify what as doesn't work?  the fact that I have to copy it to omg, the fact that it doesn't work when I do copy it to omg?  or the fact that it now only works when I copy it to omg :)
[23:29:50] <rawtaz> the latter - what you wrote sounds to me like a workaround for something that should work. im saying i classify that as the initial thing still not working :P

[23:30:58] <iffraff> true, true, I have not discovered the source of the problem, I have just worked around it. However, I have to pick my battles. 
[23:33:11] <rawtaz> well
[23:33:51] <rawtaz> all i can say is wat i said before. in order to help you we need the Dockerfile and the compose files. until you provide those we can only speculate and thats mostly a waste of time compared to just looking at the files and determining the cause of the problem
