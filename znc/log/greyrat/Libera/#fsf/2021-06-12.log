[02:58:37] <leah> i don't get it
[02:58:51] <corwin> it felt like there's been a "someone else's problem" field around the whole "owned by Freenode Limited" thing for quite some time.
[02:59:05] <leah> ah
[02:59:22] <leah> i recognize your nick. you're from fosshost right?
[02:59:29] <corwin> Ops limited by not wanting to "taunt the bear" is what it feels like in hindsight, which is perfectly understandable but not exactly healthy.
[02:59:42] <corwin> that's right, I'm the coo, #2 person sorta
[02:59:48] <leah> i really admire what fosshost did:
[02:59:50] <leah> https://fosshost.org/news/libera-chat
[02:59:54] <leah> https://fosshost.org/news/freenode
[02:59:58] <leah> it's... great. i love it
[03:00:01] <leah> > moves to libera chat
[03:00:06] <leah> > enters into partnership with freenode
[03:00:18] <corwin> well... thanks.
[03:00:34] <leah> well, i'm confused
[03:00:50] <leah> to me it just looks like mixed signals, or maybe you're just neutral about the whole thing
[03:01:13] <leah> or is it... move to libera but take freenode's money. while using libera
[03:01:44] <leah> i'm not attacking btw. i'm just confused
[03:01:46] <corwin> sure, I can see that.  we're hoping to influence mr lee toward more self-governance modesl for operating freenode, as well as toward community standards that align, generally, with what we see looking out over the FOSS community.  Meanwhile, this network is a good fit for our own projects IRC needs.
[03:02:01] <leah> ok
[03:03:31] <leah> i ultimately think freenode will be run benevolently in the long term. the people that took it over experienced an ego high from the sudden power they got
[03:03:49] <leah> but as they have witnessed, if they act like jackasses, people leave. including fsf
[03:04:04] <leah> so they'll start wising up i think
[03:04:17] <leah> i mean yeah, it was a fucking coup
[03:04:27] <corwin> that eskimo resigned or whtv is a hugely good sign is all I'm prepared to state about the future of things, at this point.   but I can say, so far andrew has been good to each specific we have agreed to.
[03:06:04] <leah> money talks, eh?
[03:07:24] <leah> unfortunately, i think freenode is permanently tainted now. andrew lee is used to running private, for-profit companies, then suddenly takes over a non-profit IRC network, that hosts free software projects
[03:07:34] <niko> corwin: it's unrelated to the removal of the https://freenode.net/catalysts page ?
[03:07:45] <leah> his authoritarian style is natural for his companies, but not for a community network like freenode
[03:08:55] <leah> well, at this point, i don't think people will trust him. and i actually think he seems like a decent bloke. i mean he created private internet access. (which has it's share of problems, for eample the PIA client is non-free, but you cn use the vpn service without using the PIA client, and the network is very good. reliable, you can just use the barebones openvpn client if you wish)
[03:09:05] <corwin> niko: I don't have a response to that yet.  that happened while our board was out of session over the weekend and I haven't had a chance to find out if we share an opinion from a Fosshost board standpoint.  I'd like to know that before I start commenting to others.  It def deserves a response from us and had been brought for discussion tonight/tomorrow as we resume.
[03:09:07] <leah> i've used pia in the past. but not with the pia client
[03:09:18] <corwin> s/weekend/work-week
[03:09:27] <leah> and PIA was (is) a well respected vpn provider
[03:10:15] <leah> yeah and andrew is probably high up on the spectrum. then suddenly he saw a bunch of freenode staff form libera, and say stuff about him that he didn't like. and he overreacted

[03:11:11] <leah> i looked at his responses and didn't see some evil person, just someone who was overwhelmed, not expecting things to go so badly, and then he just sort of dug his grave further

[03:11:30] *** Joins: murphnj (~murph@user/murphnj)
[03:11:41] <leah> meh. fsf has moved now
[03:11:46] <leah> that means it's a done deal. freenode is finished
[03:11:55] <leah> if the fsf is deserting you, you know you fucked up :)
[03:12:12] <Xenguy> leah, No, freenode is "taking IRC to the next level!"
[03:12:26] <Xenguy> Whatever that is
[03:12:35] <leah> thing is
[03:13:05] <leah> this whole drama only started because freenode staff didn't like the takeover, and bitched about it. which is fair, they had their jobs ruthlessly taken away from them. so they made libera
[03:13:17] <xse> communication is still a huge issue like with the whole nickserv drama recently
[03:13:25] <leah> but in their announcements, they never said why andrew lee is bad
[03:14:07] <leah> and the claims they made about freenode ltd wanting private data about users was unfounded. they'd have as much ability to abuse their power as the former staff did, and we'd be just as clueless most likely that such a thing is going on
[03:14:25] <leah> i mean when you think about it, it was basically a smear campaign
[03:14:46] <leah> but then they had every right to create libera
[03:15:18] <corwin> as I said, as a project freenode has had some structural issues for some time
[03:15:44] <leah> does that mean libera has issues?
[03:16:03] <leah> because now the new staff is the former freenode staff. what structural issues did you identify?
[03:16:12] <corwin> in creating this network, those of which I was aware of are or are being handled, and handled fairly well.  for example the bylaws and mode of continuation if someone important dies are clear.
[03:16:30] <leah> ok
[03:16:48] <leah> i literally do not trust libera or freenode btw
[03:17:09] <leah> that's why i've decided to create my own ircd for my projects. haven't done it yet though, had other things to do
[03:17:14] <corwin> IRC, like Free Software, attracts people for whom trust of strangers doesn't come easy, imo
[03:17:30] <leah> i trusted freenode before, with the former staff running it
[03:17:33] *** Joins: JorgeMorais (~user@189.6.35.8)
[03:17:42] <leah> but then the former staff created all this drama
[03:17:50] <leah> and also freenode itself had a hostile takeover
[03:18:29] <leah> the new freenode staff i have no idea about long term, whether they'll be good (i'm letting their recent shitty behaviour slide. they were freaking out pretty hard probably, and they're only human)
[03:18:43] <corwin> most FOSS developer/user IRC ppl still do trust those same people, hence the rapid growth of this network.  I mean, you need to make your own call here but I think the "what will people do" card has been filled, now.
[03:19:04] <leah> well, it means that my projects had a rug pulled from under them
[03:19:14] <corwin> that was all pretty bad
[03:19:14] <leah> people literally created channels for all my projects, on libera, without my consent
[03:19:25] <corwin> ug
[03:19:27] <leah> i literally had no idea this was going on until a day or so later
[03:19:55] <leah> so i was dragged to libera against my will. i managed to gain control over all my channels here (that were registered by others, to replace the freenode chans)
[03:19:57] <leah> so basically
[03:20:05] <leah> someone made the decision for me that i should move my projects to libera
[03:20:15] <leah> and that wasn't cool
[03:20:16] <corwin> yeah, that would be a turn off.  understand everyone was acting a bit rashly, perhaps expect the libera ops who seemed to have planned fairly carefully once they decided the fn situation could not be otherwise salvaged.
[03:20:37] <crabbedhaloablut> leah: you could always close the channels. Libera will do that and honor your request.
[03:20:50] <leah> i was *this* close to dropping them, and siding with freenode, like, taking a pro-freenode stance, because i initially saw it as former freenode staff (now libera staff) stirring shit for no reason
[03:20:56] <leah> yeah but then the other stuff happened
[03:21:15] <leah> and if i dropped my channels on libera now, people would claim them again. and maybe libera will over take freenode, and freenode will just die
[03:21:17] <leah> so yeah
[03:21:36] <leah> i normally prefer to self-host, but was ok outsourcing irc, because freenode seemed very stable, bullet proof even
[03:21:37] <crabbedhaloablut> leah: You can actually claim them and keep them closed.
[03:21:46] <leah> big mistake, that i will never make again

[03:23:40] <corwin> not very "self-governing" which was the concern I'd had with FN for the last while (year or two, I guess).  In fact they were but very secretly and not quite in control of everything actually and not fessing out about that, is what it looks like to me now.
[03:23:44] <leah> and *that* is my true feeling about this nonsense
[03:24:13] <corwin> I mean, feeling jerked around seems quite reasonable.
[03:24:15] <leah> libera and freenode are both toxic. which makes them equal
[03:24:29] <corwin> I know a bunch of people are not on IRC at all at this point, which I find sad.

[03:26:00] <leah> just how i feel about the whole thing
[03:26:43] <corwin> if andrew can drop the competition thing and see that there is some model community building happening with the libera chat project it's hard to know what's possible.
[03:26:59] <corwin> but for now... glad eskimo isn't having an oline over there.
[03:27:08] <leah> no more. i'm drawing a line in the sand. i will self-host my own ircd as soon as i have time to set it up

[23:30:03] <Noisytoot> <buzel> we will have fsf member cloaks here?
[23:30:03] <Noisytoot> <ggoes> in the near future, but not right now
