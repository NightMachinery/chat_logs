[08:07:36] <chronon> badfilms: You make a fair point. Perhaps the benefits of tmux are more subjective than is apparent to me.
[08:07:40] <chronon> Nevertheless, I have actually moved *more* of my workflow from GUI to tmux over the years *even* for completely local work.
[08:07:45] <chronon> Every time I have to break the flow of thought at the keyboard, reach for the mouse, wiggle it to see where the pointer is, move it to something, position it carefully, click or drag, then do more clicking and dragging to put windows back where they were, then move my hands back to the keyboard, not only do those physical movements slow everything down they also break the mental context of the editing I'm

[08:10:39] <chronon> I'm always looking for recommendations and listening to other's experience.
[08:10:43] <nickspoon> I like i3 for X and sway for wayland
[08:10:52] <badfilms> nickspoon: That is true. Pick the right tool for the job. In my case, I just need a hammer, so there is no need for a multitool. But for others, they need more things

[08:11:40] <nickspoon> I don't _need_ it
[08:11:44] <nickspoon> But it makes life easier
[08:11:46] <chronon> What is i3 like to customise? Is it very flexible? What's the config file like?
[08:11:58] <chronon> Is it scriptable?
[08:12:22] *** Joins: justinf210 (~justinf21@152.sub-97-44-1.myvzw.com)
[08:12:45] <nickspoon> I use it for session management, and I have some scripts I use to initialise sessions, which e.g. open a tmux session with multiple windows, one for code, one for tests, one for .. various things
[08:13:09] <chronon> Sounds like a nice setup. I should try to get to that point.
[08:13:56] <igemnace> chronon: i3 has a pretty wide set of options. generally covers a lot of use cases. the config file uses its own DSL, but it's a very simple one
[08:14:03] <chronon> But there are s many tiling window managers and I'm never sure which is being actively developed. Or which one is built in which language, which might make a difference to me if I need to hack it at some point.
[08:14:22] <nickspoon> hopefully i3 isn't being very actively developed
[08:14:29] <chronon> :)
[08:14:32] <nickspoon> It's simple. It works. It shouldn't have more features
[08:14:40] <chronon> Fair enough.
[08:14:41] <nickspoon> I know that with sway they consider it "done"
[08:14:52] <nickspoon> I believe i3 is pretty much the same
[08:14:53] <phy1729> Just start trying one? I also like i3, but all I really want from a wm is vertical splits

[08:15:13] <chronon> Taht's very specific.
[08:15:21] <igemnace> chronon: you can send actions to i3 (e.g. focus this workspace, focus this window, etc) using i3-message, which allows you to script i3, yes. you can also use i3 for setting up keybindings for arbitrary executables (e.g. custom scripts), if you want
[08:15:24] <badfilms> There's also Pop_OS! which is an Ubuntu flavor with a built-in tiling WM if you don't care about configuration
[08:15:35] *** Quits: samhain (~samhain@user/samhain) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[08:16:13] <chronon> Sounds good.
[08:16:32] <badfilms> but i3 is always a safe bet. It has been around for a while and is usually the WM people turn to. Some distros (like Manjaro) also have i3 builds if you want to try it
[08:16:38] <chronon> I mean the i3 scriptability sounds good.
[08:16:39] <igemnace> phy1729: same! that and workspaces for me. honestly any WM would probably have worked; i3 was simply the one i tried first
[08:17:09] <badfilms> WM + Workspaces is something I can't live without
[08:17:23] <phy1729> oh right workspaces, those kinda just fade from conscious use in my experience
[08:17:34] <Kyv> There is abduco for standalone session management, and it is not difficult to portably script spawning workspaces in any window manager that stays out of the way.
[08:18:48] <chronon> I am still using Unity on later versions of Ubuntu because I like the fact it doesn't waste screen. Gnome is going in an awful direction in that respect, even putting buttons in what was the title bar, thus making the distance between top of window and content enormous.
[08:18:54] <Kyv> The session management feature is the reason people stick with tmux well after they switch from multiplexer to tiling. Simply because the alternatives dont have such.. big mouths. 
[08:19:53] <phy1729> heh, I've got no title bars; just a 1 px border around windows and a status bar at the bottom
[08:20:02] <chronon> Sounds perfect!
[08:20:27] <badfilms> I also disable titlebars, but my statusbar is at the top (but it is only active when I want it to be or mouse into it)
[08:21:14] <chronon> I do still like indicator-multiload the little resource usage graphs in the top indicator bar. Would like work with i3?
[08:21:32] <badfilms> chronon: If you currently use Ubuntu, you should take Pop_OS! for a test drive. It will feel familiar, but it has a pretty nice set of defaults. And being that you are using Unity, it sounds like you might be doing game dev? In that case, the Nvidia support in Pop_OS! is really good.

[08:21:48] <igemnace> same: no titlebars. statusbar at the top
[08:22:38] <chronon> No not Untity the game engine, Unity the desktop environment that Canonical sadly dropped a few Ubuntu releases ago.
[08:22:46] <badfilms> Oh gotcha missed that
[08:22:47] <nickspoon> I don't even have a border on my windows, which I like
[08:23:12] <nickspoon> Although a added a thing where borders get added when i3 is in "resize mode", so I can drag them with the mouse if I want to
[08:23:13] <igemnace> badfilms: system76 in general is pretty interesting. really pushing linux desktop to audiences you always usually just concede to windows or macos, e.g. for gaming
[08:23:21] <nickspoon> (hardly ever use them, but it was interesting to add)
[08:23:43] <igemnace> nickspoon: oh! hadn't thought of that -- borders in resize mode
[08:23:53] <chronon> I would be very sad without my indicator-multiload graphs in the bar at the top. Does anyone use anything like that with i3 or other tiling wm>
[08:24:03] <nickspoon> yeah, especially useful for floating windows when I (rarely) use them
[08:24:04] <igemnace> not that i resize frequently, but it sounds like a nice indicator
[08:24:17] <badfilms> igemnace: Agreed. I think it is doing a great job at bringing linux to a broader audience. Also, apparently Windows 11 won't support many processors/builds, so linux has an opportunity to grab more of the market
[08:24:30] <badfilms> igemnace: And gaming is always a good gateway. The proton support is really impressive right now
[08:24:51] <igemnace> chronon: in general, conky is what i see people use for system stats/indicators
[08:25:50] <nickspoon> igemnace: pretty simple: http://ix.io/3rI4
[08:25:53] <igemnace> badfilms: definitely, such huge strides when it was only a few years ago that i was looking into wine gaming and simply accepting certain tradeoffs
[08:25:57] <chronon> Hmm, but conky is a desktop background thing, withh a wide range of information, right? Not a tiny little set of resource graphs that fit into a permanently visible status bar.

[08:28:23] <chronon> Does i3 allow a small window to sit in front of the corner of a larger window (eg a calculator in the top right corner of a tmux session) while you work? Or do all splits have to be verticle or horizonal and that's it?
[08:28:24] <igemnace> badfilms: ah, i hadn't heard about lutris. definitely interesting as well
[08:28:44] <nickspoon> chronon: yes you can do that in i3
[08:28:47] <igemnace> chronon: yes, it allows for that. you can toggle windows to become floating, and floating windows always appear on top of tiled windows
[08:28:52] <chronon> Cool. Thanks.
[08:29:07] <nickspoon> And if you're using a compositor like picom then you can give it a low opacity
[08:29:47] <chronon> Interesting.

[08:30:32] <chronon> Hmmm, so is a floating window outside of the normal keyboard navigation, like going back to a traditional window manager?
[08:30:33] <nickspoon> Or toggle the current window into fullscreen mode, so all other windows are hidden
[08:30:34] <igemnace> i actually like being able to drag windows with super + mouse drag
[08:31:04] <nickspoon> no, you hit a shortcut like  super+space to switch focus to floating windows
[08:31:14] <igemnace> chronon: in general, the up/down/left/right movements try to infer what you mean when hopping across floating windows. there's also an explicit toggle for your window "cursor": either hop across floating windows or tiled windows
[08:31:18] <nickspoon> you can also move and resize them with the keyboard

[08:31:39] <chronon> Wow, sounds like lots to learn.

[08:32:24] <nickspoon> And you define all the shortcuts yourself in your config, so they are easy to look up and change
[08:32:27] <chronon> Thanks for all the recommendations, I shall definition have to give it a try.

[16:04:48] <chronon> In other words run: update-alternatives --display vim
[16:05:11] <stutz> that's ubuntu only fwiw
[16:05:43] <stutz> allegra_: just make sure that you only have one vim installed
[16:06:35] <chronon> I didn't know it was ubuntu only. That's a surprise.
[16:07:34] <ohuwuteu> ubuntu is full of twists
[16:07:45] <chronon> How does Debian handle multiple programs that wish to claim the same name?
[16:08:19] <allegra_> here's what it ouptuts https://termbin.com/lj0g
[16:08:36] <allegra_> Running Linux Mint over here
[16:08:48] <stutz> which is just another ubuntu fork
[16:08:54] <chronon> Isn't Linux Mint an Ubuntu derrivative?
[16:09:00] <stutz> so I guess update-alternatives is a thing there too
[16:09:15] <allegra_> it is
[16:09:16] <stutz> but my initial statement still stands, just have one vim installed.
[16:09:33] <stutz> there's no need to have both, vim and neovim 
[16:09:37] <allegra_> How do I interpret the output ?
[16:09:42] <allegra_> stutz: Will do
[16:10:40] <stutz> I don't know how to interpret the output because I never used update-alternatives.
[16:11:19] <chronon> If you mean the update-alternatives --display vim command, it should say in fairly readable English which alternatives claiming the name "vim" are on your system, and which it considered to be the currently selected one.
[16:11:31] <stutz> if I had to guess tho I'd say without setting a default it tries to guess the app and in your case it thinks you want neovim
[16:11:38] <chronon> To change it you run update-alternatives --config vim
[16:13:15] <allegra_> I get it but still I don't know how to read this https://termbin.com/lj0g 
[16:14:34] <chronon> Ok, so that mean you have vim.basic and neovim installed, and it considers neovim the best and curently selected one.
[16:14:55] <allegra_> what is vim.basic
[16:14:57] <allegra_> ?
[16:15:15] <stutz> vim.basic I assume is the default vim that ships with mint/ubuntu so given that you've manually installed neovim the system thinks that when you execute vim you want the one that you have installed
[16:15:26] <chronon> vim.basic would be *too* basic for me. I install vim.gtk3 because that has Gnom clipboard support, etc.
[16:16:09] <chronon> apt install -y vim.gtk3
[16:16:10] <stutz> the best way to understand the output is by reading the man page of update-alternatives allegra_ 
[16:16:30] <stutz> its not really vim related, it's just something ubuntu/mint does and you'd have to consult with their docs
[16:16:31] <chronon> Then update-alternatives --config vim and select vim.gtk3
[16:16:59] *** Parts: npoirot (~nicolas@88.122.0.68) ()
[16:17:00] <stutz> or (third time) just install the vim that you want and remove the rest :shrug:
[16:17:32] <chronon> It's sometimes nice to have both, but have vim point at vim.gtk3 while nvim still points at neovim.
[16:17:47] <stutz> there is literally no case where that'd make sense
[16:18:01] <stutz> correction: there is one case!
[16:18:10] <chronon> Why do you say that? (Never used neovim myself.)
[16:18:40] <stutz> the one case where it would make sense is if you are a plugin author and want to support both, vim and neovim. then you'd have to have both to test it
[16:18:42] *** Quits: cadderly (~~@user/cadderly) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:18:51] <chronon> ok
[16:19:08] <chronon> So is there literally no functional difference between them then?
[16:19:10] <stutz> why would I say that? the real question is why would you suggest that it is nice to have both?
[16:19:29] <stutz> nothing that'd justify to use both
[16:20:06] <stutz> there are obviously api differences and some features in each editor but nothing that'd be a reason to randomly switch the editor for a edit or what ever
[16:20:08] <chronon> I have both irssi and weechat installed.

[22:52:22] <badfilms> I personally don't get any value out of that feature. It is used to quick scroll, which is nice outside of vim, but not really necessary inside of vim. For example, if you are using the overview bar to see where the errors are, inside of vim, you usually have mappings to jump from error to error. It is also used to know where in the document you are, but in vim, we have `p%%` in the statusline,
[22:52:24] <badfilms> showing your location in the document. For me, the overview bar is just more distracting than anything.

[23:07:54] <badfilms> I haven't benched it, but I use it in large code bases without issue. I am just mentioning it because I assume you are looking for this functionality, so since it exists, if you want to either port it (write your own) or use it, you have something to start with
[23:08:31] *** Quits: sapzk (~sapzk@user/sapzk) (Quit: WeeChat 3.1)
[23:08:35] <Helmholtz1> badfilms, the main problem is that that 99 is hardcoded into vim (and neovim) codebase
[23:08:51] <Helmholtz1> Does it really affect performance that bad?
[23:09:28] <badfilms> Yeah there are some annoying things that are probably relics from ages ago. It might be worth doing a PR with that change
[23:09:46] <badfilms> But then again, vim rolls its own regex engine
[23:09:56] <badfilms> and neovim doesnt touch Bram's implementation

[23:40:00] <ezzieyguywuf> oh dang
[23:40:01] <badfilms> But I am not sure how a swap file configuration would be affecting your working directory. I'd be curious if it is actually a plugin issue.
[23:40:08] <ezzieyguywuf> could be
[23:40:24] <ezzieyguywuf> this is my vimrc http://dpaste.com/FCP2QY5J8
[23:40:32] <ezzieyguywuf> though unless I can duplicate the issue I doubt we'll ever know for sure

[23:42:13] <badfilms> Your vimrc is very concise, so it should be easy to isolate an issue if it exists. For example, you can binary search your plugins by commenting them out (you can keep commentary enabled since that isn't the problem).

[23:53:10] <ezzieyguywuf> maybe I should just not use :set path then?
