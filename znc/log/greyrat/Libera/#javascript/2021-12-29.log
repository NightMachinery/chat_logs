[00:38:13] <twiclo> Thanks for the help but you guys really gotta stop making assumptions about people asking for help. Could it be possible that I just want to learn regexes and this is an exercise I found?
[00:38:53] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@51.52.78.152)
[00:39:22] <ljharb> twiclo: DSL - domain-specific language
[00:39:30] <twiclo> I know what a DSL is
[00:39:36] <ljharb> twiclo: and sure, it could be possible! but you aren't learning regexes if the exercise you're using teaches you bad habits
[00:39:40] <ljharb> !xy
[00:39:41] <jellobot> ljharb, The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X. See also: http://xyproblem.info/
[00:39:42] <twiclo> I'm wondering why you think I'm working with one
[00:40:04] <ljharb> twiclo: because if you weren't then you'd have no idea what you want your regex to match
[00:40:11] <twiclo> What bad habbit did the exercise teach me? Could the exercise be language specific with just test input?
[00:40:13] <ljharb> twiclo: you're automatically working with one by using regeces
[00:40:16] <ljharb> *regexes
[00:40:21] <twiclo> I am definitely not working with a DSL
[00:40:33] <twiclo> I mean I guess if you consider regex a DSL then sure
[00:40:35] <ljharb> twiclo: it might be an implicit one, but of course you are. every regex input is a dsl
[00:40:42] <ljharb> not consider, it is one
[00:40:43] <twiclo> Seemed to me you thought "user= butts" was a DSL
[00:40:47] <ljharb> it is
[00:40:56] <twiclo> Now you're just being pedantic
[00:41:06] <twiclo> How is a string a DSL?
[00:41:08] <ljharb> no, i'm using the actual meanings of words the way they're intended
[00:41:13] <ljharb> a string by itself isn't necessarily a dsl
[00:41:23] *** Joins: ckdCreations (~ckdCreati@147.55.133.142)
[00:41:26] <twiclo> So how is "user= butts" a DSL?
[00:41:29] <ljharb> but if you're trying to regex-match it, then obviously you have SOME kind of expectation of the input. that expectation is the DSL
[00:41:41] <ljharb> "it contains an equals sign" is a DSL, for example
[00:42:03] <ljharb> but all this could be avoided if you jumped to explaining what you're actually doing :-) which is always what everyone should be opening with
[00:42:09] <twiclo> Yeah that's just unnecessary pedantry that wastes time
[00:42:25] <ljharb> what wastes time is not telling us your actual context right out the gate
[00:42:35] <ljharb> instead you're *assuming* that that isn't relevant, and instead asking about a regex thing
[00:42:36] <twiclo> All this could have been avoided if you just assumed I know that I want to use regexes for this. I came in telling you the string I wanted to match. What more explanation is needed?
[00:42:52] <twiclo> If I want to learn regexes then nothing else is relevant
[00:42:53] <ljharb> my assumption, based on decades of doing this, is that you probably are wrong about that
[00:43:07] <ljharb> if you want to learn regexes then you need to learn when is and isn't appropriate to use them
[00:43:21] <ljharb> this isn't google. it's not "plug in a problem and get a free expert solution" either.
[00:43:31] <twiclo> Is it appropriate to use them when I sit down and decide to learn how to use them?
[00:43:32] <ljharb> we can't tell you the best way to solve your problem until we know WHY it's a problem

[00:51:13] <avu> don't stop now, I just got popcorn!
[00:53:54] <twiclo> I was born in 1993. It wouldn't be for about 7 years that I realized I really liked technology. I started tinkering with the VCR and figured out how to record SNES footage onto a VHS. It was really cool. Years later I found my dad hacking away at a terminal on his computer and wanted to learn more. He told me about the underpinnings of a computer and I knew I was hooked. I learned all about
[00:53:56] <twiclo> networking when I wanted to set up a halo lan party at my house. When college rolled around I decided to major in computer science and began working on fun little side projects in my spare time. My first real project was a simple cli for twitch which I wrote to help me get streams onto the TVs at my office. BY THIS POINT I HAD HEARD OF REGEXES but considered them too complex to figure out for
[00:53:58] <twiclo> my first project. After that I got a real programmer job and have been toying around with rust/linux ever since. The other day I ran into a problem that could really use a regex but I ended up having to use many lines of string manipulation to solve the problem. It felt not very clean so I decided I would sit down and learn regexes. So I typed up a bunch of test strings that I'm supposed to
[00:54:00] <twiclo> create a JSON out of and have been working to get a regex that parses all of these lines. I thought I had one written up that worked really good. I mean regex101.com said they all parsed but as soon as I put it into node it didn't work. I thought that was odd so I asked in the javascript irc channel for help on why my regex might look wrong. After two hours and explaining my life story I still
[00:54:02] <twiclo> don't have the answer
[00:56:36] <ljharb> thanks, that's helpful. so you have an actual problem with real non-contrived input and output, and you want to bridge that with a regex. care to share those, so we can best help?

[10:34:36] <farkaan> I'm learning webdev with react right now (not interested in webdev but it's a recommended course by the college), and I have one simple question. Do I use semicolons for terminating statements (like in C++, Java, etc.) or not?
[10:35:00] <farkaan> I'm looking it up online and very old sources from StackExchange recommend using it, citing very old ECMA standards
[10:35:19] <farkaan> Other people don't, citing fluff reasons like "JavaScript is meant to be a language accessible to all"
[10:35:38] <farkaan> On the other side people that do recommend using it also have similar inane arguments ("Google uses semicolons")
[10:35:43] <Croran> I'm not aware of a way to code javascript without semicolons
[10:35:55] <Croran> it's definitely the standard
[10:36:26] <farkaan> This course is called FullStackOpen and it does not use them from what I've seen so far.
[10:36:41] <Croran> maybe you're just looking at html and css code so far.
[10:36:49] <farkaan> No it's JavaScript
[10:36:49] <sheetjs> farkaan: do you want a sincere answer?
[10:37:20] <farkaan> Croran I can tell the difference between markup and code lol
[10:37:32] <sheetjs> ASI (automatic semicolon insertion) is a part of the language
[10:37:38] <farkaan> sheetjs: I'm looking at the latest ECMA standard, maybe there's something there
[10:37:39] <sheetjs> not all parts of the language are "good"
[10:37:50] <farkaan> Yeah they're automatically inserted, that's the main reason cited for not using them
[10:38:23] <farkaan> This is the course btw: https://fullstackopen.com/en/ (university of helsinki)
[10:38:46] <sheetjs> there are good reasons to use semicolons and good reasons not to
[10:39:09] <farkaan> sheetjs: Yes, that's what I've gathered so far. var hoisting for example is certainly strange.
[10:39:18] <sheetjs> they are language features
[10:39:28] <Croran> maybe sacrilege on ##javascript but it's really not a good language.
[10:39:29] <Croran> using
[10:39:52] <Croran> using semicolons will set you up for success in future coding efforts
[10:39:55] <sheetjs> javascript is not a great language, but other languages are worse
[10:40:12] <Croran> true. php comes to mind.
[10:40:30] <farkaan> I think it's probably best to stick to statically typed languages like Java for now. I was doing fine at my Android internship (they paid more than webdev) but the college recommends I follow through fullstackopen
[10:41:37] <Croran> well not saying you shouldn't learn it. just saying good opportunity to get used to semicolons.
[10:42:09] <sheetjs> statically typed languages have their own warts
[10:42:13] <farkaan> Yeah I mean webdev is fun, even if the language is a bit strange
[10:42:30] <Croran> javascript is huge in industry

[10:44:08] <farkaan> Going back to the usual cs land would mean grinding algorithms and leetcode quesitons, which is not fun either... I can definitely see the appeal of web development
[10:44:28] <sheetjs> there's plenty of algorithm work in JS land
[10:44:46] <Croran> most coding is super boring and tedious.
[10:44:59] <Croran> if you know your algorithms you might be able to get a job doing something somewhat interesting

[11:33:30] <theskillwithin> npm init; npm i jscs; npm i jshint
[11:33:32] <sheetjs> there's some default behavior where running npm i will rewrite package.json

[11:34:13] <pagios> hi all, so i have a file that has multiple record where each record is 3 lines - for example  record 1 is:    line1: a ,   line2: b , line3: c ,                     record2:  line 4: d , line5: e , line 6: f etc,      i would like to create SQL insert statement for each record, so i need to read 3 lines at a time and create an insert statement, how cn i do that logically?
[11:34:31] <pagios> i need to read 3 lines at a time mainly
[11:34:37] <sheetjs> pagios: where is the file and how are you getting the data?
[11:34:40] <theskillwithin> sheetjs but if you install a package it should be set in package.json....
[11:34:49] <pagios> the file is locally on my nodejs  users.txt
[11:34:51] <sheetjs> the point is not to set it theskillwithin
[11:35:18] <theskillwithin> sheetjs why?
[11:37:35] <sheetjs> pagios: the simplest thing to do is fs.readFileSync("users.txt").split(/\r\n|\n/).reduce((acc,x) => { if(acc.slice(-1).length == 3) acc.push([x]); else acc.slice(-1).push(x); return acc }, [[]])

[14:43:33] <ProfSimm> What if we imagine functions as rows in a database table, where the input and output are just a set of columns. You can query for the row you want by saying WHERE col=val AND ... specifying whichever columns you want, from the input or the output, and you get the rest.

[14:45:27] <Decker> you don't need functions in SQL anyway; though you can have table valued functions that only exist as a function
[14:46:13] <ProfSimm> Decker: sure, I'm saying basically what if we represent calculations themselves as tables. Not materialized, not computed. Just it looks like a table and you query it like one.
[14:46:42] <ProfSimm> For example the "sums" table would have columns op1 op2 result       op1: 10 op2: 20 result: 30
[14:46:52] <ProfSimm> And you can do subtraction if you pass, say, result and op2 and you get back op1
[14:47:27] <Decker> something that's neither materialized nor computed is unqueryable it wouldn't have any deata
[14:47:50] <ProfSimm> An integer multiplication/division table would look like:   op1 op2 mod result     5 * 6 + 2 = 32       (32 - 2) / 6 = 5
[14:48:11] <ProfSimm> Decker: you provide the data from the query and a function

[14:49:42] <Decker> it's called table valued function... but you can `select sin(x)` don't neven need a table then
[14:50:09] <ProfSimm> Decker: the table above op1 op2 mod result actually describes four operations in one  1) integer multiplication 2) integer division 3) integer modulo 3) addition 4) subtraction
[14:50:33] <ProfSimm> It's like sum-product in Excel you can use it for anything ;-)
[14:50:33] <dave0> just do nand
[14:51:02] <Decker> right... it's called table valued function :) It already exists and you can leverage it that way
[14:51:19] <ProfSimm> NAND is interesting, but you'd need multiple queries to emulate other operations. While this example table I'm giving does all operations above in one query
[14:51:22] <Decker> and swap table for some other computation using the same operands

[15:09:46] <ProfSimm> Decker:  I checked out table-valued functions, it's similar, but there's a key difference: the function produces an entire table regardless of input. In my examples, you first need the specific query and then you materialize only the answers to that query.
[15:10:03] <ProfSimm> Decker: because for example otherwise the table of all possible sums/multiplications would be gigantic
[15:10:10] <Decker> that's all the table function has to build also
[15:10:17] <ProfSimm> Decker: oh really
[15:10:35] <Decker> ya it only has to generate output for the input
[15:10:47] <ProfSimm> But how does it see the input
[15:11:36] <ProfSimm> Decker: oh you mean it takes input as arguments. In my case the input is field values
[15:11:49] *** Joins: darkstardevx (~darkstard@50.39.115.145)
[15:12:54] <Decker> well it's in the arguments passed the function; so the syntax is slightly different   'SELECT value FROM generate_series(5,100,5);'
[15:13:01] <ProfSimm> Decker: basically the function in this case has no arguments at all. It's just a table. It doesn't exist until you query it.
[15:13:36] <ProfSimm> Decker: this is key though, so we don't multiply concepts. If everything is a table, we have no concept of "arguments". Just rows and cols
[15:14:04] <Decker> https://sqlite.org/vtab.html sqlite also has virtual tables... which would work with 'SELECT value FROM generate_series WHERE start=5 AND stop=50;'

[20:27:06] <ljharb> scss > sass anyways
[20:27:14] <ljharb> personally i prefer normal css
[20:27:18] <banana_> yeah same thing
[20:27:20] <gkatsev> there's the new module that isn't native `sass`
[20:27:23] <ljharb> not "the coffeescript of css"

[20:27:42] <ljharb> banana_: they are not the same thing
[20:27:47] <gkatsev> it's technically written in dart, I think, but it's compiled to js so, `sass` is pure js

[20:29:14] <banana_> afairc
[20:30:29] <banana_> oh scss is a superset of css
[20:30:38] <banana_> and .sass isnt I guess
[20:30:42] <ljharb> right
[20:30:54] <gkatsev> I mean, the main difference between sass and scss is curly braces
[20:31:10] <banana_> damn well to bad im not motivated enough to find out why that's important
[20:31:48] <banana_> oh .sass requires indents
[20:31:57] *** Joins: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag)
[20:31:59] <ljharb> you should have consistent indentation anyways
[20:32:01] <gkatsev> significant whitespace
[20:32:06] <ljharb> but yeah significant whitespace is dumb
[20:32:15] <banana_> your tabs should be whitespaces right
[20:32:23] <banana_> that's like some editorconfig thing
[20:32:23] <ljharb> like i said, coffeescript
[20:32:36] <ljharb> banana_: personally i suggest everyone use tabs for indentation, not spaces
[20:32:43] <ljharb> banana_: but that's a totally disparate argument
[20:32:50] <banana_> ok cool
[20:32:57] <gkatsev> unless there's something specific that you need sass for, I would recommend postcss instead
[20:33:05] <ljharb> ^
[20:33:06] <banana_> so like if you were my boss youd make me do tabs but if not you dont care
[20:33:09] <gkatsev> you can get like 90% of sass/scss features via postcss plugins
[20:33:10] <banana_> not worth the fight
[20:33:36] <banana_> look man I'm on this project trying to help the most I can
[20:33:52] <ljharb> banana_: i mean, sometimes it's worth the fight :-) it depends
[20:33:52] <banana_> have to dance and play my cards right so they listen to my suggestions
[20:33:57] <banana_> do you use BEM?
[20:34:15] <gkatsev> if you're currently using `node-sass`, you should be able to `sass` and get rid of any build issues and output should be equivalent.
[20:34:17] <banana_> I like BEM because i think it ties into not having to many embedded css classes
[20:34:30] <sambauer64> the following jquery datepicker does not alter the dateFormat https://pastebin.com/uVpFA1UQ
[20:34:51] <sambauer64> any idea why? i want dd.mm.yy and it shows mm.dd.yy
[20:34:55] <banana_> embedded css classes in scss is bad right
[20:35:09] <banana_> thought so, so one thing I'm trying to advocate on my project
[20:36:41] <EdFletcher> sambauer64: That’s a locale thing, this should help https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat
[20:36:44] <ljharb> sambauer64: that's jquery and jquery ui 1, both of which are super ancient
[20:36:50] <ljharb> sambauer64: also, don't ever use jquery plugins
[20:36:56] <banana_> idk if there's a software development term for the strategy I'm using. but basically I build refactoring in pieces. and then reuse those pieces later once I'm given the green light to refactor
[20:37:01] <ljharb> sambauer64: also, Y-M-D is the only good date format
[20:38:00] <sambauer64> ljharb: yes, I want to use Y-M-D for database compatibility. this was just a test. but I cannot seem to know how to modify the format
[20:40:47] <banana_> ljharb: what's that strategy called idk
[20:40:59] <banana_> I'm naming it "the emperor has no clothes"
[20:41:51] <banana_> roll with the bad choices but really build better code and reuse it later
[20:44:38] <ljharb> sambauer64: not sure, but the other comments still apply
[20:44:51] <ljharb> sambauer64: those are 2010-era libraries, and using jquery plugins at all was bad even in 2010
