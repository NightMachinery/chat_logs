[01:34:16] <GuiToris> mdogg, how do you pronounce 'has to' with Z or S?
[01:34:21] <StayHungry> It's just not the first time I've heard questions about how to pronounce something in American. they are surprised to hear the difference in examples from YouTube and dictionaries. but within the United States, not only the pronunciation differs, but everything else (for example, soda/tonic is one drink). 
[01:35:36] <mdogg> GuiToris: I live in California.  Can you give me a sentence with it?
[01:36:07] <GuiToris> Everyone has to wear a seat belt
[01:36:19] <mdogg> StayHungry: And you're right - when I lived in Detroit, you would call a can of Coke a "pop" but in California and New York, it's a can of "soda".
[01:36:34] <furrykef> I pronounce "has to" with /s/
[01:36:52] <GuiToris> thank you, one vote for S :)
[01:36:54] <furrykef> Well, it may depend on how rapid or careless my speech is
[01:37:20] <StayHungry> e.g. you can find the pronunciation of the phrase 'law and public safety' as 'lauren public safety' and that would be okay for someone from New England area, although some dictionary with the so-called. Standard American (GA), i.e. in many ways an artificial linguistic construct, will give a different pronunciation
[01:37:36] <GuiToris> furrykef, do you think it's sloppy speech?
[01:37:56] <GuiToris> mdogg, do you also say it with S?
[01:37:59] <furrykef> Well, not really.
[01:38:08] <mdogg> GuiToris: If I say "Everyone has to wear a seat belt." I seem to pronounce 'has' with an 'S'.  But - if the sentence was "Everybody has to wear a seat belt." I find myself using a 'z' for 'has' for some reason.  
[01:38:48] <GuiToris> hmmm
[01:38:57] <GuiToris> at first I didn't find the difference
[01:39:14] <GuiToris> ok, I think furrykef would also use both
[01:39:30] <GuiToris> I'll practice both pronunciations
[01:39:43] <furrykef> I think it's not worth worrying about, to be honest
[01:39:45] <mdogg> Even now that I'm thinking about it.  If the sentence starts with "Everyone" then I use an S.  But if it starts with "Everybody" I seem to get lazy and use a z to pronounce the S on Has...
[01:40:43] <GuiToris> mdogg, I thought you pronounce the other way around
[01:41:24] <mdogg> The proper was to pronounce it is with the s.  But for some reason my 's' turns more into a 'z' sound if the first word is "Everybody". 
[01:41:44] <mdogg> But I *should* pronounce it with an S sound.
[01:42:14] <furrykef> I don't think "everyone" vs. "everybody" makes a difference to me there.
[01:42:39] <GuiToris> I thought the 'ess' variant would be the good because of the first person 'hafta'
[01:42:51] <GuiToris> hafta -> hasta would make sense
[01:43:08] <GuiToris> I find hazta a little bit more complicated
[01:43:58] <mdogg> No, I don't think that matters much.  To me, it's a sentence like, "That guy has blue hair".   When I say "has" in that sentence it sounds like "haz".

[01:58:15] <mdogg> Has'ta?  That's not the same as "has to", but if it were "has to" then Yes, the "has" sounds correct to me.
[01:59:16] <mdogg> What I mean is, if in that example the man said, "to" instead of "ta", then I would agree he said "Has to" correctly.
[02:00:22] <GuiToris> oh, got it
[02:00:33] <mdogg> "The girl has to go to the store or her mother will be cross."   In that sentence, I would say 'has' with the 's' rather than 'haz'.

[02:11:55] <mdogg> But, if you listen to the pronunciation for "has-been" (both UK and American) it uses the 'z'.  Even the word "has" by itself is /haz/ which emphasizes the "z".  But in "has to", I still contend that it is /has to/

[02:13:02] <StayHungry> before attributing a difference in sound to any accent, you need to check the basics like the influence of letters on each other. for example, while the pronunciation of 'cupboard' between the British and Americans may differ in the presence of the 'r' sound, the absence of 'p' in both is due to assimilation.
[02:13:30] <mdogg> That's another good point.

[02:26:38] <mdogg> Yeah sorry - that's not a good example.  Both the UK and American accents for "has been" on that site are British.

[02:27:32] <GuiToris> then I stop searching for the other button :D

[02:28:39] <mdogg> Nah - usually you can hit the dropdown and do a search for "UK Dictionary" or "US Dictionary" and you would get completely different audio examples.  On 'has been' though, they're both British, though one is female and one is male.
[02:29:02] <GuiToris> do you read IPA?
[02:29:14] <mdogg> But, if you search just for "been" you'll hear the difference between the two.  
[02:29:35] <mdogg> I drink IPA.  =D
[02:29:54] <GuiToris> same difference
[02:30:21] <GuiToris> I think the person read out the first pronunciation
[02:30:33] <GuiToris> it provides two pronuncations
[02:30:39] <GuiToris> something is wrong
[02:30:44] <GuiToris> pronunciations
[02:30:59] <GuiToris> and the first one is 'bean'
[02:31:20] <GuiToris> as if Americans also said it this way
[02:31:48] <GuiToris> what I do like about lexico, that it has english - spanish dictionary
[02:31:53] <mdogg> No, the Americans say /ben/
[02:32:19] <GuiToris> you probably meant bɪn
[02:32:22] <mdogg> Yeah
[02:32:26] <GuiToris> ben is just like the name Ben
[02:32:35] <GuiToris> and hopefully it sounds differently
[02:32:44] <mdogg> Actually, I pronounce the two the same. 
[02:32:55] <GuiToris> did dead?
[02:33:30] <mdogg> I say "ben" for Ben and for "been".  When I say "bin" I mean a wheely bin for garbage.  
[02:34:04] <GuiToris> oh, just the word 'been', I thought every short i vowel
[02:34:08] <GuiToris> got it :)
[02:34:35] <GuiToris> I think I read about a pen-pin merger somewhere
[02:35:18] <mdogg> Nah - for me I would say, "Ben has been my best friend since high school."  And I would use /ben/ when I pronounce both of those words.  If I say "bin" there is a different sound...
[02:35:50] <mdogg> Correct - the difference between pen and pin!
[02:35:51] <mdogg> That's right.

[02:40:06] <StayHungry> GuiToris: i'd recommend taking *several* variants of pronunciation with live context from Collins and Youglish instead of an isolated 'has to/been' phrase. that way, you'll be less afraid of not repeating something one-to-one. your goal should be developing a willingness to be clear and understood. then you can tweak an accent, as actors do in drama schools. therefore, first learn to pronounce the word 'often' in any way, but clear, 
[02:40:06] <StayHungry> and later you will choose what is closer to you / ofn / or / oftan / or anything else.

[02:47:19] <mdogg> Well, there is a proper way of speaking English.  Some people say, "There ain't no proper way of speaking so long as folks ain't got no problem."  But that just isn't the case.
[02:47:50] <StayHungry> 'mergerers' are optional, speech intelligibility is important first, otherwise you might learn a fusion accepted somewhere and then hear 'what?' where it is not accepted. I gave an example above: 'law and public safety' might sound like 'lauren public safety', but first it is better to learn to pronounce that as 'law and public safety'.
[02:48:07] <GuiToris> LjL, Svenska?
[02:48:19] <LjL> yes, it's a song
[02:48:29] <GuiToris> I'll look it up
[02:48:48] <GuiToris> I've never heard of it, just asked Google what language it was
[02:48:59] <LjL> the song is Boten Anna, it's about IRC, that's the first verse, and the singer was mocked for saying "bot" like "båt" (meaning boat)
[02:49:42] <GuiToris> basshunter?
[02:49:43] <mdogg> Mocked by whom?
[02:50:34] <LjL> GuiToris, yes
[02:50:35] <mdogg> I only mock people who speak so badly that they need subtitles.
[02:50:48] <LjL> mdogg, by people who covered his song changing the lyrics into ones about boats, for instance
[02:51:02] <mdogg> Oh, well I don't know anything about tath.
[02:51:57] <GuiToris> I never liked basshunter, but it does bring back some memories
[02:52:43] <mdogg> There are people in California who speak so crappy that I really do need someone to translate for me.  Kind of a bastardized version of the language.  It really has nothing to do with where they live, just how they speak.
[02:52:55] <StayHungry> mdogg: are you glad you left Detroit? :)
[02:53:15] <GuiToris> mdogg, aren't they spanish speakers?
[02:53:40] <mdogg> StayHungry: Actually, it was kind of cool living there, but I'm glad I left because I've never experienced such cold winters in my life.
[02:54:23] <mdogg> GuiToris: No, actually they aren't.  They're wanna-be rappers.
[02:54:29] <mdogg> Wanna be gansters.
[02:54:42] <StayHungry> mdogg: how cold?
[02:54:47] <GuiToris> oh gangsta
[02:55:37] <GuiToris> they must have been chosen by the thug life
[02:56:06] <mdogg> StayHungry: lol - let's put it this way.  I can go to Lake Tahoe at ANY point during the winter and have a great time.  When I lived in Detroit though, the wind would blow right threw me to the point where I thought my bones would freeze and break.  
[02:56:53] <StayHungry> mdogg: -4°F ?
[02:57:19] <mdogg> StayHungry: It snows in Lake Tahoe every winter.  But when I lived in Detroit, my bones would freeze no matter what I I put on..  heh
[02:57:59] <mdogg> Not to mention, I don't have to live in the snow.  I don't like driving in the snow...
[02:59:08] <StayHungry> hmm, Google says winter weather averages for Detroit are around 22 F
[02:59:57] <GuiToris> it's about time I left, thank you very much for your help
[03:00:00] <GuiToris> see you later :)

[03:00:48] <mdogg> Well, whatever it averages, winter in Detroit sucks.
[03:01:35] <mdogg> 22F in Lake Tahoe is nothing like 22F in Detroit.
[03:01:55] <mdogg> Maybe it's because I don't live in Tahoe.. heh
[03:04:23] <twb> I didn't know MacOS even had a Detroit release

[06:26:46] <hackinghorn> I'm thinking, every month of the year has a name, every day of the week has a name, why not every week of the month? every hour of the day? every minute of the hour? they dont have names?
[06:27:43] <LjL> days of the week mostly have numbers in greek
[06:28:06] <LjL> and months mostly have numbers in japanese
[06:28:22] <LjL> but that's because they're kind of a foreign import
[06:28:51] <LjL> all in all, names were given to things that were meaningful to people in themselves, either because they were long, or because of some other hallmark like dusk, dawn
[06:29:19] <LjL> if you have 60 of the same thing inside a minute, who cares about giving them a name? and that's aside from the fact that minutes and seconds weren't used by common people until relatively recently
[06:29:33] <LjL> hours also didn't work the way we're used to, before clocks became common
[06:29:48] <hackinghorn> ah, that makes sense eh
[06:30:12] <hackinghorn> oh, hours have names in Chinese, its fun
[06:30:14] <LjL> months tend to have names of either things that happen in nature during that month, or related to deities that were in turn related to that months in some civilization (for english months, usually romans)
[06:30:51] <hackinghorn> ah, I see
[06:31:45] <LjL> you can see remnants of "month numerals", before they gave them all names based on something, in september, october, november, and december
[06:31:58] <LjL> the words for the numbers 7 to 10 in Latin are septem, octo, novem, and decem
[06:32:20] <LjL> the reason it only goes to 10 and not 12 is that months that didn't originally exist were introduced
[06:32:22] <hackinghorn> wow, interesting
[06:32:47] <hackinghorn> so there were only 10 months?
[06:32:55] <hackinghorn> right?
[06:33:09] <hackinghorn> then some months got introduced
[06:33:21] <hackinghorn> and the line got messed up
[06:33:30] <LjL> i think so, but i don't have an exact memory of this, but yeah i think january and february were added later
[06:33:55] <Maxdamantus> Julius Caesar messed things up, as usual.
[06:34:08] <LjL> also, July and August are named in honor of Julius (Cesar) and Augustus. before their time, they were called Quintilis and Sextilis, which basically just mean fifth and sixth
[06:34:20] <Maxdamantus> Sticking two months at the beginning.
[06:34:20] <LjL> then came september and the others, so at least 5 to 10 were still all numbers
[06:34:58] <LjL> i'm not positive Cesar did it, although he certainly messed with leap years
[06:35:46] <LjL> there used to be "non-standard" months, or days added to months, when the formal year was no longer "in sync" with the actual seasons, and this was decided and declared by uh... some magistrates/priests, don't remember which ones

[16:26:53] <twb> huf is right that it sounds much better after the "in"
[16:27:25] <twb> there is (was?) an idiolect called "valley girl" where, stereotypically, every other word is "like"
[16:27:45] <twb> "Like, omigod, math is like so hard, let's like go like shopping"
[16:28:15] <huf> there are also the people who put the like at the end
[16:28:47] <twb> that feels more... west country?
[16:28:48] <StayHungry> twb: in, like, a decade -> not necessary a placeholder, but an approximate value instead of exact as well
[16:29:07] <twb> StayHungry: I would agree if it was after "in"
[16:29:17] <twb> StayHungry: in the original, I'm not sure

That's just my opinion, though, and I have only been on a handful of other networks.  But there are some channels that are kind of lame.  Not that the people are jerks or anything like that, though.

[23:04:55] <Samian> Is it incorrect to use "got" in "He just got banned."
[23:05:14] <Samian> "Trump's twitter account just got permanently banned."
[23:05:24] <Samian> technically "got" means to have received something.
[23:05:34] <Samian> "I just got your email."
[23:05:46] <pussipupu> no
[23:05:52] <Samian> no what?
[23:05:52] <pussipupu> As in no it's not incorrect
[23:05:58] <Samian> ahhh got it
[23:06:04] <Samian> "was" sounds more formal
[23:06:18] <Samian> "He was just now banned."
[23:06:39] <Samian> "He was permanently banned from the platform." 
[23:06:43] <Samian> "He got permanently banned from the platform." 
[23:06:53] <Samian> doesn't "got" sound more slang-like ?
[23:06:53] <pussipupu> "just now banned" is a bit odd
[23:07:09] <pussipupu> Not to me I think
[23:07:37] <Samian> pussipupu  without "now" in "just now banned", the word "just" would qualify the word "banned" instead of qualifying when it happened
[23:08:10] <Samian> "He was just banned" means nothing else happened to him except that he was banned. He wasn't killed. He wasn't prosecuted in court. He was just banned.
[23:08:16] <mdogg> I would say "He was permanently banned form the platform."  Using 'got' in that sentence does not sound correct to me.
[23:08:29] <mdogg> from*
[23:08:31] <morteza24> mdogg I haven't been on so many networks either; I've only been on freenode and libera. Are there other networks that are as active and popular as libera? I've always thought that IRC is almost forgotten and freenode (and now libera) are the only networks keeping it alive
[23:08:34] <pussipupu> no it can mean both the "only" and the temporal meaning
[23:09:35] <Samian> pussipupu  ever read about misplaced modifiers? 
[23:09:55] <Samian> "only" is the most pernicious and widespread misplaced modifier an article I read once said
[23:09:56] <mdogg> Samian: I agree with you - in most of your examples I would not use the word 'got'.
[23:10:03] <Samian> thanks mdogg !
[23:10:16] <pussipupu> You're welcome not to like it
[23:10:39] <mdogg> "She got a pimple on her face."  "She has a pimple on her face."  The second sentence is correct.

[23:18:34] <fentanyl> How can I write this in better way?
[23:18:37] <fentanyl> Consistent hashing was designed to avoid the problem of having to reassign every BLOBs on every server when a server is added or removed.
[23:18:57] <fentanyl> Like, I don't like using "on every server when a server"
[23:19:11] <fentanyl> Like, 'server' multiple times.
[23:19:21] <fentanyl> looks amature. 
[23:19:29] <fentanyl> Can someone suggest an alternative?
[23:19:31] <tinwhiskers> BLOB should be singular? Otherwise it's ok to me.
[23:19:56] <fentanyl> Ah, I think BLOBs is correct way to put it since there are more than one BLOB.
[23:19:59] <OMGOMG_> fentanyl: "every server" vs "a server", it doesn't look odd
[23:20:04] <tinwhiskers> no.
[23:20:22] <fentanyl> tinwhiskers: maybe i'm mistaken, I don't know.
[23:20:31] <Samian> fentanyl looks good to me. Just change BLOBs to BLOB
[23:21:07] <fentanyl> Samian: Hmm, I didn't understand the part where BLOBs is replaced with BLOB.
[23:21:10] <Samian> fentanyl  maybe I'd change "having" to "needing". It's personal preference.
[23:21:35] <tinwhiskers> every stone is grey. All stones are grey. - you don't pluralise every.
[23:21:37] <fentanyl> Since there are multiple BLOB(s) on every server and more when combining all the servers.
[23:21:46] <Samian> fentanyl  A BLOB in computer lingo is a "Binary Large Object"
[23:21:51] <fentanyl> Yeha
[23:21:59] <Samian> fentanyl but you said "every"
[23:22:22] <Samian> "I ate every apple on the table."  I don't say "I ate every apples on the table."
[23:22:25] <fentanyl> Ah, that "every" makes it plural?
[23:22:31] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[23:22:32] <fentanyl> yeah, makes sense.
[23:22:34] <mdogg> fentanyl: How about, "Consistent hashing was designed to avoid the problem of having to redesign every BLOB when a server is added or removed on a global level throughout the network."
[23:22:34] <fentanyl> thanks.
[23:22:44] <Samian> in a way it does. Think of "every" as a for loop over a single items.

[23:22:59] <Samian> I drove every car in my garage.
[23:23:03] <fentanyl> I'll use that.
[23:23:49] <fentanyl> mdogg: not sure why we'd need "global level" though.
[23:24:07] <mdogg> You don't, actually.  Throughout the network does mean "globally".
[23:24:15] <fentanyl> I see.
[23:25:00] <fentanyl> I think cluster is a better word for network, since collection of servers is better called as a cluster.
[23:25:16] <fentanyl> But doesn't matter, it's not English topic anyway.
[23:25:28] <fentanyl> Thanks guys!
[23:25:42] <mdogg> Glad we could help.
[23:27:16] <mdogg> Well, libera.chat is this network, and there are Matrix users who connect to this network from various servers.  But yeah, you can use cluster, too.  Or domain..
[23:28:08] <mdogg> That's something that you can decide, though, depending on the rest of what you're writing.

[23:28:52] <fentanyl> It's called Libera Network because we're all connected as "nodes" and we don't "serve" any date to clients. We join, talk and exit. But in the case of servers, they "serve" stuff to "clients".
[23:29:29] <LjL> it's called Libera because they were in a pinch and didn't know what to call it and that's what someone came up with
[23:29:33] <mdogg> Ah, ok.  I see where you're going.  That makes sense.
[23:30:57] <pussipupu> Libera runs (or has run on their behalf) a network-wide Matrix bridge incidentally
[23:31:10] <pussipupu> So the integration is smoother than in the Freenode days
[23:31:37] <fentanyl> Cool people are tolerance of my English mistakes and fix them on my edits. But I gotta write good English on the articles.
[23:31:54] <GuiToris> Hello, I've just read that the phrasal verb 'look after' is chiefly British. Is this true? Are these sentences way too British? https://bpa.st/raw/ZXMA
[23:32:16] <pussipupu> *tolerant
[23:32:29] <fentanyl> I'm that one sad, lonely, single Wikipedia editor. 
[23:32:55] <fentanyl> pussipupu: ah, yeah. copy paste mistakes.
[23:33:24] <pussipupu> I keep meaning to become a Wikipedia editor but I'm not sure the politics is worth it
[23:35:03] <mdogg> GuiToris: There isn't anything wrong with any of those sentences, but you are correct - they do sound British.  In America, we would say, "My girlfriend wants me to watch (or take care of) her son twice a week."  "We are to take care of my neighbor's dog while he is away..."  The last sentence, in America, we would say, "My sister is still very sick and our parents are taking care of her."
[23:35:12] <fentanyl> politics? you wanna edit controversial articles, pussipupu ?
[23:35:55] <GuiToris> mdogg, do I just s/look after/take care of/ and I'm good to go? Can I go wrong?
[23:35:58] <pussipupu> No, it just looks like a very politics laden culture from my perspective
[23:36:15] <pussipupu> maybe I'm just paranoid and lazy :p
[23:36:29] <fentanyl> If you do wanna edit controversial sections, you gotta be on the Left-wing to make sure your edits don't get reverted.
[23:36:44] <StayHungry> mdogg: 'She got a pimple on her face. / She has a pimple on her face. / The second sentence is correct.' Both are correct. The first emphasizes the obtaining (e.g. 'I got my hair cut'), the second merely states the presence.
[23:36:56] <fentanyl> and some admin comes in and imposes a block.
[23:36:58] <pussipupu> suuure
[23:38:11] <fentanyl> It's a *proven* fact through scholarly discourse that Wikipedia has left-wing bias on controversial articles, btw. Lemme find that link, hold on.
[23:38:46] <mdogg> StayHungry: Except in your last example, "I got my hair cut."  That means you received it which is what got generally means.  "He got an STD after sleeping with Jessica."  That is correct, too.  The exception might be in this example:  "She got away with the murder of her husband."  She didn't receive that, but it is proper English.

[23:40:51] <mdogg> GuiToris: In America, we would probably say, "I need to watch my neighbors kid for a few hours when he gets home from school." rather than using "take care of" in that example.  To "take care of" something implies a longer-term commitment.  Like taking care of a house while someone is away on holiday, or taking care of their dog while they are out of town.
[23:41:17] <GuiToris> got it, thank you mdogg :)
[23:42:05] <mdogg> That said, though - if an American used "look after" in any of those examples, I doubt anybody would think it sounded odd.
[23:42:24] <mdogg> But it is more of a British way of speaking, I reckon..
[23:43:05] <fentanyl> interesting.
[23:45:12] <GuiToris> mdogg, maybe there's one more thing to ask. Do you use 'having' as 'because' and 'after'. Examples: Having a big house, he often throws parties. (because) Having finished the project, we started another (after)
[23:45:59] <StayHungry> -_- it's just a gerund
[23:47:00] <mdogg> I think most people in America would change those around to, "He has a big house and throws a lot of parties."  Your first example implies that he only throws parties because his house is big.
[23:48:05] <mdogg> In the second example I would say, "We started the second part of the project since we finished the first part."   
[23:48:58] <GuiToris> ok, so you would never say them that way
