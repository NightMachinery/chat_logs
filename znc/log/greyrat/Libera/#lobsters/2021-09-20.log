[00:44:32] <manicennui> Yes please.
[00:44:52] <manicennui> I wonder whether it is feasible to enable a feature like that for a large network.
[00:45:26] <manicennui> It doesn't mention a setting to eventually timeout a client.
[00:45:39] <manicennui> Like if they don't connect for a month, maybe the resources should be freed up.
[00:46:30] <manicennui> I guess that other chat protocols like Slack work like this, but they have pretty serious limitations on connections.
[00:47:30] <companion_cube> You can share most logs among clients
[00:47:38] <manicennui> If designed well, I guess you wouldn't need to keep more than one copy of any channel, and just record that the client is in the channel.

[00:47:41] <manicennui> Yeah.

[06:02:17] <gwozniak> We compile our stdlibs with -ffunction-sections and -fdata-sections so you can pass --gc-sections to the linker to trim the stuff you don't need.  Makes replacing a stdlib function a little easier.

[06:03:19] <gwozniak> Usually stdlib stuff is written to be pretty integrated.  The way headers are split doesn't help
[06:04:10] <gwozniak> Newlib has all those thread safe versions of everything, and under the hood they all share this global state to be able to do it

[06:06:04] <JordiGH> Maybe I'm just not applying at jobs that do that anymore.
[06:06:08] <JordiGH> I haven't been whiteboarded in a lnog time.

[06:14:36] <JordiGH> 6. Conclusion
[06:14:36] <JordiGH> In this tutorial, we showed a sample circular linked list. Also, we discussed two linear-time algorithms that can check if a linked list is a circular linked list.
[06:14:36] <JordiGH> Comments are closed on this article!
[06:16:24] <drobilla> Hm, not sure I can prove that's O(n) off the top of my head
[06:16:55] <JordiGH> You only have to loop at most 2n size of the list.
[06:16:58] <JordiGH> 2n = O(n)
[06:17:46] <drobilla> Why 2 though?  It seems like they could do a few "laps" before actually meeting
[06:18:06] <drobilla> Oh.  You check if one /passes/ the other, of course
[06:18:37] <drobilla> I don't know what the complexity of the stupid "jump the hare over the tortoise and don't notice" version would be.  It gets numberey
[06:19:51] <JordiGH> That doesn't happen.
[06:19:53] <JordiGH> Both move.
[06:20:06] <JordiGH> The hare can't jump over the tortoise.
[06:20:12] <JordiGH> Their distance always goes down by 1.
[06:20:17] <JordiGH> 2 - 1 = 1
[06:21:27] <JordiGH> Also, I'm wrong, it's not 2n in the worse case.
[06:22:02] <JordiGH> The worst case is when the whole thing is a cycle, in which case you just go through the whole list and fast catches up to slow in n steps.
[06:22:13] <drobilla> It's Sunday night and I'm baked, the threshold for "numberey" is pretty low, what can I say? :)
[06:22:24] <YellowSuB> Surely it would be n right, start at the head, iterate until head is found again?
[06:22:38] <JordiGH> YellowSuB: How do you know you're at head again?
[06:22:48] <YellowSuB> Pointer comparison?
[06:22:59] <YellowSuB> Oh, I guess that doesnt work in pseudocode
[06:23:13] <JordiGH> Y'know, after having been asked this question thrice in my life, I should know it by heart by now.
[06:24:12] <YellowSuB> Unless you could mark the head somehow, similarly to how some graph algorithm solutions are presented
[06:24:24] <JordiGH> You might never come back to the head.
[06:24:37] <JordiGH> Because the loop could happen later in the list.
[06:24:46] <JordiGH> The list looks like a p.
[06:24:47] <YellowSuB> Right, that's the point, only if you find the head is the list circular, otherwise non-circular
[06:25:03] <JordiGH> No, there might be a cycle, but it doesn't have to start at the head.
[06:25:11] <YellowSuB> Ah, I see your point,
[06:25:22] <drobilla> Yeah that's the usual graph one
[06:25:28] <YellowSuB> Yeah I was thinking the list too simply,
[06:25:39] <YellowSuB> So any node could lead to a loop
[06:26:14] <YellowSuB> surely something similar to the graph algorithm ones could be used, where the visited nodes are marked, if found again it is circular
[06:26:27] <drobilla> Yeah, but you need "extra storage" for that
[06:26:28] <JordiGH> That uses too much memory.
[06:26:32] <YellowSuB> Wouldn't that give us something like O(n)
[06:26:39] <JordiGH> In memory, yes.
[06:26:43] <JordiGH> But we want O(1) in memory.
[06:26:44] <YellowSuB> what
[06:26:47] <YellowSuB> Ahh
[06:26:58] <drobilla> In graph land you can't really do much at all without even the ability to mark nodes, so that constraint would be... rather extremely synthetic there
[06:27:06] <JordiGH> It's not a real problem, it's just something to whiteboard people with.

[09:35:52] <pnoud> python, obviously.
[09:38:40] <usrme> I was originally taught Java in college and it was just a mess to understand why on Earth all of that "public void" etc. nonsense was required to create a simple "read input, react based off of that" program
[09:39:55] <usrme> I feel that if someone really proficient (not just a scripting level) had taught us Python, then that would have proven to be far more useful and enlightening
[09:40:06] <HappyMan> python has its share of pitfalls, though
[09:40:27] <usrme> oh, for sure, but as a true beginner should you care at that point?

[09:41:11] <usrme> if the goal is to encourage people to get their feet wet and not against their will, then at least on my own experience Java is not the way to go
[09:41:11] <HappyMan> perhaps not
[09:41:20] <HappyMan> no, java is a bit too ceremonial, i agree
[09:41:34] <HappyMan> i've personally witnessed  many people get tripped up by indentation issues in python, however
[09:41:47] <usrme> exactly, all that rigamarole (there's a word you don't see often) in Java just to run something
[09:41:56] <usrme> yeah, agreed
[09:42:20] <HappyMan> i'm not sure there is a "good" language to start out with, honestly
[09:42:24] <drobilla> SICP
[09:42:57] <usrme> HappyMan, perhaps it all down to the teacher, the methodology, the practice problems, etc.
[09:43:58] <HappyMan> ehhhhhhhh, i think lisps do more harm than good in the current zeitgest, drobilla. because they look so different from all the most common languages it's harder for the student to build up parallels
[09:44:22] <HappyMan> usrme, absolutely, a good teacher and a good curriculum together easily make it so that language choice is immaterial

[09:45:49] <drobilla> I mean, yeah, I get it, but in the context of university education anyway, I figure one course in a language family you may never use is nothing.

[09:46:19] <HappyMan> python's a fantastic language, don't get me wrong
[09:46:44] <HappyMan> it's a great choice to start off with, especially because so much beginner-level content uses it
[09:46:57] <usrme> but...
[09:47:05] <manicennui> If you can't see how features from lisps are relevant, I don't know that I'd want you on my team.
[09:47:13] <HappyMan> but... you can't use it to teach things like memory management
[09:47:28] <manicennui> People shouldn't be doing memory management, and few of us do.
[09:47:29] <HappyMan> and depending on the interests of the student there are domains where python is just never gonna happen (arduino)
[09:47:50] <usrme> what if the context in which you're in doesn't require you to know about memory management?
[09:47:53] <pnoud> The joke in calling code beginner level is the implication that there is a level after that.

[09:54:10] <usrme> it's obviously Bash
[09:54:52] <imode> for real though, it depends on the context. if your intent is to introduce your students to languages focused on a machine model, teach "low level" ones. if your intent is to teach higher level software organization, teach a higher level one.

[09:58:12] <imode> I have a feeling the "low level" is more fundamental, but I don't think a concrete assembly language or similarly-veined language will do.
[09:58:27] <drobilla> Not so extreme in reality, of course, but the obvious answer to "teach high or low level languages" for any even slightly broad education is "both", so might as well lean into it

[10:09:12] <HappyMan> yeah tuition is bonkers
[10:09:16] <bkero> Yes, I know. I paid nuts tuition as well.
[10:09:25] <bkero> Out of state, graduated back in 2008, was about $10k/year.
[10:09:29] <imode> which nut did you pay them in tho.
[10:09:35] <bkero> My understanding is that it's gone up around 15-35%
[10:09:40] <imode> acorns?
[10:09:43] <HappyMan> man, my out of state tuition in 2010 was $33k
[10:09:50] <bkero> I went to a state university
[10:09:57] <HappyMan> so did i
[10:09:59] <pnoud> 10,000 acorns, or 50,000 cashews
[10:10:13] <HappyMan> why are cashews so cheap
[10:10:15] <bkero> I for one recognize that my experience is not data. It's an anecdote.

[10:11:19] <imode> casheeeeeeeews

[10:11:38] <bkero> Twice a month
[10:11:49] <imode> really glad I live in a state with no state income tax.
[10:12:00] <bkero> That amounts to about a 10% raise usually
[10:12:09] <pnoud> Do FAANG employees still think in paychecks?
[10:12:10] <bkero> Usually they get you in other ways like property tax
[10:12:15] <imode> pnoud: yup.
[10:12:25] <pnoud> Certainly the metric is RSU grants.
[10:12:26] <imode> bkero: awww yeah they do.

He is supposing that if you don't have any (invariants that is), then one is better off with data classes
[10:28:25] <HappyMan> that's a bit prescriptive... classes are flexible enough to fill multiple roles
[10:28:32] <usrme> is there a consensus around this outside the author's view of the world as well?
[10:29:27] <usrme> HappyMan, same here, after reading that and looking at my own classes I noticed that I do not have an invariant that I want to explicitly preserve so I am considering whether or not I made the right choice vs. a data class
[10:30:25] <HappyMan> i think it depends on how the language is designed. a language like rust asks that you preserve invariants differently than a language like python, for example

[10:47:23] *** Quits: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[10:48:13] <manicennui> I didn't realize that Rust allowed public data structures with private members and methods that could act on those private members.
[10:48:20] <manicennui> So it has enough to deal with this.
[10:48:46] *** Joins: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav)
[10:49:00] <manicennui> usrme: Take a look at those two links, although they might be hard to understand if you don't know either language at all.
[10:49:25] <manicennui> usrme: Basically it boils down to whether you want code to be able to update data directly  or protect it behind some methods.
[10:49:56] <manicennui> Arguably this is one of the few useful features from the OO world.
[10:50:10] <iDrougge> And not, as in Java, have methods that are just getA() { return this.a }.
[10:50:36] <manicennui> iDrougge: Regardless of whether Java is elegant, it also solves this problem.
[10:51:14] <manicennui> iDrougge: You wouldn't do anything differently in Rust if you wanted to keep the members private but provide access methods to them.
[10:51:27] <iDrougge> If all your getter/setter does is get/set, it's superfluous.
[10:51:40] <manicennui> Sure.
[10:52:24] <usrme> manicennui, so if I'm not updating locally known data, per se, and just grouping together existing data and behavior (e.g. creating resources in the cloud) for calling conveniences then a data class is a better choice? =#
[10:52:56] <usrme> really wearing the dumb on my sleeve here
[10:53:08] <manicennui> usrme: Consider a Contact class.
[10:53:29] <manicennui> And let's say you have an attribute EmailAddress. (using camel case so it stands out, don't want to argue about it)
[10:53:58] <manicennui> You could make EmailAddress's type String.
[10:54:25] <manicennui> Now if you let code update it directly, you might set it to something that isn't an email address.
[10:54:51] <manicennui> So you make it private, and create a method to update it that validates that the input is an email address, and returns an error/throws an exception otherwise.

[10:55:09] <manicennui> This is a good thing to do even if just gathering data to send to an API.
[10:55:17] <manicennui> Better to know before you send it that it is invalid.
[10:57:06] <usrme> at the moment I'm just fetching a few arguments (where to create the resource, for example), which is then validated prior to instantiating the object, and then I'm using that data to create the resource in the cloud through a method on the object
[10:57:13] <usrme> worth mentioning that I'm working on a CLI tool
[10:58:26] <manicennui> usrme: I mean, I'm not going to insist that you create rock solid code all the time, but it is often better to prevent the possibility of invalid states than to rely on calling code to do things correctly.
[10:58:27] <usrme> e.g. "my-cli-tool.py --location europe" -> validate parameter "location" -> resource = Resource(location) -> within Resource() initialize attributes and execute "create" method after initialization

[10:59:27] <HappyMan> > First, the business logic is complicated. There is no easy way to avoid it. If your code is not this complicated, you are not handling all the cases properly.
[10:59:27] <HappyMan> I really love this line
[10:59:39] <manicennui> Having separate validation code that you call is better than nothing, but when developing software on a team, you can rely on everyone to do the right thing.
[10:59:55] <manicennui> can't

[11:00:17] <HappyMan> just the bluntness of it, "yes, your problem is complicated, please accept that fact"
[11:01:45] <usrme> thanks for the input! appreciate it
[11:02:20] <usrme> I'm not working with professional software developers, so I'm really having to learn everything by going through the pains myself
[11:02:28] <usrme> mistakes abound!
[11:03:19] <HappyMan> gets worse when you have to deal with others. one of the great joys of programming is that you can perfectly express your thoughts in a way that others can use. problem is everybody thinks differently
[11:03:40] <HappyMan> and so when you ask more than one person to write a program, it's basically the same as asking them to mind-meld
[11:03:53] <HappyMan> functionally impossible, but because we're all engineers, we hack around the issue
[11:04:27] <HappyMan> i'm just ruminating out loud now
[11:05:11] <epilys> in my first group project (subject was "Soft Engineering and practices") in university I had to teach 6 other people to write code
[11:05:24] <manicennui> Group projects in school are dumb.
[11:05:37] <epilys> their version of writing code was "write C in one go, then try to compile, and fix bug by bug"
[11:05:58] <HappyMan> oh dear
[11:06:00] <manicennui> Hey, that's how I write code now!
[11:06:07] <manicennui> But my code usually mostly works on the first try.
[11:06:15] <HappyMan> you don't obsessively compile after every line?
[11:06:19] <HappyMan> pshhh amateurs
[11:06:20] <epilys> manicennui, big difference
[11:06:23] <manicennui> I don't use a compiled language.

[19:10:59] <kline> Brekkjern, the previous post in the art cat was "Moire no more" which is about how to deal with interference patterns in data
