[11:04:05] <wasamasa> it seems that no matter this channel's stance, cryptographers do get involved in blockchain stuff

[11:08:20] <wasamasa> cryptographers go where the money flows
[11:08:27] <wasamasa> because they need to eat and stuff
[11:15:09] <ms7821> the topic here isn't "touching cryptocurrency will get you ostracised" (although you could make that case), but "this isn't a channel to pump your favourite cryptos"
[11:16:32] <ms7821> blockchain and why it's almost never the right solution is totally part of cryptography theory and practice
[11:25:28] <mats1> its really too bad otps aren't commonly used for comms these days

[11:31:17] <n00b101> Get guys
[11:31:43] <n00b101> I use GoDaddy mail forwarding service which if someone send a mail to me@mysite.com then it'll come to my gmail inbox. when I see the security information, I see it's from bounce.secureserver.net - this is signed by Gmail. I hope the forwarding service can see the email.  since it's signed by Gmail, I guess the forwarding service can't change the content of the mail since gmail signed it? 
[11:31:56] <n00b101> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/V5dNh9JS/screenshot.jpg
[11:32:14] <n00b101>  If gmail sign it, can someone modify it? Yes, but I guess they can't sign it
[11:34:37] <wasamasa> signing doesn't prevent someone from changing contents, it prevents the signature for that changed content being valid
[11:34:53] <wasamasa> so you need to validate the signature to tell whether there have been modifications

[11:43:54] <n00b101> My gmail sign the mail, now can mailforwarder modify can sign it with gmail? 
[11:44:07] <n00b101> No. That means, they can't modify the mail?
[11:45:31] <wasamasa> if modification of a signed email happens, then I'd expect the signature to be highlighted as invalid
[11:45:49] <wasamasa> again, signing doesn't prevent modification, it enables tamper detection
[11:46:33] <wasamasa> like, think of these fancy seals on product boxes that must be broken to mess with the box contents
[11:46:49] <wasamasa> you can detect that someone opened the box by inspecting the seal
[11:47:32] <n00b101> But, I guess they can't resign with gmail
[11:47:46] <n00b101> My friend see it's signed by Gmail itself
[11:48:09] <wasamasa> no, the remailer doesn't have gmail's private keys for signing
[11:48:36] <n00b101> They haven't modified it
[11:49:06] <n00b101> But, they read it. Because I saw their logs
[11:49:28] <wasamasa> signing doesn't prevent anyone from reading the contents, lol
[11:49:36] <n00b101> Yes
[11:49:48] <n00b101> I mean, they can't put any ads in my mail
[11:51:17] <wasamasa> the use of email signing is very specific
[11:51:26] <wasamasa> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail
[11:51:49] <wasamasa> gmail uses it to filter out spam
[11:52:42] <wasamasa> they only care about modifying the email address fields
[11:52:56] <n00b101> Lol
[11:53:47] <wasamasa> if you want to prove that the email contents haven't been modified, use s/mime or pgp
[11:54:09] <n00b101> Gmail doesn't support PGP
[11:54:20] <n00b101> I have to manually encrypt?

[11:54:22] <wasamasa> yes
[11:54:33] <n00b101> Hmm
[11:54:56] <n00b101> I need the recipient's PGP jey as well

[23:43:49] <dez> thinking of setting up a gaming website
[23:44:15] <dez> and accepting both crypto and credit cards
[23:44:25] <dez> any idea how to process it?
[23:49:24] <wasamasa> wrong channel for that
[23:49:47] <wasamasa> we talk about cryptography, not enabling libertarians
[23:59:11] <dez> oh sorry
