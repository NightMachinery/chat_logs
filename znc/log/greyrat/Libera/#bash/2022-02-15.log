[01:13:47] <chronon> In what sense is ssh host "$(printf 'rm %q' "$file")" a GOOD thing to do? It doesn't look any better than ssh host "rm $file".
[01:14:18] <chronon> Both are safe at this side, but unsafe on the remote side of the ssh connection.
[01:14:46] <greycat> printf %q is older than ${foo@Q}, so it was what the factoid author had to use at the time it was written

[01:15:06] <chronon> Oh, maybe the %q is sufficiently magic. I didn't sopt that.
[01:15:11] <greycat> the encoding is safe as long as the remote user's shell is bash, not sh, since it may use $'...' quoting
[01:15:37] <chronon> Ok.
[01:15:53] <chronon> Good tip.
[01:16:02] <greycat> I'm not convinced that this particular example is the best one for a factoid intoducing the *concept* of code injection, though

[01:29:18] <chronon> Oh this was a loooong time ago. I vaguely recall the colon being mapped to space in some context, but cannot remember the details now.
[01:30:41] <chronon> I think it was a system of subcommands. ie commands that took keywords as their first few args, and then these were mapped to the function names with colons.

[04:03:44] <sybariten> So anyhow. OK I've been yappin' about this before and had suggestions, but i have forgotten, obviously. What is a good methodology if i want to keep a bash history at some place like bitbucket?  More specifically, if the aim is to A) be able to pull up this history into the bash session of a new and fresh machine, and B) be able to add _selected_ command lines to this history that will eventually be
[04:03:46] <sybariten> commited back to bitbucket. Any ideas?

[04:05:17] <sybariten> I feel like just adding all the bash history back into the git repo, without any sort of cleaning or rinsing, might get out of hands eventually. Hence the idea to do something like "bookmakrs" of certain command lines i know i will need again and that are long or complex
[04:05:31] <greycat> well, you can keep a text file on a web site, and edit it by hand, so that covers B and half of A

However, lets say i "miss" doing this directly after i executed said glorious command. I can flip back through older commands with cursor. Theres nothing i can do function-wise from that view is there, to get ahold of what i'm looking at? (Without manual copying and pasting)

[15:25:19] <Lebela> I need to copy files, and rsync gets stuck
[15:25:40] <Lebela> "sending incremental file list"  <== takes multiple hours
[15:25:52] <Lebela> I asked over in #rsync but to no avail
[15:26:05] <Soliton> how many files do you try to sync?
[15:26:16] <tarzeau> find | wc -l
[15:26:19] <Lebela> roughly 30 videos
[15:26:27] <geirha> does it work if you try to rsync a single, small file to the same host?
[15:26:52] <Lebela> Yes, geirha, but even then it takes ~4-5 minutes to get behind this stage

[15:30:38] <grawity> I would suggest trying mtpfs instead of gphotofs
[15:30:45] <grawity> or jmtpfs, whichever
[15:30:57] *** Joins: vishal (~vishal@fedora/vishal)
[15:31:06] <Lebela> grawity, sorry for asking, but please tell me why?
[15:31:19] <Lebela> grawity, I am not questioning your knowledge, I am just eager to learn
[15:31:20] <grawity> literally because they're not as bad as gphoto2
[15:31:27] <Lebela> ok!
[15:31:31] <grawity> MTP is kinda flaky in general
[15:31:39] <Lebela> which one, mtpfs or jmtpfs ?
[15:31:50] <grawity> but when GNOME switched its MTP client from gphoto2-based to libmtpfs-based (or something similar), it became *way* more stable
[15:31:54] <djph> grawity: yeah, I honestly never understood the draw vs. "USB Mass Storage"
[15:32:00] <Lebela> grawity, it is not MTP I believe
[15:32:16] <grawity> djph: don't need to dismount the storage / shutdown Android, of course
[15:32:17] <Lebela> one moment
[15:32:43] <grawity> Lebela: if you're accessing it over gphotofs, then it's either MTP or (older, pictures-only) PTP
[15:32:44] <Lebela> PTP it is called
[15:33:00] <grawity> nearly all phones support both PTP and MTP

[15:33:05] <Lebela> yes, it is "PTP"
[15:33:31] <Lebela> I even tried "kdeconnect" but that is way too slow
[15:33:51] <Lebela> I am now looking into "jmtpfs"
[15:34:17] <grawity> if it truly supports only PTP but not MTP (I'm not sure if mtpfs is PTP-compatible), then `gphoto2 --get-all-files` might be a little more stable without rsync and FUSE being involved
[15:35:04] <Lebela> thank you grawity

[15:39:58] <Lebela> grawity, like mounting it or so?

[15:41:13] <Soliton> probably have to unmount /mnt/photo.
[15:41:16] <Lebela> nevermind

[15:54:08] <Lebela> even though I've just newly plugged it in

[15:54:42] <Lebela> I hate it when GUIs interrupt my work flow

[22:54:22] <greycat> The ONLY way you could execute  array=($(ls *.so))  and get an array element that ends with .so.xyz is if you had a filename that ended with ".so.xyz .so" and it was mangled by word splitting.

[23:32:23] <greycat> mra90: ls put a literal * at the end of each result

[23:32:36] <mra90> greycat, this is gitbash default - I have't set it up like this

[23:33:38] <llua> and that vendors configure shells horribly
[23:33:42] <mra90> and as for "one of */=>@|" which one exactly is applied and when?
[23:34:03] <Soliton> check the documentation.
[23:34:40] <mra90> but still one questions remains left
[23:35:05] <mra90> why in my test folder where I put both .exe and .exe.sth files it was wroking fine and only .exe files wher matched?
[23:35:10] <mra90> were*
[23:35:23] <Soliton> did you mark them executable?
[23:35:28] <emanuele6> because the .exe.sth files did not have a corresponding .exe file probably.
[23:35:33] <Soliton> (no.)

[23:36:46] <emanuele6> it does not.

[23:37:14] <mra90> yes
[23:37:17] <greycat> It uses the permissions.  Just like the documentation says.  If you don't read a FUCKING GNU MAN PAGE as your documentation.
[23:37:28] <Soliton> unquoted expansion do wordsplitting and pathname expansion (globbing).
[23:38:01] <Soliton> thus $(ls *.exe) splits and expands the output of ls.
[23:38:11] <mra90> aa so the .exe file with start at the end is treated as a regex after the substitution
[23:38:24] <Soliton> no regex involved anywhere.
[23:38:29] <Soliton> !glob

[23:40:12] <Soliton> hmmn, getting boring.
[23:40:19] <greycat> the first glob generates bsim-afh.exe which is passed to ls, which writes bsim-afh.exe* (due to the -F option), and then the second round of globbing (expansion of the command substitution) turns bsim-afh.exe* into two filenames
