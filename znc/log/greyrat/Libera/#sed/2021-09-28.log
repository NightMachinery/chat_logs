[00:28:37] <emg> is busybox wrong here? http://ix.io/3Abe
[00:29:44] <emg> or is it possible searching for 4 instead of 2 in the //d because of the /4/ as the end range?
[00:30:09] <emg> ah, it is, dammit
[00:30:16] <emg> printf %s\\n 1 24 3 4 5 | busybox sed -n '/2/,/4/{//d;p}'
[00:30:43] <emg> now I'm not sure which is posix conformant
[00:31:31] <geirha> "If an RE is empty (that is, no pattern is specified) sed shall behave as if the last RE used in the last command applied (either as an address or as part of a substitute command) was specified."
[00:32:30] <geirha> when it enters the range, /2/ is the address that matches, so most implementations interpret that as // matching 2 in that case
[00:34:54] <phy1729> I'd argue since the command isn't done yet, that RE isn't elegible for // yet
[00:35:16] <phy1729> In    /foo/!d;/bar/s///g     should foos or bars get removed?
[00:36:45] <geirha> The wording is a bit vague, but GNU and BSD's interpretations makes more sense
[00:37:00] <ramok> phy1729: bars
[00:38:25] <phy1729> So just the last RE applied not the last RE in the last command which means in emg's case it should be 4
[00:38:51] <emg> phy1729: depends if the implementation searched for the end of the range on the line that matched the beginning of the range
[00:38:51] <geirha> first time the //d runs, the last RE that matched was 2
[00:39:02] <emg> if not, then the last part of the range isn't the one for // on the first line
[00:39:27] <emg> can't remember what I did there...
[00:39:57] <emg> yeah when I implemented I ended up same as GNU here
[00:40:10] <emg> which explains why that's what I thought should happen
[00:40:31] <phy1729> Shouldn't the /4/ RE also be run on the first line?
[00:40:42] <geirha> no
[00:40:54] <geirha> it starts looking for the end match on the next line
[00:41:54] <phy1729> "An editing command with two addresses shall select the inclusive range from the first pattern space that matches the first address through the next pattern space that matches the second."  Ok I suppose that agrees with POSIX
[00:41:55] <emg> An editing command with two addresses shall select the inclusive range from the first pattern space that matches the first address through the next pattern space that matches the second. (If the second address is a number less than or equal to the line number first selected, only one line shall be selected.) Starting at the first line following the selected range, sed shall look again for the first address. Thereafter, the process shall be repeat
[00:42:49] <emg> files this under "annoyances using alpine"
[00:43:03] <geirha> # printf '%s\n' a b a c | sed -n '/a/,/a/=' | paste -s
[00:43:05] <shbot> geirha: 1       2       3
[00:43:54] <geirha> I've managed to mostly just ignore and avoid alpine
[00:44:08] <phy1729> It's real popular in containers
[00:44:46] <geirha> Yes, but most official images have debian/ubuntu alternatives, so I pick those
[00:45:09] <emg> in this instance, building a go binary with cgo in a container, can't statically link with glibc thanks to getaddrinfo weirdness, so using the go alpine images is the easiest way to get a statically linked binary
[00:48:16] <ramok> in alpine are busybox with musl?
[00:48:36] <lopid> alpine is musl, yes
[00:48:49] <emg> and busybox instead of coreutils and other common utils
[00:49:32] <lopid> alpine has coreutils
[00:54:52] <geirha> just have to install it first
[01:15:51] <earnestly> Ideally toybox should replace much of this, busybox really does have some nasty aspects because it's just not POSIX
[01:18:47] <emg> in many ways busybox tries to be GNUlite
[01:20:05] <emg> at least they ditched the GNU style guide
[01:21:59] *** Joins: bomb-on (~bomb-on@194.144.47.113)
[01:24:21] <phy1729> Did they copy the requirement for -- for non-suprising/broken arg parsing?  (i.e.   some_command -a foo -b  (with neither -a nor -b taking arguments) treats foo as an argument and -a and -b as options)
[01:25:36] <emg> http://ix.io/3Abq
[01:25:39] <emg> like that?
[01:25:57] <emg> which I must admit I do use when I'm in an interactive shell :-/
[01:28:49] <phy1729> yes like that

[01:42:03] <earnestly> Then again, cc has weird flags anyway
[01:45:46] <emg> yep
[01:46:42] <emg> I do my best to avoid GNUisms but in some projects, specifically work projects not hobby projects, it's tough to avoid/it's just so easy to use them and I know the code doesn't have to be portable at all
[01:49:09] <phy1729> I figure it introduces some bugs into otherwise bug free code say   cp Makefile *.c dest   will fail if -.c exists
