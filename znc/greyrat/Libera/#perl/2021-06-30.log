[00:58:31] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ GitHub Copilot: your AI pair programmer | Hacker News ]
[00:58:47] <clscott> veesh: go for it! the more people looking at tree sitter for perl the better
[00:59:19] <clscott> veesh: I will be a guinea pig and use it when you are ready
[00:59:34] <simcop2387> a tree sitter parser has the potential to re-implement the parts of perl that are needed to parse perl.   probably not perfectly but almost certainly far more effectively than the others
[01:00:18] <clscott> veesh: for alpha testing
[01:01:18] <simcop2387> and i might have gotten my full cpan scripting system done enough by then to see if i can make something parse all of cpan
[01:01:54] <clscott> simcop2387: whooo!
[01:02:42] <simcop2387> clscott: yea the hope is thatt i can eventually get this all going to run full cpan bleed testing for perl.  and eventually any other experiments that we can think of
[01:04:23] <clscott> simcop2387: You have my full, enthusiastic virtual support
[01:05:26] <simcop2387> my main issue is that i hit the classic cpan problem of trying to handle the dependency stuff sanely.  i need to revisit it and try to redesign a lot of this in a multi-phase approach but it's not easy because there's some older code that doesn't have the modern cpan stuff
[01:05:35] *** Quits: tcohen (~tcohen@192.141.149.51) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[01:06:12] <simcop2387> it's basically a giant set of minion jobs to install perl and then build every cpan module and install them into that perl.  once that works i'll end up modularising it a bit more
[01:08:36] <simcop2387> an eventual goal also is to start recording the actual things that every cpan module does to find any funny behavior for security scanning
[01:10:34] <simcop2387> but that'll take a lot more work on my part for it

[08:29:32] <Grinnz> Adura: unfortuantely, file slurping and json are both operations where guessing is most likely to result in bad choices
[08:30:22] <Grinnz> (those bad choices being File::Slurp and JSON)
[08:39:00] <Grinnz> it would be great if we could get some of https://github.com/EnlightenedPerlOrganisation/task-kensho/issues processed so we could continue pointing people there
[08:39:01] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Issues · EnlightenedPerlOrganisation/task-kensho · GitHub ]
[08:40:38] <Adura> Seems excessive to need a module for a simple file slurp. But, maybe I'm not considering certain cases.
[08:40:58] <Grinnz> that depends how you define "simple" :)
[08:42:01] <fling> Which module to use for writing vcards from a hash or something? :>
[08:42:04] <Grinnz> (it's more useful for read_text/slurp_utf8 which people get very wrong, but people still get read_binary wrong too)
[08:43:17] <Grinnz> also, `my $contents = read_binary $filepath;` is much nicer to write and read than `open my $fh, '<:raw', $filepath or die "failed to open $filepath for reading: $!"; my $contents = do { local $/; readline $fh };`

[08:49:01] <Grinnz> anyway, you can search for modules on metacpan.org, but asking for recommendations is definitely encouraged, for the above reasons
[08:50:26] <adhoc> is the set of packages in Task::Kensho still considered a good place to start ?
[08:50:45] <Grinnz> sure, it's just missing some and a couple of them are outdated
[08:50:53] <adhoc> ok
[08:51:02] <Grinnz> but if you look through the issue tracker for the type of thing you're interested in, that'll probably fill in the gap

[09:55:41] <pragma-> What's wrong with JSON? :(
[09:55:57] <pragma-> It was recommended to me at the time ... I suppose that time was quite a few years ago, but ...
[09:58:10] <xenu> the main problem is that it prefers JSON::XS as the backend, which sucks
[09:58:24] <pragma-> sucks how?
[09:59:03] <pragma-> JSON::XS is the 4th choice in that list that I linked to in Config::Any::JSON
[09:59:06] <xenu> it's lehmannware, it has bugs and it has weird type conversion rules
[09:59:19] <xenu> the latter is a huge footgun
[10:00:14] <pragma-> Well, Config::Any is one of the task-kensho recommendations and I was looking it over and spotted its JSON module and that's what it has in it 
[10:00:18] <xenu> to explain what i mean:
[10:00:21] <xenu> eval: use JSON::XS; my $foo = 7; encode_json [$foo];
[10:00:22] *** Joins: kylese (~kylese@p5dd8ba69.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)

[10:00:29] <perlbot> xenu: ["7"]
[10:00:35] <xenu> for comparison:
[10:00:39] <xenu> eval: use Cpanel::JSON::XS; my $foo = 7;  encode_json [$foo];
[10:00:41] <perlbot> xenu: [7]

[10:00:46] <perlbot> xenu: [7]
[10:00:52] <pragma-> hm
[10:01:40] <xenu> tbh i'm not a big fan of JSON::MaybeXS either, because while it prefers Cpanel::JSON::XS it may use JSON::XS when the former isn't available, which may result in surprises
[10:01:42] <Grinnz> it prefers Cpanel::JSON::XS and JSON::MaybeXS for a reason
[10:01:46] <xenu> i prefer using Cpanel::JSON::XS directly
[10:02:05] <Grinnz> though i don't know if JSON::DWIW should be there
[10:02:14] <pragma-> that's a weird chain of preferences that Any::Config::JSON uses then
[10:02:27] <pragma-> bit self-referential and redundant 
[10:02:55] <Grinnz> well yes, it's impossible for it to have JSON 2 and not have JSON::PP 2 for one
[10:02:56] <xenu> otoh Cpanel::JSON::XS has a stupid name
[10:03:01] <xenu> reini was supposed to change it
[10:03:12] <xenu> but he didn't

[10:08:28] <Grinnz> yes, and a much more lightweight wrapper than JSON
[10:08:42] <Grinnz> so if all you want is "wrapper that gives me best practice" it's usually fine
[10:08:59] <perigrin> And less … ambitious … than JSON::Any

[10:18:10] <pragma-> I was just looking at DateTime::Tiny now and it seems like to actually DO anything with it you have to load the real DateTime anyway. DateTime::Tiny also only represents times as ISO 8601 which doesn't seem to include timezones, though I guess if I just use UTC/GMT ...
[10:19:16] <pragma-> It makes me feel bad about using DateTime.  "Loads 3mb to RAM!"
[10:21:16] <Grinnz> yes, the date module section should just be DateTime, Time::Moment, and Time::Piece
[10:21:36] <Grinnz> nobody uses any of the others listed there
[10:21:48] <perigrin> Oh and early on I had aspirations regarding Task::Kensho turning into a real dist like strawberry … the EPO was new and was helping
[10:22:28] <perigrin> Grinnz: much like IRC.Perl.org I know a guy who can merge PRs ;)
[10:22:46] <Grinnz> if you are just doing UTC, Time::Moment is by far the easiest (unless you need strptime, in which case you can steal that from Time::Piece and then use Time::Moment->from_object)
[10:22:48] <perigrin> And we can prod ether into cutting a release
[10:23:24] <Grinnz> perigrin: well if you want i can make a PR for each open issue, wasnt sure about what is actually desired though
[10:23:48] <Grinnz> though some of them are pretty cut and dry

[10:25:08] <perigrin> Same
[10:27:15] <Grinnz> pragma-: DateTime, Time::Moment and Time::Piece are sorta like postgres, redis, and elasticsearch... they each do things the others don't so you use the one(s) suited for the task
[10:27:41] <Grinnz> though technically DateTime does everything, it's also the slowest

[10:28:09] <Grinnz> and its API is... not ideal
[10:29:01] <Grinnz> but if you are aware of the mutable object trap and it's not a performance bottleneck for your task, DateTime is the easiest way to not screw up date tasks
[10:30:54] <perigrin> Kinda wish MoonPig got more attention
[10:31:04] <Grinnz> i wish it was less of a hack

[20:19:13] <genio> japh: Don't worry. _Everyone_ who joins a new place/team has a period where they know nothing. You know how to program, but you have zero knowledge of the business. It takes time to learn all of the reasons _why_ this is that way, etc.
[20:19:38] <genio> It's absolutely expected that you know nothing to start.

[20:21:48] <genio> It's hard to do, but just remember that every time you see something crazily broken, it might be that way due to some weird business reason you can't be expected to know anything about. File it away to ask about later when you understand things more. unless you're xenu

[22:07:53] <xenu> tbh i don't care about stuff he posts in his private repositories

[23:07:38] <pflanze> I'm currently designing an "id" protocol, that returns a string that uniquely identifies the input value.
[23:08:08] <El_Che> a hash?
[23:08:10] <pflanze> I intentionally want to leave it open whether hashing is used to achieve this. If hashes are used they must be long enough to make conflicts unlikely.
[23:08:31] <thrig> it's gensym Jim but not as we know it
[23:08:33] <pflanze> But in any case I want to double check whether there's something like a hash 'protocol' already somewhere.
[23:08:49] <thrig> such as Symbol::gensym
[23:09:02] <nirnam> A digest?
[23:09:34] <pflanze> thrig, not "create a new value that identifies itself by name", but "take existing value and return an identifier string".
[23:10:10] <pflanze> It can also be based on the pointer of the object, if applicable.
[23:10:15] <Grinnz> pflanze: well, depends if it needs to be reversible, largely
[23:11:54] <pflanze> "Applicable" here really means either that equality doesn't matter and mutation does (less interesting to me, given my functional interest), or that constructors would need to re-use existing objects for the same field values (to ensure pointer values are the same).
[23:12:34] <pflanze> Grinnz, what do you mean with reversible? An identifier must uniquely identify a value currently in memory.
[23:13:11] <pflanze> In that sense, reversible. But it should also not be long (should be ~20 bytes long, or shorter if feasible), thus can't be serialisation.
[23:13:12] <Grinnz> sure, it sounds like one way hashing is what you want
[23:13:17] <Grinnz> two way hashing is also a thing though
[23:13:54] <Grinnz> reversible would mean you could get the original value from only the hash
[23:14:14] <Grinnz> (and possibly some already-known info)
[23:14:35] <pflanze> That's not the purpose. The purpose is for it to be used for mapping (like data structures with key => value where key must be a string).
[23:15:10] <Grinnz> so the other question is, are the values strings? or structures?
[23:15:26] *** Quits: thrig (~thrig@65.113.153.50) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:16:10] <pflanze> Anything. I've defined an interface with an FP_Id_id method for this. And an `id` function that, if the argument is not an object, falls back to hard-coded routines for the type in question.
[23:16:48] <pflanze> Structures can then provide their own implementation in the best way for them.
[23:17:03] <Grinnz> well, i'm not sure there's anything existing that would simplify what you've already setup; the only generic hashing mechanism for something like that is to serialize the value and then hash it with something like sha256
[23:18:06] <pflanze> I'm going through this exactly to avoid the need for that inefficiency :)
[23:18:24] <Grinnz> serializing it with a non-human-readable serialization method like sereal would reduce the chances you'd get conflicts between structures and strings
[23:19:14] <pflanze> The idea is that data structures implement id updates on changes; add a new item to a set of 1mio elements? Just xor the id with the id of the new item, or something like that.
[23:20:02] <pflanze> (I still need to fully think through the implications for the id requirements so that xor is safe here.)
[23:21:27] <pflanze> The usefulness of this is probably unique to immutable data structures, as you want to use the identifier across the whole life time of the DS. And that can then not be mutated.
[23:21:53] <Grinnz> yeah, don't premature optimize for things that you won't need it for
[23:22:25] <pflanze> Thing is, I do need it for my immutable data structures.

[23:23:08] <pflanze> I've got an algorithm that benefits from caching of function results keyed on their inputs, and so I need a cache key.
[23:24:17] <pflanze> (And one of the inputs of that function is a large set.)

[23:27:46] <Grinnz> well for that, there is Memoize
[23:28:03] *** Quits: Tempesta (Tempesta@user/tempesta) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:29:44] <pflanze> Yes, exactly memoize, but an implementation of it that is efficient for large inputs.
[23:31:08] <pflanze> i.e. where the inputs can be modified incrementally, and provide the cache key efficiently (and it will need purely functional data structures for this).
[23:31:55] <pflanze> (Instead of serializing and hashing my whole 1mio element set, I just ask for the id that it already recalculated while adding or removing the last element or two.)

[23:41:29] <pflanze> Looks like Memoize provides an "N" option for a normalizer that does what my `id` does. So I'm implementing a protocol for such normalizers.
