[02:15:30] <JEEB> muji369: SUP itself seems to be a fan-grown thing (basically blu-ray subpicture packets within a very slight container), so you can look at the supenc muxer for example in FFmpeg to look at that thing. but the actual subpicture format within is defined in the blu-ray specification
[02:17:54] <JEEB> right, the official name for the subpicture format that is put into the SUP container is "HDMV Presentation Graphics stream" (which is why it often gets called PGS)

[02:58:29] <muji369> JEEB: if one wanted to decode a sup file from (say) python, what course of action would you suggest?
[02:59:13] <JEEB> muji369: well first you handle the SUP part :P
[02:59:23] <JEEB> which is parsing packets out of the SUP "container" with their timestamps
[02:59:59] <muji369> JEEB: so <https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/4.0/supenc_8c_source.html> in reverse?
[03:00:19] <muji369> i guess looking at the mkvmerge source would be another thing to do
[03:00:37] <JEEB> or http://git.1f0.de/gitweb/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=libavformat/supdec.c;h=fbcc744bb4504cf110bfb5cfc11a77cf2aed5b80;hb=HEAD;js=1
[03:00:40] <JEEB> which is the reader
[03:01:12] <JEEB> do note that this is just the container though
[03:01:48] <JEEB> then to actually decode the subpictures - if that is something you want to do - I'd probably just utilize an existing implementation :D unless you are taking it in as a learning experience
[03:02:19] <muji369> JEEB: no, no learning experience
[03:02:28] <muji369> i mean i'll probably end up learning something

[05:05:11] <BtbN> Might just be the video starting with a negative timestamp, and it underflows to the max possible timestamp

[05:07:07] <BtbN> it's not uncommon and not invalid at all to start audio or video at a negative timestamp, so sync it up with the other stream

[07:46:00] <Lebela> hi
[07:46:25] <Lebela> My videos have all 30 fps, but I cannot be 100% sure of it.
[07:46:32] <Lebela> My camera claims it's 30 fps, but who knows.
[07:46:47] <Lebela> However that may be,  I am not able to create a smooth intro + outro for my videos with 30 fps
[07:47:02] <Lebela> the intro and the outro are totally "shaky" with only 30 fps
[07:47:12] <Lebela> I need at least 60, better 120 fps for intro + outro
[07:47:42] <Lebela> Question 1:  Can I combine a 120 fps intro + outro  with a 30 fps video to one dynamic fps video?
[07:48:39] <Lebela> Question 2:  If the answer to question 1 is "no", then please tell me if increasing the framerate of the "main video" would be bad... from 30 to 120 fps just to match intro + outro
[07:48:53] <Lebela> elaboration for question 2:
[07:49:06] <Lebela> concatenation of:
[07:49:21] <Lebela> intro (120 fps naturally)   +   main video at 30 fps INCREASED to 120 fps    +   outro  (120 fps naturally)

[13:27:00] <JEEB> don't expect instant answer, stick around
[13:27:08] <dreamer> this is the way
[13:27:10] <Lebela> ok JEEB
[13:27:19] <Lebela> I have tried my very best with my ffmpeg command

[13:28:49] <JEEB> at least you are mapping the final result :P
[13:29:25] <JEEB> have you tried whether without a time range it works?
[13:29:29] <Lebela> JEEB, I wonder if there is a limit to the amount of overlays to the concatenated video
[13:29:35] <JEEB> no
[13:29:38] <Lebela> maybe I should apply the overlays before... the the main video
[13:29:40] <JEEB> it's a separate output
[13:29:43] <JEEB> and input
[13:30:05] <JEEB> one instance does not see the other
[13:30:25] <Lebela> JEEB, let me try without the time codes
[13:30:26] <Lebela> brb
[13:31:01] <JEEB> I'd just focus on validating it step by step. first whether it gets decoded correctly. then whether the colorkey/crop works. then finally overlaying it
[13:31:19] <JEEB> first in the most simple way that can be checked, and then adding more things
[13:35:17] <Lebela> wait
[13:35:19] <Lebela> yes
[13:35:37] <Lebela> I know what is happening!  The second video gets hidden behind the first video

[13:43:51] <Lebela> oh. my. god.
[13:44:00] <Lebela> I know exactly what is going on, and it is a frigging nightmare
[13:44:07] <Lebela> JEEB, are you still there?
[13:44:22] <Lebela> what I just found out destroys everything I had planned
[13:45:02] <Lebela> when I play the videos _without_ the "enable" thingy (so it should play from the beginning) it works!!
[13:45:47] <Lebela> so I went back to enabling the videos only between certain times
[13:46:09] <Lebela> the problem is:
[13:46:20] <Lebela> the video seems to be "secretly" playing before I enable it
[13:46:38] <Lebela> let's say, it is a 10 seconds long clip which I only enable at second 15-25  then the video will never be animated
[13:46:47] <Lebela> ffmpeg will only show me the last frame
[13:47:58] <Lebela> that totally contradicts everything I had planned
[13:47:59] <JEEB> most likely it's a case of "if PTS is not within activated range, pass through" :P not actually starting that thing at that point
[13:48:06] <Lebela> I wanted to show a "subscribe animation"
[13:48:19] <Lebela> the subscribe animation will only be 10 seconds long
[13:48:43] <Lebela> so, if I told ffmpeg to show the animation at 00:03:00 of the video (3 mins in) the animation would already be over
[13:49:20] <Lebela> JEEB: Do you know what I mean with "subscribe animation" ?
[13:49:22] <JEEB> yea so you want to grab that 10 second slot and apply it on top of there :P not say "only actually apply this overlay filter from time X to time Y"
[13:49:40] <Lebela> yeah... so after for example 3 minutes play the animation
[13:49:45] <Lebela> a subscribe button which gets clicked
[13:49:58] <c_14> Lebela: you can try adjusting the setpts= for the 2nd overlay to PTS-STARTPTS+10
[13:50:03] <JEEB> ^
[13:50:03] <Lebela> but ffmpeg seems to be playing the whole animation in the background from the beginning, so after 3 mins, there is nothing
[13:50:17] <JEEB> since it's based on the timestamps and PTS was already getting overridden
[13:50:23] <JEEB> I would have said what c_14 noted
[13:50:24] <Lebela> c_14, thank you! please tell me more about it
[13:50:42] <JEEB> just offset the pts to the location you need it, since the filter chain bases on timestamps
[13:50:48] <Lebela> I must admit, I never quite understood the PTS part
[13:50:56] <Lebela> I only did it because it was in every tutorial ;)
[13:50:57] <c_14> so setpts=PTS-STARTPTS+<value> will offset the timestamps so the video "starts" later
[13:51:07] <Lebela> and I know that I need to divide the PTS when I want to make the video faster
[13:51:11] <JEEB> STARTPTS is the initial PTS of the stream
[13:51:17] <JEEB> and PTS is the PTS of the frame
[13:51:19] <Lebela> what are PTS?
[13:51:23] <JEEB> presentation timestamp
[13:51:29] <Lebela> ah
[13:51:31] <Lebela> let me try
[13:51:43] <JEEB> basically you are dragging the timeline to start at zero :P
[13:51:58] <JEEB> since if you have first frame of PTS 1337, and your STARTPTS is 1337
[13:52:05] <JEEB> and then next frame is 1338

[13:52:57] <JEEB> just explaining to you wtf you are doing with it
[13:53:00] <Lebela> I was just calculating how you did it
[13:53:01] <JEEB> that pts override

[13:53:10] <Lebela> is this the value I need?
[13:53:15] <Lebela> 5400 ?
[13:53:26] <JEEB> if there is a timebase
[13:53:35] <JEEB> then timebase times (3*60)

[13:53:48] <Lebela> I don't know if I have a timebae in my command?!

[14:50:50] <Eighth_Doctor> JEEB: so I've filed a ticket in the ffmpeg trac so it's not forgotten: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9645
[14:50:56] <Eighth_Doctor> maybe someday it'll get implemented
[14:58:59] <JEEB> making a ticket is generally good, but since you're the primary side possibly wanting such a thing, it might make sense to attempt to implement it (since most likely you'd most likely also have access to lawyers that could say whether limiting the slice coding stuff out is enough or not - like nevcairiel mentioned that it seemed handwavy). I know opensuse also ships a very limited build for probably similar
[14:59:05] <JEEB> reasons, and Plex is doing some limiting I think? might be worth poking at rcombs or so to check.
[15:00:16] <JEEB> since if the reasoning is patents, basically you'd have to check if even parsing the packets (so that things can be passed to the hardware slice decoding) is enough

[19:05:57] <othernewguy> hi all. apologies if anyone feels I'm wasting bandwidth, but I have what I think is a simple enough question about deinterlacing that is more about the command line usage than about technicalities of what's best
[19:08:56] <othernewguy> question is this: I was happily using an older version (4.4), inputing an mpg, then simply calling "-deinterlace" and everything worked fine. Since updating to 5.0, this command no longer works and I guess I have to use yadif?
[19:09:57] <othernewguy> so I'm basically confused as to what the old -deinterlace was even using in the first place and cannot find documentation about it. or is it that I have to rebuild ffmpeg to do the same thing?
[19:12:05] <othernewguy> again, sorry. I've tried googling and digging through fora. Thought I sort of understood enough, but it seems just enough to get totally lost. End of the day, I just want to be able to replicate whatever -deinterlace was doing in 4.4 to whatever it is supposed to be in 5.0.
[19:22:35] <JEEB> deinterlace used to do something something different way in the olden days. then I think it started mapping to yadif
[19:22:55] <furq> yeah
[19:23:06] <furq> https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/4.0/ffmpeg__filter_8c_source.html#l00821
[19:23:10] <JEEB> yes, it seems to have just added yadif without any options
[19:23:20] <JEEB> while you might want to specify options yourself
[19:23:28] <JEEB> https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#yadif-1
[19:23:50] <JEEB> this is the removal commit http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blobdiff;f=fftools/ffmpeg_filter.c;h=452b689d62fef8a7cf304de9b0a0e634f898fcf1;hp=c70903295f5be3e996949b7973ca45d462f8e22f;hb=d013453caafcc44c74d4bdbaa99ee4e8f32414cb;hpb=9d4e290ec46b29c305dbd5da5913d30efa9db80f
[19:24:30] <furq> it's marked deprecated in 4.0
[19:24:37] <furq> idk how much of a fuss it made if you tried to use it though
[19:25:13] <JEEB> it did note that > "this option is deprecated, use the yadif filter instead"
[19:25:53] <JEEB> although I think that only showed up in help
[19:27:00] <furq> othernewguy: if you're already using -vf in your command then put yadif first

[19:59:07] <Lebela> re
[19:59:10] <Lebela> Please help me,  I cannot get the chromakey to work (same command as before)
[19:59:28] <Lebela> I am doing it according to the documentation of ffmpeg
[20:00:07] <Lebela> similarity is 0.01  (which means:  ONLY the pixels that are exactly the color code)
[20:00:20] <Lebela> and for blend, I tried  0.00  up to 1.00
[20:00:27] <Lebela> whatever I do,  my results get messy
[20:00:40] <Lebela> I have a subscribe-animation that tells people to kindly subscribe
[20:01:07] <Lebela> my first attempts led to a semi-translucent subscribe-bar  (the buttons, etc.)
[20:01:19] <Lebela> later I managed to get the subscribe-bar to a full opacity
[20:01:25] <Lebela> but then the entire video had a green tint
[20:01:34] <Lebela> I have tried so many values, but nothing works for me
[20:01:59] <Lebela> the only colors I use are:
[20:02:11] <Lebela> light-grey,  dark-grey,  black,  red,  white
[20:02:18] <Lebela> so there is nothing that remotely looks like green
[20:02:26] <Lebela> and the background is pure green  (#00ff00)
[20:02:39] <Lebela> Please, somebody tell me why Chromakey fails for me
[20:03:22] <Lebela> 1) colorkey=0x3BBD1E:0.2:0.3
[20:03:33] <Lebela> 2) colorkey=0x3BBD1E:0.01:0.0
[20:03:36] <Lebela> 2) colorkey=0x3BBD1E:0.01:1.0
[20:03:43] <Lebela> ^ that was 3) ;)
[20:03:52] <Lebela> 4) colorkey=0x3BBD1E:0.01:0.5
[20:04:10] <Lebela> I have tried so many variations, but according to the documentation,  0.01:0.00  should be right
[20:05:58] <Lebela> c_14, in case you are still around,  it's the same command you saw before
[20:06:14] <Lebela> the command where I concatenate and apply the chromakey at the same time
[20:08:28] <c_14> have you tried using chromakey instead of colorkey?
[20:09:30] <Lebela> I thought I was using chromakey?
[20:09:33] <Lebela> oh
[20:09:35] <Lebela> I was using colorkey
[20:09:45] <Lebela> I can't stop swearing today ;)
[20:09:45] <BtbN> colorkey is for keying out precise RGB colors
[20:09:55] <Lebela> thank you
[20:09:56] <Lebela> sorry
[20:10:01] <BtbN> chromakey is designed for fuzzy greenscreens
[20:10:02] <Lebela> guys, you're the best
[20:10:05] <Lebela> thank you for being here
[20:10:16] <Lebela> BtbN, my green screen is 100% computer generated
[20:10:25] <Lebela> so I can be sure, the hexcode is _exactly_ accurate
[20:10:29] <Lebela> it is #00ff00
[20:10:37] <BtbN> That's an RGB hex-code though
[20:10:45] <BtbN> it'll be in YUV colors, and the conversion can be fuzzy
[20:11:10] <Lebela> I leave everything in the syntax the way it is, right?
[20:11:16] <Lebela> so I only replace "colorkey" with "chromakey" ?
[20:11:30] <BtbN> they're not 100% interchangeable, but roughly similar
[20:12:02] <Lebela> chromakey=0x3BBD1E:0.01:0.0
[20:12:13] <Lebela> is this what I want for a hex code #00ff00 ?
[20:12:23] <Lebela> the color code looks wrong to me
[20:12:31] <BtbN> just write green
[20:12:48] <Lebela> How will ffmpeg know which green?
[20:13:03] <BtbN> green is pure green
[20:13:20] <BtbN> If you use a specific tint, you'll have to supply the exact color code
[20:14:21] <Lebela> chromakey=green:0.01:0.0
[20:14:25] <Lebela> is this what you want?
[20:14:33] <BtbN> yes
[20:14:35] <Lebela> thank you
[20:14:55] <Lebela> Just to be sure you guys know:  Before coming here, I always do a ton of research
[20:15:00] <BtbN> if you want to specify precise yuv colors, there is also the yuv option to interpret the color option as yuv
[20:15:01] <Lebela> but I am kind of dumbstruck today
[20:15:17] <BtbN> By default, the color option is interpreted as rgb
[20:15:18] <Lebela> BtbN, exact colors would be nice, yes
[20:16:30] <BtbN> I don't think you understand the difference between YUV and RGB.
[20:18:03] <Lebela> oh, you can be sure of that  (of me NOT knowing)
[20:18:23] <Lebela> can't I just convert  hex to yuv ?
[20:20:17] <bencoh> the rgb->yuv "conversion" involves more than just copying values, there is a conversion matrix involved (as in matrix multiplication)
[20:20:50] <bencoh> s/involves/implies/
[20:21:28] <Lebela> so, to save myself a lot of trouble, I will just write "green", I suppose?
[20:21:58] <Lebela> just out of curiosity,  why did they replace the famous blue screen with green screens in movies?
[20:22:06] <Lebela> when I was a kid,  they had blue screens
[20:23:48] <bencoh> as B.tbN said if you want to specify a yuv-encoded color you can do so by adding the "yuv" flag as part of the chromakey arguments

[20:27:27] <Lebela> >> 0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent, or not transparent at all.

[20:28:16] <BtbN> if you initially made an RGB pure green, converting it to YUV can result in a slightly different color depending on conversion matrix and subsampling
[20:28:16] <Lebela> let me double-check with a screenshot in the GIMP
[20:28:28] <BtbN> it's not 00ff00 anymore when converted to YUV...
[20:28:31] <bencoh> if I were you I'd convert your greenscreen to YUV, have a look at the resulting "green", and specify your chromakey as yuv
[20:29:05] <Lebela> guys, can you please do me a big favour?
[20:29:08] <BtbN> There's like a dozen different ways to convert RGB to YUV, so it's not all that straight forward
[20:29:28] <BtbN> can just leave it as RGB-Green, and turn up the similarity value a bit
[20:29:45] <Lebela> It was a couple of long days.  I am exhausted.
[20:29:48] <Lebela> But I must finish it.
[20:30:01] <Lebela> Please, tell me how to proceed in terms of a command
[20:30:21] <Lebela> you said convert the video to yuv
[20:30:22] <BtbN> There is no straight forward answer like that.
[20:30:37] <Lebela> is this a command only?
[20:30:41] <BtbN> what?
[20:30:49] <Lebela> I mean an ffmpeg command?
[20:30:58] <Lebela> and then I take a screenshot in the gimp and find out the yuv value?
[20:30:58] <BtbN> I don't know what you're asking.
[20:31:03] <Lebela> me neither
[20:31:08] <BtbN> The screenshot will be RGB again.
[20:31:23] <BtbN> Videos are YUV 99% of the time
[20:31:51] <bencoh> actually better try what B.tbN suggested first, ie change the similarity parameter to a more tolerant one
[20:32:02] <BtbN> really, just use the rgb input mode of chromakey, and turn up the similarity until it looks fine
[20:32:43] <Lebela> ok

[20:55:06] <Lebela> Okay, so, let me repeat:  I convert my video to yuv420.
[20:55:12] <Lebela> so there is a color shift from RGB to yuv
[20:55:20] <Lebela> but, there is no way for me to find out the yuv color
[20:55:35] <Lebela> however,  I know the RGB value which is 00ff00  and this is the default for chromakey
[20:55:46] <Lebela> but when I define 00ff00 in RGB which is default for the chromakey it fails
[20:56:02] <Lebela> so I am guessing the best value, and I always end up with a green border around the objects
[20:56:09] <Lebela> that is where I am currently at
[20:56:41] <BtbN> the green border is unavailable unless you make sure every edge is aligned to a multiple of two bounary, and no translucency or blend between green and what sits on top
[20:56:46] <BtbN> *unavoidable

[21:00:52] <Lebela> none of the other youtubers with subscribe animations have green borders
[21:00:56] <Lebela> at least none that I saw
[21:02:08] <Lebela> that is a brutally green,  1-2 px thick border

[21:08:05] <bencoh> they were using colorkey in the first place anyway
[21:08:29] <BtbN> Properly edited YT videos will use a full blown video editor who has a proper transparent effect for that which just gets dragged into the timeline.
[21:10:08] <BtbN> The moment you have round edges, or a smooth edge, you will get this kind of spilling with any kind of keying

[22:49:57] <Eighth_Doctor> rcombs: fedora doesn't ship the software enablement for the hardware stuff
[22:50:04] <rcombs> the hardware vendor hasn't already paid the patent license costs; one software vendor or another needs to do so
[22:50:06] <Eighth_Doctor> so it doesn't work unless you get the remaining pieces from vendors or whatever
[22:50:12] <rcombs> on windows and macos, that's the OS vendor
[22:50:22] <rcombs> on linux it can be the OS vendor or a particular app vendor
[22:50:39] <Eighth_Doctor> e.g. nvdec and nvenc can't work with just fedora
[22:50:50] <Eighth_Doctor> same for amf, qsv, etc.
[22:51:28] <rcombs> as we understand it, distributing a software implementation on a platform that is already licensed for the codecs doesn't incur additional costs
[22:51:33] <Eighth_Doctor> so it's just dead unless you get the remaining software pieces (nvidia cuda, intel media thingy, amdgpu-pro blobs, etc.)
[22:51:44] <Eighth_Doctor> yup
[22:51:49] <rcombs> so if the OS provides the license (as on mac and windows) you're fine
[22:51:58] <rcombs> and can just ship the full software decoder for free
[22:52:16] <Eighth_Doctor> right, but that's not the case on Linux sadly
[22:53:08] <Eighth_Doctor> I can't exactly explain the finer details, as I don't work for RH
[22:53:14] <Eighth_Doctor> I'm just doing what they say I'm allowed to do
[22:53:15] <rcombs> right, and nvidia/intel/amd don't pay when you install their drivers either
[22:53:38] <rcombs> so unless RH pays at the OS level (I assume not), the app vendor needs to
[22:53:40] <rcombs> that or the user
[22:53:49] <Eighth_Doctor> yeah
[22:53:57] <Eighth_Doctor> anyway, we're not shipping functioning codecs for these
[22:54:01] <rcombs> regardless of if they use a hardware or software impl

[22:56:43] <rcombs> at this point we get into a very "I am not a lawyer and you should consult one" territory, but the understanding our lawyers have given me is that even shipping a fully-functioning codec impl wouldn't give _you_ patent exposure as the distributor
[22:57:05] <rcombs> instead it would give your _users_ exposure if they made use of the implementation without paying for a license
[22:57:48] <rcombs> (so we of course pay for a license for each user who installs, say, the h264 decoder, the hevc encoder, etc, on a platform where the license isn't already provided)

[23:11:28] * Eighth_Doctor is on a Mac atm
[23:11:51] <JEEB> Eighth_Doctor: yea, 3GPP seems to have a nice side with that. ETSI is fun because you can find whatever corps want to stick into broadcast there often. You can find dolby's AC-4, the object based extensions for E-AC-3 (aka "Atmos"), the Dolby Vision color space mangling etc
[23:12:18] <JEEB> and then they find the most generic sounding specification names for those
[23:12:20] <Eighth_Doctor> AC-X stuff is a whole boatload of fun that I just cover my eyes on
[23:13:00] <JEEB> I think the sad side of that is that on the ETSI side you can just find the spec, while good luck getting finding the latest MPEG-H Audio spec... .-.
[23:14:40] <JEEB> and the reference code licensing is a mess. like, they let you utilize the code but in some cases they say it's only for that format. so if you are doing a project having an LGPL/GPL license, does this make that code unusable since technically your license does not disallow reusage of code that looks useful enough even across formats.
