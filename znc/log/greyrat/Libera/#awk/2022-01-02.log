[06:26:47] <yetoo> emanuele6: So I have a file "1" with a path with spaces in it "1 1 (space is escaped)" which looks like the following when escaped "dir1/1\ 1/1" (without quotes) I do the following command: shasum -a 512 dir1/1\ 1/1  | awk '{sub(/.* /,""); print}'  This outputs "1/1" (Without quotes). Since this is sub I expect it to instead replace just the first instance of space which is after hash so that print outputs "dir1/1\ 1/1" (without quotes). Why is this wrong? How 
[06:26:47] <yetoo> does properly escaping newlines and slashes help here?

[07:08:12] <nmz> it seems if the file contains a \, shasum will prepend a "\" to the hash

[07:13:01] <yetoo> yeah
[07:14:18] <roarde> here, shasum -a 512 test/1\ 1/1  prints

[07:18:46] <yetoo> roarde: I don't want backslashes Im getting the output I want but nmz is somehow not getting the same output
[07:20:30] <roarde> I believe nmz has a backlash, meant to quote a space, inside a string that's single-quoted; so the backslash becomes literal.

[10:58:21] <emanuele6> also even if you ignore the case in which the path contains newlines, so there are no escapes to unescape; and you assume that the files will always be hashed in text mode (-t; or omitted), so the characters before the path will always be a space; `$1="";sub(/^[ \t]+/,"")' will remove spaces from the start of the path

[19:18:08] <emanuele6> what?
[19:18:57] <nmz> that mode of operation
[19:19:39] <emanuele6> the output of sum programs is not really meant to be parsed
[19:20:28] <emanuele6> you usually run `shasum file1 file2 > hashes' and then check that the hashes are correct with `shasum -c hashes'
[19:21:26] <emanuele6> `shasum -c' reads the file line by line and checks the listed paths
[19:22:05] <emanuele6> the output of `shasum' is meant for `shasum -c', not other programs.

[19:37:37] <nmz> csv is ambiguous when you don't follow rfc.
[19:38:56] <emanuele6> why do you think tsv with escapes good?
[19:39:20] <emanuele6> i think escapes are generally bad for unix tools

[19:45:11] <emanuele6> oh, they also list that as a limitation on their page
[19:49:48] <emanuele6> i thought using `json2tsv -R '\x00'' would solve the problem
