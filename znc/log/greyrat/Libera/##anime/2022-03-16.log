[02:53:04] <Roey> Nanobot: yeah read that, nice
[02:55:15] <klaxa> daylight savings time is a conspiracy by big clock to sell you more clocks
[02:56:24] <HeTo> why did they choose to deliberately use the wrong time?
[03:00:56] <Sapphirus> Ontario already passed a bill and assented it, but it relies on NY and Quebec doing the same.
[03:01:10] <Sapphirus> Since the U.S. is likely to do it now, looks like we'll be following suit.
[03:01:56] <Roey> this clock move is so stupid
[03:01:59] <Sapphirus> Techincally standard time is GMT-04:00 in Ontario as codified in law, but it has to be activated by the governor in council.
[03:02:02] <Roey> spring forward fall back
[03:02:03] <Roey> etc.
[03:02:12] <Sapphirus> Which will be done once NY and Quebec follows suit.

[03:26:01] <Nanobot> Q. What is daylight savings time? A. Bullshit. Q. How did DST come into existence? A. It had to do with farmers. Farmers have cattle. Thus, bullshit. Q. If we stop doing DST transitions, what will the effect be on the environment? A. Less bullshit => less methane emissions => cleaner air and less climate change. Q. What will the effect be on the stock market? A. Less bullshit => happier bulls => better bull markets. Q. Does this fix the Y2K38 bug? A. No.

[05:52:54] <ButterNoodle> 46mpg is pretty nice
[05:53:09] <jessedesu_onaph> The more people carpool the less I have to lane split and the faster I go and the more mpg I get
[05:53:17] <ButterNoodle> ehhh
[05:53:30] <ButterNoodle> the cbr is most efficient at 80mph
[05:53:40] <jessedesu_onaph> Is it
[05:53:51] <ButterNoodle> more than that.. wind takes a considerable chunk out of the mpg

On the day of their meeting, he happens to encounter Amano Erika, a high school student at a prestigious and wealthy girls school. At her request, he's half-forced into pretending to be her boyfriend so she can avoid marrying her fiance....However, not only were they the babies who had been mixed up, they're also engaged to 
[07:38:31] <S_T_A_N> each other! The loving parents of both families officially recognize their engagement, and the couple begins living together. Nagi is in love with his classmate Segawa Hiro, and Erika is determined to rebel against her father, so the couple agree not to get involved with each other. The mixed-up and chaotic romantic comedy starts now! 
[07:50:53] <S_T_A_N> jessedesu2, getting a house 0 down or very little down is actually pretty easy
[07:51:41] <jessedesu2> So what's the hard part

[07:55:34] <S_T_A_N> and not having other debts 
[07:56:06] <S_T_A_N> I was offered like $300k but that would have been like 45% of my income on payments(like $1600/month which would be impossible) 
[07:56:35] <S_T_A_N> 45% pre tax. Well over 50% after tax

[11:28:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well I think the sociological affects our separate realities

[11:29:59] <DunceCotus> it may also be that certain states of consciousness put you on a 'wavelength' that others aren't on, so they become non-interactable this way
[11:30:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: its not that there are pepole that are non interactable, its just that our culture says we should ignore everyone outside our known group of people

[14:44:10] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I was talking of some strange abth houses they have in Japan, which contain Raidon, which is radio active
[14:44:25] <Cryowolf> that's just dangerous
[14:44:25] <amigojapan> bath houses
[14:44:46] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I see, apparently they come form Germany tho
[14:45:00] <Cryowolf> makes me think of early 1900s when they thought radium cured all disease
[14:45:03] <Cryowolf> same with mercury
[14:45:16] <Cryowolf> when it actually just slowly kills you (or fast)
[14:45:19] <amigojapan> ah I see

[14:46:29] <Cryowolf> I'm well aware of the existence of radiation therapy. I never got it, I only got the chemo

[14:59:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well at least in the West a lot of malls are dead nowadays
[14:59:07] <DunceCotus> because of online shopping etc. I guess
[14:59:13] <amigojapan> ah
[14:59:33] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I thikn Japan is still using both, well we also still ahve DVD rental shops
[14:59:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but also because of certain corporate ownership schemes to stymy local competitors moving in
[15:00:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its probably different there due to the proximity of stores to residences
[15:00:19] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there is something fun about going to the mall, which you lose if all you do is only shopping onlilne

[15:11:53] <darkwitch> like iodine in the thymus. some people were really worried about that after they started attacking the nuclear power plants. drug stores sold out all the iodine pills
[15:12:43] <amigojapan> darkwitch: how does iodine help?
[15:13:09] <DunceCotus> darkwitch: right, malls are now targeted to rich people I find
[15:13:21] <DunceCotus> a lot more luxury goods stores, less working-class focus
[15:13:31] <DunceCotus> less focus on social aspect of malls
[15:14:04] <darkwitch> it's a taken to avoid the body absorbing radioactive iodine from a nuclear plant, should it start "leaking"

[15:53:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: everyone in both coyboy bebop and whats the name the anime with vash, those wre all adults
[15:53:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: child-like adults
[15:53:57] <amigojapan> ok ok DunceCotus
[15:54:10] <DunceCotus> to depict actual adults means dullness
[15:54:21] <DunceCotus> stagnation, disappointment
[15:55:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Ergo Proxy does have a loli character but she is just a side character,, thos eadulst are pretty serious
[15:55:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: and its also dull
[15:55:36] <amigojapan> what,I love thta anime
[15:55:42] <DunceCotus> hmmm
[15:55:52] <DunceCotus> tbh I've only seen like the first episode
[15:56:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it only gets good after episode 14
[15:56:19] <darkwitch> many superheroes are adults but that concept would not work for anime
[15:56:38] <amigojapan> darkwitch: there are anime super heroes
[15:56:46] <amigojapan> one punch man is one
[15:56:47] *** Quits: codebam (~codebam@user/codebam) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:56:53] <darkwitch> amigojapan, and how old are most of them?
[15:56:58] <amigojapan> Sailor Moon is a heroine, ( tho not an adult)
[15:57:09] <amigojapan> one punch man is an adult
[15:57:23] <amigojapan> I have not watched much of that show tho
[15:57:39] <amigojapan> too shounen for me
[15:58:40] <amigojapan> darkwitch: you have like League of Justice anime,,,, does that count?
[15:58:49] *** Joins: codebam (~codebam@user/codebam)

[15:59:07] <amigojapan> yeah that one
[15:59:43] <darkwitch> it sounds like an outlier
[15:59:44] <amigojapan> darkwitch: bunny and tiger is a super hero anime too and they are adults
[15:59:53] <amigojapan> you guys make me think
[16:00:05] <darkwitch> there are always exceptions
[16:00:10] <amigojapan> ok
[16:00:34] <amigojapan> darkwitch: one of hte problems is that anime gets caught up in trends, like schools anime and isekai
[16:00:49] <darkwitch> overall, it's very non-adult oriented
[16:01:11] <amigojapan> yeah that was so mainly becuase it had to be all about schools kids
[16:01:42] <amigojapan> isekai has changed that trend somewhat
[16:02:00] <amigojapan> but we are back to a trend, a formula
[16:02:52] <amigojapan> anime needs to drop the formulas some day, I hope
[16:02:55] <amigojapan> and be original
[16:04:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I guess you would find the anime called fune wo amu very very boring, it is about makign a new dictionary
[16:04:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: over the span of 10 years
[16:05:14] <amigojapan> the production work behind makign a dictioanry by hand, withought computers
[16:05:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that actually sounds interesting

[16:06:08] <DunceCotus> I don't mind animes with adults if its an interesting concept
[16:06:12] <amigojapan> that is an anime that really needede a lot of episodes
[16:06:24] <DunceCotus> like Ghost in the Shell is all adults but good concept makes them not-dull
[16:06:30] <amigojapan> ah ok DunceCotus, so we need more animes with interesting concepts
[16:06:40] <amigojapan> alright
[16:06:49] <DunceCotus> I guess Death Note too
[16:06:56] <DunceCotus> even though main character is technically a teen
[16:07:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: and Cowboy Bebop is meant to be good
[16:07:29] <DunceCotus> though I think they're more child-like adults
[16:07:39] <amigojapan> its good, tho nto as good as people remember it

[16:12:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so rich in its imagery

[16:14:34] <amigojapan> alright DunceCotus, i like dthe synopsis...
