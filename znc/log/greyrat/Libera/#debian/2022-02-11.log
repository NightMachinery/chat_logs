[00:30:39] <gumbo> i was told to file a bug report if you want to see some software on debian something like an RFP are these high priority or how does it work?
[00:31:16] <sney> it goes to a mailing list that all of the debian developers see
[00:31:50] <PerfDave> gumbo: RFP is a "Request for Packaging", it's handled like other Debian bugs. If somebody wants to take on the work as a result of seeing your bug, they will. Or you can try packaging it yourself - there's a lot of help for new maintainers.
[00:32:03] <sney> so if one of them is interested in the software, or it's a python module or something that's easy to add to an existing workload, it can easily get added.
[00:32:03] <jelly> !rfp
[00:32:04] <dpkg> Request For Package (RFP) is the way to ask for a piece of software to be included in Debian.  See http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp, the section on that page "Adding new entries with "reportbug"" is a good place to start.  Technically, a RFP is a wishlist bug filed against "wnpp" with a title beginning "RFP: ", ask me about <wnpp>.  The best way of getting software packaged is to do it yourself: ask me about <nmg>.
[00:32:42] <sney> but yes, the best person to maintain a package is someone who uses the software, and if you're asking for something you use to be packaged, that could easily be you.

[00:34:00] <jelly> brave has at least some non-free components I think
[00:34:49] <PerfDave> Most browsers packaged in Debian have some non-free components in their upstreams :)
[00:34:52] <duckgoose> pft
[00:34:59] <duckgoose> foss purists are the worst
[00:35:17] <sney> the issue with brave being packaged for debian has always been that nobody seems willing/able to do it
[00:35:30] <PerfDave> The DSFG is a practical consideration if you want to package something for Debian :)
[00:35:34] <sney> if some component needs to be disabled or put in non-free then that's on the table
[00:35:47] <sney> but that point hasn't even been reached :P
[00:35:57] <ShorTie> nobody wants the responsiblity of "micropayment features"

[00:37:30] <gumbo> ok thanks all

[00:40:11] <jelly> brave has a built-in ad blocker, and some other stuff that I didn't like but I forgot what it was

[00:50:20] <shush> Or has the API changed ?
[00:50:43] <somiaj> it has been a transitional package for a while, and they have now removed the transitional package since the transition has passed.
[00:50:59] <shush> This sounds great
[00:51:05] <somiaj> check the changelog for debhelper for some more details on this
[00:51:45] <shush> Forgive my lack of familiarity here, but does this mean that the tools included in dh-systemd are to be installed so long as debhelper is installed?
[00:51:57] <shush> s/tools/bins
[00:52:18] <somiaj> kinda, but part of this was not needing these systemd specific tools and to integrate what is needed into the debhelper tools
[00:52:27] <somiaj> Maybe an XY problem here, what is in this package you need?
[00:52:57] <shush> What is an XY problem?
[00:53:02] <greycat> I'm envisioning "someone else made this thing for me, and ..."

We suspect you don't, so why don't you back up a bit and tell us about the overall objective...

[00:53:29] <somiaj> you are needing the package dh-systemd but not stating why, what about this package do you need that debhelper cannot do.
[00:53:40] <shush> I unfortunately don't have much context to the requirements to this docker sense this is a 3rd-party's. But I shared the Dockerfile showing what dependencies are required

[03:18:32] <n-iCe> It's atheros qualcomm
[03:18:39] <somiaj> n-iCe: In this case, the non-free iso has all firmware debian ships, so you could just boot it up and see if you can get the network online
[03:19:01] *** alMalsam1 is now known as alMalsamo
[03:19:10] <somiaj> newer atheros requires firmawre, some specific models don't. Anyways, the network part comes up before you do any actuall install, so I would just boot the iso and test
[03:19:56] <somiaj> probably easier than tracking down the chipset. Some devices you can find the chipset in the device manager, and I think there are third party tools that can help get chipset info in windows.

[04:45:45] <somiaj> foul_owl: this is a known issue with windows fast boot, I found I had to run a command line option in cmd to fully disable fastboot
[04:46:05] <somiaj> !fast boot
[04:46:05] <dpkg> Windows fast startup is enabled by default and will interfere with a dual-boot linux installation, and risks damaging the Windows filesystems during dual boot.  Disable it with the instructions here: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-windows-10-fast-startup   See this section of the bullseye installation guide: https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/ch03s06.en.html#disable-fast-boot
[04:46:30] <somiaj> Initially it was mostly about ntfs, but more and more people are reporting issues with it and wifi devices

[18:13:47] <jelly> bodom, well if your system is supposed to booti in EFI mode, you'll want to make the partition table GPT format, make a small EFI System partition (type ef00), say 100-200MB, make a VFAT filesystem on it, then make linux partitions and follow the install guide
[18:14:38] <bodom> thanks, i'm going this way with deboostrap. Was hoping to use the nice lazy giu :D
[18:14:42] <jelly> when you come to the point of installing the boot loader within the deboostrapped, chrooted new installation, you'll install grub-efi
