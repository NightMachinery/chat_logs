[01:50:38] <mooff> yes, they implemented a bad version. stubbornly. in my humble opinion, from the outside.
[01:50:55] <xnaas> I was fine with the bad version. It did all I wanted, really. :P

[01:56:36] <xnaas> out of normies
[01:56:43] <mooff> xnaas: it was released around the time of that iPhone.
[01:57:00] <mooff> i thought it looked great on all platforms, and especially desktop, from that codebase
[01:57:43] <mooff> i'm only assuming it's an html application. it could even be an Objective C one. but in principle that was do-able at the time with html5 thanks to app-region: drag;
[01:58:07] <mooff> and the ability for an app with Electron to therefore be completely chromeless, except what was (delightfully) drawn by the application
[01:58:49] <xnaas> I'm trying to get the dev of an abandoned game to release (at least some of) the source code for an old HTML5 game they shut down forever ago.
[01:59:04] <xnaas> Empire Attack was probably my favorite idle-ish game ever tbh
[01:59:11] <mooff> is it in the wayback machine archive?
[01:59:12] <xnaas> (website still exists, but game is dead)
[01:59:19] <xnaas> the problem would be the server-side, I think
[01:59:21] <mooff> ah, you need the server source code.
[01:59:22] <xnaas> since it was multiplayer
[01:59:25] <xnaas> yeah
[01:59:52] <xnaas> I've reached out twice, but all I've gotten is: "I passed it on to the programmer, but I guess he isn't interested if he hasnt replied.

[01:59:55] <xnaas> 😢 💔
[02:00:12] <mooff> i tried contacting the developer of likely the first irc poker bot, an oddly popular one, to try and archive the source for it, if not revive it
[02:00:17] <mooff> no word back as of yet
[02:00:30] <mooff> cool. it's not so bad to send a reminder

[02:32:06] <xnaas> way to avoid the real question
[02:32:22] <xnaas> who cares how long wendy has been connected to libera; how long has she been alive
[02:32:35] <bookworm> not long
[02:32:46] <mooff> sure, but uptime is maybe more like time of day for a bot program
[02:32:52] <mooff> if they are constantly running, that is
[02:33:08] <mooff> maybe some will rest, retrain, regurgitate and have dreams :)
