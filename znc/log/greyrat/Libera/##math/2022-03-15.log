[05:49:14] <ski> you could also see that ⌜logᵣ (a∕b) = logᵣ a − logᵣ b⌝ is equivalent to ⌜logᵣ (a∕b) + logᵣ b = logᵣ a⌝, now if you give the name ⌜c⌝ to ⌜a∕b⌝, this becomes ⌜logᵣ c + logᵣ b = logᵣ a⌝, but ⌜c = a∕b⌝ means ⌜c⋅b = a⌝, so we get ⌜logᵣ c + logᵣ b = logᵣ (c⋅b)⌝, which is just the usual product rule

[07:22:39] <ppw> can the expression (a-1) mod 9 = b-1 be simplified?
[07:23:39] <somiaj> seems you are using mod to mean remainder, why not use it more as a relation.
[07:23:59] <somiaj> because (a-1) = (b-1) mod(9) if a = b mod(9)
[07:24:37] <somiaj> But when used as a remainder (like you wrote it), it is a bit trickier and you have to do tons of different cases.
[07:25:32] <ppw> got it

[11:31:54] <kakuhen> internet just cut out as i typed my response; anyway:
[11:32:00] <kakuhen> in the case Z/kZ can form a multiplicative group, 2^k all belong in the same equivalence class
[11:32:35] <kakuhen> im not sure how one defines "even integer" in Z/nZ in general since what you have are all equivalence classes
[11:33:30] <kakuhen> i.e. n is different from [n] in, say Z/5Z
[11:34:17] <zeroc00l0> Okay, I need to think about what you are saying.
[11:34:19] <kakuhen> by abuse of notation we write n∈Z/5Z; as for my earlier claim about 2^k beloning in the same equivalence classes, i think that is actually wrong so just ignore it
[11:35:39] <kakuhen> in short: im saying the question "is 2^k in Z/kZ an even integer?" is ill-posed, because you're asking if an equivalence class is an integer
[11:36:41] <kakuhen> you can probably rephrase the question as "does [2^k] always belong to [2] in Z/kZ?" but I think you disproved that earlier with the fact 8 = 3 (mod 5)
[11:38:31] <kakuhen> err sorry, this is assuming you vary the exponent and k; i'd have to think more about this to come up with a better answer

[18:41:10] <br1ck> My textbook has 2 theorems. The first is Lagrange's : Let G be a finite group and H any subgorup of G. The order of G is a multiple of the order of H. The second is : If G is a group with a prime number p of elements, then G is a cyclic group. Furthermore, any element a!=e in G is a generator of G
[18:41:27] <br1ck> I can understand everything except the last sentence
[18:41:48] <savask> e is the identity element, it generates a subgroup of size 1
[18:41:57] <savask> So it's not a generator, indeed
[18:42:05] <br1ck> Ok that's fine
[18:42:12] <savask> If you take any other element, it will generate a subgroup of size greater than 1

[18:51:20] <br1ck> so cant be cyclic multiplicative groups of prime order?
[18:52:13] <Decker> bildramer certainly depends on the noise; map libraryes like shapelib would represent it sort of as closed countour loops...  there's no reason an island couldn't be a band around the equator though?  so then it has 2 edges instead of 1?
[18:53:54] <bildramer> I'm asking about the math, really, and on a flat plane
[18:54:56] <bildramer> noise + threshold -> contours, and those contours have features whose complexity depends on the max/average/? height within the countour - is that really true or just a perception bias or does it depend on spectrum? how to make that formal?

[18:59:56] <Z-module> oh sorry, that's only if we take the group of *all* things coprime to m.  For each prime p, there is a some m and some number k with {1, k, k^2, ..., k^(p-1)}  having order p for multiplication mod m. But it's not the full group U(m) = (Z/mZ)^*

[19:00:09] <Decker> (well that's not a surface, line?)
[19:00:25] <bildramer> perhaps the question to ask is "why is raising threshold equivalent to picking a different scale"
[19:01:17] <Decker> because increase/decrease always adds included points or removes included points somewhat uniformly?
[19:02:02] <Decker> I dunno; hoping someone with a better math approach will pick it up :)
[19:03:18] <Decker> in a 1d case - presuambly you'd have some gaussian distribution of points - and changing the level adds more to the edges or removes from the edges

[22:06:17] <Batzy> Z-module: how are you doing
[22:07:39] <Z-module> kind of.  pi normally refers to the element map R -> R/I sending r to r + I, which is a ring homomorphism.  Here, the pi(J) is a "direct image" of a set, using that map:  pi(J) really means  {pi(j) : all j in J}, meaning  {j + I : all j in J}
