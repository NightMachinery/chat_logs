[05:49:34] <adrianb[m]> Hi all...  Is gnuradio hard coded to use a specific version of VOLK? E.g. GR 3.9 will always use VOLK 2.5.0 and can't be configured to use VOLK 2.5.1?
[05:53:32] <jsallay[m]> I have upgraded my version of volk without issue. You do need to rebuild gnuradio after the upgrade for it to work.
[05:53:49] <adrianb[m]> Ok, thanks!
[06:25:03] <muaddib[m]> anyone have a fix for this on a B210?
[06:25:03] <muaddib[m]> I'm tuning the LO, but these don't move. They track with the frequency adjustments. If I disconnect the antenna they're still there as well. I'm also running correctiq blocks to see if its' IQ imbalance.

[06:25:19] <muaddib[m]> * but these spurs don't move.
[06:32:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> This is RX or TX?
[06:34:28] <muaddib[m]> sorry, RX
[06:35:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> The gain control range is about 72dB and the lower 30dB is probably useless. The gain needs to be high enough to swamp the internal spurs.
[06:37:17] <muaddib[m]> oh ok, so these are just the AD9361 spurs?
[06:37:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Probably.
[06:38:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> Any broadly tunable receiver next to a bunch of digital stuff is going to have spurs. Inevitable as the sun rising.
[06:44:17] <muaddib[m]> I know around 35 something turns on or off. do you know what that is? happens on all my B2XX radios. noisefloor goes way down. 
[06:44:26] <muaddib[m]> it's a hard step though
[06:45:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> The AD9361 has weird gain setting.
[06:46:25] <muaddib[m]> these spurs also track with the gain
[06:48:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> Inject a -100dBm signal at high gain and look at the sour ratio.
[06:48:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Spur ratio.
[06:50:29] <muaddib[m]> i don't have a -100dBm signal source
[06:53:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> No handy rack of attenuators?
[06:55:22] <muaddib[m]> I'm at home. I have a few.
[06:55:36] <muaddib[m]> I have a 30 and a 10, but no calibrated signal source
[06:58:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> Dang.
[07:01:10] <muaddib[m]> yea, i don't have any kit like that at my house. I have plenty of zip ties, velcro and duct tape though
[07:01:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> Welp. If you’re stuck on Mars, you’re good.
[07:02:29] <muaddib[m]> haha
[07:03:12] <muaddib[m]> I just asked my wife if I in any way resemble Matt Damon. The answer was a very firm no
[07:04:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> I have a really old transceiver test set made by Marconi. Only goes up to 1Ghz. But I can ask it to go down to -100dBm when I want it to.

[07:16:48] <muaddib[m]> yea, sort of. that's just my last setting
[07:17:08] <muaddib[m]> but yes, i'm working on an adapter to feed USB demod data into JAERO from GNURadio
[07:17:13] <muaddib[m]> which I got working the other night
[07:17:55] <muaddib[m]> I'm also just testing out this NOOELEC L-Band patch antenna I got. But everything is getting brutalized by these 2 spikes
[07:18:25] <muaddib[m]> no point in even doing anything if there's 2 30dB carriers in the way
[07:19:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> This is with a external LNA or not?
[07:20:07] <muaddib[m]> these screenshots are terminated
[07:20:16] <muaddib[m]> but yes, I have an external LNA
[07:21:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> The JAERO signal isn’t large enough to swamp those spurs?
[07:21:11] <muaddib[m]> I just did a (visual) frequency sweep from ~700MHz to 5.8GHz. those 2 spurs are always there. they rotate around and get the worst at 1600MHz
[07:21:24] <muaddib[m]> nothing will swamp these spurs
[07:21:41] <muaddib[m]> the more gain I add the bigger they get
[07:22:10] <muaddib[m]> JAERO is downstream
[07:22:22] <muaddib[m]> so it doesn't swamp me, I swamp it
[07:22:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Sorry ACARS at 1.5G.
[07:23:08] <muaddib[m]> all good, no it's pretty low SNR
[07:23:17] <muaddib[m]> 6-10 dB
[07:23:31] <muaddib[m]> even then these spurs will cut the bit transitions into ribbons
[07:23:39] <muaddib[m]> muck the signal all up
[07:24:01] <muaddib[m]> I guess I could steer around them. just seems like this shouldn't be an issue. 
[07:24:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> Have you tried a different USB cable with more ferrites on it? Bare board or in an enclosure?
[07:25:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> Do the spurs change with sample rate and or master clock rate?
[07:25:47] <muaddib[m]> enclosuer
[07:25:50] <muaddib[m]>  * enclosure
[07:25:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> I use B2xx at 1.4GHz with 15MHz bandwidth and don’t see any spurs.
[07:26:00] <muaddib[m]> Its the USB that came with it
[07:26:08] <muaddib[m]> do you use the power supply with yours?
[07:26:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> No
[07:26:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> I’m not using two Channels or GPS.
[07:27:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> I have 35dB gain at the dishes and about 40m of cable.
[07:50:26] <muaddib[m]> theres no spurs at 1.4GHz
[07:50:53] <muaddib[m]> i tried  RXA TX/RX and RX2
[07:51:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> Huh. Clearly it doesn’t like you.
[07:51:31] <muaddib[m]> yea, sucks
[07:52:14] <muaddib[m]> I don't have another USB cable so i'll have to rule that out another way
[07:52:55] <muaddib[m]> s/way/day/
[07:53:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> Would be interesting to compare against a BladeRF 2. Which uses AD9361 and FX3 but with a different FPGA.
[07:53:29] <muaddib[m]> I also have a B205-mini
[07:53:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Not a whole lot different.
[07:54:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> But these things are often really sensitive to board layout.
[07:54:37] <muaddib[m]> just tried with the 205 spectrum is straight as an arrow 
[07:54:55] <muaddib[m]> i'll open this thing up, maybe I borked up putting it in the case

[08:14:02] <muaddib[m]> uploading video. you gotta see it in live action
[08:14:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> Classic waveguide effect. Carbon absorber on the inside may clear that up.
[08:15:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> RF design is black magic.
[08:16:10] <muaddib[m]> apparently so is making a case for a B210
[08:17:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> Any metallic enclosure is going to have propagation modes. Tiny wee signals that cannot propagate on the board itself radiate away. Except when they’re trapped inside a kinda resonant cavity.
[08:18:41] <muaddib[m]> so shouldn't the case for the B210 ship with a carbon absorber? which might as well be a space-modulator to me. never used one
[08:19:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> Just a chunk of carbon foam glued to the inside of the top lid.
[08:19:43] <muaddib[m]> I have a feeling that's not on the Ettus KB
[08:19:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> I’m surprised they didn’t do that. But since this is their low end device…
[08:20:44] <muaddib[m]> Well, given my recent experiences with their high end device...
[08:21:19] <muaddib[m]> this thing has the GPSDO installed, is there a chance that's mucking up the mojo in there?
[08:22:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> Could be that’s the source. Easy experiment. Although it’s hard to removed and replace. Got a sticky pad and the pins are teensy.
[08:23:29] <muaddib[m]> this is a drop-in. dip-sockets
[08:23:33] <muaddib[m]> yup!
[08:23:34] <muaddib[m]> that was it. 
[08:23:40] <muaddib[m]> spectrum is now perfect
[08:25:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> Wow. I’ll send a note to R&D. Adding a chunk of absorber on the top lid shouldn’t be that much of a heartache. He says. Naively. 
[08:27:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> The pre filter carbon foam used for HEPa air cleaners is almost as good as the real thing btw. Coupe layers of that and then some Saran Wrap to keep bits of it from falling off towards the circuit board.
[08:29:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> In the olden days when wavelengths were considerably longer that any enclosure dimension, you didn’t have to worry about waveguide effects.
[08:33:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> I’ve had high gain LNAS get kicked into oscillation in one enclosure and not another.

[19:51:41] <muaddib[m]> I designed an aluminum shield for the SBX daughterboard in autoCAD back in 2012. Fully enclosed all the components. Measurements were positive. If I had put fins on it, It’d look exactly like the UBX
[19:54:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: Indeed when the enclosure is "close", there are no dimensions that can suppport waveguide propagation.  This has to be balanced against thermal issues, and changes to microstrip line impedance caused by the proximity of the enclosure.  No free lunches.

[20:37:59] <muaddib[m]> Ugh. 30dB at 1500/1600 mhz

[21:16:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: Not wonderful.  I've sent a note to R&D--who knows whether it will be addressed.  Of course "30dB out of the noise" on a modern receiver means it's still tiny, with narrowband MDS at max gain being perhaps -140dBm.
