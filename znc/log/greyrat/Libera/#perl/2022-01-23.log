[02:23:28] <Curiosa> can Perl parse C headers files to provide binding to any library?
[02:24:53] <superkuh> If so I wasted a lot of time in the past.
[02:25:32] <Curiosa> People at Hurd said so
[02:25:36] <aquanight> perldoc: h2xs
[02:25:37] <perlbot> aquanight: Your documentation is available at: https://perldoc.perl.org/h2xs
[02:25:42] <aquanight> Curiosa: ^

[02:25:54] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Dropping gdc support? ]
[02:26:25] <Curiosa> Wow
[02:26:31] <Curiosa> It’s real
[02:27:41] <zgu> yeah that must be a reference to h2xs
[02:27:47] <aquanight> keep in mind that like any automated tool, it can be overly naive sometimes. It is always a good idea to review the output for mistakes.
[02:27:55] <zgu> i don't think it's really a recommended method anymore though
[02:28:21] <aquanight> h2xs can make for a good starting point, but it's best to ultimately design your own API mapping between perl and the native library
[02:29:11] <aquanight> for example, in C it can be common to need to use argument patterns such as 'char* output_string, size_t available_output_space'
[02:29:19] <Curiosa> I think the Hurd guy has problems with languages written in something that is not C
[02:29:58] <Curiosa> Those language cannot have extensions that just work on any system
[02:30:00] <aquanight> a proper perlification of this API should instead do what is necessary to determine the correct output length, then create a new SV* to put the output string into, then return said SV*, thus appearing to perl as a function that returns a string
[02:31:53] <Curiosa> aquanight people keep saying that ai will solve such tasks
[02:32:07] <Curiosa> Not gonna happen in the current cycle
[02:32:27] <aquanight> I think it's gonna be another maybe 10, 20 years before AI can take over software dev like that.
[02:32:42] <aquanight> After that of course is the singularity.

[02:49:33] <zgu> whatever API i2ctransfer(1) uses works on both the ras pi and USB adapter to read from this chip, for what that's worth
[02:50:56] <LeoNerd> i2cdev most likely
[02:52:04] <zgu> yeah and it seems to be using I2C_RDWR instead of I2C_SMBUS
[02:52:57] <zgu> unfortunately strace isn't smart enough to parse out any of the actual ioctl data
[02:55:19] <zgu> but D::C::A::LinuxKernel can't currently work with this USB chip apparently (either a limitation in Device::SMBus itself or the way it's called)
[02:55:55] <zgu> and the ADC chip i have works most efficiently in a read-without-preceding-register-address-write mode
[02:56:05] <LeoNerd> Mmm.. I'm intending to rewrite that sometime to use the i2cdev API directly, rather than going via Device::SMBus

[10:57:45] <rezhit> EvanCarrol, I'm using Moose to store some hashes into a array by the following code => "has foo => ( is => 'rw', default => sub { [] } )". also I use Parser::MGC to parse my own syntax that these two are in the same file/module. so I have "use Moose; use Parser::MGC" together. the problem is, when I wanna execute my module in another module by

[20:28:40] <pragma-> I'd have to run it through ptrace or something to block undesirable syscalls. A virtual machine lets the user execute any syscalls without me breakign a sweat.
[20:28:57] <pragma-> That's why I chose a vm instead of docker or podman.
[20:29:39] <buZz> pragma-: afaik its pretty hard to break out of modern namespaces 
[20:29:45] <buZz> but yeah i guess its possible
[20:30:21] <pragma-> buZz: this is intended for the #c channel here. they will be executing any arbitrary C code. can't really trust them! :)
[20:30:34] <buZz> hehe
[20:31:09] <EvanCarroll> pragma-: while true, it's pretty silly.
[20:31:26] <pragma-> how so?
[20:31:52] <rindolf> pragma-: gl
[20:32:15] <EvanCarroll> pragma-: containers do block syscalls with seccomp, they also block all root level permissions by default. the only method that makes them _less_ secure is they're vulenrable to a kernel-level esculation attack.

[20:39:55] <EvanCarroll> I mean write is a syscall, right? they would not be allowed to print without that.
[20:40:10] <EvanCarroll> They do block 80% of the malicious syscalls now though, as specified by seccomp
[20:40:17] <EvanCarroll> (the ones that lend to malicious use)
[20:40:20] <pragma-> Yeah, but if a fork bomb goes awry in the vm, I can just reset the vm to a saved snapshot and all's well again.
[20:41:20] <pragma-> I can block absolutely 0% syscalls with a vm and just revert the vm to a snapshot image if it times out or is using too much CPU for a certain period of time.
[20:42:09] <pragma-> I don't have to learn how to fiddle with seccomp or selinux. I just run everything in the vm and revert to a last-known-good-configuration snapshot if it ever times out.
[20:43:07] <pragma-> This lets the end-users compile and execute any code and observe the results.
[20:43:08] <EvanCarroll> and with a container it's done for you. that command I wrote above does the same thing.
[20:43:12] <pragma-> Hmm.
[20:43:45] <tm604> are you starting from an existing system? https://metacpan.org/pod/App::EvalServerAdvanced and geordi have a fair bit of prior art

[20:43:48] <EvanCarroll> podman run --rm (will delete the container after it's executed), --ti (opens an interactive tty) perl (is the image) /bin/sh (is the shell)

[20:44:23] <pragma-> tm604: geordi was around at the time and was a bit of an inspiration but I didn't use any of its code
[20:44:24] <EvanCarroll> when it's done the container gets removed. You have none of the overhead of the vm, and you don't have virtualize things (like your ethernet controller) to stop a root level user from flashing the firmware.
[20:44:39] <pragma-> I didn't want to use geordi because it was blocking SYS_fork and most other interesting syscalls.
[20:46:06] <tm604> for better-than-container security these days, I'd probably start with https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/ (or just offload to AWS Lambda if someone else is footing the bill)

[20:48:51] <EvanCarroll> Cool install podman and check out /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json
[20:48:55] <pragma-> I chose Fedora for the guest because Rawhide provides convenient and somewhat reliable access to bleeding-edge latest versions of packages.

I want the IRC users using the bot to be able to compile absolutely any C snippets and see the effects of doing so. If they compile a fork bomb or something malicious, the VM will time-out or use more CPU than usual and it will be reverted to a known stable snapshot. 
[20:50:45] <pragma-> This has been working pretty well for the last 15 years.
[20:50:59] <pragma-> I'm just documenting how to set up the VM at long last.

[20:59:04] <pragma-> tm604: oh, the network cable is unplugged in the VM. They can't use any networking.
[20:59:17] <pragma-> I use a virtio serial cable to communicate between the bot and the vm.
[20:59:56] <pragma-> Should probably update that to use a channel instead.
[21:00:02] <pragma-> But if it ain't broke...
[21:00:04] <EvanCarroll> pragma-: you don't have to think about it. ;) I'm just explaining how it works.
[21:00:36] <pragma-> EvanCarroll: Everything I've read about containers has told me that they're not as reliable and safe as virtual machines. I'm a bit leery.
[21:01:12] <buZz> imho they're more reliable, less safe
[21:01:14] <buZz> but w/e
[21:01:14] <EvanCarroll> They're more reliable, but theoretically less safe.
[21:01:15] <buZz> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:01:18] <pragma-> I've also done all this work to make the virtual machine effective and I'm not too keen on studying containers and seccomp and stuff. I just want to go look at the sunset, you know?
[21:01:57] <pragma-> Someone asked me to write up a document on how to set up the vm, and here I am.
[21:02:17] * pragma- sighs.
[21:02:31] <EvanCarroll> pragma-: you run all this perl code in the same virtual machine: If the virtual machine ever times-out or its heartbeat stops responding, PBot will reset the virtual machine to this saved snapshot.
[21:02:39] <pragma-> Yup
[21:02:56] <EvanCarroll> so what stops someone from hacking Perl inside the virtual machine and capturing everyone elses code?
[21:03:43] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[21:03:46] <EvanCarroll> Presumably you do this because tearing down a VM and building one back up is a heavy process, but with a container it's almost 0-overhead.
[21:03:47] <pragma-> The Perl scripts in the vm are stored in /usr/local/bin and the main script is launched as root but drops privs to a normal user to run the compiled code.
[21:04:02] <pragma-> The normal users cannot modify the Perl scripts
[21:04:15] <EvanCarroll> pragma-: so a root kit in that vm, can compromise the system for everyone?
[21:04:23] <EvanCarroll> With a container, that would not happen.
[21:04:52] <pragma-> I also keep the VM up instead of tearing it down for each command. This lets users create semi-permanent files. The files are lost only when the vm reverts to a snapshot. This has been useful very often.
[21:05:23] <pragma-> I simply issue a command to revert to a snapshot through the vm's monitor. No tear-down.
[21:05:56] <EvanCarroll> The hypervisor still has to set up another VM, right?
[21:06:08] <pragma-> Not that I'm aware of?
[21:07:40] <EvanCarroll> I think so. But I could be wrong.
[21:08:17] <EvanCarroll> Anyway, I would just consider trying it.. It should be easier, faster, safe, and more reproducable. And you can support other languages easier.
[21:08:31] <zgu> simcop2387 LeoNerd https://github.com/kc2zgu/device-chip-adapter-linuxkernel/commit/1e573cc9e6a439c051f1725ae09eb1f19e439f9c i rewrote the I2C part to use i2c read/write messages directly instead of smbus

[21:08:33] <EvanCarroll> Everyone has an official image on dockerhub.
[21:08:51] <pragma-> EvanCarroll: This is the `ps` output for the vm:  2522 libvirt+  20   0 2366076 991216   3912 S  11.8  16.6   2904:17 qemu-system-x86
[21:09:11] <zgu> it's enough to drive an MCP3428 ADC through an MCP2221 USB bridge so far. also tested on a pi 4 with its onboard i2c
[21:09:20] <pragma-> It has undergone several reverts already and it's still at PID 2522 with an uptime of 2904:17, seems like the same VM process to me.
[21:10:06] <pragma-> QEMU just loads the saved snapshot.
[21:12:12] <EvanCarroll> yeah, but that's qemu on the host not the hypervisor it's talking to, right?
[21:12:36] <EvanCarroll> doesn't qemu just send the instructoin to the hypervisor to do work?
[21:13:17] <pragma-> right. KVM is the hypervisor, I believe. 
[21:13:44] <pragma-> I'm not sure how the very low-level details work.
[21:14:07] <EvanCarroll> anyway, if it's not worth you're time that's 100% cool, but you may just want to check it out because it's soo simple the container method.
[21:14:11] <EvanCarroll> podman run -ti --rm -v /tmp/test.pl:/tmp/test.pl perl:latest /usr/bin/perl /tmp/test.pl
[21:14:14] <EvanCarroll> not setup required.
[21:14:17] <pragma-> Hmm.
[21:14:19] <EvanCarroll> That maps in /tmp/test.pl to the container and runs it
[21:14:29] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.228.242)
[21:14:47] <EvanCarroll> and you can run that command every time and get a totally new state with new namespaces, etc.
[21:15:21] <EvanCarroll> I'm not sure how you get your perl into the VM to run it, but whatever should be easy either way, -v is the volume mount you can also open a port to the container
[21:15:36] <pragma-> I'll play around with podman a bit later. Right now I'm trying to finish this documentation for that person that asked for it. I was looking for 3rd-party eyes on my doc to make sure it's not an incomprehensible chaotic mess.
[21:15:46] <EvanCarroll> all you need for the container method is a new kernel (with user namespaces) and podman 
[21:15:53] <pragma-> I'm certainly interested in making this a lot simpler with newer technology, indeed.
[21:15:59] <pragma-> But... later.
[21:16:10] <EvanCarroll> cool, cool give me a shout if you need any help.
[21:16:13] <pragma-> word

[23:40:26] <simcop2387> i'm doing a kernel upgrade to it tonight
[23:40:42] <aquanight> "An unprivileged user can use unshare(CLONE_NEWNS|CLONE_NEWUSER) to enter a namespace with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN" fucking what
[23:40:54] <simcop2387> i've deliberately left it open and not upgraded it for that vuln to see if anyone can touch it
[23:40:58] <simcop2387> aquanight: yea
[23:41:03] <aquanight> is that the bug?
[23:41:08] <aquanight> or is that just a thing on linux?
[23:41:16] <simcop2387> pragma-: with seccomp and my other stuff they *shouldn't* be able to
[23:41:36] <simcop2387> aquanight: essentially the bug is that there's a situation where you can make an unsigned integer underflow and it's used for bounds checking

[23:42:07] <aquanight> and presumably you can do shenanigans
[23:42:07] <simcop2387> a PoC will be published sometime next week which is why i'm doing the upgrade but have left it open for playing for a bit
[23:42:19] <aquanight> but what does this have to do with unshare?
[23:42:23] <simcop2387> aquanight: full priv escalation to non-sandboxed root
[23:42:40] <pragma-> >We currently have created functional LPE exploits against Ubuntu 20.04 and container escape exploits against Google's hardened COS.
[23:42:43] <simcop2387> unshare is the name of a tool for creating linux namespaces usually in bash scripts
[23:42:54] <pragma-> It escapes Google's hardened containers. This is why I'm still using a virtual machine.
[23:43:06] <aquanight> ok let me try this: why the fuck does unshare grant privileges
[23:43:14] <simcop2387> pragma-: i do both, and usually also have vlans involved to help isolate further
[23:43:36] <pragma-> Seems a bit overkill to use containers inside the VM, unless you mean you have the VM inside a container?
[23:43:38] * pragma- confused.
[23:43:47] <simcop2387> aquanight: because it was all added after the fact and while clean up has happened, there's a metric giga-*FUCKTON* of surface area around it
[23:43:48] *** Joins: krismatrix (~krismatri@38.80.149.51)
[23:44:36] <aquanight> okay I guess the point is that a process will be privileged inside the namespace but not outside
[23:44:45] <simcop2387> pragma-: i use the VM to have the main system and perlbot and my irc, and everything all together because it used to be on a VPS, and that lets me isolate it from my main network too.  the containers/namespaces in the evalserver are to isolate the evals from having side effects to the VM (or anywhere else)
[23:45:06] <simcop2387> aquanight: that's the idea, to let that happen, but it's nearly impossible to do safely still
[23:45:30] <simcop2387> it's also why the evals don't get root in their namespaces
[23:46:00] <simcop2387> the seccomp filters i use *should* prevent it but i'm also not 100% sure there isn't a way to cause it to happen still

[23:50:17] <xenu> 21:16 [libera] CTCP VERSION reply from pragma-: This is nc from the netcat-openbsd package
[23:50:19] <aquanight> simcop2387: ah so it's a memory corruption exploit. If I even understood 1 thing about how to abuse such a thing I might give it a try.
[23:50:20] <xenu> pragma-: liar
[23:50:24] <pragma-> lol
[23:50:41] <pragma-> xenu: CTCP TIME me
[23:50:48] <pragma-> I have custom CTCP replies for just about everything
[23:51:00] <simcop2387> aquanight: yea, just being able to cause a crash of things in there should be fine
[23:51:03] <aquanight> but I assume you'd have to ... I dunno, trick the kernel into overwriting shit in god knows what locations to escape the sandbox
[23:51:53] <aquanight> I think you're in kernel memory space so I guess in theory you could dump zeros over everything and hardlock the system.
[23:53:12] <simcop2387> yea that's my expectation too
[23:54:43] <aquanight> hmm
[23:55:21] <aquanight> considering the proposed change
[23:55:37] <aquanight> if the attacker has control of 'size' and 'len' isn't there still an overflow possibility?
