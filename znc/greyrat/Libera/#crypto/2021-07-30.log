[16:55:37] <riv> oh, how is it better called?
[16:57:11] <ms7821> well, I'm not sure there's a specific term for it, but it's basically the whole missing escaping/improper input validation area of weaknesses
[16:57:51] <riv> yeah i was thinking about this

[16:58:16] <riv> but the crypto approach tends to prefer netstring style length prefixes
[16:58:31] <ms7821> a canonicalisation attack is where there's a canonicalisation step (e.g. a URL, or encoding as XML)
[16:58:37] <riv> which achieve the same goal but let you avoid having to process the encrypted data (e.g. to add backslashes)
[16:58:47] <ms7821> "the crypto approach" doesn't, this author does
[16:59:35] <riv> at its root, it's about making an encode function injective. so encode(a) = encode(b) can only happen if a and b are equal
[17:00:23] <riv> s/encrypted data/unencrypted data/
[17:00:35] <ms7821> a and b are equal in this case, it's caused by designing a protocol where a is ambiguously generated
[17:00:51] <ms7821> which is like the opposite of a canonicalisation attack
[17:02:11] <ms7821> (which is due to a being ambiguously representable)
[17:02:40] <riv> no a and b would be distinct pairs of strings that concatenate to be equal

[17:03:15] <piou> Hmm... I can see why the author went with canonicalization here, even though there's not really a canonicalization step you do have different inputs that are encoded to the same thing before being passed to hmac in this case. But I wouldn't have choosen that word.
[17:03:39] <ms7821> riv, the concatenation is the problem, not the encoding (encrypting)
[17:03:51] <riv> the concatenation is the encoding

[17:04:07] <ms7821> oh OK I see what you mean
[17:06:16] <ms7821> combine(a,b) cannot equal combine(c, d)
[17:09:18] <ms7821> whereas in a canonicalisation attack you'd have canonicalise(a) equals canonicalise(b)

[21:38:56] <caveman> from my understanding, pow is the cpu powers doing a majority voting.  doing double-spending of past entries is too hard (each added block increases difficulty exponentially).  but doing double-spending in the present time because easy if the majority votes so.
[21:39:23] <caveman> s/because/becomes/
[21:41:12] <ms7821> not necessarily. if you have the power to maintain a parallel chain, you can do that for an extended period of time. it's just more expensive to do so
[21:42:18] <caveman> not necessarily?  re: too hard (due to exponential complexity increase by added blocks)?
[21:43:58] <int-e> It's the 50% attack; if you have more than half the processing power and devote it all to rewriting history, you'll eventually be able to rewrite as much of it as you like. (Though if you're rewriting too much of it, people will probably start hotpatching clients to reject your new reality even though it's consistent)
[21:44:14] <int-e> (But that will happen outside of the protocol)

[22:21:01] <MacGyver> Correct me if I'm wrong, but the way in which you talk about double-spending implies a misunderstanding of what is actually *meant* by that term.
[22:21:16] <MacGyver> It's not that some amount of money is actually *duplicated* in the public record in the end.
[22:21:31] <MacGyver> Double-spending only makes sense in the present *anyway*.
[22:22:07] <MacGyver> Because it's literally the act of pretending to send one thing to two recipients, each of which believing they now have received their one thing.
[22:23:49] <MacGyver> Proof of work doesn't "defeat" double spending in that sense -- hell, it's trivial to send out two transactions from the same base state. The point is that only one of those transactions can end up in a block at the same time (there's no "voting" on ambiguity), rendering the other transaction invalid.
[22:24:36] <MacGyver> Proof of work serves to avoid the *other* transaction *becoming* the valid one later, invalidating the previously accepted one.
[22:25:43] <MacGyver> It's all just merkle trees and the only thing proof of work *really* does is ensure there's a longest chain that's pretty much accepted as the "truth".
[22:27:29] <caveman> fortunately that's what i meant.  i see why my wording was bad.  thanks for pointing this.  i was lucky this time as i wasn't that wrong (i could be that wrong any time soon.  one must keep a very close eye :-p)
