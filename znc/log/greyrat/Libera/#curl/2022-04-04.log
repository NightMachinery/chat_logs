[11:16:06] <rustyrocket> I have a weird bug with curl (or maybe the bug is on the server side), and I don't quite know what is going on.
[11:16:26] <bagder> tell us!
[11:16:41] <rustyrocket> I have identical code running on two different machines.  (Let me go and find the exact command I'm sending.)
[11:17:28] *** Quits: cuhela (~cuhela@188.119.45.227) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:23:06] <rustyrocket> https://pastebin.com/KNkxsVD6
[11:23:33] <rustyrocket> Top machine is a linux machine, running on AWS. Second machine is macos.
[11:24:24] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[11:24:28] <rustyrocket> Oh, and one more thing: This server has been giving me incorrect information. For example, trying to access without a valid cookie was giving me a 404 error or something like that.
[11:24:54] <rustyrocket> So anyway, the two machines give different results. Is the server doing IP filtering to prevent people from using AWS proxies (seems weird, but maybe?)
[11:25:29] <rustyrocket> Also, the error message on the linux machine is saying that curl sent them a 100-continue expectation, but only a 100-continue expectation is allowed? (?????)
[11:25:31] <bagder> that pastebin URL doesn't work for me
[11:26:15] <rustyrocket> https://pastebin.com/DDf4R3ht
[11:26:30] <rustyrocket> Pastebin is deleting my pastes for whatever reason.
[11:26:32] <bagder> "This page is no longer available"
[11:29:03] <rustyrocket> https://bpa.st/4CZQ
[11:29:58] <rustyrocket> (In both cases, the command is being directly invoked by a python script, so there's no issues with quotes or anything between the two shell environments)
[11:31:24] <bagder> these are two different curl versions?
[11:31:54] *** Quits: TheAssassin (~TheAssass@newpipe/theassassin) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:32:14] <rustyrocket> Seems so.
[11:32:31] <bagder> You could drop the "Expect:" header and it might work better
[11:32:34] <rustyrocket> curl 7.77.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin21.0) and curl 7.68.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
[11:32:58] *** Joins: TheAssassin (~TheAssass@newpipe/theassassin)
[11:33:14] <bagder> the command lines are also a bit "fragile", but maybe you want them generated like that
[11:33:38] <bagder> for example they include "Content-Length" and -X POST, both of which I would not recommend
[11:35:04] <rustyrocket> Yeah, I was worried about that. python is handling the Content-Length header (probably better to let curl handle that). What's wrong with "-X POST"?
[11:35:19] *** Joins: uid_max (~samw@host86-153-237-179.range86-153.btcentralplus.com)
[11:35:38] <bagder> it will trip you up if you for example add redirect following, -X POST is implied by --data
[11:35:46] <bagder> sorry, POST is implied by --data
[11:36:24] <rustyrocket> So you're saying if I were to simply delete the -X POST and -H Content-Length parts, curl would just do it automatically?
[11:36:29] <bagder> yes
[11:36:47] <rustyrocket> (for reference, I got the command by going into safari, loading the page, and then clicking "copy curl command", which has all that stuff in there.
[11:36:49] <bagder> "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" as well
[11:36:56] <bagder> sure
[11:36:58] <rustyrocket> I've been slowly adjusting the command to try to make it work.
[11:37:10] <bagder> but those copy-as-curl in browsers do that, they're far from perfect
[11:37:17] <rustyrocket> It was great until it quit working today. (I think they possibly pushed updates on 4/1, which is a new fiscal year in Japan.)
[11:37:24] <bagder> ah
[11:37:45] <rustyrocket> I don't see how to drop the 100-continue parameters easily, and google also isn't quickly giving me an answer.
[11:37:46] <bagder> try -H "Expect:" to prevent curl from sending an Expect header
[11:37:59] <bagder> ie nothing on the right side of the colon
[11:38:01] <rustyrocket> "Expect:" like that with just nothing after the colon?
[11:38:06] <rustyrocket> Gonna try it.
[11:38:50] <bagder> your more recent version doesn't send it because the POST body is too small
[11:38:57] <bagder> we bumped the limit at some point
[11:39:17] <rustyrocket> Okay, -H "Expect:" fixed the issue.
