[00:49:30] <gerikson> I'm seeing quite a lot of people here being quite tolerant of 4chan

[19:15:50] <edm> Next to berry bros building
[19:20:12] <gerikson> ok I moved a pane from one tmux session to anohter
[19:20:17] <gerikson> I feel a bit mad with power
[19:27:35] <edm> Oh wrong channel about texan republic sorry molluscfolk
[19:33:10] <bradfier> I know that plaque edm
[19:33:13] <bradfier> Good shop
[19:33:38] <edm> Yes there are worse shops for sure
[19:34:19] <edm> Going to grab a bottle of fizz when i go past again later
[19:35:35] <bradfier> Uncorked is my other
[19:35:43] <bradfier> Or was when I actually went to the office
[19:40:04] <edm> bradfier: walking in that direction later
[19:40:11] <edm> Hawksmoor with some friends
[19:41:06] <bradfier> Uncorked -> Hawksmoor on a monday evening was a good route
[19:41:09] <bradfier> 5 quid corkage
[19:41:27] <edm> Sadly 25 on a thursday!
[19:41:47] <bradfier> Indeed
[19:41:49] <edm> But that’s still not crazy given their wine list and I’ve got something fun to have
[19:42:14] <bradfier> Plus there's always the chance they'll accidentally give you a Le Pin for 45
[19:42:44] <edm> They forgot to charge me once
[19:42:48] <edm> For the wine
[19:43:11] <bradfier> Was it something halfway decent
[19:43:23] <edm> Gevrey chambertin!
[19:43:33] <bradfier> I'd take that!
[19:44:57] <edm> We just through our cards at the bill like a pair of awful city boys and said ‘just split it down the middle’ then ran out
[19:46:15] <bradfier> You must have felt exceptionally oily afterwards
[19:46:29] <edm> It was not something i would do today
[19:46:44] <edm> But we were like 23 and broke
[19:47:32] <edm> And i have given them some money in the intervening decade
[19:48:55] <bradfier> I have yet to try Blacklock
[19:49:06] <bradfier> Which is reportedly the vue.js of steakhouses
[19:49:13] <bradfier> i.e. "It's better this time we promise"
[19:51:30] <edm> Lol
[19:51:45] <edm> In general I don’t really ever go out for steak
[19:51:56] <edm> It’s so expensive and i have a really good butcher anyway
[19:52:16] <edm> But it’s fun occasionally to just let yourself be looked after
[19:52:42] <bradfier> Indeed, especially somewhere like London where the 'location cost' is so high
[19:52:52] <bradfier> I prefer to go out for stuff I can't make myself, like sushi
[19:55:51] <prussian> ^
[19:56:15] <prussian> honestly this. I find eating at restaurants make me sick in general though
[19:56:21] <prussian> so I usually just outright avoid
[21:14:41] <ngoldbaum> ugh it’s 10:45 AM and it’s already 90°
[21:28:31] <prussian> this is why I wake up at like 4 and walk early
[21:28:34] <prussian> 4am
[21:36:42] <hoistbypetard> https://github.com/cdr/code-server is really growing on me. it's still VSCode, with everything that entails, which makes it about my 4th choice of editor if I'm on my PC. But for experimenting with a little web application from a tablet, it is very much fit for purpose.

[22:29:42] <bkero> DOes it bother you that the web version doesn't work with the marketplace for extensions?
[22:31:32] <hoistbypetard> the crew behind code-server has done a nice job of collecting the (FOSS) ones i care about, so not really. i suspect it would bother someone who really likes and knows the MS version more, though.
[22:32:19] <bkero> It just seems to me that the only benefit of wrapping all your code in a giant electron app is to take advantage of the multitude of extensions which make it worth the bulk, and without that a lot of the value proposition goes away.
[22:32:55] <bkero> "As a result, we cannot offer any extensions on the Microsoft marketplace. Instead, we have created our own marketplace for open source extensions. It works by scraping GitHub for VS Code extensions and building them. It's not perfect but getting better by the day with more and more extensions."
[22:33:23] <bkero> I love scraping github for things, building them, and running them
[22:33:44] <hoistbypetard> so the benefit here is that my tablet is unsuited for running a web server (though it's fine at running a browser) and using one of my preferred editors over ssh to the machine that is good at running the web server is not a nice experience on the tablet
[22:35:31] <bkero> Yep, sounds like you found something that allows you to code on something not fit-for-purpose for coding
[22:35:36] <hoistbypetard> this vs code derivative in a browser view, editing code on the web server is a much more pleasant and functional experience than any of the alternatives i have for doing this task on the tablet. it autocompletes things for the server environment and copies/pastes from other local native things much more reliably than anything i've found that runs on ssh
[22:35:45] <hoistbypetard> that's about the size of it
[22:40:56] <indigo> Having an IDE in the browser is awesome
[22:41:14] <indigo> Sit down at any computer and work on your shit
[22:43:17] <hoistbypetard> I didn't think it was going to work at all. It is much more effective than editing files in a local editor and scp-ing them up to the server.
[22:50:26] <indigo> hoistbypetard: Have you tried VSCode's remote feature?
[22:51:39] <hoistbypetard> Yes. This works and feels very similar to that but 100% within a browser
[22:52:00] <hoistbypetard> Had there been a native VSCode available for the tablet, I'd have installed that and used the remote feature
[22:55:28] <hoistbypetard> it even uses the same chrome the remote feature does to show where you're working https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lokLelb1/image.png
[22:58:56] <indigo> Nice
[22:59:20] <indigo> Too bad it's web. Web bad, Gemini good
[23:03:06] <jlindgren> imagine unironically using the web when gemini exists
[23:05:08] <riv> imagine using gemini (bloated) when gopher (minimal and good) exists
[23:06:01] <hoistbypetard> imagine using gopher when you can just telnet into an ftp server and read things that way
[23:08:17] <riv> woah
[23:09:29] <kirch> imagine using ftp when you can just go to the library
[23:18:16] <ngoldbaum> imagine using the library when all the truth you need is in the bible
[23:20:05] <riv> omg!
[23:21:50] <indigo> Lol, stackoverflow: "how do you convert a bool to text in C++" "use this boost function"

[23:22:24] <ngoldbaum> does boost still break their abi with minor version bumps?

[23:27:40] * riv read up on the concept of lexical_cast
[23:27:40] <riv> btw
[23:27:44] <riv> C++ is crazy
[23:27:51] <riv> i just found out subclassing doesn't do anything
[23:28:21] <riv> you define a method in a class A, redefine it in a subclass B, do A obj = new B(); obj.method it just calls the one from A :P
[23:28:34] <riv> you have to declare it "virtual" for actual inheritence to work
