[02:20:02] <zyk> lol, fair point
[02:20:03] <Cl0udNinja> some drives were overpowered and would burn right through the material
[02:20:04] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:20:10] <zyk> writing slower tends to help too

[02:20:23] <Cl0udNinja> some disks were so shitty they'd flake apart if you sneezed at their general direction
[02:20:25] <Hunterkll> writing slower helped with weaker / early drives 
[02:20:34] <Cl0udNinja> BUT MUH 52X SPEEDS
[02:20:40] <Hunterkll> or drives that needed more 'burn in' to read reliably
[02:20:48] <Hunterkll> round mid-2000s that was a complete non-issue
[02:20:49] <zyk> just thinking anything punchcard/cdrw/etc that's physically modifying the medium to store data is going to wear out reasonably quickly, right?
[02:20:53] <Hunterkll> unless you needed old ass shit to read it
[02:21:08] <Cl0udNinja> zyk, yeah, but you also have the issue with pretty much all storage tech
[02:21:15] <Hunterkll> zyk: the millipede shit could sustain hundreads of read/write cycles, which for flash memory cells at the time was amazing 
[02:21:34] <Cl0udNinja> flash/nand has the issue, but its failure limit is pretty high (million to 10 million in some cases)

[02:23:11] <Hunterkll> ah, apparently millipede could sustain around 100k erases with the old methods before they devised newer ones 
[02:23:22] <Hunterkll> compared to flash memory at the time that would be absolutely mind boggling
[02:23:46] <Hunterkll> I remember often doing mtd erases/sector mapping while formatting with say, jffs2 to route around bad blocks/cells

[09:46:37] <JollyRgrs> granted, i rarely had dates, but even just outtings with friends, that'd take priority, unless it was like a scheduled clan match or something
[09:46:48] <sd_> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> admittedly, it's way harder to get a date that play videosgames

[09:50:22] <DrZak> yes
[09:50:29] <JollyRgrs> i've seen plenty of not-rich couples where one is way hotter than the other

[09:51:42] <DrZak> a man can be with an incompetent woman, but a woman almost never can be with a man who is way dumber than her
[09:52:00] <JollyRgrs> that's b/c the man prob just wants sex and a clean house and for her to make him a sammich
[09:52:12] <JollyRgrs> women have higher standards on the avg

[09:52:52] <JollyRgrs> i feel like everyone is just saying "b/c science" and not making any actual statements, lol

[09:54:15] <JollyRgrs> i love my mom, but i did not seek out someone who was like her for marriage
[09:54:48] <DrZak> coz you will definitelly find out that you wife has either some mannerism like your mom, some approach to certain situations like her
[09:54:56] <JollyRgrs> not really
[09:55:09] <JollyRgrs> i mean, as you can with ANY OTHER two humans, sure
[09:55:15] <JollyRgrs> but for the most part they are very very different
[09:55:33] <DrZak> we like the comforting same old same

[09:56:16] <JollyRgrs> ... i don't know why you are trying to force me to say my wife is like my mom
[09:56:29] <JollyRgrs> again, had a fine relationship w/ both parents growing up... my wife isn't like my mom

[18:43:15] <JollyRgrs> b/c it's pretty obv. what "benefits" you could reap
[18:43:38] <JollyRgrs> and the HP elitebooks would also support it... b/c they are win10 and HP supports sending data to azure for autopilot
[18:43:41] <Hunterkll> if you're gonna receive them and then reimage them right away regardless then autopilot gets you nothing

[20:03:26] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> ansible is for those who got hate juju and puppet
[20:03:28] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> i wouldn't say terrible, but it's not the best
[20:03:33] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> and who doesn't hate juju
[20:03:33] <Rpifan> What all can I ask for? 
[20:03:34] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> fuck you for reverting my changes!!!
[20:03:35] <A-KO> "here let me wrap a bunch of powershell code into python and fuck you over with all of it."
[20:03:56] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> i hate juju
[20:04:07] <A-KO> Ansible for Windows is effectively just taking your .ps1 files and copying and pasting them into yaml files, escaping shit for python, and hope it works
[20:04:09] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> i mean, is juju still a thing even? i thought it was basically dead
[20:04:13] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> juju + ubuntu + openstack is bad bad bad bad
[20:04:16] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> hi sysadmins
[20:04:21] <JollyRgrs> i mean, basically it is just a very frail skeleton for writing your own windows config manager using powershell scripts, right?
[20:04:24] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> your a giraffe
[20:04:35] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> sorta
[20:04:39] <JollyRgrs> i mean "anything is a dildo if you try hard enough" i guess same for config mgmt
[20:04:40] <A-KO> JollyRgrs: I've been basing our shit entirely off of DSC config scripts directly
[20:04:46] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> ubuntu people, canocial love it. They recommend using juju for their clouds
[20:04:46] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> more of a job orchestrator
[20:04:48] <A-KO> I mean, that's basically what ansible is lol
[20:04:51] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> i identify as so LOL
[20:04:54] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> problem is, that it doesn't scale past 400 nodes
[20:05:16] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> a-ko where the hell you pick up DSC? i've been looking for more references and such, and they are real hit or miss
[20:05:18] <Rpifan> How much more money can I ask for and more vacation days? What else is normal to ask for? 
[20:05:30] <A-KO> onenerdyguy: I know powershell REALLY well so the MS docs were easy for me
[20:05:37] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> 400 nodes, including control planes, hypervisors, containers.. 400 is really easy to get to.
[20:06:26] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> i have a dumb question, i saw a yt video yesterday
[20:06:29] <A-KO> onenerdyguy: The only issue for me is structuring the config scripts so the team can work on them together on 'authoring machines'. That's not as easy as it could be, and I haven't figured out the best answer for that just yet.
[20:06:36] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> well thats my bit
[20:06:44] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> there was a dude with some stickers on his laptop like docker, vim, tux etc..
[20:06:47] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> I can write the manifests for days, but trying to get annyone else to look into it is a nightmare
[20:06:47] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> a bit.. a byte!
[20:06:51] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> where can u get em?
[20:07:04] <A-KO> oh that's not the issue for me--the issue is like, automatically importing all the resource modules needed
[20:07:09] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> go to a conference if you want them for free, or buy like a 100 from amazon lol
[20:07:12] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> @giraffe  https://www.stickermule.com/unixstickers

[20:07:27] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> lessgo thanks
[20:07:42] <A-KO> I considered tossing the config scripts into a module, publishing to nuget repos, and then setting required dependencies on the resource modules
[20:07:51] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> LOL
[20:07:51] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> REMEMBER, more stickers means you are a better sysadmin
[20:07:58] <A-KO> but then there's the infra/surrounding components needed for that.
[20:08:02] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah

[20:08:06] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> bonus points if its a mac covered in stickers.

[20:08:13] <A-KO> yeah

[20:08:53] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> and its a mac
[20:08:55] <A-KO> I also considered setting a #Requires block in the config ps1
[20:09:04] <A-KO> but that doesn't auto download the modules, it just complains you need them
[20:09:07] <estranger> unchecked use smart quote and dashes in system prefs
[20:09:08] <A-KO> and the error message isn't so great
[20:09:33] <A-KO> a #requires block in the .ps1 tries to import the resource, if it can't, the script ends in a terminating error

[20:11:47] <A-KO> no not svn--mercurial
[20:12:00] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> a-ko let me be more specific. They 'use' mercurial as in 'once a project is finished, we do the first and only commit'
[20:12:09] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> never used svn if it wasn't for downloading linux from scratch book

[20:12:54] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> their management has no interest in 'forcing the change'
[20:13:01] <A-KO> onenerdyguy: yeah signed commits are painful. I like to commit very often, usually after I"m done a block of a 'thing'. I'll commit changes. But signed commits with yubikeys and that are a pita
[20:13:17] <A-KO> and then there's the validation of commits--which isn't s ogreat in git

[20:29:12] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> you have a connectx-3 card in your desktop?!?!!?!?!
[20:29:16] <csws> yeah why not
[20:29:23] <A-KO> csws: I'm 99% sure it's a BIOS issue with some of these gigabyte bioses. I'm really, really not happy with gigabyte atm over this stupid nonsense. Their quality has dropped pretty substantially to the point that I might switch vendors next time I upgrade. I've been using gigabyte boards for 15 years. I've also narrowed it down hopefully to RAM settings. Like what I'm guessing is it 
[20:29:23] <A-KO> reboots, can't POST due to RAM settings, reset BIOS settings, then POSTs/boots. From what I saw in the BIOS, it looks like when I enable XMP it's actually keeping the RAM at 1.20 volt instead of bumping it to 1.35v, which would explain RAM stability issues.
[20:29:26] <csws> my core is 10gbe
[20:29:38] <A-KO> so I manually set it to 1.35v so we'll see if that keeps it stable. Right now hwinfo is reporting 1.38v, which should be fine.
[20:29:40] <JollyRgrs> technonerd: you just gotta change the OEM logo to tux and boom! done!
[20:29:42] <csws> fuck me A-KO mine is a gigabyte mobo too
[20:30:12] <csws> I just feel duped as my previous gigabyte board was from haswell days and it was so badly designed
[20:30:16] <csws> but thought meh maybe they sorted tehir shit
[20:30:18] <csws> but nope lol
[20:30:26] <JollyRgrs> @Arlion are you just bad at computers?

[20:30:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> Are you from the past?
[20:30:42] <A-KO> although I manually enabled 1.35v and it pushed it to 1.38v, which is behind like the +/- 5%. So we'll see if maybe THAT's the issue

[23:41:59] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> wfh does work
[23:41:59] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> no one questions that
[23:42:07] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> it's more 'does management/powers that be accept it'
[23:42:13] <sintax> and they're mostly older
[23:42:15] <fritzwastaken> I purposefully work harder at hom
[23:42:16] <yuken> I am VERY confused r/n
[23:42:16] <sintax> no offense to anyone
[23:42:16] <oxipital> this is a sign of how hollow the workers rights movement is
[23:42:17] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> until you get over the culture issue, you'll never be more than a whiner in their eyes
[23:42:22] <yuken> how did it not warn me that I already own a copy of Minecraft
[23:42:23] <PublicWiFi> WFH works for some
[23:42:24] <sintax> and don't know how to manage wfh employees
[23:42:26] <PublicWiFi> not all
[23:42:29] <yuken> what kind of shitty system do they have lol
[23:42:30] <iphone> I don't want to work from home
[23:42:34] <PublicWiFi> ^
[23:42:38] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you don't wanna work
[23:42:40] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> 😉
[23:42:42] <iphone> management sucks cock, and I'm lonely all day
[23:42:42] <sintax> lol
[23:42:42] <oxipital> the same one walmart has
[23:42:49] <oxipital> common sense.
[23:43:32] <oxipital> onenerdyguy, i may be whining but it doesn't really make the point invalid
[23:43:39] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> nah, it sorta does
[23:44:07] <oxipital> how so?
[23:44:22] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> what you've presented so far is nothing but anecdotal reports
[23:44:33] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> until we get more than that, it's just whining
[23:44:41] <oxipital> yes about my workplace and employer
[23:44:47] <iphone> onenerdguy you sound like a dick
[23:45:01] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> i am a dick
[23:45:04] <oxipital> however, production was actually up for wfh workers during covid
[23:45:05] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> i know this
[23:45:13] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> k, so that kind of thing: that's a measurable kpi
[23:45:38] <nobyk> Don't really want to work from home either tbh
[23:45:48] <nobyk> ngl the office is pretty chill
[23:45:54] <oxipital> i wouldnt mind hybri
[23:45:56] <oxipital> +d
[23:46:13] <iphone> wfm is nice as an option, but I'd prefer the office most days.
[23:46:13] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> personally, I'm fine either way. Work is work, can be done anywhere. I miss working in sweat pants some days, but I also miss the people around. But at the end of it, it's not my choice
[23:46:27] <oxipital>  because i don't mind going to the office if its the right type of environment
[23:47:06] <killdash9> but most offices aren't the right kind. Open workspaces kill productivity
[23:47:29] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> headphones
[23:47:31] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> problem solved
[23:47:39] <oxipital> this is a call center with 3 people per line of cubicles
[23:47:51] <nobyk> I don't think I have the dicipline to work from home if I'm honest
[23:47:57] <killdash9> yeah, problem solved. They totally keep people from walking up and interrupting your workflow
[23:47:58] <nobyk> I'd be doing what I think all the wfh folks are doing
[23:48:14] <oxipital> i actually worked better
[23:48:21] <nobyk> just watching videos and take naps
[23:48:30] <nobyk> download wiggle.exe
[23:48:31] <oxipital> i did my google seo thing and this job at the same time
[23:48:40] <oxipital> nobyk, i took naps too
[23:48:51] <oxipital> if i dozed off here, i'd be shit canned
[23:49:00] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> so
[23:49:06] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you did a second job and slept while on the clock
[23:49:11] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> and wonder why the bossman wants you in the office?
[23:49:12] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> 😉
[23:49:14] <killdash9> our company was so hard up to fill spots during pandemic that they hired several full-time WFH people in places that we have no office. So now the company has opened that box and can't really force people like me back
[23:49:19] <oxipital> unfortunately some of my kidney diseases cause drowsiness
[23:49:24] <nobyk> Also if it's a quiet time and I'm at home I'd feel guilty about not working
[23:49:39] <oxipital> onenerdyguy, yes and?
[23:49:52] <nobyk> but if I'm at work and it's quiet, well at least I'm still there and available, visibly
[23:49:55] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you don'ts ee the issue of, oh, idk, working a second gig at the same time?
[23:50:03] *** Joins: flood75 (~flood@131.153.135.146)
[23:50:06] <oxipital> guess what, i'm doing the second gig now too
[23:50:10] <oxipital> not really, no
[23:50:25] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> hmm
[23:50:32] <killdash9> if I can keep up with expected work and company doesn't fill my free time, that's on them, not me
[23:50:38] <oxipital> if i'm doing the job well then leave me the hell alone.
[23:51:04] <nobyk> What's the problem about it @onenerdyguy
[23:51:08] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> we have specific clauses in our employment agreements forbidding that kind of thing
[23:51:10] <nobyk> I'm not taking any sides but I'm curious
[23:51:26] <oxipital> oh well, sucks for you.
[23:51:33] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> For us, it's like "you're here, working for us for 40 hours a week, and not someone else"
[23:51:50] <iphone> I'm a contractor and if I don't work I don't bill my hours and I don't get paid. I would love to get paid for a nap 
[23:52:05] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> exactly
[23:52:11] <oxipital> i'm technically a contractor too
[23:52:15] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> You get paid to work, nto to nap, and not to work for someone else
[23:52:28] <nobyk> I see your point
[23:52:33] <killdash9> my daily 20 minute cat naps enable me to work longer. If I could get them at the office too it'd be good for the company
[23:52:34] <oxipital> the company i produce material for offloads all their hr andceveything on a staffing comnpany.
[23:52:56] <iphone> now, if a billing accident happens and I take a nap and forget about it and include that in my time worked, then thats different
[23:53:31] <nobyk> iphone: You work 100% of the time you bill?
[23:54:12] <iphone> nobyk: I bill for 110% of the time I work. I go pee, let the dog out, etc. But if I'm spending any brain energy on work, I bill for it
[23:54:46] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> but do you bill 2 companies for the same time?
[23:54:50] <oxipital> so theoretically, the company i work for cares so little about me that they have me on a one year contract with a staffing agency
[23:55:16] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> oxipital, man, you got a lot of justifications for things. I mean, you do you, but I coudn't do that ethically
[23:55:17] <sintax> keep looking
[23:55:18] <iphone> I'm not chad enough to bill two companys for the same time
[23:55:35] * oxipital shrugs
[23:55:36] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> exactly
[23:56:01] <nobyk> I think it's just how you look at it
[23:56:05] <sintax> i got out of the msp life and found a company to work for. now i do it all. i do miss kicking easy stuff to my level 1's but thats fine. i don't mind it. 
[23:56:07] <nobyk> they hire you, 40hrs a week to do x job
[23:56:12] <iphone> but I get paid $60 for my hour, the subcontractor I work for charges the client $240 and they usually have the money, so its not really an ethics thing
[23:56:12] <oxipital> i totally will not let the possibility of one company firing me/folding/whatever ruin me
[23:56:20] <iphone> give me a second company to bill to and I just might do it
[23:56:22] <nobyk> If you can do x job in less time, what's the harm of doing something else on the side?
[23:56:26] <nobyk> If x job is still getting done
[23:56:41] <nobyk> Could also loiter
[23:56:50] <oxipital> i started out in factories making $6 for work regular employees got paid 13 for
[23:56:51] <iphone> spend time on IRC lol
[23:57:01] <iphone> oxipital is probably billing this convo :D
[23:57:07] <nobyk> :D
[23:57:10] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> they  hire you to work for them for 40 hours a week, with primary duties duoign x
[23:57:13] <oxipital> being strung along with "well hire you full time, just not right noe"
[23:57:27] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> however, if youc an do x in 20 hours, find something else to do for the company, as they still have you for another 20 hours of time
[23:57:39] <oxipital> and if i do x in 32, then....?
[23:57:40] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> if that 20 hours is sitting on your ass thumbing your nose, well, thats now the job
[23:57:43] <iphone> oxipital: you wouldn't be a contractor if they wanted to hire you. they have no reason to. that's one of the main reasons I'm jumping ship
[23:57:54] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> if you do x in 32, you have 8 hours to find other duties for the company for hte pay they are already giving you

[23:58:02] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you have already sold that 8 hours. You can't sell it again
[23:58:06] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> thats my issue with it.
[23:58:06] <iphone> I can't get enough work most weeks. 
[23:58:23] <oxipital> you know if i coiukd just stoip working once i did enough of whatever, id be fine with that
[23:58:43] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> that is literally not how knowledge work works, outside of contractors
[23:58:49] <oxipital> but i can't do that because of..reasons
[23:58:50] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you sell your time and expertise
[23:59:00] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> they buy yoru time and expertise. you can't sell time twice
[23:59:30] <oxipital> its time theft.
[23:59:30] <nobyk> Well you ARE kinda scamming the 'primary' company
[23:59:34] <nobyk> sure
[23:59:48] <nobyk> That is unethical
[23:59:53] * oxipital doesn't deny thst. and objectively i know its unethical
[23:59:57] <nobyk> But you know what, if it's a big af company who cares
