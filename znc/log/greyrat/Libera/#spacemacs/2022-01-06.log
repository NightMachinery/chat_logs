[17:45:28] <FromGitter> <magicaltrout_gitlab> Hello fine spacemacs developers and users. Quick question just out of interest cause I can't get it to function and I'm starting to wonder if its me or it. Does anyone have the Go layer working with autocomplete on a reasonably new release of Golang?

[18:26:17] <FromGitter> <Sudakatux> Hello spacemacs developpers just pulled develop. Im impressed with the changes done to Typescript React support. Great Work!! i was trying to solve the integration for some time. and just pulled and everything  works great. Thanks a lot for this!
[18:43:47] <FromGitter> <truby:matrix.org> Hi, I'm trying to install the latest tramp from elpa rather than using the built in one as it has a fix for a bug I'm experiencing, but I can't get spacemacs to select that over the builtin version. Anyone have any pointers? Thanks!
[18:47:58] <FromGitter> <truby:matrix.org> I may have fixed my own issue actually... I added it to additional packages with :location elpa, which did nothing, but after doing that and installing it again with install-package, it doesn't get deleted anymore! So that seems ok
[18:55:04] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @magicaltrout_gitlab Do you mean 'with auto-completion' or 'with the auto-complete' package? I don't user the go layer, but so LSP is not working for you?
[19:23:12] <FromGitter> <magicaltrout_gitlab> Hey @dalanicolai I get various forms of syntax highlighting and stuff so in general the Go layer comes to life, and as far as I can tell I've forced it to use the lsp backend and uncomented the auto-completion block in the configuration layer but that then gives me: `Company: backend company-go error "GOCODE PANIC: Please check your code by "go build"" with args (candidates ...)`
[19:23:44] <FromGitter> <magicaltrout_gitlab> which from what I can tell is because company-go is depreciated and part of the older backend and doesn't work with go modules and stuff, but I can't figure out if its me or a configuration issue
[19:25:11] <FromGitter> <magicaltrout_gitlab> oh interesting I've just spotted `LSP :: myfile.go not in project or it is backlisted` further up
[19:25:23] <FromGitter> <magicaltrout_gitlab> wonder if its related, I'll see if I can figure that out
[19:28:11] <FromGitter> <magicaltrout_gitlab> ah ha! lol, oh well that was easy when I scrolled back in the errors
[19:28:15] <FromGitter> <magicaltrout_gitlab> problem resolved ;)
