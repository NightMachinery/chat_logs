[01:20:21] <Rashad> perhaps he felt weird that "Date", which is also a class in Java was in double quotations.

[05:01:23] <piou> Lyn: ok, sha1 for host and key authentication is indeed deprecated in SSH, and although it's not clearly broken yet it is definitely a good idea to deprecate it. However that's at the ssh level, so any other ssh client is going to also be affected. Maybe sshtray only support ssh-rsa keys with sha1 fingerprints? That's possible since the project is quite old.
[05:03:16] <Lyn> I don't care so much for sha1, but I'd like a 1-file program that I could safely use, e.g. with ed25519 (which also isn't supported on puttytray)

[07:03:55] <droid3> curious i realize some computers have more then 64 bit register sizes there some with 128  and 256 already. But where in the high level languages like c/c++ , java , python ,...etc do we have data type for bigger then doubles and longs
[07:04:31] <arahael> droid3: They're called arrays and structs. :) (Compound data types)
[07:04:54] <droid3> Its not like main stream but in assemblier you can just access directly the fma , avx ...etc
[07:05:50] <beaky> yes they have those as simd intrinsics

[07:10:17] <droid3> do languages just start using the declaration of Decimal128 , Decimalxxx ...? so like Decimal64 would same as double 
[07:11:04] <droid3> Because to me its not well know how to use these bigger registers from higher level languages. Sure if your working at the asm level or using /calling asm then you could.
[07:11:07] <webnet4> int128_t  for C probably
[07:11:28] <droid3> But most people i imagine just want to declare and use the big registers...
[07:11:53] <droid3> O int128_t but thats not a builtin type last i checked hummm must be some add-on
[07:11:54] <beaky> yes from those languages 'simd intrinsics' is the way to directly use those bigger registers

[07:17:52] <hans> PlanckWalk, well the 2 statuses "authorizing" and "revoking" are supposed to be very temporary statuses, but if they remain in that status indefinitely then the code would freeze (and eventually crash from call stack exhausted)
[07:20:21] <hans> i could add a timeout, but given that the api returning the statuses are maintained by a large competent team (the AWS team), i don't think it's worth the trouble

[07:35:01] <hans> Cloudflare had an interesting blogpost about it, how CF proxies got overall slower performance when AVX512 optimized code was deployed, so they removed the AVX512 code, and got higher overall performance (the AVX512-running cores were ruining performance for all other cores)

[09:39:06] <droid3> i would imagine its a int[] internally with the exact digits from your base10 number you gave it. But didnt know for sure. As the base affects the amount of space it takes up in memory
[09:39:45] <droid3> Like if you represented it or converted it to base64 say you save alot more space
[09:41:45] <droid3> Actually the most space saving way is if int[] is used then each element can hold up to 2147483647 aka the max size of an java int
[09:41:56] <Izem> seems like it uses two's complement

[09:45:02] <Izem> droid3 yeah, they also use byte arrays
[09:45:05] <droid3> are they using int[] and putting the binary representation of each decimal digit into it

[09:48:35] <droid3> internally at least 
[09:50:14] <Izem> use the source luke!

[09:51:54] <Izem> they use a bunch of different ways
[09:52:20] <Izem> and sure
[09:53:04] <droid3> perhaps that what there doing but also when it more efficient just convert it to a bit binary representation using the int[] to do two complement ...etc when its more efficient to do so.
[09:53:46] <droid3> then converting back to base2147483647 if need to compactify it/fit it.

[11:35:46] <chives> anyone used a debugger?
[11:35:57] <khanred_> I would imagine most people here
[11:36:10] <chives> was curious if there was an open source one or free one... well not one that is connected to your source code?
[11:36:33] <chives> was curious if i could figure out how to make the modifications to the original exe instead of the source?

[11:37:21] <deniska> debuggers can be helpful in reverse engineering, but without the access to source code they're much less helpful
[11:37:24] <khanred_> chives, Depends on the language it's written in. But you could look into "decompilers", it would be at least some place to start.
[11:37:42] <Akronymus> chives sounds like you are looking for something like ghidra

[11:41:51] <Akronymus> Does anyone know of the legality of reverse engineering a game engine to make a reimplementation?

[11:42:52] <Akronymus> Use a hexeditor?
[11:43:18] <chives> im already in one but idk how the conditionals changes look
[11:43:32] <Akronymus> what OS?
[11:43:36] <chives> i see a change in hex that i made... but have two questions about it...

[11:48:44] <chives> weird those because its toward the end of the exe i thought that stuff was toward the top

[11:48:50] <Akronymus> Is it bare metal code, or something like .net?
[11:48:55] <chives> though*
[11:50:00] <chives> i'm not sure... what makes it qualify as .net... i dont think its using any .net maybe? but i think they were building in visual studio its putty.exe

[11:50:33] <Akronymus> .net is a different instruction set as "just" a binary.
[11:50:46] <chives> i see it, looks like not .net i think... no CLR support
[11:50:52] <Akronymus> Basically, to elaborate on my question: does it require a runtime or does it just run?
[11:51:06] <Akronymus> Oh, putty
[11:51:21] <Akronymus> Written in c.
[11:51:28] <Akronymus> Should be bare metal
[11:51:36] <Akronymus> But is it on windows or linux?
[11:51:54] <chives> idk... it might maybe visual c runtimes?  thats one reason i wanted to just patch the old because i built it in 2019 but it was originally built in 2012 kinda would be dumb to need to install new runtime for a few bytes of changes
[11:52:30] <Akronymus> "a few bytes of change"
[11:52:42] <Akronymus> A few bytes can make a HUGE difference
[11:52:58] <Akronymus> But yeah, it should just use the x86 or x64 instruction set.

[14:12:06] <mrig> so unless you have a machine to play with, it is all speculation.

[14:12:13] <DnzAtWrk> umm, I guess the spin of the electron in the first place
[14:12:20] <DPA> I've a question regarding quantum cryptographic communication. Tapping a fiber is usually done by bending it strong enough so that some percentage of the light leaves the cable.
[14:12:20] <DPA> Transmitting data is never fault free. Light can get absorbet, which is why repeaters are needed over long distanmces.
[14:12:21] <DPA> Now I wonder, when some photons getting lost doesn't matter, then those photons loosing entanglement due to a measurement shouldn't matter either, so wouldn't any error / data loss correction / tolerance automatically result in the fibers / data being tappable again?
[14:12:22] <DnzAtWrk> so would the sensor itself have to rotate?
[14:12:25] <DnzAtWrk> I'd assume so
[14:12:58] <DnzAtWrk> otherwise what you are measuring is just the projection of the spin
[14:13:09] <DnzAtWrk> which is anything between perfect to off by 90 degrees then
[14:13:56] <DnzAtWrk> at least that's what I assume by common sense
[14:14:02] <DnzAtWrk> but quantum physics is full of not-common sense

[16:00:53] <pyzozord> I dug a bit deeper in to stterm code and sdl examples for rendering font with emojis. The stterm code seems simple enough to be able to get hold on in a week, and the SDL unicode font rendering is amazingly simple. I'm more optimisitc now that maybe I will be able to migrate stterm to SDL. It would be so cool.
[16:02:06] <pyzozord> After I have stterm on SDL I should get color emojis gratis by the fact of simply using SDL. But the first thing I will add after SDL is animated gif backgrounds. I need my terminal emulator have animated gif backgrounds.

[16:50:26] <mobidrop> merijn, I think conventional economists are brainwashed into thinking that inflation is great so we quietly accept the theft / devaluation of our wealth
[16:50:36] <merijn> mobidrop: Inflation isn't great
[16:50:40] <mrig> I need a whole new function just for my first node, seems extravagant!
[16:50:50] <Akronymus> How so?
[16:50:53] <merijn> mobidrop: You want minimal, but non-zero inflation to keep things going
[16:50:55] <Akronymus> The new function that is
[16:51:04] <mrig> Should the belly inflate or deflate?
[16:51:20] <Akronymus> It should slowly inflate.
[16:51:21] <merijn> mobidrop: You want it low enough for currency to stay relatively value stable, but not zero, to encourage flow/circulation
[16:51:36] <DPA> The main mechanism to make sure money keeps flowing is debt. The ability to spend more money than one has.
[16:51:41] <mrig> Akronymus: will end up a very fat animal and will then die of other causes.
[16:51:46] <mobidrop> merijn, I think that in a deflationary environment the flow / circulation will take on a more natural form that promotes quality products and services
[16:51:48] <merijn> mobidrop: You're also simplifying by implying that "producing stuff" is the only way money flows
[16:51:49] <mrig> catch a cold or something.

[16:52:13] <Akronymus> mobidrop hahahaha. No.
[16:52:17] <mobidrop> it doesn't need artificial stimulation through inflation
[16:52:43] <mobidrop> but that message is hard to get across in a society trained to be consumers
[16:52:59] <mrig> Akronymus: I'm trying to get around the clauses that my primary parsing function has, whist dealing with the special case of the first node, seems silly to check for it on every iteration.
[16:53:00] <Akronymus> Deflation eventually is gonna cause people to default on their debts.
[16:53:01] <merijn> mobidrop: The problem with that idea is that people who start with the most money win the most from deflationary currency
[16:53:10] <Akronymus> Which would lead to something like 2008
[16:53:12] <merijn> mobidrop: You can literally see this happening in the cryptocurrency sphere
[16:53:39] <mobidrop> merijn, right now the people closest to the money printers win the most
[16:53:52] <merijn> mobidrop: The people with the most money, earn the most benefit from deflationary currency, which will lead them to hoard even more of it and spend less on, say, employees
[16:53:56] <mobidrop> merijn, you can see a very sharp increase in wealth inequality after we got off the gold standard, I wonder why that is?
[16:54:16] <Akronymus> Fiat currencies are a mistake.
[16:54:18] <Akronymus> IMO
[16:54:26] <mobidrop> inflation increases wealth inequality way more than deflation would
[16:54:33] <Akronymus> No, not really.
[16:54:34] <merijn> Akronymus: Probably, but at least not as big as cryptocurrencies :)
[16:54:52] <mrig> money is good though, it gives the psychos something to think about other than directly lording over everyone which inevitably ends up in the plebs being served up on the dinner table.
[16:54:54] <davros> i think the increase in inqeuality is not due to the monetary system, rather technology
[16:55:12] <davros> more mass production  = more money for control of the few right designs

[16:55:53] <davros> its interesting that people advocate keynsianism as a solution to inequality, which is inflationary
[16:55:58] <Akronymus> Someone has to provide the capital for certain things. Like building a manufacturing hall, or funding research that the state has no interest in
[16:56:00] <sjmulder> POS has been 'just around the corner' for longer than Duke Nuken Forever ever was
[16:56:02] <davros> and people are also claiming inflationary money causes inequality
[16:56:18] <davros> keynsianism: a government can just keep printing and spending on services to keep people employed
[16:56:22] <pyzozord> There is this famous concept called Pareto Distribution. Better known as 80/20 rule. Turns out that distribution with ~20% holding to 80% of resources is what happens most situations with humans
[16:56:26] <mobidrop> there's literally a very strong correlation between inflation and wealth inequality
[16:56:28] <mrig> mobidrop: sure yes, same everywhere in the colonies origins world.
[16:56:33] <davros> its inflationary and erodes savings , it redistributes into workers hand
[16:56:43] <Akronymus> mobidrop correlation != causation
[16:56:43] <davros> this is what crypto is trying to *avoid*
[16:56:50] <mrig> colonial origins, and the major colonies.
[16:56:53] <pyzozord> It's fractal too, the 20% of that 20% holds 80% of 80% etc
[16:56:59] <mobidrop> like in the last year 20% of all dollars were created, all the while the richest of the richest massively benefited this last year
[16:57:03] <mrig> mobidrop: murica too, seems to be consuming itself.
[16:57:04] <DPA> I think capitalism / supply & demand was intended to increase the well being of everyone by making the maximisation of gaining more money a proxy for giving everyone more / cheaper or better stuff.
[16:57:04] <DPA> It's falling appart because, especially with technology, there are other ways to make more money then to make better or more stuff than others. Anti-trust laws cover obviouse things, but stuff like DRM, lock-in, glued shut devices, and such, have flown completely under the radar.
[16:57:09] <davros> i think inequality is a result of an increasingly technical world
[16:57:14] <davros> control the right systems = exponential value
[16:57:23] <merijn> sjmulder: Smart people don't touch cryptocurrency, except to gamble with pocket change
[16:57:23] <mobidrop> that's because this newly created money ends up in the stock market mostly, pumping the stocks of the richest
[16:57:24] <davros> like "everyone uses windows" => bill gates gets rich
[16:57:26] <Akronymus> mobidrop yeah, that the money printers just go **BRRRRRRRRRRR** is some BS.
[16:57:55] <davros> ive no idea how crypto will play out
[16:58:01] <mobidrop> mrig, well France is a bit more radical when it comes to mandatory injections for now
[16:58:01] <merijn> mobidrop: That's why you should unionise!
[16:58:06] <Akronymus> davros but also windows helps create a LOT of value.
[16:58:11] <merijn> davros: I do, I just have no clue on the time frame :p
[16:58:17] <Akronymus> The world would be worse off without it.
[16:58:27] <mrig> beaky: hand rolling is nice for learning to think with the concepts though.
[16:58:27] <mobidrop> Akronymus, do you deny the fact that 20% of all dollars in circulation were printed within the last 1.5 years?
[16:58:29] <merijn> davros: Something, something, markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent or it's reverse :p
[16:58:34] <sjmulder> Akronymus, e.g. my job
[16:58:36] <davros> i'm personally against the keynsian idea, so in theory i'm pro crypto. but then i see the bubbles its creating and GPU shortages and that makes me anti-crypto..

[16:58:57] <beaky> yes i handroll all my code
[16:58:59] <Akronymus> mobidrop I meant it to be BS that they keep printing that fast. Basically calling em idiots.
[16:59:00] <mrig> mobidrop: they love tec here, but are not very good with using it :D
[16:59:08] <davros> i agree that inflation = stealth tax, thats why i'm against keynsianism
[16:59:14] <beaky> my artisinally crafted database handrolls even the integers where i use ternary
[16:59:20] <mobidrop> Akronymus, ok at least we agree :D
[16:59:26] <Akronymus> davros inflation due to printing is IMO.
[16:59:27] <mrig> I think the culture of 'le cadre' is the cause of that.
[16:59:30] <merijn> davros: Well, you either see crypto "currency" as currency, but that's dumb because it fails horrible at that. Or you see it as an investment/security, but then it *also* fails horribly at that
[16:59:36] <Akronymus> Well, excessive printing
[16:59:49] <beaky> according to information theory ternary numbers have an advantage over binary numbers because 3 is closer to e than 2 
[16:59:52] <merijn> davros: And worst of all, it attracts all the wrong kinds of shady people, con men, and fraudsters
[17:00:02] <davros> there's an argument that crypto is building a trustworthy means of tracking exchange. "decentralised trust"
[17:00:07] <davros> "automated trust"
[17:00:17] <davros> currently we "entrust" bankers, the state to track transactions for us
[17:00:22] <merijn> davros: Right, I just fundamentally disagree that that is a "feature" :p
[17:00:30] <davros> but .. .i see the bubles and GPU shortages, and i dislike it..
[17:00:35] <merijn> davros: At least, for 90-95% of regular ass people
[17:00:46] <mobidrop> in the end we can talk all day, but what matters is where you store your wealth
[17:00:53] <merijn> davros: You're skipping over the "climate wrecking disaster" part of it
[17:00:54] <beaky> information theory is one of the branches of computer science besides theory of computation and  'programming language theory' that has a model of what computation is so i should adopt ternary 
[17:00:57] <mobidrop> we can see the winner of this debate happen in real life in the future :)
[17:01:02] <sjmulder> now you need to trust people to not fork the blockchain if something happens that they don't like
[17:01:03] <davros> i mean if the "price"  of cheap GPUs is bankers getting rich, then , the bankers are the good guys and crypto peeps are the bad guys.
[17:01:06] <sjmulder> (eg DAO)
[17:01:20] <mrig> That said the golang yacc will be interesting to play about with for simplifying the process of automating change in interesting ways.
[17:01:21] <merijn> sjmulder: The DAO will *forever* be the funniest shit to me
[17:01:40] <beaky> nice i missed out on the dao thing because i never bought a gpu 
[17:01:41] <merijn> It's the 100% admission that all the philosophy and claimed beliefs are 100% shallow bullshit
[17:01:53] <davros> cheap GPUs for all is more important than the means of exchange, because the internet gives us ways to collaborate without actually tracking exchange
[17:02:00] <mobidrop> sjmulder, anyone who wants to can fork at any time, getting the others on board that's the problem ;)
[17:02:44] <beaky> exactly davros we need gpus for all
[17:02:50] <mobidrop> except if you're ethereum and have a centrally controlled development team, then you get to call the shots
[17:02:54] <beaky> there should be something like one laptop per child but for gpus
[17:03:01] <sjmulder> mobidrop, well it happened with the DAO, so how can you ever trust a smart contract again?
[17:03:16] <merijn> mobidrop: What was the founding principle/ethos of Ethereum again? "The code is the contract", "no 3rd party arbitration", "trustless transactions"? Except when you have a bug in your smart contract, then you hard fork the chain because "that was clearly not intended by the DAO contract"
[17:03:18] <beaky> one gpu per child to secure their future in ai and cryptocurrency, the most important applications of gpus 
[17:03:32] <mobidrop> sjmulder, it happened to ethereum as well, it got abused and vitalik rolled back the blockchain lol so much for "code is law"
[17:03:32] <merijn> What? Didn't you just spend all your hype time explaining to me that the code *was* the contract?

[19:20:49] <MrMobius> it's also easier once you figure out that you can indent and de-indent a whole block of text. doing it line by line would be inconvenient
[19:21:03] <bjs> gitesh: open a dictionary and look up the word "data".  That is the definition of data.  There is no "technical" definition. 
[19:21:18] <pyzozord> hahah everyone has to go through email marketing and a 2fa :D
[19:21:25] <bjs> gitesh: most dictionaries will say something like "data is information,  especially information stored on a computer".  SO yes objects are "data" by that definition

[19:48:35] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: uh yeah sorry, if it was False you wouldn't know which was the false one I mean

[19:49:08] <bjs> InPhase: sure but computationally it's the same, complexity wise it's worse

[19:49:37] <MrMobius> deniska, ya old 8 bit basics were usually bytecode. im just doubtful that javascript bytecode would be efficient on an 8 bit chip
[19:49:44] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: well, briefly, java compiler compiles code written in java to JVM bytecode which is a bit like a machine code for an imaginary processor
[19:50:15] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[19:50:25] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: and then another program, called "java virtual machine" will execute this bytecode, either by compiling it further to native machine code, or by interpreting it, or by the combination of both
[19:50:28] <bjs> I just meant your comment only implied one direction but I see you were implying it's the direction of the proof with the universal gate not just generally
[19:50:32] <InPhase> bjs: In a finite universe it is fast to hit the difference.  In a mathematical axiom set with infinite tape lengths and infinite computational time, then yes, they are interchangeable.  This is how quantum computer simulators work out.
[19:50:35] <bjs> InPhase: ^ sorry
[19:50:44] <[itchyjunk]> in general, interpreters would compile my code to the machine it is being run on's byte codes
[19:50:53] <deniska> MrMobius: we're not talking javascript, we're talking java, JS doesn't have any canonical bytecode form
[19:50:55] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, ohhh is that the compile once and run anywhere part of java?
[19:50:57] <[itchyjunk]> interesting
[19:50:58] <MrMobius> when the abstraction of the virtual machine is farther from the machine it runs on you can lose a lot of performance. it wouldnt be a coincidence if the java virtual machine looked a lot like a 32 bit processor
[19:51:07] <[itchyjunk]> just an intermediate step 
[19:51:10] <MrMobius> deniska,  my bad
[19:51:24] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I mean an interpreter/virtual machine is just a program,  there's no reason you can't run a VM on a microcontroller or an arduino.  It's just that intepreters/VM are usually very resource intensive programs that don't "fit" on these devices 
[19:51:33] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: yes, at least in theory, you can create a JVM for a new kind of computer and it will run existing compiled java programs
[19:51:46] <bjs> InPhase: yes I know
[19:51:55] <[itchyjunk]> oh i thought vm was something that ran on top of an OS and allowed for things to see the hardware without the OS it's being run on

[19:56:57] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well the practical limit depends on how efficient each layer is and how much resources you have to spare, there is no concrete answer
[19:56:58] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Each one adds a little bit of slow down, yeah.  Although Java has gotten that impressively low.  You can assume about 15% if the Java code is written performantly.
[19:56:58] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: if a layer comes with an overhead, then until this overhead exceeds resources you have to spare
[19:57:09] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, so compiler turns it into java vm byte codes and jvm further turns it into `real world` byte codes for real machine
[19:57:17] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: Like we cannot go "12 layers" or anything like that,  we can only say "as many layers as you can take before it's too many layers"

[20:05:45] <[itchyjunk]> damn..
[20:05:59] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: The most I do with dabbling at the low end now is inspect assembly code outputs to tweak higher level optimization choices, or occasional dabbling in assembly for bits of embedded stuff (which I haven't had cause to do in over a decade, as even embedded stuff is getting bigger).
