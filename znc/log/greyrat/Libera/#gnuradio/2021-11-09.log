[21:08:08] <kylie[m]> Hi all, I am new to gnuradio and am not very sure if this is the correct channel to be asking questions, do let me know if there are more appropriate channels! I wish to output the frequency of the peak of a QT GUI Frequency Sink somewhere (either map it to a variable or just somewhere I can automatically get when I run the flowgraph, instead of reading the graph by myself). I cant seem to find any answers to this problem. Would appreciate
[21:08:08] <kylie[m]> some help if possible, thank you!
[21:15:17] <funkylab[m]> kylie: right channel!
[21:15:30] <funkylab[m]> trick is to realize the frequency sink is really just for visualization
[21:16:27] <funkylab[m]> the signal analysis you want should be done outside, and it's luckily not very hard implementing something like that (though there might be better methods if you have a signal model which permits a better estimator, but I'm pressing too far ahead...)
[21:17:08] <funkylab[m]> So, what the QT frequency sink does internally is take FFTs of incoming vectors of samples, calculating the magnitude (square) of them, and then plotting them. 
[21:18:08] <funkylab[m]> and: stream to vector is a block in GNU Radio, FFT is a block in GNU Radio, complex to magnitude square is block in GNU Radio!
[21:18:28] <funkylab[m]> what remains is finding the peak, and the Argmax block can do that for you. 
[21:20:23] <kylie[m]> ahh thank you so much for the explanation! 
[21:22:26] <kylie[m]> so sorry could I know the order I should be connecting these blocks? is it in the order you mentioned? I am still really new to gnuradio and signal processing in general, so do bear with me haha
[21:30:58] <funkylab[m]> it's the order I explained stuff in. Also, when you think about what each block does, you'll find it makes sense!
[21:32:46] <funkylab[m]> (that's exactly why I explained it in that order: if you understand that explanation, you'll understand the order. If not: I didn't explain well enough, then do ask!)
[21:34:09] <kylie[m]> ah ok! I tried to build a flowgraph based on the block orders you mentioned meaning signal source (to create a simple sine wave) > Throttle block > Stream to Vector > FFT > Complex to Mag^2 >ArgMax > Short to Float and QT GUI Number Sink

[21:35:15] <kylie[m]> However, I have the following errors
[21:35:29] <kylie[m]> I am using GNU Radio 3.8 for reference!
[21:35:38] <funkylab[m]> I think you can figure these out with a bit of thought! 
[21:35:41] <kylie[m]> and yes I understand your explanation, just wanted to confirm! It was very clear :)
[21:37:24] <funkylab[m]> so, let's look at these errors. What they say is that between stream_to_vector and fft, what the first outputs has a different size than what the other takes as input (same between fft and complex_to_mag_squared)
[21:37:48] <funkylab[m]> so, what does define the size of input an FFT takes?
[21:40:49] <kylie[m]> hm honestly I am not very sure what the FFT block does 
[21:41:03] <kylie[m]> but I believe the input has got to do with teh FFT size?
[21:41:06] <kylie[m]> the*
[21:41:24] <funkylab[m]> exactly!
[21:41:48] <funkylab[m]> kylie[m]: an FFT!
[21:43:04] <kylie[m]> so the FFT size in my FFT block is 1024. But for the stream to vector, I cant seem to find what is the 'size' to match the FFT block though
[21:51:13] <kylie[m]> ah i figured it out!! thank you!!

[22:07:49] <kylie[m]> hi so sorry to disturb again, I built this flowgraph but the output from the probe signal does not correspond to the frequency of the signal source
[22:08:28] * kylie[m] uploaded an image: (115KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/gnuradio.org/bb4a0e5d1c22942d77c73e95f4b2b8defc0c9e83/image.png >
[22:08:50] <kylie[m]> this is the output I got
[22:09:56] <kylie[m]> the qt gui label shows 96 for some reason, when it should be 3000? also, does the argmax find the frequency peak of the WHOLE spectrum? 
[22:16:30] <Hoernchen> hint: what is 32/1024*96 ?
[22:22:28] <kylie[m]> omg ah!! I see! thank you!
[22:23:18] <kylie[m]> do you know if there are 2 peaks, is there a way to get the 2 frequencies?
[22:28:06] <funkylab[m]> this is a real signal, real signals always have middle-symmetric spectra ;)
[22:28:50] <kylie[m]> oh yes I know that haha, I was referring to signals that have two frequencies, eg adding 2 signal blocks together
[22:28:57] <kylie[m]> currently I only get the first peak
[22:29:46] <funkylab[m]> by the way, "Probe signal" does fulfill the criterion of "I can occasionally look at a value", but I've seen **very** few actual problems where it's the actual solution; we might want to talk about what you want to do with your frequency estimate afterwards
[22:30:59] <funkylab[m]> kylie[m]: well, that's how argmax works. But you could very quickly develop an *embedded python block* that selects as many maxima as you want. But you won't like it! Most of the time, a single "peak" isn't as sharp as yours, so that you need to figure out whether something is a further peak, or the point next to an already-found peak's local maximum.
[22:31:18] <funkylab[m]> this is the point where I come back to what I said in the beginning:
[22:31:44] <funkylab[m]> If you have a signal model that permits it, there's better methods than using the abs-maxima of an FFT
[22:31:51] <funkylab[m]> but it depends on your signal model
[22:32:03] <kylie[m]> funkylab[m]: ah, actually I just want to get the value of the peak freq and store it as some variable, and probe signal was the only way I thought of haha
[22:32:37] <funkylab[m]> let me contradict you there: you don't want to just store it in a variable, you want to do something with that value. What is that? How often do you want to do that?
[22:33:13] <tnt> So ... if you needed to synchronize two USRPs (B210 each with its own GPSDO) within like < 10 ns ... how would you do it ?  The timestamp precision is limited to whatever the master clock rate is and its relation ship to the PPS edge will be unknown AFAIK.
[22:34:45] <funkylab[m]> tnt:  uff, stddev of the GPSDO PPS > 10ns, IIRC, not to mention the clocks within the FPGA aren't disciplined to the PPS
[22:35:35] <funkylab[m]> so, you'll need to have that PPS edge somehow in-band and sync on that(?)
[22:38:26] <kylie[m]> <funkylab[m]> "let me contradict you there: you..." <- ah I want to get that value and then take that value and probably do some calculations with it, in a Python block or something, havent really finalised the idea
[22:40:11] <tnt> funkylab[m]: mmm, right, specs says +- 50 ns :/
[22:40:34] <tnt> I thought it was way better than that when using the compensation data.
[22:43:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> In my experience right synchronization between radios that use independent GpSDOs just doesn’t work very well.
[22:43:28] <Yamakaja[m]> tnt: How close are your devices?
[22:49:07] <tnt> A few kilometers or so.
[22:49:12] <tnt> But they're mobile.
[22:55:55] <bpadalino> tnt: just curious, why do you need to be within 10 ns of each other ?
[23:02:30] <willcode4[m]> The GPSDOs also give you an offset error estimate.
[23:05:15] <tnt> bpadalino: Was just trying to see if doing TDoA from independent stations using GPS as a reference was doable.
[23:07:29] <bpadalino> i imagine you can get pretty close .. 10 ns is just like 3 meters or so, right ?

[23:07:52] <bpadalino> 50 ns is 15 m ..
[23:08:55] <tnt> willcode4[m]: yeah, I know, but ATM in the USRP the gps edge isn't "locked" to the radio ticks.
[23:09:14] <tnt> bpadalino: yup I think so. But it's also not the only source of error, they add up.
[23:10:13] <bpadalino> sure .. sounds like a fun project at least .. keeping busy it seems ?
[23:11:22] <tnt> yeah, althought it's not really my project, it's someone I know that asked if I thought it would work and how well ... so trying to see if I missed anything.
[23:12:10] <willcode4[m]> I tried this once for fun. It turned out that multipath was the hard part.
[23:13:35] <willcode4[m]> Depends on the radio source, though. I didn't try very hard - used analog voice radios.
[23:16:42] <bpadalino> yeah, multipath is always the red herring .. tnt - is the thing being tracked a well known signal to you, or is it all kinda blind ?

[23:48:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> PPS on USRP is only used to synchronize time stamp clock reset. Except on B205 where it is used to steer a somewhat crappy DPLL for the system clock.
[23:49:05] <Yamakaja[m]> Why not drive the system clock from a 10 MHz input? Does the B205 not have one?
[23:49:09] <Yamakaja[m]> s/drive/derive/
[23:50:08] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh, it has a 1 PPS or 10 MHz reference input ... how does that work? :D
[23:50:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: yes an no. There’s only a single synch input which can either be 1PPs or 10Mhz. If 10Mhz it’s divided down to produce 1PPs.

[23:50:51] <blue94[m]> Hey there
[23:50:54] <blue94[m]> How is it going?
[23:51:04] <patchvonbraun[m]> In other USRPs you provide both 10Mhz and 1PPS.
[23:51:45] <Yamakaja[m]> Yeah, i've worked with the B210 before and expected that to be the common approach
[23:52:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> On B205 there is a vcxo and the DPLL provides a tuning voltage for that.
[23:53:38] <patchvonbraun[m]> But in my own tests with B205 that require “brutal coherence” it was not achievable.
[23:53:45] <blue94[m]> Okay nice
[23:53:51] <blue94[m]> Do you have a gnu radio discord perhaps? :)
[23:54:29] <Yamakaja[m]> blue94: Matrix serves as our discord :)

[23:55:07] <Yamakaja[m]> That it's not Discord :)
[23:55:13] <Yamakaja[m]> But seriously, it's a decentralized open system
