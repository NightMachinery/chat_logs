[00:33:26] <Flexyjerkov> i guess not :)
[00:33:33] <The-Compiler> Flexyjerkov: I've talked to some people about this and nobody saw the same kind of stuff
[00:33:36] <Flexyjerkov> i assume picom...
[00:33:39] <agners> The-Compiler, thursdaylark: actually compiled from source, it seems not to happen with that release.. So Arch Linux patch seem to be the culprit..
[00:33:39] <The-Compiler> Flexyjerkov: AMD graphics by any chance?
[00:33:43] <Flexyjerkov> yep
[00:33:46] <The-Compiler> hah
[00:33:49] <Flexyjerkov> amd RX5500XT
[00:34:02] <Flexyjerkov> i've tried the mesa settings in picom but it makes no difference
[00:34:16] <The-Compiler> Flexyjerkov: Thinkpad T14 with Ryzen 7 Pro 4750U here
[00:34:26] <thursdaylark> agners: interesting. If you can isolate it further, put a bug in for it :)
[00:34:45] <The-Compiler> Flexyjerkov: I think setting the backend to xrender instead of glx fixes it for me, but then I get tearing in mpv
[00:34:47] <Flexyjerkov> it looks like artifacting, happens with both i3 and bspwm so i know it's a picom
[00:35:07] <Flexyjerkov> yea, xrender causes black screens for me and weird shadows
[00:35:26] <The-Compiler> yeah, herbstluftwm here
[00:35:38] <Flexyjerkov> glx-use-copysubbuffermesa = false; glx-no-stencil = true; glx-no-rebind-pixmap = true;
[00:35:40] <The-Compiler> never found a solution unfortunately, but if you find something, I'd be most interested
[00:35:45] <Flexyjerkov> i've tried but non fix it
[00:36:16] <MacGyver> The-Compiler: I haven't noticed this.
[00:36:17] <Flexyjerkov> it appears to be related to screen refreshes. a full re-draw of the screen fixes it
[00:36:32] <Flexyjerkov> like reloading of bspwm or i3 will do it
[00:36:42] <Flexyjerkov> or full screen an application etc
[00:36:48] <MacGyver> The-Compiler: Sounds like it didn't start happening recently?
[00:36:59] <The-Compiler> yeah, I know exactly what you mean, I just open a terminal and fullscreen it on every screen
[00:37:20] <Flexyjerkov> i think i've been having the issue since Mesa 20.0
[00:37:33] <The-Compiler> I've had it since I started using picom I thin

[09:51:32] <Iizuki> I got rid of my dual boot windows so I might as well encrypt my /boot too now. Last time I did this I had to use Luks1 because Grub didn't support 2. The wiki still talks about Luks1 but apparently Grub already supports version 2. Has anyone given it a try?

[11:14:26] <shem> i have a focusrite scarlett that supports 44100,48000,88200,96000 and pipewire now uses the correct sample rate for the source. no more resampling.

[16:59:30] <sheep> that does include mavx2 so I'm not sure why this isn't including -mavx2 if CFLAGS has -march=native. Maybe this package's cmake setup is doing something stupid with CFLAGS
[16:59:57] <sheep> or maybe you need to also add export CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -march=native"

[19:46:35] <emanuele6> i have FONT=ter-v32n in my /etc/vconsole.conf file; now, i rebooted my PC (after ~1 week) and i am noticing that the font setting is only applied in the first virtual console ("tty1"). i use tty2 as a virtual console daily and i haven't edited configuration files recently so i would have noticed if it was not meant to work

[19:47:22] <emanuele6> is this a new bug that was introduced in a recent kernel update?
[19:48:10] <emanuele6> `locate ter-v32n' outputs /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ter-v32n.psf.gz so the file exists; also the font setting is applied correctly in tty1 
[19:48:39] <emanuele6> so i don't think that the font package caused the problem
[19:49:02] <emanuele6> i am using core/linux-lts as my kernel by the way

[23:34:41] <jcbjoe2021> Is it me?
[23:34:44] <Namarrgon> did you configure the locale?
[23:34:52] <jcbjoe2021> I think I did

[23:35:05] <Namarrgon> jcbjoe2021: what does "locale" return?
[23:35:15] <Edu4rd> heythere221, the repo was deleted, it seems
[23:35:22] <Edu4rd> Which package is it?
[23:35:53] <Namarrgon> jcbjoe2021: that's only one part of it. go back to the installation guide and make sure you followed it.
[23:36:01] <heythere221> the package is: msi-keyboard-git
[23:36:21] <Edu4rd> Yeah, https://github.com/bparker06/msi-keyboard doesnt exists
[23:36:41] <heythere221> I'm trying to find a tool to use my rgb msi laptop keyboard
[23:36:48] <heythere221> okay thx for the info
[23:37:04] <MrElendig> you could search and see if it has changed name, or someone forked it

[23:40:54] <Linkandzelda> I think my system is in big trouble. I just a pacman -Syu, but didnt notice /tmp was full. now a bunch of packages failed to upgrade but the whole process carried on like normal. running -Syu gives "nothing to do". mkinitcpi also failed big time with a lot of errors

[23:44:23] <MrElendig> install scripts might play around in there
[23:45:38] <Linkandzelda> i'd mark this as a bug, pacman should have rolled back. core packages like systemd simply failed to install but pacman thinks everything is fine
[23:46:21] <MrElendig> pacman have no idea how much space in /tmp will be needed by random install scripts and things they call though
[23:46:24] <Namarrgon> there is no such thing as a rollback
[23:46:29] <MrElendig> also that ^

[23:49:25] <Linkandzelda> i mean pacman should stop if it throws an error like this

[23:50:00] <Namarrgon> yes, which is too late
[23:50:29] <Namarrgon> pacman has the choice to stop before installing the first package or after installing the last package
[23:50:42] <Namarrgon> if it stops in the middle you might be without pacman
[23:50:48] <Namarrgon> or without glibc, etc
[23:50:48] <MacGyver> No brakes on the install train.
