[01:14:33] <operativeagent> I'm not human
[01:15:11] <b-rex> Apologies for the mixup. Please state your entity type.
[01:15:28] <operativeagent> Genetically modified human based organism
[01:15:30] <bancroft> is there a good way to profile django code?
[01:15:48] <b-rex> bancroft: django-debug-toolbar has some profiling capability.
[01:16:04] <bancroft> b-rex: got that one already, was looking for more
[01:16:32] <bancroft> maybe log postgresql query times?
[01:16:54] <operativeagent> I was wondering can I ask like a lot of basic questions instead of hunting through Google results and doing tutorials? I am experienced in python very much, I have some minimal web dev experience, and I have someone who will make the templates for our site
[01:16:59] <b-rex> DDT does that too. you could always do so at the postgres level too.
[01:17:29] *** Joins: mxp (~mxp@138.199.47.179)
[01:17:32] <operativeagent> I am making a site to replace a Facebook group because we have no rules and people keep reporting people or algorithmic Facebook jail
[01:17:51] <bancroft> will take a closer look at DDT, maybe i'm on an older version and there's some new features I don't konw about
[01:18:10] <b-rex> bancroft: the database tab in DDT is the thing i use the most. it shows every query and how long it took
[01:18:25] <operativeagent> So we need a site custom tailored to our needs, I've looked at some CMS platforms and nothing seems like it would take less time to make suit the needs than to make my own site
[01:21:03] <b-rex> there is django-cms, but i'm not sure if it would exactly fit your needs without tweaks. if you're going to build it on django from the ground up, you'll want to take a look at the following projects: django-allauth, django-guardian, djangorestframework (optional)
[01:21:32] <GinFuyou> CMSes comes at price for saving time on trivial things
[01:22:01] <b-rex> especially django-allauth because it can do all the social auth stuff (i.e. facebook login)
[01:22:35] <GinFuyou> and especially NOT django-guardian, unless you are sure you need it
[01:22:35] <operativeagent> I want a system I know, and can manipulate. these CMS would take longer to learn than writing my own code and I can roll out the site while still working on less important functionality
[01:23:04] <b-rex> if your webdev guy is good at single page apps and you're good at python, djangorestframework is gonna be the ticket
[01:23:06] <operativeagent> I can write very secure code, it's my job, both making and breaking

[01:24:07] <b-rex> GinFuyou: never heard of django-nap this is interesting.
[01:24:21] <GinFuyou> Well, true DRF is most used
[01:24:30] <operativeagent> I kind of also want the experience of making it myself. But I have ADD and dyslexia so asking simple questions on IRC is easier for me than searching, although I will make effort to read the docs before I ask the simple stuff
[01:25:06] <operativeagent> My web dev guy makes the i2p web based router console and is amazing and professional.
[01:25:20] <GinFuyou> Well, you probably should look through official tutorial at least essential parts of it
[01:25:21] <b-rex> guardian is a good solution if you need object level permissions rather than model level permissions. but GinFuyou is right. ONLY if you NEED them.
[01:25:32] <operativeagent> I have done the official tutorials
[01:25:36] <GinFuyou> Yeah, that's what I meant
[01:25:43] <operativeagent> Not recently. About a year ago
[01:26:23] <GinFuyou> Well, then should be no problem asking questions backed by what tutorial covers
[01:26:36] <operativeagent> Cool thank you guys
[01:26:52] <operativeagent> I wrote a website before using Django but it wasn't very complex
[01:27:11] <b-rex> i came from the dungeons of flask
[01:27:19] <GinFuyou> At least pointing to right doc articles also helps when you are not sure what you are searching for, I believe
[01:27:25] <operativeagent> Flask?
[01:27:34] <b-rex> it's a minimal web framework for python
[01:28:27] <operativeagent> Oh, I used cherrypy and mako and youtube-dl to make a i2p darknet YouTube proxy that catalogue and ranked and stored and served stuff people had already watched
[01:29:37] <operativeagent> I used to be a web developer in the 90's, I was 12 and made more money than my parents but that was when it was just HTML 2.0 and basic Photoshop skills
[01:30:39] <operativeagent> Then I got into other types of programming. Now I do everything except web development and UI development basically
[01:30:51] <b-rex> flask vs django from a security standpoint. flask is a microframework, thus likely less attack surface, but the tradeoff is you'll need implement a lot of things in flask that django does out of the box for you.
[01:31:45] <operativeagent> I can definitely make it 99.99999999% secure. I work for CSIS as a hacker and security analyst and I also sometimes work with/for the NSA
[01:31:55] <b-rex> i'm assuming django has more eyes on it from a security standpoint as well, so there's that.
[01:32:02] <operativeagent> Nothing can be 100% secure but I can get it close as possible
[01:32:44] <operativeagent> I already bought the domain name and a server because I was expecting Elgg to be suitable for our purposes and then it wasn't

[01:35:27] <operativeagent> The server is nice, it's the first time I've bought a server to actually serve things instead of be my private use cloud
[01:36:55] <operativeagent> It can handle our 30k userbase and terabytes per day of uploads long term, tons of storage, enough cores and RAM to be seamless in terms of latency and capacity, now I need to make the site
[01:38:01] <b-rex> never had a facebook acct so i personally don't know much about how the groups work - but it sounds like something you could create an API for in a weekend.
[01:38:04] <operativeagent> I am starting once I finish this conversation by installing Ubuntu on my Surface Go 2 and then setting it up to host a Django site and the tools I need... Probably will start coding tomorrow
[01:38:47] <b-rex> django-channels will be your websockets business if you need that
[01:39:46] <operativeagent> b-rex I can make the basic site in a few days honestly, but the final product with everything possible for every use case and efficient and secure and up and hosted and debugged probably 6 months to a year. Keep in mind I work for intelligence and military and don't always have free time... But I can type really fast and think even faster
[01:40:24] <b-rex> you would have never caught me back in my prime :P
[01:41:06] <operativeagent> b-rex you might want to apply for this type of career then, I got caught and instead of being charged every time I was caught they offered me more and more money
[01:41:37] <b-rex> i have no interest in cybersecurity as a career. i enjoy building things (securely, ofc)
[01:41:53] <b-rex> my days of breaking stuff are long over
[01:42:04] <operativeagent> I might have caught you honestly man, we have quantum capibility and I have Tor and I2P completely broken, and I do work in person around the world occasionally. Sometimes you can't catch someone with online methods
[01:42:57] <b-rex> hah. i can't dox myself but i'm probably in books you read coming up into this world. jfyi
[01:43:36] <operativeagent> That's cool, I understand. Obviously when you're talking to a fed you wouldn't dox yourself let alone on a public IRC network
[01:44:29] <operativeagent> I respect and appreciate anonymity and privacy. But I do good work, I have a position that allows me to choose my own jobs and missions, kind of like Snowden had with the CIA. "What do I do now?" - "anything you want"
[01:44:33] <b-rex> when i was younger i really wanted to go that path but my mindset changed over time. i have a lot of friends still in the cybersec world. some in very high places like yourself.
[01:45:14] <operativeagent> That's amazing, but goals in life change. Personally I'm leaving this career in 10 years to be an avian veterinary medicine specialist which I'm studying in school now
[01:45:56] <b-rex> that's awesome. i was going to switch careers to become a pipeline welder about 10 years ago but got sucked back into coding
[01:46:46] <operativeagent> I also am an MMA fighter who retired due to heart attack... That was my first career choice after programming
[01:47:10] <b-rex> sheesh. just pushing yourself too hard or what?
[01:47:50] <operativeagent> Yeah, I pulled a Bruce Lee, trained so much and so hard that I almost died. Except Bruce Lee actually died
[01:48:14] <operativeagent> Now I'm just a fat old guy who sold out to the feds haha
[01:48:35] <b-rex> wow. i remember some times doing deadlifts and squats in 100F i passed out and came back with really bad chest pains
[01:48:43] <b-rex> surprised i didn't die
[01:49:28] <b-rex> you know how it goes when the adrenaline starts pumping, the limits disappear
[01:50:16] <operativeagent> I didn't know I had a heart attack for over 3 weeks. I have compromised immune system and get very frequently chest infections and pneumonia so when I was breathless for 3 weeks we (me and my doctor) both thought it was my lungs not my heart. It was a minor heart attack and I recovered fast but I can't push my HR past 170 without risk of cardiac arrest
[01:50:35] <operativeagent> Yeah adrenaline is amazing... I can win a fight with broken bones and not realize for a few houes
[01:50:38] <operativeagent> Hours
[01:50:58] <operativeagent> I don't like fighting outside of sport though. That's not how people should solve problems
[01:51:55] <b-rex> i'm in terrible shape now. a few months ago, the police surrounded my building and were yanking on all my doors and windows. was so scared they were going to come in and shoot me, my heart rate was easily at danger levels. started getting dizzy from it.
[01:52:07] <b-rex> they were looking for some lady that ran from them
[01:52:24] <operativeagent> I'm in pretty good shape. I built a home gym when the pandemic hit
[01:54:00] <operativeagent> I got swarmed by the feds 6 months ago for launching a rocket that almost took down a 747 without telling anyone. I was facing 10 charges of serious crimes and that's why I work for the feds now. Before this I did audits and security work for FOSS projects and got extra money free-lance programming
[01:54:49] <operativeagent> I took down 4 of them before they identified themselves as cops and then I just dropped to the ground when I realized someone wasn't trying to steal my 4 million dollar rocket
[01:55:35] <operativeagent> I dabble in competing with SpaceX... Rich people problems lol
[01:56:06] <b-rex> i think i launched a $40 model rocket when i was a kid, back before you could do those kinds of things without ending up on some government list
[01:57:02] <b-rex> used to build them at school even
[01:57:17] <operativeagent> Yeah I went to space camp as a child and messed with those rockets

[02:01:00] <b-rex> how cool woulda a RC boat with POV cameras on it livestreaming via a django app that random people on the internet can control.
[02:01:07] <hylje> the jungle of red tape and permits you need to touch a computer of course
[02:02:06] <b-rex> a few years ago i was in the planning stages of making a rover that would give random people on the streets a beer.
[02:02:09] <operativeagent> I can make anything with enough time and effort, or my bot can do it for me. The bot is the most advanced AI ever made, I have a copy and I sold Elon Musk 50% IP rights which is how I have the money to do stuff like bulid rockets.... 3.5 billion USD for a computer program
[02:02:26] <operativeagent> That's cool. I have a parrot that brings me things
[02:02:36] <operativeagent> I have a lot of parrots. 11 exactly
[02:02:36] <b-rex> and i wanted to link it up to a website that would let the visitors control and speak through the rover

[02:05:47] <operativeagent> The woman I bought one bird from which is older than me, had 75 and this one got vicious and intolerable to her when his mate died, so she was ready to give him away to anyone who would take him.

[03:28:40] <FunkyBob> put the email address there, let them choose how to use it
[03:28:44] <b-rex> because the majority of society are NPCs that use gmail in their browser and phone, and don't have a handler for mailto: installed
[03:29:04] <FunkyBob> or there's a default handlker, and it's wrong
[03:29:06] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: ok, but what about the problem of passing values?
[03:29:23] <wallbroken> it's clear what the problem is
[03:29:24] <wallbroken> ?
[03:29:45] <FunkyBob> you want to pass more context to the template
[03:29:52] <FunkyBob> for a view you didn't write -- the default login view
[03:30:11] <wallbroken> yes
[03:30:13] <wallbroken> exactly
[03:32:48] <FunkyBob> and this is where the power of class-based views becomes apparent.
[03:32:53] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView
[03:33:06] <operativeagent> Class based views are amazing and shitty at the same time
[03:33:10] <FunkyBob> you can define your own sub-class of that view, and set, for instance, the `extra_context` attribute
[03:33:17] <FunkyBob> wire it into the URLs... and presto, you got it done
[03:33:36] <wallbroken> and what to override the view function?
[03:33:40] <wallbroken> with a custom one
[03:34:22] <FunkyBob> pardon?
[03:35:23] <operativeagent> I don't like class based views because I find it a difficult method to do things I can get done other ways with other frameworks
[03:36:02] <FunkyBob> operativeagent: yeah, I've been trying for weeks to persuade wallbroken to not use them, as they occlude the workflow ... which wallbroken desperately needs to understand
[03:36:11] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: https://dpaste.org/xWJC
[03:37:29] <operativeagent> FunkyBob I have made one simple basic site for Django and glanced over the docs really quickly the way I read legal contracts which is at about 3 seconds per page unless I notice something I need to think about... And I know they feel wrong
[03:37:34] <FunkyBob> why did you change the template name, wallbroken ?
[03:37:58] <FunkyBob> operativeagent: oh, no... CBV are tremendous
[03:38:17] <FunkyBob> operativeagent: however, they can get in the way for newcomers... because of their 'spooky action at a distance' feel
[03:38:38] <wallbroken> i did changed the template name?
[03:38:57] <operativeagent> I am installing Gentoo on my Surface Go 2, got my ergonomic Bluetooth keyboard and trackball set up, my inking pen ready, drivers I am going to release once proven successful and not buggy for the hardware not in mainline... Then onto installing a Django build environment. Is there any good plugin's specific to Django for PyCharm?
[03:39:05] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: if you're not changing it, why specify it?
[03:39:26] <wallbroken> ok
[03:39:30] <FunkyBob> operativeagent: so in this case, wallbroken wants the LoginVie, but a little different... class-based views make it almost trivial to provide customisable views
[03:39:40] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: no, seriously... ANSWER THE QUESTION
[03:40:09] <operativeagent> Sometimes people don't want to answer questions to avoid giving away ideas or concepts or methods that they have come up with
[03:40:18] <nedbat> wallbroken: look at the effect you are having on people.  You need to try a different approach.

[03:43:30] <LuxuryMode> I wrote a custom Django command which takes user input (via the CLI). I'm writing a test for this command. What's the easiest way to provide input during the test when calling this command via `django.core.management.call_command`?
[03:43:59] <FunkyBob> LuxuryMode: doesn't call command let you pass t he arguments?
[03:44:30] <LuxuryMode> Oh, yeah maybe. Let me try that :)

[03:45:12] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i don't know. i was unable to read the code

[03:46:18] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i made it work
[03:46:19] <wallbroken> thanks
[03:46:42] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: do you know what my approach is?
[03:46:46] <wallbroken> try until it works
[03:47:17] <wallbroken> in this approach happens that i do pointless stuff
[03:47:43] <operativeagent> Try until it works is my proven and always useful/needed way of doing things. And then after it works you try until it works better
[03:48:06] <FunkyBob> this is why the web is full of invalid HTML/CSS, too
[03:48:17] <FunkyBob> why we can't have nice, fast, efficient browser rendering
[03:49:32] <wallbroken> now, let's get back to the monster
[03:49:47] <wallbroken> my view that doesn't validate the form
[03:50:04] <wallbroken> you told me to make it as a function view
[03:50:35] <operativeagent> FunkyBob because browsers are essentially very complex many languages merged compilers and you don't have a Surface Pro 7 i7 16gb Iris Plus graphics 4k tablet like I do... My browser is damn smooth on my tablets. On my media center PCs it can barely render search results from youtube
[03:50:50] <wallbroken> well, but i'm very curious on why isn't working now
[03:51:11] <wallbroken> if it's the problem is in the function or is in the form
[03:52:14] <operativeagent> The problem with browsers is they all suck. Hopefully Beaker is good enough that I can optimize the hell out of it without wasting my time. I mostly follow it's progress because I like watching videos of the guy code while he plays with his parrot
[03:52:49] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: well, use elementary tracing debugging with prints to see where it goes and doesn't... and dump state to debug
[03:52:59] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: already done
[03:53:08] <wallbroken> it doesn't enter in the form_valid() method
[03:53:12] <wallbroken> the question is WHY
[03:53:16] <FunkyBob> not done enough
[03:53:25] <wallbroken> if you see my code, is full of prints
[03:53:42] <wallbroken> couild you please explain to me the workflow of that view class?
[03:53:53] <wallbroken> in the way of i can debug and get the problem
[03:54:22] <FunkyBob> the need to have it explained is why (a) I told you to rewrite as a function, and (b) why I keep telling you NEVER USE CODE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
[03:54:27] <FunkyBob> but will you listen?  no
[03:54:42] <nedbat> FunkyBob, wallbroken: you two need to stop talking to each other
[03:54:47] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: but you have seen what i done?
[03:54:50] <wallbroken> i taken your code
[03:54:57] <wallbroken> and i replicated it to a new view class
[03:55:07] <wallbroken> if you see, it's the same code of minicartView

[12:55:22] <ktosiek> Database views and functions, yes. I know I can use RawSQL in migrations, but I was hoping I can get the same "change something, run makemigrations" flow for all database objects, not just tables.
[12:55:26] <wallbroken> have you some other hint to tell me?
[12:55:29] <FunkyBob> ktosiek: I did some experiments trying to support DB views in migrations
[12:55:44] <FunkyBob> ktosiek: however, generally I've done them using runsql migrations
[12:55:52] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: have you done what I said?
[12:56:08] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: "I just woke up"
[12:57:02] <ktosiek> FunkyBob: were you creating the migrations by hand, or did you make makemigrations generate them?
[12:57:09] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: adding form.errors will not produce any output. why?
[12:59:46] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: I closed the thing, why is it still windy?
[13:00:11] <FunkyBob> ktosiek: I was trying to teach makemigrations to spot Meta.queryset and take that as meaning a model was a View
[13:00:27] <FunkyBob> ktosiek: I could make migrations do the work... but I didn't have a way to serialise the query to detect differences
[13:00:52] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: stop being so vague, if you want help
[13:01:08] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: we can't guess at where you printed what... so no idea why it didn't print anything
[13:01:20] <FunkyBob> we know you don't understand what you're doing, so why would we trust you to put the print in the right place?
[13:02:12] <FunkyBob> "adding form.errors iwll not produce any output" is almost as useless as "it doesn't work"
[13:02:17] <FunkyBob> Do Better
[13:03:00] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: first thing i done is to check if the form has been validated
[13:03:04] <wallbroken> i did it this way
[13:03:05] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user/shoes/views.py#L266
[13:03:22] <wallbroken> that print never happens, so no. the form hasn't been validate

[13:04:41] <schinckel> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user/shoes/views.py#L263 that line is almost certainly in the wrong place.

[13:08:58] <schinckel> Oh wait, I never published the code for that.
[13:09:23] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/XM4R
[13:10:25] <schinckel> ktosiek: I can zip it up for you if you think it might be useful though.
[13:10:37] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/1wAw#L33
[13:11:09] <schinckel> wallbroken: That line will print when the file is first imported.
[13:11:46] <schinckel> Which is why you get an error - there is no variable called `formset` until it's during a request-response cycle.
[13:12:05] <wallbroken> so in which line should i add it?
[13:12:15] <schinckel> Inside the method formset_invalid
[13:12:28] <schinckel> Before the return though, because it can't run after return.
[13:15:30] <wallbroken> i already did that
[13:15:40] <wallbroken> the output was: []
[13:16:00] <knbk> FunkyBob: morning
[13:16:38] <schinckel> Okay, but the fact that was printing means that code path is being run. What code determines formset_valid or formset_invalid?
[13:17:08] <wallbroken> schinckel: how to know?
[13:17:52] <schinckel> Can you read the traceback and see what method is calling formset_invalid?
[13:19:05] <wallbroken> schinckel: where to see traceback?
[13:22:05] <schinckel> You've already pasted it, haven't you?
[13:22:26] <schinckel> Oh wait, the traceback was in a different error.
[13:22:41] <schinckel> Okay, look at the code, and find the place where formset_invalid() is called.
[13:23:52] <wallbroken> return self.formset_invalid(self.formset)
[13:23:54] <wallbroken> here
[13:27:14] <FunkyBob> you've put the print outside any methods
[13:27:24] <FunkyBob> no wonder it complains formset isn't defined
[13:27:33] <FunkyBob> or, is None
[13:27:50] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/a0Hh#L15,22,52,58
[13:27:57] <wallbroken> it's not in formset_invalid ?
[13:28:38] <wallbroken> here https://dpaste.org/a0Hh#L52
[13:28:51] <FunkyBob> it is now
[13:30:04] <FunkyBob> and what does it output?
[13:30:24] <wallbroken> []
[13:30:26] <wallbroken> this
[13:30:38] <wallbroken> empty squared brackets
[13:35:47] <FunkyBob> since the number of forms depends on the size of the queryset... how big is the queryset?
[13:36:45] <schinckel> Are you sure you have anything in request.POST?
[13:36:58] <schinckel> Because it looks like maybe the form is unbound.
[13:37:08] <schinckel> What does your template look like?
[13:37:45] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user/shoes/templates/shoes/ordersView_list.html
[13:40:15] <schinckel> Can you try print(request.POST) before you instantiate your formset?
[13:41:23] <wallbroken> <QueryDict: {'csrfmiddlewaretoken': ['eg9Ow27fMdqf12Ts8PRv1NGZaHIU9GAi0V8NfL7hyQL5pBr9MTuvpmK2WpE1X6QY', 'eg9Ow27fMdqf12Ts8PRv1NGZaHIU9GAi0V8NfL7hyQL5pBr9MTuvpmK2WpE1X6QY', 'eg9Ow27fMdqf12Ts8PRv1NGZaHIU9GAi0V8NfL7hyQL5pBr9MTuvpmK2WpE1X6QY'], 'form-0-terminated': ['on'], 'message': ['']}>
[13:42:19] <FunkyBob> yikes, how many times did you put the token in??
[13:42:25] <schinckel> Okay, the fact you have three, sorry, 4 csrf tokens and not much else makes me think your template is not doing the right thing.
[13:42:44] <schinckel> Oh,  only 3. My eyes are blurry.
[13:43:40] <wallbroken> that is because {% csrf_token %} is inside the for statement
[13:44:45] <wallbroken> fixed it
[13:44:49] <wallbroken> now the output is: <QueryDict: {'csrfmiddlewaretoken': ['eu4yaqkVhsLAcJ44TXz2stjJPqYGC9be093xT9kX356qAiCLx1c2Q2nMB8UNqzrU'], 'form-0-terminated': ['on'], 'message': ['']}>
[13:45:00] <schinckel> Is that what you expect?
[13:45:12] <wallbroken> i expect the form is valid
[13:45:22] <schinckel> And why is there no management_form in the request.POST?
[13:45:30] <wallbroken> IDK
[13:45:39] <schinckel> `form-INITIAL_FORMS`, `form-TOTAL_FORMS`
[13:45:56] <wallbroken> what is it?
[13:46:10] <schinckel> So, if you print(formset.management_form.errors), I'm guessing it will output something?
[13:46:28] <schinckel> (I'm surprised, I thought that would be in formset.errors, but maybe not)
[13:47:01] <wallbroken> <ul class="errorlist"><li>TOTAL_FORMS<ul class="errorlist"><li>This field is required.</li></ul></li><li>INITIAL_FORMS<ul class="errorlist"><li>This field is required.</li></ul></li></ul>
[13:47:08] <schinckel> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/formsets/#formset-validation
[13:47:25] <schinckel> You probably aren't rendering the management_form then.
[13:47:46] <schinckel> And then https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/formsets/#understanding-the-managementform
[13:48:23] <wallbroken> 11:17:25 AM - schinckel: You probably aren't rendering the management_form then.
[13:48:26] <wallbroken> why you say taht?
[13:49:02] <schinckel> Because if you rendered it in the form, it would be included in the POST data.
[13:49:36] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/qmYH
[13:49:40] <wallbroken> this is my form
[13:51:22] <schinckel> Well, most of that is not being rendered either.
[13:51:45] <schinckel> Can you try using a template that just has `{{ formset }}` instead of all your other stuff, and see if that renders/submits?
[13:52:13] <schinckel> If you don't include the data in the <form> element in your HTML, it won't be included in the request, and will never validate.
[13:55:02] <wallbroken> schinckel: if i just add {{ formset }} in the template i see nothing

[15:26:28] <wallbroken> well, just going back to the current problem
[15:26:50] <wallbroken> you told me to call get_formset
[15:27:10] <FunkyBob> yes
[15:27:27] <FunkyBob> because  your views handling of GET requests is notably different to its handling of POST requests
[15:27:28] <wallbroken> get_formset is a method of my view class?
[15:27:32] <FunkyBob> time to eliminate the differences
[15:27:36] <FunkyBob> yes... yes it is

[18:58:26] <Chiz> Hey all, I'm working on adding some auditlog items to my code. I have the installed apps part working and I see it logging. However, when I attempt to add the middleware I get "Exception has occurred: ImproperlyConfigured" , this is from just adding     'auditlog.middleware.AuditlogMiddleware' to middleware. I'm not sure how to delve deeper into the cause.
[19:13:19] <hemebond> Chiz: You'll need to share your config, or at least the properties you've changed.
[19:14:27] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/h1By
[19:14:34] <wallbroken> why this is returning an invalid form?
[19:23:26] <Chiz> https://dpaste.org/D0JT   What I changed is adding the auditlog to INSTALLED_APPS and the 'auditlog.middleware.AuditlogMiddleware" to the MIDDLEWARE section. If i comment out the  'auditlog.middleware.AuditlogMiddleware' the app runs.  The middleware is there to add the user who made the change. Without it, I do not get who made the change.
[19:23:42] <Chiz> I was on Django 3.0.7 and receiving this error so upgraded to latest and was still getting it. so I assume i'm missing something obvious
