[00:03:40] <d33tah> hi! i'm looking for a tool - or framework - that would let me debug front-end code using command line. the way i envision it is some kind of JS VM that you plug into your website and it runs all of the JS in it, but also connects over websocket and gives you reverse shell for debugging purposes. is there anything like this already?
[00:04:47] <d33tah> (or a similar thing that would help me write something like this on my own?)
[00:05:54] <Decker> d33tah the debug console is detachable from the frontend... and later hookable  you can use the same gui
[00:07:23] <d33tah> Decker: the thing is that i want to script it, automate debugging, experiment with new tools.

[00:16:03] <bobdobbs> d33tah: I'm not 100% sure what you are looking for. But yesterday I discovered a tool called cypress. Cypress does something that can be described as "time travel debugging". As a project it aims to outcompete puppeteer
[00:16:20] <bobdobbs> https://www.cypress.io/features/
[00:16:34] <daoumilseitek> d33tah: only alt console i know is https://eruda.liriliri.io, but i don't think it will fit your purpose
[00:16:44] <jaawerth> I haven't needed to bother with time travel debugging with JS. I don't actually use debuggers all that often unless something's gone wrong. I'm ore of a REPL + tests kinda guy
[00:16:48] <d33tah> bobdobbs: by time travel debugging i mean recording complete execution - each variable change, each function call, everything - in a way that lets me rewind to a given moment
[00:17:04] <jaawerth> (well you can argue that the debugger is also  REPL but my point is I love m some REPL)
[00:17:10] <jaawerth> it's the lisp dev in me
[00:17:19] <d33tah> i guess that part of my interest is that i'm curious how large-scale organizations do team-work reverse engineering

[00:18:11] <d33tah> i'm looking for something that would try to do to javascript what IDA is doing to machine code
[00:18:17] <d33tah> bobdobbs: thanks, will do
[00:18:56] <bobdobbs> I mean, I'm not 100% if it will be the tool that you want. But it might be a stab in teh right direction
[00:19:15] <stagas> d33tah: it's not possible with js to do that with 100% accuracy because there are magic objects
[00:19:39] <stagas> like Proxy
[00:19:39] <bobdobbs> jaawerth: speaking of lisp/repl/js, I finally got Indium working recently. It's pretty cool.

[00:23:24] <stagas> d33tah: the problem is the hypothetical VM that would support such execution would have to mirror exactly the behavior of V8 or other engines, so u end up with the same situation of not being 100% accurate in the reproduction. so essentially all tests in js are acceptance tests because of that, there will be spots in the execution it can't rewind as you'd like

[02:18:34] <joepie91> in other words: the discussion about "should justice systems be punitive, or restorative/rehabilitating" is *purely* an ideological discussion, that shows how you feel other people should be treated, it has nothing to do with what works on a societal level because that debate was settled a long long time ago
[02:18:42] <ljharb> systemfault: nope, that doesn't exist, if you actually look at the psych and neurology studies on this sort of thing

[03:44:48] <KevinX> dang, Github confirmed my security vulnerability in npm 6.14.16 (just released, but in maintenance) but denied the bounty. I don't care about the bounty but worried about just opening a PR to expose it
[03:45:32] <KevinX> Thanks for the submission! We have reviewed your report and validated your findings. After internally assessing the findings, we have determined that they do not present a significant security risk and are therefore not eligible for a reward under the Bug Bounty program.
[03:45:32] <KevinX> Neither Node v14.18.3 nor npm 6.14.15 are current releases.
[03:45:51] <systemfault> I'm surprised that NPM 6.x is still supported, hmm... probably because it's shipped with NodeJS versions that aren't EOLed?
[03:46:10] <KevinX> Yeah its in maintenance until april 2023
[03:46:13] <KevinX> with node 14
[03:47:07] <ljharb> it's not really supported
[03:47:10] <ljharb> npm doesn't have an LTS policy
[03:47:31] <KevinX> it ships with node 14 though and i think you're locked in
[03:47:32] <ljharb> they're just doing tiny bugfixes, dep updates, and security patches to npm 6, specifically as a courtesy because it's still in node 12 and 14
[03:47:37] <ljharb> KevinX: you are never locked in
[03:47:43] <KevinX> or you have to opt out explicitly ?
[03:47:45] <ljharb> KevinX: you can `npm install -g npm` and get npm 8 on node 12+
[03:48:04] <ljharb> you can't easily avoid having npm installed, ofc, but that's fine
[03:48:05] <KevinX> i wonder how common that is
[03:48:08] <ljharb> very
[03:48:16] <KevinX> what about people using fnm or nvm?
[03:48:17] <ljharb> KevinX: is the security thing in npm, or via a dep? is it related to a CVE?

[03:48:54] <KevinX> but they are commonly used when youre on a project that requires node 14
[03:48:56] <ox1eef> they could block your account if you did that, i guess

[03:49:53] <ox1eef> in some circles i think its bad etiquette
[03:49:59] <ox1eef> controlversial topic though
[03:50:15] <KevinX> its sending the registry token to anywhere listed in the package location if your config has always-auth true, so "prettier": "badurl.com/binary.tgz" would send the token to badurl.com
[03:50:51] <ljharb> ox1eef: of course it is. but if it was already sent in responsibly, via the security policy, then by definition it's safe to post publicly
[03:51:06] <KevinX> a package i contributed to has react native binaries hosted outside npm and my tokenw as sent there
[03:51:17] <ljharb> KevinX: but that's only if you have a dep downloading from a remote url, which is absurdly rare and a bad practice
[03:51:28] <ljharb> KevinX: also always-auth=true is very rarely used
[03:51:45] <ljharb> KevinX: but that does seem subpar. you could certainly try filing it, but if it's fixed in npm 8, it's unlikely they'll fix it in npm 6
[03:52:16] <ljharb> KevinX: meaning, usually when binaries are hosted outside npm, postinstall scripts download them. things in "dependencies" should only be an npm registry, or a git url.
[03:52:28] <KevinX> Well, there's one popular repo where all the stars align
[03:52:48] <ljharb> always-auth isn't a dep setting tho, it'd be in your project
[03:52:55] <ljharb> so it's your npm config, combined with that popular repo's dep?

[06:21:24] <KevinX> Yeah you can use Promise.all() and make multiple requests, then update your state when they all resolve
[06:21:59] <KevinX> I would abstract only the fetch requests though and not set state within that fetchData() method
[06:22:07] <KevinX> Return the data and set the state within the useEffect

[06:37:31] <Rockwood> 2 second showing
[06:37:34] <Rockwood> yes
[06:38:15] <KevinX> Then you can chain a .then
[06:38:40] <Rockwood> https://dpaste.com/5UAWDZU5H
[06:38:50] <Rockwood> this is my Fetch.js
[06:39:56] <KevinX> It often comes down to what makes the code more readable to you
[06:40:21] <KevinX> You can add `method: params?.method ?? 'GET'` to that Fetch method and then not pass it in when using get requests

[06:55:50] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:57:27] <KevinX> Seems fine. You could just do `return await ky(baseURL, options).json()` instead of having an intermeediate variable
[06:57:51] <KevinX> Personally I wouldn't name Fetch there with a capital F
[06:58:22] <KevinX> I would probably call it `const api = ...`
[06:58:56] <KevinX> or maybe `listApi` if you want to be specific
[07:00:35] <KevinX> I have a hot take too. Personally I never use default exports. so I would do `export const api = (url, params) => {}`

[07:20:47] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:21:25] <jaawerth> regarding Proise.all like that, it depends on whether you want to make ll the rqeuests at once with no limit on concurrency or if you want them in order, or batched, etc
[07:21:44] <Rockwood> jaawerth, new code is like https://dpaste.com/G665744J5
[07:21:57] <Rockwood> right now i am working on custom one
[07:22:33] <Rockwood> is looks correct --> https://dpaste.com/G665744J5 KevinX
[07:22:54] *** Joins: c4017w__ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[07:23:41] <jaawerth> almost
[07:24:28] <jaawerth> the `return await` is not going to do anything because async functions always return a Promise, and `await` just "unwraps" it inside the context of the async function. the setResponseData(fetchData) is still going to set responseData to a promise
[07:25:17] <jaawerth> you *probably* want fetchData().then(results => setResponseData(results))
[07:25:34] <jaawerth> inside that useEffect
[07:26:07] <Rockwood> Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')
[07:26:23] <Rockwood> i think data also need to something else
[07:26:49] *** Quits: c4017w_ (~c4017@209.52.68.8) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:27:16] <jaawerth> it doesn't even look like you're indexing it anywhere though
[07:28:15] <Rockwood> jaawerth, https://dpaste.com/8LS7F33XC
[07:28:19] <KevinX> why not do const [listItems, setListItems] instead
[07:28:46] <jaawerth> that naming would be clearer, yes
[07:29:01] <Rockwood>         return await Promise.all([ 'listRight', 'listLeft' ].map(url => Fetch(url)));
[07:29:15] <Rockwood> so i have to make it const first?
[07:29:17] <jaawerth> the wait there is doing nothing
[07:29:26] <KevinX> you can remove that await too like jaawerth said
[07:29:49] <jaawerth> otherwise, that code is fine, though
[07:29:53] <jaawerth> that line I mean
[07:29:59] <KevinX> just put that in the useEffect too. its short anyway
[07:30:45] <jaawerth> it's a function definitoin so it can be anywhere though
[07:30:46] *** Quits: funhouse (~funhouse@user/funhouse) (Quit: Client closed)
[07:31:39] <KevinX> yeah
[07:31:44] <jaawerth> but the first useEffect should, I think, be `useEffect(() => { fetchData().then(setResponseData); }, [])` so tht it sets the *array*, not the promise of the array
[07:32:12] <jaawerth> setResponseData(fetchData()) will set responseData to the promise
[07:32:50] <jaawerth> which wouldn't wrk with the .map that coms later

[07:35:17] <KevinX> so much easier to just set up a cpdesandbox :P
[07:35:31] <Rockwood> ok
[07:35:48] <jaawerth> yep. you could als just do fetchData().then(setResponseData) since the then passes one arg and setResponseData needs one arg but that way's fine too if you find it easier to read

[07:42:25] <Rockwood> KevinX, ^^
[07:42:48] <Rockwood> jaawerth, more things its need to pass arg
[07:43:59] <jaawerth> GET requests don't need and aren't expected to have a body anyway. ust give params a default value `async (url, {method = 'GET', ...params} = {}) => {`, and if the method is GET you don't need to include body in the options at all
[07:44:00] <KevinX> your fetch function needs a second argument

[07:45:21] <Rockwood> i am going to with jaawerth statement on this
[07:45:50] <jaawerth> strictly speaking, I think it's an HTTP spec violation for a GET request to even have a body, it just doesn't necessarily break anything
[07:46:00] <Stinger> are there builtin filter functions that work on iterables/iterators?
[07:46:07] <Stinger> filter/map
[07:46:17] <jaawerth> Stinger: not yet, there's an IteratorHelpers proposal in the works though
[07:46:19] <KevinX> good idea. often its about doing what's clear to you
[07:46:34] <KevinX> yeah maybe remove the body prop if theres no body
[07:46:41] <Stinger> dang, does lodash or similar provide these?
[07:47:08] <KevinX> js has filter and map
[07:47:24] <KevinX> oh nevermind i misread
[07:47:27] <Rockwood> KevinX, actually i was doing JSON.stringify( on data on body
[07:48:29] <jaawerth> I know ramda's methods work on iterators. I assume lodash's would by now but I only use lodash when a projeect already includs it so I'm not sure - it'd b in their docs for sure though. there are also a number of other libraries that do it, both small util ones and big ones

[07:55:41] <Stinger> hmm ok thanks I was about to ask for slim recommendations
[07:56:40] <jaawerth> hm yeah, I don't know if that one lets you only require the specific functions you need or if it's all-or-nothing (or if tree-shaking works well on it)
[07:56:42] <Rockwood> jaawerth, but in case of post i will pass data too
[07:57:10] <jaawerth> personally I tend to use transducer libraries, which can be made to work with iterables or just about anything else, but that is a bit more learning curve and not a common thing to do in js

[08:05:27] <jaawerth> yeah other than turnin the `=` to a `:`, why is it suddenly a POST? also you're trying to pass data but you havent' defined it

[08:06:33] <jaawerth> getting closer
[08:06:36] <Rockwood> jaawerth, i am making Fetch.js to call anywhere in my app
[08:07:00] <jaawerth> now you just have to fix that Ftch.js lines 18
[08:07:51] <jaawerth> I'm not sure what you're trying to do there but an error is just an error, it wouldn't have a .response.json() unless you had set something like that on it elsewhere

[08:16:54] <jaawerth> well, I'm not sure wy you're JSON.strinigfying the error, and the await on line 14 and existence of line 15 are both unnecesary
[08:17:32] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:17:44] <jaawerth> you can replace lines 14 and 15 with just `return ky(baseURL, options).json();`
[08:18:12] <jaawerth> async functions' return values are always wrapped in promises. if you're just going to return, there's no reason to await first
[08:19:13] <jaawerth> and I would get rid of the try/catch and remove line 18 entirely. it's the job of the code calling fetch to handle the rejection according to what needs to be done for that particular http call to respond to the error

[15:11:24] <stenno> its poorly worded

[16:09:34] <Maxdamantus> Neither.
[16:10:04] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus so I was kinda right about primitives and such?
[16:10:16] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: no.
[16:11:01] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: at the moment in JS, objects are the only non-primitives, because objects are the only things which can contain other values.

[16:11:38] <jellobot> (okay) Record { bar: 0 }
[16:11:41] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: but with the records/tuples proposal, there would be non-object types that can contain other values, so objects will no longer be the only primitives.
[16:11:55] <Maxdamantus> er, the only non-primitives
[16:12:51] <stenno> Records and Tuples can only contain primitives and other Records and Tuples. You could think of Records and Tuples as "compound primitives". By being thoroughly based on primitives, not objects, Records and Tuples are deeply immutable.
[16:13:01] *** Joins: Phineas (~Phineas@user/Phineas)
[16:13:05] <stenno> the wording really sound slike they are special as opposed to primitives
[16:13:30] <stenno> so a compound primitive is not a primitive, but more like a primitive-like
[16:13:35] <Maxdamantus> Right, because they contain other values, hence not "primitive".
[16:13:47] <Maxdamantus> What do you think "primitive" means?
[16:14:03] <theskillwithin> stenno has it right
[16:14:36] <Maxdamantus> "compound primitive" sounds like nonsense to me.
[16:14:43] <stenno> Maxdamantus: so your argument is that it cannot be a primitive because its composed of primitives?
[16:14:51] <Maxdamantus> The first sentence sounds fine, and I think it was quoted from the proposal.
[16:14:59] <Maxdamantus> stenno: it's composed of other values.
[16:15:02] <stenno> yes, this is a quote from the proposoal
[16:15:22] <stenno> you pasted the first sentence here before
[16:15:31] <stenno> and i just said that its bad semantics, but it really isn't
[16:15:31] <Maxdamantus> in general, a "primitive" is something that other things are made of.
[16:15:58] <Maxdamantus> eg, a primitive life form would be something like a single-cell organism.
[16:16:13] <Maxdamantus> all other life forms are made of cells.

[16:17:59] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[16:18:38] <theskillwithin> from your wikipedia In JavaScript, there are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null. These are not objects and have no methods.[18]
[16:19:25] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: yes. That is not inconsistent with anything I've said.
[16:19:51] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: when tuples/records become mainstream. I expect that list will still not contain "tuples/records".
[16:20:22] <Maxdamantus> because tuples/records are composite, not primitive.
[16:21:23] <theskillwithin> thats why they were called composite primatives
[16:21:44] <Maxdamantus> Who calls them that?
[16:21:46] <theskillwithin> they are still deeply comparable, and immutable.  thats all that matters

[16:24:20] <stenno> one could argue that a compound primitive is by definition not a primitive
[16:24:32] <stenno> but a composite data type

[16:30:31] <stenno> it took me a long time but i can finally follow Maxdamantus argumentation
[16:30:46] <Maxdamantus> Yes, I think it is just alluding to the current expectations in JS, where "primitive" basically means "everything except an object"

[16:31:18] <Maxdamantus> Sort of like how people call "?:" the "ternary operator"
[16:31:52] <Maxdamantus> it's only accurate because there are currently arguably no other ternary operators in JS.
[16:32:07] <stenno> _the_ ternary operator
[16:32:14] <stenno> :D
[16:32:22] <theskillwithin> well I only know JS so I can't only tell you the JS
[16:32:57] <Maxdamantus> Right, I will always refer to it as "the conditional operator", though plenty of people will call it "the ternary operator" and it's understood.
[16:33:34] <stenno> are there any other ternary operators that come to your mind?
[16:33:46] <theskillwithin> idk what all those failed examples you were trying to do was trying to prove then but ok
[16:33:53] <stenno> (outside of js)
[16:34:02] <Maxdamantus> I would say that method calls could be considered a ternary operation in JS.
[16:34:25] <Maxdamantus> `a.b(c)` has the target object, the method name and the arguments.
[16:34:41] <Maxdamantus> and importantly, it's not the same as `const f = a.b; f(c);`
[16:34:52] <Maxdamantus> so it is quite ternary.
[16:34:53] <stenno> call `b` of `a` with `c`

[20:17:17] <jaawerth> ljharb: yeah. Not necessarily with the % itself (that's how the C-based stuff and the unix `date` commadn do it so I was using it as a shorthand reference), but point bein the standard "parse using a format string to describe the expected date format"
[20:17:29] <jaawerth> like systemfault's example, or the date-fns method that does similar
[20:18:20] <ljharb> i think Intl.DateTimeFormatter is the way to do that
[20:19:06] <jaawerth> that just serializes, no?
[20:19:50] <ljharb> ohhh right, you want that as input
[20:21:42] <jaawerth> yep! it's already easy to do the formatting than the parsing even without Intl, so something as simple as being able to provide a format string to tell it how you want it parsed goes a lot way, less human error than regex parsing to figure out what to pass to Date.UTC et al
[20:22:23] <theskillwithin> someone should make a iCanHazTemporalYet.com site

In particular, using new URL to resolve the passed-in url/path with your base URL is going to be more reliable than string concatenation, and since fetch won't do it for you, for higher-level wrappers it's good to check response.ok and reject

[20:38:26] <austincheney> in pulse's defense it would be nice if there were something like TypeScript that mandated types and compiled directly into an executable.  In that case I can see a massive benefit to pointers.

[23:19:31] <matsaman> you would want them vaccinated at least
[23:19:42] <silly> and not outside
[23:19:54] <stenno> fakuve: is there no documentation about that dialect?
[23:20:05] <matsaman> I'm pretty sure that properly vaccinated the odds of a dangerous illness contracted from another cat are very low
[23:20:15] <matsaman> but they will live longer locked up in your house probably, yeah
[23:20:33] <matsaman> some people get upset about non-native cats eating birds
[23:20:33] <silly> is that like actionscript6? or so...
[23:20:54] <ljharb> qswz: so you're stealing fertilizer and future seeds from that location then instead
[23:20:57] <systemfault> What is a non-native cat?
[23:20:58] <stenno> sounds like AS, yeah
[23:21:11] <ljharb> qswz: the fruit that falls from my trees and rots is important to keep the tree healthy; i'd not let anybody steal those either.
[23:21:17] <matsaman> systemfault: most small "domesticated" house cats people think of
[23:21:22] <systemfault> Ahh okay
[23:21:35] <systemfault> Cats are assholes :P
[23:21:39] <matsaman> yeah =)
[23:21:42] <qswz> ljharb: I make sure to spit the seeds at a good place, that's actually how trees spread the best
[23:21:47] <ljharb> systemfault: nah, they're just psycopaths and murderers
[23:21:57] <ljharb> qswz: the rotting flesh is still good mulch
[23:22:13] <ljharb> qswz: and that's birds and animals spreading seeds, not people :-p
[23:22:13] <qswz> right
[23:22:30] <qswz> we're animals too tho
[23:22:32] <ljharb> it's a critical part of that mechanism that the seed lands embedded in rich fertilizer material
[23:22:35] <ljharb> which spitting doesn't achieve
[23:22:43] <matsaman> qswz: not me, I'm a prime ate
[23:22:51] <ljharb> and if you're taking craps to spread the fruit seeds, then you have way more problems than we can fix here
