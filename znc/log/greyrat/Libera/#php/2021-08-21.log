[00:13:44] <cark> hey gamers, I've written a simple php script that just runs man via exec('/uar/bin/man'.$command) and then prints the output onto the page. it works fine using the php test server but when i move it onto my server running nginx+php-fpm, it fails for /some reason/ with exit code 3, anyone know why this might be? the logs don't appear to be giving me
[00:13:44] <cark> any clues.
[00:14:59] <__adrian> well, the command seems really malformed. but that might be a typo here. did you look up what  3  means?
[00:15:40] *** Joins: harpia (~harpia@58.148.205.168.dynamic.vibefibra.com.br)
[00:17:14] <da_wunder> or your server is not allowing to run exec command - because that is quite dangerous with wrong input
[00:17:32] <da_wunder> could be eg. selinux default setting and so on
[00:17:41] <__adrian> certainly appears dangerous given the example  ;)
[00:17:58] <cark> the manpages say "A child process returned a non-zero exit status.", and yeah that wasn't the actual command, i didn't think it would fit in the message. the actual command it's running is exec('/usr/bin/man --html=cat'.' '.escapeshellarg($command) , $output, $retval);
[00:17:59] <da_wunder> yep
[00:18:07] <__adrian> but i don't think you'd get an exit code if that were the cause. the command IS running, if it's returning an exit code.
[00:18:35] <__adrian> so the error isn't happening in php
[00:19:13] <__adrian> you'll need to try to reproduce. remember to use the same user php's running under, and that there won't be much of an env (e.g., no bashrc, etc.)
[00:19:18] <Ellenor> hm
[00:19:27] <da_wunder> so what I would do is to get that raw command and try to run that directly on that server where that fails to get more information
[00:20:10] <cark> i tried with su and it worked fine
[00:20:18] <cark> and sudo -u
[00:20:37] <cark> (as the user php-fpm's running as)
[00:20:50] <da_wunder> note that php-fpm is not most likely using root user...
[00:20:50] <__adrian> https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html  has a --debug option, might help
[00:21:16] <__adrian> don't sudo
[00:21:24] <__adrian> seriously hope you php user is not a sudoer
[00:21:30] <da_wunder> ^
[00:21:46] <__adrian> (go fix that, if so)
[00:21:47] <cark> it's not
[00:21:52] <da_wunder> if that is yes - then you have potentially really big problems
[00:22:04] <da_wunder> so run it with the _same_ user then and not with sudo
[00:22:07] <__adrian> k. so that wouldn't be relevant to troubleshooting
[00:22:12] <cark> that what i was doing
[00:22:18] <cark> sudo -u apache <command>
[00:22:33] <da_wunder> and also note that your cli php might have different configuration than webserver one
[00:22:47] <__adrian> or, more likely, NO configuration
[00:22:53] <__adrian> err
[00:22:59] <__adrian> nevermind, i though you said something else
[00:23:07] <__adrian> but  --debug --warnings
[00:24:40] <cark> still just returns an empty array and code 3
[00:24:42] <cark> :(
[00:26:28] <__adrian> try to reproduce outside php
[00:26:40] <__adrian> php can't know anything the command doesn't output
[00:31:06] <cark> just had a look at the journal, everytime i run the script this gets logged https://bhh.sh/65j

[00:33:26] <cark> huh, weird. i'll see if i can replicate it on a fresh install. might just be a bug with fedora.
[00:33:35] <cark> da_wunder: will do :)

[01:03:47] <celphi> what is correct way to use config file settings? im assuming using it in global scope is bad
[01:04:09] <__adrian> read the config settings into an object or array
[01:04:41] <celphi> ok but then how do i use it ? i pass it to app class and make it static?
[01:04:43] <__adrian> and from then on, it's a completely normal object/array to be used by your application
[01:04:51] <__adrian> !+static class
[01:04:51] <php-bot> anything useful that you can do with a static class, you can also do with a non-static class that you make only one instance of. AND you get to stop worrying about side-effects.

[03:10:16] <Sammitch> my rule of thumb, is "never declare anything as static unless it's the last resort" because pretty much any time I have ever started by declaring static methods/properties/etc I wind up having to go back and re-do it all as non-static anyway.
[03:10:52] <Sammitch> "static" is really just "global, but with extra steps" and is subject to pretty much all of the reasons why globals are bad
[03:11:01] <Blondie101010> as a rule of thumb, sure...  but when you know what you're doing, there could be applicable use cases

[18:04:27] <Forza> Hi. Is it possible to compile PHP with LTO? I've tried on Gentoo but it fails.
[18:07:00] <Byteflux> Forza: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77445
[18:08:01] <Byteflux> I hope this is a "for fun" thing because compiling PHP for your specific CPU regardless of optimizations isn't likely to yield any meaningful benefits against precompiled binaries.
[18:09:07] <Forza> Seems disable-gcc-global-regs is slower than lto
[18:10:03] <Forza> Byteflux: why do you say that -march native is yealding measurable benefits. Also did python with LTO which sped up munin runs by 5%, so not too bad
[18:10:49] <Byteflux> I question anyone who claims "measurable benefits" and challenge them to present their benchmarks for scrutiny.
[18:11:52] <Byteflux> I'm rather skeptical of any claim to meaningful benefits as most people are terrible at benchmarking.
[18:12:12] <AllenJB> march=native is what Gentoo uses by default. It's a from-source, rolling release distro

[18:13:06] <Byteflux> Yes, we all know what Gentoo is.
[18:14:33] <Byteflux> It was one of my first distros back in 2003 or 2004
[18:18:06] <Forza> I just looked a munin run time go down.. :>
[18:18:50] <Forza> But still your claim is saying that gcc developed something that didn't benefit ;)
[18:21:04] <Byteflux> I'm saying there's no meaningful benefit. You'll spend more time compiling new updates for stable releases than you will in time saved lol. Also by your own admission you have no actual benchmark.
[18:21:44] <Forza> That's the anti gentoo argument. But the fact is most compiles are done on non important time
[18:22:39] <Byteflux> Definitely not anti-Gentoo. It's a cool distro, but you're really just lying to yourself if you think it has practical benefits for say, something like PHP.
[18:22:44] <Forza> And it's a hobby, for fun as you mentioned
[18:22:50] <Byteflux> That's fine.
