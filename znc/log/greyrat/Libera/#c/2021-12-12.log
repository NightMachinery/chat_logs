[02:34:09] <demiurge> C may not hold your hand but it's not *that* unfair
[02:34:22] <fizzie> There's a special dispensation for using a string literal to initialize an array that's just the right size to contain the contents of the string literal but no more.
[02:34:33] <phryk> I don't understand. I have a situation like this and at least the compiler doesn't seem to explode…
[02:34:40] <demiurge> char a[3] = "foo"; is allowed as a special case and will just initialize a to 'f', 'o', 'o'
[02:35:02] <fizzie> Notably it will not contain a '\0', so it's not a string.
[02:35:34] <phryk> Weird distinction, but happens to be more fitting for my use-case…
[02:36:51] <fizzie> C11 6.7.9p14: "An array of character type may be initialized by a character string literal -- Successive bytes of the string literal (including the terminating null character *if there is room* or if the array is of unknown size) initialize the elements of the array." (Emphasis added.)

[21:51:20] <tk> like really long lines
[21:51:33] <hohohoroutines> that's when you want it enabled
[21:51:41] <tk> if soft wrapping is happening here and there, sure, that's great, when your entire fire is made of soft-wrapping, it's not very useful

[21:51:59] <pragma-> because sometimes the author of the code likes to write a shitload of very long one-liner comments. when they're wrapped so you can see the entire line, it takes up like 8, 12 lines of inane rambling comments and you just want to see the code. 
[21:52:35] <hohohoroutines> pragma-: so what i'm hearing is that long comments should not be hard wrapped
[21:52:58] <hohohoroutines> rather than that they should be, as a concession to vscode people
[21:53:23] <pragma-> sometimes the code doesn't have very many long lines, but the few that are there are just noise and not interesting and wrapping them makes the surrounding code harder to read
[21:55:11] <pragma-> sometimes people resize their editors very narrow to fit 2 or 3 editors side-by-side to compare code or layouts or whatever and don't want it to wrap.
