[04:45:31] <__adrian> no
[04:45:38] <znf> why does it work then?
[04:45:48] <__adrian> by coincidence
[04:46:03] <__adrian> it's like math.  2+2  vs. (2+2)
[04:46:12] <__adrian> those happen to be the same result
[04:47:04] <__adrian> think of it like this: what would you expect this to do?   include("foo.php") or include("bar.php")   ?

[04:48:11] <znf> oh
[04:48:23] <znf> I see
[04:48:24] <__adrian> everything after  `include ` is what it tries to include. it's like  include("foo.php" or include "bar.php")
[04:48:41] <__adrian> so that statement would try to include bar.php
[04:49:46] <__adrian> and then the outer include would try to include  "foo.php" or $result_of_include_bar  which is true. convert to int, convert to string, and it does  include "1";
[04:49:51] <__adrian> which will probably fail.

[05:06:50] <znf> how exactly do you do a prepared statement where you need a wildcard/like?
[05:07:08] <__adrian> concat is always good
[05:07:10] <znf> can you just ('...LIKE %?%...') and then bind_param?
[05:07:25] <__adrian> no
[05:07:43] <__adrian> ...where foo like concat(?,"%")

[05:08:14] <znf> or %string% ?
[05:08:26] <__adrian> the arguments are concat'd in order
[05:08:31] <__adrian> so  string%  in that case
[05:09:09] <znf> I see
[05:09:16] <znf> how come I can't %s% ?
[05:09:21] <__adrian> you can
[05:09:29] <__adrian> concat("%", ?, "%")
[05:09:49] <znf> I get that :) I'm just curious as to why you can't just "?" directly in a LIKE
[05:10:30] <__adrian> you can do that too... but it means you're modifying the data
[05:10:45] <__adrian> $foo = "%{$foo}%";
[05:11:20] <znf> I see
[05:11:53] <__adrian> now, you can't do that _in the sql_
[05:12:13] <znf> got it
[05:12:19] <__adrian> the sql would look like  ...like ?   and not like  ...like '%?%'  or anything

[05:59:58] <Gamara> it says 25 and 16
[06:00:06] <Gamara> in the stack trace
[06:01:32] <Gamara> idk doesnt make sense to me either
[06:01:37] <__adrian> please look at your paste. those lines don't line up. i'm guessing they correspond to your paste lines 15 and 26
[06:01:50] <__adrian> in any case, look at line 15
[06:01:56] <Gamara> I am looking ait it
[06:02:04] <__adrian> you access $this->game right there
[06:02:21] <__adrian> >   is_null($this->game)
[06:02:33] <Gamara> yeah but I am checking to see if it is null
[06:02:41] <__adrian> yes, and to do that you access it
[06:02:52] <__adrian> is_null is not the same as  isset
[06:02:59] <Gamara> oh so I should use isset
[06:03:05] <__adrian> and "initialized" is not the same as "null"
[06:03:43] <__adrian> yep
[06:04:02] <Gamara> but I set it to null
[06:04:08] <Gamara> in the constructor with a default argument
[06:04:12] <Gamara> shouldnt it be null
[06:04:32] <Gamara> sorry just trying to understand
[06:04:33] <__adrian> you don't assign $this->game in the constructor
[06:04:50] <__adrian> in fact that assignment will only "work" when $game is null; otherwise you'll error
[06:04:51] <Gamara> line 8 I have $game=null
[06:04:58] <__adrian> you can't use an object as a property name
[06:05:24] <__adrian> yes, and if $game is null, then you have   $this->$null = null
[06:05:32] <__adrian> same as $this->{""} = null;
[06:05:32] <Gamara> oh ok
[06:05:37] <__adrian> you never assign $this->game

[06:07:08] <__adrian> it would be better like   ? GameInterface $game = null
[06:07:17] <__adrian> as for whether it's a good idea, it seems suspect to me
[06:07:36] <__adrian> does a  MessageOut  object make sense without a  Game  object to operate on?
[06:09:23] <Gamara> yes
[06:09:26] <__adrian> beyond that, there's no realy need for  handleWhenGameIsNull()  and defintely no need to call it repeatedly
[06:09:33] <Gamara> because sometimes messages dont have a game associated with them
[06:10:02] <__adrian> seems like you have two different message types then
[06:10:09] <Gamara> yeah you are correct
[06:10:14] <Gamara> I guess I could abstract it further
[06:10:34] <__adrian> this particular type seems to rely on having a game - the data it returns is meaningless otherwise
[06:11:04] <Gamara> that is true
[06:11:30] <Gamara> I could abstract it to make it better
[06:11:38] <__adrian> seems like $status might belong to a base class, and game info to a child class (or to a decorator)
[06:11:41] <Gamara> make a message interface and a message factory?
[06:12:11] <Gamara> I need to get more familure with decorator pattern
[06:12:48] <__adrian> function decorate(array $a) : array { $a["more"] = 42; return $a; }
[06:13:00] <Gamara> decorator is where you wrap one object in another right?
[06:13:32] <__adrian> in this case, i only mean you could take the result from the basic createMessage() and add the game-related info to it

[06:17:03] <__adrian> you could (if you made a subclass)
[06:18:24] <__adrian> or you could use a completely separate function, like  (new GameInfo(Game $game))->addTo($message->createMessage($status));
[06:18:47] <__adrian> here, GameInfo "decorates" the message that MessageOut produced.
[06:19:01] <Gamara> that makes sense
[06:19:20] <__adrian> this can be an advantage because it doesn't force you to decide on an inheritance hierarchy
[06:19:42] <Gamara> I heard inheritance is bad
[06:19:45] <__adrian> no
[06:19:54] <__adrian> inheritance is _done badly_ quite a bit
[06:20:07] <Gamara> that you should only use abstract classes and interfaces
[06:20:18] <Gamara> I guess there are good reasons to use it
[06:20:19] <__adrian> no
[06:20:24] <Gamara> for code reuse
[06:20:32] <__adrian> that's just advice that doesn't consider context  :)
[06:21:15] <__adrian> inheritance makes sense in some cases and not in others
[06:23:06] <Gamara> I guess you are right, its a tool like all others
[06:23:11] <Gamara> it can be good for code reuse
[06:23:19] <Gamara> its easy to abuse though
[06:23:57] <__adrian> shouldn't be thought of as a code reuse tool so much as a way to organize code between truely common types

[16:00:42] <__adrian> my point was that the separator is not reliable/meaningful at all
[16:01:32] <__adrian> its utility relies on the coder typing it correctly to start - i.e., it's useless/misleading
[16:02:01] <Naktibalda> your example would fail the code review, like many other unreliable things

[16:06:57] <biberu> 100000 or 100_000?
[16:08:03] <__adrian> multiplication is easier ime, and also gives an opportunity to clarify logic.  e.g., instead of 2419200 or 2_419_200, use 60*60*24*28

[16:14:52] <The_Blode> So just thinking best practise for mySQL and PHP to process logic on such date/times
[16:15:06] <The_Blode> It sounds like DATETIME might be best for PHP and mySQL parsing
[16:15:12] <__adrian> mysql has native time columns
[16:15:17] <The_Blode> Yes
[16:15:20] <__adrian> no
[16:15:25] <__adrian> TIME
[16:15:27] <The_Blode> DATETIME
[16:15:37] <__adrian> you don't have a data in your example
[16:15:37] <The_Blode> Oh I'll need to seperate the days and times
[16:15:58] <undefined_bob> why you use MySQL when you can use MongoDB?
[16:15:58] <The_Blode> It doesn't
[16:16:01] <__adrian> wait - DO you have days?
[16:16:12] <biberu> that's what I'm asking too
[16:16:17] <The_Blode> Imagine it's 2PM to 4PM on Monday and Wednesday only
[16:16:30] <__adrian> so no dates
[16:16:34] <__adrian> calendar days
[16:16:35] <biberu> why do you even need a db?
[16:16:37] <The_Blode> No dates. I meant days, my bad
[16:16:50] <The_Blode> Days of the week to be precise
[16:16:53] <biberu> why not just a function?
[16:17:05] <__adrian> so yes, store as  day|start|end
[16:17:11] <The_Blode> I want users to configure those dates at will
[16:17:30] <biberu> according to what rules?
[16:17:30] <The_Blode> day|start|end
[16:17:34] <The_Blode> And then explode in code?
[16:17:44] <__adrian> no, those are columns
[16:17:57] <The_Blode> Oh
[16:18:09] <The_Blode> The rules will be flexible as per their requirements
[16:18:13] <__adrian> create table x( enum day, time start, time end )
[16:18:32] <The_Blode> Well, I would need start/end for each day
[16:18:34] <biberu> are you expecting users to enter all Mondays until the end of time, or just [x] Monday [ ] Tuesday [x] Wednesday ... ?
[16:18:46] <The_Blode> Each day could be different
[16:18:58] <__adrian> in php, you use https://php.net/dateperiod
[16:19:03] <biberu> so you're still not talking about dates
[16:19:03] <The_Blode> Monday might be 2PM to 4PM, Tuesday might be 8AM until 11AM
[16:19:14] <The_Blode> Days* not dates
[16:19:14] <__adrian> bbl

[16:39:37] <The_Blode> Thank you Naktibalda
[16:39:38] <AllenJB> Fleck: Are you running phpinfo() via the same method you're executing the library (eg. web request, cli)? In some configurations PHP will use different ini files for different "Server API" (cli, mod_php, php-fpm, etc)
[16:40:02] <Fleck> AllenJB: OK, I will check that, stand by, thank you!
[16:40:08] <biberu> The_Blode: it's not always 720 at noon

[16:40:49] <The_Blode> My PHP server is updating with DST changes
[16:40:53] <AllenJB> Fleck: The top section of phpinfo() will show what ini files PHP read, or use `php --ini` for commandline.

[18:42:00] <no_gravity> When will $o behave differently?
[18:42:33] <__adrian> not in your example, but one can actually have defined methods and properties, and the other cannot
[18:43:37] <__adrian> i recommmend against stdClass in most cases. this doesn't really seem like a case for anon classes either - make a real class that has the properties you need.
[18:43:46] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: My theory is that if you only do what is universally accepted, you will lead an average life.

[20:04:30] <Mathisen> evening, so im new to php. how does the session_start() work.. i mean i created a login system from a tutorial all works great, now im wondering how do i create more pages only the loged on person can see. i just need session_start(); at the start of all pages php code ?
[20:04:58] <Mathisen> or am i missing a step or 2
[20:08:58] <Mathisen> this is the code i have on my current "start.php" page https://bpa.st/BTUA
[20:09:19] <Mathisen> do i only need to use that on every new page a create ?
[20:09:23] <rainmanjam> I'm trying to use phuml (https://github.com/MontealegreLuis/phuml) to build out UML diagrams for a PHP project and I'm getting this error https://pastebin.com/0SA56c20 Any suggestions?
[20:09:54] <relipse> rainmanjam: It's running out of memory
[20:10:42] <da_wunder> Mathisen: first recommendation - use english and not your native language (swedish)
[20:10:42] <rainmanjam> @relipse: Can I expand the memory available to it? I have 64GB on this machine.
[20:11:37] <da_wunder> rainmanjam: sure just do ini_set('memory_limit', '64M');
[20:12:28] <da_wunder> but really I would recommend you to check why it that consuming a lot of memory - because with that ini_set you're just moving that problem forward
[20:12:33] <Mathisen> da_wunder, well besides the comment in swedish, can you say if i understood this correctly
[20:12:49] <da_wunder> potentially you could still hit that memory limit
[20:14:30] <da_wunder> Mathisen: I haven't used sessions for years, I think that it's just easier you to try it out - also we don't know what tutorial you're following so quite hard to follow that too
[20:14:32] <rainmanjam> @da_wunder Looks like the limits are set to "-1" https://github.com/MontealegreLuis/phuml/search?q=memory
[20:15:15] <Rockwood> is google cloud takes automatically cut the amount from card?
[20:15:35] <Rockwood> after end up free trial pack
[20:15:39] <da_wunder> rainmanjam: those memory limits are only affecting github actions and tests - nothing else
[20:16:17] <rainmanjam> @da_wunder Gotcha.. just figuring out where to set the memory_limit at
[20:16:37] <da_wunder> set that _before_ you're using that library
[20:17:10] <Blondie101010> Rockwood:  this is not #googleCloudSupport !
[20:17:23] <da_wunder> and please don't do that globally in your application - you really should set those memory limits only on specified actions IF needed
[20:19:15] <rainmanjam> @da_wunder I'm just running the generator from the command line. https://montealegreluis.com/phuml/docs/class-diagram.html installing it using phive on my mac

[20:20:33] <da_wunder> and what is that exactly command that you're running?
[20:21:18] <da_wunder> s/running/executed
[20:24:16] <da_wunder> and when you're running that command from command line, your php.ini is making that memory limit - so you could change that, or create separated php.ini for cli, or run that command like `php -d memory_limit=-1 _that_php_file_here_`
[20:25:47] <__adrian> Mathisen: i'd question why you session_write_close(), and why you do anything in that else{} block
[20:26:28] <__adrian> but the answer to your question is, session_start() looks for/sets a session cookie and opens a session. yes, you just do session_start() on each page where you need to use the session.

[20:28:11] <Mathisen> define uncertain, index.php is in the same/root web directory
[20:28:22] <__adrian> no
[20:28:43] <__adrian> Location takes a URL. a relative URL will be relative to whatever's in the browser's address bar at the time.
[20:29:12] <__adrian> i assume you're using this session script on many webpages...?
[20:29:35] <__adrian> if some of those are in a different directory, it will redirect to a different index.php
[20:30:03] <Mathisen> ahhh i get your point

[20:32:37] <__adrian> :)
[20:33:27] <Mathisen> __adrian, do i fully understand it.. No :) ... from the "wiki" > "The session_unset() function frees all session variables currently registered." i thought it was needed to end the sessies so to speak
[20:35:34] <Blondie101010> to end it for what purpose?
[20:35:37] <Blondie101010> logout?
[20:36:05] <Mathisen> yes
[20:37:23] <Blondie101010> that's not applicable in the code you showed
[20:37:36] <Blondie101010> especially not the session_write_close() that follows it
[20:37:59] <Mathisen> ok, then i know. i never really done something in php before now.
[20:38:56] <Mathisen> but it wont hurt have it there right ? it is just not needed as no cookie is used right ?
[20:47:46] <Blondie101010> how about I ask you to do a dance every time you leave your house...  will you still do it when it rains or anything else goes wrong?
[20:48:43] <Mathisen> depends if i smoked my borning joint or not
[20:48:47] <Mathisen> morning*
[20:52:29] <__adrian> Mathisen: what you're doing there is _emptying_ the session and then closing it (not destroying/invalidating it).
[20:52:59] <__adrian> explain what your intent is there - just in plain words, not in code. what do you want to happen if there's no "username" in the session?
[20:53:43] <__adrian> if you "don't really know," then don't just do it - learn about it.
[20:53:55] <__adrian> so you can decide if it's what you actually need/want.

[21:31:19] <da_wunder> and that doesn't throw an exception atm
[21:31:57] <biberu> iio7: catch (Error)
[21:32:19] <iio7> da_wunder, I have also tried using "set_error_handler('exceptions_error_handler')", so all errors are thrown as exceptions, but it still does the same.
[21:32:47] <da_wunder> biberu: oh, I didn't know that
[21:33:03] <da_wunder> iio7: use that what biberu said - TIL
[21:34:31] <iio7> da_wunder, but then if there is an exception it wont be caught.
[21:34:39] <da_wunder> then use this - https://3v4l.org/5uCXJ
[21:34:46] <da_wunder> you need to handle both of those cases
[21:35:21] <biberu> alternatively: https://3v4l.org/ONIKN
[21:35:58] <da_wunder> yep, that works too - its just depends the use case what you really want to do with that
[21:36:59] <biberu> usually you don't want to catch everything, catch what you are expecting to handle somehow, and throw typed exceptions (if you must throw at all)
[21:37:00] <da_wunder> how I see that is that Error is greater than Exception - so maybe you want to handle those two cases a bit differently
[21:40:55] <__adrian> iio7: Error (capital E) and Exception are both _Throwable_ - that is, they're exceptions, you can throw and catch them. errors (lowercase e) are "triggered" and are not throwable/catchable.
[21:41:52] <__adrian> as da_wunder says, you probably want to handle these cases differently. to be more clear, you should usually not have any "catch every possible exception" code.
[21:42:09] <da_wunder> unless you're using some custom error handler (for those lowercase e) and convert those to exceptions
[21:42:16] <__adrian> you should ONLY catch exceptions that you are expecting, and know how to fix. if not, then DO NOT catch it at all.
[21:42:32] <Blondie101010> catching coding errors is not productive
[21:42:37] <__adrian> ^
[21:42:42] <__adrian> only hides them
[21:43:15] <iio7> This seems to "catch" all of it: https://3v4l.org/UlZW2
[21:43:45] <Blondie101010> iio7:  why do you want to catch *everything*?
[21:43:50] <__adrian> ...
[21:44:10] <biberu> __adrian: are you feeling ignored too? ^^
[21:44:16] <iio7> I'm doing some testing regarding custom error/exception handling without using output buffering in order to prevent any output other than a custom error message.
[21:44:39] <Blondie101010> wrong use
[21:44:56] <iio7> Blondie101010, in what way?
[21:45:04] <Blondie101010> !+error logging
[21:45:04] <php-bot> In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[21:45:12] <biberu> iio7: if you want to catch everything throwable see my last link above
[21:45:16] <da_wunder> iio7: in your 3v4l example that set_error_handler is not doing anything...
[21:46:16] <iio7> da_wunder, yes, it is handling the trigger_error case.
[21:46:27] <Blondie101010> iio7:  you should normally simply disable display_errors
[21:46:42] <da_wunder> iio7: but that example doesn't show that use case at all...
[21:46:49] <iio7> Blondie101010, that's obvious, but getting a white page with no information is useless.
[21:46:58] <__adrian> iio7: !+error logging
[21:46:58] <php-bot> iio7, In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[21:47:32] <da_wunder> iio7: see there is no set_error_handler and the end result is the same - https://3v4l.org/v9ctN
[21:47:39] <Blondie101010> iio7:  that's a different story which depends on your architecture
[21:48:03] <iio7> da_wunder, https://3v4l.org/bti2T
[21:48:11] <__adrian> highly recommend not displaying errors. they can be hard to notice/read (e.g., on half-rendered pages), they're lost when you leave the page, and they're almost completely useless with xhr/fetch.
[21:48:18] <iio7> da_wunder, in that case the custom error handler is needed.
[21:48:27] <biberu> iio7: normally you don't want to show all the details to the user either, that can leak sensitive data, log it and handle it gracefully
[21:48:48] <Blondie101010> yeah but the "gracefully" is where they get stuck
[21:49:08] <iio7> I know all of that. I am talking about showing users a custom error message. Nothing more.
[21:49:16] <da_wunder> iio7: the point was that your example _didn't_ show that use case at all - so when I looked that, that set_error_handler part is not needed and that is why said that...
[21:49:35] <Blondie101010> iio7:  if your concern is about coding errors, involve QA
[21:49:39] <__adrian> "gracefully" is the white screen. set up your webserver to show a better 500 page
[21:50:11] <da_wunder> iio7: we cannot see what you've on your own screen so sometimes it's quite hard to follow what people are trying to do
[21:50:22] <iio7> da_wunder, yes :)
[21:50:43] <biberu> with gracefully i mean display an error view for the user, or return some error status if it's an api, don't just crash and render nothing
[21:50:54] <biberu> how you go about that depends on your architecture
[21:51:03] <iio7> biberu, agree completely.

[22:18:44] <dag> i think thats overly pedantic :P
[22:19:52] <dag> okay i get it. it's not a closure if there's no scope it closes over
[22:21:25] <__adrian> well, that's why it's not a closure  ;)
[22:22:12] <__adrian> it's not a lambda because it's an invokable object, and not a function at all
[22:23:19] <__adrian> this shouldn't matter in most cases, but since you seemed to think it did, i pointed it out
[22:23:37] <dag> and what is a lambda in your eyes?
[22:23:58] <__adrian> an inline function is the most common, simplest definition
[22:24:11] <__adrian> if you're only thinking of it as a callback then just think of it as a callback, and you're fine
[22:24:53] <dag> ok. still find it odd that you say php doesnt have lamda functions though
[22:25:00] <__adrian> it doesn't
[22:25:18] <dag> isnt function(){} and inline function?
[22:25:21] <__adrian> anon functions are not functions. they're a shorthand syntax to create invokable objects.
[22:26:00] <dag> does js have lambda functions?
[22:26:39] <dag> yes it does and they are objects there too
[22:26:45] <__adrian> js functions are implemented natively as objects
[22:26:45] <dag> it's semantic issue
[22:26:48] <__adrian> php functions are not
[22:27:01] <__adrian> it's a technical distinction, not a semantic one.
[22:27:26] <__adrian> again, if the implementation isn't important in your use case (and it probably isn't), then don't worry about it
[22:27:27] <dag> yeah i see it

[22:32:06] <iio7> __adrian, you mentioned the white screen as a graceful handling, but PHP doesn't do a *complete* white screen on errors. Without output buffering it still shows all output prior to the error leaving the user with a half rendered page on a 500 status code. It's hardly graceful.
[22:32:30] <__adrian> > it still shows all output prior
[22:32:49] <__adrian> yes, this is because you have poorly organized code that begins output before it knows if there's a problem.

[22:33:19] <php-bot> your PHP code can be sorted into two categories: code which _performs work_ (processing input, controller logic, database access, error handling, etc.), and code which  _produces output_ (header(), echo, <?= $var ?>, plain ol' <html>, etc.). work goes FIRST. output goes LAST. https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/9ed2542a695e2ebe30aa

[22:34:13] <__adrian> *example
[22:44:42] <iio7> __adrian, I don't think you have much real life experience. Obviously code needs to be split up, but you have to use some kind of rendering. If you use native PHP as the render engine, if an error happens in the render, then the issue will arise.
[22:45:02] <s17> lol
[22:45:12] <iio7> It doesn't matter how you render. Errors on the render side of the application will cause this issue.

[23:31:07] <The_Blode> I do
[23:31:25] <stenno> i like to look at code and critizise it because of my Opinions
[23:31:54] <relipse> are your code reviews like approval-based or suggestion-based ?
[23:32:00] <The_Blode> I do code reviews in my job. I scrutinize the code to make sure it's in good shape for release into production.
[23:32:20] <relipse> Does the code have to pass at your discretion?
[23:32:24] <The_Blode> Depending on the code, I ask to remediate or I provide advisories.
[23:32:37] <The_Blode> Yes

[23:32:55] <The_Blode> I have a checklist to follow.
[23:33:07] <da_wunder> for me code reviews are normal thing - anything is not going to production if at least one team member has approved those changes
[23:33:13] <The_Blode> Loosely following OWASP standards for PHP.
[23:33:24] <The_Blode> Same here, da_wunder
[23:33:43] <da_wunder> and that is literally company policy
[23:33:48] <relipse> do you get upset when someone criticizes your code?
[23:33:57] <stenno> lol
[23:33:58] <The_Blode> I do not. I welcome feedback.
[23:34:03] <stenno> you really shouldn't
[23:34:13] <stenno> if you get offended at code review, you shouldn't be a programmer
[23:34:22] <da_wunder> ^
[23:34:28] <The_Blode> I work with devs who get upset. Last year I gave some constructive feedback to senior colleague and we ended up in a meeting to discuss the feedback with the manager.
[23:34:34] <The_Blode> Unprofessional in my opinion.
[23:34:43] <relipse> How do you start employing code reviews in a place where code reviews have never been done?
[23:34:45] <da_wunder> those are not personal comments, those are just reviewer findings
[23:34:53] <stenno> the reviewer is not your enemy
[23:34:54] <__adrian> relipse: support from management
[23:35:03] <The_Blode> ^
[23:35:15] <The_Blode> Proposal to management is a start.
[23:35:23] <relipse> All code must get code reviewed, no matter how small of a change.... <-- right?
[23:35:23] <The_Blode> A draft document of Code Review checks.
[23:35:33] <__adrian> yes; every PR
[23:35:51] <The_Blode> Generally speaking yes. If the code is going into production for sure.
[23:36:08] <relipse> But developers don't generally have access to production
[23:36:18] <relipse> so they can't just pass by the code review
[23:36:18] <The_Blode> If you change the background colour of a PHP page, it has to be code reviewed.
[23:36:46] <relipse> The_Blode: do you have that document? Can I see it?
[23:36:48] <The_Blode> Code review has nothing to do with having access to production.
[23:37:05] <relipse> sure it does, if you have access to production you can bypass a code review
[23:37:09] <__adrian> this is why support from management matters
[23:37:12] <The_Blode> Unfortunately, that's propitiatory so I can't share with you.
[23:37:18] <The_Blode> I can give you the structure.
[23:37:23] <__adrian> if someone's ignoring policy, that's a problem for management
[23:37:25] <relipse> Sure, what's the structure

[23:37:36] <The_Blode> OWASP provides an example code review though.
[23:37:57] <The_Blode> Stuff like session management, code efficiency, buffer overflows
[23:38:03] <The_Blode> Those are mandatory for PHP projects

[23:38:27] <__adrian> relipse: use linting, static analysis, and probably cs in some form. this can (should) be automated.
[23:38:58] <__adrian> as for the reviewers, you should require approval from at least one reviewer that knows what they're doing
[23:39:00] <The_Blode> My guys are still using manual processes...but I do wish to automate someday.
[23:39:13] <da_wunder> rainmanjam: no idea, never used that tool, so check out it documentation and/or raise an issue about that

[23:39:56] <da_wunder> rainmanjam: and I'm assuming that you get that working with that `php -d memory_limit-1 ...` thing ?

[23:41:54] <The_Blode> One thing that bugs me in my team is, everybody is writing different styles of PHP...as in formatting
[23:42:10] <The_Blode> It doesn't alter the code but there's little consistency in the crafting
[23:42:22] <da_wunder> The_Blode: and that could be solved eg. with ECS
[23:42:30] <__adrian> you need to decide what/how much cs matters, and then enforce it
[23:43:18] *** Joins: guido (~guido@host-95-239-188-43.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[23:43:19] <The_Blode> For myself, and my company, since we're pushing tags all the time, the code should be standardised.
[23:43:21] <da_wunder> The_Blode: just add ECS check to your ci/cd workflow with rules that you and your team have decided to follow and that is all
[23:43:28] <The_Blode> So the business can have full faith in what they're getting
[23:43:39] <__adrian> we're not the folks to convince
[23:43:43] <__adrian> ;)
[23:43:43] <The_Blode> I'm not familiar with ECS. Do you have a link handy please da_wunder
[23:43:59] <The_Blode> We're supposed to be following PSR2 but the guys don't bother
[23:44:15] <da_wunder> The_Blode: https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard
[23:44:20] <The_Blode> Thank you
[23:44:51] <da_wunder> and that is just _one_ tool that you could use
[23:45:44] <The_Blode> This allows me to configure my cs standard right?
[23:45:51] <da_wunder> personally I recommend to use Psalm and Phpstan
[23:46:23] <The_Blode> I do see PSR12 there
[23:46:41] <da_wunder> it should, if not then just use phpcs tool too with different config
[23:46:48] <The_Blode> I may install this and see how it runs and draft some proposal
[23:47:19] <The_Blode> Thank you :) I'm kinda sick of seeing PHP code that's just thrown together without any consistent style
[23:47:25] <The_Blode> Makes code reviews more difficult
[23:47:30] <__adrian> IF you have a cs standard, then individual devs should be able to automate formatting if they're really set on not doing it themselves
[23:47:46] <da_wunder> ^
[23:48:03] <da_wunder> but your ci/cd pipeline should still check those
[23:48:05] <The_Blode> Personally, we're paid to do this so I'd expect it done by hand
[23:48:14] <__adrian> check *but not fix
[23:48:24] <da_wunder> ^
[23:48:25] <__adrian> that's the dev's problem
[23:48:34] <da_wunder> fixes should be done by dev's
[23:49:20] <The_Blode> My colleague always says "PHP lets you get away with murder"
[23:49:31] <The_Blode> Well, PHP is somewhat lenient but it still has rules and structure
[23:49:43] <da_wunder> and - imho - that kind of attitude is wrong...
[23:49:56] <The_Blode> Well, his attitude towards work is all wrong imo
[23:50:29] <The_Blode> Why program in PHP for a living if you think the language is rubbish. Logic defies me.
[23:50:34] <da_wunder> then maybe you should tell your feelings about that to your hr manager
[23:50:37] <The_Blode> Anyways, PHP is great
[23:51:19] <da_wunder> that kind of attitude could poison the whole work environment - I have personally seen that happen
[23:51:35] <stenno> The_Blode: its not always possible to find a job for programming in an arbitrary language
[23:51:41] <The_Blode> It already has I'm afraid. He's my senior, I'm mid level...yet he hates his job and I love mine.
[23:51:48] <__adrian> the problem is not being able to write bad code - it would be if you weren't able to write good code.
[23:52:05] <__adrian> you can write bad code in any language.
[23:52:11] <da_wunder> ^
[23:52:20] <__adrian> and you _can_ write good code in most languages.
[23:52:53] <__adrian> so, sorry {dev}, it's almost never the language's fault
[23:53:00] <The_Blode> Get this right, he's been working on a project for 1.5 years...and nobody has even peeked at his code. He wants to publish the code into production and almost threatened the code reviewer with "if there are problems, it will set us back months" if there are code problems, it's not going out. Why put out code if it's buggy
[23:53:21] <__adrian> because you need to go fast
[23:53:29] <The_Blode> If it doesn't work, we both lose
[23:53:35] <__adrian> or my favorite retort, "lob security"
[23:53:38] <__adrian> *job
[23:53:56] <The_Blode> Lots of eyes are on this...so it kinda has to go out
[23:53:59] <da_wunder> The_Blode: then raise that issue on your work community
[23:54:04] <The_Blode> Even if it's going to fall down like a house of cards
[23:54:15] <__adrian> sounds like a great place to work
[23:54:18] <The_Blode> I will. My bad guys :) just frustrating the corporate world sometimes
[23:54:31] <da_wunder> just tell your own opinion what is going on
[23:54:52] <The_Blode> I have sorta voiced my concerns to my manager but I don't know if he knows the extent of the issue.
[23:55:37] <The_Blode> But yeah. One thing I have learned on my journey in programming, that, not everyone who does this for a long time is an expert/genius
