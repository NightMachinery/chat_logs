[01:41:00] <rdrg109> [Q] How to show the id in the completion list for each node? I want to do this because I sometimes have two nodes with the same name and selecting any of them in the completion list moves the cursor to the same node, so by showing an ID, I can get rid of that ambiguity.
[02:01:37] <rdrg109> Solved! (setq org-roam-node-display-template "${title} ${id}")

[02:12:40] <rdrg109> You can even make the completion list to look fancier by customizing org-roam-node-display-template. You can show multiline candidates and use faces. This is cool. Here's an example: (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat (propertize "Title: ${title}" 'face 'bold) "\nID: ${id}"))

[08:20:09] <rdrg109> [Q] How to follow the link at point? If I try to use org-open-at-point in the link, Org Mode doesn't query the sqlite database which makes the process slower.
[08:53:27] <rdrg109> [TIL] Links that are located within property drawers are not considered links between nodes
