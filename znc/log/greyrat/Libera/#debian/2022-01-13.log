[05:01:08] <dpkg> A backport is a package from a newer Debian branch, compiled from source for an older branch to avoid dependency and <ABI> complications.  http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch02.en.html (2.7.4 and 2.7.10), http://backports.debian.org/ .  Ask me about <debian-backports> and <backport caveat>.  See also <simple sid backport>.

[17:53:54] <tga> one of the issues with the docs I can find is that they assume you only have one keyboard
[17:53:58] <msiism> This will probably leave your third-party software unusable.

[18:18:53] <tga> you can build hid devices with arduinos and probably rpis, it should be interesting to connect random things and use them as inputs
[18:19:33] <knghtbrd> Then you do udevadm hwdb --update (or systemd-hwdb update … both work if you're on a default systemd-based Debian install), udevadm trigger to refresh, and … then you can see your keys are rebuild on that keyboard only.

[22:30:18] <anon> Anyone having trouble with firejail profiles? Never had a problem until recently. Had bullseye firejail and backports firejail profiles but suddenly a lot of profiles are broken. A lot seems to be related to noinput lines. I purged everything firejail related and reinstalled. Stock profiles break feh, steam, flatpak ungoogled chromium, and plenty more programs. Quite strange.

[22:46:01] <anon> this is all with stock configs plenty of other programs just wont start and complain specifically about broken firejail configs.
