[04:58:19] <saltrocklamp[m]> oh, that's a neovim bug mjlbach ?
[04:58:25] <mjlbach[m]> well
[04:58:28] <mjlbach[m]> more like a disagreement
[04:58:55] <mjlbach[m]> vim/neovim do not represent line breaks with \r (^M), the protocol specifies every ^M must signify a line break
[04:59:14] <mjlbach[m]> if we added proper handling for this, it would dramatically increase the complexity of the codebase
[04:59:34] <saltrocklamp[m]> so the protocol specifies that you can't put CR characters in strings?
[04:59:48] <mjlbach[m]> No, the protocol specifies \r signifies a new line
[05:00:41] <saltrocklamp[m]> as in, a new line with respect to line number in the file?
[05:00:50] <saltrocklamp[m]> expecting that the editor always display a literal CR as a line break?
[05:00:53] <mjlbach[m]> Let me give a more obvious example
[05:01:27] <mjlbach[m]> 1. def main()
[05:01:27] <mjlbach[m]> 2.   print('test'); ^M print('test2')
[05:01:27] <mjlbach[m]> 3.   return None
[05:01:37] <mjlbach[m]>  * ```python... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/ffb802e71985fb863bb22f439e3d49e76bd02114)
[05:02:22] <saltrocklamp[m]> sure, and on an old old macintosh that would be a line break :P
[05:02:23] <mjlbach[m]> vim allows inline ^M, so when you put the cursor on the first print, and request something like hover, we send row 1 (0-indexed) as the location regardless of where it is on line 2
[05:02:25] *** Joins: DonRichie (~DonRichie@ricl.de)
[05:02:40] <mjlbach[m]> according to the protocol you would need to distinguish between the first and second half of the line
[05:03:06] <mjlbach[m]> which means we would need to scan every line for \r (not just the current line) on every request and on ever synchronization operation
[05:03:46] <saltrocklamp[m]> ok, i think that's the same thing i was saying. the protocol expects the editor to display CR as a line break visually, even if it's embedded in a string
[05:03:56] <mjlbach[m]> visually it does not matter
[05:04:21] <mjlbach[m]> what matters is the request parameters, and the synchronization notifications

[07:15:42] <hyperreal> hi all. what is the lua syntax of the 'which' command? Like in my config, I want to set the bash-language-server cmd for LSP,
[07:16:04] <hyperreal> but depending on how I install it and on what distros, it could be at different locations
[07:16:44] <mjlbach[m]> wdym "which" command
[07:16:49] <hyperreal> if it's in PATH, something like `which bash-language-server` will find it
[07:16:54] <mjlbach[m]> well
[07:17:07] <mjlbach[m]> if it's on path you don't need to use which to use it with lspconfig or start_client :) 
[07:17:49] <hyperreal> hmmm, I could have sworn there was a reason I had to specify the location. I'll try it without
[07:21:01] <hyperreal> okay so, yeah, I didn't need to do that lol. thanks
[07:21:16] <mjlbach[m]> no problem :) 
[07:21:25] <mjlbach[m]> cmd is basically directly forwarded to uv_spawn

[14:32:05] <marcelarieMarcel> I used `live_grep` to search those params but I don't find anything 
[14:33:10] <marcelarieMarcel> sometimes with better context I find quickly what haves to be changed but I don't know if there is a more verbose logs
[14:33:17] <marcelarieMarcel> that will be nice
[14:33:31] <dumbdemic[m]> Where did you search?
[14:33:39] <marcelarieMarcel> in my config
[14:34:44] <marcelarieMarcel> I think  its a plugin that uses a fuzzy finder and they changed the config 
[14:34:48] <dumbdemic[m]> Sometimes errors like that come from plugins, you might try searching your plugins for that
[14:35:03] <marcelarieMarcel> yep thanks!
[14:35:22] <marcelarieMarcel> I just wanted to know if there is any way of tracking those messages that come from plugins
[14:35:27] <marcelarieMarcel> warnings in general in neovim
[14:36:26] <marcelarieMarcel> that warning normally comes from a line in the config of a plugin that has changed the naming or something else right? so there must be a way of knowing the line and the path
[14:36:33] <marcelarieMarcel> maybe I'm wrong 
[14:36:56] <dumbdemic[m]> Not that I am aware, I usually recursive search keywords in the message in either my config or plugins to find the issue

[17:44:09] <minutestoseconds> ii14[m]: Im on debian based distro... V0.4.4
[17:44:33] <ii14[m]> this is a very old version, we're on 0.6 now
[17:44:36] <Bowuigi[m]> Uninstall it and compile
[17:44:37] <ii14[m]> 0.4 didn't have lsp
[17:44:55] <ii14[m]> what debian distro exactly, ubuntu by any chance?
[17:44:59] <ii14[m]> if so there is a PPA
[17:45:01] <Bowuigi[m]> Bowuigi[m]: That one is too old, I had to do that myself on Ubuntu
[17:45:22] <ii14[m]> you can install "unstable" version that's more up to date
[17:45:22] <minutestoseconds> ii14[m]: How can be on latest 
[17:45:26] <Bowuigi[m]> ii14[m]: Is the PPA on 0.6?

[17:46:08] <Bowuigi[m]> Ubuntu based so the PPA should work

[18:18:36] <dumbdemic[m]> If you want full neovim experience start with minimal `init.lua` and plugin management like `packer`, and for coding , lspconfig, treesitter, null-ls.  You can also demo popular configs like Nvchad with cheovim for inspiration and pivoting different configs.

[18:45:13] <dumbdemic[m]> Well one has the choice regarding how they wish to learn but I consider a lua first approach to be more rewarding in terms of neovim performance and knowledge transfer with programming concepts.
[18:46:16] <dumbdemic[m]> s/with/of/
[18:46:53] <ii14[m]> last time I checked writing your config in lua didn't impact the performance and startup times in any meaningful way. if it did I'd use it, but it didn't so I just pick whatever is more convenient at the time, and that's often vim script

[18:47:54] <Bowuigi[m]> dumbdemic[m]: There isn't much of a performance advantage on using Lua since you call Neovim functions very often anyway
[18:48:01] <numToStr[m]> (he wanted to learn vim the editor not which is better vimscript or lua)
[18:48:12] <Bowuigi[m]> Lol
[18:48:38] <Bowuigi[m]> So yeah, do the vimtutor and read some of the first user manuals
[18:48:42] <ii14[m]> as for learning programming concepts, I'm already a programmer, so it's not an issue for me personally
[18:48:55] <ii14[m]> but maybe for some it's a valid thing

[18:54:19] <dumbdemic[m]> Great think about knowledge transfer is that it works both ways, I learned lua through Neovim and it was quite fun.
[19:01:39] <ii14[m]> that's okay, I'm just saying that you need to understand some of the vimscript anyway. the commands you're entering on the command line is vim script, and though you could use lua, vim script will be more convenient to type. and lua support isn't complete, so keybindings will still use vimscript (or normal mode I guess), with <expr> it still expects a vimscript expression, many commands like :autocmd :highlight :syntax :command are through vim
[19:01:40] <ii14[m]> script only, syntax for setting options is more convenient etc

[19:35:12] <marcelarie[m]> any recommendation on what to use to parse json calls on lua?
[19:35:54] <marcelarie[m]> i seen `lua-cjson` and `lua-json` but I don't know if that its the way or normally everyone uses pure lua without libs when doing nvim plugins 
[19:36:09] <marcelarie[m]> as you can see it's my first try haha
[19:36:28] <numToStr[m]> `:h vim.json`
[19:36:48] <numToStr[m]> * :h vim.json
[19:36:49] <clason[m]> you mean `vim.mpack`?
[19:37:13] <marcelarie[m]> thanks I take a look on vim.json 
[19:37:29] <marcelarie[m]> I don't know vim.mpack

[19:46:52] <clason[m]> as I said, missing docs
[19:47:04] <clason[m]> but you can use `vim.json.decode(payload)`
