[00:51:17] <Joanna> jan6: I think much of the focus on street crime is to distract from the fact that most
[00:51:43] <jan6> that most?
[00:53:31] <Joanna> The majority of what we consider crime is committed by upstanding rich people and others in charge. The worst crimes are never punished at all yet we worry about someone swiping a cheap backpack:)
[00:55:08] <Joanna> Because it gives us a sense of control.

[01:03:48] <Joanna> jan6:
[01:04:04] <jan6> well, incorrect
[01:04:17] <jan6> it is simply not crime, but how the society works ;P
[01:06:27] <jan6> it's all relative, anyway, for the most part, like if you make a contract that pushes the limits of what is allowed, but is technically legal, then that's not a crime, it's just unethical
[01:06:37] <jan6> crime is, by definition, breaking the law
[01:07:52] <jan6> and courts are based on the principle that the judge should try to make right decisions and be impartial, but is allowed to make pretty much any decision, including punishing clearly innocent people, or letting go of clearly evil ones
[01:08:41] <jan6> (of course there's a lot of limitations to that, but still basically true)
[01:11:42] <jan6> of course, it all depends on your POV also
[01:14:34] <jan6> like, do you consider "I lost thousands of $money worth of stuff because someone stole it" to be less of a crime than "employees of X corp are heavily encouraged to work overtime, and get a lot less than comparable jobs at my company"? one is unlawful, the other is just horrible practice in the name of money
[01:15:33] <jan6> or similarly, would "police killed yet another man" be any worse than "some thug killed yet another woman"?
[01:15:48] <jan6> it's all relative, and a matter of perspective
[01:17:16] <jan6> the richer you are, the more you can afford to dance right at the edge of what is acceptable, or bend the perception of stuff, or in general, figure out ways that are technically allowed, but might not be "morally right", and that other, less powerful people might not be able to do

[02:07:20] <Joanna> Maybe I shouldn’t have used the word crime because the people who rob and murder the most also get to make the laws.
[02:10:52] <Joanna> jan6: the video has advertisements..
[02:13:11] <Joanna> The interesting thing about mass murder or destruction by upstanding rich people is they always blame it on some flunkie who was set up ahead of time.
[02:13:51] <jan6> imagine not using adblock ;P
[02:14:04] <jan6> also the people who make the laws, don't murder
[02:14:15] <jan6> not even by proxy
[02:14:40] <jan6> well, other than the military d00dz, I guess
[02:14:55] <jan6> (incl defence ministers and whatnots)
[02:15:00] <Joanna> If someone wants to show me ads I have no interest in what they are saying. Nobody is paying me to watch YouTube.
[02:15:37] <jan6> you can aways use invidious like a normal person
[02:15:54] <Joanna> The victors of wars write history and laws.
[02:16:22] <jan6> the options are paywall and require a payment, or show some ads, and I would take ads any day
[02:17:00] <Joanna> I don’t know what invidious is but I’m not watching videos from people beholden to advertisers.
[02:17:24] <jan6> victors don't write history, but they do set out the priorities and have their agenda heard the loudest ;P
[02:18:03] <Joanna> I’ll stick to watching videos posted by grannies who want to show people how to knit...
[02:18:09] <jan6> uh, you cannot choose to NOT have ads, Joanna, even if you don't monetize yourself, all it takes is ANYONE claiming you infringe on copyright, whether you do or not, and they can put ads on your video
[02:18:10] <jan6> lol
[02:18:29] <jan6> youtube is a broken system
[02:18:58] <Joanna> You tube doesn’t have ads on all videos
[02:19:58] <jan6> of course
[02:20:10] <jan6> and even if they do you don't always see them
[02:20:31] <jan6> you only see ads SOMETIMES, on SOME of the ad points, of SOME of the videos
[02:21:20] <Joanna> The person making the video is in effect advertising to begin with.

[02:22:10] <jan6> unless you consider ALL opinion and ALL of creation advertising...which you technically can do...
[02:22:53] <Joanna> I watched a granny advertising how to make mittens and then I made mittens.
[02:23:02] <jan6> good for you
[02:23:21] <Joanna> It was still advertising..
[02:24:10] <Joanna> Often they advertise by mentioning the type of yarn they use. I don’t mind that type of advertising
[02:24:19] <jan6> as I said, "unless you consider EVERYTHING advertising"
[02:24:54] <jan6> you're advertising your opinion, you're advertising the specific technique you prefer, you're advertising your skill by showing how good you are, etc
[02:27:05] <Joanna> Most advertisements as we know then want you to spend money but time is money so spending my time is still something. What is an hour of my time worth?
[02:27:42] <Joanna> I don’t mind donating my time to things I consider worthwhile.
[02:28:41] <jan6> actually no, most advertisements want you to get something, but a LOT are free things where you don't pay money, you pay with time (and probably analytics and other data)
[02:28:53] <jan6> or you just WANT to pay LATER
[02:29:27] <jan6> e.g. "join now for free, get 10000 free coins" "join now, first 3 months free, cancel anytime" etc
[02:29:29] <Joanna> I’m not donating my time to people who want to show me things I’m not interested in nor am I donating my time to trying to get around ads that shouldn’t be there to begin with.
[02:29:56] <jan6> as I said before, they're the only real way
[02:30:13] <jan6> the only alternative is a payment requirement
[02:30:19] <Joanna> Real?
[02:30:53] <Joanna> How about not consuming their content ?
[02:31:31] <jan6> well, they are for companies to make profit, you either show ads, or require a payment (probably subscription), or possibly
[02:31:54] <Joanna> Or donations
[02:31:57] <jan6> the only way to have ad-free web, is to go back in time and prevent the commercialization of it in the first place
[02:32:01] <jan6> donations are the latter
[02:32:35] <Joanna> I would prefer a web that isn’t commercialized
[02:32:39] <jan6> of course
[02:32:42] <jan6> a lot of people would
[02:33:31] <jan6> on one hand it would remove a lot of useful and interesting things, but on the other, it would also remove most of the nonsense and misinformation and data collection and whatnot
[02:34:22] <Joanna> There would still be useful interesting things
[02:34:29] <jan6> e.g. a video hosting platform is not feasible without some sort of funding, meaning everyone must afford to have their own servers powerful enough to handle everyone who wants to watch videos
[02:34:47] <jan6> and stackoverflow sort of stuff wouldn't be there either
[02:35:02] <jan6> you'd just have wikis for information, and barely anything else
[02:35:26] <jan6> and wikis and forums would still have trolls, as they always have
[02:36:00] <jan6> (and vandals)
[02:36:33] <jan6> (and just people claiming stuff they think they know, without any sources, which might be actually opposite of true)
[02:37:42] <Joanna> The whole Wikipedia is propaganda. It has some good articles sure but a lot of it is garbage

[02:39:43] <jan6> wikipedia is not the only wiki, nor the first wiki, ya doof
[02:39:52] <jan6> also that's the point I'm getting across
[02:39:55] *** Joanna sets mode: -o Joanna
[02:40:44] <jan6> you'd just have a dozens of wikis, many of which would have inaccurate information
[02:41:00] <jan6> and dozens of forums, with people claiming contradictory info
[02:41:43] <jan6> well, assuming that everything is still "widely acessible", and not limited to "universities only" like it originally was
[02:42:51] <Joanna> I think without monetization there would be a lot less garbage.
[02:43:23] <Joanna> Everyone still has to pay for internet access either way it’s not free.
[02:44:38] <jan6> without monetization there would be a lot less INCENTIVE for garbage, but not really any considerable amount less of it

[02:45:47] <Joanna> Less people will do things if they aren’t being paid to.
[02:45:54] <jan6> exactly
[02:46:06] <jan6> if you prevented internet money transactions from ever becoming a thing, then sure, you'd get rid of a lot of spam, but you wouldn't get rid of any actual garbage
[02:46:24] <Joanna> Look at all the lurkers here who don’t talk because nobody is paying them to.
[02:46:37] <jan6> who's paying YOU to chat, by that logic?
[02:47:13] <Joanna> I’m not being paid. Chatting is a compulsion I’m afraid..
[02:47:30] <Joanna> I probably need to go do something productive...
[02:47:51] <jan6> lurkers are often either 1) people who forgot they're here, 2) people who simply don't want to contribute to chat, but like to see what's being said, often due to them not feeling like they have anything to contribute, or 3) bots that just sit and log the chat (although so do most people)
[04:24:24] <Joanna> I guess. It’s a shame more people don’t talk in irc...
