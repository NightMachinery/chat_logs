[00:35:09] <silverdust> Hi, I have a script to `apt-get install zsh` on a machine where I can't send stdin to. zsh happens to ask if you want to use the existing config or a new one. Because I can't respond, my script freezes at this point. Is there a way to `apt-get` and tell it to just use defaults? or specify a response for any prompts with a flag in the command?
[00:35:12] <xx> f8e4_: keeping in mind that dnssec does not hide anything (provides zero privacy), unlike dnscrypt/doh
[00:35:39] <xx> silverdust: create zshrc before installing zsh

[00:36:39] <silverdust> I think the problem is happening because I already have a zshrc created

[05:17:58] <brachamh> PMT i got it going this evening, by not using gparted but using parted and mkfs to recreate the file system on the clip drive
[05:18:17] <blluis> No, means, that I can't remove it?
[05:18:31] <sussudio> blluis: gnome depends on it

[05:39:21] <blluis> This way of forcing users to use some applications, like gedit in this case, is the reason for the users to leave operating systems or desktops, I leave windows in debian 7 era, now, Im thinking on leaving gnome for good....
[05:39:52] <jkc> blluis: All that's doing is listing the alternatives that YOU have installed.
[05:39:58] <jkc> If it doesn't list any, then install something.
[05:40:27] <blluis> already have kate installed, I just added with some other option in alternatives and I changed to kate
[05:40:46] <blluis> Still many many many files opens with gedit and I have to right click on file to select kate
[05:40:53] <jkc> Then what in the world are you crying about?
[05:41:10] <blluis> some other mime types that I already added to some defaults.list file now open with kate
[05:41:20] <blluis> but its a nightmare to configure a desktop in this way
[05:44:58] <blluis> SOLVED: removed the gedit bin manually...
[05:48:41] <somiaj> blluis: most things use xdg-open these days, you can use xdg-mime to configure default applicationst hat way, but yea now there are like 3-4 different places you need to set the 'default', there is also the $EDITOR variable
[05:49:06] <somiaj> not many tings really use the debian altenratives systems unless they call a binary directly, but open/xdg-open is fairly common, espically in the desktop world
[05:49:26] <blluis> Already try the $EDITOR and didnt work
[05:49:39] <somiaj> yea, most likely xdg-mime and xdg-open is what is triggeing it
[05:51:58] <blluis> I need to focus on my work, not in configuring a desktop because the genious that create the desktop force ppl to use in some or other way.... I've been using debian/gnome since version 7 and upgrading from version to version, some weeks ago I made a fresh install of debian 11 and I been configuring things for almost two weeks, looks like things are in some way a little capricious
[05:52:48] <blluis> updates alternatives didn't list kate editor, I have to manually add to the list, then it appears on editor-config
[05:53:08] <blluis> but still gedit was the default for files that I didnt add manually to defaults.list

[05:53:54] <blluis> so, I remove the gedit binary and problem solved, if gnome complains about NO default editor, will be the time to move to another desktop, as I move from windows to debian and from Firefox to Brave....
[05:54:26] <sussudio> where did you get brave from
[05:54:35] <blluis> from brave.com
[05:54:59] <sussudio> so, you frankendebianned yourself
[05:55:34] <blluis> hehhee, I dont understand that, spanish is my primary language and there are many things that I dont understand
[05:55:44] <kirk781> Installing Brave would require configuring their repos; they don't give downloadable debs I guess
[05:56:25] <blluis> just add a pgp signature and add the repo, just 10 seconds of my time, and not 3 hours to figure out how to REMOVE a text editor
[05:56:48] <kirk781> I liked the fact that they had integrated Tor mode in their browser. They added their own custom Search engine as well
[05:57:10] <kirk781> Brave Search is now default instead of Google, I guess on latest versions
[05:57:28] <blluis> yes, but I didn't try, I use duckduck and disabled all of the other search engines
[05:57:46] <kirk781> blluis, three hours? Watt were you trying to do? compiling gentoo
[05:58:00] <jkc> blluis: It means that you installed packages from multiple incompatible sources.
[05:58:05] <blluis> Ohhh no, I remember my times playing and compiling gentoo.
[05:58:24] <blluis> No no, just three hours searching on the net and editing files to change the default text editor
[05:58:27] <blluis> Nothing installed
[05:58:34] <jkc> That doesn't take three hours.
[05:58:47] <blluis> I have 50, Im a sloooowly person
[05:58:49] <blluis> hehehee
[05:58:52] <kirk781> blluis, I remembered wasting an evening trying to compile a package only to end up in dependency hell
[05:58:54] <blluis> 51 to be exact
[05:59:13] <kirk781> Or that aftertoon when PulseAudio screwed me worse than a screwdriver would
[05:59:58] <blluis> The fastest operating system that I ever had was a gentoo, about 8 years ago
[06:00:16] <jkc> Spend three hours compiling crap to save you two seconds at boot time. "Faster."
[06:00:55] <blluis> you are mixing things...
[06:01:28] <kirk781> jkc, technically, it's two seconds per boot...
[06:01:50] <kirk781> But don't kick me, Debian > Gentoo :p
[06:02:07] <jkc> kirk781: Oh, sure, it only takes 5,400 restarts to break even.
[06:02:34] <kirk781> jkc, I am sure there exists somewhere a Gentoo user who has done that :p
[06:02:53] <jkc> Gentoo has gone from distro to meme to joke. I've tried to tinker with it lately. Even with conservative configuration, it failed to even compile basic stuff during install.
[06:02:56] <jkc> Anyway, this is off-topic.

[10:21:41] <wfpkhc> the computer is a Dell Inspirion 600m
[10:21:57] * wfpkhc hides in shame as his poverty will not allow him to have better hardware
[10:22:03] <alkisg> Debian 11 can boot with 512 MB RAM. The problem is the Internet; any recent browser and any recent site with lots of javascript wouldn't really work with 512. While you could still run local programs like abiword or gnumeric

[10:22:25] <alkisg> Ah right he was in #ubuntu yesterday as well :)
[10:22:59] <jelly> wfpkhc: debian 5 is too old to have modern TLS, even if it worked you'd ahve to use it mostly for offline things

[10:23:43] <wfpkhc> i will grab 7 and usb it
[10:23:57] <wfpkhc> it runs debian 11 but its sluggish
[10:24:11] <sussudio> what's the point of even trying to get that working on the internet with 512MB.
[10:24:16] <wfpkhc> would 7 be more "faster"?
[10:24:21] <wfpkhc> or am i barking up the wrong tree?
[10:24:37] <wfpkhc> the point is im poor and its all i have
[10:24:43] <alkisg> The problem is the internet. It's heavier these days  than 10 years ago.

[10:39:07] <dpkg> You can install Debian from a USB stick/thumbdrive/pen drive/key on x86 systems, as long as your system's BIOS can boot from USB.

[11:23:13] <jelly> wfpkhc: if you have a cheap usb stick it won't survive an ext4 filesystem and swap on it for too long.  If you have an external hdd or ssd, that would probably work longer term
[11:24:23] <jelly> to avoid any _additional_ resources starving, forget about using live usb images.  Install to disk.
[11:25:55] <n4dir> there are none debian live images you can load into RAM.
[11:26:58] <jelly> they don't need to load them completely into ram, but live uses RAM for disk space even without that option
[11:27:18] <wfpkhc> ok
[11:27:32] <wfpkhc> well installing to the hdd is not an option at the moment
[11:27:34] <wfpkhc> which is sad
[11:28:05] <n4dir> jelly: i wouldn't know. On my usually crap hardware, that is an option if i need a live (but that is really years ago. I gave up on it)

[11:30:45] <jelly> wfpkhc: it's extra slow if you're using a live image.

[12:14:19] <cadmio> then since there's also a dependence on gtk I'd like to install gtk4
[12:14:31] <cadmio> this could lead to more troubles
[12:15:04] <jelly> cadmio: that's just a library, do you have an app to use it?
[12:15:52] <Khepra> cadmio: do it in a container so you don't worry about breaking the system
[12:16:01] *** Joins: berkhan (~berkhan@159.146.40.242)
[12:16:14] <cadmio> my program doesn't work well with gtksourceview 4 (there's a bug in it) so I'd like to switch to v. 5
[12:16:16] <Khepra> jelly: s/he has a custom program that needs gtksourceview5 because <reasons> and that in turn needs >=gtk+3.99
[12:16:34] <jelly> make that container sid, which probably has the newer versions of stuff by now
[12:16:38] <Khepra> so that's at least two custom libs to be built and potentially colide with the system
[12:16:49] <Khepra> no, both versions still aren't in sid, not even exp
[12:17:07] <jelly> sid will still be a better starting point probably
[12:17:12] <Khepra> probably, yea
[12:17:33] <Khepra> although there's a lot of caveats with taht too
[12:17:46] <cadmio> what do you mean by make the container sid"?

[12:18:51] <Khepra> I use systemd-nspawn for my builder containers (building 64&32 bit packages, for bullseye and buster), works like a charm, easy to use
[12:18:52] <jelly> set up a chroot, nspawn, schroot or something else with debian unstable running inside it.  Avoid installing stuff on your real installation.

[12:19:47] <jelly> lxc?  full vm?  even... docker?  :)
[12:20:14] <Khepra> docker is designed for single (master) process application environment. people treating it like a VM with a shell or ssh login are abusing it.
[12:21:03] *** Quits: search_social (~search_so@99-112-18-250.lightspeed.hstntx.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[12:21:05] <Khepra> nspawn is easiest because it's already there and is a single line to enter it. lxc requires some setup. lxd is a snap. VM is easy to break as well and then you need to loopmount its fs to fix, blah blah blah
[12:21:48] <jelly> I still have chroots :-\
[12:22:21] <jelly> can you run debian 5 in nspawn and let systemd manage 4-5 services inside?
[12:22:34] <n4dir> i am not sure yet that cadmio did understand the reason *why* one would backport packages in some form of a "chroot", while he gets explained the how to do it
[12:22:34] <Khepra> debootstrap sid /path/to/container/root ; <wait until it's done> ;  systemd-nspawn -D /path/to/container/root ;         that's all there is to it.    then setup sources.list (default is just main, no updates no security), apt update, apt install devscripts build-essential, and begin porting
[12:23:53] <jelly> cadmio: avoid installing much newer versions of libraries in the main system, because that might break existing software if files or library soname-s are clashing.
[12:23:57] <Khepra> n4dir: if that's the case, then all this is moot and requires some serious teaching and learning, which is out of scope and bandwidth of IRC support
[12:24:19] <jelly> n4dir: I'm not suggesting backporting at all, just run the new stuff inside a separate env
[12:24:31] <n4dir> jelly: ah. Yeah, or that.
[12:24:35] <cadmio> in /usr/share there are two directories one for gtksourceview3 and one for v.4 so if things are kept separated I could as well install gtksourceview5
[12:24:46] <n4dir> I only wanted to make sure cadmio knows what all this is about.
[12:25:11] <Khepra> cadmio: yes, you could, containers are not a hard dependency. they're just a safety net so you don't blow up your system with a root "make install"
[12:25:26] <jelly> cadmio: maybe.  Or maybe Debian took steps to separate the paths, and make them coinstallable, that upstream did not.
[12:28:11] <Khepra> technically, containers have no reason to exist. code can be isolated, separted, partitioned, soname versioned, mandatory access controlled,  without a peep of namespacing in sight.

[14:52:24] <Khepra> what I'm after is limiting upload bandwith OR making it fair among queues. I'm on limited upload, very assymetric DSL. think 20MBps down and 1MBps up. Whenever I have upload, it hogs EVERYTHING.
[14:52:44] <jelly> it did help with that, back when it worked
[14:53:13] <Khepra> I tried manual sfqs but that ultimately didn't work as I expected, despite initial appearance of things being fixed

[16:55:38] <Khepra> then login, install firmware-misc-nonfree, it should auto-update initramfs (if it doesn't,   update-initramfs -u -k all), and reboot

[17:24:58] <Khepra> !ssb
[17:24:58] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[17:25:29] <Khepra> it's also possible such older nvidia driver has upper limit on linux kernel version and it won't be possible to even build it from source

[17:26:43] <jstolarek> I was also thinking about updating to bullseye in hopes that newer nouveau works but that's a one-way road
[17:27:21] <PerfDave> jstolarek: Try running bullseye on a USB drive or something, see if that works?
[17:27:34] <jstolarek> PerfDave: yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks
[17:27:55] <Khepra> use the firmware image tho
[17:27:58] <Khepra> !firmware images

[17:40:06] <PerfDave> It's all from base-files in Debian 11 by the look of it
[17:40:20] <PerfDave> Khepra: Heh, I was just thinking it was great to have it on Debian finally!
[17:40:38] <Khepra> PerfDave: yes but you still need pam integration for login's autogen of motd, and on ubuntu (where that originated) that's dynamic motd under run
[17:41:00] <Khepra> PerfDave: how often do you login to your systems in a way where motd is presented :)
[17:42:10] <Khepra> also, achievement unlocked when ubuntu pings third party URLs whenever you login so you get promotions and ads in motd.....

[21:21:08] <berkhan> Hi channel! I have one external hard drive where I store everything in tarballs. I am really tired of creating or maintaing scripts every single time. I looked solutions like dejavu, duplicity et. al. however I found that they are too much for my backup need. I know I can use btrfs but I don't know where to start therefore I skipped that. Could you give me some idea on how I can backup my /home directory?
[21:21:16] <tjcarter> jmd left, but the reason that's not working is because it's sort of not what update-alternatives is intended for
[21:21:33] <berkhan> I have no issue about configurations because those are managed by Ansible and git repositories
[21:21:33] <tjcarter> Unless he's making a Debian package out of a theme.

[21:24:45] <berkhan> tjcarter: I tarball each directory that is in my machine and put them in external drive
[21:26:07] <tjcarter> okay so /home, /var, /usr, etc?
[21:26:52] <berkhan> tjcarter: /home is the target directory. /etc is taken care by Ansible. /var and /usr: I don't touch them
[21:27:34] <berkhan> btrfs snapshot is so tempting to use but I don't want to learn _right now_
[21:28:08] <berkhan> I can format my external drive as btrfs but I don't know the outcome
[21:28:10] <tjcarter> wait, you're trying to deploy stuff to /home ? I thought your goal was backing up /home to an external drive.
[21:28:55] <berkhan> tjcarter: the goal is backing up /home to ext4 formated external drive :-)
[21:29:12] <tjcarter> okay! that's what I thought you were doing before. That makes sense.
[21:29:12] <berkhan> sorry I for misunderstanding
[21:29:26] <tjcarter> And you have tarballs with different snapshots?
[21:29:48] <tjcarter> 2021-10-31.tar, 2021-01-01.tar, etc ?
[21:30:00] <berkhan> Yes, timestamp-firefox, thunderbird, Documents...
[21:31:07] <tjcarter> Are you familiar with Apple Time Machine?
[21:31:19] <berkhan> I heard about it
[21:31:53] <tjcarter> The idea is that the first time you use it, it creates a timestamp directory for the thing to be backed up
[21:32:26] <tjcarter> each time thereafter, it creates hardlinks to the original files if unchanged, or copies the files anew if changed.
[21:32:44] <tjcarter> it's NOT a minimal backup, but it is maximally useful
[21:33:10] <tjcarter> you don't have to figure out which backup has the file you need if it hasn't been changed in however long.
[21:33:18] <tjcarter> rsync can basically do this.
