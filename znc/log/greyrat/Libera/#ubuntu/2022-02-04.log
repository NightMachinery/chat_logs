[02:47:40] <bray90820> tomreyn: I disabled them and yes it still happens
[02:49:33] <tomreyn> bray90820: from a quick glance, there were no critical messages about amdgpu on your log. and since it only affects the fock, i suspect it's more likely something in the gnome domain

[06:11:00] <tomreyn> fortunately soemeone guessed right in that you're talking http/https (apparently)
[06:11:14] <Guest74> Does anyone have any experience with Ubuntu Advantage subscription portal?
[06:11:29] <Guest74> under "UA Infra - Essential (Virtual)" it says 11 Machines
[06:11:47] <Guest74> does that mean I can attach up to 11 VMs to my subscription?
[06:11:51] <tomreyn> Canonical commercial support does
[06:12:00] <Guest74> or that i already have attached 11 machines to my subscription?
[06:13:06] <Guest74> I tried calling support but their phone quality was really bad and was cutting out every second word. I eventually got disconnected by the operator

[06:17:24] <rdr> so on my snap package, it shows the home directory as /home/335/, any ideas?
[06:17:49] <rdr> or rather... 335 is the directory name
[06:18:11] <rdr> actually, it's /home/rdr/snap/fluffychat/335/
[06:18:14] <webchat18> bigbianarch https://pastebin.com/s25BsFRW

[17:34:47] <tomreyn> taholmes160: this defaults to wayland. you can change it in gdm's configuration file for gdm, and on the gdm session chooser for the actual desktop session
[17:34:49] <KBar> ice9: generally you don't want to disable it, unless you're on a data plan

[19:46:48] <Rumen> I would like to ask something. I have old 2 TB hdd and it start show bad sectors, so I think to get a new one, but I'm stuck in choice to get a SSD or HDD, one friend told me to get both and use the SSD for the OS and the HDD for backup, but to move the VAR/LOG to the HDD - is that right?

[19:49:51] <jhutchins> Rumen: Most of the advice for moving /var/log is because it gets lots of continuous writes, which can "wear out" an SSD.  This advice is based on early designs for SSSs, which are now pretty close to being as durable as spinning discs.
[19:50:03] <jpmh> when I sign in Ubuntu tells me that a restart is required, if indeed there has been an upgrade that needs it.  What file is the login process using to determine that this restart is required?  I'd like to check for it myself
[19:50:05] <jhutchins> Rumen: You are likely to out-grow an SSD before it wears out.
[19:50:12] <Rumen> Yes, but if I keep the log and cache on the SSD will read and writte non stop and will die pretty quickly, right?

[21:37:02] <Sven_vB> bigbamboozle, so you did an update via network, and now network is unresponsive?
[21:38:30] <Sven_vB> or is "the connect" some device?
[21:38:34] <bigbamboozle> Sven_vB - yes... via a terminal on my desktop
[21:39:16] <bigbamboozle> oh sorry my bad - the server doesn't connect to the network via wired cable
[21:39:35] <Sven_vB> I guess your "desktop" means another computer that has a display and keyboard, and "terminal" is some kind of remote control software?
[21:39:58] <Sven_vB> bigbamboozle, what's your fallback access method? how do you usually get a shell in case network fails?
[21:41:13] *** Joins: ice9 (~ice9@user/ice9)
[21:41:15] <bigbamboozle> I logged in via ssh from a terminal on my desktop, yes. and the server booted to a command line as it usually does and i am signed in directly with a keyboard attached to the server.

[21:42:32] <Sven_vB> regedit, the prompt is probably obscured by log messages. type enter a few times.

[21:42:46] <bigbamboozle> bye piotr
[21:42:53] <Sven_vB> bigbamboozle, oh I see, so you have a keyboard and display on the server now? then I probably misunderstood "headless"

[21:46:18] <Sven_vB> also for that kind of debugging, it's really useful to have a pair of cheap USB UARTs that you can use as a nullmodem replacement.

[21:46:42] <Sven_vB> bigbamboozle, that means NM has no network profiles configured. configure one.

[23:16:57] <blauwal> Hello, I would appreciate help with wine. I'm running a configuration software for a AIS-transponder connected via usb. When I try to connect to the device, an error message pops up: Serial ports can't be opened, probably used by another application. I've followed the advice in the wineHQ wiki: added myself to group "dialout", created a new entry in the registry.
[23:17:17] <regedit> was trying to tell the previous developer from day 1... but he's too used to spinning up another VPS for every little project...

[23:18:35] <Maik> blauwal: probably best to ask at #winehq
[23:18:53] <blauwal> What I'm confused about is that "lsusb" lists the device on USB port 3. Looking at ~/.wine/dosdevices/, however, there is no COM port connected to /dev/ttyUSB0, only COM33 -> /dev/ttyACM0. What's wrong?
[23:19:27] <blauwal> Maik: Thanks, I hadn't been aware of their channel. Will try there.
