[01:16:35] <icar> Hello, there seems to be some packaging error. `wireplumber` conflicts with `pipewire-media-session` 
[01:16:48] <icar> But they don't have any conflicting files
[01:16:51] <Namarrgon> Alison40: did you add the nvme workaround?
[01:17:15] <grawity> they probably conflict deliberately so that you wouldn't have both running and managing the same pipewire instance?
[01:17:35] <grawity> similar to how pipewire-pulse, for some weird reason, conflicts with pulseaudio at package level instead of service level
[01:18:06] <icar> I mean, you can have more than one network daemon installed but you are responsible for enabling one service only. Same for pipewire session managers
[01:18:20] <Namarrgon> dvzrv: ^
[01:18:43] <grawity> yes but still I'd say that's a "packaging decision" (whether reasonable or not is another topic) and not so much a "packaging error"
[01:20:36] <Alison40> Namarrgon it's stopping at "Starting File System Check on /dev/d•/e9ab115-698d-499f-8d23-251444c39ac6..."

[02:27:45] <SponiX> lol... reminds me, I haven't made a backup in a long while now, I should run that

[02:29:23] <pisceswolf96> keir: looks nice 
[02:29:26] <Repentinus> Don't stick your credentials in a config file. Use a password manager and make your config query that password manager for the credential.
[02:30:43] <pisceswolf96> Repentinus: how would you do that exactly, because tiny(IRC client) wants to store its login credentials in the config file
[02:30:48] <keir> chezmoi has encryption features built it
[02:30:52] <SponiX> So, if I use a "dot file manager" of sorts, it will keep backups of my config, and also share them for me, while taking out sensitive information in the process ?

[02:32:27] <thrice> I think weechat does too, fwiw
[02:32:39] <Repentinus> Sane = either built-in support for libsecret or support for populating the username and password variables from a shell command.
[02:32:41] <SponiX> pisceswolf96: not sure about the clients "sanity" but hexchat is pretty damn simple, and does well for me
[02:33:04] <keir> weechat encrypts the config with a passphrase
[02:33:15] <keir> if you use /secure
[02:33:21] <thrice> ah
[02:33:24] <umaxtu> I keep meaning to write a little utility than can censor files before uploading them to github. and go in the opposite direction. been dragging by feet on starting it
[02:33:25] <pisceswolf96> Repentinus yeah it doesn't have that. It's still rather new
[02:33:25] <Repentinus> thrice, WeeChat does it by default, but the config is powerful enough to allow storing credentials in a password manager.
[02:33:38] <mingdao> pisceswolf96: Mine is 547 lines, so I can understand that.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  However, it's terribly easy to read; and good docs on irssi.org

[02:34:48] <pisceswolf96> thrice: Does it support vim keys?

[10:05:04] <remanifest> Hey all, I'm using OpenVPN 2.5.4. When I connect to the VPN from NetworkManager, the connection is successful, but once the connection is active, none of my traffic is routed to the internet. This same connection (using the same ovpn config file) is working successfully on macOS, so I know the connection itself is fine. Any tips on where I can start with troubleshooting?
[10:05:07] *** Quits: Dark (~dark@user/dark) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[10:05:20] <remanifest> When I connect via openvpn3, the connection is also successful, but in that case, my "main" connection still works - the tunnel just isn't getting picked up. I'd prefer to use openvpn3 fwiw.

[10:21:53] <Ingar> I updated my system yesterday and now I get the most funky sshs key errors
[10:22:34] <Ingar> e.g. "key refused" in putty, while the exact same key works fine from another arch client

[11:35:20] <rien333> I use packages I would like to have a manpage for. Debian ships these packages with a manpage generated by `help2man`, since upstream doesn't generate them.

[14:16:56] <stef204> hi, running into a dependency chicken and egg situation: when trying to update system, pacman _s ffmpeg: "installing libvpx (1.11.0-1) breaks dependency 'libvpx.so=6-64' required by thunderbird" and the other way around:pacman -S thunderbird "installing libvpx (1.11.0-1) breaks dependency 'libvpx.so=6-64' required by ffmpeg"
[14:17:34] <stef204> yet there is a new release on official thunderbird to fix this, although I seem not to be able to install it: https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/commit/5b344a9a1101d31a9aa33410c16c7a1abc41652a#diff-3e341d2d9c67be01819b25b25d5e53ea3cdf3a38d28846cda85a195eb9b7203a
[14:18:03] <thrice> what version of thunderbird is trying to be installed?
[14:18:18] <Namarrgon> why are you reinstalling ffmpeg?
[14:18:23] <stef204> well, the newest one 91.2.1-1
[14:18:47] <stef204> Namarrgon:not really trying to, but trying to see how to get around this cycle

[14:21:35] <mpan> 91.2.1 is fine here, but libvpx has also been updated around that time. So something doesn’t add up.
[14:22:31] <mpan> Updating libvpx to 1.11.0-1 should make installing thunderbird 91.2.1-1 work.

[14:24:52] <thrice> you have it set to ignorepkg ?
[14:24:54] <stef204> I also thought it was a mirror problem and used "reflector" a couple of times to try to see if mirrors used were not updated but no joy
[14:24:55] <Namarrgon> you can't run arch like that
[14:25:46] <mpan> Oo… a partial upgrade.

[14:26:20] <thrice> you have an IgnorePkg that is a mile long

[14:27:24] <stef204> just not every single package automatically
[14:27:31] <Namarrgon> your current thunderbird problem is caused by your ignore list

[14:30:09] <thrice> because you configured pacman to not update
[14:30:20] <stef204> pacman will give an error, TB is in ignore list, do you want to upgrade it? and choose "yes"

[21:01:01] <remanifest> So is Kubuntu using IPP to broadcast the printer's availability? And you can access it from other devices?
[21:01:57] <h4rd3n3D> 3 questions, 2 answers.  jiriks74 , no one taught you about tab autocomplete?
[21:02:59] <jiriks74> It should be. Though cups on my pc are saying they'll use dnssd (for looking it up?) and some hostname
[21:03:13] <jiriks74> <h4rd3n3D> Sorry, yes yes and yes
[21:03:24] <h4rd3n3D> k
[21:05:09] <jiriks74> The drivers are weird though. From what I understand I should be able to add the printer without any drivers, that gets handled by the server, right?
