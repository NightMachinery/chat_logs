[00:02:21] <caze> Dean: Yes, max_value could have either the value 42 or 52.
[00:02:37] <Dean> caze: so what i understand, is that they are saying, they don't know what is called first, f or g. Due to interleaving.?
[00:02:52] <caze> Dean: Interleaving is a separate issue.
[00:03:26] <caze> Dean: It even says, "f and g do not interleave".

[00:03:44] <Dean> let me reread it before i ask more potato questions.
[00:04:01] <caze> Dean: What this example illustrates is sequence of operations, or the lack thereof in this case.

[00:07:58] <Dean> caze: oh. i thought it meant it will either call f or g and run whichever is called first to completion. so it won't process part of f and then go to g.

[00:12:02] <Dean> caze: f and g use 'sequencing' so f will be called first and then g will be called? only with unsequenced operations do you get interleaving?
[00:13:55] <Dean> caze: like this is unsequenced printf("%d\n", ++i + ++j * --k); but order of operations still occur.
[00:13:57] <caze> Dean: Well, function calls are a special case.
[00:14:19] <caze> > caze: oh. i thought it meant it will either call f or g and run whichever is called first to completion. so it won't process part of f and then go to g.
[00:14:22] <caze> That is correct.
[00:14:40] <caze> > caze: f and g use 'sequencing' so f will be called first and then g will be called? only with unsequenced operations do you get interleaving?
[00:14:43] <caze> That is not correct.
[00:14:53] <Dean> thank you caze
[00:16:11] <Dean> caze: i think i understand. interleaving is an 'attempt' at efficiency, but it is not always faster (perhaps coincidentally so). it's just another way of implementing a compiler.
[00:17:10] <caze> Dean: There is a subtle difference between "implementing a compiler", and "prescribing the behavior that a compiler must follow".

[00:20:48] <nitrix> I don't want to discourage you from asking questions, but I'm baffled how even with the correct context and deliberately precise answers, you manage to ask questions that shows a misunderstanding.
[00:21:39] <nitrix> I wonder whether you're battling to undo previous misconceptions or moving too fast while jumping to conclusions too quickly.
[00:22:45] <nitrix> Something in your learning process/methodology is amiss and I can't pinpoint it yet.
[00:22:49] <Dean> nitrix: i think i just have a low iq. i am slow. because i was always too shy to ask questions. english is not my best language either. so i think a mix of both.
[00:23:52] <nitrix> That's perfectly understandable if that's a language barrier :) I have a harder time believing the low iq problem.

[00:46:32] <Dean> nitrix: i don't want to bother you but i just want to clarify that i understood your previous messages. you spoke about mergings two 'sets' in various ways. these sets are operations? like the zipper explanation. just as long as they keep their order it is interleaved correctly. i said 'stream' earlier, but i think i meant 'thread'.

[01:00:14] <caze> Dean: I didn't mean that specifically in the context of interleaving. I meant that generally, the C language specification document prescribes behaviors. It does not prescribe *how* to produce those behaviors.
[01:00:39] <caze> In other words, it tells *what* to implement. It doesn't say *how* to implement.

[01:07:06] *** Quits: CodeAgain (~codeagain@user/CodeAgain) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:07:22] <caze> Dean: To do so would be interleaving, which is prohibited by the spec.
[01:07:54] <Dean> caze: ok thank you. i appreciate it.
[01:08:13] <caze> Dean: This requirement is specific to functions though.
[01:08:29] <caze> Dean: My earlier example (a = b) + (c = d) does not have this requirement.

[01:10:44] *** Quits: alex11 (~alex11@user/alex11) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[01:12:11] <caze> Dean: But as I said, the "no interleaving of function calls" is a "what" requirement. In other words, as long as the external behavior is the same, the specification does not care *how* it is done.
[01:12:56] <caze> Dean: So in fact, a compiler *could* interleave the two function calls, as long as the output is such that they do not appear to be interleaved.
[01:14:02] <caze> Dean: For instance a compiler could produce identical translations for https://ideone.com/k7UCQ5 and https://ideone.com/zoMNut but interleave the calls for the latter.

[01:41:41] <nitrix> Having a set of things and merging them in different ways is all very abstract. You can choose the things to be anything and the merge can be more involved that just thinking in terms of sets or elements.
[01:43:12] <nitrix> Once you understanding it, you can reason what interleaving instructions would imply, or interleaving writes to stdout, or interleaving network packets.

[05:07:30] <tusko> TIL
[05:08:28] <fizzie> `char *argv[]` is what the standard uses (C11 5.1.2.2.1p1), so it's arguably got some sort of official stamp of approval, but it mentions `char **argv` as an alternative (footnote 10).
[05:08:54] <fizzie> (They're equivalent specifically as function parameter declarations, not anywhere else.)
[05:08:56] <ski> `char *argv' would be wrong
[05:09:33] <orbisvicis> heh the library upstream was completely rewritten and no longer has the issue

[08:05:42] <Maxdamantus> Do you know about ptrace or strace?
[08:05:59] <Maxdamantus> Or do you mean libc library calls?
[08:06:55] <while> I know about strace and ptrace, they don't work on NFS, and I don't think it works on other kernel threads
[08:07:16] <while> I'm talking about calls documented in the `man 2` section
[08:08:01] <while> last time I intercepted linux syscalls, I never did successfully intercept `man 2 fcntl` without issue
[08:08:51] <Maxdamantus> Well, if you want to introspect what the kernel itself is doing, you need to debug the kernel. Can't be done by intercepting some call in userspace.
[08:09:33] <Maxdamantus> There's some way to attach gdb to Linux, and there might be various ad-hoc debugging interfaces exposed through sysfs or something.
[08:09:43] <while> no, I would be changing the memory permissions on the kernel memory portion reserved for kernel space system calls, intended to be invoked by userspace programs
[08:09:58] <while> and the scribbling over them, I've done it before with non-variable-argument syscalls

[08:10:39] <while> <Maxdamantus> I did speak for a while in #linux about using gdb and strace to look into NFS server, but the consensus was that it was impossible with NFS Server as written because it is a kernel thread
[08:10:40] <Maxdamantus> How do you think the question in the stackoverflow helps with your goal?
[08:10:48] <while> it talks about var arg interception
[08:11:05] <while> which is my *real* issue I'm having
[08:11:22] <while> the forwarding of variable arguments to non-vararg variable argument calls, such as fcntl
[08:11:23] <dave0> maw
[08:11:31] <Maxdamantus> Are you trying to write code that is run in userspace or in kernel space?
[08:11:57] <while> kernel space, once the userspace program begins waiting for the kernel space thread processing the syscall completes
[08:12:20] <while> it will be a kernel module, plenty is written on how to intercept non-vararg syscalls
[08:12:26] <while> that part is easy on linux
[08:13:12] <while> my program will be immune to `kill -s 9` when I want it to be, like those evil sadistic NFS Server devs made their little project

[12:55:26] <pony> where's the code we're looking at?

[13:13:59] <dave0> apple75: if you want to build a string, you can use ,{asprintf}

[13:27:41] <ski> greeter : oh, and i should also add that that paste does add a trailing space to each line. if you swap the two `strcat' calls, it'd instead add an initial space to each line. to only add spaces inbetween the tokens, you'd either have to add a conditional that only adds the space if you're not at the start/end, or you'd have to unwind one round of the loop, treating the first token of each line specially (and only
[13:27:47] <ski> add a space if you're not overflowing)

[13:29:52] <ski> (downside of the conditional is that it runs every round, but most times it'd chose the one space alternative. downside of the unwinding is that you're repeating code)
[13:30:19] <greeter> ah i didn't even think of that. i guess i should have tried a printing character instead of a space at some point

[13:31:29] <ski> (hm, i guess you could `goto' into the loop, just after adding a space, at the beginning (and at each line wrap-around) .. that would solve both the inefficiency and the repetition issue .. but it'd look uglier (be harder to comprehend), due to the `goto' ..)
[13:32:13] <greeter> ah yes, i'd rather have nicer looking code even if it's a bit more inefficient

[13:32:57] <ski> well, in some sense, avoiding repetition is still nicer (than not avoiding it), even if `goto' is not that nice
[13:33:29] <dave0> char *space = ""; for(token = strtok(string, " "); token != 0; token = strtok(0, " ")) { printf("%s%s", space, token); space = " "; }
[13:33:39] <dave0> no if in that

[13:36:14] <greeter> this is quickly starting to get over my head unfortunately. i have to get some sleep now. everyone's been hugely helpful though :-D thank you
[13:37:06] <ski> greeter : btw, are you sure `player.location->short_desc' and `player.location->long_desc' are strings of length at most `799' ? otherwise, you might want to use `strncpy'
[13:37:48] <greeter> ah good idea. i did temporarily make them bigger to test this out, but i think i need the longer strings now
[13:40:43] * ski would probably also pass `player', and perhaps also `stdscr', as parameter to `display'

[13:58:11] <apple75> I'm trying to receive a string from the user, so asprintf does not work. I wont know the length ahead of time, and I want to avoid VLAs if I can. So from what I can see, I need to malloc or realloc. Would if be fine to malloc to some predefined size, and then realloc if the input turns out to be larger than the allocated size?
[13:59:06] <dave0> apple75: that's correct
[13:59:20] <apple75> Thanks! Thats probably what ill end up doing
[13:59:25] <dave0> apple75: but there is also getline() which does it for you.. i believe it's in posix, but posix is on topic for c
[14:00:36] <dave0> yeah it's getline .. it has a stupid interface, but it will read an arbitrarily long line

[14:05:56] <dave0> and the name is too generic, it breaks k&r
[14:05:59] <dave0> the book
[14:06:10] <markand> quick question, there is a rule that {0} in initializer will set all fields to 0 but looks like when using !0 it only applies to the first element: https://ideone.com/OcFZQH
[14:06:19] <edk> loads of names break k&r
[14:06:36] <dave0> edk: then those names are a bug too
[14:06:42] <markand> if dealing with an array of pointers, will {NULL} set all elements to NULL or I should use {0} as well? (e.g. const char *tab[5] = {NULL})
[14:06:47] <edk> dave0: i don't think so
[14:06:58] <k> loads of nicks break on &
[14:07:04] <dave0> markand: use   ={0}   it always works
[14:07:16] <twkm> {0} only explicitly initializes the first element, the rest are implicitly initialized (to zero).
[14:07:29] <dave0> markand: if you initialize any, the rest are automatically initialized too (to 0)
[14:07:31] <twkm> similarly {1} only explicitly initializes the first element, the rest are implicitly initialized (to zero).
[14:07:40] <dave0> hey twkm :-)
[14:07:40] <edk> {NULL} *will* set all elements to NULL but not for the reason you think
[14:07:51] <markand> oh okay I get it
[14:07:54] <twkm> hmm, NULL.
[14:08:04] <markand> it's similar to designated initializers where missing fields are zero'ed
[14:08:10] <edk> yes
[14:08:32] <markand> I just remember that a few years ago that the compiler emitted some warnings like "missing initializers for ..."
[14:08:46] <dave0> you know what they say about warnings...
[14:08:58] <edk> most compilers special-case {0} for those warnings as they know it's used as a universal initializer
[14:09:14] <markand> hopefully now C23 has a dedicated = {} thingy
[14:09:31] <dave0> well it saves a single character... i guess it's good
[14:09:34] <markand> :P
[14:09:34] <edk> to be honest i don't mind {0}

[20:52:51] <fizzie> SaltHilStroller_: What's wrong in your example is that the preprocessing token `EVENT` is only replaced when it appears directly in the body ("replacement list") of the `#define LIST(EVENT) ...`. When it's inside the expansion of a different macro (like FOO), that's too late: the rescanning for further replacement only happens *after* parameters have been gone and done with.

[22:05:39] <fizzie> Well, it's a *little* more complicated than that, when signed and unsigned types get involved. For example, in the relatively common case where `long` and `long long` are both 64-bit types, `unsigned long` + `long long` promotes to `unsigned long long`, even though that isn't even one of the "input" types.
