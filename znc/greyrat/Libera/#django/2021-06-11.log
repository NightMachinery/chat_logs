[16:09:04] <zamba> i want to create a matrix of results.. i have a set of runners and a set of runs.. not every runner participates in every run, but most of them do.. i now want to output a matrix showing the results for each of the runs as the columns and each of the runners as the rows.. then the result for each run should be the cells.. the rows should be sorted according to the last result
[16:09:12] <zamba> if a runner has no result for a given run, then it should just be empty
[16:09:28] <zamba> the model is quite simple:
[16:09:55] <zamba> https://dpaste.org/hkHR
[16:10:50] <zamba> so what i see as the challenges are: sorting the runners rows based on the last result (the last run) and also creating the empty cells for the runners with no result in a given run
[16:13:03] *** Joins: ThanatosJ (~Thanatos@197.210.64.146)
[16:18:18] <GinFuyou> I'm looking at attendance book I once made, but apparently I solved empty cells issue creating attendance records unconditionally
[16:19:31] <GinFuyou> So student always have attendance record for every lesson, but it can have grade or marks for "unattended" "canceled" "sick leave" etc
[16:19:51] <GinFuyou> But data structure for it was significantly more complex
[16:20:23] <GinFuyou> I guess you could just check every cell against parent loop
[16:22:34] <zamba> i'm also wondering how to create my context data
[16:23:08] <GinFuyou> Table includes all Runs ?
[16:23:10] <zamba> since i want to have one for loop in the template to create the column headers (which should be the runs).. and then i have to have another for loop inside each runner's row to iterate over the same runs
[16:23:13] <GinFuyou> Or only subset?
[16:23:14] <zamba> it should
[16:23:30] <zamba> the table should include all runs, yes
[16:24:07] <GinFuyou> Ok, so a queryset\list of Runs, and queryset of Runners with prefetched results
[16:24:19] <GinFuyou> Doesn't sound too complex so far
[16:24:30] <zamba> how do you suggest doing that in the view?
[16:25:07] <zamba> so you mean two querysets.. one for the runs and one for the results?
[16:26:08] *** Quits: azed (~azed@160.159.122.89) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[16:26:45] <GinFuyou> No, second one for runners. You will pull records from each runner
[16:26:51] <GinFuyou> *results
[16:27:31] <GinFuyou> So parent loop for runner in runners, nested is: for result in runner.results.all
[16:28:04] <GinFuyou> That's assumes runners have a single or none results for every run

[16:49:07] <pycode> yes i am talking about forms.py hmmm ok i am asking because as i wrote before i am trying to organize the code so that way i suppose that i should only move the templates/ folder and maybe templatetags/ outside my core app...and then form the views/ inside core app i will point to the templates inside the theme app...but others things like, models, forms.py tasks.py etc i will leave them on "core" app

[16:52:27] <pycode> i mean...ok i CAN have multiple layouts inside the same app that are using their own static folders too but...seems complicated and confusing
[16:53:14] <pycode> or better....uncommon, no?
[16:54:20] <GinFuyou> Confusing\not confusing is better criteria in designing code layout I think. Ofc it's still pretty subjective
[16:55:49] <pycode> GinFuyou, yes ok but i am asking what is the most common solution because if other django devs will work on this project i would like to make their life easier :)
[16:56:01] <pycode> so the question is...ok u have ThemeA and ThemeB
[16:56:16] <pycode> i will create two apps to hold different .html files with different design that must be shared
[16:56:19] <pycode> ok...now...
[16:56:51] <pycode> the views.py and forms.py must be related to the User's types i mean... Profiles will have their own forms, Agents their own forms and so on..
[16:56:55] <pycode> same thing for views.py
[16:57:28] <pycode> so the question is...is better to create an app for each type and then from there using the ThemeA or ThemeB
[16:57:50] <pycode> so for example i will have ThemeA/templates/agents/all_agent_related_files_here
[16:58:07] <pycode> but hold the views.py inside an app called Agent
[16:58:28] <pycode> or...should i put the views/forms inside ThemeA directly?
[16:58:46] <pycode> i think i should separated because a form is a form...and a view is a view...it is NOT relly related to the design
[16:58:54] <pycode> relly/really
[16:59:37] <pycode> but ok, if i need to separate is better to have an app called i do not know maybe User AND THERE put views_agents.py views_companies.py etc etc
[16:59:38] <pycode> ?
[17:00:04] <pycode> or put everything inside a CORE app and just leave the design separated into another app
[17:02:24] <pycode> GinFuyou, ^^ is for you hehe
[17:02:37] <GinFuyou> Presuming that user types still share some common features, it would probably be often useful to inherit their views\forms\models. So I would put all of them into same app based on this presumtion
[17:03:30] <GinFuyou> Just to make imports\inheritance less tangled
[17:04:26] <GinFuyou> If the code is completely difference, or inheritance can be done from single base set of classes
[17:04:38] <zamba> GinFuyou: invalid filter get_by_index
[17:04:50] <GinFuyou> zamba, yes, there is no such filter

[17:36:23] <zamba> is that filter match happening in the DOM?
[17:37:17] <zamba> ah.. result.run is not an index.. it's the __str__ of the Run

[17:43:22] <zamba> hm.. i'm not able to get this working
[17:43:28] <zamba> there's something in the template
[17:47:09] <zamba> {% for result in runner.result_set.all %}
[17:47:29] <zamba> this will iterate over each result, right.. but if that result run doesn't match the current run, then that is discarded
[17:48:21] <zamba> ah!
[17:49:50] <zamba> but it doesn't work for runners that have no previous result.. for instance if they have no result in the first run
[17:52:12] <zamba> ah, yes.. because they don't have querysets enough to match the number of columns/run

[21:34:16] <teut> the thing is,  you go to page 1 by  a get
[21:34:53] <teut> there you check few checkboxes and post the form,  now the   get_initial()  will get the data corresponding to the page 2 not page 1
[21:35:29] <teut> but that initial_data has to be for page1's  data
[21:39:18] <teut> I dont know if that was clear, but please  just tell  how  here, this function decides whether it has to give objects for page 1 or page 2 or p age3?  https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.list/ListView/#get_context_data

[23:58:58] <azlev> Hello all. I have an application with 2 databases, with different tables. When I run the test switch, django creates a transaction in the first, database, insert data in the second and teardown the tests performing a rollback in the first database leaving data behind. How can I instruct django to begin / rollback in the right database?
