[02:21:27] <kevr> is it?>
[02:22:28] <NoobAlice> You can set him up with Ubuntu and then he can use a GUI to add and remove packages.

[02:22:58] <docmax> The original author does not update

[05:34:54] <kevr> so, the more you know about those programs, the easier it will be to track down issues and understand problems.

[05:42:22] <ente_> can you use tiling window manager without having to do everything youself? I mean notifications, proper settings, polkit, keyring etc. I know you can just patch it together on your own but I would like something with a more consistent look and feel (like e.g. GNOME just with bspwm as the window manager) 
[05:43:18] <bfiedler> ente_: there are (used to be?) extensions in the window managers that allow you to do that
[05:44:09] <ente_> bfiedler: I just used this for now: https://github.com/shizonic/bspwm-gnome
[05:45:08] <NoobAlice> ente_: Xfce is know for working well with non-Xfce window managers, so you could use Xfce for all your settings, notifications, panel, etc. and a tiling window manager.
[05:45:29] <coruja> ente_: don't mix window managers and desktop environments, though you can make desktop environments use another window manager than the default one (with loss of functionality/integration mostly)

[05:47:12] <NoobAlice> ente_: Probably because the people who use pre-built DEs and the people who use keyboard-driven window managers is a pretty small cross-section.  I don't know of any DEs that default have a tiling WM... but I am a noob.
[05:47:17] <coruja> maybe because people using tiling wms prefer doing configuration on their own to fit their special needs

[14:14:08] <Foxboron> See the drawbacks server!
[14:14:22] <Foxboron> but it's the same threat model as just pulling random files from a server and signing them
[14:14:23] <WhyNotHugo> I did, that's made very clear too.
[14:14:33] <Foxboron> the key idea is to not expose the private key :)
[14:14:46] <JTL> glorified pseudo remote HSM :P

[20:23:49] <raster> susi: sounds like you have a very anal sandbox that is disallowing access to something that it probably should not disallow.
[20:25:07] <raster> access to that kind of file is used for things like doing your own backtraces of your own code - eg when there is a problem reporting the code path to get there. this is used to find out what library files were mapped to that region of memory (that then these can be used to do a proper symbol trace with filenames too)
[20:25:18] <raster> so ... fix your sandbox :)

[20:27:03] <susi> my 'sandboxes' are lsm=landlock,lockdown,yama,apparmor & lockdown=confidentiality, but the error isn't giving enough information. dmesg shows nothing
[20:28:05] <raster>  /proc/self/maps is pretty harmless to have access to. that data has ALREADY been maped into the memory space of the process.

[22:04:18] <susi> yes I understood, that's what I said.. probably means abcd... ABCD..

[22:06:09] <mpan> But that has nothing to do with options processing. It’s how a value passed as an option is interpreted. So I still don’t get the question. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
