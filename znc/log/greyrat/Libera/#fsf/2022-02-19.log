[01:18:01] <leah> clever: i have a question
[01:18:13] <clever> ask away
[01:18:19] <leah> vga is 31khz. tv signals are 15khz
[01:18:26] <leah> we both know this
[01:18:29] <leah> we also know:
[01:18:46] <leah> librerpi can do composite video 15khz and analog rgb at 31khz
[01:18:51] <leah> can it do 15khz rgb?
[01:19:10] <leah> rpi with librerpi hooked up to a PVM would be the absolute bees knees
[01:19:13] <clever> you can set pretty much any resolution and freq you want on the rgb
[01:19:22] <clever> from 1x1 to 4095x4095, at pretty much any pixel clock
[01:19:22] <leah> shame 6-bit though
[01:19:31] <leah> vga666 means it's 6bits per channel right?
[01:19:31] <clever> 6bit is only a limitation of the adapter board
[01:19:40] <clever> the rpi can do 8bit per channel
[01:19:41] <leah> is 24-bit possible
[01:19:46] <clever> yes!
[01:19:47] <leah> (8bits per channel)
[01:19:49] <leah> oh really?
[01:19:51] <clever> yep
[01:19:57] <leah> so why use vga666 then
[01:20:03] <leah> how do i get normal rgb
[01:20:05] <clever> fewer resistors on the adapter board
[01:20:07] <clever> "good enough"
[01:20:15] <leah> explain
[01:20:18] <leah> "few resistors"
[01:20:38] <clever> for the resistor DAC
[01:20:40] <leah> ok, maybe instead explain it another way:
[01:20:43] <leah> why is it 6-bit?
[01:20:47] <leah> what makes it 6-bit
[01:20:49] <clever> https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/images/dpi-packing.png
[01:20:52] <leah> surely the rpi's onboard dac is 8
[01:21:02] <clever> the DPI on the rpi can operate in any mode in this chart
[01:21:11] <leah> ok, so i can totally install some emulators on a rpi
[01:21:13] <clever> and those are all digital modes, no DAC
[01:21:27] <leah> and output it at 15khz 24-bit analog rgb
[01:21:36] <leah> and hook up to a pvm
[01:21:37] <clever> the vga666 board, is just making your own 6bit DAC with resistors
[01:21:43] <leah> ok
[01:21:47] <clever> but you can just use more resistors, or a proper 8bit DAC instead
[01:21:56] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[01:21:57] <leah> explain the latter
[01:22:08] <leah> so vga666 has its own onboard dac
[01:22:13] <leah> what type of signal is the source?
[01:22:15] <leah> hdmi?
[01:22:19] <clever> parallel digital
[01:22:39] <clever> the rpi just has 18 gpio pins, that carry the raw 666 digital color
[01:22:47] <leah> is it just 3 of those lines
[01:22:55] <clever> 18 lines for 666
[01:23:08] <leah> oh, i see
[01:23:12] <leah> it has no more than 18?
[01:23:20] <clever> yeah, it can do full 24bit output
[01:23:29] <leah> so, more than 18 then?
[01:23:32] <clever> yep
[01:23:35] <leah> ok
[01:24:06] <clever> if you check the link i gave above, when in 888 mode, you get red on gpio 20-27, green on 12-19, and blue on 4-11, 8 gpio pins per color
[01:24:25] <leah> what about sync
[01:24:26] <clever> just grab 3 8bit DAC's, wire em up, and deal with hsync/vsync, your done!
[01:24:35] <clever> https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/images/dpi-altfn2.png
[01:24:36] <leah> where does sync come from
[01:24:46] <clever> hsync, vsync, data-valid, and pixel-clock, are available on another 4 pins
[01:24:51] <clever> one pin for each signal
[01:24:57] <leah> clever: btw: https://minifree.org/resistordivider
[01:25:06] <leah> i say
[01:25:11] <leah> measure the analog output
[01:25:14] <leah> check it's the right voltage
[01:25:22] <clever> its always 3.3v out
[01:25:28] <leah> ok
[01:25:31] <leah> you need to tune that
[01:25:52] <leah> the *analog* side must be ideally 1.42v at 75ohm level
[01:26:04] <leah> that is, it must be that when going into the tv or monitor
[01:26:15] <leah> most/all monitors will have 75ohm termination in them
[01:26:18] <clever> https://github.com/fenlogic/vga666/blob/master/design_data/schematic/vga.gif
[01:26:26] <clever> this is the schematic for the vga666 board i was using
[01:26:37] <leah> you make sure to output at 1.42v then put 75ohm series
[01:26:44] <leah> and that divides it into 710mv
[01:27:02] <leah> tolerance (on rgb at 75ohm level) is 640-780mv

[01:28:04] <leah> but your 3.3v figure, that sounds like it's on the digital side
[01:28:17] <leah> which is correct there, assuming the dac runs at 3.3v
[01:29:28] <leah> resistors are fine
[01:29:36] <clever> yeah, the DPI is basically just 24bit parallel digital, each wire is either 0v or 3.3v
[01:29:39] <leah> that schematic looks ok
[01:29:47] <clever> each group of 8bits forms one color

[01:30:28] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[01:30:31] <clever> just looking at the vga666 schematic and guessing, if i shift all of those resistors over 2 bits, and add a 250ohm and a 125ohm resistor, i would get an 8bit dac
[01:30:36] <leah> and i say this:
[01:30:43] <leah> there's no ac coupling in that schematic
[01:30:51] <leah> analog rgb ought to be ac coupled
[01:30:55] <leah> 470uF
[01:30:55] <clever> ah
[01:31:07] <leah> anything 220-1000uF should be fine

[01:31:24] <leah> yeah you need to make sure
[01:31:26] <leah> also
[01:31:28] <clever> and this could explain why it functions in the way i observed
[01:31:28] <leah> low pass filter
[01:31:36] <leah> you should ideally put a low pass filter on the line
[01:31:39] <leah> i don't see that either
[01:31:51] <leah> clever: 3.3v per bit you say?
[01:31:56] <clever> yeah
[01:32:03] <clever> green-6 and green-7 are tied high in all of my demos, because i left the uart enabled
[01:32:04] <leah> i say then, mods to vga666 adapter:
[01:32:13] <clever> but the display behaves like they are tied low
[01:32:21] <clever> decoupling capacitors would perfectly explain that
[01:32:44] <leah> clever: once you have analog r g and b, feed them through resistor dividers tuning them to 710mV
[01:32:53] <leah> feed each signal into a THS7374

[01:33:25] <clever> oh, i have an rgb amp upstairs, one minute
[01:33:25] <leah> now, why THS7374 i say?
[01:33:44] <leah> THS7374 is a 4-line video driver with built-in LPF
[01:33:47] <leah> and a powerful one at that
[01:33:51] <leah> you can toggle it on or off

[01:43:41] <leah> could just probe the pins on the vga connector
[01:44:03] <leah> show me a photo of your scope's display too, for every signal
[01:44:06] <leah> ideally a video
[01:44:12] <leah> i want to see what it's doing
[01:44:30] <clever> let me rig it all up...
[01:44:35] <leah> cheers
[01:44:49] <leah> i'm interested because i want to know if that thing will blow up someone's monitor
[01:45:02] <leah> there are very exact standards for these signals
[01:45:25] <clever> i have heard that the wrong freq can blow things up
[01:45:37] <leah> ground reference obviously is the same ground on the vga connector
[01:45:38] <clever> but all of the vga displays i have access to will turn off when out of spec
[01:45:42] <leah> which i assume is just common ground anyway
[01:45:57] <clever> i also have a crt that actually shocks you if you touch vga gnd and pc gnd
[01:46:27] <leah> it might be two separate grounds maybe?
[01:46:45] <clever> i think the crt is leaking mains voltage into its chassis
[01:46:53] <clever> and it doesnt find a path to gnd until you plug it into the pc
[01:46:57] <leah> well that's not good
[01:47:01] <leah> oh, right
[01:47:07] <leah> still not good
[01:47:13] <clever> low current leakage, because nothing blows when you plug it in
[01:47:16] <clever> yeah
[01:47:35] <clever> that subject also came up on the pi forums recently, as the cause of death for a lot of pi's
[01:47:48] <leah> but i mean if you're poking around in a crt i assume you're either dead or you know what you're doing
[01:47:51] <clever> if the pi isnt plugged into power, its "ground" comes over the hdmi, possibly with that leakage
[01:48:00] <clever> this was with the crt fully assembled
[01:48:07] <clever> and it still leaked enough that you could feel it
[01:48:26] <leah> if it was from the flyback it'd probably kill you
[01:48:31] <leah> so probably was just 240v mains
[01:48:37] <clever> 120 here
[01:48:40] <leah> or 120v if you have split phase
[01:48:43] <leah> ok 120

[01:48:57] <clever> canada
[01:48:59] <leah> ok
[01:49:12] <leah> we europeans use single phase

[01:49:20] <damo22> Don't be talking about disassembling CRT monitors, that is very dangerous, for the younger viewers here, DONT TRY THAT AT HOME KIDS you will end up dead.
[01:49:31] <leah> you actually do have 240v over there in canada/usa btw

[01:49:42] <leah> but you have a split phase transformer at street level
[01:49:48] <leah> that's what feeds 120v into your home
[01:49:52] <clever> leah: the street poles are actually 7200vac phase to neutral, or 12470 phase to phase!
[01:50:17] <clever> and then the transformers just outside the house step it down to 2 or 3 phases of 120
[01:50:27] <leah> ok
[01:50:33] <clever> apartment buildings use 3 phase 120, and then each apartment gets 2 phases

[01:50:43] <clever> but they arent 180 out of phase, so they get a different 2 phase voltage
[01:50:58] <leah> which is
[01:51:00] <leah> why
[01:51:08] <leah> i don't understand why you would do that
[01:51:13] <clever> 240 vs 220
[01:51:22] <leah> it's less efficient
[01:51:41] <clever> a 3 phase transformer gives you 50% more capacity on the output side, vs a 2 phase with the same sized coils
[01:51:52] <clever> and sometimes thats all you need
[01:52:18] <leah> anyway, i'm probably heading off to bed in a bit
[01:52:27] <clever> let me boot the pi up and measure those things...

[01:55:05] <clever> so i can just throw a few lines in, and bam, done
[01:55:06] <leah> so i just grounded the cpu clock. shorted it. when it got to that. it crashed the cpu, but the picture would stay stuck on the screen
[01:55:09] <leah> then i'd measure
[01:55:11] <leah> lol
[01:55:27] <clever> lol
[01:55:35] <leah> (old sega machine)
[01:56:12] <leah> it was a z80 cpu. clock input is pin 6

[01:58:35] <leah> it's the voltage i want
[01:58:35] <clever> does that timing look good?
[01:58:38] <clever> yeah
[01:58:47] <clever> let me set the color, and then measure that, its currently solid red
[01:58:58] <leah> i'm not an expert on actual timings
[01:59:06] <leah> but iirc the voltages should always be constant
[01:59:11] <leah> (amplitude)
[01:59:27] <leah> constant, if always the same colour
[02:00:04] <leah> peak to peak voltage is what i was asking for. rising edge

Most CRT's will released the stored charge in a few minutes (if you have one without bleeder resistors and you grab a few resistors, enjoy death mind you), aside from the charge in the tube. Usually the charge in the tube is only enough to give you a good shock - and so you need to know how to safely discharge the tube.
