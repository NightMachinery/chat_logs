[12:02:11] <Khepra> cadmio: sounds like a problem with the file manager. mtp is not "real" filesystem access, it's "remote", not unlike FTP, which means the file manager would have to deal with download into a temp location, and opening for preview or edit
[12:03:44] <cadmio> Khepra: ok so the preview is nothing different from copying it and opening
[12:04:37] <PMT> In particular, I don't think MTP has a notion of seeking, just "give me that whole file", so it can't go look at a thumbnail in a file and display it.
[12:05:00] <Khepra> if the file manager can't use the open or openat syscalls (and I think it can't for mtp, because it's not a locally presentable filesystem), then it'd have to copy (download) first, yes
[12:05:34] <Khepra> afaik, it ain't even FUSE... right? I'm assuming this is GNOME and mtp:// scheme is done via gvfs?
[12:05:56] <PMT> I believe there may be a FUSE MTP driver, but yes, I don't think that's what's in use here.
[12:05:57] <Khepra> and as all gnome things go..... GoodLuckWithThat(tm)  :)
[12:06:20] <PMT> I haven't had occasion to think much about MTP in quite some time.
[12:06:24] <Khepra> PMT: yeah, I've been using jmtpfs from command line
[12:06:45] <Khepra> but there's no mtp:// scheme handling for that one -- hence my assumption that this is gnome+gvfs

[21:10:31] <aprodigy> anyone got any idea if lxd will ever get packaged for debian? last post that is tracked is from january...
[21:10:53] <PMT> I believe there's a long queue of things to do for that to work.
[21:10:58] <jantje> Hi! I'm trying to get a minial debian environment for an embedded system - I'd like to use busybox instead of coreutils - anyone knows how I can do that with debootstrap/multistrap - or point me to any documentation that might get me going?
[21:11:52] <aprodigy> PMT: alright... thank you, but it is some work in progress?
[21:13:36] <PMT> I would kind of have expected to see an update on the bug/wiki if it wasn't. You could go look for the person named on the wiki on the OFTC channels, since they don't seem to be here.
[21:14:06] <aprodigy> thank you, will do so
[21:14:12] <PMT> https://gobby.debian.org/export/Teams/Go/ says the doc was last updated 2021/8/3 despite the 2021-01 note.
[21:15:09] <aprodigy> i just knew of this one here, https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=768073
[21:15:10] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/768073 in wnpp (open): «ITP: lxd -- The Linux Container Daemon»; severity: wishlist; opened: 2014-11-04; last modified: 2021-01-19.
[21:17:43] <aprodigy> maaaaany deps not in Debian (maybe vendoring the client part is an option ?):
[21:17:49] <aprodigy> kinda sad
[21:17:56] <aprodigy> but keeping my fingers crossed
[21:18:00] <PMT> I think the bug very explicitly says "no we're not vendoring the kitchen sink for this"

[22:57:10] <JamesFerret> By the way people, I'm very new to debian. Is there something I should know with regards to its difference with ubuntu?
[22:57:40] <JamesFerret> Apart from some snaps, ppa and obviously the free version issues
[22:57:56] <sussudio> i don't use ubuntu, so i have no reference point for that.
[22:58:03] <PMT> "It's not Ubuntu" is factually correct and mostly unhelpful. More precisely, don't necessarily assume package names are always the same or that you could install packages for Ubuntu on Debian.

[22:58:58] <JamesFerret> I see, so apt doesn't go both ways
[22:59:11] <PMT> It doesn't go either way.
[23:00:15] <JamesFerret> Does ubuntu significantly change apt packages that already exist in debian?
[23:00:25] <JamesFerret> I assumed they simply builded upon it

[23:00:46] <JamesFerret> * built it
[23:01:11] <PMT> Varies by package. In general, they use things from Debian testing as a base, but there are a nontrivial number of differences.
