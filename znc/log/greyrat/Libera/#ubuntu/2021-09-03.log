[01:28:48] <tomreyn> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/219142/mounting-a-btrfs-image-file#answers should work against the reassembled, uncompressed, btrfs image - i assume.

[01:43:53] <tomreyn> cloudcell: this is an error you should solve, probably by removing ths apt repository. but it is probably not the cause for the problem with the cuda package. according to https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/3BnAecuk/ there is a "cuda-11-4" package available in version "11.4.1-1" - which I think does match the "version 11.4.1 or greater" requirement. so there can be another problem preventing installation of this package.

[01:44:15] <Starmina> Hello everyone, i have a tons of "kernel: audit:" logs in syslog. I tried to tweak /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf to remove those to no avail. It drives me crazy. Some search on Google talk about some files in /etc/audit/... to tweak but I have no such files. And I don't even have a /var/log/audit file ! The default 50-default.conf shows nothing about audit. I don't even have any package related to audit appart from "libaudit". I randomly tried to add
[01:44:16] <Starmina> "audit.none -/var/log/syslog" but of course, this doesn't work. Removing the first line in 50-default.conf (with *.* -/var/log/syslog) indeed stop "kernel audit" messages from showing up as well as any other logs, which is not the behaviour i'm looking for. My last hope is to ask here, i feel sorry :| usually Google work for me.

[01:46:48] <Croran> starmina: and i've tried researching ways to filter them out too. actually i seem to recall once i actually modified and recompiled a kernel driver in freebsd just to get rid of its debug messages.
[01:47:17] <tomreyn> Starmina: those "audit" records are often related to apparmor 'violations'. and those are often triggered by badly crafted snaps.

[01:47:56] <Croran> Starmina: if you find a good way to filter them i'd like to know too.
[01:48:19] <Max-P> you can disable those by booting with `audit=0`
[01:48:43] <tomreyn> is this the right approach, though?
[01:48:53] <Croran> Max-P: adding a kernel command line in grub?
[01:49:19] <tomreyn> better identify the software triggering them and find a fix for it, or an alternative

[01:49:44] <Croran> personally i'd like to filter them down to a single line for repeats. the way the USB error messages get 'compressed'.

[06:15:38] <leftyfb> supastupid: just focus on the vim part of the tutorial. Unless you're going to be running UNIX anytime soon, you won't be coming across the original vi editor
