[00:40:53] <elshize> The-Compiler: I've used astroid before, I actually liked it a lot, but I decided to switch to neomutt because I don't want to lean so heavily on notmuch; simply because it's so difficult to make it sync across devices. so I use maildir/neomutt and only use notmuch for search, which is working out for me so far

[00:45:07] <ThinkT510> anyone seen this before?: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole
[00:53:53] <The-Compiler> elshize: the only other device I use mail with is my phone (K-9 mail), and mostly only for casual reading, don't really need tags there. I imagine with alot it should work fine, no?
[00:54:05] <The-Compiler> ThinkT510: heard a lot about it but never used it myself
[01:07:36] <elshize> The-Compiler: yeah, basically notmuch works perfectly fine if you're getting mail and only work on tags, and also you don't care about syncing whatever you're doing locally to your imap.
[01:08:39] <elshize> I found that once I tried moving messages around locally I had some problems with syncing, notmuch wouldn't necessarily pick up all those changes, and it's just a more complex setup with more things to worry about
[01:09:53] <elshize> and I realized that I only used notmuch for actual content search, and not tags, so that's how I'm using it now.
[01:10:33] <elshize> anyway, chances are that I'll come back to alot at some point, I can never stick to one client for long :D though I really like my current neomutt setup
[01:11:13] <elshize> another good thing about notmuch is that you can try multiple clients, alot or astroid or any other + cmdline itself, which is cool
[01:11:32] <elshize> and the clients based on notmuch search are just so much simpler

[08:54:35] <ectospasm> So, one thing I miss from Vivaldi is the bookmarks toolbar.  In Vivaldi I have separate bookmark folders with related bookmarks in them, and it made it really easy to go to known bookmarks
[08:55:08] <ectospasm> I had to dump these to a plain HTML file, and when I imported them with importer.py it lost a lot of that organization.
[08:56:06] <ectospasm> One thing I noticed, quickmarks and bookmarks aren't set up the same way, and the output of importer.py is in the quickmarks format (label first, then URL).  Bookmarks if I'm not mistaken are the other way around (URL first, then label).
[08:56:35] <ectospasm> I had to use some sed magic to put them how qutebrowser expects them for bookmarks.
[08:57:06] <ectospasm> And now my bookmarks are completely disorganized, they don't seem to be in any logical order
[08:57:16] <ectospasm> Which makes finding the bookmark I want difficult.
[08:57:52] <ectospasm> Most times I don't use bookmarks, I just use browser history.
[08:58:12] <ectospasm> But for pages I want to be able to get back to directly, bookmarks are ideal.
[08:59:21] <ectospasm> One in particular is the Docker Hub page for the official Ghost images.  I get a notice from GitHub that a new version of Ghost has been released, and the first thing I check for is to see whether Docker Hub shows it.
[09:01:14] <ectospasm> Sometimes Docker Hub can lag GitHub by a couple of days, so I have another bookmark to the Docker images GitHub, where I can usually see that there is an Issue for the Ghost image that is waiting to be processed by Docker Hub.
[09:01:42] <ectospasm> Now, finding those bookmarks is difficult, because there's no logical organization to my bookmarks file that I can see.
[09:06:53] <ectospasm> So, I started looking into QtToolBar widgets, and reading the urlmarks.py in the qutebrowser source.
[09:07:25] <ectospasm> It looks like the data structures for quickmarks and bookmarks are quite simple, too simple to be able to organize in the way I want.
[09:08:53] <ectospasm> My thought is to use a JSON structure on disk, that can be loaded into a Python dict (or OrderedDict, as it were), and then be made available via the QtToolBar.
[09:09:34] <ectospasm> The Vivaldi bookmarks file is exactly that, though I don't think Vivaldi uses Qt (it might, but I'm not aware of anything).

[09:24:00] <jasonwryan> ectospasm: by “looking for bookmarks”, eg., dockerhub, does that mean typing docker and then selecting the URL you want?
[09:24:27] <jasonwryan> because I find that eminently more usable that most other bookmark systems in browsers
[09:24:40] <jasonwryan> YMMV of course ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:25:16] <ectospasm> You mean with `open [-t] ...`?  Or is there a way to filter when looking at qute://bookmarks?
[09:25:47] <jasonwryan> I don't look at bookmarks, I use tab-completion - it's much quicker
[09:26:40] <ectospasm> Hmmm, but that would require me remembering the exact URL for some pages.
[09:26:47] <jasonwryan> so, for dockerhub, t docker<TAB><Enter> etc
[09:26:59] *** Joins: vanvik (~vanvik@78.156.12.223)
[09:27:14] <jasonwryan> you can use the title, or in quickmarks save a shortcut name
[09:28:03] <jasonwryan> I have zero entries in bookmarks, they're all quickmarks it turns out :p
[09:28:37] <ectospasm> Ahh, I see!  I never noticed, but it brings up matching bookmarks that I can tab through.
[09:28:57] <jasonwryan> :D
[09:28:59] <ectospasm> So, my QtToolBar idea would be overkill
[09:29:11] <jasonwryan> somewhat… :)
[09:29:43] <ectospasm> Well, it would mimic the functionality I see in Vivaldi and Chrome, to name a couple of browsers that show that.
[09:30:19] <ectospasm> But this is better, I don't need to figure out how to do that necessarily.
[09:30:37] <ectospasm> Because to be honest, the toolbar idea seems kind of anti-qutebrowser.
[09:31:44] <ectospasm> I do think I want to set url.auto_search back to naive.
[09:32:33] <ectospasm> One thing I haven't figured out, if I'm intending to use a search engine, when I enter a non-URL string, it takes me to the main search engine page, I have to click submit to see the results.  
[09:32:44] <ectospasm> Is there any way to just show the results page automatically?
[09:33:26] <jasonwryan> I don't follow: what are you entering in the bar?
[09:34:04] <jasonwryan> if I enter: t qute I get https://duckduckgo.com/?q=qute&ia=web
[09:35:40] <ectospasm> I'm using Google (I drank the Google Kool-Aid a long time ago), so when I search for say "qutebrowser FAQ", it brings me to the Google main search page, with "qutebrowser FAQ" in the search/input field.  I have to click "Google Search" to get the results page.
[09:35:58] <ectospasm> Or, "I'm Feeling Lucky"
[09:36:05] <jasonwryan> whats the entry in your config?
[09:36:41] <ectospasm> url.searchengines = {"DEFAULT": "https://google.com/?q={semiquoted}"}

[13:14:31] <The-Compiler> jtgd, toofar: I'm not even sure if I'd expect that to work. There's probably just no way to insert most unicode characters via a keypress.
[13:14:51] <The-Compiler> toofar: do you add the crash to the Qt 6 issue or should I?
[13:16:46] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: you could have used --bookmark-output instead of sed magic ;)
[13:17:10] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: however, consider using quickmarks and an appropriate naming convention to organize stuff
[13:17:51] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: there are also a lot of ideas floating around in https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/3855 (including using JSON to store marks). I should pick that up again some day...
[13:18:53] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: I think there is a lot of room for interesting approaches to bookmark management without a toolbar full of menus. I guess e.g. a tagging system might be interesting.
[13:20:16] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: I ran a bot here for a while (I think originally to combat spam before Freenode did), and I did indeed implement !next in it (but nothing else from phrik)
[13:26:09] <toofar> I did not add the fake-key emdash (enum) crash to the qt6 issue. Noted it down for following up maybe on the weekend
[13:26:31] <toofar> if you feel like reproducing it go ahead :)
[13:27:25] <The-Compiler> toofar: ah, same root cause as another issue I've seen
[13:27:42] <The-Compiler> toofar: the "pasting an emoji" one on https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5395#issuecomment-1006648212
[13:28:31] <The-Compiler> actually, pasting is the wrong word there
[13:30:15] <The-Compiler> toofar: I wonder if we need to talk to PyQt to allow arbitrary values to be converted into a Qt.Key or if we should try to fix this in our code so that it does not use Qt.Key at all
[13:33:10] <toofar> I don't really have that stuff in my head atm but I'm sure Phil will have an opinion. I guess matching the C++ API is would be the main driver
[13:34:02] <The-Compiler> toofar: well, that's the thing, C++ uses int rather than Qt.Key in places like QKeyEvent... yay type safety?
[13:34:15] <The-Compiler> so might well be something we need to adjust on our side
[13:34:53] <The-Compiler> I get a feeling that key handling stuff will probably need the most work (especially if we want to retain Qt 5 compat)
[13:35:19] <toofar> I'm not sure we have any other option at the moment in some cases beyond or-ing stuff to essentially cast it to a different type (not sure if that is that case here)
[13:36:34] <The-Compiler> In theory, Qt 6 introduced QKeyCombination to avoind ORing keys and modifiers into a single value... in practice that probably is a somewhat leaky abstraction, but I guess we'll see
[13:37:48] <jtgd> config.bind('\\-', 'insert-text —', mode='insert')   Works most of the time. Sometimes I get a weird error. Thanks for the tip.
[13:38:48] <The-Compiler> kinda glad that we have KeyInfo already: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/v2.4.0/qutebrowser/keyinput/keyutils.py#L341 - that will probably help because we don't really use Qt's key stuff directly in many places. Was a big refactoring in 2017, fiete might remember, at congress :D
[13:39:00] <The-Compiler> jtgd: "a weird error"?
[13:39:27] <toofar> Ah I see, I was thinking it was a short sighted effect of the enum changes. But if you are saying it has a proper way of doing things then, yeah, might be a hard sell
[13:53:25] <The-Compiler> I don't consider the C++ API proper, but "it's closer to the C++ API" is a good argument unfortunately

[16:17:38] <marcello42> hey folks.. Anyone had luck with blocking YT from autoplaying videos upon opening the html?

[16:37:46] <famus> marcello42: the content.autoplay flag should work via :set anc config.py - though it needs a restart to work (This message has been postponed on 2021-11-17 07:44:23.)
[16:37:55] <famus> ^^^ that's what he said
[16:38:17] <The-Compiler> famus: that reply was from 2 months ago though
[16:38:51] <marcello42> hey famus thanks yes I see it in my buffer his reponse :)
[16:39:25] <famus> I feel like I'm in a confusing time-travel movie
[16:40:06] <marcello42> The-Compiler: I set that already as I found in the pretty good documentation but apparently youtube triggers autoplay somehow differently.. I found posts regarding this, saying it might be triggered by JS so I was thinking perhaps to prevent media/videos in general would solve this issue
[16:41:31] <marcello42> famus: yes same.. lol just saw this was asked like month ago :D sorry for inconvience 
[16:41:46] <marcello42> apparently this bothers me already for a bit.. @compiler sorry for answering like years later
[16:42:12] <ionen> since I have no intention to let it play or needlessly buffer given going to use mpv or invidious, I just block googlevideo.com entirely
[16:42:26] <marcello42> ionen: nice!
[16:42:47] <marcello42> this might be a qnd solution to my problem ;)
[16:43:10] <famus> The-Compiler, thanks for the answer re: tracking etc. I'm gonna get a more permanent way to sit in an IRC channel.. my laptop keeps suspending and making a mess of it. 
[16:43:31] <The-Compiler> famus: I just postpone messages if people are gone, have weechat running on a server
[16:43:38] <marcello42> now I just need to find a thread where I can find a good solution to use my yt cookie for mpv hehe ..man pages were saying it needs to be in netscape format.. is there an option to export
[16:43:59] <marcello42> The-Compiler: now I understand why I do actually see it.. nice!
[16:44:13] <marcello42> I forgot to put qutebrowser in autojoin
[16:44:17] <The-Compiler> via https://weechat.org/scripts/source/postpone.py.html/ for the curious
[16:44:30] <marcello42> thanks!
[16:44:37] <marcello42> btw gj on this awesome browser
[16:45:11] <marcello42> makes my life much more distraction free hehe I hope I am able to contribute at some point
[16:46:37] <The-Compiler> :)
[16:49:50] <marcello42> I have lots of qt-flags which I am passing through.. I did not find anything about whether or not it is possible to include them in the config. perhaps it isn't qutebrowser related and moreso in to qt-webengine?
[16:50:07] <The-Compiler> marcello42: out of curiousity, which flags?
[16:50:15] <The-Compiler> marcello42: there's the qt.args setting though
[16:52:03] <marcello42> I made a script to open qtbrowser this is all in there: qutebrowser $1 --qt-flag ignore-gpu-blocklist --qt-flag enable-gpu-rasterization --qt-flag enable-native-gpu-memory-buffers --qt-flag num-raster-threads=4 --qt-flag enable-accelerated-video-decode --qt-flag autoplay-policy=user-gesture-required
[16:53:04] <marcello42> my workaround was to create a .desktop for xdg and use the script instead hehe
[16:53:23] <The-Compiler> marcello42: the last should be equivalent to qutebrowser's autoplay setting anyways. The others you can set via the qt.args setting, but it's disputed whether they actually do something useful

[16:53:58] <marcello42> rendering is more responsive now but to be honest I am running a pretty low end machine
[16:54:07] <The-Compiler> marcello42: also note that you should always use "$@" (including quotes) in wrapper scripts, right now you break passing multiple arguments and also break arguments with spaces
[16:54:59] <marcello42> thanks for feedback! yes this makes sense took me quite some time why it did not work at all until I realized all args are dropped lol
[16:55:19] <guido> marcello42: you can use https://gist.github.com/guidocella/a272b6e68f9c44532b011f6596e95c61 to convert qutebrowser's cookie to Netscape format
[16:55:39] <marcello42> guido: thanks!
[17:01:37] <marcello42> The-Compiler: is the qt.args file qutebrowser related? regarding to the arch manpages there is no path mentioned
[17:02:53] <ktprograms> marcello42: I'm guessing qt.args is a python variable that goes in config.py
[17:04:06] <ktprograms> Oops no, it's a setting set inside qutebrowser
[17:04:38] <ktprograms> doc/help/settings.asciidoc:288 on master it seems
[17:05:15] <marcello42> aaaaah yes
[17:05:30] <marcello42> great thanks

[17:07:45] <marcello42> now it is easy to edit the yaml ;)
[17:08:44] <The-Compiler> marcello42: you mean the yaml file which starts with a comment stating that you shouldn't edit it by hand?
[17:08:58] <marcello42> busted
[17:09:07] <marcello42> :D
[17:09:33] <The-Compiler> marcello42: you might want to give https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc a read
[17:10:05] <The-Compiler> marcello42: i.e. use a config.py if you want to edit things manually, or use :sed
[17:10:07] <The-Compiler> :set even
[17:11:13] <marcello42> usually I do but for this it is easy to copy paste my script values
[17:11:19] <marcello42> but I take your advice
[17:27:49] <ktprograms> marcello42: FYI you _can_ paste when entering a qutebrowser command, so you could have done `:set qt.args ` and then press the paste shortcut.
[17:28:35] <marcello42> ktprograms: ;) true! I eventually did this
[17:32:35] <ktprograms> ok great!

[18:16:34] <bascht> Hi all! I've got a question re the spawn command. It seems that the spawned commands get quoted if they contain non-alphanumeric characters. 
[18:17:21] <bascht> So e.g. "spawn ls /home/bascht" will run it as-is, but "spawn ls ~/" will quote the ~/ part with single quotes, resulting in an error 
[18:17:35] <bascht> Is there some way to just pass every argument unquoted to spawn?

[18:19:47] <nimaje> ~ is expanded by a shell normally, :spawn executes the command directly so nothing does that expansion

[18:22:44] <bascht> Yip, but the shell isn't even involved at this point. I'm not even worried about the expansion, but the quoting.
[18:23:02] <bascht> E.g. "spawn --verbose echo HOME" will be unquoted: https://drop.bascht.space/1d37c546cb8ae618a195a4a6.png
[18:23:24] <bascht> E.g. "spawn --verbose echo $HOME" will be quoted: https://drop.bascht.space/5ae4a299089b1b30f8c46d5f.png

[18:26:48] <nimaje> that seems to be just some strange rendering of Command in the process info, if echo really got $HOME quoted as '$HOME' it would really print '$HOME' as there is no shell involved
[18:28:06] <bascht> nimaje: I don't think it's just that either.

[18:28:42] <The-Compiler> it is, the process info shows the command so that it could be run in a shell, but there is no shell actually involved
[18:28:48] <bascht> vs. https://drop.bascht.space/1a8687b0f254b0859b6ce0f6.png
[18:29:16] <bascht> Darn. That first URL should be  https://drop.bascht.space/5bf9f8d28de1cca60c933324.png
[18:29:28] <nimaje> do you have some directory called $HOME ?
[18:29:29] *** Joins: gast0n (~g4570n@user/gast0n)
[18:30:06] <bascht> Basically: "spawn --verbose file /home/bascht" works, "spawn --verbose file $HOME" doesn't, since the quotes get passed to the command. 
[18:30:14] <The-Compiler> bascht: no, it's not about quotes
[18:30:29] <The-Compiler> bascht: it does not work because you are using shell syntax with something that involves no shell
[18:31:17] <bascht> I see. But shouldn't all arguments to the command be quoted then?
[18:31:18] *** Joins: barbarossa93 (~barbaross@c-73-39-107-44.hsd1.md.comcast.net)
[18:31:32] <The-Compiler> bascht: quoting is shell syntax as well
[18:32:18] <The-Compiler> bascht: the process output shows the command being run in shell-like syntax (because that's an useful human-readable format), but in reality, no shell is involved, so no quoting is needed
[18:33:25] <ninewise> (note to self: maybe when continuing on the command line parser, make it not seem shell too much)
[18:34:22] <The-Compiler> bascht: it's like running   subprocess.run(["some_command", "arg with spaces", "$HOME"])  from Python (or many other languages) - you don't need to quote arguments because you pass a list of them in the first place, and shell constructs won't work, as there is no shell
[18:34:52] <The-Compiler> ninewise: to be fair, shells are a major inspiration with the --flags to commands already
[18:35:26] <ninewise> yup
[18:35:47] <The-Compiler> I still wonder if qutebrowser was the first project to do that, I *think* it is
[18:36:04] <nimaje> probably would be a good idea to add a way to use env variables in :spawn arguments, maybe {env[ENV_VAR]}
[18:36:10] <ninewise> though that's not shell at all, that's just a coincidence a lot of CLI programs accept those
[18:36:19] <The-Compiler> ninewise: fair
[18:36:38] <ninewise> nimaje, also noted
[18:37:27] <The-Compiler> that would then probably be a replacement for inside qutebrowser commands in general
[18:39:05] <The-Compiler> ninewise: FWIW I'm somewhat tempted (no pun intended) to have some kind of syntax in the commandline syntax which is handled by a templating engine like jinja :D
[18:39:17] <bascht> :D
[18:40:20] <The-Compiler> ninewise: like, you could do  {{ env("ENV_VAR") }}  but also  {{ url.host }}  or whatever
[18:40:25] <The-Compiler> but I guess that's for another day

[20:27:03] <wildefyr> oh right yeah that will do what I want
[20:30:59] <kuhilas> hey I'm trying to find a way to launch mpv for a youtube video I have a youtube page open (from invidious instance) There is a link on the page "watch on youtube" for example. I don't have a keyboard to do this, and I want to launch it with my gamepad. My gamepad has bound the following keyboard keys to its buttons: arrow keys up/down/left/right, left alt, TAB, mouse buttons left/middle/right, left shift, return, super key(win key) and  left
[20:30:59] <kuhilas> control. So you see there is not really any common keys bound. I was thinking that I add in qutebrowsers config a hint thing to launch the url in mpv, but can I bound this to some combo using those keys only
[20:31:12] <The-Compiler> wildefyr: there is :config-cycle fwiw
[20:31:47] <The-Compiler> kuhilas: I don't see why not, but not sure if you could *select* the hint with that

[20:32:54] <kuhilas> I guess the right click menu is not configurable in qutebrowser yet
[20:34:06] <kuhilas> and won't be I guess since it was not really easy to do and this is keyboard-driven browser anyway
[20:35:16] <The-Compiler> there is an issue for that, but yeah, it's not exactly at the top of my priorities
[20:36:58] <kuhilas> hmm I guess I'll do a yank the URL to primary shortcut and use one detour. What would you suggest given those keys? I'm really clueless. Like can I or should I do some combo where I press those keys in succession
[20:37:47] <kuhilas> can I bind something like 4 consecutive left alt clickng yanks to primary?
[20:38:03] <The-Compiler> not sure about alt, since it normally is a modifier
[20:40:18] <kuhilas> scanning through the config.py if it has an example for binding of consecutive clicks instead of combo with +
[20:41:03] <marcello42> guido: btw the script did not work :/ but I wrote my own I took the idea of using sqlite from him
[20:41:17] <The-Compiler> like with "gg" you should be able to bind "<Return><Return>" or whatever, kuhilas 
[20:41:25] <guido> I use it daily and it works though?
[20:41:27] <The-Compiler> not sure if <Alt> will work as a key though
[20:43:20] <marcello42> guido: there was the netscape line missing what was kinda trivial.. but the bigger problem was that some addresses did not start with an '.' so it was not valid netscape format and yt dl refused to read the file
[20:43:51] <guido> hm, I think youtube-dl is more picky
[20:43:58] <guido> it works with curl/aria2c/gallery-dl

[20:58:43] <guido> marcello42: gist is to share files that are too small for a repository
[20:59:47] <marcello42> I see
[21:00:12] <nimaje> guido: you should at least namespace the file in /tmp, so that it doesn't conflict with something else trying to use /tmp/Cookies and supporting TMPDIR and passing a datadir seem like good ideas too
[21:00:13] <marcello42> seems like the only way of publishing is to copy/paste the code as I cannot find a upload file function
[21:01:00] <guido> never heard of TMPDIR
[21:01:56] <guido> by datadir you mean honoring XDG_DATA_HOME?
[21:02:53] <nimaje> no, I meant passing a datadir via $1 in case you want to use it on another basedir
[21:03:01] <marcello42> $TMPDIR isn't set for me
[21:03:11] <guido> neither for me
[21:03:24] <marcello42> but /tmp is always present in unix-like systems
[21:04:28] <marcello42> the only thing which might be arguable is whether or not /tmp is appropirate for cookies as they contain very sensible data, but in the end it is up to the user to encrypt /tmp
[21:05:54] <guido> yeah but qutebrowser doesn't encrypt the cookies it stores anyway
[21:06:11] <guido> in fact that's what makes it so easy to export the cookies. I couldn't do this easily in chromium
[21:06:21] <marcello42> yup, my point was onlu perhaps someone ecnrypts his home
[21:06:55] <marcello42> but fde might be best practice anyway :)
[21:06:56] <guido> I use arch where /tmp is mounted as tmpfs, so they aren't persisted
[21:07:24] <guido> I know at least on debian /tmp is not a tmpfs though
[21:07:26] <marcello42> true I have my /tmp still ecnrypted
[21:07:46] <nimaje> from environ(7) on my system   TMPDIR   The directory in which to store temporary files. Most applications use either /tmp or /var/tmp.  Setting this variable will make them use another directory.
[21:08:22] <marcello42> nimaje: ok odd to me, never seen this variable set
[21:08:25] <guido> actually I've been outputting cookies.txt to $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, but changed it to /tmp/cookies.txt before sharing to script so it's shorter
[21:08:54] <guido> $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR should be a tmpfs across all distro, but you have to specify the longer path /run/user/1000/cookies.txt in stuff like curlrc
[21:09:17] <marcello42> I guess you are fine with /tmp
[21:09:46] <marcello42> nearly TUI app are using it... tmux, mutt, ..
[21:09:49] <marcello42> vim also 
[21:11:00] <guido> $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR won't work on macos though 
[21:11:22] <guido> but I doubt many qutebrowser users are on macos
[21:11:32] <marcello42> true :D
[21:12:02] <marcello42> I just applied for a new job.. you can choose.. low end thinkpad or macbook .. yippiiii... not
[21:12:29] <nimaje> so I changed it a little bit https://0x0.st/o-JF.sh (note it outputs to stdout, as that way the user can write the file whereever he wants and maybe process it before)
[21:12:41] <marcello42> I'd rather see tuxedo or similar as an alternative
[21:13:35] <marcello42> guido, is there a possibility to upload files to gist?
[21:13:48] <guido> I don't think so, I just copy paste them
[21:14:16] <marcello42> ok
[21:14:26] <guido> I'm leaning towards $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cookies.txt so it's certainly a tmpfs
[21:16:25] <nimaje> I don't see a requirement for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR to be a tmpfs
[21:17:49] <guido> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory
[21:17:53] <guido> XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
[21:17:55] <guido> Can only exist for the duration of the user's login.
[21:18:01] <guido> Should not store large files as it may be mounted as a tmpfs.
[21:18:31] <guido> so even if it's not tmpfs it's automatically cleared on logout?
[21:21:05] <guido> actually if you read man file-hierarchy it does say that /run and /run/user/* are tmpfs
[21:22:05] <guido> so that should be true with systemd at least

[21:24:24] <marcello42> guido: in case you are interested ... the arch repo has a tool 'github-cli' .. gh gist --help for all commands
[21:25:10] <guido> yeah I tried that but don't really feel the need for it
[21:25:17] <guido> I guess it's more useful for maintaners
[21:25:42] <nimaje> I think I will keep that cookie extractor as https://0x0.st/o-yo.sh
[21:26:19] <marcello42> guido: thanks for all the input today, learned quite a bit :)

[23:46:02] <Bounga> Hi
[23:46:42] <Bounga> any macos user? I'd like to know if there's a working solution to use Qute + Pass under macos?
[23:50:31] <The-Compiler> Bounga: I guess the qute-pass userscript would work fine if you have Python set up?
[23:53:53] <Bounga> I do have python installed but I gt this error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tldextract'
[23:54:41] <Bounga> s/gt/get
[23:56:34] <Bounga> I guess I need to install a lib or something
[23:56:40] <The-Compiler> so install tldextract, yeah
[23:57:29] <The-Compiler> might want to create a virtualenv and use that for the script: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
[23:59:28] <Bounga> Thank you. BTW thank you for https://www.reddit.com/r/qutebrowser/comments/roi2jg/comment/hpyv9fw it helped me getting Qute running on my mac
