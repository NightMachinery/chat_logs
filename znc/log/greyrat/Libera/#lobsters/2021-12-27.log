[22:20:03] <c355E3B> The minecraft mod ecosystem is a nightmare
[22:20:58] <quindarius> I have never played minecraft but heard of people making mods for it. Why is it so bad?

[22:22:42] <c355E3B> Most of what you would expect from a "real" software project is out there

[22:23:17] <c355E3B> So I'm now having to recover this VM by snapshotting it and attaching a rescue image because something broke
[22:24:20] <technomancy> quindarius: some of it is just standard "people who play games are bad at  making software" but some of it is due to minecraft's hostility towards modding
[22:24:43] <technomancy> they'll seriously be like "download this jar file off a phpbb and run it; it's probably fine"
[22:25:15] <quindarius> That does sound pretty freaking bad. Is it only a minecraft VM or did it screw a whole bunch of your other services?
[22:26:20] <quindarius> technomancy: Was it always that way or only since Microsoft bought them out?
[22:26:40] <technomancy> when I tried it they still had it like "this mod (whose main presence on the web is a pinned phpbb thread) depends on seven other mods; you'll have to download them each manually as well as their deps too"
[22:26:59] <technomancy> quindarius: I haven't had the heart to look into it again post-acqusiition
[22:27:12] <technomancy> it's easier to *write* a mod in minetest than to install a mod in minecraft
[22:28:01] <quindarius> technomancy: Totally fair, I would be thrown off too. Just a gut feeling. And that is pretty trash haha.
[22:28:43] <technomancy> I should get back into minetest; it looks like it's come a long way since I tried it last
[22:29:22] <quindarius> I heard theres a new big update with it and my brother has been playing it pretty steadily since it.
[22:30:03] <quindarius> BTW could anyone slide a lobsters invite my way?
