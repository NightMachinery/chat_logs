[04:20:56] <Grinnz> mmm crepes
[04:21:21] <gordonfish> yum
[04:23:30] <crashmatrix> hm, that makes me wonder, can I walk the tree of use includes from a lib included by a lib included by ... up to main?
[04:23:38] *** Joins: anthk_ (~anthk_@92.176.105.30)
[04:23:56] <crashmatrix> or, I guess list at that point
[04:31:48] <Grinnz> not really
[04:32:40] <Grinnz> it would be a list of compilation units, and i dont know anything that would make that visible
[04:33:43] <crashmatrix> hm, I think I can get where I want to be using caller($i) in import() tho
[04:34:18] <Grinnz> yeah but import's caller isn't another import
[04:34:35] <Grinnz> import happens after the load
[04:35:20] <Grinnz> oh but if that's what you need then yeah, caller it up
[04:35:25] <crashmatrix> I must be missing something then, because I'm trying it, and the caller() for a nested lib points to the "parent" lib, not main
[04:35:41] <Grinnz> it points to whatever imported from it
[04:35:55] <Grinnz> but you won't be able to get from that to the next step
[04:36:12] <Grinnz> because that import didn't happen yet
[04:36:20] <crashmatrix> then the follow up, can I check the importer's other imports?
[04:36:38] <Grinnz> you might need to go back a step, what are you trying to achieve here
[04:37:30] <crashmatrix> ehm, a package called Acme::Joke, that enforces importers to import Acme::Joke as a declaration that the code won't be used aside from funsies
[04:37:43] <Grinnz> lol
[04:38:01] <crashmatrix> "how to safely shitpost on CPAN"
[04:38:21] <Grinnz> so what i'd do is
[04:38:44] <Grinnz> have it export a sub like ___AcmeJokeTag
[04:39:12] <Grinnz> and then when you try to enforce it make sure it's there
[04:39:21] <Grinnz> well, i'm not sure i follow the timeline
[04:39:52] <crashmatrix> I'll fiddle around with it some, if it turns out this works as intended I'll swing back for a sanity check
[04:39:56] <Grinnz> "enforces importers to import Acme::Joke" doesn't mean anything, importers are already importing it lol
[04:42:13] <crashmatrix> I was thinking of it as a guard that some other library made for funsies, I dunno "SemiSerious::Library", which includes Acme::Joke, can't be imported into main without 'declaring' the intention
[04:42:51] <Grinnz> ah right, so the other library's import method would have to check that Acme::Joke has been imported to its caller already
[04:43:34] <Grinnz> don't even need to export anything, you can just keep a hash of packages that have imported it
[04:44:01] <Grinnz> and then you could have some import helper for the other modules to use
[04:44:02] <crashmatrix> that's what I wanted to avoid, the inclusion of Acme::Joke should check the entire chain up to main, without hook requirements for the in-betweens
[04:44:18] <Grinnz> well it can't, and also that seems unnecessary
[04:44:25] <crashmatrix> it does?
[04:44:35] <Grinnz> all it needs to check is where it's being imported
[04:45:07] <Grinnz> unless you mean, somewhere else random in the program importing it would satisfy your case?
[04:46:42] <Grinnz> in that case you could have your import method define Acme::Joke::some_fake_sub and then the check would check soemthing defined that
[04:46:55] <Grinnz> or just set a file-scoped variable
[04:48:02] <Grinnz> basically if it matters where it's imported then you can only really check what's importing the module, if it doesn't then you don't need to do anything special with import at all
[04:49:09] <crashmatrix> i'm probably not expressing what i mean as well as i should, i'll golf this down a bit more for the moment
[05:01:10] <Adura> How would one override (?:els)if|unless to make them create globals like $_ does for for?
[05:01:52] <LeoNerd> You can't. Just assign it if you want that
[05:02:03] <LeoNerd> if(($_ = athing) { can see $_ in here }
[05:02:23] <Grinnz> localize $_ if you're going to do that
[05:02:26] <LeoNerd> Though that's a bit rude, setting globals. Nicer is to create a new variable:   if(my $thing = get_a_thing()) { can see $thing in here... }
[05:02:43] <Adura> It's just something in my mind that Perl would already do. ;p
[05:03:03] <Grinnz> there's no "it" in an arbitrary if expression
[05:03:12] <Grinnz> even while-readline depends on readline having an "it"

[05:33:36] <mst> not yet but if you're stupid enough to help me figure out the simple parts I'd be happy to help figure out the complicated parts
[05:34:29] <Adura> My skill and familiarity with Babble isn't there.
[05:35:23] <mst> Adura: if I pick it up again, we're talking about me explaining everything to you and you converting that into explanations that make sense to everybody else
[05:36:07] <mst> Adura: "skill and familiarity" wouldn't be required, only willingngess to learn and willingness to right shit up
[05:37:12] <Adura> It may be slow and silly an idea, but I'll do my best to bounce and absorb ideas.
[05:38:56] <mst> babble works but it as currently existing sucks massively in terms of explaining that it is and how it works
[05:39:43] <mst> I'm tied right now but if we can figure out how to work together on it that'd rock
[05:40:29] <Adura> My "coding for myself" mindset may prevent you from gleaning much useful code from me, hah.
[05:41:26] <Adura> But, if I did come up with my idea, guess it'd make for a great example usage.
[05:41:44] <mst> Adura: the offer here is that I do my best to explain stuff and you turn it into explanations that are useful to you, and can be copy pasted into the docs
[05:42:24] <Adura> Sure, if you can help me make the idea work you can use a prettified version of my code for examples in the docs.
[05:43:19] <mst> right, plus, you turn at least some of my waffling into paragraphs in the process
[05:43:46] <Adura> I'm in no hurry to do this, so, poke me whenever.
