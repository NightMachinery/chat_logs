[02:20:28] <manicennui> Why must anime have so much yelling though?
[02:20:39] <Brekkjern> I was about to comment on that :P
[02:20:54] <Brekkjern> Demon Slayer was fun, but I had to watch it at lower volume
[02:23:03] <dimadima> everything has so much yelling
[02:23:16] <dimadima> i stopped watched south park cause at some point it became 22 minutes of yelling
[02:23:26] <dimadima> too intense for me
[02:25:12] <manicennui> Anime seems so much more creative and thoughtful than Western animation
[02:25:54] <manicennui> The little details in the fights in Demon Slayer are amazing
[02:25:56] <Brekkjern> It can be
[02:26:06] <Brekkjern> But there is a fuckton of absolute crap too I imagine
[02:26:38] <manicennui> The breathing, the thinking through how to win
[02:26:53] <manicennui> Sure, we probably get the best stuffed
[02:26:59] <manicennui> Stuff
[02:28:05] <manicennui> Really like how each demon slayer has some different strength like smell or hearing
[02:28:47] <cb> been watching the NGE rebuilds
[02:28:54] <cb> 1 was a bit fucked up pacing wise
[02:28:59] <cb> 2 worked really wekk

[02:33:59] <indigo> Lmao, that is great
[02:37:53] <Church> cb: 1&2 were my fave
[02:38:00] <Church> 3 they fucked up on the cutting room
[02:38:18] <Church> 4 due to cutting room stuff for 3 made sense thematically but plot wise....
[02:40:20] <Brekkjern> You know when you read something and you just immediately go "I gotta get me some of this!"
[02:40:32] <Brekkjern> And your next thought is "That would probably be a bad idea..."
[02:41:03] <Brekkjern> >Oh yeah, ClF3 is what you get when somebody thinks pure oxygen is a baby oxidiser for babies.
[02:41:03] <Brekkjern> >So it obviously burns anything organic, and explodes in contact with water which is pretty standard sodium stuff.
[02:41:03] <Brekkjern> >But then it also burns things which aren't normally thought of as burn-able like ashes, sand (making it rather hard to extinguish the fire), concrete, glass, asbestos, … and it's hypergolic, so it starts a fire on contact, no need for a separate ignition source, just put ClF3 on sand and voilà, ClF3/sand fire (just avoid wet sand).
[02:41:03] <Brekkjern> >And when it burns it releases vaporised acid, because it's shy and doesn't like spectators I guess.

[07:37:48] <quanticle> prussian: re: https://clbin.com/Bkio3 that's pretty cool
[07:37:50] <quanticle> However, I would still argue that the Powershell pipeline is *far* easier to understand, for the same reason that struct/object property accesses are easier to understand than magic array offsets. And that kind of gets back to my point about text being a really really terrible serialization protocol. You can do all the same sorting things, but in order to do so, you're basically serializing
[07:37:52] <quanticle> your data as a textual array of arrays and then you're stuck with remembering what offset does what. That's fine for a one-off but it's kind of a maintainability nightmare.
[07:40:51] <manicennui> quanticle: https://www.nushell.sh/book/

[07:46:48] <quanticle> Yeah, if I ever go back to Linux as my desktop OS, the first thing I'm going to do is install something like nushell or oil

[07:47:49] <quanticle> Where he measures the growth of command line options and notes that the vast majority of them are formatting switches that allow you to structure your text stream for consumption by another shell program.
[07:47:53] <cb> the problem w/ nushell et al is there's no real tools that take advantage of it
[07:48:12] <cb> on windows, PowerShell aggregates API-based config, WMI, there's a cmdlet ecosystem
[07:48:15] <quanticle> Yeah
[07:48:20] <cb> on unix, fuck you, everything is text, even /etc
[07:48:39] <quanticle> Forget /etc, /proc is text too
[07:48:39] <cb> the only really way i think you can do it is write cmdlets based on like systemd APIs
[07:48:51] <cb> since they allow for dbus based structured info and setting of things
[07:48:52] <manicennui> Actually everything is just a stream of bytes
[07:49:24] <cb> this is why the unix post on front page pissed me off
[07:49:25] <quanticle> Great quote from the aforementioned link: "People sometimes say that they don't want to support structured data because they'd have to support multiple formats to make a universal tool, but they already have to support multiple formats to make a universal tool. Some standard commands can't read output from other commands because they use different formats, wc -w doesn't handle Unicode
[07:49:27] <quanticle> correctly, etc. Saying that "text" is a universal format is like saying that "binary" is a universal format."

[19:07:21] <prussian> at my work, this guy got his truck stuck in snow mound and basically burned rubber
[19:07:39] <prussian> all the fellow workers were watching from an office as this guy struggled to leave. was really funny.
[19:07:59] <prussian> good times...
[19:08:38] <Brekkjern> I worked on a delivery truck back in the days. It was amazing seeing what kind of control the drivers had over the truck
[19:08:45] <Brekkjern> It amuses me that some don't :P
[19:08:59] <prussian> nice.
[19:09:26] <prussian> I laugh how they have whole communications company to basically monitor them.
[19:10:06] <prussian> the real terror are always the train derailment or crashes were you get the report that the driver was going too fast or ended up falling asleep.
[19:11:46] <Brekkjern> I remember once we delivered to a school, and the driver managed to park the truck with the roof over the stairs of the entrance inside the truck
[19:11:55] <prussian> lol
[19:12:01] <goodger> prussian: as shown in the linked article, it was a full-size heavy goods vehicle
[19:12:08] <Brekkjern> That way he could get the floor in the truck to be level with the entrance :P
[19:12:15] <Brekkjern> It looked absurd, but it worked out well

[19:13:12] <prussian> startup...
[19:13:28] <prussian> make a sensor that can detect if an oncoming vehicle is too high for a bridge.
[19:13:35] <prussian> the future is now...
[19:13:45] <Brekkjern> I've also seen someone reverse a truck with a trailer to a loading dock, where they only had about 20cm clearance on either side
[19:13:53] <prussian> damn

[19:14:33] <goodger> cf ‘if you hit this sign, you will hit that bridge’

[19:16:36] <prussian> idk. if people bloww through them though, I imagine more visual ques would be better.

[20:17:47] <prussian> Xe: I created the curse. someone mentioned vagrant and I was like, but dockerfile is like, ez bro...
[20:17:58] <prussian> and then all the windows users started getting all mad
[20:18:11] <Geekingfrog> :D
[20:18:12] <prussian> and then I pushed half of them onto some autoinstalling ubuntu vm
[20:18:20] <Geekingfrog> now you're going to get all the hate
[20:18:23] <prussian> you know what? just shoot me now
[20:18:28] <prussian> let's go with that.
[20:18:47] <Geekingfrog> which environment do you work in?
[20:18:52] <prussian> at least I got my "President Award: 2019" for this crap
[20:19:17] <prussian> Geekingfrog: stupid industrial "wannabe IoT" device.
[20:19:58] <prussian> when I signed up to work here, all the devs did everything in visual studio 2009 on windows and tested everything on windows with simulators usinx Excel spreadsheets as DSLs.
[20:20:25] <prussian> and the build system for the product basically was some 100k LoC shell script that pushed Visual Studio solution files through a bunch of steps to generate makefiles.
[20:20:50] <pja> prussian: some people insist on making life hard for themslves.
[20:21:04] <prussian> anyhow. neither here nor there. I hate what I made, but I hate what we had more.
[20:21:22] <Geekingfrog> hate driven development
[20:21:24] <prussian> also, that is how I came to know shell bs so hard.
[20:21:36] <prussian> because I had to unravel and study so much of it.
[20:22:22] <Geekingfrog> Are there alternative to docker if you want containers with a fairly easy way to declare and produce artifacts?
[20:22:29] <prussian> ANYHOW, the docker step was supposed to be a gradual hiding of the Linux developmenet I pushed on everyone. they'd do everything in CLion and it was supposed to work
[20:22:29] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
[20:22:36] <bkero> podman
[20:22:41] <prussian> Geekingfrog: that work on windows? idk...
[20:22:42] <bkero> runc
[20:22:48] <prussian> I guess that is my nightmare right now
[20:23:00] <bkero> lxd
[20:23:49] <prussian> well ya... on *my* work computer, I just use podman. I haven't gotten around to finishing a nix solution, which I figure will be the next step, but there is so much hell.
[20:24:16] <prussian> combine with the arm toolchain being some paid for supported buildroot basically.
[20:24:25] <Geekingfrog> oooh, podman seems nice
[20:26:02] <prussian> also, curses to windows
[20:26:21] <prussian> don't even try to use mingw64 by the way, just eat the EULA'd M$ compiler.
[20:26:41] <prussian> well, scratch that, if you don't care about 10 minute long link times.
[20:27:23] <Geekingfrog> What's the problem(s) with mingw64?
[20:27:29] * Geekingfrog knows nothing of these things
[20:27:53] <prussian> last I tried using it to offer an easier solution than basically a linux vm, the link times were insanely long
[20:28:25] <prussian> we have some pretty neurotic c++ stuff though. one program has about a GiB of objects to link.
[20:28:39] <prussian> well, unstripped you see.
[20:29:01] <prussian> only can strip the end result though.
[20:29:32] <prussian> again, hate windows...

[20:31:46] <Xe> i don't
[20:31:59] <ngoldbaum> “stop being rude” three comments later “rust is gay propaganda”
[20:32:17] <prussian> I always say: "implies"
[20:32:51] <ngoldbaum> in C++ it’s “points to” in rust i have no idea
[20:33:09] <companion_cube> -> is "I pray this is not nullptr"
[20:33:25] <companion_cube> (jk I don't write C++ if I can avoid it)
[20:35:20] <prussian> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional even in c++ I'd jokingly say as companion_cube said. variable implied as not null, has field x.
[20:35:20] <buttsbot> Material conditional - Wikipedia
[20:36:20] <companion_cube> probably "I pray this can't be null" cause that's what the compiler is going to assume
[20:36:23] <companion_cube> even better
[20:36:53] <prussian> but ya. even in the rust use. function implies a result of type. QED
[20:37:22] <companion_cube> there is no `->` in rust
[20:37:25] <companion_cube> it's just `foo.bar()`
[20:37:31] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: in function sigs
[20:38:13] <prussian> (a x b) -> c
[20:38:16] <prussian> is more what I meant
[20:38:23] <prussian> as in a fun sig.
[20:38:31] <prussian> a and b implies c
[20:39:09] <companion_cube> ah that
[20:39:17] <companion_cube> I'd say "returns"

[21:23:33] <ngoldbaum> ah that’s right but no bugfixes
[21:23:41] <indigo> Love me some python though... so much easier than writing shell scripts
[21:24:00] <ngoldbaum> basically upstream is trying really hard not to have another situation where they need to maintain something for a decade
[21:24:00] <indigo> Wrote a script the other day to unpack Bandcamp albums into Navidrome
[21:24:36] <indigo> ngoldbaum: One thing that I actually appreciate about Google is that everything lives at HEAD
[21:25:10] <indigo> At my last company we held off on upgrading deps until the last minute
[21:25:12] <companion_cube> indigo: I'm giving a try to typescript instead of python, for scripting :p
[21:25:21] <indigo> Oh yeah companion_cube? How is it?
[21:25:44] <ngoldbaum> to use typescript do you still also need to know javascript pretty well?
[21:25:58] <ngoldbaum> that was the state of things the last time i looked
[21:28:14] <indigo> My main worry about using typescript as a scripting language is that the JS stdlib is pretty weak
[21:28:35] <indigo> And for a scripting language I would rather have the kitchen sink
[21:28:41] <companion_cube> indigo: it's been really short time, but I like it
[21:28:45] <companion_cube> I'm using deno, I should say
[21:28:59] <companion_cube> which is nice, it comes with some basic stuff, and it's very self contained
[21:29:03] <companion_cube> and there's a LSP(!!)
[21:29:41] <companion_cube> (a good one, I mean)
[21:30:37] <companion_cube> been playing a bit with the IRC library so far
[21:33:08] <indigo> I think we have different definitions of scripting, haha
[21:34:39] <ngoldbaum> take it over to #lobsters and you can provoke technomancy into ranting about how the distinction between scripting languages and other languages is made up and you should feel bad for using it
[21:35:48] <indigo> I think he won't be too offended as long as we accept Fennel as the One True Language
[21:36:54] <companion_cube> indigo: yeah I mean, small programs and stuff
[21:37:07] <companion_cube> with toplevel statement that do stuff :p
[21:37:23] <companion_cube> (the LSP aspect is just because I have trouble not having any types)

[23:16:47] <goodger> welcome back to 1997
[23:17:05] <gerikson> becasue it requires a 25Mhz chip and those are apparently all proprietary

[23:27:45] <prussian> I mean, that's how I do it at work.
[23:28:01] <gerikson> you have specific requirements re: confidentiality and authentication
[23:28:10] <prussian> skype on "html5" never worked as claimed
