[00:13:48] <gerikson> spot the anti-libertarian https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602231/elon-musk-apple-app-store-fees-de-facto-global-tax-internet-tim-sweeney-epic-games
[00:13:48] <buttsbot> Elon Musk calls Apple’s App Store fees a ‘de facto global tax on the Internet’ - The Verge
[00:14:19] <companion_cube> oh no, I'm going to agree with Musk
[00:16:03] <gerikson> TIL the Apple appstore == the internet
[00:16:09] <kline> same
[00:16:16] <kline> i dodged the whole issue by not buying from apple
[00:16:35] <kline> so clearly its only a tax if you buy into a walled garden of premium-rate devices
[00:16:38] <kline> "oh no"
[00:16:55] <gerikson> I think I've spend a total of $10 on the app store since I got my first iphone in... 2011 ?
[00:16:56] <companion_cube> the guy lives in the US, where it's 50% of people, sadly
[00:17:28] <gerikson> and I actualy believe in paying for software
[00:17:38] <Brekkjern> I'd honestly very much like Apple to lose that lawsuit though
[00:18:52] <gerikson> yeah I guess
[00:18:53] <kline> the epic one about _having_ to use the appstore for IAP?
[00:19:07] <gerikson> i prefer letting the free market sort it out tho
[00:19:09] <kline> yes, but that has nothing to do with the idea of people choosing to buy into a premium ecosystem
[00:19:12] <companion_cube> about the inability to install apps without going through the app store…
[00:19:21] <companion_cube> gerikson: the market ? meh
[00:19:25] <companion_cube> not like a free market
[00:20:46] <kline> free market principles apply to buying rice, not high-tech
[00:21:06] <gerikson> ...
[00:21:39] <companion_cube> when you have only 2 closed ecosystems, one where you pledge alledgiance to apple, the other to google, I wouldn't say it's a free market
[00:21:54] <Brekkjern> At best it's a duopoly
[00:21:57] <companion_cube> and given the amount of network effect in place, the "just make your own alternative" argument is just bad
[00:22:11] <gerikson> ok if they're so restrictive it's fertile ground for a competitor ;)
[00:22:43] <Brekkjern> Not if the initial investment is to compete is so high that it's impossible to enter the market
[00:22:52] <companion_cube> gerikson: my exact point
[00:22:54] <gerikson> companion_cube: well , the issue is that the entire idea of "anti-trust" has been systematically argued against by at least 2 generations of conservative ideologues
[00:23:11] <companion_cube> a competitor who would have to adapt the hundreds of thousands of existing apps, to even stand a chance?
[00:23:18] <companion_cube> build millions of devices with its OS?
[00:23:29] <companion_cube> get developpers to write new apps for it too?
[00:23:50] <gerikson> we're hardly talking about basic human rights here
[00:23:58] <gerikson> it's being able to make a living selling fart apps
[00:24:29] <Brekkjern> Or to sell apps that Apple deem "Unsavory"
[00:24:52] <companion_cube> yeah, no one uses apps like uber, netflix, (some version of) maps, twitter, a web browser, …
[00:25:06] <companion_cube> I mean I'm not a big app user and still i have dozens of them installed
[00:25:20] <companion_cube> even some from the play store because it's hard work to live without them
[00:25:27] <Brekkjern> There's no shortage of apps that have been removed from the store that fulfil some educational purpose, or is made by a government entity for information or educational purposes that Apple removed.
[00:25:27] <companion_cube> (say, I use waze … yikes)
[00:25:34] <Brekkjern> Political speech is also banned in app form
[00:25:55] <companion_cube> sure, but if I have a choice between a phone that does most useful stuff minus installing Parler
[00:25:57] <gerikson> so... as a consumer I have access to those apps - the issue is that *developers*  don't make as much money as they watn
[00:25:58] <companion_cube> and one that only has Parler
[00:26:00] <companion_cube> the choice is easy
[00:26:28] <gerikson> it's not a clear cut issue
[00:26:34] <gerikson> Apple could very well prevail
[00:26:49] <gerikson> but I think that public pressure will lead to them loweing the cut
[00:26:57] <Brekkjern> Epics argument is also that it's practically impossible to install apps to an iPhone that doesn't come from the App Store for an average consumer.
[00:27:06] <gerikson> fair enough
[00:27:19] <kline> thats not a very free market
[00:27:21] <Geekingfrog> SECURITY !
[00:27:33] <companion_cube> "it's for your own good"
[00:27:45] <companion_cube> also, don't use PWA because they avoid the tax
[00:27:47] <gerikson> general purpose computing has only existed under a very short period of history
[00:27:57] <gerikson> it's arguably an abberation
[00:28:03] <Geekingfrog> why is that ?
[00:28:21] <gerikson> there's certainly no legal precedent for demanding that you can run anyting on a device you own
[00:28:28] <gerikson> it's a convention, nothing more
[00:28:42] <Geekingfrog> was there such an opportunity before though ?
[00:28:53] <gerikson> exactly
[00:28:55] <gerikson> there wasn't
[00:28:56] <companion_cube> not having it means there'll be a shortage of developers in the future, I think
[00:28:56] <Geekingfrog> And I for one would like to have that and lament this disparition
[00:29:17] <gerikson> sure and you're free to make that argument
[00:29:25] <Geekingfrog> I don't find the argument "it was just temporary, tough luck, the future is elsewhere" very convincing
[00:29:31] <companion_cube> maybe there'll be general purpose hardware from smaller sources for a long time
[00:29:45] <companion_cube> like raspis or other architectures (maybe an equivalent based on RISC-V)
[00:31:29] <gerikson> any argument *for* free access to your computing device is essentially economic - it increases the sum of products and services people are prepeared to pay for
[00:32:03] <gerikson> that's fine as far as it goes but as a legal argument you can also fight for buggy-whip manufacturer's rights to still make money
[00:32:34] <Geekingfrog> the right to make money shouldn't be higher than the right for ppl to use their devices as they wish
[00:32:44] <companion_cube> probably enough people will want general computing, that it's economically sound to sell such devices
[00:32:46] <gerikson> consumer protection? ok
[00:32:48] <Geekingfrog> and you can find a middle ground with standardisation
[00:32:55] <companion_cube> maybe it will just not be too mainstream
[00:33:01] <gerikson> agiain, a concept under concerted attack for decades
[00:33:14] <gerikson> companion_cube: yeah syre
[00:33:17] <gerikson> *sure
[00:33:24] <gerikson> there's still a market
[00:33:26] <Brekkjern> I don't disagree on that point
[00:33:29] <Geekingfrog> So because it's under attack it should simply die?
[00:33:49] <gerikson> but it's uncontested that GP computing hsa led to widespread insecurity, malware, viruses etc etc
[00:33:54] <Geekingfrog> I'm not fond of letting a few giant corporation rule my life because hey, they've been working hard at that for a long time
[00:34:13] <Geekingfrog> yeah, fair point
[00:35:00] <Brekkjern> But I'd argue that governments don't like having Apple deciding what they can tell their citizens. Being dependant on what apps the App Store allows you to install might actually limit what information you can get from the government.
[00:35:05] <Brekkjern> Or even news sources
[00:35:26] <Brekkjern> Facebook has gotten quite a few angry letters from NRK and the Norwegian culture minister for example
[00:35:38] <gerikson> I'm sure they're quaking in their boots
[00:36:04] <Geekingfrog> I'm a bit dismayed by the general opinion that "oh, it's a computer, I'm not a computer person, I can never understand". And every corp behind that trying to sell idiot proof things, and basically giving up on any improvement
[00:36:32] <Geekingfrog> that definitely doesn't help the virus & malware story
[00:36:33] <Brekkjern> gerikson: I doubt it, but it might eventually end up with the EU coming together about it.
[00:36:42] <Geekingfrog> lol the EU
[00:36:54] <Geekingfrog> I have exactly zero hope on that front
[00:37:13] <gerikson> the Apple iPhone is the most succesful computing device ever made or sold, and I'd argue a part of that is thata Apple guarantees stuff like backup, moving to a new device, preserving user settings if you lose it , etc
[00:37:54] <Geekingfrog> but does that force Apple to lock down their devices ?
[00:38:33] <Brekkjern> Guaranteeing that does not require them censoring apps because of their content.
[00:38:40] <gerikson> having full control sure helps
[00:38:51] <Brekkjern> Indeed
[00:39:15] <Geekingfrog> and it sure guarantee some form of recurring revenue
[00:39:24] <Brekkjern> But you might see legislation that prevents them from removing apps unless they fulfil specific criterias for example
[00:42:09] <Brekkjern> Apple might even stop removing apps themselves if it means continuing would make them liable to content in those apps
[00:42:22] <Brekkjern> As they take an editorial role
[00:42:51] <Brekkjern> I'm spitballing here, but these are legal arguments you could make. Some might just require a few minor changes to the law and it would sail right through the court
[00:44:13] <Brekkjern> Not that these arguments were relevant to the Epic v Apple case though
