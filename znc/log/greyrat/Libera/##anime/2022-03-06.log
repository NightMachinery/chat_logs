[00:01:06] <emmeka> MootPoot that's not how liens tied to a mortgage work.
[00:01:38] <MootPoot> ? I never said it was tied to a mortgage?
[00:01:45] <emmeka> it's also irrelevant, by virtue of my mortgage there is already the same lien against my house, all this does is allow me to access the maximum of the credit I was granted in the initial mortgage.
[00:02:00] <MootPoot> just the idea of not being able to sell a car you bought when you feel like it

[00:02:08] <emmeka> MootPoot I assume this is in response to, yesterday, you thinking it was outrageous that I would voluntarily get a home equity line of credit
[00:02:11] <MootPoot> oh
[00:02:14] <emmeka> and that this made no sense to you
[00:02:15] <MootPoot> no
[00:02:18] <MootPoot> this is unrelated
[00:02:34] <MootPoot> I was just youtoob watching
[00:02:50] <MootPoot> the idea of a dealer keeping you from selling a thing YOU own
[00:02:59] <MootPoot> I looked up the house lien thing myself later
[00:04:27] <emmeka> besides if it's a $1 lien, just discharge it?
[00:04:41] <MootPoot> like - if they say its to protect the local market from US buyers why not just specify the car has to be kept locally rather then preventing it being sold to anyone - although I guess the next buyer isen't really bound by any laws
[00:04:50] <MootPoot> can you just pay a 1$ lien?
[00:05:06] <MootPoot> idk - the video made it seem like it was a massive legal pita
[00:07:09] <MootPoot> maybe I'm missing something
[00:12:16] <teus> welp, kuzu no honkai turns dark real fast
[00:28:54] <MootPoot> I am offended
[00:31:30] <emmeka> MootPoot yes, liens are just ways to secure debt, and if you discharge the debt you discharge the lien.

[03:51:42] <Fenderbassist> good morning amigojapan how are you?
[03:54:30] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: not bad for the day after the vaccine
[03:56:40] <Fenderbassist> glad that you're doing well with it
[03:56:44] <Fenderbassist> that is important
[03:56:50] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I was supposed to have work today, but I took the day off just in case I felt terrible
[03:57:00] <Fenderbassist> good idea
[03:58:10] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: besides my arm being a littlle sore, I feel fine
[03:58:40] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: tho tomako was fomplaining last night thet this was the worst time for her

[03:59:04] <Fenderbassist> I regret to hear that, some people do not do well with the vaccines

[04:00:07] <Fenderbassist> so what else is new in amigo world?
[04:00:10] <MootPoot> that wants cuddles
[04:00:35] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: the social setting you walk into well dressed and gainfully employed and prepared to show a girl a long series of fun nights out
[04:00:39] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: ummm, new, let me think....
[04:02:21] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: social, well dressed, gainfully employed and prepared to show a girl fun
[04:02:22] <MootPoot> hm
[04:02:36] <MootPoot> all of those things are out of my avility
[04:02:49] <amigojapan> for me it was harder to find a date than an interview
[04:03:11] <MootPoot> amigojapan: how did you ask tomako out 
[04:03:35] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: sounds like you want a call girl more than a girl friend?
[04:03:48] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: I want a gf
[04:03:55] <MootPoot> but I'm not social enough to get one
[04:03:57] <Fenderbassist> a gf is a lot of work
[04:04:02] <MootPoot> nor do I have a job
[04:04:05] <Fenderbassist> you need to be gainfully employed
[04:04:09] <MootPoot> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[04:04:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: we were at a hostel where she was working, and I told the other staff members I like tomako, so they helped set us up
[04:04:13] * MootPoot is unemployed
[04:04:15] <Fenderbassist> once you are employed, you can look around locally
[04:04:26] <Fenderbassist> so focus on employment first
[04:04:57] <Fenderbassist> the old saying, "No money, no honey"
[04:05:13] <Fenderbassist> if you want a honey (a girlfriend) you gotta be "socially viable"
[04:05:17] <Fenderbassist> with a job
[04:05:30] <MootPoot> ugh
[04:05:48] <Fenderbassist> that's how the game works
[04:05:58] <MootPoot> its just like
[04:06:04] <MootPoot> I've been fine wihtout a gf for a long itme
[04:06:16] <Fenderbassist> I understand
[04:06:18] <MootPoot> its now just that in the next 5 years I see myslef doing everything I really ever wanted to
[04:06:26] <MootPoot> so now I'm like
[04:06:32] <MootPoot> wtf else do I do with the rest of my life
[04:06:42] <MootPoot> before I was just busy with my own shit
[04:06:45] <MootPoot> so idgaf
[04:06:46] <Fenderbassist> after you've done everything you've wanted to do, you settle down
[04:07:05] <MootPoot> yeah...I'm almost to that point - anything I wanted to do I can still do so

[04:07:40] <Fenderbassist> as you go
[04:07:45] <Fenderbassist> you'll do fine with it
[04:08:02] <Fenderbassist> just focus on the career, once you have that you can build everything else around it
[04:08:05] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: that about no money no honey sounds more like for marrige than for a GF, GF is much less formal no?
[04:08:42] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: to a point, you still have to have money to date, take a girl places and such
[04:08:58] <amigojapan> right
[04:08:59] <Fenderbassist> with the cost of living, that usually means being gainfully employed
[04:09:10] <Fenderbassist> things are so expensive
[04:09:11] <amigojapan> I see
[04:09:22] <MootPoot> I'll probably not have my own house for a long time so
[04:09:32] <MootPoot> with the hyperinflaiton
[04:09:42] <Fenderbassist> house is usually the endgame
[04:09:48] <Fenderbassist> apartment is fine as long as you have a job
[04:09:57] <Fenderbassist> that pays your bills and for your hobbies
[04:10:05] <Fenderbassist> at which point you're prepared for dating

[04:24:26] <Fenderbassist> once you've done some of that, will be much easier moving out on your own, which is super expensive
[04:25:25] <MootPoot> tbh I might not move out at all until I can buy my own house
[04:25:38] <Fenderbassist> that would be a very good move if you can do it

[04:42:55] <marblesurf> for realsies?
[04:43:00] <ButterNoodle> yea
[04:43:03] <marblesurf> from the looks of it it looks like generic shit
[04:43:08] <marblesurf> which isn't a bad thing per se.
[04:43:39] <ButterNoodle> if u watch it and feel nothing for marin.. ur inhuman waste
[04:44:06] <ButterNoodle> might as well just eat from the toilet at a biden rally if they actually had any
[04:44:15] <ButterNoodle> might as well just eat from the toilet at a trump rally if they actually had any
[04:44:51] <ButterNoodle> all I'm sayin.. ur probably a lizard person
[04:44:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: once you get a job you can get a home loan, and start paying for your house slowly
[04:45:06] <ButterNoodle> home loans are a scam
[04:45:22] <ButterNoodle> I am a victim
[04:45:47] <ButterNoodle> just like wives.. I'll probably get another tho
[04:46:39] <Fenderbassist> save your money, buy your home cash
[04:46:44] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: in canada do u get a military discount if u serve?
[04:46:50] <Fenderbassist> will save you hundreds of thousands of dollars (equivalent)
[04:47:03] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: I'd argue that if u can get a VA loan - thats well worth the time served
[04:47:08] <ButterNoodle> except for the getting shot at part
[04:47:14] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: but that will take forevevr to save up I think

[04:47:39] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: sometimes just saving up a good downpayment
[04:47:42] <ButterNoodle> mortgages typically work out to what rent would cost tho

[04:48:00] <ButterNoodle> 5, 10, 20 % down

[07:05:49] <Satin> did you do taylor series
[07:05:58] <snake> i am thinking of just doing the optional calc 2 and 3 but...

[07:07:19] <MootPoot> study
[07:07:30] <weedoe> god help me when i decide to take calc ii
[07:07:32] <snake> dooom
[07:07:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, back in the college days I kind of wanted to get a gf. Now that I just want to stick with my imouto :3
[07:07:53] <Satin> how do i study is the problem
[07:07:59] <Satin> I'm not scared of calculus or any of these topics per se
[07:08:06] <Satin> but i'm scared of exams
[07:08:09] <Satin> and how to prepare
[07:08:13] <Sadale> snake, good luck! :3
[07:08:13] <MootPoot> Satin: I've done about 80% of that but it was in advanced math in HS - my math in Uni was basically just a repeat of that stuff
[07:08:16] <Satin> ????? literally do not know how to balance everything
[07:08:21] <Sadale> snake, lol don't worry about those dumb college courses. They're often lame and outdated and easy to pass :P
[07:08:24] <Satin> MootPoot:  80% of that? 
[07:08:31] <Satin> MootPoot: what's the arc length of a curve
[07:08:32] <Satin> go
[07:08:40] <snake> Sadale, ours are very modern
[07:09:01] <MootPoot> its the lenth of a curve - like if you have a section of a pie
[07:09:10] <snake> Sadale, i was at this same uni like 8 years ago, it was old then. but they got new professors for CS and are teaching it hardcore sicko mode from the get go
[07:09:11] <MootPoot> then the outer part - if you cut a slice out
[07:09:19] <MootPoot> how long the outer edge is
[07:09:20] <MootPoot> like
[07:09:21] <snake> now

[07:13:02] <MootPoot> nah
[07:13:07] <Satin> i see
[07:13:12] <MootPoot> I think we did something that looked similar
[07:13:18] <Satin> yeah not surprised calc 2 has a bit of HS stuff but it's a bit more advanced
[07:13:35] <MootPoot> I never took math in uni
[07:13:48] <MootPoot> my advanced math for HS completely nulled out my requirement
[07:13:54] <MootPoot> I just got equivalancy for it
[07:13:59] <Satin> lucky bit-
[07:14:01] <Satin> jfc.
[07:14:15] <Satin> imagine never seeing math in univeristy
[07:14:16] <Satin> god
[07:14:18] <Satin> how the fuck
[07:14:23] <Satin> MootPoot: discrete math??????????????????
[07:14:32] <MootPoot> yeah that was in advanced math
[07:14:43] <MootPoot> like , advanced math isen't a second math class
[07:14:43] <Satin> .-.
[07:14:46] <MootPoot> its like super honors

[07:14:49] <MootPoot> extra
[07:14:53] <MootPoot> completely not needed to graduate
[07:15:26] <MootPoot> they call it advanced but its more like extra math
[07:15:33] <MootPoot> you still have to do the base math courses
[07:15:37] <Satin> i see
[07:15:53] <Satin> i'm just a bit angrier at myself now, this is HS level math for the most part ree!111111
[07:15:59] <MootPoot> no, its not
[07:16:06] <MootPoot> I took it in HS - but its not considered HS
[07:16:19] <MootPoot> also , taking it in HS made the marking super ez
[07:16:23] <Satin> the biggest issue is having "hope/faith" in one's self to be able to pull through despite strong setbacks :pleading:
[07:16:36] <MootPoot> there were only like 5 students and the teacher basically babied us all through it

[07:17:29] <Satin> ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
[07:17:39] <Satin> MootPoot: getting all the bitches
[07:17:59] <Satin> i was just homeschooled
[07:18:05] <Satin> and not getting taught anything by my parents
[07:18:06] <Satin> at all
[07:18:12] <Satin> i was on irc, discord and things like that
[07:18:20] <Satin> reading a lot of things, but not learning STEM things
[07:18:28] <Satin> afraid to try programming assuming it required math
[07:18:33] <MootPoot> before I had my final HS exam my parents paid for a tutor 
[07:18:36] <MootPoot> for the last month
[07:18:41] <MootPoot> was worth it, although expensive
[07:18:44] <MootPoot> also an older onee-sama
[07:18:46] <MootPoot> :3
[07:18:48] <Satin> ...
[07:18:57] <Satin> i had one guy teaching me fractions when i was like 15
[07:19:01] <Satin> that my parents hired
[07:19:08] <Satin> and some algebra thing but it was all ---
[07:19:16] <Satin> and he only stuck around for a little bit
[07:19:29] <Satin> i taught myself algebra 1 from a book before community college in 2017
[07:19:37] <Satin> and placed into college algebra level
[07:19:52] <Satin> when i saw trig for the first time in my life
[07:19:59] *** Quits: treeman5 (~treeman5@user/treeman5) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:20:02] <Satin> i failed that class, had to retake it, the prof was going too fast
[07:20:03] <MootPoot> I wonder when I started liking the older onee-sama architype
[07:20:11] <Satin> but then i retook it with a lovely professor named robert
[07:20:18] <Satin> who, despite his firm anti-snowflake rethoric in class
[07:20:20] <MootPoot> hi its me robert
[07:20:21] <Satin> was a wonderful person
[07:20:22] *** Joins: treeman5 (~treeman5@user/treeman5)
[07:20:29] <Satin> nad had a personality
[07:20:35] <Satin> i miss you Dr. Robert...
[07:20:43] <Satin> i understood trig entirely that semester.
[07:20:48] <Satin> I nailed it with As...in community college
[07:21:12] <Satin> then when i took calculus in fall 2019, i almost got an A, only didn't do so well because i started working at chic fil A
[07:21:14] <MootPoot> btw the only reason I took it early was cuz I was a lonely kid
[07:21:18] <MootPoot> with not many friends
[07:21:20] <MootPoot> so I had the time
[07:21:23] <Satin> so I got a B
[07:21:31] <Satin> but the professor knew i would have gotten an A lolll
[07:21:37] <MootPoot> and my teacher/advisor told me that its a LOT easier if I take the class earlier
[07:21:38] <MootPoot> so I did
[07:22:01] <MootPoot> I do want to study math more, but I have a lot of shit on my todo plate
[07:22:03] <MootPoot> so
[07:22:20] <Satin> i skipped the spring 2020 semester
[07:22:23] <MootPoot> the only math I want to care about now is just computational / discrete
[07:22:35] <Satin> my reasoning was, i'm transferring in fall 2020, why take calc 2 at my community college
[07:22:43] <MootPoot> ....
[07:22:44] <Satin> so i didn't take any classes in fall 2020 and just started working at chic fil A
[07:22:51] <MootPoot> yeah you shoulda done that
[07:22:55] <Satin> ..............
[07:22:57] <Satin> i know
[07:22:59] <MootPoot> I never took a single semester off
[07:23:06] <Satin> i wanted the hard version of calc 2 at my new school
[07:23:13] <Satin> instead of in community college where my perception was it was a bit easier
[07:23:15] <MootPoot> I always sceduled the hard classes during the spring semester
[07:23:20] <Satin> then fall 2020 happened, and i realized i wasn't ready after a year of skipping classes
[07:23:21] <Satin> so
[07:23:26] <Satin> i took calc 1 again
[07:23:27] <MootPoot> where the class sizes were small
[07:23:29] <Satin> got a B again, but this time
[07:23:32] <Satin> Fall 2020 was hell
[07:23:37] <Satin> COVID happened
[07:23:43] <Satin> the school was hard to get used to
[07:23:48] <Satin> with no in person classes
[07:24:02] <Satin> and this new school was retarded about online class schedules too, my calc 1 class was at 7 am
[07:24:32] <Satin> anyhow i barely survived that semester, 2 As, 1 B, and 1 D in gen chem 1 purely because i didn't study for that class at all while balancing workload in other classes
[07:24:52] <Satin> but i think i got traumatized in some way in  the process with anxiety, i remember driving back to missouri feeling really fucked over
[07:25:00] <Satin> and then i got shot in missouri while doordashing 
[07:25:07] <Satin> right before the spring 2021 semester started
[07:25:16] <Satin> so i missed the entire spring 2021 semester
[07:25:17] <Satin> and now nothing is the same anymo
[07:25:19] <Satin> re
[07:25:32] <Satin> what is studying? what is getting A grades like back in community college?
[07:25:44] <Satin> what is confidence?
[07:25:55] <MootPoot> no such thing as confidence
[07:25:59] <Satin> true :/
[07:26:02] <MootPoot> just have to do the task at hand
[07:26:04] <MootPoot> that's it
[07:26:07] <MootPoot> fuck the results
[07:26:11] <MootPoot> just do the thing
[07:26:11] <Satin> fall 2021 was hell
[07:26:15] <Satin> PTSD hell
[07:26:20] <Satin> i withdrew from all classes
[07:26:24] <Satin> and now i'm taking it again in the spring
[07:26:32] <Satin> strong start. I worked for 5 weeks straight
[07:26:40] <Satin> then i mental boomed last weekend finally
[07:27:02] <Satin> and didn't study for physics test, and didn't do hot on that one, and then was cracking under pressure for the calc 2 test soooooooo
[07:27:32] <Satin> but all is not as bad this semester. unlike last semester, I know what's up in physics class. I know what's up in calc 2 class. Execution is lacking. But I'm not behind or anything in terms of awareness of what's going on.
[07:27:41] <Satin> I'm getting straight As in my physics labs
[07:28:11] <Satin> the one class i'm fucking up on is my major related class - algos and data structures but that's b/c my professor's chinese accent....
[07:28:15] * Satin sighs
[07:28:59] <Satin> you know what's funny? I got good grades on HW 1, HW 2, but now for HW 3 i've used up all late days, and will get a 30% penalty i think after submitting 👀 in CS

[11:18:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I did not get my local equivalent, no.
[11:18:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> BFS & DFS are relatively simple. But the easiest way to grok them besides just... literally drawing it out on paper, is to implement filesystem traversal in some shitty script.
[11:19:40] <MootPoot> I feel like I have enough surrounding experience and stuff to get me through, but I also feel like I'm probably gonna be in hot water the entire time
[11:19:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Like a lot of things, formal studies led to formalizing knowledge I had partly gotten informally from fucking around.
[11:20:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Generalizing things I knew specific subcases of.
[11:20:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For those things that were entirely new to me, I found that looking up such specific use-cases helped concretize the notions and make them easier to understand.
[11:21:33] <MootPoot> half of the fear is just going back to the non-applied ways of learning things
[11:21:48] <MootPoot> when I see a math formula that dosen't do a thing that I can understand
[11:21:52] <MootPoot> my eyes glaze over

[11:27:09] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I asked my HS teacher what the fuck an intergration does 
[11:27:17] <MootPoot> he was like
[11:27:19] <MootPoot> it integrates
[11:27:24] <MootPoot> .....
[11:27:33] <MootPoot> what the fuck do I do with it
[11:27:35] <MootPoot> no idea
[11:27:36] <Berlin36> In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. The process of finding integrals is called integration.

[11:28:23] <Berlin36> then i've read like 30 seconds on the internet and my understanding of it completely changed

[11:32:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There is no real reason to use non-public-domain math textbooks for any undergrad work.
[11:32:23] <Berlin36> btw can you learn math by yourself at home?
[11:32:38] <MootPoot> Berlin36: yes - its how I had to figure it out

[11:49:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'd be more impressed by an i5-equivalent taking 5mW than something two magnitudes faster but taking 100w
[11:50:09] <MootPoot> one thing which always annoys me are those ultrabooks
[11:50:19] <MootPoot> 1400 dollars for a i5 and 1800 for a i7
[11:50:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Particularly because clustering those 5mW i5s would lead to better performance for less power.

[13:32:42] <Bco1981_2> unfortunately i threw out my lat crt tv, which worked perfectly
[13:32:43] <JesseDesu> with a picture of a CRT
[13:34:10] <Bco1981_2> the thing is. i could actually use this old pc, as my main. EVEN on linux. but, there is no sound. unless i use a usb headset
[13:34:34] <JesseDesu> what about a DAC usb
[13:34:37] <JesseDesu> like FiiO
[13:34:51] <JesseDesu> thats how i connect to my linux laptop
[13:35:21] <Bco1981_2> i would rather the hardware i already have, works.

[13:42:58] <JesseDesu> it crops it actually
[13:43:05] <Bco1981_2> it's the pro quake fov feel

[13:44:22] <mixfix41> my nick
[13:44:29] <Bco1981_2> kinda, but i'm not very good at it.
[13:44:44] <JesseDesu> i love being able to bunnyhop back in 1999 when less than 2% knew how to do it on most public servers
[13:44:54] <JesseDesu> nowadays everyone can do it
[13:44:59] <JesseDesu> the playing field is leveled
[13:45:15] <JesseDesu> also, the devs reduced it a lot
[13:45:52] <JesseDesu> it used to be i would fire a slanted rocket jump to launch myself like a bunnyhopping missile
[13:52:09] <mixfix41> you know i actually got into apex legends and just run windows when i play fps come to think of it
[13:53:33] <mixfix41> ig titanfalls was another big title before apex
[13:53:55] <mixfix41> there was a 4th of july hack and it was demanding the company respawn deal with hacks in titanfalls not sure what came of that
[13:54:32] <mixfix41> pekora playing bangalore she has good field awareness

[23:23:50] <isekaijin> But you have to know the video ID beforehand pass it to mpv.
[23:24:14] <MootPoot> It might be some fuckery with an adblocker
[23:24:46] <Bco1981> so you have to find the video on a browser to get it in mpv ?... why even bother with mpv at that point ?

[23:26:45] <isekaijin> Bco1981: Actually, most of the video I play come from Discord. If Discord wrote the chat history to a normal local text file, then I would simply scan that text file with a script and fetch the video ID.
[23:26:51] <Bco1981> i would be annoyed by pictures and what not in my irc window.

[23:28:34] <MootPoot> I don't wanna be a webshit
[23:28:51] <MootPoot> do trams  count as trains
[23:31:01] <isekaijin> There is this cultural difference between IRC and these newfangled webshit-made chats like Slack, Discord, etc.
[23:31:28] <MootPoot> as for that part it seems like where you go really
[23:31:32] <isekaijin> On IRC, if you aren't paying attention to a channel, you effectively aren't there.
[23:31:45] <MootPoot> ?
[23:31:56] <MootPoot> >On IRC, if you aren't paying attention to a channel, you effectively aren't there.
[23:31:56] <MootPoot> thats true of the others too
[23:31:57] <isekaijin> Nobody expects you to go out of your way to see what someone said when you weren't there.
[23:32:14] <MootPoot> Idk what discord servers you're on but 
[23:32:19] <MootPoot> that's not the case in any of mine
[23:32:20] <MootPoot> at all
[23:32:38] <isekaijin> Well, at least on Slack, it's like “go read what someone said two days ago”.
[23:32:54] <isekaijin> And I'm like “fuck, are you serious?”
[23:34:07] <Bco1981> i get the same feels when i get the "read the man"
[23:34:20] <isekaijin> An IRC server won't remember what you said for later use.
[23:34:24] <MootPoot> aside from explicit announcements that the channel/server owner made which gets pushed with the channel - but IRC has the same thing with its announcements
[23:34:33] <isekaijin> I mean, the server owner might keep logs for their own use.
[23:34:37] <Bco1981> i still haven't been able to get a useful command out of looking a a man page.
[23:34:40] <isekaijin> But not for yours.
[23:34:40] <MootPoot> so it does remember....
[23:34:55] <MootPoot> Bco1981: check the woman page
[23:35:05] <Bco1981> that might help
[23:36:00] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: u get that soundblaster live in ur win95 pc?
[23:36:08] <MootPoot> dump 12ga in ur pc
[23:36:24] * MootPoot makes a docker image of ButterNoodle 
[23:36:32] <ButterNoodle> dock w me bb
[23:36:36] <Bco1981> ... i got it in my core2quad debian yes. but. surprise. could not be detected.
[23:36:44] <MootPoot> I'm going to vagrant with your docker
[23:36:46] <ButterNoodle> ha
[23:36:59] <ButterNoodle> shoulda used an awe32
[23:37:01] <Bco1981> not sure if it's the pci slots or the card
[23:37:03] <MootPoot> Bco1981: the problem is that you're not using arch
[23:37:04] <Bco1981> lol
[23:37:09] <ButterNoodle> yes
[23:37:11] <ButterNoodle> use arch
[23:37:13] <ButterNoodle> ez
[23:37:13] <ButterNoodle> gg
[23:37:33] <Bco1981> i will test that audio card with windows 10 on same pc. then try arch on it
[23:37:37] <isekaijin> Bco1981: Most man pages are super concise. They aren't terribly useful if you want to know absolutely everything about how to use a command.
[23:37:40] <ButterNoodle> in other news
[23:38:04] <isekaijin> At least to me they are mostly useful as reminders rather than as actual manuals.
[23:38:09] <ButterNoodle> my spdif out on my game pc goes white noise full volume after about 10-15 min of overwatch..
[23:38:21] <isekaijin> OTOH, info pages (when they exist) are painfully verbose.
[23:38:22] <ButterNoodle> *updated driver, maybe thats the fix
[23:38:27] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: you didnt manage to fix that?
[23:38:28] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: wow...
[23:38:47] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I did temporally by going back to analog :3
[23:39:02] <ButterNoodle> but bought a new dac to see if thats the issue
[23:39:16] <ButterNoodle> and new drivers.. we will see...
[23:40:53] <MootPoot> I feel weird
[23:41:11] <MootPoot> I haven't ordered food from outside in so long
[23:41:13] <MootPoot> its like
[23:41:22] <MootPoot> every time I look at the price and how long it'll take
[23:41:27] <MootPoot> I just go down and make it myself
[23:41:49] <ButterNoodle> yep
[23:41:56] * ButterNoodle watches MootPoot grow up
[23:41:57] <Bco1981> don't order at prime time
[23:42:11] <MootPoot> Bco1981: is noon on a weekend primetime?
[23:42:15] <ButterNoodle> imagine paying 10x what it costs to do it urself
[23:42:27] <ButterNoodle> thats why I just jerk myself off
[23:42:37] <ButterNoodle> thats free all fuckin day long
[23:42:37] <MootPoot> 22 dollars to get food ( 15 for food + rest is delivery and charges ) 
[23:42:44] <lastonestanding> imagine cumming without touching 'it'
[23:42:44] <Bco1981> i order 16.45 ish then sure we get early dinner... but it arrives fast.
[23:42:47] <MootPoot> and I have to wait an hour
[23:43:17] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: there is that, I havent figured out "hand free cumming" without a lil help
[23:43:36] <ButterNoodle> we have hands free everything else.. why not that?
[23:44:53] <MootPoot> we do

[23:45:23] <MootPoot> you asked for hands free,  not money free
[23:45:26] <MootPoot> :3
[23:45:30] <ButterNoodle> it would be cheaper to find college girls that need "book money"
[23:45:39] <MootPoot> lol
[23:45:43] <ButterNoodle> ButterNoodle> thats free all fuckin day long
[23:46:36] <ButterNoodle> the plus side to college girls.. u dont have to clean them out or look at them afterwords.. the guilt is the same tho
