[00:02:31] <MootPoot> even though people have like 4k smartphones or whatever

[00:03:03] <Bco1981> youtube compression is bad
[00:04:10] <MootPoot> its not even youtube, its everything
[00:04:20] <Bco1981> oh
[00:04:28] <MootPoot> like - I've seen videos from tiktok or twitter
[00:04:37] <MootPoot> its all shite
[00:04:52] <MootPoot> can they at least hold it in a half decent res
[00:05:27] <Bco1981> sounds like some screencapture thing and edit, render to a long video at high compression. that will get there.
[00:05:30] <MootPoot> buy a 15k USD DSLR to take your cosplay pics that then gets cucked to shit by downscaling and compression
[00:05:52] <Cryowolf> dslr are no longer manufactured
[00:05:52] <Bco1981> that's why my MMD videos are so big
[00:05:57] <Cryowolf> now it's just mirrorless
[00:06:01] <MootPoot> ?
[00:06:04] <Bco1981> and beat sbaer videos too.
[00:06:09] <MootPoot> new dslrs are still coming out

[00:07:52] <ImoutoBot> [title] It's here! The Canon EOS R5 C is an 8K 60p camera with "no limitations on shooting" | Digital Camera World
[00:07:56] <Cryowolf> DSLR are being phased out in favor of mirrorless. I do't know why
[00:08:00] <MootPoot> this one just got announced like 30 days ago
[00:08:20] <MootPoot> tbh there's not much of a difference between the two
[00:08:41] <MootPoot> its the same sensor ( depending on what you get ) all you give up is the viewfinder
[00:08:50] <MootPoot> DSLRs took a massive hit from smartphones
[00:09:10] <MootPoot> mirrorless is smaller - has the hope of recapturing those camera buyers
[00:09:16] <Cryowolf> and that canon one is mirrorless afaik
[00:09:19] <MootPoot> since you dont have to drag shit around
[00:09:46] <Cryowolf> I want to drag shit around, lenses are important
[00:10:13] <MootPoot> well, you still have interchangeable lenses
[00:10:21] <MootPoot> its just that the body is smaller
[00:10:36] <Cryowolf> yeah and quality takes a small hit, depth of field does too
[00:10:48] <MootPoot> does it?
[00:10:49] <Cryowolf> it's something they need to work around
[00:10:53] <MootPoot> the sensor is the same one
[00:11:17] <Cryowolf> something to do with shutter, light etc
[00:12:29] <MootPoot> idk enough about cameras to tell
[00:12:49] <Cryowolf> I can't figure out if sony nex-vg30 is mirrorless or dslr. It's a camcorder with lenses
[00:12:57] <Cryowolf> I own it, but I don't know
[00:13:28] <Cryowolf> would almost have to be mirrorless right?
[00:13:44] <MootPoot> tbh LCDs are getting much better
[00:14:05] <Cryowolf> whats LCD got to do with it?
[00:14:25] <MootPoot> wasen't the original point of viewfinders just that we had nothing no display what the camera "sees" as well
[00:14:37] <Bco1981> i took this picture with my phone https://imgur.com/a/oTHLre9
[00:14:37] <ImoutoBot> [title] Imgur: The magic of the Internet
[00:14:53] <Cryowolf> I dunno....viewfinders of the past were also behind the picture
[00:14:53] <MootPoot> now that LCDs are good enough - you can pass on the viewfinder?
[00:15:10] <MootPoot> those mirrorless units still have LCD's
[00:15:11] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, that looks boring though
[00:15:19] <Cryowolf> no offense
[00:15:25] <Cryowolf> also lacks HDRI
[00:15:42] <MootPoot> Bco1981: wasszup with the fisheye
[00:15:52] <Cryowolf> that's panoramc
[00:15:54] <Cryowolf> panoramic
[00:15:56] <Cryowolf> not fisheye
[00:16:00] <Bco1981> yeah
[00:16:35] <Cryowolf> my sony nex-vg30 has an OLED viewfinder with no latency pretty much
[00:17:12] <MootPoot> cockeye
[00:17:32] <Cryowolf> I dunno what cameras take in megapixel these days
[00:17:39] <Cryowolf> but this one takes 16megapixels
[00:18:09] <Cryowolf> and can capture HDRI for photos so I get the full range of light info
[00:18:38] <Cryowolf> sadly not for video
[00:18:54] <Cryowolf> I still wanna sell it though

[02:48:15] <Matt|home> The use of the words "I" or "we", Professor Sarma added, "causes or doesn't cause the transformation that is intended".
[02:48:15] <Matt|home> "If you say it incorrectly, the person who is intended to be baptised is not transformed," he added. "If they go along and proceed as Catholics and have other sacraments in the future, it is all based on the fallacy that they were, in fact, transformed."
[02:48:52] <Matt|home> oh. a FALLACY. i see. i fallacy that they were transformed. pray tell how were they transformed.. was it an absolute value function that got stretched?

[05:26:16] <Roey> even still, rice & beans on their own won't give you that.  If you limit your portion then it'll just give you less heartburn.  Listen to your body, it's sending you signals..

[06:57:24] <sentionics> MootPoot, you'll need to 3D print an even larger pp to defend yourself with.
[06:57:27] <PancakeMatsuri> sentionics, just how horrible the real thing is

[06:58:19] <sentionics> PancakeMatsuri, varies from person to person of course. My uncle lost his sense of taste for a good little while but is better now.
[06:58:46] <sentionics> PancakeMatsuri, I personally fear the loss of taste thing a lot. So I'll definitely keep eating those booster shot sick days every 6 months.
[06:59:50] <sentionics> also, if booster side effects are so awful for a day or two, the real thing would indeed really suck. 1 - 2 weeks easily, of a worse version of that.
[07:01:10] <sentionics> PancakeMatsuri, I think I basically just took ibuprofen and maybe some melatonin and just stayed in bed through a lot of my side effects, but sitting up I actually felt better than laying down.

[07:01:32] <PancakeMatsuri> sentionics, well, it's not that awful, I just hoped that's how the real thing would be

[10:15:33] <MootPoot> I could do stuff like tank models
[10:15:35] <mexen> What have you modeled so far? Phallic things I bet. Behold, 3D Rodman

[10:15:48] <mexen> I am curious to see what you come up with
[10:15:55] <MootPoot> so far I've just printed small utilities and test prints

[10:16:12] <mexen> Hello World!
[10:16:25] <MootPoot> utilities like cable management clips and screw sizing utilities
[10:17:08] <mexen> That's a good use case actually now that you mention it. And other stuff to add to the desk like headphone holders and such

[21:18:47] <isekaijin> ButterNoodle: Ah, damn.
[21:19:02] <isekaijin> Seriously, the Discord client is so unusable for certain operations.
[21:19:41] <isekaijin> If I want to copy someone else's nick to the clipboard, I need to click and drag.
[21:20:26] <isekaijin> I right-clicked on someone's nick to see if the context menu had a ‚Äúcopy nick‚Äù option... and I ended up accidentally inviting them to another server.
[21:20:36] <isekaijin> With textual logs, I just look for what I want in a damned text editor.
[21:20:54] <isekaijin> Webshits think they're making everything better, but they're making everything worse.

[22:20:26] <isekaijin> MootPoot: ‚Äúyou dont use double click to highlight the text?‚Äù... I use the keyboard.
[22:21:06] <isekaijin> Any half-decent text editor lets you navigate a text file conveniently using the keyboard.
[22:21:42] <isekaijin> Also, in Discord, you can't double click on a nick if you want to select it.
[22:22:33] <isekaijin> Left clicking on a nick opens a context popup. Right clicking on a nick opens a different context menu.
[22:22:33] <MootPoot> Double clicking on a nick works for me 
[22:22:43] <MootPoot> Unless you're talking about the chat window
[22:22:59] <MootPoot> Not the profile popup 
[22:23:02] <isekaijin> Of course I'm talking about the chat window.
[22:23:18] <isekaijin> Because I'm not going to scroll a list of who knows how many nicks.
[22:23:34] <MootPoot> That's why you go to the profile popup
[22:23:37] <isekaijin> That's also more inconvenient in Discord.
[22:23:42] <MootPoot> It always has the OG username 
[22:23:59] <isekaijin> In WeeChat, I just press F11 (resp. F12) to scroll the nick list up (resp. down).
[22:24:01] <MootPoot> Nanobot: working on it, how long 
[22:24:05] <MootPoot> Does it take 
[22:24:35] <MootPoot> Although wonky right clicks is a issue in most webapps
[22:24:41] <Nanobot> It didn't take me very long at all to write that dialog.
