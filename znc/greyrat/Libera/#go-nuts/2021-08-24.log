[00:28:09] <rootbox> Is there any good tutorial/explaination how stubs work? i kinda fail how to apply it to my use case

[00:31:54] <A_Dragon> Define stub?
[00:32:04] <A_Dragon> as in stub methods to fit an interface
[00:32:06] <A_Dragon> ?
[00:34:30] <rootbox> I want to write test for an http handler, the handler calls a function that returns a bool and i want it predictable for my tests and not going to an actual db
[00:35:33] <rootbox> and try since a day to get it work but i have some issues to understand it correctly (or better to refactor the code correctly)

[00:48:03] <rootbox> i fail to integrate to integrate it into my test. That's the handler where i wan't to stub/mock result.Healthy: http://ix.io/3wLO
[00:48:38] <rootbox> i simply don't understand how i manipulate the function result
[00:49:17] <rootbox> that's more or less the the healthcheck i use: https://github.com/sttts/galera-healthcheck/blob/master/healthcheck/healthcheck.go
