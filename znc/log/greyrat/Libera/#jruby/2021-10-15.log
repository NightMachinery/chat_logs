[00:18:11] <headius> odd assert failure in this job, no idea how this could ever happen...
[00:18:17] <headius> https://app.travis-ci.com/github/jruby/jruby/jobs/543283521
[00:18:34] <headius> tried to reproduce in a loop here and it never fails
[01:36:36] <headius> I think I figured out the problem with https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/5729
[01:37:01] <headius> CRuby will store times as rational if it can't represent them exactly as a float
[01:37:19] <headius> we force the time into long for millis and nsec and in the process lose some precision
[01:41:01] <headius> the value that fails in that test is not representable in a binary float

[02:12:08] <headius> enebo: I pushed some changes there to fix the regression but unsure if it undoes what you hoped the patch would accomplish
[02:12:49] <headius> fixing the Time.at value was only half the game, because the math in your patch still ended up putting the value in a double that could not accurately hold this value
[02:13:13] <headius> BigDecimal fixes that but may regress something else that expected different precision

[21:43:16] <AndyMaleh[m]> Hi, I just reported another attempt to push a gem using the latest jruby-9.3.1.0: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6871 Help is appreciated. I would be happy to provide more debugging/troubleshooting info if needed.
[21:43:53] <AndyMaleh[m]> Otherwise, thank you for continuing to maintain JRuby. It is great to have as an option in the Ruby community to take advantage of everything JVM in Ruby.
