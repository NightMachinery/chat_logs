[03:19:39] <oerheks> cocomo, likely in the standard folder?

[05:33:36] <redhelmet> trash was the 1st thing i emptied

I was trying to do so, then get into an issue while trying to create a new VM, the virt-manager warned me that the emulator might not be able to access the folder where the ISO I was trying to install was sitting, and proposed to mess all the permission to make it work. Obviously I politely refused but I did
[17:02:47] <mitaro> not find any good info on how this is supposed to work. Shall I create a home directory just for the emulator? How user/groups are supposed to be set?
[17:03:30] <ravage> and why dont you just let it set the permission for the iso?

[17:07:13] <mitaro> ravage: setting the permissions only for the ISO file will not work unless I grant access to all the folders on top of it - which I do not think is a good idea. I could create a new "home" folder for the emulator, where to store ISOs and disk images (I need to store them somewhere as well, and /var/lib/libvirt... does not sound a good place -
[17:07:14] <mitaro> limited space there) but what user/group it should belong to? libvirt/kvm?
[17:07:23] <jsbach> hi, i am using nemo as filemanager. Does nemo support dark theme?
[17:09:04] <ravage> mitaro: how does changing permissions use more space? let virt-manager set the permissions and it works. it only modifies the permissions of that file and maybe sets the x flag for the folder

[23:01:54] <Maik> go into the system settings and set the Anitmation Speed higher
[23:01:59] <GoldkingG4> is there any program for that? like baidu pc faster?

[23:02:12] <Maik> GoldkingG4: as said no
[23:02:22] <GoldkingG4> oh
[23:02:36] <GoldkingG4> i heard there was stuff like stacer or bleachvbit
[23:03:21] <Maik> not recommended to use those, if you don't know what you're doing you could end up with a bricked system
[23:03:21] <Mathisen> thats mostly usefull for diskcleanup
[23:03:33] <oerheks> those exists, but they just remove unused files, it does not really speed up.
[23:03:38] <Maik> autremove should do
[23:04:06] <GoldkingG4> so you guys are saying it is much more simple to speed up in ubuntu than on windows
[23:04:10] <oerheks> any 'pc faster' tool on windows is just a scam :-D
