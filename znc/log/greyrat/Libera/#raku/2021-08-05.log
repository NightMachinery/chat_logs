[04:36:28] <moon-child> and \v seems like an analogous case; in regex, it matches logical vertical whitespace, so why shouldn't it be the prototypical vertically white character in a string literal?

[13:57:57] <Altreus> hmm, raku has already rewritten so many things to avoid cross-discipline ambiguity that I'm kind of surprised backslash escapes exist at all in raku regex
[13:58:29] <Altreus> logical newline didn't have to be spelled the same in regex as LF is in strings
[14:02:39] <lizmat> Altreus: well, you could think of them as leftovers from the time that Raku was supposed to be the next Perl
[14:03:38] <Altreus> Not to be unduly critical, but it kinda feels bad that Raku already has historical reasons, and it's not even dry yet

[14:21:47] <Altreus> Yeah, I mean you can't replace everything, and it's only 20 years later when someone in IRC goes "This seems weird" that you get the benefit of hindsight
