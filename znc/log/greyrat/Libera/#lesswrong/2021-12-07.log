[00:54:55] <RiversHaveWings> my roommate goes out sometimes
[00:55:21] <RiversHaveWings> like as early as possible, right when the store opens, so it is as empty as possible
[00:55:43] <RiversHaveWings> also delivery
[00:56:15] <adiabatic> what kind of mask does the roommate wear

[00:56:44] <adiabatic> if you're that worried you should probably wear a well-fitted N100
[00:57:06] <ggreer> some places hate masks with valves
[00:57:48] <adiabatic> the only place I've ever been with valve haters was my eye doctor
[00:58:03] <adiabatic> literally nobody else here gives a shit
[01:00:26] <ggreer> it's funny. the less strict places are about masks, the more cool they are with weird looking masks. the first time I went to the shooting range in camas (pre-vaccine), nobody else had effective masks but they were fine with me and my gf wearing p100 masks. in fact they were super nice
[01:01:00] <RiversHaveWings> i keep trying to get her to just have a bunch of large bags of rice delivered so neither of us have to go out
[01:01:25] <ggreer> how many large bags of rice? and how large?
[01:01:38] <RiversHaveWings> idk like 20lb and a few of them
[01:01:57] <ggreer> who has those besides costco?
[01:02:08] <gwern> walking into a whole foods in february 2020. "no one cared who I was... before I put on the mask"
[01:02:08] <RiversHaveWings> We had them at normal grocery stores growing up?
[01:02:33] <RiversHaveWings> We could just get twice as many 10lb bags if they don't have 20lb.
[01:02:38] <gwern> it's definitely an asian grocery store thing still
[01:02:42] <ggreer> I guess I don't eat enough rice to pay attention to how big the bags are. I usually get a 5lb bag and change up the brand/flavor each time
[01:03:17] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: the asian grocery stores have like... big bags of various nice/flavorful kinds of rice

[01:08:47] <ggreer> RiversHaveWings: if it'll substantially reduce your anxiety, I will load my car up with 60lbs of rice and drop it off at your doorstep. I assume it's around a 30 minute drive each way
[01:09:39] <RiversHaveWings> ggreer: i'll bring it up with her :)
[01:09:57] <ggreer> ok. I assume there will be no contact because I'm unclean. also rice costs like $0 so don't worry about payment

[01:20:20] <ggreer> oh wow. i-5 is closed
[01:20:56] <RiversHaveWings> Yep
[01:21:52] <shawwwn> So the groq chip is actually awesome, and today was the first time that I finally got it.
[01:22:11] <RiversHaveWings> oh?
[01:22:20] <shawwwn> You remember the game Pipe Dream? It was for NES or something. Liquid fills up pipes
[01:22:24] <shawwwn> And you have to route it around
[01:22:41] <shawwwn> Groq chip is like that, but for data
[01:24:22] <shawwwn> I don’t think it will appeal to anyone who just wants to focus on research, at least not yet. But I happen to be a bit burned out on ML, so this was a nice break
[01:25:12] <shawwwn> Think of a groq chip like a city with five buildings. One of the buildings is the ministry of vector matrix multiplication.
[01:25:18] <gwern> really? it sounded like it was a nightmare just getting access to it and even hello world working
[01:25:27] <shawwwn> Another is the ministry of matrix matrix multiplication
[01:25:33] <shawwwn> Another does the transposing
[01:26:36] <shawwwn> If you want to go from one building to the next, you have to walk there. That helps you understand why certain ops can be done at certain times
[01:26:40] <adiabatic> gwern: people started asking me about my Envo N95 and 3M N100 and I thought about that quote and still do
[01:27:17] <CoJaBo> INB4 this just winds up being spacejunk https://i.redd.it/9qdptmrcmx381.jpg
[01:27:17] <Robomot> image/jpeg (1080x1420; 91 KB)
[01:27:21] <shawwwn> You also probably see that while the VxM (vector matrix) building is in use, the MxM (matrix matrix) building can be doing something else
[01:27:43] <shawwwn> That part was pretty simple.
[01:28:30] <shawwwn> What I didn’t get was how to actually use the VxM
[01:29:00] <shawwwn> It turns out that inside the building (VxM chip), there are 16 rooms (ALUs) which do the actual tasks
[01:29:23] <shawwwn> You can select which ALU to use for given ops.
[01:29:47] <shawwwn> But as in real life, to go from one room to another, you have to walk there.
[01:30:13] <shawwwn> That concept was called stream groups, a thoroughly confusing name
[01:30:28] <adiabatic> https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1467971696854327296
[01:30:30] <Robomot> John Regehr (@johnregehr): "this is both a pie chart and a bar graph" (https://nitter.snopyta.org/pic/media%2FFF9Iek_VUAIuuxz.jpg)
[01:30:58] <shawwwn> In the same way that you exit a real world room into a specific hallway, each ALU has access to a specific subset of stream groups
[01:31:28] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:31:47] <shawwwn> By choosing which stream group the operation should flow to, you can route the data (walk around) the building wherever you want
[01:32:57] <shawwwn> Normally, an operation on other chips might require a memory access. Operation results are usually stored back into memory, and then used. Right? Plain old cpu
[01:33:31] <shawwwn> But with this model, the data is in the ALUs, which you have control over. You can route the data around in circles, doing more and more ops 
[01:34:26] <shawwwn> You can also duplicate data (a bit like making a copy of yourself and having your copy enter the building in a different doorway) because in an operation like gelu, it’s more efficient
[01:34:47] <shawwwn> Because a certain part of the computation can proceed without waiting
[01:35:11] <shawwwn> Then you combine the results at the end (DBZ fusion dance) and walk out the door
[01:35:37] <shawwwn> (memory write)
[01:36:19] <shawwwn> So I think I’ll make a visual simulator that literally lets you play with these concepts. I need it for myself.

[06:03:25] <feep> bleh, my bios refuses to be updated :/
[06:03:32] <shawwwn> this was after a five year hiatus of not working at all. prior to that, I'd had a job that turned me into the lovable ball of insanity you're all too familiar with today. https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1392213804684038150
[06:03:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Oh, well, it's simple. What you need is a suitable jar, milk, cream, and plain yogurt. You combine milk and cream (in a proportion depending on how rich you want the final product to be) in the jar, and add a bit of the yogurt (like 1-2 tbsp). Close it, shake it real good to mix, and put in a warm place (in my case, I put them in the oven; I have a gas oven, so that's warm even when I'm not baking anything, and works out
[06:03:43] <Obormot\Arcturus>  perfectly). (Don't apply direct heat, mind you; just, warm place.)
[06:04:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: A day later, take out and put in fridge.
[06:04:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Another day later, you have sour cream.
[06:04:31] <feep> huh. so that`s how that works.
[06:04:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have no idea if that's how it's made commercially, mind you
[06:04:50] <shawwwn> I say that because, if you've never worked a job where if you get fired, someone close to you loses something (emily and I would've had to leave chicago, and she was going to college there at the time) then count yourself lucky
[06:04:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or traditionally, for that matter
[06:05:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> All I know is that this simple procedure results in an excellent product
[06:06:06] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[06:06:08] <shawwwn> I was hopeful that this time would be different, because I was applying to a YC startup, and YC startups want to Get Things Done
[06:06:35] <shawwwn> "finally," I thought, "they'll care about results, not appearances"
[06:07:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, I just opened a fresh jar of this stuff, for my borscht, tried a bit of it straight up, and was *shocked* at how good it is
[06:07:20] <shawwwn> they said ok, we'll either have you work on a zapier integration, help with our CI pipeline, or do a banking project with <founder>
[06:07:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's amazing what adding more fat does for the taste and texture!
[06:08:23] <shawwwn> most of the reason I joined was out of curiosity about working with <founder>. He and I had been friends for a couple years at that point. (He was actually the one who got us our lifesaving ~$20k GCP credits back when we were playing "hot potato" with our training data)
[06:09:03] <shawwwn> in reality, the options were "build A," "build B," "work for bank C"
[06:09:50] <shawwwn> having already worked for two giant banks, I knew enough to avoid them at all costs, until you're about 50+. And then a bank is a wonderful place to work at as a programmer, because you're literally not allowed to do work
[06:10:46] <shawwwn> because each time that anything starts to make even the slightest bit of progress,  it's time to either bring on a committee, or to throw away the plans and do something completely different
[06:11:38] <shawwwn> so after the first couple weeks, it suddenly became clear to me that I was -- somehow -- working at yet another giant bank, for the third time, by extension.
[06:12:09] <shawwwn> because the YC co seemed completely unprepared for just how much not-work is allowed to happen, whenever you work with banks.
[06:12:41] <shawwwn> "endless fields, Neo." There are endless fields of employees at banks
[06:13:18] <shawwwn> imagine something larger than a village but smaller than a city, and then forcing all of its inhabitants to learn something vaguely related to programming
[06:13:25] <shawwwn> and also to work together
[06:13:34] <shawwwn> that is what it's like, inside a big bank.
[06:13:38] <catern> okay so routable was the bank that you got fired from
[06:13:52] <catern> but before that happened you got another job somewhere else?
[06:13:55] <shawwwn> they're not a bank. they're B2B finance.
[06:14:04] <shawwwn> wow, spoiler, jeez.
[06:14:25] <feep> haha, I was like
[06:14:30] <feep> "ah, endless fields, must be routable"
[06:14:36] <shawwwn> lol.
[06:15:07] <shawwwn> but yes. There were a few other mildly amusing points before that
[06:15:56] <shawwwn> one was that they tried to talk me down from $200k to $190k, saying that it's "just north of what they can do." $10k is a rounding error. (Note: if any employer ever does this, it's a red flag. But I was in this for the money, so I didn't mind)
[06:16:35] <shawwwn> I said that I was worth $200k given my experience, and especially my ML background. They said "yes, you're right, you could get more in ML, but" and proceeded to list off a few reasons
[06:17:33] <shawwwn> so my original plan was to get an ML job, and then send them an email like "As per our conversation, you recommended I seek an ML job for a higher rate. They offered me twice as much, so I'll be leaving in two weeks."
[06:18:04] <shawwwn> and then that actually happened, and I was like "well, I guess it's time to go resign..."
[06:18:06] <feep> burning bridges to places you never intend to return to, eh

[06:18:50] <shawwwn> and then realized "wait. Do I actually... have to resign? They seem decently happy with how things are going, and the job consists entirely of waiting for the big bank anyway"
[06:19:06] <catern> where was the other job?

[06:21:22] <shawwwn> I heard it likes that
[06:21:25] <feep> 100%
[06:24:05] <shawwwn> anyway, I met every goal that I was allowed to meet, but missed two meetings. I knew I was done for after that
[06:24:50] <shawwwn> they found themselves in a terrible position, because they really were _not_ prepared for the realities of trying to work with a giant bank, and also were _not_ prepared to burn $200k for the 1 year that it would take

[06:44:40] <feepbot> The Musical Moral of Into The Woods - YouTube
[06:44:45] <gwern> can we ever have true gender equality if men can't lactate?! "is this a weird sex thing?" "don't ask bigoted questions"
[06:44:54] <feep> shawwwn: the BEANS THEME
[06:44:56] <shawwwn> but the line delivered at 2m40s was much funnier https://youtu.be/kqCsQCsinK4?t=138
[06:45:07] <feepbot> Into The Woods - YouTube (Into The Woods In 1989, from Thursday, May 23 to Saturday, May 25 the full original Broadway cast (with the exception of Cindy Robinson as Snow White instead...)
[06:45:08] <feep> that`s just an inherently funny phrase
[06:45:19] <gwern> also, obviously men can lactate, just like they can get pregnant
[06:46:32] <shawwwn> male pregnancy isn't as far off as it seems
[06:46:39] <shawwwn> it's a pretty solvable engineering problem
[06:46:57] <gwern> attaboy, that's the spirit
[06:46:58] <shawwwn> basically a surgically-implanted baby incubator
[06:47:24] <feep> okay, theoretically there`s a bios reset jumper
[06:47:37] <shawwwn> "move fast and break things" -- that startup, probably
[06:47:54] <gwern> "move fast and breed things"
[06:48:10] <shawwwn> technically it's not murder as long as the experiments fail before the 9 month mark
[06:48:48] <shawwwn> I imagine it'll take a *lot* of failed attempts to produce something resembling a normal baby though
[06:49:00] <gwern> the problem is the experiments which don't fail quite enough
[06:49:19] <shawwwn> me_irl
[06:49:35] <shawwwn> which reminds me, I need to get our bucket data transferred to a new account by december 11th
[06:50:12] <shawwwn> at this point it's just comical. no one cares about this 80TB except me
[06:50:15] <feep> cmos.. reset??
[06:50:25] <shawwwn> cmos reset seems like progress
[06:50:48] <feep> well it will be if it stops beeping at me now
[06:51:06] <nshepperd2> trans women could get womb and ovary transplants probably. the only reason they don't is bc no-one really cares
[06:51:14] <feep> yes! looks good
[06:51:25] * feep plugs his second memory bar back in
[06:51:32] <nshepperd2> also the immunosuppresant drugs. also you'd have to have a caesarian to not die
[06:51:43] <gwern> nshepperd2: there's people trying or at least discussing it. it's kinda weird but it impinges on useful stuff like artificial wombs
[06:54:01] <feep> 16gb detected
[06:54:03] <nshepperd2> organoids / 3d printed recellularized ecm wombs would be more useful and also relevant to artificial wombs yeah
[06:54:11] <feep> lemme go through the bios, carefully *not* ticking the option I ticked last time
[06:54:23] <nshepperd2> like if you can just grow the tissue in a bioreactor
[06:56:42] <gwern> like gametogenesis, I suppose. can you use it to make fully-related offspring of gay couples? yeah, sure. hardly seems like in the top 100 list of pressing medical problems, and the consequences of success go *way* beyond making gay couples infertile (bazooka/housefly), but more power to you I guess
[06:58:30] <feep> shawwwn: what timestamp you at? I wanna listen along
[06:58:48] <shawwwn> ooh heck yeah. how about we just restart it together?
[06:58:57] <shawwwn> I wanna see the opening bit again

[07:00:47] <feep> it takes acting skill to be this bitchy
[07:01:20] <feep> his milk :lennyface:
[07:01:46] <feep> kind of low-hanging- omg it's little red, the objectively best character
[07:01:53] <feep> aaaa it's moving so fast!
[07:01:54] <nshepperd2> if you're gonna do ghetto synchronization probably the way is to set the time first then unpause the video exactly on the minute or something
[07:02:12] <feep> nshepperd2: brave to assume our system clocks are synchronized
[07:02:29] <nshepperd2> if you're not using ntp you deserve everything that happens to you

[07:04:21] <feep> little red is like, "into the woods, for the plot to happen"

[07:04:39] <shawwwn> 👏
[07:04:48] <nshepperd2> into the woods, bc thats where the mcguffin is
[07:04:52] <shawwwn> I like how irccloud suggests emojis 
[07:04:55] <shawwwn> but then replaces it with text
[07:04:58] <feep> I mean, definitely
[07:05:03] <shawwwn> but then sends an emoji, but only on my client
[07:05:09] <shawwwn> I assume it said : C L A P : to everyone else
[07:05:21] <feep> nah it sent an emoj
[07:05:22] <shawwwn> meanwhile the rest of the world be like 👏👏👏

[07:05:50] <shawwwn> enter stage right
[07:05:52] <shawwwn> or is it stage left?
[07:06:04] <shawwwn> she even talks like her
[07:06:13] <nshepperd2> i guess if it was just lying on the shelf in your house it wouldn't be a mcguffin would it
[07:06:24] <shawwwn> lol? what's with the announcer literally telling the audience the story?
[07:06:33] <feep> nshepperd2: I mean like... the woods are definitionally where the plot happens
[07:06:36] <gwern> nshepperd2: nah, it could be. like frodo's ring
[07:06:52] <shawwwn> (8m15s if anyone else is syncing)
[07:06:55] <nshepperd2> oh yeah
[07:07:10] <nshepperd2> could be the bad guys are hunting for the mcguffin yeah
[07:07:15] <feep> nshepperd2: you should watch along, into the woods is objectively like the best musical
[07:08:18] <gwern> that's quite a claim. better than _westside story_? better than _cats_? better than... _Hamilton_?
[07:08:24] <feep> sorta yeah
[07:08:57] <nshepperd2> definitely better than those
[07:09:09] <nshepperd2> maybe tied with sweeny todd

[07:09:47] <feep> she's so delightfully petty.

[07:33:21] <gwern> unfortunately, his BIOS started feeping and it screwed with his free time
[07:33:24] <adiabatic> kind of sort of echoing what was said since I wandered away from the computer: I read https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-there-are-6-human-chronotypes-not-just-morning-people-and-night-owls and took away "yes, having massive energy dips between 4 and 7 PM is A Thing™, so don't worry about it; just try to work around it as best you can and maybe take a nap during that time if at all possible"
[07:33:24] <Robomot> There Are 6 Human Chronotypes, Not Just Morning Larks And Night Owls, Study Says ()
[07:35:02] <spxtr> I'm a night owl ("evening type"). I get annoyed that tiredness and need to sleep comes at the time when I am most productive.
[07:35:04] <adiabatic> it's certainly not narcolepsy, but it's still damn annoying to get exhausted midafternoon, catnap in your comfy chair, try to get a real nap, and fail
[07:35:29] <adiabatic> I'm night-owlish too
[07:35:38] <spxtr> Also if you ask me to do anything at all before noon it will be only half of me
[07:36:21] <gwern> (spxtr - 'don't ask me to do anything before noon. afternoons aren't great either. between 4-7PM is right out. and then I have off for the evening.')
[07:37:18] <spxtr> lmao, that's a fair description of my work ethic
[07:38:08] <adiabatic> gwern: yeah, that's part of my problem. I'd like to finish up job shit in the early evening and have the late evening off, but my body would rather almost nap during what'd otherwise be prime work time 
[07:39:03] * gwern puzzles over _91 Days_'s grasp of american geography. so it's a small town outside chicago, and they're fleeing in a car for a day or two, and now they are talking about driving to... 'the ocean'? do they understand how 'continents' work? the pacific, arctic, and atlantic oceans are all like a thousand miles away from them
[07:39:34] <spxtr> you can totally drive to either ocean in a day or two from Chicago
[07:39:45] <spxtr> they'll be long days but that's doable
[07:41:06] <gwern> this is also like 1920 and they're in ye olde time black buggy cars while dodging mafia hunters, so this ain't 'coast to cast with speed radars and urine bottles'
[07:41:06] <spxtr> NY is only a 13 hour drive from chicago
[07:41:16] <spxtr> ah
[07:41:38] <spxtr> I would believe Chicago to NY in a few days, then. West Coast is right out before highways came along
[07:41:42] <gwern> ie freeways won't exist for another 30ish years
[07:41:48] <spxtr> right
[07:41:59] <gwern> one odd thing about _91 days_ is the general absence of trains too
[07:42:32] <gwern> it's just a very weird anime. I think part of why I don't like it is that it falls into a strange uncanny valley of historical drama. it's a jidaigeki very uncomfortably wearing the skin of a mafia movie
[07:43:01] <gwern> I was expecting something more like _Baccano!_, but _Baccano!_ somehow got America in a way that this doesn't
[07:43:10] <gwern> half the time, you can't even tell if you're in america or sicily
[07:43:11] <spxtr> I started watching Arcane. Awkward to admit but it's much better than I expected.
[07:44:14] <spxtr> IIRC Eisenhower went on a coast to coast road trip around the 1920s or so and this experience was part of what lead him to make the freeways
[07:44:43] <spxtr> https://www.history.com/news/the-epic-road-trip-that-inspired-the-interstate-highway-system
[07:44:44] <Robomot> The Epic Road Trip That Inspired the Interstate Highway System - HISTORY (Get the story behind Dwight Eisenhower’s grueling, 62-day cross-country road trip that inspired the creation of the Interstate Highway System.)
[07:46:04] <gwern> yeah, I've read that. so you see why I find it so ahistorical to talk about just driving to 'the ocean' (which one? I still have no idea, presumably the atlantic) 
[07:46:22] <gwern> driving from chicago to the atlantic ocean was something of a feat, and why anyone sane took a train
[07:47:02] <spxtr> I'm sure it's the atlantic. If so then that does seem doable even in 1920.
[07:47:54] <spxtr> It was paved the whole way.
[07:49:14] <spxtr> Err, no. It was *unpaved* from Illinois to SF, unclear if it was paved from NY to Chicago.
[07:50:47] <quanticle> spxtr, gwern: One of the reasons Eisenhower was so enthusiastic about building the interstate highway system is because he led a military convoy from coast to coast by road, before the second world war. It took them more like two weeks and they were a full convoy of more than dozen vehicles.
[07:52:01] <spxtr> I was trying to find out how long it took them to do NY->Chicago
[07:52:17] <spxtr> Presumably that part was much faster than Chicago->SF

Now, officials have pinpointed a cause: a fire at a warehouse that stored beauty and wellness products. South Coast Air Quality Management District, the agency tasked with investigating the foul
[09:26:43] <quanticle> stench, said on Friday that the large warehouse fire, which began on 30 September and took several days to extinguish, caused vast amounts of chemicals to flow into the 15-mile canal. That spurred a die-off of plants living in the waterway, which in turn produced huge amounts of hydrogen sulfide, a flammable and colorless gas that can be harmful to human health."

[09:28:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: I have a comment to link to you, one sec
[09:29:25] <quanticle> Okay, I will give Venkatesh Rao credit for this: he knows and acknowledges that he's bullshitting. I remember namespace, once, tweeted at him saying that "one of my friends" (referring to me) had concluded that he was full of shit, after trying to outline the Gervais Principle series and finding no concrete claims or actual evidence there.
[09:29:28] <quanticle> Rao agreed
[09:30:17] <quanticle> So I guess that's sufficient to move him over from the "stupid" column over to the "evil" column
[09:30:24] <quanticle> How that affects your judgement of him is up to you
[09:30:42] <spxtr> evil people make better friends
[09:32:10] <PapuaHardyNet> oh man, I actually did the same thing as you, I was trying to figure out the Gervais Principle and concluded this is all bullshit
[09:33:14] <quanticle> Okay, but I actually made the outline: https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2016/11/28/rrg-reading-notes.html

[09:33:28] <quanticle> And yeah, my god, I look back on that and I'm *still* mad
[09:33:33] <PapuaHardyNet> Yes, and I've written about 150 flashcards on a mental model related to it
[09:33:40] <quanticle> I want my weekend back Venkatesh!
[09:33:50] <quanticle> You took that from me and I want it back!
[09:34:34] <quanticle> I could have been playing video games!
[09:34:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I truly think there is some truth to what the gervais principle implies!
[09:35:32] <PapuaHardyNet> however, the motte to Rao's bailey is rather deep into the fortress, making reading his works a huge waste of time

If you are a slacker, like me, this post gives our philosophy a name and provides a …)
[09:35:56] <quanticle> I mean, there is a motte and bailey aspect to it. The motte is that business communication very often means something other than what is actually spoken. The bailey is the claim that this 1. represents *all* business communication and 2. that the middle manager participants are unaware of it
[09:37:07] <quanticle> He divides up the world into "clueless", "losers" and "sociopaths", but the more I deal with *actual* middle managers, the less I think the category of "clueless", as he describes it, actually exists.
[09:37:33] <quanticle> It's a caricature of certain aspects of middle management, but it's not really ground-truth reality
[09:38:12] <PapuaHardyNet> replace clueless with "someone who truly believes that what they do is right, and that the company has the best interests of their in mind"
[09:38:27] <PapuaHardyNet> someone who believes in meritocracy
[09:39:19] <quanticle> Yeah, that's what I mean. Approximately *no one* actually believes that. They might have, once upon a time, but the layoffs of the '90s ('92-93 recession) and 2000s (dot-com bust, GFC) have disabused pretty much everyone of that notion.
[09:39:43] <quanticle> People today think, "Yes, of course, the corporation will fulfill its own interests and I will fulfill mine"
[09:40:33] <quanticle> But I guess I know what you're talking about. Every so often I'll read some boomer in the newspaper talking about how people these days have no company loyalty or whatever...
[09:40:56] <quanticle> So the clueless exist... but Rao's diagram has them as the majority of every company
[09:40:59] <quanticle> I don't agree with that
[09:40:59] <adiabatic> well, companies can't afford to be loyal in return, so there
[09:41:03] <PapuaHardyNet> let's dispense with the notion that the three archetypes apply to specific categories of people in the company
[09:41:26] <PapuaHardyNet> we however, can agree that these people exist, and one must deal with them differently than we do with the other types
[09:41:44] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, this is the motte, and makes reading Rao meaningless, I agree
[09:42:23] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: lmao I appreciate the comment. I'm a little confused about that equation though. Slack as defined is not really a distance...
[09:43:07] <spxtr> 1/sqrt(1/x^2 + 1/y^2 + ...) != sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + ...)
[09:43:47] <saturn2> it would be more straightforward to call them "owners" "management" and "workers"
[09:44:48] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: the idea is that the "sociopaths" can be found in the workers, but only temporarily as they ascend to the annals of power

[09:52:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah well that's basically what I said
[09:52:38] <PapuaHardyNet> twisted bilayer graphene experimental stuff sounds about as far away from "I want to hear about this!" as it can be
[09:52:50] <PapuaHardyNet> but uh, I'm glad you are enjoying your time!

[09:53:49] <PapuaHardyNet> well, computer science
[09:53:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... no!!
[09:54:02] <spxtr> PapuaHardyNet: yeah that's usually a bad idea
[09:54:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Grad school for CS is 100% a waste of time
[09:54:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do not do this

[09:54:52] <PapuaHardyNet> well, by grad school I mean a masters
[09:54:59] <spxtr> oh, a masters is much more reasonable
[09:55:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: It's ok, we don't need to understand them, we just need to benefit from the cheap power or space travel or cyber catgirls or w/e that it enables
[09:55:17] <saturn2> yes
[09:55:22] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I did consider a Ph.D., but since everyone is so against it, I'll very much underweigh that option
[09:55:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't do a master's either lol
[09:55:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> (but that's less bad obviously)
[09:56:12] <quanticle> There's one good reason to get a Master's in computer science: you are an immigrant with a baccalaureate degree from a foreign college and you need a US degree for employment.
[09:56:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> True, that is the one good reason
[09:56:51] <PapuaHardyNet> correct. However, I am not looking for a US degree because I very much doubt it is sensible to play the US visa lottery
[09:56:52] <saturn2> it can also be a good idea when there's a horrible recession going on
[09:56:54] <quanticle> I've spoken with many people who're like, "Yeah, well, of course *you* can get away with just a bachelor's. You're a US citizen, with a US degree!"

[12:47:45] <PapuaHardyNet> on that note, I wanted to ask you - because I'm staking my next six months on this - do you have the compute to train large scale language models?

[12:49:13] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao, I think your words are trustworthy
[12:49:40] <PapuaHardyNet> also, you are forgetting, this is for the research project - I still have a job lined up
[12:49:41] <shawwwn> well, I appreciate that, but remember that the most dangerous kind of lie is a truth. I can believe it's true while still leading you down exactly the wrong path for you.
[12:50:39] <shawwwn> sure, but it's your baby. The answer is that you're more than welcome to use our TPUs (lucas still does) and that yes, theoretically, TPUs can train large language models (GPT-J was trained on a v3-256 for a couple months).
[12:50:50] <shawwwn> is this easy? hell. no.
[12:51:09] <shawwwn> kindiana is a genius in the truest sense of the word, and even he just barely managed to pull it off
[12:51:26] <shawwwn> your problem isn't compute. your problem is complexity and scope.
[12:51:41] <PapuaHardyNet> so I'm massively underestimating the difficulty.
[12:51:48] <shawwwn> you have no experience with language model training, but you're, yes, exactly.
[12:51:53] <shawwwn> already worried about compute
[12:52:01] <shawwwn> like
[12:52:17] <shawwwn> I enjoy feeling like I'm at least *somewhat* capable *occasionally*
[12:52:28] <shawwwn> but it still took me nearly a year with gwern to start. making progress
[12:52:39] <shawwwn> and that was screwing with it pretty much all day every day
[12:52:44] <shawwwn> luckily things are a little easier now
[12:52:57] <PapuaHardyNet> compute is the biggest bottleneck. the second biggest bottleneck is my own competence. one by one, mate
[12:53:03] <shawwwn> you don't have to reinvent things from scratch, or base your code off of nshepperd2's (incredible at the time) example
[12:53:48] <shawwwn> I assure you, compute is not a bottleneck. Training 117M is readily doable on almost any GPU
[12:54:10] <PapuaHardyNet> look, best case scenario, I have achieved something great alongside you and nshepperd and gwern and RHW
[12:54:23] <PapuaHardyNet> I think that's worth a pretty damaging downside
[12:54:42] <shawwwn> 117M ended up making this btw https://soundcloud.com/theshawwn/sets/ai-generated-videogame-music so it's mistaken to think that a small model isn't capable

[12:55:49] <PapuaHardyNet> well, that's a really good thing. I can hit my scope for something that I can show as an academic project easy.
[12:56:13] <shawwwn> exactly
[12:56:32] <shawwwn> if you're worried about compute, you're spending time worrying about the wrong things
[12:56:48] <shawwwn> you just need to try to do things. it's as simple and as hard as that
[12:57:10] <shawwwn> and have fun with it, otherwise you'll go crazier than I did
[12:57:23] <PapuaHardyNet> wdym crazy, you don't seem crazy at all
[12:57:36] <PapuaHardyNet> and that's not a compliment
[12:57:49] <shawwwn> (the whole channel right now: "lol")
[12:58:19] <shawwwn> it's a running joke that I'm off my rocker, and it's sometimes hard to disagree. But thank you
[12:58:44] <shawwwn> yes, tensorfork still has access to many large TPU pods
[12:58:50] <shawwwn> and yes, those are plenty big
[12:59:19] <shawwwn> but you shouldn't necessarily try to use TPUs for training language models, *unless* you're going to use GPT-J's battle-ready codebase
[12:59:28] <shawwwn> since it's the only one that works on TPU pods out of the box with minimal hassle
[13:00:12] <shawwwn> what you *probably* want is access to GPUs, so that you can have an easy time using pytorch and such. I have zero experience there, and I personally think it's a terrible idea since GPUs are unlikely to be the future of ML training
[13:00:27] <shawwwn> so I've held my nose around them, and tensorfork doesn't have access to any
[13:00:33] <PapuaHardyNet> I've already written the model in jax lmao
[13:00:40] <shawwwn> oh, good!
[13:00:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm now writing the loss functions and the training loop
[13:01:26] <shawwwn> in that case, yes of course, hop onto any TPU you want. Are you a TPU admin on the gpt-2-15b-project? if so, you can just make TPUs directly
[13:01:38] <PapuaHardyNet> well then, most of my worries are abated, thanks a lot
[13:01:56] <PapuaHardyNet> (am I? idk, I'll wait until aMLPstack runs rock solid locally before requesting a TPU)
[13:02:50] <shawwwn> just so you know, we have essentially infinite TPUs forever. The catch is that you're unlikely to get bigger than a v3-32
[13:02:53] <shawwwn> for extended periods of time
[13:03:13] <shawwwn> also, they're preemptible, which is a pain. You can ask Lucas whether you can use some of the non-preemptible quota when you're ready though
[13:03:40] <shawwwn> what I'm saying is, is that it's probably a mistake to be trying to aim for "rock solid locally" before requesting a TPU
[13:04:08] <shawwwn> I've been running https://blog.gpt4.org/ on a tpu for like 4 months

[13:28:54] <shawwwn> wait, it seems like I'm missing part of the convo, which probably means that the subject is obormot

[13:31:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> wow
[13:31:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is there some convenient combo pill with that formulation?
[13:31:50] <shawwwn> and at the cost of only a tiny amount of liver failure
[13:31:55] <shawwwn> truly a bargain deal
[13:32:24] <dutchie> last time i had severe pain the recommendation was to alternate them at two-hour intervals
[13:32:54] <dutchie> (up to a dosage limit etc etc)
[13:33:34] <shawwwn> yeah. I just have a latent fear of emily. sometimes I think she's ibuprofen-powered, and I know that one of the two is linked with liver problems if you're not careful
[13:33:48] <shawwwn> either acetemenophen or ibuprofen, forget which.
[13:34:20] <shawwwn> but yes, if you actually stop taking them, you'll probably be fine
[13:34:48] <dutchie> yeah, i think they said to stop the alternation after 24-36 hours
[13:34:55] <dutchie> by which time the offending tooth had been removed
[13:35:18] <PapuaHardyNet> lol, did you ignore obormot
[13:36:52] <PapuaHardyNet> but yes, paracetamol + ibuprofen stacks well

[13:40:12] <shawwwn> codeine is really worrisome stuff.
[13:40:41] <shawwwn> it seems like the true gateway drug. so many people start on it and never stop
[13:40:51] <synthmeat> dutchie: yeah, we have locally caffetin, sounds similar. it's really great.
[13:40:56] <shawwwn> addictive too
[13:40:57] <mjr> ibuprofen fucks up your stomach, paracetamol/acetaminophen fucks up your liver, but together they don't fuck them up noticably more than separately, so!
[13:41:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> dutchie: Yeah that's called uh "Tylenol 4" or some such weird name
[13:41:14] <shawwwn> mjr: wait really?
[13:41:25] <shawwwn> oh, "noticeably more"
[13:41:42] <synthmeat> it's what doctors advise instead of ibuprofen 
[13:41:50] <shawwwn> so yes, you can fuck up both your stomach and liver at the same time. a bold strategy

[13:42:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've never had ant stomach issues from NSAIDs
[13:43:04] <mjr> anyway yeah paracetamol is fun in the way that the normal dose is not that far away from a dangerous dose, but if you're careful with the dosing it shouldn't really tax a functional liver too much
[13:43:48] <synthmeat> Obormot\Arcturus: iirc, it's that it degrades you stomach lining over time, so you get ulcers, bleeding, whatnot later

[13:47:01] <mjr> I've heard (which may be an urban legend) that the logic of putting codein and paracetamol together is that then you prevent people from abusing the codein (or they die because of the accompanying paracetamol toxicity if they take too much)
[13:47:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Schedule II, in case anyone doesn't have the Controlled Substances Act memorized, is the same category as *fentanyl*.)

[14:55:10] <PapuaHardyNet> once bitcoin hits the 21 million mark, the only reward that miners get is the transaction fee
[14:55:30] <PapuaHardyNet> which means the transaction fee needs to be high enough to compensate for it
[14:55:34] <kuudes> will it ever hit that? wasn't they supposed to taper it off?
[14:55:38] <PapuaHardyNet> which means the transaction fee will be ridiculous
[14:56:10] <kuudes> why would it be ridiculous? it just needs to compensate for mining
[14:56:11] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: the amount of coinbase transaction (the amount of bitcoin minted in every block which is then given to the miner) is tapered off
[14:56:34] <PapuaHardyNet> not the transaction fee, which is an additional source of revenue and is intended to replace coinbase as the incentive for mining
[14:57:26] <kuudes> I mean, you shouldn't be willing to spend more on mining than you gain from transaction fee, so market defines the transaction fee?
[14:57:34] <kuudes> if fee is too high, people won't be making transactions
[14:57:48] <kuudes> if it is too low, then people won't mine
[14:58:37] <nshepperd> cost of mining is determined by the transaction fee more than the other way around
[14:58:38] <kuudes> there is no intrisic promise that anyone will mine or that anyone will pay for transactions
[14:58:46] <PapuaHardyNet> the more the number of miners together mining, the costlier it is for one miner to mine a block
[14:58:57] <kuudes> well don't mine on deficit?
[14:59:07] <PapuaHardyNet> the higher the transaction fee, the more the miners who want to mine
[14:59:34] <kuudes> and the less people want to pay it
[15:00:04] <PapuaHardyNet> there's the question - does this mean that moving bitcoin around will be so expensive that only nation-states will be able to do this?
[15:00:14] <kuudes> some miners will go bancrupt when they can't recoup their investments, and all is good and well
[15:00:27] <nshepperd> transaction fee is the result of users competing for a fixed amount of space per block
[15:00:34] <PapuaHardyNet> miners can also ignore transactions that do not have a transaction fee high enough for them to want it
[15:00:37] <nshepperd> which doesn't depend on the cost of mining
[15:01:01] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd btw gm
[15:01:10] <kuudes> gm?
[15:01:20] <PapuaHardyNet> good morning
[15:01:30] <nshepperd> heheh
[15:01:37] <nshepperd> hello
[15:01:55] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, the point is this, let's say the last coinbase transaction amount is 0.25 BTC, which comes to around 5k USD, taking a conservative estimate for that time
[15:02:22] <kuudes> you are presuming a constant btc price of transaction. why?
[15:02:28] <PapuaHardyNet> when 21 million bitcoins are mined, the total transaction fee now needs to absorb this amount
[15:02:42] <kuudes> why would the transaction instead be 0.00025 btc?
[15:02:51] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not, I'm literally assuming that the transaction fee blows up, and trying to figure out the consequences
[15:02:51] <kuudes> *wouldn't
[15:03:06] <PapuaHardyNet> okay okay, hold up
[15:03:17] <kuudes> there is nothing to order the transaction fee to be 0.25btc
[15:03:25] <PapuaHardyNet> coinbase transaction is a specific term used for minted coin given to a miner
[15:03:30] <kuudes> it can be 1 satoshi if the market wants it to be so
[15:03:33] <PapuaHardyNet> that is NOT the transaction fee
[15:03:48] <PapuaHardyNet> transaction fee is a separate source of revenue for miners right now
[15:03:58] <PapuaHardyNet> their main source of revenue is the coinbase transaction
[15:04:23] <PapuaHardyNet> every 4 years the amount of bitcoin that is released in a coinbase transaction is halved
[15:04:32] <PapuaHardyNet> this is called the bitcoin halving
[15:04:43] <kuudes> sure?
[15:04:48] <two2thehead> kuudes, what's the tl;dr on the tor link story?
[15:04:50] <PapuaHardyNet> this will continue until 21 million bitcoins are released, and then there will be no more coinbase transactions
[15:05:10] <kuudes> I don't get why you presume people would pay absurd amounts on transaction fees
[15:05:19] <kuudes> two2thehead, I don't know.
[15:05:38] <PapuaHardyNet> the transaction fees will have to absorb the costs of paying off the coinbase transactions
[15:05:42] <two2thehead> alright
[15:06:01] <kuudes> no they don't
[15:06:11] <kuudes> transaction payment can just drop
[15:06:12] <PapuaHardyNet> by paying off I mean, the miners will expect at least X amount to be profitable... hmmm. there's the mistake
[15:06:21] <kuudes> some miners will stop mining
[15:06:25] <kuudes> and some will go bancrupt
[15:06:32] <kuudes> there is no promise mining will be profitable
[15:06:37] <PapuaHardyNet> no wait
[15:06:51] <PapuaHardyNet> every halving, the price of bitcoin also achieves a minimum
[15:06:53] <nshepperd2> (and then the block difficulty will go down, and it will be profitable with less rewards)
[15:07:00] <kuudes> nshepperd2, yes
[15:07:12] <PapuaHardyNet> oh
[15:07:22] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2 that's right, I didn't take that into account
[15:07:47] <PapuaHardyNet> i think this question deserves a much more rigorous answer though
[15:07:50] <nshepperd2> there is no force causing users to pay higher transaction fees dependent on mining difficulty, the causality is entirely the other way
[15:08:17] <PapuaHardyNet> there's one more issue, of course
[15:08:53] <PapuaHardyNet> if the transaction fee is small in btc, say 0.00025 BTC, it may still be immensely costly if the price of BTC is huge
[15:09:24] <nshepperd2> transaction fee isn't set at anything, it's just users competing with each other
[15:09:35] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[15:10:20] <PapuaHardyNet> doesn't this make bitcoin vulnerable to 51% attacks though? if the mining difficulty goes down so much?
[15:10:28] <mjr> it does
[15:16:38] <PapuaHardyNet> so the entire crypto market will implode somewhere around 2100
[15:19:02] <dTal> rather sooner I'd wager
[15:20:34] <PapuaHardyNet> no doubt about that
[15:22:15] <kuudes> there are plenty of people who say crypto should not exist for reason X
[15:22:28] <mjr> wouldn't be too sure. If it's only that people can fork the coin or otherwise do an "update" that fixes things and then some popular variant will take over since people with vested interest will move to it

[20:36:32] <kuudes> is acausal retribution feasible? I am considering that in order to punish our health authorities who want to deny vaccines to residents so that we would donate more of them to poor countries, we should in retribution cancel our national vaccine donations and put the extraneous doses to trash instead of donating them?
[20:38:05] <kuudes> similarly, I feel maybe we should have punished the foreign ministery official who used extraofficial means to hamper finnish nationals families repatriation from kurd's isis prisons, we maybe should have also included the actual terror prisoners to repatriation in order to punish the official by hampering the values they were trying to advance with their extralegal actions
[20:38:24] <kuudes> this is impractical of course
[20:38:55] <kuudes> but like, tit-for-tat in cases where a person misuses their power and does not fear normal punishment for it but is willing to sacrifice themselves; sort of like terrorists
