[00:57:00] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Due to their feeding and breeding habits house flies come into contact with a range of harmful bacteria such as Salmonella and E.coli. Because of this, house flies will often aid the spread of these bacteria passing them onto us by contaminating things, such as food and cooking utensils.

[01:12:11] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[01:12:11] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: How do house flies eat? A house fly will regurgitate digestive juices onto solid foods and these juices break down the food into small pieces, allowing them to use their mouthparts, called proboscis, to drink the meal.
[01:12:59] <zetorian> mmmm yummy
[01:13:03] <mistiry> !flyfact
[01:13:04] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: On average, the life cycle of a house fly only lasts for around 30 days, which means they donâ€™t live for long at all.However, in their short lifetime, they manage to accomplish quite a lot. House flies can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime which are usually in batches of around 75 to 150. So, although they donâ€™t live long, an infestation can quickly arise through new generations.

[09:34:07] <doubletwist> 25yrs of experience as a Sysadmin (Solaris/Linux/VMWare) and we're getting replaced by new hires from India who don't know what 'uptime' is or how 'yum update' works.
[09:40:32] <JollyRgrs> then take this opportunity to get a better job
[09:40:41] <JollyRgrs> maybe even same role, just better company
[09:40:50] <doubletwist> That's the plan
[09:41:27] <JollyRgrs> i got replaced at geek squad with home theater installers and remote support... in like 5 yrs i had already more than tripled my previous salary and had a much happier life
[09:42:09] <JollyRgrs> and btw, i basically manage a team that ppl in india run a lot of stuff for us... it is horrible to deal with (even though some of them are very nice and even know what they are doing)
[09:42:13] <JollyRgrs> it is NOT efficient
[09:42:18] <JollyRgrs> but -----$$$$
[09:42:41] <JollyRgrs> so they hire ppl who know a enough to manage them
[09:43:02] <JollyRgrs> so for a while, i was hand holding them and walking them through exactly what I'm asking them to do... which means I coulda just done it myself, faster
[09:43:21] <JollyRgrs> but we pushed and finally got them to give us someone who knows WTF he's doing... much better... still inefficient, but at least much better

[10:02:37] <xe0n> dont get emotionally attached, it's not your environment, you did your job
[10:02:55] <doubletwist> Don't care about the company or the upper management that thought it was a good idea to replace the entire server, network and PM teams with barely-jr-level guys who only plan to do basic service desk work  which is like 10% of our work
[10:02:59] <xe0n> let it turn into a shitshow if need be, if you're unhappy about the situation at work, you wont be able to change it, so you know what to do...i
[10:03:17] <doubletwist> Just feel bad for my friends who are stuck with the company cutting off it's own feet
[10:03:25] <xe0n> oh well, welcome to business

[10:22:44] <JollyRgrs> sorry, i was playing some RL...
[10:23:03] <JollyRgrs> so yeah, i was going to say... 15 yrs guarantees you are basically working as slave labor
[10:23:57] <JollyRgrs> and i can only half blame upper mgmt for their decisions
[10:24:24] <JollyRgrs> they are promised similar level that they are currently getting, for significantly less pay and not having to deal with turnover and hiring/firing
[10:24:41] <JollyRgrs> they shoulda seen the signs of "it's too good to be true"... but other than that, they get promised the world
[10:25:07] <JollyRgrs> then the MSP delivers the bare minimum... and if they complain, they'll put in some slightly more qualified techs... rinse and repeat until they no longer squeak
[10:25:29] <JollyRgrs> that way they give you the least-best effort that you'll put up with for the price
[10:25:46] <doubletwist> I've stayed that long for a variety of reasons. I wasn't making as much as I could have but I wasn't too woefully underpaid either. I was also home office long before Covid. Up until the last year, I liked the company and I really liked all the people I worked with directly.
[10:26:17] <JollyRgrs> that is a bummer. it is hard to find companies/people that you actually LIKE working for
[10:26:25] <doubletwist> In addition, while we've never been bleeding edge, I always got to work on new things that interested me, and I had very good freedom to build and manage the systems as I saw fit
[10:26:40] <JollyRgrs> problem with my current company now? they pay really well... so finding a new job is really hard b/c no one pays as much

[16:05:33] <monr0e> just that I understand why it exists 
[16:05:47] <monr0e> In all honesty, I am very surprised it took this long to take off
[16:07:23] <monr0e> What I am keen to see is the impact it has on other, FOSS-oriented platforms
[16:07:24] <Kiernian|Work> I'm not. I'm honestly kinda shocked it's gotten as widespread as it has by this point in time. The U.S. lags way behind the rest of the world on the ISP side of things
[16:07:58] <monr0e> eh, maybe. You'd be surprised how bad (comparatively) things are in the UK
[16:07:59] <Kiernian|Work> ALthough, I'm keen to see what else it affects and how as well
[16:08:28] <monr0e> To be honest, covid was a massive test of our internet infrastructure on a global scale. It surprisingly held up fairly ok.
[16:08:40] <CableNinja> Kiernian|Work, like I said, 'minor blip' suddenly leading to thousands or millions unable to send email because
[16:08:49] <CableNinja> all cloud exchange now
[16:09:08] <Kiernian|Work> yeah
[16:09:14] <CableNinja> much like when cloudflare or AWS have an outage and more than half the internet stops working
[16:09:31] <monr0e> Thats my argument too. I hate the fact that cloudflare has such a fucking monopoly
[16:09:40] <CableNinja> yep and the alternatives are shit
[16:09:49] <monr0e> and yet I use the because I can't find another reliable provider that does DNS over SSL
[16:10:12] <shibboleth> https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/-zero-click-hacks-by-nso-group-and-others-growing-in-popularity
[16:10:39] <shibboleth> oh, are zero-click hacks growing in popularity? who knew...
[16:10:52] <Kiernian|Work> I love the idea of secure DNS but I absolutely hate DNS not being on it's own for-that-use-only port
[16:11:00] <monr0e> In other words, social engineering was only ever part of the problem
[16:11:29] <Kiernian|Work> co-opting 443 for DNS is an absolute logistical nightmare
[16:11:32] <Kiernian|Work> for me
[16:11:52] <monr0e> Kiernan|Work: eeeh, maybe. It would fuck up common-or-garden web browsing a bit though. DNS is kinda integral to HTTP in some respects
[16:12:19] <monr0e> I can see it working in a dual-handshake scenario, but then are you not inviting the possibility of a race condition and easy MITM attacks?
[16:12:36] <shibboleth> as with email, running both secure and non-secure services isn't really the best of ideas
[16:12:55] <Kiernian|Work> it works just fine on 53, why couldn't they use a separate port for secure DNS, 453, for example? is there some fundamental I'm missing here?
[16:13:01] <shibboleth> STARTSSL/STARTTLS: TLS if no one upstream decides otherwise
[16:14:11] <csws> You're a dummy if you don't require starttls
[16:14:46] <csws> Also good news my plane didn't crash or get shot down
[16:14:51] <Kiernian|Work> hooray!
[16:15:18] <monr0e> Kiernan|Work: Depends. If your DNS query is separate from your HTTP query in such a manner, I can see it being somewhat easier to redirect HTTP queries without touching DNS, thus obfuscating the attack. Traceroute, for example, wouldn't show such an attack without being adjusted to account for the difference.
[16:15:39] <monr0e> Or perhaps doing both DNS and HTTP
[16:15:43] <monr0e> in one command
[16:16:16] <monr0e> I'm no expert, mind you
[16:16:41] <monr0e> csws: shot down? That's a disturbing possibility
[16:17:06] <Kiernian|Work> hrm, yeah, ok, that's somewhat problematic, but ...yeah, honestly neither am I. I'm just super frustrated that they turned on DNS over 443 on browsers and the DNS filtering I'm required to do is no longer a guarantee
[16:17:44] <monr0e> hmmm
[16:18:02] <shibboleth> it's a mixed bag. it gets harder to block use of alt dns while at the same time allowing https
[16:18:14] <monr0e> perhaps a filter based on target IP with a daily cronjob to update it?

[16:21:28] <Kiernian|Work> it's definitely better than nothing, it's just not as complete as what we had before with all dns over 53 and not what we SHOULD have. It's half-assed.

[16:40:55] <monr0e> No org is going to invest in that sort of equipment. It would be a bit of a legal grey area too, since it would potentially be unsanctioned traffic on an individual's home network
