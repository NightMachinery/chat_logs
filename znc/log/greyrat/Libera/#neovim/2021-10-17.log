[22:40:34] <bfredl> <YorickPeterse[m]> "Specifically disabling the..." <- and you are certain about this? invoking nvim-treesitter with some other module (like text objects) but not highlight doesn't mess with your ftplugins at all?
[22:40:41] <bfredl> but once you enable highlight, it does?

[22:42:13] <syntaxman> Anyone know if there is a source of snippets for the luasnip plugin?
[22:42:34] <p00f[m]> syntaxman: friendly-snippets
[22:42:45] <syntaxman> p00f[m]: thanks!
[22:42:51] <greyrat> I learned vim via vim-tutor and osmosis from the net, and exploring interesting plugins (surround, snipe, etc) on Github. I feel like there should be more to using vim effectively, but I can't find good resources. A lot of resources focus on the setting up plugins and stuff, which is not what I am looking for; I specifically want to learn to use the vim modal editting better. Any suggestions?
[22:42:53] <bfredl> in the builtin code `a.nvim_buf_set_option(self.bufnr, "syntax", "")` exists. in nvim-treesitter/highlight.lua I only see a line to possibly revert that `api.nvim_buf_set_option(bufnr, "syntax", "ON")`
[22:43:03] <p00f[m]> syntaxman: https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets
[22:43:18] <bfredl> not sure how that would affect ftplugins in general, but weirder things have happened in the codebase..
[22:43:19] <YorickPeterse[m]> bfredl: Yes, if I only enable `incremental_selection` for example my ftplugin files are loaded
[22:43:52] <YorickPeterse[m]> `additional_vim_regex_highlighting` has no effect on the issue either
[22:44:13] <YorickPeterse[m]> "Fixing" it involves either disabling the highlight module globally, or just for the file type
[22:44:33] <YorickPeterse[m]> Let me see if I can set up a repro
[22:45:04] <mh72[m]> bfredl, I've been using your nvim-ipy package for years almost daily - fantastic to work with for data analysis (I work in academia). Thanks a lot! Would you know if neovim being able to show images at some point (like emacs) - e.g. for plotting - is something far-fetched or something that could possibly be implemented in one of the guis in the future? I've seen some markdown previews, iTerm / kitty implementations, but nothing close to
[22:45:04] <mh72[m]> something like using emacs-jupyter in Emacs that can plot graphs (e.g. from matplotlib) directly into a buffer. 
[22:45:18] <mh72[m]> Not sure how hard that would be in neovim or if that's even something under consideration for development
[22:46:17] <p00f[m]> yatli was doing something iirc
[22:46:18] <mh72[m]> Been using external solutions like qtconsole for a while but I usually switch to emacs now 
[22:46:34] <mh72[m]> As soon as I need to plot data of any kind
[22:47:12] <bfredl> mh72[m]: there's some work on that by Yatao Li :]
[22:47:18] <bfredl> for graphics in general that is
[22:47:40] <bfredl> it will need some additional work to work as a Jupyter display frontend naturally
[22:48:20] <greyrat> mh72: How do you zoom plots in qtconsole? 
[22:48:38] <greyrat> BTW, do mentions on matrix users work at all?
[22:48:49] <mh72[m]> Amazing. I think it would be such a wonderful feature  particularly for data scientists and the likes
[22:48:49] <Famiu[m]> Question regarding the codebase: Why does `gen_declarations.lua` have basically the same code for parsing C function declarations when it's already in `c_grammar.lua`?
[22:49:06] <p00f[m]> greyrat: yeah, try tagging me
[22:49:13] <greyrat> p00f: hey
[22:49:14] <mh72[m]> greyrat: I only know you can zoom qtconsole in general with Ctrl ++
[22:49:22] <p00f[m]> worked
[22:49:24] <greyrat> mh72: That only zooms text
[22:49:33] <greyrat> p00f: Nice!
[22:49:45] <bfredl> mh72[m]: currently I just have some quick extra mappings to manage external matplotlib windows ðŸ˜…
[22:51:26] <YorickPeterse[m]> bfredl: OK I found the issue
[22:51:54] <bfredl> what is it, then? :)
[22:52:03] <YorickPeterse[m]> if you use `syntax on` or `syntax enable`, `ftplugin` files aren't loaded. If you leave it out entirely, they are
[22:52:35] <YorickPeterse[m]> I used `syntax enable` for years, but when I switched to TS a few months back I had to change it to `syntax on` IIRC to fix double highlights (as dug up from some issue)
[22:52:41] <bfredl> is that for the `additional_vim_regex_highlighting` flag? 
[22:52:49] <YorickPeterse[m]> No, that one doesn't play a role
[22:52:52] <YorickPeterse[m]> let me upload the repro somewhere
[22:53:13] <bfredl> I suspected it because it contained an extra syntax=ON statement..
[22:53:34] <bfredl> and once you nest too much autocmds in vim stuff get tricky
[22:53:43] <bfredl> (where "too much nesting" often is just two)

[23:00:19] <YorickPeterse[m]> bfredl: https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/nvim-treesitter-ftplugin-bug clone this repo, details are in the commit message
[23:00:57] <YorickPeterse[m]> mind you that's for Linux, on macOS you may need a different way to get nvim to use the repo's `nvim` directory as the config directory
[23:01:29] <bfredl> I'm using Linux so it's fine :)
[23:03:11] <bfredl> I'm gonna try to reduce that to just using the builtin `vim.treesitter.highlighter` without using nvim-treesitter at all
[23:03:14] <YorickPeterse[m]> Ah, I think I used `syntax enable` so syntax highlights still work for non tree sitter files
[23:03:42] <bfredl> `syntax enable` and `syntax on` should be equivalent on nvim 0.5 IIRC (at very least it is on master)
[23:04:38] <YorickPeterse[m]> Yeah it seems removing the line no longer messes up non treesitter files
[23:04:40] <bfredl> and not having any syntax command should be equivalent to a `syntax enable` after start up 
[23:07:09] <YorickPeterse[m]> well at least it seems this proves a fix
[23:07:20] <YorickPeterse[m]> and also it seems my English went downhill there
[23:09:23] <YorickPeterse[m]> Thanks for the rubber ducking ðŸ™‚
[23:10:35] <YorickPeterse[m]> Now back to the original yack I was shaving: replacing vsnip with luasnip
[23:13:19] <bfredl> thanks for the bug report (it still is a bug obv even though we have a easy fixaround)
[23:15:46] <YorickPeterse[m]> I can create a proper issue for it if that's easier ðŸ™‚
