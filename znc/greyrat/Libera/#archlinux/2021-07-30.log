[01:44:03] <susi> mongy: same for me, interesting
[01:44:18] <tzcrawford> Is it possible to consistently forward a window on a wayland host through ssh? It works with applications like `xterm`, but I'm not sure that works for windows that were originally designed for wayland. In my case, it appears to just keep spawning on the host's screen.

[01:56:21] <mongy> but service says it's fscked?
[01:57:17] <susi> my own oneshot systemd service also shows 'deactivated succesfully' and inactive (dead), and I'm sure it worked as intended
[01:57:46] <mongy> maybe they changed the service then, so it no longer needs to be 'running' all the time

[08:10:17] <tirnanog> john_rambo: what happened was that the libopenaptx author was trying to get it upstreamed into projects such as pulseadio. relations eventually sourced, with the license being amended to apparently ban freedesktop.org projects from using it. or something like that.

[08:11:24] <tirnanog> john_rambo: libfreeaptx is a fork from before that change. the last I heard was that pipewire just committed support for it. anyway, I can't recommend in good conscience that you uninstall it until the dust has settled and it's know for sure that switching won't be a problem.
[08:11:29] <john_rambo> tirnanog: Okay .... what do you think I should do ?
[08:11:52] <john_rambo> Okay
[08:11:58] <tirnanog> john_rambo: I think you should make a backup of the package that you built (be it with makepkg or some aur helper), at least.
[08:12:01] <tirnanog> just in case.
[08:12:29] <tirnanog> that way, it's only a pacman -U away if switching to an alternative causes some regression for you.
[08:14:09] <john_rambo> tirnanog: I have not any bluetooth related packages from AUR. I have only 3 packages from AUR namely LibreWolf, Brave & Megasync .....So how did this happen in my case ?
[08:14:42] <tirnanog> john_rambo: I don't know. if you didn't install it directly, presumably something you previously installed wanted it at the time.
[08:15:09] <john_rambo> tirnanog: Okay/Thanks
[08:15:52] <tirnanog> john_rambo: you might be able to figure it out retrospectively by reading pacman.log.
[08:16:14] <john_rambo> Okay
[08:17:12] <tirnanog> normally, I'd just say to remove it, but this is a highly valuable library for AptX capable equipment and I'm just not sure how/where/if it's being used on your system. not to mention the ongoing drama.
