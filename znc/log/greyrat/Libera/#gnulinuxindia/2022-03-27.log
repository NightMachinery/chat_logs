[00:00:35] <iamak[m]> How to control entire terminal screen in a program? (Like how `man` does)
[00:01:12] <iamak[m]> Until you press `q`, pressing `up` or `down` will give the scrolling effect
[00:01:16] <iamak[m]> How to do that
[00:01:28] <iamak[m]> And what is it called
[00:01:56] <relejek[m]> for reading purposes 'less' or 'more' command does it.
[00:02:16] <iamak[m]> I was thinking of using it in a program
[00:03:33] <relejek[m]> एके:  well i do it manually (programmatically). i have yet to find a better way
[00:03:44] <iamak[m]> Wdym
[00:05:40] <relejek[m]> eg.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/2915941a9359c55e2a0ab2a8dbb8f7a616d82019)
[00:06:40] <relejek[m]> 'clear' command will well clear your terminal and now it is ready for program I/O
[00:07:31] <iamak[m]> Ah nice maybe I'll try this
[00:07:54] <iamak[m]> But man seems more sophisticated
[00:08:56] <relejek[m]> to me 'man' is super simple. it is other TUIs that seem more complicated.
[00:09:28] <relejek[m]> like vim, emacs, newsboat and such
[00:09:38] <iamak[m]> Oh yes
[00:09:39] <iamak[m]> Lol

[00:09:51] <iamak[m]> I was thinking of examples and I could only remember man
[00:10:01] <iamak[m]> But yes I meant something like vim
[00:11:39] <relejek[m]> yup vim is super complicated from my POV. and i don't know how to do that.
[00:16:35] <iamak[m]> I'll check online
[00:27:48] <relejek[m]> एके:  you there buddy?
[00:28:19] <relejek[m]> check my page now i have removed the JS feature.

[09:42:43] <iamak[m]> <relejek[m]> "check my page now i have removed..." <- Just a sec
[09:43:11] <iamak[m]> Yes visible now
[09:43:23] <iamak[m]> Maybe make the time stamp more readable?
[09:48:13] <relejek[m]> एके:  alright  will work on that. or i should make the the 'twoot' content bold and readable. coz time stamp is just metadata, it isn't supposed to attract attention of the reader.

[09:52:00] <relejek[m]> Arya K:  you get to see my new twoot.txt, presented in html and rss? it is on relejek.ml 
[09:59:57] <AryaK[m]> nice
[10:01:43] <iamak[m]> What is Fediverse?
[10:01:52] <AryaK[m]> activitypub
[10:01:57] <AryaK[m]> mstdn,pleroma
[10:02:01] <AryaK[m]> hostux, misskey
[10:02:09] <AryaK[m]> *hostux is gnu social
[10:02:33] <iamak[m]> Achha
[10:05:05] <relejek[m]> all of the above mentioned social media platform can communicat with each other despite being devloped independently, via the activity-pub protocol. thus all such platform connected with other form a network and that is called ' federated universe' => fediverse.
[10:10:29] <relejek[m]> matrix is also federated in the sense that it can communicate with other self-hosted matrix servers(coz they work on the same protocol) but not other such programs(yet)

[14:46:51] <Prit[m]> Matrix is also 2 level federated as it can bridged to whatsapp telegram etc
[14:47:08] <mxbl> that can be done with any chat service though
[14:48:52] <Prit[m]> But for bridging irc and telegram matrix is def needed
[14:51:15] <somethingmatter> Prit[m]: really? Can't I just bridge tele and irc without any involvement of matrix?
[14:52:14] <mxbl> https://github.com/stevesoltys/telegram-irc
[14:52:39] <mxbl> also that wouldn't really be federated, it would be bridged Prit[m]
