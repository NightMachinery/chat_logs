I discovered matplotlib can automatically save to a .png as well just by adding fig.savefig(filename)! Makes it easy to save a screenshot once it is captured.
[00:26:54] <stewie925> hey guys, I have a question about why the code snippet in https://bpa.st/JKQQ works (question posted there at the top)
[00:26:58] <SnoopJ> Deneb, if this is going to be part of some relatively-long running software, you'll want to be careful about leaving the Figure objects around, the pyplot interface likes to do this. You can either make your own figures with plt.figure() and then their lifetime is controlled by you, or use plt.close()
[00:27:28] <SnoopJ> but if it's just a helper script or something you may not have to worry about

[02:10:30] <SnoopJ> numpy may not be very interesting to a student _learning_ linear algebra, because a lot of what numpy is doing is talking to a Basic Linear Algebra System (BLAS) to *hide* all that stuff
[02:11:01] <SnoopJ> but it's something a student at that level can certainly make use of. If nothing else, it's a good way to check one's work when working through exercises :)

[03:12:59] <SnoopJ> you can certainly "segment" the data into two (or maybe more) distinct states
[03:13:03] <Repiphany> Who gave you this challenge
[03:13:06] <SnoopJ> but knowing which one is "good" is a priori nonsense
[03:13:34] <SnoopJ> it would not be hard to think of cases where you could mark the "vibrating" or "not-vibrating" sections of these traces as the operational state
[03:13:57] <SnoopJ> in other words, there are things that are broken when they're vibrating, and things that are operating as designed if they're vibrating...

[03:16:59] <mattf> First i have to detect uptime and downtime. Then when it is uptime i have to detect changes on the vibration patterns. These are the first two tasks. I guess it is all about data classification. The last one is about identifying possible failures. It actually gives some info about each device like rpm, max temp, max downtime, and if each axis is horizontal, vertical or axial (whatever that would mean)

[07:19:06] <clueful> I have some config files (stored in json or yaml) and I'd like to load them into a dict (easy) and but rather than accessing them with d[key1][key2].., I'd like to be able to access the data as d.key1.key2  just for the convenience of saving on the [""], I know that this isn't possible for all keys (since any hashable element can be a key) but
[07:19:06] <clueful> ideally I'd like it to work like this when its possible (when not I can just use [key]).  I've actually already made this work more or less myself but I was wondering if there was an existing package or standard way of doing this

[16:34:48] <Xano> Good morning! Are there any conditions under which vanilla usage of Pickle will call __init__() during unpickling? The docs are a little unclear on this. I always understood that if __init__() is called, that's because some userland implementation decided to do so for a specific type.
[16:35:29] <nedbat> Xano: afaik, pickle never calls __init__
[16:35:55] <nedbat> water_27300935_: there isn't a built-in like that, but re.finditer could be used to make it.
[16:36:03] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[16:36:48] <Xano> nedbat, Cool. It's "When a class instance is unpickled, its __init__() method is usually not invoked." that made me unsure about this
[16:37:36] <nedbat> water_27300935_: def str_find_all(long, short): return [m.start() for m in re.finditer(re.escape(short), long)]
[16:38:08] <nedbat> Xano: it could be that a user-defined class would invoke __init__ as part of its pickle support functions? i don't know.
[16:38:27] <Xano> nedbat, Yeah that's what I figured. Thanks for confirming :)

[18:38:54] <Speed2u> Using dictionarys to make "translators" to make for e.g a leetspeech-translator, "A": "4", "B": "13"  etc, and then swapping the values and keys to get another dict to do the opposite, i don't really get it to work properly on letters where the "key" is more than one character. Is it possible to solve this in another way? Thanks //newbie

[19:05:56] <bjs> which makes decoding much harder than just looping over the letters, or looping over the keys or anything like that. You have to do some complicated thing that says "well If I used <this> code, then <that> won't decode properly, so it must be <this other> encoding instead" everywhere

[19:06:28] <bjs> Speed2u: well the problem is that your encoded letters are of different lengths, so you have to try group them up in a clever way.
[19:06:58] <Speed2u> or maybe it's possible to solve with something like regex? i've never worked with that so far so not really sure about that at all, just a wild guess
[19:07:00] <bjs> Ontop of that, you have the problem that e.g. "A." is a prefix of "A.." and "0" is a prefix of "0." and so on.  Which means you cannot just see "A." and know it should be Å

[19:10:22] <bjs> Speed2u: if you change your encoding so that no code is a prefix of another (or make them all the same length) then it'll be much simpler and the things you are thinking about would actually work

[23:05:01] <bjs> SamuelMarks: Python syntax calls those compound statements

[23:08:03] <SamuelMarks> hmm
[23:08:18] <bjs> SamuelMarks: here is Python's grammar https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html  notice that `block` is either `NEWLINE INDENT statements DEDENT` or `simple_stmts`.  So the indent is not required but if you do not indent you cannot have other compound statements.
[23:08:50] <SamuelMarks> I'm worried that my design is wrong. I'm trying to device a 1-dimensions array representation of a CST
[23:08:56] <bjs> so `if foo: print(1); print(2); print(3)` is fine as a single line

[23:10:15] <bjs> SamuelMarks: I'm not sure what you mean by embedding

I don't have a windows machine to quickly confirm this either way though :/ anyone have experience using this API on windows?
[23:12:39] <bjs> SamuelMarks: The indents are a red herring, because of e.g. my example above. The grammar is very clear about what things are compound and it's fairly obvious which are the "nested" things in them
[23:12:44] <bjs> so I'm not sure what the question really is
[23:13:39] <SamuelMarks> bjs - I have `FunctionDefinitionStart` do I need a `definitionEnd` attribute to its children nodes or can I disambiguate without that, and without making a multidimensional CST?

[23:14:10] <ChrisWarrick> SamuelMarks: and have you looked at the ast module?

[23:15:14] <SamuelMarks> ChrisWarrick - I am tieing heavily in with the AST module. My CST module is designed to take the modified AST nodes and modifying the original source code without touching the comments or other whitespace (only the changed AST nodes change… and then only `.return` of `FunctionDef` and docstring, `Assign`, and `AnnAssign`
[23:15:59] <SamuelMarks> bjs - Then are indents actually a red herring or are there just two varieties of "indents" I need to consider, and fold them into one?
[23:16:35] <bjs> SamuelMarks: well I presume the missing context here is that you want to make a CST that can distinguish between `if foo: print(1); print(2); print(3)` and `if foo:\n print(1)\n print(2)\n print(3)`

[23:40:17] <SamuelMarks> It's annoying though because before I added support for single line clauses [ nedbat - I'm using the right word now! xdD] the `scope` was correctly resolved for every node

[23:43:49] <jmd> I have a somewhat unusual problem.  I want to run a command, overriding a couple of system calls.  Can anyone think of a way to achieve this?
[23:44:05] <ChrisWarrick> kuahara: the typical libraries for excel stuff are openpyxl and xlsxwriter, you could look into their docs
[23:44:06] <SamuelMarks> bjs ; nedbat - The idea with a one-dimensional [flat list] CST is that I am linking it with the builtin AST and don't want to duplicate the visitor pattern on both, but just want to `for cst_node in cst_list: f = find_in_ast(cst_node, ast_mod)` and then possibly replace that CST value (but not removing/adding any new CST nodes)
[23:44:20] <ChrisWarrick> kuahara: pandas can also export to excel via those libraries
[23:44:23] <SamuelMarks> jmd - monkey patch
[23:44:37] <bjs> jmd: well,  what kind of command and which system calls?
[23:44:48] <nedbat> SamuelMarks: how is a flat CS"T" different than a list of tokens?
[23:44:53] <jmd> time() and getpid()
[23:45:15] <bjs> jmd: the Python functions in the Python stdlib?
[23:45:16] <SamuelMarks> nedbat - So I get a list of tokens from my `cst_scanner` function
[23:45:36] <jmd> Oh.  Sorry.  Wrong channel.
[23:45:41] <bjs> jmd: :)
[23:45:50] <grawity> jmd: does it use libc wrappers (as C programs do), or does it make the syscalls directly (as Golang programs do)?
[23:46:09] <grawity> if it's the former, LD_PRELOAD libfaketime or whatever it's called.
[23:46:33] <SamuelMarks> nedbat - One thing I want to do is have the CST only replace certain types of nodes, specifically: the `.return` of AsyncFunctionDef|FunctionDef, docstrings, Assign|AnnAssign. So it needs to know whats what
[23:46:37] <jmd> grawity: I'll check it out.  Thanks.
[23:47:00] <SamuelMarks> The `scope` is to make sure I am replacing the right thing, since I can't rely on line_no neccessarily
[23:47:09] <bjs> SamuelMarks: this sounds overly complicated.  Wouldn't it be better to just ditch `ast` entirely, and have your own parser that actually parsed everything and produced a tree like normal
[23:47:38] <bjs> (I realise that sounds more complex code, but it's more standard machinery and 'simpler' to understand what it's doing and to make it match the Python syntax)
[23:47:57] <bjs> I mean after all, Python programs aren't flat
[23:48:01] <SamuelMarks> bjs - Tempted to. But currently my whole project is built heavily on the `ast` module, with the idea that Python can evolve without me needing to upgrade my code
[23:48:20] <bjs> SamuelMarks: if Python evolves you're always going to have to upgrade your code.  I mean imagine you wrote this 2 years ago
[23:48:29] <bjs> go and look at the places you talk about 'match' after all

[23:49:38] <kuahara> This Udemy guy:  VB is the outcome of a bad marriage between basic and C
[23:49:41] <bjs> SamuelMarks: what you really want is a syntax tree that has all the stuff in it (from what it sounds like).  Python removes a lot of information during tokenization and parsing (like comments, whitespace and encoding information etc).  A more rich syntax tree could retain all those (With source information)

[23:50:45] <bjs> SamuelMarks: yes but my point was if you wrote this 2 years ago it wouldn't support match (because it didn't exist yet)
[23:50:47] <SamuelMarks> I'm trying to not have a maintenance burden
[23:50:56] <bjs> and since your code mentions match in places,  you'd have to have updated it right?

[23:54:48] <nedbat> SamuelMarks: you said you wanted a flat list so that you could iterate it, is that right? You could have a tree, and also iterate its nodes
[23:54:49] <SamuelMarks> …and I think I'm down to the last problem, resolving the `scope` for each node in the Concrete Syntax List
