[00:32:17] <pyzozord> I just started wondering how does Facebook store it's social graph. Is it possible that is assimple as an array of vertices and array of deges? Theoretically 32 bit integer can hold 4.3 bilion which is half of earths population. So an array that can store 2^64 should be able to keep all verices and another array of 2^64 should be able to store all edges

[00:35:00] <pyzozord> but honestly 2^64 64 bit integers sounds like a lot of space, there must be some kind of chunking going on right? Thay can't just load all of the graph into ram to have O(1) fetch to grab a list of all my friends

[00:43:56] <InPhase> GeDaMo: Not impossible at least.  :)
[00:44:03] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: so that means this should be possible on an average pc to keep 8 bilion people in ram?
[00:44:12] <pulse> how do you search through 64gb fast

[02:32:38] <CoderGuy> how do you um check for race conditions in nodejs?

[02:36:54] <CoderGuy> okay so based on async and how threading works, it's possible that the variable is becoming null without the console.log call, and somehow based on the time it takes to finish console.log it's maintaining the variable
[02:37:20] <CoderGuy> that would explain it, so the goal is to simply not have the variable become null

[10:04:52] <no_gravity> Good Morning!
[10:05:00] <no_gravity> In Javascript, how do you create a function with "f = Function('console.log(123)')" but so that it takes arguments?

[10:06:28] <no_gravity> arahael: I think this is a misunderstanding.
[10:06:43] <no_gravity> PlanckWalk: Well, how can I create a function that takes named arguments?
[10:07:25] <arahael> no_gravity: You can't. Javascript doesn't have named arguments. (But for that reason, where needed, using an object to contain all the 'named arguments' as your sole argument is conventional).

[10:07:45] <|smlckz|> pass an object instead
[10:08:06] <PlanckWalk> Yes, you can define a function f so that you can call it like  f({name1: value1, name2: value2})
[10:08:29] <arahael> Ie, the first argument there is an object. :)
[10:08:33] <PlanckWalk> Right
[10:09:01] <no_gravity> arahael: Well, I don't mean named arguments in that sense. I want the goodl old f(x,y) type of positional arguments that can be accessed via their names in the function.
[10:09:35] <arahael> no_gravity: Javascript does not have named arguments.
[10:09:52] <PlanckWalk> f = (x,y) => function_body_here
[10:10:03] <PlanckWalk> The function body can refer to x and y
[10:10:19] <PlanckWalk> E.g.  f = (x,y) => x+y
[10:10:23] <arahael> Oh, that's what no_gravity meant? Yeah, I already provided that link above, "Arrow functions".
[10:10:40] <PlanckWalk> I don't know for sure that's what no_gravity meant, just a guess
[10:10:50] <|smlckz|> ah no_gravity, use evil eval to create such functions iiuc
[10:10:52] <no_gravity> A guy in #javascript figured it out!
[10:11:16] <no_gravity> addition = Function("a", "b", "return a + b;"); addition(5, 3) // 8 :)
[10:11:38] <|smlckz|> hmm
[10:11:49] <no_gravity> |smlckz|: eval(...) has worse performance impacts than Function(...)()
[10:11:50] <PlanckWalk> But in Javascript, even this can have weird side-effects.
[10:12:09] <PlanckWalk> f([1], 2, "Hello world")  evaluates to  "12"
[10:12:11] <|smlckz|> really? :o
[10:12:52] <PlanckWalk> Because Javascript's typing is incredibly loose
[10:13:07] <|smlckz|> ''worse performance impact''? how much worse?
[10:13:38] <PlanckWalk> |smlckz|: Very very much worse.
[10:13:40] <no_gravity> |smlckz|: That depends on the specific case at hand. But in my tests it was orders of magnitude worse.
[10:13:51] <PlanckWalk> It has to invoke a parser for every call
[10:14:28] <PlanckWalk> Also the side effects are even worse still
[10:15:37] <|smlckz|> you have to invoke the parser for `Function` with string body as well, why so much difference then?
[10:16:04] <PlanckWalk> You don't need to invoke the parser when you call the function

[10:17:32] <PlanckWalk> Yes, there would be
[10:17:42] <no_gravity> At least in some of the tests I did. It is probably very case specific.

[10:21:17] <no_gravity> Just because you *can* interpret microbenchmarks in bad way does not mean they can't be meaningful.

[13:17:34] <arahael> alycidyne: How would a table "share" a schema?
[13:17:55] <deniska> alycidyne: "schema" is a bit of a loaded term
[13:18:16] <deniska> alycidyne: basically "schema" is "what tables are there in a database"
[13:18:36] <alycidyne> arahael: why, multiple tables with different names and different rows, but storing the same columns and explicitly declared to be compatible
[13:18:42] <deniska> some databases support working with multiple schemas at once, then it's kinda akin to a namespace
[13:18:59] <arahael> Some databases support working with mulitple *databases* at once.
[13:19:08] <W> alycidyne, I'm writing an ORM, and in it, *result sets schemas* and *sets of parameters* are mapped to classes, and indeed you have a method returning a list of the record that is mapped from a result set schema
[13:19:09] <alycidyne> deniska: then what's the name for the columns of the rows of a table?
[13:19:26] <alycidyne> deniska: a signature or something?
[13:20:26] <arahael> alycidyne: The problem you're having is that you're assuming that everything in a database can be explained or viewed with using OOP glasses.
[13:20:40] <alycidyne> Or is it what is called the table's relation?
[13:21:08] <deniska> alycidyne: I don't think they have any special name… the collection of columns is a table
[13:21:11] <alycidyne> If so, then just alpha-replace 'schema' with 'relation' in my proposals above

[13:22:29] <W> e.g. `CarHouse=SELECT car.name,car.price,house.name,house.price FROM car CROSS JOIN house WHERE car.price+house.price<:max_sum: AND car.price + :max_difference: < house.price` gets mapped to classes (records) CarHouse and CarHouseParameters, and you can do `List<CarHouse> combos = new CarHouseQuery(connection).list(new CarHouseParameters(200000,10000));`
[13:22:39] <alycidyne> My point is that a table has an associated structure, and *that structure* is what should be mapped to a class, not a table
[13:22:45] <deniska> oh gawd :)
[13:22:50] <W> I am writing this ORM specifically because I think it is a mistake to map tables to classes or vice versa
[13:22:50] <alycidyne> arahael: I've overwhelmingly used Postgres
[13:22:59] <deniska> alycidyne: well, that structure is indeed mapped to a class
[13:23:50] <alycidyne> deniska: yes, ergo, *tables* are individual sequences of instances of the 'associated class', not the class itself
[13:24:13] <alycidyne> and additionally, outside of transient operations, it is misguided to store a row in a variable
[13:24:14] <W> in this case, I am referring to the collection of names and types as a schema; a class is a schema, the column names and types in a result set is a schema
[13:24:32] <arahael> W: Not too bad, you're defining an ORM over SQL expressions, really, and allowing the database system to tell you what the parameters are, which you additionally model as a class.
[13:24:46] <alycidyne> W: that is *exactly* what I was try to express...

[13:25:22] <arahael> W: It's vaguely active-record.
[13:26:14] <W> yeah except active-record wanted to be closer tied to the tables and their schema, and closely tie reading to updating so you can "edit" things easily; which is only one use pattern of SQL, really
[13:27:01] <arahael> W: Yeah, adn that active-record tries to make it easier to do that, by absolutely tying the structs to the database.  Everything has a .save() method and the ORM bleeds right through the application.
[13:27:04] <deniska> alycidyne: so, the major mismatch between OOP and SQL is that in OOP the definition of a class is separable from a collection which stores instances of it. In SQL the structure of a table is always associated with a single collection of rows
[13:27:37] <deniska> alycidyne: so with ORMs you have to invent things like ClassName.all() to invent that collection
[13:29:00] <alycidyne> deniska: I've realized something else: what about mapping views to arrays of rows instead of tables?

[13:38:40] <alycidyne> What I'm trying to express essentially is that it is misguided to store rows as vars: the whole mapping needs to "demote" the object side by one level, with tables/views/whatever being demoted to entities and rows being demoted further to values or something else more appropriate
[13:38:56] <deniska> alycidyne: the goal of ORM is convenience, it's convenient to get ahold a reference to a row represented as an instance of a class, and manipulate it
[13:42:00] <deniska> a class defines a shape of data and a place they are stored in a database, because in a database these are inseperable concepts
[13:42:35] <alycidyne> deniska: well I've found that it's more convenient to treat rows as values rather than entities/objects - when you delete or insert a row, you're actually changing the table, the actual row itself is almost like a constant
[13:43:05] <alycidyne> and "updating" a row can be modeled as just deleting the old row and inserting the same row with one field changed
[13:43:10] <deniska> alycidyne: what type is a row?
[13:43:19] <deniska> how are you suggesting to represent a row?
[13:44:01] <alycidyne> deniska: a row would be just a const struct
[13:44:18] <deniska> alycidyne: what is a `struct`?
[13:45:31] <deniska> Also updating all data in a row or only some columns of a row are different operations as e.g. database triggers can be concerned
[13:46:41] <W> the #1 use of a relational database in the world today is almost undoubtedly the output of `SELECT * FROM table` being fed into a HTML template that iterates the rows and lets you access the row objects' contents by name
[13:47:42] <alycidyne> deniska: I meant 'struct' as in a value of aggregate type with named members, on the object/programmatic side...

[14:57:35] <emperor_time> mrig: Panini was the one who constructed a proper grammar for it. It's not really any special. I don't know much but he used something closer to the Backus-Naur Form and that is why Sanskrit grammar is associated with technical soundness.

[19:34:59] <DPA> In JS, all objects are on the heap and have a gc. When there is no way to access the object, it's freed. This means the stack only ever needs to contain numbers & pointers, and never needs to reference itself.
[19:34:59] <DPA> I can see then, how async / await, generators, asynchronous callbacks, and so on, are possible in JS. Things have a small stack footprint, and moving stuff around on the stack shouldn't cause problems.
[19:34:59] <DPA> However, I wonder, how can things like rust and zig have things like async/await? What if I await something, the function that called me gets continued and finishes, and then I get continued?
[19:34:59] <DPA> How is made sure I don't have a now gone reference to data on the stack, how is fragmentation avoided, and how is memory overhead kept in check? How can this possibly work?

[19:42:01] <jthistle> DPA: as W says, Rust is very specific about who has access to what. If you start some new async code off running, any non-copyable objects that it uses have to be 'moved' into the scope of the async function, from the calling function. This means that they are no longer accessible to the calling function, so if the caller finishes before the async function, then it won't free up the resources
[19:42:03] <jthistle> the async function is using, since it no longer 'owns' them.
[19:42:56] <jthistle> The general rule in Rust being that every object can only have a single owner at any one time.

[20:58:01] <davve> which ties into C pretty well
[20:58:14] <davve> not registers specifically, but bitwise operations 
[20:58:20] <davve> and all that. which exists in way more langauges :P

[20:59:23] <jthistle> goes without saying that C is a beautiful language
[20:59:28] <jthistle> minimalist
[20:59:35] <davve> for good and bad (writing code with undefined behaviour, getting segmentation faults without any knowledge of gdb or the like, was hard, but at the end i learned a lot i feel)
[20:59:51] <davve> yeah
[21:00:21] <jthistle> after having spent a year writing Cpp, C was like a breath of fresh air
[21:02:11] <rbtEngrDude> C is great and was my first lang too, but I stay away from it for anything of reasonable size these days

[21:06:36] <chester> davve: some kid can learn react.js or C# in 3 months (if they're smart) and get a programmers woth of salary these days. I know about programs like that where the consultant company pays for your "education" and then lease you to their customers.
[21:06:46] <chester> davve: they don't need C or C++ at all in cases like that.
[21:07:07] <chester> davve: and I know pleny of people who work with php (which isn't really programming though) for some shit salary.
[21:07:18] <chester> or not shit, but pretty good salary actually.
[21:07:28] <chester> An engineer should know C or C++ though.
[21:07:30] <rbtEngrDude> not sure how php isn't 'real programming', but ok
[21:07:45] <poprocks> learning to pro^H^H^H code because you want to get a job is usually a lot different than learning for learning's sake IME

[21:08:30] <chester> not necessarily at all.

[21:09:06] <chester> poprocks: who do you think the winner will be? The kid taking a 3 months course and earning a nice salary for the rest of his life, or someone who's spending time in their moms basement as a hacker?
[21:09:29] <poprocks> chester: ouch, that hits too close to home lol
[21:09:35] <chester> poprocks: you don't need to learn those things you take for granted in higher level languages
[21:10:25] <poprocks> I never said one does. One may. It depends on the circumstances. I just said C assists in understanding that, which is the case
[21:10:50] <chester> realistically, you may be a swiss army knife, but you'll end up working with only a very few tool in that box.
[21:11:08] <rbtEngrDude> chester has a fair point though. You don't really need to know low level programming to be productive or successful today. I think that's a good thing for our industry, tbh

[22:56:19] <gravypod> rbtEngrDude, this guy was like "unit tests will solve all of our problems". His tests were just making requests to his HTTP routes and not really testing all of the edge cases. Like 5 tests for a codebase of like 3k LOC

[22:57:11] <gravypod> No one thing will save you but if you have good coverage + a few E2E tests + good release process + good QA people you can get pretty tight 
[22:57:26] <rbtEngrDude> yes

[22:59:48] <rbtEngrDude> what you really need to have good confidence is randomization/chaos testing
[23:00:02] <rbtEngrDude> but that's so far beyond what most companies are doing, you almost never see it

[23:01:18] <alycidyne> Isn't chaos engineering just really rigorous simulation?
[23:01:20] <rbtEngrDude> I'm not exactly omniscient tho
[23:01:23] <gravypod> Netflix does stuff like this

[23:06:50] <gravypod> Also, alycidyne, honestly that code wasn't "that bad" because it was really easy to navigate. One thing that happens when you have a LOT of copy/paste is things become consistent. The worst is code bases that have a lot of "look at how smart I am" choices

[23:09:53] <alycidyne> All told, that kind of code must be rare
[23:10:20] <rbtEngrDude> it is
[23:10:42] <rbtEngrDude> because our industry overwhelmingly selects for engineers who are good at trick problems, like inverting binary trees
[23:10:51] <rbtEngrDude> and not people who are good at decomposing problems
[23:10:55] <rbtEngrDude> and organizing their thoughts

[23:11:30] <rbtEngrDude> ironically
[23:11:32] <alycidyne> rbtEngrDude: that right there. Why are people so averse to organizing anything of theirs?
[23:11:41] <gravypod> This was a style he learned from programming mainframes at a previous job so it's not as unique as I'd like 
[23:11:56] <rbtEngrDude> organizing takes thought. it takes time, it takes rewriting, it takes admitting broken assumptions and choices
