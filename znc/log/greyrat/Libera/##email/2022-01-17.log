[10:57:18] <merpaderp> hello email enthusiasts, I am on crusade of setting up an email server with all the bells and whistles, so far I god spf,dkmi,dmarc in order or so I think
[10:57:26] <merpaderp> *got
[10:58:08] <merpaderp> next up is DANE, but that got me thinking of what an actual f is going on with email, why is it not just using trusted CA like any other normal TLS enabled service does
[11:00:58] <jaybe> because email was here before you probably
[11:02:39] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:2b:f4e6:13e8:c8a9:3722)
[11:15:39] <tuxick> CA for what?

[11:16:54] *** Joins: chuck48 (~chuck48@2a03:1b20:9:f011::a04d)
[11:22:42] <merpaderp> CA for STARTTLS I would assume
[11:23:19] <merpaderp> I went out of the way and got Lets Encrypt it for postfix, now I would expect any email client connecting to me only trusting valid certs
[11:23:35] <merpaderp> but looks like the usual business in smtp is to use self signed certs and clients are just ok with that
[11:23:58] <merpaderp> hence why DANE then is bolted on top to prevent some mitm attempts, if anyone cares to validate it
[11:24:30] <merpaderp> but then I need DNSSEC on my DNS which is a side crusade of mine
[11:39:03] <JPT> Just in case: You may want to distinguish between an actual MUA (like Thunderbird, Outlook, ...) talking to you and doing authentication (usually via submission tcp/587) and server to server email delivery via tcp/25 where no authentication happens.
[11:40:13] <JPT> You want to show a good certificate to a MUA, so your client does not throw their credentials at a random machine. But regarding server to server smtp delivery, I guess the most people care about is transport encryption. It's nice to verify your peer certificate, but that's completely optional.

[20:49:28] <ecdhe> any idea where I could get pcaps of various IMAP clients/servers?
[20:59:12] <jaybe> obtain client. use client. obtain capture software. start capture software. use clients. examine capture.
[20:59:26] <jaybe> i'll do it for you for $442 US per hour if desired
[21:02:15] <jaybe> i think lunaphyte is way cheaper  (;p)
[21:03:10] <bremner> I will do it for double that amount, and I promise to use the word enterprise at least once when emailing you the results.
[21:03:31] <lunaphyte> yeah, my price is 0, because i wouldn't do it, because i think this is the wrong way to do this
[21:03:37] <bremner> I guess I should say double that rate, for the pedants
[21:03:43] <lunaphyte> but that's water under the birdge
[21:04:01] <jaybe> i will not accept any bridge water as payment
[21:04:30] <jaybe> s/per hour/per quarter hour/g
[21:05:47] <jaybe> i don't know what 'wrong way to do THIS' is. i don't know what 'this' is. and i don't want to know. either way - that sounds a lot like 'work' to me.  and since i've seen that person request this information repeatedly in numerous channels, it's clear they're lazy and advantageousâ€¦ which i respect when it doesn't affect me.
[21:06:12] <jaybe> i simply responded to the request asked: how to get pcap for various clients.
[21:06:17] <jaybe> that's how.
[21:23:49] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:2b:f4e6:13e8:c8a9:3722)
[22:28:52] <ecdhe> I thought about doing it myself.  Then I found a capture or two.  Mutt was the client in one pcap.  I didn't know if that kind of resource would matter enough to anyone else that there would exist some
[22:29:37] <ecdhe> IMAP captures are kind of personal.  I could ask to crowdsource some from among my technical contacts but the recordings would need to be heavily redacted to be posted public
