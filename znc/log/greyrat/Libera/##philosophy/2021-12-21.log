[00:07:22] <biys> causative_: is there a way we can create categories of understanding with regards to the individually obtainable knowledge?
[00:07:52] <biys> i mean... i agree with what you've said about the potential for information to be unlimited
[00:08:11] <biys> i.e i could contrive something in my mind that you wouldn't/couldn't possibly know
[00:08:47] <causative_> I divide all understanding into two categories:  1. claims about what is actually present, 2. claims about what *would* be present if conditions were different; this second category is called hypothetical or counterfactual reasoning
[00:09:28] <causative_> mathematical claims fall into the second category; we ask "what *would* be true of lines and angles and circles in the Euclidean plane, if the universe was a Euclidean plane?"
[00:09:45] <causative_> claims about works of fiction also fall into the second category
[00:09:52] <biys> okay
[00:10:26] <causative_> e.g. "What kind of hat did Harry Potter wear?" - that's a counterfactual; IF Harry Potter was real, THEN what hat would he wear?
[00:10:39] <biys> i get what you're saying
[00:10:57] <causative_> claims about future plans are also counterfactuals; if I went to the store today instead of tuesday, would I still make my dentist appointment?
[00:11:06] <biys> haha
[00:11:12] <biys> how much do you value your teeth?
[00:11:16] <biys> but yes, i get it
[00:11:35] <causative_> much of the first category can actually be understood as part of the second category
[00:12:33] <causative_> for instance, suppose I'm blind and there's a cube in front of me.  the claim "There's a cube in front of me" can be understood as a counterfactual, about what kind of shapes I would feel if I reached forward
[00:12:58] <causative_> we can actually limit the first category to only current sensory experiences - and everything else about the world, or about imagined worlds, is counterfactual
[00:13:06] <causative_> "counterfactual" does not mean false, by the way
[00:13:18] <causative_> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/counterfactuals/
[00:13:19] <ro-bot-o> [url] Counterfactuals (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) | plato.stanford.edu
[00:14:04] <biys> i get that
[00:14:47] <biys> so is it okay to say that there's many different correct interpretations of the world?
[00:14:57] <biys> or better yet...
[00:15:01] <biys> there is no correct interpretation
[00:15:55] <causative_> well, I believe that there is some actual way that the universe works, that we just don't know (yet)
[00:16:25] <biys> to me it's more so in the evaluation though
[00:16:25] <biys> no?
[00:16:26] <causative_> some fundamental laws of physics that tell you what's going to happen in different physical circumstances
[00:16:51] <biys> if we're saying there's an infinite amount of possibilities based on the infinite amount of potential evaluations
[00:17:01] <causative_> there are - but one of them may be right
[00:17:06] <biys> are you saying there is no more or less accurate way to evaluate the world?
[00:17:09] <biys> aaah
[00:17:11] <biys> okay
[00:17:17] <causative_> and others that are *exactly* equivalent to that one right one, also may be right
[00:17:28] <causative_> our current theories of physics are only *mostly* right
[00:17:50] <causative_> like how describing the earth as a sphere is wrong, but *mostly* right

[00:24:20] <causative_> truth is truth, doesn't matter what color your skin is
[00:24:34] <biys> oh for sure
[00:24:37] <biys> that isn't what i was saying
[00:24:47] <biys> it does become a matter of who's more right though
[00:24:50] <biys> and how we determine that
[00:25:08] <causative_> well I'd advocate elenchus as a specific method
[00:25:25] <biys> i think the valuation is uh...
[00:25:30] <causative_> two people try to work out the network of justifications the other person has, and try to question and refute it if they can, or adopt it if they can't
[00:25:36] <biys> going to be subject to whoever is looking at it
[00:25:41] <biys> and it also leaves the potential for outside influences
[00:26:10] <causative_> but in general the answer is "think long and hard enough at it, with a sincere eye towards the truth, and without ego attachment to any specific idea"
[00:26:22] <biys> where, left just say for example, i have the means to simply have you killed as a result of not agreeing with my evaluation
[00:26:50] <biys> it becomes less of a matter of who is actually right
[00:26:56] <biys> and creates a situation where might is right
[00:27:03] <causative_> yeah, we need to advocate systems that avoid that kind of problem
[00:27:06] <causative_> truth-finding systems
[00:27:38] <biys> and i do agree that this is exactly how things work right now
[00:27:50] <causative_> and we need to recognize signs that a system is failing at honestly seeking the truth, and falling prey to such improper persuasion
[00:28:07] <causative_> well, the modern scientific community is pretty good in most domains at finding truth
[00:28:26] <biys> well.  the problem with that is in the matter of truth
[00:28:38] <causative_> not perfect, and in some domains not good, but we can trust physicists when they tell us what the gravitational constant is
[00:28:54] <causative_> or when they tell us what light does in a certain diffraction grating, etc.
[00:29:01] <biys> until what we thought we knew proves to be false
[00:29:14] <biys> then we're forced to re-evaluate our understanding
[00:29:15] <causative_> https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/09/yay-argument-orientation.html
[00:29:15] <ro-bot-o> [url] Overcoming Bias : Yay Argument Orientation | www.overcomingbias.com
[00:29:21] <biys> at which point we're expected to throw the baby out with the bath water
[00:29:26] <biys> and start anew
[00:29:37] <causative_> what we want to do is not to "be" right, but to develop systems that *tend towards* rightness over time
[00:30:01] <causative_> in these systems we will be wrong a lot - and that's okay.  the important thing is picking ourselves up afterwards and continuing to investigate
[00:30:30] <biys> lets say that the system is developed in such a way as a result of some evaluation that's determined to be incorrect resulting in individuals nearer the top of the heirarchy being expected to re-evaluate their position
[00:30:31] <causative_> not dogmatic insistence, but continual search, with a continual eye to the evidence, not to what other people think or what would win us more social points or what would make us look bad
[00:30:35] <biys> it's likely not going to happen
[00:30:47] <biys> and will likely result in those people, in power, attempting to maintain the system as it is
[00:30:59] <krb> it's still puzzling what set the physics as it is now as well
[00:31:13] <biys> ^
[00:31:14] <biys> or who
[00:31:40] <biys> our evaluation of truth is also going to be associated with the truth as we see it currently
[00:31:42] <causative_> well yes biys if you get into that situation with a few people at the top who have a social interest in not being proved wrong, that's a bad situation
[00:31:54] <causative_> the global scientific community is fortunately not very hierarchical
[00:31:55] <biys> so i don't see how the system could be critical of itself whiles viewing itself through it's own lens
[00:32:11] <causative_> scientists compete on a more or less equal basis to make their views heard
[00:32:39] <causative_> unless they're grad students or postgrads... full professors are more or less equals in the scientific community
[00:32:41] <biys> furthermore, lets assume that the underpinning with the evluation is incorrect in steps prior
[00:33:03] <I_Am_M00t> even the direction research takes is influenced by social norms
[00:33:12] <biys> and we're "working" off an inherently flawed model
[00:33:27] <causative_> the important thing is that you have a system that decides who is right by looking at some evidence external to the social factors, e.g. looking in the microscope
[00:33:30] <biys> this doesn't so much answer questions
[00:33:33] <biys> as simply creates problems
[00:33:36] <biys> as far as i can see
[00:33:59] <causative_> "I say e.coli have tentacles!"  "Well I say they have feathers and I'm much more important than you!" - that's not good.  What's good is, you look in the microscope and see what they have
[00:34:10] <causative_> obtaining evidence external to the social factors
[00:34:17] <I_Am_M00t> what i mean is, social norms determine what to research, not that social norms influence the answers that are found
[00:34:20] <causative_> systems that are more tied to such evidence are more reliable in finding the truth
[00:34:47] <causative_> and we can see that some fields of study are better or worse in that regard
[00:34:55] <I_Am_M00t> say there are 100 facts to discover, the social norms influence which of these 100 are discovered
[00:35:26] <causative_> that is true I_Am_M00t , but we will also have the mavericks who go off their own way and look at something no one else is looking at
[00:35:49] <causative_> and the great thing in science is that if such a maverick makes a real finding supported by proper evidence, it will become known and accepted and the maverick will gain accolades
[00:36:44] <causative_> so science isn't a perfectly uncorrupted means of investigation - more or less depending on the specific field of science - but it's at least aimed in the right general direction

[02:40:46] <causative_> I certainly think my beliefs are accurate, and "the most correct view of the world"; nonetheless I am open to the concept that I am wrong on any given subject, as I often am
[02:40:55] <causative_> there's no inconsistency in both thinking you're right, and accepting you may be wrong
[02:41:35] <causative_> whatever we think, we chose to think that instead of something else - so we must have decided at some point it was the best thing to think at that time

[02:42:41] <I_Am_M00t> to repeat, the issue with relying on science is that science simply doesn't answer many questions, such as social questions
[02:43:16] <causative_> I was continuing the ongoing conversation by saying that processes in the hard sciences tend to be more reliable at tending towards the truth than the soft sciences, because of the greater reliance on external evidence for validation

[02:46:05] <I_Am_M00t> so going back to the actual discussion, you can rely on science to describe a lot of natural phenomena correctly.  But it's difficult to use science to make decisions about society
[02:46:37] *** Quits: allegorical_ (~guest@2607:fea8:33e0:65c:14fc:fa41:f2a6:2a83) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:46:52] <causative_> it's difficult to *find the will* to use science to make decisions about society, because society as a whole is not a great truth-finding system
[02:46:53] <I_Am_M00t> ofc you use science to build machines, there is no other way, but it gets tricky when you think about which cause to allocate resources to
[02:47:11] <causative_> science has a lot to say about how various parts of society could be better organized, but the politicians and the people won't listen
[02:47:14] <I_Am_M00t> a lot of value judgments get involved in the mix
[02:47:35] <causative_> for example, classroom curricula in K-12 are generally not arranged the way the science says students learn best
[02:47:36] <I_Am_M00t> yup causative_ , that's a hurdle that's difficult to cross
[02:47:48] <Ungwelian> Marx & Engels solved the issues already. But there's some implementation lag :F
[02:47:55] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[02:49:11] <I_Am_M00t> the problem is that when you apply scientifically valid ideas to society, you might cause power shifts
[02:49:16] <causative_> economic policy is set based more on what's popular and what greases the pockets of different politicians and their donors, instead of listening to the economists impartially
[02:49:47] <causative_> now economics is not a very reliable science, due to the lack of experimentation, but it's better than politics
[02:55:51] <Ungwelian> I find a good way of arriving at conclusions is asking "is this fair?"
[02:56:10] <Ungwelian> Simply by asking that question, you can arrive at a point where you realize communism is the solution.
[02:56:26] <biys> i think the idea of fair is built on many preconceived notions
[02:56:32] <biys> i don't think you can simply ask "is this fair"
[02:56:35] <biys> it's a bad starting point
[02:57:03] <Ungwelian> You can think those notions through, too.
[02:57:29] <causative_> IMO the word "fair" itself is best understood in terms of what policies are best for society as a whole - for example it is best for society as a whole if criminals are punished and altruists rewarded, because it incentivizes more of the desired behaviors
[02:57:38] <causative_> and so we say it is fair to punish criminals and reward altruists
[02:57:56] <causative_> so you have a kind of circularity if you begin with what's "fair" and from there try to derive the ideal society
[02:58:20] <causative_> it should properly go the other way - start with trying to design the ideal society, and from THAT, we derive what is fair
[02:58:51] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: lol
[02:59:31] <Ungwelian> No causative_, if you define the society before the individual, that's kinda tyrannical.
[02:59:40] <I_Am_M00t> a designed society, hehe :) sounds utopian
[03:00:00] <causative_> that's what politics is all about - designing our society
[03:00:25] <I_Am_M00t> difficult task
[03:00:46] <Ungwelian> Yeah, but you shouldn't do that without forgetting that people > society.
[03:01:21] <I_Am_M00t> I'm not sure I believe in designed societies
[03:01:37] <Ungwelian> I mean, people have needs. Society has rules and customs.
[03:01:41] <I_Am_M00t> hehe, sounds like something Melon Musk wants to do in mars
[03:02:07] <Ungwelian> People should really ask "is this fair?" more about Musk :P
[03:02:14] <causative_> every vote for an elected official is a vote for the designs that official wants to put into effect in your society
[03:02:20] <causative_> we're always designing our society
[03:02:51] <causative_> also called "setting policy"
[03:02:55] <I_Am_M00t> who needs a president when you can have a capitalist emperor
[03:03:08] <I_Am_M00t> :) the algorithm TM decides
[03:03:40] <biys> the idea of fairness seems so weird to me
[03:03:47] <biys> cause it's so general
[03:04:10] <biys> and it is unlikely that the idea would hold up to any level of scrutiny
[03:04:23] <causative_> designing society, and fairness, have something to do with the categorical imperative
[03:04:28] <I_Am_M00t> agreed biys
[03:05:00] <causative_> something is "fair" if, supposing everyone did it, the result for society is beneficial
[03:05:20] <biys> that doesn't necessarily make it "right" though
[03:05:43] <biys> this reminds of me something paul treanor said
[03:05:49] <I_Am_M00t> fair and right are different concepts
[03:06:19] <Ungwelian> For something to be fair, it needs to take individual needs into account.
[03:06:35] <Ungwelian> Like, does Musk _really_ need that one billion?
[03:06:41] <I_Am_M00t> maybe something that perceived as unfair by some, is better  in the long run

[03:08:27] <I_Am_M00t> it's tricky, i guess thinking in terms of end results and then picking which end result you want is another approach
[03:08:27] <Ungwelian> Hoarding.
[03:08:43] <causative_> in terms of hours other people work making fancy food, mansions, yachts for one billionaire, it's not a billion/(min wage) hours of work
[03:08:47] <Ungwelian> Basically Musk is hoarding the dinner of every Vietnamese kid.
[03:09:09] <biys> why is that bad?
[03:09:10] <biys> Ungwelian:
[03:09:28] <Ungwelian> Is that a rhetorical question? :P
[03:09:29] <causative_> no, my point is he's not using up a billion dinners worth of actual labor
[03:09:35] <biys> not at all
[03:09:44] <biys> you're seeming to make a claim about how the world should operate
[03:09:50] <biys> i'm wondering how y ou think you can make that claim
[03:10:08] <Ungwelian> Yes, I claim that Vietnamese kid needs the dinner more than Musk needs to sit on several hundreds of billions.
[03:10:09] <biys> i mean...  the world isn't "fair" by any means
[03:10:16] <biys> why do you believe it ought to be fair?
[03:10:23] <biys> how are you determining this?
[03:10:33] <I_Am_M00t> i think the issue, if it exists, is that the decision making process may not be optimal (for the mission of the company) if power gets too focused on one individual
[03:10:34] <biys> and i don't simply mean with regards to humans
[03:10:41] <biys> i mean with regards to more or less all species
[03:10:44] <biys> it is far frmo "fair"
[03:10:48] <Ungwelian> biys, why do you feed your kids?
[03:11:01] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[03:11:10] <biys> really?
[03:11:12] <biys> my kids?
[03:11:15] <causative_> Ungwelian, the concept is, imagine a billionaire lives the way a middle class person does, using only a middle-class person's amount of housing, food, transportation.  Then the fact that he has a lot of money sitting in the bank isn't taking meals away from anyone.
[03:11:29] <causative_> what matters is the work people do, and have done for them, more than their paper net worth
[03:11:36] <biys> i feed my kids because if my kids aren't fed they wouldn't survive very long
[03:11:46] <Ungwelian> Yes, that's the problem with the Vietnamese kid too.
[03:12:09] <biys> i don't understand
[03:12:22] <biys> how does this equate to the world being fair?
[03:12:23] <I_Am_M00t> Melon Musk wants to eat your dinner
[03:12:28] <causative_> a billionaire doesn't consume a billion dollars of resources - what he has is a billion dollars worth of *power* that he could *potentially* use to make other people do work for him
[03:12:36] <Ungwelian> I_Am_M00t, and the Vietnamese kid's dinner !
[03:12:40] <causative_> if he never actually uses that power, it's as if he never had it - society goes on the same way as if he wasn't there
[03:12:40] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[03:12:49] <I_Am_M00t> he wants to dominate, basically
[03:12:59] <biys> is it fair that a little tree that's growing in the forest doesn't get the necessary light it needs to grow properly?
[03:13:16] <biys> should we make all trees have the necessary amount of light to grow?
[03:13:21] <I_Am_M00t> biys, asking the real questions
[03:13:22] <biys> how about the fish in the ocean
[03:13:25] <Ungwelian> Or more like, Musk wants to keep the dinner in a closet, and sometimes just look at it. The Vietnamese kid is gonna see that Musk has his dinner, too.
[03:13:31] <biys> should we make life fair for all the fish in the oceans?
[03:13:45] <biys> this idea of "fairness" is just so abstract
[03:13:48] <I_Am_M00t> let's eat the rich then :) problem solved
[03:13:55] <Ungwelian> Vehement agreement.
[03:13:57] <I_Am_M00t> is it unfair that we eat the rich?
[03:14:01] <causative_> no it's not like that, musk doesn't have the vietnamese kid's dinner, he just has a piece of paper that says he could employ someone to make a dinner if he wanted
[03:14:01] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i think we should eat the poor ;]
[03:14:10] <causative_> that's not the same as the dinner itself
[03:14:15] <Ungwelian> The rich are porky and make great keto food.
[03:14:25] <biys> I_Am_M00t: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal
[03:14:25] <ro-bot-o> [url] A Modest Proposal - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[03:14:30] <causative_> it's the potential to have work done, not the product of work
[03:14:30] <biys> you ever read the modest proposal?
[03:14:37] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: we can take away all assets of billionaires, then we'll be fine
[03:14:45] <I_Am_M00t> later maybe biys
[03:15:13] <I_Am_M00t> why can't we just grab their assets and use em for good?
[03:15:26] <causative_> what *does* take food out of the vietnamese kid's mouth, is when Musk says to all the farmers and truckers, "work for me in my factory making gaskets."
[03:15:26] <Ungwelian> Yes. Just a bit of nationalizing would make my psychological health rise in spades.
[03:15:36] <biys> Ungwelian: is it unfair that i cut my grass?
[03:15:38] <causative_> now all the farmers and truckers are making gaskets instead of meals for the kid
[03:15:38] <I_Am_M00t> hehe :)
[03:15:46] <biys> i'm not giving that grass the opportunity to grow to it's full potential
[03:15:50] <I_Am_M00t> would it be unfair if we banned billionaires?
[03:15:50] <causative_> society is producing too many gaskets and not enough meals
[03:16:15] <Ungwelian> The best would be to make reality TV of it. Like, march the billionnaires in a room, then take their extra assets. Observe reactions.
[03:16:21] <Ungwelian> I would watch every single episode.
[03:16:21] <I_Am_M00t> is it unfair that a Vietnamese kid has no food?
[03:16:25] <Ungwelian> With rapturous attention.
[03:16:44] <biys> I_Am_M00t: idk.  depends why they have no food.
[03:16:53] <biys> there's lots of things that need to be evaluated
[03:17:00] <biys> i can't just make the claim that no food = unfair
[03:17:03] <biys> that's nonsense
[03:17:15] <Ungwelian> Tell that to your kids.
[03:17:23] <biys> why would i tell that to my kids?
[03:17:28] <Ungwelian> You'll save in grocery costs.
[03:17:41] <Ungwelian> The little runts will learn that no food doesn't mean it's unfair for them.
[03:17:44] <I_Am_M00t> biys: i can't just make the claim that no billionaires is unfair
[03:18:27] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, it's not all about fairness i guess
[03:18:28] <biys> this conversation is more or less nonsense now
[03:18:39] <biys> it's based on many preconceived notions about how you're supposing the world ought to be
[03:18:44] <biys> isntead of how the world actually is
[03:18:53] <biys> the world is not fair
[03:18:55] <Ungwelian> The Vietnamese kid is supposed to have dinner.
[03:19:01] <biys> "supposed"
[03:19:04] <biys> according to who?
[03:19:07] <biys> according to what?
[03:19:12] <I_Am_M00t> why biys ? you said it doesn't make sense to just claim starvation is unfair. I'm making a similar statement about economic goals
[03:19:12] <biys> show me the contract with the universe

[03:19:44] <I_Am_M00t> let's illegalize high concentrations of power, why not?
[03:19:50] <causative_> the world is not fair, but people who say "the world is not fair" often do so because there is some specific unfairness that they are okay with
[03:19:53] <causative_> and that's not right
[03:19:59] <causative_> the world isn't fair and we ought to try to make it more fair
[03:20:19] <biys> how would the world work if things were fair?  is the tiger that eats the gazelle... is that "fair" ?
[03:20:40] <biys> is the cat that eats the mouse... fair?
[03:20:40] <I_Am_M00t> the world is not fair, so if power shifts happen in society due to policy changes, the  so be it
[03:20:57] <biys> is the tree that doesn't grow because it's seed landed in rock instead of soil "fair" ?
[03:20:57] <causative_> it would be like seeing a serial killer stabbing people and just shrugging it off saying "the world kills people." Yes it does... but we shouldn't like that it does, we should work to try to stop that, stop that guy.
[03:20:58] <Ungwelian> The world would work much better. Let me recommend a book to you, biys, in turn.
[03:21:05] <I_Am_M00t> no biys , it's probably not about fairness at all
[03:21:18] <biys> it isn't about fairness
[03:21:25] <biys> which is why it's kind of a silly conversation
[03:21:25] <I_Am_M00t> it's just an emotional term perhaps, that needs to be better explained
[03:21:29] <causative_> biys, the concept of fairness only really applies in human society
[03:21:35] <I_Am_M00t> yeah biys , I agree
[03:21:37] <causative_> to apply it to trees or animals is a stretch
[03:21:50] <biys> causative_: it's the idea that the world is supposed to be fair
[03:21:56] <causative_> a child with a great deal of potential who was denied food and education and made to work in a sweatshop - that's not fair
[03:21:59] <biys> and i'm asking where this idea, that the world is supposed to be fair, comes from
[03:22:05] <biys> it's fiction
[03:22:06] <I_Am_M00t> agreed completely biys
[03:22:13] <I_Am_M00t> it needs to be rethought
[03:22:18] <causative_> it's not fiction, it's an aspiration
[03:22:28] <causative_> we want the world to be fair because fairness means society works well and we want society to work well
[03:22:42] <biys> i'll make sure to gather up all the seeds that fall from trees and give them equal opportunity
[03:22:45] <biys> hah
[03:22:50] <causative_> we don't want to squander the potential of children by starving them
[03:22:54] <causative_> that harms society
[03:23:06] <causative_> and we want to help society, so we call that unfair and work to prevent it
[03:23:10] <I_Am_M00t> let's say someone created a trillion dollar company, and people forcefully take it over. I don't think you can simply say that is wrong
[03:23:20] <Ungwelian> Here: https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/
[03:23:21] <ro-bot-o> [url] Economic Manuscripts: Capital: Volume One | www.marxists.org
[03:23:32] <Ungwelian> Waddle through that. Then the other parts.
[03:23:48] <biys> and what am i supposed to gleem from this Ungwelian ?
[03:23:51] <causative_> the world is often very unfair, but it is *good* when it is fair
[03:23:53] <Ungwelian> And then proceed to Lenin's "What is to be done?"
[03:23:58] <causative_> so don't use that as an excuse
[03:24:16] <causative_> "oh, you're freezing to death?  well the universe on average is 2.3 degrees Kelvin so suck it up."
[03:24:27] <biys> causative_: if a seed from a plant falls on rock instead of in soil, and that plant isn't afforded the "right" to grow... is that fair?
[03:24:51] <biys> nothing in the world is "fair"
[03:24:51] <causative_> <causative_> biys, the concept of fairness only really applies in human society
[03:24:57] <biys> it doesn't though
[03:25:00] <biys> you can say it does
[03:25:02] <biys> but it doesn't
[03:25:02] <causative_> <causative_> to apply it to trees or animals is a stretch
[03:25:17] <I_Am_M00t> biys:  if people forcefully take a trillion dollar company over, I don't think you can simply say that is wrong
[03:25:40] <I_Am_M00t> I think by some logic it can be good
[03:26:01] <biys> i'm not saying it might not be admirable in some form or another to promote some form of just society
[03:26:10] *** Joins: qu4nt1n (~qu4nt1n@78.198.214.34)
[03:26:10] <biys> but i don't think we can make any claim that things are SUPPSOED to be fair
[03:26:16] <biys> there is no contract with the universe
[03:26:19] <I_Am_M00t> :)
[03:26:20] <Ungwelian> The kid is supposed to eat.
[03:26:29] <I_Am_M00t> no Ungwelian , i agree with him
[03:26:35] * Ungwelian hisses
[03:26:47] <I_Am_M00t> but let's see how that logic applies when it's turned the other way
[03:27:07] <biys> show me where the world is "fair"
[03:27:15] <biys> any circumstance where the world is "fair"
[03:27:34] <I_Am_M00t> biys: if people forcefully take a trillion dollar company over, I don't think you can simply say that is wrong
[03:27:57] <I_Am_M00t> nobody said that the company has to remain in the hands of its owner
[03:28:14] <biys> that is correct.
[03:28:25] <biys> it happened time and time again throughout history
[03:28:32] <I_Am_M00t> it might happen again
[03:28:41] <causative_>  it's fair when kids get what they need to thrive
[03:28:44] <causative_> that happens sometimes
[03:28:46] <biys> it more than likely will happen again
[03:28:52] <causative_> it's fair when a man commits a crime and is punished for it
[03:29:05] <I_Am_M00t> is it really causative_ ?
[03:29:12] <I_Am_M00t> what if the legal system is unfair?
[03:29:13] <causative_> it's fair when a man feeds the hungry and is rewarded for it
[03:29:20] <causative_> well, if it's a bad crime I_Am_M00t
[03:29:25] *** Quits: qu4nt1n (~qu4nt1n@78.198.214.34) (Client Quit)
[03:29:32] <causative_> e.g. if he killed somebody so he goes to prison, that's fair
[03:29:32] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but that's a value judgment?
[03:29:36] <I_Am_M00t> what is "bad"?
[03:29:38] <biys> was the OJ Simpson trial "fair" ?
[03:30:00] *** Joins: bittersweetsymph (uid509475@id-509475.lymington.irccloud.com)
[03:30:15] <causative_> when I say "bad" here I am speaking of crimes such that it is beneficial to society as a whole if we ban those crimes and punish people for them
[03:30:24] <causative_> it's fair to be punished for such a crime
[03:30:34] <I_Am_M00t> ok causative_ , fair enough
[03:30:40] <biys> your preconceived notions about how the world ought to work are lost on me
[03:31:05] <biys> because it's not based in any kind of reality what-so-ever
[03:31:06] <I_Am_M00t> but how do you conclude what's good and bad, at some point there's a value judgment being made? (that isn't necessarily logical)
[03:31:27] <causative_> well that depends on what you think is beneficial or harmful to society as a whole
[03:31:39] <biys> everywhere i look i see some form of "harm" that is being inflicted
[03:31:47] <biys> and it  isn't simply human on human
[03:31:55] <causative_> myself I think it is good when we take actions that tend towards greater truth-seeking
[03:31:57] <biys> is a tornado "fair" ?
[03:31:59] <causative_> as a society
[03:32:01] <I_Am_M00t> "what you think" and there lies the risk of making judgments that aren't necessarily justified by logic
[03:32:03] <biys> is a tsunami "fair" ?
[03:32:05] <causative_> truth-seeking is the highest good
[03:32:11] <biys> is an eathquake "fair" ?
[03:32:17] <I_Am_M00t> hehe
[03:32:38] <causative_> to support truth-seeking we need the people to be comfortable and healthy, we need speech to be free, we need the people to have the spare time to pursue the truth
[03:32:51] <biys> "need"
[03:32:51] <causative_> we need technological advance and better education
[03:32:55] <I_Am_M00t> if i punch an old man in the gut, and steal their last apple, is that unfair?
[03:33:06] <biys> assuming that truth-seeking is a goal that is necessary
[03:33:09] <causative_> this is an instrumental notion of "need" biys  - I am just saying that goal A is useful for the fulfillment of goal B
[03:33:12] <biys> again, preconceived notion
[03:33:23] <biys> what if truth-seeking is technically the last thing we "need"
[03:33:40] <causative_> well, I think truth-seeking is the highest moral good for a variety of reasons
[03:33:44] <biys> this is so full of declarative sentiments based on nothign more than fiction
[03:33:48] <biys> show me the contract with the universe
[03:33:52] <I_Am_M00t> agreed biys
[03:34:22] <causative_> anyway, you are free to choose other notions of societal good
[03:34:27] <I_Am_M00t> why are laws needed? who said they are?
[03:34:31] <causative_> I don't feel like laying out my case for "truth-seeking" right now
[03:34:35] <I_Am_M00t> why is the social good, good?
[03:34:52] <causative_> but if you pick something else for societal good - e.g. some combination measure of health, happiness, economic productivity, and free time
[03:35:04] <causative_> then you reach similar conclusions about what laws are good
[03:35:14] <causative_> unless your measure is very different from mine
[03:35:19] <Ungwelian> There's two things to be considered: responsibility and consequences.
[03:35:32] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: fair enough
[03:36:06] <biys> i can agree that a just society is more than likely the best way to operate.  i wouldn't go as far as to say it's the "only" way to operate
[03:36:11] <biys> there is likely other models that work just as well
[03:36:26] <causative_> define "work just as well" biys
[03:36:26] <Ungwelian> For example in the case of murder, did the murderer have the time and the means to think it through?
[03:36:34] <biys> causative_: depends what the end-goal is
[03:36:38] <causative_> when does a model "work" and when does it not "work" biys ? sounds like you're talking about which models lead to societal welfare
[03:36:40] <causative_> same as I am
[03:36:50] <Ungwelian> And also in the case of murder, what are the consequences for the murdered?
[03:36:51] <causative_> yeah sure, "end-goal," same concept
[03:36:57] <biys> yes yes,  this was simply int he context of social welfare
[03:36:58] <biys> yes
[03:37:13] <I_Am_M00t> why is murder bad? is a way to put focus on the issue
[03:37:27] <Ungwelian> Elon Musk, for example, has the time and the means to think about the Vietnamese kid.
[03:37:35] <Ungwelian> He also has the means to feed the kid.
[03:37:35] <causative_> murder is bad because it extinguishes the truths that the murdered sentient being kept in his mind
[03:37:48] <biys> i don't think murder is inherently bad.  tbh
[03:37:52] <I_Am_M00t> "why should people not be allowed to murder?", essentially is this whole inquiry
[03:37:59] <causative_> sapience is what grants lives moral value
[03:38:13] <causative_> it's why humans are more valuable, morally speaking, than slugs or anteaters
[03:38:13] <biys> as we move through time and space it could be determined that the "murder" was actually a positive thing
[03:38:25] <causative_> and sapience is simply the capacity to truth-seek
[03:38:26] <I_Am_M00t> biys: why is murder of a completely innocent person bad, is what i mean
[03:38:52] <biys> the person could be innocent.  lets say that their offspring ends up being polpot 2.0
[03:38:54] <I_Am_M00t> that's what i think this all comes down to, and it's a bit much
[03:39:36] <biys> we can't make any claim about something like that that transcend time and space
[03:39:42] <Ungwelian> UNUDHR begins by:
[03:39:44] <biys> what is "good" today could be "bad" tomorrow
[03:39:44] <Ungwelian> "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."
[03:39:49] <I_Am_M00t> biys: i don't mean im moral dilemmas, i mean doing it for no reason, line you would eat a peanut
[03:40:04] <I_Am_M00t> like you would eat a peanut
[03:40:16] <I_Am_M00t> that puts the issue in focus a  bit more
[03:40:41] <Ungwelian> I think that's a ground for fairness. That people are, commonly, born with similar needs and means.
[03:41:01] <Ungwelian> After that comes social stratification.
[03:41:07] <Ungwelian> And Elon Musk.
[03:41:41] <biys> Ungwelian: the united nations declaration isn't a contract with the universe though
[03:41:51] <biys> i can declare!!! that you owe me $1,000,000
[03:41:53] <biys> it means nothing
[03:42:20] <I_Am_M00t> biys: why is cold blooded, sporadic murder bad?
[03:42:30] <I_Am_M00t> forget moral dilemmas
[03:42:34] <biys> i don't think it is necessarily
[03:42:39] <causative_> the concept of a "contract" is something just as invented as the concept of "fairness" biys
[03:42:51] <biys> causative_: i understand
[03:43:06] <causative_> humans make up these concepts and just because we made them up, doesn't mean they are meaningless
[03:43:13] <causative_> they have meaning because they have meaning to us
[03:43:13] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but are you thinking of moral dilemmas now, or are you considering the case when there is no justification other than "I felt like it"? biys
[03:44:40] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i would say that it is bad as a result of removing ones liberty.  i wouldn't make any claim to it's impact on the universe.

[03:45:29] <biys> but that's about as far as that goes
[03:45:42] <I_Am_M00t> ok
[03:45:47] <biys> the world will keep spinning
[03:45:48] <Ungwelian> Empathy level 100.
[03:45:56] <biys> time will continue to pass
[03:46:11] <I_Am_M00t> biys: ok, but basically, we can just remove all laws
[03:46:16] <I_Am_M00t> the world will keep spinning
[03:46:17] <biys> it could end up that in 1,000,000 years we find out that the result of that death was, infact, GOOD!
[03:46:23] <biys> in which case future-us would rejoice
[03:46:27] <biys> and mark it down on a calendar
[03:46:30] <biys> and celebrate it
[03:46:48] <I_Am_M00t> haha, i mean, for nature it might be good if people cease to exist
[03:46:54] *** Joins: grimvar (~grimvar@i5C75F749.versanet.de)
[03:47:13] <causative_> it could be biys but we don't know either way
[03:47:28] <Ungwelian> That sounds like grasping on straws. Like, you shouldn't make rational choices now, because in the future everything might somehow be different for unknown reasons.
[03:47:37] <I_Am_M00t> this is very deep stuff biys is expressing imo
[03:47:39] <causative_> we have no reason to believe the ultra-long-term effect of that death would be good or bad, so we can only look at the short to medium term effect of it
[03:47:58] <biys> i need to make rational choices now for the betterment of my life.  which i can classify, myself, as being good or bad
[03:48:00] <I_Am_M00t> all bad things can be good
[03:48:15] <biys> that doesn't mean that they are universally good or bad
[03:48:17] <causative_> a butterfly flaps its wings and causes a hurricane - but this doesn't mean we should kill all the butterflies, because a butterfly could just as easily flap its wings and prevent the hurricane, and we don't know which flap is which
[03:48:21] <biys> specially as they transcend time and space
[03:48:39] <I_Am_M00t> wow, I've never thought of it that way
[03:48:50] <biys> it could end up that me being 100% altruistic and giving away all my posessions ends up benfitting the next polpot 2.0
[03:48:59] <biys> in which case, as we view it in the future, my altruism was"bad"
[03:49:05] <biys> at the time it was considered good though
[03:49:20] <I_Am_M00t> :) true
[03:50:59] <biys> it just depends frmo which lens you wanna view it
[03:51:00] <biys> IMO
[03:51:12] <biys> if i murder someone and take their millions.  it's "good" for me
[03:51:16] <biys> it's "bad" for them
[03:51:40] <biys> if it ends up that we find out, somewhere down the line, that the person i murdered was a jeffry epstein, i could very well be celebrated
[03:51:54] <biys> likely not celebrated by the "victims" family, however
[03:52:24] <biys> celebrated by HIS victims
[03:52:51] <I_Am_M00t> so let's all get vaccinated? i mean, it could be that a demon from hell might arrive otherwise. Maybe the demonic portal requires that a specific person isn't vaccinated, and since we don't know who it is, we have to vaccinate everyone.
[03:53:14] <biys> haha
[03:53:14] <I_Am_M00t> who knows, the future is unclear
[03:53:28] <biys> i think we can somewhat understand where we're going and what we're doing
[03:53:37] <biys> but there is error in that speculation
[03:53:40] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think so
[03:54:17] <Ungwelian> I'm all for promoting demonology as the cause for vaccination.
[03:54:28] <biys> as i said to causative_ last week
[03:54:33] <biys> women getting the vote caused covid
[03:54:38] <I_Am_M00t> what if what you perceive to be a small possibility of error is actually opens a gate to a evil hyperdimensional monster?
[03:54:40] <biys> and i'll stand beside that all day long
[03:54:49] <I_Am_M00t> -is
[03:54:49] <biys> on that note i'm going to order pizza and feed the kids
[03:55:13] <Ungwelian> Demonology needs to be included more and it has great market value. It might lead to vastly more vaccinations too.
[03:55:13] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[03:55:29] <I_Am_M00t> biys: the pizza you eat, maybe it's better you dont?
[03:55:30] <Ungwelian> But is it fair to feed the kids??
[03:55:34] <causative_> "we don't know the full consequences of our actions out to infinity so I'm going to ignore right and wrong and just do whatever I want."
[03:55:40] <I_Am_M00t> it might cause a butterfly effect and cause a worldwar
[03:56:03] <biys> causative_: i can't really do what i want though
[03:56:17] <Ungwelian> If I fart in the wind, it might cause a zen master to clap with one hand in Novosibirsk.
[03:56:32] <I_Am_M00t> it might indeed
[03:57:06] <biys> if i poop on the ground it might grow the next plant that cures cancer
[03:57:08] <biys> *shrug*
[03:57:10] <Ungwelian> AFTER which the zen master opens an interdimensional portal and calls a demon who eats all the unvaccinated.
[03:57:13] <biys> okay bbl
[03:57:35] <I_Am_M00t> yesterday i was walking down the street and i walked by a stranger, what if he was the next Lucifer? i should maybe have done something
[03:57:46] <I_Am_M00t> biys: dont eat the pizza
[03:57:54] <I_Am_M00t> ffs it's dangerous
[03:58:12] <I_Am_M00t> is this philosophy? hehe
[04:00:04] <Ungwelian> I'd classify it more as Elon Musk once again managing a Chewbacca defense :P
[04:00:18] <Ungwelian> The Vietnamese kid won't get his dinner today.
[04:03:01] <I_Am_M00t> i read something about anti-choicers saying that their doctor would go to hell, while they were asking them to perform an abortion
[04:03:25] <I_Am_M00t> idk if it's true, but it seems plausible
[04:04:51] <Ungwelian> I don't doubt it.

[04:11:24] <Ungwelian> You'd be this liminal mother-to-be, carrying endless, precious, godly potential.
[04:11:29] <sweetsymphony> people not make sure pregnant women are taken care of. On a hypothetical level, in front of others/for likes on social media they do. In reality the government lets pregnant women try to survive long periods without income before they can help them, some survive somehow, some go homeless in their cars, some end up on the sidewalk with a sign begging for help while most walk past. I have seen/experienced this in my life
[04:12:10] <sweetsymphony> in Australia
[04:12:35] <Ungwelian> Yeah, that's true of course.
[04:13:28] <sweetsymphony> I do not live in the big city any more though, so I don't know how many people sill sit on the sidewalk in with their signs and appeals for help.
[04:13:37] <sweetsymphony> s/sill/still
[04:13:37] <ro-bot-o> sweetsymphony meant to say: I do not live in the big city any more though, so I don't know how many people still sit on the sidewalk in with their signs and appeals for help.
[04:25:59] <causative_> if you are in favor of legal abortions, then you need a moral theory of why you think it is okay to kill the fetus
[04:26:08] <causative_> why it isn't murder
[04:26:34] <causative_> what I say is, the fetus is not sapient - it's not intelligent like a human yet, so to kill it is no worse than killing, say, a goldfish
[04:26:52] <sweetsymphony> people imagine people helping pregnant women or single mothers a lot but i think the stigma and hate against them far outweighs the compassion and there is not really much help at all for them
[04:26:57] <causative_> because I say morality is based in sapience - in the ability to seek truth - because truth-seeking is the highest moral good
[04:27:10] <causative_> beings have moral value in proportion to their ability to seek truth
[04:27:12] <I_Am_M00t> what if the fetus contains an intermediary soul which turns demonic of you kill it
[04:27:24] <I_Am_M00t> if you*
[04:30:00] <sweetsymphony> sort of one reason to not want to get into a relationship because if for whatever reason you end up on your own pregnant or with kids extremely difficult and extreme stigma
[04:31:23] <sweetsymphony> I wouldn't have an abortion but i understand why women do i think
[04:32:33] <sweetsymphony> they have to be ready to walk into fire or something in some circumstances and if they don't think they are...well
[04:32:55] <sweetsymphony> i tip my hat to women who knows they are going to go homeless in their car and keep the baby anyway

[04:39:37] <sweetsymphony> if I got pregnant to someone who had said he loved me then he said 'what this wasn't anything i want you to abort' i'd still keep the baby and i am very poor it would be very hard
[04:39:56] <sweetsymphony> and i would be heavily stigmatized
[04:40:29] <sweetsymphony> heaps of women are really poor really
[04:43:22] <sweetsymphony> and as much as people argue about abortion they also say a lot against single/unwed mothers so they don't put the two together somehow
[04:44:19] <sweetsymphony> you wonder all the people walking past the women with those sidewalks with the signs asking for help do they have strong views on abortion, maybe they yell at her to have one or maybe they just walk past

[06:37:52] <I_Am_M00t> It's funny how the moral relativism is always applied to preserve the status quo
[06:43:30] <causative_> yeah, like "don't judge what horrible things this culture is doing to its women and slaves, it's relative"
[06:43:57] <causative_> just because a group of people have traditionally done things a certain way, doesn't make it right
[06:44:36] <maplefinger> traditionalism itself is dying
[06:45:10] <causative_> fiddler on the roof
[06:47:42] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:48:56] <causative_> but objective morality is not the only alternative to cultural relativism
[06:49:19] <causative_> it should be recognized that ultimately all moral decisions rest with the individual, not the culture
[06:49:31] <causative_> the culture only influences the individual
[06:49:46] <causative_> and when I say the individual I mean you
[06:50:15] <causative_> no one can determine for you what is moral, except yourself; all judgments you make about morality are your own judgments, and you cannot escape this basic fact
[06:50:34] <causative_> and the same goes for me, and I may make different judgments from you, and that does not mean we're both right
[06:50:51] <causative_> it means that I judge you to be wrong and you judge me to be wrong
[06:55:56] <causative_> for you, the philosopher, to make a moral judgment (or any judgment), is to judge also that whoever in the whole world disagrees with you, those people are wrong
[06:56:14] <causative_> regardless of their culture
[06:59:47] <causative_> we each must accept the responsibility of deciding for ourselves what we think is right
[06:59:52] <maplefinger> theres really no frame other than silly tribal arbitrary beliefs
[07:02:25] <sweetsymphony> then you get people who do wrong knowing it's wrong but knowing they can get away with it
[07:03:05] <sweetsymphony> like all the 99.9% of rapists that do, like Donald Trump, 'grab em by the pussy' like Epstein...but oh eventually he didn't
[07:04:14] <sweetsymphony> even like trolls online who spread lies, bully, troll or tell people to kill themselves or they will kill you, they know noone's ever going to get them in any trouble or care about them saying that
[07:04:18] <sweetsymphony> so they just do it
[07:04:25] <sweetsymphony> do they think they are right?
[07:04:32] <sweetsymphony> i don't know
[07:04:39] <causative_> no, they're not right
[07:05:10] <causative_> like I said before, "we each decide for ourselves" doesn't mean "we're all equally right"; it means I decide for myself, and judge anyone who disagrees to be wrong, and each other person does the same
[07:05:29] <sweetsymphony> yes it's a good point to think about causative_
[07:07:36] <maplefinger> then right and wrong do not exist, nor do they matter.  They are personal preferences.
[07:09:05] <causative_> well, don't be so hasty
[07:09:23] <causative_> because preferences can be wrong
[07:11:13] <causative_> suppose it's Christmas eve and I desperately need one last Christmas gift so I think about where I could go - Barnes&Noble maybe, or Christmas Tree Shops.  And I decide I prefer Barnes & Noble.  Then I go there and it's closed, but Christmas Tree Shops is open.  So my preference was wrong.
[07:11:50] <causative_> so it's not just about what people think in the moment - it's what they would think if they fixed their wrong preferences
[07:13:05] <causative_> a second point:  whether things "matter" - in your judgment - is whether you judge them to matter.  That's a tautology.  And you *do* judge some things to matter; if someone swings a baseball bat at you, you will judge it matters and try to get out of the way.
[07:13:28] <causative_> you inescapably judge that some things matter, you inescapably value some things over others
[07:13:37] <causative_> your biology forces you to do that
[07:14:35] <causative_> the question for you is then not whether anything matters - because to you it does; that question is answered.  The question is specifically what matters.
[07:23:15] <audrey> God, will you never stop lecturing.
[07:23:47] <audrey> Heh, you have nice taste in books though. Barnes and Noble is a good place. :)
[07:28:18] <maplefinger> sounds too generalized
[07:28:35] <maplefinger> you're conflating "right vs wrong" with "arbitrary" which was, in fact, my point :)

[07:29:51] <maplefinger> <causative_> suppose it's Christmas eve and I desperately need one last Christmas gift so I think about where I could go
[07:29:56] <maplefinger> arbitrary choice
[07:30:24] <maplefinger> right and wrong, too, are arbitrary choices.  you used something arbitrary to try to make a statement that the context could be subjective
[07:30:26] <maplefinger> but isn't
[07:30:35] <causative_> not totally arbitrary, it depends on who I'd be buying the gift for and what kinds of things they would like
[07:30:51] <causative_> and whether the store is open or closed
[07:31:42] <causative_> there are rational reasons to pick one store or another, and what is arrived at by reason may be wrong because the reasoning was wrong
[07:32:08] <maplefinger> causative_ those aren't "right vs wrong" decisions morally
[07:32:10] <maplefinger> that's my point
[07:32:35] <maplefinger> you're just describing deduction, and then pretending that applies to judging other tribal norms :)
[07:32:48] <causative_> they aren't moral decisions, but it was just an example - they are decisions about preferences, and decisions about morality are *also* decisions about preferences, and decisions about morality can be wrong for the same kinds of reasons
[07:33:12] <maplefinger> no it cannot
[07:33:25] <maplefinger> there's no morality store to be closed, and no special person to give it to :)
[07:33:45] <causative_> for a more morally-related example, let's say that I want society to do well, and I think the best way to do this is by executing thieves, so my morality system now has a strong value that thieves should be executed
[07:33:52] <maplefinger> you have to create an argument based on something meaningful
[07:34:04] <maplefinger> I guess you dont know morals are considered lawlike to many people
[07:34:11] <causative_> but further suppose that a thorough sociological analysis of executing thieves demonstrates beyond a doubt that this is harmful to society
[07:34:16] <causative_> and I didn't know this beforehand
[07:34:31] <maplefinger> lol "you"
[07:34:36] <causative_> but once I learned it, because I only wanted to execute thieves because I wanted society to do well, I would then *change* my value about executing thieves
[07:34:40] <maplefinger> ok
[07:34:44] <causative_> I would judge that the value I had previously held was wrong
[07:35:03] <maplefinger> yeah see thats not a moral
[07:35:06] <maplefinger> that's akin to an ethic
[07:35:23] <maplefinger> using evidence and approximation as well as case examples to change your own opinion
[07:35:30] <maplefinger> thats when it's not morals anymore
[07:35:50] <maplefinger> morals are the rules you want others to obey, that you pretend to obey socially
[07:35:51] <causative_> "moral" and "ethic" are essentially synonymous, depending on the context
[07:36:04] <causative_> in some contexts they are not synonymous but without being specific it really is ambiguous
[07:36:45] <causative_> a moral or an ethic are a rule for how we think people ought to act, or how we'd prefer them to act
[07:36:57] <causative_> *is
[07:37:03] <maplefinger> okay you just described changing your own morals
[07:37:07] <maplefinger> that's what makes it not a moral
[07:37:10] <maplefinger> get it?
[07:37:37] <causative_> so you're *defining* morals to be values you hold that can never ever change?
[07:37:50] <causative_> or beliefs about how people should act, that can never ever change?
[07:38:38] <maplefinger> not in the frame of discussion, correct
[07:38:46] <causative_> by that definition nothing would be a moral
[07:38:55] <maplefinger> oh but it is
[07:38:55] <causative_> because people can change their minds
[07:38:58] <maplefinger> belief in god
[07:39:01] <causative_> that can change
[07:39:03] <maplefinger> belief in religious doctrines
[07:39:08] <maplefinger> belief that abortion is wrong
[07:39:12] <causative_> all of that can change
[07:39:18] <maplefinger> then they're not morals anymore :)
[07:39:20] <maplefinger> get it?
[07:39:32] <causative_> "anymore"?  so they were morals up until the person changed their mind?
[07:39:44] <maplefinger> the changing of the mind is not germane
[07:40:06] <causative_> the changing of the mind is the main subject I was talking about

[07:40:28] <maplefinger> I already told you, morals are imposed, or at the very least, judgment parameters, based on the observer/observer group, witnessing others
[07:40:43] <maplefinger> well then what you are describing has nothing to do with morals.
[07:40:47] <maplefinger> it's ethics
[07:41:30] <causative_> well, IMO you are using an idiosyncratic definition of "morals," but if you wish we can say "ethics" instead from here on, unless you add some other idiosyncratic definition to "ethics" too
[07:42:07] <causative_> I am speaking of people's beliefs about how people should behave, or about what outcomes are good and what outcomes are bad
[07:42:23] <causative_> it makes no difference to me if you want to call that "ethics" or "morals" as long as we can be consistent about it

[07:44:00] <maplefinger> You're probably lost on what the discussion was about
[07:44:11] <maplefinger> it was generally about small groups defining norms, then comparing them to others
[07:44:32] <maplefinger> differentiated tribes and their various non-overlapping rituals or customs
[07:44:44] <maplefinger> now, if you invade them and colonize them and make them do what you want
[07:44:51] <maplefinger> that, itself is a package of imposed morals
[07:45:19] <maplefinger> stepping back
[07:45:56] <maplefinger> if you merely judge them, such as for having certain equality among the races and calling it bad, that too is a moral judgment
[07:46:00] <maplefinger> if you hate them
[07:46:04] <maplefinger> it comes from morals.

[07:46:24] <maplefinger> if you enhance their material conditions without punishing them, however
[07:46:34] <maplefinger> this is the ethos, the liberal mindset
[07:47:02] <maplefinger> It is a moral to perform clitorectomies.  It is not a moral to prevent clitorectomies.  Do you see?
[07:48:34] <causative_> that's not the way most people use the word "moral"
[07:48:35] *** Joins: z_lehinsun (~lehinsun@188.113.178.220)
[07:49:35] <maplefinger> a deeply held belief that restricts others
[07:49:59] <maplefinger> well then, should we use a new word?  Because my description is the realpolitik
[07:50:51] <maplefinger> you can like them or not like them, but if you invade and enslave them, and call yourself the godly ones, maybe that's not ethics, maybe that's something else like plain greed and erotic ultravioolence
[07:51:03] <causative_> your various examples and definitions of "moral" contradict each other
[07:51:15] <maplefinger> ok
[07:51:33] <maplefinger> what do YOU think is important when one culture relates to another?
[07:51:42] <maplefinger> changing them to make them like yours?
[07:51:52] <maplefinger> only changing the parts you don't like?
[07:51:58] <maplefinger> merely complaining about those parts?
[07:52:06] <causative_> if you say "It is not a moral to prevent clitorectomies," and you say a moral is "a deeply held belief that restricts others," then isn't preventing clitorectomies restricting someone from performing them?
[07:52:09] <maplefinger> or leaving them alone / being purely accepting?
[07:52:14] <maplefinger> those are mutually exclusive outcomes
[07:52:24] <maplefinger> and they all come with baggage, especially in real historical examples.
[07:52:38] <sweetsymphony> how about preventing circumcision
[07:52:42] <maplefinger> causative_ lil hint on that one: nobody wants one done to them
[07:52:49] <sweetsymphony> until the man is old enough to chose for himself
[07:52:56] <maplefinger> sorry I had to point that out
[07:53:06] <causative_> yes but you're restricting the person performing the action
[07:53:19] <maplefinger> yes how dare I suggest we prevent murder, etc
[07:53:24] <maplefinger> harm is an act of freedom
[07:53:32] <maplefinger>   *whoooosh*
[07:54:09] <causative_> do you think it is a moral to prevent murder, by your definition of "moral"?

[07:58:21] <maplefinger> pretty sad ritual, if we're judging tribes.
[07:58:32] <audrey> Mumble mumble, absurdity of religion in the 21st century
[07:58:35] <causative_> it seems like you've redefined "moral" to mean "only something bad," and have decided anything other people would call a "moral" that has positive qualities associated with it, you will decline to call a moral
[07:59:16] <causative_> I mean, you're free to do that, but it makes communication difficult, and inventing your own private terminology different from everyone else's doesn't prove anything about reality

[08:15:42] <maplefinger> "These Hutus are subhuman, they are cockroaches"  <--- this is a moral pronunciation
[08:15:54] <causative_> most people wouldn't say that

[08:16:32] *** Joins: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan)
[08:16:42] <maplefinger> most people who have morals will tell you all the ways they use them to hate others
[08:16:48] <maplefinger> there's nothing good about them
[08:16:48] <causative_> most people understand "morals" to be stuff like:  don't lie, steal, cheat, kill; do unto others what you would have them do unto you
[08:16:56] <maplefinger> here's a moral:  chastity.  Never fuck.
[08:16:59] <causative_> those are generally good things
[08:17:00] <maplefinger> defend that one :D
[08:17:34] <maplefinger> "do unto others what you would have them do unto you" goes off the rails when you talk about harming others
[08:17:42] <maplefinger> such as the case of clitorectomies
[08:18:00] <maplefinger> most of the time, it is the child's own mother or grandmother who takes them to be held down and cut.
[08:18:07] <maplefinger> they scream the entire time.
[08:18:20] <maplefinger> but it was "as unto me, so unto you"
[08:18:26] <maplefinger> golden oppression :)
[08:18:59] <maplefinger> My friend went to west Africa and documented this tradition, this practice, in detail
[08:19:09] <maplefinger> she is a white woman, horrified, but felt it was important to share.
[08:19:17] <maplefinger> I've seen a lot of photos.
[08:19:22] <maplefinger> genital mutilations
[08:19:39] <maplefinger> it's an easy litmus test for these sorts of tangled hierarchies, regardless if you call it "moral" or not.
[08:20:10] <maplefinger> in nearby tribes, if an infant boy happens to injure his penis, he is killed instantly.
[08:20:49] <I_Am_M00t> maplefinger: the things that have been done in the name of love
[08:21:06] <maplefinger> I believe the Dinka practice this, and that's not a small ethnicity.
[08:21:20] <I_Am_M00t> maybe the problem lies in the very act of trying to find a clear ruleset for right and wrong
[08:21:37] <maplefinger> nah
[08:21:43] <I_Am_M00t> that people form blind spots
[08:21:54] <maplefinger> those can be established, but like I said at the start, it's always dependent upon a frame.
[08:22:26] <maplefinger> Incest is obviously bad and wrong because of birth defects, but if you are the last man on earth and the only women left are your daughters
[08:22:36] <maplefinger> well that one's in the Bible, speaking of "morals" XD
[08:23:19] <maplefinger> here's another one regarding incest: what if your sister is past menopause
[08:23:28] <maplefinger> the moral kinda breaks down, doesn't it?
[08:23:50] <maplefinger> (nobody ever wants to have that discussion because people who chat philosophy are very guarded about taboos)
[08:24:10] <I_Am_M00t> it's more of an ethical statement then
[08:24:43] <maplefinger> :) thanks
[08:24:45] <I_Am_M00t> but, in some cultures even today cousins marry
[08:24:53] <maplefinger> well causative_ the definitions are mine, plus one :D
[08:25:00] <I_Am_M00t> no need to talk about last man and woman
[08:25:02] <maplefinger> yes yes
[08:25:10] <maplefinger> all of us are the products of cousin intermarriage
[08:25:17] <maplefinger> all of us, somewhere, on our fam trees
[08:25:42] <maplefinger> the average person roved a radius of about 6-10 miles in medieval england, for example
[08:25:55] <maplefinger> Einstein
[08:25:59] <maplefinger> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:26:12] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: what do you think about cultures where cousins marry? wrong?
[08:31:24] <pussipupu> Interestingly in UK law it's permitted for double cousins to marry
[08:36:55] <maplefinger> what's a double cousin? your parents on both sides are siblings?
[08:37:20] <maplefinger> that would explain the teeth on the island, lol
[08:40:21] <I_Am_M00t> i have to draw a graph to understand that relationship
[08:44:34] <maplefinger> that's what they must mean.  Second cousins are allowed to marry everywhere.
[08:45:11] <I_Am_M00t> k, so like two sisters marry two brother, their kids are double cousins
[08:45:21] <I_Am_M00t> 💪
[08:46:24] <maplefinger> yeah
[08:46:37] <maplefinger> what gets "doubled" is the exposure risk, I suppose, mathematically

[12:57:24] <Lumine> Go to town!
[12:57:50] <arryana> celebrating a little seems in order
[12:57:59] <Lumine> I'm celebrating tomorrow
[12:58:27] <arryana> our food delivery comes today, i'm curious to see how much of stuff actually arrives
[12:58:36] <arryana> we had something of a christmas goose debacle
[12:58:46] <Lumine> Mother comes to visit me and spend the day tomorrow, I have so much stuff and my artwork to show her, and good music to listen to
[12:59:00] <arryana> we ordered it weeks ago, but had it removed from the cart because they didn't have one
[12:59:03] <Lumine> I see
[12:59:05] <arryana> oooh
[12:59:07] <arryana> that will be lovely
[12:59:17] <Lumine> Yes
[12:59:35] <Lumine> Oh that's a shame about the goose
[12:59:39] <arryana> my mother in law, sadly, will not be coming.  my other half's sister threw a tantrum about it and emotionally blackmailed her with the 'you always favor them!' argument.
[12:59:52] <arryana> which is not only childish and stupid, but we haven't seen her for more than a year.
[13:00:05] <Lumine> :(
[13:00:05] <arryana> they assured us we'd get a turkey, so i can live with it
[13:00:49] <Lumine> I've been trying out a new painting program, it will be interesting to see which one I stick with
[13:00:56] <arryana> some people apparently never grow up.  she's north of 50, and still cares who 'the favorite' is
[13:00:59] <arryana> oooh
[13:01:07] <arryana> new tools are -so- much fun
[13:01:21] <Lumine> Indeed
[13:01:34] <Lumine> And that sounds immature to say the least
[13:02:50] <arryana> it isn't the first time she's thrown this brand of tantrum either.  i'm more bent out of shape at her because she's been ignoring covid precautions, is unwell, and is -still- planning to take their mother to christmas dinner at a restaurant she likes but her mother doesn't.
[13:03:07] <arryana> not to mention bringing someone she knows, but her mother does not.  that seems to me to be a crappy thing to do on christmas.

[13:04:55] <arryana> we gave in to her rather bitchy demands to have a pub christmas lunch -once-.  we ended up stuck with the entire bill.  she also showed up late and as soon as the last plate was cleared she said, 'well, i have to go.  let's put my presents in the car.'.  she packed up the stuff we gave her, handed us our 'present' which was a hand written note to say that 50 quid had been donated to a
[13:04:55] <arryana> charity for horses, and took off.
[13:05:06] <arryana> needless to say, we're not fans of having christmas with her.
[13:07:59] <arryana> what cracks me up, though, is that the next year for christmas we donated an emergency shelter and a month's worth of food to a charity that does such things, in her name.  she got -furious- with me that we didn't give her an 'actual present' even though she'd done exactly that to us the year before.  we were then informed that in future we are to give her cash only, and more than 50
[13:07:59] <arryana> quid.
[13:08:06] <arryana> which is not gonna happen.
[13:09:22] <arryana> i really don't know how people like that get through life.  she's lonely, and deserves to be.  but she never sees that it's her behavior that causes it.
[13:14:48] <plankster> christmas is better without gifts
[13:16:49] <arryana> we're minimalists that way in general.  we sent the other half's mom a treat hamper and a bottle of wine.  for the other half, i got him a custom tshirt with pictures of the dogs, and a lego fender guitar set.  by the size of the package under the tree, he got me the tunisian crochet set i've been wanting.  the rest of the presents are for the dogs.
[13:17:19] <arryana> we splashed out a bit on food and alcohol for a nice christmas dinner, but that's about it, otherwise
[13:18:37] <arryana> we got our favorite people one nice thing each, a vintage leather doctor bag for doctor girlfriend, a miniature dodge viper for my little hacker, etc.
[13:20:36] <arryana> my own mother has been terminal for some time, and is down to 90 lbs and failing rapidly, so she specifically said she didn't want anything but a phone call.
[13:21:22] <arryana> she can't really eat or drink anything much anymore, and she stresses on what will happen to the stuff she already has, adding to that would not be a gift to her.

[15:19:52] <Lumine> I guess, but I lack certain basic skills. I didn't even start reading books until 2018. Which shocked a former English teacher because she had just read a text I had written that same year.
[15:20:42] <Ungwelian> It's good to think through things yourself.
[15:23:37] <arryana> late education is a mixed bag, the fact that you're picking it up at all is what matters.
[15:24:10] <arryana> i have a friend who is nearly illiterate, she never went to school.  but she is for sure a profound thinker, and lacking the normal social mores, she's fascinating to be around.
[15:25:07] <arryana> none of her ideas are filtered through the normal learning channels, so her thinking is always a new take, even if it's an old idea.
[15:25:22] <arryana> you're likely to bring a similar fresh take to things.

[15:27:49] <arryana> she attended one day of kindergarten and decided it wasn't for her.  her mother was very much a free spirit, who taught her at home, but died of cancer when my friend was fifteen.  she had enough money and sense to stay below the radar until she was 18.

[15:55:39] <Lumine> The reason why Douglas Adams chose the number 42 is because if you look at the 42nd ASCII code, you'll see that it's an asterisk symbol *, which means it can be anything you want it to be. So Douglas was right in a way in saying that the meaning of life is 42.
[15:56:08] <darklambda> ooh.. didn't know about the ascii origin

[17:57:55] <audrey> Honestly I would be happy to never celebrate Christmas at all.
[17:58:24] <audrey> I dislike the social pressure of both having to find gifts for people, *and* pretending to like the gifts other people give me.
[17:59:09] <audrey> Plus all the cultural pressure to "be home for the holidays" and "be with family" when I don't have a very good relationship with my family ... that just emphasizes how "abnormal" I am.

[18:17:34] <audrey> Meh. I can´t complain
[18:17:40] <audrey> Everything in life is a tradeoff, including this.
[18:18:18] <arryana> that's a very balanced view.
[18:18:42] <arryana> i have a few friends who were formerly alcoholics, and so, no longer drink.
[18:19:03] <arryana> three of them have no issue with other people drinking around them, one insists that everyone be sober.
[18:19:30] <arryana> while i am happy to be supportive of a friend, i do think it's a little selfish to demand that everyone else pay for their mistake.
[18:19:36] <audrey> I mean, it´s usually not fun to be around intoxicated people if you´re sober
[18:19:52] <audrey> so I understand that, though I would probably just not go to an event like that in the first place
[18:20:14] <audrey> since the flip side is that if other people are getting tipsy/drunk, they don´t want to be around you as a sober person, either.
[18:20:39] <arryana> well, for the bulk of the gatherings it's a mix of sober and drinking people, and it's rare that anyone's drunk.
[18:20:48] <arryana> unless it's an event like a bachelor party
[18:20:55] <audrey> Ah, gotcha
[18:21:33] <arryana> it's a lot more the sort of group of 'let's have a glass of wine and play chess'
[18:22:02] <arryana> i guess for me it's on par with a hard core vegan telling everyone else that they can't be around anyone who eats meat.

[18:22:58] <arryana> they are absolutely within their rights to have the freedom to eat or not eat anything they want.  when they start dictating rules of what i can eat or not, that's license.

[19:10:35] <arryana> excellent idea
[19:14:04] <biys> 22:19 < causative_> it should be recognized that ultimately all moral decisions rest with the individual, not the culture
[19:14:34] <biys> i think if people operated in a vacuum, they would be void of morals.
[19:14:44] <biys> morals are traditional aspects
[19:14:53] <biys> they've been passed down and passed down
[19:14:54] <edantes> no innate morals?
[19:15:21] <biys> i think the only proof of that at this point is Panksepp's rat tickling edantes
[19:15:28] <biys> but that is rats
[19:15:30] <biys> not humans
[19:15:34] <edantes> animals have no morals? why do they comfort the dying? or they teach each other morals to each other in secret
[19:16:06] <edantes> biys interesting never heard of Panksepp's rat will look it up
[19:16:33] <biys> problem i see with making a claim as to some kind of innate biological function
[19:16:59] <biys> is that once we make a claim to peopel have biological characteristics we start sliding down a slippery slope
[19:17:25] <biys> because if a person has some kind of abhorrent biological characteristic
[19:17:32] <biys> we can't necessarily say they are a terrible person
[19:17:40] <biys> we simply have to accept it
[19:18:03] <edantes> yes, and i think it's not that bad if we admit being terrible is ok
[19:18:08] <edantes> well, could be ok
[19:18:51] <audrey> I´m fine with biting the bullet & accepting there is no such thing as objective morality, personally.
[19:19:01] <edantes> if it has been proven that we developed innate pro-community traits and behaviours, morals could be part of it, and the judgment on them a posteriori makes no sense (society, communities, etc. might have changed and useful traits could not be applicable anymore)
[19:19:20] <biys> audrey: i am too actually.  the problem i have with it is... i'd likely be called something terrible for giving the examples i could give
[19:19:24] <audrey> It wouldn´t change how I live my life and seems of little practical significance, at least compared to the enormous intellectual effort philosophers spend on this.
[19:19:40] <arryana> i have to agree, audrey.  if there was objective morality, there'd be a lot fewer arguments over what is moral.  also, morality changes over time.
[19:19:48] <audrey> I´m not going to become an ax murderer just because I wake up tomorrow and discover god and afterlife don´t exist.
[19:19:59] <audrey> This seems like an unrealistic sort of framing for these kinds of questions.
[19:20:22] <audrey> Contrariwise, most people who engage in activities we consider immoral, probably don´t care if god exists or not.
[19:20:34] <arryana> i think tha argument of 'objective morality' is for people who want to believe their morals are right,and should thus be universal
[19:20:39] <audrey> «It´s all academic!»
[19:21:51] <audrey> biys: Put another way, I agree with Dostoyevsky that «if there is no God, then everything is allowed.» Except, unlike Dostoyevsky, I affirm the antecedent and accept the consequent.
[19:21:55] <edantes> please give an exmaple where incest is A-OK i can't find any
[19:22:25] <audrey> Whereas for Dostoyevsky the mere thought of «everything is allowed» is so repulsive that it must be the case that God exists.

[19:38:53] <brigand> oh "Moral universalism is opposed to moral nihilism and moral relativism. However, not all forms of moral universalism are absolutist, nor are they necessarily value monist; many forms of universalism, such as utilitarianism, are non-absolutist, and some forms, such as that of Isaiah Berlin, may be value pluralist.[citation needed]"

[19:43:25] <mannequin> ok
[19:43:36] <Ungwelian> And there are definite behaviours that are conducive to life and happiness.

[19:46:14] <Ungwelian> Isn't it self-evident ?

[19:48:02] <brigand> Ungwelian: are you saying there wouldn't be life without objective morality?
[19:48:54] <Ungwelian> No, I'm saying life is an objective moral quality.
[19:49:08] <Ungwelian> It's the basis of morality.
[19:50:06] <I_Am_M00t> hmm
[19:52:43] <brigand> isn't life the basis of everything? basically
[19:52:57] <Ungwelian> No, because there's existence without life.
[19:53:35] <I_Am_M00t> you mean that, only living things can have moral values?

[19:55:03] <arryana> that seems like a win
[19:55:18] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but then life is a foundation/prerequisite, but not so much a moral quality?
[19:55:39] <Ungwelian> It's both.
[19:55:50] <I_Am_M00t> how is it a moral quality?
[19:56:04] <Ungwelian> Because it's the basis of anything for living beings.
[19:56:27] <Ungwelian> Insomuch as we want anything, we must be alive.
[19:56:31] <arryana> i think age is kind that way, enough years of responsibility and i found that things out of my control are more of a relief than a burden.
[19:56:44] <I_Am_M00t> hrm
[19:56:59] <I_Am_M00t> ok
[19:57:20] <Ungwelian> And our survival depends on life too.
[19:58:33] <Ungwelian> So by that, it's objective morality to keep the Earth habitable.
[19:58:48] <Ungwelian> Which means green values.
[19:59:26] <Ungwelian> Insomuch as they are conducive to life and happiness.
[19:59:50] <I_Am_M00t> what if the word objective is tainted by... subjectivity? hehe
[20:00:07] <Ungwelian> Everyone has opinions, of course.
[20:00:16] <Ungwelian> But it doesn't mean that there's no truth.
[20:00:30] <I_Am_M00t> no, i mean fundamentally, that the word objective has no... objective definition
[20:00:32] <brigand> i think what most people mean by "objective morality" is "moral absolutism", don't they? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism Moral absolutism  is an ethical view that all actions are intrinsically right or wrong. Stealing, for instance, might be considered to be always immoral,  even if done for the well-being of others (e.g., stealing food to feed a  starving family), and even if it does in the end promote such a good.
[20:00:32] <ro-bot-o> [url] Moral absolutism - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[20:01:19] <I_Am_M00t> yes, it sound a bit like christian thinking

[20:11:13] <zicada> for religious people, thats God

[20:11:55] <zicada> absolutism is more about there only being one possible way to be morral
[20:12:06] <zicada> *moral
[20:13:09] <brigand> oh, i see. so what's the correct definition of "objective morality"?
[20:13:29] <zicada> brigand: depends who you ask
[20:15:09] <brigand> heh
[20:15:14] <zicada> objective morality is the idea that there is a fact of the matter about how one should act in the world. For religious most religious people, God is the source of that for them
[20:15:26] <zicada> for the rest of us, there is no way to turn an ought into an is
[20:15:59] <zicada> morality is opinion-based, people may disagree on what is or isnt moral with nobody being factually correct
[20:16:19] <zicada> making morality subjective for non-believers
[20:17:30] <zicada> brigand: this is the "problem" that gives rise to people like Nietsche and Kierkegaard
[20:17:57] <brigand> i see
[20:18:12] <brigand> thank you! :)
[20:23:36] <brigand> so for non-believers no moral stance is/can be universal
[20:23:53] <zicada> that is my position, but not the only position
[20:24:14] <zicada> some non-believers claim to have objective reasons for universal morality
[20:24:36] <zicada> most famously Sam Harris in The moral lanscape (very much worth a read if you youre interested in this problem)
[20:24:42] <zicada> its an honest attempt
[20:25:12] <zicada> but Hume seems to remain right, that no matter how hard you try, you can't turn an ought into an is (Humes guillotine)
[20:26:12] <zicada> Personally im a fan of Sam's for many reasons, but I disagree with him at least at the time of writing that book
[20:26:38] <zicada> he has somewhat modified his position since then
[20:26:46] <zicada> but not really
[20:27:29] <brigand> thank you
[20:28:25] <zicada> brigand: Sam says that if you imagine the worst possible suffering, then surely we can all agree nobody would want that. So if we base morality on that, we have an objective reason
[20:28:59] <zicada> brigand: but its not objective, you could imagine people who have wildly different views, we cant just assume that every other human will auto-agree with things most of us consider obvious
[20:29:14] <zicada> we can't in philosophy anyway, there are logic rules :)

[20:48:38] <biys> this conversation and this channel
[20:48:39] <biys> haha
[20:48:46] <biys> constantly comes back to the same thing
[20:49:10] <biys> i'm still waiting for Ungwelian to show me how the world/universe is fair
[20:49:24] <biys> and how the idea of fairness isn't simply just a construct that exists in their mind
[20:49:32] <biys> idealistic
[20:51:13] <biys> just because i _think_ the world should operate in a specific way, doesn't mean it has to work in that way
[20:51:34] <arryana> i don't think 'we can all agree that nobody wants that', there's a brilliant story by ursula leguin called 'the ones who walk away from omelas' which addresses that
[20:51:41] <biys> furthermore, i'd like to read the justification of why one would think the world ought to be any particular way or another
[20:52:12] <biys> i think the oceans should be filled with jello
[20:52:22] <biys> yum!
[20:53:05] <biys> there is a difference between saying that "within the society i live, the idea of fairness and equity should exist"
[20:53:08] <arryana> the premise of 'omelas' is that an entire society of people get to be free, happy, fulfilled.  but at the cost of a single child suffering horribly.
[20:53:15] <biys> vs. "the world ought to act in this particular way or that"

[21:00:05] <I_Am_M00t> lol, what i find funny with biys is, his whole spiel falls apart as soon as you apply what he says to his own value system
[21:00:34] <biys> care to elaborate?
[21:01:05] <I_Am_M00t> everything he says is a defense of conservative values, but in the same way liberal values can't be defended objectively (in a deeper sense), neither can his conservative ones
[21:01:19] <biys> i have conservative values?
[21:01:26] <biys> i tend to think i have no values
[21:01:31] <biys> but please, continue
[21:02:01] <I_Am_M00t> yet biys is proud over having pointed the logical flaw of one side out (with solipsism), but doesn't apply the same solipsism to his own ideals
[21:02:22] <biys> for example?
[21:02:30] <I_Am_M00t> that's where things fall apart for me, because biys is absolutely correct in that you can't make deeper objective claims about fairness
[21:03:13] <biys> what are my ideals?
[21:03:27] <biys> would you say, anyways
[21:03:40] <I_Am_M00t> it's just that it's hard to take the thought process seriously when it's exclusively applied according to the left side in a left/right political split
[21:03:55] <I_Am_M00t> otherwise ofc, biys is on point
[21:04:05] <biys> you think i'm "right", politically speaking?
[21:04:22] <biys> what if i told you i voted for Trudeau?
[21:04:35] <I_Am_M00t> haha :D
[21:04:54] <I_Am_M00t> i don't have a respond to that biys
[21:05:20] <biys> i think because i've defended the psychological significance of the bible, for example, you tend to think i'm a trad conservative maybe?
[21:05:27] <biys> which isn't really accurate.  i'm not religious at all
[21:05:48] <biys> i just recognize the "importance" of the bible in the current context of our society
[21:06:06] <I_Am_M00t> but the point is, if you're serious, apply the thought process to a few conservative ideals too, and it'll be easier to see it as serious thought exercise instead of a bunch of red herrrings
[21:06:16] <biys> i'm not conservative though
[21:06:20] <I_Am_M00t> i know
[21:06:22] <biys> i don't uphold trad conservative views
[21:06:29] <I_Am_M00t>  i know
[21:07:24] <biys> my position with regards to religion is that it's formulated the basis for a lot of the ideas people have
[21:07:35] <biys> the idea of equity and fairness, for example, is extremely judeo-christian
[21:07:38] <biys> the last will be first
[21:07:53] <biys> the meek will inherit the earth
[21:08:05] <biys> now that isn't to say that those ideas originated with judeo-christians
[21:08:16] <biys> that is simply the latest/most current rendition
[21:08:45] <biys> it is the frame of reference that most peopel have now days.  the abrahamic religions (generally speaking_
[21:09:00] <I_Am_M00t> i dont parse any clear meaning from this
[21:09:13] <I_Am_M00t> just sounds like more indirectness :) more of the same
[21:09:19] <biys> for someone to say to me that their ideas of fairness and equity are as a result of some form of free thinking is a laugh to me
[21:09:37] <biys> which is why i say "if it smells, acts, tastes like a duck, it's a duck'
[21:10:01] <I_Am_M00t> sounds like another red herring to me, but ofc you're right
[21:10:14] <I_Am_M00t> (just that... how does it apply here?)
[21:10:37] <I_Am_M00t> you can say a thousand correct things, doesn't mean theyre relevant
[21:11:00] <biys> this is still, imo, a respose to Ungwelian
[21:11:28] <biys> i'd like Ungwelian to kind of admit that their ideas of fairness and equity are strongly based off judeo-christian principals

[21:14:19] <biys> in that, as people attempted to understand more about "God" they understood more about the world

[21:28:36] <zicada> its also a political position, entirely subjective as such
[21:29:14] <zicada> philosophy cant really tell you what your subjective position ought to be, nor does it want to try, just to prepare you for attaining a position
[21:29:37] <zicada> and possibly (hopefully?) later changing that position when new information presents itself
[21:31:41] <biys> nonsense

[21:32:05] <biys> "god save the queen"
[21:32:16] <biys> the underpinning is entirely judeo-christian
[21:32:33] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, this hypocrisy is the issue with biys
[21:33:02] <biys> i think as of 2019 there's still over 200 million people who identify as christian in the USA
[21:33:24] <biys> it is decreasing, i wouldn't say organically
[21:33:35] <I_Am_M00t> his entire mission is to prove that conservatism is the way to go, yet to prove that he uses philosophical ideas that correctly wipe out leftist ideas... the problem being that they also wipe out conservativsm
[21:33:46] <biys> "the way to go"
[21:33:56] <I_Am_M00t> you cannot use solipsism to argue in favor of either biys, thats the issue

[21:49:49] <I_Am_M00t> biys: so what's your response about the fundamental hypocrisy and inconsistency of your arguments?
[21:49:58] <Ungwelian> I have great respect for Christian charity. As well as any charity, really.
[21:50:12] <zicada> Ungwelian: sure, as far as that goes
[21:50:29] <zicada> Ungwelian: but do you believe Jesus is the Son of God who came down from heaven etc
[21:50:37] <I_Am_M00t> you're fundamentally applying solipsism to defend a political stance.
[21:51:06] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: not seeing him using solipsism at all, i keep seeing your accusing him of it
[21:51:06] <Ungwelian> What I hate is people who are abusing religions to manipulate and take advantage of naive, poor and sick people.
[21:51:18] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: are you sure you and him are on the same level on what solipsism is ?
[21:51:18] <audrey> I_Am_M00t: Maybe don´t harass other commenters?
[21:51:22] <I_Am_M00t>  solipsism cannot be used constructively in first place biys
[21:51:51] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: it can be attempted, for sure
[21:52:04] <Ungwelian> zicada, nah, I don't believe in Jesus being the Son of God. Or in the trinitarian interpretation either, him being God.
[21:52:05] <zicada> i disagree you can write it off so easily
[21:52:33] <zicada> Ungwelian: me neither, a majority in the cultures we llives in do, though
[21:52:39] <zicada> *live
[21:53:02] <Ungwelian> I remember reading a commented Bible translated from Aramaic. It said that the term "Son of God" is used very rarely in the Bible. Far more often used term if "Son of Man".
[21:53:19] <Ungwelian> And in Aramaic form, "Son of Man" isn't capitalized and just means "human".
[21:53:29] <zicada> Ungwelian: they at least report that they do, but its hard to know the extent to their devotion hehe
[21:53:44] <zicada> amounts to showing up in church at chirstmas for many methinks
[21:53:51] <zicada> not much active uh
[21:54:25] <zicada> Ungwelian: hehe
[21:54:37] <zicada> Ungwelian: of course if the Bible was old testament it wouldnt have that much of it
[21:54:55] <Ungwelian> I think honest, analytical study of religion is important.
[21:55:00] <zicada> agreed
[21:55:05] <Ungwelian> Although it should be done compassionately.

[21:56:13] <zicada> Ungwelian: absolutely compassionatily, with an open mind
[21:56:27] <zicada> Ungwelian: not a mind pretrained in one direction or the other
[21:56:47] <zicada> Ungwelian: its our common history after all
[21:56:57] <Ungwelian> Yeah. I don't really like militant, aggressive atheism. To me it seems like taking own problems on other people.
[21:57:10] <zicada> me neither, i was a militant atheist teen
[21:57:15] <Ungwelian> :)
[21:57:16] <zicada> but i grew up and softened
[21:57:45] <zicada> now im mostly interested in religion and myth and weird things and the question of how much we can trust old history in general
[21:57:52] <zicada> from a skeptic pov
[21:58:11] <Ungwelian> I attended James Randi's talk in Helsinki uni auditorium. Full of ecstatic atheists. It was pretty scary.
[21:58:31] <Ungwelian> People standing up, clapping in one mass, telling Randi how he has given them salvation.
[21:58:38] <zicada> hehe, skeptics and atheists go together like bread and butter imo
[21:58:41] <Ungwelian> Hundreds of them.
[21:58:58] <Ungwelian> I was the only one who stood up and asked him to define "God". And he couldn't.
[21:59:09] <Ungwelian> Kinda surprised I wasn't beaten up :P
[21:59:14] <zicada> yeah but why ought he be able to do that
[21:59:37] <Ungwelian> Well, if you're severely against something, it's good to define what you're against.
[21:59:38] <zicada> its an entitity one group of humans believe created the earth
[21:59:53] <zicada> would that be an acceptable answer?
[22:00:21] <zicada> thats unfair imo
[22:00:33] <zicada> youre asking somebody who doesnt believe something to define it in your way
[22:00:40] <zicada> or you get to say they did it wrong
[22:00:55] <zicada> i like honesty
[22:00:58] <Ungwelian> My point is, he didn't have a clear idea of what he opposed.
[22:01:09] <Ungwelian> He couldn't even define God in his own words.
[22:01:25] <Ungwelian> And yet he had spent decades fighting God.
[22:01:27] <zicada> its an unfair request though
[22:01:32] <zicada> towards somebody who is not religious
[22:01:53] <Ungwelian> I don't think so. To me, it just seems like making God this "Other" and then going against it.
[22:02:00] <zicada> youre asking them to define what they think religious people define god as
[22:02:25] <zicada> not what THEY define God as
[22:02:27] <I_Am_M00t> James Randi, hmm
[22:02:29] <zicada> they don't define God as anything
[22:02:32] <Ungwelian> No, when he opposes God, I want to know what he opposes.
[22:02:35] <zicada> beacuse they don't believe in God
[22:02:40] <audrey> Ungwelian: It used to be in the Soviet Union that if you declared yourself an «atheist» you would be seen as a slightly pretentious bore. After all, if God doesn´t exist, why even dignify it with a label of opposition? Nobody goes around saying they are anti-Zeus or anti-phrenology because that would give Zeus and phrenology more credibility than they deserve.
[22:02:49] <I_Am_M00t> he opposes nonsense
[22:02:53] <I_Am_M00t> supernatural claims
[22:02:57] <I_Am_M00t> deception
[22:02:59] <audrey> I find it curious that a lot of self-identified atheists these days don´t recognize the silliness.
[22:03:06] <Ungwelian> I_Am_M00t, definitely.
[22:03:07] <zicada> Ungwelian: Atheists aren't opposing God though
[22:03:16] <zicada> Ungwelian: they simply disagree God exists

[22:04:31] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: i disagree there is such a thing, i think you are prescribing your own religion to someting very human we all expereicne
[22:04:36] <I_Am_M00t>  if you have your own highly secular version of Christianity, i don't think criticism from people like James Randi applies
[22:04:43] <Ungwelian> I found it very unnerving that he had gathered these ecstatic followers in his quest of opposition, yet seemed not to understand the structure of religious thought.

[22:05:00] <I_Am_M00t> i doubt he doesn't understand it, lol
[22:05:09] <zicada> me too
[22:05:28] <Ungwelian> He couldn't define God. That's a key point in esotericism.
[22:05:28] <I_Am_M00t> honestly, I've heard that argument too many times now, "you don't get what our belief system actually is"
[22:07:55] <Ungwelian> Also from what I have seen, few angry atheists seem to engage in esotericism.
[22:07:59] <I_Am_M00t> it's just a rhetorical trap imo, to have the opposition waste time qualifying themselves
[22:08:42] <Ungwelian> So then you have these two giant Ishtadevas. God and No-God. And followers doing battle, instead of dialogue.
[22:09:10] <zicada> Ungwelian: its like me saying "do you believe in the flying spaghetti monster ?" And then when they say no, you go "but you can't even define the spaghetti monster"
[22:09:13] <zicada> Ungwelian: why should they
[22:09:28] <Ungwelian> Because religious texts are important for many of the religious people.
[22:09:28] <zicada> theyre a figment of others imagination
[22:09:42] <zicada> i agree they are
[22:09:54] <zicada> they can remain important without all the idiocy we should know better about
[22:10:00] <Ungwelian> When you paint all that as "figments of imagination", it's denigrating people with a shallow judgement.
[22:10:12] <Ungwelian> There can be a lot of stuff behind religious world-views.
[22:10:18] <zicada> theyre 2000 year old ideas
[22:10:22] <Ungwelian> Exactly.
[22:10:22] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: why is that the correct division? isn't it possible that that it's a split between "thinking" and "asserting"?
[22:10:31] <I_Am_M00t> it's a false dichotomy
[22:10:36] <zicada> Ungwelian: everybody owned slaves back then etc
[22:10:43] <zicada> why should we listen to them ?
[22:10:53] <zicada> ancient bronze age pieces of shit
[22:11:09] <Ungwelian> A lot of religious people do. And they don't usually believe it verbatim. It's no different from science.
[22:11:15] <I_Am_M00t> religion does not hold authority to the fundamental idea of "god"
[22:11:15] <zicada> toxic masculine women hating gay hating pieces of shit
[22:11:28] <zicada> not the best source of morality
[22:11:29] <Ungwelian> There's scientific results secular people believe in and not.
[22:11:29] <zicada> imo
[22:11:31] <I_Am_M00t> they merely defined that term in a very dogmatic way, and made it the standard
[22:12:11] <Ungwelian> With religious texts, there's commentaries too. And often even the concept "religion" doesn't exist. So rather, the texts are philosophical.
[22:12:20] <I_Am_M00t> the reason you dont discuss terms like "god" with a christian, is because the christian has already established what it means
[22:12:29] <Ungwelian> Not necessarily.
[22:12:36] <I_Am_M00t> necessarily, hehe
[22:12:43] <zicada> what it means TO THEM
[22:12:47] <zicada> they fail to think of others
[22:12:51] <I_Am_M00t> I realize there are exceptions, but... they prove the rule hehe
[22:12:52] <zicada> a major theme with Jesus
[22:13:04] <Ungwelian> Lots of Christians are not into esotericism or even exegesis.
[22:13:16] <Ungwelian> Many have a fuzzy idea of God.
[22:13:31] <zicada> they are egoists who dont give a fuck about society around them
[22:13:39] <zicada> and only want as much as possible for themselves
[22:13:48] <zicada> thats NOT supposed to be the christian mindset
[22:13:58] <zicada> thats supposed to be the SINFUL thing
[22:14:01] <zicada> ok ?
[22:14:02] <Ungwelian> Some are Christians basically in name only. For example in Finland, plenty of people are part of the Church records, yet never go to the Church.
[22:14:16] <I_Am_M00t> i want to know what their policy stances are :) then I'll have a talk. If they  hold beliefs like "god exists, and therefore homosexuality is bad"
[22:14:21] <I_Am_M00t> then the discussion is over
[22:15:05] <Ungwelian> Yeah, I wouldn't like that either.
[22:15:12] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: do you meet many christians who are cool with homosex ?
[22:15:27] <I_Am_M00t> "i uphold judeo Christian beliefs, but am not christian" is another funny one. They uphold are the morally corrupt values, but don't believe in being good, haha
[22:15:29] <zicada> they exist, but they are rare amirite
[22:15:37] <I_Am_M00t> it's a have your cake and eat it too situation
[22:16:03] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: no it isnt, "judeo-christian-values" is a recent US invention
[22:17:08] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: the diff between majority catholic and majority protestant kingdoms becoming nations has affected their institutions a lot in very different ways
[22:17:16] <zicada> Ungwelian rather

[22:17:45] <zicada> it was culture that did that, culture that was to some extent affected by religion
[22:17:52] <zicada> much so early on, less so later on
[22:18:38] <zicada> religion doesnt create culture after all, culture creates religion
[22:18:44] <zicada> and religion remains a part of culture over time
[22:18:49] <zicada> the constant is culture
[22:24:33] <Ungwelian> There's plenty of cases where that division doesn't exist :)
[22:26:29] <zicada> those are matters of definition, then
[22:26:52] <Ungwelian> In the uni, I think they gave China as example. Or was it Japan.
[22:27:13] <Ungwelian> The point was, that people were using various religions for different issues.
[22:27:48] <Ungwelian> For example, Buddhism with issues having to do with death. And Christianity and ancestor worship too.
[22:28:05] <zicada> Ungwelian: hmm
[22:28:13] <zicada> Ungwelian: in China, only 2% or so are religious
[22:28:27] <zicada> it depends on definition, what do we mean when we say religious
[22:28:48] <Ungwelian> The ancestor cult was used with household issues. Christianity, I don't remember. Might have been holidays.
[22:28:54] <Ungwelian> Confucianism, with morality.
[22:28:58] <zicada> i would argue the Abrahamics are a group onto their own in many ways
[22:29:37] <zicada> theyre all im sure, encompassing wider things, its not that
[22:29:56] <zicada> its that theyre not real but are treated as special in modern science and culture
[22:30:11] <zicada> not like every other other myth of humanity
[22:30:14] <zicada> but as special
[22:30:37] <Ungwelian> When you say "they're not real", what do you mean by this exactly?
[22:30:58] <zicada> yet objectivity it is just another myth of humanity, it just so happens a lot of people have strong beliefs assoicated with it, and that matters for some reason
[22:31:42] <zicada> tradition vs science and progress
[22:32:05] <Ungwelian> But science uses tradition too.
[22:32:13] <Ungwelian> "Scientific consensus"
[22:32:35] <zicada> consensus isnt about tradition
[22:32:45] <zicada> its what the majority of scientists think about a matter at the time
[22:32:45] <Ungwelian> Established tradition.
[22:33:02] <zicada> consensus simply means a majority agree on something
[22:33:13] <Ungwelian> Yeah. And minds don't change easily :)
[22:33:25] <zicada> its a good thing, it means you can say "the majority of scientists think this is true, therefore its most likely true"
[22:33:49] <Ungwelian> That can be so. But it's also a dangerous, collectivist thought.
[22:34:21] <zicada> majority-rule ?
[22:34:33] <Ungwelian> The idea that the group is right.
[22:34:34] <zicada> i mean compared to minority-rule it seems pretty good
[22:34:40] <Ungwelian> I mean, this is how we arrived at witch hunts.
[22:34:41] <zicada> depends how big the minority is
[22:35:02] <zicada> Ungwelian: no, its not the idea that the group is right
[22:35:13] <zicada> Ungwelian: its the idea that the group is right because its the biggest group
[22:35:22] <zicada> eg has the most voters
[22:35:45] <Ungwelian> It's just been a few decades since homosexuality was illegal in Finland. And considered a mental sickness.
[22:35:55] <zicada> its the idea that whatever most people in the land think, is probably the way to go
[22:35:56] <Ungwelian> Took a lot of minority work and untold suffering for that to change.
[22:36:29] <zicada> Ungwelian: yea welcome to modernity
[22:36:40] <zicada> not really the same, but similar, sure
[22:37:04] <Ungwelian> There's prolly scientific papers about homosexual rehabilitation into heterosexuality, too.
[22:37:06] <zicada> culture changes over time, we cant blame people of the past for not knowing things we just figured out in the present
[22:37:29] <Ungwelian> In historical psychiatry, there's been consensus and massive wrongdoings. And it's all been "scientific" in the social order sense.
[22:37:29] <zicada> Ungwelian: yea therees scientific papers on anything
[22:37:57] <zicada> Ungwelian: scientific litteracy obv is about determining which papers and journals are likely to yeild useful results
[22:38:39] <Ungwelian> And sometimes about what agrees with what you like to agree with :P

[22:39:15] <Ungwelian> Especially if you're paid well. For example by Monsanto :P
[22:40:16] <Ungwelian> What I'm trying to say here, is that both religions and science are ideological systems that can be and are abused.
[22:40:41] <Ungwelian> And there are times when a priest is more right and a better person than a scientist.

[22:43:34] <Ungwelian> And that science is.
[22:43:45] <Ungwelian> Because it's all about people.
[22:46:02] <zicada> the whole point of science is to work against that human thing

[22:50:07] <Ungwelian> Much of that problem is that science is a capitalistic endeavour.
[22:50:09] <zicada> what does it mean that one person is published in a pay-journal and has 5 citations vs another being published in Nature and has 659 citations. It matters
[22:50:13] <zicada> both are scientific papers

[22:51:08] <zicada> if you already know, why pretend to look at data

[22:53:32] <Ungwelian> I'm still undecided on that point :)
[22:53:39] <Ungwelian> Rather like the idea that he was a Roman rebel.
[22:54:09] <zicada> Ungwelian: if we're not going to buy all this historical evidence as enough reason, we have to view a lot of other stuff in the same light
[22:54:42] <zicada> i think it should be relatively uncontroversial even, that a person who was named jesus existed about that time

[23:25:33] <zicada> hehe zolpidem

[23:26:07] <zicada> science has privided us with THC as well, from a mere plant, easily ingested without too much processing

[23:33:23] <Ungwelian> zicada, nothing against that, but not for me :)
[23:34:23] <Ungwelian> With luck, we'll have legalization in many countries within a few decades.

[23:41:12] <ro-bot-o> [url] One algorithm to rule decision-making | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft | www.mpg.de
[23:41:52] <I_Am_M00t> a bit of research on intelligence and AI
[23:42:06] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: maybe something you'd be interested in?
[23:43:05] <I_Am_M00t> they concluded that animals decide where to go based on binary decision making
[23:43:06] <zicada> yeah, interesting
[23:43:27] <zicada> reminds me of the Wolfram stuff at first glance
[23:44:33] <I_Am_M00t> wanna talk search algorithms? 🤓
[23:45:12] <zicada> not really, "solved" things arent that interesting, there are libs
[23:46:55] <I_Am_M00t> i mean the connection between them, and the finding in animals

[23:52:50] <zicada> i feel like at the end of the day its just layers of logic, and the more complex we make the logic the more we highfive eachother
[23:53:14] <zicada> "oh wow its so hard to make sense of this now, with this many layers wooow"
[23:53:35] <zicada> i mean, yeah, woow, but its layers of logic, its doing what its "supposed to"

[23:56:45] <zicada> presumably if general intelligence just sort of emerges when some system is complex enough, and we are constantly adding complexity, is the "chasm" between narrow and general AI even so wide
[23:58:53] <zicada> it cant be "just complexity" can it

[23:59:19] <zicada> its a particular kind of complexity, that gives rice to human brains that are capable of conciousness
