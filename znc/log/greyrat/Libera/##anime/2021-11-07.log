[00:05:20] <tcsilver> hi guys!
[00:05:45] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: World Trigger 3 | Episode: 5
[00:17:41] <emmeka> can anyone who does foss stuff explain something to me, a pleb
[00:17:51] <emmeka> ##anime is the appropriate place to ask these questions afterall
[00:18:09] <snake> Emmeka sup
[00:18:14] <snake> I am a bitcoin dev
[00:18:24] <snake> Front end tho
[00:18:36] <snake> Not advanced stuff like lukejr
[00:18:43] <snake> The catholic programmer
[00:19:54] <emmeka> so a keyboard layout I was going to try and install manually seems to have been added (committed?) to xkeyboard-config on github: https://github.com/freedesktop/xkeyboard-config/commit/61e71229654be138851292eca6bb8ff7a54473cd#diff-1ea50a8caf6085042452db60307ec62662e096120714ddac4fbc471c9456b411
[00:19:54] <ImoutoBot> [title] added altgr-weur,v 2.0 2021/04/12 11:27:12 adriaan in symbols/us and ¬∑ freedesktop/xkeyboard-config@61e7122 ¬∑ GitHub
[00:21:09] <emmeka> but like, does that mean I can expect it to just appear as an option in an update in my package manager soon, or what
[00:21:52] <snake> Hmm. Maybe itd be soon on gentoo but every distro is different
[00:22:14] <snake> You can check what version is prpvided in your distros package mananer
[00:22:37] <emmeka> snake right, I did, which brings me to another question. how do I even check what version that was added as of
[00:23:33] <snake> Looks like this project uses tags to identify versions
[00:26:09] <emmeka> oh. I see. well it's not even in a numbered version yet.
[00:26:14] <emmeka> I guess I'd be waiting a while
[00:26:29] <Berlin36> yo tcsilver
[00:26:33] <Berlin36> sorry, i was afk
[00:26:57] <Berlin36> not very hard syntaz
[00:26:58] <Berlin36> ,
[00:27:00] <Berlin36> x*
[00:27:45] <Berlin36> switch i { 
[00:27:46] <Berlin36> case 1:
[00:27:46] <Berlin36>     //code
[00:27:46] <Berlin36> default:
[00:27:56] <Berlin36> looks somehow like c++ switch
[00:28:10] <snake> Emmeka i cant see the change log bc im on mobile
[00:29:02] <snake> Nvm found it
[00:29:13] <snake> 2.35 or later i think
[00:30:29] <snake> Could be 2.34.xx
[00:30:41] <snake> But not 2.34.0
[00:31:09] <emmeka> dnf tells me I have xkeyboard-config 2.33-2, and that 2.34-1 is what's current in Rawhide. oh well.
[00:31:28] <snake> Prolly just gonna need to wait. Tho i wonder if you could downlod that change because it appears to just be configuration. 
[00:31:46] <emmeka> I could just do it myself, yes
[00:32:01] <emmeka> but am pleb, and will probably break things
[00:32:08] <snake> Config files typically indicate runtime configuration options. But it could be like code generation‚Ä¶ oh ok
[00:32:24] <snake> Didju try 2.34-1
[00:32:47] <emmeka> I mean, idk how. I'd have to add the rawhide repos?
[00:32:57] <emmeka> or compile it or something
[00:33:14] <snake> Oh ok idk what rawhide is
[00:33:39] <emmeka> Fedora's rolling release development version
[00:35:08] <snake> Ohh ok. Yeah. Im not sure about fedora world but i have two guesses
[00:35:40] <snake> Rawhide is a repo you can add. Or rawhide is like another ‚Äúspin‚Äù
[00:36:03] <snake> Could be smth else entirely tho good luck
[00:38:49] <emmeka> it'd probably be easier to just manually add the keyboard for now, but that might result in duplicates later, idk
[00:39:30] <emmeka> anyway, thanks. I just didn't really understand how to tell what version that'd be included in and what sort of timeframe to expect.

[00:58:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh was tehre Lisp devtalk?
[00:59:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > Clojure probably gets the most innovation these days, but, in many ways it's inferior to Common Lisp | A lot of Lisp's more advanced features are entirely missing, it's pretty much single-paradigm and its license sucks.
[01:00:30] <Urchin[emacs]> a lot of people are there fiddling with it, that's my point
[01:00:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Technically you cannot distribute GPL JVM Clojure code, as Clojure uses Apache without the compatibility exception.
[01:01:05] <snake> Davic when do u goto gymnasium agin
[01:01:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or rather, code is fine, but you cannot distribute builds.
[01:01:39] <davic> snake: never again
[01:01:40] <davic> why
[01:01:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In general Clojure was built to satisfy the needs of big data companies first.
[01:02:16] <davic> Aurora_v_kosmose: real men use elixir or erlang
[01:02:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> davic: Common Lisp is fine. And you forgot LFE.

[01:27:18] <MootPoot> In 2030 the radio will be a pure audio stream of advertisements

[01:57:43] <MootPoot> yes but like
[01:57:57] <MootPoot> where is the overlap between people who listen to radio and iphone owners
[01:58:21] <Bco1981> you're right.

[01:59:56] <MootPoot> idk

[02:00:39] <Bco1981> use bluetooth and music from the phone
[02:00:42] <MootPoot> ^
[02:00:45] <MootPoot> podcasts
[02:00:50] <emmeka> yes, and.
[02:01:11] <MootPoot> podcast+phone music > radio
[02:01:15] <emmeka> are you questioning whether people still listen to broadcast fm radio in their car instead of streaming it
[02:01:19] <MootPoot> yes
[02:01:36] <emmeka> ok, well, I'm not sure why I have to explain this, but people still listen to radios
[02:01:42] <emmeka> which is generally why all cars come with them
[02:01:52] <tcsilver> me too!
[02:02:03] <Jigsy> Radio = boomer tech.
[02:02:06] <Jigsy> -Some zoomer, probably.
[02:02:09] <MootPoot> they like listening to 80% ads?
[02:02:19] <emmeka> sounds like you need a better radio station
[02:02:32] * Jigsy only listens to Japanese radio.
[02:02:36] * Jigsy holds up a wine glass.
[02:02:45] <emmeka> but no they probably like listening to a mix of content that includes music, local news, local weather, local traffic, without having to curate that
[02:02:49] <tcsilver> jigsy japanese radio is great!
[02:02:53] <tcsilver> xm!
[02:02:53] <tcsilver> :D
[02:02:56] <emmeka> which is basically the entire purpose of modern day radio
[02:03:02] <emmeka> but again, why am I explaining this
[02:03:03] <Jigsy> I'm still sad my favorite personality left.
[02:03:04] <Jigsy> ;_;
[02:03:12] <tcsilver> ah
[02:03:13] <emmeka> I'm amazed that this isn't self-evident to you
[02:03:35] <MootPoot> auto curation is already a feature on most streaming apps tho
[02:03:36] <MootPoot> idk
[02:03:53] <MootPoot> it just never occured to me people actually use those things for anything other then work
[02:04:13] <MootPoot> or if you're out in the boonies with no signal I get it
[02:05:25] <MootPoot> do you get radio on the great lakes
[02:05:35] <MootPoot> just normal radio , not marine comms

[04:12:11] <MootPoot> by almost I mean I had 20g of carbs from a snack bar before going to the grocery store
[04:12:13] <ButterNoodle> you have to eat keto for days
[04:12:20] <MootPoot> how many days
[04:12:40] <ButterNoodle> 7-14
[04:12:46] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[04:12:52] <ButterNoodle> are u just doing low carb?
[04:12:56] <ButterNoodle> thats a thing too
[04:13:10] <MootPoot> what's the cutoff between low carb and keto
[04:13:16] <MootPoot> is keto like legit 0 carb
[04:13:56] *** Joins: fox (~finn@uwyo-129-72-151-5.uwyo.edu)
[04:14:10] <ButterNoodle> low carb is edging ur metabolism on input calories and lowered carbs.. it still works like it did before. its traditional starvation to lose/maintain weight
[04:14:56] <ButterNoodle> lower than low carb and adding fat is keto.. ur reprogramming ur metabolism to work like emmeka's people and process fat for energy instead of carbs
[04:15:12] <ButterNoodle> starting out.. u shouldnt do more than 20 per day

[04:21:25] <ButterNoodle> thats mostly water weight
[04:21:46] <MootPoot> 15kg?
[04:21:50] <MootPoot> thats crazy
[04:21:52] <ButterNoodle> yea
[04:22:05] <ButterNoodle> I dumped 10kg the first month
[04:22:15] <MootPoot> I'm like 40kg overweight - even 10kg or so will be a massive deal to me
[04:22:28] <MootPoot> in terms of general feeling 
[04:22:44] <ButterNoodle> took another 1 1/2 year to dump another 10

[10:18:54] <ButterNoodle> give ur stomach herpes
[10:19:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hm... it might be fine if you change the water heating setting to something high-enough to sterilize.
[10:19:05] <Sadale> potatoxel[m], what?
[10:19:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But the average heater is capped <70C, which is far too low.

[10:19:54] <ButterNoodle> they are not
[10:20:13] <ButterNoodle> but u need 100+c and pressure to kill everything
[10:20:13] <Sadale> I think rubbing alcohol could be used as well.
[10:20:19] <ButterNoodle> its shit
[10:20:21] <Sadale> wut?
[10:20:24] <Sadale> really?
[10:20:36] <ButterNoodle> its a disinfectant not a steralizer
[10:20:37] <Sadale> I thought that rubbing alcohol kills everything
[10:20:43] <ButterNoodle> no way
[10:20:43] <Sadale> oh what's the difference?
[10:21:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not aware of any reliable oven sterilization process. Usually a pressure cooker is how you homebrew it.
[10:21:08] <ButterNoodle> betadine is better than alcohol for cleaning
[10:21:29] <ButterNoodle> there is some dry heat sterilization processes
[10:21:48] <ButterNoodle> but thats used for bandages and single use contact stuff
[10:21:51] <ButterNoodle> and its still shit
[10:22:07] <ButterNoodle> heat and pressure is the only reliable method
[10:22:15] <ButterNoodle> or heat pressure and chemicals
[10:22:42] <Sadale> I see. I didn't know that
[10:22:52] <potatoxel[m]> im a tomato
[10:23:24] <ButterNoodle> I may be remembering incorrectly.. but some pathogens, like viruses have such a hard cell wall that you need at least 10PSI plus the temp to crush them
[10:23:33] <ButterNoodle> *might be more psi
[10:24:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Non pressurized water doesn't get hot enough to sterilize.
[10:24:01] <ButterNoodle> I dont own an autoclave anymore
[10:24:14] <Sadale> scary
[10:24:16] <ButterNoodle> yea it just turns to vapor and does nothing
[10:24:22] <Sadale> would the virus just decompose after sitting a while?
[10:24:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Dry heat can be done, at lowest, via 150C over 150 minuets.
[10:24:54] <ButterNoodle> I wouldnt trust dry heat on any blood borne pathogens
[10:25:28] <MootPoot> I prefer the wet heat of a virgin onee-san manko
[10:25:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: It should work just fine. I strongly suspect the toys would be too destroyed/burnt by the process for it to matter anyway
[10:25:34] <ButterNoodle> I wouldnt mind getting another autoclave tbh

[10:25:57] <Sadale> lol screw it let's get new sex toy instead
[10:26:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: Pretty much.
[10:26:14] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: if we are still talking about sex toys.. then just like most stuff, its not feasible to sterilize
[10:26:15] <MootPoot> get a gun safe and fill it with sex toys like I do
[10:26:29] <ButterNoodle> nice
[10:26:38] <ButterNoodle> I put mine in my server cabinet
[10:26:42] <ButterNoodle> it keeps them warm
[10:26:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Yup.
[10:27:12] <Sadale> I'm sure that there's gonna be a way to sterilize sex toy. But the process may be too time-consuming that I'd rather to get new sex toy
[10:27:21] <Sadale> oh wait. What if new sex toys are contaminated as well?
[10:27:23] <ButterNoodle> dont put them in ur gun cabinet.. ur adding moisture that could cause rust

[10:59:37] <MootPoot> for 600 could put together a ryzen 5000 APU mini ITX box 
[11:01:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/smart/fat/ client
[11:02:13] <MootPoot> can you build stuff for ARM using an x86 box?
[11:02:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: If you play around with $HOME/.local/share/apps/ XDG Application definitions (perhaps script-generated), you could have dmenu/rofi/whatever present software options that would actually call them over Xpra/network and run them from the remote.
[11:02:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yes, that's called cross-compiling.
[11:03:54] <MootPoot> I COULD just order a 4gb raspi and set it up ...but he's a bit meh on that  idea - I told him its probably best if youwant to do any actual linux work to abandon the gui
[11:04:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Meh, that's too pessimistic. i3wm or sway would run just fine.
[11:05:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But shit like firefox & chrome will feel tight in 4gb.
[11:05:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you're calling them over Xpra from a larger machine though, it'll be fine.
[11:06:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh and of course forget compiling a lot of C++ & Rust on a 4Gb machine
[11:07:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Anyway, gotta get some chores done.

[18:10:02] * Berlin36 fucking dies
[18:10:14] <snake> you didnt know go had pointers?
[18:10:21] <amigojapan> snake: I don't want to get up one hour earlier. I refuse
[18:10:23] <Berlin36> i knew it had pointers
[18:10:37] <Berlin36> i just hoped ill never come across them
[18:10:38] <Berlin36> lol
[18:10:43] <snake> oh ok lol
[18:10:45] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Tesla Note | Episode: 6
[18:10:46] <snake> no they're common
[18:10:52] <Berlin36> yeah:(
[18:11:04] <snake> did you see the code i sent you? it was imperfect but it showed general layout of an ADT bag
[18:11:14] <Berlin36> when
[18:11:18] <snake> amigojapan, this time of year we gain an hour of sleep
[18:11:46] <snake> Berlin36, i will reupload it, i made it better since then anyways
[18:11:54] <Berlin36> oh nice
[18:12:11] <amigojapan> snake: I am on with that. But will not accept the opposite
[18:12:17] <Berlin36> "unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic"
[18:12:22] <Berlin36> is that a bad thing? ^
[18:13:26] <snake> Berlin36, its fine
[18:13:34] <snake> i mean its not necessary
[18:13:38] <Duns_Scrotus> No but pointer arithmetic was fun :(
[18:13:40] <snake> but you could imagine using it
[18:13:43] <Berlin36> oh okay
[18:13:48] <Berlin36> but what does it do
[18:13:59] <snake> array + 0 is the first element of an array in C
[18:14:06] <snake> array + 1 is the 2nd element
[18:14:26] <Berlin36> ye
[18:14:32] <snake> oh i think you need to use sizeof array too
[18:14:33] <Duns_Scrotus> Berlin36: In C, if you type the name of an array, it transparently is converted into a pointer to the array‚Äôs first element
[18:15:10] <Berlin36> wh-
[18:15:13] <snake> array + 1 * sizeof array[0]
[18:15:16] <Duns_Scrotus> So you can do for ptr = arr; ptr < arr + Len; ptr++
[18:15:27] <snake> yeah ty duns
[18:15:29] <Duns_Scrotus> To loop through the elements of an array
[18:15:59] <Duns_Scrotus> Arrays aren‚Äôt really values in C
[18:16:00] <snake> an array is contiguous in memory so you can just iterate by incrementing the pointer
[18:16:20] <Berlin36> ooooh
[18:16:31] <Berlin36> right
[18:16:34] <Duns_Scrotus> you can‚Äôt assign an array to a variable, there‚Äôs no expression that evaluates to an array
[18:16:48] <Duns_Scrotus> C just has pointers
[18:16:48] <snake> amigojapan, yeah sleep feels good, i understand what you mean
[18:17:04] <snake> and primitives
[18:17:23] <Berlin36> i've just read a tutorialspoint article about pointers arithmetic and kinda understood it
[18:17:27] <snake> but the array is allocated onto the stack or heap (or whatever)
[18:17:56] <Duns_Scrotus> Berlin36: in a computer, every byte in memory gets its own address
[18:18:00] <amigojapan> snake: I don't even use an alarm clock
[18:18:24] <Duns_Scrotus> And the address is basically just a uint64
[18:18:49] <Duns_Scrotus> Used to be a uint32 before 64 bit processors
[18:18:50] <Berlin36> isn't it uint8
[18:18:54] <Duns_Scrotus> No
[18:19:09] <Duns_Scrotus> A uint8 can only go from 0 to 255
[18:19:20] <Berlin36> oh i was thinking about the byte data type in go
[18:19:34] <Berlin36> which is an alias for uint8 i think
[18:19:37] <Duns_Scrotus> And your computer has more than 256 bytes of memory
[18:19:49] <Duns_Scrotus> Yeah, a byte is an 8 bit number
[18:20:06] <snake> the address of a byte is a 64 bit number
[18:20:08] <Duns_Scrotus> And your computer‚Äôs memory holds a few  dozen billion of them
[18:20:23] <Duns_Scrotus> Which is why you need a 64 bit number to address them
[18:20:38] *** Joins: hans (~hans@36.84-48-255.nextgentel.com)
[18:21:19] <Duns_Scrotus> and the way your cpu reads from memory is, roughly
[18:21:19] <amigojapan> Berlin36: we only switched to 64 bits so we could address more then 4gb of ram
[18:21:24] <snake> amigojapan, its usually easy to wake up earlier during the jump forward
[18:21:37] <snake> amigojapan, since it gets hotter and brighter out
[18:21:48] <snake> the sun shines thru my window and i basically have to get up
[18:22:16] <Duns_Scrotus> ‚ÄúYou see this 64 bit number in this register of yours? It‚Äôs actually a memory address. Now go read the 8 bytes starting at this address into another register, and those 8 bytes are another 64 bit number‚Äù
[18:22:35] <amigojapan> snake: I get up when I am not sleepy anymore
[18:22:42] <Duns_Scrotus> which is what happens when you do *ptr
[18:23:03] <snake> yeah most people aren't sleepy when the sun is shining in their face
[18:23:26] <Duns_Scrotus> a sunny park is the best place for a nap
[18:23:35] <amigojapan> snake: typically I sleep still 12 noon
[18:23:44] <snake> Duns_Scrotus, that sounds like a T **ptr
[18:23:46] <amigojapan> Till
[18:24:54] <hans> amigojapan, it's also easy to do 64bit math now; sure it's technically possible to do 64bit math on 32bit cpus, but it's much slower than 64bit cpus, having to emulate a 64bit integer with 2x 32bit integers~
[18:24:58] <snake> amigojapan, doesnt that cause diabetes?
[18:25:05] <amigojapan> Ok I am going to sleep now guys, see you guys tomorrow

[22:26:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Depending on the programs though, MOSH might be more appropriate.
[22:43:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Being that I don't quite trust MOSH to be as secure as SSH, I'd use WireGuard as a transport. It's UDP-based as well so it shouldn't cause issues.
[22:44:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That makes MOSH's roaming support redundant, but who cares, the latency support is the reason to use it.

[23:08:43] <DPA> Could someone recommend an anime to me. I've already seen quiet a few, so I'm probably looking fore somewhat obscure ones now. It should bring something new to the table an not just copy the usual tropes.
[23:08:44] <DPA> Ideally, it should have some unique dynamics, physics, circumstances, things, etc. and roll with it, following it's own logic. What if water flowed upwards. What if people lived under water. Anything, but new, different, unusual.
[23:08:44] <DPA> It should also have some action, mystery, suspense, or at least not too slow pacing.

[23:14:03] <JesseDesu> i worked on that piece for 16 hours
[23:14:20] <DPA> how deep down the rabbithole? As far as possible, I think. Although I may not know what I get myself into ;)
[23:14:25] <emmeka> DPA because like I don't see Evangelion, Utena, Lain, those kind of shows on your list.
[23:14:37] <emmeka> which are classics, very esoteric and symbolic, sort of out there
[23:14:51] <JesseDesu> have you seen little nemo
[23:17:24] <emmeka> DPA but as far as shows specifically with "rules of the world working differently, following its own logic", Sonny Boy, Patema Inverted... maybe Tatami Galaxy
[23:17:56] <DPA> I tended to skip things which are have mecha, much drama, or are very long. But maybe I can give some of the ones you mentioned a try.
[23:17:57] <ButterNoodle> patema
[23:18:10] <ButterNoodle> I remember the visuals being pretty stunning
[23:18:12] <ButterNoodle> and a cute girl

[23:22:56] <DPA> I think I'll try "Nagi no Asu Kara", and then maybe "Sonny Boy", for a start. Thanks everyone.

[23:23:57] <ButterNoodle> thats another top tier one
[23:24:01] <emmeka> hypo7r7_ uhhhhh so half of humanity is born with their gravity inverted, they live "underground", and if they come to the "surface" they fall into the sky and die. there's a surface people with normal gravity that oppress the underground people.
