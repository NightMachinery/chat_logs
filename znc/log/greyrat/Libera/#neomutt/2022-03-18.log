[13:50:41] <flatcap> morning all
[13:51:33] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[13:53:36] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[13:57:28] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[13:59:30] <gahr> thanks for the latest fix :)
[13:59:59] <gahr> so much better to see messages going through than staring at a stale screen
[14:02:41] <flatcap> np
[14:03:03] <flatcap> sometime soon, I need to review all the refreshes
[14:03:45] <flatcap> with the exception of designated "event loops", there should be very few of them
[14:04:32] <flatcap> I'd also like to (nearly) eliminate SigWinch...
[14:05:47] <flatcap> I'm trying to work out if mutt_getch() emits a Window event, if that'll be enough
[14:06:20] <flatcap> i.e.  are there any places where we pause in the code, but *aren't* waiting for a keypress

[16:12:06] <dcpurton> flatcap: how would you feel about slightly changing the logic of `next-page`
[16:12:09] <dcpurton> ?
[16:12:31] <dcpurton> (at least for how it runs in the index - haven't thought about other contexts)
[16:13:27] <dcpurton> at present if the bottom message is visible and you run `next-page` this message is put at the top of the page as the only visible message in the window
[16:14:16] <dcpurton> I reckon it would be nicer to check if the last message is visible on screen and if it is then just move the indicator to the last message rather than change the whole view
[16:14:18] <flatcap> hmm... it's something I've noticed, but not really thought about...
[16:14:42] <dcpurton> that doesn't seem terribly clear to me having explained it...
[16:14:49] <dcpurton> but maybe you get what i mean
[16:14:57] <flatcap> yes
[16:15:10] <flatcap> there are quite a few config variables that affect the menu movement
[16:15:32] <flatcap> so it may be tricky to satisfy them all
[16:15:37] <dcpurton> ah
[16:16:01] <flatcap> but please investigate and start asking questions
[16:16:21] <dcpurton> I can have a look and see what happens
[16:16:26] <flatcap> great
[16:16:27] <dcpurton> Obviously not a major issue
[16:17:00] <dcpurton> I just find I often use page-up and page-down and then find I have one message left on screen
[16:17:38] <flatcap> there $menu_context (so something) that's equivalent to vim's `scrolloff`
[16:17:51] <flatcap> s/\<so\>/or/
[16:18:05] <flatcap> it keeps a minimum number of items on screen
[16:18:25] <dcpurton> oh yeah - that might suit me enough
[16:18:55] <dcpurton> There's too many config options I know noting about
[16:18:57] <flatcap> and there's an option to *scroll* rather than *page* when you hit the top/bottom
[16:19:02] <flatcap> hehe, me too :-)
[16:22:43] <dcpurton> maybe `set menu_move_off = no` suits me
[16:23:48] * flatcap has to look that up
[16:24:10] <flatcap> ah!
[16:24:27] <dcpurton> nah - don't like it
[16:24:32] <dcpurton> let me try the context option
[16:24:32] <flatcap> :-)
[16:27:22] <dcpurton> hmm. don't like menu_scroll with menu_context
[16:27:52] <dcpurton> menu_context by itself is *ok* but still creates that unnecessary jump
[16:28:16] <dcpurton> I shall think about it
[16:28:39] <flatcap> ok
[16:34:52] <flatcap> bookworm: did you get around to any neo-bot improvements?
[17:07:28] * dcpurton discovers header caching ðŸ˜²
[17:08:12] <flatcap> oh!  it's kinda helpful :-)
[17:09:30] <dcpurton> I think I've just been running off the Debian defaults for too long
[17:09:57] <dcpurton> and looking at the config options, I don't think they have been changed in a while
[17:13:39] * flatcap wonders: if we defaulted the header cache to 'on', where would we save the data?
[17:15:06] <dcpurton> ~/.cache/neomutt/hcache
[17:15:25] <dcpurton> (folder)
[17:16:01] <dcpurton> or just ~/.cache/neomutt/ I guess
[17:17:26] <Kinnison> well, `xdg-cache-home`/neomutt/...
[17:17:33] <Kinnison> for whatever mechanism you have to read XDG dirs
[17:17:49] <dcpurton> yes, that is better
[17:18:11] <Kinnison> that's where I have them go :D
[17:18:48] <flatcap> yeah, which would fit in nicely with #3125
[17:18:49] <neo-bot> PR by @darrel-glud "Support XDG Base Directory Specification ... a little more": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3125
[17:20:02] <dcpurton> Debian uses tokyocabinet, but from https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/master/contrib/hcache-bench it seems lmdb is faster
[17:21:13] <dcpurton> can you have both enabled?
[17:21:33] <dcpurton> I guess not actually
[17:22:04] <dcpurton> hmmm. I can live with the config error when I run the system version of Neomutt
[17:22:10] <flatcap> yes, and choose one using set header_cache_backend
[17:23:26] <flatcap> yes, lmdb is a good choice
[17:24:16] <flatcap> the hcache backends write to separate files, so it's safe to switch between them
[17:24:40] <dcpurton> I mean that if I have `set header_cache_backend = lmdb` then System Neomutt complains of unknown backend.
[17:24:49] <dcpurton> good to know that it's safe to switch between
[17:25:00] <dcpurton> (that is another question)
[17:25:41] <flatcap> hmm... there's an `ifdef` command, but it doesn't know about hcache backends
[17:26:13] <flatcap> iirc, ifdef knows about versions
[17:26:18] <dcpurton> doesn't matter really. I just run System Neomutt occasionaly as a quick way to see behaviour at last stable release
[17:26:27] <dcpurton> I *could* rebuild
[17:26:32] <flatcap> so you _might_ be able to ifdef OLD_VERSION commands
[17:27:05] <dcpurton> so I wouldn't bother fixing anything
[17:27:06] <gahr> < flatcap> the hcache backends write to separate files, so it's safe to switch between them
[17:27:09] <gahr> mh...
[17:27:11] <gahr> do they?
[17:27:58] <dcpurton> haha
[17:28:49] <flatcap> aren't the filenames the hash of backend + account/mailbox name?
[17:29:33] <gahr> account yes, backend doesn't ring a bell
[17:30:43] <flatcap> I think we added that because multiple backends would write to [large hex number] and get upset if reading from someone else's
[17:32:43] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/hcache/hcache.c#L302
