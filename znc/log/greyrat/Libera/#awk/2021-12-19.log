[23:07:23] <nmz1> /[^:]/ no work?
[23:25:32] <mknod> # printf '%s\n' . : | awk '/[^:]/'
[23:25:33] <shbot> mknod: .
[23:25:42] <mknod> Looks like it does.
[23:26:38] <mknod> It matches any non ":" in the string. So it will probably succeed on most strings.
[23:30:15] <nmz1> seems like it doesn't to me
[23:31:58] <nmz1> ; ls  | awk '/[^:]/' | grep : | sed 1q
[23:32:00] <nmz1> Alt Shift X Podcast:#3_ All Tomorrows creator C. M. Kösemen.opus
[23:33:04] <nmz1> ; ls  | awk '/[^:]/' | grep : | wc -l
[23:33:06] <nmz1> 129
[23:36:41] <nmz1> doesn't even pretend to work
[23:37:11] <nmz1> oh
[23:37:15] <nmz1> it actually matches :
[23:37:22] <nmz1> [^:] is /:/
[23:37:33] <nmz1> weirdo buggo
[23:40:41] <yeti> # mawk '[^:]' <<< 'I need more caffeine?'

[23:41:33] <yeti> yip
[23:41:39] <yeti> undercaffeinated
[23:41:41] <yeti> definitely
[23:41:44] <yeti> o:-)
[23:41:51] <nmz1> forgot the //
[23:41:56] <yeti> yip
[23:42:17] <yeti> "[^:] is /:/" <<< took that too literally
[23:42:23] <nmz1> maybe busybox works
[23:43:09] <yeti> $ busybox awk '/[^:]/' <<< 'I need more caffeine?'
[23:43:11] <yeti> I need more caffeine?
[23:43:17] <yeti> \o/
[23:43:18] <nmz1> I must be missing something
[23:43:21] <nmz1> how do you do this
[23:43:41] <nmz1> still fails for me
[23:44:29] <nmz1> # busybox awk '/[^:]/' <<< 'WTF with Marc Maron Podcast:Episode 1277 - Felipe Esparza.opus'
[23:44:30] <shbot> nmz1: bash: busybox: command not found

[23:44:54] <nmz1> maybe
[23:45:40] <nmz1> grep -v works at least
[23:45:56] <yeti> $ gawk '/[^:]/' <<< 'I need more: caffeine?'
[23:45:58] <yeti> I need more: caffeine?
[23:46:23] <yeti> matches everything?  even ":"s?
[23:46:34] <nmz1> ya
[23:46:44] <nmz1> is this a regex thing?
[23:46:54] <nmz1> I'll ask on #regex
[23:49:08] <nmz1> ah, I'm dumb
[23:49:11] <nmz1> I need caffeine
[23:49:20] <nmz1> sorry yeti 
[23:49:52] * yeti still wits for the 1st caffein to kick in
[23:49:56] <nmz1> this is what I get for dropping caffeine
[23:50:13] <yeti> so still a bit in low power mode
[23:50:56] <nmz1> I needed to use /^[^:]+$/
[23:51:10] <yeti> everything not :
[23:51:23] * nmz1 facepalm
[23:51:27] <nmz1> sorry for bothering everyone
[23:51:28] * yeti too
[23:51:39] <yeti> heute lange leitung
[23:51:39] <nmz1> you idc about ;P
[23:52:36] * nmz1 goes to google translate
[23:53:01] <yeti> https://hive-project.de/board/download/file.php?id=1156
[23:53:12] <emanuele6> /^[^:]*$/ can be written !/:/
[23:53:20] <nmz1> I kno
[23:53:49] * yeti raises the the pot with the caffeine soup:  skøl!
[23:54:03] <yeti> doping
[23:54:23] <emanuele6> souping
[23:54:43] <yeti> Use the soup, Luke!
[23:55:33] * nmz1 injects some soup
