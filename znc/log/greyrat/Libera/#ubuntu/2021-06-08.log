[00:41:33] <ogra> Nitrigaur, if you call it from a terminal you could probably chain the commands in usual shell manner like: cmd1 && cmd2 && cdm3
[00:42:32] <Nitrigaur> ogra, true, but I do not call it from a terminal, it's an automated process that prevents me from shutting down my computer.
[00:42:50] *** ghostcube_ is now known as ghostcube
[00:43:01] <ogra> Nitrigaur, though note that using "sudo shutdown" will likely not work because the sudo token will have timed out when mdadm is done ... so first doing "sudo -s" to get an actual root shell, then your mdadm command and then appending && shutdown should work
[00:43:08] <ogra> oh
[00:44:01] <ogra> i suspect there is no toggle for this anyhere

[00:46:18] <sarnold> Nitrigaur: can you spot the difference between rebuilding and not rebuilding in /proc/mdstat?
[00:46:50] <sarnold> Nitrigaur: if so a while true ; do sleep 30 ; grep something /proc/mdstat && shutdown -h now ; done   kind of loop might do the trick

[01:34:40] <ogra> gneeriiloeepdeer, there is surely a bug somewhere ... or a misconfiguration ... either way we wont know if it is something systemic or a htop bug if you dont run the top command once to compare

[02:55:41] <tomreyn> KS3: you chose to remove several grub packages, and to destroy / remove their configurations as well:

[02:55:51] <B0g4r7> Things I install via snap can't access the filesystem normally.  Wanna use the "export to csv" function?  Too bad.
[02:55:52] <ogra> saves a lot of space, keeps them reaonly and tinker proof
[02:56:14] <tomreyn> KS3: and then you decided (?) to install all of these packages:
[02:56:16] <tomreyn> grub-common grub-efi-amd64 grub-efi-amd64-bin grub-efi-amd64-signed grub2-common os-prober grub-efi
[02:56:44] <ogra> B0g4r7, did you report that to the  developer of that snap ?
[02:57:04] <B0g4r7> I installed the Chromium snap.  Chromium would run for a while, and then after maybe a day the tabs would stop working.  It would say "oh snap, something went wrong."  I uninstalled it and installed the apt version and the problem went away.

[04:08:33] <kandinski> I'm trying to start barrier/synergy under gdm3, following a modified recipe (using barrier from snap): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynergyHowto with this at the end of /etc/gdm3/Init/Default: https://termbin.com/ik28

[04:08:37] <kandinski> I've edited /etc/gdm3/custom.conf to ensure gdm runs on X (because barrier doesn't work on
[04:08:40] <kandinski> Wayland).
[04:08:43] <kandinski> The result is that my user does start with a barrier client (whether I log in using gdm to authorise or automatically), but I can't access gdm over barrier. I'd appreciate tips on how to debug. I don't know how to find out for instance which Xdisplay gdm3 is using, so I can add the right --display switch to the barrier.barrierc command.

[11:54:17] <mgedmin> the PAM configuration for ecryptfs-utils does two things: (1) automount the Private directory on login, if you use a password to log in

[11:54:52] *** Quits: SnowWhite (~SnowWhite@user/snowwhite) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[11:55:05] <mgedmin> there's no way PAM could cause a slow unmount
[11:55:48] <RupertEverton> the slow unmount was really the secondary issue tho, i was mostly concerned with the slow and inconsistent mount
[11:55:50] <mgedmin> maybe some applications were keeping files open inside ~/Private (tracker indexer?  but isn't Private excluded from desktop indexing by default)
[11:56:13] <mgedmin> the slow mount is more interesting, and it would be helpful to see what's going on in journalctl if you reproduce it

[12:26:15] <mgedmin> nothing should be randomly removing keys from the kernel keyring

[16:57:07] <mgedmin> yes-ish
[16:57:23] <mgedmin> I wouldn't touch APT::Default-Release, it'll cause pain on upgrades
[16:58:08] <mgedmin> the other bit, /etc/apt/preferences, is the thing I mentioned earlier
[16:58:11] <bailsman> I want to install prometheus-node-exporter from Groovy so that I can use tls. But that is the only package I want to pull/update from groovy. I realize that this is 100% at my own risk and there is a decent chance cross release packages won't even work at all or malfunction in weird ways.
[16:58:19] <mgedmin> https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/impish/en/man5/apt_preferences.5.html
[16:58:43] <mgedmin> finding a ppa that backports the thing you want is better
[16:58:51] <mgedmin> if there's no ppa you can try to create one and do the backport yourself
[16:59:33] *** Quits: dbasinge (~dbasinge@ubuntu/member/dbasinge) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[17:00:06] <mgedmin> all you need is pull-lp-source prometheus-node-exporter groovy; cd prometheus-node-exporter-*; dch -i and adjust the version number to be same as in groovy with a ~ubuntu20.04 suffix (assuming you're backporting to focal) and set the release to focal
[17:00:19] <mgedmin> then debuild -i -S, cd .., dput *.changes
[17:00:43] <mgedmin> oh and you need to have a gpg key associated with your launchpad account and a ppa created in launchpad
[17:01:21] <mgedmin> and I omitted the ppa:yourname/ppa argument from dput
[17:01:22] <bailsman> Thing is that I don't want to watch prometheus github, if there's a security issue or anything, I want it to auto update or at least flag that there's an update. If it breaks completely after the update, that's fine, maybe I'll rebuild it myself the.n
[17:01:37] <mgedmin> well, hmm
[17:01:41] <Guest8240> why ubuntu still doesn't fully encrypt the disk including /boot yet?

[17:10:09] <Guest8240> mgedmin renderer in netplan should be netowrkd or networkmanager?
[17:10:57] <mgedmin> it depends on which one you use

[17:11:49] <bailsman> It actually worked in Docker! Does that mean this ISNT a major footgun? Also: don't I need the default release, even though it messes with upgrades, just to make sure I don't accidentally upgrade another package?
[17:12:06] <bailsman> Is there an apt preferences only method? I did the pinning for prometheus-node-exporter
[17:13:26] <mgedmin> you pin everything in groovy to some very low priority like -1, and then pin prometheus-node-exporter to something higher than the default pin (which is 500)

[18:51:16] <magic_ninja> tomreyn, no, it is a usb webcam.
[18:51:26] <tomreyn> if not, just pull the usb cable and reconnect it, maybe to a different usb port.
[18:51:46] <magic_ninja> is there a way to reset a usb port via software?

[21:08:55] <jpmh> I have a USB connected Raspberry Pi on my Ubuntu laptop.  The laptop is and needs to be connected to wifi, sometimes 10. network, sometimes 192.168 types, depending on the coffee shop  I am in.  When I do an ip a, each device does see the other.  The pi has a 16.254 local address for the usb.  In order to connect the two though I have a problem.  dhcp allocated a 10. address to my wifi, but no address to my usb0 device.  I can force
[21:08:55] <jpmh> dhcp to do that with dhcpcd but then I lose access to my wifi.  How should I be doing this.  I would add that the Pi too has wifi.  When I do use dhcpcd on the Ubuntu machine I can indeed connect to pi.local

[23:40:25] <jeremy31> bumblefuzz: > sudo iwconfig wlp0s20f3 power off
[23:40:56] <bumblefuzz> will that not shut off my wifi?
[23:41:15] <jeremy31> bumblefuzz: no, just disable power management, change the router to channel 6

[23:42:00] <oerheks> ratrace, no
[23:42:00] <bumblefuzz> and the first command?
[23:42:03] <bumblefuzz> swcrypto?

[23:42:26] <oerheks> basicly for any ubuntu version.
[23:42:30] <jeremy31> bumblefuzz: According to an archlinux thread, that might fix it
[23:42:40] <ratrace> oerheks: k, thanks
[23:42:40] <Unit193> Huh, didn't know that one.
[23:42:44] <oerheks> all you need is to add universe probably
[23:43:00] <oerheks> Unit193, found @ https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2455131
[23:43:38] <Unit193> I use deb822 formatting, so it'd be different.  But that's great, I'll have to remember that if someone else asks.

[23:54:38] <bumblefuzz> ?
[23:55:05] <jeremy31> bumblefuzz: That swcrypto doesn't take effect until a reboot
[23:55:18] *** Joins: jadi (~jadi@185.135.228.234)
[23:55:23] <bumblefuzz> and what does that do exactly?
[23:56:07] <jeremy31> enables software encryption if I remember

[23:57:29] <bumblefuzz> and reboot?
[23:57:42] <jeremy31> 11n_disable=1 actually disables wifi-n, =8 enables agressive TX, reboot
