[00:01:00] <djacobs> Can it be that running ./manage.py test is failing to see the actual models of the application?

[00:01:33] <djacobs> cause i've noticed that upon running ./manage makemigrations/migrate he also doesn't detect the database!

[00:17:02] <leElvyn> Hi, i have a simple nullable foreignKey in my model, but django admin is requiring it, so, why is that, and how can i fix that ?
[00:18:30] <GinFuyou> djacobs, test use a test db by default. But it should work close to what a production project should be
[00:18:47] <GinFuyou> leElvyn, have you set blank=True?

[00:19:50] <leElvyn> No, let me try that
[00:19:55] <leElvyn> why should it be ?
[00:20:59] <leElvyn> ok, thanks !

[00:24:48] <GinFuyou> null=True makes field nullable in DB, blank=True refers to how django forms behave.
[00:24:58] <nedbat> if I have the wrong password for my database, why would .save() silently succeed anyway?
[00:25:08] <leElvyn> ok, thanks
[00:25:26] <GinFuyou> nedbat, no you shouldn't be able to start you project at all
[00:26:05] <GinFuyou> may probably depend if you have uncommon backend\driver
[00:26:33] <nedbat> GinFuyou: this is with mysql, but i didn't have my router defined, so...?
[00:26:50] <moldy> nedbat: pretty sure you should get an error on connecting to the database
[00:26:55] <nedbat> GinFuyou: it's failing better now :)
