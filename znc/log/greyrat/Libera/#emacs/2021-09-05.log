[00:03:27] <gxt> Oh and while I was at first pleasantly surprised that system clipboard integration works out of the box for pasting with C-y, I am now very often annoyed when I copy in another program and then delete something in emacs before yanking, as the clipboard is not put on the kill ring, so I have to go back and copy the text again.

[00:17:23] <gxt> One other minor annoyance that is inhibiting my editing (because I haven't learned the right way yet) is searching and replacing. In Vim I would often search for e.g. "foo" with /foo<Enter>, then step through results with n, then for example replace one instance via cebar<Esc> (change to end of word, insert "bar", leave insert mode), and from then I could replace selectively, e.g. nnn.n.nn.n.nnn.

[00:50:32] <gxt> To be honest, from a newbie perspective, it feels like in emacs every intricate operation has its own command, which a lot of the time is not bound and only available with M-x by default. While in Vim intricate operations are usually composed of orthogonal building block commands that can each be reused in several separate contexts.

[02:02:54] <euouae> oh okay, I actually have no idea about that. I don't know how to highlight text, wouldn't you have to use a function for that? Does Emacs have any?

[02:33:43] <johnjay> fill-paragraph shouldn't be inserting characters
[02:33:50] <johnjay> so it's probably a mode you have enabled in your init
[02:33:59] <johnjay> ,bisect
[02:34:00] <fsbot> johnjay, bisect is [0] If you can reproduce your issue reliably in a new emacs, try bisecting your user-init-file
[02:34:00] <fsbot> [1] Comment out lower half of your init file and try to reproduce the issue. Recurse as needed.
[02:34:00] <fsbot> [2] Use M-; to comment or uncomment selected region
[02:34:00] <fsbot> [3] See also ,keep-one-open
[02:34:13] <johnjay> using .emacs is useful for that because it overrides init.el
[02:34:31] <johnjay> so simply copy half of init.el to .emacs see if it does it and keep going until you reproduce it

[14:40:29] <Fernando-Basso> I have always used both vim and emacs, each to program in certain languages. A few months ago, I started being in a situation that I have two or three different projects open at the same time, one of them being my org-mode personal knowledge base. I find it a little messy to have one single instance of emacs and juggling all the buffers, which I switch constantly, between buffers of the same project and from the other projects open. Does
[14:40:29] <Fernando-Basso> anyone has some practical advice, or would like to share their personal opinion about this?
[14:41:09] <contrapunctus> Fernando-Basso: I've heard of people running one Emacs per project or something.
[14:42:07] <contrapunctus> Reading the contents of the file into a list and using whatever looping construct one wants is very slow...the number of records is >6k and we'd  be traversing them twice that way (once to read from the file and once to iterate over the resulting list).
[14:42:49] <Fernando-Basso> contrapunctus: Yes, I do sometimes run multiple emacs instances, per project. I'm not sure if it is the best approach for me. Perhaps I'll have to keep trying and making notes of the pros and cons to have a more informed opinion at some point.

[20:48:55] <fsbot> [->] KeyBindings are [0/5] say you want to set `C-c c' to run `recompile'; then put this in your ~/.emacs: (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'recompile)
[20:48:55] <fsbot> [1] in general, it is a good idea to keep your personal bindings to `C-c <letter>' --- i.e., C-c followed by an unmodified letter --- as those keys are reserved for the user (but note that `C-c C-<letter>' keys are reserved for major modes)

[21:38:23] <wgreenhouse> others omit to do this and then you would have to
[21:38:50] <Bayes> wgreenhouse oh okay, thanks. So it's mostly about how the packages are programmed
[21:39:40] <Bayes> on another note, how you track global dotfiles, e.g., /etc/* files? I track my .config and .local files with git
[21:39:43] <wgreenhouse> yes. there is a way to manipulate auto-mode-alist from within use-package, too. but often not necessary because a package implementing a major mode often does this OOTB

[21:41:52] <wgreenhouse> Bayes: you can track /etc/ with git too, either manually or with something like `etckeeper`. others like to use configuration management tools like ansible to declare and then apply a desired state, instead of tracking configuration after the fact

[21:43:02] <rudybot> contrapunctus: In order to evaluate (number? 1) in Edwin, you need to tell Edwin that you want to evaluate it.  You do this by typing `C-x C-e'.
[21:43:23] <Bayes> wgreenhouse uh yeah when I googled solutions for dotfile tracking I found many. I was hoping to do something "simple" that don't require me to have an extra dependency.
[21:43:25] <wgreenhouse> ^ guix for example would let you write one scheme file to define a whole system's packages and configuration 
[21:44:56] <wgreenhouse> 95% of the time just using git on /etc/ will be fine. just be aware there are files like passwd and such in there that have special rules about their permissions, etc. that git itself cannot track or restore 
[21:45:06] <Bayes> dotbot was the option that seemed best from what I read
[21:45:11] <wgreenhouse> that's all that etckeeper adds

[21:45:51] <krux02> wgreenhouse, I just tried it out, using the string arguments for make-sparse-keymap makes it impossible to use define-key on it.

[23:18:34] <dpk> parsnip: MacBooks will charge with both under-watted and over-watted chargers, but using one might fuck the battery up
[23:19:14] <parsnip> yeah i usually buy the exact model intended, but was just curious. i guess 100W is the big no no
[23:19:15] <dpk> and using a severely under-watted one might only give you enough power to avoid running the battery down, rather than actually being able to charge from ti
