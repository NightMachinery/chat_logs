[00:13:07] <BtbN> What distro version is that?
[00:13:38] <kepstin> exherbo linux with glibc 2.34. so kind of an oddball distro
[00:13:39] <BtbN> I'm targetting a really old glibc version, Ubuntu 16.04 like
[00:13:57] <BtbN> So it's supposed to work on glibc >=2.23
[00:15:03] <BtbN> So unless latest glibc broke backwards compat, I have no idea what'd cause that error.

[00:19:42] <BtbN> I deleted all of those.
[00:19:45] <kepstin> which then conflicts with the dynamicly linked system glibc
[00:20:40] <BtbN> It also works fine here on Ubuntu 20.04

[11:39:58] <irc_user> Hi, if I try to convert an HEVC taken with an iPhone 13 to h264, the resulting file's color is super bright. Is there any way to fix that?
[11:41:10] <galad> make sure the color info is not lost in the conversion
[11:41:21] <galad> iPhone records in hlg + dolby vision by default
[11:41:41] <galad> at least you should try to preserve the hlg color info
[11:41:58] <galad> or set it to record in sdr in iOS preferences
[11:43:12] <irc_user> galad: this video file is already in hdr and I'm not really able to re-record it, what exactly would I do to preserve the hlg color info? Is there a flag for that?
[11:43:14] <irc_user> And thank you for responding
[11:44:04] <galad> the latest ffmpeg version should preserve it automatically
[11:45:16] <galad> if not, try something like   -color_primaries 9 -color_trc 18 -colorspace 9

[11:53:07] <irc_user> galad: Hmm, updating to `4.4.1` didn't seem to do the trick, and those flags placed just before the output file didn't seem to have an effect either. I am getting a ton of `Skipping NAL unit 62` warnings, I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it. Any ideas?
[11:53:58] <galad> check the output in ffprobe, does it say bt2020nc/bt2020/arib-std-b67 for the video track?

[12:00:44] <irc_user> Oh hmm, I'm playing the resulting video with `mpv`, maybe that's the issue. Ideally I'd like for the video to work normally in that player too though.
[12:01:43] <galad> are you playing the original file with mpv too?
[12:05:21] <irc_user> If I play the original with mpv, it also has bad colors. But I'm saying I'd like to be able to convert this iphone video to a format that can be played by most video players/video editors with approximately the original colors. If I want to edit either of the files with blender without messing up the colors, I wouldn't know how.

[12:10:53] <galad> you can try zscale and tonemap filter to convert it to bt.709, but I doubt it will be the same as being played on the iphone, I don't know if the upcoming libplacebo supports dolby vision metadata

[12:19:47] <irc_user> Ah I understand more now, thank you. Seems like iMovie might have an SDR switch so I'll try that and if it doesn't work I'll use the tonemap filter. My mind doesn't usually gravitate towards iMovie as the solution to anything lol. Thanks a lot for your help!!
[12:21:22] <galad> well, apple's softwares support all the common dolby vision profiles and have a good tone mapping implementation
[12:30:41] <irc_user> Then I am hopeful imove will work after i finish updating haha

[14:31:34] <deep_blue_assemb> hi, does anyone know how variable frame *size* is accomplished in videos? or even what it's called in documentation? i've seen it in a vp8 .webm and a h264 .mp4
[14:31:35] <deep_blue_assemb> here is a specimen: https://mega.nz/file/g9AjRQZB#MUqmuFJRylkToMDRI12juZK-hjXPqzVwtZVE7cGgG7o

[14:33:23] <AMM> You just encode different resolutions and then concatenate them, say with the concat demuxer and -c copy
[14:34:22] <AMM> I don't know what the standards say about video stream size changes or reinitialization, but that's how it works, the stream has new parameters
[14:34:36] <AMM> it's horrible
[14:36:10] <deep_blue_assemb> how peculiar. thanks a bunch. i wish GUI editors had support for this, it's better than alpha channels for some purposes, and provides alpha channel like behavior for codecs that don't support alpha channel

[15:19:01] <haasn> 09:40 <galad> you can try zscale and tonemap filter to convert it to bt.709, but I doubt it will be the same as being played on the iphone, I don't know if the upcoming libplacebo supports dolby vision metadata
[15:19:03] <haasn> it does
[15:19:21] <haasn> but that only really matters for profile 5
[15:20:22] <JEEB> magical metadata that converts HLG to PQ
[15:20:23] <JEEB> lol
[15:20:34] <JEEB> that's essentially all that 8.4 metadata was, IIRC
[15:20:40] <JEEB> (which is what iphone does)
[15:21:17] <galad> dolby magic™
[15:24:09] <haasn> libplacebo also supports HLG, to
[15:24:11] <haasn> so*
[15:28:14] <JEEB> and many other things
[15:28:20] <JEEB> galad: now it is much less than magic lol
[15:28:30] <JEEB> magic means you don't understand it
[15:28:45] <JEEB> now specifically thanks to haasn et al we do understand it :P
[15:28:57] <JEEB> but yes, it should be usable as-is as HLG
[15:29:13] <JEEB> you could say that having the PQ'ification with the RPUs is """better""" but eh
[15:30:34] <JEEB> in any case with that stuff unless you have to produce an 8bit, SDR file, don't tone map during encoding
[15:30:39] <JEEB> keep it as HLG
[15:35:30] <galad> unfortunately there is a noticeable difference when playing back a hlg + dolby versus only hlg in quicktime
