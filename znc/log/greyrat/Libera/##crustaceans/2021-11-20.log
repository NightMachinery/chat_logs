[00:00:53] <dminkovsky> thanks gerikson. i think they moderated all the crypto posts and pinned it to the top lol
[00:01:01] <dminkovsky> they tweaked the title...
[00:01:19] <dminkovsky> aw not #1 as of just now anymore
[00:01:22] <dminkovsky> that's okay :)
[00:01:33] <dminkovsky> spoke too soon, as they say
[00:13:50] <imode> spotify is on _fire_ for me today.
[00:14:00] <dminkovsky> knows you very well?
[00:14:13] <imode> not entirely but I left it playing at the end of an AAL album and I've loved every track.
[00:14:28] <dminkovsky> spotify is pretty excellent in my experience
[00:14:42] <imode> if only they'd pay their artists more.
[00:14:58] <imode> ..and allow me to export my shit properly.
[00:23:27] <dminkovsky> apparently apple music pays best?
[00:24:39] <bontaq> weirdly I believe peloton does actually (per stream)
[00:31:36] <defect> what about tidal? wasn't their whole thing that it paid artists better?

[00:35:25] <buttsbot> A California city is asking retirees, stay-at-home parents, and students to work 20 hours a week at struggling businesses to help ease a lab...
[00:35:28] <manicennui> ...
[00:37:39] <bontaq> lol "please don't make us raise wages ANYTHING BUT THAT"
[00:38:08] <manicennui> I don't understand this thinking that all of this shitty businesses have to continue to exist
[00:38:12] <manicennui> Go the fuck out of business
[00:42:18] <imode> externalizing the cost of their bad business is a part of running a business.

[00:45:15] <mouseghost> its buggy asf
[00:45:40] <mouseghost> no mans sky was also buggy at launch, but i think they fixed it enough
[00:45:49] <mouseghost> oddly enough all them space games are buggy
[00:45:50] <gwozniak> what in the fuck... (that 20-hour work thing)
[00:46:06] <riv> wow that looks exciting

[01:39:30] <hoistbypetard> imode: i don't see how that counts as externalizing the cost unless the retirees/SAH parents/students will be coerced to work or the city is picking up the tab. if it's not at either of those points, this is just recruiting a broader pool before they bite the bullet and advertise higher pay for the work.

[06:58:01] <manicennui> The fact that Tiger King is number one on Netflix again does not bode well for humanity.
[07:00:11] <dminkovsky> that guy just died
[07:00:18] <dminkovsky> the king of tigers
[07:00:28] <companion_cube> did he die of tigers?
[07:00:57] <manicennui> Pretty sure Joe Exotic is alive unfortunately.
[07:01:09] <manicennui> Not sure what you are referring to.
[07:01:16] <imode> yeah.
[07:01:20] <imode> he's alive.
[07:01:23] <imode> and kicking..
[07:01:48] <manicennui> And probably profiting from being a piece of shit.
[07:03:00] <dminkovsky> never seen the show so i don't know who's who but this guy i saw in the news the other day
[07:03:03] <dminkovsky> https://www.tmz.com/2021/09/07/tiger-king-zookeeper-erik-cowie-dead-dies/
[07:03:04] <buttsbot> 'Tiger King' Zookeeper Erik Cowie Dead at 53
[07:03:04] <companion_cube> what's the show about anyway? a guy who tames tigers?
[07:04:36] <manicennui> Ah, he was one of the zookeepers it seems.
[07:06:38] <manicennui> companion_cube: He ran an animal park. He is now in prison.
[07:07:55] <manicennui> The show is about typical trashy humans doing trashy shit.
[07:08:25] <dminkovsky> you knwo what i would watch again the first few season of is jersey shore
[07:08:31] <dminkovsky> if we're talking trashy
[07:08:52] <manicennui> I rather that reality shows were about great people doing great shit.
[07:09:25] <dminkovsky> like what
[07:15:23] <manicennui> Like the work Stacey Abrams is doing.
[07:16:05] <manicennui> Or do something on the career of Jos√© Andr√©s and his charitable activities.
[07:18:59] <manicennui> It's one thing when they do reality shows with washed up celebs, but Netflix made Joe Exotic famous.
[07:19:46] <bkero> Why fuck around with B tier shows when Cowboy Bebop just dropped
[07:20:10] <manicennui> bkero: Because Americans are trashy.
[07:22:04] <companion_cube> problem is great shit is often non glamorous or boring to watch
[07:23:45] <manicennui> Making shitty people rich and famous is a big part of what is wrong with the US.
[07:25:34] <companion_cube> I'd watch a show with Trump in it
[07:26:01] <companion_cube> if it were one where he has to do an obstable course and ridicule himself
[07:26:04] <companion_cube> :-¬∞
[07:26:07] <companion_cube> obstacle
[07:26:36] <manicennui> Like if we were to give him to the Taliban as their prisoner as long as they film whatever they do to him?
[07:56:26] <companion_cube> idk, they'd just try to ransom him
[07:56:41] <companion_cube> and he would die a american "hero", can you imagine
[07:57:33] <manicennui> His cult would start a gofundme
[07:58:09] <companion_cube> gofindme
[07:58:21] <companion_cube> however we know he doens't like people who get captured.
[08:01:11] <imode> he already hates and loves himself, don't worry.

[09:30:06] <imode> "Arm yourselves" is the thing that people need to hear.

[09:38:51] <manicennui> I don't know. I think they'd like to have an excuse to shoot more people.

[10:18:45] <defect> and in other news, airbnb is more garbage than ever
[10:19:25] <defect> going to toronto, the host told me to avoid the front desk security, never EVER tell anyone the apartment number, and not open the door if anyone knocked
[10:20:02] <defect> but they've "had 200+ guests without a problem"
[10:23:18] <imode> yeeeeeeeeah that's uh.

[10:23:44] <imode> I don't wanna have to play James Bond every time I stay some place.
[10:23:54] <defect> yea same
[10:24:11] <defect> whole reason for my trip is to relax
[10:24:29] <defect> not gonna relax if i have to sneak by security and lie if anyone talks to me
[10:25:36] <defect> they also opened with house rules saying no one not listed in the booking would be allowed
[10:25:49] <defect> which i guess is fine. i'm not going to have a party or whatever
[10:26:09] <imode> all of that screams "I'm not allowed to host people according to my lease".
[10:26:10] <defect> but they followed it up with saying that there's cameras in the elavators and on each floor
[10:26:14] <defect> yep
[10:26:31] <defect> cancelled that shit and went for a regular hoetl
[10:26:34] <defect> hotel*
[10:27:25] <dminkovsky> a lot to be said for a hotel
[10:27:39] <defect> it also wasn't that much more expensive
[10:27:48] <defect> think i'm done with airbnb
[10:27:55] <dminkovsky> airbnbs i think are best for destination stays
[10:28:17] <defect> what's a destination stay?
[10:29:14] <dminkovsky> like nature or boutique urban or a wedding group
[10:30:12] <defect> oh yeah. i mean, if the host actually owns the place it's probably good. but i'm never getting an airbnb in a condo building again
[10:31:35] <manicennui> Condos are owned.
[10:32:17] <defect> i mean sure. but there is still usually a bunch of rules and a management company
[10:32:43] <manicennui> Management company just enforces the rules of the owners.
[10:32:53] <defect> i live in a conda and i'm not allowed to have a pitbull
[10:32:54] <manicennui> Blame owners for violating airbnb/rental rules.
[10:33:01] <defect> i do
[10:33:32] <manicennui> defect: And if you could convince the other owners in your association to change that rule, it would be changed.
[10:33:38] <defect> yes
[10:33:45] <defect> i'm not disagreeing with you
[10:34:16] <manicennui> Depending on where you are staying, condos are really the best option for an airbnb.
[10:34:21] <manicennui> Not going to stay in a house in NYC.
[10:34:21] <defect> i'm complaining that the owner of the place i was going to airbnb wasn't upfront with the rules, and would make me lie to stay there
[10:34:34] <manicennui> You should just report them.
[10:34:37] <defect> i will
[10:35:03] <defect> and last i checked in NYC you can do airbnb short-style rentals for less than 30 days
[10:35:22] <defect> might've changed
[10:35:30] <manicennui> I mean the places you'd want to stay in NYC are not going to be houses.
[10:35:35] <defect> right
[10:35:43] <defect> and you'd want to stay less than 30 days
[10:35:46] <Church> Yeah NYC can be... fun wrt housing
[10:36:15] <defect> i think we're saying the same thing
[10:36:46] <manicennui> The entire hospitality industry is terrible.
[10:37:01] <defect> condo building have their rules, set by the owners (mostly). airbnb hosts ignore that, and try to get their guests to sneak around
[10:37:08] <manicennui> I stay in fairly nice hotels sometimes, and they really aren't that great.
[10:37:35] <defect> i'm not gonna sneak around, because that's not a relaxing time for me
[10:37:47] <manicennui> You're mostly paying for location and reputation.
[10:37:48] <defect> not sure why i tried airbnb and didn't go for a regular ol hotel
[10:38:57] <defect> had a couple of good experiences with airbnb previously, but i'm done with it now
[10:39:46] <manicennui> I can stay at places through airbnb that are just not available otherwise.
[10:40:09] <manicennui> I stayed on a farm near Asheville in a private structure that was next to the animals.
[10:40:14] <manicennui> On ~75 acres.

[10:40:29] <manicennui> It was great.

[10:44:50] <manicennui> Barraza's lawsuit was filed about six weeks after a federal jury awarded $137 million to Owen Diaz, a Black worker who alleged that Tesla failed to take reasonable steps to prevent racist abuse at the Fremont factory.
[10:45:35] <defect> fuck, for $137 million that had to be pretty bad?
[10:46:05] <manicennui> "I don't know if it's the 12-hour shifts that get to these guys or what it is‚Äîthey just act like they've never seen girls in there or something," said Blickman, a production associate.

[10:46:57] <manicennui> Diaz, an elevator operator at the company‚Äôs Fremont factory for nine months from 2015 to 2016, had been called racial epithets by coworkers, was told to ‚Äúgo back to Africa,‚Äù and saw racist graffiti in the bathrooms. The trial lasted a little over a week, and the jury found that Tesla had not taken reasonable steps to prevent racial harassment.
[10:47:31] <defect> uff
[10:48:25] <defect> nobody changed the world on 40 hours a week, but work 12-hour shifts and i guess it's cool to be racist
[10:48:32] <manicennui> Other workers, such as Melvin Berry, have been forced into arbitration. In Berry‚Äôs case, an arbitrator found that Tesla had failed to stop racial discrimination at its Fremont factory, where supervisors had called him racial slurs. Yet partly because Berry‚Äôs case went to arbitration, the judgment was far less‚Äîjust $1 million.

[21:32:51] * manicennui feels his body relaxing
[21:33:00] <manicennui> I don't understand why I feel so much stress about work.
[21:33:03] <manicennui> My job isn't hard.
[21:33:55] <skyl4rk> maybe the environment in which the work is performed?
[21:34:21] <manicennui> Sitting on my couch.
[21:34:25] <manicennui> My coworkers are all nice,.
[21:34:47] <manicennui> There are things that I don't like about the job, but they don't seem like they should be this stressful.
[21:38:02] <imode> do you enjoy the work?
[21:38:41] <manicennui> Not especially.
[21:38:52] <imode> there's yer peroblem.
[21:38:59] <manicennui> Enjoying one's work is a luxury IMHO.
[21:39:09] <manicennui> I doubt many people do.
[21:39:18] <manicennui> At best it is tolerable.
[21:39:18] <skyl4rk> does it run along or counter to your thoughts on what society needs in order to improve?
[21:39:33] <manicennui> skyl4rk: Most things do.
[21:39:36] <manicennui> So yes.
[21:42:08] <manicennui> Like what companies are using technology to do things that are truly beneficial to society?
[21:42:19] <imode> internet archive.
[21:44:43] <manicennui> An archive of all of the stupid bullshit that is arguably making society worse?
[21:45:22] <imode> if that's all you think they store, you should probably give it a look.
[21:45:59] <skyl4rk> well, at a certain way of drawing lines there is nothing anyone can do ever that is not evil
[21:46:02] <manicennui> Is there anything else on the Internet?
[21:46:25] <skyl4rk> if you eat an apple you hinder the apple's ability to become a tree
[21:46:27] <imode> they're a general preserver of any kind of medium.
[21:46:33] <imode> not just "stuff on the internet".
[21:46:50] <manicennui> skyl4rk: Not if I throw the seeds into the woods.
[21:47:15] <imode> archivists are a universal good.
[21:47:27] <manicennui> Pretty sure the seeds are able to survive the digestive tracts of animals that eat them.
[21:48:00] <skyl4rk> but do you throw them in the woods? do you go to the woods by car? etc and so on, the apple or the seeds are not the point here.
[21:48:05] <skyl4rk> nor is the car.
[21:48:23] <imode> yeah, by defeatist logic, everything is evil because we have an impact.
[21:48:23] <manicennui> skyl4rk: Apples wouldn't even exist in the US without humans. We drastically increase their numbers.
[21:48:29] <manicennui> I'm not worried about harming apples.
[21:48:41] <skyl4rk> still. the apples are not the point.
[21:49:03] <imode> "doing something", even so much as existing, requires you harm something else.
[21:49:09] <imode> or affect something else.
[21:49:15] <manicennui> If you are trying to convince me that humanity is evil you need not put any more effort into it.
[21:49:36] <imode> I mean it's not just humanity, it's literally everything that lives.
[21:50:14] <manicennui> Most beings are held in check by other beings and the systems they live within.
[21:50:17] <manicennui> But not humans.
[21:50:49] <imode> and invasive species.
[21:50:50] <manicennui> The only thing that has a chance against us is pathogens.
[21:51:15] <manicennui> imode: Many of which were introduced by humans.
[21:51:22] <imode> ehhhhhhh not really, no.
[21:51:38] <imode> we didn't create them, or even move them. they just "exist". the problem is scale.
[21:51:45] <imode> an invasive species can cover an area. we cover the world.
[21:51:52] <manicennui> We moved many, many invasive species.
[21:52:09] <imode> and prior to our "meddling", they were just fine being invasive where they were as much as where they were moved to.
[21:52:36] <manicennui> I don't think they are considered invasive where they are from, except to humans.
[21:52:46] <skyl4rk> I'm not trying to convince you that humans are evil through apple eating. I was trying to make an example by analogy that pretty much any act could be judged as evil, but we got lost in discussing the details of the example, and loopholes for it.
[21:52:55] <imode> something that has the ability to overwhelm a portion of the environment didn't "choose to do so" because of us picking it up and moving it somewhere.
[21:53:19] <imode> skyl4rk: that seems par for the course. :\
[21:53:27] <manicennui> imode: The difference is that it probably evolved alongside the other creatures where it is from.
[21:53:35] <manicennui> So many have adapted to it.
[21:53:44] <manicennui> When we move it, it often just wipes things out.
[21:54:31] <imode> "I moved this fire from point A to point B, and when it moved to point B, everything caught fire! must've been because I moved it", ignoring the roaring fire that you took it from.

[21:55:54] <imode> so is this.
[21:56:59] <imode> brb.
[21:58:03] <manicennui> I think the least bad company I worked for as a software developer was the company that did software duplication, packaging, and fulfillment.
[21:58:10] <manicennui> Unless we consider all software to be evil.
[21:59:17] <manicennui> The last company sold a medical information system, which seems positive until you see the reality that all of the medical information systems contribute to the financial problems in healthcare by extracting profits from it while delivering garbage software.
[21:59:28] <manicennui> And a lot of it is aimed at increasing billing.
[21:59:41] <manicennui> And now I work on lending.
[22:00:07] <manicennui> Maybe I can do something even more evil next.
