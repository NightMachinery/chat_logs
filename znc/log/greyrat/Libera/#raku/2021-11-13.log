[14:42:45] <patrickb> o/
[14:44:24] <patrickb> I have a project that reproducibly uses a stale precomp file and doesn't recompile the changed source.
[14:45:09] <patrickb> Since it's so nicely reproducible, I'd say it's a good place to debug the behavior.
[14:45:28] <patrickb> Anyone around to give me some hints of where to look?
[14:53:15] <lizmat> fwiw, I see this behaviour when I'm reinstalling a module from source with --force, while running tests on a dependency with -Ilib
[14:53:37] <lizmat> I would have to nuke the lib/.precomp in the dependency to "see" the newly installed module
[14:53:53] <lizmat> patrickb: does that match any of your situation ?
[14:59:40] <patrickb> In this case it's the script I'm calling itself
[15:00:28] <patrickb> so not a module. I'm pretty sure I did change the -I parameters before it started doing this.
[15:01:16] <patrickb> Sadly adding RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG causes a ton of output but then segfaults.
[15:01:43] <lizmat> segfaults?   interesting...  I've never seen that
[15:01:57] <patrickb> I'm on 2021.09
[15:02:23] <lizmat> I'm sure we could need some precomp sanity checker logic...  nine ugexe might know if that already exists
[15:02:27] <patrickb> <hanging the version will probably spoil the reproducibility though.

[16:39:33] <ugexe> i usually forget most of what i know about precomp days after i do anything with it, so when i debug its generally just placing print statements in the various CU::* classes but that would kill your reproducibility
[16:41:43] <ugexe> you might also try to whittle down your script / dependencies to the bare `use` statements required to reproduce (to potentially reduce RMD output)
[16:47:13] <patrickb> thanks. This is helpful.
[16:47:39] <patrickb> Let's see when this comes up again.
[16:49:40] <ugexe> adding a new path to the includes via e.g. -I parameters will change which precomp gets used as well

[16:50:00] <ugexe> raku -Ixxx -I. bin/zef --help
[16:50:11] <ugexe> one will precomp into ./, one into ./xxx

[17:07:18] <ugexe> CUR.install(..., :force) will leave the old precomp files behind. perhaps it should remove those, but then thats really just making :force an alias for uninstall + install (i.e. maybe use uninstall before installing instead of force)

[18:34:26] <patrickb> When seeing "const_iX NYI" that's definitely a compiler bug, because that OP shouldn't show up in compilation, correct?
[18:34:59] * patrickb sees those on latest master.
[18:54:00] <tonyo> patrickb: does the module have a `use lib` init?
[18:59:09] <Xliff> I am currently working on a program that needs to pull a type off of an attribute. However, when I do so I am getting a "MyType(Any)" rather than a "MyType" 
[18:59:17] <Xliff> How can I get rid of the "(Any)"

[22:53:16] <A26F64> I'm wondering if someone could recommend a straightforward tutorial explaining how to distribute several modules, classes, subsets, etc. in separate files and then execute them locally as a module.  Basically, how to create a working module that may or may not end up deployed into the broader Raku module ecosystem.  I feel that the official
[22:53:17] <A26F64> documentation, while overall excellent, is not particularly clear on that.
[22:53:21] <A26F64> (Definitely a beginner's question.  I did ask in #raku-beginner once earlier without seeing a response.)
[22:53:30] <A26F64> In Perl packages are placed in files, identified with the `package` keyword with double-colon separators, and then imported by `use`ing that full identifier.  Raku is (I am to understand) not that simple.
[22:54:58] <A26F64> There's quite a bit of discussion in the documentation about actually using the elements of a module once installed via zef.  But there's little about setting this up locally yourself.  The "modules" page contains paragraphs about META6.json and something called "compunits" and the -I switch and who knows what else.  All of which (at first, anyway)
[22:54:59] <A26F64> seems relatively complicated for just creating a set of interrelated files.
[22:56:46] <ugexe> so dont overcomplicate it
[22:57:03] <ugexe> it sounds like most of what you are asking would be the same as in perl
[22:57:24] <gfldex> A26F64: we tend to use tools like https://raku.land/cpan:SKAJI/App::Mi6 and https://raku.land/github:gfldex/META6::bin
[22:58:38] <A26F64> I did find those listed at https://docs.raku.org/language/modules-extra.  But those represent very simple repositories.
[23:00:28] <A26F64> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/cc8792281f469efd5cdf05e3b00e953b/pasted.txt
[23:00:49] <A26F64> I didn't mean to send that as a file.
[23:00:53] <A26F64> I eventually found out that you need to use the -I switch to use CompUnit::Repository::FileSystem instead of CompUnit::Repository::Installation.  In fact the CompUnit::Repository::FileSystem method of doing things seems to be incompatible with the Installation method that is the preferred ultimate form of the module since the former uses Perlian
[23:00:53] <A26F64> filesystem references and the latter META6.json.
[23:01:44] <A26F64> For example, do you have to temporarily specify directories in your `use` statements during development and then convert all such statements to call whatever is defined in META6.json's `provides` attribute once you are ready to release the thing to the module ecosystem?  (Assuming, of course, that you even intend to do so?)
[23:01:49] <ugexe> there is a lot wrong with that statement. first -I isn't tied to a specific compunit repo, it could very well point to a installation. secondly i'm not what you mean by its not compatible... it very much is compatible
[23:02:15] <ugexe> and indeed a ::FileSystem will use a META6.json assuming one exists at whatever directory you point at
[23:02:49] <ugexe> A26F64: i would suggest trying whatever you think would work in perl
[23:06:57] <A26F64> Please correct me if I'm wrong about this observation: I discovered that specifying a filesystem file in META6.json's `provides` attribute seems to load the whole file without respect to the module name used as the corresponding key.  Which means that a file `use`ing one class in that file suddenly has access to all classes in it.  I thought that
[23:06:57] <A26F64> META6.json was intended to limit access to packages in the namespace.
[23:08:04] <ugexe> a whole file always gets loaded regardless of what is loading it
[23:09:20] <ugexe> so if youre asking if you can have `package Foo { class Foo1 { } }; package Bar { class Bar1 { } };` in a single file yet load/expose only one of Foo or Bar, then no that doesnt work
[23:09:48] <ugexe> regardless if its ::FileSystem or ::Installation
[23:13:54] <A26F64> I had kind of assumed that META6.json restricted the packages themselves mainly because https://docs.raku.org/language/modules says: "In the provides section, include all the namespaces provided by your distribution and that you wish to be installed".  That doesn't exactly say that other namespaces won't be installed, I guess, but it wasn't a leap
[23:13:54] <A26F64> to infer that.
[23:14:44] <ugexe> yeah thats not exactly an accurate statement 
[23:16:24] <ugexe> all the files and namespaces get installed. the namespace part of the provides just provides the namespace to load with, and may not neccesarily match any namespaces in the file
[23:17:46] <ugexe> i mean ideally sure it'd be great if it could do what you suggest though (and I think the original design docs suggest this) 
[23:18:51] <ugexe> but if you list `"A1":"lib/Foo.rakumod", "A2":"lib/Foo.rakumod"` then you just precompile Foo.rakumod twice and make it `use`able via `use A1` or `use A2`
[23:20:21] <A26F64> I suppose that we can be somewhat minimalist, then, in what we supply to `provides`.
[23:20:33] <A26F64> Allow me also to (try to) explain my earlier comment that the compunit modes are inconsistent....
[23:21:17] <ugexe> for provides you generally want one entry for each file, and given each file some namespace you will `use` (which generally matches whatever the top level namespace declared in the file is, but might not be)
[23:24:09] <A26F64> (I thought that I had an expressive example for my comment but need to review that.  Sorry.)
[23:25:04] <A26F64> I can experiment with the file namespaces given your explanation above; thank you.
