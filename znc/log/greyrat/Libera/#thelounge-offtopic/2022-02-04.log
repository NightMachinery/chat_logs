[20:16:35] <xnaas> Humans are habitual. M
[20:16:53] <xnaas> They'll just keep doing the same thing forever if it's working. :P
[20:17:04] <xnaas> (Hell, even what it's not working!)
[20:18:07] <bookworm> who needs dependency resolution anyhow right?
[20:18:13] <bookworm> just yolo it
[20:18:39] <bookworm> and hey, flagship feature, they got PAM! how awesome! /s
[20:19:26] <bookworm> I mean, if they like to tinker go nuts, but that's not remotely a thing you can actually use
[20:19:33] <bookworm> about the same as linux from scratch
[20:22:33] <Activ8> if it's working why change for the sake of change
[20:22:40] <Activ8> that's what breaks things right? lol
[20:22:57] <bookworm> working is in the eye of the beholder
[20:23:39] <Activ8> You get an absolute shit show usually if people keep trying to change working things
[20:24:00] <Activ8> without correct testing procedures anyway lol
