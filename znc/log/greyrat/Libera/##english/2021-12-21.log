[00:30:01] <GuiToris> t'was quick
[00:30:30] <blkshp> lol, that answered the last question you asked me, seems like weeks ago
[00:30:41] <GuiToris> I must have been that nice too
[00:30:56] <GuiToris> soo, I got lost in reported speech
[00:31:18] <GuiToris> how about this: You asked me who my favorite artist was
[00:31:23] <GuiToris> is that good?!
[00:32:16] <GuiToris> or You asked me who was my favorite artist
[00:32:57] <blkshp> Depends but it doesn't really matter
[00:34:15] <GuiToris> this grammar section is dying, and it's really confusing that everyone uses it differently. I'm hoping that British stick to one
[00:34:29] <blkshp> Hahaahhhahaahahaahhaaa
[00:34:30] <blkshp> hahaahah
[00:34:32] <blkshp> ha
[00:34:38] * blkshp breathes
[00:35:25] <blkshp> I'd say 1) was more popular.
[00:36:10] <GuiToris> ^ you see, when I asked my American friends, they tended to correct me there
[00:36:23] <GuiToris> and this is not what I was taught
[00:38:22] <blkshp> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:39:38] <GuiToris> oh and another thing,  I'm not sure if you'd been such a big fan of the Mortal Kombat games, but we do the characters say 'I win' or Liu Kang *winS*
[00:39:48] <GuiToris> why are these in present simple?
[00:39:56] <GuiToris> they beat me, they won
[00:39:58] <GuiToris> I don't get this
[00:40:16] <GuiToris> and I played table tennis to an American girl, she beat me, and she said, 'I win'
[00:40:20] <GuiToris> I don't understand this
[00:40:20] <blkshp> "but we do"?
[00:40:34] <GuiToris> no
[00:40:40] <blkshp> "I win" Is a completely normal phrase
[00:40:42] <GuiToris> someone must have hacked my computer
[00:40:51] <GuiToris> but why do the characters
[00:41:12] <blkshp> Because it's a completely normal phrase
[00:41:40] <GuiToris> I win, is present simple, you regularly win, habitual thing
[00:41:55] <GuiToris> or let's try it from the other side, when do you say; I won?
[00:42:22] <blkshp> Interchangably with "I win" except then saying it after the event.
[00:42:35] <tinwhiskers> "I win" just means "I'm the winner of this game", not a longer-term thing
[00:42:39] <mdogg> In the game Mortal Kombat", the there is an announcer who announces who wins.  That's why the announcer says the person's name.
[00:43:12] <GuiToris> mdogg, Shao Khan (spelling may be different) says; I win (he is the announcer, I guess)
[00:43:32] <mdogg> In Mortal Combat?
[00:43:42] <GuiToris> MK3
[00:43:58] <GuiToris> I didn't play the modern ones, I don't play computer games nowadays
[00:44:04] <mdogg> Is the voice the same as the person who says, "Liu Kang wins"?
[00:44:32] <GuiToris> blkshp, is about my age, so I hoped he would know what the heck I am talking about :D
[00:44:42] <mdogg> Maybe in some matches the winner says, "I win".  I haven't played that game for at least 10 years.
[00:45:14] <blkshp> "I am the WINner
[00:45:45] <GuiToris> if I beat someone in a competition, any competition, should I say, I win - you lose, or should I use proper past tense?
[00:46:41] <blkshp> Well saying that should only really be used in a jovial sense. "I win, you lose /me pokes out tongue"
[00:46:43] <mdogg> Well, if you beat somebody in a competition, they already know who the winner was.  So it's best not to say anything, in my opinion.
[00:47:50] <mdogg> Or as blkshp stated..
[00:48:20] <GuiToris> it just took me a second to look that word up
[00:48:22] <GuiToris> thank you
[00:48:37] <GuiToris> my nephew tells me 'I win' all the time, and I wasn't sure if I should correct him or not
[00:48:49] <GuiToris> but I guess I should let him say
[00:48:53] <GuiToris> thanks a lot
[00:48:55] <GuiToris> you win
[00:50:19] <GuiToris> uhh, I missed this line [22:14] <mdogg> Is the voice the same as the person who says, "Liu Kang wins"?
[00:50:22] <GuiToris> I think yes
[00:50:26] <GuiToris> I'll look this up
[00:51:14] <GuiToris> I use a printed dictionary and I sometimes miss some lines
[00:51:47] <GuiToris> https://youtu.be/PTXqXqhbxOI?t=120
[00:52:09] <mdogg> Well, what I mean is, there is an announcer who says, "Finish him!".  What would be the same voice who says, "Liu Kang wins.".
[00:52:34] <mdogg> In that example, that is the announcer.
[00:52:36] <GuiToris> https://youtu.be/ikWeup2QW6I?t=90
[00:53:06] <mdogg> Those are the announcer.
[00:53:26] <GuiToris> I think Shao Khan is supposed to say all of these
[00:53:53] <mdogg> I don't know who that is.  
[00:54:11] <GuiToris> the guy in my previous link
[00:54:14] <mdogg> But certainly the person you're fighting wouldn't say "finish him".
[00:54:47] <mdogg> No, the announcer says, "Show Khan wins, flawless victory"
[00:55:02] <GuiToris> what?! lemme check that again
[00:55:23] <GuiToris> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTXqXqhbxOI&t=120s
[00:55:30] <GuiToris> I win, flawless victory
[00:56:11] <GuiToris> that made me think that Shao Kahn is the announcer
[00:57:29] <GuiToris> I never knew the story of the game because at that time I didn't understand English, and I tried reading it a couple of years ago, and my computer was so much faster that I couldn't read it though, it showed the text a couple of seconds, say 5 secs
[00:57:35] <mdogg> Oh yeah.  That sounds right then.
[00:58:16] <GuiToris> thank you for helping :)
[00:59:01] <mdogg> No problem - it's hard to hear the "I win" at first but it does sound like he says that, which does make him the announcer.
[00:59:53] <GuiToris> very surprising :O
[01:00:23] <GuiToris> it must be easier to me, I played this game a lot in elementary school, this was my favorite game
[01:01:18] <mdogg> Yeah, I haven't played the game since I was a kid either.  I never got that far.
[01:02:06] <mdogg> My favorite Nintendo game was Legend of Zelda.
[01:03:02] <GuiToris> I heard of it but I never looked it up, maybe it's time to do it now
[01:03:20] <mdogg> Oh, it's not a big deal.
[01:07:00] <GuiToris> mdogg, was Nintendo connected to the TV set?
[01:07:13] <GuiToris> or was it a handheld device?
[01:07:41] <mdogg> Well, there was a GameBoy which was Nintendo's handheld device.  But a regular Nintendo was connected to the TV.
[01:08:20] <mdogg> I never had a GameBoy.

[01:55:14] <GuiToris> it's like I was watching a landing from the cockpit the other day, and the machine counted the altitude, and it was something like 30 .. 20 .. 10 .. RETARD, RETARD
[01:55:23] <GuiToris> I looked that up: spoken not polite an offensive word for a stupid person
[01:55:26] <GuiToris> ?!
[01:55:38] <GuiToris> I didn't see a comedy
[01:56:31] <TimMc> I the stress is on the second syllable, it's an imperative verb.
[01:56:34] <TimMc> *If
[01:56:45] <TimMc> To retard something is to slow or delay it.
[01:57:19] <GuiToris> there's little chance to find the same video :/
[01:57:27] <GuiToris> I don't understand delay there either
[01:57:42] <GuiToris> 'slow' makes some sense to me
[01:57:58] <TimMc> Probably something about slowing the descent -- not descending as fast?
[01:58:28] <GuiToris> oh, I was thinking of another direction
[01:58:32] <GuiToris> sure it's 3D
[01:59:28] <energizer> maybe they say reTARD because it's unambiguously an imperative, unlike "slow"
[01:59:53] <TimMc> A "retarded person" means "having mental retardation", and that gave rise to the schoolyard taunt "retard" (stress on first syllable.)
[02:00:05] <GuiToris> I thought the plane didn't insult the pilot, it was just weird
[02:00:59] <TimMc> Yeah, just giving the connection.
[02:01:06] <GuiToris> https://youtu.be/ENe89j89tBA?t=529

[02:14:37] <LjL> i think you may be hearing it on the first because the pitch is higher in the first, but i think that's just because of the type of one-word announcement it's giving

[11:31:14] <furrykef> LuisM18: You missed this line:
[11:31:16] <furrykef> <kurahaupo> both fight, but soldier is a job, whereas warrior is a social rank
[11:33:20] <furrykef> Anyway. Another difference is the term "warrior" is often associated with tribes, whereas "soldier" is more often associated with civilizations
[11:34:35] <furrykef> "Gaulish warrior" sounds fine. "Roman warrior" sounds a bit off to me. "Canadian warrior" sounds very silly.
[11:37:37] <furrykef> Though "Aztec warrior" and "Mayan warrior" sound fine to me even though they definitely had civilizations. Maybe because of old-fashioned, imperialistic notions of what constitutes a *real* civilization.
[11:38:30] <furrykef> (I'm not saying they weren't real civilizations, but rather that the Europeans who came over probably didn't see them that way)
[11:39:01] <furrykef> Hmm... "samurai warrior" sounds OK, too.

[15:37:45] <Me-me> That's a complicated question that depends on your resources.
[15:37:57] <pussipupu> I learnt by being born in an English speaking country, that's probably not an option for you though
[15:38:31] <pussipupu> I'm learning Finnish by living and working in Finland, immersion is probably ideal but difficult
[15:38:36] <ffguest_> Me-me: I have no money for this.
[15:38:44] <grys2> ffguest_ I learned through reading and writing practice. I had no access to speaking or listening. so I read and wrote a lot.
[15:39:07] <pussipupu> Some combination of formal study and consuming as much media as you can(and chatting here and along questions)
[15:39:14] <Me-me> Not just money. Time and effort and so on. Immersion, as pussipupu mentions, doesn't necessarily take a lot of money, for example,
[15:39:27] <grys2> so there is a chatbot to facilitate that. it is in #botters-test and it responds to "start news101".
[15:39:49] <pussipupu> There's a lot of interesting podcasts out there these days for instance, listening to those can help
[15:40:29] <grys2> podcasts may be useful to you. I had a audio unfriendly environment so I did not use them.

[15:50:05] <Me-me> The thing I find fun about translation software is you'll rarely stump it on vocabulary - that's a simple lookup. But what keeps getting better is its grasp on syntax. So if you imply something, or use poetic sentence structure, or verb a noun, it doesn't know what to make of it and you have a problem. It can be hard sometimes to watch out for your own linguistic tricks, once they become habitual.

[21:17:48] <Bayes> should I add a dash when using the wise postfix?
[21:18:15] <bin_shoppin> example?
[21:18:51] <Bayes> "Consider the dimension-wise mean", i.e., "Take the mean for each dimension"
[21:19:11] <bin_shoppin> I wouldn't use it that way at all
[21:19:30] <bin_shoppin> "Consider the dimensional mean"
[21:19:50] <Bayes> Strunk & White: "Not to be used indiscriminately as a pseudosuffix" and "There is not a noun in the language to which -wise cannot be added if the spirit moves one to add it."
[21:20:10] <Bayes> bin_shoppin another example, pairwise
[21:20:15] <Bayes> instead of "for each pair"
[21:21:05] <bin_shoppin> not the same thing

[21:24:12] <bin_shoppin> Bayes: "dimension-wise" adds nothing of value compared to "dimensional" and it has the added issue of sounding weird and disjointed.
[21:24:22] <Bayes> :(
[21:24:39] <Bayes> does dimensional really imply that you take the mean over each dimension?
[21:24:47] <bin_shoppin> yes
[21:24:52] <Bayes> and you end up with as many means as each dimension you have?
[21:24:56] <Bayes> okay
[21:25:12] <bin_shoppin> wait what
[21:25:19] <bin_shoppin> as many means as each dimension?
[21:25:23] <Bayes> yep
[21:25:36] <Bayes> say you have a 3D coordinate (x, y, z)
[21:25:47] <bin_shoppin> ok
[21:25:51] <Bayes> a "dimension-wise mean" would be the mean over x, the mean over y, the mean over z
[21:25:56] <Bayes> and so you end up with 3 means
[21:26:17] <bin_shoppin> i don't think that's what dimension-wise means
[21:26:40] <bin_shoppin> why not just say "Consider the mean of each dimension" to make it clear
[21:27:04] <Bayes> yeah I get that
[21:27:16] <Bayes> I was trying to come up with something more succinct, less wordy
[21:27:31] <Bayes> also I just found this, it seems they're using dimension-wise (with a dash) in the same sense
[21:27:32] <Bayes> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0307904X18301033
[21:27:53] <bin_shoppin> sometimes in the attempt to become less verbose, we end up losing the meaning of our intention, and that's never worthwhile
[21:27:57] <Bayes> "a dimension-wise method" [...] "dimension by dimension"
[21:28:04] <bin_shoppin> better to be slightly more wordy and clear than to be succinct and ambiguous
[21:28:15] <Bayes> not true, if you define your term!
[21:28:40] <Bayes> anyway my original question was about having or not a dash
[21:28:44] <Bayes> dimensionwise vs dimension-wise
[21:28:56] <Bayes> eg in pairwise there's no dash
[21:29:08] <Bayes> and not here either https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dimensionwise
[21:29:13] <bin_shoppin> I just don't think that "consider the dimensionwise mean" is necessarily going to communicate that you want 3 separate means
[21:29:56] <Bayes> going by this, the common idea is that wise as with most suffixes don't need a dash https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_words_suffixed_with_-wise
[21:30:04] <bin_shoppin> it sounds like you want the mean of the dimensions combined, not separate.
[21:30:12] <Bayes> no!
[21:30:17] <bin_shoppin> now if it's some kind of jargon, then all bets are off.
[21:30:22] <Bayes> like pairwise, you want as mean means as number of pairs
[21:30:30] <bin_shoppin> Pairwise just means relating to pairs
[21:30:32] <Bayes> as *many means
[21:31:02] <bin_shoppin> "They were separated pairwise"
[21:33:57] <bin_shoppin> idk if you think people will understand "consider the dimension-wise mean" to mean that they will be expected to provide 3 different means, go for it. it might be jargon
