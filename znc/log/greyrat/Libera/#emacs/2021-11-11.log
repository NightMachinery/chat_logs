[02:43:12] <laurus> I am having an issue with org mode publishing. It seems like the attribute :sitemap-sort-files for a project in the variable org-publish-project-alist doesn't sort alphabetically by file names, it sorts alphabetically by #+TITLE attribute in the file. This seems different from what the documentation says... and in any case I can't seem to find the code that determines this. How can I locate that code to confirm the functionality?

[03:13:01] <laurus> Catie: So, my issue is that the org mode documentation doesn't precisely describe what's going on. They say that the 'alphabetically option for sorting files in a sitemap "sorts the files alphabetically", but what the code is actually doing is sorting them based on the #+TITLE attribute. I want to propose an addition that actually sorts by file name alphabetically. Does that sound reasonable?
[03:13:08] <gotwf> void's xbps is a nice pkg mgmnt system.
[03:14:00] <Catie> laurus: That sounds super reasonable to me! I, however, am not the arbiter of what constitutes "reasonable" for the FSF, so I'm afraid I can't really help you there

[03:14:21] <laurus> Catie: Another issue is, I'm not sure if I can write the code properly myself, I never really finished learning Emacs Lisp

[03:15:39] <laurus> What's the proper etiquette here?
[03:15:52] <Catie> Take this with a grain of salt, but in my experience developers generally want to be nice when you submit code to them. I would think that not only would getting a working example running before you send it to them would make them better disposed toward the idea (though again, I can't make any guarantees on the matter), but that the entire experience would be very educational across the board

[03:17:37] <laurus> In case you're interested, I'm writing a small publishing system using org mode, and having to make the titles alphabetical for a chapter list is obviously a massive restriction (chapter titles in a book are generally not alphabetical).
[03:17:42] *** Joins: Jing (~hedgehog@2604:a840:3::1033)
[03:18:07] <Catie> Your file names are alphabetical? Are they like numbered in order?
[03:18:15] <laurus> I set up the thing following what I thought the documentation indicated, i.e. I put "chapter01.org", "chapter02.org", etc.
[03:18:16] <laurus> Yes.
[03:18:42] <laurus> So I expected the sitemap generated to be in that order, but it instead put them in the order of the #+TITLE attributes, which doesn't fit this use case.
[03:18:58] <Catie> Perhaps you could write it in terms of a higher-order function that takes a sort predicate, and publishes based on that order. That would be a very general way of doing it, and makes it extensible

[05:47:05] <wgreenhouse> johnjay: customizable haskell programs (xmonad) typically need to be recompiled/restarted after each customization

[08:04:22] <Jing> Hi, I am trying to experiment with org-mode. I have defined a key binding called "my-org-mode-keybindings" and whenever I typed "C-c c t", Emacs told me "capture abort symbol function definition is void: my-org-mode-keyindings", which was a typo that I already corrected. I have `eval-buffer`ed .emacs, why does it still display this?
[08:07:19] <s-liao> Check the ./emacs file.
[08:08:49] <Jing> Do you mean ~/.emacs? That's what I changed

[09:33:37] <laurus> If in a function I run "insert", then "insert-file-contents", then "insert", the content from "insert-file-contents" comes _after_ the stuff from the second "insert". What causes this?
[09:35:25] <ysftaha> Hello, so I'm trying to write in rtl Arabic the arabic is rendered correctly, but the ui for the arabic paragraph stays ltr.

[09:44:53] <bpalmer> ysftaha: so you want the line numbers that are on the left margin to instead be on the right margin, when the paragraph is RTL?

[16:20:45] <Viking667> 'llo all. I've got some strange problem with my .emacs.desktop file. If I look inside, I can see all the buffers I previously had open. Yet when I do a C-x C-b, I only see *scratch*

[16:21:54] <Viking667> If I try M-x desktop-revert, it tells me desktop is already loaded.
[16:23:21] <Viking667> so I have two questions. (1) how do I get my buffers back? I had a lot of them. and (2) is this .emacs.desktop file hosed, and should I just open up all the buffers manually again?

[22:17:27] <wgreenhouse> e3d3: so, this may be a regression. stated as specifically as you stated it (that there is a conflict between org-tempo and electric-pair-mode when <> is included in the list of pairs) it would be a bug report that I think org maintainers would be likely to look at

[22:20:43] <wgreenhouse> e3d3: there is no need for you to leave. also, if you really want to keep old org, you should be able to do that by grabbing a git repo and checking out some old release tag, and ensuring that that comes above built-in org in load-path.
