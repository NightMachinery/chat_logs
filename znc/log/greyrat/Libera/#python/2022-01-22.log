[03:09:38] <sveinse> Is is considered an antipattern in py to catch one exception and changing it into another? E.g. if you have a parser that expects int in a field from the user, rewriting the ValueError exception into a custom ParseError to expose an external exception type API? I've had bad experiences with blackbox packages that raises exceptions using odd datatypes that is really deep and thus creates tedious except
[03:09:44] <sveinse> statements. I'd rather prefer, say a parser, to raise a singular well-known exception than 3-4 different types.

It's regarding UTF-8 / .txt Fulltext -> SQL attempt w/ formatting problems once in the database or prior (in CSV/LibreCalc). I am getting something wrong here. Not too much activity on python-forum.io (where I posted it) and updated it with my current progress.

Here is manual entry into MariaDB (using Wine + HeidiSQL GUI) and as you can see: same text, not going into Libre Calc first and directly in; completely different (spaces are different): https://i.ibb.co/2ZKswgZ/UMD-WA-1889-DE-SQL-1-2022-01-21-10-07-08.png

[06:00:28] <Cheaterman> (the idea being, i push a package that does contain "." in its name in inittab, but can't import it because python looks for the package and is like "hey, that's a c extension module, not a package")

[06:58:11] <InPhase> KnowledgeShark: There are all sorts of processing errors that can add spaces in between lines though.  A classic case in Python is reading in lines, and then printing them, after which you suddenly get spaces between lines.  e.g.:  https://bpa.st/K4IA
[06:58:41] <InPhase> This happens because each line you read has a newline at the end, and each print adds a newline.

[12:09:40] <bpalmer> See https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/intro_to_graphs ; tf.function converts standard python code to a tf.Function object inside tensorflow's graph. With run_functions_eagerly true, calling a function tries to execute it right away.
[12:09:56] <bpalmer> But see, in particular, this bit: "Tracing captures the TensorFlow operations into a graph, and print is not captured in the graph. That graph is then executed for all three calls without ever running the Python code again."

[14:38:31] <bjs> SGautam: I don't know, you haven't said what the problem is yet.  But I'm just taking an educated guess :)
[14:38:36] <SGautam> because my program outputs the matrix where all the rows are replaced by the last row
[14:38:45] <SGautam> but it correctly calculates the answer for each row
[14:39:05] <deniska> SGautam: [[]] * n creates a list with `n` references to the same list
[14:39:14] <bjs> SGautam: yes, your C is n references to the same row not n different rows
[14:39:17] <bjs> because of the `* n`
[14:39:46] <SGautam> hmm
[14:40:01] <SGautam> why does example_list = [0] * n work then?
[14:40:15] <bjs> SGautam: that gets you n references to 0
[14:40:16] <SGautam> like, shouldn't changing one element change all the others?
[14:40:17] <bjs> which is uh, fine.
[14:40:18] <SGautam> oh

[16:40:33] <ba> There's plenty of room for improvement... I reckon if virtualenv was 10% more user friendly, the desire for pipenv / poetry / pyenv / blahenv tools would drop off a cliff. Maybe I should try writing that multi-shell activation thing
[16:40:52] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[16:41:01] <ba> well, perhaps not pyenv :]
[16:41:36] <nedbat> ba: to make ". venv/activate" work from sh + bat + ps1,  you'd need to get bat and ps1 to understand the "." command, which they don't.  How can virtualenv solve that?
[16:42:23] <nedbat> ba: you're essentially saying, "I want to use different shells, but have them understand the same commands"

[16:48:09] <ba> Yeah, that's one route. But it sucks if your `.gitlab-ci.yml` calls straight into Python - any further commands aren't nicely represented in the CI. And you hit the same problem on most other CI systems where you're expected to define a series of shell steps.
[16:48:53] <ba> On GitLab you can emit some ANSI gubbins to create collapsible command sections, but it's still a bit wonky - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/index.html#custom-collapsible-sections

[17:54:28] <nedbat> relipse: one thing you might like better about PHP: it's integrated directly into your web server, so you can just put PHP code into your html files. Python doesn't do that.
[17:54:55] <ba> Did you know? The reason function names in PHP have such wildly different naming conventions (think nl2br() vs htmlspecialchars()) is that, in the original runtime, the function lookup hash table used len(functionName) as its hash key. So it made PHP faster to choose function names with different lengths.

[18:18:06] <galactoButterfly> appreciate your help btw
[18:18:06] <supakeen> grym: For JSON there is only UTF-8 :)
[18:18:22] <galactoButterfly> I was reading that python 3 is utf-8 by default right?
[18:18:22] <relipse> ok you could just ignore me
[18:18:27] <Lartza> Well it sounds like you are using a program, yet haven't told us what that program is, so hard to say how to do it

[18:22:54] <galactoButterfly> I didn't write the program, I have a basic python knowledge..  If I try to paste the dog character directly I get this when trying to run it:  File "C:\Python310\lib\encodings\cp1252.py", line 23, in decode

[18:23:23] <grym> heeey it's not UTF8
[18:23:57] <grym> it's latin-1!
[18:24:35] <galactoButterfly> Its python 3 tho which i thought was UTF8 by default
[18:24:45] <supakeen> I don't think we see enough of that traceback yet to make sure the JSON is actually wrong.
[18:24:56] <grym> the file might be utf8, but locale's winning somewhere

The thing is if you install even one package with 'sudo', it's marked with root priveleges and any dependencies thereafter start complaining to use sudo everytime. If you keep things simple inside a venv. Such issues will not occur.

[23:45:50] <smrtz> Now I'm just trying to do some basic text parsing, to combine every three lines in a text file onto one line with commas delineating them. I've got https://bpa.st/3OVQ but it seems like the last line isn't doing what I'd like?
[23:45:56] <smrtz> I can post an example if that helps.
[23:47:07] <smrtz> I've got "a","b","c","d","e","f","g", and I'd like "a,b,c","d,e,f","g". But I'm getting "a,b,c","b,c,d","c,d,e"....

[23:50:17] <Repiphany> Or just change line 6 to `for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):`
[23:50:25] <smrtz> Bakunin I don't think so, it's printing the following three lines from the index, but it's not moving the index ahead 3 lines at the end?
[23:50:37] <Repiphany> i = i + 3 doesn't change what line 6 iterates over
[23:51:45] <smrtz> Repiphany yeah that's what I was afraid of.Â  I tried your second suggestion but it doesn't give any output.Â  Can you explain your first one a bit more please?

[23:52:56] <Forty-Bot> does anyone know what's going on here? https://paste.debian.net/1228047/
[23:52:59] <Repiphany> smrtz: Do you know slicing syntax
[23:53:08] <Forty-Bot> when running that code I get "TypeError: __class__ set to <class '__main__.Double'> defining 'Double' as <class '__main__.Double'>"
[23:53:09] <smrtz> Repiphany A bit.
[23:53:32] <Repiphany> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'][0:3] == ['a', 'b', 'c']
[23:53:40] <Forty-Bot> which comes from https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/bltinmodule.c#L235
[23:54:03] <Forty-Bot> but the classes are the same?
[23:54:07] <smrtz> But I worry what you posted would give "a,b,c", "b,c,d", "d,e,f" since I still won't be "skipping" the following two lines
[23:54:14] <Forty-Bot> so I don't know what's going on
[23:54:14] *** Quits: Elodin (~weechat@user/elodin) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:54:14] <Repiphany> So you want to slice your list with `lines[i:i+3]` but only for i equal to 0, 3, 6, 9, ...
[23:54:25] <smrtz> Oh, yeah that would work!
[23:54:36] <Forty-Bot> additionally, by replacing the body of __init__ with 'pass', the error goes away
[23:54:57] <Repiphany> => `range(0, len(lines), 3)` the 3 at the end gives you a range with spacing of 3
