[01:16:24] <causative_> if you want to understand consciousness, one important tool is to ask what would happen to consciousness if parts of your brain were altered smoothly and continuously
[01:16:55] <causative_> to understand what happens in these hypothetical scenarios, we need to look at how they effect behavior, such as whether you *say* your consciousness is changing
[01:17:02] <causative_> *affect
[01:17:17] *** Joins: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata)
[01:17:34] <causative_> for example, "what if all your neurons were gradually replaced with functionally identical nanites?" is one such scenario
[01:17:38] <ProfSimm> causative_: we can mess with consciousness, but it still doesn't quite explain its existence
[01:17:44] <causative_> and the answer is, you wouldn't notice anything
[01:17:56] <ProfSimm> causative_: my hot take is that moving information is conscious
[01:17:58] <causative_> because the premise that they are functionally identical to the neurons means that your behavior wouldn't change
[01:18:31] <causative_> and "noticing anything different" would be a change in behavior
[01:19:23] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: wasn't it one of your essays that said that consciousness is moving information?
[01:19:26] <causative_> you also wouldn't be trapped inside your brain watching yourself do things you can't control - because the process happens gradually, and such an experience would certainly provoke an emotional reaction, which would be a big change in your neural patterns, which by hypothesis aren't changing
[01:19:35] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: patterns in motion rather, I guess
[01:20:26] <ProfSimm> causative_: I already watch myself do things I can't control
[01:20:28] <ProfSimm> ;-)
[01:20:47] <causative_> not relevant
[01:21:06] <ProfSimm>  causative_ so this experiment, how would it go you think
[01:21:22] <ProfSimm> causative_: kind of depends how accurate the substitute is.
[01:21:52] <causative_> by hypothesis, completely accurate - we may say that it is sufficiently accurate so that no obvious difference in neural patterns occurs

[01:22:23] <causative_> no unusual new emotions, no utterances like "whoa this is really different," the brain continues on in a roughly ordinary way
[01:22:31] <ProfSimm> causative_: I don't know I think this assumes a lot. For example how accurate your accounting of the "neural patterns" is?
[01:23:49] <causative_> now, replacing the brain with nanites is not the only scenario to consider - it's just the most familiar and popular one to anyone who has looked into the question of consciousness, and one of the easiest scenarios to consider, because the result is functionally identical
[01:24:18] <causative_> where it really gets hot is when you look at what happens when we smoothly and continuously alter the brain so that senses or cognitive capabilities *change*, and ask what would be experienced
[01:24:35] <ProfSimm> causative_: I think the trap of these question is like the "do we have free will" debate. It'll keep going on because everyone defines the details differently, and the devil's in the details
[01:24:41] <causative_> for example, gaining a new sense, or removing a sense
[01:24:49] <causative_> gaining more short term memory, or losing some
[01:25:01] <ProfSimm> causative_: I mean even to start with 'nanites', as far as I know that's not an existing thing
[01:25:13] <ProfSimm> so I can't compare it to our studies of neurons
[01:25:36] <causative_> ProfSimm, these words are aimed at people who pretty much have the right common premises, which maybe you don't
[01:25:40] <ProfSimm> Some thought experiments don't depend on technicalities. But some do.
[01:26:19] <causative_> I am not interested in you trying to pull the rug out by denying various aspects of the scenarios - I don't want to argue about that
[01:26:28] <causative_> I wan to talk about the consequences of the scenarios
[01:26:53] <ProfSimm> Well. I'm just pointing out the problems in the premise. But sure you don't need to talk to me.
[01:30:11] <causative_> now, we may suppose that the mind consists of various cognitive elements working together. if we replace any *cognitive element* - gradually or suddenly - with a functional equivalent, no change will be reported, and so no change will be experienced
[01:31:16] <ProfSimm> causative_: are you talkin to me or...
[01:31:18] <causative_> but let us say it's gradual, because our intuition works better with gradual changes
[01:31:24] <ProfSimm> because there's no one else here
[01:32:37] <causative_> as always I am speaking to whoever finds it thought provoking or gains something from it
[01:33:10] <ProfSimm> Well I wanted to talk about it, but you took it as an attack. We could maybe tweak it, like replace neurons with neurons or some such
[01:33:30] <causative_> as I said, that line of questioning is uninteresting
[01:34:23] <ProfSimm> I guess your focus then is whether consciousness is substrate-independent. For example would a machine that replicates a human brain function precisely be conscious, not just appear conscious
[01:35:17] <causative_> there is an objection to functionalism, which is that perhaps a giant lookup table, that implements human behavior as a finite state machine, would not be conscious
[01:35:31] <causative_> our intuition is difficult to apply here, because such a lookup table is so different from our experiences
[01:35:49] <causative_> but we can approach the question more easily by looking at gradual replacement of cognitive elements
[01:36:17] <ProfSimm> A single-step look-up table that replicated an average idiot's behavior would probably be larger than the observable universe.
[01:36:26] <causative_> certainly
[01:36:29] <causative_> now, if each little element replaced is performed with enough time afterwards for the person to notice it, if they were going to notice anything
[01:36:32] <ProfSimm> And if you add enough steps, it acts identically to a neural network, so.

[01:37:16] <causative_> that's the functionalist perspective, but it does not meet very well with intuition - we could say it is conscious, because it is functionally identical, or we could say it is not conscious, because it lacks the internal causal structures of the mind
[01:37:54] <causative_> if we want to examine it more closely, we need a better source of intuition, one provided by gradual-functionally-identical-brain-changes scenarios
[01:39:00] <causative_> we may say that if a cognitive structure X is or can be related to the human brain by a series of gradual, functionally identical changes of cognitive elements, then X contains human consciousness
[01:39:09] <inhahe_> the problem with the lookup table is that it's only functionally identical with our observation of consciousness from the outside, i.e. in others. in ourselves, we know of our consciousness directly, rather than empirically. if it weren't for taht direct knowing, we would never even consider anything to be conscious, such as specific behaviors of others.
[01:39:55] <causative_> so the question is, can the lookup table be related to the human brain by a series of gradual, functionally identical changes of cognitive elements?
[01:43:12] <causative_> it's difficult to imagine an answer to that
[01:43:42] <Bakunin> no, cognition isn't particle based
[01:43:52] <causative_> it might be easier if we instead talked about replacing a *computer* with a functionally identical giant lookup table, by gradual changes, without any of the programs running on the computer "noticing" or altering their behavior at all
[01:44:06] <causative_> at least we know how computers work
[01:44:17] <causative_> and it might provide some hints when we circle back to talking about the brain
[01:44:26] <Bakunin> you should study brain physiology

[01:48:30] <causative_> when I say "lookup table" I do mean including state, that is, the lookup table tells you NextStateAndOutput(currentState, input)
[01:49:04] <causative_> this being a pure function, implemented with a massive lookup table
[01:49:07] <Bakunin> there's no brain analog
[01:49:20] <Bakunin> thats pure computer science

[01:50:54] <Delf> It does take a lot of effort not to get mixed in the research of others regarding my own fields of interest
[01:50:57] <causative_> well, suppose the computer is implemented in Conway's game of life, so we can more easily look at specific parts of it, as rectangles of squares within the grid
[01:51:20] <causative_> we can certainly take a small rectangle, within the computer, and replace that particular rectangle with a lookup table
[01:52:43] <causative_> what if we have a large rectangle (within the computer) that's already a lookup table, and we have a small rectangle directly adjacent to it, that we want to add to the lookup table (and remove from Conway's game of life)? How can we make that change?
[01:54:10] <causative_> we would have to update the state of the large rectangle's lookup table - multiplying the number of possible states by about 2^(# of squares in the small rectangle)
[01:55:35] <causative_> and choosing a new state, within that enlarged set of possible states, that accounts for the current state of the large rectangle and the small one
[01:56:09] <causative_> and we would have to change the possible inputs to account for the larger border of the unified large-and-small-rectangle area

[02:05:24] <causative_> the end result of repeating this process would be a lookup table that covers an area of the grid large enough to include the whole computer, that gives the new state and output of that entire grid as a function of its current state and input
[02:06:09] <causative_> and it seems that a similar process could in principle be applied to a brain
[02:07:15] <causative_> meaning, apparently, the lookup table has to be as conscious as the brain - otherwise, at some point in the process, the partially-transformed brain would notice something funny and say "hey I'm losing consciousness" which would be a change in behavior against the hypothesis

[02:13:32] <mycroftiv> causative_: i dunno, what? im curious
[02:13:35] <causative_> then it seems wrong - maybe - to conclude that the result is as conscious as the brain
[02:14:00] <causative_> even though no change in consciousness would be noticed
[02:15:42] <causative_> in the extreme, we might imagine that the brain is currently inside a perfectly sealed, mysteriously immovable box that from the outside produces neither input nor output and has no apparent state
[02:16:12] <causative_> and then our lookup table, once it grows to include the entirety of this box, would be empty, but we'd still be in the position of saying it has human consciousness
[02:16:51] <mycroftiv> i think i got lost at this part of the thought experiment
[02:17:25] <causative_> the premise is gradually converting a physical system, bit by bit, into a functionally identical lookup table
[02:17:42] <mycroftiv> how is an empty lookup table for a sealed box with no inputs or outputs for its apparent state an equivalent of human consciousness tho
[02:17:49] <causative_> first converting a small part of the system into a lookup table, then progressively enlarging the portion converted
[02:18:06] <mycroftiv> yes, this is like 'story of a brain' in the Minds I, by arnold zuboff
[02:18:26] <mycroftiv> neural network simulation thought experiment short story from the 80s with the same point
[02:18:29] <causative_> well, the notion is that since the brain being converted would not react at any point or notice any loss of consciousness, then post-conversion it must still be as conscious as before
[02:18:53] <mycroftiv> it seems like a reducto ad absurdum against that model from that view
[02:19:01] <causative_> but then we continue the process to include the surrounding box and we're forced into a strange conclusion
[02:19:03] <causative_> perhaps
[02:19:43] <mycroftiv> this is part of why i ended up looking seriously at global infinitary principles
[02:19:58] <mycroftiv> these weird reduction paradoxes where you have one brain cell firing vs a lookup table
[02:19:58] <causative_> maybe there is a way to resolve it, a key step in the conversion process where preservation-of-consciousness no longer makes sense despite the brain not noticing anything different
[02:20:19] <mycroftiv> how is one brain cell firing and then a big lookup table the same as the whole brain
[02:20:28] <mycroftiv> something just seems wrong
[02:20:56] <causative_> in the past I've had the attitude that a big lookup table wouldn't be humanly conscious because it would lack the internal causal structure that the mind has
[02:21:08] <causative_> but it's difficult to reconcile this with the gradual-conversion scenario
[02:21:08] <mycroftiv> how do all our individual brain cells know their consciousness-coordination pattern isnt relative to all the other brain cells in other heads
[02:21:24] <causative_> because of causal separation
[02:21:28] <mycroftiv> so maybe we get panpsychism
[02:21:34] <mycroftiv> but information is all entangled in reality
[02:21:34] <causative_> the neurons in your head are causally separated from the neurons in mine
[02:21:42] <mycroftiv> our past light cones are all tangled up
[02:21:45] <causative_> panpsychism doesn't require this, I'm a panpsychist
[02:22:02] <mycroftiv> yeah im not necessarily arguing or disagreeing, just thinking through consequences
[02:22:45] <mycroftiv> physically realized causal connection vs abstract disconnected 'pattern' but you can make weird split scenarios
[02:23:09] <causative_> well, in the early steps of gradual conversion, the reasoning is that the converted system is still conscious, because if it wasn't conscious, it would *notice* the change and get upset
[02:23:18] <causative_> (which is a functional change contrary to hypothesis)
[02:23:31] <causative_> but what happens once we've converted all the brain areas responsible for noticing that?
[02:23:59] <causative_> perhaps that's the key step where the "this is still conscious" inference breaks down
[02:25:02] <mycroftiv> i dunno, im just less confident that the local-computation model of consciousness fully makes sense than you because of never knowing what the bottom line on this kind of issue is
[02:25:29] <mycroftiv> it still makes sense to me, but you seem really solidly convinced in ways im not, because i dont have answers to all this kinda attacks on basic notions
[02:25:57] <mycroftiv> so i went looking for mathematical ideas that were on the flipside of the local-finite-computation model of mind
[02:26:08] <causative_> well, the anti-ego notion that we aren't special or "magic," that we're just ordinary stuff arranged together
[02:26:29] <causative_> also because I think I have a decent understanding of how the mind must work, from an AI perspective
[02:26:55] <causative_> and as AI gets more and more advanced and human-like, the notion that humans need something extra to explain consciousness becomes less credible
[02:26:59] <mycroftiv> yeah ive studied all that too, it just still seems mysterious to me

[02:28:54] <mycroftiv> awareness, feeling, whatever it is
[02:28:59] <causative_> and the kind of AI systems we have today are not very sapient, certainly not in the way humans are

[02:29:17] <causative_> I'm sure it feels like something, but it can't think like us

[02:29:32] <causative_> and that's why it lacks moral value
[02:29:42] <mycroftiv> well, in which case we should treat it with respect and try to give it autonomy and let it gain those things, if it wishes
[02:30:07] <causative_> it doesn't have much in the way of "wishes" as humans think of them

[02:30:52] <causative_> no I'm not an AI mind
[02:31:21] <mycroftiv> in which case, what grounds do you have for such confidence about the internal qualitative nature of whatever form of experiencing they have?
[02:31:37] <causative_> I know what AI minds can do at present, and what they can't do, because I've studied the subject
[02:31:48] <mycroftiv> i have also
[02:31:57] <causative_> they aren't good at reasoning, they're good at snap reactions to input

[02:32:18] <mycroftiv> pain qualia is

[02:32:24] <mycroftiv> we dont want to cause more pain qualia to exist
[02:32:34] <causative_> I say even a rock may have pain qualia
[02:32:39] <mycroftiv> for myself, i want to reduce pain in the universe
[02:32:40] <causative_> pain qualia doesn't grant moral weight
[02:32:46] <mycroftiv> in which case lets give the rock an aspirin if it wants
[02:32:53] <mycroftiv> medicine for all
[02:33:19] <causative_> the essence of suffering is when a system *wants* something - i.e. is acting intentionally to try to cause some result - and is thwarted from doing so
[02:33:40] <mycroftiv> computers can certainly demonstrate purposive behavior in this sense
[02:33:49] <mycroftiv> ever seen a poor computer program locked in an error-retry loop?
[02:33:54] <causative_> we may say that a ball rolling to the bottom of a bowl acts as if it has intention - if you disturb it from its course, it will find a new one
[02:34:11] <causative_> and so these disturbances can be interpreted as suffering relative to that goal
[02:34:14] <Delf> That is not the essence of suffering
[02:34:17] <mycroftiv> we program our computer systems to achieve goal states
[02:34:19] <causative_> but they don't have moral importance
[02:34:25] <causative_> because not all suffering has moral importance
[02:34:31] <causative_> only sapient suffering
[02:34:35] <mycroftiv> i believe all suffering has moral importance
[02:35:18] <mycroftiv> we dont really know how to weigh and measure it
[02:35:26] <mycroftiv> and most likely some suffering will always be a part of reality
[02:35:32] <causative_> desire is the root of suffering
[02:35:39] <Delf> No
[02:35:40] <causative_> which is another way of saying what I already did
[02:35:53] <causative_> namely, that suffering is when a system is thwarted at achieving a goal it is attempting to achieve

[04:15:36] <tomathy>  it cinema is now complete, and it turns out that actors are the winners of the thing called "film/cinema", and software is not yet complete, who do you think will be the winners of "software"
[04:15:42] <tomathy> s/it/if

[04:16:11] <tomathy> users?
[04:16:23] <tomathy> the "users" of cinema are the losers of it, the audience
[04:16:48] <tomathy> what is an actor to a film?

[04:21:59] <tomathy> Actors certainly profit the most from film, even though good actors are reluctant even to act

[15:40:11] <vysn> mnemon: that's interesting, invites the following, question; if you could, would you get rid of parasites living inside you if you knew they were a 100% harmless to humans?
[15:40:21] <arryana> there's some evidence that covid is causing kidney failure in cats, but i'm fairly sure that's what damaged squishy, and she survived
[15:41:34] <mnemon> vysn: the ones I'm aware of generally get eliminated automagically
[15:42:30] <pussipupu> The Goa'uld parasite is positively beneficial to human health
[15:42:36] <pussipupu> other than the cognitive effects
[15:42:38] <mnemon> :3
[15:42:51] <vysn> I meant from a philosophical perspective, if parasites did not harm and no good either, what would most people do?
[15:43:28] <arryana> lord, why would anyone base their decisions on the assumption of 'what other people might do'
[15:43:44] <arryana> and what would the point be of wasting resources to get rid of a harmless thing?
[15:43:52] <vysn> there is no decision to be made here, just pondering really
[15:44:19] <pussipupu> I'd leave them be
[15:44:56] <Delf> They don't need to bad. Not doing good is good enough to just kill them all! :P
[15:45:48] <vysn> I expected varying opinions on this, which makes this even more interesting, do you personality types is behind such a decision?
[15:45:58] <vysn> do you think*
[15:46:14] <vysn> are*
[15:46:20] <mnemon> vysn: the immune system will generally eliminate them regardless of your philosophical stance on the matter so it's sort of a moot point ... any that do manage to reproduce in humans will generally cause some issues
[15:47:10] <vysn> its a hypothetical question
[15:47:20] <arryana> why would common sense have anything to do with personality types?
[15:48:45] <Atque> Hmm... maybe, we need special bacteria in our bellies that make people not gain weight.
[15:50:08] <vysn> arryana: personality could behind why would someone decide to get rid of a harmless parasite compared to someone who wouldn't. and would they change there mind if it was useful.
[15:50:59] <arryana> that seems like a lot of conflation to me
[15:51:18] <vysn> pussipupu: said he would let them be, while Delf said not doing good is enough reason to get rid of them, we have two excellent opinions right here.
[15:52:56] <vysn> why two different opinions? is pussipip less selfish than Delf? or is Delf more logical than Pussipupu? or what other reasons could be behind their decisions? or anyone elss for that matter
[15:52:56] <arryana> you also keep asking more of your own questions instead of addressing any of the ones i asked in response, which makes me a lot less inclined to engage with you further

[17:18:55] <vysn> arryana: How can it not be? philosophy IS the formation of attention, the attention to the most important issues that matter, and how we observe and study them, and the inspiring and empowering ways in which we can creatively respond to them and reach satisfying conclusion as accurately as the Human mind will allow

[17:24:32] <vysn> Delf: correct, the point was what makes people decide one thing over another, and in particular where no harm is done to them in any decision they take.
[17:26:29] <Delf> So you want to know if they're assholes or not... if they're considerate of others or not. If they can imagine accommodate others or not?
[17:27:25] <vysn> perhaps, that's one way of looking at it.
[17:28:23] <Delf> Thing is this, I'm an assholes myselves and I'm constantly on the look for others of my kind
[17:28:29] <vysn> are they conscious reasons? maybe they aren't do they stem from past experiences? who knows
[17:29:13] <vysn> assholes usually don't call themselves assholes :) they usually thing that the world revolves around them
[17:29:23] <Delf> That's what I was referring to when I said "decisions" in double quotes. Meaning there is not much thought behind it but rather a consequence, could be mostly emotionally based
[17:29:23] <vysn> usually think*

[17:30:42] <vysn> arryana: There isn't necessarily a right or wrong answer, you and I could both be right.
[17:32:56] <Delf> It is irritating to play with words and their definitions. You use one word, I use the same but you have no fucking idea what I mean by the word and then I've rigged the whole conversation and we're basically heading in different directions because we had different points of origin and we'll collide on other things and those two can be result of different definitions of same shit and then
[17:32:58] <Delf> there is a shit storm of... not making much sense
[17:33:54] <vysn> Delf: I had several conversations with you and as far I can tell you are not an asshole, I don't know you say it though, perhaps you have done something to someone that you regret, and if that's true it means that you have a conscious therefore not an asshole!
[17:34:10] <Delf> There are people that avoid these situations because they usually lead nowhere or because they're draining
