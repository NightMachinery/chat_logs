[19:37:54] <kittonian> hi all. anyone familiar with dovecot and rspamd? i can't seem to find a straight answer on why my sieve scripts seem to be running just fine according to dovecot's logs, but rspamd isn't actually updating it's bayes learning or fuzzy storage
[19:38:15] <kittonian> i can run the commands in the script from the command line and rspamd trains just fine
[19:38:42] <kittonian> and when I move a message into the spam folder dovecot's debug log shows that the sieve scripts are being executed without error
[19:45:32] <lunaphyte> when you run the scripts manually, does rspamd provide any logging?
[19:45:59] *** Quits: pj (~pj@ghettoforge/pj) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[19:46:17] <kittonian> unfortunately not that i've seen
[19:46:51] <lunaphyte> if it were me, that's what i'd get fixed first
[19:47:12] <lunaphyte> how is one supposed to debug issues with rspamd, if rspamd doesn't reveal what's happening?
[19:47:31] <kittonian> i don't think it's an rspamd issue if rspamd works just fine from the command line
[19:47:38] <lunaphyte> maybe
[19:47:40] <kittonian> i would think it's a dovecot issue
[19:48:01] <dminuoso> yes, no, maybe
[19:48:07] <dminuoso> Share some config for starters?
[19:48:09] <lunaphyte> who knows, since rspamd doesn't even log when expected outcomes occur
[19:48:20] <dminuoso> Honestly, this is one of those things you shouldnt flip on until you have a thorough understanding of all the moving parts
[19:48:34] <kittonian> thanks, i have a good understanding of all the moving parts
[19:48:36] <dminuoso> You can make it log
[19:48:44] <kittonian> rspamd is logging
[19:48:56] <kittonian> i said I didn't notice an entry for when the command is run manually
[19:50:07] <dminuoso> Anyway, I think its a dovecot issue too.
[19:50:36] <kittonian> from the command line you run rspamd blah blah learn_spam filename
[19:50:40] <dminuoso> You usually only call `rspamc learn_ham` and `rspamc learn_spam`, so if those invocation are handled properly, then dovecot is not executing them
[19:50:46] <lunaphyte> the nuance when two things talk to each other is that ruling one out doesn't implicate the other.  the relationship between the two is a third implicit element.  that's why logging nominal activity is a requirement
[19:50:46] <kittonian> but in a sieve script there is no filename
[19:51:01] <kittonian> it's supposed to use the message that was moved into the folder as the filename
[19:51:02] <dminuoso> I think in sieve its being fed via STDIN
[19:51:06] <lunaphyte> then it
[19:51:39] <lunaphyte> s probably standard in, and if you're running it with a filename, that won't be accurately reproducing with dovecot is doing
[19:51:47] <lunaphyte> so not a valid test case
[19:51:58] <kittonian> there's no other way to run it manually
[19:52:01] <dminuoso> kittonian: You can set `logging = "debug"` in your logging.inc
[19:52:09] <dminuoso> keep in mind this will produce absurd amounts of logs
[19:52:31] <dminuoso> Possibly `info` might be enough
[19:52:49] <kittonian> i turned on debug logging in dovecot and saw it executing the sieve scripts and running the commands with no errors
[19:52:59] <dminuoso> Then tune logging in rspamd
[19:53:04] <kittonian> but the numbers don't update in rspamd
[19:53:18] <kittonian> but if I manually scan/learn in rspamd that same message, the numbers update
[19:53:30] <kittonian> and if I manually run the learn command from the command line, the numbers update
[19:53:35] <dminuoso> Yes. Enable logging in rspamd
[19:55:54] <dminuoso> Also, can you share your dovecot config + sieve script?

[21:24:08] <dminuoso> kittonian: Looks perfectly right
[21:36:41] <kittonian> dminuoso, yup
[21:37:00] <kittonian> but i'm dealing with another major issue at the moment and could really use some help
[21:37:29] <kittonian> after training bayes (spam and ham with over 75k messages) rspamd started erroring because of out of memory errors due to redis
[21:37:53] <kittonian> even though redis is configured for volatile_ttl usage which means it should just delete the oldest message and keep going forever
[21:38:06] <dminuoso> rspamd is *littered* with all kinds of memory bugs
[21:38:09] <kittonian> so I had no choice but to do a flushall which means I just lost everything from my bayes training,e tc.
[21:38:14] <dminuoso> to the point I'd be scared on running rspamd on any server that has mails on it.,
[21:38:21] <dminuoso> It's not even funny

[21:39:04] <dminuoso> Close to a hundred segmentation fault bugs alone.
[21:39:12] <kittonian> well, i've invested a lot of time in this so far and I'd rather not ditch it all and switch back to spamassassin if possible
[21:39:14] <dminuoso> The amount of "lets handroll this ourselves in C" is crazy
[21:40:15] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@200.5.63.76) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[21:41:06] <dminuoso> kittonian: Are you running bayes expiry?
[21:41:36] <dminuoso> And how many tokens was that?
[21:41:51] <dminuoso> Expiry should really only be done from inside rspamd for so many reasons
[21:41:59] <dminuoso> Take a look at https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/bayes_expiry.html
[21:42:25] <kittonian> i don't want bayes to expire
[21:42:33] <kittonian> i want redis not to take a dump on me
[21:42:46] <dminuoso> You should want bayes to expire
[21:43:08] <dminuoso> The amount of tokens stored is crazy high, and spam flavour constantly changes.
[21:43:39] <dminuoso> By expiring old bayes tokens, you forget about old spam fingerprints no longer in use, which could otherwise bring up false positive rates
[21:44:01] <dminuoso> Heck, if you run neural you should even have two trains
[21:44:08] <dminuoso> One short lived and one long lived
[21:44:19] <dminuoso> And the performance issue, obviously
[21:44:22] <kittonian> i do have that for neural
[21:44:26] <kittonian> the short and long
[21:44:51] <dminuoso> Also, bayes expiry is good for another reason
[21:44:53] <kittonian> ok, so when training bayes should I only train it with current messages? i was training with messages from 2017 to today
[21:45:05] <dminuoso> false positive detection will otherwise over time skew your bayes classification
[21:45:16] <kittonian> ok, so use my 2021 stuff only
[21:45:18] <kittonian> cool
[21:45:20] <dminuoso> kittonian: The best thing to do is to train with rejection.
[21:45:35] <dminuoso> That is, completely auto training based on say everything you hard reject
[21:45:57] <dminuoso> I would even exclude the "move into spam" folder logic for a few reasons
[21:46:02] <dminuoso> users tend to be usually quite horrible in detecting spam
[21:46:23] <kittonian> there aren't "users". it's myself and my wife
[21:46:25] <dminuoso> Say, they will happily move solicited ham/ads into spam, and this will heavily skew your false positive rate
[21:46:27] <kittonian> this is for our use only
[21:46:29] <dminuoso> ah then its not a big deal
[21:47:29] <kittonian> ok, the first thing I need to resolve is after doing the flushall to get it back and working, I am getting fuzzy update: cannot insert 00007F7599301480, key: [::1]/128, duplicate value
[21:47:42] <dminuoso> kittonian: Consider another thing: You constantly tweak your settings for one reason or another because of false/positive rates. So expiry helps avoid this leaking into your baye sdetection
[21:47:50] <kittonian> and I tried doing a redis-cli --scan to show all the keys but I can't find any dupliate
[21:48:09] <kittonian> ok, i'm taking your advice and will setup the classifier
[21:48:18] <kittonian> if you don't mind, can we take this one step at a time?
[21:48:31] <kittonian> first I would like to fix the duplicate value error
[21:48:34] <dminuoso> fuzzy is stored in an sqlite database
[21:48:47] <dminuoso> https://rspamd.com/doc/workers/fuzzy_storage.html
[21:48:49] <kittonian> i don't have sqlite. it's being stored in redis
[21:48:53] <dminuoso> mmm
[21:48:55] <kittonian> the backend is redis
[21:49:00] <kittonian> you can change it from sqlite
[21:49:22] <dminuoso> Oh, I guess so
[21:49:30] <dminuoso> Didn't know :)
[21:49:41] <kittonian> look at that. i taught you something :)
[21:50:02] <dminuoso> Being good just means you are good at what know, not good at everything. :)
[21:50:14] <kittonian> absolutely. story of my life
[21:50:34] <dminuoso> honestly I wonder whether you have a broken version of rspamd there
[21:50:43] <kittonian> no
[21:50:50] <kittonian> it's been working really well for over a month now
[21:50:57] <kittonian> these errors just appeared after doing the flushall
[21:51:02] <dminuoso> Well yeah
[21:51:04] <kittonian> otherwise, things are doing great
[21:52:12] <dminuoso> rspamd keeps internal state for a bunch of things
[21:52:22] <dminuoso> So yeah, flushall probably wasnt a great idea
[21:52:51] <kittonian> tell me about it. found a doc that said this is what you do to fix the out of memory error and I'm so sorry I did it
[21:52:58] <dminuoso> You can probably delete everything in your rspamd directory
[21:53:06] <dminuoso> While rspamd is shut down, of course
[21:53:10] <dminuoso> Backup to be sure
[21:53:19] <kittonian> what do mean delete everything?
[21:53:28] <dminuoso> `rm /var/lib/rspamd/*` or some such
[21:53:34] <kittonian> this is docker
[21:53:47] <dminuoso> So?
[21:53:52] <dminuoso> docker is not a magical black box
[21:54:05] <dminuoso> Also, is this mailcow?
[21:54:21] <kittonian> no
[21:54:31] <dminuoso> well just docker exec into your container and cleanse it
[21:54:39] <dminuoso> its just going to be annoying beccause rspamd shouldnt be running
[21:54:42] <kittonian> i mean, /var/lib/rspamd is mapped to /server/data/mail/rspamd
[21:54:50] <dminuoso> well that's easy the
[21:55:06] <kittonian> my conf stuff is mapped to /server/conf/mail/rspamd
[21:55:23] <dminuoso> Well yeah, cleanse your /server/data/mail/rspamd then
[21:55:29] <dminuoso> As long as you have everything in redis
[21:55:41] <kittonian> what does that do exactly?

[21:58:36] <dminuoso> well, probably you're fine with just deleting symbosl.cache and that rspamd.rrd file that does things (no clue, several thousand lines of undocumented code, and no external documentation describing it)
[21:58:39] <kittonian> i backed up that directory and deleted everything with rspamd stopped and then started it
[21:58:44] <kittonian> didn't solve the duplicate key problem

[22:01:01] <kittonian> i just put everything back because it didn't like that too much and I lost my historical data
