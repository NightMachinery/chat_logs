"git submodule update --init --recursive ./correct-path" works, and fixes the general error of init/update/recursive for ALL subomdules failing on the non-existent submodule.)

[09:14:38] <ebeip90> @jmcantrell I've updated the Gist several times now, and found a workaround.  It appears that there is somewhere-other-than-.gitmodules that Git keeps track of submodules (even on a fresh clone, so not ~/.git/config).  I also found a work-around, but I still don't understand the WHY of the original issue.  Even "git rm -rf .prezto" complained: "warning: Could not find section in .gitmodules where path=.prezto"

[16:40:48] <ross> hi all. in a bit of a pickle here. I've got a ~50 commit pr and I've decided that actually, instead of having this pr adding a feature to this repository, I want to move this feature to its own repository. what I'd like to do is interactively rebase this branch onto a branch in the new repository and work from there, dealing with conflicts as they come up - but I've no idea if rebasing cross-repository is possible. any tips on what I should do here?
[16:45:06] <ross> one thing I've tried is adding the old repository as a remote then (from a new branch in the new repository) `git merge old-repo/feature-branch` but of course am met with "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
[16:48:48] <ross> should I just fork the old repository and just delete the history that I don't want?

[17:40:34] <Timvde> ross: you can add --allow-unrelated-histories (I think, I'm on my phone and don't have a man page nearby), but I don't think you want a merge?
[17:41:04] <ross> good to know that flag exists, thank you - I don't think I do, no
[17:41:24] <ross> I think I *probably* want a lot of cherry-picks and that's just a rebase?
[17:41:37] <Timvde> You can rebase the brancy if it doesn't continue on previous worj, but that's unlikely?

[17:42:33] <ross> there are a few commits that do continue on previous work, but most of them just change files added in that branch - I'm hoping to fix/ignore these as I come across them, hence why I initially assumed I'd need an interactive rebase
[17:42:44] *** Joins: dslegends (~dslegends@user/dslegends)
[17:43:21] <ross> the commits that do continue on previous work I hope to (in the old repository) extract out to a new branch and merge that once I've removed all the feature commits
[17:44:06] <ross> I suppose I could do that now to purge all the 'dirty' commits from the feature branch, and then try a rebase?
[17:44:31] <Timvde> It sounda like it would maybe be easier to just copy and recreate the history
[17:45:04] <Timvde> But you can definitely add the repository as a separate remote and just use cherry-pick, rebase, filter-branch etc as much as you want
[17:45:49] <ross> mmmm. yes I think you might be right
[17:46:03] <Timvde> Just be prepared for conflict misery :)
[17:46:08] <ross> alright, I'll change the new repo to a fork and do what I must
[17:46:14] <ross> thanks for your advice!

[19:38:21] <Oblomov> oh this is an interesting question
[19:38:50] <Oblomov> let's say that I'm doing a largish rebase, and to make sure all intermediate commits compile, I do a git rebase -x make
[19:39:10] *** Quits: LuKaRo_ (~LuKaRo@p4fc32257.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[19:39:13] <Oblomov> halfway through the rebase I get a commit that doesn't build, and it turns out that it should be skipped
[19:39:30] <Oblomov> I cannot use git rebase --skip because it skips the make command. so what do I do?
[19:39:42] <Oblomov> (the commit applies cleanly, of course, otherwise there would be no issue)
