[00:44:16] <ectospasm> Is there a way to pin tabs?  Preferably some tabs don't need a title, if all I see is the favicon that is good enough for me.
[00:45:03] <Ingvix> ectospasm, :tab-pin or ctrl+p
[00:45:29] <Ingvix> it hides the title by default for pinned tabs
[00:46:52] <ectospasm> Ingvix: Yep, that's exactly what I want!  It's not on the default keybindings cheat sheet, though.  
[00:48:12] <Ingvix> ectospasm, :bind without arguments opens a page with all your current bindings
[00:48:30] <ectospasm> Ingvix: good to know!
[00:50:46] <ectospasm> I finally used LastPass to log into Google in qutebrowser.  I had to modify my LastPass record so the proper entry would show up.  I also had to modify qute-lastpass so it would show the username before the URL (some of my entries for Google are so long I couldn't see which username they were for otherwise).
[00:51:06] <ectospasm> I also installed rofi, seems dmenu by default only shows one line.
[00:51:47] <ectospasm> I have too many Google accounts.
[00:51:48] <Ingvix> yeah, dmenu requires an argument to use more lines
[00:52:30] <ectospasm> I use dmenu in quit a few places already, but they're all set up automatically so I couldn't remember that option off the top of my head.
[00:52:54] <ectospasm> rofi works well enough, I'll have to look into setting its color scheme later.
[00:53:13] <ectospasm> The default color scheme for rofi is close enough to mine, for now.
[00:58:11] <ectospasm> Does qutebrowser have a vimscript-compatible .vimrc configuration?  In vim I have some imap and nmap bindings, and at least for insert mode I'd like to be able to use those.
[00:58:39] <ectospasm> Things like `imap jj <Esc>` to go back to command/normal mode while in insert mode by typing 'jj'
[00:59:16] <ectospasm> I have quite a bit of those, and remembering to hit Esc is a bit off the home row.
[01:00:19] <Ingvix> I'm not aware of any tool that would convert them to the qb's python format especially since a lot of things differ between vim and qb
[01:00:34] <Ingvix> like function-wise
[01:01:16] <Ingvix> you need to set those yourself in config.py or in the browser
[01:10:26] <ectospasm> Yep, :help :bind is useful, as well as the documentation in qute://settings
[01:10:54] <ectospasm> I just bound 'jj' to mode-leave in insert mode!  It works *exactly* as desired!
[01:11:12] <ectospasm> Now for the rest of my little tricks.
[01:14:23] <ectospasm> Yep, and they all show up in :bind once I've set them!  This is so cool!
[01:21:14] <ectospasm> Ohh, I just ran into a bug. There's no timeout if repeated keys are entered, so if I'm not triggering one of my mode-leave shortcuts, it waits indefinitely for the rest of the shortcut.  This is blocking me from typing the letters that constitute my shortcuts.
[01:21:27] <ectospasm> How do I remove keybindings?
[01:21:43] <ectospasm> I'd need to remove these to be able to type certain letters.
[01:21:49] <ectospasm> in insert mode.
[01:22:58] <Ingvix> :unbind
[01:23:29] <ectospasm> Yep, I just found that.  Thanks!
[01:23:51] <Ingvix> yeah, those kind of bindings don't currently work in qb's insert mode
[01:25:59] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: not really a bug, more of a missing feature. There is an issue open about it.
[01:26:45] <ectospasm> There is?  OK, I'll have to find it later.  Got a CPR class to attend far away in about five minutes.
[01:27:03] <ectospasm> Or, leaving in about five minutes.
[01:27:53] <ectospasm> I would think it'd be as simple as adding a timeout if the rest of the keys in a keychain aren't pressed within the timeout, just type the letters pressed so far.
[01:28:34] <ectospasm> I may have some time tomorrow to look at it.  I know a little Python so maybe I can submit a patch?  We'll see if I can figure it out.
[01:29:32] <The-Compiler> It's not that simple, someone took a stab at it a while back
[01:30:02] <The-Compiler> It involves generating artificial key press events to send to the website and there was some issue with that not working IIRC
[01:30:35] <ectospasm> Ahhh, OK
[01:31:08] <ectospasm> I would think the timer could start when the event loop that looks for keychains starts.
[01:31:26] <ectospasm> Or at least, when it starts detecting a keychain.
[01:33:11] <ectospasm> vim handles it reasonably well, whenever it starts detecting a keychain, it waits for the rest of the chain.  If it doesn't get the rest within about 500ms, it prints what's typed so far.  It sounds like that latter piece is what they couldn't get working.
[01:33:28] <ectospasm> How does qb pass letters typed usually?
[01:33:34] <The-Compiler> It does nor
[01:33:36] <The-Compiler> not
[01:34:06] <The-Compiler> It either filters and handles them, or it ignores them and lets Qt handle them
[01:35:03] <ectospasm> So without these special insert mode keychains, it's Qt that handles the typed text?
[01:36:11] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: if a key isn't bound in qutebrowser, it's handled by Qt
[01:36:47] <The-Compiler> crash_: v3.0.0 with Qt 6, which shouldn't be too far off

[01:37:32] <ectospasm> Ahh, so if qutebrowser starts filtering the keychain, it's currently waiting for the rest of the chain, it has no way to give it back to Qt for Qt to enter the text.
[01:38:04] <The-Compiler> Yup
[01:38:05] <ectospasm> I know nothing of Qt, so I wouldn't know where to begin.
[01:38:27] <rak> c/7
[01:38:31] <rak> Oops
[01:39:42] <ectospasm> But surely it has to somehow hand it over to Qt in the first place?
[01:39:43] <The-Compiler> Yeah it's a lot trickier than it seems unfortunately, as qutebrowser doesn't control those keys alone
