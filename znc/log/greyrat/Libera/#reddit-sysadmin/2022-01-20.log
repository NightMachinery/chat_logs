[00:06:35] <signofzeta> thanks, fritzwastaken. there goes the last of my lunch break.
[00:07:14] <fritzwastaken> lol
[00:07:40] <fritzwastaken> "There's a man on YT that weight around 420lb and his wife is around 300lb. During one of his streams he explained how he have sex, he said doggy style but he needs to use his wife lower back as a table for his belly since it almost reach his thigh."
[00:07:47] * fritzwastaken shudders
[00:08:17] <signofzeta> A good friend of mine is over 500 pounds. I never asked this because he hasn't gotten laid since the Obama administration.
[00:08:34] <fritzwastaken> s/Obama/Reagan
[00:08:34] <layer8> signofzeta meant: "A good friend of mine is over 500 pounds. I never asked this because he hasn't gotten laid since the Reagan administration."

[00:09:42] <fritzwastaken> "She would lay on her back on the side of the bed with each foot resting on a kitchen chair and would then take a 2x4 wooden board and holding each end of the board use it to pull her belly out of the way. Her husband would then stand between the chairs and do the deed."

[00:29:18] <vinrock> vlc is the bomb
[00:29:32] <vinrock> cept that one time they packed a dropper in the install file
[00:29:39] <vinrock> other than that theyre cool
[00:34:44] <yuken> Dropper?
[00:34:52] <yuken> I've been using mpv for awhile, haven't touched vlc.
[00:37:48] <vinrock> well mightve not been a dropper
[00:37:55] <vinrock> i just remeber vlc instaler had some shit in it a while back
[00:38:13] <vinrock> ive still used it for the past 20 years or so, so w/e
[00:40:26] <mistiry> vlc is bae
[00:42:28] <vinrock> i recently discoverd the interactive zoom feature in vlc
[00:42:44] <vinrock> very nice for reviewing security cam footage instad of using the nvr software or browser console
[00:43:37] <signofzeta> yeah, I had a customer send me four blurry pictures of her docking station's underside, but only the video had a clear-enough picture to actually read the serial number.  zoomed in with VLC.
[00:44:40] <signofzeta> the only reason I paid for the HEIC/HEVC add-ins for Windows (on my Windows computer) was so I could edit HEIC images in Paint.NET (my favorite Windows photo editor).
[00:44:57] <signofzeta> plus, I submitted the 99 cents as a business expense and got reimbursed in full
[00:46:29] *** Quits: arlion (~arlion@user/arlion) ()
[00:46:38] <sintax> heic annoys me.
[00:46:40] <sintax> thanks apple
[00:48:32] <signofzeta> if not HEIC, it would have been JPEG 2000, JPEG XL, AVIF, WebP or WebP 2... there are enough image formats out there these days.  the HTML5 <picture> tag is getting massive.
[00:48:47] <sintax> i've no doubt. 
[00:48:52] <sintax> but how many do we really need?
[00:49:07] <signofzeta> we only need The Next Big Thing to get us through to the next version of The Next Big Thing.
[00:49:20] <sintax> png and jpeg are good enough for me
[00:49:55] <signofzeta> too bad we didn't have AVIF back in the dial-up days.  You can get an image down to 56k-friendly sizes.  too bad it wouldn't have been possible to decode on a 486.
[00:49:57] <CptLuxx> fuck heic
[00:50:39] <signofzeta> Apple went all-in on H.265 (HEVC), so no wonder they pushed the MPEG Group's image format as well.
[00:51:21] <sintax> it's just annoying they want you to buy the codec.
[00:51:33] <sintax> but i've had luck installing vlc media player and the codec in there lets you see the photos. 
[00:51:36] <sintax> i think
[00:51:37] <signofzeta> funny, because I get HEIC/HEVC on Linux and macOS for free
[00:51:54] <sintax> Yup. Windows just need to license the codec.
[00:52:00] <sintax> but they don't because it's a competitor
[00:52:07] <sintax> and now MS owns activision
[00:52:07] <signofzeta> I don't know, but it might be Sarbanes-Oxley, the same reason Apple used to charge for iPod OS software updates.
[00:52:14] <sintax> true
[00:52:18] <vinrock> i got the codec also and i still cant open the fuckers in windows or photoshop
[00:52:19] <sintax> MS is getting weird.
[00:52:25] <signofzeta> there's always AVC-1 and AVIF
[00:52:27] <vinrock> if i get sent a heic i just tell the person to stop 
[00:52:45] <sintax> you can change the photo format on iphones
[00:52:49] <sintax> but it's annoying 
[00:52:58] <vinrock> i hate when people send me iphone photos
[00:53:05] <sintax> "live" photos
[00:53:06] <sintax> no
[00:53:12] <sintax> if i wanted a live photo i'd ask for a video
[00:53:17] <vinrock> i use the flicks for ptinting promo mats, trade show displays, etc
[00:53:25] <vinrock> you blow up an iphone photo at all and its all fucking weird
[00:53:37] <vinrock> like the iphone does a bunch of shit to the pics that make them look like blotches
[00:53:49] <vinrock> they look fantastic on a tiny screen, blow em up and theyre hot garbage
[00:53:53] <sintax> yeah it's weird.
[00:53:54] <signofzeta> yeah, Live Photos are largely useless.  I guess it's great for Little Timmy's first steps, but for the average fuck sending a picture of a screenshot, people need to hit the "No Live Photo" option.
[00:54:17] <fritzwastaken> I use it for getting specific pictures of my cat..
[00:54:37] <sintax> fritzwastaken: that's a good use case. 
[00:54:43] <sintax> but most photos you don't need it and it's dumb.
[00:54:54] <signofzeta> that's a good use case for Live Photos: changing the "default picture" because cat photos are always... fuzzy.  (Get it?)
[00:55:03] <sintax> lol
[00:55:05] <sintax> oh boy
[00:56:24] <fritzwastaken> whoa, PublicWifi posted an IRL pic of himself on reddit. https://i.redd.it/4wgd2kyedac81.jpg

[00:57:19] <PattyCakes> I thought we lived where it was already 5pm
[00:57:25] <sintax> we do
[00:57:26] <PattyCakes> because I have an hour and a half, and I don't get your point
[00:57:30] <sintax> lol

[00:58:10] <PattyCakes> sockets*
[00:58:15] <PattyCakes> wow, I'm fucking old
[00:58:31] <sintax> PattyCakes: can you find the 10mm?
[00:58:31] <PattyCakes> ayy but I got some sexy new magnetic socket organizers
[00:58:43] <PattyCakes> true story, I bought a box of sockets from a pawn shop
[00:58:49] <PattyCakes> over 1000 sockets

[00:59:28] <PattyCakes> actually, joking aside, I think I got plenty of 10s
[00:59:33] <PattyCakes> it's the 14s that walk away around here
[00:59:41] <sintax> really
[00:59:48] <PattyCakes> I do a lot of construction based things
[00:59:48] <signofzeta> good luck.  my car from high school got crushed into a cube, but my 13mm socket is still in there
[00:59:49] <PattyCakes> wood things
[00:59:52] <PattyCakes> so hex head bolts

[04:44:35] <signofzeta> @yazarrrs: Postfix won't care if it's your Gmail.  It'll only care if it's an outside account.  Sadly, that's beyond my skill set.  Postfix hands email to my Dovecot server (which is on the same box).
[04:45:17] <signofzeta> @yazarrrs: Postfix won't relay to Gmail (or any domain outside $mydestinations) by default. I'm not sure how to change that, but you're in the right place to ask others.

[08:59:44] <SirSceptalot> shit you eat steak in the morning?
[08:59:49] <SirSceptalot> or pork
[08:59:51] <yuken> Pork chop. That was at 6PM.
[08:59:55] <yuken> but yes I also eat steak in the morning too.
[09:00:00] <yuken> Steak and potatoes and eggs is a common US breakfast.
[09:00:15] <SirSceptalot> huh, the more you know

[09:11:10] <SirSceptalot> Reinhilde, isn't there a standard for fan pins?
[09:12:53] <Reinhilde> not for IBM/Lenovo fan modules.
[09:13:13] <Reinhilde> This seems to be an 8-pin single plug bad boy
[09:13:34] <Reinhilde> and the plugs are smol
[09:14:47] <SirSceptalot> I've never had to mess with fans or fan modules... 8 pins?
[09:14:51] <Reinhilde> yes
[09:15:07] <Reinhilde> each module has two fans, a 5 blade and a 4 blade
[09:15:07] <SirSceptalot> so it's a controller or something? I can't imagine a single fan needing 8 pins :p
[09:16:22] <Reinhilde> I had a failed fan module apart. I think I could power up these fans by connecting them to a lead-acid
[09:17:35] <Reinhilde> 2 rows of 4 cables. I assume it could be spliced to two Noctua A4s, but then I'd still need to get a casing made up
[09:17:35] <SirSceptalot> does it have any controller boards or something? Or is it simply an 8-pin connector that splits into 2 4-pins?
[09:17:56] <Reinhilde> it's an 8 pin connector that splits to 8 wires, 4 of which go to each fan

[10:41:45] <JollyRgrs> "what's a CD" - some zennial probably
[10:41:57] <JollyRgrs> i thought 12 monkeys was a movie
[10:42:07] <Cl0udNinja> it was
[10:42:12] <Cl0udNinja> and they made a show on SyFy
[10:42:14] <SirSceptalot> yeah with bruce willis

[10:42:24] <Cl0udNinja> dont bother watching the show.. 
[10:42:53] <JollyRgrs> i won't. The movie wasn't bad, but wasn't something i'd invest in following up with a tv show
[10:43:05] <JollyRgrs> is it like... before or after or same timeline as the movie?
[10:43:10] <Cl0udNinja> idk
[10:43:19] <Cl0udNinja> heh yeah I figured I'd give it a go, and after the first season I dont understand anything going on

[10:43:40] <SirSceptalot> was he crazy or really going through time? The latter I seem to recall?

[11:25:06] <Cl0udNinja> I made it about half way into the second season before I totally gave up tryin to understand, and I totally gave up watching it half way through season 3 because I just cant follow it anymore
[11:25:57] <SirSceptalot> those descriptions remind me of Lost
[11:26:20] <Cl0udNinja> I actually understood lost, even though the ending made me want to throw my tv out the window

[11:26:56] <SirSceptalot> but after a while there were just so many things that were ignored or not explained
[11:31:06] <sloth_on_meth> https://i.imgur.com/GDEQYdR.png these drivers are somehow unsigned even though theyre from MS
[11:31:11] <sloth_on_meth> causing a BSOD in prod for us right now 
[11:32:24] <sloth_on_meth> it's a hyperV VM
[11:33:18] <xe0n> what are the drivers for, or is that just a list of rando files you've scanned for?
[11:34:13] <sloth_on_meth> this is the list of unsigned drivers it's erroring on. dont know what they are for tbh 
[11:35:03] <xe0n> you sure it's not an application causing the crash?
[11:35:04] <xe0n> or a process?
[11:35:49] <sloth_on_meth> no, this only occurs on reboot. a CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED error BSOD pops up, and it only boots when disabling driver signature enforcement, which does not persist through reboots. so we can boot it once, but as soon as the server reboots, KLABAM
[11:36:59] <xe0n> has there been any other sort of changes recently, or did it start happening out of nowhere?
[11:37:07] <xe0n> find it strange
[11:37:16] <sloth_on_meth> https://pastebin.com/mEgtVvV6 started occuring after these windows updates
[11:37:43] <CptLuxx> so.. 
[11:37:51] <CptLuxx> is this just the reboot problem with the latest patch?
[11:37:57] <CptLuxx> where already a new patch exists to fix it?

[11:39:47] <sloth_on_meth> but didnt resolve the issue

[13:01:49] <BWMerlin> I figure that with the USB-C charger in (I tried both the USB-C and Thunderbolt ports) there was some kind of time out/handshake failure

[19:53:30] <Bru^> agreed.
[19:53:50] <sintax> bdenlinger be my google machine!
[19:54:01] <Bru^> I got to where I am from the ability to research and "figure it out"
[19:54:13] <sintax> that's half of IT 
[19:54:21] <Bru^> that's most of IT
[19:54:53] <Bru^> I went to school for marketing and political science
[19:54:59] <Bru^> ended up in IT for the past 8 years :D
[19:55:19] <sintax> i was a history major...
[19:55:39] <Bru^> noice
[19:55:41] <Bru^> I love history
[19:55:44] <sintax> same
[19:55:52] <Bru^> like reading a technet article from last week
[19:55:53] <Bru^> ancient history
[19:56:03] <sintax> might as well be the 80's
[19:56:14] <Bru^> but
[19:56:24] <Bru^> somedays I want to hang it up and become a goat farmer
[19:56:39] <Bru^> definitely wouldnt trade this field for anything though
[19:56:49] <sintax> i do have fun with this field
[19:57:00] <Bru^> although if I ever opened my own non-IT business, my network would be tight AF
[19:57:02] <thegodsquirrel> Nice reference Bru^ 
[19:57:24] <Bru^> thegodsquirrel: which one? the goat farming or that technet articles from last week are considered ancient history
[19:57:24] <Bru^> ?
[19:57:28] <sintax> yeah my home network has a 10gbit backbone
[19:57:32] <thegodsquirrel> goat farming
[19:57:35] <vinrock>  all the animal videos i watch are starting to convince me i should get a small farm and load it up with unwanted livestock

[19:59:34] <thegodsquirrel> both replaced
[19:59:34] <sintax> ooh for sure
[19:59:48] <Bru^> yeah SMART alerts mean that the drive could last 5 more years, or 2 more minutes.
[19:59:52] <Bru^> 50/50
[20:00:57] <thegodsquirrel> I had a brand new Samsung SSD OS disk throw reallocated sectors count and I got a new drive and dd'd that boy

[20:01:18] <Bru^> 2016
[20:01:22] <vinrock> oh 
[20:01:26] <vinrock> yeah i would just replace it
[20:01:28] <Bru^> it was a recycle pile item at my MSP
[20:01:33] <vinrock> anything over 5 years giving me shit i assume is on its way out
[20:01:37] * DrGibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[20:01:38] <Bru^> yeah
[20:01:55] <Bru^> might go 8TB for shits if Im gonna have to buy
[20:02:01] <Bru^> gonna check for Amazon Renewed first
[20:02:01] <sintax> do it
[20:02:07] <Bru^> sometimes they have 5 year warranties on em still
[20:02:07] <sintax> 8tb easystore and shuck it
[20:02:22] <Bru^> I bought my 4x4TB WD Golds from renewed for $75/each and came with 5 year warranty
[20:02:25] <Bru^> was a steal
[20:02:25] <thegodsquirrel> check shuck.stop first
[20:02:37] <sintax> ^^
[20:02:40] <sintax> great website
[20:02:45] <Bru^> thanks for the tip!
[20:02:50] <Bru^> newegg has gone to shit IMO
[20:02:53] <Bru^> interface wise

[20:03:00] <thegodsquirrel> https://diskprices.com/
[20:03:05] <vinrock> they always have been
[20:03:13] <vinrock> "new egg" is a chinese thing
[20:03:14] <thegodsquirrel> This is a great site and they have an IRC channel
[20:03:20] <Bru^> newegg used to be better
[20:03:25] <sintax> shuck.stop has an irc?
[20:03:29] <Bru^> i always filter with Sold at New Egg
[20:03:34] <vinrock> i have a newegg warehouse a mile up the road from me, i used to order shit all the time and pick it up same day
[20:03:35] <vinrock> it was awesome
[20:03:38] <thegodsquirrel> no the other one I posted sintax 
[20:03:39] <sintax> also if you get the drive at best buy see if you can turn the old drive in for another 15% off
[20:03:40] <Bru^> oh nice!!
[20:03:42] <vinrock> then they stopped that and ive never purchased form them since
[20:03:46] <sintax> thegodsquirrel: got ya
[20:03:52] <sintax> have to remember that
[20:04:09] <Bru^> seagate EXOS 6TB drive for $90
[20:04:16] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> yea vinrock I used to go to the cables 2 go warehouse for will calls. Super nice but someone the person was always confused
[20:04:17] <Bru^> 256MB cache
[20:04:29] <Bru^> not bad
[20:04:35] <Bru^> anyone use Exos drives before?
[20:04:43] <Bru^> ive never been a barracuda fan
[20:04:53] <technonerd> i almost went with exos for my nas
[20:05:00] <Bru^> why didnt you?
[20:05:04] <sintax> i think they're alright
[20:05:07] <technonerd> noise
[20:05:08] <A-KO> morning
[20:05:11] <vinrock> ive stuck with wd for spinny drives and samsung for ssd's for a long time now
[20:05:15] <Bru^> man the price jump between 6TB and 8TB is substantial
[20:05:22] <technonerd> and more monnnie
[20:05:23] <Bru^> yeah WDs have never done me dirty
[20:05:41] <Bru^> ive got 12 year old WD Enterprise drives still spinning at home
[20:05:47] <vinrock> i've refused to buy seagate for almost 20 years now but i hear theyre better so im willing to give them a chance now
[20:05:58] <thegodsquirrel> I am slowly swapping out my JBOD, I shucked a My Book the other day
[20:05:58] <Bru^> weve used ironwolf at work and theyve done okay
[20:06:06] <Bru^> if only used the barracudas and they were unreliable
[20:06:15] <vinrock> i did just buy 12 of the new Synology HAT drives that are rebranded Toshiba enterprise drives, curious how these are gonna last
[20:06:25] <Bru^> ehh i wont touch toshibas 
[20:06:29] <Bru^> personally
[20:06:34] <vinrock> ive heard these enterprise models are rock solid
[20:06:35] <Bru^> not sure about their enterprise
[20:06:37] <thegodsquirrel> also check out Backblaze's quarterly report, it has good info
[20:06:43] <Bru^> but I have a bad taste from their desktop drives
[20:06:54] <Bru^> i could spend the $ and get WD golds

[20:08:24] <vinrock> ok the Syno drives are rebranded Toshiba MG
[20:08:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> With a drive that large it's basically malpractice to use them in a raid5
[20:08:45] <Bru^> man I really did get a steal when I bought these 4TB Golds
[20:08:59] <Bru^> $75/each with warranty
[20:09:01] <vinrock> i stopped using anything but raid 10 when hdds started getting gigundo
[20:09:03] <Bru^> theyre going for $150+ now
[20:09:09] <vinrock> damn nice
[20:09:14] <Bru^> vinrock: im using unraid
[20:09:16] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> sure wish I had the cash to blow on a raid 10
[20:09:18] <sintax> JBOD baby
[20:09:25] <thegodsquirrel> I think new egg had an 18 TB ultrastar for $379 the last I looked
[20:09:27] <vinrock> i havent spent any time looking at unraid, i should
[20:09:29] <Bru^> honestly might do 4TB drives with dual parity
[20:09:51] <Bru^> im out of physical drive space in my server though
[20:09:57] <Bru^> unless i get some 2.5" drives
[20:10:25] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> JBOD and let ZFS or something handle the parity
[20:10:39] <thegodsquirrel> 2.5 is expensive for larger sizes, I just got these cool SATA extender cabled and run 3.5a
[20:10:44] <Bru^> i had to buy a 5.25" bay adapter which ill house 1x3.5" and 2x2.5"
[20:11:18] <technonerd> i paid 515 each for 16tb ironwolfs
[20:11:28] <Bru^> thegodsquirrel: definitely is
[20:11:44] <vinrock> i thnk i just paid $320/ea for mine in 8tb
[20:11:48] <Bru^> tbh Im not even close to needing more space
[20:11:56] <Bru^> so ill cross that bridge when I get to it
[20:11:57] <thegodsquirrel> The cables look janky but I don't care for homeprod
[20:12:07] <Bru^> 16TB of data + 6TB parity drive will be plenty for now

[21:14:14] <mikespears> I've had no issues with amazon

[21:14:39] <vinrock> yup sure as shit, the order i plaed on Monday with Amaozn hasnt even shiped yet and its supposedly in stock in their warehouse
[21:14:40] <mikespears> a few people have said that, but I've been lucky as fuck so far
[21:14:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and the refund was the easiest ive ever had with online shopping
[21:15:15] <PattyCakes> My account averages 5-10 orders a day - at that rate it's almost guaranteed at least one order wont show up when expected
[21:15:28] <PattyCakes> last issue I ran into, ordered some metal setup blocks for the wood router
[21:15:35] <mikespears> couple thousand in APs, had in 24 hours, 1k in SSDs, had in under 24 hours
[21:15:39] <PattyCakes> they shipped it in a bag, metal + plastic bag == missing pieces
[21:15:44] <PattyCakes> called, got a label to send back
[21:15:52] <vinrock> i spend maybe a quarter mil a year with amazon
[21:15:53] <PattyCakes> sent it back, got dingged for "item not fully returned"
[21:15:56] <vinrock> they been fckin up lately
[21:15:59] <PattyCakes> like I Fucking told you guys it was missing pieces
[21:16:03] <PattyCakes> THAT'S WHY I RETURNED IT
[21:16:30] <PattyCakes> they fixed it after I spent an hour working with them, but still god damn
[21:16:44] <PattyCakes> that's probably on par with what runs through my account vinrock 
[21:16:53] <PattyCakes> it's a quasi company / my entire family account
[21:17:36] <vinrock> ugh i cancelled the order with amazon and have to place it with provantage now
[21:17:40] <vinrock> i said id never use provantage again
[21:17:57] <vinrock> ive caught those mfers changing the price of shit in my shopping art, while i was going through checkout
[21:18:08] <PattyCakes> like, I'd be ok if they just were like "yea, we ain't gettin there here on time"
[21:18:14] <vinrock> ikr?
[21:18:16] <vinrock> just fuckin tell me
[21:18:17] <PattyCakes> but once it enters that "delayed" status
[21:18:17] <PattyCakes> GOOD
[21:18:18] <PattyCakes> FUCK
[21:18:19] <PattyCakes> IN
[21:18:19] <PattyCakes> LUCK
[21:18:41] <PattyCakes> Once you hit delayed, it'll show up eventually. No way to track it, no ETA, no location updates
[21:18:51] <PattyCakes> nahhhh, it'll just be on your door one random tuessday morning
[21:18:56] <PattyCakes> days, weeks, months, years after you ordered it
[21:20:16] <PattyCakes> I've finally totally stopped ording anything tool related on Amazon too. Way too many headaches
[21:21:40] <PattyCakes> I'd say there's a solid 80% fuck up rate when it comes to power tools from Amazon, and yes I'm talking only first party shipped/sold by amazon. I've had over a dozen counterfeit tools, batteries, and accessories make it through. I've had manufacturers deny warranty work because even though I bought it through Amazon, I didn't buy it through the authorized Amazon "store"
[21:24:46] <vinrock> oh power tools have been a shit show lately, especially early on during the pandemic you couldnt get shit
[21:25:02] <vinrock> the new milwaukee range that came out it was nearly impossible to get any of the impact drivers or drills
[21:25:13] <PattyCakes> I finally got mine on ebay
[21:25:16] <PattyCakes> where the seller got them, idk
[21:25:19] <PattyCakes> I'm sure a truck was involved
[21:25:22] <PattyCakes> and probably gravity
[21:25:36] <vinrock> i noticed home depot was getting some at random intervals but they were selling as fast as they came in
[21:25:51] <Bru^> lol
[21:25:55] <PattyCakes> I managed to only pay retail for the oens I got early in the pandemic
[21:25:59] <Bru^> PattyCakes: I picture a F&F style heist
[21:25:59] <vinrock> damn nice
[21:26:06] <Bru^> honda civics with fart cans
[21:26:07] <PattyCakes> but yea, a ton of folks buying at HD and reselling on ebay
[21:26:23] <PattyCakes> still a problem honestly
[21:26:34] <PattyCakes> batteries are INSANE, especially the dewalt 20v stuff
[21:26:34] <Bru^> ill stick with my trusty dewalts
[21:26:43] <PattyCakes> insane as in HD sells the 5ah for like $99
[21:26:52] <PattyCakes> ebay? $199
[21:27:06] <vinrock> yeah the battery prices are nuts
[21:27:14] <vinrock> the new 12AH battery packs arent those like 300buckeroos
[21:27:17] <PattyCakes> maybe not that absurd anymore, but over christmas, the deals I got at local brick an mortor could be doubled on ebay
[21:27:47] <PattyCakes> I added 3 5ah packs, 2 4ah, and grabbed one of the ehhhhh I think it's a 12ah 60/20v flex
[21:27:53] <PattyCakes> spent under $500
[21:28:25] <vinrock> dayum
[21:28:38] <PattyCakes> granted, I cheated. I did buy combo kits with the tools
[21:28:41] <PattyCakes> and got rid of the tools
