[00:09:41] <blkshp> Personally, I don't. You'll have to ask a learner, there's probably a few about :D

[00:23:43] <Sqaure> slidercrank, oh thanks
[00:23:49] <alexsms> Sqaure, podcasts and video on youtube with subs really help these days
[00:24:40] <alexsms> listening to audio when you walk is nice too
[00:24:44] <hans> >then realized the beer in the garage was skunked
[00:24:47] <hans> skunked? 
[00:24:50] <Sqaure> alexsms, isnt software a thing? I'd feel word quizes would be a fun past time
[00:25:34] <alexsms> software imo doesn help much, it's more technical than real life thing
[00:26:10] <alexsms> one needs to hear real people and real language, i think listening is more important than reading
[00:26:20] <slidercrank> Sqaure, just try different methods and see what works for you! textbooks, Russian speaking clubs, movies with subs, podcasts, chats on the Internet, applications, etc
[00:26:43] <alexsms> depends on what your goals are of course, I am more about comprehending real talk
[00:27:21] <Sqaure> cyrillic keyboard will be a challenge 
[00:27:24] <alexsms> for written language, anything is fine
[00:28:04] <hans> i got the defition of the "skunked": If beer gets hot-cold-hot-cold it affects the flavor in a very negative way. We call it getting skunked where im at.

[08:16:27] <Me-me> I know. I wanted to see if anyone would lie.
[08:16:44] <twb> I think the author was trying to refer to Welsh
[08:17:11] <twb> oh sorry, I thought this was #emacs still.  "rolling r's and l's" came up there earlier
[08:17:18] <Me-me> Oh okay.
[08:17:21] <Me-me> What a coincidence.
[08:17:34] <Maxdamantus> I can think of a sound that could be described as a rolled "l", but I'm not sure it's used in any languages.
[08:17:38] <LjL> okay, to be fair,
[08:17:39] <LjL> Lateral trills are also possible. They may be pronounced by initiating [ɬ] or [ɮ] with an especially forceful airflow. There is no symbol for them in the IPA. Lateral coronal trills are sometimes used to imitate bird calls, and are a component of Donald Duck talk.[citation needed] A labiodental trill, [ʙ̪], is most likely to be lateral, but laterality is not distinctive among labial sounds.[citation needed]

[13:04:22] <Maxdamantus> Dunno what your source is though.
[13:04:34] <Maxdamantus> > weather affects plants, plants use minerals in the soil, and are food for animals, animals spread plants seeds, plants secure the soil, and plants evaporate water, which affects weather
[13:05:22] <Maxdamantus> should probably be "plants' seeds" or "plant seeds", rather than "plants seeds", but the version I quoted at least sounds sensible.
