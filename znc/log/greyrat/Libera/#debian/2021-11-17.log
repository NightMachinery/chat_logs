[05:27:38] <somiaj> yea wishlist bugs are the common method, in general the BTS is used to communicate to the maintainer, track issues, etc.
[05:30:17] <themill> a reason why it would be good to upgrade (other than 'shiny') is helpful too; if there are known compatibilities/incompatibilities with other packages, that's helpful to mention
[05:33:03] <themill> (if you asked me to upgrade qt5reactor, for instance, I'd say "no" as the only changes past the current version are windows-specific; if you asked me to upgrade opendrop, I'd say "no" as it can't be built in debian right now; if you asked to upgrade malai I'd say "no" as it breaks latexdraw...)

[11:26:13] <jelly> there might be other things you need to explicitely run to have a functional X session these days, but I don't know which ones.  I use sddm or lightdm,
[11:26:17] <jelly> .
[11:26:42] <pingpongball> i was also thinking like tap to click works on gnome,
[11:26:43] <pingpongball> but
[11:26:43] <pingpongball> How to make tap to click in bspwm?
[11:27:12] <pingpongball> i mean this is very easy to find if i google, but most answers are outdated,
[11:27:22] <jelly> that sounds like an xinput problem
[11:28:23] <pingpongball> pressing xinput i dont found touchpad options
[11:28:31] <pingpongball> for touchpad like there is ImPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse.

[14:51:02] <Fjorgynn> ok

[14:52:29] <rendar> PerfDave, the thing is zfs, btw
[14:53:38] <rendar> what will happen if i install linux-headers-$(uname -r), then in the future zfs will try to update and the linux kernel will be a greater version? besides i remove or i don't remove that linux-headers-$(uname -r) package.. wouldn't that brings inconsistencies in the system?
[14:55:14] <PerfDave> rendar: I expect dkms will just fail to build the ZFS modules if it doesn't have the right headers. Which is probably fine unless your root fs is on ZFS

[14:57:39] <towo-home> exact
[14:58:06] <PerfDave> rendar: I'm not *advising* that because I haven't tried it, haven't read whatever website it is you're looking at etc. But it's probably sensible.

[15:03:58] <rendar> PerfDave, ok i see, there is a way to get "amd64" from uname?
[15:04:20] <f-a> what is the purpose of tor randall ?
[15:06:02] <PerfDave> f-a: https://www.torproject.org/ can tell you that. Tor Browser is designed as a single Firefox-based browser that's simple to use. You can in principle get any application to proxy over Tor, including other browsers, but in practice it is very very difficult to get right.
[15:06:18] <randall> f-a: To disguise network traffic and make it difficult to get fingerprinted/identified.
[15:06:20] <PerfDave> So unless you're some kind of networking expert with too much time on your hands, just use Tor Browser ;)

[15:11:28] <jelly> rendar: there is no package named just linux-headers'
[15:11:40] <rendar> ok
[15:12:28] <PerfDave> rendar: The zfs-dkms package depends on dkms which depends on linux-headers-amd64 (on my amd64 system), so I don't see why you're messing with this by hand
[15:12:29] <jelly> to make dkms work, you need matching headers for the kernel that is running, and the kernel you're going to boot into next time.  It's your call how you're going to achieve that.
[15:13:11] <jelly> if you have linux-image-amd64 installed, linux-headers-amd64 will always match that
[15:13:48] <rendar> PerfDave, ok, in the website they say i should install linux-image-amd64 and linux-headers-$( uname -r ) hence i'm here asking
[15:13:56] <jelly> if you have some other kernel package installed separately that wasn't automatically pulled in by linux-image-amd64, you'll have to match its uname -r
[15:13:57] <rendar> jelly, ok
[15:14:15] <jelly> rendar: it helps if you understand WHY they say that
[15:14:28] <rendar> i'm getting that thanks to your help
[15:15:15] * Khepra hears zfs, perks up....
[15:15:25] <jelly> maybe you're going to pick some specific kernel version and flavor in the future, we don't know.  You'd want to match its uname -r then.

[15:16:27] <jelly> however if you stick to one debian release, no backports, one build flavor (-amd64), installing linux-image-amd64 and linux-headers-amd64 will make sure you always have the latest for that release, and that they match

[15:57:08] <matik> Hmm, on my system /tmp and /var/tmp are not tmpfs mounted. In fact it looks like /var/tmp is not even cleaned on boot. The default config of systemd-tmpfiles in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf has /var/tmp comemnted out . Shouldn't these dirs be tmpfs or at least cleaned on reboot by default? Or maybe It's just my system that is misconfigured somehow ?

[19:28:15] <PerfDave> It seems to me rendar that you are flailing around a little. Perhaps you need to run fewer commands and think more about the ones you're running.
[19:28:36] <Brigo> PerfDave, where is the fun in that? :-D
[19:28:36] <rendar> PerfDave, question: zfs-dkms should install any linux-headers* package?! (y/n)

[19:29:29] <rendar> randall, ok, wait
[19:29:31] <PerfDave> zfs-dkms depends on dkms. dkms depends on linux-headers* packages
[19:29:45] <Brigo> rendar, i have checked the package description and there is no such dependency
[19:29:51] <rendar> PerfDave, exactly, *STILL* i don't have any linux-headers* package installed

[19:32:23] <Brigo> rendar, they are not a dependency but a recomendation.
[19:32:27] <rendar> Brigo, oh, ok
[19:32:31] <rendar> then PerfDave was wrong, ok
[19:32:39] <Brigo> PerfDave, you should have install recomended as default.
[19:33:34] <rendar> Brigo, now the question was that website guide tells me to install linux-headers-$(uname -r) but then i was worried what will happen when a new kernel version is updated, and zfs will update too if i install a *precise* version of linux headers?
[19:33:34] <randall> rendar: Then just install linux-headers-amd64, like you've been told earlier today.
[19:33:47] <rendar> ok, fine
[19:33:47] <Brigo> PerfDave, install recomended is the default behaviour for apt

[19:34:34] <randall> rendar: Yes, you should have that installed, too. Assuming you want to use the stock Debian kernels.

[19:46:00] <PerfDave> rendar: It's far less restrictive than the license that nVidia's proprietary code uses

[23:38:03] <tesseract> so you need to install it

[23:46:09] <yang> but uses lots of CPU
[23:47:01] <somiaj> grolongo: yes, but you are using the firmware installer, so the firmware for most devices are there. I was just saying that sometimes you get a 'missing firmware' message, and this doesn't matter, because other firmware is found that works
[23:47:27] <somiaj> some devices the firmware cannot be distributed by debian, so you do have to download it yourself (often using a tool in contrib to automate this)

[23:49:06] <grolongo> it tells me the "missing firmware files are: iwlwifi-6000g2a-6.ucode and iwlwifi-6000g2a-5.ucode"
[23:50:03] <yang> grolongo: insstall package "firmware-iwlwifi"
[23:50:14] <somiaj> that is strange, that firmware should be included in the firmware installer.
[23:50:40] <grolongo> yes, these files can be found in firmware-iwlwifi.deb, which is included in the nonfree netinstall
[23:50:43] <somiaj> If you aren't using the firmware installer, then as yang mentioned, you can install the non-free package to get them.

[23:51:30] <grolongo> somiaj: I'm using the firmware installer, that's why it's odd to me that it is mentioning this and not installing automatically.
[23:53:05] <somiaj> grolongo: yea, I'm not sure why it isn't finding them. The netinstall does contain a base system that can be installed without internet. I often will just install the base system, then debug the issue afterwards
[23:53:54] <yang> grolongo: maybe the netinstall only has "main" free drivers and that firmware is in the "non-free" section
[23:54:59] <grolongo> I even did a find . -iname *firmware-iwlwifi* and found it
