[00:23:48] <TXDillo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weinberg
[00:23:48] <Janet> ^ Max Weinberg is an American drummer and television personality, most widely known as the longtime drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and as the bandleader for Conan O'Brien on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight...
[00:24:02] <TXDillo> "Weinberg also suffered from repetitive stress injury and tendinitis, eventually requiring seven operations on his hands and wrists"
[00:24:39] <TXDillo> "The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on."
[00:25:07] <TXDillo> I'd say you're both wrong about that

[06:43:39] <sdragon> Contemporary Christian Music
[06:44:25] <sdragon> It's the stuff that's played in like megachurches and such
[06:50:55] <sdragon> I found a patch called Edge, which is a U2 tone, and just kinda went, "oh. I can turn this into something I hate."
[06:51:00] <sdragon> And so I did
[06:51:51] <efex> oohh the televison “prospority theology” brand then

[06:53:38] <sdragon> With the weak lyrics about how "I call out your name and it saves me" or some shit like that, but never actually says the name "Jesus"

[06:58:17] <efex> Spirtuality does not require a human organized religious group
[06:59:03] <efex> I do see how organized groups of any type at all would have been an asset to developing civilization
[07:01:05] <sdragon> I prefer disorganized religious groups, personally
[07:01:36] <efex> I prefer spiritualty, whihc exists without groups, myself
[07:02:25] <sdragon> I don't have a problem with groups
[07:02:36] <sdragon> Relationships and community are important
[07:02:58] <efex> fine
[07:03:15] <efex> I think that is all peripheral
[07:04:04] <efex> social groups are fine but I prefer them not to me held togther by magical group thinking
[07:04:30] <sdragon> I'm a pluralist, so I don't buy into any sort of One True Way
[07:04:43] <efex> one personal can have a relationship with god, if god exists
[07:05:08] <efex> my idea has nothing to do with groups “one true way"
[07:05:51] <efex> any individual can be with god, if god exists. 
[07:05:57] <efex> great!
[07:06:15] <sdragon> I do like the concept of what Christians would call "praying in the closet"
[07:06:29] <efex> Human social groups with a topic are someting else.
[07:06:43] <efex> not head of that
[07:06:52] *** joel1 is now known as kanye_west
[07:07:07] <efex> sounds self-explanatory tho
[07:07:17] *** kanye_west is now known as joel1
[07:07:37] <sdragon> There's a passage in the Bible where Jesus tells people to pray in the closet, not in the street
[07:07:45] <efex> I dont see prayer as a useful thing, as why would an all powerful care about grovelling?
[07:08:20] <sdragon> Basically saying, worship, but don't turn your worship into some public display
[07:08:49] <efex> but.. living life in ways that benefit the universe would be of assistance, and so closer to an association with god (if god exists)
[07:08:59] <sdragon> ^^^^
[07:09:02] <sdragon> Yes
[07:09:24] <circuitbone> externalised forces are easier to dismiss delusions
[07:12:30] <sdragon> circuitbone: I dunno, man. I've yet to meet anyone who would sincerely dismiss the sun as a delusion
[07:13:14] <circuitbone> It means when you externalise that there is an omni potent being or force you can cast away things like murder or stealing etc to another false diety.
[07:13:28] <circuitbone> A slippery slope of delusion.

[22:18:25] <DOMF> it's a lot
[22:18:43] <murthy> Nice
[22:18:50] <louipcD> how many strings
[22:18:58] <DOMF> I've been auditioning for a punk band, and working on new shit w/ my blues rock band
[22:19:20] <DOMF> <louipcD> how many strings <-- just 6, but I've never played on more than 4 so I'm having to re-learn all the scales and shit
[22:19:27] <murthy> DOMF: nice
[22:19:40] <DOMF> I like how the tuning is all in 4ths as opposed to the random 5th thrown in on a guitar 
[22:19:48] <murthy> DOMF: your's is a blue rock?
[22:20:01] <DOMF> that's a different band. I haven't posted any of it
[22:20:16] <efex> circuitbone:  I will quit the discussion, fine. I expressed a certain idea that also has concern for others as the motivation, and that’s enough for music!
[22:20:18] <murthy> Oh that's why. Nice
[22:20:24] <DOMF> (mainly because my guitarist is hella paranoid and doesn't want anything out there until the album is released)
