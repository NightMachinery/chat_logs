[03:32:25] <programmerq> kittonian: that is indeed correct. Docker's port publishing system gets handled before the INPUT chain does. You'll want to avoid having docker publish on a port that you need to use elsewhere. Normally, docker will error out if the port is already in use, but if docker is started before the other service I do believe that you can run into a situation like you describe. The DOCKER-USER chain is
[03:32:28] <programmerq> indeed supposed to be a place for user-defined rules to take precedence over what docker puts in place, but without additional details about what your firewall looks like all anyone can offer is guesses.
[03:33:05] <kittonian> right
[03:33:16] <kittonian> and all my open ports are in the docker-user chain but they are not working
[03:33:27] <kittonian> they were working just fine before the reboot so something got messed up
[03:33:36] <kittonian> and that's what I don't know how to resolve
[03:33:41] <kittonian> been looking at tons of docs to no avail
[03:34:24] <kittonian> the only way I can now open a port that isn't already opened via docker is to manually add an accept line to the top of the input chain, which I should not have to do
[03:34:45] <programmerq> again, without you showing more about what your firewall looks like, all anyone can offer is guesses.
[03:34:51] <kittonian> so something isn't working in the forward chain which has the docker-user jump as the first entry as it should
[03:34:59] <kittonian> happy to pastebin whatever you need to assist
[03:35:06] <kittonian> tell me what you want to see and I'll do it
[03:35:32] <kittonian> i pastebin'd three chains if you want to start there https://bpa.st/3KBA
[03:36:22] <kittonian> this first accept line of the input chain is the one I had to put in for ssh to work

[03:42:29] <programmerq> and is this 28666 running as a docker container? or as a non-dockerized service on the host?
[03:42:40] <kittonian> that's just ssh on the host
[03:44:54] <programmerq> you have a f2b-fail2ban target that isn't included in your paste. The FORWARD chain and the accompanying DOCKER-USER chain doesn't really mess with stuff on the INPUT chain. I would expect you don't need the DOCKER-USER chain's port 28666 ACCPET rule at all if you just have a service running on port 28666 on the host.
[03:45:09] <programmerq> I'd be more interested in what that f2b chain looks like for stuff that is expected to be processed by the INPUT chain.
[03:45:58] <programmerq> in fact, in nearly every docker host that I deal with, my DOCKER-USER chain is untouched.
[03:46:06] <programmerq> it just has the default RETURN rule and that's that.
[03:46:26] <programmerq> it's really more helpful for when you want to do things like limit what hosts can access a published port on a docker container
[03:48:12] <kittonian> this is a web/mail/etc server
[03:48:18] <kittonian> everyone needs access from the outside world
[03:48:28] <kittonian> that's why I have specific ports specified in the docker-user chain
[03:48:32] <kittonian> everything else is blocked
[03:48:48] <kittonian> f2b is fail2ban running on the host
[03:48:59] <programmerq> I am aware of what fail2ban is
[03:49:06] <programmerq> but you didn't include the chain
[03:49:14] <kittonian> there are thousands of entries
[03:49:42] <programmerq> those will be 100% relevant to seeing why putting that explicit allow above the f2b rule in the INPUT chain has the effect that it has.
[03:50:04] <kittonian> you want me to pastebin my entire f2b chain?
[03:50:20] <programmerq> if you want me to help you figure out what your firewall is doing instead of guessing, then yes.
[03:50:24] <programmerq> otherwise all I can offer is a guess
[03:50:35] <kittonian> ok, give me a sec
[03:50:42] <programmerq> but the DOCKER-USER stuff only comes into play for FORWARD stuff, and you got your desired behavior by changing the INPUT chain
[03:50:56] <programmerq> so it isn't a docker-user thing at all, it's out on the INPUT chain that is blocking your traffic.
[03:51:09] <kittonian> ok
[03:51:24] <programmerq> my guess is that you may have locked yourself out of the system via fail2ban
[03:51:35] <programmerq> I've done that once or twice myself. :)

[23:31:24] <programmerq> XATRIX: I ran into that type of issue years ago when I was running a bunch of compiles, but I was scaling out with distcc across several hosts. It turned into my "cluster" being idle while a long running ./configure would run and then the cluster would compile everything super fast and then move on to the next package and had to wait for the ./configure again
[23:31:27] <programmerq> lol
[23:31:47] <programmerq> I never really got a good solution. Maybe you could work in a ramdisk to speed things up that might be io-bound like that?
[23:31:57] <ikke> there is not that much you can do about it
[23:32:16] <programmerq> apt is mostly io, configure is just lots of little programs that run. faster io can help both those cases.
[23:32:35] <programmerq> but if you do have a single threaded bottleneck somewhere, there's not a ton you can do, unfortunately.
[23:32:54] <XATRIX> programmerq: yea, i made gcc to use 32 core by MAKEOPTS=-j$(nproc) , so, i don't currently look on a cluster compile. Yea, i tried distcc

[23:35:46] <programmerq> XATRIX: whether you are using virtualization or not, if you have a single threaded bottleneck, that's kind of that. If the physical CPU is pegged at one core by whatever the one thread is doing, then you're kind of stuck with that single threaded bottleneck.
[23:36:17] <XATRIX> got it :(
[23:36:38] <programmerq> yarn install is likely one of those IO and/or single threaded bottleneck processes. I see you are using the RUN --mount cache stuff, which is indeed helpful.
