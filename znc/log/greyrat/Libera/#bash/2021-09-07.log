[00:40:11] <FreeBDSM> I'm reading an article about what you all hate here: https://www.docker.com/blog/introduction-to-heredocs-in-dockerfiles/ there's a code block at the bottom which uses 2 heredocs to produce file with heredoc'ed contents and puts those files into a dir. I've tried to do similarly in bash and that failed. How to nest heredoc properly? https://paste.sh/7DhOGV6S#Ich0LRAuOGZZZIxqJcirqaIr here's the problem
[00:42:34] <FreeBDSM> err, why nest? just use sequentially. What I really mean is that - can I somehow group 2 heredocs with 1 use of cat?

[02:18:00] <geirha> !august
[02:18:00] <greybot> August is the month when all your scripts break because you placed $(date +%m) in a variable and tried to do arithmetic with it, without removing the leading zeros. 08 is considered octal. Use $((10#$month)) to force decimal, or strip the zero.
[02:18:40] <geirha> $(( 1630951031 + 6 * 10#$i ))

[08:03:16] <e36freak> and check the value of it in .bashrc
[08:05:28] <divide0[m]> What's typically in a .bash_profile btw? 
[08:05:48] <divide0[m]> just machine init stuff?
[08:06:33] <divide0[m]> like console setup and such, or?
[08:08:22] <e36freak> !dotfiles
[08:08:22] <greybot> Set up your environment (PATH, LANG, EDITOR, ...) in ~/.bash_profile. Set up your bash shell (PS1, functions, shopts, ...) in ~/.bashrc. Then source .bashrc from .bash_profile. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>. For GUI logins, SEE YOUR DOCUMENTATION or ask your OS channel because they're all different and we don't know.
[08:10:34] <e36freak> by the way, judging what you were trying to do, the first || in your condition would be an && if l did actually show up in $-
[08:10:37] <e36freak> !demorgan
[08:10:37] <greybot> [[ $var != a || $var != b ]] is always true. Did you forget De Morgan's Laws? [[ ! ($var = a || $var = b) ]] <=> [[ $var != a && $var != b ]]

[08:11:43] <e36freak> i still shows up in login shells though
[08:13:25] <NRK[m]> what's a more efficient way to store a cache? as plain text file (1.4mb) or as a tarball (260kb) and untar it everytime
[08:13:40] <NRK[m]> everytime it's needed*
[08:14:22] <e36freak> i guess it depends on how you define efficient
[08:14:39] <e36freak> space? cycles? how often is it used?
[08:15:56] <divide0[m]> <e36freak> "by the way, judging what you..." <- I must not have explained correctly, I would like to enter that block when its either a login or an interactive-shell-without-command. I/C work fine though. I was just wrong about the option for logins. 
[08:16:25] <e36freak> like isaid, flag variable
[08:16:26] <divide0[m]> s/-/ or /
[08:17:46] <divide0[m]> lol, its tough  to type.

[08:23:04] <NRK[m]> as in what would be faster to read
[08:26:38] <e36freak> not really a bash question, but why don't you test it?

[18:57:37] <Soliton> but again an env variable cannot be an array.
[18:58:17] <Soliton> the only way is to encode the arguments in the variable and then use eval or similar...
[18:58:28] <Soliton> !eval
[18:58:28] <greybot> 'eval' is a common misspelling of 'evil'. If eval is the answer, surely you are asking the wrong question. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/048

[19:09:30] <Guest1> Basically the script used to invoke a build command as following `build "$OPTION_1" "$OPTION_2" $OPTION3`
[19:09:57] <greycat> a) Why is OPTION3 not quoted?  b) Where do these variables come from?

[19:10:04] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/050 -- I'm trying to put a command in a variable, but the complex cases always fail!
[19:10:11] <Soliton> it's about env variables.
[19:10:19] <Soliton> well it started with just one.
[19:10:22] <Guest1> $OPTION3 is where I'm passing in my array as a string now as "${OPTION3[*]}" to get it to treat it as a single string
[19:10:23] <greycat> I'm guessing that, but it would be nice to have it confirmed.
[19:10:37] <Soliton> Guest1: again an env variable is NOT an array.
[19:10:38] <greycat> What do you mean, "passing in my array"?
[19:10:46] <Guest1> I don't know why OPTION3 wasn't quoted before, not my script.  
[19:11:05] <Soliton> because the design was abusing wordsplitting to get multiple arguments.
[19:11:05] <greycat> Where do these variables come from?
[19:11:24] <Soliton> (out of a single env variable.)
[19:11:30] <Guest1> greycat: Environment variable for OPTION3 
[19:11:50] <greycat> An environment variable is a string.  You can't pass an array that way, unless you serialize it into a string and then write code to parse it back out.
[19:12:10] <Guest1> Soliton: so you're saying that OPTION_1 and OPTION_2 work as expected because there aren't any spaces in those to begin with, so it doesn't try to put single quotes around them?
[19:12:13] <greycat> And it's a "C string", too, so you can't put NUL bytes in it.
[19:12:16] <Soliton> you don't even want your arguments to be a single string so "${array[*]}" is nonsense either way.
[19:12:44] <Soliton> Guest1: the first two are properly quoted. they work no matter what is in them.
[19:12:54] <greycat> Again with the single quotes.  Are you misinterpreting "set -x" output?
[19:13:02] <ormaaj2> Shame. Original author deserves the beat down.
[19:13:13] <greycat> # FOO="has space" bash -xc 'echo "$FOO"'
[19:13:14] <shbot> greycat: + echo 'has space'
[19:13:15] <shbot> greycat: has space
[19:13:26] <greycat> Is that where you see "single quotes"?
[19:14:13] <Guest1> Ok here's the specifics.  @greycat I might be misinterpreting "set -x" output, not sure.
[19:14:29] <Guest1> build -v -p -a X64 -b DEBUG -t GCC5 '-D BOD -D EXPECTEDHASH={0x65,0x3C,0x21,0x7D,0x21,0x5B,0x2B,0x99,0x5E,0xD2,0x0E,0x93,0x75,0x01,0x86,0xD4,0xD8,0xFE,0x8A,0x61,0xF3,0xAB,0xB0,0x95,0xA4,0x86,0x97,0x85,0xAA,0xE5,0xF2,0x75,0xBB,0xE0,0x3C,0x30,0x48,0x8B,0xAF,0x02,0xF5,0x0C,0x72,0xD4,0x95,0xD2,0x32,0xB3}'
[19:14:50] <Guest1> Those DEBUG, GCC5 are both OPTION1 and OPTION2 quoted as described above
[19:15:06] <Guest1> OPTION3, when quoted the same way, results in that single quote around the entire thing
[19:15:06] <greycat> so that's your OUTPUT, not your input?
[19:15:08] <Soliton> so you added quotes around $OPTION3?
[19:15:36] <Soliton> i guess so because you did "${OPTION3[*]}".
[19:15:48] <greycat> that doesn't add apostrophes, though
[19:15:56] <Soliton> so that breaks the design of abusing word splitting..

[19:16:26] <Guest1> That output is from me changing `build "$OPTION1" "$OPTION2" $OPTION3` into `build "$OPTION1" "$OPTION2" "$OPTION3"`
[19:16:27] <Soliton> in your case i'm not even sure why wordsplitting doesn't work for you. i see no argument with spaces.
[19:16:34] <greycat> If you are receiving a LIST of words in a single environment variable, then you need to perform splitting (parsing) on it to separate it into its component words.
[19:17:06] <Guest1> OPTION3 includes `-D BOD EXPECTEDHASH=XXXXXXXX`
[19:17:10] <Guest1> so there are spaces in it
[19:17:28] <greycat> I think some implementations of sh will perform brace expansion on the unquoted $OPTION3 because it contains {0xaa,0xbb} in it.
[19:17:56] <greycat> But it sounds like Guest1 is using bash, not OpenBSD sh, so ... I still don't get the whole picture here.
[19:18:23] <Guest1> yes, it's bash

[19:36:08] <Guest1> Sure, great - glad it's all in my head.. 
[19:36:34] <Soliton> maybe you should express what is in your head.
[19:36:36] <Guest1> Can you help me understand why $OPTION1 and $OPTION2 don't have the single quotes around them?
[19:36:39] <greycat> set -x doesn't show you just the literal contents of arguments.  it tries to quote them in a way that would allow you to paste them into a shell.
[19:36:50] <Soliton> so far you just claimed you have arguments with whitespace which is not true.
[19:37:28] <Guest1> $OPTION3 is set as "-D ARG1 -D EXPECTEDHASH={XX,XX,XX,XX}"
[19:37:29] <greycat> bash's set -x quotes {foo,bar} because you don't want the brace expansion to opccur
[19:37:31] <Guest1> so it has spaces in it.. 
[19:38:00] <Soliton> again those are 4 arguments...
[19:38:15] <Soliton> you do NOT want that to be one argument.
[19:38:34] <Soliton> and you're lucky that in this case wordsplitting does the right thing.
[19:38:56] <Soliton> if there is an actual issue somewhere you need to name it.
[19:39:34] <Guest1> Ok, I think we got off on the wrong foot .  I'm not trying to be facetious or claim that bash is doing something wrong.  Clearly bash has been around for a long time and I'm sure it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
[19:40:09] <greycat> set -x adds quotes to things so that they can be pasted back into a shell.  the quotes that it adds are not necessarily the same ones you used.
[19:40:18] <greycat> # set -x; echo "foo bar"

[19:42:43] <Soliton> then ask a channel about gcc.
[19:43:22] <Guest1> so, in viewing the output from `set -x`, the only different I spotted was that it was treating that `EXPECTEDHASH={XX,XX,XX}` as if it had single quotes around it.  greycat might be right in that it's just me interpreting the output incorrectly, however.  Let me try to invoke it manually to see if I get the same error.

[21:30:01] <pj> right, that's what you want
[21:30:10] <pj> that matches the -0 for xargs
[21:30:11] *** Quits: wolfgang (~wolfgang@101.174.6.197) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:31:10] <pj> it uses null to separate filenames instead of \n, which is safer because null (\0) is not a valid character for a filename, but \n is.
[21:32:09] <bn_work> ah 👍
[21:34:51] <pj> okay, I'm off for the night

[22:03:36] <bn_work> BTW, do I need to invoke grep in a certain way to be able to pipe it to xargs?  I normally do things like `grep -IRwin blah | grep -v notBLOOP ` so it outputs the match with L #s 
[22:04:07] <greycat> if you're using grep -R, you don't use xargs
[22:04:59] <olspookishmagus> I want a script that I when will pass an arbitrary lines of input to it, it will output them back by prefixing those lines with a fixed string.
[22:05:20] <greycat> sed 's/^/fixed string/'
[22:12:21] <Soliton> bn_work: the solution pj suggested is using GNU grep -LZ to output the path of non-matching files delimited by NULs.

[23:37:47] <falfool> hi, can someone help me understand this change in behavior starting in bash 5.1.0? the following command no longer prints "hello" twice but only once: `bash -c 'cat /dev/fd/3 ; cat /dev/fd/3' 3<<< hello`

[23:38:37] <greycat> whether it actually does is not deterministic; depends on the platform and the size of the input, I think
[23:39:00] <greycat> relying on the implementation details (counting on there being a temp file) is not wise
