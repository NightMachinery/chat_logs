[00:04:45] <NoImNotNineVolt> is "get a hardware wallet" the same as "trust a third party"?
[00:05:30] <belcher> you could create a 2of2 multisig with hardware wallet and regular computer, then the hardware wallet manufacturer is much less of a single point of failure
[00:09:39] <ChoHag> Ultimately he's going to have to trust me that the protocol is secure and, if it uses a computer, that is too.

But hardware wallets in general are useful by helping you verify where you're sending and how much outside general use computers that are generally much more easily compromised by malware.

[01:16:11] <cluelessperson> ChoHag, either way, it all comes down to:

[01:17:46] <cluelessperson> 3. Can you learn the very basics about how cryptocurrency works?

[01:24:34] <ChoHag> Sorry too late.
[01:25:01] <ChoHag> You misunderstand the nature of the problem.
[01:25:42] <ChoHag> I'm not trying to secure bitcoin. I'm trying to come up with a protocol by which somebody who trusts me could buy bitcoin without having to trust me.
[01:25:56] <ChoHag> I already trust me.
[01:26:54] <ChoHag> My problem is I'm not good with interfacing with users.

[01:31:18] <cluelessperson> The reality is that people have grown up learning to use traditional money all of their lives.
[01:31:25] <ChoHag> Jesus I'm not going to, at least not for public consumption :P
[01:31:36] <cluelessperson> yeah, I misread that. :P
[01:31:58] <ChoHag> I got as far as implementing the VM and got bored at IO.
[01:32:03] <cluelessperson> With existing traditional money, we've all encountered scammers, robbers, liars, conmen, bank fraud, and more.
[01:32:33] <cluelessperson> We've all spent *decades* using cash in our wallets, learning ATMs, banking services, wire transfers and all that bullshit.
[01:32:55] <cluelessperson> To assume someone's just going to "understand the stock market instantly" without teaching, is not really how anything works.

[01:37:04] <cluelessperson> belcher, agreed.
[01:37:37] <belcher> fundamentally a bitcoin wallet is just a wallet... the user just needs to click buttons labelled "send", "receive", "create new wallet", "restore wallet from seed"
