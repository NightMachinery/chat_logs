[07:51:01] <Exterminador> hemimaniac: znc does have support for external SASL. you even can specify external and plain with external as 1st try and I think it will then fallback to plain if external fails. you can even set the znc to not connect if SASL isn't successful
[07:51:59] <hemimaniac> Thanks Exterminador
[07:52:26] <Exterminador> take a look at the [[sasl]] page, for more help
[07:52:26] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl
[07:54:09] <hemimaniac> AH HA, that the part i missed on first read Exterminador, the "utilizing the certificate" part, Thanks again
[07:54:26] <Exterminador> hemimaniac: you're welcome! :)
[07:57:25] <hemimaniac> One more quick question if you don't mind Exterminador 
[07:58:07] <Exterminador> sure. if I know the answer, I'll be glad to help
[07:59:16] <hemimaniac> The one network I sometimes use is rather slow, now with xchat I could use timers, with weechat (now) I can use command delay, is there a provision for that in there as well? Or does znc recognize that and do it's own thing?
[08:00:50] <Exterminador> znc does ask the network for SASL support on connect and will try to identify on connect if the network does have support for it. that should be kinda fast and work seemingly
[08:01:18] <Exterminador> other than that, you can also load the [[nickserv]] module as a backup
[08:01:18] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/nickserv
[08:02:41] <Exterminador> the nickserv module will try the usual "/nickserv identify password" after the connection has been completed
[08:03:06] <hemimaniac> Well they (the IRC.Net ion question still hasn't moved to SASL, so it log in, wait a couple secs, /msg nickserv........... , wait a couple more then /msg nickserv cloak........ , wait a couple more then /join
[08:04:39] <Exterminador> I don't think that znc have command delay *yet*. you could also try the [[perform]] module to make that requests automatically
[08:04:39] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/perform
[08:04:39] <hemimaniac> It ancient I know, but worth asking anyhow, if i need to leave that one client side I actually don't care, just askin'
[08:06:15] <Exterminador> but if you really need a certain delay to happen between commands, things get a bit complicated then
[08:06:39] <hemimaniac> I'll look into, and thanks again for the help Exterminador, enjoy the rest of the weekend, and ........

[08:35:41] <Exterminador> this little issue does makes me wonder how hard would be to add a timer delay to perform commands.. something like "/wait 5" to wait 5s between commands
[08:39:22] <hemimaniac> Well back in the days of the earlier xchat versions, you could point to a .txt file and "B00M", each empty line was 1 sec
[08:41:24] <hemimaniac> but with would I could decipher from the zinc man pages and the bit of code I've gleamed (before drinking heavily) /wait or /time <secs> <cmd> would be nifty
[08:41:55] <hemimaniac> oh ffs, auto correct went wild there
[08:45:00] <hemimaniac> I imagine injecting the straight up timer not the real issue, but getting znc to recognize it after a disconnect or after a drop, and after the dreaded netsplit I think would be the big bag 'o' magic

[09:52:27] <\\> yeah, it generally works, intil it decides to flood my phone while letting hexchat on my laptop get timeouts
[09:53:40] <\\> It manifests itself randomly on lone WHO messages, but almost all the time when reconencting a client or ZNC itself
[09:53:52] <\\> *reconnecting
[09:59:45] <hemimaniac> well TBH, I'm not sure about hex chat, but in weechat I know I can send that to the /server tab , and mute it until scroll back, you may want to look at checking 'Protect web  sessions, sounds like whilst yer moving about yer getting spammed when you jump IP addy's 
[10:00:29] <hemimaniac> But I'm still kinda new too
