[00:00:10] <Dagmar> Soni: By the way, enjoy using a system where very necessary specifiers are now _invisible_
[00:00:14] <[[R]]> ok, so what if you're editing a file like bashrc?
[00:00:25] <Soni> what about bashrc?
[00:00:32] <[[R]]> [12:27:32 PM] <[[R]]> and not to mention, if you use non printable characters as separators... how the hell do you type them
[00:00:42] <mlu> special keymap ;)
[00:00:48] <Soni> what's the problem...?
[00:00:50] <Dagmar> Forget typing them, even knowing they're there becomes a problem
[00:00:59] <Soni> oh yeah, the shell also needs builtins for building paths and whatnot
[00:01:01] <[[R]]> how do i put PATH=/bin:/usr/bin in my bashrc if i can't type the :?
[00:01:04] <mlu> technically, the enter key outputs a non-printable character that's often used as a separator (\n)

[01:25:10] <phogg> tacokoneko: you can ionice the process to be very nice, which will make it the loser in any I/O contention

[01:55:44] <tacokoneko> no it gradually consumed all the memory in my system and then swap so i had to terminate it before it made something bad happen
[01:56:20] <tacokoneko> no i do not want to modify the original files and directories in any way, i just want to create a compressed copy
[01:56:46] <matsaman> so some of the files in question are greater in size than the RAM you have available?
[01:56:48] <babyface> what does it mean that a somethingis "explicitly installed" ?

[01:58:48] <tacokoneko> the cumulative uncompressed size of all the data is around 2TB, and yes some individual files are larger than the local memory pool i would like to work with which is 40 GB

[03:21:43] <sublim20> alright, heres the situation:  i have a computer with 16gb emcc.  i've installed some lubuntu and have the machine setup pretty well.  but im running out of space.  theres an sd card slot on the thing.  here's my question:   can i somehow set it up such that linux installs or utilizes the programs from the sd card

[07:11:21] <Dagmar> mrjpaxton[m]: Some people do.  It's considerably easier once you get the hang of using ssh-agent

[07:11:34] <mrjpaxton[m]> If I was just going to use the SSH keys to make it faster, then I'd jut use the username's password. Why bother trying to remember a password for the SSH key, too?
[07:11:52] <Dagmar> You login, spin up ssh-agent, enter the key passphrase _once_ and from there things that need to will query ssh-agent when you connect
[07:11:56] <mrjpaxton[m]> Or "remember" as in KeepassXC. :)

[07:12:10] <pnbeast> mrjpaxton[m], yes, people prefer to password protect things that allow their accounts trivial access to other accounts.  But if you're really particular, because Linux, maybe you won't.
[07:12:25] *** Quits: player1 (~player1@user/player1) (Client Quit)
[07:12:26] <Dagmar> mrjpaxton[m]: Because a password-protected ssh key is reasonable secure against being stolen right off the machine
[07:12:49] <mrjpaxton[m]> Dagmar: Oh, yeah. I don't know much about ssh-agent.
[07:13:01] <Dagmar> That's one of the things you should read about
[07:13:01] <CoderCop> mrjpaxton[m]: If someone were to get access to your keys (say, a backup of your home directory got leaked somehow) then they could access every box you own if they aren't passworded. With passwords, they still couldn't do anything. As several people have mentioned, ssh-agent means you don't (generally) have to type a password more than once per session.
[07:13:12] <Dagmar> Used _properly_, ssh makes logging into remote systems considerably easier
[07:13:57] <Dagmar> 'spesh since ssh-agent can let you just keep the private key on your _laptop_ and nowhere else (instead of copying the thing everywhere like some lunatics do)
[07:14:20] <knotMez> ssheit!
[07:14:22] <mrjpaxton[m]> I've, for a long time, just logged into an SSH session with the regular user's password. And I still don't see anything wrong with it. Guess it's the whole convenience vs security thing I need to take into consideration, really.
[07:14:30] <Dagmar> It's like having your own personal GSSAPI setup, without the screaming AD admin to deal with
[07:14:42] <[[R]]> mrjpaxton[m]: and when your account gets brute forced, and then compormised...
[07:14:52] <Dagmar> mrjpaxton[m]: Many of us just turn passwords _off_ for the accounts we're using ssh with
[07:15:03] <Dagmar> Like, you'll never find me doing a root login with a password
[07:15:17] <Dagmar> Some stuff tho I allow remote root login using the right ssh keys
[07:15:22] *** Quits: pepee (~user@user/pepee) (Quit: bye $IRC)

[07:15:40] <[[R]]> who said antyhing about root
[07:15:49] <CoderCop> All of my servers are configured to disallow root login (regardless) and to disallow password login for all users. So, to get root, someone would have to get a private key, get the private key password, then get the actual user password for that user as well to sudo. (Assuming no other vulnerability)

[07:16:23] <knotMez> [[R]] no other way
[07:16:39] <mrjpaxton[m]> So when you disable password login, that means you have to use SSH keys to login, right?
[07:16:54] <mrjpaxton[m]> Otherwise you're locked out from SSH.
[07:17:05] <joelchrono12> indeed
[07:17:23] <Dagmar> Yeah and you can disable/enable passwords for accounts in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

[07:18:16] <knotMez> CoderCop in case of fire use the ax behind the glass
[07:18:18] <Dagmar> The reason remote root with ssh keys is less horrifying than usual is that sshd logs _which_ key was used to grant access, so... you avoid the biggest boojum... loss of Accountability
[07:18:35] <[[R]]> knotMez: what if the fire melted the glass?
[07:18:38] <mrjpaxton[m]> Well, there's also "ssh_config" to be concerned about. A lot of the systems I use seem to have both an SSH client and server both installed.

[07:18:50] <knotMez>  [[R]] just grab the handle

[10:52:45] <kurahaupo> jackiee: to "root" an Android phone, you generally have to start with a "non consumer build of Android", either a public one like CyanogenMod, or an in-house one if you work for a phone OEM
[10:53:36] <Sauvin> Rooting means accepting the risk of bricking, no?
[10:54:41] <kurahaupo> Sauvin: yes, but modern Android phones must have at least two boot partitions, and a way to select one at power up, so that's pretty unlikely unless you try to root it twice

[11:57:44] <TJ-> Problems with snaps are greater than in that article; especially on Ubuntu where there's a feeling of bait-n-switch because we get users wanting support and because Canonical is putting core parts of the installed OS into snaps only, we first have to check if there is a snap involved, and if so point out that there is no community support for snaps, need to contact the publisher, and so on.

[13:16:38] <alkisg> dminuoso: the point was if the manufacturer claimed a different capacity than what parted -l showed; not if the .iso fit or not

[13:16:54] <dminuoso> alkisg: like I pointed out three times: yes.
[13:17:09] <alkisg> Yeah, I can't believe that, sorry :)
[13:17:16] <dminuoso> the manufacturer claimed 4GB (o GiB, dont recall), but it was slightly less on some, and it varied some.
[13:17:22] <dminuoso> Fair.
[13:17:29] <alkisg> I've never seen it in any brand, and sandisk is one of the best
[13:17:42] <varighet> it's the same for hard drives
[13:17:44] <dminuoso> What do you base that description "best" on?
[13:17:55] <varighet> there's small differences between 8TB disks from different vendors
[13:17:56] <dminuoso> Our experience has a sample size of 200, what's yours?
[13:18:04] <dminuoso> Or is yours rooted on just a feeling?
[13:18:10] <alkisg> In hard drives the number of sectors is usually written in the label. That one too is accurate
[13:18:16] <sublim20> hey all
[13:18:18] <varighet> and it's especially irritating if you plan to build full disk arrays that require equal partition sizes
[13:18:26] <dminuoso> Yes, with hard drives we never had any such problem. Just with usb flash drives.
[13:18:48] <varighet> it's one of the reasons why people recommend making partitions that are slightly smaller, to accommodate tiny variations in disk sizes across multiple vendors
[13:19:05] <alkisg> dminuoso: no, it's based on multiple online reviews and the official recommendation for rasbperries. I read all that when I was selecting the best sd card to buy, as I had issues with many of the previous ones
[13:19:14] <lockywolf> ahh.. it seems that upower is broadcasting something to dbus for hibernation
[13:19:18] <alkisg> dminuoso: but in any case, that's not really an interesting topic anymore, let's move on :)

If I do instead `ngrep -W byline -p port 80` that would get the WAN traffic as well , any ideas?

[21:12:42] <Dagmar> p-i-_: Basically, you go into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and you put in ONE line that starts with 'ssh-rsa' then has a space, and then paste all of the binhex from the middle of the PEM file you got from PuTTY as _one line_ with _no whitespace_
