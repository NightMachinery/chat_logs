[01:47:13] <MrElendig> bleb: trawling trough mailing lists takes much more work than having everything presented directly in a nice web interface
[01:47:21] <kevr> bleb: GitLab allows you to link between different issues, link to commits, link to MRs, link to.. almost anything on gitlab, that doesn't really exist with a mailing list unless someone decides to implement a wrapper, and that gets nasty quick
[01:47:30] <kevr> It allows you to do a lot that can speed up productivity.
[01:47:51] <kevr> arch already did that with the whole bug thing and mailing lists, with the [FS#....] tag thing
[01:47:53] <bleb> MrElendig: what can that possibly mean... there are web interfaces to mailing lists, and native interfaces which are even better than any web interface
[01:47:53] <MrElendig> not to mention intigrate with testing frameworks etc

[06:07:06] <alschaapman> eternal_floof: Just a hunch, but if the boot continues without intervention, my guess is that systemd is just deciding that something has gone wrong due to something like an incorrect ordering dependency
[06:07:24] <Namarrgon> you can mount the /-fs to /new_root and then continue the boot process by exiting the shell
[06:07:38] <Namarrgon> at least on the busybox-based initramfs
[06:07:59] <Namarrgon> in the systemd-based on you won't be able to get to a shell because the root account is disabled

[07:09:32] <alschaapman> Are "thick" LVM snapshots even copy-on-write?
[07:09:37] <vd> hi roxxors -- any idea why downloads from a local `python -m http.server` instance is reaaaally slow?
[07:10:03] <alschaapman> At any rate, I think it's best to use Btrfs snapshots if you're going to use Btrfs
[07:10:39] <alschaapman> LVM is probably okay to combine with Btrfs if you're not thin provisioning

[07:11:35] <eternal_floof> yes, may I never touch an LVM snapshot again :D   thanks so much again. Always a panic attack staring at the black screen of doom
[07:11:57] <alschaapman> Any time
[07:12:08] <alschaapman> 👍
[07:12:59] <alschaapman> FWIW snapper with thin logical volumes and XFS is pretty good for my use
[07:13:26] <alschaapman> But I also like Btrfs for features. Just don't use it for anything currently

[12:09:10] <raster> at least steam games seem to suspend screensaver while steam runs i've noticed. (there is an x screensaver extension protocol where a client can request screensaver suspend - this suspension can be lifted by the client and is auto-lifted if the client dies/crashes etc. - and it allows multiple clients to request it isensibly so that as long as at least 1 client asks for suspension it's suspended)

[21:06:04] <shadowbird2468> no quick answers, so I'll probably post it in forum and carry on with my next problem for now.. so, I like to have my system in english, therefor I used US_en local in setup and added KEYMAPS=fi to vconsole for my finnish keyboard, but that doesnt seem to work. I went around hte problems by adding a line to my I3 config to change it from there, but I'm wondering if there is a better way to make 
[21:06:10] <shadowbird2468> it work. (I asume it should work without adding this exec setckbmap -layout fi to i3 config)

[23:13:03] <tirnanog> grazzolini: I'm not sure you understand. if you have +r on a dir, you can enumerate its entries. it doesn't matter who owns said entries or even what their modes are.
[23:13:53] <tirnanog> however, with only +r rights, what you can't do is get any other information about a given entry (ownership, modes, size ... etc).
[23:14:16] <tirnanog> and it's that same characteristic that affects the ability to traverse.

[23:27:07] <susi> would be interesting to understand how can the filesystem make file a/b/c non-stat-able when a is 444, but b and c are 777
[23:27:18] <tirnanog> here's an example of the constraint in action: https://termbin.com/02tu
[23:28:49] <teraflops> all the fonts are monochrome there are only a few that actually show the unicode chars coloured
[23:29:22] <tirnanog> susi: ultimately, by people deciding that this is how conventional discretionary access controls will behave and by the posix specifications keeping everyone on the same page.
[23:29:32] <tirnanog> keeping implementors, even.
[23:29:39] *** Quits: somlis (~somlis@user/somlis) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[23:30:02] <tirnanog> it makes more sense when you consider that a directory is really just a kind of file.
[23:30:14] <tirnanog> linux won't let you open a directory as if it were a file but some other operating systems do.
[23:30:54] <tirnanog> in that respect, the directory contains data which can be (r)ead.

[23:33:53] <susi> could I write a C program to skip DAC/ACL and access x (777) inside a (444), or who stops me?
[23:34:06] <tirnanog> the kernel stops you.
[23:34:14] *** Joins: Szadek (~Szadek@185.213.155.252)
[23:34:28] <tirnanog> your C program does not have the privilege of running in kernel space, obviously.
[23:35:34] <tirnanog> the only way you could circumvent it, short of a theoreticaly vulnerability is if, say, you had direct read permissions for the block device node containing the filesystem.
[23:35:39] <tirnanog> theoretical*
[23:35:58] <tirnanog> in which case all of the filesystem data is exposed to you, if you figure out how to process it.

[23:43:18] <hombrelaser> Hello, so I updated my motherboard's bios, and now the boot I can't access my GRUB boot partition. Do I need to reinstall GRUB in the boot partition?
[23:43:58] <susi> tirnanog: thanks :)
[23:44:54] <kevr> hombrelaser: Perhaps your mother board bios update reverted your settings for things like Secure boot?
[23:44:56] <MrElendig> hombrelaser: uefi?
[23:45:15] <MrElendig> usually its just the boot order that changes
[23:45:24] <kevr> ah
[23:45:28] <MrElendig> but yes, secureboot settings too can
[23:45:34] <MrElendig> and csm
[23:45:53] <hombrelaser> Yes, UEFI, I marked the boot as uefi only on my mobo's settings.
[23:46:08] <hombrelaser> The grub partition doesn't get listed in the bootable devices
[23:46:10] <MrElendig> protip: install the bootloader to the default loader path
[23:46:19] <MrElendig> define "grub partition"
