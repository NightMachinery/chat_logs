[04:10:44] <jaguart> this article indicates that -y does nothing for **update** https://embeddedinventor.com/sudo-apt-get-update-y-command-explained-for-beginners/ - I guess you just have to consider the max downside. If something goes wrong your package list might not get updated, or might need to be reconstructed. AFAIK it has no need to touch the sources.list files
[04:10:44] <jaguart> so you might just need to clear the package cache.

[04:13:22] <n4dir> as said, in those ~15 years of using debian or debian based i never saw anyone using or recommending -y with update
[04:13:48] <n4dir> though there are many things i didn't see, but an apt-get update seems regular enough to have seen it at least once

[08:35:46] <cornjulio> have not tried debian am curious how it differs from ubuntu i assume it modular in that you choose what you want to install?
[08:36:12] <cornjulio> no de no x y z if not installed its not there?
[08:36:45] <KNERD> Ubuntu tends to have newer stuff, and tends to be more buggy
[08:37:08] <cornjulio> does a debian install have a de or tile manager by default
[08:37:08] <KNERD> I tried the newest Ubuntu 20.x and took it off and put Debian back on
[08:37:37] <cornjulio> the thing that scares me on deb is not having a gui if i get stuck
[08:37:48] <cornjulio> but im sure that can be overcome
[08:37:58] <cornjulio> eg install one lol
[08:38:01] <labrador> theres gdebi
[08:38:10] <cornjulio> whats that
[08:38:13] <somiaj> Debian provides you the choice of many DEs and WMs to choose from.
[08:38:16] <cornjulio> ill man it
[08:38:28] <somiaj> The installer only lists the DEs, but you can choose not to install any then manually install the window manager of your choice.
[08:38:30] <KNERD> I use Cinnamon myself
[08:38:38] <cornjulio> oooh sweet
[08:38:50] <labrador> Oh you were asking for something else
[08:38:52] <labrador> sorry
[08:39:07] <cornjulio> nah your on point im just all over the place
[08:39:57] <cornjulio> thanks for all the info gonna spin up a session later now im aware of gdebi n de situation
[08:40:36] <cornjulio> updating system still sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y or :ugrade-y
[08:40:36] <KNERD> i did upgrade to v11 on my oldest laptop . I am not liking how the menu bar is a giant now like it is on a 1024x768 monitor
[08:40:59] <cornjulio> on debian i mean?
[08:41:23] <KNERD> yes, but you have to change to the name of the version in the sources.list file
[08:41:33] <cornjulio> cool thanks

[15:12:02] <labrador> Nah,but could be who knows

[16:01:02] <kwoot> @PerfDave. That's the thing. At one location it can either be dhcp or static, at the other location is has to be static with another ip range

[16:03:08] <PerfDave> Ah OK. That sounds a bit harder to solve; I wonder if running a DHCP server at both locations is less work ;)
[16:05:48] <kwoot> Well loc1 has a dhcp server, on loc2 the system IS the dhcp server :-) System is a RPI and will switch between home and 2nd home. At  2nd home it will be dhcp server, dns server, ntp server, etc. at 1st home it is just a node that hopefully does not respond to dhcp queries, but no biggy if it would.

[18:26:50] <esv> just don't ask me for the details, don't know
[18:29:25] <kwoot> Hi all. Some answers for @Khepra and @esv. I want different subnets in case I ever configure a vpn between them. And running Ansbible every time I boot up some pi seems way too complex for this case. I want the box to configure automatically and autonomously.
[18:30:13] <Khepra> kwoot: automatically requries a database/arbiter that will assign proper config based on <criteria> . sounds a bit of an overkill
[18:31:03] <Khepra> semi-automatic could be done, say, by having two grub boot menu entries. each has a cmdline param that a custom systemd service, for example, reads on boot and applies proper network config
[18:31:21] <kwoot> Well, what it does now is run a systemd script at the end of the boot process. That script does 1 ping and if it can't reach my homeserver, it must me located somewhere else :-).
[18:31:34] <Khepra> full automation is something via cloud-init (but requires the said arbiterr). or ansible that queries a central config server.
[18:31:37] <kwoot> And can also manually being run.
[18:31:58] <Khepra> that sounds error prone
[18:32:50] <kwoot> well, if is at location 2 it should default to setting to his own settings and when at location 1 I can hook up a screen and keyboard and fiddle wit it.
[18:32:58] <Khepra> I mean _this_ is precisely what DHCP was designed for. I still don't understand why you just don't use dhcp
[18:33:21] <kwoot> location 1 has a dhcp server. At location 2 the device IS the dhcp server.
[18:33:40] <Khepra> so what if it "is" the server? doesn it not respond to DHCPQUERY?

[18:34:57] <Khepra> you're moving around a server
[18:35:14] <Khepra> anyway ... in such circumstances, the dhcp server _must_ have a static upstream/nexthop gateway, yes?*
[18:35:31] <kwoot> yes
[18:36:07] <Khepra> then maybe your solution is suitable. understanding of course that "suitable" here is based on the flawed premise: you're moving a server around.
[18:36:23] <kwoot> that is going to be a MikroTik RBLHGR with modem R11e-LTE6
[18:36:34] <Khepra> if I were you, I'd use the grub menu option
[18:36:51] <kwoot> Yes, well, if we would live in a perfect world some OS'ses would never have seen the light of day :-)
[18:37:06] <Khepra> default starts with regular DHCP thingy.  when you move it to location #2 where it becomes the server, and you say you can "fiddle" via console, jsut select the "server" grub menu profile
[18:37:45] <kwoot> I can fiddel at home/location 1, I want a default good setup without any fiddling at location 2
[18:37:59] <Khepra> same recommendation applies.
[18:38:11] <nunggu> guessnet may be helpful in this case
[18:38:16] <Khepra> you define "default" (no fiddling with grub menu) to behave for location #2. you create a non-default grub menu for selection at location #1

[18:40:41] <Khepra> you could go even as far as using hardware.  plug-in an usb for a on-boot service to trigger on its existence and do config A. if the thing ain't plugged in, do config B.

[22:15:35] <celphi> Khepra: basically i bought a new laptop. i install bullseye - but my wifi drivers were not working. so i read online i needed to upgrade to a newer kernel to get the ROG Zephyrus drivers. so i followed the guide on https://www.linuxcapable.com/how-to-install-or-upgrade-to-linux-kernel-5-14-on-debian-11-bullseye/ to upgrade my kernel
[22:16:21] <celphi> basically it had me add "unstable" to my sources.lst file. it did all the downloads ect and i rebooted. but now instead of it going to gui desktop i get blinking cursor

[22:16:43] <celphi> i am able to log into root though from cli using ctrl+alt+f2
[22:16:53] <Khepra> problem is, that's some low grade bullshit advice on that site. one does not simply mix stable and sid without knowing what they're doing
[22:16:55] <celphi> but i cant access the gui desktop
[22:17:01] <Khepra> QED
[22:17:25] <celphi> so what's your suggestion?
[22:17:37] <celphi> bc i can easily redo it all from iso
[22:17:38] <Khepra> go buy amd
[22:17:45] <Khepra> jokes aside...    here's the thing.
[22:17:49] <celphi> i have amd
[22:18:01] <celphi> are you talking about graphics card?
[22:18:06] <celphi> i have amd processor
[22:18:13] <Khepra> I meant amdgpu.    now, nvidia drivers (proprietary) support only up to certain linux kernel versions. methinks 460 in stable does up to 5.11 so your 5.15 is not gonna work
[22:18:30] <celphi> no i need nvidia for cuda support - im using this for machine learning
[22:18:42] <Khepra> this is simple to see, if during installation DKMS failed compiling, that's probably the reason: unsupported kernel version
[22:19:09] <celphi> i dont think it failed if i can get to root right?
[22:19:20] <celphi> it just doesnt start gui
[22:19:37] <Khepra> you can get into your system by forcing it to text mode.  in grub menu, hit e to edit current entry, find the linux vmlinuz line and append   systemd.unit=multi-user.target   to the end of it, hit F10 to continue booting that entry.   might wanna remove "quiet" so you can see errors verbosely
[22:20:05] <Khepra> celphi: I'm talking about failure during installation. did you pay attention that the apt upgrade went without issues?
[22:20:07] <celphi> ya i removed the "quiet" portion
[22:20:17] <celphi> ya no issue during upgrade
[22:20:41] <Khepra> once you boot into text mode, login on the console as root (or as your user, and then su -l  to root)

[23:50:05] <Khepra> uhm.... did you run   apt install nvida-driver  ?
[23:50:16] <celphi> yes earlier says it's installed
[23:50:18] <Khepra> THAT should've installed all the dpendencies, gcc and dkms and everything.... actually, headers included
[23:50:33] <Khepra> apt install build-essential
[23:50:57] <celphi> missing dependcies

[23:52:01] <Khepra> apt install build-essential
[23:52:02] <towo-home> then your sources are wrong
[23:52:27] <Khepra> can't be missing according to the sources.list and the prefeences pin you pasted
[23:52:57] <Khepra> unless that apt preference pin is totally wrong; and here we go, orbiting back to frankendebian and why it's a no-no :)

[23:54:38] <Khepra> this looks like a broken system yes. I'm not expert in pinning and can't tell if that pin you pasted is the cause here
[23:55:00] <celphi> tell you what-- ill just redo it to 5.10
[23:55:25] <Khepra> what I did when I ....frankendebianized.... mesa, before I reverted to backporting,    was I pinned usntabled to -1 priority. absolutely disabling it, and then I explicitely had a whitelist for packages from sid
[23:55:46] <Khepra> I'm afraid that pin you have pulled in a bit more than it should've
