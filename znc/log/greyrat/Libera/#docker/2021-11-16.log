[00:23:16] <rawtaz> o hello, never expected to see you here!
[00:23:44] <jezebel> does anyone have a guide as to how to use the golang:latest image as a development environment?
[00:23:47] <jezebel> rawtaz…  :P
[00:23:48] <rawtaz> please tell us the exact docker command you used to run it
[00:24:23] <jezebel> docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/go/src:rw" --user 1000:1000 -w "/go/src" golang:latest
[00:24:49] <jezebel> if i include --user 1000:1000 go complains that it cant create /.cache
[00:25:27] <jezebel> if i exclude it i cant write to /go/src because that's 0755 and owned by 1000:1000
[00:25:28] <rawtaz> right. that should be because your $PWD is not allowing, with the regular filesystem permissions, the user with UID 1000 to write to it
[00:26:04] <rawtaz> you are creating a bind mount with that -v, this means that the container sees what you see in . and that also includes permissions of those files and folders
[00:26:17] <jezebel> my PWD is on a NFS share and I also get an error about Rlocks
[00:27:02] <jezebel> i should have permissions, let me check
[00:27:16] <rawtaz> what does `ls -la` tell you about permissions on $PWD ?
[00:28:50] <jezebel> stat says 0755 hmmm
[00:28:58] <jezebel> stat .
[00:29:37] <jezebel> so my local dir needs to be 0777
[00:29:38] <jezebel> hmmm
[00:30:58] <jezebel> ok that wrked on resolving writability

[00:48:28] <brandonbloom> I'm having trouble with --log-driver=syslog on mac. If I do something like `nc -l 43550` to listen, then docker run with `--log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=tcp://localhost:43550`, i get `docker: Error response from daemon: failed to initialize logging driver: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:43550: connect: connection refused.` - but that port is
[00:48:29] <brandonbloom> definitely being listened to! not sure why the connection is being refused. any debugging suggestions much appreciated! thanks
[00:49:30] <programmerq> brandonbloom▸ because the dockerd has a localhost inside the VM that docker for mac sets up for you and that's different than your localhost on your mac.
[00:50:48] <programmerq> see https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds - there's a section "I want to connect from a container to a service on the host" and that *should* work for the dockerd trying to connect via syslog to your mac host.
[00:51:17] <brandonbloom> programmerq: my understanding was that this is the daemon connecting to the service, where localhost is not inside the container
[00:51:55] <programmerq> dockerd is not in a container. it is in a VM
[00:51:58] <programmerq> that VM is not your mac.
[00:52:01] <brandonbloom> gotcha. thanks
[00:52:04] <brandonbloom> gateway.docker.internal does in fact work
[00:52:08] <brandonbloom> appreciate it!

[01:10:55] <akik> the wsl 2 vm gets a new ip on every reboot
[01:11:10] <queue[m]> yes but we've always been able to define what IP that is
[01:11:25] <queue[m]> i do it all the time in any other environment other than WSL2
[01:11:45] <queue[m]> so this wsl 2 'container'
[01:11:54] <queue[m]> it should show the IP im trying to pipe out to it
[01:12:18] <queue[m]> instead, i get the docker-set IP: inet 172.25.74.153/20 brd 172.25.79.255 scope global eth0
[01:12:46] <queue[m]> and btw, on reboot these ip's dont change
[01:13:00] <queue[m]> it would only change if i made an alteration or deleted the 'pihole_default' network itself

[13:54:16] <faceface> I'm trying to run this image:
[13:54:21] <faceface> https://github.com/pierlon/scrcpy-docker
[13:54:49] <faceface> but with a newer version of scrcpy (v1.16 doesn't work with Android 12)
[13:55:36] <faceface> the version of the file I created with minimal changes is here for reference: https://github.com/dbolser/scrcpy-docker/blob/feature/scrcpy-v1.19/Dockerfile
[13:55:49] <faceface> However... It's crashing
[13:56:10] *** Joins: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious)
[13:56:43] <faceface> The instructions just say, `xhost + local:docker`... is that enough to give the docker image full access to my host X server?
[13:57:03] <faceface> The developer thinks it may be a permission issue in the sdl library in the container:

[19:46:09] <tabakhase> there is some old mod to the local driver that can do that... - but programmerq had posted some stuff a few days that supposedly "volumes" also support random paths if created with the long-long form syntax or so... not entirely positive on this tho

[19:50:16] <Thanzex> Do you know of a way to migrate from a normal volume to a bindmount? 
[19:50:54] <tabakhase> "docker cp" to pull it out and make a new one with it

[20:00:12] <programmerq> Thanzex▸ yes, you can copy the data and then recreate your container with the new bind mount setup.

[20:18:05] <programmerq> https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/ubuntu - there are several architectures listed here. specifying it with --platform against the main library image "--platform abc123 ubuntu" is taking advantage of the multiarch image stuff on that main 'ubuntu' repository. a given tag would point to a different set of blobs depending on the requested platform. The
[20:18:07] <programmerq> <arch>/<image> namespace is a pattern that was used when the multiarch repository/image stuff was still being worked on. As far as I know they're the same bits, but the latter simply has one tag for that one platform
