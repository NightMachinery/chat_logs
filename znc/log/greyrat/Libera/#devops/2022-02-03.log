[00:02:21] <rawtaz> i also found https://www.openproject.org last night if i didnt say that
[00:08:55] <lantech19446> I need to ask this because I don't know if this is just my mental illness showing through of it it's normal. Do you guys run into spells where you just stop studying stuff like no matter how much you know you need to 
[00:09:53] <kubblai> i do yes lantech19446 but im nuts as well :)
[00:10:41] <lantech19446> lol I guess I should expect that, most of the people in the depression channel work in IT lol

[00:11:02] <kubblai> give yourself a break man the study stuff will be there when you're ready for it
[00:11:09] <lantech19446> I have bipolar disorder and this is the first time in my life I can remember not being depressed but I still have a lot of depressive habits

[00:11:51] <kubblai> well if you're not depressed just enjoy and dont feel any pressure
[00:12:19] <slaughter> If the brain wants a break, give the brain a break
[00:13:46] <lantech19446> I started learning python and it's been really hard to continue and normally I try to learn a couple things at once. I'm fairly basic at ansible but it's enough to say i have some experience with it and I can figure out what i need to for the most part. I don't know if I want to do some more in depth linux studies or move to docker and then on top of that is the whole i don't feel like doing any of
[00:13:48] <lantech19446> it thing lol

[00:14:46] <kubblai> your last post just reminded me to take a break from the computer and go meditate, chao
[00:16:56] <lantech19446> ttyl kubblai 
[00:17:44] <lantech19446> slaughter: I think you're right man i'm so worried about falling behind again though and at the same time it's going to be so hard to leave this job so I don't know if it's even worth it 
[00:19:23] <slaughter> If you want to learn it ofc it's worth it
[00:21:41] <lantech19446> I don't know what all I should be learning to help me at this job vs potentially preparing me for another one. I've come to the realization that I can't buy health benefits like these on the private market so moving is going to come with a lot more expense and potentially a loss of the very doctors who have completely unfucked my life
[00:21:54] <slaughter> There'a a great quote I can't find about this. Goes something like "The pursuit of knowledge for it's own sake is a worthy ambition"
[00:26:04] <lantech19446> probably, idk I'm stuck in between indecisive and inattentive lol this is not a fun place to be stuck but still far better than the ambitious but not motivated that i've been for the last 30yrs
[00:31:41] <rawtaz> it has to be fun and interesting, otherwise theres no point

[01:23:46] <rawtaz> hum. i have a weird issue.. im using traefik with docker, and everything has been working fine earlier today. i havent changed anything, in particular in the traefik and gitea containers. despite this, for some reason traefik no longer shows a route for the gitea, and the domain of course gives a 404 then.
[01:24:06] <rawtaz> here's what docker inspect says about the gitea container - one can clearly see the correct labels applied: https://kopy.io/dZf6A
[01:24:27] <rawtaz> if i check the traefik dashboard i do see the gitea http endpoint, but no route/rule for it :O
[01:25:32] <rawtaz> if i check the traefik *logs*, i do see "Adding route for ..." for the other containers i have, but not the gitea one.
[01:25:36] <rawtaz> insanely odd.
[01:25:46] <rawtaz> ive restarted both traefik and gitea.
[01:26:41] <rawtaz> i do however see in the traefik logs "Adding certificate for domain(s) git.domain.com" so it does see part of it so to speak. just not the rule/route
[01:26:47] <rawtaz> (which i *definitely* didnt change)
[01:27:21] <slaughter> Take it out back and shoot it
[01:27:33] <slaughter> Won't mess with you any more
[01:27:47] <slaughter> Alternatively take on of it's friends out back and shoot that, which should spur it to cooperate
[01:28:04] <rawtaz> hehe
[01:28:08] <rawtaz> why not
[01:28:35] <slaughter> I wish I could give you something helpful but all my experience with Traefik comes from looking at a diagram and telling people we didn't need it for what we were doing
[01:28:58] <rawtaz> gotcha
[01:29:13] <rawtaz> ive been running it for a while now and it hasnt failed, been good. this one is just a mystery
[01:29:35] <slaughter> Trade ya though, I'll figure that out and you can figure out why this deployment is being a sunuva
[01:30:02] <slaughter> I can even lead with a hint: the problem lies somewhere in AWS copilot-cli
[01:30:16] <slaughter> And agree immediately that the issue is probably that we're using copilot-cli in the first place
[01:34:11] <rawtaz> slaughter: im done figuring out my problem. how's it going with yours? :-)

[01:38:47] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: is it possible that a middleware is being odd?
[01:39:12] <slaughter> rawtaz still waiting out the ECS circuit breaker to try the next thing
[01:39:29] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: one thing that annoys me about traefik is that it's hard to get it to explain what's actually upsetting it, it just refuses to start a route
[01:39:53] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: the cause was that another (third) container, which also was fronted by traefik, had this in its labels:  traefik.http.routers.git.middlewares=ipwhitelist-nextcloud  instead of  traefik.http.routers.nextcloud.middlewares=ipwhitelist-nextcloud
[01:40:17] <rawtaz> so for some reason *that* made it take over the gitea container's route or something. at least it messed things up for traefik
[01:40:25] *** Quits: i0 (~i0@51.15.3.183) (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
[01:40:31] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: yeah its certainly hard to debug traefik..
[01:40:53] <rawtaz> i have 10000% debugging as much as possible in the logs, even then its hard to make sense of it and theres things lacking
[01:41:12] <rawtaz> but thats good brain training isnt it. having to think harder :P
[01:43:38] <rawtaz> im not giving up on it! :)
[01:43:39] <slaughter> Logs? What are logs? Plz sir may I have some logs?
[01:43:53] <slaughter> ECS over here like "lol logs why would you need those"
[01:43:57] <rawtaz> slaughter: yeah as soon as you run your own instance of AWS you can get some logs to poke at
[01:44:24] <slaughter> Sounds horrible, I guess I can do without logs

[02:23:52] <slaughter> ECS deployment via copilot-cli
[02:24:55] <slaughter> copilot-cli is hot garbage
[02:25:33] <slaughter> I mean, when it works it's good enough and whatever it let the devs build some big stuff before we devops douchebags rolled in...but when it doesn't work all you have is that stupid fking line to debug with
[02:26:00] <slaughter> There's _nothing_ to tell you why a deployment is failing
[02:27:36] <rawtaz> not even on the ECS side of things? i would expect there to be some monitoring/logging/dashboard there
[02:30:06] <slaughter> Nope. I'm actually trying to deploy the New Relic ECS integration lol
[02:30:19] <slaughter> If the container deploys and the actual app is the issue there's logs

[14:15:44] <Deknos> if you use that many different stacks, you tend to forget the eccentries of each one... switch weekly between bash, python, ruby and perl for example for, foreach, ||, do i need now $ for variables?

[14:17:12] <Deknos> yeah, but to easy examples. THESE ones i know. :D
