[00:18:45] <euouae> Hello
[00:18:54] <irek> o/
[00:19:30] <euouae> irek, so about fold-this, I looked into it, and it uses elisp's Overlays.
[00:20:04] <euouae> Unfortunately my doom-emacs session does not recover fold-this; not sure why, maybe because that info is stored in memory
[00:20:22] <euouae> so I'm going to eventually hack my own thing, but for now, I'm using fold-this :) it helps. thank you
[00:20:47] <euouae> but I just wanted to say, elisp's Overlays are exactly the sort of concept that one needs to show/hide text (or otherwise manipulate it) in a region
[00:20:57] <irek> happy to help
[00:21:54] <irek> yea, many modes uses that but there is no build in Emacs interactive functions that can do it for selected region like fold-this does.  At least I never found it

[00:23:20] <euouae> I want to write one extension that lets you save your hidden regions
[00:23:52] <euouae> it would also be nice to provide a few different things one can do to a region: highlight background color, color the sidebar (like magit when diff) or fold (like fold-this)
[00:24:22] <euouae> as well as maintaining different groups of 'hidden regions' as well as saving them so that you can reload them
[00:24:48] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)

[00:25:10] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:28:57] <irek> Hmm I was thinking how I deal with situations when I have file with places that I want to keep track of.  Usually I just copy them to empty tmp buffer.  For smaller parts I use `highlight-regexp'.  In code I put temporary comments
[00:29:04] *** Quits: jatt (~jatt@user/jatt) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:30:15] <euouae> copying to buffers can be annoying
[00:30:44] <euouae> for example if you copy a part of a file, and turn on some modes, you get syntax highlighting; but maybe the part you copied is incomplete and then get errors/squigly lines, etc
[00:31:24] <euouae> as a concrete example, I was just reading a C file and I hid all the error checking (stuff like if(return_value == -1) { /* cleanup... */ })
[00:32:02] <euouae> this turns the file into a leaner thing that you can follow, where there's 10 visible lines and each one is meaningful (InitStuff(), OpenConnection(), DoThing(), etc...)
[00:33:31] <irek> Oh I see but that's a bit different scenario.  For that I also use fold-this.

[00:34:08] <euouae> fold-this puts [[..]] as a symbol, it would be cool if I could alter the .. into a custom message. That's another idea ... [[networking connect() error checking]]
[00:34:36] <irek> in example of C you could use dedicated `hs-minor-mode'
[00:35:06] <irek> But personally I don't like it
[00:35:16] <euouae> Me neither :P it requires thinking about what you're trying to hide
[00:35:21] <euouae> I'd rather just hide lines/regions

[00:35:58] <ndegruchy> Could you use narrowing?

[00:51:42] <euouae> that's why it doesn't work for me
[00:51:51] <euouae> e.g. if you want to hide some block in lines 20-30 of a 100-line file
[00:51:59] <euouae> you don't want to "narrow" to 1-19 & 21-100
[00:52:05] <euouae> You'd rather just... hide 20-30
[00:52:38] <euouae> of course this can be solved with just the appropriate command that does the complementary thing. So I should definitely look into this
[00:52:40] <corwin> I'm not sure I understand then.  I thought you originally asked for a way to highlight several regions in a buffer based on line numbers.

[00:55:06] <euouae> I'm going to look into multiple narrowings later, it might actually be what I need. :)
[00:55:45] <euouae> though it seems more about providing non-contiguous regions (and thus editing) than just visual non-editing stuff

[03:41:37] <corwin> Yeah, i see it calling `select-frame-set-input-focus' which has an unconditional call to raise-frame
[03:42:23] <moon-child> hmm, but if I do (defun raise-frame (&optional frame) nil), then running raise-frame directly has no effect, but previous-multiframe-window still raises the window
[03:42:52] <moon-child> I don't really know elisp; perhaps that definition is local or something?
[03:43:03] <corwin> I guess you could try wrapping it in your own function that uses (cl-letf ((raise-frame #'ignore) (previous-multiframe-window)) or some such
[03:43:49] <moon-child> no dice
[03:44:00] <corwin> redefining core function will often not do what you expect because byte-compiled code may still ref the origina
[03:44:30] <corwin> probably even worse for function implemented in c, which I'd suspect to be the case with raise-frame

[05:59:32] <johnjaye> probably something wrong with arch if it's a new install then.
[05:59:48] <johnjaye> you can always compile emacs yourself from the github mirror. it's usually pretty straightforward on debian.
[06:00:00] <jtgd> X windows works for other things though
[06:00:03] <johnjaye> i just run .configure and then try to install the jpeg, gif, tiff, xpm and other libraries
[06:00:07] <johnjaye> er ./configure
[06:00:25] <johnjaye> there's like a compile option to omit *all* the external libraries and build a minimal emacs but i forgot what it is.

[06:06:34] <jtgd> ok there is an emacs-git package that say master branch

[06:30:40] <johnjaye> i thought it was community software like contrib on debian

[06:31:42] <AeroNotix> twb: the first step is admitting it

[06:32:35] <johnjaye> yes
[06:32:39] <johnjaye> it feels very cozy
[06:32:49] <bpalmer> one of the more obvious things to look at is gentoo's portage
[06:32:50] <johnjaye> having the scripts that fetch and build the source feels almost like having the source itself
[06:32:52] <twb> johnjaye: up until you have a security issue

[06:33:40] <twb> johnjaye: if you want to build things from source you can always do that

[06:34:21] <twb> When I last fought FreeBSD, you didn't have to do that horrible bullshit
[06:34:37] <johnjaye> in bsd it's all in one tree i gather since as you say it's all one cvs repo
[06:34:42] <twb> If you wanted mg you just did "pkg add mg" and it would download a pre-compiled binary
[06:34:53] <johnjaye> whereas the apt source thing you'd have to do for packages manually i guess?
[06:34:55] <twb> johnjaye: only the supported software is
[06:35:05] <johnjaye> like if package A depends on B if you do apt source A would ti also get and build B?
[06:35:18] <twb> johnjaye: anything unsupported -- like emacs or nginx or postgres or postfix or gnome -- is unsupported so is not maintained at all
[06:35:48] <twb> johnjaye: I'm not sure what your goal is here?  To needlessly recompile things?
[06:36:37] <johnjaye> if i compile a port on bsd it compiles everything that port depends on
[06:36:48] <jtgd> the main arch repo is vetted and blessed by Arch. The AUR is user contributions so I guess it's a trust issue.
[06:36:58] <johnjaye> so i asked if debian does the same. i dont' believe so. apt source just gets the source for that one thing

[08:41:43] <zebrag> hi
[08:43:00] <zebrag> no, the thing is, when searching through https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html, org-mode is adding every file it searches in the list of opened buffers
[08:43:10] *** Joins: mon_aaraj (~MonAaraj@user/mon-aaraj/x-4416475)

[08:44:42] <zebrag> So after doing that `C-x b` is suggesting (completion) every possible org files
[08:44:58] <zebrag> C-x C-b is listing every files in you directory
[08:45:01] <bpalmer> Ah, I see.
[08:45:44] <bpalmer> incidentally,  I will recommend ibuffer as a replacement for the C-x C-b binding over the default, on the chance I had not previously recommended it.
[08:49:01] <corwin> incal: indeed. `make-temp-file' and `make-nearby-temp-file' are quite handy also

[09:24:19] <kitty1> Yo! #org-mode wasn't able to help me, so was wondering if anyone knows either how to help or where to even ask. I have been trying to get Scheme code to run with org-babel but unlike elisp which works perfectly fine there is nothing being displayed in the #+RESULTS block, and in *Messages* buffer there is;   Guile REPL up and running!   ;   Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 315) signaled
[09:24:21] <kitty1> (wrong-type-argument markerp nil) ; Code block evaluation complete.   ; That one error is the only thing I can gather being wrong anywhere apart from the results field being empty when it generates. Not 100% sure if this is emacs, org-babel, or geiser tbh

[12:44:40] <bkhl> Rocky as a project seems to be more like going back to the Centos project as it was before Red Hat took it on.
[12:45:11] <thomasb06> rather aiming at assuring a continuity then. What was CentOs before?
[12:48:11] <bkhl> It started as an independent project that rebuilt Red Hat based on the sources released by Red Hat, without the branding

[12:50:18] <thomasb06> high availability, at hardware level?
[12:50:20] <bkhl> That means maybe applying patches that aren't in RHEL yet aimed at stability.
[12:50:36] <thomasb06> ok
[12:50:53] <bkhl> But, the distinction is kind of a hairswidth, since both also aim for binary compatibility with the matching RHEL version.

[18:54:27] <rpav> _maybe_ the elisp debugger would let you trace everything that happens, but i'm not sure
[18:55:06] <rpav> possibly .. https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Timers.html
[18:55:25] <rpav> looks like there is a `list-timers` .. you can also look up the standard hooks and at least poke through those
[18:55:45] <AbhaySaxena[m]> Sweet. Thank you.
[18:56:17] <rpav> hooks run have to start wtih the standard ones at _some_ point i think .. but, there may be other avenues for running code, emacs/elisp is big ;/
[18:56:25] <bpalmer> note that timers are not bound to a specific buffer; they're global freestanding bits of code.
[18:57:21] <bpalmer> there are also a handful of uncommonly used things that would need to be investigated, like M-x list-threads RET

[19:09:20] <AbhaySaxena[m]> If I add a "#+Title: blah" line, then I can C-c C-c that line to make org-mode restart, in which case everything will render correctly for a tenth, then the extra star appears again.

[19:31:10] <deviantfero> yeah I guess things have been slowly improving over the times
[19:31:12] <crazazy> and also LSP is very much based on the assumption that you have set up a proper project

[23:06:45] <wasamasa> my socat-fu isn't strong enough to outsource the task to an existing XMODEM implementation
[23:06:59] <wasamasa> so I wrote a bit of ruby code to implement XMODEM myself
[23:07:05] <wasamasa> it's such a hack
[23:07:19] <lampilelo> socat-fu ;)
[23:07:23] <wasamasa> you can implement it in like, 20 lines of code
[23:07:33] <wasamasa> or maybe 100 lines if you're writing assembly

[23:07:55] <wasamasa> it allows transmitting binary data slowly
[23:08:01] <wasamasa> in 128 byte blocks
[23:08:09] <wasamasa> there is rudimentary error correction
[23:08:26] <wasamasa> the last block is padded with SUB
[23:08:27] <rpav> 7-bit recoding with CRC or something?
[23:08:34] <wasamasa> lol
[23:08:58] <wasamasa> it's a very stupid checksum adding all the bytes of the block and appending the result mod 256

[23:09:12] <wasamasa> this doesn't actually work on fucked up transmission links
[23:10:11] <wasamasa> I spent like 30 minutes wondering what the sending program is waiting for
[23:10:15] <technomancy> haha wild
[23:10:22] <technomancy> so you're gonna use record separators and stuff?
[23:10:29] <wasamasa> then I discovered it's giving you up to 90s of waiting time until you send a NAK to initiate transmission
[23:10:29] <rpav> ok close but no 7-bit data, weird

[23:11:10] <wasamasa> yeah
[23:11:20] <wasamasa> there's a whole family of stupid and slightly less stupid modem protocols

[23:13:10] <wasamasa> there's a lot of protocol extensions naturally
