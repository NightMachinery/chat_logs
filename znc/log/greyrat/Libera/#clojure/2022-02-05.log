[00:45:57] <Para> Frozenlock: seeing how one tackles such a problem tells a lot more about the person and the way they solve their skills than expecting a specific answer
[00:46:30] <Para> It's not a complex task either; shows how well you understand the basics and can reason with an abstract problem to solve.
[00:48:26] <ggb> Sometimes such a problem can be useful for testing domain knowledge as well. "How would you ..." without needing a full solution. Steve Yegge gave a good example of finding all the web pages (in a large directory structure) that have a phone number.
[00:49:24] <ggb> If the answer *isn't*, "Somethign something grep," then there's an issue (for certain roles).
[00:49:42] <ggb> I put the "parse ls output" in the same category.
[00:50:25] <Para> We rarely even looked at the resulting code, to be honest :)
[00:50:34] <ggb> It's, "Are you aware of the tools available and can you match them to categories of problems?" more than, "Write me some perfect code, monkey!"
[00:50:36] <Para> It was a character test, mostly.
[00:51:19] <Para> And that, yeah.
[00:51:35] <Para> It is quite amazing how differently people react to such tests.
[00:52:31] <ggb> It, unfortunately, is also a meta-test of, "Can you figure out what the purpose of this question is and answer in a way that demonstrates this understanding, and also answers the question?"
[00:52:50] <Para> I personally don't like making people do such things, but sometimes they do feel necessary; although mostly for bookkeeping, I predicted every failure we had, it's just a good box to tick for the HR why we're not recommending moving onwards with a person.
[00:53:16] <ggb> I've found that even if you preface the questions and explain their purpose, some people still freeze up and think it's "Write some perfect code for me!"
[00:53:30] <ggb> Interviewing is hard on both sides.
[00:54:02] <Para> Yeah, indeed it is.

[03:37:40] <sobel> it was interesting, some combinatorics where short patterns were easy to verify but longer patterns could only be assured to a degree and the memory-or-cpu cost grew quickly

[06:57:32] <sobel> we had a little bit of unhealthy app/database rivalry, from doofuses on the app side who just hated the database and the premise of a whole other realm of concurrency and constraints that were not only outside his purview but expertise

[07:18:57] <sobel> true, but it sure puts a kink in public training experiments!
[07:19:04] <kakuhen> but yes the issue with training on human data is that your model may learn some of the worst human biases
[07:20:07] <ggb> You know what they say, one bad apple spoils the bunch.
[07:20:34] <ggb> There's a bootstrapping problem on identifying acceptable content to use for training.

[18:14:59] <selfsymmetric-mu> Frozenlock: Cool, yeah. That's what I'm banking on. Especially since they also do quarterly OKRs, so you're attempting to emulate a quarterly system with a biweekly system.

[18:16:24] <sobel> i've had the unusual agile experience. small team, we favored hygiene in code, design, and personal interactions. if someone *felt* frustrated we'd cut the tempo in half to have a design refresh.

[18:20:17] <selfsymmetric-mu> I do not know how it got there.
[18:20:33] <ridcully_> often they rose from their own ranks.  so putts law in full effect

[18:22:06] <selfsymmetric-mu> My preferred setup: Have a page that describes what our team is going to accomplish, and by when. If I'm the lead then it's my job to start with good estimates, and then deliver on those estimates.

[18:22:35] <selfsymmetric-mu> Making estimates and keeping them requires good project strategy. Domain knowledge, experience, fallbacks.
[18:22:48] <sobel> at some point i figured out what my less-experienced peers would not prioritize, and i provided those things like a platform to the team. now that's pretty much my practice, whether the team is devs or ops or my sales team selling reports.
[18:23:18] <selfsymmetric-mu> sobel: That's a great skill!
[18:23:46] <selfsymmetric-mu> Also, I reject reductionism in estimation. The trick is estimating the impact of what you DIDN'T think of. Another reason I don't like story points.
[18:23:58] <selfsymmetric-mu> Estimations don't add. They breed.
[18:24:04] <sobel> i wish i had better skill at time estimates. there's a tiny scope in which i can accurately estimate schedule but it's way too easy for stuff to exceed that scope in real feature dev scenarios.
[18:24:20] <sobel> > They breed.
[18:24:23] <sobel> raaar!!
[18:24:27] <sobel> so true
[18:25:28] <selfsymmetric-mu> Any estimation is about finding the right data that matches specificity with magnitude. 
[18:25:30] <sobel> during quarantine i just let my useless free time go to covering my underestimates/overexpectations for a while and i figured something out: i was crushing it but had bitten off a ton of work
[18:26:07] <selfsymmetric-mu> If you wanted to predict your blood pressure in a year, you could look at the average bp of all humans, of all humans your age, of all humans in your profession, etc. etc.
[18:26:19] <selfsymmetric-mu> The more specific it gets, the smaller the sample size.
[18:26:45] <selfsymmetric-mu> But at no point are you attempting to simulate your cardiovascular system in your head, adding up each individual impact, to try to get your blood pressure as a sum.
[18:26:55] <sobel> my professional landscape includes some crazy unknowns from a legacy system under assault from chrome's ongoing attempts to secure the web
[18:27:16] <selfsymmetric-mu> sobel: Oh no! You're a knight in the face of the onslaught.
[18:27:40] <selfsymmetric-mu> ...shame the story doesn't win too many ears at a bar, but that's why there's IRC.
[18:28:21] <sobel> i give it a year, maybe two, before it's just hosed. last year i ran out of timebox to fix what should have been simple, and what IS simple if i'm just packaging a nominally interesting sql query to REST
[18:28:48] <sobel> but stuff is just breaking right and left for what i can only conclude are ongoing tiny JS/DOM changes

[18:50:46] <sobel> one of those codebases where you can't fix a bug without creating 10-100 more

[18:51:57] <ridcully_> legacy, as in "no tests"?
[18:53:52] <sobel> tests might imply some separability of the bits of code
[18:54:32] <sobel> the entrypoint is JS generated by PHP with just a small amount of database data interpolated. the code quality goes strictly downhill from there.
[18:56:23] <sobel> my favorite is a structure where some PHP hits a java web service for some JSON containing an array of interest. that array is converted to xml for the wire. receiving PHP nests it with some other xml and sends it to JS, where an decode function makes: JS arrays.
[18:57:04] <sobel> i should say, "xml" not xml. let's not pretend anything is standardized in this heap. it's merely close.
[18:59:27] <sobel> the database is a real piece of work. i prepare EVERY query because the report date is baked into the table name instead of a date column, and it's an important selector in every application query.
[19:00:51] <sobel> so yeah, no tests
[19:01:35] <sobel> we estimated 4 man-weeks just to analyze and remove unused files and unreachable code. and it was far from risk-free.
[19:08:48] <Frozenlock> *shivers*
[19:13:39] <shem> it's been a while since i validated xml against a schema
[19:17:47] <selfsymmetric-mu> But have you validated "xml" against an "idea"?
[19:19:18] <sobel> well, this "xml" not only won't validate but won't parse with an xml-compatible parser
[19:19:21] <sobel> it's just broken tag soup
[19:19:53] <sobel> i was like, why? then i saw the parser in play, and it basically doesn't care about the usual trappings of why we bother with xml in the first place (when we do)
[19:20:16] <sobel> it's criminal. i refer to the perpetrators of this mess as the previous arsonists.
[19:20:55] <sobel> i come from a peculiar perspective in discussions about certifying software developers
