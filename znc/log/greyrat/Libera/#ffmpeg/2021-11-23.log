[00:12:26] <emcodem> https://www.mail-archive.com/ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org/msg124998.html
[00:14:55] <emcodem> maybe it works when you install 4.3 as system ffmpeg?
[00:15:55] <JEEB> even 4.4
[00:16:04] <JEEB> since that change is only in master
[00:16:12] <JEEB> a lot of private symbol cleanup was there

[00:59:49] <LorenDB[m]> YaST says I'm running 4.4.1-1.1, so I don't know how that is a wrong version
[01:01:48] <JEEB> then opera is loading up some other dynamic library
[01:02:00] <JEEB> if it's a link-time dep check the output of lld
[01:02:07] <JEEB> if it's a runtime thing, you'll have to trace it
[01:02:13] <LorenDB[m]> wut
[01:02:44] <LorenDB[m]> I just downgraded chromium-ffmpeg-extra from 93.something to 61.something (switched package vendor) and it fixed the problem
[01:02:44] <emcodem> hehe does yast say when your 4.4.1 version was released?
[01:02:53] <LorenDB[m]> ðŸŽ‰
[01:02:58] <LorenDB[m]> emcodem: Lemme check
[01:03:09] <JEEB> LorenDB[m]: yea as I said - it was a thing from FFmpeg but it's the chromium thingamajig
[01:03:27] <JEEB> and your opera was expecting symbols not in whatever you switched to
[01:03:35] <JEEB> lld or tracing would have shown where it tries to load that symbol
[01:03:38] <emcodem> yeah exactly, just perfect... the hassle would have been to find out which ffmpeg distro opera is linking to but you just found out!
[01:03:42] <LorenDB[m]> emcodem: no. Build Oct. 31 though, if that helps
[01:04:05] * LorenDB[m] must remember to not upgrade chromium-ffmpeg-extra ever again
[01:04:15] <emcodem> yeah that would be a too new release
[01:04:16] <LorenDB[m]> Anyway, thanks for your help!

[20:16:49] <qwedfg> what would be optimal frequency on audio output from pc?
[20:16:53] <qwedfg> I have ALC892 in that PC
[20:17:08] <qwedfg> and I dont think it really support 44.1, 48, 96 and 192
[20:17:16] <qwedfg> I think it may only support 48
[20:17:30] <qwedfg> so I think it should properly resample in software to 48 first and play 48
[20:17:37] <qwedfg> am I right, is this the case?
[20:17:50] <qwedfg> just like opus does on th ecodec level, and that makes sense
[20:19:16] <galad> ALC892 specs say it supports up to 192, what makes you think it does not?

[20:24:40] <kepstin> a single choice of sample rate usually results from an os-level mixer running that combines the output from multiple applications.
[20:25:10] <kepstin> if possible you'd want to match whatever sample rate that mixer is running at, but they usually include a resampler ability so it's not that critical.

[21:10:26] <Tamburino76> Hi all, is vp9 with opus in matroska mkv container a good open source solution for videos?
[21:11:04] <JEEB> I think you mean something else with the wording "open source"
[21:11:32] <Tamburino76> i thought it is open source, but then maybe license free?
[21:11:39] <JEEB> since x264 f.ex. is 100% open source, libre and all that stuff. as well as performant as hell. yet you didn't pick that :)
[21:12:27] <Tamburino76> well if i install ffmpeg in my distrbution i don't see x264 avaiable in codecs :O
[21:12:41] <JEEB> even ubuntu I think now by default installs it?
[21:12:59] <JEEB> only I think US based stuff keeps away from anything that maybe has software patents around it
[21:13:03] <JEEB> like red hat
[21:13:07] <JEEB> possibly suse
[21:13:10] <JEEB> in other words, corporate entities
[21:13:26] <BtbN> VP9 has no good encoder, so it's of limited use
[21:13:39] <JEEB> ubuntu used to split libavcodec into two packages
[21:13:44] <JEEB> but I think they stopped that practice
[21:13:49] <JEEB> not sure if that is also a change in upstream
[21:14:04] <JEEB> (upstream = debian)
[21:14:24] <Tamburino76> okay then what is the best codec for my videos? x264 then? x265?
[21:14:35] <BtbN> Define best
[21:15:13] <Tamburino76> best in quality, decode/encode performance, compression
[21:15:24] <BtbN> You got to pick one of those
[21:15:31] <kepstin> so, which of those things?
[21:15:53] <DHE> x264 (h264) will have the widest support of players. x265 has better ratio, but more difficult CPU work and licensing for h265 is a bit worse than h264 if that's a concern to you
[21:16:04] *** Joins: dreamon (~dreamon@pd9503f0b.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[21:16:07] <JEEB> and yea I recalled correctly https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libavcodec58
[21:16:15] <kepstin> in general, to get better compression, you get worse decode/encode performance
[21:16:16] <JEEB> normal libavcodec has x264 nowadays
[21:16:19] <JEEB> let's see debian
[21:16:42] <kepstin> (and quality is a setting you control, so is more or less independent of codec choice)
[21:16:50] <DHE> last I tried debian it did have libx264 with ffmpeg
[21:16:55] <JEEB> yea debian does the same thing https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libavcodec58
[21:17:01] <JEEB> so it came from debian
[21:18:03] <JEEB> anyways, most compatibility, a pretty darn good, performant encoder - that's H.264. and x264 is the encoder :) put that into mp4 and browsers will eat it up too (esp. when mixed with AAC or opus audio)
[21:18:43] <Tamburino76> but h.264 isn't license free
[21:18:56] <JEEB> are you distributing a video encoder or decoder?
[21:19:16] <JEEB> also license free is something you ask from a lawyer anyways
[21:19:43] <JEEB> if you want to play with libvpx and vp9, that a thing, but libvpx is an "unfortunate case". even if the format is technically better than H.264 most likely, the encoder is really limited due to Google's lack of ambition
[21:19:49] <JEEB> vp9 also goes into mp4 just fine
[21:19:51] <DHE> you mean patent free?
[21:19:55] <Tamburino76> no, the distribution is only shipped with license free video codecs, and all other codecs are installed with another repository source and i don't want this
[21:20:08] <kepstin> all video codecs have licenses
[21:20:14] <kepstin> libx264 is gpl, for example
[21:20:19] <JEEB> he means patent stuff most likely
[21:20:24] <JEEB> is that fedora/red hat or suse?
[21:20:26] <Tamburino76> sorry then i mean patent free
[21:20:27] <kepstin> which is usually considered a "free software license", fwiw
[21:20:27] <Tamburino76> suse
[21:20:28] *** Joins: MrNobody (~captain@27.ip-37-187-211.eu)
[21:20:38] <BtbN> Every video codec in existence is patented
[21:20:42] <BtbN> including VP9
[21:20:48] <BtbN> Google just pledged to not charge royalties
[21:20:50] <JEEB> anyways at this point it's "not available in his binaries"
[21:20:51] <DHE> yeah... I mean technically vp9 isn't patent-free either. it's just the world gets a free license to use it or something like htat
[21:20:55] <MrNobody> Has anyone had trouble with ffmpeg -i filename-with-hyphen-in-it.m4a ?
[21:21:01] <BtbN> no
[21:21:23] <JEEB> Tamburino76: anyways VP9 in mp4 will work if that's all you have. but be warned about the crappiness of libvpx
[21:21:24] <kepstin> Tamburino76: if you can't use mpeg codecs, vp9 is probably the best option available
[21:21:42] <DHE> MrNobody: what about a :colon: ?
[21:21:58] <BtbN> You HAVE to do two-pass encoding for libvpx to be useful at all
[21:22:01] <BtbN> it's really terrible
[21:22:11] <JEEB> I don't think the results with `-crf 30 -cpu-used 1 -deadline good` were too bad
[21:22:24] <BtbN> That sounds like it'll be dirt slow :D
[21:22:25] <JEEB> but yes, some features are for some stupid reason only available with 2pass
[21:22:27] <Tamburino76> my question was exactly this, what is the best codec if i only want to use the codecs that are called "patent free" and shipped with distributions that take care of this stuff
[21:22:38] <MrNobody> DHE: I don't  know what to do. Normally touch -- file-a.txt && rm -- file-a.txt works. Using -- is the way to end command arguments and have a file with an - in it. But with ffmpeg the -i has to come before the arguments so I'm stuck !
[21:22:39] <BtbN> mpeg2 I guess? That should be patent free by now
[21:23:07] <JEEB> Tamburino76: AV1 through some encoder is the newest format right now? the encoders are a bit raw in various places tho
[21:23:15] <DHE> MrNobody: ffmpeg doesn't follow that rule. it doesn't take a list of files the way `rm` and such do. order and position of args matters
[21:23:19] <BtbN> Even AV1 has patents, just the same royalty-free deal
[21:23:20] <MrNobody> ogg ogv are patent free right?
[21:23:31] <BtbN> no, also just royalty-free
[21:23:32] <DHE> theora?
[21:23:40] <MrNobody> yeah theora
[21:23:43] <JEEB> well if it's over 20 years old you can argue it's really patent free :P
[21:23:51] <JEEB> since US litigation is 20 years for patents
[21:23:54] <DHE> ya was going to say it's really old...
[21:24:07] <Tamburino76> JEEB: why do you say libvpx is crappiness? any reasons?
[21:24:25] <JEEB> Tamburino76: it's a google-only affair and the stuff like limiting features for no real reason to 2pass encoding
[21:24:37] <JEEB> when only one vendor cares about an encoder, that never leads to good
[21:24:39] <MrNobody> DHE: ffmpeg -i "filename with spaces -option.m4a" # that's not a problem?
[21:24:46] <BtbN> It's just not a good encoder. It's slow, poor quality, obscure ways to make it be not quite as crap
[21:24:49] <JEEB> x264 was good especially because you had multiple young hackers behind it :P
[21:25:02] <JEEB> who did what they cared about
[21:25:19] <JEEB> (and sometimes what their $dayjob required as they got to that point)
[21:25:27] <DHE> MrNobody: that's fine, as long as the quotes are handled properly
[21:25:54] <DHE> I'd be more concerned with a :colon: since ffmpeg can accept URLs as "filenames"
[21:28:13] <MrNobody> Something has gone very wrong with my script to convert multiple files in to mp3 format
[21:28:26] <Tamburino76> hm.. i got the same performance with the same quality if i convert a video with h.264 or vp9
[21:28:42] <BtbN> define "same quality"
[21:28:49] <Tamburino76> and it looks like vp9 has also hardware acceleration for amd gpu
[21:28:59] <BtbN> libvpx has no such thing
[21:29:26] <MrNobody> Is vp9 google's version of h264?
[21:29:42] <BtbN> it's somewhere between h264 and h265
[21:29:49] <Tamburino76> then why amdgpu for linux has hardware acceleration for vp9?
[21:29:50] <DHE> MrNobody: did you put quotes around your "$filename" in the commandline whenever you use it?
[21:29:58] <MrNobody> yeah I did
[21:30:13] <BtbN> You use that via vaapi, if it's exposed and supported
[21:30:20] <BtbN> libvpx is a pure software encoder, just like x264
[21:30:25] <MrNobody> It appears that ffmpeg is somehow parsing the argument to -i. more testing in progress.
[21:30:51] <Tamburino76> okay than with vaapi
[21:31:37] <BtbN> Good luck getting it to work :D
[21:31:57] <Tamburino76> why? is it complicated?
[21:32:14] <BtbN> h264 and maybe hevc vaapi hwenc is somewhat well tested and implemented now
[21:32:18] <BtbN> everything else... not so much
[21:32:36] <BtbN> And hardware encoders are also generally bad. They're good at going very fast, that's about it.
[21:32:47] <BtbN> And/Or not bothering the CPU while doing their thing
[21:33:15] <Tamburino76> ah okay
[21:33:49] <Tamburino76> i have read that speed for convert a video is 10-20x faster with vaapi compared to cpu
[21:34:01] <BtbN> If all you care about is quality with not completely ridiculous encoding speeds, libx264/5 is where it's at,
[21:34:41] <MrNobody> How about creating a cryptocoin that uses media encoding as proof of work?
[21:34:53] <BtbN> How about no?
[21:35:12] <MrNobody> Well I guess not then
[21:35:33] <realies> can ffmpeg be used to do eq matching from one audio track to another?
[21:39:12] <Tamburino76> BtbN but for videos i encode for the internet with 1M bitrate vp9 should be enough good right?
[21:41:23] <BtbN> 1M bitrate is very little. For 480 or ultra low compexity 720p, maybe
[21:41:34] <BtbN> *480p

[21:57:28] <Tamburino76> but opus is a good audocodec? no one said anything against it before ;-)
[21:58:05] <kepstin> opus is great. no reason to use anything else unless you want lossless encoding.
[21:58:20] <kepstin> (assuming your player supports it, of course)
[21:58:47] <Tamburino76> thanks
[21:58:54] <JEEB> and it can be utilized in mp4, just like vp9
[21:59:23] <Tamburino76> is there any reason to not use mkv? i tought container doesn't matter much
[21:59:36] <JEEB> it doesn't matter too much, but plain matroska won't open in browsers
[21:59:42] <JEEB> while mp4 does
[21:59:50] <JEEB> also mp4 does timestamps somewhat better

[21:59:57] <Tamburino76> ah okay, thanks for this info
[21:59:58] <kepstin> depends on what your player can support. if you want it to work in a browser you need either mp4 or webm (which is technically an mkv profile)
[22:00:58] <Tamburino76> good to know!
[22:00:59] <JEEB> I think the primary gain from matroska in that case would be subtitle format support
[22:03:11] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:04:25] <Tamburino76> then is opus also good for my musik songs and not only for video audio?
[22:04:32] <another|> AFAIK AOM is working on finalizing opus-in-mp4
[22:04:46] <Tamburino76> flac for archiving and opus for sharing?
[22:04:52] <BtbN> If you already have encoded files, there is practically no reason to re-encode, ever.
[22:05:03] <BtbN> Quality will only ever get worse
[22:08:53] <kepstin> if your originals are lossless (cd audio, flac) and you want smaller files for mobile device or sharing or whatever, then opus is a good choice.
[22:09:02] <kepstin> but don't re-encode other lossy formats (mp3, aac) to opus

[22:17:40] <MrNobody> OHHH DHE does ffmpeg read from stdin
[22:17:58] <MrNobody> The list of files to convert is piped in to stdin for my script
[22:17:59] <another|> if you tell it to
[22:18:26] <MrNobody> It was printing out errors for filenames which are later down the list of files which totally confused me
[22:18:27] <another|> no. no file list via stdin
[22:18:48] <DHE> using concat as the input?
[22:19:21] <MrNobody> while read CMD # is the part of my bash script that does it
[22:20:12] <MrNobody> It takes a list of files, one per line, and processes them
[22:20:35] <MrNobody> I need to try with -nostdin!
[22:20:51] <kepstin> ffmpeg will attempt to read commands from stdin in some cases, yeah. use the "-nostdin" flag to turn that off.
[22:21:18] <MrNobody> well than fixed it!
[22:21:49] <MrNobody> I'm now going to find out how many 8kbps 8000hz audio files can fit on a CD!
[22:22:07] <MrNobody> That's 1 bit per every sample

[22:36:41] <furq> opus should be better than speex at any rate

[22:58:41] <linext__> i need some help identifying similar frames in a stream, for when my Verizon set-top box isn't showing a channel
[22:59:19] <linext__> https://ibb.co/album/kmxWdS
[22:59:36] <linext__> the verizon logo moves around the screen as does the date/time and instructions
[23:00:06] <linext__> it's all hooked up to a DVR and IR remote over Wifi repeater
[23:00:33] <linext__> basically detecting if certain features are present in the Verizon logo frame
[23:01:42] <linext__> once in a while the Verizon box loses it's signal and needs a reboot.  i added a relay to the box which can reset the power supply
[23:01:57] <linext__> when it wakes up, it doesn't jump right to the prev channel
