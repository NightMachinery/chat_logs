[01:06:16] <Grinnz> mst: amazing
[01:06:42] <Grinnz> and yeah, needing to build for the target is necessary for any case of this
[01:06:49] <mst> huf: that'd basically be App::staticperl but de-schmorped
[01:06:50] <LeoNerd> Also, there's interesting scenarios even within one machine... e.g. inside a -really- restricted sandbox
[01:07:05] <LeoNerd> You can pass pureperl modules around and now, xs too :)
[01:07:14] <Grinnz> the only way to ship something portable is essentially shipping a carton bundle and having a build toolchain on the target

[01:08:26] <Grinnz> ideally, xs modules don't depend on shared libraries
[01:08:36] <Grinnz> well, aside from package managed
[01:08:37] <mst> LeoNerd: so far, "I don't" ... I picked this demo because DBD::SQLite by default builds without such a dependency

[01:08:57] <LeoNerd> Iseeee
[01:09:09] <Grinnz> cause that also breaks "moving the installed module"
[01:09:12] <mst> I think the way to handle that will be to pre-compute the .so dependencies and have it bundle them with an order to dlopen them
[01:09:17] <LeoNerd> Still, I suspect that's a relatively (to this) simple case of just hunting them down beforehand
[01:09:19] <LeoNerd> yah
[01:09:21] <vanfanel64> mst, in my experience, many places can have a mix of machines, depending on how far appart or what budgets look like
[01:09:42] <mst> vanfanel64: and those places will be better served by finding pure perl deps and just using FatPacker, yes
[01:09:43] <vanfanel64> It would sure be nice if machiens were always the same
[01:10:04] <Grinnz> vanfanel64: those places can use a carton bundle and need a build toolchain per target type anyway
[01:10:32] <mst> vanfanel64: but "how is this useful for the people with environments it isn't useful for" is not an interesting question to me ;)
[01:11:29] <mst> and for e.g. a set of systems on the same debian stable or ubuntu LTS version, it should work out just fine

[01:18:57] <mst> though admittedly I'd done some research previously, I actually upgraded my freebsd box to get it to a kernel version that has memfd_create for when I got around to this
[01:19:02] <ilmari> LeoNerd: your heap runneth over?
[01:19:41] <mst> vanfanel64: oh, *also*, there's no reason you can't bundle the .so data for multiple perls with a bit of trickery
[01:19:57] <jabberwok> trip down memory lane: that memfd code got me thinking of ancient project and i tracked down the code; the largest part of that DLL, written entirely in MSC (not C++ even), converted a DXF file to Windows Metafile (.wmf) format. It was the only way to make VB work non-glacially on a 40MHz machine. And that was the project that got me to swear off MS forever and switch to Perl. Circle complete.

[01:20:19] <leont> mst: since when is freebsd copying Linux'  special filehandles?
[01:20:50] <mst> leont: apparently they decided memfd_create was worth stealing, I know nothing beyond that
[01:21:03] <mst> under the circumstances, I wasn't going to argue though :D

[01:22:00] <leont> timerfd and signalfd are much more interesting, and eventfd has its moments. memfd wouldn't be my first pick
[01:22:33] <LeoNerd> Wait, why did they call it memfd, and not antimmap() ?
[01:22:47] <LeoNerd> it's just an mmap backwards
[01:23:49] <leont> Also, pidfd is a great idea

[01:25:36] <mst> leont: and then I can just use ... no, wait

[11:16:10] <depesz> LeoNerd: i looked at your module (5 minute look, not deep). Looks like the code is basically in 2 places: TermKey.pm (only 1 method), and in .xs. the xs looks like C. Does it have to be written by hand, or a tool like h2xs will do it?
[11:16:24] <depesz> LeoNerd: my worry is that while I can write some, working, perl, my C skills are virtually none.
[11:16:55] <xenu> h2xs will make a working skeleton, if a function is defined inside .xs file usually there's no need to write anything in the .pm file
[11:17:12] <xenu> apart maybe for Exporter stuff

[18:33:45] <Altreus> These days, an SQL query that runs functions that have side-effects can probably be in the "disciplinary action" category
[18:34:25] <bigpresh> Particularly a SELECT, at least.
[18:34:29] <El_Che> Altreus: I have seen many selects that retrieve info and write a timestamp when (e.g. network logins)

[18:34:52] <El_Che> a "last seen" functionality
[18:35:31] <bigpresh> That's something I'd implement application-side, because a SELECT query causing updates is just Wrong.
[18:36:35] <El_Che> I don't do it, but I get it
[18:36:50] <El_Che> the closed you are to devices, you difficult it is to implement extra functionality
[18:37:10] <El_Che> (I replaced all that stuff by API calls)
[18:40:12] <Altreus> That sounds like the right answer
[18:40:29] <El_Che> wow
[18:40:33] <Altreus> it also seems to me that if you're that close to the device, you're probably not going to be running that query on a beefy readonly replicant
[18:40:35] <El_Che> I read my own sentence
[18:40:46] <El_Che> I will stop multitasking to finish some stuff :P
[18:40:55] <El_Che> your eyes can thank me later
