[02:04:40] <drakonis> perhaps
[02:05:06] <bsandro> broodwar too

[02:05:21] <drakonis> idk
[02:05:22] <ngoldbaum> total annihalation
[02:05:26] <drakonis> broodwar was an accident
[02:05:26] <technomancy> the true golden age of PC games was when people had such low standards that they would play all the way thru Sierra adventure games even though they made no goddamn sense because what else were you going to do
[02:05:41] <ngoldbaum> buy lucasarts games?
[02:05:48] <drakonis> because blizzard does not have the chops to repeat brood war

[02:08:41] <drakonis> descent is good shit
[02:09:49] <ngoldbaum> did you ever play spaceward ho! ?
[02:09:51] <technomancy> everyone was like "wow quake is amazing how they do real actual full 3D; totally unprecedented gameplay" meanwhile descent has been out for a while and is at least 3x as fun
[02:09:59] <companion_cube> I played ground control back then ♥
[02:10:04] <companion_cube> (talking about Sierra :p)
[02:10:04] <ngoldbaum> i played the shit out of that
[02:10:10] <ngoldbaum> speaking of old mac games
[02:10:16] <technomancy> ngoldbaum: rings a bell but IIRC I could never figure out how it worked
[02:10:43] <ngoldbaum> there was another mac game where you designed your own 2D spaceships
[02:11:24] <technomancy> reading the Descent wikipedia page I have to say "indoor flight simulator" is a genre that sounds a lot weirder than it looks

[02:13:11] <technomancy> ngoldbaum: oh yeah I played the hell out of that. had a great modding scene too.

[19:04:13] <rb> has anyone ever had to deal with a complete database schema revamp? how did it go? how do you sync data between the old and new schema while in the transitional period?
[19:04:45] <rb> i'm asking because we're gonna have to do it :^(
[19:05:48] <wrl> rb: can you migrate from the old to the new db on-demand?
[19:06:00] <rb> wdym?
[19:06:36] <wrl> i.e. if you have users logging in, can you pull their records from the old db and insert them into the new db when they login?
[19:06:39] <wrl> maybe that's too complicated
[19:07:01] <rb> oh no it's not too complicated
[19:07:06] <rb> i had something like that in mind too
[19:07:17] <rb> add a hook to also insert stuff to the new DB on the API side
[19:07:26] <wrl> imo your absolute worst state would be continuing to r/w to both the new and the old simultaneously
[19:07:29] <jj5> rb: you can't just take the old system offline the pull its data into the new db?
[19:07:38] <rb> ideally zero downtime
[19:07:43] <wrl> imo getting to new-readwrite and old-readonly asap is your priority
[19:07:44] <jj5> because if you did that you could test the migration script first...
[19:07:52] <rb> wrl: hmmm interesting point
[19:08:31] <rb> i think what we can do is take a production backup and restore it to an off-site mysql instance, and then test the migration script on it
[19:08:36] <wrl> yeah
[19:08:51] <wrl> having to maintain both new and old as readwrite is how you end up with technical debt
[19:08:53] <jj5> if the migration runs fast enough you could just schedule some downtime
[19:08:57] <wrl> yeah
[19:09:25] <rb> wrl: hmm true, could do something like that
[19:09:36] <rb> this is still like a month away, we still need to decide on the database schema
[19:09:53] <wrl> if it's a month away and you still haven't finalised the new schema then it's not a month away
[19:09:53] <rb> filtering products by "in stock" status takes 90 seconds with the current schema T_T
[19:09:56] <wrl> lmao
[19:10:22] <rb> wrl: well we've got until end of january to get this in working order
[19:10:43] <jj5> it's an interesting problem how to do performant status modeling
[19:11:01] <jj5> I like having a table for each state and moving records between tables when states change
[19:11:41] <jj5> so e.g. a product_in_stock table and a product_out_of_stock table...
[19:12:02] <rb> hmm that's not too bad,  searching across all products could be a problem then though...
[19:12:14] <jj5> you can create a union view...
[19:12:21] <rb> good point
[19:13:10] <rb> but a problem would be moving stuff in bulk between tables. i guess a INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... FROM could help
[19:13:24] <rb> because we have a bunch of suppliers which we automatically fetch data from and update stock status
[19:13:48] <jj5> yeah there are various options and they come with tradeoffs...
[19:14:01] <rb> i wonder if a regular index would help with that?
[19:14:15] <jj5> the problem is the selectivity of an index on a status column can be shit so it just table scans...
[19:14:46] <jj5> you would definitely still have indexes on your state tables
[19:14:49] <river> why the hell is copy Ctrl-c but copy in terminal is Ctrl-Shift-c
[19:15:01] <rb> river: because ^C is SIGINT
[19:15:11] <jj5> rb: because of Microsoft Windows :P
[19:15:13] <rb> jj5: oh yeah definitely
[19:15:30] <rb> it should be shift+Ins everywhere obviously
[19:15:48] <rb> (definitely was to having indexes)
[19:15:58] <technomancy[m]> copy in the terminal is *selects-with-mouse*
[19:16:10] <jj5> technomancy[m]: lol, so true
[19:17:05] <rb> but yeah i think the multiple tables thing is sound
[19:17:12] <rb> then we could just consolidate those with a union view, as you said
[19:17:25] <rb> and then queries where "in_stock = 1" become "from products_in_stock"
[19:17:36] <rb> thanks!
[19:17:37] <jj5> rb: yup, you got it
[19:19:29] <river> added debug prints, bug disappears
[19:19:31] <rb> hmm how do you handle the IDs of new items though
[19:19:48] <rb> they need to be unique across both tables, autoincrement won't save me there
[19:19:55] <jj5> rb: well you don't use auto_increment :)
[19:20:53] <jj5> yup you will need to get a unique ID from somewhere else... for my schema I have an 'internal_id' table which uses auto_increment IDs and I get all my IDs from there...
[19:21:10] <rb> yep, i just found this too https://www.percona.com/blog/2010/10/04/sharing-an-auto_increment-value-across-multiple-mysql-tables/
[19:21:11] <mockturtle> [ Sharing an auto_increment value across multiple MySQL tables - Percona Database Performance Blog ] - www.percona.com
[19:21:30] <rb> "just insert to a table, and grab the insert ID from that" is the idea apparently
[19:21:34] <jj5> oh yuck that doesn't sound like a good idea :P
[19:21:48] <rb> hm?
[19:21:54] <rb> isn't that what you described?
[19:23:24] <jj5> oh yes, sorry. I misunderstood.
[19:23:34] <jj5> so, yeah, have a table for allocating schema wide IDs
[19:24:36] <jj5> (you can share "schema wide" IDs between tables, but only when the primary key on a secondary table is a foreign key to a primary table)
[19:24:57] <jj5> there are three ways to create records in your internal_id table
[19:25:14] <jj5> 1. you just use an auto_increment ID and allocate one row per ID
[19:25:57] <jj5> 2. you use one row per 'range' and allocate $n records per row
[19:26:52] <jj5> 3. you keep one record with the name of the internal ID (e.g. "internal_id") and you select( max id ) where name = 'internal_id' and += $n
[19:27:22] <rb> hmm interesting options
[19:27:56] <jj5> if you use option 1 you can use an auto commit transaction. if you use 2 or 3 you will need a transaction and suitable isolation level.
[19:29:15] <mockturtle> Coloring With Code — A Programmatic Approach To Design [javascript web graphics] (adamshaylor) https://lobste.rs/s/plofrw
[19:30:00] <jj5> I like option 1. it uses the most data but its simple and easy to get audit data from it (because it has every internal ID in it you can just join on it to get info about how and when and by whom the IDs where allocated)
[19:31:15] <rb> yeah i might go with that
[19:31:33] <rb> a few hundred thousand IDs never hurt anybody hey
[19:31:45] <jj5> no that's nothing
[19:33:48] <jj5> I use two database connections, one called 'raw' which has auto commit on, and one called 'trn' which I use explicit transaction management on. internal IDs are managed via the 'raw' connection outside of my business logic transactions
[19:34:22] <jj5> (you should never rollback an insert into your internal ID table)
[19:34:28] <rb> interesting approach
[19:34:30] <rb> right...
[19:34:43] <jj5> yeah I call it the "two connection approach"...
[19:35:15] <jj5> (actually it's five connections: raw, trn, emu, aux, dba... but who's counting.)
[19:35:28] <rb> hah, no idea what those are
[19:35:35] <jj5> raw: auto commit, never rollback
[19:35:44] <jj5> trn: business logic, begin/commit/rollback
[19:35:58] <jj5> emu: like 'raw' but emulate prepares (PHP PDO thing)
[19:36:36] <jj5> aux: like 'raw' but *never* begin a transaction (raw can begin transactions in some states)
[19:36:52] <jj5> dba: connect to database with root user for database admin
