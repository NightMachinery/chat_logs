[00:03:25] <estranger> i goofed in 2019 and got $23k back haha well, half was my new job not deducting a few things right.. thought for sure id get an audit then
[00:03:44] <Steeve> so they took way too much from each check?
[00:04:17] <estranger> they took social security out when they shouldn't have... but thats prob something I should have communicated to them

[06:55:28] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Congrats! Hope it goes well.
[06:55:59] <catbeard> ok so
[06:56:04] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Legit had a interview on Saturday. Told them to reschedule it for the following Monday.
[06:56:12] <catbeard> question about CAA inheritance
[06:56:47] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> For SSL?
[06:56:59] <catbeard> for DNS but yeah for SSL issuance CA restrictions
[06:57:56] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Ok. What's the question?
[06:58:42] <catbeard> if parent zone has e.g `CAA 0 issue "ca_here"` but not `CAA 0 issuewild "ca_here"` any CA that issues domain + wildcard at the same time (SAN) wouldn't work unless you also had `subdomain IN CAA 0 issue "ca_here"` and `subdomain IN CAA 0 issuewild "ca_here"` right?
[06:58:47] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Imagine CAA for DoH - my brain hurts from thinking about that
[06:59:03] <catbeard> in this example
[06:59:13] <catbeard> say the root domain already has a managed CAA how they want it
[06:59:29] <catbeard> and the only domain we're concerned about covering here is subdomain.domain.com
[06:59:37] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> And you want CAA for wildcard subdomains
[06:59:55] <catbeard> for the subdomain itself, and wildcards of that subdomain e.g. *.sub.domain.com and sub.domain.com
[07:00:06] <catbeard> but only from "ca_here"
[07:00:36] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Ok. I'm sorry but I'm not an authority on this subject.
[07:00:37] <catbeard> which happens automatically, if CAA is set to issue/issuewild to allow our CA
[07:00:42] <catbeard> BOOOOO
[07:00:45] <catbeard> good one
[07:00:50] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> lol
[07:01:43] <catbeard> so like, the subdomain doesn't have any NS records, like it doesn't have it's own dns zone, it's just a record in the parent zone
[07:01:55] <catbeard> an A record
[07:01:57] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Yeah that's how subdomains should be
[07:02:17] <catbeard> so it would then also need subdomain CAA records in the parent zone?
[07:02:20] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Are you self-hosting the NS?
[07:02:33] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Or is it CloudFlare or something
[07:02:35] <catbeard> most definitely not, it's for cisco.com
[07:02:45] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Wait actually?
[07:02:49] <catbeard> yes actually
[07:03:00] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> You work there?
[07:03:03] <catbeard> no
[07:03:16] <catbeard> one of their engineers points the subdomain to us but the cert won't issue
[07:03:22] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Oh
[07:03:45] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Because I mainly use TXT records for R3 cert verification
[07:03:50] <catbeard> and i'm relaying him changes to make to DNS, but he's gotta forward that to DNS team and he doesn't understand it
[07:03:55] <catbeard> i BARELY understand it lol
[07:04:00] <catbeard> yeah we do TXT too
[07:04:03] <catbeard> to prevent hijacks
[07:04:05] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Yeah
[07:04:39] *** Quits: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy) (Quit: Meadow Fresh milk)
[07:04:49] <catbeard> but i'm thinking it's because they need subdomain CAA records, instead of adding to their @ CAA records
[07:04:50] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Because I run my own authoritative nameserver so SSL verification is easily automated through TXT
[07:05:36] <catbeard> because adding `0 issuewild "ca_here"` to the parent zone would allow anyone that uses "ca_here" to issue a ssl certificate for *.cisco.com which is a no-go 
[07:05:51] <catbeard> lol
[07:06:02] <catbeard> it would be funny but lol no

[21:14:59] <JollyRgrs> ntpd?
[21:15:16] <JollyRgrs> but it is more of a "time relay"
[21:15:28] <JollyRgrs> for 50k i assume it keeps its own time based off an atomic clock or something
[21:16:01] <JollyRgrs> still the price seems a bit steep, you can get consumer devices that sync to the atomic clock for less than that
[21:19:54] <sd> 07<Q‚ÄãuantumFoam> you don't even need to sync to the atomic clock; you can just get one of those top strata devices that gets an LTE signal
[21:20:02] <sd> 07<Q‚ÄãuantumFoam> which, in turn, is synced with the atomic clock
[21:20:34] <sd> 07<Q‚ÄãuantumFoam> also the broadcast frequency for the consumer devices isn't strong enough to penetrate a data center
[21:22:43] <csws> GPS clocks are a thing too
[21:23:06] <JollyRgrs> yeah, but GPS is kinda hard to sync to if your DC is in a basement or otherwise in a room with no windows
[21:23:14] <JollyRgrs> you ever used a GPS in a data center?
[21:23:25] <csws> well that's the thing
[21:23:39] <csws> I saw one racked in the colo space for my old jerb
[21:23:48] <csws> so idk if there's an arrangement where they piggyback off of an antennae or something
[21:23:57] <JollyRgrs> might have been using LTE
[21:24:05] <csws> it had GPS written on it though
[21:24:19] <csws> and it was at least switched on
[21:24:20] <JollyRgrs> my old job had cell towers installed at the top of the building to ensure penetration even into the basement (hospital)
