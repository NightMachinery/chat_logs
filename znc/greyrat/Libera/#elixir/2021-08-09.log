[01:04:42] <mhmd> so, I'm parsing some webpages, and in some of them, the data that I'm interested in is stored in js arrays in <script> section
[01:05:16] <mhmd> I can treat it as string and parse it somehow, but the code ends up being a mess
[01:05:46] <mhmd> so does any other ways come to your mind?
[01:08:09] <mhmd> it's mostly something like: "var SomeVariableName=[[60119,'1','1','6307','1578','1580','6650','1'],[60119,'2','1','2000','1561','1581','5555','1'], ...]"
[01:10:37] <mhmd> if I remove '=' and everything behind it, and add space after each comma, then it will be like an elixir list represented as string
[01:11:28] <mhmd> but I'm not sure if it's a good idea...

[12:42:13] <Guest93> anyone know what this method does? https://hexdocs.pm/pow/Pow.Plug.html#fetch_config/1
[12:42:36] <Guest93> and by that i mean what is the configuration it's fetching
[12:43:00] <Nicd> looks to be Pow.Config.t
[12:43:01] <Guest93> this? https://hexdocs.pm/pow/Pow.Config.html#content
[12:44:19] <Guest93> Nicd: and is that just the config :pow defined in config/config.exs?
[12:44:32] <Nicd> I don't know. have you checked it?
[12:45:28] <Guest93> it's not exactly clear to me what it is, looking at the code -> https://github.com/danschultzer/pow/blob/master/lib/pow/config.ex
[12:45:58] <Guest93> "  Methods to parse and modify configurations." doesn't really tell what what configurations it's talking about
[12:46:02] <Nicd> it's a keyword list of values
[12:47:23] <Nicd> I suspect it's any kind of configuration you give Pow 🤷 inspect it to see what it contains
[12:51:54] <Guest93> Nicd: ok apparently it takes a `conn`, but seeing as i'm using absinthe, i guess i can ignore it outright and just pass an empty [] whenever a config is required
[12:52:27] <Nicd> I don't know, I don't use Pow
[12:54:20] <Nicd> but you can move data from conn to absinthe, you just have to do it in a roundabout way: https://gitlab.com/code-stats/code-stats/-/blob/master/lib/code_stats_web/plugs/set_session_user_plug.ex#L39
[12:54:32] <Nicd> (assuming this is when dealing with an HTTP request)
[12:54:59] <Guest93> would you recommend doing that? or does it not really matter?
[12:55:49] <Guest93> i'm doing token-based authentication, so every request to my graphql endpoint should have a token

[12:56:27] <Guest93> so nothing in the conn is really necessary in that context (as far as i understand it, could be wrong though)
[12:56:45] <Nicd> well if you need the config from the conn, then you _have_ to do that. I don't know what to recommend as I don't use Pow
[12:57:34] <Guest93> yeah fair enough, i tried just passing in an empty keyword list and it worked fine, so i'll keep assuming that's ok. Which auth package do you use by the way?
[12:58:40] <Guest93> maybe i should be using Guardian for this, it as a token-first auth package after all
[12:59:19] <Guest93> just used Pow because it's what i'm used to, but i've never built an absinthe phoenix app before, so maybe it's not the best choice for that
[13:00:34] <Nicd> I wrote my own auth
[13:00:49] <Guest93> ah ok

Or if they were, they were not nearly as mature as they are now. I'm not really sure what I would do if I needed it today. I'm still not really familiar with the packages surrounding authorization today.

[23:05:46] <kpanic> hi, I would like to port from Combine to NimbleParsec a very rich parser for a DSL, however I read (h NimbleParsec.parsec) that using defcombinator + parsec might be slow at runtime -- any pointers, maybe on github, on where I can get inspired on how to build efficiently the parser? thanks!

[23:29:34] <hoppity> I preloaded the association already btw
[23:29:48] <benwilson512> if you already preloaded it you don't need to query for it
[23:29:56] <benwilson512> you can just `entity.association_name`
[23:31:23] <hoppity> benwilson512: thank you. What I mean is that I am querying for user profiles, each profile is associated to a rating. So I need to get all proviles with a rating ID of 1 for example.
