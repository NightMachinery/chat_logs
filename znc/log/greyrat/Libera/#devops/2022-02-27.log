[06:13:48] <lantech19446> If only normal sys admins new about Ansible, I fixed one of the major pain points for my users today and what would have taken an hour to do manually took less than a minute with ansible
[06:31:36] <dodo> automation is useful, yes
[06:33:55] <lantech19446> I just don't get how this tech hasn't trickled down yet especially being free and so easy to setup
[06:35:31] <dodo> inertia, job security through obscurity, security concerns,..
[06:39:41] <lantech19446> I think I have better job security since I started using it. Shit gets done now things get updated more routinely servers are updated every 3 hours with the newest antivirus definitions I'm able to make domain wide changes very quickly. The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to build a playbook to build out a new system
[06:40:33] <dodo> until some beancounter thinks an intern can type the commands that you created to do this ðŸ¤¡
[06:41:59] <lantech19446> I've been there for 13 years through crippling depression where literally nothing but the barest minimum got done. In the last year I've really made up for that and the borough loves me so I'm not too worried about that
[06:48:54] <dodo> i'm glad that things are looking up
[06:52:02] <lantech19446> Thank you I got to the point where I couldn't continue feeling that way in 2018 got put on cymbalta which fucked me up worse came to find out I'm bipolar so finally got on the right meds and now I feel like a whole new person
