A good deal of our codebase relies on gpu code and I am trying to find to avoid having us write too many kernels.

[11:09:47] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @ShellTear "Hi, I'm new to nim. Is it possible to compile the nim code to c/c++ code like js?" what did you exactly mean? You want to get the C/C++ source code that Nim compiler creates when compiling your program?
[11:10:36] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> By default Nim saves all C/C++ intermediate sources into the default cache directory of your OS, on Linux that's usually ~/.cache/nim
[11:11:13] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you can change the default cache directory by passing `--nimcache:dirname` to the compilation command, then the intermediate sources will be saved in that directory

[16:06:04] <FromDiscord> <TelegramXPlus (EnteryName)> Hi, I'm new to Nim and Id like to better understand a certain concept. What's the real difference between passing an argument with the keyword var and passing a ref object as argument. I mean when I use var to modify a certain value, it changes the actual parameter so wouldn't the var keyword as argument be like passing a reference/pointer? Thanks in advance for the answers.

[19:01:15] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> `"\"\"" & temp4 & "\"\""`
[19:01:20] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I'll try it right away
[19:03:17] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> it worked
[19:03:33] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> so you need a \ before and after the literal quote
[19:03:41] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> very suspicious
[19:03:52] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> ty cabbose u my bro

[19:05:13] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> (and replacement is done on compile time)
[19:05:23] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> `"\""` will be a single "
[19:05:32] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> `"\"\""` will be two
[19:05:53] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> very suspicious
[19:06:01] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> no?
[19:06:03] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I will try enthusiast suggestion too
[19:06:29] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> works fine for me
[19:07:37] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> you could also consider just creating a template

[22:04:09] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> yea probably it's stderr, but in general any output getting out when you execute the command normally in console

[22:13:02] <FromDiscord> <auxym> There's many options there. The most powerful but somewhat more complicated is using startProcess then errorHandle to get the stderr stream to read from
