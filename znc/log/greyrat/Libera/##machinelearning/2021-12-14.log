[15:44:45] <henistein> I have an agent that moves in some environment and collect data (pygame program). My agent have to make some predictions. I know that the data from the environment will never change, so I don't know what is the best practice to train my agent. Should I train the agent before the program start or should I train the agent while it runs?

[22:30:08] <derelict> is there a non-fed alternative of this channel?
[22:30:26] <derelict> fed*
[22:30:34] <derelict> feed** my apologies 
[22:39:53] <tkr> derelict: I would also love an answer to this question! I feel that I'm missing most of the real questions because of all the food. There is an #ml-news channel that provides even more spam, but I'm not aware of anything that would provide *less* spam.

[22:40:54] <derelict> agreed tkr, ive been looking for a channel to ask questions and discuss broad ML topics. perhaps there could be an initiative to start one if it doesnt exist
[22:42:25] *** Joins: Andrynet1 (~Andrynet@186.46.205.112)
[22:43:41] <tkr> Yes, there would! But the obvious problem is getting the amount of traction to have one question (and obviously some discussion) during - let's say - a month...
[22:44:54] <tkr> This is such an obvious channel name and people just don't IRC that much nowadays, and because of that I think it would be really hard. But would love it also! :) Just a random question every now and then and then join #ml-news to follow the spam.
[22:47:51] <tkr> (Not that I'm following mostly anything that FeedBot feeds here.. I remember seeing a message from a channel op that stated something like this: "I'll just put the FeedBot back here since it's so quiet anyways...")
[22:56:05] <tkr> derelict: I have actually tried to do something along those lines (see: https://forums.fast.ai/t/irc-practical-deep-learning-on-freenode/4820), but it didn't work out. If you ever decide to have your own try, please feel free/obligated to send me an invitation to the channel!

[23:13:39] <derelict> tkr: true, but im not sure there would be a lack of engagement. if you check out ##programming or any language-related channel, youll see it's booming with activity. with ML being such a hot topic, i'm sure that, if some domain experts participate, the channel will be active in no time 
[23:14:11] <derelict> ill consider this more over the weekend. maybe it goes somewhere
