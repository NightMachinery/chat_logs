[00:00:19] <yrk> lisp123_: MIT (also known as the Expat license) is _compatible with the GPL_, see: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean

[00:01:35] <lisp123_> yrk: I see, thanks. So anybody wanting to use the total package must stick with GPL?
[00:01:48] <lisp123_> and if they just want to use the part that is MIT, then can use that under MIT?
[00:01:53] <yrk> lisp123_: anyone who wants to distribute the work as a whole must do so under the terms of the gpl
[00:02:04] <lisp123_> yrk: Thanks
[00:02:20] <yrk> lisp123_: but, yes, they could take just the Expat/MIT part and distribute that under Expat/MIT if they can identify it!
[00:02:20] *** Joins: maknho (~maknho@user/maknho)
[00:03:26] <yrk> lisp123_: unfortunately, the same is true of a proprietary developer. they can combine their proprietary work with the Expat/MIT and release the combination under a proprietary license.
[00:03:29] <lisp123_> yrk: Perhaps this is getting too legal, but what if I transformed the MIT code (say I ported a JS library issued under MIT to Elisp)
[00:03:53] <yrk> lisp123_: but now it's worse, because nobody can now remove the Expat/MIT from the proprietary seeing as they have no access to the source
[00:04:07] <lisp123_> the actual code is different, but it is clearly a derivative work. I was wondering if the original author must approve the converstion of my version to GPL?
[00:04:15] <yrk> lisp123_: translation is covered under copyright law and doesn't change the license
[00:04:30] <lisp123_> yrk: Thanks! That makes sense
[00:04:38] <yrk> lisp123_: the tranlastion would be still under the same license and have the same copyright holders
[00:05:14] <lisp123_> Yes, as long as people can figure out that part of the code (of course I make it clearly visible, since I want to respect the original author's rights)

[00:06:14] <yrk> lisp123_: the closest we can get to protecting a piece of flaccidly-licensed code (Expat/MIT/3BSD etc.) all of the "I don't care" licenses, is to intertwine it so closely with the GPL portion that it becomes impossible to separate the two
[00:07:29] <lisp123_> I would definitely do that if the author tried to just release code under the "Open Source" banner but really it was anything but
[00:07:29] <yrk> or convince the developer to grow a backbone
[00:08:05] <lisp123_> I was looking at MathJax and got quite annoyed. They are accepting funding for large institutions, but when I look at the source code, it is all minified and they have 100s of literals everywhere
[00:08:16] <lisp123_> It makes zero sense - they went out of the way to make sure nobody could read their code
[00:13:26] <kittyblam> yeah, accepting funds from large groups is fine, as long as you don't rely on it or let it influence you
[00:13:33] <kittyblam> relying on it or letting it influence you and you get mozilla
[00:13:42] <lisp123_> Yeah, :(
[00:14:05] <kittyblam> or worse than mozilla, its like
[00:15:05] <kittyblam> not enough people understand the difference between relying on something and accepting help
[00:15:55] <lisp123_> It's a tricky area. Got to stand up for one's principles
[00:16:13] <kittyblam> I am not familliar with that specific situation tho, but
[00:16:16] <kittyblam> yeah
[00:16:16] <lisp123_> But one has to put food on the table first
[00:16:34] <lisp123_> Best we can do is keep supporting the FSF :)
[00:17:02] <kittyblam> there seriously needs to be strong public protections and a good UBI so that people can't keep making that argument lol
[00:19:25] <kittyblam> when it comes to fsf type stuff it would be nice if there was more of a focus on improving and moving to XMPP instead of having Matrix slowely leach off of everything, and would be nice if there was more investment into forking OpenBSD and or developing Hurd, but ye there is a lot of nice stuff happening with this type of thing

[03:00:43] <dragestil> yrk: intertwining gpl code with pushover code sounds good. one tricky bit might be making small modifications to pushover code and redistribute it. there's pressure like "re-licensing bsd code under gpl is wrong", but if i only want to write agpl code, then i'll have to redistribute the modified version as a whole under agpl if my change is more than a dozen nontrivial lines
[03:03:11] <kittyblam> I don't get why some people are so weird about using licenses that harm other people like that, there seems to be a lack of understanding the GPL/AGPL is a *free* license.
[03:03:46] <kittyblam> the lgpl seemingly not being the most popular shows that part of the issue (apart from corporate influence/talking points) is just a lack of understanding rather than just wanting something weaker
[03:04:17] <kittyblam> I wonder how succesful a minimaly written strong copyleft that at least provides some protections and can be replaced at any time with the GPL/AGPL would work

I am not sure if doing something like I propose of a minimalist copyleft license would help or if it would just cut i

[13:39:54] <kompowiec2[x]> DiffieHellman: little syph scripts like for colobot have only have educational value.  to protocols because I believe interoperability is more important than freedom
[13:42:19] <kilobug> yeah, protocols and formats are better with a permissive license; like the FSF supported the decision of the Vorbis codec reference implementation being under a permissive (BSD IIRC) license, and I agree with that
[13:43:31] <DiffieHellman> Well kinda, but even then, very little proprietary platforms or devices actually support ogg Vorbis.
[13:43:59] <DiffieHellman> You can have both interoperability and freedom.
[13:45:48] <kilobug> I've had a few hardware device with embeded non-free software supporting vorbis, but sure not as frequently as we might have wished
[13:50:30] <kompowiec2[x]> yeah. but if they were gpl only, the obstinacy might be stronger.
[13:51:22] <DiffieHellman> Really, if they went for the GPL, they would have pretty much the same result, except more freedom.

[22:30:35] <xx> what happens if someone sends a physical letter to FSF, asking for a copy of the GPL?
[22:30:41] <xx> has anyone ever done that?
[22:31:00] <xx> it's included in so many headers, but feels... strange.
[22:31:32] <Noisytoot> someone has probably done that
[22:31:40] <Noisytoot> you probably get a copy of the GPL sent back
[22:32:02] <xx> but, why would anyone ask for it, when it is free online?
[22:34:04] <Noisytoot> maybe they don't have internet access
[22:34:44] <Noisytoot> I think it's usually in GPLv1/GPLv2 license headers, not GPLv3
[22:36:10] <Noisytoot> The WWW was quite new then
