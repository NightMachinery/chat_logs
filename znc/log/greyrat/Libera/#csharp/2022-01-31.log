[00:03:53] <hseg> hrm. though it seems this pattern generalizes: http://ix.io/3O4q
[00:04:21] <hseg> (and generalizing pointed out a bug in my original code -- items.First() was counted twice
[00:07:35] <hseg> though it is a bit clunky to use in practice -- items.Partials(f) now becoms items.SeedFirst((s,i) => i.Partials(s,f))
[00:08:32] <hseg> ... ig I _could_ just overload Partials so the single-param version computes the composition with SeedFirst
[00:08:51] <hseg> probably more readable and less error-prone
[00:09:19] <xb0o2> hseg, the problem is your 2nd function
[00:09:53] <xb0o2> (in your original example)
[00:10:21] <hseg> yes, it doesn't yield return

[00:11:30] <hseg> should work now, hopefully
[00:11:53] <xb0o2> You don't need to yield at all
[00:12:22] <hseg> oh?
[00:12:23] <xb0o2> `return items.Any() ? items.Partials(items.First(), mapper) : Enumerable.Empty<T>();`
[00:13:21] <hseg> so Suchiman's advice that I needed to iterate-yield the output of the items.Partials call was incorrect?
[00:16:49] <Suchiman> hseg: anyway, the cool and most performant way of writing it is https://gist.github.com/Suchiman/0ef11382eac31939e93f503db1ff3d8c anyway :P
[00:18:40] <xb0o2> In the example of the code you originally wrote, I don't think so, no. But what was just posted will work with is a much more 'correct' implementation because it won't inadvertently consume members of the IEnumerable for the `Any` call.
[00:19:30] <xb0o2> Some dodgy English in there but still
[00:21:05] <hseg> wait, .Any() can have side-effects?
[00:22:42] <Suchiman> hseg: well, check out the impl https://source.dot.net/#System.Linq/System/Linq/AnyAll.cs,8788153112b7ffd0
[00:23:23] <xb0o2> It's basically what you'd expect - it does the `GetEnumerator/MoveNext` dance and returns true if appropriate
[00:23:42] <bpmedley> Omg, authorization and authentication feels fragmented with and without duende..
[00:23:44] <xb0o2> What side effects that may have depend on the IEnumerable
[00:24:42] <xb0o2> For things backed by memory it's very likely GetEnumerator will get you a fresh enumerator starting from 'position 0' but in other cases that might not be true (like streamed data)
[00:25:00] <Suchiman> ^ which is generally the case for outputs from generator methodfs
[00:26:42] <biberu> hseg: your example could have interesting effects indeed, like e.g. issuing three queries to a db
[00:28:34] <hseg> ugh. this vocabulary doesn't look very composable
[00:28:55] <Suchiman> hseg: huh? xD
[00:29:14] <hseg> am trying to rewrite SeedFirst in light of the above, and I'll basically need to implement everything by hand
[00:29:36] <hseg> which isn't _too_ much of a pain in this case
[00:29:41] <hseg> but it's annoying
[00:31:01] <hseg> this is what I've ended up with http://ix.io/3O4w
[00:32:02] <Suchiman> hseg: (IEnumerable<T>)it this is a dangerous and usually wrong assumption
[00:32:18] <hseg> hrmph.
[00:32:28] <hseg> so this, too, I'll need to unpack?
[00:33:18] <biberu> why not just use Suchiman's example?
[00:33:59] <hseg> Because I'd like to have both the seed-supplying version and the seedless version?

[00:34:58] <hseg> if I have to, I'll do it
[00:35:15] <hseg> but it's annoying that this is the idiomatic c# way
[00:35:17] <Suchiman> it does have a little bit of duplication but i wouldn't bend over to and sacrifice performance to reuse a lil bit
[00:35:46] <biberu> dry is evil
[00:36:08] <hseg> dry can be the motivator for finding good abstractions
[00:36:14] <hseg> not saying this one is

[11:37:37] <shadowchaser> but google's is probably the worst, I always spent hours trying to find what I want
[11:38:47] <shadowchaser> yesterday I was using AWS, it wasn't pleasant, but I've achieved what I wanted within seconds, granted it was my first cloud, so I'm probably most familiar with it
[11:44:16] <ap5> GCE is way better than Azure imho

[12:42:08] <MatthiasVance> That's a fact
[12:42:35] <ap5> Nasp: GCE with k8s is far ahead of the other providers. Mainly because you have this thing called a Cloud configurator, that you can integrate with your helm charts, by which you can define what cloud resources that needs to be spun up. Fx: i have a template defined for a service, and i have also defined that i want a service principal for it and a postgres database. Then it is all defined in k8s and spun up when deploying said
[12:42:36] <ap5> helm chart. It is really nice.

[17:37:06] <xb0o2> lz_, as riksteri just said, if a deliverable is part of a contract then you're not just 'estimating'
[17:37:36] <xb0o2> I mean, dealing with contracts, prices and variations is literally a whole profession in itself
[17:38:30] <xb0o2> Otherwise my rule of thumb is take an educated guess based on experience and at least double it :-)
[17:38:46] <lz_> xb0o2: sure but since knowing in advance how long sth is going to take is basically impossible, I was wondering how they were doing it
[17:39:23] <lz_> the "double" magic doesn't work at all, not for me anyway. Sometimes you end up finishing 10 times faster, sometimes it takes 10 times longer
[17:39:36] <xb0o2> Exactly, it all comes out in the wash
[17:39:54] <lz_> I was wondering if contractually there was ways to handle these properly with fallback goals etc
[17:40:21] <xb0o2> If you're faster, you say "hey, great, we got this done faster than expected.". If you're slower, you say "ok, we've hit x, y, z snags and we think that affects our original estimate by q".
[17:40:36] <xb0o2> And if you want to keep people happy, you make sure that that communication is on point.

[17:42:18] <lz_> yeah then there's no contract issue
[17:42:22] <xb0o2> I have two contractor friends and they both bill accurately.

[17:43:30] <xb0o2> They bill in days but the same principle applies regardless - if they complete a 4 week project in 3 weeks, they bill for 3 weeks. If it takes them 5 weeks, they bill for 5 weeks.
[17:44:09] <xb0o2> But again that's secondhand experience so ymmv.

[17:44:46] <riksteri> I've sometimes seen contracts of the nature "deliverable Y will be done in X hours" where there was a monetary bonus for being faster and a penalty for being late. Not that I think it's a good idea, it had weird incentives, like not reporting all the hours you work.
[17:44:46] <lz_> and best one can ever do is estimates
[17:45:01] <riksteri> just relaying what kind of contracts I've seen in the wild

[21:32:44] <lz_> ofc 2nd seller also increased the price because he saw I was desperate :D
[21:32:53] <lz_> I'm losing on all fronts

[23:00:38] <Fiji_> nice photo, gj
[23:02:10] <Suchiman> Fiji_: well, the original photo looks more like this https://welp.dev/2022-01-29_01-21-05.png and the reality is a little bit more in the direction of the edited picture but not quite xD

[23:04:24] <MatthiasVance> Is RAW actually raw? As in, straight from the sensor before any processing?
[23:04:35] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: yep
[23:04:41] <MatthiasVance> neat
[23:05:30] *** Bitflux is now known as Byteflux
[23:05:34] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: the raw data in there isn't displayable without some post processing, the earliest stage in processing that can be made out as a picture is this https://welp.dev/mosaic.png before demosaicing

[23:07:13] <lz_> why didnt anyone invent a sensor that measure all frequencies
[23:07:27] <lz_> s
[23:07:40] <lz_> or you know, rgb all at once
[23:08:10] <lz_> am gonna patent the idea and become rich
[23:08:52] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: Ah, interesting :o
[23:09:20] <ki9a> evening
[23:10:33] <MatthiasVance> harro
[23:10:43] <MatthiasVance> Bolero
[23:10:46] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: the sensor only measures the luminance, not the chrominance, in order to get chroma, a color filter is applied over the sensor as you can see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing
[23:10:52] <Suchiman> and then the color data needs to be interpolated
[23:13:01] <lz_> Suchiman: it's weird because 24mpix cameras seem to take actual 6k*4k pictures; or are they demoisaiced too?
[23:13:25] <lz_> don't you loose like 3x the pixels
[23:13:53] <Suchiman> lz_: if you were not to interpolate the color, then you would have to downsample and then you loose 4x the pixels
[23:14:07] <khanred> computers are dumb
[23:14:30] <lz_> hmm yeah there's more info than 1/4 because there's luminance for each sensor; still the demoisaicing result seems quite poor
[23:14:57] <Nasp> Suchiman:  How do you get your 7 pro to take decent pics?
[23:15:00] <Nasp> Use raw?
[23:15:46] <lz_> I guess there are other filters avec that take care of making an image a bit less dumb
[23:15:50] <Suchiman> lz_: i dunno, it's something with the demosaicing algorithmus i suppose, the native image that the phone processed itself looks better https://welp.dev/native.png
[23:16:43] <lz_> Suchiman: yeah there's probably some sort of edge aware smoothing
[23:17:20] <lz_> using the edges from the luminance data
[23:18:19] <Suchiman> lz_: https://welp.dev/ahd.png ---> uses AHD from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing#Pixel_correlation_within_an_image
[23:19:12] <Suchiman> lz_: also tried a few other algorithmns, https://welp.dev/bilinear.png https://welp.dev/vng.png https://welp.dev/ppg.png https://welp.dev/ahd.png and from the adobe dng sdk https://welp.dev/adobe.png
[23:19:21] <lz_> cool stuff, thanks for sharing. Maybe that'll come handy when I receive the fucking broken camera
[23:20:19] <MatthiasVance> Pfft
[23:20:20] <MatthiasVance> lz_: !
[23:27:48] <Suchiman> Nasp: it's the 7T, not 7 Pro :P dunno if that makes a difference, i'm not unhappy with the picture quality, although i feel like RAW disimproves the quality as the builtin algorithm seems better at fixing up the algorithm than other programs i could find but it opens up a lot of options for editing, e.g. have look at Snapseed for android, very powerful and free
[23:28:10] <Suchiman> Nasp: Snapseed is how i turned https://welp.dev/2022-01-29_01-21-05.png into https://welp.dev/IMG_20220128_172713-01.jpeg
[23:29:51] <blezz> Suchiman install Google Camera, it will take better photos
[23:30:16] <lz_> you need to take it from an alternative store though
[23:30:46] <lz_> I tried it once when i was testing a phone I returned since; worked like a charm for a day and the next day it was crashing the gallery each time I took a picture
[23:31:01] <lz_> but yeah the resulting pictures seemed fine
[23:31:04] <blezz> it's a direct link. https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/p/gcam-oneplus-7-t-pro/
[23:31:39] <blezz> lz_ depends on the build. The only requirement is to have Snapdraggon CPU. Doesn't work with others
[23:32:24] <lz_> blezz: it also requires the camera to support a bunch of stuff, but that wasn't why it was crashing on my phone. I havent investigated more
[23:33:01] <lz_> tried to fine a gcam for my older phone but camera isn't supported
[23:33:11] <lz_> it needs to handle a bunch of apis
[23:33:21] <blezz> needs android 10 at least, afaik
[23:34:02] <lz_> my old phone is android 10
[23:34:05] <blezz> it works fine with nokia, xiaomi and oneplus, not that great with samsung (with snapdragon)
[23:34:18] <lz_> it's a nokia. depends on the camera
[23:34:25] <blezz> doesn't work with huawei and samsung's exynos
[23:34:52] <lz_> it needs to support "manual mode" for a bunch of stuff like aperture etc
[23:34:53] <blezz> on nokia it should work flawlessly. Just try a different build
[23:34:57] <lz_> no
[23:35:01] <lz_> I've researched this
[23:35:23] <blezz> I got pixel anyway, got tired of this
[23:35:38] <blezz> modding and fixing stuff just to take proper photos
[23:37:11] <lz_> it works if the camera is accessible through the Camera2 API, there are checker tools on android store
[23:37:46] <lz_> sth like that https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.vipek.camera2_compatibility_test&hl=en_US&gl=US
[23:37:50] <blezz> yea, I know
[23:41:44] <Nasp> Suchiman:  My 7 Pro looks like shit when taking pictures
[23:45:12] <lz_> Nasp: could be a good sign if you're taking pictures of shit?
