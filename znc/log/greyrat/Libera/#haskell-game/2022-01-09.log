[00:53:33] <EvanR> is this ironic. On this page of royalty free sound loops, you can get the MP3 version for free, a simple link. But a pay wall exists for the OGG version
[00:54:35] <EvanR> https://soundimage.org
[00:55:16] <f-a> ;_;
[00:56:24] <EvanR> soon windows will be free and linux is a premium members only download
[00:57:10] <__monty__> It's normal to charge for quality: )
[00:59:14] <EvanR> yeah just takes 25 to 30 years for the market to realize
[01:06:01] <EvanR> my sounds support so far only includes OGG
[01:06:17] <EvanR> why did I go for such premium

[01:45:13] <icrbow[m]> BTW, why haven't everybody moved to Opus instead? It existed for quite a time and has superior quality (or advertised to have).
[01:45:32] <icrbow[m]> (yes, I know ogg is a container and I mean to move from Vorbis the codec)

[03:20:23] <EvanR> why are there profunctor optics in minecraft https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper/tree/master/src/main/java/com/mojang/datafixers/optics/profunctors
[03:26:06] <ManofLetters[m]> wow
