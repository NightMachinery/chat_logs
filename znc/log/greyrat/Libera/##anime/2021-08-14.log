[04:07:20] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[04:07:58] <ButterNoodle> its great to heat up the roads
[04:08:08] <ButterNoodle> which makes the bike tires grip better
[04:08:21] <ButterNoodle> that about it
[04:09:08] <amigojapan> I can't imagine riding a motorcycle in mid summer, without AC, that can't be comfortable
[04:09:32] <ButterNoodle> below 120kph.. it sucks

[04:10:23] <ButterNoodle> kmh?
[04:10:30] <amigojapan> Ah
[04:10:33] <ButterNoodle> kilometers per hour?
[04:10:44] <ButterNoodle> idk I dont use those units
[04:10:48] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[04:11:16] <ButterNoodle> I constantly do the rough conversions in my head
[04:11:31] <ButterNoodle> when I talk about it being almost 40c with heat index yesterday...
[04:11:48] <ButterNoodle> ~105F
[04:11:56] <ButterNoodle> fucking hot
[04:12:18] <amigojapan> !c 105f to c
[04:12:19] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: 105 Fahrenheit = 40.5556 Celsius
[04:12:36] <amigojapan> Yeah seems it's roughly right
[04:12:51] <ButterNoodle> !c 60mph to kmh
[04:12:52] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: 60 Miles per hour = 96.5606 Kilometer per hour
[04:12:59] <ButterNoodle> well I was off on that
[04:13:12] <ButterNoodle> !c 120kmh to mph
[04:13:13] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: 120 Kilometer per hour = 74.5645 Miles per hour
[04:13:31] <ButterNoodle> yea the wind feels nice that fast
[04:13:45] <amigojapan> I see
[04:14:01] <ButterNoodle> there is a stretch on interstate I run ~100mph on.. and thats too much wind
[04:14:21] <ButterNoodle> the same stretch I broke the windscreen on
[04:15:12] <amigojapan> That sounds pretty fast
[04:15:53] <ButterNoodle> kinda fast.. real fast in a car.. but interstate speeds are 70... so people go 85 anyway
[04:16:05] <ButterNoodle> !c 85mph to kmh
[04:16:06] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: 85 Miles per hour = 136.794 Kilometer per hour
[04:16:28] <ButterNoodle> I dont think there are any public roads in japan that fast
[04:17:22] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: once I took a car without power steering up to 200kmh. The steering wheel was shaking like hell
[04:17:45] <ButterNoodle> lol.. feel every bump

[04:18:24] <ButterNoodle> I dont drive cars that fast..

[04:27:30] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: only you can prevent forest fires... click the AC up 2 degrees to save a tree
[04:28:19] <amigojapan> Lol
[04:28:21] <MootPoot> forest fire = smoke and smog in air = AC needs to be switched into recirculation mode or the air purifier needs to be cranked up

[04:28:41] <ButterNoodle> Macer.. noted
[04:29:01] <MootPoot> I dont have a air quality sensor so the only way to do it is to know of the forest fire beforehand or air quality

[04:29:59] <amigojapan> MootPoot: well even if I accept that as valid. You could still get that data online
[04:30:02] <Macer> i think the board is actually flawed because there are others with this same sort of instability 
[04:30:21] <Macer> so i may try to fire up my 1u supermicro and migrate everything to that in order to rma it
[04:30:34] <Macer> maybe they'll send me back an x570 instead of an x470 replacement lol
[04:30:48] <ButterNoodle> from asrock?
[04:31:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: also instead of sensors, all you really need is next days weather forecast and a way to turn on the AC a bit early
[04:32:37] <amigojapan> MootPoot: using sensors is kind of over kill
[04:32:52] <ButterNoodle> I against any kind of sensor
[04:35:04] <MootPoot> The weather forcast is really useless for something as specific as one house
[04:35:23] <MootPoot> often citywide weather will tell me its raining whereas its 100% sunny in my part
[04:35:49] <MootPoot> its okay for temps, but for weather conditions, humidity and air quality its meh
[04:36:10] <amigojapan> Alright MootPoot 
[04:37:02] <MootPoot> well, my universal IR remote already came with a temp and humidity sensor tbh, and my air purifier is always on
[04:37:09] <MootPoot> so its really only the AC that needs to be controlled
[04:37:35] <MootPoot> atm I have conditions on IR remote to toggle the AC to specific conditions based on temp and humidity
[04:38:00] <MootPoot> but I'd like to port that over to a script or something that I can use in more detail
[04:39:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I do fine with weather forecast and timer

[06:09:11] <amigojapan> mathu: no. It is just that Apple is super evil and they want you to buy two super expensive devices. Or four. iPhone iPad Apple watch and Mac
[06:09:59] <amigojapan> mathu: and they will do whatever to try to force you to buy them
[06:10:40] <mathu> amigojapan: the number of people who have an ipad and want to code so they go buy a mac is like... probably a couple thousand people. compared to millions of iphone and mac sales to other markets. there is no incentive for them
[06:11:29] <mathu> it'd be really hard, it'd probably compromise their security architecture a bit, and it would honestly probably be pretty thankless. you might stop calling them evil on irc but you're not gonna buy any more or less apple products and very few people will either
[06:12:15] <mathu> i think it would be great, it'd expose tons and tons of kids to programming i bet, but i think even if apple wanted to they just can't justify it. it makes no sense for them to do it

[06:36:34] <mathu> Aurora_v_kosmose: what i mean is, the function of an NSL is to prevent an email provider from informing anybody that the government subpoenaed data about a journalist or whatever. the DoJ can ask apple for a list of non-CSAM reports that they did or didn't forward to NCMEC, and they can compel apple not to tell anybody that they did that, but they can't compel apple not to share the same fact publicly

[06:51:20] <mathu> reality is really messy and i agree all of these things are going to be big problems in apple's system. but like, you're saying the existence of these complications means the people who are pushing for these systems have ulterior motives. that doesn't follow at all

[06:54:50] <Jigsy> No ifs, no buts, no hyperbole.
[06:54:52] <Jigsy> It will be abused.
[06:55:03] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, it
[06:55:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I agree with Jigsy 
[06:55:13] <Jigsy> First it's CP.
[06:55:13] <mathu> Jigsy: you're telling me a lot of thigns about what i think. you're really not reading what i'm saying
[06:55:19] <S_T_A_N> It's still not scanning pics and deciding if they are 17 or 18
[06:55:25] <Jigsy> Then it's drawings because stupid countries like Australia and the UK bitched about them.
[06:55:27] <amigojapan> I never said Windows mathu 
[06:55:28] <Jigsy> Then terrorism materials.
[06:55:35] <mathu> amigojapan: beside the point but okay
[06:55:39] <Jigsy> Then anything that damages the reputation of politicians.
[06:55:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: If they include the fishy AI recognition part, yes.
[06:55:45] <Jigsy> State secrets, etc, etc.
[06:55:50] <mathu> amigojapan: but that isn't an argument in your favor. the market share of linux is even smaller
[06:55:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm aware of no fuzzy hashing algorithms that work on image-wise modifications.
[06:56:19] <S_T_A_N> > In the document, Apple says it won‚Äôt rely on a single government-affiliated database ‚Äî like that of the US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC ‚Äî to identify CSAM. Instead, it will only match pictures from at least two groups with different national affiliations.
[06:56:30] <mathu> Aurora_v_kosmose: i mean how much of the academic literature on the topic are you reading?
[06:56:48] <amigojapan> mathu: if they allowed it, Apple would not need to develop it for Linux, Linux would have figured it out on their own
[06:56:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: Different national associations... if they're all part of 14 eyes that doesn't mean much.
[06:57:06] <S_T_A_N> > , Apple will only flag an iCloud account if it identifies 30 images as CSAM. This threshold was picked to provide a ‚Äúdrastic safety margin‚Äù to avoid false positives,
[06:57:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mathu: I was looking for libraries do so myself to delete duplicates in my image libraries because I've accumulated stuff from imageboards over decades in varying resolutions and it's absolutely unsortable.
[06:57:45] <amigojapan> What is CSAM?
[06:57:52] <mathu> amigojapan: child sexual abuse material
[06:57:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Child Sexual Abuse Materal.
[06:57:54] <RenAdjest2> Don't forget Disney, they'll love it that they can scan pirated media on every devices and sue everyone who got "caught". 
[06:58:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because apparently "CP" wasn't good enough and they needed a weirder catchterm.
[06:58:09] <S_T_A_N> >  Furthermore, it says it will ‚Äúrefuse all requests‚Äù for moderators to report ‚Äúanything other than CSAM materials‚Äù for accounts that get flagged ‚Äî referencing the potential for using this system for other kinds of surveillance.
[06:58:20] <S_T_A_N> They claim they will refuse to do any more
[06:58:24] <amigojapan> Ah ok . Thanks guys. But does that include drawings?
[06:58:31] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, no
[06:58:32] <Jigsy> Like how Google claimed to "Do No Evil?"
[06:58:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: Yes. Apple sure doesn't have a history of going back on claims when ti's convenient.
[06:58:36] <mathu> amigojapan: drawings will not be in the NCMEC database of CSAM, no
[06:58:42] <amigojapan> Ah ok S_T_A_N 
[06:58:44] <Jigsy> Until they scrubbed that from their mantra?
[06:58:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (that's sarcasm btw)
[06:59:09] <Jigsy> Actually, that's the only benefit of the entire thing.
[06:59:14] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, well if you don't trust them why would you ever use their products anyway?
[06:59:15] <Jigsy> To find out if drawings ARE in fact hashed.
[06:59:38] <mathu> Aurora_v_kosmose: i just feel like you're learning new details about this as we talk more and adjusting your cynical responses, posturing as if you knew them the whole time :P
[06:59:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: I don't, and I don't. I am profoundly disturbed by the precedent they're trying to establish.
[06:59:58] <S_T_A_N> mathu, lol that's exactly it
[07:00:06] <mathu> i agree with you that this is bad and will be abused but like, i'm actually trying to learn about the issue
[07:00:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mathu: Not really. I've heard conflicting coverage. Some said AI, some said hashes.
[07:00:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is real and which is some journo shitposting I don't know
[07:00:28] <S_T_A_N> and why I had to chime in seeing people talk about things they have't even put a little bit of research into
[07:00:43] <mathu> Aurora_v_kosmose: read what alex stamos and matthew green have to say about it
[07:00:46] <Jigsy> I need to research governments being authoritarian?
[07:01:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: Nah, you live in UK, you get a passing mark by default
[07:01:07] <mathu> Aurora_v_kosmose: neither are journos, and one of them is facebook's former CISO who oversaw FB's CSAM reporting operations and has working relationships with people in the DoJ and NCMEC
[07:01:29] <Jigsy> I still say make children illegal.
[07:01:35] <mathu> Jigsy: i agree with that
[07:01:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lol
[07:01:37] <Jigsy> After several decades, the problem solves itself once and for all.
[07:01:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lol
[07:01:47] <S_T_A_N> If goverments insisted this would already be a thing and no one would know about it. This tech, this method have been a thing for years. Just because it's the first you have heard of it doesn't mean a thing.
[07:02:23] <amigojapan> Jigsy: put all children in jail until they grow up?
[07:02:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No, it actually matters because it's a public thing.
[07:02:37] <S_T_A_N> Apple hasn't opened some pandora's box by doing this
[07:02:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of course they've been doing that shit on the sly for years/decades.
[07:02:44] <S_T_A_N> That box was already open
[07:02:44] <Jigsy> [03:32:37] <S_T_A_N> Apple hasn't opened some pandora's box by doing this
[07:02:47] <Jigsy> Sure they have.
[07:02:58] <mathu> and to stress, i agree this is a bad idea. but the reasons it's even on the table are as complex as the problems it will have
[07:02:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: But they didn't come right out and say "lol all your files are belong to us"
[07:02:59] <Jigsy> Because now it'll eventually have to be a default for everything.
[07:03:00] <S_T_A_N> Jigsy, no they have not. This has ALREADY been a thing
[07:03:09] <Jigsy> Android, Windows, Linux.
[07:03:30] <Jigsy> Well, maybe not so much Linux because that's open source.
[07:03:42] <S_T_A_N> Never Linux lol
[07:03:47] <mathu> S_T_A_N: it's too soon to say if this is a pandora's box but this definitely is a potential inflection point
[07:03:52] <Jigsy> But Apple now have an Inch.
[07:04:02] <Jigsy> So sooner or later someone'll take a fucking Astronomical Unit.
[07:04:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> One that never should have been.
[07:04:18] <S_T_A_N> mathu, It's been a thing. People who care already knew about it. If it's a box it's a box that had already been open
[07:04:50] <mathu> S_T_A_N: perceptual hashing has been a research area, but it hasn't been deployed by default on devices as widely used as iphones
[07:05:05] <S_T_A_N> It's been on platforms more widely used
[07:05:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: You don't notice that it's also acting as a message that they don't feel like they need to hide that shit anymore?
[07:05:17] <mathu> S_T_A_N: like?
[07:05:18] <Jigsy> Who the fuck stores CP on a phone, anyway?
[07:05:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: Lots of people no longer have conventional computers. I consider them insane or just very poor, but they exist.
[07:05:45] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, it's not been hidden. You just didn't know about it because the media didn't talk about it much
[07:05:52] <mathu> Jigsy: wasn't it you who pointed out that most abuse happens from people the victim knows? it's not some guy with untraceable film cameras in a balaclava
[07:05:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (For the very poor well... yeah, shit's expensive.)
[07:06:01] <Jigsy> No?
[07:06:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: You're assuming I didn't know. There's a reason I don't use cloud storage.
[07:06:16] <Jigsy> That might have been someone else.
[07:06:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because it's pretty much trusting the host with everything.
[07:06:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is foolish in the extreme.
[07:06:26] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, Yes because that's how you are acting and talking. 
[07:06:27] <mathu> (both Aurora_v_kosmose and Jigsy have been saying similar things and have the same dark green nick color in my client so i may confuse them)

[07:06:45] <Jigsy> :D
[07:07:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: I've been acting like the message it sends matters.
[07:07:03] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, you jumped on the idea that it's been happening and hidden, yet that's not the case, it's been happening in the open with little fanface
[07:07:05] <S_T_A_N> fanfare
[07:07:18] <mathu> S_T_A_N: i don't know of those examples if you have them handy
[07:07:28] <S_T_A_N> Facebook for one
[07:07:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> S_T_A_N: I very much tried to raise fanfare on the previous examples which included files stored on cloud services.
[07:07:57] <mathu> S_T_A_N: FB uses perceptual hashing of non-e2ee media submitted to FB, doesn't it?
[07:07:59] <S_T_A_N> They forward millions of cases a year from using the same technique
[07:08:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For some reason it didn't catch.
[07:08:18] <S_T_A_N> Or was it 10s of millions
[07:08:23] <mathu> S_T_A_N: the new step isn't perceptual hashing, it's the on-device thing

[07:08:41] <S_T_A_N> mathu, it amounts to the same thing. 
[07:09:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> By the way, if any of you knows of a good image hashing library that deals with jpeg re-encoding corruption, resizing, cropping and etc...
[07:09:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm still looking for one.
[07:09:27] <mathu> S_T_A_N: i don't think so; apple is introducing a system where they have the technical means to undermine their own E2EE. facebook's system is not that
[07:09:56] <S_T_A_N> mathu, doesn't the fact that they are doing it on device show that they aren't?
[07:10:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In my opinion, unencrypted cloud storage shouldn't be a thing.
[07:10:10] <Jigsy> So someone asked me if I have a subpeona in my pants and I replied with "No, it's a gag order."
[07:10:44] <mathu> S_T_A_N: no?
[07:11:01] <mathu> S_T_A_N: doing it on device is specifically so they can do it for content that is encrypted going through apple infra
[07:11:28] <mathu> S_T_A_N: and we have to trust apple not to use it for other purposes, or trust that they won't be legally compelled to use it for other purposes, and that's the issue
[07:12:02] <mathu> S_T_A_N: with FB, the e2ee content is still gonna be inaccessible to fB
[07:12:08] <S_T_A_N> For all we know this IS them getting compelled. Either way nothing they do can stop that
[07:12:25] <mathu> in other words, in FB's system you can still be private from FB, but in apple's system you have to trust that apple isn't looking

[07:13:28] <klaxa> that doesn't prove it's *not* a group chat
