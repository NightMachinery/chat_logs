[00:54:10] <kjetilho> so many modifiers I don't know...  ?<, ?> and ?= !
[00:54:21] <mst> remember that inside a string you can escape things by prefixing them with a backslash

[00:54:37] <lotharn> i get that part

[00:56:11] <mst> ^^ I think that's the case they're trying not to screw up
[00:57:29] <kjetilho> Botje: right, thanks - that's one of them.
[00:57:57] <Botje> (?= PATTERN) is a zero-width lookahead for PATTERN
[00:58:09] <Botje> eg it only matches where PATTERN would match, but it does not eat input.
[00:58:24] <Botje> and (?> PATTERN) is basically a red cut.
[00:58:50] <kjetilho> red cut?
[00:59:21] <Botje> well, that's what it's called in Prolog.
[00:59:42] <Botje> once the regex engine enters the (?> ...) it is no longer allowed to backtrack

[01:00:57] <kjetilho> but but but...  there is an OR.  won't the OR be mostly useless if backtracking is disallowed?
[01:01:19] <Botje> look closer. ?> applies to the entire thing.
[01:01:48] *** Joins: Linux77 (~LinuMage@189-48-140-124.user3p.veloxzone.com.br)
[01:01:48] <kjetilho> oh yeah, it's bound to the left side of the OR only
[01:01:55] <Botje> no, it wraps the OR
[01:02:02] <mst> no
[01:02:12] <mst> it's bound to the whole of the or construct
[01:02:15] <mst> that's the entire point
[01:02:27] <mst> that's why botje said 'the entire thing'
[01:02:34] <mst> because he actually read the regexp :P
[01:03:11] <kjetilho> but then I don't understand how no backtracking makes sense
[01:03:24] <Botje> the basic form is (?<InString>(?>____|_____))*(?=____) 
[01:03:59] <kjetilho> it restricts backtracking *before* this construct?  not inside it?
[01:04:29] <Botje> If the bit inside the ?> fails to match, it prevents the regex engine from backtracking to find a match
[01:04:49] <Botje> which is purely an optimization because both cases are mutually exclusive.
[01:05:03] <mst> which may not change the result, but results in the regexp engine not flailing around for hours trying to match the unmatchable
[01:05:26] <Botje> now _there's_ a tagline for a dating website!
[01:05:47] <mst> kjetilho: basically, it's the Sledge Hammer operator
[01:05:53] <mst> kjetilho: "trust me, I know what I'm doing"
[01:06:22] <kjetilho> what a horribly obfuscated regexp
[01:06:27] <Botje> far from it.
[01:07:00] <mst> I wouldn't say it's an ideally designed regexp but it isn't remotely obfuscated
[01:07:15] <Botje> kjetilho: consider the input "a\xb\xc"
[01:07:35] <kjetilho> so - the point if "(?s:.)" is to match *any* character, even linefeeds?
[01:07:39] <Botje> kjetilho: do you agree that it takes the following branches: left, right, left,right, left)
[01:07:51] <Botje> kjetilho: yup

[09:33:23] <rindolf> perlbot: pcre
[09:33:23] <perlbot> rindolf: PCRE (the so-called "Perl-compatible regular expression" library) is not Perl.  It lacks several features of Perl regexes.  Don't bother asking for help with a PCRE pattern in a Perl channel as the answers will not be relevant.  Try #regex, or the channel for your language.  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCRE#Differences_from_Perl and LPBD.

[20:06:39] <LeoNerd> I currently have an interest in it because nvim can use it and it's much better in theory (but not better yet in *practice*) than the dreadfully-silly idea that is vim's own syntax/perl.vim
[20:07:21] <kjetilho> LeoNerd: I hope it keeps it simple ...
[20:07:43] <Altreus> I see
[20:07:43] <LeoNerd> Hm? The point of the tree-sitter is that all the complexity is no longer in the application, it's in a standard shareable place
[20:07:47] <Altreus> sort of
[20:07:56] <kjetilho> ok, obscure pun.  sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-ing
[20:08:00] <Altreus> Is this like those language servers that have taken off recently?
[20:08:06] <LeoNerd> Kinda..

[20:08:11] <haj> LeoNerd: That's why I am watching this with some interest, too.... Emacs will also have tree-sitter integrated.  I wonder how much of the creepy Perl constructs it actually can parse
[20:08:16] <LeoNerd> langserv is a *whole* new level of complexity again
[20:08:27] <LeoNerd> haj: Ohgod it's *horrible* right now

[20:09:11] <LeoNerd> It believes that `my` and `local` are specific statement types rather than expressions, so gets really confused about   printf "One is %d\n", my $one = 1;
[20:09:25] <LeoNerd> ... I could go on about 20 other bugs, but I'll stop there
[20:09:37] <Altreus> only perl can parse perl!
[20:09:46] <choroba> on Tuesdays.
[20:09:48] <Altreus> obviously the best way to do this is just to run the script :)
[20:09:51] <LeoNerd> Eh.. kinda;... but even within that, this thing *could* be huuuugely better than it currently is
[20:10:17] <LeoNerd> It can't get everything 100% correct, but it could probably get to maybe 90% whereas currently I dont' think it's even at 30%
[20:10:29] <LeoNerd> I suspect I could get it to about 85%
[20:11:31] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: MariaDB-NonBlocking-0.31 by HUGMEIR https://metacpan.org/release/HUGMEIR/MariaDB-NonBlocking-0.31
[20:11:44] <haj> Oh yeah.  Consider the fun of POD and here-documents :)
[20:11:57] <LeoNerd> POD should be easy enough. Some cornercases of heredocs might be tricky
[20:12:55] <Altreus> we call those where-docs :D
[20:13:57] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: i've kept meaning to port it to perl itself so that it could be more easily put in a language server for perl
[20:14:09] <LeoNerd> "it"?
[20:14:24] <simcop2387> the treesitter perl implementation, isn't that the JS one?
[20:14:33] <LeoNerd> Oh.. yeah don't do that. That's nto the way to do a real perl one
[20:14:39] <LeoNerd> The real way to do the real perl one is to use the real perl parser
[20:14:45] <LeoNerd> GAH why does nobody ever listen to me?
[20:15:01] <LeoNerd> Use the real perl *parser* but take away its side-effects
[20:15:07] <LeoNerd> So it *isn't* executing any real code
[20:15:16] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: i've wanted it because it can get it good enough without being a security problem like using the real perl parser.  since i don't know how to do that bit you just mentioned
[20:15:24] <LeoNerd> Then Iwill explain
[20:15:29] <LeoNerd> Nobdoy ever asked me so I didn't
[20:15:46] <simcop2387> i didn't think it'd be reasonably possible so i never asked
[20:15:48] <LeoNerd> Take perl's actual real honest-to-god  perly.c  file (and the related .h .act and .tab files)
[20:15:58] <tirnanog> regarding tree-sitter-perl, how about supporting some reasonable subset of perl to begin with, as guacamole does? I know I'd jettison syntax.vim in a heartbeat, despite the trade-offs.
[20:15:59] <Altreus> This sounds like another perl adventure waiting to happen, and I'm already for it
[20:16:08] <LeoNerd> Compile *that* into a brand new C library or binary. It will fail to link because of *lots* of missing functions, relating to optree building or symbol table query
[20:16:18] <LeoNerd> Provide *new* implementations of just those functions, so it can build up an AST
[20:17:09] <LeoNerd> When you're done, you will have a brand new independent C program that can parse an individual perl file into a new AST of whatever shape and information you've designed it to contain, wherein it resolves any parse-time ambiguities using whatever information your imple,mentation decided to feed it
[20:17:13] *** Quits: furrymcgee (~devuan@cgn-89-1-209-226.nc.de) (Quit: leaving)
[20:17:30] <LeoNerd> But you wouldn't have had to independently write a tokenizer, or thing to handle heredocs, or whatever, because you'll just be using the *real* ones out of Perl's real perly.c and toke.c
[20:17:51] <haj> I guess you'd need to be able to include extensions for modules which extend the syntax?
[20:18:04] <LeoNerd> This is the thing I simply haven't had the time or inclination to do over the past 3 years but get annoyed at everyone else *not* doing when they seemingly have plenty of time and motivation to do the wrong thing
[20:18:49] <simcop2387> haj: yea that was one other reason i was thinking the tree-sitter stuff might be better because you can (with sufficient cleverness) compose it a little to fit a lot of that in.
[20:18:53] <LeoNerd> haj: Yes; primarily you'd have to feed it fake knowledge of e.g. the prototypes of List::Util functions or whatever.
[20:19:10] <LeoNerd> But you could keep those in a static lookup table that just has to be maintained by hand somewhere
[20:19:11] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: i believe he's mostly talking about things like Syntax::Keyword::Try
[20:19:22] <LeoNerd> Right. That's a whole new fun one
[20:19:50] <LeoNerd> All of *my* syntax extension modules are now based on XS::Parse::Keyword, which means they all have *static* grammar information that can also be embedded in this new parser
[20:20:01] <LeoNerd> Which is exactly why I wrote them that way in the first place
[20:20:03] <haj> Yes, I'm talking about the guesswork "which {} constructs need a semicolon to end the statement"
[20:20:11] <LeoNerd> Yup. This solves that.
[20:21:52] <Altreus> This would also make tag files good too

[20:32:36] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: that's part of my reasoning to wanting to use it and port it to perl directly too.  that way it could be put into the existing perl language server as a better parser than we have currently there, assuming it can be fixed up better anyway)
