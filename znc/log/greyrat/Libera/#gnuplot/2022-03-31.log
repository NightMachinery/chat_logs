[23:40:41] <Partmedia> Hi, I want to change some default bindings. I see them via `show bind`, for example, "a               `builtin-autoscale` (set autoscale keepfix; replot)". But when I try to "bind f builtin-autoscale", gnuplot-wx crashes when I press 'f' because 'builtin-autoscale' is not a command. How do I bind to one of these builtin- commands?
