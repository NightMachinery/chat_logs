[18:05:55] <xkoncek> does anyone use a linux distro with KDE? can you recommend some? i am disappointed with Fedora Rawhide, considering Arch or Debian sid

[18:49:40] <Renderwww> but does it suck more than the alternatives is the question
[18:50:17] <Renderwww> I can't stand the design choices the gnomies make, wouldn't even care about it if it was totally bug free
