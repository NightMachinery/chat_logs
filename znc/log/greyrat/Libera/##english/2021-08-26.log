[03:05:19] <tokam> With the help of StayHungry we figured out, that I am using the word "leading" as an gerundium (verb) and not as an adjective. That was leading to confusion with my title / question
[03:06:03] <tokam> How differs leading freelancers from leading employees?
[03:06:03] <tokam> Actually I like to use both verbs: managing and leading, but I guess having them both twice in the sentence is too much .... 
[03:06:04] <LuisP18> i supposed that that was a possibility
[03:06:42] <tokam> He correctly pointed out that I should eliminate ambiguity from my title

[05:52:28] <fluter> what does it mean?
[05:54:33] <LuisP18> it's just an interjection, for when making a mistake or when astonished
[05:56:27] <fluter> say in a team chat room, i sent the exact same words as other person in exact same time, in this setup is it approproiate i use the word "snap!" ?

[05:57:32] <LuisP18> (and similar things that create similar sound)

[19:11:41] <CuriosTiger> Amusingly, I didn't have to learn that word as part of learning English.
[19:11:57] <pussipupu> Because the sailing yachts are descended from fast pursuit vessels
[19:11:58] <CuriosTiger> "yacht" has been borrowed into Norwegian as a word for a motor boat designed for leisure.
[19:11:58] <blkshp> HA Jaigurr
[19:12:16] <CuriosTiger> with the pronunciation /jå:t/
[19:12:32] <CuriosTiger> and å probably isn't proper IPA for that vowel, but I'm too lazy to look it up.
[19:15:28] <CuriosTiger> looks like probably /jo:t/ or /jɔ:t/
[19:19:42] <Babar> surprisingly, the word that started my italian friend on his hateful relationship with english was "recipe"
[19:20:04] <CuriosTiger> I remember my first five English words quite well, and they are not the ones you would expect.
[19:20:26] <CuriosTiger> "File", "Edit", "View", "Special" and "key".
[19:21:10] <Babar> not "Shift" "Enter" "Tab" "Insert"?
[19:22:43] <CuriosTiger> Nope. Those words were not spelled out on the keyboard. There was no insert key, the tab key used a right arrow pointed at a vertical line, shift used a hollow up arrow and enter used a down-and-left arrow
[19:23:23] <Babar> hmmm...interesting
[19:23:35] <Babar> End was spelt out
[19:24:50] <pussipupu> I'm pretty sure my first English word was "no"
[19:25:13] <Babar> :D
[19:25:54] <CuriosTiger> I still have an Apple keyboard from that era. Not a single word is spelled out.
[19:26:09] <Babar> ohhh...Apple
[19:26:11] <Babar> one of THOSE
[19:26:23] <CuriosTiger> A few years later, they did spell out "ctrl" and "esc" -- but their original Mac 128K, 512K and Plus keyboard didn't have those keys.
[19:26:52] <CuriosTiger> Babar: "File", "Edit", "View" and "Special" are specific to classic MacOS.
[19:27:19] <CuriosTiger> I'm not going to bother getting into an OS war with you, but yes, the first computer I was exposed to was a Mac 128K, when I was 7 years old.
[19:28:15] <Babar> I have no memory of the first computer I was exposed to. It was a terminal connecting to a neighbourhood server
[19:28:27] <pussipupu> I'm not sure what mine was but it looked a bit like an oscilloscope
[19:28:53] <Babar> but the first I remember was probably a 286
[19:28:58] <pussipupu> and I sat at it long enough that my eyes desensitised to green so everything white looked pink
[19:29:09] <Babar> o_O
[19:29:11] <CuriosTiger> Ours wasn't connected to anything. This was 1984, there was no such thing as connectivity at home. At businesses and government offices, sure.
[19:29:25] <Babar> yeah, this was around that time
[19:29:27] <CuriosTiger> but my dad actually brought this beast home.
[19:29:30] <pussipupu> The first one we owned was an 8086
[19:30:00] <CuriosTiger> I did get to see networked computers at his office (he had just gotten a job at an Apple reseller,) but I didn't understand it at the time. :P
[19:30:00] <Babar> the 286 was a bit late in its life. 1988, I guess?

[19:30:28] <Babar> kinda sad logging into it now
[19:31:00] <CuriosTiger> Technically, the Commodore 64 was the first computer I owned. The Mac 128K was my dad's work computer, which I kind of hogged...I think he got me the Commodore 64 so that I'd leave his alone. It didn't work. :P
[19:31:37] <CuriosTiger> I got a modem and an email account on a BBS in 1988. My first real Internet experience came in 1994 in San Diego, but I was active on BBSes way before then. I even ran one.
[19:31:40] <Babar> oh, I didn't own a computer until university :(

[22:54:38] <MetaNova> they are definitely not the same
[22:55:28] <spinningcat> hmm
[22:55:49] <spinningcat> i am sure it is not same and it is used in different circumstances
[22:56:32] <MetaNova> I could say that 'cozy' is tangentially related to 'dicey' and 'hazardous' by largely implying their opposite
[22:57:22] <MetaNova> spinningcat: why do you ask? did you have a context?
[22:57:36] <spinningcat> i just wonder i dont have context
[22:57:50] <spinningcat> i just try to learn these can be used interchangably
[23:00:05] <Babar> you pick random words to see if they can be used interchangeably?
[23:00:36] <spinningcat> not randomly
[23:01:02] <spinningcat> cozy sounds to me there is some risk something may happen
[23:01:09] <spinningcat> or something at stake
[23:02:37] <StayHungry> spinningcat: hazardous -> involving danger, dicey -> unknown therefore risky outcome (of 'a roll of the dice'), cozy -> usually used about comfort and friendly environment, although there is a meaning suggesting tacit approval ('cozy arrangement with authorities')
