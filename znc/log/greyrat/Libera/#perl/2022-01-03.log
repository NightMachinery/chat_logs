[01:23:31] <simcop2387> and normally you do need root privs to make namespaces, that's why the evalserver is off in it's own process to help isolate things more.  you can actually enable non-root users to do namespaces but i need user namespace support in the evalserver to do it (and there's been some security issues with it before too)

[01:24:33] <simcop2387> cgroup + user namespaces are the next big things for the evalserver so that i can make it run entirely as an unprivileged user, and then in it's own chroot and have it chroot again for each eval and never have it have real root privs anywhere

[01:28:32] <simcop2387> those are the main software things i want/need to do long running evals safely.  right now there are a few ways you can get more resources than you really should be able to get, because you can fork the rlimits apply separately to each process.  with cgroups i can fix that, *AND* also limit the amount of cpu load and io load any given eval can produce.  so i can make sure that no amount of evals
[01:28:38] <simcop2387> can cause too much memory usage and swap, nor can they use too much cpu and ddos things.  right now that can't happen because the VM it's all on has just too much available for it to happen but i want to move it all onto an rpi cluster for the idea of long running stuff.  i want people to be able to use it as a place to host/demo some things like mojolicious or other interactive programs.  i.e.
[01:28:44] <simcop2387> give the pastebin multiple file support, and then let you run a mojo app in an iframe with the console output in another frame
[01:29:13] <simcop2387> the protocol support stuff for the evalserver for that is surprisingly easy since i designed it all originally using protocol buffers.
[01:31:03] <simcop2387> based on what i've seen testing, i *could* allow some limited localhost only networking stuff to do that if i only allow TCP.  but i still want to do the more advanced bit that'd let me do a full userspace networking stack and give you guys TCP, UDP, and even Raw IP and let it tunnel into TOR so that evals could do crazy shit without it coming to me
