[00:53:31] <nomagno> Greetings! Is there any reasoning behind most modern spell-checking dictionaries for American English considering "-our" (as in behaviour) wrong? It would seem Noah Webster simply decided it was wrong in 1820 because, uh, well who knows.

[00:55:09] <MetaNova> I'm not an authority on the history of the English language (you'd need kurahaupo or furrykef for that), but I was under the impression most spelling changes were either a) the public started spelling it that way, and it stuck, or b) as you said, it was arbitrarily decided by someone at some time and everyone just went with it

[01:09:05] <FLHerne> Yeah, it's not that Noah Webster decided it "-or" was better, it's that pretty much everyone else in the US for the last 200 years agreed with him
[01:10:31] <FLHerne> Sometimes there are two spellings that are both considered acceptable in the same region
[01:12:28] <FLHerne> for example both "-ize" and "-ise" suffixes are used commonly in British English, and some people (like me) seem to choose at random half the time

[02:12:51] <CoderGuy> hey so i'm trying to name this object and i'm struggling with understanding language
[02:13:21] <CoderGuy> basically this is a textbox but it's more like a cell where data exists and then you click to change it
[02:13:34] <CoderGuy> so I thought EntryBox would be a great name
[02:13:47] <CoderGuy> problem is, entrybox is used in python but they use it as an inputbox
[02:14:01] <CoderGuy> which leads to the problem of conflicting names
[02:14:23] <CoderGuy> so how can you name something properly and avoid this issue of someone else might use the same name but in a completely different way
[02:17:52] <mornfall> you don't, naming conflicts are bound to happen

[03:03:28] <CoderGuy> yeah but in general i'd like to agree on what an EntryBox is 
[03:03:45] <CoderGuy> or atleast i'd like a name for something where it has data and then you click on it to change the data
[03:04:18] <CoderGuy> so it's like a box it has data in it, you click the box it becomes a textbox you change the data you click off it or hit enter and the new data is entered
[03:11:17] <furrykef> FLHerne: Webster did actively try to reform American English spelling, though, and many of his proposed changes didn't stick. -our to -or is one of the few that did.

[03:15:01] <CoderGuy> mornfall, yeah it works similar to that, but I want an independent object
[03:15:11] <CoderGuy> so more in the area of textbox
[03:15:25] <mornfall> a pre-filled textbox?
[03:15:26] <CoderGuy> or inputbox that's why I thought EntryBox worked but then Python is like "nah that's still just an input box"
[03:15:56] <CoderGuy> I just want an object that more represents this action instead of making a textbox sorta work like it
[03:16:03] <mornfall> if you want a unique name, it has to be pretty specific

[03:16:33] <CoderGuy> well what would you call a box that allows you to hold data and click on it to enter/change data and one specifically designed for data input?
[03:17:00] <mornfall> depends on the type of data; other than that, sounds like every form element ever
[03:17:36] <CoderGuy> but it's not a textbox, it's specifically like a dataentrybox
[03:17:40] <CoderGuy> this is why I think EntryBox works
[03:18:22] <mornfall> forms that interactivly show pieces of data which can be edited have been around since at least foxpro in the early 90s?

[03:18:55] <mornfall> well, do you want to complain that EntryBox is taken, or do you want to solve your problem?
[03:18:56] <CoderGuy> the problem is said forms people would take a textbox and alter its behaviour
[03:19:19] <CoderGuy> I just want to know if there is a better name, OR in the case there isn't what would happen if you had like a wikipedia on entrybox
[03:19:37] <CoderGuy> would it just accept that in python it's a textbox but in my case it's for data?
[03:19:48] <mornfall> it's not going to become a generic name
[03:20:03] <mornfall> it'll be a name of your class and that's about it
[03:20:24] <CoderGuy> yeah but like tkinter totally is like "this entrybox" is for entering text, like an inputbox
[03:20:27] <mornfall> it's not distinct enough from a text box to need a new general name
[03:20:38] <CoderGuy> ic
[03:20:48] <CoderGuy> alright i'll just call it EntryBox I guess and move on but
[03:20:55] <CoderGuy> if there happens to be a better name i'm more than willing to switch
[03:21:34] <mornfall> isn't it really just MVC in disguise?
[03:21:53] <CoderGuy> ummm possibly?
[03:22:13] <CoderGuy> I mean it's just a textbox but it's been changed so that you click on it to enter stuff, which is what people would do but they never made a class for it
[03:22:24] <mornfall> the V bits of MVC are standard controls / form elements with standard names
[03:22:28] <CoderGuy> like if you go to google sheets, they literally have a div and a span and mimic the behaviour
[03:23:14] <mornfall> when you say textbox, do you mean what's normally called a label? a passive element?
[03:23:28] <CoderGuy> no because once you can enter text it becomes a textbox
[03:23:45] <CoderGuy> so it can start as a label, but you click on it it's now a textbox and then you click off it, it goes back to being a label
[03:23:47] <mornfall> right; just wasn't sure if you mean the passive or the active state, when you say textbox
[03:23:59] <CoderGuy> true true, yeah it's both
[03:25:30] <mornfall> or perhaps it's a textbox with a passive-looking inactive state
[03:25:48] <CoderGuy> I mean yeah that's this is all achieavable I just want something where I don't have to set it up everytime
[03:26:03] <mornfall> (whether it's achieved by placing a textbox over a label on click is an implementation detail, really)
[03:26:46] <CoderGuy> so if I make a custom class for it, now I can just use that one. But the problem is naming it properly
[03:26:52] <mornfall> one way to go about it is have EditableFoo for the Foos where it makes sense, assuming you have more than one such Foo
[03:27:19] <CoderGuy> yeah I considered this as well but I don't think this one falls under that category

[09:34:16] <CuriosTiger> I wasn't interested in plates in Europe. But then, European plates just don't vary that much.
[09:34:56] <CuriosTiger> Most of them use either similar fonts or, if they use a font that stands out, they use one that stands out by being fugly (hi, Germany with your FE-Schrift)
[09:35:43] <CuriosTiger> They're pretty much all black on white, at least in the modern era. Some change it up a bit, like the UK with the yellow front plate and Switzerland with the canton coat of arms or Denmark with the parrot plates.
[09:35:54] <CuriosTiger> But for the most part, European plates are fairly uniform and fairly boring.

[09:36:35] <CuriosTiger> American plates, though? And I mean that in the broader sense of the Americas? Separate plates for every state/province/territory/island. Different designs. Different colors. Different graphics.
[09:36:46] <CuriosTiger> That is true. I'm an ICE addict.
[09:36:55] <CuriosTiger> but there are some seriously cool plates out there.

[10:03:11] <kurahaupo> How about plates shaped like a sidewinder snake? (a rounded sawtooth pattern)
[10:03:57] <kurahaupo> or like an octopus?

[21:09:52] <Bayes> thanks for the link huf
[21:11:11] <Bayes> msfninja that's not a bad guess I suppose though here in the US I think some do it one way and some the other, so it's still a local accent thing

[21:16:38] <Bayes> but from reading that Wikipedia link it seems your guess was good msfninja as they seem to state that the j (yod?) is typically dropped in the US
[21:17:19] <msfninja> it just happened i was watching some videos abt that
[21:18:02] <Bayes> heh cool
[21:19:58] <Bayes> I mean it's pretty funny because apparently the whole thing started to make the pronunciation easier by dropping the j in difficult contexts like chute. Then more cases keep popping up and by the end you end up with a rather complex rule
[21:20:24] <Bayes> they wanted to simplify the pronunciation by making it less regular 
[21:21:29] <Bayes> but the gist of the rule seems to be: keep the j if there's a syllable break, drop otherwise
[21:21:57] <huf> eh
[21:22:01] <huf> it's still there in beauty for most people
[21:22:47] <Bayes> keep in ve-nue, mat-thew, drop in new, suit, threw, etc
[21:23:54] <huf> ah yeah
[21:24:19] <msfninja> ion think theres a variant with the j for threw
[21:25:20] <Bayes> beauty yeah, also is it really dropped in tune (as in song) as Wikipedia suggests? 
[21:25:48] <Bayes> muted also? hmm 🤔
[21:26:54] <twb> Bayes: in some dialects there's no yod in "tune"
[21:27:43] <twb> So it sounds the same as in "cartoon"
[21:28:30] <Bayes> hm so would it be tune = toon in Midwestern AmE?
[21:28:50] <twb> I don't know about Americans.
[21:29:01] <Bayes> okay
[21:29:07] <huf> Bayes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes
[21:29:12] <huf> this only works if there's no yod

[22:06:53] <kurahaupo> Bayes: I've never heard the word "faculty" pronounced with /yu/ in the middle and I am reasonably familiar with most major dialects. However it's true that in some dialects, the single spelling "u" corresponds to two phoneme patterns, /u/ and /yu/, and like any homography, you just have to learn which apply to which words. That said, is rare for the /ku/ phonemes to occur is an unstressed position.
