[03:05:33] <CoJaBo> FWD
[03:05:49] <CoJaBo> I can't find anything about how replacing tires could fix cruise control
[03:06:20] <CoJaBo> It wasn't even remotely considered a possibility by any of the guides on troubleshooting it that I'd found
[03:06:30] <technonerd> they plugged in/ wiggled a speed sensor?
[03:06:45] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> Telgareith - then get out of bed
[03:06:54] <Telgareith> I am atm
[03:06:54] <CoJaBo> Speed sensor fault would trigger an engine or trac code
[03:07:10] <CoJaBo> 2008 Chrysler Sebring, cruise control has been broken since the start of the pandemic. Would disable itself almost immediately anytime it was engaged. No engine codes, and it wasn't the brake switch which is the only component of the cruise control system that can be replaced. I just got new tires, and they also replaced the TPMS sensors. I drove home, and the transmission wouldn't go into park, and said it was in 8th gear. I shifted thru all gears tryi
[03:07:20] <Telgareith> tires of such different diameter that cruse control thinks you're turning

[03:07:56] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> listen to the upbeat Jimmy Eat World songs and skip the downer ones
[03:07:56] <Telgareith> this would be left/right
[03:07:57] <monr0e> Are the new tyre sensors actually paired?
[03:08:17] <CoJaBo> They seem to be, as there's no TPMS light
[03:08:53] <monr0e> Steering sensor, throttle position sensor, camshaft position sensor, evap sensor? 
[03:09:16] <CoJaBo> All of those should have set codes if faulty
[03:09:38] <monr0e> not necessarily. Camshaft pos sensor can be hella out of wack before it triggers
[03:09:43] <CoJaBo> I know the evap sensors work for sure, because I apparently need a new gas cap
[03:10:27] <monr0e> You got a pid reader that can do live data? I'd be looking for accurate inputs
[03:10:28] <Telgareith> why do you assume your gas cap is faulty
[03:10:54] <CoJaBo> Telgareith: It sets a leak code sometimes after I get gas
[03:11:05] <monr0e> Sure you're not overfilling it?
[03:11:08] <CoJaBo> Nope
[03:11:26] <CoJaBo> The seal is dried out, so this isn't surprising; my old car did the same thing
[03:11:38] <CoJaBo> Dryrotted or whatever
[03:11:50] <monr0e> Oh, thats prolly reasonable. Petrol does nasty things to rubber
[03:12:02] <monr0e> or that ptfe stuff that they use these days
[03:12:37] <CoJaBo> Gas here has ethanol in it too
[03:13:10] <CoJaBo> It definitely works after the new tires tho, and was deifnitely failing before, so it seems improbable that it would be a random other sensor
[03:13:34] <monr0e> But if it says you're in 8th when you're in neutral, I'd be looking at the drivetrain. Clutch/torque sensors if you have them, gear position sensor, gearing itself, transmission fluid, all that stuff
[03:13:57] <monr0e> is it a daft flappy paddle or is it a proper stick?
[03:14:55] <CoJaBo> 4-speed automatic
[03:16:10] <Telgareith> I need to eat but can't bring myself to do so
[03:16:12] <CoJaBo> It bing stuck in 8th gear only happened til I shifted thru all the gearshift positions; once I did that, it went back to normal, and it would go into park again.
[03:16:23] <monr0e> Oh, a 2008 era automatic. That sounds painful.
[03:16:52] <Telgareith> what's wrong with 2008 era autos?
[03:16:54] <monr0e> tbf its old now. Prollyt some gremlins crept in over the years
[03:17:19] <CoJaBo> Prevailing speed in traffic jams precisely matches the shift point.
[03:18:17] <monr0e> Over here we don't really like automatic gearboxes. In those days they were heavy, stupid in traffic, and fell to pieces quicker than you could say jack. They're nto so bad today, but I still hate them myself. I don't want to pilot a computer, I want to *operate the machine*
[03:18:22] <CoJaBo> My guess is that it somehow got reset and lost its position reference somehow, so didn't know what gear it was in til I went thru them all. Tho I have no idea how it got reset, and how that fixed cruise contorl.
[03:20:05] <CoJaBo> I can confirm it is pretty annoying in slow traffic,it's constantly hunting; tho I can somewhat mitigate that by shifting into low

[03:22:40] <Telgareith> ...
[03:24:13] <Telgareith> isn't it literally pushing in the clutch, putting the stick in neutral and turning the key?
[03:24:39] <Telgareith> and I think the stick is optional, but ya gonna need first gear to go anywhere
[03:26:17] <CoJaBo> It was found in first gear, parking brake off, ignition on, key not present, battery dead
[03:26:50] <Telgareith> RIP starter
[03:27:06] <CoJaBo> We have no way to know what step they actually failed on, for all I know they either gave up or yeh, killed the battery

[08:02:13] <Kiernian|Work> One of the more annoying issues of software development is WHY that's the case, though. If it's standards changing, that's fine, for example...
[08:03:34] <CombatVet> Kiernian|Work, i think you missed my first statement, you literally joined 2 mins later after I posted it loll
[08:03:44] <CombatVet> but here: just random thoughts, so I was storing files to GCS Archive via rclone (encrypted), mostly documents and shit right, but i was thinking after I got done transferring all the files that what if rclone doesn't exist 10 years from now and doesn't get updated with GCS' API? Meaning those files uploaded are fucked and cannot be retrieved since it was encrypted by rclone
[08:03:47] <Kiernian|Work> I did, heh.
[08:04:08] <Kiernian|Work> yep, that's a serious and legitimate concern
[08:05:15] <CombatVet> i know having multiple copies is a must and the copies I have aren't locally encrypted, but i'm more concerned about the cloud part that's encrypted lol
[08:05:32] *** Quits: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[08:06:59] <CombatVet> i'm not saying rclone is going to shit 10 years from now, but you know, people get old and die, lose interests, apps become obselete, etc
[08:07:55] <Kiernian|Work> yeah. Honestly though, I started as a junior sysadmin 25 years ago and for my entire career there's been a need to locate, re-create, or later on spin up legacy OS's/Software for some reason or another
[08:08:18] <CombatVet> specially if it's opensource and not generating income to continue development
[08:09:00] <Kiernian|Work> yeah, that and vendors who went out of business were the most common
[08:09:13] <CombatVet> Kiernian|Work, you know where i'
[08:09:18] <CombatVet> Kiernian|Work, you know where i'mn coming from right
[08:09:27] <hunterkll> i mean
[08:09:32] <hunterkll> you just keep a copy of the relevant software
[08:09:47] <hunterkll> *shrug* I've helped fix Win95 machines for work because of data archival/storage needs
[08:09:48] <hunterkll> lol
[08:10:14] <Kiernian|Work> yes, absolutely. I recall a lot of panic being induced circa 2004 when "e-discovery" became a massive buzzword and places started getting rid of anything and everything older than x that didn't have a retention schedule.
[08:10:20] <hunterkll> obviously, you'd pull the data back however 
[08:10:33] <hunterkll> and use whatever copy of rclone you have saved to decrypt it
[08:10:36] <hunterkll> lol

[08:10:45] <Kiernian|Work> suddenly IT got a mandate to lose old data on file shares, etc. Lots of historical installers, etc
[08:10:48] <hunterkll> government contracting, lottta shit with crazy retention timelines
[08:11:09] <hunterkll> but email for almost all rank and file employees? 90 day retention policy
[08:11:12] <hunterkll> unless you manually archive it
[08:11:13] <hunterkll> lol
[08:11:40] <hunterkll> SOX, legalizing shredding of evidence since 2002
[08:12:11] <Kiernian|Work> did anyone actually implement it that early? One major corporation I worked for was still trying to figure it out three years after that
[08:12:43] <hunterkll> i mean, that's when it was put into law
[08:14:14] <hunterkll> Senator Sarbanes's bill passed the Senate Banking Committee on June 18, 2002, by a vote of 17 to 4. On June 25, 2002, WorldCom revealed it had overstated its earnings by more than $3.8 billion during the past five quarters (15 months), primarily by improperly accounting for its operating costs. Senator Sarbanes introduced Senate Bill 2673 to the full Senate that same day, and it passed 97–0 less than three week
[08:14:14] <hunterkll> s later on July 15, 2002.
[08:14:16] <hunterkll> lol

[08:17:01] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> What should he do?
[08:18:13] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> So the highlighted cells remain saved when he sends them to me
[08:18:14] <CombatVet> hunterkll, i got the 'making copies' part, but i was more focused on cloud/encryption/rclone part. it wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't encrypted obviously, i could easily right-click download or zip&download. But rclone being opensource, i guess the source code can be viewed and see how it encrypts/decrypts its files from GCS
[08:18:30] <Kiernian|Work> yeah, I just didn't know of any companies that were actually compliant until some time after that. I seem to recall them extending the compliance deadline a few times.
[08:18:48] <CombatVet> but if i remember correctly, encrypted files can be downloaded and encrypted locally instead of decrypting the files on the fly
[08:18:57] <CombatVet> my bad late reply lol
[08:19:03] <Kiernian|Work> lol, no worries
[08:19:35] <hunterkll> i mean, as long as you have a way to get it down, then it'll be fixable
[08:19:38] <hunterkll> doesn't even have to be open source
[08:19:48] <hunterkll> just need the tool, compatible OS environment, and a way to somehow get the data back
[08:19:56] <hunterkll> even if it's encrypted
[08:20:00] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> cl0udNinja
[08:20:01] <hunterkll> well, and the proper keys too :)
[08:21:09] <CombatVet> look at this, from another user: "I have files encrypted with rclone. Suppose that rclone is discontinued, or the encryption algorithm is updated, and I have files encrypted with old versions of the rclone."
[08:21:14] <CombatVet> i knew i wasn't the only one
[08:21:23] <hunterkll> then you use the old version
[08:21:26] <hunterkll> not exactly a big deal
[08:22:29] <CombatVet> you're right, i guess download encrypted files manually and decrypt manually using the version used during the encryption process
[08:22:46] <CombatVet> like i said, it was just a random thought i thought about earlier
[08:22:48] <hunterkll> not exactly rocket surgery 
[08:27:02] <hunterkll> because at the end of the day, that's the real scenario - not "will vendor/company/software be around in 10 years" but "in 10 years, will i be able to replicate this setup with what I already have right now and can store for future use"
[08:28:00] <hunterkll> always assume there won't be any outside help/support/etc

[08:50:52] <kerat58> calling general contractors, letting them know you have a strip club and some of the bigger ladies keep bustin' the floor joists and dislocating the poles, need someone over here ASAP to "sort it out"

[08:51:43] <kerat58> "I mean it is bad mate, really bad.  When Janet comes, forget about it.  The pole might as well be a spear because the whole thing is horizontal and chucked halfway across the room before we're even through the first song"

[13:55:50] <hunterkll> Reinhilde: that was a fun troubleshooting, I had MS and redhat engaged, and they eventually figured it out (redhat provided a temporary patch to increase stability) and dragged in dell to get their bios fixed

[13:58:18] <Reinhilde> i mean my desktop uses the motherboard from a HP Z440... HP's BIOS write protection seems to be as tight as a badger's behind - if you flash your own BIOS externally you brick the machine

[15:45:16] <Fossil> Question: I have a VPN which internally listens on port 51820, I have IPv4 NAT'ed WAN port 53 to this. Works fine. How does this work over IPv6? I have 80,443 working fine over v6 with a Firewall Ingress rule. Is there any way to "translate" the port frokm 51820 to 53 with IPv6?

[15:55:05] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Use nat64
[15:56:31] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Or nat the ULA's
[15:58:06] <Fossil> Yeah ok. So no "easy" solution. I could do something funky with IPtables on my firewall (Edgerouter) but dont really want to add something that isnt in the config file
[15:58:38] *** Seto_Kaiba is now known as Hunterkll
[15:58:41] <Hunterkll> it works the same way
[15:58:55] <Hunterkll> take your IPv6 WAN address, and do the same rule as IPv4
[15:59:03] <Hunterkll> just v6 to v6 instead of v4 to v4 
[15:59:34] <Hunterkll> you need actual end to end ipv6 connectivity to do anything Fossil 
[16:00:14] <Hunterkll> do not think of it as different
[16:00:16] <Hunterkll> it's the same
[16:00:45] <Hunterkll> the mechanics don't change, just the address format
[16:01:06] <Fossil> Ill mess wit hit some more. The server has its own IPv6 from my provider assigned /64
[16:01:17] <Hunterkll> cool so just use that
[16:01:31] <Hunterkll> that means you have a bajillion IPs to assign to stuff if it's a /64 
[16:02:07] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> You usually get a /48 or 56
[16:02:10] <Fossil> Yeah but how would I make external port 53 go to internal port 51820 without NAT. From what I have seen theres no real NAT
[16:02:19] <Hunterkll> there is
[16:02:21] <Hunterkll> unfortunately
[16:02:26] <Hunterkll> NAT66 is a thing
[16:02:35] <Hunterkll> i fucking wish it wasn't, but still
[16:02:39] <Fossil> hehe
[16:02:49] <Hunterkll> it took 10 years for it to be accepted
[16:02:53] <Hunterkll> because of how bad an idea it is
[16:03:00] <Hunterkll> port redirection is an option though 
[16:03:17] <Hunterkll> @mitchy93 a /48 or /56 if we're talking full networks/ISPs/etc not a single server
[16:03:25] <Hunterkll> single server only gets /64
[16:03:44] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Yup

[16:04:16] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Chunk it to /64
[16:04:50] <Fossil> Just a thought. Maybe I'll give the server a second IPv6 addr, then set the AAAA record to that one and have the VPN listen on that v6 addr only
[16:05:04] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> Or just use a firewall and install fail2ban on your server

[16:36:06] <fritzwastaken> Good morning ladies
[16:36:10] <monr0e> Reinhilde: Definitely a shell. Look at their balance sheet for 2020, no investment arm operates with just 400k liquid capital.

[16:37:25] <bomb> how do you see a private company's liquid capital?
[16:37:39] <monr0e> Company accounts in the UK are public
[16:37:45] <monr0e> they are listed on Companies House
[16:38:25] <bomb> hmm that's a privacy concern
[16:38:26] <monr0e> And most companies, incidentally, are either sole traders or public limited companies. Some are "private limited" which is slightly different, but they still have to list
[16:38:51] <monr0e> Not really, its intended to be a solution to taxation transparency.

[16:53:19] <fritzwastaken> Theres value in you

[16:54:15] <fritzwastaken> it got awkward
[16:54:24] <bomb> monr0e do you run an LLC?
[16:55:04] <monr0e> No, I run a Private Limited Company. It's wrapped up at the moment and I'm trading purely as myself. Once I have Meridian up and running, I'll open up shop again

[17:29:29] <JollyRgrs> @Killnine honestly it depends on how you have the vswitch setup
[17:30:58] <JollyRgrs> if you did nothing, then it is prob on a 172.16 network that is double-NATed (using your local machihne as a gateway). but you can also setup the NIC in bridged mode so it gets its own IP the same way your laptop does
[17:31:19] <JollyRgrs> don't overcomplicate it, just view it as 2 devices on a network and figure out why they can't talk to each other

[17:45:46] <signofzeta> Hyper-V - If you used a Private v-switch, then you can't communicate with the host with it.  Use Internal instead.  Otherwise, an External switch is a normal one.

[23:04:00] <PattyCakes> look, at the end of the day this isn't my company. I have people I report to
[23:04:01] <csws> the fat client requires DB credentials in the .config file and I guess someone realised that someone could just... y'know.. open the .config file in notepad and get the password
[23:04:03] <csws> so they "encrypted it"
[23:04:06] <PattyCakes> I liek my paycheck more than your personal information
[23:04:13] <PattyCakes> because I'm not liable when the company fails to protect it
[23:04:33] <csws> using some proprietary algorithm with a static key hardcoded that you could easily get by.. idk.. decompiling the app (it was VB.NET)
[23:04:45] <csws> I think they even shipped it with the pdb files to make that extra easy
[23:04:56] <PattyCakes> literally am the nightmare of auditors, a true "yes man"
