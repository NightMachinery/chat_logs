[00:04:09] <berber> :)
[00:04:19] <berber> so idk if this is the right place to ask
[00:05:05] <berber> but i am wondering how it might be possible to configure nyxt in a way that it will be super paranoid regarding privacy
[00:05:50] <berber> like there are many user.js configs for firefox that disable a lot of functionality for privacy reasons.
[00:08:46] <berber> i hope that in the future there will be a privacy focused community that tweak nyxt in this way.  i think this will happen once firefox addon support is added, which apparently is on the roadmap for nyxt (and which is a really good idea, i personally think the userbase will grow quite rapidly once that happens)
[00:09:31] <waleee> there's some of the usual suspects in nyxt (eg no-script-mode, blocker-mode for basic hostbased adblocking, force-hhtps-mode, nosave-buffers aka incognito/private windows in firefox/chrome)
[00:11:46] <waleee> and aartaka is working on a branch that enables the usage of firefox/chrome-webextensions in nyxt, which would open up for the usage of privacy-enhancing extensions from that ecosystem
[00:13:12] <aartaka> waleee: Pierre is also merging named contexts, which are like Firefox Containers, yet more generic.
[00:13:39] <waleee> nice :) I hadn't seen that PR
[00:14:59] <waleee> berber: but there isn't a comprehensive guide to follow atm on how to get the most privacy out of nyxt
[00:15:48] <aartaka> I wonder if I should do one, sounds like a useful promo...
[00:17:17] <waleee> berber: ah, you mentioned the webextensions work, my bad :)

[14:54:26] <berber> jmercouris haha people always talk about the ethnic tribe berber when they hear my name, but it\s unrelated
[14:54:35] <berber> age of empires ii included
[14:54:36] <berber> haha
[14:56:39] <berber> aartaka:  i am no expert in the field of promo or whatever, but i believe a comprehensive guide to get the most privacy out of nyxt is pretty good promo
[14:57:27] <berber> it could just be some markdown file on some github that explains everything, and just have a github repo with your config or whatever.  or a file that can be imported etc.

[18:18:00] <berber> lol
[18:19:38] <lagash> oh and just to be safe, disable JS! :P
[20:16:43] <jmercouris> Such an article may be good to write

[23:49:54] <aartaka> lagash: I thought about making a user script altering JS objects, which should lessen the fingerprint of Nyxt. There are also some WebKit settings that we don't utilize yet.
