[15:41:54] <GodEater> :D
[15:42:32] <GodEater> if your apache is running as a https proxy (i.e. you have to connect to it via https, not http), then the mod_ssl would matter right?
[15:42:57] <GodEater> so your client would have to speak the same TLS version as the proxy, and the same as the thing at the far end?

[16:09:57] <bagder> GodEater: then it matters for that TLS-to-the-proxy connection yes, it would still relay the TLS within the "tunnel" that is sent to the server, as that's just what the client uses
[16:12:17] <GodEater> I'm just wondering what would happen when you a mismatch of versions between what the proxy supports, and what the ultimate end point supports
[16:13:29] <GodEater> we are trying to get this to work: <crappy old client>→<crappy old apache mod proxy which only speaks TLS 1.0>→<fancy upgraded service which only speaks TLS1.2+> 
[16:13:51] <bagder> since they're two separate TLSes, it *should* work fine
[16:14:12] <GodEater> assuming we can get crappy old client upgraded to allow it to talk TLS1.2+ ?
[16:14:32] <bagder> right, that might be a challenge
[16:14:47] <GodEater> well, in the last five minutes it's turned out to be less of a challenge than I thought
[16:15:19] <GodEater> I thought the crappy old client was a binary - but it turns out it's a shell script calling the OS curl - (which is very old), but we can at least update the script to point to a shiny new curl as supplied by moparisthebest :)
[16:15:39] <GodEater> so I think we should be ok
[16:15:58] <GodEater> the next challenge is how to get said shiny new curl and somewhat patched shell script out to all the servers it is installed on
[16:16:04] <GodEater> but that's my problem :D

[18:08:44] <bagder> wow

[18:09:03] <GodEater> although I *mostly* deal with RHEL5-5 / RHEL-6
[18:09:09] <bagder> I provide support for a modern curl on a RHEL7 for a customer who wants modern TLS but doesn't want to upgrade RHEL...
[18:09:20] <moparisthebest> My condolences... I think we only have a couple rhel5 now, though mostly 6
[18:09:24] <GodEater> RHEL-7 is the most modern one we have

[18:10:06] <moparisthebest> I'm testing our app on rhel8 now but we are always a decade ahead of the rest of the company
[18:10:13] <GodEater> because we're chronically understaffed and short of budget
[18:11:26] <GodEater> another fun old RHEL issue is being asked "can you please upgrade the Hashicorp stuff" and having to say "no, because anything later than version X of that is compiled with a version of golang which produces binaries that won't run on kernels that old"
[18:12:05] <GodEater> the fact that it ran there in the first place is a happy accident, because according to the offical golang docs, the RHEL5 kernels are too old to support golang binaries AT ALL.

[18:19:41] <moparisthebest> GodEater: our application runs in a container specifically to avoid ancient redhat issues (we don't control the base os) but recently we couldn't upgrade the software in the container because... Newer glibc requires a newer kernel :'(
[18:19:47] <Piru> you can often mitigate the risk somewhat by properly isolating the systems and having proper monitoring. but it gets really hard to deal with any kind of issues
[18:19:59] *** Joins: gunhu (~gunhu@2a0e:e701:1138::1)
[18:20:21] <GodEater> moparisthebest: what sort of container? As in docker? Or some custom thing (which is not unheard of)
[18:20:52] <Piru> at some stage it really gets much more expensive to deal with the issues than to go something more modern. the longer you wait the more expensive it gets, plus harder it will become to finally migrate
[18:21:25] <GodEater> mort: it's probably not as bad as it sounds, as RedHat do backport a lot of stuff into their kernels - but yes, it's not great.
[18:22:09] <mort> I wouldn't trust any organization to back-port every single security fix (even if the fix isn't marked as such) from the last 10 years to 2.6
[18:22:34] <GodEater> I don't think they claim to do *every* fix
[18:22:34] <Piru> this is a classic technical debt evaluation thing: it may seem more expensive to migrate in a short term, but in the end it'd be a lot cheaper to do it
[18:22:49] <mort> well, they would need to back-port every security-related fix if they wanted it to be safe, right?
[18:22:59] <GodEater> it's also classic banking technology. 
[18:23:27] <bagder> not all security problems are equal though
[18:23:43] <GodEater> mort: yes - I'm agreeing with you. It's not great. I'm just saying it's not a vanilla 2.6 kernel is all.
[18:23:57] <mort> I imagine there's a ton of small bug fixes which aren't intended to fix anything with security implications, but which happen to fix an undiscovered exploitable issue
[18:24:12] <Piru> it's often also something a single project or project manager can't afford. it has to come from above and have good backing. hence the issue that many organisations have with running anchient stuff
[18:24:54] <Piru> I'm sure you've all seen that in some form or another over the years
[18:26:37] <mort> yea
[18:26:38] <Piru> everything is cost-benefit. if you can't easily explain what the benefits are nothing will be done
[18:26:47] <moparisthebest> GodEater: yea docker, or podman on rhel8
[18:27:03] <mort> it also doesn't help that software (including linux) breaks compatibility all the bloody time so every single upgrade of anything is a huge risk and possibly a giant pita
[18:27:16] <moparisthebest> I just hadn't realized glibc upgrades could prevent us from running some of those until it hit :/
[18:27:49] <Piru> we actually created a risk analysis tool that can be used to estimate these things.. gives some nice statistic graps with likely minimums and maximums. works on many "unpredictable" things such as security incidents and such
[18:27:59] <Piru> graphs
[18:28:20] <mort> how do you do that? Do you manually input minimums and maximums for stuff?
[18:28:27] <mort> determining a maximum for an upgrade seems very difficult
