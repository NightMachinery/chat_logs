[02:29:39] <rb> if your fork gets distinct enough you can request an "unforking" from github

[02:45:44] <rb> well your project is independent from the other thing you could use 1.0
[02:45:54] <rb> but i'd say it's a case by case basis
[02:46:13] <rb> for instance, mariadb went with mysql versioning scheme for a while before bumping to version 10 to make it distinct from mysql
[02:46:23] <rb> you could also bump a major version like that

[23:24:30] <epilys> zbrown[m], why not your own?
[23:24:45] <JordiGH> Well, to be fair, some companies also didn't even track their scope 3 very well.
[23:24:57] <JordiGH> I really wish Amazon reported any of this.
[23:25:18] <imode> it'd hurt profit.
[23:25:34] <imode> so it won't be reported.
[23:26:09] <JordiGH> Does it? Google has really good reporting.
[23:26:42] <zbrown[m]> epilys: I'm not wild about running my own server for this. I could technically use creds for my hosted paid email account but not sure if that would violate ToS given the server lives in Digital Ocean

[23:29:35] <JordiGH> imode: Scope 3 emissions means you don't run the delivery fleets, someone else does. If you're the one who owns the delivery fleets, that would be your scope 1 emissions.
[23:29:58] <JordiGH> Scope 1 = stuff you're responsible for. Scope 2 = electricity. Scope 3 = emissions another company has incurred on your behalf.

[23:31:40] <JordiGH> imode: It definitely matters, because you can't just add up all the emissions reported by each company as that severely double-counts.

[23:33:01] <imode> what I mean is.. it's emissions. why does it matter if someone else has incurred it on your behalf, your behavior should be "we need to stop doing that". but you won't. because profit.

[23:44:09] <Teckla> Therefore, if you use Python or Ruby, you are bad, and should feel bad.  And if you use heavyweight JavaScript frameworks, again, you are bad, and should feel bad.  All that carbon wasted on inefficient languages and language implementations!

[23:47:59] <drobilla> In my highly cynical experience, companies will reluctantly care about performance some time after it's so unusably horrible that their customers will leave over it.  Any time before that, caring about it seems to end up in the same box as sorting includes or whatever other programmer bullshit.  It's very frustrating
