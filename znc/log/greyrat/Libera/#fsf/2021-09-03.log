[21:41:33] <adfeno> Hi there ;)
[21:41:34] <user9> craigt: In the interest of not duplicating efforts, is there any way to indicate a 'last updated date' for any particular field or attribute such as Accepts Crypto Donations? I could narrow my work down a lot just knowing when was the last time a particular field was updated. Also, if there was such a field, then with every entry I check on, I would update that entry even if nothing changes, just to indicate
[21:41:36] <user9> that field was check to be accurate on that date. Does that make sense?

[21:51:34] <kreyren[m]> For those who wanted me to address this issue https://freespeech.firedragonstudios.com/web/statuses/106868877394207676
[21:51:50] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[21:52:19] <user9> craigt: in that case, if I go and check a project and the FSD is correct, what would be the best way to update the 'last updated time' just to say that it was verified on that date and is correct?
[21:52:21] <craigt> kreyren[m]: Hi there! Welcome to this week's Free Software Directory meeting.
[21:52:58] <xof> Hello World

[21:53:09] <kreyren[m]> oh hey~ Don't you have those way too often by now
[21:53:29] <craigt> user9: Hm..
[21:53:39] * kreyren[m] just came here to collect political points from people who support his for-FLOSS politics in the EU
[21:54:05] <craigt> xof: Hello. Welcome to the FSD meeting.
[21:55:06] * kreyren[m] was hoping for headpats and is now sad and leaves
[21:57:23] <user9> craigt: maybe it's not valuable enough for the time it would take. But it could be very helpful considering the large number of projects to be updated, and the possible transient nature of contributions.

[22:22:45] <craigt> kreyren[m]: Thank you. 
[22:22:45] <user9> craigt: definitely would be for any field. Even if the field doesn't change it would be nice to be able to say that field was verified to be correct on a particular date
[22:23:03] *** Quits: KUrare (~KUrare@user/kurare) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[22:23:23] <kreyren[m]> craigt: Ideally if you could share this around FSF? he needs around 20 votes to help me with a full FLOSS migration of the party

[22:26:53] <craigt> kreyren[m]: We are having the FSD meeting,  but then again, that is probably the best time to advertise. Thank you for keeping it brief.

[22:33:42] <craigt> kreyren[m]: A lot of news/Information flows through the campaigns team. If it is free software related, someone will check it out and decide what to do with it.
[22:36:04] <kreyren[m]> craigt: ok i get back to you about that
[22:36:42] <craigt> We are into hour three of this week's Free Software Directory Meeting. If you are new or just want a refresher, check out the participation guidelines. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate We also have the directory-discuss mailing list which you can sign up for at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/directory-discuss
[22:40:49] <craigt> xof: My guess is the eID team is new and under development. If you are looking for a contact, check the history and find what user created the page(and reach out to them).
[22:42:01] <xof> craigt: Will do. Thanks a million.

[22:54:34] <craigt> kreyren[m]: If it is about free software, I think it is realistic, but the world is a little too complicated for a yes/no answer. That's why we have the campaigns team. The brains of the operation (or at least the frontal lobe).

[23:03:21] <user9> craigt: sure thing
[23:04:00] <user9> craigt: I did notice the 'last revised date' that is actually very helpful but what I will describe is that it would be nice to have a 'last revised date' for each field
[23:05:52] <xx> I only just found out - nmap is no longer foss?
[23:05:56] <craigt> user9: Even with my limited understanding of Mediawiki, the idea sounds doable. I just don't know what is involved, but it will effect every entry which is always a big deal.
[23:07:12] <craigt> xx: Welcome to this week's Free Software Directory meeting. (only 23 minutes to go :)
[23:07:34] <xx> craigt: is it happening on this network?
[23:08:49] <craigt> xx: We set the nmap directory entry to 'under review' while the nmap's community works it out. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Nmap
[23:09:54] <craigt> xx: Every Friday 12:00-15:00 EST in #fsf, we host the Free Software Directory meeting to work on the Directory https://directory.fsf.org
