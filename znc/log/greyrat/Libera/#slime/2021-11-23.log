[12:20:21] <chrnybo> Hi, I'm still using 8-bit characters, and would prefer that most of the windows-1252 characters in the range decimal 128-159/ hex 80-9F be displayed, as in a charitable interpretation of latin-1.  Is it reasonable to expect (code-char 128) to result in a euro sign?  
[12:23:52] <chrnybo> Talking to a remote lw 7.1 from emacs 27.2 with slime 2.26, (code-char 128) returns #\U+0080.  (char "€" 0) returns #\€, and (char-code (char "€" 0)) returns 8364, its unicode code point.
[13:20:55] <pjb> chrnybo: emacs supports windows-1252, so why not just configure it as such?
[13:22:39] <pjb> chrnybo: why don't you get 63 for (char-code (char "?" 0)) ?
[13:26:47] <pjb> Oh, I see: slime rejects it: Invalid slime-net-coding-system: windows-1252. (iso-latin-1-unix iso-8859-1-unix binary utf-8-unix emacs-mule-unix euc-jp-unix)
[13:27:09] <pjb> I think slime should be patched to support more encodings…
[13:28:42] <pjb> chrnybo: if you want to use the euro sign, you need Latin-9 aka iso-8859-15 https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/CEI_8859-15
[13:29:56] <pjb> (so I guess one of the ? I have above is an euro sign actually).
[13:30:32] <chrnybo> Yes, it was meant to be a euro sign.
[13:30:59] <pjb> (I'm currently in a non-utf-8 terminal)
[13:33:19] <pjb> In iso-8859-1, 80-9f are control codes.  There's no support to substitute codes in the lisp <-> swank <-> slime <-> emacs chain, apart from those encodings supported by slime.
[13:33:57] <pjb> so the only solution you have, to transport the euro sign safely, is to use one of the two encodings that have it: utf-8-unix or emacs-mule-unix.
[13:34:02] <pjb> In practice, utf-8.
[13:34:35] <chrnybo> pjb: "In iso-8859-1, 80-9f are control codes", yeah, sorta.
[13:34:54] <pjb> This should not prevent your lisp to work with 8-bit character type, using the windows-1252 encoding, as long as it's able to convert to the :external-format :utf-8 when talking to slime.
[13:37:10] <pjb> Not sorta, definitely: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/CEI_8859-1#ISO/CEI_8859-1_par_rapport_ÃÂ _ISO-8859-1
[13:37:28] <pjb> 80 = PAD, 81 = HOP, etc…
[13:48:25] <chrnybo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1ISO-8859-1 [...] most declared single-byte character encoding in the world on the web, but as web browsers interpret it as the superset Windows-1252 the documents may include characters from that set.
[13:49:16] <chrnybo> But then again, if I can't be bothered to read French, I'll never learn anything.
[13:50:25] <chrnybo> Sorry, botched the English wikipedia reference, it should have been https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1
[14:03:12] <pjb> Just look at the table.
[14:04:09] <pjb> But anyways, the only solution I see, is to configure swank/slime/emacs to use utf-8, and lispworks can still use windows-1252, but use :utf-8 as external-format in swank.
[14:17:11] <chrnybo> Thanks, although I doubt my linux lispworks has any notion of windows-1252.
[14:44:04] <pjb> chrnybo: oh, then why do you want to use windows-1252?
[14:44:11] <pjb> Just use iso-8859-15
[14:44:31] <pjb> (and utf-8 in swank/slime/emacs)
[14:47:25] <pjb> chrnybo: otherwise, if it's just for the euro sign, in iso-8859-1 there's the currency sign; you could use that instead.
[15:04:18] <chrnybo> I wanted windows-1252 to liberally accept input from the web with the 80-9f characters.  Comparing the english and french wikipedia pages on iso-8859-1 I imagine Macron vs. Johnson, both dressed and groomed for a day at the office.
