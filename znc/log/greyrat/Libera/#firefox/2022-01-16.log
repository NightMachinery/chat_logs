[04:48:45] <dalias> susi_, the only way android firefox lets you install extensions
[04:49:04] <dalias> gh555222, no, what is it?
[04:49:08] <dalias> mobile firefox fork?
[04:50:20] <gh555222> Waterfox is a variant code base based on firefox's, with support for many more legacy technologies such as NPAPI
[04:50:50] <dalias> it doesn't sound like it's mobile
[04:50:55] <dalias> and i do not want npapi
[04:51:12] <dalias> that was one of the few things firefox was right to nuke
[04:51:53] <gh555222> dalias: wrong, NPAPI is important for supporting some legacy solutions
[04:52:03] <gh555222> users can just choose not to install NPAPI extensions
[04:52:19] <gh555222> there comes a point when no matter how much damage happens to a user, its the user's own fault for negligence
[04:53:24] <dalias> i'm not going to argue about this shit. i have never in my life wanted an npapi extension. their existence only did me harm
[04:53:41] <dalias> by denying me access to sites that wanted me to install vulnerable proprietary native code shit to access them
[04:53:47] <gh555222> dalias: there is nothing wrong with you choosing not to use NPAPI extensions
[04:54:06] <dalias> there was something wrong with them being available because ppl made sites that needed them
[04:54:32] <gh555222> dalias: guess what, some of my services, require you to install an EXE, HAHA
[04:54:40] <gh555222> and they need Admin access
[04:54:41] <dalias> anyway this is just making me angry because i'm already pissed that firefox is doing wrong anti-user stuff and i don't need to be told that websites doing that was a good thing too
[04:54:51] <gh555222> or you cant use some of my sites!!
[04:54:53] <dalias> guess what, i don't use your services
[04:55:33] <gh555222> anyway, my bigger point is, there comes a point when the users must think for themselves, and maybe even fork a code base, to make development decisions that better serve their own interests
[04:55:49] <gh555222> you are no slave to firefox, you can fork it just like everyone else
[04:55:51] <dalias> yes and that's a completely different issue
[04:55:54] <dalias> lol
[04:55:58] <dalias> shut up already
[04:56:07] <gh555222> would you like help forking firefox?
[04:56:08] <dalias> your waterfox recommendation has nothing to do with my problem
[04:56:11] <dalias> no
[04:56:22] <dalias> which is MOBILE firefox being intentionally nerfed for ridiculous reasons
[04:56:32] <dalias> and you propose a useless fork of desktop firefox
[04:56:33] <gh555222> it does, waterfox has a different group of developers then firefox (to a point, remember its based on firefox's code base)
[04:56:44] <gh555222> is mobile firefox not open source?
[04:57:02] <dalias> are you intentionally dense??
[04:57:10] <dalias> for practical purposes no it's not
[04:57:22] <gh555222> dont download if you dont trust it, but to disprove your point: https://m.apkpure.com/waterfox-web-browser-open-free-and-private/org.waterfoxproject.waterfox
[04:57:35] <gh555222> waterfox, apk, for android
[04:57:41] <dalias> a program that's too intentionally complex for someone to maintain their own fork and keep up with necessary security fixes, etc. is effectively not open source
[04:58:04] <gh555222> dalias: you see, you fail to see that if you want conveinience, you will compromise some security
[04:58:07] <dalias> ok well it's not on play and a web search didn't turn up anything about it being on android
[04:58:12] <gh555222> they are 2 inversely proportional concepts
[04:58:12] <dalias> no
[04:58:25] <dalias> you fail to see that talking to me like i'm an idiot makes me mad
[04:58:32] <dalias> and that you are not telling me anything i don't know
[04:58:38] <gh555222> you are not an idiot, but humanity is full of idiots
[04:58:45] <dalias> you're telling me stuff i specifically disagree with and have for the past 3+ decades
[04:58:55] <dalias> for good reason
[04:59:05] <dalias> and pretending it's new facts i don't know
[04:59:07] <dalias> and it's fucking annoying
[04:59:36] <gh555222> well, if come on IRC just to complain, without developing a constuctful solution, except people like me to visit uninvited
[04:59:42] <dalias> ok so waterfox is not in play or f-droid and i've never heard of it before. so i'm probably not going to trust it.
[05:00:02] <gh555222> we are a community, come with a tangible problem, willing to accept support for a tangible solution to your problem
[05:00:33] <dalias> the problem i want to solve is how to get xpi's into a well-trusted mobile firefox
[05:00:42] <dalias> and surely there is some way
[05:01:30] <dalias> if nothing else, installing a mitm cert and hijacking addons.mozilla.org to a local httpd serving whatever xpi i want :-p
[05:04:07] <gh555222> I do like https://mitmproxy.org/ for that sort of thing

[20:03:29] <Enissay> I am using a mobile version of FF. Sometimes I open it after weeks of inactivity which causes a cumulation of many updates. Is there a way to make these updates go fast ? I already activated auto-update, but I still need to go to `Help > About` to check each time and trigger the update, then reboot & repeat.
[20:03:31] <Enissay> I actually have many instances like this which makes the whole update process a nightmare. Please advise if anyway to improve this
