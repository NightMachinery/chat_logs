[00:12:29] <spxtr> if gwern.net does something absurd with html/css/js then I have a good chuckle: it's cute and fun. when the rest of the web does it I rage.
[00:13:45] <quanticle> When gwern.net does something absurd with JS, it's for a good reason. There's at least some functionality there
[00:13:54] <quanticle> MDN is delivering *zero* additional functionality

[00:16:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, it's bad

[01:05:53] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/Screenshot_20220304-125014.png I have to mention again, I still cannot get used to or like these cattywompus return arrows splayed slovenly (even, slatternly) across the blockquote edge. please, can't we align them to the inside corner instead

[01:06:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: ... why is the arrow so weird
[01:06:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would look better if it was correct!
[01:06:53] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the dotted box would still be a slattern of geometry!
[01:06:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> no.
[01:07:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: As for the page, it's because .page isn't listed as one of the code file extensions in extracts-content.js
[01:07:48] <gwern> yes, but the raw text would be ugly which is probably why I excluded it. but I just checked and pandoc/sklighting *do* syntax highlight markdown which ought to fix that

[01:08:05] <gwern> well, we'll see
[01:08:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still gotta add it to that list I think
[01:08:14] <gwern> I did
[01:08:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> k.
[01:08:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll fix the arrow
[01:08:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Later
[01:08:44] <gwern> but anyway, hasn't the dotted-box always been aligned across the edge like this?
[01:08:55] <gwern> I am pretty sure we've argued about this. I've never liked it
[01:10:05] <gwern> I mean, does the arrow look better on desktop chromium? https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-1647207433507034.png yes. but the box is still putting me on edge

[01:43:15] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: some sort of injection

[02:53:43] <gwern> yes. hm. the relayout is not great. instead of doing the equivalent of display:none, can we just render them like, 0 opacity or somethiing?
[02:54:44] <gwern> does this implement the end-of-page termination?
[02:54:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> No auto-termination yet, no
[02:55:29] <gwern> yeah, didn't see any relevant code. ok, my initial impression is that the jerkiness aside, this does feel pretty cool
[02:55:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can we render them at 0 opacity (or, better, `visibility:hidden`): we of course can, but it looks super weird and "obviously shenanigans"
[02:55:41] <gwern> even having written it, I do feel like swapping between the views is kinda shocking

[02:58:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Amusingly, they're not even font "choices", they're font "abdications of choice"

[02:59:55] <PlanckWalk> An odd number, I hope
[03:00:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: We'll be lucky if it's an integer
[03:00:18] <saturn2> i assume you guys aren't seeing what i'm seeing
[03:00:18] <PlanckWalk> Heh
[03:00:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well, screenshot, I guess
[03:00:27] <quanticle> saturn2: What are you seeing?
[03:00:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (inb4 saturn2 posts a screenshot of MDN viewed in Wayback Machine)
[03:03:03] <PlanckWalk> One bit I like is if you wheel-scroll the sidebar and reach the end, it scrolls the main page.  What's more, it *stops* being able to scroll the sidebar anymore!
[03:03:13] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: can you give the prototype 'reader mode' a try on /Clippy and see which version feels more effective? https://pastebin.com/NHUuEgVt  https://share.obormot.net/textfiles/Q04IHrzd

[03:03:20] <PlanckWalk> (Unless you then hit the opposite end of the page)
[03:04:20] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I feel weakly inclined that the whitespace 'shenanigans' may actually be a good thing as a subtle hint to the reader that reader-mode has removed something, should they wish to investigate
[03:04:27] <PlanckWalk> Actually that's not quite true.  Sometimes it picks up scrolling the sidebar again.  Apparently at random.
[03:04:45] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: ...possibly fill in the whitespace with something extremely unotrusive, like an underline?
[03:04:59] <quanticle> Have you encountered the issue where it uses a bunch of CPU?
[03:05:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: An underline is not unobtrusive...
[03:05:03] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: a typographic equivalent of 'this page left intentionally blank'
[03:05:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's nothing we can fill in that'll be unobtrusive
[03:05:33] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: well, the dotted-underline? that is less obtrusive and why we picked it for WP
[03:06:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not less obtrusive than nothing
[03:06:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> If we're gonna go with whitespace, we better leave it whitespace

[03:34:29] <Robomot> Just Say No to CBDCs - by N.S. Lyons - The Upheaval (A Central Bank Digital Currency would enable a totalitarian nightmare)
[03:35:15] <gwern> quanticle: no. you can put bitcoin through loads of laundering methods and do off-chain transactions like lightning etc, and ethereum has long hosted many zero-knowledge tokens/mixers as well as a ridiculously complex ecosystem around it
[03:36:34] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[03:36:43] <two2thehead> huh til
[03:37:15] <two2thehead> it's almost as though the govt complaints about cryptocurrency being used disproportionately for money laundering is accurate
[03:37:41] <quanticle> "Meanwhile converting dollars into Euros, for example, would be slightly more complex, but just require a pre-existing agreement between the Fed and the European Central Bank to allow this. Of course, if either party did not want you to be able to exchange your money, you’d be out of luck." <-- But isn't that just as true today? If you convert Euros to US Dollars without the blessings of the
[03:37:43] <quanticle> government that is money laundering and if you get caught you go to jail
[03:37:51] <gwern> not to mention that a lot of the knobs a CBDC would enable and he uses in his scenarios would be a lot harder or impossible if it was 'just bitcoin'. for example, the 'spend before 7 days' - how would you actually do that in bitcoin? you can nlocktime things for 7 days, but that's the opposite of what you want; you can do 1-of-2 escrow and maybe yank an address's funds away after 7 days......
[03:37:57] <gwern> ...except that's trivially cheated by the recipient simply 'paying' it to another account, and you can't enforce it goes to a whitelist of addresses either
[03:38:21] <quanticle> Right, because people can set up ephemeral wallets, etc
[03:39:12] <gwern> so you'd have to do something like, I dunno, have a non-code-enforced agreement that 'you *will* spend it before 7 days or repay it to us and also only ever send it to a whitelist of verified merchants or else we will get mad and prosecute you or something'
[03:39:36] <gwern> which is obviously way less easy than having a little sql script which sets the field to '0' after 7 days
[03:42:26] <gwern> some of these you can imagine workarounds for (want to penalize white men? just send them less, or send everyone else more) but the more you want to do the more it collapses under its own weight, rather than always being practically free
[03:48:46] <ardent[m]> The three concerning things I find most likely to happen with it are (in descending order of likelihood) 1. negative interest rates, 2. immediate civil asset forfeiture, surveillance, and other law enforcement, and 3. quadratic, income-dependent, or otherwise nonlinear vice taxation / automated cap-and-trade. (Social credit is a distant fourth, and the rest of this stuff seems unlikely)
[03:49:47] <gwern> eh. once you have Google Shopping nagging you to shop at 'Black-owned businesses' and there are tons of 'buy minority' laws already on the books...
[03:50:18] <gwern> (with periodic scandals when it turns out that they are ripping off the government while perhaps not being quite as 'minority-owned' as they swear to on the paperwork)
[03:50:57] <ardent[m]> to elaborate on the broad category of number 3, it's basically "more perfect deterrence taxation in a way currently impossible due to the fungibility of currency"
[03:51:37] <gwern> 'deterrence'?
[03:51:56] <ardent[m]> a tax intended to make people do something less rather than intended as a money source
[03:52:56] <ardent[m]> things like a tax-free gas allowance followed by tiering, or gas tax that's a percent of your income, would be more in line with this
[03:53:48] <ardent[m]> that category is number 3 and not 2 in likelihood because law enforcement seems pretty likely, and also such taxes at the federal level may currently be unconstitutional
[03:54:10] <ardent[m]> (since the 16th only authorizes taxing income)
[03:54:16] <gwern> haha since when did that ever matter
[03:54:20] <ardent[m]> valid
[03:54:32] <quanticle> Also federal taxes are totally constitutional
[03:55:05] <gwern> I see you appear to have stepped through a time machine from the year 1900. we have so many things to explain to you about american progress computers, waifus, going to the moon, and exciting constitutional breakthroughs like the elastic clause

Or would people miss the point and only read the link-less version and not bother with the referenced version?)
[04:32:03] <gwern> quanticle: you'd be using it on /Clippy by default because it would be a special-case
[04:33:47] <saturn2> i've always thought the link styling with icons and lines going every which way was over-the-top so i might not be the best judge
[04:34:36] <gwern> saturn2: sure, but that still leaves open the best way to remove them, unless your point is that you would never be flipping back into regular mode and so would always choose display:none and are uninformative to ask
[04:35:06] <Betawolf> the mouseover recreating the links seems suboptimal, I could just go back to the non-reader version for that
[04:35:19] <gwern> how?
[04:36:14] <Betawolf> I mean, if I'm in 'reader mode' I wouldn't want the links, and if I want the links I would not be in 'reader mode'.
[04:37:12] <Betawolf> visually the version without the spaces seems better, but I'm thinking of this given the above no-mouseover thing
[04:38:07] <gwern> that seems like a rather harsh dichotomy. if you're in reader mode you'd *never* want links until you moved out of reader mode permanently?
[04:39:36] <Betawolf> I think of the point of reader mode being that the page is basically inert, it doesn't have distractions. Links in general might be okay, but links that appear and disappear as I scroll through the page (because my mouse sometimes crosses one) seem distracting.
[04:41:25] <Betawolf> But I dunno, I'm probably not the audience for this either.
[04:42:15] * gwern tries putting his mouse in the middle of the page and just tapping Down for a while. hm. it mostly doesn't pop up anything but when it does there's some odd layout shifting which seems to almost 'trap' you
[04:42:33] <saturn2> i really hate the layout shifting
[04:43:49] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I now think we should go with display:none because we might need to disable the hover swap entirely, and if/when we do that, then we will want display:none rather than whitespace. the shifting is bad for swapping regularly, but if the reader only does it like once, or never, then the shift is minor at best and the whitespace a permanent large cost
[04:44:36] <gwern> with the hover swap, I think I might just be too used to putting my mouse off to the side, and too frequent a user of annotations. it caters to my reading approach, but maybe not many other users
[04:46:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Alright. I'll do some more work making it smooth and we can re-evaluate when it's nearer to a workable version

[04:56:54] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: i have a really dumb statistics question ^^;;
[04:57:37] <RiversHaveWings> Like, I have a bunch of 512-dim vectors (the data matrix) and their outcome variables
[04:58:24] <RiversHaveWings> And I can do a linear regression that explains like half of the variance in the outcomes.
[04:59:00] <RiversHaveWings> Can I somehow decompose this single direction in the vector space into multiple ones that contribute to the outcomes?
[04:59:42] <RiversHaveWings> like i have a single factor, how do i get subfactors
[05:00:57] <gwern> so you have something like `Y ~ b*x1 + b*x2 .. + b*x512` which predicts R^2=50% and you want to rewrite this into something like `Y ~ b*z1 + b*z2 ; Z1 ~ x1 ... x256 ; Z2 ~ x256 ... x512`?
[05:01:00] <RiversHaveWings> principal component regression seems like not the right thing bc the components come from the data matrix without taking the outcomes into account
[05:02:04] <gwern> sounds like a SEM with latent factors to me
[05:03:15] <gwern> you can do an exploratory factor analysis of 'Y | x1..x512' to extract a sensible number of factors, then write a structural model relating them
[05:03:16] <RiversHaveWings> hmm
[05:03:35] <RiversHaveWings> (yeah, my R^2 is ~50%)
[05:05:33] <RiversHaveWings> ...do you just concat the outcomes to the data matrix or something ^^;
[05:06:17] <gwern> one problem here is you need some data on the sub-factors, otherwise they're just totally ambiguous and you can swap them arbitrarily so the model can't be fit
[05:06:26] <RiversHaveWings> ah.
[05:07:45] <RiversHaveWings> yeah the individual variables in the data matrix don't actually mean anything afaik
[05:07:58] <RiversHaveWings> they don't mean anything easily interpretable/sensible
[05:08:02] <RiversHaveWings> they are just embeddings
[05:08:21] <gwern> you know, say I have 'sexy bikini' pics and I want 2 factors for 'sexy' and 'bikini' and I have a big bunch of (sexy bikini quotient, x1..x512s), and I fit 'SBQ ~ SexyQuotient + BikiniQuotient; SexyQuotient =~ x1 + x2 + ...; BikiniQuotient =~ x1 + x2 ...'. well, how do I fit that? why is the first one *sexy* and the second one *bikini*? if I had them, it'd make just as much sense to swap them
[05:08:42] <RiversHaveWings> so they could be multiplied by any orthogonal matrix and it would be an equally sensible embedding space
[05:08:58] <RiversHaveWings> yeah
[05:10:19] <gwern> just because I wrote it as 'SexyQuotient' doesn't mean anything to the model. I would need some additional data. I would need to specify 'ok, we *do* know that x1 predicts sexiness, and we'll leave x1 in SexyQuotient and delete it from BikiniQuotient'. or we have more data like '(sexy bikini quotient, sexy quotient, x1..512)' and I can add a line like 'sexy quotient ~ x1..512'
[05:11:18] <RiversHaveWings> we *do* know that, hm
[05:11:23] <gwern> this is the standard psychometrics approach is to do exploratory, to extract a few possible factors which are measured by different tests, and then set up a precise SEM using those predefined factors with new data to test it
[05:11:25] <RiversHaveWings> So these are CLIP embeddings.
[05:11:48] <RiversHaveWings> So we can encode text into the embedding space too (my data matrix is image embeddings)
[05:11:56] <RiversHaveWings> But... how to determine what text
[05:12:43] <gwern> so ideally you would have something like '(sexy bikini quotient, bikini quotient, sexy quotient, x1..x512)'. then you can regress x1..x512 on all 3: first you predict the bikini and sexy quotients, then you predict the sexybikini qutoient based on the previous 2
[05:12:53] <RiversHaveWings> Ah
[05:13:06] <gwern> that's what makes it 'structural'. I have a little pyramid here
[05:13:19] <RiversHaveWings> I could just PCA the embeddings and run a linear regression on the principal components
[05:13:45] <gwern> 'bikini ~ x1..512; sexy ~ x1..512; sexybikini ~ bikini + sexy + x1..512'
[05:14:43] <gwern> yes, definitely. the downside there is that your PCAs may not be tailored to the application, as you said, and the components won't necessarily be cleanly interpretable as 'sexy' or 'bikini'. they might be fragmented over 5 or 10 PCs
[05:14:52] <gwern> and you may wind up using a lot of PCs
[05:15:14] <gwern> in the limit, enough PCs exactly reconstuct the data, so if you use a lot, unclear what you gain
[05:15:35] <RiversHaveWings> ..I hm, could make a little MLP
[05:16:05] <RiversHaveWings> But then it's not a convex objective anymore
[05:16:07] <gwern> presumably your goal here is to make use of having separate high-quality sexy and swimsuit variables, is it not? so you can, say, graph them on a 2D graph, or control them directly
[05:16:12] <RiversHaveWings> Yes
[05:16:42] <RiversHaveWings> I could make a little MLP, like 512->10->1
[05:16:52] <gwern> so the PCs wouldn't give you that unless you were very lucky and like, the top 2 PCs just happened to map very nicely onto 'sexy' and 'swimsuit' (instead of anything else they could map onto, like 'pool vs beach' or 'white vs foreign')
[05:17:00] <RiversHaveWings> And constrain the 512x10 to be orthogonal
[05:17:11] <RiversHaveWings> well, I don't know what the variables *are* that I want
[05:17:47] <gwern> for something like IQ tests which are carefully constructed, the top PC generally will in fact be, say, _g_. but for any kind of ML application with CLIP latents etc, I am very doubtful that the top PCs would just be what you want. they might be quite interesting things in their own right, but it would be a coincidence if you and the model agreed exactly
[05:17:59] <RiversHaveWings> Yep.
[05:18:58] <gwern> so that's one reason the SEM approach would be better. it'd give you actually 'sexy' and actually 'bikini' if you come up with data which is rated on either one of those and not simply the mashed-together sexy-bikini-quotient
[05:19:18] <RiversHaveWings> I can come up with some candidate things for an SEM
[05:19:40] <RiversHaveWings> By cosine similarity to various text embeddings or something.
[05:20:18] <RiversHaveWings> But then I could just have used those text embeddings directly as a loss when generating images.
[05:20:26] <RiversHaveWings> *in a loss
[05:21:50] <gwern> yes. I'm not sure going through a SEM buys you anything if you are just generating pseudodata that way. might as well just optimize directly
[05:22:52] <gwern> I was thinking you would ask humans for ratings directly on the 2 subfactors ("which of these 2 pictures is sexier") or you could try to like average out a 'sexy quotient' from a lot of sexy text prompts

[10:35:11] <feep[work]> like, this has to be a parody, right?
[10:35:27] <Ralith> or that the average person in the 1900s was less stressed

[10:44:20] <quanticle> I know
[10:44:26] <quanticle> That makes it more amusing
[10:44:26] <feep[work]> so this is just bad
[10:44:28] <feep[work]> nnn
[10:44:33] <feep[work]> no it has to actually be correct
[10:44:38] <feep[work]> otherwise it's just way underspecified
[10:44:51] <quanticle> Okay, you're right... it has to be code pages
[10:44:55] <quanticle> It's so close
[10:45:00] <feep[work]> yeah
[10:45:14] <feep[work]> it was called ANSI CODE PAGES
[10:45:48] <quanticle> Ugh, now I want to make a fixed version
[10:45:54] <quanticle> But it's late and I have no talent at this
[10:45:54] <feep[work]> which fits with the joke cause they were shit and rightly replaced
[10:45:59] <synthmeat> actually, you *can* backspace then strike another ascii over it. it's just that your preferred output device doesn't support it :P
[10:46:10] <feep[work]> well, no output device supports it
[10:46:16] <synthmeat> printers do
[10:46:18] <feep[work]> eh
[10:46:24] <feep[work]> I think a terminal would whiteout the previous char?
[10:46:25] <quanticle> ANSI code pages: "What do you mean, you want a document in *more than 1 language*??????"
[10:47:02] <synthmeat> that was how you typed up those weird APL chars initially
[10:47:20] <feep[work]> I guess it could work
[10:54:13] <quanticle> Huh, today I learned that, like with everything else, the Jews invented a word for being a 'Karen' first: https://www.gwern.net/docs/economics/2020-arbel.pdf

[10:54:18] <quanticle> Nudnik
[10:55:12] <PapuaHardyNet> That word is already famous in the linear/VR/adjacent twitter space - enough that someone put it in their twitter bio
[10:56:07] <quanticle> "Nudniks are those consumers who call to complain, complete satisfaction surveys, demand to speak with managers, post detailed online reviews, and file lawsuits. They usually have an innate sense of justice, atypical motivations, or an idiosyncratic utility function, which leads them to pursue action in situations where most consumers remain passive. In courtrooms and in the court of public
[10:56:09] <quanticle> opinion, nudniks are often derided as petty and vindictive. Yet through their actions, nudniks direct attention to seller underperformance, leading to a variety of legal and reputational sanctions in ways that complement, and sometimes substitute, direct legal intervention."

[10:56:20] <feep[work]> > agent suffix "nik"
[10:56:27] <feep[work]> Agent of Boredom sounds way too cool
[10:56:33] <PapuaHardyNet> I skimmed it the first time gwern linked it - it makes sense
[10:56:57] <quanticle> Anyway, this is my way of telling gwern that his site has made the front page of Hacker News
[10:56:59] <quanticle> Again
[10:57:02] <feep[work]> oh cool, the root comes from "need"
[10:57:12] <feep[work]> so the actual meaning is "Agent of Necessity"
[10:57:16] <feep[work]> this is not a coincidence because
[10:57:36] <feep[work]> ( https://www.etymonline.com/word/nudnik )
[10:57:37] <Robomot> nudnik | Etymology, origin and meaning of nudnik by etymonline (NUDNIK Meaning: "a bore, irritating person," 1947, from Yiddish, with agential suffix -nik + Polish nuda "boredom" or… See definitions of nudnik.)
[10:58:10] <feep[work]> also > Agent of Exhaustion
[10:58:22] <feep[work]> Agent, Exhaustion and Need are one root. This is because The Northern Caves is right about everything.
[10:58:26] <feep[work]> er, Boredom*
[10:58:48] <feep[work]> we may thus summarize nudnik as "Agent of Mundum."
[10:58:54] <quanticle> Oh no
[10:59:14] <quanticle> feep[work]: Please don't tell words to people that then causes those people to jump off buildings to their deaths
[10:59:19] <feep[work]> well I mean it makes sense, right!
[10:59:34] <feep[work]> associating misery, exhaustion and obligation is ... natural
[10:59:52] <feep[work]> if it wasn't obligatory, who would brave misery and exhaustion to do it?
[10:59:52] <synthmeat> huh. i'm a nudnik.
[11:00:32] <feep[work]> in other words, we can view misery and exhaustion as evidence of obligation at work.
[11:02:07] <feep[work]> > 
[11:02:08] <feep[work]> The more common Old English word for "need, necessity, want" was ðearf, but they were connected via a notion of "trouble, pain," and the two formed a compound, niedðearf "need, necessity, compulsion, thing needed." 
[11:03:02] <feep[work]> it's cool how old etymology presages all these ideas
[11:03:09] <feep[work]> sapir-whorf on the scale of centuries
[11:06:25] <PapuaHardyNet> "The strong version, or linguistic determinism, says that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories. This version is generally agreed to be false by modern linguists. The weak version says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions.[4] Research on weaker forms has produced positive empirical evidence for a relationship."

[11:24:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Combining diacritics totally existed
[11:24:54] <synthmeat> most my work is pretending to be rodin's statue :)
[11:25:10] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: in ascii..?
[11:25:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: They existed in text entry - which is where they belong, not in the encoding
[11:25:46] <feep[work]> words mean things
[11:25:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes they do
[11:26:04] <feep[work]> a combining diacritic is a glyph that combines with a previous glyph
[11:26:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: And indeed they still exist there: on the Mac, since time immemorial, you would press, e.g., Option-U to make an umlaut, and then a u, and it would make ü
[11:26:37] <feep[work]> show me a pre-unicode source calling this, specifically, a "combining diacritic" please.
[11:27:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean... that's tough, Unicode dates back to like 1987
[11:28:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do you mean "pre-adoption of Unicode"
[11:28:04] <feep[work]> yeah sure
[11:28:30] <feep[work]> I will count mentions in the context of an os that was not running unicode by default

[11:29:17] * Obormot\Arcturus googled "umlaut" and found https://www.umlaut.com/

[11:30:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I don't have my Mac Bible or Mac Secrets books handy atm, gonna look this up later maybe
[11:30:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> But does it matter though
[11:30:56] <feep[work]> yes
[11:30:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't agree
[11:31:16] <feep[work]> ok :D
[11:31:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not cede to Unicode the monopoly over this terminology
[11:31:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is surrender to imperialism
[11:31:29] <feep[work]> do you cede precedent
[11:31:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> I cede nothing! NOTHING!!
[11:31:40] <feep[work]> XD
[11:32:12] <feep[work]> well, the term makes sense though
[11:32:23] <feep[work]> the idea is that it's a *property* of the diacritic glyph that it's combining
[11:32:30] <feep[work]> I think that is novel in unicode
[11:32:49] <feep[work]> in other words, it's like a: where : implies a backspace
[11:33:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway
[11:33:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> As a practical matter
[11:33:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I maintain that this stuff belongs in text entry
[11:33:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not in the text encoding
[11:33:38] <feep[work]> I mean, it also belongs in text entry
[11:33:51] <synthmeat> https://jkorpela.fi/latin1/3.3.html
[11:33:52] <Robomot> Diacritics (accents etc.) and letters with them [The ISO Latin 1 character repertoire – a description with usage notes]
[11:33:57] <feep[work]> but having combining glyphs in the encoding gives some pleasant properties: for one, a combinatorial explosion of glyphs and vowels is avoided
[11:34:02] <synthmeat> "In ASCII, there are some characters which have both a primary use and a secondary meaning as a diacritic. The idea was that the secondary meaning applies when the character is preceded or followed by the ASCII backspace control code (BS, FE0, control-H, code 8). "
[11:34:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no reason for me to be able to generate a string that consists of "<COMBINING UMLAUT> <NUMERAL FIVE>", for example
[11:34:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> That string should be capable of existing
[11:34:34] <feep[work]> not*?
[11:34:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> er, yes
[11:34:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> should not
[11:34:41] <feep[work]> also um
[11:34:46] <feep[work]> tell that to the maths department :p
[11:34:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> FUCK THE MATH DEPARTMENT
[11:34:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> They have LaTeX.
[11:35:05] <feep[work]> (who have been gleefully combining every diacritic with every glyph they could get their hands on since time immemorial)
[11:35:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> If they insist on typesetting weird shit.
[11:35:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, and they shouldn't get to have that catered to with text encodings.
[11:35:33] <feep[work]> I once saw a letter with THREE DISTINCT MARKS, obormot!)
[11:35:35] <feep[work]> -)
[11:35:37] <feep[work]> Three marks!!
[11:35:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for combinatorial explosion, I agree that should be avoided, and the way to avoid that is
[11:35:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> to reform languages
[11:35:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> and remove the possibility of so many combinations.
[11:35:56] <feep[work]> okay like
[11:36:05] <feep[work]> obormot I love you but you are very russian.
[11:36:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Look
[11:36:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> How many diacritics does English need? Zero.
[11:36:19] <PapuaHardyNet> lol so University of Bonn's masters app asks me for the exact time I was born
[11:36:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Russian? Zero.
[11:36:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Therefore no languages need diacritics.
[11:36:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Q.E.D.
[11:36:35] <synthmeat> you need it for specifying accents
[11:36:36] <feep[work]> ^^
[11:36:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> The ONLY diacritic that is necessary
[11:36:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is the umlaut
[11:36:46] <saturn2> but without combining diacritics how could you make spooky text in reddit comments?
[11:36:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exclusively for heavy metal band names
[11:37:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> All other ones are superfluous and should be removed.
[11:37:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: SPOOKY TEXT SHOULD ALSO BE ABOLISHED
[11:37:31] <feep[work]> unicode removes combining diacritics
[11:37:37] <feep[work]> in exchange, unicode adds zalgo font block

[11:51:00] <feep[work]> and uh

[11:58:04] <feep[work]> if you want to have an explicit state for "there, but no data", {} is two characters shorter than null!
[11:58:56] <synthmeat> the one querying getting `undefined` will know that he fucked up the access this way
[11:59:08] <feep[work]> undefined is not defined in the json spec
[11:59:08] <synthmeat> (which is pretty often in js)
[11:59:11] <feep[work]> this sounds like an api problem
[11:59:13] <capisce> https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22972989/journey-10-year-anniversary-multiplayer-jenova-chen-austin-wintory
[11:59:13] <Robomot> 10 years later, there’s still nothing like Journey’s multiplayer - The Verge (Journey is celebrating its 10th anniversary, and its multiplayer remains an incredibly memorable experience. Developer Jenova Chen talked with The Verge about creating the game.)
[11:59:41] <feep[work]> the interchange format spec should not concern itself with the needs of your query system.
[11:59:48] <feep[work]> js can have its null
[12:00:24] <feep[work]> it was a mistake to propagate it into the "ostensibly independent of js" exchange format.
[12:03:14] <kuudes> also jsonp for references
[12:04:22] <kuudes> const a = {}; const b = {c:a}; a.d = b;
[12:05:09] <feep[work]> .. what's your point?
[12:05:24] <feep[work]> I don't get what that code sample expresses, except "down with mutable by default"
[12:05:33] <kuudes> serialize that
[12:05:40] <feep[work]> ...?
[12:06:28] <feep[work]> to be clear, I don't even agree that you should write *code* like that
[12:06:35] <feep[work]> let alone do anything like it on the serialization layer
[12:07:05] <feep[work]> inasmuch as json cannot express this, I frankly consider it a huge upside.
[12:07:21] <kuudes> .wp jsonp
[12:07:23] <feepbot> kuudes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP JSONP, or JSON-P (JSON with Padding), is a historical JavaScript technique for requesting data by loading a <code class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><script></code> element, which is an element intended to load ordinary JavaScript.
[12:07:24] <Robomot> JSONP - Wikipedia (JSONP, or JSON-P (JSON with Padding), is a historical JavaScript technique for requesting data by loading a <script> element,[1] which is an element intended to load ordinary JavaScript. It was proposed by Bob Ippolito in 2005.[2] JSONP enables sharing of data bypassing same-origin policy, which disallows running JavaScript code to read media DOM elements or XMLHttpRequest data fetched from …)
[12:07:36] <kuudes> no, not that
[12:07:41] <kuudes> hmm, what was it
[12:10:45] <kuudes> oh well
[12:12:35] <feep[work]> kuudes: are you thinking of JSON Pointer?
[12:13:36] * feep[work] is very skeptical
[12:14:30] <feep[work]> that said, it does json credit that these people can basically be reinventing xsd and xslt at once and it's still only barely horrifying
[12:32:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: fyi the Armstrong & Sandberg 2013 link does not pop up because x-frame-options etc.
[12:34:34] <saturn2> of course, lisp can easily serialize circular references http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_dhp.htm
[12:34:34] <Robomot> CLHS: Section 2.4.8.16
[12:35:13] <feep[work]> I mean, it's not hard to make up a way to do it in json
[12:35:23] <feep[work]> along the same line
[12:35:41] <feep[work]> but like: "our serialization format can encode a circular reference" is not necessarily something to be proud of, lisp...
[12:35:45] <feep[work]> (and yet: so emblematic!)
[12:36:34] <saturn2> it's not hard, and yet, they still failed
[12:36:49] <feep[work]> I would argue they succeeded at avoiding the temptation.
[12:36:59] <saturn2> you'd also be wrong
[12:37:01] <feep[work]> shrug
[12:37:32] <saturn2> you should either be allowed to make circular references, or not
[12:37:43] <feep[work]> hang on, that makes no sense
[12:37:56] <saturn2> if you're allowed to make them then serializing them shouldn't go into an infinite loop
[12:38:05] <feep[work]> there is no way to prevent circular references *semantically*, I'm p sure that literally violates whatshisface
[12:38:19] <feep[work]> oh, in the data format. yes, I agree.
[12:38:26] <feep[work]> that's not a json problem tho
[12:38:45] <feep[work]> json is a serializer for many languages. the languages are obligated to avoid this, or else agree on a way to encode it.
[12:38:48] *** Quits: [_] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:38:59] <saturn2> you can prevent circular references if all your data is immutable
[12:39:06] <feep[work]> yep
[12:39:38] <feep[work]> (this is another good argument for why all data structures should be immutable by default, and all domain data should be immutable period.)
[12:40:09] <synthmeat> radicals
[12:43:52] <feep[work]> mutable state is a powerful but dangerous optimization technique
[12:44:03] <feep[work]> it is ludicrous how many languages enable it by default for every field.
[12:44:39] <feep[work]> look at your data structures filled entirely with get accessors! you know the truth, but you refuse to speak it
[12:45:20] <PapuaHardyNet> you want languages to have immutable data structures by default?
[12:45:25] <feep[work]> of course
[12:45:58] <feep[work]> (neat doesn't have this, but that's a big *yet* - I've simply not gotten around to wiring it in. the compiler is already immutable almost everywhere.)
[12:46:14] <synthmeat> immutable primitives (and lang-level data structs) is fine by me. leave me alone beyond that.
[12:46:45] <feep[work]> this saves so much grief because it forces you to think about data structures in terms of input-output transformation, rather than jamming the output somewhere in the middle. it also makes multithreading enormously easier
[12:47:00] <feep[work]> about algorithms*
[12:47:47] <PapuaHardyNet> thanks for the reasoning, it makes sense now
[12:48:02] <quanticle> The only even remotely popular language that is immutable by default is Erlang.
[12:48:12] <PapuaHardyNet> rust?
[12:48:20] <feep[work]> haskell?
[12:48:34] <quanticle> feep[work]: I said *remotely popular*
[12:48:40] <feep[work]> :p I set that up, fair nuf
[12:48:44] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Rust allows mutability
[12:48:59] <quanticle> As long as the borrow checker is okay with it, you can mutate away
[12:49:05] <synthmeat> and guess what, erlang is slow af
[12:49:11] <quanticle> Is it?
[12:49:24] <quanticle> Erlang is pretty fast at a lot of network-based message passing things
[12:49:33] <quanticle> Faster than Python or Clojure, at any rate.
[12:50:04] <synthmeat> it's superslow at anything compute intensive, which i assumed is the slow/fast dimension
[12:50:32] <quanticle> Oh yeah, immutable anything is really hard to make work in a compute-intensive setting. I'll grant that.
[12:50:47] <quanticle> Erlang gets a special pass, because all anyone uses it for is message passing, lol
[12:51:03] <quanticle> And immutability helps a lot with that, because it unlocks a whole slew of zero-copy optimizations
[12:51:36] <synthmeat> yeah, it looks great for what it's built for and what it is
[12:52:11] <feep[work]> I'm not convinced it's *necessarily* slow
[12:52:18] <saturn2> it's not
[12:52:20] <feep[work]> I grant that you need a lot more thought about your data structures.
[12:52:26] <quanticle> Clojure is *almost* immutable by default, but it has special constructs that allow you to mutate in a controlled setting.
[12:52:52] <quanticle> Also, the nice thing about immutability is that it makes parallelizing code a lot easier.
[12:53:04] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[12:53:19] <quanticle> You can just run n copies of a function, in parallel, knowing that they won't step on each others' toes.
[12:53:54] <quanticle> Because they work on immutable data, so they'll be making their own private copies as necessary.
[12:54:21] <feep[work]> yep
[12:55:15] <synthmeat> by "not neccessarily slow" do you mean "if you bust out some C"? i don't think that's fair
[12:55:31] <quanticle> No, he means that if you set up your data structures correctly
[12:55:50] <quanticle> There are ways to make fast immutable data structures that don't copy the whole thing every time they need to make a change.
[12:56:09] <feep[work]> yeah
[12:56:28] <feep[work]> and factoring out your frequently mutated regions will make your code faster anyways.
[12:57:44] <feep[work]> tbf, processors could do a lot more with active caching optimizations for immutable vs mutable data, so rn it's not as good as it could be
[12:58:02] <quanticle> Honestly, I just wish Intel had made hardware transactional memory work
[12:58:09] <feep[work]> would be cool
[12:58:17] <quanticle> They had a prototype implementation of it in their... Haswell, I think, processors
[12:58:24] <quanticle> And then they immediately had to disable it
[12:58:29] <quanticle> Because it was buggy as hell
[12:58:35] <quanticle> And then they never revisited it
[12:59:41] <quanticle> Clojure has software transactional memory, but without hardware support it's never going to be any faster than writing mutexes and semaphores.
[13:04:45] <quanticle> "TSX/TSX-NI was documented by Intel in February 2012, and debuted in June 2013 on selected Intel microprocessors based on the Haswell microarchitecture. Haswell processors below 45xx as well as R-series and K-series (with unlocked multiplier) SKUs do not support TSX/TSX-NI. In August 2014, Intel announced a bug in the TSX/TSX-NI implementation on current steppings of Haswell, Haswell-E,
[13:04:47] <quanticle> Haswell-EP and early Broadwell CPUs, which resulted in disabling the TSX/TSX-NI feature on affected CPUs via a microcode update. In 2016, a side-channel timing attack was found by abusing the way TSX/TSX-NI handles transactional faults (i.e. page faults) in order to break kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) on all major operating systems. In 2021, Intel released a microcode update
[13:04:49] <quanticle> that disabled the TSX/TSX-NI feature on CPU generations from Skylake to Coffee Lake, as a mitigation for discovered security issues."

[13:15:44] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : 'John Hopfield (1982) invented the Hopfield network. The basic objective to create such a network is the regeneration of the data fed to the system after proper noise correction. It is a network of neurons connected with other neurons with symmetrical links with positive or negative weights. The neurons are also referred to as nodes.'
[13:17:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, the basic functionality is there (auto-unmasking on scroll down included). Pull, see reader-mode.js (not added to any templates or anything, of course, just the file itself, so testing as before, paste into console). The devil, as usual, is now in the details - timings, minutiae of interactions, UI polish, playing well with popups, bug hunting, etc., etc.
[13:20:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: One implementation decision to be made: you will see a config variable ` unmaskLinksTriggerElementSelector` (i.e., unmask when *what* element is scrolled into view?), currently set to `#see-also` - but of course that doesn't generalize to all pages... how should this be handled? Some universally present element (perhaps the page nav arrows? but I don't think that's good)? Some per-page config (inlined on build, read by
[13:20:42] <Obormot\Arcturus>  the JS), perhaps...? Well, it's a thing to think about, anyway, but not a block to development of the feature otherwise
[13:22:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Oh, and of course no work whatever has been done on the mobile version of the feature (I didn't want to even bother starting that until we had a working prototype for desktop).

[13:32:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the comments of the Facebook post, Yudkowsky seemingly denies that pronouns convey sex category information to English speakers, claiming, “I do not know what it feels like from the inside to feel like a pronoun is attached to something in your head much more firmly than ‘doesn’t look like an Oliver’ is attached to something in your head.” This self-report is not plausible, as evidenced by previous writings by
[13:32:08] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Yudkowsky that treat sex and pronouns as synonymous." ... hahaha *what*
[13:32:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> He can't just be *lying*, right?? He went on a whole crusade against lying
[13:32:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> But how is it even possible to have brainwashed oneself so thoroughly
[13:33:02] <feep[work]> I think this is just spectacular levels of typical-minding.
[13:33:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> No def. not
[13:33:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I agree with Zack, I don't believe Eliezer
[13:33:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, at all. Not even a little.
[13:34:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> He's not typical-minding; his mind is in fact perfectly ordinary in this regard, he's just... well, again, I don't think lying exactly, but doublethinking REALLY HARD
[13:34:17] <feep[work]> eh, I actually believe him
[13:34:25] <capisce> in Chinese the pronouns for he and she are the same in spoken language, but different in writing
[13:34:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes well Eliezer is not Chinese :p
[13:35:05] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: specifically, because I'm p sure that ... like, eliezer has *experienced* the gender binary *as something beyond appearance*, but I'm not sure he experiences it when it isn't fed to him
[13:35:07] <capisce> interestingly the prounoun for he and she are the same in Chinese and Estonian: "ta"
[13:35:13] <feep[work]> I think to him it's a kind of mental dark matter

[13:37:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I vaguely remember this post and will reread it momentarily
[13:37:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile:
[13:37:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I’m not claiming that Yudkowsky should have a different pronoun usage policy. I agree that misgendering all trans people “on principle” seems very wrong and unappealing." ... well, *I* am claiming that he should have a different pronoun usage, and I deny that this would constitute "misgendering all trans people" ("on principle" or otherwise)
[13:37:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean look at what Eliezer actually, apparently, said:
[13:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Yudkowsky then goes on to proclaim, in connection with pronouns for transgender people, that “the simplest and best protocol is, ‘”He” refers to the set of people who have asked us to use “he”, with a default for those-who-haven’t-asked that goes by gamete size’ and to say that this just is the normative definition. Because it is logically rude, not just socially rude, to try to bake any other more complicated
[13:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  and controversial definition into the very language protocol we are using to communicate.”"
[13:38:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gamete size.
[13:38:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gamete. Size.
[13:38:35] <feep[work]> well that part makes sense
[13:38:38] <feep[work]> it's very eliezer too
[13:38:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> NO IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE
[13:38:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody thinks like this!
[13:38:47] <feep[work]> it kinda does, because that's upstream of all the gender stuff
[13:38:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gamete size???
[13:39:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Irrelevant! Nobody know wtf a "gamete size" is! People before <whatever year> didn't even know about gametes or their sizes and yet SOMEHOW STILL MANAGED TO USE PRONOUNS
[13:39:25] <saturn2> do you wear your gametes on your sleeve or something? gross
[13:39:31] <feep[work]> :layman warning: gamete size is the biological basis of the whole key-vs-lock thing, and evolutionarily associated with pregnancy being high-investment
[13:39:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Absolutely irrelevant
[13:39:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of that can possibly be what gendered pronouns *mean*
[13:40:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> It just can't
[13:40:09] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I think you're partially missing context here
[13:40:18] <rsaarelm> "The gender that applies many biological resources to reproduction as a parent vs the gender that applies few biological resources to reproduction as a parent" is presumably the thing feep is referring about as being upstream of the gender stuff?
[13:40:21] <feep[work]> which is that zack is aggressively against "the categories were made for man".
[13:40:31] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: yes
[13:40:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I have extensively discussed this fact with Zack, in person, so no, I assure you, I am extremely far from missing this context :p
[13:40:59] <feep[work]> fair fair
[13:41:13] <feep[work]> anyway, I'm saying there's superweapons dynamics in play here
[13:41:19] <rsaarelm> Like, obviously people don't have the biological terminology for this, but dismissing it via that is like that old sociobiology study group rebuttal that hunter-gatherers don't know fractional math so they can't change how they treat people based on how related the people are to them.
[13:41:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I know about all that
[13:41:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amd regardless of anything
[13:41:26] <feep[work]> not as a logical argument but as an argument why somebody might be retreating to a logical/upstream definition
[13:41:59] <feep[work]> because what zach is fighting for, kinda, is the right to notice upstream factors.
[13:42:12] <rsaarelm> "Gamete size" is a bit wonky shorthand for "pregnancy takes a lot of biological resources" tho.
[13:42:14] <saturn2> all we need is a third set of pronouns that applies to cat ladies, comic book guys, catholic priests, young children, etc
[13:42:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gendered pronouns, as a basic matter of linguistics and semantics, cannot MEAN anything about gametes or their size or any biological implementation details that the overwhelming majority of people don't know about and that NOBODY knew about before not too long ago
[13:42:31] <feep[work]> sure they can.
[13:42:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> No. They can't.
[13:42:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is not how language works.
[13:42:41] <feep[work]> words are empirical, not rational.
[13:42:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, words are neither of those things.
[13:42:56] <feep[work]> but because they are empirical, they can refer to upstream factors before those are known.
[13:43:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope.
[13:43:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> They absolutely cannot.
[13:43:11] <rsaarelm> Obormot\Arcturus: They mean things about the thing everyone notices and that's caused by the different biological reproduction strategies.
[13:43:12] <feep[work]> or rather, they can act as classifiers equivalent to upstream factors.
[13:43:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Which is totally different and totally irrelevant
[13:43:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> rsaarelm: Also irrelevant.
[13:43:34] <rsaarelm> Are we arguing about "gamete size" not being a valid shorthand for biological reproduction strategy disparity?
[13:43:36] <feep[work]> no, that's what does words! the upstream factor causes the phenomenon causes the word
[13:43:37] <rsaarelm> Okay, we're not.
[13:44:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: That is immaterial to the question of "what does this word mean".
[13:44:25] <feep[work]> I disagree.
[13:44:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ugh it's like you guys have never even read piles of 20th century analytic philosophy
[13:44:55] <feep[work]> XD
[13:45:05] <saturn2> it doesn't even make sense, since people without gametes still get a pronoun
[13:45:31] <feep[work]> the point is, if the classifier in your head is just "measure the phenomena of the upstream factor" then the word means the upstream factor *as a matter of correlation between semantics and observation*.
[13:45:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> no.
[13:45:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is not how meaning works.
[13:46:12] <feep[work]> there is a symmetry between the generator and the classifier.
[13:46:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Irrelevant.
[13:46:20] <feep[work]> that is literally meaning.
[13:46:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> No.
[13:46:39] * feep[work] shrugs
[13:46:42] <feep[work]> it's ... meaning ... to me?
[13:46:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> No!
[13:46:53] <feep[work]> I don't know what to tell you
[13:46:56] <feep[work]> this is genuinely how I model language
[13:46:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Obvious counterargument: what did gendered pronouns mean before we discovered gametes?
[13:47:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing/
[13:47:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> ?
[13:47:05] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: they already meant gametes.
[13:47:12] <feep[work]> because the structure was already there.
[13:47:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Words can't mean things that the user of the words has absolutely no knowledge or concept of
[13:47:27] <feep[work]> yes they can.
[13:47:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't be ridiculous
[13:47:34] <feep[work]> I mean it.
[13:47:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> That account of meaning is wildly absurd
[13:47:42] <saturn2> does it follow that no one knows what anything means until the end of time?
[13:47:51] <feep[work]> rain meant precipitation before we knew how clouds worked.
[13:47:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good lord
[13:48:12] <feep[work]> saturn2: no, because knowledge is incremental
[13:48:48] <saturn2> i don't know what knowledge is going to increment or how
[13:48:56] <feep[work]> the ... body of human understanding? science?
[13:49:06] <feep[work]> we did learn about gametes.
[13:49:14] <saturn2> right, that can change at any moment and i can't predict how it will change
[13:49:24] <feep[work]> right, which is why you have to go with your best present guess
[13:50:04] <saturn2> but every time it changes, the things i said no longer mean what the person hearing them thought they meant when they heard them
[13:50:18] <feep[work]> no they still mean the same thing, they just don't have the same backing labels.
[13:50:32] <feep[work]> the model structure changes but the selected set stays largely the same
[13:50:47] <feep[work]> plus or minus framing effects
[13:51:14] <feep[work]> (which is where the politics happens)
[13:52:06] <feep[work]> that said, yes of course when listening to someone you have to model their mental generators
[13:52:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Here's a scenario for you. You wake up one day in a strange place. Omega shows up and tells you that you have been transported into one of many possible alternate realities. They all look more or less the same, but their underlying substrates and hidden laws are all radically different. Suddenly (apparent) water starts to fall from the (apparent) sky, and you say "Omega, since you're so powerful, can you conjure me
[13:52:07] <Obormot\Arcturus>  an umbrella for this rain?" Now: what does the word "rain" mean in that sentence of yours? Does it mean: "H20 precipitating due to gravity"? Does it mean: some guy sprinkling you from a hidden sprinkler mounted in the sky-painted ceiling, a a la _The Truman Show_? Does it mean: simulated raindrops generated by the simulation program? Something else? Nothing?
[13:52:28] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: it depends on the nature of this reality which structure my words select.
[13:52:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> But you don't know what that nature is
[13:52:43] <feep[work]> a word describing something true cannot mean something false.
[13:52:45] <feep[work]> yes.
[13:52:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact, you're not ever gonna find out
[13:52:55] <feep[work]> yes! that's my entire point! you're making my point
[13:53:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what does your word you used mean?
[13:53:06] <feep[work]> we don't *need* to know what structure words select to use them
[13:53:09] <feep[work]> but they still select a structure
[13:53:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> You don't know the meaning of the word?
[13:53:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> That you used?
[13:53:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> You used it but you have no idea what it means?
[13:53:22] <feep[work]> Correct. I know the output of the generator, but not the structure.
[13:53:32] <saturn2> i thought this was what i asked and you said no
[13:53:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you used the word "rain" but if Omega asks you "what does tha
[13:53:37] <feep[work]> if I observe the rain more, I will gain more insight
[13:53:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> t word mean"
[13:53:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then you can't answer?
[13:53:45] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: it means "the thing that makes water fall on me."
[13:53:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aha
[13:53:58] <feep[work]> it's indexical, propagating backwards from the observed phenomenon.
[13:54:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, it means "the water falling on me" and/or "the thing that makes water fall on me"
[13:54:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> *That is the meaning*
[13:54:22] <feep[work]> yes, that's my point
[13:54:30] <feep[work]> we have no idea what the thing is, but the word selects it anyway.
[13:54:46] <feep[work]> then later maybe we find out *what the thing we referred to from the start was*.
[13:54:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the MEANING of the word is just that description
[13:54:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that meaning does not change
[13:55:09] <feep[work]> yes but the referent becomes observed!
[13:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Irrelevant
[13:55:14] <feep[work]> core!
[13:55:23] <feep[work]> the referent is *the topic of the word*.
[13:55:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[13:55:42] <feep[work]> anyway, I'mma grab food.
[13:55:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway feep this is very boring because this is actually something that philosophers discussed at length and settled
[13:56:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, they didn't settle it exactly, but they sure ruled out views like yours
[13:56:19] <feep[work]> well I'm glad to report that I am not a party to the Treaty of Philosophers to Not Relitigate Settled Matters
[13:56:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Too bad because they are VERY settled
[13:56:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> You should read them
[13:56:39] <feep[work]> look
[13:56:41] <feep[work]> this field is shit
[13:56:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah
[13:56:48] <feep[work]> saying that philosophy settled this
[13:56:57] <feep[work]> when philosophy had also p much settled that you should two box
[13:57:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also nah
[13:57:03] <feep[work]> and that philosophical free will was a valid topic
[13:57:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is though
[13:57:09] <feep[work]> does not compel me. :P
[13:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean you've been wrong about everything you just said...
[13:57:29] <feep[work]> I wish.
[13:57:56] <feep[work]> anyway! afk
[13:58:40] <saturn2> is there a fancy name for feep's opinion?
[13:58:50] <synthmeat> (we're getting more and more "bb lunch" thingies recently at peaks of disagreements)
[13:58:59] <feep[work]> synthmeat: I always have lunch at 11:30.
[13:59:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: yyyes but I forget atm what it is, one sec let me see if I can find it quick
[13:59:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Semantic externalism
[14:00:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess in feep's case it would be like "X-Treem Super Semantic Externalism"
[14:00:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_externalism
[14:00:27] <Robomot> Semantic externalism - Wikipedia (In the philosophy of language, semantic externalism (the opposite of semantic internalism) is the view that the meaning of a term is determined, in whole or in part, by factors external to the speaker. According to an externalist position, one can claim without contradiction that two speakers could be in exactly the same brain state at the time of an utterance, and yet mean …)
[14:01:31] <saturn2> i see
[14:03:07] <saturn2> oh this has something to do with the H2O or XYZ thing
[14:03:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> "the view that the meaning of a term is determined, in whole or in part, by factors external to the speaker" - but I don't think most philosophers go for the "in whole" version
[14:03:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes exactly
[14:03:25] <saturn2> i never really understood the point of that until now
[14:04:16] <saturn2> yeah i'm siding with the philosophers on this one, sorry feep
[14:06:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference is also relevant
[14:06:14] <Robomot> Sense and reference - Wikipedia (In the philosophy of language, the distinction between sense and reference was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege in 1892 (in his paper "On Sense and Reference"; German: "Über Sinn und Bedeutung"),[1] reflecting the two ways he believed a singular term may have meaning.)
[14:06:18] <saturn2> so now that we've straightened that out, do we know which pronouns to use?
[14:07:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe not, but at least we can say that we need not inspect people's gametes before deciding
[14:07:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Gamete size, really. I'm still amazed that Eliezer actually wrote this with a straight face)
[14:08:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Hasn't he ever read the goddamn Sequences)
[14:20:03] *** Quits: nullcone (uid11626@id-11626.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[14:29:05] <feep[work]> back from food
[14:29:17] <feep[work]> I realized that I expressed myself a bit badly
[14:30:26] <feep[work]> I think inasmuch as the hidden sky sprinkler *acts like rain*, it is *structurally equivalent to rain*. ie. I don't think that the word rain can select either of two *different things* depending on indexical location, rather I think that the sprinkler and the cloud *are structurally equivalent* in that they both have the rain-nature. which is still a thing that can be unmodelled at the time the word 
[14:30:32] <feep[work]> is coined.
[14:31:46] <feep[work]> ie. it's not that I either mean the sky sprinker or the precipitation depending on where I am, it's that I think the sky sprinkler is of a kind with the raincloud - or else the word is a bad word.
[14:32:50] <feep[work]> for instance, a shower is not rain, but this is because it acts differently. if I could turn rain on and off by turning a handle, then not only would this mean that this was actually a shower (a rainshower, lol), but it would mean that the clouds would have to have "shower-structure"
[14:33:31] <feep[work]> there would need to be a causal pattern linking the handle and the water, and even if I did not understand this causal pattern the word would still select it, and it would be *consistent between manifestations.*
[14:34:02] <feep[work]> in other words, this is just patternism applied to other words than "I".
[14:36:33] <feep[work]> ie. if I saw the piping diagram for a shower and a handle valve for the first time, I would *understand that this is the thing I had always meant.* I would recognize the causal model for "shower" in my head matching to the causal model parsed from the diagram.
[14:36:49] <synthmeat> (i don't find this to be settled philosophical question *at all*)
[14:37:51] <feep[work]> and this fact would be true *even if I had no conscious insight* into the causal structure generating my shower-anticipations.
[14:38:09] <feep[work]> iow this is just eliezer's "morality is objectively real because brains are."
[14:41:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: You're just agreeing with me now
[14:41:57] <feep[work]> if somebody turned on the sky-sprinkler whenever the skybox showed clear sky, and turned it off whenever the skybox showed rainclouds, would it be rain?
[14:42:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: (But this causes you to be disagreeing with Eliezer)
[14:42:29] <feep[work]> mh, I don't think so.
[14:42:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway the point that cuts through all of this is:
[14:42:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Words are for communication
[14:42:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Talking about what they "mean" outside the context of any communicative acts between persons, is absurd
[14:43:01] <feep[work]> words are for instantiating concepts in other people's heads.
[14:43:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's ... *one* thing they are for
[14:43:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a subset of "communication"
[14:43:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Regardless
[14:43:39] <feep[work]> I mean sure, there's many channels
[14:44:01] <feep[work]> "it's gonna rain" "no, I don't see any clouds"
[14:44:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> This means that if some information is not possessed by the sender, nor received by the receiver, nor even intended by the sender to be received by the receiver, nor is in the possession of sender or receiver at any point in the process - in other words, if some information does not participate in the act of communication in any way -
[14:44:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> - then it cannot play a part in a discussion of what the words involved "mean"
[14:45:03] <feep[work]> granted.
[14:45:18] <feep[work]> however, I disagree that the information is not in the possession of the sender/receiver just because it is not consciously modeled.
[14:45:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, and that rules out "gendered pronouns mean gamete size".
[14:45:27] <feep[work]> nope
[14:45:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Ok see that last part is wrong
[14:46:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But also irrelevant, unless by "not consciously" you mean something weird)
[14:46:17] <feep[work]> the gamete size argument is that when you see the causal structure of how reproductive strategy (plus ...) creates downstream gender effect, you should recognize it matching to the models in your head built from observation of gender stereotypes.
[14:46:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Irrelevant
[14:46:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most people don't see any such thing, and yet use gendered pronouns anyway, and quite successfully
[14:46:39] <feep[work]> that's aboutness to me.
[14:46:56] <feep[work]> yes, I'm not saying that is the thing, I'm saying that the gender-structure was always identical with the gamete-structure.
[14:47:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Irrelevant!
[14:47:06] <feep[work]> core!
[14:47:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But also false)
[14:47:19] <feep[work]> well, assuming the premises, which I'm not certain about
[14:47:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Gamete structure is of course *not* identical with gender-structure, come on)
[14:47:57] <feep[work]> I shall act as if I believe it to be identical for the purpose of sticking close to the mindstate of zach/eliezer
[14:48:05] <feep[work]> (my model of the)
[14:50:52] <feep[work]> if we take the feeling of a concept collapsing lots of observations (insight porning), and if we *assume* (and I am eliding all of politics here, specifically about transgender, please bear with me) that the compression is lossless, then that means that the cluster of observations and the concept *are and were always the same thing.*
[14:51:12] <feep[work]> that is how a word can select something you don't know.
[14:51:32] <feep[work]> compressions of observation sets are objective facts.
[14:51:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> What? No
[14:51:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of that is true
[14:52:33] <feep[work]> a function is exhaustively defined by a mapping of inputs to outputs.
[14:52:55] <feep[work]> whether we write this down as a set of tuples or an algorithm is bookkeeping.
[14:53:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course, but where is this exhaustive definition? I see no such thing
[14:53:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> If it ignores connotations, for instance, it ain't exhaustive!
[14:53:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's just one objection - one of the more obvious ones
[14:53:47] <feep[work]> hang on, I'm just talking about the concept-selecting channel of language.
[14:53:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, me too
[14:54:05] <feep[work]> obv there's a lot of other content, but I don't think that either participant was interested in them
[14:54:22] <feep[work]> the concept-selecting channel does not carry connotations
[14:55:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disagree
[14:55:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> On both counts
[14:55:55] <feep[work]> fair enough on the first count at least, the second one might be a breakdown of the channel analogy
[14:56:15] <feep[work]> words do select concepts, let's disregard the connotative content for the purpose of discussion, since we're not disagreeing about it probably
[14:56:58] <feep[work]> then language is approximate, we're *assuming* that both brains have seen the same sense data or at least have seen sense data that is compressed by the same concepts
[14:56:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I decline to disregard it; once we start disregarding things, we can of course make any kind of false thing seem true
[14:57:05] <feep[work]> if this was not the case, we would have a misunderstanding.
[14:57:48] <feep[work]> -- interesting point of leverage
[14:58:02] <feep[work]> let's split the set of things that are red in two disjoint halves
[14:58:14] <feep[work]> let's say person A has only seen things from the first set, person B only from the second set
[14:58:23] <feep[work]> if person A tells person B about a red thing, are they communicating?
[14:59:20] <feep[work]> I would argue yes; it seems to me that your view should commit you to arguing no
[14:59:56] <feep[work]> there is an underlying structure of redness related to reflected colors and sense cells in the eye; even if neither A nor B know this structure they can select it.
[15:00:25] <feep[work]> (there are of course many such structures.)
[15:00:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not see why my view should commit me to arguing no
[15:01:11] <feep[work]> because the pure set of things selected by "red thing" is nonoverlapping between A and B
[15:02:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what? Your logic only works if people are incapable of abstraction, or visual imagination, or any number of other things besides "thinking of specific physical objects and sets thereof"
[15:02:24] <feep[work]> and assuming neither B nor A know about how the eye works and about frequencies, they cannot be talking about an explicit concept or a shared knowledge
[15:02:43] <feep[work]> I'm arguing that they are communicating even if they are incapable of abstraction or visual imagination or any number of other things.
[15:02:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't make sense of that claim
[15:03:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> If they're incapable of abstraction or visual imagination or etc., then they have no concept of "red", no word for "red", and they're not even human so do they have language? Or language at all like anything we recognize as such?? Probably not
[15:03:34] <feep[work]> admittedly I may have claimed the "incapable of abstraction" part hastily
[15:03:52] <feep[work]> well, hang on, if you're incapable of abstraction or visual imagination you can still classify your visual input
[15:04:05] <feep[work]> for instance, both of them may have red things in front of them at that moment
[15:04:13] <synthmeat> is meaning of a word devalued if it means many different things to many different people? is it less meaningful?
[15:04:20] <feep[work]> yes?
[15:04:37] <feep[work]> but that seems unrelated
[15:05:43] <feep[work]> beh, gonna bow out here
[15:05:56] <feep[work]> this is not a good use of time, let alone worktime, and lunch is over
[15:06:07] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: thank you for the debate though!
[15:06:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Likewise :)
[15:06:23] <feep[work]> :)
[15:07:50] <Obormot\Gaia> But! As a postscript I will add that the argument you said I should be forced to commit to - that the people in your scenario aren't communicating - is, actually, not obviously false, and in fact has considerable real-world precedent
[15:08:44] <feep[work]> I on my part would add that the most interesting part of my view is the divergence from its ideal, and that's where all the fighting happens.
[15:09:04] <Obormot\Gaia> To see this, consider (as mentioned in e.g. Roger Shepard's paper on color vision in _The Adapted Mind_) the fact that the *number of basic color terms* (and associated concepts) differs across human cultural groups
[15:09:15] <feep[work]> ie. concepts don't compress cleanly, which is why we have fights over what concepts people should be forced to use, because this does influence their behavior and expectations
[15:09:34] <Obormot\Gaia> (And, interestingly, the linguistic development of additional color terms/concepts always comes in a certain order!)
[15:09:37] <feep[work]> and irl people fail to communicate allll the time
[15:09:53] <Obormot\Gaia> So, e.g., there are some cultures that use the same word for what we call "green" and what we call "blue"
[15:10:00] * feep[work] is aware
[15:10:32] <feep[work]> I don't actually think colors select a generic pattern
[15:10:50] <feep[work]> I think that one is much closer to "shared experience of <giant bag of samples>"
[15:11:13] <Obormot\Gaia> Now suppose that we take two groups of people from such a culture, and we ensure somehow (or discover) that group A has seen only things we would call green, and group B, only things we would call blue. Now someone from A says to someone from B, "I saw a cerulean rock today" - have they communicated?
[15:11:18] <feep[work]> aaa shtop
[15:11:37] <Obormot\Gaia> And now consider the following variant:
[15:11:40] <feep[work]> shtooop
[15:12:30] <Obormot\Gaia> Suppose we take two groups of people from *our* culture (with our distinction between green and blue), and we force them to communicate in the language of the previously mentioned culture - and now someone from group C says to someone from group D (in the language of the A/B people), "I saw a cerulean rock"
[15:12:35] <Obormot\Gaia> *Now* have they communicated?
[15:12:43] <synthmeat> even they have communicated - they've selected amongst infinity of concepts and collapsed it into one of two
[15:12:52] <Obormot\Gaia> Is the answer yes in the first case, no in the second? The reverse? Yes in both, no in both? Etc.
[15:12:55] <Obormot\Gaia> It's not obvious!
[15:13:03] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: to be clear, my model is totally fine with people failing to communicate all the time.
[15:13:13] <feep[work]> for lots of reasons.-
[15:13:46] <feep[work]> I haven't talked about that part because I was more interested in success cases.
[15:13:58] <feep[work]> ie. how communication *can* happen, rather than how it, frequently, doesn't.
[15:14:02] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: Well, you started this branch of it... :p
[15:14:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway uh don't you have to get back to work or w/e
[15:14:35] <feep[work]> yes!
[15:14:40] <feep[work]> which is why I was like "stop! stop"

[18:14:43] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: so, you, naive reader, load /Clippy. a little 'book' icon is in the upper right in a little theme toggle, which you ignore as a lazy reader with web PTSD; it goes away as you get to business. it's a fun SF story. you read it to the end. suddenly, blam, the page is filled with links and the icon disappears, replaced briefly by the theme toggle, now with the book icon crossed...
[18:14:49] <gwern> ...out (or something). you follow links and become a gwern.net addict, eventually hovering over the theme toggle to learn what it does. the book icon is 'reader mode', apparently. you happen to be reading the anime book, and toggle it for reader mode. then go elsewhere to a links page and untoggle it etc.
[18:15:10] <galambo> gwern, whoa this is an amazing website. how come I never came across it before?
[18:15:27] <gwern> galambo: it's pretty specialized. if you aren't downloading ML datasets, why would you?
[18:16:22] <galambo> theres like a dataset of 11000 xrays. are these xrays reported or are they just images?
[18:16:59] <gwern> no idea. I've seen both. idea is you can use the raw images for generative modeling or self-supervised pretraining purposes

[18:18:13] <gwern> (similarly, there will be a fair number of datasets that come with a small set of hand-labeled images plus a 10-100x larger set of unlabeled raw images. the idea is that you ought to be able to train a NN to do *something* with the raw images, and then specialize it on the small labeled dataset to do better than training only on the small labeled dataset)
[18:18:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It's a plausible story - we'll see how it works out as I move the implementation to there... one hitch that I've already noticed is that, e.g. on /Clippy, by the time you scroll to "See Also", the text (with links) is almost scrolled off screen, so there's really no "blam"
[18:20:01] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: hm. this is with a relatively small vertical screen, I take it? so at the top of the screen you're at 'A thousand times' and then the rest is 1 month / 1 year / see also or something narrow ike that?

[18:22:02] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: maybe the intersection observer can be loosened? iirc, it lets you fire when the target elements aren't yet onscreen, similar to how lazy images start loading before the actual spot becomes visible
[18:22:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, sure it's visible, *if you stop scrolling precisely when the "See Also" heading scrolls into view* and scroll no further - but who does that? That's not standard user behavior
[18:22:51] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: ok fine fine, I can stick a '#reader-mode-disable-when-here' span/div at the bottom of '# 1 Week'
[18:23:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And yes it can be loosened, though this is exacerbated in this case by (a) the last *several* paragraphs of body text having no links at all, (b) those three sun rules gobbling up v-space...

[19:31:28] <PapuaHardyNet> "In 2055, you will ask a 10,000,000X-sized neural net megabrain to perform some task by speaking (or thinking) to it in English. And if you ask nicely enough, it will oblige. Yes you could train a neural net too… but why would you?" karpathy's timeline for automation of AI researchers is ridiculously short. The Katja Grace 2017 paper, for comparison, showed a prediction of 2100s for 50%+ probability
[19:32:26] <gwern> that's not ridiculous. karpathy is just saying 'we'll do what we do right now with GPT-3, CLIP, or Codex/AlphaCode, but it'll be so much better you won't need to edit it'
[19:33:46] <PapuaHardyNet> steelmanned, but I agree with the steelman, yeah
[19:35:04] <gwern> is it a steelman? karpathy has been a big advocate of prompt programming
[19:36:06] <PapuaHardyNet> news to me
[19:38:05] <nshepperd2> i expect us to all be turned by paperclips by 2055
[19:38:16] <nshepperd2> certainly long before the 2100s
[19:39:34] <gwern> yes. it's just very very hard for me to imagine a world in which I've scaled up GPT-3+CLIP+MuZero+everything-else using 10,000,000X the compute and... am still just puttering around asking the giant brain 'oh could you write a list reverser in python thanks'
[19:41:14] <bildramer> *writes a subagent program that reverses every list in every written medium*
[19:44:16] <gwern> nshepperd2: oh, random math question maybe you would know: if I have an exponentially growing number, what percentage of each time unit is the sum of all previous steps? that is, if AI compute runs double in size every 18 months, I think you can say something like "all compute spent by humanity on AI to date in the previous 18-month units is only X% of the current 18-month's FLOPS". what's...
[19:44:22] <gwern> ...100% -> X%?
[19:44:46] <gwern> is it just 100%?
[19:45:37] <gwern> because the previous t-1 step/unit is 50% of the current step/unit by definition (it 'doubles'), the prior one to that t-2 is 25%, the t-3 is 12.5%...
[19:46:42] <gwern> so my guess is that 50% + 25% + 12.5% + 6.25% ... = 100%
[19:51:54] <bildramer> that's indeed true, if something k-tuples every n-month period, (k-1)/k of it happened during the last n-month period - maybe not the exact reasoning you used, but you can make it work
[19:53:09] <gwern> yeah, that would be my next question. if we know compute doubles every 18 months, then if clippy becomes the biggest run for 1 month, what is X% now? then, if we assume clippy seized 1000x the resources and did a one-off spike, what is X%?
[19:55:00] <gwern> my intuition is that it gives me a line like "Thus, of the compute spent researching AI to date, humanity has spent 5%; Clippy is the other 95%"
[19:58:08] <bildramer> I'm not sure I parsed that right, but if the 18-month double time is right, then the last 1 month is 3.78% of all compute ever, and if the last month is 1000x larger, it's 97.5% I think, actually smaller than I expected
[19:58:52] <bildramer> and the calculation is (2^(1/18)-1)/2^(1/18), or 1000(2^(1/18)-1) / (1000(2^(1/18)-1)+1)
[19:58:55] <bildramer> respectively

[20:04:12] <bildramer> for small values like 1/18 things like 2^(1/18) are approximately equal to 1+ln(2)/18, or in other words the growth rate at month zero is ln(2) (0.69) and then "naive" calculation gives ln(2)/(18+ln(2)) is 3.71% - but in this case this overcomplicates things, I think
[20:13:17] <bildramer> but yeah if you had thought of all of this in advance you could have done 693/(693+18) = approx 97.5%

[21:37:13] <ggreer> the only reason he didn't get deported is because his haters were incompetent. still his career is ruined and he's constantly harassed by students
[21:37:58] <PapuaHardyNet> "One former student described Jaeger in an interview as "super smart but not great at reading the room. He didn't like filtering himself." And so he didn't." Above average social skills are a survival necessity.
[21:39:16] <PapuaHardyNet> "He dated or slept with several students in his early years as a professor at U.R., although none worked in his lab or were under his tutelage. This was, at the time, permitted under departmental policy, but this once-common practice is now taboo, perhaps guaranteed to cause problems for both the professor and for his or her students. Jaeger says he sees that now, but in his early 30s, to him, it seemed normal." So his overconfidence 
[21:39:16] <PapuaHardyNet> was his downfall.
[21:42:09] <gwern> many such cases
[21:43:20] <gwern> YOUTH BLOGGER: "I know of another example of a powerful white man whose overconfidence was his downfall... That's right, Vladimir Putin." THE KIDS: "Booo!" YOUTH BLOGGER: "Yes, get thee behind me, Putin!"
[21:45:26] <PapuaHardyNet> "Jaeger, along with others in the meeting, argued back that it was both illegal and unethical to discuss Rucci's relationship. [...] Aslin was apparently appalled by this revelation, and later emailed Cantlon that he was "disgusted and angry" and would "not let this rest until [Jaeger] is out of the [department]."" So what happened is that a woman decided to use his less than politically correct relationship history to take revenge for 
[21:45:26] <PapuaHardyNet> not supporting her political campaign.
[21:46:28] <PapuaHardyNet> She didn't just use his history, but she started smearing his reputation by spreading rumors. "Cantlon, now with Aslin in her corner, started poking around for stories about Jaeger, contacting graduate students and telling them that there had been a complaint made against him by "current students." This was false. None of his current students complained, but no matter; eventually the rumor spread all around the department, from 
[21:46:28] <PapuaHardyNet> students and postdocs to faculty and staff and back again."
[21:46:30] <ggreer> yeah. although jaeger is correct in his argument. you cannot discuss marital status in a hiring decision
[21:46:47] <ggreer> it's one of the protected categories, like race, sex, military history, etc
[21:49:41] <PapuaHardyNet> "Meanwhile, Cantlon and Aslin continued to try to recruit new accusers despite instructions from the Office of Counsel to keep the investigation confidential. In an email sent on March 20, 2016, Aslin told Cantlon that while he had been instructed not to talk about the investigation, he was going to speak about it anyway, adding, "We need troops on our side."" wow

[21:54:52] <gwern> 'In one instance, the complainants said that a former student whom Jaeger dated cried in a professor's office, implying that her distress was over the relationship. When investigators interviewed the woman, she told them that she was crying because her sister had been in a car accident.'
[21:57:09] <PapuaHardyNet> this narrative is surprisingly complex. so Cantlon decides to take revenge for Jaeger not supporting her politically, lies and gets Aslin on her side, Aslin blindly white knights, and both find a willing "victim" in a woman who was jealous of Jaeger's relationship with his girlfriend in the past. It took three people in places of power together working nonstop, to take him down.

[22:06:04] <PapuaHardyNet> What could Jaeger have done to prevent this? (1) He could have not been a cad. (2) he could have been more diplomatic with his colleagues, knowing the power they held over his career. I don't think he could have done much once the process began, though. Once Aslin was involved, it was all over - Aslin sounds like a nutcase.
[22:09:04] <gwern> that's the chilling effect. imagine going around terrified, squeaking like a mouse, your entire life because someone 10 or 20 years later might drag it up, lie about it, and destroy you
[22:12:53] <PapuaHardyNet> The better your social skills are, the more leeway you have in taking social risks and getting away with it. So less "chilling effect" and more "git gud at social skills".
[22:13:35] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess my point 1 should then be "he should have been a more skilled cad" instead of "he should not have been a cad".
[22:14:04] <gwern> he hardly even sounds like a cad. dating a student elsewhere? walking into an office and writing on a post-it?!
[22:16:49] <PapuaHardyNet> the kernel of truth his accusers latched onto was the fact that he dated multiple students. Plus, they found a student of his who was intensely angry at being rejected. managing the emotions of this woman, and ensuring that he communicates enough to not make certain students uncomfortable is not that hard.
[22:17:16] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, it is unfair, but he wouldn't have had any other choice anyway.

[23:45:46] <ggreer> obviously it takes immense willpower to resist food all the time, so other lifestyle changes (like eating in certain ways or eating certain foods that provide more satiety per calorie) are a good idea
