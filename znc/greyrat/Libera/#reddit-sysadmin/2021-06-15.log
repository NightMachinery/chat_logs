[05:53:31] <yuken> I'm not allowed to buy handguns, and typically in the US the regulated part for handguns is the frame.
[05:53:32] <e1> yuken: that's cute
[05:53:37] <yuken> So I have every part other than thef rame, and I basically need to...
[05:53:44] <yuken> reverse engineer the dimensions. With no frame to base it off of.
[05:53:46] <e1> You're not allowed to buy a gun but you can download a gun?
[05:53:51] <yuken> AKA. Google Images and luck.
[05:53:59] <yuken> yes, e1. I am allowed to build one, and possess the handgun.
[05:54:03] <yuken> But I can not buy one.
[05:54:17] <e1> =.=
[05:54:28] <Cl0udNinja> uhg... wow.. I opened my front door for literally 2 minutes and the temperature in my place skyrocketed :( all that trouble cooling my place gone almost instantly
[05:54:34] <yuken> e1, federal law prohibits those under 21 from buying handguns from a licensed dealer. It also prohibits those under 18 from possessing a handgun (which is currently being fought agains, both of them).
[05:54:55] <yuken> It is up to state law to determine whether they want to have their own minimum age requirements - my state requires 21+ for private sales.
[05:55:08] <e1> Is this venturing into politics?
[05:55:12] <yuken> And travelling out of state is illegal, you can only buy guns in private sales in your own state unless you bring them through a licensed dealer.
[05:55:24] <yuken> narh e1
[05:55:29] <e1> Okay cool
[05:55:42] <yuken> So, since I can't travel out of state to do it, and I can't buy one in a private sale in-state, I had to figure out another way to do it.
[05:55:43] <e1> Min age of purchase @ 21 not co-inciding with min age of carry @ 18 makes zero sense
[05:55:55] <yuken> e1, minimum age to obtain conceal carry license in my state _is_ 21.
[05:56:14] <e1> There's a three year gap that lets people possess, and I presume open/conceal carry, but thye can't buy it, so they'll end up carrying and potentially using a weapon not registered to them? :\
[05:56:21] <yuken> I have a license from another state. When these laws were written, we didn't have reciprocity with any other state, and easily homemade 3D printed frames weren't really a thing.
[05:56:27] <yuken> e1, there is no registry.
[05:56:30] <yuken> No such thing in the US.
[05:56:34] <e1> lol really
[05:56:37] <yuken> yes.
[05:56:41] <e1> wow..
[05:56:52] <yuken> e1, the intention of state law is that no one below 21 can own a handgun, or conceal carry a handgun, at all.
[05:57:06] <yuken> If you wanted to before now, you'd have to do some pretty tough metalworking basically.
[05:57:16] <yuken> But now you can just order an 80% kit, or 3D print it, or do a CNC mill, etc.
[05:57:31] <e1> True, I guess it is a pretty new issue
[05:57:53] <yuken> e1, and my state doesn't issue conceal carry licenses to <21 (open carry has no minimum age), but it recognizes licenses from several states that do, including non-residents.
[05:57:58] <e1> The whole thing sounds really jank from the perspective of a country where it's super regulated

[05:58:24] <yuken> I basically just sent in a form that says "giev me my license", they gave me a license in the mail.
[05:58:32] <yuken> Didn't even need to send them my ID.
[05:58:43] <e1> jesus
[05:58:57] <yuken> New Hampshire is a permitless conceal carry state now, they just have the license for legacy reasons.
[05:59:05] <yuken> actually, I think 22 US states are now permitless.
[05:59:26] <e1> I thought fed was pushing states to heavily restrict firearms
[05:59:39] <yuken> hell no.
[05:59:47] <yuken> Like, 13 states are saying "we won't enforce federal firearms laws."
[06:00:00] <yuken> And feds can't do shit lol.
[06:00:11] <e1> america is a funny place
[06:00:16] <xe0n> sad
[06:00:17] <xe0n> lol
[06:00:26] <e1> eh, it's a cultural thing at this point
[06:00:39] <yuken> e1, so basically, in the US, the federal government's powers are what is defined here: https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/
[06:00:42] <e1> I dont disagree with it, especially considering that regulating weapons wont have a good effect for decades
[06:00:53] <yuken> They have the power to do that stuff, as well as enforce the constitutional amendments.
[06:01:07] <yuken> A lot of what they're doing (drug laws, gun laws, etc) aren't actually powers they should have under our founding documents.
[06:01:10] <e1> But I mean.. America is basically a bunch of tiny countries all rpetending to be a single country right?

[06:01:32] <e1> ernix: gooooood luck
[06:01:51] <Cl0udNinja> e1, the US is a bit like europe, except countries are states
[06:01:55] <Cl0udNinja> and theres more of them
[06:02:00] <yuken> e1, no guns are actually able to be banned, at a federal level, in states in the United States. For example, there are several states where Ic an move to, and legally build machine guns a-okay. Rather, they say that the interstate commerce of such items is illegal without federal permission.
[06:02:07] <yuken> But, what they count as "interstate commerce" is uhhh...
[06:02:16] <yuken> "you bought the tools to make this gun from a manufacturer who is out of state. Interstate commerce."
[06:02:42] <e1> Yeah, it's all so convoluted
[06:02:45] <yuken> "You actually made everything yourself, from raw materials harvested in the state, by yourself? Well uhhhh... you didn't buy stuff from out of state, therefore you affected interstate commerce!"
[06:02:50] <e1> and now we're bordering politics
[06:03:01] <yuken> That's how they try to enforce it, at least.
[06:03:46] <e1> Well, at least you get to 3d print your own gun :) that's actually pretty cool
[06:04:12] <xe0n> no, it's not.

[06:05:18] <ernix> Cl0udNinja, you should see how dangerous it is in Australia... we've been 3d printing boomerangs for over a decade
[06:05:30] <e1> it's kinda hilarious to see multi million dollar drug dealers working with antiques, but hey
[06:05:31] <yuken> It's no different from any other polymer handgun, except it's FDM rather than injection molded.
[06:05:57] <Cl0udNinja> yeah you dont realize the difference in structure between fdm and injection molded?!
[06:05:58] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[06:06:00] <yuken> e1, these modern 3D printed designs, and I mean completely from scratch (as in, easily accessible in Australia), are much much better than any antique.

[06:06:40] <yuken> e1, https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E13hyjzWUAAv0S0?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
[06:06:49] <yuken> none of the parts used there are actually regulated in Australia (the precursors).
[06:06:58] <yuken> Cl0udNinja, sure I do. It doesn't really matter here.
[06:07:10] <yuken> The parts that need to be are still metal.
[06:07:43] <Cl0udNinja> and what holds all of that metal together? oh right, the plastic around it
[06:07:51] <yuken> ...and?
[06:07:53] <Cl0udNinja> and what happens when plastic gets hot? it gets melty and pliable
[06:08:13] <yuken> I mean... when you're talking about that, that'll happen with injection molded too.
[06:08:18] <Cl0udNinja> injection molded plastic forms differently and is much stronger than a layer by layer of half melted plastic
[06:08:23] <yuken> uh-huh.
[06:08:37] <e1> I mean.. it's not like this is a comp shooter weapon
[06:08:41] <e1> It's a SNS
[06:08:44] <yuken> And the people who fire thousands upon thousands of rounds through these don't care, Cl0udNinja.
[06:08:50] <yuken> Literally thousands upon thousands.
[06:08:58] <yuken> "omg but melt plastic!"
[06:09:15] <yuken> If an AK receiver lasts 4000+ rounds, a handgun will last infinitely longer.
[06:09:24] <xe0n> so anyway...
[06:09:41] <ernix> how about that long weekend
[06:09:46] <ernix> that was fun
[06:09:48] <yuken> what long weekend o-O
[06:10:42] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> My last car engine was partially made of thermoplastic. It was fine for well over ten years. (Then I needed new plastic, but hey.)
[06:11:10] <yuken> People severely overestimate how hot, or how much force, small rifles (5.56x45 and such), and handguns, exert and create.
[06:11:14] <xe0n> yeah we had a long weekend too :D
[06:11:22] <xe0n> show day on friday
[06:11:28] <yuken> This isn't a 50 BMG rifle or an anti-tank gun.
[06:11:33] <ernix> I ended up with leftover pizza and home made enchiladas
[06:11:35] <xe0n> yuken we'v emoved on
[06:11:46] <xe0n> shut up about guns, if you want to talk about them, pm the person
[06:11:51] <yuken> I
[06:11:53] <yuken> I can't PM them they're on Discord
[06:11:58] <ernix> shoot 'em a pm
[06:12:00] <e1> ffs that was a long weekend
[06:12:01] <ernix> (hehe)
[06:12:06] <e1> I have so much TOIL built up now -.-
[06:12:12] <yuken> e1, tf is TOIL
[06:12:24] <xe0n> e1: was your area included in the pub holiday, i thought you guys had already had show day
[06:12:26] <e1> I was meant to be taking all this leave off from work because I have WAYYYY too much built up in both TOIL and annual... :\
[06:12:31] <xe0n> dont think your area was
[06:12:39] <xe0n> was more marooch > up north
[06:12:40] <Cl0udNinja> wtf is show day
[06:12:41] <e1> idk $boss will probably just assume
[06:12:51] <e1> yuken: Time off in Leui
[06:13:01] <e1> Instead of being paid for over time I get to take time off for the time worked
[06:13:04] <yuken> hmmm.
[06:13:11] <xe0n> Cl0udNinja: we have district carnival things
[06:13:15] <xe0n> and they run from fri-sun
[06:13:23] <xe0n> so they give some people in the area the day off on friday to attend the show
[06:13:25] <e1> It's handy, I'd rather get a day off over $100 or $200 in my pay check for that time
[06:13:39] <e1> which is stupid because... why divide between north and south
[06:13:40] <xe0n> pub holiday you get paid for anyway...
[06:13:40] <xe0n> lol
[06:13:49] <e1> I dont get paid for pub holiday
[06:13:56] <e1> With the rsoter and the contract I dont get paid extra for coming in
[06:13:57] <xe0n> we all do! its the fucking law
[06:14:00] <e1> Given our industry
[06:14:04] <xe0n> LOL
[06:14:18] <e1> Sucks but it makes sense
[06:14:33] <yuken> oh shit
[06:14:34] <Cl0udNinja> I miss being in a datacenter and 'hourly'
[06:14:38] <yuken> that's some heavy rain and a lot of lightning
[06:15:00] <Cl0udNinja> everyone hated working on the holidays but I didnt mind, boss would always offer me 2x to 2.5x time because I'd agree to work that day
[06:15:16] <ernix>  I don't know how I get paid anymore... "the network is up, you get paid"
[06:15:25] <yuken> It seems like you can just kinda, treat another day as your holiday Cl0udNinja.
[06:15:32] <e1> ernix: someone needs to tell my managers that
[06:15:35] <yuken> "oh I work for 2x today and can just do my real holiday next week"
[06:15:45] <Cl0udNinja> yuken, nah, I'd just keep working my normal shifts
[06:15:47] <e1> I got taken off the support calls... so like... why am i here
[06:16:00] <Cl0udNinja> holidays were so easy
[06:16:14] <Cl0udNinja> no one would call or open tickets unless it was like thanksgiving because black friday
[06:16:35] <Cl0udNinja> get paid 2.5x for 12 hours to fuck around on the internet at the office
[06:16:39] <e1> Cl0udNinja: do you miss embargos over christmas tho?
[06:16:53] <e1> That's one thing I really miss, super quiet around the christmas/nye period in the office, then a couple weeks forced time off
[06:17:17] <Cl0udNinja> never had to deal with that, was a hosting company and we hosted a lot of different industries so there was always someone making a change
[06:17:39] <e1> mm true
[06:18:01] <e1> host i worked for didnt' require us to be in the office tho which was nice
[06:18:22] <Cl0udNinja> we had to because it was a physical dc
[06:18:59] <e1> Yeah, understandable
[06:19:27] <Cl0udNinja> I really do kinda miss workin at that place, easy graveyard work and the nightlife around was always fun to watch. most of my nights were spent sitting in my car getting high and watching the alert board through our ipad and monitoring the phone through the oncall secondary phone
[06:20:14] <e1> lmao dc work looks super cushy. One of those "when shit hits the fan" kinda jobs but still, seems super easy going
[06:20:23] <Cl0udNinja> it is
[06:20:39] <Cl0udNinja> the physical labor part sucks, but its a good way to stay active
[06:21:32] <PrincessZoey> MikeSpears: should hire me whenever he gets big :p
[06:21:42] <e1> MikeSpears /is/ big
[06:21:43] <Cl0udNinja> the worst of the labor part I had to deal with was a customer requesting an emergency racking of a 4U storage array, on my own
[06:21:44] <e1> ;)
[06:21:57] <PrincessZoey> E1 no shit lol. I lived with him xD
[06:21:58] <e1> Cl0udNinja: been there, no picnic
[06:22:02] <Cl0udNinja> (4U full of disks, multi row)
[06:22:04] <e1> PrincessZoey: :O
[06:22:45] <Cl0udNinja> asshole customer also wanted it EXACTLY in the middle of the rack, without a server lift
[06:23:26] <e1> haha yeah... I put 6 ru full syno into a rack by myself once and had to squish it between some audio gear
[06:23:34] <PublicWiFi> updating my resume sucks
[06:23:35] <e1> That's how I learned how heavy audio gear is :\
[06:23:59] <Cl0udNinja> "Ill just lift this equipment up 1U to make some room"
[06:24:05] <Cl0udNinja> "I've made a terrible mistake"
[06:24:09] <e1> hahahaha
[06:24:12] <e1> fucking ay yeah
[06:24:29] <e1> but you've already got it unscrewedso you're kinda just... stuck
[06:24:33] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[06:24:53] <e1> Can't re-rack into original position, not enough weetbix eaten to lift it that extra ru
[06:25:03] <e1> noone can hear you scream for help over the aircon..
[06:25:10] <Cl0udNinja> I wish we had a server lift
[06:25:21] <Cl0udNinja> every place I've worked has always been brute force
[06:26:04] <MikeSpears> e1 PrincessZoey be quiet lol

[06:29:04] <MikeSpears> I'm waiting to find out my start date for Penske. 
[06:29:07] <MikeSpears> I'm still at netgate
[06:29:10] <MikeSpears> it's been a year
[06:29:12] <MikeSpears> lmfao
[06:29:25] <e1> what's a penske
[06:29:39] <MikeSpears> a very large company that does trucking, logistics and other shit
[06:29:44] <e1> ahk
[06:29:47] <PublicWiFi> fuck boys
[06:29:54] <MikeSpears> gonna be a sysadmin over there
[06:29:55] <e1> yeah .. netgate doesn't seem like a super big competitor in the space...
[06:30:01] <PublicWiFi> me job description at my currnet job is almost the same as my last
[06:30:08] <PublicWiFi> so wtf do I put on the bullet points lol
[06:30:10] <e1> They should really be sucking the dicks of prosumer but I'm not spending 2-3k for a pfsense box
[06:30:11] <PublicWiFi> the same shit?
[06:30:22] <e1> which I dont think i can really even get in Aus anyway :\
[06:30:29] <xe0n> yeah you can lol!
[06:30:34] <e1> Not really
[06:30:41] <xe0n> eh yeah? you order one?
[06:30:45] <xe0n> ive seen them...
[06:30:46] <xe0n> LOL
[06:30:50] <e1> I've seen them too
[06:30:51] <MikeSpears> there's partners in AU
[06:30:57] <e1> too frequently with 'out of stock' in the description
[06:31:02] <MikeSpears> also you can order directly from netgate
[06:31:09] <e1> Still expensive af
[06:31:10] <Cl0udNinja> PublicWiFi, thats why I changed my resume format up
[06:31:21] <PublicWiFi> what'd you end up doing?
[06:31:25] <Cl0udNinja> List work history in a table (title, location, dates)
[06:31:38] <e1> oh mad, I /just/ saw the sg-1100
[06:31:42] <e1> I retract all my previous statements.
[06:31:44] <Cl0udNinja> and then below that a big table list of all the shit I've done across every job thats relevant to the position
[06:31:48] <PublicWiFi> hmmmm
[06:31:59] <MikeSpears> don't get the 1100
[06:32:01] <Cl0udNinja> my resume is already long, but that cut it down a lot
[06:32:05] <e1> AANNDDDDD no AU plug
[06:32:08] <MikeSpears> 2100 is the lowest I'd suggest
[06:32:14] <e1> bbl
[06:32:28] <MikeSpears> iirc if you order from au, they'll provide an AU plug
[06:32:29] <MikeSpears> ask
[06:32:33] <xe0n> yeah...
[06:32:34] <xe0n> lol
[06:32:40] <MikeSpears> ask sales
[06:33:15] <Cl0udNinja> PublicWiFi, unfortunately I do still have to keep a broken up list because some people are sticklers for that format, but generally the format has been pretty well received
[06:33:25] <PublicWiFi> this is like
[06:33:36] <PublicWiFi> this job that came over is a once-in-a-generation type deal lol
[06:33:41] <PublicWiFi> so old grey beard finally died or something
[06:33:44] <PublicWiFi> I gotta get this right xDD
[06:38:52] <xe0n> once in a generation
[06:38:53] <xe0n> lol!
[06:39:09] <PublicWiFi> im telling you lol

[10:09:05] <A-KO> but RSUs are 'income'
[10:09:09] <A-KO> so it pushed my W-2 > 200K
[10:09:14] <e1> Ahh I see
[10:09:25] <e1> my initial reactino was surprise that your company would offer equity
[10:09:25] <A-KO> still not bad
[10:09:32] <e1> but i mean.. that's just 100% consistent..

[10:10:13] <JollyRgrs> and you said we were being mean?
[10:10:17] <A-KO> so I have to be here for the vest--every 6 months

[10:11:46] <e1> no...
[10:12:12] <e1> A-KO: is that a triple digit share price im seeing...
[10:12:25] <JollyRgrs> and once you do, you can buy me a 3090 right?
[10:12:40] <A-KO> it is a triple digit share price, yes
[10:12:41] <e1> A-KO: is buying 3090's for all of us
[10:12:44] <A-KO> but these are before tax numbers
[10:12:45] <A-KO> like

[10:12:50] <A-KO> taxes RAKE ME OVER THE FUCKING COALS for shares

[10:13:23] <barred_owl> he would not shut up about that
[10:13:28] <e1> JollyRgrs: oh i was looking at the share price..
[10:13:32] <A-KO> but I really want to hold onto the shares
[10:13:43] <e1> A-KO: uh yeah i would..
[10:13:46] <A-KO> I need a really sweet deal to get me to leave the company tbh
[10:13:54] <A-KO> I've not sold anything I've gotten so far
[10:14:10] <A-KO> we're talking much higher base pay, and a signing bonus, and equity realistically
[10:14:11] <e1> Do they pay dividends?
[10:14:18] <A-KO> not yet?
[10:14:28] <A-KO> I think the share price is currently massively undervalued
[10:14:29] <e1> if/when they do, you'll be loving life
[10:14:40] <A-KO> so I'm expecting a 3-5x return in share price tbh

[10:16:12] <A-KO> but, I don't think that's a work thing
[10:16:14] <e1> that's surprising to hear
[10:16:15] <A-KO> I think I'm just bored in general
[10:16:28] <barred_owl> JollyRgrs, i never was on freenode
[10:16:30] <e1> yep, i'm with you on that one
[10:16:31] <A-KO> it's not that like I don't have enough work to do, or stuff to do. I'm like....I need something to challenge my brain
[10:16:37] <JollyRgrs> barred_owl: how'd you run into m4221?
[10:16:40] <A-KO> so that's the issue
[10:16:43] <JollyRgrs> #bearcave on efnet?
[10:16:46] <gibby> barred_owl: yeah none of the ops recognize you so...
[10:16:49] <A-KO> m4221 does not live in Seattle lol
[10:16:51] <A-KO> there's no way in hell
[10:17:06] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: if he is living in a rented cardboard box (half-wet)
[10:17:11] <A-KO> ^
[10:17:18] <A-KO> I'd rather live in a cardboard box in LA tbh
[10:17:19] <e1> Yep, I'm in a position where I'm not super engaged with the work that I'm doing, I'd like to do something a little more interesting. But it's really hard for most companies to compare because I know what's waiting at the next company, wich is not much

[10:17:34] <A-KO> indeed e1. Which is why the MS position is so enticing
[10:17:38] <A-KO> it actually could be really interesting
[10:17:41] <A-KO> and challenge me
[10:17:43] <e1> Yeah, it would keep oyu engaged for a little while
[10:17:46] <A-KO> like in a completely new, different way
[10:17:53] <e1> What do you do exactly?
[10:17:55] <barred_owl> JollyRgrs, efnet and 2600net
[10:17:56] <e1> Guessing not generic sysadmin
[10:18:12] <A-KO> I'm a Windows/AD/Identity/O365/Whatever-the-fuck architect, basically
[10:18:29] <A-KO> Everything from Infrastructure-As-Code, to designing authentication, to all of the above
[10:18:33] <e1> Ahk, I get where you slot in
[10:18:39] <jay-ros> Do you know how to powershell?
[10:18:43] <A-KO> sadly
[10:18:45] <e1> fuck off jay-ros hahahaha
[10:18:47] <A-KO> I actually really do *like* those things
[10:18:50] <JollyRgrs> barred_owl: so he's built up a reputation all around the internet ,eh?
[10:18:52] <A-KO> but I'm bored
[10:18:52] <A-KO> like
[10:18:58] <A-KO> I figured out DSC stuff, and now I'm not interested anymore
[10:19:02] <A-KO> so my brain is like
[10:19:05] <A-KO> "oh, that's lame. next."
[10:19:24] <jay-ros> yeah I'm still trying to work out if i should spend more than four seconds on DSC
[10:19:29] <A-KO> I did
[10:19:32] <barred_owl> JollyRgrs, oddly, yeah, but for technical competence
[10:19:33] <A-KO> I actually really like it
[10:19:33] <jay-ros> signs point to no
[10:19:38] <JollyRgrs> i always try to find out if someone has a desire to challenge their brain, those are usually the best
[10:19:40] <A-KO> there are limits, but I actually am really happy with it
[10:19:48] <JollyRgrs> the only downside, if you don't keep challenging them... you'll lose them
[10:19:51] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:19:58] <jay-ros> yeah? how much is it to kick off
[10:20:03] <A-KO> not much at all
[10:20:04] <A-KO> not much at all
[10:20:06] <A-KO> super fucking easy
[10:20:21] <jay-ros> righto, might look at it for this task
[10:20:36] <e1> ELI5; dsc
[10:20:38] <e1> save me a google
[10:20:44] <A-KO> powershell desired state configuration
[10:20:44] <jay-ros> lazily swapping out the 4 x 1gbe nics for 2 x 10gbe and building weighted vmnics on a vm switch
[10:20:48] <JollyRgrs> basically it's just defining PS scripts to run in place of GPOs right?
[10:20:52] <e1> er ansible?
[10:20:55] <A-KO> yeah, more or less.
[10:20:58] <e1> ew
[10:20:59] <jay-ros> on six servers, worth the "I want this" time
[10:21:02] <e1> what was wrong with gpos
[10:21:17] <JollyRgrs> yeah, obv. a bit more polished as a "config mgmt" tool, but not much iirc
[10:21:29] <A-KO> so, I'm not a huge ansible person tbh. What I don't like is the orchestration of the way it works. I actually like DSC a little bit better from a design perspective, but the surrounding tooling is absolute trash.
[10:21:31] <JollyRgrs> e1: well, for 1... free Hyper-V servers that can't be joined to a domain
[10:21:32] <jay-ros> a step below SCORCH, right?
[10:21:38] <A-KO> But if you can figure out the surrounding tooling for DSC, you're golden
[10:22:18] <e1> JollyRgrs: so you dont need to be on ad for dsc?
[10:22:19] <A-KO> DSC has next to no...host management. And I'm finding myself running into that problem. You can lean on 3rd party tools like Chef if needed. Or you could kind of design your own.
[10:22:28] <JollyRgrs> e1: trhat's kind of the point of DSC is that it works off-domain
[10:22:37] <A-KO> but the "linking systems to configuration" is the part DSC isn't great...
[10:22:41] <A-KO> DSC does work off domain, yes.
[10:22:42] <barred_owl> ansible is nice that it does not require an agent
[10:22:49] <e1> so you write some scripts to configure windows, then push it out
[10:22:51] <A-KO> with DSC, the agent is built-in.
[10:22:55] <A-KO> it's called the LCM
[10:22:55] <e1> much like how ansible does it
[10:23:01] <e1> also ansible requires python, rsync 
[10:23:01] <A-KO> e1: it can do push or pull
[10:23:05] <e1> A-KO: mmm okay
[10:23:14] <e1> I have some reservationsthere but i'll keep them to myself
[10:23:22] <e1> because it's a really positive step forward
[10:23:50] <A-KO> Ansible's windows management is basically trash. It's basically a massive combination of WinRM and psexec
[10:23:53] <A-KO> which.....is garbage
[10:24:05] <e1> Well yeah windows was hacked into ansible
[10:24:09] <barred_owl> A-KO, try it where it's intended, linux
[10:24:14] <e1> Noone gives a fuck about windows in ansible land, sorry
[10:24:16] <A-KO> well sure, for linux I'm cool with it.
[10:24:19] <A-KO> uh
[10:24:22] <A-KO> Want to hear a story?
[10:24:32] <e1> no but ill read it
[10:24:32] <JollyRgrs> barred_owl: you should try SCCM on linux!
[10:24:33] <A-KO> We had a hardcore linux/cloud/ansible guy swear to god he could build blizzcon with ansible by himself
[10:24:39] <A-KO> I am not lying
[10:24:42] <A-KO> btw, he failed
[10:24:45] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[10:24:51] <JollyRgrs> haha
[10:24:58] <e1> build.. blizzcon?
[10:24:59] <barred_owl> JollyRgrs, is it free to download?
[10:25:01] <A-KO> yes
[10:25:04] <JollyRgrs> barred_owl: actually, yes
[10:25:14] <JollyRgrs> and free to run if you don't think you'll be audited...
[10:25:19] <e1> in what sense A-KO 
[10:25:30] <A-KO> He ended up creating what he called "yolo" scripts, because what he had architected in his fucking lab didn't scale to the convention floor itself due to how volatile the network/systems are when setting up a convention in 4 days
[10:25:33] <barred_owl> does anyone use ctera edge gateways?
[10:25:50] <e1> loool
[10:25:53] <jay-ros> A-KO, was this in a hotel room on a laptop?
[10:26:03] <jay-ros> I've heard a similar story :P
[10:26:11] <A-KO> e1: Blizzcon takes over an entire convention center and has a massive scale-out of desktop systems for people to play game demos on. As you can imagine, it's wild, hectic, crazy, problematic. Lots going on.
[10:26:38] <A-KO> They basically teach folks to patch network cables day of and say "go forth, let's wire this place up in 4 fucking days."
[10:26:43] <A-KO> you can imagine how bad that is
[10:27:00] <e1> ohhhh okay that extra bit of context has put it into perspective
[10:27:09] <A-KO> anyways, this guy labbed it all out on a VM stack. He had lots of serialization going on, waiting for validation, etc.
[10:27:11] <A-KO> and ALL of that failed
[10:27:12] <A-KO> at the con

[10:27:39] <JollyRgrs> tell me there was a backup plan?
[10:27:49] <A-KO> yes JollyRgrs: me and the guy who did it previously in powershell
[10:27:51] <A-KO> which all worked great
[10:27:59] <A-KO> That dude and I were ninja powershelling on the fly to fix this dude's ansible issues
[10:28:01] <A-KO> he was furious
[10:28:01] <JollyRgrs> what?
[10:28:09] <JollyRgrs> using powershell to manage windows servers/workstations?
[10:28:13] <JollyRgrs> that's unheard of!
[10:28:13] <e1> JollyRgrs: how do i jump to window 12 quickly in weechat
[10:28:16] <barred_owl> A-KO, when was this?
[10:28:21] <A-KO> The linux guys swore they could do the entire con better than the windows guys who orchestrated the whole thing in powershell
[10:28:21] <JollyRgrs> e1: uh... /buffer 12
[10:28:26] <A-KO> 2018
[10:28:33] <e1> JollyRgrs: thank you <3
[10:28:37] <e1> i was doing /window
[10:28:47] <JollyRgrs> i think there's some keybinds but i only know 1-0....
[10:29:13] <e1> likewise :(
[10:29:22] <e1> A-KO: dude was way too ambitious 
[10:29:30] <e1> also.. ansible to install WoW on desktops or somethign? :|
[10:29:36] <e1> windows desktops i presume
[10:29:40] <A-KO> So one fun story was time. So some of the desktops came up with like a year 8601 date. Security mandated TLS everything--but desktops were coming online with the year 8601. And since they weren't allowed to NTP out (again, due to security)--they basically were stuck. Keep in mind, these were boxed systems that came from a vendor--fresh Windows image, like literally stock Windows. No 
[10:29:40] <A-KO> customizations for *anything* to prevent theft/leakage.
[10:29:48] <JollyRgrs> but yeah, i p much just keep my most important ones on 1-10 and after that, i just alt+arrow around to it, or I use my mouse
[10:29:49] <A-KO> So the ansible setup completely failed because these systems couldn't validate the TLS certs
[10:30:26] <e1> JollyRgrs: woah woah fancy guy with pointer integration
[10:30:42] <JollyRgrs> /mouse enable iirc :P
[10:30:55] <e1> JollyRgrs: that is life changing
[10:30:56] <JollyRgrs> but beware, the guestures
[10:31:14] <JollyRgrs> i had to disable the one for kick b/c if i click on a user and move left or right... it kicks or bans
[10:31:25] <JollyRgrs> i did that on accident a few times before disabling
[10:32:02] <e1> ooo guestures
[10:32:04] <e1> OOOOO
[10:32:09] <JollyRgrs> oh yeah dude
[10:32:10] <A-KO> but yeah. use the right tool for the job. I actually like DSC. The resource design is kind of a pain ; but it lets you get suuuuuper flexible with how you want the system to work. Most people using orchestration tools tend to use whatever's provided with the orchestration--and that probably goes for a lot of Windows stuff as well. But there's a lot more to configuring and managing 
[10:32:10] <A-KO> windows servers than dropping text files and reg keys. Something the linux tools don't handle well--at all
[10:32:22] <e1> I get super excited when ncurses apps do better than most gui aps
[10:32:24] <JollyRgrs> click in the chat and drag left or right and it'll move to next/prev buffer
[10:32:42] <JollyRgrs> scroll up/down with mouse wheel on user or topic to scroll it
[10:32:49] <JollyRgrs> e1: ikr?
[10:32:53] <e1> omg i can finally go through the nicklist
[10:32:57] <JollyRgrs> only thing that sucks is WSL can't handle weechat yet
[10:33:06] <e1> Sorry, bit of a detraction from what A-KO is saying here... but..
[10:33:13] <A-KO> WSL can't do weechat? what?
[10:33:15] <A-KO> since when?
[10:33:17] <JollyRgrs> e1: there's also keybinds for it... but I only remember... i think f11/f12 or f10/f11 to scroll topic
[10:33:29] <e1> The more and more I use my windows 10 system at home, the more and more I miss my Linux desktop, just because you can do sooooooo fucking much in nix that you can't do in windows
[10:33:41] <e1> Like mounting \\fs\01 and \\fs\02 with different credentials
[10:33:45] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: ok, so WSL can't ssh into my weechat box and display weechat without random chars locking on screen, etc.
[10:33:51] <A-KO> weird
[10:33:51] <JollyRgrs> it's like 93% there
[10:33:55] <A-KO> JollyRgrs: using Terminal?
[10:33:57] <e1> And i have to touch my mouse so little in nix that I've got it put off to the side...
[10:33:59] <JollyRgrs> i couldn't ever figure it out, so i just run Terminator
[10:34:02] <JollyRgrs> terminal is no better
[10:34:04] <JollyRgrs> i was hoping it would be
[10:34:04] <A-KO> interesting
[10:34:11] <A-KO> I wonder what the issue is there
[10:34:19] <e1> And when I see placed like the motor registry and mechanics move over to windows + gui from nix/mac + terminal app, you can see them slow up 
[10:34:22] <JollyRgrs> e1: same for me... but on windows atm
[10:34:23] <A-KO> Terminal should be mostly fully fledged out on the ANSI code stuff these days
[10:34:25] <JollyRgrs> you just gotta git gud
[10:34:34] <e1> I am gud, I still hate it tho
[10:34:40] <JollyRgrs> A-KO: yeah, it doesn't handle it all... i think b/c of the window buffers, etc.
[10:34:47] <e1> win 10 start menu latency does my head in. and indexer failing at times
[10:34:56] <e1> It's always on somene elses system too so slows down resolution times
[10:35:01] <A-KO> e1: well, Windows 11 announced here soon :P

[20:35:17] <sd> 13<C​olour> That guy is prolly mostly stressed just from being a single dad and trying to work at the same time.
[20:35:19] <ArchLayperson> 2Tb NVMEs in RAID0 is addicting
[20:35:20] <Hunterkll> Much better plan than bringing $1k of ram, a spare X299 motherboard I have, a $2k CPU, $1k SSD,a nd $850 GPU as carryon luggage through a cross country flight

[20:36:36] <oxipital> then quit.
[20:37:13] <Hunterkll> The only thing I don't like about the G7 is that it runs hot (well, it's half the damn thickness with a more compact cooling system using damn-near desktop level components) and the lack of optical audio output
[20:37:20] <Hunterkll> had to use the USB DAC in my headset base instead of optical feed 
[20:37:56] <Hunterkll> got a similar loadout though, two 1TB SSDs & 32GB ram, only instead of two SATA 2.5" bays it's one 2.5 and one NVMe

[20:40:37] <Hunterkll> riff-IRC: you use an adapter like this to get the optical out - https://www.l-com.com/fiber-optic-toslink-female-to-mini-plug-male-adapter
[20:40:46] <Hunterkll> riff-IRC: not unless it's on/active or something usually 
[20:41:02] <riff-IRC> yea my laptop does NOT have optical
[20:41:09] <Hunterkll> sometimes there's a sensor that needs to be triggerd to turn it on

[20:41:54] <ArchLayperson> riff-IRC, some of them, many devices required the adapter to be inserted first. The easiest way to check is to see what devices show up in the OS.

[20:42:29] <ArchLayperson> amixer or pulse will see both outputs.
[20:42:33] <riff-IRC> so check the audio devices roster?
[20:42:35] <Hunterkll> yea
[20:42:38] <riff-IRC> ok
[20:42:49] <riff-IRC> so if it says digital out, it's got S/PDIF?

[20:43:01] <Hunterkll> yup

[20:43:09] <ArchLayperson> S/PDIF doesn'
[20:43:17] <ArchLayperson> t actually specify optical or coax, annoyingly.
[20:43:21] <riff-IRC> and if it's got an optical out in the audio hardware roster, then it's got optical?
[20:43:25] <ArchLayperson> However, if you hear TOSLink, that almost always means optical

[20:43:44] <riff-IRC> TOSLINK = Optical != S/PDIF
[20:44:24] <ArchLayperson> S/PDIF is signal-comptable with toslink, and manufacturers are really bad about labling optical S/PDIF as toslink and vice-versa. TOSlink is a toshiba name for it.

[20:44:54] * riff-IRC nods
[20:45:00] <riff-IRC> interesting
[20:45:00] <Hunterkll> looks like a normal non-optical one
[20:45:08] <ArchLayperson> riff-IRC, not always, some of them have a switch that the plug depresses, and don't do anything unless it is there.
[20:45:09] <Hunterkll> just an extra pin or two
[20:45:18] <riff-IRC> yea
[20:45:18] <Hunterkll> ArchLayperson: it'll still show up as an output device in the OS
[20:45:26] <ArchLayperson> Yep
[20:45:27] <Hunterkll> even if the transmitter isn't on 
[20:45:31] <Hunterkll> that's what we're talking about
[20:45:36] <ArchLayperson> Typically, yes.
[20:45:38] <riff-IRC> yea, I'll have to dig it up and check it
[20:45:48] <Hunterkll> we're not talking about if it's actually on or not :P
[20:45:57] <riff-IRC> BTW, I've got an SB Audigy II that I think has a bad RAMDAC.

[20:50:47] <Hunterkll> house is dusty as fuck so not surprising 
[20:50:50] <riff-IRC> that Audigy II ran in a system for the better part of 15 years nonstop
[20:51:13] <riff-IRC> Tried it in 2 different systems and it seems to be stone cold dead on the analog side
[20:52:38] <riff-IRC> Then again, it ran on a motherboard with bad capacitors and a sketchy PSU for who knows how long
[20:53:13] <riff-IRC> I got the system in 12/2018 because it went unstable and wouldn't run right
[20:53:29] <riff-IRC> SATA controller was flaky and later totally died, so I shut it off in the BIOS
[20:53:54] <riff-IRC> . o O {Come to think of it, I think it's internally bridged to IDE on the motherboard}
[20:55:16] <riff-IRC> That was probably a victim of $badPSU and $badcaps
[20:56:03] <riff-IRC> I've long since replaced the PSU (in fact, it's had 3 PSUs in it since 2018) and I got the mobo recapped early this year

[20:57:01] <riff-IRC> oh yes

[20:57:07] <Hunterkll> eh
[20:57:09] <Hunterkll> do it yourself

[20:57:21] <Hunterkll> did that to save a few MO drives

[20:58:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> yea
[20:58:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> a few caps are easy to replace
[20:58:46] <Hunterkll> then again, i almost essentially have a stocked electronics lab on hand, so
[20:58:46] <oxipital> does that include a desolder of the cap?
[20:58:59] <Hunterkll> well, yes, heat it up, tilt it to the side, heat the other one, pull it out, done
[20:59:00] <riff-IRC> regardless, it's been recapped and it's running again
[20:59:00] <oxipital> or are you jumpering them to the leads in place?
[20:59:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> oxipital with the right tools its easy as f. 
[20:59:11] <Hunterkll> replacing, not leaving faulty component in circuit
[20:59:12] <Hunterkll> that'd be retarded

[20:59:18] <Hunterkll> and alter capacitance values anyway of the new component
[20:59:23] <Hunterkll> which can cause even more fuckery
[20:59:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:59:33] <oxipital> nah cutting off the cap body, leaving the legs
[20:59:33] <riff-IRC> and the SATA controller likely got buttfucked by the sketchy PSU and bad caps combo
[20:59:47] <Hunterkll> oxipital: that's just nasty

[21:00:12] <riff-IRC> that system was probably not long from being totally run into the ground
[21:00:12] <Hunterkll> those leads wouldn't be long enough to be useful anyway
[21:00:14] <oxipital> i only ask because most boards are multilevel and i've always read soldering is bad/hard/whatever
[21:00:23] <Hunterkll> just be hot enough to do it quickly
[21:00:26] <Hunterkll> not really a big deal
[21:00:35] <riff-IRC> the only fan that still spun was the PSU and CPU fan and that was it
[21:00:42] <Hunterkll> the big problem is heat wicking away through the  board/etc,  hence being hot enough being important
[21:00:46] * oxipital shrugs. i also suck at soldering
[21:00:50] <Hunterkll> and once it's out

[22:39:44] <iphone> oxipital: you were cool for a while man
[22:39:45] <oxipital> but in terms of actually being different, carlina and texas are the only two types
[22:39:46] <killdash9> wrong. 
[22:40:14] <killdash9> you can't 'burn' things if smoked correctly. It's not possible. you can make it dry as all fuck though
[22:40:26] <sd> 05<v​yz> burnt ends = no burn haha
[22:40:57] <killdash9> they aren't actually burnt. They just got the most smoke
[22:41:21] <oxipital> they're charred according to wikiepdia
[22:41:29] <oxipital> which is a fine distinction
[22:41:31] <iphone> bbq sauce was planted by the CIA to make black southerners fat and diabetic in the 90s. That's why I get my pulled pork without sauce

[23:10:59] <sintax> fact^^

[23:11:12] <iphone> ;)
[23:11:20] <sintax> we've been wfh for a long long time and they're dragging everyone back on the 24th of this month. 
[23:11:25] <oxipital> to me, yeah
[23:11:40] <oxipital> i get that there's a difference of opinion on it

[23:12:01] <oxipital> but then you get posts like 'oh i'm beyond burned out' 
[23:12:01] <iphone> hakoDA: thanks. I've never seen 'exempt' in a job description and I'm just reading what it means and it sounds like a good excuse for an employer to over work you
[23:12:44] <sintax> iphone: it works both ways if they're a good employer. i'm exempt. but if i need to do something i just do it. i don't have to worry about pto because i've made it  up somewhere along the lines. 
[23:13:04] <sd> 13<X​orcisT> Hello, is it possible to get a remote Linux admin job without a degree?
[23:13:05] <oxipital> thats how it should be
[23:13:05] <hakoDA> assume we are talking about the same thing - meaning 'exempt' from overtime. its very common with IT fields, like in CA there are special rule for applying exempt status for IT people where other roles wouldn't qualify 
[23:13:29] <iphone> this would be in New England. Where they don't have bbq :(
[23:13:53] <sintax> if you don't have bbq you're screwed. 
[23:13:55] <oxipital> if i'm hourly i shouldnt be expected to be on call
[23:14:08] <oxipital> plenty of jobs do it though
[23:14:09] <sintax> XorcisT: you could get one without a degree if your experience is there. 
[23:14:19] <oxipital> same as time shifting
[23:14:20] <hakoDA> if you're hourly and oncall without getting paid thats straight wage theft 
[23:14:33] <sintax> yeah you have to be paid something if you're hourly and on call. 
[23:14:37] <oxipital> you have to do x at some fucked hour, don't get an opportunity to make it up later.
[23:14:38] <iphone> @XorcisT yes, I did it
[23:15:07] <oxipital> just now?
[23:15:29] <oxipital> werent you looking like last week?
[23:15:42] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Hourly on call here. We have to report 2 hours even if we answer the phone and do nothing.
[23:15:44] <iphone> I'm a linux admin without a degree, and looking to jump ship
[23:16:14] <hakoDA> the most common misclassified IT employee is help desk/support desk as *usually* this role doesn't qualify for exemption
[23:16:30] <oxipital> ^
[23:16:40] <hakoDA> but some HR/Mgmt are idiots and think all IT gets bumped into the classification
[23:16:56] <sintax> the one thing that bothers me with IT is that we don't have set titles. 
[23:16:56] <killdash9> they aren't idiots. It's intentional
[23:17:09] <oxipital> and many a user do not care about the distinction
[23:17:14] <sintax> sys admins are engineers etc...help desk, it analyst etc are all the same. 
[23:17:15] <hakoDA> well, yes thats true too haha
[23:17:34] <iphone> I'm an Infrastructure Engineer but really I just setup websites in AWS
[23:17:46] <hakoDA> they are idiots because thats an easy win for labor lawyers 
[23:17:49] <sintax> i've also seen jobs looking for a sys admin/dev/security/sql db admin all in one. 
[23:17:54] <iphone> and occasional programming
[23:17:55] <sintax> that's like 4 jobs depending on the size
[23:17:58] <CptLuxx> ah an it janitor
[23:18:02] <killdash9> just call me a sysadmin and I'm happy. The title inflation is stupidity
[23:18:19] <sintax> I'm a support engineer is my title but it's sysadmin work. 
[23:18:34] <oxipital> being an hourly sysadmin is am oxymoron
[23:18:55] <oxipital> but every job i've had/been offered - nonexempt sysadmin
[23:19:13] <sintax> weird. i like being exempt. it's easier for me to budget. 
[23:19:31] <oxipital> even though i'll be treated as exemptr
[23:19:36] <oxipital> i.e. on call
[23:19:45] <hakoDA> yeah and I'd never take a job where I had to clock in and out

[23:40:31] <oxipital> and its a sausage fest
[23:40:40] <jr> i've been on irc since 1997...kinda crazy thinking about that
[23:40:44] <oxipital> i hit these gents up and they get pissed
[23:40:48] <oxipital> yeah 1994.
[23:40:52] <PrincessZoey> My laptop has lasted 4 hours with 20% battery left :D 
[23:40:56] <oxipital> before that i used GEnie
[23:41:03] <oxipital> and got mad girls.
[23:41:11] <jr> 1994 we only had aol...didn't get a "real" ISP until 97
[23:41:12] <sd> 11<h​d> thoughts on wireless headsets? rn i’m looking at the poly voyager focus uc
[23:41:37] <jr> wireless headsets are almost as bad as printers....at least when it comes to microsoft teams
[23:41:51] <sintax> i've had luck with the jabra 75 uc
[23:42:04] <jr> i have a poly voyager 4200 uc on my desk and it's okay
[23:42:13] <killdash9> I use the Jabra 75s for meetings too. No issues
[23:42:36] <oxipital> jr, what networks were you on back then
[23:42:47] <jr> generally efnet and dalnet
[23:42:55] <sintax> newnet was where it was back then.
[23:43:09] <killdash9> channel wars on efnet in the mid-90s were epic
[23:43:16] <oxipital> word
[23:43:24] <oxipital> dalnet was shawty central
[23:43:35] <oxipital> and undernet hosted refined conversation
[23:43:36] <jr> yeah efnet was pretty much the crackhead infested ghetto of the internet
[23:43:42] <sintax> lol
[23:43:45] <jr> and yeah, dalnet had girls
[23:43:51] <sintax> like real girls?
[23:43:57] <oxipital> dalnet had some nice warez channels
[23:43:57] <jr> but efnet is also where you could find some cool shit
[23:43:58] <sintax> or guys pretending to be girls?
[23:44:09] <oxipital> yeah like talk on the phone girlds
[23:44:12] <killdash9> I helped run one of the biggest trading channels back then. Half the channel was bots just to maintain control of the channel in raids
[23:44:13] <sintax> dang.
[23:44:15] <jr> nah there were some real girls...i actually met one in person the one time
[23:44:25] <sintax> nice 
[23:44:26] <jr> and there were some phone convos
[23:44:30] <oxipital> efnet's warez and etc was too hard to get to
[23:44:30] <jr> strange times
[23:44:40] <oxipital> jr: i met a few
[23:44:43] <jr> yeah efnet you definitely needed connections
[23:44:46] <sintax> efnet is just private channels mostly now isn't it?
[23:44:48] <oxipital> i'm ugly, so lying on the internet.
[23:44:57] <PrincessZoey> I'm a girl, MikeSpears can confirm
[23:44:58] <sintax> haven't been there in a long time. 
[23:45:06] <jr> i'm still in a couple channels on efnet
[23:45:07] <sintax> MikeSpears: can you confirm?
[23:45:12] <jr> a couple that are still relatively active
[23:45:13] <oxipital> private, empty and foreigners
[23:45:16] <sintax> nice jr. 
[23:45:36] <sintax> i'm not on any networks anymore really. 
[23:45:42] <sintax> sad day
[23:45:49] <sintax> i'll have to go looking around again and see what i can get in to
[23:45:52] <killdash9> I disappeared for a few years after a couple people from the group got visits from men in suits. Time to lay low for a bit
[23:45:55] <jr> not quite what it used to be though...though servers are still getting ddos'd
[23:45:55] <oxipital> i used a different nick back then
[23:46:03] <oxipital> which group?
[23:46:37] <sintax> oh the memories though irc gives me. 
[23:46:49] <killdash9> $GROUPREMAINSUNNAMED
[23:47:01] <oxipital> i know, i miss some of the people i knew to this day
[23:47:07] <oxipital> :(  them feels
[23:47:09] <PrincessZoey> same oxipital 
[23:47:28] <jr> i was definitely involved in some shady stuff back then at times....but it was mostly just fun
[23:47:41] <jr> and i was a kid, and kids definitely think differently
[23:47:43] <PrincessZoey> I wonder where all the weirdos i hung out with as a teen are at now
[23:47:46] <oxipital> i hooked bsck up weith a girl i dated from undernet goth back in the day
[23:47:53] <killdash9> I still occasionally talk to people I met on FIBS in the very early 90s.
[23:48:10] <oxipital> she dumped me then because i was an introverted unemployed loser
[23:48:32] <jr> i still talk to one guy that met on irc back in the late 90s
[23:48:32] <oxipital> i helped her get back onm her feet this time, she basically ghosted me.
[23:48:41] <oxipital> still got them feels for her
[23:48:44] <jr> pretty good friends with him even though he lives a few hours away
[23:48:59] <jr> he's about the only one though....lost track of everyone else
[23:49:07] <oxipital> i had a homey on there who had md.
[23:49:18] <oxipital> no idea if he's dead or alive
[23:49:22] <sintax> there's a few i'll pop on and check in on if they're around. 
[23:49:30] <sintax> but been so long on other networks not really around anymore. 
[23:49:33] <sintax> do wonder where some went. 
[23:49:40] <oxipital> yeah
[23:50:23] <sintax> learned a lot. 
[23:50:30] <oxipital> yeah
[23:50:31] <MikeSpears> Yes
[23:50:31] <sintax> that's for sure. 
[23:50:43] <oxipital> guy i knew back then got pretty far up in cisco and shit
[23:50:45] <sintax> can't put it on a resume but learned a lot lol
[23:50:52] <oxipital> also got really fat.
[23:50:54] <jr> yeah i learned a shit ton from being on irc
[23:50:56] <sintax> haha
[23:51:03] <jr> did not get fat
[23:51:10] <oxipital> but he's done presentations at some pretty big conferences
[23:51:17] <sintax> i didn't either. until i made the change from management ops to IT
[23:51:27] <oxipital> just using irc back then was an education
[23:51:34] <sintax> eye opening too
[23:51:42] <jr> i remember there used to be a bunch of cisco routers on the internet that had the password and enable password in the hostname
[23:51:48] <jr> usually sprint's property
[23:51:52] <jr> that's my memory of cisco
[23:51:59] <sintax> heh. 
[23:52:04] <oxipital> getting a shell account, setting up ircii and bitchx 
[23:52:13] <sintax> ha bitchx. 
[23:52:33] <sintax> now to only bring irc back to the realm of popularity. 
[23:52:46] <jr> ircv3 will do that
[23:52:48] <jr> /s
[23:52:51] <sintax> heh
[23:52:59] <sintax> not until people can post pics directly to chat. 
[23:53:11] <jr> irccloud has kinda tried to do that haven't they
[23:53:18] <sintax> dunno
[23:53:26] <sintax> thelounge for irc is nice. i've used that. 
[23:53:30] <jr> i've never used it, but i see plenty of irccloud photo links on irc
[23:53:32] <oxipital> that and custom emoticons
[23:53:34] <sintax> but i also come back to mirc usually. 
[23:53:51] <sintax> just prefer irc over like discord because you can control your info
[23:53:57] <jr> yeah i've been an irssi person for the last 15 years or so
