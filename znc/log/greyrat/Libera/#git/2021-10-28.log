[01:05:31] <pflanze> What is the best way today to separate out the history for a subset of paths? I used to use git filter-branch, but that's really quite slow with large repositories.
[01:05:50] *** Quits: aniruddha (uid340443@id-340443.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:05:52] <pflanze> I.e. I want to remove all history not touching a set of paths that I provide.
[01:06:42] <imMute> git subtree split ...    might be useful.  that last bit "remove everything except the specified paths" sounds like a job for filter-branch though (or the new one, I forget what it's called)

[01:06:59] *** Joins: ZacSharp (~ZacSharp@user/zacsharp)
[01:07:01] <imMute> any tool that  rewrites the complete history is probably going to be just as slow as filter-branch though.
[01:07:46] <pflanze> The reason I expect it to be fast is that if I give it 2 paths, that only have 5 commits in the history, copying those commits should be very fast.
[01:08:14] <pflanze> filter-branch is slow because it also checks out every other commit, as a working dir, to let me remove.
[01:08:28] <ChemicalRascal> That's not quite right, filter-branch has issues with it not because it's rewriting all of history, but because the fundamental algorithm it uses is superlinear, the computational complexity makes it painful.
[01:08:39] <pflanze> Essentially I want to copy what I want to keep, not copy everything and remove what I don't want.
[01:09:28] <osse> if you can formulate an index-filter instead of tree-filter it's much faster
[01:09:53] <pflanze> ChemicalRascal, I think filter-branch is O(numcommits * numfiles). I guess that's what you mean by superlinear, right.
[01:10:25] <ChemicalRascal> pflanze, nope, it's worse than that, have a look at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch#PERFORMANCE
[01:10:58] <ChemicalRascal> Or maybe that is O(c*f) actually
[01:11:16] <ChemicalRascal> (either way that's terribad)
[01:11:38] <pflanze> Yep
[01:11:58] <ChemicalRascal> https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/ might achieve what you want, that's broadly what the docs recommend at the moment

[03:38:37] <elibrokeit> pflanze: I achieved what you want a long time ago, by grabbing formatted patches for each commit that touched the paths according to git log and then sed'ing out the patch file to rewrite the destination filenames and strip leading subdirs. Then just git am *.patch
[03:38:38] <elibrokeit> :D
[03:39:08] <pflanze> I don't need to change the paths.
[03:39:19] <elibrokeit> oh, even easier...

[03:51:18] <pflanze> (Although, can't actually use cherry-pick when commits have also modifications to files I don't want. And cherry-pick doesn't seem to have a feature to do such filtering.)
[03:51:36] <pflanze> s/have also/also have/
[03:51:53] <elibrokeit> IIRC the patches I used at the time, were generated by cgit which does have such a feature.
[03:52:22] <pflanze> I'll try filter-repo when I get to it.
[03:53:02] <elibrokeit> well, I guess there is always conflict resolution... but filter-repo to just recreate the entire repo with every other path deleted, seems like the simplest solution

[07:57:58] <gajus> how do I get second commit from the top in `git log` output?
[07:59:01] <gajus> git log gives:
[07:59:03] <gajus> 04397cb26 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge pull request #456 from contrawork/gajus/simplify-production-build
[07:59:03] <gajus> 0c5829cf9 Merge branch 'master' into gajus/simplify-production-build
[07:59:09] <gajus> and I just need 0c5829cf9
[07:59:50] <elibrokeit> gajus: git log HEAD^ or master^
[08:00:16] <elibrokeit> `git log` is functionally an implied `git log HEAD`
[08:00:49] <gajus> git log HEAD^ does not even mention that commit
[08:01:14] <gajus> neither does master^
[08:03:01] <gajus> really confused ...
[08:03:11] <elibrokeit> Is it just giving you the wrong side of the merge ancestor?
[08:03:33] <gajus> Probably? I don't fully understand what's going on here.
[08:05:08] <gajus> based on the fact that `git log --first-parent` does not even show my commit, I assume yes
[08:05:30] <elibrokeit> try HEAD^2
[08:06:27] <elibrokeit> also see man gitrevisions
[08:06:27] <gitinfo> the gitrevisions manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/gitrevisions.html
[08:07:42] <gajus> yeah, git log --pretty=format:%H HEAD^2 -1 gives what I am after
[08:08:00] <gajus> will need to dig deeper to understand what's going on here though
[08:08:04] <gajus> thanks elibrokeit
[08:08:30] <elibrokeit> the gitrevisions page explains a bit more
[08:08:54] <elibrokeit> basically HEAD is an alias to a sha1, so is master -- they point to the same one in fact ;)

[08:09:15] <elibrokeit> add a ^ and it gets the ^1 parent of the commit, which is... the wrong side of the merge

[14:48:10] <famubu> Thanks a lot.
[14:48:27] <osse> can you reproduce it?
[14:48:41] <famubu> osse: I'll try.
[14:49:09] <famubu> I had done it twice and in both cases it was in the same condition. I'll check once more to be sure.
[14:49:29] <osse> it'll look like you deleted everything if e.g. the index is missing.
[14:49:49] <osse> so my guess is that some files couldn't be written to disk at clone-time
[14:51:52] <famubu> 2 of the submodules couldn't be cloned due to permission problems. git had said gave it another try and left it there (sorry forgot to mention that earlier). Maybe that meant the cloning hadn't finished properly? I thought it would just leave the submodules that couldn't be obtained and be happy with what it could get...

[16:47:11] <elibrokeit> OnkelTem: the leading "v" is also treated specially by GitHub, gitlab, and cgit at least -- all 3 will remove a "v" from the beginning of a tag name, when creating the autogenerated archive tarballs. This is not universal... Other software forges may not do so (at least one I know for a fact doesn't)

[18:36:48] <elibrokeit> Anyway the trick is generally to contribute to popular and low-level stuff, and hope that one of them ends up integrated into something GitHub is badging about. In my case, I have once contributed to the curl software.
[18:37:36] <elibrokeit> I suppose it's too much to hope for them to have used the pacman package manager in there.

[23:51:09] <flmbray> hi all... git merge question.  i'm fairly new to git so apologies if some of what I say seems novice.  my question has to do with the GitGraph output shown here: https://pasteboard.co/WFv9AYI16xtR.png, and why the merge (green arrow) looks like a regular commit (just a dot on the path), instead of an actual merge (a curved line joining two paths).  The history goes like this: (1) I created the features/59108-klarity branch
[23:51:09] <flmbray> from the MP2021.10.26 branch.  There were many other changes to the MP2021.10.26 branch, and at one point I had to reverse-pull into my branch to resolve some conflicts (the red arrow).  However I also had some issues with npm where the package-lock.json file was had some incorrect changes, so I needed to revert that file.  I did that by using "git checkout <commitHash> <fileSpec>", which then showed in my staged files, and I
[23:51:10] <flmbray> pushed another commit, and the Pull Request (which had already been created previously) was then Approved and completed.  I think the branch was also marked to be deleted.  However I do know that the changes in that PR were merged - I see them when I look at the files in the MP2021.10.26 branch, and of course, the commit with the green arrow is that merge.  Maybe this is no big deal and I can just leave it like it is, but it
[23:51:15] <flmbray> bothers me that this open-circle node (what does that indicate??) is just going to sit out there forever.  With the information provided, is there an explanation of what happened?  Is there an easy way to fix this (to make it appear as if the branch was actually merged)?
[23:55:06] <imMute> I didn't read the whole story, but the "Merged PR" commit message sounds like youre using something like github.  One of the common PR completion options is "squash + fast-foward" - in that mode your branch would get squashed down to a single commit and then that commit is made on the target branch directly.  The result would look like what the green arrow is pointing at.
[23:55:37] <imMute> I think that option is the worst of all of them since it makes a new commit that regular git tools have no way of knowing is related to the source branch, so I avoid doing it as much as I can.

[23:57:12] <flmbray> this is using ADO on a local server.  As far as I'm aware, we didn't do anything differently with the PR itself (except the weirdness with the package-lock.json file getting reverted.)
[23:58:54] <flmbray> in any case, from your description, I don't think we are using squash+ff
[23:59:21] <imMute> It's been a while since I used ADO, but if you go to the PR page for that PR, I think it tells you how the merge was done.
