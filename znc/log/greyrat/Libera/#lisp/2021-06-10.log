[11:59:30] <Guest63> Hi - I have a stupid question. I can do '#I(...) to return the output from the reader macro #I
[12:00:09] <Guest63> Here ... = a literal string. How would I do the same with a string stored in a variable? e.g. '#I(my-string) --> I don't want to evaluate the form, just gets its transformed version
[12:00:47] *** Quits: cchristi` (~user@n122-106-221-66.sbr1.nsw.optusnet.com.au) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:01:08] <prxq_> The reader macro is a function. You can get it from somewhere iirc. And then you can call it however way you want.
[12:02:34] <Guest63> Thanks, let me have a look
[12:02:53] *** Quits: cjb (~cjb@user/cjb) ()
[12:02:55] <Guest63> I just tried `#I(,my-string) but it gave am error
[12:03:52] <White_Flame> clhs get-dispatch-macro-character
[12:04:00] <White_Flame> !clhs get-dispatch-macro-character
[12:04:14] <White_Flame> hmm, but in any case, the reader macro function takes a stream, so you'll have to wrap that, too
[12:04:15] <prxq_> Guest63: you can put it in a string and send it through read.
[12:04:42] <White_Flame> and yes, read-from-string is the next suggestion, and probably shorter in code/complexity
[12:05:11] <moon-child> read-from-string feels icky
[12:05:13] <moon-child> like eval lite
[12:05:30] *** Joins: cjb (~cjb@user/cjb)
[12:09:38] <Guest63> Thanks guys
[12:10:13] <Guest63> So I am able to run it, but it is evaluating: '(cmu-infix::read-infix (read-from-string test))
[12:10:14] <White_Flame> hmm, just calling the function from the readtable errors out on me, with SB-IMPL::*READ-BUFFER* unbound, so there's probably more context involved than just calling that function
[12:10:31] <White_Flame> this is in testing calling the #S reader macro directly

[12:11:01] <Guest63> And when I quote it (like in the above), it quotes the whole form - basically I want the output of the reader macro to be quoted
[12:11:31] <White_Flame> put the quote as the first character of your string then
[12:12:08] <White_Flame> hmm, no, that's not it either
[12:12:10] <Guest63> (CMU-INFIX::READ-INFIX (READ-FROM-STRING TEST))
[12:12:13] <Guest63> Is what I get
[12:12:37] <Guest63> Yeah - that won't work. I want the string to be evaluated, the reader macro to return the form but the form not to be evaluated
[12:13:15] <White_Flame> wait, I think you're swapping steps
[12:13:28] <White_Flame> during read, the reader macros execute and return more literal forms
[12:13:45] <White_Flame> but there is no evaluation of the form yet
[12:13:57] <White_Flame> unless you specifically call EVAL or something
[12:14:09] <prxq_> Guest63: it's probably cleaner to hack CMU-INFIX.
[12:14:33] <White_Flame> so for "the string to be evaluated", that'd be read + eval

[18:48:49] <pjb> em: but the AIM-8 fundamental LISP memo defines lisp with an eval function (written in M-expressions, of course, since it's code), that takes a _representation_ of a lisp program as data, S-expression, and interprets it.  So the if above, can be written as lisp data S-expr: (IF (= A B) (PRINT (QUOTE EQUAL)) (PRINT (QUOTE (A B)) A B)) and this data can be passed to the eval function: eval[(IF (= A B) (PRINT (QUOTE EQUAL)) (PRINT (QUOTE

[18:50:18] <pjb> em: and suddently everybody was writting lisp data, and having it EXECUTED!

[18:51:44] <pjb> em: actually for quote some few years (AFAIK until macros were invented), people still wrote lisp papers, user manuals and documentation using M-expressions to write lisp code.  S-expressions were only used in punched cards!
