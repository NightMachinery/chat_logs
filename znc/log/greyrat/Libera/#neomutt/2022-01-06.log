[05:14:14] <flatcap> Here's a heavily nested example: https://gist.github.com/flatcap/4eccda58af3adc022b967f94d11e3d01
[05:15:29] <flatcap> I've created 26 files named A-Z and the log output looks like
[05:15:35] <flatcap> <0,A,&<&<&<B,D>,C>,&<G,H,I>>,E,F>
[05:16:31] <flatcap> '0' for the fundamental part, [A-Z] for the files and '&' for a grouping

[14:21:54] <flatcap> morning all
[14:24:49] <dcpurton> morning!
[14:27:14] <flatcap> dcpurton: yeah, it needs some more thought
[14:27:34] <flatcap> but it's got potential
[14:28:16] <flatcap> for the windows, I put in more details
[14:28:21] <flatcap> <FIX {0x,0y} [174C,43R]<MAX {0x,0y} [174C,42R]<MAX {0x,0y} [174C,42R]<FIX {0x,0y} [20C,42R]><MAX {20x,0y} [154C,42R]<MAX {20x,0y} [154C,42R]<MAX {20x,0y} [154C,41R]><FIX {20x,41y} [154C,1R]>>>>><FIX {0x,42y} [174C,1R]>>
[14:28:38] <dcpurton> Yep, I think it's a good option. Easy (if time consuming) to create automated tests. 
[14:28:52] <flatcap> position, size, type, etc
[14:29:39] <flatcap> and some tests should create errors, which are also logged
[14:30:09] <dcpurton> I uploaded a possible way to run tests to your test repository.
[14:30:26] * flatcap looks ...
[14:30:32] <dcpurton> I see, you could test that the display is right
[14:32:40] <flatcap> yeah
[14:33:33] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[14:33:52] <flatcap> I also wondered about a function (this is very speculative, I've no idea how/if it would work), that would take "<a,b,c>" and turn it into Bodies
[14:34:09] <flatcap> to create starting places for tests
[14:34:52] <flatcap> yes, your tests/ dir is exactly what I had in mind
[14:36:07] <dcpurton> Except I put a bit too much in `attach-one` by accident. Just moved the tagging and grouping to the actual test file
[14:36:17] <flatcap> ok
[14:36:40] <dcpurton> the trouble remains that there are so many combinations
[14:36:54] <flatcap> true, but we don't need to test every one...
[14:37:23] <flatcap> we'll do our best and have a framework to easily describe any potential test and its results
[14:37:36] <dcpurton> I guess. Part of it can just be useful as a work in progress to test for regressions
[14:37:43] <flatcap> exactly
[14:38:35] <flatcap> if we can automate the process, then I can create a github action to run whenever
[14:38:48] * flatcap likes github actions :-)
[14:39:34] <dcpurton> I'll leave that to you. I'm barely capable of rebasing
[14:39:47] <flatcap> :-)
[14:40:30] <dcpurton> BTW
[14:40:47] <dcpurton> with the test files, I seemed to have to put all the commands in a single `push`
[14:40:56] <dcpurton> is that expected?
[14:41:12] <dcpurton> I thought maybe I could have several push lines
[14:41:38] <dcpurton> and it would behave the same as one push line
[14:41:52] <flatcap> a single push is fine, but there's a trickiness with multiple pushes
[14:42:12] <flatcap> each pushes to the front of the queue, so you need to list them back-to-front
[14:42:38] <dcpurton> ooo
[14:42:44] <dcpurton> that I did not see
[14:42:45] <flatcap> push 'c'; push 'b'; push 'a' to expect 'abc'
[14:42:54] <flatcap> don't ask me why :-)
[14:44:55] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:49:42] <dcpurton> Oh, an unrelated question: When piping an attachment to a command, is it possible to pass the email subject to the command as an argument?
[14:50:33] <dcpurton> e.g., something like: `| mycmd %s` and have %s expand to the subject
[14:51:01] <flatcap> I don't think so, but it'd be easy enough to add (and useful)
[14:51:04] * flatcap looks ...
[14:54:49] <flatcap> no.  mutt_pipe_message() asks for the command.  we could use mutt_make_string() to allow expandos "%s", etc
[14:57:11] <flatcap> ah!  there's a precedent, the hook command
[14:58:37] <flatcap> addr_hook() expands the hook->command using a mailbox and email
[15:00:33] <flatcap> save-hook https://neomutt.org/guide/configuration#save-hook

[21:19:48] * flatcap hopes not :-)
[21:21:28] <bookworm> notmuch behaves differently when you give it NULL vs ""
[21:21:40] <adray> i have a use case that seems cleaner if i could. it's opening the notmuch db, we pass a config_path parameter. NULL causes libnotmuch to auto look for a config, empty string doesn't load a config, and an actual value specifies a config file
[21:23:22] <bremner> yeah, sorry about the NULL vs. "" thing. I couldn't think of a better way to have two out-of-band values
[21:23:32] <bremner> more parameters I guess
[21:23:56] <flatcap> hmm... I can't think of a quick way to cheat.  mutt stored "" as NULL, so my config replacement did the same
[21:24:46] <adray> A hacky solution would be to add DT_ALLOW_EMPTY and don't NULL the empty for that type
[21:25:12] <adray> not sure how that'd propagate through the rest of the code though
[21:26:02] <flatcap> hmm... as all the config setting/getting has to happen through functions, that probably wouldn't affect anyone
[21:27:03] <flatcap> I'm wondering if we could store something in NmAccountData, but that probably wouldn't exist yet
[21:28:10] <flatcap> or perhaps a validator on the config item that sets a bool, that might work
[21:28:50] <adray> bremner: i put the blame on C's type system over you. harder to express some ideas with it
[21:29:29] <bremner> adray: yeah, it's definitely something I notice switching between C and other languages.
[21:33:33] <adray> flatcap: correct me if i'm not following this correctly, you're proposing that we put validator on this new value (call it nm_config_path) so that when nm_config_path="", it'll set another boolean variable and we can check that to determine if we should pass NULL or "" to the notmuch function?
[21:33:36] <flatcap> both string_set() and string_reset() call the validator, so the bool idea would work if the user later `:reset nm_path`
[21:33:59] <flatcap> yes
[21:35:14] <flatcap> you'd be able to tell if the user had set the var, without having to rewrite the config system
[21:36:00] <flatcap> a better solution (more work), would be to add a new DT_HAS_BEEN_SET flag to config/types.h
[21:36:22] <adray> okay, that could work. though it would leak internals to a user if they go looking. is the validator called before set() code?
[21:36:24] <flatcap> then tweak each of the config types for set/reset
[21:36:40] <flatcap> yes, before _set() and _reset()
[21:38:41] <flatcap> if this is a one-off, then it's self-container (to the notmuch backend)
[21:39:10] <flatcap> if we find some more needs, then I'll explore the flag solution
[21:39:19] <flatcap> (I might explore it anyway)
[21:39:33] <adray> okay, i'll go with the bool approach for now until there's more use-cases
[21:42:24] <flatcap> cool

[22:02:55] <bsd4me> I am running Windows right now out of necessity and am not all that familiar with it. Can neomutt run on windows 10?
[22:04:09] <bremner> bsd4me: do you have WSL?
[22:04:28] <bsd4me> Sorry, what is that? WSL
[22:04:32] <bremner> also not a windows guy, but I thought W10 came with a fake linux subsystem
[22:05:34] <bsd4me> I did see something about linux on the machine, but didn't know what it was so was hesitant to do anything with it. lol, don't even remember where I saw it.
