[03:02:36] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> Old game
[03:02:45] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> But it’s nice
[03:02:49] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, I dont care about whether its new or not lol
[03:03:27] <Cl0udNinja> I just wanted something that wasnt an FPS or I could more or less idle play, while still being interesting enough to get sucked into
[03:12:44] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: why did you buy it?
[03:12:47] <JollyRgrs> it is free on epic games right now
[03:13:09] <CptLuxx> yeah but then he has to use epic games
[03:13:13] <CptLuxx> better buy it
[03:13:27] <JollyRgrs> you can still import steam workshop mods to the epic version
[03:13:59] <CptLuxx> you still have to use the epic launcher :p
[03:14:25] <JollyRgrs> not sure if you do or not
[03:14:32] <JollyRgrs> could potentially just launch the .exe? iunno

[03:15:56] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, I hate 'free' weekend shits like that for any game, but I also didnt know that, because I dont use the epic games launcher. anyway i dont really care that much. rather give devs money for the base game at the very least
[03:16:12] <JollyRgrs> not free weekend, free 4 life
[03:16:21] <JollyRgrs> this is EA, right?
[03:17:11] <Cl0udNinja> no, paragon or something
[03:17:16] <Cl0udNinja> idk if they're owned by EA
[03:17:22] <JollyRgrs> oh yeah, that's right... the EA one was a diff one
[03:17:40] <CptLuxx> sim city
[03:17:49] <JollyRgrs> yeah, but the newer one, i forget the title of it
[03:17:52] <JollyRgrs> they were out around the same time
[03:18:15] <JollyRgrs> CptLuxx: iirc, i thought epic payed $ for their "free game" giveaways
[03:18:33] <CptLuxx> i prefer to pay

[03:20:05] <CptLuxx> uh its possible
[03:20:09] <CptLuxx> i only  have steam
[03:20:18] <CptLuxx> its not on steam? hello piracy
[03:20:53] <JollyRgrs> you know what I mean
[03:21:14] <JollyRgrs> and that works fine for single player games. MP games are not always as easy to pirate unless you only ever play with other pirate-y peoples
[03:21:21] <CptLuxx> right
[03:22:40] <JollyRgrs> lol, don't know if i saw this earlier or not (prob did and forgot) but with the apple lawsuit, it was revealed how much epic made off of fortnite in the first 2 years... $9B https://hypebeast.com/2021/5/fortnite-new-financial-details-revealed-9-billion-usd-revenue-announcement
[03:22:51] <CptLuxx> rofl
[03:23:05] <CptLuxx> insane
[03:23:14] <technonerd> Hence all the fuck you money purchases 
[03:23:41] <JollyRgrs> yup
[03:24:06] <JollyRgrs> i mean, fortnite couldn't have been that much $ to make compared to CoD or something, it is fairly simple in gfx and in mechanics, etc.
[03:24:18] <JollyRgrs> and it made B.A.N.K.
[03:27:18] <technonerd> This is after he rage quit PC games cuz piracy and went back to console Dev 
[03:39:33] <sd_> 08<G​ene> advertising probably ate the largest chunk of their revenue honestly

[04:17:21] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> the only thing apple might have issues with is large stores like Amazon not being allowed to sell ebooks in the app because apple sells ebooks
[04:18:37] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> IIRC fortnight Flagrently broke the app store TOS and got terminated for it
[04:18:54] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> they hid a private payment system for microtransactions in the game
[04:19:10] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> Right

[04:20:12] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> It wasn’t hidden it was just separate to the App Store
[04:20:37] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> if had to have been hidden to pass app review
[04:20:50] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> they point is
[04:20:53] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> they broke the rules

[04:21:04] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> But they knew of it

[04:21:40] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> It wasn’t hidden lol

[04:22:11] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> until it shows up in court we don't know if it was hidden upon app review

[04:23:19] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> I've personally hidden stuff that's not allowed from app review
[04:24:47] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> apple is 100% going to check microtransactions use their API
[04:24:52] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> and if they don't reject it
[04:25:30] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> you can encrypt it so while its in apple testing it uses their APIs then when published uses their own
[04:25:50] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> and even make it look similar (boy, Apple would slaughter them for that)
[04:26:20] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> If u think an app like Fortnite doing micro transactions was “hidden” from Apple that’s funny to me.
[04:26:26] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> no
[04:26:29] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> I'm saying
[04:26:49] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> fortnight doing microtransactions using their own payment processor was hidden during app assessment
[04:26:50] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> They knew it wasn’t through their transaction api from the get go
[04:27:15] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> I'm going to stop and just say [Citation Needed]
[04:27:20] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> But it was also an app that was wildly popular
[04:27:46] <sd_> 06<N​injaStyle> So they sent dear and desist shit instead trying to get them to follow tos

[13:48:21] <nobyk> If it's 100% possible, you just have to find it online
[13:48:32] <nobyk> forums, documentation or whatever
[13:50:09] <nobyk> The knowledge of what is possible and the skillset to figure out how to do it. I think that's a good feature to have as an IT guy/gal

[13:57:18] <BWMerlin> por qué no ambos
[13:59:13] <nobyk> PrincessZoey: well I'm gonna start with the former and we'll see about the latter
[14:06:21] <Kiernian|Work> as my grandmother would often say when we were trying to decide between two things "Why not both?"
[14:06:34] <Kiernian|Work> although she was usually referring to us kids deciding on which kind of dessert we wanted

[14:07:24] <nobyk> OR
[14:07:44] <nobyk> ring scorching diarrhea
[14:07:50] <nobyk> hmm tough choice
[14:08:54] <Kiernian|Work> holy crap, a forbes article about how returning to the office is bad, counter-productive, and obsolete. Who kidnapped the middle-management shills and replaced them with people possessing technical knowledge about things invented decades ago?
[14:10:30] <Kiernian|Work> although I love their use of the phrase "Zoom Gloom" talking about "the drain too many are feeling after a day of staring at faces in boxes"...no, that's just what we all look like when people call too many unnecessary meetings that should be e-mails.
[14:11:35] <PrincessZoey> Kiernian|Work you mean like my last job where I had 3 half hour meetings for a 4 hour shift?

[14:12:36] <Kiernian|Work> Yes, probably. Any time a meeting is called for anything less than an identified problem that requires a meeting to solve, it's probably not a good idea to have said meeting.

[14:17:13] <Kiernian|Work> yeah, the second management job I had sure was cushy because I was required to sit in LOTS of generally ridiculously long meetings in order to assemble about 5 to 10 minutes of actual actionable or necessary information so the lack of stress was nice, but holy crap did I miss the sense of accomplishment from actually DOING stuff
[14:17:25] <nobyk> idk with my current job I prefer the office
[14:18:10] <Kiernian|Work> and that's cool. There's also a place for office work. For some roles or work types it can actually be superior. Just not always and for everything.
[14:18:49] <Kiernian|Work> I don't think "open floor plan" is likely ever good, though. I've never seen an implementation that could be counted as an improvement in any way at least

[23:54:42] <monr0e> I, too, would like to have my very own hellcat destroyer
[23:54:42] <yuken> including fingerprints, face pic, then it takes up to 12 months to be approved. or told "you filled this in wrong and while we know what you meant, you must resubmit".
[23:54:58] <Kiernian> yup
[23:55:47] <yuken> They only recently started doing it online, Kiernian, despite it being required since the 1930s.
[23:55:59] <yuken> And only super recently began donig the fingerprints online/digitally too.
[23:56:17] <yuken> So even before, the first time you did it, or if you hadn't done it in 2+ years, you gotta send fingerprints in via mail.
[23:56:19] <Kiernian> yeah, I was actually surprised when you said they're fine with digital images
[23:56:20] <yuken> And you better fuckin hope they arrive.
