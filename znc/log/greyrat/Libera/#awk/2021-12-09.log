[02:19:20] <e36freak> tag: aoc
[02:19:52] <e36freak> https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8
[02:20:19] <e36freak> still relatively easy, they get fun by the end
[02:22:26] <seninha> I simplified my solution: https://github.com/phillbush/aoc/blob/master/2021/day08b
[02:22:56] <seninha> I build a translation array at the left part of the input and use it on the right part
[02:24:17] <e36freak> mine with a faster subtract, cuts the time in half: http://ix.io/3HqX
[02:25:24] <e36freak> oh damn yours is quick
[02:25:37] <earnest> lookup tables everywhere
[02:25:42] <e36freak> i'm POSIX though :)
[02:26:04] <earnest> What is 'compl' and 'or' from?  Does gawk actually provide that
[02:26:08] <e36freak> yes
[02:26:14] <earnest> til, lol
[02:26:34] <earnest> I would never have even thought to look
[02:26:43] <e36freak> my bitmath skills are weaksauce though, gotta figure out how this works
[02:26:48] <seninha> Yeah, mine is not POSIXly. I use bitwise operations
[02:27:18] <e36freak> oh mine's not far off, 0.020s vs 0.016 for yours on my machine
[02:27:28] <e36freak> when i have time i'll figure out how yours works :)
[02:27:48] <e36freak> OH i see what it does already, nice
[02:27:57] <earnest> LUT all the things
[02:28:06] <earnest> Also special case the common
[02:28:15] <e36freak> nested ternary operators though, gross
[02:28:20] <earnest> I mean, two laws of performance: 1) Don't do it, 2) Do it quickly
[02:28:43] <seninha> e36freak: heh,
[02:28:49] <earnest> Yes, true.  Fast code doesn't have to be esoteric
[02:28:51] <seninha> I might replace them with some if-elses
[02:28:56] <earnest> Yus
[02:29:29] <seninha> Have you tried tk's big input? https://the-tk.com/project/aoc2021-bigboys.html
[02:30:11] <seninha> mine takes 27.7 seconds on that big input
[02:30:18] <seninha> (but my machine is old and my awk implementation (OpenBSD) is not as fast as GNU's)
[02:31:10] <tag> wow, this website is impossible to read
[02:31:31] <e36freak> fucking lol i'm an idiot, download it and trying to figure out where it is

[02:32:50] <geirha> hum. My bash version takes .038s on the regular and 13.4s on that big input

[02:36:07] <e36freak> geirha: i like your default to test input method
[02:36:43] <geirha> I stole the idea from someone else. I think it was izabera
[02:36:57] <e36freak> geirha: oh that's clever
[02:37:04] <e36freak> on the pattern matching method
[02:37:06] <e36freak> haven't seen that yet
[02:37:55] <seninha> Didn't know about -t, had to check test(1)
[02:38:05] <e36freak> i bet that would be blazing if you did it in awk
[02:40:52] <seninha> nice, geirha is using the same logic of checking 2/3/5 and 0/6/9 with 4 and 1

[03:04:44] <e36freak> slower.
[03:05:14] <seninha> yeah, substr is faster tan (g)sub
[03:05:37] <e36freak> yeah but i thought ~5 substrs with 2 loops might be slower than 1 gsub
[03:05:40] <e36freak> it is not
[03:06:07] <e36freak> makes sense given how easy it is to implement substr() in C

[03:07:49] <tag> the go compiler blows my mind by how shitty it is
[03:07:52] <e36freak> lol
[03:13:11] <seninha> tag: nice language, shitty tooling
[03:13:48] <tag> The programming language is quaint and powerful, and you can conveniently push the runtime out of your way if you need it and the runtime is fairly fit for a large number of general use cases
[03:13:56] <tag> But the compiler...is a joke.
[03:14:18] <tag> Which is why so much of the standard library is implemented in hand-written assembler

[04:10:52] <TenochSLB> Hi, is there a way to find a match and then print the nth previous line based on the NR of the line match?
[04:11:53] <seninha> The easiest way is to save the lines in an array.
[04:11:55] <TenochSLB> similar to /pattern/{ z=NR+1} z==NR {print} to print the second line after a match

[22:49:28] <mawk> hi
[22:49:37] <mawk> is there a way to do like 20*' ' in python but in awk?
[22:49:41] <mawk> to align text
[22:50:59] <mawk> using a loop I guess
[22:51:07] <nmz1> printf ?
[22:51:13] <seninha> # awk 'BEGIN { printf ":%" 20 "s:", " " }'
[22:51:14] <emanuele6> printf("%*s", 20, " ")
[22:51:15] <shbot> seninha: :                    :
[22:51:56] <mawk> ah nice
[22:51:57] <mawk> thanks
[22:52:23] <emanuele6> printf("%*s", 20, " ") is not POSIX i don't think, but since your name is mawk i figured that is not an issue
[22:52:38] <mawk> lol
[22:52:41] <mawk> yeah
[22:52:55] <emanuele6> if not, you can inject a number into the format as seninha showed, but i wouldn't reccomend it
[22:53:07] <emanuele6> s/reccomend/recommend/
[22:55:07] <emanuele6> actually, it is "%*s" is valid and specified in POSIX awk  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/awk.html
[22:55:23] <emanuele6> so there is no reason to inject a number into the format 
[22:55:45] <emanuele6> i thought it was not since "%*s" is not specified for printf(1)
[22:57:00] <emanuele6> s/it is "%\*s"/"%*s"/
[22:57:31] <seninha> weird
[22:57:34] <seninha> my awk(1) says to check printf(1) for format string descriptors
[22:58:12] <emanuele6> my `man 1 awk' says to check `man 3 fprintf'
[22:58:34] <emanuele6> and "%*s" is defined in C99 (that is the C standard that POSIX follows)
[22:58:55] <seninha> https://man.openbsd.org/awk.1#sprintf
[22:59:20] <seninha> (but my printf(1) says that * as width is supported, so that's not a problem)
[23:00:17] <emanuele6> yeah, good to know that "%*s" is actually defined in POSIX awk though, I thought it was not like for the POSIX `printf' utility
[23:00:36] <mawk> the one in sh you mean?
[23:00:48] <mawk> that one seems to follow printf(3) as well

[23:01:24] <emanuele6> mawk: POSIX does not enforce whether printf should be an external program or a shell builtin, but yes that one
[23:01:39] <emanuele6> POSIX explicitly says that * is not specified iirc
[23:02:02] <emanuele6> No provision is made in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 which allows field widths and precisions to be specified as '*' since the '*' can be replaced directly in the format operand using shell variable substitution. Implementations can also provide this feature as an extension if they so choose.
[23:02:14] <emanuele6> https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/printf.html
[23:02:26] <earnestly> printf(1p) is defined differently to printf(3)
[23:02:42] <earnestly> And doesn't just say the format will be like printf(3), like some do with strftime(3)
