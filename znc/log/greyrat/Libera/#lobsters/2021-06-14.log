[04:27:24] <ch0de> then charge for remaining on leenode similar to IRCCloud's pricing plan.

[04:31:29] <Teckla> I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but...
[04:31:53] <ch0de> everybody's learning a very hard lesson that some individuals do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. in fact most don't, unless proven otherwise.
[04:31:57] <technomancy`> so there was one forth channel that stayed on freenode, and then the fsf said they'd consider it but decided against... is there anyone else staying?
[04:32:08] <ch0de> technomancy`: iirc the forth channel is even at its wits end.

[04:53:39] <Teckla> Kind of wimpy... but hey, cheap!  ($10/mo)
[04:53:45] <chronos> Also, makes sense it uses more resources, they have both the old and new world generation systems in it

[17:59:00] <hoistbypetard> it just occurred to me... maybe Lee was honest when he said his goal was to make IRC less centralized. by running off all the non-troll users and causing a new network to be created by those ops who cared about the community, IRC is now measurably less centralized than it was before he started his antics

[22:17:08] <riv> manicennui, i am so curious! who is on there and why?!
[22:17:16] <ramonconacento> For what it's worth, the whole Freenode debacle is what enticed me to have a look at the IRC community, after 15 or so years being away.
[22:20:43] <jj5> I tried with regex in PHP but still 114 chars. *sigh* :)
[22:21:35] <jj5> <?php while($l=fgets(STDIN)){echo(preg_match('/^( +)(.*)/',$l,$m)?str_repeat("\t",strlen($m[1])).$m[2]."\n":$l);}
[22:21:40] <technomancy`> ramonconacento: it seems to have had a weirdly strengthening effect on many communities
[22:21:47] <ngoldbaum> can someone code golf it in C pls
[22:22:31] <riv> ii cant even fiure out what any of these scripts do
[22:25:43] <manicennui> Other than the command line arguments being a big magical, the Perl version is ironically the easiest to understand.
[22:26:15] <Ticho> that's quite subjective :)

[22:26:41] <manicennui> I mean, just read it.
[22:27:04] <brennen> this is only irony if one hasn't shed the culture-default prejudice against perl.
[22:27:26] <jj5> manicennui: the problem with your regex is it replaces *one* space with a tab, but I think the spec was for *two*, can you patch your implementation?
[22:27:45] <manicennui> jj5: No, it replaces any number of spaces with the same number of tabs.
[22:27:48] <ngoldbaum> can i not like perl for principled reasons?
[22:28:06] <brennen> well i won't get in your way, at any rate
[22:28:21] *** Parts: l554 (~l554@172.58.220.121) ()
[22:28:48] <jj5> manicennui: yes but how to replace with half the number of spaces as tabs?
[22:28:58] <manicennui> Just add the calculation.
[22:29:07] <manicennui> length($1) / 2
[22:29:31] <jj5> ah yes, of course. then there's the possibility for rounding error
[22:29:50] <jj5> i.e. what will happen when input has five leading spaces?
[22:30:33] <technomancy`> insert a half-width tab

[22:33:19] <manicennui> Change the regex. s/^( {2})+
[22:33:31] <geoffwozniak> Wasn't the original problem to replace each space with a tab?
[22:33:51] <manicennui> geoffwozniak: That's what I thought, so that's what I did.
[22:33:58] <manicennui> All of these other things are possible with small tweaks.
[22:34:02] <geoffwozniak> Seems like the Perl solution is pretty simple
[22:34:10] <manicennui> And nothing is going to do this better than Perl.
[22:34:21] <jj5> manicennui: yes, I think that will work. well done!
[22:34:51] <jj5> would this also work?: s/^(  )+/ ..?

[22:35:16] <manicennui> jj5: Sure.

[22:38:42] <c355e3b> im sure you could do that in hardware
[22:39:20] <geoffwozniak> Probably, but not likely on the hardware I've been working with lately
[22:39:30] <companion_cube> you need virtual memory, right?
[22:40:12] <geoffwozniak> Yeah, you need some sort of address translation mechanism
[22:40:49] <geoffwozniak> If pointers are always pointing at raw memory, you can't use the same trick
[22:43:11] <geoffwozniak> But with guaranteed contiguous memory that doesn't move you can use pointer arithmetic to get something pretty quick, I expect
[22:43:55] <kline> c355e3b, replace only leading spaces with \t ?
[22:44:07] <geoffwozniak> Might be fun to benchmark that, actually...

[23:12:57] <riv> > In early January 2010, GNAA VP of Operations Rucas embedded Javascript into Last Measure which would cause visitors using the Mozilla Firefox web browser to connect to Freenode and spam arbitrary messages. This was used to great effect by spamming links to Last Measure, whereby unsuspecting users would visit the links and send out spam, thereby getting banned themselves, and further propagating the attack. More technical details of this attack, and
[23:12:57] <riv> a more in-depth view of its effects, are available at Firefox XPS IRC Attack. This attack also lead to the formation of the GNAA's own security research firm, Goatse Security.
