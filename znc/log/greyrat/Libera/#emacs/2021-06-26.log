[02:08:57] <technomancy> how can I keep myself from opening a huge pile of windows any time I want to scroll down? anyone else run into this
[02:09:08] <wasamasa> you'd be better off figuring out what magit is running for you and write some corresponding elisp
[02:09:14] <wasamasa> or study magit's manual and customize it

[08:35:59] <bpalmer> itsmemoria: defcustom can specify a link to variable documentation, but it requires work so is rarely done; it can specify a labe/tag to use instead of making up something based on the variable name, but it too requires work so is rarely done. Most of the time, Foo Bar Baz  will be the variable foo-bar-baz
[08:36:09] <bpalmer> so, C-h v circle-highlight-nick-type RET and see what comes up
[08:36:12] <bpalmer> er, circe
[08:36:55] <itsmemoria> @bpalmer oh thank you. That is the correct variable name. How did you find that name?
[08:37:16] <bpalmer> it's each word that you wrote out, but downcased and joined together with -
[08:38:22] <bpalmer> that's the default way that customize will label a variable. (well, the opposite transformation: splitting on - and then title-casing each word)
[08:38:47] <itsmemoria> I see!! Thank you!!
[08:39:29] <bpalmer> that said, I don't think there's any particular virtue in avoiding customize and using setq
[08:39:39] <bpalmer> There are some variables that should only be set via customize.
[08:40:05] <bpalmer> So if your configuration grows without limit, you'll need to end up with some custom-set-variables forms regardless.
[08:40:55] <itsmemoria> that's great to know.

[09:11:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I know I had.
[09:11:55] <itsmemoria> it has been a while now
[09:12:06] <itsmemoria> so I don't really remember what happened back then
[09:12:18] <itsmemoria> in my case it was the whole tool chain
[09:12:29] <itsmemoria> I mostly write Python scripts for boring stuff
[09:13:04] <itsmemoria> but still, Windows tool chain are so painful to work with, even with the help of cygwin or msys2

[10:05:53] <johnjay> if you had to assign up left down right to four keys, how would you do it?
[10:06:00] <johnjay> apparently in vim it's hjkl = left down up right
[10:06:06] <rdrg109> TIL Executing occur with a prefix argument (just C-u) will only list the ocurrences of the provided regular expression (the default behavior is to show the lines containing the regular expression). If a number N is provided (e.g. C-u 10), then N previous lines and next lines are listed for each line matching the regular expression.

[10:07:42] <johnjay> i don't see why you would ever use C-u though
[10:08:00] <johnjay> it just shows the matched expression. so if you do C-u M-x occur defun it just prints "defun" a zillion times
[10:08:39] <rdrg109> johnjay: If I were to decide whether I should do that or not. I wouldn't dare since the arrow keys have some important meanings in some modes (e.g. in org mode, they are used to move headlines when pressing them with Alt)

[10:10:02] <rdrg109> johnjay: I think that C-u occur is useful for regular expressions. Let's say you have a text file which contain numbers scattered in multiplgra paragraphs and you only want to focus in the numbers, then you would do C-u M-x occur [0-9]+ RET
[10:10:28] <rdrg109> s/multiplgra paragraphs/multiple paragraphs/

[12:39:54] <susam> irek: Sounds interesting. I will join today and just lurk around. I am not what one would call an Emacs power user. I use it mainly for writing code and for Common Lisp + SLIME. Hoping I can pick something of value from the meetup.
[12:42:13] <susam> We have been planning to do something similar at #offbeat channel (excuse the shameless plug). It is a book club channel with free-form discussions around specific chosen books. We meet up once everyday to discuss analytic number theory. Gradually as we got to know each other we realized that majority of the channel has Common Lisp and Emacs users too. So we plan to start some Emacs and Common Lisp reading 
[12:42:19] <susam> sessions too.
[12:43:40] <susam> The fact that most people who joined there for math discussions somehow happened to be Emacs users too was quite interesting. I wonder what the link is.

[14:09:21] <bhavin192> gnoo, :( ideally it should move past that blue background with dots. I was using Firefox as well.

[14:11:25] <gnoo> i gues asking for a direct link to stream using mpv is asking too much?
[14:12:23] <bhavin192> gnoo, haha, I think so. Not sure if BigBlueButton supports that out of the box. 
[14:13:22] <gnoo> np, i'll likely join the meeting another month
[14:13:28] <gnoo> if times gives
[14:13:52] <bhavin192> gnoo, sure, do join if you are around next time :)

[19:29:47] <spikemaster> k. i'm not sure about vanilla emacs, but in evil you can adjust the cursor appearance like this: http://paste.debian.net/1202495/

[19:31:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm going to guess it applies changes on state transitions and simply messes with cursor's background color face.
[19:31:09] <spikemaster> for vanilla emacs looks like you can adjust the cursor like this: (setq-default cursor-type '(bar . 2))

[22:57:41] <splntr> Hi could need some help. I dont understand how regex works in emacs. A regex search with emacs M-x re-builder ^[\s]+[0-9]+$  finds everything fine. However in M-x search-forward-regexp it dosnst work. Any ideas why or how to understand what to change on the regex syntax?
[22:58:45] <ahungry> Sometimes some regex commands require extra escaping
[22:58:55] <ahungry> I think re-builder avoids the extra escape syntax 
[22:59:36] *** Quits: alex11 (~alex11@user/alex11) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:00:45] <roto> I never understood why those commands not just insert that extra escaping and avoids the cognitive difficulty. I mean, just let us use regular expressions normally

[23:04:26] <irek> splntr: The thing is that Emacs has 4 types of regex.  While in regexp-builder press "C-c TAB" to switch between them.  And to pass regex as a string to functions you need escape "escape" char as far as I know.
