[09:15:18] <Zipheir> Looks like string-trim-both is also affected.

[13:59:14] <s-liao> As I came back to see the whole conversation. I was talking with @amazigh about the solution of validating of the JSON file in #Scheme  Channel. you joined the conversion, you said "JSON is an underspecified serialization format" . I said that "JSON is potential for the serialization format, but it is still in the phrase, serialize JS object"
[13:59:14] <s-liao> .Then I found the test case of json-serialize and json-parse-string in Emacs-27.1, which doesn't have serialized the data of type list, then chatted that as well in #emacs channel. After that, I found out there is an egg s11n, which can serialize arbitrary objects in Chicken Implementation.  This solution is much better that what it has the
[13:59:15] <s-liao> integration solution for serializing and de-serializing the objects in Emacs.There is not reasonable for you have the such conclude "you go and figure out the wonders of language and meaning yourself".
[13:59:23] <s-liao> wasamasa
[14:16:53] <s-liao> Yes. I wonders too much. I wonder the concept is not clearly enough, then start to implement. I wonder the process does not help people to navigate the knowledge for coding , and then wait for such a long time to get support, then can go forward.
