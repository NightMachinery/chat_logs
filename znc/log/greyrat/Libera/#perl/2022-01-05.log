[01:52:22] <ether> LeoNerd: well, in go it's for idx, val := range ...,  so maybe call it range()?
[01:52:50] <LeoNerd> range() sounds like a function that'll just give you a list  $x..$y  for some x/y

[01:54:38] <vague> LeoNerd, ishift ?
[01:54:47] <ether> it has 'each' in it though
[01:55:10] <ether> although each really is the right metaphor here - because each() returns the "index" with the value for hashes
[01:55:17] <LeoNerd> "each_with_index" is a long icky name.. I don't like that either.
[01:55:19] <ether> and each() worked for arrays at some point too didn't it?
[01:55:32] <LeoNerd> "ishift" suggests a modification of the underlying list, which this isn't
[01:55:32] <gordonfish> eachi?
[01:55:40] <simcop2387> evalall: my @a=5..10; [each @a]

[01:56:53] <simcop2387> yea looks like since 5.12 for perl each works on arrays

[01:59:10] <vague> LeoNerd, peek ? With a nod to basic :)
[01:59:12] <ether> 5.032 is very new so you should be fine. but you need the 'use experimental "postderef"' line.
[01:59:32] <LeoNerd> Hah.. a "peek" would suggest some arbitrary memory lookup of the type I don't really want to write :P

[01:59:43] <gamo> thanks again ether
[01:59:56] <ether> $lolref->@* or @{$lolref} or @$lolref
[02:00:09] <ether> you can remove the extra curlies if there's nothing following
[02:00:18] <gordonfish> $#{$lolref} can be just $#$lolref too when dealing with a single variable that's a ref.
[02:00:28] <revhippie> be sure you know wether you're dealing with an array or an array reference, too.
[02:00:44] <revhippie> gamo keeps referring to @LoL, and we keep referring to $lolref.

[03:16:11] <gamo> There is here an expert in recent versions of perl I can talk to?
[03:16:33] <simcop2387> many, what kind of questions do you have
[03:16:37] <daemon> pretty much the entire channel, post your question - if someone wants to help they will
[03:17:03] <gamo> I have done already.
[03:17:44] <daemon> might be worth a repeat
[03:17:51] <simcop2387> i don't see any questions since ether was last helping you and answered all of yours
[03:19:18] <gamo> ok. push @a, @b;  push @a, @c; $r=evaluate(@a); sub evaluate { my $aoa = @_ ;  
[03:19:21] <simcop2387> if it's just about the passing an array to a sub so you can change it just pass it as a reference.  @ret = my_func(\@LoL); sub my_func {my ($LoL) = @_; ... $LoL->[$idx1][$idx2] ...; return ...}

[03:21:14] <daemon> hmm you know now days I only really use $scalar = [] / {} and de-ref where required I generally never have @array or %hash anywhere
[03:21:16] <simcop2387> push @a, @b; will put the list in there, not a reference to the contents of @b.  so it'd all be the same as @a=(@b, @c); which isn't a list of lists.  you probably want push @a, \@b; push @a, \@c; or @a=(\@b, \@c);

[03:23:57] <simcop2387> pairs is an interesting idea there
[03:24:21] <aquanight> but I assume you're attempting to recreate for my ($index, $item) (%array[keys @array]) { ... }
[03:24:22] <simcop2387> short, similar language to each, and would be useful in some other contexts too
[03:24:48] <aquanight> pairs %hash
[03:24:50] <simcop2387> for my ($idx, $val) (pairs @array) { ... }
[03:25:00] <aquanight> (redundant since %hash is already key/value pairs)

[03:26:30] <gamo> that is worth to try 
[03:26:35] <gamo> too
[03:26:47] <aquanight> gamo: that's not a real, I'm spitballing ideas of things
[03:27:07] <gamo> ah, ok
[03:27:20] <aquanight> hmm
[03:27:28] <simcop2387> gamo: almost, your first loop there will be getting values out of $aoa not indexes, you'll want to do: for my $i (0..$aoa->$#*) { for my $j ( 0..$aoa->[$i]->$#*) { ... } }
[03:27:58] <simcop2387> and then for a look up of the value in that place, $aoa->[$i][$j] inside that ... area
[03:28:16] <gamo> really I'll be fine if I only get the $j index for my task
[03:28:37] <simcop2387> yea youll have the two indexes $i and $j inside that loop
[03:29:03] <aquanight> for my $x ( 0 .. $#aoa ) { for my $y ( 0 .. $aoa[$x]->$#* ) { ...
[03:29:07] <aquanight> this is the usual pattern
[03:29:34] <simcop2387> the parts with ->$#* can also be rewritten as $#$aoa and $#{$aoa->[$i} respectively but they're kind of horrificly ugly and harder to parse usually
[03:29:37] <aquanight> for indexless iteration, you can instead: for my $r ( @aoa ) { for my $c ( @$r ) { ... } }

[03:43:38] <skyl4rk> Dancer2 question: I'm building DB backed login and lockout-ip-on-too-many-wrong-tries functionality, I'm building moo modules encapsulating the functionality, and passing the db handle from the main app which uses Dancer2::Plugin::Database. Idiomatically speaking, it feels like I'm barking up the wrong tree, as the dancer app does not have a new() sub where I would initialize my auth checker object
[03:43:40] <skyl4rk> instances. I realize this is pretty vague, but would writing the auth checkers as dancer plugins, and then have those plugins either have their own DB connection, or reuse the main app's connection be a "cleaner"/more idiomatic way?
[03:44:10] <skyl4rk> (this might be too specific for a general perl channel, in that case, sorry)
[03:44:24] <daemon> ok this might be my irc client being strange
[03:44:35] <daemon> I know the shrug emoticon shows up normally but I just looked at someone else doing it
[03:44:37] <daemon> and it code blocked it
[03:44:42] <simcop2387> hrm maybe i've got it falling back to droid mono for those then
[03:45:10] <simcop2387> that might be my support then, i've got the debian package fonts-droid-fallback
[03:45:52] <daemon> think its actually a regression on my side 
[03:45:58] <daemon> it used to work not it does not, hmmm
[03:45:59] <gamo> Still don't works.  So the question should be what is the most primitive way of do it?
[03:46:16] <simcop2387> gamo: what do you mean, doesn't work?
[03:46:27] <daemon> gamo, explain clearly what you are trying to achieve
[03:46:55] <gamo> Global symbol "@aoa" requires explicit package name (did you forget to declare "my @aoa"?) at centralita line 102.
[03:47:02] <daemon> skyl4rk, yeah dancer2 is really pretty old, you might be lucky but its probably better off on a mailing list or forum for dancer2 
[03:47:14] <daemon> gamo, explain clearly what you are trying to achieve
[03:47:31] <gamo> if I use a ref in step i it backfire me in step j
[03:47:35] <daemon> gamo, explain clearly what you are trying to achieve
[03:48:39] <gamo> yes: to pass a list of list to a function and use it freeeeeeeeeeeeeeely
[03:49:07] <daemon> simcop2387, my irc client recently updated as well I think it has done something strange

[03:50:43] <simcop2387> gamo: start with what i just put there
[03:52:26] <skyl4rk> daemon: thanks. Old doesn't bother me fortunately (I'd probably used cgi if it weren't for everyone seemingly running for the alarm switch when that happens). I think I saw a note about a dancer2-specific irc channel somewherein the cpan docs, but it's on a different channel so I thought I'd ask here as a first try.
[03:53:16] <daemon> skyl4rk, :) if it is on 'freenode' its now dead, though dancer2 was used quite a lot it might still exist even on here, all freenode channels moved to libera effectively (well 99% of them)

[03:54:29] <skyl4rk> yeah, I moved here when my usual stomping ground moved, which was pretty much immediately
[03:54:41] <simcop2387> yes, #dancer on irc.perl.org
[03:54:48] <skyl4rk> simcop2387: that might be it, it was something perl-specific that much i remember
[03:55:10] <daemon> skyl4rk, also ... its very likely there are people who did use dancer (potentially still do) in this channel, most likely have gone to catalyst or mojolicious but yeah ... its going to be one of those 'need to be on at the right time' type situations
[03:57:01] <gamo> solved! the problem resides in push documentation
[03:57:02] <skyl4rk> true, as is the case with irc. well I have a bouncer so I can read answers should anyone ping me later, but I don't expect people to read the scrollback just to answer my questions

[03:57:11] <gamo>             Treats ARRAY as a stack by appending the values of LIST to the
[03:57:11] <gamo>             end of ARRAY.
[03:57:32] <skyl4rk> any way, this is a small enough issue that "try it and see how it turns out" is a valid attempt at a solution
[03:57:33] <daemon> skyl4rk, under such situations I generally ask the question at around a 6 hour interval for a day or two, that seems to hit most timezones - for a maximum of 2 days

[06:32:26] <aquanight> so there's a warning for it but how bad is it really to exit a sub via dynamic next/last
[06:32:38] <aquanight> like if you're doing it on purpose what kind of footguns are you dealing with
[06:34:03] <Adura> Just as bad as any use of eval to ignore things?
[06:35:46] <aquanight> well I wasn't sure if there's like some kind of side effect of breaking out of things this way. Dynamic next/last can make for an interesting way to break out of arbitrary call chains.

[06:37:48] <aquanight> ... blah. of course C ruins everything.
[06:38:12] <aquanight> simcop2387: well they should probably mortalize their temps
[06:38:35] <simcop2387> it might not be much of an issue anymore but j havent done it in years
[06:39:07] <simcop2387> try/catch i  the next perl is a better way to do it
[06:39:30] <simcop2387> esp with the new defer stuff
[06:39:54] <simcop2387> eval: defer { say " Wprld!"} say hello
[06:39:55] <perlbot> simcop2387: Unquoted string "hello" may clash with future reserved word at (IRC) line 1. ERROR: Bareword filehandle "hello" not allowed under 'no feature "bareword_filehandles"' at (IRC) line 1. 
[06:40:00] <simcop2387> bah
[06:40:08] <simcop2387> eval: defer { say " Wprld!"} say "hello"
[06:40:09] <perlbot> simcop2387: hello  Wprld! 
[06:40:10] <aquanight> I mean ultimately I guess. I was thinking about leveraging dynamic next/last for custom iteration scenarios.
[06:40:19] <aquanight> that aren't comfortably expressed with foreach
[06:41:00] <simcop2387> what about do {} while(0) to avoid the warnings?  i.e. loops that only execute once
[06:41:05] <simcop2387> a hack but welll
[06:41:21] <aquanight> the warning is because the dynamic next/last terminates a subroutine frame
[06:41:48] <aquanight> with a :prototype(&...) scenario, the "block" is a full sub
[06:41:57] <aquanight> so if you abuse dynamic next/last for it, you get warnings
[06:44:25] <aquanight> the theory was some driver sub which implements custom iteration logic and uses a :prototype(&...) to call the iteration block. The driver places a label "ITEM" on a suitable looping block, and the iteration block can use redo/next/last ITEM; like a normal loop could.
[06:45:26] <aquanight> but you can't inject 'no warnings "exiting";' to silence the warning into the block
[06:45:31] <aquanight> at least, not easily.
[06:46:02] <aquanight> sweval: prototype("CORE::next")
[06:46:03] <perlbot> aquanight: No output.
[06:46:35] <aquanight> sweval: use subs 'redo'; sub redo { say "test"; } for (1..5) { redo; }
[06:46:41] <aquanight> ... timeout
[06:46:47] <perlbot> aquanight: [Died SIGKILL]
[06:46:52] <aquanight> called it
[06:47:58] <aquanight> you can't override next/last/redo directly, so if you wanted to "squirrel away" the scary warnings you'd have to spell the keywords differently which makes your loop a second-class citizen
[06:49:06] <aquanight> and of course I can already predict someone arguing for a no feature 'dynamic_next'; to force next LABEL; to be lexically valid

[18:00:13] <corwin> while there remain lines to read from STDIN, selects a number between 0 and the current line number.  if that rand number < 1 set $line to the current line.

[18:00:42] <LeoNerd> rand($.) is some random value between zero and up to that number

[18:01:44] <LeoNerd> It might be. It has a small chance of being

[18:02:15] <LeoNerd> It's anywhere from zero up to (excluding) the argument
[18:04:38] <simcop2387> it's a fun statistics trick that doing things that way will have a uniform probability of picking any element from the list of lines in the file.  assuming your random number generator is uniformly random
[18:05:21] <hethw> but it only evaluates values under 1?

[18:22:09] <hethw> thanks
[18:22:45] <simcop2387> revhippie: yep, and if you start doing the math it ends up that line 1 has a 1/N probability of staying as the selected line by the time you get to line N.  because each choice is independant and uniform (if either of those conditions are violated then it doesn't work)
[18:23:11] <hethw> can't we just go to line random and read it?
[18:23:48] <LeoNerd> No
[18:23:53] <LeoNerd> That's not how files work. Files are byte-addressible
[18:24:02] <hethw> I guess we can't seek to a line
[18:24:10] <hethw> so it's the same as reading it
[18:24:13] <fizzie> You'd have to know in advance how many lines there are, to choose a "line random". And even then, finding the line would involve reading up to it.
[18:24:16] <LeoNerd> You can jump to e.g. the 1000th byte, but you can't know which numbered line that would be
[18:24:30] <hethw> I know how long is the file beforehand it's static
[18:24:31] <simcop2387> hethw: you can sort of seek to a line, but you end up reading the whole file to do that
[18:24:32] <pragma-> You could seek to a random byte and then seek backwards (or forwards) to the first newline and then print the line that appears there.
[18:24:46] <simcop2387> pragma-: that'll bias towards longer lines though
[18:24:50] <LeoNerd> The "simple" way to pick a line at random is to read all the lines into an array, store them all, then pick one randomly from that. It works but it consumes lots of memory just to throw most of them away
[18:24:53] <pragma-> But you don't know how long the lines are and one very, very, very long line could end up getting hit more often.
[18:24:57] <pragma-> simcop2387: right

[18:25:28] <LeoNerd> The fancy trick is to store -one- line in memory all the time, each time reading one extra line and possibly replacing the one you're storing with the new one... by the time you get to the end of the file, each line will have had an equal random chance of being the one you saved
[18:25:34] <hethw> I guess we're reading it eitherway
[18:25:34] <LeoNerd> without needing to know in advance how many there are
[18:25:46] <LeoNerd> Yes; either way you read the entire file. You just don't need to *store* the entire file
[18:25:56] <LeoNerd> The entire file could be huge, but we don't need to remember all of it. Just one line
[18:25:57] <fizzie> If you're willing to change the file format, you can of course start with an index of N offsets of where each line starts.

[18:26:07] <hethw> fizzie, smart
[18:26:11] <simcop2387> alright kernel upgrade to get android support working on my laptop.  should be interesting in the future.
[18:26:25] <Altreus> The first line of the file will always be picked ...
[18:26:42] <Altreus> I guess it relies on another line being picked
[18:27:01] <LeoNerd> Yes; at the point when the file only has one line, that line was certain to have been picked
[18:27:16] <LeoNerd> The trick is that after every line, all the lines you've seen *up to that point* have been equally likely
[18:27:30] <Altreus> that makes sense
[18:27:33] <hethw> that should be ok it's random from 1 choice
[18:27:43] <Altreus> there's a 1/5 chance that line 5 is picked, a 1/6 chance that line 6 is picked...
[18:28:18] <Altreus> I never thought of probability from that perspective
[18:28:29] <LeoNerd> It's a fairly standard trick
[18:28:38] <LeoNerd> I thought everyone knew that one, so I didn't explain it at first.. heh.
[18:28:46] <Altreus> If there's a 1/n chance that item n is picked, then there's a 1/n-1 chance that a given one of the other ones is picked
[18:29:32] <Altreus> nice
[18:33:45] <fizzie> Or alternatively: there's a 1/n chance the last line was picked, and a (1-1/n)*(1/(n-1)) = (n-1)/n * (1/(n-1)) = 1/n chance the second-to-last-line was picked, and so on.

[23:21:22] <sbrothy> ok done. man.
[23:21:30] <sbrothy> 10 minutes?!
[23:21:42] <LeoNerd> Might have had a deep dependency chain
[23:21:44] <sbrothy> it better work then :P
[23:21:51] <sbrothy> indeed
[23:21:55] <LeoNerd> Also don't forget that perl modules actually come with unit tests so you can be reasonably sure the things are working
[23:22:05] <LeoNerd> Unlike most other languages which just copy files around, cross fingers and hope

[23:24:42] <sbrothy> yeh. it works. gtood ole perl. it complains about "diagnostics tho. should i just force install it?

[23:30:08] <sbrothy> could this be because I prebiously used "sudo" to invoke "perl -MCPAN" but forgot this time (even though it asked my if it should sudo)?
[23:30:54] <sbrothy> im forcing installation of this to /usr/local tho so i guess i can just use "/usr/bin" if im in doubt. does this make sense at all?
[23:31:17] <sbrothy> ech nevermind. ill blitz the whole virutal server it goes haywire
[23:32:55] <sbrothy> seriously, ive never seen anything like this. obviously im in way over my head. thank god it isnt mission critical
[23:34:55] <sbrothy> im flabbergasted. the illusion of control is exhillarting. why ppl run windows is beyond me. :)
