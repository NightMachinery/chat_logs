[19:39:35] <lantech19446> god by the time i'm good enough at coding to apply for a devops job devops won't even exist anymore
[19:46:20] *** Joins: dme86 (~dan@user/dan86)
[19:47:24] <rawtaz> haha
[19:47:41] <rawtaz> what youre doing now is closer to system administration and arguably devops than programming i suppose
[19:47:43] <slaughter> lol
[19:48:14] <rawtaz> perhaps you should just look for work at MSPs (Managed Service Providers)?
[19:48:47] <slaughter> There's tons of devops jobs out there that would be stoked you're even trying. I've seen lots of "some bash/powershell and/or python preferred" where they don't even expect you to know shell scripting
[19:48:54] <slaughter> Which is insane to me but just highlights they exist
[19:49:25] <slaughter> You might be able to slide sideways directly into SRE roles - an actual SRE role rarely requires programming skills
[19:49:52] <lantech19446> I honestly don't really want to move on right now, it's worth dealing with the lower pay for the kind of benefits i get but I still want to learn devops and eventually get into a role in it. I've been trying for weeks to code this script though and I could never quite get it someone else did it for me in 4 lines
[19:50:02] <dodo> yeah, devops is about dev and ops collaborating, not doing both. though it helps to know both
[19:50:27] <dodo> what kind of script?
[19:51:10] <slaughter> Devops should 100% be about doing both - ideally an actual "devops" position wouldn't exist because you have a devops culture that educates and allows the devs to handle ops. But what do I know with my devops title
[19:51:30] <lantech19446> i had a json file that's generated every day at 2PM and I need to pull very specific information out of it specifically when certain urls are requested and how many hits and visitors it gets that day
[19:52:50] <lantech19446> slaughter: from what i gather in larger environments knowing how to code or at least script really is an ops skill too. At my level that's not necessarily true
[19:53:00] <dodo> devops is definitely not about having devs handle ops. that leads to lots of breakage because developers don't have ops skill just because they get access..
[19:53:41] <dodo> lantech19446: yeah, more ops stuff can be automated with dev skills
[19:54:19] <slaughter> OG devops culture as described vs actual real world devops in action dodo - I pretty much agree with you in most cases, definitely haven't spent the last year picking up after a devs handling ops situation (with 0 devops culture, though...)
[19:54:28] <dodo> having one person who does multiple roles is usually an indicator of cutting cost.. 
[19:55:00] <dodo> yeah
[19:55:19] <slaughter> I got into devops through the 
[19:55:21] <slaughter> Ugh
[19:55:39] <slaughter> Through the "dev that learns ops and applies devops culture and ideals to the work"
[19:56:00] <dodo> nice
[19:56:03] <lantech19446> I suspect i'm going to wind up liking coding more than admin it's a different kind of problem solving much more creative at least to me but right now i lack some serious skillz lol
[19:56:06] <slaughter> And in a small shop I'd 100% say it's valid. Once you grow past small shop it's more challenging
[19:56:18] <slaughter> lantech19446 just keep at it, you'll get it
[19:56:57] <lantech19446> I am I mean i see progress in myself it's just not progress that's going to be helpful yet
[19:57:12] <slaughter> One thing to think about with your issue (JSON) is "is code the right tool for this job". Sounds to me like you have an excuse there to learn/play with jq, which gets you some time fighting shell scripts and using a SUPER useful/common tool
[19:57:19] <lantech19446> I am starting to use the google fu to try to figure stuff out that's more advanced but i'm still hazy on some of the basic principala
[19:57:58] <lantech19446> never heard of jq I'll check it out
[19:58:23] <slaughter> Never heard of jq? Woahhhhh welcome to heaven it's like fighting an alligator to get a pearl out of it's throat
[19:58:42] <slaughter> I guess you're doing windows admin though so jq is a step removed there
[19:59:06] <dodo> lantech19446: fwiw, if you get stuck, you can try find help on irc
[19:59:28] <dodo> it's hard to find stuff when you don't know what you're looking for
[19:59:42] <lantech19446> also my network is soooo small man i implemented ansible because i wanted to learn ansible but i could just as easily walk to every computer in my domain and do the same thing
[20:00:03] <lantech19446> we're so small I can't even come up with something to use docker for
[20:00:04] <dodo> eh, walking..
[20:00:28] <dodo> lantech19446: my first use case was a python script that broke after an os upgrade. decided to isolate the script
[20:01:10] <dodo> it was some personal script. don't need size for docker ;)
[20:01:11] <lantech19446> i've been using virtual environment setups for my python so I can control what interpreter gets used
[20:01:31] <dodo> and then suddenly your python version is gone
[20:01:48] <dodo> just saying. venvs are great, but not as isolated as a container
[20:01:49] <lantech19446> I'm gonna learn it eventually I already bought the server for it I just don't know what to do with it
[20:02:19] <dodo> fwiw, at home i also use portainer to run a few services. it's fun and useful
[20:02:39] <dodo> not sure though, might be better to start on the command line, you get more insight
[20:03:26] <lantech19446> it's a linux server so i only have command line

[20:19:19] <rawtaz> i think its pretty easy to tell if a person can be a good programmer or not by looking at how they approach it all when trying to learn about it
[20:19:26] <rawtaz> i havent seen you so i cant say
[20:19:35] <rawtaz> but its clear as day in others ive seen
[20:19:57] <rawtaz> either they get it or they dont. those who doesnt pretty much never become good programmers
[20:20:26] <lantech19446> I was able to get a third of the information I needed but I didn't know how to search deeper in the document turns out i was reading it wrong to begin with I think if i had figured that out i could have done it myself, not as elegantly as this person did but it would have done what i needed it too

[21:09:30] <kwilczynski> Or the Japanese...
[21:09:32] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:09:47] <dodo> orly? til
[21:10:25] <kwilczynski> Ever wondered why, by default, colour of the status balls in Jenkins are blue by default? And there exist an extension to change the colour to green? :)
[21:11:03] <dodo> heh. i remembered it the other way around? then i must have installed green balls, not blue balls
[21:11:31] <kwilczynski> Or why "green forest" in Japanese is aomori? :) "ao" being blue.
[21:11:47] <kwilczynski> So much weird stuff!
[21:12:06] <dodo> humans are messy
[21:12:44] <kwilczynski> Yes. Yucky cumans.
[21:12:46] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:13:38] <kwilczynski> The Ferengi were right.
[21:14:22] <slaughter> Aren't there like weird things about color perception related to language?
[21:15:00] <slaughter> I remember reading about an African tribe that had multiple names for shades of green/brown/blue so they had some crazy extra perception there, but didn't have any concept of like red or purple or something at all 
[21:16:00] <dodo> that's pretty common, if the colors are significant
[21:16:46] <dodo> what i find interesting is that you have to be trained to even hear certain letters or sounds. when they're not used in your language you might not be able to hear them properly
[21:17:16] <dodo> french apparently uses a very narrow frequence range, so french people tend to have more difficulties learning foreign languages
[21:17:22] <dodo> frequency

[21:21:36] <slaughter> Well if they'd pronounce any of the letters in their words it wouldn't be so bad
[21:21:39] <slaughter> French drives me nuts
[21:24:13] <kwilczynski> Le French drive a lot of people nuts :p
[21:24:38] <kwilczynski> Look at their crosaints!
[21:24:52] <kwilczynski> How do you even say that correctly!
[21:25:04] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:25:29] <dodo> easy, be a frenchman ;)
[21:25:38] <dodo> croissant btw
[21:25:39] <slaughter> "cusah" 
[21:25:45] <slaughter> hue hue
[21:26:36] <kwilczynski> Heheh 
[21:28:28] <kwilczynski> I had almost to beaten up in Brussels once.
[21:29:13] <kwilczynski> For trying to order an espresso and a cross-ain't-ttt... 
[21:30:04] <kwilczynski> The weiter had a rant and got fiercely annoyed when I settled on calling it "the thing, the French muffin" :)
[21:32:02] <kwilczynski> OK 
[21:32:09] <kwilczynski> I will stop using dictation hehe
[21:32:17] <kwilczynski> It gets 80% right.
[21:32:20] <kwilczynski> LOL 
[21:32:39] <kwilczynski> I guess the future is not quite here yet.
