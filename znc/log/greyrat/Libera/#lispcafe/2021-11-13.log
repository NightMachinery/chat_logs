[11:21:42] -ixelp- Why Lisp? | Hacker News
[11:22:24] <dave0> an awesome comment (the thread was about languages backwards compatibility)
[11:22:27] <dave0> Ah, but code written in Common Lisp in 2021 will usually work in 1995, after -26 years
[11:22:35] <dave0> That really is amazing. Is it true, even "usually", for most types of code? Both forwards and backwards compatibility.. it's like the holy grail
[11:24:26] <phantomics> Common Lisp allows time travel?
[11:25:42] <dave0> it's pretty bad-ass
[11:29:32] <gilberth> For one thing it has a character data type. Code from 1990 will just happily run today, although today you probably have Unicode, while in the 90s were perhaps stuck to 7-bit US-ASCII.
[11:32:30] <gilberth> And in general the language is very machine and environment independent. This might be a bit cumbersome at times, but it has the right abstractions wrt numbers, characters, and the file system.
[11:34:34] <dave0> maybe the unstated thing here is memory.. lots less memory in those days
[11:35:04] <gilberth> With advent of code points greater than 2^16-1 Java is already broken, Go will break if UTF-8 becomes out of fashion, and C only talks about bytes. Heck, even Perl is has struggles with UTF-8. Ever tried to ungetc() a character?
[11:36:29] <dave0> gilberth: you're biased because B32 has 32 bit characters which fits unicode easily ;-)
[11:37:11] <gilberth> dave0: All the code in McCLIM I wrote late 90s still works. As does the Clousre-XML parser and the Closure-HTML parser, which is a bit older. The lalr.cl I use is from 1988 and still works fine. Most of FORMAT and LOOP is older still.
[11:38:06] <gilberth> And I don't see why and how it should break in say 2045.
[11:38:37] <dave0> far out, 25 years
[11:38:44] <dave0> 2038 will be an interesting year
[11:39:03] <phantomics> Speaking of Java and Unicode, has anyone else run into weird character problems in ABCL? It chokes on the character 𝕊. If I eval (list #\𝕊) in ABCL it throws an error
[11:39:53] <gilberth> dave0: Not for us, we're safe.
[11:40:22] <dave0> gilberth: oh yes i remember reading that
[11:41:59] <dave0> separately counting in days and a separate unit for small times just makes so much sense
[11:42:15] <gilberth> phantomics: Problem with ABCL is that it borrows the idea to have strings UTF-16 encoded from Java. But so does Allegro CL. But (list #\S) is fine.
[11:42:23] <dave0> and then picking march 1st 2000 as an epoch is brilliant
[11:43:15] <gilberth> dave0: Why? A lot of file timestamps would be negative then.
[11:43:31] <dave0> gilberth: something to do with leap years
[11:44:12] <gilberth> dave0: 25 years is not so much. From now it would be 1996, and we have a lot of that old CL code running just fine.
[11:44:41] <phantomics> gilberth: but 𝕊 is within UTF-16 is it not? ABCL can handle strings including the character, but not the character quoted by itself
[11:44:44] <gilberth> dave0: I see. wasn't 2000 an exception to the exception?
[11:45:36] <gilberth> phantomics: #\S (US-ASCII S) ought to be fine.
[11:45:43] <dave0> gilberth: ah yes because it's divisible by 400
[11:46:21] <dave0> gilberth: starting with march 1st 2000, puts february 29 on some extremely regular pattern
[11:46:23] <phantomics> Problem with #\S is that I'm using this character for a reader macro so it needs to be something special not often used
[11:46:27] <gilberth> dave0: And by 100. IIRC there also is an exception for years = 0 (mod 100).
[11:47:06] <dave0> gilberth: feb 29 is always at the end of the period
[11:47:18] <gilberth> phantomics: S? US-ASCII 83 decimal? Or are you talking about another S?
[11:47:48] <phantomics> I'm talking about the double-struck S, maybe in your font it looks similar
[11:48:25] <phantomics> That's unicode 1d54a
[11:50:18] <phantomics> I guess that is outside the bounds of UTF-16, the double-struck chars more often used in math like C and R are closer to the beginning of the Unicode list and they can be read in ABCL just fine
[11:51:27] <gilberth> phantomics: You're IRC send US-ASCII S. But when it's outside 0..2^16-1 minus the surrugates, you're out of luck, ABCL can't represent them because it borrows its so called character data type from Java.
[11:52:37] <gilberth> Hence, it's outside the range of ABCL's "character" data type.
[11:52:46] <phantomics> That's a pain, and Allegro CL does the same?
[11:53:13] <gilberth> My version does, yes.
[11:54:15] <gilberth> To be fair, they introduced Unicode at a time where it was assumed that 2^16 code points would be enough.
[11:54:37] <gilberth> ABCL is lazy and ACL could have been fixed.
[11:55:29] <phantomics> What a pain, it's nice to have exotic chars for reader macros
[11:55:50] <phantomics> But I can find something within the range to replace them with
[11:56:34] <gilberth> It's still a pain and calling for disaster to happen to use sth beyond 7-bit for source files. A pity.
[11:57:53] <gilberth> As all kind of transports are fragile and files easily could get labeled wrong wrt the encoding used.
[11:58:19] <phantomics> Seeing as I'm writing an APL compiler, that cat's already out of the bag... at least the APL chars are within the 16-bit range
[12:01:29] <gilberth> At times there is confusion. E.g. with HTML. There is this <META CHARSET=...> tag, which is overruled by HTTP, and HTTP defaults to ISO-8859-1, which in practice is the Windows CP-$whatever, Some then take the CHARSET, some believe the HTTP Content-Type header, some guess; A mess.
[12:03:58] <gilberth> This is why my routines to generate HTML or JSON stick to US-ASCII.
[12:04:44] <gilberth> And JSON also borrows this silly UTF-16 encoding.

[12:06:56] <hayley> Also, I think an actual implementation of copy propagation uses global value numbering or something else, as I only get readable algorithms for GVN.
[12:07:12] <hayley> Here's just the microcode: https://github.com/no-defun-allowed/lc3-in-lc3/blob/master/vm/instructions.lisp
[12:07:12] -ixelp- lc3-in-lc3/instructions.lisp at master · no-defun-allowed/lc3-in-lc3 · GitHub
[12:07:35] <hayley> But perhaps it's lower than microcode, as performing instruction decoding requires several \mu-ops.
[12:08:04] <hayley> By the number of instructions run in the host VM, this VM is 400x slower than native.
[12:08:12] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, which doesn't give me much, as I would need to read the rest to figure out the semantics.
[12:08:58] <hayley> https://github.com/no-defun-allowed/lc3-in-lc3/blob/master/vm/microcode.lisp though it is full of kludged optimisations that my compiler^Wmacro assembler cannot do.

[12:10:03] <gilberth> hayley: IIRC the CADR needs around 20 µ-ops per macro op or so. Pretty slow. But then there are whole routines written in microcode, just because it's slow.
[12:10:47] <hayley> As I have no shifter, I have to do a bit scanning procedure to do LDB, which is probably pretty slow.
[12:10:48] <gilberth> But then, I keep repeating myself, the CADR design was not about speed, but about space.
[12:10:56] <hayley> Maybe I should write a profiler too.
[12:11:23] <hayley> Yes, I have to kludge so that the microcode and VM registers are within 256 words of each other, else I can't do PC-relative for everything.
[12:11:24] <gilberth> hayley: Can't you use self-modifying code?
[12:11:35] *** Quits: edgar-rft (~edgar-rft@HSI-KBW-109-193-249-223.hsi7.kabel-badenwuerttemberg.de) (Quit: Leaving)
[12:11:45] <hayley> gilberth: I don't have the guts for self-modifying code, and I just got a working VM yesterday.
[12:12:37] <hayley> Though, ironically, I now want a tracing JIT so that I can run LC3-in-LC3^4 in less than 20 minutes. The C++ VM puts out 140 MIPS, which isn't bad, but we know what compilation is like.
[12:12:39] <gilberth> That was just an idea. I suppose LDB is a macro instruction? Just stick the correct LDB ahead in your code and be set.
[12:13:14] <hayley> https://github.com/no-defun-allowed/lc3-in-lc3/blob/master/vm/bits.lisp#L5-L30
[12:13:14] -ixelp- lc3-in-lc3/bits.lisp at master · no-defun-allowed/lc3-in-lc3 · GitHub
[12:13:34] <hayley> IIRC there's one really obvious call to LDB which could be replaced with an AND instruction, but I haven't bothered.
[12:13:55] <gilberth> But I am biased, as with my B32 (itty TTL design), self modifying code is the only way to have indirect addressing or jumps.
[12:14:29] <hayley> Once you get to LC3-in-LC3^3, you can actually see the herald message being printed character by character.
[12:15:47] <gilberth> The CADR does this in a way, too. It has a register to be ORed into the next instruction. This way the microcode could have indirect addressing of its registers, or the BITBLT routine could stick the ALU op right into the data transfer instruction.
[12:16:13] <hayley> Maybe a one-entry TLB would be nice, rather than having to perform the LDB dance for every memory access and page table lookup. But I don't have any information for a TLB materialized, and it'd be slower for a cache miss if I did.
[12:16:51] <gilberth> Your baby has an MMU?
[12:17:06] <hayley> But the spatial locality of LC-3 programs can't be too bad, because my whole VM fits in 4 pages (1 page = 256 words).
[12:17:48] <hayley> gilberth: Sort of. The LC-3 has 64KW of memory, and if I want to put a LC-3 in a LC-3, I need to lie about how much RAM I have, and provide virtual memory.
[12:18:28] <hayley> The MMU is completely transparent to the guest VM.
[12:19:24] <gilberth> For code the LPC21xx microcontroler I used had a single 256 byte (or bit?) instruction cache line, as the flash ROM is pretty slow. Turned out that this really sped things up. So perhaps just one TLB entry for each of code and data would be a gain?
[12:20:14] <dave0> gilberth: my forth is coming along, it can now read a line of input, and execute words interactiely.. i have started to write the compiler... but soon i should be able to port it to your B32 !
[12:20:27] <hayley> Sure.
[12:20:33] <dave0> gilberth: then you can bootstrap a lisp in forth!
[12:21:17] <sham1> From a FORTH to a lisp. From RPN to FPN
[12:21:26] <gilberth> hayley: I never got around this, but for by TTL RISC design I contemplate a three entry TLB and rely on software to look at page tables. Never got around to run simulations. In real HW TLB, being associative memory, is expensive.
[12:21:30] <sham1> It's poetic, really
[12:21:51] <hayley> Oh, I just need to mask out the low bits of an address to have a "key" without LDB-ing.
[12:22:10] <gilberth> dave0: I'd rather do FORTH in Lisp. My machine is very bad with stacks.
[12:22:52] <gilberth> hayley: Yep.

[14:10:58] <hayley> Well, a TLB removes about 20% of dynamic instructions executed.

[16:41:08] <selwyn> spacemacs seems pretty
[16:48:03] <gilberth> What is that spacemacs that is mentioned here again and again. I can't tell.
[16:52:16] <selwyn> it is an emacs config
[16:53:17] <selwyn> now i can finally access my irc bouncer in emacs
[16:53:27] <gilberth> Labels being dynamic with Perl, is that an oversight?
[16:53:45] <shka> gilberth: in perl, difficult to say
[16:54:12] <shka> it is hard to distinguish decision from fuckup
[16:54:39] <shka> spacemacs is emacs config, simplifies further configuration by providing so called "layers"
[16:54:42] <gilberth> Well, it has perfectly working lexical closures otherwise. And the documentation reads as if labels would have been meant to have lexical scope, too. But they don't.
[16:55:10] <shka> and it comes with EVIL pre-configured 
[16:55:27] <shka> so if a person was using vim, and suddenly they want to code in lisp
[16:55:41] <shka> and slime happens to be for emacs...
[16:55:54] <shka> well that's how it started for me
[16:56:37] <gilberth> So I guess, spacemacs is not something I would need, nor want. Even the modern customize stuff is a layer too much for me.
[16:56:50] <shka> yeah
[16:57:37] <selwyn> i don't trust myself to set up a nice emacs on my own in reasonable time
[16:58:38] <gilberth> Most of the time, I fight new "features". Emacs, too, has a tendency to get worse with time.

[17:12:56] <gilberth> This is fragile, while all goto labels within a function are in scope, a labeled white seems to nest properly within a function. But the latter still are dynamically scoped.

[17:13:02] <shka> without a restart
[17:14:08] <gilberth> So when I am jumped at, I would need to verify that it's me, that was supposed to be jumped to and if not jump further to a samenamed label. Can't do with goto labels, but appears to work with loop labels.
[17:15:41] <gilberth> But we have special variables, called "local" variables and could maintain a nesting count. Pass the target nesting along with the goto^Wlast and verify at the target.
[17:16:22] <gilberth> This is no better than CATCH/THROW, so perhaps I punt and use CATCH/THROW for TAGBODY and BLOCK and be set.

[17:51:45] <shka> nope, tramp does not work
[17:52:01] <selwyn> reminded of theranos
[17:52:31] <shka> well, everybody with half of brain in the business knew that theranos was shit 
[17:52:34] <selwyn> strikes me that she scammed some evil people who you would have thought knew better
[17:54:12] <shka> god's of capitalism have a powerful medicine for that :P
[17:54:22] <shka> be like Steve Jobs
[17:54:27] <shka> be like Elon Musk
[17:54:35] <shka> and let them worship you
[17:54:57] <selwyn> meh
[17:55:21] <shka> i mean, read it up
[17:55:23] <selwyn> i think you have to get out early, and then you get to be loved still
[17:55:31] <selwyn> \maybe a different topic though
[17:55:38] <sham1> How is TRAMP not working out
[17:55:46] <shka> sham1: not with the vterm
[17:55:56] <shka> while eshell is great 
[17:56:05] <sham1> Ah I see, yeah
[17:56:07] * shka like the eshell
[17:56:21] <sham1> eshell is nice
[17:56:57] <shka> i don't see reason to run vterm over standalone terminal emulator
[17:57:00] <shka> but that's me
[17:57:22] <sham1> I do. Easier integration iwht rest of Emacs, although I'd just use ansi-term
[17:57:33] <selwyn> my use case is accessing the irc bouncer in an emacs buffer, without painful switching of windows
[17:58:16] <selwyn> so instead of wasting time switching between windows, i can waste time on #lispcafe when i should be working :p
[17:58:23] <shka> you don't have terminal emulator on windows?
[17:58:34] <selwyn> well, on windows i use putty to ssh in
[17:59:21] <selwyn> i have mingw64 for lisp dev on windows but i don't use it very much otherwise
[17:59:33] <selwyn> putty is very full featured

[18:44:14] <pjb> That said, the industrialization of teledildonics, is not done with emacs lisp or even lisp… It's coded in C with microcontrollers, and apps in Java or Objective-C…
[18:44:33] <pjb> At best, there may be some python in the server and sex-life tracking software…uuuu
[18:44:56] <pjb> So, I would say, missed opportunity, give that we clearly had the first prototypes there…
[18:46:35] <pjb> Now remember that the boss of realdolls wanted to work in AI, but since he couldn't get the budget to build AI in robotics, in went instead with sex dolls (with plans to integrate AI later.   So we could get a realdoll, and the SDK, and use emacs lisp (or Common Lisp), to develop its AI.

[18:51:55] <shka> i am desperate, but not THAT desperate 
[18:52:46] <pjb> In terms of robotics, it's quite an interesting problem.
