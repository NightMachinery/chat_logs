[05:15:06] <brianonymous> well.. it really depends on the case

[05:15:26] <brianonymous> you can pass stuff in to your constructor
[05:15:32] <brianonymous> you can set them externally

[05:16:34] <brianonymous> whether or not that initialization data comes in on the constructor is up to you

[05:18:13] <brianonymous> fair enough, its quite a massive subject
[05:18:22] <asa22> so I have a class with properties with getters and setters, and then a nested class within that class that also has its own properties with getters and setters
[05:18:38] <brianonymous> personally im not a fan of nested classes
[05:18:39] <asa22> when I create an object from the parent class what does the nested class part look like in the object?
[05:19:23] <brianonymous> the visibility of that nested class will be contained to the hosting class

[10:38:03] <jmer> every other work place I've had didn't inform me of this and just let me spend my vacation time on being sick :/
[10:39:00] <ap5> I have managed to end up in a team where we want to shift from onprem k8s to GCE k8s, switch from EF Core to dapper, and also currently looking into changing NATS/STAN out and pub Google pub/sub in. Oh: and going full head on with Postgres instead of MSSQL :D

[10:39:15] <jmer> nice
[10:39:29] <jmer> That sounds pretty sweet
[10:39:45] <ap5> jmer, i like ending up in a place where the focus is more on the worker than on making money, because... well, they make a lot of money
[10:39:53] <jmer> We use dapper allready except on one project where EF is broken, we're looking into redhat openshift for container stuff so we can get more end to end responsibility
[10:40:10] <ap5> We got a half months salary in christmas bonus this year. Pretty nice.
[10:40:35] <ap5> The first thing Sindberg and me did when we started was to advocate for dapper :D
[10:40:38] <jmer> ap5: Nice. Our manager told us that the bonus will be pretty good this year. allthough mine will only be based on the months of work I did not the entire year
[10:40:45] <jmer> because Dapper rocks
[10:40:51] <ap5> Oh yis
[10:41:01] <ap5> I like bonuses
[10:41:18] <ap5> I like getting money. My focus is not on the money, but i like getting 'em
[10:41:20] <jmer> we can get up to 5% of our yearly salary
[10:41:26] <jmer> money == freedom
[10:41:29] <ap5> Wauw :D
[10:41:31] <ap5> Nice
[10:41:42] <jmer> the goals that trigger the bonus are set in coop with the team.
[10:41:48] <jmer> so we can avoid unrealistic idiotic goals
[10:41:54] <ap5> Nice :D
[10:42:01] <jmer> and currently they want us to have a 20/80 split between new dev an maintenance/payment of tech debt

[16:10:22] <asa22> canton7 thanks
[16:11:04] <jmer> asa22:  they're called object initializers: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers
[16:13:09] <andrerav> asa22: if it's always three integers you can also consider using a tuple for a slightly cleaner syntax. In that case the object creation would be 'new SomeObject((1,2,3))' and the constructor signature is 'public SomeObject((int, int, int) p)'

[16:46:21] <ravindUwU> Hiyaa 👋
[16:47:19] <ravindUwU> With a foreign key defined as ON DELETE CASCADE, how would one actually use it? Can the cascading behaviour be invoked with a DELETE command? 🤔
[16:47:52] <ravindUwU> Like... DELETE FROM parent_entity WHERE ... with related children automatically deleted? 🤔
[16:47:56] <jmer> ravindUwU: what it means is that if you deleted something that has a reference ot another table instead of a foreign key constraint violation the DB will just delete that data...
[16:48:09] <jmer> Sometimes you want it, sometimes, you certainly don't
[16:48:23] <jmer> please be sure to understand CASCADE DELETE before applying it in production ;)
[16:49:42] <jmer> ravindUwU: put in other terms, if you have an order with orderlines, deleting the ordertlines when deleting the order will probably make sense for most businesses
[16:49:58] <ravindUwU> right? and the FK from order to lines will have ON DELETE CASCADE yeah?
[16:50:15] <ravindUwU> oh shoot
[16:50:25] <ravindUwU> rather, the order way around
[16:50:43] <ravindUwU> jmer, thanks I need to read more about this; EF defaults to cascading deletes.
[16:51:07] <jmer> I am not sure EF defaults to cascading deletes. At least that would be a very odd choice
[16:51:36] <jmer> but hey... I haven't used EF that much xD
[16:51:49] <jmer> Also is it EF6 or EF Core
[16:51:52] <ravindUwU> core
[16:54:08] <jmer> I would consult this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/saving/cascade-delete from my brief skim it seems EF can handle cascade deletes by it self or let the DB do it...

[17:42:06] <sysRPL> well good trikes are usually expensive by themselves
[17:42:10] <jmer> My wife looked into buying one used and I checked a new battery and it was something like 50-60% of the price of a new bike

[20:20:12] <canton7> Lukky, custom attributes are just bits of data attached to things, which you can retrieve at runtime

[20:50:34] <jonp> you can have as many public types in a file as you want
[20:50:39] <jonp> as many *namespaces* in a file as you want
[20:50:50] <jonp> your entire program can be in a single file, should you wish
[20:51:10] <jkqerigh> But don't I still have to make a class even if its just a single file?
[20:51:27] <jonp> with C#10, you don't need to have a class

[20:52:31] <jonp> Lukky: it's a fucking PITA
[20:52:58] <Lukky> don't we love that ;-)
[20:53:03] <jonp> if you avoid corner cases, the Java approach is "fine"
[20:53:11] <jonp> but if you encounter any corner cases, shit gets wierd
[20:53:20] <jonp> "what kind of corner cases?", you ask?
[20:53:41] <jonp> ~16 years ago I had to maintain a Java app that ran on Classic Mac OS.  (Yes.  Really.)
[20:53:43] <Lukky> I've never really done any serious Java... I just never felt "at home"...
[20:53:50] <jonp> max filename length on Classic Mac is ~32 characters.
[20:54:01] <jonp> so if I had a public Java class with a name exceeding 32 characters…
[20:54:04] <jonp> NO YOU DO NOT.
[20:54:05] <Lukky> wow...
[20:54:07] <jonp> filesystem limits!
[20:54:32] <jonp> or if you try to use non-ASCII characters in your class name, 'cause why not?
[20:54:41] <jonp> now you need to worry about unicode normalization at the filesystem level
[20:54:58] <jonp> it's a fucking STUPID decision by Java to require that shit
[20:55:35] <Lukky> What really put me off is the "mentality" impregnating the Java ecosystem where everything has multiple levels of abraction, even the simplest use-case... AbstractFactoryFactory... *sigh*
[20:55:47] <brianonymous> i got bit in the ass just recently with something related. my lack of use of Path.Combine

[20:57:28] <jonp> it's not that it's a "fan" or not
[20:57:35] <jonp> it's that `\` is a perfectly valid filename character on Linux
[20:57:36] <jkqerigh> Just use / for everything, including windows.
[20:57:44] <jonp> you want `/foo/bar/baz\qux.txt`?  you got it!
[20:58:00] <jonp> `Path.GetFileName()` returns `baz\qux.txt`!
[20:58:17] <brianonymous> yeah, at the time it didnt even cross my mind... until i dockerized it
[20:58:19] <jkqerigh> I tried to compile a program that had no class of any kind in it, just a single file. And got error CS1671: A namespace declaration cannot have modifiers or attributes.

[21:32:41] <brianonymous> thats interesting
[21:32:55] <brianonymous> never thought about something like that
[21:33:36] <jonp> possibly not half as interesting as why i have that in the first place: https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/pull/936/files#diff-4fc0ff1e8e87e8c6c34cf01b03ed8689c7ba247e22b65340ecc3c3fd3ade8656R106
[21:33:53] <jonp> value tuples are also nice

[21:36:22] <brianonymous> is that kind of like an Invoke mapping?
[21:36:38] <brianonymous> looks like fun
[21:36:40] <jonp> maybe?
[21:36:52] <jonp> on both counts?
[21:36:57] <brianonymous> lol

[23:02:45] <BSaboia[m]> jonp, this PR seems uncanny
[23:02:58] <jonp> how so?
[23:06:53] <jonp> i think i've referenced this PR earlier…
[23:08:08] <BSaboia[m]> jonp: I think it's just the amount of things going on for me. Xamarin, Java... too far away from my usual context

[23:55:19] <lz_> there should be a website that references the worst git repositories in terms of python shit dependencies
[23:55:26] <lz_> a hall of shame
[23:55:51] <MatthiasVance> Hall of snakes
[23:55:55] <lz_> or even a kind of meta score that lets you know you're about to lose a day of trying to get it to work
