[02:59:21] <TimMc> Does that mean she only gets an answer like "you're having your period" but doesn't get a real explanation?
[02:59:34] <romare> kinda
[02:59:42] <romare> it's a synopsis so it's a bit mysterious
[03:00:56] <inhahe_> the cycle is the stages a woman goes through every month regarding periods
[03:01:07] <inhahe_> i guess she was told which stage she's in
[03:04:28] <TimMc> inhahe_: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[03:04:58] <romare> it takes place in a remote village in the middle east and she's been told that it's time to get married shortly after she tells her mother that she's menstruating

[03:08:40] <TimMc> Rough.
[03:08:50] <romare> indeed
[03:09:09] <romare> they're naming the film "The Cycle"
[03:09:14] <romare> or should it be just "Cycle"?
[03:09:52] <romare> I'm helping them translate it into english
[03:10:07] <TimMc> ah, neat
[03:10:36] <inhahe_> i'd say The Cycle
[03:10:37] <TimMc> "The Cycle" sounds fine. "Cycle" might be OK but I guess might have a different feel?
[03:11:29] <TimMc> It has been fashionable in the past 5? 10? years to name things with a single word, often short, with no qualifiers or articles.
[03:12:01] <TimMc> but often that is used for things that are supposed to be... I don't know, maybe edgy? mysterious? fashionable?
[03:12:56] <TimMc> So if you told me those two names and nothing else, I would be marginally more likely to guess that "Cycle" was a science fiction title.
[03:13:16] <TimMc> it could also be a fancy restaurant name

[03:19:17] <Jong> Anyone know of any good strategies for becoming good with words? I don't think I am because often I can't even define things that I know. For example, what is a cup? A cop is an object you can hold with your hands that is solid on all sides but the top. There is no top. It's hollow at the top and the surface drops down near the bottom, like the opening of a volcane. Some cups have handles. These are called mugs.  Cups can be made from materials
[03:19:17] <Jong>  of all sorts like plastic, glass, and porcelain.  
[03:21:20] <twb> I sometimes call them "Vespuccini" to troll them
[03:22:06] <Jong> What is a meeting? A meeting is an event that occurs when two or more people meet and have a discussion. Meetings usually are about one or more topics such as how to accomplish a task, who will do what, what is everyone doing today, what has everyone done yesterday, or how to solve a problem.   
[03:22:07] <Jong> Vespuccini ?
[03:22:10] <romare> thanks a lot, TimMc
[03:24:39] <Jong> Hello twb. You're one of handful of generous people who answer people's questions here. Thank you.  I'm wondering, is there any english passages you have memorizes?  The only english passage I have memorized is the US pledge of allegiance. I can't think of anything else I have memorized.
[03:25:05] <twb> blkshp: and yes, Ameslan and British Sign Language are entirely different, like germanic vs. romance languages.  Ameslan is derived from LSF.  Most other English Sign Languages follow the British style.
[03:25:37] <twb> Jong: Amerigo Vespucci was a cartographer
[03:26:17] <twb> There is speculation (or maybe just folk etymology) that "America" is derived from his name, although it would be far more common and logical to use his family name.
[03:26:24] <Jong> twb  that's right! The name America comes from him I think
[03:26:46] <twb> Thus, if America was called "Vespucci", the demonym would be "Vespuccini"
[03:27:05] <Jong> Who would have thought that being a cartographer would be a good strategy to get your name in the history books
[03:27:23] <twb> Jong: well uh... most of them?
[03:28:33] <Jong> not me. I would've thought to become a famous inventor, or start a multinational business and become a philanthropist, or become the leader of a country. But cartographer? I wouldn't have thought of that

[04:56:05] <twb> I think the distinction is about whether it has to insulate
[04:56:16] <twb> a mug is insulative; a cup isn't
[04:56:53] <twb> But the terms are at least partially interchangable
[04:57:21] <Alagolafre> I think the difference is purely social. All mugs have handles and most cups do not, though that does not apply to a "tea-cup".

[07:45:54] <TimMc> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_cow_(idiom) Wikipedia says: «  figurative sacred cow is a figure of speech for something considered immune from question or criticism, especially unreasonably so. »

[07:50:49] <|smlckz|> hmm..
[07:57:20] <twb> "sacred cow" is an idiomatic expression
[07:57:35] <twb> It means something that cannot be challenged

[08:00:57] <white2> *onfuse

[08:02:08] <twb> white2: but it should at least be internally consistent
[08:02:13] <|smlckz|> twb: it is a machine translation from this: ''Dennoch wirkt Putins Krieg gegen die Ukraine für die EU wie ein Lebenselixier, rechts und links werden heilige Kühe geschlachtet und ein neuer Wind weht durch Europa.''
[08:02:38] <TimMc> twb: Not having seen the source and context, my best guess is that it has to do with how politics are quickly changing in the EU right now.
[08:03:16] <TimMc> Someone elsewhere said "wow, the EU is very quickly developing a foreign policy"
[08:03:20] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_of_Change_%28speech%29  possibly
[08:03:26] <twb> for the other bit
[08:03:41] <white2> twb, it does take the assumption that sacred cow is bad for organizations
[08:03:44] <twb> I mean... the EU already had a foreign policy
[08:04:06] <twb> white2: the term "sacred cow" is implicitly about a bad thing
[08:04:20] <twb> Something standing in the way of progress
[08:04:28] <TimMc> Yeah, I have no idea about the actual politics. I don't follow EU stuff all that closely.
[08:04:40] <TimMc> just something that sounded similar
[08:04:41] <twb> like a cow standing on a railway track, and the train driver is not allowed to push it out of the way, so everyone just has to wait
[08:04:58] <white2> twb, then defeating bad = be good for life
[08:05:14] <twb> white2: that's a bit of a stretch
[08:05:32] <twb> I think the original speaker is just dropping a bunch of idiomatic phrases from politics and hoping they mean something
[08:05:46] <white2> this is just a propaganda 
[08:08:03] <twb> "people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny."

[08:09:50] <twb> Ah the sense in English is a little different
[08:10:13] <twb> in English it is a kind of immortality potion --- or sometimes just "a thing you need to stay alive", i.e. water
[08:11:12] <white2> |smlckz|, by the way, I would be happy to know if a paragraph is from AI translation
[08:11:23] <twb> white2: they said so
[08:11:53] <|smlckz|> white2: yes
[08:13:49] <|smlckz|> deepl makes it look a little better: ''Nevertheless, Putin's war against Ukraine is like a lifeblood for the EU, sacred cows are being slaughtered right and left, and a new wind is blowing through Europe.''
[08:14:16] <twb> TimMc: personally the context seems to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_state#Europe  --- westernization/democratization in Eastern Europe being perceived as an existential threat to FSR and its regional dominance / sphere of influence
[08:14:27] <white2> twb, yes, elixir = super potion/medicine 
[08:15:26] <twb> Oops it's SFSR -> FR, not FSR
[08:18:51] <twb> Also don't forget that ua leadership were shady pro-russian dudes until zelensky's satirical comedy about them.  Right after that, he got elected as the *real* president, and right after that, Russia got cranky and did a Crimea in the Crimea

[08:54:45] <twb> Whereas for most other people, they don't ALREADY use an alphabet with simple letterforms

[09:23:58] <furrykef> It honestly kind of mystifies me that humans invented logographies before alphabets
[09:26:37] <furrykef> I understand why proto-writing used pictographs, since it usually concerned objects that were easy to draw.

[09:53:23] <amigojapan> twb: a thrid reason for resistaance to spelling reform is cause often we only know the difference betwen one word and another only because of the difference in spelling like "no" and "know"
[09:54:00] <twb> amigojapan: that only affects the relatively small set of words that have homophones

[10:03:15] <furrykef> I've never bought the homophone argument, because we can distinguish homophones in speech
[10:04:08] <furrykef> To argue that homophones will render a document nonsensical is to say it cannot be read aloud

[12:12:05] <twb> What
[12:12:15] <twb> There is no central authority for Spanish, either
[12:12:25] <amigojapan> furrykef:if one county does it, it will likely end up like simplified kanji, splitting up things that would otherwise be understood as is
[12:12:27] <furrykef> Yes there is. The Real Academia Española
[12:12:34] <twb> furrykef: that's only for Iberian Spanish
[12:12:51] <amigojapan> twb the royal academy of the spanish language
[12:13:09] <twb> Other countries have their own academies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Spanish_Language_Academies
[12:13:10] <furrykef> The RAE is nominally for all varieties of Spanish, though in practice their edicts are sometimes ignored in Latin America
[12:13:58] <twb> I expect I can find an English regulator that is ignored, too
[12:14:35] <amigojapan> hong kong and taiwan did not adopt simplified hanzi
[12:15:05] <amigojapan> simplified hanzi is probably one of the dummbest ideas ever
[12:16:04] <furrykef> I wouldn't say it was a dumb idea, but the results are certainly not ideal
[12:16:55] <twb> The result being that now Chinese farmers can read?
[12:17:13] <twb> sound 2 simplification, I fully admit, was dumb
[12:17:29] <furrykef> I'm not sure the simplification has had much effect on the literacy rate
[12:17:58] <furrykef> Certainly China's literacy is much greater now than it was at the time the reform was introduced, but there are many other factors at play

[12:18:37] <twb> AFAIK it was fundamentally a literacy campaign
[12:18:50] <twb> I'm not sure what else you'd judge it on
[12:19:10] <twb> I mean... the KMT was already fucking mad at CPC
[12:19:31] <twb> They wouldn't care about literacy because "fuck the poor; we're nobles" was pretty much their core policy
[12:19:52] <amigojapan> twb: simplified hanzi is not that much more simple that farmers can read, it fails all around
[12:22:41] <furrykef> "The literacy rate among Taiwanese ages 15 and above was 98.5 percent as of 2014."
[12:23:13] <furrykef> That's a pretty damn good literacy rate, in a country that was run for a long time by the KMT and which doesn't use Simplified characters :P

[13:02:41] <marshmallow> I ask this, because I see many italians starting sentences with 'but still'
[13:02:54] <twb> Often starting a sentence with a conjuction like "but" or "and" is discouraged in formal writing because it suggests you haven't thought out your argument properly
[13:03:02] <marshmallow> in italian it would be completely redundant, but maybe in english it's not
