[13:10:31] <bagder> dege: in other news: what is the use case that drove your work on adding support for NSS in postgres?
[13:10:53] <bagder> it seems nss is mostly otherwise going out of fashion
[13:11:30] <dege> federal installations don't like OpenSSL, they like NSS (because it's very stable) and they really like FIPS, and the OpenSSL story around FIPS is shaky at best
[13:12:02] <bagder> yeah, the fips angle turns out to push lots of openssl people in the wolfssl direction as well
[13:12:34] <dege> I can imagine that being a good driver for business for you
[13:13:14] <bagder> yeah, and now there's this new -3 fips thing
[13:13:32] <bagder> 140-3 I think, which replaces the -2
[13:13:51] <dege> but NSS is apparently pretty much in style within federal in the US

[14:34:50] <hyper_ch> is there a linux cli -> windows cmd curl command transformer?
[14:38:27] <icing> that sounds illegal.
[14:38:59] <hyper_ch> well, windows cli now also has curl available
[14:39:08] <hyper_ch> but I can't just copy and paste the linux command
[14:39:47] <hyper_ch> curl -H "content-type: application/json" -H "X-Api-Key: xxx" -X GET https://api.clockify.me/api/v1/user   -->  curl: (7) Failed to connect to api.clockify.me port 443: Bad access --> while the same command works fine on linux

[17:14:25] <bagder> #7954
[17:14:33] -curelbot- [GitHub] Unknown Entity #7954: Some questions on CURLOPT_ALTSVC (https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/7954)
[17:14:33] <bagder> someone is actually trying out alt-svc!
[17:17:45] <hans> dang, that's the first time i've heard of the Alt-Svc thing at all.. are they referring to the Alt-Srv http header? 
[17:17:55] <hans> Svc*
[17:18:06] <hans> and.. does that thing work with wget?
[17:18:12] <hans> dang, does it work with curl?
[17:18:30] <bagder> this header controls how a client upgrades (or can upgrade) to HTTP/3
[17:18:49] <hans> oh.. so nothing to do with this header then? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc
[17:18:53] <hans> >The Alt-Svc HTTP header allows a server to indicate that a particular resource should be loaded from a different server — while still appearing to the user as if were loaded from the same server.
[17:19:00] <bagder> that's the one
[17:19:08] <bagder> curl --alt-svc ...
[17:20:53] <hans> oh oki. how about A.com just saying >>>"Alt-Svc: h2="B.com:443", h2=":443"<<<
[17:21:04] <hans> will curl then make a new request to B.com ?
[17:21:33] <bagder> yes
[17:21:49] <hans> neat. does that work with wget too?
[17:22:06] <bagder> I doubt it, but I have no idea
[17:23:24] <hans> come to think of it, curl requires --location to follow Location redirects, but curl follows Alt-Svc redirects by default? 
[17:23:54] <bagder> Alt-Svc is not a redirect, and no it doesn't
[17:24:35] <bagder> you need to ask for alt-svc treatment
[17:24:41] <bagder> curl --alt-svc ...
[17:24:49] <hans> ohh got it
[17:27:44] <bagder> since h3 cannot be "upgraded to", that's the only real way a server can ask a client to speak h3 going forward
[17:28:01] <bagder> well, except for the also in-progress new DNS RR records
[17:28:57] <bagder> (but curl has no support for the HTTPS DNS records that serve that purpose)
