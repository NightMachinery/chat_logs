[03:19:26] <jnaleg> What is the most secure and stable distro you can put on a raspberry pi 4? Fedora 34 ARM runs into a kernel memory error upon boot. I want to avoid Raspbian, as I read it is not following best practices for security
[03:19:58] <mlu> jnaleg: you need to evaluate security for yourself
[03:19:58] <clarity> Don't know about most this and that, but Alpine seemed pretty nice when I tried it
[03:20:19] <mlu> that said, I like Alpine and FreeBSD (although I wouldn't call the latter "stable")
[03:20:51] <mlu> as for security: what are you planning to do with the Raspberry Pi? not up to best practices doesn't necessarily mean insecure
[03:20:55] <jnaleg> clarity, Did you try it on raspberry PI?
[03:20:59] <clarity> Yep
[03:21:21] <jnaleg> mlu, So you would consider Alpine more stable on raspberry pi compared to FreeBSD?
[03:21:31] <mlu> jnaleg: it's more tested
[03:21:33] <jnaleg> mlu, Using it as a serial jump host
[03:21:41] <mlu> hard to say if it's necessarily more stable
[03:21:45] <uwharrie> if you're expecting a linux distribution, then freebsd isn't it
[03:22:03] <mlu> jnaleg: yeah, that should be a good use case, but I don't see what's wrong with Raspbian for that :)

[03:23:25] <mlu> jnaleg: lots of tradeoffs here, but I"ll say: OpenBSD is likely very unstable on the Pi
[03:23:50] <mlu> jnaleg: your best bet would be Alpine: it's a security-focused distro, very minimal, and it'll do what you need it to do
[03:23:59] <uwharrie> I'm running OpenBSD snapshots on one and haven't had a kernel panic since the 6.7 days
[03:24:43] <uwharrie> and that was likely triggered by a shoddy USB drive enclosure
[03:24:53] <phogg> Openbsd would be my bsd of choice for fun or security, but freebsd is a bit more practical. A bigger community helps.
[03:25:04] <jnaleg> mlu, I think raspbians' repository is not well deployed. Also it does not ship apparmor/SELinux by default. I think there were some more points when I read up on it
[03:25:15] <phogg> uwharrie: remember when you could panic freebsd by inserting any flash drive?
[03:25:16] <jnaleg> mlu, Thanks i will try alpine :-)
[03:25:20] <phogg> good times!
[03:25:20] <uwharrie> do you need apparmor/selinux?

[06:09:53] <FiReSTaRT> Hi everyone.. So I am trying to move my /home partition (that is taking up an entire drive, nothing else on it) from one drive to another... In the process of copying the contents of /home. Now, let's say my fstab entry for the new /home is:
[06:09:53] <FiReSTaRT> And the one for the old /home is:
[06:09:53] <FiReSTaRT> UUID=whatever-the-uuid-is /new           ext4    defaults        0       2
[06:09:54] <FiReSTaRT> That should mount the new drive as /home and leave the data on the old drive untouched in /new (in case there's some issue with copying the data to the new drive, I can just change 'new' to 'home' and have my old /home back)
[06:09:59] *** Joins: morifi (~morifi@097-099-103-230.res.spectrum.com)
[06:10:16] <phogg> FiReSTaRT: you forgot to escape the / at the start of your 2nd line, so we didn't see it
[06:10:29] <FiReSTaRT> here it is /dev/mapper/homegrp-home /home		ext4    defaults        0       2
[06:11:04] <phogg> FiReSTaRT: it all makes sense except you just described the old drive as being at /new and the new one at /home. Sounds backwards
[06:11:43] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[06:11:43] <phogg> FiReSTaRT: also, I am still waiting for the question
[06:11:53] <FiReSTaRT> phogg that's fine.. just needed a random word to name the mountpoint.. as long as the data on is is untouched and i can reverse the changes in fstab to mount it as /home, that's all I need
[06:12:23] <FiReSTaRT> basically i don't want to erase the data in the old '/home' until i make sure the new '/home' works
[06:12:33] <phogg> in this kind of scenario I will generally create two fstab entries for /home, one for the new drive and one for the old. I will temporarily mount the new drive under some temp location e.g. /mnt/new, and I will do it by hand. When the time comes to swap I will umount /home, edit fstab, and mount /home
[06:13:10] <phogg> I should clarify: at first fstab has the old /home mount uncommented and the new one commented, then after the edit this is reversed
[06:13:10] *** Joins: arthur_melo (~IRC@user/arthur-melo/x-6822691)
[06:13:56] <FiReSTaRT> ok.. but my setup the way it is makes sense? in case something goes sideways i can just boot in with a live usb, change the entry and the old /home will be back?
[06:13:58] <phogg> another option would be to mount the new drive at e.g. /mnt/new, copy all to it, then bind mount it over top of /home, then edit fstab so it gets mounted there on boot. Until the next reboot it's just like you only have the new drive, but the old one is behind it if you umount
[06:14:08] <phogg> after the reboot the old one is not mounted anywhere

[07:01:43] <midnite> Hi, I'm a little confused about how to use a vnc viewer to connect to a VM on another host on my local network. How do I go "inside" the host to the VM running on it? I'm guessing the VM has an IP address somewhere, and finding that IP address should be my first step?

[07:02:36] <midnite> Using Cockpit, I can view the VM and interact with it. Cockpit says it's using VNC
[07:02:53] <midnite> So I know that *somewhere* there is a VNC connection happening, a VNC server and client running... at least, that's what I assume.

[07:04:22] <[[R]]> midnite: your vm needs to be bridged to the host network, and then just install a vnc server in it and go to town just like it wasn't a vm
[07:05:27] <midnite> [[R]]: okay, that makes sense. I created the VM using Cockpit, and it does have a connection to the internet, so I assume it's bridged to the host, but which command(s) can I use to investigae this further, besides "ip"?
[07:05:41] <[[R]]> dont assume anything
[07:05:47] <[[R]]> well yeah, yo ucan start with ip
[07:05:50] <[[R]]> does it have an ip on your real network
[07:05:51] <midnite> I see a network called vibr0, which I assume is virtual bridge zero
[07:05:52] <[[R]]> or a private range?
[07:06:06] <FiReSTaRT> phogg well it kinda worked but i messed up on copying the encrypted home partition.. did a copy of both encrypted and unencrypted lol at least moving the comment in fstab made brought it back to normal.. once i figure out how to do a graceful move of /home, i'll be good to go

[17:04:58] <jnaleg> Hi, do you recommend to use nftables directly or firewalld as wrapper which uses nftables as backend? I read nftables is already much easier to write than iptables, so I am not sure if firewalld is worth it
[17:05:08] <mlu> joo: yes, for the PKI part at least
[17:05:40] <mlu> joo: I would recommend something based on ECC for speed though

[20:36:13] <Urk> I am experiencing a fair amount of compatibility problems with various display managers, and xfce4.  Until recently everything worked fine until a failed attempted upgrade to debian kernel 5.10  I tried to downgrade, by using Timeshift/rsync to kernel 4.19, but the display problems continued.  I ran various debuggers with LightDM who shows a bunch
[20:36:13] <Urk> of error messages, and finally I decided to abandon ship and get a different display manager.  I installed sddm, and it works perfectly with LXDE, but not XFCE.  I tried LXDM, but it had the same hanging problem with XFCE4 so I am wondering if I might benefit by downgrading my XFCE4* to an earlier version of XFCE4?  Not sure how to do this, and no

[21:40:56] <theos> akk does it auto-calculate the margin or do i have to specify? because pages have different sized margins
[21:41:15] <akk> theos: That page explains it: it removes border pixels that are the same color as the corners.
[21:41:41] <theos> akk my bad. should have read it first. thanks a lot
[21:41:47] <akk> theos: Has to be exactly the same, though, so if it's a scanned photo you might need to process it a little first.
[21:42:05] <theos> i must say, imagemagick is amazing. has saved me a lot of trouble already
[21:42:12] <alkisg> iomari891: does xterm work at that point?

[21:42:48] <theos> yes i processed it a bit with imagemagick. turned it grayscale and adjusted brightness and contrast. so its just black pixels and white pixels

[23:56:03] <ayecee> theos: if i'm not mistaken, it may be due to image size. this suggests that imagemagick policy is often configured to choke on 10k+ pixel images. https://askubuntu.com/a/1181773
[23:56:12] <omero> Gustavo6046: remind me to ask more questions.
[23:56:16] <ayecee> theos: i don't know why that would work for multiple images though.
[23:56:18] <Gustavo6046> here's that single datagram I captured wearlier and pcapped https://termbin.com/2l99
[23:56:35] <Gustavo6046> I reran the command because I forgot to go to /root instead of my home folder lol

[23:56:40] <Gustavo6046> imagine having root-owned files in your home directory
[23:56:43] <Gustavo6046> omero: hm? why?
[23:56:46] <Gustavo6046> is something wrong?

[23:57:13] <ayecee> theos: are there any other lines from convert? in the post there's also a further note above that  with "attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy"
[23:57:17] <omero> no, thats kind of ... normal behaviour.

[23:57:31] <theos> ayecee i tried changing the size limit in policy file but it didnt work. but it works for multiple images till it runs out of cache

[23:57:42] <omero> we still want to identify the device that is causing this, Gustavo6046
[23:57:50] <ayecee> what happens when it runs out of cache?
[23:57:51] <omero> it seems it appears/disappears.
[23:57:59] <Gustavo6046> Ah
[23:58:11] <Gustavo6046> Nono I mean if something is wrong with having both v4 and v6 on a wireless interface
[23:58:19] <Gustavo6046> also we captured 6 datagrams
[23:58:24] <Gustavo6046> is it really going to get to 256?
[23:58:25] *** Joins: Ducki (~ducki@user/ducki)
[23:58:28] <omero> and this means... its a device that is "trying" to engage/hook with your wifi lan
[23:58:35] <Gustavo6046> 1 v6, 3 v4, 1 ARP, 1 v6
[23:58:37] <Gustavo6046> in that order
[23:58:43] <omero> yes.
[23:59:01] <omero> its a device that its nearby, but its not doing anything serious
[23:59:02] <Gustavo6046> with the lan? you mean that as in as opposed to my device only?
[23:59:07] <omero> just asking things
[23:59:23] <omero> he doesnt do any real traffic
[23:59:39] <theos> ayecee then it starts outputting 0byte files
[23:59:43] <omero> its just requests... harmless requests as far as I can see
