[03:16:45] <MetaNova> it can be improved

[11:42:20] <Pascal91> hi twb 
[11:43:37] <Pascal91> I have a very practical question. I need to mention changes in an article using line numbers. Should I say: "text was modified lines 4-6" or "text was modified in lines 4-6"?
[11:43:54] <twb> the latter
[11:44:01] <twb> possibly "on lines 4-6"
[11:45:15] <Pascal91> this is for a US english reader. Which one sounds better? in or on?
[11:45:26] <mornfall> the lines 4-6 were modified (or have been)
[11:46:07] <twb> I think "on" feels more natural to me
[11:46:16] <twb> but I don't have strong feelings either way
[11:47:15] <Pascal91> humm... passive mode doesn't sounds good mornfall?
[11:47:23] <mdogg> 4-6 does mean lines for through 6.  
[11:48:13] <mdogg> "The text on lines 4 through 6 was modified."  Or, "The text on lines 4 and 6 was modified." (if it's only those two lines)
[11:48:35] <mornfall> Pascal91: how is ‘text was modified’ not passive
[11:48:35] <mdogg> Just my 2 cents..
[11:49:24] <Pascal91> mornfall sorry... I meant my proposition was passive mode :)
[11:49:24] <mdogg> heh - you could say, "The text on lines 4 through 6 has been modified."
[11:49:26] <mornfall> but if you want to make it active, ‘we/I have modified the lines 4-6’ works, of course
[11:50:35] <Pascal91> ok... I think I'm going to use mdogg last proposition

[11:52:07] <Pascal91> thanks to all!
[11:53:10] <mdogg> haaha
[11:53:21] <mornfall> Possibly relevant, in ‘text on lines … was modified’ the ‘text’ refers to the 3 lines, not to the entire document, unlike in the original (‘text was modified …’). But then, quite as possibly irrelevant.
[11:53:42] <twb> Pascal91: "I'm going to use mdogg's last suggestion" --- "proposition" feels a little off there.  "proposal" would be OK.
[11:57:17] <Pascal91> sorry, proposition is just a "francisism"

[13:30:16] <placeb0> plain is no sugar

[13:43:53] <Me-me> "Initially, after passing the computer network course of my BSc in Electrical Engineering, I became very interested in the IT field."

[13:45:06] <Me-me> That said, "I found out intense interesting" is invalid for a couple reasons, and "field" is the term more commonly used to refer to things like IT - you might also use "industry".

[14:56:00] <placeb0> yeah Me-me I realized that in English speaking countries coffee is served hot, so there's no need to request sugar in it as you can add it yourself and so there's no specific word
[14:56:27] <Me-me> People do ask for it, though. Just not with a term like "sweet coffee".

[14:57:00] <placeb0> I assume 'one sugar' is one tsp
[14:57:45] <SkunkyLaptop> placeb0: it's 1 sugar packet
[14:57:48] <Me-me> That varies, I believe.
[14:57:53] <SkunkyLaptop> or 1 sugar cube
[14:58:42] <placeb0> I don't think coffee shops would use packets
[14:58:50] <Me-me> They absolutely can.
[14:58:54] <placeb0> they probably just have a big jar of sugar
[14:59:11] <Me-me> Some have jars, some have packets, some use spoons, I believe I even saw a dispenser once.
[14:59:34] <placeb0> Me-me: that doesn't sound very environmentally friendly or convenient for the person making coffees
[15:00:17] <Me-me> The issue of responsibility vis a vis sugar delivery is, unfortunately, a complicated one.
[15:00:35] <placeb0> where I live they always have just a big jar of white sugar and a big jar of white sugar and use a spoon 
[15:01:03] <placeb0> I said 'white' twice -.-
[15:01:27] <placeb0> the second 'white' was meant to be 'brown' lol

[15:03:46] <placeb0> do you mean other than sugar?
[15:04:18] <pussipupu> I mean probably sugar and other sweeteners, but I drink my coffee unsweetened
[15:05:02] <placeb0> you are going hard :P

[16:02:41] <keepitalphanumer> Hi all. I was reading an article earlier today and I couldn't find the definition of "potemkin version". What does this term mean?
[16:06:49] <keepitalphanumer> I found it: the term "Potemkin" can be used to refer to something apparently impressive but actually sham or artificial:
[16:07:23] <keepitalphanumer> So a potemkin version would be a "impressive but actually sham or artificial" version of something.
[16:07:52] <pabed1> mornfall: " how can they ensure " or  "how they can ensure" the sentence is not questions?
[16:09:38] <keepitalphanumer> The "How can they ensure" is a question. "How they can ensure" may refer to the way they can ensure somethig (proof is "how they can ensure" that the statement is true)
[16:10:14] <keepitalphanumer> "How can they ensure" that the statement is true?
[16:10:18] <keepitalphanumer> This is a question
[16:11:20] <mornfall> keepitalphanumer: the context is ‘they need to know how (they can|can they) ensure’

[16:16:40] <keepitalphanumer> In this situation, you are not making a question. So you should use the "they can" ... When you ask questions you have to invert (How can they... ? )

[16:17:40] <keepitalphanumer> I asked about your native language because in some laguages the order matters and in others it don't... In Farsi, do you need to do this inversions?

[21:17:29] <mdogg> THere's some good info on Wikipedia that I snagged and shortened:  
[21:17:30] <mdogg> A Potemkin village, in politics and economics, is any construction (literal or figurative) whose sole purpose is to provide an external façade to a country that is faring poorly, making people believe that the country is faring better.  The term comes from stories of a fake portable village built by Grigory Potemkin, solely to impress the Empress during her journey to Crimea in 1787.

[21:18:27] <mdogg> Also, "Potemkin village" is a phrase that has been used by American judges, especially members of a multiple-judge panel who dissent from the majority's opinion on a particular matter, to refer to an inaccurate or tortured interpretation and/or application of a particular legal doctrine to the specific facts at issue.  Use of the phrase is meant to imply that the reasons espoused by the panel's majority in support of its decision are not based on accurate or 
[21:18:27] <mdogg> sound law, and their restrictive application is merely a masquerade for the court's desire to avoid a difficult decision.
[21:19:36] <mdogg> It's a pretty cool term, actually.  And I didn't realize the city of Detroit went about doing that for the Super Bowl.. heh

[23:11:12] <TimMc> blkshp: Jeans or other pants that only go down to the thigh or at most just below the knee.
[23:11:36] <blkshp> cool!
[23:11:43] <blkshp> thanks
[23:11:55] <TimMc> Now, "pants", that's one to watch out for if I recall correctly...
[23:12:24] <blkshp> Yes, that one we know of. I just seem to remember something American from back in the day referring to shorts like boxer shorts
[23:12:32] <blkshp> Maybe I just misremeber
[23:13:16] <TimMc> boxer shorts are the pants of underwear
[23:13:52] <TimMc> ^ a phrase that will not make any sense in the UK
[23:14:00] <blkshp> It does
[23:14:41] <TimMc> Doesn't "pants" mean underwear for you?
[23:15:09] <blkshp> Yes but the pants of underwear could be because they are the ones with the legs
[23:17:34] <TimMc> aha :-)

[23:37:40] <TimMc> blkshp: Are "trousers" a broad category that includes jeans, formalwear, etc?
[23:38:58] <blkshp> It's difficult to say really, I'd say yes, but  usually if referring to 'jeans' or 'trackies' you'd use those words.
[23:40:01] <blkshp> But saying "I'll put trousers on today instead of shorts" can refer to any long leg clothing!
[23:40:10] <blkshp> Would you say 'pants' to refer to jeans?
