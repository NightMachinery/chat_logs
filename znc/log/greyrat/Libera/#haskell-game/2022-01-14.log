[23:00:00] <sm> ic.rbow: it's better. The same noticeable ~10s delay on first visit, but fast after that, and no style popping after a second. I haven't seen any pages with images though.
[23:21:44] <icrbow[m]> 10s ðŸ˜°
[23:34:21] <ManofLetters[m]> 10s after 1min warmup after 1h pre-caching, but then it's extremely fast
[23:36:19] <icrbow[m]> + 1d fiddling with GPU drivers
