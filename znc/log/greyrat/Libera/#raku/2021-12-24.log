[02:54:12] <[Coke]> "if it works" - you ran the test, right?
[02:54:37] <[Coke]> you can use TEST_FILES env var or pass in file names as a command line arg to an individual test.
[02:54:53] <[Coke]> It fails.
[02:55:39] <[Coke]> I'll let you revert or fix it; but you can run the test without me. "make xtest" does every test every file. if you have a local change, you can do 'TEST_FILES=doc/Language/classtut.pod6 make xtest' e.g.

[15:46:51] <tellable6> 2021-12-24T02:31:08Z #raku <[Coke]> tbrowder ok, I'll re-revert. Please run tests before pushing in future.
[15:47:47] <tbrowder> if so, you’ll have to shun me…
[15:52:43] <Altai-man> tbrowder, was there a recent drama I'm not aware of or how so?
[15:53:59] <Altai-man> AFAIK the rule of the thumb is still in terms of "be nice to people" here, not sure if it changed.
[15:55:11] <tbrowder> some ppl giving views on abortion and how it affects going to certain parts of the country
[15:58:56] <Altai-man> it's their right to give those, I think it's also yours to give yours. whether you go quarrelling about this it's another, but arguably falls under the "be nice" thing. and if people decide to quarrel over politics more, then it's already an offtopic, and an unpleasant ones.

[16:08:59] <lizmat> tbrowder: fwiw, I won't be going there either, and the reasoning [Coke] gave is only one of them
[16:10:04] <lizmat> tbrowder: the bathroom laws in TX just make me feel insecure, and having friends in TX being told *at gunpoint* to take the wrong toilet or go away, doesn't help
[16:11:27] <lizmat> Houston and Austin may be ok, fact is, they *are* part of TX

[16:37:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yes thanks for sharing stories and opinions. I got a job in Huston 10 years ago, and during the interview I asked the HR are we allowed to bring guns at work. She said until recently the rule of the company was "no guns at work", but they found out that is against the law in Texas; so when I asked the answer was "yes."

[16:41:48] <lizmat> I agree that people can be evil, and I'd say very few of us are without any evil within us somewhere
[16:42:07] <ggoebel_> fwiw everything is political... IMHO, the best we can do is try to leave unrelated politics at the door
[16:42:08] <El_Che> I am an asshole, hence don't give me a gun
[16:42:34] <lizmat> making it easier to get a gun than to get a driver's license, feels wrong to me

[16:44:25] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: sorry, but it's too late for this year's advent
[16:44:33] <lizmat> the final post is already scheduled
[16:45:14] <lizmat> and I don't have much time atm to look at it now, but a quick glance tells me the article / blog post could well stand on its own without being part of the advent cycle :-)
[16:45:18] <ggoebel_> boxing day post? extra presents are nice

[16:46:03] <tbrowder> and it looks very interesting!
[16:46:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > guns are not evil, ppl are
[16:47:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this sounds nice in theory, the problem is, the consequences of "being evil" matter
[16:47:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if you gave me a gun in my worst mood, I might just shoot someone
[16:47:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> when otherwise I would be pretty harmless
[16:47:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the problem with guns is that it makes causing the most possible harm look and feel harmless
