[00:03:42] <MacGyver> I honestly don't "get" tvs anymore.
[00:04:16] <MacGyver> Like most people getting a smart tv, wouldn't they be *much* happier with an equally sized dumb screen hooked up to a PC, or heck, playstation or whatever?
[00:04:55] <thurstylark> ooh, I have the answer for that one: convenience
[00:05:06] <thurstylark> that's like, it, though
[00:05:07] <MacGyver> But is it?

[00:05:28] <MacGyver> I don't find navigation using those remotes convenient in the slightest.
[00:05:29] <BrainDamage> they want content pushed down to them
[00:05:35] <denisse> Having 1 remote control for the TV is convenient, yeah.
[00:05:42] <Antiz> Well... it is for some specific things
[00:05:45] <BrainDamage> and 10ft ui
[00:05:50] <thurstylark> yeah, it's the integration 
[00:06:01] <BrainDamage> a computer still requires setup
[00:06:10] <BrainDamage> that's one step too much for most
[00:06:12] <Antiz> In my own experience, I have a TV, but no TV channel or anything
[00:07:02] <thurstylark> thousands of dollars have been spent in the pursuit of a fully integrated A/V system, and not one I've come in contact with does the job as well as a smart tv [from the user's perspective]
[00:07:10] * thurstylark has installed many of these systems
[00:07:43] <thurstylark> the UI fuckery is a small price to pay for not having to think too hard about your media delivery infrastructure

[04:04:11] <hakumei> Hi, I have archlinux and ubuntu installed on same laptop and recently I found that in idle state archlinux emits more heat than ubuntu, which causes louder fan noise.

[05:07:35] <jirido> I live in the hope

[14:32:59] <VinnySauce> yeah I'm installing a package written in NodeJS
[14:33:15] <VinnySauce> but this happens more generally even while i'm not installing
[14:33:24] <VinnySauce> when I'm writing to disk, it feels like things are slower than normal
[14:33:39] <Namarrgon> do you have trim configured?
[14:33:52] <Namarrgon> run smartctl on the disk and see if it's out of reserve blocks
[14:35:37] <VinnySauce> ok, just ran SmartCTL
[14:36:22] <VinnySauce> the TRIM command is "Available, deterministic, zeroed"

[14:36:41] <VinnySauce> retired_block_count is 0
[14:37:06] <VinnySauce> I think it's on by default
[14:37:19] <VinnySauce> lsblk --discard shows that it's enabled

[14:39:12] <VinnySauce> it's weird, the fstrim systemd service is loaded but inactive
[14:39:21] <VinnySauce> there's no discard in /etc/fstab
[14:39:38] <Namarrgon> what about the .timer unit?
[14:39:53] <VinnySauce> loaded but inactive (dead)
[14:39:59] <VinnySauce> seems disabled
[14:40:08] <VinnySauce> Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/fstrim.timer; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
[14:40:17] <Namarrgon> so you never ran trim on that fs?
[14:40:28] <VinnySauce> I guess not, ah I see
[14:40:41] <VinnySauce> lsblk indicates TRIM /support/, not whether it's actually being run
[14:40:50] <Namarrgon> trim it manually first, then enable the timer and see if the situation improves

[19:52:43] <noahmg123> I have a WiFi/Bluetooth combo card in my laptop. However, it seemed to fail several months back, so I disabled it in my BIOS and bought dongles to replace the functionality. They work, but I'm wondering if anyone here could possible know a fix. I haven't enabled it in a bit, but iirc it would work for a minute or two before it would literally just stop responding. Reading kernel logs, it would simply timeout during communication.
[19:53:08] <noahmg123> that would crash the driver, and make the card unusable

[21:05:28] <noahmg123> funny story on the model numbers, my previous laptop was an ASUS, and I opened it up and found an unused M.2 slot. so I called Asus to confirm it was that and what capacities it was rated for. guy straight-up told me the slot didn't exist on my chassis model. I gave him the board model number and he found it. So apparently, they have different internal service manuals.

[23:01:35] <heythere221> grazzolini: Okay thanks! Right power consumption is a thing... I gues I have to read more about it. Since I'm on a laptop the battery life is kinda important. Have to see what the difference in consumption will be.

[23:03:30] <grazzolini> heythere221: on a laptop you should use your battery as little as possible. one thing to mention though, some of the newer cards will be on a lower performance level, which makes them consume basically the same amount of energy as if you did power them off via acpi/bbswitch.

[23:42:33] <arbitrandomuser> (when alt and prtsc are pressed)
[23:42:59] <MacGyver> Sounds like it's using a matrix that cannot process those combinations.
[23:43:33] <MacGyver> That, or magic sysrq is enabled and eating the combinations.
[23:43:46] <arbitrandomuser> thats what i thought which is wierd since modern laptops should be able to handle this
