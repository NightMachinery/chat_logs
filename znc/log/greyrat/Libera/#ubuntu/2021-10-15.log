[09:39:03] <TheBigK> whenever i do a release-upgrade i check if all my installed packages have a mirror behind it. i found out that the package libslirp0 in the impish version is considered a downgrade from the one in ubuntu hirsute
[09:39:11] <guiverc> mohnish, you haven't said if desktop or server install; but I'd just perform an 'upgrade via re-install'  (use existing partitions without format) if it's a desktop system; after cleaning out 3rd party sources; and any packages that will create issues for the upgrade... I'd not expect any data restoration to be required - but given it's a well-past EOL (for both) OSes you're asking about we can only offer opinions
[09:40:11] <guiverc> my prior comment ^ assumed desktop install (ie. system dirs being wiped won't lose desktop configs)
[09:40:40] <mohnish> its a desktop install, yes

Using virt-manager/qemu+kvm, when I choose 1920x1080 as screen size in ubuntu guest, and then mximize full screen on my 1920x1080 screen, I notice that the VM screen is blurred. I had to deactivate scaling because in fact, the VM screen is bigger than 1080 by 10ish pixels in fact

[18:49:44] <tomreyn> bancroft: do these actually have such sensors on their boards?
[18:50:13] <tomreyn> but even if so, you'd still need to ensure that there is documentation on how to query those, as well as someone implementing the code to do so.
[18:50:18] <solsTiCe> and guess what ? this only happens with ubuntu 21.10. was fine with 21.04 or any other os in fact

[20:11:29] <tomreyn> mgedmin: lt.archive.ubuntu.com currently points to ftp.litnet.li, which is supposedly up to date according to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+mirror/ftp.litnet.lt-archive  (maybe my guessting based on the trace directory contents was incorrect - better check the package archive list)
[20:12:31] <svm_invictvs> TJ-, Yeah, which is why I tried plugging the keyboard into the 2.x port and it still did that.
[20:13:01] <svm_invictvs> TJ-, I heard people saying you can fix this by forcing some USB modes in the BIOS but I can't find that anywhere.
[20:13:29] <TJ-> svm_invictvs: the main thing I see though is the current system firmware is many versions out of date. it is v1.20 dated Aug 2019 but latest is v3.2 dated Aug 2021 https://asrock.com/MB/AMD/X570%20Phantom%20Gaming-ITXTB3/index.asp#BIOS
[20:13:49] <svm_invictvs> And at this point I'm willing to say it's a minor inconvenience to enter the boot menu to get into Windows.
[20:13:55] <svm_invictvs> TJ-, Yeah. I haven't ever updated the firmware.
[20:13:59] <TJ-> svm_invictvs: "DMI: To Be Filled By O.E.M. To Be Filled By O.E.M./X570 Phantom Gaming-ITX/TB3, BIOS P1.20 08/08/2019"

[20:14:30] <svm_invictvs> Yeah
[20:14:38] <svm_invictvs> I just rebuilt this machine, haha
[20:14:49] <svm_invictvs> I should give the software some love
[20:15:17] <svm_invictvs> I was playing Valheim and streaming. CPU got 96C and the overtemp protection kicked in.
[20:15:18] <TJ-> svm_invictvs: reading the firmware changelogs I suspect the latest firmware may well solve the issue

[22:09:36] <alkisg> TryingToDualBoot: sometimes it can be fixed by regenerating the bcd store, other times by trying to boot enough times, other times it just needs a reinstallation even on top of existing data
