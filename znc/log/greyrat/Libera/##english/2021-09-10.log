[02:55:40] <JustLandedOnMars> Person2: Fink don't need much of a reason
[02:55:46] <JustLandedOnMars> Person1: no, he doesn't
[02:56:13] <JustLandedOnMars> why it says "don't" in second sentence and "doesn't" in 3rd sentence ?
[02:56:26] <JustLandedOnMars> because "don't" is incorect
[03:00:36] <hoglahoo> don’t isn’t standard, but it is clearly understood by native English speakers
[03:00:42] <hoglahoo> I’m not sure, but it might be considered dialectal

[03:15:56] <mdogg> I hear people use "don't" when they should be using "doesn't" all the time, too.  The same people who use "don't" incorrectly (like in your example above) will often use "doesn't" if they were writing the same sentence -- unless they are going for some type of 'effect'.  At least that's what I've noticed.
[03:16:32] <OMGOMG> it's just slang
[03:18:32] <mdogg> A friend of mine uses "don't" incorrectly a lot.  And he will say things like, "The lawn mower has no gas." rather than "The lawn more doesn't have any gas."
[03:18:47] <OMGOMG> that's just efficient
[03:19:05] <mdogg> It's annoys me.
[03:19:49] <mdogg> It's not like he's in a time crunch to relay information about the lawn mower's fuel, though.
[03:21:58] <OMGOMG> would you prefer "The lawn mower don't have no gas"?
[03:22:03] <hoglahoo> :)
[03:22:42] <mdogg> It wouldn't surprise me to hear that.
[03:22:44] <jessicara> "the lawnmower is gassless" sounds wrong somehow
[03:23:20] <hoglahoo> “it ain’t runnin’ no more”
[03:24:37] <jessicara> here sometimes i hear things like "it's no runnin' any more" or things like this
[03:25:09] <jessicara> yes, scotland
[03:28:06] <JustLandedOnMars> "ain't have not gas dat lawn mower b**ch"
[03:28:25] <mdogg> Don't get me wrong - I relax sometimes when speaking with my friends too - I might say "ain't" once in a blue moon if the mood should strike me.  I just don't make a habit of it.  
[03:29:19] *** rber is now known as le
[03:29:21] <mdogg> There will eventually come a time when you want to sound like you have a good grasp of the English language when you're speaking to someone (perhaps about a promotion at work) or something.  If you're in the habit of putting sentences together properly because you do it all the time, then you won't have to think so hard about how you're speaking.
[03:29:29] <jessicara> i seem to take on the speech patterns of people around me
[03:29:40] <jessicara> so the more scottish i talk to the more scottish it gets, including slang
[03:30:56] *** le is now known as rber
[03:31:19] <mdogg> jessicara: Everybody does that to some degree, I think.  When I lived in Memphis I had to really try to speak without a southern accent.  I didn't want to adopt one, but I found that I was starting to develop one.  
[03:32:22] <mdogg> Actually, that's how I learned my own lesson about making a point for myself to not cut corners.  I found myself saying "ain't" and using "don't" incorrectly all the time.  
[03:33:59] <jessicara> yeah, although i have other problems speaking properly this doesn't help
[03:36:48] <hoglahoo> it often helps to pick up nonstandard English to be easily understood or to fit in
[03:39:35] <mdogg> On the other hand, I was flipping through the channels a while back and caught part of this reality show about these loggers from maybe Louisiana or some place down there.  There were about 6 guys speaking with each other and I couldn't understand a single word they were saying.  They were speaking English but the show's producers felt it necessary to provide English subtitles.  If they never need to speak to anybody else then I guess it doesn't matter how it 
[03:39:35] <mdogg> sounds..
[03:42:16] <hoglahoo> Yeah.  I’m no expert, but I think that’s one way languages evolve into different ones
[03:42:48] <mdogg> You're probably right./
[03:44:06] <mdogg> When I hear somebody with a Scottish accent it takes me a few minutes before I start to understand what's going on.. heh
[03:44:25] <mdogg> Eventually the pieces fall into place.

[06:36:39] <Fohsap> any kind of literary terms are useful for a writer.
[06:36:45] <Fohsap> but some more than others

[06:46:41] <jessicara> i don't understand either
[06:46:46] <Samian> What's the reason people make puns related to the subject they're talking about.  Like if a company posts a job ad looking for a tooth whitening scientist, the ad will say "If this sounds like a job you could sink your teeth into, we want to talk to you!"
[06:47:17] <jessicara> if i were more cynical i'd say to disarm you for the suffering of the interview
[06:47:41] <Fohsap> jessicara, do you think o yourself as a person eager to change, a person who sometimes changes sometimes does not and sometimes moves backwards, or as a person who does not like change at all?
[06:47:41] <Samian> lol what kind of suffering are you picturing?
[06:48:08] <Fohsap> Samian, maybe half of language is for entertainment.
[06:48:25] <Samian> jessicara in the lion king when Symba was surrounded by the Hyenas in the elephant graveyard the hyenas got into puns too. "Did we order this meal to go? because there it goes!"
[06:48:33] <Fohsap> and people who cannot enjoy language identify themselves as controversial characters
[06:48:34] <Samian> "make mine a 'cub' sandwich"
[06:49:07] <Samian> Fohsap  I actually find puns weird. I'm like "who said we're playing the pun game?"
[06:49:42] <jessicara> not an easy question
[06:49:43] <Samian> I mean, if people verbally said "let's try to say as many funny puns as we can" and everyone is like "yeah I'm in. let's do it!", then it would make sense
[06:49:44] <Fohsap> so?
[06:50:38] <Fohsap> I took some formal lessons on manners, and the way that they defined "rudeness" is "showing discomfort".
[06:50:58] <Samian> so engaging in pun-ery unsolicitedly is like someone saying "let's play tag, you're it!" without asking if you want to play
[06:51:00] <Fohsap> In that sense, people would find your discomfort around puns weird. :)
[06:51:36] <Fohsap> 'When will the fool stop fooling'... somewhere in psalms
[06:51:56] <Fohsap> Samian, Is it?
[06:52:01] <Fohsap> Tag is a contact sport.
[06:52:03] <Samian> it's ot discomfort. It's annoyance. It's distracting taking focus off of the substance and instead encouraging people to expend brain cycles on pun finding instead of dedicating the entire mind to the substance
[06:52:42] <Fohsap> People think more efficiently when they're in a good mood.
[06:53:23] <Fohsap> Also, people have significantly reduced access to positive memories when in a bad mood.
[06:53:26] <jessicara> not sure about that, i seem to think more efficiently with just the right amount of fear instead
[06:53:39] <jessicara> not too much though, that becomes the opposite
[06:53:54] <Fohsap> And even if that weren't the case, relationships are usually more important than dry facts.
[06:54:17] <Samian> The best way to communicate with a fishy person is to drop them a line.  I'm not fishing. Line dropping isn't for me.
[06:54:33] * jessicara scrunches nose up at that pun
[06:55:19] <Fohsap> anybody want a peanut?
[06:55:34] <Fohsap> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCHKYNFH9Lk
[06:58:33] <Samian> jessicara do you scrunch your nose to everyone you face?

[23:50:47] <blkshp> not
[23:51:00] <AmalLight> or I must use: Interesting recap was offered by?
[23:51:37] <hoglahoo> I’m not sure where the thing you’re asking about ends, and where your question begins xD
[23:51:41] <AmalLight> for example i adopted is not passive, but i was adopted is passive form, right?
[23:51:42] <blkshp> Oh i see
[23:52:01] <blkshp> AmalLight: you're confusing the situation because you can't be bothered.
[23:52:10] <blkshp> It's getting a little tiresome much as i like you.
[23:52:47] <blkshp> for example 'i adopted' is not passive, but 'i was adopted' is passive form, right?
[23:52:57] <blkshp> See what i have done there, please do the same in future.
[23:53:18] <jessicara> is there some resource to understanding what all those tenses are?
[23:53:21] <LuisP18> must be some title/caption
