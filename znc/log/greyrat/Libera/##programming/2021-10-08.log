[06:37:10] <quazimodo> so we have a test suite & we run rspec's bisect tool on it from time to time to find flaky tests, stuff where the order of tests causes failures due to persistent state changes in stuff like db or other services
[06:37:33] <quazimodo> it's pretty good, but that thing & our regular parallelised test suite is definitely 'bogged down' by something we can't put our fingers on
[06:38:03] <quazimodo> the whole thing's in ruby, but i'm thikning maybe there are linux process profiling tools that can be used to monitor the processes & detect what they're spending their time on
[06:38:24] <quazimodo> we had a theory there might be file io issues but seems like there aren't after we mounted ramdisks in place of ssd
[06:38:42] <quazimodo> it's all very open ended - we think /something/ is making stuff slow but not exactly sure what

[06:40:51] <flaknet99>  if only ruby has timestamps
[06:42:07] <Tabmow> I currently have a SPA which interfaces with an API backend written in Java. The application is in AWS and the frontend is Vue.js sitting in cloudfront whilst the Java backend is in ECS. We're looking to extend this to provide a B2B API where external customers can integrate with us directly. Is there a best practice here?
[06:42:08] <Tabmow> Is it best to separate the B2B backend from the backend that our SPA connects to?
[06:44:05] <flaknet99> best practice: follow the spec, don't screw up
[06:45:43] <Tabmow> The spec?
[06:45:56] <flaknet99> B2B API you mention
[06:46:02] <flaknet99> is that not a tangible document?
[06:47:01] <Tabmow> This is something we will be creating, what I'm asking is should we separate it from the backend API our SPA connects to? Should it be 1 in the same? Does it matter?
[06:47:23] <flaknet99> you say its "A b2b API"
[06:47:31] <flaknet99> now it doesn't exist?
[06:48:09] *** Joins: shiva__ (LordShiva@user/one39dev)
[06:48:46] <Tabmow> Correct, so we've delivered our web application with a backend API. Now we also need to deliver B2B functionality as our next feature. So I'm asking more of a design/architectural question if it's best practice to just expand the existing API, or have it totally separate etc.

[09:05:46] <quazimodo> Tabmow: you asked about b2b vs "private" api
[09:06:02] <quazimodo> I think it /really/ depends on your implementation
[09:06:56] <quazimodo> for example a 'hasura' style graphql generator over your DB is absolutely not appropriate for your B2B API unless that DB is wired in such a way as to be a DB for a service that handles B2B, and not one of your core private service
[09:07:24] *** Quits: jazz-o-lantern (~jaziz@172.58.19.25) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[09:07:35] <quazimodo> reason is that once an API is out in the wild it's no fun making changes to it, API generators tend to 'follow' something they can understand such as DB structure so you become a slave to the real owner of the API, the consumer
[09:07:47] <quazimodo> you wont be able to make breaking changes unless your consumers are happy to jump onto new version
[09:08:57] <quazimodo> some implementation libs such as ruby's Grape make it reasonably easy to specify which version of the API the consumer wants to use; you can produce official B2B apis using the same code as the private API but you can override some behaviours for one or the other
[09:09:40] <quazimodo> importantly you probably don't need to use separate urls, `api.yourapp.com` should work for both as long as you intercept the token/cookie/whatever and then route the request to the appropriate api entrypoint
[09:10:26] <quazimodo> that being said, should your private api and your b2b api "be the same api"
[09:10:32] <quazimodo> my opinion, no way
[09:10:50] <quazimodo> API team doesn't own the API, the consumer(s) do

[10:50:17] <mrig> I need to code something at that level perhaps to make it more apparent.
[10:50:39] <vdamewood> Hmm... are you familiar with how dlopen and friends work?
[10:51:24] <mrig> Thinking at the moment about C as I'm coding using systems libs that are also in C or C++, and coming from Go which has difficulty interfacing with C.
[10:51:31] <mrig> no I'm not familar.
[10:52:58] <vdamewood> Okay, so when you call dlopen it loads a .so into memory, but it doesn't integrate the symbol table in that .so into the program's symbol table. To access global values and functions in the .so, there's another function you can call that will return a void pointer to it.
[10:53:51] <vdamewood> Oh, dlsym is the function.
[10:53:55] <mrig> oh yes I have used dlopen now, just not familiar enough yet for it to stick in mind.
[10:54:05] <mrig> got function pointers from it.
[10:54:32] <mrig> on windows though so it was a .dll lib.
[10:55:06] <mrig> This was interacting with C++, the function pointers were a classes methods, which was pretty cool
[10:55:12] <vdamewood> Yep, and it was LoadLibrary on Windows.
[10:55:56] <mrig> oh yes, thats right, I must have the dlopen in mind as the guy has shown what was happening inside.
[10:56:27] <vdamewood> So, what language implementations like Python do is they specify a symbol or two you have to include in your module (.so file). These would include metadate tables or initialization functions for the module.
[10:56:43] <mrig> Is dlopen is a cpu command?
[10:56:50] <mrig> asm
[10:57:23] <vdamewood> Nope. dlopen is a non-standard function.
[10:57:37] <mrig> right, tables that map the API to the target language.

[12:54:26] *** Joins: mdogg (~mdogg@user/mdogg)
[12:55:02] <yanmaani> The way it does this is through the type system: If you do something that requires a lock, you need to hold a lock. You hold a lock if (1) you acquire it in the same piece of code or (2) your function is annotated to be called with a requirement to hold such lock.
[12:55:14] *** Parts: mdogg (~mdogg@user/mdogg) (Leaveing . . .)
[12:55:17] <yanmaani> And that's also how it figures out if something needs a lock.

[12:55:31] <mrig> I'm surprised by how many UNIX tools you can install and run from the CMD console on windows. :)
[12:55:42] <yanmaani> (2) Why hasn't anyone done it for the general issue of UB?
[12:56:26] <yanmaani> for example, I KNOW that C compilers draw conclusion about UB on the form of "X is dereferenced, ergo X != NULL, ergo remove this nullptr check"
[12:56:41] <mrig> yanmaani: you might like to read about race conditions, this is far worse than UB it would seem, and there is no way to check for it all.
[12:57:03] <yanmaani> Why don't C compilers add annotation on the form of "X is dereferenced inside f(), therefore X has to be not null, therefore the caller has to ensure that"
[12:57:12] <yanmaani> sort of like flow-based typing(?)

[19:32:13] <gas51627> so does it mean, that if your company opensources something then they basically can say fuck off if something does not work
[19:32:21] <pulse> it's a pretty bad business strategy to open source your software _if_ your business depends on revenue from said software
[19:32:36] <gas51627> right
[19:32:41] <ZombieMaster[m]> If you want to add a feature in an open source project, you can either code it yourself or you can sponsor it
[19:32:49] <pyzozord> on the other hand it might be quite good if other people start contributing fixes
[19:33:03] <gas51627> in this case it's just a convenience fluff that is open sourced
[19:33:15] <gas51627> even not a convenience
[19:33:33] <pulse> pyzozord, most people aren't professional programmers. if your business depends on some complex piece of code, i think it's safer for real world engineers to do it, than Thomas the IT student with 2 hours of spare time :p
[19:33:33] <gas51627> but just for some joe shmoe to click a button and have a running "hello world" project

[20:06:02] <davros> your gaming device would have an IP,port on your local network, but presumably the server needs to reference it differently
[20:07:44] <davros> what would a game server in the cloud use to address the game on your local device .. would that be a forwarded port on a global IP address for your intranet ? and your hub would arbtrate that?

[21:51:21] <Hash> that defeats the purpose. the goal is to keep server blind.

[22:02:38] <diophantom> idk
[22:02:43] <jeaye> Some servers store private keys. Depends on what the server is doing. If the server doesn't need the private key, don't put it on there.
[22:03:37] <kodah> Hash: how do you revoke that public key they use to post with?
[22:04:23] <jeaye> If we're talking about user private keys, you have the option of having the users store the keys (or a phrase to generate the key on demand) or the server doing so.

I'm looking for advice about terraform best practices, jira best practices ( should we use some jira template), documentation structure and stuff like that. Any advice is more than welcome.
