[03:10:49] <MrCollinsGA> if I want to cp something to another dir, but I only want it to copy certain file extensions such as mp4, avi, exe, jpg (or whatever choose) for instance but not anything else. I was thinking it was something  it would be something like "cp -r /foo/i$ if i$ {*.mp4, *.avi, *.jpg} then mv * /foo/bar" Im hoping I am sort of close? :)
[03:12:57] <donutfarian> why the mv? why not just "cp /foo/*.mp4 /foo/bar/"

[04:06:20] <Betal> I want to get the 2nd to last element from array, to have a working -- that redirect all parameters to another executable. Inside a while loop with case --, if I use ${*} I get the whole array (-- + all parameters), if I use ${@:n} I get n element, and ${@} the '--' itself. How I can get all values after -- ?
[04:07:26] <Betal> not sure if "shift", and then ${*} is a clean way to do it
[04:08:06] <e36freak> are you just trying to parse arguments?
[04:08:17] <e36freak> in your loop, just check $1 and shift them away as you read them
[04:08:23] <e36freak> you'll be left with all the non-option arguments

[15:51:21] <b100s> emanuele6, thank you! the `grep a.ou[t]` works if I run it in a separate window or just after `./a.out &` in a new line but not if I put it in the same line. If it is because of globs, why it is? What else it matches? in $pid I have e.g. "20896 20899" but there is no second pid. Seems there is a moment where my bash is alive and running this whole command (fork + exec) which matches the a.out ? : ) So i'm catching the fork?
[15:52:43] <emanuele6> b100s: if you actually read either of the pages i linked, you will see that [t] is a glob that matches t
[15:53:57] <b100s> emanuele6, yeah, it is true
[15:54:45] <emanuele6> also . in grep will not match dot, it will match any character:   `a.ou[t]'  or `a.out` match "about" or "aaout"

[16:16:25] <b100s> it says "grep sleep" vs "grep 'slee[p]'"
[16:16:36] <b100s> in my case I have the same grep
[16:16:59] <emanuele6> `sleep 10 & set -x; ps auxf | grep slee[p]' (http://ix.io/3LuC) with no file named "sleep", calls `grep 'slee[p]'' because the glob does not expand. so it only finds the sleep process.
[16:18:25] <emanuele6> with  `touch sleep; sleep 10 & set -x; ps auxf | grep slee[p]' (http://ix.io/3LuD), when a file named "sleep" exists, `grep sleep' gets called instead because slee[p] expands to sleep (the name of the "sleep" file) so it finds both the sleep process and "grep sleep"

[16:50:28] <Sumao> earendel wonderful. $ find -name '*.ts' -type f -exec grep -i '([A-Z]\w+)Type' -- {} +         doesn't work. I wonder why
[16:51:05] <Sumao> ##programming echo PropType | grep -i '([A-Z]\w+)Type' -- {} +
[16:51:32] <Sumao>  # echo PropType | grep -i '([A-Z]\w+)Type' -- {} +
[16:52:41] <tirnanog> because \w is a PCRE-ism, whereas + is of the ERE dialect (hence -E).
[16:54:29] *** Quits: ano (~ano@user/ano) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:56:02] <tirnanog> GNU grep will tolerate \w anyway, but it's non-standard.
[16:56:39] <Sumao> oh so there are multiple 'kinds" of regex? which one is most widely supported?
[16:57:35] <tirnanog> for the standard utilities, BRE and ERE (see man 7 regex if on gnu/linux). both sed and grep expect BRE by default, but support -E for the ERE dialect. sed -E isn't strictly standard yet, but it'll be in the next revision of posix.
[16:57:42] <kurahaupo> tirnanog: when did GNU grep start doing that?
[16:57:53] <tirnanog> kurahaupo: supporting \w?
[16:58:24] <kurahaupo> yes
[16:58:32] <tirnanog> it's done that for as long as I can remember. I'm unable to convey a timeline in this instance.

[17:01:33] <Sumao> so tirnanog i am save with BRE always?
[17:01:46] <wikan> hi. what may be a reason, "read -n 1" don't wait for a key?
[17:02:08] <Sumao> tirnanog if so, is BRE supported in all other programing langauges like javascript, java etc?
[17:02:11] <Sumao> s/save/safe
[17:02:18] <kurahaupo> wikan: Are you using it inside a loop that's fed from a pipe?
[17:02:27] <wikan> [read -n 1 key] in shell stops until key is pressed. In shell script doesn't.
[17:02:57] <wikan> kurahaupo: well, yes, i use it in a lop but not fed from a pipe...
[17:02:59] <emanuele6> read -n 1 (without -r) waits for two keys if the first key is \
[17:03:01] <kurahaupo> Sumao: Generally each system has one preferred RE dialect, and maybe some others
[17:03:27] <emanuele6> s/key/character/G
[17:03:28] <wikan> kurahaupo: i have read from pipe before, in different loop: bash -> cat menu | bash myscriipt.sh
[17:03:38] <kurahaupo> wikan: read -n1 will read one byte, not necessarily one key
[17:03:57] <emanuele6> or \ + one byte
[17:04:23] <tirnanog> Sumao: for pretty much any standard utility, if you do not request a different dialect, BRE is expected and you are, indeed, safe with it.
[17:04:30] <wikan> kurahaupo: i was reading from /dev/stdin to read pipe. This is "user control loop". Should I reset something?
[17:04:47] <Sumao> tirnanog ok, i wonder why people use other than BRE then
[17:04:49] <tirnanog> Sumao: BRE is further removed from the dialects used by languages such as java and javascript than ERE is.
[17:05:02] <kurahaupo> Any key that's not in the primary keyboard area (arrow keys, F keys, etc) will generate more than one byte
[17:05:09] <Sumao> tirnanog removed?
[17:05:24] <Sumao> tirnanog so js, java don't support BRE?
[17:05:36] <tirnanog> Sumao: well, speaking for myself, I use ERE often because it's more capable and because it's more like other dialects.
[17:05:41] <tirnanog> no, java does not support BRE.
[17:05:45] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[17:05:52] <tirnanog> it supports what might reasonably be called a superset of ERE.
[17:05:55] <emanuele6> java has its own regex dialect iirc, javascript uses perl compatible regular expressions
[17:05:56] *** Quits: Leonard (~Administr@114.55.127.80) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:05:56] <kurahaupo> BRE is the original syntax for RE. ERE was added about 5 years later, then PCRE about 10 years after that

[17:06:28] <emanuele6> !regex
[17:06:28] <greybot> Regular Expressions are used to *match* certain patterns in strings. They come in several flavors (BRE, ERE, PCRE, and more). Bash only supports EREs (using [[ string =~ pattern ]]). Sed uses BREs. See !ere, !bre, !pcre, http://mywiki.wooledge.org/RegularExpression
[17:06:32] <tirnanog> incidentally, bash uses ERE exclusively for its regular expression matching.
[17:06:39] <kurahaupo> BRE is generally faster than PCRE, sometime by multiple orders of magnitude
[17:08:20] <Sumao> emanuele6 kurahaupo tirnanog I just wanted to learn one regex that works on all (unix and programming languages
[17:08:37] <tirnanog> that's not going to happen.
[17:08:38] <emanuele6> BRE (at least POSIX BRE) is more powerful than ERE because it allows backreferences in patterns `\(a.*b\)\1', EREs don't allow `(a.*b)\1' (at least in POSIX)
[17:08:54] <wikan> ok i did "read -n 1 < /dev/stdout" and it work
[17:09:19] <kurahaupo> wikan: So you're inside a pipeline somehow?
[17:09:48] <wikan> i should not kurahaupo
[17:10:01] <wikan> i wrote a function to read pipe
[17:10:17] <wikan> i call this function and after this i do loop for reading key

[17:18:28] <tirnanog> work in what sense? it's not going to make any actual modifications to the files matched, if that's what you mean.
[17:18:36] <Sumao> didn't replaced anything
[17:18:51] <Sumao> tirnanog yes, no modifications happened
[17:18:59] <Inline> heh
[17:19:05] <emanuele6> yes, that sed is not a text editor.
[17:19:09] <tirnanog> are you using GNU sed?
[17:19:09] *** Joins: Filohuhum (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum)
[17:19:11] <geirha> sed just outputs the modified stream on stdout, it never edits a file
[17:19:11] <Inline> it will only modify stuff on stdout
[17:19:11] <koollman> Sumao: sed doesn't modify the file, by default
[17:19:18] <Sumao> tirnanog I am on linux
[17:19:33] <tirnanog> ok. sed -i will likely behave as you expect then.
[17:19:36] <koollman> gnu sed and bsd sed can modify it, but they need an option (-i) to do it. and they don't handle it the same way
[17:19:48] <Sumao> koollman am.. last time it did via `-i`
[17:19:49] <tirnanog> you still need -E for that pattern.
[17:19:59] <Sumao> koolazer oh
[17:20:00] <geirha> strictly they will replace the file with a new one, not modify the existing one
[17:20:13] <wikan> geirha: thx
[17:20:13] <kurahaupo> !sed-i
[17:20:13] <greybot> sed -i isn't portable; standard sed doesn't have it at all, GNU sed -i has an optional argument, and BSD sed -i has a mandatory argument. See !editing and <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/021> for advice
[17:20:21] <Sumao> so this will do ?find . -type f -name "*.ts*" -exec sed -iE 's/([[:upper:]][[:alpha:]]+)Types/t\1/g' {} \;
[17:20:29] <wikan> if it was to me
[17:20:40] <tirnanog> for GNU sed, yes.
[17:20:43] <koollman> no
[17:20:48] <Sumao> I gues ubuntu has gnu sed
[17:20:51] <Sumao> as I am on ubuntu
[17:20:52] <tirnanog> yes.
[17:20:56] <Sumao> koolazer no?
[17:21:00] <koollman>  -i must be on its own. anyting directly after i will be used as an extension to the backup file
[17:21:10] <emanuele6> indeed
[17:21:17] <emanuele6> -iE is the same as -i E
[17:21:22] <Sumao> am.. 'on its own'
[17:21:32] <Sumao> so not `-i -E` either?
[17:21:39] <koollman> -Ei, or -E -i or -i -E, but not -iE
[17:21:42] <kurahaupo> Note that sed -i creates a new file and replaces the original, EVEN IF NO CHANGES ARE MADE
[17:21:51] <Sumao> i see
[17:22:06] <Sumao> kurahaupo oh. interesting
[17:22:13] <tirnanog> yeah, they're right. sorry.
[17:22:24] <kurahaupo> So don't use it on things like live log files; you will leave other processes writing to the now-deleted file
[17:22:28] * earnest would use a sufficiently advanced editor to make these changes
[17:22:29] <koollman> typical usage of -i with argument attached : -i.bak , if replacing in file 'foo' it will save the old content in 'foo.bak'
[17:22:31] <emanuele6> kurahaupo: i think Sumao is Intello and i already told him how to use vim/ex instead of sed, but he insisted on using sed for some reason
[17:22:41] <koollman> (and -iE would save in 'fooE')
[17:23:16] <tirnanog> Sumao: as an aside, it'll be more efficient if you replace \; with +. sed can accept more than one pathname operand.
[17:23:23] <Sumao> emanuele6 I have to learn a lot about sed, grep, and vim. I also do not know what tool is best
[17:23:28] <Sumao> for this job
[17:23:43] <emanuele6> no, sed is a tool for editing streams, not text.
[17:23:44] <Sumao> tirnanog ok
[17:23:54] <Sumao> streams?
[17:24:30] <koollman> emanuele6: it can do both, so ... that's ok
[17:24:32] <emanuele6> also `sed -i' will change the modification time of all the files you use it on
[17:24:50] <emanuele6> even if no modification was made
[17:25:05] <kurahaupo> and the inode, and its ownership
[17:25:06] <emanuele6> but if you insist there is no point in arguing

[22:47:45] <Sumao> for grep and sed at least in linux I mean ^
[22:47:55] <tirnanog> Sumao: if it's a toss-up between BRE and ERE then ERE. easily.

[22:49:04] <Blondie101010> most command line utilities don't have full PCRE support
[22:49:07] <tirnanog> with many, many more features but yes.
[22:49:28] <tirnanog> that's what I meant when I said that BRE is more "removed" earlier.

[22:49:49] <Blondie101010> they all have their own constraints
[22:49:53] <tirnanog> all standard utilities if you're going by the posix specifications, for a start.
[22:50:10] <tirnanog> that GNU grep supports PCRE is a non-standard extension, for instance, and even depends on how it was compiled.
[22:50:20] <Blondie101010> and it's not complete

[22:57:33] <tirnanog> it's definitely a good place to start.

[22:59:33] <tirnanog> as was stated earlier, "BRE is the original syntax for RE. ERE was added about 5 years later, then PCRE about 10 years after that".
[22:59:46] <tirnanog> that seems like a fair pretext for considering it to be more modern, even before getting to its feature set.
[23:00:04] <emanuele6> that guy is showing  grep -o 'a\{3\}\+'  and calling it BRE
[23:00:12] <tirnanog> oh dear.
[23:00:18] <tirnanog> that's just sad.
[23:00:23] <tirnanog> (thanks, GNU)
[23:00:25] <emanuele6> does a\{3\} even make sense?

[23:01:36] <emanuele6> that is not true
[23:01:50] <emanuele6> `sed' is not required to support ERE
[23:01:51] <Blondie101010> Sumao:  you should probably lose your ultimate imaginary expectations and just learn to use things

[23:02:29] <emanuele6> EREs in sed are a little weird
[23:02:42] <emanuele6> because POSIX ERE don't support backreferences
[23:02:50] <Blondie101010> sed has its own syntax which is quite powerful, but almost no one bothers to learn (myself included)

[23:40:02] <tirnanog> ok, I see what it's implying. it implies that [[:space:]] wouldn't match a newline. it's wrong.
[23:40:16] <Sumao> tirnanog .. right. so is there any authenticated comparison out there?
[23:40:27] <tirnanog> # var=$'\n'; [[ $var =~ [[:space:]] ]] && echo match
[23:40:29] <shbot> tirnanog: match
[23:41:27] <tirnanog> it's mostly OK if you ignore the BRE and ERE columns.

[23:43:12] <Sumao> maybe fork and pr to his repo

[23:43:35] <Sumao> or just fork and change :)
[23:43:36] <tirnanog> try https://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html
[23:43:59] <tirnanog> it's not exactly a one-page rosetta stone but the sub-pages allow for you to switch dialects and the site has a decent repuation.
[23:45:07] <tirnanog> specifically, it lets you compare any two dialects and see which features are available in both.
[23:47:37] <Sumao> tirnanog oh that is awesome, it has all /comprehensive

[23:48:35] <tirnanog> in any case, be very wary of material you find concerning BRE and ERE unless it's from regex(7) or the posix documentation. a great many people simply have no idea what they are talking about.

[23:52:20] <Sumao> tirnanog I think I will just and compare ERE and PCRE from here unless I plan to use some totally different zone. Speaking of that, can awk do all and more than grep+sed combined?
