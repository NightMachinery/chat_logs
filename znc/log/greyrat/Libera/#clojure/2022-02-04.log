[00:49:52] <Frozenlock> I regularly think that macros aren't so bad, until I want to pass one around like I would a function. Then I get angry.
[00:50:32] <ToxicFrog> Write a functionize macro that turns a reference to a macro into an anonymous function wrapping it, then use that~

[07:39:23] <POGtastic> quick question: On Ubuntu, using Clojure 1.10.2, I can load java .class files in the current directory by running `clojure -cp .` In Arch, using Clojure 1.10.3, doing the same gets a `FileNotFoundException` because it's trying to open `-cp` as a file. The docs are kinda inscrutable on this subject, but suggest something with -M. Any suggestions?
[07:40:18] <POGtastic> (I've done the alternative of publishing the java class as a jar to my local Maven repo and loading it with Leiningen, but it's a pain for simple things)
[08:11:42] <POGtastic> I figured it out. it's ugly, but it works. I did `clj -Scp "$(clj -Spath):."` to calculate the current classpath and append "." to it

[11:10:40] <andreyorst> for real projects I prefer lein, as it doesn't get in the way. I often experiment with deps, but it's too barebones for my liking
[11:11:37] <andreyorst> the fact that you need to write build.clj script for your project calling tools.deps.build functions is both cool and horrible
[11:12:45] <andreyorst> * tools.build not tools.deps.build
[11:12:48] <v3ga> andreyorst: ah hah, thats what I'm experiencing.  i've been using it though i'm very familiar with lein from when I first toyed with lisp.  someone said I must like punishment =P 
[11:14:29] <v3ga> ...decisions 
[11:14:39] <andreyorst> I tend to favor simpler solutions, lein feels a bit overcomplicated, but on the other hand it is rock solid stable and does its job very well
[11:14:59] <andreyorst> at work we use lein
[11:15:39] <v3ga> yeah... i'll have to think it over over the next week or so but i'm wondering if I should 'stop playing' and head back over to lein for my serious project
[11:16:19] <v3ga> its just me but i'm also not that experienced.  No issues at the moment,just looking at other projects
[11:19:27] <andreyorst> one trouble I have with deps is that it can install things straight from git urls
[11:20:14] <andreyorst> so /some projects/ don't publish things at clojars for example, and I don't know how to add such dependencies thru lein
[11:21:38] <andreyorst> so I just spin up deps for these kind of projects
[11:21:43] <andreyorst> ahem, clj-kondo-config, AHEM

[21:13:53] <selfsymmetric-mu> Tried to use Clojure for a coding interview yesterday and kind of bombed. 
[21:14:03] <selfsymmetric-mu> Or well, not a total disaster but I couldn't get the code out in the right order.
[21:14:59] <selfsymmetric-mu> Was kind of a simulation-event-log task, so I thought about it like FRP, tried to write a nice efficient tail-recursive solution that didn't do more than it needed to. 
[21:15:32] <selfsymmetric-mu> I should have started with a time loop first, demo'd some test cases and enhanced it later.
[21:16:07] <selfsymmetric-mu> Somehow the coding challenge is still the flakiest part of the tech interview for me.
[21:16:30] <technomancy> our coding challenges are *very* basic
[21:16:55] <technomancy> like we push really hard for candidates to ignore optimal solutions in favor of readability and maintainability
[21:18:01] <selfsymmetric-mu> I should internalize that priority, if anything because it demonstrates competence early.
[21:18:12] <Para> Previous company used "parse ls output and find a file" as Clojure exercise; the shell exec to get the ls output was provided as is with (comment "implement your solution here")
[21:18:14] <technomancy> I am very suspicious of a process that has you writing code and optimizing it in the same interview. just getting something that works for a problem you are fresh on is tough enough.
[21:19:13] <selfsymmetric-mu> technomancy: It was totally my fault. Toward the end I acknowledged that I chose a bad architecture for the timeframe, and sketched out the alternative.
[21:19:39] <technomancy> sketching out what you would have done differently if you had more time can go a long way towards restoring my impression of a candidate personally

[21:20:45] <wink> you sound like anti-google :D
[21:20:58] <TimMc> Para: Are there extra points for noting that ls's man page explicitly warns against parsing the output?
[21:21:26] <selfsymmetric-mu> technomancy: Yeah, I think I still presented myself well, in that sense. Still, I want to get skill down pat, so that it's never the thing getting between me and a fitting position.
[21:21:33] <TimMc> (or, hmm, I thought it did)
[21:21:37] <ridcully_> i'd expect the tech-inverviewer to fall back over the chair if some one liner ninja solution using clojure is presented ;)
[21:21:51] <technomancy> wink: in multiple ways!
[21:21:57] <wink> hehe
[21:22:08] <selfsymmetric-mu> wink: Oddly enough I'm ex-Google. You'd think I'd be good at short coding puzzles.
[21:22:22] <wink> selfsymmetric-mu: or joined at the correct time :P
[21:22:57] <selfsymmetric-mu> lol
[21:23:00] <wink> I kinda went along the itnerview process once and it was a mess. not saying it wasn't partly my fault though
[21:23:14] <selfsymmetric-mu> wink: There is a huge luck component. 
[21:23:28] <wink> original engineer went missing, so someone replaced them. we did some coding in a shared google doc.
[21:23:44] <selfsymmetric-mu> wink: They flew me to California to interview for a New York position.
[21:23:52] <wink> and I was like: yeah I'm gonna strip() that string, or trim(). FIRST ERROR
[21:23:53] <technomancy> coding ... in a google doc? good lord
[21:24:01] <TimMc> haha yikes
[21:24:17] <TimMc> that sounds unpleasant
[21:24:18] <ggb> Joe Armstrong's, "Make it work, make it beautiful, and, if you must, make it fast," applies in interviews. Get something working. Ask if they'd like you to take time to make it nicer, or if it's okay to discuss. Talk about potential optimiztaion points.
[21:24:23] <wink> yeah the person also looked bored all the time. I liked the conversation, but meh
[21:24:28] <selfsymmetric-mu> I did bang out a full A* implementation for one problem. Gosh maybe I'm just getting worse at programming.
[21:25:35] <wink> yeah I think I didn't make obvious errors, but maybe my lack of klnowledge how mmap is implemented in the kernel was the dealbreaker
[21:25:51] <technomancy> ggb: yeah, it applies when you're interviewing for a position, and it also applies when you're the interviewer--you'll get a better read on your candidates if you tell them not to sweat the wrong things.

[23:03:29] <tatsumaru> hey guys, is cursive any better than emacs for clojure?
[23:04:55] <tatsumaru> maybe I am missing some packages on emacs, but I don't feel like it's automating any of my clojure work
[23:05:06] *** Joins: szkl (uid110435@id-110435.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[23:05:26] <jeaye> Neither is better, objectively.
[23:05:39] <jeaye> Whichever one you like more and are more effective with is better for you.
[23:05:46] <ridcully_> according to the users emacs is better
[23:05:56] <ridcully_> because they use it more
[23:06:13] <jeaye> More commonly used is only one metric for better.
[23:06:22] <ridcully_> but in the end i'd use what you are more comfortable with
[23:06:38] <ridcully_> jeaye: the fly metric...
[23:06:41] <tatsumaru> well I am more interested in subjective opinions rather than statistics, for example if you like it better or not
[23:06:53] <jeaye> I would never pay money for a text editor.
[23:07:20] <jeaye> So Cursive is ruled out. I also would only want to use an open source text editor, which rules out some others.
[23:07:27] <technomancy> I'd imagine most emacs users probably haven't even tried cursive
[23:08:26] <ridcully_> but why would they?
[23:09:51] <jeaye> tatsumaru: Maybe you're meaning to ask which packages emacs users use.
[23:10:08] <tatsumaru> is there some basic emacs profile for clojure I can download I think I am using a very old one with deprecated packages
[23:10:09] <jeaye> Since emacs is surely going to have one of the best workflows for Clojure.
[23:10:16] <ridcully_> i have to use it because i have to investigate "java" stuff - but i'd stay away from it if you don't have to
[23:18:57] <goodger> why is that "surely"?
[23:19:43] <tatsumaru> has anyone tried doom emacs?
[23:20:23] <ridcully_> i tried doom back when it came it out
[23:20:53] <tatsumaru> did you like it
[23:21:16] <ridcully_> hell i like it.  could not play it on my 286

[23:22:23] <technomancy> going back to revisit it I was surprised how much the additions in doom 2 helped. like the original just didn't have a wide enough variety of monsters to make for compelling gameplay.
[23:22:49] <technomancy> or at least, for gameplay which holds up decades later. at the time of course it was mind-blowing.
[23:23:26] <tatsumaru> i liked the music of doom 1

[23:29:10] <ridcully_> hell yeah!
[23:29:20] <tatsumaru> can I share a yt link here, it's a doom track

[23:44:19] <ridcully_> more than sigil's?
[23:44:38] <Para> Than Eternal's.
[23:45:45] <Para> Although lately I've started listening to Wipeout OSTs again.
[23:46:35] <manicennui> Para: Isn't Eternal mostly the same with a couple of additions?
[23:47:08] <Para> Well sort of, it's a mishmash because Mick Gordon failed to deliver an actual soundtrack so they had to cobble it together.
