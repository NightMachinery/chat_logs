[02:52:27] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> probably ask in #gnu:libera.chat they are more relevant to answer it though
[02:52:47] <Linux77> the entire course show the gnu project logo and ask for donations, and talka abou gnu project, i have a doubt if it is valid.
[02:53:12] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> valid in what sense
[02:53:35] <Linux77> if part of my donation is repassed to gnu project
[02:54:08] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> if you don't trust the author then submit the donation directly to GNU then
[02:54:17] <Linux77> ok
[02:54:31] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> and if you have a suspicion for fraud then contact the relevant enforcement or inform GNU about it

[14:36:59] <DiffieHellman> hackers? Did you mean crackers?
[14:37:07] <labrador> IRC is less secure than matrix.
[14:37:15] <DiffieHellman> Hacking is simply playful cleverness, with or without computers.
[14:37:20] <labrador> It doesn't have e2ee encryption
[14:37:35] <ewwegweg> labrador tls?
[14:37:44] *** Joins: GreenLlama (~quassel@80-219-124-12.dclient.hispeed.ch)
[14:37:47] <DiffieHellman> You can get e2e encryption on irc with OTR, but everyone else needs to use that as well.
[14:37:54] <labrador> ewwegweg, na. TLS is client to server encryption
[14:38:20] <labrador> E2ee on irc can be used with OTR plugin(I have one). XMPP usually uses OMEMO as its E@EE
[14:38:26] <labrador> But can use OpenPGP too
[14:38:34] <labrador> But on irc its not default
[14:38:36] <labrador> And its hard
[14:38:43] <DiffieHellman> irc servers can see all the text content on irc, but irc is kinda designed around that./
[14:38:45] <labrador> So prefer xmpp for that
[14:38:54] <ewwegweg> So I can't provide secure messaging with IRC
[14:38:58] <labrador> ewwegweg, nope
[14:39:20] <labrador> Use protocols based around e2ee and forward secrecy
[14:39:21] <kompowiec> labrador, if TLS/SSL is count
[14:39:28] <kompowiec> then yes, its secure
[14:39:31] <DiffieHellman> Provided that every client is conneted via TLS or Tor onion, channels won't be leaked online, sadly some people don't use TLS
[14:39:33] <labrador> Maybe use signal if no federation is fine
[14:39:45] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec: SSL is not secure at all and is depreciated.
[14:39:48] <labrador> DiffieHellman, the server can
[14:39:50] <ewwegweg> labrador ı dont like signal
[14:39:56] <labrador> DiffieHellman, eh SSl/TLs
[14:39:59] <labrador> same same
[14:40:08] <DiffieHellman> They are very different things.
[14:40:20] <DiffieHellman> Just because everyone is wrong doesn't mean you have to be to.
[14:40:39] <labrador> ewwegweg, why?
[14:40:57] <labrador> Its a superior protocol to even xmpp,if federation is not important
[14:41:03] <ewwegweg> labrador do you know sgx issue? and its not decentralized
[14:41:06] <labrador> You can host your own signal server
[14:41:18] <labrador> ewwegweg, eh thats the main signal server's choice
[14:41:27] <DiffieHellman> Signal is a bad example, as you need a phone number.
[14:41:37] <labrador> DiffieHellman, the protocol is nice tho
[14:41:43] <DiffieHellman> The XMPP protocol is a disaster.
[14:41:47] <labrador> Its protocol is secure
[14:41:50] <DiffieHellman> I don't know about signal though.
[14:42:06] <kompowiec> tbh the only normie-friendly IM now, is just matrix, not couting non-interoperable
[14:42:13] <ewwegweg> why DiffieldHellman
[14:42:20] <DiffieHellman> labrador: How come the free software release of Signal lags months behind the proprietary one though?
[14:42:21] <kompowiec> <DiffieHellman> The XMPP protocol is a disaster.
[14:42:25] <kompowiec> in compare to matrix is light
[14:42:34] <ewwegweg> <DiffieHellman> The XMPP protocol is a disaster. why

[15:27:11] <GNUHacker> ok i preffer TLS

[15:28:19] <ewwegweg> slow slow :D
[15:28:33] <DiffieHellman> If you optimize it, you can get a message every 5 seconds
[15:28:46] <ewwegweg> like a letter
[15:29:32] <ewwegweg> If IRC is secure for privata messaging ı only use irc and email
[15:29:38] *** Joins: isf (~iShareFre@user/isharefreedom)
[15:30:00] <ewwegweg> ısf  what do you think about irc private messaging
[15:30:05] <ewwegweg> isf
[15:30:18] <DiffieHellman> Irc is only secure for direct messaging if both clients are connecting via TLS and the server doesn't care to look.
[15:31:21] <DiffieHellman> DCC and OTR should be secure, but good luck getting that working.
[15:31:48] <DiffieHellman> e-mail sadly leaks metadata like no tommorrow thanks to many poor design choices
[15:34:15] <GNUHacker> you can send mails fastly
[15:35:04] <GNUHacker> ive a emacs script that send a mail when I write in IRC
[15:39:15] <ewwegweg> DiffieHellman Can it be as good as XMPP? I want to mount everything in one place if you look at it. I don't like to deal with more than one thing
[15:40:01] <ewwegweg> GNUHacker Do you have your own e mailing address
[15:40:17] <DiffieHellman> XMPP isn't good at all, but that's all I know about it.
[15:40:44] <GNUHacker> ewwegweg: yes, i ve
[15:41:25] <ewwegweg> <DiffieHellman> Why XMPP is bad for IRC
[15:41:34] <pert> DiffieHellman: I'm not who you were replying to, but I like XMPP. I find it effective for talking to my family. not looking to argue, but do you have any specific qualms with it?
[15:43:31] <DiffieHellman> XMPP is based off XML, which describes the issue in just a few words.
[15:44:08] *** Joins: Tangent-Man (~Tangent-M@cpc145602-basl14-2-0-cust33.20-1.cable.virginm.net)
[15:44:26] <DiffieHellman> XML is the best effort at levelling between human and machine, by making it really hard to read by both.
[15:45:29] <ewwegweg> Do you recommend irc instead XMPP?
[15:45:44] <DiffieHellman> Yes, as it least it works properly.
[15:45:59] <ewwegweg> but for private messaging with tls
[15:46:25] <DiffieHellman> For private messaging, you need to use OTR, or something else with irc.
[15:46:36] <ewwegweg> otr and tls ı guess
[15:47:23] <DiffieHellman> Just send a thicc envelope of OTP's to someone and encrypt each message with one OTP and do the same with the next.
[15:47:45] <DiffieHellman> Just gotta hope that the snail mail wasn't intercepted
[15:48:00] <pert> perhaps XML does make things harder for developers (I can't say I've done any XMPP programming, and writing an IRC bot vs. Jabber bot is surely simpler), but I respectfully disagree with your assertion that XMPP doesn't work
[15:49:06] <DiffieHellman> I din't say it didn't work at all, just that it doesn't work properly due to the design
[15:50:19] <pert> I do think XMPP is well-suited for confidential communications. a local hospital network near me uses it for all of their internal communications (unfortunately it's a closed network, i.e. patients cannot use XMPP to contact their physicians)
[15:52:00] <kompowiec> <DiffieHellman> XML is the best effort at levelling between human and machine, by making it really hard to read by both.
[15:52:02] <kompowiec> that's why I'm always mockingly talking about matrix which is a new generation protocol for people which don't understand XML and prefer JSON/YAML
[15:52:30] <DiffieHellman> JSON/YAML is terrible as well.
[15:52:40] <DiffieHellman> Why can't people design sane data formats?
[15:52:43] <ewwegweg> Matrix? No thanks.

[15:56:06] <ewwegweg> xmpp's problem is connect Tor. I can not sure
[15:56:23] <isf> matrix is trash becouse promote nonfree software

[15:56:56] <ewwegweg> how can ı sure isf? My client is Gajim
[15:57:01] <isf> lol
[15:57:08] <isf> you configure it?
[15:57:14] <ewwegweg> yes
[15:57:17] <isf> is running
[15:57:23] <isf> if tor is running in the port 
[15:57:25] <ewwegweg> 9050 127.0.0.1 socks5
[15:57:28] <isf> and you put the tor
[15:57:31] <isf> port
[15:57:33] <ewwegweg> yes
[15:57:34] <isf> so, are running
[15:57:37] <ewwegweg> torsocks gajim
[15:58:30] <isf> DifiHellman, what other federated chat protocol you know 
[15:58:32] <pert> torsocks has to be manually done in the terminal, is less robust (network connections may be done at a lower level than the POSIX network functions, and torsocks can't stop this), and setting up the proxy settings is just cleaner and more automatic
[15:58:38] <ewwegweg> Can I be sure isf
[15:58:43] <isf> sure of what
[15:59:09] <isf> sure of what ewwegweg
[15:59:09] <ewwegweg> gajim +tor
[15:59:15] <isf> i dont understend the question
[15:59:20] <ewwegweg> gajim +tor isf
[15:59:23] <isf> ok
[15:59:24] <isf> what happen
[15:59:32] <isf> sure about what
[15:59:37] <isf> about the conection?
[15:59:47] <pert> in Gajim, to use Tor go to Preferences --> Advanced --> Global Proxy (click the gear icon) and assuming you have a Tor daemon running on your machine (like one you installed with a package manager), do Type: SOCKS5, Host: localhost, Port: 9050
[15:59:54] <isf> if you use the port, and the host correctly, you are in tor
[16:00:06] <ewwegweg> proxy settings: 9050, 127.0.0.1, socks5
[16:00:22] <isf> ok
[16:00:22] <ewwegweg> and torsocks gajim
[16:00:37] <pert> you don't need torsocks if you have the proxy settings set up
[16:00:49] <isf> what is torsocks?
[16:00:52] <isf> is like other software?
[16:01:27] <pert> torsocks is a library that replaces the POSIX socket functions with equivalents that go over Tor. it's a hack that comes with Tor you can use when a program doesn't have configurable proxy settings
[16:01:32] <pert> using a program's proxy settings is always preferable
[16:01:35] <isf> say your jabber id ewweg
[16:01:45] <ewwegweg> I understand whether it's connected
[16:01:46] <isf> and i send you a image of how i have my connection via tor
[16:01:47] <ewwegweg> sorry
[16:02:31] <ewwegweg> How can i be sure
[16:03:23] <isf> if you put the other port
[16:03:27] <isf> you cant be secure
[16:03:44] <isf> is like the terminal, how you can be sure if you create a folder?
[16:03:48] <pert> you mean how you can test it? that's a good question. it won't be easy, but you could change Tor's configuration so that it logs Gajim going through it, and tells you whether there are probable DNS leaks or not
[16:04:35] <isf> you can see the difference
[16:04:46] <isf> in the internet velocity
[16:04:58] <isf> if messages are slow are in tor haha
[16:05:11] <ewwegweg> yes my message send slowly
[16:05:14] <isf> so
[16:05:17] <isf> welcome
[16:05:19] <labrador> ewwegweg, whats your lag?

[16:05:43] <isf> pert
[16:05:54] <isf> exist some group of fsf in xmpp?
[16:06:22] <pert> yes, the FSF provides free XMPP accounts to all FSF members. that's what I use

[16:06:44] <isf> no no
[16:06:49] <isf> im speaking about group
[16:06:53] <isf> no about the service
[16:06:56] <isf> of accounts
[16:06:59] <isf> server etc
[16:07:09] <isf> no just the service
[16:07:11] <labrador> isf, well if they did they might have briged it to irc too
[16:07:34] <pert> oh, you mean if there's like an #fsf equivalent on Jabber? I don't think so, but the FSFE does have one, and there are other free software discussion groups
[16:07:38] <isf> i feel like xmpp is better than irc
[16:08:32] <pert> one perk of XMPP MUCs (multi-user chats) is not having to be connected all the time. I like that I can fire up my client and see all of the discussion I had been missing out on
[16:08:52] <isf> if all are in xmpp, maybe that can help to move others outside nonfree chat communication, like whatsapp 
[16:08:54] <kompowiec> MUC required more resources than IRC (unicast list only)
[16:09:38] <isf> im in a muc right now
[16:09:45] <isf> bridge to irc and matrix in the same time lol
[16:10:02] <kompowiec> yeah i noticed you on matrix :)
[16:10:21] <isf> you read me on matrix kompowiec!?

[16:23:02] <isf> is better than debian
[16:23:04] <ewwegweg> Lance R Vick said Trisquel is not good distro because its based Ubuntu.
[16:23:14] <GNUHacker> trisquel is not ubuntu

[16:23:37] <pert> ewwegweg: darn, I didn't get it :( if you switch Tor off so we get something that works, we can run through troubleshooting like checking that Tor is working. if it's easier, you can private message me here on IRC also
[16:23:43] <kompowiec> the only difference between trisquel and debian it unblock installing non-free firmware and similar
[16:24:07] <DiffieHellman> GNUHacker: It's not Ubuntu, but based off it
[16:24:08] <isf> guys, here are a lot of technical users, but remeber free software, isnt about how program work, or if faster the software
[16:24:26] <isf> free software, is a ethical, social and political issue, about users freedom
[16:25:12] <isf> so, only exist this distributions: https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[16:25:16] <isf> all others are weak.
[16:25:44] <isf> all nonfree software is malware, or possible malware. So, Trisquel is better than ubuntu, debian, arch, and all propietary trash
[16:26:05] <isf> ubuntu, debian arch, and others propietary distros are trashing your freedom
[16:26:59] <DiffieHellman> Debian doesn't come with proprietary software by default, but you can enable that repo yes.
[16:27:07] <isf> diffiehellman
[16:27:10] <kompowiec> you don't have to convince those who are convinced

[16:27:35] <isf> and never is acceptable that
[16:27:37] <isf> never
[16:27:42] <isf> that is inmoral, and a injustice
[16:27:46] <pert> I'm a biased Debian contributor, but I don't consider it a proprietary distro. I think it merely allows users to make an informed decision on whether proprietary software's benefits outweigh the detriments in specific cases. non-free software has always been a sticking point in the Debian Developer community
[16:27:51] <isf> becouse you and all deserve freedom.

[16:29:18] <labrador> pert, you're doing a good job.
[16:29:26] <isf> but, if you depend of the computation, the best non-recommended distribution is debian.
[16:29:41] <DiffieHellman> isf: People aren't going to stop using computers though.
[16:30:04] <isf> nonfree software is a injustice

[18:03:23] <libredev> What the difference
[18:04:04] <gnoo> posix is the barebones specification for being cross-platform. it happens to specify a shell called 'sh'. bash implements 'sh' with much more other stuff
[18:04:20] <gnoo> there's 'dash' which also implements sh but only that and very few other things

[18:05:51] <gnoo> so, 'sh' is just a specification, like how cities have rules about what are the minimum things a house should have, it specifies what the minimum things a sh-shell should have

[19:01:11] <jxself> Yes, new versions of Linux-libre usually come out on a same day/next day kind of basis. So "old" doesn't seem to fit.
[19:01:22] <hiya> here he is
[19:02:36] <labrador> isf, your ctcp version says you use 4.15
[19:02:44] <labrador> -isf- VERSION HexChat 2.14.1 / Linux 4.15.0-161-generic [x86_64/995,50MHz/SMP]
[19:02:55] <isf> im not in the last version
[19:03:27] <isf> i have freedom to choise dude, im 100% free software user1
[19:03:29] <isf> !
[19:03:49] <labrador> isf, is this kernel even supported
[19:03:57] <labrador> i dont think so
[19:04:05] <jxself> Yes - The distro itself supports it.
[19:04:33] <jxself> You will find this happens a lot in Ubutnu, Debian, Red Hat, etc. where they freeze package versions when the stable version is released. And then apply on bug and security fixes.
[19:04:41] <labrador> how can that be jxself,even debian 10 uses 4.19
[19:05:00] <jxself> There's an example right there. 4.19 is not 5.16 :)
[19:05:14] <labrador> well isf uses 4.15 soooo
[19:05:20] <labrador> pretty old
[19:05:31] <jxself> Yeah, and that kernel version is still supported by the distro.
[19:05:47] <labrador> what distro u use isf?
[19:05:48] <jxself> Look at Red Hat for example - They support their releases, including the kernel, for 10+ years at a time.
[19:06:06] <isf> i use GNU 100% in Trisquel
[19:06:09] <isf> 9.0.1
[19:06:16] <jxself> Clearly kernel.org doesn't support a kernel release for that long, so Red Hat's doing that on their own. Just as other distros do too.
[19:07:23] <jxself> One benefit to free software is that you're not beholden to the original developers in order to continue to maintain and support something. You have the 4 freedoms to do that yourself. :)
[19:07:40] <jxself> Or, in this case, to let the distro maintainers do that for you.
[19:08:15] <jxself> In this case 4.15 will be supported by the distro until 2028-04-26.
[19:08:32] <jxself> 10 years!
[19:08:47] <labrador> oh trisquel is based on ubuntu 18.04
[19:08:57] *** Joins: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka)
[19:09:05] <labrador> and that kernel will be running till 2023
[19:09:14] <labrador> now I understand isf 
[19:09:30] <jxself> It will have extended support until 2028-04-26.
[19:09:49] <labrador> Its just felt weird to see older kernels than debian
[19:10:03] <labrador> jxself, by whom? the 2023 date is by ubuntu
[19:10:41] <jxself> 2023 is just the end of "standard" support. 
[19:10:45] <jxself> https://ubuntu.com/security/esm
[19:10:54] <jxself> Extended support is +5 more years after that, so 10 years in total
[19:11:09] <labrador> oh
[19:11:26] *** Quits: phebus (~phebus@fsf/member/phebus) (Quit: POKE 1,0)
[19:11:27] <labrador> this dwarfs debian's support period huh
[19:11:36] <jxself> It does seem to.
[19:11:45] <labrador> its just 5 years
[19:12:12] <jxself> And so you may find people with "old" things but that is not the same as "unsupported" or "unmaintained" :)
[19:13:20] <labrador> oh
[19:13:59] <jxself> I, for one, like the policy to freeze package versions on release and only apply bug and security fixes. I like my distros to be boring and uneventful. In this way I can work on the things that I want to work on, and not spending my time trying to fix some problem because because of some major version upgrade that happened.
[19:14:26] <jxself> I do understadn it's not for everyone though but I am quite happy with it.
[19:15:16] <isf> btw, thanks a lot jxself for the gnu-linux-libre :D
[19:15:17] <labrador> I like features

[20:38:09] <kompowiec> debian use kernel.org AND built with Linux-libre tools

[20:39:09] <kompowiec> indeed
[20:39:34] <kompowiec> so, the only difference between trisquel and debian is that there is no nonfree repository and non-free firmware installation isn't blocking.

[20:43:43] <jxself> I suppose it depends on how much one buys into the argument that "nonfree is not part of Debian." Despite that it's worked on by Debian developers, is integrated into their documentation and other tools (like the installer), receives support via their bug trackers and such, and even hosted by them.
[20:44:20] <jxself> For me that all too tightly integrated to buy the argument that it isn't a "part" of it; whatever that's supposed to mean.
[20:45:01] <kompowiec> therefore it is mainly a philosophical, not a technical difference.

[21:14:45] <kompowiec> isf, I already sent you a video today about a method of human manipulation called cherry picking, I even asked you a question, but you probably weren't there.
[21:14:56] <kompowiec> <kompowiec> I wonder how would you feel if someone introduced you as an example of cherry picking?

[21:45:36] <labrador> Like are you a part of the WoT?
[21:45:51] <GNUHacker> labrador: uh?
[21:46:03] <GNUHacker> you cant use the same kay to sign and to encrypt
[21:46:21] <labrador> what,why? An RSA key can do both
[21:46:25] <GNUHacker> allways are diferent keys
[21:46:52] <labrador> GNUHacker, cryptographically don't need to be. I'll need to see whats that about ig
[21:47:02] <GNUHacker> an GPG key pairs can do both, but it are 2 keys
[21:47:26] <labrador> GNUHacker, well duh. I was asking more about one subkey for signing and another for encryption
[21:47:31] <labrador> ig my wording was wrong
[21:47:47] <GNUHacker> when you generate keys you generate a key to sign and other key to encrypt
[21:47:59] <GNUHacker> this is a key pair
[21:48:06] <labrador> GNUHacker, the private and the public keys right?
[21:48:21] <labrador> you sign with the private and encrypt with the public
[21:48:32] <labrador> well others encrypt using public
[21:48:37] <GNUHacker> yes
[21:48:43] <GNUHacker> public is to encript
[21:48:47] <GNUHacker> private is to sign
[21:48:50] <AIM[m]> Yep
[21:49:08] <GNUHacker> you can have many publics and privates subkeys in one
[21:49:27] <GNUHacker> using: gpg --edit-keys , addkey
[21:49:44] <GNUHacker> it add a new subkey (to sign or to encrypt)
[21:50:17] <GNUHacker> try: gpg --edit-keys your@mail.org
[21:50:23] <labrador> I was more asking about is it a good idea to keep signing subkey pairs and encryption pairs,because many do that
[21:50:37] <labrador> Like they have 1 subkey pair for signing,and 1 for encryption
[21:51:04] <labrador> Keep in mind I'm talking about using different key pairs for different functions
[21:51:36] <AIM[m]> For easily remembering stuff
[21:51:36] <AIM[m]> For encryption, you want everyone to send you encrypted messages (public) but only you wanna decrypt it (private)
[21:51:36] <AIM[m]> For signing you want to be the one and only person who uses your signature (private) and you want the others to verify it (public)
[21:51:36] <AIM[m]> In any case you won't share your private key ever
[21:52:12] <labrador> ok
[21:52:25] <labrador> Also GNUHacker,has anyone signed your keys?
[21:52:28] <AIM[m]> That's how I remembered for my Cryptography classes

[23:42:25] <klys> irc is among the best at keeping the frequency aspect of trust.  it is perhaps the best way to get frequent trust for many lusers, or so it may seem.  other forums approach this by either requiring lusers to change the subject, by stipulating a subject, or by centralizing much of the subject matter.  irc keeps the available solutions plausibly open to discussion, so that the time you spend honors finding 
[23:42:31] <klys> solutions yourself.  this suggests a rather deep connection between the price of entry and frequncy of trust on irc.

[23:44:46] <Kaiod> klys: Interesting thought, very good!
[23:45:12] <Kaiod> GNUHacker: I've been waiting to update mine, enjoying the Sunday rest!
[23:47:35] <klys> kaiod, i would invite you to begin your thought by analyzing trust and finding the interrelated aspects of it as it exists in your work, home, environment, habitat, or recreation.  then it might be good for you to make a canonical list of such aspects as they apply to you.  third, you could map out how they are related to each other.
