[00:20:46] <geoffwozniak> So an hour before my day is done and I start vacation for a week.  Can't say I feel motivated to start anything substantial
[00:21:14] <ngoldbaum> doing anything fun next week?
[00:21:28] <geoffwozniak> Going camping and hiking up north
[00:21:56] <geoffwozniak> Weather predictions are decent, although we will surely get rained out for a day somewhere in there
[00:26:19] <geoffwozniak> Hoping that the nights are reasonably clear so I can go down to the lake and do some stargazing

[17:37:37] <companion_cube> Well the 4g was good, is that what you mean?
[17:38:17] <hoistbypetard> i meant the amtrak wifi offering. it's been good enough for me that i can take a 9h train instead of a 7h drive to go see my dad, and get in a pretty full work day
[17:39:05] <companion_cube> Ah I see, that makes sense.
[17:39:15] <companion_cube> Trains are good for working
[17:39:23] <hoistbypetard> with amtrak overall costing me a couple hundred more than my estimated cost of driving, that means effectively 2 extra vacation days for ~$200. an absolute steal :)

[20:01:09] <bradfier> Travolta may be a weird dude but he has his own type rating on all those planes he owns, which is no mean feat
[20:01:42] <prussian> I can't even imagine having enough money to fly a commercial jet
[20:02:15] <bradfier> Particularly not a 707 with four turbojets
[20:02:26] <bradfier> Approximately the fuel economy of a strategic bomber
[20:03:13] <prussian> I almost wonder if a Yacht is cheaper to run
[20:04:23] <prussian> well... I guess it has to "trickle down" somehow.
[20:06:07] <bradfier> The internet estimates the fuel consumption at 6000kg/h of JET-A, which you'll pay about $500/ton in the volumes anybody not an airline can buy
[20:07:27] <prussian> just blow through a few grand an hour. funny. they sell it by weight? wonder why they always have those encoder dispensers and the pulse counter displays.
[20:07:52] <prussian> I guess commercially, it would come in a truck by weight. but even then... weird
[20:08:08] <bradfier> So $3000/hr before any other costs, let's assume the costs for engine time, and all the ancilliaries are another 500/hr
[20:08:23] <bradfier> that's probably an underestimate considering this is a 60s design
[20:08:32] <prussian> ya. plus I wonder if the engine even has parts anymore.
[20:08:39] <bradfier> They sell it by weight because its volume changes with temperature
[20:09:17] <prussian> ya... true. but the dispensers still use encoders for counting volume.
[20:09:26] <prussian> doesn't matter. anyhow
[20:10:06] <bradfier> That's true, I presume they use temperature compensated encoders then
[20:10:29] <bradfier> I've only used self-serve AVGAS so I actually don't know if the JET-A pumps meter by volume, I guess they do
[20:10:32] <prussian> it's all proprietary, but ya. there are a few such things
[20:11:59] <prussian> I'm pretty sure it's by volume. I don't know a lot about airline stuff specifically. but I know all the veeder-root stuff like EMR/VR10 are volume
[20:13:02] <bradfier> I guess it's mostly because the airliners fly high enough that the tanks get appreciably colder than when the fuel was dispensed
[20:13:17] <bradfier> Whereas almost every other fuel platform will be 'close enough' to standard temp?

[20:14:41] <kirch> ergh.... SASL connection woes today all of a sudden (I've been offline for ~5 days).... and apparently my autojoin scripts aren't working
[20:15:10] <bradfier> They're the worst to debug because they only break 'sometimes' and I don't auth frequently enough to catch the edge cases
[20:15:26] <prussian> anyhow. I laughed, because I remember seeing a demo for EMR4 and they were using some 1970's era display that just parses pulse trains from the dispenser to incremet. I wondered if noise was a problem where they'd miss a pulse or so
[20:15:51] <prussian> so many better ways to send a value over a wire. lol

[21:45:46] <bradfier> If its original type certificate is still recognised by the FAA and supported by Boeing then yeah, there's no explicit certification process for flying over the ocean rather than land if you're not doing a commercial operation
[21:45:56] <bradfier> See also the crazy dudes who fly single engine cessnas from the US to Europe
[21:57:15] <gerikson> I guess it's different rules for passenger flights and transport
[21:59:51] <prussian> I think they still do pacific ocean flights on 757s solely because of ETOPS rules.

[22:58:32] <bradfier> Some kid worked out that it was determining the sale time locally and the server side component had a load of slack, made his own implementation that let you buy them early
