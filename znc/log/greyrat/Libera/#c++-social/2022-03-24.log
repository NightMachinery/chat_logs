[01:15:25] <Z`aT> nah, im in belgium
[01:15:36] <Z`aT> france is a full of retards
[01:15:47] <sbrothy> ah. its so bad there? your not biased? i was under the impression the difference wasnt so great
[01:15:48] <Z`aT> it's an awesome country though
[01:16:09] <sbrothy> "france is full of retards" generalize much? :D
[01:16:23] <Z`aT> no, reeally, it's full of retards
[01:16:35] <sbrothy> lol
[01:16:45] <dukwon> geography-wise, i don't like the arid bit in the south that much, but the rest of the country is nice
[01:16:54] <Z`aT> france was great in the 1800s , not so much now
[01:17:17] <sbrothy> been a while since france was on the news radar here
[01:17:18] <Z`aT> it's a 3rd world country
[01:17:41] <sbrothy> belgium too come to think about it. not since the IS terror attacks
[01:17:49] <Z`aT> the only thing they master, is wine and food (and spirits), for eveything else, go look else where

[01:18:50] <sbrothy> yeh. i can realte
[01:18:51] <Z`aT> but we dont pretend to be the center of the world
[01:19:03] <dukwon> lol
[01:19:04] <Z`aT> the french do, and they are wrong, SO wrong
[01:19:20] <Z`aT> like, 200years late
[01:19:24] <dukwon> brussels pretends to be the centre of europe
[01:19:29] <sbrothy> yeh a big countrys neighbours will probably have that feeling. although we dont with germany. then again our border with them is tiny
[01:19:40] <Z`aT> dukwon: that's politics only
[01:20:23] <sbrothy> but man france is a big country
[01:20:36] <dukwon> france's longest border is with brazil
[01:20:36] <sbrothy> maybe it goes to their heads
[01:20:45] <sbrothy> hah no shit?
[01:20:48] <dukwon> denmark is bigger if you count greenland
[01:20:55] <sbrothy> ah yeah but we dont really
[01:21:04] <sbrothy> ipso facto us
[01:21:37] <sbrothy> thule airbase and all that
[01:21:39] <Z`aT> nobody, living is burssels, is pretneding to be the center of europe. It happens that it was chosen to be bxl instead of strasbourg or/whatever 3rd choice, but that doesnt impact the whole neighbourghood (even if it did a little)
[01:22:25] <sbrothy> isnt brussel the de facto capital of Europe?
[01:22:59] <sbrothy> ive had a beer or 2
[01:23:10] <sbrothy> geography is one of the first sciences to slide
[01:23:13] <dukwon> should have been amsterdam
[01:23:18] <Z`aT> the schuman/european parliamant killed lots of populars/small houses to make romm for those ugly building
[01:23:23] <dukwon> CERN could have been in amsterdam
[01:23:26] <dukwon> or copenhagen
[01:23:56] <dukwon> but i think they would have been poor choices in the long run, when it came to start building underground colliders
[01:24:00] <Z`aT> but the rest of bxl do not care about being the center of europe
[01:24:01] <sbrothy> well architecure is the plaything of dictators

[12:57:05] <ERROH> i missed webb calibration picture by like a week,that's weak nerding on my part
[12:57:13] <ERROH> 'atlantis'
[12:57:37] <jotham> it's weird looking at earth through different projections
[12:57:40] <ERROH> was it greek who put maps on the side?
[12:57:46] <MaNI> first pluto isn't a planet, now underwater continents, where will the insanity end
[12:57:54] <ERROH> yeah, member that mediterean map from couple weeks ago?
[12:58:18] <jotham> wow that's quite heavy https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/stereographic=45.13,17.60,225
[12:58:29] <ERROH> https://i.redd.it/dpkd5p9fujd71.jpg
[12:58:35] <ERROH> cracks my head so much
[12:58:38] <jotham> computer authorization picard,four,five,alpha,atlantis, zoom in
[12:58:53] <jotham> ahh that's sick ERROH 
[12:58:56] <ERROH> i don't know if nzealanders get to see europe map a lot, but it's bonkers if you do
[12:59:14] <jotham> i have basically looked at maps and atlases since i was a tiny kid
[12:59:18] <jotham> cause they were science picture books
[12:59:21] <ERROH> same same
[12:59:24] <jotham> google earth blows my mind
[12:59:29] <jotham> google maps whatever
[12:59:42] <jotham> i only recently cognized how fucking deep the med is
[13:01:38] <jotham> in other news https://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/doi/10.46234/ccdcw2022.054
[13:01:47] <jotham> had never heard the term grey rhino event
[13:02:42] <ERROH> what am i looking at
[13:03:09] <jotham> new covid variant
[13:03:13] <jotham> deltacron 
[13:03:22] <ERROH> > The emergence of “Deltacron” is therefore a “grey rhino” rather than “black swan” event.
[13:03:25] <jotham> virus has started mutating in ways scientists think are exciting
[13:03:56] <ERROH> yay virus
[13:04:05] <ERROH> so proud of him
[13:13:56] <ERROH> why can't i find wtf a grey rhino is
[13:14:59] <jotham> okay so i tried to figure that out earlier
[13:15:06] <jotham> and here is my take from reading a few stupid things
[13:15:46] <MaNI> basically the opposite of a black swan
[13:15:50] <jotham> grey rhinos are the normal behaviour of the thing, in contrast to black swans which are the exceptional case of the thing, so the implication msut be until now the corona virus hasn't been exhibiting normal mutation behaviour
[13:15:57] <jotham> but now it's exibiting normal mutation behaviour
[13:16:07] <jotham> no longer novel
[13:16:16] <MaNI> black swan: the event that comes out of nowhere and flattens you because you were unprepared for it
[13:16:18] <jotham> but also possibly a lot more of a cluster fuck to deal with
[13:16:43] <MaNI> grey rhino: the bus that everyone saw coming a mile away but runs you over because you were too busy looking for black swans
[13:16:46] <jotham> that's why we have the acronym VOC
[13:18:12] <jotham> i have a crypto job offer that is mildly interesting
[13:18:14] <jotham> :\
[13:18:16] <jotham> :\\\\\\\\\
[13:18:24] <jotham> it's got nothing to do with bitcoin or nft or whatever
[13:18:36] <jotham> but also it's currency outside of my countries financial system
[13:18:47] <jotham> dunno what to think about it
[13:18:50] <jotham> it's just a weird sysadmin job
[13:19:04] <jotham> this is what people that work on weapon systems must feel like
[13:19:28] <ERROH> we've been flooded with job offers
[13:19:43] <jotham> all the ukrainians that were taking our jobs are fucked now
[13:19:49] <jotham> it's perfect
[13:20:19] <ERROH> half of them are western companies being afraid their russian employees will be cut out off the internet 
[13:20:27] <jotham> yeah exactly
[13:20:52] <ERROH> the other half are lviv and kiyv companies lacking manpower because some of their employees are in active combat duty
[13:21:13] <jotham> in this case it's swedish people sick of their useless american staff
[13:21:20] <jotham> but nz has a long history of taking american tech jobs

[13:31:29] <Z`aT> jotham: well, i know that it's tiny, for an even tinier you can also look next to it, the luxemburg
[13:31:47] <jotham> yeah my best mate is a welsh man living in lux
[13:31:50] <jotham> and it's vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv tiny
[13:33:05] <Renderwww> not sure why countries like lxemburg are still allowed to exist. All they do is providing postboxes and a place for shell companies for tax evasion reasons
[13:33:22] <jotham> yeah rich people banking 
[13:33:26] <jotham> same reason the uk still exists
[13:33:45] <jotham> uk exists to wash russian money from europe buying gas
[13:34:10] <Renderwww> that's probably all happening in the city of loondon, the rest might produce stuff of value
[13:34:29] <jotham> MMIND YOU SO DOES DEUTSCHE BANK
[13:34:41] <MaNI> I thought all they did in the uk was play football
[13:34:46] <jotham> naah it doesn't anymore Renderwww 
[13:34:53] <jotham> one good thing the germans have done
[13:35:28] <jotham> is legislatively organize to limit the hollowing out of medium sized industries by investment funds / corporate raiders, since they know it'll destroy all the smaller cities
[13:35:33] <jotham> uk never bothered
[13:35:42] <jotham> uk is ostensibly just the city of london now
[13:35:48] <jotham> makes sense scotland is toying with leaving
[13:36:01] <jotham> you have to assume brexit is so the uk can wash more money without european oversight 
[13:37:04] <jotham> bbc constantly reports on how previously prosperous towns and cities now have empty high streets because places like singapore buy up uk commercial realestate as a safe place to park money
[13:37:16] <jotham> which means none of these groups give a fuck about renting the properties
[13:38:31] <jotham> the excess of money trying to just meet global inflation is a wild problem
[13:38:49] <jotham> let alone all the financial instrument lottery of wall street and the city of london
[13:39:24] <jotham> nz has been struggling with pulling out of fossil fuel and weapon investments since our retirement program like most countries is based on investing in the stock market
[14:09:36] <ERROH> i wonder if shithole could invade nz
[14:09:54] <ERROH> i'm p. sure we have at least one battle cruiser
[14:10:12] <jotham> nz has a history of being abandoned after being conquered because there isn't much important here
[14:10:21] <jotham> so i think we'd need to have something a superpower needs
[14:10:24] <jotham> also it's hard to get gear here
[14:10:27] <jotham> and the terrain is weird
[14:11:23] <ERROH> i'll masturbate to that

[14:49:35] <ERROH> jesus reading western socialists i somewhat wish putin didn't stop and just marched on
[15:07:24] <Renderwww> are they pro or contra putler?
[15:09:12] <MaNI> careful you might still get your wish
[15:10:37] <ERROH> they're pro common worker so they protest supporting ukraine because the sooner zelenski is dead the sooner attocities stop and more means of productions are saved
[15:12:25] <MaNI> sounds like one of the pro russian saffers I keep arguing with whose entire argument seems to hinge on the idea that ukraine allowing "untrained" people to fight makes them evil and that rather everyone in ukraine should just capitulate/flee 
[15:15:46] <ERROH> oh, and they're also fine with eastern ukraine annexation because population there is russian speaking

[21:32:30] <Renderwww> so, how does one file a bug report or generate a debug trace for loonix not correctly waking up from suspend?
[21:36:14] <Oxyd> Just fix it yourself, it's open source!
[21:36:47] <Renderwww> Sir, please kindly do the needful and point me to the instructions!
[21:38:07] <jotham> lol Renderwww 
[21:38:12] <jotham> i got a ryzen thinkpad
[21:38:16] <jotham> cause intel fucking shit the bed
[21:38:23] <jotham> turns out it's as bad or worse than intel
[21:38:28] <jotham> it never wakes out of suspend property
[21:38:34] <jotham> has firmware updates every other week
[21:38:38] <jotham> has a variety of other problems
[21:38:48] <jotham> audio is occasional
[21:38:50] <jotham> not driver related
[21:39:09] <jotham> also at work i regularly fix bugs in other peopels stacks and try to submit them to the upstream
[21:39:11] <jotham> and get told to fuck off
[21:39:19] <Renderwww> if I switch on the monitor first and then use the power button to wake it up it works reliably. But if I hit the keyboard to wake it up it fails
[21:39:20] <jotham> mostly californian companies that are bullshit operators
[21:39:30] <jotham> the whole thing with foss now is an absolute disaster
[21:40:16] <Renderwww> guess I could just disable waking up on keyboard press and the problem would be "solved" for me
[21:41:42] <jotham> only way this has a happy ending is if this is your steamdeck
[21:42:10] <jotham> i always hit the shift key to wake my computers up
[21:42:18] <Renderwww> nope, it's my desktop
[21:42:18] <jotham> always figure meta is less chance of state change
[21:42:27] <Renderwww> steam kek suspend resume worked good so far
[21:42:47] <jotham> i really wanna play elden ring
[21:42:51] <jotham> feel like i'm missing out
[21:42:54] <jotham> argharghargh
[21:42:56] <Renderwww> once suspending during a game and resuming fucked up audio though
[21:43:07] <jotham> that sounds okay though
[21:43:16] <jotham> suspending resuming inside a game state is quite a lot
[21:43:21] <Renderwww> I'll put elden ring on my wishlist once I come around to playing dark souls
[21:43:33] <Renderwww> most of the time it works perfectly fine
[21:43:47] <Renderwww> I should try it with multiplayer games one day for shit and giggles
[21:43:48] <jotham> elden ring is dark souls for losers, but, breath of the wild quality
[21:43:51] <jotham> so it suits me
[21:44:01] <jotham> tempted to buy a console just to play it
[21:44:12] <Renderwww> why not play it on your computer?
[21:44:33] <jotham> computer needs a new cpu which means new mobo and gpus are stupid dumb price still
[21:44:48] <jotham> probably console for 2k and new pc for 2-5k
[21:44:57] <jotham> it's a tough market
[21:45:01] <jotham> kiwi peso*
[21:45:23] <jotham> still bankrupt so gotta think smart about it
[21:45:59] <Renderwww> aren't you rich now that you are out of the debtor's prison?
[21:46:35] <jotham> not yet
[21:46:41] <jotham> so 2 weeks ago i called them
[21:46:49] <jotham> and said aren't i free (yesterday)
[21:46:55] <jotham> and they said fuck off we will get back to you
[21:46:58] <jotham> called them 2 more times
[21:47:02] <jotham> each time over an hour on hold
[21:47:05] <jotham> they said stop calling
[21:47:11] <jotham> turns out my insolvency officer had covid
[21:47:13] <jotham> haha
[21:47:22] <jotham> and he called yesterday and said well actually
[21:47:28] <jotham> it's about 57~ more days
[21:47:33] <jotham> but yes then you are free
[21:47:36] <Renderwww> truly medical fascim, having covid infected cut of from using the telephone
[21:47:51] <jotham> i asked why my credit score was fucked because i can't even leave vodafone for another cellphone company
[21:47:59] <jotham> cause they rejected me twice now to change cellphone companies
[21:48:07] <jotham> and i can't get a power company to sign me up
[21:48:13] <jotham> i'm on poor persons prepaid power
[21:48:17] <jotham> which is almost 2x the price
[21:48:21] <jotham> and he said no idea
[21:48:23] <jotham> good luck
[21:48:25] <jotham> haha
[21:48:28] <Renderwww> uh, aren't power companies required to sign up whoever comes along?
[21:48:42] <jotham> apparently not bankrupt people in nz
[21:48:58] <jotham> so yeah i basically spend more than a normal person just to have basic services
[21:49:08] <jotham> while having 1/3 of my salary taken away
[21:49:11] <jotham> anyway long story short
[21:49:15] <jotham> he sent through the papers
[21:49:22] <jotham> so at least it's all written down and almost done
[21:49:30] <Renderwww> it always has been expensive to be poor
[21:49:36] <jotham> after 5 years since it started
[21:49:53] <jotham> but i was kinda hoping it'd be over now, got my hopes up
[21:49:56] <jotham> dickhead move
[21:50:04] <jotham> anyway i'd quite like a new pc, sure
[21:50:10] <jotham> but maybe a fancy console is the smarter move
[21:50:26] <jotham> pc is probably smarter but will cost a lot more
[21:50:35] <Renderwww> if you can find a console!
[21:50:35] <jotham> but at least i get all my steam games to come across
[21:50:41] <jotham> yeah i know
[21:50:53] <Renderwww> are cpu prices as fucked as gpu prices?
[21:50:58] <Renderwww> maybe only upgrade cpu+mobo now
[21:52:00] <jotham> sort of
[21:52:08] <jotham> you can get an okay cpu for cheap
[21:52:16] <jotham> a good cpu is expensive as shitballs
[21:52:22] <jotham> like 1-8 grand
[21:52:47] <jotham> 06:22:38   plzbum | 1.0 NZD (New Zealand dollar) = 0.6331934597019244 EUR (European euro)
[21:52:52] <jotham> but closer to 8 than 1
[21:53:30] <Renderwww> 5900x is around 460€ here
[21:53:47] <jotham> yeah but with cpus you don't want 4000 cores if you are an indie gamer
[21:53:52] <jotham> you want higher single core performance
[21:54:03] <jotham> cause unity and unreal aren't very thread natural
[21:54:11] <jotham> it's not like java games or w/e
[21:54:11] <Oxyd> I got a 5900X. I wanted a 5950X, but it was significantly more expensive.
[21:54:57] <Renderwww> I suspect any of those ryzen 9 is good enough
