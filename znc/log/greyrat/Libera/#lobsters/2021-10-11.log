[06:03:50] <Xe> skrzyp: yeah i'm gonna likely do it in a year or two
[06:03:59] <Xe> i'm okay with the 280M
[06:05:07] <skrzyp> Xe: in the next two years, the rg351v won't be relevant as new purchase due to its weird soc (rk3326, faster than ingenics tho)...
[06:05:12] <skrzyp> BUT, maybe not
[06:05:25] <Xe> well yeah
[06:05:37] <Xe> i meant with whatever anbernic is selling then :)
[06:05:51] <skrzyp> it has rather unique form factor and from what I see on the "handheld consoles" market they finally decided to go full on Android route
[06:06:22] <skrzyp> which means even more closed and quirky stuff and even weirder chink SoCs
[06:07:20] <skrzyp> currently they just patch around "stolen" FOSS projects like EmuELEC (LibreELEC + ES on top) and the whole construction is clone of HardKernel's Odroid Go Advance
[06:07:53] <skrzyp> the 280/350 is a "variation" of GCW0 and likes
[06:07:59] <Xe> yeah
[06:08:34] <Xe> honestly i'm okay with the jank of the 208m
[06:08:51] <Xe> no wifi isn't really that bad for me
[06:09:00] <skrzyp> it's using regular opendingux with gmenu2x, right?
[06:09:41] <Xe> yeah
[06:09:55] <Xe> i'm using the adam image
[06:09:57] <Xe> however tbh opendingux is all i need
[06:10:08] <Xe> i just wanna play super metroid and fusion on the go
[06:10:12] <skrzyp> I was just about to use gmenu2x in my rg351 image, but it seems its quite hardcoded on mips/gcw0/dingux in sources, including custom sleep routines and cpu "overclocking" in options menu
[06:11:31] <skrzyp> Xe: that's fine, I'm also focused on "games only" in regular "flashcart" style, but the current firmware on that newer devices starts to look more like "media center" thingy and instead of treating games as single ROMs, they tend to do some "game objects" with metadata and crap
[06:11:42] <Xe> yeah
[06:11:56] <Xe> that's great when you play only "normal games"
[06:12:02] <Xe> however i do romhacks
[06:12:36] <skrzyp> I just want to boot up under 1-2secs straight to "select rom file" like I have on my Mega Everdrive, EZ-Flash, R4 and so on
[06:12:49] <Xe> yeah, that's what i like about gmenu2x
[06:12:54] <technomancy> my kids got the odroid go advantage which is super impressive as an emulation handheld
[06:12:58] <Xe> it just does the do
[06:13:01] <skrzyp> https://github.com/skrzyp/neoflashcart - I'll probably push some nix/br stuff there soon, right now it's only interesting as readme stub
[06:13:02] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - skrzyp/neoflashcart: the “flashcart firmware” for portable handhelds ] - github.com
[06:13:07] <technomancy> everything from atari 2600 to PSP
[06:13:48] <skrzyp> forget the other files, I have a bit more advanced development going on my desk but it has too may blobs put here and there to be released yet
[06:13:57] *** Quits: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[06:14:39] <skrzyp> but I'm seriously thinking about moving onto nix on this project, even when I have a rather good experience with buildroot
[06:16:26] <Xe> if you do, please do a blog writeup on it
[06:16:46] <skrzyp> Xe: however, I'm not sure if I can build regular FHS rootfs with NixOS which won't have Nix in the resulting image after all - have you (as a local nixos guy) heard about some possibilities?
[06:17:08] <Xe> i'm not a guy, however i think you can patchelf your way around that
[06:17:19] <Xe> or just lie in linker flags
[06:17:29] <Xe> may need to do the build in a FHS env
[06:17:30] <skrzyp> I know about buildFHSUserEnv which is used for nix-shell, but I'm not so certain about it when building whole rootfs
[06:17:43] <Xe> one way to find out :)
[06:18:28] <skrzyp> yeah for sure, though I wonder about cross-compiling too
[06:19:02] <skrzyp> one way is to use qemu-user-static which is slow, another one is to spawn nixos on my RPi4 as it's aarch64 too
[06:19:13] <Church> Will still be slow
[06:19:39] <Xe> both evils are evil
[06:19:52] <skrzyp> and using macOS on aarch64 Mini M1 (which I'm writing this from) won't help me as well, correct?
[06:20:11] <Xe> not likely idk
[06:20:22] <Xe> maybe?
[06:20:23] <Xe> i'm not the best
[06:20:35] <skrzyp> I didn't any development on this machine directly tho
[06:20:51] <skrzyp> just bought it as a fancy terminal for all other machines I have + host for DAWs
[06:21:45] <skrzyp> but yeah, if I want to do nixos builds on aarch64, I should look for some beefy aarch64 machine with linux
[06:22:32] <skrzyp> and we all here can be pretty much sure that my company won't let me use its thunderX3 for that :D
[06:23:45] <Xe> tell them you are experimenting with pushing the state of the art forward for portable emulation devices and that the research you are doing will directly impact production servers in a positive way
[06:24:21] <skrzyp> Xe: that won't pass
[06:25:35] <skrzyp> Xe: best to say that the certain person from gcw0/opendingux devteam is sitting maybe two desks from me and I'm pretty much sure he tried to do that as well :D
[06:25:46] <Xe> oh well
[06:25:50] <Xe> rip
[06:26:17] <skrzyp> at least i've seen enough amount of weird chink emulation gizmos for my life
[06:26:23] <skrzyp> all of these running opendingux ofc
[06:27:04] <skrzyp> in the meantime I've looked up my nix crossbuild situation
[06:28:13] <skrzyp> and I'm pretty much screwed on that, still can't get why it won't allow me to use host-arch Nix and then evaluate derivations for target-arch

[16:55:42] <kline> maskd, people who write go are trying to pretend theyre elite systems programmers from the 80s
[16:56:12] <kline> so no fun allowed, no sensible tools, and if its anything more modern than hoares talk on CSP then it needs to be relegated to baby languages like python
[16:57:20] <rhn_mk1> at least there's a garbage collector
[16:57:25] <maskd> varjag: if they use tabs then you can set your editor to whatever you like, right?
[16:57:35] <maskd> it looks like GitHub uses 8 unless you pass a "ts" query parameter

[16:58:07] <kline> heres a sad thing about rust
[16:58:12] <maskd> I think that's part of the reason I feel uneasy looking at Go code
[16:58:27] <kline> writing rust if you're not using high-quality internet isnt very doable
[16:58:44] <rhn_mk1> the weight of the crates?

[16:58:49] <kline> rhn_mk1, yeah
[16:59:22] <kline> rhn_mk1, the npm approach to everything being a tiny package depending on dozens of other tiny packages means a lot of traffic
[16:59:33] <rhn_mk1> how much do your dependencies weigh combined?
[17:00:57] <rhn_mk1> mine after 4 years is: 429M    .cargo/registry
[17:01:00] <kline> 587M registry
[17:01:19] <varjag> wow
[17:02:00] <rhn_mk1> I will admit even if a single crate needs 20M it's a lot, but that needs nowhere near a high quality connection :)
[17:02:37] <kline> im on cellular only, and slow at that
[17:03:01] <kline> it taken several minutes to grab the dependencies, and i have a horrible feeling i just cost my employer several dollars
[17:04:15] <rhn_mk1> I think a worse problem is that it needs internet at all. A Linux distro usually has all programmer tools and you can just download it
[17:04:21] <rhn_mk1> to use it offline

[19:11:39] <kline> ignaloidas, thats because nobody cares about .so, but .io has an active campaign thats reaching the highest levels of international politics because reparations against western colonialism is "in vogue" just now

[19:13:10] <southclaws> often they are owned by private companies who liase with the gov
[19:13:17] <kline> if it does, its possible that .io will be administratively removed from the UK and there may be an attempt to use it as a farmable asset by those who claim it back

[19:42:20] <kline> rhn_mk1, i think using crates.io is probably less concerning that linking to git directly
[19:42:30] <rhn_mk1> concerning in which way?
[19:42:47] <companion_cube> rhn_mk1: decentralized way is not always better
[19:43:11] <kline> rhn_mk1, crates.io provides a focal point that can be managed and abstract the decisions on hosting. this way if github were to break, or go out of favour and people wanted to move elsewhere, you only need to update crates.io and not every bit of code with github .git links in it
[19:43:12] <companion_cube> for example linking to github archives (let's be realistic, that'd be the majority of the cases) means you can't enforce immutability of packages
[19:43:23] <companion_cube> what kline says
[19:43:35] <kline> its far easier to save crates.io than update every single github hardcoded url in the rust ecosystem
[19:43:35] <companion_cube> in OCaml we don't have an equivalent of crates.io and pacakges aren't actually immutable :(
[19:43:44] <rhn_mk1> decentralized spreads the risk, and Cargo.lock already takes care of immutability
[19:44:03] <kline> decentralised spreads the risk, but increases the frequency of failure
[19:44:15] <kline> it means people cant move projects from one host to another
[19:44:20] <rhn_mk1> kline: I see the focal point, but the same can be said about crates.io itself failing
[19:44:31] <kline> yes, thats my point though
[19:44:31] <rhn_mk1> that is a good point
[19:45:02] <kline> its easier to save just crates.io, than to have to guard against or recover from github, gitlab, sourcehut, etc going down
[19:45:11] <rb> companion_cube: headline: "some $POLITICS happened and now half of google is down because their build servers can't reach crates.io

[19:45:17] <rb> or w.e
[19:45:54] <rhn_mk1> can't wait for sth like ipfs paving the way for the solution with the upsides of both
[19:46:05] <companion_cube> rhn_mk1: cargo.lock will avoid silent mutation
[19:46:12] <kline> rhn_mk1, im not against decentralisation, but moving it to stuff like multiple hosts is just semi-centralised, not decentralised
[19:46:13] <companion_cube> but it'll still fail
[19:46:13] *** Quits: southclaws (~quassel@109.144.223.193) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[19:46:21] <kline> stuff like a DHT, ipfs, etc are better
[19:46:31] <companion_cube> yeah if ipfs was implemented in a reasonable way
[19:46:44] <kline> its the concept, not the implementation
[19:46:46] <rhn_mk1> what makes it unreasonable?
[19:46:58] <kline> multiple hosts is just semi-centralised, ie you have many points of centralised failure
[19:47:18] <kline> as opposed to decentralisation where you need many points all to fail before the failure becomes apparent
[19:47:28] <companion_cube> rhn_mk1: the resource consumption is bad
[19:47:32] <companion_cube> at least it was last time I tried
[19:47:35] <ignaloidas> it depends on what it's used for
[19:47:43] <rhn_mk1> I think messaging services call that federation when it's not peer to peer
[19:47:53] <companion_cube> I don't know why ipfs is (was?) such a dumpster fire, when bittorrent has had crazy good implementations for decades
[19:48:14] <rhn_mk1> is ipfs based on the same tech?
[19:48:19] <ignaloidas> e.g. fediverse would be semi-decentralised by you, but the each point of failure has a fairly limited blast radius
[19:48:21] <kline> companion_cube, not private, not secure, not invented here
[19:48:54] <companion_cube> wdym not secure
[19:48:59] <kline> with the dht at least its actually decentralised, rather than semi-centralised on trackers
[19:49:12] <pe> Good afternoon, something went down?
[19:49:43] <ignaloidas> no, just talking how things can go down
[19:55:04] <companion_cube> kline: curious what you mean by "private" though
[19:55:23] <companion_cube> in a content addressed system, it seems difficult to me to hide what you're browsing
[19:55:42] <companion_cube> if you say "I want content <hash>" anyone else can ask for the same, no?
[19:55:49] <kline> companion_cube, most bittorrent comms are not encrypted and tracking chatter is broadcast widely enough that there are several sites that will tell you what any given IP has been seen to torrent
[19:56:48] <companion_cube> sure
[19:56:51] <kline> you can of course argue that an IP isnt an identity but try explaining that to the angry wife who opened the letter from Big Media Co. saying that youve been stealing a lot of Bit Titty Teens
[19:56:53] <companion_cube> but how does ipfs improve on that?
[19:57:17] <kline> i dont know that it does, but bittorrent replacements ought to
[19:57:27] <companion_cube> heh
[19:57:30] <kline> theres a lot of room for improvement
[19:57:48] <companion_cube> I guess you could build tor inside of the DHT… ??
[19:57:58] <dimadima> i wish a bittorrent replacement existed that facilitated CoW so you coud modify things and still seed
[19:58:13] <kline> i did list bittorrent DHT alongside IPFS as something better as decentralised than semi-centralised
[19:58:54] <companion_cube> dimadima: that's probably very doable with what borg/rsync do
[19:59:02] <companion_cube> split your file into chunks in a predictable way
[19:59:13] <companion_cube> this way if you modify it, most of the chunks will remain the same, hopefully
[19:59:42] <ignaloidas> bittorrent v2 already splits files into chunks in a predicable way
[19:59:56] <companion_cube> nice.

[22:07:44] <ngoldbaum> why is it so important to tag your releases? the commit’s there…
[22:08:23] <ngoldbaum> >1 crate (the 394th most downloaded) is unique among the top 500 in providing what appears to be a mercurial repository. I didn't add Mercurial support to my script, so I didn't analyze it further.
[22:08:26] <ngoldbaum> lmao typical
[22:09:22] <ngoldbaum> also why is it so important that all code appear in the repo? what about generated code?
[22:10:39] <pe> The Go standard practice is to commit generated code.
[22:11:14] <ngoldbaum> there are often good reasons why the release tarball and repo are different, is all i’m saying
[22:11:27] * ngoldbaum is glad he doesn’t use go
[22:12:11] * danderson is glad ngoldbaum doesn't use go
[22:12:46] <danderson> But it doesn't really matter where generated code comes from, as long as theres a mechanism for producing deterministic builds from the source.
[22:12:56] <ngoldbaum> agreed there
[22:13:01] <danderson> What the source is called matters less than: if I provide the same inputs as you, do I get the same binaries back?
[22:13:06] <ngoldbaum> but that’s not what this blog is checking or advocating for
[22:14:18] <danderson> It seems to be trying to answer a slightly different question: the published inputs for a build are X. Does X match what the developer intended?
[22:14:39] <danderson> It's a real question, but it's a really narrow supply chain attack between "what's in git" and "what got shoved into the tarball"
[22:15:20] <riv> i hate python waf
[22:15:21] <danderson> Much more realistic supply chain attacks: ~nobody reviews the code in git anyway, so who cares what ends up in the tarball, you're trusting one layer removed already
[22:15:30] <riv> talking of supply chain attacks
[22:15:53] <ngoldbaum> danderson: maybe the code reviews would be better without the seas of autogenerated code :p
[22:16:17] <ngoldbaum> tbh i kinda hate codegen
[22:16:30] <danderson> eh, not particularly. You review the change to the code generator, and add a CI step to verify that the generator output is indeed what's been committed
[22:16:32] <ngoldbaum> too many clever-by-half solutions i’ve had to deal with
[22:16:55] <danderson> I've had the same problem but with macro-ful languages
[22:17:19] <danderson> whenever you give people a powerful mechanism, some will use it to create write-only code. That's a pity, but deleting the facility isn't the answer
[22:17:39] <danderson> if nothing else, not having either codegen or macros will make someone implement codegen or macros in a way the toolchain doesn't control
