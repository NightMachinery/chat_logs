[04:14:42] <mknod> emanuele6, I don't know if it is. Do you?
[04:15:01] <djp> not in this case, no :)
[04:15:31] <emanuele6> yes, cause he linked a page
[04:15:41] <djp> I'm just trying to figure out how to put a [ TIMER ON ] massage in the shell prompt
[04:15:51] <twkm> e.g., if it creates a file you could test if it exists.
[04:16:01] <emanuele6> how do you check if a timer is running? can you do that?
[04:17:54] <emanuele6> if you can, you just need to add something like: `PROMPT_COMMAND+=( 'if check_running; then _ps_timer=y; else _ps_timer=; fi') and PS1='${_ps_timer:+[ TIMER RUNNING]} rest of prompt \$'
[04:18:12] <twkm> ewww, _ prefixing.
[04:18:49] <djp> well yes, I have the "timer" status. In reality, the timer is just the duration between two entries. This is a "ledger tasklog" file (example, testing, it's quite a mess) https://github.com/linuxcaffe/task-timelog-hook/blob/main/tw.timeclock
[04:19:20] <emanuele6> if you are ok with having a fork and don't want random global variables, PS1='$(check_running && echo '[ TIMER RUNNING ]') rest of prompt \$'
[04:19:38] <djp> emanuele6 oh, neat PROMPT_COMMAND+=
[04:20:08] <emanuele6> you don't need PROMPT_COMMAND, but it prevents a fork if you care about that
[04:20:16] <djp> I'm planning to simply change the flag when starting the time, then clearing it on stop

[04:28:51] <djp> I wish
[04:29:32] <emanuele6> i wouldn't want a random program to change my prompt.
[04:29:39] <larryv> djp: are you *executing* the script? you can't change your interactive shell's variables from a script running in another process
[04:29:51] <ormaaj> Doesn't seem like it would be very useful to know about the timer whensver your next command happens to finish. PS1 just delimits the previous scrollback from the stuff you're typing. If I want some sort of notification I do it some other way via tmux or GUI.
[04:30:23] <emanuele6> i agree with ormaaj
[04:30:29] <djp> I just want to be made constantly aware, while in the shell, that there is a "timer" running
[04:31:37] <djp> is there another sort of "message with every prompt" approach? not necessarily on the same line
[04:32:22] <emanuele6> you can configure your PS1 to show the output of a command as shown above
[04:32:34] <djp> or would the script have to alter .profile, or something?

[04:33:31] <emanuele6> here is a simple example
[04:33:50] <mknod> djp, what ormaaj what saying is you'll only be constantly aware IF you are running actuals commands in your shell (i.e. updating the prompt on a regular basis).

[04:34:48] <djp> yes, I get that it's not a live, running timer, that's fine

[04:36:09] <djp> I will.. soon..

[04:36:41] <djp> emanuele6 that IS cool, thanks

[04:38:33] <emanuele6> anyway, you might want to look at using the status of tmux if you use tmux instead of bash's PS1
[04:39:27] <djp> emanuele6 I was thinking about tmux-line, or something like that
[04:39:28] <emanuele6> or maybe add an icon to your desktop environment's panel if it is capable of showing an icon only if a command succeeds
[04:39:39] <emanuele6> i don't know what tmux-line is.
[04:40:17] <djp> it's like powerline, for shell, or air-line, for vim, status-bar enhancers
[04:40:38] <emanuele6> not sure why you need that to show something in the tmux status bar.

[13:32:03] <enoq> that one gives me ./setantenv.sh:3: = not found
[13:32:05] <enoq> can't figure out what's wrong though

[13:32:48] <enoq> aaah, works in bash but fails in zsh
[13:32:54] <enoq> my bad
[13:33:08] <lopid> line 1
[13:35:19] <Soliton> a bit mean to call a bash script you should source .sh.
[13:35:58] <Soliton> also, echo * is quite bold.

[15:34:02] <earnestly> Bayes: Remember that everything is a string in the shell, quotes are used primarily for grouping them.  In many places the shell will implicitly split() expansions if they're not quoted according to IFS
[15:34:47] <earnestly> Bayes: The other purpose of quotes is to suppress the shell evaluating the string according to its syntax rules, such as 'single quotes' or \x single character quotes

[15:40:57] <Bayes> re: quoting "$val", if I need to quote it within a string, would var="blabla \"$var\" bla" be the way, or again no need to have all expression quoted?
[15:41:17] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[15:41:20] <Soliton> those inner quotes would be literal, not shell syntax.
[15:41:43] <Soliton> so if you need literal quotes sure but not to protect from word splitting.
[15:42:54] <Soliton> (simple assignement doesn't do word splitting or pathname expansion anyway.)
[15:43:06] <Bayes> so the general idea is... if I have a vector of strings, only use quotes if one element has a space (say, a "compound word" like "Doctor Who")
[15:43:24] <Soliton> yes or any other shell meta character.
[15:43:50] <Soliton> | & ; ( ) < > space tab newline

[19:07:20] <koollman> ormaaj: swapping \n and back helps because it helps add a \n that is not replaced afterward
[19:07:57] <koollman> (it is one way to join lines two by two, and split them back after sorting)
[19:08:33] <koollman> it would be much harder to use any other separator to join and split lines so that sort consider them as 'one line' during the sorting process

[19:18:45] <koollman> so a nice trick is to change the only known line separator to the only known unused caracter, then add that \n back as a field separator
[19:18:59] <koollman> but, can't do that in posix tooling (But it will work with gnu tools)
[19:19:15] <koollman> otherwise you have to add more constraints on the input

[22:46:46] <earnestly> mooz: The point of keys in a hash (associative array) is that you don't have to loop through it to look up the value behind it
[22:47:36] <twkm> there are 2 keys in your example mooz.
[22:48:02] *** Joins: voices- (~voices_@84.238.197.28)
[22:48:02] <twkm> but anyway, "${!hosts[@]}" provides all the keys.
[22:48:27] <mooz> right, so how do I loop through the keys and get each of the values? there's two for each key in my example
[22:49:00] <phy1729> there is one value, but you seem to want to interpret the string as an array of items separated by commas
[22:49:43] <mooz> space would be better, but figured that a comma would be easier for my example
[22:49:59] *** Joins: mixfix41 (~homefame@user/mixfix41)

[22:53:19] <twkm> probably should have used key instead of ix.  meh.
