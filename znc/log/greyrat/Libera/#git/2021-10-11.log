[09:58:14] <Guest41> no, i branched off master
[09:58:45] <JibStyle> ok, well simplest path would be to just merge your feature branch straight into master and push master
[09:59:00] <JibStyle> ie. bypass dev and staging
[09:59:36] <igemnace> ^ concur. some workflows call it a hotfix flow
[09:59:51] *** Joins: Anu (anunay@user/anunay)
[10:01:31] <Guest41> ok, so thats ok from a workflow standpoint? I guess im just trying to wrap my mind around what's best practice when staging and dev have other stuff in them that isn't ready for master
[10:01:54] <Guest41> builds kick off to the environments when code gets merged in btw
[10:02:11] <JibStyle> Well, that's more of an ethical (ie "workflow") question, not a technical one.
[10:02:54] <JibStyle> When you have time, you should probably review with your colleague _how_ the bad code got into dev and prod branches, and work to clean up those branches.
[10:03:22] <Guest41> also, should i be worried about getting that feature into the other branches as well? my understanding is it would be different shaw for each merge or rebase which would cause out-of-sync history
[10:03:38] <JibStyle> You should consider the workflow your team allows and whether a hotfix push to master is acceptable. It generally balances priority against risk.
[10:03:40] <Guest41> yes, i need to have a conversation with them for sure

[10:04:36] <igemnace> re: getting that feature into the other branches, that depends on your team of course, but something to note: if you want your staging environment to be representative of your produnction environment, you'd want the hotfix merged into staging as well
[10:04:40] <Guest41> i can define the workflow along with them (its just the two of us) so im trying to create that workflow
[10:05:16] <igemnace> s/produnction/production
[10:06:45] <Guest41> yeah, thats the problem code igemnace -> we agreed to keep staging synced with prod but tonight it has different history and im not sure it should be all merged to prod so now im left trying to figure out the best approach

[10:07:25] <JibStyle> If you want to test in staging before kicking off a master build, you could reset staging to master (ie discard the bad commits your colleague pushed), then merge your feature into staging and push.
[10:07:51] <JibStyle> I assume their commits still exist in your shared dev branch.
[10:09:07] <Guest41> Thanks, I thought about that JibStyle, but I thought that might require checking with him first? (No - he has different history in dev)
[10:09:28] <Guest41> its frustrating but also a good op to learn
[10:09:51] <JibStyle> Well, git won't force you to check with anyone ;)
[10:09:58] <Guest41> LOL
[10:10:26] <Guest41> well, should i tell him that i have new code in master and he'll have to rebase?
[10:10:51] <Guest41> his stuff
[10:11:01] <JibStyle> Keep in mind, even though his commits would be lost from the shared branch, they are not typically lost forever, technically. His local repo should still have his commits, and both your repos should still contain his commits in the reflog.

[10:20:24] <JibStyle> right -- which commits are your referring to
[10:21:18] <Guest41> well, if i rebase and merge to staging and rebase and merge to main wouldn't that cause different SHAs?
[10:21:34] <Guest41> and therefore throw the history off
[10:21:38] <JibStyle> Via rebase, yes
[10:22:13] <JibStyle> I was going to say: You could open 2 PRs: one for feature --> staging, and one for feature --> master. In both PRs the SHA of your feature tip would be the same.
[10:22:46] <JibStyle> I was assuming your feature was based off of master.
[10:23:25] <Guest41> I created the feature branch off of master, yes

[10:26:39] <JibStyle> You should rewind the staging branch to before it got the bad code. At that point, you could rebase or merge your feature to staging.

[11:02:54] <Guest41> so the only way to get staging and prod history aligned is to reset staging to master and then push feature to staging followed by pushing staging to master?

[11:04:42] <JibStyle> that is one way, yes. there are usually many many ways with git.
[11:05:03] <JibStyle> I think what you mean by "history aligned" is for the two branches to be exactly the same.
[11:05:19] <Guest41> yes, is that not the goal?

[11:06:30] *** Joins: AndrewYu (~andrew@user/andrewyu)
[11:08:32] <Guest41> is there an example scenario of when it would be ok for them to not me exactly the same?
[11:09:10] <JibStyle> The git data structure is an "acyclic directed graph" (basically a linked list, but nodes can also branch and merge, and cycles are illegal). "Commits" are analogous to nodes. "Branches" are analogous to pointers. So when your master and staging branches are "aligned" as you put it, there is really just one data structure in git, and your two "master" and "staging" pointers point to the same commit.
[11:10:24] <JibStyle> When you rebase a branch, you COPY the commits to a new location. That is why they have different SHAs than before (the SHAs are analogous to node addresses).
[11:11:48] <JibStyle> You could create the desired data structure using just your feature branch, then "reset" master and staging to the new tip of your feature branch. The end result would be the same.
[11:11:52] *** Joins: Disconsented (~quassel@107.170.227.20)
[11:12:30] <JibStyle> "Reset" just updates the branch pointer to a new commit address (ie. SHA value).

[19:07:26] <Jong> hi. I have a fork that has been approved to be merged into the master branch. But since I made my fork many changes have been made in the source code file I worked on.  So how do I merge it.. I see on github a merge button, but I'm afraid if I press it, it will automerge incorrectly
[19:10:11] <mackerman> Jong: Merge locally with git commands
[19:10:42] <mackerman> !eekamerge
[19:10:42] <gitinfo> [!eekaconflict] Merge conflicts are a natural part of collaboration. When facing one, *don't panic*. Read "How to resolve conflicts" in man git-merge and http://git-scm.com/book/ch3-2.html#Basic-Merge-Conflicts then carefully go through the conflicts. Picking one side verbatim is not always the right choice! A nice video explaining merge conflicts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz7NuSCH6II
[19:11:48] <roxlu> hey, I'm on some branch e.g. `feature` which someoe else just updated and pushed.  I just did a `git pull` and got a `Already up to date`.  Then I did a `git fetch && git pull` and it merged the changes that we pushed. How's that possible?

[19:18:25] <ikke> !ignore_tracked
[19:18:25] <gitinfo> Git only applies ignore patterns to untracked files. You can't use ignore patterns to ignore changes to files that are already tracked by git. To remove files only from git, but keeping them on disk, use git rm --cached <file>. Still, see https://gist.github.com/1423106 for ways people have worked around the problem.

[19:22:57] <Jong> upstream repo I mean
[19:23:31] <ikke> Jong: two options: merge the target branch in your feature branch
[19:23:40] <ikke> or rebase your feature branch onto the upstream target branch
[19:24:11] <Jong> I forked from the upstream repo.  In my forked repo, I created a branch. I made a pull request which pushed the branch to the upstream as a pull request pending review. It was reviewed and approved.  Now what? I'm stuck
[19:24:40] <ikke> Jong: add the upstream repository as a remote to your local repository

[21:24:47] <beuys> I noticed that the original Bitcoin code has functions related to play poker:
[21:24:53] <beuys> https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/uibase.cpp#L1573
[21:25:00] <thiago> how do you think so, instead of knowing so? You're the one who said "next". Do you mean towards the past or towards the future?
[21:25:01] <beuys> And I wanted to see when that was removed.

[21:25:31] <thiago> ok
[21:25:33] <beuys> And I would find it interesting when they were removed.
[21:26:15] <thiago> yeah, finding removal is not easy with Git

[21:26:40] <thiago> from the command line: git log -S"something that was removed" -- filename.cpp
[21:27:03] <beuys> I don't have a command line. I'm on my phone.
[21:27:29] <thiago> then go to a laptop and clone it
[21:28:15] <mackerman> Or try one of the git GUIs for phone

[23:05:48] <Jong> I made a fork that changed one file from an upstream repo.  The repo has since vastly changed. I fetched from the upstream, switched to master. Then I did a git reset branchname, and manually pasted in the one file I changed. Now what I do I do?
[23:06:33] <Jong> git reset branchname basically switched branches from master to to my branch, while keeping the code as it is in master
[23:06:42] <Jong> that way I could paste in the 1 file I touched

[23:35:20] <Jong> cbreak right right, that's what I wanted.  (I think)
[23:35:38] <Jong> I changed only one file, yet my branch is way behind main upstream.
[23:35:54] <Jong> So I thought that I'll pull the upstream repo into my local main
[23:36:07] <Jong> then I'll do git reset mybranch
[23:36:20] <Jong> then I'd copy and paste my change
[23:36:58] <cbreak> what you should have done is to commit your changes, then run git pull --rebase
[23:37:37] <cbreak> if you want to use reset to go to upstream, that will discard all your local changes.
[23:37:57] <cbreak> without additional parameters, it will discard your local changes in history (all commits), and in the index
[23:38:02] <cbreak> but it will not touch file content
