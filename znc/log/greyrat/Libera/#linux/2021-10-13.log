[05:07:25] <MrPockets> if all I'm really looking for is an SMB accessible share?
[05:08:31] <nb-ben> there's some chance of information death if it was not sent through the internet. But if it left your router at home, the information is likely to be eternally replicated
[05:08:39] <TheGuestMovie> because it brings a LOT of quality-of-life improvements. A fantastic web UI to manage your system with just a few clicks instead of spending a week learning SMB. For example instead of using RAID5, you can use their "SHR1", basically RAID5, but growable, you just insert bigger drives one at a time. Cant do that with mdadm RAID without moving your

[12:08:34] <TJ-> pabed: there's a more elegant way; use dnsmasq to to associate an invented (e.g. "example.org") domain-name for the range of addresses you do not want to proxy, have dnsmaq listen on a new virtual interface, and tell curl (--dns-interface=<virtual>) or wget (--bind-dns-address=) to use the dnsmasq instance. Set dnsmasq as a forwarder to the system's existing nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf so it
[12:08:36] <TJ-> works as normal for the domains you DO NOT want to proxy. Then just put your invented domain in no_proxy/NO_PROXY=.example.org

[12:39:07] <purpux> I have a doubt about how while reads files. When I run this: `while read; do echo $REPLY; done < file`, does while go through every line of the file and pass that into read ? Is there any other command other than read I can use to see how this works ?
[12:39:45] <rindolf> jjt: it doesn't
[12:40:06] <geirha> purpux: while just runs the read command. And the read command reads one line from stdin

[12:41:18] <geirha> purpux: read will try to read a line, that is all bytes until it encounters a \n. If it encounters a \n it returns success(0), so the while loop iterates. If it instead reaches EOF, it returns failure(1) and the while loop ends

[16:37:50] <dminuoso> Psi-Jack: if you have non-owner generatable hardlinks, you can effectively prevent permission upgrading.

[17:35:06] <Psi-Jack> saint_: Well, for starters, you really shouldn't.
[17:35:18] <saint_> Psi-Jack should not what ?

[23:56:44] <Guest8432> not sure if the router can enable both ethernet and USB at once
[23:57:03] <NiLon> samba doesn't host the printer itself but basically proxies the commands to a service that hosts it
[23:57:13] <NiLon> so you would need to install printer service to router as well
[23:57:57] <NiLon> and if it's just a router box you might find that bit difficult

[23:58:27] <Guest8432> I suggest again to use a PC to serve printing
[23:58:29] <NiLon> sometimes consumer routers have the usb port with sambe to provide sharing files from external hdd or something
[23:58:30] *** Joins: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua)
[23:58:41] <NiLon> but not to share printers
[23:58:50] <koala_man> oh, I just read the backlog
[23:58:50] <Psi-Jack> heh
[23:59:05] <Guest8432> NiLon: that makes more sense
[23:59:06] <koala_man> CoolerX: if the router supports sharing files with Samba, that does not automatically mean it allows sharing printers

[23:59:34] <CoolerX> koala_man, yeah
[23:59:38] <Guest8432> in the other hand, I am not experienced with standalone network printers
