[01:09:54] <companion_cube> 😓
[01:25:48] <manicennui> Hmm.
[01:26:16] <manicennui> There seem to be far too many places where the JDK version, Java language version, and Kotlin version are configured in a project in IntelliJ.
[01:28:03] <manicennui> I feel like I should create the project by hand without the IDE and see how badly it screws it up once I open it.
[01:29:02] <manicennui> It even included a batch file for Windows. Helpful.
[01:46:21] <manicennui> Using command line gradle seems a bit better.
[01:46:30] <manicennui> Let's see what happens when I open it in IntelliJ
[02:00:59] <manicennui> Okay, the IntelliJ stuff is limited to the .idea directory. That seems acceptable.
[02:01:44] <manicennui> When I create a project through IntelliJ, it doesn't add build to .gitignore.
[02:01:51] <manicennui> Minor annoyance, but not sure why it wouldn't do that.
[02:02:40] <manicennui> I can maybe understand wanting some compiled classes in git, but it fills the build directory with all kinds of stuff.

[07:56:38] <kline> nato has made it quite clear all we're going to do is wag fingers about this
[07:58:13] <kline> i think its wrong and failing to do so when it was just crimea has whats lead to this, and itll become harder and harder to push back the more we embolden russia and china
[07:58:50] <kline> but it looks like we're going to do nothing, so to save a little risk now we will give up probably the dominance the west has in the world

[09:33:34] <imode> woah what the fuck.
[09:33:39] <imode> what the fuck happened.
[09:35:28] <imode> ngoldbaum: what the fuck is going on.
[09:35:38] <imode> I've missed all of this.
[09:37:01] <klardotsh> tl;dr putin yolo-invaded ukraine, ukraine is under martial law lockdown, putin more or less dared NATO to do something about it and (from what I gather through summaries) was like "lol I have nukes what's up punk?", US/NATO is rolling out "more sanctions"
[09:37:41] <imode> great. fuck russia.
[09:37:44] <klardotsh> that's my IRC-length summary so far of what I've picked up. I was trying to bury my head a bit in the sand and not hear about it but when nearly every channel I idle in + reddit is now talking about it, I figured I may as well go figure out wtf is actually happening.
[09:38:36] <imode> how much you wanna bet russia doesn't even have a functioning nuclear stockpile.
[09:38:42] <defect> and it's not just those two eastern separatist states
[09:38:59] <klardotsh> ah yes. important context. "explosions" and air raid sirens in Kyiv
[09:39:27] <imode> if the US wanted to they could teleport some fucking agents into putin's ready room and boom boom pow.
[09:39:30] <imode> but we don't.
[09:39:46] <imode> rather, biden and the chiefs of staff don't.
[09:40:23] <klardotsh> the best idea I've heard so far was some redditor who was like "dude fuck it sink all the oligarch yachts". cheap, effective, can be stealthy ish, costs them bazillions of dollars, doesn't involve boots on ground
[09:41:18] <imode> fuck it. do boots on the ground. we're talking about a sparse nation barely under direct control duking it out with one of the most sophisticated and heavily funded militaries in the entire world.
[09:41:39] <manicennui> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMVKOF-WQAQUUiZ?format=jpg&name=large
[09:41:55] <imode> if we're going to war we might as well act like it.
[09:41:57] <klardotsh> the risk there is MAD and Putin's seemingly-full understanding that nuclear war is on the table and indication that he's not afraid of it.
[09:41:58] <bkero> Fuck I have to wake up in six and a half hours to catch a flight.
[09:42:15] <bkero> Gotta be rough to be Edward Snowden right now.
[09:43:07] <imode> klardotsh: let putin crawl back into his hidey hole while the rest of the world fights for ukraine and the surrounding states.
[09:43:15] <imode> MAD is mutual. he dies too.
[09:43:19] <klardotsh> imode: I don't mean that as a "fuck you you're wrong" to be absolutely clear. I agree with you that Ukraine needs the NATO help, what I don't know (and why I am no military strategist) is how to avoid the entire Pacific US coast (that I live on, lol) being turned into radioactive ash
[09:43:26] <klardotsh> fair
[09:43:51] <imode> if he thinks he doesn't, well, let's see how far his ego is willing to test that theory.
[09:44:11] <imode> I'm not afraid of a nation propped up by lies operating in darkness because they're too weak. this is a giant prop story.
[09:45:09] <imode> if there's one thing the global powers agree on is that long-term stability is greater than short term stability, insamuch as a little brawl every now and again via some proxy nations won't cause total nuclear destruction of civilization.
[09:45:27] <imode> we saw this with syria but we didn't know who the players were.
[09:46:40] <imode> your way of life isn't going to end until NYC gets blown to bits by a nuke.
[09:47:00] <imode> mourn for the sensless loss of life.
[09:47:47] <Church> Bingo
[09:48:00] <Church> Me I've got whiskey and cartoons
[09:48:05] <Church> And some delicious bacon
[09:48:22] <imode> get laid and blow off some steam.
[09:48:28] <imode> helps the head.
[09:50:41] <klardotsh> all I selfishly ask is for a good hour or so's notice of the nuke (if one comes to washington state) so I can light a final joint. that's the only ask I have for myself, otherwise, no point in myself panicking too much
[09:51:17] <imode> if washington state gets nuked we're headed to fuckin spokane.
[09:51:22] <klardotsh> I'm either blown to bits or not on a personal level, and otherwise, agreed, all love to Ukrainians dealing with pointless warmongering
[09:51:25] <imode> no incentive to nuke a desert.

[10:04:26] <kline> imode, thers a clip of them getting a drone
[10:04:41] <kline> possibly cruise missile
[10:04:53] <kline> either way its something jet powered and it goes pop
[10:11:42] <imode> won't be surprised if biden announces we're at war as well.
[10:25:11] <kline> thatd be sick
[10:25:36] <klardotsh> seems unlikely to me. ukraine isn't nato so we aren't obligated to do so, and I somehow doubt he's willing to do the Actual Formal Thing for a non-NATO country and piss off RU's allies too
[10:25:55] <imode> my family is already planning our escape plan if shit goes awry.
[10:26:06] <klardotsh> though one could argue that none of RU's allies actually give a shit about Putin's motherland agenda right now and wouldn't back him if US declared war...
[10:26:21] <imode> our best bet is to head north, then east.
[10:26:33] <imode> 8 military bases (that we even know of) in washington.
[10:26:53] <klardotsh> heh. my escape plan is "see how much shit my sailboat can hold that I picked up at the grocery store an hour prior, and set sail for AUS/NZ that probably won't take me anyway but at least the trip will be fun"
[10:27:11] <klardotsh> or maybe just to Alaska. what does Russia care about Alaska these days anyway?
[10:27:12] <imode> won't help when everett gets nuked.
[10:27:22] <imode> uh, quite a bit, there's quite a few bases up there.
[10:27:24] <imode> anchorage.
[10:27:39] <klardotsh> I'm 20mi outside bellingham, seattle/everett getting nuked is a risk for me but thankfully not an immediate existential risk
[10:28:09] <imode> considering there's a string of bases from yakima to tacoma to everett all the way up to whidbey, go east.
[10:28:19] <klardotsh> oh, I mean, my long term life goal is to settle in SE AK (Juneau/Ketchikan/Sitka/etc. area), where AFAIK there's no major nuke targets
[10:28:27] <klardotsh> eh, fair
[10:28:51] <klardotsh> I forgot about whidbey. that's close even here in the mt baker foothills.
[10:28:54] <imode> yeah.
[10:29:05] <imode> and the fallout will get you unless you head north and east.
[10:29:21] * klardotsh curses 20 being closed until April/May...
[10:29:33] <kline> klardotsh | I'm 20mi outside bellingham, seattle/everett getting nuked is a risk for me
[10:29:35] <imode> head for idaho.
[10:29:36] <kline> i live on an air force base
[10:29:40] * kline dabs
[10:29:42] <imode> oh my god you're fucked.
[10:29:49] <imode> wait are you in the air force.
[10:29:50] <klardotsh> kline: ooooof buddy. I'm so sorry
[10:29:55] <kline> its not happening
[10:30:08] <kline> the west isnt going to do more than angry words and limp sanctions
[10:31:06] <imode> hope that's accurate.
[10:31:15] <klardotsh> I hate that you're right because that means Putin will learn, as he did in 2014, that he can do whatever and get away with it, so long as "whatever" isn't "invade a NATO nation with boots on ground"
[10:31:23] <klardotsh> but you're probably right
[10:32:12] <kline> yes
[10:32:24] <kline> this is one of those best time to plant a tree things
[10:32:33] <kline> would have been best to stand up to him in 2014
[10:32:37] <kline> but the second best is now
[10:32:46] <kline> and if we dont because its "hard", its only going to get harder
[10:32:56] <imode> stamp out the cockroaches before they breed.
[10:33:23] <kline> i dont think we need to go to war to acheive this, but i think as it gets harder, it becomes more and more difficult to avoid it
[10:33:54] <kline> we probably wont need to go to war if we were to essentially economically blockade rather than merely sanction russia
[10:34:29] <klardotsh> yeah this whole pissy fit from putin would be over in a week if US and/or NATO simply economically decided RU no longer existed
[10:34:41] <klardotsh> ban all comms, trade, finance, and travel to RU, and this shit is over
[10:34:49] <imode> why not?
[10:34:51] <imode> oh right, money.
[10:34:56] <kline> yeah
[10:35:30] <kline> so its serious money, blood, or a balance of the two to put russia back in its box, but the west is so fractured domestically it wont happen
[10:36:20] <klardotsh> my mini tinfoil hat has _thoughts_ here but I'm enough ciders deep that I'm gonna not go there quite yet
[10:36:32] <klardotsh> but I _will_ +1 the "fractured domestically" aspect and leave it at that

[19:54:58] <imode> morning folks, what'd I miss.
[19:56:26] <indigo> Hey imode! How goes it :)
[19:56:34] <kline> imode, russians making up for the stalker 2 cancellation by engaging in combat at chernobyl
[19:56:57] <kline> uk to announce new sanctions in ~30 mins
[19:57:37] <kline> otherwise ukraine still getting dabbed on and increasing amounts of impressive video, including a fighter jet firing a rocket in a residential area
[19:58:10] <imode> fuck.
[19:58:20] <imode> do we have casualty numbers on either side yet.
[19:58:28] <imode> indigo: same ol' shit. we got an inch of snow.
[19:58:32] <imode> which is nice.
[19:58:34] <ngoldbaum> https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/1496879448607580168
[19:58:34] <buttsbot> Twatter - marwilliamson - Maybe an effort to understand dark psychic forces and creating a Department of Peace aren't so silly after all.
[20:00:55] <kline> imode, no casualty numbers or lists, and anything you see for probably the next 2 weeks will be propaganda
[20:01:29] <imode> yeah.
[20:01:36] <imode> also, what the fuck amazon.
[20:01:50] <imode> buddy of mine and I were chatting about email storms literally yesterday.
[20:01:57] <imode> I wake up and someone's subscribed all of corporate to a mailing list.
[20:02:15] <Xe> was there a vaction autoresponder
[20:02:35] <imode> 18k of them.
[20:02:44] <Xe> LOL
[20:02:48] <Xe> did any get in a loop
[20:03:04] <imode> oh DID THEY EVER
[20:03:22] <Xe> :DDDDDDDDD
[20:03:28] <Xe> chaos in the streets
[20:05:18] <indigo> Is there also a flurry of "please take me off this mailing list"
[20:06:05] <imode> along with a whole host of meme gifs.
[20:06:28] <imode> "stop it. get some help."
[20:06:44] <imode> everyone's hitting 'reply all' and it's just amplifying the noise.
[20:06:53] <imode> my buddy is going to be absolutely in stitches.
[20:08:05] <imode> holy shit it's been going on since 10 PM LAST NIGHT?!

[20:10:50] <manicennui> Linoleic acid is high in all kinds of seed oils.
[20:11:04] <imode> excusez moi
[20:11:07] <imode> is that a LAPTOP.
[20:11:53] <manicennui> I wonder whether GPUs will be affordable again in my lifetime.
[20:12:06] <imode> that is fucking unbelievable, drakonis.
[20:12:20] <imode> the fucking string lmfao.
[20:12:37] <indigo> Fuck GPUs, I just don't want another war
[20:13:28] <imode> are his jumper wires just headphone jacks?!
[20:14:17] <drakonis> yes???
[20:14:41] <imode> this dude is chaotic good.
[20:31:56] <indigo> manicennui: Have you been watching Severance?
[20:34:53] <manicennui> Nope.
[20:34:59] <manicennui> I'm rewatching Longmire.
[20:37:08] <kline> uk sanctions another ~100 entities (biz/individuals) on top of "hundreds" already sanctioned
[20:37:11] <kline> so a fractional increase
[20:37:21] <kline> aeroflot banned from uk operation
[20:37:51] <kline> all dual-use products (anything with a military purpose including, say, telephony and electronics) prohibited from export to ru
[20:38:13] <manicennui> I hope someone sells a ribbon I can buy to show my support.
[20:38:27] <kline> UK to exclude russian gas
[20:38:36] <edk> we hardly use any russian gas anyway
[20:38:43] <edk> wake me up when germany imposes any meaningful sanctions
[20:38:45] <kline> edk, yeah, easy signalling point
[20:38:56] <kline> UK advocates for but cannot exclude russian from SWIFT
[20:39:14] <edk> it would be funny how weak the western response to this is if it weren't so sad
[20:39:20] <kline> PM comments that russian economy is down by 45%
[20:39:40] <kline> so mostly the most effective sanctions against russia are self-imposed
[20:40:12] <edk> we could at least anonymously destroy the crimean bridge
[20:40:45] <kline> "no creeping normalisation" of situation
[20:40:55] <kline> (stand by for PM to remove sanctions by 2023)
[20:43:09] <kline> "slava ukraini", pm
[20:43:17] <kline> bitter feelings
[20:49:25] <indigo> If Russia gets excluded from SWIFT it is time to buy bitcoin and other crypto
[20:50:02] <imode> what makes you say that.
[20:50:17] <kline> theresa may speaking, who did nothing after a russian chemical weapon attack on uk soil
[20:52:07] <gerikson> imode: easier to avoid currency restrictions
[20:53:30] <edk> to a degree, but russians need to be able to cash out in russia
[20:55:25] <indigo> Russia uses a lot of US currency internally
[20:57:26] <kline> ethereum is down as well
[20:57:44] <kline> buying that dip is probably profitable if you are into speculating on crypto (ps, its all worth nothing in the end)
[20:58:13] <cb> cryptocurrency, the self-denying fiat
[20:58:17] <kline> labour MP asking the PM for details on whats happening with russian troops in chernnobyl
[20:58:29] <kline> as if the PM has their orders tucked away in his briefcase

[21:03:46] <cb> i thought jetbrains was czech?
[21:04:04] <manicennui> Most of the development is in Russia.
[21:04:18] <manicennui> So I guess it depends on what you are hoping to accomplish.
[21:04:22] <gerikson> $old_company has a lot of Russian customers
[21:04:58] <manicennui> I'm not a fan of sanctions that only affect the average citizen of a country.
[21:05:07] <manicennui> The people causing the problems are never impacted much.
[21:06:19] <gerikson> of course not
[21:07:18] <manicennui> I assume we know something about the assets of Putin and the people close to him.
[21:09:37] <kline> edk, SNP announce that alex salmond promises to stop broadcasting on RT lmoa
[21:10:14] <edk> i wonder if boris paid them for that
[21:15:14] <kline> apparently uk supplied javs have been secured 3 tank kills

[23:28:56] <manicennui> Seeing the reports about the Russian stock market is interesting.
