[02:01:03] <f8e4_> Burkuf in case of debian, follow the install menu and full disk encryption, absolutely sufficent
[02:02:06] <f8e4_>  veracrypt (vc) really shines in crypted volumes, imo less for partitions or even OS. read the manual rlly
[02:04:32] <Burkuf> What would you use if you are not on debian?

[09:43:25] <euouae> I'm trying to understand the security risk of using a random router/modem
[09:44:10] <euouae> I've read that in certain cases a bugged router/modem is given to someone to spy on them. But how does that work given that e.g. TLS works over insecure channels?

[09:50:25] <piou> euouae: First of all not everything is over TLS but thankfully most important things are. An established TLS connection is pretty much impossible to attack you're right about that, but the process of establishing that connection can be flimsy. For example many websites propose both HTTPS and a HTTP page redirecting you to HTTPS. Thing is, many browsers will try HTTP by default so there is a small
[09:50:31] <piou> window where an attacker can hijack that unencrypted first connection and avoid the redirection to HTTPS altogether. Other attacks on the same concept (avoiding the HTTPS connection by manipulating how this connection is established) exist and while there are ways to protect against them (eg: HTTPS everywhere and HSTS) they're still relevant today.
[09:51:40] <euouae> piou: I have not read about HSTS yet. Does it help in particular with what I asked?
[09:52:16] <piou> euouae: yes, but not on your end. It's a way for a website to say "Hey browser mate, I support HTTPS so please don't connect to me with HTTP ever again"

[09:52:56] <euouae> piou: What in particular can a router/modem do in terms of x509 certificates? (i.e. contain some bad ones, but how are they used?)
[09:53:04] <piou> Nothing
[09:53:08] <euouae> Got it, thanks
[09:53:09] <piou> That's not decided at their level
[09:53:27] <piou> They generally control DNS though, and that can be attacked too
[09:53:38] <piou> Sure you might want an HTTPS connection, but if yourbank.com points to an attacker's website instead of your bank you'll have issues. And DNS queries are typically rarely encrypted.
[09:54:03] <piou> Like all attacks it's not perfect, but when it's possible it's very effective

[09:56:27] <euouae> Thanks for your help, I appreciate it :)
[09:56:34] <piou> Sure, look into DNSSEC. Well, it's not encrypted, but it's protected against modifications.
[09:56:44] <piou> Which is what matters in this case.
[09:57:50] <euouae> tor-only system probably solves a lot of these problems

[09:58:34] <piou> tor isn't really designed for that but yes, they do mitigate most of these problems
[09:58:57] <euouae> aside from tor, how can one force TLS-only connections? is it via the firewall?
[09:59:00] <piou> Note that many things stil aren't encrypted by default so if you can spare $50 I would recommend you take a little raspberry pi or a few years of VPS and setup your own little VPN, it's much easier than you'd think and you'd get all the security you need
[09:59:32] <piou> euouae: thing is TLS isn't available for everything nor is it always the solution. What you want is a globally encrypted connection and that's what a VPN is going to provide you.
[09:59:51] <euouae> I don't understand how the pi would solve the issue
[09:59:58] <piou> hosting a vpn
[09:59:58] <euouae> It's a gateway, but so what?
[10:00:08] <piou> leave it at home
[10:00:21] <piou> The VPN connects you securely to a network you trust, so there is a sensible advantage to hosting your own.

[10:01:04] <Hash> You pay for it, and you get only one IP.
[10:01:19] <piou> I understood your initial question as "I want to connect to random networks I don't know" but maybe you were asking about using routers at home?
[10:01:22] <Hash> Even with a routed /64 in ipv6 space, you have your own network prefix so you're still identifiable.
[10:01:34] <euouae> piou, no worries you understood fine
[10:01:49] <Hash> It's better to go with something like a good well known VPN server to get multiple IPs. If you were going that route for something
[10:02:04] <euouae> This may be a stupid Q but wouldn't you need to have internet access to your home network? I don't know how to do that because I don't understand how my home router connects with an ISP core router. can I ask my ISP for my IP?
[10:02:12] <Hash> If you need private acess to your own network, wireguard is a good solution.
[10:02:37] <Hash> euouae: you can get your ip with logging into your router and checking the network information
[10:02:53] <Hash> router will grab ip info from ISP via DHCP (mostly common config)
[10:03:32] <euouae> so home routers are connected to the internet? Can't ISPs set giant NATs within a neighborhood e.g.?
[10:03:33] <Hash> You can run a wireguard instance in your own internal home network,open the required ports on system, forward the requried ports on router to your internal host
[10:03:35] <piou> Yes, you would need internet access to your home network, and if you go to something like https://www.myip.com/ you'll see your external IP. It is possible that the ISP has some constraint and needs contacting but generally if you just forward an external port on your outside router at home you'll have access to that

[10:06:21] <Hash> Router REQUESTS IP and gateway config from ISP to connect to Internet. Router runs its own DHCP server so your LAN hosts can get IP assigned to it dynamically from the router, like 10.x or 192.x
[10:06:39] <euouae> so e.g. my phone's plan also has an assigned IP?
[10:06:57] <piou> sure
[10:06:58] <ejrn[m]> no, phones are usually behind CGNAT
[10:07:03] <piou> oh, right
[10:07:14] <euouae> ok so NATs are a thing then
[10:07:19] <ejrn[m]> so they have an internal IP address to the CGNAT, and their traffic exits somewhere. for T-Mobile that's texas.
[10:07:28] <euouae> So why do ISPs bother giving IPs to customers instead of placing them behind NAT? Is it because everyone wants an IP?
[10:07:45] <ejrn[m]> just historical.
[10:07:47] <Hash> They could do that.
[10:08:05] <ejrn[m]> most cable connections ans consumer ISPs give out dynamic IP addresses anyway that get assigned per session.
[10:08:05] <piou> euouae: some do, but it's not the most common. If you do have that issue contact your ISP and ask.
[10:08:08] <euouae> I mean, given their greediness, why not do that by default? with IP being more expensive?
[10:08:09] <Hash> It doesn't make a difference other than ISP keeping another internal routing table.

[10:10:19] <ejrn[m]> really nothing a consumer is doing today uses incoming connections anyway so it's sort of irrelevant
[10:10:46] <piou> Or host your VPN elsewhere. A VPS is a nice alternative, good connection and the people managing it are probably not trying to intercept your traffic since that's not where (most of?) their money comes from.
[10:10:54] <euouae> you mean the average consumer with social media apps etc?
[10:11:15] <ejrn[m]> the average consumer with anything.

[10:11:48] <piou> Not much but still
[10:12:16] <ejrn[m]> tunnelling through consumer routers has been such a pain for long enough that nothing relies on being able to do it, it's not uncommon for users to be behind double NAT, or other absurd shit that makes it impossible

[10:13:30] <piou> I am. Have a "main" router which is provided by my ISP, and a front router running my local network.

[10:14:30] <ejrn[m]> me, I just extracted the GPON from my consumer router and cloned the MAC address
[10:14:31] <Disconsented> Because users can hardly plug them in and get on the wifi, let alone configure PPP
[10:15:02] <euouae> ejrn[m], what does that mean? You had to tinker with the internals?
[10:15:02] <piou> Plug the box, it gets updated, it supports everything the contract says it provides, and in case of issue you can get a technician to fix it because they know what it does.
[10:15:44] <ejrn[m]> the GPON is the bit which turns fibre into SFP. so I tore it out of the consumer router, and plugged the module into my server, and we're off to the races.
