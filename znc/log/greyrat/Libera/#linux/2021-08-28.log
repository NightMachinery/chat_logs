[01:28:54] <Penagwin> Thanks again for the help TJ- I would have no idea where to go past the basic `/etc/groups`

[01:46:56] <TJ-> Penagwin: as above; after adding a user to a group if you want to use that group immediately then "newgrp <groupname>"
[01:47:14] <Penagwin> When I did that it would ask for a password
[01:47:24] <Penagwin> and it didn't seem to accept anything I put in

[01:49:02] <TJ-> most folks don't realise groups can have passwords too (stored in /etc/gshadow)
[01:49:36] <Penagwin> I have no idea why the docker group would
[01:50:04] <TJ-> Penagwin: you can check easily if the password field is set: "sudo grep docker /etc/gshadow "
[01:50:08] <ayecee> either that or the user isn't a member of the group yet. does "groups acme" show it as a member yet?

[01:50:42] <Penagwin> the docker group isn't in /etc/gshadow

[01:50:56] <TJ-> Penagwin: aha, so it is using LDAP
[01:50:59] <Penagwin> ayecee that's the issue, I couldn't get it added
[01:51:00] <Penagwin> yeah
[01:51:12] <TJ-> someone did a nice job on that!
[01:51:15] <ayecee> Penagwin: right, that's the reason newgrp doesn't work either.
[01:51:39] <Penagwin> I'm mostly just handed a vm to setup for our application, and we experimented with LDAP a while ago
[01:51:46] <Penagwin> So yeah it's just fudging with me
[01:52:08] <Penagwin> We'll have to figure out if we use ldap on the rest of the servers, or just use ansible scripts to setup users

[07:23:46] <n4dir> saving lives works damn well, it seems.
[07:23:47] <codebam> podman can generate systemd units
[07:23:56] <codebam> it's so useful
[07:24:21] <Vol[m]> codebam: im following this guide: https://ask.fedoraproject.org/t/laptops-trackpad-not-always-recognized/9760/4 to make one but i get a "failed to enable unit: access denied" when i enable it
[07:24:41] <cluelessperson> Straight up, the math is simple.    Imagine having a high paying job at $150,000 for 50 years, without paying ANY taxes or spending ANY of it.
[07:24:57] <cluelessperson> That's $7.5 Million.
[07:25:04] <Vol[m]> cluelessperson: that much i understand hahah
[07:25:06] <cluelessperson> And we're already in la la land.
[07:25:31] <cluelessperson> So say you invest $7.5 Million well, and get a huge return on investment.  $20, 30, 50 whatever, that's incredible.
[07:25:58] *** nekobit is now known as swagneko
[07:26:00] <cluelessperson> We've basically invented a ridiculous scenario, without taxes, without spending, for 50 years of your life.

[07:26:15] <cluelessperson> and you STILL haven't reached $100 Million yet.

[10:55:17] <hexnewbie> And ‘to utf8’ can mean ‘to cp1252’ for anyone who wants to run xfig without fuse-convmvfs, or is hell bent on using non-utf8 encoding.

[11:03:59] <theos> everytime i will open it, moisture will get inside. so i am thinking of storing it in 100gm bottles. this way, i will only open 1 bottle at a time.
[11:06:37] <theos> its color toner. which is twice as costly as black. so i want to keep it safe. i see people using hdpe bottle for some reason and never a pet bottle. i got lots of pet bottles which i can use.
[11:06:40] <hexnewbie> Be sure to use gloves, N95 mask, and do it outside of your house, especially outside of any sleeping, work and eat areas.
[11:07:53] <theos> maybe i can use pet bottles too and put silica sachets in each bottle :>
[11:08:37] <theos> do you think it is a good idea ^^
[11:11:17] <hexnewbie> You can re-seal the original bags (non-airtight), then put them in a airtight container, with the silica gel in it. Not sure if that's good for the toner (it does not sound worse, at least), but you will deal with less toner particles in the air as move it from place to place multiple times.

[18:30:14] <bewees> What would you prefer for a server distribution between Fedora Server and Alpine? Iam a bit worried about Alpine using musl instead of glibc in regards of package compatibilities, also Iam not sure if Alpine has as many supported packages as Fedora
[18:30:15] <lopid> just give us the url that asks for credit card details, and move on
[18:30:33] <rascul> bewees are those the only options?
[18:30:39] <bewees> rascul: Yeah :-)
[18:31:01] <paule32> i like the old good debian
[18:31:08] <rascul> i wouldn't pick fedora in general for servers, and alpine i would only pick for certain use cases
[18:31:25] <lopid> alpine, bewees
[18:31:30] <HEX0> there's red star linux. but all it really does is fingerprint everything
[18:31:38] <Khaytsus> CentOS for machines without monitors, Fedora for machines with monitors.

[18:32:07] <rascul> centos is silly now
[18:32:09] <bewees> rascul: But Iam nevertheless curious which distro you would recommend besides these two. I distanced myself from debian and CentOS as I heard there's a CVE mess and a rolling releases' upstream might fix some issues by refactoring than relying on the developer to file a CVE, and the maintainer to quickly rebuild and distribute it
[18:32:31] <Khaytsus> rascul: Yeah, some alternative to CentOS, haven't looked into it yet as it doesn't affect me just yet
[18:32:37] <rascul> bewees why are those the only options?
[18:32:40] <bewees> lopid: Why would you prefer alpine over fedora? Better release cycle and good package manager?
[18:32:46] <lopid> kiss
[18:32:49] <Khaytsus> rascul: I'll let the ground shake a bit more on that one, I have a few years.
[18:32:52] <bewees> mhmm
[18:33:10] <lopid> and no systemd
[18:33:18] <rascul> Khaytsus yep wait and see what fills the spot
[18:35:26] <Khaytsus> Fedora has a 13 month lifecycle..  For _me_ I don't want to do a major upgrade to a server yearly.
