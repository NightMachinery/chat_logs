[01:47:13] <clemens3> and elisp should work just fine for basic stuff, i hope
[01:47:22] <euouae> You can hack emacs using guile and guile is better than elisp
[01:47:26] <clemens3> yeah, but why
[01:47:42] <clemens3> well, marketing says so
[01:47:45] <euouae> guile is a good language
[01:47:57] <clemens3> but why is elisp wrong for printing hello world
[01:48:12] <clemens3> i don't think so, at least after i learned the right function
[01:48:20] <euouae> If you learn guile you can transfer your knowledge to e.g. guix or other gnu applications
[01:48:27] <euouae> also guile is a serious language 
[01:48:35] <clemens3> if i learn elisp, i still can transfer it to emacs

[03:38:34] *** Joins: VincentVega (~user@212.97.1.105)
[03:40:11] <bpalmer> that said, you could probably have the cli pass over a file descriptor via unix domain socket which the daemon writes to.

[03:51:37] <Common-Lisp> bpalmer: does ssh not use the system dns?
[03:51:48] <Common-Lisp> like, can dig see things that ssh can't?
[03:51:49] <johnjaye> idk how it works on windows. you just enable ssh in the control panel and then you have the command
[03:51:58] <johnjaye> what does ssh agent control?
[03:52:16] <johnjaye> does the emacs shell have to know about it?
[03:52:23] <Common-Lisp> wait, you're on Windows?
[03:52:38] <johnjaye> yeah i should verify this on linux or bsd as well
[03:52:41] <bpalmer> I wasn't sure at what level punycode was implemented.
[03:52:49] <johnjaye> now that i think about it. i thought it was an emacs issue but it could be windows
[03:53:13] <Common-Lisp> bpalmer: huh, that's a good question 
[03:53:16] <Common-Lisp> I'm curious now too 
[03:53:37] <johnjaye> ssh has many mysteries

[12:22:31] <intothewild> hi i'm trying to develop something with transient but it's so abstract; is there a nice package using it so I can learn from examples - something simpler than magit
[12:22:52] <wasamasa> it's supposedly used in emacs itself
[12:24:49] <intothewild> wasamasa: it's part of emacs but I don't see any package using it

[12:25:15] <contrapunctus> _transient_ is a part of Emacs?!
[12:25:15] <twb> intothewild: "with transient" ?
[12:25:28] <s-liao> what is that?
[12:25:40] <contrapunctus> intothewild: you could search GitHub for Elisp repos containing "transient"...
[12:25:53] <wasamasa> emoji.el uses it
[12:26:27] <contrapunctus> wow, it really is part of Emacs. gosh!
[12:26:30] <wasamasa> well, there's more things using that term
[12:26:35] <wasamasa> like transient-mark-mode
[12:26:38] <wasamasa> or transient keymaps
[12:26:46] <wasamasa> I searched for (require 'transient)

[12:34:45] <intothewild> Basically i want to build a transient UI for calc

[12:35:56] <intothewild> it's a nice exercise and will hopefully popularize calc which is very under appreciated; it's amazing, one of Emacs selling points IMHO

[14:55:55] <contrapunctus> So...the linter I was writing has multiple backends, implemented as CLOS/EIEIO objects. To use it non-interactively (although I don't see that ever happening, TBH) you'd have to call it from the command line...wouldn't it be a pain to have to pass an object on the command line? :\ Surely there's a better way... 🤔️

[23:39:06] <theothornhill> does it though?
