So now the problem is that i've got a bunch of keymaps like "<D-j>" (where "D" is the modifier-key "command" on mac keyboards), and terminal emulators typically intercept those uses of <command> (instead of forwarding them to neovim somehow, which is what i want).   Can

[07:14:25] <james_widman[m]> Also, certain keybindings are so ergonomic that i end up using the same input for both the terminal and also for the nvim gui app.  But of course those keybindings mean different things, because they're not defined in the same application.

[15:06:55] <arch-angel> so for C++, does anyone know any plugins or commands that will autocomplete the '<' and '>' for certain parts of the code?
[15:07:13] <arch-angel> like when it's a comparison don't autocomplete, but if it's something like a std::vector then autocomplete it
[15:07:39] <MrElendig> the lsp does a half decent job of that
[15:07:53] <arch-angel> as far as I know, I think it's pretty possible with nvim-autopairs and nvim-treesitter but I don't have much experience in writing lua
[15:08:46] <arch-angel> MrElendig, which lsp?
[15:09:44] <MrElendig> people actually use others than clangd?
[15:10:57] <arch-angel> well I use YouCompleteMe, so I have no idea what you're talking about
[15:11:08] <arch-angel> I was thinking of switching to coc.nvim, but it seemed like a very big pain

[15:12:39] <arch-angel> complete template parameters

[15:13:36] <puremouron> you can get the snapshot builds from clangd's github linked from clangd.llvm.org
[15:13:48] <puremouron> if you point ycm at it using `g:ycm_clangd_binary_path` it might work
[15:14:24] <puremouron> i was joking about 'terrible idea' ; you said you wre thinking of switching to a competing completion plugin :)
[15:14:28] <arch-angel> well since I'm using neovim, should I use YCM, or migrate to coc.nvim?
[15:14:34] <puremouron> (i'm the maintainer of YCM in case you don't know)
[15:14:45] <arch-angel> or is there a YCM alternative for nvim lol
[15:15:03] <puremouron> oh right, yeah. signature help is not supported in neovim with YCM due to the difference in API
[15:16:03] *** Joins: jabster28_ (~jabster28@81.111.217.63)
[15:22:14] <arch-angel> puremouron, i heard people say that you know plugins written in vim script is way slower than ones written in lua, so I'm pretty curious, is it actually true or not
[15:22:54] <arch-angel> and also, I run on Arch, so my clangd binary is probably the latest release
[15:23:00] <arch-angel> other than the -git build
[15:23:55] <puremouron> erm, there's a lot to chew on there, but YCM uses a bundled veresion of clangd usually
[15:24:09] <arch-angel> ahhhh
[15:24:11] <arch-angel> i see i see
[15:24:17] <puremouron> so unless you do what i said, you'll probably be using clangd 11. but anyway like i said, there's no signature help in YCM in neovim, so it's probably not going to make a big difference
[15:24:20] <arch-angel> my clangd is 13.something
[15:27:27] <puremouron> regarding vimscript/python/tcl/javascript/lua/rust/c++. yawn, it's usually a boring language fetish argument that i'm not interested in.in neovim, then lua probably has better runtime peformance for certain things than other things, but i have not done any benchmarking of YCM, which has a minimal vimscript layer. i do know that the remote python interface implementation in lua does add some overhead that we have previously benchmarked as
[15:27:27] <puremouron> noticable in some cases.

[15:28:29] <clason[m]> Definitely fake news, at least in this generality. Please don't spread FUD.
[15:29:02] <kylo252[m]> puremouron: how much overhead is involved in expanding snippets? since it's not really something that's supported in core
[15:29:18] <puremouron> it's fair to say that YCM is better in vim than it is in neovim so no hard feelings if you do choose to use a different plugin for functional reasons. if you choose to use one for performance reasons, i'd like to know about it and see (or be able to produce) benchmarks to repro and fix
[15:29:29] <puremouron> kylo252[m]: WDYM? YCM doesn't support snippets
[15:29:48] <puremouron> (well my fork of it does, but there's little chance that will ever be merged to master)

[15:31:36] <kylo252[m]> I'm not sure about clangd in this regard, but jsonls does generate some sort of snippet based on schemas, and these don't work all that well natively in neovim
[15:31:56] <arch-angel> to be frank, the coc.nvim sample configuration looks as long as my current init.vim... so I don't think i'll be considering using coc.nvim unless YCM breaks on nvim
[15:32:04] <clason[m]> wdym "natively in Neovim"
[15:32:04] <kylo252[m]> you need a snippet "manager" for them, is what I mean
[15:32:05] <clason[m]> Neovim does not have snippet support, so they don't work at all
[15:32:31] <clason[m]>  * Neovim does not have built-in snippet support, so they don't work at all
[15:32:31] <puremouron> kylo252: right, you are referring to snippet completions, as produced by the json language server.
[15:32:38] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: there are some snippet modules here and there, so I didn't want to say it doesn't support it outright :)
[15:33:06] <clason[m]> there are snippet plugins
[15:33:06] <puremouron> actually 2 things: 1) json language server breaches the LSP by only providing snippets, 2) i actually implemented snippets in my fork of YCM because of this
[15:33:06] <clason[m]> and these work perfectly fine, also with LSP
[15:33:19] <puremouron> unfortunately, my implementation basically relies on UltiSnips to do the snippet expansion
[15:33:28] <clason[m]> so you need to be much more precise about "natively in Neovim"
[15:34:13] <puremouron> so in terms of performance: i don't know what the overhead is, but it's likely very large by comparison to built-in completion. in terms of complexity: relying on ultisnips is easy, but doing it fully/properly is a lot of work, which is why we don't support it
[15:35:05] <kylo252[m]> puremouron: do you mean the only completion support it has is snippet based? still snippets are in the protocol either way
[15:35:11] <arch-angel> does anyone know where I can find coc.nvim extensions?
[15:35:23] <arch-angel> I can't even find one using Google
[15:35:31] <puremouron> snippets are optional in the protocol, protected by a client capability
[15:35:32] <arch-angel> is it hidden in some fancy command or something
[15:35:38] <puremouron> JSON language server ignores the capability
[15:35:59] <clason[m]> probably on the CoC website: https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions

[19:18:03] <clason[m]> then you can't use that function
[19:18:13] <clason[m]> the `fun` argument only takes a Lua function
[19:19:52] <wsdjegWangShidon> and why I get `E117: Unknown function: nvim_buf_call`
[19:20:23] <wsdjegWangShidon> but there is `:h nvim_buf_call()` in doc
[19:20:40] <SeanDewar[m]> nvim_buf_call isn't available from Vimscript
[19:21:13] <wsdjegWangShidon> This should be document in doc.
[19:21:17] <wsdjegWangShidon> s/document/documented/
[19:21:42] <clason[m]> yes, that is a known limitation of the doc generation script
[19:22:01] <clason[m]> someone just has to Do The Work
[19:22:02] <wsdjegWangShidon> thanks.
[19:22:15] <clason[m]> (but the docs already say that `fun` is only available from Lua, which could have tipped you off)
[19:22:26] <SeanDewar[m]> would be nice if there was a buf_execute function for Vim script tbh
[19:22:31] <wsdjegWangShidon> and What I want is just to run `:w` on other buffer, without switching buffers.
[19:22:32] <SeanDewar[m]> iirc there's only win_execute
[19:22:41] <wsdjegWangShidon> is that possible in neovim
[19:23:22] <wsdjegWangShidon> I have opened issue in vim's repo https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/9698
[19:24:01] <SeanDewar[m]> hmm, the way nvim does it is by calling it in the context of the autocommand window viewing the requested buffer
[19:25:02] <SeanDewar[m]> btw is there anything stopping you from just using a lua heredoc or something to use nvim_buf_call?
[19:25:45] <wsdjegWangShidon> I will have a try with lua function.
[19:26:39] <wsdjegWangShidon> I have added a new feature to spacevim, I hope it work well in both neovim and vim.
