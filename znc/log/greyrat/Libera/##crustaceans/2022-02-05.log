[00:02:41] <gerikson> mardown is life
[00:02:46] <riv> we finally sorted out the lack-of-standardization mess
[00:03:37] <gerikson> these are people who consider balancing quotes too hard
[00:03:46] <imode> what.
[00:04:15] <imode> have they.. tried writing a function to do that?
[00:04:39] <riv> personally I can't stand things that turn " into [one of the two unicode slanty quotes]
[00:04:51] <riv> i had to disable thigs on my wiki because it was fucking things up
[00:05:15] <imode> yeah that's infuriating.
[00:05:25] <riv> it's nice in LaTeX output
[00:05:29] <riv> to have good quotation marks
[00:06:12] <gerikson> not saying it's not a hard problem
[00:06:13] <riv> but it's mixing model and view, if you substitute the actual codepoint for slanty quote, just to display it nicer
[00:06:29] <riv> also there's the assumption that the user input actually has matching quotes
[00:07:46] <imode> gerikson: are we talking about detecting a balanced quote string here?
[00:07:49] <gerikson> I just use a Perl script (by John Gruber) that does the Right Thing(tm) for USanian quotes
[00:07:57] <gerikson> well not really
[00:08:33] <gerikson> here's a reply to the original, I agree with it for the most part, but I also think that just giving up and going straight quotes is a cop-out gemini://idiomdrottning.org/re-skeumorphic-smart-quotes

[00:08:34] <buttsbot> https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/idiomdrottning.org/re-skeumorphic-smart-quotes
[00:08:50] <gerikson> `` If they weren’t separate characters, if they just DISPLAYED as smart quotes but were treated under the hood as straight quotes, that would be fine!''
[00:09:01] <imode> oh.
[00:09:42] <imode> I understand now.
[00:09:43] <imode> meh.
[00:09:46] <riv> It is true
[00:10:18] <imode> just go with regular quotes.
[00:12:05] <imode> oh thank god, washington is finally downtrending for its cases.
[00:12:14] <imode> just barely, but downtrending.
[00:14:29] <gerikson> I use `` '' for "real" quotes
[00:14:37] <manicennui> Financial analysts Taiki Morita and Nick Schmitz recently looked at all 268,350 mergers in CompuStat from 2000-2021, and found that “corporate acquirers in the US generally tended to underperform the market. And the bigger the deal, the worse the returns. The firms in the 10th decile generated a -23% premium relative to the market in the subsequent year.”
[00:14:43] <gerikson> I started doing it just because Info does, but it's a TeX thing
[00:14:54] <riv> now that's a really good solution that I like
[00:14:58] <gerikson> lol manicennui
[00:15:05] <riv> you can use `` and '' as shorthand for the unicode slanted quotes
[00:15:18] <riv> but converting " to unicode quotes has problems
[00:16:33] <gerikson> then of course you have the issue that US/UK is the 66-99 pairing, while German is 99-66, (with the opening being at the bottom of the text), and Swedish is 99-99
[00:16:52] <gerikson> and Swedish has the quote-dash in most prose too
[00:17:27] <gerikson> manicennui: megamergers mostly look like ego-boosting to me , for CEOs
[00:17:39] <manicennui> gerikson: It boosts their wallets.
[00:17:43] <manicennui> That's really it.
[00:17:49] <manicennui> Certain people make a fuckton off of mergers.
[00:18:04] <manicennui> Those people just don't happen to be their customers, the average shareholder, employees...
[00:20:09] <gwozniak> I can't remember ever hearing about a megamerger that did well.  Admittedly, I don't pay a lot of attention to them, though
[00:21:19] <gwozniak> Well, now that I think about it, the company I work for bought Atmel about 5 years ago.  I don't know how that is perceived, to be honest

[00:22:16] <manicennui> Just utter nonsense.
[00:23:22] <manicennui> They basically stripped a bunch of shit, reduced competition, and they'll saddle the spinoff with debt.
[00:23:36] <manicennui> But some executives made huge bonuses.

[00:35:47] <manicennui> One key player is CVS, which is so big its various lines of business touch one out of every three Americans. CVS is a massive pharmacy chain, but it generates its real profits through its pharmacy benefits management business, which is a middleman in the medical supply chain. It also owns Aetna, one of the largest health insurers in America.
[00:40:06] <bontaq> didn't know they own aetna, interesting
[00:40:06] <manicennui> My employer has been acquiring quite a bit lately. We did a lot better during the pandemic than some of our competitors.
[00:40:12] <manicennui> bontaq: Same.
[00:40:29] <manicennui> I don't think health insurance companies should own any other kind of company, or be owned by any other kind of company.
[00:40:40] <manicennui> At least not if that other company is also in healthcare.
[00:40:48] <manicennui> Huge conflicts of interest.
[00:41:00] <manicennui> People don't know that UHG owns all kinds of shit, including immediate care centers.
[00:42:26] <manicennui> CVS has their clinics, obviously has pharmacies, and owns an insurance company.
[00:42:31] <manicennui> No conflict there!

[00:44:23] <gwozniak> well shucks
[00:44:26] <manicennui> People still use webex?
[00:45:12] <gwozniak> A decent contingent of our company still does.  I think clients that the sales/field engineers talk to don't want to switch...?  I don't know
[00:45:28] <gwozniak> Internally, we pretty much use Teams for everything now
[00:45:36] <manicennui> I saw recently that Citrix was acquired. I wonder who still uses their software.
[00:46:00] <gwozniak> I have a system preferences pane installed for that and have never used it
[00:46:17] <gwozniak> If I do have to use it, I'll know something is wrong
[00:46:33] <manicennui> So basically your employer uses all of this stuff. =P
[00:47:42] <gwozniak> I know the purchasing system was recently changed to be much better than it used to be.  It was some BaaN thing before, I think.
[00:48:22] <gwozniak> It's now some kind of internal website and everyone who used the old one says this new one is considerably better
[00:48:25] <manicennui> Do you also use HP Quality Center?
[00:48:32] <gwozniak> Thankfully, no
[00:48:54] <gwozniak> But I did have to use that for a while at... Comcast or RIM.  I can't remember now
[00:49:00] <manicennui> Maybe some Rational Rose
[00:49:07] <gwozniak> But wow, HPQC was utter garbage
[00:49:10] <manicennui> My last employer used HPQC
[00:49:39] <manicennui> Manage your software's quality with one of the lowest quality pieces of commercial software. Makes total sense.
[00:49:40] <gwozniak> It was Comcast
[00:50:00] <gwozniak> It had a version control system that makes RCS look like Git
[00:50:54] <gwozniak> As in, it will make you want to use RCS instead of whatever the fuck came with HPQC
[00:51:23] <manicennui> At the last company I worked at there was a team of three people who investigated what to use instead of VSS. One of them wanted to use ClearCase, but they settled on Perforce.
[00:51:29] <manicennui> This was after git was already huge.
[00:51:43] <manicennui> A bunch of people were using the git to perforce thing.
[00:52:13] <prussian> that sounds, backwards.
[00:52:20] <manicennui> Perforce was also too complicated for about half the people there. They couldn't handle anything more complicated than VSS with exclusive checkout.
[00:52:38] <gwozniak> I.... know some devs like that now
[00:54:14] <manicennui> We have some devs who manage to screw up their git branches once in a while, but people more or less get it.
[00:54:31] <gwozniak> I used Rational Team Concert at IBM.  It was actually capable, but had a shittier interface than Git.  The bug tracker was awful, though
[00:55:18] <gwozniak> I think we deal with it well because we have a very low number of commits and the areas of code that we are working on generally don't overlap
[00:56:16] <gwozniak> The RTC bug tracker didn't do formatting of code in comments, so people would paste log output and it would auto transform some things to smileys
[00:56:30] <gwozniak> I missed some important information because of that

[00:59:51] <gwozniak> Whatever was before RTC at IBM used something based on SCCS and demanded exclusive access to files
[01:00:02] <gwozniak> It was used for many, many years
[01:06:53] <gwozniak> Where I currently work, an extensive analysis was done about 10 years ago to pick a different VCS and they went with Fossil

[01:08:30] <manicennui> Fossil is interesting.
[01:08:45] <manicennui> I definitely think there should be more than one common option.

[01:50:26] <gwozniak> Many of us would love to write our own linker, but that'll be a fair bit of work
[01:50:43] <prussian> or alts like gold ld don't do everything gnu ld does?
[01:50:56] <gwozniak> We could use gold
[01:50:59] <prussian> how many one-off linkers are there nowadays?
[01:51:44] <gwozniak> Custom linkers are reasonably common in the embedded world.  IAR, Green Hills, Segger... they all have their own
[01:51:50] <gwozniak> There are probably more

[07:09:47] <imode> huh. is tarsnap $0.25/GB per month?
[07:10:03] <imode> if so that's pretty significant.
[07:29:16] <manicennui> Yeah, but he seems to claim that his deduplication technique significantly reduces the actual size stored.
[07:30:48] <manicennui> "This server has almost three years' worth of hourly snapshots, which add up to a total of 96,492 GB. But after duplicate blocks of data are removed (or more precisely, only stored once), that drops to 56.1 GB, which is then compressed to 15.8 GB — an amount which costs $3.95/month to store."
[07:32:19] <manicennui> I think the question becomes how you access a backed up directory or something.
[07:32:27] <manicennui> Do you have to download the entire thing and decompress it somewhere?
[07:46:23] <imode> so, wait, what's their pricing model, exactly? do you pay for the cumulative storage?
[07:46:43] <imode> because if I have 6TiB of data to store in tarsnap and don't submit hourly updates (or even yearly ones, it might as well be in cold storage)..
[07:46:49] <imode> that'll cost >$1k/mo to store.
[07:50:33] <manicennui> I think it's more like your 6TB isn't actually 6TB once deduped and compressed.
[08:11:26] <imode> if I'm archiving disk images that's hard.
[08:11:47] <manicennui> I'm sure he's on IRC somewhere.

[10:04:14] <manicennui> That seems scummy.
[10:04:19] <manicennui> Why not refund a failed campaign?
[10:04:29] <manicennui> Why do people have to ask for it?

[17:26:43] <companion_cube> I haven't followed at all manicennui, the truckers are protesting in Ottawa now?
[17:27:02] <Xe> companion_cube: it's less a protest now and more an illegal occupation
[17:27:45] <companion_cube> I see
[17:27:52] <companion_cube> and as always, they're just allowed to do that, heh?
[17:29:36] <Xe> the cops have been taking action against the counter protestors and citizens have filed a class action lawsuit for the 7 straight days of nonstop honking
[17:32:32] <companion_cube> wow…
[17:32:40] <Xe> also
[17:32:48] <Xe> the protestors brought their kids
[17:33:22] <Xe> and the protestors have guns
[17:36:06] <companion_cube> oh, of course they do.

[23:41:30] <imode> beautiful creature.
[23:42:50] <manicennui> Not as beautiful as a crypto mining warehouse.
[23:43:00] <manicennui> We need more humans.
[23:57:34] <imode> a "tree city" is a useless fucking label.
[23:58:02] <imode> most of the tree cities out here have eradicated all of their old growth, forests and general wildlife.
[23:58:17] <imode> the requirements for a "tree city" are absurdly low.
[23:58:44] <manicennui> It's nice having trees right outside my window, but it's more in contrast to the rest of this concrete paradise.
[23:58:57] <imode> you're not required to have reserved forestlands, preserved wildlife areas, a minimum green cover, etc.
[23:59:00] <manicennui> I remember some architect calling what we do in cities as "nature bandaids".
[23:59:42] <imode> to be a tree city, you need to have a tree board/department, some community ordinance for tree care, a community forestry program and an arbor day observance.
[23:59:48] <manicennui> I don't think you really realize the difference unless you experience a real forest, which many people in the US never do now.
[23:59:49] <imode> there's nothing saying "preserve what we have currently".
[23:59:52] <imode> yeah.
[23:59:57] <imode> I used to live near and in real forests.
