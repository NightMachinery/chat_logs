[18:06:29] <hayley> Just putting out the idea again, couldn't we treat any shared state as another actor in some supervisor tree/link graph/etc? One can say that e.g. GETHASH on a concurrent hash table is a prematurely optimized message send.
[18:08:19] <hayley> Another bad idea: to get your links, make another box object where unboxing makes the thread link to the object. But I don't think it'd be highly necessary in my own code as I don't write actors which pull non-constant state.

[19:51:11] <sm2n> hayley, re: shared state as actors, termite scheme did exactly this if I recall correctly
[19:51:27] <sm2n> in fact they implemented all mutable state on top of actors

[20:48:35] <clothespin> that is fortunate

[21:22:57] <gilberth> What's wrong with your Emacs?
[21:23:45] <clothespin> i only use 1% of it
[21:24:00] <gilberth> And? Why is that a problem?
[21:24:07] <clothespin> and i have been using it for 20 years
[21:24:36] <clothespin> maybe somebody has productivity tips which would help me
[21:25:52] <gilberth> I use Emacs for about 30 years now, and there are still new commands, I discover. Though I don't miss most of them.
[21:31:35] <gilberth> What I miss though is the old HTML-mode, the new one is broken beyond repair. But then most modes are broken.
