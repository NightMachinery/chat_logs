[12:13:10] <jim> serafeim, hi... I wonder if you could give me a quick hand: in a template, I have some_list in the context, and {% for o in some_list %} in here, I'd like to get dir(o) {% endfor o %}
[12:13:59] <jim> I know I can't do that in DTL, and it looks like I can't do it in python either
[12:14:23] <jim> because the loop is in the template, not in python
[12:14:54] <jim> tried o.dir, that didn't work

[12:15:17] <serafeim> for debug ?
[12:15:58] <jim> yeah, and I'm also curious what a DTL loop index has as attributes
[12:16:37] <jim> (never gonna use the dir in the actual code0

[12:18:32] <serafeim> You'll do the debug in your view, not your template. Follow this: https://spapas.github.io/2016/06/07/django-werkzeug-debugger/
[12:19:29] <serafeim> And. if you *really* want for some reason to run `dir(o)` in a template you'll need to add a template tag or filter. so you'll run either `{% dir_tag o %}` or `{{ o|dir_filter }}`
[12:20:01] <jim> let me try that

[12:22:22] <jim> didn't like dir_tag inside for...endfor
[12:22:43] <serafeim> jim: use the template tag/filter.
[12:22:43] <jim> let's see if the filter would work
[12:22:49] <serafeim> you need to *ADD* the fitler
[12:23:45] <nikitagupta> I have one django application running on http://localhost:8081 but i need to run it over https://locahost:8081
[12:23:45] <nikitagupta> I have generated the ssl cert with command openssl but dont know how to inform django where my certs are kept.
[12:23:46] <nikitagupta> i have modified settings.py like:
[12:23:46] <nikitagupta> SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
[12:23:47] <nikitagupta> SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
[12:23:47] <nikitagupta> CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
[12:23:48] <nikitagupta> so its redirecting to https but i think since ssl certs are not configured, the app is not accessible.
[12:23:48] <nikitagupta> I did find some help on google for configuring ssl certs into httpd.conf but thats over virtualhost.
[12:23:49] <nikitagupta> My machine has default python2.7 and I have kept the binaries of python3.9 inside a directory and run my django application using this binary.
[12:23:49] <nikitagupta> I need your help for configuring ssl certs into django application.
[12:24:48] <jim> I think an ssl cert is configured into the web server you use
[12:25:16] <serafeim> nikitagupta: django will not use your ssl cert because it aint' a web server
[12:25:18] <nikitagupta> I am using apache.
[12:26:11] <serafeim> nikitagupta: if you use apache then you'll configure apache to use your ssl cert (which is not relative to this channel) and then reverse proxy through apache to your django app. *or* use mod_wsgi however i don't recommend it
[12:27:10] <jim> serafeim, by "add the filter" do you mean some kind of registering of a new filter?
[12:27:31] <serafeim> jim: yes https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/custom-template-tags/
[12:28:48] <nikitagupta> I understand configuring httpd is not related to this channel. But I need to configure specific to Django.
[12:28:49] <nikitagupta> I tried to modify httpd.conf as:
[12:28:49] <nikitagupta> WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/django/application/wsgi.py
[12:28:50] <nikitagupta> #WSGIPythonHome /python3.9
[12:28:50] <nikitagupta> WSGIPythonPath /path/to/django/application:/python3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages

[12:28:53] <nikitagupta> but not sure about WSGIPythonPath or WSGIPythonHome
[12:29:50] <jim> nikitagupta, maybe some don't like pasting... I dunno, but if that's the case, howbout this: if you have nc installed, you can pastebin the output of an arbitrary command, for example ls -CF if you run it like this: ls -CF | nc termbin.com 9999
[12:30:47] <jim> serafeim, ok, I have confusing questions right now, I'll read your link first
[12:32:10] <serafeim> nikitagupta: so you want to use mod_wsgi. i have like 10 years since i used this so i can't help you

[12:44:23] <serafeim> i don't recommend using mod_wsgi.
[12:44:35] <serafeim> i recommend using nginx to reverse proxy to gunicorn/django
[12:46:30] <yanchai> serafeim: what's in mod_wsgi? i kinda use it now in my production environment and same i encounter with the ssl certs
[12:46:53] <serafeim> yanchai: it uses apache.
[12:47:25] <yanchai> serafeim: is it not a good server? im confused sorry to ask
[12:47:52] <yanchai> serafeim: anyway, thanks for the tip ill read on to the docs and change my server to gunicorn then
[12:47:58] <serafeim> yanchai: see here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/
[12:48:08] <yanchai> thanks mate
[12:48:31] <serafeim> yanchai: the thing is that you should use apache as a last resort; i.e if you can't run a different web server
[12:48:55] <yanchai> serafeim: oh ok then
[12:50:07] <serafeim> that's my personal opinion
[12:50:18] <serafeim> also notice that i've got apps from 2011 that run on mod_wsgi with no problems
[12:50:47] <yanchai> now i am more confused hahaha
[12:51:18] <yanchai> as a starter to django i would prefer 1 so i have to pick and focus on which one
[12:51:43] <yanchai> so ill try to read on the docs and change my server then
[12:52:06] <yanchai> is ngix able to do virtual host?

[12:54:57] <serafeim> np
[12:55:09] <yanchai> also i was thinking of ngix for load balancer?
[12:55:28] <serafeim> yanchai: yes nginx can do load balancing but why would you need a load balancer ?
[12:55:37] <serafeim> are you going to run 2 django app servers ?
[12:56:33] <yanchai> for what i understood load balancer is good for server traffic control?
[12:57:06] <yanchai> like 2 server 1 app? is this correct?
[12:57:12] <serafeim> yanchai: a load balancer is used if you have multiple application servers and want to share the traffic
[12:57:50] <yanchai> i thought it splits traffic into parts

[16:34:52] <sixpiece> I believe so
[16:35:02] <sixpiece> I mean I don't get that part this way they phrase it
[16:35:15] <sixpiece> it's not like I load c++ and I create a venv or whatever
[16:35:32] <sixpiece> or php I don't remember doing a venv in php or anything of the like or java
[16:35:42] *** audiobirb is now known as audio
[16:35:58] <Lartza> Maybe talk me through what you did
[16:36:12] <Lartza> python3 -m venv mynewvenvfoldername I assume at first
[16:37:02] <sixpiece> sure I visited djangoproject.com , installed python, installed django through some of the steps, I am not sure I can back trace all of them , but something to the effect of pkg install python39 whatever and somehow 3.7 is installed , creating a venv somehow of some sort
[16:37:26] <sixpiece> something like that I don't remember exactly
[16:37:42] <Lartza> Well do you have a venv folder now in front of you?
[16:38:05] <Lartza> And are you on BSD?
[16:38:25] <sixpiece> yes that is correct
[16:38:47] <sixpiece> Berkeley California Systems
[16:38:52] <Lartza> So you should do "source myvenvfolder/bin/activate"
[16:38:57] <Lartza> After creating the venv
[16:39:15] <sixpiece> source not found
[16:40:00] <Lartza> Are you not using bash?
[16:40:29] <sixpiece> I think so not sure
[16:41:11] <Lartza> ps -p $$
[16:41:34] <sixpiece> 32626  0  Ss   0:00.05 -sh (sh)
[16:42:09] <Lartza> ". myvenvfolder/bin/activate" but I'm not sure how reliable the activate script is under sh

[16:42:37] <sixpiece> how do I know what myenvfolder is?
[16:42:43] <sixpiece> or I can just use it as it is?
[16:43:04] <Lartza> It's the one you created
[16:43:13] <Lartza> with "python -m venv foldername"
[16:44:04] <sixpiece> ok I think I did it
[16:44:12] <sixpiece> . /vue-project
[16:44:45] <Lartza> You probably don't want that to be your venv folder, and you are not calling the activate script like that
[16:44:58] <Lartza> /vue-project/venv/bin/activate sounds like a more reasonable folder
[16:45:04] <Lartza> *target
[16:45:42] <sixpiece> so I should do the python -m venv foldername again?
[16:46:48] <sixpiece> k now that's done
[16:46:55] <Lartza> It should be a folder that only the venv is in yeah, don't put things inside it
[16:47:01] <Lartza> I usually have a venv folder inside my project folder
[16:47:05] <Lartza> And then gitignored
[16:47:17] <sixpiece> I thought it was like that but who konws
[16:47:53] <sixpiece> probably not
[16:47:56] <sixpiece> thank you
[16:47:57] <Lartza> So now call the activate script with the dot and you should now be using that venv, instead of your system python
[16:48:13] <Lartza> And then you can pip install your project dependencies in that venv
[16:48:46] <Lartza> You named C++, php and java which sure are maybe not too similar to this but javascript definitely is with node modules per-project

[16:52:52] <sixpiece> that's built with node js
[16:53:11] <sixpiece> thanks what do I do now this isn't easy
[16:57:14] <sixpiece> I kind of get the idea something to activate the venv

[16:57:23] <sixpiece> something like that
[16:57:28] <sixpiece> kickstart the server?
[16:58:13] <Lartza> No, venv is almost like your node_modules folder
[16:58:23] <Lartza> Do you see the venv is now activated?
