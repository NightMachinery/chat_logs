Now that we have an assembler, we have all the key tools in hand to move the META and SPL complex. Although we will have to do a substantial amount of 8086 assembly code to move the package, when we're done we'll control the compiler, and that allows us to take advantage of floating

[00:12:45] <shawwwn> dbohdan2: I think it has a lisp engine, but the program itself was probably composed of lower level parts
[00:13:18] <shawwwn> I never looked into it, but I recall autocad being one of the big lisp systems of ye olden days
[00:13:21] <dbohdan2> shawwwn: I got the same impression.  (I don't do CAD, though.)
[00:13:58] <shawwwn> Why not? It’s fun
[00:14:00] <gwern> once you have lisp as an extension, wouldn't surprise me if your developers gravitate to doing everything in that instead of the SPL or C++ rewrite thereof

[02:55:13] <Betawolf> right, but all the other forms of government also throw up this stuff
[02:55:29] <meowcat> well yes. but it ain't like monarchs are somehow un-PC
[02:55:40] <meowcat> i mean, ain't nobody more PC than north korea right now
[02:56:11] <meowcat> and they're the only nuclear(kinda) monarchy

[07:36:14] <gwern> another anecdote, since I'm reading about obesity now - my aunts were discussing a girl they knew in highschool in the late 60s or so, who was ostracized for being 'fat'. she wasn't 'fat' in the sense you are thinking of, they emphasize, by current standards, she was barely 'plump'. but everyone thought she was really fat, possibly the fattest girl in school, and this little fattie couldn't...
[07:36:20] <gwern> ...get a boyfriend until she went to college, at which point she dragged him around town to everything she could just to show off her real live actual boyfriend (and married him a year or two later, which ended a year later in divorce). they note that the girls in the highschools they work out, a large fraction are substantially fatter than this girl was, including many not called 'fat' at...
[07:36:24] <milanandreew> I take no responsibility for anything my computer says of its own accord
[07:36:26] <gwern> ...all. this gives you a sense of how things have shifted over the past half-century
[07:36:44] <gwern> ('not even plump, really, but curvy, with a round face that made her look fatter' one amended)
[07:37:10] <Betawolf> there's probably always a penalty for being fattest, even if that's not fat.

[07:39:11] <rmmh> gwern: one of the funniest bits in that 'evolution of breasts' paper was the note that they asked men in some cultures aobut whether they found breasts attractive and they considered the question itself some bizarre perversion
[07:39:14] <gwern> (anyway, we looked at photos of her and her daughter, and the girl in question is now an old woman, and unsurprisingly, she's pretty damn fat by any standards now, having lived through said past halfcentury)
[07:39:20] <rmmh> "why would you care aobut milk glands?"
[07:39:42] <gwern> rmmh: yeah, I was surprised by that. boobs seemed pretty universal in western culture throughout history
[07:39:49] <rmmh> I posit that it's the clothing
[07:40:02] <rmmh> if you're a hunter-gatherer society where everyone is topless there's no intimacy from the chest

[10:59:16] <mst> saturn2: I suspect I had as much fun building that as I did playing things ;)
[11:02:37] <quanticle> Speaking of having fun building things, does anyone else remember DJGPP: http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/
[11:02:38] <Robomot> DJGPP
[11:02:46] <quanticle> I remember that was my first C compiler
[11:03:45] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: plays perfectly in dosbox with the zip file of mine I linked if you're ever bored enough
[11:04:09] <quanticle> Using RHIDE as my editor: http://www.rhide.com/
[11:04:09] <Robomot> Welcome to RHIDE
[11:06:48] <mst> oh for fuck's sakes
[11:07:35] <mst> tried to get wingco I and II on GOG but it's just crashing
[11:13:44] * mst puts keygen church back on
[11:14:30] <mst> quanticle: I learned on QBASIC and its built in editor
[11:14:37] <mst> well, plus BBC BASIC and RISC OS 3
[11:20:27] <quanticle> You know, that's been a long standing mystery for me
[11:20:42] <quanticle> The version of DOS that was on the first computer that I inherited from my parents did not have QBASIC
[11:20:59] <mst> quanticle: oh, yes, I stole mine from somewhere
[11:21:19] <rsaarelm> Holy shit I remember rhide.
[11:21:23] <quanticle> I was exploring on the very primitive world wide web, and people were telling me, "Oh, just run QBASIC.EXE," and I was like, "That isn't there, wtf are you on about?"
[11:21:32] <mst> quanticle: everybody had it cos we'd all stolen it from somewhere
[11:21:37] <quanticle> And that was how I got into C programming, lol
[11:21:48] <quanticle> Because I was too smooth-brained to steal QBASIC
[11:22:09] <mst> I'd already been learning BBC BASIC and ARM assembler
[11:22:16] <mst> so stealing QBASIC was just logical
[11:22:17] <mst> but yeah
[11:22:52] <mst> if you booted from a copies dos floppy from a friend it'd have qbasic
[11:23:12] <mst> people very easily forgot the official ones didn't
[11:23:33] <mst> anyway, computers are stupid and I'm going to bed
[11:27:40] <mjr> well you could do worse than getting into C instead of QBASIC by accident
[11:32:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> To this day I have never used BASIC
[11:32:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> My first programming language was C
[11:33:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Edited in emacs and compiled with gcc, like God intended)
[11:33:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, xemacs, to be precise. It was on an Irix box with whatever the heck graphical shell Irix had back then)
[11:34:06] <quanticle> Oh
[11:34:21] <quanticle> I was about to ask, "Emacs supported MacOS?"
[11:34:24] <quanticle> and the same for GCC
[11:34:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah this wasn't on my home box, it was at Columbia University
[11:35:17] <quanticle> If it were at home, I would have expected, "I learned to program C++ with CodeWarrior"
[11:35:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> They ran this like weekend "learn college level shit" program for highschoolers
[11:35:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I took the CS thing they offered
[11:36:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was cool. They had SGI O2s, whole labs of them
[11:36:17] <quanticle> Wooooooow
[11:36:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Labs, plural)
[11:36:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just dozens and dozens of O2
[11:36:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> s
[11:36:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> And we used them to write "Hello World" in C, lol
[11:36:51] <quanticle> Enough that they could spare a bunch to let high schoolers play with
[11:36:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[11:37:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gotta love absurdly rich private universities, eh
[11:37:21] <quanticle> s/private//
[11:37:35] <quanticle> I remember seeing some pretty absurd workstations at the University of Minnesota as well
[11:37:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah fair enough
[11:38:04] <quanticle> The U of M's tastes ran more towards Sun boxen, though
[11:38:12] <quanticle> Which aren't nearly as cool as SGI
[11:38:19] <quanticle> So I guess private universities have better taste
[11:38:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm

[11:38:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Look at that screenshot
[11:38:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that not clearly a Mac OS imitation
[11:39:59] <quanticle> Insofar as the entire Motif toolkit was a MacOS imitation, yes.
[11:40:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha, yeah
[11:40:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, question. Does anyone here remember a software package called MojoWorld, from a company called Pandromeda?
[11:41:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems like I'm the only one who remembers this thing, but it was SO COOL
[11:41:40] <quanticle> No. Looks like it's some kind of fractal terrain generator?
[11:41:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[11:42:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was very easy to use and extremely cool and had a very slick and functional UI
[11:42:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I remember using the free version to generate planets on my PowerMac G4
[11:43:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> You could plot a flythrough course of your planet and it would render a QuickTime movie of it, which was the. coolest. feature. EVER
[11:46:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> They called their generation approach "parametric hyperspace". You'd locate a planet in the space of the various parameters the generator supported, and it would generate it and let you render it in a plethora of ways

Greenland is an autonomous territory[12] within the Kingdom of Denmark. …)
[11:46:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was, honestly, one of the coolest pieces of software I have used, ever
[11:46:46] <saturn2> "QBasic was intended as a replacement for GW-BASIC. It was based on the earlier QuickBASIC 4.5 compiler but without QuickBASIC's compiler and linker elements. Version 1.0 was shipped together with MS-DOS 5.0 and higher, as well as Windows 95, Windows NT 3.x, and Windows NT 4.0."
[11:46:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then it, and the company that made it, fell off the face of the internet
[11:47:11] <saturn2> y'all are confabulating
[11:47:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... about what
[11:47:26] <saturn2> qbasic
[11:47:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh
[11:48:16] <mst> fuck
[11:48:17] <feep> are we talking about qbasic?
[11:48:20] <feep> I fucking love qbasic
[11:48:34] <mst> I was
[11:48:40] <mst> then I was going to bed
[11:48:44] <mst> but apparently I'm not
[11:48:47] <feep> yeah I remember that, it used to ship with the os and then it stopped
[11:48:47] <nshepperd2> huh, it wasn't included in windows 98?
[11:48:51] <feep> it wasn't, yeah
[11:49:04] <feep> missed it dearly :(
[11:49:09] <nshepperd2> that would be why i never used it
[11:49:13] <mst> I used it on like DOS 6.22 through to windows 3.11
[11:49:32] <mst> by the time I was running 9x I was dual booting netbsd so I didn't really notice
[11:49:48] <feep> I think my problem for the longest time, was I had no idea *how* to go about learning c++
[11:49:52] *** Joins: galambo_ (galambo@user/galambo)
[11:49:58] <feep> and I really wanted to learn c++ cause I'd read in a book that it was faster than basic
[11:50:16] <quanticle> saturn2: That's just it
[11:50:21] <quanticle> It was supposed to be on my computer
[11:50:24] <quanticle> But it wasn't there
[11:50:31] <quanticle> I'm blaming Packard Bell for this lol
[11:50:36] <feep> and so like ... my point is, why the fuck didn't microsoft ship a C compiler with windows.
[11:50:50] <quanticle> feep: Why... would they?
[11:51:01] <feep> I mean they shipped fucking basic with windows
[11:51:03] <mst> feep: this is why I learned on an archimedes
[11:51:17] <mst> feep: no C compiler, but BBC BASIC and that embedded the arm assembler for the OS
[11:51:44] <feep> mst: I mean, I wouldn't have known what to do with it if I'd had an assembler
[11:52:00] <quanticle> feep: A basic interpreter requires significantly less space than a C compiler. Also, you have to remember that, back then, a lot of microcomputers were still programmed in assembler
[11:52:07] <feep> I think at that time, I had not yet entirely internalized the idea that I could find advice on the internet
[11:52:10] <feep> quanticle: not actually true
[11:52:14] *** Quits: galambo (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[11:52:20] <mst> feep: the archimedes' user manual taught me BBC BASIC and mentioned you -could- access the assembler
[11:52:29] <feep> like, a fully powered C compiler, sure, but something like tinycc is, well, tiny, even in binary form
[11:52:39] <mst> I bought a separate book for the assembly stuff
[11:52:46] <quanticle> feep: I mean, kinda yeah? Like for hobbyists (as opposed to "real programmers") you had BASIC and assembly
[11:52:51] <mst> arm26 was single issue with no pipelining
[11:53:00] <mst> I could visualise the CPU in my head trivially
[11:53:04] <quanticle> Compilers were for "real programmers" who had companies who could buy them such things
[11:53:04] <mst> was very nice
[11:53:07] <feep> mst: "tech books can be bought" another thing that child me had to separately realize
[11:53:49] <mst> but seriously the archimedes user manual that came with the A310 was like 40% "how to use the OS" and 60% "BBC BASIC"
[11:54:00] <mst> it was really quite awesome
[11:54:11] <saturn2> yeah, i was very interested in the computer and had mostly unlimited access to it, but almost no access to documentation or anyone else who knew how to do things
[11:54:19] <quanticle> ^
[11:54:26] <quanticle> I learned about autoexec.bat by deleting it
[11:54:40] <feep> update, I checked and tcc is 227KB
[11:54:48] <mst> my parents also subscribed to an archimedes user magazine that included programs to type in
[11:55:00] <mst> I think I may've been quite lucky my parents were the right sort of nuts
[11:55:30] <quanticle> Yeah, my hand me down Packard Bell came with Microsoft Bob
[11:55:33] <quanticle> And no documentation
[11:55:38] <adiabatty> the first thing I ever programmed was…Excel macros
[11:56:18] <mst> I think we got the a310 in about '89 or '90
[11:56:30] <adiabatty> I got into C++ six months later, but…I have a hunch my origin story is the lamest possible other than "I learned to program in college"
[11:57:02] <mst> I remember age about 8 sitting on my parents' bed for an afternoon reading the entire BBC BASIC section of the user manual
[11:57:09] <mst> then going and starting to experiment

[11:59:04] <mst> rmmh: yeah, I only do it now over two or three evenings
[11:59:07] <quanticle> My programming education was entirely via hand-me-down books until I got to college. How did I learn C? Via one of my dad's hand-me-down books. How did I learn Java? Via one of my dad's friends' hand-me-down books. How did I learn Perl? Literally found "Perl For Dummies" in a pile of free books at the annual school library give-away
[11:59:51] <mst> rmmh: sit down in a beer garden for a couple hours a night
[12:00:07] <quanticle> The Java story is the most amusing. My dad's friend was like, "Hey your son is into programming, right? Here give him this. Trust me, Java is the next big thing"
[12:00:17] <mst> quanticle: lol
[12:00:54] <quanticle> It was literally a 1200 page doorstop that covered Java 1.2 and the entire Java standard library
[12:01:05] <mst> quanticle: then again I learned java at age 12 or so because the pure maths professor I was working with wanted to visualise a thing we'd been poking at
[12:01:34] <mst> then I noticed something weird ... and he got a paper out of it
[12:01:37] <Robomot> [Less Wrong [frontpage]] Failing safely is the anomaly by Andrew Vlahos - https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JwfkYzTehmGsizvuL/failing-safely-is-the-anomaly
[12:02:12] <mst> my name is on the paper but I didn't do any meaningful math towards proving anything, I just pointed out something weird in the visualisation we'd built and insisted it wasn't a bug until he checked it out
[12:03:35] <quanticle> feep: I think the bigger obstacle to shipping a C compiler with every OS is the licensing fee rather than the file size. Back then, the norm was that compilers were proprietary, and rather expensive. It was one thing for Unix vendors to include a C compiler with every machine, because those machines were workstations that cost as much as a car. The price of a compiler was relatively small
[12:03:36] <mst> uh .. I say this cos it's funny and I -didn't- do any of the math, this is not a humblebrag
[12:03:37] <quanticle> comparatively. Not so for a DOS or MacOS microcomputer that was supposed to be affordable for the middle classes.

[12:04:25] <mst> did learn both GWBASIC and UBASIC because they had more math functions
[12:04:28] <mst> that was fascinating
[12:05:21] <quanticle> mst: The real irony behind the Java story is that it was the *Perl* book that got me my first programming job
[12:05:42] <mst> quanticle: right, gcc was a fat-ass bastard but it wasn't just free, most vendors' compilers were pcc based and kinda shit optimisation wise
[12:05:57] <feep> update: qbasic 1.1 is 287KB
[12:06:06] <feep> tcc is smaller, lol.
[12:06:12] <mst> quanticle: I mean, yeah, in like 2000 or so perl was -way- more useful than java
[12:06:14] <feep> of course, you need a separate editor
[12:06:28] <quanticle> Because I'd written a bunch of cgi-perl scripts for various random hacks, and I was talking about them with one of my friends at the university. And he was friends with one of the people in the IT department. So when they had an opening for a student developer, my friend told me I should apply and that he'd put in a good word for me.
[12:07:14] <quanticle> Well, this is around 2003-2004, so Java is starting to catch on
[12:07:21] <feep> quanticle: I mean yeah, fair enough, but it's a question of "could microsoft write tcc"
[12:07:32] <mst> feep: so I'm not trying to recommend this but I love that p3rl.org/C::Blocks exists
[12:07:34] <Robomot> C::Blocks - embeding a fast C compiler directly into your Perl parser - metacpan.org (embeding a fast C compiler directly into your Perl parser)
[12:07:43] <feep> mst: haha
[12:07:55] <mst> feep: direct blocks in a perl module that get on-demand tcc'ed
[12:08:07] <feep> mst: if I wanted this, I'd probably just write it to a C file, yeah
[12:08:11] <feep> totally doable tho
[12:08:12] <mst> feep: you might never want to use it but it's very perl
[12:08:15] <quanticle> feep: They could have, but I'm not sure they had any interest in doing so. And not just Microsoft. *None* of the microcomputer vendors shipped a C compiler with their machines.
[12:08:25] <feep> quanticle: fair enough
[12:08:37] <feep> so I guess the idea with qbasic is they shipped qbasic cause they *couldn't* sell it?
[12:08:40] <quanticle> It's not like you had Altair and TRS machines with C compilers until Evil Em Dollar wiped them out
[12:08:41] <mst> quanticle: because in that era the thing that performance cared about was fortran
[12:09:06] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[12:09:07] <mst> as such, the micro vendors made much more of an effort for their fortran compilers
[12:09:52] <quanticle> Yeah, but I don't recall any of them shipping Fortran compilers with their machines either.
[12:10:00] <quanticle> But I might be wrong there, and you are free to correct me
[12:10:05] <mst> feep: also there's p3rl.org/Inline::C which builds things on the fly with your system compiler
[12:10:07] <Robomot> Inline::C - metacpan.org (C Language Support for Inline)
[12:10:27] <mst> feep: both very nice for people who needed a -bit- of C but weren't really C programmers
[12:10:34] <saturn2> it seems like most people were using pascal back then
[12:10:49] <mst> quanticle: I think I said the wrong thing, more minicomputers and unices had serious fortron
[12:11:07] <mst> C was this shitty half assed language built to be slightly less annoying than ASM for writing unix itself
[12:11:37] <mst> saturn2: pascal should have won! RETVRN!
[12:11:39] <saturn2> C was part of unix culture which had limited overlap with personal computing
[12:12:11] <quanticle> Yeah. I remember that Dilbert strip: "Here's a nickel, kid. Buy yourself a *real* computer"
[12:12:34] <mst> saturn2: right, 'real' archimedes apps were in asm with a BASIC wrapper
[12:12:48] <adiabatty> imagine your language limiting you to 255-byte strings
[12:12:56] <saturn2> much like BBSes and the internet, which existed at the same time but had very little overlap in users
[12:13:13] <nshepperd2> hm, gumbel_rao makes *less* biased gradients when conditional_gumbel ignores the gradient through the gumbels. weird
[12:13:14] <mst> \0 terminated strings were because they were efficient on the early PDPs
[12:13:45] <quanticle> Whenever I see \0, I think it's an emoticon of someone waving at me
[12:14:06] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)

[12:25:02] <mst> saturn2: the bullying was ok so long as I beat the shit out of somebody every two years or so
[12:25:34] <mst> just had to err on the side of not hospitalising them because otherwise I got detention
[12:26:37] <saturn2> hmm
[12:26:39] <quanticle> Hmmm... I'm trying to look up the chemistry of this iron-air battery and what I'm seeing doesn't seem battery related. It's about using steam with pure iron powder as an energy storage mechanism for hydrogen.
[12:28:31] <mst> saturn2: N=1 but that was about the cadence on which I needed to hurt somebody to remind everybody else that I'd been ignoring their idiocy because I didn't care, not because I was an easy target
[12:28:33] <saturn2> meanwhile i got detention for other kids hitting me
[12:29:14] <mst> I was the little nerd, they generally didn't want to admit I'd hit them in the first place

[12:39:24] <mst> saturn2: he spat on me, and I did no actual damage, and I literally waited to confess
[12:39:44] <quanticle> At Wayzata there were a number of kids that were disruptive but 1) it was always *borderline* and 2) their parents were rich and always went to bat for them against the school administration

[12:40:18] <mst> saturn2: zero tolerance is stupid
[12:40:22] <kuudes> there was basic on c64 which had 64 kb memory tops, and the interpreter used just some kb or something
[12:40:44] <mst> saturn2: it would presumably have meant he'd've got thrown out for his behaviour towards me, and that would also have been stupid
[12:40:44] <saturn2> wonder why school administrators love it
[12:40:46] <dbohdan> feep: Have you seen QB64?
[12:41:07] <quanticle> Zero tolerance is stupid, and it's also imperfectly enforced. Like I said, as long as you can keep it borderline and you have parents who are willing to work the bureaucracy for you, "zero" can be quite a large number actually
[12:41:44] <mst> my parents didn't need to do that (I believe they would've done, depending, but they didn't need to)
[12:41:47] <saturn2> putting someone in the hospital doesn't seem borderline
[12:42:18] <nshepperd2> (Is the gumbel-rao paper just wrong about 'Note that the total derivative d softmaxτ (θ + Gk )/dθ is taken through both θ and Gk'? It also says that 'For the case K = 1, our estimator reduces to the standard ST-GS estimator' but this is actually false if you let the gradient go through Gk)
[12:42:37] <mst> saturn2: taking him to the hospital was a waste of time and just because his parents were idiots
[12:43:14] <saturn2> that also wouldn't matter on the planet of my childhood
[12:43:16] <quanticle> saturn2: Also, you have to note that mst is in the UK. Was "zero tolerance" ever a thing in the UK?
[12:43:26] <mst> saturn2: he later told me he thought it was fucking stupid and apologised for spitting on me
[12:43:26] <saturn2> i know
[12:44:12] <saturn2> quanticle: it's mind-boggling because it's so foreign
[12:44:50] <mst> also he'd been picking fights with the entire rest of the school, if it hadn't been me who brought him to a halt it would probably have been one of the kickboxers and then, yeah, hospital -would- have been a good idea
[12:46:01] <mst> which honestly wouldn't've been helpful for anybody
[12:46:03] <quanticle> Yeah, zero tolerance is a peculiarly US-centric phenomenon
[12:46:44] <kuudes> usa is very peculiar
[12:47:48] <mst> and frankly he was the one with the problem, I just dealt with it proportionately
[12:48:12] <mst> main reason I got in trouble was he could run faster than I could
[12:48:21] <mst> so after spitting on me he exited stage left
[12:49:11] <mst> given the numbers of witnesses to that, if I could've grabbed him immediately it would've just been filed under "well, he provoked this, come on"
[12:49:36] <mst> since it took me 20 minutes to corner him and -then- hurt him it got written up as "partially provoked"
[12:49:53] <kuudes> yes, time to consider is a factor
[12:49:56] <PapuaHardyNet> now that's rage
[12:50:35] <mst> he *spat* on me
[12:50:47] <mst> 20 minutes was not nearly enough time to calm down
[12:50:58] <quanticle> Yeah, spitting on someone is pretty much worthy of an ass-kicking
[12:51:31] <PapuaHardyNet> I think you did well, I was too much of a wuss as a kid to fight
[12:52:05] <feep> dbohdan: nope
[12:52:17] <mst> so I cornered him, I picked him up off the floor by his throat until he was clearly scared he was going to die, then before my constricting his airway came close to -damaging- him I told him "never to that again" and dropped him and let him run
[12:53:37] <mst> if he'd carried on with that level of stupid at people, somebody would've broken at least one bone

[12:56:02] <mst> he and I actually ended up friends later
[12:56:12] <quanticle> Yeah, in my case it was more an instinctive fight-or-flight response
[12:57:08] <nshepperd2> I once told the principal that another student was sexually harrassing me. when the guy came and apologized to me the next day, there was fear in his eyes
[12:57:31] <mst> I'm not sure who I was at the time, just my reactions tend to involve judo throws and choke holds rather than fists
[12:57:39] <nshepperd2> i wondered what exactly they did

[12:59:36] <mst> slammed into me in a corridor, I put my arm straight out with a fist, they turned around just in time to get that in the face
[13:00:05] <mst> oh, wait, lol
[13:00:19] <mst> the turned around was because an idiot friend of theirs had pushed them at me
[13:01:37] <mst> and it was actually the same dude, and the subsequent conversation of "my idiot mate pushed me", "shit, sorry, not your fault then", "nah, that tooth cap was loose already and pissing me off, and anyway it was his fault, I'll deal with him when I get back from the dentist" was how the dude I strangled and I became friends
[13:02:03] <mst> (my life has been odd)
[13:02:48] <quanticle> Okay, hear me out. High performance desktops need like... a *lot* of power, right? Hundreds of (sometimes even a thousand) watts? Well, the problem is that USB-C maxes out at 100W. So we need more. We need something like quad dual USB-C to power our modern desktops

There was no proof for any

Consensus, anyway, had it that the cocktail was an American drink—at least that’s what Charles Dickens and a host of other smell-fungus British travelers visiting America in the 1830s and 1840s grudgingly conceded. As for the name, the great H.L. Mencken sat down in 1945 to thresh out the question, finding seven plausible theories. Plausible, but not probable: None had any direct evidence to support it.

Yes, China’s leaders embraced economic growth, but that growth has always been toward the telos of comprehensive national power. China’s young people may be increasingly ready to cash out and have some fun, but the leadership is just not there yet. They’ve got bigger fish to fry — they have to avenge the Century of Humiliation and claim China’s rightful place in the sun and blah blah.
[21:05:55] <two2thehead> And so when China’s leaders look at what kind of technologies they want the country’s engineers and entrepreneurs to be spending their effort on, they probably don’t want them spending that effort on stuff that’s just for fun and convenience. They probably took a look at their consumer internet sector and decided that the link between that sector and geopolitical power had simply become too tenuous to keep throwing capital and high-

[21:06:57] <two2thehead> "“Lying flat” is a potential threat, however ephemeral, to the social contract that has held China together for more than three decades. The phenomenon, which has gripped social media in recent weeks, describes the growing tendency of urban youths to opt out of the rat race and take unambitious, low-paying jobs or not work at all, eschewing conventional goals in favor of a minimalist, subsistence existence. It’s a social movement th

[21:10:10] <two2thehead> "Ever since the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989, the Communist Party has tied its legitimacy to economic development. In essence, the implicit bargain has been: Refrain from demanding political reform or challenging the government’s grip on power, and the party will deliver constantly rising incomes and living standards."

A commentator in the Nanfang Daily, a party newspaper, called the trend “not only unjust, but also shameful.” Lying flat was “poisonous chicken soup” with no value, said the article, which enjoined China’s young people to recommit to a traditional Communist virtue: “At any time, no matter what stage of development, struggle is always the brigh

[23:22:23] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Since satiety is largely due to stretch of the stomach and people tend to eat a consistent weight of food, increasing food volume and mass increases satiety. This can be achieved without increasing the calories of food by mixing food with a material that cannot be metabolized. Such a material should be inert, safe, resistant to stomach acid, lack taste, available in powder
[23:22:23] <feepbot> form, smooth, resistant to heat, and cost effective. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is an ideal substance for this purpose. It is a soft plastic that is widely considered to be the most inert material known and is extremely stable. Animal feeding trials showed that rats fed a diet of 25% PTFE for 90 days had no signs of toxicity and that the rats lost weight. This article publishes
[23:22:24] <feepbot> the data from these subchronic animal feeding trials, reviews the relevant available literature, and hypothesizes that increasing the volume of food by mixing the food with PTFE powder at a ratio of 3 parts food to 1 part PTFE by volume will substantially improve satiety and reduce caloric consumption in people.' https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1932296815626726

[23:30:24] <catern> should I actually listen to Jonathan Blow talks? I hate talks, has he written anything instead of just endlessly talking? a subset of people seem to really like him
[23:33:09] <dbohdan> catern: I liked his talks about game design.  I've outlined two here: https://dbohdan.com/wiki/jonathan-blow
[23:33:10] <Robomot> dbohdan: jonathan-blow
[23:33:48] <Ralith> that seems like a terrible person to listen to

[23:35:23] <dbohdan> Ralith: Why?
[23:36:01] <Ralith> all violently-held opinions, no rigor
[23:37:06] <Ralith> super masturbatory attitude
[23:37:31] <dbohdan> "No rigor" is true

[23:39:24] <catern> Ralith: yeah that's kind of the vibe I've gotten from not having consumed any of it - but then, sometimes people have violently-held opinions which are correct
[23:39:28] <catern> my opinions for example
[23:39:38] <Ralith> :D
[23:40:07] <Ralith> I definitely wouldn't knock e.g. going to Obormot\Arcturus for baking advice
[23:40:55] <Ralith> well, that's not fair, Obormot's baking advice is in at least some cases highly rigorous
[23:41:28] <Ralith> that pie turned around my opinion on the entire class of custard pies

[23:44:01] <catern> although I'm not super motivated to do any game design, if I ever designed a game it would be something heavily based on, like, interacting with Linux via system calls
[23:45:05] <catern> and the UI would be writing C or something
[23:45:27] <Ralith> maybe add a multiplayer layer through a webapp that lets you exchange patches and code review!
[23:45:36] <catern> yes exactly
[23:45:47] <Ralith> wait a minute this is just participating in open source
[23:46:44] <catern> conveniently I just wrote a first draft of http://catern.com/reuse.html (which is my absolute core principle in programming) which kind of explains why I would do such a thing :)
[23:46:45] <Robomot> If you want to solve a problem simply, reuse existing abstractions
[23:47:21] <catern> problem: create a video game UI suitable for interacting with environments full of complex objects, solution: use an operating system
[23:48:00] <nshepperd> open source gift culture, but with points which you can use to buy virtual hats
[23:48:17] <Ralith> > You don't need to, and probably shouldn't, build a new reusable abstraction if you're just solving one problem
