[01:14:49] <lpv> ahm, not sure
[01:14:59] <ayekat> or just overall, how do you start xss-lock?
[01:15:00] <lpv> that was systemctl status myservice
[01:15:36] <thurstylark> does it have DISPLAY set correctly?
[01:15:39] <lpv> It was through default i3 config before. But I used it as last line of my service Exec script after that
[01:15:54] <lpv> display?
[01:15:59] <ayekat> what is `myservice` exactly? if the service was started before DISPLAY was exported into the service environment, likely the service doesn't have DISPLAY set
[01:16:09] <thurstylark> systemd --user services don't adopt the xorg env like it would when run through the i3 config
[01:16:36] <thurstylark> the DISPLAY env var is how xorg apps talk to xorg
[01:16:51] <ayekat> lpv: how are you starting X and i3?

[01:18:17] <ayekat> that's quite a hack TBH - forcing DISPLAY like that assumes that X will always run on :0

[01:18:32] <lpv> oh

[01:21:46] <ayekat> lpv: I doubt that
[01:22:20] <ayekat> honestly, I would start xss-lock from i3 itself, directly

[01:23:26] <ayekat> if yes, you could create a user service and have i3 start that (with `systemctl --user start ...`) - but that seems slightly overkill to me tbh

[01:24:48] <lpv> you mean i3 start xss-lock?
[01:24:50] <ayekat> the important part is that your custom xss-lock service is *not* enabled, otherwise it will start the moment you log in, at which point DISPLAY might not be set yet (not quite sure what exactly the sequence of variables being set is if logging in via lightdm...)

[01:51:39] <thurstylark> the fun part is the way the PKGBUILD works because it's a vcs package so as soon as you commit more contents to the repo, you can immediately rebuild the package to be installed

[01:54:47] <thurstylark> gets around the background permission thing you were talking about

[04:10:56] <jtritz> (i've caught flack before for this cron job as it has showed up in the system logs)
[04:11:55] <jtritz> anyway, my questions are 2fold, 1) has cron changed somehow, or have i just forgotten how i set this up?  I can't seem to figure out where this script is being called from anymore??? presumably i edited another file and pointed cron at it with some settings

[04:13:06] <jensen> anyone experiencing choppy experience this past month or so?

[04:13:55] <thurstylark> jtritz: do you know if your script is getting run? like, do your echos make it into the journal or wherever it usually ends up?
[04:15:01] <jtritz> sudo crontab -u root -l does show the job
[04:15:23] <jtritz> thurstylark: not sure where to look for those echos
[04:16:13] <jtritz> i guess my note at the top reminds me how i entered the job
[04:16:23] <Namarrgon> you have a user script in root's crontab?

[04:22:20] <Namarrgon> jtritz: then maybe you should fix it
[04:22:35] <tirnanog> just because it starts in the foreground doesn't mean this long-standing behaviour of crond is changed.

[04:28:38] <Namarrgon> jtritz: anything you execute as your user can own your system via that file
[04:28:44] <tirnanog> it's writeable by jritz in his capacity as the author of the script. if it were world-writable, sure.
[04:29:18] <tirnanog> really, it probably don't need to be run as root at all (in which case, moving the script to /root is going to be counter-productive when that is addressed).
[04:30:22] <tirnanog> jrt: if you move it to the root user directory, you'll never be able to execute it as an ordinary use from cron until you move it out of the root user directory anyway. and, for that reason, I disagree that this in any way constitutes a 'fix' for anything.
[04:30:46] <tirnanog> if you want to know what's going wrong in the script, trace it. if you want it to be safer, schedule it in your own crontab, not root's. two different things.
[04:31:46] <jtritz> tirnanog: i see, makes sense.. i think it's possible i had the sound muted, and am being called away, so i'll trouble shoot more later, and look at running the script under my own user

[07:26:10] <mpan> Soni: no ideas yet, but how fast is the screen flickering?
[07:26:29] <Soni> VGA works
[07:26:31] <mpan> Is it like half hertz or less, or is that just random quick garbage flickering?
[07:27:10] <Soni> mpan: it flickers between two instances of garbage and only when using X and HDMI together
[07:27:37] <mpan> Oh, “garbage” is the keyword here. I was wondering if that is not the display rejecting signal.
[07:27:46] <mpan> (or no output for that particular resolution)
[07:27:48] <rcf> A video of the corruption would be useful, or even just a few pictures. Does the display work with some other device (using the same cable ideally) 
[07:28:16] <rcf> Given current market conditions I'd much rather replace a monitor than a GPU

[07:28:52] <Soni> weird how specific the issue is
[07:29:55] <rcf> With hardware on the margins of failure this isn't too weird (the last time I had a video cable go bad it was surprisingly similar to this) 
[07:30:37] <Soni> we do remember there being a reason we don't use HDMI
[07:31:20] <Soni> but not sure if this is it
[07:31:38] <thurstylark> this sounds like a pretty good reason lol
[07:31:46] <rcf> Well, if the VGA works to your satisfaction I say go with it, then try to rule out monitor or cable issues. Also try not-Linux operating systems in case this is a bizarre driver bug. 
[07:33:59] <Soni> if only this TV had VGA...
[07:34:15] <rcf> Is there DP out? 
[07:34:24] <rcf> That usually converts to HDMI fairly easily.

[14:21:41] <Gagis> they can all share the same efi partition but you should install a bootloader only from one of them
[14:22:11] <Gagis> with arch its trivial to just not install one but might take some minor work with some others. not impossible with any

[14:23:06] <ouestbillie> Gagis: thanks, might just do seperate efi
[14:23:17] <Gagis> depending on bootloader you can put kernel images from each onto the efi partition or just keep them in the root partitions of each distro

[15:06:36] <mpan> pacman never erases anything while installing. It overwrites, but only files that should not be modified anyway. Those, which may be modified (e.g. configs) are backed up. So just run chrooted pacman and reinstall the damaged packages.
[15:06:52] <mpan> `pacman -Qkk` will help to identify, what is broken, if you already installed a lot of them.

[15:18:11] <MrElendig> indeed
[15:19:19] <MrElendig> problem with just pacstrapping over is that you won't remember everything you had installed, so you will end up with lose untracked files but you will think that everything is fine if those are still working, except that you will never get updates etc for them
[15:19:24] <earnestly> All you can do is: for all files on the system, check with pacman -F/pkgfile to determine which package has ownership, then use that package list to install them.  The major issue with this approach is fixing asdeps / asexplicit install reasons
[15:19:44] <MrElendig> yea and ^ if you do that

[23:10:51] <Tom^> Furai: some reddit posts with the 5900/5950 seems to fiddle with SOC voltage increasing it 0.05 etc, also seems to occur in windows.

[23:21:42] <Namarrgon> are you using gnome with wayland or x11?
[23:21:48] <Namarrgon> have you tried any other wm/de?
[23:23:43] <MrElendig> !give Furai aw rasdaemon
[23:23:44] <phrik> Furai: No results found.
[23:23:46] <MrElendig> hmm
[23:23:51] <Furai> For now just gnome with x11 as I'm the most familiar with that one. I have nvidia card with latest proprietary drivers installed through pacman. Card is 3070 TI from MSI. Mobo: 570x from MSI as well.
[23:24:47] <Furai> I'll first try finding the bios update if any, then disable any power optimisations. Hopefully it will help.
[23:24:53] <MrElendig> Furai: install rasdaemon amd enable/start the two daemons and see if ras-mc-ctl --summary shows anything interesting after it hangs
[23:24:56] <Furai> I've verified amd-ucode is getting loaded.
[23:25:35] <Furai> Uh, any wiki page on that? Have never heard of something like that in the past.

[23:30:36] <Furai> Yeah, I meant enabled.
[23:30:36] <MrElendig> and now you just have to wait until it dies again
[23:30:54] <Furai> I think it might have been in idle state when this happened.
[23:31:02] <Furai> Anyway, thx.
[23:31:08] <Furai> I'll try other stuff till then.
