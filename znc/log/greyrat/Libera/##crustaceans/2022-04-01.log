[16:28:07] <gerikson> how to write cron to run every 30m between 7:30 and 10:30?
[16:29:24] <edk> with two rules i think

[18:08:55] <gwozniak> This feels awfully suspect
[18:13:19] <epilys> gerikson, know what, you can do this with a single systemd timer instead of cron if the host uses it
[18:13:29] <gwozniak> Wife had an interesting day yesterday.  She discovered evidence that a student was going to cause some self-harm so she had to escort the student to the hospital and act as a guardian for a while

[18:18:28] <epilys> Kudos for helping
[18:25:16] <gwozniak> My wife is always suffering from imposter syndrome and is convinced she's not a good teacher.  I tell her all that she cares so much for the students that there's no way she's bad at it
[18:27:21] <epilys> she'd fit right in programming
[18:27:31] <epilys> it's interesting how common impostor syndrome is in general
[18:28:05] <gwozniak> It's not a tech-only thing at all
[18:28:15] <gwozniak> It's just we make a bigger deal out of it ;)
[18:29:19] <river> i think its more prevelant in programming because most programmers /are/ imposters
[18:29:32] <epilys> river, whoa there :D
[18:29:40] <epilys> that's a strong claim
[18:30:34] <companion_cube> some are imputers, imgeters, and sometimes inheaders or indelers

[18:32:08] <epilys> doesn't leetcode have code execution?
[18:33:19] <river> thats cheating

[18:48:54] <epilys> do they re-adjust compensation for remote dev's location?
[18:50:00] <kronk> honestly? not sure, I don't think so. they'll pay for your relocation.
