[17:04:23] <Gamara> Hey so I have 2 variables playerId, and client connection (client) object. I need to be able to lookup playerId from client and lookup client from playerId. What data structure should I use for this
[17:04:56] <Gamara> Is there a HashMap that has keys that map to eachother
[17:05:41] <Gamara> I guess that doesnt make sense
[17:05:50] <Gamara> I was thinking of just using two hashmaps
[17:06:02] <Gamara> do you think that is my best way to go?
[17:06:09] <Gamara> or arrays() rather

[21:23:42] <Rockwood> make sure your path is correct
[21:24:51] <Gamara> my path looks fine https://i.imgur.com/9HOJB28.png
[21:25:40] <Byteflux> Gamara: `use db\dbConnect;` at the top of your file, or make the file share the same namespace (`namespace db;`) or use the fully qualified function name when calling it: `\db\dbConnect()`
[21:26:16] <Byteflux> but also consider using Composer instead with a PSR-4 autoloader configured which is what most people do
[21:27:04] <Byteflux> oh your function is called connectToDatabase(), not dbConnect()
[21:27:07] <Byteflux> but you get the idea.
[21:27:54] <Gamara> thank you so much
[21:28:20] <Gamara> I could get it to work by using require once then just doing \db\connectToDatabase()

[22:40:17] <Gamara> https://pastebin.com/zCiig9D7
[22:41:36] <Sammitch> because the server is actively refusing your connection.
[22:41:56] <Sammitch> so it's likely the wrong port, or the port is not open on the firewall
[22:43:31] <Byteflux> I don't see MYSQL_HOST in the env file so it may just be empty and defaulting to localhost
[22:43:35] <Sammitch> looking at your paste/compose your hostname should be literally "db", but you seem to be implying that you're using 127.0.0.1
[22:43:42] <Byteflux> Based on the docker-compose.yml, the host should be 'db'

[22:46:04] <Gamara> so my port is incorrect?

[22:46:57] <Byteflux> At least not in the PHP container
[22:47:12] <Sammitch> 127.0.0.1 is whatever container you happen to be in at the time
[22:47:12] <Byteflux> The mysql image should be using the default port
[22:47:23] <Gamara> so no need to map
[22:47:38] <Gamara> ?
[22:48:01] <Gamara> thank you again :)
[22:48:08] <Byteflux> You don't even need the 3306:3306 part in your compose config if everything that accesses the db container is within the same docker network
[22:48:14] <Sammitch> the port config in your compose maps container ports out to the host network, but that's not the network that the containers are acutally connected to
[22:48:32] <Gamara> oh yeah because containers are all connected right?
[22:48:49] <Byteflux> within the same network they are NAT'd
[22:49:24] <Sammitch> to _you_ they're running on localhost [and also on every other IP address you have, watch out for that] but as far as the containers are concerned each container is its own host on docker's virtual network
[22:49:25] <Byteflux> they can talk to each other like a private network
[22:50:10] <Sammitch> they're not _all_ connected, they happen to be connected to the same virtual network, of which there could be multiple distinct networks
[22:50:14] <Byteflux> Whenever you start a service with Docker Compose, it will create (by default) a network shared between those services.
[22:50:44] <Sammitch> docker-compose creates a network per-config, so if you have 2 compose projects they won't be able to talk to each other by default
[22:50:52] <Sammitch> Byteflux: jinx
[22:51:15] <Byteflux> It's a convenience that Docker Compose provides, but you can achieve the same thing by manually creating a network with `docker network create` and then passing the `--net` option to `docker run`
[22:51:16] <Byteflux> :P

[22:52:06] <Gamara> I tried changing host to db and it still doesn't work

[23:07:14] <Gamara> That is what I did da_wunder `$dbHost=getenv('MYSQL_HOST');`  and in my .env file I have `MYSQL_HOST=db`, and in PHP: `$conn = new \PDO('mysql:host=' . $dbHost . ';dbname=' . $dbName, $dbUser, $dbPass);`

[23:44:52] <MrBurns> I tried to find an easy way to echo something after submit and after 2 seconds go back to form page. I did not find any neat ways. Any ideas?
[23:48:25] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:48:41] <da_wunder> MrBurns: I recommend you to use some logger for things like that

[23:49:17] <da_wunder> MrBurns: eg monolog is battle tested for things like that - https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog
[23:58:24] <da_wunder> MrBurns: and if your "echo something" means that you want to show something to user who submitted that form - then use javascript, php is request <--> response you cannot modify that sent response...
