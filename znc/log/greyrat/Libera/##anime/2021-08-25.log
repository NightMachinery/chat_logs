[06:55:55] <MootPoot> They would have had better things to keep me on with
[06:56:13] <MootPoot> supposedly the biggest two things they mentioned was that I was a bad culture fit, and inter department communication

[06:57:16] <emmeka> they gotta give you 2 weeks, so long as you've worked there over 3 months, I think (or at least, it's this way in several provinces)
[06:57:32] <MootPoot> my boss was on leave so I asked my direct boss, he told me to talk to an exec for something, I did, then that turned out to be some kind of weird thing where that exec talked to my boss and my boss in the termination meeting said I make her look bad
[06:57:55] <MootPoot> the culture fit one was I think they were expecting a full on app developer for the price of a intern 
[06:58:00] <MootPoot> They gave me 1 week
[06:58:14] <emmeka> then they owe you a week's pay.
[06:58:31] <MootPoot> officialially I'm gone on the 31st but the termination was today
[06:58:42] <MootPoot> so they're still going to give me the money for this entire month
[06:58:47] <emmeka> they can give you either notice or pay in lieu of it, in whatever combination they want, but they gotta give you one or the other.
[07:00:10] <MootPoot> but anyway, it was a lot of small things
[07:00:25] <MootPoot> I'm not hurting for cash or anything but at the same time I am a little worried
[07:00:34] <MootPoot> I do need to get a paid spot to finish my degree
[07:00:55] <MootPoot> companies that hire me do get like 75% off due to a govt of canada wage subsidy

[11:04:34] <theholyduck> i mean hes more of a tech generalist maybe. but theyve done like live streams and behind the scenes videos of stuff
[11:04:38] <theholyduck> he clearly knows his shit
[11:05:01] <DunceCotus> the creator of linux?
[11:05:06] <theholyduck> no the tech tips guy
[11:05:06] <theholyduck> :P
[11:05:13] <DunceCotus> oh
[11:06:03] <theholyduck> id love some specifics. otherwise im forced to think amigojapan belived the lie-nus thing :
[11:06:04] <amigojapan> theholyduck: he was asked to interview a NASA computer expert about a computers from the space era and he kept asking dumb questions like "is this cable fiber optic. Or is it liquid cooled
[11:07:36] <amigojapan> theholyduck: for a computer from the 60s
[11:08:21] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  apollo era computing is like virtually nothign like what computer tech is today
[11:08:32] <theholyduck> linus is like 40 or something
[11:09:00] <amigojapan> theholyduck: also I am not the only one that think he is dumb. There are videos roasting him for being dumb

[11:12:30] <MootPoot> theholyduck: if you care to watch his newest video is really cool
[11:12:30] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  i suggest try watching some of the more unscripted stuff they do :P linus knows what hes talking about. but a) they make videos for normal people so things have to be dumbed down a bit
[11:12:35] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  yeah i saw it
[11:12:40] <MootPoot> Open source atomic clocks in computers 
[11:12:48] <MootPoot> I never even knew that was possible
[11:12:52] <theholyduck> and b) unlike some channels they do a TON of content 
[11:12:54] <MootPoot> Genuinely new info 
[11:12:57] <theholyduck> and for a mass market
[11:13:02] <theholyduck> so they cant spend 40 minutes talking about a lightbulb

[11:13:03] <MootPoot> Ass market
[11:13:07] <MootPoot> Lmao
[11:13:07] <amigojapan> theholyduck: I don't understand why you are trying to defend him
[11:13:35] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  like i just think claiming hes dumb or doesnt know computers is absrurd
[11:13:45] <MootPoot> You don't like 45 minute lightbulb videos theholyduck  ?
[11:13:58] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i do. but clearly you cant run a company that employs like 30 people
[11:14:02] <theholyduck> on 45 minute lightbulb videos
[11:14:07] <MootPoot> Lol
[11:14:34] <MootPoot> Sorry it's just the phrase 40 minute lightbulb video which is funny to me for some reason
[11:14:50] <theholyduck> ltt makes a specific type of content that necesitates being more fast and looose and simple
[11:15:23] <theholyduck> but like linus does like a 90 minute tech live stream every week where you can like hear him talk about stuff at lenght, in depth, in his own words
[11:15:33] <theholyduck> he clearly knows his shit 
[11:15:56] <MootPoot> Also due to being big enough due to mass market appeal he can do videos that nobody else can

[11:16:32] <theholyduck> i especially like really like his takes on how the tech media industry works. 
[11:16:33] <MootPoot> They won't let some random 5k sub YouTuber into a laboratory that makes quantum computers
[11:16:46] <theholyduck> where he talks at lenght about like how companies do sponsorships. or run media events
[11:16:58] <theholyduck> so much fun behind the scenes bits
[11:17:19] <theholyduck> i dont watch like even half the videos they put out normally

[12:17:35] <emmeka> theholyduck
[12:17:43] <emmeka> this is potentially the worst take you've ever had
[12:18:01] <theholyduck> emmeka: hey. i stand by it
[12:18:03] <emmeka> please recuse yourself
[12:18:12] <theholyduck> every kyo-ani show since like fumoffu
[12:18:19] <theholyduck> has just had no flair
[12:18:33] <theholyduck> the animation is usually flawless and intresting
[12:18:47] <theholyduck> and everything else about the show feels like it was created by the bland wallpaper paste comitee
[12:18:53] <emmeka> KyoAni has such a distinct flair that they literally invented an entire style of animation which dominates everything
[12:19:07] <theholyduck> emmeka: i mean if you mean drawing moeblobs with no featrues 
[12:19:09] <theholyduck> is flair
[12:19:12] <theholyduck> and kyo-ani didnt start that
[12:19:19] <emmeka> yes, they did.
[12:19:36] <theholyduck> i always contented the start of moeblob anime was kannagi
[12:19:43] *** Joins: youloveme (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch)
[12:19:44] <theholyduck> which was a1
[12:19:57] <theholyduck> fall 2008 
[12:20:29] <theholyduck> predates k-on by half a year. 
[12:20:43] <theholyduck> and clannad is less moe blob and more egg and bacon faces
[12:20:48] <emmeka> not even, but anyway, it's very clear that the entire moeblob artstyle is derivative of K-on and it's success.
[12:21:02] <theholyduck> emmeka:  i mean they certainly popularized the style
[12:21:04] <theholyduck> with k-on
[12:21:07] <theholyduck> but kannagi beat them to it 
[12:21:09] <emmeka> and also, even within moeblob land, KyoAni series are so distinctive that they're easily recognizeable visually
[12:21:15] <theholyduck> emmeka: oh i dont disagree
[12:21:16] <amigojapan> Oh DunceCotus left :(
[12:21:24] <theholyduck> you can alwasy spot the kyo-ani anime
[12:21:26] <theholyduck> its the one with no soul 
[12:22:08] <amigojapan> emmeka: it's not worth it to debate it with theholyduck 
[12:22:11] <theholyduck> emmeka:  im not saying kyo-ani isnt distinctive. its just  they are distinctive by being boring
[12:22:17] <emmeka> I can't tell if I'm just being trolled right now because theholyduck is bored and knows I'll fight with him to relieve his boredom, or if there's anyone alive who thinks KyoAno anime "have no soul"
[12:22:39] <emmeka> anyway.
[12:22:57] <emmeka> JesseDesu I like the way Eru moves. She's sort of... twitchy, in a way that suits her personality
[12:22:58] <amigojapan> emmeka: he said that before to me
[12:23:29] <emmeka> which is also a great example that disproves theholyduck's point, Eru from Hyouka is animated with a lot of soul and in a very unique way
[12:23:47] <JesseDesu> i'm looking at some rule 34
[12:23:53] <JesseDesu> no good ones
[12:23:58] <theholyduck> emmeka: i think part of what im complaining about. is they have like 4-5 directors. and yet its utterly impossible to tell any of them appart
[12:24:03] <theholyduck> it just looks like "generic kyo-ani"
[12:24:10] <emmeka> surely, that is a good thing.
[12:24:19] <emmeka> it means they run a tight ship.

[12:25:54] <emmeka> I have argued about a lot of stupid things with theholyduck, but "KyoAni sucks" has to be the worst

[12:26:13] <theholyduck> they do what they do extremely well

[12:26:35] <rando25892> are they cool they sound like a big brand
[12:26:44] <beaky> yes kyoani made k-on

[12:28:29] <theholyduck> and its animated beautifully
[12:28:38] <emmeka> yes, not even supernatural show with weird girls is monogatari
[12:28:38] <JesseDesu> beaky, theres an idol episode in kyoukai no kanata

[16:49:51] <DunceCotus> this has gotten interesting but I gtg D:
[16:50:20] <omero> it is about how to remember and memories are not a dream.
[16:50:36] <DunceCotus> and dreams are not memories
[16:50:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you know when you know something is a "hallucination"it is not considered a real hallucination anymore I'm the medical field
[16:51:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it has a different name
[16:51:09] <omero> a collection of experiences that happened. it is not what you get with a trip due to allotropic substance, delusion or any such conditions.
[16:51:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well then how is reality not a hallucination?
[16:51:34] <DunceCotus> we don't know if reality is a hallucination or not
[16:51:55] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it is, but it is shared with other people
[16:52:02] <omero> please refrain to reference the simulation theories ;)
[16:52:43] <omero> because memories are real experiences and you can recall _only_ those that really happened
[16:53:10] <amigojapan> omero: there are false memories
[16:53:13] <omero> when you wake up after a dream, it is very rare you recall the whole dream sequence

[16:54:56] <DunceCotus> so they weren't false
[16:55:13] <DunceCotus> they were still true memories
[16:55:15] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's known in the psychiatric field
[16:55:22] <DunceCotus> even if they weren't of the shared delirium we call reality
[16:55:46] <omero> there is a condition. its called sinestesia

[17:11:46] <amigojapan> No
[17:11:53] <omero> does it comes as a form of language? including images, smells, and the full sensorial experience?
[17:12:18] <omero> it comes straight.

[17:13:01] <amigojapan> Yes

[17:18:17] <amigojapan> omero: not sure
[17:18:24] <omero> lets put it in other words then
[17:18:52] <omero> when you recall a memory, it will _always_ include the full sensorial experience
[17:19:13] <omero> sound, taste, smell, touch, vision
[17:19:28] <omero> not necessarily in that order.
[17:19:35] <amigojapan> omero: we often forget things too

[17:20:22] <omero> eh.

[17:21:14] <omero> what is possible to remember/recall about an experience

[22:33:35] <snake> what option?
[22:33:48] <Bco1981> snake: only thing i can think of is, in the stream-manager, the settings for chat, and show moderator actions
[22:34:07] <Bco1981> no option... it's inside beat saber. that option.
[22:34:19] <snake> are you tired from playing beatsaber?

[22:35:29] <snake> i think its due to my addons, but even with them seemingly totally nerfed for the twitch website, i still can't be seen in chat
[22:35:45] <Bco1981> hmm
[22:35:54] <snake> Bco1981, it is not literally +q but it is sort of like +q, where a user can send messages but nobody gets them

[22:46:58] <Bco1981> wow
[22:47:23] <Bco1981> did she do something during a stream? or a wrong twitt ?
[22:47:37] <Nanobot> I think it's just YouTube doing YouTube things.
[22:47:43] <Bco1981> ah
[22:48:14] <Nanobot> All HoloCouncil members lost nearly all of their subscribers a couple of days after their accounts were created.

[23:39:36] <DaPinkOne> most of hololive/vtubers are adults, and I find it increasingly unlikely that these "accidents" are real accidents.
[23:39:58] <DaPinkOne> they know what they're selling. They're playing a character and putting on a show.
[23:40:39] <Bco1981> sure, but it's not on the level of it is scripted. they are just humans, anyone could have made that coment
