[01:37:05] <Samian> The smoking habit is less hard-wired I'd say. That's self imposed.  But being a nightowl. That may be a very low-level subsystem tendency interwired into the entire brain for all I know

[02:15:45] <Samian> evolv  I question idea that light disrupts circadian rhythms for everyone. Supposedly light tells your body to wake up.  But for me, light makes me tired and drains my energy. Darkness is peaceful, quiet, and makes it easy to work. There are fewer distractions at night. Fewer visual noise
[02:16:23] <Samian> evolv  so the energy boost I get at night and drowsiness I get when out in the sun seems at odds with each other
[02:16:42] <Samian> literally I spend the entire day trying to wake up and I'm finally awake at 10pm
[02:17:04] <Samian> I feel more adhd during the day
[02:17:32] <evolv> how do you work in complete darkness, Samian?

[02:17:38] *** Joins: Leonarbro_ (~Leonet@user/leonarbro)
[02:19:03] <evolv> I'm a night owl, too. Light kind of stresses me out, I think because I associated it with school growing up and things to do that stressed me out. Things slow down when it's dark, it's less stimulating, so I am relaxed and think more clearly
[02:19:22] <evolv> thus, I don't want to go to bed early because I am enjoying the dark too much
[02:19:31] <evolv> which makes the next morning shitty
[02:20:15] <evolv> but I had trained myself in the past to fall asleep by 11 PM. I just end up breaking the rhythm by staying up later again for whatever reason I use to justify it
[02:20:34] <tinwhiskers> your circadian rhythm is not going to wake you up at 7:00am if you only went to bed at 5am. it's not that circadian rhythm doesn't work in you - it's that you're preventing it working

[14:22:34] <pussipupu> I'm not an expat I'm an immigrant :p
[14:22:45] <arryana> fair point
[14:24:08] <arryana> i can't usually get my head around being an immigrant
[14:26:13] <mnemon> are you planning on staying?
[14:26:43] <arryana> do you have an objection?
[14:27:04] <mnemon> no, just one of the determining factors of expat vs. migrant imo
[14:27:39] <mnemon> whether you're american living in england or aspiring englishperson ;)
[14:28:43] <arryana> hard to know where to draw that line, indefinite leave to remain is not the same as citizenship
[14:29:01] <arryana> i don't know if i'll ever be a citizen
[14:29:34] <mnemon> would tick the expat box in that case personally
[14:29:44] * arryana shrugs
[14:30:02] <arryana> uk is my home, there are other reasons citizenship is difficult
[14:31:48] <mnemon> does UK accept dual citizenship with US ?
[14:34:10] <arryana> i have no iea
[14:34:11] <arryana> idea
[14:35:55] <arryana> as long as my mother is alive, i have legal obligations to take care of for her, which demands i'm out of the uk more than is allowed for the period leading up to citizenship
[14:36:34] <arryana> when she dies that may change, but it's hard to say for now.
[14:36:41] <mnemon> ah :(
[14:37:00] <arryana> yeah, it isn't ideal
[14:38:00] <mnemon> I suppose there aren't that many issues with it anyways except the potential hassles with taxation? having indefinite permit with US passport vs. having UK citizenship that is?
[14:38:25] <arryana> i haven't got the foggiest notion.
[14:38:40] <arryana> my other half and employers deal with the tax crap, it's way over my head
[14:39:24] <pussipupu> I'm staying so I'm an immigrant, I wasn't seconded here by an employer so I'm not an expat
[14:39:36] <arryana> gotcha
[14:40:22] <mnemon> pussipupu: I moved to work in .ch for couple of years which was also being expat imo even without being seconded

[14:50:16] <pussipupu> hmm, I'd say that's a borderline case but fair enough
[14:50:56] <pussipupu> It's definitely possible to be a dual UK US citizen
[14:51:14] <arryana> it's all good, i lived in england the first five or six years i've been here
[14:51:41] <arryana> it hasn't been quite a year in scotland
[14:51:48] <mnemon> https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaksoiskansalaisuus#/media/Tiedosto:Dual_Citizenship.svg looks like most of europe allows it at least in principle
[14:51:48] <ro-bot-o> [url] Kaksoiskansalaisuus – Wikipedia | fi.wikipedia.org
[14:52:00] <pussipupu> Alexander Boris Murder Clown de Pfeffel Johnson was a dual citizen for instance
[14:52:08] <arryana> haha
[14:52:09] <mnemon> (green means they allow dual citizenship)
[14:54:15] <mnemon> I had some colleagues in .ch who still ditched the US one because of taxation among other things
[14:54:46] <arryana> i could see the issue there
[14:55:01] <pussipupu> If I could trade today I would in a heartbeat
[14:55:20] <pussipupu> But I'm glad I probably won't have to give up British citizenship when the time comes
[14:55:23] <arryana> two of my employers have eu/uk businesses anyway, or at least branches which are, which somehow counts

[14:57:27] <mnemon> I think the issue was that US demands taxes(and tax returns) no matter how long you live abroad and regardless of the country so it was a huge hassle despite doubletaxation agreements in addition to being rather expensive with the low taxes in .ch
[14:57:38] <milkyogurt> US is the only country in the developed world to tax you based on your citizenship, regardless of income source or residency -- globally. Eritrea is the other country to do this. so many US expats renounce eventually
[14:57:53] <mnemon> yeah
[14:58:02] <milkyogurt> US would tax you if you moved to Mars. US taxes you if you've never been to America (but were born to American parents)
[14:58:07] <milkyogurt> it's absurd, and intensely frustrating
[14:58:43] <TechTest> tax of existence
[14:59:12] <milkyogurt> US taxes your retirement, capital gains, anything/everything abroad, so the double taxation relief doesn't go that far (plus it has an income cap). Americans who stay abroad more than 5 years end up trying to ditch the monster
[14:59:26] <milkyogurt> ... which they tax you on too.
[14:59:33] <milkyogurt> and charge $2500 for
[14:59:41] <mnemon> the infamous exit tax
[14:59:44] <milkyogurt> yeah
[15:00:25] <milkyogurt> it's great revenue for the tax prep services, so it'll never change
[15:00:44] <milkyogurt> domestic americans don't care, or hate you, if you move abroad. so you have no allies

[15:20:59] <mnemon> you can get it in 4 if you "have strong ties" which seems to be determined by good enough grasp of the language according to migri. Or if you're married to a finnish citizen

[15:22:09] <pussipupu> I've passed the YKI language test for immigrants though which is the important one I think
[15:22:19] <mnemon> so as long as you've lived 4 years without interruption(meaning residence+registered, not actually being in the country) you can apply via either reason.

[15:29:36] <mnemon> although if they find out you've actually been travelling abroad for most of it the might start asking some questions :P
[15:31:08] <pussipupu> Yeah, occasionally going to the UK to see family is about the limit of my travels
[15:33:09] <pussipupu> Assuming the rules don't change in the mean time there's no reason to think I won't be able to
[15:36:35] <mnemon> yeh
[15:38:30] <pussipupu> and when I have both passports I can use the short queues in the EU and UK#
[15:38:48] <mnemon> useful :)
[15:38:55] <arryana> there's a limit to the days i can be out of the uk, for citizenship
[15:39:00] <arryana> and it's far lower than what i require
[15:39:41] <pussipupu> Yeah, I'm lucky that my situation is compatible with eventually getting citizenship
[15:40:02] <pussipupu> and then Patel can take away my British one next time I say anything mean about the government
[15:40:48] <arryana> haha
[15:40:57] <arryana> once my mother is gone it's possible, if not easy
[15:41:08] <arryana> but as long as she's alive, she has medical and legal issues she can't sort herself.
[15:41:27] <pussipupu> Just move her to Scotland too
[15:41:35] * pussipupu ducks
[15:42:51] <arryana> haha
[15:43:10] <arryana> she's begged me to bring her here, but she's too frail for any travel, even a cruise ship won't take her.
[15:43:16] <arryana> she's oxygen dependant and can't walk.
[15:43:37] <arryana> i checked, i try not to deny her any reasonable or even marginally unreasonable request
[15:44:12] <pussipupu> And cruise ships are serious risk for anyone with respiratory issues when we're still mid plague
[15:45:09] <arryana> yeah
[15:45:29] <arryana> she gets three home hospice visits a day, she's way past the point of travel
[15:45:59] <plank> i took a psychology of death and dying class, really good stuff
[15:46:03] <arryana> trying to arrange for similar care here would be... prohibitive at best
[15:46:06] <plank> the concept of the living will is interesting
[15:46:13] <plank> and of course the DNR
[15:46:23] <arryana> she's had a dnr for fifteen years, she has a do not transport now
[15:46:30] <arryana> they won't even take her to the hospital
[15:46:34] <plank> as is her right
[15:46:37] <arryana> yep
[15:46:50] <arryana> this is why i'm her power of attorney, i'm the only hardass who will enforce it
[15:47:02] <plank> my second cousins mom (or first cousin once removed?) got assisted euthanasia pretty soon after it became legal here
[15:47:02] <arryana> i also refused feeding for my father on his behalf the last ten days.
[15:47:04] <plank> helluva woman
[15:47:17] <arryana> i would take her for that, if it were an option
[15:47:23] <arryana> she'd do it, if i were there to sit with her.
[15:47:24] <plank> yeah stupid christians
[15:47:37] <arryana> eh, my father was catholic, and he still refused food at the end
[15:47:42] <arryana> and instructed me to continue that.
[15:47:45] <plank> always ruining everyones fun
[15:47:50] * arryana shrugs
[15:48:00] <arryana> life shouldn't be held cheap
[15:48:08] <plank> wheres the fun in not eating? sounds miserable
[15:48:17] <plank> a shot of extremely strong painkillers tho?
[15:48:19] <mnemon> we don't have euthanasia as such but for the dying there's painpump + no food
[15:48:20] <plank> sounds awesome
[15:48:20] <arryana> he didn't eat the last two years, he had a trach.
[15:48:25] <arryana> it was through a feeding tube.
[15:48:39] <plank> yeah fuck all that dude
[15:48:53] <plank> i held my cats paw as he died
[15:48:58] <plank> watched the light go out of his eyes
[15:49:09] <arryana> i do the same.  this is why i'm the diceman.
[15:49:16] <plank> diceman or iceman?
[15:49:17] <plank> lol
[15:49:30] <arryana> the responsibility falls to the one who can cope.
[15:49:42] <plank> ice in your veins, right
[15:49:46] <arryana> nope
[15:49:50] <plank> oh?
[15:49:51] <arryana> but i understand the situation.
[15:50:16] <plank> as well as one can, at least
[15:50:17] <arryana> i have feelings like everyone else.  i just recognize when they don't matter.
[15:50:36] <plank> yeah thats the ice
[15:50:39] <pussipupu> I was with three of our cats while they died in the space of a few months
[15:50:44] <arryana> awww
[15:50:52] <plank> if you didnt have feelings youd just be a psychopath
[15:51:18] <pussipupu> I had to be though, the first was sudden and he died in my arms, the other two my spouse couldn't do it so I had to
[15:51:31] <arryana> i'm a fan of sparing people when possible.
[15:51:35] <arryana> you did a good thing.
[15:52:11] <arryana> when my little hacker's greyhound dies, i'll be on the next plane to him.
[15:53:09] <pussipupu> breaks my heart even remembering it to be honest
[15:53:35] <pussipupu> But when there's no choice there's no choice, and I wouldn't be able to let them die with only a stranger for company
[15:56:07] <arryana> aww
[15:56:15] <arryana> yeah, i've been the one to do that since i was 12
