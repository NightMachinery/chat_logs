[01:41:20] -ixelp- Implicit Overflow Considered Harmful (and how to fix it) : ProgrammingLanguages
[01:50:36] <gilberth> Patch 2 is hilarious.
[01:51:38] <hayley> "Look, I made the compiler generate huge code! Never mind that this code also creates "big"nums and uses a crappy object layout."
[01:53:54] <hayley> I am pretty sure the branch predictor would have a very good day if you only give fixnums which don't overflow with addition too. 
[01:55:35] <gilberth> You could say: The problem is that languages are designed considering the CPUs that there are. The world would be nicer the other around.
[01:56:40] <gilberth> And this is a self-inforcing process, when all code is in C, designed for the PDP-11, future CPU designers will design their CPUs to just be some better PDP-11. Rinse and repeat.
[01:58:11] <gilberth> The Lisp machine is interesting in this regard, as this CPU was designed with the giving language in mind. Although the Lisp machine is just a microcoded design.
[01:58:16] <hayley> Nah, you can still do bignums well, c.f. SBCL.
[01:58:54] <hayley> if ((x | y) & 1) { slow path, we have bignums } else { fast path, we have fixnums }
[01:58:56] <gilberth> For course you can, you can even do fixnums well, c.f. CCL.
[01:59:36] <gilberth> Point was: C was designed to match the given CPU well, not the other way around.
[02:00:00] <moon-child> c was designed to match the cpu originally, and then later cpus were designed to match c because it was so popular
[02:00:20] <gilberth> Yes, this is what I tried to say.
[02:00:41] * hayley 's arm still hurts.
[02:01:58] <gilberth> A single cycle fixnum/fixnum addition right in the ALU with a fast trap on non-fixnums or overflow would be trivial to have. You could even do mixed flonum/fixnums in a cycle. Just do fixnum addition, flonum addition, type check and overflow check in parallel in HW right at the ALU.
[02:02:30] <gilberth> hayley: You sound like a male. It'll pass, for sure.

[02:03:03] <hayley> That could be a problem, as I am still in bed.
[02:03:29] <gilberth> You need to move your arms while asleep?

[02:13:28] <Gnuxie> You have to find good people for group work or you die 
[02:13:32] <hayley> It's all waterfall too: you spend half the time writing a spec, and then document at the end. So no time to hack.

[02:15:06] <selwyn> yeah
[02:15:12] <hayley> How hard can writing an auto-vectoriser be though? There's already papers on it, and it's more or less reordering instructions until you get a few you like in a row.
[02:15:13] <Gnuxie> You can just pretend and write the spec after 
[02:15:17] <gilberth> Some [private] projects with a friend of mine, were fun. We would split the task and just spec the interface between those parts and then come back together to stick our parts together. Worked fine, most of the time.

[02:22:04] <selwyn> white_flame: yes and yes
[02:22:17] <hayley> Well, vectorising compiler or a pauseless GC. What do people want first?
[02:22:31] <selwyn> the people want bins without wheels
[02:22:49] <mfiano> depends on the variant and tradeoffs pauseless implies
[02:22:56] <White_Flame> also, remember when suitcases didn't have wheels?  that sucked
[02:23:19] <White_Flame> meanwhile, pilots did have rolling ones but nobody else did
[02:23:23] <gilberth> hayley: I don't care for a vectorising compiler. It's a waste of effort.
[02:23:27] <Gnuxie> Bin men apparently be getting paid alright these days 
[02:23:59] <GreaseMonkey> vectorising compilers are probably still nice, but pauseless GC definitely helps deal to the worst case
[02:24:18] <hayley> mfiano: MVP would be a unigenerational concurrent compacting collector with a read barrier (capital-p Pauseless by the paper).

[02:25:54] <mfiano> hayley: too many buzzwords, not enough numbers
[02:26:20] <selwyn> no city likes to try to fight its own garbage collectors
[02:26:25] <hayley> Those are precisely defined terms in garbage collection and not really buzzwords, but basically "see how ZGC performs".
[02:27:09] <moon-child> MVP sure sounds a lot like a buzzword
[02:27:28] <hayley> "Minimum viable product"? I don't think that has ever made anyone happy.
[02:27:46] <GreaseMonkey> MVP is a dangerous term but it does show intent
[02:28:00] <White_Flame> or Most Valuable Player, if you're talking about the best implementation
[02:28:18] <hayley> Given I only have one semester, and have to do stupid things like planning... 
[02:28:49] <GreaseMonkey> and you can also go "this is the minimum that would technically satisfy constraints, so if we can implement that then we have something we can improve from"
[02:29:14] <GreaseMonkey> it plays quite nicely into the "make it work, make it good, make it fast" mantra of optimisation
[02:29:40] <GreaseMonkey> go as far as you like as long as you remember to make it at least somewhat reasonable

[03:31:10] <copec> PAIP AI techniques are all symbolic 
[03:31:18] <mfiano> ok thanks. which one do you recommend reading first?

[03:31:48] * mfiano throws out the bot theory
[03:32:23] <edgar-rft> good questions get good answers, shitty questions get shitty answers...
[03:33:06] <copec> I rather enjoyed PAIP, but it doesn’t really apply to any popular deep learning techniques 
[03:33:14] <mfiano> I had PAIP and just got AIAMA. Deciding on which to start with
[03:33:41] <copec> What do you want to get out of it?
[03:34:23] <copec> I would do both at the same time
[03:35:09] <mfiano> Hmm, good question. I'm not really into ML, moreso traditional AI and constraint solvers. I guess I'm just trying to get a little more experience in traditional AI than my self explored methods
[03:36:03] <edgar-rft> mfiano: I think the most important think I learned from PAIP is manual memory management techniques in Common Lisp (memory pools, memoisation, etc.)
[03:36:54] <edgar-rft> the AI techniques in PAIP are not really new but easy enough for learning
[03:37:13] <mfiano> edgar-rft: Oh neat. I play with those techniques frequently in game development, but the code is self-explored and not really backed by existing techniques, so I might learn what I've been doing wrong.
[03:39:22] <mfiano> Basically, I don't read enough about these topics, and I'm not one to mindlessly copy/paste from SO or the like. All of my code is mostly self-explored algorithms from much trial and error.
[03:39:33] <mfiano> Well most of it anyway
[03:42:08] <edgar-rft> mfiano: for complicated problems it's hard to tell an optimal strategy in advance, it's often a try-rewrite-repeat loop until you found what works best, that's abolutely normal. I tried a lot of programming languages and one reason why I got stuck with Common Lisp is that it's much easier to refactor and rewrite the code than in C for example.
[03:42:57] <mfiano> Absolutely, except I would go a step farther and replace C with even Python. That is where I came from about 20 years ago.
[03:45:47] <mfiano> I had a few years of Python experience when a friend recommended CL to me. I read a book and in roughly 2 weeks I was more efficiently cranking out ideas than Python. I think that says a lot, considering that is one thing Python boasts; RAD.
[03:46:21] <gilberth> Hmm. CLS, the packet opcode to close a connection, is an uncontrolled packet and optional. The AIM says, would be nice to send, but optional, a host may just stop responding to a connection. That is: Transmission of CLS is not ACKed an hence there is no way to actually close a connection in that way, that both parties agree on that.
[03:48:01] <gilberth> Though there is an EOF marker, that could be send.
[03:49:20] <mfiano> edgar-rft: But, I recently discovered that my interests are not really in game development, but more closer to AI: constraint solvers, texture synthesis, generative art, mathematical simulations, etc, so I am prioritizing some books to read.
[03:49:59] <moon-child> mfiano: haven't you been working on game stuff for years now?

[03:52:08] <mfiano> Yes, I program mostly to learn and to satisfy passing curiosities, not to create some end product. As such I have been working on a game engine for some years, but find more interest in the low-level algorithms and architecture around it, not in writing a game. I am more interested in using a game engine/renderer for visualizing AI algorithms and the like I realize now.
[03:52:35] <moon-child> https://twitter.com/trav_downs/status/1445481246033776641  this reminds me of cliffc's comments on inlining vs register allocation
[03:53:21] <moon-child> and solidifies my perception that if an inner loop deserves to be optimized _that much_, it deserves to be written in assembly
[03:53:50] <edgar-rft> mfiano: PAIP uses rather stoneage AI examples from the 1960..80s (Eliza etc.), most AI books for games and art today are using C++ examples. But you can use the CL techniques from PAIP to implement the C++ examples in Lisp :-)
[03:54:20] <hayley> That's true. I found I got better register allocation if I gave (FUNCALL CONTINUATION) in generated DFA code its own TAGBODY label.
[03:54:27] <mfiano> edgar-rft: Good to know. How "stoneage" is AIAMA then?
[03:55:14] <moon-child> (or, idk, maybe djb's thing.  qhasm I think)
[03:55:17] <hayley> HotSpot C2 is designed to be robust w.r.t over-inlining apparently. And the SICL register allocator is sort of localised, as it uses estimated-distance-to-use to be careful about what to spill.
[03:56:05] <hayley> "it often pays off to put the core loop for some computational function into its own function and disable inlining it. This tells the compiler: use all the registers for this loop only." I think the SICL register allocator will do just this, as the hot loop has a lesser distance than anything else.
[03:57:02] <edgar-rft> mfiano: the newest AIMA I have is the 2nd edition that describes AI from the early 2000s, the newer versions are probably even more up-to-date.
[03:57:36] <mfiano> Ah ok. I have 4e from last year, but have not done more than skim the TOC and noticed lots i don't know about.
[03:58:11] <mfiano> But as AI itself is pretty new to me (outside my self-invented) stuff, that doesn't say much

[05:22:29] <gilberth> I should get some wires here. My machines are on wifi, pinging at a 40cm distance takes 100ms, pinging the about 100km to gilberth.org takes 13ms. That cannot be right.

[05:30:32] <hayley> Too bad I don't play on it. Last time I went back someone said "oh, well, this server isn't for girls" and I decided I agreed.
[05:30:33] <gilberth> My DSL lines are not fast enough for such a fast ping.
[05:31:35] <gilberth> These lines are optimized for bandwidth not for speed. As in: For watching TV^WNetflix you don't need a low latency.
[05:33:07] <gilberth> Packets are interleaved somehow. At my previous**2 home there was an option to ask to turn it off, and I had <5ms ping, although the line was worse in general.
[05:33:53] <gilberth> Ironically I get better pings when using LTE. But then: It's only 2GB/_month_.

[12:37:20] <pl> selwyn: in practice you need to recentralize it somehow, how exactly it then works depends on how you do it
[12:37:31] <pl> because there's a lot of specialist hospitals that make no sense in small regions
[12:37:38] <selwyn> yes
[12:37:56] <pl> the problem with NHS decentralisation is that afaik it cut apart the catchment areas for specialized care
[12:38:03] <selwyn> oh
[12:38:14] <selwyn> can´t you get a referral to a different region anymore?
[12:38:35] <selwyn> like for great ormond st. or sth
[12:39:33] <pl> selwyn: it's less about referrals, and more about funding etc.
[12:39:49] <pl> essentially, economies of scale are merciless
[12:40:11] <selwyn> i see
[12:40:30] <pl> also, in Poland, we end up with a patchwork of hospitals where you don't ever know where a certain service might be, and uncontrolled drop in quality etc.
[12:40:40] <selwyn> :/
[12:40:44] <pl> because the county seat wanted a hospital instead of ambulatorium etc.
[12:41:09] <pl> and it's easy to justify building up the hospital, but then there's not enough resources to keep it relevant/quality etc.

[13:45:44] <selwyn> if rents aren´t as high then a lot of problems are half sorted
[13:46:13] <hayley> Oh, and welfare was about 1/2 of that, so I'm saying rent was 4/3 of welfare here.
[13:46:21] <selwyn> oh
[13:46:26] <selwyn> isnt there separate housing benefit?
[13:47:05] <hayley> True, I haven't checked that. But OTOH that apartment was part of a government scheme and it was damn tiny.
[13:47:48] <selwyn> well
[13:48:01] <selwyn> 2/3 is probably not achievable
[13:48:03] <hayley> Even if welfare were doubled, and it's probably not, then you'd still have to pay for other things to live with. Would suck to be out of a job.

[13:52:24] <shka> selwyn: the issue is, frankly, the CAPITAL
[13:52:28] <selwyn> pl: am reminded that having a summer house was not remarkable in soviet times yet in england it is a sign of considerable wealth

[13:54:02] <pl> especially when you add in modern manufacturing methods

[14:02:16] <hayley> Gotta say, the thumbnail looks more high quality than the video.
[14:02:44] <shka> anyway the paradox of the housing market is that it is used as the investment tool
[14:03:18] <shka> construction costs are not the major driver of the prices
[14:03:24] <selwyn> yes
[14:03:28] <shka> it is the demand steered up by investors
[14:03:45] <shka> and that demand is because of expected high prices

[14:07:42] <shka> yes, but it makes matters worse

[15:16:45] <gilberth> But then, when the coffee sits a while a parenthesis can turn curly, which would have the opposite effect. Not good.
[15:19:47] <dave0> do we shun curly brackets?

[15:32:02] <gilberth> This LAN I have here sure is unreliable.
[15:38:00] <gilberth> Any idea how I could efficiently generate a random number asserting that it is not in a given set?
[15:38:54] <hayley> Map all the numbers outside the set to 0..n?
[15:40:46] <gilberth> Sure, is that efficient? Perhaps I could keep a size of the set of not to roll numbers k and take random(n-_k_) then go over the set in a linear fashion to map that to [0;n) again. When needed I could keep the set as a tree, but a linear list will do for me.
[15:41:26] <gilberth> OTOH It might be easier to just roll an n-sided dice as often as needed.
[15:42:36] <gilberth> I need a map from those number, which are index aka port numbers, anyway.
[15:45:05] <gilberth> But I am paranoid, they don't need to be random technically. But being predicable would allow for an attacker to inject false packets with high probability of success.
[15:46:10] <gilberth> And in effect hijacking an existing connection.
[15:46:53] <hayley> How many do you intend to have in flight anyway?
[15:47:26] <dave0> a nice brute force way is to generate all possible values you want in an array and shuffle the array
[15:47:33] <gilberth> In flight? Few.
[15:47:54] <dave0> the only way i know for random numbers is rejection sampling
[15:48:14] <gilberth> But this is all theoretical I don't expect the world switching to Chaosnet and people doing sensitive stuff on it.
[15:48:23] <hayley> Eh, can't you afford to pick one and check if it's in the set, then try again if it is?
[15:48:36] <dave0> hayley: that's rejection sampling

[16:05:32] <gilberth> I need to figure out some real world (IP) networking, too. I wanted to do with a map from Chaosnet hosts to internet hosts, but when I look up a host name, I often get both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, while only IPv4 somehow reaches outside. So how the hell should I guess which one to use to send Chaosnet packets with UDP?
[16:09:24] <gilberth> I am bit surpised as the LAN here actually uses IPv6 too, it's just that it doesn't reach outside. I wonder why.

[16:18:23] <Duuqnd> Something about keyboard enthusiasts I don't get is why they always seem to want fewer keys. I want more keys!
[16:19:40] <shka> well, i personally want fewer keys so keyboard is smaller, so i have more space for a macropad, or something
[16:19:46] <shka> also, easier to carry
[16:20:35] <shka> and i use split layouts, they tend to use a lot of desk when halves are apart 
[16:20:42] <shka> so less buttons helps to mitgate that
[16:21:27] <gilberth> I cannot imagine to use a split keyboard.
[16:21:55] <selwyn> shka: how many keyboards do you have
[16:22:01] <Duuqnd> I think the Lisp machine keyboards had the right idea. Keys for all the things you need (and some you don't) to use the system efficiently as well as an extra modifier key reserved for user keybindings along with the triangle, square and circle keys, also reserved for the user.
[16:22:07] <shka> selwyn: to many, lol
[16:22:18] <shka> but i won't be buying another one!
[16:22:43] <shka> Duuqnd: yeah, it is the right idea IMHO
[16:22:56] <shka> they could have more of those user keys 
[16:23:10] <hayley> I watched myself and I can't really touch type still, I just use my pointer and middle fingers mostly.
[16:23:22] <hayley> But no one complains about 130 WPM.
[16:23:24] <gilberth> As I am an expert in spilling beverages over the keyboard I always have some in stock. I guess it's about six keyboards or so. All the same.
[16:23:38] <hayley> Otherwise I don't really care about keyboards, idk.
[16:23:48] <gilberth> Not counting the non-PC keyboards for my museum pieces.
[16:25:50] <gilberth> Duuqnd: I am not a fan of dozens of function keys. I prefer my keyboard being small and am comfortable with modifier keys.

[16:27:13] <Duuqnd> I don't think that the Symbolics keyboard were perfect (arrow keys would've been nice), but I do think they were on the right path, especially with having the Hyper key reserved for the user
[16:27:19] <gilberth> One thing that I really miss with the Apple is a distinction between alt used as a modifier and alt used to reach a second keymap level. This idiotic behavior could only have been invented by a non-Emacs user, or an american, or both.
[16:28:00] * gilberth prefers c-f, c-b, c-n, c-p over the arrow keys. Don't leave your home position.

[16:29:11] <Duuqnd> Many old computers and systems really give off this "yup, this is American" feel. Especially the whole pretending other languages don't exist thing.
[16:29:21] <gilberth> pl: Perhaps. Even with a keymap editor I found no way to have the right alt for the added level of keymapping for accented characters and alt for meta or option or command or whatever you call it. Emacs could be configured that way, but that is not universal.
