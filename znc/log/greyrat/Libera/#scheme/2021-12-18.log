[01:49:12] <gwatt> dpk: Ideally, the procedure name looks the same as the name given to defn. If I give up on that then I don't need construct a name for the procedure at all.
[01:49:30] <dpk> oh, you just want the macroexpansion to look pretty
[01:50:03] <dpk> imo a good implementation of generate-temporaries should reuse the symbolic name of each item in the list if it's an identifier or a symbol
[01:50:15] <dpk> unfortunately, you can guess how many good implementations of generate-temporaries there are

[01:53:06] <dpk> you could *make* #'scope a pattern variable

[01:53:27] <gwatt> Hmm, maybe
[01:53:44] <dpk> maybe i should add generate-identifier to syntax-case-extensions, if that worksÂ â€¦
[01:55:35] <dpk> what's odd is that datum->syntax works for me in Chez with a non-pattern variable as the first argument
[01:55:37] <gwatt> unsyntax still says out of phase
[01:56:01] <dpk> i've never been able to build Unsyntax, and the Schemers Docket image is quite old i think

[01:59:17] <dpk> (may need to be stx-car, not car)
[01:59:26] <dpk> (just to add another level of bizarritude)
[02:01:25] <gwatt> afaik, there's no requirement that the first argument to datum->syntax come from a pattern, just that it's an identifier syntax-object.

[02:06:37] <gwatt> ok, it might be a repl issue

[16:50:31] <mdhughes> I have another computer in another room with a bigger screen. Sometimes I go out into a "yard" to play with the dog, but mostly dog sleeps on my feet by the computers.

[17:08:53] <amazigh> I do not like booze, and I drink too much coffee. I think I will try taoism... or something.
[17:09:09] <wasamasa> I took a caffeine pill yesterday for work and I was disappointed I couldn't really tell whether it did its thing or not
[17:09:31] <wasamasa> I thought after a long break of not drinking yerba mate I'd be fine
[17:10:25] <wasamasa> maybe it's only good for staying up longer
[17:12:11] <amazigh> it is not about energy I can wake up at 7h and stay awake until 22h or 23h or something.
[17:12:31] <amazigh> The problem is I keep pilling up toy project, and I am tired of to that
[17:12:38] <mdhughes> Check the mg dosage. Coffee's about 120-180 mg a cup. One pill might not be significant.
[17:13:28] <mdhughes> It's not so much energy as focus. Caffeine pushes me from bored to excited to work on top project.
[17:13:54] <amazigh> on some other channel, some told me it is completly ok to go from projects to projects, in an infinite spotless mind way.
[17:14:08] <wasamasa> I went for 100mg in the morning, then 100mg for lunch
[17:14:19] <amazigh> they even wrote "it is normal"
[17:14:20] <wasamasa> I used to do 100mg after work at the hackerspace
[17:15:00] <amazigh> i call myself /nick bunnycoder
[17:15:09] <wasamasa> that is, two cans of volt cola
