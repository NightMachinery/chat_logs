[01:06:58] <Pi-sistance> ok well done, im still to stupid to get it lol
[01:07:17] <Pi-sistance> and why is there a constant of integration for a definite integral
[01:07:31] <dila> if you graph it, the negative "piece" is the same as the positive piece, just mirrored. so that doesn't change the value of the integral
[01:07:44] <Pi-sistance> ah, fuck it. ill just remembr to always split the damn abs functions up
[01:07:47] <dila> yes, i might have made a mistake about including +C
[01:08:05] <bildramer> that can happen
[01:08:09] <dila> i think wolfram alpha prefers closed form solutions. so it includes the sgn(x)
[01:08:19] <bildramer> imagine integrating 1/x to get ln(x) from -1 to 1
[01:08:30] <dila> yes, i love it
[01:08:32] <bildramer> sorry, ln(abs(x))
[01:08:49] <dila> well for a start you can write 1/x as x^-1 as exp(-ln(x))
[01:08:53] <bildramer> well whoops, there's a singularity in the middle, so it's actually ln(abs(x)) + c_1 if x<0, ln(x) + c_2 if x>0

[01:17:47] <tusko> year 1?
[01:18:38] <dila> for me the difficult part about matrices is they are non-commutative
[01:18:43] <tusko> You're doing fourier in year 1 of an engineering degree?
[01:19:18] <dila> so (A+B)^2 = A^2 + AB + BA + B^2 does not collaps to A^2 + 2AB + B^2
[01:19:20] <kakuhen> dila: a nice way to intuit why they can be non-commutative is to consider isometries represented as 2x2 matrices
[01:19:58] <kakuhen> label the four vertices of a square, rotate it, and then flip it horizontally, you get some different configuration of numbers right

[10:36:39] <krator44> anyway yea its a trick

[10:37:39] <krator44> thats the extent of my linear algebra knowledge
[10:38:03] <Galois> it makes sense if you think about projective coordinates. The final step in the transformation is the conversion from projective to affine coordinates.

[10:38:33] <em> tomorrow I will be more rested and I can consider being more flexible.
[10:38:46] <Galois> in which case calling it a "projection matrix" is not so far-fetched, since projective coordinates really are a legitimate concept in math
[10:39:10] <dila> it's really a projection operation. the matrix doesn't do the projection
[10:39:14] <krator44> em: maybe tomorrow you can ask about lambda calculus
[10:39:29] <krator44> i know you will hate it
[10:39:29] <Galois> I agree "projective matrix" would be more accurate, I'm just saying it's not outlandishly wrong
[10:39:46] <dila> well it's bad in my opinion because there are projection matrices
[10:39:53] <Galois> it's like someone saying "elliptical curve" instead of the correct "elliptic curve"
[10:40:11] <dila> i don't see it as being a semantic issue
[10:40:48] <Galois> it kind of is. The operation is a projection (it's a projective map), and it is a matrix (on projective coordinates), it's just not a projection matrix
[10:41:25] <dila> why does the projective map need a matrix involved at all?
[10:41:40] <Galois> it doesn't, hence I separated the two

[10:42:09] <kmh> convenience rather requirement
[10:44:06] <krator44> ah
[10:44:12] <krator44> it really doesnt need a matrix
[10:44:19] <krator44> the reason that its used is that
[10:44:20] <dila> a projection onto a plane leaves vectors in the plane unchanged: Ax = x for some x
[10:44:25] <dila> A is a projection matrix
[10:44:38] <krator44> the entire transformation can be writte as x' = projection * camera * x
[10:44:55] <krator44> then x' = (projection * camera) * x
[10:45:01] <dila> you're forgetting the non-linear projective map that we just talked about
[10:45:02] <krator44> and we save on matrix multiplication
[10:45:11] <dila> you can't achieve foreshortening with a linear map
[10:46:46] <krator44> remember that in 3d graphics we have (projection * camera) constant and thousands or millions of x's

[13:58:55] <mh_le> dauggy: it does not need to be continuous

[13:59:14] <mh_le> assumptions*
[14:00:37] <dauggy> hmm, so in fact I got to show that a sub-linear function mus be continous on (0, inf). I though it suffices to use it's monoton increasing property
[14:01:01] <quarterback> Are there any online plot websites which can plot curves such as y=f(x) in xy plane?
[14:01:13] <dauggy> what I know about my function is:
[14:01:23] <dauggy> 1) it's monton increasing
[14:01:57] <dauggy> 2) psi(delta) / delta is monoton decreasing (it's simply always less than a linear function)
[14:02:05] <dauggy> that's the whole definition
[14:02:20] <dauggy> I guess there's not much I can get from the 2nd point
[14:02:32] <dauggy> so I thought I need to rely on the 1st one

[14:17:56] <dauggy> rubiksdream: yes, it is nonnegative
[14:19:04] <rubiksdream> okay, so say a \in (0,+inf) is a point of discontinuity
[14:19:33] <rubiksdream> that means either the left hand limit is less than psi(a), or psi(a) is less than the right hand limit
[14:21:43] <rubiksdream> in the first case, psi(x)/x is decreasing to psi(a-)/a as x -> a-, and psi(a)/a is larger than psi(a-)/a, so we violate condition 2)
[14:22:27] <dauggy> Give me a sec to parse it
[14:26:03] <rubiksdream> in the second case, there is still a violation, because assuming lim_{x -> a-} psi(x) = psi(a), we have psi(a) < lim_{x->a+} psi(x), and psi(x)/x decreases to psi(a)/a as x->a, but then suddenly increases, since lim_{x->a+} psi(x)/x = psi(a+)/a > psi(a)/a
[14:26:28] <rubiksdream> *and psi(x)/x decreases to psi(a)/a as x->a-, but then suddenly ...

[15:18:25] <rubiksdream> isn't that 'deforming' thing normally not proved?
[15:18:41] <rubiksdream> like how would you show (without jordan-schnoeflies) that you can deform a jordan curve to a circle
[15:18:53] <rubiksdream> (ignoring the homology point of view for now which I am yet to read)
[15:19:26] <rubiksdream> or some textbooks (even fairly advanced ones) just do not prove the general case, for a jordan curve enclosing the point of interest

[15:22:44] <rubiksdream> oh, I thought by homologous you meant the homology groups are the same in all dimensions
[15:22:58] <rubiksdream> and in this case then only dimension 0,1 matter
[15:22:58] <johnkeats7> no, you think of the curves as chains
[15:23:09] <johnkeats7> so homologous means 'they represent the same thing in homology'
[15:23:32] <rubiksdream> and that doesn't mean their homology groups are the same?
[15:23:51] <johnkeats7> no, it has nothing to do with the homology groups of the curves, it's the homology of the space they are in
[15:24:07] <johnkeats7> they need to represent the same element in that
[15:24:18] <rubiksdream> oh I see
[15:25:19] <johnkeats7> rubiksdream, at the end it's really just stokes' theorem. f(z) is holomorphic <=> d/dzbar f = 0, and then d(f(z) dz) = (df/dzbar) dzbar /\ dz = 0. so it's closed, and by stokes if your curves bound a region then the integral over the curves = integral of d(f(z)dz) over the region = 0.
[15:25:24] <rubiksdream> right, you're saying that as 1-chains, z,w, z-w is partial(U) where U is a 2-chain
[15:25:32] <rubiksdream> and this is working in some ambient space
[15:25:34] <rubiksdream> where z,w sit
[15:26:31] <johnkeats7> the only reason this doesn't perfectly work is that stokes needs C^2 functions, and you don't want to assume a priori that holomorphic functions are C^2. so you have to re-do it in a more complicated way
[15:27:04] <rubiksdream> you could assume that apriori i think, it follows from cauchys integral formula for a disk

[15:44:19] <tolarz> johnkeats7: cool blog post

[15:47:51] <tolarz> hmhm

[15:59:41] <rubiksdream> yup, same guy
[16:00:04] <rubiksdream> i think its a pretty decent book, it proves some interesting somewhat nonstandard results
[16:00:27] <rubiksdream> e.g. looman-menchoff in the first chapter, via pretty much elementary arguments(as long as you are okay with absolutely continuous functions/lebesgue integration theory)
[16:00:58] <rubiksdream> and has exercises
[16:01:33] <johnkeats7> what i've heard of the riemann surfaces book is that it's more analytical and less algebraic than the counterparts like miranda
[16:01:38] <johnkeats7> so it's probably good for you

[20:57:14] <em> Yeah. Being able to explain more relationships also seems like a signature of learning and that comes closer to 'understanding' maybe.

[20:58:02] <rubiksdream> right, at least we as humans would like to think that we 'understand', i hope the resolution to the hard problem of consciousness isn't something like, 'it doesn't exist' lol, that would be unsettling

[21:00:21] <coeus> I still think I'm right because intuition comes from experience dealing with numerous problems that have easy solutions
[21:00:59] <elf_fortrez> easy is not simple, trivial is not simple either
[21:01:34] <rubiksdream> coeus i dont think what you wrote is a satisfying definition of learning, that isn't to say it can't be valid, just that its obviously not the whole picture

[22:44:41] <rubiksdream> so is a graph (V,E) given by a V x V matrix? |V|^2 inputs?
[22:45:28] <elf_fortrez> @dila I don't know the QR format but (mod 2) gives two QRs
[22:45:57] <dila> elf_fortrez: i'm not sure what you mean. if you sum the images (e.g. using a image software XOR blend)
[22:46:02] <Oberon4278> I'm not the best at graphs, but the pathfinding algorithm in question is for a game played on a flat board with square tiles, and units can move into adjacent tiles in any direction including diagonal.
[22:46:41] <Oberon4278> So each vertex would have 8... edges?
[22:46:43] <elf_fortrez> XOR is AND
[22:46:48] <dila> nonsense
[22:47:12] <rubiksdream> okay, in that case 2|E| = 8|V|
[22:47:41] <Oberon4278> and there is no weight or cost associated with the tiles; none of them take longer to move through than others
[22:48:01] <rubiksdream> right

[22:49:14] <rubiksdream> in other words what pert says
[22:49:22] <rubiksdream> your algo is O(nlogn) where n = |V| or |E|
[22:49:40] <Oberon4278> awesome, thank you
[22:49:57] <Oberon4278> now I just have to dig through heuristics
[22:50:01] <rubiksdream> you can probably figure out what that factor is
[22:50:06] <rubiksdream> since you have the degree of each vertex
[22:50:40] <Oberon4278> what do you mean?
[22:51:06] <rubiksdream> its probably not important, but I mean the actual constant C s.t. runtime(n) <= C*n

[23:55:13] <amirouche> sorry, my formal notation is wrong, they can be both false, but they are never true at the same time.
