[00:01:22] <ngortheone> maybe a random question: what stands in the way of separating UI from  backend logic? In other words - what prevents the existence of "libneomutt"
[00:01:25] <ngortheone> ?
[00:01:46] <flatcap> I was cheered by a recent "quote of the day" ...
[00:01:55] <flatcap> We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
[00:02:15] <ngortheone> so true
[00:02:58] <ngortheone> Somewhat related quote that I often remember "You can do anything, but not everything"
[00:03:18] <flatcap> I still need to separate the Index and Pager -- I've been (willfully) getting distracted for too long
[00:03:31] <flatcap> hehe, I like that
[00:04:13] <flatcap> with the pager and index separate, then we can de-dupe all the op_xyz() functions
[00:04:36] <flatcap> e.g. index, pager and compose all have an op_print() that works on attachments
[00:07:20] <ngortheone> Hopefully this year I will have a bit more free time, I want to finish the job killing TOPLINE and friends, and decouple pager
[00:07:55] <flatcap> I hope so.  I could do with more people around who have some understanding :-)

[19:05:10] <b2ag> happy new year @all, I have a noob question for you guys. when I want to compose a new mail I usally do a ":exec mail" because I didn't find a good key for it yet. Then I'm asked for the "to" address but when I paste in a email like name <email@example.org> the first "<" is interpreted by neomutt and effectivly vanishes. Can you explain what is going on and how to disable this behavior?

[19:16:43] <b2ag> yes
[19:17:00] <b2ag> I just noticed it does not happen in a default configuration of neomutt
[19:17:08] <jindraj> I'm not able to reproduce any misbehaviour… b2ag what version of neomutt are you running?

[19:33:47] <b2ag> "bind editor" means keyboard binding configuration for the internal editor component, right? I'm using vim as editor so I guess the lines where useless.
[19:37:47] <flatcap> yes, the "editor" is the one-line text entry field at the bottom of the screen
[19:38:29] <b2ag> I tried "bind editor \C<Backspace> kill-word" and "... \C<Delete> kill-eow" but deleting whole words still does not work in "to"-prompt. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

[19:39:00] <flatcap> works for Ctrl-H and Ctrl-Backspace
[19:39:39] <flatcap> NeoMutt doesn't understand <Delete> and <Backspace> so it's assuming you mean the chars '<' 'D' etc

[20:48:44] <jindraj> I see neomutt doesn't use readline, everything is implemented on it's own. I'm just wondering whether neomutt could benefit from readline. editing, completion, history… Sure there would be issues to address like conflicts between readline config from inputrc vs neomutt bindings. mapping editor commands should be placed into INPUTRC file even as global or inside condition `$if neomutt …
[20:48:47] <jindraj> $endif`. Please don't consider this as a feature request, I'm just thinking aloud :)
[20:54:51] <flatcap> hehe, yes neomutt would benefit from outsourcing the text entry
