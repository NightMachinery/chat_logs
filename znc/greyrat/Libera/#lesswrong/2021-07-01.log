[00:50:24] <meowcat> speaking of people named william, there's always hofstadter's parody of william safire's concern about gendered language. https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html
[00:50:25] <Robomot> Douglas Hofstadter - Person Paper on Purity in Language
[00:51:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the same op-ed, Buckley concluded that as long as African Americans remained “backward” in education and in economic progress, Southern whites had a right to “impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to affect a genuine cultural equality between the races.”" ... I mean, it seems like this is at least an obvious mechanism for a change in policy preferences
[00:52:00] <meowcat> sure, one might ask whether the southern white elites actually aimed at that. see also booker t. washington.
[00:52:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Black people are inferior and should be governed by white people for as long as they remain inferior" seems like a coherent position, and a later "... aha, black people have achieved equality, and thus can now participate in government, good job" seems like a perfectly consistent continuation of that
[00:52:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> *achieved equality of education and capability and so on, that is
[00:53:05] <meowcat> all the recent fights about race and politics happened before; it's just that a lot of people have been underinformed about the state of the existing literature.
[00:53:20] <meowcat> like, 
[00:53:40] <meowcat> all the stuff about black education was a thing when it was a question of whether black people should be able to be doctors or lawyers
[00:53:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> meowcat: Almost certainly the Southern white elites did *not* aim at that, but my point is just that no "change of heart" or any other sort of transformation of opinion on Buckley's part is needed to explain his changing policy-level views
[00:54:09] <meowcat> sure, he could have just acquired better information
[00:54:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even that isn't needed
[00:54:23] <meowcat> or the circumstances changed in a direction he didn't expect
[00:54:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[00:54:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or not even that
[00:54:45] <meowcat> which is to say, anyone today who's relying on Early Buckley is avoiding evidence
[00:54:55] <meowcat> because Late Buckley already factored in that evidence
[00:55:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> It could *just* be "X will remain the case until Y happens", and later: "Y has happened, and thus X is no longer the case, just like I always said"
[00:55:06] <saturn2> if education and capability is what's important, why does he find it necessary to average the education and capability over everyone with a certain skin color

[00:55:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> meowcat: My point is that another possibility is: circumstances changed in a direction he *did* expect
[00:56:09] <meowcat> i dunno. my engineer dad and my math-major mom got into arguments about how i should be informed about race
[00:56:46] <meowcat> so my judgment on this sort of thing is basically "um, who's trying to not have the conversation? they be sus."
[00:57:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: As a conservative, probably he places a great emphasis on community(ies), so for him, the average (or mode, perhaps) is indeed what matters
[00:58:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., Buckley might say (I am speculating here) that if there exist some black Nobel prize winners, that's great for them, but does not materially impact the question of whether black American communities ought to govern themselves, for which the relevant consideration is the distribution of intelligence / education / whatever in said communities
[00:59:07] <feep> spacex deployments about to start
[00:59:13] <feep> 31 satellite deployments in this ride, jesus.
[00:59:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed, the notion that if there's some very smart individuals, then we should have those individuals do the governing and make the decisions for everyone else (whose intelligence and capabilities don't matter because they just do what the smart guys say)... is pretty much the position Buckley hated most
[01:01:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I suspect he would be very much against the idea of "Alice, who is black, escaped the ghetto, went to Harvard, and now works as a faceless public policy bureaucrat where she decides how said ghetto is governed"
[01:02:26] *** Joins: Thurl (~Nivim@184.99.33.147)
[01:02:29] <saturn2> what does it mean for a community to govern itself?
[01:03:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's certainly a question that conservatives treat in a semi-magical way, yeah
[01:03:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not in a racially biased manner, though, I don't think
[01:04:00] <meowcat> We might ask, "Do most of the exchanges that community members engage in seem fair to most community members?" but this assumes free-trade and democracy.
[01:04:26] <saturn2> maybe they want everyone in the community to think exactly the same way, so they automatically always do the same things
[01:04:34] <meowcat> "my dad works for Mr. Jones, but Mr. Jones doesn't always pay him on payday"
[01:04:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I mean, there's a practical sense in which a community can govern itself, i.e. the stuff T. Greer's written about, but, like, that kind of local organization is dead ... though it might not have been dead in 1955
[01:05:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that Putnam's thesis, in fact? "Bowling Alone" and all that?
[01:05:15] <meowcat> "so i don't know if working for pay is actually fair. it would be if my dad got paid every payday, but sometimes Mr. Jones tells him that the money is somewhere else."
[01:07:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: In short, "solving various coordination problems and conflicts", would be the pithy way of putting it, and if the organizations and institutions that do that *for* the community are also *in* the community, rather than being provided / imposed from without, then that's "self-government" of the sort that conservatives care about
[01:07:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> In other words, it's not really about sovereignty
[01:08:26] <saturn2> that makes sense, i suppose

[01:39:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, in Classic, there's a particular type of game mechanic, which goes like this: let's say you get together with 39 other people and go kill some big ol' dragon (e.g. Onyxia). You chop off her head, and lug it back to your faction's capital city (e.g. Stormwind) and present it proudly to your leaders, and they reward you for your service to your people, etc. Nothing unusual so far.

[01:41:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> BUT, when you turn in that item (the Head of Onyxia), *another* thing that happens is that a certain NPC does a zone-wide message - "Behold, people of Stormwind, So-and-so has vanquished Onyxia!" - and at that moment, all characters currently in Stormwind immediately gain a 2-hour-duration "buff" (beneficial spell effect) that greatly increases their combat statistics and power.

[01:44:02] <Obormot\Arcturus>  *always* try to have *all* your raid members be present in Stormwind when etc. etc.
[01:44:29] <two2thehead> hm TIL spite sensitivity (the worry that others are willing to incur a loss to hurt you), 
[01:44:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem, however, is that if I go kill Onyxia with my buddies, and get her head, well, that can sit in my inventory indefinitely (it doesn't, like, rot or anything...); I can turn it in at any time whatsoever.
[01:45:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Furthermore, there's an additional mechanic whereby if someone does this (turn in a dragon head), no one else can do it for six hours.
[01:45:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> How to predict when someone will turn one in? How to arrange for all your raiders to be logged in, and in Stormwind, when someone turns in a dragon head?
[01:46:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> You'd have to somehow ... make sure that anyone who turns in a dragon head does it at a specific time, every day.
[01:46:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> You'd have to make sure that no one *else* does so, at *any* time in the preceding six hours!

[01:46:57] <Robomot> Are ‘Heat Pumps’ the Answer to Heat Waves? Some Cities Think So. - The New York Times (Electric heat pumps are a way to cool and heat homes at a much lower carbon cost than traditional air-conditioners and furnaces.)
[01:47:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> You'd have to have cooperation from *every raiding guild on the server*, not just positive participation - "someone turns in a head at such a time" - but refraining from defection - "no one turn in a head prior to that time"!
[01:47:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, the server I play on did indeed solve this coordination problem.
[01:48:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> We had a Discord server for the raiding guilds on our WoW server, and we did indeed have a daily schedule of dragon head turn-ins, and we did indeed get promises (kept, and enforced by blacklisting) from every raid guild on the server not to fuck it up
[01:49:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> And for a year, every day, like clockwork, at exactly 7:50 EST, someone would turn in a dragon head - no one else having done it for the preceding six hours - and the buff would be triggered, and then everyone would go raid.
[01:49:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> This was totally community-organized
[01:49:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> No involved from Blizzard at all; nothing imposed, nothing provided by any external authority
[01:49:59] <superz> Ok cool.

[01:50:07] <saturn2> traditional air-conditioners *are* heat pumps :(
[01:50:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> People who came to our server from other ones routinely expressed amazement that we had this arrangement going
[01:50:57] <gwern> saturn2: you can't run them as heat pumps, though, that's the problem
[01:51:28] <gwern> (the versions that can be run both ways cost extra)
[01:51:34] <saturn2> oh, i see
[01:51:48] <saturn2> they are still heat pumps though
[01:52:05] <saturn2> they just only heat the outdoors
[01:53:00] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: why 7:50 and not 8:00
[01:53:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't remember the reasoning, honestly
[01:54:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most raids start at 9:00 so maybe someone figured "give people an hour for other prep, and then 10 minutes' padding" - who knows
[01:54:56] <saturn2> interesting story, in any case

[04:11:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Take meat (beef, chicken, whatever; any cut you have; big chunks or strips or really anything that will fit in the pan); season it how you like; throw the meat in the pan right on top of the onions. Throw some cloves of garlic in there too. Other flavorful vegetables? Sure why not (crushed tomatoes, chopped bell peppers, chopped mushrooms, etc.)
[04:11:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. Cover, heat to low, 1 hr.
[04:11:34] <feep> huh. either my code is already clean, or this new covariance/contravariance check is not working.
[04:11:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> 4. Chop up some root vegetables and throw 'em in there on top of the meat, cover it back up.
[04:11:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> 5. Let it keep cooking until veggies are soft.
[04:11:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> 6. Done
[04:12:01] <feep> that sounds delicious
[04:14:13] <gwern> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRm1FDIfYTQ this is a good example of a 'sync' AMV. it really only does one thing: sync clips of _Spice and Wolf_ to the melody. but it does it very thoroughly, and S&W has a lot of fun reaction/interactions to quote, so it works

[04:17:40] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: so the only liquid is the quarter cup of oil? it may be tasty but it doesn't sound like a stew
[04:18:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Juice from the onions and meat
[04:18:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: It ends up being a *lot* of liquid, you'd be surprised
[04:18:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the secret of this recipe, in fact
[04:18:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It sounds like it'll just be dry but it's absolutely not
[04:18:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> You stew it covered so the steam is captured
[04:19:00] <saturn2> huh
[04:19:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> I used thin-cut beef and dry-aged in the fridge for 3 days and it was still a ton of liquid

[04:24:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: The thing is that normally, you saute onions first, right? In stew recipes... you cook all the liquid out of them, to brown / caramelize them. But you don't do that here, you dump the meat right on the onions minutes after you've added them to the pan. So all the water in the onion stays in the pan. And onions are largely water...
[04:24:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if you add tomatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, then it's even more of the same effect

[05:48:49] <TheWhisper> but the internet says the "optimal viewing distance" for a 24-inch monitor is 3.2 feet.
[05:48:55] <TheWhisper> If I go 3.2 feet from my display, I can barely read the text
[05:49:01] <TheWhisper> (not barely, but it's blurry)
[05:49:09] <feep> TheWhisper: that's arm's length, right?
[05:49:18] <TheWhisper> It's longer than my arm
[05:49:22] <feep> do you have a 4k display? is your dip setup right?

[05:49:28] <TheWhisper> 0.97 meters

Another thing to consider is that fetishes stack.  People can have >= 2 fetishes and favorite characters on top of it and may prefer images that combine everything they like.

Assuming each fetish and one's favorite characters are independent, only (X^F)*(Y^C) images will hit the spot for them (where X in [0, 1] is how common a random fetish is, Y is how common a random character is (especially unrealistic; it's mostly the 2hus and Miku), F is the number of fetishes one has, and C is the number of characters one is into).  Moreover, they may have fetishes they strongly dislike D,

[16:03:34] <feep> super works!
[16:03:37] <Gurkenglas> Suppose AGI takes another 30 years. Would genetic engineering for IQ better or worsen our chances? By default smarter people (and smarter perhaps in new ways!) are good, but there's also that more diverse personalities in smart people make us more vulnerable to the unilateralist's curse
[16:05:02] <feep> depends on how random breakthrough driven you expect AGI vs safety research to be
[16:05:18] <feep> I'd argue safety research is less random breakthrough driven, so IQ helps
[16:06:07] <feep> I think this applies even if IQ boost shortens the timeline
[16:06:48] <feep> heck, if IQ *makes* people concerned about AI safety, you could get asymmetric benefit depending on just how iqstarved safety is vs fundamentals

[16:07:09] <feep> ie. if nonsafe agi research is organizationally limited, which seems plausible
[16:07:30] <feep> iq doesn't boost google's ability to run large teams
[16:07:47] <feep> so in sum I think it'd be a good thing
[16:08:05] <Gurkenglas> i would expect the sorts of differently smart people we can get from genetic engineering to produce a lot more random breakthroughs
[16:08:25] <rsaarelm> Genetic engineering for IQ is going to take a long time to start showing results even if we decided to go all out for it starting today.
[16:08:39] <Gurkenglas> yeah, which is why i postulated it taking another 30 years.
[16:08:40] <feep> yeah at a 30 year timeline it almost certainly doesn't matter
[16:08:49] <feep> Gurkenglas: no like, even at a 30 year timeline
[16:08:52] <rsaarelm> Yeah.
[16:08:58] <feep> that gives you like ... one optimized generation
[16:09:08] <rsaarelm> We'd maybe see some little bit of effect right near the end if we're lucky, probably not.
[16:09:23] <Gurkenglas> yeah, I'm aiming for effect in about 25 years.
[16:09:35] <feep> this is almost certainly swamped by outreach
[16:10:00] <feep> you can't raise kids "to be AI safety researchers" anyways
[16:10:11] <Gurkenglas> fair enough. to get more diverse than that you'd have to deliberately introduce mutations that wouldn't occur in nature
[16:10:26] <rsaarelm> I guess the "perfectly average human genome" moonshot project is one we could get started on right now, I think the cost for fully synthesized human genome was estimated at round $1 billion, so if you're playing with moonshot money, doable.
[16:10:51] <Gurkenglas> eh im pretty sure you can raise kids to spend a little time on lots of fields, and it shouldnt take a lot of time for the right sort of mind to come up with the right ideas
[16:11:15] <rsaarelm> And that'd let you test Hsu's hypothesis that random mutations are keeping people dumb and just going with non-mutant gene for everything would get you a super-smart and super-healthy person.
[16:11:46] <Gurkenglas> (although maybe i would have to update away from how ideas work if AGI surprises me by taking another 30 years)
[16:13:07] <rsaarelm> My quick hunch is that you'd want to talk around 100 years for the timespan where you start seeing significant effects from IQ-raising genetic engineering. Though I guess the first adult generation from when the technique is actually working would have a big impact.

People who talk about it are usually no-fappers, who may just be more vulnerable to it.)  But why wouldn't more stable fetishes that manifest early and persist for life stack?  If one imprinted on feet (or however you acquire a foot fetish) and bondage, I'll expect that person to seek and prefer porn with both.  Do you think that 
[18:26:51] <dbohdan> people typically have one fetish that dominates all others?
[18:27:24] <gwern> that seems to be the case. just base rates would imply that

[23:00:07] <Logos01> SOME income disparity is optimal. But it works out best when it's decentralized, rather than hyper-concentrated.
[23:00:21] <kuudes> top income does not matter. median income and low income matter
[23:00:25] <dbohdan> gwern: I see.  "Rigid and unadaptable" seems to echo the footnote in https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/01/19/no-dynamic-type-systems-are-not-inherently-more-open/#2020-01-19-no-dynamic-type-systems-are-not-inherently-more-open-footnote-2-return that the lack of structural typing for "open-world" domain modeling is Haskell's biggest flaw.

[23:01:50] <dbohdan> When I tried to use Haskell, it was the strings and the compile times that put me off the most.  Laziness seemed kind of cool, because it obviated the need for macros.

[23:17:37] <dbohdan> shawwwn: I think macros are overhyped, and their tradeoffs are insufficiently acknowledged.  Macros introduce a distinction between compile time and runtime that in a language with no static typing or emphasis on producing binary artifacts feels arbitrary and unnecessary.  It forces you to structure your metaprogramming around it.  A rigorous take on fexprs, like in <https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html>, would be better.  I even prefer the 
[23:17:37] <dbohdan> simple, closure-less code quoting of Tcl.

[23:19:10] <dbohdan> In Tcl a control structure is just a procedure that takes quoted code as an argument

[23:24:25] <dbohdan> (I think Tcl is a wonder of high-concept language design, but it isn't really made for large programs.  It gives you all the string in the world to hang yourself with.)

[23:40:35] <gwern> 'He took such care of his body that he rarely drank heavily or smoked marijuana, announcing himself an expert in other vices, claiming that he possessed the largest private collection of pornography in the world. When one skeptic questioned how this could be proved, the man recalled, Mr. Rogan delivered a two-word affirmation that sounded convincing enough: “Trust me.” (A Rogan spokesman...
[23:40:41] <gwern> ...said, “If there was ever a comment like this made, it was in the context of a joke.”)'
[23:41:33] <gwern> 'Friends tend to cite twin personal developments that seemed to leaven the experience of being around Joe Rogan: He has been with his now-wife, Jessica — with whom he has three children — for some two decades, after long speaking openly about the uselessness of marriage. (“Everybody who knows me says there’s, like, me pre-children and post-children,” Mr. Rogan told his friend Dave...
[23:41:39] <gwern> ...Chappelle on the podcast in May. “I’m so much nicer.”) And he determined that marijuana was a fine choice after all. “I’ve never seen pot help somebody like it helped him,” Mr. Irrera, the comic, said. “We would just be like, ‘Oh, God, I hope he has his edibles today,’” Mr. Kunitz recalled. “That would mellow him out.”' huh

[23:55:11] <gwern> surprised to see a journal do that
[23:55:23] <shawwwn> dbohdan: basically, most people like or dislike language features because they like or dislike them. I like macros because I get more done with them than without
[23:55:55] <shawwwn> It’s impossible for me not to prefer macros, because it ends up accomplishing more of my goals in a shorter unit of time
[23:56:22] <shawwwn> So the question isn’t “why am I wrong?” — it’s just difference of objectives

[23:57:17] <shawwwn> There’s nothing wrong with thinking that macros suck and fexprs are better. But I do invite you to try getting real work done — if fexprs are more productive for you, I would definitely be interested to understand why.
[23:57:38] <shawwwn> Because it means I’m missing out on something that could let me accomplish more goals faster, which is the only thing I care about
