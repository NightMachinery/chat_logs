[00:00:46] <kuudes> the first restaurant ban came from restauranter association pleading the government to ban them so that they would get insurance money rather than holding empty halls

[00:08:10] <dbohdan[phone]> kuudes: I am kind of impressed with the coordination: there wasn't enough people defecting to make keeping the restaurants open more profitable than claiming insurance money
[00:08:56] <kuudes> well, people feared for a lethal disease *shrugs*
[00:09:35] <kuudes> like, at least where I was, it was people who withdrew their kids to home, the officials sort of post-fact decided to remote the schools
[00:10:18] <adiabatic> gwern: where I live, uphill is north. when that doesn't hold anymore, I struggle
[00:10:42] <kuudes> there was one class that got quarantined in my child's school, so the headmaster reported to us that 60% kids were present the next monday, and on thursday the same week iirc something like 20% of kids were present. the decision to remote the schools came friday
[00:11:03] <kuudes> 3/4 of adult population went self remote work
[00:11:15] <dbohdan[phone]> kuudes: Over here people did not and had to be forced, ineffectively, every step of the way. It's a low-trust society.
[00:11:45] <kuudes> so basicly as our society enables us to self isolate, when there was news that in italy people are dying en masse, people figured to save themselves and quit the society if they could. and many could
[00:12:08] <kuudes> ie "let the stupid or poor people die, I can remain at home" etc
[00:12:55] <kuudes> everyone has internet at home, and most people work in postindustrial services of some sort, so remote working was not actually that hard as long no boss complained

While in the past many stores were able to sell pseudoephedrine, new laws in the United States have restricted sales to
[00:53:21] <feepbot> pharmacies, with the medicine kept behind the counter. The pharmacies require signatures and examination of government issued ID in order to purchase pseudoephedrine.

A quick search of

[02:44:14] <gwern> so, they took 495 G. I suppose that's better than taking all of it
[02:44:20] <kuudes> the boats and sports teams can be given back still
[02:44:21] <gwern> but taking it is
[02:44:33] <kuudes> no, taken is the 5G
[02:44:37] <kuudes> ie the profit
[02:44:54] <kuudes> the capital still exists in frozen accounts, the boats still exist in their storages etc
[02:45:07] <kuudes> the houses still stand and there are no refugees living in them etc
[02:45:17] <gwern> the boats are literally rotting and falling apart, as are the houses, and using up their useful life as they depreciate
[02:45:42] <kuudes> yes, but still just weeks
[02:45:53] <gwern> assuming they do not incur any seizures because their berths or mortgages can't be paid, among countless other second-order effects that it is crocodile laughter to deny exists despite it being quite intentional
[02:46:23] <kuudes> ok. we could spend the 500 G$ but I presume putin would be even unhappier
[02:46:33] <kuudes> if he wouldn't, I guess there was no reason to not to do so yet
[02:46:38] <kuudes> money is fungible after all
[02:46:57] <gwern> "chelsea went bankrupt because it lacked revenue to pay its debts and rents and now you own nothing inside that 'safe'? oh gosh, that's just too bad. we didn't *take* your stuff, we just *froze* it. totally different!"
[02:46:58] <kuudes> some have even proposed putin could nuke the world if we spent his 500 G$
[02:47:21] <kuudes> and not spending it we somehow would keep him from nuking the world
[02:47:43] <kuudes> but I guess they were wrong?
[02:47:52] <kuudes> and we should spend it now we know there was no difference
[02:49:35] <kuudes> was it lavrov who suggested spending that capital could amount to threat to existence of russian federation and possibly justifying an all out nuclear attack on usa, uk and others?
[02:49:54] <kuudes> and peskov who said today that russia never had entertained to use any nukes over this quibble of ukraine

[02:55:16] <kuudes> this was on 2022-02-27
[02:58:10] <kuudes> putin only threatened to end the human life on earth, did not do it; that is a nice difference. I guess he reckoned there was similar difference between freezing his moneys and burning his moneys

[04:41:02] <ggreer> f1 really needs to stop with the crazy rules. you can get interesting and competitive racing with three rules: 1. the vehicle must fit within dimensions AxBxC and have a mass below X tons. 2. there are two large speed bumps at each end of the pit lane. 3. anyone can buy the winning vehicle (in operational form) for $500,000
[04:42:12] <saturn2> what's the purpose of the speed bumps?
[04:42:40] <ggreer> to stop people from making cars with really low ground clearance which is needed for certain aerodynamic setups
[04:43:14] <ggreer> the fan car would have a tough time with that because the skirt wouldn't be close enough to the ground

[04:45:01] <ggreer> adjustable suspension would be fine. you'd pay a significant penalty in weight & reliability
[04:45:41] <ggreer> do they?
[04:45:55] <ggreer> more importantly, racing used to be done by people who didn't manufacture cars
[04:46:18] <ggreer> some people would build their own race cars (or heavily modify an existing vehicle) and race for prize money
[04:46:41] <ggreer> but now the cost to build anything competitive (that satisfies the rules of f1) is so high that it's just a few big car companies

[05:53:24] <galambo__> hi. I have a theory about morality. we kind of think about morality the same way we think about say health
[05:54:37] <galambo__> if we say we want to maximise health and use an objective proxy like 'the lower your fat percentage the healthier you are'
[05:55:14] <galambo__> you get a decent correlation in most cases but you wind up with outliers like starving african children or people with eating disorders
[05:56:10] <saturn2> who's we?
[05:56:19] <galambo__> then you say ok we define health as low body fat and ability to lift the highest percentage of your weight
[05:56:46] <gwern> galambo__: I think you're reinventing 'the tails come apart as guide to life' or whatever that post was, possibly by scott
[05:57:00] <galambo__> then you wind up with people who inject steroids and hormones
[05:57:12] <galambo__> ah scott did is the new simpsons did it
[05:59:58] <galambo__> gwern, ok but then I can apply this to anything I am trying to optimise
[06:00:04] <galambo__> morality? check
[06:00:49] <galambo__> overclocking? yes! optimise volt, temp, frequency
[06:01:19] <galambo__> investing? yes! sortino/sharpe/ulcer ratio/maximum drawdown
[06:01:47] <galambo__> just get a spreadsheet. plug in all the values. use the solver macro to find the optimal solution. keep playing with the results
[06:03:36] <galambo__> find something that each algorithm agrees is 80% or 90% near its optimum
[06:08:02] <gwern> I think I've lost whatever point you were getting at
[06:09:49] <galambo__> in morality, if I make a committee of a deontologist, and utilitarian and a virtue ethicist. and then ask them and let them vote on the best course of action
[06:10:16] <galambo__> they will collectively make 'better' moral decisions than say an absolute utilitarian
[06:11:10] <galambo__> particularly in weird or extreme scenarios
[06:12:29] <galambo__> similar to health. if I define health by one parameter my model will get broken quickly. if I include lots of parameters I get closer to what we intuitively mean by health
[06:13:08] <galambo__> people say there is no such thing as morality, just because it is hard to define
[06:13:34] <galambo__> but you can make the same argument about anything that is complex

[12:27:47] <feep[work]> capisce: bout the same
[12:27:50] * PlanckWalk has a suspicion that even with hundreds of thousands of CPUs, Uber's losses aren't from hardware costs.
[12:27:51] <feep[work]> PlanckWalk: no? gc is cheaper.
[12:28:39] <feep[work]> gc just has larger blocks of cost.
[12:28:51] <feep[work]> rc is a more diffused pain
[12:29:10] <PlanckWalk> Hmm ... I thought GC incurred costs even when you're not even using the objects (just have the potential to access them)
[12:29:33] <feep[work]> yes but "potential to access them" is also known as     a reference.
[12:29:58] <PlanckWalk> What I mean is that reference counting only incurs a cost when you change the number of references.
[12:30:14] <feep[work]> in general it varies depending on usage patterns, neither is obviously faster or slower, you can tune your code for either, it depends on the affordances your runtime gives you, but on average gc is cheaper.

[12:30:33] <PlanckWalk> Okay
[12:30:54] <feep[work]> for one, a stop-the-world GC doesn't need to pay lock overhead, because it can protect itself from competing accesses
[12:31:20] <PlanckWalk> I do know that a company wrote a JVM that did a lot more refcounting because it was faster for many workloads.
[12:31:34] <feep[work]> and GC incurs the cost *while it runs*, ie. code that doesn't trigger the is is cheaper than running code with RC.
[12:31:48] <feep[work]> the GC*
[12:32:06] <feep[work]> yeah if we're getting into usage patterns we can debate it for hours probably :P
[12:32:10] <PlanckWalk> But the modern JVM probably has such a huge effort going into engineering GC cost that it may well be faster these days.
[12:32:27] <feep[work]> also caches are getting large enough that there's not *as* much of a benefit from keeping memory accesses local
[12:33:22] <feep[work]> and GCs have lots of clever tricks, like generational GC where you move long-lived data structures to a separate pool that's scanned less often
[12:33:34] <feep[work]> which reduces your "pay for references that aren't changed" cost
[12:34:08] <feep[work]> or lifetimes and linear types (rust) for RC, where you don't pay for references that are "obvious", ie. copying a value just to return it.
[12:34:31] <PlanckWalk> Oh yeah, good lifetime scoping and such helps a ton
[12:34:51] <PlanckWalk> I recall some fun discussion about escape analysis for objects
[12:34:52] <feep[work]> but ime, GC is a bit better.
[12:35:12] <feep[work]> it just has the unfortunate downside of large occasional costs.
[12:35:16] <feep[work]> (which is why neat uses rc.)
[12:35:34] <PlanckWalk> Since some large percentage of objects never escape the functions they're created in.
[12:35:43] <feep[work]> well, that's ... um
[12:35:47] <feep[work]> there are some languages that are just bad?
[12:36:00] <feep[work]> if you have a function that just creates allocations only to free them, then that is a bad function
[12:36:11] <feep[work]> and if your language forces you to do this cough java cough, that is a bad language.
[12:36:20] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I was never a fan of that.
[12:36:28] <feep[work]> like. in D as we use it at work
[12:36:35] <feep[work]> we often have functions that don't do any allocations at all
[12:36:41] <feep[work]> they just describe transformations on data
[12:36:59] <feep[work]> and then at the end of a long processing chain there's like a single finalization step where all these computations are cashed out, and *that* allocates.
[12:37:13] <feep[work]> (and then sticks it in a data structure, where it lives for a good long while.)

[12:38:44] <feep[work]> neat is a lot more alloc happy, because it pays a malloc/free overhead but little cache churn overhead.

[12:41:28] <feep[work]> exactly
[12:41:46] <feep[work]> like, example. say there's a journey, that consists of a series of visits to locations, each of which has a time of arrival and/or time of departure
[12:42:12] <feep[work]> now we may call this Visit[], but we may also want to access it as a list of Time[]s
[12:42:46] <feep[work]> so we can have a function auto times(Visit[] visits) { return visits.map!(visit => only(visit.arrival, visit.departure)).join; }
[12:43:05] <feep[work]> and when you call this, there is zero allocation. in fact, the return type is still, in effect, "Visit[]".
[12:43:31] <feep[work]> it's just "Visit[], but we did a bunch of processing on it." the actual data stored in the type is still the original array. (plus a few bytes for bookkeeping iteration.)
[12:43:52] <PlanckWalk> Neat.
[12:44:24] <nshepperd2> ghc is pretty good, it does 'unboxing' optimizations that take semantically lazy heap objects and eliminate the allocation to just put the underlying data on the stack or registers when they don't escape the function

[12:57:01] <saturn2> how fast tracing GC is depends a lot on how much memory you can afford to throw at it
[12:58:22] <feep[work]> true true
[12:58:46] <feep[work]> technically, the process cleanup code is a kind of gc
[12:59:06] <feep[work]> (with a very short mark phase :P)
[12:59:43] <feep[work]> well, actually considering cow, is it more of a rc..?
[12:59:51] <saturn2> you only pay for live objects, so if you accumulate a huge amount of garbage between GCs the amortized cost can be tiny
[13:00:37] <saturn2> this is why people used to claim it was faster than malloc and so on
[13:01:10] <feep[work]> meanwhile, the D compiler has the opposite problem, it accumulates almost no garbage
[13:01:19] <feep[work]> which is why the first thing it does is just turn its own GC off and leak everything :D

[14:58:04] <galambo_> hi
[14:58:45] <galambo_> gurkenglas, this is not a good strategy. you get a lot of volatility but you dont get compensated for your risk
[14:59:35] <gurkenglas> galambo_: that's not the point, the strategy is just an example
[15:01:02] <galambo_> gurkenglas, I know with crypto some website show the biggest gainers and losers of the day
[15:01:53] <galambo_> Im pretty sure you can do it manually with stocks
[15:02:32] <gurkenglas> galambo_: that's unrelated to what i said :(
[15:02:58] <galambo_> but it will take a lot of time each day, you will lose a lot in transaction costs, you will have lots of volatility and you will not be compensated for this volatility
[15:03:10] <galambo_> you can maybe do it manually with stocks
[15:03:24] <galambo_> or you can check /r/wsb
[15:05:32] <galambo_> wait yes I misread
[15:11:02] <galambo_> gurkenglas, there are strategies that work well in backtests but they tend to overfit the data
[15:11:48] <galambo_> for example 200 day simple moving average compares the stock with the price over the previous 200 days and uses this as a signal
[15:12:05] <galambo_> some strategies looks at volatility. invest less when markets are volatile
[15:12:43] <galambo_> others look at momentum
[15:13:40] <gurkenglas> galambo_: of course you would check whether the backtest works out better than you'd expect from selecting the best strategy from a thousand when they're all useless
[15:14:20] <gurkenglas> (and you would estimate how many people like you there are, to guard against that second source of selection bias)

[15:16:14] <gurkenglas> ok, how many bits of fitting to past data did you do to arrive at it?
[15:17:20] <galambo_> nothing. its a simple asset allocation. no algorithms involved. I played with simulations on multiple websites and they all told me it is better than s&p 500
[15:17:32] <galambo_> better sharpe. better returns. lower drawdown

[15:19:44] <galambo_> gurkenglas, ok I am being a bit coy here
[15:19:57] <galambo_> simple principles such as asset diversification is the only free luch, and trying to achieve risk parity. all rational principles

[15:21:29] <PlanckWalk> If your asset allocation strategy is different from that, then you presumably have more inputs.

[15:33:10] <galambo_> Filipepe, :)
[15:34:04] <galambo_> gurkenglas, ok I feel I am being too coy so I will just spill it out
[15:34:30] <gurkenglas> probably you only need to put one unreliable asset into the mix to make it technically outperform
[15:34:47] <gurkenglas> but practically you've poisoned the allocation with 20% that have 2% to go -100%
[15:34:51] <galambo_> my strategy is basically a mix of stocks, treasuries, gold, crypto. trying to match their allocations to their historical volatility. and then applying a small amount of leverage.
[15:35:56] <gurkenglas> small amount of leverage how?
[15:36:07] <galambo_> hfea (hedgefundie's excellent adventure) is probably the closest to mine but hfea is too undiversified and too aggressive
[15:36:34] <galambo_> gurkenglas, where do you live?
[15:37:23] <gurkenglas> galambo_: Germany
[15:38:49] <capisce> galambo_: where do you buy gold?
[15:38:59] <galambo_> capisce, a gold fund
[15:39:11] <capisce> which one?
[15:39:14] <galambo_> gurkenglas, I dont know how things work in germany.
[15:39:46] <galambo_> capisce, I live in the uk. so we use different funds in europe than the us
[15:39:46] <gurkenglas> galambo_: is this the kind of leverage where you say "1.5 leverage" on your 10k and then you commit to sell your position for -100% when 15k would hit -66%?
[15:40:22] <galambo_> gurkenglas, more like daily rebalance
[15:41:13] <gurkenglas> huh. that sounds like it amplifies all the stock movements
[15:42:22] <galambo_> I dont know what you mean by that. this actually reduces your stock exposure if the market is going down
[15:42:53] <galambo_> there is a risk of volatility decay
[15:42:55] <gurkenglas> i mean, if everyone uses leverage, then everyone will sell their position when the market goes down, and everyone will increase their position when the market goes up
[15:44:00] <galambo_> but not everyone uses leverage. and you are diversified. so you can buy the crashing asset for cheap
[15:44:54] <galambo_> so say the stock market is going up but gold is crashing. you sell expensive stocks and buy gold for cheap. then gold goes up relative to stocks. so you sell expensive gold and buy cheap stocks
[15:45:07] <galambo_> you automatically buy low sell high
[15:45:59] <capisce> galambo_: I'm in the EU, although I guess after brexit UK domiciled funds might not be ideal
[15:47:11] <gurkenglas> galambo_: then i misunderstood "daily rebalance". what i thought you meant "leverage as in, you have 10k but everyone pretends you have 15k. after one day you made +1k, rebalance: you now have 11k, so everyone pretends you have 16.5k"
[15:47:36] <gurkenglas> "this additional 500 is immediately invested in the same position, buy high sell low"
[15:48:07] <galambo_> gurkenglas, I think we are talking about 2 different things
[15:48:16] <gurkenglas> galambo_: okay. Explain how your leverage works.
[15:48:45] <galambo_> yes if you invest $100 with say 3x leverage
[15:51:05] <galambo_> ok Im trying to find a link that explains it better

[15:51:48] <Robomot> Double-Digit Numerics - Articles - The Big Myth about Leveraged ETFs (Using Advanced Mathematics to Enhance Returns)
[15:52:52] <Filipepe> my "strategy": S&P and crypto :p
[15:54:47] <galambo_> basically you are leveraged and rebalancing daily. if the stocks keeps going down and up and down and up and then eventually reaches where it originally started
[15:54:55] <gurkenglas> *reads a few paragraphs* well obviously you want an asset that's not giving you the %-return of SNP times two, but the factor-increase in SNP squared
[15:55:14] <galambo_> you may get different results if you are using a leveraged etf. because when the stock goes down you lose a lot of money compared to the unleveraged version
[15:55:46] <gurkenglas> galambo_: you're not explaining what i asked though, which is: how does your leveraging work in the first place
[15:55:54] <galambo_> and when the stock starts going back up you start at a lower initial point than the stock itself
[15:55:59] <gurkenglas> is it "there's this leveraged version of snp, i buy that instead"?
[15:56:09] <galambo_> it basically rebalances everyday
[15:56:34] <galambo_> they settle the futures everyday
[15:56:46] <galambo_> gurkenglas, yes upro
[15:57:06] <galambo_> upro is 3x, sso is 2x
[15:57:10] <gurkenglas> galambo_: then my question is. who is selling it?? if you make more money on this than on snp then surely someone else is losing that money. who?
[15:59:00] <galambo_> Im not sure how the inner workings of it are. you are basically borrowing money to buy more assets
[15:59:12] <gurkenglas> borrowing money from who?
[15:59:26] <galambo_> they use futures
[15:59:45] <gurkenglas> futures need a counterparty too
[16:01:24] <galambo_> I dont know is the honest answer
[16:01:51] <gurkenglas> i recommend that if you don't know who the sucker is, you shouldn't leverage your snp :D
[16:02:35] <galambo_> ummm I dont think it works this way
[16:03:18] <galambo_> you do something similar when you buy a mortgage from the bank or make a project
[16:03:20] <gurkenglas> you think you can buy upro without there being someone who goes ~"hmm i think i can make money by shorting upro"?
[16:03:37] <galambo_> yes you can short the s&p 500
[16:03:44] <gurkenglas> not what i said
[16:03:48] <galambo_> and you can short the etf that shorts the s&p 500
[16:04:44] <galambo_> you pay higher fees than you would have paid for an unleveraged asset

[16:04:59] <gurkenglas> what i was trying to say my-2 lines above: you think you can buy upro without someone to buy it from, who presumably thinks he's being smart?
[16:05:10] <galambo_> but its fine. if you dont want leverage you can just stick with something like the golden butterfly without leverage
[16:05:27] <galambo_> I actually dont think you can easily access leverage in germany
[16:05:55] <galambo_> you get similar gains to the s&p 500 with less drawdowns
[16:06:07] *** Quits: schmudde (~schmudde@public.toolboxoffice.it) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[16:06:09] <galambo_> if you use the golden butterfly
[16:06:19] <gurkenglas> i am going this hard on this line of inquiry because if i am reading the situation correctly my argument seems watertight
[16:08:18] <gurkenglas> my argument against golden butterfly is more abstract: suppose there wasn't any free lunch; wouldn't you still always be able to find 5 of the 10 simplest assets such that mixing those together performed well?
[16:09:22] <galambo_> gurkenglas, ok I know something I think is easier for me to understand that uses leverage: https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/ethfli
[16:09:22] <Robomot> TokenSets - Asset Management Simplified (Use Set’s battle-tested asset management tools and infrastructure to easily manage your crypto portfolios.)
[16:09:33] <galambo_> this is a 2x leveraged ethereum fund
[16:09:56] <galambo_> on defi you can lend USD and get nice returns for it
[16:10:20] <gurkenglas> is the idea is that you have to post collateral in order to get granted leverage?
[16:10:30] <galambo_> this fund basically borrows USD from defi
[16:10:43] <galambo_> and uses ethereum as collateral
[16:11:01] <galambo_> so the lenders get a nice stable income from their usd
[16:11:19] <galambo_> and the borrowers get a leveraged exposure to ethereum albeit while paying high fee
[16:11:34] <galambo_> everyone gets what they want
[16:11:42] <galambo_> yes
[16:12:12] <galambo_> and then the rebalance is daily so if ethereum loses 50% in one day I think this fund will get wiped out
[16:13:44] <gurkenglas> wait maybe i misunderstood. there are two kinds of traders here, yes? 1 "ETH go moon" dude with $ and 1 "I have 1k ETH on a harddrive for ten years now" dude. right?
[16:15:38] <gurkenglas> the harddriver gives his ETH to the mooner and the mooner gives his $ to the harddriver. the harddriver invests in snp?
[16:16:09] <galambo_> I dont know what you mean. in this scenario there is someone who just wants a stable income. so they switch all their crypto to USDC and then lend it on defi and get a stable income each year
[16:16:27] <galambo_> say 2% or 4% or whatever
[16:16:31] <galambo_> ad infinitum
[16:16:36] <gurkenglas> okay what is the lent defi used for
[16:16:52] <gurkenglas> the lent coins, i mean
[16:17:10] <galambo_> then theres someone who is very optimistic about ethereum. ethereum to the moon. fomo
[16:17:29] <galambo_> so the person optimistic about ethereum borrows money from the person lending usdc
[16:18:18] <galambo_> to buy even more ethereum than they would have normally bought
[16:19:15] <galambo_> if you scroll down the page you will find the underlying tokens are compound ethereum and a negative position on usdc
[16:20:08] <gurkenglas> so if eth goes down 50% in a day then the fomo goes bankrupt and the borrowed USDC goes back to the lender?
[16:20:15] <galambo_> yes
[16:20:47] <galambo_> actually this particular ethereum etf doesnt use daily reset. it is just continuous. very weird stuff that I dont get. please dont leverage ethereum. its just an example
[16:21:12] <gurkenglas> continuous sounds better, actually.
[16:21:21] <galambo_> yes
[16:21:22] <gurkenglas> i was planning to bring up that that should be the actual implementation
[16:22:30] <galambo_> about the golden butterfly. the golden butterfly is not the most optimal asset allocation imo. but its just an example to point out that owning lots of different assets and rebalancing between them is better than you expect
[16:22:48] <galambo_> you get better risk adjusted returns
[16:23:12] <galambo_> so if you dont use leverage you get similar returns to the s&p 500 but with much lower risk of losing your money
[16:23:18] <gurkenglas> rebalancing. if one of those 5 stocks crashes completely, don't you rebalance the entire butterfly into it?
[16:23:40] <gurkenglas> -stocks+component assets
[16:23:41] <galambo_> no you just buy as much of it so it becomes 20% of your portfolio
[16:24:18] <galambo_> say gold crashes and it is now 10% of your portfolio instead of 20%
[16:24:21] <gurkenglas> yeah the complete crash is "every day wall street snickers and shorts the crashed asset down further against the fool who put another 20% into it"
[16:24:43] <galambo_> gurkenglas, yes but you are not allocating 20% of your assets into $gme
[16:25:00] <gurkenglas> someone figures out a way to turn lead into gold. he sells everyone all the gold. you allocate another 20%. he sells even more. repeat a few times
[16:25:32] <galambo_> gurkenglas, yes so they suggest quarterly rebalancing
[16:25:36] <galambo_> so every 3 months
[16:25:46] <galambo_> gives it time to stabilise in price
[16:26:00] <gurkenglas> this incurs additional bits, you realize
[16:26:36] <galambo_> and we will have to go back to the efficient market hypothesis
[16:26:45] <galambo_> you cannot outsmart the market

[16:28:21] <galambo_> gurkenglas, yes it is better than monthly or rebalancing every 6 months. at least with leveraged etfs. I dont know about golden butterfly
[16:28:36] <gurkenglas> if we can go to the category theorist introduce him to butterflies and he says "you forgot to rebalance slowly" then it doesnt count as extra bits :)
[16:29:24] <galambo_> sure it is more complex than an s&p 500. but you can simplify it if you want
[16:29:49] <gurkenglas> galambo_: what if I have loads of gold but people don't know how I made it so I can divide the price by 2 repeatedly?
[16:30:04] <galambo_> what do you mean?
[16:31:13] <gurkenglas> i have the philosophers stone, i can make gold for free, nobody knows this. i go to the market and flood it with gold, halving the price. i let the price stabilize. it won't be 0 because it's a plausible hypothesis that i can't do this for free
[16:32:19] <galambo_> why are you asking this? I am trying to clarify how relevant this is to what we are talking about
[16:32:27] <gurkenglas> every time i divide the price by two, that's additional evidence that i can do it for *free*, but the probability that it costs me something also only goes down at exponential speed

[16:36:30] <galambo_> I think Harry Markowitz won the nobel prize in economics for this discovery
[16:37:33] <gurkenglas> yes and via that i found his "foundations of portfolio theory" but nowhere in there does it say "theorem" or "proof" or "free lunch"
[16:37:55] <gurkenglas> (his nobel lecture)
[16:39:17] <galambo_> I think it is intuitive no? like in the s&p 500 you are investing in 500 companies. if a company fails its value can only go to 0. but if a company soars it can make 100% or 1000% or 100000% profits
[16:39:21] <feep[work]> gurkenglas: I think efficiency only requires that the total possible exploitation is bounded
[16:39:27] <feep[work]> not that it's necessarily limited in time

[16:40:37] <feep[work]> also the market would never go to zero, it would go to the purchase value, ie. the level that people actually value having gold at.
[16:40:45] <galambo_> like lets say you own an ice cream factory. and now you want to make another company.
[16:41:31] <gurkenglas> galambo_: i don't think that's the reason you want diversification. it's more like, your utility diminishes in money, so you don't want to go all in on a 60% chance to double your money, but you do want to place some of your money there. so you invest in a hundred companies in parallel so they don't all crash at once
[16:41:42] <galambo_> you might want to buy a hot beverage factory. this way if the weather is cold and the ice cream factory loses money you compensate this by making more money with the hot beverage company
[16:41:47] <gurkenglas> s/so they don't/hoping that they don't
[16:42:00] <feep[work]> this is the same reason
[16:42:09] <galambo_> then you sell shares from the hot beverage company and buy more shares in the ice cream company
[16:42:15] <feep[work]> ie. ice cream and hot beverage are anticorrelated
[16:42:21] <galambo_> in a similar way stocks and treasuries are anticorrelated
[16:42:37] <galambo_> if the stock market crashes you make a lot of money in treasuries
[16:42:44] <gurkenglas> feep[work]: yeah i was referring to the reason above that said that loss is bounded but wins can go moon
[16:42:57] <feep[work]> are they anticorrelated tho
[16:43:10] <galambo_> because treasuries are a flight to safety
[16:43:15] <feep[work]> if the stock market crashes this directly threatens the ability of the state to pay its debts
[16:43:28] <galambo_> feep[work], historically yes
[16:43:33] <feep[work]> huh
[16:43:43] <galambo_> US treasuries ijn particular
[16:43:47] <feep[work]> seems like it should cause someone to make a company that buys treasuries
[16:43:54] <gurkenglas> i agree that investing in anticorrelation is wise, above and beyond investing in no-correlation
[16:43:56] <feep[work]> and get listed on the s&p
[16:44:13] <galambo_> when the world panics they buy US treasuries. this happened in the 2008 and 2020 crashes
[16:44:37] <galambo_> and backtests show they are anticorrelated
[16:44:54] <galambo_> (but not always. they both went down in the q1 2022)
[16:45:20] <galambo_> gold is not correlated to neither stocks nor treasuries so its a nice diversifier

[16:45:41] <galambo_> even though gold is just a shiny useless thing that brings no profit or income in the long run
[16:45:46] <feep[work]> is there a "stocks plus treasuries plus precious resources meta-etf"?
[16:45:57] <gurkenglas> that sounds like 3 bits of evidence and 1 of them contradicts your theory? (not being very serious)
[16:46:15] <galambo_> gurkenglas, how so?
[16:46:19] <gurkenglas> feep[work]: golden butterfly, it's what he's currently trying to sell us on :)
[16:46:37] <feep[work]> fair nuf
[16:46:45] <galambo_> feep[work], there is one by wisdomtree thats 90% stocks and 60% treasuries.
[16:46:51] <feep[work]> that seems broken
[16:47:00] <feep[work]> shouldn't it be stocks and treasuries depending on value?
[16:47:12] <galambo_> feep[work], what do you mean?
[16:47:22] <feep[work]> ie. if treasuries go up and stocks go down it should have to sell stocks and buy treasuries
[16:47:25] <feep[work]> and vice versa
[16:47:32] <gurkenglas> galambo_: 2008,2020,2022 <- three datapoints, each about one bit. (perhaps more than one bit because the competing hypothesis plausibly predicted >90% on movement in tandem)
[16:47:45] <galambo_> feep[work], you need a fixed allocation and rebalance to maintain that allocation
[16:47:46] <feep[work]> ie. model the stocks + treasures + precious resources index.

[16:48:29] <galambo_> feep[work], ummm
[16:49:03] <feep[work]> it's a bit awkward cause resources work differently than stocks
[16:49:27] <gurkenglas> how so
[16:49:32] <galambo_> gurkenglas, 2022 is not a crash. Im just giving an example that they can have a positive correlation. but historically they were anticorrelated
[16:49:38] <gurkenglas> ah ok.
[16:49:38] <feep[work]> does gold have a market cap?
[16:49:54] <gurkenglas> feep[work]: are market caps meaningful?
[16:50:04] <feep[work]> it's the s&p 500 basis
[16:50:12] <gurkenglas> huh
[16:50:22] <gurkenglas> i dont see why anyone cares about "amounts of stock that exist" * "current price"
[16:50:54] <gurkenglas> if someone owns the entire company and sells his stock then the price will go down so he cant realize the market cap
[16:50:56] <feep[work]> well if you care about current price only, then if you dilute the stock it gets kicked lower in the index
[16:51:30] <galambo_> I prefer volatility over market cap
[16:51:33] <feep[work]> which seems silly
[16:51:43] <galambo_> sure
[16:52:31] <galambo_> volatility and anticorrelation. but yes you are correct. if we take 'diversification is the only free lunch' to its logical conclusion 
[16:52:55] <galambo_> we should just buy a global stock tracker, and a global bond tracker

[16:54:09] <gurkenglas> oh i see: snp cares less about "market cap" than about ~"how much does it cost to buy precisely 0.001% of outstanding stock" which is just a constant multiple of that
[16:54:18] <gurkenglas> but the latter makes sense to consider
[16:55:26] <gurkenglas> so feep[work], 1 ton of gold can be thought about in the same way as 1 percent of a company, regardless of how many shares that is
[16:56:46] <feep[work]> so it should work to have an index for it
[16:57:26] <galambo_> gurkenglas, in any case. I think your original question was more or less 'I want to investigate strategies that might potentially beat the s&p 500'. my answer is 'the only strategy that can beat the s&p 500 is to buy the s&p 500 AND also buy different assets. this way you get similar returns for a lower risk. if you want higher returns than the s&p 500 then you can leverage a modest amount'
[16:57:54] <galambo_> yes there are assets for gold and leveraged gold
[16:57:56] <galambo_> and short gold
[16:58:03] <kuudes> gurkenglas, I read the long discussion, and it comes to my mind, that you did not ask in the original question the thing you then went to discuss on
[16:58:38] <gurkenglas> kuudes: yes i kept being like "i now have additional questions"
[16:58:40] <kuudes> which means even if someone had an answer to your original question which would have answered you completely, you would not have got what you wanted
[16:59:01] <gurkenglas> i've had fun in the conversation so far!
[16:59:04] <kuudes> for my mental health, I would appreciate if you tried to formulate your questions better
[16:59:20] <kuudes> yes, so you were not asking to get answers
[16:59:27] <kuudes> but asking to get fun conversation out
[16:59:50] <gurkenglas> i would have prefered to get answers but the conversation as it turned out was also not bad
[16:59:52] <kuudes> this is in the general area of "trolling"
[16:59:57] <PlanckWalk> Uh, no.
[16:59:57] <feep[work]> no it's not
[17:00:05] <PlanckWalk> This is definitely not in the area of trolling.
[17:00:21] <kuudes> trolling specifically is action to cause fun and interesting conversations
[17:00:25] <feep[work]> definitely not
[17:00:29] <PlanckWalk> It is very much not
[17:01:07] <feep[work]> trolling is action to annoy people into wasting their time on conversations that cost them a lot of energy but that they feel morally compelled to participate in, despite having no interest in the response
[17:01:10] <galambo_> kuudes, he wasnt trolling come on
[17:01:27] <feep[work]> like asking "so which is really better, vim or emacs" on a linux mailing list
[17:01:35] <feep[work]> you don't give a fuck which editor to use
[17:01:46] <feep[work]> you just want neckbeards to write long rants so you can laugh at them wasting their time

[17:23:15] <gurkenglas> Could we do a kickstarter to short Tether into the ground?
[17:27:14] <galambo_> you can short tether and long another crypto like ethereum like that leveraged ethereum fund. but doing it manually is a lot of work
[17:27:46] <otoburb> It would seem that carrying that specific Tether trade (shorting) would be expensive
[17:35:42] <gurkenglas> hmm i guess they might technically randomly hold or not hold the money, to make it *risky* to check
[17:38:39] <gurkenglas> checking requires that you risk... 82 billion dollars, huh?
[17:45:35] <gurkenglas> or maybe they bought insurance about it :) they give 20 billion to, say, Warren Buffet, he gives them 82 billion if (as he predicts to have <10% probability) someone ever comes up with the 82 billion to check
[17:47:45] <gurkenglas> or a combination: he gives them a gurantee that if anyone ever shorts Tether, he'll probabilistically keep it stable to exactly such an extent that it wasn't worth to check it

[22:06:41] <pompolic> fair point actually
[22:07:12] <kuudes> the sanctions were because putin threatened to nuke nato.
[22:07:20] <feep> also you know, we literally wrote non-expansionism and commitment to the eu into our constitution.
[22:07:31] <kuudes> there is currently a process of de-escalation ongoing

[22:07:46] <pompolic> i'm just mad that energy prices are gonna rise over here

[22:13:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: In fact Germany is a great case study for why *not* to do that sort of thing
[22:13:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct logic here is "we should remove / split / etc. Russia!" "no, we did that to Germany and it was terrible, so no we're not going to repeat that mistake, thank you very much"
[22:13:59] <feep> yes, I tend to agree
[22:14:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Same thing with the whole "try Putin & co. as war criminals!" thing - no, don't do that, it's bad
[22:14:31] <kuudes> why?
[22:14:33] <feep> well there's no point, what would that do
[22:14:49] <feep> it'd just diminish the hague even more
[22:14:50] <kuudes> trial presupposes they have been pushed off from power
[22:14:56] <feep> right exactly
[22:15:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Ironically, I was finally convinced of this after watching the movie _Judgment at Nuremberg_. It's, obviously, a dramatized account of the Nuremberg trials, specifically the trials of some Nazi ... judges? Yeah)
[22:15:55] <feep> if putin is out of power, and for some weird reason we don't care about like, precedent for allowing dictators to step down, which we *definitely should* -- just do like, something ironic, polonium in his tea, pushed out a window, w/e
[22:16:24] <feep> the point is at that point you can do whatever you want and everyone knows it, you don't need the smokescreen of a court
[22:16:32] <kuudes> I mean, people detained in hague have it better than gaddafi?
[22:16:34] <feep> and of course if he's in power it's just a way to signal "putin bad"
[22:16:50] <kuudes> so imo there is an incentive to turn oneself to hague rather than be hanged and quartered by a mob
[22:17:06] <feep> if you can escape from a mob, you can escape to brazil or whatever
[22:17:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good movie, Spencer Tracy's in it, Marlene Dietrich... it was made from the totally standard Western viewpoint of "these trials were a righteous thing where evil war criminals were brought to justice"

[22:18:28] <feep> the weird cases you construct at court don't add anything, they just diminish the idea of justice.
[22:18:54] <feep> it signals is "justice is written by the victors"

[22:19:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> You are the victors, you beat your enemy, you want to kill them, yes you have the power to do that, so if you want to do that nobody's gonna stop you
[22:19:46] <feep> the mossad gets this
[22:19:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But this "trial" nonsense is a mockery of justice
[22:20:12] <feep> I think, from my impression at least
[22:20:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, I agree
[22:20:33] <kuudes> dbohdan[phone], indeed
[22:20:40] <kuudes> so, we should free https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_indicted_in_the_International_Criminal_Court ?

[22:20:45] <feep> but like, all I can think of is saddam being hanged in a dinky unlit building
[22:21:02] <feep> like, sure, whatever, spare us the courtroom anti-drama.
[22:21:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[22:21:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> The trial sends the message "justice is whatever we decide it is and has nothing to do with rule of law"

[22:22:02] <feep> yeah.
[22:22:19] <feep> kuudes: no, weren't you listening?
[22:22:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Especially in cases (like WW2!) where the winning side did lots of shit at least as bad as the things they're condemning people for!
[22:22:28] <feep> if you want them to be imprisoned, imprison them.
[22:22:46] <kuudes> ?
[22:22:57] <feep> say "these guys are evidently assholes, we want them to be stuck in a hole until they die, we're gonna do that now."
[22:23:01] <kuudes> so there just should not be any courts anytime?
[22:23:12] <feep> there is no point in having a court if the sentence is already written.
[22:23:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, in the movie, right, these guys they're trying aren't Himmler or Bormann or someone, they're some judges who did stuff like, signed court orders to sterilize people (in accordance with the law at the time!)
[22:23:33] <kuudes> feep, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljube_Bo%C5%A1koski was acquitted though?
[22:23:34] <Robomot> Ljube Boškoski - Wikipedia (Ljube Boškoski (Macedonian: Љубе Бошкоски, Macedonian pronunciation: [ˈʎubɛ 'bɔʃkɔski]) (born 24 October 1960 in Čelopek, Brvenica Municipality, SR Macedonia, now North Macedonia), known among his supporters as "Brother Ljube" (Macedonian: Брат Љубе, romanized: Brat Ljube), is a Macedonian politician and former Minister of Internal Affairs of North Macedonia.)
[22:23:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And so the defense is like: is this bad? Yes. But didn't you guys (Americans) do the same shit?? Like a decade ago??
[22:23:59] <feep> huh. okay, fair enough
[22:24:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then the counterargument is

[22:24:19] <kuudes> some have got free on complaint
[22:24:31] <feep> hm. I guess it works as a sort of court then
[22:24:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... nothing, they actually just spout some *obvious bullshit* about how "it's uh different and uh doesn't count because. reasons. GUILTY"
[22:24:48] <kuudes> so should they all have been imprisoned or released? I mean if there should be no court
[22:24:53] <kuudes> feep, yes
[22:25:01] <kuudes> we actually have international law since ww ii
[22:25:08] <kuudes> in nuremberg we didn't
[22:25:10] <feep> well, for sufficiently small countries anyway
[22:25:11] <kuudes> and yes, that was bad
[22:25:19] <kuudes> nuclear sovereignty
[22:25:19] <feep> the us being famously exempt.
[22:25:26] <kuudes> kennedy got shot
[22:25:32] <kuudes> hrutsov got fired
[22:25:51] <kuudes> it seemd going to defcon 2 may cause such
[22:26:17] <kuudes> from that presupposition I expect putin will not be in power in 2026
[22:26:24] <feep> I guess it can function as a court if no great pressure is exerted on it.
[22:26:56] <feep> I mean, it is amusing to me that the allies set this thing up and then basically immediately exempted themselves
[22:27:17] <feep> but it's not ... like, any weirder than invading somewhere and setting up a country, just at a larger scale
[22:27:20] <kuudes> if there is a national functioning court then people under such won't go to hague but instead get their local court to judge them
[22:27:26] <feep> I just wish it hadn't started with the nazis
[22:27:39] <kuudes> well, it would have started with some similarly evil people
[22:27:47] <feep> it could have been created after them
[22:27:57] <kuudes> well, yes, it sort of was
[22:27:58] <feep> but it should not have been used to try them, because then ... like
[22:28:14] <kuudes> uk/usa system presumes there is common law
[22:28:22] <kuudes> which means anyone can be judged of anything
[22:28:38] <kuudes> because there does not need to be a written law, but "a reasonable person" would deem the act as evil
[22:29:02] <feep> yeah but it's ... like. trying xi yinping in absentia, or, well, putin
[22:29:03] <kuudes> so there you don't need a thing to have been designated as a crime at the time of act
[22:29:15] <feep> this is purely dependent on your ability to first crush them militarily or economically
[22:29:28] <kuudes> or the country throwing them out
[22:29:29] <kuudes> yes
[22:29:37] <kuudes> international system is not perfect
[22:29:37] <feep> at which point like... why ??
[22:29:42] <kuudes> it is merely the best we have got
[22:29:43] <feep> no you're missing the point
[22:29:58] <feep> the point of a law is deterrence, there's an assembly of force projection that combines with it
[22:30:09] <kuudes> that is not the only point of the law
[22:30:11] <pompolic> something must be done -> this is something -> it must be done
[22:30:16] <feep> "we will arrest you, scaling up to defeat all hindrances on the way, and then we will judge you"
[22:30:29] <kuudes> we don't do that even for normal criminals
[22:30:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The whole thing was a demonstration of "the law is what we say it is, retroactively, and in fact you will all henceforth do what we say, or else we will bomb your ass, and then, in contravention of all previously existing principles of national sovereignty, will subject you to *criminal law*, as if our laws cross international borders and apply to everyone in the world, which they do, because guess what, motherfuckers,
[22:30:29] <Obormot\Arcturus>  sovereignty is dead and the entire world is America now"
[22:30:44] <kuudes> police stop investigating many crimes because they are too hard to investigate
[22:31:03] <feep> except with the icc it's "the usa or somebody else that's way above your weight class, will bomb you, then I guess lob you at this place once it doesn't matter"
[22:31:21] <feep> nobody is deterred by this! the court doesn't act as deterrence
[22:31:22] <dbohdan[phone]> Obormot\Arcturus: World-police signaling
[22:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: "Why? Because we say so. The new world govermnent is composed of: 1. America; 2. There is no step 2"
[22:31:26] <feep> the *bombs* are the deterrence.
[22:31:29] <kuudes> well, there is still the class of countries outside interest of superpowers
[22:31:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan[phone]: yep
[22:31:39] <feep> the court is just a weird appendix that the us has seen fit to glue to the end.
[22:31:51] <kuudes> ie senegal invasion of gambia was legal because au requested that and un allowed it
[22:32:16] <feep> well, it was uncontested
[22:32:34] <feep> it was legal in the force projection range of the un, which is whatever the big boys decide
[22:32:46] <kuudes> it was just that none of the big boys opposed it
[22:32:56] <kuudes> and the small countries plus officials deemed it just
[22:32:57] <feep> the point is that the entire un is just a weird ball dangling off the end of the actual levers of power.
[22:33:08] <feep> like one of those fluff things on samurai swords.
[22:33:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a reason that U.N. headquarters are in NYC, and it ain't our scenic skyline and world-class restaurants
[22:33:57] <kuudes> yes, but there is also geneve
[22:34:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol come on
[22:34:29] <kuudes> no one contests that currently indeed only nuclear sovereigns are nuclear sovereigns
[22:34:39] <kuudes> but things may change over time
[22:34:53] <kuudes> peace is slow but seems to happen
[22:35:19] <kuudes> usa and eu have sued each other in international courts and also abided by the rulings of the courts
[22:35:24] <kuudes> not on war, but still

[22:36:37] <kuudes> yes, it is preferrable to align with usa/uk/france rather than with russia or with china, mostly
[22:36:56] <kuudes> even kazakhstan now started to align with usa more than with russia
[22:38:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> (My RG28 shipped! woo!)
[22:38:38] <feep> yay
[22:39:14] <dbohdan[phone]> It better work
[22:40:51] <kuudes> hmm. I wonder how much uk's and france's nukes function is to keep usa sort of checked? O_o
[22:42:04] <kuudes> ie usa might be less able to nuclear blackmail its own allies because there are other nuclear sovereigns - more minor, but nuclear sovereigns nevertheless - among those allies
[22:42:56] <kuudes> which could be beneficial to usa as well, because the situation is more well rounded; allies are more in it not just because they fear the primant but also because it is beneficial to be within the alliance

[22:55:10] <kuudes> thanks
[22:56:11] <kuudes> feep, btw, I presume that if putin gets overthrown, then they will sentence him in russia
[22:56:28] <kuudes> russia already has war of aggression as a crime, was it 15 years

[23:19:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> The best outcome for the Western powers is that Putin keeps on keepin' on, and we can keep using this as an excuse to sanction, to (help Ukraine to) bleed Russia's military more, to perhaps justify even harsher measures, etc.
