[19:32:17] <rawktucc> Not sure how to resolve this without fucking everything up. A lot of files have already been moved, and I believe changing the obfuscation method will render the other files inaccessible
[19:37:42] <evilgohan2> It's funny: NTFS / ReFS support path lengths up to 65K / 32K characters respectively
[19:37:58] <evilgohan2> but Windows imposes a  limit of 255 characters
[19:37:59] <rawktucc> but... Windows Kernel does not
[19:38:00] <rawktucc> yeah
[19:38:03] <rawktucc> you can remove that limit though
[19:38:10] <evilgohan2> True, it's just always interesting to me.
[19:39:01] <evilgohan2> I have paths on shares that are hosted on a Windows instance. They're readable/writeable by the Linux instances that are touching them. However, while Windows can "see" them, it refuses to allow modification of them.
[19:39:16] <evilgohan2> For that matter, it won't allow  reading either.

[19:41:13] <NeoThermic> a valid file timestamp is 1601-01-01 00:00:00 to 60065-05-28 and some hours/mins/seconds
[19:41:39] <NeoThermic> 2038 is going to be interesting
[19:41:57] <rawktucc> it'll be interesting because many people will be dying in general from issues on earth, beyond tech stuff :)
[19:42:39] <evilgohan2> Well, if we're still on the Star Trek timeline, the water wars are due to begin at any time.

[20:18:39] <NeoThermic> wow, so much to start with
[20:19:14] <NeoThermic> volume snapshots are a thing, checksums, needs explaining, multiple devices, please explain, shrink/grow it can do online... and defrag isn't needed

[20:19:35] <w1kl4s> on ssds it's not, yeah
[20:19:37] <evilgohan2> SSDs exist. Defrag is not needed anymore.
[20:19:42] <w1kl4s> uuh
[20:19:53] <w1kl4s> yeah, lemme just move my 150TiB of storage into ssds
[20:20:02] <evilgohan2> Online shrink/grow is absolutely possible with NTFS
[20:20:10] <evilgohan2> Explain "multiple devices"
[20:20:26] <NeoThermic> windows itself will let you shrink/grow NTFS, so yeah :P
[20:20:31] <evilgohan2> shadow copy has existed for years
[20:20:39] <w1kl4s> you have multiple storage devices, you attach them to single filesystem
[20:20:47] <w1kl4s> mirror, stripe, parity

[20:21:44] <evilgohan2> Storage Spaces does exactly that.
[20:21:54] <w1kl4s> just like mdadm does that on linux
[20:22:04] <w1kl4s> yet stuff like btrfs and zfs does multiple devices on its own
[20:22:23] *** Quits: cosmicjoker_ (~cosmicjok@user/cosmic) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:22:30] <NeoThermic> yes, but NTFS's objectives are not the same as btrfs/zfs
[20:22:49] <NeoThermic> that's like critiquing a bike for not having a boot like a car.
[20:22:55] <evilgohan2> Which does not make the FS "impossibly garbage"
[20:23:11] <evilgohan2> Which is, honestly, rich when comparing to BTRFS and the crap that FS went through for the better part of a decade
[20:23:27] <w1kl4s> also shadow copy is not the same as COW snapshots
[20:23:40] <w1kl4s> oh, don't get me wrong, i don't like btrfs either
[20:23:42] <NeoThermic> you have devin nunes shapshots? ;)

[20:24:14] <evilgohan2> Seriously, though: that's not the purpose of NTFS - though it is for ReFS which is why it is covered there.
[20:24:36] <NeoThermic> but yes, NTFS doesn't have raid-like structures as part of its design objectives, so it's why it doesn't have it. It's not a failure of the filesystem, it just isn't the objective of it.

[20:25:18] <w1kl4s> yes, it's old
[20:25:34] <evilgohan2> and that's bad?
[20:25:43] <x10> best not bitch about old things, look at all the users inhere first :p
[20:25:46] <w1kl4s> kinda? yeah? 
[20:25:55] <evilgohan2> Explain why it being old is bad
[20:25:56] <w1kl4s> i mean, ext went throu 4 iterations from that time
[20:26:08] <NeoThermic> NTFS has been around for a long time, but NTFS today is on version... 6?
[20:26:14] <evilgohan2> Wait, you think NTFS is still the same version that was introduced in NT 3.1?
[20:26:18] <x10> ntfs isn't the same either as the original spec
[20:26:19] <w1kl4s> oh, no it's not
[20:26:21] <evilgohan2> my goodness.
[20:26:25] <rawktucc>  <w1kl4s> yeah, lemme just move my 150TiB of storage into ssds
[20:26:26] <rawktucc> dont do that
[20:26:32] <rawktucc> ext4 doesnt need defragging either
[20:26:40] <evilgohan2> They were being sarcastic rawktucc 
[20:26:40] <rawktucc> i had to defrag when i had an HDD on windows with NTFS
[20:26:42] <rawktucc> oh
[20:26:44] <w1kl4s> rawktucc i was sarcastic 
[20:26:45] <rawktucc> I need the /s :(
[20:26:53] <evilgohan2> Context helps
[20:26:57] <evilgohan2> But fair.
[20:26:59] <rawktucc> i mean i was pricing out 100TB of 8TB SSDs
[20:27:04] <w1kl4s> heh
[20:27:18] <x10> how much fragmentation do you get on 150 tib of storage? i get half of that & 80% of the  files doesn't even get touched 
[20:27:21] <x10> probably more
[20:27:28] <w1kl4s> i don't know
[20:27:35] <rawktucc> im having trouble finding where I'm gonna put all this fucking data I have because I have 42TB usable on my zfs 64TB cloud thing, and I have at least 20-30TB I know I don't want to lose
[20:27:36] <w1kl4s> i didn't deal with fragmentation since i ditched windows 
[20:27:41] <evilgohan2> I doubt very much at all unless it is a lot of transient data.
[20:27:41] <w1kl4s> that was a decade ago
[20:28:01] <w1kl4s> because zfs fragmentation is a different fragmentation than what ntfs does on hdds
[20:28:17] <rawktucc> which is why I was kinda upset going with zfs but then again I'd rather have reliable data storage tbh
[20:28:24] <rawktucc> when i know im not modifying the stored data
[20:28:31] <rawktucc> it was either that or snapraid. there wasn't really another option
[20:28:39] <w1kl4s> rawktucc don't worry about it, again
[20:28:45] <w1kl4s> it's a different kind of fragmentation
[20:28:54] <x10> my point exactly evilgohan2 , people bitching about fragmentation like it's something they'll have troubles with for their iso/movie/tv collection.
[20:28:55] <rawktucc> no I meant file integrity and avoiding data corruption
[20:28:59] <evilgohan2> I'm... not entirely sure you understand how fragmentation physically works.
[20:29:12] * rawktucc steps out of the convo for now
[20:29:22] <evilgohan2> lol x10
[20:30:04] <w1kl4s> x10 my point is that this is an issue resolved everywhere but ntfs for i don't know
[20:30:06] <evilgohan2> To be honest, I'm also not entirely sure you understand how ZFS performs writes if you're harping on fragmentation in the way that you are.
[20:30:06] <w1kl4s> good 10 years
[20:30:08] <w1kl4s> maybe more
[20:30:56] <w1kl4s> rawktucc zfs frag% means free space fragmentation
[20:30:59] <w1kl4s> not data present
[20:31:48] <evilgohan2> Just to be clear: every write in ZFS, even for an existing file, is written to a free block. Blocks that are overwritten and/or deleted don't get freed until absolutely nothing is pointing to them. To that point, literally anything that gets modified under ZFS gets fragmented by design the moment it is modified beyond its original state on write (assuming all writes were to contiguous blocks)
[20:31:53] <w1kl4s> it's inherent property of full-COW filesystems 
[20:32:08] <rawktucc> how do I show all info on a pool
[20:32:10] <evilgohan2> You're comparing apples to grapefruits

[20:39:56] <evilgohan2> No possibility of leaving it running at home?
[20:40:08] <evilgohan2> Or is "home" changing?
[20:40:17] <rawktucc> Home will become anywhere and everywhere I feel
[20:40:25] <evilgohan2> Ah
[20:40:34] <rawktucc> At some point though where I'm at right now, parents house, they will sell and move to a small place for themselves
[20:40:36] <evilgohan2> Profile roaming.
[20:41:03] <NeoThermic> I ponder if co-location would be cheaper?
[20:41:11] <evilgohan2> Quite possibly.
[20:41:12] <rawktucc> I can leave my current machine running at home while travelling, but realistically it's just not a good idea. At home things move around kinda often enough that I worry the server would get bonked, damaged, whatever. If a drive fails, well shit then I'm really screwed
[20:41:34] <rawktucc> co-lo would be even worse. There's nothing locally that's affordable, and driving this behemoth to Montreal or Toronto would be stupid
[20:42:03] <rawktucc> at least at home, if I implemented hot swap bays, I could give instructions on how to pop open the thing, remove the thing, put the new drive in, go... but still that's just not a good idea
[20:43:22] <rawktucc> colo Affordable locally, wht I mean is compare to something offered by hetzner: for 189 EURO (280 CAD)  I'm not sure I can find somewhere to put a 100TB, let alone 160TV+2x1TB NVME server, plus support for swapping bad drives, plus guaranteed uptime, plus guaranteed gigabit in europe
[20:43:46] <NeoThermic> I have a little two bay at my parents place for smaller stuff, and yeah, I just picked a good out-of-the-way location for it
[20:43:53] <rawktucc> really the biggest problem is just: if a drive fails, or something fails... the system is a dud until I repair it. I'm not flying half way around the world to replace a drive.
[20:43:57] <NeoThermic> I do know they're moving soon, so I'll need to ensure it's last-thing movable
[20:44:22] <rawktucc> Yeah I'll be setting up a pi at least to stay here, for truly "I don't wanna lose this" data. and it's easy to buy 2x5TB 2.5" drives and connect those over USB 3.0 in a cage or something
[20:44:38] <rawktucc> and if that dies, tell them to hook up the other one and I can do a remote repair. Silent system, no issues, not in their way
[20:47:59] <rawktucc> but that's not feasible for 100TB, unless I drop ~$12337 CAD on 13x8TB SAMSUNG QVO SSDs
[20:48:12] <NeoThermic> hah
[20:48:17] <rawktucc> the whole point I mean to make is that the HDDs are not reliable in a situation where a system is setup at home, but there's risk of damage.
[20:48:29] <NeoThermic> at that price colo would be better even if it meant lugging the thing afar
[20:48:32] <rawktucc> whereas with SSDs, if someone bumps it, there's not that much risk really. I've been rough with SSDs, they can tak it
[20:48:42] <rawktucc> for 12337 yes I'd colo or rent hetzners server
[20:48:50] <rawktucc> I really might just rent that 160TB Hetzner machine
[20:49:10] <evilgohan2> ngl, if I had the cash, I'd 100% look into 8TB QVOs and drop all spinning HDDs
[20:49:14] <evilgohan2> The noise reduction
[20:49:18] <rawktucc> yes definitely
[20:49:20] <evilgohan2> The lower power usage.
[20:49:27] <rawktucc> in a sense... if I sold a few things, yes I'd have that cash
[20:49:33] <rawktucc> but it makes no... no no no sense at all to do that
[20:49:35] <NeoThermic> TBH if I had the cash I'd look into U3 SSD setups
[20:49:42] <rawktucc> when I could buy more 18TBs 
[20:50:04] <rawktucc> OH dont forget it's QLC too :)
[20:50:39] <evilgohan2> for archiving old software, isos, documents, etc. and not concerned about IOPS? Meh. QLC is fine.

[20:50:55] <rawktucc> it's the videos that are a bitch
[20:51:05] <rawktucc> remuxing, editing, encoding even sometimes I've seen IOPS get in the way
[20:51:21] <NeoThermic> just have some non-raid nvme for hot editing
[20:51:25] <NeoThermic> and push it to the raid when done
[20:51:25] <evilgohan2> Yea
[20:51:36] <evilgohan2> That's what scratch disks are for
[20:51:38] <NeoThermic> it's what I do for my photo editing
[20:51:46] <rawktucc> yeah I have something like tahat rn. I have 100GB of game footage to edit on my primary SSD
[20:52:01] <rawktucc> i record to ffv1 and re-export to ffv1, even if edited with overlays
[20:52:02] <evilgohan2> I have 2 mSATAs in RAID0 sitting in a USB enclosure for something similar, NeoThermic 
[20:52:05] <NeoThermic> dump the card onto scratch + RAID as unedited, edit on scratch, push edits to RAID in different folder
[20:52:11] <evilgohan2> Also, why does StarTech make EVERYTHING lol
[20:52:17] <evilgohan2> I need it, StarTech has it and no one else
[20:52:20] <rawktucc> Yeah :D

[20:52:42] <NeoThermic> they have a really nice USB-C to 3xDP thing that I want
[20:52:47] <rawktucc> their KVM units are literally rock solid. heavy, work very well, but expensive
[20:52:59] <rawktucc> they build stuff that actually works per the advertised specs
[20:53:44] <NeoThermic> that is indeed their best part
[20:53:55] <NeoThermic> want to connect X to Y and ensure it's in spec? they'll have it

[20:58:56] <NeoThermic> damn straight
[21:00:50] <rawktucc> i need one of those electronics vacuums
[21:00:59] <rawktucc> the ones that either push, rather than pull, or have some kind of anti-static stuff inside
[21:02:40] <rawktucc> I gave some thought about renting the SX134: https://litter.catbox.moe/vjtiya.txt
[21:03:59] <rawktucc> it's expensive for a whole year but I'm more like... consider what's offered
[21:04:14] <rawktucc> if you're living a digital nomad lifestyle; moving around a lot, travelling, etc
[21:04:57] <evilgohan2> That honestly gets expxensive
[21:05:07] <evilgohan2> I used to buy gaming laptops for that reason.
[21:05:07] <rawktucc> which part of all this
[21:05:28] <evilgohan2> But, no matter how much you spend on one, it gets power crept hard.
[21:05:37] <rawktucc> yeah but I can't fit 160TB in a gaming laptop. I'm waiting for the steam deck to come on sale, which should replace a Thinkpad X260
[21:05:44] <rawktucc> and gaming, no problem for me. I'll compromise.
[21:05:48] <evilgohan2> I'm just making a point regarding that lifestyle.
[21:05:53] <rawktucc> oh yeah definitely
[21:06:13] <rawktucc> i'm really, really excited about the steam deck though. it has serious promise for the form factor, and seems like an ultimate compromise on design, size, weight, and power
[21:06:17] <rawktucc> data storage, is more like a mental illness
[21:06:32] <rawktucc> i've misplaced my keyboard box which has my key puller upper thing
[21:07:11] <evilgohan2> I've been going through some of my stuff and starting to delete things. I said to myself "I'm likely never looking at this again", or "If I haven't bothered with this by now, I'm not going to."
[21:08:00] <x10> yeah should start doing that
[21:08:17] <x10> noticed this week i was downloading tv show that i haven't watched in at least 10 years :/
[21:08:23] <rawktucc> Yeah I am doing that too
[21:08:38] <rawktucc> it's just a looooot of stuff I actually can't because well
[21:08:52] <rawktucc> I deleted like every season of modern family once that show ended. what a waste of time watching that
[21:09:01] <rawktucc> all the years spent watching it. ripping the DVDs too
[21:09:17] <evilgohan2> I do wonder about deleting some series. Like, I've watched them by now. Am I goign to watch them again ever? Unlikely.
[21:09:35] <evilgohan2> Some, yes, I have rewatched. But, by and large, there's no way I'm rewatching 8 seasons of Arrow as an example.
[21:10:22] <rawktucc> Yeah I got that feel with MoFam basically
[21:10:44] <rawktucc> that said I have recently rewatched a few shows with like 7-8 seasons, i thought i never would but i got such a desire to
[21:11:06] <evilgohan2> It's not the length of the series so much as it is that most of it sucked lol
[21:11:16] <rawktucc> lol
[21:11:28] <rawktucc> my keyboard button picker upper thing IS MISSING
[21:12:11] <evilgohan2> I'll happily burn 584GB archiving Star Trek TNG because that series is good and I would definitely rewatch (which is why I bought the blu-ray pack to begin with). Not even in succession. I'll just pick a random episode and watch it.
[21:12:45] <evilgohan2> The Wire? Absolutely.
[21:13:45] <evilgohan2> I could probably delete a lot of other stuff here and never miss it.
