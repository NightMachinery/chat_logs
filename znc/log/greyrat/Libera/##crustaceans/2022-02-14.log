[03:25:07] <manicennui> Completed in 2020 at a cost of $5.5 billion, the 70,000-capacity venue – which will be expanded to seat 100,000 for the Superbowl – is the most expensive stadium ever built.
[03:25:46] <manicennui> "It's not just a stadium," explained Evans. "In fact, the 6,000-seat YouTube Theater and 2.5-acre American Airlines Plaza are also under that one massive, swooping roof, which also protects the NFL's largest stadium."

[06:18:51] <manicennui> "The place I was looking at last month raised their rent another $100. IN JUST ONE MONTH. HOW THE FUCK ARE WE SUPPOSED TO AFFORD A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS?"
[06:20:53] <manicennui> Apparently inflation in Tampa is even worse.
[06:21:08] <manicennui> Almost 10%.

[06:21:48] <buttsbot> Is Tampa Bay’s housing market reaching its peak?
[06:21:56] <manicennui> The average home sold for 41 percent above the expected price at the end of 2021, a Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University study found.
[06:22:12] <manicennui> Nationwide, Tampa Bay was ranked 14th on a list of overvalued markets behind Boise City, Austin and Phoenix. Miami was the least overvalued market in Florida.
[06:22:20] <manicennui> Crazy.
[06:22:28] <manicennui> When are people going to riot and take heads?
[06:22:58] <imode> when they genuinely have no other option.
[06:25:08] <manicennui> I'm thinking I should wait for the inevitable crash at this point.
[06:25:13] <manicennui> There is no way this can continue.
[06:26:05] <manicennui> "Because Florida was hit hard by the 2008 recession, homes across the state were deeply undervalued into the 2010s, Wedge said."
[06:26:07] <manicennui> Bullshit.
[06:26:32] <manicennui> Prices were still too high everywhere.
[06:26:39] <imode> it's going to fall, and it's going to fall hard.
[06:27:11] <manicennui> My only worry is that it will just become impossible for anyone but corporations to buy, and then they will buy everything up and rent it out.
[06:27:28] <manicennui> And no one will have any choice but to pay their rates.
[06:27:32] <imode> that's what's going to happen.
[06:27:37] <manicennui> And no politician will do a thing about it.
[06:27:42] <imode> then we riot.
[06:28:07] <imode> when survival becomes truly untenable, all options are open, because the only alternative is to die.
[06:30:46] <manicennui> Something's gotta give.
[06:30:52] <manicennui> Too much evil shit going on.
[06:31:14] <manicennui> In some fucked up way, I even think this is probably why most of the right wingers are acting out.
[06:31:30] <manicennui> They are just too dumb to realize who is fucking them.
[06:31:54] <manicennui> As if everything would be fine if only they weren't asked to wear masks and be vaccinated.
[06:32:53] <manicennui> "Sorensen moved from Nashville with her husband for work. While shopping around for homes last year, sellers asked Sorensen to sign a contingency that they would pay the difference in the appraisal if they were going to place an offer. Some sellers prioritized offers that would forgo an inspection."
[06:33:06] <manicennui> "She and her husband ended up paying $12,000 out of pocket to cover the appraisal difference"
[06:33:06] <manicennui> JFC
[06:34:15] <imode> the markets are going to burn.
[06:38:45] <manicennui> Somehow I doubt it.
[06:39:10] <manicennui> And somehow those at the top will still profit from it all.
[06:39:15] <manicennui> Look at the pandemic.
[06:39:43] <manicennui> Huge scam programs to transfer tax money to businesses.
[06:43:32] <imode> what are we going to do about it? we already have high power high paying jobs.
[06:44:24] <manicennui> I mean, I do. You are fucked. =P
[06:44:41] <imode> soon to not be fucked.
[06:44:49] <manicennui> Getting a raise?
[06:45:09] <imode> comp portal opened on the 9th, discussing talent and comp on the 15th, tuesday.
[06:46:07] <manicennui> My coworkers are all super disappointed. I think a good raise was 4-5%.
[06:46:33] <manicennui> I'm disappointed because I was told that I was going to receive a substantial increase. I did get more than most people, but nothing like I expected.
[06:46:45] <manicennui> Nothing that would keep me there if I actually wanted to leave.
[06:47:43] <manicennui> Boss basically told me that we might lose a couple people, but there is nothing she can do about it.
[06:48:12] <imode> because comp is decided from the top.
[06:48:47] <manicennui> Yeah. Our CEO told everyone in our quarterly meeting last week that our merit pool was larger than ever. Almost double what it was in the past.
[06:49:13] <manicennui> My boss said that is because of the company we acquired a couple years ago that doubled the size of the company.
[06:49:22] <manicennui> Pool was slightly better than last year, but not like double per person.
[06:50:09] <manicennui> Don't know why execs do shit like that.
[06:50:14] <manicennui> Only going to piss people off.
[07:00:44] <imode> shot caller has to be the best "scare you straight" movie.
[07:01:01] <imode> it's fucking terrifying.
[07:01:17] <manicennui> We need more movies about execs going to prison and being brutalized.
[07:01:28] <imode> I mean, that's the movie.
[07:01:35] <manicennui> Ah.

[07:02:03] <imode> yyyyyyep.
[07:02:11] <imode> not before some shit though.
[07:02:14] <imode> it doesn't glorify any of it.
[07:02:14] <manicennui> Yeah, I meant that they are bottom bitches.
[07:02:22] <imode> yeah.
[07:02:30] <imode> trust me, it's worth a watch.
[07:02:36] <manicennui> No doubt.
[07:02:42] <manicennui> Just need some films to give people ideas.
[07:03:39] <manicennui> Maybe some movies about people rioting and murdering execs and politicians.

[07:07:51] <buttsbot> Ban Corporations from owning Single Family Housing : RealEstate
[07:08:06] <manicennui> An entire discussion where asshole defend landlords and corporations owning homes.
[07:08:23] <manicennui> "For argument sake, the benefit of large institutions owning SFHs, assuming they’re renting them, is that this provides more rentable housing to people in suburbs. It’s hard to rent in a lot of suburbs, outside of city."
[07:08:52] <manicennui> So instead of the houses being actually affordable, someone has to own them to rent them out!
[07:09:53] <manicennui> "If they’re buying them to sell them later, they’re hopefully repairing for improving the home that people typically don’t want to do; so, they, like flippers, are specializing in improving houses."
[07:09:53] <imode> jfc I need to stop watching this for my mental health.
[07:10:29] <manicennui> They're just fixing them up for the poor dumb bastards who can't afford to, and making massive profits doing it!
[07:11:34] <manicennui> All of this is pushing me toward buying land, but who knows what will happen with materials and construction in the future.
[07:11:35] <imode> what the fuck can we do, manicennui.
[07:12:05] <manicennui> Increase our wealth.
[07:12:11] <manicennui> No other way to win.
[07:12:27] <imode> pretty much my only goal.
[07:12:41] <manicennui> Start some shitty site and sell it to one of the bit shitty tech companies.
[07:13:34] <imode> my only goal is to earn enough for my family. two households.
[07:14:07] <manicennui> The only problem with doing it through work, even a well paying SE job, is that costs are rising too quickly now.
[07:14:10] <imode> $152k/yr base means everything's more than fine for the next five years at least.
[07:14:16] <imode> yeah. but I don't have any debt.
[07:14:21] <manicennui> Nor do I.
[07:14:50] <imode> means I can leverage some creative financing while my debt to income ratio is low.
[07:14:52] <manicennui> How likely do you think it is that they are going to give you that much?
[07:15:09] <imode> pretty significant, actually. I had someone pre-approve me for a $1.5m home.
[07:15:29] <imode> I didn't take it because the mortgage payments alone are double my rent.
[07:15:45] <imode> if you're talking about a raise increase, remember, I make $120k.
[07:15:49] <manicennui> I would never go 10x my salary.
[07:16:31] <manicennui> Yes, but $32k is almost 30%.
[07:16:43] <imode> and I haven't gotten any kind of raise, bonus or equity increase for two years.
[07:16:53] <imode> not even a COL increase.
[07:17:13] <imode> it's been the fuckin' same since I started, and they stated both to the media and internally that they're raising _everybody_ up.
[07:17:32] <manicennui> Yeah, that sucks, but that doesn't seem like it would make it more likely that they would treat you well now.
[07:17:45] <imode> then I will simply jump ship to whoever will.
[07:17:58] <manicennui> Well, I hope they do.
[07:17:59] <imode> you've gotta understand, everyone here is making near the maximum salary.
[07:18:04] <imode> I'm the straggler.
[07:18:13] <imode> it's the equity and bonuses that fluctuate.
[07:18:34] <imode> me, they got me cheap. but my equity has kept me afloat, just barely, for the past two years because it essentially _doubled_ since I joined.
[07:18:45] <imode> that and the fact that I know how to day trade worth a damn.
[07:19:18] <imode> in 2019, I was desperate for a job and thought I was the worst programmer on earth, couldn't pass an interview, couldn't get anything.
[07:20:28] <imode> two years later and I've turned myself around mentally for the better.
[07:20:28] <companion_cube> hope the housing market becomes reasonable quickly :-°
[07:21:05] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't have any hope.
[07:21:22] <manicennui> The housing market, general cost of living, police reform, right wing terrorism.
[07:21:33] <manicennui> There are no signs that any of this is getting better.
[07:22:24] <imode> if the entire country goes to shit, I have a 6 acre property that I can hide out at.
[07:22:34] <imode> just need to get to it.
[07:22:44] <manicennui> "January 2022 U.S. Foreclosure Market Report shows foreclosure filings were up 29% from a month ago and up 139% from a year ago."
[07:22:45] <imode> food, water, shelter, material.
[07:23:59] <manicennui> I'd gladly give up all kinds of shit, but almost none of it would substantially decrease my expenses.
[07:25:43] <imode> $2.6k for their rent, $2.3k+ for mine.
[07:25:54] <imode> we barely have enough as is. my pantry is empty.
[07:26:41] <manicennui> I wish I were close to my family.
[07:26:49] <manicennui> Not that they would help me. Most of them are way worse off.
[07:27:20] <manicennui> On the one hand I think we'd all be way better off if most of us lived on family estates passed down from generation to generation.
[07:27:32] <manicennui> On the other hand, I would not want to live with most of my family.
[07:27:48] <imode> I thankfully live 20 miles away.
[07:27:51] <manicennui> Maybe my brother wouldn't be as terrible if he had grown up in such an environment though.
[07:28:08] <imode> my mother started teaching me how to drive today, it was nice. more intuitive than I thought.
[07:28:25] <manicennui> I'm about 30 miles from my father and his mother.
[07:28:37] <manicennui> Oh? Don't have your license?
[07:28:49] <imode> nope, never learned how to drive. there's a reason my 'rents don't work.
[07:28:57] <imode> tragic accident in 2012 claimed my mother's eyes, and my father's back.
[07:29:00] <manicennui> One good thing about growing up in the suburbs is that I got my license.
[07:29:09] <imode> I was 16.
[07:29:14] <manicennui> Sorry to hear that.
[07:29:26] <imode> 's fine. they're healthy but still injured now.
[07:29:47] <imode> they just never taught me how to drive. spent 3 or 4 years recovering, my mother's brain injury will affect her for the rest of her life.
[07:29:52] <imode> my father's spinal injury will as well.
[07:30:25] <imode> by the time I went to college, they could barely leave our home.
[07:30:31] <manicennui> My mother died from cancer when I was 16 (it was a *long* time ago).
[07:30:44] <imode> fuck. I'm sorry.
[07:30:52] <manicennui> I can't imagine having disabled parents.
[07:31:17] <imode> they get by. they're older now. 61 and 66.
[07:31:37] <imode> still have autonomy. just.. not in the fields they could want. my mother worked in banking and small business development.
[07:31:57] <manicennui> After my mother died I lived with her parents. Several years later I watched my grandfather die from cancer (we weren't very close). I had to help with things like getting him off the toilet, and rolling him on his side so a nurse could clear impacted feces.
[07:31:58] <imode> my father was a rough framer, coastguardman, and boiler plant operator.
[07:32:05] <manicennui> I don't know how people do that sort of thing all the time.
[07:32:08] <manicennui> I could never be a nurse.
[07:32:17] <imode> it has to be desensitizing at some point.
[07:33:26] <imode> like, you just get used to the futility.
[07:33:38] <imode> lives come and go.
[07:33:48] <manicennui> I'm half tempted to buy a house far out in the suburbs with a couple acres and letting my father know he can live with me if he wants. He is currently living with his mother in her condo.
[07:34:06] <imode> you and I should pool money and just buy a 30 acre property somewhere in fuckoff PNW.
[07:34:16] <imode> I take 15, you take 15.
[07:34:19] <imode> we group taxes.
[07:34:21] <manicennui> My only real concerns are that there isn't a lot of natural beauty here, and I don't think I could deal with my brother if he ever decided to come back into my father's life.
[07:35:29] <manicennui> We'd definitely be better off if groups of us got together to own land and build houses.
[07:35:50] <imode> communal land development.
[07:35:59] <imode> I don't see why the fuck we couldn't.
[07:36:00] <manicennui> I know there are some intentional communities that have everything owned by some kind of organization, and lease houses out.
[07:36:15] <imode> there are 20, 30 acre lots up north here that sell for sub $150k.
[07:36:50] <imode> I'm a first time home/property buyer so banks wanna butter my ass with such low debt to income ratio.

[07:39:36] <imode> you pool money, buy the lot, then transfer half of the lot to each of the parties.
[07:39:59] <imode> or a 3rd, or 4th, etc.
[07:40:15] <imode> acting collectively is a power play.
[07:40:36] <manicennui> Assuming you can tolerate the people long term.
[07:40:42] <manicennui> They talk about that in that video.
[07:40:53] <imode> if it's a large enough lot of land, why the hell would you not.
[07:41:11] <imode> $150k / 2 is 75k, low enough for a personal loan.
[07:41:19] <manicennui> Well, they are not spread out, so the problems are probably increase for them. Lot of shared resources.
[07:41:38] <imode> 230 people is excessive, but 3 or 4 software engineers?
[07:42:01] <imode> pool enough to acquire and do some basic land development.
[07:42:12] <manicennui> Other than having more money on average, I don't know that software engineers would be my top choice.
[07:42:33] <imode> you have to start with a lot of capital or financing options.
[07:43:35] <imode> seriously, go buy, divide and build.
[07:43:42] <manicennui> I have more than enough cash for land at this point. My issue right now is that I'd like to be able to move this year. Also, materials are super expensive right now, and there aren't enough people in construction available.
[07:44:16] <imode> where are you looking to move?
[07:44:32] <manicennui> My top choice right now is western North Carolina.
[07:45:07] <manicennui> I like the PNW, but I think they are going to continue to have serious water issues.
[07:45:14] <bkero> You can buy the adjoining 3 acres next to mine in Hawaii.
[07:45:25] <bkero> No water issues there: 200 inches of rain per year
[07:45:39] <manicennui> In Hawaii?
[07:45:42] <bkero> also it's $10-70k
[07:45:53] <bkero> In this part of Hawaii, yes.
[07:46:02] <imode> hawaii is fucking expensive.
[07:46:32] <bkero> If you're expecting to eat what you eat now, definitely.
[07:46:48] <imode> what
[07:46:48] <manicennui> Western NC doesn't get much more rain than Portland, but all of Portland rain comes in just 3-4 months.
[07:46:51] <imode> *what's the alternative.
[07:46:57] <bkero> Eating things grown on the island.
[07:47:05] <manicennui> Portland's
[07:47:10] <imode> such as?
[07:47:14] <imode> that sounds awesome.
[07:47:18] <bkero> Pineapple, acovado, eggs
[07:47:21] <bkero> avocado*
[07:47:26] <imode> doesn't seem that bad to me.
[07:47:27] <manicennui> Lava.
[07:47:31] <bkero> Things that doesn't have to ship from the mainland
[07:47:34] <bkero> don't* fuck
[07:47:48] <imode> isn't it also packed with people.
[07:47:56] <imode> and hot as fuck.
[07:48:00] <bkero> You can totally go to the grocery store and spend $20/lb on a steak shipped from the mainland, but that's not much more than you're already paying in New Seasons or Whole Foods.
[07:48:09] <bkero> Puna is not packed with people. Each plot is 1-3 acres.
[07:48:22] <bkero> Oahu is definitely packed with people
[07:48:38] <bkero> Puna has wild hogs and dogs running around that you have to deal with though.
[07:48:45] <imode> mm.
[07:48:49] <bkero> So fences (sometimes electric)
[07:49:11] <imode> what about construction? the land may be cheap, but construction material is probably more expensive.
[07:49:20] <bkero> Yeah, that is a problem
[07:49:31] <bkero> My primary plan is to get a yurt shipped from Oregon from Pacific Yurts
[07:49:37] <bkero> Secondary plan if that proves too expensive is to use a prefab
[07:49:42] <manicennui> Delicious dogs?
[07:49:52] <imode> prefab is probably the ideal.
[07:49:53] <bkero> There are prefab home builders on the big island which sell 1300sqft units for around $100k
[07:50:02] <imode> damn.
[07:50:07] <imode> that's not a lot but that's not a lot.
[07:50:09] <bkero> Then you need someone to clear the land, pour the concrete slab for it, and set up off-grid utilities.
[07:50:16] <imode> money and space respectively.
[07:50:19] <manicennui> Amazon should do what Sears did and ship houses.

[07:50:37] <imode> what about medical?
[07:50:46] <imode> do I have to island hop to get my wife to a hospital?
[07:51:01] <bkero> Nope
[07:51:05] <bkero> Hilo is a 30 minute drive north
[07:51:20] <imode> mm.
[07:51:20] <bkero> If you buy the wrong plot it's more like an hour though
[07:51:31] <imode> still seems incredibly risky.
[07:51:31] <bkero> and I think they put a clinic in Pahoa nearby for smaller stuff
[07:51:46] <imode> wife used to live on oahu though..
[07:52:03] <imode> her dad was in the military.
[07:52:10] <imode> mm.
[07:52:23] <imode> how's the food delivery there, nonexistent?
[07:52:50] <bkero> Good question
[07:52:58] <bkero> I haven't checked. You might get some Uber Eats drivers to come down from Hilo
[07:53:20] <bkero> You can put an address into Uber Eats from Hawaii Paradise Estates and see who delivers
[07:53:34] <imode> point taken.
[07:53:42] <bkero> You could also go outside and pick a mango from your tree
[07:53:47] <bkero> and tomatoes and avocado and make guac
[07:53:53] <manicennui> My plan is to stop relying on delivered food, and most prepared food in general.
[07:53:56] <bkero> Year round
[07:54:10] <imode> any meat native to the island?
[07:54:13] <imode> need some protein.
[07:54:23] <bkero> Yeah
[07:54:25] <bkero> Wild hogs
[07:54:31] <bkero> and chickens
[07:54:36] <imode> tell me I don't have to kill and butcher my own shit.
[07:54:40] <bkero> Sorry, red jungle fowl cross-bred with domestic chickens
[07:54:49] <bkero> Nah there are people there who will butcher and pack for you
[07:54:57] <bkero> You might have to kill it and tell them to come pick it up though
[07:55:03] <bkero> or let your electric fence do the work
[07:56:31] <bkero> You can be part of this cringey community if you want to as well: https://punaweb.org/forum/index.php
[07:56:32] <buttsbot> Punaweb Forum
[07:56:57] <imode> interesting.
[07:57:04] <imode> ..are you worried about the rising sea levels?
[07:57:20] <bkero> Insofar as it's going to fuck over the rest of the world.
[07:57:33] <bkero> You can get stuff that's 1500ft in elevation if you want
[07:57:38] <bkero> Down near Volcano, HI
[07:57:49] <bkero> You do pay more for that and it's too high to grow mangos
[07:58:15] <bkero> I'm looking at stuff that's 200-500ft in elevation. If the sea rises 500 feet we're all boned.
[07:58:26] <imode> are you -currently- in hawaii?
[07:58:32] <bkero> Negative. I'm in El Salvador.
[07:58:40] <bkero> I should be in Hawaii looking at real estate right now
[07:58:44] <bkero> but I got lazy and didn't book a ticket

[07:59:07] <bkero> I'm taking an agriculture friend over there next month to go scout properties. While I get my land loan application through First Hawaiian Bank
[07:59:23] <imode> mm.
[07:59:27] <bkero> They have 3 year interest-only loans for land that can get rolled into a conventional mortgage when you get your shit together and the prefab people come by to do the work.
[07:59:35] <imode> good lord.
[07:59:37] <bkero> but with land costing ~$40k I might just buy it
[07:59:39] <imode> that's.. amazing.

[07:59:58] <buttsbot> Land Loans Hawaii | First Hawaiian Bank
[07:59:59] <manicennui> My plan is to buy some land in cash and hold it for a few years.
[08:00:03] <imode> damn.
[08:00:13] <manicennui> Save up more then apply for a construction loan.
[08:00:24] <imode> that's what I'm gearing up to do.
[08:00:29] <bkero> If I wait too late I'm going to have to give them 2020/2021 tax returns and W2s instead of 2019/2020 and that's going to be a pain in the ass.

[08:01:25] <bkero> Wired for fiber, fuck yeah.
[08:01:26] <imode> I really need to be making more money before I do any of this.
[08:01:44] <imode> jesus fuck.
[08:01:47] * manicennui starts a new movement
[08:01:48] <imode> is that your plot?
[08:01:51] <bkero> No
[08:01:51] <manicennui> Hi Tech Hill Billies
[08:01:53] <bkero> I wish
[08:02:05] <bkero> I plan to buy something similar
[08:02:12] <imode> buy it and never touch it. that's prime nature.
[08:02:16] <bkero> and be a hermit while I get shit built out
[08:02:44] <manicennui> bkero: I assume you already know this, but cheap land can cost as much as its selling price to prep for building.
[08:02:51] <manicennui> Often why it is cheap.
[08:03:07] <bkero> manicennui: Land around there does have challenges. The good stuff has 18 inches of topsoil, then lava bed.
[08:03:14] <bkero> Clearing the land is $3-5k/acre
[08:03:22] <bkero> $1k/acre if you just tell the dozer to go brrr
[08:03:27] <imode> I wouldn't bother clearing a grand majority of it.
[08:03:30] <bkero> I want to keep the fruit trees and good native plants
[08:03:32] <imode> just enough for the house.
[08:03:39] <imode> nothing more.
[08:03:39] <bkero> and yes, plants provide good privacy
[08:03:47] <bkero> Being able to walk the perimeter of your land is nice
[08:03:54] <bkero> Otherwise shit can go on with your land that you don't know about
[08:04:01] <imode> install nature cams.
[08:04:14] <bkero> Those will go 5 feet and then hit bushes
[08:04:22] <imode> meh.
[08:04:23] <bkero> this is *thick* jungle
[08:04:24] <imode> there are ways.
[08:04:32] <bkero> Yeah, you could put towers in to see the canopy
[08:04:49] <imode> nature is precious and must be preserved.
[08:04:50] <bkero> and I do plan on putting solar panel + smartphone as minimum viable security system in a tree first of all
[08:05:17] <bkero> Some of the nature around there is invasive trees that need to go away
[08:05:20] <manicennui> imode: We must stop the biggest threat to nature: humans.
[08:05:34] <bkero> Weak branches that fall over in wind and wreck your shit
[08:05:58] <imode> invasive, sure, prune it.
[08:06:02] <imode> then let it die on its own.
[08:06:07] <imode> the rest, leave it.
[08:06:40] <bkero> I'd rather rip up the invasives and make surf boards out of them
[08:06:53] <bkero> and let the sacred ohai trees grow back
[08:06:56] <imode> amen.
[08:07:03] <bkero> and lychees and ramutans, etc
[08:07:50] <bkero> So another problem is that you need to be on kind of a slope so you can have a cesspool put in part of it for your sewage
[08:07:56] <bkero> and all the other delightful rural problems
[08:08:09] <manicennui> Imagine how incredible North America was 500 years ago.
[08:08:31] <bkero> Imagine what London *smelled* like 500 years ago.
[08:12:11] <manicennui> I want to know more about well water treatment. My only experience with well water was my aunt's place, and the water was pretty terrible. I don't know whether that was because she wasn't treating it correctly or if there was nothing to be done.
[08:12:54] <bkero> The well water comes from an aquafer
[08:13:01] <bkero> The aquafer could have ...stuff in it
[08:13:17] <manicennui> Her water turned everything yellow and had a sulfur smell.
[08:13:19] <bkero> West of Portland there's an aquafer that supplies Banks and points west. It has a *large* amount of sulfur
[08:13:22] <bkero> The tap water smells like farts.
[08:13:41] <bkero> Yeah that's gross. You can get activated charcoal or reverse osmosis filters to get rid of that
[08:13:54] <imode> yeah, just filter everything by reverse osmosis.
[08:14:19] <manicennui> The suburb she lived in is almost all well water, but all the homes have large lots. Often over an acre.
[08:14:52] <manicennui> I don't know why she wouldn't have treated it properly. She is basically rich.
[08:15:00] <manicennui> Might have been less so at the time, but they certainly had money.
[08:15:38] <imode> probably didn't know how.
[08:15:51] <manicennui> Their house was definitely a bit of a mess.
[08:16:14] <manicennui> And her husband was kind of a hippie.
[08:16:26] <manicennui> Which was interesting, since he is the one who made a fuckton of money as a lawyer.
[08:17:12] <manicennui> I guess that was common with the hippies from that time.
[08:17:52] <imode> it's easy to be a hippy if you're loaded.
[08:18:15] <manicennui> I think it was more like they were hippies when they were young, then got jobs and started doing well.
[08:18:44] <imode> that movie depressed the fuck out of me.
[08:19:49] <manicennui> I'm surprised that companies aren't buying up land too.
[08:20:07] <manicennui> Maybe they'll do that after there are no houses left to buy.
[08:20:37] <imode> with my luck, I'll be ready to buy in a year. and there will be nothing left.
[08:21:29] <manicennui> Doesn't seem like land is being snapped up.
[08:21:43] <manicennui> Everything I look at has been on the market for months or years.
[08:22:15] <imode> good.
[08:22:23] <imode> then it's a good time to be a guy with a plan.
[08:22:26] <manicennui> The biggest problem is that a lot of what is available is hard to build on.
[08:22:33] <manicennui> Or is nowhere near a major city.
[08:22:52] <imode> I'm okay with the latter point.
[08:23:12] <manicennui> That also means nowhere near good healthcare though.
[08:23:37] <imode> mm..
[08:23:41] <imode> so, diversify.
[08:23:58] <imode> my intension is to have footholds on the east and west coast.
[08:24:19] <imode> perhaps in canada as well.
[08:24:26] <imode> why stop at a single property.
[08:24:34] <manicennui> Pittsburgh area is pretty affordable, and there is good healthcare there.
[08:24:39] <manicennui> Also near nature.
[08:25:16] <imode> I wonder, is this housing BS affecting europe? the nordics?
[08:25:55] <manicennui> I don't know, but I recently saw some pretty amazing estates in Italy that weren't outrageously expensive.
[08:26:14] <imode> it's hard to choose where to exist right now.
[08:26:29] <manicennui> Like 500k euros for some picturesque estate with several acres.
[08:26:31] <imode> especially if you're trying to look forward to _when_ I have money.
[08:26:46] <imode> vs. now, when I don't. forming plans is useless unless you have a savings.
[08:31:58] <bkero> There are some great estates in Italy
[08:32:14] <bkero> I might have a small piece of that pie
[08:33:30] <bkero> https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/2e6bc9f8-8b3e-11ec-a837-0153f5f4adaf?shareToken=fc4cb2e442644ec86cf5b36fff2d94d9
[08:34:14] <imode> I just want to hurry up and get my parents' debt destroyed, buy a giant fuck off plot of land and set them up with a 3k sqft house to do whatever they want in.
[08:34:34] <imode> life is moving too slow and everything's moving towards total destruction.

[08:34:41] <buttsbot> 4 bedroom house for sale in La Tartaruga, Arezzo, Tuscany | Abode SRL
[08:34:47] <imode> but by fucking god I'm trying to remain positive.
[08:34:53] <manicennui> 2 hectares
[08:35:03] <manicennui> 595k euros
[08:35:04] <imode> otherwise I'll slip-'n-slide down into suicidal contemplation.
[08:35:18] <manicennui> The house is set in 2 hectares of olive groves on a wooded hillside, enjoying a panoramic view of the Chiana valley right across to Cortona in the East and across the hillside to the historic village of Civitella in the West.
[08:35:59] <imode> that'll be gone before I can even consider it.
[08:36:24] <manicennui> Seem to be a lot of things like this.
[08:36:30] <manicennui> Not sure why they are so cheap, relatively.
[08:36:39] <manicennui> Other than the fact that Europeans don't tend to make as much as we do.
[08:36:51] <imode> I mean, how far away from the basics like medical care, etc. is that.
[08:37:00] <bkero> not far
[08:37:02] <bkero> But
[08:37:07] <bkero> Kids don't want to live in the countryside
[08:37:15] <imode> I'd kill my brother to live in the countryside.
[08:37:15] <bkero> everyone wants to live in Palermo or Milan or other big cities
[08:37:23] <bkero> So the population in the countryside is decreasing *hard*
[08:37:26] <bkero> That's why shit is so cheap.
[08:37:33] <imode> ugh, please let this trend continue for 5 years.
[08:37:37] <imode> I'd love some property in italy.
[08:37:43] <bkero> Got $5k?
[08:37:50] <imode> yep.
[08:37:51] <bkero> Go be my neighbor in Sambuca
[08:38:08] <imode> got a property?
[08:38:21] <imode> also wait, _$5k?_
[08:38:34] <imode> the fuck does that buy, a quarter of an acre?
[08:38:35] <bkero> For that figure you need to be bidding on the 1 euro properties
[08:38:46] <manicennui> The what?
[08:39:22] <bkero> 1 euro properties
[08:39:29] <manicennui> There is also the problem of getting some kind of permanent visa.
[08:39:34] <bkero> Properties for sale with bidding starting at 1 euro, no reserves.
[08:39:43] <manicennui> bkero: Why are they so cheap?
[08:39:52] <bkero> https://europe.properties/case-e1-sambuca-sicily/
[08:40:02] <imode> that article is from 2019.
[08:40:07] <bkero> manicennui: The reason I mentioned before. Young people don't want to live in small towns or the countryside.
[08:40:11] <imode> ain't nothing available right now.
[08:40:27] <bkero> There are still plenty of Vende signs on houses around towna
[08:40:29] <bkero> town*
[08:40:50] <imode> yeah, call me in a year. a global pandemic is still happening and it's in fuckin' italy.
[08:41:14] <imode> I also still need to work. amazon might tolerate me moving interstate.
[08:41:26] <imode> it'll be interesting to see if I can work from _italy_.
[08:42:22] <bkero> You might be safer in Italy than Seattle.
[08:42:24] <manicennui> "Jeff! I needsa the reals spaghetti!"
[08:42:33] <imode> I imagine I would be.
[08:42:39] <imode> I don't live in seattle though.
[08:42:44] <bkero> You might be safer in Italy than the US.
[08:42:51] <imode> yeah, fair.
[08:43:06] <bkero> They have a red/yellow/green zone system for restricting movement
[08:43:06] <imode> tell that to my parents, who have a transitive dependency on their grandchildren to stay the fuck here until they die.
[08:43:09] <manicennui> Seems highly likely.
[08:43:21] <imode> which means I'm here. until they die.
[08:43:30] <imode> which probably won't be for another 20-30 years, god willing.
[08:43:40] <manicennui> Oh, you mean the pandemic.
[08:43:45] <manicennui> I thought you meant crime.
[08:43:53] <bkero> Crime heh
[08:44:05] <imode> I mean.
[08:44:06] <imode> mafia.
[08:44:19] <manicennui> I don't think the mafia kills randomly.
[08:44:29] <manicennui> Probably not going to be killed by stray gunfire.
[08:44:35] <manicennui> Or a mass shooting.
[08:45:13] <manicennui> Or right wing terorism.
[08:45:21] <bkero> You might be thinking of your mental model of Italy and not the actual reality of modern ITaly.
[08:45:22] <imode> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[08:45:33] <imode> don't people still idolize mussolini a bit.
[08:46:38] <imode> my mental model of italy is pizza pasta italiano mediterranean olive tomato sauce.
[08:46:45] <manicennui> The US's homicide rate is about 10x Italy's.
[08:47:14] <imode> ..italy is also a vastly smaller country.
[08:47:25] <imode> you'd be better off comparing it to the homicide rate in california.
[08:47:52] <manicennui> imode: That is per capita.
[08:47:59] <imode> ah.
[08:48:25] <manicennui> California's rate is pretty close to the overall average for the US.
[08:49:07] <manicennui> I'm sure you will be shocked to learn that the states with the highest rates are Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama.
[08:49:26] <imode> kinda unsurprising.
[08:49:35] <manicennui> First big blue state is IL at 12th.
[08:49:54] <imode> I didn't think there were that many people left in those states to kill.
[08:50:22] <manicennui> Not much else to do there.
[08:50:38] <manicennui> Either kill yourself with meth or kill someone else.
[09:01:40] <imode> I need some fucking hope in my life.
[09:04:15] * manicennui thinks
[09:07:38] <manicennui> Best I got is this smug cat: https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/sqam9l/princess_pamela_knocked_over_two_plants_all/
[09:07:40] <buttsbot> Princess Pamela knocked over two plants… all because I didn’t feed her the moment I came home from work. : cats
[09:10:16] <imode> I need my medication.
[09:11:46] <bkero> Italy's at 0.57 murders per 100k people
[09:12:15] <imode> I don't and can't live in fucking Italy.
[09:12:30] <imode> everywhere and everything is fucked.
[09:12:36] <manicennui> bkero: Yeah, and the US is at about 5.
[09:12:36] <imode> we should all just kill ourselves.
[09:12:45] <imode> or kill eachother and then kill ourselves.
[09:12:48] <bkero> That's probably a contributor
[09:12:49] <imode> fuck it just go commit mass murder.
[09:14:04] <manicennui> So Eminem apparently took a knee during the halftime show, so that will be a big scandal this week.

[17:48:43] <prussian> Sounds about right.
[17:50:58] <gwozniak> I'm content with my job, despite the problems.  I think I'm content because I see a willingness to fix things instead of just pumping out features, although that will become a bit more of an issue in the coming months with pressure from other teams I expect
[17:52:37] <Geekingfrog> It's the exact opposite here. Fixing the root causes of the problems is seen as a big delay on <next shiny new feature which will bring much moar £££>. So we have to constantly repeat the same workaround to unblock things, with very little hope to truly resolve the issue

[18:28:06] <gwozniak> I'll certainly be writing them
[18:29:34] <prussian> well, best of luck.
[18:30:04] <prussian> my concern is, the cops basically are still as softly corrupt insofar that they are basically politicized.
[18:30:20] <prussian> and i'm not sure what the implications of that going forward, has.
[18:31:07] <prussian> that's what really disturbed me about this trucking thing. I saw it sort of happening in Connecticut here with all the pushback against accountable policing.
[18:35:29] <gwozniak> It's very clear the police are biased in favour of white/right protestors at this point
[18:36:37] <gwozniak> It's surely a culture thing, and will take time to deal with
[18:39:24] <prussian> yeah. Wonder if I should start abusing it and put thin blue line and ccdl stickers in my back window
[18:40:14] <prussian> though with a CCDL sticker, a cop would probably approach my driver side window with his gun drawn. lol
[18:40:26] <companion_cube> people who go into the police to enforce order, get to be violent without repercussions, etc. tend to be proto fascists
[18:40:37] <companion_cube> ofc not all of the police are like that

[20:50:46] <manicennui> Tech bros could buy an entire block!
[20:51:42] <manicennui> I wonder what Internet access is like.
[20:52:02] <prussian> I can't wait for this to happen in the US
[20:52:03] <prussian> lmao
[20:52:16] <prussian> all the weird offshoot suburbs that aren't as cool anymore
[20:52:29] <manicennui> prussian: It already has.
[20:52:34] <manicennui> There are $1 lots in Chicago.
[20:52:36] <prussian> lmao
[20:52:42] <manicennui> But they mostly cell to people who live there.
[20:52:45] <manicennui> sell
[20:52:47] <manicennui> gah
[20:52:58] <manicennui> I think it might be a requirement that you own in the neighborhood.
[20:53:00] <prussian> i wonder what the property taxes are like on these random urban blight plots
[20:53:06] <manicennui> So rich assholes don't come in and buy it up.
[20:53:20] <manicennui> They did it so people would own and maintain lots where houses used to be.

[20:54:09] <prussian> If I was a wealthy property flipper, I'd probably try it out though. The Italy homes.
[20:54:18] <manicennui> "Applicants must own property on the same block; be current on property taxes; and have no financial obligations to the City, among other requirements."
[20:54:25] <prussian> lmao
[20:54:30] <prussian> sounds about right...
[20:54:57] <prussian> kubes already looks like a nightmare.
[20:54:58] <prussian> pray me
[20:55:05] <prussian> for* me
[20:55:07] <manicennui> You can also find houses for very little in the dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago.

[20:56:54] <prussian> interior checks out
[20:56:57] <prussian> lol
[20:57:29] <prussian> reminds me of all the housing near my university
[20:57:50] <prussian> literal straight out of the early 20th century
[20:58:20] <manicennui> A lot of Chicago buildings are from 100 years ago.
[20:58:32] <manicennui> Entire city was rebuilt after the fire.
[20:58:45] <manicennui> And with brick, so the buildings are still around.
[20:58:51] <manicennui> My building is just over 100 years old.
[20:59:04] <prussian> sounds about right

[22:25:17] <riv> gopher://tilde.team:70/0/~river/gopher-security
[22:25:45] <riv> that's funny :P
[22:26:23] <riv> I don't think there would be an easy way for the ISP to tell if you were doing gemini or just something else that's TLS encrypted
[22:26:55] <riv> you can assume it's gemini if it's on the gemini port, but that's just an assumption
[23:22:11] <gerikson> riv: yeah I know, but I wonder if the traffic "pattern" itself would give away gemini compared to say, email or SSH
[23:23:08] <edk> well, yes
[23:23:34] <gerikson> riv: gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/why-gopher-needs-crypto.txt
[23:23:42] <gerikson> OG reason
[23:24:16] <edk> imagine being able to click gopher links
[23:24:17] <edk> smdh
[23:24:23] <gerikson> I mean you won't get any *details* but it's easy enough to see "Gustaf visits this gemsite" <scan it> "it's about cats"
[23:24:30] <gerikson> edk: Lagrange client
[23:24:33] <gerikson> seriously
[23:24:39] <gerikson> good stuff
[23:24:49] <gerikson> TOO GOOD ACCORDING TO GEMINAUTS
[23:27:51] <gerikson> this made me lol, because on the MonoLisa page itself they compare directly to JetBrains Mono and the differences are... slight https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30337067

[23:30:14] <riv> just took two wireshark captures
[23:30:19] <riv> one i load lobsters one I load a gemini page
[23:30:27] <riv> no obvious differences
[23:30:52] <riv> you could probe the ip addresses to see what they serve, but from passively sniffing traffic it's hard to tell them apart
[23:31:04] <gerikson> ok thanks riv
[23:31:07] <gerikson> gonna strike that
[23:31:40] <gerikson> that means that last sentence won't make it... it was kind of the stinger
[23:31:43] <gerikson> maybe too mean
[23:31:49] <riv> the punchline was good enough that it's worth keeping in, even if it's a stretch to think ISPs could fingerprint it
[23:32:13] <riv> although they can trivially via the port right?
[23:41:07] <gerikson> yeah
