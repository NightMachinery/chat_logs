[06:29:13] <CoJaBo> (I haven't ruled out something about the 8.0 installation itself being effed up, but we don't need to support 8.0 anyway, so I'm not gonna bother lol)

[19:09:29] <TernaryOperator> there are some sites that are worth keeping an eye on as well, phptherightway is greater and stitcher.io does a great job of condensing down whats happening/coming to the language soon
[19:10:00] <TernaryOperator> Jetbrains (phpstorm/intellij maker) put out PHP Annotated Monthly which is well worth subscribing to (free) for a more general "whats new and cool in the PHP world"
[19:11:18] <TernaryOperator> https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/category/php-annotated-monthly/ and https://phptherightway.com/ and https://stitcher.io/

[19:28:56] <gde33> trying to read this   $bar = mysql_query("SELECT Count(*) as total FROM foo", $db);  which seems to count rows?    But the next line is    $baz   = mysql_fetch_array($bar);    what is going on?
[19:29:20] <__adrian> gde33: don't use/learn from this code
[19:29:30] <__adrian> ext/mysql is long deprecated and removed.
[19:29:31] <gde33> just curious
[19:29:44] <__adrian> it's fetching the result
[19:30:22] <gde33> all rows?
[19:30:34] <TinoDidriksen> mysql_query() doesn't return the count - it just returns a result set handle. Then that handle is used to fetch the actual count result.
[19:30:44] <gde33> ahhh
[19:30:50] <__adrian> you can check the man page
[19:30:55] <__adrian> but no, one row.
[19:31:41] *** Joins: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy)
[19:31:45] <gde33> today we do this with num_rows simply?
[19:31:54] <__adrian> ...?  geez no
[19:32:00] <__adrian> count them
[19:32:39] <__adrian> the query would be the same. you'd be using PDO (or maybe mysqli) instead, though.
[19:33:19] <gde33> ah I see
[19:33:37] <robertparkerx> Thanks AnrDaemon
[19:34:49] <__adrian> though, seeing as there's only one row with one column, https://php.net/pdostatement.fetchcolumn
[19:36:29] <__adrian> e.g., $count = $pdo->query("select count(*) from foo")->fetchColumn();
[19:36:32] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[19:36:47] <__adrian> hi

[19:54:27] <gde33> I'm "fixing" phpbb 1.4.4 for uhh therapeutic purposes

[21:25:07] <AnrDaemon> LOL. Why not just upgrade to 2 then 3?
[21:34:29] <gde33> AnrDaemon: those don't have the icons for icq aim and yahoo messenger?
[21:36:59] <gde33> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/PhpBB1-defaultinst.png
[21:41:00] <TinoDidriksen> Those services are dead.

[22:03:42] <AnrDaemon> YM is dead, ICQ is largely out of business as well. The day they decided to cleanup "unused" accounts turned away a lot of people.
[22:04:29] <AnrDaemon> Besides, this is all mods and I can for sure say that at least for v2 these icons are (were) available at the time.
[22:06:02] <AnrDaemon> You just have to choose, what is more important for your community: continuity of your conversations or a few questionable features.
[22:06:17] <gde33> AnrDaemon: lots of people used the old boards, I can see the geezers gather around the dark theme n marvel about the good old days
[22:06:39] <AnrDaemon> I've already seen forums drop in popularity the moment their administration decided to switch engines.
[22:06:49] <gde33> AnrDaemon: right
[22:07:26] <gde33> AnrDaemon: I'm not even sure what modern versions of phpbb [can] look like
[22:07:51] <gde33> AnrDaemon: the first version is already rich in what I would call useless information
[22:07:53] <AnrDaemon> It can look like anything :) Just go to phpdd.com and peruse themes library.
[22:08:39] <gde33> AnrDaemon: every time someone loads a page it counts the number of forums, categories, postings, total users and users online
[22:09:12] <gde33> AnrDaemon: better pray you never all of a sudden get real traffic
[22:10:09] <AnrDaemon> :) The more reasons to upgrade.
[22:11:31] <gde33> there is some process in the bakc of my head building a forum in xhtml that appends the new postings to the end of the file and sorts them to the top with css grid :P
[22:13:50] <TernaryOperator> go full horror show, use contenteditable :D
[22:14:22] <gde33> TernaryOperator: with live updates?
[22:14:45] <gde33> give everyone a cursor and a pointer
[22:17:21] <gde33> TernaryOperator: phpbb 1.4.4 has support for html, such great idea! Why not add support for php too?
