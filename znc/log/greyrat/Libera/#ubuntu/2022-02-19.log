[00:40:53] <adderall> This is true.
[00:40:57] <adderall> You learn about computer science.
[00:41:16] <adderall> It would be the best if my interviewers didn't keep asking me PowerShell and Windows questions though.

[00:41:51] <coz_> adderall, i have ot
[00:41:53] <coz_> not
[00:42:54] <adderall> Try it. It's interesting. I've found that the Linux anti-malware or anti-rootkit programs are a lot more thorough than Windows stuff. It will flag a lot of stuff that consists of false positives for most people but you'll learn about what something should look for auditing in a production environment.

[04:09:46] <ninjarockstarjsd> Hello friends. I'm trying to setup disk encryption on an external drive that I want auto-mounted on system start.
[04:09:46] <ninjarockstarjsd> The main computer drive is already encrypted with LUKS and requires a password to start up. Is what I'm trying to do possible to do securely?
[04:10:45] <ninjarockstarjsd> I found this answer on SO, but one of the comment said it isn't secure at all. https://askubuntu.com/a/709653   is that true?

[04:15:55] <oerheks> automount without password input is not secure, indeed.
[04:16:27] <sarnold> but using the same password for two devices is probably possible
[04:16:54] <ninjarockstarjsd> Is it possible to enter it only once and have both unlocked?

[04:19:32] <oerheks> on startup is a bad idea, and hard to do.
[04:19:44] <ninjarockstarjsd> I'm setting up a home media/nas server as a general storage for all my stuff
[04:19:56] <oerheks> and why, you cannot access it while booting.
[04:20:13] <oerheks> it does not save you time either.
[04:20:45] <EriC^^> ninjarockstarjsd: if someone steals the main os, he'd need the pass to decrypt it and further decrypt the ext hdd, so its safe i guess to just put the password of the ext hdd inside it to automount it
[04:21:10] <EriC^^> is security would be hinged on the main os's pass
[04:21:13] <EriC^^> *its
[04:21:55] <ninjarockstarjsd> The reason why I wanted to mount it at boot is because I'm setting up my various media server stuff as service and start at boot. And they'd need access to the external drive

[04:32:29] <ninjarockstarjsd> I can test it out real quick
[04:34:37] <EriC^^> one very edge case advantage to using the initial password to decrypt both would be if they somehow thought to see the ext hdd password before stealing/turning off the pc
[04:35:39] <EriC^^> or someone you know did that before stealing, who usually has access to the pc and knows its encrypted

[06:12:09] <PCBuilder> Somewhat odd question, but was there an ongoing troll raid going on recently? I help run a large-ish SubReddit and Discord and received a very angry report that someone was spamming using our custom URL and wanted to check things out and talk to any OPs about helping with the situation (as the same troll or troll group is targeting us as well but
[06:12:10] <PCBuilder> seems to have started switching to targeting others and attaching our URL to the posts). And the person who contact me claimed there was an active raid - but things seem quiet so they might have been lying.

[06:19:37] <oerheks> donnie, what windows share? samba?
[06:19:45] <sarnold> donnie: smbclient on the command line, mount cifs via the kernel, and both kde and gnome have things built into their "virtualized filesystem" framework things, so using their explorer.exe clones or their applications would work easy enough

[07:53:44] <rm-rf> Trolling isn't what it used to be. It used to be little more than little pranks. Now it's devolved into criminal shit.

[07:54:36] <oerheks> anyway,  rm -rf /  does not work on ubuntu
[07:54:41] <ninjarockstarjsd> I got a dumb question.    /etc/fstab wants a UUID=XXXYYYZZ,   but my drive is   in /dev/mapper/...     how do I format that for /etc/fstab?
[07:54:41] <ninjarockstarjsd> I tried replacing the UUID=...   with the /dev/mapper/... path, but it doesn't get mounted
[07:54:50] <rm-rf> Well, no, it doesn't work without a warning. Correct
[07:55:26] <rm-rf> But you could set your system up to ignore those warnings. Thing is, if you know how to manually bypass warnings or eradicate them, you are probabbly wise enough to not run rm -rf / in the first place.

[08:00:29] <ninjarockstarjsd> Gentlemen, I've done it. I've mastered Linux. I can now book with an encrypted external drive
[08:00:57] <spammy> awesome
[08:03:27] <carnophage2> congrats
[08:03:43] <carnophage2> how did you do it?
[08:04:02] <ninjarockstarjsd> with sweat and tears
[08:04:31] <carnophage2> encrypt the os with dm-crypt or whatever, then have it set up to decrypt it once that's open?
[08:04:53] <carnophage2> either way, way to go.  when you finally get over the frustration, comprehension is like mmmm that's the stuff.
[08:05:02] <ninjarockstarjsd> Since I have a main drive which uses LUKS and and external one also and they both use the same encryption password, I used this method to only input password once:
[08:05:03] <ninjarockstarjsd> https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/392286
[08:05:52] <ninjarockstarjsd> Then I had to figure out where the unencrypted drive actually lives so I can mount it somewhere useful for use. This took forever, because I wasn't sure why it wasn't mounting

[09:39:22] <rfm> ninjarockstarjsd, I have had no problem with NFS for many decades; How are you mounting the remote fs?  If it's via the nautilus gui it might be going thru some gvfs/fuse thing; real kernel nfs via mount (or /etc/fstab) might work better
[09:41:52] <ninjarockstarjsd> I'm mounting with just the mount command
[09:43:14] <ninjarockstarjsd> I disabled network on my NFS server for a second, and my nautilus on my nfs client computer became very unstable and crashed. Even after restarting, I wasn't able to open it up again because I had a mount in my home dir

[09:45:01] <rfm> ninjarockstarjsd, certainly if you have your home dir on nfs and stop the server it will be bad (we used to run that way at Sun)

[09:49:41] <alkisg> A hard mount would mean that you would be able to restart your nfs server, and the client (e.g. nautilus) would continue writing the file from where it left off. Sometimes that's desired, e.g. for rootfs and /home, sometimes not

[18:44:14] <Alex948> I want to make the switch from Windows 10 to Ubuntu Desktop 20.04.3-amd64 as a daily driver. I need my entire drive to be encrypted, including the home, boot, tmp and swap directories. I want to make so that if my device / hard drive was to be stolen, they would not be able to read any data without entering the passwords at boot time. Even if they
[18:44:14] <Alex948> removed the hard drive, it should resist being attacked from outside programs. I followed the guide on the official Ubuntu docs to achieve this ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019 ). Unfortunately, I don't trust my own skills enough, so I'd love to have a quick sanity check. Can anybody tell me if I have achieved my
[18:44:15] <Alex948> goal or if I missed something? With this setup, can I be 100% sure that ANY data written ANYWHERE will be encrypted by LUKS, no matter if its personal files, RAM written to swap, hibernation images and temporary files? Logs: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/92baedfb

After that, Ubuntu can start and it asks me to unlock the main sda5 drive. But then I get another prompt by Ubuntu also asking me to unlock the /x2fboot (LUKS_BOOT) drive. Why is that necessary?

[19:02:52] <leftyfb> Alex948: I'm not sure why you encrypted /boot. That's probably part of the problem. You do not need to encrypt your /boot and when you do it probably causes LUKS/installer to create the LUKS boot so you have a way to boot in order to decrypt the rest of the OS
[19:02:58] <Alex948> leftyfb: It was a deliberate decision to have /boot encrypted with a one password and the rest of the data (including swap) with a different password, so it doesn't surprise me that I have to enter multiple passwords. But I would have assumed that /boot is for GRUB (first password) and the rest of Ubuntu only needs the main data drive (second
[19:02:58] <Alex948> password)
[19:03:18] <Alex948> I was under the assumption that encrypting /boot would provide more security because the kernel cannot be tempered with
[19:04:13] <Alex948> (evil maid attack)
[19:04:27] <tomreyn> not while the crypto container is not opened, right

[19:05:50] <Alex948> alkisg: Ah okay, I didn't know Ubuntu needs to actively read/write /boot, I though that only for some kind of loader and from there on the rest of the data will be on the other drive

[19:07:43] <EriC^^> Alex948: you can add /boot into the main encrypted fs, and not use a plaintext /boot partition
[19:08:11] <EriC^^> you just need to add a variable to /etc/default/grub after moving the stuff to "/boot" (in the main fs)
[19:08:23] <EriC^^> then you only need one password
[19:08:26] <tomreyn> Alex948: note that the efi system partition, if you're uefi booting, will still have to be unencrypted, though.
[19:08:59] <tomreyn> also the efi parameter / variable store
[19:09:34] <EriC^^> Alex948: "GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y" in /etc/default/grub then 'sudo update-grub'
[19:09:41] <Alex948> The problem is that I actually cannot use a very secure password in the GRUB prompt. This is because the GRUB prompt only works with US keyboard layouts and the layout of my keyboard is different. So I cannot enter my really strong password there. When Ubuntu boots up and shows its prompt it actually remembers my locale default keymap so I can
[19:09:42] <Alex948> enter all kinds of characters correctly. So the GRUB /boot password is a relatively simple one, just to prevent other people from tinkering with the /boot
[19:09:50] <donnie> leftyfb: so wine is my only option then? or a different computer for that. lol

[23:00:04] <Maik> frost-core: and again it doesn't seem to be a ubuntu related question
[23:00:31] <frost-core> but, i just wanna know about how to move a partition
[23:00:33] <KBar> goodfella: it's a proprietary software that's not even in the repositories?
[23:00:34] <goodfella> the latest LTS
[23:00:44] <jhutchins> frost-core: "top" doesn't actually mean anything in this context.  You can probably make it _do_ what you have in mind though.

[23:43:46] <Chunkyz> last question, if my ISP says my speed is 1gbps, and my ethenet controller/cable is 1gbps... what sort of download speed should I expect? using Ubuntu 21.10
[23:44:36] <jhutchins> Chunkyz: It depends on hardware.  Spinning disks won't usually do 1G, but a system with an SSD should get 800-900 Mb/Sec.
[23:44:37] <oerheks> 1 gbps is raw, with overhead..
[23:44:52] <oerheks> so, your actual speed is something less than that
[23:44:59] <jhutchins> Google will hit 900+.
[23:45:03] <Chunkyz> using an SSD.
[23:45:20] <jhutchins> Chunkyz: speedtest-cli
[23:45:24] <oerheks> ssd has nothing to do with that
[23:45:34] <Chunkyz> thanks, I'm getting more or less expected speed then. :-)
[23:46:10] <Chunkyz> jhutchins, that's not very accurate though. thanks though. :-)
[23:46:37] <jhutchins> oerheks: I can demonstrate a difference in speedtest results for an SSD vs. a spinning rust drive, about 300Mb/Sec.

[23:47:39] <oerheks> jhutchins, that is new to me, what does storage have to do with internet speed?
[23:48:29] <jhutchins> oerheks: Assuming that the test is passing more data than the RAM cache can hold, it apparently causes a lag when writing to the disk.
[23:48:32] <Chunkyz> jhutchins, yeah it's always been bad here.
[23:48:54] <jhutchins> Chunkyz: Who's your provider?
[23:49:00] <Chunkyz> virgin media, UK.
[23:49:27] <jhutchins> If they're like Google, they won't guarantee minimum performance.
[23:49:51] <Chunkyz> they do, they say 500mbps is the minimum I should get. I get around 900mbps give or take.
[23:50:09] <Chunkyz> I know it's correct now :-)
[23:50:15] <jhutchins> oerheks: At 1G speeds, older hardware can be a factor.
[23:50:42] <jhutchins> Chunkyz: That's really very good performance in the real world.
[23:50:53] <oerheks> meh, doubtfull that a ssd infuences speed of a gigabit adapter speed
[23:51:19] <jhutchins> Chunkyz: At that speed, your sources will be the limiting factor (ie. Ubuntu mirror servers).
