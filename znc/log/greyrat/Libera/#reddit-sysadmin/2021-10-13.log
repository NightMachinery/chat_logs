[03:31:50] <hirogen> yeah 3 months cache i think 
[03:31:51] <xe0n> if you get that when using cache mode it means the disk is working
[03:32:01] <hirogen> ok
[03:32:03] <xe0n> 3 months...err i'd extend that to 12 months
[03:32:11] <xe0n> if htey're going back 3 months then the no response is it loading from exchange online
[03:32:17] <xe0n> or whatever their mail is
[03:32:28] <hirogen> yeah for sure I'll confirm it later when at work

[03:39:14] <xe0n> sure, so thats standard stuff for exchange online
[03:39:18] <xe0n> set the cache size to 12 months minimum
[03:39:32] <xe0n> else when they look for a message thats 12 weeks or older it's going out to the internet

[13:22:12] <EnchanterTim> Ever used Oracle Free Compute stuff vps?
[13:22:22] <EnchanterTim> I'm trying to setup one free one you sign up for
[13:22:43] <EnchanterTim> https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/bootvolumes.htm I'm not understanding this boot volume option.
[13:23:50] <EnchanterTim> Hmm. I wonder. I have not seen this thing on other vps providers. 
[13:24:02] <EnchanterTim> The whole deatch/attach things
[13:24:24] <EnchanterTim> When you launch a virtual machine (VM) or bare metal instance based on a platform image or custom image, a new boot volume for the instance is created in the same compartment. That boot volume is associated with that instance until you terminate the instance. When you terminate the instance, you can preserve the boot volume and its data.

[18:49:02] <A-KO|pc> it's 8-bit with dithering for the HDR stuff

[18:52:34] <A-KO> oh yeah, my monitor doesn't support DSC--which is a tech being used to squeeze more bandwidth out of DisplayPort
[18:52:39] <A-KO> because I guess 2.0 isn't ready?
[18:52:56] <technonerd_> its only 3k
[18:53:05] <A-KO> however, DSC support is needed on both sides. And I think you need a 30 series graphics card for that feature
[18:53:22] <A-KO> yeah, 'only' 3K
[18:53:27] <A-KO> I dropped 2000 on its baby brother
[18:53:39] <A-KO> I'm not ready to plop down 3000 on the bigger one
[18:53:40] <A-KO> lol
[18:53:43] <A-KO> I'm fine for now
[18:53:48] <ender> DSC was added in DP 1.3
[18:54:01] <A-KO> yeah, but I don't think Nvidia had it until 30 series
[18:54:06] <A-KO> pretty sure 20 series doesn't do DSC
[18:54:10] <ender> oh
[18:54:33] <technonerd_> would be nice to ditch the 2nd 60hz i have, get double 144hz
[18:54:34] <A-KO> oh, maybe turing can do it
[18:54:49] <A-KO> yep. the 20 series can
[18:54:50] <ender> I wouldn't know. My 5k's don't need it (and DP1.4 has enough bandwidth for 5k@60Hz without DSC, so the DP hub works fine)
[18:54:51] <A-KO> 10 cannot
[18:55:14] <A-KO> so my Asus PG27UQ doesn't support DSC then
[18:56:28] <A-KO> still a good monitor, I just can't power 120Hz at 10-bit
[18:56:32] <A-KO> which makes me a sad panda
[18:56:39] <A-KO> I can do some off refresh stuff like 98Hz
[18:56:40] <A-KO> lol
[18:56:51] <A-KO> but since 95% of the content I use on the monitor is 8-bit anyway
[18:56:57] <A-KO> 10-bit seems like a waste compared to the 120Hz
