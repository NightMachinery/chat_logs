[17:39:20] <mishugana> hello folks, beginner here, have a question about upping my Haskell game.
[17:39:57] <mishugana> So I've finished Graham Hutton's "Programming in Haskell" (2nd Edition), which was great. Given that, how would you recommend I progress from here?
[17:40:23] <mishugana> My main aim is not research but general-purpose programming as well as a special interest in compilers, if that helps
[17:41:12] <mishugana> For reference, after finishing the book, I took a look at the HaskellWiki page for Monad Transformers, but was sorely disappointed that I couldn't make it past halfway through.

[18:34:18] <Christoph[m]> Is the syntax of this chatroom (and the bots in it?) documented somewhere? For example, how can I enter code? (And why is code often displayed wrong? Is the highlighting done by the chat client and they didn't agree on a common syntax?)
[18:39:42] <merijn> Eh, IRC doesn't have a syntax
[18:40:20] <merijn> clients may decide to do some kinda formatting based on common styles of writing, but IRC itself is just plain text

[23:19:45] <segfaultfizzbuzz> i'm taking another one of my periodic stabs at haskell today. i regularly run into warts which lead me to quit entirely. this time, i'm following some tutorial which is trying to define a division operator which returns a Maybe
[23:20:26] <segfaultfizzbuzz> the problem i am running into is that it wants to use `div` to perform division when the division is not by zero, but if i say 3 `div` 4 in ghci, i get... zero??
[23:21:33] <segfaultfizzbuzz> and 3 / 4 doesn't seem to work when i try to use it as a return value in the function definition, see here: https://paste.rs/X6k.hs
[23:22:46] <perryprog> Well, you're doing /integer/ division, which means everything will be whole numbers
[23:23:33] <perryprog> If you remember all the way back to long division, you'd normally get a whole number quotient and a whole number remainder—integer division is just the whole number quotient
[23:24:09] <perryprog> It's also the same as floor(3/4) in simpler terms
[23:24:10] <segfaultfizzbuzz> oh. right.
[23:24:59] <segfaultfizzbuzz> does ghci have an autoload feature?
[23:25:23] <awpr> using `div` there does work; I just typed it into ghci.
[23:25:33] <segfaultfizzbuzz> yeah, you're right, i'm just... tired today.
[23:25:52] <awpr> (maybe there were missing backquotes the first time you tried it?)
[23:26:02] <segfaultfizzbuzz> no i just... somehow didn't think about the output type being constrained
