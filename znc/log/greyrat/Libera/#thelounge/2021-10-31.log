[07:00:39] <johncs> Koragg: yes, that's one way to do it. Low ports require root priveliges to access.
[07:01:29] <Koragg> isn't it a security risk to run especially IRC services as root? and ty for confirming that is the necessary step and it was not that oidentd or thelounge was improperly configured by me
[07:02:51] <johncs> You can setup something else to forward data to thelounge. Here's a guide for one way of doing so: https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/identd-and-oidentd#using-oidentd-to-forward-requests-to-the-built-in-server
[07:03:28] <johncs> Using nginx as a reverse proxy might work (it can reverse proxy tcp), or iptables itself can be used for this, forwarding traffic from one port to another.
[07:03:40] <johncs> These options allow you to not run thelounge as root

[07:54:55] <Koragg> I did notice a bug I believe: as I noticed that thelounge keeps overriding my ~/.oidentd.conf I instead properly created and pointed thelounge at ~/.loungeoidentd . bug: it only uses the ident from ~/.oidentd.conf regardless
[07:55:19] <Koragg> is it a reported issue that if using a diff file for oidentd settings that it still uses just the default one in the home dir?
[07:56:21] <Koragg> I even setup a special "to" in ~/.oidentd.conf for one network, and using another client, it takes that custom ident, but thelounge uses the global reply in ~/.oidentd.conf even though I fed it ~/.loungeoidentd.conf
[07:56:47] <Koragg> I hope I at least properly formulated the issue with that ^

In the (least) recommended mode of the three it can output a file that's understood by oidentd, but the reply isn't from TL then
[12:12:22] <bookworm> The options are 1) oidentd proxies to TL internal ident (recommended). 2) internal TL ident only, no oident at all (not recommend as it needs root). 3) TL generates oidentd config, oidentd reads said config. No internal TL ident used (not recommend, historical compatibility)

[12:54:36] <janis> I can only comment that option 1 works just fine. Didn't end up using it, but played around with it yesterday.
[12:54:37] <janis> Enable identd server (not oidentd) in tl config with something like port 9001 and configure oidentd to proxy requests to it.
[12:55:53] <janis> As for forwarding request via nginx reverse proxy or iptables - somehow i didnt manage to get it working. But it probably should also be possible.
[12:56:55] <bookworm> s/probably should/is/
[12:57:33] <bookworm> anything you can do transparently works, as TL wouldn't even be aware of it
[12:58:14] <bookworm> it gets a connection, it replies. That's all there is to it. How the routing works and what tunnels you put in between is someone else's problem
[12:58:48] <bookworm> that's the beauty of the network stack ;)
[13:01:23] <janis> Yep.
[13:01:45] <janis> Didn't mean to imply that it was TL problem.
[13:04:53] <janis> On a related note - as far as irc goes - is identd even relevant these days?
[13:05:12] <bookworm> not really no. The whole ident model is flawed
[13:05:31] <bookworm> it assumes that a user has no control over the host, which nowdays is pretty much always not true
[13:06:39] *** Joins: denningsrogue9 (~denningsr@206.214.235.175)
[13:06:40] <bookworm> the only thing it does is say "the ident is corresponding to the policy of the remote admin"
[13:07:24] <bookworm> it can be useful if you have a known bouncer, where users don't actually control the host... but how widespread are they really?
[13:08:22] <bookworm> if if you actually reach a size where this would matter, you're over the connection limit of most networks anyhow and they'll have to be whitelisted. At which they might just give them a proper network mask of a gatway

[13:53:06] <janis> on a slightly different note - is it possible to use wildcards in / ignore in TL?
[13:53:06] <janis> say ignore Guest*!*@*
[13:53:06] <janis> or *!~guest*@*
[13:53:41] <janis> it somehow only works with exact nick or userid

[13:58:14] <bookworm> oh, you want to match by prefix? So ignore everything starting with guest?
[13:58:45] <bookworm> No, that isn't how it works. The only wildcard allowed is literally '*', meaning everything at that particular location (nick, ident, host)
[14:01:35] <janis> yeah, matching prefix
[14:01:36] <janis> right
[14:02:57] <janis> is it just the lougne thing?
[14:02:57] <janis> havent dealt with irc in a long time, sorry.
[14:08:21] <bookworm> TL bug I think
[14:13:16] <bookworm> definitely a TL bug
