[09:38:45] <Abhi[m]> > wanna give more information?
[09:38:45] <Abhi[m]> iit bad.
[09:38:53] <Abhi[m]> I donâ€™t like iit .
[09:42:41] <iamak[m]> <smud[m]> "Distros aren't minimal or..." <- I mean Manjaro = Arch + stuff so :p
[09:43:01] <iamak[m]> You could install Manjaro, remove all the non Arch stuff but I think that would be more tedious
[09:43:12] <iamak[m]> Arch + WM if he's comfortable will be lighter than Manjaro
[10:19:10] <dakship[m]> <Abhi[m]> "> <Neo Void> hmm interesting......" <- why
[10:47:51] <NeoVoid[m]> <Abhi[m]> "I donâ€™t like iit ." <- what about NITs?
[10:48:16] <Abhi[m]> Sucks
[10:48:56] <Abhi[m]> I should gather my thoughts , but iitbad.com and post it on their .
[10:48:57] <Abhi[m]> Lol
[10:54:00] <NeoVoid[m]> <Abhi[m]> "I should gather my thoughts..." <- not a real site
[10:54:27] <NeoVoid[m]> <Abhi[m]> "I should gather my thoughts..." <- or you can make a blog about it in your website
[10:54:38] <Abhi[m]> Buy *
[10:56:43] <NeoVoid[m]> buy fast then before anyone takes it.
[10:57:03] <Abhi[m]> NeoVoid[m]: The domain name is expiring the renewal fees is 1299, on the godaddy they offering dot com domain for 249 if i register for 2 year that is total â‚¹1,298.00
[10:57:46] <Abhi[m]> So it its cheaper for me to get 2 year and a dot com then to renew my current one
[10:58:02] <AryaK[m]> 669 per year on namecheap
[10:58:17] <AryaK[m]> nvm thats for iitbad
[10:58:44] <Abhi[m]> but i don't have the payment option they need
[10:58:51] <Abhi[m]> i can't use namecheap sadly
[10:59:48] <AryaK[m]> oof
[10:59:58] <AryaK[m]> porkbun.com?
[11:00:10] <Abhi[m]> You can ? you have international payments ?
[11:01:05] <AryaK[m]> wait namecheap doesn t require internationalpayments does it
[11:01:14] <Abhi[m]> It does
[11:01:19] <AryaK[m]> i think its free to enable int payments
[11:01:24] <AryaK[m]> i am not sure
[11:01:34] <AryaK[m]> i havent bought a domain yet
[11:01:38] <Abhi[m]> But i don't want to for a domain .
[11:01:39] <AryaK[m]> will know soon :P
[11:01:46] <AryaK[m]> Abhi[m]: ohhh
[11:02:08] <Abhi[m]> And it's cheaper for 2 year on go dady anyways i ahve about 30 days to make the decision
[11:41:38] <NeoVoid[m]> <Abhi[m]> "but i don't have the payment..." <- welcome to the club

[11:44:39] <ramram[m]> <Abhi[m]> "And it's cheaper for 2 year on..." <- is godaddy the best option we have here ?
[11:47:31] <Abhi[m]> ramram[m]: It's the popular and convinent one for sure
[11:55:13] <NeoVoid[m]> <Abhi[m]> "It's the popular and convinent..." <- landchad.com says otherwiser

[11:57:38] <NeoVoid[m]> Here are some registrars to explicitly avoid:
[11:57:38] <NeoVoid[m]> GoDaddy â€“ People always want to go here because it's so well advertized. They have a long record of censorship and nickeling-and-diming accounts. Just avoid them. They can be lazy because a lot of people use them because they are often the "default" registrar.NearlyFreeSpeech â€“ People have signed up for this minor registrar because of its name that's actually tongue-and-cheek. I will letÂ this post of theirsÂ speak for itself.
[11:57:38] <NeoVoid[m]> Register a domain here only if you want to have it seized.Google, Amazon â€“ Maybe this is obvious, but if you are trying to escape the control of Google or Amazon, it is a very self-defeating thing to register your domain with them. Sites like Parler figured this out the hard way.
[11:57:38] <NeoVoid[m]> If you use one of these registrars, be sure to remove your domains from it ASAP. That is usually a very easy thing to do, although you can only move a domain to a new registrar once every several months. Pick a good one and stay put. Registrars without principled policies maintain the right to seize your domain name on their whim. Don't think for a minute that this doesn't apply to you.
[12:28:31] <Abhi[m]> Tell me what to use then
[12:28:38] <Abhi[m]> I know this btw
[12:28:50] <Abhi[m]> What are the other valid option's i have ?
[12:38:11] <smud[m]> Which payment option works for you?
[12:45:02] <Abhi[m]> Upi or net banking or card
[12:45:10] <Abhi[m]> * banking or domestic card
[12:45:27] <Abhi[m]> Ps - I it should be cheap .
[12:59:30] <smud[m]> Hmm, maybe bigrock
[13:00:53] <Abhi[m]> Expensive

[14:50:57] <Zbnssn[m]> Abhi[m]: yeah would be moronic to buy domain for your libre site from them... they literally sell ur email details and ur inbox is filled w constant spam
[14:53:13] <Zbnssn[m]> <Abhi[m]> "I donâ€™t have international" <- even I didnt ask ur dad or some friend to hook it up for you and repay them thru upi
[14:53:21] <sla[m]12> <Abhi[m]> "Tell me a good alternative sir..." <- refer to landchad.net
