[05:10:13] <fossforus> Hi, I'm trying to bind alt-shift-, and alt-shift-. to scroll-to-perc 0 and 100 respectively; but nothing I try seems to work (no console message or anything), or refuses to start
[05:11:32] <fossforus> using the key debugger gives me the string <alt-shift->> and <alt-shift-<>, but putting these in my config.py just results in qutebrowser refusing to start
[05:11:48] <fossforus> escaping the < and > also doesn't work, console just returns invalid escape \> and \<
[05:14:07] <fossforus> config line looks like this: c.bindings.commands['normal'] = { '<alt-shift-,>': 'scroll-to-perc 0', '<alt-shift-.>': 'scroll-to-perc', ... }

[12:06:52] <The-Compiler> Neko-nyaaan: IIRC the autoplay setting is mostly about <video> elements played by the browser itself rather than things like YouTube - but all qutebrowser does is passing it to the underlying Chromium
