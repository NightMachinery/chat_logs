[00:03:24] <JimBuntu> Correct, when powering off correctly it doesn't get set
[00:03:54] <JimBuntu> You are right on the money jan6 , it's a financial cost AND it messes up the analytics
[00:04:53] <JimBuntu> Last I knew, it was starting to become just about losing track while in a call.  I'm about 10 years out of date on these things though.

[02:32:45] <Joanna> Corbett report one
[02:35:27] <Joanna> For those that don’t know there is a section of military dedicated to psychological operations whose job it is to demoralize, confuse, scare or manipulate enemy troops using loudspeakers leaflets etc.
[02:37:54] <Joanna> The do all sorts of things like telling them that their wives are sleeping with other men while they are away . Or hey if you surrender you will be treated well. Or save yourself with a a picture of a guy running away from exploding tank.
[02:40:42] <Joanna> Sometimes they just broadcast annoying sounds like crying babies or other things to keep them from sleeping

[02:46:46] <Joanna> As all things that military does, psychological operations are a support function for killing and defeating enemies. The fact that the military is willing to attack with psychological warfare is really bad news for citizens because it means that the military is willing to come kill them with weapons because they are the enemy target...

[04:39:09] <B4ckBOne> Thats a big jump lol
[04:40:11] <Joanna> Well killing and robbing large numbers of people is a history fact :)
[04:40:34] <B4ckBOne> Do you have any facts?
[04:41:14] <Joanna> I recommend the Corbett podcast in topic it is very good.
[04:44:30] <B4ckBOne> Been nice talking to you in the past Joanna 
[04:44:50] <B4ckBOne> However this is something i wont engage in. 
[04:44:56] <B4ckBOne> Have fun :)
[04:46:30] <Joanna> jessicara: what kind of issues did you have?
[04:47:01] <jessicara> chest pain, heart racing, was too weak to get out of bed for like 2 days
[04:47:16] <jessicara> even now i can still feel the weakness a bit
[04:47:55] <Joanna> How many have you had?
[04:48:16] <jessicara> 3
[04:48:24] <jessicara> this happened on the first and 3rd interestingly
[04:48:27] <jessicara> not on the 2nd
[04:49:01] <Joanna> Will you have more boosters when they come out ?
[04:49:04] <jessicara> same with the headache, ridiculous headache which was a lot worse when move
[04:49:11] <jessicara> yeah, fairly sure i'll have to
[04:49:40] <Joanna> Where there is pain there is damage.
[04:49:50] <jessicara> sometimes
[04:50:11] <jessicara> won't know what went wrong unless properly test
[04:50:20] <Joanna> Some damage is repairable some isn’t.
[04:50:56] <Joanna> Why did you feel you had to get them?
[04:51:06] <jessicara> not so much feel as not in a position to really refuse them
[04:52:03] <Joanna> Well if it was to keep your job your employer will dump you as soon as your health fails.
[04:53:00] <jessicara> is quite a different situation
[04:53:22] <jessicara> as for other people know who refused the vaccine, they are also dumped for not being vaccinated
[04:54:06] <Joanna> But they still have their health:)
[04:54:15] <jessicara> maybe, will see
[04:54:27] <jessicara> i seem to have got it all in an unlucky order
[04:54:35] <jessicara> i got covid twice before the first vaccine was available
[04:54:59] <jessicara> can say the vaccine was not as bad as covid for me in my case
[04:55:05] <Joanna> So it was not necessary
[04:55:20] <Joanna> What happened with the Covid?
[04:55:34] <Joanna> How long were you sick?
[04:55:50] <jessicara> about 2 weeks with covid
[04:56:06] <jessicara> it was similar except for the struggle to breathe and the pain in the lungs
[04:56:14] <Joanna> Are you sure it wasn’t influenza?
[04:56:19] <jessicara> yeah i'm sure
[04:56:24] <jessicara> it was strangely exactly the same twice
[04:56:28] <Joanna> Or pneumonia?
[04:56:31] <jessicara> never had this again since the vaccine
[04:57:18] <Joanna> Did you cough up a lot of stuff?
[04:57:25] <jessicara> is other breathing issues too, although yet again healthcare kinda sucks, so no idea what's up with my lungs since i was a kid even
[04:57:34] <jessicara> at the end of it both times i did
[04:57:57] <jessicara> i normally cough up stuff, but that actually turned in to a dry cough at the start of covid
[04:58:02] <Joanna> Do you have allergies or asthma?
[04:58:21] <jessicara> again, without much healthcare no idae
[04:58:23] <jessicara> idea*
[04:59:01] <Joanna> What would have happened if you had refused the shots?
[04:59:53] <jessicara> not really a good idea to say why, but yeah i'd be pretty stuck
[05:01:37] <Joanna> Well I’m sorry you are in such a bad predicament.
[05:02:56] <jessicara> this kinda thing would be solved if for the last 40 years hadn't been underfunding and mismanaging the nhs
[05:03:05] <jessicara> in particular mismanaging
[05:05:18] <Joanna> It’s funny how nobody ever wonders why the governments who care so much about our health and well being allow so much pollution.. everytime I go outside near streets I literally start coughing because of air pollution.
[05:05:47] <jessicara> yeah, luckilly up here in scotland it's quite reduced
[05:06:06] <jessicara> everyone i heard who was in london some time ago remembers the smog
[05:06:28] <Joanna> And then I feel guilty that someone might get scared of Covid as I choke on air pollution.
[05:07:54] <Joanna> It’s blatantly obvious in plain sight but nobody can see it.
[05:08:20] <jessicara> and then there is microplastic now, reminds me a lot of that asbestos problem..
[05:08:57] <jessicara> actually had a door made of asbestos here had to get carefully disposed of
[05:09:35] <Joanna> Oh yea the whole clothing industry is using synthetic materials instead of wool or silk.
[05:09:47] <jessicara> apparently in general small filaments of a certain size are just really prone to causing a lot of damage and cancers
[05:10:23] <jessicara> and then have this wide variety of tiny plastics are drinking and eating
[05:11:13] <Joanna> At least asbestos is useful for being fireproof. Synthetics only purpose is to make people looking for something to do with hydrocarbons rich
[05:11:41] <jessicara> cheap containers pretty much
[05:12:12] <Joanna> I’m really disappointed how it’s so hard to find stuff made of natural materials except cotton
[05:13:05] <Joanna> The plastic in ocean breaks apart the plastic in incinerators makes air pollution.
[05:14:23] <jessicara> i still think drinks in glass bottles taste better than plastic bottles
[05:15:16] <jessicara> it seems like this difference has got a lot stronger with so much recycled plastic too
[05:15:21] <Joanna> Of course it does. Disposable plastics are a disaster but all the infrastructure has been created to rely on them.
[05:15:47] <jessicara> yeah, there's plastic at every step
[05:15:53] <jessicara> long before it gets to the bags at the store
[05:16:47] <Joanna> Did they do that propaganda stunt of charging money for plastic shopping bags there?
[05:16:52] <jessicara> yeah
[05:16:54] <jessicara> lol
[05:17:06] <Joanna> As if that will solve the problem
[05:17:08] <jessicara> it's at the point pretty much banned the bags
[05:17:19] <jessicara> but then wrapped the individual items in plastic long before put in bags anyway
[05:17:34] <jessicara> kinda ridiculous
[05:17:58] <Joanna> It’s impossible not to generate a lot of garbage when buying food.
[05:18:05] <jessicara> the bag is so little plastic compared to the containers fit in the bag
[05:18:18] <Joanna> Indeed
[05:18:52] <Joanna> The reason for plastics is because stuff is produced far away
[05:19:35] <Joanna> They have yet to put bottles of beer in plastic though
[05:21:08] <jessicara> think it's just cheaper and well, it is kinda a strong container against the usual knocks
[05:21:57] <jessicara> unfortunate consequence of causing very small breaks which leak slowly over other things near it sometimes...
[05:27:17] <Joanna> I guess it’s good for some things like weight and being dropped but in the long term it isn’t worth it

[17:33:22] <jan6> also plastic is good SPECIFICALLY for long term, because glass gets microfractures over time, with normal handling, and eventually something as small as tapping it slightly too hard, could just break it, of course it depends on specifically what you're doing, how trick the glass is, is it tempered, etc etc
