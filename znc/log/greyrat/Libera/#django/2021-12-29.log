[08:48:43] <foo> https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/admin-interface-appears-broken/4327/17 seems like a CSS caching issue

[09:00:18] <foo> I think our install might be broken with this.
[09:00:29] <foo> I believe collectstatic writes to STATIC_ROOT
[09:00:31] <foo> Can someone confirm this?
[09:01:05] <pembo13> the docs should clarify, no?
[09:01:45] <foo> pembo13: yup, lookd like it  per https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#collectstatic
[09:02:01] <foo> I'm probably being overcareful in making sure I'm understanding given how odd my issue is
[09:02:10] <foo> aka. I'm overthinking things :)
[09:02:29] <pembo13> foo, what's the issue? I don't use collectstatic myself, so I won't be able to help there
[09:02:51] <foo> pembo13: ahh. I think there is some caching issue, we upgraded from django 2 to 3
[09:02:58] <foo> And the admin interface is being duplicated/significantly broken
[09:03:11] <pembo13> did you hard reload in your browser(s)?
[09:03:36] <foo> pembo13: I'm in incognito
[09:03:41] <foo> pembo13: (so yes, if I'm following
[09:03:47] <foo> pembo13: appreciate you "being there" - this is a bit odd
[09:03:55] <foo> We don't have any custom theming, either
[09:04:42] <pembo13> foo, production or dev?
[09:05:03] <foo> pembo13: dev, so not high priority - but we have a deadline for this migration
[09:05:10] <foo> pembo13: we being me and the other dev
[09:05:18] <pembo13> foo, that should not be an issue in dev
[09:05:30] <foo> pembo13: I'm wondering if someone copied previous admin files or such which is why this is breaking
[09:05:41] <pembo13> collect static shouldn't even be necessary (in my ignorance)
[09:05:57] <foo> pembo13: you're right, it shouldn't. I can take that off the table, then.
[09:06:04] <foo> I'm borderline desperate with why this is broken
[09:06:11] <foo> I do see an admin folder in static
[09:06:13] * foo renames
[09:06:38] <pembo13> hmm... odd
[09:06:52] <pembo13> i've never used collectstatic, so dev admin should be able to work without it
[09:07:38] <foo> pembo13: agree
[09:08:21] <pembo13> foo, if all else fails, `cp -` files, and start taking a part the static files till it works
[09:08:32] <foo> pembo13: I'm borderline there
[09:09:34] <foo> pembo13: just tried to rename our static/admin/ dir to static/admin-old/ to see if something in here was causing the problem, still looks broken
[09:10:01] <pembo13> define broken
[09:10:15] <pembo13> you should be able to be a bit more specific...
[09:10:22] <pembo13> are the wrong files being served? or 404s?
[09:10:48] <foo> pembo13: Please excuse my vagueness. I'm seeing the admin, but it's entirely duplicated. As in, I see 2 versions of the admin interface within /admin
[09:10:58] * foo checks templates dir
[09:11:33] <pembo13> foo, odd... i can't fathom... post screenshots if data isn't too sensitive
[09:12:29] <foo> pembo13: yup, looks like some custom admin/ template was causing this. I *think* I resolved it *has other dev check
[09:13:28] <pembo13> ah cool
[09:13:47] <foo> pembo13: thanks for "being there". We upgraded from django 2 to 3 and stuff broke. I think autocomplete is next on my list
[09:14:14] <pembo13> foo, you might as well go all the way to 4.0
[09:16:36] <pembo13> 2's been a long time now
[09:17:46] <foo> pembo13: ah. it's not my call but I can see about it
[09:18:14] <pembo13> if you're in there that deep... seems like you might as well go all the way

[10:07:16] <pembo13> good luck
[10:13:12] <foo> pembo13: thanks. I think I'm going to set up a stock version of Django to get a sense of what a stock sample site might look like in the admin
[10:13:15] <foo> I don't even know anymore, heh.
[10:13:41] <foo> pembo13: I just renamed admin dir and it looks like django admin now has a "dark theme" or something which looks different from the previous theme. Does that sound about right?
[10:13:50] <pembo13> hmm... hold
[10:14:13] <foo> pembo13: thanks /me opens incognito, same thing
[10:15:45] <pembo13> well it's definitely dark, in my Firefox Developer browsner
[10:16:02] <pembo13> this is Django 4.0, and Firefox Developer is in dark mode (I believe)
[10:16:05] <foo> pembo13: interesting, so maybe this is the core of the issue. I would be curious to see a screenshot if you're able to share
[10:16:09] <foo> ohhhh
[10:16:34] <foo> pembo13: actually, I did just check, it looks like django dark admin theme is a 3.2 thing
[10:17:38] <pembo13> foo, https://pasteboard.co/pID35N46MqD8.png
[10:18:03] <pembo13> i don't use the admin often these days myself, but recently touched it again

[10:20:18] <pembo13> foo, cool.. i'm guessing you can turn off dark mode for familiarity

[17:33:02] <ChrisWarrick> amanjhalmat12: how many apps to create is a design decision, and the answer depends on your code organization
[17:33:35] <ChrisWarrick> amanjhalmat12: sometimes everything lives in one app, sometimes your apps are distinct modules that do different things and they have their own models
[17:33:37] <amanjhalmat12> great so user model have to separate
[17:34:05] <amanjhalmat12> from others
[17:34:08] <ChrisWarrick> your custom user model? it might or might not be separate

[17:56:58] <yanchai> hi guys
[17:57:24] <yanchai> how do we implement realtime alert notification for unread post from django server to android app?
[17:57:51] <yanchai> like a notification bell icon adds 1 if there is unread post in realtime
[18:04:03] *** Quits: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[18:04:40] <ChrisWarrick> yanchai: do you want the notification when the app is not open? If yes, you need to integrate with https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging
[18:05:23] <yanchai> ChrisWarrick: if not what's the best way?
[18:05:52] <ChrisWarrick> yanchai: how often do you expect new posts to appear?
[18:05:59] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)

[18:07:09] <yanchai> ChirsWarrick: another question, my goal is to send data from django server to android app in order to turn off the alarm on the phone in realtime
[18:07:27] <yanchai> ChrisWarrick: this is a different scenario btw
[18:07:48] <ChrisWarrick> yanchai: if you expect posts to happen often, you might want something to keep a connection between your app and your server, eg. via websockets
[18:08:16] <yanchai> ChrisWarrick: ok ill search for this
[18:08:40] <ChrisWarrick> yanchai: a constant connection might solve the alarm use case, if you’re also okay with this happening only when the app is running in the foreground
[18:08:41] <yanchai> ChrisWarrick: how about turning off android app alarm via django server is it possible?
[18:09:03] <yanchai> ChrisWarrick: yes only when the app is running
[18:09:44] <ChrisWarrick> sending stuff over websockets should solve most of your problems
[18:09:56] <yanchai> Thanks mate!
[18:10:03] <ChrisWarrick> at least the real-time communication part
[18:10:09] <yanchai> using websockets does it requre to use firebase too?
[18:10:16] <ChrisWarrick> no
[18:10:19] <yanchai> cool
[18:10:21] <yanchai> thanks
[18:10:33] <ChrisWarrick> I’m not sure if django-channels are the cool thing, but you might be interested in it: https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

[19:09:43] <nbjoerg> if you don't run java, it doesn't apply to you
[19:10:01] <nbjoerg> you likely get a 500 because it triggers some assert or so, might want to check your exception logs for that
[19:14:37] <foo> nbjoerg: thank you, appreciate it. We don't deliberately run java anything, but I'm not sure if it somehow got on our system. I checked https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-test-if-your-linux-server-is-vulnerable-to-log4j/ and that script outputs this: https://bpa.st/QTWA -> not sure I can get a hold of our admin, and I realize running scripts from the internet to test stuff probably ain't the greatest
[19:14:43] <foo> of ideas (although I viewed that source code and it seemed reasonable).

[19:21:09] <foo> nbjoerg: I wonder if I need to upgrade django here to prevent this from happening? Or if I need to fix the traceback? Probably fine to leave it as is
[19:23:08] <nbjoerg> well, the trace back likely tells you what you should improve to change the 500 into a 404

[20:38:04] <circles> I am trying to imitate functionality within Django Admin that while adding one model it displays related models in a dropdown list and buttons next to that ddl to edit the current selected related model, or add a new one. When you click the "add" button, it opens a new window to the create a new model. Taking a look at django.contrib.admin source and a solution on stackoverflow it looks like it uses TemplateResponse on successful
[20:38:04] <circles> creation of the related model to return a template with javascript that injects the new item into the ddl of the parent window. Is anyone aware of a django package that automates this functionality? Seems like 'faux' databinding, but I am currently building a toy project and trying to focus on the tools provided by Django without getting 'caught in the weeds' by adding other frontend frameworks such as React into the mix.

[22:02:27] <nbjoerg> sorry, line 14
[22:02:41] <nbjoerg> line 17 is clearly not django, some middleware in a module called "request"
[22:03:02] <nbjoerg> line 26 and following is the normal django logic for writing to the database
[22:03:22] <nbjoerg> so something either in 17 or 20 writes something not an IP address
[22:03:51] <foo> nbjoerg: ah, site-packages/request -> ok, yes, that's a bit obvious then. Haha. Thank you. I'll look into the issues on django request and make sure I'm up-to-date there, grateful for the help.

[22:19:32] *** Joins: schemefusion (~schemefus@fedora/twohot)
[22:20:14] <pembo13> blackleitus, viewsets are more of a CRUD short cut, APIView is a lower level tool
[22:20:48] <schemefusion> Hi everyone.  I'm going bald trying to figure out why Django is throwing this error:""GET /static/images/user.png HTTP/1.1" 404 1804".  Whereas, the image is actually there.
[22:21:23] <pembo13> schemefusion, are you in dev?
[22:21:39] <blackleitus> +pembo13, which one should one use?
[22:21:45] <foo> pepper: to answer your question from earlier, PST
[22:21:58] <schemefusion> pembo13: what's that?
[22:22:27] <pembo13> blackleitus, depends on what you're trying to accomplish... read up on both then decide
[22:22:35] <schemefusion> pembo13: not sure I understand your question
[22:22:40] <pembo13> schemefusion, is this in development or production?
[22:22:49] <schemefusion> pembo13: oh, dev
[22:23:16] <pembo13> schemefusion, are you serving static files in development?
[22:23:17] <blackleitus> +pembo13, lower level means pretty custom format
[22:23:36] <pembo13> blackleitus, that's one way to look at it
[22:23:39] <gordonjcp> evening, I've used Django ages ago and am getting back into using it, and I'm having trouble working out exactly what to search for here - I want to create a model where two fields are unique_together but those two unique_together fields are also the key on which a ForeignKey is joined
[22:23:50] <gordonjcp> what should I be looking for?
[22:24:37] <blackleitus> +pembo13, sure, but you can still custom on viewset
[22:24:59] <blackleitus> overwrite create, update, etc
[22:25:18] <schemefusion> pembo13: please what's the way forward?
[22:27:29] <pembo13> blackleitus, correct
[22:27:49] <pembo13> schemefusion, are you serving static files in development?
[22:27:55] <blackleitus> what's the point of viewset or apiview?
[22:28:56] <pembo13> blackleitus, have you read up on either?
[22:29:26] <blackleitus> yeah
[22:29:41] <schemefusion> pembo13: yes
[22:29:42] <blackleitus> viewset inheret from apiview
[22:30:09] <pembo13> blackleitus, right, viewsets provide far more functionality by default
[22:30:29] <pembo13> schemefusion, are other static files being served?

[22:35:59] <pembo13> blackleitus, I can't (personally) provide such a guideline... it's up to you to apply based on your understanding and needs
[22:37:27] <blackleitus> any use case at least?
[22:38:07] <schemefusion> pembo13: now that you put it that way.  I does appear that all static GET are failing
[22:38:22] <pembo13> blackleitus, if you're just doing a simple API endoint that's not directly CRUD related, APIView should be fine
[22:38:43] <pembo13> if you're trying to quickly develop some CRUD based endpoints, viewset

[23:19:22] <Guest31> or if i do something like this syntax error in tsquery: "cry pto"
[23:20:15] <yuesbeez> can django static files be used in modules or are they only intended to be used in view templates? I am currently using pkg_resources.read_text to read json files but it requires the folder containing the files to have an __init__.py file so I'm not sure if that compatible with django static files
[23:22:34] <GinFuyou> yuesbeez, eah? what json file has to do with __init__.py ??
[23:23:25] <yuesbeez> GinFuyou: It doesnt. Its just otherwise pkg_resources fails with FileNotFoundError: 'file.json' resource not found in 'scripts_api.static'
[23:24:43] <GinFuyou> Don't use it then? What it is anyway?
[23:25:14] <foo> Uh, I just did pip install --upgrade django-request and it uninstalled Django 1.11 and installed Django 3.2
[23:25:17] <foo> ... that was probably for the best.
[23:25:18] <foo> Haha
[23:25:20] * foo makes sure nothing broke
[23:27:13] <GinFuyou> I'm not aware of any limitations on reading static files if you have to.
[23:32:14] <foo> Actually, this install is in Mezzanine ... I might have issues
[23:33:13] <foo> Meh, is mezzanine even around still or this dead?
[23:33:34] <foo> Nevermind, appears to be https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine
[23:34:47] * foo is probably going to break something in prodution and then smack himself
[23:35:56] <foo> well, I called that.
[23:44:35] <yuesbeez> GinFuyou: Its a json file I need to use in a module. Do you know if that should be a static file or just a file within a django app subfolder
