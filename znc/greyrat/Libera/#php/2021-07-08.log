[00:26:52] <AllenJB> I guess so. Note that I don't think that's actually required any more - see user notes regarding async signals, internals recently discussed deprecating declare ticks (but it's used for other purposes by some people)
[00:26:56] <epolanski> I've found this on php's docs but it says to not use it in production

[00:27:46] <AllenJB> epolanski: The closest thing in core would be php-fpm. PHP (traditionally) runs differently to long running processes that serve multiple requires like node
[00:28:08] <AllenJB> There are projects which can do that tho - look at stuff based on ReactPHP and Swoole, for example.
[00:29:46] <epolanski> ok ReactPHP might do what I need

[00:44:05] <biberu> that uses fcgi, and your script wouldn't have to worry about parsing requests (the easy part), buffering, scheduling etc., it'd just respond to the given input when asked
[00:45:34] <biberu> if you want to handle all of that yourself you have a fair bit of work ahead of you, and you might want to consider if php is the right tool / language for writing something like that

[10:35:36] <Skywise> how can i disable composer?
[10:35:49] <Viper-7> •ericlee• for PHP itself, it will only read the request body into a variable on first access. you can read it yourself with eg $fp = fopen('php://input', 'r'); while(!feof($fp)) { $line = fgets($fp); }
[10:36:11] <Viper-7> but usually the issue is getting your webserver to handle it progressively
[10:36:40] <ericlee> I did the same and the file is binary so I don't use fgets, but still it will read whole into memory
[10:37:18] <Skywise> a plugin for a cms i was installing just tried using it and i don't want that happening on my production systems
[10:38:05] <Viper-7> •ericlee• only on first use of a variable that needs the request body
[10:38:07] <Viper-7> eg $_POST
[10:38:16] <Viper-7> so, dont do that :P
[10:38:21] <ericlee> uh?
[10:38:49] <Viper-7> PHP defines variables like $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA at runtime, on first use - not at startup
[10:38:59] <Viper-7> its only then that its forced to interpret the request body
[10:39:28] <Viper-7> so if php is reading the whole request body, you're doing something that needs information from it

[23:44:50] <NCS_One> hi
[23:45:56] <lall-> helo bud
[23:45:59] <NCS_One> any good articles you recommend about when to use/not use SPAs?
[23:46:44] <lall-> what's an SPA
[23:47:04] <NCS_One> Single Page App
[23:47:19] <lall-> what's that
[23:48:03] <ss23> This channel more focuses on PHP, so I don't think anyone here is going to have any insight into that kind of topic sorry, NCS_One
[23:48:45] <lall-> what's single page app
[23:49:00] <NCS_One> ss23: SPAs can have a PHP backend
[23:49:53] <lall-> can't they have bash backend too? :/
[23:50:33] <ss23> NCS_One: I know
[23:50:38] <ss23> My statement still stands :P
[23:51:02] <lall-> if i google spa i get top 10 massage parlors.
[23:51:36] <NCS_One> lall-: https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/single-page-application/
[23:53:59] <lall-> landing page?
[23:54:45] <lall-> "A SPA application is a single page that continuously interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. Trello, Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter are a few single page app examples." they mean websocket eh?
[23:55:23] <NCS_One> no
[23:55:38] <NCS_One> can be ajax requests
[23:56:32] <lall-> there's no pros and cons of any method inherently. the pros and cons depend on your use case
[23:57:43] <lall-> are there cons to ajax requests? sure. the zealots that run around cursing JS
[23:58:28] <__adrian> NCS_One: if you have an spa with a php backend and you have a question about the php part of it, that's fine
[23:58:48] <__adrian> but the "spa" part of it, like ss23 says, is not on topic here
[23:59:23] <__adrian> i will compare a "traditional" php website with one that's just a nice api, though. that's nice.
[23:59:58] <lall-> i heard good things are happening in the spa.
