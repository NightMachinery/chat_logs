[01:31:33] <iDrougge> But I suppose it is feature-complete enough, at least.
[01:31:59] <riv> i think you could have a nice git 'hub' without any website at all

[01:35:39] <ngoldbaum> in principle there could be a good public foss code forge but they’d be competing with github

[01:35:55] <ngoldbaum> and the best we came up with before github was sourceforge and launchpad sooooo
[01:36:40] <ngoldbaum> also google code was a thing too
[01:36:42] <iDrougge> Stackoverflow is another thing that really should be community-run but instead is run as a company with a questionable business model.

[03:19:52] <kline> the remaining points confuse google as an indication of mainstream job openings, everything in compsci getting another pass cause new money, and the reapplication of - again - a surplus of compute power for bruteforce (just this time openly bruteforcing hashes instead of hidden layer connection weights)

[03:24:13] <imode> does seem like it's leading the question away from formal methods.
[03:24:20] <imode> and more to the validity of all of these other claims.
[03:25:49] <kline> imode, the question is "is the winter over", which is just a bet on if its a rising/falling tech trend. its not actually remotely technical, and i dont think lobsters has more than about 3-4 people qualified to talk about the future of cutting edge formal methods research, if that
