[17:17:45] <FromDiscord> <hamidb80> what is your opinion about clojure?
[17:17:53] <PMunch> I kinda like it
[17:17:53] <FromDiscord> <hamidb80> versus Nim
[17:18:05] <PMunch> Well, it's a lot less versatile than Nim
[17:18:07] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> clojure is awesome
[17:18:17] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> and their docs are amazing. But I wouldn't trade Nim for it
[17:18:23] <FromDiscord> <hamidb80> do you think learning clojure worth it?
[17:18:29] <PMunch> For example writing a small script in it wouldn't work great since the JVM would have to spin up first
[17:18:48] <PMunch> And yeah, the Clojure docs are amazing
[17:18:58] <FromDiscord> <zetashift> THere is babashka nowadays for that
[17:19:13] <PMunch> I'd say it's worth it if for nothing else you'll learn a functional language
[17:19:19] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> Personally I think it is worth learning. Or any lisp really (yea, yeah, that old comment). But clojure in particular because of its functional focus
[17:19:41] <FromDiscord> <zetashift> I'm learning Lisp by configuring my neovim with Fennel
[17:19:49] <FromDiscord> <hamidb80> ok, thank you both
[17:20:19] <PMunch> I can greatly recommend this resource for learning Clojure: https://www.braveclojure.com/introduction/
[17:21:32] <FromDiscord> <zetashift> +1 I've read a few pages it's solid↵(<@709044657232936960_=50=4dunch=5b=49=52=43=5d>)
[17:21:52] <FromDiscord> <hamidb80> does interactive REPL in clojure help much ?
[17:22:04] <FromDiscord> <hamidb80> how often do you use ut?
[17:22:06] <FromDiscord> <hamidb80> (edit) "ut?" => "it?"
[17:22:51] <PMunch> Can't remember, it's been ages since I tried Clojure
[17:23:04] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> yup, also a thumbs up from me for clojure for the brave and true. Own the physical book as well. I also own the joy of clojure, but haven't read much from it so far 🙈
[17:23:15] <PMunch> It's actually a roundabout way how I found Nim
[17:23:36] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> In the last \~2 years not at all really. Somewhat of a similar story as PMunch's for me↵(@hamidb80)

[17:37:06] <PMunch> When do you want it to call your callback?
[17:37:10] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Callback function for what? Just any random lib that has a callback functions? Can you describe what do you want it to do, or how you want to use it (e.g. what you are working on and what you are trying to figure out)?
[17:37:18] <PMunch> What kind of audio, what platform(s)

[17:40:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But I'm currently writing v2.0 that would be included with `hmisc` (because I don't want it to be a separate package since I do have some issues with dependencies)
[17:40:49] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> ok, cool!
[17:41:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> v2.0 would be full rewrite using google's global layout optimization, 256-color styling support etc
[17:41:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Well, it is mostly done, since I don't have to write layouter and most of the `T` -\> `PPrintTree` conversion is already implemented
[17:42:32] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> sounds great
[17:44:32] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But hpprint is fully usable even now, I just want to have a cleaner reimplementation and some additional features

[19:01:40] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> macros are great, but you can easily break them, add quite a few lines of code for barely any win, make you have to put the expression into some macro scope etc
[19:03:57] <FromDiscord> <Rika> its much work for little gain
[19:07:36] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In this case you can implement `a OP b OP c` using TRM macros

[22:50:26] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Is ! used for something else?
[22:52:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `!=` is a template that expands to `not(a == b)`
[22:53:16] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/version-1-4/lib/system/comparisons.nim#L130
[22:53:27] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Hmm
[22:53:46] <FromDiscord> <Alea> So I could make my own template that extends to not(a)
[22:53:57] <FromDiscord> <Alea> (edit) "extends" => "expands"
[22:54:26] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> You mean `template !`?
[22:54:49] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Yes
[22:54:53] <FromDiscord> <Alea> Or is that already in use
[22:55:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I don't think it is already in use, but I would advise you to not define `untyped` templates for such basic operators because at some point it will clash with other proc
[22:56:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> For example some library might implement `!`, and IIRC `untyped` template always wins in overload resolution, so it would be problematic
[22:56:20] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> To use this library
[22:56:43] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Also, nim mostly uses keywords for logic, so better to stick with `not/and/or/xor` etc.

[23:14:27] <kasperk81> hi, when running nim unit tests, i am getting an error like ".cache/nim/trepr_d/stdlib_repr_v2.nim.c:270:51: error: invalid use of incomplete typedef 'FILE'". i am not too familiar with nim, but i couldn't figure out what / where should i add missing linkage?
[23:15:12] <FromDiscord> <Canelhas> sent a long message, see http://ix.io/3r1y
[23:35:42] <kasperk81> any tips how to resolve it would be appreciated. :) 
[23:35:59] <kasperk81> detailed logs are at: https://paste2.org/bEOI3Awv
[23:36:08] <FromDiscord> <dom96> kasperk81: need more info, it sounds like your nim install is borked. Did you try just compiling hello world?
[23:37:15] <kasperk81> dom96: it's a unit test run of nim-lang/nim repo. it doesn't seem like an installation problem, as thousand of other tests are passing. it is specific to how this test is set up.

[23:45:00] <petrj> kasperk81: it does look like some linker flag is missing in this test setup. if most programs and tests are working fine, then this test requires some update https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/devel/tests/arc/trepr.nim (but i'm not sure how the typical fix for the linker/include errors look like in nim).
[23:47:47] <kasperk81> same, i read that test code a few times, but nothing is immediately jumping at me. someone familiar with nim internals might be able to spot the issue.
