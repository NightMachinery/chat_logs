[14:46:09] <drmpeg> The number of chat comments on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nT7JGZMbtM is too fast too read.
[14:46:15] <Crofton[m]> they have cheap beer :)

[14:59:46] <Crofton[m]> I was drinking PBR with some friends. My friend has a birthday on the 24'th. He never had birthday parties growing up
[15:03:51] <drmpeg> I like the watery beers. You can consume mass quantities and not get too kooky.
[15:11:13] <Crofton[m]> English beer, warm, watery and tastes good
[15:19:27] <drmpeg> I did get a little unglued. The dive bar was in deep San Jose and I live in Mountain View. When I took the exit off the freeway on the way home, I just had to pull over on a side street near the Googleplex. As I'm relieving myself in a bush, a bus pulls up down the street. In my drunky head, I'm thinking "he has to pee too!".
[15:42:13] <Yamakaja[m]> drmpeg: Take a look at the comments on that stream now. There must be 100+/s ?!
[15:42:22] <Yamakaja[m]> s/100/10/
[15:43:33] <Crofton[m]> this guy spolished his head for the event
[15:44:00] <Crofton[m]> this is getting serious, they switched to French
[15:53:36] <Hoernchen> so how does drmpeg s story end?
[15:56:44] <drmpeg> I think the bus driver was just taking a break. But it was weird that we meet on a side street at 3am.
[15:58:08] <drmpeg> Also, quite spoiled by SpaceX launches where you see everything.
[15:59:17] <Yamakaja[m]> Interesting trajectory, they're losing altitude right now
[16:00:00] <Crofton[m]> taking a shortcut!
[16:01:37] <Yamakaja[m]> Quite unfortunate that "aboard" and "abort" sound so similar ðŸ˜‚

[19:52:49] <schattenwolf2008> wow
[19:52:59] <schattenwolf2008> so i actually need to put that on my poor raspberry?

[19:53:05] <schattenwolf2008> microsoft is the biggest trash
[19:53:25] <schattenwolf2008> Thanks, you saved me tons of time
[20:05:02] <funkylab[m]> No your raspberry is not an adequate computer
[20:05:40] <Yamakaja[m]> Personally i'm not a fan of windows, but isn't that a bit harsh. You could try using a real VM (Or rather one with a normal interface) or run GNU Radio on WIndows
[20:05:48] <Yamakaja[m]> s/./?/
[20:06:16] <funkylab[m]> Nah VM virtualization has relatively bad USB 3 passthrough still
[20:07:39] <funkylab[m]> I'd honestly try the native windows installation through conda
