[05:52:09] <moon-child> gilberth: actually, I got two emails.  First was &amp;, second was &amp;amp;!
[05:59:10] <gilberth> Yeah, it gets more funny, when you happen to have non-ASCII chars in there, too. I once got one with &amp;amp;szlig; for just "ß". It's depressing at times.
[06:00:30] <gilberth> You still don't get wider then seven-bit characters through the net reliably. This is, why my HTML and JSON generation routines stick to 7-bit ASCII and don't make bets.
[06:02:38] <moon-child> I mean, html entities are not inherently problematic.  But it's a coordinate space problem: do you know whether your text is html or literal?
[06:02:58] <moon-child> well, that's how you get &amp;amp;amp;...
[06:03:07] <moon-child> other problem is that some of us have not agreed that email is a superset of w3*
[06:03:26] <gilberth> That's easy, you should know whether you produce plain text or HTML.
[06:06:47] <gilberth> moon-child: MIME is there for ages. E-mail clients usually don't have trouble with that. For those SGML entities I always suspect HTML servers and clients.
[06:08:25] <gilberth> Soem clients would, when in doubt, send the content of a submitted HTML FORM as entity escaped. This is completely uncalled for.
[06:09:00] * moon-child nods
[06:09:26] <gilberth> URLs are problematic, too. An URL is not made from characters, but from octets.
[06:10:55] <gilberth> Conclusion: It's a mess.
[06:33:35] <hayley> "What would convince me otherwise if I want to make gencgc parallel (but still STW)?"
[06:40:10] <aeth> replace the internet with a SLIME REPL
[06:40:15] <aeth> urls, everything
[06:40:30] <hayley> aeth: have you heard about this net farm thing
[06:40:48] <aeth> does it have a blockchain yet
[06:41:09] <hayley> the event log thing looks like a blockchain
[06:41:39] <aeth> but can I make 10,000x returns by using it
[06:41:48] <hayley> no
[06:42:05] <hayley> you can only make articles which are flagged on hacker news
[06:42:06] <aeth> what's the point of doing something if I can't gamble on it going up
[06:42:38] <hayley> aeth: fund hayley making SBCL parallel GC, your pause times will thank you later
[06:43:20] <gilberth> aeth: It would have indeed been nice, when we would have one syntax, perhaps s-expressions, and not a gazillion. And also not this extra micro-syntax for each single SGML/XML/HTML attribute or CSS property. Imagine all of HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS just using s-expressions. You would save ages in time in writing ad hoc and broken parsers and generators.
[06:43:38] * hayley reads the Handbook on parallel copying
[06:44:02] <hayley> The other question is if I even want to still do copying. Maybe that incremental incrementally [sic] compacting GC would be better.
[06:44:23] <aeth> gilberth: there was an s-expression RFC but it went nowhere
[06:44:28] <aeth> maybe just RFC candidate
[06:44:41] <gilberth> aeth: And when everything would be just s-expressions, I could could reliably read something with what the W3C comes up next year, this year.
[06:44:42] <aeth> was unnecessarily incompatible with all existing s-expression implementations in a few places, too
[06:45:09] <aeth> only problem with widespread s-expressions is that almost everyone who doesn't program Lisp/Scheme will put )s on their own lines
[06:45:12] <aeth> which is cursed
[06:45:39] <gilberth> Well, XML was once marketed as being this one syntax, which is a joke.
[06:45:55] <Catie> You should see some of the AutoLISP code out there, it's almost exclusively C programmers writing it
[06:45:57] <hayley> At this rate, I might ditch the text formats for Netfarm and just use binary formats with an obvious canonical form.
[06:46:06] <gilberth> aeth: It won't matter, who writes HTML manually, anyway?
[06:46:20] <aeth> I used to
[06:46:27] * hayley wants 0.5x speedup per core at least, but that's never going to happen.

[06:46:47] -ixelp- Doodle: hybridising SBCL's GENCGC with mark and sweep - Paul Khuong: some Lisp
[06:48:00] <gilberth> aeth: Sure, but you can place your parenthesis as you wish. Have you ever looked at the HTML source of my hosting of the clim-spec? E.g. <http://clim.rocks/clim-spec/index.html>
[06:48:00] -ixelp- CLIM 2 Specification — Common Lisp Interface Manager CLIM II Specification
[06:48:36] <hayley> Does it really help to have 7 generations rather than, say, 3 or 2?
[06:49:47] <gilberth> aeth: I keep the document in s-expression form and output it as HTML at the moment, you request it.
[06:50:41] <gilberth> This is how <http://clim.rocks/clim-spec/edit/apropos?q=draw-line> could show the function specifications found.

[06:51:47] <hayley> But then, should I make gencgc parallel, or wait for MPS-on-SBCL, then make the MPS parallel?
[06:59:01] <hayley> In either case, the problem is that threads need to be careful to not do something dumb if two try to copy an object concurrently.

[10:11:08] <gilberth> dave0: Ah! There you are. I just have no idea, what a coffee is today. Also depends on the city where you buy it. Hamburg is a bit more expensive than Berlin. Whenever I where out there, I always thought they forgot to bill me some beverages I had.

[10:18:04] <gilberth> That must really have been a strange experience.
[10:21:26] <gilberth> I once saw a documentary about a compass belt. People would wear a belt and it would indicate magnetic north by soft vibrations or sth similar. They would wear that all day and after a few days this was integrated be the brain just like any other sense. When the belt was removed after three weeks or so, they were missing this magnetic sense and felt "magnetic blind". The brain is an incredible machine.

[11:25:27] <hayley> gilberth: Yes, also I took a bit of care watching SBCL's register allocator.
[11:25:59] <gilberth> I see, so you fine tuned the code generator for SBCL?
[11:26:02] <hayley> (FUNCALL CONTINUATION) gets its own TAGBODY state, so that there is only one FUNCALL and thus register allocation prioritises other stuff.
[11:26:25] <hayley> I regard this as pretty compiler-independent, though I did watch SBCL specifically.
[11:26:38] <gilberth> ok
[11:27:35] <gilberth> I should rerun benchmarks against flex(1), because this is what I am interested in. Quite a tad bit larger automata for a full scanner.

[11:53:30] <selwyn> i don't know how they came to be
[11:53:37] <gilberth> Because git knows nothing about DEFUN?
[11:53:51] <gilberth> selwyn: I was just curious.
[11:55:08] <selwyn> ah
[11:56:26] <selwyn> i remember that someone claimed to me once that english should have 'ł' and no 'w' at all
[11:56:34] <hayley> Well, SBCL still believes it is on 2.0.7, but I guess I haven't finished merging. And now bootstrapping fails.
[11:57:15] <selwyn> but we are stuck with 'w' which is a big fudge 
[11:57:26] <gilberth> I mean, they sound almost the same. In older German texts you find e.g. "thun" instead of "tun", but there is no "th" sound in German; never was, this always puzzled me. Perhaps I hoped to draw some insight.
[11:57:59] <selwyn> was there ever 'th'?
[11:58:16] <gilberth> But then English spelling is just weird, anyway. What is "gh" for instance? Was it sth different once?
[11:58:49] <gilberth> selwyn: Never. Not a "th" as in English. This sound does not exist in German.

[12:03:28] <hayley> Maybe creating a counter table too early in bootstrapping breaks it. The error is in some %MAKE-HASH-TABLE.

[12:04:42] <gilberth> Somehow I love this history of languages stuff. But it is a good question why we don't see a "th" in German at all. Even Low German, doesn't have it. Does Danish have it? No. Lost?

[12:13:29] <moon-child> https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf
[12:14:19] <moon-child> thing is, his criticisms apply equally to education in other fields too, ime.  Not just math.  Math just seems to be in particularly bad shape
[12:14:41] <selwyn> i didn't like maths until i was 16yo
[12:16:46] <hayley> Reading it, so far it reminds me of https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/mark-wolfmeyer-in-defense-of-mathematics-and-its-place-in-anarchist-education
[12:18:02] <hayley> Particularly that Wolfmeyer argues that there isn't an obvious progression in capabilities, which the introductory painting story suggests.
[12:20:14] <selwyn> did you guys not enjoy it at school then?
[12:20:43] <gilberth> Math? It was boring, I hardly learned anything.
[12:21:33] <hayley> Well, the STEM classes were fun, because I had friends who had more interesting applications.
[12:22:31] <hayley> Someone asked me not long ago why we bother with solving linear equations. "Well, I have this little regular expression compiler, it ends up faster, but only after taking longer to compile. Thus, how long do we have to search to break even? That's a linear equation."
[12:22:58] <gilberth> The only fun was my physics class. We were just six students and thus had plenty of time to do real experiments by our own. Like measuring light speed, or the round trip time rather.
[12:23:16] <hayley> moon-child: lol, Wolfmeyer referenced this paper and I didn't notice.
[12:23:40] <gilberth> But otherwise: classes which are slowly paced and teaching you things you already know, are boring in general.
[12:23:46] <hayley> (Reminds me of when I mentioned the work of Lewis Mumford, and someone said Graeber said something similar. But then Graeber says he got it from Mumford too...)
[12:24:06] <moon-child> 'Current society witnesses mathematical knowledge as a powerful tool for some people to take from others, a program regarded to be anticollectivist'   wat
[12:24:30] <moon-child> follow that and it goes some dangerous places--
[12:26:06] <gilberth> Anyhow, I still believe my time at school was some waste of time.
[12:26:47] <hayley> How I read it is that mathematics is only presented for tHe InDuStRy, wherein you use models to decide who to sack, what to invest in, etc. At least, that's how statistics class came off this semester.
[12:27:25] <hayley> We're doing statistics for selling things, we're doing statistics for insurers, it's all in the domain of money-making. And sadly I can't think of any more creative uses of statistics.
[12:27:27] <gilberth> hmm
[12:27:28] <selwyn> i agree but that is done in an attempt to make it 'relevant' for the students
[12:27:43] <selwyn> otherwise they complain 'miss why are we learning this stuff'
[12:28:01] <moon-child> hayley: that article seems to be operating within a framework under which knowledge can have negative value (but mathematical knowledge happens not to)
[12:28:02] <hayley> Hence "a powerful tool for some people to take from others".
[12:28:04] <moon-child> I find that problematic
[12:29:28] <hayley> I thought it was more that the context encourages negative uses. Say, knowledge of nuclear physics is useful, but most people wouldn't like it if you used it to build a nuclear bomb.
[12:29:44] <gilberth> It's a of negative value also because the rest is not educated, not per se.
[12:30:39] <hayley> But I just recalled that this article helped convince me that my idea that computing is quite fun isn't too absurd. Or even the opopsite, that not having fun computing is more absurd.
[12:31:23] <gilberth> Who comes up with the idea that computing is not fun?
[12:32:21] <hayley> Most people.
[12:32:34] <gilberth> Really? Hmm.
[12:32:54] <hayley> My high school class involved writing programs that would run stupid math problems as Lockhart describes. But then I got bored, and wrote programs that wrote programs that would run stupid math problems.

[12:33:59] <hayley> To a zeroth approximation, it's a bit like "dogfooding". In class you're handling someone else's problem that seems pointlessly vague and impersonal, whereas if you just hack alone you know exactly what you're trying to achieve.
[12:34:27] <gilberth> selwyn: Hey, that sounds interesting. I keep that for later.
[12:34:38] <selwyn> looks like he does talk about w
[12:35:27] <hayley> And the latter is in party why I believe programming can be quite fun, which I wrote in TPoPOS.
[12:37:28] <hayley> "It is difficult these days to genuinely argue that people should consider learning to program; in part because there is higher demand for programmers, as well as engineers, scientists, and generally all that sort of industry, as more industries make use of automation and more software, and so all calls to "learn to code" seem to come from industry demands." - me

[12:41:32] <selwyn> i just found it tedious, and i could do well in it, until i found it interesting enough to apply for uni
[12:42:14] <gilberth> Well, about school. I quickly understood that school is not there to teach you things.
[12:42:15] <selwyn> but: programming is the area where i feel like i got screwed over by the education system
[12:42:31] <gilberth> selwyn: How so?
[12:43:16] <selwyn> i learned to code from java books out of the public library

[12:52:55] <selwyn> mine might be 150 pages lol
[12:53:05] <gilberth> IIRC we were supposed to write a bit more than 70 pages. But then our old "Diplom", which doesn't exist anymore, is a tiny bit, tiny bit, "higher" in education than a master.
[12:55:50] <gilberth> But, yes, when I write half a textbook about regular expressions in general. I could fill 70 pages.

[12:57:04] <gilberth> And aren't pages in a thesis formatted less dense as for a paper?
[12:57:08] <selwyn> yes
[12:57:16] <hayley> So I guess I can kludge through not having an ISUM for more test.
[12:58:03] <gilberth> hayley: The compiler knows another trick, which I sneaked in just for this dispatch.
[12:59:01] <hayley> Though I am short on [0-9] and X{N} syntax. Hm.
[13:02:02] <gilberth> But perhaps it's the same trick. I can't find the very commit.

[13:31:06] <moon-child> how does compile time compare though?
[13:31:35] <hayley> Terribad.
[13:32:12] <hayley> We can move compilation of REs to compile time with a compiler macro, but the compile time is shit compared to any special-purpose JIT.
[13:34:13] <hayley> Call it a RE superoptimizer, if you are bored. I might add a linter so that people don't complain that it's wasting time.
[13:34:42] <hayley> "Look at the error messages! Don't those other slow compilers like the Rust compiler spit out this shit, and people love those?"
[13:34:45] <moon-child> make it an RE JIT
[13:34:53] <moon-child> interpret, and if you notice the input is long enough, compile
[13:35:27] <hayley> Yes, I've considered it. But I need a nice format for interpretation, and a heuristic to decide when to compile.
[13:35:53] <gilberth> Dear. When are regexp actually online?
[13:36:16] <hayley> grep
[13:36:19] <gilberth> I mean as long as it compiles faster than I could type "grep", it's fine.
[13:36:32] <moon-child> input length/regex length > k
[13:36:58] <hayley> Hm, but compilation is O(2^n) to some totally arbitrary factor n which has to do with the RE.
[13:37:19] <hayley> But we already produce the DFA for interpreting, and can count the number of states.
[13:38:02] <gilberth> If you ask me, this compilation speed is still not relevant for any practical purposes.
[13:41:26] <gilberth> Rather consider all the gazillion REs hiding in some scripts in attempt to have sth like a parser. They're constant. All the time. Consider how many C cycles could be saved, when you would compile those offline.
[13:41:55] <gilberth> Or syntax highlighting in Emacs, say. Plenty of REs.
[13:43:35] <Gnuxie> dunno
[13:44:10] <selwyn> i am surprised that there are still open questions in res
[13:44:46] <Gnuxie> like if you can afford to spend more time compiling an RE than you will ever save by compiling the RE, then what is the point? 
[13:44:59] <gilberth> Well, before me nobody figured out how to do submatch addressing with a DFA.
[13:46:24] <hayley> IIRC Hyperscan puts simpler machines together, e.g. arbitrary combinations of string search, DFAs and NFAs. But it'd be a mess to implement.
[13:46:58] <hayley> So you could compile those separately, and each machine would be faster to compile.
[13:47:05] <gilberth> Gnuxie: Take Emacs. I believe you could save quite some cycles. You compile them once and be set. Or why do we have compilers at all?
[13:47:57] <gilberth> But then Emacs, with it's terribly slow Lisp, is a bad example.
[13:48:40] <gilberth> Otherwise, parsing speed in general is not trivial.
[13:49:16] <Gnuxie> sure, but you said for any practical purposes
[13:50:03] <gilberth> I don't see why saving 32ms with a single grep, I just typed in, would matter. I can't type that fast.
[13:52:14] <gilberth> You would face REs generated at run time. And all I argue is that this application is not of major concern.

[14:44:44] <hayley> Not a clue.
[14:45:11] * hayley wants to have one Cheney work queue per thread. Problem: how do you balance work like that?
[14:46:10] <hayley> If the queue spans more than a page, I guess some threads could steal pages to copy somehow.
[14:48:55] <shka> hayley: what is Cheney work queue?
[14:51:51] <hayley> Well, TL/DR Cheney's copying gc does a deep copy to collect garbage, and the trick is that the copy being produced is used as a work queue of more objects to copy.
[14:53:28] <shka> thanks
[14:53:32] <hayley> You shallow copy an object, then enqueue every object referenced by the copied object, and repeat until you run out of objects.
[15:02:09] <hayley> So here is the trick I have in mind: we can get some parallelism if we allow full pages of only shallow copied objects to be grabbed by another thread. This would also make locality marginally better, as there are fewer objects being traversed in each breadth first traversal.
[15:04:16] <hayley> It's nothing new, but it requires little modification to the GC to accomplish.
[15:09:51] <hayley> Ideally, I would make the GC move only when some heuristic deems it profitable, but that's even harder. Oh well.

[16:05:27] <luis> Structured Heap" paper
[16:05:57] <hayley> Well, it's not a slowdown with two cores, which is a good start. e.g. the NonBlockingHashMap likes to dip at two cores, but then catches up in performance later.

[20:53:21] <selwyn> have heard it claimed that the venera program was a much greater achievement than the moon landings
[20:53:26] <selwyn> what does #lispcafe think about this
[20:53:41] <shka> hmmm
[20:53:50] <shka> from technical perspective?
[20:53:51] <ck_> I have no strong feelings one way or the other
[20:53:52] <shka> no
[20:54:11] <shka> from the scientific perspective? perhaps
[20:55:41] <shka> the first landing attempt demonstrates how little was known about the venus at that point
[21:05:30] <selwyn> argument is that successfully transmitting data back was very impressive
[21:09:23] <shka> mmm perhaps
[21:09:46] <shka> on the other hand, apollo 11 had a TV cameras
[21:09:55] <shka> and there was LIVE transmission 
[21:10:09] <shka> which on one hand was a flex
[21:10:14] <shka> but impressive 
[21:25:48] <selwyn> flex?
[21:25:57] <selwyn> soviets couldn't do live transmission?
[21:26:29] <shka> well, they obviously could, case and point: the lunachod
[21:27:15] <selwyn> right
[21:28:42] <shka> but regardless, yeah, i don't think that transmitting data would warrant stating that Venera > Apollo
[21:28:45] <selwyn> wonder why org-mode won't wrap lines in the buffer
[21:28:48] *** Quits: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[21:29:17] <selwyn> i think the argument about transmitting data back is not so much about the fact that data was transmitted
[21:29:52] <selwyn> but the fact that so much came from a machine that was always going to melt
[21:30:03] <selwyn> and transmitted through a presumably noisy atmosphere
[21:31:01] <shka> well, i guess this ultimately a matter of opinion
[21:31:51] <selwyn> indeed
[21:31:57] <selwyn> but it is an interesting opinion

[22:44:47] <selwyn> i have no idea
[22:46:02] <shka> perhaps it is simply cascading

[23:05:30] <ck_> "YO influence me bro"
[23:07:07] <selwyn> i am kind of surprised that hacker news doesn't have the effect of directing massive amounts of new users to #lisp and the like every so often
[23:07:09] <selwyn> or does it
[23:10:20] <ck_> hah :)
[23:10:51] <ck_> I think there are at least three probability bottlenecks that don't play in favor of that outcome
[23:10:59] <ck_> are you familiar with n-gate.com ?
[23:11:07] <shka> the great lisp filters?
[23:11:12] <shka> :-)
[23:11:27] <selwyn> i recognise only the n gage
[23:12:12] <selwyn> ck: lol what is this
[23:12:29] <ck_> what I mean is that hacker news is full of full stack techbros, or at least it seems like they make up a huge margin of the discussion, that's part one
[23:12:47] <selwyn> > Hackernews has solved all these problems in their heads some years back
[23:12:51] <selwyn> no need to worry then guys
