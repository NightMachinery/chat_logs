[05:52:57] <drakonis> haven't completed it though
[05:53:12] <Xe> did you know that NieR music was in the opening ceremony for the olympics?
[05:53:32] <bkero> NieR or NieR: Automata?
[05:53:42] <bkero> Those are two different games.
[05:54:14] <Xe> it was Song of the Ancients, which was in Replicant, Gestalt, Automata and Replicant 1.22... so yes NieR is an accurate thing to say here
[05:54:32] <bkero> got it
[05:54:47] <drakonis> yes i have
[05:55:07] <drakonis> good music is good regardless of origin
[05:55:49] <Mai> the thing i really like about NieR music is that the person who wrote it all created a unique language for each song
[05:56:15] <Mai> so all of the music has this haunting quality to the vocals where you can't quite place what is being said
[05:56:54] <Mai> so you end up feeling the vocals as if they are another layer to the music instead of something that inherently has meaning to itself like it would if it was sung in English or whatever
[05:57:47] <bkero> I knew I could count on ##crustaceans for some good pedantry. h/t.
[05:58:02] <drakonis> does fallout 4 ever get good?

[05:59:13] <bkero> The Silver Shroud stuff is kinda fun
[05:59:17] <drakonis> skyrim is massively fixable
[05:59:21] <drakonis> which is something
[05:59:27] <Mai> new vegas is probably the closest we ever got to a proper fallout style game
[05:59:42] <drakonis> at least from what i've seen, there's mods that fix any aspect of it
[05:59:51] <drakonis> sekiro or souls like combat
[05:59:53] <drakonis> gosh
[05:59:56] <drakonis> its crazy
[05:59:57] <Mai> drakonis: yeah but skyrim is _able to be fixed_, the fundamental systems of fallout 4 aren't as amenable to such fixes
[06:00:45] <drakonis> i almost bought it during the current sale
[06:00:48] <drakonis> fo4 that is
[06:01:03] <Mai> let me put it this way
[06:01:14] <Mai> if it was $1 i'd find that a ripoff
[06:01:42] <Mai> if the main theme of skyrim is agency for the player, the main theme of fallout 4 is the illusion of free will
[06:03:28] <bkero> Outer Worlds might be the closest we ever got to a proper fallout style game

[06:06:50] <ngoldbaum> i’m hitting hard 3d jumps on my first try because the controls are nice and tight
[06:07:13] <ngoldbaum> and it really fees like psychonauts they nailed the feel
[06:07:39] <drakonis> outer worlds is a shame because its not a moddable game
[06:07:44] <drakonis> they dont have the modders to lean back on
[06:08:01] <Xe> song of the ancients is hard though
[06:08:16] <Xe> it has so many weird consonant sounds that english doesn't have

[06:09:38] <drakonis> but really

[12:55:44] <buttsbot> 🍑
[12:58:16] <Brekkjern> That tweet is hilarious
[13:00:35] <quanticle> I had Linux on my machine for last week. I switched back on Windows on Sunday.
[13:01:04] <quanticle> Like... there wasn't any single thing that was a dealbreaker. It was just an accumulation of little things
[13:01:17] <quanticle> Each of which I could have probably debugged
[13:01:35] <quanticle> But in totality made me go, "You know, Windows worked, and this... kinda doesn't"
[13:02:38] <quanticle> Like, for example, kdeconnectd running two cores at 100% because of https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433293
[13:02:39] <buttsbot> 433293 – Some KDE processes (like kdeconnectd) are not killed after session logout, hog CPU
[13:03:28] <quanticle> Or me waking the laptop from sleep and just... not having bluetooth any more
[13:04:27] <quanticle> Or the trackpad freaking out and randomly sending my cursor flying across the screen
[13:05:55] <quanticle> And the real killer: bash. Like... maybe I'm getting old or something but I'm at the point where I'm sick and tired of bash's arcane quoting rule. I'm done with dealing with text parsing the output of ls. I'm done with friggin' $IFS. Just... all of it.
[13:06:03] <quanticle> Powershell has spoilt me
[13:06:37] <gerikson> quanticle: haha check the main # ;)
[13:06:39] <quanticle> So I reinstalled Windows and went back to my old Windows + WSL setup
[13:07:01] <gerikson> my linux box is a VPS
[13:07:07] <gerikson> works good enough tbh
[13:07:18] <gerikson> work lappy = windows, home lappy = mac
[13:07:57] <quanticle> In effect, mine is the same. WSL 2.0 configures a lightweight virtual machine with Ubuntu and sets up shared files and shared networking.

[13:08:37] <buttsbot> Twatter - statictear - #Infosec #informationsecurity https://t.co/3lKxl1Kf44
[13:28:32] <gerikson> who knew 25 years ago that the best Linux machine was a "VM" under Windows...
[13:31:06] <quanticle> I'm not going to claim that this is the best Linux experience.
[13:31:25] <quanticle> The best way of describing WSL disk I/O performance is "dire"
[13:34:27] <quanticle> But nothing I do on Linux requires especially fast disk reads or writes, so it's all right
[13:43:04] <gerikson> yeah PS really falls down for stuff like "read a big file and report lines matching a string"
[13:44:21] <bkero> Anonymous pipes? Sounds complicated. We'd better have a whole object-oriented model to confuse everyone.
[13:46:22] <quanticle> bkero: Yeah, but my rejoinder to that is, "Structured data? Sounds complicated. We better just pass plain strings and force every shell utility to implement idiosyncratic text parsing."
[13:46:56] <quanticle> Also... the older I get the more I think that the entire existence of xargs is a terrible symptom of something having gone wrong at the very beginning.
[13:47:03] <bkero> One of these mapped the human genome project
[13:47:13] <bkero> Well, mapped the human genome
[13:47:15] <bkero> ...as a project
[13:47:38] <quanticle> Yes, and Facebook is written in PHP. Look, with thrust, even a pig can fly.
[13:47:42] <quanticle> *with enough
[13:48:12] <quanticle> Doesn't mean you should consider a pig to be some kind of paragon of aerodynamics
[13:48:28] <bkero> Many consider pipes to be a paragon of composable IPC
[13:48:31] <gerikson> lol
[13:48:40] <quanticle> lol
[13:49:16] <gerikson> Perl mapped the human genome
[13:49:21] <quanticle> Yeah, it's "composable" in that I can pipe find to mv and it works... except for when I have space in my filenames. Or unicode. Or hyphens.
[13:49:21] <gerikson> look at it now
[13:49:23] <gerikson> down and out
[13:49:47] <quanticle> Whereas with PowerShell Get-ChildItem -Filter "*.mkv" | Remove-Item works.
[13:49:51] <quanticle> Not works with exceptions
[13:49:55] <quanticle> Not works if you set $IFS
[13:49:58] <quanticle> It works
[13:50:51] <bkero> Try that with junctions
[13:52:08] <gerikson> I'm not convinced a full .Net object system is the future but it's at least a step forward compared to slinging (mostly) ASCII around
[13:52:24] <bkero> Also your Get-ChildItem doesn't include empty directories
[13:52:29] <quanticle> I mean, Unix shell utilities also don't do well with symlinks so, yeah, there are flaws on both sides. But day to day? I've had *far fewer* issues just doing the basics of bulk file manipulation in PowerShell than I have had with bash.
[13:52:31] <bkero> So if you planned on removing empty dirs from it...there's an exception
[13:52:35] <bkero> another*
[13:54:03] <quanticle> Well, the command I posted doesn't do anything with directories at all. The Remove-Item command I posted will fail if it encounters a directory, in exactly the same way that rm would.
[13:54:22] <quanticle> If I do Get-ChildItem | Remove-Item -Recurse, then yes, directories will go away
[13:56:04] <bkero> Not empty ones
[13:58:20] <quanticle> I just tried it and it worked
[13:58:42] <quanticle> Here, I can post my command list, one sec
[13:58:44] <bkero> Huh, then the docs seem wrong.
[13:58:46] <bkero> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-childitem?view=powershell-7.1
[13:58:47] <buttsbot> Get-ChildItem (Microsoft.PowerShell.Management) - PowerShell | Microsoft Docs
[13:58:53] <bkero> "Get-ChildItem doesn't display empty directories. When a Get-ChildItem command includes the Depth or Recurse parameters, empty directories aren't included in the output."
[13:59:37] <quanticle> Ah, yes, but if I run Get-ChildItem on the current directory, it displays all children, even if those children are empty directories
[14:00:03] <quanticle> And piping that list of child items into Remove-Item -Recurse causes them to be deleted
[14:00:05] <bkero> Ok, so it's still an exception, but only for recursive uses of Get-ChildItem.
[14:00:09] <quanticle> Yes
[14:00:17] <bkero> So it works with exceptions.
[14:00:48] <quanticle> Well, sure, but I'm saying that in my usage, I encounter this exception far fewer than the exceptions I run into with bash
[14:00:54] <quanticle> Most of which have to do with spaces and quoting
[14:00:59] <bkero> But you said it works without exceptions
[14:01:27] <quanticle> I stand by that statement
[14:01:31] <quanticle> It works without exceptions
[14:01:34] <quanticle> I just showed that it did
[14:01:42] <quanticle> You pointed out a *different* use case
[14:01:45] <quanticle> That does have exceptoins
[14:02:21] <quanticle> I was comparing ls | rm or find . | rm
[14:02:44] <quanticle> To Get-ChildItem | Remove-Item
[14:02:56] <quanticle> And Get-ChildItem | Remove-Item works way more reliably
[14:04:29] <bkero> More reliably than ls | rm
[14:04:37] <bkero> Arguably less than find -exec
[14:05:20] <gerikson> "hey, if this janky DSL doesn't resolve the issue, try this other janky DSL!"
[14:05:28] <bkero> They're all janky DSLs
[14:05:29] <gerikson> sorry , couldn't resist
[14:05:30] <quanticle> No, becasue find -exec still fails for files that have spaces or quotes in them
[14:05:36] <bkero> Uh no it doesn't?
[14:05:47] <bkero> find . -exec ls -l '{}' \;
[14:06:39] <bkero> Works just fine
[14:06:42] <bkero> even for files named '
[14:06:47] <gerikson> what's the only disallowed character in a Unix filename? "/" ?
[14:07:38] <quanticle> "/" and "\0"
[14:07:55] <quanticle> bkero: Oh, huh
[14:07:58] <quanticle> TIL
[14:08:37] <quanticle> Wait, why does that work, though? If find is exec'ing rm on the filename... then does find automatically quote the filename properly?
[14:10:07] <bkero> Yes
[14:10:40] <quanticle> Huh, okay
[14:10:50] <quanticle> Well, that's cool. I guess I learned a bit more Unix
[14:12:27] <quanticle> Okay, here's another question, then: I want to display all files that are not subdirectories, sorted by size. With PowerShell, this is easy: Get-ChildItem | ?{!$_.PSIsContainer} | Sort-Object -Property "Length"
[14:13:04] <quanticle> But with Unix, I can run find . -type f, but that just gets me names
[14:13:24] <quanticle> Or rather find . -type f -maxdepth 1

[14:38:35] <Brekkjern> I think you guys are misunderstanding the documentation of Get-ChildItem...
[14:38:47] <Brekkjern> If you do ls in an empty directory, there will be no output.
[14:39:00] <quanticle> https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7DCB/production/_120230223_6abd2921-15a2-4156-953a-a4469e03465d.jpg Cyberpunk IRL
[14:39:01] <Brekkjern> There literally are no child items to output as there isn't anything there
[14:39:55] <Brekkjern> If you add -Recurse, the empty directories will presumably be children of a non-empty directory, thus they will be included in the output
[14:40:10] <Brekkjern> The contents of the empty directory will not be (since... you know... it's empty...)
[14:40:28] <_ak_> quanticle: you can also just use ls
[14:40:41] <_ak_> ls -lS to sort by size
[14:41:05] <_ak_> add the -r switch to reverse sort order
[14:41:05] <quanticle> Yeah, but that outputs the names of subdirectories as well as files
[14:42:44] <_ak_> alright, hacky solution here -- add the -p switch and then pipe it through `| grep -v /'
[14:43:08] <_ak_> e.g. ls -lSrp | grep -v /
[14:43:24] <Brekkjern> If I need to open the man page of any command, it's not really a composable solution :S
[14:43:52] <Brekkjern> I mean... The point of the design of PowerShell is that Where-Item and Sort-Object are general implementations
[14:43:53] <_ak_> idk how intuitive the PS based approach is, but laying down pipes like a chad is what unix is about
[14:44:23] <_ak_> in this case it's one pipe, but i hope you catch my drift
[14:44:30] <Brekkjern> Well, if unix is the alpha male of laying down pipes, PowerShell is the sigma male :P
[14:44:36] <_ak_> lol
[14:44:44] <Brekkjern> I'm sorry. I had to :P
[14:44:58] <quanticle> _ak_: But that's exactly my point! You *didn't* lay down pipes. You added a bunch of options to ls, and then did some text processing on the output. Whereas I got an array of items, piped it through a filter function, and then piped the output of that into a sort function
[14:45:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[14:45:50] <Brekkjern> The PS snippet up there is basically this: generator | filter | sorter/formatter
[14:45:58] <Brekkjern> It's all generalized
[14:46:14] <quanticle> And then if I wanted to, say, display only the name and modified date of those files, I'd pipe the output of my sort into Format-Table
[14:46:21] <_ak_> you said something about `in powershell... this is easy'
[14:46:30] <Brekkjern> It's because it is :P
[14:46:44] <Brekkjern> Didn't have to open a man page at all to do  it
[14:46:54] <_ak_> that's brilliant
[14:47:15] <_ak_> i guess use what's more familiar to you
[14:47:16] <quanticle> _ak_: I maintain that remembering "Sort-Object" is easier than remembering that ls has a sort function if you pass the right command line flags to it
[14:47:21] <quanticle> But your opinion may differ
[14:47:57] <Brekkjern> The best part is that Sort-Object works on any property of the incoming object, and has switches to modify the sort order to your liking
[14:48:45] <_ak_> to be fair, long options may be more memorable to you
[14:48:47] <Brekkjern> You just indicate which property you are sorting by, if it should only output uniques, and if it should be descending
[14:48:48] <quanticle> Well, so does ls. Like, if I wanted to sort by mtime, it'd be ls -ltrp | grep -v /
[14:49:31] <Brekkjern> _ak_: Well, "Sort-Object -D -U -Prop LastModifiedDate" is valid PS
[14:49:48] <Brekkjern> I think sort is also an alias to sort-object
[14:50:01] <Brekkjern> Yep
[14:50:58] <_ak_> find has a surprising numer of options you can pass to it as well to filter your output
[14:51:54] <_ak_> remember that ls, find, and co. have only been around for some number of decades
[14:52:03] <_ak_> i'm not sure how long PS has been around
[14:52:31] <Brekkjern> 14 years
[14:53:05] <_ak_> and coreutils, findutils, and co. are older than you and i are i'd bet (maybe even combined!)
[14:53:13] <quanticle> Anyway, that just gets back to a point that I've been making for years, which is that the Unix Philosophy has 3 parts. 1) Each program should do one thing and do it well 2) Programs should be written to work together 3) Programs should operate on text streams. The problem is that (3) blows up (1) and (2). If you're operating on text streams, your program is going to have to have a text parser
[14:53:16] <quanticle> in addition to whatever its actual functionality is. And, because text is unstructured, the next program won't be able to rely on a single standardized input format.
[14:53:27] <river> agreed
[14:53:37] <quanticle> Powershell abandons (3) and tries to save (1) and (2)
[14:53:42] <river> really well put
[14:54:01] <river> there's so much pushback against this idea because of the hero worship of the original UNIX developers
[14:54:34] <_ak_> river: i'm not sure how true that is -- but admittedly those guys are pretty awesome in my book
[14:54:36] <Brekkjern> quanticle: It's more that PowerShell makes 3 optional
[14:54:42] <river> _ak_, they are great!
[14:54:46] <quanticle> Yes
[14:54:58] <quanticle> Powershell makes (3) optional in order to try to save (1) and (2)
[14:55:01] <_ak_> do you guys remember the article arguing for json?
[14:55:06] <Brekkjern> Yes
[14:55:07] <_ak_> someone posted it the other day
[14:55:09] <river> it's just this idea that what they created is perfect and any change is worse
[14:55:50] <_ak_> in some cases change is needed (society)
[14:56:10] <_ak_> rapid, change that is
[14:56:45] <_ak_> but this is one of those cases where muscle memory and familiarity breed contempt to change
[14:58:06] <_ak_> granted, you may live in an ok society that doesn't need such (rapid) changes
[14:58:46] <_ak_> river: what changes are truly the most controversial?
[14:59:36] <_ak_> quanticle: i do like what you said there earlier -- you've given me something to ponder re PS
[15:01:57] <_ak_> how about ls --sort size --reverse?
[15:02:16] <_ak_> as far as remembering goes?
[15:02:22] <quanticle> Yeah, that works, I guess
[15:02:25] <Brekkjern> It doesn't
[15:02:30] <Brekkjern> It's still part of ls
[15:02:37] <quanticle> Yeah, that's a separate point
[15:02:45] <Brekkjern> So now ls has to include sorting, breaking point 1
[15:02:50] <quanticle> But as mnemonics go, the long options are easier
[15:03:10] <Brekkjern> And it's gonna implement this differently from how you sort the memory usage of programs using whatever command you use for that
[15:03:26] <quanticle> I feel like ls isn't a great example for this; the better examples are things like tar
[15:03:49] <Brekkjern> lol tar
[15:04:02] <_ak_> tar is a classic!
[15:04:08] <Brekkjern> Whenever it's mentioned I think back to my rant on that...
[15:04:17] <quanticle> Yeah, but... Unix Philosophy it sure ain't
[15:04:43] <_ak_> also, how about find?
[15:04:50] <quanticle> Yep, find too
[15:05:10] <_ak_> say for example, i only want larger files than 175M?
[15:05:18] <_ak_> find -size +175M
[15:06:12] <Brekkjern> ls | ? {$_.Length -gt 175 * 1MB)
[15:06:22] <_ak_> files that were changed less than a minute ago?
[15:06:30] <_ak_> find -cmin 1
[15:07:28] <Brekkjern> That's kinda finicky, but not impossible
[15:08:00] <_ak_> i do enjoy this game
[15:08:16] <Brekkjern> ls | ? {$_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddMinute(-1))
[15:08:25] <_ak_> admittedly, i have been more close minded to PS than i should be
[15:08:39] <_ak_> but such is life when you work in a *nix environment
[15:08:42] <quanticle> Yeah
[15:09:23] <_ak_> i'm one of the youngest guys in my team -- i won't be the one to argue the virtues of PS
[15:09:41] <_ak_> teaching an old dog new tricks?
[15:10:20] <_ak_> granted, my dog is doing alright on her 15th year
[15:10:30] <Brekkjern> Does it know PowerShell though?
[15:10:36] <_ak_> despite being deaf and nearly blind, she learned sign language
[15:10:53] <quanticle> I mean, what made PowerShell really "click" for me was when I started using youtube-dl to watch Youtube, because the web UI of Youtube just got to be too much. So I ended up with like 3.6 TB of random Youtube videos, all of which have spaces in their filenames, many of which have random unicode and quotes in their filenames. And I was using PowerShell to move all these videos around and I
[15:10:56] <quanticle> noticed something: not once did I have to worry about quoting. I could do random wildcard expressions and they worked without my having to worry about whether the output would have spaces in it.
[15:10:57] <_ak_> Brekkjern: does not know PS
[15:11:42] <_ak_> quanticle: i may have a similar problem in the future as i browse yt similarly
[15:11:54] <_ak_> so you may hear from me later on that one
[15:11:59] <quanticle> And it's like... if I'd tried to do this in bash, I'd have spent half my time figuring out what sequence of backslashes and quotes I'd need to make my command pipelines work on everything
[15:12:04] <_ak_> how do you dl your videos by default?
[15:12:18] <quanticle> Just youtube-dl "<url>"
[15:12:34] <_ak_> i use something along the lines of
[15:12:42] <_ak_> youtube-dl -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" ...
[15:13:24] <quanticle> Oh, I use the default because I like the fact that it puts the original video ID as part of the filename
[15:13:46] <_ak_> ytdl -x --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 128k --keep-video ....
[15:14:05] <quanticle> Because then, if I want to share the video with someone else, I can just copy out that part of the filename and send a link to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<video ID>
[15:14:05] <buttsbot> YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
[15:14:06] <_ak_> ^ something i use for extracting audio (and keeping the video if need be)
[15:14:12] <Brekkjern> I wish there was a decent standard for adding arbitrary metadata to a file
[15:14:33] <quanticle> I mean, there *was*. Classic MacOS had that ability
[15:14:41] <Brekkjern> NTFS has alternate file streams, but that is easy to lose when moving the files around
[15:14:46] <quanticle> But no one else did, and when MacOS made the transition ot OSX it lost that ability
[15:14:49] <_ak_> that's a good argument for keeping the file name
[15:14:57] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[15:15:18] <Brekkjern> It's just that a file name is just a bunch of bytes, and there's no real structure to them
[15:15:24] <_ak_> you all ever get into file archiving?
[15:15:32] <Brekkjern> What do you mean?
[15:15:52] <_ak_> storing a large amount of files and keeping everything organized
[15:16:05] <_ak_> said files are stored in various locations / drives/ servers / etc ...
[15:16:32] <Brekkjern> I have a NAS with 32TB of usable storage if that's what you're getting at :P
[15:17:14] <_ak_> how about when you run out of those 32TB?
[15:17:19] <quanticle> Brekkjern: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2001/08/metadata/ John Siracusa has an article from *literally* 20 years ago bemoaning the problem that you highlight

[15:17:22] <Brekkjern> Working ona ceph cluster
[15:17:24] <_ak_> and how about keeping track of copies / backups?
[15:17:35] <quanticle> I go back to it every so often, to remind myself of what could have been.
[15:18:12] <_ak_> this may sound like too much, but i've grown incredibly fond of git-annex
[15:18:52] <_ak_> irreplaceable family archives i'll keep on numerous mediums / remotes to be safe
[15:19:59] <_ak_> but you can store an arbtritary amount metadata to each and every file you track in git-annex
[15:22:42] <quanticle> Huh, I should check out git-annex
[15:23:02] <_ak_> incredibly powerful, gives all power to the user
[15:23:06] <gerikson> look, if you're making fun of tar's options, don't bring up git ;)
[15:23:23] <_ak_> man git ...
[15:23:28] <_ak_> the stupid content tracker
[15:23:40] <quanticle> Haha
[15:24:44] <quanticle> I excuse git, though, for the same reason that I excuse sed and awk
[15:25:00] <_ak_> git has changed my views on life
[15:25:09] <quanticle> Basically it doesn't try to pretend that it's doing one thing and doing it well
[15:25:10] <_ak_> and it proved that linus torvalds isn't a one hit wonder
[15:25:11] <quanticle> ;)
[15:28:27] <Brekkjern> Hah
[15:28:36] <Brekkjern> Found my rant on tar/man pages

[15:34:03] <gerikson> Brekkjern: not to mention that if you want to search for a string starting with "-" in man/less, you need to escape it
[15:34:20] <gerikson> I mean, just having hyperlinks for each option would help immensley
[15:34:24] <_ak_> is that true?
[15:34:27] <gerikson> maybe info can do that
[15:34:36] <_ak_> lol, info...
[15:35:00] <_ak_> idk if this is uncommon, but i do not need to escapse - when searching
[15:35:00] <gerikson> I reflexively search for \-c
[15:35:20] <gerikson> huh, don't need to do that now :D
[15:35:33] <gerikson> must have been something I picked up ages ago
[15:35:46] <Brekkjern> I rarely have to escape things in pwsh, but when I do I have to press ` to do it
[15:35:54] <quanticle> Yeah, that's annoying
[15:35:59] <Brekkjern> Yes, ` is the escape character...
[15:36:09] <quanticle> Makes it harder to see when things are escaped
[15:36:13] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[15:36:36] <_ak_> what do you all use ps for and how did you pick it up?
[15:37:02] <Brekkjern> I wanted to automate shit and I was on a Windows machine
[15:37:20] <quanticle> Basically the same thing, plus what I said about organizing Youtube downloads above
[15:44:20] <_ak_> i asked a question about snus the other day
[15:44:24] <_ak_> curious to hear a little more
[15:44:39] <_ak_> how commonly do people enjoy snus out there?
[15:45:55] <river> man pages have bad ui/ux
[15:46:04] <gerikson> it's more usual than you think
[15:46:21] <gerikson> becasue it doesnb't have to be a big ole gross wad of tobaccy
[15:46:27] <river> the standard response for this for decades has been "toughen up" and "deal with it", instead of improvin them
[15:46:45] <gerikson> I do think there's been more effort targetting younger women with snus
[15:47:13] <_ak_> river: what do you not like about man pages?
[15:47:13] <gerikson> but I also think the consensus is that it's not as bad as smoking so there's not been a ton of pushback
[15:47:40] <river> it takes over your terminal so you can't put together your command line while reading the man page
[15:49:39] <gerikson> "just use tmux" ;)
[15:49:55] <_ak_> ^
[15:50:13] <river> wow i never thought of that, i guess my complaint is invalid
[15:50:28] <river> if you tried to approach GNU like "I want to improve man pages, here are some preliminary patches" they would get dropped so fast
[15:50:46] <gerikson> ``Despite snus being banned for sale in the EU, it can often be found for sale in places frequented by Scandinavian tourists, such as Chania in Greece or Murmansk in Russia.''
[15:50:55] <gerikson> ... Murmansk ?
[15:51:00] <Brekkjern> Jesus I hate bash scripts
[15:51:03] <Brekkjern> Holy fuck they are so bad
[15:51:12] <_ak_> do tell more
[15:51:46] <Brekkjern> I'm trying to adapt a script to PowerShell
[15:51:54] <river> _ak_, whats your view on all this stuff?
[15:52:09] <_ak_> river: man pages?
[15:52:17] <Brekkjern> The script pings every node in a kubernetes cluster from every node to check the connectivity
[15:52:34] <river> _ak_, yes and more generally this unix stuff
[15:52:50] <_ak_> honestly, i love it

[15:55:18] <Brekkjern> river: It's a pain in the ass to adapt though...
[15:55:22] <river> is kubectl ok to work with?
[15:55:28] <Brekkjern> Eh
[15:55:53] <Brekkjern> It has a json output option, so I can pipe that to ConvertFrom-Json and work with it natively in PowerShell
[15:55:55] <Brekkjern> So that's nice
[15:55:56] <gerikson> the best part about Unix afficionadoes is that if you categorically state something is impossible in bash, thy will prove you wrong, swiftly and at no charge ;)
[15:56:38] <Brekkjern> I'd prefer to work with kubectl through something like this though: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/native-commands-in-powershell-a-new-approach-part-2/
[15:56:38] <buttsbot> Native Commands in PowerShell - A New Approach - Part 2 | PowerShell Team
[15:59:07] <_ak_> what's the ps equivalent to bash's $() and <() and other similar bashisms?
[16:01:56] <Brekkjern> They are the same AFAIK
[16:02:06] <Brekkjern> Well... it depends
[16:02:23] <Brekkjern> From this example here: ls | ? {$_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddMinute(-1))
[16:03:03] <Brekkjern> The (Get-Date) part means that it's run first so I can interact with the methods of the object
[16:03:23] <Brekkjern> I see I fucked up some paranthesis in the original example too...
[16:03:45] <Brekkjern> $() is used for doing shit inside strings usually
[16:04:31] <Brekkjern> <() doesn't really make sense in pwsh as I understand it
[16:04:58] <_ak_> as in, pwsh programs don't take files as input
[16:05:02] <_ak_> ?
[16:05:07] <Brekkjern> Correct
[16:05:19] <Brekkjern> They receive objects down the pipeline

[16:08:00] <Brekkjern> Few people who have not actually used it understand much about it :P
[16:08:23] <Brekkjern> They assume a lot of stuff with their baggage from Unix shells, and misunderstand a lot about its design
[16:08:57] <quanticle> gerikson: Haha
[16:09:36] <river> do you think it was the correct decision to implement powershell that way? instead of having every object serialized and deserialized between processes? (like being closer to unix)
[16:09:44] <quanticle> gerikson: The downside to that is that the solution will often be sanity-lowering
[16:10:44] <quanticle> Pro-tip: If you ever seen grep or cut being used more than once in a pipeline... just implement it in Perl or Python. It's not worth the pain.
[16:11:18] <_ak_> perhaps that's what sed and awk are for as well
[16:13:07] <_ak_> interestingly enough, i've noticed that sometimes intense pipes involving multiple tr | cut | tail | head | etc
[16:13:42] <_ak_> are often still faster than using sed or awk for the same task
[16:13:51] <Brekkjern> river: Why not both?
[16:14:14] <river> that would be the best
[16:14:16] <_ak_> a few ms vs a few more ms but when you're running the same pipeline thousands - millions of times
[16:14:26] <Brekkjern> river: You can pipe powershell objects to a program that only expects text. PowerShell will just make it into a string as it passes the boundrary.
[16:26:45] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: In the bash script, the real culprit looks to be the kubectl command. In terms of bash, very little is happening except basic control flow
[16:27:26] <gwozniak> I don't know kubectl at all, but it's clear that it's trying (or is?) its own shell
[16:27:31] <gwozniak> So a shell within a shell!
[16:27:37] <gwozniak> Seems like fun
[16:28:34] <gerikson> a new janky DSL
[16:28:58] <gwozniak> Also, idolizing Linus because of Git is not a point of virtue (to reply to something a while ago)
[16:30:22] <quanticle> Yeah, especially because git gets lots of things wrong
[16:30:30] <quanticle> Like, git's command structure makes no sense
[16:30:48] <quanticle> How many completely orthogonal tasks are encompassed by `git checkout`?
[16:31:05] <gwozniak> I'm used to Git. That does not mean I like it. Similar for bash

[16:32:58] <quanticle> There's a meme that goes, "Oh, git's easy to learn once you understand that it's working on a directed acyclic graph." I get where it's coming from, but I disagree. The directed-acyclic-graph part is easy to understand. What's difficult is that none of git's commands make it obvious what they're going to do to the directed-acyclic-graph.
[16:33:00] <gwozniak> Git is such a goddamn UI mess I don't even know where to start. Once I started using Magit, I pretty much left the CLI version behind
[16:33:17] <quanticle> And some, like the aforementioned `git checkout` will do *radically different* things
[16:33:25] <quanticle> Depending on what parameters you pass
[16:33:29] <gwozniak> Yeah, it's a terrible name for the command
[16:33:37] <gerikson> quanticle: isnm't that a bit like the famous piss-take about monads in Haskell?
[16:34:14] <quanticle> Yeah, that's what I was getting at. Like, even if you know that it's a directed acyclic graph... you still don't know git
[16:34:55] <gwozniak> Yuo
[16:34:59] <gwozniak> *yuo
[16:35:01] <gwozniak> dammit
[16:35:04] <quanticle> lol
[16:35:19] <gwozniak> Trying to move arond and type is a bad idea
[16:36:48] <gwozniak> As of the bash v. PS stuff, both support piping/composition and transformation so I don't see the point of trying to compare commands. I'd take structured data over unstructured data, but there are times I want it unstructured
[16:36:59] <ngoldbaum> it’s a crying shame https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/ is still funny
[16:36:59] <buttsbot> Git man page generator
[16:37:47] <gwozniak> I've written so many janky "parsers" in bash pipelines and scripts and I'd prefer not to do that
[16:38:43] <_ak_> gwozniak: magit> wow, maybe a reason to pickup emacs

[16:40:22] <Brekkjern> That's the converted script. It kiiinda works
[16:40:33] <Brekkjern> But it does what I needed it to do, so eh..
[16:41:45] <quanticle> ngoldbaum: That git man page generator is great.

[16:42:51] <ngoldbaum> quanticle: it was better when it didn’t have the banner explaining that it’s a joke
[16:43:14] <quanticle> `git-fornicate-head -- negligently fornicates upstream HEADs next to spare noted shells, repacks reflogs, etc.` <-- This seems like a useful command
[16:54:48] <Brekkjern> >git-teach-evil-mergevigilantly teaches local evil merges using upstream notes, while aging relevant garbage collectors to sponsor the given evil merges.
[16:56:42] <mouseghost> something something my internet no working
[16:56:56] <Brekkjern> Internyet
[16:58:07] <mouseghost> haha
[17:05:00] <gwozniak> Oh no, Brekkjern, your converted script is longer and therefore worse
[17:05:14] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: I was waiting for that :P
[17:05:36] <Brekkjern> "Oh no! Verbosity! My carpal tunnel syndrome!"
[17:05:43] <gwozniak> Well, really I should have put the '/s' there
[17:05:49] <Brekkjern> Haha
[17:06:08] <Brekkjern> No worries. I got the sarcasm :P
[17:07:21] <Brekkjern> It actually does a few things extra that the original script doesn't do, plus some better output
[17:07:22] <Brekkjern> So...
[17:07:26] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:08:14] <Brekkjern> Also, it doesn't really follow best practices for PowerShell, so it's not really a good example for that either :P
[17:08:39] <gwozniak> I wrote a build system thing at work in (ba)sh. It seems to work well and I've gotten a couple of complements from coworkers on it. But...
[17:09:41] <gwozniak> I only chose bash because a) it had to run on unix and b) most of my teammates were familiar with shell code already.
[17:10:23] <gwozniak> It has many sharp edges precisely because that's what shell code is: lots of sharp edges when you try to do anything significant in it
[17:10:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[17:10:33] *** Joins: bontaq (~user@ool-18e47f8d.dyn.optonline.net)
[17:10:56] <gwozniak> Python or Perl would have been better because then I wouldn't have to impose ad hoc structure all over the place
[17:11:17] <gwozniak> The "plain text" aspect is, in fact, its achilles heel
[17:13:59] <Brekkjern> Pretty much
[17:14:15] <gwozniak> For example: each build definition has a configuration stored in an array, which is just strings. There is a hook that runs very late that lets you alter the config. Altering the config is a genuine mess because of the lack of structure. It relies on following a convention that must be clearly documented
[17:15:03] <Brekkjern> Also, it's not "plain text", but rather bytestreams.
[17:15:08] <Brekkjern> That's besides the point though
[17:16:27] <gwozniak> And for the quoting thing in xargs, well, I have some use cases that are a fucking horrible mess, precisely because of "plain text" and forcing everything through a pipe
[17:24:05] <cb> quanticle: you forgot git index
[17:24:14] <cb> oops! you didn't modify the DAG
[17:24:22] <cb> you modified a structrure that declares intent to modify the DAG
[17:24:51] <cb> https://sporks.space/2021/08/18/it-never-had-to-be-like-this-the-git-index/ i wrote about it
[17:24:52] <buttsbot> It never had to be like this: the git "index" - the sporks space
[17:29:18] <ngoldbaum> it would be pretty nice if angersock would stop it with the furry baiting and then pretending like it was actually vry srs criticism
[17:39:47] <Brekkjern> His first post wasn't all that bad, but he had to go fuck it up
[17:40:45] <wrl> and fucking H_S with the "not ALL men" comment
[17:40:56] <hoistbypetard> i should make a firefox extension that gives me a content warning when i click comments if there are multiple 'sock comments there. that has a high correlation with part of the thread being burning trash.
[17:43:06] <hoistbypetard> it wouldn't really cause me not to click through, though, so it'd be a lot of work for a minor payoff :)

[19:30:44] <wrl> manicennui: not all of them
[19:30:49] <_ak_> why are we talking about war criminals
[19:31:06] <manicennui> wrl: All I see is people supporting his idiocy.
[19:31:40] <wrl> manicennui: a handful of them, but there's the "what about the 1/6 insurrectionists" which is good, and also the "very disappointed in you brian"
[19:31:56] <wrl> regardless, it's been really sobering to see the respose of the strength "community"
[19:32:05] <wrl> i found out that the woman who owns the gym i train at is an antivaxer
[19:32:10] <wrl> leftist, anarchist, but antivaxer
[19:32:13] <_ak_> insurrection is an interesting word
[19:32:15] <wrl> was parroting covid conspiracy shit
[19:32:36] <manicennui> I don't know. It seems like a large percentage of the community are in the "it's not that bad" or "you have nothing to worry about if you are strong" camps.
[19:32:52] <_ak_> the last time i had heard that word was when studying american revolutionary history -- apparently that's what the british called the american revolution

[19:35:21] <manicennui> It was basically the same type of fight against the law that rich people wage today.

[19:40:49] <prussian> sure.
[19:41:06] <manicennui> Which is disappointing, because I generally liked Shaw.
[19:41:07] <prussian> I wouldn't worry too much about it.
[19:42:15] <manicennui> I'm not really worried about it other than the fact that a good chunk of the US population is dragging this thing out with their stupidity.

[21:35:55] * ngoldbaum contemplates buying a new tv
[21:36:26] <ngoldbaum> the differentiators between different models at wildly different price points in consumer tvs is very obnoxious
[21:36:48] <ngoldbaum> most of it is marketing bullshit or things i actually don’t want
[21:38:16] <manicennui> Think of what the poor companies want!
[21:38:23] <dasm> buy the one with the most internet apps on it
[21:38:23] <manicennui> Don't be so selfish.
[21:38:40] <dasm> it always means good thing, if there is a lot of apps.
[21:40:36] <dasm> actually, i might be forced to buy ne really soon. vizio, which i have atm, is making issues: https://www.reddit.com/r/VIZIO_Official/comments/pazjoh/vizio_black_screen_after_recurring_split_screen/

[21:40:46] <dasm> > Your Vizio tv is 5 years old. It was NOT meant to last longer than that.
[21:40:48] <cb> TVs look like such a clusterfuck
[21:40:49] <dasm> :D
[21:40:59] <cb> and tbh i watch stuff so rarely and i actually kinda prefer watching that at a desk
[21:41:11] <cb> monitor market is dumb but less dumb than TVs
[21:42:31] <dasm> idk. monitor market seems to be like 144Hz, 50", curved, 4k, vertical and horizontal something something
[21:42:48] <dasm> i don't even know. if i'd need to buy a new monitor, i'd be screwed.
[21:50:34] <cb> worst case i've got a nice old 4:3 ultrasharp
[21:55:01] <prussian> dasm: irony. I've had a 10 year old visio. worst it had was non uniform dim areas since I imagine the LCD was wearing out.
[21:55:28] <prussian> what is an "official VISIO Sub-Reddit"
[21:55:29] <prussian> ...
[21:55:44] <cb> it's for people who really love flowcharts
[21:57:03] <dasm> prussian: i bought mine 2016. it started doing that few months ago. i read that: 1. they don't make replacement parts; 2. it's just failing after about 5 years.
[21:57:12] <dasm> so, atm, i'm just waiting it to die miserably
[21:57:27] <dasm> for now, i just keep it on, it restarts itself, after 1, 2, 3 times, usually it's ok :)
[21:57:31] <dasm> minor difficulty
[21:57:57] <prussian> cb: lold
[21:58:07] <prussian> dasm: damn.
[21:58:20] <prussian> i'm sorry. that failure pattern is quite. unique?
[21:58:29] <prussian> probably whatever logic board is on it.
[21:58:40] <manicennui> I have "Dell Gaming S2716DGR 27.0" Screen LED-Lit Monitor with G-SYNC". I bought it in 2017 and have had no problems with it.
[21:59:42] <dasm> every now and then someone mentions about the same problem on reddit. i think that's just how it is.
[21:59:42] <manicennui> I'd probably look at another Dell if I needed another monitor.
[21:59:44] <dasm> /¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:00:13] <manicennui> This looks pretty good: https://www.amazon.com/Dell-U2720QM-UltraSharp-Ultra-Thin-DisplayPort/dp/B08F5J8S6Y?ref_=ast_sto_dp

[22:02:15] <manicennui> I don't know how realistic 4k at 120Hz is without spending a fuckton of money.
[22:02:34] <prussian> b-but the amazon info says the refresh rate is 1hz
[22:02:39] <prussian> one frame per second
[22:02:59] <dasm> it's worse than ppt :D
[22:03:06] <manicennui> Current monitor is 2560 x 1440 at 144Hz, which is fine with me.
[22:03:23] <manicennui> prussian: Yeah, had to look at the questions to get the actual rate.

[22:04:13] <dasm> <3
[22:04:16] <prussian> that would be silly
[22:04:20] <prussian> it's so old
[22:04:32] <manicennui> 2560x1440 is basically the point at which I stop caring about having more.
[22:04:44] <dasm> why? it would be like with cars: https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a37001912/2023-ford-bronco-raptor/

[22:05:23] <prussian> what is with this boxy crap
[22:05:24] <prussian> man
[22:05:33] <dasm> it's stealth
[22:05:39] <prussian> everyone has to rip off those land rovers and that mercedes suv i see everywhere in LA
[22:05:40] <dasm> like Snake
[22:05:44] <manicennui> Boxy Broncos look great.
[22:06:19] <manicennui> I'd love to have a classic Bronco.
[22:06:44] <prussian> just looks like another G-Wagon as far as the camo lets you see.
[22:06:45] <manicennui> Most cars look like shit now.

[22:07:32] <manicennui> It looks a lot like the current Broncos: https://www.ford.com/suvs/bronco/?intcmp=brncobrand-learnmore-reveal-bronco
[22:07:34] <prussian> you can basically hop speed bumps in it

[22:08:16] <prussian> ya...
[22:08:23] <prussian> manicennui: I kind of like the 2 door one a bit
[22:08:31] <prussian> reminds me of a 98 wrangler I had.
[22:08:31] <manicennui> Yeah, I prefer the 2-door.
[22:08:39] <dasm> i bought a jeep wrangler, lifted, bigger tires. it goes places.
[22:08:42] <prussian> the 4door looks like a stupid land rover rip
[22:08:43] <prussian> hate it
[22:08:48] <prussian> dasm: ya
[22:08:49] <prussian> lol

[22:09:14] <dasm> manicennui: "Mall Rated"
[22:09:19] <prussian> so true
[22:09:23] <manicennui> I want to see some new Broncos with custom paint jobs.
[22:09:29] <manicennui> The factory colors are pretty boring.
[22:09:40] <manicennui> dasm: Broncos are the real deal.
[22:09:44] <manicennui> Despite how people will use them.

[22:10:09] <prussian> BRONCO RAPTOR BRO
[22:10:23] <prussian> I just want a something raptor becuase it sounds so ridiculous
[22:10:26] <companion_cube> IMMA SOLDIER
[22:10:33] <prussian> F-150 Raptors are crazy
[22:10:35] <companion_cube> can it open doors?
[22:10:36] <dasm> it reminds me about: https://www.reddit.com/r/heep/
[22:10:37] <manicennui> prussian: The trucks are ridiculous.
[22:10:37] <buttsbot> Heeps of garbage
[22:10:41] <manicennui> Watch some videos of them.
[22:11:22] <prussian> I'm always like. damn that would be cool to hav- and then realize I have no need for factor 450hp super beast truck that costs almost $70k base
[22:11:39] <prussian> can't have nice things ig
[22:11:54] <dasm> just start yt channel :D
[22:11:59] <manicennui> What is the even more ridiculous custom Raptor?
[22:11:59] <prussian> ya, right?
[22:12:06] <bkero> All the NVH of a $20k vehicle in a $70k vehicle
[22:12:19] <companion_cube> https://i.imgur.com/XqBwddw.jpg :DDDDDDD
[22:12:24] <prussian> manicennui: i'm sure if you hit it hard enough you could make a raptor insane.
[22:12:33] <manicennui> There is one that is basically like a Baja racing truck.
[22:13:05] <prussian> sounds about right.
[22:13:45] <prussian> my dad was able to get about 600hp out of an inline 4 Lancer Evo IV engine
[22:14:38] <bkero> That is a good engine.

[22:20:27] <prussian> the current Chrysler ownership ones? probably. hard to say
[22:20:39] <bkero> not hard to say
[22:20:45] <bkero> just look at reports
[22:20:53] <prussian> never owned one older than ~2000

[22:24:23] <manicennui> MOPARs have been garbage for a long time, but certain Wranglers are a bit better.
[22:25:00] <manicennui> Frankly, all US cars have been garbage until the last 5 years or so.
[22:25:55] <manicennui> When I was growing up my mother's family only bought GMs, and mostly Chevies, for the longest time.
[22:25:59] <prussian> bkero: nooooo but the raptor looks so cool
[22:26:13] <manicennui> And I thought it was normal that after you bought a car, you went back to the dealer with a list of 15 things that were wrong with it for them to fix.
[22:26:23] <prussian> lol
[22:26:24] <manicennui> Then I bought a Maxima in 2000 and realized how amazing a car could be.
[22:26:50] <prussian> stupid sleet made me wreck my 2003 Camry. R.I.P.
[22:27:24] <manicennui> Nissan's 3.0/3.5L V6 was a great engine.

[22:27:35] <gwozniak> We have a Corolla and it's been pretty good for 10 years now
[22:28:18] <manicennui> Sounds like Nissan's next Z might be pretty good.
[22:28:23] <bkero> Note that Tesla isn't listed because they don't let owners report on that.
[22:28:31] <bkero> but when they unofficially got listed last year it was dead last.
[22:29:33] <manicennui> If their reliability was great, they wouldn't mind people reporting it.
[22:30:05] <manicennui> I remember them promoting the hell out of some crash test that some model did well on.
[22:30:27] <companion_cube> it's just like their stupid statistics about Autopilot being safer
[22:30:47] <companion_cube> not mentionning that it's mostly used on highways and good weather 🙄
[22:31:16] <manicennui> Basically can't be used in the rain and snow, can it?
[22:32:00] <bkero> Unfortunately good crash test ratings are not the entire measure of a vehicle.
[22:32:20] <manicennui> I like to crash all my vehicles.
[22:32:41] <cb> you sound like my buddy who 1. only buys 80s benz convertibles ("cokeboats")
[22:32:49] <cb> 2. crashes them by not knowing how to drive them in the rain

[22:33:10] <cb> my buddy
[22:33:16] <cb> you don't know him
[22:33:19] <manicennui> Who sounds like your buddy?
[22:33:27] <dasm> i thought my car would last me forever (maybe not forever, but for a long time). but then, someone didn't apply breaks and crashed into my back on intersection. my car -- total loss, damaged undercarriage. his car -- not even a scratch :D
[22:33:31] <manicennui> I was joking about crashing my vehicles.
[22:33:47] <prussian> I'm sorry.
[22:33:49] <prussian> that sucks
[22:34:01] <companion_cube> manicennui: it's supposed to be used in california when you have too much startup money
[22:34:18] <cb> manicennui: when you crash your cars
[22:34:21] <dasm> companion_cube: haha. sounds like tesla's owner :D
[22:34:32] <companion_cube> I don't own a car 💪
[22:34:35] <companion_cube> I just drive my SO's
[22:34:45] <manicennui> During the dotcom boom a friend and I joked about getting some VC money to run a company into the ground.
[22:34:46] <prussian> ^ real hero
[22:34:50] <prussian> oops
[22:34:53] <manicennui> I haven't had a car for 14 years.
[22:35:08] <manicennui> Also don't have an SO with a car.
[22:35:17] <prussian> manicennui: you can do a wework and have a private jet and everything
[22:35:23] <prussian> and have some PE or bank buy you
[22:35:34] <companion_cube> to pull a wework off
[22:35:39] <prussian> wonder the legalities of all that is like
[22:35:41] <companion_cube> you need an absurdly large ego
[22:35:46] <companion_cube> and a hefty dose of paranoia
[22:35:59] <manicennui> The key thing to realize about the US is that everything is designed to allow those with capital to gain more capital.
[22:36:05] <manicennui> So getting funded once would be huge.
[22:36:16] <manicennui> Just figure out a way to extract as much money as possible from the company.
[22:36:38] <manicennui> Pay yourself as much as possible and expense as much as possible.
[22:36:49] <manicennui> Build connections for the next scam.
[22:37:03] <manicennui> Get government loans and pay out bonuses.
[22:37:05] <manicennui> So many options.
[22:37:08] <prussian> works til it doesn't though.
[22:37:12] <prussian> unfortunately
[22:37:21] <manicennui> It has been working for centuries.
[22:37:51] <manicennui> Once you have enough capital, there are countless options to turn it into more capital by exploiting others.
[22:37:54] <manicennui> And the government.
[22:38:00] <manicennui> Look at the PPP loans.
[22:38:03] <manicennui> Huge fucking scam.
[22:38:57] <prussian> l true I guess.
[22:39:10] <manicennui> In almost every endeavor, the people who make the most money are the people with the capital, not the people who had the idea, did the work, or anything else.
[22:39:23] <manicennui> The entire entertainment industry is designed this way.
[22:39:31] <manicennui> Studios make most of the money and do almost none of the work.
[22:39:37] <manicennui> They just have money.
[22:39:57] <manicennui> Arguably some of the tech startups are counterexamples.
[22:40:12] <manicennui> But many founders still get screwed by those with capital.
[22:40:13] <prussian> the money must flow
[22:40:56] <prussian> in defense of studios, they got a lot of employees and a lot of people go into those stars.
[22:42:14] <manicennui> Most of them play shady accounting games to get a lot of that money back.
[22:42:29] <manicennui> Hire lots of subcontractors that just happen to be owned by the studio.
[22:42:44] <manicennui> That's how they get around paying out royalties and such.
[22:42:48] <manicennui> "It didn't make any money."
[22:43:40] <manicennui> In the end, the people who have the capital almost always make the most money.
[22:44:45] <manicennui> Not that I feel bad for well-paid Hollywood actors, but a large chunk of their salaries is paid to various people too.
[22:47:06] <prussian> nice.
[22:47:07] <prussian> nice
[22:47:18] <prussian> good rackets
[22:47:58] <prussian> true... doesn't help all the venues they'd go on tour to are basically vertically integrated with the whole industry.
[22:48:06] <manicennui> The people who get shafted the most seem to be writers, both of the script and the source material.
[22:48:44] <manicennui> Very uncommon for writers to get any kind of royalties for movies and TV.
[22:48:55] <manicennui> Seems common for songwriters though.
[22:49:06] <manicennui> After shady studio accounting of course.
[22:50:06] <manicennui> Books seems a bit better, but if you aren't a famous author, you are probably doing your own promotion.
[22:50:18] <prussian> sounds like we need another writer strike
[22:51:02] <manicennui> The problem for writers is that they can make okay money for the work itself, but the work isn't consistent.
[22:51:20] <manicennui> The people in control of the capital decide what gets made.
[22:51:47] <manicennui> And selling just one script might require writing half a dozen that never go anywhere.
[22:52:11] <manicennui> And because it is uncommon to get any kind of royalties, the one script they sell has to support them for a while.
[22:53:21] <manicennui> Same with book authors who sell the rights to their work.
[22:53:59] <manicennui> Unless you are like J.K. Rowling, good luck getting a cut of the gross (there is almost never any net).
[22:54:41] <manicennui> The people who are able to get a cut of the gross are almost always already rich.
[22:55:03] <prussian> fair ig
[22:55:07] <prussian> good and true points
[22:56:11] <manicennui> The Internet doesn't seem to have done much to fix any of this, other than in books to some extent, and arguably things like YT have replaced a small amount of other entertainment.
[22:57:00] <manicennui> It's interesting to look at who is doing well on Patreon.
[22:57:31] <manicennui> https://graphtreon.com/top-patreon-creators
[22:57:32] <buttsbot> Top Patreon Creators: Top Earners + Biggest + Highest Paid + Successful
[22:57:54] <manicennui> Oh, podcasts are arguably disrupting radio a bit too.
[22:58:07] <bkero> Self-publishing is a lot easier now than it was before.
[22:58:10] <bkero> and more viable
[22:58:34] <manicennui> bkero: Sure, but it's still better in many cases to sign a book deal with a major publisher if your self-publishing does well.
[22:58:46] <bkero> Eventually. That's step 2.
[22:59:07] <bkero> Not everybody is Chuck Tingle though.
[22:59:38] <manicennui> https://graphtreon.com/top-patreon-creators/writing
[22:59:39] <buttsbot> Top Patreon Writing: Top Earners + Biggest + Highest Paid + Successful
[22:59:57] <manicennui> Obviously that's not an exhaustive list of people doing well self-publishing.
[23:00:18] <manicennui> Some of these are likely *way* more than they'd make with traditional publishing.
[23:00:33] <manicennui> Like Shirtaloon making $30k per month.
[23:01:18] <manicennui> Hard to factor in how many people don't make a lot writing because they aren't actually very good at it.
[23:03:29] <manicennui> I'm not sure what the answer is for movies.
[23:03:44] <manicennui> I have a small amount of stock in Legion M, which is basically a crowdfunded entertainment company.
[23:05:59] <manicennui> Interesting that N.K. Jemisin is making about $5k per month from patreon, which is probably slightly above average income for a writer, but she is also a best seller in the traditional publishing world.
[23:07:29] <cb> 5k a month is like ~60k
[23:07:39] <cb> not fancy but it allows you to live a comfortable middle class existence
[23:08:07] *** Joins: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost)
[23:08:12] <manicennui> Yeah, I just find it interesting because she likely makes way more from traditional publishing.
[23:08:19] <manicennui> So the $60k is just a bonus for her.
[23:08:23] <cb> well yeah the traditional publish is a nice bonus
[23:08:42] <manicennui> Think she is doing some screenwriting now too.
[23:09:07] <manicennui> In October 2020, Jemisin was announced as a recipient of the MacArthur Fellows Program Genius Grant.[5]
[23:09:12] <manicennui> Think that pays too.
[23:09:27] <manicennui> "The current prize is $625,000 paid over five years in quarterly installments."
[23:09:42] <manicennui> I'm super jealous of people like this.
[23:09:49] *** Quits: river (~river@tilde.team/user/river) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:09:55] *** Quits: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost) (Client Quit)
[23:09:59] <manicennui> Not because she is likely rich, but because she is probably doing something she loves and getting paid well for it.
[23:10:03] <manicennui> And it's not a 9 to 5.
[23:10:18] <manicennui> "In June 2021, Sony's TriStar Pictures won the rights to adapt The Broken Earth trilogy in a seven-figure deal with Jemisin adapting the novels for the screen herself.[27]"
[23:11:16] <manicennui> "Jemisin's debut novel, The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, the first volume in her Inheritance Trilogy, was published in 2010."
[23:11:24] <manicennui> 11 years to go from debut novel to rich.
[23:11:40] *** Joins: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost)
[23:11:45] <manicennui> I have some of her books on my ridiculous list of things to read, but I don't know when I'll get to them.
[23:13:12] *** Quits: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost) (Client Quit)
[23:17:53] <manicennui> "In May 2016, Jemisin mounted a Patreon campaign which raised sufficient funding to allow her to quit her job as a counseling psychologist and focus full-time on her writing.[21]"
[23:18:06] <manicennui> Wow. So she has only been fully supported by her writing for 5 years.
[23:21:56] <bkero> Broken Earth has been on my list of to-read for a while.
[23:22:07] <bkero> Maybe after Murderbot.
[23:22:51] <manicennui> Murderbot is on my list too.
[23:23:15] <bkero> The audiobook is only 3 hours
[23:23:21] <bkero> I imagine the novel must be like 200 pages.
[23:23:28] <manicennui> I've been strongly considering not watching any more television series so I can make a dent in my reading list.
[23:24:28] <manicennui> But I also want to watch several anime series. =/
[23:24:44] <manicennui> I think the solution is to quit this job thing that is taking up so much of my time.
[23:25:01] <prussian> so true.
[23:25:23] <prussian> i don't even know what I'm doing anymore.
[23:25:26] <prussian> work wise
[23:25:39] <manicennui> What do you mean?
[23:25:55] <prussian> like, what I'm doing at work lol
[23:26:08] <manicennui> Too technically challenging or?
[23:26:30] <manicennui> I've gotten to a point where I put in the minimum amount of effort and thought while still being paid well.
[23:26:35] <prussian> technically challeneging? I guess. socially is perhaps more apt.
[23:26:42] <manicennui> Ah.
[23:26:48] <prussian> ig depends where we want to put the technical problem on
[23:27:26] <prussian> ugh. the factory ended up shipping a ton of product that had knwon broken sd cards and they were all sitting in a warehouse (thankfully)
[23:27:46] <prussian> and it's just too much dealing with factory and what "we" as in software need.
[23:27:46] <manicennui> I just want the ability to have more impact on my compensation at this point.
[23:27:52] <manicennui> Which probably means working for myself.
[23:28:10] <prussian> faang up no?
[23:28:15] <manicennui> Nah.
[23:29:06] <manicennui> You are never going to be paid anything close to what your impact is on the bottom line while working for someone else.
[23:29:28] <prussian> startup is hard though.
[23:29:43] <manicennui> Yeah, I probably won't go that route.
[23:29:59] <manicennui> I want to find something I can make and make money on for years.
[23:30:07] <manicennui> But not necessarily software.
[23:30:34] <manicennui> My plan is to be done with software by 55 at the latest.
[23:31:02] <manicennui> Might even do something totally different like vacation rentals or something.
[23:34:44] <prussian> damn
[23:34:45] <prussian> gl
[23:35:28] <manicennui> Gotta turn my capital into more capital!
[23:37:32] <prussian> rat race
[23:37:41] <prussian> privatized retirement and all.
[23:38:11] <manicennui> I don't even want to retire exactly.
[23:38:19] <manicennui> I just don't want to work a 9 to 5 for someone else.
[23:38:56] <manicennui> I think 4-6 hours per day, 4-5 days per week, and not at set times is about as much as I would work though.
[23:39:19] <manicennui> Or maybe fewer hours per day more days per week.
[23:40:19] <manicennui> Also want to deal with the corporate world as little as possible.
[23:43:33] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[23:48:32] <prussian> idk what I want to do lol
[23:48:36] <prussian> everything is a mess.
[23:48:57] <prussian> told mentee I don't want to mentor. wonder if he will be sad face emoji if I just quit.
[23:49:00] <manicennui> Just focus on putting yourself in a good position if you do find out.
