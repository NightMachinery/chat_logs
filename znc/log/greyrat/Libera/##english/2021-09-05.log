[18:36:37] <CuriosTiger> I'm having trouble parsing that sentence. What's "who" referring back to? The truly convinced and strong person, or their parents and teachers?
[18:37:02] *** Joins: pntaylor (~quassel@2405:6e00:489:f39::2)
[18:37:25] <StayHungry> parents and teachers
[18:37:43] <CuriosTiger> Parents and teachers don't really group logically with "one's dignity". Is it talking about one's own dignity AND that of parents and teachers, or are the parents and teachers being listed as sources of strength and conviction along with one's own dignity.
[18:38:30] <CuriosTiger> I presume "an agent of betterment" is supposed to be something or someone who is helping the person "better" themselves, but why is that needed if they are "convinced" (of what?) and strong to begin with?
[18:39:47] <CuriosTiger> and a "cogent" conversationalist is an odd choice of adjectives. I'd probably look at something like "competent" instead. At least in my use, it's arguments, rather than people who should be cogent, although I can see a cogent argument (see what I did there) being made for both.
[18:41:39] <CuriosTiger> All in all, this paragraph strikes me as an example of someone trying to use language that is too sophisticated for their skill level.

[19:03:06] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: 'why is that needed if they are "convinced" (of what?) and strong to begin with?' One could argue that Mahatma Gandhi was a truly convinced and strong agent of betterment.
[19:04:54] <CuriosTiger> I'd agree that he was a "strong agent of betterment" (or as I would put it, "he made the world a better place"). And I'll also agree he held his views on non-violence with strong conviction. But I still find the phrasing strange.

[23:04:07] <dTal> True, but the line "<chuckles> I'm in danger!" is Ralph
[23:04:10] <blkshp> How very cromulant.
[23:04:18] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Did you consult on Star Trek:First Contact, by any chance?
[23:04:25] <CuriosTiger> *cromulent
[23:04:33] <blkshp> Damn it.
[23:04:36] <CuriosTiger> dTal: That it is.
[23:04:37] <blkshp> CuriosTiger: I did!
[23:04:51] <blkshp> But only for 0.68 seconds.
[23:05:03] <CuriosTiger> so that's where they got the Borg-dissolving apple juice from.
[23:06:19] <blkshp> I'm a horrible person, someone I used to work with on facebook has uploaded a picture of his family visit to the 9/11 Naval memoral where I lived as a child. My first thought "That's not how the navy salute"
[23:06:44] <pussipupu> Ralph is in the famous "*giggles* I'm in danger" meme
[23:07:07] <pussipupu> Finns salute like Americans and it's terrible
[23:07:21] <blkshp> So do the Royal Navy.
[23:07:57] <huf> I dont know how anyone salutes :D I'm vaguely aware there are different styles but none of them seem to matter to me
[23:08:47] <blkshp> I am aware of some Military protocol in the UK and US.
[23:09:28] <huf> well, I know the nazi salute :D
[23:09:31] <huf> I care about that one
[23:10:09] <pussipupu> https://images.app.goo.gl/dF5dWKi5b1m4nkfbA
[23:10:13] <blkshp> The Nazi salute was originally the same as the Rotal Navy
[23:10:29] <blkshp> I believe Hitler decided it was not sufficient and implemented the new one.
[23:10:55] <blkshp> Arnold Arnold Arnold RRRRimmer.
[23:11:09] <pussipupu> Which is weirdly derived from the Roman slave salute
[23:11:44] <CuriosTiger> It's probably not easy to come up with an original salute.
[23:11:53] <huf> oh it is
[23:12:06] <huf> but for some reason nobody picks butt slapping
[23:12:09] <huf> or facepalming
[23:12:26] <huf> or reaching back behind you, between your legs and waving
[23:12:28] <CuriosTiger> You want something that is easy, recognizable and can be seen from a distance. And, to counter your last suggestions, dignified.
[23:12:40] <huf> there's nothing dignified about military service
[23:12:45] <huf> so that's just nonsense
[23:13:07] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: deus ex Hungariā (ablative of Hungariă)
[23:13:08] <CuriosTiger> so what you're saying is the military does not care about appearance?
[23:13:16] <pussipupu> Pouring lead down the barrel of a gun
[23:13:18] <huf> CuriosTiger: oh they do, but they're not dignified
[23:13:25] <pussipupu> ultimate dignity salute
[23:13:30] <huf> it's just sad
[23:14:00] <dTal> I think butt slapping is used in some cultures
[23:14:05] <dTal> like baseball
[23:14:11] <huf> :)
[23:14:51] <CuriosTiger> huf: I'm a pacifist, but I don't think it a stretch to claim that dignity is hugely important in the military. At the very least, the appearance of dignity.

[23:15:36] <huf> uniforms used to look like clown suits man
[23:15:39] <CuriosTiger> The veneer probably disappears when you're out there on the battlefield slaughtering the enemy, but that's a different conversation.
[23:15:43] <huf> now they just look like warehouse workers or something
[23:16:38] <CuriosTiger> *shrug* This is getting into an opinion debate, which is pointless.
[23:16:58] <huf> but of course
[23:17:22] <CuriosTiger> Suffice it to say I believe dignity, or the appearance of such, is hugely important to military leaders in general, and that you're free to disagree.
[23:17:58] <StayHungry> no military, no sovereignty :)
[23:18:19] <CuriosTiger> Costa Rica and Iceland might disagree.
[23:18:39] <CuriosTiger> but it's true that in general, you need some way of protecting yourself from invasion, because people suck.
[23:19:05] <CuriosTiger> of course, once you build that force, it's easy to come up with reasons to use it to invade others.
[23:19:20] <CuriosTiger> and that's human history for you in a nutshell.
[23:19:37] <huf> a bit of preemptive defence
[23:20:05] *** Quits: APic (apic@apic.name) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:20:14] <CuriosTiger> Sure. Or a magnanimous act of protecting the freedoms of some people in some places, as long as it lines up with what you want.
[23:20:18] <CuriosTiger> Team America World Police.
[23:20:26] <StayHungry> :D
[23:20:41] <CuriosTiger> Or perhaps you're just trying to make sure the heathens go to heaven.
[23:20:54] <CuriosTiger> or whichever Paradise your particular religion believes in, because surely, there can be only one.
[23:21:18] <CuriosTiger> You could even save the slaves from having to run around free in Africa, because they might fight wars there
[23:21:24] <CuriosTiger> they're much better off on a plantation
[23:21:45] * CuriosTiger decides to stop.
[23:23:36] <StayHungry> with all due respect to Iceland and almost all countries with weapons, sovereign countries can be counted on the fingers
[23:24:13] <huf> now you're just conflating powers with sovereignity
[23:24:18] <StayHungry> America, China, Russia… then it becomes murky
[23:24:22] <LuisP14> you with your unpronouncing -ent as -ant .. :>
