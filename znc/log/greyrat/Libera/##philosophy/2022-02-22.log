[06:06:14] <Irishmanluke> Do you ever go to Barne's and Noble and look at the philosophy section?
[06:06:21] <Irishmanluke> It makes me sad
[06:06:30] <absentia> The Secret
[06:06:37] <Irishmanluke> It's very small and most of it is pop bs
[06:10:57] * Delf would never
[06:11:48] <Irishmanluke> science and math sections are similar
[06:12:15] <Irishmanluke> although science and math also includes study materials for helping you pass a specific test
[06:12:31] <Irishmanluke> which is just as sad
[06:13:05] <absentia> goodhart's law has reached comical levels in education
[06:20:55] <causative_> nah testing is good in education, otherwise you'd have no way to compare bad schools to good ones or motivate bad schools to become better
[06:21:45] <causative_> teachers lose some freedom to set their curricula but that can be a good thing, if it stops them from dumbing it down
[06:21:58] <causative_> grade inflation is real
[06:23:19] <causative_> if every school hands out A's for mediocre students, and you come from a mediocre high school, then testing is the only way colleges can ever see you're a good student
[06:24:08] <absentia> in my experience most people were not interested in the learning for its own sake, merely the numerical certification
[06:24:25] <absentia> and numerically, they were almost indistinguishable from those who had a genuine interest and motivation to deeply understand what they were studying
[06:24:33] <absentia> somehow this feels wrong
[06:24:37] <causative_> better to have the be interested in the certification than not interested at all
[06:25:36] <causative_> also if the people interested in the certification were numerically indistinguishable from those with a genuine interest, then perhaps the interest wasn't so genuine
[06:26:09] <causative_> you'd expect that someone with a genuine interest would spend a lot more time and effort on the subject and this would show up in test scores
[06:26:35] <absentia> there is a point of diminishing returns at the long tail
[06:26:47] <absentia> diminishing returns in terms of impact on your numerical score on some assessment
[06:26:53] <absentia> perhaps not to knowledge gained
[06:26:56] <causative_> maybe they were only saying they had a genuine interest to make themselves look good
[06:27:07] <absentia> mmh, doubtful
[06:27:14] <absentia> you see when someone is obsessed
[06:27:49] <causative_> are you speaking from the perspective of a teacher or a fellow student?
[06:28:22] <absentia> as a student i was surrounded by people only interested in copying answers, or skipping class and using someone else's lecture notes
[06:28:34] <absentia> they all achieved quite highly
[06:28:39] <absentia> and this is not some backwoods institution
[06:28:56] <absentia> but i would be hard pressed to say any of them actually gave a shit about what they were learning
[06:29:04] <absentia> to the contrary - they moaned about it on the regular
[06:29:36] <Delf> causative_: Some people just suck shit, despite having genuine interest. I'm sure you can imagine it
[06:30:20] <absentia> imagine equating low scores to "sucking shit"
[06:30:29] <causative_> I mean...
[06:30:33] <absentia> this is precisely the sort of thing i am referring to
[06:31:05] <causative_> well, I've always done well on tests and I've usually had interest
[06:31:11] <absentia> Delf: I suppose you also consider the worth of a researcher on their publication count?
[06:31:17] <Delf> Why even imagine? I'm a good example myself. I have genuine interest in fields I suck shit at
[06:31:51] <causative_> if someone isn't doing well on tests then either they don't care as much as they seem to care, or they're not that smart

[06:34:08] <causative_> but really I think that if someone *really* cares, they will think about the subject day and night and really get it in a way others won't
[06:34:14] <causative_> and there's no way for that *not* to show up on tests

[06:35:03] <absentia> another way of stating this is that the false positive rate is too high
[06:35:28] <absentia> people gaming assessments instead of learning material
[06:35:59] <causative_> unless they're actually cheating, they have to be learning the material to pass the test
[06:36:56] <causative_> unless the test is just too easy
[06:36:59] <Irishmanluke> I agree with Absentia, maybe the false negative right is low but the false positive rate is high
[06:37:28] <causative_> then what you really object to is easy tests, not tests in general
[06:37:42] <Irishmanluke> And both of those are to some extent a function of tests being too easy
[06:37:52] <Delf> causative_: Unless tests in general are easy tests!

[06:39:34] <Irishmanluke> well we're talking about course tests here not IQ tests

[06:39:55] <absentia> an entire space dedicated to solving artificial problems
[06:40:00] <causative_> well, I'm greatly skeptical of soft, social ways of evaluating how much someone knows about a subject
[06:40:12] <Irishmanluke> assuming that because the output of the test is quantitative that that means it's objective is silly
[06:40:28] <causative_> too easily gamed by being charismatic and repeating the "good" opinions
[06:40:32] <absentia> lol
[06:40:38] <absentia> and philosophy is free of this?
[06:40:44] <absentia> what can philosophers "actually do"
[06:41:02] <causative_> without an objective, external way of measuring, social dynamics get all out of sync with the actual facts
[06:41:16] <causative_> yes, philosophy has a problem with it
[06:41:56] <Irishmanluke> why would you assume that in general a test that some random teacher created is "measuring" some "fact"
[06:42:09] <Irishmanluke> how are you validating this measure
[06:42:33] <causative_> because the test is going to ask the students to repeat or apply some facts
[06:42:44] <absentia> we can make GPT-3 do that now
[06:43:04] <Irishmanluke> well first of all there's often an extent to which the correct answer can be inferred
[06:43:05] <absentia> congrats, we've solved testing
[06:43:07] <causative_> we can kinda, but not really absentia
[06:43:08] <absentia> everybody go home
[06:43:30] <absentia> ah wait we're already here
[06:43:34] <absentia> better go take my online test while i'm here
[06:43:48] <Irishmanluke> secondly there's a question of whether the questions on the test are testing for a comprehensive set of things that are core to the curriculum
[06:43:55] <causative_> that would be a problem with "too easy" testing rather than testing at all, Irishmanluke
[06:44:18] <absentia> maybe watch some youtube^H^H^H^H^H^H^H lecture videos before hand
[06:44:26] <causative_> ("inferring" the correct anser, I mean)
[06:44:31] <Irishmanluke> well not exactly because sometimes you have to be smart in order to correctly infer the answer
[06:44:45] <Irishmanluke> so in that sense it might not be easy
[06:44:56] <causative_> well, then that's a demonstrable capability of the student to handle the subject
[06:45:16] <causative_> it's better to figure things out than to rote memorize
[06:45:18] <Irishmanluke> no it demonestrates the capability of the student to outwit the teacher
[06:45:37] <absentia> causative_: so to the extent GPT-3 performs well on a test, it demonstrates capability to handle the subject?
[06:46:06] <causative_> absentia, depends on what you mean by "handle" the subject
[06:46:12] <absentia> causative_: in the same sense you meant it
[06:46:24] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[06:46:54] <causative_> it does demonstrate some competency in respect to the subject, namely the capacity to correctly answer questions about the subject
[06:47:11] <causative_> in a similar way that IBM watson demonstrated competency at Jeopardy
[06:47:14] <Delf> causative_: This is true. You have no idea how many people has said that I'm very smart just because they like me
[06:47:35] <absentia> causative_: would you grant certification to GPT-3, were it able to pass a test
[06:48:01] <causative_> naturally we would expect that if gpt3 does well on a test, it would be missing a range of related abilities that we would expect from a human with the same performance
[06:48:09] <causative_> so I wouldn't say it should be granted a human certification
[06:48:31] <causative_> but really gpt3 cannot pass most tests
[06:48:34] <absentia> causative_: what if we delegated those abilities to a human and merely had them operate GPT-3 for all the cognitive tasks
[06:48:44] <absentia> could we then just abolish education
[06:48:53] <causative_> no, because gpt3 is not good enough
[06:48:59] <causative_> you'd need an AGI for that to work
[06:49:00] <absentia> so it's merely a matter of technological advancement
[06:49:02] <causative_> which gpt3 is not
[06:49:55] <causative_> it's also a question of what kind of society is desirable - if it becomes technically possible for humans to do nothing but be hands and eyes for their robot supervisors, do we want that kind of world?
[06:50:18] <causative_> from an economic perspective it would be fine, better even, but people wouldn't know as much or be as much "people"
[06:50:42] <Delf> We wouldn't want it now. But when it's too late, we would want it because the alternative would be far worse
[06:50:51] <absentia> the point of me bringing that up was to illustrate how performance on a test may not necessarily correlate well to one's "comprehension" of a subject
[06:50:54] <absentia> or ability to apply its knowledge
[06:51:11] <causative_> well, to perform in a mediocre way on certain tests can be done without comprehension
[06:51:17] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:51:20] <absentia> enough to gain certification
[06:51:20] <causative_> but to excel is going to require comprehension
[06:51:44] <causative_> it depends on what kind of certification you're talking about
[06:52:04] <absentia> well, GPT-3 has been able to get published
[06:52:18] <absentia> have its cognitive output accepted by certified researchers and experts in their field of study
[06:52:52] <causative_> this is somewhat overstating the capabilities of gpt3
[06:53:19] <causative_> like saying that a dog became a successful artist (when the human put the brush in its mouth with paint, and trained it)
[06:53:32] <causative_> gpt3 is not creating interesting academic works
[06:54:01] <causative_> it's creating sort of dreamlike stream of thought associations

[06:54:45] <absentia> maybe it wasn't actually a paper
[06:55:04] <absentia> or maybe just a portion of a paper
[06:55:07] <absentia> why can i not find this
[06:59:19] <causative_> I would trust a test result over a glowing review from a teacher - good reviews come from playing the social game (and maybe knowing the subject too), test results come from knowing the subject
[07:00:27] <causative_> or what if the teacher gives nothing *but* glowing reviews?
[07:00:40] <causative_> a standardized test is going to cut through that BS
[07:00:53] <absentia> yes because students have never sucked up to their prof all term for an extension on their paper
[07:01:07] <absentia> that may have been worth 20% of their final grade
[07:01:22] <causative_> I would trust a standardized test result over a final grade
[07:03:31] <causative_> of course we have to make sure the test cannot be gamed and is hard enough to show the full range of abilities
[07:03:42] <causative_> so that only the best of the best score near the top
[07:03:51] <causative_> but most standardized tests do that anyway
[07:04:26] <causative_> like the SAT, MCAT, LSAT, GMAT
[07:05:01] <absentia> ok so all other numerical assessments are garbage?
[07:05:13] <causative_> depends on the assessment
[07:05:18] <causative_> lots of assessments are garbage

[07:05:43] <absentia> seems to have been my original point - "when people start chasing a metric, it ceases to be a good measure"
[07:05:55] <absentia> which i think we have concluded applies to lots of assessments
[07:06:30] <causative_> well, that's true, but it's less of a problem in education than in other areas, because all the students are learning the same material
[07:06:53] <causative_> it's much more of a problem with e.g. software developers, because every developer is doing something completely different from every other

[07:07:53] <causative_> but subjective social approval is a metric too, and quite a bad one
[07:08:33] <causative_> you can't avoid metrics, the best you can do is make them as good as you can
[07:10:10] <causative_> and you will expect that they will cease to be as good once people start chasing them, but there's no way around it - just keep making the metric better
[07:10:47] <causative_> you're always using a metric even if that metric is "I like this guy"

[10:50:21] <xx> uh, the typical division between eastern and western style of thought
[10:51:25] <p0indexter> nonsense...you see...since airplanes and internet there is no reasl difference only superficial ones
[10:51:28] <xx> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_dichotomy though perhaps that one is more asia vs not-asia
[10:51:28] <ro-bot-o> [url] East–West dichotomy - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[10:51:57] <xx> there definitely is a difference along the lines of collectivist vs individualist style of life
[10:52:32] <trbp> but i guess that difference is not bound to regions anymore, is it?
[10:52:35] <p0indexter> therre is more projecting then than difference
[10:52:47] <xx> trbp: probably doesn't follow exact borders, no
[10:53:12] <xx> but I'd still claim that e.g. western europe has more of an individualist approach compared to the collectivist approach of eastern europe
[10:53:14] <trbp> projection and abstraction is not taught, even to those with diplomas ;)
[10:53:26] <trbp> only stupid worker bees are needed ;)
[10:55:03] <trbp> xx, we could histroically think such things, but i guess it was always more or less same
[10:55:25] <trbp> collectives where all the time good as it kept the individuals save and fed
[10:56:10] <p0indexter> if we project differences then they will occur
[10:56:12] <xx> perhaps, but it still does affect many people's thoughts
[10:56:20] <trbp> regardless of region and history if the people get uncomfortable they either emigrate or revolt
[10:56:37] <xx> e.g. slavic countries often think of each other as brothers, whereas there's no such thing among western europe
