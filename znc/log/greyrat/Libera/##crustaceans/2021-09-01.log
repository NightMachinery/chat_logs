[02:12:10] <Brekkjern> Yep
[02:13:16] <Brekkjern> Customer doesn't know how to describe what they want/need, and don't want to spend time having the devs figure it out with them because only time spent writing code is "doing something" and you end up with a shit product and nobody is happy except for the lawyers who have to deal with the lawsuits.
[02:15:19] <kline> gerikson, thats fine, but i think theres something inherently distasteful in declining evacuation that was promised to other people on their behalf
[02:17:01] <kline> starting an animal rescue charity and not a kids charity shows you care more about the animals than the kids, which is fine, but the right thing to have done was to get his 70 staff out the country and continue to wave his british passport around the animals
[02:18:16] <kline> the offer was there, he actively said "no, i wont let my staff evacuate unless you take the dogs", which i suspect is very much not what his staff would have said
[02:18:16] <Brekkjern> My initial impression of Scheme is that I don't like the amount of brackets...
[02:21:35] <goodger> Brekkjern: is that a joke?
[02:21:49] <Brekkjern> What is?
[02:22:03] <goodger> the last thing you said before that
[02:22:18] <kline> about brackets?
[02:23:14] <Brekkjern> I get that you need some way to define lists in a language defined by lists, but having to press shift + 8/9 to get the parenthasis all the time is getting somewhat annoying.
[02:23:38] <Brekkjern> Parenthesis... Whatevs...
[02:24:12] <kline> i wonder if, on average, you use the shift key any more/less in lisp than comparable languages
[02:24:24] <Brekkjern> The shift key isn't the problem
[02:24:39] <kline> sure, you're hitting () more often, but what about [],', ", *, etc
[02:24:43] <Brekkjern> Having to reach up to the number row constantly to hit the correct key is.
[02:25:13] <bontaq> you just need a lisp keyboard Brekkjern
[02:25:45] <Brekkjern> Does a lisp keyboard output "th" when you press the s key?
[02:26:02] <kline> i have a vague feeling that less, more consistent use of a small set of punctuation is probably better than C, Rust, etcs gamut of different bits
[02:26:25] <Brekkjern> I'd prefer not having to type them at all. Python FTW :P
[02:26:26] <bontaq> it has all the features, or rebind your 90 to () and really go at it
[02:26:28] <kline> id certainly say emacs or perl are probably far less ergonomic on this aspect
[02:27:08] <kline> Brekkjern, right, but python has ()[],*, etc. is this actually any easier than lots of ()?
[02:27:19] <bontaq> ah but they're you're missing out on paredit, which makes editing lisp hugely easier than pythong
[02:27:33] <kline> i imagine lisp people develop much more robust muscle memory for this than a python person does for any of his punctuation
[02:27:43] <kline> so python people probably typo symbols more often
[02:28:07] <Brekkjern> kline: Sure, but you don't need to use them around every if statement for example
[02:28:18] <kline> but you do need to use :
[02:28:30] <Brekkjern> Which is really easy to hit on my keyboard
[02:29:07] <kline> maybe, but probably more easily typod un-seen than 9( vs ;:
[02:29:39] <Brekkjern> Eh. My IDE would yell at me rather fast anyways.
[02:29:52] <kline> im willing to bet the same is true for lisp
[02:30:24] <goodger> my laptop keyboard has dedicated () keys
[02:30:35] <goodger> also, you don't need to type the )s
[02:30:45] <jjuran> In Varyx, you can omit parentheses around if/for/while conditions at the cost of having to write then/do
[02:31:00] <goodger> but I understand people often remap capslock or something to (

[02:33:11] <Brekkjern> I agree. Research there would probably be rather nice.

[02:42:04] <Brekkjern> It's optional, but still...
[02:47:46] <bontaq> cond since there's 3 options, looks every so slightly nicer

[10:22:59] <quanticle> One of the places where I agree with the OP is where he says that a lot of the hate for Electron comes from bad Electron apps. I agree. For example, both Atom and VSCode are Electron apps that do roughly the same thing: text editing. But VSCode is significantly faster and uses modestly less memory.
[11:03:26] <quanticle> So here's an interesting application of Big-O. Usually you see Big-O notation used to define upper bounds on algorithm complexity. However, I'm reading about this approximate matrix multiplication algorithm, and they're using Big-O to establish upper bounds on the amount of error.
[11:04:40] <quanticle> "Their algorithm simply samples s columns from A to form an n x s matrix A', and s rows from B to form an s x n matrix B' and finally returns A'B' as an approximate answer. If s is O(1), the running time of the algorithm is O(n^2). The algorithm is able to guarantee that the relative error can be bounded by O(1/sqrt(s)) with high probability. In fact the algorithm of Cohen and Lewis can be
[11:04:42] <quanticle> looked at as obtaining a bound of O(1/sqrt(c)), where (n^2)c samples are being used."
[11:04:44] <quanticle> https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2014/117/download/
[11:05:40] <gerikson> isn't O() just 'order of' and just what exactly the order is is dependent on the situation?
[11:05:57] <quanticle> Yep
[11:06:24] <quanticle> It's just that I think this is the first time I've seen order-of used outside of a runtime complexity context
[11:07:08] <gerikson> that's because you're parochial ;)
[11:07:11] <gerikson> j/k
[11:07:14] <quanticle> This is a neat algorithm, BTW. The error bound is O(1/sqrt(s)), where s is the number of sampled rows from A and sampled columns from B
[11:07:19] <quanticle> I am very parochial :)
[11:07:52] <quanticle> But the runtime is O(n^2), which is much faster than the exact matrix multiplication algorithm
[11:08:09] <quanticle> Which has a runtime of O(n^2.73) or something like that
[11:09:07] <gerikson> ``Ask HN: Why Bother with All This?''
[11:11:33] <quanticle> It's just such a counterintuitive algorithm to me. If you told me, "Okay, we're going to pull s random rows from A and s random columns from B and multiply them together to get an approximation from AB, with pretty decent error bounds," I'd have told you that you were daft.
[11:11:38] <quanticle> But here it is, and it works

[12:40:57] <quanticle> You can feel the late '70s ennui
[12:41:13] <gerikson> but Delany, as a Black gay, was out of the mainstream
[12:41:23] <gerikson> Herbert was deffo *in*
[12:42:02] <quanticle> Oh, by late '70s, I meant early 70s lol
[12:42:08] <quanticle> Apparently Nova was published in '68
[12:42:22] <gerikson> yeah, New Wave
[12:42:24] <quanticle> And yeah, that makes sense, because by the late-70s Gibson is already publishing cyberpunk
[12:42:56] <quanticle> Fragments of a Hologram Rose is... like '77 or '78
[12:43:11] <gerikson> Neuromancer is '84
[12:43:30] <gerikson> God-Emperor is ... '81
[12:44:04] <quanticle> Yeah, but Gibson published a lot of cyberpunk short stories before then. Burning Chrome (which coined the term 'cyberspace') came out in '82.
[12:44:24] <gerikson> I know, I've read them ;)
[12:44:36] <quanticle> So yeah, I guess _Dune_ is the last of the great "classic" space operas
[12:44:49] <gerikson> but the thing is, after Neuromancer, *everyone* was writing cyberpunk
[12:44:49] <quanticle> And then cyberpunk just owns everything
[12:44:54] <quanticle> Yeah
[12:44:57] <gerikson> quanticle: Dune is '68
[12:45:05] <quanticle> I mean the Dune series
[12:45:26] <gerikson> there's a ton of crap from Heinlein that's mostly forgotten
[12:45:30] <gerikson> ah ok
[12:45:47] <quanticle> Yeah
[12:46:10] <gerikson> then Banks arrived with "new Space Opera"
[12:46:19] <gerikson> I mean
[12:46:25] <gerikson> I kinda like Dune's universe
[12:46:32] <bkero> 'eh, not everyone was writing cyberpunk
[12:46:36] <gerikson> it's pretty cynical and realpolitik
[12:46:37] <bkero> Some did far-future not-gritty stuff
[12:46:41] <quanticle> I love the Dune universe
[12:46:50] <gerikson> bkero: it was the hot thing
[12:46:50] <quanticle> I'm 100% for a Butlerian Jihad
[12:46:56] <bkero> See also Star Trek, Niven, and Zelazny
[12:47:00] <bkero> Sure
[12:47:05] <gerikson> like singularity novels were a few years later
[12:47:15] <gerikson> and "steampunk" *blecccch*
[12:47:28] <bkero> It's just catnip
[12:47:37] <bkero> Before that it was grey goo/nanobots
[12:47:42] <gerikson> mmm
[12:47:42] <quanticle> Haha, okay real talk: are there any actual steampunk novels other than Stephenson's Baroque Cycle?
[12:47:48] <gerikson> god yes
[12:47:55] <gerikson> that's not SF
[12:47:57] <quanticle> I... I did not need to know this
[12:48:29] <gerikson> I read some horrible stuff about zombies in an alternate Portland, with Zeppelins
[12:48:56] <riv> I was wondering what the new trend is, now that singularity ai stuff is old h at
[12:49:02] <gerikson> Boing Boing was all in on zeppelins for a while
[12:49:04] <bkero> Portland has enough zombies
[12:49:26] <bkero> and Ted Wheeler has already sought to all the Zeppelins
[12:49:36] <bkero> We call them criddlers now though.
[12:49:53] <quanticle> riv: Well, there *was* a nascent trend of what I like to call "doomer SF"
[12:50:04] <quanticle> i.e. people making their way around an ecologically devastated earth
[12:50:20] <quanticle> Peter Watts wrote a lot of that. "Cyclopterus" is a good example
[12:50:21] <gerikson> I like Paolo Bagigalupi';s stuff
[12:51:05] <riv> oh interesting
[12:51:12] <quanticle> But yeah, I don't know what the newest trends are in SF.
[12:51:25] <riv> I guess people were trying to invent new kinds of punk for a while
[12:51:27] <riv> like solarpunk
[12:51:33] <riv> but nothing really took
[12:51:37] <quanticle> I'm not sure that anyone does. I feel like you can really only tell literary trends like... 20 years after the fact
[12:51:57] <quanticle> When you look back on e.g. the '90s and realize, "Oh yeah, there was a lot of cyberpunk wasn't there?"
[12:52:15] <gerikson> yeo
[12:52:16] <quanticle> Though even by the '90s, I guess cyberpunk was starting to fade.
[12:52:41] <gerikson> it's fascinating to me how "cyberpunk" has hardened into a trope
[12:52:50] <gerikson> everyone "knows" what it's like
[12:52:57] <quanticle> I mean, it's like... punk rock isn't it?
[12:53:01] <gerikson> I mean the latest game exemplifies that a lot
[12:53:04] <gerikson> quanticle: yep!
[12:53:17] <quanticle> Where it started out as pure rebellion, but now it's just as ossified and fixed as the genres it was rebelling against
[12:54:16] <gerikson> the reason it's called cyberpunk is a conscious call-back to musical punk
[12:54:40] <bkero> That's the punkt of it
[12:56:25] <gerikson> fascinating reading https://web.archive.org/web/20110719211204/http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/entc312/s05/best80.cgi

[13:57:58] <quanticle> gerikson: Wow, not just "dying", but "dead" :P
[13:59:41] <Brekkjern> Man, every Electron thread is a dumpsterfire
[14:00:08] <Brekkjern> And that rewrite thread is also fucking dumb
[14:00:10] <quanticle> Just like Electron itself
[14:00:14] <quanticle> Badumtsh
[14:00:18] <Brekkjern> Nah. It works.
[14:00:34] <quanticle> So does PHP ;)
[14:00:36] <Brekkjern> And it's mostly consistent across platforms
[14:01:01] <Brekkjern> If the only complaint about PHP was that it used too much RAM, I would agree with you on the comparison :P
[14:02:22] <gerikson> I have a theory that kvetching about Electron is a symptom of alieniation in software devs
[14:03:51] <Brekkjern> In what way?
[14:03:56] <quanticle> It's like that line from Richard Gabriel's essay: "The good news is that in 1995 we will have a good operating system and programming language; the bad news is that they will be Unix and C++." (https://dreamsongs.com/WIB.html)
[14:03:56] <buttsbot> 404 Not Found
[14:03:58] <quanticle> In 2030 we will have a good cross-platform runtime and programming language; the bad news is that they will be electron and Javascript.
[14:04:59] <quanticle> Someone needs to fix buttsbot's URL regex
[14:05:09] <Brekkjern> No. It works as designed
[14:05:17] <Brekkjern> ) is a valid part of a URL
[14:05:20] <prussian> You can't though since
[14:05:25] <prussian> Ya beat me to it
[14:05:44] <quanticle> Fine ( https://dreamsongs.com/WIB.html )
[14:05:44] <buttsbot> Worse Is Better
[14:05:50] <Brekkjern> Tadah!
[14:05:54] <Brekkjern> Works as designed ;)
[14:05:55] <prussian> Hell you can basically throw anything in it that isn't \r\n if you
[14:06:07] <gerikson> Brekkjern: you have these highly-trained craftspeople, deeply invested in software development, who are *forced* to use stuff like Slack, and this exposes the fact that their labor is basically in the service of the owners of the means of production ;)
[14:06:08] <prussian> Really try hard enoug
[14:06:23] <Brekkjern> gerikson: I agree on that one.
[14:06:38] <Brekkjern> They just need to grow up and suck it up :P
[14:06:54] <Brekkjern> Either that, or work to promote communism, but that's definitely not happening...
[14:07:17] <gerikson> ``The theoretical basis of alienation within the capitalist mode of production is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services,
[14:07:23] <gerikson> produced by their own labour.''
[14:07:34] <gerikson> TEXTBOOK
[14:07:57] <gerikson> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation
[14:07:57] <buttsbot> Marx's theory of alienation - Wikipedia
[14:08:26] <Brekkjern> Good luck getting the libertarians on HN and Lobste.rs to read anything that starts with "Marx's"
[14:08:56] <gerikson> lol
[14:09:03] <quanticle> lol
[14:09:23] <gerikson> I'm no Marxist but analysing contempory stuff in terms of "who pays the bills" is usually instructive
[14:09:32] <quanticle> idk I've found a few libertarians who were actually pretty knowledgeable about Marxist analysis
[14:09:39] <gerikson> why is Electron popular? It's a cost effective way of distributing desktop apps
[14:09:42] <gerikson> nothing more
[14:09:44] <Brekkjern> quanticle: Do they hang around on HN and the site?
[14:09:49] <quanticle> Absolutely not
[14:09:53] <Brekkjern> There you go!
[14:10:09] <gerikson> Marxist analysis hasn't really been disproven, AFAIK
[14:10:19] <Brekkjern> gerikson: Yeah. And the BSDs are irrelevant to the customers of their app.
[14:10:20] <quanticle> gerikson: Similarly, for all I shit on PHP, my personal wiki is a PMWiki, which is written in PHP?
[14:10:31] <gerikson> it's still fruitfully used in historiography, literary analysis etc
[14:10:34] <quanticle> Why? Because all I had to do to set it up is create a folder and unzip a tarball
[14:10:46] <gerikson> Brekkjern: yeah
[14:13:42] <Brekkjern> (Free|Open|Whatever)BSD might be Gods gift to mankind, but as long as it's marketshare is less than a two digit percentage, it's absolutely irrelevant.
[14:14:16] <Brekkjern> Hell, Linux users should consider themselves lucky that anyone gives a shit about them considering their 2.3% marketshare...
[14:14:22] <quanticle> I agree with the sentiment, but I disagree with the threshold
[14:14:22] <gerikson> lolyeah
[14:14:54] <gerikson> "have you heard of our lord and savior, Gemini?" https://lobste.rs/s/sdum3p/if_you_could_rewrite_anything_from#c_45ajdg
[14:14:54] <buttsbot> If you could rewrite anything from scratch, what would it be? | Lobsters
[14:15:03] <quanticle> MacOS, even after OSX didn't reach a two-digit percentage for a very long time
[14:15:11] <quanticle> It might *just* have that level of marketshare now
[14:15:21] <Brekkjern> True. I just needed something that rolled off the tongue better than 9.5%
[14:15:28] <Brekkjern> Or whatever it is now
[14:15:29] <gerikson> Mac users were disproportioanally affluent tho
[14:15:39] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[14:15:46] <gerikson> there was also a healthy infra of payware for the Mac
[14:16:12] <Brekkjern> Mac users have already displayed willingness to throw an absurd amount of money at their device.
[14:16:30] <Brekkjern> FreeBSD users still run dual cores with 512MB of RAM
[14:17:04] <gerikson> I wonder what Adobe uses for its apps
[14:17:18] <gerikson> they're essentially cross-platform Win/Mac
[14:18:02] <quanticle> https://twitter.com/GavinPugh/status/1432987559882215428
[14:18:02] <buttsbot> Twitter - GavinPugh - @jtilander This. Slack is driving me insane. Hardly anyone "composes" their questions anymore, it's all stream of consciousne...
[14:18:19] <quanticle> (Slack is tangentially relevant to the Electron discussion)
[14:18:29] <quanticle> (And this is definitely related to the alienation discussion)
[14:18:44] <gerikson> but it's a people issue, not a tech issue...
[14:19:10] <gerikson> also these people are kvetching on Twitter, not on a blog ;)
[14:19:19] <quanticle> Lol
[14:19:24] <quanticle> Should I point that out
[14:19:51] <quanticle> "And yet here you are, complaining on Twitter rather than writing long-form blog posts :)"
[14:19:57] <gerikson> :D
[14:20:04] <gerikson> do you have asbestos underwear?
[14:20:48] <quanticle> Yeah, why not? I don't tweet very often. This is probably worth a tweet.
[14:28:44] <prussian> Easier to leave them self-absorbed honestly
[14:30:30] <quanticle> Too late!
[14:31:07] <gerikson> have a like
[14:31:10] <gerikson> ok lunctime
[14:31:22] <quanticle> Thanks
[14:31:27] <prussian> rip
[14:31:46] <gerikson> who wanted a link to activelow craziness? (techrights)
[14:31:59] <prussian> Sure
[14:32:06] <prussian> Sounds funny
[14:33:41] <gerikson> search for "Sep 01 10:37:58 <activelow>" here  http://techrights.org/irc-archives/irc-status.txt, and *passim*.
[14:34:00] <gerikson> note that this is a dump of many channels, #techpol is the one you want
[14:34:38] <gerikson> ``Sep 01 10:57:13 <activelow>besides, the most radical approach, such as the Gigatron TTL computer, can be documented and designed with a pencil and paper, and doesn't require complex software IDEs (such as Arduino IDE)''
[14:34:49] <gerikson> bbl lunch
[14:41:27] <prussian> Ty
[15:12:16] <Brekkjern> Why don't we go back to punchcards? Don't need any fancy or complex IDEs for that.
[15:12:31] <Brekkjern> Better yet. Freehand the holes rather than using a punch
[15:15:01] <quanticle> All I needed to program back in the day was a roll of paper tape, a sharp fingernail and a bottle of whiskey!
[15:26:43] <gerikson> lol
[15:33:38] <Brekkjern> Got that dumb challenge to work
[15:33:45] <Brekkjern> I'll forget the solution by the end of the day
[15:33:49] <Brekkjern> But I did get it to work
[15:34:01] <Brekkjern> (define (sign n)
[15:34:01] <Brekkjern>   (or (and (positive? n) 1)
[15:34:01] <Brekkjern>       (and (negative? n) -1)
[15:34:01] <Brekkjern>       (and (zero? n) 0 )))
[15:36:31] <gerikson> Brekkjern: did you see my link?
[15:36:43] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[15:37:10] <Brekkjern> I couldn't really get it to work with that, but with some fiddling with the REPL I got the above code
[15:37:15] <gerikson> :D
[15:37:48] <Brekkjern> The problem statement was to return 1, 0, or -1
[15:38:23] <Brekkjern> I got it to return 0, but not the right number in any direction
[15:38:31] <Brekkjern> And the above code is readable enough :P
[15:38:59] <Brekkjern> I guess I could drop the "and" condition of the last statement and just return 0, but... eh
[15:39:32] <Brekkjern> I've already spent too much time goofing off trying to get it to work :P
[15:41:08] <prussian> beautiful scheming.
[15:41:58] <gerikson> job interview question, right there
[15:42:45] <Brekkjern> If any job gave me that as a job interview question I wouldn't take them seriously...
[15:42:57] <prussian> define a function that maps a number to either 1, 0 or -1 based on signedness without control flow?
[15:43:06] <prussian> cuz idk...
[15:43:27] <quanticle> My immediate thought would be, "Let's have some fun with shift operators and bit maps"
[15:43:45] <gerikson> does scheme have such witchcraft
[15:43:46] <prussian> ya
[15:43:49] <quanticle> But maybe that's because, as much as I try to *pretend* I'm a Lisper, I'm really just a dirty C programmer at heart.
[15:43:55] <Brekkjern> I'm not saying this isn't a valuable thing to be able to do. I'm saying that it's not a valuable interview question.
[15:44:13] <quanticle> Oh, absolutely not.
[15:44:22] <quanticle> But it does sound like a fun code golf challenge
[15:44:30] <Brekkjern> That I agree on
[15:45:12] <prussian> it's kind of a lame assignment to be honest. reminds me of some js thing where we "couldn't" use arrays and I ended up using the principles of lambda calculus
[15:45:18] <quanticle> To be honest, hiring programmers based upon their ability to do these kinds of problems is like recruiting for a soccer team by looking at people's skills at hacky sack
[15:45:19] <prussian> and I was like, eat that teaching man.
[15:45:34] <Brekkjern> quanticle: That's kinda my point :P
[15:46:10] <Brekkjern> If you want to sort out the absolute shitters from the ones who at least knows some code, just show a piece of code and ask them to identify what it does.
[15:47:50] <Brekkjern> Or give them a task to code up at home and discuss the implementation the next interview
[15:48:04] <Brekkjern> That is probably a better solution to be honest.
[15:48:37] <Brekkjern> Sure, you can fake it, but you can still be fired for being incompetent and lying about your credentials after being hired.
[15:48:48] <prussian> idk man.
[15:49:07] <prussian> interviewing is dumb in general.
[15:49:34] <prussian> last time I was invited to do such things, someone handed me some paper of prescreened questions and I started scoffing at them in the interview.
[15:49:41] <prussian> was humorous.
[15:49:49] <gerikson> https://blog.plover.com/misc/job-interview.idea.html
[15:49:49] <buttsbot> The Universe of Discourse : How to fix hiring?
[15:50:14] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I gave them a code review of the interview questions :P
[15:50:16] <prussian> if the words "at will" really meant "at will" I think interviewing would basically look like a basic background check.
[15:50:31] <prussian> if they suck? fire them out of a cannon
[15:51:18] <gerikson> ``Dutch Entrepreneurs avoiding negative interest by opening multiple bank accounts ''
[15:51:28] <gerikson> isn't it better to create a business to make money?
[15:51:32] <gerikson> just spitballing here
[15:51:39] <prussian> oh... the algorithms. I dont even. I asked some guy to do binary search on a conditionally presorted array and was floored by the fumbling that happened.
[15:51:45] <prussian> wasn't sure how I felt about it
[15:52:22] <kline> "Complaints that this would discriminate against candidates with poor command of English do not hold water. Good command of English is one of the job requirements, and the whole point of a job interview is to discriminate against unqualified candidates"
[15:52:22] <prussian> gerikson: genius.
[15:52:25] <gerikson> pity? scorn? malice?
[15:52:29] <gerikson> so many feels!
[15:52:34] <kline> dare i re-use the lingo of a certain subculture and say "based"?
[15:52:37] <prussian> I didn't know anyone had any negative rates in the world.
[15:52:48] <gerikson> not for consumers, in any case
[15:53:07] <prussian> kline: I mean, I guess it's based?
[15:53:07] <gerikson> ``Various banks introduced negative interest rates on larger savings accounts over the past year''
[15:53:16] <prussian> if that's the need, that's the need I guess.
[15:53:22] <gerikson> "based" is such an overloaded term
[15:53:38] <kline> gerikson | ``Various banks introduced negative interest rates on larger savings accounts over the past year''
[15:53:42] <gerikson> author is self-confessed queer, married and has "mixed-race" children
[15:53:43] <prussian> I'm sorry
[15:53:46] <gerikson> so...
[15:53:49] <kline> we havent had a good bank run since, what, 2009?
[15:53:58] <gerikson> doubt he'd aprpreciated being called "based"
[15:53:59] <prussian> oh. you're reading hn frontpage
[15:54:00] <prussian> i c
[15:54:14] <gerikson> actually I'm reading the feed on IRC
[15:54:50] <prussian> gerikson: who the guy that wrote the interview q thing?
[15:54:55] <prussian> 07:23 < gerikson> author is self-confessed queer, married and has "mixed-race" children
[15:54:56] <prussian> this part
[15:55:28] <prussian> idk my "take" is just, talk, if they seem to be able to form coherent thought, hire, throw them some work, if the suck, fire them.
[15:55:39] <prussian> simple.
[15:55:51] <gerikson> prussian: yeah
[15:56:00] <Geekingfrog> it's quite expensive to make a wrong hiring decision though
[15:56:14] <prussian> ya, and that's the problem
[15:56:21] <Geekingfrog> in term of training, time required from everyone to integrate the new hire and so on…
[15:56:23] <prussian> which is why I mentioned if "at will" really meant "at will"
[15:56:28] <prussian> oh
[15:56:30] <prussian> I guess.
[15:56:52] <Geekingfrog> If only we could all be perfectly interchangeable
[15:56:55] <prussian> when I got brought on, at where I work now, I was basically pointed to some repo and a mission, if I chose to accept it.
[15:57:17] <prussian> the mission still made me sad.
[15:57:24] <Geekingfrog> that's a bit rough
[15:57:51] <prussian> I guess. it wasn't hard. it was just making the Makefile of others into something that semi worked.
[15:57:52] <gerikson> lol
[15:58:01] <prussian> really stupid, the whole thing was.
[15:58:04] <prussian> anyhow
[15:58:17] <Brekkjern> The best interviews I've had was to unfuck a problem the interviewer had to demonstrate my skill in the tool they needed me to handle, and another where I got an interesting problem to solve and 2 days to do it.
[15:58:39] <Brekkjern> These were both after the interviews where we talked and checked if I was a good fit as a person

[16:01:54] <buttsbot> The Universe of Discourse : How to fix hiring?
[16:02:30] <gerikson> according to UD, "based" is a meta-ironic term
[16:02:59] <companion_cube> Wow, how to hire English majors
[16:03:23] <companion_cube> And not a word on the proper use of emojis
[16:03:57] <kline> >english majors
[16:04:01] <kline> how do you figure?
[16:05:32] <gerikson> software dev is 20% coding, 80% communication
[16:06:18] <Church> Getting paged is based

[16:12:59] <wrl> THAT'll show em
[16:14:44] <prussian> gerikson: now that *is* based
[16:19:11] <companion_cube> kline: well, this tests communication and not code abilities :)
[16:20:14] <prussian> ok I had to upvote that article and I didn't read it, just for the rage bait or stupidity it will garner. assuming it isn't flagged.
[16:24:53] <prussian> 07:33 < companion_cube> And not a word on the proper use of emojis
[16:24:54] <prussian> so true.
[16:25:38] <prussian> I usually copy paste emojis while the windoze users at my work just use the Teams animated emote things
[16:25:49] <prussian> like sheesh. these guys can't even emoji

[16:27:16] <prussian> gerikson: so basically something literally no one but others in your circle would know or get?
[16:27:19] <prussian> sounds about right.
[16:27:25] <gerikson> lol
[16:27:33] <prussian> idk what a Patek Philippe is

[16:28:23] <gerikson> ``Here is where the caveat comes in - CryptoPunks, like Richard Mille, need a baseline of continuous culture permeation given how much newer the brand is. Celebrities and social media need to reference CryptoPunks - if attention fades, demand likely drops.''
[16:28:31] <gerikson> LOL
[16:28:39] <gerikson> stuck in a bubble
[16:28:55] <prussian> if someone is dropping big fat bands on them, someone thinks they're worth it.
[16:29:10] <prussian> ...
[16:29:37] <prussian> so basically it's a fashion fad?
[16:29:48] <prussian> now that I think about it, is fashion then, not a ponzi?
[16:30:03] <gerikson> nah, fashion is inherently ephemeral
[16:30:03] <prussian> a one of status and attention perhaps
[16:30:10] <prussian> fair
[16:30:11] <gerikson> no-one "invests" in fashion
[16:30:35] <gerikson> you invest in a fashion *creator* but that's on the assumption they'll keep making new, popular things
[16:30:39] <riv> > Celebrities and social media need to reference CryptoPunks
[16:30:40] <riv> wow so true
[16:30:45] <riv> amazing
[16:31:07] <gerikson> I'm a bit of a watch nerd, and Patek's aren't my jam, but they have an intrinsic value as objects of technology / art
