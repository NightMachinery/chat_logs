In Text Editor -> C# -> Advanced -> Run code analysis in external project (maybe turn that off for testing) and dunno what the "Enable pull diagnostics" do

[03:46:23] <sysRPL> i am moving on to robotics i think
[03:46:39] <sysRPL> servos, motors, sensors, electronics, and microcontrollers
[03:46:40] <bomb> why? what's interesting about robotics
[03:46:44] <bomb> ^ genuin question
[03:46:51] <sysRPL> because you vuild thigns and program them
[03:46:57] <sysRPL> build
[03:47:29] <bomb> you program robots. what problems your robots will solve?   < genuine quest
[03:47:54] <bomb> I ask cos I thinking to get a degree in EE or ME
[03:47:58] <sysRPL> though i think i might just use dotnet and pi zero w 2 for projects inplace of microcontrollers
[03:48:25] <bomb> ME sounds more useful than EE for robotics to me, because all the cool machine designs you can do
[03:48:31] <sysRPL> i would be building toys / vehicles mostly
[03:48:48] <bomb> no need an EE degree to connect some rpi to servos
[03:48:55] <sysRPL> i am still searching for the right etrike frame
[03:49:01] <bomb> vehicles aha what kind?
[03:49:10] <sysRPL> an etrike
[03:49:13] <bomb> are you into agri/horti by chance?

[03:50:01] <sysRPL> great scott has does some work in that area
[03:50:09] <bomb> yeah man there is a lot to explore there
[03:50:23] <sysRPL> i am usually more interested in the software side of all these things and combining more electronic components
[03:50:24] <bomb> because most farmers are farming like it's fucking 0 A.D.

[03:54:08] <sysRPL> well i am generally more itnerested in building electronics, circuits, and using them with custom programming

[13:15:30] <jmer> earthy: you know, that's a very good way of viewing it xD
[13:15:35] <Tobbi_> I'm treating myself to a new cheap smartphone :D
[13:15:55] <jmer> Tobbi_: check out Nokias smartphones. It's good quality for a very competitive price
[13:16:17] <jmer> and STOCK android!!! with 3 years guaranteed security updates
[13:16:22] <Tobbi_> I got myself a "Realme 8"
[13:16:29] <Tobbi_> very good quality for the price.
[13:16:30] <jmer> I don't even know whta that is
[13:16:30] <Tobbi_> So...
[13:16:35] <Tobbi_> Exactly.
[13:16:37] <Tobbi_> :D
[13:16:40] <jmer> How much did you pay?
[13:16:46] <Tobbi_> 170
[13:17:06] <Tobbi_> Considering my tendency to break the screens of those...
[13:17:17] <jmer> Why don't you just buy a screen protector?
[13:17:26] <Tobbi_> I am now.
[13:17:27] <Tobbi_> :D
[13:17:50] <Tobbi_> No, but my previous one had only 16 GB of space.
[13:17:51] <jmer> but yeah ok the Nokia we just bought for my wife was 380€or something like that
[13:18:07] <Tobbi_> not bad I guess...

[13:20:00] <bomb> he steals his own phone? that's trippy AF
[13:20:37] <jmer> I don't follow mobile CPUs but it's a Snapdragon 480...
[13:23:36] <Tobbi_> My phone has 6 GB RAM and 128 GB space.
[13:23:44] <Tobbi_> I mean, the one I'm buying.
[13:24:14] <Tobbi_> Current one only has 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of space.
[13:24:18] <jmer> But does it have a 64 MP Quad camera? :P
[13:24:25] <Tobbi_> the one I'm buying?
[13:24:26] <Tobbi_> hang on.
[13:24:28] <jmer> yes

[15:51:05] <xb0o2> And given that it's Russia who's the aggressor, I don't think there's realistically any country in the world that would particularly be interested in going to war with them.
[15:51:14] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: to get putin out of ukraine
[15:51:47] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Okay so Putin can "stay", we just want to defend?
[15:52:43] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: yes, although i wouldn't be too upset if putin had an "accident"

[15:54:58] <alguien> I use a IStringLocalizerFactory to obtain a IStringLocalizer, but it doesn't translate my strings. I can see the string localizer's _resourceBaseName is "Application.Resources.REDACTED.resx", and Application.resources.dll contains this string (I have a REDACTED.resx in Application/Resources, that's why I reckon), but strings are still not localized. I get the same Value as the Key. Can anyone suggest how to diagnose the problem?
[15:55:53] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: So we send troops, then "they" launch one or more nuclear missiles, what do we do?
[15:56:10] <bomb> MatthiasVance it would be extrajudicial execution
[15:56:25] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: then we take out putin
[15:56:47] <JakeSays> but not even putin is dumb enough to use nukes

[15:58:27] <alguien> JakeSays, 😑
[15:59:26] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: So the current decision might be "we don't send troops because we fear a nuclear fallout and let's see how this plays out first"?
[15:59:43] <MatthiasVance> We'll send them "help" and condemn it, but that's it
[16:00:07] <bomb> just send JakeRambo he'll kill Putin and entire Russian army
[16:00:40] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i don't think that's the current decision. i genuinely don't think we're afraid of putin.
[16:00:59] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Well, we aren't sending troops (publicly)
[16:01:17] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: correct - for political reasons.

[16:30:26] <Tobbi_> Probably stupid question
[16:31:00] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: no.
[16:31:37] <Tobbi_> So, Putin will probably not risk an invasion into a NATO nation's territory.
[16:32:04] <Babbage> some nato countries (uk, france, etc.) do have some very advanced military as well
[16:32:06] <JakeSays> russia has more troops in europe than nato
[16:32:18] <JakeSays> (i think)
[16:32:22] <Tobbi_> Ah
[16:32:23] <JakeSays> but not all of nato
[16:32:29] <Babbage> russia also has troups tied up in other things/protection points etc.

[16:33:47] <JakeSays> bomb: nato will definitely fight for romania
[16:34:07] <xb0o2> The premise of NATO doesn't work if members don't actually defend each other.
[16:34:07] <bomb> definitely, if you say so
[16:34:26] <JakeSays> the US already has troops in romania.
[16:34:30] <xb0o2> At that point you might as well just disband the whole thing.

[16:44:38] <Tobbi_> I just pretended to be mental (was my normal way)
[16:44:44] <MatthiasVance> Austria still has a mandatory period you need to serve, either in military or other public things
[16:44:54] <MatthiasVance> I learned that recently
[16:45:24] <Tobbi_> I don't get it...Austria has enough natural defences...
[16:45:25] <MatthiasVance> And some people just choose military because otherwise finding a job takes way longer before they can start university

[16:45:35] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yeah conscription has been paused for a decade now, they sent me a letter to conscript me and then dropped me like a hot potatoe when i told them i was diabetic and then they immediately dropped conscription alltogether
[16:45:52] <interop_madness> 6 months military, 9 month civilian service in austria
[16:46:13] <JakeSays> Suchiman: a voluntary military is better anyway
[16:46:17] <Tobbi_> I was doing the conscription test thing and tried finding ways to get out of it.... Luckily, they figured out I had knee problems.
[16:46:29] <Tobbi_> And I had to go to a second army physician.
[16:46:31] <MatthiasVance> Insanity?
[16:46:34] <Tobbi_> And he asked me whether I want to join.
[16:46:39] <Tobbi_> I said no.
[16:46:45] <MatthiasVance> Ah, that's nice :)
[16:46:47] <Tobbi_> So he wrote a letter stating that I was unfit for service :D
[16:46:51] <Tobbi_> Yup it was :)

[16:47:06] <Tobbi_> march load?

[16:49:23] <JakeSays> but my heart will always belong to the F-16 *sigh*
[16:49:33] <Tobbi_> I guess she was actually sad that I didn't get conscripted in the end.
[16:50:15] <xb0o2> I am shamelessly an F-22 kind of guy.
[16:50:25] <interop_madness> I would have bought the Gripen as a replacement for Draken if I were Austria
[16:50:29] <Tobbi_> If F-22 stands for female and 22 years old, then yeah.
[16:50:30] <Tobbi_> I'm the same.
[16:50:36] <interop_madness> not necessarily the Eurofighter
[16:50:46] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Yeah I can understand that, it brings a lot of structure
[16:50:48] <JakeSays> xb0o2: i was an F-16 mechanic so i'm biased

[20:23:03] <JakeSays> peterR``: as long as there are only blittable types in it, yes

[20:28:09] <Nasp> xb0o2:  yeah pupeteer feels strange
[20:28:25] <xb0o2> When you say webkittohtml, do you mean wkhtmltopdf?
[20:29:14] <Ownix> Nasp: Im gonna use Liquid, I have successfully gotten RazorLight to work in an net6.0 app using embedded razor templates. However, I did not like the approach, you have to enable all sorts of compilation flags and stuff. I am going to use Liquid in another project for simplicity.
[20:29:40] <peterR``> JakeSays, right, there are only blittable types, but the API still requires IntPtr - how can I convert it to IntPtr?
[20:30:02] <Nasp> Ownix:  Liquid for template or pdf?
[20:30:08] <Nasp> No idea what liquid is
[20:30:24] <Nasp> xb0o2: Doh, yes i mean to pdf
[20:30:39] <Ownix> Nasp: Liquid for email templates. Liquid is a templating language, it is supported by FluentEmail as a renderer. It is backed by the Fluid project. https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid
[20:30:43] <xb0o2> Ok so yeah we've basically followed the same trajectory ^^

[20:30:56] <Ownix> I am ripping my hair out with IConfigureOptions.
[20:31:26] <JakeSays> peterR``: once you pin it you can just cast it to an intptr: (IntPtr) foo
[20:31:32] <Nasp> Ownix:  Ohh so not razor
[20:31:38] <Nasp> But yeah just different templating engine
[20:31:51] <Nasp> Any particular reason you want to use liquid and not just razor?
[20:32:01] <Ownix> Nasp: Yeah, but i do have experience with RazorLight, for use with email templating using FluentEmail, SendGrid, and SMPT (for PaperCut).
[20:32:02] <JakeSays> he's thirsty
[20:32:08] <Nasp> xb0o2: We also had some security issues with all of these
[20:32:21] <Nasp> But most probably due to our own fault
[20:32:29] <Ownix> Nasp: RazorLight has all sorts of compilation, reference assemblies, and potential security risks.
[20:32:44] <Ownix> Liquid is a simple and light templating language
[20:32:52] <Ownix> Its also use in Microsoft Azure products
[20:33:02] <Nasp> We had to decide between two solutiosn razorlight and some other
[20:33:08] <Nasp> And the other didn't have built in security features
[20:33:12] <Nasp> So i didn't want that

[20:57:59] <sysRPN> brianonymous_: they quality and lifetime is terrible
[20:58:03] <brianonymous_> they are saying we are sending Transfer and Content encoding as identity, and that is illegal?
[20:58:44] <sysRPN> tesla cars have a big problem no one is addressing ... and that is their tech doesn't last
[20:58:58] <sysRPN> i can buy and run a 1970 ford no problem
[20:59:00] <jonp> which set of tech?  batteries?  other?
[20:59:29] <sysRPN> you can't keep a telsa on the road for very long compared to gas powered cars
[20:59:57] <Telgareith> last hope.... how do I make this work? "DbContext.Table.Where(gt => (gt.Guid.ToString().Count() == 36) && (gt.DateTime_nullable.Date == DateTime.Date));"
[20:59:58] <sysRPN> tesla is builing a world of disposable high priced unmaintainablecars
[21:00:14] <sysRPN> filled with exotic metals
[21:00:19] <Telgareith> It's complaining about the date comparison being untranslatable
[21:00:58] <Telgareith> and I switched the variables for the datatypes
[21:01:26] <Telgareith> mostly... missed one
[21:01:27] <sysRPN> tesla is also build a world on vehicles with an order of magnitutude more quailty control problems
[21:01:50] <Nasp> sysRPN: Ohh yeah one time cars!
[21:02:02] <sysRPN> Nasp: unrepairable cars

[21:02:32] <Nasp> Telgareith: Why are you ToStringing your guid to check the count?
[21:02:35] <Nasp> It looks rather strange
[21:02:38] <sysRPN> cars without a part catalogue

[21:03:07] <Nasp> sysRPN:  Do i need to visit teh car mechanic or call an electrician?
[21:03:19] <Telgareith> I might not need to
[21:03:23] <Telgareith> but that's not the question
[21:03:24] <sysRPN> how is a mechanic going to fix a tesla engine?
[21:03:45] <sysRPN> how is a mechanic going to fix a tesla door handle?
[21:04:21] <Nasp> Is DateTime.Date a .NET 6 thing
[21:04:22] <sysRPN> it's all electronic with custom ICs
[21:05:00] <pandem> Telgareith: your question is: "how do I make this work?" and with the information you have given no one can answer that
[21:05:04] <Diablo-D3> tbf, the mechanic just needs to go through the tesla training program
[21:05:09] <Diablo-D3> because its all physical labor either way
[21:05:14] <Nasp> DateTime_nullable.Date looks strange as  well
[21:05:17] <Diablo-D3> mechanics generally dont "fix" cars
[21:05:20] <Diablo-D3> they replace parts.
[21:05:32] <sysRPN> Diablo-D3: there is no independent tesla training program
[21:05:45] <sysRPN> the only people trained to work on tesla work at the tesla factory
[21:05:50] <Diablo-D3> no, and there is no independent ford, gm, chrysler, toyota, etc one either
[21:06:08] <sysRPN> yeah there are ... dealers are independent
[21:06:10] <Diablo-D3> if you're a mechanic, you pay for that certification.
[21:06:23] <sysRPN> auto garages are independent
[21:06:24] <Diablo-D3> no, now you're conflating more than one issue
[21:06:34] <Diablo-D3> there are mechanics that work for dealers, and then independent ones
[21:06:47] <sysRPN> there is no tesla certicied auto mechinics course
[21:06:49] <Diablo-D3> they both have to have the certification from the company to work on that car meaningfully.
[21:06:51] <Telgareith> what other information is needed?
[21:07:08] <Diablo-D3> sysRPN: there is, however very few mechanics have done it as they dont want business from tesla owners
[21:07:33] <Diablo-D3> if I need a tesla fixed, they're not driving it 5000 miles back to california.
[21:07:42] <sysRPN> the only course telsa has is for people that work at tesla
[21:08:12] <Diablo-D3> tesla does not have dealership mechanics and body shops
[21:08:18] <Diablo-D3> tesla *doesnt have dealerships*
[21:08:23] <sysRPN> no shit
[21:08:32] <Diablo-D3> teslas still go into the shop and get fixed.
[21:08:37] <DevJohnC> Nasp, yeah .NET 6 introduced DateOnly and TimeOnly iirc
[21:08:42] <sysRPN> Diablo-D3: what shop?
[21:08:49] <Telgareith> I'm stuck on 4.6.2
[21:08:55] <Diablo-D3> whichever one tesla partnered with in your area
[21:09:07] <sysRPN> you can't take your tesla to a repait shop
[21:09:11] <Diablo-D3> for me, iirc it'd be a 4 hour drive away instead of a 45 minute drive away
[21:09:23] <Diablo-D3> but I also live in a rural area, so
[21:09:36] <Diablo-D3> sysRPN: yes, I have to take it to one thats gone through the tesla program.
[21:09:55] <Diablo-D3> most repair shops arent setup to handle *any* non-ice vehicles
[21:10:18] <Diablo-D3> they don't have the training nor the certification nor anything else they'd require for it
[21:10:29] * sysRPN ignores Diablo-D3 
[21:10:46] <Diablo-D3> dunno why you're trying to fud this
[21:10:55] * sysRPN Diablo-D3!*@* added to ignore list.
[21:11:04] <Diablo-D3> lol
[21:11:07] <Diablo-D3> I call him on fud, he ignores me
[21:11:10] <Diablo-D3> irc never changes :D

[23:14:10] <irwiss> i mean... unless it can load the dishes on wifi too there's not much point in wifi anyway
[23:14:31] <ki9a> the only cool feature the dishwasher has is a blue dot
[23:14:35] <ki9a> it turns off when it's done
[23:14:54] <ki9a> it lights to the floor

[23:26:03] <DoofusCanadensis> it's also a large enough area that we could probably put wind farms in various parts of the province and guarantee at one or more are always producing a minimum amount
[23:26:27] <Nasp> No you cant
[23:26:44] <Nasp> You need storage of energy for that
[23:27:29] <DoofusCanadensis> fair
[23:28:12] <Nasp> Quite an increase https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/SZZ9SqTq/image.png
[23:28:32] <Nasp> I can't find the hourly statistics where you can see the hour by hour flucuations in prices

[23:32:46] <Nasp> Here's one for the other day and i've seen it before where the power is basicly free during the night https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/DLPktNtF/image.png
[23:33:56] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: i haven't explored the option; I won't get it for another year or so :)
[23:34:05] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: but I wanted to go without it and that wasn't an optino
[23:34:22] <MatthiasVance> Yeah, it usually isn't these days xD
[23:34:53] <ki9a> the latest Siemens combi fridges also have a larger fruit/veg thing
[23:35:01] <ki9a> and the holder in the door is higher up
[23:35:04] <ki9a> I hate that
[23:35:23] <ki9a> had to get a 300+ more expensive to get a sane fridge
[23:36:44] <Nasp> I hate the larger fruit veggie things
[23:36:49] <Nasp> Can barely get anyone without it
[23:36:56] <Nasp> There's not just one buy 2-3 now
[23:37:00] <Nasp> And like only one shelf left
[23:37:10] <Nasp> ki9a:  Same with the higher door i hate that too
[23:37:21] <Nasp> I had the exact same problem
[23:37:26] <Nasp> Impossible to just get a normal fridge
[23:37:50] <ki9a> that yes.

[23:40:39] <ki9a> seems the dishwaster has wifi too :(
[23:41:21] <Nasp> Hmm  looks nice
[23:41:42] <Nasp> But wouldn't you want the counter to have a bit of padding so you can have chairs there
[23:41:51] <ki9a> No
[23:42:02] <ki9a> there's a table right next to it

[23:43:01] <ki9a> I'm curious how well this will work
[23:43:01] <Nasp> Are you getting a cooker / quooker as well
[23:43:05] <ki9a> no
[23:43:08] <ki9a> I don't drink tea
[23:43:08] <Nasp> Those seems to be popular, not that i get why
[23:43:40] <ki9a> I don't see the point
[23:43:42] <Nasp> ARe the zones all big and same sizeon that stove
[23:43:43] <ki9a> it just costs a lot
[23:43:45] <Nasp> Neither do it
[23:43:46] <ki9a> daily and initially
[23:43:47] <Nasp> Yeah
[23:43:51] <Nasp> And it doen'st take that long to boil water
[23:44:19] <Nasp> Some also get them with boiliner water, and chilled water, and built in soda streamer
[23:44:44] <Nasp> Does it also have built in ventilation in the stove?
[23:44:47] <ki9a> yes
[23:44:49] <ki9a> in teh middle
[23:44:54] <Nasp> Ive seen those and im just thinking what happens if you have an overspill
[23:45:07] <ki9a> Very good question
[23:45:09] <ki9a> no idea

[23:46:38] <ki9a> Nasp: theres apparently something under it that would catch that; some kind of pan
[23:46:39] <Nasp> I like that fridge, i've had a hard time finding one like that
[23:46:54] <Nasp> But i hate how adjustable shelves spacing also have gone away
[23:47:23] <ki9a> https://www.siemens-home.bsh-group.com/nl/productoverzicht/koelen-en-vriezen/inbouw-koelkasten-en-vriezers/inbouw-koel-vriescombinaties-met-vriesgedeelte-onder/KI86NNSF0
[23:47:26] <ki9a> this was the "default"
[23:47:38] <Nasp> I looked at a lot and i'm like, i dont care how it looks, i care about it's interior space and funciton
[23:48:03] <MatthiasVance> I had a really good fridge before I moved here, now the choice we had was a bit .. limited
[23:48:05] <ki9a> the one I picked can easily be changed
[23:48:09] <MatthiasVance> Even the top of the line was way below what I had before
[23:48:35] <Nasp> This is the new norm https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/H1fBNXt5/image.png
[23:48:47] <ki9a> ugh
[23:48:52] <Nasp> Two veggie thingies and only small shelves. Yoi can't even have leftovers still in the pot
[23:48:59] <ki9a> what's with lack of shelves!
[23:49:18] <Nasp> The fridge i found and i'm not happy with it only have one veggie thingies, but the shelves are so small i can't even have a small bottle of ketchup in it
[23:49:22] <Nasp> I dont get it either
[23:49:36] <Nasp> Who are the people who find this kind of fridges more nice
[23:49:40] <ki9a> the wine holder
[23:49:41] <Nasp> "Ohh less space for my food, great"
[23:49:42] <ki9a> or bottle holder
[23:49:47] <ki9a>  are also completely useless
[23:49:54] <ki9a> my current one had that but I removed them
[23:50:02] <MatthiasVance> I always remove that too
[23:50:27] <Nasp> Atleast have the option to remove / move it
[23:50:35] <Nasp> And be smart and place it in the top, not in the middle...
[23:50:48] <Nasp> I want a space where i can just take the leftover food in a pot, put a lid on it, and in the fridge
[23:50:58] <ki9a> I got the layout of the bathroom agreed on too (just not the tiles yet)
[23:51:01] <ki9a> so that's something too
[23:51:09] <Nasp> I'm guessing huge tiles?
[23:51:10] <ki9a> Nasp: Exactly!
[23:51:16] <ki9a> Nasp: that eihter way
[23:51:19] <ki9a> at least 60x60
[23:51:21] <ki9a> probably larger
[23:51:30] <ki9a> I do work for a tile company though
[23:51:39] <Nasp> I'm glad others agree because i've tried to tell it to others and they dont seem to get this frustration
[23:51:58] <Nasp> Ok so not that large
[23:52:02] <Nasp> Ohh wait
[23:52:15] <Nasp> Noope as expected, i just had to visualize 60cm
[23:52:28] <ki9a> well I don't see the point of 1x1 tiles
[23:52:33] <ki9a> not in a space of 3x4

[23:52:36] <Nasp> ki9a: Have you planned for a Roomba garage?
[23:52:44] <ki9a> I have no idea what that is
[23:52:46] <ki9a> so no
[23:52:58] <ki9a> main room will be pvc floor
[23:53:07] <Nasp> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuevuY8RHU
[23:53:09] <ki9a> bathroom/toilet tiles ofc
[23:53:33] <ki9a> hahaha
[23:53:38] <Nasp> Mainroom as in kitchen plus dinning?
[23:53:42] <ki9a> yes
[23:53:44] <ki9a> it's open
[23:53:46] <Nasp> Those new click floors i take it
[23:53:54] <ki9a> kitchen, dining, tv etc
[23:53:55] <Nasp> As in wood look alike
[23:54:01] <ki9a> not click
[23:54:08] <ki9a> it's glued to the concrete
[23:54:12] <ki9a> 2-3mm thick
[23:54:24] <ki9a> wood lookalike though
[23:54:31] <Nasp> Yeah that's click floor isn't it?
[23:54:37] <ki9a> no click floors actually click
[23:54:46] <ki9a> they usually are pvc on top of woodboard
[23:54:56] <ki9a> and those click together
[23:54:58] <ki9a> this is glue
[23:55:17] <Nasp> Ahh
[23:55:25] <ki9a> but looks the same
[23:55:40] <Nasp> And decent priced
[23:55:46] <ki9a> sort of
[23:55:48] <ki9a> it's cheaper
[23:55:53] <ki9a> but the floor needs to be 100% perfect
[23:56:02] <ki9a> so egalized
[23:56:06] <ki9a> or whatever the word is
[23:56:07] <Nasp> My sister has tiles in the kitchen dinning area
[23:56:14] <Nasp> It's quite practical for spills and such in the kitchen
[23:56:19] <ki9a> I have tiles now too
[23:56:20] <Nasp> But my feet ache by walking on it
[23:56:24] <ki9a> but pvc is also pretty much water proof
[23:56:28] <ki9a> note that I have floor heating
[23:56:33] <Nasp> Ahh
[23:56:52] <ki9a> I only have floor heating actually
[23:56:58] <Nasp> Have you noticed many put the sinks in the center console
[23:57:08] <Nasp> Or whatever you would call the isle for your stove
[23:57:14] <ki9a> island
[23:57:16] <ki9a> yeah
[23:57:21] <ki9a> some do
[23:57:28] <ki9a> I think I spend more time cooking than washing
[23:57:36] <Nasp> Yeah, i would agree
[23:57:38] <ki9a> so when cooking I want to look into the house
[23:57:46] <Nasp> And rather have it with the stove in the middle
[23:57:53] <ki9a> also I don't want to cook under a window
[23:57:53] <Nasp> So you can watch TV and cook steaks :D
[23:57:58] <ki9a> (pain to clean)
[23:58:54] <Nasp> Is this a render, or a render + picture
[23:59:00] <Nasp> The kitchen picture
[23:59:01] <ki9a> render
[23:59:07] <ki9a> the house still has to be built
[23:59:15] <Nasp> Ohh so you are movin
[23:59:20] <ki9a> bought a new house yes
[23:59:28] <ki9a> so thats' why I'm redoing everything
[23:59:28] <Nasp> Didn't you also renovate a lot in the other house
[23:59:32] <ki9a> I did!
[23:59:36] <ki9a> sold it for a good price
[23:59:37] <Nasp> I believe i remember you redid the living room
[23:59:38] <ki9a> for next year
[23:59:55] <Nasp> And the house is done around that time
