[19:28:56] <jim> what would you need to see, to try helping specifically?
[19:29:55] <GinFuyou> maybe you are sending form to the context incorrectly, e.g. new instance instead of one that was (in)validated?
[19:32:21] <jim> maybe
[19:33:52] <GinFuyou> you can also try form.errors.as_data() in python to make sure # iirc, might be slightly different

[23:47:59] <vlt> Hello :)  I want to .pop() an element from request.session["my_list"]. Is loading the list from the session in a local "non-session" variable, then running .pop() and then writing that list back to request.session the normal way or am I doing something wrong here?

[23:56:34] <GinFuyou> vlt, why can't you pop directly from the session?
