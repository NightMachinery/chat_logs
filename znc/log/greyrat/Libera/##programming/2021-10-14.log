[00:24:17] <oldlaptop> (There are more that have fallen out of widespread use, such as motif, the various motif workalikes, and Tk)
[00:24:33] <oldlaptop> GTK and Qt are both cross-platform as well as being the two de facto standards on free unix-likes.
[00:24:39] <pulse> i strongly dislike Qt
[00:24:48] <sonny> tk is solid, but it requires some work to get on windows, or from a 3rd party
[00:24:57] <pulse> and GTK is so buggy it could be a case study for how to make the buggiest code possible
[00:24:59] <manicennui> oldlaptop: There is a very good chance you will install something that uses something other than Qt and GTK, and good luck getting everything to look similar.
[00:25:01] <oldlaptop> (gtk is also targeted by some other "cross-platform" toolkits, such as wxwidgets and javafx)
[00:25:14] <pulse> wxWidgets is probably best option for crossplat
[00:25:16] <oldlaptop> Tk on windows is not particularly hard, certainly not for deployment.
[00:25:39] <oldlaptop> manicennui: Really? Such as what?
[00:25:40] <manicennui> Even apps that use different major versions of GTK might look and behave differently.
[00:25:47] <oldlaptop> xterm does come immediately to mind, but that's a special case
[00:25:57] <sonny> it seems like you have to get a 3rd party source for tk on windows
[00:26:05] <oldlaptop> you'll certainly get no defense of the way gtk development has gone in recent years from me
[00:26:14] <sonny> or build it yourself
[00:26:30] <pyzozord> I decided (wait for it) to write my own ui toolkit. I'll put together freetype, some opengl based vector graphics library, and write my own immediate mode guis with that

[00:49:42] <sonny> bash can't be replaced, too much legacy
[00:49:50] <sonny> some one is trying with oilshell
[00:49:56] <jtgd> of course, except for new code.

[00:50:10] <sonny> still, he has working code
[00:50:17] <CaCode> to replace bash it has to be massively better than bash

[00:50:36] <sonny> it's really difficult to do
[00:50:44] <sonny> better to start fresh

[00:51:22] <jtgd> D is C++ done right
[00:51:37] <sonny> it is
[00:52:00] <sonny> but I have no interest in that, and it seems c++ people just kept to c++

[00:55:06] <jtgd> no, they tried to address the problem of complex data, not just text lines but tables and structs. I suppose it easier if you keep withint their provided programs, but anything outside I would want to combine bash to do things they didn't anticipate. that's the beauty of bash.

[00:58:48] <jtgd> of course the goal (of any language) is to do whatever you want as easily as possible
[00:59:43] <oldlaptop> trying to do *everything* as easily as possible all at once is an excellent way to do nothing particularly easily

[01:00:48] <pulse> :p
[01:01:16] <peteyboy1> what's the point of time limitations in scrum sprints?
[01:01:21] <oldlaptop> (some, particularly bash, have lots of extensions to try to make writing programs easier - and I would contend that the urge to use any of them is a pretty good heuristic for programs that really should be written in some other language)
[01:01:57] <peteyboy1> or what's the point of sprints in general?
[01:02:03] <jtgd> pulse: allows you to write code that no one else can understand(maintain)
[01:02:16] <manicennui> peteyboy1: To deliver iteratively with a predictable cadence. 
[01:02:42] <pulse> peteyboy1, please middle management
[01:02:44] <peteyboy1> manicennui, well that's poetic
[01:03:09] <pulse> when you realize SCRUM is literally waterfall you'll cry and laugh at the same time
[01:03:32] <oldlaptop> just with a lot more standing around
[01:03:33] <pulse> all these management techniques are capable of doing is needlessly complicate the dev process
[01:03:36] <pulse> oldlaptop++
[01:03:50] <arahael> CaCode: thats not difficult ;)
[01:04:01] <peteyboy1> i mean, if someone wants to do their best, they'll do their best. if someone doesn't want to do it, some magical letters on the screen won't make him go any faster. and if he isn't realistically able to do it within a given timeframe, that just means he is working under pressure, which decreases work quality
[01:04:06] <peteyboy1> that's my noobie interpretation
[01:04:13] <arahael> CaCode: ugh, ignore that - i was scrolled back.
[01:04:13] <jtgd> my take on agile is that it allows management a view into the process and they value that so much they are willing to take a 50% productivity hit
[01:04:25] <manicennui> peteyboy1: It requires breaking things down into smaller pieces.
[01:04:39] <manicennui> You can't take a 6-month project and try to complete it in 2-4 weeks.
[01:04:53] <pyzozord> they were deisgned to be lightweight, comapring to real waterfall or more involved project management methods like prince2
[01:04:59] <CaCode> arahael: heh, you like scrum?
[01:04:59] <peteyboy1> manicennui, can we not have "to do/in progress/for review/done" without time limits or timeframes?
[01:05:10] <manicennui> peteyboy1: Sure, look at kanban.
[01:05:27] <arahael> CaCode: i was responding to... the bash point, i contend that bash is terrible and a low bar ;)
[01:05:31] <pulse> i use a kanban style board for management and only because i like visually seeing what i need to do
[01:05:39] <manicennui> But frankly, as pyzozord stated, it is a reaction to waterfall.
[01:05:42] <pulse> it's no more useful than a todo list on a napkin
[01:05:44] <pulse> but it is more visually pleasing
[01:05:46] <manicennui> As well as the fact that most developers can't be trusted.
[01:05:52] <peteyboy1> manicennui, so what's the idea behind timeframes and time limits? does someone expect someone to finish 10 days work in 5 days?
[01:05:58] <manicennui> When people trust you, they tend to give you far more leeway. 
[01:06:05] <manicennui> peteyboy1: No.
[01:06:06] <peteyboy1> 10 days worth or work*
[01:06:14] <ntwk> peteyboy1: The idea behind timeframes and time limits is to get shit done.
[01:06:31] <manicennui> There are few tasks that are 10 days of work unless they haven't been broken down.
[01:06:57] <manicennui> And it is possible to carry stories over.
[01:06:58] <pulse> task: 5 days timeframe. bug: not so fast, little one
[01:06:59] <flakonium_tubes> yesyou will get shit, done.
[01:07:27] <peteyboy1> ntwk, that's reasonable, but how much do they really force people to do their best? and is forcing someone instead of letting them work at 90% but being constant worth it?
[01:07:43] <manicennui> Frankly, it is all about trust. Developers don't act like professionals so they aren't treated like professionals. 
[01:07:47] <CaCode> Uncle bob said the point is to make the overall effort and time needed to complete a project more predictable
[01:08:02] <flakonium_tubes> professional mens nothing
[01:08:05] <cth> manicennui, I like your approach
[01:08:07] <manicennui> CaCode: Yes, as I stated, a regular cadence of iterative delivery.
[01:08:09] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: project management frameworks won't solve those kinds of problems for you
[01:08:11] <flakonium_tubes> almost meaningless adjective
[01:08:22] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: that is a people managing problem not project managing problem
[01:08:23] <manicennui> Instead of letting developers go off and play for 6 months and hoping they create something.
[01:08:25] <CaCode> since you can't know in advance, you use these smaller fragments to gauge the overall leangth of the project as you go... but I woudln't know
[01:08:42] <ntwk> peteyboy1: I don't know that time limits produce the most correct result if that's what you mean by best.

[01:15:42] <manicennui> With BDUF, you often end up working on a lot of crap that isn't very important.
[01:15:59] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: it's not only for you, it's for the entire team. It makes you do a little busy work to make team coordination better and provide more transparency to the project manager

[01:36:42] <ntwk> I do think "quality" has a value, I just think it's often higher than than what people are willing to pay.  Writing software is a new thing in the grand scheme of building stuff and it's kind of hard.  We haven't really figured out how to do it cheaply.

[01:38:54] <manicennui> The US automakers would have gone out of business 30 years ago if anyone cared about quality.
[01:38:55] <ntwk> I think for most people's needs building's have to be designed so that they don't fall down, don't burn down easily and are reasonably safe.  The rest tends to be secondary. 
[01:39:13] <flakonium_tubes> is intel not interested in business?

[02:17:00] <flakonium_tubes> so 4 percent gets you a few hundred million? sounds like good chances, not very high risk
[02:17:09] <flakonium_tubes> considering there are only three options
[02:17:24] <manicennui> I'm sure the Firefox deal is mostly due to their past relationship at this point.

[04:56:48] <PlanckWalk> When they meet up at the first stage, say the tortoise has taken k steps.  You know that k >= the start of the loop and that the length of the loop divides k (because the tortoise has gone k extra steps and is at the same point).

[05:00:18] <jazzy> alright I was quite lost for a bit there
[05:01:13] <PlanckWalk> So rewinding by k steps means that they still differ by a multiple of loop length.
[05:01:31] <PlanckWalk> Which means as soon as one enters the loop, the other is also back to the start of the loop.
[05:02:28] <jazzy> okay, I'll digest this for a bit

[09:03:22] <EnchanterTim> PORTLAND, Ore. â€” Portland police say 100 anarchists marched through downtown Portland Tuesday night, doing $500,000 in damage.
[09:03:36] <flakonium_tubes> didn't they capture a police station at one point?
[09:03:40] <EnchanterTim> Yeah
[09:03:44] <Quietwalker> vdamewood: Yeah, I think when I was there, they didn't really even have a ... real computer section.  I mean, not really.  Back in 98-99 though.

[09:08:19] <vdamewood> I'm drooling over NT Workstation, but OS/2 Warp 3 would be awesome too.

[09:13:51] <Quietwalker> every once in a while I boot that thing up and play a few games.
[09:14:08] <Quietwalker> Ultima V. Neuromancer. ... the original bards tale games were actually pretty awful ...
[09:14:13] <Quietwalker> oh, I've got wasteland.
[09:14:20] <Quietwalker> and the little paragraph book
[09:14:24] <vdamewood> Fallout 0?
[09:14:27] <Quietwalker> yeah
[09:14:41] <Quietwalker> and all the original boxes and such, though mostly dinged up at this point.
[09:15:10] <Quietwalker> I really gotta clean up stuff eventually.  Never had very many disks go bad ever really either.
[09:15:46] <vdamewood> I found a 50-floppy copy of OS/2 Warp 4.1 at school. We tried installing it in VMware, and Disk 2 was damaged.
[09:15:53] <vdamewood> I was seriously disapointed.
[09:16:00] <Quietwalker> aww
[09:17:30] <Quietwalker> still, you should be able to find them online now and reimage.
[09:17:38] <Quietwalker> it's not ... exactly the same ... but it is close, right?
[09:18:04] <Quietwalker> hmm. what was that other warp-like OS ... something that felt all token-ring-y ...
[09:18:09] <Jong> what do you call public facing functions?
[09:18:11] <Jong> entry points?
[09:18:11] <Quietwalker> novel network?
[09:18:22] <Quietwalker> jong: depends on the context.  An API perhaps?
[09:18:23] <Jong> in cpp, it's usually the header file of a library
[09:18:47] <Quietwalker> the declarations
[09:18:59] <vdamewood> Quietwalker: Novel's system was Novel NetWare
[09:19:09] <Quietwalker> that's it.
[09:19:25] <Quietwalker> for a while, that thing was like magic. Very neat.
[09:19:58] <Quietwalker> it was amusing to see them effectively implement nfs and nis AND yp for windows.
[09:20:50] *** Joins: qbt (~qbt@user/edun)
[09:20:59] <Jong> yeah API I guess is the word
[09:22:04] <Jong> What do you call it when a library changes the parameters of API functions, requiring everyone who uses the API call in question to need to change their code calling the call.
[09:22:17] <Quietwalker> deprecating methods/classes
[09:22:21] <vdamewood> a 'breakingchange'
[09:22:26] <vdamewood> 'breaking change'
[09:22:42] <Quietwalker> usually you make sure they work for a while while announcing loudly that you're making a breaking change.
[09:22:49] <vdamewood> deprecating is what happen when they document that they plan do do that in the future.
[09:22:52] <Quietwalker> yeah
[09:22:54] <vdamewood> happens*
[09:23:44] <Quietwalker> at my company, I make sure our rest frameworks have versioning so even forward changes are persisted because no one uses the damn self-descriptive data types be it XML, JSON or other
[09:23:54] <Jong> vdamewood  "breaking change" is a broader word, because changing api entry point functions is just one example of that
[09:23:59] *** carbolymer_ is now known as carbolymer
[09:24:02] <vdamewood> So, for example, Version 2.0 might have the doo_foo(int, int) function. Version 2.4 will introduce the do_foo_safely(int, int, void*) function, and list do_foo as deprecated. Then in version 3.0 they will remove do_foo entirely.
[09:24:16] <Quietwalker> oh no, if you add a single field, suddenly their "I'll parse by strtok" or whatever method fails.
[09:24:17] <vdamewood> s/doo_foo/do_foo/g
[09:24:37] <Quietwalker> (not that anyone that consumes our rest services uses C that I know of, but you get the idea)
[09:24:45] <Quietwalker> lots of PLC devs,.... oh
[09:24:53] <Quietwalker> this is technical and amusing, and frustrating.
[09:25:49] <Quietwalker> So, we have a very simple message protocol that we use to talk to some hardware in our facilities.  The message protocol is in json, but that's not important to the story.  The communication protocol is int-prefixed size messages.
[09:26:12] <Quietwalker> So, 4 bytes, depending on the PLC, translated via bigendian or littleendian to a size, read that many bytes, and you've got a message.
[09:26:51] <Quietwalker> Failures of any type result in disconnect since there's no mechanism in the protocol to resync.  This means you have to always get it right or it basically never works - so a good "fail fast, fail loudly" implementation.

[09:27:08] <Quietwalker> there's only 1 trick in the entire thing, and that's when we send a size of 0.
[09:27:19] *** Joins: mjs2600 (~mjs2600@c-24-91-3-49.hsd1.vt.comcast.net)
[09:27:37] <Quietwalker> obviously that means to read 0 bytes, process it, and then move to the next message.  In effect, it's a do nothing message with no side effects.  In practice, it's a keepalive.

[09:28:15] <vdamewood> I may have found some extra, unneeded lines in my build scripts.
[09:28:17] <TheLinuxNerd_otg> I'm getting a TI-nSpire CX II CAS :-) 
[09:28:19] <Quietwalker> okay, so we have any number of machines using the same socket connection to communicate. Great.  On my side, it's doing the "right thing".  Buffers the input until byte size is reached, dispatches a handler for the message, grabs the next 4, etc.
[09:28:57] <Quietwalker> I found out today that about half of the PLCs were just coded with a polling interval and they treat whatever's in the buffer as a full message, after parsing out any 4-byte "garbage" strings they find preceding or following.
[09:29:12] <Quietwalker> and suddenly this loss of about 3.6% of message responses makes sense.
[09:30:04] <Quietwalker> sometimes there's 2 messages to process, and they only do 1.  They do all their 'parsing' via string operators, not via a library to parse & process the message (like a json lib).  And they never buffer for size (and tcp says it can split up packets)

[13:53:21] <LiaoTao> extern, If you set n = 3 and follow the substitution rules you arrive at 2*alpha + gamma
[13:53:50] <LiaoTao> It's even in the table

[15:11:53] <Guest82> to contact previous collegues
[15:12:02] <InPhase> Guest82: Well reference check questions tend to just be asking someone to confirm a person worked there, asking them what work they did (to make sure it matches up to the resume reasonably closely), and asking them things about what it was like to work with you.  It's usually not "Can this person do this new job?" but questions about the past job.

[15:14:47] <InPhase> Guest82: They're just checking to see if the people you think are references in fact declare you a toxic employee, or something like that.  But this is why you ask people to be a reference, as most people will only agree when they feel they have good things to say about you.

[15:55:00] <InPhase> pyzozord: I also had an employment gap myself after moving across the country with my family when my wife got a position first in our two-body job search, and when it took a little bit of time to line up a professor position.  I explained it to every person who asked that I had a secure position, but moved with family, and I decided to take a gamble on my skills and focus on hunting for the type of 
[15:55:06] <InPhase> position I really wanted.  Everyone accepted this.

[16:20:21] <dTal> even though it says *roughly* what's in them on the roll, there's definite variation in printing performance. Ergo, different compositions.

[22:09:05] <[itchyjunk]> Feds confiscate a lot of stuff and never return it.
[22:09:17] <[itchyjunk]> It's expensive to challange them in court so people just give up on it.
[22:09:20] <manicennui> Not just the feds.

[22:09:26] <sonny> us gov  sites vary a lot
[22:09:37] <manicennui> And cities.
[22:09:40] <[itchyjunk]> States hardly steal at the same scale.
[22:09:53] <[itchyjunk]> States steal a few million worth of stuff a year generally.
[22:10:03] <[itchyjunk]> Feds do it at 100's of million scale.
[22:10:08] <sonny> the more you know eh
[22:10:40] <[itchyjunk]> Some officer got in trouble few years ago.
[22:11:01] <[itchyjunk]> He "seized" 10M worth of shit and filed paperwork that showed he lost like 9M of it
[22:11:05] <[itchyjunk]> for w/e reason.
[22:11:15] <sonny> classic
[22:11:24] <[itchyjunk]> And one account linked to him had ~9M worth of money magically pop up

[22:11:41] <sonny> guess he doesn't watch movies 
[22:11:42] <[itchyjunk]> you know what happened? the feds took most of his money
[22:12:06] <[itchyjunk]> he didn't know he was being investigates is my guess
[22:12:28] <[itchyjunk]> not a lot of people who have the power to investigate feds, so they don't have much to owrry about generally
[22:12:45] <sonny> that, or maybe the bank flagged him for security reasons idk
[22:13:02] <[itchyjunk]> no, offshore account
[22:13:07] <sonny> ohh
[22:13:11] <[itchyjunk]> they don't flag shit, that's why they are called that
[22:13:19] <[itchyjunk]> and it was distributed in like a 100 different ones
[22:13:24] <[itchyjunk]> that's why they only got most of it
[22:13:25] <sonny> I thought he went offshore -> local account
[22:13:32] <[itchyjunk]> when get gets out, he'll still have a mill or so

[22:13:38] <sonny> right
[22:14:08] <LambdaComplex> >While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity.
[22:14:26] <LambdaComplex> tldr the cops steal your money, charge the money with a crime, and you have to prove the money wasn't gonna be used in a crime
[22:14:30] <LambdaComplex> (so much for innocent until proven guilty?)

[22:15:05] <LambdaComplex> yes
[22:15:07] <[itchyjunk]> so it never adds up to the amount the feds take

[22:23:22] <sonny> int + float
[22:23:25] <[itchyjunk]> oh so java is also weekly typed?
[22:23:34] <manicennui> No.
[22:23:34] <whatsupdoc> manicennui yes i think i am
[22:23:36] <jeaye> Java is more strongly typed than C.
[22:23:39] <sonny> ^
[22:23:39] <whatsupdoc> manicennui thanks
[22:23:43] <jeaye> It's a sliding scale.
[22:23:49] <manicennui> C is weakly typed because you can do whatever the fuck you want with a chunk of memory.
[22:24:06] <manicennui> And you have shit like void pointers.
[22:24:24] <[itchyjunk]> but 1+1.0 works in java
[22:24:28] <jeaye> C and Java are both statically typed, but types in C are very minimal and easy to get around. Java's type system is richer and provides more safety, so it's considered stronger.
[22:24:33] <manicennui> That has nothing to do with strong typing.
[22:24:38] <sonny> strongly typed pretty much means you only allow operations on the same type
[22:24:46] <[itchyjunk]> ah

[22:39:11] <sonny> if you delay until runtime, you don't have the same ability to make the contraints
[22:39:18] <InPhase> manicennui: The dispute is that behaviors are not constrained by type, nor is dispatch done by type, in Python.
[22:39:27] <sonny> that's what dynamic typing is
[22:40:03] <manicennui> You do have the ability to constrain behavior. The fact that it happens at runtime doesn't change that.
[22:40:08] <manicennui> And the fact that it can be changed.
[22:40:13] <sonny> how?
[22:40:15] <manicennui> All you are arguing is that it is not static.
[22:40:15] <Decker> I can constrain types used (in JS for example) at runtime.. (or C really with RTTI)

[22:40:43] <InPhase> manicennui: I guess you are in that Python view then.  But this loses most of the utility of strong typing constraints.
[22:40:43] <[itchyjunk]> but beyond that, i dont userstand the issue
[22:41:01] <manicennui> InPhase: No, it loses the abilities of STATIC typing.

[22:47:45] <manicennui> You just don't like it because it is not part of the function signature.
[22:47:51] <sonny> so you create a type to represent a week, Tuesday + 1 can be defined only for objects of type week, in a dynamic language this is not possible
[22:48:00] <InPhase> manicennui: Yes, you can inspect types and generate your own errors.  That's not strong typing, that's having types and writing conditional logic.
[22:48:03] <manicennui> sonny: Of course it is.

[22:49:27] <manicennui> If you want it to return Wednesday, that is completely possible.
[22:49:37] <sonny> Tuesday + 1 = Wednesday
[22:50:09] <manicennui> I don't know why you think the + operator/method can't be defined for things other than built-in types.

[22:51:10] *** Joins: cn--j (~cn-j@user/cn-j)
[22:51:12] <Decker> the ability to add an operator/syntax support to a type doesn't make it strong
[22:51:17] <manicennui> It probably wouldn't be done in a way that you like, which is what you really want to argue about.
[22:51:19] <InPhase> manicennui: You know full well of course that 99% of Python function parameters are not checked.  Because the language does not support it, and because it would balloon code out of control to repetitively implement your own manual type checking everywhere, it goes undone.  A strongly typed language is one that supports this in a built-in manner so that there is a support infrastructure for types.  
[22:51:25] <InPhase> You can implement strong typing in assembly language too, but obviously assembly languages are not strongly typed.
[22:51:31] <manicennui> Decker: I claimed that it was possible, not that it made it strong.
[22:51:59] <sonny> there is no operator overloading here
[22:52:00] <manicennui> InPhase: And because it is unnecessary. No one cares about satisfying static typing advocates.
[22:52:09] <[itchyjunk]> One issue for me is that you seem to need to know more than one language to study programming language generically
[22:52:19] <sonny> ya
[22:52:21] <[itchyjunk]> else you can't really compare and contrast languages
[22:52:27] <InPhase> manicennui: It is very important to lock down behavior when writing larger programs.  Constraints are a major architectural design tool for managing complexity.
[22:52:33] <sonny> pl books usually have a few
[22:52:36] <[itchyjunk]> but then, learning some weird details about java seems kinda useless
[22:52:48] <sonny> not if you are working in it
[22:53:03] <sonny> underscores for numbers is always a fun fact
[22:53:08] <manicennui> InPhase: There are many ways to implement constraints, and most type systems are not capable of the types of constraints that matter.
[22:53:15] <InPhase> manicennui: Languages without this require far more tests just to repeatedly check things in all sorts of different conditions to make sure there aren't hidden bugs that would be managed automatically with better constraints.

[22:54:23] <InPhase> manicennui: In a strongly typed language you can design from the ground-up for those constraints lining up exactly at the boundaries that DO matter.  All components should be designed with this in mind, so that all components offer specified guarantees, and type constraints then guarantee that you're using the components that have these guarantees, layering guarantees on guarantees.
[22:54:24] <manicennui> Because most problems in software are not typing problems.
[22:54:40] <sonny> it is, that is why dropbox created mypy
[22:54:49] <sonny> microsoft created typescript
[22:54:51] <sonny> etc
[22:55:04] <manicennui> You are free to believe whatever you like.
[22:55:17] <manicennui> I'll continue to make money with dynamic languages.

[22:55:45] <[itchyjunk]> well, that part, is hard to know
[22:55:56] <[itchyjunk]> how does one know what class of problem is common or not?
[22:56:03] <InPhase> manicennui: I'll admit it took me 20 years of programming to figure out how to architect code with constraints and guarantees like this.  But it's really empowering.  And the lack of it in a language like Python definitely gets in the way of quickly writing robust larger programs.
[22:56:04] <manicennui> Immutability and not allowing nullability solve a larger class of problems.

[22:56:23] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, but how do you run such studies?
[22:56:26] <sonny> experience, history
[22:56:31] <sonny> I dunno, but they do
[22:56:38] <[itchyjunk]> yes but experience in some specific language
[22:56:48] <sonny> m$ probably has a wealth of information on that
[22:56:51] <[itchyjunk]> how do you make a blanket statement about programming in generaly
[22:56:55] <manicennui> InPhase: It didn't take me 20 years to realize that software developers love to focus on the wrong things.
[22:57:28] <sonny> [itchyjunk] I guess that is called being an expert
[22:57:55] <sonny> which probably involes you having gone through many languages
[22:58:14] <manicennui> But if you go through many languages and come to a different solution, then you are somehow just wrong.
[22:58:24] <manicennui> s/solution/conclusion/
[22:58:36] <sonny> not sure what you mean
[22:58:52] <manicennui> I mean that the whole "I've done this a long time, therefore I am right" argument is asinine.
[22:59:00] <InPhase> manicennui: Actually immutability and not allowing nullability are well within what most strongly typed languages can provide as guarantees.  I'm not sure why you claimed the opposite, but these are both important parts of using strong typing in architectural design.
[22:59:13] <sonny> not sure who made that claim ...
[22:59:24] <manicennui> InPhase: There are very few popular statically typed languages that even attempt to deal with those issues.
[22:59:33] <InPhase> manicennui: C++ does it fine?

[22:59:43] <manicennui> InPhase: It is within the capabilities of static and dynamically typed languages.
[22:59:49] <manicennui> InPhase: No it doesn't.
[22:59:55] <InPhase> manicennui: I do it in C++ all the time, so...
[23:00:05] <manicennui> Yes, and I could do it in Ruby too.
[23:00:13] <manicennui> That doesn't mean Ruby does it fine.
[23:00:20] <InPhase> And the language intrinsically supports designing for this.
[23:00:28] <sonny> [itchyjunk] any example of statements btw?
[23:00:30] <InPhase> The whole concept of references is based around non-nullability.
[23:00:57] <InPhase> The whole "const correctness" concept is based around immutability guarantees.
[23:01:19] <manicennui> Again, it can be done in many languages.
[23:01:38] <InPhase> You can also make custom types that provide non-nullability guarantees, and apply strong typing guarantees that they will be used.
[23:01:40] <manicennui> That doesn't mean those languages did a good job of handling it.
[23:02:27] <InPhase> And by doing so you guarantee that within a series of function calls, your object will not be null, will be properly initialized, and will satisfy all of its invariants.
[23:02:28] <manicennui> A language that does it well would make immutability the default, and not allow nulls by default.
[23:02:48] <manicennui> I know you know that most C++ code is riddled with mutability and pointers.
[23:03:08] <InPhase> manicennui: C++ supports both good programming and bad programming.  What is important is that it supports good programming.
[23:03:29] <manicennui> InPhase: You could make that argument about many languages, static or dynamic.

[23:40:04] <sonny> should've tried emacs :P
[23:40:08] <pulse> intellisense instantly probes all your library headers and actually understands them
[23:40:11] <pulse> it's a joy to work with
[23:40:24] <pulse> pyzozord, yeah. maybe
[23:40:26] <pulse> i've given up on it
[23:40:34] <pulse> vscode is my goto for C++ on Linux
[23:40:36] <tane> I think vscode's "develop inside docker container" is a really cool feature
[23:40:37] <pyzozord> when I was using vim I wasn'y usinc coc though I was using some other plugin I forget the name, effect was the same really, connecting to language servers and what not
[23:40:38] <pulse> but i use Vim for most anything esle
[23:40:44] <tane> maybe there's a vim plugin too, but it all works out of the box
[23:41:00] <sonny> I use whatever
[23:41:10] <kre10s> pyzozord: break *0x8007e6 That asterisk! facepalm
[23:41:21] <novns> vscode is too nice to use anything else
[23:41:25] <pulse> i mean i'm a daily vim user, i love it. but i can't use it for C++ because it's too primitive
[23:41:27] <novns> except vscodium
[23:41:30] <sonny> I think vscode is probably the closest to emacs
[23:41:38] <manicennui> What?
[23:41:44] <sonny> then again, vim is probably easier to configure
[23:41:49] * sonny shrugs
[23:41:56] <pulse> sonny, no, it's not :p
[23:42:04] <pulse> vim has a steep curve in anything you do with it
[23:42:04] <sonny> what is?
[23:42:09] <sonny> oh ok
[23:42:15] <sonny> neovim has lua
[23:43:20] <novns> sonny, you don't have to press Meta+Alt+Ctrl+Shift+Dump+Vomit+s in vscode to save a file like you do in emacs
[23:43:30] <pyzozord> kre10s: oh didn't know that, nice. I guess break if would work too 
[23:43:31] <sonny> emacs is probably the best development environment right now, but due to it's difficulty vscode makes sense
[23:43:40] <sonny> that is true

[23:44:18] <pyzozord> and one I don't think is worth it
[23:44:24] <sonny> me either
[23:44:31] <pyzozord> unless you are really in it for life
[23:44:40] <manicennui> Isn't pyzozord arguing for vi?
[23:44:42] <tane> as long as an editor has a proper vim emulation layer it's usually alright
[23:44:48] <novns> vi was good on bad teletypes
[23:44:52] <sonny> but I like unix, so I accept it
[23:44:59] <pulse> most vim emulations kinda suck though
[23:45:14] <tane> sure, but they're sufficient to make it bearable
[23:45:19] <manicennui> I found doom emacs to be almost usable.
[23:45:21] <pyzozord> im using my vi fork now, but I'm quite sure I'll write my own editor from scratch
[23:45:33] <sonny> why use an emulator if you are not a hardcore vimmer :P
[23:45:46] <sonny> emacs is better vanilla
[23:45:55] <sonny> but then, you actually have to learn it
[23:46:04] <pyzozord> I'm not a fan of autocompletion
[23:46:07] <manicennui> I have been using vim for over 5 years now.
[23:46:08] <sonny> ehh
[23:46:10] <pyzozord> and languages that expect it

[23:46:20] <pyzozord> pulse: no I do not :D
[23:46:20] <pulse> autocomplete is magnificent
[23:46:26] <sonny> not autocomplete ?!
[23:46:28] <novns> vim is one way ticket, once you start it you can never exit
[23:46:28] <pyzozord> same with java. I stay clear of that stuff
[23:46:39] <sonny> what if you want employment? lol
[23:46:42] <pulse> novns, untrue, i regularly jump between vim, VS, notepad++, vscode, etc.
[23:46:44] <manicennui> I do not use autocomplete either.
[23:46:52] <pulse> i've used vim for close to a decade now
[23:47:16] <tane> pulse, do you have vim mode enabled in vscode?
[23:47:18] <pulse> i'd rather become a professional diving instructor than write C++ without autocomplete ......
[23:47:25] <novns> pulse, it takes 20 years of hard learning to get the knowledge required to press :q!
[23:47:28] <pulse> tane, sometimes, but it's not as good as real vim
[23:47:30] <manicennui> I just avoid writing C++.
[23:47:32] *** Quits: MickOfRivia (~Thunderbi@user/mickofrivia) (Client Quit)
[23:47:41] <sonny> sublime text is fast, nice ui and defaults, but it's hard to configure ...
[23:47:47] <LiaoTao> manicennui, +1 and I've got decades of experience
[23:47:54] <pulse> i love C++
[23:47:57] <pulse> it's my favorite language
[23:48:03] <novns> but C++ hates you
[23:48:03] <manicennui> How is sublime hard to configure?
[23:48:08] <pyzozord> heh
[23:48:11] <pulse> novns, :D
[23:48:21] <sonny> ok, maybe emacs is just really easy to configure then
[23:48:47] <pulse> yes but emacs requires three steam pressure valves, mechanical pedals, and a periscope from a 1960s submarine
[23:48:49] <sonny> I want to add a parser to it, so I can get better highlighting
[23:48:55] <sonny> lmao
[23:48:55] <novns> the one and only proper editor is mcedit from the midnight commander
[23:49:04] <pyzozord> pulse: and a monocle, don't forget the monocle
[23:49:06] <manicennui> Take someone who has never used emacs nor sublime and ask them to configure each.
[23:49:20] <manicennui> And don't give them documentation.
[23:49:21] <sonny> also the bracket complete feature is not flexible
[23:49:21] <pyzozord> although that sounds more like 1690 than 1960 :P
[23:49:26] <manicennui> They'll probably never figure out emacs
[23:49:40] <manicennui> Sublime will take about a minute.
[23:49:50] <sonny> no it won't
[23:49:50] <pyzozord> oh nevermind it was just periscope that was from 1960
[23:50:39] <pyzozord> pulse: what things do you like about c++?
[23:50:45] <sonny> not documentation makes that a useless challenge for both editors 
[23:50:47] *** Quits: GeDaMo (~GeDaMo@user/gedamo) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:50:52] <manicennui> Sublime's configuration is in the default place on OS X and Windows.
[23:50:59] <manicennui> A couple of clicks in a menu.
[23:51:06] <sonny> same for emacs
[23:51:16] <sonny> but I'd lick to do more than a couple clicks
[23:51:22] <sonny> s/lick/like/

[23:52:58] <pulse> sonny, depends how many plugins you tack onto it
[23:53:01] <pyzozord> pulse: I guess I was curious about specific c++ features

[23:53:27] <novns> is it capable at all?
[23:53:32] <pulse> pyzozord, oh. well imagine Java, except you have global scope, super powerful meta capabilities, and no bytecode ;)
[23:53:39] <sonny> capable of what?
[23:54:09] <novns> of highlighting modified lines and files
[23:54:13] <pyzozord> pulse: oh so you like the object classes and templates?
[23:54:19] <sonny> yeah
[23:54:21] <pulse> pyzozord, yes

[23:54:30] <bayaz> Title: Git Integration â€“ Sublime Text Documentation 
[23:54:32] <pulse> pyzozord, also, the STL is incredibly powerful on its own
[23:54:36] <pyzozord> pulse: any of the c11+ stuff?
[23:54:39] <pulse> well, apart from std::string still not having split()
[23:54:44] <pulse> pyzozord, yes, it's great
[23:54:51] <pulse> i loved c++98 too
[23:54:54] <sonny> isn't that a locale problem?
[23:54:56] <pulse> but since c++11 it's just gotten so much better
[23:55:02] <sonny> I think lua does not have a string split either
[23:55:12] <manicennui> novns: The rest of that page answers your other questions.
[23:55:22] <pyzozord> pulse: what are your fav features from c++11+?
[23:55:27] <pulse> sonny, i think std::string::split is planned for C++9999 :p
[23:55:37] <pulse> pyzozord, smart pointers, obviously
[23:55:39] <sonny> lol
[23:55:42] <novns> manicennui, but it's just Git.  what about other source control things?
[23:55:45] <pulse> lambda expressions are nice too
[23:55:51] <manicennui> novns: Pfft.
[23:55:52] <pyzozord> is that c++11? I thought this was 98
[23:55:59] <pulse> nope, c++11
[23:56:02] <sonny> novns they have another product for it, was really nice
[23:56:04] <pulse> well c++98 + boost could do it too
[23:56:13] <sonny> I'll probably buy it at some point
[23:56:23] <pyzozord> pulse: other things? C++ has many crazy features
[23:56:32] <sonny> what's weird though, is that they did not try to work on lsp stuff
[23:56:34] <pulse> pyzozord, too many to list
[23:56:46] <sonny> kate is better than sublime text, and it's cheaper too afaik
[23:57:15] <sonny> they have lsp support for c++, go, and rust
[23:57:26] <sonny> and it is feasible to add your own
[23:57:32] <pulse> pyzozord, C++ is the type of language where if you have an idea for a complex type, you can usually implement it
[23:57:40] <pulse> which is what makes it so powerful
[23:57:43] <pulse> you can build your own building blocks
[23:57:52] <sonny> at this point, sublime text is just pretty and fast :P
[23:57:55] <pulse> want a custom allocator? you can do that
[23:58:12] *** Joins: Nspace (~Nspace@user/nspace)
[23:58:17] <pulse> want a custom datastructure with defined iterator behavior? just roll your own
[23:58:42] <pulse> want a compile-time miracle so you shave some nanoseconds from runtime? just do it
[23:58:43] <pulse> etc.
[23:58:45] <manicennui> I don't want to think about allocation.
[23:58:46] <sonny> in a lot of my interests, c++ is used
[23:58:48] <pulse> it's a ridiculously powerful language
[23:58:55] <sonny> so I can't avoid it 
[23:59:06] <novns> want 3 days of debugging a small typo in a 3rd party template library - C++ is for you
[23:59:18] <kre10s> novns: ++
[23:59:24] <pulse> lol
[23:59:53] <pulse> want 30 pages of template errors from missing a single semicolon? C++ got you covered ;)
[23:59:57] <manicennui> Want to never use a standard newer than 10 years old? C++ is for you.
[23:59:58] <sonny> I get what c++ had to do (sorta), but man it's a monstrosity
