[04:26:17] <gilberth> hayley: Hello! Sorry, I was away yesterday.
[04:28:47] <hayley> Here we are, dynamic race detection for C++11 https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/homepages/papers/pdfs/2017/POPL.pdf
[04:36:13] <hayley> And another detector for Java which claims to be a magnitude faster than your typical vector clock device: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.2759&rep=rep1&type=pdf
[04:38:17] <hayley> My dream is that I make some change to a function in a package, and either a race "linter" runs some small pre-written tests and/or generates them from constraints. 
[04:39:02] <gilberth> What is a vector clock?
[04:40:18] <hayley> A way of checking causal consistency. Each message in a distributed system is annotated with a vector clock, which contains a "timestamp" from every thread. Causal consistency is held iff every message a thread receives has monotonically increasing clocks.

[04:42:19] <dave0> maw
[04:42:31] <gilberth> Hello dave0!
[04:42:46] <dave0> maw gilberth 
[04:42:55] <Lulu> maw
[04:43:54] <hayley> Yes.
[04:44:17] *** Joins: lad (~lad@user/lad)
[04:44:38] <gilberth> Yes?
[04:44:42] <hayley> Wait, no, each thread has a full vector clock, i.e. n clocks per thread.
[04:45:40] <dave0> maw Lulu 
[04:45:42] <gilberth> I am puzzled. Who stamps? The sender or the receiver?
[04:47:00] <hayley> A message send causes the thread to increment its own counter in its own clock, and the receiver takes (mapcar #'max receiver-clock message-clock)
[04:48:09] <gilberth> Ah.
[04:53:09] <hayley> But it's a bit different with mutable variables rather than messages, and with your average C++/Java memory model.
[04:55:52] <hayley> sigh The Java paper only covers locks and not any ole atomics. But I like the idea that safe programs have valid clocks, and so you can replace a vector comparison with a scalar-vector comparison.
[05:15:38] <hayley> Rather any shared word (in a CL realisation I would say any place) is annotated with a vector clock, so evidently the memory usage blows up by some large constant. 
[05:22:48] * hayley also wonders how possibly out-of-order operations are handled, e.g. there isn't a happens-before between two reads. Perhaps we only increment our clock on a memory fence?

[22:32:54] <gilberth> Well, there is a reason why I decided to call my toy Lisp the Nocturnal Lisp.
[22:33:05] <pjb> There area lot of them: ðŸš€
[22:33:30] <treflip> And its name is "BLACK SMILING FACE"
[22:33:38] <gilberth> pjb: Whatever, I could also call them "funny characters, I can't read.".
[22:33:44] <treflip> So it shouldn't be pale :)
[22:34:56] <gilberth> treflip: It's pale here, but my text is white on black, because black on white I cannot read. So perhaps they should have called that "+foreground-ink+ smiling face".
[22:36:50] <gilberth> Anyhow, it'll be more PS hacking for me today^Wtonight.
[22:41:09] <pjb> gilberth: so the paleness is in your own eyes and devices.
[22:42:43] <pjb> gilberth: (progn (set-foreground-color "tan4") (set-background-color "white")) 
[22:44:59] <gilberth> I assume that is elisp, and thus it won't work here.
[22:45:21] <pjb> no emacs? How strange.
[22:45:47] <pjb> I assume your edit can do at least the same and you can change the colors.
[22:46:19] <treflip> Ah, I have the same problem. Can't stare at the text with white background for a long time. Yet I like when the text itself is black. So I set gray or tan background everywhere.
[22:46:32] <gilberth> A CSS rule would do, but as I said: I cannot read black on white for some strange reason.
[22:47:17] <gilberth> treflip: I just cannot read it. Zilch. All doctors just shrugged about it.
[22:48:20] <treflip> 0_o
[22:49:01] <gilberth> And yes, I always used a dark background. I find it funny that you find that on web pages more and more.

[23:43:04] <pl> It depends on many factors, including how bright is the environment

[23:43:51] <shka> dunno if there is any science behind it
[23:49:53] <aeth> and the monitor
[23:50:02] <aeth> black on white isn't
[23:50:26] <aeth> on my desktop monitors, it's painfully obvious when something is gray instead of black
[23:50:47] <shka> one of my monitors has fucked up colors
[23:50:57] <shka> something with saturation
[23:50:58] <aeth> on my OLED smartphone, it doesn't look as out of place... except it completely negates the entire point of OLED to use something other than #x000000
[23:51:01] <shka> but i don't care
[23:51:18] <aeth> not using true black turns an OLED screen into yet another crappy screen that can't do true black
[23:51:19] *** Joins: lad (~lad@user/lad)
[23:51:48] <aeth> so either you have (1) an OLED/etc. with the ability for true black and off-black is readable but makes your screen look worse
[23:52:10] <aeth> or (2) you don't have a screen that can do black colors very well so off-black is some degree of not-very-readable
[23:52:33] <aeth> either "black on white" (gray on white) is a terrible idea and every modern designer should be fired and unemployable
[23:52:50] <aeth> High contrast is good.
[23:53:26] <aeth> dark themes are even worse
[23:53:56] <aeth> Wikipedia's Android app seems to be white-on-black, but virtually every non-terminal/emacs dark theme I've seen (website, desktop, mobile) is just white on some kind of *medium* (not even dark) gray.
[23:54:03] <aeth> including my Firefox window right now
[23:54:16] <aeth> (and Firefox on Android)
[23:55:55] <aeth> Modern design does some things so right (font selection, kerning, lack of gradients, etc.) and some things so wrong (color selection, excess padding, inability to distinguish a button from text, etc.)
[23:57:32] <shka> the worst part is lack of consistency 
[23:57:51] <shka> people simply put stuff wherever they see fit
[23:58:28] <shka> which sometimes is justified and logical, but if UI requires thinking is not the best UI
[23:58:44] <shka> the worst offender is perhaps clickup web app
[23:58:52] <aeth> no, it's that they don't let consistency develop
[23:58:54] <shka> this shit made me miss jira of all things
[23:58:57] <aeth> they have to redesign every few years
[23:59:20] <aeth> turns out when you have a team of designers that you pay, they have to keep justifying their existence even if they've done their job
[23:59:32] <shka> they literally have interactive elements on every edge of screen
