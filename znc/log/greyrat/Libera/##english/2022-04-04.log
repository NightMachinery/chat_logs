[03:21:18] <MetaNova> seems fine

[03:21:28] <blkshp> I'd remove the "one" but that's just semantics
[03:21:42] <twb> I would put a comma before "and"

[20:39:00] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, I don't think he says "cain"
[20:39:22] <CuriosTiger> although in British English, "can" has an /æ/ like in cat, and "can't" has an /a/ like in car.
[20:39:28] <CuriosTiger> So in BrE, that's pretty disambiguated already.
[20:40:05] <CuriosTiger> and that particular pronunciation difference screws with my brain, because they're altering the vowel of the SAME word depending on whether or not it's used in a contraction.

[23:08:26] <CuriosTiger> The one that made me do a double take in AusE was "thongs"
[23:08:48] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: A type of footwear
[23:09:04] <blkshp> Not anywhere else lol
[23:09:09] <CuriosTiger> Yes. Not a type of underwear.
[23:09:11] <dumptrucktaco> "Flip-Flops"
[23:09:24] <blkshp> flop-flips
[23:09:29] <darsie> kurahaupo: thanks
[23:09:31] <dumptrucktaco> Flip-Flaps
[23:09:33] <CuriosTiger> I heard my cousin ask his 4-year-old son to grab his "thongs" and I was like...wait, what?
[23:09:38] <dumptrucktaco> o.O
[23:09:55] <blkshp> Stop leaving your thongs on the kitchen floor.
[23:09:59] <huf> the old name for that here was "vietnamese slippers"
[23:10:09] <huf> i dont know what people call it now :D
[23:10:17] <CuriosTiger> They're 'sandals' or 'flip-flops' here.
[23:10:21] <kurahaupo> "Thong" simply means a strip of fabric or leather, twisted to make a strong rope-like segment. That could be used as part of a garment on many parts of the body
[23:10:38] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: In the US, it's a somewhat X-rated term.
[23:10:48] <CuriosTiger> something you'd buy for your girlfriend at a lingerie store.
[23:11:06] <CuriosTiger> it would be inappropriate to even say in front of children.
[23:11:07] <CuriosTiger> :P
[23:11:17] <huf> ... now that's some american sensibilities
[23:11:18] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: Because it has all the back fabric rolled up into a thong
[23:11:41] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: I get the etymological origin, but the cultural significance is still very different.
[23:11:48] <kurahaupo> who tf would feel comfortable wearing that?
[23:11:52] <CuriosTiger> huf: I have a web comic that demonstrates that perfectly. hold on.
[23:12:16] <CuriosTiger> huf: https://satwcomic.com/anything-but-that
[23:12:22] <CuriosTiger> huf: Perfectly summarized.
[23:14:37] <dumptrucktaco> CuriosTiger - They sell thongs at Walmart and Target along with regular "full coverage" underwear.  
[23:15:36] <CuriosTiger> They sell condoms, too. But I'd still do a double-take if my cousin had told his 4-year-old to go get his condoms.
[23:16:02] <dTal> you'd take two condoms?
[23:16:07] <dumptrucktaco> Although thongs do look usually provide a nicer view whenever there is lingerie involved. 
[23:16:17] <huf> telling your kid to buy a thing is perhaps different from telling them the thing exists
[23:16:28] <huf> but who knows
[23:17:24] <CuriosTiger> Sure.
[23:17:45] <CuriosTiger> huf: Did you read the web comic?
[23:17:49] <huf> yeah
[23:18:50] <CuriosTiger> I think it sums up the difference between European and American sensibilities pretty well

[23:29:47] <kurahaupo> paul424: Isn't the "except for Scotland, Northern Island, and Wales" trope a joke about the English habit of thinking that England is the whole of Britain? As in "All of Britain except for all the bits that aren't England".

[23:30:38] <huf> northern island :D

[23:30:46] <huf> NORN IRON pls
[23:30:55] <blkshp> Northern Ireland is not Britain.
[23:31:01] <blkshp> Sorry, Norn Iron
[23:31:47] <kurahaupo> Voxel: "been started searching" doesn't work because "be" takes a present participle, but "started" is a past participle. You could say "they may have already been searching" or "they may have already started searching"
[23:34:00] <kurahaupo> sorry, my keyboard's corrected Irland to Island instead of Ireland.
[23:35:18] <kurahaupo> (And coming from a country that comprises The North Island and The South island, I'm afraid I didn't think it looked out of place.)
[23:45:46] <blkshp> :D
