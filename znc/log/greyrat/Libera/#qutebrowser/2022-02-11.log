[03:44:36] <natris1979[m]> so I'm experiencing this issue, I think: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/7015#issuecomment-1035615748. This may be correlation/not causation but it looks like requests to https://github.githubassets.com/assets/optimizely-ee113889.js are being blocked. I tried turning off adblock and it's still blocked. Is there any way to troubleshot why that url is blocked? Optimiizely is a split test company, so I could certainly
[03:44:36] <natris1979[m]> see things being broken if it can't tell I'm in a split test or not
[03:45:05] <natris1979[m]> I have seen the "this browser is not supported" errors before and it's never been a problem until today
[03:45:59] *** Joins: noex (~null@user/noex)
[03:47:30] <natris1979[m]> interestingly the githubassets url is only blocked when fetched from other pages. I can navigate there directly in qutebrowser just fine
[03:48:48] <mornfall> maybe some trigger-happy referrer policy?
[03:55:25] <natris1979[m]> but blocked by client implies that it's my browser that's doing the blocking. I don't know about anything that would be configured client side that would be referer related
[03:55:47] <natris1979[m]> strangely, chrome and firefox don't even try to get that optimizely file
[03:56:25] <natris1979[m]> I tried clearing my cookies in qutebrowser, in case I got opted into some broken split test, but I get the same behavior
[03:58:59] <natris1979[m]> what the heck. now I refresh, things are still broken but I don't it trying to fetch https://github.githubassets.com/assets/optimizely-ee113889.js anymore.
[04:05:10] <natris1979[m]> I don't *see it

[11:59:40] <The-Compiler> See https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/7015#issuecomment-1035975151 re the GitHub issue FWIW
[12:04:37] <toofar> +1, nice essay. I was just thinking about flatpack in relation to that. Not that I have ever used it
[12:08:23] <The-Compiler> also writing to GitHub Support to ask what they changed. Probably not going to get an useful answer, but I've been surprised before
[12:16:12] <toofar> Bags not. Although I did look at the support link and didn't see a relevant discussion category.

[13:09:44] <root____> hey, how can I block range of ips? I'd like to block all google, just to see how the web looks and works after.
[13:10:47] *** root____ is now known as shadowbird234
[13:12:04] <shadowbird234> would I do it in qutebrowser/blocked-hosts?
[13:13:38] <The-Compiler> shadowbird234: add the hostnames to blocked-hosts in qutebrowser's config dir (see :version) and set content.blocking.method to both
[13:14:35] <shadowbird234> if I wanted to block 173.194.0.0 - 173.194.255.255 for example. does this format work?
[13:14:46] <The-Compiler> only if you list them one by one
[13:14:59] <shadowbird234> hm, I see
[13:15:47] <The-Compiler> I suppose you could get more creative with ABP-like filters instead
[13:16:03] <The-Compiler> you can add a file:// URL to content.blocking.adblock.lists
[13:16:50] <shadowbird234> okey, I'll look into that. thanks!

[15:38:16] <zeraphel> can qutebrowser copy 'links to highlighted text' ?
[15:43:54] <The-Compiler> zeraphel: I don't understand what you mean by that
[15:44:01] <zeraphel> stuff like this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia#:~:text=but%20criticism%20for%20exhibiting%20systemic%20bias
[15:44:25] <zeraphel> qutebrowser does open them just fine
[15:46:19] <The-Compiler> oh, nifty
[15:46:47] <The-Compiler> I remember reading about that some while ago, had no idea qutebrowser supports it
[15:46:54] *** Joins: root____ (~root@85-76-79-161-nat.elisa-mobile.fi)
[15:47:53] <The-Compiler> as far as I know, QtWebEngine does not expose that functionality - but we can ask them to, and perhaps reimplement it too. Mind opening an issue with that example link?
[15:48:16] * zeraphel poor old me is not on github
[15:48:25] <The-Compiler> ok, I'll do so then
[15:48:37] <zeraphel> thank you! :)
[15:48:42] <tiosgz`> do you think it has to be done in QWE?
[15:49:10] <The-Compiler> argh I messed up :D
[15:49:13] <The-Compiler> https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/7016
[15:51:16] <The-Compiler> tiosgz`: not necessarily, hence the "perhaps reimplement it too" part
[15:51:16] <zeraphel> The-Compiler: awesome! :)
[15:51:35] <root____> does qutebrowser/blocked-hosts understand format like 74.125.* ?
[15:51:43] <The-Compiler> root____: I forgot
[15:51:51] <The-Compiler> root____: I remember someone wanted to do that
[15:51:52] *** root____ is now known as shadowbird234
[15:52:19] <tiosgz`> The-Compiler: ah, i'm bad at interpreting the subject/wossit :)
[15:53:17] <The-Compiler> tiosgz`: but it's likely easier for QtWebEngine to do this than it is for qutebrowser, as they can just expose the underlying Chromium functionality, while qutebrowser has to reimplement the algorithm
[15:53:39] <The-Compiler> shadowbird234: nope, looks like it does not
[15:54:48] <shadowbird234> yea, I thought so. wondering if that could be modified somehow into functional format
[15:55:30] <tiosgz`> The-Compiler: nothing world-breaking i'd say, just #:~:text= plus url-encoded text, but of course even that takes a bit of effort
[15:58:32] <The-Compiler> tiosgz`: https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/link-to-text-fragment/blob/main/fragment-generation-utils.js begs to differ
[15:58:54] <The-Compiler> shadowbird234: why not use ABP-style rules instead?
[15:59:19] <tiosgz`> ah well XD
[15:59:58] <The-Compiler> tiosgz`: note that you can select a longer text, and the link includes an unique prefix and suffix, not the whole text
[16:00:50] * tiosgz` hides in shame
[16:03:19] <shadowbird234> I could do that. Just need to do some research first. I'm not fumiliar with adb rules yet.
