[07:50:25] <Siente> My goal is creating a web vulnerability scanner as a final project at university in cyber security, not a commercial product, just a basic one.

[07:53:45] <Siente> Well first I am wondering if I should focus on dealing with modern web applications or just to create it towards traditional web applications since it's just a final project and dealing with modern web applications might be left for future development.
[07:54:12] <Siente> That's my first concern to begin with.

[07:58:46] <Siente> Let's say I am testing a specific web page for SQL Injection vulnerability, to test it there are different ways of attacking i.e. you can try to send single quote ' as an input and if the response contains some kind of SQL error message or the status is 500 internal server error it means that there is a SQL Injection vulnerability right?

[08:00:34] *** Quits: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:01:49] <Siente> one of the ways testing for SQL Injection vulnerability is building http requests upon the links with query parameters I've managed to find the other way is building https requests upon html forms I have parsed.
[08:03:03] <Siente> The main problem here is if there are many parameters not just one and if there is a server side validation which I am not able to pass using black box testing methodology without knowing the system from the inside and what data is considered valid.
[08:03:58] <Siente> I need to figure out what I should be considering as vulnerability and what not and what can be tested and what not using the black box testing methodology.
[08:04:04] *** Joins: saroy (~Sandipan@43.252.250.86)
[08:05:48] <Siente> it's obvious I will start with crawling the web application, gathering all the links, parsing all the forms ( to build http requests upon them ) etc..
[08:06:27] <Siente> The main problem for me is that I have to make an automation tests towards unknown system to test it from the outside.
[08:06:38] <ajak> we've discussed this before
[08:06:45] <Siente> yes, but still it's not clear for me.
[08:07:10] <ajak> well, if you're testing a black box, you're never going to be testing a white box
[08:07:15] <Siente> we talked about using american fuzzy lop or something
[08:07:45] <Siente> ajak the goal is not testing a white box, web vulnerability scanners are DAST Tools and DAST Tools are testing black box only
[08:08:06] <ajak> yes, but you don't seem to understand that
[08:08:21] *** Quits: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:08:33] <sam_> there is no 100% guaranteed way to know if you've hit an SQL injection vulnerability; first, silent SQL injection is a thing (things look ok but it still got injected somewhere)
[08:08:42] <Siente> I understand that and that's the problem in black box testing you are just sending an input in my case http request and you receive output which in my case is http response
[08:08:56] <sam_> secondly, the error might appear not just as a 500 error, or an SQL error on the page, but possibly any sort of error (or again, nothing at all) like "invalid password"
[08:09:10] <sam_> a good heuristic would be in addition to checking for error/500, to compare with a non-SQLi string
[08:09:24] <sam_> but this is life with blackbox testing
[08:09:25] *** Joins: freep (~freepppp@62.1.174.38.dsl.dyn.forthnet.gr)
[08:09:32] <sam_> you can't be sure of various things
[08:10:03] <Siente> sam_ exactly that's why I don't know how to make an automatic tool to test a web application from the outside for vulnerabilities
[08:10:14] <Siente> If I do it manually I can understand the responses and what is going on
[08:10:32] *** Quits: jw4 (~Thunderbi@user/jw4) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:10:39] <Siente> and knowing the system will help, but you can explore it manually somehow maybe not completely.
[08:11:03] <sam_> looking at something like sqlmap may be useful, but my point is that it's going to be heuristic based. you can be more sure something went wrong if you get a 500 (although it could mean e.g. mod_security in apache caught it), and then a bit less sure but possible if you get an error string, maybe a bit less sure again but possible if the output differs from a known-good/known-bad output ...
[08:11:04] <Siente> but I don't know how to do it programmatically
[08:11:11] <sam_> but like there's no strict algorithm and that's the whole.. thing
[08:11:19] <sam_> you need just a bunch of fallbacks and heuristics
[08:12:02] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:13:17] <Siente> sam_ let's say there is a server side validation that my scanner won't be able to pass I think it's not a good idea trying to pass it using american fuzzy lop or something, but If I am not able to pass the server side validation I won't be able to test for vulnerabilities, so I am just skipping this request and not counting it as vulnerability and
[08:13:18] <Siente> going to the next endpoint?
[08:13:54] *** Joins: _mikey (~mikey@user/mikey/x-4335048)
[08:14:00] <sam_> yeah, that sounds reasonable. You can try a few easy things, if they all fail, move on. you might want to allow an aggressive option to not even bother with e.g. the comparison against a normal error page and give up early

[08:14:48] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[08:15:51] <Siente> sam_ so the things which are not clear to me is because there is no specific algorithm about that and I can't develop some kind of AI trying to understand the responses etc.. and test based on them
[08:16:12] <sam_> exactly: you come up with your own based on things you've seen in the past.
[08:16:22] <Siente> the main problem is that pen testers, QA specialists etc.. they all know the system that they are testing and most likely they have tested it manually and made an automation test upon their manual test
[08:16:32] <sam_> And, again, you can, at worst, pass a known "bad" user/pw (no injection), compare the error with when you try sqli to see if something different happened
[08:17:01] <sam_> you probably want to look at what sqlmap does
[08:17:58] <sam_> like you can't just obtain more information because you want to
[08:18:02] <sam_> you have to try specific things or not
[08:18:14] <sam_> blackbox testing by definition starts from a different set of information known
[08:19:01] <sam_> i can't give you a magic answer because there isn't one; blackbox testing relies on heuristics (which means trying things with a good chance of working and analysing their results)
[08:20:52] <Siente> sam_ so I should start with developing my crawler ( web spider ) to be able to explore web applications and then I should start reading a lot about the different type of vulnerabilities, testing manually etc.. analyzing responses etc.. and based on that then I can build a logic based on heuristics as you said and do it automatically
[08:20:52] <Siente> programmatically
[08:21:02] <sam_> that sounds good

[08:33:48] <sam_> if you do, you may have to then cite them in your university work
[08:33:53] <sam_> and make sure it doesn't taint you too much
[08:34:00] <sam_> I would suggest looking at them later
[08:34:07] <sam_> possibly once you've already done a fair bit of work
[08:35:13] <Siente> I have no issues to cite them, because If I didn't want to make a decent thesis I wouldn't be here asking for your guidance, tips, help, advices etc..

[08:38:22] <Siente> sam_ I think that's how I will go, looking at them later, first I will focus on learning a lot about the different type of vulnerabilities using tools like Damn Vulnerable Web Application: DVWA to explore them completely and then based on my experience I will try to develop automatic tests
[08:39:32] <Siente> thank you guys, I have messed up completely, because of this final project.
[08:40:38] <Siente> sam_ I have no idea how much time I would need to develop such a tool

[08:41:06] <Siente> sam_ exploring a web application is not an easy task as well, and I first need to explore it in order to be able to test it again different type of vulnerabilities
[08:41:34] <Siente> sam_ of course I will build some web apps for test purposes in my university work
[08:41:53] <Siente> and I will be testing web applications developed by me

[08:49:28] <sam_> no problem :)
[08:49:45] <sam_> also, I thin kit's okay to not develop something as sophisticated something which has existed for many years & had many contributions
[08:49:49] <sam_> think of the number of manhours put into it
[08:49:51] <Siente> the main problem here is that I am not sure If I will manage to do it
[08:50:29] <Siente> sam_ exactly
[08:51:02] <Siente> sam_ it is hard to develop such a DAST Tool
[08:51:45] <Siente> sam_ and requires a lot of time
[08:52:46] <sam_> I've got to be honest, I am wondering the same (if it'd be better to pick a project with smaller scope) or similar
[08:53:11] <Siente> sam_ for your thesis?

[17:49:33] <B4ckBOne> You can find the rulesets here: https://www.snort.org/downloads
[17:49:46] <B4ckBOne> They implement well with pfSense or other Firewall distributions like OPNSense
[17:50:10] <B4ckBOne> Do you have a hardware firewall?

[23:09:24] <Mathisen> well good luck with that.. both got pros and cons.. open source = more people can find problems BUT things get fixed fast also.. closed source = not that many that finds problems but usaly takes longer to fix issues. ofc it all depends on the software but this is usaly the case

[23:14:29] <Mathisen> indeed

[23:15:31] <Mathisen> not always the case. but i get your point. just look at bitlocker for windows
[23:16:33] <eoli3n> is that used for the main reason that its embeeded to the OS ? (i don't know well that tool, we use it at work, but Windows is not my part)
