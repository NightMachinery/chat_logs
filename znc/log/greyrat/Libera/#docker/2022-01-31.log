[14:08:14] <molt> hey friends. I'm pretty new to Docker and have a question that should be easy for seasoned folks. So, I am experimenting with something called Metabase and installed it as a Docker container as per the instructions on their site: https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/running-metabase-on-docker.html
[14:09:09] <molt> I wanted to follow the instructions in the "Mounting a mapped file storage volume" section, but got an error when trying to stand up the container.
[14:09:32] <molt> Seems like the DB file isn't created so that causes the freakout.
[14:09:54] <molt> So I opted for the simpler:
[14:10:10] <molt> docker run -d -p 3000:3000 
[14:10:10] <molt> -v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data 
[14:10:10] <molt> --name metabase metabase/metabase

[14:10:20] *** Quits: moldorcoder7 (~moldorcod@37.120.143.28) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:10:42] <molt> (removing the -e switch mapping the database file
[14:11:12] <molt> I was thinking "once I stand it up I can then map the database file after it is created"
[14:11:26] <molt> issue is I have not idea how to do that :P lol
[14:11:38] <molt> does this make sense? can anyone explain / help?
[14:12:48] <gordonjcp> molt: if you let it create the ~/metabase directory itself it'll be owned by root which might not be what you want
[14:13:30] <gordonjcp> molt: what exactly was the error you saw?
[14:14:13] <molt> exit code 1
[14:14:17] <gordonjcp> molt: also if you miss off the -e line then metabase has no idea where the file should go
[14:14:34] <gordonjcp> molt: so really what you need to do is pastebin the whole error, verbatim
[14:14:46] <gordonjcp> or, if you don't like pastebin, some other text pasting site
[14:14:50] *** Joins: Feuermagier (~Feuermagi@user/feuermagier)
[14:15:02] <gordonjcp> molt: do you understand what each of the lines of that command mean?
[14:15:19] <molt> gordonjcp: i can do that. just need a min to tear down the container, retrace my steps and then pastebin the messages/errors
[14:15:35] <molt> gordonjcp: yes, I do understand them
[14:15:50] <gordonjcp> okay
[14:16:13] <gordonjcp> so then you need to create the volume in the container, and then tell metabase where that is
[14:16:32] <molt> gordonjcp: docker run -d -p 3000:3000 = run docker (but I forget what -d is -- detached?) and map the host port 3000 to the container port 3000
[14:16:39] <gordonjcp> yup
[14:16:42] <gordonjcp> -d is detach
[14:16:51] <gordonjcp> it's probably better to leave -d off so you can actually see it running
[14:16:55] <molt> gordonjcp: aha.. detach. what does that mean exactly though?
[14:17:00] <molt> aha
[14:17:10] <gordonjcp> molt: it'll disconnect from the terminal once it starts up
[14:17:20] <gordonjcp> you won't see messages from the container, it'll only go to the logs
[14:17:20] <molt> gordonjcp: understood
[14:17:45] <gordonjcp> I tend to leave -d off until I'm ready to pull the trigger on it live
[14:18:32] <molt> gordonjcp: -v ~/metabase-dataa:/metabase-data (create a mapped volume. home folder/metabase-data on the host --to-- /metabase-data in the container)
[14:19:25] <molt> gordonjcp: --name metabase metabase/metabase (name the container "metabase" and pull the image from docker --> metabase/metabase)
[14:19:30] <gordonjcp> right
[14:19:32] <gordonjcp> but you missed a bit
[14:19:47] <molt> huh? what did I miss?
[14:19:56] <gordonjcp> -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
[14:21:31] <molt> yes, Like I said, when I tried that it gave me the error "exit code 1". and after investigating it seemed like when you first run the container that file doesn't exist because you haven't set anything up yet, so Docker gets mad that you are trying to map to a file that doesn't exist in the container. So I dropped that line opting to add it after I got things running
[14:21:42] <molt> lemme give that line a shot (translating it)
[14:21:58] <molt> BTW: I appreciate you. This is all new to me and I am trying my best to understand
[14:22:41] <gordonjcp> okay
[14:22:46] <gordonjcp> but you need to know what the error actually is
[14:22:59] <gordonjcp> saying "exit code 1" is like saying "my car has a warning light on"
[14:23:14] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[14:23:17] <gordonjcp> that's a shame and I feel sorry for you, but it doesn't actually tell anyone how to help you
[14:23:22] <gordonjcp> :-D
[14:23:49] <gordonjcp> what the -e does is sets an environment variable, which in this case tells it to actually put the database file in the volume
[14:24:08] <molt> -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \ (a switch for this container -- as per Metabase. Says "The database file will be put in the directory /metabase-data and the file will be called metabase.db" then the "\" just says keep running this command with the stuff on the next line)
[14:24:28] <gordonjcp> yup
[14:24:38] <gordonjcp> did you actually create ~/metabase-data ?
[14:25:10] <molt> ok. Glad I got that all right. Yes I did. I actually changed the locations in my specific instance, but yes. I did it all correct
[14:26:03] <molt> ok... so "exit code 1" is not a specific thing. Thanks. I didn't know that
[14:26:06] <gordonjcp> okay, so can you paste *verbatim* the command you started it with?
[14:26:26] <gordonjcp> yeah "exit code 1" just means "it exited because something happened" but doesn't actually explain what happened
[14:26:32] <gordonjcp> molt: probably you have a path wrong
[14:26:40] <molt> sure. I originally didn't because that shows some infrastructure info, but lemme go ahead. one sec
[14:26:46] <molt> i'll drop it in pastebin
[14:27:10] <gordonjcp> feel free to PM me it, if you don't want to make it public, I won't tell anyone ;-)
[14:27:15] <molt> gimme a sec. first I need to VPN to the network to talk to the machine where this is happening.
[14:27:23] <molt> hehehe

[17:03:34] <vaio> damn, okay
[17:03:35] <tabakhase> vaio the only way to safely provide docker to users, is by giving them there own kernels, so VMs - if you need more than a handfull, maybe have a look at docker-machine (gitlabs fork for up2date)
[17:04:49] <tabakhase> if "safe" isnt an issue, but youd still like a bit of issolation, dind (docker-in-docker) may also be a case  ((will stop me from accidentially overwriting "your" olume named "test", but one can still --pid host and exploit himself to the top :P
[17:05:33] <vaio> uhoh, okay, interesting
[17:05:55] <tabakhase> note with that that dind isnt rly "production" quallity, - still works just fine for dev/lab/ci and such tho^^

[17:24:13] <Shariff> Hi there.. 
[17:25:28] <Shariff> What is the syntax for a docker create volume for a bind mount? Online I come across a lot of examples but all used when defining a container.. I want a few containers to share that 1 mount point
[17:25:54] <tabakhase> Shariff its always when defining a container
[17:26:10] <tabakhase> to use the same on two "literally just do that" ;-)
[17:26:55] <Shariff> Is that new? A while back I created them, then in a compose file I declared them external.. and could point a to location... also I'm trying to do it in portainer.. 
[17:28:00] *** Joins: itsalexjones (~itsalexjo@82.4.99.241)
[17:29:38] <tabakhase> Shariff no? and uh? -- when you say bindmount, there sint even a "volume" involved that would need to be created - its legit just the path   ((defining a path for a volume is rather new/special, they usually live in /var/lib/docker and stay there...)  --- then external: you mostly see with networks, volumes(espc. when they are bindmounts) shouldnt need --- lastly didnt work? should.. compose 
[17:29:38] <tabakhase> prepends the name of things with projectname, make sure to explicitly specify a name: when linking with external things
[17:31:31] <Shariff> ok.. then I'm a bit at a loss.. if I want to create a bind mount to let/s say /mnt/photos.. what should I be looking for (so I can find the syntax)? :)

[17:53:13] <tabakhase> Shariff im lost too :P - its just /mnt/photos:/container/path either in a volumes: block (compose) or as -v (docker-cli) - there isnt rly much more to it :)
[17:54:15] <tabakhase> and you can use that in 100containers at the same time if you wanted, nothing stopping ya -- maybe just actually try it out, youre welcome to then throw an error in here if you find one
[17:54:36] <Shariff> I'm sorry for being so unclear.. I remember making volumes.. so I guess that is messing me up :) Am I perhaps mistaking named volumes with a specific location on disk?
[17:55:22] <Shariff> Because I remember also adding a volumes section at the top of the compose file, where I said: photos_data: external: true ... and use photos_data in the services? Does that make more sense with a named volume?
[17:55:51] <tabakhase> possible, see my message from timestamp 14:59:37
[17:55:53] <Shariff> and photos_data would then point to /mnt/photos
[17:56:55] <tabakhase> bindmounts and volumes are different - both share the "volume:" and "-v" params --- docker basically checks "does the name start with a "/"
[17:56:59] <Shariff> Yes, I read that.. but I'm trying to do 2 things now.. understand how to define things so I can work with that specific location in different services in my compose file and understand why I did things differently :)

[17:58:31] <Shariff> I remember making "something" outside of the compose file, where I refered to that "something" in the volumes section with the addition "external: true" .. and use the named "something" in the services->volume section
[17:58:37] <tabakhase> "bind mounts" and "volumes" also act a little different, namely, "volumes" when created get the files that were IN the container moved into the new volume - where as "bindmounts" completly throw away what the container had and only your host-folder matters
[17:59:35] *** Joins: FreEm1nD (~FreEm1nD@mail.guarapari.store)
[17:59:51] <tabakhase> bind-mount is generally more a "ship this in" (like your codebase, or your movie libary) -- while volumes is more "store that" (to carry from container to container generation on updates)
[18:03:55] <Shariff> Ah.. ok.. so can I name those bind mounts? or just add /mnt/photos:/photos to every service-> volume section?
[18:04:39] <tabakhase> you add it everywhere yep
[18:04:49] <Shariff> Thanks for the help and patience! :D

The issue is, I don't know what I need yet... I'm still troubleshooting. I have this right now: command: /bin/bash -c "/sky/tools/wait-for-it.sh postgres:5432 -- sleep 15 && python3 -m app.web" ... that gives me 15 seconds to troubleshoot before the 
[23:13:53] <foo> container dies because app.web dies. Any other workarounds here? 
[23:14:44] <dodo> while true; do webapp; sleep 1; done
[23:15:25] <dodo> or, you know, fix the app ;)
[23:16:13] <DoofusCanadensis> sounds like that's what they're trying to do... debug the app in order to fix it
[23:16:19] <foo> dodo: that's the thing, I can't fix the app if it keeps dying within docker container. The issue is in the container... a postgres driver or something for sqlalchemy 
[23:16:22] <foo> thank you DoofusCanadensis, yes.
[23:16:51] <dodo> i see. don't you get logs, a traceback?
[23:17:01] <foo> dodo: yes... but I still need to go back into the container to troubleshoot with that. 
[23:17:51] <DoofusCanadensis> while true; python3 -m app.web; sleep 1; done should keep the container up
[23:18:03] <DoofusCanadensis> but then... app.web is a python3 module?
[23:18:23] <foo> dodo: yes
[23:18:24] <DoofusCanadensis> what's happening on that line should end up in the logs
[23:18:26] <foo> err, DoofusCanadensis ^
[23:18:35] <foo> DoofusCanadensis: yes, it's in the logs
[23:18:53] <DoofusCanadensis> okay, I don't know about writing python modules. good luck with that
[23:18:53] <foo> I need to get into the container to apt-get something... see if it fixes it. If yes, I update my docker file and rebuild container
[23:18:58] <foo> If there's another process here I'm open to it
[23:19:10] <dodo> foo: don't you have a CI?
[23:19:24] <DoofusCanadensis> assume that this is pre-ci
[23:19:31] <DoofusCanadensis> dev is trying to figure out their own container 
[23:20:54] <foo> DoofusCanadensis is correct, once again.
[23:21:10] <dodo> have you shared your traceback somewhere?
[23:21:55] <foo> dodo: I genuinely appreciate your willingness to help, but it's possible I'm not being understood. I think I know how to resolve this, I simply need my container to stay up long enough to resolve it so I can be certain.
[23:22:06] <foo> I think I'm set, thanks
