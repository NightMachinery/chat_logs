[01:48:48] <gamara> hey this is probably a really dumb question, I am a complete noob when it comes to sessions. My php client keeps regenerating the UUID that I store in my session token as the 'id' and I dont know why I am using symfony2
[01:48:50] <gamara> https://pastebin.com/JwDHYmep
[01:49:35] <gamara> basically i when I interact with my react component it just creates an entirely new UUID which is breaking my server
[01:50:32] <Albright> gamara: This looks like Symfony-specific code so you might have better luck asking in a Symfony channel.
[01:51:12] <Albright> gamara: But as just a guess, I notice you call $session->start(); *after* checking to see if 'id' is there, which feels backwards.
[01:53:14] <gamara> ok I will try moving $session->start() to before the if statement
[01:53:26] <gamara> thanks so much I didnt know they had their own channel

[02:17:54] <dag> gamara: i suggest learning how sessions work
[02:17:59] <gamara> that is a good idea
[02:18:09] <celphi> Can someoe advice the rules to follow for image upload
[02:18:17] <celphi> i remember there was a website for it
[02:18:20] <dag> your client is supposed to include the session cookie in its requests but is probably not doing so
[02:18:24] <celphi> !fileupload
[02:18:36] <celphi> !image_upload
[02:18:48] <celphi> __adrian: do ou remember
[02:20:31] <dag> gamara: the uuid is not sent by client. it exists only serverside
[02:22:29] <dag> to make a long story short: a session is a list of related http requests. it is solved by giving the client a cookie which acts as a password so that server knows it's you again. usually there is some persistent data on the serverside which is associated with the session.
[02:25:32] *** Quits: sumthing1980 (~sumthing1@94.54.64.154) (Quit: Leaving)

[02:45:01] <celphi> Albright:
[02:45:28] <Blondie101010> celphi:  the main problem with image uploads is when you try to convert them
[02:45:51] <celphi> yeah but there are other exploits
[02:46:06] <celphi> i was hoping someoe already built a library for it
[02:46:32] <Blondie101010> do you already have a solution for the main problem I just mentioned?
[02:46:43] <celphi> to upload without converting?
[02:46:44] <Blondie101010> do you resize/convert the images?
[02:46:57] <celphi> with gd library?
[02:47:04] <Blondie101010> any library
[02:47:34] <celphi> no,. i wanted to see if there was all in one library that handled it all without having to cherry pick pieces together
[02:47:50] <Blondie101010> "all" is too wide
[02:48:11] <celphi> adrian posted a link about 3 months ago of the 8 things
[02:48:31] <celphi> i just cant find it
[02:48:38] <celphi> it's a bot command
[02:50:45] <Albright> Are you already working with a framework of some sort?
[02:51:55] <Blondie101010> !+uploads are hard
[02:51:55] <php-bot> there are a lot of very important details to consider before you do file uploads. https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/file-upload-checklist/
[02:53:08] <Albright> Oh, nice.
[02:53:16] <Albright> Is there a list of bot commands somewhere?
[02:53:58] <gamara> yeah daq the session is attached to an id and delivered as headers in the http request
[02:53:59] <gamara> right
[02:54:09] <gamara> I have done jwt authentication before
[02:54:11] <Albright> Or maybe if it can't find a topic it could suggest other topics based on Levenshtein distance
[02:54:39] <gamara> I thought you could set information on the session and access it from calls to the server
[02:55:17] <gamara> Like for example I want an ID to represent a player on my server so I can retrieve the information they need
[02:55:37] <Albright> Wait, are we talking about client-server integration?
[02:56:04] <gamara> My problem is I have a websocket server that connects players together
[02:56:09] <Albright> Like are you setting data on the client side and then trying to read it on the server?
[02:56:15] <gamara> I want to pass a playerId to that websocket server
[02:56:19] <gamara> through a session variable
[02:57:07] <Albright> Hmm, I bet sessions are weird with websockets since they don't go through the usual web request process.
[02:57:09] <gamara> I have an index.php that the user accesses in his browser, that creates a session on hte server side
[02:57:32] <gamara> then I access that session in the websocket server through a memcached storage
[02:57:45] <gamara> The problem is it changes the UUID everytime it makes a request
[02:57:47] *** Joins: Alex8532 (~Alex8532@user/alex8532)
[02:58:02] <gamara> which basically makes the session pointless to use
[02:58:42] <Albright> Okay, so the index.php page at least does the normal web request cycle, right?
[02:58:50] <Albright> *lifecycle
[02:59:06] <celphi> thank you Blondie101010 that was it
[02:59:22] <Blondie101010> np
[02:59:43] <Albright> That means with the page response it's going to send a cookie to the client.
[03:00:00] <gamara> yes
[03:00:01] <Albright> Now is the client going to send that cookie when it opens a websocket connection?
[03:00:04] <gamara> the client has a cookie
[03:00:10] <gamara> yes
[03:00:11] <Albright> I don't know the answer to that. Websockets are weird.
[03:00:19] <Albright> Are you sure?
[03:00:34] <gamara> http://socketo.me/docs/sessions
[03:00:36] <Albright> Can you dump $_COOKIE and see it?
[03:00:40] <gamara> this is the guide I was following
[03:01:31] <gamara> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32357979/get-session-data-using-ratchet-websocket-and-symfony
[03:01:33] <gamara> or rather this
[03:01:55] <gamara> I guess I could try
[03:03:31] *** Joins: stkrdknmibalz (~test@rrcs-75-87-43-228.sw.biz.rr.com)
[03:04:01] <gamara> I think the session is shared between the websocket server and the php-fpm instance
[03:05:35] <gamara> through memcached
[03:05:46] <Blondie101010> do you understand that the websocket connection is persistent, way beyond the first page load?
[03:05:59] <Blondie101010> the page load is not WSS
[03:07:45] <gamara> yes
[03:07:48] <gamara> I understand that
[03:07:53] <gamara> that is why I have a playerId
[03:08:07] <gamara> which I am storing in a session
[03:08:14] <gamara> so I can keep track if a person disconnects
[03:08:18] <gamara> and allow them to rejoin
[03:08:56] <gamara> my problem is that everytime the user interacts with the page it regenerates a new UUID for the session
[03:09:23] <Blondie101010> how are you using a session inside a WS connection?
[03:09:37] <Blondie101010> that really sounds like you don't understand what you're trying to do
[03:09:49] <gamara> I am using the session to store a playerID
[03:10:01] <Blondie101010> the WS connection is persistent
[03:10:07] <gamara> I understand that
[03:10:15] <Blondie101010> where is the session used?
[03:10:18] <gamara> but the connection between client and websocket serveris not
[03:10:34] <gamara> Dont session cookies exist during the lifetime of the browser session
[03:10:44] <gamara> so if the user refreshes the page
[03:10:51] <gamara> they keep the same userId
[03:10:56] <Blondie101010> yes ok
[03:11:01] <gamara> That is what I am trying to do
[03:11:19] <gamara> rather than store the id in local storage
[03:11:26] <gamara> which is not as secure
[03:11:27] <gamara> from what I read
[03:11:53] <Blondie101010> either way it's sent by the front-end (which is not under your control)
[03:12:16] <gamara> yeah I know but the session ID relates to data you have stored about the user
[03:12:18] <gamara> right?
[03:12:38] <gamara> so when your server recieves the request it sees the session ID and goes oh this relates to this data
[03:12:48] <gamara> or they are authenticated
[03:13:02] <Blondie101010> and how do you pass that information to the WS server?
[03:13:09] <gamara> Through memcache
[03:13:23] <gamara> so the websocket server recieves the session ID in the header of the request
[03:13:33] <gamara> then it accesses memcached to get the data associated with it
[03:13:35] <Blondie101010> how does it know what "session" it is?
[03:13:48] <Blondie101010> a GET parameter?
[03:14:08] <gamara> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32357979/get-session-data-using-ratchet-websocket-and-symfony
[03:14:17] <gamara> its using a memcached storage
[03:14:52] <gamara> https://pastebin.com/JwDHYmep
[03:14:59] <gamara> and this is my index.php
[03:15:14] <gamara> its using symfony2 sessions
[03:15:30] <gamara> http://socketo.me/docs/sessions
[03:15:42] <gamara> Like its working its passing the uuid that I set as ID
[03:15:51] <gamara> but everytime I send a request its a new UUID
[03:15:58] <gamara> even when the cookie SSID doesnt change
[03:16:33] <gamara> this breaks my server because a websocket clientInterface shouldnt be able to change unique ID
[03:18:23] <gamara> thanks for helping me with this btw blondie I really appreciate it
[03:18:58] <dag> the session must be started before accessing session data
[03:19:29] <gamara> yeah that is the case
[03:19:41] <dag> im not familiar with websockets but looks like it's a php userland tcp server? using php sessions is nonsense in this case.
[03:19:41] <gamara> as soon as the page loads
[03:19:52] <gamara> a session is created the socket server hasn't connected
[03:20:23] <gamara> so you are saying I should just store the userID in local storage
[03:20:27] <gamara> and give up?
[03:20:52] <gamara> ok weird
[03:20:56] <dag> no
[03:20:57] <gamara> the cookie gives me this info
[03:20:57] <__adrian> gamara: what info do you need to share, here?
[03:20:58] <gamara>  Array ( [PHPSESSID] => f20472155d6297cfe55d8caa560d12e1 ) 1
[03:21:01] <Blondie101010> gamara:  you'll need to at least share session information between the HTTP and WS servers
[03:21:13] <gamara> I am just trying to share a UUID
[03:21:17] <gamara> to identify the client
[03:21:21] <gamara> incase they connect
[03:21:22] <Blondie101010> so just pass it
[03:21:33] <__adrian> give the uuid to the client. the client can send it when they connect to the WS
[03:21:34] <gamara> yeah I was doing that but I thought I would use sessions
[03:21:48] <gamara> since its better than using local storage
[03:22:04] <__adrian> there's no reason to choose between local storage and sessions here
[03:22:12] <__adrian> neither are for what you're doing
[03:22:43] <gamara> How do I keep random people from connecting to my websocket server then
[03:22:46] <__adrian> you just need to tell the ws server "who this is," right?
[03:23:11] <gamara> I also want to prevent unauthorized access
[03:23:39] <__adrian> if some random person sends you a uuid, it's extremely unlikely they'll guess one that exists
[03:23:50] <__adrian> and you can hmac it if you want
[03:24:31] <__adrian> (if the uuid itself is not secret)
[03:24:41] <gamara> what do you mean hmac?
[03:25:08] <__adrian> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC
[03:25:45] <__adrian> e.g., a jwt
[03:25:51] <gamara> oh
[03:26:36] <gamara> yeah JWT would be easier lol

[03:27:14] <gamara> and thanks everyone for your help

[06:02:24] <__adrian> recommend reading that man page carefully, btw. looking at how you're trying to use those $matches, i think you'd probably want to set different $flags
[06:02:36] <jargon> I still don't comperehend the structure of $matches
[06:03:11] <__adrian> it's explained well on the man page. i couldn't really do better.
[06:03:51] <__adrian> note PREG_PATTERN_ORDER is the default.
[06:03:51] <jargon> I want to produce an array of: array( $index => array( 'stat' => $foo, 'value' => $bar ));
[06:04:45] <jargon> or better yet an array of: array( $stat => $value );
[06:05:00] <__adrian> read about $flags
[06:05:08] <__adrian> it describes the structures you can choose
[06:07:45] <jargon> how do I proplerly use $matches['stat'] and $matches['value'] ?
[06:09:29] <__adrian> you can't do that until you learn about the structure. (i'm not going to write code for you; we don't do that here.) once you've done that, there's nothing special about accessing it: it's just an array.
[06:10:32] <__adrian> ($matches['stat'] and $matches['value'] don't exist - that's why you need to read + inspect so you can understand the array's structure)
[06:17:42] <jargon> There isn't 'stat' or 'value' in it at all, which isn't very helpful.
[06:18:16] <__adrian> don't forget to read about $flags. it describes the structures you can choose.
[06:18:30] <jargon> It's almost like PHP is retroevolving on a daily basis.
[06:18:46] <__adrian> if you're frustrated, take a break
[06:18:56] <__adrian> but this is something that hasn't changed in years and years
[06:27:02] <jargon> https://www.regular-expressions.info/named.html
[06:27:32] <__adrian> your regex is fine
[06:27:54] <__adrian> the thing you're not understanding is the structure of $matches
[06:33:44] <jargon> https://regex101.com/r/ZQzCg6/1/ No it was not, this is it how it originally was.
[06:34:30] <jargon> Notice this one is multi-capture.
[06:39:15] <jargon> I should be able to simply use if(preg_match_all(fubar),$matches) { foooo $matches['stat'] foobororor $matches['value'] }
[06:39:55] <jargon> As silly as my pseudocode makes me look.
[06:41:07] <jargon> Regex in PHP has never been this difficult for me before.
[06:41:15] <__adrian> no, you should not be able to so that. that's not how the function works. you need to read about/inspect the structure of the $matches array, and about how you can use $flags to decide the structure you want to use.
[06:41:25] <__adrian> your problem is not the regex.
[06:41:43] <jargon> Then what is the point of named capture groups?
[06:42:07] <__adrian> again, your problem is not the regex. there's nothing wrong with your named capture groups.
[06:42:13] <jargon> I've used named groups in the past just fine and dandy.
[06:42:42] <__adrian> please take some time to actually read the manual and inspect the $matches in your code. you won't get anywhere otherwise.
[06:43:28] <jargon> I've been reading the manual all night, on various websites and looked at various tutorials.
[06:44:45] <jargon> My methods worked in the past, I have no clue what it isn't cooperating.
[06:45:09] <jargon> For all I know someone is pranking me using an apache mod.'
[06:46:03] <jargon> var dump is impossible to read.

[11:09:43] <AllenJB> pcfreak30: Without seeing the code you're attempting to port / knowing what you're trying to do it's hard to make specific recommendations. In PHP, strings are byte arrays. You can use numeric indexes to address specific bytes: https://3v4l.org/2tUW7

[11:12:53] <pcfreak30> Honestly im not sure. Im dealing with some api communication that deals with cryptography. Im porting a SDk to php so im trying to have to find equiv's on things
[11:14:20] <pcfreak30> one example is a function  that uses Uint8Array(matches.map((byte) => parseInt(byte, 16)));
[11:14:47] <pcfreak30> another uint8ArrayToStringUtf8 Buffer.from(array).toString("utf-8");
[11:15:12] <AllenJB> If it's standard crypto algorithms you need to work with, there's likely built-in methods for handling them - see the openssl and sodium extensions. You should avoid trying to write your own cryptographic algorithms code
[11:15:48] <pcfreak30> well im not using the crypto functions yet, but ive found libsodium has the needed support

[11:17:13] <Naktibalda> porting is dangerous too
[11:18:07] <pcfreak30> im not writing crypto code.  its more of a lot of data format conversions. dealing with binary, base32 and base64.
[11:18:19] <TinoDidriksen> parseInt(byte, 16) is just https://php.net/hexdec, so that whole mapping is just decoding a hex string.
[11:18:31] <pcfreak30> and specific requirements to be compatible with existing code
[11:18:39] <pcfreak30> https://github.com/beatgammit/base64-js/blob/master/index.js
[11:18:57] <pcfreak30> toByteArray/fromByteArray is used there
[11:19:32] <AllenJB> Rather than attempting a "line by line" port, consider what the entire code (function) is doing. PHP has lots of built-in functions for things.
[11:20:10] <AllenJB> In this case, see base64_encode() / base64_decode()
[11:21:16] <pcfreak30> AllenJB: i know the code base pretty decent, but im roughly replicating the api structure as well, and some parts  i will are over my head, but those have 3rd party libraries to use or i can replicate the logic fairly easily
[11:21:48] <pcfreak30> yes i know about base64_encode. i had to get a base32 class and extract its logic
[11:21:58] <pcfreak30> both are used
[11:22:37] <pcfreak30> the byte array is used like this as an ex:  const publicKeyBytes = toByteArray(publicKey);
[11:23:04] <pcfreak30> im using bin2hex to make a hex string version
[11:23:13] <Naktibalda> it is created like that, you don't shop how it is used
[11:23:25] <AllenJB> It's also worth searching packagist for existing implementations - https://packagist.org/?query=base32

[11:28:08] <pcfreak30> translate
[11:28:52] <Naktibalda> you don't need that conversion at all, you can change validation to if (strlen($publicKey) !== xxx) throw new InvalidArgumentException);
[11:29:51] <pcfreak30> yes to be clear the validateUint8ArrayLen im skipping. a few of those functions im using that are more speciality
[11:30:35] <pcfreak30> but im not doing a 1:1 transaction, but following what is made so i can make something that models the original
[11:31:34] <Naktibalda> you should port tests
[11:31:44] <pcfreak30> lol
[11:32:22] <pcfreak30> I tend to cowboy code due to how I work before I do any tests. doing TDD would slow me down tremendously
[11:32:40] <pcfreak30> i dont think that way easily
[11:32:57] <Naktibalda> without tests you can't prove that the system behaves in the same way.
[11:33:13] <pcfreak30> yes i know, but i can atleast see if it even runs at all
[11:33:27] <pcfreak30> with  simple test scripts
[11:33:35] <pcfreak30> one step at a time
[11:33:53] <pcfreak30> so my biggist concern now is toByteArray, and if bin2hex is enough for toHexString. or if pack/unpack, which i have never understood, is needed
[11:33:57] <Naktibalda> here, it would be the best to write a few high level tests for external interface of the code, to test important behaviours,
[11:34:44] <Naktibalda> first in javascript, then convert those tests to PHP. all you need is a proof that given the same inputs you get the same outputs. the code inside can be completely different
[11:35:27] <pcfreak30> Yes I know that but the data conversions are not something in extremely strong in. A lot of the code is different, but its following the same logic flow
[11:35:47] <pcfreak30> and basically all of https://github.com/SkynetLabs/skynet-js/blob/89fcdfc3dbe66ff27ef0f14bc8751ee2ec78fa49/src/utils/encoding.ts is what im trying to find parallels for
[11:36:02] <pcfreak30> the base 64/32 i already have
[11:36:03] <Naktibalda> pcfreak30: toByteArray is completely redundant in PHP, just use strings. and look at that packagist link, top result is a library for base16, base32 and base64 encodings
[11:36:47] <pcfreak30> kk, ive skipped that as i read php stores as byte arrays already?
[11:37:03] <Naktibalda> it behaves as byte array
[11:37:37] <pcfreak30> using hex2bin for https://github.com/SkynetLabs/skynet-js/blob/89fcdfc3dbe66ff27ef0f14bc8751ee2ec78fa49/src/registry.ts#L533. is that accurate?
[11:38:57] <pcfreak30> encodeUtf8String, encodeBigintAsUint64, encodePrefixedBytes are the other things im unsure about as well
[11:40:17] <Naktibalda> that's internals, used by that crypto library, if you found a suitable Sodium function, look what input it takes. that's what you need

[11:40:49] <pcfreak30> not all of it
[11:41:12] <pcfreak30> some of the crypto is unique to the system, the rest are standardized algorithms.
[11:41:41] <pcfreak30> so translating that is about the data type conversions with php being looser
[11:42:43] <pcfreak30> basically Uint64 and Uint8
[11:43:41] <pcfreak30> encodeUtf8String is utf to uint8, so that may be redundant?

[11:50:17] <pcfreak30> "see, all these conversions are unnecessary" i understand but its why im asking. I dont deal with these data types much so I dont know how php does it vs strictly tped languages
[11:50:56] <pcfreak30> and thats the function for black2b
[11:51:00] <Naktibalda> I think that passing result of implode('', $args) to generichash is equivalent to calling update in a loop
[11:51:09] <Hash> Hey
[11:51:11] <Hash> Oh
[11:52:12] <pcfreak30> Thanks. i need to get to sleep, but yes, these language differences are the current road block as im not an expert here. Will see how far I get tomorrow. Thanks :)

[16:01:33] <freeman_h> Hi all I ma making a post request locally from one project to another. The json I am posting it big, in raw array format it is 25k. The issue is that the data is not getting sent. If I test it just sending a test data like "foo" it works. I have increase the post max size in php init to 1G but still nothing I was wondering what other tweeks I need to make? thank you
[16:04:16] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[16:06:10] <AllenJB> Does the receiving server PHP code think it receives a request at all? If so, is the received data completely missing, or cut off at some point (number of characters)?
[16:07:45] <AllenJB> As we can't see any of the code: Are you definitely sending the data as POST? If you're sending it in query parameters (GET), (even on a POST type request) there's a maximum length for URLs
[16:08:28] <freeman_h> AllenJB: the data does not even get sent to the other project, it is not hitting my break point
[16:09:13] <AllenJB> Without seeing your code and where you break point is in that code, that doesn't tell me anything
[16:09:36] <freeman_h> just doing a post request using curl
[16:09:39] <Naktibalda> it means that there is a problem with your code
[16:09:53] <freeman_h> works for all other request
[16:10:00] <freeman_h> same code using on all 13 apis
[16:10:19] <freeman_h> just that this is the first time posting a large amoutn of data from A to B
[16:11:27] <biberu> 25kB is hardly a large amount
[16:11:41] <freeman_h> its not 25k
[16:11:48] <freeman_h> not sure how much in kb the data is
[16:12:44] <Naktibalda> var_dump($json); or var_dump(strlen($json)); would tell you
[16:16:09] <freeman_h> string(2498452)
[16:16:54] <Naktibalda> does your PHP code end successfuly or with error?
[16:17:19] <freeman_h> Naktibalda: no error
[16:18:29] <Naktibalda> if it doesn't reach your breakpoint, it is up to you to step through the code and see what it does.

[16:24:13] <biberu> freeman_h: what do you have in front of php? apache? nginx? anything else? did you check if each step allows the post size?

[16:26:34] <freeman_h> previous was on 1G
[16:27:17] <Naktibalda> you don't have to go over 3M, the default value is 8M so it should be fine.

[18:56:39] <omegatron> ah too bad.. assigning a function to a generic object doesn't work at all, huh?   like in   $obj = new stdclass () ; $obj->Print = function ( $value ) { print_r ( $value ) ) ;  $obj->Print ( 'abc' ) ;  -->  'Call to undefined method stdClass::Print() '
[18:57:12] <Naktibalda> omegatron: properties and methods are separate, so you can't call it like that
[18:57:22] <__adrian> you can do that, but that doesn't make it a method. it's a property that holds a function
[18:57:24] <omegatron> would have to defne a 'real' class or use it with call_user_func() I guess
[18:57:44] <Naktibalda> try  {$obj->Print}('abc');
[18:57:51] <omegatron> yeah, I don't expect it to be a method, just a function I call later, which is stored in a generic object
[18:58:03] <__adrian> ^ that's totally fine
[18:58:10] <__adrian> though there's absolutely no reason to not use a "real" class
[18:58:11] <omegatron> hmm, I could live with the {} syntax .. =D

[18:58:53] <omegatron> argh.. you know what I mean
[18:59:02] <__adrian> it's () not {} though
[18:59:14] * omegatron needs more alcohol ...
[19:00:44] <Naktibalda> omegatron: it would probably be better to simply extend the base class and override Print method.
[19:01:39] <Naktibalda> or implement interface
[19:03:02] <omegatron> all good - i'm not new to PHP .. just didn't try that thingie ever before
[19:04:55] <omegatron> I thought "since it's actually a string and used with () php evaluates it to a string, then checks if there is a function and calls that function ..  but it seems, interpreting that notation as a class method has higher priority
[19:05:09] <Naktibalda> you could even use anonymous class in recent versions of PHP
[19:05:16] <omegatron> (a string or an anonymous function)
[19:08:09] <Naktibalda> $obj = new class { function Print($value) { print_r($value); } }

[19:48:08] <freeman_h> hi guys when using doctrine createQueryBuilder is forces you to use an alias. this alias is then included as a prefix in the result as part of the key e.g. Id will be u_Id any ideas how to prevent this?
[19:48:48] <kittonian> can anyone help with configuring apache's conf running in one docker container to proxy to another docker container where php-fpm is running on port 9000? I've tried a bunch of stuff and can't seem to get it to work. I can get everything working just fine if I'm not using php-fpm but I'd really like to do this the correct way.

[19:53:05] <Blondie101010> kittonian:  use the same volume on both containers

[19:54:09] <kittonian> Blondie101010, I'm not sure what you mean. these are two separate docker containers that I need to keep separated for security, etc. reasons. sharing volumes between them seems like a bad idea
[19:54:33] <Blondie101010> well ask the security advisor that recommended this
[19:54:35] <kittonian> there's much more going on with apache than just this one other container
[19:54:50] <kittonian> ha, i am the security advisor in this instance
[19:55:16] <Blondie101010> and you think the two should not contain the same files?
[19:56:33] <Blondie101010> I actually took that part for granted from the start
[19:56:53] <Blondie101010> so just put them at the same place
[19:57:27] <kittonian> let me try again
[19:57:45] <kittonian> there is one docker container that just runs apache as a proxy to serve websites to other containers
[19:57:55] <kittonian> there is another docker container running nextcloud-fpm
[19:58:01] <kittonian> i need to communicate between the two

[20:08:43] <kittonian> then i guess i didn't understand the question

[20:17:05] <kittonian> i even explicitly opened the port(s) in the docker-compose.yml file and it still doesn't change anything. keeps giving me a 404 not found.

[21:08:40] <kenoba> Blondie101010 how is it irrelevant? with php-fpm php process doesnt dies, meaning persistent connection is alive for next request and so on
[21:09:07] <__adrian> you could look into it (i haven't used persistent connections in redis) but i'd suggest figuring out a way to centralize that (or a centralized cache) might be more helpful
[21:09:17] <Blondie101010> you haven't read the page...  it's very very clear that it doesn't persist between calls
[21:09:29] <Blondie101010> and that would only be possible for an extention which is not the case either
[21:09:40] <Sammitch> the state of the process is entirely reset, and for all intents and purposes each FPM request should be _considered_ a fresh process
