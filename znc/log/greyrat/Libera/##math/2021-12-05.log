[00:00:07] <droid3> Some people might confuse measurable space with measure space the later has the measure included with it as a 3 tuple.
[00:02:16] <droid3> Obviously when you take a real analysis course they usually focus the course over R^n and subsets of them. But the measure theory need not be related to R^n we just go that route because usually useful integrals and measurable function that we want to work with are over domains/ranges of R^n
[00:05:35] <droid3> question 2) we know from real analysis if X= R^n then there will exist non-measurable set or we can always cook up examples of non-measurable sets for any sigma algebra we define.
[00:06:29] <droid3> But if we take a general set X will there always be non-measurable sets for any sigma algebra we define for it????
[00:07:39] <droid3> 3) if one has a measurable space can one always find a measure for it making it into a measure space?
[00:07:51] <laurus> droid3: these questions and more will be answered if you read a book on this
[00:08:54] <droid3> 4) can we classify up to isomorphism all the different measures one can define for a measurable space to be made into a measure space?
[00:09:56] <Z-module> zincy_: righto.
[00:11:05] <droid3> Those are 4 main question we all know sigma algebras, measurable sets , ....etc But it be nice to know how complete are measurable space and measure space are interms of not having to many non-measurable sets or being able to keep track of just what all the non-measurable set are.

[00:18:22] <droid3> Away of quickly grouping/finding all non-measurable functions over your two measurable spaces domain /ranges.
[00:20:31] <droid3> I guess where so quick to get into how to apply measure theory to integration to cook up lebesgue integration we dont take the time as much to study just measure theory by itself without getting to the appliction side of applying it to generalize integration to arbitrary sets.
[00:21:19] <Z-module> droid3: non-measurable sets and functions are slippery things. We can't describe any of them explicitly.

[00:24:41] <droid3> Z-module but thats the confusing route i think for students. It was for me back in the day because it just seems you could assign values in any way and integrate over any set because almost everything was a measurable set and function.
[00:25:18] <droid3> But is not the case but we usually have few examples of non-measurable sets and functions.
[00:26:07] <droid3> Its not even clear that why put it as one of the 4 question that there will be always non-measurable set in any sigma algebra you create for X.

[00:27:58] <droid3> For example take a set X and take the sigma algebra of P(X) the power set. Will the sigma algebra be strictly less then the P(X) if not then non-measurable set exist and all functions from this measurable space to this measurable space would be measurable functions.
[00:28:37] <droid3> Hence we could integrate any function over any set because all functions would be measurable and all set would be measurable sets!!!
[00:29:41] <droid3> This unfortunately i dont believe can be the case. Over X=R^n we have cantor sets ,...etc So over a general X set i imagine we have the the P(X) will always have non-measurable sets in it.
[00:31:00] <droid3> The point of the 4 questions can only be answered with deeper knowledge of measure theory as a subject alone /away from  its applied realms of generalizing integration and probability theory.

[01:01:37] <droid3> but i hope you now know the difference.
[01:02:26] <droid3> if we take a set X we can always take at least some subset of its power set P(X) and make it into a sigma algebra that subset.
[01:02:51] <droid3> For example {X,empty set} is trivially a sigma algebra for X.

[01:51:43] <droid3> one last thought maybe because this theory can get so general that you start to assign values anyway you want to things, and any set you want can be defined in a certain way ,....etc that the theory just becomes less useful as its to general with no geometrical intuition outside of R^n that becomes little useful to develop.
[01:52:55] <droid3> but certainly the idea of generalizing integration by generalizing the concept of measure and inventing measure theory is a cool idea.
[01:54:13] <droid3> And this measure theory obtained is now appliable to anything concept that need a generalized /abstract way of defining measure for an object independent of the integration theory application of it.

[02:22:57] <d3x0r> joel135 I do generally... the curvature maps he's talking about are like between them... how do I say this
[02:24:16] <d3x0r> so the basis maps of these various curavture systems he's talking about covers the coordinate space differently; if you use a cross product of them and make them a tangent of (spaceA/spaceB) - but a cross product is an orthagonal representation of them...  so in taking this complex cross product
[02:24:49] <d3x0r> and then watching how all the points actually realate, that maybe additional insight can be gleamed that a single basis map and orthagonal space built on that wouldn't

[02:30:56] <d3x0r> it's all based on a minkowski space (4d spacetime) though... so rotation is just change in position in a change in time, so now you have directions that are +delta position, +delta time, and +deltatime*deltaposition, and you lose distinction of which is which.   (and hyperbolic geometry to really make things confusing)
[02:31:26] <d3x0r> it's almost like the whole physics system is built in a way that can only be conceived of and there'd be no way to make a physical model of it on purpose ;)

[09:54:16] <ent58> I'm certain that means there's some distance/situation where the modulo behavior of the math will create a situation where it is ambiguous what "direction" I'm talking about

[09:58:33] <int-e> Modular arithmetic can sometimes be used instead of rational numbers when you know the final answer will be an integer. This can be particularly attractive in connection with the CRT (do machine word sized computation n times to get an almost n*<machine word width> bits result)
[10:00:06] <int-e> But in geometry you usually don't know that.
[10:00:11] <ent58> I'm essentially restricted to working within the confines of a 32-bit integer, but I can't make that assumption
[10:00:50] <ent58> well ultimately the result _will_ be an integer by the sheer fact that it's the only way I'm interpreting and storing the data, but I think you mean that in a stricter sense
[10:01:27] <int-e> Oh I mean the exact result. Rounding will just not work, indicated by the same 2^-1 = (p-1)/2 (mod p) example.
[10:01:48] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[10:02:08] <ent58> so you either have a metric with order where rounding makes sense
[10:02:36] <ent58> or because multiplicative inverses are part of the field, the position and meaning of what (1/2) (like you said) would be destroyed?
[10:03:02] <int-e> Basically, I'm only talking about field operations, and division can actually fail (you may accidentally end up dividing by 0 that was originally a non-zero rational number)

[10:05:16] <int-e> ent58: To me it really sounds like you'll have to deal with multiple precision arithmetic, as tedious as that is.
[10:05:40] <ent58> in a finite field, division will only fail if the number is truly zero though, right? because it's guaranteed that every element under multiplication has an inverse?
[10:06:22] <ent58> yeah it's looking like that, which I wanted to avoid...it's essentially recovering fixed point though
[10:07:43] <int-e> Yeah but if you want to do field operations in Q and you map those to some Z/pZ, then all multiples of p will be represented by 0. So you can get spurious divisions by 0, the simplest cast being 1/p (which has no corresponding element in Z/pZ).

[10:08:38] <int-e> (As p grows that case will become increasingly unlikely.)
[10:10:19] <ent58> yeah, using 2^31 - 1 as the modulus means that only happens at the very maximum of the unsigned representation of a regular 32 bit value
[10:10:41] <ent58> I'm willing to allow that to occur as there's a very fast way to check for that condition

[18:22:58] <Z-module> riv, if you're sampling, and I guess assuming the real population is roughly normal, then the usual version is  (n/(n - 1)) (the above stat), the so-called sample variation. But people apparently argue whether this is really an unbiased estimator of the true variance.
[18:23:06] <Z-module> sample variance*
[18:23:24] <riv> oh thank you!
[18:23:52] <callq> Problem: If you want to generate evenly-spaced intervals over a linear scale, the task simply involves dividing the range of a scale by the number of intervals and simply adding that dividend from the start of the range.

[19:39:25] <isekaijin> Ugh, so annoying. Students are given an odd discrete signal x[n] whose Fourier transform X(j\omega) is a periodic Dirac comb. The question is “for real values of \omega, is X(j\omega) imaginary?”
[19:40:12] <isekaijin> And some have answered “yes, because the signal is odd”, but others have answered “no, because for some values of \omega, X(j\omega) is not even a number”.
[19:40:55] <isekaijin> And at least one other TA has given full marks to both kinds of answer.
[19:42:16] <Franciman> wut?
[19:42:41] <isekaijin> Actually, both answers are “correct, if you interpret it generously”.
[19:43:31] <isekaijin> Let's consider the Dirac delta, i.e., \delta(t).
[19:43:37] <isekaijin> Of course, \delta(0) is not a real number.
[19:43:48] <isekaijin> But you can still talk about it being positive.
[19:44:10] <isekaijin> If you integrate it over an interval (-\varepsilon, \varepsilon), you get 1.
[19:44:13] <milia[m]> Well delta isn't a proper function but a distribution

[21:01:54] <[itchyjunk]> i don't understand why it's supposed to be 1/3
[21:04:16] <milia[m]> sometimes books have typos. I don't see how this limit ends up to a constant number. If you take D'Hospital: (2*z)/3 -> inf. Unless if I'm doing sth wrong.
[21:06:05] <milia[m]> how do you end up to 1/9 when you divide with 1/z^2? : 1/((3z)/z^2 + 1/z^2) = 1/((3/z) + 1/z^2)
[21:06:56] <milia[m]> this for z-> inf yields 1/(3/inf + 1/inf) -> 1/(0 + 0) -> 1/0 -> inf
[21:07:03] <milia[m]> so I guess D'Hospital was right
[21:07:22] <[itchyjunk]> because z^2/z^2 / (9z^2/z^2 + 6z/z^2 + 1/z^2)
[21:07:31] <[itchyjunk]> everything with z turns to 0

[21:34:08] <callq> Problem: If you want to generate evenly-spaced intervals over a linear scale, the task simply involves dividing the range of a scale by the number of intervals and simply adding that dividend from the start of the range. But now, imagine we have a log-scale graph. How do we calculate evenly-spaced intervals on that?
[21:35:59] <[itchyjunk]> I forgot how this proof went. I wts Re(z) has no derivative in C. let z = x+iy, x,y in R. Re(z) = x. U_x = 1, Vy = 0. U_x neq Vy for all x,y in R. therofre Re(z) has no derivaties at any point in C.

[22:59:21] <phao> mouseghost, Right. It's not an integer sequence. If it was, I'd be really surprised =) hehe
[22:59:32] <mouseghost> i dont know, maybe it is :P
[23:01:31] <phao> I have have to bound this: SUM_{n=n0}^inf R^{n^2}. I can do the obvious thing and bound this by R^{n0} SUM_{n=n0}^inf R^{n} = R^{2n0}/(1-R). I was hoping I could do better than that.

[23:15:11] *** diophantoz_ is now known as diophantoz
[23:15:50] <diophantoz> hello, if i have an equation for a circle like: x²+y²+13x-5y+44=0, and i want to the middle point and the radius, is completing the square the only way?
[23:16:00] <diophantoz> want to find*
[23:16:34] <diophantoz> when i tried to complete the square i got something strange because 13x is a wird number
[23:16:41] <diophantoz> weird*
[23:16:51] <phao> Not sure if it's the only way, but it's a pretty easy one.
[23:17:15] <diophantoz> okay, then i'm on the right track at least
[23:18:11] <phao> It still impresses me that you can do a bunch of algebraic manipulations, and get your equation in a form, and then state something geometrical about it.
[23:19:50] <diophantoz> all math impresses me
[23:19:57] <diophantoz> i guess i'm easily impressed
[23:20:02] <diophantoz> joooke

[23:21:27] <diophantoz> so i take 13*0.5 and then square the result : 6.5^2 = 42.25
[23:22:22] <diophantoz> milia[m], thank you
[23:22:50] <diophantoz> and then i do the same with the y-term (5) : 6.25.
[23:23:30] <diophantoz> so i have this: (x^2+13x+42.25)+(y^2-5y+6.25)=4.5
[23:24:16] <milia[m]> and you want to reach a form (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = c ?
[23:24:20] <diophantoz> yes
[23:24:40] <milia[m]> I'd complete the squares
[23:25:21] <phao> diophantoz, It's essencially done
[23:25:54] <diophantoz> i don't see it

[23:26:15] <phao> Well, do you know why you're working with 6.5 and with 2.5? And getting the 6.25 and 42.25?
[23:27:07] <phao> I mean, you work with 6.5 because it's the half of 13.
[23:27:51] <phao> you want to write 13 as 13 = 2k so that x^2 + 2k can be written as x^2 + 2k + k^2 - k^2. You know also that (x+k)^2 is x^2 + 2k + k^2, which gives: x^2 + 2k = x^k + 2k + k^2 - k^2 = (x+k)^2 - k^2.
[23:28:23] <phao> That is why you compute 13/2 and the square of it. It's that kind of calculation that should be going on.
[23:28:45] <phao> using the known expression for (x+k)^2 = x^k + 2kx + k^2
[23:29:02] <phao> (I forgot the x in the 2k above!! they should be 2xk.
[23:29:04] <phao> let me re-write it)
[23:29:26] <diophantoz> right, so 6.5^2 = 42.25
[23:29:36] <phao> you want to write 13 as 13 = 2k so that x^2 + 2kx can be written as x^2 + 2kx + k^2 - k^2. You know also that (x+k)^2 is x^2 + 2kx + k^2, which gives: x^2 + 2kx = x^k + 2kx + k^2 - k^2 = (x+k)^2 - k^2.
[23:29:37] <diophantoz> i think i get it
