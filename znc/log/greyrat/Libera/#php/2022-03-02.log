[01:41:21] <Azrael_-> i'm writing a billing program as a website and there you can add articles using javascript. the total of the bill is also updated on the fly directly in js. currently i'm calculating the numbers twice, once in js for the display and once upon receiving the data in php when saving. i hate the duplicate logic in different languages. how could i solve this best?
[01:41:42] <Woet> Azrael_-: you pick one and pass it to the other.
[01:41:57] <Azrael_-> Woet: mind to elaborat?
[01:41:57] <Woet> Azrael_-: if you can trust the client (99% in cases, you cant), you use JS to put it in an input field and send it to PHP
[01:42:17] <Woet> vice versa, if you don't trust the client (aka 99% of cases), you calculate it using AJAX in PHP and then send it to JS.
[01:42:27] <Azrael_-> so using ajax for after every edit and then calculate everything in php
[01:42:36] <Woet> if you mind the duplicate code that much, yes
[01:43:39] <Azrael_-> some of the main problems are the edge cases where the rounding of the numbers is treated a little bit different in the languages and thus i get occasionally different numbers (one cent max, but that's already too much)

[11:16:30] <Naktibalda> Dro_: you could start by profiling it and see what takes so long.
[11:17:01] <Naktibalda> Since you complain about api client, most likely the slow part is in the API.

[11:34:41] <Dro_> I think I'll change my plans to download the model in my app and modify it with some other libraries
[11:35:14] <TinoDidriksen> Any reason you use GDocs instead of a local file? LibreOffice can run headless, and its files are just zipped XML. Or you can generate HTML and render that to a PDF.

[14:36:42] <[twisti]> i would prefer not to download and store the file locally
[14:39:54] <Naktibalda> [twisti]: you have to retrieve and pass along Content-Disposition header
[14:40:32] <Naktibalda> if filename is part of original URL, you have to parse it and set your own Content-Disposition header.
[14:43:52] <Kartagis> What does #[\ReturnTypeWillChange] mean in a class?
[14:44:44] <Naktibalda> it prevents some warning about incorrect type
[14:44:47] <Kartagis> It's not highlighted like a comment.
[14:44:56] <Naktibalda> this is PHP8 attribute

[15:54:11] <stenno> hello, i hope this is the right channel to ask - i have a permission issue with apache, mod_php and my symfony app. So my symfony app belongs to the user 'stenno'. apache mod_php handles my requests, and creates cache and log directories and files owned by the apache user. now if i want to execute, say, a cache:clear  command as 'stenno' user, i get permission issues.
[15:54:44] <stenno> i could give my user sudo and then do `sudo -u apache bin/console cache:clear`
[15:55:08] <stenno> i could tell mod_php to use 'stenno' instead of 'apache' user somehow?
[15:55:33] <stenno> what is the preferred way of handling such an issue
[15:55:43] <stenno> i tend to the second
[15:57:03] <stenno> second would mean setting the username/group directly in httpd.conf

[16:15:55] <stenno> never mind, i think i will find the solution here https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/file_permissions.html
[16:17:14] <AllenJB> I would recommend creating an application specific user for the app to run as. You also run any manual commands as that user. That way the application does not have access to any non-application files.
[16:17:50] <AllenJB> php-fpm also allows you to run web requests as a specific user.
[16:18:30] <AllenJB> If your application has any crons, consider what user those should run as (I would say preferably the application user)
[16:20:17] <stenno> AllenJB: 'I would recommend creating an application specific user' - this is exactly what i am attempting to do. unfortunately now i am still stuck with mod_php and not php-fpm

[16:29:49] <AllenJB> nowt wrong with that if what you already know is a good tool for the job.

[21:50:01] <olle> What's the benefit of using refresh token + sessions token VS having a permanent API token?
[21:50:27] <olle> I don't get it. Why establish a session token when the refresh token is permanent anyway?
[21:50:39] <olle> Might as well use that one all the time.
[21:53:09] <Sammitch> extra steps == security?
[21:55:22] *** Quits: sidy (~sidy@user/sidy) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:55:39] <olle> xD
[21:55:44] <__adrian> refresh tokens don't grant access. and when the request comes, you can decide whether you're going to grant a new access token or not.
[21:55:58] <da_wunder> with refresh token you could make some extra checks if that user is authenticated to use your application
[21:57:26] <Sammitch> so is it purely to define separate tokens for authentication and access, and not necessarily a security thing at all?
[21:57:51] <olle> "    TL;DR refresh_token does not bring increased security. It's for the purpose to improve scalability and performance. Then, access_token may be stored just in some fast, temporary storage (like memory). It allows the authorization and resource server separation, too."
[22:01:24] <olle> Eeeeh, making the access token not-revokable --> better scale, but worse security
[22:01:33] <olle> So stateless access token
[22:01:35] <olle> That suckzzz
[22:02:05] <__adrian> i'd never thought about the scaling implications, but definitely
[22:02:43] <olle> Another case of "we're just doing it because that's what google is doing" without considering that few are like google -.-
[22:03:17] <__adrian> permanent access tokens are still problematic.

[22:05:26] <Sammitch> revocation requires a central authority
[22:06:14] <olle> Sure

[22:06:23] <Sammitch> and an "is this revoked?" check every single time the token is used

[23:51:20] <relipse> it was recommende that we move to php-fpm
[23:51:26] <relipse> is that recommendation sound?
[23:51:54] <__adrian> the correct recommendation (whether you choose to use php-fpm or not) is to properly configure your server
[23:52:08] <relipse> are you angry at me?
[23:52:20] <__adrian> don't allow it to try to use more memory than you have.

[23:53:03] <relipse> what advice did I ignore?
[23:54:04] <__adrian> people have been telling you to configure your server (db, fpm, etc.) properly according to what server resources you have and what load it needs to handle
[23:54:18] <__adrian> and instead, you're looking for a magic solution by switching sapis.
[23:54:47] <relipse> yeah I'm working on all that now
[23:55:00] <relipse> but someone in #maria recommended I use php-fpm and that would help with memory
[23:55:09] <__adrian> e.g., if you have 8GB, and tell apache that it can run 10 php processes with 1 GB each, and then also run mysql, that's not apache's fault when it gets killed for using too much memory.
