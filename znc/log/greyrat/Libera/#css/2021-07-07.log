[21:53:17] <matsaman> it's weird how long it takes managers to realize that _if_ they are able to assess whether an employee is doing their job at all or not (a big if, given how inept most managers are), that not coming into work saves literally bajillions of hours of wasted effort
[21:53:39] <matsaman> I do miss going in some, though
[21:53:52] <matsaman> I would definitely go in more than not at all, at this point
[21:54:12] <matsaman> except I'm only ever wasting my time during work hours at this point, 'cause IT doesn't allow me to not waste my time
[21:54:23] <matsaman> 'cause the company owner put an idiot in charge of IT
