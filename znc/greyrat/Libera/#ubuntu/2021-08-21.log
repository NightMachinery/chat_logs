[01:09:59] <bm> What exactly does pressing CTRL-C do in Terminal? I can see from my program's behavior that it does something more than just sent SIGINT.
[01:10:33] <sarnold> It Depends
[01:11:22] <sarnold> the stty tool can change what ^C does, and programs can do something similar themselves
[01:11:39] <sarnold> and programs can of course install signal handlers to catch the signal and do whatever they want to do when they receive it
[01:12:34] <devslash> yea but I hate when applications trap Ctrl C or Ctrl X and ignore it
[01:12:35] <blueskies> @sarnold, same issue still
[01:12:36] <bm> That's the thing. I catch SIGINT in my program and its behavior is different when I press CTRL-C or do "kill -SINT <pid>"
[01:13:02] <bm> That's why I suspect it does something more behind the scenes.
[01:14:13] <bm> I suspect it also sends that signal to child processes for some reason

[02:23:47] <TJ-> davido_: so you only seem to have IPv4 available; I'd have expected to see the IPv6 addresses listed too. Does your system have any kind of HTTTP{S} proxy configured?

[02:24:02] <davido_> No.
[02:24:27] <davido_> Additionally, I am able to successfully curl the URL.
[02:25:04] <TJ-> davido_: yes I noted that, which was why I wondered about IPv6 vs IPv4 - often times some tools prefer a specidic address family whereas others will let the OS decide
[02:25:13] <davido_> Ah, thanks.

[02:26:45] <davido_> Yes.
[02:27:57] <TJ-> davido_: so my feeling is your system may have a local IPv6 address and therefore since changelogs also has an IPv6 is preferring to use IPv6 but your network doesn't have global connectivity.Let's try to prove that, so we know what to do. " pastebinit <( ip -6 addr show; ip -6 route show ) "
[02:29:49] <davido_> Interestingly, pastebinit also fails, but here's a manual paste: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/3TbpMvq62s/

[02:58:38] <TJ-> that's where the changelogs.ubuntu.com files are stored locally. You'll have a meta-release there too
[02:59:25] <davido_> I can manually twiddle that file, but how do I get do-release-upgrade to use it?
[02:59:27] <TJ-> What is fetched depends on whether you've configured the system to do non-LTS upgrades
[02:59:42] <davido_> I have configured it to allow non-LTS
[02:59:57] <TJ-> davido_: make the file immutable possibly; so it cannot be over-ridden, with "chattr +i ..."
[03:00:59] <davido_> wouldn't matter, though. The script dies before it gets an opportunity to use the file.
[03:01:03] <davido_> Also that file seems quite outdated.
[03:01:18] <davido_> My instance of it ends with 18.04.1
[03:01:19] <TJ-> davido_: but I do not see anything in there to affect a choice. The entry for 20.04.2 is a TARGET for a previous release to upgrade to, not a control for the existing install
[03:01:37] <davido_> Ah, got it.
[03:02:01] <TJ-> davido_: if d-r-u dies first then editing won't help
[03:02:58] <TJ-> but the fact it ends at 18.04.1 means it hasn't been replace in ages. Have you done a "sudo apt update; sudo apt full-upgrade" before starting d-r-u - that'll often bring in latest requirements for upgrade-manager
[03:03:09] <davido_> Right. I need to dive into the code and its dependencies. Within the python code for do-release-upgrade, step through, figure out where it's specifically dieing.
[03:03:25] <davido_> Yeah, I do that more often that you might imagine. :)

[06:42:10] <sarnold> fikran: sorry..
[06:42:53] <sarnold> fikran: the snap has version 20.10.8 available in the latest/beta channel; the focal release has 20.10.7 available in the security updates pocket
[06:43:16] <sarnold> fikran: so there *is* a 'newer' snap than the distro release, but not by much, and not in the stable channel
[06:44:19] <fikran> oh wait, might be because im running an older ubuntu
[06:44:32] <fikran> wonder how to upgrade...
[06:45:53] <sarnold> sudo do-release-upgrade
[06:46:53] * fikran tries...

Some devices require a key to be pressed to enable booting external media (ie security; even key pressed when device is off for some & when held device will turn on & boot thumb-drive).

[14:17:56] <hajonnes> alkisg, because I want it to be automatically updated when a new version exist and I want the system to take care of it. Also during the installation of ubuntu, is not all graphics drivers installd as 'auto' so why should my system not accept it when it is marked 'auto'? Did I think wrong?
[14:19:02] <hajonnes> I installed a couple of days ago and ubuntu has choosen what graphics to install.
[14:19:03] <alkisg> hajonnes: "manual" means "don't autoremove it even if no package depends on it"

[14:19:28] <alkisg> ubuntu-desktop or other metapackages depend on xorg and the drivers etc, but not on nvidia

[14:25:10] <hajonnes> alkisg, ok, so generally If I do a new installation, because that is what I did, the first autoremove I do would brake it, since it would remove the graphics drivers that the installation installed? I used kde-neon (ubuntu base) before and had not any problems like this and wonder if I have accidentally removed some packages over my graphics driver in the dependency hierarchy? Is this normal?

[14:25:58] <alkisg> hajonnes: normally, the installer (ubiquity) runs ubuntu-drivers, which installs nvidia, while marking it as manually installed
[14:26:16] <alkisg> So it's not autoremoved. If it was set to "auto" for you, then yeah it sounds like you removed something.
[14:27:39] <alkisg> I do not have nvidia to verify what I'm saying though, I stopped using nvidia and the binary drivers more than a decade ago...
[14:28:44] <alkisg> In any case, if setting it to "manual" now corrects all your issues, then it's the right thing to do; it'll auto-update etc
[14:29:07] <alkisg> It's not "apt mark hold", which means "stick to this version"... it's "manual", which means "don't autoremove it"

[14:41:22] <hajonnes> alkisg, the initial issu was that I got a lot of graphics dependencies to be autoremoved. I autoremoved all and noticed that my graphics were broken. I reinstalled ubuntu thinking I had done something that I did not understand, I read that apt purge could remove shared dependencies, others say it just removes settings files, perhaps you could clarify that as well, anyway. I reinstalled and installed timeshift and was cautious about using apt
[14:41:22] <hajonnes> autoremove. I have done some apt purges. but not tried autoremove, then I did 'apt-get --dry-run autoremove' to see what would be removed and saw graphics packages. I used apt-rdepends to see what was missing, and saw that nvidia-driver-470 was missing. I installed it and then all the graphics packages were no longer in autoremove. but still I'm wondering what is wrong, if there is a package that I'm missing that is higher in the dependency hierarchy
[14:41:23] <hajonnes> that is missing and would give me problems later on.
[14:42:24] <TJ-> Safiyyah: before you do another reboot, you don't need to! Simply log-out and log-in again, that restarts the display server, or, you can do "sudo systemctl restart display-manager"

[14:44:04] *** Quits: ice99 (~ice9@user/ice9) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[14:44:33] <alkisg> hajonnes: for example, if package A depends on B, and B recommends C, and you purge B, at that point, A will also be removed, while C will be removed later on when you run autoremove
[14:44:35] *** Joins: ice99 (~ice9@user/ice9)
[14:45:11] <alkisg> hajonnes: so when you `apt purge` something, be extra careful in the messages; if it says "the following packages are automatically installed and can be autoremoved", it means you did what I described above with package B
[14:45:14] <TJ-> Safiyyah: As I said earlier: there is a command called 'touch' and it simply updates the timestamp of a file, creating the file if needed. It's a nice way to check something happened and when. So you could add "touch /tmp/kensington" to the end of your script and after restarting the display server if "ls -l /tmp/kensington" shows the file you can see when it was last executed via the file's
[14:45:16] <TJ-> timestamp

[14:45:32] <hajonnes> alkisg, I did no 'apt autoremove' after just installing it, it was a couple of days later. I had done some 'apt purge'. does 'apt purge' remove shared dependencies or just settings files for the program?

[14:45:43] <hajonnes> it beeing ubuntu.

[14:46:21] <hajonnes> TJ-, so then apt purge is not dangerous?
[14:46:27] <alkisg> hajonnes: `apt remove` removes dependencies but not files in /etc. While `apt purge` also removes files in /etc. Both remove dependencies

[14:49:15] <alkisg> hajonnes: please read my example of A, B and C. I phrased it much better than the way you're asking about it now
[14:49:46] <alkisg> If you remove B, **any** package that depends on B, will also be removed. It doesn't matter if it's "shared" or otherwise
[14:49:58] <Safiyyah> TJ-,  yeii https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/tmzN2gKw3q/ although that means my machine does't like the script
[14:51:01] <hajonnes> alkisg, I did not understad perhaps. if package A has dependency c and package B has dependency c. I purge package A will c be removed?
[14:51:06] <TJ-> Safiyyah: so the good part is the script is executing
[14:51:21] <TJ-> Safiyyah: I think you said earlier the script did work from the user session?
[14:51:41] <alkisg> hajonnes: no, "c" is still needed by "b". It won't be removed, nor will it be autoremoved
[14:52:08] <TJ-> Safiyyah: ahhh, I know what is wrong, the script is written for BASH but Xsession uses SH and there are what we cann bash-isms in that script. Let me rewrite it for you
[14:52:18] <hajonnes> alkisgk, ok then I could not have removed any packages wrongly.

[16:57:19] <cbreak> norgems: can't you just apt remove all the things?
[16:57:29] <cbreak> or was it uninstall? one of those
[16:57:43] <norgems> https://pastebin.com/EXSpvpGD
[16:57:49] <norgems> i cant do either

[16:59:13] <cbreak> I'm quite sure it's not the correct thing to do, but when I have dependency problems with apt, I usually try to install the things it says won't be installed manually
[16:59:22] <cbreak> this usually then gives an other error message, with an other dep to follow
[16:59:35] <cbreak> and eventually I arrive at something that isn't installed for some other reason
[16:59:43] <cbreak> possibly a conflict with some other thing that's installed

[17:01:29] <Euph0r1a> hello, gentlemens
[17:02:18] <Euph0r1a> i'm trying ubuntu first time on a WLS right now, so far looks really fun :)
[17:02:29] <Euph0r1a> any advices for a newbie, please?
[17:04:35] <hajonnes> alkisg, I'm back, did you have time to check out the pastebin?
[17:05:09] *** Joins: james_lavin (~jameslavi@ool-457981b2.dyn.optonline.net)
[17:06:11] <cbreak> Euph0r1a: Ubuntu's a normal desktop system. You should be able to do pretty much do most of what ever you want.
[17:06:33] <cbreak> just apt install the packages you need
[17:06:43] <Euph0r1a> any must-have pacjkages, maybe?
[17:06:47] <cbreak> apt install firefox for a good web browser
[17:07:02] <Euph0r1a> just didnt want to miss something important :)
[17:07:06] <cbreak> apt install kitty for a good terminal emulator
[17:07:19] <cbreak> many linux tools are very customizable
[17:07:28] <cbreak> which means you might have to spend time customizing them.
[17:08:14] <Euph0r1a> okay, so just dl firefox and i'm free like a wind
[17:08:17] <cbreak> apt install hexchat for an ok-ish IRC client
[17:08:18] <Euph0r1a> thanks :3

[19:52:26] <Jenshae> Hi all, I have done some terrible things to my system without enough research. I am hoping someone can help me unpick this mess.
[19:52:31] <Jenshae> I installed too new a version of the kernel (5.11) from the website (unsigned), then I installed a higher version of libc6.

[19:52:33] <Jenshae> I tried installing signed kernels and using the main repositories. I am now in a situation where:
[19:52:56] <Jenshae> - 5.11 is signed but has no network and only one monitor.
[19:53:03] <Jenshae> - 5.8 won't boot at all.
[19:53:19] <Jenshae> - 5.13 boots, is unsigned and has no ZFS.

[21:49:42] <leftyfb> Jenshae: what release are you running and how in the world did to get it into this state?
[21:49:42] <tomreyn> sounds more like a release upgrade
[21:50:22] <Jenshae> Yup, I originally tried to only upgrade the kernel and get Variable Refresh Rate working. Then I needed libc6 upgraded and the rabbit hole kept going from there. I can't even use VRR it turns out because I have two displays.
[21:50:36] <leftyfb> :/

[21:51:01] <leftyfb> Jenshae: future reference, you should never install packages (including kernels ) from a different release
[21:51:21] <Jenshae> I now have all of your uncommented repos and that is what is happening with the 5.13 kernel.
[21:51:52] <hajonnes> alkisg, leftyfb, yes. but e.g. windows. drag the bottom of the window to the bottom of the screen and it elongates both up and down. kde-plasma, middle mouse click on the middle button up in the corner of the window and it elongates to maximum. is there a similar way in gnome?

[21:53:55] <leftyfb> Jenshae: if you have issues, come here and ask for help. Don't go installing random packages you download. You'll get into a very unsupported situation and usually broken
[21:53:56] <Jenshae> I have learnt quite a bit with this trial and error approach. Mostly about why they "freeze" versions.
[21:54:49] <alkisg> Jenshae: ubuntu 20.04 has kernel 5.11; you don't need to get it from the mainline ppa; and your actual issue probably is that you didn't download the 5.11 kernel modules
[21:54:54] <leftyfb> Jenshae: 5.13 should be available for ubuntu 21.10 which will be out in October, but it's not released yet and not supported. This is probably how you found it on ubuntu's website
[21:55:01] <alkisg> While if you properly updated, you'd have the official 5.11 along with its modules

[22:38:40] <tomreyn> so you're comparing results of two end of life releases. there's commercial extended support available for those, but not here.
[22:38:42] <Junxter> i think the ps_mem indication is closer to actual usage. not sure what to make of the "used" number reported in free

[22:42:12] <tomreyn> 20.04 LTS is supported, sure. :) the difference is probably due to these tools calculating it differently. which ps_mem do you use?

[22:47:54] <Junxter> "used memory" reported by vmstat -sSM is in agreement with free -h, namely 165M, whereas ps_mem reports 230M.
[22:48:50] <Junxter> if I may, the amount of disagreement is much smaller than previous versions though.  So on 20.04, seems to be fine ?
[22:49:14] <tomreyn> so you have two system utilities reporting merely the same, and one other utility reporting something different. this would make me want to understand what this other utility (ps_mem) does , and does differently
[22:49:28] <Junxter> sure
[22:49:33] <rfm> Junxter, I have no idea what ps_mem is or does, but if it's adding up the memory used by each process, it will multi- count any shared memory
[22:49:53] <Junxter> ah that's why
[22:50:10] <Junxter> ps_mem reports memory usage of individual processes, and then tallies them up
[22:50:44] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[22:51:21] <Junxter> on my other 20.04 host, this pattern is seen repeated.   free -h / vmstat in agreement slightly under ps_mem grand total (double counted)
[22:51:34] <Junxter> thanks for the help. this clarifies things and make me more comfortable with 20.04
