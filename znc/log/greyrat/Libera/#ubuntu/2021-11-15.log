[16:25:11] <Tamburino> Hello all, i want to buy a new Computer but it is hard to figure out if all parts runs natively from scratch without fancy stuff or proprietary drivers. Could anyone help me please? Any experience with the Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master Mainboard?
[16:29:07] <oerheks> you might want to visit #hardware for that?
[16:29:36] <Tamburino> Thanks
[16:30:01] <oerheks> basicly, all you need is to check out the videocard/gpu, for now AMD is supported fine, Nvidia we are still waiting for drivers that work with wayland.
[16:30:24] <oerheks> motherboards are practically all supported, also cpu's
[16:30:51] <Tamburino> and what about every tiny chipset on the board? like ethernet from realtek, the sound? wifi onboard? fan and temperature i/o chipsets?
[16:31:40] <oerheks> wifi could be your only concern, check out https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/
[16:32:21] <Tamburino> And i read that on some boards (most) linux is not able to read fan speed, temperature from sensors and so on?
[16:32:49] <oerheks> no, you read that wrong.
[16:33:04] <jkc> A word of warning, you're not likely to get away from proprietary drivers in some cases, most notably GPUs.
[16:33:44] <jkc> Unless advancements have been made in the open-source replacements (e.g. nouveau) that I am unaware of, which is distinctly possible.
[16:34:56] <Tamburino> That is why i ask here, i don't want to use any proprietary driver. and for the gpu i want to use amd with the open source driver
[16:35:14] <jkc> I don't know how well AMD GPUs work with the open source drivers, I've never tested.
[16:35:15] <oerheks> good choice, for now

I changed it to 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1, so it works, I can access internet. But after I reboot or connect to a VPN network, DNS server is automatically set back to 127.0.0.53. It's really annoying that I have to change it everytime. How do I fix this?

[21:32:49] <Gallomimia> i think if you replaced your whole disk, you should describe the procedure you used to move your files to the new one. if in doubt, use the installer Live(Cd/USB) to repair it
[21:33:07] <Gallomimia> alas, i've never ever had any luck cloning an install of ubuntu
[21:33:49] <hello21> OK :D Thanks a lot for very fast answer, after replacement the disk, I somehow installed GUB2, but it's running only in console mode (menu is missing). I'm able to boot to the ubuntu from GRUB command mode, but I don't know, how to take back the GRUB boot menu. I tried the boot-repair (not helped). I tried grub-customizer, here I can see the menu items, but after restart grub is running still in console mode. :-(

[21:36:48] <Gallomimia> oh dear. this won't help, but when ever i had this kind of problem, it was because of my strange RAID and crypto arrangement. i usually had to create a chroot from the installer disk, mount my system and do a grub-update. very frustrating
