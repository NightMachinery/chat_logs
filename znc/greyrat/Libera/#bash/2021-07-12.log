[00:12:08] <hid3> Greetings everyone. I am using the following grep line to capture required information in my script: grep -o ^md[0-9] /path/to file. It captures md0...md9 strings fine, however, md10 and further doesn't get captured. What's the most efficient range to amend the grep string to be able to capture md0...md999 strings?

[01:23:02] <{xmb}> doc explains it a bit, o and o2 are examples
[01:23:54] <eschwartz> > link filenames to bash internals via bash code
[01:24:01] <{xmb}> ./bash <args as project main trees> puts the files ( the non dirs ) to ./gawk which forms bash code evaled then back ( via . <( .., ) )
[01:24:06] <eschwartz> I'm not completely sure what this means?
[01:24:24] <llua> just back away slowly
[01:24:25] <{xmb}> i have tried this sentense part a few times differently as i wouldnt know how to explain
[01:24:49] <{xmb}> it, in later form, will support more than set/shopt/declare

[01:25:35] *** Parts: YaoNai (~YaoNai@user/yaonai) ()
[01:25:37] <{xmb}> i have a more difficult bash only version which supports more, but this ./gawk replaces all the bash code for final to-be-evaled code, for speed
[01:25:48] <{xmb}> say, i make a modular httpd like this, i need speed for every spawn
[01:27:31] <{xmb}> so if u can try, try bash bash ., and xdlp= bash bash .
[01:27:45] <{xmb}> first one includes, what second one prints
[01:28:02] <twobitsprite> the 156 character line redefining the same variable make me not even want to know any more about this :P

[01:47:20] <{xmb}> yes
[01:47:23] <twobitsprite> so, you have gawk scripts that generate bash code?
[01:47:26] <{xmb}> yes

[01:47:29] <twobitsprite> why?

[01:47:52] <twobitsprite> what kind of bash code are you generating?
[01:47:52] <{xmb}> it sourced for 1s or so
[01:47:59] <{xmb}> not acceptable for bashrc or httpdrc
[01:48:06] <{xmb}> only defining code
[01:48:10] <{xmb}> as split by bash itself
[01:48:13] <{xmb}> like
[01:48:16] <{xmb}> var=content
[01:48:23] <{xmb}> where content is \c\o\n\t\e\n\t
[01:48:35] <{xmb}> or foo() { <bar of file> \n} \n\n
[01:48:37] <eschwartz> ok...
[01:48:40] <twobitsprite> ok, so you have gawk scripts, which generate bash scripts, so you can define bash variables?
[01:48:43] <eschwartz> it produces lines like:
[01:48:45] <eschwartz> set -a -b -B -h -H -m +e +t 
[01:48:49] <eschwartz> declare -A assoctest[\a\/\b\/\c]=\a\b\c 
[01:48:53] <eschwartz> shopt -s checkwinsize dotglob expand_aliases extglob globstar gnu_errfmt lastpipe nullglob 
[01:49:09] <{xmb}> yes it does, besides declare should be after shopt
[01:49:17] <{xmb}> that is, the stuff defined in its subdirs
[01:49:23] <{xmb}> the set/ shopt/ and declare/
[01:49:34] <{xmb}> alias/ and funciton/ should work too but i havent tried much
[01:49:37] <twobitsprite> so, why not just have files that define those variables instead of gawk scripts to generate scripts to define those variables?
[01:49:41] <eschwartz> and it is *serialized* from filenames.
[01:49:41] <{xmb}> keyword is more complicated
[01:49:55] <{xmb}> that is so twobits
[01:50:03] <eschwartz> twobitsprite: apparently the *filesystem* is the bash script
[01:50:03] <{xmb}> have em in files
[01:50:06] <{xmb}> that is just the linker
[01:50:10] <twobitsprite> are you just trying to re-write bash *in* bash?
[01:50:13] <{xmb}> that links the content or whatever right to bash standards

[01:51:10] <{xmb}> yes filesystem, freely takeable as resources city
[01:51:22] <eschwartz> the gawk script reads a flat-file database using flag files as its content store, and converts them to actual 'set' commands
[01:51:22] <twobitsprite> I'm smoking pot and I'm still lost... (in case anyone was wondering if this would make more sense if you were high :P)
[01:51:40] <eschwartz> and declare and alias and suchlike commands
[01:52:05] <{xmb}> yes it only decides by filenames, and depends that args are filenames only (no dirs, so i [[ ! -d in ./bash a loop before going, which i dont like because of speed lost too
[01:52:17] <twobitsprite> so.... you want to use filenames to generate scripts...?
[01:52:33] <{xmb}> yes in the more later versions, if u can maybe motivate me, it will have more common-coding-facility related supported stuff offering
[01:52:45] <{xmb}> i dont generate a script really
[01:52:50] <eschwartz> {xmb} I would just use an actual script rather than *generating* a script
[01:52:52] <{xmb}> it can be a script if you printf it out there
[01:52:56] <twobitsprite> why would we want to motivate you?
[01:53:03] <twobitsprite> what is the point?
[01:53:03] <{xmb}> but i try runtime binding of features, by filesystem entries differencies
[01:53:08] <eschwartz> you do generate a script, which you either cat or eval
[01:53:18] <{xmb}> why not, .. hm 
[01:53:30] <eschwartz> generating a script and evaling it instead of printf'ing it, is still generating a script
[01:53:39] <{xmb}> eschwartz my point with the whole was, i cant stack quotes well so without separation
[01:53:47] <{xmb}> also, its nice to have big split right
[01:53:53] <{xmb}> i can proove maybe later
[01:54:04] <{xmb}> but you mean why i gawk ?

[01:54:33] <twobitsprite> I mean, you can split scripts, but no need to generate them from filenames....
[01:54:38] <{xmb}> its not made fool proof
[01:54:50] <{xmb}> like, set/on/'a b c' will give some error
[01:54:54] <{xmb}> its for code it right

[01:55:10] <{xmb}> its not in the end generate but okay
[01:55:14] <{xmb}> its split scripts yes
[01:55:18] <{xmb}> but then you need the linker system
[01:55:21] <{xmb}> tadaa, there
[01:55:34] <twobitsprite> linker system is just "." or "source"
[01:55:35] <eschwartz> meanwhile I'm still laughing that *xmb* told off Peng Yu for using incomprehensible word salad

[01:56:27] <eschwartz> Peng Yu is using word salad

[01:56:55] <twobitsprite> what do you mean by "stack aliases"?
[01:57:04] <{xmb}> stack quotes
[01:57:09] <eschwartz> if you can figure out what on earth Peng Yu means by this sentence, please enlighten me...
[01:57:18] <{xmb}> which sentense
[01:57:22] <twobitsprite> eschwartz: fair enough :P
[01:57:38] <{xmb}> ah
[01:57:40] <twobitsprite> {xmb}: can you give me an example of "stack quotes"?
[01:57:51] <{xmb}> he cant otherwise than eval code to check for valid code
[01:57:54] <{xmb}> is my guess
[01:58:12] <{xmb}> yes, alias foo='a b ; gawk ''''''''
[01:58:15] <{xmb}> quotes problem
[01:58:33] <{xmb}> for this, there is alias/foo, and bin/foo.gawk, 
[01:58:50] <{xmb}> and in the end, you can make english style story names and use it to code your manuscripts this style
[01:59:02] <twobitsprite> generally if you can't do it with an alias, you just write it as a function. much simpler
[01:59:16] <{xmb}> yea...
[01:59:17] <eschwartz> or the poor souls could learn to use basic quotes when obviously needed
[01:59:20] <{xmb}> hmrmrmrhfpff
[01:59:22] <twobitsprite> story names? manuscripts? ok, now I'm even more lost
[01:59:31] <{xmb}> naming
[01:59:36] <{xmb}> you short name code
[01:59:38] <{xmb}> shortened coding
[01:59:47] * eschwartz imagines people writing python generators that read 'def func():' descriptions from files
[01:59:47] <{xmb}> by having all procedures ready, as meaningful names
[01:59:56] <twobitsprite> eschwartz: exactly
[02:00:01] <{xmb}> then you end up where youd write a 100 lines script in 5 lines manuscript
[02:00:10] <twobitsprite> {xmb}: sounds like a function... so why not just write a function?
[02:00:23] <{xmb}> there is, in function/<name>
[02:00:44] <{xmb}> where i also gotta say, that gawk belongs to bin/<here>
[02:00:46] <twobitsprite> {xmb}: but, why would I use your system instead of just the built-in function of bash?
[02:00:50] <{xmb}> cause then no quoting problem at all
[02:01:00] <{xmb}> cause when you quote gawk with ' you cant really well use ' inside
[02:01:10] <twobitsprite> {xmb}: quoting is only a problem if you don't know how the quoting syntax works

[03:36:12] <twobitsprite> ooooohhh... mae culpa
[03:36:42] <emanuele6> but the csv plugin is not particularly useful
[03:36:54] <eschwartz> they are different from external scripts/commands, because they can directly access bash's internal API to read/write variables, etc.

[03:44:50] <twobitsprite> the only reason to learn C is if you want to work on existing code to fix bugs or add features... anyone starting a new software project using C (which isn't embedded on extremely restricted hardware, but even then, I'd rather write in forth)
[03:45:08] <twobitsprite> ... is just masochistic
[03:45:23] <earnestly> eschwartz: Might update wiki if someone else doesn't if I remember
[03:45:48] <eschwartz> the problem is that the competition is still fairly limited. e.g. people keep mentioning rust, but... rust doesn't have reliable support for targets other than x86 and aarch64
[03:46:17] <eschwartz> they have multiple levels of fail there, including but not limited to depending on llvm

[03:47:32] <twobitsprite> tbh, I haven't done much with rust, but I do have quite a bit of experience with golang

[03:48:32] <twobitsprite> ok, yeah
[03:48:57] <twobitsprite> the only reason I mentioned rust is that it doesn't have a runtime, so is a bit more light-weight, if that's what you're looking for

[05:29:04] <kurahaupo> One possible solution would be to use heredocs to hold the sub-script text. But as a starting point, I would move the sudo outside the script, and just run "sudo yourscript"

[06:28:30] <wwilliam> geirha: Thank you.
[06:28:33] <kurahaupo> One of my earliest recollections of the shared root password was being left in charge while my boss was on leave. So I changed the root password and put it in a sealed envelope pinned to the wall in the server room and told the CEO where to find it "if anyone needs it". The next day I got a phone call from my workaholic boss…

[15:06:19] <pj> af: := is an assignment, but that's also expanded out and returned, so it needs to be an arg to a command.
[15:06:50] <pj> So in this casse the command is unimportant, just that there has to be a command there, so :, being the null command is used.

[20:14:57] <cousteau> sudomann: the standard output of foo.sh is redirected as the standard input for consume.sh 
[20:15:13] <cousteau> The standard output is what the program normally prints to screen 
[20:15:55] <mac11> say for example you want to change a word in a txt file you would do 
[20:16:24] <mac11> cat text.txt | sed 's/word/replacementword/g'
[20:16:32] <cousteau> And the standard input what the program reads from the keyboard (although I'd say most of the time stdin is expected to come from another command or file, not manual input) 
[20:17:07] <sudomann> so if foo.sh is taking forever to complete something, writing out bits of text throughout, consume.sh will not be passed that text until foo.sh exits?s

[20:19:53] <N0ZYC> yu're scripting a web browser
[20:20:52] <cousteau> sudomann: so whenever the first program prints a line of text, it goes into the pipe, and whenever the second program requests to read text it has a line available in the pipe 
[20:20:53] <N0ZYC> with a bunch of hacks tacked onto it (like java, cgi, forms) to make up for the fact that it's not really a programming language at all

[22:34:33] <emg> junicchi: can you give more info as to where you got this string, why it looks like that, what you want to do with it, etc.? often answers to those questions can change the approach
[22:35:36] <jetchisel> probably from windoze machine ^^

[22:36:10] <junicchi> emg: that's the output of mysql
[22:36:15] <junicchi> the data is dict
[22:36:20] <junicchi> i mean json

[22:37:10] *** Quits: blink (~x@awknode.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:37:34] <emg> junicchi: does mysql give you a way to unescape the sql stuff? can you use a json program (like jq) to get the info you want so it's escaped/not escaped correctly?

[22:38:01] <junicchi> the string i sent above is the final string that i parsed with jq
[22:38:25] <junicchi> tbh the filepaths i'm going to use just will be abc/def/123123123.jpg
[22:38:34] <junicchi> so simply using tr -d '\' should work
[22:38:42] <junicchi> i'm lazy to find a healthy solution now
[22:38:52] <emg> but what about file paths that have a backslash?

[23:45:12] <FreeBDSM> hi. what's the most reliable check of a variable whether it contains specific string? `if [[ "${myvar}" == *'mysubstring'* ]]; ` ?
[23:45:52] <twkm> string or substring.  you checked for a substring.
[23:46:40] <twkm> reliable has an odd sound to me, in what way have you experienced unreliability?
[23:46:42] <FreeBDSM> twkm: 'contains' always means a substring
[23:46:58] <twkm> if you say so.
[23:47:14] <FreeBDSM> otherwise it'd be 'equals'
[23:47:24] <twkm> oh well.  /me wanders off
[23:47:30] <FreeBDSM> thanks

[23:51:14] <FreeBDSM> !capture stderr
[23:51:22] <FreeBDSM> !stderr
[23:51:22] <greybot> Standard Error is the secondary file descriptor to which commands print to the terminal. It's meant for messages that shouldn't be parsed by default. Redirect to stderr: '>&2'. See !stdout !stdin and !redirtut for more info.

[23:56:52] <gmcastil> thanks
[23:56:54] <FreeBDSM> did I get it right, that if I need to parse (match against substring) stderr's text I basically need to redirect it to a file and then grep that file?

[23:59:27] <geirha> I added %H to that date format too. Looked odd without it
[23:59:49] <FreeBDSM> isn't there a simpler solution to catch stderr like `stderrtext=$(mycommand 2> -)` or something like that?
