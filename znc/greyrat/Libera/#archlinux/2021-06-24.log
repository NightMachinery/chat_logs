[11:23:30] <th0rne> Try '<your favorite text editor> <your sysmodmap file>'.

[11:26:42] <kirk781> I have set it in xinitrc. It works when sysmodmap setting is enabled, the default state. I am merely curious as to watt the sysmodmap resource did when a usermodmap one exists and why the latter refused to load despite in xinitrc file just because I uncommented the sysmodmap line

[12:29:06] <haroon> Hi I'm trying to setup a custom file in /etc/sudoder.d. I copied the sudoers file and modified it. I would expect, that the modifications in /etc/sudoers.d would override the configuration in /etc/sudoers. For example I tried to define, that noone on the system can use "sudo vi" with the command alias EDITORS linking to the binaries and defining
[12:29:06] <haroon> "Defaults!EDITORS noexec" at the begining. I'm pretty sure I'm missing something, because I can still use "sudo vi". I hope someone can point me in the right direction or educate me. Thanks.    http://ix.io/3qXq

[19:40:06] <BrainDamage> thunderbird works here as well
[19:40:19] <m333p> how can that be :(
[19:40:19] <wez> Generally servers should be able to be put in the bin and a new one spun up to take over or handle extra load.
[19:40:30] <NetSysFire> yeah but they need maintenance too

[19:40:57] <Namarrgon> m333p: try it with a new thunderbird profile
[19:41:01] <NetSysFire> wez: and rolling release may come with e.g regressions and stuff since you dont get security fixes backported so you need to usually update to a whole new version

[21:06:46] <fivespoons> Hi, I am using the Arch Linux ISO image, and I have made a script named 'install' (~/install).  When I tab auto-complete on this script (./install \t),  the script is called with '--version' as its argument.  Why is this happening?
