[00:13:00] <fendor[m]> ah yes, that makes sense

[06:05:58] <drsooch[m]> alanz  mpickering : is `ghc-exactprint` supposed to mirror the GHC util version of `ExactPrint`? 
[06:05:58] <drsooch[m]> Currently just trying to get it to compile, but if it makes more sense to upgrade the library directly rather than my simple hacking, I'd be happy to lend a hand doing the grunt work

[23:37:08] <maerwald> fendor[m]: can you add maerwald as member to vscode repo?
[23:37:13] <maerwald> that's my second account on github
[23:37:18] <maerwald> so I can approve my own PRs xD
[23:37:26] <fendor[m]> lol
[23:37:59] <fendor[m]> one review is enough iirc
[23:38:04] <fendor[m]> to merge, I mean
[23:38:31] <maerwald> yes, but I can't signal that I approve of my own work
[23:38:38] <fendor[m]> invited!
[23:41:08] <fendor[m]> now you can ðŸ™‚
