[04:05:19] <fizzie> Well, not *entirely* a shell convention, execlp and execvp both perform a shell-style path search and (at least from a POSIX interface perspective, if not from a real-world system-call-vs-library-wrapper one) are just as real as execve.

[04:18:06] <aquanight> fizzie: that's fair, but the point is that execve is the actual syscall/lowlevel interface. The kernel does not acknowledge PATH - that's entirely a userspace concept.
[04:18:21] <aquanight> Where that's relevant is that shebangs are a kernel function.
[04:18:39] <aquanight> and having established that the kernel doesn't know PATH, it'd need the help of something in userspace that does.
[04:18:44] <aquanight> That something, of course, is /usr/bin/env
[04:19:33] <aquanight> execlp and execvp I believe do the PATH-resolution in userspace (glibc wrapper or what have you) before passing it along to execve
[04:20:17] <aquanight> (this can even be seen when perusing the man pages, exec, execlp, execvp, etc are all section 3 (libc functions) while execve is section 2 (system calls))
[04:21:01] <aquanight> for the record, I believe perl's own exec is basically execvp
[04:21:09] <aquanight> well
[04:21:15] <aquanight> execvp in longform, exec in shortform
[04:22:24] <aquanight> hmm I guess not
[04:22:49] <aquanight> it's probably always execvp just whether or not perl splits the arguments itself or just passes the whole kit and kaboodle to "/bin/sh", "-c", $cmd;
[04:24:47] <aquanight> that said, I've considered this idea for perl shebangs:
[04:24:52] <aquanight> #!/bin/sh
[04:24:58] <aquanight> exec perl -x "$0" "$@"
[04:25:01] <aquanight> #!perl
[04:25:04] <aquanight> use v5.32; etc
[04:26:06] <aquanight> actually I can do better

[07:57:14] <Paperbot> Shlomi Fish (@shlomif) 26d18m ago: From #IRC : One thing we appreciate about #perl #CPAN, is that there is often a "category killer", which while not always perfect, is used. On PyPI and npm, many use cases have many alternatives (re https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=the-old-shareware-and-the-android-apps ; https://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/How_Alternatives_Proliferate/ ) wo a clear winner.
[07:58:38] <vanessa> yes. the golfing got me interested in perl, but now I am using it for other things as well. Like right now, I am trying out Statocles. On the surface it looks easier to extend to new functionalities than Hugo/Jekyll
[07:59:40] <rindolf> vanessa: heh, you're not getting out of life alive;]

[13:00:04] <bliako> Hi all, I am trying to write a module which uses OpenCV via XS. It seems that lots of macros and functions that Perl uses internally (e.g. in CORE/perl.h) are ermmm not unique. For example #define seed, do_open, do_close. These are common names for functions. As it happens OpenCV uses them as well. I have managed to eliminate this problem by #undef
[13:00:05] <bliako> seed etc. (obviously a bad hack). But now I got a big one: OpenCV uses namespace cv and Perl uses struct cv. Is this the end of the road?
[13:02:36] <Botje> more macros!
[13:03:17] <Botje> #define cv perl_cv; #include all the perl stuff #undef cv
[13:04:17] <xenu> if defining NO_XSLOCKS (it removes some of the worst offenders) and changing #include order doesn't help
[13:04:31] <xenu> your best bet is to put the code that calls opencv in a separate file
[13:04:55] <xenu> and call the functions defined in that file from xs

[13:49:20] <bliako> @leont the namespace cv still conflicts with perl's struct cv
[13:49:59] <leont> Then his advice of splitting up c files and xs files will be necessary
[13:51:04] <leont> It's often the better idea, specially when a dist is non-trivial
[13:51:12] <bliako> got it. One tiny problem. I need a pointer on how to use ExtUtils::MakeMaker to compile that extra C file. Is there a nice way to do that or should I resort to a postamble?

[17:02:07] <bliako> XSLoader and also Dynaloader give me a problem. The setup is from this morning: I have a C file which contains calls to OpenCV. I have XS which calls a function in the C file. This setup is so that Perl internal macros, function names,struct etc. and OpenCV's don't conflict (yes there's a lot of conflct including the name 'cv'). I have separated
[17:02:08] <bliako> OpenCV and XS as per a suggestion here (botje, xenu). That now compiles fine. However, when loading the module, Dynaloader and XSLoader both complain that a simple can not be found. OpenCV lib is dynamic and in turn it depends on libtbb which is in the LD path. But somehow it gives me missing symbols from libtbb. It can be that I messed up building
[17:02:08] <bliako> up OpenCV (but I can compile and run programs just by adding -ltbb). I don't know how to tell *Loader to give me more specifics (I set env PERL_DL_DEBUG but makes no difference). Can I tell the *Loader to load other dynamic libraries?

[19:37:22] <bliako> Botje, it worked. The problems were 2. 1) As you suggested LD_LIBRARY_PATH missed /usr/lib64. 2) g++ function name mangling!!!!!!! That was a killer. It is easily fixed by telling the g++ compiler not to do name mangling using the extern "C" { } thingy
