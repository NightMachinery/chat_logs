[00:04:39] <fweht> bomb: i  want to create some kind of 'effect' which is applied on an svg the user posts on the page from e.g. figma or adobe illustrator
[00:05:31] <pavonia> Can't you create an SVG offscreen and measure the bounding box on that?
[00:05:33] <bomb> fweht ah Paper can import/export SVG. but I did not tried that personally

It's running grasshopper (which I don't know anything about) and giving an invalid_username error, but that looks like a catchall. Is there any easy way to see the actual error being returned? https://pastebin.com/bc4YvWza

I would change the program so it terminates early on and work my way forward until the error happens and hope that knowing where it occurs helps me figure out the reason

[05:36:59] <hmw[at]> Slade: I once drove an hour to a secured data center with face recognition and all, where we had two modems connecting a local site via modems to a line back to the capital city. A Nokia tech used our power chord. Even plugged our modems back in afterwards, but forgot to flip the switch to "on".

[11:42:36] <pluri> how do I remove a listener which I added with `element.on("click", ...)` ?
[11:42:52] <pluri> will `.off("click")` work?
[11:43:33] <pluri> apparently `.off` is not a function
[11:43:59] <pluri> how do I reverse `getElementById("id").on("click", ...)` ?
[11:44:20] <Maxdamantus> What's `.on`?
[11:44:31] <pluri> it adds an event listener for the event
[11:44:39] <Maxdamantus> Are you using some library that hacks extra functions into the DOM?
[11:44:43] <pluri> nope
[11:45:07] <Maxdamantus> Then I don't think your `.on` code works.
[11:45:07] <thykka> .on is a jQuery thing
[11:45:10] <pluri> is `.on` not a standard function for a DOM element?
[11:45:11] <thykka> you can't use it with vanilla
[11:45:18] <pluri> yeah but I'm not using jQuery in this case
[11:45:22] <thykka> use .addEventListener
[11:46:08] <pluri> this fiddle uses `document.getElementById("id").on("plotly_click", ...)` : https://codepen.io/plotly/pen/QbZmZY
[11:46:22] <pluri> it doesn't use jQuery
[11:47:03] <thykka> it does
[11:47:10] <Maxdamantus> `myPlot` isn't an element.
[11:47:18] <thykka> plotly-latest.min.js contains a bunch of libraries
[11:47:19] <Maxdamantus> Oh, maybe it is.
[11:47:20] <thykka> including jq
[11:47:25] <pluri> var myPlot = document.getElementById('myDiv'),
[11:47:34] <Maxdamantus> but yes, looks like something's adding custom methods to the DOM.
[11:47:41] <thykka> it's disgusting
[11:47:57] <pluri> that's weird that they would just add a function like that
[11:48:05] <pluri> directly onto the DOM
[11:48:13] <thykka> many programmers do weird things
[11:48:31] <thykka> they don't stop to think whether they should, even if they can
[11:48:36] <pluri> so `element.on()` doesn't exist in vanilla JS?

[11:48:39] <thykka> no
[11:48:51] <pluri> oh ok
[11:49:03] <thykka> use addEventListener/removeEventListener
[11:49:16] <thykka> and you'll need to store a reference to the listener function, in order to remove it
[11:49:17] <pluri> the annoying thing is that it doesn't add `.off()`, so idk how to remove it
[11:49:33] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener
[11:49:47] <pluri> yeah, but who knows what `.on()` is, right?
[11:50:06] <pluri> it's not necessarily interchangeable with `.addEventListener`
[11:50:33] <pluri> in fact, it's not even interchangeable with jQuery's `.on()`, the `data` passed to the callback is completely different
[11:50:47] <thykka> not necessarily, but if not, it's a completely new level of stupidity :P
[11:51:06] <thykka> they'd have rolled their own event system

[11:58:45] <pluri> and it's free
[11:59:07] <thykka> using `var` everywhere, indentation in examples is a joke, using loops over array methods...

[15:14:52] <undefined_bob> okay, we got some news
[15:17:10] <undefined_bob> the devs said the error is because there are prices in the datebase which are connected with an customer ID. But this ID is (currently) not used in the shop. And now the shop software just take those prices and think they are not customer connected prices, and use them as regular prices for everyone. Which is totally lame

[18:28:33] <notchris> I see
[18:28:34] <ljharb> it's not actually wrong because it'd just be convention
[18:29:08] <notchris> Right, so it's preference in that case, but not necessarily following typical convention?
[18:29:54] <ljharb> correct, my guess is that they intended to follow existing convention, but since none exists, they accidentally made a new one

[20:20:19] <kalen> is it considered bad practice to keep test code (i.e., code that will ONLY run in a test environment) in your source files? in most cases, it's easy to avoid this. but in this particular case, i'm testing the output of a script that takes different command-line options. one of those options executes a long-running external process that i don't want to execute for my tests. so in my source, i check an environment variable to see if it's being
[20:20:19] <kalen> run by my test runner, and if so, i simply print out the shell command arguments that it WOULD have used had it actually executed the long-running process. and i just validate that those args are correct in my test
[20:20:53] <kalen> this works, but it honestly feels like code smell to keep test code in my source

[21:03:09] *** Joins: kill (~killown@user/killown)
[21:04:04] <kalen> biberu, right, but where do you configure it? right now, that's kind of what i do by checking an environment variable to see if the script was run by my test runner. and if so, the function "handles" things differently. but the idea is to somehow remove the test code from the script entirely
[21:05:01] <kalen> if (isTestRun()) { ...do this... } else { ...do normal stuff... } just seems gross
[21:05:17] <qswz> lol
[21:05:27] <qswz> test conditions should not be in your main code
[21:05:42] <kalen> okay, so what do you propose

[21:07:48] <biberu> kalen: it depends on your architecture, would might partially apply the function you're testing with, might inject something, either way your code shouldn't be aware that it's being tested
[21:07:52] <qswz> well right, you can always have some rare conditions for testing this, it's fine
[21:08:09] <efdee> kalen: use a strategy pattern. basically provide a class/an object for your program to use, default it to the actual task, but make it settable so you can replace it with a dummy in your tests

[21:10:30] <qswz> what's better: new URL(location).searchParams.get('sid') VS new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('sid')
[21:10:54] <kalen> efdee, if that settable code is in the script itself, then that's not really that much different. you're still adding code that is purely for testing purposes. i'm trying to see if there's a way to do this all outside the script itself. for example, imagine i have zero control over the script, and i'm simply adding tests for someone else's closed-source project
[21:11:24] <efdee> qswz: i guess the second one, since that doesn't require you to have a full location object available
[21:11:36] <kalen> and let's say that closed-source executable runs some long-running process. how would i stub that out or whatever
[21:11:43] <kalen> as i test it
[21:11:45] <qswz> hm right, but window.location is alway there
[21:11:46] <efdee> kalen: sure it's much different. it's called inversion of control, and it's totally different from "having your code check an environment variable to see if they're being tested"
[21:12:11] <qswz> #2 has 2 "search"

[22:08:31] <node1> I'm talking about `javascript engine` does not it translate the code into 0 & 1 ?
[22:09:53] <samsch> node1, Firefox uses the Spidermonkey JS engine: https://spidermonkey.dev/
[22:10:39] <samsch> Within your normal builds of Firefox there isn't a view into the runtime process itself that you could inspect.
[22:12:15] <node1> samsch Can i view this  `Spidermonkey JS` in my local browser?
[22:12:42] <efdee> what do you expect to see?
[22:12:50] <qswz> a monkey
[22:12:59] * efdee holds up a mirror
[22:13:10] <systemfault> qswz: What about the spider though?
[22:13:12] <samsch> node1, no
[22:13:21] <qswz> they have eaten it
[22:13:26] <stenno> return to moke
[22:13:44] <stenno> reject humanity, return to monke
[22:13:59] <samsch> Like I said, there's no view into the runtime process in your browser. The only way to have that would be a debug build of Firefox itself, like any other binary software.
[22:14:36] <samsch> node1, But what is your goal, what are you trying to do?
[22:15:13] <qswz> trying to get a nobel
[22:15:52] <ljharb> node1: there is no one "js engine"
[22:16:00] <ljharb> node1: and no, you can't view the code for your browser in your browser

[22:16:57] <systemfault> It's only a matter of time before Apple says "fuck it" and abandon webkit/jscore... and a few years before Mozilla dies</troll>

[22:17:26] <systemfault> ljharb: I didn't believe MS would do it...
[22:17:32] <ljharb> MS doesn't own a mobile platform
[22:17:39] <ljharb> if windows phone didn't fail then MS wouldn't have done it either
[22:18:22] <systemfault> Okay... so Apple has no problem changing CPU architecture every decade... but changing browser is simply impossible.
[22:18:26] <systemfault> Makes sense.
[22:19:30] <ljharb> it makes perfect sense. apple pay is tied to jsc
[22:20:08] <ljharb> and the reason they changed CPU architecture the second time (it's only happened twice, so NOT every decade) is because of the iPhone
[22:20:09] <samsch> MS had already lost all it's users, and no longer had an any kind of edge. Their competition already won, so might as well mooch.

[22:21:14] *** Joins: Tabstar (~tabmow@user/tabmow)
[22:21:19] <ljharb> Apple is paranoid about someone else controlling their destiny. it's why they have more money hoarded than google many times over, and it's why they would literally *never* cede control of the browser on their own platforms to google.
[22:21:36] <ljharb> Apple would sooner go out of business than cede control.
