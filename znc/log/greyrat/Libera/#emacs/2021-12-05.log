[03:23:19] <junebug> Speaking of bell. Is there a way to get emacs to play a sounds when an item scheduled on your agenda has is due?
[03:23:37] <Defsubst> depends on your agendaa
[03:23:50] <Defsubst> yours connect to google?
[03:23:50] <junebug> I'm using default org mode agenda
[03:23:54] <Defsubst> ah
[03:24:21] <Defsubst> my phisolophy is: when it's due, it's due
[03:24:29] <Defsubst> like android phones they don't warn after it's due
[03:24:35] <Defsubst> you skip meetings and it is fine :)
[03:24:45] <junebug> But that gives me an idea. Maybe I can hook into the schedule function and schedule a reminder on my phone remotely
[03:25:03] <Defsubst> junebug even if no hooks provided advice is your friend
[03:25:10] <Defsubst> or just plain redefining a core function
[03:25:12] <Defsubst> it does work
[03:25:28] <junebug> I'll give that a shot. Thanks!
[03:26:10] <Defsubst> i mean "core function" emacs knows nothing about that
[03:26:17] <Defsubst> it just has a symbol table
[03:26:36] <Defsubst> you can do all sort of stuff with it, it will not care

[03:29:40] <Defsubst> &key
[03:29:46] <Defsubst> you mean &key ?
[03:29:57] <Defsubst> it is basically an assoc list of keys
[03:30:14] <the_tubular> I have no clue what &key is
[03:30:28] <Defsubst> it is for providing keyed arguments to a function
[03:30:39] <Defsubst> and guess what under the hood it is real slow :)
[03:31:10] <Defsubst> basically it looks up the argument by name into a hash table (or so i hope) or into a alist
[03:31:19] <GNUHacker> wut do u want? put ur emacs conf in org mode?
[03:31:39] <Defsubst> lol
[03:31:44] <Defsubst> good question
[03:31:55] <the_tubular> Not emacs config, but a program that has a config file not written in any specific language
[03:32:12] <the_tubular> Let's say like the sudoers file
[03:32:12] <Defsubst> hooks then?
[03:32:16] <Defsubst> yeah 
[03:32:22] <Defsubst> good idea to use emacs with visudo
[03:32:23] <Defsubst> haha
[03:32:34] <GNUHacker> huh?
[03:32:34] <Defsubst> '(in emacs we trust)
[03:33:02] <Defsubst> ok so the answer is fairly simple
[03:33:11] <Defsubst> if you wanna edit the sudoers you use visudo
[03:33:30] <the_tubular> sudoers was an exemple
[03:33:33] <Defsubst> ok
[03:33:41] <Defsubst> EDITOR env var
[03:33:44] <Defsubst> i mean visudo uses that
[03:33:53] <Defsubst> that's the point of visudo
[03:33:57] <the_tubular> That's not what my question was
[03:33:59] <Defsubst> it doesn't invoke the editor as root
[03:34:01] <Defsubst> ok sry

[04:23:19] <edrx> so: I was giving a mini-workshop on eev this evening and bandali was there, and he was getting some strange bugs. it *seems* that they are related to a feature implemented on recent emacsen that tries to do the right thing when we try to run a function that is not defined and doesn't have an autoload - the feature tries to load the file in the load-path in which that that function seems to be defined.
[04:23:31] <zebrag> bremner: did you pull it from github? It's the current version on github, the version I have now is f851e725b35d2ebd. Maybe I could checkout "emacs-28"

[06:35:49] <edrx> nice!!!!
[06:35:55] <Defsubst> that's the entire point of the GNU system
[06:36:00] <Defsubst> automating stuff!
[06:36:11] <dt0> edrx: basically my approach is to help the learner do it themselves, with guidance... instead of demoing things for them 
[06:36:12] <edrx> it's the opposite of my approach
[06:36:29] <Defsubst> my approach is that learners need to rtfs
[06:36:44] <edrx> I mean, I show where the executable notes are and help the people use them
[06:36:49] <Defsubst> the only essence of life is the source code
[06:36:51] <dt0> well my approach to language learning is through immersion i guess
[06:37:00] <dt0> although i am monolingual IRL lol
[06:37:18] <Defsubst> dont be worried i am worse
[06:38:04] <homerj> immersion is the only way to learn a language...I mean, you can't really learn a new way of communicating and not accutally communicate
[06:38:10] <homerj> it's like learning how to drive by a book
[06:38:19] <Defsubst> depends on the language
[06:38:27] <dt0> with Lisp you have to get used to typing parens, etc
[06:38:33] <dt0> so i got her started typing them ASAP
[06:38:34] <Defsubst> i have projects for immersing, as you put it into Norway
[06:38:48] <Defsubst> lisp is for serial killers
[06:39:12] <homerj> lisp is just one of those things where it's not great, but it's far from the worst
[06:39:19] <dt0> instead of telling her, "open a left parenthesis", after a few times i could just say "and now open a new list" or "now another function call" and then she could close them on her own etc
[06:39:39] <Defsubst> lo

[06:39:55] <Defsubst> it is terrible
[06:39:59] <dt0> teaching lisp is hard
[06:40:01] <Defsubst> any language is better
[06:40:09] <Defsubst> it is frigging easy
[06:40:18] <Defsubst> it was designed in 1958
[06:40:33] <edrx> one of the videos that I recorded for today's workshop was a demo of how I usually "save elisp hyperlinks to all the interesting things that I find"... in real life I do that much faster than I do in the video, as I don't have to explain what I am doing... and I recommended this for the people who would like to watch it:

[06:40:59] <dt0> i was teaching basics of CL to a friend recently, and we ran into the distinction between variable names and function names. it was tricky to explain why #' is needed
[06:41:17] <Defsubst> dt0 even common lisp is not standard
[06:41:39] <Defsubst> it is needed coz a lisp "compiler" is retarded
[06:41:49] <Defsubst> it doesnt know what's in a list
[06:41:57] <Defsubst> it doesn't go into it
[06:42:14] <Defsubst> but the # optimization is debatable

[06:42:47] <dt0> #' isn't an optimization, it's a synonym for FUNCTION

[10:39:34] <AndrewYu> I am in search for a minor mode that keeps the cursor in the middle of the window while moving, i.e., moves the view rather than the cursor even if there are enough on-screen lines for the cursor to move in
[10:40:03] <AndrewYu> I am searching MELPA and ELPA, no results yet, tring to get a good search term

[10:42:31] <AndrewYu> center-cursor-mode is on my list rn-
[10:43:54] <AndrewYu> scroll-lock-mode might also be it
[10:46:09] <wkmanire> AndrewYu: Is this a personal preference or is it part of a larger problem? Such as something that is impacting your work flow (inability to see the text you need to cross-reference while you're working for example)

[10:48:07] *** Joins: treflip (~user@95.79.32.99)
[10:48:48] <edrx> AndrewYu: you can get a good part of what you want by using the scroll lock key to toggle scroll-lock-mode on and off and using C-l to recenter...

[10:50:30] <AndrewYu> Yeah. But that's too manual, and I'd need to reprogram the keyboard for scrolllock---it makes more sense to be automatic
[10:51:05] <wkmanire> AndrewYu: That seems highly specific. It probably wouldn't be too hard to write as a minor mode.
[10:51:54] <wkmanire> From personal experience, I rarely open three splits on the same buffer (maybe never?). At most it's been two, and for the same reason you specify
[10:52:09] <wkmanire> Only that I switch to the "reference" split and search to the thing I want to reference
[10:52:15] <wkmanire> then switch back to the "working" split. If that makes sense
[10:52:37] <wkmanire> It sounds like what you want is a kind of vertical wrapping centered on the middle center of your middle split.

[10:58:34] <wkmanire> ivanbu: #emacs is not a Directory
[10:58:35] <AndrewYu> Yup- I noticed that using follow-mode plus centered-cursor-mode works as I want. I'll keep a mind on conflicts. Thanks for the suggestions!
[10:58:42] <AndrewYu> xD
[10:59:20] <AndrewYu> You should be using eshell and erc instead, which are buffers, not terminals (that is, idealy)
[11:03:18] <AndrewYu> a minor problem with the follow-mode setup is that on a UHD screen, my computer from 2010 isn't powerful enough to handle that

[14:30:34] <wasamasa> I'd check whether gentoo has a service file for emacs
[14:31:32] <tschilptschilp23> Hi! I just ran into a rather strange emacs behaviour with 'ido-everywhere' set to 't'.  It heavily interfered with C-x C-f FILE.  Basically finding the file (I'm talking about ~/.emacs, but true for any -- at least dot-file) with tab-completion did not work at all, and when typing it out and hitting RET it brought me to the suggestions '~/pictures/' (german though [~/Bilder])!   At first I thought the culprit is global-company-mode set
[14:31:32] <tschilptschilp23> to 't' , or some lines set by emacs-guix and emacs-geiser, that I didn't write manually myself. But no, it was ido-everywhere. I do have a very clean init file now :)  I've had this issue two years or so ago, but became brave and enabled it again a while ago.  Probably I will again at some point, but only after I found a proper reason. Any idea, what that could be, or which benefit one can get from this setting (sorry for the implicit
[14:31:32] <tschilptschilp23> rant)?

[16:45:36] <tschilptschilp23> i don't have a clue what that should mean, but it sounds funny
[16:46:07] <yeti> er-lasser ... someone going pale
[16:46:25] <tschilptschilp23> then its 'erblassen'
[16:46:26] <yeti> erb-lasser ... someone leaving a legacy?
[16:46:43] <yeti> erblasser is the person
[16:46:50] <tschilptschilp23> hahahah
[16:46:58] <pjb> s-liao: that's because emacs doesn't have a character data type.
[16:47:13] <pjb> s-liao: (= ?a 97) --> t #| --> t |#   ?a is just another notation for 97.
[16:47:23] <tschilptschilp23> you certainly can say it, but better suited for poems
[16:47:51] <pjb> s-liao: the correct usage is: (and (=  (decode-char 'ascii ?a) 97)   (= (encode-char 97 'ascii) ?a))
[16:48:02] <yeti> but even if not against ambiguities.... having syllable hints in our long words sure would help a lot on many cases
[16:48:12] <pjb> but since ?a and 97 are the same, decode-char 'ascii and encode-char 'ascii are just identity.
[16:48:15] <resistfascism> @tbremner - the precise absolutely crystal clear shining like a diamond error message is everything after and including "IMPORTANT"in my previous message, @tyson2 thank you for your excellent response, it seems my issue was I had two org-202109* directories in my .emacs.d/elpa/ directory.  I was only removing one of them, I deleted both and another org mode bullets directory in .emacs.d/elpa and after that the error message 
[16:48:15] <resistfascism> (that I quoted precisely @bremner) went away.

[21:53:17] <ruediger> I have some code in my init.el that does (dolist (mode modes) (add-hook (...) (lexical-let ((mode mode)) (lambda () (diminish mode))))).  But it seems like lexical-let is no longer supported.  I have lexical-binding: t in my init.el. But if I change the lexical-let to a let I still get errors about mode being void when the hook gets called.  What am I doing wrong?
