[12:18:33] <T`aZ> you cant explain that
[12:18:41] <T`aZ> s/back/bag/
[12:19:19] <Crocodillian> there are some cases
[12:19:25] <Crocodillian> one sec
[12:19:29] <T`aZ> s/lire/lie/
[12:19:39] <T`aZ> need more coffee
[12:20:34] <Crocodillian> try this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GJNWULS/
[12:22:30] <T`aZ> mmmm
[12:22:45] <Crocodillian> it takes a few seconds to wind
[12:22:48] <T`aZ> they all look too happy when using the cable

[12:23:11] <Crocodillian> you can just roll them up and use a twist-tie
[12:23:23] <T`aZ> but how does it stay rulled
[12:23:25] <T`aZ> rolled*
[12:23:38] <Crocodillian> you tie the twist tie across the circle
[12:24:33] <T`aZ> ha yeah now i see
[12:24:40] <Crocodillian> I also tied a twist tie across my right cable so that I don't have to keep figuring that out
[12:24:58] <Crocodillian> highly recommend that
[12:25:38] <Crocodillian> you make like a little ball across the middle of the right cable then you know instantly which one it is
[12:28:07] <Crocodillian> you can use a piece of tape for that or whatever too
[12:31:20] <Crocodillian> I just took the sim card out of my phone
[12:31:36] <Crocodillian> it has 70 tunnel trance force cds and solitaire, all I need
[12:32:34] <Crocodillian> I know the bill collectors care about me, but I'd prefer not to talk to them
[12:33:46] <Crocodillian> we have an important business to discuss with you
[12:36:31] <T`aZ> should not have bought so many stuff on amazon
[12:37:09] <T`aZ> i might try that thing Crocodillian so thx :p
[12:38:41] <Crocodillian> they also have these "gear ties" like twist ties but much thicker

[13:25:57] <dukwon> i pulled all the muscles in my back while taking my shoes off the other day
[13:35:36] <T`aZ> bunch of grand pas
[13:37:05] <Svitkona> i actually used to have worse back pain at ~18 than i do now
[13:37:13] <Svitkona> i guess it's because the chairs at school were horrible
[13:37:43] <Svitkona> sitting all day probably isn't good but at least i do it in an office chair now
[13:39:17] <Renderwww> should have gotten a job as a coal miner. It's very healthy because you get physical exercise during work on a daily basis
[13:41:02] <Svitkona> we only have a single coal mine in the country where i grew up
