[03:49:52] * BitcoinCobra punches luke-jr in the belly
[03:52:03] <s17> nobody was asking about Blockstream
[03:52:09] <s17> and you've talked about it enough already
[03:52:28] <BitcoinCobra> "Blockstream is a hostile actor in the space. They don't want Bitcoin to succeed."
[03:52:42] <BitcoinCobra> "The worst thing Blockstream has done: they made a block size increase on Bitcoin absolutely impossible. They whipped up a mob to such an extent that, for the foreseeable decade, we're not going to get any increase because a mass of uneducated morons will oppose it."
[03:53:00] <BitcoinCobra> "Before Blockstream, the general consensus was that hard forks could be done in the future, carefully and far ahead in advance. They ripped that consensus out of the community. Any Bitcoiner who doesn't view Blockstream with some level of suspicion has no intellect; you don't need to call them a fucking conspiracy, but you better raise a bloody eyebrow when there exists a company that benefits from Bitcoin not working."

[20:34:41] <AndyS2_> I guess mined blocks of that node wouldn't propagate, either, so potential mining losses.

[21:00:21] <testusr> while: it really depends by scenarios. Social groups are formed (generally) to take advantage of human cooperation, and lying is allowed only at some extent (in particular, the ones that don't affect to much the results of the cooperative efforts)
[21:01:52] <Diablo-D3> while: in the sense of fast and slow thinking, yes, I'd certainly lean on the fast branch and assume it isn't an orchestrated attack suddenly out of nowhere
[21:01:55] <while> committees can be used in the same way, take advantage of a presence or lack of human co-operation in meeting a common objective, my favorite would probably be the International Business Company entities

[23:49:04] <Aut0Exec> hi
[23:49:15] <Aut0Exec> need help getting started
[23:49:24] <Aut0Exec> where to sign up for bitcoin quickly to begin purchasing
[23:49:26] <Aut0Exec> ?
[23:49:49] <m17h> Several places you can purchase it
[23:49:52] *** Joins: fleitner (~fleitner@131.100.62.139)
[23:49:55] <m17h> Depends on how you want to buy it
[23:50:13] <Aut0Exec> what do you mean?
[23:50:16] <m17h> BitForex, LocalBitcoins, and obviously the most popular and also most hated Coinbase
[23:50:28] <m17h> And there are many others as well
[23:50:31] <m17h> Gemini
[23:50:33] <Aut0Exec> m17h: which one is best ?
[23:50:48] <linux_dream> use coinbase pro instead of coinbase if gonna be using coinbase at all
[23:50:57] <linux_dream> much smaller fees
[23:51:11] <m17h> Honestly it depends but LocalBitcoins allows you to buy directly from other users and one time I got scammed using it but the service from the website was so good that they took care of it for me
[23:51:15] <m17h> Just took longer
[23:51:19] *** Quits: fleitner_ (~fleitner@2804:828:f232:aa7c:e7c7:afcc:c10c:d10c) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:51:25] <m17h> Coinbase is easier and faster but there are more fees
[23:51:33] <Aut0Exec> m17h: ok I'll will look into localbitcoins
[23:51:33] <m17h> I like BitForex a lot for trading though
[23:51:46] <Aut0Exec> will I Need a wallet?
[23:51:50] <m17h> BitForex is a real nice one if you take the time to learn it
[23:51:58] <m17h> Having your own wallet is a good thing
[23:52:07] <m17h> I highly recommend having one
[23:52:17] <m17h> But you can store them on Coinbase and BitForex as well
[23:52:35] <Aut0Exec> where to get a wallet?
[23:53:01] <Aut0Exec> so many questions... I'm sorry
[23:53:03] <Aut0Exec> :(
[23:53:04] <m17h> Depends on your platform
[23:53:13] <m17h> Don't apologize! That's what this is for
[23:53:27] <Aut0Exec> ok cool
[23:53:30] <Aut0Exec> :)
[23:53:30] <m17h> If you're on PC, there are lots of choices but I use Electrum
[23:53:44] <Aut0Exec> I can sign up for a wallet with Electrum?
[23:54:00] <m17h> For mobile, I use BitPay now bc I can convert it to cash instantly that I can spend with my BitPay debit card.
[23:54:08] <m17h> No need to sign up for anything with Electrum
[23:54:09] <Aut0Exec> k
[23:54:12] <m17h> Just download and go :)
[23:54:22] <m17h> You will need to save your keys though
[23:54:29] <m17h> That is very important
[23:54:31] <Aut0Exec> kk
[23:55:09] <Aut0Exec> should I wait for the next dip or is now still a good time to buy bitcoin?
[23:55:26] <Aut0Exec> last question
[23:55:34] <m17h> It depends on who you ask but my answer is that there is never a bad time to buy
[23:55:46] <Aut0Exec> k
[23:55:49] <m17h> If you look at all the data of BTC and you start to understand how it works, you can see where its going
[23:55:58] <m17h> And it really start to show that anytime is the right time
[23:56:07] <m17h> Maybe not for the short term but definitely for the long term
[23:56:09] <Aut0Exec> ok good to know
[23:56:11] <Aut0Exec> :)
[23:56:41] <m17h> If you had bought into BTC at ANY point in the last 11 years you would be well off yet there were hundreds of times where people thought Bitcoin was dying off and it never did
[23:56:57] <m17h> It will always fall a lot and the trick is to not freak out and just use it as an opportunity to buy more
[23:57:13] <m17h> That's what I did in this last dip from $60k to $30k and now its back to $60k
[23:57:39] <Aut0Exec> oh nice
[23:57:46] <m17h> Everyone that understands BTC well believes the price is sure to increase tenfold if not more over the long term
[23:58:02] <m17h> Every four years we get less supply which only increases the price more
[23:58:19] <m17h> Okay I gotta head off of here but I'll be back later if you have any other questions
[23:58:25] <m17h> I'm sure other people can help out too
[23:58:29] <Aut0Exec> m17h: thank you so much man...
[23:58:32] <Aut0Exec> appreciate it
[23:58:35] <Aut0Exec> :)
[23:58:40] <m17h> Yeah man no worries! I'm glad I could offer you some insight
[23:59:01] <linux_dream> i dont see how rewards halving implies the price skyrockets
[23:59:03] <m17h> Good luck to you and I hope you make the best of it! BTC is an awesome thing to get into so I'm glad you're with us :)
[23:59:13] <Aut0Exec> m17h:thanks man
[23:59:18] <linux_dream> out of 21 million BTC, about 18 million BTC is already distributed
[23:59:19] <Aut0Exec> I'll be sticking around
[23:59:42] <Aut0Exec> linux_dream: so when it reaches 21 million what will happen to the people who have coin?
[23:59:52] <linux_dream> what will dictate the price is how it gets adopted/bought, mostly, now.  if anything, mining decreases its price
