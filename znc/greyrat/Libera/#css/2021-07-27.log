[00:11:54] <pavonia> Probably because another element overlaps it

[00:19:09] <hassoon> craigbass76: see what event.target gives you
[00:20:20] <hassoon> craigbass76: and..you might want to apply the css pointer-events:none; on the element overlapping your button/link
[00:20:31] <hassoon> most likely a span pr whatever
[00:20:36] <hassoon> * or *
[00:21:31] <craigbass76> I gave the div in question a z-index of 2, and it's fixed. I'm going back over stuff though because I don't want to use duct tape if I don't have to.

[00:33:55] <craigbass76> getStartedTop -- line 71. I have the zindex to pageTitle a few lines above and it's working
[00:36:13] <hassoon> i don't understand
[00:36:26] <hassoon> show me your element that you want to make perfectly clickable
[00:36:42] <hassoon> just the element, using a CSS selector
[00:37:55] <hassoon> and you better avoid using positioned elements, especially for a mere button, navbars are mostly likely the ones that need positioning
[00:38:09] <craigbass76> #getStartedTop a
[00:38:42] <craigbass76> I think I needed the positioning in order to do the glass look
[00:40:22] <hassoon> craigbass76: your a element clicks perfectly
[00:40:25] <hassoon> what's wrong
[00:43:47] <hassoon> craigbass76: whatever you're up to, your <a> element is clickable, try clicking on it and it will become red framed
[00:43:50] <hassoon> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/346
[00:50:40] <craigbass76> hassoon: right, it does now that I'd changed the z-index.
[00:50:59] <craigbass76> I was curious as to what was discombobulated initially.
[00:51:08] <craigbass76> That seems like a hack, but maybe it's a fix.
[00:53:04] <hassoon> i don't see a z-index at all
[00:53:28] <craigbass76> line 63 in the css (pageTitle div)
[00:54:24] <craigbass76> Oh, in the first one I posted. I don't see one in what you posted.
[01:00:19] <hassoon> there is no libe 63 in yourfiddle
[01:00:45] <craigbass76> And I accidentally did a hard refresh (thought I was looking at my own page) so it's gone.
[01:01:35] <hassoon> you don't need a pseudo element to produce that glass effect
[01:01:57] <hassoon> you just need to use gradient coloration efficiently

[04:07:15] <epolanski> what does that mean?
[04:07:38] <epolanski> the second part, "a size of 1 px unit per image source pixel must be assumed."
[04:10:13] <entuland> where did you pick that one up?
[04:13:56] <entuland> I can tell they refer to resolution as in pixel-per-inch or something, but that only matters when printing or when you care about the "real world" dimensions so to speak - when you're displaying it on a screen displaying one destination pixel per source pixel is pretty much the norm
[04:15:02] <epolanski> entuland: intrinsic dimentions definition here
[04:15:03] <epolanski> https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#defs
[04:17:27] <entuland> I see
[04:17:58] <entuland> there may be something in some raster images that CSS is able to detect if you don't specify any dimensions, to decide how to render it on screen or on print or something
[04:19:03] <entuland> css or html
[04:19:15] <entuland> but in the end images should pretty much always have an explicitly set width and height in the markup
[04:19:35] <entuland> I wouldn't rely on that document anyways either, since it's obsolete

[06:37:06] <Rockwood> now i am trying to understand
[06:37:31] <FunkyBob> in any URL you can target an ID by using the fragment... #foo <-- fragment for foo
[06:38:00] <FunkyBob> so inside the page, you can have <a href="#foo">  ... and lcicking that takes you to the element with id="foo" within the page

[06:41:58] <Rockwood> oh okay
[06:42:04] <Rockwood> now i got it
[06:44:24] <Rockwood> but controlling by button
[06:45:45] <FunkyBob> ?
[06:46:44] <Rockwood> hmm
[06:46:53] <Rockwood> thinking ....
[06:47:02] <Rockwood> thinking....
[06:48:14] <Rockwood> the problem is
[06:48:37] <Rockwood> items will be generates by json
[06:49:09] <Rockwood> and if we are going to create anything by hard coding it won't works i think
[06:49:27] <FunkyBob> so don't
[06:49:27] <Rockwood> my concern is this now
[06:49:35] <Rockwood> then?
[06:49:37] <FunkyBob> if it's react, you already have a key= right?
[06:50:01] <Rockwood> okay
[06:50:04] <Rockwood> yes
[06:50:42] <Rockwood> i am confuse
[06:50:50] <Rockwood> highly confuse
[06:51:06] <FunkyBob> about?
[06:51:16] <Rockwood> we just moved on js
[06:51:20] <Rockwood> from css
[06:51:33] <Rockwood> <FunkyBob> if it's react, you already have a key= right?
[06:51:42] <Rockwood> so css roll end up here?
[06:52:01] <FunkyBob> what?
[06:52:26] <FunkyBob> when you render a list of things in React, it wants you to provide a key for each item so when it re-renders it can work out when an item already exists, and avoid re-rendering it
[06:53:06] <FunkyBob> you could use the same key to help generate IDs
[06:53:41] <Rockwood> okay
[06:54:40] <Rockwood> so i don't need make <a> for next and previous
[06:54:46] <Rockwood> so i don't need to make <a> for next and previous
[06:55:13] <FunkyBob> you wanted next/prev ?
[06:55:25] <Rockwood> 2 sec i am showing you modified
[06:55:28] <Rockwood> example
[06:55:44] <Rockwood> it will be better in understand my concept
[06:55:48] <Rockwood> just 2 sec
[06:56:24] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/react-horizontal-scrolling-menu-forked-mib4p?file=/src/index.js
[06:56:31] <Rockwood> similar like this
[06:56:52] <FunkyBob> so  you want the < and > buttons?
[06:56:56] <FunkyBob> not the "go to item X" button?
[06:56:57] <Rockwood> yes
[06:59:07] <Rockwood> FunkyBob> so  you want the < and > buttons? < i wanna do
[06:59:59] <FunkyBob> ok, well, _that_ probably does require JS
[07:00:53] <FunkyBob> to make it portable, you'd probably need to ask the DOM for the width of the container, then set the scroll offset accordingly
[07:01:52] <Rockwood> ok
[07:02:45] <Rockwood> what do you say? use readymade thing or create own?
[07:03:52] <FunkyBob> if it's for work, use ready made
[07:03:57] <FunkyBob> if it's for learning, do it y ourself
[07:05:25] <Rockwood> right now i am reading the plugin
[07:05:57] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, which is good to adopt?
[07:09:31] <FunkyBob> no idea... I know MUI has a built in tab bar with that sort of function
[07:32:48] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollLeft nice way for control
[07:40:25] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, a basic i have created --> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/VwbQLVp
[07:41:17] <Rockwood> i think no need extra
[07:41:23] <Rockwood> its fine way
[07:41:42] <Rockwood> just make style and its works for me
[07:41:46] <FunkyBob> sure
[07:41:59] <Rockwood> looks easy and nice way
[07:42:00] <FunkyBob> you could change the amount it scrolls based on the screen width of the elemtn
[07:42:07] <Rockwood> yes
[07:43:00] <Rockwood> one mint i am going to do styling in it
[07:43:47] <Rockwood> for do mouse wheel scrolling what should be do in it?

[15:02:59] <FunkyBob> em / ex / ch and their relatives are scaled by the current font size [or the root font size for rem]
[15:03:12] <FunkyBob> px is, ostensibly, the pixel size..
[15:03:31] <FunkyBob> by defining relative to your font size you make it easier to rescale everything at once

[15:13:12] <FightingFalcon> yes
[15:13:27] <FightingFalcon> but very very few people change their font size in browsers?

[22:08:46] <theseb> https://cbp-invnt-rl.uc.r.appspot.com  <---- How come the dropdown and textbox in upper left look different on chrome vs. edge?
[22:12:27] <entuland> because they're os/useragent dependent, all of those widgets are so
[22:13:01] <entuland> if you need them to "somewhat" look similar, you can try and add styling, but they'll likely end up slightly different anyways
[22:14:29] <theseb> entuland: i'm using plotly/dash library....why didn't they make it look same on all browsers? wouldn't that make most sense?
[22:20:13] <entuland> not really
[22:20:21] <entuland> it's subjective
[22:20:35] <entuland> there is something about "native look and feel" which you have to decide about
[22:21:06] <entuland> if you want you can style the hell out of any element, also completely replace it (say, bootstrap dropdowns, jquery UI and the alike)
[22:21:39] <entuland> some things are presented in a completely different manner in certain cases
[22:21:55] <entuland> say, dropdowns on iOS could not show a dropdown at all
[22:22:15] <entuland> but instead show a native overlay on the device with a list of options to pick from
[22:23:08] <entuland> same goes for datetime-local inputs, number inputs and so forth
[22:24:35] <entuland> just a random pic I found, but I know it's been like that sometimes in the past, nowadays it may just look somewhat different, but it's definitely not a traditional dropdown as the ones we get on desktop: https://d37wxxhohlp07s.cloudfront.net/s3_images/720915/Screen%20shot%202012-04-02%20at%2011.55.38%20AM.png?1333396777
