[00:35:37] <alystair> I'm wondering why this doesn't work: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/dark.css" media="prefers-color-scheme:dark">
[00:37:05] <stenno> because something is wrong
[00:37:05] *** Joins: lechner (~lechner@debian/lechner)
[00:37:57] <matsaman> alystair: try with media attribute value within parentheses
[00:38:09] <alystair> well I assumed the media attribute would work as it would within CSS @media (prefers-color-scheme:dark), except allow me to only deliver CSS that is actually used by the client...
[00:38:10] <stenno> shouldn't make a change
[00:38:11] <matsaman> but making different color schemes is honestly silly
[00:38:20] <matsaman> it's an end-user problem, the solution must be entirely end user
[00:38:32] <matsaman> stenno: lots of things "shouldn't" make a change =P
[00:38:47] <stenno> in this case, it doesn't
[00:39:00] <alystair> ok then what if it were media="prefers-reduced-motion" for accessibility
[00:39:05] <matsaman> could be, but it's worth a try
[00:39:08] <alystair> the reason for doing so isn't the point
[00:39:13] <alystair> the point is that this doesn't actually work lol
[00:39:17] <matsaman> for accessibility, CSS should be largely irrelevant
[00:39:19] <alystair> it just downloads all the CSS anyway

[00:40:36] <matsaman> it's a waste of time even if it doesn't download more CSS than you'd prefer
[00:41:01] <matsaman> end users can enforce whatever color scheme they want on their own
[00:41:06] <matsaman> they don't need and likely don't want your help
[00:41:17] <alystair> the rationale is irrelevant here
[00:41:36] <matsaman> you just want to know how to make the dark color scheme load?
[00:42:58] <alystair> actually I'm starting to think this is an HTML spec thing I need to look up
[00:43:36] <alystair> and it'll grab all assets even if they aren't necessary at initial render (Such as print)
[00:44:33] <alystair> I already have a dark theme implemented, just was curious if browsers were smart enough to only grab stylesheets relevant to initial render

[00:51:07] <alystair> also since Roboto isn't installed by default on some devices you might want to provide it (Google Font CDN or otherwise)
[00:53:54] <lechner> thanks, i originally loaded the fonts from Google, but there was some backlash. I also got a lot of requests for extra whitespace for those text browsers!
[00:54:33] <alystair> depending on the the font's license you could simply host a local copy :)

[01:05:49] <hemstock> If I replace the * with div it works
[01:05:57] <matsaman> yup, valid
[01:06:02] <matsaman> .main > :hover would also be
[01:06:08] <matsaman> although I prefer the more explicit * myself

[01:08:26] <hemstock> 1sec
[01:13:00] <hemstock> https://jsfiddle.net/71mnLatw/1/
[01:13:08] <hemstock> this doesnt work in firefox
[01:16:04] <hemstock> hm... I was missing the <!DOCTYPE html> on top of the html. Without it it didn't work. Bizzare
[01:16:24] <matsaman> mmm, yeah a lot of pastebins like jsfiddle give one the false sense that their HTML is correct
[01:16:34] <matsaman> by omitting doctype declarations from the HTML view, but silently including it
[01:16:49] <matsaman> it is required for useful HTML (but needn't be capitalized)
[01:17:31] <nbjoerg> omitting doctype will often put you in a legacy render mode
[01:18:04] <hemstock> thanks
[01:18:12] <hemstock> Learning someting new every day
[01:18:24] <hemstock> emmet autocomplete didn't add it btw
[01:19:47] <hemstock> should be using ! instead of doc
[01:29:59] <alystair> hrm I pulled all my dark theme css into a separate file but it doesn't seem to apply it /w media="prefers-color-scheme:dark"
[01:30:48] <stenno> markup without doctype will put you in quirks mode
[01:32:09] <matsaman> alystair: did you try with parentheses?
[01:32:45] <alystair> <3
[01:32:49] <alystair> perfect
[01:33:06] <alystair> TIL you need parans around attributes with values
[01:35:52] <eXtr3m0> in the w3c draft documentation they always include the parentheses https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-color-scheme
[01:36:21] <alystair> RTFM++ :D
[01:37:00] <alystair> I wish MDN got additional support it makes life so much easier trying to look these things up.. I'm too lazy to review specs directly
[01:37:06] <alystair> (most of the time)
[01:39:58] <stenno> whatwg specs is very easy to read
[01:40:08] <stenno> i recommend it as primary source
[01:40:26] <matsaman> stenno: ^
[01:40:36] <stenno> hm?
[01:41:05] <stenno> anyway, https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
[01:41:21] <stenno> whatwg is the defacto maintainer of html standard, not w3c
[01:41:24] <stenno> its complicated
[01:41:35] <stenno> but whatwg specs are the 'correct' ones
[01:42:04] <alystair> w3c is the dinosaur that turned into the fuel for whatwg's engine? :D
[01:42:17] <stenno> something like that, yeah
[01:42:19] <matsaman> stenno: you didn't say parens were irrelevant?
[01:42:43] <stenno> i mixed up parentheses with quotation marks, sorry
[01:42:59] <matsaman> just wanted you to know, no apology required =)
[01:43:04] <alystair> now to apply a transition to all elements temporarily during the switch between light/dark :D
[01:43:12] <eXtr3m0> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#standard-metadata-names:attr-meta-media-2

[01:43:30] <alystair> are any of you contributors to the spec?
[01:43:45] <matsaman> not I
[01:43:46] <stenno> i am not
