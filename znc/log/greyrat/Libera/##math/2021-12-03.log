[00:00:41] <johnkeats6> the theorem is that a rank k subbundle of TM is an integrable distribution iff for any sections X, Y of the subbundle [X, Y] is also in the subbundle
[00:00:55] <johnkeats6> this is trivial in rank 1 since [,] becomes 0 there
[00:00:57] <isekaijin> Yeah, Frobenius' theeorem.

[00:01:16] <johnkeats6> right that's the name i couldnt remember
[00:01:20] <Z-module> riv, not really weird at all: the map "mulitply on the left by (1 2)" injectively sends {all the even perms} -> {all the odd perms}  and the same map works in the other direction, so that map is actually a bijection.

[00:07:01] <johnkeats6> depends on your definition of 'algebraic', but you're not gonna get away without some kind of differentiation
[00:07:21] <johnkeats6> the definition using forms requires you to take an exterior derivative
[00:08:04] <johnkeats6> ker w is an integrable distribution if w /\ dw = 0, iirc

[00:11:18] <isekaijin> Differentials are okay, they can be defined purely algebraically.
[00:11:23] <johnkeats6> there's a deep generalization of this to the problem of integrability of G-structures, and there you understand these obstructions are sorta like k-th derivatives measuring how far your G-structure is from being flat
[00:11:34] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[00:11:38] <johnkeats6> and the obstructions live, you guessed it, in a cohomology

[00:19:04] <tusko> how can I show that I can disregard constants in my limit?
[00:19:15] <isekaijin> johnkeats6: G is an arbitrary Lie or algebraic group? (Depending on the category we are working in.)
[00:19:24] <isekaijin> tusko: Context?
[00:20:41] <tusko> lim[N -> \infty] (ln(N) + C5)/(C6 + C7ln(N) + ln^2(N)) = lim[N -> \infty] 1/ln(N)
[00:20:50] <tusko> I want to justify that
[00:20:57] <johnkeats6> isekaijin, G structures only make sense for G subgroup GL_n. other than that, anything. but nothing guarantees that all the obstructions vanishing means integrable, there's counter-examples. you can then impose restrictions on the group to guarantee that, e.g. finite type
[00:21:30] <isekaijin> Wow, cool.
[00:22:00] <isekaijin> I almost want to kick my past calculus student self for thinking geometry is boring.
[00:24:34] <Z-module> tusko:  yes, you can do it by simply dividing every term in sight by 1/ln^2(N)  before letting N -> \infty
[00:24:47] <Z-module> sorry, dividing by ln^2(N)
[00:25:40] <tusko> ah ok, that's right
[00:27:34] <tusko> doesn't that limit just go to 1?
[00:27:44] <Z-module> so then   1/ln(N) + C5/ln^2(N) -> 0,  while   C6/ln^2(N) + C7/ln(N) + 1  -> 1
[00:27:51] <Z-module> goes to 0
[00:28:14] <tusko> ok, right, it goes to 0
[00:28:41] <tusko> and that allows me to say that 1/ln(N) is sufficient?
[00:28:49] <tusko> because the limit exists?
[00:28:55] <Z-module> sufficent for what?
[00:29:00] <isekaijin> Sufficient, period.
[00:29:14] <isekaijin> Like, when you don't need more.
[00:29:39] <tusko> well I'd like to replace lim[N -> \infty] (ln(N) + C5)/(C6 + C7ln(N) + ln^2(N)) with lim[N -> \infty] 1/ln(N)
[00:29:57] <Z-module> I would go through the intermediate thing I did, tusko
[00:30:27] <tusko> I did work on paper here and divide every term by ln^@(N)
[00:30:35] <tusko> ln^2(N)

[08:49:47] <B11529> you can't do this?
[08:50:59] <tusko> I am failing to show that it is -1 for a primitive root.
[08:51:05] <tusko> 8 is a primitive root for 11

[08:51:31] <tusko> oh yeah
[08:52:11] <tusko> Ok, but I wonder how I can prove that it is a property of the primitive root.
[08:52:25] <B11529> well, what's special about a primitive root?

[08:58:41] <droid3> hey guys this tonights topic is not so much on a math subject or problem.
[08:59:02] <droid3> Its on teaching mathematics thru videos.
[08:59:45] <droid3> I am getting to the point that its really time consuming to generate the latex then a picture of it and embedded it in my powerpoint slide show.
[08:59:58] <droid3> Works well for less involved math.
[09:00:25] <droid3> But to do out more difficult math proofs or more time consuming math formulas , proofs, examples ,...etc
[09:00:41] <droid3> I was thinking on a better way.
[09:01:06] <droid3> And i heard WACOM Intuos graphics tablets are the way most a achieving it.
[09:01:50] <droid3> As they can actually write out there math with a stylus on a white board software or even thru applications like a pdf,powerpoint ,...etc
[09:01:58] <Galois> you can make a million dollars a month teaching math through tiktok videos
[09:02:26] <droid3> Adding this functionality would be a great feature/ability/enhancement to making math videos.
[09:03:03] <Guest78> heygalois, are ideals which have only 1...basis element(?) always radical?
[09:03:14] <droid3> I was curious anybody know good WACOM Intuos interms of is it like your writting with a piece of paper and pencil. That good!!!
[09:03:23] <droid3> Or is it still not much better then a mouse
[09:03:29] <droid3> ?
[09:04:10] <Guest78> just use an ipad, droid. its probably cheaper and easier
[09:04:14] <droid3> As it looks like people using it are getting really good quality and if you use it with say a powerpoint application that allows one to pause video recording as your making it.
[09:04:50] <droid3> This would make it so much less effort in editing times and doing more math / going farther with math proofs ,examples , cool neat problems ,...etc

[09:05:55] <droid3> Guest78 i could use a phone , ipad ,computer whatever. The point is the stylus is good. Aka works as good as using old paper and pencil under a projector
[09:06:03] <droid3> then that definitely make it easier.
[09:06:13] <Guest78> thats personal preference right?
[09:06:39] <droid3> And worth it but if the stylus is as bad as a mouse then its going to be worthless and still cumbersome to make math from handwritten.
[09:07:22] <droid3> I do like latex to images and just embedding in slideshows but i find if i can achieve just writting out with a stylus in decent handwritten it save a ton of time.

[09:08:36] <Guest78> maybe? Go try it yourself
[09:09:06] <Guest78> my handwriting is better on a whiteboard than using the ipad, but thats just me
[09:09:07] <droid3> That what i am curious on. Because if it does then that gives me two methods  1) use latex and images of them  2) handwrite it out digital on whiteboard software or powerpoint

[09:10:04] <droid3> That would work but i kind of like the theme i have.
[09:10:28] <droid3> Aka just recording the whiteboard ,or slideshow and not getting myself in the way.
[09:10:57] <droid3> I just feel if its not in live classroom. Then online is more engaging if you only focus on the slideshow itself.
[09:11:04] <droid3> But that just my opinion
[09:11:31] <droid3> making slideshow more appealing makes the video more appealing obviously
[09:11:59] <droid3> But if the stylus can safe time in doing latex/images out and embedding each one as i go slide by slide.

[09:14:02] <droid3> I like the pausing feature you have with these slideshow softwares most when recording a video dont have the ability to pause /compose ones thoughts/pause before making a mistake,...etc then resuming when ready as well.
[09:14:18] <greenbagels> Galois: please don't say such cursed yet true things
[09:14:30] <somiaj> I just use an ipad with a good quality annotation app, record the screen, use a video editor to pause/edit/cut the recording.
[09:14:45] <greenbagels> yeah honestly if you're handwriting things why bother with latex
[09:15:03] <greenbagels> i guess having searchable text is a good idea
[09:15:37] <droid3> Ya WACOM Intuos is something i like to at least try maybe it also depends on the particular whiteboard application used as well???? Not sure because i have seen some using just ms paint but comes out pretty damn good by the looks of it if one uses a reasonable stylus.
[09:15:56] <droid3> But its hard to tell full how some are achieving this.

[09:17:02] <Guest78> hahn-banach is proved with zorns lemma iirc
[09:17:26] <droid3> Curious also in your guys opinion what whiteboard software do you think is best.
[09:18:03] <droid3> Interms of pausing video/resuming , switching the pen from to erase, highlighter , lasso cutting ,...etc
[09:19:05] <droid3> Aka even though writting with WACOM Intuos maybe the key. It also depends a little on how easy it is to pause/resume and transition from different things and still limit the amount of video editing you have to do to fix stuff.

[09:25:43] <Galois> the problem with a graphics tablet is that you can't see what you're writing in the place where you're writing it
[09:25:56] <Galois> you write in one place (the tablet) and have to look in another place (the screen) to see what you wrote
[09:25:58] <droid3> Ya well you must have a different OBS version because mine only turns from start recording to stop recording there is no pause
[09:26:12] <droid3> But i admit its probably an old OBS version

[09:26:57] <Galois> it's not a software problem. A graphics tablet is a black slate. It doesn't have display capability.
[09:27:15] <Guest78> just use an ipad with the Onenote pdf software
[09:27:45] <droid3> However i run into the same problem no matter what presentation/recording software i come across. Its the ability to WACOM Intuos /write out math instead of having to latex/convert to image and insert it for each slide.
[09:27:49] <B11529> oh i misread, thought you meant tablet.
[09:28:11] <Galois> I find that a surface pro is better at drawing things like shading

[09:28:27] <droid3> Its fine but i like the ability to handwrite out my math digitally if its a good way to do it.
[09:29:17] <droid3> Why use a ipad or other stuff . What wrong with WACOM Intuos it comes with a stylus and a usb cable you plug the tablet board in to the compute.
[09:30:14] <droid3> It only be good if the handwritting was good. And it integrates well with most major software such as powerpoint , obs ,impress, microsoft whiteboard ...etc
[09:30:36] <Guest78> for a prime ideal, is it always true that the radical of a prime ideal corresponds to just stripping off the exponent? So I = <x^2> then sqrt(I) = <x> ?
[09:30:38] <Galois> I already explained.

[09:37:38] <Galois> I don't think powerpoint is capable of doing these kinds of graphics natively. You would need an external program.
[09:37:51] <droid3> beamer does look nice though Galois
[09:38:35] <droid3> However from beamer can you record this slide show example and add audio or is beamer just for latex and slideshow without making audio/video ????

[09:38:47] <Galois> just the pdf

[09:39:18] <droid3> ya but you can always embed or make a powerpoint slideshow of the pdf pages. That not to hard.
[09:39:43] <droid3> And record it with powerpoint , impress , or OBS
[09:41:08] <droid3> Also Galois it wouldnt be that hard to create that purple color , text layout boxes , and template slide. And then you just import from a template if you where using impress or powerpoint.

[10:05:22] <Galois> we've already explained why.
[10:05:40] <droid3> i dont see your issue because you have presenter view in powerpoint

[10:06:51] <int-e> uh this is getting heated and it's pretty far off topic
[10:06:59] <Galois> that's the entire problem. You can't look down at what you're writing

[10:10:38] <Galois> the critical factor isn't the direction in which you look. It's the disconnection between the (only) place where you can write and the (only, but different) place where you can see your writing

[10:35:20] <nagefire> I guess the big advantage is that the markers never run dry, but they still break over time
[10:39:22] <droid3> how about the ability to save stuff that seems like a good feature.
[10:39:48] <droid3> But i agree it seems like a little learning curve for teachers to get fast with.

[10:40:34] <droid3> Not that it seems difficult but enough to throw your teaching off possible.

[10:44:30] <droid3> in your opinion what do you think is more difficult to teach what audience middle , highschool , or college levels
[10:44:34] <droid3> ?
[10:44:57] <nagefire> middle and high school. American education system makes it bad practice to question or correct the authority figure
[10:45:11] <loller_> if I have arrived at the following differential equation: http://mathb.in/68047 , when I am supposed to have a Bessel differential equation
[10:45:17] <nagefire> It makes it hard to gauge your audience's understanding of concepts or ask for feedback
[10:45:33] <loller_> has something gone wrong or can this be transformed? my issue is that I have two arbitrary constants a^2 and b^2, when of them is supposed to be 1

[10:46:40] <loller_> if I simply divide by b^2 I get the proper form in the third term but it messes up the other two on the left hand side....
[10:46:44] <nagefire> higher eduction relies more on the socratic method, but sometimes I still get an audience that doesn't want to interact
[10:47:01] <droid3> nagefire really i would find elementary school and middle school more challenging because it be hard to engage them, as well as the possibilities of students acting up
[10:47:47] <nagefire> droid3 I haven't had problems with acting up, I teach my Sunday school every other week to 12-18 year olds and I'll just come out and roast them when they misbehave
[10:47:58] <nagefire> it probably helps that I'm not much older than them (24)
[10:48:15] <droid3> You get less of that as you go up in the levels highschool a little less , college should be none because there ,there mostly because they want to pursue a major ..etc
[10:49:05] <nagefire> Yeah, in my public schools I was mostly part of the group that attending the classes where everyone would pay attention and try to learn
[10:49:30] <nagefire> So my experience is mostly with well-behaved students

[10:54:52] <droid3> curious do highschools and college usually have summer school for training talented students. Or is usually summer schools mostly for remedial math training.
[10:55:17] <nagefire> No, when I attended classes there my teachers would allow students to teach sometimes
[10:55:32] <nagefire> One of the peculiarities of living in a semi-small town
[10:55:55] <droid3> I was a bit curious if highschools and colleges do both sides in summer school aka train gifted students for the Ya well AMC 8/10/12 and AIME /USAMO/USAJMO
[10:56:25] <droid3> levels
[10:57:11] <nagefire> My school district was too small to have that, but if they did I probably would have attended it
[10:57:21] <droid3> It seems there just wouldnt be enough time to train gifted students or students that wanted to do competitions/like solving problems in the regular school year.
[10:57:43] <nagefire> In Dallas they offer special courses to prepare you year round
[10:57:46] <nagefire> As elective credits
[10:58:10] <droid3> Yet for the simpler levels like AMC 8/10/12 i dont think they need summer school for because there not that challenging
[10:58:10] <nagefire> Most of the top performers in CS, Math, and Science UIL attended those training sessions
[10:58:41] <droid3> Compared to AIME , USA/MO or USA/JMO levels
[10:59:41] <droid3> but what i am getting at is sure a few training is fine to prepare for AMC 8/10/12 levels.
[11:00:20] <droid3> But once you get up to AIME , USA/MO or USA/JMO level i see no way other then to have a seperate summer school to go over to prepare for these intense levels.
[11:01:06] <droid3> I know if i was teaching i could perhaps prepare students to do well on AMC 8/10/12 levels and take them during semester test.
[11:01:42] <nagefire> There are a lot of isolated examples of good teachers going the extra mile to foment that kind of development
[11:02:16] <droid3> But the AIME and USA/MO or USA/JMO that seems a bit far fetch for anybody to obtain in a few sessions it requires a course or summer school if the students into doing math clubs / competitions.
[11:02:20] <nagefire> But most people that excel at that kind of coordination don't work in gradeschool or high school, at least that I've seen
[11:02:59] <droid3> well ya ofcourse as it be to easy to material for them.
[11:03:12] <droid3> And it would be rather boring to waste there talents
[11:03:36] <droid3> But off /on that another story
[11:04:14] <droid3> And i am not even sure if passed AIME levels if you can set up a summer school for training.
[11:05:03] <droid3> From what i am aware of the IMO has to be done at a particular summer school place with particular teachers that run the summer school IMO training team.
[11:05:31] <droid3> Plus at that point your working with the 6 best math students in the USA.
[11:05:52] <nagefire> It's not a waste of their talents by any means. My high school didn't even offer a calc course I could take, I had to teach myself from a 60's era encyclopedia britannica book to take the exam
[11:06:06] <nagefire> I can only imagine what more I could have learned if I'd had a proper mentor to help me
[11:07:10] <droid3> But AIME its possible and not sure about USA/JMO or USA/MO if one can create a summer school to teach them at that level. Or if when there at USA/xxxx levels that is done only at a special IMO place.
[11:08:45] <droid3> AIME no problem though you still got around thousands of people
[11:09:21] <droid3> that qualify and if you got a really good school you probably have a handful to make a summer school for talent.
[11:12:17] <droid3> nagefire so most likely USA/JMO or USA/MO levels only got about 400 students that qualify in USA so your probably not holding many summer schools for them thru out the USA.
[11:13:55] <droid3> But its probably only like a few schools that host these type of summer schools and the IMO team is done at Carnegie Mellon University  they call it the MOP program
[11:14:02] <nagefire> I imagine that the summer schools happen at college campuses. We had a foreign-exchange student take a summer course here in engineering and modelling for similar reasons

[11:16:37] <droid3> But for the ACM 8/10/12 or AIME i see no reason why a school couldnt setup a summer school/session for those purpose.

[19:54:41] <riv> the second equation is conservation of volume
[19:54:44] <laurus> tolarz: A function that takes values in the extended real numbers
[19:55:23] <dude12312414> yeah that comes from incompressibility, which adds another constraint on the velocities. Probably the pressure can't be just anything in that case

[22:30:01] <droid3> but it would require rather trying them out and seeing how good they integrate in to different software as well.
[22:31:04] <droid3> So 1) they have to integrate well into the software i use for developing math 2) they have to have stylus that write great digitally so the quality comes down to how well your handwritting is not the stylus.
[22:31:33] <droid3> If those two things are not an issue then it would seem really reasonable to have one if your doing educational videos.
[22:32:14] <droid3> Anyway dont want to ramble on about last night talk. Just more finishing my thoughts on it.
[22:32:40] <Batzy> I don't write latex because it's faster than handwriting, i do it because my handwriting is horrendous
[22:33:18] <droid3> Because of the digital stylus or just because you dont have good handwritting ?
[22:33:25] <droid3> Because there a difference.
[22:34:54] <droid3> Plus i still think if the stylus is accurate one can learn to have good handwritting by just digitally erasing enough times. However ya latex beats out any handwritting almost so its a trade of which route to go.
[22:35:32] <droid3> I still say though for me i want to at least try out the stylus/tablet options as i may find that is a good option for me. At least sometimes.
[22:36:16] <Batzy> there's actually not much difference in my handwriting between an ipad and paper
[22:36:33] <Batzy> maybe i am less used to the digital stylus and so i write slower, and it might be *very slightly* better but
[22:36:38] <droid3> do you use your finger , a mouse or a stylus?
[22:36:51] <Batzy> stylus, like a pen
[22:37:38] <droid3> Have you ever tried a mouse one can download a whiteboard program and uses his computer mouse however its really cumbersome. Even a paint program it kind of looks like crap to me.
[22:37:50] <Batzy> why would i ever want to use a mouse
[22:38:51] <droid3> true well one your like me and just playing around with stuff you think ya i still can get use to whiteboard programs with my mouse. Then if i get a wacom tablet/stylus i know how to use the application fast and efficiently with it.

[22:39:32] <droid3> Anyway you wouldnt want to use a mouse.
[22:39:51] <Batzy> I think when unis were all closed due to covid, my university issued ipads to professors and they would share a stream of it over zoom or something. They'd just use a random note taking app like goodnotes or something to write
[22:41:10] <droid3> Ya another option is just writting out math/ stem based formulas on regular paper and scanning it into your computer.
[22:41:47] <Batzy> if you're going to do that just use latex honestly
[22:42:00] <droid3> then make a slide show still going to try that but i feel the quality might not be there because of the pen thickness. But maybe if i use a magic marker of reasonable thickness i can get it to pop.
[22:42:12] <Batzy> wait, why are you trying to get away from latex again?
[22:42:35] <Batzy> if it's too slow, I recommend using one of those dual markdown/latex things. I find that to be much faster

[22:43:00] <Batzy> for example droid https://obsidian.md/ supports latex
[22:43:13] <droid3> because latex a pain in the ass for whole document stuff the layout always screws up you cannt add spaces ,indentations ,...etc the natural way you do with word processing programs , and alot of funky issues more for layout stuff.

[22:43:41] <Batzy> yeah in that case you might find a markdown/latex processor to be a healthy middle ground
[22:43:43] <droid3> Now doing mathematical statements/formula or doing a few liner math equations in tex/latex is very easy.
[22:44:14] <Guest7842> Isanyone available to discuss leading term ideals? Given the ideal I = <xy^2 - x^2, x^2y - y>, the Leading Term ideals are: LT1 = <y^5, xy, x^2>, LT2 = <y^3, xy^2, x^2y , x^3>, LT3 = <x^4, x^2 y, y^2>
[22:44:15] <Guest7842> Where does these ideals come from and what do they mean?
[22:44:21] <droid3> Its the writting the whole thing in latex. The article if it was in word would be no problem to layout properly
[22:46:19] <droid3> There is also MathML and other markup languages for the web to create website with math formula. However those are usually xml based which is cool but alot of typing or nesting tags within tags ,...etc So its doable but time consuming. And doesnt let you get math ideas,thoughts,or your slideshow done in a fast amount of time.
[22:47:54] <droid3> Anyway ya the problem is probably more me in that i have to eventually take the time to become proficient with latex/tex editors and math typesetting software. Perhaps some year when i am into it enough to devote alot of time to learning it all.
[22:48:09] <Guest7842> oh, I think these are the leading term ideals for grobner basis elements of the ideal
[22:48:12] <Batzy> it honestly doesnt take too much time

[22:48:55] <droid3> But right now its just a bottleneck to get to the main objective making creative math /stem education videos on topics most dont cover or realize.
[22:49:00] <Guest7842> just go onto Overleaf.com, copy a template, and do it
[22:49:15] <Batzy> oh you're making videos?
[22:49:24] <somiaj> I actually prefer latex, it is a typesetter (not a wordprocessor) and it does a much better job at laying out documents and imo looks way better than word (but yes the draw back is spaces, indents, etc are set by the metafont and size they take up)
[22:49:51] <droid3> I know i know i just really dont want to take the time its a hassle
[22:49:52] <somiaj> But like anything, it takes time to learn, but I think it is worth it in the end.
[22:49:55] <Batzy> based on some videos i've seen the rule seems to be "do whatever the fuck you want"
[22:50:23] <droid3> " (but yes the draw back is spaces, indents, etc are set by the metafont and size they take up)" ya and that my issue someday to figure out to become proficient in it.
[22:50:27] <Batzy> i know 3b1b wrote a whole framework for making his animations. THAT would probably take awhile to learn
[22:50:48] <Batzy> if you were going to make animations it would probably be easier to use something like "processing"
[22:51:30] <X-Scale> 3b1b animations are pretty fluid and amazing
[22:51:38] <Guest7842> animations is best done with the same software 3b1b wrote
[22:51:44] <Batzy> an interesting idea that might be necessary for you is how to render like latex but with transparent backgrounds..
[22:51:55] <Batzy> but i think that is done currently, ive seen some discord bots do it i think
[22:51:55] <Guest7842> But note that he uses a specialized version and there is a Community version that everyone uses
[22:51:57] <droid3> ya it is using powerpoint , obs , impress ,...etc that the way to go for slideshows as well as video creating as well.
[22:52:46] <Batzy> processing + latex with transparent backgrounds seems like a good starting stack to make those sorts of videos
[22:52:52] <droid3> ya 3b1b has designed great software but i didnt really want to just copy his look or use his software. There alot of great channels that seem to use his software already.
[22:53:07] <Batzy> his software is reportedly difficult to learn
[22:53:18] <Batzy> i heard it's not well documented and it's not necessarily even a great implementation
[22:53:21] <Guest7842> THat is why there is the Community version of his software
[22:53:28] <Guest7842> which is well documented and has a very good community

[22:57:17] <Batzy> im sure youll find something you like
[22:57:25] <droid3> So its like mathlogger usually more complex videos but 3b1b covers making his videos better in quality.
[22:58:02] <droid3> Both really really good in quality and difficulty levels but i just point out slight differences in there focus i guess.
[22:58:04] <Guest7842> Batzy you can't
[22:58:04] <Guest7842> but it would be really really really useful
[22:58:15] <Guest7842> and honestly i am really surprised this isn't done yet
[22:59:13] <droid3> At any extent i was a bit curious about how he is making the numbers animated if he is just in front of green screen how is these math equations being interactive in his videos. Is he using a smart board, It looks like he could just be clicking on animated slideshows.
[22:59:32] <Batzy> he is 100% not using a smartboard
[22:59:41] <Batzy> i guess i should watch the video before saying that
[23:00:19] <Guest7842> peak video style is of course by Dr. Brunton with their Lightboard + animation/processing
[23:00:36] <Guest7842> wish I had the funding (and space) for that
[23:00:48] <droid3> Then there is also the numberphile videos which are also as good of quality as 3b1b and mathlogger. But there flavor is more live recording the mathematician and throwing some animation in between/illustrations.

[23:05:00] <laurus> I'm confused about this definition: https://a.uguu.se/lOGVLBtq.png . It says u can be either measurable or integrable. But if it is just measurable, that doesn't guarantee that the integral is finite, correct? So am I right in understanding that 1_A u may not be integrable?
[23:05:46] <droid3> live is easier to record then doing fully illustration/animation most time. But numberphile equal impressive if not more sometimes. Because alot of time the audience isnt so focus on it having to be pretty as long as its understandable and is good content which numberphile seems to pump out pretty well.

[23:13:24] <laurus> Batzy: Right, for positive functions u we have that u is integrable if and only if the integral of u is finite
[23:13:43] <laurus> And, this integral would exist even if u is not integrable

[23:18:19] <laurus> Batzy: well, that was my initial question. the point I understand now is that this definition isn't really about whether 1_A u is integrable or not, it's just defining what the integral \int_A u is.
[23:18:59] <Batzy> alright
[23:19:11] <laurus> Batzy: well if u is in M+ but not in L^1 then since 1_A is in M+, 1_A u is in M+, so we would use the definition of integral for functions in M+
[23:19:49] <laurus> which is either the integral for a simple function or the supremum thing.
[23:20:06] <Batzy> yeah but then why mention M^+
[23:20:35] <laurus> Batzy: I think the point is that we  can still do \int_A u d\mu even if u is not in L^1.
