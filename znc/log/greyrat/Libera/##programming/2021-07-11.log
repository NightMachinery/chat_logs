[01:55:44] <blahboybaz> When it comes to testing a class why would someone choose mock over spying? It seem like what you can do with a mock is limited compared to spying on an actual object of the real implementation
[01:57:09] <blahboybaz> Well, on second thought - I don't know if you can spy on a class per se. From what I have gathered you spy on methods of a class or on functions but maybe you can't spy on a class
[01:58:35] <arahael> blahboybaz: "mock" is a bit of a technical word in this case - you could say it's jargon.  "spying" isn't established as jargon, though - you'd have to explain what you mean exactly.
[02:01:36] <blahboybaz> arahael: Well, from what I seem to be reading so far (and I could be wrong), I can only seem to test the constructor with a mock but with a spy I can test methods in the class but not the constructor. Am I missing something here?
[02:02:12] <blahboybaz> I guess I don't get what the use cases are for either
[02:02:17] <arahael> blahboybaz: "with a spy"?  I think you must be using a very particular testing framework or language that has specfic support for that and they chose to use those names?
[02:02:33] <blahboybaz> jest spyOn()
[02:02:47] <arahael> What language and framework is that in?
[02:03:02] <blahboybaz> for me it is node but more broadly jest is for js
[02:03:09] <arahael> Ah, jest.
[02:03:21] <blahboybaz> mmm hmm
[02:04:23] <arahael> blahboybaz: Ok, just checked their docs.  It sounds like they're dynamically replacing the function with a proxy that exposes the inputs and outputs of that method even when it's called indirectly.
[02:04:43] <arahael> blahboybaz: In python, this same thing is called "patching", and is part of python's mocking library.

[02:06:11] <blahboybaz> My best understanding is that mocking is to isolate what you are testing (so you mock dependencies - stuff like network calls and api calls).
[02:07:11] <blahboybaz> I don't have network calls or api calls in my codebase but then the only other option I see is spying on an object and I don't see that you can do that with the class constructor (just it's methods).

[02:08:37] <arahael> blahboybaz: Ok, well, a quick summary.  Suppose you write a function "printLinesInFile".  A naive way to write that would be to pass in a filename, as a string, and the function implementation will open that file, iterate over the lines, adn print them out directly.
[02:09:06] *** Quits: furrykef (~furrykef@ip68-229-199-137.ok.ok.cox.net) (Quit: gotta relog)
[02:09:17] <arahael> blahboybaz: However, what if you want to print lines in a stream you open from an http site?  Or what if you want to test that in a test case but you don't want to prepare a file first, etc?
[02:09:46] <arahael> blahboybaz: So you want to "invert" the control - by passing in a "Stream", which you've already opened, and the function implementation then just has to iterate over the lines.
[02:09:58] *** Joins: furrykef (~furrykef@ip68-229-199-137.ok.ok.cox.net)
[02:10:51] <arahael> blahboybaz: There's also the matter of the print function it uses: You should invert that too, and explicitly pass in a routine to allow it to print to a potentially more appropriate output:  In this way the function's responsibility becomes much simpler: It has to iterate over whatever stream it gets, determine the lines, and then call the provided function appropriately to output them.
[02:10:51] <blahboybaz> So like writing code that produces the result the caller is expecting but doesn't know the source isn't the real source?
[02:11:32] <arahael> blahboybaz: Doesn't know - and more importantly - doesn't care, it's no-longer part of it's responsibilities.
[02:11:40] <arahael> blahboybaz: However...  That was just background information. :D
[02:11:50] <blahboybaz> ok
[02:12:09] <arahael> blahboybaz: If you do this a lot in languages such as javascript, many people feel that this makes the code complicated.  Everything has dependencies, and you have to explicitly set them up all the time.
[02:12:33] <arahael> blahboybaz: Wiring up these dependencies can be tedious.  (I personally prefer to wire them up manually, but there are different schools of thought here)
[02:13:21] <arahael> blahboybaz: In dynamic langauges such as javascript, python, ruby, etc, many people think: "The language is dynamic. Why not have the function leverage that, and instead of getting the dependency from the arguments, why not just get it from the global state of the program?"
[02:13:21] <blahboybaz> arahael: I thought that a testing framework essentially does what we are talking about (IOC and injecting values)
[02:13:33] <arahael> blahboybaz: I was getting to that. :)

[02:14:19] <arahael> blahboybaz: So yes, a testing framework works with that idea - it acknowledges that people often prefer to get those dependencies from teh global state, and so, the test framework offers functionality to "swap those out temporarily", for the purpose of testing.

[02:14:58] <blahboybaz> Right on
[02:15:01] <arahael> blahboybaz: These dependencies are global, however, so you can only swap it out globally - you can't say, "test this... With those dependencies", and "test that, with those otehr dependencies" - you can only do one, and then the other, by swapping them out temporarily.
[02:15:33] <arahael> blahboybaz: So these dependencies should be considered global singletons, effectively.  Just want to make that explicit if you want to use that for your main program.

[02:29:48] <arahael> blahboybaz: That's a common implementation, yeah, though I was being a bit more meta: In javascript, you can consider the class itself, rather than the instance, to also be a singleton.
[02:30:12] <arahael> blahboybaz: It's objects all the way down. :)
[02:31:05] <arahael> (Not sure how one normally sets up singletons in javascript - maybe rather than 'this.instance = new myClass', you'd be doing myClass.instance = new myClass)
[02:31:25] * arahael doesn't usually use javascript.
[02:31:39] <blahboybaz> I see
[02:32:11] <pulse> singletons are typically implemented as IIFE's (immediately invoked function expressions) in javascript
[02:32:28] <blahboybaz> Seems like just a regular object is by nature a singleton then (something like let obj = ();) then
[02:32:38] <pulse> something like.. let x = (function() { /*private things*/ return { /* public api */ }; }());
[02:32:54] <pulse> or you can just do an object literal if you don't care for encapsulation

[02:37:44] <arahael> blahboybaz: That's generally part of "TDD" philosophy, but ultimately ti gives you confidence that your test is actually testing something.  I've seen people write a test, that just passes, but it tests nothing.  If it fails first, you've proven to yourself that the state it's testing for is actually being tested when you implement the test so that it passes.
[02:37:58] <Lyn> didn't read the chat, but making sure something fails a test is useful to weed out improper but potential use

[03:51:24] <arahael> I've used decompilers in the past, a good way to get some insight into a closed-source project, but I've only used RedGate, which is .NET only.

[03:52:18] <Twix> Well, there is this NSA thingy ... Ghidra. It is free software
[03:52:21] <vdamewood> If you decompile a C++ program with a C decompiler, will it still look normal, but with explicit vtables, and still-mangled names?
[03:52:30] <pikapika> I don't know how optimized it is, its a program from like 15 years ago
[03:52:34] <pulse> this reminds me of an instance where my old boss asked us to decompile the competitors C# code and it was literally the full source code without comments
[03:52:38] <pulse> but function names etc. were all tehre
[03:52:46] <pulse> at least i think that's how it worked
[03:52:54] <arahael> vdamewood: Right.
[03:53:08] <Twix> Then there is IDA pro, i think the decompiler is free for private use. At least for some platforms
[03:53:25] <arahael> pulse: Decompiling the byte-code compiled langauges tends to be that good - RedGate especially.
[03:53:41] <pulse> i think it was basically the full source
[03:53:48] <pulse> so we just copied their entire business logic

[04:00:44] <PlanckWalk> It's just a bit of untangling mostly, but sometimes it is just rearranged and unexpected
[04:01:30] <PlanckWalk> Un-optimized code is almost worse in some ways
[04:02:20] <PlanckWalk> Like, "WTF does this load a register with a constant, write it to memory, read it back from memory, and copy it to a second register, then write that register back to the same memory location again?"
[04:03:23] <pulse> there's probably lot of unrolling of loops and such too
[04:03:26] <pulse> at least i imagine it as such
[04:03:31] <pulse> i've only ever seen decompiled C#
[04:04:03] <pulse> well, i watched a youtube video about some guy decompiling stuff at one point
[04:04:08] <pulse> i think it was to fix a bug in a really old game
[04:04:20] <pulse> and somehow he succeeded, and it looked borderline impossible iirc
[04:04:27] <PlanckWalk> Decompiled Java is usually pretty easy to read
[04:04:40] <pulse> probably similar to C#
[04:04:41] <PlanckWalk> Except that all the well-known decompilers have bugs.
[04:06:00] <PlanckWalk> So you either want to fix them in your local copy (sending patches is an exercise in frustration usually) or use at least two and compare the output.
[04:06:45] <pikapika> PlanckWalk, hows the quality for C decomp
[04:07:10] <PlanckWalk> No idea for decompiling-to-C
[04:07:20] <PlanckWalk> Disassembling is pretty straightforward though
[04:07:20] <pikapika> For the program I am experimentingw with, C should be the most natural output format
[04:07:36] <pikapika> Disasm is easy but reading machine generated asm is tedious
[04:08:00] <PlanckWalk> Last time I used decompile-to-C was ages ago and it was pretty poor then.

[05:50:36] <blahboybaz> ahh
[05:50:55] <arahael> Or when the dependencies have rather intricate behaviour you need to preserve in order for the subject under test (which is not itself mock'ed) to operate.
[05:50:56] <blahboybaz> So I should just do spyOn() instead of mocking for everything I'm testing?

[05:51:50] <arahael> spyOn is mostly, from what I can tell, for those dependencies that you can't normally directly access, eg, for globals.  If you can pass in the dependency normally, then I wouldn't bother with spyOn.
[05:51:56] <blahboybaz> but them I'm back to not being able to use spyOn() to test the constructor
[05:52:17] <arahael> I think the python naming here is better: It calls spyOn "patch" instead.  Much clearer.

[11:42:35] <node1> vdamewood, I would love to get my self wrong here. Please prove it
[11:42:37] <xerxes> node1: a malicious code can do anything.
[11:43:17] <node1> I see..
[11:43:42] <vdamewood> node1: For one, all of the 'private' parts are still specified in the header. Second, machine code has no 'private' keyword so it's all accrssible after being compiled.
[11:44:14] <vdamewood> All the encapsulation does is let your compiler now that you shouldn't be doing something, and your compiler gives an error.
[11:44:14] <GeDaMo> Zsolt: possibly it's the font being used for the console?

[13:54:55] <W> hmm that reminds me, what are people thoughts on type-matched arguments/parameters? I.e. most people know named parameters, where you can do `sendTo(name=myRecipient, address=myAddress)` or `sendTo(address=myAddress, name=myRecipient)` as equivalent calls, rather than positional; but typed arguments would be matched by type, and you could not e.g. define a method `sendTo(string,string)` because string is ambiguous

[13:56:01] <arahael> W: In Haskell, I like it. Avoids a whole class of errors, and yes, typically implemented as a wrapped struct.
[13:56:33] <W> oh Haskell has this? Neat. Are the arguments also positional, or can you then swap it around and have it match up by type?
[13:57:02] <deniska> W: so that you can do both sendTo(name, address) and sendTo(address, name)?
[13:57:07] <W> yes
[13:57:19] <arahael> W: Well, they're not positional per se based on type - they're still positional as per usual - you can just almost trivially wrap the types up so that it's checked.
[13:57:23] <W> the actual caller order would be irrelevant
[13:57:32] <deniska> W: I think it quickly degrades into de-facto named arguments: sendTo((name) name_s, (address) address_s)
[13:58:02] <arahael> W: But you could eg, use a "Record" - basically a struct, and specify your types in any order by name (and the type has to match, too).
[13:58:09] <W> deniska, sure, you could see it this way - but most likely it's an incentive to actually use the types more widely
[13:59:02] <deniska> W: I don't think "width and height should be of different type" is a solution… to any sort of problem :)
[13:59:11] <W> deniska, e.g. if you are just feeding something from elsewhere into sendTo, might as well make that other thing elsewhere return address rather than string
[13:59:18] <arahael> W: Swift does the syntax as you provide it, though - ie, in swift, you do specify names in argumetns - if the argumetn has a name, you have to include the name - and the position and type has to match

[14:01:55] <arahael> amigojapan: You can omit optional arguments in swift, but the order has be the same....
[14:02:00] <W> arahael, I want to avoid actually having to specify the name *or* care about the position, the idea is that if things are their own type all the time, and this pervades code of a language, then it's one less thing to have to think about
[14:02:52] <W> the idea would be that using string as a type itself is rare outside of general string-manipulation, and similar with numeric types and mathematics

[14:13:00] <arahael> Having the name information in the type _is_ very nice.

[14:22:24] <arahael> rannnn8888: And yep, sendUser requires two argumetns, but on line 97, you've only given it one, it needs a second argument - (which, curiously, is called 'pr')

[14:22:25] <rannnn8888>     inputCh = streamInputs(done, pr)
[14:22:39] <W> deniska, for what it's worth, I am also against type inference except in limited circumstances (Java's is mostly okay as it is now), and do want the type information to be local to any code where it matters. But if variables and parameters to the context are explicitly typed, that's usually there. I guess I can see how `sendTo(database.getAddresses())` might hide the type information though
[14:23:15] <arahael> W: I'd be cautious about having too much type inferrence if it's subtype polymorphism.  But if it's algebraic polymorphism I tend to prefer inferrence.
[14:23:35] <amigojapan> Oh rannnn8888 the problem is now sendUser(.  You are missing a parameter again
[14:23:40] <rannnn8888> arahael so make like a two ? inputCh and inputCh2 ?
[14:24:42] <arahael> W: It also helps heaps having sum types. (Which don't exist in Java, still, I think)
[14:25:10] <W> (and even how that might lead to errors, e.g. sendTo taking both address and set<address>, and getAddresses accidentally being changed to return address)
[14:25:35] <arahael> W: THat'd be implicit type conversion. Yeah, I don't like that either.
[14:25:40] <W> arahael, not automatic ones no, but you can of course implement something like that yourself
[14:25:57] <amigojapan> rannnn8888: you have bodyStr, err := sendUser(input) which has only one parameter but it would have two. User and pr
[14:26:32] <amigojapan> rannnn8888: this would also happen in python

[14:40:04] <amigojapan> arahael: I was looking at the one that wants two strings
[14:40:08] <W> deniska, types definitely hold generalized _semantics_, which may or may not include "how it will be used". And there's other benefits to more generally separating types by use, i.e. enabling easier refactoring when one use requires something more than was anticipated
[14:40:30] <rannnn8888> amigojapan i mean input inputCh and input inputCh2
[14:40:58] <amigojapan> rannnn8888: no no. You need to serve two strings like (user,pr)

[14:47:07] <mrig> The article that I read yesterday on why C is still there, states that it is exactly because it is not strict that it is preferred for the places that it is still used.

[14:49:28] <arahael> W: Another possibility is what haskell calls "type punning" (not enabled by default - it's a syntax extension).  Basically, when using the name of a field in a record, it assumes you want to bind it to a variable of the same name.

[14:50:33] <deniska> W: let me rephrase. In good API design you want to require as little as possible from the parameters you receive, because lifting requirements is not a breaking change, but adding requirements is
[14:50:39] <rannnn8888> amigojapan and then how get the pr ?
[14:50:43] <deniska> W: and in the return types of an API the situation is opposite
[14:50:49] <W> arahael, I'm going to have to learn Haskell one of these days, just to follow arguments like these :) Java has records too, but they are ordered (because they define an implicit constructor, and constructor arguments are ordered/positional)
[14:50:56] <arahael> W: Ie, myFunc MyFuncArgs{arg1,arg2,arg3} = arg1 + arg2 + arg3; where "MyFuncArgs" is a record that describes all the types myFunc requires.

[14:51:25] <amigojapan> There must be a way to reverse streaminputs. Or you could erase that
[14:51:39] <deniska> W: if you require less from your callers they won't complain, if you provide more to your callers, they also don't complain
[14:51:52] <deniska> complaining begins when you require more or provide less
[14:52:07] <deniska> your proposal means that what you require must be inherently tied to what you provide
[14:52:21] <W> deniska, "complaining" here taking the form of... compiler errors/immediate IDE feedback?
[14:52:22] <deniska> so you can't neither lax the requirements, nor provide more
[14:52:37] <deniska> W: breaking changes
[14:53:03] <W> that wasn't what I was asking, I'm wondering what specific downside you are thinking of here, to the programmer
[14:53:03] <deniska> W: might be compiler error if we're talking compilation units, might be breaking consumers if we're talking HTTP APIs and such
[14:53:23] <amigojapan> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/WJzPATrh
[14:53:58] <W> I would say that, since loosening requirements on what you take in isn't a breaking change, then initially the requirements should be as strict as possible, so you have room for different directions to expand
[14:54:19] <amigojapan> rannnn8888: read that link please
[14:55:02] <W> also, designing code and designing public APIs are _very_ different things, with different likely errors and misunderstandings
[14:55:12] <W> *public web APIs
[14:56:07] <W> backwards compatibility takes on an entirely different weight, to the degree you probably just want to support multiple versions of a schema outright from the get go

[17:18:27] <beaky> yes while loops are bad bro they are a form of general recursion which is too powerful and overkill you gotta instead go for more limited forms of recursion (like for loops) so you can more easily show termination through the decreasing size of the structure
[17:18:38] <W> I use neither; I prefer controlled exit out of scope (over exceptions for control flow, process kill etc), with the loop itself clearly documenting when that happens `while(!userExit){`

[17:22:04] <beaky> yes maybe i should do that instead of usnig too many conditions (or a blank infinite loop) i too often reach for the 'many ways to exit the infinite loop' approach where i use tools like monads or common lisp conditions or exceptions to do adhoc 'identify how i exited and then handle that' processing

[17:26:30] <deniska> I very rarely use something besides `true` in while loops
[17:27:46] <deniska> I guess in languages which have do-while or loop-until style loops, I'd use them more often than while loops
[17:28:18] <deniska> but `while True:` is basically loop-until of languages without that construct
[17:28:35] <W> it's very rare I do use while at all, I'd say, but sometimes you have some kind of active loop, like an interactive command line interface, or lower level networking code (using select and such)
[17:29:14] <beaky> yes like when doing a search i do 'while queue is not empty:' but then often i move such conditions inside an early return in the loop anyway

[20:46:54] <usr123> I've never been able to understand what NP complete means. I tried reading the wikipedia page. Can someone please explain in layman terms what NP complete means? I understand that it's a class of problems where if we can find a solution for one of them, we can find a solution for all of them or something.
[20:52:33] <pyzozord> usr123: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDTOs8MgQfg maybe this will help
[20:54:12] <paulo_> is integer factorization NP complete?
[20:54:18] <pyzozord> I don't understand it well myself. As far as I can understand it's about time complexity of an algorithm and time complexity of a proof of that algorithm. in P O(algo)=O(proof) in NP O(algo) != O(proof)
[20:54:27] <CalimeroTeknik> usr123, that's not the description, that's a property; in layman terms it's a problem where the only way to solve it is trying all possibilities
[20:54:59] <CalimeroTeknik> that's the simplest explanation of NP I can do

[20:57:02] <usr123> CalimeroTeknik: Okay, so it basically means that we don't really have an algorithm for the problem, we just have to try out all possibilities for different parameters and then find the best solution of all the outcomes?
[20:57:33] <CalimeroTeknik> that's the spirit
[20:57:44] <usr123> Got it. Thanks
[20:57:54] <CalimeroTeknik> although there's a raging war of heuristics, as to "in which order do we try them out"?

[20:58:57] <CalimeroTeknik> maybe we won't get the best option, but if we find a good enough one quickly, sometimes that'll suffice in practice
[20:59:24] <CalimeroTeknik> of course this means stopping before actually solving the problem
[20:59:37] <CalimeroTeknik> close enough does it

[22:13:12] <blahboybaz> I'm seeing something wierd with jest that doesn't seem to match the usage according to the documentation. Jest has a function toBeNull()  ( see: https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tobenull ). In the example the usage shows it being used like a function ( ie: with the parenthesis at the end "()" ). However, when I try to use it like that I get an error. If I try to use toBe(null) I also get an error.
[22:13:18] <blahboybaz> But if I use toBeNull  ( without the parens ) it passes. What could be going on here?

[22:23:52] <pyzozord> it's just a failed expectation, obj is not "null", it is "undefined". In javascript those are two different values
[22:24:03] <blahboybaz> I know with certainty that that field is initialized to null. Manual testing proves it but I can't seem to test it in jest

[22:25:46] <blahboybaz> If I do let obj = new Node(); console.log(obj.data); and just run it manually (not a jest test) I get the output "null".
[22:26:44] <pyzozord> ah, it may be about the mock. remove line 5 and check again
[22:27:29] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: I'm guess you mean in the jest test file so if I place that line obove me exepect line I get  debug undefined by jesst output
[22:28:25] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: oh ok well in that case obj.data is not null, it is undefined and the expect().toBeNull() fails correctly

[22:31:27] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: I get  debug Node {}

[22:34:28] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: yeah so it's the mock
[22:34:56] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: generally it looks like your test is testing the Node, in that case you don't want to mock the node

[22:38:16] <pyzozord> ok I looked again there are two more things wrong
[22:38:41] <pyzozord> irst, your variable name is not "data", it's "_data".
[22:39:00] <pyzozord> I don't know what I did but I did something werid...
[22:39:40] <pyzozord> First, your variable name is not "data", it's "_data".
[22:40:16] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: Even if I eliminate the beforeEach block, do let node = new Node(); in the scope of define, then change the case of Node to node (what should be the instantiated object) in all the test lines - now all my previously passing tests (the first 3) all fail. If I comment all tests excetp that last one (the one with toBeNull() in it then it passes but it is the only one. I need to be able to
[22:40:20] <pyzozord> Second, you are using # which indicates that variable or function is private to the class. That means it will be completly invisible outside, like for example in your test
[22:40:22] <blahboybaz> test all these things (all the test cases that were being done.
[22:41:13] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: it #_data (private field) has a getter and setter which ar accessed with obj.data or obj.data(value) respectively.
[22:41:38] <blahboybaz> So the getter and setter should be getting used. Manual testing shows everything to work fine
[22:42:13] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: oh you are right, sorry haven't been reading it very closely
[22:43:36] <blahboybaz> Its like I have a problem if I go one way and a different problem if I go the other way and can't get a valid test with all tests included
[22:43:56] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: have you looked at the example here? https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname-accesstype

[23:11:19] <kosek> software developer need to feel fire under (_/_) otherweiss they start to be lazy thats why mobbing is a good way for more efficient

[23:19:42] <pyzozord> alycidyne: from my leymen perspective, I'd say that yes, conceptually operating systems role is to define and enforce responsibilities, and privilages for programs so that they can run and do it together harmoniously

[23:24:14] <alycidyne> A pattern is something unnatural - it requires memory, which, as we see, is not always necessary in nature

[23:55:58] <recursiveNode> pavelow The reason is you might want to do research. In that case, instead of looking up accurate information from peer-reviewed journals, like seminal papers that are extremely scrutinized by experts from the field. Instead of those, you will be reading generally agreeable text from wikipedia. From that text, you cannot accurately do research because it is far from the original research papers. As a result, you miss
[23:55:58] <recursiveNode> the actual peer-reviewed definitions of concepts, and you miss the peer-reviewed "what,how,why,etc." of the subjects. While wikipedia explanations are agreeable, they do not lead to understanding concepts very well. Only research papers create that deep, expert understanding. (I've learned this experimentally)
