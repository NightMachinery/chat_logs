[00:00:04] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!

[01:02:22] <Hunterkll> Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia are on the table
[01:02:35] <Hunterkll> that's taking out the easy ones, and the no-front-plate states
[01:02:45] <Hunterkll> oh, it could also be washington DC
[01:02:49] <Hunterkll> they have mostly white plates too 
[01:02:50] <technonerd> that trucks gunna back up
[01:02:56] <DrGibby> was going to say, DC too
[01:03:12] <Hunterkll> okay
[01:03:18] <Hunterkll> VA is a contender, also mostly white with blue lettering
[01:03:52] <Hunterkll> Maine is also somewhat mostly white, but green bird on the left side and forestry on the bottom
[01:04:03] <DrGibby> fuck all these drivers are morons
[01:04:23] <bloody> must be maryland then
[01:04:41] <Hunterkll> Massachusettes real ify. Seems they're mostly white background, but RED font

[01:05:46] <DrGibby> other than white
[01:05:51] <DrGibby> or, white-ish
[01:05:59] <Hunterkll> yea, which is making me think black text
[01:06:06] <Hunterkll> which would blend in well at this res
[01:07:22] <Hunterkll> so most likely... MAryland, Rhode Island (questionable, but more likely than Maine/Massachusetts), Virginia, or DC .... but i'll take virginia out, because you'd see at least some yellow plates if it was VA 
[01:07:46] <DrGibby> there were yellow plates on a van that drove by a min ago

[02:04:05] <teh_f4ll3n> :D
[02:04:45] <nobyk> It's just a very simple line but it's confusing
[02:05:00] <nobyk> It's basically a vlookup, with 2 CSV files

[02:09:55] <Kiernian> That's what I'm trying to figure out. Hey, thanks Hotmess, that'll do everything I need
[02:10:27] <Hunterkll> yea, bceause that doesn't apply if it's an actual RDS setup with user profile disks, for example, and there's a few other ways things can be set too that aren't directly obvious
[02:10:30] <Kiernian> this is an old server that's only serving up domain anything to a few outdated, isolated items and technically shouldn't be in production.
[02:10:41] <Kiernian> it looks like a team of morons set it up
[02:10:44] <Hunterkll> like, if it's just redirection, it's probably storing user folders in a share somewhere....
[02:10:51] <Hunterkll> roaming profiles, different story....

[12:33:21] <A-KO> I just learned that you can use Issuance Policies in ADCS to assign group membership *when a user logs in with a certificate with that policy applied to it*
[12:33:21] *** Quits: seednode (~seednode@user/seednode) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:33:32] <A-KO> as in, you can say, "if smart card, the user ALSO gets X group added to their Kerberos token"
[12:33:37] <A-KO> this was apparently added in *2008*
[12:33:41] *** Joins: seednode (~seednode@user/seednode)
[12:33:50] <A-KO> to do something called "Authentication Method Assurance"
[12:35:17] <A-KO> even better, it's really just an AD thing
[12:35:28] <A-KO> so you just have to create an OID, stamp it in AD, and AD handles doing this for you
[12:35:37] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> Ah, so you can configure remote access to have additional security levels when they're using additional authentication methods?
[12:35:43] <A-KO> yes
[12:35:52] <A-KO> but even aside from remote access, you can do this for file shares
[12:36:09] <A-KO> just create some super secret file share and stamp that group's ACL on it
[12:36:19] <A-KO> "You get modify access if you have this security gruop in your PAC, but otherwise read access"
[12:36:32] <A-KO> and that security group can be tied to an OID on the certificate

[12:36:47] <A-KO> nobody understands Microsoft
[12:37:01] <A-KO> I'm not sure you can do it via remote access (i.e. RDP)--I could be wrong.
[12:37:07] <A-KO> but for any kind of TGS processing?
[12:37:08] <A-KO> sure
[12:37:16] <A-KO> I haven't tested how far you can go with it yet
[12:38:08] <A-KO> there are a couple of different ways to attest to things really, one of them is "implicit" attestation
[12:38:25] <A-KO> that is the assumption that you've configured your environment in such a way that it's *impossible* to authenticate as X without meeting Y conditions.
[12:38:34] <A-KO> without any technical controls to validate that
[12:38:54] <A-KO> then there's explicit attestation, which is--you attest the claims that the authentication request is making
[12:40:30] <A-KO> This is where something like Authentication Policy Silos are useful rather than the GPO that says "Deny Interactive Logon" or w/e the policy is.

[12:41:47] <A-KO> but nobody uses them because they are rather confusing to set up
[12:41:52] <A-KO> because you have silos and policies
[12:41:55] <A-KO> which are kind of.....
[12:41:58] <A-KO> they're intertwined

[18:26:17] <monr0e> PattyCakes: Get a wall-mounted fan. All your houses are built out of paper anyway, won't be too hard to mount
[18:26:18] <PublicWifi> you'd prolly need a LOT of water and a really tall tower
[18:26:21] <SirSceptalot> your air then cools down in your tank, lowering the pressure
[18:26:35] <PublicWifi> yeah and as it decompresses it cools more
[18:26:37] <PublicWifi> hmm
[18:26:41] <monr0e> Also what the fuck is with that ceiling
[18:26:45] <vinrock> you also need to take into consideration condensation inside the tank building up
[18:26:49] <vinrock> air tanks need to be drained
[18:26:52] <SirSceptalot> then when releasing the pressure, that cools your equipment, possibly to the point where you need to heat the equipment to prevent it from locking up or whatever

[23:17:32] <vinrock> ew
[23:17:34] <vinrock> i hate training
[23:17:35] <lfa> seriously tho its just dumb
[23:17:45] <PublicWifi> fritzwastaken: your trainy wainy made me sticky wicky uwu
[23:17:55] <lfa> i cant be enthusiastic about this crap, i fucking hate doing it the point where im considering looking for a new job
[23:18:00] * fritzwastaken looks around for mods
[23:18:00] <lfa> and he wants us to do 1 every month
[23:18:02] <fritzwastaken> uwuuuu
[23:18:14] <PublicWifi> UwU or uwu
[23:18:16] <PublicWifi> let's discuss
[23:18:25] <fritzwastaken> uWu
[23:18:30] <PublicWifi> i agree
[23:18:36] <PublicWifi> s/i agree/i agree uwu
[23:18:38] <layer8> PublicWifi meant: "i agree uwu"
[23:18:46] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I did training sessions on all the components of M365 because mostly I don't want to have to administer a dumpster fire of Sharepoint sites when they just treat it like a fileshare
[23:19:07] <PublicWifi> just throw it all in onedrive
[23:19:09] <sd> 14<K​illnine> And for teams because I want them to actually use it
[23:19:12] <PublicWifi> that's the proper thing to do amirite
[23:19:20] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yeah, just put everything on OneDrive and make 5000 share links
[23:19:24] <PublicWifi> ^
[23:19:26] <PublicWifi> yes
[23:19:28] <lfa> also 
[23:19:28] <PublicWifi> this is the way
[23:19:32] <lfa> i got criticized for too many slides
[23:19:40] <lfa> saying i should make it more condensed instead of having short slides
[23:19:47] <lfa> i thought it was the opposite tho
[23:19:55] <PublicWifi> wait what were you doing again
[23:19:57] <PublicWifi> training? lol
[23:19:57] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Just a suggestion....I do Teams presentations for my training, record it and then throw it on Stream
[23:20:03] <lfa> training presentation for end-user 
[23:20:04] <sd> 14<K​illnine> so that way if people miss, they can see what we did
[23:20:18] <lfa> yeah i have to do a teams presentation but also do it live 
[23:20:21] <sd> 14<K​illnine> And I dont have to fight 50 people's schedules or do make-up classes
[23:20:25] <PublicWifi> rip
[23:20:29] <lfa> it has to be recorded too lol
[23:20:44] <lfa> dude 1 every month is way too excessive
[23:20:53] <lfa> its like we're doing them for the sake of doing them
[23:20:57] <sd> 14<K​illnine> You can make a meeting with yourself and do a 'golden run' for recording and then do a live session where everything explodes
[23:21:14] <sd> 14<K​illnine> But that's a lot of time and prep
[23:21:16] <lfa> i just really fucking hate doing these
[23:21:31] <lfa> if it was some presentation to management to buy some product I'd understand
[23:21:42] <lfa> or if we rolled out some new product and we want end-users to know how to use them
[23:21:44] <fritzwastaken> Outsource it
[23:21:54] <lfa> cant cause our manager wants us do to them
[23:21:58] <lfa> it seems he likes to do them
[23:22:04] <lfa> and thats why he wants us to do them too
[23:22:21] <lfa> i dont think he realizes how much me and my coworker detests this
[23:22:22] <PublicWifi> do what I do
[23:22:25] <PublicWifi> shit your pants live
[23:22:34] <PublicWifi> never train people again
[23:22:58] <lfa> i want to do that
[23:23:09] <lfa> dude this isnt a sysadmin job to train users like this smh

[23:27:12] <vinrock> ca caw

[23:28:42] <lfa> yep
[23:28:51] <lfa> dude ur average user is not gonna give a shit about the training
[23:29:02] <lfa> they prolly gonna join, have it on mute in some tab, then work

[23:31:17] <lfa> the fact that im not enthusiastic about doing something I hate doing
