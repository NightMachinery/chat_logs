[01:34:07] <mrig> or use postfix grammar.

[04:21:13] <Izem> I wonder if this was the inspiration behind the unix philosophy :P
[04:21:15] <arahael> JanC: consider that you can (often!) modify the way the application libraries are dynamically linked in at launch.
[04:21:15] <JanC> arahael: e.g. often users have read/write access to their own home directory, but not execute rights to them; "executable" configuration files can work around that
[04:21:48] <arahael> JanC: and if you load the application with a custom ld preload configuration instead?
[04:22:01] <arahael> JanC: or even in a debugger!
[04:22:04] <JanC> that's not always possible, of course
[04:22:12] <arahael> almost always.
[04:23:25] <arahael> JanC: what you seem to be after is having applications sandboxed in a container that the user does *not* have control over.  eg, as is often the case on iOS.
[04:23:33] <JanC> but e.g. a common way to trick users into such preloading is to abuse the fact that bash/sh uses configuration scripts  :)
[04:24:36] <arahael> JanC: this isn't a bash/sh thing.
[04:24:46] <JanC> it's just an example
[04:27:09] <arahael> well, unless you want to solve the real gaping wide issue you are pointing out, the tiny, minor issue of allowing configuration files to have code in them is a tiny smidge.
[04:28:14] <arahael> and to solve the gaping wide issue, you need to use something more like ios, deny access to configuration files *entirely*, and sandbox with an environment that is not in the user's control.
[04:28:46] <JanC> I was just pointing out it was _potentially_ a security risk

[04:30:01] <arahael> and i was pointing out that - assuming it is, there are far bigger manifestations to deal with first.
[04:30:12] <JanC> and even when using a sandbox, being able modify the code run for configuration increases the risk that you can exploit a vulnerability
[04:30:18] <arahael> you don't fine people for littering in the middle of a riot.
[04:30:35] <arahael> JanC: right, which is why you remove that ability...

[04:34:04] <JanC> so when your application doesn't need executable code for configuration, then don't use it--it removes one layer of potential problems  :)
[04:34:30] <arahael> JanC: not really because it still uses executable code for configuration, even if you can't see it.

[04:47:39] <arahael> very often thats how it is presented, and i dont think it is a potential issue at all in the contexts of most desktop applications (unless, again, the application escalates itself, which is an insane thing to be able to do).

[07:59:03] <Quietwalker> "... fix this with <x> and you can expect to see a 4% yield increase, maybe more on edge die."
[07:59:04] <Izem> Quietwalker is there an army off people writing docs for the chips?
[07:59:17] <mnrmnaugh> pretty good Quietwalker 
[07:59:18] <Quietwalker> and it usually worked, we'd get a good sale, everyone was happy.
[07:59:22] <Quietwalker> 4% increase is a lot
[07:59:22] <Izem> nice
[07:59:26] <Quietwalker> oh
[07:59:31] <mnrmnaugh> ye esp these days
[08:00:06] <mnrmnaugh> well i assume... 4% is more 2005 shit
[08:00:08] <Quietwalker> 1 time we were able to say "Hey, whenever employee 12345 is using inspection machine XXXX, the entire lot takes like a 3-8% hit. It's so severe, I'm surprised you guys didn't notice it yourself, but it looks like he only signs on to that machine on wed-friday?"
[08:00:38] <Izem> rip
[08:00:39] <mnrmnaugh> lmao
[08:00:39] <Quietwalker> basically, we were able to tell this one guy was fucking everything up and had been for months because he didn't follow proper policy for hand-carry lots for a certain machine and was scratching the wafers up to hell.
[08:00:43] <Quietwalker> anyway ...
[08:01:01] <Quietwalker> we go to TSMC, and well, they are taiwan, but they behave like any other chinese company.
[08:01:47] <Quietwalker> This means ... hmm.. how do I say it?  The attitude there is something like "If it was stolen, then as the owner, you ALLOWED it to be stolen, therefore you are at fault, and not the thief who took your property."
[08:02:03] <Quietwalker> corporate espionage is real big there, especially vs. non-chinese companies.
[08:02:08] <Izem> interesting
[08:02:22] <Quietwalker> so we go in and they let us in just fine, check our machines, cell phones, etc.

[08:06:20] <Quietwalker> and yeah, we have to start the thing over.
[08:06:25] <Izem> wow
[08:06:27] <Quietwalker> so they took the hard drive out to make a copy
[08:06:29] <mnrmnaugh> what the actual fuck
[08:06:45] <Izem> wouldn't that break it?
[08:06:58] <Quietwalker> okay, hard drive is encrypted, plus we cpu-locked our software, it's built in, uses cpu identifiers for some of it's runtime.

[08:07:55] <Quietwalker> the guy who was very angry with us a lot, but wanted us to show things - basically a middle manager, but one with actual engineering chops, he knew what he was doing ...
[08:08:02] <Quietwalker> he actually stripped the data he gave us
[08:08:08] <Quietwalker> said it was too sensitive
[08:08:16] <Quietwalker> so he removed all the variable names... er...
[08:08:17] <mnrmnaugh> oh not bad at all
[08:08:36] <Quietwalker> so for the prediction I'm talking about ...
[08:08:41] <Quietwalker> given 2 variables ...
[08:08:44] <Quietwalker> you can make a plot right?
[08:08:53] <Quietwalker> and you can extrapolate how it's going to keep going
[08:09:01] <mnrmnaugh> ayyyyyyyyyy
[08:09:27] <Quietwalker> even if it's a curve or iterating frequency, or exponential or linear or whatever.
[08:09:36] <Quietwalker> okay
[08:09:59] <Quietwalker> and if you have 3 variables, well, first, they might not interact with each other directly, but if they do, you can still plot it
[08:09:59] <mnrmnaugh> damn, speaking maths, i met a lovely person the other day
[08:10:20] <mnrmnaugh> ... i can do vector calc in head
[08:10:21] <Quietwalker> but you could end up with like, 2 relationships :  X, Y,  and Y, Z, but X and Z are not directly related.
[08:10:24] <Quietwalker> okay
[08:10:48] <Quietwalker> well this was something like 2000x2000 variable comparisons, looking for all possible sets of all possible combinations of all relationships.
[08:10:57] <Quietwalker> and usually we can use those expert systems to pare things down
[08:11:07] <mnrmnaugh> not the ... at you, mearly the sigh at this kapitalisti nej pruch
[08:11:11] <Quietwalker> like, we don't need to know that the "time" value always seems to be increasing linearly and sequentally
[08:11:12] <Izem> is this related to interpolation?
[08:11:22] <Quietwalker> that's not a useful relationship we care about
[08:11:27] <Izem> oh ok
[08:11:32] <Quietwalker> but this guy took all the names off all the data
[08:11:47] <Quietwalker> so we didn't know if it was a voltage reading or resistance or just a pass/fail e-test
[08:11:57] <Quietwalker> we could still tell, of course, but it was more work
[08:11:59] <mnrmnaugh> ah damn
[08:12:12] <Quietwalker> things like voltage on a resistor follows an inverse exponential line, etc
[08:12:25] <mnrmnaugh> aye
[08:12:27] <Quietwalker> so we can identify what's going on, but it's like 1 layer of abstraction

[08:13:32] <webnet4> a ceremony!
[08:13:35] <Quietwalker> He shows the data he has, explains he's already found what we have, here it is, here's the trends that will fix problems, and this company is not needed at all
[08:13:48] <Izem> wow

[08:14:18] <Quietwalker> also, there were a bunch of folks on the side who didn't seem to be doing anything, just standing up against the wall, sort of watching him, like his subordinates, clearly they were not associated with the much bigger wigs in this meeting.

[08:15:21] <Quietwalker> so our folks step up, and show that even though he obfuscated the data, we found these other trends, they were much better, much more obvious (once detected), had higher confidence and better return, and we ran his in the background and his were like below 20% confidence - basically he was wrong.
[08:15:33] <Quietwalker> and when we put the labels back on, yes it was pretty straightforward.
[08:15:48] <Quietwalker> (and most of the folks in the meeting were bigwigs, but also engineers, so they knew what they were seeing)
[08:15:57] <Quietwalker> so we made a very, very good impression.
[08:16:07] <Quietwalker> and the guy felt like he lost face or something

[08:20:10] <Quietwalker> pretty sure he had made promises to that guy he could no longer keep.

[08:20:33] <Quietwalker> and we never worked with that guy again though we did have a very short term contract with them
[08:20:45] <Quietwalker> as far as we know, he was no longer employed the next time we dealt with them
[08:21:00] <Izem> wow
[08:21:22] <mnrmnaugh> Quietwalker speaking of absolute offtopic, i wonder what people will think when i wear my uncles service jacket this winter
[08:21:25] <Quietwalker> basically, he failed to rip us off, and therefore, HE was at fault for failing to steal things, and probably m ore than that, we made him look bad, and he had clearly promised something to that room of bigwigs he could not deliver, which made HIS boss look bad.
[08:21:39] <mnrmnaugh> lmao failing to steal
[08:21:42] <Quietwalker> mnrmnaugh: uhm,  I dunno, just don't try to do the whole stolen valor thing.
[08:22:04] <mnrmnaugh> I WILL FUCKING KILL PEOPLE OVER STOLEN VALOR
[08:22:36] <mnrmnaugh> no i had to stitch my grandfathers ribbons into my lid to try to tell people rto fuck off about it
[08:22:45] <Quietwalker> so anyway, we had made him lose face after he ran a very aggressive campaign against us, and that probably made his boss or whomever backed him look bad enough - especially after he tried to sabotage our demo and just made him look stupid - that he had to suffer for it.
[08:22:50] <mnrmnaugh> if you do not know these ribbons
[08:23:34] <Quietwalker> On the other hand, I went to a really nice dim sum place, and the wonderful ladies working in the kitchen were so excited to see me genuinely enjoy their cooking that they kept sending me free food and sent me back to the hotel with like, 2 kilos of takeout.

[08:39:18] <mnrmnaugh> i swear to my bible smoking cured my asthma
[08:39:19] <Quietwalker> or I did whatever it was, was the exercise, harder and more than anyone else.

[08:45:28] <Quietwalker> one night in college, I woke up in the middle of the night, and I could instantly tell someone was in my (locked) room with me.
[08:45:37] <Quietwalker> like, the air moved differently or something.
[08:45:43] <mnrmnaugh> InPhase i cant help it....
[08:45:54] <InPhase> mnrmnaugh: Well, figure out how to help it.
[08:46:09] <Quietwalker> and something triggered my fight or flight instinct so I knew it was something like I was going to be bashed over the head or something.
[08:46:18] <InPhase> mnrmnaugh: On the topic of conversation, smoking can increase your stroke risk by a factor of 6 or so.  That's pretty gigantic, so you might want to tweak that if you're no stroke #4.
[08:46:31] <InPhase> s/no stroke/on stroke/
[08:46:35] <Quietwalker> so I rolled out of bed onto the floor, and I saw movement right in front of my room door
[08:46:47] <Izem> was it a cat? 
[08:46:49] <mnrmnaugh> InPhase like, writing is an expression to me, and i have been cursed at for something as simple as a few words on a page as opposed to an actual insult all my life
[08:46:53] <Quietwalker> and like I said, fight or flight.  Basically I rolled into a sort of sprinter starting position, ...
[08:46:55] <Quietwalker> and no, it was human sized
[08:47:00] <Izem> oh D:
[08:47:02] <Quietwalker> I mean it was a shadow, I couldn't see who it was
[08:47:11] <Quietwalker> but they got into my room, which had been locked

[08:47:59] <Quietwalker> slammed head first into the mirror on the back of the door. Really flippin' hurt.  Good thing it was one of those cheap plastic mirrors.
[08:48:07] <Quietwalker> Anyway, that's a night I won't forget either.
[08:48:25] <Izem> oh man, so nothing was there? xD
[08:48:26] <vdamewood> Hmm... I was guessing blow-up doll.

[08:49:30] <Quietwalker> maybe I was having a bad dream or an aggressive dream.  I used to have a lot of dynasty-warrior style "fighting 100 people at a time" dreams and I'd wake up from the adrenaline.
[08:49:30] <vdamewood> "I'm in danger."

[08:52:48] <vdamewood> I woke up.

[08:57:43] <webnet4> erase job from the equation,  know how is not enough to complete a programming project
[08:57:52] <Quietwalker> well, I mean, they're a programmer. They were hired to write code.  And they just did a bunch of jobs they're not necessarily qualified for.  They just replaced the product and project managers - determining what requirements should be, and whether company time and money should be spent on each feature.
[08:58:08] <Izem> oh I see
[08:58:26] <Quietwalker> They replaced the security and qa folks who might have specific gates they expect to jump through.  There's almost certainly a massive raft of NFRs they didn't provide.  They've likely exposed their company to possible legal ramifications because they didn't go through legal
[08:58:30] <Izem> that's how that works

[08:58:55] <juliaEnv> Izem yes, pinpointing a cause to an effect can be important. But the know why in science means something deeper. It means knowing the scientific theory or mathematical model beyond the observed phenomenon.
[08:59:05] <InPhase> juliaEnv: If you read it carefully you'll see a lot more required than just know-how.
[08:59:20] <Quietwalker> where's the support training? the maintenance policy? Did you pay for any libraries or licenses?  How are you going to support this? How can sales sell it if it's already released? DId you set up a pipeline?

[09:00:07] <Izem> InPhase: btw what is a year experience?
[09:00:27] <Izem> literally 12 months of work?
[09:00:30] <Quietwalker> The short version is, they're spending company time and using company equipment to work on things that folks with a better idea of what's good for the company have not authorized him to do so, and did so in a way that makes it hard to maintain or sell, may violate policy or laws, and could negatively disrupt their business operations.

[09:02:22] <Quietwalker> so, code ninjas = bad ROI
[09:02:24] <juliaEnv> Izem well, I believe if the subject is computation then the background scientific theory is how computation works
[09:02:28] <Izem> yeah, that's corporate for sure

[09:02:52] <Quietwalker> join toastmakers or something
[09:03:01] <Quietwalker> that's the best way to boost your interviews and careers
[09:03:20] <Izem> juliaEnv computation includes semiconductors so you will have to narrow it :P
[09:03:23] <juliaEnv> Izem what is the subject? It can be as specific as a specific command, or framework, or a broad one. But every subject has a scientific theory (background theory) or a mathematical model.
[09:03:42] <Quietwalker> your know-how is only good for like 20% of your day-to-day. The rest will be domain knowledge you can't have known without doing that specific job before.
[09:03:52] <juliaEnv> Izem by subject, I mean a problem instance.
[09:03:54] <InPhase> Izem: Sometimes you'll be up against an HR department filter that counts durations.  If your application is being filtered by another programmer, they're typically going to look for examples of actual programs rather than focus on counting years at places.
[09:04:32] <Quietwalker> using in-house libraries or systems, wrapping code around existing data objects or policies.  I mean, I learned all about building IC chips at one job, and the next was like, banking transfers and finance.
[09:04:53] <Izem> interesting
[09:04:58] <Quietwalker> Izem: Oh, yeah, a good thing to note is that the application process is in multiple steps.
[09:05:35] <Izem> InPhase: do programmers look for projects first?
[09:05:37] <Quietwalker> Izem: Usually they have an HR filter - a person or a computer filter - that checks your resume for keywords and years of use.  This is the top level filter you have to get past.  A person might go deeper and try to find their buzzwords in your job descriptions.
[09:05:45] <Quietwalker> that's just phase one
[09:06:05] <Quietwalker> then they do a call, they might ask you some technical questions, but this is all just drone work, seeing if you pass the minimum bar to get an in-person
[09:06:10] <juliaEnv> Izem when you're solving a problem instance with your know-how, you know how to solve that problem instance. (knowing how). But if you also know why that solution works (the scientific theory behind it) then that's science
[09:06:19] <Quietwalker> and somewhere in there, you'll get a real engineer, and might get good interview questions
[09:06:46] <Quietwalker> so I recommend that you rewrite your resume every time you apply to a job to use the exact buzzwords and years of use of technology that the job posting says is required.
[09:07:11] <Izem> heh if I had to do a test right now I could not do a nary tree, but I could do a trie

[09:07:26] <Quietwalker> even if you don't have the requirements, find a way to add them in.  It's just a stupid mechanical barrier.
[09:07:53] <Quietwalker> and once you get to the in person, find something about you that makes you stand out.  Realize that you're competing with other people who probably have the exact same skills; they went through that same gate too.
[09:08:04] <InPhase> Izem: I might have a first-pass filtering of some basic must-have requirements.  For example, that application required 4 lines of Python solving a 2 minute problem submitted with the application.  If you didn't read the application closely enough to see that, or can't solve that, why do I want to take time to interview you?  ;)  But beyond that, projects written or worked on are almost always the 
[09:08:05] <Quietwalker> so don't compete on technical ability or projects or things like that unless you're really an expert
[09:08:10] <InPhase> first thing I look for in a programmer.
[09:09:14] <Quietwalker> just try to be personable and memorable. Make them talk about themselves and the job and the company rather than be passive and ask you questions.  It's not to show interest in the job. Psychologically, people feel more friendly to folks who seem to want to know about them.  Use that to your advantage.
[09:09:18] <Izem> thanks for the advice
[09:09:20] <Quietwalker> :)
[09:09:56] <Quietwalker> I think there's only been 2 jobs I've ever applied for that really had me demo a pre-existing project or do a really full featured "go back and write an app and bring it to us tomorrow" type of application
[09:10:18] <Izem> resumes give me terrible anxiety now though, I'm going back to school instead

[09:16:20] <arahael> Quietwalker: None of the recruiters got the memo that when they hire someone, that candidate needs to interview *them* to see if they even want to work there.
[09:16:26] <Quietwalker> yeah
[09:16:35] <Quietwalker> most applicants forget that an interview is two ways
[09:16:57] <InPhase> arahael: Many times recruiters don't actually know the workplace culture in the target team.
[09:17:06] <Quietwalker> they still think it's like ... the 50's.  With the flintstones style employment. Where your boss yells at you and can force you to host him for dinner, and you have to grovel just to keep your job even if you're doing it well enough.
[09:17:25] <Quietwalker> the interview is the time for the company to impress the applicant, and vice versa.
[09:17:32] <Quietwalker> Google does a good job on this front.
[09:17:46] <Quietwalker> microsoft too, at least if you get invited for a senior enough position.
[09:18:00] <Izem> usually it seems you don't get the rules to the game
[09:18:00] <juliaEnv> InPhase I've seen ambitious, coordinate, plan, team work, etc. These are non technical skills. At the same time, these are procedural knowledge (know-how to coordinate, know how to be seen as willing to succeed, know how to plan, know how to work in a team, etc.).
[09:18:09] <webnet4> two companies we'd be better off without
[09:18:26] <Quietwalker> amazon on the other hand, you're a <foul-word>-sandwich and they sorta let you know it up front. You'll be gone in 2-3 years anyway, so no one cares.
[09:18:37] <Izem> wow
[09:19:04] <InPhase> Quietwalker: Yeah.  I always start phone screening with talking about my team, the projects, and the vision, before I ask a single question.  It's a two-way sales pitch for the good candidates.
[09:19:31] <Quietwalker> Yeah, one thing I think schools should start focusing on is the entire SLDC rather than just the programming part.  Though technically CS is a theoretical skill, vs being a programmer which is an applied skill.  Like being a physicist vs being a mechanic.
[09:20:05] <Izem> SLDC?
[09:20:17] <Quietwalker> InPhase: I haven't seen many people put a lot of effort into the phone screenings, but I guess for the last 2 years it's probably effectively all remote screening.
[09:20:27] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Know how to answer why questions, know how to answer what questions?  You're drifting into a semantic game there I think.  :)
[09:20:27] <Quietwalker> sorry, SDLC. Software development life cycle
[09:20:31] <arahael> InPhase: Yes, but this particular recruiter was bragging how they started a new company, etc.
[09:20:42] <webnet4> mechanics follow procedures, programmers write procedures
[09:20:48] <arahael> InPhase: But it seems they were just ego-buffing themselves, and weren't expecting to actually answer questions about it.

[09:22:11] <Izem> then again, school is not supposed to be training ;)
[09:22:23] <Quietwalker> Here's an easy interview question: As a programmer, what is your #1 job responsiblity?
[09:22:28] <InPhase> juliaEnv: That's not the way I would mentally model these things, but by the Searle's Chinese Room, all human behavior could be consider a procedure.  This is a philosophical debate about how to describe the inner mind.
[09:22:36] <Quietwalker> (only with responsibility spelled correctly)
[09:22:40] <juliaEnv> there is also know-that (descriptive knowledge that can be applied to a task)
[09:22:42] <InPhase> s/consider/considered/
[09:23:11] <Quietwalker> and I'll cut you off if you were going to answer.  The #1 job responsibility is to create value for the company, hopefully more than they pay you.
[09:23:18] <juliaEnv> InPhase procedures are learned by doing them, when having some goal.
[09:23:31] <Quietwalker> it's not to write perfect code or fix bugs. It's to make money.

[09:24:06] <juliaEnv> InPhase so when you have a goal and you need someone who knows how to do it, that's a procedural knowledge
[09:24:31] <Quietwalker> lots of folks forget that. They're like, "Let's bring in this new programming language no one has used in our company yet! Let's write it in that!" "Yeah, okay, but, won't it take longer, be less secure, be more buggy, have less support, and exist outside of our core expertise?"
[09:24:49] <juliaEnv> InPhase if you instead needed someone who knows why something works the way it works, that's a know-why (scientific knowledge)
[09:25:58] <juliaEnv> InPhase and if you instead needed someone with facts about a thing without necessarily knowing how to achieve a goal, that's a know-that (X is this, X is that, X relates to Y, ...)
[09:26:21] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Imagine a nursing position posting puts, "Compassionate bedside manner" as a job requirement.  You could try to argue this is a procedural requirement regarding sets of words and facial expressions and mannerisms of moving the body...  This is a Searle Chinese Room argument.  But, this is not how most people model this concept.
[09:27:03] <Quietwalker> anyway, folks without awareness of the full SDLC or the corporate environment that the software engineering jobs exist in has the potential to make, well, really poor decisions without that awareness, and for some reason, they often are allowed to because folks still think programmers are rock stars somehow.

[09:29:38] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Here's the problem.  Most people who attempt to approach "compassionate bedside manner" as a set of procedures are going to come across as artificial and scripted, and weird out patients.

[09:33:50] <juliaEnv> InPhase that's a hypothesis that needs to be tested. It's not a result of a valid experiment (i.e. of a controlled study) where participants would be learning how to project compassion in the context of bedside, and they would be put int a double blind study based on who learns bedside procedures while consciously knowing they are procedures, and who learns them without consciously knowing that they are procedures.

[12:03:56] <CuriousErnestBro> the front-end is a mobile app, so it'll be valid forever

[12:07:12] <CuriousErnestBro> piou because it's not needed: I won't be invalidating sessions, ever
[12:07:33] <piou> deniska: I'd say the whole point of JWT is that any server can verify its origin without storing the secret to produce them allowing for multi-domain architectures
[12:07:42] <CuriousErnestBro> front end is iOS app, so I don't have to worry about random javascript stealing my JWT
[12:07:52] <piou> JWT are generally very much a secret

[12:08:10] <CuriousErnestBro> someone in #webdev told me that JWT's can be stolen by CDN scripts etc. 
[12:08:18] <deniska> piou: JWT as a whole is a secret, its payload shouldn't be considered a secret
[12:08:42] <deniska> if you want to use jwt for auth, you put username or userid or whatever inside it
[12:08:45] <CuriousErnestBro> the only thing JWT does is verify that I made it
[12:09:01] <piou> deniska: depends who you're trying to keep it secret from. It shouldn't be a secret for the user that's sure

[12:09:47] <CuriousErnestBro> piou exactly. I could just store plaintext password and send it through authentication header 
[12:09:53] <CuriousErnestBro> who cares
[12:10:00] <piou> Errrrr
[12:10:04] <deniska> http basic auth works that way
[12:10:07] <CuriousErnestBro> but people have a knee jerk reaction to that
[12:10:18] <piou> The "storing plaintext password" is the part that I don't like

[12:10:42] <CuriousErnestBro> yes

[12:11:05] <piou> But I guess that's essentially what you're doing with your non-expiring jwt (which I still don't feel good about)
[12:11:11] <deniska> CuriousErnestBro: basically use http basic auth and don't reinvent the wheel

[12:11:19] <CuriousErnestBro> exactly. so why pretend to be sophisticated
[12:11:50] <deniska> Also why do I always read the j in "jwt" as java?
[12:11:52] <CuriousErnestBro> deniska good idea tbh, idk why I didn't think of that: probably because I associate http basic auth with the annoying little box at the top 
[12:12:07] <CuriousErnestBro> didn't know you could use it in API's but in hindsight that's obvious
[12:12:23] <CuriousErnestBro> deniska it's Jason, he made it :^)
[12:12:25] <deniska> Also j in jwt technically does mean "java"
[12:12:29] <piou> I just don't get the point of not expiring them... Renewing them regularly when people use the application, sure, but if you don't use the application for a month is it really unreasonnable to expect the user to log in?

[12:12:57] <CuriousErnestBro> piou it absolutely is. I'm not logged out of instagram after not opening the app for a month
[12:13:02] <CuriousErnestBro> we're talking about mobile apps here
[12:13:30] <piou> I know, and I much prefer the apps that do log me out
[12:13:52] <CuriousErnestBro> nearly all don't, because that's "friction" as the cool kids say
[12:14:27] <piou> I think many cool kids just log too often in their apps to notice
[12:15:16] <piou> I won't go into that debate again, it's manageable, but it does leave a sour taste that I won't shake off.
[12:16:06] <CuriousErnestBro> sure, my point however is that never-expiring tokens is just dancing around the problem
[12:16:17] <CuriousErnestBro> don't be a weakling and accept reality :^) 
[12:16:39] <CuriousErnestBro> not aimed at you, but the entire industry in general :D
[12:17:05] <piou> Oh no, I certainly don't want to shake that feeling off, having red flags is important to know when something is on the edge
[12:17:18] <CuriousErnestBro> I agree
[12:17:40] <CuriousErnestBro> my point is: trying to get rid of them with non-solutions isn't productive
[12:17:45] <piou> I agree that you don't neet JWT in your situation, said so from the beginning, but you shouldn't store the user's password either (and yes, I do mean on the client side)
[12:18:38] <CuriousErnestBro> why not? it's iOS, and if apple's sandboxing fails that's Stuff That Shouldn't Be My Problemâ„¢
[12:18:44] <piou> Passwords that are choosen by users can be reused and are rarely strong. Generating a good token, say 256 bits of cryptographic randomness, and storing that as an authentication token would be much better. That way you don't rely as much on the user having a strong password.
[12:19:11] <password> STRONG LIKE ME

[12:19:46] <piou> CuriousErnestBro: you need to store something client side anyway, store something that, if stolen, only implicates your platform
[12:20:21] <CuriousErnestBro> piou seems like you're trying to solve the user's problem of using "hunter2" as a password
[12:20:53] <CuriousErnestBro> the >if stolen thing isn't my problem, it's like assuming SSL is broken: above my pay grade
[12:21:23] <piou> You're focusing on the door saying that it's burglar proof while I'm telling you the house has lots of windows that are difficult to check
[12:22:19] <CuriousErnestBro> I'm saying it's not a house, it's a flat where everyone lives, and if they break in with me, they break in with a lot of apps, and it's not really my problem: it's the problem of the insurance company (apple) then
[12:22:22] <piou> A fundamental concept in security design is not to expect the best at any step but to consider the worst. Without delving into paranoÃ¯a there are many cases where that password can leak, be it through iOS issue, an issue on your server, an issue on TLS as you mentionned
[12:22:47] <piou> It's a question of respect of the user
[12:22:57] <CuriousErnestBro> respect?
[12:23:12] <password2> then you change it
[12:23:15] <CuriousErnestBro> I see where we "disagree"
[12:23:22] <password2> passwords leak everyday
[12:23:31] <password2> there no perfect solution
[12:23:39] <piou> CuriousErnestBro: Sure it doesn't bring you anything directly (unless you're in EU) but you do your part to ensure that even if you made a mistake in assessing the risk and the password does leak then it only implicates your app
[12:24:08] <CuriousErnestBro> piou I think security of iOS/TLS/etc. are filed under "reasonable assumptions I can make as a dev" 
[12:24:16] <piou> CuriousErnestBro: you're forgetting your own server
[12:24:34] <deniska> the server doesn't store passwords
[12:24:39] <piou> Security in depth is about not being arrogant by imagining that we've identified all risks even though we took time to try
[12:24:48] <piou> deniska: yes, but it receives them
[12:24:51] <CuriousErnestBro> I'm not, that's within my control, and should be secured to a reasonable extent 
[12:24:58] <deniska> piou: the server has to receive a password anyway
[12:24:59] <CuriousErnestBro> aka, not store plaintext passwords
[12:25:08] <deniska> piou: to, like, authenticate
[12:25:15] <piou> deniska: yes, but if that's a token then that password is only valid for the application, it cannot be reused
[12:25:32] <deniska> piou: the server has still to receive a password to give the token back
[12:25:47] <piou> deniska: only on the first connection remember
[12:25:55] <piou> he doesn't want the session to expire
[12:26:04] <piou> That significantly reduces the risk
[12:26:17] <piou> That's the whole point "Oh, something bad happened, the password leaks, let's make sure in that case it impacts as few things as possible"

[12:26:48] <deniska> and receive plenty of passwords
[12:27:12] <piou> deniska: hmm... depends on the specifics of the implementation
[12:27:18] <piou> but probably
[12:28:15] <piou> I just really don't like this attitude of "Hey, it's not really hard for me but I'm just going to expect the best", that has rarely lead to good things historically
[12:28:19] <deniska> CuriousErnestBro: FWIW you may also use http basic auth with a token provided by a server
[12:28:31] <deniska> "autogenerated application password" if you will
[12:29:05] <CuriousErnestBro> I'm not trying disrespect the security discipline, but trying to understand the rationale, last time I blindly followed this channel's advice I ended up re-implementing sessions 
[12:29:17] <deniska> but password still has to get out of the users device, you can't get around that
[12:29:36] <deniska> is there a benefit sending a password only once a year as opposed to once a request? Maybe? Dunno, not sure
[12:30:22] <CuriousErnestBro> piou to clarify, I'd like to know the "why" of doing stuff, and if the "why" is "TLS may be insecure" that's where I draw the line (the "reasonable assumption" thing). There's a limit to securing stuff, and for my purposes I've decided that's it

[12:31:43] <CuriousErnestBro> but that's shoving the problem to Gmail in the end

[13:16:18] <piou> CuriousErnestBro: read the thing. It's good, but it's not really fit for you I think. The basic protocol is... well it's exactly the protocole vdamewood mentionned earlier actually: the user keeps a private key, a challenge is sent by the server, the user signs the challenge, the server verifies the signature which authenticates the user. The good thing is taht apparently it can integrate with
[13:16:25] <piou> apple's touch id so the user doesn't have to see a private key (I'm not an iOS dev so I'm not clear on the specifics of that integration). The other bad part is that it doesn't solve your problem: this is an authentication protocol, but it's unreasonnable to do the entire protocol for each request. This implies that you need to keep the user logged in: back to managing a session. Good thing is

[13:25:47] <piou> CuriousErnestBro: my first sentiment for something like that would have been... No authentication, on first login the user generates a strong random number, sends it to the server in an initialization request over TLS and stores that number on the phone. The server accepts the request, create a server-side list for that number. Each request of the user is authenticated with that number which is
[13:25:53] <piou> sent in an authorization header. If the user wants to use the todo list on another device then a QR code is generated containing the secret number which can be scanned and integrated to the new phone. There are lots of issues with this, but that was my first sentiment upon reading "todo list". Main issues are that if you lose your phone without having shared the secret then you won't recover your
[13:25:59] <piou> todo list, you have to start a new one. Also there's no way to expire secrets in this scenario even though they're shared. But it also opens possibilities, such as a user posting the qr code somewhere for everyone to be able to view and modify the list (can be achieved in better ways of course, this is really crude as the user abandons his rights to the list completely). And it's simple enough
[13:26:05] <piou> that you can even have multiple lists per device, each with their own ID.

[14:14:43] <piou> alycidyne: I don't quite see where sandbox come into the mix though, or did you mean "languages based on a virtual machine"? Yet you talked of security...
[14:14:48] <mrig> Could POSIX have been better defined ?
[14:14:52] <GeDaMo> The most portable platform at the moment is the browser with Javascript :/
[14:15:01] <arahael> mrig: The specs could have been made available. ;)
[14:15:14] <mrig> Would that not greatly effect how languages interact with systems?
[14:15:35] <mrig> arahael: that would help I'm sure, surprised to hear that it was not.
[14:15:47] <deniska> GeDaMo: the most portable platform is DOS
[14:15:51] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: because, unlike Java which provides mostly the server-side, the web provides potentially both the client, network and server side :)
[14:16:03] <deniska> GeDaMo: it in the browser, and it works in many places a browser doesn't

[14:18:54] <piou> alycidyne: that's sounds like a huge confusion really, a virtual machine has by default nothing to do with a sandbox. Java does have a sandbox that can be configured and is integrated with the JVM. But that's more an exception than a rule. As for managers, I can't say, but java's security is about much more than being executed in a JVM. Automated memory management is a much bigger deal in my book.
[14:18:55] <arahael> deniska: No, it's still very much a microsoft thing.
[14:18:57] <mrig> How old is f# ?

[14:20:37] <arahael> Hmm, maybe.
[14:20:41] <Akronymus> f# is a mix of many languages.
[14:20:46] <alycidyne> piou: I was observing the confusion, not saying that it's true. Remember, managers (actually most software businesses) work by association. I know a virtual machine isn't theoretically linked to sandboxing, it's just particularly common to do sandboxing using VMs
[14:20:46] <arahael> I seem to gather that Ocaml doesn't have type classes, though./

[14:22:43] <alycidyne> piou: well I don't know the env in which you work, but in enterprise software understanding VM == sandboxing == portability
[14:22:51] <mrig> arahael: I think you could be right :)
[14:23:18] <arahael> alycidyne: That might depend on the enterprise and industry.
[14:23:42] <deniska> alycidyne: I don't think people nowadays pretend that VM automatically means sandboxing
[14:23:58] <deniska> alycidyne: or at least java demonstrated how that's not the case :)
[14:24:23] <piou> alycidyne: I get that it reflects your experience, but you can really tone that claim down, that doesn't seem to be the main association of idea anymore where I am (the sandboxing part at least)
[14:24:34] <deniska> and MS demonstrated how VM doesn't automatically means portability :P
[14:24:36] <mrig> stepping through parser code is really tedious, there has to be a better way of displaying this!
[14:24:55] <alycidyne> arahael: deniska: I would hope not, but most of my experiences have been of extreme despair at the capacity of people to separate concepts :-|

[14:53:28] <alycidyne> because linking consists of giving an address to external entities, and loading consists essentially of providing entities with an external value

[14:56:23] <alycidyne> So, most frameworks could be replaced with an extended linker and loader
[14:56:46] <GeDaMo> Maybe you could make use of the virtual memory system
[14:57:32] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: of course, this is more practical with single-level store, where every file becomes just a program segment directly manipulated by the linker

[16:46:29] <InPhase> pyzozord: Well that's unfortunate.  An exceptional event can happen to anyone once in a while.  But you want to watch out for a pattern in people.  A logical balance is to politely accept a one-time excuse from the interviewer and attempt to reschedule.  Then since you took the day off, you have a full day to spend looking for other positions to apply to, which can also make you feel better.  :)
[16:47:50] <pyzozord> He is from Mexico. I have worked with spanish cultures before, they seem to have much looser relationship with time than nordling cultures like Polish or Dutch.

[17:08:06] <alguien> smallvil_, i'm not familiar with the platform, but seeing as you first move the pointer and then that causes touch cancellation i would say yes. Are you not sure though that the events you get are "touch down", "move" (and then there's simply no "touch up"), rather than "touch", "move", "cancel touch"?

[17:19:05] <alguien> ajmea97, fun fact: C#'s Date is based on relative timestamps. Comparisons are made using these. This means that the a time of the local "kind" as they call it may differ from the same time converted to the UTC "kind"

[17:20:07] <gitesh> Hello programmers
[17:21:17] <alguien> so you should consider DateTimeOffset instead of DateTime. It's compatible; it's DateTime plus the Offset required for proper comparison

[19:05:38] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: that's parameteric polymorphism, the function or datatype (datatype in this example) is "parametric" over the type of the inputs, there's just 1 array implementation but it works with any type you give it

[20:09:34] <GeDaMo> Java probably has a Complex type
[20:09:53] <[itchyjunk]> But! i need to do things myself! lol

[20:53:23] <mrig> Is there any standard format for sending specifications into a lexical analyser? Perhaps used in syntax analysis in text editors?

[20:54:49] <mrig> I've no I idea, I'll take a look at those, thank you.
[20:55:12] <pyzozord> Language Server Provider, like pulse mentioned. New standard started by microsoft, by the way of typescript and vscode
[20:55:22] <mrig> Am thinking that a standard format would make the laborious part simple to import.
[20:55:45] <pyzozord> I'm not sure how widely adopted it is outside of vscode/typescript, but I think the intention there is to support any language

[20:56:42] <mrig> lex is an a parser generator right?
[20:56:52] *** Quits: xa0s (~xa0s@mab.sdf.org) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[20:57:02] <mrig> LSP a server, I was thinking of something a little lighter.
[20:57:26] <Inline> i think lex is the lexer
[20:57:34] <Inline> the parser generator is yacc or so
[20:57:51] <mrig> Oh right yes, lex being the same for all uses.
[20:58:03] <mrig> then you give your grammar to yacc, that sort of thing.
[20:58:28] <Inline> i thought that was more like, you specify your grammar in yacc
[20:58:42] <mrig> I was wondering how vim does its syntax highlighting, and imagine that it uses regexp.
[20:58:58] <Izem> yeah
[20:59:19] <Izem> emacs has lexers and parsers but I think it uses regex as well
[20:59:21] <mrig> Yes that is what I was thinking, that you give your grammar to yacc as a file of stream of char.
[20:59:28] <pyzozord> vim has syntax description language that is reminiscent of BNF
[20:59:37] <Izem> highlighting only requires a lexer
[20:59:45] <mrig> pyzozord: ah, that sounds more like what I was thinking of.
[20:59:58] <Izem> neovim has stuff?
[21:00:09] <karstensrage> [itchyjunk], mind a PM?
[21:00:20] <mrig> Highlighting would require contextual analysis if it is going to be any good though.
[21:00:26] <mrig> and top down too.
[21:00:50] <Izem> I guess it depends
[21:01:03] <Izem> a parser can give you proper information
[21:01:11] <mrig> Yes it would depend upon how much resources it all requires I suppose.
[21:01:16] <[itchyjunk]> not at all
[21:01:20] <pyzozord> vim's highlighting is service for the most part, but it can get confused sometimes and think half your screen is a string etc, or can drastically slow down entire vim on large files
[21:01:29] <pyzozord> *servicable
[21:02:02] <Izem> a lot of highlighting schemes don't make any sense, what informations is it supposed to tell you?
[21:02:26] <mrig> I am wondering how to specify my rules for formatting svg attributes is why I ask.
[21:02:34] <Izem> mrig: but yeah if it's syntax only then a lexer is fine
[21:02:49] <Inline> keywords of the language, special operators, operators, strings, comments.....
[21:03:03] <pyzozord> I've decided that my editor will have something like syntax highlighting but much more simple. It will not have any colors, only bolded font (so that it can potentially work on eink screens) and it will simply just highlight specific keywords
[21:03:16] <Inline> you might have a certain leeway in choosing colors for some or so
[21:03:24] <mrig> Well yes, how to 'load' a language specification into a program without having to hand build it each time, is the thought.
[21:03:38] <Izem> sounds like a parser then

[21:04:21] <mrig> I was wondering if there was any standard format for the data, such as something that could read the specifications grammatical rules if they were formatted specifically for it.
[21:04:48] <Izem> bnf or ebnf has an iso I think
[21:04:50] <Inline> EBNF
[21:04:52] <Izem> that's about it

[21:06:57] <mrig> Izem: the thought occurred as I have a lot of code to write to get the SVG standard into my languages types, which I am fine with doing. But if you were to code an editor, having some way of auto generating this sort of thing would be a real advantage.

[21:10:05] <bayaz> Title: Document Type Definition â€“ SVG 1.1 (Second Edition) 
[21:10:08] <mrig> GeDaMo: right yes there is, that in EBNF I think.
[21:10:51] <mrig> But the code is going into golang at the moment, I already have a bitvector set of all the types and how they can or can not be used together.
[21:11:22] <Izem> not sure what you are doing with the leaf data but that does not sound like lexing?
[21:11:26] <mrig> now just need to check the construction of each 'attribute' as the tokens come out of the lexer.
[21:11:48] <mrig> sure the xml parser only serves up strings which need to be lexed.

[23:32:44] <teut> The replacement policy is optimal. In other words, the cache is assumed to be given the entire sequence of memory accesses during algorithm execution. If it needs to evict a line at time t {\displaystyle t} t, it will look into its sequence of future requests and evict the line that is accessed furthest in the future. This can be emulated in
[23:32:44] <teut> practice with the Least Recently Used policy, which is shown to be within a small constant factor of the offline optimal replacement strategy[3]
