[01:01:33] <InPhase> Izem: For people who are careful with their passwords, and keep secure systems such that its unlikely for their passwords to be remotely compromised, it doesn't make too much sense.  But for people who live in the other state of being, where their passwords end up compromised by hackers running botnets, this provides a safeguard.  The botnets work at such a scale that this probably makes up the
[01:01:39] <InPhase> majority of compromises that the larger institutions have to deal with.
[01:02:30] <Izem> I see, I did not think of botnets
[01:02:53] <Izem> it's also a bit of a problem with vpns
[01:03:15] <Izem> and the fact that they are kinda telling you that you are easily identifiable :P
[01:03:20] <InPhase> Izem: I personally prefer when accounts let me disable all forms of 2 factor authentication.  I've been on the Internet for 27 years and never had a password of mine compromised.

[01:07:09] * Izem checks mdn
[01:07:20] <InPhase> Izem: Although if you don't trust your memory of your master password, you can write it down and hide it somewhere as a backup.

[04:53:04] <ross> hi all! apropos of nothing, I have a question about sql db design. part of my app involves the user creating Conditions, which are a series of condition terms, where an individual condition term is either a function or an operator. operators are things like AND, OR, NOT. I'm storing condition terms in their own table, and as a result, the parent 'conditions' table doesn't actually contain anything other than a primary key. is this a good practice?
[04:53:05] <ross> https://bpa.st/7EGA
[04:53:23] <arahael> guest4389: Consider you might have a subdirectory that actually places you in a parent directory, and as you keep recursing, you'll do that forever.

[04:56:14] <beaky> ross: yes having the 'keys' of the terms on a separate table from the terms themselves is more normalized
[04:57:50] <oldlaptop> ross: maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not sure having the separate conditions table accomplishes anything useful besides making it possible to represent an empty condition
[04:58:22] <ross> oldlaptop: a condition should be able to be empty, yes - but a condition can contain any number of terms and operators
[04:58:42] <ross> e.g. the condition `hasItem(pen) AND NOT hasItem(egg)` contains 4 terms
[04:58:56] <ross> 'any number' includes 0
[04:59:12] <ross> hence the 1-to-many relationship between conditions and condition terms
[04:59:17] <oldlaptop> the foreign key constraint from conditionTerms requires you to "create" the condition first, but if you don't need empty ones (or you find some excuse to not need empty ones) then you could simply say that a condition exists simply by having a conditionTerm with its ID
[04:59:46] <ross> I could, but I do need to be sure that an empty condition can exist - when the user creates a new condition, it will necessarily be empty
[05:00:48] <oldlaptop> is it necessary to create the condition, in this sense, at all if the user hasn't added any terms to it? (I suspect the answer is probably yes...)

[05:01:27] <arahael> ross: Is the user creating these tables dynamically, effectively? That's also "ok" in sqlite, but I'd probably suggest a more static design if you can fit it well.
[05:01:34] *** Joins: Twipply (~Twipply@user/twipply)
[05:01:39] <ross> possibly not? I think it's easier to guarantee that a row in the condition table exists even if the condition is empty rather than attempt to avoid hitting the database if the UI field is empty, perhaps at the cost of a little db space
[05:02:09] <ross> arahael: no, these tables are fixed - this is the (partial) schema for the save file for a dialogue tree editor
[05:02:21] <ross> they are creating rows dynamically :P
[05:02:43] <arahael> ross: Ah, good.  Also, regarding "hitting the database", I'd be a bit less concerned about that when it comes to sqlite.  sqlite is that awesome.
[05:03:02] <ross> oh agreed, I'm not worried about performance, just coding complexity lmao
[05:03:09] <oldlaptop> I agree this question is probably not of much practical interest, the conditions table is going to waste, what, eight octets per condition, with a minimum of (if this is sqlite) one page?
[05:03:10] <arahael> Cool. :)
[05:03:18] <ross> arahael: much easier to do things if you can guarantee that something exists, even if it's empty
[05:03:51] <ross> oldlaptop: perhaps it might be of concern if I am running this on a nokia brick
[05:04:03] <arahael> ross: Some database guys would probably find that problematic "your app's details are leaking into the database", but meh, I think that's perfectly valid when it comes to sqlite. It's an app-side database.
[05:04:34] <oldlaptop> the *real* low-hanging fruit for space-waste is the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY in conditionFunctions :P
[05:04:42] <ross> arahael: that's a good point. I have to admit I'm not well versed in good practices when it comes to 'proper' databases
[05:05:21] <oldlaptop> (even though it's sqlite you could make name the primary key in a WITHOUT ROWID database and save a whole eight octets per row)
[05:05:30] <ross> oldlaptop: it's referred to by the `conditionFunctionArgumentTypes` table, no?
[05:06:48] <oldlaptop> Sure, but that could refer to the name instead, in principle. Depending on how long names usually are, that probably cuts into the savings a fair bit
[05:07:53] <ross> oldlaptop: it could, but I don't like that - were I to update the name of a conditionFunction, I'd then have to iterate over the conditionFunctionArgumentTypes table and ensure that all those names are updated to. I chose to use a db in the first place to avoid having to do this

[05:14:40] <ross> this is my entire schema so far in all its unfinished glory https://bpa.st/IWJA
[05:15:08] <oldlaptop> going way back to your original question, you could do this with conditionTerms.operator, if you wanted!
[05:15:08] <oldlaptop> <arahael> ross: Ie, other tables can have a relation defined that they must map to an item in that table, such that there are a restricted set of options.
[05:15:14] <ross> (the 'conditionals' table at the bottom will be scrapped pending a re-think)
[05:15:49] <arahael> yeah, it ultimately depends on just how you need to specify and update that set of options.

[05:17:42] <ross> but I decided not to on the basis that if my user loads a corrupt schema, or a schema from a future version of the app, with an unknown operator, it would be better for the error message to contain "Unknown operator: XAND" or w/e rather than "Unknown operator" or worse "Unknown operator with ID 4"

[05:22:38] <oldlaptop> the search term would be "stored procedures"
[05:23:09] <arahael> oldlaptop: yeah, frankly i think sqlite should continue to avoid pl/sql.  people can always settle on whatever scripting language they like and register extensions.
[05:23:34] <oldlaptop> for most purposes, sqlite's support for application-defined functions does what you might want them for, and for some other purposes you could dump your code in the database and execute it yourself
[05:24:02] <arahael> arguably better, too, given the circumstances sqlite is used in.
[05:24:48] <ross> I suppose that could be useful in some cases - a db that stores procedures and not data is just another kind of data. can't think of any such cases off the top of my head thoug
[05:25:38] <ross> I guess you could use a static set of stored procedures to ensure that applications only interact with the db in a certain way, beyond what column constraints can guarantee?
[05:25:41] <oldlaptop> in a client/server database it can be very important to have code that executes on the server rather than the client
[05:25:59] <arahael> indeed, but sqlite is not a client/server database.
[05:26:02] <ross> ah! true - and you might not have enough need to implement a server-side implementation
[05:26:25] <oldlaptop> there is no such distinction for an embedded database like sqlite, though, so there's no reason (say) a new sql function can't just be application code
[05:27:12] <oldlaptop> the remaining irritation is that you can run into trouble if, say, you create a schema that uses some custom function or collation sequence, then try to open it with the sqlite3 command shell or something
[05:28:42] <arahael> i'm not sure i like the idea of having a data format being able to execute arbitruary code, though, so i prefer sqlite as it is.
[05:29:32] <arahael> eg, if i get a random sqlite file from someone and load it in sqlite3, i wouldnt want it to execute random stuff and install crap.

[09:11:35] <PlanckWalk> Even then you still wouldn't know for sure whether some weird behaviour of the compiler is expected behaviour according to the spec, or a compiler bug.
[09:12:07] <meleoron> PlanckWalk: with popular compilers, one can be reasonably sure that bugs won't be easy to find.
[09:12:15] <david_hilbert> Most of the documents you find online are the final drafts
[09:12:20] <PlanckWalk> It's probably safest to assume that 99% of all software written in these languages is full of bugs anyway, but at least it wouldbe nice to be able to *prove* it.
[09:12:27] <david_hilbert> Which may not be exactly identical to the finally published and paywalled document

[12:23:32] <W> teut, the child processes also runs the fork()
[12:24:21] <W> after the first fork, you have one new process, and one old, but both those two processes run the second fork

[12:27:44] <CoderGuy> so camelCase for languages that have camelCase as the convention for functions, and PascalCase for things like c#

[13:38:48] <immibis> man pertaining to human is indeed archaic

[13:47:54] <immibis> if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
[13:48:28] <immibis> why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men

[13:56:21] <arahael> pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.

[14:34:45] <arahael> pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
[14:35:29] <pyzozord> arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
[14:35:45] <GeDaMo> I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
[14:36:07] <vdamewood> I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp

[14:36:42] <mrig> you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
[14:37:03] <vdamewood> pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
[14:37:40] <arahael> pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.

[14:38:41] <arahael> Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
[14:38:51] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
[14:39:00] <vdamewood> Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
[14:39:43] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU

[14:40:10] <vdamewood> To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
[14:40:32] <arahael> pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
[14:40:41] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
[14:40:55] <vdamewood> arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?

[14:41:03] <pyzozord> arahael: nice thanks!
[14:41:04] <arahael> vdamewood: Probably.
[14:41:21] <GeDaMo> Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
[14:41:28] <arahael> pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
[14:41:39] <arahael> pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
[14:41:39] <pyzozord> arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
[14:41:51] <GeDaMo> We already have H265 and they're working on H266
[14:41:52] <vdamewood> It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
[14:42:15] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
[14:42:17] <arahael> vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(

[14:44:44] <vdamewood> pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
[14:45:39] <vdamewood> Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
[14:45:53] <pyzozord> hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry

[14:50:09] <arahael> vdamewood: They moved here, too.
[14:50:31] <arahael> vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.

[14:51:02] <immibis> i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.

[18:53:55] <pyzozord> I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
[18:53:59] <mrig> pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
[18:55:08] <mrig> it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
[18:56:18] <pyzozord> yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything

[18:59:09] <pyzozord> well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of

[23:42:54] <novns> statistics never lies
[23:43:24] <pyzozord> my solution idea was: treat entire input array as one big number in binary, reversed. Create a prefix sum for each bit position with info what is the decimal value at that point. Then use 2sum algorithm (two pointers moving from edges to the center) to find the cut off points where values for each subarray is equal
[23:43:32] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:44:07] <pyzozord> so [1,1,0] I treat as 011, so 3, the prefix would be [1,3,3]
[23:45:06] <brickfat> it would nice to be 1 kilobytes operating systems
[23:45:21] <beaky> yes i think it is big endian

[23:48:28] <pyzozord> oh wait, no, it actually does!
