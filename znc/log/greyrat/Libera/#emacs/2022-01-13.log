[00:02:46] <Catie> I'd _love_ to use IRC, but I can't imagine anyone I work with being okay with just text
[00:02:49] <grym> it is so, so much faster
[00:02:50] <Common-Lisp> my company switched from IRC to Google Chat and it's really been a disaster 
[00:03:02] <xaltsc> bpalmer: So, it's a bad idea to have a configuration file named org.el ?
[00:03:11] <Bayes> interesting, Matrix is gaining popularity but I've never used it myself so I have no sense how nice it is
[00:03:29] <Catie> I just tried it out yesterday I think, it reminds me a lot of Discord
[00:03:35] <Common-Lisp> Matrix is like a tractor trailer at this point. very useful, but not very fast. 
[00:03:38] <Bayes> is that ... good? XD
[00:03:53] <Common-Lisp> It's way better now than it was 2 to 4 years ago, but it still has a looooong way to go.
[00:04:01] <bpalmer> xaltsc: not necessarily, but it does mean you might need to be careful.
[00:04:14] <Bayes> https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/element oh it DOES look like discord
[00:04:18] <xaltsc> bpalmer: thanks :)
[00:04:29] <Catie> It's shiny and has that sort of polished-web-app feel, you know? But here's the thing. It's not Discord. So if I want to use a god damn terminal application I won't get my account terminated. Plus I could self-host
[00:04:30] <Common-Lisp> element is heavily inspired by discord, yes.
[00:04:35] <Common-Lisp> many clients are less discord inspired.
[00:04:43] <Common-Lisp> for example, Nheko is trying to be a very close Telegram clone.
[00:05:01] <bpalmer> (dolist (f (directory-files "~/.emacs.d/conf" t "\\.el\\'")) (load f)) <-- load up all the files in that conf directory, in string-lessp sorted order
[00:05:03] <Catie> The shiny-web-app-ness is what would get the untechnical people on board, I think
[00:05:18] <Common-Lisp> the matrix self-hosting story right now is also not very good
[00:05:18] *** cacheyou- is now known as cacheyourdreams
[00:05:31] <Catie> It's not?
[00:05:38] <Common-Lisp> I have a matrix server and it can't even join most matrix.org rooms that have >1000 users in them 
[00:05:47] <bpalmer> xaltsc: that way you don't need to mess with load path, you don't need to do anything, just name your files 'A-org.el', 'B-cmode.el', 'C-java.el' or whatever.
[00:06:08] <Common-Lisp> once dendrite-polylith is actually usable it'll be great and amazing, but I hear there's only 1 dev working on it full time, and there's no ETA 
[00:06:11] <Catie> Oh, I'd try not to federate. I was thinking for internal use, just a daemon running on the local server
[00:06:23] <xaltsc> bpalmer: Just one last thing, I can't find out what require does when the feature/filename points to a dir
[00:06:29] <Common-Lisp> you might have a better time locally
[00:06:37] <xaltsc> bpalmer: Yeah, I'm prepending them with conf-*
[00:06:39] <Common-Lisp> the problem is matrix's server software is very, very, very resource-intensive
[00:06:58] <Catie> Common-Lisp: Ah, that could very well be an issue
[00:07:14] <bpalmer> xaltsc: the point of the A , B, C etc was s oyou control the order that they're loaded in.
[00:07:27] <mdk> I can relate, I'm self hosting my matrix server, and I have hard time joining some rooms :(
[00:07:28] <Bayes> so wait matrix has bridges, so they're not for a "chat service" but for one client that rules them all?
[00:08:02] <bpalmer> xaltsc: yes, you'd have to experiment, but I think it would just interpret it as a subdirectory in part
[00:08:10] <Common-Lisp> Bayes: I don't understand your question 
[00:08:37] <Bayes> I thought matrix was a protocol, but it seems to be a client that can connect to several networks?
[00:08:55] <Bayes> so you use matrix and can talk to people via slack, irc, etc all in one?
[00:09:03] <Common-Lisp> Bayes: matrix is a protocol. Many people have written matrix clients that also connect to other services. 
[00:09:05] <grym> there are bridges
[00:09:10] <Common-Lisp> that isn't built into the protocol, that's just people writing clients.

[03:26:23] <wasamasa> debatable
[03:26:27] <sonny> lol
[03:26:43] <wasamasa> it turns out that using GNU make was the least icky option
[03:27:07] <technomancy> yeah IMO gnu make is pretty decent on its own.
[03:27:15] <wasamasa> the newest development is that they've switched to a declarative format for libraries, which makes use of a make-like helper program
[03:27:19] <wasamasa> `chicken-do`
[03:27:22] <technomancy> as long as you can avoid autotools and stuff
[03:27:39] <technomancy> I recently found out that autotools is the primary system for guile O_O

[04:16:09] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: I think what edgar-rft 's suggestion is tied to is: are you unhappy that when you hit return on a line, the next line is immediately indented at all; or are you concerned with which column it indents to?
[04:17:31] <Unicorn_Princess> Catie, just plain text in this case. for example say I want to write a list starting with: "organizationally these items are:". and then i hit enter and tab, and it'll indent me all the way to the end of 'organizationally'
[04:18:03] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: in your buffer, what is the value of major-mode ? (C-h v major-mode RET ) 
[04:18:13] <Unicorn_Princess> bpalmer, with which column. currently in plain text mode, it doesn't automatically indent on enter. it might be nice, but, one thing at a time
[04:18:21] <Catie> That's more or less the behvior I get in Fundamental Mode, though it indents me to the start of "these" rather than the end of "organizationally"

[04:35:17] <Unicorn_Princess> oh i do have one more question, given i'll be messing with spacemac's config stuff: this readme here: https://github.com/pmarinov/clean-aindent-mode
[04:35:51] <Unicorn_Princess> the instructions to activate say to (set 'clean-aindent-is-simple-indent t)
[04:36:19] <Unicorn_Princess> but if installed via melpa, it says to (setq clean-aindent-is-simple-indent t)
[04:37:05] <Unicorn_Princess> now i'm clueless when it comes to elisp, but why does one have "set '", and the other just "setq"? if i understand correctly, the ' is simply part of the variable name?
[04:37:53] <Catie> (set 'symbol) and (setq symbol) should be equivalent. set isn't used as often anymore though, because setq is more convenient
[04:38:33] <Catie> "more convenient" it's the same number of keypresses. setq is more ubiquitous, for some reason that may or may not have to do with convenience

[05:55:23] <twb> Is apply-partially a haskell function, or an elisp function?
[05:55:28] <ornx> how do i get emacs to run as a native wayland client
[05:55:33] <acdw> elisp!
[05:55:42] <acdw> that works like haskell, sorry
[05:55:45] <twb> OK that makes more sense
[05:55:51] <twb> acdw: in scheme this is called a "cut"
[05:55:56] <ornx> ive got emacs gcc version which i think uses pure gtk, and ive set GDK_BACKEND=wayland, but when i unset $DISPLAY it doesnt work..

[17:37:09] <ecraven> so, one follow-up question, is there a way to get a weekly or monthly summary, showing *daily* times and the total? clockreport-mode in the agenda doesn't show per-day values
[17:37:40] *** Quits: sad (~sad@109.252.14.3) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:38:16] <tyson2> I haven't done this, but according to the manual you can set a :block value which indicates the time range to consider
[17:38:34] *** Joins: _sad (~sad@109-252-14-3.nat.spd-mgts.ru)
[17:39:05] <tyson2> also, I think that if you have a week view in the agenda, the clock table will adjust automatically
[17:39:33] <tyson2> but I don't know if it will show a breakdown by day
[17:40:08] <tyson2> probably on worg you could find some more info, likely also on stackoverflow
[17:41:32] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@154.6.152.74)
[17:42:14] <tyson2> it looks like you can set a :step value to day, which will split the table into daily chunks

[19:05:15] <acdw> blaub: I honestly don't even remember what i use .. i think the default, maybe bluebird
[19:05:40] <johnjaye> i'm big on repeatability. i always want to know how to config my setup from scratch on any machine i'm on
[19:05:47] <johnjaye> so i would be horrified not remembering my setup
[19:06:36] <grym> hmm, i thought a point of repeatability was that you never _have_ to remember
[19:07:00] <johnjaye> well yeah as much as possible i like it to be automated in a script or something
[19:07:17] <johnjaye> but some things like e.g. in mac changing the terminal to recognize Meta y ou can only do manually
[19:07:35] <acdw> johnjaye: yes
[19:07:41] <acdw> oh shit, i mean for emacs
[19:07:43] <acdw> lmao
[19:08:01] <johnjaye> i don't even know how repeatable my emacs setup is
[19:08:21] <johnjaye> it's something like install my minimal init.el. then run package-install <any packages i need>. then hope they got dumped into custom.el which i load automatically
[19:09:13] <acdw> my emacs setup is quite repeatable afaik, that's what i care about
[19:09:16] <johnjaye> doom is somewhat rigid about it. everytime you install doom it downloads a hundred packages from a list and compiles them iirc
[19:09:25] <acdw> why i don't use dum
[19:09:27] <acdw> doom*
[19:09:59] <johnjaye> i guess i should have some packages like avy or ivy download automatically
[19:10:16] <davemq> johnjaye: well, not quite. You can use "doom sync -u" which says update packages. Without the "-u" it only installs what it needs to satisfy anything new in your init.el and package.el (IIRC)
[19:10:38] <johnjaye> i'm talking when you install doom on a new machine
[19:10:48] <johnjaye> the installer script downloads a bunch of packages from melpa
[19:11:43] <davemq> johnjaye: Right. But you can also trigger downloading MORE packages with "doom sync -u".
[19:11:45] *** Joins: AndrewYu (andrew@user/andrewyu)
[19:12:03] <johnjaye> right. but that's only if you manually change something right

[19:12:16] <davemq> yep
[19:12:18] <bremner> I tried doom, but I just don't love first-person-shooters.
[19:12:32] <davemq> bremner: wrong doom :)
[19:12:32] <johnjaye> doom should have a terminal only version right
[19:12:40] <johnjaye>  you'd think it wouldn't be *that* hard
[19:12:52] <acdw> bremner: lmao
[19:13:02] <johnjaye> i played a youtube video in the terminal and i could make out some text with slightly smaller font size
[19:13:19] * davemq 's mind boggles
[19:13:46] <johnjaye> luckily bsd gives you a *very* small terminal font size. i have to change it to actually read it

[20:10:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The static site generator?
[20:10:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's unsurprising. No server-side or client-side processing will usually be faster.
[20:10:56] <tyson2> yes.  Netlify hosts hugo sites, and add a kind of cms lite to it
[20:11:14] <rpav> Aurora_v_kosmose: it's not faster actually
[20:11:18] <tyson2> the idea is that they will be faster than cms's like wordpress etc.
[20:11:44] <qsx> i’m a bit confused by cc-mode style configuration
[20:11:50] <rpav> Aurora_v_kosmose: consider the above blog example .. serving _even less_ and the client not dumping its state and rendering even less is faster
[20:12:43] <rpav> it's possible someone has a "static site generator" that _looks_ like a static site to the user but essentially does this, but it's not clear with hugo specifically at a glance .. maybe reading further in clarifies that it does that
[20:12:55] <qsx> i want the contents of a c++ namespace indented the same level as the namespace itself, i.e. `namespace foo {\nclass bar {\n  typ member;`
[20:12:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> SPAs are abominations, but yes they wouldn't be any faster if your'e just hosting that.

[20:40:30] <tyson2> Clog does use js, but as a typical developer you normally wouldn't need to descend to that level
[20:41:22] <tyson2> Aurora_v_kosmose: yes, but it seems like it might be less ambitious than electron
[20:41:45] *** Joins: PacMiam (~PacMiam@user/pacmiam)
[20:41:59] <tyson2> Electron seems like it wants to recreate the Win32 api in the browser
[20:42:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> huh
[20:42:47] <tyson2> anyway, hope to try out clog pretty soon, need to get up to speed with SBCL first
[20:42:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I haven't really used Electron so far, so it's mostly the bundles-with-browser that reminded me of it.

CLOG uses websockets for communications and the browser to render a GUI that maintains an active soft realtime connection. For most CLOG applications all programming logic, events and decisions are done on the server which can be local, or remote over the web.

[22:28:36] <bpalmer> otherwise, write a function that examines the contents of a file to see if it looks more prologish or more perlish and then calls the right mode, and associate pl files with that
[22:28:54] <eof> bpalmer: that was honestly my best thought as to the solution, heuristics
[22:28:59] <bpalmer> something like (save-excursion (if (re-search-forward ":-" nil t) (prolog-mode) (perl-mode)))
[22:30:08] *** Joins: mfisher (mfisher@shell.themfishers.com)
[22:30:54] <bpalmer> you could also play around with eval: directory-local variables that add stuff to auto-mode-alist , or have your function check a variable that can be nil("unset")/perl/prolog   , which you set in a directory local variable , before falling back to heuristics.
[22:31:08] <bpalmer> I *believe* directory local variables will be present before the mode function is called.
