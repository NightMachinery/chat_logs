[00:24:08] <GuiToris> hmm, something is crazy indeed. I found a map on the bottom of the page that does use 'Michigander'

[00:25:35] <tinwhiskers> being called "Mich" isn't a name people give themselves. It likely comes as a nickname from when they were out of town (like at college). Similarly, I had a mate called Tas, but people from Tasmania don't give themselves that name.

[00:57:58] <StayHungry> GuiToris: in the spirit of Ambrose Bierce's dictionary, it is highly likely you spoke with a man from Michigan who heard enough news about transgender people and decided to joke by writing a portmanteau Michigender (like podcast = ipod + broadcast). For example, the capital of Russia is sometimes called Moskvabad, referring to the cities of Central Asia such as Ashkhabad, from where migrant workers come en masse for seasonal jobs.
[01:00:38] <GuiToris> I didn't ask it because I'm paranoid. You just can't believe how many transgender/gay people have found me in the last two years. I feel like I know them all
[01:01:28] <GuiToris> and some of them didn't even look transgender!

[01:36:59] <Looney> Hi. One of the first rules I learned about English, was that you can't put an adverb between a verb and its object, because it sounds bad
[01:37:33] <StayHungry> GuiToris: As a fan of black-and-white American movies, I remember this scene in a World War II musical designed to 'boost' the Navy   https://imgchest.com/p/9p4nezm54nq
[01:37:52] <Looney> and indeed, it does sound bad. I hate grammar "rules" because they usually end up being misleading, but that "rule" seemed to make sense
[01:38:23] <Looney> but now I just saw the following sentence in a book, and to me it sounds pretty bad
[01:39:14] <Looney> "[ the pandemic ] it is likely to accelerate many of the changes that were already taking place before it erupted, which will in turn set in motion other changes"
[01:39:42] <Looney> that "set in motion other changes", shouldn't it be "set other changes in motion"?
[01:40:43] <GuiToris> StayHungry, they do look pretty, but not pretty enough to join the navy
[01:44:02] <GuiToris> I can't really enjoy black-n-white movies, I'm stuck in the 80's where color TVs were already invented
[01:44:53] <GuiToris> Even Tron (the original) was really-really hard to watch!
[01:46:30] <GuiToris> in contrast, I've seen the new one multiple times
[01:48:06] <bin> Looney: I agree with you
[01:48:12] <bin> "set in motion other changes" sounds horrible
[01:50:03] <StayHungry> GuiToris: not so long ago in Russia they made a music commercial for a game with a naval theme, where a young sailor, scrubbing the deck and dreaming of a girl ashore, suddenly finds himself on board full of women :) the piquancy is added by the fact that the authors have tried to recreate the American pin-up aesthetic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcjDzi3ghtM
[01:50:10] <Looney> bin, and note (I forgot to add it) that at the end there's a period: "set in motion other changes. (period)"

[01:50:33] <bin> that's awful

[12:04:26] <tokam> Also I have some chilli chocolate for you. A friend told me that mexican girls like it, but I am sure you won't get sweeter and hotter from it because you are already the best. Hahaha.

[12:30:33] <tokam> the thing is, I want to flirt but I do not want to flirt .. 
[12:30:42] <tokam> because she has a boyfriend now .... 
[12:31:29] <tokam> It's not the right timing to get flirty and warm in my letter

[12:32:40] <tokam> don't get your question
[12:32:54] <tokam> ok I will rethink my words and writing ... 
[12:33:03] <tokam> but for an application letter the grammar needs to be right ... 
[12:33:10] <tokam> what do you think about the grammar?
[12:33:43] <iridium__> tokam: what's her major?
[12:34:05] <tokam> business (and investment banking)
[12:34:27] <tokam> major subject?
[12:35:02] <tokam> hope you dont know her
[12:35:24] <iridium__> tokam: if you want to fornicate with her, you're gonna have to be much more forthcoming than that, friend.
[12:36:00] <tokam> I can do it later
[12:36:39] <tokam> If I do it, I will probably marry her. But before that I just stay a bit in the friendzone.

[16:16:35] <LimeOn> tokam: i think that "el semáforo es verde" should be " El semáforo está en verde"

[16:17:32] <tinsoldier> semaphore — Noun: 1. Any equipment used for visual signalling by means of flags, lights, or mechanically moving arms, which are used to represent letters of the alphabet, or words., 2. (figuratively) A visual system for transmitting information using the above equipment; especially, by means of two flags held one in each hand, using an alphabetic <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/semaphore>...
[16:17:55] <tokam> Hm LimeOn you seem to be right
[16:17:58] <tokam> my version is wrong?
[16:18:16] <LimeOn> el semaforo es verde means= the semaphore is green
[16:18:26] <StayHungry> tokam: don't go out of your way to impress someone with your language skills in a greeting telegram. a little sloppiness in the subtle nuances of grammatical forms reflects the real picture inherent in non-native speakers. the main thing is that the lines are loaded with benevolent thoughts about the addressee.
[16:19:19] <tokam> LimeOn: so I wrote, that the object is green and not the light?
[16:19:33] <LimeOn> tokam: yes, you wrote that
[16:19:43] <LimeOn> but it is little improtant i think
[16:20:26] <iridium__> tokam: here comes the truth. if i were that girl, i would think you're stalking me and would put that postcard in the dustbin along with the thought of me being together with you anytime soon.
[16:20:36] <iridium__> tokam: it sucks, frankly.
[16:21:00] <StayHungry> iridium__: which is why I offered him a less cheesy option, https://bpa.st/6V4A
[16:22:00] <iridium__> StayHungry: much better. i'd lose the book recommendation and send her my undying love instead.
[16:22:07] <StayHungry> :D

[16:25:24] <iridium__> tokam: no, you may not.
[16:25:32] <tokam> So tell me
[16:25:40] <tokam> I already asked
[16:27:13] <iridium__> tokam: you asked if you can ask about my age. different thing.
[16:27:29] <iridium__> tokam: you asked for permission, not age. permission denied.

[16:37:08] <tokam> I am not rich now 
[16:37:12] <tokam> but I will be in 1-2 years
[16:37:13] <iridium__> tokam: startup?
[16:37:20] <iridium__> tokam: e-commerce, AI?
[16:37:23] <tokam> my plan was to delay her a bit ... 
[16:37:29] <tokam> and see what's up in 1-2 years
[16:37:44] <iridium__> tokam: she's not a task you can delay. find some other woman your age.
[16:37:48] <tokam> I changed my card a bit 
[16:37:52] <tokam> I think it's okay 
[16:38:01] <tokam> because before she met this dude she wrote me that she missed me 
[16:38:02] <iridium__> tokam: she's gone.
[16:38:12] <iridium__> tokam: now she doesn't.
[16:38:21] <tokam> I wrote her once that I will hug her when we meet and she "only hug [tears smily]" ... 
[16:38:32] <tokam> yea now she maybe does not 
[16:38:35] <iridium__> tokam: you missed the train a long time ago, dude. for all you know he could be drugging her with pheromones.
[16:38:39] <tokam> So I wanted to send my card a bit more conservative 
[16:38:57] <tokam> rather defensive than aggressive 
[16:39:00] <tokam> being fine i the friendzone
[16:39:08] <tokam> I want to have fun here and get rich

[16:39:17] <tokam> if she is gone, she is gone 
[16:39:29] <tokam> if the world looks different in 1-2 years maybe we marry, nobody knows 
[16:39:31] <iridium__> tokam: find some divorcee who's willing to work on your startup.
[16:39:52] <tokam> iridium__: I do not agree with the deadzoned 
[16:40:12] <iridium__> tokam: and try to woo her. maybe she'll be enamoured with your excellent Harvard education.
[16:40:26] <tokam> my original plan was take some time ... be in the friendzone ... meet her as a friend .. make up my mind what I want .. .and than decide if I want to stay a friend or not and if not, than I go all in 
[16:40:29] <iridium__> tokam: you're dead in the water.
[16:40:46] <tokam> you are very arrogant 
[16:40:54] <tokam> I do not like my card so much .... 
[16:40:58] <iridium__> tokam: the only way you can woo her now is if she's a total gold-digger and you have a lot of gold.

[16:41:06] <tokam> but I think she will be charmed anyways 
[16:41:15] <tokam> but I expect now rather a negative effect 
[16:41:26] <tokam> I mean I would like her as a friend too 
[16:41:29] <iridium__> tokam: she'll be more than charmed. she'll be disgusted.
[16:41:33] <tokam> and I want to keep that connection 
[16:41:58] <tokam> you are a very negative person.
[16:41:58] <iridium__> tokam: there ain't no connection. 
[16:42:03] <iridium__> tokam: i'm sane.

[22:13:02] <GuiToris> if you saw the page, you might say something different
[22:13:37] <GuiToris> what is she saying here? https://www.ldoceonline.com/media/english/ameProns/ld5_000.mp3
[22:13:41] <GuiToris> what do you hear?
[22:14:18] <bin> uhh
[22:14:23] <pussipupu> treble zero
[22:14:27] <bin> I don't have enough context
[22:14:33] <bin> I hear struggle
[22:14:37] <GuiToris> bin, I can provide you one
[22:14:43] <pussipupu> though it sounds a bit like "trouble" with that accent
[22:15:07] <GuiToris> bin 'the telephone number you use in Australia to call the police, the FIRE SERVICE, or an AMBULANCE when there is an emergency'
[22:15:08] <LjL> i can't tell (but i don't count)
[22:15:16] <LjL> oh, triple?
[22:15:19] <bin> I hear "Struggle Zera" but Zera isnt a word
[22:15:33] <Baguette> Treble Zero
[22:15:35] <GuiToris> I hear what pussipupu also hear
[22:15:39] <LjL> i hear zero but i definitely was hearing a b over a p
[22:15:46] <bin> Oh wait this is an Australian accent?
[22:15:49] <GuiToris> no
[22:15:54] <LjL> well it's gonna be triple, given the context
[22:15:57] <blkshp> [19:43:41] <GuiToris> what do you hear?
[22:15:57] <GuiToris> bin, this is an american voice

[22:16:02] <blkshp> Nothing but the rain. Grab your gun and bring the cat in.
[22:16:03] <Baguette> I hear "Treble Zero"
[22:16:04] <bin> well Zera isn't a word
[22:16:19] <GuiToris> the british pronunciation is much clearer
[22:16:19] <bin> And Zero isn't pronounced Zera in any AmE dialect I've heard
[22:16:21] <bin> soo
[22:16:22] <placeb0> cats and rain
[22:16:31] <placeb0> I only have the cats 
[22:16:32] <pussipupu> Sounds like an American accent to me
[22:16:33] <bin> idk maybe it got cut off badly
[22:16:47] <GuiToris> so I thought you would call the three numbers 'trouble zero' but I just can't hear it 'triple'
[22:16:53] <blkshp> Zeroh
[22:16:55] <GuiToris> and again, this is from a dictionary
[22:17:13] <bin> I'm an American, and this does not sound like an American accent saying anything coherent
[22:17:17] <pussipupu> I don't know how you're hearing "zera"
[22:17:17] <Baguette> Treble is another way to say triple
[22:17:20] <blkshp> That, im pretty sure is just a zero in a North American accent
[22:17:23] <huf> treble can mean triple
[22:17:24] <huf> sometimes
[22:17:27] <GuiToris> the british one: https://www.ldoceonline.com/media/english/breProns/ld5_000.mp3
[22:17:34] <blkshp> Oh, bi's the expert
[22:17:36] <blkshp> bin*
[22:17:44] <Baguette> Treble Zero
[22:17:48] <LjL> well wiktionary says triple can only be /ˈtɹɪpəl/ and not /ˈtɹaɪpəl/, however if the context is "the telephone number you use in Australia to call the police, the FIRE SERVICE, or an AMBULANCE when there is an emergency", it cannot be anything other than 000
[22:17:49] <bin> Zero is not pronounced like that in any accent I've heard
[22:17:49] <GuiToris> trouble zero would make sense here I guess
[22:18:05] <LjL> bin, i don't hear zera, i hera zero, fwiw
[22:18:07] <blkshp> 90210
[22:18:11] <bin> LjL: i hear zera
[22:18:14] <bin> in the first one
[22:18:15] <Baguette> The accent is basic high school girl who goes to the mall too mch
[22:18:16] <blkshp> I'm with LjL
[22:18:24] <Baguette> xD
[22:18:28] <blkshp> Though don't tell them it would ruin both our images.
[22:18:32] <bin> lolol
[22:18:43] <bin> I mean I have my ear to the speaker and it sounds like she's saying Zera
[22:19:12] <blkshp> Need a new speaker ;)
[22:19:18] <bin> i tried on others as well
[22:19:19] <LjL> bin, "ah" is a single vowel, she's saying a glide of some kind (it's more open than the "oh" in the british sample, but still a glide)
[22:19:20] <bin> same thing
[22:19:28] <blkshp> zehrow.
[22:19:37] <StayHungry> :D
[22:19:46] <GuiToris> I can show you the site now; https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/000 though the audio will stay the same
[22:20:02] <GuiToris> but you couldn't make me hear 'triple'
[22:20:19] <LjL> "zero" is actually a no brainer for me in that sample... although, like, i knew the answer in advance so it doesn't really count. but i'd *never* have guessed "triple" without the context
[22:20:21] <GuiToris> I checked the pronunciation of 'triple', but it doesn't sound like 'trouble' there
[22:20:47] <blkshp> treble
[22:20:51] <mdogg> The girl who is pronouncing "triple" is saying "trouble".  She must be an idiot.
[22:20:52] <Baguette> It sounds like Treble, but then again, I am a geek so
[22:21:04] <GuiToris> it feels better that nobody guessed it right
[22:21:11] <LjL> :)
[22:21:19] <blkshp> You didn't ask me
[22:21:33] <blkshp> or i was too late. Treble Zero 100%, how can anyone hear anything else lol
[22:21:36] <GuiToris> I think bin is hearing 'zera' because she might use small laptop speakers
[22:21:41] <bin> it still sounds like zera, also I don't know a single person who would say "treble" instead of "triple"
[22:21:42] <mdogg> It is treble.  
[22:21:53] <bin> so i'm calling horsefeathers on the whole thing
[22:21:55] <blkshp> We say treble all the time
[22:21:59] <blkshp> 999 = treble 9
[22:22:00] <bin> i mean in the US
[22:22:05] <blkshp> oh.
[22:22:05] <GuiToris> it happened me too when I listened to my recordings on a small speaker
[22:22:19] <mdogg> She has no business being an example for pronunciation.  
[22:22:22] <blkshp> Well no, is treble even a word there!? other than the musical usage?
[22:22:29] <LjL> so uh it's an american pronunciation of something that a brit transcribed wrong?
[22:22:51] <blkshp> I concur
[22:22:53] <Baguette> Yes, Treble in some cases means triple
[22:22:54] <bin> i just put it onto my stereo
[22:22:57] <blkshp> But you're still a shit. xD
[22:22:59] <GuiToris> treble zero doesn't carry much meaning
[22:23:07] <blkshp> Does to me
[22:23:08] <huf> oh just say "triple oh"
[22:23:12] <el> pronunciations aren't a reflection of intelligence
[22:23:13] <blkshp> But then we're great.
[22:23:17] <blkshp> lol
[22:23:20] <bin> I hear zero more now, but like in a valley girl accent or something
[22:23:30] <blkshp> Valley, yes
[22:23:34] <mdogg> She does sound like a valley girl.
[22:23:37] <blkshp> That's what i was thinking of when i couldn't think
[22:23:39] <bin> which is kind of like a caricature
[22:23:47] <blkshp> LEgally Blonde
[22:23:59] <GuiToris> valley girls are attractive, aren't they?
[22:23:59] <mdogg> yeah.
[22:24:00] <bin> so I almost wonder if this is actually an American or if it's someone doing what they think is an American impression
[22:24:03] <blkshp> Dayumn is the next word!
[22:24:20] <blkshp> It's what i'd do xD
[22:24:24] <LjL> uhm https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/treble does have "3. (rare) Threefold, triple." and i didn't know that
[22:24:47] <mdogg> GuiToris: As a stereotype, I would say they are generally attractive and dim witted.  
[22:25:00] <GuiToris> bin, I doubt if a fancy dictionary hires non native speakers to pretend they are
[22:25:21] <GuiToris> mdogg, good combination
[22:25:32] <mdogg> heh, not really.
[22:25:50] <bin> GuiToris: it wouldn't surprise me
[22:25:57] <LjL> only in english anyway can you have a discussion like this, with this amount of confusion even among native speakers, over the pronunciation of something like "000"
[22:25:59] <bin> we literally do not say "treble zero" here. That is not a thing we say
[22:26:16] <huf> yeah cos you say nine one one
[22:26:18] <mdogg> Nor do we here.
[22:26:23] <GuiToris> I'll try to find another sample from her
[22:26:43] <bin> huf: there are plenty of times we say triple zero
[22:26:57] <mdogg> That's why I think we should put that valley girl out of our minds.  She is obviously confused.
[22:28:56] <bin> you know i'm recording myself saying "zero
[22:28:58] <bin> "
[22:29:02] <bin> and it does actually kind of sound like "zera"

[22:29:26] <mdogg> lol "thrice" 
[22:29:33] <GuiToris> bin, try saying 'triple' it may sound 'trouble/treble' too

[22:44:07] <blkshp> I wonder if there is a hieratic version of Windows
[22:44:24] <GuiToris> !d hieratic
[22:44:28] <tinsoldier> hieratic — Noun: 1. (historical) A writing system used in pharaonic Egypt that was developed alongside the hieroglyphic system, primarily written in ink with a reed brush on papyrus, allowing scribes to write quickly without resorting to the time consuming hieroglyphs., — Adjective: 1. Of or pertaining to priests, especially pharaonic priests of A <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hieratic>...
[22:44:42] <huf> is that how pharaoh reads his mail then?
[22:44:45] <huf> "let my people go"

[22:51:12] <mdogg> It's a dictionary and thesaurus.  Nothing more.
[22:51:14] <huf> you should move on to real dictionaries though
[22:51:21] <huf> stop aggerating on this learner nonsense
[22:51:24] <Baguette> They would never win because these are Cryllic Letters
[22:51:36] <huf> you're more than good enough to read real texts now
[22:51:49] <GuiToris> huf, there are language learners, native speakers and blkshp
[22:51:54] <huf> eh
[22:52:06] <mdogg> But it is my very favorite dictionary and thesaurus.  And I have examined many others.   
[22:52:12] <Baguette> And what about the word ñ? Technically, it is not the same letter as N, and so most people would lose as well?
[22:52:17] *** bin is now known as bintober
[22:52:21] <Baguette> like Piñata
[22:52:42] <mdogg> That's a Spanish word and a Spanish letter.
[22:52:48] <huf> Baguette: I think this is why the game has rules
[22:52:55] <GuiToris> !trans es en piñata

[22:53:37] <mdogg> We don't have an English word for piñata.  We just say piñata in America.

[22:55:18] <huf> that's so there's at least one linguistic map of europe where hungary isnt the weird one

[22:56:16] <MetaNova> but everyone since then has known that it's whatever you agree on as the group
[22:56:32] <placeb0> pine is a type of tree so I guess someone thought a pineapple looks like an apple with a tree on top?
[22:56:33] <mdogg> Je suis un ananas.  
[22:56:41] <MetaNova> that includes language/dictionary/slang/number of limbs/if vowels are excluded/whatever
[22:56:42] <huf> it looks like a pinecone
[22:56:42] <huf> a bit
[22:56:49] <huf> but it's an apple because you eat it
[22:56:51] <huf> duh
[22:57:11] <blkshp> mmm beer
[22:57:14] <MetaNova> why are crabapples not shaped like crabs, then?

[23:16:29] <tinwhiskers> Personally I find use of i instead of I far more offensive than shortening a word during an informal discussion. I know you're trying to improve in that regard but it should give you pause to reflect on the little habits some people have that are hard to break that don't need to be treated in such a hostile manner.

[23:54:00] <StayHungry> tinwhiskers: speaking of I
[23:54:38] <StayHungry> when I started learning English, I took a lot on faith. if that's how you're supposed to write it, I did. over time, knowledge about the world came and a comparative analysis took place. so, not only 'I' occurs too often, but also towers above the rest.
[23:54:56] <StayHungry> of course, I am familiar with the so-called typographical explanation that scribes, after abandoning ich and ic, decided to highlight that letter, but this is not very convincing when compared with one-letter pronouns in other languages.

[23:56:09] <huf> why even mention it
[23:56:21] <StayHungry> but what if some non-native is brought up in a spirit of self-restraint? then the very gut rebels at the need to give a pronoun more importance than it deserves.
