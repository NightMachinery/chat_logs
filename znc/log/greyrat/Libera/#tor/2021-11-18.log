[00:23:02] <xx> you always know who is using tor
[00:23:37] <xx> both at the endpoint, by seeing the ip address of an exit node, before the guard node, where your ISP can recognize tor traffic
[00:24:11] <Guest39> big claim :)
[00:24:24] <Guest39> tor disproved it ages ago
[00:24:42] <xx> you realize the exit node list is public, right?
[00:24:49] <Guest39> only exit yes
[00:25:25] <Guest39> blah
[00:25:26] <xx> and that tor traffic can be recognized as well, especially due to how it tries to hide itself through the announced ciphers supported (to mimic an old version of firefox)
[00:25:45] <Guest39> so what
[00:25:49] <Guest39> its 100% anon
[00:26:13] <xx> by saying that tor is 100% anonymous, you really show that you haven't looked into it enough
[00:26:32] <Guest39> well where is a pdf with those issues you claim exist?
[00:26:36] <Guest39> or any article?
[00:26:56] <Guest39> it would save time and can be posted each time
[00:27:37] <xx> https://blog.torproject.org/tors-open-research-topics-2018-edition
[00:27:42] <xx> guard discovery for example
[00:28:00] <xx> and all the traffic analysis questions
[00:28:40] <Guest39> 2018 probably fixed by now
[00:29:11] <xx> again, you show that you know very little by saying "probably fixed by now"
[00:29:16] <xx> tor is an area of active research
[00:29:32] <xx> I just hope for your own good that you're not using tor for stupid shit
[00:30:14] <nikow> All relays are open and even my wireshark recognizes tor as tor. 
[00:30:52] <nikow> There is obfs4 proxyâ€¦ but honestly, most software knows if you are not using bridge
[00:31:17] <xx> right, and the number of people who use a proper safe obfs4 proxy is miniscule
[00:31:26] <xx> *bridge
[00:31:58] <xx> because most people just click click click tor is started
[00:32:27] <xx> it's the persistent problem of being easy to use vs being secure by default
