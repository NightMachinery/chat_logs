[01:27:49] <kurahaupo> PapaChub: or until $1 is '--' of course
[01:28:33] <PapaChub> kurahaupo, :like: Yeah, and "get args" has to push them onto an ${array[@]}, I suppose, rather than "set --"'ing them back into the positional parameter list
[01:29:05] <kurahaupo> If that's what you want to do with them, yes

[01:45:15] <phogg> emanuele6: thanks for the help/explanations. It's a bit counter intuitive, and I must update a few places that I now realize are buggy. Fortunately only one allows untrusted input...

[01:46:40] <phogg> tk: I *wish* that were true
[01:46:48] <emanuele6> phogg: the -v is a little unnecessary in this case since you always have a literal [ in the argument
[01:47:01] <emanuele6> but you usually always specify -v or -f when you use unset
[01:47:04] <phogg> emanuele6: can't hurt, and it's good to be in the habit.
[01:47:25] <emanuele6> because unset can unset both functions and variable (which are in separate namespaces)
[01:47:33] <phogg> that one I knew
[01:48:20] <emanuele6> # declare -A hash=(['*']=val ['k2']=s0); unset -v hash['\*']; declare -p hash

[01:48:40] <emanuele6> # touch 'hash*'; declare -A hash=(['*']=val ['k2']=s0); unset -v hash['\*']; declare -p hash
[01:48:43] <shbot> emanuele6: bash: unset: `hash*': not a valid identifier

[01:48:52] <shbot> emanuele6: declare -A hash=(["*"]="val" [k2]="s0" )
[01:49:10] <emanuele6> also not that that appears to work, but it is broken

[02:13:40] <tk> just ask
[02:14:35] <TRS> I wanted to ask if it's possible to have a second variable passed from a file for the tcp port in the connection xvfb-run xargs -d '\n' -P10 -I{} xfreerdp /cert:ignore /u:Simulated_Failed_Logon /p:p33swor1d /v:{} < hosts
[02:15:07] <tk> so you don't need to separate it, /v:host:port works
[02:15:15] <tk> just put it in the file as host:port
[02:15:27] <TRS> for example the hosts file has hostname1.domain.com per line a second file ports has  26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 one per line
[02:15:31] <tk> oh
[02:15:44] <TRS> I would like the command to try each port per hostname
[02:16:22] <TRS> so that a connection attempt is made to hostname1.domain.com:26 and hostname1.domain.com:27 and hostname1.domain.com:28
[02:16:49] <kurahaupo> TRS: What about if you want to use an IP address instead of a hostname?
[02:16:49] <TRS> then after each port is attempted move to the next hostname
[02:17:08] <TRS> I do not, it's all hostnames
[02:17:12] <kurahaupo> tk: What about if you want to use an IP address instead of a hostname?
[02:17:13] <tk> so really you want to do:
[02:17:56] <tk> a:b \n c:d,e,f \n and convert it to a:b \n c:d \n c:e \n c:f \n

[06:12:00] <emanuele6> then why are you using that command?
[06:12:10] <TRS> I need the command to test each port in the ports files with every hostname in the hosts files

[06:27:37] <e36freak> try just the awk. does it give the output you expect?
[06:29:42] <TRS> it's outputting like so hostname1:port1:   then the next line is hostname1:port1:port2

[09:36:37] <pj> oh, it may not work for individual elements
[09:37:26] <pj> it works but it sets the entire array to integer context.

[09:39:37] <pj> declare -Ai foo works as well.
[09:40:39] <pj> tbh I prefer to not use the integer attribute, but just use $(()) for assignments like that.
[09:40:52] <pj> or ((...)) like you've used.

[09:49:30] <pj> or better yet, just avoid using the += assignment operator except in array context at all, so there's never any confusion about what it does.  foo=${foo}bar always concatenates, (( foo += bar )) always adds, and foo+=(bar) always pushes to the array regardless of variable attributes.

[22:43:21] <kurahaupo> Buffering occurs before the data is written to the pipe, so you can't blame the pipe itself
