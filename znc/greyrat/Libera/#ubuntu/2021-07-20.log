[00:30:44] <ku4eto> alright, another issue - how would i go with networkd DHCP enabled, but requesting ONLY ipv4?
[00:30:58] <ult> Hey all, thanks for the help last night, I managed to make progress. Previously I could only get the boxes to boot in rescue mode, but it turns out that 'nomodeset' will let them boot "normally" to a graphical desktop etc.
[00:31:02] <ku4eto> with [Network] DHCP=ipv4, i still get an ipv6 address
[00:31:31] <ku4eto> mind, this is with sysctl config for no ipv6

[05:53:27] <sarnold> ash_worksi: you may need to give the 'server name' if the server you're contacting is deciding what content to send you based on the Host: header sent by the client
[05:53:52] <ash_worksi> sarnold: in which file?
[05:54:13] <sarnold> ash_worksi: it's not part of a file, it's part of the url that you're giving to curl
[05:54:31] <ash_worksi> sarnold: curl works fine; I would like to see it in a browser though
[05:54:51] <ash_worksi> I don't know how to get my browser to route the same way `curl --resolve` does

[05:59:35] <sarnold> ash_worksi: so.. check the browser's configuiration to see if you're using dns over tls or dns over http; it's possible that if that's enabled it might not consult /etc/hosts at all

[09:23:21] <GBGames> So I accidentally did a Partial Upgrade and now networking doesn't work. I think that the 5.11 kernel installed doesn't have the correct driver (r8169). I can reboot and get into kernel 5.8. How straightforward is it to make my system not partially upgraded?
[09:24:02] <GBGames> That is, obviously 5.8 is still there, and I'd like it to be the default. I'm not sure how to get rid of 5.11 or if that is even what I want to do.

[09:58:35] <GBGames> So lesson learned: never say yes to a partial upgrade.

[09:59:14] <alkisg> apt upgrade means "partially update", which as you saw causes issues
[09:59:51] <lotuspsychje> oh right

[10:00:03] <alkisg> Right
[10:00:07] <GBGames> alkisg: Ah, see, I was wondering why I hadn't seen the Ubuntu Software Updater. It usually pops up with updates at least weekly. So I ran it manually, and it asked me to do the partial upgrade.
[10:00:51] <alkisg> Ah, that's usually a temporary problem in the repositories. AFAIK the updater does "full-upgrade"

[10:01:02] <GBGames> In the past, I used to run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade, and then someone long ago told me about aptitude, which I've used since. I was aware of apt, but I haven't looked into it. full-upgrade is new to me.
[10:01:07] <alkisg> So if it mentions a partial upgrade, wait for later :)
[10:01:28] <alkisg> apt-get upgrade is also bad; apt-get dist-upgrade is the "correct" one
[10:02:23] <GBGames> Huh. I always thought dist-upgrade was the "use this if you are upgrading from one version of the system to another" but I never actually dug into the details of how it worked.
[10:02:38] <alkisg> No, that's "do-release-upgrade"

[10:05:38] <GBGames> According to https://phoenixnap.com/kb/apt-vs-apt-get the difference between apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade is that the latter also removes unnecessary dependencies, and it apparently makes to full-upgrade for apt.

[10:06:03] <alkisg> The main difference to dist-upgrade is that it installs new dependencies
[10:06:25] <alkisg> So if package a version 1 goes to version 2, which requires the new package b, it will allow it
[10:06:41] <alkisg> While apt-get upgrade (or apt upgrade) will stay with a version 1
[10:07:01] <GBGames> Ah, ok.
[10:07:16] <alkisg> This is a good thing; otherwise installing new kernels wouldn't even be possible with apt  upgrade
[10:08:25] <alkisg> While apt is the "newer version" of apt-get; while apt-get will continue to be there for scripts that use it, it's recommended that sysadmins use apt

[19:58:22] <john122> hi all. I could really do with some help please. I have a GK41 mini-pc. It has an intel UDH 600 chip, an HDMI out and a DisplayPort out. The DisplayPort can't (easily) be convert to HDMI but I need two screens. The HDMI out to go to a video mixer, and I need to be able to VNC in on a second screen. I've managed to create a dummy display, but then I lost the HDMI (I've also tried a dummy DisplayPort dongle but without success).
[19:58:22] <john122>  When I tried to create an x11org.conf file with X -configure, the screen sort of worked but was a bit messed up. So I just need to be able to have a real HDMI output and a dummy VNC screen (same instance of X though, so I can control an app and tell it to put the video output on the HDMI). Can anyone help please? Thanks (20.04)

[23:10:34] <lantech19446> in other words don't short path it with ~./
[23:10:36] <RedNifre> Thanks, rbasak and enzotib, that looks like it works perfectly.
[23:11:03] <sarnold> lantech19446: right

[23:14:02] <lantech19446> /home/lamp/./goaccess.sh doesn't look right
[23:15:13] <sarnold> it would probably work, but you're right, /home/lamp/goaccess.sh is the more usual way to write that path
[23:15:28] <lantech19446> ok so it doesn't actually need to be told to execute it
[23:15:48] <sarnold> it does :)
[23:16:00] <sarnold> the ./ just says 'start the path resolution in the current working directory'
[23:16:12] <sarnold> well, strike that

[23:27:09] <lantech19446> and actually it's really good that sarnold told me to put the long path because once I su into that user ~/ wouldn't be the correct home anymore

[23:30:36] <sarnold> lantech19446: cron runs things with a different PATH than most people get with their login shells; when a cron entry doesn't work, nine times out of ten it's because someone used a relative path or didn't use a path at all when they should have :)
[23:31:41] <lantech19446> it's still not running
[23:32:52] <sarnold> maybe strip off the > /dev/null 2>&1 thing and see if it emits errors?
[23:34:07] <lantech19446> I don't think there's a mailto setup anyway but syslog says it did run and opened program by gnome shell so I don't get why it didn't work

[23:35:40] <lantech19446> fuck I need to do this whole thing in my new sudoers profile and crontab it's failing because it needs sudo to run the script
[23:35:53] <sarnold> scripts with sudo are almost always a mistake
[23:36:03] <sarnold> it's almost always better to just make the script run with whatever account it needs
[23:36:25] <lantech19446> ok I can do that easily
[23:40:08] <lantech19446> ok it's all setup to run at 315 now the interesting thing is when I saved the new crontab it inadvertently ran the script so i believe i know what the issues were now

[23:42:38] <lantech19446> so the command i'm passing through the script opens a websocket I don't need it to stay open so I want to someone pass an exit code equivalent to ^C
