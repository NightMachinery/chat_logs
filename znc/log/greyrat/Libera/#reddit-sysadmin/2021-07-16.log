[00:00:36] <vinrock> CISA just released 'mitigations and hardening guidance for msp's and small and med-sized businesses'
[00:00:43] <vinrock> basicaly warning everyone that msp's are under attack
[00:00:45] <vinrock> lol
[00:00:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[00:00:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> a little late no?
[00:00:58] <vinrock> yaknow
[00:01:22] <thegodsquirrel> The MSP I used to work for was a great group of folks but damn security....
[00:01:25] <vinrock> that kaseya attack is the only indicent ive ever been contacted by the gov about
[00:01:49] <vinrock> had to fill a questionnaire asking if we use or ever used kaseya software and some other shit
[00:04:35] <vinrock> oh look at that, at&t bought alienvault
[00:04:47] * vinrock crosses alientvault off the list
[00:05:46] <oxipital> fuck chromebooks suck
[00:05:51] <vinrock> ^
[00:06:07] <oxipital> "some media may not work for recovery"
[00:06:20] <oxipital> so i have no idea if there's a problem booting from this recovery disk
[00:06:25] <oxipital> or if its truly fucked
[00:06:43] <vinrock> boot into a live usb
[00:06:46] <vinrock> check system
[00:07:00] <oxipital> true dat
[00:07:17] <oxipital> im assumng its just a nubbin of flash memory
[00:07:18] <vinrock> i dont even fuck with chromebooks
[00:07:21] <oxipital> mount it as ext
[00:07:24] <misspwn> anyone elses service gone to shit from the sprint-tmobile merger?
[00:07:28] <vinrock> any time ive been handed one i hand it right back and tell the person they got played
[00:07:31] <oxipital> they bought them for the students
[00:07:36] <vinrock> ugh
[00:07:36] <misspwn> turning off wifi calling has helped some at home
[00:07:48] <oxipital> google must have laughed their asses off
[00:07:52] <vinrock> misspwn i want to say i recall seeing someone chating about that recently in here
[00:07:58] <oxipital> well google+their partners
[00:08:40] <oxipital> "hahahhaha pub ed bought them! they actually bought them!"
[00:08:43] <misspwn> vinrock, when we moved to the area a couple years ago one of the things i checked before buying the house was cell service. and over the past two years it's just gotten worse and worse but mainly when they started the merge
[00:08:53] <oxipital> yeah
[00:08:57] <oxipital> cell service in stl is shit
[00:09:07] <oxipital> the 5g cells are oversubscribed
[00:09:15] <misspwn> soon as i leave my subdivision it's full bars hah
[00:09:20] <oxipital> lte blocks are poorly maintained
[00:09:28] <oxipital> doesn't matter
[00:09:41] <oxipital> i can be in brentwood, full bars, speed a crawl
[00:09:43] <misspwn> yeah and they said over the phone that they are getting rid of sprint towers or whatever. but yeah soon as that tmobile chip went in it just doomed me
[00:10:02] <oxipital> my tmobile experience has been so so
[00:10:19] <misspwn> have noticed the data speeds are crawlin too when out and about. GPS can't find network most the time
[00:10:23] <oxipital> theyre affordable and no bullshit on their plans (fuck you att and verizon)
[00:10:40] <vinrock> misswn check cellmapper and see what towers are in your area
[00:10:43] <vinrock> you might be saturated
[00:10:57] <oxipital> not a lot to do though
[00:11:01] <vinrock> yeah
[00:11:09] <oxipital> contact customer service and bitch for credits
[00:11:14] <vinrock> you can though get a cell booster and a directional antenna to grab the specific tower you want
[00:12:07] <oxipital> i wonder what the level of work is expected for these pieces of shit
[00:12:17] <oxipital> they're still under warranty with hp
[00:12:32] <oxipital> but this could be fixed by nuking the internal storage..
[00:12:36] <oxipital> but that requires more work...
[00:12:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> vinrock yeah thats fun
[00:12:55] <oxipital> well this is why they pay me 50k a year

[00:19:42] <oxipital> how i hate you.
[00:20:50] <vinrock> i got the bigdogs here on board with my perspective on security
[00:21:11] <vinrock> our industry sector is under attack pretty much so we gotta stay on our toes
[00:21:15] <oxipital> whats that?
[00:21:21] <vinrock> transortation & logistics
[00:21:30] <oxipital> no your perspective
[00:21:40] <vinrock> oh, security is the absolutle most important thing
[00:21:47] * oxipital believes a secure company starts first with computer literacy
[00:21:52] <vinrock> yup
[00:21:56] <oxipital> it security is a soft it issue
[00:21:58] <oxipital> not a hard one.
[00:22:11] <oxipital> and probably more of an hr issue at first.
[00:22:15] <vinrock> idk how but even though some of the users act like retards here, every single person is on the ball with not getting baited into something
[00:22:51] <oxipital> thats what i want

But honestly the O365 I use doesn't even allow you to have a personal profile in Outlook with a work profile, so I haven't come across this before. Microsoft locks personal out once the work is added automatically
[01:40:24] <sd_> 08<a​bakedapplepie> yeah but youre also using company devices anyway, that is an option in the outlook app configuration policy to disallow additional mail profiles in outlook

[05:20:17] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> @CZ though, most people on discord use #help for doing the emergency callout

[20:21:44] <oxipital> i sat here for two hours after work waiting on this fiber asshole to finish his splice
[20:21:54] <oxipital> first we wait 30 minutes to find an extension cord
[20:22:03] <oxipital> his splicer's battery dies......magically.
[20:22:12] <teh_f4ll3n> 2 hours for a splice? what was he splicing? the entire trunk?
[20:22:17] <oxipital> then he splices, can't ge beam propagatiopn
[20:22:29] <oxipital> says "i can see my test laser hur dur"
[20:22:51] <oxipital> resplices
[20:23:04] <oxipital> hur durr not working. must be a bad strand
[20:23:24] <oxipital> then goes on to say the entire strand needs to be replaced

[20:25:17] <oxipital> i'd think you could test it somehow though
[20:25:20] <oxipital> that's my point.
[20:25:21] <mistiry> so why are you upset with this company then?
[20:25:23] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I thought there were fiber testers that could tell you the location of a fault within a few feet.
[20:25:24] <oxipital> maybe you can't
[20:25:40] <oxipital> well, more upset with my company for me having to stay
[20:25:42] <mistiry> i mean, the test laser worked right? so the test was OK, but something else is fucked
[20:25:51] <oxipital> i walked the length of the run like five tmes
[20:26:01] <oxipital> hobbled along with cane
[20:26:02] <mistiry> you were just mocking the dude 'hurr durr splicer' whatever. all of this sounds like not their fault 
[20:26:02] <vinrock> he saw the laser tho so yeah mistiry is right
[20:26:07] <oxipital> he's getting tude with that
[20:26:23] <mistiry> not his fault either
[20:26:24] <oxipital> well that's my question
[20:26:25] <sd> 02<r​yalln> yeah there are over km's
[20:26:33] <oxipital> can you test the run before hand?
[20:26:46] <oxipital> and you're right
[20:26:48] <teh_f4ll3n> if you can see the laser on the other end, it's not the strand
[20:26:51] <oxipital> its not his fault
[20:27:10] <oxipital> well apparently we wanted the fluke to show connection
[20:27:17] <vinrock> maybe hes just fuckin with you
[20:27:25] <vinrock> baaaa gotcha bro here sign this
[20:27:27] <oxipital> and the entire extension cord just kind of irked me
[20:27:38] <oxipital> 'hey do you know where i can get 100ft extension cord'?
[20:27:42] <oxipital> sp i go scrape one up
[20:27:56] <vinrock> wut you have 100; of expension cord on hand

[20:29:09] <oxipital> but i didn't bill for the time waiting on them to find it.
[20:29:10] <vinrock> getting close to lunchtime

[20:31:08] <mistiry> @bdenlinger asking for an extension cord to charge something isnt really akin to not bringing a non-electric basic tool. dude just wanted to charge his splicer somewhere, sounds like an innocent ask to me

[20:34:54] <PublicWiFi> fiber splicig isn't hard anymore if you get a splicer with a z axis
[20:35:08] * oxipital shrugs i havent been here long enough to know if i'll encounter it a lot
[20:35:23] <oxipital> see i don't know what that is
[20:35:42] <oxipital> and you know, if i'mk responsible for the work order
[20:35:52] <JollyRgrs> well there's X and Y axis... and then the third is the Z axis
[20:35:53] <oxipital> aka how much my agency spent
[20:36:15] <PublicWiFi> withuot the z axis splicer you gotta line it up and that can be tedious
[20:36:16] <JollyRgrs> it doesn't really get complicated till you start talking about 4th dimensions and higher
[20:36:33] <PublicWiFi> yeah having to bend space-time to splice is rough
[20:36:45] <mistiry> if youre responsible for the work order, then you go with what the professionals tell you is needed. get multiple quotes if you feel it necessary.
[20:37:12] <JollyRgrs> if you need a guy to splice it, you need a guy to splice it
[20:37:22] <mistiry> you had the pros come out, they tried resplicing and testing and it still doesnt work, they recommend a new run. it is what it is.
[20:37:31] <mistiry> not your fault, esp. being new, if shit is fucked
[20:37:36] <JollyRgrs> it isn't your responsibility to account for every penny of that invoice in a list of what was done every second on the job
[20:37:36] <PublicWiFi> sometimes a new run is cheaper to do to begin with depdning on the type of fiber
[20:37:46] <mistiry> now, you should make sure it gets done correctly this time, and all that
[20:38:10] <oxipital> and its coming from my budget, then yeah i have a right to be a pissant about him sitting there while i run off to find him an extension cord
[20:38:13] <mistiry> get the quotes and estimates in writing

[20:47:36] <oxipital> and blaming it on a strand afte doing 3 hours of billable work
[20:47:50] <oxipital> but it became a "you're a karen" conversation

[20:48:03] <oxipital> all you had to say.
[20:48:08] <JollyRgrs> well, you harping on the ext. cord thing and taking "marks" is what brought on the karen thing

[20:48:35] <vinrock> greenphlem, 3M Scotch permanent double sided clear mounting tape
[20:48:35] <JollyRgrs> ... and so does karen
[20:48:42] <mistiry> If asked, I would provide an extension cord. If that would take more than a few minutes, you let them know that time isn't going to be billed. If they question it, billing can fight it out. If I couldnt provide one, I would tell him so, and he can figure out what he wants to do from there.

[20:49:05] <vinrock> VHB is great but this stuff is just silly

[20:49:46] <vinrock> yeah it would be fine for that and no worries about them faling down at some point
[20:50:05] <oxipital> thats one thing i need to discuss with my boss, because i'm stuck with little authority lots of responsibiolity
[20:50:10] <JollyRgrs> surge strips aren't good past the first surge
[20:50:30] <mistiry> If you are responsible for it, that infers authority within the scope of that responsiblity
[20:50:45] <greenphlem> its not like its impossible to remove after JollyRgrs. 
[20:51:03] <oxipital> i'd think so but i havent really seen that in ;practice
[20:51:07] <JollyRgrs> so it's "not-so-permanent" permanent tape?
[20:51:21] <vinrock> you can use a prybar and just take off the laminate with it
[20:51:29] <greenphlem> ^^ :P

[21:00:57] <oxipital> then we have some nas for..something
[21:00:58] <vinrock> you kinda can
[21:00:59] <JollyRgrs> IceWreck: sounds like you are in a multi-domain environment and don't even know how to check what domain a single computer is on? sounds rought for someone who has no clue about domains at all
[21:01:02] <vinrock> if he wants to pay $500 for an AP
[21:01:51] <JollyRgrs> IceWreck: this is for sysadmins, while you are asking about something pertaining to sysadmin, it would be akin to some electrical engineer asking "guys, how do you solve for X where 2+X=3?
[21:01:54] <mistiry> X-Y problem. what are you trying to solve?
[21:02:08] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> card shop in town I'm a customer with asked for help, they're expanding into an 'event center' and want to add wifi/etc. Stupid simple, got a BoM and such, just can't get anyone quote
[21:02:20] <oxipital> fuck. this admin assistant schedules a meeting 30 minutes before its supposed to happenm
[21:02:46] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Gotta have that pre-meeting meeting
[21:02:52] *** MoonBounce is now known as Boings
[21:02:58] <Boings> so
[21:03:11] <oxipital> nah, 8:30 a meetings added to your calendar. meetings 9:00
[21:03:20] <Boings> so we got a user ticket asking for access
[21:03:23] <Boings> to some internal webapp
[21:03:24] <JollyRgrs> @onenerdyguy if you can't get ubnt hardware, i have heard rukus does real well in crowded spaces (conventions, etc.)
[21:03:28] <Boings> the problem is
[21:03:41] <Boings> no one in Operations knows wtf the web app is and the security team is freaking out
[21:03:45] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> @JollyRgrs used them before they're pretty solid.
[21:03:49] <oxipital> huh?
[21:03:58] <vinrock> how do they know about the top secret webapp
[21:04:01] <vinrock> !?
[21:04:06] <oxipital> its running on a corp machine
[21:04:10] <Boings> the developers probably just deployed it without telling anyone in Ops
[21:04:19] <oxipital> someone has admin on the machine
[21:04:20] <Boings> its in aws
[21:04:25] <oxipital> ah
[21:04:29] <Boings> they probably have admin access due to politics
[21:04:37] <JollyRgrs> s/deployed it/tested in prod... permanently
[21:04:37] <layer8> Boings meant: "the developers probably just tested in prod... permanently without telling anyone in Ops"
[21:04:39] <vinrock> ew
[21:04:53] <Boings> i mean i donnt blame them for wanting to get around the bs security review process
[21:04:55] <vinrock> man do i want a chiekn sandwich or sashimi
[21:05:06] <Boings> sashimiiii
[21:05:22] <oxipital> all the more reason that they should be hammered for installing it
[21:05:24] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> If I had a dollar for every time a test project became the production, I'd have enough money to start my own business.
[21:05:25] <Boings> seriously tho is it me or does all the new developer stuff seem to be like 
[21:05:29] <Boings> ways to get around Ops people
[21:05:31] <oxipital> the process is there for a reason
[21:05:58] <Boings> mhm
[21:06:08] <Boings> i wonder if those developers will get in trouble lol
[21:06:11] <oxipital> it puts ops as diminutive in relation to dev 
[21:06:22] <Boings> heres a fun story
[21:06:28] <oxipital> because companies like google taught everyone dev are the money makers
[21:06:36] <Boings> the developer team basically made a devops team... without letting anyone from ops know or take part in
[21:06:38] <Boings> the team
[21:06:45] <IceWreck> Yes JollyRgrs, until afew hours ago I had no idea what Active Directory was. I just want to know if I can ping all computers on the network and check what domain they are on. Also, can this be done without authentication ? 
[21:06:50] <Boings> so its a devops team..without the ops
[21:07:00] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> I mean to be fair, without dev, ops wouldn't exist.
[21:07:00] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> But they forget that without ops, dev is a messy wasteland of suck.
[21:07:04] <oxipital> its a dev team with dev/ops peop[le
[21:07:21] <Boings> yeah but they didnt bring any ops people into the team
[21:07:33] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> "messy wasteland of suck"
[21:07:35] <Boings> they literlaly just changed the titles of a bunch of developers to "devops" then requested production aws access
[21:07:36] <oxipital> i do think dev need special treatment
[21:07:47] <JollyRgrs> IceWreck: i mean, depends on how good your DNS is, you might could ping them to find out
[21:07:58] <oxipital> but really they should have their own everything
[21:07:59] <JollyRgrs> but otherwise, any access to a machine will require admin rights
[21:08:07] <oxipital> like no access to prod at all
[21:08:12] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Yeah. Just give them a dev server isolated, and let them deploy there to their hearts content.
[21:08:24] <oxipital> thats what documentation and ops troubleshooting is for
[21:08:31] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> dev's have access to dev servers, and view only to stage
[21:08:44] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> deployments should be done to staging, after testing and then pushed to prod in an automated fashion
[21:08:48] <JollyRgrs> IceWreck: are you a linux admin by trade? what were you doing prior to the world of AD?
[21:09:01] <JollyRgrs> (trying to understand your background)
[21:09:06] <oxipital> if dev isn't producing a complete package - installable etc without having a dev involved then they're doing it wrong
[21:09:19] <IceWreck> I'm not a sysadmin, I am dev but I do linux selfhosting etc as a hobby.
[21:09:33] <IceWreck> was given an AD based problem as a hackathon statement
[21:09:35] <oxipital> case. in. point.
[21:09:42] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> @IceWreck You can't do that without at least having an account IN the domain.
[21:09:58] <Boings> i wanna become more of a cloud admin
[21:10:00] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> meh, they can produce artifacts, as long as the build/test are valid and automated

[21:10:08] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> ^
[21:10:28] <JollyRgrs> as a hackathon statement? as in you're trying to infiltrate a network?
[21:11:01] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> hackathon usually just means write as much code as possible.
[21:11:09] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> in a short period of time
[21:11:19] <oxipital> Boings: same. thats where wfh and cushy jobs kick in
[21:11:19] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Not necessarily tied to actual hacking.
[21:11:30] <oxipital> they used to be
[21:11:41] <Boings> how hard is it
[21:11:44] <oxipital> college i worked at held a hacker hackathon
[21:11:45] <JollyRgrs> so more of just "hacking away at the keyboard"
[21:11:48] <Boings> to move from like a on prem sysadmin role to a more hybrid cloud role
[21:11:49] <Boings> ?
[21:12:04] <JollyRgrs> Boings: ez if you make sure to git gud?
[21:12:06] <oxipital> i think itd be easy
[21:12:15] <oxipital> just demonstrate knowledge
[21:12:21] <oxipital> learn the buzz techs
[21:12:23] <Boings> i guess I should study some azure certs spin up a cloud homelab
[21:12:38] <IceWreck> they told us that we'd have shell access to a remotes machines in some networks and we need to do regular scans of the network, save everything in elastisearch and make sure computers are sortable by IP, AD domain, mac and hostname
[21:12:41] <Boings> yea i really wanna learn it and i feel I'm not going to learn it at my current place
[21:12:41] <JollyRgrs> the thing is azure/google/AWS are all different in how they do things, but there are some common ideas behind them all
[21:12:42] <oxipital> nah spin up a clpoud project
[21:12:46] <IceWreck> JollyRgrs sd
[21:12:53] <Boings> im a windows admin so I'd prefer to learn azure
[21:12:58] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I moved from support to devops because I had tons of product knowledge
[21:13:02] <JollyRgrs> but really, just find the companies that want to just "lift and shift" to the cloud b/c some CIO/CTO wants to look good on their resume
[21:13:06] <oxipital> set up a project of some form.
[21:13:08] <JollyRgrs> then you don't have to really do much work at all
[21:13:16] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I think it's easier to do devops in a company that is purely customer driven
[21:13:17] <Boings> also it seems that
[21:13:23] <Boings> cloud type roles have much more flexibility and WFH
[21:13:26] <Boings> so thats def nice
[21:13:27] <oxipital> even if its a damn web media library
[21:13:37] <oxipital> integrates multiple shit
[21:13:47] <oxipital> shows you know enough to complete work
[21:14:08] <oxipital> i'd say thats good enough for an intro
[21:14:18] <oxipital> or level 1 cloud admin gig
[21:14:19] <JollyRgrs> well, by the nature, cloud means you gotta go outside your org to log into their management... so it is much easier for an org to say "well, you don't have to be on prem for security" (which is dumb as it is, I know)
[21:14:20] <IceWreck> JollyRgrs sd so the rest I can do but have no idea how to find out a computer's active directory domain by remote scan without being in the network.
[21:14:28] <Boings> should I bother getting certs?
[21:14:34] <oxipital> i dunno
[21:14:41] <oxipital> thats like a question with any it job
[21:14:42] <Boings> i do have free microsoft cert tests
[21:14:44] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> If someone else pays for them sure
[21:14:51] <oxipital> if they're free then yes
[21:14:52] <Boings> yeah i have free vouchers so might as well use them i guess
[21:14:55] <JollyRgrs> Boings: IME certs are only ever good if you have no exp. on your resume
[21:14:55] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I did a ton of free certs via ESI
[21:15:00] <Boings> i have like
[21:15:06] <Boings> 3-4 years of experience as a sysadmin
[21:15:20] <Boings> but a good 20-30% of that is doing helpdesk too tbh
[21:15:36] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> If you're looking to jump try something cloud agnostic like Terraform or a Red Hat cert
[21:15:39] <oxipital> word
[21:15:57] <Boings> tbh the main reason i want to leave my current place is that
[21:16:00] <oxipital> being stuck in the netherworld of hd/sa is a career killer
[21:16:14] <Boings> i feel that my current place uses too much legacy shit
[21:16:17] <Boings> does things the old way
[21:16:18] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I've been wishing for the giac cloud security essentials cert but my employer won't pay.

[21:16:33] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> yes my reason for leaving is the same
[21:16:35] <Boings> like I've put in effort to try to do things the "modern" way
[21:16:39] <Boings> but it gets rejected cause of
[21:16:40] <Boings> politics

[23:01:54] <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, is this due to racism, or?
[23:02:06] <fritzwastaken> wat?
[23:02:19] <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, why aren't you using lip plates?
[23:02:25] <shibboleth> you have anything against african?
[23:02:25] <fritzwastaken> wat
[23:02:27] <PrincessZoey> I'm so lost
[23:02:29] <shibboleth> you don't trust them?
[23:02:30] <fritzwastaken> me too
[23:02:32] <shibboleth> i'm kidding
[23:02:33] <fritzwastaken> wat?
[23:02:45] <PrincessZoey> If you're trying to troll you fucking suck at it
[23:02:59] <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, but if were some militant wokeist i'd have you in a bind there :)
[23:03:08] <shibboleth> if i was even
[23:03:15] <fritzwastaken> wat?
[23:03:52] <shibboleth> you said: i do x because y also do it, they're smart, i trust them
[23:04:02] <shibboleth> now, do the math
[23:04:28] <PrincessZoey> Anyone else smell burnt toast?
[23:04:30] <fritzwastaken> wat?
[23:05:04] <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, you know, hearing-issues don't really translate to a written medium.
[23:05:34] <fritzwastaken> Oh this isnt hearing related, its comprehention related
[23:05:40] <shibboleth> <fritzwastaken> Asians wear masks normally, I trust them
[23:05:43] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, don't you trust africans?
[23:05:50] <fritzwastaken> and?
[23:05:51] <shibboleth> et cetera
[23:06:11] <fritzwastaken> Still dont get your point, what was the objective of this?
[23:06:17] <fritzwastaken> Have you acheivd your goal?
[23:06:33] <shibboleth> well, i could try and explain with sock-puppets, but eh...
[23:06:55] <vinrock> s/puppets/poopets
[23:06:55] <layer8> shibboleth meant: "well, i could try and explain with sock-poopets, but eh..."
[23:07:15] <fritzwastaken> Oh no, I get what you were going for. It just has no point and fell flat
[23:07:19] <fritzwastaken> sry bout that
[23:07:36] * fritzwastaken pats shibboleth on the head
[23:07:40] <shibboleth> so you got it even though it had no point?
[23:07:42] <fritzwastaken> Next time it might pan out a little better
[23:07:42] <shibboleth> good job
[23:08:10] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> day 5 of discontinuing Windows 10 in favor of Rocky Linux on my office workstation
[23:08:15] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> don't fucking miss anything
[23:08:51] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> even the printer was easier to set up on here
[23:12:29] <vinrock> didnt know about rocky linux
[23:12:35] <vinrock> thats cool
[23:12:42] <vinrock> im just moving us to rhel
[23:13:03] <PrincessZoey> Just install gentoo on everything
[23:13:15] <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, i could say i'm confused, but that would be disingenuous. so you got the meaning all along, you just pretended multiple times that you didn't because it had no point even though you got the point?
[23:13:30] <shibboleth> right, i see...
[23:17:10] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> vinrock: ye it pretty much just released
[23:17:39] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> I didn't want to use up our free production-use seats for rhel for my own workstation though so I decided on rocky
[23:18:04] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> only downside so far with not using windows was our usage of Sonicwall firewall
[23:18:07] <PrincessZoey> I have arch on my laptop right now
[23:18:26] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> firewall's* groupvpn/ipsec vpn feature. not supported with a client in linux so I had to make a private ssl-vpn deployment for now
[23:19:15] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> I spent 90% of my time (not including the 95% of my workday wasted by windows fucking shit up really badly requiring restarts and what not) in WSL terminals anyways. Now I don't have to deal with that
