[00:23:19] <Alipha> iirc, Intel determined 8 hyperthreaded cores had about 20% performance gain over 4 normal cores with minimal additional cost. So 20% doesn't sound like much, but it was basically free. This also means cpus spend about 40% of their time stalled

[00:46:34] <great_taste> programming is painful
[00:46:38] <great_taste> very much so at times
[00:46:45] <CarloWood> Why?
[00:46:57] <CarloWood> You confuse me.
[00:47:28] <great_taste> but when you have the driving force, a strong motivation and desire to get things done, you plough through it
[00:47:57] <great_taste> because it's difficult man... is programming too easy for you?
[00:48:14] <great_taste> There are times I get stuck on problems and become hopeless lol
[00:48:42] <CarloWood> Hmm, the trick is (for me) to have no dead line.
[00:49:04] <great_taste> I have no deadline, but I want to make progress
[00:49:32] <CarloWood> Almost no goal as it were. No matter how hard to problem; it is solvable with enough time. If need be I read and read and read. I just keep reading documentation, examples, tutorials and talking with experts until the problem is solved.
[00:50:28] <CarloWood> What *is* a (huge) problem for me is that I'm getting old. I think I'm on my Last Project. If I ever finish this at all, after this one I can't start a new one because I'll be senile or dead. :(
[00:50:32] <great_taste> yes with enough time and money, anything is possible
[00:50:34] <CarloWood> That puts pressure on me.
[00:50:41] <CarloWood> It's a dead line after all.
[00:50:46] <CarloWood> Quite literall.

[00:52:03] <CarloWood> yeah - I'll have to get used to the idea to not finishing what I am working on, or the rest of my life will be a hell from some point onwards.

[00:53:12] <great_taste> nothing is done for nothing, you always gain something
[00:53:29] <CarloWood> But what I have worked on was always very complex and invisible: aimed at increasing productivity, or robustness of a project.  Networking code at best.
[00:54:16] <CarloWood> Now I started to learn vulkan and I'm coding something that should result in something visible at least. Then I can make youtubes of it :). And then it doesn't matter how difficult and complex it is: people will be able to see what I did.

[01:04:20] <jbalint> I've factored out some logic from a class BigClass into a new class called Logic. now BigClass needs a Logic instance. I'm struggling to decide how to a) allow existing code not require to pass a Logic instance (we can construct some "default") instance and b) allow new code to pass a Logic instance if it wishes
[01:04:29] <jbalint> should I just duplicate the constructor with all initializers?

[01:06:10] <CarloWood> jbalint: maybe BigClass::BigClass(Logic const& logic = Logic()); ?
[01:06:35] <jbalint> can the default value "expression" be an arbitrary function call?
[01:06:48] <jbalint> I was thinking along those lines, let me try that out
[01:07:36] <CarloWood> The immediate "downside" that comes to mind is that user is then responsible for making the life time of the passed Logic object longer than the BigClass one.
[01:08:05] <jbalint> if it works, it at least narrows the problem a bit ^_^
[01:08:13] <CarloWood> But well - I do that all the time. Users need to take their responsibility :P
[01:08:47] <CarloWood> On the upside, you can make Logic abstract and let them derive their own class from it and then pass that.
[01:09:13] <jbalint> right, that's the idea
[01:10:19] <CarloWood> My current code does something similar - didn't give it much thought though. But, it allows "users" (of the common API) to derive from a Window base class and pass that to the "library" code, as follows:
[01:11:39] <CarloWood> Case 1: pass the type(s), and let the library (BigClass) do the creation. This requires a fixed constructor signature:
[01:11:42] <CarloWood> auto root_window1 = application.create_root_window<WindowEvents, Window>({1000, 800}, LogicalDevice::root_window_cookie1);
[01:12:11] <CarloWood> Case 2: pass a unique_ptr; this allows any constructor to be used (by the user):
[01:12:22] <CarloWood> auto logical_device = application.create_logical_device(std::make_unique<LogicalDevice>(), std::move(root_window1));
[01:13:23] <CarloWood> If you think your users might go wild with Logic derived classes, with arbitrary constructor signatures, the latter would perhaps translate into something like:
[01:13:23] <jbalint> LogicalDevice has a default ctor?
[01:13:39] <CarloWood> It has here, but you could pass anything.
[01:14:04] <CarloWood> I did choose to do all user configurable stuff through virtual functions.
[01:14:52] <CarloWood> LogicalDevice is a user class with a virtual function for anything that they want to configure; not overriding a virtual function then gives the default behavior.
[01:15:50] <CarloWood> So:  application.create_bigclass(std::make_unique<MyLogic>(my_constructor_args), ...);
[01:16:56] <CarloWood> and maybe in MyLogic:  int number_of_foobars() override { return 10; } // The default of 3 is too small.
[01:18:04] <jbalint> ok, let me try out some of these. thanks for the ideas

[01:19:40] <CarloWood> jbalint: In the case of the fixed constructor signature (the first case), the user class just inherits all constructors; like so:
[01:19:50] <CarloWood> class Window : public task::SynchronousWindow {
[01:19:57] <CarloWood>  public:
[01:19:57] <CarloWood>   using task::SynchronousWindow::SynchronousWindow;
[01:20:19] <CarloWood> That way they very easily have the same (required) constructor signatures.

[10:28:32] <kalven> less typing
[10:29:07] <very_sneaky> it's much of a muchness to me, it's just telling cmake which one to use
[10:31:16] <kalven> yeah but cmake does makefiles if you tell it nothing :D
[10:31:28] <kalven> and make is one less char.. oth, ninja -j's by default
[10:33:12] <very_sneaky> yeah that might be one benefit. i could have sworn that when you use cmake with conan you get -j$(nproc), but i can't find it any of the resulting CMakeFiles, and it certainly seems like llvm is building single threaded for me now
[10:33:52] <very_sneaky> though, by itself that doesn't seem like a huge reason to switch - surely there's just a config value i can set to enforce that if it's not default
[10:34:04] <very_sneaky> maybe it being cross-platform has some value
[10:34:58] <very_sneaky> this certainly seems to indicate that conan is setting j$(nproc) https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/1151#issuecomment-294979627

[10:48:36] <very_sneaky> https://david.rothlis.net/ninja-benchmark/ maybe this is a better comparison
[10:48:44] <kalven> iirc it was made for chromium (which is humongous)
[10:48:55] <very_sneaky> fresh build time performance is marginal, but the incremental build time is vastly improved in large projects
[10:49:26] <very_sneaky> for projects in the order of 100,000 files, anyway
[10:49:58] <kalven> which are few and far between. but if you happen to be working on one...
[10:50:31] <very_sneaky> yeah, i can imagine it would get frustrating if you're changing a single line and want to run the tests multiple times per minute
[10:53:57] <very_sneaky> dang, there's such a difference between parallel and non parallel build times
[10:54:29] <kalven> are you building llvm?
[10:54:38] <very_sneaky> yeah
[10:55:40] <very_sneaky> seems to be a pretty large memory footprint for parallel builds though

[15:57:09] *** Terminus- is now known as Terminus
[15:59:48] <very_sneaky> leak is bundled into address sanitizer i think
[16:00:00] <very_sneaky> address sanitizer won't run with memory or thread sanitizers
[16:00:23] <very_sneaky> i think? maybe unless specifically passed as an argument, but i'm not 100% sure

[16:02:30] <ville> it seems LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=name.txt

[16:08:09] <very_sneaky>            Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.  This option only matters for linking of executables and the executable is linked against a library that overrides "malloc" and other allocator functions.  See

[16:08:26] <very_sneaky> "The option cannot be combined with -fsanitize=thread`
[16:09:02] <very_sneaky> there are other exclusory options, but i can't find thepage that laid it out clearly now
[16:09:12] <ville> what are you on about?
[16:10:15] <very_sneaky> i misinterpreted your question. thought you were asking why it wasn't showing stuff you wanted it to :)
[16:10:25] <ville> i know that not all sanitizers may be enabled at the same time. not what i was asking about. i was asking about surppressing output from leak sanitizer as it's output for code i can't control/fix, which is making it more difficult to react to relevant messages
[16:10:44] <very_sneaky> yeah i got that from a second read.
