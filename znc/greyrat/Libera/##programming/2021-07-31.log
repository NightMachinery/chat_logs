[00:25:55] <oldlaptop> user51: A machine like this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Linotype_Simplex_1895.JPG would be used to cast a slug like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Linotype_Zeilenblock_Frontansicht.jpg for each line

[02:55:00] <pulse> even with all the things i hate about web, i still prefer it the way it is :p
[02:55:08] <pulse> websites can be designed to be a full blown webapps
[02:55:15] <pulse> it's nutty
[02:55:25] <pulse> and it's a good playing fields for UX designers
[02:55:33] <pulse> far more expressive than the traditional UI methods
[02:55:37] <eyynet4> websites are wasting all my CPU cycles on logging key and mouse events
[02:55:43] <pulse> which are extremely restrictive and require special hacks to get around those restraints
[02:55:52] <eyynet4> for what benefit??
[02:55:54] <pyzozord> eyynet4: or mining bitcoines
[02:57:10] <Arahael> pulse: I disagree, though that said I'm not a UI designer myself, though I do work with them.
[02:57:11] <pavonia> eyynet4: It's for your best! Optimizing your user experience etc.
[02:57:16] <pyzozord> I also feel that CLIs and TUIs were the best UIs. Those and printed documents
[02:58:14] <pulse> Arahael, a website's design is a part of the product's identity, it's important
[02:58:17] <pyzozord> pavonia: rather optimizing where you shuld be clicking. Where they want you to click
[02:58:44] <Arahael> pulse: That's different to an "App", though.
[02:59:11] <pyzozord> well i guess that's not fair, the same attitude comes across in other types of media too
[02:59:18] <pulse> i work with a marketing team and i can tell you from first hand experience what kind of difference a good design makes in terms of user retention time
[02:59:29] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[02:59:55] <pulse> a good design easily doubles it, and that translates to more people using your product
[02:59:58] <pulse> more people talking about it, and so on
[03:00:03] <pulse> design is important
[03:00:08] <cq-work> "good" and "design" are trigger words, can we please refrain. I get depressed when people talk about it.
[03:00:14] <Arahael> pulse: "user retention" is... Imho problematic.  Facebook and twitter do well there, but they use phycologial tricks such as infinite design, etc.  tiktok is a plague.
[03:00:30] <pulse> cq-work, there's some wiggle room but any skilled designer can tell you the difference between good and bad design almost immediately
[03:00:36] <Arahael> pulse: As a user, I just want to 1. Go to a site, and 2. Get what i want form it.
[03:00:40] <eyynet4> is it good design to load a bunch of blank elements instantly, then lazy load them over th next 30 seconds while blasting users with adverts
[03:00:52] <pulse> Arahael, true but you're not looking at the big picture. you're one user
[03:01:00] <pulse> if you want your product to be successful, you better consider design too
[03:01:18] <pulse> eyynet4, no
[03:01:19] <Arahael> pulse: I think you're conflating a website with one's product.
[03:01:29] <pulse> website is a strong part of any product
[03:01:34] <cq-work> I definnitely see a trend of just ignoring any designing and pooping out code as fast as possible with literally no attempt at design.
[03:01:48] <pulse> it's the thing that connects your product to the outside world, it's kinda important in that regard
[03:02:07] <pulse> cq-work, that doesn't mean good design doesn't exist, or good UX within good design doesn't exist
[03:02:13] *** Quits: zaher (~zaher@37.48.186.53) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:02:16] <piou> I agree that good design is important, but the trends we see such as using JS where simple HTTP would work is not good design, it's restrictive design that does not do well with people that have a lesser internet connection (ie: most of the world) or with disabled people (it's hard for automated software to pickup what you can click on if it's not a proper HTML element).
[03:02:25] <pulse> current web trends are awful
[03:02:27] <cq-work> You don't see that in large companies so much but startups which ironically have a crazy high failure rate seem to love it.
[03:02:27] <pulse> i'm not defending those
[03:02:30] <Arahael> pulse: ^^ I'm disabled, myself.
[03:02:34] <pulse> but i'm claiming that good design is possible
[03:02:52] <pulse> good design follows all the UX principles in the book, and is visually interesting
[03:02:54] <Arahael> pulse: It's certainly possible, just most websites do a shitty job at it and it's inconsistent!
[03:02:56] <pulse> that's all it should really do
[03:03:10] <piou> That it certainly is, but it's not encouraged by the tools at the dev's disposal either and people take the path of least resistance
[03:03:17] <pulse> Arahael, of course. most of the web is absolutely horrible

[03:18:22] <pulse> well i'm not a fan of having apps built on the document model but that's how we have it currently

[03:18:34] *** Joins: zaher_ (~zaher@37.48.189.38)
[03:18:46] <pulse> remember the security issues with java, flash or activex applets
[03:18:55] <pulse> at least the modern web is somewhat patched in that regard
[03:19:21] <Izem> no one wants to change it, it's better for those who don't want to depend on windows/macos
[03:19:23] <pulse> or silverlight
[03:19:40] <pulse> a universal app platform should exist for the web
[03:19:51] <Arahael> pulse: All these are for apps. I'm only talking about content pages - what the web should have been.
[03:19:58] <pulse> but attempts so far have ranged from terrible to disastrous
[03:20:02] <Izem> yes, but vendors
[03:20:02] <Arahael> pulse: And yeah, but an app platform is a separate thing./
[03:20:23] <Izem> Arahael: I think he just means network ready?
[03:20:36] <pulse> i mean accessible through http(s)

[03:20:47] <Arahael> Izem: "network ready?"  But yes, pulse seems to be blending together multiple things that happen to use the modern web.
[03:20:48] <Izem> yeah that's what I thought
[03:21:02] <Arahael> pulse: Again, http(s) is just a technical detail.
[03:21:20] <Izem> yes, transport should not matter
[03:21:20] <pulse> it's all part of the web ecosystem
[03:21:30] <pulse> from static websites all the way to full blown user facing apps
[03:21:33] <pyzozord> I'm of opinion that stack overflow is terrible. I still use it though, but only because web frameworks are terrible too so my work is terrible
[03:21:49] <Arahael> pyzozord: I'm in the top 8% on stack overflow and I agree it's terrible.
[03:21:50] <Izem> so is ok
[03:21:50] <pulse> pyzozord, why? it's one of the more useful sites out there
[03:21:57] <pulse> alongside with google and wolframalpha
[03:22:08] <Izem> I'd use it for end user support ngl
[03:22:08] <pyzozord> And I'm not motivated enough to read the documentation and learn those frameworks properly since they will be gone tomorrow
[03:22:18] <Izem> oof
[03:22:30] <pyzozord> Arahael: oh wow, that's pretty cool :)

[03:24:43] <piou> Arahael: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SweeWqI6Vlg&pp=sAQA -> probably not your jam but at least I know it also has captions for you to test
[03:24:46] <pyzozord> That's true. But I generally believe in 'via negativa' evolution. Like with stopping using goto lead to structured programming etc
[03:24:55] <Arahael> piou: Awesome.

[03:29:47] <pyzozord> Ideally I'd prefer to have .txt versions and just use grep

[12:15:35] <mrig> discrimination is inevitable, it is the lack of wisdom in the process that is problematic, I find.

GRUB provides for the client to first ask for a file with a suffic including its UUID, or MAC address, or IP addresses, but tcpdump showed it
[13:32:47] <TJ-> only ever asks for grub.cfg. Was analysing grub source to see under what circumstances it might not do it. After 5 hours just spotted the code was only added recently (had thought it was around for years!) and therefore isn't in Debian's grub 2.04 (arrived in 2.06-rc1) !!

[15:43:48] <Rounin> user51: If they're variable size and you're not maintaining a list, then obviously you don't know... But your idea of using binary search should work as long as they're all sorted

[15:44:14] <Rounin> user51: It would hit the cache a lot, though
[15:44:16] <user51> so i was wondering, if i had any point, if there was a way to find to which segment it belongs to
[15:44:20] <bjs> user51: well, for binary search (over the segments) to work you need to be able to tell from a segment where it starts/stops
[15:44:40] <bjs> user51: do you have some kind of data structure that stores information about the segments in some easy way?
[15:44:48] <GeDaMo> 100 bytes is pretty small, a linear search is probably the best idea
[15:45:09] <Rounin> Not to mention "don't use a bunch of variable-size memory segments"
[15:45:22] <Rounin> But I guess with 100 bytes, we're conserving space
[15:45:48] <Rounin> We're not paging in gigabytes of memory from disk here
[15:45:57] <user51> my non-binary search solution is to use a specific number of bits (2^Nsegments) then you could say, use something like & to match the segment ID
[15:46:11] <bjs> user51: you can basically make this operation as fast as you want, by choosing to store more metadata somewhere
[15:46:47] <Rounin> Theoretically, searching through the metadata would also take time :P
[15:46:50] <GeDaMo> user51: wouldn't that make the segments the same size?
[15:47:04] <bjs> Rounin: you can remove "searching" though if you wanted and make it O(1)
[15:47:25] <GeDaMo> O(1) doesn't mean 'faster' though
[15:47:27] <bjs> it's always about trade-offs, how much overhead can you accept, _how_ "variable" do you need the sizes to be
[15:47:57] <bjs> GeDaMo: I mean sure but you're being a bit pedantic here, clearly a constant time lookup of some metadata is going to be faster than any kind of search
[15:48:03] <bjs> s/a bit/painfully/
[15:48:56] <GeDaMo> I think it'd be difficult to create metadata that would beat a linear search of 100 bytes for speed
[15:49:21] <GeDaMo> It's less than 2 cache lines
[15:49:25] <bjs> GeDaMo: I don't think user51 really meant they only had 100 bytes, they just used it as an example
[15:51:09] <user51> well, the simpliest although not memory effective solution i have is an array mapping points to segments

If you store (start, stop) you can do a binary search: [(0, 10), (10, 40), (40, 90), (90, 100)],  you could also store bitmaps of byte -> segment

[16:29:16] <GeDaMo> bitset is the array, setchars[i] is the character we're working on
[16:29:43] <GeDaMo> setchars[i] >> 6 gives us the upper 2 bits

[16:32:44] <GeDaMo> If it just used 1, it would default to a 32 bit int and shifting beyond 32 bits wouldn't work correctly

[16:53:14] <pyzozord> One more thing I'm not sure about. The top two bits can be 00, 01, 10, 11. So 0-4. You only take lower one of those two to index into the bitset. Then you take the lower 6 bits of the character and you check if the appropriate bit is set in that part of the bitset. Aren't you losing information about the most significant bit of the character?

[16:56:07] <pyzozord> that is pretty fast O(1) lookup. But i think the point is that this is also small O(1) memory footprint which makes it fit into cache lines which makes the whole thing extremly fast
[16:56:41] <GeDaMo> Yeah, the table should fit into a single cache line
[16:56:57] <pyzozord> sorry I guess the lookup is O(n) where n is the number of characters in the searchee string
[16:57:12] <pyzozord> *lookup time
[16:58:34] <pyzozord> this is like a trie + hashmap, where trie is 1 level only and hashmap computes hash based on lower 6 bits, and the hashmap value is just boolean exists or doesn't exist

[17:36:38] <pyzozord> Arahael: yeah I think in all companies I worked for we had a k8s pod with nginx that the CDN talked to. I'm not sure why though. Outside of the usefulness of nginx for things like redirects, changing access permissions, managing http header reponses etc, there isn't really much use for it. Files must be served, that's pretty much 90% of what needs to happen
[17:38:08] <Arahael> pyzozord: That's because you're thinking like a software developer, and not like a system admin.  It's much easier to manage with generic tools, and that does mean slapping on nginx or something on everyhting - and nginx really is production grade - your little express server is not going to be that great compared to what nginx is likely able to do out of the box.

[17:41:39] <pyzozord> Arahael: yes that was my idea. Make frontend (static files) and upload them to CDN. From there browser loads those static files and javascript can execute and make requests to backend services. How backend services are hosted I wasn't concerned

[18:53:28] <user51> sometimes i wonder if shift/control and the such should be toggle rather than press and hold
[18:53:46] <user51> well, caps lock exists

[18:55:24] <pyzozord> sandman13: I do use that when I use vscode. At this point I am so used to vi key bindings, that normal text editors feel very awkward
[18:55:24] <deniska> neovim has an API via which you can control a running instance
[18:55:48] <deniska> and I think they're switching to lua from viml for new stuff?
[18:56:13] <sandman13> Yeah.

[18:56:57] <pyzozord> but the vscode experience is pretty bad. So many buttons features statuses, nuts and bolts... It's just too much
[18:57:12] <pyzozord> And it can be slow
[18:57:13] <sandman13> Still there are few problems. Enabling syntax on long lines slows down (neo)vim. Poor support for Indic fonts
[18:58:25] <pyzozord> I don't use syntax highlighting at all. But I am considering writing a very simple word highlighter for my vi fork. Just so that it prints keywords in bold font
[18:58:30] <pyzozord> but no colors

[21:41:42] <mrig> if I didn't have tabs I'd probably do that instead, seems to amount to the same thing.
[21:41:54] <mrig> but dont tend to use them that often.
[21:41:57] <dunkeln> i face the same....if there are just too many buffers i quit and open a new vim session
[21:42:11] <mrig> you can close them.
[21:42:20] <mrig> I never learned how to :|
[21:42:23] <dunkeln> yeah but you get carried away uk
[21:42:29] <dunkeln> mrig: haha
[21:43:03] <mrig> there is a clear all buffers except the current one call, if memory serves.
[21:43:12] <dunkeln> telescope is just fantastic for buffer navigation
[21:44:23] <xeno> mrig: in vim? you just do :q ?
[21:45:12] <dunkeln> mrig: its the frustration that goes away when you just go "aaargggh" and close it...kinda like sweeping everything off an unorganized table
[21:45:14] <mrig> dang; I was wondering how to turn this darn thing off!
[21:45:17] <dunkeln> feels great
[21:47:23] <mrig> ah its is with bufdo that you can close all, requires a little script to keep the current one open.

[22:59:01] <bjs> gitesh: an event is just "something that happens" https://www.dictionary.com/browse/event . Almost everything is an event of some kind
[23:00:19] <bjs> the point of event-driven programming (I guess the real core of your question) is to treat events ("things that happen") as the core concept. Instead of writing programs that make events happen, you write programs that deal with events when they happen.  It's just looking at things a different way.
