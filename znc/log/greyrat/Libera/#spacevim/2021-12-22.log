[22:22:15] <SpaceVimBot> <Serj_2> Greetings! I have a question about executing code from spacevim. 
[22:22:16] <SpaceVimBot> <Serj_2> My code consumes arguments in the form of sys.argv[1]
[22:22:18] <SpaceVimBot> <Serj_2> Is there a way to pass that from within spacevim?
[22:24:09] <SpaceVimBot> <Serj_2> Unfortunately googling it only shows results for passing arguments to vim itself, which is not what I want
[22:29:06] <SpaceVimBot> <Serj_2> Aha, task system. Never mind, I found the answer to my question in the docs.
