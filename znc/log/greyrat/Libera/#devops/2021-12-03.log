[16:41:30] <shad> Hi, one of my difficulties in my job is to coming up with names
[16:42:00] <shad> I've developed a full stack app in multiple repos eg: "api", "front", "agent", 3 repos in a Gitlab subdirectory
[16:42:24] <shad> I wanna add a fourth one with the kubernetes Kustomize deployment, how do I name it ? 
[16:43:20] <shad> `deployment` could work, but it is the name of one of my k8s resource, and that repo will contain ingresses, services, deployment etc..
[16:43:35] <shad> `my-proj/kustomize`... meh
[16:43:44] <shad> `my-proj/k8s` also meh

[18:42:23] <slaughter> shad Is the repo just going to be the config for k8s or does it contain an actual app/logic>
[18:43:39] <slaughter> Also for api/front/agent - I'd personally rename those to something slightly more descriptive. "user-api" "website-frontend" "data-agent". If you ever make a second API (or third or fourth) or anything you're going to regret not being more descriptive
[19:07:30] <shad> slaughter: everything is in a gitlab directory, so it's `my-proj/api` `my-proj/front` `my-proj/agent`. Its also IT Tooling for use inside my org so i don't think it will expand to more than these 3 projects
[19:08:10] <shad> And yeah, that repo is supposed to be used like `kubectl apply -k . -n my-proj` to deploy in production. I haven't figured out yet how to make kustomize overlays for dev/stage/prod env, but i don't think i'll be needing those anyway too
[19:08:37] <shad> for now i've named it `my-proj/k8s` but... meh
[19:21:58] <slaughter> Ah ok if it's already namespaced like that then it's probably fine. I'd still add it to the repos personally, but I'm a big fan of explicit everything.
[19:22:24] <slaughter> I'd say k8s or config or something similar makes sense, especially considering your other naming
