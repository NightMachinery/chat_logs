[11:36:08] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: firefox and chrome extensions are not perfectly interchangeable for a couple reasons...
[11:36:08] <Caspy7[m]> The main one has to do with their format or something, like their description file is different. So while the main code could be identical, there's that incompatibility
[11:36:08] <Caspy7[m]> Also Firefox supports some APIs that Chrome doesn't.
[11:36:49] <Caspy7[m]> and there's some addons that Mozilla won't allow on their addons site that chrome will (mostly privacy reasons I think)
[11:37:50] <Caspy7[m]> there was actually an extension that converted Chrome extensions into Firefox extensions there for a while, but it stopped working. I don't know the details (it didn't always work either)
[11:38:07] <Mo> Ok, thanks.
[11:39:13] <Mo> While looking for the addon Tab Mix Plus on recent FF I found: https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus  That means there is a version working with recent firefox, but requires some Legacy extensions loader.

[11:58:33] <Mo> On Gentoo I can get 2 version slots:  (esr)  91.7.0   and   unstable ~98.0 (which is upstream stable afaik). Which version should I go for when using Firefox as my main working production browser?
[12:00:06] *** Joins: zibolo (~quassel@global-deiInside018.dei.polimi.it)
[12:00:41] <Cork> Mo: "unstable" is the standard firefox esr is the Enterprice Release
[12:00:55] <Cork> pick what ever you want to use they are both supported upstream
[12:05:18] <Mo> This is a good hint about that: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/choosing-firefox-update-channel
[12:29:11] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: the average user might find ESR frustrating as new versions of Firefox sometimes have desirable features and performance improvements. ESR is usually the choice of a business or organization because *they* want the extreme stability in design (i.e. lack of changes)
[12:29:57] <Caspy7[m]> reminds me of when wasm support came out and missed the ESR release

[12:32:39] <juippis> Mo: gentoo allows you to choose, but I'd advise you to follow your natural keywords selection for the "best" experience. If you're in stable you get esr naturally, and if you're in unstable you get rapid naturally
[12:34:26] <juippis> rapid is the feature release so as said by Caspy7[m] you get new features, but it's also buggier and generally has more updates. So if you don't want to compile firefox each week, maybe esr suits you better
[12:35:27] <Caspy7[m]> I expect "each week" is not very accurate
[12:41:07] <juippis> Mo: also --sync before you install, 91.7.1 and 98.0.1 are already available :P
[12:42:46] <Mo> juippis: My setup is almost amd64 stable, but as for firefox I'm going to accept unstable ~amd64 to get the 98.0. And I'm going to enable LTO for testing..

[13:04:21] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: it's not possible anymore because the legacy extensions were removed (they were powerful - too powerful) but something similar can probably be accomplished with CSS. You can search or post in https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/ or chat in #firefoxcss:mozilla.org on Mozilla's matrix chat server https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#firefoxcss:mozilla.org
[13:06:05] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: Well, as for the  https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus I got that working with the legacy extension. :)
[13:07:18] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: by using Nightly build? Unbranded?
[13:07:24] <susi> you can have thin tabs with just userChrome.css
[13:07:50] <susi> r/FirefoxCSS is full of those 
[13:08:55] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: I followed the Installataion guide, installed bootstrapLoader.xpi, then the last TabMixPlus-dev-pre build.
[13:09:44] <Mo> btw. playing around with the UI, I tried browser.proton.enabled false, then restarted, but I don't see any difference.
[13:10:57] <Caspy7[m]> they probably removed the old code cause they're not going to support everything infinitely and that pref does nothing now
[13:11:05] <Mo> maybe.
[13:11:42] <Mo> susi: You mean I search https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/ for such a css for small tabs?
[13:11:54] <Caspy7[m]> ooor it's a conspiracy against you (that's probably it)

[13:32:19] <Caspy7[m]> I suggest using one with very obvious effects posted to the subreddit I linked. If it's being used then you'll know it's working in general
[13:35:17] <Mo> Caspy7[m], susi: In the developer tools Style editor, if I apply my .css manually, it works. But it's not used at start.
[13:38:11] <Mo> Ok, I did it wrong, here is the guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/
[13:44:19] <Mo> In that tutorial, what does not work is, "Testing y style". Changing the css code there doesn't apply, and doing save doesn't save.
[13:44:49] <Mo> However after moving that userChrome.css to subdir chrome/, it is loaded at startup.
[13:45:20] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: that tutorial says you can make changes in devtools and they will be saved to the userChrome.css file??
[13:45:59] <Mo> Yes.
[13:47:58] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: is that wrong?
[13:48:14] <Caspy7[m]> fairly sure it is
[13:48:43] <Caspy7[m]> like I said, you'll probably get better expertise on the topic in the mozilla channel I linked
[13:48:59] <Caspy7[m]> but yeah, it sounds very wrong to me
[13:51:45] <Mo> I also found Toolbar density "Compact", also useful, but in general I need to customizing... 
[13:52:04] <Mo> Themes, do they also affect the tab sizing?

[14:19:25] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: Something else, I have set those 2 settings: https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts/tree/master/extensions/bootstrapLoader   That worked.
[14:19:33] <Mo> xpinstall.signatures.required = false  extensions.experiments.enabled = true
[14:20:07] <Mo> But now after some restarts I see a red error on that addon "bootstrap loader could not be verified for use in Firefox and has been disabled."
[14:23:17] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: iirc xpinstall.signatures.required is not honored on Release versions of Firefox. I think it applies to Nightly, Dev (I forget if Beta too) and unbranded builds. If you're building yourself, there may be a flag for it
[14:23:59] <Caspy7[m]> by "it applies" I mean that *those* branches I mentioned *do* honor flipping that pref

[14:51:55] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: I see, what I did is upgraded from 91.7.0 to 98.0, both locally built by Gentoo.
[14:52:31] <Caspy7[m]> well, guess those get the typical release defaults and disallow unsigned addons
[14:53:45] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: Really? I would rather expect the ESR to force signatures, and the nightly not, but it's the opposite.
[14:54:00] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: From the compiler flags I don't see anything regarding signatures.
[14:54:21] <Caspy7[m]> perhaps you misunderstand me, ESR and Release both require signed addon
[14:54:38] <Caspy7[m]> most others do not (if you toggle the pref)

[15:13:50] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: as I said, even though it's not mentioned in your link, basically the only reason that "unbranded" builds exist is to allow unsigned addons to work on release. If you're building yourself then there's probably a way to make it work this way just like unbranded builds
[15:14:18] <susi> Mo: can you screenshot how your tabs look now?
[15:14:50] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing#Unbranded_Builds
[15:16:30] <Caspy7[m]> it's probably possible to find out the build config without running it, but the binary is available, so you could run that and check out about:buildconfig

[16:33:58] <Masklin__Gurder> I'm trying to get a hold of the direct download link of a folder shared on a filehosting site (filecloud), so I can use wget.
[16:34:02] <Masklin__Gurder> How do I do that with firefox?
[16:34:05] <Masklin__Gurder> Is it possible?
[16:46:12] <Caspy7[m]> Masklin__Gurder: it probably depends on the site. I think at least one site will stream files directly to the browser using Webrtc. I wouldn't be surprised if most don't allow such a direct download, but it's not my area of expertise.
[16:48:04] <Cork> websocket not rreturn { code: response.code.to_i, json: JSON.parse(response.body, { symbolize_names: true }) }
[16:48:08] <Cork> opps
[16:48:39] <Cork> Caspy7[m]: rtc is for browser to browser not server to browser though, sure you didn't mean websocket?
[16:49:10] <comets> anyone esle that chose to stay at FF56?

[16:50:58] <Caspy7[m]> Cork: it's possible I'm misremembering the tech. I'm referring to whatever Mega does - though I haven't used it in ages. IIRC it streamed files to the browser page and only once the download was done you'd get a prompt to save it
[16:51:17] <Cork> ya, mega uses websocket
[16:51:51] <Cork> they are close just slightly different usages
[16:52:22] <susi> Masklin__Gurder: don't know about filecloud, but you can't get it from right-click context menu and 'copy link'?
[16:52:45] <Caspy7[m]> well, my underlying message remains the same
[16:52:49] <Masklin__Gurder> susi: No, that only works on naked urls, filecloud and dropbox etc use a GUI
[16:52:54] <Cork> only if the website actaully provide a link for it, many modern file sharing sites doesn't
[16:53:13] <susi> stupid service if they dont provide such a link 
[16:53:19] <Masklin__Gurder> I agree
[16:54:18] <Cork> as such a link would allow direct access to the file, it isn't in there interest
[16:55:06] <Caspy7[m]> right, this effect is generally if not always intentional
[16:55:23] <susi> is that intentionally setcap cap_net_raw=ep and not setcap cap_net_raw+ep?

[23:15:16] <xMopx> something in AWS's console is taking keyboard focus away from the command-F text search box
[23:15:27] <xMopx> that strikes me a something javascript on a web page should not be able to do
[23:15:46] <xMopx> besides this specific site being pretty broken in firefox for the last couple of weeks anyway
[23:25:11] <t4nk_freenode> susi, ... that reminds me.. this 'search for text when you start typing' thing is buggin me now, for I think it grabs focus from videos so I can't f to fullscreen

[23:29:11] <t4nk_freenode> and I hit so many keys accidentally, they all get picked up and I find myself in that little search box all the time.. which I need to escape
[23:29:27] <susi> how come you accidentally hit your keyboard?
[23:29:34] <susi> never happens to me
[23:29:40] <t4nk_freenode> because there's something wrong with me ;)

[23:35:47] <Caspy7[m]> t4nk_freenode: if 'search for text when you start typing' bugs you why would you have it enabled?
[23:36:48] <t4nk_freenode> I changed it the other day, when I thought I'd accidentally bookmarked a lot of sites (by hitting ctrl-d instead of ctrl-f)
[23:37:53] <t4nk_freenode> I remember I had it on, long ago, then switched it off... so then I switched it back on.. and now I realize it's better left off ;)
