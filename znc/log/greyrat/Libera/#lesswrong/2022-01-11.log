[01:09:26] <pompolic> how do i age of consent a paternalistic measure without being that guy
[01:09:31] <pompolic> because it is
[01:09:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you what
[01:09:52] <pompolic> how do i call*
[01:09:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh. You can't
[01:10:08] <pompolic> alas
[01:10:22] <two2thehead> hm, interesting question
[01:11:18] <pompolic> i think part of that correlation is like...political/moral allergies to anything that looks like paternalism
[01:11:26] <gwern> being in favor of lowering age of consent is admirably principled. in the contemporary west, it is moral and just for a teenager to sign up to have their legs blown off in afghanistan to help safeguard afghan feminism, or take on half a million dollars of irrevocable college debt, but the idea of them drinking beer or having sex with anyone is borderline *pedophilia*
[01:12:06] <gwern> if you claim to be a libertarian and you think raising age of consent laws is great, that says a lot about your consistency and willingness to go along with the ever escalating infantilization of everyone under age 30
[01:12:13] <pompolic> pretty much where i'm coming from here: if i were to ask my 15 year old self about drinking age limits, he'd go on a long-ass rant about denial of his agency
[01:13:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: er, wait, are there people who are in favor of *raising* age of consent laws?!
[01:13:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> what the fuck
[01:13:23] <gwern> oh yeah people are always arguing for that quietly
[01:13:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> D:
[01:13:29] <gwern> I think I saw some today actually
[01:13:36] <gwern> something about 'we need to outlaw child marriage in america'
[01:13:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> ??????
[01:14:04] <gwern> inorite. I didn't click because I am better off not knowing
[01:14:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not entirely clear to me that we need age of consent laws at all, really
[01:14:22] <pompolic> i mean
[01:14:31] <pompolic> have you looked at the average person
[01:14:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> As little as I can manage...
[01:14:46] <ggreer> probably amish & FLDS
[01:15:12] <Betawolf> "Did you rape this child?" "No, she asked for sex." "She's 4." is a pretty clear-cut age of consent issue.
[01:15:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> The reality is that a child is much more likely to end up having sex before they're ready due to their parents/family either being evil or crazy or indifferent somehow
[01:15:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... than due to, like, the law insufficiently protecting them from strangers who want to fuck them
[01:15:39] <pompolic> (this would be the core of my 15-year-old-self's apologia: "it might be the right policy for most people most of the time, but i am clearly an outlier in intelligence so it should not apply to me")
[01:15:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... *much* more likely
[01:15:51] <pompolic> (again, wrt. underage drinking)
[01:15:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's exactly what age of consent laws do almost nothing to stop
[01:16:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whereas if instead we had a more robust mechanism for allowing people to be considered legal adults earlier
[01:16:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> That would actually cut down on *more* such violations
[01:16:31] <pompolic> ^
[01:16:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yes, it totally is paternalism, and *extremely ineffective* paternalism, at that
[01:16:56] <pompolic> making emancipation easier / getting better opt-outs would be what i would actually argue for
[01:17:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yes you can't say any of this in polite company
[01:17:23] <Betawolf> I agree with lowering age of consent/legal adult thresholds, or even 'testing out', but the concept is still useful.
[01:17:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Au contraire, that example is actually a perfect demonstration of my point
[01:18:06] <gwern> age of consent laws, but they're dropped to zero within the borders of your local love hotel
[01:18:10] <pompolic> it also occurs to me that child IQ testing started from trying to estimate mental development. or am i wrong?
[01:18:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: The logic properly goes not "she's 4" -> "she can't consent to sex", but "she's 4" -> "she's not and can't be a legal adult" -> "her parents decide everything for her" -> "she can't consent to anything"
[01:18:50] <Betawolf> I don't see how. Your alternative is that the offender is tried for what exactly? 'Being evil' is sort of hard to frame.
[01:19:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> THe offender is of course tried for rape, but not because "there's a law that says don't have sex with people under X"
[01:19:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: I believe you're right
[01:21:01] <pompolic> that makes the original post funny to me in a way i can't really explain
[01:22:42] <rmmh> gwern: what's the age of consent in an embassy? 
[01:22:54] <rmmh> French embassies begin a lucrative side hustle as love hotels 
[01:23:09] <gwern> rmmh: I'd assume it's whatever the foreign country is because embassies are considered foreign soil, no?
[01:23:50] <rmmh> pompolic: IQ and "EQ" (such as it is, heh) progress at notably different rates-- note plenty of child prodigies with childish emotions 
[01:24:13] <two2thehead> rmmh, that is... surprisingly an 'innovative' idea
[01:24:17] <rmmh> a lot of that may be simply hormonal, I suppose. Don't need to develop seduction skills if you're not interested in sex *taps forehead*
[01:25:26] <rmmh> It's one of the biggest downsides of skipping grades 
[01:26:04] <pompolic> rmmh: seems true, t. actual manchild
[01:27:31] <pompolic> but even so, with autism you have, as far as i understand, an even more lopsided development of various qualities
[01:27:57] <pompolic> i don't know what this implies about the situation but still feels relevant somehow
[01:28:30] <pompolic> perhaps something like: collapsing multiple axes into an "age" line
[01:29:21] <Betawolf> an adult qualification test would solve several issues at once
[01:29:53] <Betawolf> the issue would always be who gets to write the test
[01:30:20] <saturn2> "write"?
[01:30:32] <Betawolf> design?
[01:30:45] <saturn2> the test should obviously be putting your hand in a fire ant nest
[01:31:08] <Betawolf> brings home the meaning of 'suffrage'
[01:31:18] <pompolic> do you pass the test by saying "no i won't"
[01:31:53] <saturn2> no, that means you're trans i think

[01:33:38] <rmmh> I agree, autistic age of consent should be raised to 30

Gajewska and Orli≈Ñski both believe that Lem must have had to wear a six-pointed star: he told his wife, Barbara, about being struck for failing to take off his cap in the presence of a German, something only people
[04:39:50] <feepbot> identified as Jews were required to do. Privately, Lem told people that he had witnessed the executions described by his fictional character. ‚ÄúDr. Rappaport‚Äôs adventure is my adventure, from Lw√≥w 1941, after the German army entered‚ÄîI was to be shot,‚Äù he wrote to his American translator Michael Kandel.

[07:16:03] <saturn2> well, same difference
[07:16:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright let's see
[07:16:19] <pie_> Im writing some python code to replicate what this program does (I need to add some headers to a request). The headers are derived from a key, which is derived from a configuration file and from some signing information in the released binary
[07:16:28] <pie_> at least on windows
[07:16:39] <pie_> I need to figure out what the equivalent is on mac and get the value
[07:17:07] <pie_> thats the ConfigurationKey portion of this woindows code: `algorithm.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(appConfig.CodeSignatureHash + appConfig.ProgramBuildVersion + settings.Browser.ConfigurationKey));`
[07:17:10] <pie_> That hash is sent in a header.
[07:17:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well `preferences` seems to be a reference to the standard user defaults object
[07:17:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "org_safeexambrowser_configKey" is just a key into the user defaults

'250' doesn't appear in our CSS that I know of. and what's an 'element.style' anyway that's overriding it? google tells me it's set by JS somewhere... after looking at all the JS messing with styles/width my guess is it's extracts.js, which says '// Ensure no reflow due to figures....

I guess, but then it's imbalanced with the caption wrapper. if I set .caption-wrapper to width:250px instead of width:100%, then it matches up...
[19:13:49] <gwern> ...that way too... the JS snippet loops over images, so it doesn't 'have access' to the caption directly, not sure how to fix that. I suppose it could be hardwired for the caption, like '.wikipedia-entry .caption-wrapper { max-width: 250px; }'?

[20:29:54] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, re that saliva thing - it should not matter that much for americans, given it is likely you guys will retain option to get new booster doses by saying it is your first dose
[20:30:21] <kuudes> over here where I fear they indeed will ban us new doses after third, the self saliva would seem to me like a viable way to boost oneself
[20:30:42] <kuudes> ie after you have recovered from omicron, reinfecti yourself by putting your frozen saliva where there is live virus, into your nose
[20:30:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh I see
[20:30:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's weird
[20:30:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does it actually work?
[20:30:57] <kuudes> yes

[20:31:14] <PapuaHardyNet> snorting your own saliva, sounds like it will work
[20:31:15] <kuudes> at least there should be few medical counterarguments
[20:31:26] <kuudes> it is icky of course
[20:31:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where did you get this idea
[20:31:30] <kuudes> but it is your own saliva
[20:31:33] <kuudes> from my head, thinking hard
[20:31:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did you, like, check it with any doctors or anything
[20:31:55] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, I don't mind snorting my own saliva. the real question is why would you re-infect yourself, live virus is more dangerous than dead
[20:32:05] <kuudes> I have mentioned it to 2 doctors and they have not said anything against it
[20:32:17] <kuudes> one of them adviced not to inject it but indeed to snort it
[20:32:27] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, yes
[20:32:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[20:32:44] <kuudes> but over here it seems possible we will continue to restrict availability of doses

[20:33:23] <kuudes> not send
[20:33:28] <kuudes> we just have 1.2M unused doses
[20:33:46] <PapuaHardyNet> just lying there unused? not sold, not donated, just lying somewhere?
[20:33:50] <Betawolf> because someone likes how they smell as they go off
[20:33:52] <kuudes> stored
[20:34:16] <kuudes> the health minister will prevent giving them away, the health institute will prevent giving them to people...
[20:34:31] <PapuaHardyNet> what's the official reason for this?
[20:34:34] <kuudes> but at least the health minister finally got the health institute to allow boosters just before christmas
[20:34:45] <kuudes> "they are not needed"
[20:34:56] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[20:35:13] <kuudes> then there have been varying excuses, which are unrelated
[20:35:21] <kuudes> such as that they cost much - but they have already been paid for
[20:36:01] <kuudes> but it seems they are not alone https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/end-mass-jabs-and-live-with-covid-says-ex-head-of-vaccine-taskforce

[20:36:28] <kuudes> there appears to be some sort of movement in north europe, possibly related to great barrington declaration
[20:37:16] <kuudes> indeed when a journalist asked of the health institute person when will the vaccines become regular medicines sold in pharmacies, she answered that if there are overflow, they will be donated to other countries
[20:37:26] <kuudes> but health institute does not have authority to donate them.
[20:38:00] <kuudes> health ministry loaned some 150k doses to estonia before christmas so that they will give new doses to us in february
[20:38:03] <PapuaHardyNet> I now get your distress regarding the health institute in finland
[20:39:01] <kuudes> usa has had a little similar; presidential admin wanted to allow people to get boosters, cdc/fda disallowed them in september -> risk groups were redefined to include about everyone
[20:39:59] <kuudes> the most recent thing is that health institute managed to overthrow health ministry push for moving schools remote since new year
[20:40:46] <kuudes> now the same doctors are saying in same tv spot first that the situation is cataclysmic and there are not enough capacity to treat everyone coming in with covid and that remote education must not be used because it harms children
[20:41:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume you aren't sending your kids to school then, hopefully
[20:41:12] <kuudes> I am not
[20:41:22] <kuudes> but I have to take my 6 year old for a minute to daycare
[20:41:35] <kuudes> because she has soon been 60 days out of daycare, and the city would otherwise cancel her spot
[20:41:36] <PapuaHardyNet> lots of fallout for the citizens due to this... politicking? it doesn't even make sense to me
[20:41:52] <PapuaHardyNet> a minute hahah
[20:42:04] <kuudes> so we agreed with the private daycare chief that she will come at just when the daycare opens 6.30 at morning there and immediately will be recalled home
[20:42:41] <kuudes> this way the daycare can wash their hands and they are not frauding the city for the daycare subsidy of our kid, but we don't have to communicate with the city
[20:42:53] <capisce> kuudes: thanks, I just got my booster dose this saturday
[20:42:54] <kuudes> because it seems very possible the city would order the child to the daycare
[20:42:59] <kuudes> congrats capisce!
[20:43:27] <kuudes> I tried to get my kids vaccinated already in november with a doctor's prescription for covid vaccine
[20:43:45] <kuudes> but the official infection doctor gave official decision that that was to be banned
[20:44:15] <kuudes> by that time already 5M american kids were vaccinated without dying to heart conditions
[20:44:34] <kuudes> oh, and did I say that we already back then had 1.3M extra doses?
[20:44:58] <kuudes> and no permission for boosters for anyone under 60 who was not in strict at-risk groups
[20:45:47] <kuudes> also, they tried to deny me my booster in december when I went to get it as agreed, because I had got the additional dose of immune patients already in september, which is in the sale permit of the vaccine
[20:46:16] <kuudes> it is a bit tiring to have to fight this much in order to get a medicine we have so much in storages that we can't fit more

[23:07:59] <two2thehead> Granted, there are apparently ways of compensating for this
[23:08:19] <two2thehead> But I suspect that this is a fundamental limit of crypto. oh well

[23:11:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's some A+++ rationality
[23:11:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[23:12:24] <gwern> remember, even rich people love a deal!
[23:12:25] <two2thehead> damn rich people hiding updates to our foreheads!
[23:12:55] <ggreer> yeah what the hell? apple makes it ridiculously easy to do automated backups
[23:12:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> They love a deal but they don't like to, like, think for five seconds about ... hell, what am I saying, Mac OS tells you to set up Time Machine when you install it!
[23:13:10] <ggreer> and a wallet file is super small. I have my wallets backed up on multiple encrypted drives
[23:13:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also a good point
[23:14:17] <two2thehead> ggreer, is that analogous to having your password file backed up on the cloud? I don't do crypto so I'm trying to find an analogy here
[23:14:42] <ggreer> with a mac you just plug in an external hard drive and you can set up automated backups
[23:14:51] <rmmh> When SSB discovered that semen made a good invisible ink, his agents adopted the motto "Every man his own stylo". However, the use of semen as invisible ink was ceased because of the smell it produced for the eventual receiver. It also raised questions over the masturbatory habits of the agents
[23:14:54] <ggreer> it's not to the cloud, just to the drive (and it can be encrypted)
[23:15:09] <two2thehead> okay, good enough
[23:15:11] <two2thehead> ggreer, +1
[23:15:52] <ggreer> if you had an airport with a USB port or a time capsule, you can set up automatic wireless backups (again encrypted if you like). that backs it up to the drive in the time capsule or the drive attached to the airport
[23:16:13] <ggreer> IIRC, a new mac will bug you to set up backups
[23:16:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I run a Time Machine server from one of my hackintoshes. Back up everything over the network, works great
[23:17:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Got a RAID5 in there
[23:18:32] <ggreer> I only have one mac left and it's pretty close to dying. its main use right now is to backup my phone and sync photos to/from it
[23:18:54] <ggreer> or if my mom sends me a multi-paragraph imessage and I have to respond with similar amounts of text
[23:23:07] <ggreer> I guess I should take the time to copy all my photos to my linux laptop. syncing photos *to* the phone would be tricky though
[23:23:37] * two2thehead puts on the kettle and looks out the window
[23:23:47] <two2thehead> ah, phone syncing on linux
[23:24:03] <two2thehead> now that's something I haven't heard about in years
[23:24:49] <two2thehead> (yes yes synching to a server which connects to the phone is a thing, but that's not direct linux to phone syncing)
