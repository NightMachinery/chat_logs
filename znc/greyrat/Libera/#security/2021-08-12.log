[00:44:46] <krishna> Is there some rough guideline on how often things like cookie/session secrets should be rotated? Should they be changed at some regular interval? Should they only be changed if we suspect there was a chance they were leaked somehow?

[00:56:09] <TimMc> Great question, and basically no one will agree on an answer. :-P
[00:56:47] <TimMc> I will say that regular (and even automated!) rotation will help ensure that when one does leak, you *know* you'll be able to rotate it quickly and with little fuss.
[00:57:27] <TimMc> By cookie/session secrets you mean server secrets that are used for signing cookies?

[00:58:48] <TimMc> The other thing, and this is probably even more important, is to always accept a *list* of secrets (or at least two) -- use the first one for signing, and accept any of them for verification. This is essential for a clean rotation process.
[00:58:55] *** Quits: chipox (~chipox@31.170.22.17) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:17:53] <skill> it also depends on use case
[01:18:18] <skill> but for web session cookies, the overall best practice is to revoke them after X minutes of idle time or forced revocation after X hours of session lenght.
[01:18:21] <skill> length*
[01:19:37] <krishna> TimMc: Yeah. I meant the server secrets used to sign cookies.
[01:19:40] <krishna> Good point on building the muscle to make it easy to rotate in the event of a leak. That seems like justification enough to set up a regular practice or automation!
[01:20:11] <skill> ah, yup. that's a good advice. Build the rotation mechanisms from the get-go.
[01:28:45] <TimMc> My advice is to have a comment, document, or runbook for every secret saying what the impact is if compromised, how to rotate it, and what side effects to expect on rotation. Can just be a few lines.
[01:29:13] <TimMc> The poor schmuck who has to rotate the secret at 3 AM is going to be grateful.
[01:30:11] <TimMc> Paradoxically, you may not want to use the same secret for multiple purposes, as that makes rotation more complicated -- but also you may not want too many secrets, for the same reason!

[18:39:02] <tetrapod> Hey i'm looking at what others do for 2fa / verification codes. A lot of web resources talk about digits. Would there be any reason to use digits instead of alphanumeric?

[18:42:46] <[iz]> yall see this yet?  https://github.com/hackingintoyourheart/unoriginal-rice-patty
[18:44:04] <[iz]> tetrapod: with rolling time based codes, 4 digits is usually enough and less confusing than 3 alphanumeric characters
[18:44:35] <tetrapod> Huh, you think so?
[18:45:07] <[iz]> tetrapod: yeah, like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password
[18:45:25] <tetrapod> Yea, but why would digits be easier?
[18:46:06] <[iz]> what's easier to enter in?  3425 or 7O0?
[18:46:35] <[iz]> less symbol confusion for no increase in security
[18:46:55] <[iz]> er.. i mean more confusion w/ alphanumeric
[18:47:06] <[iz]> esp because you can't pick the codes, they are generated for you
[18:47:24] <tetrapod> Ah, the 0o makes sense.. Didn't think of that.
[18:47:36] <skill> i believe, cognitive wise, people remember digits faster than alphanumeric/letters.
[18:48:38] <tetrapod> I personally have always had difficulty remembering where I am in an all digit code. But that might be me.
[18:48:40] <[iz]> yeah, easier when you know there are only 10 possible for each position
[18:48:50] <[iz]> well, how long is the code?
[18:49:07] <[iz]> 4 is about where the brain tops out.. and 7 for memory
[18:49:18] <[iz]> that's why phone numbers get seperated like XXX-XXXX
[18:51:00] <tetrapod> totp so 6 digits. But esp with repeating sequences like 565683 I get confused easily and I got to look like 5 times to see if i did it correctly.
