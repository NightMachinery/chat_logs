[05:08:21] <hyiltiz> no i am whining why ess is not included in GNU Emacs to support GNU R out of the box
[05:08:36] <jeetelongname> I can't speak for ess but it seems specialised into doing a lot more than supporting R syntactically

[05:09:00] <hyiltiz> GNU Octave is just as specialized and that is included
[05:09:01] <Common-Lisp> hyiltiz, why would it be included out of the box?
[05:09:12] <hyiltiz> Octave is even more specialized than R, most lilely
[05:09:28] <jeetelongname> I mean the package not the language
[05:09:36] <hyiltiz> People write R, so including it out of the box gives ppl less incentive
[05:09:40] <hyiltiz> ofc the package not the lang
[05:10:00] <hyiltiz> now I need to take a few steps bfr emacs becomes a useful tool for editing GNU R programs
[05:10:01] <shrysr> well if you feel that strongly about it maybe take the time to post to the mailing list or search through it to begin with. Fwiw there's a separate mailing list for ESS.. i.e i dont think it is explicitly connected or focused on being 'a part of Emacs'. Also afaik - ESS development is quite ... slow and esp compared to RStudio the user base is quite small.I really like ESS.
[05:10:04] <Common-Lisp> Emacs includes GNU Octave out of the box?
[05:10:25] <Common-Lisp> That's gnus to me.
[05:10:31] <hyiltiz> vanilla emacs is useful for GNU Octave, and even supports Non-GNU JS and Python and not even lang ANTLR
[05:10:58] <hyiltiz> Who should I bug around to see if ESS can be included in Vanilla emacs?
[05:11:18] <Common-Lisp> Emacs's built-in javascript support is abysmal and should likely be removed
[05:11:22] <Common-Lisp> that's why js2-mode exists
[05:11:33] <jeetelongname> go talk to the ess project to see if they want to include there project in core, and if they agree then go talk to the mailing list
[05:11:46] <hyiltiz> slow ESS dev is not bad tho; it could mean feature complete and mature and stable
[05:12:34] <hyiltiz> hmm i c; so if ESS devs are willing (to contribute) and emacs core dev is willing (to accept), it can happen?
[05:12:54] <technomancy> ,zombo
[05:12:55] <fsbot> Welcome to Emacs! Anything is possible in Emacs. Anything at all! Welcome to Emacs! Welcome! In Emacs, the only limit is you. The unattainable is unknown in Emacs. Welcome to Emacs! Anything at all is possible in Emacs! Welcome! Welcome!
[05:12:57] <Common-Lisp> essentially, yes, but those are two very large "if"s
[05:13:26] <hyiltiz> what are usual road blocks for these tings? Emacs core devs want certain elisp fu and ESS want certain kong and their kong fu dont match and they dont wanna fight over it?
[05:13:28] <technomancy> the ESS devs have to be OK with refusing to accept contributions from non-paperwork-signers
[05:13:30] <bremner> hyiltiz: contributing to emacs is kindof a pain, unfortunately
[05:13:42] <jeetelongname> "support" is also relative. for me I want more than syntax highlighting, things like linting, code completion and diagnostics. to emacs-devel it might only be a major mode and a flymake... maker? this is a simplification but i hope it convays what I mean
[05:13:51] <Common-Lisp> yeah, usually package maints don't actually want their stuff in Emacs core due to copyright assignment.
[05:13:54] <bremner> hyiltiz: copyright assignment and disclaimer paperwork is a blocker
[05:13:55] <Common-Lisp> and more rapid development
[05:14:20] <Common-Lisp> It's common to see devs of stuff in Emacs core actively try to move it out: see org-mode.
[05:14:29] <hyiltiz> but ESS is GNU GPL so they are probably fine with the assignment? after all, it lets FSF protect them a bit more

[05:15:56] <Common-Lisp> and not much benefit to the latter

[05:17:18] <hyiltiz> I just wish most "useful/convenient" features come out of the box so I can tell my chemist friend to use emacs to write his dissertation in latex AND run his simulations in python and do his plots in R all through emacs, without too much extra set up

[05:18:15] <jeetelongname> I already use an external version of org and use a fraction of emacs packages, all they do is kinda cause pain for me when native compiling emacs.

[05:18:37] <hyiltiz> I realized most of the time I do NOT use those packages and they just bloat my dev knife
[05:18:41] <shrysr> hyiltiz: there are atleast a few on the ESS mailing list who do tend to reply to posts and might give you... better answers. A google search would show you 'who to bug'  > https://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#Mailing-Lists
[05:18:52] <Common-Lisp> yes, distros suck. but if your goal is to have stuff out of the box, that's your option.
[05:19:05] <jeetelongname> putting them on elpa and maybe bundling them on install makes emacs lighter and easier to hack on.

[13:35:35] <afidegnum> gracias
[13:35:51] <wasamasa> this kind of things tends to happen if you kill the scratch buffer accidentally
[13:36:11] <afidegnum> yes,
[13:36:41] <afidegnum> this issue is also happening on WSL, I don't know if there is a correlation
[13:37:04] <johnjaye> actually now that i think about it that would be an interesting side effect of a more full featured weechat.el
[13:37:07] <johnjaye> you could just use emacs themes

[13:38:06] <wasamasa> having arbitrary code execution by design in your themes, yay
[13:38:38] <johnjaye> well my use case is terminal related. i have a grey background
[13:38:46] <johnjaye> doesn't fit neatly with either "dark" or "light" themes.
[13:38:51] <johnjaye> so custom themeing for weechat would be great
[13:38:55] <codingquark> soon the color will transfer to your beard
[13:39:11] <johnjaye> would making weechat have its own theme system be better you think?
[13:39:35] <wasamasa> doesn't it have one?
[13:39:38] <wasamasa> I don't use weechat at all
[13:39:38] <jbe> rudybot: a colour theme that switches the colours around every time you press enter
[13:39:51] <johnjaye> i don't think so. it has individual variables you can set for colors i believe

[13:40:32] <rudybot> jbe: Which is to say: Emacs has perfectly good default colours on the tty, just customize the tty's 16 colour palette.
[13:40:37] <wasamasa> so you can do the equivalent of (load "solarized.weechat.ini")
[13:40:49] <s-liao> What is the target of the troop?
[13:41:24] <johnjaye> it looks like you're supposed to download a python script that manually sets the colors to your desired theme

[18:11:55] <Demosthenex> hodapp: tuis rock
[18:12:16] <wasamasa> there is a workaround of using a different keybinding than RET, but that just fixes the most glaring offender

[18:17:37] <bpalmer> (require 'ls-lisp)
[18:17:39] <zacque> wasamasa: Oh, so you prefer working on the file system directly instead of ls output?

[18:17:53] <wasamasa> lol
[18:17:55] <rpav> or at least, you'd want to write a drop-in-compatible replacment for dired so you _could_ use all the existing other-dired stuff, which i think is effectively the same thing
[18:17:58] <ecraven> is there a way to mark buffer-local variables so they are *not* erased when a new major-mode is enabled?

[18:19:09] <ecraven> use case: edit-indirect opens a new buffer, I've found/edited a bit of code that removes indentation from the start, and stores the number of spaces in a local variable. If I now switch that buffer to another major mode, that information is lost.

[23:50:31] <grym> i like having a speedo that has a needle in it that bounces around, it's a lot more satisfying
[23:50:50] <bremner> needles in your bathing suit sounds like  a bad idea
[23:51:09] <shrysr> might be useful against sharks
[23:51:17] <bpalmer> seems a sew-sew idea to me.
[23:51:18] <artefact> the needle is very inaccurate though. at least on my car, compared to gps measurements
[23:51:22] <grym> i think mitsubishi's approach to lidar/camera/AI systems is a fundamentally more achievable one: https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-last-a-self-driving-car-that-can-explain-itself

[23:56:23] <aidalgol> One of my favourites to tell people about is that your phone has more than one OS.

[23:57:49] <artefact> arguably they've become virtual machines
[23:58:06] <artefact> or, maybe more accurate, JIT interpreters
[23:59:02] <artefact> all those side channel attacks, just waiting to be exploited, fascinating and super scary
