[02:16:20] <phogg> Whoever figured out the BUILD/TWEAK constructor split was a genius. The more I try to use more rigid non-Raku languages the more I'm convinced nothing else is sane.

[02:32:11] <Xliff> phogg: Examples, pls? I'm interested in seeing how other people have been using that.
[02:35:34] <phogg> I have nothing particularly worth sharing, just a general delight in the way that composition with them works
[02:36:17] <phogg> for a work project I and one of my co-workers liberally stole the Raku object model and implemented it in PHP, and it is there where we have repeatedly found the objects and APIs to be superior
[02:36:35] <phogg> things I have in real Raku are too trivial by comparison

[03:02:42] <phogg> [Coke]: would if we could
[03:02:53] <[Coke]> I hear that.
[03:02:56] <phogg> a couple million lines of code don't get rewritten overnight
[03:03:13] <[Coke]> What if there was an Inline::PHP?
[03:03:34] <phogg> we had been saying for years "sure would be nice if the APIs and libraries in PHP didn't suck" and then in 2017 my co-maintainer said "I am just going to write a version of Str."

[03:04:09] <phogg> One thing lead to another, and things are much better now. If you box hard enough you can get pretty far even without a language that really supports modifying itself
[03:04:23] <phogg> lack of multiple inheritance is a pretty hard limit
[03:05:23] <phogg> I should eventually port our extensions to Str and other things out and put them up as raku modules. There are some useful things maybe others would want.
[03:06:44] <[Coke]> cool.
[03:09:29] <phogg> if there was a working Inline::PHP that would help a lot.
[03:10:07] <phogg> that would give us an easier incremental transition path without having to stop and rewrite the world.
