[00:14:45] <kwilczynski> Ah oh.
[00:14:53] <kwilczynski> People are actually helping with my Open Source project.
[00:15:06] <kwilczynski> I wish I had money to give them in return or buy them a pony.
[00:16:45] <kwilczynski> Granted, some would like a Tesla, but I firmly believe that a pony is better... or goat.
[00:18:26] *** Joins: [twisti] (~twisti@toadwater.com)
[00:20:02] <[twisti]> im looking for a tool that will let me track 'health' metrics of a heterogenous fleet of machines (windows, linux, maybe some routers and iot stuff if possible) such as uptime/outages, hdd space, update status, things like that. any advice ?
[00:23:51] <kwilczynski> [twisti]: Perhaps Promethous exporter? 
[00:24:30] <kwilczynski> [twisti]: I am not sure if the metrics are uniform across each OS, probably not, however you could then build dashboards that look sensible. And it has decent ish support out-of-the box: https://promcat.io/apps/windows
[00:27:07] <dan_pena> in which folder would you put scripts to build the project?
[00:27:18] <kwilczynski> dan_pena: Which language?
[00:27:57] <dan_pena> kwilczynski: latex
[00:28:08] <kwilczynski> Ohh.
[00:29:25] <dodo> dan_pena: hm, what's a latex "project" exactly?
[00:29:49] <kwilczynski> [twisti]: If you want you could use SNMP as it might work for Windows and Linux, and any IoT based on Linux. There are probably other pojects, and there are handful of commercial solutions. There is Beats suite from from Elastic.
[00:30:29] <dan_pena> dodo: source of tex files to create at the end a documentation pdf
[00:30:35] <kwilczynski> dan_pena: I am not sure what would you need there? Is this like a LaTeX class?
[00:30:46] <dodo> ok.. that's just one document
[00:30:48] <kwilczynski> dan_pena: Perhaps "build" or "scripts" or "dist".
[00:31:03] <dan_pena> kwilczynski: what dist means ?
[00:31:11] <kwilczynski> "distribution"
[00:31:19] <dodo> dan_pena: i use like templates/ and inc/ and things, whatever makes sense for your content
[00:31:30] <kwilczynski> Used in some C/C++ projects.
[00:31:30] <dan_pena> so I can put build script in a build/ folder?
[00:31:44] <kwilczynski> dan_pena: Is your script a Makefile?
[00:31:45] <dan_pena> or is a build/ folder only for the result of the building?
[00:31:47] <dodo> you have a build script?
[00:31:50] <kwilczynski> Bash script?
[00:31:52] <dan_pena> yes
[00:31:56] <dan_pena> .sh
[00:32:06] <kwilczynski> Is it complex?
[00:32:17] <dan_pena> not that much
[00:32:17] <kwilczynski> Turn it into a Makefile, keep it in the root, and should be fine.
[00:32:18] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:32:34] <dodo> yeah, i just use make for all my latex stuff
[00:32:41] <kwilczynski> Same here.
[00:32:57] <dodo> though i have some python scripts to build some tex files from data sources..
[00:33:12] <slaughter> I'd put scripts in a scripts/ folder - dist/ and build/ have pretty persistent meanings across a lot of languages/frameworks 
[00:35:10] <[twisti]> im less interested in collecting metrics as in 'now' information
[00:35:41] <kwilczynski> [twisti]: You want some real-time view?
[00:36:27] <[twisti]> yeah, i dont really care much if a machine was full last month, i just want to know if its full now
[00:37:27] <kwilczynski> [twisti]: No worries. Mind you - you can alert on metrics. :) But I get it.
[00:38:12] <kwilczynski> [twisti]: You might laugh, but if you need a very active and perhaps pull based monitoring, then you even have good old Nagios.
[00:38:29] <kwilczynski> And probably a bazillion other projects alike.
[00:38:46] <[twisti]> ill read up on it
[00:39:19] <kwilczynski> Nagios is old, though.
[00:39:31] <kwilczynski> Sensu is now a paid product.
[00:39:33] <kwilczynski> Hmm.
[00:41:54] <kwilczynski> [twisti]: Zabbix, Icinga, Shinken, etc...
[01:04:31] <dan_pena> I want to create a folder for external documentation (pdf and so on ...) that are not built by me
[01:04:41] <dan_pena> Any idea on a name for this one?
[01:07:45] <slaughter> docs/external/
[01:08:14] <slaughter> Though probably better suited as links in the case of PDFs etc
[01:16:40] <kwilczynski> It can simply be "external/".
[01:17:01] <kwilczynski> Could be "extras/".
[01:17:30] <kwilczynski> Some people add a popular one: contrib/
[01:17:58] <kwilczynski> To be honest. Put it where you see fit. :) It's your project!

[22:29:40] <lantech19446> I had the weirdest problem yesterday, all of a sudden 3 computers wouldn't backup and all of them were saying the domain was unavailable but I could verify the domain controller was working and the other 9 computers all had no issue so I was having a really tough time figuring it out. Here it turns out the domain controller time had somehow gotten messed up and was 3:40 ahead of TrueNAS so we lost
