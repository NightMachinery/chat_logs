[11:51:36] <cousteau> What are the restrictions on branches that are checked out in worktrees?
[11:53:14] <cousteau> For example, I know that I can't check out the current active branch into a new worktree, so I guess that in general two worktrees (including the main one) can't have the same branch checked out, which would make sense
[11:55:29] <cousteau> (otherwise, committing to one branch from one worktree would need to either modify the other worktree, remove its branch and leave it in detached head mode, or leave it in a "dirty" state)
[11:56:13] <osse> that's the only restriction I know of
[11:56:21] <cousteau> I guess that, in general, operations involving modifying a branch that is already active in a worktree are forbidden?
[11:56:27] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@bcdcb6e3.skybroadband.com)

[12:01:21] <cousteau> I was thinking that it would be nice for git merge to allow doing a "reverse merge" (merge our branch into theirs, i.e., don't touch our branch and advance their branch to the merge commit) or a "dual merge" (merge and advance both branches to the merge commit).  But that might interfere with worktrees
[12:03:16] <osse> if it's a fastforward you can abuse push for that purpose
[12:03:35] <cousteau> I guess git branch -f also has restrictions?
[12:05:01] <cousteau> osse: how would that work?  Push the current branch into the other branch in the local repo instead of a remote?
[12:05:15] <osse> yes
[12:05:18] <osse> git push . foo:bar

[12:06:27] <cousteau> Oh, .
[12:08:04] <cousteau> I wonder if I can use git pull in a similar fashion
[12:08:22] <cousteau> Or... that only works on the current branch, right?
[12:08:38] <osse> s'
[12:08:40] <osse> yes
[12:08:46] <osse> since pull = fetch + merge
[12:09:33] <cousteau> I guess that merging files implies that the files have to exist in disk, so you need to check out the branch first

[12:17:55] <cousteau> So the only reasonable way to "merge into" would be if at the end you force changing to the branch receiving the merge.  Otherwise it's just a normal merge with extra steps
[12:20:24] <cousteau> I guess `git merge --switch|--into $theirs` would be equivalent to `git checkout --detach && git merge $theirs && git checkout -B $theirs`
[12:21:08] <cousteau> which has the sole advantage of only touching the files it actually needs to touch

[15:20:20] <tim67> Hi all! Could I have some advice on my github project architecture?
[15:20:25] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[15:20:25] <tim67> I'm creating MyProject which uses a lot of files from AnotherProject, so I want to keep AnotherProject in a folder in my repo. So far so good, I'll just use a submodule. However, I need to make a couple lines of changes to AnotherProject. I still want to be able to easily merge upstream changes to AnotherProject into the folder in MyProject.
[15:20:30] <tim67> I'm somewhat new to git and my initial idea feels unnecessarily convoluted: Fork AnotherProject to tim67/AnotherProject and create a branch for my changes. Have a submodule in MyProject pointing to that tim67/AnotherProject branch. When AnotherProject is updated, pull and merge upstream in tim67/AnotherProject and then update the submodule pointer.
[15:20:33] <tim67> Is this a good solution, is there some issue I'm missing, anyone got a better idea?

[15:22:14] <BtbN> submodules generally point to commits, not branches
[15:22:31] <BtbN> so you need to update the commit is points to and then commit that change to your main repo
[15:22:58] <BtbN> You CAN point it to a branch iirc, but it's bad practice since it can make one commit hash refer to different trees of code
[15:23:54] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[15:24:08] <osse> I'd go a long way to avoid having to make change to the submodule. E.g. apply a patch as part of a build/deploy/whatever process.
[15:24:23] <tim67> Right BtbN, sorry about the terminology, with "submodule pointing to branch" I meant pointing to the latest commit on that branch and that I'd update it to point to the new latest commit when I merged upstream
[15:24:40] <osse> It is impossible to make a submodule point to a branch. You can set some config to make it easier to update, but the tree in the superproject will always have the hash of a particular commit
[15:24:52] <BtbN> Why make a fork of it at all?
[15:25:06] <BtbN> The submodule already points to a fixed commit
[15:25:11] <tim67> Thanks osse, I've just checked medium ways so far
[15:25:26] <osse> BtbN: because they need to code changes there
[15:26:00] <BtbN> Also, I'm pretty sure submodules _can_ track branches. But it's a bad idea.

[15:26:26] <tim67> Sorry about bringing in the confusion of submodules tracking branches, I've never really used submodules and got the words wrong
[15:27:28] <osse> They can track, sure, but the commit you get when you initialize the submodules will never be "dynamic", for lack of a better term
[15:28:31] <tim67> AnotherProject is basically a big static webpage that MyProject is automating. I guess I could make a "build step" that copies it all from the submodule to another folder and then applies a patch file before running the browser automation stuff

[16:14:45] <cousteau> Swahili: I always get `git stash` wrong when added-but-not-committed files are involved.  If this is your case maybe I could interest you in using worktrees instead..
[16:15:12] <cousteau> Why do you want to add that directory though?  Is it a new directory not yet tracked by git?
[16:15:50] <Swahili> cousteau: tks for checking! yeh, that's the case! I do have worktrees in my mind but haven't picked that yet
[16:16:14] *** Quits: crabbedhaloablut (~crabbedha@user/crabbedhaloablut) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:16:20] <cousteau> Because if so, you don't need to stash anything.  Just don't add those files until they're ready.
[16:16:22] <mackerman> Swahili: Always more than one way to do it.  Another option. replace  stash with  commit everything, and  eventually commit a delete of anything unnecessary.
[16:16:29] *** Joins: crabbedhaloablut (~crabbedha@user/crabbedhaloablut)
[16:16:50] <cousteau> If you've never added those files to git, then committing, switching branches, etc won't touch those files
[16:17:02] <Swahili> cousteau: starting a new project that is based in another. created a monorepo, and copying the other project to the new location as a package, clearing things up to keep it as minimal as possible. I want to commit only at a point where I can consider it "a boilerplate" and start history from there.
[16:17:19] <Swahili> mackerman: yeah understand what you mean
[16:17:20] *** Joins: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog)
[16:17:56] <cousteau> Only case in which you might accidentally commit those files is if you do `git add .` or `git commit -a` (well, not sure about the latter actually)
[16:18:11] <Swahili> cousteau: yeah that's true, but since I'm deleting stuff and moving things around, I might make some mistakes and its always nice to go back, of course can always check source, but considering the small incremental changes as I go, rather stash
[16:18:37] <Swahili> cousteau: I think I'll go with the worktrees, will find some time during this weekend to start learning it, I find that great
[16:18:45] <mackerman> Step zero is always !backup
[16:18:45] <gitinfo> Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup. See also http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitBestPractices/#backups
[16:20:03] <Swahili> mackerman: yeh that's true. the url seems to be down atm
[16:20:32] <cousteau> Swahili: worktrees were almost disappointingly easy when I finally decided to learn about them.  It's pretty much like having a clone of your repo on a different folder, so that you have two copies of the repo
[16:21:01] <Swahili> cousteau: oh! your hinting to get started as its easy to jump onto
[16:21:14] <cousteau> (btw another option is to clone your repo and do the changes there and then push to the original)

[16:22:39] <cousteau> Yeah.  You simply have to `git worktree add` with the right options, and it'll create a "clone" of your repo in the folder you specified.  cd to that folder and work normally, as if it were a normal git repo
[16:23:42] <cousteau> Basically there's no distinction between being in a normal repo or a worktree once you have created it.  The worktree works as a normal repo, with the same set of git commands
[16:23:44] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[16:24:24] <cousteau> The only restriction is that you cannot checkout the same branch in multiple worktrees (or in the main project directory and a worktree)
[16:24:47] <Swahili> cousteau: oh I see! interesting :) I'll try :) since we can have multiple, I guess I can then cherry-pick and stuff
[16:24:54] <Swahili> cousteau: thanks! that really helps :)
[16:25:02] <cousteau> You're welcome :)
[16:25:10] <mackerman> Project based on another,  do you still need all the files from the original project?
[16:25:50] <Swahili> mackerman: not really, but during meetings when someone else says "Oh can you re-use that other one, bla bla, do you think it'll be quick since we already did almost all"
[16:26:09] <Swahili> by doing that it inherits quite a lot of decisions, that were made and are very specific to the other use-case
[16:26:20] <mackerman> Sounds like you can create smaller projects that could be installed with some external  package manager.
[16:26:27] <Swahili> so I'd rather remove all those decisions and just keep the ones... I think are ok to get started
[16:27:01] <Swahili> mackerman: yeah doing that actually! this is a js project, so start with lerna to manage the monorepo
[16:27:13] <Swahili> has some other dependencies that I'll put it, which I tend to use git submodules for
[16:28:00] *** Quits: christall (~christall@24.235.90.74) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[16:28:22] <cousteau> You could just "fork" the project: clone it, delete all the branches and tags you don't care about (or don't delete them), tag the latest master commit as "this is where my forked project starts", and start adding changes on top of master
[16:28:40] <cousteau> Changes like "deleted a bunch of stuff I no longer needed"
[16:29:52] <cousteau> Basically, fork the project and make the "cleanup" as a bunch of commits.  You can just ignore previous history.
[16:29:57] <Swahili> cousteau: oh yeah that's true, much appreciated! although being a bit picky with history and also to keep privacy about the other project. And finally, since I moved to a "monorepo" architecture... well, just happened to feel that this would be the way to go!
[16:30:27] <cousteau> But of course, if you prefer to just copy the project and restart history "from scratch", that's up to you.
[16:30:52] <cousteau> Oooh yeah if privacy is an issue you'll want to wipe history.
[16:31:46] <Swahili> cousteau: yeah, thanks ;)
[16:31:50] *** Joins: christall (~christall@24.235.90.74)
[16:32:07] <cousteau> Does "monorepo" mean "I converted all submodules into part of the main repository"?  (I've done that before; dealing with .gitignore was a pain)
[16:32:08] <mackerman> I don't get the point of monorepo if the hold projects history  is not desired.
[16:32:16] <mackerman> * old
[16:33:21] <cousteau> Also I found a bug in `git rm --cached $submodule` in the process.

[16:36:18] <cousteau> I had to remove all submodules but without deleting the files, and then add those files.  Since there were a lot of submodules, I tried to be smart and use a script.  It didn't end too well, but I managed to get around it.
[16:37:44] <Swahili> mackerman: I can provide more clarity. This project in particular is more of a "presentation layer". The packages that will be integrated, are related to the business layer, that the previous project is not aware of. It'll use npm packages, that lerna can bootstrap and help link, publish, etc. That facilitates a lot. To summarise, the previous project history in which the "presentation layer" inherits from is
[16:37:44] <Swahili> not completely necessary for this use-case. I do understand other reasons why you'd say that.

[16:50:18] <cousteau> Swahili: anyway, back to my original point.  The problem with git add + stash + stash apply is that git stash does weird things when stuff is partially added to the index.  I think stash push defaults to stashing the index too, but stash apply doesn't restore it by default.
[16:51:13] <cousteau> Also, what the hell was that?  A glitch in the Matrix bridge?

[18:26:20] <dmlloyd> is there some single command which lets you amend a commit that is not the HEAD commit that auto rebases the rest of the commits, and rolls back on error?
[18:26:43] <dmlloyd> my current method is to create a temp commit, interactive rebase, and fixup
[18:26:51] <dmlloyd> but that's kind of a pain
[18:27:33] <dmlloyd> like `git commit --amend HEAD^^^` or something...

[18:42:56] <cousteau> dmlloyd: technically `git rebase -i` is a single command
[18:43:12] <dmlloyd> :-|
[18:43:19] <cousteau> You can add "edit" (I think) to a commit to pause the amend
[18:43:27] <ikke> omega_doom: I didn't refer to specific branches
[18:43:31] <cousteau> Er, to pause the rebase and amend the commit
[18:43:40] <cousteau> Which I think is what you want
[18:43:42] <dmlloyd> that's a similar amount of work to temp commit + fixup afaict
[18:43:48] <ikke> so in this case, the branch you're on deleted it, while the branch you merged, changed it
[18:44:28] <cousteau> dmlloyd: what will this temp commit do?
[18:44:43] <omega_doom> ikke: When i have such conflict and stage such file then rebase --continue spits out "error: your local changes would be overwritten by cherry-pick."

[18:46:15] <dmlloyd> assume conflicts are not an issue, I only do this when I know there won't be any
[18:46:25] <omega_doom> ikke: oh, yes it is rebase so it is the opposite. But now i cannot continue rebase althouh all changes are staged.
[18:46:26] <dmlloyd> but if a conflict were to happen I'd want to get an error
[18:46:29] *** Joins: wladimir (~doforlove@user/doforlove33)
[18:46:45] <cousteau> Not quite the same.  A file can be modified in multiple points without causing a conflict.
[18:46:56] <dmlloyd> then yes, the file may be modified several times
[18:48:08] <cousteau> In this case I was asking because you could interactively rebase, stop after HEAD^^^, git add the modified file, git commit --amend, and continue the rebase
[18:48:45] <dmlloyd> that's actually more work than committing the oops fix right away then git rebase -i to fixup the bad commit
[18:49:05] <cousteau> But in that case, the easiest, safest, and probably only solution is the temp fixup commit
[18:49:08] <omega_doom> does anyone know how to solve the problem "your local changes would be overwritten by cherry-pick" after rebase --continue although all files are staged?
[18:49:23] <cousteau> I don't see how it could be made easier

[19:02:39] <dmlloyd> it would amend a previous commit and then rebase the rest of them
[19:02:57] <dmlloyd> all-or-nothing, fail on error
[19:03:22] <cousteau> Keep in mind that `git commit` doesn't do any diff magic, just transforms the current index (list of added files) into a commit
[19:03:49] <cousteau> So it would need to make some sort of "smart amend" that also implies some sort of rebase

[22:18:17] <ledtc> Hey guys!  If i have a project that made of two parts.  Like i got this boilerplate that hold all config and communication code. And then on top of that i want to code diffrent applications independent of each other, but i when i update the boilerplate i want every "branch" "app" "univers" to the changes. How would i got about this ?
[22:18:24] *** Joins: rishi (~rishi@anamika.lostca.se)
[22:19:22] <cbreak> ledtc: you could make that boilerplate into a library
[22:19:52] <ledtc> cbreak Would changes to it register on git ?
[22:20:04] <cbreak> depends on how you use it...
[22:20:17] <cbreak> you can make a repository for the library, and use that repo as submodule in the other repos
[22:20:18] <ledtc> Like when i push or pull would it say "Hey that libary has benn update should i fetch ?"
[22:20:25] <cbreak> then you'd have to manually update them all
[22:20:28] <cbreak> no.
[22:20:30] *** Quits: rishi (~rishi@anamika.lostca.se) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:20:44] <cbreak> if you want it to be this automatic, put everything in one repo.
[22:21:01] *** Joins: rishi (~rishi@anamika.lostca.se)
[22:21:41] <ledtc> cbreak Sure, but if i understand branches corrrectly they freeze time. So a branch would not be update if the boilerplate was ?
[22:21:52] <cbreak> of course not
[22:22:05] <ledtc> Is there a branch-ich feature that would do ?
[22:22:11] <cbreak> branches have nothing to do with your problem
[22:22:25] <cbreak> your applications would be subdirectories, next to the library.
[22:22:30] <ledtc> Nah thought so, that why i turned here.
[22:22:37] <ledtc> and my question was to long for google
[22:22:42] <cbreak> all in one repo. That's the only way to force the change onto users
[22:22:52] <ledtc> But how would i deploy that ?
[22:22:54] <cbreak> I think this requirement is silly though.
[22:23:23] <cbreak> the normal way? compile it, package the binaries, and upload them to some download server, waiting for users to download and install them
[22:24:25] <ledtc> Well, its for micro processors, and they to diffrent tasks, so i cant have all the code for appilcations on every one. But they all share 2 or 3 classes of communication
[22:24:27] <cbreak> deployment is not something git is involved with, normally
[22:24:47] <ledtc> I just wanna like pull this and that.
[22:24:57] <ledtc> git pull A + B would be sweet
[22:25:02] <cbreak> I'd probably use that library as submodule
[22:25:18] <ledtc> git has a submodule mode/feature ?
[22:25:21] <cbreak> but that would require manual baby-sitting of the submodule
[22:25:25] *** Joins: gordonfish (~gordonfis@user/gordonfish)
[22:25:42] <cbreak> git submodules are repositories that are bound to some place in an other repository
[22:25:56] <cbreak> you can think of it as pinning a commit of a git repository into place
[22:26:16] <cbreak> for example, your fancy_application git repository has a fancy_application/libs/boilerplate submodule
[22:26:48] <cbreak> boring_application and colorful_application can also have that repo as submodule
[22:26:55] <cbreak> but they can pin different commits.
[22:27:08] <cbreak> managing this would be the manual work you would have to do, if you chose to go this route
[22:27:32] <cbreak> git will ensure that the pinning of commits is maintained, so it'll always be compatible, but that means updates are manual
[22:27:55] <ledtc> So i pins a commit of the boilerplate to the application instance ?
[22:28:44] <ledtc> Well if we spin it arround to avoid and XY problem here, How would you do it ?
[22:28:46] <cbreak> that's one option, yes
[22:28:56] <cbreak> submodules are the option I would chose.
[22:29:07] <cbreak> unless I have specific reasons to chose something else
[22:29:26] <cbreak> for example, alternatives could be to use a package manager like pip, for python, and bind via a requirements.txt file
[22:29:45] <cbreak> or to invert the dependencies, and have an outer repo that pins the application and boiler plate together
[22:29:50] <ledtc> would that not be a problme with password and api-keys
[22:30:03] <cbreak> (that last option might be useful if those applications are meant to interact, and should be kept in sync)
[22:30:20] <cbreak> ledtc: no? I don't use passwords and api keys
[22:30:55] <ledtc> Se these microdevices call home to a flask server so i could add i version check that says hey you boilerplate is outdated.

[23:38:40] <AsenMx> Hello, can you guys advice me on few topics? It is about a devops team, we are newly build team, we are looking for some good practices how to set up our processes and way of working. I'm looking for advice about terraform best practices, jira best practices ( should we use some jira template), documentation structure and stuff like that. Any advice is more than welcome.
[23:39:15] <ikke> That's quite a broad question
[23:39:23] <tang^> I would propose the same answer you got in #ansible
[23:39:37] <tang^> and include, crossposting will only hurt your answers
[23:40:32] <ikke> AsenMx: Asking more direct questions will lead to better results. There are lots of articles about best practices in all sorts of fields
[23:41:46] <AsenMx> Like i said in ansible as well i just look for more opinion and general directions how to approach this. Sorry if its off-topic and annoy some of you guys. I promise i won't ever ask non git related questions here.
