[01:05:15] <baltazar> and fsck's manpage says it uses PATH, and only falls back to /sbin if PATH is undefined

[01:09:59] <Edu4rdSHL> baltazar, I just saw lol, however it's systemd which creates the systemd-fsck-root.service in https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/55c09511e13c6a57ffe64bef4a9d0a00f34d37d9/src/shared/generator.c#L74

[01:13:08] <Edu4rdSHL> https://paste.rs/Akk
[01:13:58] <baltazar> Edu4rdSHL: I guess it might be that fsck-ing the root partition happens in the initramfs, and your initramfs doesn't have the fsck.btrfs executable
[01:14:17] <Edu4rdSHL> Mmm, good idea

[04:12:49] <Ghosthree3> also iirc docker can be made to use nftables, or rather to NOT use iptables, then you define the rules it would have set with iptables in nftables manually

[04:41:22] <thurstylark> I've had good luck with an extension that unloads tabs after inactivity
[04:41:27] * thurstylark is definitely the same way
[04:42:15] *** d42- is now known as d42
[04:44:44] <Baphomet> thurstylark: it unloads but keep open (like on Firefox's Tree Tab Unloader subextension), or by unloading you mean closing it?
[04:45:00] <Baphomet> And, would you mind sharing the extension name?
[04:45:44] <thurstylark> it keeps the tab open, just replaces the content with a blank page that's easier on memory.

[05:22:59] <bjonnh> Ghosthree3: going back to pure nftables with NetworkManager it works perfectly
[05:24:09] <bjonnh> libvirt wants dnsmasq to serve dhcp and dns to the vms, but systemd-resolved breaks that. Looks like systemd-networkd require some more love to not require systemd-resolved. 
[05:24:32] <thurstylark> wat
[05:24:46] <thurstylark> dnsmasq and systemd-networkd work fine together
[05:24:49] * thurstylark does it all the time
[05:25:26] <thurstylark> you don't have to involve dnsmasq in the host's network config for libvirt to do what it needs
[05:26:21] <bjonnh> I need NAT

[15:17:47] <Sinbad> Hi, I have been using msmtp/fdm for ages. Now that google is about to inhibit accessing mail accounts by password using third party apps, I am trying to use oauth2 methods for my tool chain. I have succeeded with msmtp but got stuck with fdm even building fdm from its git repo. The main problem seems to be fdm's inability to obtain a password from pipe like msmtp does with the passwordeval
[15:17:50] <Sinbad> method. I would welcome suggestions to overcome this problem.
[15:18:03] <grawity> patch fdm to do that
[15:18:26] <grawity> the bigger problem is that oauth2 tokens aren't sent the exact same way as passwords ‚Äì similar, but still not the same
[15:19:02] <grawity> supporting OAUTHBEARER authentication is the real requirement, obtaining passwords from pipe ends up being part of the implementation
[15:19:02] <raster> Sinbad: gmail?
[15:19:25] <Sinbad> grawity: fdm works if I copy/paste the recent access password into the config file
[15:20:02] <Sinbad> so fdm provide outhberer method but not the passwordeval
[15:21:00] <Sinbad> the git build of fdm has the outhbearer method

[18:20:11] <MacGyver> It's a shame the Steam Controller's gone the way of the dodo.
[18:20:20] <red_> MacGyver: yup. xow seems to be the answer for me. it's the "usb dongle" that takes some config to get it to appear 
[18:20:35] <demonicmaniac> you could just use a sane gamepad
[18:20:38] <MacGyver> Makes me wonder how long software like sc-controller will be supported.

[18:24:19] <red_> what remains: CUPS config for the brother, xbox wireless usb dongle support, and perhaps wallpaper engine support through KDE plasma. I know all are possible - it is a matter of me making it happen.

[18:24:34] <demonicmaniac> steam does the remapping in the background for stuff launched via steam at least
[18:24:34] <MacGyver> So you don't *need* the application to be SDL in order for steam's mapping to work, that much I do know.
[18:24:38] <demonicmaniac> yes
[18:24:50] <demonicmaniac> but steam uses sdl2 controllermap api/config for that too
[18:24:52] <jelle> MacGyver: steams mapping never worked for my xbox bt controller
[18:24:56] <MacGyver> But it's probably SDL -> evdev -> whatever the application then uses.
[18:25:06] <jelle> ah I know why, because it's not there yet :p
[18:25:09] <demonicmaniac> it exists as a standalone tool to generate mappings too but you can also just write them per hand

[18:27:25] <MacGyver> Anyway, I really do hope Valve will at some point make another run.
[18:27:31] <demonicmaniac> mind you sdl can't remap things like gamepad to send mouse events or touch events
[18:27:31] <MacGyver> Or a v2.
[18:27:44] <demonicmaniac> its gmecontroller is a simple axis button mapping
[18:28:07] <MacGyver> demonicmaniac: Then how is Steam doing the mouse input from trackpad events?

[19:37:32] <vitali64> the tor browser is available on the normal repos iirc

[19:37:44] <vitali64> that is the name of the package
[19:38:03] <vitali64> aephos: did you try with another key?
[19:38:31] <ds> aephos: when you say you get the same error, do you mean literally "gpg --search-keys torbrowser@.." or when also passing --keyserver keys.openpgp.org?
[19:38:35] <aephos> I see. When I searched for "arch linux tor browser" the top hit was the AUR package, and from past experience most AUR packages are AUR packages because there's not a non-AUR package.

[23:22:48] <Baphomet> Tbh I am quite new to journalctl... Why isn't it showing any of that with just journalctl (without -f)? Shouldn't I have seen this infinite-loop of crashes by scrolling to the end of journalctl's standard output?
[23:23:02] *** Quits: futune (~futune@95.82.133.115) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:23:40] <grawity> probably due to a journal file being corrupted in a way that journalctl can't scan forward through?
[23:24:05] <grawity> if you ask it to show the last X lines (whether with -f or -n), it reads the file from the end instead
