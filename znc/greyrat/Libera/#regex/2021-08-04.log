[01:33:07] <re101-beaver-67> got it
[01:34:55] <re101-beaver-67> im trying to understand ungready modifiers. why first match its "abce bbbb abceabce" not abceabce. as i understand ".+?" must be lazy
[01:35:46] <re101-beaver-67> why regexp (i saw it in debuger) continue search after first "abce"?
[01:44:33] <NiLon> abce doesn't match a.*ea
[01:45:16] <NiLon> it being lazy makes no difference there
[01:46:22] <re101-beaver-67> i dont understand. a.+e not eq abce?

[01:47:15] <NiLon> a.+e is different from a.+ea

[01:52:59] <NiLon> yeah
[01:53:01] <NiLon> !html
[01:53:01] <perlbot> Do NOT regex HTML/XML/JSON! Instead, consider using the appropriate parser in your programming language of choice. (http://bit.ly/1G8p6VH)
[01:53:50] <re101-beaver-67> im trying to find only <i>...</i><i>...</i>... matches

[12:14:54] <friend> I think I am going about this all wrong I was hoping to match a string input into two categories: one that was just the +-number and the other was +-number% (where +- are optional)
[12:15:36] <friend> but the input string could be +50.389% which would need to go in the second match as +50%
[12:16:21] <purplex> you can make +- match 0 or 1 times
[12:16:43] <friend> (^[+-]\d+)  gets the basic number, but I need to separate it if it is followed by %
[12:16:47] <purplex> to get +50% from +50.389% needs replacement
[12:17:21] <friend> (^[+-]?d+) gets the base number, sorry
[12:18:36] <friend> I thought (^[+-]\d+(?:\.\d+)?\% would give me 50%

[16:25:39] <teut> that will be sufficient
[16:26:21] <digitok> k :)
[16:30:52] <digitok> fwiw, this seems to do it 07"this is a test".replace(/ ([a-z])/g,(m,c) => { return c.toUpperCase(); });
[16:32:55] <teut> how do you know I need it in js?
[16:33:21] <teut> ok , obviously camelCase
[16:33:23] <digitok> was just assuming based on your link
[16:34:16] <teut> oh ok
[16:34:23] <digitok> :)

[23:32:23] <Venia> The default? 
[23:32:28] <Venia> I haven't changed this. 
[23:32:45] <Venia> I'm not directly responsible for using the GREP system and the person doing it has never actually used InDesign. 
[23:32:45] <OnlineCop> BSD is the default on OS X; you can install GNU grep via homebrew, etc. Most other OSes use GNU.
[23:33:00] <Venia> Gotcha. 
[23:33:04] <Venia> He is on a windows device
[23:33:32] <Venia> So that says GNU
[23:33:35] <OnlineCop> Basically: Are you searching via BRE (basic regular expressions), ERE (extendex regexes), PCRE, or something else?

[23:37:59] <OnlineCop> Venia: I just mentioned that you probably want to escape the '{' as `\{` or `[{]`. https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/1
[23:38:15] <OnlineCop> Could you update the TEST STRING with some text that you want to capture/match?
[23:38:34] <Venia> Oh yes, that is done
[23:38:49] <OnlineCop> re101-falcon-86: Could you show an example? `s/(\d+),(?=\d)/$1/g` might work, depending on your inputs.
[23:39:05] <Venia> {Thanks for your inquiry! / Youâ€™re one step closer to your dream wedding! / Woot! Thanks for reaching out! /Oh hey there! Thanks for reaching outâ€”I canâ€™t wait to hear all the things!}
[23:39:29] <OnlineCop> Venia: https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/2
[23:39:36] <Venia> each slash must be highlighted in the color of the avatar decided upon. each / corresponds to a different avatar. the order is consistent. 
[23:39:57] <Venia> yup! 
[23:40:34] <Venia> so now the problem is that I have to break it up, and still have it target each specific avatar.  InDesign's greps need them to be seperate for the paragraph text to apply just 1 singular format. 
[23:40:36] <OnlineCop> I don't exactly understand what 'avatar' means in this context, but does each '/' correspond with the text on the left, the right, or "it depends" like in the case of avatar2 and avatar3 ?
[23:41:24] <Venia> "avatar" is referring to a marketing audience.  the /s' seperate each avatar (there are 4 of them) and each avatar has to be colored a different color. 
[23:41:53] <OnlineCop> Also: `.*?` can allow extra '/' characters to match, if there are more than 3. Do you want to specifically exclude them with `[^\/]*` in place of `.*?` ?
[23:41:58] <Venia> The GREP posted above works just like I had it, but the problem is I have to split it so that it's 4 different GREP styles
[23:42:21] <Venia> That might be a good idea actually.
[23:43:36] <OnlineCop> Venia: Could you explain what you mean by "split it"? Given either line 1 {stuff/.../last stuff} or line 2{Thanks...all the things!}, what do you want each match to contain? (You could click FUNCTION->Substitution on the left if that would help you get each group.
[23:44:53] <OnlineCop> For example, do you want the `{` to be part of avatar1's group, the first `/` to not be part of any group, the 2nd and 3rd `/` to be part of avatar3's group, and `}` to be part of avatar4's group?
[23:45:50] <OnlineCop> Or do you want `\{(?'avatar1'...)\/(?'avatar2'...)\/(?'avatar3'...)\/(?'avatar4'...)\}` where '{', '/' and '}' are excluded from the captures?
[23:45:52] <Venia> Sure, here's a revision that includes color: {<purple> Thanks for your inquiry! </purple> / <blue> Youâ€™re one step closer to your dream wedding! </blue> / <red> Woot! Thanks for reaching out! </red> / <yellow> Oh hey there! Thanks for reaching outâ€”I canâ€™t wait to hear all the things! </yellow> }
[23:46:25] <Venia> Each grep style is applying a highlight of that color to the text. the " / " seperates where each grep is applied. 
[23:46:49] <Venia> the " / " are seperators - they are not part of the portion to be highlighted.
[23:47:01] <OnlineCop> Is <red>...</red> literally found within the text, so you want to exclude the '/' of '</red>' ?
[23:47:19] <Venia> nope, it is not found within the text - I am adding that so it shows where the highlight is to be applied. 
[23:47:30] <OnlineCop> Okay, gotcha.

[23:50:09] <Venia> all of the text is natural text. It can indeed include non-alpha numeric characters. 
[23:51:03] <Venia> That is why, I ensured they were using "/" between twoo words (example: either/or) and not (either / or).  This way the unique space characters (example: " / ") is targetable whereas "/" is not. 
[23:51:43] <OnlineCop> It would be good to have some "/" sample text in there if you could add it (then click "Update Regex" in the top-left corner: not "Save Regex").
[23:51:50] <Venia> It's possible they messed up because the document is 300 pages long, but where it does mess up we will immediately know and can simply go in and fix individual instances - this won't be too difficult
[23:53:04] <OnlineCop> It's not terribly difficult to handle '/' that aren't ' / ' (leading/trailing space) so it can match both. I don't want to get TOO fancy in case the version of grep you're using doesn't support the features. (GNU grep using the `-P` [PCRE] flag can handle advanced features just fine.)
[23:55:25] <Venia> I've done so.
[23:55:47] <OnlineCop> Once you Update Regex, it should change the URL to have a /5 version at the end.
[23:55:49] <Venia> I don't want it to match both, I want it to exclude "/" and include " / " which is why I have the 
[23:55:53] <Venia> \s in there.

[23:59:45] <Venia> [  ]   is for default filler text that they need to replace with something custom/personalizedâ€”names, dates, locations, price, etc.
[23:59:45] <Venia> < >  is for notes/instructions inside the email (that they don't need to replace with something customized... they just need to delete it)
