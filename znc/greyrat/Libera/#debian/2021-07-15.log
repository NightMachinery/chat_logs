[00:00:18] <calamari> I suppose I should try to create a new package for my change then, huh? :)
[00:02:56] <ratrace> I think the upgrade process is remove + install, which would imply unlink + installation of new files, thus clobbering teh symlink. at least I think.
[00:03:12] <ratrace> calamari: there's a thing called.... uhh.... defer? lemme google.
[00:03:18] <greycat> dpkg-divert
[00:03:31] <ratrace> divert!
[00:04:18] <ratrace> !divert
[00:04:18] <dpkg> Don't try to convince dpkg to overwrite files and don't start playing with "--force" options for dpkg. Instead, "divert" one of the files out of the way so that there is no conflict. See man dpkg-divert and also http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ap-pkg-diversions.html. Working with the package management system is much easier than trying to work against it.
[00:04:31] *** Quits: biblio (~biblio@45.83.220.217) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[00:04:59] <Poster> it may be safer to name the modified something different and create an alias to it; alias command=/path/to/modified/command
[00:05:13] <ratrace> so I suppose you'd dpkg-divert the file into new location so the package installs to that new location. like same directory, but a .dpkg-diverted suffix or sumfin liek that
[00:05:17] <jmcnaught> calamari: what file are you replacing?
[00:05:38] <calamari> jmcnaught: /usr/share/themes/TraditionalOk/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml
[00:07:16] <greycat> Poster: that only works if the thing you're replacing is a shell command, run by interactive shell users
[00:07:18] <calamari> ratrace: divert looks promising, thank you

[00:07:38] <greycat> Poster: and in that case, you'd be better off just putting your version in /usr/local/bin which will be in PATH before /usr/bin
[00:07:54] <calamari> I think I'll also see if I can just package it up as a new theme, that might be the best solution
[00:08:40] <calamari> s/package/tar/
[00:09:11] <jmcnaught> Maybe try putting it in /usr/local/ or ~/.local/share too
[00:09:17] <Poster> yeah - that would work too, I incorrectly assumed it was a command and it was an unpriviledged user
[00:09:48] <Poster> but that wouldn't make much sense for overwriting a package provided file =S
[00:10:22] <calamari> Poster: yep, I have my own ~/.bin with path priority for programs I want to change
[00:11:10] <calamari> that way it doesn't mess with root either
[00:11:52] <ratrace> calamari: ~/bin is in default PATH, no need for ~/.bin
[00:12:40] <greycat> some people just gotta be different
[00:13:12] <calamari> ratrace: perhaps you're thinking of /bin
[00:13:30] <greycat> (I'll point out that ~/.local/bin is also placed into the default PATH)
[00:13:34] <ratrace> calamari: no, I'm thinking of ~/bin  which is at the beginning of $PATH in default skel'd user .bashrc

[00:14:07] <Arrowmaster> that only applies if the default ~/.profile exists and is loaded
[00:14:08] <ratrace> ~/.profile, not ~/.bashrc, my bad
[00:14:24] <greycat> Arrowmaster: yup
[00:14:41] <Arrowmaster> and if .local/bin is in there then my .profile is outdated
[00:14:51] <Arrowmaster> but it never gets loaded anyway
[00:14:52] <calamari> cool, that's news to me
[00:15:00] <ratrace> Arrowmaster: it's there :)
[00:15:05] <calamari> well I'm already set up this way so no reason to change it haha
[00:15:11] <greycat> it pays to look at the files in /etc/skel/ once in a while just to see if anything has changed
[00:15:41] <greycat> the bigger issue is all these people who use Display Managers to log in
[00:15:51] <Arrowmaster> I dont use bash so I dont care if its changed
[00:16:02] <ratrace> aww!
[00:16:10] <Arrowmaster> and yeah using sddm and kde, none of that gets loaded
[00:16:31] <ratrace> for DMs you alter ~/.xsessionrc.... well... at least for lightdm you would...
[00:16:47] <Arrowmaster> at this point its different for every display manager
[00:16:54] <ratrace> sad.
[00:17:05] <greycat> .xsessionrc is read by everything that runs X, in Debian (it's a Debian specific tbing)
[00:17:27] <greycat> thing

[09:31:39] <Katana_Steel> I've only done some of the basics, but I think you'd have to pass the server's hosts file via a mount or there should be a resolve.conf/dnsmasq type service within the k8s cluster where you can configure custom host name mappings 
[09:32:50] <Katana_Steel> My thought would be in either the pod description or pod compose, similar as one would with docker-compose
[09:34:14] <Deesl> okay.. but their instructions work just fine on ubuntu 18.04
[09:34:40] <Deesl> They actually recommend using GCP for the labs.. I wanted to replicate using Vmware.. and inadvertently used Debian 11 instead of Ubuntu...
[09:34:53] <Deesl> and bam... it complains about DNS

[16:53:18] <ratrace> mikoto-chan: I think you fubar'd it so much that only chroot and careful cleanup and reinstallation of systemd would help
[16:54:04] <mikoto-chan> ratrace: might as well install another distribution in that case which doesn't use systemd
[16:54:29] <ratrace> if your goal is no systemd, a dedicated distribution is perhaps the wisest option, yes
[16:55:09] <ratrace> also, make sure you read apt output before confirming actions. this one even bore a nice warning about removing essential packages and not proceedign if you don't know what you're doing :)
[16:55:44] <mikoto-chan> I just never learnt how to use systemd properly because I was too fast with distrohopping, not to mention that I always have to turn on testing because packages are too old on Debian

[16:57:26] <ratrace> it's only when you start needing advanced features that you'll have to learn systemd ... quirks and peculiarities.

[17:31:54] <karma> then how would i go about installing the system on sda2

[17:33:22] <Haohmaru> well i really think "sda1" won't work, becaus i think the install image begins with a partition table and stuff, it is meant to be sploshed at the beginning of the medium

The OS is designed to make all that happen, piping output as input to the next thing down the line. I would break it up into multiple lines for ease of maintenance alone and on that I will stop-- because any socially aware person can pick up that you seem to want a one-liner.

[21:45:57] <sney> xx: qt5 is a lot of different library packages, your program should be specific about what it actually needs. the 'qtbase5-dev' package has a few of them, optimized for building qt applications, and maybe that's what you're doing

[22:10:44] <Red_M> or proxmox is another good example
