[01:03:52] <hassoon_> Fenderbassist: nah not really
[01:04:35] <hassoon_> leif84: right, i ate a big red apple this morning and went out for a ~3km+ walk, kept it up until eating something around ~2:30PM
[01:05:48] <Fenderbassist> I like to think of my cooking as a somewhat controlled collision between ingredients resulting in a crash :)
[01:06:07] <Fenderbassist> sounds good, just make sure you're getting enough protein
[01:06:14] <Fenderbassist> that omlette was a good source
[01:06:36] <hassoon_> Fenderbassist: yep, 2 eggs and plenty of vegetables and tuna
[01:06:45] <hassoon_> for teh maximum energy/nutrition possible
[01:06:56] <hassoon_> i could live on one of that for a whole day i'd say
[01:07:01] <hassoon_> i'll try it
[01:07:03] <Fenderbassist> maximum nutrition on protein is about 30 grams per meal I think
[01:07:13] <Fenderbassist> I usually do 4 eggs to get close to that amount
[01:07:20] <hassoon_> tuna and egg are full of that afaik
[01:07:31] <Fenderbassist> oh yeah tuna is a good source
[01:07:37] <leif84> nissin foods
[01:07:38] <Fenderbassist> 2 eggs and a can of tuna will get you your 30
[01:07:50] <hassoon_> the salad too :D
[01:08:07] <Fenderbassist> what besides lettuce?
[01:08:26] <hassoon_> i integrated the salad with the egg before starting to cook it, and it turned out good
[01:08:31] <hassoon_> tomato
[01:08:40] <hassoon_> and pieces of carrots
[01:09:40] <hassoon_> looking forward to seeing your recipes, Fenderbassist 
[01:10:01] <Fenderbassist> carrots - fiber, sugar, beta carotein and the mixed carotenoids I think.....tomato - lutein & lycopein I think....lettuce (if romaine or similar) - various nutrients (but if iceburg lettuce then just water and fiber)
[01:10:39] <Fenderbassist> a good blend
[01:10:46] <hassoon_> yep :D
[01:12:11] <Fenderbassist> you could certainly live on that for a while if you chose
[01:12:21] <Fenderbassist> I don't know if you want that much bread / carbs but if you can burn it off then cool
[01:12:55] <Fenderbassist> me, at my advanced age, would do 1/4 of that bread
[01:12:59] <Fenderbassist> :D
[01:13:15] <Fenderbassist> young guy like you can burn it off probably easily
[01:13:26] <hassoon_> y athat bread is enough to kill hunger and give me back my energy
[01:13:29] <hassoon_> ya that *
[01:13:52] <Fenderbassist> you must have a good metabolism :)
[01:14:34] <hassoon_> ya could be :p

[01:15:02] <Fenderbassist> I do all my own cooking, have for most of my life, I consider it more functional than visually appealing :)

[03:15:38] <SaiyuBudokkai> poot meat :3
[03:15:40] <emmeka> *almond beverage
[03:15:46] <emmeka> you show me the tit on an almond
[03:15:50] <MootPoot> yes, thats why they dont call it just "meat" its "someting"+"meat"
[03:15:59] <MootPoot> I dont really see why this is such a big deal
[03:16:04] <emmeka> there's already a word for "soy meat"
[03:16:06] <emmeka> it's tofu.
[03:16:37] <SaiyuBudokkai> what's the most awesome anime you watched recently?
[03:16:37] <MootPoot> I wouldn't call an impossible burger a tofu burger exactly
[03:16:45] <emmeka> I dislike this marketing crap, like, plant proteins are good. I eat a lot of tofu and pulses. but why the fuck is the food industry bound and determined to try and force them to be bacon and hot dogs and hamburger
[03:17:01] <Fenderbassist> more money
[03:17:03] <emmeka> they're not, afterall. you can make perfectly good dishes with those ingredients. so why force them to be fake meat?
[03:17:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: well cause something like quail meat is indeed meat
[03:17:12] <MootPoot> you have to couple a new idea + something familiar with people to accept it easier
[03:17:39] <emmeka> MootPoot no instead most of those non-meat burgers are basically just yellow pea meal and binders
[03:17:55] <emmeka> they're in fact, very similar in composition to a lot of pet food
[03:18:01] <emmeka> marketing!

[03:24:55] <emmeka> MootPoot but yeah personally like, I don't eat meat extremely frequently really, maybe 3 times a week recently?
[03:25:22] <MootPoot> emmeka: I went from once every 2 months to almost daily 
[03:25:25] <emmeka> I eat a lot of plant proteins and they're quite good, and cheap
[03:25:32] <MootPoot> I'm familiar with both 
[03:25:37] <emmeka> but for fucks sake stop trying to make them into meat products
[03:26:04] <MootPoot> How else are you going to sell to all the average people who don't consider a meal real unless it has meat in it 
[03:26:10] <MootPoot> They kinda have to 
[03:26:16] <emmeka> why try to make fake meat, when lentils are great in and of themselves? and there's a bazillion tofu dishes. and so on.
[03:26:46] <MootPoot> If you can make the average American adopt that idea then we wouldn't need any of this fake meat shit 
[03:27:35] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you are saying "Americans need to be lied to

[05:50:20] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: even tho the Beatles are a bit before my time, they are timeless
[05:51:25] <Fenderbassist> what's so amazing is that they made all that music (sometimes with the help of others) at their age, and experimented so much in the studio
[05:51:57] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I especially can relate to John Lennon cause he also had a Japanese wife
[05:52:03] <Fenderbassist> this song was the first time (I believe) that people heard a bass guitar plugged directly into the mixing board instead of using a bass amp and a microphone

[05:52:53] <amigojapan> Let me see
[05:52:54] <Fenderbassist> that's the song where people first really heard him clear as day instead of buried in the mix
[05:53:00] <Fenderbassist> was an interesting choice to make
[05:53:38] <Fenderbassist> and changed the sound of bass players
[05:53:47] <Fenderbassist> having the bass so up front
[05:53:54] <Fenderbassist> (for that era's tech)
[05:55:00] <Fenderbassist> Paul McCartney started out playing bass plucking with his thumb and through the usual type of amp in the earlier days
[05:55:05] <amigojapan> I see
[05:55:55] <Fenderbassist> and by this era he switched to using a pick to pluck strings instead of his thumb, and also switched from a small Hofner violin short scale bass guitar to a Rickenbacker standard scale bass guitar
[05:56:05] <Fenderbassist> so the sound was clearer
[05:56:17] <Fenderbassist> not as "buried" in the background
[05:56:42] <amigojapan> I see, a bit technical for me
[05:56:54] <Fenderbassist> playing with your thumb to pluck the strings is a very dark sound
[05:57:04] <Fenderbassist> playing with a plastic guitar pick to pluck the strings is a very bright sound

[06:23:14] <Nanobot> Motion capture technology has advanced a lot in the last few years.
[06:23:19] <MootPoot> at most the headset is wired these days
[06:23:41] <MootPoot> also you can just take off the headset too
[06:23:55] <MootPoot> it might break face tracking but you can still track the body
[06:24:58] <Nanobot> I'm pretty sure they're using Hollywood-like motion capture equipment, not the stuff you use for VR games.
[06:25:18] <amigojapan> ah ok Nanobot, makes sence
[06:25:23] <MootPoot> the venn diagram for those technologies overlap quite a bit
[06:25:23] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: ah I wasn't aware, that's neat

[06:48:51] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: also, I think part of the thing with the beattles is that all 4 of them could compose music
[06:49:19] <Fenderbassist> yeah, they were very talented

[06:55:24] <Fenderbassist> you could
[06:55:40] <Fenderbassist> you could also get a treadmill

[07:00:22] <Fenderbassist> well you can solo walk outside until you are, I suppose
[07:00:22] <MootPoot> tbh the way to do it is to make things physically inconvenient for you
[07:00:46] <MootPoot> to encourage more movement
[07:00:54] <MootPoot> dont put all the computers in the same room, etc

[08:02:19] <Fenderbassist> interesting
[08:02:24] <milkshake> my god, must be true then. cant beat age and genetics. maybe i need to be grateful i still have hair
[08:02:28] <Fenderbassist> guess he had a look eh?
[08:03:18] <Fenderbassist> milkshake: do you take b complex or silica vitamins? they're support to help that
[08:03:42] <milkshake> metalhead needs to have long hair, headbanging while being bald is just kpop
[08:04:01] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: yes, he calls it the "jesus hair" what he had before
[08:04:06] <Fenderbassist> I see
[08:04:30] <milkshake> Fenderbassist: i never take other supplements in my life other than vitamin C and omega 3
[08:05:07] <milkshake> i (maybe) trust my unhealthy diet
[08:05:24] <milkshake> breakfast lunch dinner all chicken
[08:05:47] <milkshake> and lot of sugar intake
[08:05:51] <Fenderbassist> web search "supplements for hair" if you're interested
[08:06:02] <Fenderbassist> that is an unusual diet
[08:06:16] <Fenderbassist> high protein which usually requires low sugar, but then also high sugar (carbs)
[08:06:35] <Fenderbassist> well I suppose you have options to consider
[08:07:16] <milkshake> damn, my body needs a lot of fix. belly fat while being skinny, caries, uneven hair growth
[08:07:54] <milkshake> and i sleep like 4 hours a day on weekdays
[08:08:18] <milkshake> idk if i would survive if i hit 40s 
[08:08:47] <Fenderbassist> are these things by choice or forced by circumstances?
[08:08:58] <milkshake> definitely choice
[08:09:20] <Fenderbassist> that's good
[08:09:22] <milkshake> i got back home from work around 7pm, i could sleep early but opt to sleep at 11pm
[08:09:35] <Fenderbassist> it means you can adjust things as needed
[08:10:02] <milkshake> i can i tried, but fail
[08:10:02] <Fenderbassist> if it were me, I'd add a very good quality multivitamin to the mix
[08:10:09] <Fenderbassist> there's always tomorrow
[08:10:24] <Fenderbassist> maybe one of these tomorrows you will decide for a change
[08:10:24] <milkshake> and lack of discipline
[08:10:29] <milkshake> maybe

[08:10:39] <Fenderbassist> and that's an advantage
[08:11:12] <amigojapan> milkshake: or you could stop caring about looks so much
[08:11:14] <milkshake> just need to be grateful i dont have chronic disease early on my life, like those unlucky people out there.
[08:11:33] <milkshake> amigojapan: in 2022?
[08:11:39] <amigojapan> yes
[08:12:12] <milkshake> i think thats another option, i need to lower my expectation, its ok to date ordinary girl
[08:12:15] <amigojapan> milkshake: looks cant last forever
[08:12:50] <milkshake> exactly
[08:13:00] <Fenderbassist> be good to yourself and you will be better prepared to be good to someone else if you're trying to meet someone
[08:13:22] <Fenderbassist> a balanced diet will serve you well
[08:14:13] <Fenderbassist> chicken and sugar, devoid of the phytonutrients of vegetables, fiber, essential fatty acids (omegas), enzymes, etc.
[08:14:17] <milkshake> i'll start with a good diet and enough sleep first
[08:14:30] <Fenderbassist> cool, that would do you some good :)
[08:14:56] <milkshake> sugar is my addiction though, i dont count, but Malaysian food are very high in sugar, i expect a 100g sugar a day
[08:15:14] <milkshake> thats excluding carbs
[08:15:19] <Fenderbassist> I see
[08:15:24] <milkshake> my coffeee and tea need sugar too
[08:15:29] <Fenderbassist> I can understand why that would be a challenge
[08:16:02] <milkshake> i dont know how long till diabetes kick in, but i checked my dxt its on normal range
[08:16:12] <Fenderbassist> you have time to change, I would think
[08:16:16] <milkshake> perhaps i need a hba1c or fasting blood sugar test
[08:16:23] <Fenderbassist> perhaps
[08:16:55] <Fenderbassist> you could also consider alternate food choices....using stevia instead of sugar, more complex carbs and less simple carbs, etc.
[08:17:01] <milkshake> i definitely have time , i just waste most of it
[08:17:04] <Fenderbassist> you have optinos and time to think about it
[08:17:15] <Fenderbassist> options*
[08:18:18] <milkshake> health is expensive even while still being healthy
[08:19:10] <Fenderbassist> it can be
[08:19:23] <Fenderbassist> though there's plenty of inexpensive (at least here in USA) healthy foods
[08:19:49] <Fenderbassist> usually it's the proteins that cost more
[08:19:59] <Fenderbassist> quality complex carbs don't have to be that expensive

[10:55:28] <Nanobot> Is there any way to restore Firefox's behavior to show focus rectangles around links when you click them? They removed it at some point, and now it's really annoying to keep track of where I left off when I'm going through a long list of links, opening them in new tabs.
[10:56:25] <Kill-Animals> Nanobot: Might I reccomend using QuteBrowser instead? Its vim bindings, and absolutely wonderful to use.
[10:56:29] <Sadale> Nanobot, weird. I could still see the focus rectangles if I use the "tab" key

[10:56:47] <Nanobot> Sadale: They only appear for keyboard navigation, not mouse focus
[10:56:51] <Sadale> oh
[10:57:01] <Kill-Animals> and if you want to focus rectangles, you just press f, and each rect is highlighted with a key combo to access it.
[10:57:04] <Nanobot> They used to appear when you click links (including wheel-click)
[10:58:39] <Nanobot> Kill-Animals: I'm not changing my browser for this. If I have to, I'll make a user stylesheet to fix it. I just wish there were an option somewhere. There's "browser.display.focus_ring_on_anything", but that's a bit excessive.
[10:59:03] <Sadale> Nanobot, this guide does the opposite of what you want. But may lead you to somewhere: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1274940

[11:20:40] <Kill-Animals> And have been watching anime beginnings, trying to analyze which have the best hooks, and describing them.

[11:55:27] <ButterNoodle> the script had that set to 2gb... which was fine for a small vm..
[11:55:35] <ButterNoodle> not good for a box with 64gig of ram
[11:56:10] <Bco1981> yes, i mention that too. that if this install is just a test VM 1gb is good enough.
[11:56:15] <Zoidberg> swap space? what are you talking about Bco1981? you already have way too much ram.
[11:56:44] <Bco1981> but yeah 64gb box is... a lot. but if ya want hibernate you need 1:1 ram to swapspace
[11:56:50] <ButterNoodle> someone gave me the idea of putting all my aur packages in my own local repo.. so now I have that :| and an ansible to add that repo to all my installs
[11:57:03] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: lol i was just thinking about that yesterday too
[11:57:14] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: u need that kernel parameter to read from swap on resume

[11:57:52] <ButterNoodle> I am doing that on my laptop w efi and full encryption
[11:58:04] <Zoidberg> why in local repo? you people have pretty good internet connections
[11:58:27] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: I dont want to mirror the repos.. but making my own cache of aur stuff I use is nice

[12:20:59] <DunceCotus> its some kind of synthetic purgatory
[12:21:16] <JesseDesu> DunceCotus, u think ur trapped
[12:21:20] <DunceCotus> some Meta version of reality
[12:21:27] <JesseDesu> in a body
[12:21:33] <JesseDesu> reliving someone elses memories
[12:21:47] <JesseDesu> like a movie but with full sensory experience
[12:22:21] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: well my actual notion of what we are is some kind of composite entity like an information monster
[12:22:46] <DunceCotus> we wear our sense of reality like a VR visor made out of percepts and affects
[12:23:03] <JesseDesu> maybe each human life lived leaves behind a a data container
[12:23:06] <DunceCotus> we are also that visor though, so its complicated
[12:23:25] <JesseDesu> that can be plugged in and experienced by another sentient life form
[12:23:42] <DunceCotus> human life expired, and now we're running on gas
[12:23:42] <JesseDesu> thus we are not really in 2022
[12:23:58] <DunceCotus> this is a synthetic reproduction
[12:23:59] <JesseDesu> but we're in a future billions or trillions of years 
[12:24:21] <JesseDesu> DunceCotus, anything is possible
[12:24:36] <JesseDesu> did you see that episode of rick and morty
[12:24:59] <DunceCotus> I am aware of the rick and mortys
[12:25:08] <DunceCotus> I don't think its wholly accurate
[12:25:11] <JesseDesu> the one where they stick tubes in a head apparatus
[12:25:32] <DunceCotus> there is no 'base reality', the Virtual is primary
[12:25:52] <DunceCotus> but what I am saying is our desire for human lives is draining I think
[12:26:04] <DunceCotus> thus human life becoming more synthetic, more forced
[12:26:14] <JesseDesu> well yea
[12:26:19] <JesseDesu> AI is coming

[12:26:50] <DunceCotus> its just not (only) digital
[12:27:18] <DunceCotus> instead this is an AI made up of analogue and digital components
[12:27:21] <JesseDesu> DunceCotus, you are limited to 3 quack theories at a time
[12:27:26] <DunceCotus> however yes reality these days is far more digital than ever before
[12:27:30] <JesseDesu> any more and your head will explode
[12:28:10] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: im not especially adherent to any of them
[12:29:55] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: I mean you're right, human-created AI is coming
[12:30:05] <DunceCotus> or at least life-like AI
[12:30:20] <DunceCotus> its just I dunno, we're already synthetic I think
[12:31:50] <DunceCotus> some kind of infinite resolution synthetic reality-production
[12:32:25] <DunceCotus> which is really a composite monster wearing different parts of itself to experience different realities
[12:33:52] <DunceCotus> by combining different parts in different ways, it produces various reality streams

[13:51:15] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I got an idea for a business which does not seem to be fully accomplished online now
[13:51:55] <amigojapan> Hi btw Cryowolf 
[13:51:59] <Cryowolf> hello
[13:52:09] <Cryowolf> so a business that nobody or few do but many need?
[13:53:05] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: how about offering a service to carve messages into stone from an online form? Withought shipping. Just keeping them in a location
[13:53:32] <JesseDesu> are you good with a dremel
[13:53:37] <amigojapan> At an affordable price
[13:53:50] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, what's the hook?
[13:53:54] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: never tried, I doubt it
[13:54:29] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: well if you want to leave a message that lasts forever, that's a good way
[13:55:15] <Cryowolf> well it doesn
[13:55:20] <Cryowolf> err let me rewrite this
[13:55:32] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: can a Dremel actually carve stone?
[13:55:49] <JesseDesu> yes
[13:55:53] <JesseDesu> it can cut steel
[13:55:58] <JesseDesu> with the right bit
[13:56:14] <Cryowolf> well it doesn't last forever but it can last a long while. Still where are you planning on preserving it? What's the appeal? Is there a spiritual component to it? Is there's a shinto component? Do you have a location where they can be stored ceremoniously without disturbance?
[13:56:42] <amigojapan> Nice Jesse, maybe I should try, especially since I just want to leave a binary number on the side of a mountain

[13:56:54] <ImoutoBot> [title] How To Carve Rocks With a Dremel Lite Cordless Rotary Tool
[13:57:30] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: more like an Egyptian stone
[13:57:45] <amigojapan> Ty Jesse
[13:57:58] <Cryowolf> I can see theh appeal of hand carved messages in very difficult to reach places of spiritual signifiance where you have permission to carve
[13:58:17] <Cryowolf> for spiritual people
[13:58:36] <Cryowolf> it won't become a big business, but it'll be a niche business that might last
[13:59:01] <Cryowolf> especially if you overcharge (that makes it seem more important too, to these types of people)
[14:01:11] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: a side of a mountain. Maybe one after they mined stone sounds ideal to me but not sure
[14:01:15] <Cryowolf> do you have Shinto shrines in the mountains that would allow you to handcarve (deep) carvings into the stone to leave messages for people who pay for it. Wishes if you will
[14:01:47] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: this has nothing to do with Shintoism
[14:01:49] <Cryowolf> People pay for you to deliver their wishes to a Shinto holy place
[14:01:55] <Sapphirus> Shikkakumon no Saikyou Kenja is some high quality trash
[14:01:58] <Cryowolf> no but religion or spiritualism sells
[14:02:32] <Cryowolf> and I  'm a morally flawed person so I can look at that and see the exploitability
[14:02:37] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: in that case I guess a deal can be cut with some Shinto shrine 
[14:03:57] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I would want the link to my web page carved in binary
[14:04:05] <Cryowolf> wishes are a big deal in Shinto afaik
[14:04:17] <amigojapan> They are Cryowolf 
[14:04:26] <Cryowolf> but people wou ldn't want their wish to be public or it might noit come true
[14:04:58] <Cryowolf> perhaps you could come up with a representation of their wish in a combination of kanji and binary
[14:05:25] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: wished are often shown in public on ema (wodden blocks you write on with a brush)
[14:05:49] <Cryowolf> yeah but not tied to a person right?
[14:06:02] <amigojapan> Right Cryowolf 
[14:06:20] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: but I think the display area can be public
[14:07:04] <Cryowolf> yeah as long as you don't tie it to a person. You should photograph the shrine in 3d so you can map out the area virtually
[14:07:10] <Cryowolf> and they can walk around the wishes
[14:07:59] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[14:08:00] <Cryowolf> or you can make the 3d area in unreal engine
[14:08:06] <Cryowolf> from photographs
[14:08:18] <Cryowolf> then add the wishes much more easily, same as you do IRL
[14:08:23] <Sapphirus> my cat won't stop bunting my laptop
[14:08:56] <Cryowolf> making sure they're handcarved is important, people who pay for this type of stuff are likely to pay a higher premium  price if it's made by  hand
[14:08:58] <Cryowolf> and not power tool
[14:09:43] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I would not mind if a carving tool is used for my message
[14:09:57] <Cryowolf> the customers probably would
[14:10:25] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: and then we need a special person specialised in have carving 
[14:10:34] <Cryowolf> its very impersonal and for someone that's spiritual enough to pay for this, they want it to feel more connected
[14:10:43] <amigojapan> Hand carving*
[14:10:49] <Cryowolf> you know what I mean?
[14:11:07] <amigojapan> Yes
[14:11:12] <Cryowolf> if they're spiritual and all that, chances are they're not gonna have the same pragmatism we do
[14:11:27] <Cryowolf> rather they will see hand carvings as a connection to their wish and so on
[14:11:37] <Cryowolf> like you're channeling their wish for them
[14:11:55] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I guess I could contact the people who make tomb stones
[14:12:01] <Sapphirus> I never got the money thing with spirituality and I like to think I'm a spiritual person, kinda.
[14:12:11] <Cryowolf> or contact monks
[14:12:54] <Cryowolf> say a percentage will be donated to their temple and that your idea is to channel the wishes of others from across the world to there
[14:12:59] <Sapphirus> Maybe it's my understanding that throwing money into a wishing well doesn't actually accomplish anything.
[14:13:27] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I actually know one monk in person
[14:13:38] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: but Buddhist
[14:14:33] <Sadale> I wonder if someone in the temple would collect the money from the wish well
[14:14:58] <Sadale> Otherwise the money would get piled up to the point that you wouldn't toss new coins into the well anymore
[14:16:22] <Sapphirus> I'm sure that's what happens.
[14:16:50] <Sadale> Makes me wonder how they could convert the coins into banknotse en masses
[14:17:03] <Sapphirus> That's simple. Take them to the bank all rolled up.
[14:17:14] <Sapphirus> It's an arduous task, but doable.
[14:17:15] <Sadale> lol true
[14:17:31] <Sadale> They take handling fee tho :(
[14:17:47] <Sapphirus> Worth it for money that's free*
[14:17:52] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, then you can write on your page that a percentage goes towards a donation for the temple where their wishes will be carved and channeled. 
[14:18:01] <Cryowolf> that loosens some peoples wallets
[14:18:32] <Cryowolf> I am sounding quite machiavellian aren't I?
[14:18:54] <amigojapan> Hehehe Cryowolf 
[14:23:24] <Sapphirus> Sounds like something a church would do.

[14:25:56] <Sapphirus> I almost feel as if anything one says on IRC will be immortalised.
[14:26:06] <amigojapan> Lol
[14:26:52] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: maybe I can just store it in archive.org but that is not as good as having a stone carving
[14:27:04] <Sapphirus> Lots of people have loggers in their clients and who knows if historians in the future might through this filth ;P
[14:27:20] <Sapphirus> might trawl*
[14:27:48] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: they are now likely to comb they web sites
[14:27:55] <amigojapan> More likely
[14:29:12] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: and if anything on the internet lasts it should be the pages on archive.org I bet
[14:29:40] <Sapphirus> Perhaps, but webpage archiving is becoming increasingly difficult to do with the modern internet.
[14:29:46] <Sapphirus> It's not just simple HTML anymore.
[14:30:13] <Sapphirus> Chat logs from public chat rooms might actuall serve as a useful tool to gain insight into culture from our era.

[14:36:15] <amigojapan> I doubt it Sapphirus . For one thing, how would they get the logs?
[14:36:38] <Sapphirus> off of someone's hard drive
[14:36:48] <Sapphirus> or some internet site that archived 'em
[14:36:50] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: that's crazy
[14:36:56] <amigojapan> Oh
[14:37:06] <Sapphirus> There's lots of people that have loggers enabled in their clients.
[14:37:16] <Sapphirus> I'm sure data harvesting for historical purposes will be a thing one day
[14:37:58] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: you need to know the person with the logs at least. They are not publicly available
[14:38:13] <Sapphirus> For sure
[14:38:27] <Sapphirus> Although there are websites you can find online with published room logs
[14:39:20] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: once these people die the information is likely going to be lost
[14:41:47] <Cryowolf> I still have logs from like 2006 or something like that

[14:42:01] <Cryowolf> I think I have from dalnet too from 1998
[14:43:25] <amigojapan> I guess putting my message on the internet archive is almost as good as carving it on stone, except I need to find a prominent place to display the image that won't disappear in the future
[14:44:33] <death916> according to github my code is in the arctic repository stored or something
[14:44:35] <amigojapan> Maybe another page on the internet archive that is meant to display such messages

[18:07:06] <Fenderbassist> funny you mention that Urchin[emacs] 
[18:07:09] <KatrinValerie> I think there is pizza in the freezer
[18:07:14] <Llamamoe> I still haven't caught a single infectious disease since half a year before the pandemic, lol 
[18:07:15] <KatrinValerie> or is there?
[18:07:23] <Urchin[emacs]> Llamamoe: cool
[18:07:23] <Fenderbassist> I just did a COVID test just now at home with one of the government-provided home tests
[18:07:35] <Fenderbassist> negative :)
[18:07:36] <Llamamoe> OTOH a guy I know has been catching one after another this year. I think he's at like 5 or 6 so far within a few months .-.
[18:07:39] <KatrinValerie> Until I open the freezer it is in a super position, both containing and not containing any pizza
[18:07:51] <Urchin[emacs]> Fenderbassist: I did an official one when I was certain I had it
[18:08:00] <Fenderbassist> I understand
[18:08:08] <Fenderbassist> this is the fourth time I've been sick since the whole COVID thing started
[18:08:17] <Fenderbassist> within 72 hours it's usually completely gone
[18:08:20] <Urchin[emacs]> anyway, the way I spent the downtime was by watching Shakespeare

[18:08:25] <Llamamoe> Yeah
[18:08:27] <Fenderbassist> nice 
[18:08:38] <Llamamoe> I have another friend who got COVID, Delta so the least harmful variant so far
[18:08:46] <Urchin[emacs]> main character was a nice guy (if you ignore the rampant slavery)
[18:08:48] <Llamamoe> But she still got several month of horrible fatigue and never recovered fully 
[18:08:52] <Fenderbassist> Omicron or Delta?
[18:08:57] <Fenderbassist> I thought Delta was a nastier one
[18:08:57] <Llamamoe> Delta
[18:09:01] <Fenderbassist> I see
[18:09:05] <Llamamoe> IDK, was it? 
[18:09:07] <Fenderbassist> I guess I got it backwards :)
[18:09:08] <KatrinValerie> Yep it was
[18:09:18] <KatrinValerie> No you are right in my book as well
[18:09:24] <Fenderbassist> sorry to hear about your friend though
[18:09:24] <Urchin[emacs]> Omicron is the less bad one, AFAIK
[18:09:28] <Llamamoe> Ah
[18:09:44] <KatrinValerie> Omicron is considered less bad overall
[18:09:54] <Fenderbassist> Llamamoe: i hope your friend does recover fully
[18:10:04] <KatrinValerie> I am not sure if we even have data on immune naive people getting infected with it though
[18:10:06] <Fenderbassist> sounds horrible, that kind of fatigue, I deal with fatigue almost as bad
[18:10:26] <KatrinValerie> still didn't catch it here either
[18:10:30] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, Bet that the one that I've caught is omicron. It's still bad after two shots of pfizer. :-(
[18:10:42] <Urchin[emacs]> Omicron is virulent as fuck, though
[18:10:43] <Sadale> I can't tell if it's really omicron but most likely, it is.
[18:10:44] <Llamamoe> Fenderbassist: Hopefully but it's been a long time now :-(
[18:10:55] <Fenderbassist> Llamamoe: I regret to hear that man
[18:10:59] <Sadale> I know that it's defo COVID
[18:11:00] <Llamamoe> And yeah I really really don't want to catch it 
[18:11:00] <KatrinValerie> and our friend+ recently tested positive after she visited here, but we just had negative tests every day
[18:11:00] <Urchin[emacs]> few more mutations and it should just be another common cold

[18:24:11] <Sadale> Zoidberg, tired af. Need sleep all of the time
[18:24:54] <Urchin[emacs]> taking vitamin D regularly is a good idea, as vitamin D metabolizes into the actually active chemical in about 10 days, IIRC
[18:25:04] <Fenderbassist> good to know
[18:25:20] <Fenderbassist> my rheumatologist put me on it, and I'm glad he did

[22:42:32] <Llamamoe> I bought a "cherry" dye, but trying it on some of hair I cut in the past produced a color that seems a little too red for my tastes, I thought it'd be more purplish

[23:17:29] <dmnslr00> Urchin[emacs], I'm sorry to hear that.
[23:17:48] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] you should keep watching, it's pretty great. and the most recent episode had um, quite the scene.
[23:18:03] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: yeah, I do plan to
[23:18:12] <Urchin[emacs]> I picked up Beastars in the meantime
[23:18:25] <emmeka> Beastars sure is something

[23:19:38] <Urchin[emacs]> I watched first 5 episodes so far
[23:19:59] <Urchin[emacs]> I'm still in a slump anime-watching wise
[23:20:58] <emmeka> like it's a furry show, but one where the furry elements are in fact not a fetish-y gimmick and are absolutely essential to the plot. And hey, we get Studio Orange making it, showing us that CGI doesn't have to be garbage
[23:21:34] <Urchin[emacs]> what about BNA?
[23:21:46] <Bco1981> i have that on my list. furry or not, looks interesting.
[23:21:51] <emmeka> never got around to it, but heard decent things when it aired, Urchin[emacs]
[23:21:53] <Bco1981> beasters*
[23:22:07] <Urchin[emacs]> I've moved to reading more books lately
[23:22:32] <emmeka> Bco1981 it sure is interesting. wonder if we have any dates of S3 yet
[23:22:39] <emmeka> it was confirmed to be in production, I think
[23:22:52] <Bco1981> nice
[23:23:00] <emmeka> friggin studio orange, making a third season of Beastars before they make a second season of Land of the Lustrous
[23:23:07] <MootPoot> after watching that episode I just had post-anime clarity
[23:23:23] <emmeka> MootPoot it is one of those episodes
[23:23:25] <MootPoot> happy while watching it, sad afterwards because you know it's not real
[23:23:33] <MootPoot> :\
[23:23:41] <emmeka> where you watch it and you're just like "ahhhhhh. now I remember why I like anime. and now, the void."
[23:24:01] <MootPoot> where can I get a cute girl to take me places
[23:24:04] <MootPoot> oh wait, nowhere
[23:24:11] <MootPoot> becasue she dosen't exist
[23:24:12] <Bco1981> MootPoot: switch to hololive... the K-on/Love Live that never ends.
[23:24:13] <MootPoot> bleh
[23:24:30] <emmeka> but why would you want that. you'd have to go outside!
[23:24:35] <Bco1981> ^
[23:25:32] <MootPoot> emmeka: you managed to make your wife into a hikki 
[23:25:57] <emmeka> not really but we are home bodies. it does not help that she is not entirely well
[23:26:35] <emmeka> not that we don't go out, but the combination of COVID bullshit and her own health has limited things somewhat

[23:28:53] <emmeka> MootPoot so I showed her SAO a little while ago. Want to hear my wife's review of SAO.
[23:29:05] <MootPoot> lay it on me
[23:29:09] <MootPoot> did she watch all of it?
[23:29:11] <MootPoot> or just S1
[23:29:16] <emmeka> just S1
[23:29:40] <emmeka> and I quote "this is like the anime version of reality TV, that's how bad it is"
[23:30:22] <MootPoot> aha
[23:30:34] <MootPoot> I can agree on the bad part - but I dont see the reality TV link
[23:30:41] <Bco1981> but... it has nothing to do with tv or reality ?... you sure she even looked at the screen ?
[23:30:54] <emmeka> I think she meant it in the sense of comparable quality
[23:31:04] <MootPoot> storywriting quality?
[23:31:05] <emmeka> as in, she was saying "this is trash"

[23:34:29] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: I prefer to think of SAO as exactly the average anime
[23:34:45] <emmeka> mmmm I'm not sure that's really a good way to see it.
[23:35:31] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: incest, but doesn't go all the way, tentacle molestation that stop short of rape, shounen tropes executed shittily, etc.
[23:36:20] <emmeka> SAO, in its own time, was original. In ways both good and bad.
[23:36:26] <emmeka> it more or less defined a genre
[23:36:33] <Urchin[emacs]> it has the bare bones required to be great, just fails to execute on it
[23:37:00] <Urchin[emacs]> I'm not disputing it's popularity, I just don't think it's good
[23:37:18] <emmeka> well, good is besides the point of it being "exactly the average".
