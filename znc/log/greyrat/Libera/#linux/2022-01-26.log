[04:18:12] <tirnanog> I'd say awk as long as code and pattern editing doesn't become a chore in the longer term. the reasoning behind the perl solution was to allow for an arbitrary set of word arguments (which are, in fact, treated as substrings).

[05:09:48] <akk> (you can type groups to see if you're really in that group)
[05:09:48] <madprops> akk, i have logged out and rebooted. i think the problem is that the /dev files are not related to that group

[13:06:57] <mncheckm> I wonder though why this stuff isn't tracked, I mean with all the yada about support-based business models
[13:07:08] <mlu> most people are self-supporting
[13:07:26] <mlu> and if you need support, those qualified to provide it would recommend a distro
[13:07:31] <Sauvin> Then you're aware that you can set your user up to run specific commands as root.
[13:07:56] <mlu> put it this way: you pay for support so you don't ahve to go on distrowatch researching a solution
[13:08:28] <Sauvin> xingwozhonghua__, that's very probably the worst troll I've ever seen. There's no word for just how lame that was.
[13:08:30] <mncheckm> mlu, I do? oh

[13:09:50] <mncheckm> mlu, I wonder what distro would a paid rhel clerk recommend ;)
[13:09:56] <mlu> and the other 10% of the time, it's: pick Ubuntu or something RHEL-based (i.e. CentOS, RHEL)
[13:10:06] <Sauvin> Guest59, it's not cached on the shell. It simply expires after a set of time. When you launch stuff from point-clicky things, you launch entirely new processes having nothing to do with any shell, so at that level, caching isn't possible.
[13:10:29] <mncheckm> mlu, so you say like go to specific software vendors, check what they target
[13:11:11] <mncheckm> mlu, I guess that wouldn't be any more tracked anywhere? :)
[13:11:51] <mlu> mncheckm: well, most of the software vendors just talk about it
[13:12:01] <Guest59> I understand it is not cached by the shell, and its simply a feature on the side of sudo(maybe something underneath sudo?) that attaches a timestamp to a PID or something similar.

[17:01:30] <libh> What do you mean which distro? You have to install the kde portal to use the kde file picker and it tends to pull in a bunch of KDE/Plasma dependencies depending on the distro.
[17:01:57] <mrfb> I don't have to install any kde dependency for firefox have a filepicker
[17:02:12] <libh> No, I mean a file picker which thumbnail view when selecting a file.
[17:02:14] <mrfb> that's why I'm asking which distribution is that, where you have to install some kde dependency for firefox
[17:02:18] <akik> firefox opens some gtk file chooser by default

[20:32:21] <johnjaye> basically what i determined is grub has 2 parts, the part in the EFI that shows you the menu but it actually reads config data from the partition you're updating grub from
[20:32:30] <johnjaye> so if you deleted that partition (say fedora) then it won't work
[20:32:38] <johnjaye> then when it fails grub drops you to a rescue prompt
[20:32:44] <Gaboradon> Not really, unless it's some automatic thing, I followed a youtube guide and they said you have to do grub refresh on each unless OS prober is enabled by default
[20:33:44] *** Joins: veriwind__ (veriwind@user/veriwind)
[20:33:58] <Gaboradon> Now I see for  some reason Boot0001 is Fedora, even tho i specifically set the first one to be OpenSUSE and second one Manjaro with efibootmgr, or doing it from BIOS works differently than doing it from one of the distros with efibootmgr
[20:34:03] <johnjaye> by refresh do you mean the 'update-grub' command?
[20:34:22] <Gaboradon> Right sorry, yeah update-grub, I think, right?
[20:34:38] <johnjaye> yes. that doesn't change the efi variables. just the menu on each linux partition you run it on
[20:34:47] <johnjaye> so if it points to a non-existent fedora it won't boot
[20:34:50] <Gaboradon> Which I didn't want to do, so I skipped all of that, it worked fine for weeks like that.
[20:35:32] <Gaboradon> I wanted to clean the Fedora's files out of /boot/efi completely but perhaps I hold off on that, I'll go do that right now, if I didn't do it already

[20:36:27] <johnjaye> my guess is if you can get grub to boot manjaro or something you can rerun 'grub-install' and 'update-grub' commands to fix it. but ask in #grub for more specific advice
[20:36:48] <johnjaye> sometimes the install disks have live environments which let you do something similar as well but iirc you have to chroot
[20:36:54] <Gaboradon> johnjaye: boot/efi/EFI/fedora has 12 files, while OpenSUSE and Manjaro have only 1 , WTF
[20:37:12] <johnjaye> is it something like fedora.x64?
[20:37:16] <Gaboradon> So that's the thing where eeach new overwrites the last?

[20:40:44] <johnjaye> i don't know if it's safe to just start deleting things from the EFI partition though
[20:40:50] <Gaboradon> Question is, is this dynamic, if I perhaps set something else primary will these files be generated for the other OS, don't want to just poke into the raw files and mess around.

[20:41:26] <johnjaye> if you have a spare partition you could just install manjaro or fedora to it
[20:41:35] <johnjaye> then the installer will  update the efi vars
[20:41:44] <johnjaye> but simpler to use efibootmgr

[20:42:28] <Gaboradon> I wanted to distro test a number of them, ended up using OpenSUSE 24/7 so now I'm tied to the OS a bit, configurations, browser, chat, so I need this booted on one of the 3 machines to be able to talk here while doing the rest, I might want to move this install to a spare SSD solely without multi boot.

[21:43:34] <EtherMan> Hey. For multi processor systems, does linux take any consideration for what socket cores are on when spreading load? Like say an encoding job in ffmpeg, will it try to load up the entire job on 1 socket or will it try to spread it out on all cores in the system? I'm just thinking about with intel's scalable, you can have a lot of CPUs in a single system, but they're sort of limited by their links when you go beyond 2 or 4 CPUs (depending on the
[21:43:34] <EtherMan> specific model).
