[00:03:24] <Roey> o/ Joanna! :)
[01:16:09] <Joanna> Hi
[02:08:10] <Joanna> I see no activity in other channel today besides two trolls ...so sad

[04:42:41] <Joanna> Atque: it’s more active there and I discovered another troll to add to ignore list
[04:42:59] <Atque> Joanna: Who's that?
[04:44:55] <Joanna> ‘St0ner
[04:47:43] <jan6> name's a giveaway ;P
[04:48:17] <Joanna> Sure is .. I wonder if it’s hash ?
[04:48:30] <Joanna> Sort of talks like hash
[04:48:35] <Hydragyrum> pretty sure hash doesn't use alts though
[04:49:08] <Joanna> Maybe has same objectives as hash
[04:49:10] <Hydragyrum> and that `St0ner doesn't really talk much like hash at all -- hash likes his enter key
[04:49:23] <Joanna> Hmm
[04:50:07] <Joanna> They both like drugs and are know it alls
[04:50:38] <Hydragyrum> I mean, that's not an uncommon pairing
[04:50:43] <Atque> jan6: Yeah, he sounds like a stoner.
[04:51:10] <Atque> Yup, I'm kinda talking nonsense. Working atm. About to go on lunch.
[04:52:26] <Joanna> It seems like trolls wait in channels for  conversations to hijack
[04:53:06] <Joanna> Maybe they have scripts running to detect activity or key words
[04:53:56] <gartt> It's a lot of effort just to waste time
[04:58:39] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[04:59:08] <Atque> gartt: What if it's fully automated using GPT-J?
[05:07:16] <gartt> Then they'd deserve an award for making something almost good enough to pass a Turing test :)
[05:11:55] <Joanna> gartt: do you think it’s a bot?
[05:12:45] <Joanna> What is gpt-j ? Atque
[05:13:13] <Hydragyrum> GPT is a machine-learning thing for chatbots and the like
[05:13:41] <Joanna> What does it do look for key words ?
[05:20:30] <Hydragyrum> >machine-learning
[05:26:06] <gartt> Joanna: I doubt it, but he says enough weird stuff to be suspicious
[05:26:20] <gartt> Hydragyrum: Yeah, just began reading about it. Pretty cool
[05:41:14] <Joanna> gartt: what in particular tipped you off ?
[05:41:50] <Joanna> He sure was determined to give bad advice
[05:43:26] <Joanna>  What do you all think of mats1? I don’t think he is a bot.

[05:51:27] <Joanna> Do chat bots have predetermined sentences they use? Surely they are biased for a particular agenda.

[05:53:21] *** Joins: Fault (~Fault@152.70.112.168)

[06:19:55] <Atque> Joanna: I'm not sure exactly how its set up, but it's basically a massive (several billion parameter model) for completing sentences, code etc.
[06:20:32] <Atque> Joanna: It's an open source version of gpt-3 basically. I will try to find you a demo; it's pretty cool.
[06:22:07] <Atque> Joanna: This one: https://6b.eleuther.ai
[06:22:07] <SeaDough> ^ EleutherAI - text generation testing UI
[06:23:09] <Atque> Like, if I give it "One wintery night, my cat was sitting by the fire. She looked bored"... it gives after a minute something.
[06:35:44] <Atque> It says "One wintery night, my cat was sitting by the fire. She looked bored and started to walk away. I had been working on my thesis for weeks and was fed up with the cold. I grabbed my scarf and followed her, but she only seemed to walk away from me.".
[06:36:21] <Atque> So pretty good at doing things like completing sentences, but also good at computing "perplexity" - if a sentence looks abnormal.
[06:53:56] <Joanna> Hmm thanks I’ll look
[06:57:19] <Joanna>  I think I confused it. It seems to not understand what I said very well and only responds to first few words..
[06:57:42] <Joanna> It’s sort of like a web search
[06:57:52] <Joanna> Returning whatever..
[06:59:03] <Joanna> Bots can’t understand deep concepts I guess ..

[14:33:12] <Joanna> ?
[14:33:38] <jessicara> ai text prediction pretty much, in the form of an adventure game
[14:33:43] <jan6> basically AI-driven roleplay of....whatever
[14:33:55] <jan6> you can break the bounds if you want, and end up in another story
[14:33:56] <jan6> do anything
[14:33:57] <jan6> lol
[14:34:24] <Joanna> I once wrote bot scripts for a game
[14:34:31] <jan6> like in a "prison scenario" I ate the guard, and ate the door and eventually somehow became a wolf, or werewolf, or something
[14:34:43] <jan6> which I'm pretty sure if from some other story
[14:34:44] <jan6> lol
[14:35:29] <Joanna> Ai is just software that collects and uses data ?
[14:35:50] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@5.77.219.12) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[14:35:54] <jan6> so are humans, though
[14:35:54] <jan6> lol
[14:36:10] <jessicara> there was a time could do anything, then there was a time horses were filtered which is a problem in low tech scenarios
[14:37:00] <Joanna> Horses filtered ?
[14:37:03] <jan6> lol
[14:37:40] <Joanna> That sounds like a translator software fail
[14:38:55] <Joanna> jessicara: do you still go to freenode? What happens there these days ?
[14:39:16] <jessicara> i'm basically just sitting there
[14:39:33] <jessicara> about all that is happening is redstar trying hard to troll it
[14:40:10] <Joanna> I think I saw you when I went to visit the crazy person I know who is stuck. Have you ever met energon?
[14:40:27] <jessicara> i don't think i have
[14:41:06] <Joanna> He refused to come to Libera because the trolls told him they were from Libera !!
[14:42:47] <Joanna> I’d like to know who was funding the spammers and trolls during the transition. Remember that? I had spammers in every channel until I made them registered only
[14:43:30] <CalimeroTeknik> it would appear that there are so many volunteers
[14:43:48] <CalimeroTeknik> who needs funding? they do it for free!
[14:44:14] <Joanna> Have you ever tried to interrogate a troll to find out what it’s about?
[14:44:19] <CalimeroTeknik> not just one
[14:45:12] <Joanna> Some people troll for fun but many are paid professionals or bots
[14:45:18] <CalimeroTeknik> I was there during the entire "transition", got involved with most of the people, proposed constructive plans just to see what would happen
[14:45:38] <CalimeroTeknik> it's not "for fun", you're far from it
[14:45:47] <Joanna> What did you propose?
[14:45:59] <CalimeroTeknik> https://mensuel.framapad.org/p/freenode-feedback-faq-9nlv?lang=en
[14:46:01] <SeaDough> ^ Framapad mensuel
[14:46:17] <CalimeroTeknik> I organised this list of questions for Andrew to answer
[14:46:27] <CalimeroTeknik> eep, disappeared
[14:46:56] <CalimeroTeknik> last snapshot https://x0.at/iIAG
[14:47:31] <CalimeroTeknik> this allowed to prove that the "feedback" mascarade was a PR stunt
[14:48:04] <CalimeroTeknik> at the time, that's how constructive people were, trying to assume that Andrew might do as an overlord (the fools)
[14:48:12] <Joanna> I now believe that lee acquired freenode for the purpose of destroying it. By bribing forgot her name,
[14:48:20] <CalimeroTeknik> Christel
[14:48:28] <Joanna> Ya
[14:49:32] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm not a believer, rather a deducer from fact, and what I have are theories at most
[14:49:34] <CalimeroTeknik> in the order of how I like them: 1. foolishness; 2. vague entrepreneur business plan delusions; 3. desire of power/ownership; 4. sociopathy and pleasure to destroy
[14:49:51] <CalimeroTeknik> so your preferred one comes last in order but it's there
[14:49:59] <jan6> #3 is a certainty
[14:50:05] <Joanna> I didn’t want to be gullible and I couldn’t figure out what was happening so I did try to stay on freenode to see what new owner would do and he started by letting spammers and trolls take over support channel...
[14:50:12] <CalimeroTeknik> I have backing for all of these theories, yes
[14:50:34] <CalimeroTeknik> add "sheer incompetence" to 1.
[14:50:39] <jan6> yeah
[14:50:50] <jan6> I think incompetence is the main factor tbh
[14:51:05] <CalimeroTeknik> foolishness is just the generalization
[14:51:20] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.36.112.208)
[14:51:55] <jan6> given he's been involved with various tech things for a while, I don't think he WANTED to destroy freenode, but since it happened and was fun enough, he let it slide
[14:52:17] <Joanna> I’m not buying the incompetence think he is a successful person not some loser and he has experience with buying other irc networks like snoonet was it ?
[14:52:28] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, another explanation is the post-truth culture
[14:52:31] <jan6> he even made a few meek attempts at saving freenode, what with the "freenode is foss" and "now with free bouncers" and whatnot
[14:52:48] <jan6> he doesn't have to be a loser
[14:52:56] <CalimeroTeknik> he is a sociopath entrepreneur not unlike D. Trump
[14:53:22] <Joanna> If he had done nothing but moderate trolls freenode would still be popular
[14:53:24] <CalimeroTeknik> sociopathy and incompetence do not preclude making loads of money
[14:53:29] <jan6> just a trollish person who doesn't know how to have an atmosphere/culture conducive to anything but trolling and laid back chatter
[14:54:03] <Joanna> He probably got paid to destroy freenode to move people off irc and over to discord and slack
[14:54:12] <jan6> lol nah
[14:54:15] <Joanna> And was partially successful
[14:54:28] <jan6> technical chats are already on matrix and gitter, not discord and slack
[14:54:32] <CalimeroTeknik> I can't back your theory
[14:54:45] <CalimeroTeknik> so I don't see what to do of it
[14:55:01] <jan6> no self-respecting serious foss project would use discord or slack, in any case
[14:55:28] <CalimeroTeknik> at least no free software project would
[14:55:47] <Joanna> A lot of people left Irc thanks to lee destroying freenode. I know that as a fact with people I know who are gone.
[14:55:58] <CalimeroTeknik> "FOSS", no problem. "FLOSS", well, they try to keep their teeth clean so they would be a little more reluctant…
[14:56:25] <jan6> I think the fall of freenode is PARTIALLY intentional, but mostly just neglegence, like, he made SOME effort to show how "hey, freenode is foss, plz, stay at freenode...", but eventually just gave up on it
[14:56:27] <Joanna> Freenode had 90k users right?
[14:56:38] <CalimeroTeknik> a lot of people were wishing for IRC to disappear because it's not convenient on their iPhone™
[14:56:52] <jan6> yeah, freenode vs libera has a strong gap of users
[14:56:59] <Joanna> Irc cloud is ok for iOS
[14:56:59] <CalimeroTeknik> users, we don't know. this is a number of connections
[14:58:13] <Joanna> 48678 connections here
[14:58:14] <CalimeroTeknik> but no threads no emoji reactions no iNteGrAtiOn
[14:59:22] <jan6> irc can be integrated with ANYTHING
[14:59:26] <jan6> matterbridge is bae
[14:59:38] <CalimeroTeknik> if I go straight to the point, this is a culture clash: IRC is designed for literate people, not for people raised by twitter and facebook
[14:59:47] <jan6> yeah
[14:59:54] <Joanna> can you see emoji -> 😁
[15:00:03] <jan6> I can see : grin:
[15:00:05] <CalimeroTeknik> I can, but it's not an emoji reaction beside one of my messages
[15:00:08] <jan6> because of my filter script ;P
[15:00:32] <jan6> ,echo (jan6)++
[15:00:34] <jan6> lol
[15:00:44] <jan6> wrong channel
[15:00:52] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm actually pestered by e-moji, as I believe that they are poor communication means for my purposes
[15:01:16] <Joanna> I like text I don’t like empty space and big obnoxious banners and photos shown to me without my consent
[15:01:30] <CalimeroTeknik> I do occasionally suffer from being too much of the literate kind (it's not a quality, it's just a trait of personality)
[15:01:48] <jan6> heh
[15:01:50] <jan6> yeh
[15:01:53] <Joanna> I couldn’t have said it better irc is for literate people
[15:02:21] <jan6> indeed, the problem is there're more and more semi-literate people, and whinies
[15:02:50] <Joanna> How the heck can they program if irc is beyond their skill level??
[15:02:52] <CalimeroTeknik> it's clear that pure text chat, a tool we conceived to be agnostic to one's culture, isn't
[15:03:06] <jan6> copy-paste from stackoverflow, Joanna ;P
[15:03:11] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, they cannot program. It's a tragedy. They learn to "code".
[15:03:22] <jan6> also yeah, programming and coding are different things
[15:03:33] <jan6> and I can only script
[15:03:42] <Joanna> Irc can have links to photos and videos and that’s good enough
[15:03:47] <jan6> script not-so-much-kiddie
[15:03:56] <CalimeroTeknik> bah, scripting is a branch of programming
[15:04:16] <jan6> depends how you define the programming/coding distinction
[15:04:47] <Joanna> Scripting isn’t compiled right ?
[15:05:02] <CalimeroTeknik> I call "programming" the design of programs, and "coding" the process to actually encode the program into code (of a given language)
[15:05:14] <Joanna> Ah true
[15:05:28] <CalimeroTeknik> it wouldn't matter one bit if your script was actually "compiled" before execution
[15:05:45] <CalimeroTeknik> in fact, python compiles your "scripts" before execution
[15:05:49] <Joanna> I do both design and coding and testing
[15:06:13] <jan6> I just write everything in posix shell scripts >;P
[15:06:22] <jan6> (and sometimes a bit of python, when needed)
[15:06:40] <CalimeroTeknik> the people I call "coders" consider that architecture, design and programming are part of coding; my metaphor is that "C programming" is "Remington poetry"
[15:07:13] <jan6> who needs architecture anyway
[15:07:21] <jan6> just link up random parts with random other parts!
[15:07:24] <CalimeroTeknik> don't get it wrong, "Remington poetry" means that it so happens that you put the words of your poetry on paper using a Remington typewriter
[15:07:36] <CalimeroTeknik> (which I believe is irrelevant to the poetry)
[15:07:41] <jan6> aaa a aa a  a
[15:07:44] <jan6> aaaa a a aaaa
[15:07:49] <jan6> ^ poetry
[15:08:25] <CalimeroTeknik> "O my Remington I dream of thee" is another interpretation of the noun clause "Remington poetry"
[15:08:32] <CalimeroTeknik> but that's confusing the means with the goal here
[15:08:48] <CalimeroTeknik> s/goal/end/
[15:09:20] <CalimeroTeknik> and in light of that, "C programming" would be programming stuff that somehow can only be about C, like specific tooling
[15:09:35] <Joanna> I don’t like spaghetti code or redundancy
[15:09:51] <CalimeroTeknik> the question is whether what appears to be redundancy, is
[15:09:59] <CalimeroTeknik> correlation is not causation
[15:10:29] <Joanna> Maybe they have watched too many movies and think programming involves someone typing as fast as they can on a computer:)
[15:10:41] <CalimeroTeknik> the same value for two fields with completely different meaning doesn't necessarily means it's a good idea to make it unique
[15:11:12] <Joanna> The same code that does the same thing is redundancy
[15:11:16] <CalimeroTeknik> no, it's a honest mistake; when the sage points at the moon, the fool sees only the finger
[15:11:24] <Joanna> Lol
[15:11:38] <CalimeroTeknik> when I explain the program, the fool sees only code
[15:12:11] <Joanna> The code is not important the algorithms are
[15:12:18] <CalimeroTeknik> the program is relevant to the creation of the code, but the code is irrelevant to the creation of the program
[15:12:51] <CalimeroTeknik> I'd say that a program is an instantiated assembly of fundamental algorithms
[15:12:58] <CalimeroTeknik> for a task
[15:13:50] <CalimeroTeknik> and despite what I said, there's a caveat, here goes:
[15:14:17] <CalimeroTeknik> the code is irrelevant to the creation of the program, but when you look at the code, it's not irrelevant to how the program functions
[15:14:17] <Joanna> The program has a purpose which the code must fulfill
[15:14:32] <CalimeroTeknik> correlation is not causation, but correlation is very appealing
[15:15:25] <CalimeroTeknik> the program even formulates (formally) how to fulfill the purpose
[15:15:56] <CalimeroTeknik> the code is merely the encoding of the program into a machine language in order to use it on an automaton
[15:15:57] <Joanna> If you have bad code you will have a crash
[15:16:24] <CalimeroTeknik> this can find its origin in a defect in the program, of course
[15:16:42] <CalimeroTeknik> but it's possible that the defect was merely a coding error if the program was correct
[15:17:35] <CalimeroTeknik> well, it's difficult to hold this distinction to a mathematician, because mathematicians formalise everything, and something you don't propose a formalism (=an encoding!) for, is "not defined"
[15:18:34] <Joanna> You have to define your problem before trying to code it
[15:18:35] <CalimeroTeknik> but that's a fallacy: you can determine something unambiguously without necessarily defining it
[15:19:06] <Joanna> Do you have example of a program?
[15:19:10] <CalimeroTeknik> you don't code the problem though, rather a solution
[15:19:10] <CalimeroTeknik> the solution to a problem is a program, which you can (en)code into a machine language
[15:19:40] <CalimeroTeknik> I will continue speaking English
[15:19:43] <CalimeroTeknik> add one to each element of this list
[15:20:05] <CalimeroTeknik> this was a program
[15:20:13] <CalimeroTeknik> in order to express it, I had to formulate it formally in some language, here English
[15:20:15] <Joanna> There were programs long before computers.  I see a program as a methodology. Like making a cake for instance
[15:21:41] <CalimeroTeknik> a method to an end, yes
[15:21:41] <CalimeroTeknik> to achieve an end*
[15:21:41] <CalimeroTeknik> though abstract and general methods are called algorithms
[15:21:42] <CalimeroTeknik> only an algorithm doesn't really tackle a problem "in the field", it's a tool that's used among others to solve the practical problem
[15:22:14] <CalimeroTeknik> I would set the distinction here: algorithms for abstract problems, programs for practical problems
[15:22:44] <Joanna> Algorithms are methodology
[15:23:03] <CalimeroTeknik> > I see a program as a methodology
[15:23:30] <CalimeroTeknik> from an abstract standpoint, programs = algorithms
[15:23:37] <CalimeroTeknik> from a practical standpoint, not so much
[15:24:37] <Joanna> A program would be like a bakery and algorithms are each item on menu
[15:24:58] <CalimeroTeknik> I don't think that works
[15:25:44] <iz> an algorithm are like blueprints and a program is like the building built from them
[15:25:52] <Joanna> You start bakery program by starting work inside in the morning
[15:26:01] <CalimeroTeknik> algorithms in this metaphor are things like the concepts of an oven
[15:26:07] <iz> there certainly is not a distinction between the types of problems solved with programs vs algorithms -- it's the same thing
[15:26:18] <Joanna> Right
[15:27:00] <Joanna> The algorithms is the specifics of behavior but not attached to any particular language.
[15:27:15] <iz> a program is just the actual implementation of an algorthm that has consider practical issues like memory and computation
[15:27:20] <CalimeroTeknik> it's a method as you said, so you can express it however you like
[15:27:28] <CalimeroTeknik> express=implement
[15:27:50] <Joanna> Program is written in a specific language.
[15:27:51] <CalimeroTeknik> well, perhaps implementation is more restrictive than expression
[15:28:03] <iz> how do you get to thinking implementing it however you like changes the type of problem it solves?
[15:28:39] <CalimeroTeknik> the program doesn't have to be coded in a specific language
[15:29:02] <iz> regardless, it won't change the type of problem its solving from an abstract problem to a practical problem
[15:29:03] <CalimeroTeknik> though I suppose that to consider it an implementation you have to code it
[15:29:04] <Joanna> It won’t be a program if you can’t run it will it?
[15:29:37] <CalimeroTeknik> I can express programs in English but it's debatable whether I can run them
[15:29:56] <iz> you can express algorithms in english
[15:30:05] <CalimeroTeknik> maybe
[15:30:16] <iz> you can.
[15:30:30] <CalimeroTeknik> well, sure, I meant is it only algorithms I can express in English?
[15:30:48] <iz> if you have a compiler that can compile english into a program, then you can say english is a programming language
[15:31:01] <iz> or even an interpreter that could interpret what you write
[15:31:10] <CalimeroTeknik> the interpreter could be a human
[15:31:12] <Joanna> I’ve spent a lot of time trying to think about things before starting to program them and no matter how much I think ahead of time It is much more complicated than I planned
[15:31:16] <iz> but no one has made such a natural language compiler, so it's not a programming language
[15:31:28] <CalimeroTeknik> IBM used to have people do the computing, "computer" was a position
[15:31:33] <iz> CalimeroTeknik: what you are describing is an algorithm, not a program
[15:31:42] <jan6> lol
[15:31:45] <iz> pseudo-code is an algorithm description, not a program
[15:32:00] <jan6> it can also be a program
[15:32:02] <CalimeroTeknik> that's a consequence of your proposed definitions
[15:32:17] <Joanna> Computers were people who used calculators right ?
[15:32:19] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm just not certain which definition to pick
[15:32:33] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, they even did it without electronics at first
[15:32:40] <CalimeroTeknik> pen and paper as external memory
[15:32:57] <CalimeroTeknik> at the inception of IBM that is
[15:32:57] <Joanna> How about abacuses?
[15:33:02] <iz> you are claiming that algorithms solve abstract problems and programs solve practical problems and when you code an algorithm that solves an abstract problem into a program some how it changes the problem it solves into a practical one
[15:33:42] <CalimeroTeknik> the word you're looking for is "application"
[15:33:42] <iz> from that, i'd say your definitions aren't correct
[15:34:11] <CalimeroTeknik> I would agree with incomplete
[15:34:23] <CalimeroTeknik> incorrect, I don't see where (yet?)
[15:34:36] <jan6> now, where does a program end and an application start?
[15:34:39] <Joanna> Algorithms are like a methodology to do something
[15:34:40] <iz> you can't see the inconsistency with what i just restated?
[15:35:11] <iz> i've pointed it out clearly, if you can't see it, i can't force the horse to drink
[15:35:26] <jan6> drink the invisible water, DRINK IT
[15:35:40] <iz> haha, it's so crystal clear though!
[15:35:41] <Joanna> Is knitting a sweater a program or an algorithm or does it depend upon if it’s a human or machine doing the knitting?
[15:35:53] <CalimeroTeknik> iz, I did state earlier that from an abstract standpoint the difference is non-existent
[15:36:10] <CalimeroTeknik> which is your point, I think?
[15:36:30] <iz> 03:31 < CalimeroTeknik> I would set the distinction here: algorithms for abstract problems, programs for practical problems
[15:36:55] <jan6> if you write a program that literally only prints "hello world" then is it an algorithm, a program, or both?
[15:36:56] <iz> that's what you said and what i am pointing out is incorrect and inconsistent
[15:37:25] <Joanna> jan6: program it’s too simple to be an algorithm
[15:37:27] <iz> if you are setting the distinction, you aren't claiming the difference is non-existent
[15:37:40] <CalimeroTeknik> it's on a plane of intent
[15:37:54] <CalimeroTeknik> not just that, but that would at least somehow clear the fog
[15:37:55] <iz> lol omg, i'm out.. gonna make coffee
[15:38:19] <CalimeroTeknik> people call "algorithms" methods that don't come with a clear application in mind, don't they?
[15:38:39] <Joanna> See you later iz
[15:38:46] <CalimeroTeknik> but the definition you propose is interesting as well
[15:39:09] <iz> later all, i'll be back when fed and caffinated
[15:39:28] <Joanna> This is interesting conversation but I need to go afk :) laters
[15:39:30] <CalimeroTeknik> thing is, we ended up with these words, "algorithm", "program", "code" on our hands and are all attempting to make something consistent with them
[15:40:55] <jan6> while probably not consistent with book definitions, I'd say that algorithms are REUSABLE specific single tasks, which are often not worth much alone ("how to make a glass rod" isn't that useful most of the time), and programs often incorporate those reusable tasks ("heat the furnace, make a glass rod, then add it onto a vase as decoration")
[15:41:57] <jan6> algorithm (definition)
[15:41:57] <jan6> A well-defined sequence of steps, explained clearly enough that even a computer could do them.
[15:43:03] <jan6> code: A system of symbols and rules used to represent instructions to a computer; a computer program.
[15:43:21] <jan6> program: a series of instructions that can be put into a computer in order to make it perform an operation
[15:43:34] <jan6> so from these definitions, it comes out that
[15:43:49] <CalimeroTeknik> some define "program" as being necessarily in an (en)coded form
[15:44:04] <jan6> algorithm = "what do I do and how", code = "what the human writes" and program = "what the computer runs"
[15:45:10] <CalimeroTeknik> you could say "algorithm = how to do", "program = what to do"
[15:45:32] <CalimeroTeknik> leaving out whether the program has to take form in code or not
[15:46:06] <CalimeroTeknik> (what I'm doing here is decoupling concepts)
[15:47:11] <jan6> I like the way I ='d them better
[15:47:31] <jessicara> or, method, and a packaged up set of methods ready to throw at tasks?
[15:48:19] <jan6> naaah
[15:48:38] <jan6> Definition of method
[15:48:38] <jan6> 1 : a procedure or process for attaining an object
[15:48:52] <jessicara> that doesn't sound right
[15:49:04] <jan6> that's the dictionary definition
[15:49:14] <jan6> as were almost all the previous ones
[15:49:20] <jessicara> that's one of many definitions
[15:49:34] <jan6> it is the correct definition, too
[15:49:39] <jessicara> a way, technique or process for doing something
[15:49:44] <jessicara> is also a correct definition
[15:49:48] <jan6> that's the same thing
[15:50:05] <CalimeroTeknik> what about how VS what
[15:50:06] <jessicara> my english understanding is pretty bad
[15:50:14] <jessicara> i don't see them the same
[15:50:29] <jessicara> one sounds very different to another
[15:51:54] <jan6> you "do something -> e.g. output a number" or you "attain something -> e.g. attain the outputting of a number"
[15:52:10] <jan6> attain:    To gain as an objective; achieve.
[15:52:37] <jan6> also: To succeed in a directed effort, process, or progression.
[15:54:14] <jan6> so I'd say they're BASICALLY the same things, but worded differently, I don't see a difference between "I do X" and "I achieve end result of X" (well, assuming nobody else can do it)
[15:57:09] <CalimeroTeknik> I see a large difference
[15:57:23] <CalimeroTeknik> you might do something and not achieve the result you expect
[15:57:33] <CalimeroTeknik> "I swim" and "I reach the other shore"
[15:57:48] <jan6> well, no, I mean, with completed actions
[15:58:22] <jan6> "I swam to the other shore" and "I reached the other shore", where you need to get to the other shore without caring how
[15:59:25] <CalimeroTeknik> well, that's a useful distinction to fight "solutionism"
