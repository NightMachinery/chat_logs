[15:49:28] <iDrougge> Github displays a little angry ⛔️ symbol at the end of the file, and I know several Git clients do the same.
[15:49:38] <iDrougge> I think it's an old Unix convention.

[15:51:05] <wink> see, on CLI git I always mix up + and - newline at the end

[15:51:26] <wink> and I don't browse gh much these days
[15:51:51] <iDrougge> We use Github because we're lucky. The rest of the organisation uses AWS CodeCommit.
[15:52:00] <wink> I know some languages have that in their most common coding standards
[15:52:17] <wink> that's why I was asking
[15:52:23] <wink> i wouldn't say it is uniformly used
[15:52:50] <meyerm> what tools nag you not to have a line terminator for the last line?
[15:52:56] <iDrougge> Yes, from my perspective, it's Git forcing everything into the Git mould.
[15:53:55] <wink> meyerm: I file "putting it there by default" already as passive-aggressive nagging ;)
[15:54:26] <meyerm> yeah, sure, but I'm wondering what tools want there not to be a line terminator
[15:54:32] <meyerm> as in insist that you don't end your last line
[15:59:57] <lep> it's a tiny bit easier for parsers if you include a newline at the end of the file
[16:00:35] <lep> sometimes i just parse `input ++ "\n"` instead of fixing my parser

[18:09:17] <gwozniak> Once my coworked and I walked through the code and understood what it was doing, we both wondered how anyone could possibly think it was correct
[18:09:53] <companion_cube> ElTimo: I think sqlite is neat
[18:10:05] <epilys> it's very neat, but obviously imperfect
[18:10:19] <ElTimo> I do too, I just don't particularly enjoy using it since I'm used to big, fat MySQL
[18:10:41] <epilys> different things altogether. sqlite3 is application level, mysql is a server
[18:10:45] <ElTimo> True
[18:10:58] <companion_cube> yeah I'd compare sqlite to a .json file or something like that
[18:11:30] <epilys> a bunch of index cards
[18:11:36] <ElTimo> My only encounters with it have been when my old boss wouldn't let me do read-only queries on the live system, instead giving me a CSV and saying "figure it out"
[18:11:50] <companion_cube> you can load the csv into sqlite :p
[18:11:54] <ngoldbaum> at least with hypercard i get to explore a mysterious island where my data are stored
[18:11:56] <ElTimo> That's exactly what I tried.
[18:12:17] <gwozniak> I've used SQLite to query data for compiler tuning and investigation.  Useful that way.
[18:12:18] <companion_cube> I guess the alternative is panda, if you know the python world? (which i don't)
[18:13:05] <epilys> panda has a convoluted API, which is a big hurdle
[18:13:08] <ElTimo> I've heard of panda but I know nothing about it.
[18:13:14] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: not really pandas is basically an excel spreadsheet
[18:13:45] <ngoldbaum> i’m sure there’s a lot of overlap but they’re not exactly drop-in substitutes
[18:13:50] <companion_cube> I use sqlite in one tool, and the killer feature is to be able to rsync the files between computers
[18:13:58] <companion_cube> and still be super fast to parse
[18:14:54] <ElTimo> I just find SQLite makes you do a lot of work that other databases handle for you.
[18:15:02] <epilys> it's useful as a binary file archive: one weekend long ago I was bored and indexed all my blood work test pdfs into an sqlite3 database, with each pdf included as a BLOB  ( I do a lot and frequent blood work tests because of a lifelong illness)
[18:15:13] <epilys> now I can just backup my medical stuff in one file
[18:15:31] <ElTimo> For instance, SQLite doesn't have a simple "insert into...ignore if exists" query, while MySQL/MariaDB does.
[18:15:40] <companion_cube> ElTimo: I don't think it's comparable
[18:15:44] <companion_cube> it's files, not a DB server
[18:15:46] <epilys> ElTimo, it does? INSERT OR IGNORE
[18:15:49] <companion_cube> so it's also a lot less work
[18:15:55] <companion_cube> INSERT IF NOT EXISTS, too? idr
[18:16:15] <epilys> IF NOT EXISTS is for CREATE statements
[18:16:23] <companion_cube> ah yes

[18:22:26] <companion_cube> as easy as "sudo curl | bash"
[18:23:18] <ElTimo> Ok real talk though, how did sudo curl|bash become acceptable to run, let alone normal?

[18:23:40] <ngoldbaum> epilys: you KICK pip? you kick her body like the football? oh! oh! jail for epilys! jail for epilys for One Thousand Years!!!!
[18:23:42] <ElTimo> Just do an appimage at that point, ffs.
[18:23:45] <companion_cube> ever since platforms still don't have a standard packaging system I guess
[18:23:57] <companion_cube> appimage? using what?
[18:24:33] <ngoldbaum> install scripts solve a lot of issues for a project with limited resources and a desire to get the software widely deployed
[18:24:54] <companion_cube> it's also uniform across (posix-ish) OSes
[18:24:54] <ngoldbaum> of course they also create tons of issues and are a pain the ass to maintain as the world slowly changes
[18:25:04] <epilys> curl|bash isn't that different fundamentally from downloading and installing binaries or even compiling stuff you haven't personally inspected every line of the source code
[18:25:18] <ngoldbaum> but it’s one command to run
[18:25:22] <ElTimo> I think people overestimate the amount of work that goes into making an Appimage. As I understand it, you just box up your release directory in a tarball and change the extension.
[18:25:29] <ngoldbaum> a lot of people will look at long installation instructions and give up
[18:25:59] <companion_cube> ElTimo: what do you mean by appimage
[18:26:08] <ElTimo> Oh! It's a packaging format for Linux
[18:26:18] <ElTimo> It works very similarly to the old OSX DMG format.
[18:26:21] <companion_cube> oh ok
[18:26:26] <companion_cube> what kind of tool uses it?
[18:26:38] <ElTimo> Usually desktop stuff, but I've seen some server apps packaged up with it.
[18:26:50] <ElTimo> It doesn't require any kind of daemon or anything, either, which is super nice.
[18:26:58] <ElTimo> Just download the file and run it from wherever.
[18:27:03] <companion_cube> hum
[18:27:22] <ElTimo> Granted, that means there's no dependency management, but also no dependencies because everything's in one package.
[18:27:24] <epilys> the binaries/dependencies/environments w/e are super huge though
[18:27:27] <ElTimo> Yeah.
[18:27:30] <companion_cube> does it have a shebang or something?!
[18:27:51] <ElTimo> Yeah, I think when you run the appimage it calls a script in the archive.
[18:29:10] <ElTimo> The "install" process is super easy though. You just move the whole file somewhere in $PATH and name it something palatable.
[18:29:19] <epilys> GOG packages its games for linux somewhat like that: a huge shell script that contains the binaries as variables
[18:29:46] <ElTimo> That always tickled me. At my old job we used to embed a whole-ass base64-encoded tarball in our installer script.
[18:30:04] <epilys> open source!
[18:30:18] <ElTimo> Unrelated, but upgrades went so poorly at that place that we had to have a team dedicated to them.

[19:06:50] <ElTimo> companion_cube, It kinda doesn't compare to docker, from what I can tell. Flatpak seems squarely aimed at desktop apps, while Docker is designed more for server use.
[19:07:32] <ElTimo> Docker makes it really easy to make disposable environments, for instance, while Flatpak tries to make sure that one environment stays as intact as possible.
[19:08:33] <ElTimo> That said, they both work kinda similarly in that they both offer capability management and isolation.
[19:09:02] <ElTimo> Oh, Flatpak also offers the ability to depend on other packages, while Docker doesn't as far as I know.
[19:09:07] <ElTimo> Not in the same way, at least.
[19:09:07] <companion_cube> and both only work on linux natively, right? :)
[19:09:16] <ElTimo> Yeah, both are just for Linux.
[19:09:44] <ElTimo> Would be nice to see Flatpak on Windows, but I know the instant it landed Microsoft would fuck it right up lol
