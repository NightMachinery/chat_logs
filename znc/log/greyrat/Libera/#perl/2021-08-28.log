[01:48:59] <pragma-> It's very contextual.
[01:49:11] <pragma-> If the words didn't make sense next to each other it'd be more diffcult, certainly.
[01:49:14] <huf> you need to scramble the words juuust right to get that effect
[01:49:59] <huf> so yeah, being able to read camelCase is not a very good argument for it :D

[01:50:28] <huf> I'll grumble
[01:50:43] <huf> especially when I find sane_case in the older portions of the codebase
[01:50:55] <huf> but some fuck later decided to standardize to camelCase
[01:51:00] <pragma-> Certainly if they're mixing it with snake case, yes I'd have to point that out.
[01:51:06] <pragma-> Well, I don't know.
[01:51:09] <huf> and then there's absolutely massively fucked languages like go

[01:51:48] <Grinnz> gordonfish: well it's not EBCDIC, in that it's 0x4B

[12:46:47] <Mandevil> Guys, what's the recommended HTTP client library these days?
[12:47:15] <Grinnz> Mojo::UserAgent or HTTP::Tiny
[12:47:31] <Mandevil> Thanks, Grinnz
[12:47:48] <Mandevil> I know Mojo:UA, but not sure if I am going to use Mojo for this
[12:49:04] <Grinnz> just gotta know two things for HTTP::Tiny: it doesn't decode any responses (you always get bytes) and you have to check for http response code 599 which means there was a transport error
[12:49:43] <Grinnz> still way easier than error handling in LWP

[17:52:12] <revhippie> chiselfuse: It's operating on the "topic" variable, $_
[17:52:34] <chiselfuse> So, $ on its own means $_?
[17:52:39] <chiselfuse> Whate's the difference then?
[17:52:44] <chiselfuse> What's*
[17:52:56] <revhippie> No; the $ in the regex means "end of line or string"
[17:53:23] <revhippie> A bare /.../ is as if you applied it to $_, like:   $_ =~ /.../
[17:53:35] <chiselfuse> I see, much thanks.
[17:53:58] <revhippie> The regex itself is looking for a period -- escaped, because a plain . means "any character" -- then b, z, 2, and end-of-line/string.
[17:55:45] <chiselfuse> This conditional is preceeded with `for (@ARGV) {`    does this make elements of the ARGV array the "topic"?

[19:24:11] <leitz> chiselfuse, Perl has a lot of assumptions built it. They can be tough to learn, but when you "get" them they can make things a lot easier.
[19:24:26] <leitz> Though I'm still working on the "get" part.  ;)

[19:59:08] <Harzilein> hmm
[20:03:03] <Harzilein> has the meaning of this ever flip flopped or can i take any ol' perl version where it doesn't throw the "Can't use an array as a reference" diagnostic and infer the intended meaning from that?: https://metacpan.org/dist/psh/source/lib/Psh/OS/Win.pm#L154
[20:03:03] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ lib/Psh/OS/Win.pm - metacpan.org ]
[20:06:32] <thrig> perldiag seems informative about the message
[20:07:40] <Harzilein> thrig: it's not about what the message means. it's about what the code used to do when whatever id was doing did work.
[20:07:43] <Harzilein> it*
[20:08:25] <Harzilein> hmm
[20:08:59] <thrig> find a version of perl <= 5.22.0 and write some test case code for it based on what that Psh is doing
[20:09:02] <Harzilein> you are right, the perldiag manpage is informative enough...
[20:10:02] <Harzilein> in that i don't need to fear finding a version where this just happened to be in flux given its use of "<= v5.22.0"
[20:11:50] <dimbag> Hi, what is the equivalent of goroutine on perl ?
[20:11:54] <Harzilein> it now seems that omitting the @ would be enough to get the intended semantics
[20:12:05] <thrig> what is a goroutine?

[20:15:30] <thrig> what would you use it for?
[20:18:57] <dimbag> thrig, I want to run functions independent of each other.
[20:24:06] <simcop2387> dimbag: best bet for what you want is probably IO::Async::Function and it's friends

[20:33:50] <simcop2387> not that i'm aware of.  there are some things you can do though like run a mirror that contains the patched dist and such
[20:34:29] <Harzilein> hmm... but no such thing as overlay mirrors w/ plain cpan, is there? i'd need to actually host a webserver so i can make redirects?
