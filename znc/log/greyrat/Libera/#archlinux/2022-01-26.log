[00:50:45] <Earnestly> grawity: In general yes, but passwd is more difficult to justify
[00:51:03] <grawity> setuid passwd is convenient because it knows whose password it needs to change, and you changing your own password is a very different action from root *resetting* a user's password
[00:51:12] <Earnestly> Although "standard" rules could be made which allow passwordless use of passwd if has right arguments
[00:51:12] <grawity> the latter not asking for the old one
[00:51:37] <Earnestly> Yeah indeed

[00:52:45] <grawity> like sssd maybe, or systemd's thing
[00:52:48] <Earnestly> Yes, this is what I thought of, immediately reminded of factotum
[00:53:00] <grawity> or if each user had their own individual passwd file, with just their own data
[00:53:15] <Earnestly> But yes, it seems fairly reasonable to reimplement shadow and provide compat bits
[00:53:37] <Earnestly> /bin/login and the rest
[00:53:39] <grawity> so about half of the list is just updating the passwd/shadow files really
[00:54:17] <Earnestly> passwd.d would be nice, I wrote up a thing doing such things long ago
[00:54:27] <grawity> slightly related to that, unix_chkpwd is internally invoked by pam_unix when an unprivileged app (like your screensaver or i3lock) needs to verify your own password

[03:02:51] <seneram> McBeard: But in this case they dont have python-selenium in their repo and depended on the Community arch repo. However a needed Dep was removed 3 days ago and as such i was left with broken deps
[03:02:57] <MacGyver> And can still get away with *mostly* arch and then cherry-pick from blackarch as needed.

[03:28:24] <urawotlol> MacGyver: try windows task scheduler for the agent
[03:28:30] <MacGyver> TheDcoder: If you're currently using QXL for a virtual screen, it might be worth trying switching that to virtio.
[03:28:48] <urawotlol> virtio is generally better for everything in KVM
[03:28:55] <MacGyver> TheDcoder: But you'll need to manually install the drivers from the virtio-win driver CD.

[03:29:18] <urawotlol> rcf: probably
[03:29:22] <rcf> Nice
[03:29:43] <TheDcoder> MacGyver: Thanks for the suggestion, but I gave up on KVM many years ago due to the complexity and I am currently using VBox purely because it's easier to use

[03:31:19] <urawotlol> precisely

[03:37:04] <thurstylark> nvm then
[03:37:47] <TheDcoder> thurstylark: My point still stands though, VirtualBox is heaps easier to use and offers all of the functionality out of the box with a single interface
[03:37:54] <MacGyver> TheDcoder: FWIW, on arch (definitely nowadays) it's pretty much a breeze.
[03:38:11] <thurstylark> yeah, u need some libvirt for your vbox addiction
[03:38:11] <MacGyver> TheDcoder: And definitely easier to use libvirt than VirtualBox if you want any amount of integration.

[03:38:59] <TheDcoder> but I doubt it is AS easy as VirtualBox, which pretty much does everything without any manual setup (aside from adding your user to the vbox group)

[03:39:14] <thurstylark> yes, libvirt is as easy as vbox
[03:39:24] <urawotlol> is easier i think
[03:39:31] <urawotlol> virt-manager is way better

[03:39:47] <TheDcoder> thurstylark: Okay, I'll give it a go soon then :)
[03:41:04] <TheDcoder> MacGyver: To be fair, VBox does come with a nice GUI for USB pass-through. This is something non-power users would definitely prefer over messing with udev

[03:41:53] <TheDcoder> The only thing which I couldn't work out of the box is seamless window integration

[03:47:32] <MacGyver> *until* you start doing the kind of stuff I do.
[03:47:37] <TheDcoder> I could make a script which reads from a file etc., but maybe there's already a program someone has made for that

[04:28:35] <TheDcoder> I think VNC is bad for local viewing, if I recall correctly it uses JPEG to transfer the image, which is lot more intensive than simply sending a buffer of the screen with mininal processing

[04:30:04] <topcat001> from my linux system vnc to another linux system i roughly the same performance as rdp to a windows system on the same network (acrossa VPN).
[04:30:07] <MacGyver> My problem is with the (lack of) persistence.
[04:30:10] <TheDcoder> it also works over SSH, so it's secure assuming the server is trusted
[04:30:24] <topcat001> don't see much difference

[04:32:38] <TheDcoder> MacGyver: So SPICE works the best for you?
[04:32:54] <MacGyver> TheDcoder: For the second screen of this windows VM, yes.
[04:33:05] <aruhier> MacGyver: dropbear is packed in initramfs so you can ssh and crypt unlock the root partition
[04:33:06] <TheDcoder> Nice, what about the first screen?
[04:33:06] <urawotlol> MacGyver: if you have the time write a wiki entry so the next person to come a long can have an easier time

[04:36:21] <MacGyver> aruhier: How do you know what IPv6 address it *should* have?

[04:36:37] <TheDcoder> MacGyver: Good to know, unfortunately I am stuck with Nvidia
[04:36:47] <aruhier> well, ipv6 in RA is consistant, it's derivated from the macaddress

[04:43:41] <MacGyver> (Which turns into a broadcast on the ethernet level but that's not really relevant)
[04:43:46] <aruhier> yep
[04:43:53] <MacGyver> The key point is that IPv6 has a mechanism for this *on the network layer*.
[04:43:59] <MacGyver> Whereas IPv4... doesn't.
[04:44:03] <TheDcoder> very cool
[04:44:08] <MacGyver> Or at least not a mandatory one.

[04:50:36] <aruhier> it's honestly easier a lot of the time
[04:50:40] <TheDcoder> There is a difference though, as the other end of the network can tell the difference between each client
[04:50:51] <urawotlol> they can do that any way
[04:50:54] <MacGyver> Right. Sure. Hence the privacy addresses.
[04:51:09] <MacGyver> I agree that that *should* be implemented properly.
[04:51:15] <TheDcoder> Yes
[04:51:20] <TheDcoder> urawotlol: How?
[04:51:31] <MacGyver> But then again.
[04:51:31] <jkc> TheDcoder: They can do that anyway. NAT is not a security or privacy measure. It's an address conservation measure, and nothing more.
[04:51:41] <MacGyver> K-anonimity is nice and all, but K is 1 to 2 on average.

[04:52:37] <MacGyver> (Though yeah, they can still look at the prefix for the exact same result)

[04:53:08] <MacGyver> TheDcoder: The main concern with IPv6 privacy is when your device moves to another prefix.
[04:53:11] <aruhier> not that much, you can consider the /64 to get a base of the router IP behind which the client is
[04:53:15] <MacGyver> *Then* you could be tracked based on the host-part.
[04:53:32] <TheDcoder> I agree that CGNAT is the worst, my ISP has one, I can't even port-forward to the internet
[04:53:34] <aruhier> and then, for your privacy issue, there is a lot of other metadata that tracks you fine without the IP
[04:53:45] <MacGyver> But that's solved with privacy addresses so *shrug*.

[04:56:31] <MacGyver> My suggestion is mostly to be *able* to debug what's happening.
[04:56:37] <jkc> TheDcoder: Your response indicates that you don't get the point. It takes twice the effort to brute force a 9-bit key as an 8-bit key, but the difference is meaningless in practice, which is why the statement "NAT is not a privacy measure" is involved.
[04:56:39] <MacGyver> It's not a solution to always use that link-local.

[04:59:28] <urawotlol> certs never expire if you dont move forward thru time
[04:59:30] <aruhier> to be fair, it's 7y old :p
[04:59:41] <kulak> is there a non-root user I can run rclone (backup app) on my machine?  In the past when I run as normal user access permissions were a problem.
[04:59:43] <MacGyver> Doesn't make it less funny :P
[04:59:54] <urawotlol> ^^
[04:59:56] <MacGyver> kulak: Not really, no.
[05:00:02] <kulak> ok
[05:00:06] <gumbo> my shell is so ugly 0_o
[05:00:08] <MacGyver> kulak: Any particular reason why you want to backup root-owned files without being root?
[05:00:15] <TheDcoder> kulak: I use rclone as a normal user, it's not really any different than a normal tool like cp or rsync
[05:00:31] <urawotlol> exept when you get to files which can be only read by root
[05:00:45] <MacGyver> kulak: You can definitely run rclone as a normal user, but then you can only backup files that that user has access to.
[05:00:49] <kulak> I think the main problem was that some files ended up without other user access and this resulted in errors.

[05:08:57] <TheDcoder> kulak: Zsh with the grml config
[05:09:03] <gumbo> thanks TheDcoder i will look up fish. my bash prompt is just plain i hate looking at it
[05:09:04] <Ghosthree3> TheDcoder: grml config + autosuggestions, substring search and syntax highlighting is basically fish but (99%) posix compatible without a very stupid syntax. so all the good features fish offers but you can paste commands without translating and just go off of bash instructions generally

[05:10:33] <TheDcoder> but I'll give it a try
[05:10:34] <gumbo> TheDcoder: like globs and stuff
[05:10:37] <kulak> well, I am user of fish myself, but I find that I am uncomfortable with its more advanced usage.  It is probably related to POSIX non-compliance.
[05:10:45] <TheDcoder> gumbo: yes of course, it's a shell

[05:10:52] <gumbo> ok thanks
[05:11:15] <Ghosthree3> fish had a moment when it was cool because it had cool features, but zsh has those now so there's no point in not being posix compliant except to make things more difficult for yourself day to day imo

[11:11:49] <tbreslein> hm, weird. could still be a pipewire problem since who knows which pipewire plugin telegram tries to use and maybe that is what is creating the issue. maybe you could install audio mixers (just terminal ones to test this real quick) for both interfaces and then check if those work
[11:12:09] <tbreslein> for the alsa interface you could use amixer, and I think a good pulse one would be pavucontrol

[18:03:56] <jbg> the main concern is to have them as close to the users as possible, but they don't use much resources. so we deploy in almost every cloud region across multiple clouds. at the moment we use the second-smallest instance type, but we could use the smallest if we can get the image size down a bit

[18:22:35] <bjorger> I don't want xorg to freeze up ever
[18:22:38] <bjorger> i use i3
[18:22:42] <Earnestly> lighttpd is also fairly grand, btw

[18:22:58] <jelle> bjorger: check dmesg?
[18:23:14] <BrainDamage> I think the main thing is that it's a static website
[18:23:24] <Earnestly> I made greyhttpd wrapper so that I can use lighttpd as darkhttpd, but with cgi and features
[18:23:34] <BrainDamage> so all caching works with you, rather than against you
