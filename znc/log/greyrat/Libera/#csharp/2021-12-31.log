[01:04:07] <Slade> eyes are bloodshot tho, so i'm guessing i'm sick
[01:04:17] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, my understanding is that DDR5 is being bought up and scaled like GPUs
[01:05:01] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Ah meh, sucks. Just checked the price for a 3080 .. it's 1600 EUR
[01:05:53] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, yup, the wife and I are running 1660s and I want to build a dedicated gaming rig for my living room soon :/
[01:06:32] <MatthiasVance> I have resorted to 3080 RTX in the cloud :p
[01:06:32] <Slade> sounds like you need an extra 150k like MatthiasVance
[01:06:43] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Yeah a bad time for that for sure :D
[01:06:48] <MatthiasVance> Slade: haha, but where would I live? ;p

[01:07:19] <MatthiasVance> xD
[01:07:32] <MatthiasVance> I would really like to buy a MBP
[01:07:35] <MatthiasVance> M1 Max or whatever
[01:07:41] <MatthiasVance> And use that instead of my desktop
[01:07:41] <DevJohnC> they are nice
[01:07:53] <Slade> i need to get a mac, i think
[01:07:58] <Slade> m1 sounds correct
[01:08:45] <DevJohnC> there are whispers of an m1 mac pro or w/e they call the big mac machines
[01:09:08] <MatthiasVance> ah yeah, starting at 8000 EUR
[01:09:19] <MatthiasVance> (or whatever that last model was)
[01:09:25] <DevJohnC> if they release one I need to talk work into some extra cash to invest in one because doing dev on a mini sucks
[01:09:33] <JakeSays> Slade: why are you going to the dark side?
[01:09:53] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Ah yeah mini is good for non-compiled languages maybe
[01:09:55] <DevJohnC> either that or a decent spec MBP and just thunderbolt it lol
[01:10:19] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, they just don't give them enough RAM!
[01:10:22] <Slade> JakeSays, need to compile for ios

[01:13:11] <Slade> only if you want 1.2ghz of bandwidth
[01:13:23] <JakeSays> i dooooo
[01:13:43] <brianonymous> only problem is i only got like 2 wifi 6 capable devices
[01:14:13] <JakeSays> hmm. wonder if my new phone is capable
[01:14:13] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: If they gave them enough RAM you wouldn't need to buy a more expensive machine... :P
[01:14:41] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, I suspect it's a limitation of the early M1 chips
[01:14:42] <JakeSays> Slade: if you just want to compile you could set up a virtual hackintosh
[01:14:50] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, the MBPs have more RAM
[01:15:07] <MatthiasVance> I think it's a marketing thing?
[01:15:09] <Slade> JakeSays, not super in love with this xps13. its actually the worst machine i've owned

[01:18:37] <JakeSays> might have been worth the $1k
[01:22:21] <MatthiasVance> Yeah, fuck, when did we ever think we'd pay that .. for a phone
[01:22:25] <Slade> JakeSays, wifi 6 != wifi 6e
[01:22:29] <MatthiasVance> But it's of course not just a phone anymore
[01:22:47] <JakeSays> Slade: close enough
[01:23:04] <MatthiasVance> wifi 6 ethernet, so you can plug in a cable to get faster wifi

[01:24:08] <DevJohnC> I've been considering getting one of those
[01:24:34] <JakeSays> it's really nice. my only complaint is the glass back
[01:25:44] <DevJohnC> too slippy slidey?
[01:26:13] <JakeSays> a little, but mostly glass adds zero value
[01:26:41] <JakeSays> Slade: i'm allergic to y

[01:37:38] <Nasp> Asus Router
[01:37:59] <JakeSays> ah

[12:39:37] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[12:39:55] <MatthiasVance> The last one before was 4 hours earlier than that yeah
[12:39:56] <_genuser_> and of course, blez is joining and quitting after every message we type.
[12:40:05] <MatthiasVance> I have that all filtered out
[12:40:12] <_genuser_> my buffer shows nothing above that.
[12:40:30] <_genuser_> and I joined the channel on 29th.
[12:40:37] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Not much, I fall into the same trap every time. Instead of thinking about line of business applications that have a start -> finish (or somewhat) I think about meta ideas .. like "provide easy API integrations"
[12:40:42] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: There has been way more
[12:41:22] <_genuser_> I'm just assuming since I wasn't focused on the channel, the web app for thelounge just didn't post those messages, to save memory consumption, etc. etc.
[12:41:32] <MatthiasVance> That could be

[12:42:03] <_genuser_> so how you wrapping up the year so far?
[12:42:50] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Switched jobs this month, busy with house renovation plans, doing pretty well overall ! How about you?
[12:42:56] <_genuser_> so you sign up for irccloud? strike 1! And then it's also a web app? strike 2!
[12:43:07] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Also a mobile app
[12:43:33] <MatthiasVance> I use the desktop client which is web-based probably which works fine
[12:43:34] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance congratulations on all fronts! I'm looking at changing jobs. I like my current job, but I know we'll be going to hybrid model starting next year sometime. And I'm not wanting to have to go in to an office again.
[12:43:58] <MatthiasVance> I totally get that!

[12:44:13] <_genuser_> had one guy say he was ready to make an offer, but he wanted me to go in 1 every two weeks. So twice a month.

[12:48:03] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Yeah if you're looking for fully remote and settle for 1 day every X it might be "ugh, should have gone for full remote"

[12:48:31] <MatthiasVance> I went from fully remote to office because I missed some things but that's also because doing full remote in covid times is wayy different
[12:48:37] <MatthiasVance> Now I'm back to full remote :)
[12:48:48] *** Joins: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96)
[12:48:50] <_genuser_> right, also I know the CPO wanted even more days, 2x per week. And I figured eventually he might overrule the big boss by saying he had a legitimate reason to have the entire team there.

[12:49:11] *** Joins: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96)
[12:49:47] <_genuser_> right, I did full remote for a long time. then I went to an onsite job. and it was like because it was more social. But also I was starting to notice the drive times, etc. etc. Having to get up early. Getting home late. And after covid, I figured now that I have done a/b testing, I prefer full remote.

[12:52:11] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance reading up on NFT craze also. Staking, Farming, Pooling, etc. etc.
[12:52:40] <MatthiasVance> meh
[12:53:01] <_genuser_> and other cryptos too.
[12:53:10] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Why btw?
[12:53:23] <MatthiasVance> Was doing some work for a DAG currency
[12:53:34] <_genuser_> whenever there's a new thing, people making money fast!
[12:53:39] <MatthiasVance> Yes and no
[12:53:46] <_genuser_> these NFTs were totally useless, and then they blew up.
[12:53:54] *** Joins: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96)
[12:54:24] <_genuser_> I mean there was a time, youtube ads were starting. But people who jumped in first and fast and stayed consistent made good money (still do). TikTok create a bunch of millionaire kids. Instagram, etc. etc.
[12:54:25] *** Quits: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:54:27] <_genuser_> Cryptos too.
[12:54:35] <MatthiasVance> True
[12:54:38] <_genuser_> Look at the NFTs selling for 3.4million dollars!
[12:54:52] <_genuser_> I mean, geez, for crying out loud! An NFT is selling for 3.4 million USD!
[12:55:15] <MatthiasVance> I see that as people with money making more money :D
[12:55:27] <_genuser_> then there's The Sandbox. So Snoopdog buys a bunch of land in The Sandbox. Immediately somebody pays 400k to buy some adjacent land in the game. To be snoop's neighbor.
[12:55:47] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance you really need money to buy NFTs at that level.
[12:56:01] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I see what you mean, but to me that's still in the category "useless". I made up my mind about that this week :D
[12:56:16] *** Joins: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96)
[12:56:33] <_genuser_> I grade that at two levels - technical usefulness, and opportunity usefullness.
[12:56:33] *** Quits: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:56:37] <MatthiasVance> agreed
[12:56:41] <MatthiasVance> I do the same :D
[12:56:54] <_genuser_> if you can use the opportunity to make money and it helps you retire (or afford your favorite toys), then it's useful at that level.
[12:57:24] <_genuser_> on the other hand, if you're saying oh look at this, this NFTs proves that you own xyz and there really is no use for actually owning that xyz, then that's a whole other level of usefulness.
[12:57:26] <MatthiasVance> My friend is now a millionaire .. I turned down spending EUR 50 / month for a server because this is the one time I listened to my wife (We were in the middle of buying / renovating a house)
[12:57:44] <MatthiasVance> Never listening to my wife again :D
[12:58:27] <_genuser_> in case the The Sandbox (or Decentraland Or Axie), the NFTs actually serve a purpose. They verify your claim to the land in-game. BUT, ..... since the game is run by a centralized authority (the game vendor), it could have used the old school stuff too. Second Life and all also had item ownersihp and didn't need NFTs.

[13:01:33] <_genuser_> well well, the wife certainly deserves a lecture. hehe.
[13:01:50] <_genuser_> but you know it's the same anywhere. I was mining bitcoin when it was 900.
[13:01:54] <_genuser_> I could have just bought it.
[13:02:02] <MatthiasVance> Yes :P
[13:02:15] <_genuser_> It also dropped to 200 at some point. I could have bought it. But I was like pfft, spend real money on this? I'm not convinced.
[13:02:15] <MatthiasVance> Remember those bitcoin faucets in the early days? That means I got 5 BTC!!
[13:02:22] <MatthiasVance> But who cares about a coin that's worth .. nothing..
[13:02:28] <MatthiasVance> Indeed! :D
[13:02:29] <_genuser_> I am _now_ convinced. But now the price is 47,000 USD per coin.
[13:02:41] <_genuser_> oh right. I remember those faucets.

[13:21:21] <_genuser_> I'm reading up on pancakeswap, uniswap, sushiswap, so far. To see what each one does.
[13:21:34] <_genuser_> I have already read enough on reddit about providing liquidity on uniswap to know that I don't wish to try that.
[13:21:54] <_genuser_> and apparently impermanent loss is a big thing in many pairs that people provide liquidity for.
[13:22:24] <_genuser_> I'm guessing liquidity Providing for most pairs will be like that on all platforms. Because impermanent loss isn't uniswap specific. That's just your coins.

[20:56:45] <bomb> did you try turning it off and on again?
[20:57:40] <Shariff> bomb: was that for me?
[20:58:00] <bomb> yes, sorry, I was being smartass due to new year eve
[20:58:02] <bomb> happy new year, btw :)
[20:58:07] <Shariff> You too!!
[20:58:15] <Shariff> And yes, I reboot my system
[20:58:19] <Shariff> No change
[20:58:43] <Slade> <jonp> i'm on macOS; ellipsis is option+;  <-- oh, fancy!
[20:58:47] <bomb> hmm
[20:59:25] <Shariff> From the examples "Microsoft" and "System" it seemed like it references packages.. but I guess not
[21:06:45] *** jonp is now known as Guest78

[21:24:14] <Shariff> Looks great... at 2:50 I thought it was demonstrated by Bud Spencer :)
[21:26:08] <bomb> heh
[21:26:27] <ern> Hmm, if you are going to stab someone you need a knife with those protectors
[21:26:52] <ern> That knife is dangerous
[21:27:54] <bomb> I need two of them, so I can double-stab my enemy
[21:28:16] <ern> The idea is stab - twist
[21:28:47] <bomb> amateur stuff
[21:29:15] <bomb> stab -> rip

[21:31:35] <ern> bomb: That's an amazing knife, cutting trought he ribs and all
[21:33:20] <ern> I know a guy who stabbed people as a profession
[21:33:30] <ern> Well, kind of his job
[21:33:40] <bomb> surgeon?
[21:34:49] <ern> No, gangster.
[21:35:18] <bomb> okay
[21:35:22] <bomb> what about him?
[21:35:57] <ern> Stabbing is not as easy as it seems.
[21:37:02] <bomb> it's easy
[21:37:11] <bomb> unless you hit his skull or something :D
[21:38:02] <ern> He got stabbed once when we were having a beer at a pub
[21:38:31] <ern> some "unhappy business aquintence" came and ... stabbed him
[21:43:49] <viaSanctus>  i'm getting a warning on a fire and forget method call...
[21:44:04] <viaSanctus> can i simply ignore it?
[21:44:24] <bomb> ern you should pick your friends carefully
[21:44:33] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83)
[21:45:17] <bomb> what if the attacker stabbed you too?
[21:45:42] <bomb> that shit won't heal quickly, if ever.
[21:46:00] * viaSanctus found discard
[21:48:03] <ern> bomb: Then i'd be in jail for manslaughter.
[21:48:14] <ern> (you are not allowed to kill atackers in Sweden)
[21:48:47] <bomb> uhh that's weird
[21:49:02] <bomb> what if it takes killing to mitigate an attack?
[21:49:18] <ern> Most likely you will not end up in jail then
[21:49:35] <ern> But I would jump on the guys head until the end.
[21:49:41] <ern> Like a pogo stick
[21:49:47] <ern> because, you do not simply threaten me.
[21:49:58] <ern> That's where I draw the line.
[21:50:25] <ern> That would most likely count as "too much" in a court.
[21:51:02] <ern> However, I'm usually good at detecting such situations/people and walk away before anything even starts.
[21:55:53] <bpmedley> https://github.com/brianmed/SocketFun/blob/main/socketwait/WaitFor.cs  <-- Here is the latest version of the most retry logic for my socketwait utility.  Polly really helped with code cleanup, imo!!
[22:09:48] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: Now delete half that file and it will be cleaned up even more!
[22:11:26] <MatthiasVance> Not kidding I think half can be removed
[22:12:57] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : Which parts?
[22:13:09] <bpmedley> I appreciate the input!
[22:17:08] *** Quits: SlimmyJimmy (blank@136.37.25.140) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[22:17:37] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: Well I think the most important part (not code removal) is the naming. I find it hard to follow along. "IsExitStatusZeroAsync" is supposed to return bool, but it calls "ExitStatusIsZero" (which is also confusingly something that returns a bool)
[22:18:32] <MatthiasVance> And "ExitStatusZeroWhen " is bugging me
[22:19:16] <bpmedley> That aspect is confusing.  The shell uses zero for successful program execution.  And, the console app can return success on either a failed ping or successful ping (as specific examples).
[22:19:23] <MatthiasVance> I teach people to start naming things from the right side first. So: "Request" -> what kind -> "HttpRequest"
[22:19:38] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: I'm not talking about what your code *does*, only how it *reads* :D
[22:20:08] <bpmedley> Makes sense.  I was thinking of renaming ExitStatusZeroWhen to ExitStatusCondition
[22:20:40] <bpmedley> I agree that even though this version is better there could be more clarity.
[22:21:37] <MatthiasVance> ExitStatusCondition -> yeah much better
[22:22:39] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: Do you have tests in that project?
[22:23:02] <MatthiasVance> Ah it's a command line utility
[22:23:04] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : https://github.com/brianmed/SocketFun/blob/main/socketwait/FunctionalTesting.md  <-- All functional.  I'm thinking of a way I can automate.
[22:23:30] <bpmedley> Usually takes 1.5 hours or so for testing.
[22:24:43] <MatthiasVance> If you want automated tests you have to make sure you have your business logic separate from your I/O
[22:24:48] <MatthiasVance> *unit tests
[22:25:22] <MatthiasVance> Very interesting utility btw, especially for ops stuff
[22:26:22] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : Thank you!!  Should be cross-platform, as well.  Did you see the script in the README that reboots a Linux box and waits for SSH to respond?
[22:26:38] <MatthiasVance> Yeah that's when I thought "oh this is handy!" :D
[22:26:51] <bpmedley> I agree on the unit tests.  I should refactor further so I can more easily use xUnit.  Thanks.
[22:26:52] <MatthiasVance> I remember back in the days when I managed more things myself I would loved it haha
[22:27:16] <MatthiasVance> I'm forking the project to please my mind with refactoring it  and seeing if I actually end up with something different or if it could be considered "goldplating"
[22:27:33] <bpmedley> goldplating?
[22:27:44] <MatthiasVance> Ehh, making things shiny for the purpose of making things shiny
[22:27:52] <MatthiasVance> Instead of clarity or readability
[22:28:12] <MatthiasVance> "In time management, gold plating is the phenomenon of working on a project or task past the point of diminishing returns." (from wikipedia)
[22:28:22] <bpmedley> I see
[22:28:30] <bpmedley> Thanks for your interest!!

[22:54:48] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : You have a point.  I'll consider removing.  Might take up too much screen space.  Does injecting ILogger,<T> work well with Serilog?
[22:55:10] <MatthiasVance> Yes! All major logging libs have support for ILogger<T>
