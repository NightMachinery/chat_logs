[15:11:39] <podeni> Hi everyone. I have a CSV with multiline-cells that I want to collapse, so that it's one record / line. All cells are quoted, so a multiline cell is identifiable in that the newline that breaks the cell doesn't have a quote either to the right or to the left. So in terms of regex I'm thinking something like replace [^"]\n[^"] with $1 $2?
[15:13:14] <LeoNerd> I wouldn't use a regexp for that
[15:13:19] <LeoNerd> I'd read it then write it again with Text::CSV
[15:13:28] <LeoNerd> You can give it options to control how it does things like quoting
[15:14:55] <ilmari> hethw: again: please show actual, full, running code, and output thereof
[15:15:26] <podeni> It's output from mysqldump, don't have much control over the output.
[15:15:47] <LeoNerd> Yes that's my point - read it then write it again, so you -can- control how that is being written
[15:16:49] <podeni> I see, so parse the whole file. Got it.

[21:33:43] <pragma-> Hm. I wonder if I can use 200e instead of 200b to act as an invisible character inserted into nicknames to prevent irc clients from highlighting the owners of said nicknames. An awful lot of terminals render 200b as a normal space when it should be a zero-width invisible space. 
[21:35:08] <pragma-> Feh, I'll stick with 200b and wait for the terminals to fix themselves.
[21:35:34] <Grinnz> U+FEFF is usually used for things like that
[21:35:46] <Grinnz> it's intentionally zero-width and non-breaking

[21:38:04] <pragma-> Hopefully those terminals support that one at least.
[21:42:08] <pragma-> Nope, still shows up as a visible space on those newer terminals that don't yet fully support Unicode (Windows Terminal, etc).

[21:49:27] <Grinnz> xenu: this guy is conflating unicode with character encodings terribly
[21:49:49] <pragma-> Curious. Check this out. When I use U+200b, my usual terminal puts a U+200b byte in the text. When I copy the text, the byte is copied along with it. But when I use U+feff, my terminal seems to simply strip the character. I can copy the text and its normal text without the bytes for U+feff present.
[21:50:15] <LeoNerd> Yup, that sounds expected
[21:50:23] <Grinnz> i also lol'd at his solution that we should force everyone in the world to speak a language that fits in 8 bits

[21:50:51] <LeoNerd> ISO-8859-15 is rubbish, anyway. It can't represent Esperanto, so no hope of getting all the world to use one language
[21:51:18] <Grinnz> pragma-: yeah some have exceptions so that character doesn't get copied
[21:51:20] <xenu> yeah ios-8859-15 is an interesting choice, i believe it never was a mainstream encoding

[22:57:54] <gordonfish> Um, seriously? The shiney new terminal app from redmond doesn't have unicode support? I'm honestly both shocked and not surprised at the same time... I mean I can understand cmd.exe and PS (which essentially ran ontop of a cmd.exe window) having poor unicode support (even with CHCP 65001), but Windows Terminal is supposed to be modern (both in design and a "modern ui"/metro app...), so I'm not sure what excuse there is...

[23:07:32] <pragma-> there are also a few linux terminals that render the family of zero-width spaces as visible plain spaces
[23:07:45] <pragma-> I forget which ones specifically
[23:18:52] <gordonfish> pragma-: That may be, though there ar many different ones to choose from there, and they can be patched by users, where as Windows has one (or two with Windows Terminal along with cmd.exe/PS) that is built in and any third party ones, like Conemu, are just wrappers around cmd.exe
[23:19:40] <xenu> that's not true anymore
[23:19:50] <xenu> they added ptys to windows
[23:19:56] <xenu> the new terminal is implemented using that mechanism
[23:20:44] <gordonfish> xenu: That is nice to see. Still can't easily change the general behavior / patch thing though, but that's par for the course for Windows land.
[23:21:03] <xenu> you can implement a new terminal, there's an api for that
[23:21:05] <gordonfish> s/thing\K/s/
[23:21:22] <xenu> for example the ssh client i'm using (securecrt) can also work as a terminal 
[23:21:33] <xenu> it uses that conpty api
[23:23:01] <gordonfish> xenu: Again that is nice. One problem I have seen is that Windows Terminal refuses to install/run on some versions of Windows 10 that I've seen, even newer ones (which I presume is needed to get the newer pty stuff, unless that is Win 11 only) so it feels like MS still hasn't learned from the IE days of making a application overly integrated instead of a simpler program that just runs - I mean what else does a program really need to do?
[23:23:23] <zgu> wouldn't securelcd use a lot less power and not have burn-in issues?
[23:23:39] <gordonfish> (And as such you can't use it with previous windows versions.)
[23:23:46] <xenu> it was introduced in win10 1809 or 1903, i'm not sure
[23:23:55] <xenu> er
[23:23:58] <xenu> 1809 or 1803
[23:24:08] <gordonfish> Not built in, it was something that needed to be installed
[23:24:25] <xenu> i'm talking about the api, the mechanism that allows you to implement new terminals
[23:24:48] <xenu> you are complaining about them not having a time machine
[23:25:31] <gordonfish> Was that actually built in? If so, why is it (Windows Terminal) so picky about where it could be installed? And this was on 1809 and 19xx systems I remember running into such problems.
