[00:00:18] <m17h> BTC will ultimately have to undergo a fundamental change eventually to get through that but that won't happen til 2140 or so

[00:01:18] <linux_dream> so its price mostly comes down to how much people are willing to pay for a BTC.    out of the 21 millions, there will be less and less avaiable
[00:01:55] <linux_dream> because people die, or lose their seed, etc.  so over time the number of aviabable BTC will diminish (it's probably already going down), making it scarcer
[00:02:23] <Aut0Exec> k
[00:02:44] <linux_dream> to give you an overview of what will happen in 2100 - 2130
[00:02:57] <linux_dream> only a single BTC will be mined then, over that period of time
[00:03:22] <linux_dream> people will spend their hardware on getting a fraction of a BTC insanely small compared to what we're used today
[00:03:44] <entropy2> https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-inflation/
[00:03:46] <linux_dream> today a block gives 6.25 or 12 BTC, I forgot.  doesn't matter much
[00:03:50] <BUSY> 6
[00:03:58] <linux_dream> 6 BTC every 10 minutes
[00:04:09] <linux_dream> in 2100 it will be 1 BTC in 30 years
[00:04:39] <linux_dream> so, even if you don't have faith in BTC, it might be wise to just get a dust of it, and pass it to your children, and so on
[00:04:45] <entropy2> yeah probably less money will be spent on hardware to mine bitcoin at that point.
[00:05:11] <linux_dream> not really, it would mean average Joes would get the dust reward
[00:05:17] <linux_dream> which may be very valuable
[00:06:18] <BUSY> 900 new BTC mined every day today, in just 2 decades that number is only 30
[00:06:34] <testusr> Aut0Exec: I suggest to take a look at the official Bitcoin website, there you can choose a Wallet that fits your needs.
[00:07:46] <bugs_> nation states will compete for those remaining satoshis
[00:07:51] <entropy2> Lets say bitcoin's market cap is 400 trillion in 2100. That would mean that 1 bitcoin would be worth $19 million in 2021 dollars. Mining would be a small industry indeed at that point. At least from block rewards.

[00:08:38] <testusr> Btw, I find really valuable options that don't require KYC... but the probability of finding SCAM is sadly bigger.
[00:11:14] <testusr> m17h: I also think the the price will increase in the long term, but is really difficult to understand how much of the 'value' (or Price) is due to speculation/FOMO/... and how much is actual value. Now that crypto-trading is viral, is even harder to tell
[00:12:32] <BUSY> what's the difference really?  gold holds monetary premium but still full of speculation - the value is what the bid/ask market reveals
[00:15:03] <entropy2> Maybe actual value is in real estate, assets like gold and bitcoin are stepping stones.
[00:15:25] <testusr> entropy: Hal Finney once wrote the same thing, proposing a 'thought experiment', asking what the value would be once BTC become the main currency on earth. So he simply calculated 'total wealth on earth' (roughly) / 21MLN :)
[00:16:01] <entropy2> testusr Yes! I recently found that post on sourceforge!

[00:24:34] <testusr> But how many people are looking at it as an asset and how many as an actual currency and are ok in using it to buy/trade stuff? How many are only interested in having a 10x on their portfolio to reconvert in USD? And what are the implications of it?
[00:25:28] <entropy2> testusr 10x might not be realistic at this point, at least not over the next couple of years.

[05:25:12] <scamartist> Gladstein started PHISHING for Bitcoin donations in 2019, to distrupt the finances of https://humanrights.foundation/donate-bitcoin.html he did so because since 2015 the so called "HRF" attacked Zoltan Konder with fraudulent US and EU trademark applications. They bullied Zoltan and until this day they bully Zoltan Konder the founder of another Human Rights Foundation because the HRF want to steal the humanrights.foundation domain name.

[09:52:50] <CoJaBo> this matters why?
[09:53:41] <bitcoinorg> Because I donated 0.3 Bitcoin and wondering where is the money
[09:54:56] <CoJaBo> Probably in some wallet owned by the recipient?
[09:55:49] <bitcoinorg> I don't think so that Cobra has that anymore.
[09:56:16] <CoJaBo> If they're registered as a charity, see if they publish expense reports or whatnot
[09:56:38] <bitcoinorg> bitcoin.org is not registered anywhere
[09:57:12] <bitcoinorg> it is run by theymos previously and now run by Cobra (probably the same person in my opinion)
[09:57:33] <specing> So
[09:57:36] <CoJaBo> If that's the case, the donation is a gift and you probably will never know if, when, or what they spend it on
[09:57:49] <bitcoinorg> lol
[09:57:50] <specing> you donated 0.3 btc back when it was worth almost nothing and now you are feeling remorse?
[09:58:05] <bitcoinorg> 10.000 is not nothing

[09:58:41] <bitcoinorg> yeah
[09:58:56] <specing> why did you donate so much
[09:59:02] <specing> if it hurts you so much
[09:59:04] <bitcoinorg> so bitcoin.org is a scam isn't it?
[09:59:09] <specing> you are a scam
[09:59:17] <bitcoinorg> how so?
[09:59:26] <bitcoinorg> I'm the scam?
[09:59:55] <CoJaBo> You gave them money and that makes them a scam because they won't tell you how they might spend it? Wat.
[10:00:08] <bitcoinorg> CoJaBo said "the donation is a gift and you probably will never know if, when, or what they spend it on"
[10:00:35] <bitcoinorg> so if I received 40 Bitcoin why the fuck you calling me a scammer?
[10:01:02] <CoJaBo> I'd say if you recieved 40 bitcoin, you will have received 40 bitcoin
[10:01:17] <bitcoinorg> actually that is correct
[10:01:35] <bitcoinorg> I and my organization did received more than 40 Bitcoin as donation.
[10:02:24] <bitcoinorg> the difference is that my organizations has significant costs to pay, not hosted on GitHub like bitcoin.org

Now let's allow anyone to write Smartâ„¢ Contracts and mint whatever the f*** they want on i
[14:38:30] <Victorsueca> t (disclaimer: Smartâ„¢ is only a brand name, contracts may actually be dumb) to flip it into the market later or do an IPO or whatever, while we charge fees for everything.

[14:43:13] <Victorsueca> capuchino_: last time I checked the Namecoin blockchain was very messed up due to a major namecoin domain provider losing all their keys somehow, besides, good luck having someone download a special browser or configuring a custom proxy/dns just to resolve those.
[14:43:39] <capuchino_> lol
[14:43:47] <capuchino_> they lost they keys
[14:43:49] <capuchino_> not mine

[14:48:47] <buZz> there is ##altcoins, fyi
[14:48:48] <capuchino_> maybe a bit more
[14:48:52] <buZz> this is #bitcoin

[14:56:31] <capuchino> but yeah

[14:59:20] <AndyS2_> capuchino: I don't work in this industry, this is a technical hobby
[14:59:28] <Victorsueca> capuchino: L-BTC is backed by actual Bitcoin that are locked in when exchanged. Having L-BTC entitles you to an actual amount of actual Bitcoin and no one can create them out of thin air. If you don't believe me, you can go ahead, sync the blockchain and verify it by yourself, I'll be waiting.
[14:59:44] <buZz> i like that owning a Tesla makes you about 10-20% more likely to crash into something

[19:18:58] <s17> lol at that mako recommendation earlier, "The entire wallet RPC is currently missing, along with the wallet itself."
[19:19:02] <NetSysFire> so we have this wiki page about bitcoin in the archwiki (you should all know the addr, no url as per rules) and i am unsure what to do with it because it seems outdated. is it really that bad? what do you think? cc sudoforge
[19:22:58] <sudoforge> i'll give it a look-see in about an hour
[19:23:10] <sudoforge> NetSysFire: i need to step away for a bit
[19:24:39] *** Joins: jamesecombs (~james@47.203.171.152)
[19:25:03] <NetSysFire> its fine
[19:25:50] <NetSysFire> theres also a couple of dead links and i dont even know if they are relevant or even malicious
[19:26:29] <sudoforge> NetSysFire: but to summarize my thoughts from scanning over it: the information isn't really incorrect, it just seems outdated
[19:26:39] <NetSysFire> ah, thats good to know
[19:28:26] <NetSysFire> funny enough, because of spam similar to the one currently going on, the page is protected and can only be edited from folks in the archwiki maintenance team (which includes me)
[19:29:49] <moo> do you need details about bitcoin protocol, consensus etc that can become outdated, vs just how to install it and configure on arch?
[19:30:00] *** Quits: jamesecombs (~james@47.203.171.152) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:30:47] <moo> also "There are several Bitcoin thin client implementations in the official repositories and in the AUR." links to what is aur and what are official repos, instead it'd be nicer to actually list what wallets are and how to install
[19:30:52] <NetSysFire> thats the question. i would drastically reduce the content and replace it with links to your wiki and keep it arch-relevant, such as a list of software available on arch and tweaks for it, or maybe general tips and lists of links
[19:30:59] <sudoforge> NetSysFire: moo: great question, i was actually just thinking about what sort of approach we want to take
[19:31:24] <sudoforge> NetSysFire: IMO that's what we should be doing. i don't think it makes sense to provide an overview of the bitcoin ecosystem in our wiki
[19:31:32] <NetSysFire> yeah
[19:32:00] <sudoforge> See also: Bitcoin Wiki
[19:32:03] <sudoforge> :)
[19:32:04] <moo> if i wanted to just get into bitcoin on arch, perfect wiki entry would be quick overview (bitcoin is a crypto etc), and list of popular wallets available straight from aur etc
[19:32:11] <sudoforge> i mean, it's already listed there
[19:32:44] <moo> both wallets, various clients, mining apps etc
[19:32:53] <NetSysFire> i agree
[19:33:19] <moo> plus it has completely random information like the line about initial download
[19:33:26] <sudoforge> and consensus
[19:34:58] <NetSysFire> i have no idea about bitcoin, so its really hard for me to identify irrelevant information
[19:35:02] <sudoforge> i think, basically, rewriting it to provide the stuff moo mentioned and just make sure we emphasize with a warning panel that users should do additional research on the bitcoin wiki is a good way to provide useful information without increasing the cost of maintenance
[19:35:33] <moo> yeah basically focus on software side, not the math behind it:)
[19:35:51] <NetSysFire> i am really bad at math anyways, hah
[19:36:14] <sudoforge> although i'm not sure we need to provide a list of wallets or available packages. we don't tend to do this in other articles, except when talking about a specific approach to, say, disk encryption
[19:37:09] <sudoforge> anyway, i really need to go now, i'll be back in a bit
[19:37:23] <NetSysFire> i just removed the consensus section
