[04:18:53] <ButterNoodle> I mean if its a cheap tv... 
[04:19:11] <ButterNoodle> streamers as in netflix not onlyfans
[04:19:15] <Cryowolf> My neighbour? 
[04:19:27] <ButterNoodle> consumers not creators
[04:19:52] <Cryowolf> No he's a clinical psychopath, drug dealer, thief, murderer and unstable person deluxe
[04:20:09] <Cryowolf> not a streamer
[04:20:19] <Cryowolf> oh and he's a malignant narcissist
[04:20:26] <Cryowolf> which is a streamer quality
[04:20:41] <ButterNoodle> if kids live there.. leave some of those cheap toys that make a lot of noise
[04:20:53] <ButterNoodle> well
[04:21:09] <ButterNoodle> unfortunately that would lead to child abuse if the dood is a psycho
[04:21:11] <Cryowolf> I don't have kids. He does but he's not allowed to have them here
[04:21:32] <Cryowolf> his first daughter was doing drugs and having sex from age 12
[04:21:45] <bxgelsan> wtf
[04:21:46] <ButterNoodle> nice family...
[04:21:51] <bxgelsan> i tabbed over at the right moment.
[04:21:57] <Cryowolf> and he didn't care enough to do anything
[04:21:59] <bxgelsan> wrong*
[04:22:01] <Cryowolf> he told others to do something
[04:22:05] <Cryowolf> but he never did
[04:22:20] <ButterNoodle> yea.. we have those kinda people here
[04:22:39] <Cryowolf> his second daughter is a bundle of joy and thankfully she and her mother moved away
[04:22:40] <bxgelsan> ButterNoodle: if i could pm you with some info will you respond to me?
[04:22:45] <ButterNoodle> its troublesome to be a role model and parent

[04:23:40] <Cryowolf> you don't need to be parent of the year. Just don't snort cocaine while taking morphine and smoking pot. Then selling those drugs and having a gathering of criminals at home
[04:24:01] <bxgelsan> Cryowolf: hectic environment
[04:24:07] <bxgelsan> terrible for a child to develop in
[04:24:10] <Cryowolf> thankfully they'd moved away at this point but he has been robbed four times now, by people he antagonized. He has been shot at
[04:24:18] <Cryowolf> and he lives wall to wall with me
[04:24:26] <Fenderbassist> oh joy
[04:24:26] <Cryowolf> a bullet could easily go stray into my window
[04:25:14] <Cryowolf> if I was physically fit again but waiting on surgery so no....but if I was, I'd go over to him and tell him to turn the fucking volume down or I will drill through the wall and through his tv

[04:45:45] <Fenderbassist> and your hobbies
[04:46:15] <amigojapan> I see Fenderbassist . It does seem unavoidable unless tomako changes her mind

[10:02:38] <teus> On the basis of circumstantial evidence, fecal aerosol transmission may have caused the community outbreak of COVID-19 in this high-rise building.
[10:02:52] <teus> "The first thing you notice in a Chinese bathroom is the smell. It stinks. The main reason for this is that they do not install p-traps on their plumbing. Very surprising as a p-trap is inexpensive and the Chinese are fanatical about their health. We have been in 4 and 5 star hotels and they didn’t have p-traps either."

[12:33:05] <DunceCotus> the industrial destruction of cetaceans
[12:40:02] <emmeka> industrial probably isn't a good word to describe the whale hunt here.
[12:41:20] <emmeka> it's just a subsistence thing, the able men of the community go out, and whoever gets one or however many, it is distributed across the whole community equally.
[12:42:21] <DunceCotus> emmeka: hm okay
[12:42:37] <DunceCotus> I guess Japan is more industrial about it
[12:42:38] <DunceCotus> or was
[12:42:55] <DunceCotus> probably still blubberizing the baleens
[12:44:47] <emmeka> I still haven't tried whale meat :(
[12:44:52] <emmeka> I did eat seal, though
[12:45:13] <emmeka> which is a crime in the EU, and I do love doing things that are crimes according to the EU

[12:50:49] <emmeka> did you know seals are like komodo dragons, they have a bacterial toxin on their teeth that usually kills whatever they bite. in humans, it usually results in the necrosis of the hand or at least finger that was bitten.

[20:13:52] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, people grow up, espcially when they have a loved one who is affected by a thing they may have mocked before. Either way Chris Rock is a shit who told a lame joke and doubled down on said joke when he realized the butt of it didn't like it
[20:13:55] <ButterNoodle> I just know his wife keeps his cock'n ball in little box by the bed

[20:15:41] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, Chris Rock should have known better seeing as he was on a documentary about the importance of hair culture including  about Alopecia
[20:15:45] <Zoidberg> I was also thinking the same
[20:15:54] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: quite spicy, not sweet. All the customers of that restaurant are Chinese
[20:16:20] <ButterNoodle> S_T_A_N: rly? well ig people fake-care about stuff for clout and money?
[20:16:31] <Zoidberg> if it was so offensive joke, his wife would have said something ButterNoodle 
[20:16:46] <ButterNoodle> Zoidberg: did u see the look on her face?
[20:16:55] <Zoidberg> he could have just flipped off and done with it

[20:17:04] <ButterNoodle> Zoidberg: tru
[20:17:04] <S_T_A_N> Zoidberg, she reacted. And then Chris Rock when seeing her reaction kept going and made it worse
[20:17:11] <ButterNoodle> but
[20:17:28] <ButterNoodle> I would have waited and throat punched him off stage
[20:17:58] <ButterNoodle> *pull a jackass and shave a huge chunk off the side of his head
[20:18:42] <Zoidberg> that's a bit much
[20:18:51] <ButterNoodle> would have been a fresh prince moment if he held em down gave him a new hair do
[20:18:54] <ButterNoodle> well
[20:19:12] <ButterNoodle> shaving someones head in a rude way is better than direct violence imho
[20:19:23] <ButterNoodle> *no one has gone to jail over a haircut
[20:19:24] <S_T_A_N> what the fuck? No
[20:19:37] <Zoidberg> and now he has to go live with his uncle :p

[20:19:48] <ButterNoodle> tru

[20:20:33] <Zoidberg> :p
[20:20:34] <S_T_A_N> shaving someones head without concent is worse than a slap imo

[20:23:44] <ButterNoodle> S_T_A_N: yes thats what a haircut irl is worse than slapping him in the face

[20:48:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: never happened to me. Anydesk is even good at low latency

[23:58:27] <Nanobot> A terrible disaster has destroyed all clothes on Earth, except for underwear. People are now forced to live their lives wearing only underwear. Due to the fact that men wear half as much underwear as women at one time, 99% of all men freeze to death within the first few weeks. MC is one of the remaining men who have managed to keep their bodies warm by wearing women's underwear. Unfortunately, this makes them look indistinguishable from women. How will MC
