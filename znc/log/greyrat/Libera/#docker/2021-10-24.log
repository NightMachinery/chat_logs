[15:19:36] <finger> it's not something theoretical. I need it because I build a docker image that I than deploy onto ecs and I want the docker image at build time to output all the paths that the application supports so I can add them to ecs at deploy time

[15:25:24] <ikke> Guest3244: what's the exact error?
[15:25:33] <ikke> docker stores images centrally

[15:53:27] <Guest3244> I'm already confused by the docs. I didn't want to ask IRC such a simple question, but: how do I create a global config file in ~/.config/docker/ which says to run Docker with "--security-opt apparmor=docker-default" for all commands?
[15:54:25] <Guest3244> (I aliased "docker" to "sudo docker --security-opt apparmor=docker-default", but it errored out because it expects a command before flags)
[15:55:32] <artok> rather add youself to docker group 
[15:57:52] <Guest3244> artok: Just did. I already installed it via "sudo docker pull dyalog/dyalog", but I ran it again to see what would happen - it gave the same permissions error

[16:10:43] <riv> it's weird, there is something wrong with the logs maybe the way i set up docker
[16:11:08] <riv> tail isn't showing me anything, so I get a shell in my container and cat the log, but that shows nothing - if i type and hit enter it echos the line back at me
[16:11:19] <riv> im using this nginx container
[16:15:24] <artok> another way is to start sending logs to stdout and stderr and read them with docker logs
[16:15:44] <riv> i do see logs printed to stdout

[17:49:07] <fatalnix> Just playing around with docker a little. I pulled down the ubuntu image and played with it, I noticed that when I exit, and do say docker run -it ubuntu everything I did is gone, and apparently this is because it creates a new image, which is pretty cool. I noticed though, the large sum of data stored in my /var/lib/docker in overlay2 is still there, and I am having trouble trying to find out, how can I 
[17:49:13] <fatalnix> load this container and tell it to use "that particular overlay2 directory" ?

[17:54:52] <artok> containers are just for that, run stuff and then discard it. data is the persistent thing and you use volumes for that
[17:55:34] <fatalnix> okay, so I can create a volume and mount the volume itself, so then I guess I just need to find  a way to convert some existing overlay into a named volume and mount it from there.
