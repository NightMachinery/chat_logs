[19:04:02] <tarzeau> so what part of this sed is BRE? uptime|sed 's/ days\?,[[:space:]]\+/+/;s, averages\?:,,;s/ min//'
[19:04:18] <tarzeau> and how could i get it easily to work no only on linux with gnu sed, but also macos/freebsd sed?
[19:05:04] <emanuele6> tarzeau: "so what part of this sed is BRE?" what is that supposed to mean?
[19:05:14] <emanuele6> either way, \+ and \? are not portable
[19:05:38] <emanuele6> use \{1,\} and \{0,1\} instead
[19:05:51] <tarzeau> larryv said your sed script uses unnecessary BRE extensions but you don't mention that as a requirement, but i didn't understand looked up bre extension and found gnu sed page
[19:06:03] <emanuele6> BRE extensions
[19:06:07] <emanuele6> not just BRE
[19:06:28] <emanuele6> either way, there is no way that code can ever be portable
[19:06:40] <emanuele6> the output of uptime is not reliably parsable
[19:06:44] <tarzeau> ah right, sorry.. so l{1,\} would mean l or not l? or must be l\{0,1\}?
[19:07:07] <emanuele6> {1,\} means nothing
[19:07:08] <tarzeau> emanuele6: yes i figured it's horrible depending on what system one is :)
[19:07:52] <emanuele6> if you only want to know how to  make that sed script portable and only use standard BRE syntax, it is:
[19:08:01] <tarzeau> it's fine if it's good enough (for me, for linux/macOS/freebsd) - i will not write my own uptime program and just try to have it parsable good enough
[19:08:18] <tarzeau> ^ YES that is all i want :)
[19:08:32] <tarzeau> *drumroll*
[19:08:40] <emanuele6> sed 's/ days\{0,1\},[[:space:]]\{1,\}/+/; s/ averages\{0,1\}://; s/ min//'   ( i also replaced unnecessary comma with / )
[19:08:50] <emanuele6> but space there makes no sense
[19:09:02] <emanuele6> you probably want [[:blank:]] not [[:space:]]
[19:09:31] <emanuele6> > i will not write my own uptime program and just try to have it parsable good enough
[19:09:38] <emanuele6> uptime IS NOT parsable!
[19:09:59] <emanuele6> if the output format ever changes, your script will break.
[19:10:04] <tarzeau> ok thank you so very much
[19:10:19] <tarzeau> that is true :) but looking at the sources, it hardly ever changes, doesn't mean it can't ever, though
[19:10:51] <emanuele6> ...
