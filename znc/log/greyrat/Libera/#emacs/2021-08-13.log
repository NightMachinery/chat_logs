[00:45:17] <wasamasa> because if doing dap things doesn't add anything to the buffer, shackle can't do anything
[00:45:34] <bpalmer> lisp123: max-lisp-eval-depth or complaints about max-specpdl-size being exceeded are likely to happen if you have written large loops as recursive function calls.

[00:47:09] <ville> yes, doing something like C-h k did then result in it opening the *shackle trace* buffer. but yes it seems like dap-ui-locals, for example, is not doing whatever shackle is looking at as there's no output to the trace buffer

[00:48:49] <lisp123> bpalmer: Would 27 recursions be a lot for elisp to handle?

[00:50:45] <lisp123> bpalmer: Thanks. I have disabled, so will see if the errors persist (it was max-lisp-eval-depth now that I recall). If not I will check my other loops, but they aren't too bad. There is one that keeps looking at the previous line, so that could get large
[00:51:01] <bpalmer> also, if you've introduced any asynchrony, the inhibition may be bypassed, and you'll be triggering yourself over and over.

[03:55:34] <technomancy> as far as I can tell there are exactly two advantages to docker for how we use it at work: 0) docker has raised billions of dollars that they use to subsidize servers from which we download images and 1) it works on macintoshes
[03:55:43] <aidalgol> And "just use btrfs, zfs, or whatever" is ignoring that a) you now have to all that by hand that docker's layering does for you, and b) at least with ZFS, filesystem-level deduplication has *massive* memory requirements.
[03:56:03] <aidalgol> technomancy: I have no idea how you use it at work, so I can't really comment there.

[08:12:01] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: correct. default directory meaning the pwd when that bit of elisp is being executed

[08:13:08] <wgreenhouse> you probably meant something like (expand-file-name "config.org" user-emacs-directory)
[08:14:03] <gnoo> and that bit of elisp is supposed to execute from a init.el file. i know it won't work if you use a .emacs file but ahooda is using .emacs.d 
[08:14:30] <wgreenhouse> then my suggestion should work
[08:14:55] <wgreenhouse> default-directory when emacs starts is generally not .emacs.d nut whatever directory emacs was run from at the shell
[08:15:08] <wgreenhouse> or whatever the launcher defaults to if started with a gui
[08:15:15] <wgreenhouse> it's also buffer-local
[08:15:29] <wgreenhouse> so assumptions are dangerous
[08:15:33] <wgreenhouse> best to be explicit
[08:15:53] <rdrg109> Regarding my question: I found this package: https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el 
[08:16:31] <rdrg109> which does exactly what I wanted. I don't know how I didn't come across with this before.

[08:17:42] <wgreenhouse> gnoo: it happens to be .emacs.d when visiting init.el because when visiting a file it's set buffer-locally to the location of that file
[08:17:42] <gnoo> thanks wgreenhouse!
[08:18:05] <wgreenhouse> if there's no local value in effect the global default is whereever emacs was started from

[09:44:17] <edrx> I just learned that we can check if a variable was `defvar'-ed by running special-variable-p... for example:
[09:44:22] <edrx> (defvar my-ticker nil)
[09:44:23] <edrx> (special-variable-p 'my-ticker)
[09:45:32] <edrx> but I spent half an hour - ok, 15 minutes - trying to find a way to remove the special-variable-p-ness of a variable, but I couldn't find it.
[09:45:40] <himesama> means not lexically bound
[09:46:10] <himesama> if you just let it idk if it is a variable (it might be just a binding or something) but it woulodnot be special
[09:47:26] <edrx> well, I'm trying to write short tests/demos for all this...
[09:48:00] <himesama> you can shadow with let or substitute it with let.  but beware that top level lexical binding is different in el from cl.

[15:14:16] <_maddy> I am trying to find a theme that looks both in emacs graphical window as well as terminal, and that is a bit of a challenge... the code in Nord, for example, defines the colors on startup based if the windows is graphical or terminal, but I guess that is not good if I plan to open both windows
[15:14:57] <_maddy> like I have been using solarized-dark on normal emacs and really like that, but on terminal it's like bright blue, which is a bit awkward
[15:15:25] <schillingklaus> colours are always awkward
[15:15:44] <schillingklaus> so I do everything to avoid colours
[15:17:13] <kensanata> Well, you can write your own theme that has a better test… Remember that defface can have multiple statements where it says t here: (rcirc-my-nick ((t (:foreground "light blue"))))
[15:17:39] <kensanata> But most theme authors don't do it.
[15:18:27] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.62.99)
[15:19:51] <kensanata> Personally, what I do is load my favourite theme, and then I use custom-theme-set-faces to change the definitions of the faces that bother me the most. Perhaps that's one way forward for _maddy
[15:21:46] <kensanata> So for example: (custom-theme-set-faces 'brutalist-dark '(mode-line-inactive (((color . 8) ((:foreground "gray70"))) (t (:foreground "gray70"))))) or something like that. Read up on the defface doc string.
[15:22:01] <kensanata> "An alist of conditions." is what you're looking for.

[19:20:04] <rnkn> I've wanted to revisit it, so I just watched Evangelion 1.11 and it seemed like there were huge parts missing

[19:49:19] <acdw> ~fancy~
[19:49:23] <wasamasa> and serial experiments lain and its depiction of society being doomed
[19:49:54] <acdw> okay what does 'lain' mena? i see that word everywhere and only now realized it might be an anime ref
[19:50:03] <rnkn> backleet: M-/ is usually dabbrev-expand, it's the easiest form of autocomplete
[19:50:07] <wasamasa> acdw: it's the name of its protagonist
[19:50:53] <alphapapa[m]> How come dystopic doomism is so popular nowadays?  Used to be that popular art seemed to have a more positive outlook, and society seemed better for it.
[19:51:02] <grym> alphapapa[m]: solarpunk is also thriving 
[19:51:14] <alphapapa[m]> grym: That word is new to me
[19:51:35] <rnkn> alphapapa[m]: that is a bold proclamation
[19:51:58] <grym> alphapapa[m]: "cyberpunk, but what if it had a happy ending"
[19:51:58] <wasamasa> granted, I don't recommend feel good things too much
[19:51:58] <alphapapa[m]> rnkn: Well I hope so!
[19:51:59] <acdw> wasamasa: thank you! hmmm
[19:52:05] <alphapapa[m]> But it didn't used to seem so bold.
[19:52:13] <acdw> alphapapa[m]: ... look around
[19:52:26] <wasamasa> JJBA and FLCL are my favorites when it comes to more positive feelings
[19:52:31] <grym> acdw: and you'll see what you want, depending on what color glasses you're wearing 
[19:52:38] <acdw> that report came out. we're already experiencing massive climate change and it's only going to get worse
[19:52:45] <alphapapa[m]> acdw: Yeah, but this trend didn't start a year ago.  Anyway, when in recent memory has humanity needed hopefulness more than now.
[19:52:47] <rnkn> alphapapa[m]: I think those 3 statements are all pretty debatable
[19:52:48] <acdw> so like, it's pretty intense right now
[19:52:53] <backleet> rnkn: I found the problem, lsp server is just not providing completion support for some reason.
[19:53:01] <wasamasa> to show how ridiculous things can be if you pull them to their logical conclusion
[19:53:09] <acdw> alphapapa[m]: sure the report came out just now, but it's been obvious for YEARS.
[19:53:11] <alphapapa[m]> rnkn: I know you do, Paul.  :)
[19:53:16] <backleet> rnkn: so it's showing unrelated built-in completions
[19:53:30] <acdw> i think that's where it comes from. there is plenty of hope around, but that particular scene is more hopless i think
[19:53:33] <alphapapa[m]> acdw: I'm referring to the trend of dystopian art being popular, not yet another doom report.
[19:53:49] <rnkn> backleet: the thing I like about dabbrev-expand is that it's dumb, and dumb = simple
[19:53:49] <acdw> see: superhero movies
[19:54:23] <wasamasa> I have my theories on why it would feel that way
[19:54:29] <rnkn> alphapapa[m]: I don't think there has been a period where dystopia has not been popular
[19:54:41] <rnkn> *dystopian art
[19:54:45] <backleet> rnkn: yeah but without proper lsp it doesn't know how to complete tags etc, right?
[19:54:48] <acdw> alphapapa[m]: i understand, i was just mentioning that report (also: not "not yet another"!) to illustrate how dire things are
[19:54:55] <acdw> lots of despair in general
[19:54:58] <wasamasa> like there being more depth and detail to overall disagreeable things
[19:55:00] <alphapapa[m]> rnkn: Were dystopian themes popular in the mid 20th century?
[19:55:07] <acdw> plus the politics of ... everyhwere ... are shit
[19:55:15] <grym> acdw: "“Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf. 'It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not." 
[19:55:19] <acdw> alphapapa[m]: 1984, brave new world, handmaid's tale
[19:55:22] <rnkn> alphapapa[m]: of course, all the atomic bomb anxiety
[19:55:24] <wasamasa> for example there only being one good exit code, but many bad ones
[19:55:25] <grym> keep ya head up, otherwise we're never getting out of this :) 
[19:55:27] <wgreenhouse> alphapapa[m]: fuck yes, see The Twilight Zone being one of the most popular things on TV

[19:55:43] <oats> I heard portugal's doing ok lately
[19:55:45] <oats> any truth to that?

[19:55:56] <grym> oats: friend was there a few weeks ago, hasn't died yet! 
[19:55:58] <wgreenhouse> alphapapa[m]: even Star Trek in its era presented lots of dystopias, and endured the same sort of criticism
[19:56:12] <rnkn> zombie movies were born in mid-20th C
[19:56:15] <alphapapa[m]> acdw: I think you read too much news.  Things are actually not so dire.  The world situation has steadily improved over the past several centuries.  World poverty is at all-time lows, and world health at all-time highs, for example.  But the media doesn't report things like that, because good news doesn't generate clicks.
[19:56:17] <acdw> yap
[19:56:34] <wgreenhouse> the federation itself is a form of utopia, but trek is a dystopia-visiting machine, often aimed squarely at society of its day
[19:56:55] <alphapapa[m]> Twilight Zone was not dystopian.  Star Trek was certainly not dystopian either; it presented a very optimistic outlook for humanity.
[19:56:56] <rnkn> alphapapa[m]: the climate says otherwise
[19:57:10] <alphapapa[m]> rnkn: The climate is not a person; it doesn't say anything.
[19:57:16] <acdw> alphapapa[m]: i mean. yes that's good. but also. things are in motion that by the end of our lifetime will cause all of that to reverse and worsen
[19:57:33] <oats> p
[19:57:35] <alphapapa[m]> acdw: acdw: That's probably nonsense.  But that's what the media keeps telling us.
[19:57:51] <oats> pretty undeniable at this point that climate change is gonna reverse some of those positive trends, at this point
[19:57:52] <acdw> bruh. ok
[19:58:02] <oats> I'm hopeful that we'll at least be able to mitigate it a bit
[19:58:04] <rnkn> yeah I don't buy that usual argument about increases in literacy and decreases in poverty meaning that the world is getting better; it's a very anthropectric perspective
[19:58:07] <wgreenhouse> alphapapa[m]: Trek was nonetheless often labeled as defeatist propaganda, unamerican, etc. for the social commentary it made. as I said, the Federation (or more properly, the bridge crew of the Enterprise, because that's all we see) is utopian, but the societies they visit are often dystopias.
[19:58:18] <acdw> yeah it's the five-year anniversary of some of the worst flooding in louisiana's history today but like w/e
[19:58:22] <rnkn> there is more CO2 in the atmosphere than there has been in 2 million years
[19:58:24] <acdw> the west coast is on fire
[19:58:28] <wgreenhouse> often with a pretty heavyhanded critique of the now
[19:58:29] <acdw> greece, turkey on fire
[19:58:37] <alphapapa[m]> rnkn: Wat?  If not for humanity, what does this space rock matter?  It'll be gone in a few years when the sun expands anyway.
[19:58:50] <wasamasa> another thing is that it takes considerable effort to figure out how things became better, but it's easy to point out how they've got worse

[20:00:35] <oats> what
[20:00:41] <wgreenhouse> alphapapa[m]: sure. utopia and dystopia are often paired in fiction. audiences were meant to see themselves in the societies trapped in nuclear cold war, or the last white-and-black-faced guy chasing the last black-and-white-faced guy with murderous intent. just showing the utopia would've meant no story at all.

[20:22:01] <taeaad> But if the question is whether we can see that the climate is changing, yes. You can do a yearly PCA over 40 years and you'll see that it starts to jump more in the last 20 years than the first 20 years. Jump as in, more visible variation year-on-year. But that's not technically a proof since you can have localised climate change without a 100 year change.

[23:30:05] <hoppity> I also tried with the "Try" package which always works, but nothing.
[23:30:06] <quippy> wap-mode, hm, that's got a new meaning these days, thanks to pop culture
[23:30:15] <alphapapa[m]> hoppity: Maybe your Emacs completion settings need adjusting, because the command is "let-it-snow", sorry :)
[23:30:17] <JordiGH> I think Matt Murdock took on... uh... did he take every kind of case?
[23:30:43] <JordiGH> wgreenhouse: Thanks! I saw your convo in the jmp.chat group chat but right now I can't connect to Dismail to talk there.
[23:30:43] <dale> JordiGH: I think Daredevil has been around like sixty years by now, so yeah, probably.
[23:30:50] <hoppity> alphapapa[m]: yeah, googling I around gound the command to be let it snow but nothing
[23:31:07] <wgreenhouse> JordiGH: oh about debt collection shittiness? that's a usual bailiwick 
[23:31:08] <alphapapa[m]> hoppity: Sorry, what?
[23:31:27] <hoppity> M-x let-it-snow does not show up as an option either
[23:31:39] <hoppity> I installed from list-packages, should I be doing somethign else?
[23:31:58] <wgreenhouse> JordiGH: I do a lot of telling clients not to pay people who cold call them

[23:32:12] <dale> One of the things I get told by legal professionals when they watch lawyers on TV is how unrealistic it is that the same lawyer, on a weekly basis, has the skills and time to show up in civil court, criminal court, they do immigration in the morning, probate law in the afternoon, and maybe a last minute murder case in the evening.
[23:32:14] <alphapapa[m]> hoppity: Oh, sorry, the command is M-x snow, I forgot that I renamed it to be...well, easier to find.  Looks like I omitted an autoload, so you need to (require 'snow), I guess.
[23:32:54] <alphapapa[m]> hoppity: Or just reinstall the package (from git), I just pushed a fix with the autoload
[23:33:08] <wgreenhouse> dale: there are still country solo practitioners like that (I know some, since I basically live in the woods). it's...not too terribly efficient
[23:33:10] <hoppity> alphapapa[m]: that was fast, thanks
[23:33:24] <alphapapa[m]> Magit makes it fast :)
[23:33:54] <wgreenhouse> dale: the most implausible part of Matt Murdock for me is that he exists in a city where office rents are high

[23:34:19] <hoppity> Snow is working now, love it haha
[23:34:20] <dale> wgreenhouse: Really, they exist?  First I'm hearing of this.
[23:34:38] <alphapapa[m]> hoppity: :)
[23:35:01] <dale> wgreenhouse: In the Netflix TV series he looked like he's working out of an abandoned bodega, at least for a while.  (I didn't watch all of it.)
[23:35:14] <wgreenhouse> dale: general solo practitioners? yeah. one of our good clinic volunteers does criminal defense and personal injury and landlord-tenant
[23:35:26] <wgreenhouse> but also lives in a town where office rents are cheap 
[23:36:28] <dale> wgreenhouse: That's really interesting.  I'm going to tell the paralegal sitting three feet from me.

[23:37:15] <wgreenhouse> dale: this is in Vermont, btw, so the entire list of attorneys in good standing fits in one PDF file. that may also help this still be viable. :P
[23:37:15] <dale> wgreenhouse: Though perhaps one difference is that, on TV, they're usually trying complicated murder, litigating multi-billion dollar acquisitions, etc.  I assume more complicated cases couldn't be handled this way, at least not competently.
[23:37:46] <dale> wgreenhouse: Holy shit I had no idea how few people are in Vermont.
[23:38:12] <wgreenhouse> yeah DC has more people than the whole state

[23:39:17] <wgreenhouse> another example, one of the better Social Security disability attorneys I know here in private practice also has a juvenile defender contract
[23:39:39] <wgreenhouse> so she evens out that very lumpy business with a high volume one
[23:40:05] <dale> wgreenhouse: I really just thought it was a matter of having intimate familiarity with all the laws, rules, and procedures involved in different types of law, not to mention things like common tactics specific to each area of practice, or even knowing the people you're likely to go up against.

[23:41:27] <JordiGH> > fits in one PDF file
[23:41:33] <JordiGH> Do PDF files have length limits?
[23:41:36] <wgreenhouse> sure. complete generalists are rare, but it's possible to have two or three practice areas you do well, and might make sense for business reasons
[23:41:57] <dale> wgreenhouse: Makes sense.  Thank you for taking the time to elaborate on that. :)

[23:52:11] <bpalmer> the Census released some data recently that many people I know were looking at, showing that 2010-2020 continued the same trend as from 2000-2010 where the cities are growing and the rest of the country is shrinking.
[23:52:17] <rpav> #emacs helps those who help themselves
[23:52:25] <alphapapa[m]> ,user-error ?  maybe?  just a little?
[23:52:26] <fsbot> alphapapa[m], user-error is [0] "Don't do that!"
[23:52:26] <fsbot> [1] an alias for function `electrocute-user'
[23:52:44] <bpalmer> There's a chance that 2020-2030 will be dominated by remote work and people spreading out, but if trends continue, I guess Vermont is likely to shrink even more.
[23:53:03] <cvanduse`> It's cold there.

[23:54:49] <rpav> other than if you look at it, it's actually a really weird word
[23:55:06] <wgreenhouse> bpalmer: we gained 20k people during '20 but unclear how much of that will be momentary "pandemic refugees" and how many will stay
[23:55:09] <bpalmer> If I'm remembering correctly, Vermont is where both It Can't Happen Here and The Handmaid's Tale were set, which seems odd.
[23:55:31] <wgreenhouse> bpalmer: Handmaid's Tale is lightly disguised Cambridge, MA
[23:55:43] <wgreenhouse> basically at Harvard and environs
[23:55:48] <bpalmer> those groucho marx glasses fooled me!
[23:55:54] <wgreenhouse> lol
[23:56:26] <bpalmer> That's ... huh. Interesting; definitely makes me think.
[23:56:43] <alphapapa[m]> See now you're really missing out on the EYEGLASSES emoji reaction I sent on the Matrix side of the bridge
[23:57:06] <bpalmer> When I first read The Handmaid's Tale, I actually thought it was *only* the state of Vermont which had been taken over, and the rest of the country went on doing its own thing; I thought it was a really interesting depiction of how even a "small" territory can seem huge when you're trapped inside it
[23:57:50] <bpalmer> I still think that'd be far more plausible and interesting than an overnight rebellion that takes over the entire country at once.
