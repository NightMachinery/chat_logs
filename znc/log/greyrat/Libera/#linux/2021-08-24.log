[02:00:47] <jim> felco, there's a #hexchat here, and generally, the project lead hangs out there
[02:00:55] <djph> xx: sure, in your .profile (.bashrc, .bash_profile, /etc/profile, and so on)
[02:01:04] <barteks2x> or at least replace the invalid characters as the files are being extracted?
[02:01:25] <tomreyn> barteks2x: you'll probably have a much easier life if you'll unpack this to a file system that's commonly used for / on linux systems first of all.
[02:01:28] <felco> Yeah, HexChat is GTK so it will get the themes for it, you have any
[02:01:29] <xx> djph: does that mean that I should always use \rm in my scripts? I've never seen that before this.
[02:01:33] <djph> npo
[02:01:35] <djph> no
[02:01:59] <tomreyn> barteks2x: you could still rename then, and move it to ntfs if needed.
[02:01:59] <barteks2x> (also through all of it I would like to preserve the timestamps on the files)

[02:06:52] <felco> But I think the Theme Manager will not compile on Linux by default, to not mess with the GTK setup, I think...
[02:07:05] <jim> then you'd have facts rather than conjecture
[02:07:17] <felco> jim: even if you set to compile the theme manager, it will not compile on linux
[02:07:21] <wigums> dont need a theme manager. atleast for linux. i dont remember having to use one for windows either

[02:11:53] <jim> exactly... so maybe it's a good idea for this case, to stop guessing and ask the people who work on hexchat?
[02:12:10] <felco> On Hexchat you have that color file, and the GTK theme, on Windows it can get ugly
[02:12:14] <barteks2x> ... it extracted some files with names like "some\directory\filename" instead of it being directory tree...
[02:12:16] <wigums> just cuz YOU dont know doesnt make it so
[02:12:32] <barteks2x> any way to get around that?

[03:04:22] <Psi-Jack> I mean, if you go that route with x11, you'll need to install at least a reasonable DE, like Xfce or something, and just keep it minimal.

[09:33:25] <backleet> keep it under <=5 maybe

[11:26:43] <DPA> Keep in mind that CIDR can't represent every netmask. For example, 255.255.0.255 is a valid netmask, containing 256 IPs (one of which is broadcast, and one the network address), but it can't be expressed in cidr.
[11:26:44] <DPA> It can be dangerouse to use such netmasks though, people tend to get anygry when they find out about it.

[12:59:17] <WhatCanIDo> hi guys i would like to ask for your help :)  I'm reviewing the server logs. I have a mounted *.img file from local drive (/dev/loop0). In server logs i have extreme amounts of the following error: EXT4-fs error (loop0) in ext4_do_update_inode:4782: error 27. I also checked lsof and nothing is writting to that directory.... any suggestions?

[15:36:53] <fakuve> Hey gutten gutten guys . Just a question , I'm not really versed in general on string manipulation, I want to apply a Regex in a file, so that the same file will get modified by it , such as `sed 's/\~\/Documents/\/home\/fakuve\/programs2/g' /home/fakuve/downloads/vm-files/scripts/domains.sh > /home/fakuve/downloads/vm-files/scripts/domains.sh`

[15:38:44] <fakuve> alrights thanks hexnewbie
[15:39:23] <fakuve> I thought there would be sort of a built in way to do this?
[15:40:53] <hexnewbie> fakuve: sed has -i
[15:41:16] <hexnewbie> fakuve: sed -i.bak ... , but for general commands, you cannot read from a file you've already erased, and need 'sponge'
[15:41:42] <djph> ew, that -i switch is ... ehh ...
[15:42:05] <peetaur> fakuve: when you run that command    x inputfile > outputfile    it is bash that opens outputfile and truncates it before x is even run so the file is empty ....if inputfile is outputfile, that doesn't work well

[15:44:11] <peetaur> and yeah sed -i is the solution if you know it works, but if you want to be more safe, you can also just append .tmp on there and then mv the .tmp to the otherr when done. For a one off command I'd use -i ...but for a script, I'd do more checks and do the tmp file and mv thing. (also gives you power failure safety)

[16:26:26] <hexnewbie> I'm 95% confident mv works if it is on the same filesystem, I use it as vfs.rename() for safe overwrite in my SSH filesystem implementations (5% unsure, since it's been a decade since I verified the behaviour)

[16:27:37] <hexnewbie> Of course, mv is pointless unless you create the source file with dd conv=fsync
[16:27:43] <peetaur> crash consistency is like imagine your power goes out...so you want to guarantee you have one file or the other completely, and the original path must have a valid file (not a blank file which could happen without sync.... maybe the mv finished but the write didn't, so you just mv an empty file)

[21:40:27] <webby> It seems that appimage is more flexible on older distros, but you can potentially run it without sandboxing (unlike flatpak which requires sandboxing, but that in itself has its own pros and cons). Though unless you're running a 10 year old distro, age seems to be a bit irrelevant.
[21:41:06] <bparker> none of them even solve the issue of old distros anyway because they're not built against older libcs

[21:45:53] <uwharrie> I just find the whole thing odd. If I pick a stable distro with older packages, its because it has the features needed to get things done. If it's missing features I need, I'm not going to bother installing it, not try and shoehorn in some secondary package manager to chase the latest versions
