[00:21:36] <olle> We do have wrappers for each vendor, yes.

[01:30:38] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[01:30:45] <Voxel> Wher would you put the session object?
[01:30:50] <Voxel> In MVC
[01:30:57] <Voxel> In controller or model?
[01:31:14] <ramblebamble> Voxel neither, put it in the request
[01:31:19] <Voxel> ?
[01:31:27] <ramblebamble> or at least that is what I would do
[01:31:39] <judah> What ramblebamble said, stick it in the request. If you must, it belongs more in a controller than a model
[01:31:43] <Voxel> By session object I mean, a class instance with methods to authorize, check authorization etc.
[01:31:56] <Voxel> Model doesn't make sense since it's just to get and prepare data
[01:32:10] <ramblebamble> Some case, you authenticate a request
[01:32:21] <judah> I would make your session class a part of the request instance that you pass to your controller
[01:32:35] <judah> DI might be able to help you here
[01:32:35] <Voxel> What do you mean by request?
[01:32:39] <ramblebamble> MVC is more of a guideline, you cannot map everything into the view, the controller and the model

[01:33:08] <ramblebamble> Voxel, the code/class representation of $_POST,$_GET, $_REQUEST
[01:33:35] <ramblebamble> olle good thinking PSR-15
[01:33:56] <Voxel> Currently, controller object stores config, model, view and session objects. Prepared in construct and stored in protected main class.
[01:34:28] <Voxel> Main Controller class (i.e. protected $model).
[01:34:31] <ramblebamble> that is one mighty fat controller, you should consider moving logic out, otherwise it will get very crowded
[01:34:56] <netfrog> shell_exec doesn't work for me and the error log stays empty
[01:35:07] <Voxel> Then, custom controller (i.e. for /login) extends the main and inherits model, session, and config
[01:35:11] <ramblebamble> Also models are transient in the controller so there should not be need for a property keeping the model
[01:35:24] *** Quits: ThePhilgrim (~ThePhilgr@151.41.185.44) (Quit: ThePhilgrim)
[01:35:30] <Voxel> ramblebamble, models are also custom per controller
[01:35:53] <netfrog> what can i do?
[01:35:54] <Voxel> Something like custom controller, model, and view. However all extend their main classes.
[01:36:49] <ramblebamble> Voxel choose composition over inheritance it makes your life easier, also the real power comes from controllers being able to mix and match models as required per use-case
[01:37:02] <ramblebamble> otherwise you will leak the logic for the composition, data-relations to the calling client
[01:37:04] <ramblebamble> not good
[01:37:07] <Voxel> $_REQUEST or $_COOKIES might store some data. However, the question is where to store methods to verify authorization.
[01:37:30] <ramblebamble> A class representing the request
[01:37:47] <Voxel> Currently, it's in Session class, which is protected in Controller. Other controllers (i.e. /login) accesses it like $this->session->isAuthorized())
[01:38:01] <Voxel> ramblebamble, hm
[01:38:03] <ramblebamble> or at least references to that logic there, that way the logic for authentication stays mallable
[01:38:08] <olle> Which framework is this?
[01:38:12] <Voxel> olle, there's no
[01:38:20] <olle> Because?
[01:38:23] <Voxel> Because
[01:38:28] <olle> ^^
[01:38:45] <ramblebamble> Voxel look at Laravel, Symfony, Drupal, Wordpress, etc. browse the code there is a reason they are associating it with the request
[01:40:02] <Voxel> Currently, there's a router which checks path, classes, creates the controller object, and "launches" the application.
[01:40:22] <Voxel> It's simply /controller/action?args
[01:40:45] <Voxel> Each controller gets only $args
[01:41:07] <Voxel> Would you prepare request in router and pass it to controller?
[01:41:25] <Voxel> Something like controller->action($request, $args)
[01:41:42] <Voxel> Something like controller->action($request, $model, $config, $args)
[01:41:44] <ramblebamble> what about POST, also note that if the router is operating on the request itself you will have a non-standardized way of dealing with that, you ought to create an init-function, bootstrap the application, create the request and then proceed to routing
[01:41:44] <Voxel> *
[01:43:23] <Voxel> I wanted to optimize it via checking the path before creating request since client may try to spam with invalid data (i.e. non-supported controller/action), but system would create specific objects (i.e. request/session) each time.
[01:43:57] <ramblebamble> that will not scale trust me
[01:44:01] <Voxel> Currently, it doesn't connect to any database before checking the actual path, so... I thought to move router to the very beggining.
[01:44:17] <Voxel> ramblebamble, scale to what? For example?
[01:45:21] <ramblebamble> creating a request-class representing the request does not need DB-access, also note that I can still spam calling endpoints that do exist and then just use bogus data, also note that you should not put that in production, just use it as a training excercise to understand things
[01:45:46] <ramblebamble> there is a reason frameworks are so successful because they prevent you from implementing the obvous footguns of getting your server owned
[01:46:12] *** Joins: tuskkk____ (uid18470@id-18470.tinside.irccloud.com)
[01:46:41] <ramblebamble> if you check the request before doing anything else, because you are scared of being spammed, you will have a non-standardized way, that is maintenance hell and you will only optimize in the permill area where it does not really matter if at all.
[01:47:31] <Voxel> Request class... Would it include session? I don't get yet
[01:47:43] <ramblebamble> yes
[01:47:43] <Voxel> What would it include?
[01:47:51] *** Joins: delboy1978uk (~delboy197@d51A4773C.access.telenet.be)
[01:48:31] <Voxel> How would session access database?
[01:48:52] <ramblebamble> pathinfo, all of $_SERVER, all of $_POST, $_GET,  $_COOKIE, the session, logic/better references to logic for authentication, if you take the laravel-approach also verification for request
[01:49:21] <ramblebamble> the session is just a representation of data and state of the client's interaction with the server, it does not access the DB
[01:49:50] <ramblebamble> Depending on fat or thin model the model may, but I advise against this, the controller can and the businesslogic
[01:50:55] <ramblebamble> you may also implement your own authentication-layer in which you pass the request, so that logic is not part of the request model
[01:51:11] <Voxel> So, bootstrap would create request and router objects, and pass request to router?
[01:51:15] <ramblebamble> but that are design-decisions you can toy around with on your own
[01:51:30] <ramblebamble> yes

[01:53:13] <Voxel> How Session and "references to logic for authentication and authorization" would meet?
[01:53:42] <ramblebamble> the same way a property gets its value, constructing it.
[01:54:32] <Voxel> Where? Router? I mean, would router (with request and session inside objects) pass database to request->session?
[01:55:27] <Voxel> I mean, for example, controller checks if the user is authorized, and it would be somethng like (DI) $this->request->session->isAuthorized() or something
[01:55:34] <ramblebamble> no you are miles away from the database at that point
[01:55:37] <Voxel> Inside it would query db
[01:55:43] <Voxel> hm..
[01:57:35] <ramblebamble> you may, during bootstrapping create a DB-connection and object wrapping it, or defer it till it is needed,  the router will choose a route as per request and then check if the request is permitted, and that is where the DB-connection starts to make sense, and the you move on to the controller
[01:58:07] <ramblebamble> and don't forget to process execptions and handle the not so sweet paths of the request-processing resulting in a status-code != 2xx
[01:58:27] <Voxel> So, create a DB conn each request?
[01:59:09] <ramblebamble> yes unless you run roadrunner, swoole which I advise against considering your savyness, keep it simple, otherwise you will have to handle the DB-timeout at one point gracefully as well
[01:59:15] <Voxel> Perhaps you meant creating a DB instance in bootstrap and pass it to router
[01:59:29] <ramblebamble> on instance and connection
[01:59:39] <ramblebamble> on --> no
[01:59:59] <Voxel> However, an actual connection would not appear immediately, but only on first actual DB request
[02:00:08] <ramblebamble> no
[02:00:12] <Voxel> Why not?
[02:00:29] <Voxel> I mean, this would literally spam the DB with connections, no?
[02:01:00] <ramblebamble> whatever it is you are building, trust me when I tell you that it can handle way more
[02:01:01] <Voxel> There might be pages which doesn't even require DB connection at all
[02:01:32] <Voxel> don't*
[02:02:05] <judah> setting up db connections to a local socket has such low overhead as to not really matter. You could wait to instantiate the connection until you make a request though
[02:02:36] <Voxel> ^
[02:02:41] <Voxel> The last part
[02:03:01] <Voxel> Just query() would check if connection exist and connect if not connected, that's it
[02:03:22] <Voxel> exists*
[02:04:54] <ramblebamble> judah, on that note, do you know how it is generally handled, I mean best practice, when I look at horizontally scaling PHP-FPM, they must be using network-connections instead of sockets, would they also defere it in that case?

[02:09:43] <judah> ramblebamble, it depends on the software and implementation but typically those sorts of things use some form of connection pooling or proxy. This way the number of connections to the database is minimized where possible.
[02:10:19] <ramblebamble> And the proxy can cache I have seen it with SQLProxy or ProxySQL once
[02:10:49] <ramblebamble> I mean on a code-base usually you do not make this assumption when writing code for a framework
[02:11:36] <ramblebamble> speaking of which I had a check and looked at Drupal, Voxel, what you can also do is not create the DB-connection per route but wrap it in dedicated classes, and when you need to query the DB you use that class which does the magic for you

[02:30:19] <ramblebamble> but get the models
[02:31:14] <Voxel> Hmm
[02:31:16] <ramblebamble> and if you say the session is part of the request, that is then not a method in the controller saying getcurrentuser but the request given to the method processing the request that has that method, as I said design-descions

[06:27:38] <TML> Error: You're probably not doing anything wrong, per se; just close the connection and re-open it from time to time.
[06:28:59] <TML> (although, my more emotional response is "What you're doing wrong is writing a TCP server in PHP")
[06:31:12] <Error> im just trying to run a command line paste bin
[06:32:20] <Blondie101010> you can increase the timeout to see if that helps, but I suspect the problem is the opposite, that your process is not able to satisfy the demand
[06:35:36] <Blondie101010> when implementing a socket server, accepting new requests should be top priority
[06:37:54] <Error> so is it getting timedout bcos its not getting any requests?
[06:38:11] <Blondie101010> I don't think that's possible
[06:38:50] <Blondie101010> did you notice if it happens when there's an increase in demand?
[06:39:30] <Error> well there is not demand for it yet! i was just trying to learn
[06:39:59] <Blondie101010> so you're just doing intermittent tests and all of a sudden it stops for things that previously worked?
[06:40:43] <Error> i actually had two issues
[06:41:45] <Error> it was just showing a part of the file
[06:42:12] <Error> so i changed fread() to stream_get_contents()
[06:42:34] <Error> when im running it.. it works fine for like few minites

[06:43:18] <Error> and terminate
[06:43:46] <Error> i was thinking there is some issue line 6
[06:45:12] <Blondie101010> how do you test it?  do you do individual connections or run a batch of them
[06:45:48] <Error> individual
[06:46:21] <Error> like echo test | nc address 8888

[13:11:35] <tirnanog> it's hard to interpret the thrust of the question as it was never established what they wanted to change. it might have been a poorly phrased way of saying "touch() isn't good enough for me as I'm not interested in chaing mtimes". but who knows.

[14:14:14] <TML> hans: I don't understand the question
[14:14:18] <TinoDidriksen> hans, use pcregrep instead if you want complex regex.
[14:14:20] <hans> bugs.php.net never did require an account tho, but now i think they're using github instead

[17:23:47] <toolbox> Looking to build a salary software in Laravel and would like to let user add their gross salary, then the system should dynamically calc and show net salary, and % of taxes. This should be dynamically presented without user need of pressing a send button. Is that a work for JS?
[17:24:46] <Naktibalda> it looks like homework
[17:25:15] <Naktibalda> yes, you need some JS
[17:25:23] <toolbox> Nope, just need to improve skills in Laravel, but the frontend dynamic part I assume will not be solved by Laravel.
[17:26:00] <Naktibalda> olle: I think that you have to use getFilename(), getStartLine(), getEndLine() and read the code from the source file
[17:27:22] <__adrian> olle: what Naktibalda said, but in practice, "no" (this is why "superclosure" libraries break if you put two closures on one line)
[17:27:37] <__adrian> it's incredible fragile and _almost_ as useless
[17:28:20] <__adrian> "toolbox> ...and % of taxes"  lol, yeah, let's just casually throw that in there.
[17:28:34] <olle> Naktibalda: Yep, just realized :)
[17:29:01] <olle> I just need a unique id for each closure
[17:29:09] <olle> Not the actual code
[17:29:12] <__adrian> give them uuids
[17:29:17] <Nekomander> Naktibalda, I remember the 3v4l paste that you've made, that's certainly a bug. xD I tried different variations of this and I can imagine it causing problems for when that token script is parsed in the future.
[17:29:48] <__adrian> (or do you mean unique, even across requests?)
[17:29:55] <Nekomander> I mean the tokens it outputs. I didn't go as far as to test that though, but certainly, it's doing things that it shouldn't/
[17:30:07] <olle> Other question: Does PHPUnit define any constant to show it's running? PHPUNIT_DEBUG or whatever
[17:30:31] <olle> __adrian: No, unique in the code, so file + line is enough
[17:30:35] <Naktibalda> Nekomander: I added a quick fix to check if tokens that matter to me are not followed by colon
[17:31:06] <Naktibalda> I will try report it unless someone beats me
[17:31:07] <__adrian> olle: unless you put two on one line.
[17:31:12] <__adrian> what is the id for?
[17:31:38] <Nekomander> Okie dokie. Nice find by the way.
[17:32:05] <olle> __adrian: still working on that do() que() thingy
[17:32:20] <Naktibalda> not my find too, someone else raised an issue on Github.

[18:18:24] <Naktibalda> I've seen a logger, implemented 15 years ago, that was supposed to write logs in destructor, but nobody trusted it to work and called ->flush() explicitly right after logging something

[19:07:58] <__adrian> taxes are not something _you_ (the programmer) should be figuring out. a SME (e.g., an accountant) should be providing very, very specific process for it. and that's assuming there's some legitimate reason to not farm it out to a company that specifically deals with taxes.
[19:09:36] <arash> Hello, I want to create a new object from PDO class in my own class, I don't want to pass database information to my class each time I want create an instance from that class, so is it ok to declare those database information (username, password etc) in __construct function?
[19:10:09] <__adrian> "I don't want to pass database information to my class each time"  this is not something you should want.
[19:10:17] <biberu> no, pass a connection or something that returns a connection when asked for it
[19:10:24] <__adrian> passing info as arguments is the correct approach. other approaches are wrong.
[19:10:57] <Naktibalda_> passing PDO instance as argument is better

[19:30:42] <biberu> what __adrian already said, but as a general observation constructors shouldn't "do" anything, they should accept what they need (e.g. a connection) from outside and initialize the object to a valid state

[19:47:57] <biberu> arash: your constructor is still doing too much, it's not just initializing the instance, it's now opening connections, talking to the rest of the world, it has potentially weird behavior and unexpected reasons to fail

[19:49:16] <biberu> arash: if connect() fails it has a side effect that prints internal error details to god knows what, the calling code is never informed, and will probably try to use the instance despite it now being in an *invalid* state (violating the main responsibility of the constructor)
