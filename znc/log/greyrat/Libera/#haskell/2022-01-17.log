[06:20:21] <leibniz> idk, thats the proposal
[06:20:26] <EvanR> ok, make it

[06:21:04] <leibniz> if it doesnt commute with the monad
[06:21:29] <leibniz> i think this motivates some kind of superclass or something but i cant figure it out
[06:22:17] <leibniz> either you need to make a constraint that the monad and the applicative commute, or you need to only use applicatives like State that commute with arbitrary monads

[10:09:13] <EvanR> yeah by dependent function i mean a function with a Pi type
[10:09:29] <EvanR> where the type of output depends on the input value
[10:11:20] <hololeap> what I understand of dependent types, is that things like finite-typelits can be expressed more naturally, and with arbitrary types (as opposed to just Nat/Integer). does this relate to what I just described, or am I mistaken?
[10:12:43] <hololeap> sorry, there's a lot to unpack there. I should probably get some understanding of what dependent types are before asking ths.

[10:16:11] <hololeap> as far as dependent-map goes, I am going to use it to parse key-value pairs where different keys have different representations. I'll also have a Text "key" for unmatched representations, and a () (or Comment) key for comments

[10:17:40] *** Joins: bollu (~bollu@159.65.151.13)
[10:17:41] <geekosaur> I think you're asking for the opposite of dependent-map? you want all the keys to have different types, instead of the values?

[10:18:15] <hololeap> no, I phrased that incorrectly, I meant "where different keys have different _value_ representations"
[10:19:18] <geekosaur> okay, then this may be for you. it's not really dependent types although it's closely related
[10:20:18] <hololeap> for instance, a key with the text "name" would yield a Name as its value, where "address" would yield an Address as its value
[10:20:27] *** Joins: _ht (~quassel@2a02:a468:b619:1:a06e:65c3:1bfa:20a6)
[10:20:55] <geekosaur> (I think internally it uses TypeRep and cast from Data.Typeable, so actually it's closer to dynamic typing, but to the extent that each key determines the type of a value, it's more principled than dynamic typing)
[10:21:13] <hololeap> it doesn't fit very well into the traditional Map representation where all keys are one type and all values are also one type
[10:22:33] <awpr> it does seem applicable here, but is there some reason this can't be just a record?  I guess accepting arbitrary orderings of fields could be fiddly if not using a map to accumulate them
[10:23:00] <geekosaur> also partial records are a PITA
[10:23:16] <hololeap> yes, and there may be multiple lines of the same field with different values, and the values need to be appended
[10:24:08] <hololeap> for instance: Address: 123 Main St -- this may be one of multiple "Address:" lines
[10:24:18] <awpr> doesn't seem to be a problem for a record, especially if zero lines of a given field should be an empty value in whatever monoid
[10:24:31] <geekosaur> yeh, at that point it sounds like a record oflists

[10:25:26] <awpr> (or HKD record where you collect everything and then validate that all the required bits were set at the end)
[10:26:02] <hololeap> so accumulate it into a record of Text, and then split it into different types later?
[10:26:41] <geekosaur> no, you accumulate it into a record of typed fields, you just initialize all of those fields to [] or whatever before parsing
[10:26:42] <awpr> `data Thing = Thing { address :: Text, phones :: [IntOrSomething] }`
[10:26:58] <geekosaur> this assumes you know all the types up front; if you don't then you may be back to a dependent map
[10:27:08] <geekosaur> but then if you don't it may be difficult to work with anyway
[10:27:12] <awpr> also assumes finitely many fields / a fixed set of fields
[10:27:27] <hololeap> ok so they all have to be monoids and are initialized with mempty
[10:27:48] <hololeap> all the fields
[10:27:48] <awpr> yeah, that's one option, if it makes sense for them all to be accreted monoidally from each KV entry
[10:28:21] <hololeap> that's basically what I'm doing, is a mappend operation from each line that comes in
[10:28:49] <hololeap> ok, that makes sense

[10:30:59] <hololeap> I was imagining this as one giant Map with different types, but it makes sense to create a sum of Maps, each with different types
[10:31:20] <hololeap> or something like that
[10:32:02] <hololeap> it doesn't even have to be a map since it already has

[10:35:45] <hololeap> is it preferable to run a parser library on individual lines, or give it the whole input and break it into lines within the library?
[10:37:57] <dsal> aLine `endBy` "\n"
[10:38:55] <dsal> Though, it depends, I guess.  I run attoparsec on a line at a time in a line based streaming protocol.

[17:37:07] <geekosaur> probably does, but it's limited. there's an lsp-mode in emacs iirc, then you can use hls as the language server
[17:37:38] <geekosaur> in fact I thought spacemacs came with that setup enabled

[19:30:55] <jkaye> Worked for me this morning
[19:31:12] <sclv> just worked for me. but any proxy between you and hackage might screw up things
[19:31:23] <Athas> My $HOME/.cabal.config points at http://hackage.haskell.org/.
[19:31:38] <sclv> right -- but do you have any network proxies in place?
[19:31:52] <Athas> I guess there might be an intermediate proxy (I'm on a university network), but it'd have to be a recent screwup.  It has worked for years.
[19:32:06] <sclv> you can also try passing different --http-transport args which might work around that?

[21:02:57] <delYsid> interesting, it looks so obvious once its implemented, I would be surprised if it hadn't been invented yet.
[21:03:35] <sshine> delYsid, there might be reasons why you'd wish to nest ListMaps in a very explicit way as you do, i.e., you nest your configuration in a modular way, and you can load configurations and embed them into nested key-combination scopes, if that's what they're used for.
[21:03:38] <delYsid> xerox: C-h v, or any kind of sequence of keystrokes.

[21:33:48] <jkaye> slack1256, that would be a little weird since NominalDiffTime is a length of time and not a point in time
[21:34:09] <slack1256> Exactly, it is an interval.
[21:34:52] <slack1256> That 6-tuple is an interval of time
[21:34:55] <monochrom> "1 year" may be 365 days or 366 days.  Would you like the average?

[23:20:13] <qrpnxz> ooooh, i always thought of applicative as pure and <*>, but liftA2 is cool too! Lifting a two argument function gets you thinking about general pairwise combination, where application is a special case. `id` being able to type (a -> b -> c) into ((b -> c) -> b -> c) hence giving you `<*>` is pretty neat too. Currying super power strickes again. Similar trick occurs with `fix`.
