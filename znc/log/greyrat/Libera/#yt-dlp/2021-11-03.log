[20:10:38] <Mateon1> Seems like a rather small place, but whatever. Is 137 (h264 1080p) getting throttled for anyone else, too?
[20:11:05] <Mateon1> I'm getting roughly 80KiB/s per aria2c thread on that format
[20:11:45] <Mateon1> And yes, the "(maybe throttled)" 5k f272 is in fact throttled.
[20:48:15] <thardin> haven'tt see anything like that with yt-dlp yet
