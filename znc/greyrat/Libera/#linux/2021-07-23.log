[03:23:36] <ayecee> sometimes it's best to leave that onion unpeeled.
[03:23:40] <acresearch> djph: hahaha    explanation number   what ?  5?
[03:24:05] <MrElendig> acresearch: you didn't really explain why you need to *run* the ancient kernel just to compile your userspace program
[03:24:06] <djph> how far back was it? guess i didn't go up enough lines
[03:24:26] <ayecee> his uni has a legacy supercomputer that uses centos 6, which uses 2.6.32 kernel
[03:24:28] <MrElendig> usually all you need (at worst) are the headers
[03:24:40] <MrElendig> and possibly some ancinet toolchain
[03:24:42] <ayecee> and for which he wants to compile software to run
[03:25:16] <acresearch> djph: summery --> supercomputer has old kernel, i have a new program that needs a supercomputer to run, trying to compile new program in old kernel in hopes it will work in the supercomptuer
[03:25:18] <MrElendig> (since many systems have glibc with kernel dep way newer than 2.6.32)
[03:25:41] <djph> acresearch: OK, so ... whoever wrote the application wrote it for the wrong kernel?
[03:25:52] <MrElendig> acresearch: as I hinted at, that *very* rarely requires actually running the ancient kernel
[03:25:56] <ayecee> well.. no
[03:26:04] <acresearch> djph: maybe,
[03:26:11] <uwharrie> it's not clear that the kernel is relevant so much as the outdated OS is
[03:26:22] <djph> acresearch: was the assignment "you must write for $version ?"
[03:26:30] <acresearch> MrElendig: i am not sure how to make work

[03:26:53] <acresearch> ok guys one moment ...   let me explain
[03:26:53] <ayecee> the old libraries, the old compiler, etc.
[03:26:56] <djph> (or more likely, a specific version of the C standard, e.g. C99)
[03:27:16] <uwharrie> the program is using C++11 features and the old compiler only supports up to C++0X
[03:27:47] <djph> if the author of the application wrote for C11, and the assignment was "write for C99" --> "$student, you have $time to rectify this, or you fail."
[03:28:18] <acresearch> this is the program i am talking about:   https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina/releases/tag/v1.2.0.dev3     here you can see it is available as a ready compiled option,   and the source code if you want to manually compile it in the github repo

[10:04:24] <Junior> Hello @yogoyo, i am trying to setup vacation responses using sendmai, dovecot , roundcube and the managesieve plugins.  I have installed roundcube, the plugin, defined rules, i connect the managesieve to the dovecot server and the rules are saved into the home of users. All seems fine but the filters are ignored and can't understand why. I have looked  into https://blog.lorenzbausch.de/2013/07/15/virtualmin-enable-sieve-for-dovecot-and-procmail/ and it does the same,
[10:04:26] <Junior> but for me it doesn't work and I don't understand why.

[16:22:22] <hingoanashi1209> if you have a specific suggestion that would be nice
[16:22:39] <BCMM> hingoanashi1209: you can just set the PS1 variable to anything you like. it's an environment variable, applicable only to the current shell
[16:22:44] <ayecee> hingoanashi1209: you might tweak your ssh_config to set the PS1 on the remote machine when logging in. a few options for this are discussed at https://superuser.com/questions/221001/pushing-my-ps1-prompt-over-ssh
[16:23:05] <BCMM> hingoanashi1209: you can change it in your bashrc, or have a special one just for when you ssh, etc. etc.
[16:23:27] <hingoanashi1209> yes but I once had a setting such that all remote cases (ssh) would show up in red and local would show in green without having to change it for each
[16:23:48] <Psi-Jack> of course, there's always the option to use Chrome instead of Firefox, because for some reason Firefox does seem to use more RAM and CPU than Chrome these days. heh
[16:23:51] <hingoanashi1209> oh BCMM that is what I want -- as special one just for when I ssh
[16:23:54] <hingoanashi1209> how would I do that?

[16:39:16] <BCMM> hingoanashi1209: is the obstacle here having to set up the remote machines individually?
[16:39:44] <hingoanashi1209> the problem is that I ssh into the same machines from multiple computers and don't want that setup on the other computers
[16:39:57] <TJ-> hingoanashi1209: use tmux? I have customised status line showing the remote name when using single monitor.
[16:40:12] <Psi-Jack> Personally, I use tmux locally and often times remotely as well. My tmux, however, shows me what host I'm connected to and what user. I also distribute my dotfiles to all systems I interact with via yadm, which allows me to setup things how I want and even have variences based on what distro, or OS it is.
[16:40:26] <TJ-> hingoanashi1209: you can even change the background colour which I find better
[16:40:26] <Psi-Jack> hingoanashi1209: You may not want to, but you should.

[18:29:49] <Psi-Jack> Check the chmod manpage on sticky bit
[18:29:57] <Psi-Jack> There's a whole section on it specifically.
[18:30:12] <hexnewbie> To be quite fair, on the spying topic, I've been tempted by the dark side when I last found all home directories on a server chowned to user 'joe' *while* I was investigating who filled the filesystem of the same server to 100%.
[18:30:12] <TomyWork> for directories it restricts deleting files from that directory

[18:31:23] <TomyWork> "For regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit." doesnt say anything about newer systems

[19:39:22] <BCMM> ^need to calculate it

[19:39:58] <prussian> kurahaupo: idk, I usually just format them with whatever I want out of the box.
[19:40:05] <BCMM> you can't mount /dev/sdb (the whole device); you have to mount /dev/sda1 (the actual filesystem) instead

[20:04:14] <wmorse> Greeting Linux people! I'd like to learn to "reset" name resolution on my system. I am running PopOs21.04 and after last update there has been weirdness with name resolution. internet/Internet is otherwise fine. The weirdness seems related to switching between my "at work" network, my home wifi, and my work network over VPN.  I am using a netExtender VPN client that does _something_ with setting for name resolution and routing. When it
[20:04:14] <wmorse> all breaks, I re-write by hand resolv.conf with google's nameservers, and run "systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service"

[20:04:43] <wmorse> That helps but I'd rather have a smarter way to reset things
[20:05:17] <BCMM> networker: e.g. root is on a squashfs, and you put the squashfs in an image within the fat32 filesystem that you are required to have for EFI boot, instead of in a second partition
[20:05:18] <Guest0> make an automatic shell script

[20:07:27] <wmorse> TJ: is there a way to ask remote DHCP to "resend" settings?
[20:07:31] <TJ-> wmorse: usually /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolve.conf where it'll set "nameserver 127.0.0.53" <-- the .53 is a clue that systemd-resolved is doing DNS

[20:36:50] <ayecee> it's really really unlikely to find a distro with just the tools you want, and not tools you don't want. they tend to target broader audiences.

[20:42:22] <rty> kuhilas: manjaro has i3wm edition. you said it worked. just use it?

[20:48:52] <TJ-> cold-booted to Windows then warm-rebooted to Linux  4) determine if the ACPI DSDT declares a specific version of Windows that Linux needs to pretend to be - for this see my workaround article at https://iam.tj/prototype/enhancements/Windows-acpi_osi.html
