[00:31:35] <earnestly> I'm finding it a little difficult to find information on why I might be seeing multiple errors from curl of: curl: (23) Failed writing received data to disk/application
[00:32:30] <earnestly> Is there anything that might be worth checking?  Permissions, etc

[00:38:11] *** Joins: jinmiaoluo (~Thunderbi@8.218.27.102)
[00:39:15] <earnestly> Yeah.  Okay it has to do with --create-dirs and --etag-compare/--etag-save.  If the directory doesn't exist, the etag will fail causing every other multiplexed connection to fail
[00:39:36] <earnestly> Hopefully what would happen instead is for curl to create that directory for the etag as well as for the output
[00:40:00] <earnestly> Or somehow not teardown the entire connection if one fails

[20:03:34] <bch> I'm using curl to do _connection_ setup (CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY), and wanting to keep the fd (and only the fd, as far as I can tell atm) for later use outside of curl -- is simply omitting curl_easy_cleanup() the indicated way to do this?

[23:15:13] <bch> if I didn't do the curl_easy_cleanup() it definitely leaks that structure (which I'd have to sit down and reaquaint self w/ to see its real size, what resources are (potentially) shared, etc)... but that's why I was heartened to see a CONNECT_ONLY reference in the cleanup code, but I haven't dug to its core to see if/how it'll do what I want. So a dup() w/ the cleanup seems to satisfy the situation -- I _was_ 
[23:15:19] <bch> worried about the action on the backing file obj (that the fd references) because my docs indicate its protected from close-on-exec, but necessarilly close(), but... my tests seem to work. Always something to learn
