[00:29:59] <since_> in math (not python) (A B)^T = B^T A^T
[00:30:20] <since_> thus (X Y^T)^T = (Y X^T)
[00:31:08] <since_> i.e. the result is (im math) the same result but transposed
[00:32:05] <since_> in matmul if Y and X are arrays you get something that should be identical but may be completely different to the math one in some cases
[00:32:28] <since_> (identical as in not even transposed i think)

[01:08:03] <theseb> A regular RNN can receive a set of inputs of ANY length.  However a bidirectional RNN only makes sense for a KNOWN length right?
[01:08:25] <theseb> (because you have to feed one of the two RNNs with the input sequence in reverse order!?)
[01:08:43] <theseb> .
[01:09:11] <theseb> i.e. you can talk about the output of 1 RNN input...but I don't think you can talk about the output of one input to a bidirectional RNN?

[21:23:57] <hodapp> the attention mechanism in transformers improved on a lot of drawbacks in LSTM
[21:28:56] <[itchyjunk]> theseb, if you're chasing latest and greatest sure
[21:29:21] <[itchyjunk]> I think you miss why attention is all you need if you don't at least look at why they came up with this shit
[21:29:29] <[itchyjunk]> Hm, i wonder if i know why..
[21:42:01] <HuntsMan> BERT is a NLP method, LSTM is a neural network layer, not really comparable ):
[21:43:45] <stefan-_> lessshaste, BERT was trained on masked language model, therefore you can put a mask token somewhere in the text and let BERT predict the token at that position
[21:44:06] <stefan-_> for next word prediction you can put the mask token at the end
[21:44:25] <mefistofeles> HuntsMan: I agree
[21:44:48] <stefan-_> note that GPT was trained on a classic language model task, so it should be more suitable for next word prediction

[21:50:23] <stefan-_> for sentiment analysis there is a nice paper which uses an LSTM and gets accuracy close to a BERT-based model: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04007v1

[21:56:20] <theseb> attention is to handle  loooong sequences practically yes?
[21:57:15] <HuntsMan> long term dependencies
[21:57:19] <theseb> stefan-_: for next word prediction...i think they just randomly try lots of guesses until one has a high language model probabilty?
[21:57:56] <theseb> HuntsMan: thanks
[22:07:38] <stefan-_> theseb, the model outputs a vector of token scores, i.e. the token probabilities
[22:07:56] <stefan-_> you can then for example take the one with the highest score, or sample from that distribution
[22:09:58] <pulseaudio> Can machine learning emulate personalities ?
[22:13:37] <hodapp> even a Markov chain can emulate personalities to some degree
[22:15:45] <pulseaudio> like can it study my answers and reply like me ?
[22:19:03] <hodapp> at a superficial level yes
[22:20:00] <pulseaudio> any applications which can do that ?
[22:39:48] <hodapp> question answering systems are a subfield of machine learning, but the effectiveness of what's out there depends a lot on what you actually want to do and how close it needs to be
[22:40:45] <pulseaudio> I want to have fun i guess !
[22:45:36] <Klinda> how to get a job in nvidia ai?
[22:45:53] <Klinda> how a work in ai looks like?
[22:49:17] <theseb> stefan-_: thanks..when people say 'sample the distribution'..does it mean randomly trying new words and seeing their probabilities?
[22:49:47] <mefistofeles> Klinda: it depends, I don't know about nvidia ai/dl but I have some friends that worked for facebook research and they said it was SO BORING
