[01:43:42] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> i'd say $40-50k if your housing expenses aren't whack is reasonable
[01:43:46] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> all depends on monthly expenses
[01:45:19] <A-KO> My recommended answer is go as cheap as you can go with the features you want or are willing to give up for a car. Cars are generally getting pricier, as far as new cars are concerned. So I'd probably recommend buying used ; although it's possible in some cases the overall out of pocket value is higher than new.
[01:45:44] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> i'd recommend not buying at all right now and wait a year so prices are back to normal

[01:46:02] <bloody> will be more than a year though probably before prices stabilize

[01:46:05] <bloody> probably 2-3 years
[01:46:21] <shakygator> just buy a 5-10k car that will last you 10+ years and save that money up instead of spending $900/mo on a car note

[08:57:02] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> Grow your virtual machine (VM) disks‚Äô capacity independently of the VM size you are using. You can attach more disk capacity per VM without having to upgrade to larger VM sizes or leveraging multiple VMs. For instance, you can now attach two 32 TiB data disks on the smallest B1 Azure VM to achieve total disks capacity of 64 TiB. Our largest VMs can now support up to 2 PiB of Disks Storage on a single VM. This provides a cost-effective solution

[15:24:52] <thegodsquirrel> ^^
[15:25:17] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> offer is by the company that does all our electrical work, they came on site and went over the equipment to size it up
[15:25:37] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> max rated power should be good for double what is currently in the rack
[15:25:58] <thegodsquirrel> Good to have some growing room
[15:26:30] <thegodsquirrel> and if you can offload the risk on a vendor if it is wrong or what not
[15:26:45] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> Jarp. I'm not too worried about sizing. If none of you are telling me to stay far away from this type/brand, that's good enough for me.
[15:27:01] <Oliber> also depends how your power is supplied - if you have two phases supplied, and a lot of your kit has 2 PSUs, we tend to go for 2 UPSes, one for each PSU/phase
[15:27:54] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, if redundant power sources were an option this would be solid advice
[15:28:11] <Oliber> the third phase should also be balanced, which your electrical installers should be able to help with
[15:28:12] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> interesting
[15:28:26] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> guess I could ask if that's an option
[15:29:15] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> is UPS defect a "frequent" occurrence?
[15:29:17] <thegodsquirrel> If they didn't offer it, you probably don't the option without them adding a service and doing more electrical work to run the lines
[15:29:44] <thegodsquirrel> I've had them be bad OOTB but not often
[15:30:08] <Oliber> splitting the inputs across phases is more protecting from an input failure, rather than the UPS
[15:30:37] <thegodsquirrel> batteries can be finicky but I have had (2) APCs for 5 plus years running without any issues in homeprod and at production sites
[15:30:40] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> Normally you offer 3 loops to the rack room

[15:31:44] <Oliber> it sounds like this is a single rack, so i'm expecting a single circuit/single phase on the dist boards
[15:31:50] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> Which preferably are independent
[15:32:01] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> Switch to DC power
[15:32:01] <riff-IRC> we ran a wide mix of voltages in our shop building

[15:32:24] <thegodsquirrel> Sounds like its a small shop, probably like most of the small clients our MSP had
[15:32:39] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> DC power is an option for switches and servers
[15:33:20] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> You fit a DC bar to the top of Ur rack and that runs all the balancing and usually takes 2-4 single phase inputs
[15:33:25] <riff-IRC> 33kV incomers from the poco, then 4160V for local distribution, 600/347 for heavy-duty motors and lighting, 480/277 for medium-duty motors and lighting, 240V for server equipment, 120V for wall power

[15:34:17] <riff-IRC> this was a generator shop out in West Texas
[15:34:22] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> 230, 460 50hz
[15:34:34] <riff-IRC> built and opened in 1979, demolished 2019

[15:35:15] * riff-IRC nods
[15:35:18] <baguettes> shakygator, you around?
[15:35:40] <riff-IRC> that shop gained a curse in 1988 that exposed itself in September 1989 as a switchgear fire
[15:35:57] <riff-IRC> It went down with the building in July 2019.
[15:37:03] <riff-IRC> In those 40 years, it had 7 major explosions or fires (or major events)- 1989, 1990, 1997, 2000, 2009, 2015, 2017, and 2019.
[15:37:08] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> @Hotness I assume servers and switches don't just take DC out of the box?
[15:38:04] <riff-IRC> 2017 is when I personally made the call to condemn the building if something major happened following a 2000MW arc flash that killed 2 and left one critically injured and permanently disabled.
[15:38:21] <Oliber> if you buy kit with DC PSUs, they take DC out of the box; but most people buy AC gear
[15:38:37] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> It's prolly AC stuff
[15:39:09] <riff-IRC> May 2019, another arc flash that injured 3. All traces of that building were gone by December of that year.

[21:30:30] <A-KO> AMD's is kind of dynamic.

[21:52:29] <fritzwastaken> I went over my girlfriends grans house the other day, and her gran made a cup of tea by putting the milk first, then the tea bag, then the boiling water. Insanity. My sister makes tea the normal way, but leaves the tea bag in the cup, while she drinks it. Edit* so apparently according to the comments, people who live in a hard water area, will get scum forming on their tea, if they go water first.
[21:52:31] <fritzwastaken> The method to make tea is obviously regional then. Also I should say that this post is a joke, and I don't actually care how people make tea. Some people in the comments are so angry lol

[23:15:16] <sintax> ptaav: could be worse. 
[23:15:24] <PublicWifi> connectwise isn't that bad its just a bit... much at first
[23:15:33] <sintax> could be using KACE
[23:15:39] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> or token ring üòâ
[23:15:41] <PublicWifi> fuckin KACE wow
[23:15:42] <sintax> ^^
[23:15:45] <signofzeta> yeah, I switched from AutoTask to ConnectWise.  Now it's second nature.
[23:15:48] <sintax> PublicWifi: yeah...
[23:15:56] <PublicWifi> KACE has some cool stuff but man its a bitch
[23:15:57] <sintax> i want a real rmm tool
[23:16:06] <thegodsquirrel> punch cards and mainframe only
[23:16:07] <sintax> PublicWifi: yeah. i do training on it the first week of november. 
[23:16:17] <ptaav> well we don't have the rmm plugin
[23:16:23] <sintax> dumb
[23:16:27] <ptaav> so we have a separate tool for it
[23:16:29] <sintax> i've used solarwinds and datto
[23:16:37] <sintax> liked both. prefer solarwinds. 
[23:16:39] <thegodsquirrel> ^^
[23:16:43] <mistiry> solarwinds is malware
[23:16:43] <vinrock> i was told to stay away from datto
[23:16:43] <thegodsquirrel> I liked SW
[23:16:50] <dragonfleas> solarwinds is dog
[23:16:51] <ptaav> then we rely on it tools for client documentation 
[23:16:59] <dragonfleas> if you want a breach install solarwinds
[23:16:59] <Alternity> solarwinds is great if you want your network hacked
[23:17:01] <vinrock> also dragonfleas didnt bite
[23:17:02] <dragonfleas> especially DPA
[23:17:03] <vinrock> :P
[23:17:05] <ptaav> solarwinds = russian spyware
[23:17:06] <dragonfleas> shit is a botnet
[23:17:13] <sintax> probably but it works lol
[23:17:19] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> only cause solarwinds was hacked by russia

[23:17:27] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> honestly dont underesmate russia
[23:17:29] <vinrock> thats why i was told to avoid datto
[23:17:32] <dragonfleas> oh god solarwinds sales people are another breed

[23:29:47] <vinrock> this year might have been the most profitable year in the company's 47 year history
[23:31:52] <ptaav> that's pretty typical for 2021
[23:32:07] <ptaav> companies all over are reporting record earnings
[23:32:32] <vinrock> we just bought a 100,000sq ft warehouse and filled it up instantly
[23:33:36] <ptaav> companies are still being stupid about hiring though
[23:34:16] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> vinrock: 100k sqft is freaking HUGE
[23:34:32] <ptaav> well some are cool, i got a $4000 sign on bonus
[23:35:06] <ptaav> but you're not seeing sign on bonuses in ads from fortune 1000 companies
[23:35:43] <ptaav> instead, they're dragging you through months long hiring processes just like its 2019 all over again
[23:36:20] <sintax> vinrock: the last warehouse i managed in was 640,000 sq feet.
[23:36:40] <vinrock> thats huge af lol

[23:53:05] <spiderman> you are the squatter vinrock lol
[23:53:16] <vinrock> if i hosted something id be a squatter
[23:53:24] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> vinrock: just let that trucking company have their domain
[23:53:35] <vinrock> why they dont exist any more
[23:53:38] <ptaav> host a "this is not bill burr" website
[23:53:38] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> there's no chance you're gonna snipe it
[23:53:45] <vinrock> their data shows they have 0 trucks now
[23:53:50] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> lol
[23:53:59] <spiderman> if you hosted something at least someone could contact you to take the domain, but you have whois privacy and no website, so how is anyone supposed to get the namefrom you 
[23:54:06] <vinrock> oh 
[23:54:08] <vinrock> thats a good idea
[23:54:15] <spiderman> you are worse than a squatter then
[23:54:19] <vinrock> hm
[23:54:21] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> spiderman: from the registrar
[23:54:25] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> or the registry
[23:54:33] *** Quits: Arlion (~Arlion@user/arlion) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[23:54:35] *** Quits: A-KO (A-KO@user/a-ko) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:54:42] <vinrock> well, if any of you know ol' billy bitch its tell him i got his domain
[23:54:44] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> and whois will always give contact info
[23:54:46] <spiderman> vinrock: you could set up a redirect to his site
[23:54:53] <vinrock> thats another good idea
[23:54:57] <vinrock> ill do that
[23:55:04] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> gandi is too expensive
[23:55:11] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> I use porkbun for all of my domains
[23:55:15] <vinrock> eh i dont have boatloads of domains so it aint bad
[23:55:20] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> namecheap isn't very good either
[23:55:27] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> i have 6 paid ones and like 40 free ones
[23:55:27] <spiderman> godaddy is great 
[23:55:31] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> that's why i use cf
[23:55:31] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> nope
[23:55:36] <spiderman> $3 for a year of kingcobrajfs.shop
[23:55:36] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> godaddy SUCKS
[23:55:39] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> namecheap is behind the curve for a lot
[23:55:45] <ptaav> unless i was making passive income, i'd hate managing a bunch of websites
[23:55:52] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> HurdyGurdyBurdy: cloudflare? huh?
[23:56:02] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> imagine changing nameservers on one of those domains
[23:56:14] <spiderman> it cost me $3 to set up my domain to sell counterfeit potion time glasses
[23:56:19] <spiderman> that is a fucking bargain
[23:56:33] <ptaav> how much do you make off of it?
[23:56:36] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> at least now you can register straight through cloudflare
[23:56:36] <spiderman> $0
[23:56:42] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> and not just transfer in
[23:56:52] <ptaav> that's a shitty deal
[23:57:10] <spiderman> ptaav: kingcobrajfs is a "lolcow", who is milked for laughs. I do this to trigger him on live-stream, not to make money.
[23:57:22] <ptaav> ah
[23:57:23] <spiderman> I just wanted him to think that his "fans" were buying my glass instead of his
[23:57:33] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> LOL
[23:57:42] <ptaav> got any links of him being triggered?
[23:57:47] <spiderman> bruh
[23:58:00] <spiderman> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7FgIKaBM3g&t=512s
[23:58:06] <spiderman> this is his magnum opus
[23:58:31] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> spiderman: good luck paying the $44.99 renewal fee for that
[23:58:45] <ptaav> what the hell?
[23:59:02] <ptaav> this guy has some developmental issue
[23:59:02] <spiderman> @sysadmin I used a privacy.com card that will deny any more charges
[23:59:16] <ptaav> like a disability
[23:59:20] <spiderman> yeah
[23:59:22] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> more kids getting obsessed with autistic ppl
