[05:11:51] <indigo> Lol, what happens when the government turns off the Internet
[05:12:04] <indigo> Take that, crypto nerds
[05:13:09] <manicennui> Nope. If they had used Ethereum, the Internet couldn't be shut off.
[05:13:16] <manicennui> Ethereum solves all.
[05:13:39] <manicennui> Can't turn off the electricity.
[05:13:47] <manicennui> Can't shoot people.
[05:15:32] <gwozniak> THE MARKET WILL SAVE US
[05:18:53] <manicennui> I almost understand why they believe this nonsense about banking, but I've never understood why they believe that blockchain solves all kinds of other problems that involve interaction with the real world.
[05:19:28] <manicennui> "You can't shoot me! Here is my blockchain verified contract that you agreed to!"
[05:21:19] <manicennui> Like does that guy from earlier think that the Taliban would not do exactly what they did because some cyber organization didn't agree to it?
[05:21:41] <gwozniak> I honestly don't know what the hell is going through the minds of such people
[05:21:48] <manicennui> A well-known example, intended for venture capital funding, was The DAO, which launched with $150 million in crowdfunding in June 2016, and was nearly immediately hacked and drained of US$50 million in cryptocurrency.[7]
[05:21:50] <manicennui> LOL?
[05:22:18] <manicennui> The hack was reversed in the following weeks, and the money restored, via a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain: the Ethereum miners and clients switched to the new fork.
[05:22:27] <manicennui> Like everyone agreed to switch?
[05:23:03] <goodger[m]> yep, the immutable blockchain was mutated by community action
[05:24:23] <goodger[m]> ethereum transactions are absolutely irreversible until they are reversed!
[05:26:50] <cb> TALIBAN SOLDIERS SURROUND THE COMMUNITY UNTIL THEY REVERT THE TRANSACTION
[05:27:59] <gwozniak> I find it stupefying that there is a large group of people who honestly believe that remembering everything is a good idea
[05:29:00] <cb> for some i kinda see why, both from the short term (fuck i need this file 5 years from now) and the long term (society no longer has this cultural artifact from someone who was no one then and important now)
[05:29:05] <manicennui> I just don't understand their thinking around blockchain and the real world.
[05:29:21] <cb> i just dont see blockchains will be useful for it tyho
[05:29:28] <manicennui> Decisions are only as solid as someone's ability to enforce them.
[05:40:16] <gwozniak> But that's why we should all have guns
[05:40:26] <gwozniak> I mean... it's obvious, right?

[06:19:59] <manicennui> I just watched Monsters of Man, which is basically a slasher flick, but with military robots in the jungle of SE Asia.
[06:20:08] <manicennui> The CGI was actually really good, but the writing was bad.

[06:35:17] <manicennui> At one point the robot picks up the skin from some guy's face, and I thought he was going to wear it.
[06:35:23] <manicennui> I was like, "Fuck yeah! Get weird movie!"
[06:35:25] <manicennui> But he didn't.

[07:13:25] <drakonis> its much easier to find intel hardware
[07:13:37] <drakonis> it should be possible to get a laptop with arc gpus

[23:49:07] <drakonis> its always the middle east ffs
[23:49:26] <manicennui> drakonis: Probably because the Middle East is the location of our most recent meddling.

[23:50:59] <drakonis> lol
[23:51:03] <drakonis> fuck the world trade center
[23:51:10] <manicennui> companion_cube: Neither did Iraq or Afghanistan.
[23:51:13] <drakonis> the CIA ruined an entire continent
[23:51:31] <companion_cube> manicennui: in the mind of the americans in 2001, didn't they?
[23:51:42] <manicennui> Only the ignorant.
[23:51:42] <drakonis> central america and latin america is entirely fucked by CIA meddling and we're still suffering because of it
[23:51:52] <manicennui> There was never any connection at all to Iraq.
[23:52:22] <manicennui> Some of those involved trained somewhere in Afghanistan with the Taliban I believe.
[23:52:39] <manicennui> I believe they also went to flight school in Florida.
