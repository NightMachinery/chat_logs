[00:41:42] <khanred> it's great

[11:54:02] <JakeSays> i thought about rewriting it
[11:54:23] <MatthiasVance> Because klipper has leaner frontends iirc
[11:54:38] <JakeSays> leaner frontends?
[12:08:55] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: What I (think I) see with Klipper is that you can customize it more, also on the gcode / settings level and there seems to be a more scientific approach?
[12:09:19] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: And you have some front ends that use the API to steer it, as opposed to OctoPrint shoving all the gcode through the plugin pipeline
[12:09:25] <MatthiasVance> So it can be a little bit faster?

[12:16:27] <MatthiasVance> Yes I was looking where I said that haha
[12:17:07] <MatthiasVance> My thinking is more, if you have a very good core product (let's assume that's Klipper) with a good API, then you can have a plethora of lean front ends on top of that. You have people that can write good backend code and then people making frontends for that :D
[12:18:34] <JakeSays> klipper is just a gcode interpreter
[12:18:57] <MatthiasVance> I see a little more logic in there than that

[19:27:13] <alguien> Guest79, depends on what's being selected. The LINQ above selects nothing from children. But sure, I appreciate that it will generate SQL that does.
[19:27:42] <Guest79> Hence the `...`s in the example.
[19:28:50] <Guest79> Either way you're going to be joining to children and so will be returned the corresponding parent for each.

[19:38:22] <alguien> Guest79, Depends on the `...`. Just because I'm joining in SQL doesn't mean I'm selecting from both sides. Whatever is selected is unique. Were selection to omit everything from children, you wouldn't get duplicate parents
[19:39:37] <alguien> Or am I wrong? *squints*
[19:40:01] *** Quits: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:41:18] <alguien> Yeah I seem to be wrong. So my initial question makes no sense.
[19:41:18] <Guest79> Well, in the example of `dbContext.Children.Select(p => p.Parent)`, you will be generating `select parent.* from children join parent on <whatever the defined join is>`
[19:42:01] <alguien> Makes sense (considering all the above)
[19:43:24] <Guest79> It's simply the fact you're going from Children -> Parent that results in the join
[19:43:51] <alguien> Guest79, no for some reason I thought duplicate results would be eliminated, but they are not
[19:44:56] <alguien> Maybe relational algebra can't return duplicate rows and that's why I thought that? I'm not sure, can't check now.
[19:45:09] <Guest79> Not without explicitly coding for it, no, because that would be very odd behaviour to have by default :)
[19:45:39] <alguien> Btw if what you wrote is the kind of SQL EFCore would generate, this means parents won't necessarily be in the same order as children, right? Because without a specified ORDER, it is (technically) arbitrary
[19:46:44] <Guest79> The order would match the results returned by the database
[19:47:34] <Guest79> So if you're interested in an order then yeah you'd want to specify

[19:58:28] <alguien> irwiss, I'm requiring IQueryable<Parent>.Distinct(). DISTINCT ON ("require children's parentId column to be unique") is not standard SQL as far as I know. As for the .Distinct variant that takes an IEqualityComparer, I don't think that's translatable (so, client-side only).
[19:59:26] <irwiss> i mean, in plain sql, there's no default unique requirement, so one row can refer to same parent as another row... if you want that you'll need to put extra effort even with plain sql
[19:59:40] <irwiss> that = unique parents i mean
[20:01:05] <irwiss> fwiw you could write raw sql to set unique in migration, but then you'll have to handle constraint failures on the app's side
[20:03:22] <alguien> irwiss, I appreciate you making it explicit.
[20:05:26] <Guest79> If you want your database to do the heavy lifting, you could look at something like `ctx.Children.Select(x => x.Parent).GroupBy(x => x.Id).Select(x => x.First())`
[20:05:46] <alguien> irwiss, I don't understand what you mean set unique in a migration using raw sql?
[20:07:14] <alguien> Guest79, I think .Distinct() will suffice (instead of the .GroupBy(id) + First)
[20:08:14] <Guest79> I'd check that the equality operation required for `Distinct` actually does what you want but if it does then yeah sure
[20:09:04] <Guest79> It also depends on how many results you're dealing with. I think `Distinct` will pull back everything from the database and do the distinct in memory.
[20:09:09] <alguien> Guest79, it's server-side .Distinct
[20:09:46] <Guest79> Awesome
[20:09:58] <Guest79> Just something to bear in mind for future queries then
[20:09:59] <alguien> and I reckon the DB can optimize it. The planner should be smart enough to know primary keys are unique
[20:11:04] <alguien> Wait... https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-5.0/breaking-changes#collection-distinct-groupby <- I never felt that I understood this change
[20:13:25] <alguien> I think that's because the second example is wrong
[20:14:03] <alguien> And that it doesn't apply to my thing in any case because I only have children, I don't have grandchildren

[21:11:06] <DevJohnC> does a try { } finally { } block come with any innate performance penalty? I know exceptions are expensive, but does try-finally (no catch) have any perf impact?

[21:14:00] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: there's some "performance penalty" in the form of that methods containing EH are not eligible for inlining and they're a bit larger, thus less efficient on the cache and EH might impact enregistration ability of the JIT but other than that, no
[21:15:05] <DevJohnC> so pretty much anywhere but a perf critical hot path it's acceptable to have it
[21:15:13] <biberu> DevJohnC: it's what usings compile too, if that helps alleviate fear
[21:15:20] <biberu> to*
[21:18:55] <biberu> DevJohnC: i'd guess that allocating the resource that should be cleaned up is the more expensive part of it
[21:19:40] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: btw. even if you have a catch, there's no performance penalty unless an exception actually happens, then the costs appear when the stack is being walked, looking for possible exception handlers, executing their filter clause followed by unwinding the stack, executing any finally blocks on the way until the previously found catch clause is reached or the program will be terminated
[21:20:14] <DevJohnC> gotcha, good to know :)
[21:20:16] <DevJohnC> thanks :)
[21:22:47] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: btw. if i remember correctly, that "enregistration limitation" is something like any variable that is being used in the finally block must be spilled to the stack

[23:20:59] <GetShwifty> and those frameworks and the frameworks they build on are built for 'websites'/webapps where as ms honestly i think all this time has pegged blazor more as a "Windows App Store Framework"

[23:52:27] <_genuser_> it used to be russians as villains all the time.
[23:52:41] <Nasp> The new doctor who sucks as much as the previous one
[23:52:45] <_genuser_> then 2000-2010/2015 it was muslim baddies.
[23:52:52] <_genuser_> now it's America that's the baddie in all movies.
[23:53:39] <_genuser_> meanwhile short actors like robert deniro go on stage and rant about f this president or that president. And you never see them ever again. Not even in any real activism to even fix california.
[23:54:13] <JakeSays> ki9a: got yer permit, did ya?
[23:54:13] <GetShwifty> honestly the writers hurt Capaldi's career too
[23:54:17] <GetShwifty> they did not know how to write for him
[23:54:31] <_genuser_> I just think of it as the movies. movies made for other people. for people in the same echo chamber as the producers.
[23:55:07] *** Joins: kagevf (~jfh@ip68-108-33-76.lv.lv.cox.net)
[23:55:09] <_genuser_> it's like JakeSays making a movie about 3d printers. The whole movie the hero spends on a quest to get the best printer nozzle from some mountain, while saying My Precious every few minutes.

[23:58:35] <GetShwifty> it astonishes me
[23:58:37] <GetShwifty> lol
[23:58:41] <_genuser_> judging a channel by the color of the hair of the producer?
[23:58:52] <JakeSays> i like her hair
[23:58:59] <GetShwifty> i dont give a shit about her hair
[23:59:00] <JakeSays> i'd kickstart her anyday
[23:59:08] <GetShwifty> though she is cute and her hair works for her
[23:59:13] <_genuser_> it's just the purple hair and such people tend to get upset very fast.
[23:59:14] <GetShwifty> but god damn the detail that she gets on stuff
[23:59:19] <ki9a> JakeSays: yep! permit is in
[23:59:22] <GetShwifty> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WXiJOhrHoI
[23:59:23] <_genuser_> the other day somebody in here said they were triggered by what I said.
[23:59:40] <_genuser_> I'm baffled that a grown man would admit to being triggered. instead of getting a handle on their emotions.
[23:59:45] <JakeSays> _genuser_: he has just the right amount of tint
[23:59:57] <JakeSays> among other positive attributes
