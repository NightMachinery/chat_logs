[01:11:50] <Brekkjern> I hate "magic" code
[01:12:40] <gwozniak> As do I, but I hate it less when it comes with a long explanation
[01:14:49] <Brekkjern> This part is just supposed to "work" but since there are 3 layers of magic in between it just won't
[01:15:04] <Brekkjern> I'm probably doing something wrong, but since the error could be anywhere in the observable universe...
[01:17:33] <gwozniak> I suppose if it comes with an explanation, it's not magic anymore though
[01:29:39] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:30:21] <indigo> I hate reflection more than magic code
[02:30:32] <indigo> At least magic code is somewhat self contained
[02:37:14] <goodger> gwozniak: he is, thanks
[02:37:29] <goodger> he defecated today for the first time since friday

[02:52:28] <Brekkjern> The cone of shame!
[02:52:32] <goodger> here is a photo of arie wearing the jumbo cone we installed because he defeated the normal cone
[02:52:40] <goodger> I think he looks like a radio telescope with a tail
[02:55:40] <Brekkjern> I bet it boosts the volume when he meows?
[02:55:50] <goodger> a little
[02:55:55] <goodger> he's pretty directional anyway
[03:22:39] <gwozniak> goodger: what a great pic :)
[03:23:55] <gwozniak> My previous cat, when she was diagnosed with diabetes, had an enema at the vet who described her as "remarkably backed up" and was fairly certain she would now feel a lot better
[03:24:15] <goodger> aw
[03:24:55] <goodger> arie has just been holding it in because he greatly prefers going somewhere outside to evacuate himself
[03:25:33] <goodger> he finds the cat flap's failure to open for him most perplexing
[04:02:32] <Brekkjern> Why the fuck is this code that was written for a guide in 2015 designed for Py2?
[04:05:40] <gwozniak> And I'm glad that arie is doing well
[04:05:51] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: that is... a good question

[04:18:38] <buttsbot> Twitter - SenWhitehouse - This long-delayed answer confirms how badly we were spun by Director Wray and the FBI in the Kavanaugh background investigation and hearing. https://t.co/x24NcE3KtC
[04:18:47] <martian67> FBI  tip line received “over 4,500 tips, including phone calls and electronic submissions.” The FBI apparently pursued none of these tips. Instead, by the FBI’s own account, it merely “provided all relevant tips” to Trump’s Office of White House Counsel, the very office that had constrained and directed the limited investigation.

[17:36:01] <gwozniak> gerikson: yes, the "it was simpler back then" is so demonstrably false that you know it will persist forever
[17:36:33] <gwozniak> I'm about to get back into firing up those old systems and I know it will be a slog because by god they suck
[17:42:15] <gerikson> I doubt people are nostalgic for 286's
[17:50:59] <goodger> I am pretty glad to have missed the whole DOS era
[17:54:41] <gerikson> same
[17:54:48] <gerikson> I started on Win 3.1
[17:55:13] <goodger> I don't think that counts :P
[17:55:20] <gwozniak> I didn't use an x86 machine seriously until just before the Win95 era
[17:55:34] <gwozniak> But technically, I started on Win 3.1 as well
[17:55:44] <gerikson> my first PC was a 386 w/ 2MB memory and no math coprocessor
[17:56:03] <goodger> I started on windows 95, a pentium 75 with 8MB RAM
[17:56:20] <goodger> protected memory and everything
[17:56:28] <gerikson> oooh fancy
[17:56:33] <gerikson> I used to dream about Pentiums
[17:56:41] <gwozniak> P100, similar to goodger's setup
[17:57:04] <gwozniak> Had a C64 long before that
[17:57:34] <gerikson> I'm so old
[17:57:36] <goodger> though the first computer I personally owned was a BBC B
[17:59:07] <gwozniak> Coleco Adam was mine. We won it in a contest
[17:59:08] <ngoldbaum> first home computer was a tandy 486 purchased from radioshack
[17:59:26] <gwozniak> That Adam would have been around 1984, I think

[17:59:51] <goodger> D O S
[18:00:00] <gwozniak> Wasn't that the best?!?
[18:00:19] <gwozniak> You had so much control over the machine because you were so close to it
[18:01:07] <gwozniak> TIE Fighter was a pretty great game, tho
