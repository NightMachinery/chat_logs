[00:03:01] <artok> bind mounting on node usually introduces problems with host and container runtimes, so I'd suggest clearing out host runtimes out of the way

[00:45:08] <gamara> you are exactly right lol
[00:45:11] <gamara> that is how I feel
[00:45:35] <gamara> So would I just write a script that runs that command and builds my docker compose setup
[00:46:31] <tabakhase> nothing rly complicated in it in the end, but some kind of "A B and C didnt make any sense, but after hitting D i get it" situations where "starting with D instead" would have made it even worse :D

[00:48:47] <tabakhase> gamara "whats the right setup" also depends a lot on what you actually want it todo - if you just want the public/ folder / build output in the end, and "use docker instead of npm on your host" its a different storry from "serving that webpack from a contianer"
[00:49:24] <tabakhase> say, dropping it into a nginx image as actual result
[00:50:18] <gamara> I have a nginix image that is serving the static files from client/public, I just want to build my project into client/public when I run docker-compose
[00:50:24] <c10l> any way to create unused networks via a compose file?
[00:50:40] <tabakhase> c10l define unused?
[00:50:52] <c10l> not used by any services in the same compose file
[00:51:00] *** Joins: NIXKnight (~NIXKnight@198.98.57.76)
[00:51:07] <c10l> basically I want to create some networks centrally but use them in other compose files
[00:51:31] <tabakhase> c10l what happens when you just put em in? to my understanding it isnt filterd by "actually used" or such...
[00:52:20] <tabakhase> (and even if, those "docker network create" commands you have to run _once_ in the whole lifetime of the host uh...
[00:53:18] <c10l> tabakhase: WARNING: Some networks were defined but are not used by any service: <network_name>
[00:53:22] <c10l> and it doesn't get created
[00:53:31] <tabakhase> c10l usually the issue is more "not to have other compose files try to kill that network" - and here defining the network as "external: true" comes in the play (say to hook up 3 compose stacks to the same shared traefik ingress)
[00:54:10] <c10l> sure I can script it up but I'd rather have it declared
[00:55:00] <c10l> I have "external: true" for the reverse proxy but I also need some macvlan networks to put some containers in their own VLANs.
[00:55:15] <c10l> some of those services/containers live in separate compose files
[00:56:01] <tabakhase> gamara in that case, that nginx should be part of that dockerfile ;-) - another FROM nginx on the end, and then COPY --from=0 /home/node... /var/www/... ((i think from=0 is first stage, may be =1, or you can change your first FROM to "FROM node:latest AS builder" and then "COPY --from=builder ...."
[00:56:25] <tabakhase> keyword, multistage docker build - if you wanne throw it in the googles
[00:56:42] <gamara> thank you so much tabakhase you are the best
[00:59:13] <tabakhase> c10l so... ya kinda trying to centralize networks even thos THIS composefile doesnt have anything todo with it, to have stacks A, B, C, D - and networkSetup only in A, but the serivce for it is only in D?

[01:09:11] <c10l> kind of a stupid limitation IMO. I have declared the network, just create it and I'll use it when and how I want.
[01:10:03] <c10l> for now I've commented out the dummy service and "up --remove-orphans"

[01:22:09] <artok> warning vs error
[01:29:37] <tabakhase> c10l maybe mixing both, making a "networks compose file" with only dummy services in it (that just flare up once when networks were changed/deployed) be somewhat better? (("up" will always trigger, restart-policy is more about "after it ended" / on system reboots and such))

[19:32:54] <anchovy> hi. I'm doing ARG X=y / FROM ${X}/moocows but ${X} resolves to an empty string. what am Id oing wrong? I'm not passing --build-arg to docker build. I want to use the default in the Dockerfile I'm making unless I override on the docker build command line

[20:05:47] <geirha> unable to reproduce it. I tried your exact example and it tries to grab docker.io/y/moocows as expected; it's clearly using the default value "y"
