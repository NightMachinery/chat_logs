[00:12:12] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/53BTs4/1 I view-source'd an email I received, and stripped out all the `<[^<>]*>` from it. This is what I was left with. I'm trying to now replace 2+ whitespace with a single space, but there are large chunks where it's not matching.
[00:13:15] <OnlineCop> If I search for `\s`, many of the spaces are found in this "whitespace" section. If I search for `\S`, the _same_ spaces are found in this "whitespace" section (after the text "Don't miss this top streams" and before "My Account".
[00:13:32] <OnlineCop> What ARE those non-whitespace characters that it's stopping at?
[00:17:42] <OnlineCop> Hmm. Searching for `(\S)\s` yields matches with Group 1 showing `U+200C`. What a strange non-whitespace (non-visible) character.
[00:18:39] <OnlineCop> "Zero-width non-joiner". Ick.

[16:20:30] <re101-goat-93> yes, what do I do?
[16:21:29] <JohnDoe2_> re101-goat-93 anything other than using regex to replace html
[16:21:48] <re101-goat-93> I find RegEx easy
[16:21:56] <JohnDoe2_> clearly you need help with it, so I disagree
[16:22:41] <re101-goat-93> it is easier than the word doc to html conversion
[16:23:06] <JohnDoe2_> word is not an HTML editor, you're using the wrong tool, again 
[16:23:14] <re101-goat-93> pls take a look: https://regex101.com/r/aTUQg5/1
[16:23:19] <JohnDoe2_> try Visual Studio Code
[16:23:49] <JohnDoe2_> I'm not willing to spend time on that task re101-goat-93, I'm sorry. If someone else here is willing to, they'll chime in
[16:25:36] <JohnDoe2_> just FYI, if you use Visual Studio Code it will scream at you if you don't have matching closing tags and other such helpful hints. So you can actually do it yourself without waiting on people to write regexes for you
[16:26:13] <re101-goat-93> never used it
[16:26:37] <re101-goat-93> never tried it
[16:26:54] <JohnDoe2_> think of it like Microsoft Word, but actually made for editing code like HTML/CSS which is what you have
[16:27:21] <JohnDoe2_> re101-goat-93 https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html
[16:30:58] <re101-goat-93> it seems like I'll have to edit files individually with that but Notepad++ replaces everything in multiple files all at once
[16:32:02] <JohnDoe2_> it can also replace stuff in multiple files
[16:32:19] <re101-goat-93> Ok, pls tell me how
[16:32:43] <JohnDoe2_> I would assume Edit -> Find in Files or Replace in Files /
[16:34:31] <re101-goat-93> I presume I have to download it, run it and when it's open, I shud  Edit -> Find in Files or Replace in Files /?
[16:34:50] <JohnDoe2_> yup
[16:41:18] <re101-goat-93> Guys, JohnDoe2_ has been nice and helpful but pls tell me how to tweak this RegEx so that after replacement, the `<br>` tags, zxcvb and the "-" (dash/hyphen) on the next line shud disappear: https://regex101.com/r/aTUQg5/1
[16:41:40] <re101-goat-93> .....and what do I put in the "replace" field?
[16:44:45] <Me-me> I can understand that it's frustration to have a solution in mind and be told that it shouldn't work, so people won't help you. But it really isn't a good tool for this. Try a proper parser. Something made for HTML.
[16:46:26] <re101-goat-93> I understand what you're saying but I'll have to learn something new. This regEx seems so tantalizingly close to a solution
[16:46:37] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[16:47:39] <Me-me> I get it. I've been there before. But despite seeming close, it's actually not. HTML doesn't follow consistent formatting throughout - to properly run a regex on it, you would need to create a fully comprehensive parser in regex first.
[16:47:59] <Me-me> We even have this command to the common question of using HTML on regex:
[16:48:00] <Me-me> !html
[16:48:00] <perlbot> Do NOT regex HTML/XML/JSON! Instead, consider using the appropriate parser in your programming language of choice. (http://bit.ly/1G8p6VH)
[16:48:35] <Me-me> The link will take you to a rant given by someone who desperately wanted to have people stop asking about regex on HTML :P because even if it is technically possible, it will in fact be easier to learn that other tool.
[16:49:25] <re101-goat-93> OK, +Me-me but at least can you give me a link to read about creating RegExes?

[16:49:56] <re101-goat-93> Will those work on Notepad++?
[16:50:16] <Me-me> Notepad uses PCRE, with one or two small bugs. So yes.

[21:59:21] <MrByte> re101-goat-69: think it does what you need https://regex101.com/r/rD7bbX/1
[22:02:44] <re101-goat-69> Nope MrByte
[22:03:01] <MrByte> hum... what is wrong?
[22:03:14] <re101-goat-69> It did not remove or replace anything
[22:03:53] <MrByte> 0did you see in the substitution field the $1 and $2?
[22:04:06] <MrByte> those are the fields to be replaced
[22:04:12] <MrByte> with the strings you need
[22:05:02] <MrByte> those are the groups
[22:05:13] <re101-goat-69> yes I get it
[22:08:11] <re101-goat-69> I want this to come after replacement, the text (blah bleeh bloh bluh) shud remain, the zxcvb and the "-" hyphen/dash should be replaced and some HTML code added after every: `<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><span style="color: rgb\(0, 0, 0\);

[22:08:12] <re101-goat-69> 0\); font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">TEXT</span></td></tr></tbody></table>`
[22:09:05] <re101-goat-69> the TEXT I have typed in Caps. I want the HTML to be added before and after that
[22:11:11] <MrByte> I am confused you mean you want to insert those html code after the </p>?
[22:11:16] <re101-goat-69> If I use just $2, the </p> remains as it should
[22:11:32] <re101-goat-69> yes
[22:11:39] <MrByte> ok, let me try
[22:17:01] <re101-goat-69> I have spent some 3 days trying to figure out a solution and finally came here. Pls help
[22:18:05] <re101-goat-69> I was here earlier in the day but did not get help
[22:18:28] <MrByte> I am still learning, I am trying to use the ?= positive lookbehind to capture after the </p> but this is breaking, but shouldn't be hard to make it work
[22:18:59] <MrByte> give more a few minutes
[22:24:21] <MrByte> ho it was failing because Go do not support lookbehind
[22:24:46] <MrByte> using python it seems to work, try this -> https://regex101.com/r/oPSp3Z/1
[22:26:09] <MrByte> this is wrong I think, this is replacing the $1 group after </p> as well
[22:26:34] <re101-goat-69> it says no occurence found, your earlier RegEx at least found it
[22:28:10] <MrByte> it finds
[22:28:16] <MrByte> try to refresh your page
[22:28:41] <MrByte> https://regex101.com/r/oPSp3Z/1
[22:32:32] <re101-goat-69> yes, both find what they shud, but after replacement, the original text disappears
[22:33:03] <re101-goat-69> the blah bleeh bloh bluh (text) shud remain
[22:33:48] <re101-goat-69> Don't give up on me
[22:34:24] <re101-goat-69> pls try
[22:34:31] <re101-goat-69> I'll wait
[22:34:40] <MrByte> calm down dude, no drama I will try
[22:34:48] <MrByte> but I see the blah bleeh
[22:34:52] <MrByte> remains
[22:34:56] <re101-goat-69> OK, thanks
[22:34:59] <MrByte> will try to change the approach 
[22:35:16] <re101-goat-69> what did you put in the replace field?
[22:36:26] <re101-goat-69> I put this: `<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><span style="color: rgb\(0, 0, 0\); font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px;
[22:36:27] <re101-goat-69> text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">-</span></td><td align="left" valign="top"><span style="color: rgb\(0, 0, 0\); font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent:
[22:36:27] <re101-goat-69> 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">$1$2</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>`
[22:36:41] <MrByte> I think the problem is the | or condition 
[22:36:47] <MrByte> will use this
[22:36:54] <MrByte> to test
[22:37:56] <re101-goat-69> No, it worked fine
[22:38:10] <re101-goat-69> I'd made a small mistake
[22:38:31] <re101-goat-69> instead of $1, it wa s just 1
[22:38:38] <re101-goat-69> I corrected it now
[22:38:48] <re101-goat-69> and it is working fine
[22:38:52] <re101-goat-69> Thanks
[22:39:39] <MrByte> ho cool
[22:39:56] <re101-goat-69> wait a second, it keeps the zxcvb and removes the text (blah, bleeh, bloh, bluh)
[22:40:10] <re101-goat-69> Sorry
[22:40:19] <MrByte> I think this is wrong yet
[22:41:07] <MrByte> this is putting the first group $1 in front of </p> as well
[22:41:12] <MrByte> should be only the group2
[22:41:18] <re101-goat-69> yes,  the zxcvb should go and the text (blah, bleeh, bloh, bluh) should remain
[22:42:08] <re101-goat-69> I'm waiting 4 a link, after you try sometging
[22:42:33] <re101-goat-69> I couldn't figure out myself
[22:46:02] <re101-goat-69> This finds what I want: `(?s)(?<=\Kzxcvb)([^-\r]*)(.*?) *(?=</span)` but the replacement is a problem
[22:46:27] <re101-goat-69> the "-" hyphen/dash remains
[22:46:43] <re101-goat-69> after replacement
[22:58:58] <re101-goat-69> This finds everything: `(?s)(?<=\Kzxcvb)|(?<=-)(.*?) *(?=</span)`
[22:59:12] <MrByte> so did it work?
[22:59:14] <re101-goat-69> ...but the replacement is a problem
[22:59:18] <MrByte> ho ok
[22:59:29] <re101-goat-69> the zxcvb remains
[23:02:09] <re101-goat-69> sorry, the zxcvb vanished but the "-" remains
[23:04:09] <re101-goat-69> FYI, I used $0 only in the replace field with the HTML codes on either side, but the the "-" remains (at the start of the line)
[23:10:17] <MrByte> sorry man I dunno, the closest I could get is with this (zxcvb|-)|(?<=</p>)
[23:10:29] <MrByte> but it puts the first group after </p>
[23:10:36] <MrByte> dunno how to avoid this
[23:11:01] <MrByte> there are many people here that really know how to do it easily, just wait
[23:11:05] <MrByte> and someone should help
