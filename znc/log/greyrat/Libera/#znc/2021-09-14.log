[02:50:57] <ekun> I have a problem using this mobile app "IRC for Android" when I attach to ZNC it shows the buffer as numbers, any idea?
[02:59:11] <knolle> use a client that doesn't
[03:02:18] <DarthGandalf> ekun: what do you mean by that?
[03:02:22] <DarthGandalf> numbers
[03:02:29] <MetaNova> ekun: screenshot?
[03:02:36] <knolle> (just to be clear, we're talking channel names, right?)
[03:03:19] <MetaNova> on a small enough screen, the timestamps prefixed by lack of server-time might take up most of the screen
[03:03:48] <MetaNova> would need to actually see what their playback looks like, though
[03:05:19] <ekun> sec I will try a screenshot 
[03:08:18] <ekun> https://gyazo.com/eae13c0472722c0a346663c94be94bea
[03:09:50] <MetaNova> yeah, lack of server-time
[03:11:07] <DarthGandalf> MetaNova: why such numbers though?
[03:11:27] <DarthGandalf> it would be a timestamp prepended
[03:11:32] <DarthGandalf> not replacing the whole message
[03:11:35] <MetaNova> I think they're truncated timestamps
[03:11:47] <MetaNova> combined with the client doing some weird formatting
[03:16:34] <ekun> emailed the app dev see if he knows a solution, but he claims it works fine for him

[03:28:31] <BtbN> That can normally only happen if the client announced server-time support, but then does not actually parse it?
[03:30:05] <MetaNova> no
[03:30:19] <MetaNova> it also happens when the client supports it, but doesn't negotiate server-time, or simply doesn't support it
[03:31:28] <BtbN> Hm? Without negotiating it, ZNC should not send that style timestamps, should it?
[03:31:44] <MetaNova> between client <-> ZNC
[03:31:47] <BtbN> yes
