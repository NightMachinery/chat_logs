[03:43:02] <FromDiscord> <dan> but it really is a pain to make it comply to the restrictions i have on the build ... cant even really guarantee it uses the same gcc out of the different ones i have installed on the command line

[06:31:34] <FromDiscord> <dan> now that i can answer without knowing too much about nim
[06:32:04] <FromDiscord> <dan> nim does have a garbage collector and any language can be memory safe
[06:32:28] <FromDiscord> <dan> really depends on your code
[06:41:21] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Well rust uses a similar memory management method to Nim's Arc, which is what they mean by "no GC" afaik
[06:41:49] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> So if you use the strict not nil annotation you can get similar memory safety
[06:42:38] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Remember that rust doesnt give nil, so just by making sure you cannot have nil you get a fair bit of memory safety

[09:14:59] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But that can be easily fixed
[09:22:36] <FromDiscord> <bung87 (Bung)> Okay
[09:28:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @ElegantBeef "So nil aside you": technically only arc, not orc
[09:54:22] <nixfreak_nim[m]> using tables , how do you get back only one key or value 
[09:55:41] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> What do you mean?
[09:56:54] <nixfreak_nim[m]> so I iterate over all the keys or values or both but how can I just show one key or one value 
[09:57:56] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> do the first then put a break after, can always make a proc to do it for you
[09:58:59] <nixfreak_nim[m]> I can't just echo the int of a value ? 
[09:59:12] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> You can
[09:59:29] <nixfreak_nim[m]> echo x["Cat"]
[09:59:29] <nixfreak_nim[m]> 10
[09:59:39] <nixfreak_nim[m]> echo x(10) ? 
[10:00:00] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Oh you want to get the key from the value?
[10:00:09] <nixfreak_nim[m]> yes
[10:00:17] <nixfreak_nim[m]> sorry had it backwards 
[10:00:51] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> You cant really, you can get a list of all keys with that value but not a specific key
[10:01:13] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> So if you just want the first you can just iterate over find the value that's the same and break
[10:02:25] <nixfreak_nim[m]> ahh ok ,I was looking over the tables section and didn't see a way but that makes sense 
[10:02:59] <nixfreak_nim[m]> so iterate over all then use an if statement for the first one then break 
[10:03:24] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3tu4 for an example of what i'd do, though preferablly make it a proc instead of course
[10:06:31] <nixfreak_nim[m]> ok how would you do it if you didn't know the key?
[10:06:46] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> That example doesnt know the key
[10:07:07] <nixfreak_nim[m]> ok either one then , the value or the key 
[10:07:28] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> I dont follow, if you have the key you can get the value, if you have the value you can only get a possible key
[10:07:37] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> It's only associative key -> value
[10:07:48] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> There is no connection from value to key
[10:08:17] <nixfreak_nim[m]> oh so not like an array , there is no index with key,value 
[10:08:36] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Well thatâ€™s not how tables work
[10:09:02] <nixfreak_nim[m]> I get it , I didn't think there was just curious
[10:09:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In arrays you cannot set arbitrary keys like in tables
[10:09:53] <nixfreak_nim[m]> so not like python dicts then 
[10:10:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Python dictionaries cannot do what you say either
[10:10:40] <FromDiscord> <Rika> You can always use two tables with the value and key reversed in one of them
[10:11:08] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> The same issue arises though you can have 200 `10`s and have a list of keys
[10:11:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> That is only if the value is hashable like the key
[10:11:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> And yes
[10:11:25] <FromDiscord> <Rika> If the value is unique to the key
[10:12:05] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Though Nim tables have an interesting feature where a key can have more than one value
[10:12:05] <nixfreak_nim[m]> d.iterkeys().next()
[10:12:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @nixfreak_nim "d.iterkeys().next()": Youâ€™re iterating through the keys still, which is O(n)
[10:12:39] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Accesses for dictionaries are typically constant time
[10:13:23] <FromDiscord> <Rika> You will not have fun trying to search for a key with a certain value in a dictionary with a few hundred thousand or a million entries
[10:13:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> And the issue of non unique values still exists
[10:14:20] <nixfreak_nim[m]> Sorry element crashed on sway
[10:15:02] <nixfreak_nim[m]> ok I understand , thanks

[10:57:58] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Wouldnt a sharedptr just be equivlent to any GC'd method?
[10:58:29] <FromDiscord> <checkersai> Well it's a reference counted pointer so `arc` is the most similar
[11:00:32] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> I'll dumbly say sure then
[11:05:22] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Well I assume it is because arc doesnâ€™t use thread local heaps anymore right?

[18:24:23] <FromDiscord> <deech> It's so odd that this also segfaults: `var c: cstring; assert c[0] == '\0'`. I would expect the default `cstring` to at least be a null terminator.
[18:27:19] <FromDiscord> <deech> More shenanigans: `var c: cstring; echo c.len; assert c[0] == '\0';` outputs `0` and segfaults, `var c: cstring = ""; echo c.len; assert c[0] == '\0';` outputs `0` and doesn't segfault. Yeah this is just broken.
[18:27:33] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> no, default `cstring` is `NULL` in C
[18:27:43] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So why should it have null terminator
[18:28:26] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> If you init it with `""` then it has null terminator
[18:28:45] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And it makes perfect sense, since you default-init pointer with an expression
[18:28:45] <FromDiscord> <deech> `len` of a default `NULL` cstring and `len` with empty cstring have the same value, `0`.
[18:29:02] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I bet `strlen` does the same
[18:29:20] <FromDiscord> <deech> And if the default value is `NULL` like in C it should behave like `char` in other cases too (like `option`).

[22:45:39] <FromDiscord> <checkersai> I'm a little bit confused, is `lent T` necessary when large `T`'s are already converted to pointers?
[22:45:51] <FromDiscord> <checkersai> Or am I misunderstanding something
[22:49:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `lent` is an immutable view, so if your data is already in form of a pointer (which is also can be considered a view) then you probably don't need this

[23:36:26] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> why do you use cstring in the first place?
[23:36:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I mean wrapping it in `Option` etc.
[23:36:55] <arkanoid> just compiler nim from source for the first time. Everything went fine, I'm just curious about the steps. What is "https://github.com/nim-lang/csources_v1", what is the meaning of iteration 1 2 and 3?
[23:37:15] <FromDiscord> <leorize> i think the point is that cstring is too magical while being unsafe
[23:37:45] <FromDiscord> <leorize> but that probably won't change until @Araq finally figured out how views should work
[23:37:54] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> to me `cstring` is approximately in the same area as `pointer`
[23:38:02] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> stuff for interop, don't touch otherwise
[23:38:16] <FromDiscord> <leorize> it's not getting that support from the compiler
[23:38:33] <FromDiscord> <leorize> the compiler treats it as perfectly safe and that's where trouble lies
[23:39:07] <FromDiscord> <carmysilna> In reply to @arkanoid "just compiler nim from": I think the three iterations are meant to check that compiling nim with number 0 (before change version of nim compiler) produces the same executable as compiling nim with the compiled version (number 1) and so on.
[23:39:58] <FromDiscord> <carmysilna> nim1 is the compiler compiled with nim0, nim2 is the compiler compiled with nim1,  and nim3 is the compiler compiled with nim3, and the script checks to make sure each executable is the same
[23:40:16] <FromDiscord> <leorize> iirc that check was removed
[23:40:20] <FromDiscord> <leorize> did it return?
[23:40:51] <arkanoid> well, I got "executables are equal: SUCCESS!" at the end of third iteration
[23:41:33] <arkanoid> how is possible that the binary produced by nim < 1.0 is equal to latest nim? It it mean logically equivalent and not binary equivalent?
[23:41:52] <FromDiscord> <leorize> it's only comparing iteration #2 and #3
[23:43:03] <arkanoid> ok
[23:44:28] <arkanoid> I was expecting nimlint https://github.com/nim-dev/nimlint , is this project available?
