[00:45:53] <mattb0ne> lol
[00:48:01] <mattb0ne> ok what is the first thing to check if you have a networking problem
[00:48:23] <somiaj> so this is an XY problem
[00:48:32] <somiaj> anyways, is this a fresh install?
[00:48:53] <mattb0ne> so I am trying to establish a connection to a SBC that is connected via ethernet cord ( through a router at the moment but I have tried direct connection)
[00:48:56] <mattb0ne> yes fresh install
[00:49:02] <mattb0ne> worked fine under buster
[00:49:09] <mattb0ne> i have internet access
[00:49:33] <mattb0ne> so something is working but I never get a connection establish message and I cannot connect to the SBC at all. All worked on buster
[00:49:33] <somiaj> first cat /etc/network/interfaces do you see any interface (other than lo) mentioned there?
[00:50:29] <mattb0ne> https://pastebin.com/qrhACxHH
[00:52:04] <somiaj> ugg pastebin, the worst possible paste bin, anyways your interface is listed there, so network-manager will ignore it. Sounds like you want to use network-manager, so delete lines 11-15 then reboot
[00:52:28] <mattb0ne> ok
[00:52:34] <mattb0ne> whats a better pastbin
[00:52:39] <mattb0ne> lol
[00:52:52] <somiaj> !termbin
[00:52:52] <dpkg> you can paste to termbin.com from terminal with redirections: try 'nc termbin.com 9999 < /path/to/file', or 'command | nc termbin.com 9999'
[00:52:57] <somiaj> I like that one, but paste.debian.net
[00:53:09] <somiaj> really any one that dosen't use javascript and throw ads at users
[00:53:54] <kveroneau> How does a paste site finance itself without the use of ads?
[00:55:09] <somiaj> paste.debian.net and terbin.com seem to do just fine, plenty of others too
[00:55:21] <somiaj> though paste.debian.net is quite slow, so there is that
[00:55:34] <somiaj> but termbin is great, use it with netcat, don't even need a browser
[00:55:54] <mattb0ne> ok
[00:57:07] <tesseract> you can set time how long you save the paste in debian paste
[00:57:19] <tesseract> that's great
[00:57:36] <somiaj> and create hidden pastes, it even has syntax higlighting (though that is more and more standard)

[01:04:05] <mattb0ne> so what did I actually do
[01:04:22] <mattb0ne> I now see icon changing in the background which is good
[01:04:33] <somiaj> mattb0ne: there are multiple ways to configure the network. The more server side is the interfaces file (Which installer sets up during the install)

[01:05:22] <somiaj> buster did the same thing, but it really depends on if you set up the network during the install or not
[01:05:24] <mattb0ne> ok
[01:05:32] <somiaj> so this isn't a buster vs bullseye different, they both act the exact same way in this regard

[01:09:31] <kveroneau> mattb0ne, I don't personally use NetworkManager as I use VMs, and I found it much more reliable not to use NetworkManager when using VMs and/or Docker.  For most use-cases, NetworkManager is preferred.
[01:09:50] <somiaj> mattb0ne: it is mostly user preference
[01:09:55] <mattb0ne> ok thanks for that tidbit
[01:10:03] <somiaj> mattb0ne: you seem to prefer its gui which is integrated into your DE, so you should just use it
[01:10:08] <mattb0ne> as a noob seems like network manager does more stuff for me
[01:10:14] <kveroneau> For example, when setting up Xen recently, I had to expell my system of NetworkManager to properly create the xenbr0 bridge interface, as NetworkManager was really interfering with it.
[01:10:16] <somiaj> I personally don't like network manager, but also don't use a DE, and find it easier to use the interfaces file
[01:10:19] <mattb0ne> eventually I want to learn a bit more networking

[08:04:45] <Guest29> Hey, I'm here with a VPN, I live in a repressive regime and I would like to know if Debian is 100% open-source (or even "free") so that I can be absolutely sure I cannot be tracked back?
[08:06:06] *** Joins: zitter (~danilodim@93-57-35-194.ip162.fastwebnet.it)
[08:10:03] <n4dir> The first answer is yes, the second is probably not
[08:11:10] <n4dir> there are projects which focus on such problems though. freedombox is one of them
[08:12:07] <Guest29> n4dir thanks for replying, why probably? I just want to be sure, there is no way the OS can be used to trace me back. I don't do anything morally bad, I just want to be sure I won't have to face any repercussions
[08:13:12] <n4dir> I can't really tell you exactly why. 10 years ago i investigated a lot freedombox and darknets and security in general. All which is left of that is that it is anything but easy
[08:14:08] <n4dir> you said 100 %. You sure can do some things. Doing it wrong might make things worse though
[08:14:33] <n4dir> as you see, this is not solid info, only my opinion.
[08:15:31] <Guest29> well I mean like 99,9%. I thought if it's open source I could be sure that no one hides any code on it which might allow governments to track its people
[08:15:49] <n4dir> That said: To me the application Retroshare looked at least not too hard to use. How secure it is i couldn't say. But it sure is more easy to use than, say, i2p

[08:17:39] <n4dir> Regarding your 99%. I'd say debian does the best it can. Else start for example with wiki.debian.org and freedombox project. Eben Moglen is involved, he has good speeches on youtube.
[08:18:22] <n4dir> if i am not wrong here, not repressive regime, the government makes the ISP's store the data for a given time. Nothing your OS could do about it. Again: very vague opinion
[08:18:23] <Guest29> I will look into it. I really thought with an open source system I could be sure that it's always checked and no one can include malicious code or anything, but I will keep searching then
[08:18:47] <n4dir> No malicious code will not prevent others from tracking you. I think
[08:19:07] <Guest29> n4dirI I know about the risks of using the internet, but I want to exclude this from what I want to know. I'm just talking purely about the operating system
[08:19:43] <n4dir> Ok, i think i got you. For an average user like me, i say there is no need to worry about that part of the whole problem.
[08:20:09] <n4dir> the operating system part. i mean
[08:20:57] <n4dir> Still a good idea to run as little as possible. Anything is a possible attack factor, so no need to run "services" you don't use  or need anyway

[14:55:59] <cef> So I have a debian bullseye setup connected to a TV using HDMI. When I switch the input away from the debian box to a different input for a while, then come back, the screensaver (which is disabled in settings) has kicked in and the TV says the HDMI input has no signal. How can I stop that behaviour? Machine has intel video, tho not sure that makes much difference here. Have tried turning DPMS off and on, no difference.
[14:57:20] <Haohmaru> cef is this TV the only display/monitor attached to the computer?
[14:57:50] <cef> Haohmaru: yes. no other screens.
[14:58:13] <Haohmaru> are you sure it's a screensaver and not "sleep"
[14:58:29] <Haohmaru> check your settings for powersaving
[14:59:09] *** Parts: rk4 (~r@user/rk4) ()
[15:01:16] <cef> Will do. Pretty sure it's off. One of those things now I have to "wait" to see if it happens again.
[15:02:42] <cef> Ok so it was on, but it was set to 1 hour, and this happens like after 10 minutes. Now disabled. Will see how I go.
[15:03:03] <cef> Much appreciated!
[15:04:59] <Haohmaru> or you might have multiple power managers/screensavers
[15:06:35] <cef> Yeah. This machine was installed with buster then immediately upgraded to bullseye. Wouldn't be surprised if something is stuck there somewhere. If it comes back I'll see if I can chase down those paths.

[18:28:16] <jelly> that's normal.
[18:28:21] <zitter> ?
[18:28:42] <jelly> it's normal that you can't access a random subdir from a share, just the whole share.
[18:29:39] <jelly> that's how cifs/samba shares work.  They're network filesystems, you "mount" (or use a client) the whole filesystem just just a tiny part of it.
[18:29:44] <pingpongball> jelly  here is my screenshot https://pasteboard.co/BrK5qZA7q5Md.png
[18:29:45] <zitter> OK, but *I* have create sub_dir_1 (win explorer)

[18:31:25] <pingpongball> is there any command i can put on grub
[18:31:32] <jelly> pingpongball: you'll have to boot a livecd of some linux, mount your debian / filesystem, chroot and set a root password to continue further
[18:31:37] <jelly> !ifrp
[18:31:37] <dpkg> For GRUB: 1) press 'e' to edit the kernel setting in the grub command line (add 'init=/bin/sh' to the end of it) 2) 'fsck' your root file system, 3) 'mount -o remount,rw /', 4) 'passwd root' 5) 'mount -o remount,ro /' 6) 'reboot -d -f' (exec /sbin/init should work); For LILO: 1) 'Linux init=/bin/sh' at the LILO boot prompt (hold Shift while booting), steps 2-6 are the same; For yaboot: 1) 'Linux init=/bin/sh' at yaboot prompt.

[21:01:31] <randall> calm-steam: Disregard what the other's said. The OFTC one is the official user support channel, which is also the largest one. This is an inofficial one, although some of the opers from OFTC also moderate the channel here.
[21:02:09] <randall> jmd: #debian-devel on OFTC would be for the devs. #debian on oftc is still a user support channel.
[21:07:47] <dob1> I can still send/receive emails even if the user is not in mail group (local mails)
