[00:42:17] <zar> j416 thanks, yeah this is mostly a theoretical problem right now. It's not meant for open source, I will have some control over every users environment, but trying to design something as flexible as possible. I'm coming from a background with exclusively perforce, so I want to leverage the easy branching of git. I could definitely store it outside
[00:42:18] <zar> of git if all else fails. Currently trying out a self-hosted gitea solution to manage the repos, but I'm trying to keep as much as possible in git itself as I'm not sure about that choice. But I'm starting to think that having to add the branch entry somewhere else if you want to have a custom branch distributed might just be the simplest solution
[00:42:18] <zar> for now.

[02:02:09] <j416> if you want to do it without the GUI, you can probably achieve it using their API
[02:02:20] <j416> or using their tool for it, they have a cli tool I think
[02:02:39] <j416> newpy: right. github will show you how.

[05:47:28] <humanBird> can someone clear this up with them. they seem pretty adamant that it's git's fault

[13:48:26] <cousteau> Hi
[13:48:41] *** dob1_ is now known as dob1
[13:49:58] <cousteau> If I create two commits with the exact same content, parent commit, commit message, author, author date, and commit date, they would have the same hash and be treated effectively as the same, right?

[13:51:56] <cousteau> I was wondering if there was a way to replicate a commit exsctly on another repository without directly connecting to the original one and pulling/fetching the commit.  But I guess the tricky part would be to replicate the commit date, which cannot be modified/faked.

[13:52:53] <j416> cousteau: yes, you can do this.
[13:53:01] <j416> cousteau: they would be identical and have the same hash.
[13:54:12] <j416> cousteau: you can set the commit info using env vars. man git-commit look for GIT_
[13:54:12] <gitinfo> cousteau: the git-commit manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-commit.html
[13:54:30] <j416> you can also create the commit object manually.
[13:54:51] <j416> or, create a commit and then modify it.

I assumed security/sanity reasons (being able to mess with commits like this seems risky, plus I vaguely recall that git uses commit date order for something).  Although I guess if git didn't allow this directly it could still theoretically be faked by changing the system time.

[19:25:18] <ralf> Hi! Hope someone can help. Following situation: In one repo we switched to Git from SVN two years ago without migrating the history. So, the first commit in the Git repo is the last revision in SVN. Now, we want to incoroporate the old history (as migrated by the nirvdrum/svn2git) . Which order of commands would you recommend? I tried it before with 1. Add the new repo as a remote to the old one (the newly migrated one) 2.
[19:25:19] <ralf> Rebase master branch (other branches are irrelevant) of new repo onto last commit of old repo -> The result is a ton of merge conflicts that do not seem necessary

(note, oddly when I do a `git diff` (or `git diff --cached`) between bar.bash and

[20:45:14] <nkm77> yes
[20:45:41] <OnlineCop> Okay; if you run just `ssh-agent` does it show any output, or show that the file can't be found?
[20:46:29] <OnlineCop> For me, `ssh-agent` shows `SSH_AUTH_SOCK=...; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=...; export SSH_AGENT_PID;`
[20:47:01] <nkm77> it gives this message   unable to start ssh-agent service, error :1058

[20:49:24] <OnlineCop> nkm77: Is your OS Linux, Mac, or Windows?
[20:49:31] <nkm77> windows
[20:50:29] <OnlineCop> PowerShell: `cd Program Files\OpenSSH-Win64` then within that, `.\install-sshd.ps1` and then ssh-agent started to work.
[20:50:49] <OnlineCop> Of course, you need OpenSSH installed (change directory to whatever makes sense on your system).

[20:54:05] <nkm77> should  i make a new directory with name OpenSSH-Win64 and then run that command?
[20:54:08] <OnlineCop> If you install via Chocolatey, `choco install openssh` should install it to C:\Program Files\OpenSSH-Win64. You can choose a different location if you'd like.
[20:54:49] <OnlineCop> And then within that directory, running the `.\install-sshd.ps1` is what fixed it for other people.
[20:55:23] <OnlineCop> `ssh-agent` should then be added to your environment PATH, so you should be able to access it anywhere.
[20:56:59] <nkm77> okay. i created a directory in program files with name "OpenSSH-Win64" and then using powershell went to this directory and run this comand "choco install openssh"

[21:00:04] <meder> ^ and git pull would only grab changes for my feature branch so I don't think that's what I'd need

[22:07:15] <nkm77> but then to change which code? the copy one or the original?
[22:07:45] <nkm77> if i need to change any code..
[22:07:54] <imMute> ideally the git repo copy, since you'll want git to track your changes too
[22:08:47] <nkm77> okay.
[22:09:20] <nkm77> all of you guys do the same? means keep two copies of code. one original and one in git directory
[22:09:33] <imMute> no, most people work directly out of the git repo
[22:09:45] <imMute> but since you're new to git, it's safer to keep a backup copy while you're still learning
[22:09:46] <nkm77> how to do that?
[22:10:13] <nkm77> for now i just want to push my this code to my repo.
[22:10:30] <imMute> just edit the files in that youtubeclone directory (that's the git repo)

[22:11:43] <nkm77> okay. let me copy everything to this new directory
[22:12:20] <nkm77> if i copied everything. then just type git push -u origin master command?
[22:12:54] <nkm77> for testing i copy some files to this newly directory to check if it works or not
[22:13:05] <imMute> no, you need to do other things.  seriously, you need to read how to use git.

[22:22:32] <_lungaro_> is there a way with git, given a path, find where the .git dir is by searching up the tree?
[22:23:36] <ikke> git -C <path> rev-parse --show-toplevel
[22:23:44] <ikke> <path> needs to be a directory
[22:24:01] <_lungaro_> sweet
[22:24:20] <ikke> That would show the top-level, so you would need to append /.git to get the .git directory
[22:24:35] <imMute> and for older gits there's a trick with an "! pwd" alias
[22:24:52] <ikke> right, aliases are run in the toplevel
