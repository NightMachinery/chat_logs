[17:35:25] <Joanna> It’s all probably a preplanned distraction. One thing you can be sure of is they already have a fall guy set up ahead of time. I’ve heard stories about head on train collisions which have been blamed on dead driver texting when it could also have been caused by faulty signals and nobody ever discusses why trains traveling in opposite directions were not on separate tracks...
[17:36:14] <Joanna> Wikipedia has definitely become a disappointment.
[17:37:03] <jan6> heh
[17:37:19] <jan6> I don't think it's "ahead of time" usually

[17:47:11] <Joanna> It seemed that crowds were unruly earlier in the day. 50k people in an enclosed area is not safe for many different reasons. I don’t think the guy performing on stage is responsible. It’s so chaotic it’s hard to notice what is happening unless you are near the crushing.
[17:48:51] <jan6> well, he's a bit responsible
[17:49:36] <jan6> apparently people yelled at him to stop, because people were dying, and he just ignored them for a while, even when they climbed on the stage, and afterwards just resumed his show
[17:49:53] <Joanna> And what’s with using a hooded figure that looks like a grim reaper clutching a crystal ball as part of the show and a stage shaped like upside down crucifix?
[17:50:22] <jan6> ooooh he tooootally PLANNNED to sacrifice people! omaigaaaaawd
[17:50:32] <jan6> lol
[17:50:35] <Joanna> No idea
[17:50:46] <jan6> forgot airquotes
[17:51:09] <Joanna> I think performance artists have people who manage their shows don’t they?
[17:51:17] <jan6> usually, yes
[17:52:00] <Joanna> So that’s who is at fault his handlers. You can’t expect a performer to know all the dynamics of crowd control
[17:52:09] <jan6> which is what people are also commenting at some places in the thread, like comparing someone else, only to be met with "well, that person had dedicated crew to notice and take care of such people, unlike the guy here"
[17:52:20] <jan6> yeah
[17:53:12] <Joanna> They could have had the event in a stadium with reserved seats right ?
[17:53:35] <jan6> technically, I suppose so
[17:53:53] <Joanna> The show was spectacular even from a distance
[17:54:48] <jan6> I think people's main problem is that he's focused on giving a great show, not the people dying in the proccess
[17:55:57] <Joanna> That’s his job. People who set up the event should be prepared for a stampede or other problems.
[17:56:32] <Joanna> The event organizers should have insurance right ?
[17:56:37] <JimBuntu> I have been to sooooo many open floor concerts, a lot of pretty tough ones too with large slam dancing/mosh pits... it can get dangerous, really it's dangerous from the start to have that many people interacting, especially when it involves music.  I'm not saying they shouldn't be allowed to happen though, simple accepting how dangerous the situation is.
[17:56:47] <JimBuntu> gm Joanna and jan6 
[17:57:07] <Joanna> Hi JimBuntu
[17:59:25] <JimBuntu> re wikipedia... I try to filter out anything that doesn't have refereces. I often use it simply to find the references, lol.  Getting quality information can be time intensive that's what used to make journalism (not simply reporting) so difficult and worthy of praise.
[18:00:45] <Joanna> Deadly stampedes can even happen at religious gatherings where nobody is drunk https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11893346/Saudi-Hajj-stampede-special-forces-deployed-to-control-crowds.html
[18:00:46] <SeaDough> ^ Saudi Hajj stampede: special forces deployed to control crowds
[18:02:08] <JimBuntu> For sure Joanna. It's about the number of people per square unit.  If you don't have the option of avoiding touching, then it becomes a shoving match.
[18:03:06] <JimBuntu> Same kind of thing can be observed at parades... or events such as New Years... with people being slammed up against railings/fences.
[18:03:31] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[18:04:05] <JimBuntu> I mean, this is such a well known issue... it's even used as an example regarding limitations to free speech... as in, the old 'yelling fire in a movie theatre' concept
[18:05:40] <Joanna> I’ve noticed than when people are in big crowds it with the exception of military formations it becomes very difficult to move and I’ve had the urge to start shoving on several occasions myself.
[18:08:19] <Joanna> So frustrating if you want to leave a movie theater and people refuse to walk fast to get out. You really need to have employees to herd people all the way out so they don’t get stuck. At train stations when it’s over crowded that’s when people decide it’s a good idea to block the escalator and refuse to walk up it.
[18:09:07] <Joanna> I think there is an entire field of study based upon how crowds behave.
[18:09:55] <s1gyn> It really helps in concerts if the band discourages crazy behavior
[18:09:59] <JimBuntu> Those concerts I mentioned... were often at places where security/goons would be used to push everyone out quickly at the end or in the event of an issue.
[18:10:28] <JimBuntu> agreed s1gyn 
[18:12:43] <Joanna> The band doesn’t always have control like if there is  and unexpected fire and some smart person has decided to chain the exit doors closed because they are worried about people sneaking in. Unusable exits have caused many many deaths in all sorts of places.
[18:15:39] <s1gyn> Like I used to listen to Rush bootlegs all the time and there is one where they stop the show and Geddy Lee sounds VERY angry at the show. Contrast that to encouraging moshpits and stuff
[18:16:39] <Joanna> Rush is a different type of crowd than punk rockers :)
[18:19:46] <Joanna> The whole lack of diversity in music is mostly overlooked issue. Before the phonograph was invented there were a lot more musicians to entertain people instead of one artist entertaining 50k people
[18:20:01] <JimBuntu> I have been there when the band has stopped a pit from getting out of hand, but it's rare.
[18:20:39] <Joanna> What do they do in the pit ? Beat eachother up ?
[18:20:51] <s1gyn> Basically
[18:21:15] <JimBuntu> Yeah, pretty much, but not real fighting... more about banging into each other... a lot of elbows sometimes
[18:21:23] <Joanna> Maybe they like that and find it entertaining.
[18:21:30] <JimBuntu> I sure liked it, lol
[18:22:09] <Joanna> So there you have it. I’m going to assume only guys go into the mosh pit deliberately
[18:22:21] <JimBuntu> Few females, correct
[18:22:46] <Joanna> Don’t punks wear spiked clothing?
[18:22:56] <Joanna> Or Carry weapons?
[18:23:06] <JimBuntu> Sometimes, spikes, almost always carry weapons
[18:23:24] <Joanna> And they have chains also
[18:23:27] <JimBuntu> But the point of the pits isn't to pull a weapon on someone. It's mutual normally.
[18:23:52] <Joanna> So it’s a form of dancing ..
[18:24:01] <JimBuntu> It's a form of expression, like dancing is
[18:24:25] <JimBuntu> "I'm angry" or "I'm very excited" or "I'm so happy I could kick you, stranger"
[18:24:33] <Joanna> Lol
[18:24:55] <Joanna> Do you mosh with people you know?
[18:25:19] <JimBuntu> I would mosh with people I knew, but mostly people I didn't or people I would see each weekend at the same places.
[18:26:05] <Joanna> Did you ever form a friendship with someone you met moshing “
[18:26:06] <JimBuntu> Whoever goes to the concert... and decides to go into the pit... that's who you have to mosh with, because that is who is there.  Sometimes there would be mutliple pits, depends on the size
[18:26:20] <JimBuntu> heck yeah I did form friendships with some!
[18:26:59] <Joanna> So funny ...
[18:27:39] <JimBuntu> After a concert like this, where you get pushed out... everyone stands around outside, licks their wounds... then figures out where to go next... big lines of cars and we would often meet up at places for food or coffee or drinks.  Wasn't exactly planned, but when you see a group of cars leaving together you can follow them
[18:27:45] <Joanna> I didn’t imagine you were a punk rocker!
[18:28:12] <JimBuntu> I'm not really a punk any more, I am still a SHARP though
[18:28:25] <Joanna> What’s that ?
[18:28:32] <JimBuntu> Anti-racist skin head
[18:28:43] <Joanna> Oh
[18:29:36] <Joanna> I’m baffled as to why anyone would want to be bald..
[18:30:51] <JimBuntu> haha, well I'm not totally bald and the name is a bit off... you don't actually have to be bald, but it was quite common to be so.  It was part of the 'style' of dress.
[18:32:10] <Joanna> Monks also favor baldness for some reason
[18:33:44] <JimBuntu> I think for monks there were a lot of reasons, including maybe the glow... and no doubt it was cleaner.
[18:34:02] <Joanna> I’m curious what techniques they used to empty venues quickly “
[18:35:14] <JimBuntu> Well, the one I am most familiar with was to form a line of big guys by the stage area... they stand just far enough apart so that if they swing their arms there is a couple feet between them... then start yelling and swinging while slowly moving forward... then once they make contact it's a bunch of pushing to keep the crowd moving
[18:35:26] <Joanna> Come to think of it Buddha is often depicted as bald but not always
[18:36:15] <JimBuntu> It's not easy to convince a large crowd to stop  partying and leave, lol
[18:36:56] <Joanna> Did they open all sorts of exit doors ?
[18:37:39] <JimBuntu> Yeah, the would turn on all of the lights and open all the exit doors, at least the ones at the front or whereever they wanted people to go
[18:37:59] <JimBuntu> For outdoors venues, it was basically the same except less lighting
[18:38:06] <Joanna> Sounds like bars at closing time.
[18:38:58] <JimBuntu> I have only been at bars when they closed a few times.  At the coffee bar though, the owner was cool and would often invite some of us to stay around after lock-up
[18:40:18] <Joanna> I don’t like staying out late anymore. I’d rather get up at sunrise
[18:41:53] <Joanna> Early to bed early to rise makes you healthy happy and wise ..
