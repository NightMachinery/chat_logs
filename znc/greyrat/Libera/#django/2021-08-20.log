[04:45:53] <moldy> esaym153: i'm not sure if i could land a job at my current company nowadays :) back when i joined, i got a call by the CEO, went to their office, we talkes for 5 minutes, i fixed a trivial config problem and was basically hired
[04:46:20] <moldy> (in other words: sometimes you just need a bit of luck)
[04:46:41] <esaym153> moldy: yea, sadly every job I've ever had mostly has no interview process other than a few questions and then "When can you start"
[04:48:04] <moldy> i'm not a fan of HR / management filtering applicants based on their CVs, but OTOH somebody has to do some kind of filtering i guess
[04:48:28] <FunkyBob> it's automated filtering I find most egregious

[05:03:52] <FunkyBob> please... answer my questions

[05:03:58] <wallbroken> i'm just asking
[05:04:08] <FunkyBob> you don't think there's a problem... but you're asking for help to solve the problem anyway?
[05:04:14] <FunkyBob> 23:22 < wallbroken> FunkyBob: i'm still in problems with signals.py
[05:04:20] <FunkyBob> except... you opened by saying  there were problems
[05:04:36] <wallbroken> the problem is that i'm building it up
[05:04:38] <wallbroken> for example
[05:04:51] <wallbroken> do i need to say somewhere to execute what is in signals.py?
[05:04:57] <FunkyBob> yes
[05:05:25] <FunkyBob> until that file is imported, the signal handler is not registered.
[05:05:34] <FunkyBob> but you need to register it _after_ the models have been loaded
[05:05:45] <FunkyBob> the safest place to do this is in the 'ready' hook in your AppConfig
[05:06:08] <FunkyBob> and here I was expecting you to say "Well, I tried it and it didn't create the record"...
[05:08:07] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.ready
[05:10:18] <wallbroken> "receiver" is not defined
[05:10:36] <FunkyBob> ok?
[05:10:53] <FunkyBob> since that's not mentioned at all in the code you've shown us...
[05:10:59] <FunkyBob> i have no idea what that is in reference to
[05:11:08] <wallbroken> it's in the link you geave me
[05:11:24] <wallbroken>       # registering signals with the model's string label
[05:11:35] <FunkyBob> yeah, you weren't supposed to cut'n'paste their example
[05:11:42] <FunkyBob> you were supposed to use your brain
[05:11:52] <FunkyBob> all your ready method needs to do is import the signals module
[05:12:01] *** Joins: Guddu (~Guddu@190.84.88.92)
[05:12:31] <FunkyBob> the link was to explain what the ready method was, where to find it, how it's called.
[05:12:54] <wallbroken> so, what do i need to do?
[05:17:41] <FunkyBob> what I said
[05:17:59] <FunkyBob> import the signals module in your ready method
[05:18:16] <FunkyBob> since the signal registration is executed top level in that module, importing it is enough
[05:18:39] <FunkyBob> but you can't import it until django's done its startup stuff, hence being in the ready hook

[06:20:26] <wallbroken> well, for me this signals.py is something completely new
[06:20:34] <wallbroken> so i come in understanding logic
[06:21:39] <FunkyBob> I linked you to the Signals docs so you could get an introduction to what they were, and how to use them.
[06:21:48] <FunkyBob> and... you came up with a valid looking signal receiver function
[06:21:51] <FunkyBob> so that seemed to work
[06:22:12] <wallbroken> yes, but there is the other side to implement
[06:22:13] <wallbroken> appconfig
[06:22:19] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:22:24] <wallbroken> and there i have no clue on how to do that
[06:22:27] <FunkyBob> sure
[06:22:42] <FunkyBob> so I told you waht you needed to do, and a link to the relevant docs..
[06:23:01] <FunkyBob> what I told you you needed to do was "import your signals module"
[06:23:54] <FunkyBob> and even explained why it needed to be in the ready hook
[06:24:05] <wallbroken> i alread did that
[06:24:06] <wallbroken> from shoes.signals import AccountConfig
[06:24:22] <FunkyBob> inside the ready method?
[06:24:33] <wallbroken> outside
[06:24:34] <FunkyBob> I don't know what you did because you never showed us
[06:24:50] <FunkyBob> yeah, that's not going to work... for the reasons I stated
[06:24:56] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/USNR
[06:25:02] <wallbroken> i added it also inside
[06:25:04] <FunkyBob> 1. your signals will tryo to access models as soon as it's imported
[06:25:13] <FunkyBob> 2. django won't be ready, so it will fail
[06:25:30] <FunkyBob> instead, import it only inside your ready method, so it's guaranteed to happen _after_ django is ready
[06:25:40] <wallbroken> ok
[06:25:48] <FunkyBob> no, see, you have all that other stuff in  your ready method
[06:25:50] <FunkyBob> ONLY the import
[06:26:18] <FunkyBob> you cut and pasted code again that YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS DOING
[06:26:29] <FunkyBob> how many times do we have to tell you to NEVER DO THAT?
[06:26:44] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/yRfM
[06:27:03] <FunkyBob> that's even worse
[06:27:10] <wallbroken> why?
[06:27:14] <FunkyBob> all your indenting is munted... and ... no
[06:27:18] <FunkyBob> that's not what I said to do
[06:27:27] <FunkyBob> take the EXISTING app config class
[06:27:30] <FunkyBob> add a ready method to it
[06:27:30] <wallbroken> you told me to put only import inside the ready()
[06:27:33] <FunkyBob>  and in the ready method
[06:27:39] <FunkyBob> import your signals module
[06:27:48] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes,... but you kept all the other bullshit
[06:28:20] <FunkyBob> the file you pasted is shoes/app.py yes?
[06:28:21] <wallbroken> 03:57:27 AM - FunkyBob: take the EXISTING app config class
[06:28:26] <wallbroken> which one are you referring to?
[06:28:47] <FunkyBob> which one was there before you messed with the file?
[06:29:14] <FunkyBob> also... NOWHERE in that code do you import your signals module...
[06:29:18] <FunkyBob> so you haven't done what I said
[06:29:48] <FunkyBob> from the default app.py that django gave you, you needed to add only two lines of code
[06:30:12] <FunkyBob> instead you've copy'n'pasted  stuff from examples... without understanding any of it
[06:30:17] <FunkyBob> and not done the one thing you needed to do
[06:31:07] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/sFK5
[06:31:10] <FunkyBob> ... is that paste showing the content of _two_ files?  is that why ther's two AppConfig classes?
[06:32:04] <FunkyBob> why are you importing pre_save? why id that a ready function, not a method?  why are you importing the model, not the signals module?
[06:32:19] <FunkyBob> s/id/is/
[06:32:32] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/amYw
[06:32:36] <wallbroken> this is the original file
[06:32:49] <FunkyBob> right
[06:32:56] <FunkyBob> from there you need add ONLY 2 lines
[06:33:06] <wallbroken> ok, as we said
[06:33:11] <FunkyBob> one declaring your custom ready method... and its body being to import your signals module
[06:33:14] <wallbroken> the first one is to import signal class
[06:33:15] <wallbroken> rght?
[06:33:17] <FunkyBob> no
[06:33:41] <FunkyBob> the import MUST be inside the ready method, so it only happens when django is ready
[06:34:42] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/yH4s
[06:34:59] <wallbroken> wait
[06:35:02] <wallbroken> you call it "method"
[06:35:05] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:35:09] <wallbroken> method is supposed to be inside a class
[06:35:11] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:35:13] <wallbroken> that is not a method
[06:35:14] <wallbroken> it's a function
[06:35:15] <FunkyBob> no
[06:35:17] <FunkyBob> correct
[06:35:24] <wallbroken> it must be a method or a function?
[06:35:27] <FunkyBob> method
[06:35:35] <wallbroken> then i need to place it inside the class
[06:35:37] <CapnKernel> Don't know if this helps, wallbroken, but imports are just statements.  They don't have to be just at the top of a file.  They can be at any point in your code, and be executed during your program run (not just when the program starts)

[08:16:21] <CapnKernel> Guest67: Is this in a view?
[08:16:26] <Guest67> yes
[08:16:33] <Guest67> https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/tutorials/browser-calls-python-django
[08:16:53] <Guest67> https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-django/blob/main/browser_calls/views.py#L60
[08:17:04] <CapnKernel> A view is called when a request comes from the web browser back to the server.  The view handles the information sent from the browser to the server.
[08:17:05] <FunkyBob> Guest67: request.POST is the parsed post data from the request
[08:17:11] <CapnKernel> Yep that
[08:17:44] <CapnKernel> That information can be sent as a GET request or a POST request.  If it was a POST request (usual for a form), request.POST is a dict containing the information sent from the browser.
[08:17:46] <Guest67> so it is not POSTing to the server to make a call to that phoneNumber when i click the call button?
[08:17:54] <FunkyBob> no
[08:18:04] <Guest67> it just gets the phoneNumber from the form input?
[08:18:06] <CapnKernel> So no, request.POST does not "send a POST to the browser"
[08:18:08] <FunkyBob> it's getting the value of the 'phoneNumber' field that was posted to this server
[08:18:12] <FunkyBob> that  this view is processing
[08:18:35] <FunkyBob> are you confusing the request object wit hthe requests library?
[08:18:45] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects
[08:18:48] <CapnKernel> dial.number() may do calling
[08:18:53] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.POST
[08:18:59] <Guest67> so if i just do dial.number('+12345678909') it is the same thing?
[08:19:40] <Guest67> it isn't calling though idk what i am doing wrong in the tutorial :/
[08:19:40] <FunkyBob> Guest67: request.POST['phoneNumber'] is getting the 'phoneNumber' field value from the posted form
[08:19:47] <FunkyBob> dial.number() is... your other libs API
[08:19:51] <CapnKernel> If dial.number('+12345678909') calls a number for you, and requests.POST['phoneNumber'] contains '+12345678909', then dial.number('+12345678909') and dial.number(request.POST['phoneNumber']) will do the same thing
[08:19:52] <Guest67> right

[08:20:18] <Guest67> so here i will show you my code compared to those 2 links
[08:20:37] <Guest67> for some reason i get an XML page but it isn't dialing the phone numbers

[08:35:33] <Guest67> or TwiML

[08:36:53] <Guest67> the docs seem to be outdated with the github
[08:37:32] <Guest67> I found https://anvil.works/articles/twilio-browser-call
[08:37:51] <Guest67> which is what I want to do but it uses Anvil and import Twilio does not work
[08:38:36] <Guest67> i also setup a webhook as well and am using ngrok

[08:40:53] <Guest67> i don't need all the support dashboard stuff in the tutorial i just want to setup what the anvil link shows but with a form instead. I am not tying into the form for now instead I am just forcing the numbers into the django when the call button is clicked
[08:41:13] <Guest67> in the twilio docs client token is now called access token
[08:41:48] <Guest67> the whole feature i want out of this is to literally make a call through the browser and use my mic to talk to people

[08:56:48] <CapnKernel> Guest67: The server where you run Django might be in one room, but your browser might be in one room (or on another continent).  If dial.number() runs on the server, what do you want to happen?
[08:57:08] <CapnKernel> Coz it seems like you need to do the dialing where the client is (ie, javascript land), not where the server is.
[08:57:44] <Guest67> hmm that could be
[08:57:51] <CapnKernel> Can you say with 100% certainty "the browser and server are the same machine"?
[08:58:04] <Guest67> right now i am on localhost testing with a bunch of burner phones
[08:58:17] <Guest67> and the free trial twilio number
[08:58:31] <CapnKernel> Can you say with 100% certainty "the browser and server are the same machine"?
[08:58:43] <Guest67> yes
[08:58:46] <CapnKernel> Ok good.
[08:59:15] <CapnKernel> Then what you're after is feasible, _however_ "literally make a call through the browser" is impossible
[08:59:33] <CapnKernel> It will be the server, via Django and twilio, that makes the call, not the browser
[08:59:51] <CapnKernel> The browser just acts as a trigger for making the call.  The call is done on the server.
[09:00:53] <CapnKernel> Something like this: 1. Client requests web page.  2. Server prepares web form, sends it back to the client.  3. User fills out phone number, hits "call".  4. Server receives the form data, and makes the call.
[09:00:53] <Guest67> ah yes you are right
[09:02:08] <CapnKernel> Does that line up with what you want?
[09:02:53] <Guest67> yes
[09:03:34] <CapnKernel> Ok, then your template doesn't need {{token}}.  The token never gets sent to the browser.  The token is just needed server-side to make the call.
[09:05:13] <CapnKernel> I'm still not sure where the TwiML comes in.
[09:05:29] <CapnKernel> And you say "for some reason i get an XML page but it isn't dialing the phone numbers".  Please tell me more about that.
[09:05:57] <CapnKernel> Is TwiML something your code produces, and passes to the Twilio lib?  Or is it something that comes from the Twilio lib?
[09:06:16] <Guest67> so i don't need any of that javascript code?
[09:07:09] <Guest67> my understanding is twiml is like an XML equivalent of the django code
[09:07:23] <Guest67> but it is supposedly easier for people to make
[09:07:38] <CapnKernel> currently looking at https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/voice-javascript-sdk-quickstart-python
[09:08:06] <Guest67> i am not a fan of the twiml i'd rather have the python code to call instead but the tutorial uses it
[09:08:12] <CapnKernel> What I'm trying to work out is how much of their example is twilio doing in the browser, and how much is in server code.

[09:09:40] <Guest67> yes the twiml is produced by the code via  response = VoiceResponse()
[09:10:19] <Guest67> but maybe you have to use that for what they call through the browser but is actually the server from what you said
[09:11:48] <CapnKernel> This code?  https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/voice-javascript-sdk-quickstart-python/blob/main/app.py
[09:12:30] <Guest67> it is similar but written in flask
[09:12:46] <CapnKernel> That page is call the Javascript SDK.  My guess is it's a full JS lib running in the browser that operates the twilio lib on the server.

[09:13:53] <CapnKernel> Yeah they look roughly equivalent
[09:17:00] <CapnKernel> My guess is that the result of the dial.number() call on line 60 gets secretly tucked away inside twilio, then str(response) on line 67 magically retrieves it.  That's where the "Twilio Ready" message you're hoping would come from.

[09:24:51] <Guest67> yes sorry the browser
[09:25:19] <foo> I was helping Guest67 in #twilio, moving here.
[09:25:23] <CapnKernel> When asking for help, it helps us if you can be really specific about stuff.  "it" or "I" is really unhelpful
[09:25:27] <CapnKernel> foo: Welcome
[09:25:55] <foo> Where I left it is, I'd like to ask Guest67 where they think the TwiML gets sent to Twilio. We already verified the TwiML that's being generated is accurate
[09:26:14] <CapnKernel> foo: Have you seen this?  https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-django/blob/main/browser_calls/views.py
[09:26:23] <Guest67> sorry capnkernel
[09:26:42] <foo> CapnKernel: I'm semi-busy and was trying to see if I could help Guest67 resolve it on their own simply by asking questions.
[09:26:50] <CapnKernel> Yeah
[09:27:50] <foo> It sounds to me like his app is not sending the TwiML to the Twilio system to be executed.
[09:28:07] <foo> Guest67, I imagine you can follow the code to see where the TwiML should be getting sent to Twilio.
[09:28:42] <CapnKernel> My guess is that line 54 seems to generate some kind of object.  In line 60, some magic happens behind the scenes, and there's some internal logging or state or something.  The evaluation of response on line 67 scrapes that saved stuff, and it gets returned to the browser
[09:29:01] <Guest67> hmmm maybe it is because i am on an XML page but my javascript is not?
[09:29:17] <Guest67> i need the xml and javascript to be on the same page?
[09:29:28] <Guest67> or output of the xml to be on the same page as the javascript

[09:29:54] <foo> CapnKernel: Yup, Guest67 manually processed that in Twilio's console so we know that works.
[09:30:00] <CapnKernel> foo: Are you saying that needs to be sent to Twilio, that it's reception of that by Twilio that actually does the call?
[09:30:31] <foo> Guest67: You're trying to make an outbound call, not process an inbound call, right?
[09:30:45] <Guest67> yes outbound for right now
[09:30:56] <Guest67> accepting inbound would be a future thing
[09:31:04] <CapnKernel> foo: At present, his code is returning the XML to the browser.  Is that what you'd expect?
[09:31:24] <foo> CapnKernel: My hunch is that XML (per that dpaste) needs to get sent to the Twilio server.
[09:31:46] <CapnKernel> To me, I'd either expect the twilio lib on the server to send that to Twilio, or if it's returned to the browser, the browser would then need to forward that on
[09:31:53] <Guest67> webhook?
[09:32:05] <CapnKernel> And somewhere in there, something needs to control the attached mobile phone
[09:32:27] <foo> CapnKernel: I think you're correct.
[09:32:38] <foo> Guest67: A webhook would not be used for an outbound call, that would be used to process an inbound call.
[09:32:46] <Guest67> ooh
[09:33:07] <foo> Guest67: I suggest reading up on webhooks, might just take you a few minutes to get the concept

[09:34:17] <CapnKernel> Guest67: See this code?  Between line 59 and 60 you could put print('phoneNumber=', request.POST['phoneNumber'])
[09:34:20] <foo> Guest67: Think about it: outbound is when you talk to Twilio and it initiates something. Inbound would mean Twilio is talking to your system, via a webhook. Maybe that flow helps.
[09:34:38] <CapnKernel> Let's park inbound for today, and think about getting outbound working :-)
[09:34:50] <foo> CapnKernel: Fair enough. ;)
[09:35:06] <CapnKernel> Obviously you have to work out how to integrate the print() into your own code
[09:35:22] <CapnKernel> But I'd be interested to know what you see at the django console.
[09:35:50] <CapnKernel> Should be something like: phoneNumber= +19876543212

[09:35:57] <Guest67> well the problem is I don't have phoneNumber anywhere in my forms.py or template which is why I hard code the number into dial()

[09:51:05] <CapnKernel> Guest67: If you're hardcoding the number, then request.POST['phoneNumber'] is a bit further down the track.  Getting the hard coded number working is the first step
[09:51:25] <Guest67> right
[09:51:33] <Guest67> https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml
[09:51:37] <Guest67> for your reference
[09:54:18] <foo> Guest67: can you link me to the code again and let me know where you think your code/the library should be sending the TwiML to Twilio?
[09:54:46] <Guest67> https://dpaste.org/v0cC
[09:55:36] <Guest67> line 68 - 74 in the javascript
[09:55:43] <foo> Guest67: Are you thinking 146 conditional does everything?
[09:56:02] <Guest67> i did at first but i think the js lines have something to do with it
[09:56:12] <Guest67> because stripe works like that
[09:56:15] <Guest67> very similar
[09:56:50] <Guest67> stripe has stripe.js which is javascript that takes the credit card input from the form and sends it to stripe
[09:57:49] <Guest67> let me try a few things bc i don't have phoneNumber in my forms or template
[09:57:49] <foo> Guest67: I'm not sure I'd draw any correlations to stripe here, we're not talking about stripe.
[09:58:00] <foo> Guest67: I would simplify this until you can get it working
[09:58:03] <Guest67> yes but i imagine it is similar to how stripe does it with their api
[09:58:05] <foo> Guest67: Can you get into a regular python shell and initiate a call?
[09:58:20] <Guest67> i could but what should i call?
[09:59:35] <Guest67> console.log(device); shows undefined for the device

[11:10:24] <gcain> OK, cool. And then I'd just use search using this... I'm guessing it's a lot better to have a SearchVectorField and a GIN index on it too?
[11:11:10] <FunkyBob> if you can pre-calculate the to_tsquery into an index, yeah, that should make it faster
[11:11:36] <FunkyBob> again, django iis just using the DBMS... how best to do it in PG is how best to do it

[14:09:42] <bandit_za> CapnKernel that is a poor suggestion
[14:09:51] <CapnKernel> How much did you pay for it?
[14:09:59] <bandit_za> it is a suggestion which applies to every single problem and is completely impractical
[14:10:16] <CapnKernel> Exactly.  It's a generalised technique
[14:10:29] <bandit_za> i'm not completely materialistic to believe that the worth of all things is what you pay for them
[14:10:33] <CapnKernel> We're not going to hand you your solution on a plate
[14:10:40] <bandit_za> but, seriously, what is the point of posting a solution like that?
[14:11:05] <CapnKernel> It's not a solution.  It's a technique you can use to HELP YOURSELF, if no-one here offers anything better.
[14:11:28] <bandit_za> there's this newer technique called version control
[14:11:32] <CapnKernel> If someone does actually offer you some focused help, you won't need my suggestion.  More power to you!
[14:11:47] <CapnKernel> It's not dissimilar to things like git bisect, yes.
[14:11:51] <bandit_za> it's an excellent solution to the class of problems your solution solves. unfotunlately, that's not my issue
[14:12:07] <bandit_za> *unfortunately
[14:12:07] <CapnKernel> Not going to fight you, got better things to do.  Enjoy.
[14:13:15] <CapnKernel> If you're able to say "it works when I do A, but with this small change to B", then we may be able to help you
[14:13:31] <CapnKernel> *but with this small change to B it stops working"

[14:27:42] <GinFuyou> well, here I notice suspicious import  `from mtgl.live.models import Match` - what is mtgl.live ?
[14:27:51] <bandit_za> the problem is that I am an idiot and the solution was to read the error message, not copy out the whole model into a NEW project. is that the kind of pain people would be willing to subject themselves to? anyways the solution in this case was to explicitly define `app_label` on `Meta`
[14:28:05] <bandit_za> thanks for the help, GinFuyou
[14:28:30] <bandit_za> GinFuyou I am using django-cookiecutter and the way it lays out apps is slightly different to the django standard.
[14:28:37] <GinFuyou> No really, you usually don't define app label explicitly
[14:29:01] <gcain> bandit_za: Isolation testing is the first tool we're all taught in engineering... The suggestion was 100% valid.
[14:29:13] <GinFuyou> Well, yeah, this one could be the case

[14:52:07] <serafeim> hey FunkyBob in your code here: https://blog.tinbrain.net/blog/session-auth-spa.html i can't udnerstand where you get the value from the csrf_token you pass in your login ajax code
[14:59:28] <knbk> serafeim: that's described here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/csrf/#ajax (it's linked in the "Problems" section)
[15:01:15] <serafeim> knbk: this doesn't help me that much
[15:02:17] <knbk> anything specific that's unclear?
[15:02:50] <serafeim> yes you have to read the blog post i posted before to understand
[15:03:20] <serafeim> in it you'll see that it has some ajax code for loggin in. where it passes a csrf_token
[15:03:37] <serafeim> however there's no place where that csrf_token can be retrieved
[15:03:40] *** Quits: audiobirb (~audio@2603-8081-1801-3bb5-27c8-a94a-768a-c5a3.res6.spectrum.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[15:03:45] <serafeim> i know how to retrieve it if i have a normal django page.
[15:04:51] <knbk> the first part describes how to ensure the csrf cookie is set. The django docs then describe how you can retrieve the cookie value in JS. All you have to do is replace the literal `csrf_token` in the ajax call with the value retrieved from the cookie
[15:06:11] <serafeim> knbk: but i don't have that cookie anywhere. i haven't login normally
[15:06:46] <serafeim> my only transaction with the server is getting and posting that view
[15:06:56] <knbk> that's explained in the blog post.... in "The Endpoint"
[15:07:42] <serafeim> i've read it
[15:07:57] <serafeim> it doesn't say anything on where to retriegve the csrf_token
[15:08:23] <knbk> you do a GET request to an endpoint that has `@ensure_csrf_cookie` to ensure the cookie is set. After that you can use the snippet from the django docs to get the csrf token value from the cookie
[15:08:27] <serafeim> this thing `const user = await fetch('/user/', { credentials: 'same-origin' }).then(resp => resp.json())` will return a 403 if the user hasn't been logged in
[15:09:11] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com)
[15:09:18] <serafeim> the 403 doesn't set the cookie.
[15:10:31] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:11:50] <serafeim> here's my login code: https://dpaste.org/XwvG
[15:11:54] <knbk> it should... the decorator doesn't care what the response code is
[15:12:05] <serafeim> i'm doing the get. and then the post. but i can't find the cookie anywhere
[15:12:29] <serafeim> knbk: yes i have observed that the cookie is not set even if it returns a 200-ok response
[15:12:35] <knbk> are you running django and the frontend on the same port or a different one?
[15:12:41] <serafeim> different port
[15:12:47] <knbk> well, there's your problem
[15:12:48] <serafeim> 8000 django 8001 f-e
[15:12:50] <serafeim> knbk: :)
[15:12:53] <serafeim> so
[15:13:05] <serafeim> how can i pick the csrf token value ?
[15:13:57] <knbk> you'll need more to get cookie-based sessions working cross-origin
[15:15:20] <knbk> hm, I can't find any good resources on that right now
[15:16:13] <knbk> this package would be a good starting point, seems like they also link some other resources: https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers
[15:16:23] <serafeim> uh oh
[15:16:48] <knbk> it might be easier to run everything on the same host/port :)
[15:17:08] <serafeim> ha ha yes i know
