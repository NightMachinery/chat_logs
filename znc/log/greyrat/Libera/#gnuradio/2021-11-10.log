[00:08:47] <Yamakaja[m]> luisherasme: Well, there are multiple approaches. The most common one would probably be the AGC + Costas loop
[00:08:54] <Yamakaja[m]> * AGC + Carrier Tracking + Costas loop
[00:09:07] <willcode4[m]> blue94: True, the simple YAML code that specifies that block in the GUI doesn't have many parameters. I you want to take a look at the SoapySDR interface, and the `soapy_limesdr_source.block.yml` file in our code, you might be able to make a quick change to enable antenna selection (and we can merge it back in).
[00:09:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> blue94: I don't know about the SoapyLime soruce, but the *generic* Soapy source absolutely has a spot for Antenna setting.
[00:09:45] <Yamakaja[m]> luisherasme: Have you considered using a chanel model and not dealing with timing / frequency / phase sync? What is your channel model that you're trying to test against?

[00:23:01] <Yamakaja[m]> luisherasme: I suppose that makes for the better demo, though that problem is rather tangential to what you're actually trying to do. I suggest you first get things going in a suitable channel model (AWGN + maybe some multipath?) and then read up on synchronization techniques / take a look at some other example flowgraphs where people have used the costats loop and other blocks for synchronization

[00:31:23] <luisherasme[m]> <Yamakaja[m]> "luisherasme: I suppose that..." <- The ML technique that I'm using is KNN, It is already implemented. I know because of simple intuition that if I generate a data set like a constellation diagram where noise is AWGN there will be no performance difference between a normal QAM demodulator to a KNN-QAM demodulator, but I want to test it in a real scenario. The radio part have been harder than i though.
[00:31:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> Usually with things like this, it's not the underlying DSP "engine" that's broken (sometimes it is), but rather ones fundamental understanding of what's supposed to happen.
[00:32:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> For example, folks trying to use an NBFM demodulator on WBFM signals.  Misundetstanding how sample-rate conversions are supposed to work, etc, etc.
[00:32:39] <blue94[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: oh yeah thats me
[00:33:18] <willcode4[m]> blue94: We don't have the resources to build dot-net wrappers. It could make a good project for someone to try though. I don't know if there would be a huge amount of demand for it.
[00:34:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> For example if one block thinks samples are arriving at X and another at Y, unless there's an EXPLICIT rate conversion, things will be horrible.  Gnu Radio has no *inherent* notion of sample rate.  It simply ships samples around.  ANy notion that blocks have of sample rate are kind of "interior".

[06:06:19] <luisherasme[m]> That's the minimum 
[06:06:26] <luisherasme[m]> 50MHz
[06:08:06] <muaddib[m]> You have samp_rate set at 128k as a fixed variable and your using that in the block. Have you changed it?
[06:08:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> luisherasme: Looks like that particular Source doesn't provide antenna input selection.  Too damned many different APIs for LimeSDR.    The Lime chip has several different antenna inputs that the RX (or TX) chain can be connected to.  If your physical antenna is on one of them, but the RX chain is actually connected to one of the others, you'll be almost deaf

[06:28:44] <luisherasme[m]> English is not my first language 
[06:29:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> Whether this is a problem depends on the DDC architecture inside the radio.
[06:29:51] <muaddib[m]> Right. Which is why I was unsure the relevance of my statement.
[06:30:02] <muaddib[m]> Just more of a spidey-sense thing
[06:30:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> For example, SOME USRPs have a fixed sampling rate "up front", with corresponding anti-alias analog filters after the mixer, and can then deliver any sample rate that is an integer fraction of the master clock/sample-rate.
[06:31:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> If this were my problem, I'd sent a narrow CW tone on the TX side, and see how big it is on the RX side at various gain settings on both sides.  It's easier to debug RF problems with the signals themselves are "simple".
[06:33:37] <muaddib[m]> luisherasme: given that you‚Äôre examples work ‚Äúin the box‚Äù without any hardware involved it certainly seems to suggest that the hardware involved should be tested with a simpler baseline as patchvonbraun suggested.

[06:58:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> OK, so path loss between those two antenna is going to be probably no more than 25dB or so.  So if the TX is putting out let's say +5dBm at max RF gain, the RX antenna should be seeing about -20dBm, which is a thundering huge great signal.

[07:30:02] <luisherasme[m]> Now I'm thinking that the constellation diagram was not working. When we see the constellation with the four corners more or less well-defined, that's because when the received signal is saturated it only output values in the maximum and minimum (1, -1) and (1j, -1j) forming a constellation diagram (like qpsk or 4-qam) that seems to be working, but it is not.

[13:11:10] <jemius> No seriously, this is just some sort of research. I want to see what's possible. There is a concept: Dynamically rearranging filterbanks to achive different hopping nets / behaviors
[13:11:17] <Yamakaja[m]> I'm sorry but i can't really help you if you're not sure what you need ... a lot of design decisions need to be made with the targeted system performancei n mind
[13:12:23] <Yamakaja[m]> Do you want to maximize hop rate, or maybe build something that just sort of hops around now and then and has some other interesting characteristics?
[13:12:39] <jemius> I can't be sure what I need because it is my task to evaluate what's possible with GR. The question to answer is: Can you do frequency hopping with polyphase-filterbanks in GR, and if so, how fast can you do it?
[13:12:58] <jemius> Yamakaja[m], more of the later. The goal is not maximum hopping rate, but dynamically changing behavior "now and then"
[13:12:59] <Yamakaja[m]> I see
[13:14:35] <jemius> Does a block come to mind in whose code you can find some inspiration according message ports?
[13:14:48] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, it's certainly possible to do FH with a channelizer, you'll have to write a block to feed the channels appropriately though. On that note, have you considered just upconverting the different signals from baseband to the target frequency? (np.exp(1j2np.pif_targett) * signal_vector)

[13:15:29] <jemius> Matrix bridging ist just wonderful ^^
[13:15:40] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh, i can imagine :D
[13:17:38] <Yamakaja[m]> Though i suppose your goal is to evaluate polyphase filterbanks in GR ... so maybe not ^^. I can't really help you with those, i've never used them and don't know the theory behind them. Regarding message ports, maybe i'll take that back and you try to figure out roughly what rate you're trying to hop at, and how the GUI should interact with your application. Pressing a button to change frequency isn't really what i'd call frequency
[13:17:38] <Yamakaja[m]> hopping
[13:18:35] <Yamakaja[m]> But using the GUI to change the hop pattern would be pretty reasonable, though for that you probably don't need message ports
[13:19:51] <jemius> You know, you don't really understand the polyphase filterbank... Ultimately.... the polyphase filterbank understands _you_
[13:20:06] <jemius> "If you stare too long into an abyss, the abyss also stares into you" ‚Äì Nietzsche
[13:20:28] <Yamakaja[m]> lol
[13:21:30] <jemius> Took me 10 weeks to understand those ridiculous structures. A big reason is that you only ever see the optimized implementations, and through optimization very important derive-steps are not visible anymore

[13:28:37] <jemius> But we agree that message-ports are the best way to instruct a block to change its behavior (speaking very generally, not focused on FH) from the flowgraph?
[13:28:44] <Hoernchen> lol
[13:29:12] <Yamakaja[m]> Uh, not necessarily. Using runtime configurable parameters is probably the more common approach

[13:30:18] <jemius> Yamakaja[m], hm, not a bad idea
[13:30:21] <Yamakaja[m]> jemius: it really depends on what you want to do. Think of messages as events, not parameters
[13:31:07] <jemius> Yamakaja[m], but when implementing those in C++ they are different from static parameters because they don't enter your block through the constructor, right?
[13:31:13] <Yamakaja[m]> If you want an integer parameters that changes which frequency you're currently operating at, a GUI Range + runtime parameter seems like the better option. If you want to send out a message with a button press, a message port might be the way to go
[13:31:31] <Yamakaja[m]> jemius: You'll have to provide a callback that is triggered with the updated values
[13:31:40] <Yamakaja[m]> s/triggered/called/
[13:32:04] <jemius> Yamakaja[m], do you have an example (url) at hand?
[13:32:38] <Yamakaja[m]> https://github.com/Yamakaja/gnuradio/blob/feature/gr-iio-tdd/gr-iio/grc/iio_ad9081_sink.block.yml#L284-L308
[13:33:18] <jemius> thx!
[13:33:38] <Yamakaja[m]> As you can see most parameters are initialized during construction, but are also listed as part of the callbacks. The callbacks section allows GRC to take updated values (From a range slider for example) and give those back to your blocks dynamically
[13:33:50] <jemius> Ok, as I see it the main difference is: With message blocks other blocks in the flowgraph could trigger a behavior change, with a dynamic parameter only the user can via GUI
[13:34:43] <Yamakaja[m]> Yeah, dynamic parameters are mostly used for the GUI, while message ports can be used for GUI stuff and also for blocks to communicate between themselves
[13:35:12] <jemius> cool
[13:38:04] <Yamakaja[m]> (Keep in mind that "runtime configurable parameters" are a GRC concept relying on callbacks. If you write your own GNU Radio application from scratch you can obviously invoke those callbacks any way you like, ignoring certain concurrency issues and stuff ;) )

[19:50:15] <miek> fwiw, -5 is LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND which is meant to mean that the requested interface doesn't exist. i'd expect LIBUSB_ERROR_BUSY if something else was using it

[21:49:23] <willcode4[m]> mwk088: You didn't really give any context, so probably nobody knows what the question is.
[21:54:35] <willcode4[m]> If you're doing `modtool bind` and it only looks in one dir, you could always symlink files there.
[21:56:36] <willcode4[m]> `modtool bind` has a `--addl-includes` option. Did you try that?

If you add an additional directories inside the top level include directory and want to bind those, it doesn't see the header file when using the gr_modtool bind.  --help doesn't really help with this problem.
