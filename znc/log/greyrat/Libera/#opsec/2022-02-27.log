[03:13:57] <Joanna> The reason architecture is so standardized is because of cheap fossil fuels. It’s very easy to build and destroy buildings so buildings have become disposable. It’s also cheap to make poorly designed buildings usable thanks to cheap electricity and natural gas. The long distance transportation of building materials as they said discourages the usage of local materials.
