[15:53:02] <GoSox> I am having an odd problem on a web page where my div's are rendering as inline. Even if I expllicitely declare "display: block". and the thing is, even if you look at the computed styles in the dev tools, it shows as block. Yet on screen, they are rendering as inline. Is there some feature i might be using that is making all downstream div's inline inadvertently?
[15:54:28] <stenno> `testcase
[15:54:28] <Selvvir> stenno, a (pared-down) testcase is a page that isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styling and scripting. See `paste for services that easily let you create such testcases for others to see.
[15:54:46] <stenno> `paste @ GoSox
[15:54:46] <Selvvir> GoSox, These live pastebins allow us to see what you're seeing http://jsfiddle.net/ • http://codepen.io/ • http://paste.asmcbain.net/ • Screenshots can't be inspected with website debugging tools
[15:55:33] <GoSox> i know i know, its going to take me a while to makeup a test case, i was just wondering if there isn't some known, semi common way you can have this happen
[15:55:41] <stenno> NO
[15:55:44] <stenno> no*
[15:56:00] *** Joins: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org)
[15:56:07] <stenno> some flexbox stuff maybe
[15:56:23] <GoSox> hmmm, these divs are children to flex box stuff
[15:56:29] <GoSox> though they aren't directly "flexed"
[15:56:55] <stenno> they are automatically 'flexed' when they are children of a container with display: flex
[15:57:01] <stenno> but i am not in the mood of guessing
[15:57:56] <GoSox> so how do you make a display: block element inside of a flex box container?
[15:58:23] <stenno> its block by default
[15:58:31] <stenno> depends on your setting of the flex parents
[15:58:40] <stenno> order: row and stuff
[16:01:46] <stenno> https://jsfiddle.net/v16a8wn0/ GoSox
[16:03:00] <stenno> but your issue might be something completely different, we don't know your markup and css so we cannot really help you apart from guessing
[16:03:09] <stenno> and as i said above, i am not in the mood for guessing

[18:35:38] <entuland> GoSox, they're not inline, they're flexed - the parent has display: flex;
[18:36:06] <entuland> so they're display: block, but they're arranged in a flex row layout
[18:36:44] <entuland> the li>div at line 16 is making their parent display: flex
[18:37:31] <GoSox> derp
