[20:40:01] <pingpongball> It appears you have configured your web browser to use this Tor port as an HTTP proxy.
[20:40:29] <pingpongball> This is not correct: This port is configured as a CONNECT tunnel, not
[20:40:29] <pingpongball> an HTTP proxy. Please configure your client accordingly.  You can also use HTTPS; then the client should automatically use HTTP CONNECT.
[20:41:45] <pingpongball> Is there `HTTPSTunnelPort` for torrc?

[20:44:09] <pingpongball> Hi Fling :)
[20:44:37] *** Quits: epistax (~brian@70.109.129.135) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:44:38] <pingpongball> I'm getting error when running things inside some apps such as emacs.
[20:44:55] <pingpongball> I'm sure because of my misconfigured tor
[20:44:56] <fling> like coffee machine errors?
[20:45:14] <pingpongball> This error `This is an HTTP CONNECT tunnel, not a full HTTP Proxy`
[20:45:28] <fling> torsocks -i emacs
[20:45:44] <fling> don't use https port
[20:45:47] <pingpongball> aummmm oh i'll try
[20:46:53] <pingpongball> Hello fling I cant connect there
[20:46:59] <pingpongball> throws these in output
[20:47:03] <pingpongball> 1643130988 WARNING torsocks[16865]: [connect] Connection to a local address are denied since it might be a TCP DNS query to a local DNS server. Rejecting it for safety reasons. (in tsocks_connect() at connect.c:191)

[20:48:37] <fling> does it work though?
[20:48:44] <fling> can't connect where?
[20:49:19] <pingpongball> I'm running restclient.el, kind of like postman in emacs.
[20:49:50] <pingpongball> and from there i couldnt connect those calls like
[20:49:51] <pingpongball> `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/login`
[20:51:58] <pingpongball> i thought using HTTP based tor, things wouldnt detect i'm using socks
[20:52:33] <fling> can't connect to 127.0.0.1 with torsocks or tor
[20:52:42] <pingpongball> torsocks
[20:52:48] <fling> tor is for something on the internets, not for your local address
[20:53:05] <fling> try using a public ip instead?
[20:54:18] <pingpongball> I wanted to go all my system programs, whichever they take internet go through my tor http proxy. making public ip is bad
[20:54:37] <fling> this is not how you use tor
[20:54:56] <fling> torsocks -i wget https://google.com
[20:54:58] <fling> this works ^
[20:55:06] <fling> but for browsing you should consider using tor browser
[20:55:31] <pingpongball> oh this also didnt worked :/
[20:55:35] <fling> and for your system programs consider using netfilter probably with nftables to block access to the internets
[20:57:32] <pingpongball> umm m thanks . Have a nice day.

[20:58:35] <fling> don't expose yourself by letting unaware apps thorough a proxy
[21:01:44] *** Joins: epistax (~brian@70.109.129.135)
[21:02:59] <pingpongball> fling , I've had gnome-network manager previously and i removed whole de and installed wm. In gnome network manager i could just go to settings>network>proxy  and change proxy to tor.
[21:03:38] <pingpongball> But i'm not able to do this in barebone wm. I've installed those networkmanager, nm-applet, connection-editor, but i couldnt see, where had i put that tor proxy
[21:05:41] <fling> don't change your proxy to tor
[21:05:56] <fling> use torbrowser instead
[21:06:08] <fling> and block other networking with netfilter
