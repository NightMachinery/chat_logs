[00:13:57] <taeaad> The first picture on this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology says: "This graph of a polynomial is closed."
[00:14:15] <taeaad> Why is it closed? What is the set of prime ideals here?
[00:14:50] <Z-module> Don't they mean the graph as a subspace of R^2 ?
[00:14:56] <Z-module> (nothing about ideals of any kind)
[00:15:05] <Z-module> oh, I guess they don't
[00:19:10] <taeaad> It should be under the Zariski topology.
[00:19:42] <taeaad> Which means an open set is a maximal set of prime ideals containing some ideal I.
[00:19:44] <Capso> nejimban: If X_j are independent and I fix X_1 = x, then on this condition, it's true that X_2 - X_1, ..., X_N - X_1 are independent? It seems as that's just X_j - x, they ought to be
[00:19:58] <taeaad> But that picture is just given without any details.
[00:20:37] <Z-module> yeah, it doesn't make much sense in this picture

[00:42:52] <Z-module> taeaad: well, it does say down there, "If X is an affine algebraic set (irreducible or not) then the Zariski topology on it is defined simply to be the subspace topology induced by its inclusion into some A^n", so in this case, if p(x) is the particular quintic polynomial, then they mean the algebraic set in A^2  { (x,y) : y - p(x) = 0 }  to specify that graph. So if A is C or R, that graph is certainly closed as a subspace of C^2 or

[00:52:03] <Z-module> taeaad: yeah, this is the Zariski topology on varieties, not on prime spectra of rings. An unfortunate nomenclature overlap.
[00:52:40] <Z-module> (and of course is f:R -> R  or  f: C -> C  is continuous, then its graph is always a closed subset of R^2 or C^2, respectively)

[04:09:07] <johnkeats6> the Dirac field, which describes massive spin 1/2 particles, is (_classically_) a section of a spinor bundle (over spacetime, which is usually R^4, so the bundle is usually necessarily trivial)
[04:09:27] <johnkeats6> the electromagnetic potential is a connection on this bundle

[05:48:58] <PlanckWalk> Although, in *practice* we can't even do everything that a Turing machine can do.
[05:49:16] <droid3> Well PlanckWalk its a border between physics , theorectical computer science , math ,formal language theory ...etc
[05:49:23] <PlanckWalk> All state is bounded.  All inputs are bounded.  All runtime is bounded.
[05:49:26] <dude12312414> there are some highly hypothetical ways you could do hypercomputation, but yeah it depends on physics that is just wild speculation
[05:50:04] <PlanckWalk> So it's really more of a question about efficiency
[05:50:08] <dude12312414> a fun one I heard of was to use "Malament-Hogarth spacetimes"
[05:50:14] <dude12312414> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malament%E2%80%93Hogarth_spacetime
[05:50:41] <droid3> well we can if we restrict to finite tape turings machines but ya that a serious restriction and brings us to more restrictive computing models like finite automaton /finite state machines as we all know.
[05:50:54] <PlanckWalk> Quantum computation doesn't give you anything beyond what Turing machines can do, either.
[05:51:07] <PlanckWalk> But maybe it can be slightly more efficient.
[05:51:53] <droid3> ya i know interms of a broader range of "computable functions" but for time complexity /runtime it sure does.
[05:52:22] <PlanckWalk> (But we don't even know that for sure)
[05:52:52] <droid3> Well why do you say this because of NP vs P problem
[05:53:56] <droid3> because it sure a better means of parrellel computing if we can achieve it in a practical way over gpu but this is speculation because i not familar with quantum computer hardware just some of the theory.
[05:53:57] <johnkeats6> using the bekenstein bound + the positive cosmological constant it's possible to put a bound on the maximum number of bits that could ever be used in a physical computation
[05:54:08] <johnkeats6> and it's finite. something like 10^120 iirc.
[05:55:05] <droid3> 10^90 for like the most computing we could do on earth before we run out of both time and space at least thats the estimate cooked up.
[05:55:40] <PlanckWalk> Yep, and in computability terms that's just a finite automaton.
[05:56:02] <PlanckWalk> In fact, not even that.  Finite automata are allowed unbounded runtime.
[05:56:21] <droid3> so chess can never be full enumerated and brute force or even worse go. But we got alpha-beta pruning that might help use cut that enumeration to theoretical enough to skim by.
[05:57:15] <droid3> But doubtful still :)
[05:57:55] <johnkeats6> PlanckWalk, but if you have a finite memory, isn't unbounded time pointless? at some point you have to loop back to a previous state
[05:58:23] <PlanckWalk> johnkeats6: Not completely.  E.g. classifying very long strings.
[05:59:38] <PlanckWalk> "Is the input string part of this regular language" can be solved by a finite automaton for unbounded string length.
[05:59:55] <droid3> finite memory and unbounded time is not pointless depends on the model of computing as well johnkeats6 but in certain models of computing it would be pointless
[06:01:23] <PlanckWalk> At any rate, we certainly have computation methods that are more efficient than Turing machines.

[06:05:48] *** dogbert_2 is now known as dogbert2
[06:06:16] <droid3> My curiosity is sense busy beaver grows faster then any computable function in existence. I am wondering if there is levels of uncomputablity functions of greater orders of difficulty
[06:06:44] <droid3> by difficulty i mean orders of infinite of computational complexity
[06:08:04] <droid3> sure all computable functions have runtimes of finite complexity weather there polynomial , exp , super exp , log , log log ,...etc
[06:08:34] <droid3> But for uncomputable function is there a level /classification of hierarchies for there complexity ???
[06:09:31] <dude12312414> it seems highly dependent on the specific model of hypercomputation you are working with
[06:09:42] <dude12312414> The Halting problem could be O(1) if you have a halting oracle
[06:10:54] <droid3> Because it seems busy beaver problems are the only semi-attainable uncomputable problems that can be programmed to some extent. Being as there slightly like a recursive enumerable function yet the turing machines that have to be verified some maybe undecidable
[06:12:32] <droid3> ya if where talking hypercomputing in that sense dude123124414 then there is levels of oracles based on the fact that an oracle machine cannt determine halting other oracle machines in general
[06:13:18] <droid3> its like halting problem proof but applied to oracles to get different levels of oracles sure
[06:14:52] <droid3> Also another problem i got with busy beaver problems is when i run my code i can verify the first 3 say busy beaver numbers. But how do we know if we keep going up in values that we will always beable to weed out the infinite loop turing machine choices ????

[06:17:35] <droid3> Sure for the first few values its not to hard to make a theoretical proof to weed out which turing machines halt and which dont but thats luck because we dont got to much infinite loop turing machines to check
[06:17:39] <PlanckWalk> At some point there won't even *exist* a formal proof.

[06:18:07] <PlanckWalk> Rephtasing, for any given formal system of proof, there will be an upper bound on how many busy beaver numbers it can prove.
[06:18:26] <droid3> and they happen to be all easily determined which is not the general case and i imagine going higher in the busy beaver numbers it get harder to proof a infinite loop turing machine that can be thrown out

[07:14:57] <qergle> i don't know enough about this to speak even semi-intelligently about it
[07:15:09] <himesama> qergle: i'd like to keep this as a math problem, so that we separate concerns and so that the disussion does not confuse anybody (read: me).
[07:16:12] <droid3> I say if you want to create an approximation formula for this unit or similar units drill a hole in the side and insert your anemometers/manometer similar to what you do in hvac when you do combustion test with a combustion analyzer device stuck in the exhaust vent hole you drilled
[07:16:23] <himesama> (the operative term however is pressure drop.  the ac, uknown to me at time of purchase, has more slats on the bottom to let in air.  this is really annoying for creating a good filter.  i will hafve to probably tape those slats.  this reduces total area.  but i don't want to harm the unit with too much pressure drop.  so i want to know how much i am GAINING from removing the plastic cover.)

[07:18:15] <droid3> O this is a unit you dont want to screw up aka not a research/experimental unit to get the accurate numbers/stuck on hvac units by manufactures
[07:19:04] <droid3> well do you know the cfm of the blower motor of the ac unit ???
[07:19:10] <himesama> no
[07:19:47] <droid3> if so then you could count the number of vent holes and approximate by knowing the cfm rating
[07:20:10] <droid3> hummm no way then i say you have to work out the cfm with a test device like a manometer/anaometer
[07:20:22] <himesama> hmm, was hoping there were soime kind of tiling problem upper bound lower bound things here that i could go by
[07:20:38] <droid3> because its dependent highly on the cfm of the fan in the unit
[07:20:51] <qergle> what's the operative metric, pressure differential?
[07:21:17] <droid3> ya do you know the pressure and not the current because if you know the pressure that one thing
[07:21:52] <droid3> but if you dont know cfm how do you know the pressure or how are you measuring pressure that equally a challenge without tools/equipment ???
[07:22:39] <droid3> but if you got one there is bernoilli like aerodynamic equations to get the flow rate from the pressure differential?
[07:23:36] <droid3> But in the end you need to compute the cfm or flow rate then just divide by the number of vent holes to get the flow thru a given vent hole per unit of time.
[07:23:52] <droid3> Aka the flux
[07:24:40] <droid3> Anyway without tools and knowing the pressures, flows ,...etc i dont see of a practical good way of doing it maybe others do though all leave it at that hope it helps
[07:25:26] <himesama> i am wnting to estimate very roughly the pressure drop of the holes by figuring out what proportion they take up of the plane.   using test devices, drilling holes is not in the cards at this time for reasons unrelated to this discussion.  a back of hte envelope calculation using just math will give me a astart.  i have to have  better filter on it for reasons unrelated to this discussion.  so it is going to occur r
[07:25:26] <himesama> egardless.  one question is whether i am going to have to get fancy with some kind of metal or thick plastic contraption to hold big filters outside the unit, or if i can get away with a smaller filter and taping the slats.  i was thinking "oh hey ##math might have some upper and lower bounds on circles in a regular pattern like this". then i could get my rough estimate.
[07:25:36] <droid3> I am sure the manufacture would know the cfm rating or maybe its inside on a sticker on the blower motor... it be odd not to have that rating on a blower motor
[07:26:03] <Fangs> himesama: did you read what I said?
[07:26:28] <droid3> cfm are key on such device so maybe its not labeled on the ac unit but internally on the blower motor. I would think its odd not to label cfm for an ac unit but thats just me.
[07:27:04] <himesama> Fangs: yes, but i did not fully understand it yet and will need to get a ruler to have it measured

[07:28:30] <Fangs> himesama: now its just a matter of determining how big the hole is relative to the hexagon (because ofc holes of different radius will give a different proprtion of the hexagon)

[07:31:00] <Fangs> himesama: for the sides of the hexagon, you should use the distance between the center of the holes (or if you're measuring from the 'right most side' of a hole, you should measure to the corresponding 'right most side' of the next hole)
[07:31:06] <Fangs> (i.e. same point on each hole)
[07:31:18] <himesama> ok
[07:31:39] <himesama> but why are we measuring anything at all?  wouldn't the whole thing scale to any size?
[07:31:57] <himesama> or is it a question of the closeness of the holes?
[07:32:23] <Fangs> himesama: you need to know the size of the hole relative to the hexagonal tiling
[07:32:41] <himesama> to account for the plastic in between?
[07:32:51] <Fangs> between each holes?
[07:32:52] <Fangs> yes

[07:33:20] <Fangs> (wide.. or w/e)
[07:34:15] <Fangs> as you make it bigger the grater will let more and more air through until eventually each holes overlaps.. that corresponds to not having any grater

[07:43:37] <himesama> but in practice the picture above
[07:43:41] <Fangs> you have a plane tiled hexagonally by holes
[07:44:06] <droid3> PlankWalk i know we talked about turing machines and related stuff tonight. But curious how general as of current can we build a machine.
[07:44:53] <droid3> If we havent built a most general turing machine whats the most we got to ??? pushdown , finite automaton , ....what is are most general supercomputers and equipment
[07:44:54] <pikapika> Those are circles in a hexgonal tiling
[07:44:57] <pikapika> and some space between them
[07:45:23] <pikapika> droid3, a full turing machine or even pda would require infinite memory
[07:45:27] <pikapika> In practice anything we have is finite
[07:45:48] <pikapika> In practice everything is a full tm anyways, assuming the memory can grow
[07:46:14] <himesama> pikapika: yes, i think
[07:46:27] <droid3> so what do we have a finite pushdown machine , finite turing machine , ...etc if we now just add the stipulation of finite memory /tape to these theoretical machines.
[07:47:18] <himesama> Fangs: so i measure radius of circle and distance between center of holes, and i can get area of circle from radius, and someplace there is a formula for area of hexagon from side.  then the proportion i want is ... derived from area of circle and area of hexagon?
[07:47:24] <droid3> what exactly is are laptops , desktops , phones , supercomputers interms of model of computing / bounds of its computable functions
[07:47:36] <droid3> thats the question PlanckWalk
[07:48:39] <droid3> Because we have so many different computer/electronic device out there i like to know what levels/categories we reach into in practice for these theoretical models of computing
[07:49:03] <droid3> Not a big deal not to know but just curiousity
[07:49:07] <himesama> surely those are all the same (von neumann architecture possibly made irrelevantly more complex with multiuple cores and threads and little things like that but basically the same)
[07:49:51] <droid3> As it seems are computers can do any practical turing machine algorithm we want to do
[07:50:29] <droid3> Ya so what does von neumann arch fall into interms of finite automaton or turing  based machines
[07:50:52] <himesama> well there is no infinite tape, and there is limited speed (idk if that was ever specified)
[07:51:36] <himesama> there is also church's lambda calculus for those interested
[07:51:39] <droid3> because it seems like we can do any thing we want practically to get at computing any turing based machine algorithm we want on these things... Or any practically relevant algorithms
[07:52:05] <himesama> the church-turing hypothesis is sort of like that
[07:52:25] <droid3> but lambda calculus and turing machines are at the same level of computing and can be proven equivalent models of computing.

[08:45:56] <droid3> I knew about how to do that but i never knew given the constraint of the system being von neumman what the set of all computable functions/algorithms would be.
[08:46:12] <PlanckWalk> von Neumann makes no difference to computability of algorithms, at all.
[08:46:36] <droid3> In comparison to the other levels /models of computing like the more general turings , finite automaton ...etc
[08:46:39] <PlanckWalk> Computability is a concept way more abstract
[08:47:48] <PlanckWalk> von Neumann vs Harvard architecture for example differs in fiddly details like whether the instructions and mutable data come across the same wires.
[08:47:54] <droid3> So i guess then what i was after is comparing the models of computing out there interms of what computable functions they incorporate.

[09:34:28] <himesama> i lost Fangs
[09:34:39] <Fangs> sup
[09:34:44] <Fangs> sorry I was in a call
[09:34:50] <himesama> hi :)
[09:35:25] <Fangs> 13:23 <himesama> i can find the formulas surely, just not clear on the overall concept yet --- 20:17 <himesama> Fangs: so i measure radius of circle and distance between center of holes, and i can get area of circle from radius, and someplace there is a formula for area of hexagon from side.  then the proportion i want is ... derived from area of circle and area of hexagon?
[09:36:20] <Fangs> himesama: ok if you were tiling the plane with a hexagon with no holes, then the the proprtion of the plane covered is (area of hexagon)/(area of hexagon) right?
[09:36:24] <Fangs> i.e. 1
[09:36:27] <himesama> droid3: btw hw and sw can be kind of interchangeable.  some language you can think of can have things can and /cannot/ do.  "does it have the power of a turing machine?" is a common, sometimes snarky, question applied to certain languages that one expects to be low power.
[09:36:31] <Fangs> (all of the planes are covered)
[09:36:55] <himesama> ok
[09:37:05] <Fangs> himesama: ok so now you are tiling the plane with a hexagon with some sort of a hole, then the proportion of the plane covered is (area of hexagon - area of hole)/(area of hexagon)
[09:37:13] <Fangs> if the hole is as big as the hexagon, the proprtion is 0
[09:37:17] <Fangs> i.e. you're not covering anything
[09:37:29] <himesama> ok
[09:37:35] <himesama> but the hexagon has 7 hole?
[09:37:37] <himesama> s
[09:37:39] <Fangs> ok.. so now what you want to find out is when the hole is the size of w/e circle you measured?

[09:50:29] <Fangs> himesama: the length of the hexagon is the same as the distance between two centers of holes
[09:51:02] <Fangs> but this means its the same distance between the "top most" part of the red dot, and the "top most" part of the blue dot above it
[09:51:12] <Fangs> (and I thought you've measured these two)
[09:52:00] <himesama> red?  blue?  i have no ruler yet.  length of a hexagon is edge to edge?
[09:53:10] <Fangs> himesama: you don't know how big your hexagon is, there's no hexagon on your actual grate
[09:53:18] <Fangs> but you do have the holes
[09:53:35] <Fangs> so you have to measure the length of the side of a hexagon by measuring something about the holes
[09:54:00] <cherim> As a physicist, I'd say the answer seems to be of zero use
[09:54:20] <cherim> But the lengthy discussion suggests that this opinion is not relevant
[09:54:45] <Fangs> I think they're just curious on how to do this, but again: idk if this reduction makes any sense
[09:55:06] <himesama> it sounds like i have hte answer though.  thank you Fangs.  cherim you think pressure drop cannot be approximated by area of holes?
[09:56:11] <cherim> In a model where you have a pipe with a divider, divider contains holes?
[09:56:17] <himesama> actually what i would do, which would horrify you even more, is compare the area lost to plastic between holes, to the open part of teh slats underneath the ac.  that is an additional intake area.  this really annoyed me when i found out.
[09:57:38] <himesama> i am just hoping i am freeing up enough airflow by removing the cover to make up for (depending on my design) covering the slats, and want a back of the envelope approximation to whether that is even reasonable.
[09:58:57] <cherim> Suppose that instead of the wall with small holes you had just top-half a solid metal, bottom half completely missing
[09:59:34] <cherim> Do you think such an object changes the airflow in the same way as a membrane with 50% micro-holes?

[10:37:06] <himesama> and what i can do is assume that one is an approximation of the other.  i could of course be wrong.

[14:12:42] <rendar> besides that
[14:13:24] <Galois> there is a serious issue with your statement. A vector by itself cannot be linearly dependent or not linearly dependent.
[14:13:36] <Galois> Linear dependence only makes sense for sets of vectors, not individual vectors.

[14:14:27] <Franciman> and they are always independent, except when the vector is 0

[14:14:47] <Franciman> yes, I was trying to understand the statement
[14:15:29] <Galois> if you meant something like "In a 1-dimensional vector space, is the set of all vectors in the vector space linearly dependent?" then the answer to that question is yes. But this question, although well-formed, is kind of silly. One usually doesn't take the entire set of vectors in a vector space and ask questions about whether it's linearly dependent.

[14:16:35] <Galois> the distinction between v and {v} is actually important. Many students get confused precisely because they are applying the definition of linear dependence to the wrong kind of object.
[14:16:45] <Galois> The result makes no sense, and the student is unable to sort out the confusion on their own.
[14:17:00] <greenbagels> it also helps build the thinking that prevents confusion when talking about sets of sets imo
[14:17:21] <Franciman> btw v and {v} are not necessarily different, you need the axiom of regularity
[14:17:27] <Franciman> but we are digressing
[14:17:35] <Franciman> in everyday maths we assume the axiom of regularity
[14:17:53] <Galois> if you're actually in a situation where v={v} then you're doing more advanced math than would be plausible in the context of this question.

[14:26:35] <int-e> ...in the sense that when defining the dimension of the vector space, you need to show that the dimension is unique, and that basically entails the result you want.
[14:26:58] <Franciman> rendar: what does it mean that a vector space is 1d ?
[14:27:15] <int-e> So... you need to thoroughly understand what the dimension of a vector space is.
[14:27:16] <rendar> Franciman: that each vector has only 1 component
[14:27:19] <Franciman> ok

[14:27:29] <int-e> Okay... that's *not* the concept I want.
[14:27:41] <rendar> why?
[14:27:55] <int-e> In fact that's not the concept of a vector space I want.
[14:28:15] <Franciman> rendar: so your question is only related to R
[14:28:24] <Franciman> the real numbers
[14:28:42] <int-e> Vectors should be abstract entities, not tuples. Things like R^n are merely examples of a vector space.
[14:28:57] <rendar> can't exist a vector space of 1 dimension because of its definitions on the body K, and that RxR is a body, and so on?
[14:29:08] <int-e> (over R, to keep things simple)
[14:29:21] <Galois> even if you use tuples, the span V of {(1,0,0)} in R^3 is a one-dimensional vector space, but (1,0,0) is an element of V, and (1,0,0) has three "components", so doesn't have only 1 component
[14:29:33] <rendar> int-e: indeed, i'm keeping abstract the notion of vector here, i'm also using R for simplicity
[14:30:17] <rendar> and since i'm keeping abstract the notion of vector, if V={1,2} is a vector, why V={1} can't be a vector too?
[14:31:48] <Galois> ok, there's again several things wrong with your statement.
[14:31:50] <int-e> Now that's neither abstract (you have explicit elements) nor concrete (I have no idea what the vector space operations are supposed to be).
[14:32:05] <Galois> first of all, {1,2} is the set consisting of two elements 1 and 2. This is probably not what you meant.
[14:32:24] <Galois> second of all, to be a vector or not a vector only makes sense in the context of a vector space, and you haven't supplied a vector space.
[14:32:50] <Galois> depending on the vector space in the context, a given object could be a vector in one vector space and the same object could be not a vector in another vector space

[14:38:28] <Galois> ok. I should advise you that reading alone is not enough to learh math. You have to do problems.
[14:38:32] <Galois> learn*
[14:38:45] <Galois> so, R is not a vector space ... because ... why exactly?
[14:39:11] <Galois> "There is no suitable scalar multiplication operation." <-- justify
[14:40:56] <cherim> Maybe the source rendar is reading does not use the definitions of vector space and dimension that we all assume here
[14:41:08] <cherim> Given how fast scalar multiplication gets involved
[14:41:11] <int-e> The first question in strategizing problem solving should be, "Do I understand all the terms that the problem is using?" In this case, "dimension" is the crucial term. Of course that is built on other terms, like linear dependency, and of course vectors and vector spaces. There are more terms that will pop up once you review the definitions (and that I'm quite deliberately not listing.)

[14:45:31] <int-e> Probably mind-bogglinh at this level: Verify that R is a Q-vector space, where addition is the usual one over R and scalar multiplication is vx = v h(x), where h embeds Q in R. (If you assume Q to be a subfield of R then this becomes vx = vx... and you need to understand all of the context to realize that this is not tautological, since there are different multiplications on both sides... that's...
[14:45:37] <int-e> ...math for you)
[14:45:37] <rendar> Galois: to justify it: scalar multiplication is defined about vector space and its field
[14:45:42] <rendar> if vector space has field R
[14:46:04] <rendar> then properties of scalar multiplication forces us to consider vectors with multiple components
[14:46:07] <int-e> <3 overloaded notation
[14:46:38] <Galois> ok, what is a "component"? What is the definition? This is not a standard term.
[14:46:48] <rendar> a component is a scalar

[14:47:22] <rendar> yes

[14:47:57] *** Joins: smitop (~smitop@user/smitop)
[14:48:28] <rendar> it means that vector is the element of the vector space defined on the field K
[14:48:32] <rendar> where the scalar belongs to
[14:49:30] <greenbagels> rendar: what people are trying to demonstrate to you with these questions is that there's a bottom-up approach to understanding how vector spaces are put together / structured, and that you might be missing some steps (or hand-waving them away)
[14:49:31] <Galois> ok, so for example, consider the vector v = (2,0) in R^2. Then the vector (v) is an element of the vector space (R^2) defined on the field K (R) where the scalar (1) belongs to, so 1 is a scalar in (2,0)
[14:49:31] <Galois> ???
[14:49:33] <int-e> The issue is that "component" is a concept tied to K^n (K being a field), where the vectors are n-tuples. But you just have a K-vector space, with no particular structure for the vectors.

[14:51:54] <Galois> your definition is circular. You can't use the word "components" to define what it means for a scalar to be in a vector because you're trying to define what component means.

[15:19:47] <river> There have been arguments made that logic and proofs, quantifiers without real analysis is too dry and abstract

[16:32:47] <int-e> river: ther connection to filters is this: If you identify formulas that are propositionally equivalent, then you get a lattice structure on formulas with ~ as complement False as bottom, True as top, /\ as infimum and \/ as supremum. And under that view, A becomes a set of filters on sentences and you're looking for a specific kind of ultrafilters (where for every sentence, either the sentence or...
[16:32:53] <int-e> ...its negation is in the ultrafilter)
[16:34:18] <int-e> The "specific kind" part is crucial though (that's where you ensure that the ultrafilter you get is still consistent), so using the term in this context is wholly optional.

[18:36:09] <Z-module> Hi johnkeats6, check this out, I'm annoyed at not having thought of it sooner. Let X be a set in the plane homeomorphic to O-O-O  and let's call those four three-leg intersection points in there a, b, c, d.  Now let f:R -> X  be continuous; it doesn't even need to be bijective, as long as it sends exactly one real to each of a, b, c, d.  Then the subdomain  R \ {f^-1(a),f^-1(b),f^-1(c),f^-1(d)} has 5 connected components, so f
[18:36:09] <Z-module> restricted to this set can't map onto all of X \ {a,b,c,d}  becauase this set as 6 components.  So in particular the original f can't be bijective.  QEDWTFBBQZOMG
[18:39:23] <johnkeats6> buster, i think what you were talking about photons maybe refers to how U(1) gauge invariance brings about the EM field. if you take, say, the complex klein-gordon eq, with lagrangian L = 1/2 del_mu phi del^mu phi^* - 1/2 m^2 |phi|^2, this is invariant under multiplying phi by a *constant* phase, but not invariant under multiplying phi by a phase that depends on x. then you can try to adjust the lagrangian to obtain this local
[18:39:24] <johnkeats6> gauge invariance, and it turns out that what you need to end up doing is exactly adding a U(1) connection (EM) with minimal coupling to the klein-gordon

[18:40:24] <johnkeats6> this is explained in Peskin & Schroeder, part III, chapter 15
[18:40:45] <johnkeats6> it's still at the pre-quantum level so not really 'photons', but local phase invariance => EM field is there clear as day

[18:42:42] <johnkeats6> Z-module, hmm yeah I see, that works
[18:42:43] <johnkeats6> cool
[18:42:52] <Z-module> "Under continuous surjections, the cardinality of {all the connected components} can stay the same or go down, but never up."  I'm a bit surprised that barely any books ever mention this, outside of the basic case of connected domain => connected image.
[18:43:26] <Z-module> well, I guess the former quickly reduces to the latter
[18:43:51] <Z-module> but it's still nice to keep in mind
[18:45:14] <johnkeats6> buster, the EM potential is sort of what 'communicates' to different points how to compare phases. the EM field strength is the curvature, which keeps track of how moving in an infinitesimal loop with parallel phase (but changing at each point due to the different gauges) doesn't bring you back to the same phase you started with

[18:46:50] <int-e> dextaa: Hmm, though I am wondering... why can't you just extend the signature (with a naming scheme like the one I suggested) to cope with existentials, and then take a maximal consistent set of sentences that extend Phi (using Zorn's lemma instead of the awkward sequencing)? Then do the Herbrand model thing for the atomic formulas, and then prove that it's a model... I wonder whether I'm missing...

[22:17:43] <Hash> I could wake up, do protien shake, exercise a bit, wake up th ebrain
[22:17:53] <Hash> I wonder, like statistically mathemtaically what's the best exam outcome
[22:18:03] <Hash> with factors like what time you take the test
[22:18:06] <quantum> (also, is this more of a ##math-offtopic convo.?)
[22:18:09] <Hash> is there any data on that?
[22:18:13] <Hash> there is one?
[22:18:19] <quantum> yeah
[22:18:20] <Hash> Now I gotta go repeat all thi sover there?
[22:18:22] <Hash> Oh man.
[22:18:34] <Hash> Can we just do this this time and next time I'll go there?
[22:18:54] <specing> its a good question that probably has a good scientific answer
[22:19:45] <somiaj> I think there are too many factors, from personality traits to what other oblegations and study habbits.

[22:20:16] <Hash> Cognitive fatigue influences students’ performance on standardized tests
[22:20:32] <Hash> Danish public schools between school years 2009/10 and 2012/13, we find that, for every hour later in the day, test scores decrease by 0.9% of an SD.
[22:20:40] <Hash> Wow.
[22:21:27] <somiaj> But this is in a school setting where students are doing other things, so time is less a factor and more what else is going on. It might be less a factor if one takes a few hour break and just relaxes before the exam.
[22:22:28] <Hash> I should schedule it for 11. Wake up when  do around 8-9, eat, dress, go to exam center by 11, schedule for 11:30 (go through all the security stuff)
[22:22:37] <tolarz> wtf
[22:22:40] <tolarz> i wake up at 12:00
[22:22:44] <Hash> That's no good.

[22:23:16] <Hash> I usually wake up when the sun hits me in the morning. It's nice.
[22:23:21] <tolarz> there are people with varying chronorhythms
[22:23:24] <quantum> Honestly, I vibe with tolarz. Not being on campus has made it hard to keep a sensible rhythm this year
[22:23:35] <Hash> tolarz: sure, but  your natural rhythm is light  oriented.
[22:23:43] <Hash> Solar. invention of light screwed with the body
[22:23:47] <tolarz> also as someone with heavy insomnia, i am content with a sleep schedule that actually works
[22:24:31] <tolarz> recently, i was 01:30 in the city with someone and just enjoyed the silence
[22:24:52] <Hash> When photons no longer exite the retina, a signal is sent to the pineal gland and melatonin is secreted which sends information to the rest of the body, instructing it that it's dark outside, time to rest.
[22:24:58] <Hash> Taht's why pineal is called the third eye
[22:25:07] <Hash> Not because of some spiritual mumbo jumbo (side note)
[22:25:29] <tolarz> well, the effect of one's psyche is much greater than any melatonin mumbojumpo
[22:25:36] <quantum> This is getting pretty off-topic now (not that I can do anything about it)
