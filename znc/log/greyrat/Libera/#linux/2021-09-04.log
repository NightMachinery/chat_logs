[00:00:53] <Sauvin> cAMP, chmod +x tells the running shell that the file you're trying to run is executable. In the case of binaries, this means a loader needs to get involved; in the case of scripts, the shebang line tells the shell which interpreter to load up in order to run your script.

[00:03:15] <ayecee> but i'd have to verify that
[00:03:50] <Sauvin> Point is, you need a chmod +x if you want to run something, and in the case of scripts, you have to supply a shebang line unless you're calling the script in the way cAMP just indicated.
[00:04:00] <ayecee> yup
[00:04:25] <Sauvin> Note: the script doesn't have to be chmodded +x if you're always going to call it the way cAMP just indicated.

The VPS is running on an unknown KVM, but I've the SVM byte set (brand new AMD server) in a datacent. Can it be that the Kernels are incompatible? I think the datacenter uses an older kernel.
[00:59:23] <velix> SVM flag* (not byte)

[01:28:42] <miko> definitely buildroot ;)

[01:29:47] <gartt> jim: For someone who wants something that just works, gentoo sucks as a first distro. For someone who wants to really learn about linux, it's a great first distro
[01:29:51] <ArBoy> Zorin is good for windows and mac users
[01:30:08] <ArBoy> so I prefer Zorin or Pop os also good.

[01:37:46] <gartt> tikiwiki: That's what I'm saying. Something like fluxbox is fantastic, and very simple. DWM too sure
[01:37:58] <miko> jim: just another generic ubuntu-based distro that attempts to cater to windows and mac users
[01:37:59] <gartt> I'd like to try CWM

[01:38:48] <ODIRF> yeah
[01:38:56] <ODIRF> What do you think about MX Linux?
[01:38:57] <ArBoy> Zorin is a distro, To be honest it was bad expiereence there, But I learned from it linux, My love to linux was born there, But after using arch it was stupid distro
[01:38:59] <guest856> I am not telling it necessarely, I mean

[01:40:13] <tikiwiki> WM>DE if you are willing to put in the work
[01:40:22] <ODIRF> The best linux distro for beginners is Arch, because you can become well acquainted with bash during installation
[01:40:33] <guest856> what about freebsd? :) (just a general question)
[01:40:35] <tgarder> why would I invest in so many gigabytes of ram if my machine would only use 450mb of it, I wanna put those chips to work
[01:40:36] <ArBoy> Maybe

[08:00:30] <ayecee> you don't really learn much from lfs if everything works without a hitch.
[08:02:04] <matsaman> although it's hard to imagine why you would be figuring out your required firmware with LFS
[08:02:18] <ijr> There's almost always one issue you run into, either from a too new package version on your system or a simple mistake you made while following lfs. That's really where the learning comes in
[08:02:18] <matsaman> the point of LFS is less to have an OS installed, and more to have an OS of your own that you can redistribute
[08:02:41] <ayecee> that's not the point of LFS that i remember

[20:07:27] <lordrishav> doors_1: Yes, but officially it is GNU Hurd. People call it GNU/Hurd because it is also GNU/Linux and not GNU Linux
