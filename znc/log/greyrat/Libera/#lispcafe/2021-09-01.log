[00:01:47] <selwyn_> i´ve been learning more about these silicon photonic quantum chips and they are very cool
[00:02:08] <lotuseater> hui
[00:02:22] <selwyn_> they are building new components, such as superconducting photon detectors, for use in tier one foundry assembly lines
[00:03:29] <gilberth> What are they used for?
[00:04:06] <selwyn_> the photon detectors or the chips?
[00:04:39] <gilberth> The detectors.
[00:05:06] <selwyn_> the different paths in which the photons travel down contain some quantum information
[00:05:20] <selwyn_> i.e. the photons may be in a superposition of being in different silicon waveguides at the same time
[00:06:20] <selwyn_> and the detectors measure the photon, which is sort of equivalent to forcing the photon to ´choose´ one of the paths
[00:06:51] <selwyn_> this is a quantum mechanical measurement, which not only generates entanglement but ultimately lets you perform a general purpose quantum computation
[00:07:21] <gilberth> Spooky. And what is the application then in an assembly line?
[00:07:55] <selwyn_> perhaps assembly line is not the right word
[00:08:03] <selwyn_> i have heard ´process node´ in connection with this
[00:08:36] <selwyn_> they just want to build silicon chips to do all of this stuff, since you can make most of what you need out of silicon already
[00:08:50] <selwyn_> silicon photonics has been a thing for about 10 years now
[00:09:07] <selwyn_> what´s new is doing things with single photons
[00:09:44] <gilberth> In the manufacturing process? Or in general?
[00:09:52] <selwyn_> in the manufacturing process
[00:10:09] <selwyn_> proof of concept experiments have been done with photons for some time now, including a lot of the ingredients for this proposal
[00:10:36] <gilberth> To get a smaller feature size? I still don't get it.
[00:10:47] <selwyn_> well
[00:11:30] <selwyn_> if you are going to try and make a million qubit chip in a university clean room, it simply won´t work
[00:12:25] <selwyn_> the finished products that you get in a professional foundry are so much more ridiculously effective
[00:12:47] <lotuseater> i would say then also more precision
[00:12:53] <selwyn_> yes more precise i should say
[00:15:09] <lotuseater> that you can be nearest as possible to quantum electrodynamical calculations and predictions
[00:15:46] <gilberth> I still don't get how photon detectors come into play here. I take it, that they could kinda force the wave function to be more pronounced. At least that is was I make of it.
[00:16:13] <gilberth> * what
[00:17:18] <selwyn_> when you do any quantum computation, you have to read out the state at the end
[00:17:30] <selwyn_> by measuring it
[00:17:43] <lotuseater> with a normal computer at the end
[00:17:45] <selwyn_> in this case, the output consists of (some of) the photon detector readouts
[00:18:03] <selwyn_> i.e. whether or not a photon was detected across all of the waveguides
[00:18:10] <gilberth> Sure. That is easy to get. What I don't get how that helps the manufacturing process.
[00:18:56] <selwyn_> oh, i misspoke
[00:19:17] <selwyn_> i meant, that manufacturing single photon detectors in a silicon foundry is new
[00:19:39] <gilberth> Oh yes, now everything makes sense. ok.
[00:20:11] <selwyn_> they use superconducting materials, so they had to invent a deposition tool in order to put niobium nitride on a chip
[00:20:17] <selwyn_> which took some investment
[00:20:34] <selwyn_> but it seems to have extremely high performance characteristics
[00:20:59] <gilberth> Heh, I was thinking along the line to use measurement as a trick to etch with more precision or sth.
[00:22:03] <gilberth> Which of course wouldn't work that way.

[02:55:15] <hayley> Okay, I think I understand Pauseless enough that I would eventually come up with a working implementation. But are there any numbers on the slowdown caused by the read barrier?
[02:58:17] <gilberth> hayley: Benchmark.
[02:59:34] <hayley> gilberth: IMO not trivial, because the idea is to produce a bogus read on any pointer we read, so that we trap if we read a fromspace pointer. And this is supposed to be fast because of out-of-order execution and the CPU issuing memory accesses in parallel.
[02:59:55] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@45.86.202.65)
[03:00:00] <gilberth> I mean, take your favorite CL implementation and modify the compiler for emitting code for a read barrier and then compare run times.
[03:00:05] *** Joins: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn)
[03:00:59] <hayley> Still not trivial, as I need to take a register hostage, and insert a test to see if we actually have an object (rather than immediate datum).
[03:01:49] <gilberth> Yes, but this is what is needed for a read barrier, isn't it?
[03:02:11] <hayley> I can do it with SICL, because I wrote most of the assembly generation part, but not any other compiler.
[03:03:00] <gilberth> Is SICL ready to run some significant benchmark?

[03:04:48] <gilberth> hayley: See. So I still would suggest to modify an existing CL compiler to get realistic numbers, what is the lower bound of the cost of a read barrier.
[03:06:02] <gilberth> Everything else would be guess work.
[03:06:18] <White_Flame> hayley: performance overhead numbers that I've heard around read & write barriers are in the low single digit percentage
[03:06:26] <White_Flame> of course, most of them try to be a single instruction
[03:06:31] <hayley> Sure.
[03:07:31] <hayley> White_Flame: Right, in Java it'd be MOV <free register>, [<oop register>] but I'd need a test to make sure I don't dereference a fixnum sadly.
[03:09:01] <gilberth> Yes, so that needs another instruction, and that spare register, which could lead to more spills.
[03:09:30] <hayley> OTOH I bet we wouldn't see much code where the read barrier itself creates more spills.
[03:09:51] <gilberth> Why not?
[03:10:05] <hayley> Like, you don't usually have 14 live variables (assuming a 16 register machine).
[03:10:26] <hayley> Er, s/more spills/spills by itself/

[03:11:50] <gilberth> Well, is it only two registers with a fixed use? Anyhow, all of this is guess work land until benchmarked.
[03:12:12] <hayley> OTOH I could be in trouble as I also need a write barrier to detect escaping writes. Though e.g. the C4 collector also has a card map or something, so it is not like they only have a read barrier.
[03:13:26] <hayley> So the tag bits 001, 101 and 111 are used for objects, and we shouldn't dare dereference anything else.

[07:04:16] <hayley> Doubt it.

[07:12:42] <hayley> So, before AIUI they could ask for you to diddle servers with a court order. And (with Netfarm, for example) I can't really do anything, so the alternative is a prison sentence.
[07:13:38] <gilberth> Like I read this morning about Sony sued Quad9. And Sony has high probability of winning, given the history of jurisdiction by the very court they chose, namely and sadly the local state court right here in Hamburg. It has a long history of ruling without any technical competence.
[07:15:21] <gilberth> I mean, I read "Sony sued Quad9" .oO(What the heck for?)
[07:18:20] <hayley> The other thing to investigate today is how they handle not trapping loading null on the C4 collector. Either you add a branch to avoid it, or map the 0th page (which means you can't use segfaults as implicit null tests too).
[07:18:43] <White_Flame> well, there is an alternative to .gov.au diddling, you could shut down the service
[07:19:04] <hayley> Before they make a request, surely?
[07:19:11] <White_Flame> probably even after

[07:20:43] <White_Flame> now, if you're not technically running a service, but posting software, I doubt this much applies

[13:40:41] <kakuhen> I just learned that IDENTITY and CONSTANTLY exist in CL
[13:40:49] <kakuhen> this is why I love cl
[13:41:08] <kakuhen> im working on something that benefits from having both, and i dont have to implement it myself now 
[13:46:07] <gilberth> There also is COMPLEMENT. What is missing though is CURRY.
[13:46:29] <selwyn> alexandria has even more utilities
[13:47:58] <gilberth> No surprise alexandria is mentioned. Nah, I bring my own CURRY and RCURRY.

[13:48:29] <hayley> I need to hack some CL compiler to give me statistics on when my read-barrier-removing optimisations would work.
[13:50:08] <gilberth> What do you want to optimize?
[13:51:06] <hayley> When I can remove the "redundant" load that the Pauseless read barrier wants. i.e. if we tested that some value is immediate, no need for a read barrier, and if we load already from the value, no need to add another load.
[13:52:14] <gilberth> Sigh. Instead of charging my phone is bugging me every five seconds or so about some update. This annoys me.
[13:53:34] <gilberth> hayley: How could you be sure that once you read an immediate, it will be an immediate the second read too?
[13:55:33] <hayley> That isn't what I meant, sorry. Rather that, would we do (aref (aref x y) z) for some god-awful reason (ignoring type tests), then the outer AREF would suffice to trip virtual memory if the inner AREF result needs to be updated.
[13:56:10] <hayley> (That sequence of instructions is close enough to reading a header object and then the storage vector in SICL.)
[13:58:24] <hayley> (Not sure how well legally versed the average r/sysadmin user is, but <https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pfjtuo/australian_sysadmins_fyi_new_surveillance/hb5hbsw/> claims the powers involved can hold you indefinitely without legal representation.)
[13:58:25] -ixelp- Australian Sysadmins FYI - New Surveillance Legislation Passed in 24 Hours : sysadmin
[13:59:18] <gilberth> hayley: I see. Why don't you start with just having read barriers and contemplate optimizations later?
[14:00:23] <hayley> I probably would end up comparing to unoptimized read barriers, but identifying such patterns should be borderline trivial.
[14:00:59] <gilberth> hayley: And does this law you face really surprise you? Isn't there some high court which would abolish this law? What does the constitution say?
[14:01:21] <dave0> constitution doesn't say squat
[14:01:31] <hayley> gilberth: No, no, we don't have a constitution respectively.
[14:02:29] <hayley> One business student at my university thought it was a good idea. Probably the most ethical business student here.
[14:02:30] <gilberth> No constitution? Ok. What does the Queen say, then? ;)
[14:02:58] <hayley> "I need to search everyone's emails for life extension devices"
[14:03:27] <dave0> our privacy is not written in law.. even freedom of speech isnt ther
[14:03:46] <gilberth> dave0: Really? That's bad.

[14:04:20] <dave0> the bill got pushed through on "protect the children from child abuse something and terrorism
[14:04:36] <dave0> child exploitation
[14:04:45] <dave0> something ilke that... "wont somebody think of the children"
[14:04:59] <hayley> .oO( I don't care about the "poor little children"... )
[14:05:01] <gilberth> Oh yes, it's always children or terrorism.
[14:05:14] <ck_> or drugs
[14:06:40] <hayley> Funny that the first modern use of "think of the children" (IMO) was co-opted into a sarcastic remark about having low standards for good governance.
[14:06:44] <gilberth> Drugs? I can't remember drugs being used as an excuse for abolishing civil rights.
[14:07:40] <hayley> Once upon a time, a guy who was a Mr. Parenti apparently met a Mr. Bookchin, and in a discussion the latter said "I don't care about the 'poor little children' who got fed under communism."
[14:08:27] <hayley> That is, the modern use is an emotional appeal to cover up something worse.
[14:08:50] <White_Flame> "Would somebody please think of the profits and political optics‽"
[14:09:24] <gilberth> Yes. And who could oppose to protecting children, eh? Works.
[14:10:25] <hayley> The sarcastic use of the statement, which I could imagine was the original meaning (if it ever was said, we don't know even), is of course that feeding the poor little children is a low bar to clear.
[14:11:09] <dave0> we have no protection from the govt hoovering up our data and using it to find people of interest, like suspects or people who were at some place at some time
[14:11:25] <dave0> amricans have protection from that
[14:11:59] <White_Flame> not really
[14:12:09] <White_Flame> private business can hoover up everything, then the .gov just buys from them
[14:12:23] <White_Flame> because it's not the .gov doing the actual hoovering in that situation
[14:12:37] <hayley> gilberth: In 20 words or fewer, what is your opinion on the Clozure compiler internals?
[14:13:17] *** Quits: razzy (~razzy@user/razzy) (Quit: leaving)
[14:13:17] <gilberth> hayley: I never had a look, sorry.
[14:13:29] <White_Flame> and then there's the "Oh, we're not reading your emails.  We store them all in a permanent data vault.  But if we don't read them, we techincally don't violate your rights yet"
[14:13:31] <ck_> gilberth: see "war on drugs", that was very much intended to keep two groups of "unwanteds" from voting
[14:13:33] <hayley> Okay.
[14:13:35] <dave0> White_Flame: the police can't just go to the phone company and say "give us a list of phones that were at xyz street between 2pm and 3pm
[14:13:48] <dave0> White_Flame: they can do it here in australia
[14:13:50] <White_Flame> pretty sure they can and do
[14:14:03] <dave0> White_Flame: not constitutional in america
[14:14:08] <White_Flame> I'm absolutely sure the 3 letter agencies can and do
[14:14:21] <White_Flame> this sort of stuff is not protected by the constitution, as per the supreme court interpretations
[14:14:21] <gilberth> hayley: But, it is not too good at using registers. But there is a recent update to the compiler to be more clever about registers. Otherwise the compiler is pretty simplistic.
[14:14:54] <White_Flame> "privacy" is not an enumerated right in the USA
[14:15:52] <White_Flame> however, the government has no powers other than that granted to it by the constitution, which is the only thing holding them back. so they weasel every drop they can out of their interpretations
[14:16:43] <dave0> until very recently our constitution was extremely racist towards native australians
[14:16:52] * hayley continues to think
[14:16:59] <White_Flame> to the point where when they were setting up the secret kangaroo courts post-9/11, they literally have "secret interpretations of the law" that they do not disclose
[14:17:11] <hayley> The ABCL compiler just goes S-expression -> S-expression -> look ma JVM bytecode IIRC.
[14:17:45] <hayley> IIRC it handles unboxed data still?
[14:18:05] <dave0> White_Flame: under the banner of national security
[14:18:15] <White_Flame> of course, the biggest banner of them all
[14:18:18] <dave0> oh it comes back to the terrorists lol
[14:18:43] <gilberth> hayley: ABCL?
[14:18:58] <hayley> Armed Bear Common Lisp
[14:19:03] <White_Flame> is "aboriginal" still the preferred term for them in .au or is there something new?
[14:19:12] <gilberth> hayley: Don't you want sth generating native code?
[14:19:15] <hayley> IIRC Aboriginal, yes.
[14:19:20] <White_Flame> since "native australian" is new to me
[14:19:31] <hayley> gilberth: The JVM distinguishes between boxed and unboxed, which is good enough.
[14:20:30] <gilberth> hayley: Still you don't measure read barrier overhead for a potential native code generator.
[14:21:32] <hayley> gilberth: Sure. But the JVM eventually makes native code, and the Cleavir IR level that I'd implement it in is similar to Java bytecodes.
[14:22:05] <hayley> And, no, I am not measuring overhead, just a guess of how frequent read barriers may be.
[14:23:43] <dave0> White_Flame: a friend of mine said the word aboriginals use to refer to themselves is "koori"
[14:23:47] <dave0> i think that's how you spell it
[14:23:57] <hayley> There is a fixnum class, but ABCL happily unboxes and then adds the values inline. Hm.
[14:24:14] <dave0> "aboriginal" was a whiteman word
[14:24:20] <kakuhen> selwyn: yeah, I use alexandria:compose because I am too lazy to make my own function for composition
[14:24:41] <selwyn> well, you shouldn´t have to
[14:25:18] <kakuhen> the project im working on already pulls in alexandria as a dependency, so i may as well use what alexandria offers
[14:25:21] <kakuhen> that is how i see it
[14:26:12] <selwyn> concerned that australia is the future of britain
[14:26:39] <ck_> or the past?
[14:26:52] <ck_> isn't it currently a member of more trade agreements than the uk, for example
[14:26:55] <selwyn> well, maybe it
[14:26:55] <gilberth> hayley: Ok, when you want to just measure the frequency, anything would do. I would be more interested in the actual overhead of read barriers in general. I mean: Would it even matter in face of speculative execution? Hard to tell, without measuring it.
[14:27:10] <selwyn> it´s the past of the uk in a cutesy way, with red telephone boxes and such
[14:27:14] <selwyn> i have never visited

[18:08:39] <Jacobis9000> hi!
[18:09:01] <lotuseater> hi Jacobis9000 
[18:09:08] <Jacobis9000> The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs just arrived in my mailbox
[18:09:21] <lotuseater> cool, a big book
[18:09:21] <Jacobis9000> I thought it used Common Lisp but it uses Scheme
[18:09:29] <lotuseater> right
[18:09:37] *** Quits: razzy (~razzy@user/razzy) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[18:09:42] <lotuseater> would have told you that :)
[18:10:00] <Jacobis9000> should probably have done more research before I ordered it
[18:10:06] <lotuseater> from the newer version you can pump the code 1:1 into Racket
[18:10:19] <Jacobis9000> what's Racket?
[18:10:23] <lotuseater> yes, so you know that lection for the next time
[18:10:32] <lotuseater> Racket is a newer dialect of Scheme
[18:10:43] <lotuseater> okay not soo new
[18:10:46] <Jacobis9000> I've got the second edition of the book
[18:11:19] <lotuseater> yes I have that too
[18:11:28] <lotuseater> typed in LaTeX
[18:11:49] <Jacobis9000> so it seems LISP is a very mathematical language, do you need a certain degree of mathematical knowledge? I only have a GCSE, linear algebra is as far as I got
[18:12:14] <lotuseater> Scheme is
[18:12:20] <lotuseater> what's GCSE?
[18:12:34] <Jacobis9000> General Certificate of Secondary Education
[18:12:39] <Jacobis9000> used to be O-level
[18:12:53] <Jacobis9000> the step up where you start learning proper maths is A-level maths
[18:13:23] <lotuseater> just do maths on your own
[18:15:12] <Jacobis9000> yes I have done that recently
[18:15:27] <Jacobis9000> I hired a maths tutor last year, but I haven't kept up practice because life got busy
[18:15:28] <lotuseater> ok
[18:16:13] <Jacobis9000> do you think I should shelve Structure for now and order the Gentle Introduction to Lisp? I am reading the free edition on my ipad
[18:16:40] <lotuseater> do as you like
[18:17:06] <lotuseater> SICP gives much independent knowledge too

[18:19:54] <Jacobis9000> I have ordered Common Lisp Gentle Intro
