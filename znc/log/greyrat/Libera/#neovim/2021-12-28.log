[09:10:14] <trace987> what is better using a plugin with LSP instead of just native LSP
[09:10:32] <mjlbach[m]> there is no "native" lsp

[09:11:42] <mjlbach[m]> I don't know why people call it that

[09:12:28] <trace987> yes
[09:12:56] <mjlbach[m]> anyways, there are pros and cons to both ecosystems
[09:13:32] <mjlbach[m]> the pro of the built-in client is it's architecture makes it extremely customizable, and it gives essentially direct access to everything via overridable lua functions
[09:14:06] <mjlbach[m]> coc.nvim is an entire ecosystem of plugins, some of which are not related to lsp at all

[12:42:13] <kylo252[m]> that sounds really odd, speed shouldn't be any worse than coc as long as they're using the same server
[12:45:44] <AtBios[m]> Yep. I thought the same but there it is definitely slower with nvim lsp
[12:46:13] <AtBios[m]> Might be that coc uses something other than netcat to connect maybe?
[12:46:40] <AtBios[m]> Since nvim LSP uses netcat to hookup with the Godot server

[12:55:28] <AtBios[m]> 4.0 is not released yet. :)
[12:56:24] <kylo252[m]> your first problem might be using netcat, the second might be netcat on windows and finally it could be windows itself 
[12:56:24] <DavideP[m]> If the language server of your choice has a binary then it is usually enough to install it and configure a few things in lspconfig 
[12:56:51] <AtBios[m]> The nvim lsp suggests netcat. 
[12:57:10] <kylo252[m]> DavideP[m]: yeah, but this one seems to be bundled in the engine 
[12:57:11] <AtBios[m]> And I really think the problem might be there. Just not sure how to solve it. :(
[12:57:21] <DavideP[m]> Like lemminx (XML) requires simply this, to be installed as a binary in the path and to be called in lspconfig.lua

[13:10:26] <AtBios[m]> It has nothing to do with PATH. I was td by someone in this chat that it just does not work for some reason when using netcat scoop. Godot is fine with scoop thiugh
[13:10:46] <kylo252[m]> it's okay, but I'd need to start the engine/server independently on port 6008, at least according to lspconfig command

[13:13:07] <AtBios[m]> The sever starts with the engine

[13:47:41] <kylo252[m]> or at least pretty usable 
[13:51:27] <AtBios[m]> cmp is fine for me actually. THe slow down I have is for the diagonistics (trying to take a video soon to show)
[13:52:33] <AtBios[m]> Or well, I mean, CMP is a bit slower than coc, but nothing I notice that badly. But yeah, the auto-suggestion is slower. 
[13:52:35] <AtBios[m]> You are correct.
[13:52:54] <kylo252[m]> suggestions are pretty slow and cmp is basically unusable for me
[13:53:34] <kylo252[m]> so omnifunc seems to take like a full second to load, which is wild 
[13:53:51] <AtBios[m]> oh, wow, .okay, I don't have that bad.
[13:54:01] <AtBios[m]> I wonder if it is because you are on a VM or if something is actually broken htere.

[15:36:24] <mjlbach[m]> Yes
[15:36:57] <mjlbach[m]> Thatâ€™s the only conceivable bottleneck I can think of, bouncing through netcat is not ideal
[15:37:04] <AtBios[m]> Ah, got it.
[15:38:40] <AtBios[m]> I mean, again, it works fine. It is just error-reporting that is slow for me. I haven't actually seen a big CMP slowdown as far as I can tell. 
[15:39:00] <AtBios[m]> It is a TINY bit slower than coc for auto-complete, but I mean, tiny. :D I don't even think about that when using it.
[15:39:41] <mjlbach[m]> are you denouncing or not using update_in_insert=true
[15:39:56] <mjlbach[m]> Coc does a direct tcp connection fwiw
[15:40:04] <kylo252[m]> omnifunc is broken for multiline inserts as far as I can tell, but I'm not sure if the problem lies in the adapters or in `complete()` itself... :feelsbadman: 
[15:40:27] <mjlbach[m]> Well you should be equipped with the knowledge you need to deduce that and report back
[15:40:30] <AtBios[m]> "are you denouncing or not using update_in_insert=true" - Not using, should I? 
[15:41:09] <mjlbach[m]> Well, by default diagnostics are not updated in insert mode
[15:41:26] <AtBios[m]> Ah, yeah, that sounds good actually. 
[15:41:41] <AtBios[m]> The default I mean.
[15:41:43] <mjlbach[m]> So that would explain a perceived delay
[15:44:26] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: `cmp` is using the _actual_ compatible API with `apply_text_edits`, so that means we'd need to maintain another implementation just to do the same effect
[15:44:35] <AtBios[m]> The delay was more that it went through all diagonistc steps instead of just calling out the final one. E.g. error for x, error for y, and then realising it was correct and removing the error. After leaving insert mode.

[15:45:36] <mjlbach[m]> You can try adding a small debounce as suggested in the default lspconfig recommendations

[16:04:01] <kylo252[m]> <mjlbach[m]> "Because we donâ€™t fully support..." <- I thought I had figured out a slick way to deal with translating server settings from package.json, but this whole incompatibility threw a wrench into the works ðŸ˜¢
[16:05:37] <kylo252[m]> it would've basically removed the need for half of `docgen.lua` from lspconfig
[16:06:23] <AtBios[m]> Random question, and this might not be related to the TCP. When I press "confirm" for selecting something auto-completed on some of them I randomly get that nothing shows up. E.g. it seems to delete it, because if I undo it comes back. (Again only on Godot, so I assume something in their server setup is broken). This: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/47930
[16:06:23] <AtBios[m]> I have that even with nvim-lsp.

[16:07:34] <kylo252[m]> that's related to what I was saying that some completion items seem to be invalid, keep an eye on the terminal that's spawned by godot for any errors. that and `undo` is probably still broken in cmp
[16:08:17] <AtBios[m]> Got it! Sorry, did not undertand those were related! but since it only happens on Godot (with coc as well), this definitly sounds like  a GODOT lsp error.

[21:57:46] <vinitkumarVinitK> Hi all!... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/d11d6c4d3a3d82bb2bed35101419093f4b3b9790)
[21:58:17] <vinitkumarVinitK> How do I do this with lua in neovim. I tried searching about it but couldn't find anything.
[21:58:27] <ii14[m]> same thing
[21:58:33] <ii14[m]> though I don't know if it's a good idea
[21:59:59] <ii14[m]> it's better to just restart vim
[22:00:16] <vinitkumarVinitK> Well, I think my use case is valid, e.g. if I add a new package in my plugins, I have to restart before running `:PackerUpdate`
[22:00:42] <ii14[m]> `:so %` should work
[22:01:03] <ii14[m]> though things can get complicated if you're using `require`
[22:01:12] <vinitkumarVinitK> How do I write it in lua?
[22:01:59] <ii14[m]> `vim.cmd([[au BufWritePost something.lua so %]])`?
[22:02:50] <ii14[m]> with `require` the module gets loaded only once, so if you have something like `require('plugins')` in init.lua where you have packer and you try to reload init.lua, then that's not going to work
[22:03:04] <ii14[m]> because the `plugins` module is already loaded
[22:03:26] <vinitkumarVinitK> Ah, alright.
[22:03:37] <vinitkumarVinitK> So, no good way to do it, the?

[22:03:55] *** Joins: tufei__ (~Ngyu-Phee@gateway/tor-sasl/tufei)
[22:04:08] <ii14[m]> what you can do is evaluate only the packer file and then PackerUpdate
[22:04:17] <ii14[m]> or unload the module and load it again
[22:04:23] <vinitkumarVinitK> And indeed, my config looks like this:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/eb89be352eeac0ab70a23dc7d8faa90d6ae69083)
[22:05:27] <ii14[m]> you can unload packages with `package.loaded['plugins'] = nil` for example
[22:05:29] <ii14[m]> you could add that before those requires

[22:07:12] <ii14[m]> but you know, don't replace every require with it, because require is there for a reason
[22:07:21] <ii14[m]> just for init.lua maybe
[22:08:01] <ii14[m]> also when you have modules like `foo.bar` and do `R('foo')`, that will only reload `foo` module, not `foo.bar`
[22:08:52] <vinitkumarVinitK> Looks like this is more trouble than what it is worth.
[22:08:52] <vinitkumarVinitK> I will rather just stick to restarting my neovim
[22:09:06] <vinitkumarVinitK> It's not like I install a plugin every hour

[22:09:44] <ii14[m]> you can always create a shell alias that does just PackerUpdate and then quits
[22:10:03] <vinitkumarVinitK> That makes sense.

[22:10:56] <bfredl> I use a pattern so I clean out every module called `bfredl.*`. then I split my init.lua into packages in that namespace
[22:11:12] <ii14[m]> or `qa!` to be safe. hopefully it's not async

[23:47:39] <nzeo> How would one configure sumneko Lua.runtime.version=/LuaJIT|Lua 5.4/ depending on the project dir? Is there a way to make it read the `.luarc.json` files from nvim?
[23:48:16] <mjlbach[m]> You don't need to "read" those from nvim
[23:48:27] <mjlbach[m]> just drop it in the directory and lua-language-server will pick up on it automatically
