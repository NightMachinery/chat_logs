[23:46:11] <ska> How do you avoid technical debt from the start of a software project?
[23:49:07] <johncs> haha unusual venue for that question. i feel like ##programming might be more appropriate
[23:49:44] <ska> I agree, but I didn't see that one.. TY!
[23:49:45] <johncs> but i'd say you don't really. you do your best to minimize the debt you can balancing it amongst all the other priorities you have
[23:49:52] <johncs> gl!
