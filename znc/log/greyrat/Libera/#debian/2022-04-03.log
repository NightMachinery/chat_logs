[13:53:52] <xmb> just like i had to change in rsyslog.conf the user permissions.. maybe removing those config lines also works
[13:54:27] <xmb> termux.apk, does have user system with apt / dpkg , just havent looked at its configs
[13:54:34] *** Quits: Evrixol (~Vlad2580@user/vlad2580) (Quit: "Running in circles, dizzy.")
[13:55:07] <xmb> also regarding my plan observed, i had .6s transparent load with rt kernel, no rt kernel i guess 0 load, but without root its .1 only
[13:55:51] <Khepra> you can't remove root. even if you change your entire filesystem and re-own every file there is so your unprivileged user can behave as root, you still have uid=0 as a concept in the kernel, and privilege escalation bugs. you can't get rid of that.
[13:56:15] <Khepra> if you want to make root impotent, there is only one thing you can do: mandatory access control. things like selinux make root useless
[13:56:23] <Khepra> also:
[13:56:26] <Khepra> !based on debian
[13:56:26] <dpkg> Your distribution may be based on and have software in common with Debian, but it is not Debian.  We don't and cannot know what changes were made by your distribution (compare http://futurist.se/gldt/).  #debian only supports Debian and pure <blend>s; please respect our choice to volunteer here to help Debian users.  Support for other distributions is off-topic on #debian, even if your own distro's channel is clueless or non-existent.
[13:56:26] <xmb> im not looking to change uid 0 im looking for other name
[13:56:28] <xmb> and it works
[13:56:34] <xmb> i said i dont want contra for my plans
[13:56:40] <xmb> so either answer the simply support question i had or not
[13:56:46] <Khepra> there's "toor" on BSDs, I don't know if that concept exists on linuxes
[13:56:57] <xmb> i changed root away it works
[13:57:12] <Khepra> on linux, you can use unprivileged containers, and in them something that "thinks" is root (uid=0) is actually unprivileged, from the standpoint of the kernel.
[13:57:14] <xmb> now i have just copy root, as not first uid 0, and in ps aux it appears as the first use, not root
[13:57:23] <Khepra> well good luck breaking your system.
[13:57:28] <xmb> it *works* without root ( as other name, same uid 0 ) about your invalid 'it doesnt work'
[13:57:36] <xmb> well i wish
[13:57:50] <xmb> its the configs which dpkg user and group will use
[13:57:58] <Khepra> I never said it doesn't work, I said it doesn't do what you think it does. uid=0 still exists
[13:58:00] <xmb> termux.apk is debian alike for users on android, non root
[13:58:06] <xmb> it does this, where are the configs is my question
[13:58:16] <xmb> i said, i dont look to change uid 0 i change root
[13:58:54] <Khepra> root is uid=0. except in unprivileged namespaces/containers where "root" looks like uid=0, but the kernel sees unprivileged user.
[13:59:19] <xmb> root is an alias for uid 0 only sorry
[13:59:26] <Khepra> in other words, uid=0 in the namespace is actually some (large) number in the kernel. that's UID namespace
[13:59:37] <xmb> if u use users instead of uid's u have to mess with s/root/else - i at least as pro doer
[14:00:09] <xmb> again as last try: dpkg has user group configs that write 'root' in them, where / how to change
[14:00:13] <Khepra> problem is you're still not confining real uid=0. with selinux you actually do confine the real uid=0
[14:00:31] <xmb> i dunno selinux usage or format sorry
[14:00:35] <xmb> i ditched systemd and dbus and co also
[14:01:06] <Khepra> but that's irrelevant to your question. selinux (or, technically, MAC frameworks) are the only tools in linux to make uid=0 impotent. anything else is fake
[14:02:00] <Khepra> even teh UID namespace is faking UIDs; with selinux confinement breaking through to actual uid=0 is still impotent and has to comply with applied policy.
[14:02:04] <xmb> you dont get the positive side of a hacker not being to use 'root' text cause (halfunknown) new text ?
[14:02:21] <xmb> i dont fake dude now i have 50% of the plan, look:
[14:02:21] <Khepra> yes I do, but not in the way you want
[14:02:40] <xmb> xmb          1  0.0  0.0   3452  1948 ?        Ss   07:09   0:00 init [2]
[14:02:41] <Khepra> the only way to stop "hacker" from abusing root is mandatory access control, aka MAC; selinux is one such framework.
[14:02:50] <xmb> yea no its not the only way
[14:03:01] <Khepra> on your system, a bug can be exploited to elevate that xmb to actual root uid=0
[14:03:12] <xmb> nply mate
[14:03:17] <xmb> so on yours with root where u dont even need it
[14:03:18] <Khepra> under a selinux policy, even if you do become uid=0, you can't do anything against the policy.
[14:03:28] <xmb> yea ok so u can see it
[14:03:30] <Khepra> you still don't understand
[14:03:33] <xmb> i see it they have superior tools
[14:03:39] <xmb> that skip these imho fake protections
[14:03:53] <xmb> a 'su' doesnt work
[14:03:55] <Khepra> even if you change every "root" on your system to "xmb", your system can still elevate to uid=0. doesn't matter how uid=0 is called. uid=0 is special in teh kernel.
[14:04:07] <xmb> u have to su 'myname' as root, one small change
[14:04:19] <xmb> xmb has no /etc/shadow entry
[14:04:21] <xmb> another plus
[14:04:34] <xmb> and no /root exists, and actually root is linked to shell /no
[14:04:41] <xmb> but i want it *completly* removed
[14:04:44] <xmb> by changing dpkg configs
[14:04:45] <Khepra> that's where you're wrong. root still exists in the kernel
[14:04:46] <xmb> u dont wanna help
[14:04:49] <xmb> u explain me foo else
[14:05:08] <xmb> i give it a try till the last, so my plan
[14:05:11] <Khepra> I am explaining you that your theory here is misguided. you cannot remove uid=0 from teh kernel
[14:05:16] <xmb> when i see it completly doesnt work i change thats all i can do
[14:05:25] <xmb> i do NOT listen to 100% of 'my plan doesnt work' foo
[14:05:35] <Khepra> yes, you're right, you're not listening
[14:05:43] <xmb> i said i do not change uid 0
[14:05:45] <xmb> i change root
[14:05:45] <Khepra> you asked for advice and aren't listening when the advice is given
[14:05:59] <Khepra> "changing root" is pointless
[14:06:01] <xmb> ur advise contains -% ( less than 0% ) of code that i can use
[14:06:08] <xmb> so
[14:06:11] <xmb> u dont get my plan
[14:06:15] <xmb> u either help on the topic
[14:06:16] <xmb> or not
[14:06:27] <Khepra> I am helping you, but you simply dont' understand how linux works.
[14:06:34] <Khepra> you cannot do what you think you're doing
[14:06:34] <xmb> lol dude
[14:06:45] <xmb> ssh root@host doesnt work
[14:06:46] <xmb> a big plus
[14:06:57] <xmb> where it used to, i use passwd auth
[14:06:58] <Khepra> yeah. PrevenRootLogin in sshd_config
[14:07:07] <xmb> no not because of that
[14:07:07] <Khepra> root is still root.
[14:07:10] <xmb> yea
[14:07:12] <xmb> but it doesnt login

[14:07:45] <xmb> no idea what that 'nkran' is
[14:07:53] <Khepra> the part that you do not understand is that a bug in a program can elevate you to uid=0
[14:08:03] <xmb> i understand dude
[14:08:11] <xmb> where there is not root but normal used, it can be done
[14:08:11] <Khepra> because you're not really removing uid=0, you're only changing some name in /etc/passwd
[14:08:15] <xmb> as it defaults to kernel auth level 0
[14:08:31] <xmb> i am not looking to change uid 0 as i know my know is not ready for it

[14:13:55] <xmb> its a command to run as root i guess

[14:14:26] <quarterback> I got some startjob error. After I deleted swap partition, it was not able to boot without a usb drive. It had something to do with write caching.
[14:14:27] <xmb> well its a debian question
[14:14:34] <xmb> i m not looking to switch away from my debian
[14:14:52] <Khepra> quarterback: you can see in the journal which service had a problem on boot, and then you can further look up that service's logs
[14:15:03] <xmb> sounds like a bug fixed it new versions, and yea the failing job logs
[14:16:00] <quarterback> Khepra, I looked at journalctl but I dont understand it
[14:16:15] <xmb> maybe a look into /var/log .. i dunno where systemd stores log
[14:16:20] <quarterback> Khepra, This is on a SSD
[14:16:27] <xmb> uh
[14:16:37] <Khepra> quarterback: if you're on bullseye and by default that journald is persistent, you can run   journalctl -b    and then scroll through until you see maybe red lines that might indicate failed service on boot
[14:16:58] <quarterback> Khepra, Thanks, brb
[14:17:46] <Khepra> quarterback: also, during boot you can see on the screen which service is in "start job". remove "quiet" from the grub cmdline if you don't see systemd log entries on boot

[14:20:03] <jelly> xmb, that said I'm not sure where would be the best place to ask.  dpkg is probably not meant to be run as non-root -- package database management might be done with a usre with less permissions, but you need it to unpack a deb over / during installation

[14:48:49] <Khepra> quarterback: I also haven't run hibernate in very long tiem so I don't know what to suggest you to look at next.
[14:49:22] <quarterback> Khepra, Would recreating the swap partition help? I was able to disable swap and boot the OS.
[14:49:58] <Khepra> quarterback: help with silencing the error? yes, but you must create it with the SAME UUID. but that wont' fix the issue no
[14:50:15] <Khepra> quarterback: do you have some kind of fast boot or whatsit enabled in bios so your power off is actually a hibernation?
[14:50:44] <quarterback> Khepra, There is no fastboot. Its a old motherboard with a core2duo.
[14:50:47] <Khepra> which would fail with no swap but then I'm not sure where and how initramfs thinks it has to resume from
[14:51:14] <jelly> xmb, a 5 minute search suggests termux are patching dpkg code to allow running as non-root. https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/packages/dpkg/dbmodify_dont_require_root.patch  so, they're not using proot for termux itself, I was wrong
[14:51:15] <Khepra> quarterback: okay let's try rebuilding initramfs.      update-initramfs -u    and when it's done, reboot
[14:51:47] <xmb> thank you mate jelly lemme look
[14:51:52] <quarterback> Khepra, I got some errors like missing firmware
[14:52:23] <quarterback> Khepra, Look at this as well initramfs-tools configuration sets RESUME=UUID=5cefeead-fb4c-42ae-a855-0ef4333fa179
[14:52:31] <quarterback> Khepra, It is pointing to deleted swap partition
[14:52:32] <xmb> jelly i dont get the change, it excludes android or what
[14:52:43] <Khepra> quarterback: ah right, that it does.
[14:52:53] <xmb> sounds like a good change if i recompile my dpkg without the two if lines
[14:52:57] <xmb> i mean the getuid
[14:53:03] <quarterback> Khepra, how do I disable that?
[14:53:05] <Khepra> quarterback: you can safely remove that entry from initramfs.conf
[14:53:27] <xmb> thank you big time jelly the issue is now 100% clear to me
[14:53:30] <Khepra> quarterback: that's in initramfs.conf or in a conf.d file?

[15:04:17] <xmb> well, uh
[15:04:18] <Khepra> so can we go back to what I was saying from the beginning that this is: a) wrong thing to do,   b) fixed elsewhere with namespaces and MACs ?  thanks.
[15:04:23] <xmb> your choise to help me or not, .. :/

[15:05:17] <xmb> if, u, or debian, insists on some gay policy stating they need root, i go away from debian soon
[15:05:18] <quarterback> Khepra, I will look at the errors for missing firmware later. Thanks a lot. Appreciate your time.
[15:05:21] <kjetilho> jelly: to ensure fmb gets priority?
[15:05:27] <Khepra> even if you completely remove "root" from passwd and shadow and there's not a single file on the system with "root" in ownership, you haven't hardened your system really. uid=0 can be gained through bugs.
[15:05:31] <Khepra> quarterback: you're welcome
[15:05:31] <kjetilho> xmb: good luck.
[15:05:32] <xmb> i can just say it wont break, i need two config lines, thats al
[15:05:56] <xmb> kjetilho mate i go code my own small distro i dont need 100k packages i need few base and newest versions only, thats all
[15:06:00] <Khepra> xmb: gay policy? can you elaborate on this?
[15:06:04] <xmb> i dont say its easy, i say its essnetial

[15:06:22] <xmb> no
[15:06:24] <xmb> i meant
[15:06:26] <jelly> xmb, also, using "gay" in a derogatory way is not nice
[15:06:37] <Khepra> I'm about to descend into namecalling, jelly hold me back!
[15:06:38] <xmb> very bad policy with bugs with policies against fixes of those bugs
[15:07:02] <xmb> sorry jelly its my street slang.. another word for ' b a d ' i used it for
[15:07:26] <xmb> a policy, of stating the text root, instead of user specificable, is not much else than a policy of systems without root for owners, like android and ios
[15:07:33] <xmb> aka ' b a d 'ish
[15:07:37] <quarterback> Khepra, is there a way to display boot messages graphically?
[15:07:45] <kjetilho> xmb: I don't get what "/" is called "/" either.  I want it to be called "^".  Stupid Debian policy won't let me!
[15:07:49] <xmb> i dunno about that policy jelly stated about root , but im not lookign to break system or law, i just do secure things
[15:08:06] <kjetilho> there is no security gained by renaming UID 0.
[15:08:14] <Khepra> quarterback: what's in boot.log is displayed on the screen when you remove that "quiet" from cmdline. does it not?
[15:08:28] <xmb> i dunno why now 2x ppl told me its of no use
[15:08:30] <Khepra> kjetilho: I said that looooong time ago, but they're not listening
[15:08:39] <Khepra> xmb: BECAUSE IT IS ? :)))
[15:08:39] <quarterback> Khepra, I enabled splash in grub
[15:08:45] <Khepra> quarterback: ah, disable that too
[15:08:45] <xmb> well not for me
[15:09:02] <jelly> xmb, if your system removes some of these entries, /usr/share/base-passwd/passwd.master there's no telling what might break
[15:09:03] <Khepra> xmb: keep asking  as more and more of EU And later US wakes up to sunday, and you'll have more people telling you the same :)
[15:09:23] <jelly> xmb, so, if you break it, you get to keep all the pieces
[15:09:32] <xmb> sure thing mates i dont assume otherwise
[15:09:37] <quarterback> Khepra, Should I put quiet back in grub? There is no need to see lot of text messages at boot in ascii format.
[15:09:42] <xmb> im the admin of my sys and serv, i wont blame you for helping me
[15:09:54] <Khepra> xmb: even if you completely remove "root" from passwd and shadow and there's not a single file on the system with "root" in ownership, you haven't hardened your system really. uid=0 can be gained through bugs.

[15:13:33] <jelly> ^ that package creates a second uid=0 user, but it does NOT replace root:x:0

[15:14:49] <Khepra> xmb: btw did you know that majority of privilege exploits on linux don't even attempt to use "root" word? they go straight for uid=0

[15:15:09] <Khepra> by integer. the privilege escalation bugs are mostly done by inserting integer 0 into kernel structures of processes so the process becomes uid=0
[15:15:17] <Khepra> you cannot remove uid=0 from teh kernel
[15:15:36] <Khepra> renaming "root" to something else, doens't change the fact that exploits will continue to work by setting integer uids.

[15:15:56] <Khepra> yes that is exactly what I am talking about
[15:16:01] <kjetilho> that's right.  the kernel does if (!uid || capabilites & CAP_FOO) { do something }

[15:17:38] <xmb> makibg the root user non existing is a big security gaingment .. in every case .. if u can handle the configs .. im not looking ( yet ) at changing uid 0, .. but what should i think of u ppl, i try of security reasons to remove root u say its pointless.. uhh

[15:19:39] <Khepra> xmb: you said you removed systemd. you crippled your system because systemd is the only existing process manager that can do process namespacing, seccomp and other hardening things
[15:19:49] <Khepra> xmb: so you're cripping the security in your system
[15:20:06] <xmb> it doesnt harden by default, it has bugs, and to 100% to me unknown format so i cant make any use of it
[15:20:09] <Khepra> openrc, s6, none of the alternatives can or do use seccomp or namespacing to partition services.
[15:20:20] <xmb> im also lookibg for making cgroups away, which is i dont use systemd anyway

[15:23:37] <Khepra> this has been my point from the beginning. you're doing it wrong becuse you want to change dozens of tools instead of only one: UID namespace in which "root" isn't uid=0, so it does not MATTER if something is root:root.

[15:38:36] <xmb> i mean, for me overally, i dont need an unknown-format unknown-stuff manajor, i mean to me cgroups are security holes, and if i could use them then id use a command, not systemd, excepts maybe i know systemd but thats not an easy thing to happen
[15:38:59] <xmb> systemd has shown me x not wanted cgroup mounts
[15:39:16] <xmb> i also didnt assume otherwise than i have to do all cmds myself with sysvinit , or init=/bin/bash.init.script
[15:39:16] <Khepra> cgroups can't be security holes because they're not security boundaries. they're just process.... grouping.... with resource management
[15:39:32] <xmb> they are big things with holes mate, to me

[15:43:18] <Bushmills> I suppose systemd gained some bad reputation while init of some services weren't converted to systemd, causing them to not start properly on systemd based systems
[15:43:26] <Khepra> because THAT would be very secure thing to do.    /mega-sarcasm-ends-here

[17:32:39] <Bushmills> hm. S.M.A.R.T. is meant to do that without need of intervention, assuming spare sectors are still available
[17:33:04] <Khepra> WormFood: badblocks is in e2fsprogs
[17:33:19] <WormFood> that only works when you write to the sector. It won't remap if you only read that bad sector
[17:33:27] <jelly> WormFood, not while it's mounted, no
[17:33:52] <WormFood> jelly, what about if it's unmounted?
[17:33:54] <jelly> badblocks and fsck work on umounted ext4 filesystems
[17:33:57] <jelly> yes
[17:34:27] <Khepra> oh you were already asking about badblocks(8) ... I misread the question.
[17:34:29] <WormFood> I can run badblocks, in read-only on a mounted filesystem...I just run it over sda the raw device

[17:35:31] <Khepra> if you can make a full backup, I'd recommend you stress this disk until the firmware shakes out and reallocates all the bad stuff
[17:35:35] <WormFood> Khepra, yeah. Of course, the drive should be replaced, but for the moment, I don't want to be forced into that at this moment....and it's a 1tb hdd, and it seems to be bad after 500 gig, so even if I repartition it, it's big enough to use (this is a spare computer, and nothing important on it)
[17:36:00] <Khepra> but... if you start seeing bad sectors, chances are it's only going to be growing.  my policy on servers and desktop is immediare replacement when I see 1 pending or realloc sector appear
[17:36:14] <Khepra> could be a bit too harsh policy... but... I haz important datas :)
[17:36:23] <jelly> you can run whatever you want, possibly even fsck.ext4 -c but the kernel won't read the updated metadata without an umount or reboot
[17:36:24] <WormFood> I did a "low level format" on it not that long ago (I'm talking about the drive's internal erase command, not really a "low level" format, but I like to think of it that way)
[17:36:57] <kjetilho> WormFood: STOP RIGHT NOW!  the more you are using your drive, the more data you will lose
[17:37:07] <jelly> what kjetilho said, too
[17:37:09] <WormFood> Khepra, I'm a professional computer tech. I've seen many, many, many hard drives go bad. I tell *everyone* to replace their drive, as soon as possible when they start getting bad sectors.
[17:37:29] <WormFood> kjetilho, I don't care about data loss. This is a spare computer. I've backed up what is important to me.
[17:37:38] <jelly> The shoemaker always wears the worst shoes
[17:37:55] <kjetilho> WormFood: ok then.
[17:38:02] <dvs> Carpenters always have the worst homes.
[17:38:18] <Khepra> I'd be curious to know if there's a tool that passes through all the sectors and reads and writes them back
[17:38:25] <Khepra> badblocks' -w is destructive write patterns
[17:38:31] <jelly> Khepra, man e2fsck
[17:38:35] <jelly> (yes)
[17:38:36] <WormFood> Khepra, badblocks, in a non-descructive read-write mode
[17:39:02] <Khepra> jelly: you mean -k ?
[17:39:25] <kjetilho> I used to love the refresh function in SunOS's format(1m).
[17:39:31] <jelly> Khepra, no, -c, read carefully
[17:39:51] <Khepra> jelly: ah, nice, -cc
[17:39:54] <Khepra> thanks
[17:40:42] <WormFood> badblocks -n     Use non-destructive read-write mode.
[17:40:46] <jelly> kjetilho, at some point people would just concede the point to Sun engineers and use only zfs until other fs gain data csums and resilvering
[17:41:04] <kjetilho> :-D
[17:41:10] <Khepra> WormFood: ah I see that too, thanks
[17:41:17] <jelly> but no, we still use fs that are known broken on today's hardware
[17:41:38] <kjetilho> jelly: we have btrfs - but I don't get the fuzzy feeling from it.  (partly due to atrocious CLI tools.)
[17:41:47] <Khepra> jelly: you make it sound as if that's a bad thing :))
[17:42:01] <jelly> prediction: btrfs will NEVER become stable and good enough
[17:42:43] <jelly> xfs or something like bcachefs may become the "more simple" safe default
[17:43:17] <Khepra> that'd be a joke, if bcachefs became more production ready than btrfs which had 10yr head start and whole corps backing it
[17:43:31] <jelly> perhaps it already is.
[17:43:48] <Khepra> it's not tho, missing a lot of comparative features
[17:44:18] <jelly> I mean as a replacement for default ext4
[17:44:23] <Khepra> but if RH pushes hard enough, xfs might beat it to the punch
[17:44:32] <Khepra> *line
[17:45:09] <kjetilho> Khepra: btrfs is the default in Fedoras and will be default in EL9 I think, so...
[17:45:16] <jelly> not as a competitor for zfs.  Just data checksums and proactive checks.
[17:45:22] <kjetilho> perhaps there is hope for improvement?

[19:54:15] <Khepra> *reinstall

[19:55:31] <xmb> i can only speak fully against using 'only one tree'
[19:56:25] <amacater_> And Debian has /boot/efi yes
[19:57:00] <Khepra> the two SSDs (zpool mirror) have previously booted in EFI mode, so ESP and EFI and everythig works.... just not on _this_ machine for some reason
[19:57:25] <Khepra> I don't even get to grub menu so it's not about initramfs or even linux. linux ain't loaded at this stage yet
[19:57:48] <amacater_> Chroot in with a Debian medium and reinstall grub-efi, maybe
[19:57:49] <Khepra> worst case, I nuke those ESPs and turn them to bios_grub legacy partitions for legacy boot.
[19:58:07] <amacater_> Khepra: No - don't go backwards ...
