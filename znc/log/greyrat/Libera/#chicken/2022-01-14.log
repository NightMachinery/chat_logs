[22:29:42] <johnjaye> it did.
[22:29:52] <johnjaye> apparently you have to setup the standard library. kind of a contradiction in terms
[22:30:12] <johnjaye> also you need to have UTF-8. a lot of UTF-8
[22:31:40] <Zipheir> Indeed so. :)
[22:31:56] <johnjaye> i'm not even sure if you were the one that recommended it to me
[22:32:00] <johnjaye> and too lazy to grep the logs
[22:32:09] <Zipheir> I mentioned PLFA.
[22:32:34] <Zipheir> Wadler says he picked Agda over Coq because there's no tactic language to learn.
[22:32:36] <johnjaye> ok. i hope next time you include the caveat that it's... a little janky to install.
[22:32:41] <johnjaye> yes
[22:33:03] <Zipheir> Hey, I didn't tell you to install it.  I just mentioned a book that uses it. :)
[22:33:24] <Zipheir> johnjaye: Have you read The Little Typer?
[22:33:45] <johnjaye> i barely got the reasoned schemer
[22:33:50] <johnjaye> did i get the wrong one lol
[22:34:25] <Zipheir> I love The Reasoned Schemer.  But I think TLP is my second favorite.
[22:34:37] <johnjaye> does it cover similar ideas as PLFA?
[22:34:40] <Zipheir> Yes.
[22:34:51] <johnjaye> hah. maybe i should have just gotten that instead
[22:34:56] <johnjaye> regardless i have it working now so
[22:35:16] <johnjaye> but quick rant to recap
[22:35:27] <Zipheir> The idea of passing around values of equality type like A≡B will be very familiar if you've gone through TLP.  But Wadler explains it well.
[22:35:38] <johnjaye> there's a builtin file named Nat.agda which I confused with Data/Nat which is the standard library. which you have to install. so i thought i had it when i didn't
[22:36:20] <johnjaye> then you have to create the files and manually type the path of where the standard library is. and finally i still couldn't get the test file to run, it turned out there was a missing space i couldn't see because i didn't show any unicode
[22:37:47] <Zipheir> OH, yes.
[22:37:59] <johnjaye> the latter which entailed experimenting to see if i had any fonts supporting math characters on freebsd. and i found exactly one such font out of the available 10.
[22:38:00] <Zipheir> Whitespace is the worst thing with Agda.
[22:39:38] <johnjaye> whitespace... *and* unicode
[22:39:50] <johnjaye> i mean kudos to someone with the guts to program in straight unicode
[22:40:09] <Zipheir> You mean non-ASCII Unicode, of course. :)
[22:40:20] <johnjaye> exactly.
[22:40:25] <johnjaye> since you know more than me how bad does it get
[22:40:57] <johnjaye> is it using like subset and products and that squiggly circle line they use in complex analysis for line integrals?
[22:42:25] <Zipheir> johnjaye: Take a look at https://plfa.github.io/DeBruijn/
[22:44:39] <johnjaye> you've got to be kidding me.
[22:44:48] <johnjaye> even this font i found on bsd to display utf-8 doesn't show all of those
[22:45:06] <Zipheir> You get the hang of it.  The whitespace issues are the only really frustrating thing, IME.
[22:45:31] <Zipheir> Yeah, you need a font like DejaVu Sans Mono with *good* Unicode coverage.
[22:45:48] <johnjaye> it's... a lambda with a strikethrough line? o_o
[22:45:51] <Zipheir> ⦂ is a minor problem, though.
[22:45:54] <Zipheir> Yup.
[22:46:29] <johnjaye> but i guess since it considers whitespace signficant it's a bit hard to type
[22:46:34] <johnjaye> and not in the good way like python
[22:46:46] <johnjaye> but more like the "you missed a space on line 312 now go find it"
[22:47:11] <Zipheir> Exactly.
[22:47:34] <Zipheir> One of the things I like least about Agda and Idris (both amazing languages otherwise) is the whitespace sensitivity.
[22:48:54] <johnjaye> i can see why. i ran smack into it first thing right after running hello world
[22:49:07] <Zipheir> But still, I recommend it!  It's amazing to see every mathematical result directly checked by Agda as you go.  The only issue I have with PLFA is that I think you're sort of "expected to see the point".  You can easily miss the forest for the trees.
[22:49:12] <johnjaye> if i didn't already have in mind the plfa book you mentioned i'd have not bothered with it
[22:49:34] <johnjaye> you think it's too terse?
[22:50:32] <Zipheir> Maybe.  I think it doesn't connect the small results with a "big picture" very well.
[22:51:30] <Zipheir> Like, OK, we can do a typed de Bruijn λ-calculus with type inference and it has various properties, but--what's the big point being made?
[22:52:00] <Zipheir> Maybe Wadler got railroaded by doing it strictly in Agda.
[22:53:15] <johnjaye> i think he said something like as you said coq required a separate tactics language
[22:53:18] <johnjaye> so that was the main motivation
[22:53:47] <johnjaye> pierce complained about having to spend a lot of time in coq minutae. and also something about students being exposed to deeper profound results sometimes that he couldn't really explain
[22:54:06] <Zipheir> That makes sense.
[22:54:24] <Zipheir> Agda is just functional programming, so there's definitely less to learn.
[22:55:06] <Zipheir> BTW, you might checkout out the ##dependent channel.  There tends to be a lot of PL-related discussion there, and it's vastly more active than #agda.
[22:55:52] <johnjaye> ok. i thought it was odd #agda existed. i thought it was if not made by wadler
[22:55:57] <johnjaye> at least that would be its main use
