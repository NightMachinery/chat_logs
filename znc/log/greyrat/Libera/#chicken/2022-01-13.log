[05:17:35] <johnjaye> Zipheir: do you have a lot of programming books. like physical copies
[05:17:48] <johnjaye> i just got my copy of Types and Programming Languages by Pierce
[05:22:00] <Zipheir> Sure, I have some physical copies.  Not of all the books I'd like to have copies of, but that's probably for the best (not enough shelves).
[05:22:40] <Zipheir> Pierce's books have been on my to-read list for a while.
[05:23:10] <Zipheir> I wonder how that one compares with plfa.github.io...
[05:24:21] <johnjaye> the thing i realized is i probably have too many physical books to carry with me in my car if i move for a new job which could happen in the next year
[05:24:30] <johnjaye> so... should i sell them, give them to the library, or mail them to you?
[05:24:37] <johnjaye> these are the options i thought of
[05:24:51] <johnjaye> i guess there's... ebay?
[05:26:24] <Zipheir> Hah, I appreciate the thought.  I guess I'd suggest donating them to a library, unless you need to get some money for them.
[05:27:12] <johnjaye> do libraries have like a system for trading books?
[05:27:13] <Zipheir> I've more or less made peace with not being able to move all of my books by myself in one trip.
[05:27:20] <johnjaye> i'd hate for the library i go to to just put it in a box
[05:27:59] <Zipheir> Maybe.  I don't know what the libraries are like in your area.
[05:28:39] <Zipheir> Here (New York) it can be hard to find public libraries that stock advanced CS books, so they might just sell or trash them... :/
[05:29:00] <johnjaye> yeah CS is kind of weird
[05:29:09] <johnjaye> a lot of it is online so as you say a lot of the resources are as well
[05:29:14] <johnjaye> but some are ONLY in print
[05:29:21] <johnjaye> like that tcp/ip thing
[05:29:24] <johnjaye> or OS books
[05:34:11] <Zipheir> Yes, older books especially.

[05:38:35] <Zipheir> Anything on FP or some other arcane topic by an academic publisher is just going to fall out of print at some point, and then it's either hoping someone's scanned it or spending $160 for a copy someone used as wall insulation for a decade.
[05:39:21] <Zipheir> The Algebra of Programming is a good example, which is ridiculously expensive for a short, 20-year-old book.
[05:39:44] <johnjaye> yeah that must be why you get those listings of some old book and it's $400

[11:24:11] <Bunny351> Zipheir: you want AoP? Send me your postal address
[11:28:26] <sjamaan> Selling textbooks second-hand is kind of pointless, I've found. Nobody seems to want to buy any books
[11:29:07] <sjamaan> It's just too niche; at the time you're looking to buy, there's no sellers and at the time you're selling, there are no buyers
[11:29:27] <sjamaan> If you want to get rid of them, putting them online for free works quite well
[11:29:45] <sjamaan> Actually, not for tech books
[11:30:07] <sjamaan> For novels that works well
[11:32:14] <Zipheir> Bunny351: I appreciate it, but I'm afraid shipping would cost a lot.
[11:32:27] <Bunny351> where do you live?
[11:32:48] <Zipheir> New York.
[11:33:09] <Zipheir> I'm rather surprised to hear you own that book :)
[11:38:35] <johnjaye> how many pages is Algebra of Programming?
[11:38:49] * Zipheir checks the PDF.
[11:39:12] <johnjaye> lol
[11:39:19] <Bunny351> Yeah, it's horrible :-)
[11:39:21] <johnjaye> portable document format
[11:39:26] <Zipheir> 295 including the index.
[11:39:42] <johnjaye> oh ok
[11:39:44] <Zipheir> Actually, this is a DjVu copy.  An underappreciated format, IMHO.
[11:40:15] <johnjaye> i was going to say, if the book is really small like < 80 pages may as well ust make a blog post talking about the ideas of the book instead of the book itself
[11:40:20] <johnjaye> more useful and easier to share
[11:40:27] <Bunny351> Zipheir: let me figure out the costs. If it's reasonable, you can have it
[11:40:31] <johnjaye> it's not even a book at that point more like a booklet or pamphlet
[11:40:46] <johnjaye> not like it's poetry either
[11:41:06] <Bunny351> anecdote: the company managing all IT for the Univeristy of Göttingen had a huge library of CS books, journals, etc.
[11:41:20] <Bunny351> I wnet there once, it was great.
[11:41:35] <sjamaan> What happened to vandusen?
[11:41:57] <Zipheir> Bunny351: Thanks.
[11:41:59] <Bunny351> now the move to new buildings and apparently they forgot to plan for a room for the library. from one day to another they decided to just throw everything away
[11:42:27] <Zipheir> sjamaan: Last I saw him was before a big netsplit at 18:30 UTC or so.
[11:42:27] <Bunny351> it's a sign of the deintellecutalisation of the whole field
[11:42:30] <sjamaan> mario-goulart: vandusen can't be started anymore
[11:42:38] <sjamaan> mario-goulart: Something with vandusen-excuses missing?
[11:42:44] <Bunny351> an absolute tragedy
[11:42:56] <Bunny351> (the library, not vandusen)
[11:43:03] <sjamaan> heh
[11:43:04] <johnjaye> Bunny351: also from what I investigated digital preservation isn't really a thing
[11:43:15] <Bunny351> no, people just don't care!
[11:43:20] <johnjaye> all the things - bluray, hard disk, even tape drive has a smaller lifetime than just paper
[11:43:34] <johnjaye> at least acid-free paper iirc
[11:44:08] <Bunny351> and nobody seems to have a clue of just how much research has ben done, and how old it often is
[11:44:13] <Bunny351> been
[11:44:32] <johnjaye> it's not totally the fault of deintellectualization i guess
[11:44:32] <sjamaan> johnjaye: There's archive.org, they are attempting to at least preserve some goods digitally, even music I think
[11:45:02] <johnjaye> i think if your book on complexity or NP problems is 20 years old and uses pascal for the examples it needs an updated version
[11:45:10] <Bunny351> johnjaye: it is part of it, sure.
[11:45:23] <Bunny351> but whether a book uses pascal or MIX, doesn't matter
[11:45:35] <johnjaye> i think an other angle is there's no clear chain of linkage sometimes
[11:45:52] <johnjaye> like with friedman you could argue little schemer -> seasoned schemer -> reasoned schemer is a sensible progression
[11:45:54] <sjamaan> Bunny351: Funny, because Knuth seems to think MIX is so outdated he wants to replace it with MMIX
[11:46:08] <johnjaye> but for a lot of books/papers it's not really clear what the prereqs are if any
[11:46:32] <Bunny351> why should the language matter, if you give akgorithms?
[11:46:39] <sjamaan> It doesn't
[11:46:48] <Bunny351> pseudo code works fine, too
[11:47:07] <johnjaye> then someone decided to make executable pseudocode and call it python
[11:47:17] <sjamaan> But I suppose it's easier to understand an algorithm if the language it's expressed in is at least somewhat familiar
[11:47:31] <Bunny351> come one, pascal is trivial
[11:47:44] <sjamaan> yeah Pascal is great even, for that purpose
[11:48:02] <sjamaan> I was more thinking of MIX/MMIX
[11:48:08] <Bunny351> math or chemistry students tackle much more obscure and complex notations
[11:48:18] <johnjaye> maybe it's fashion
[11:48:27] <johnjaye> like how OO is big in one decade. then generics or threads in another
[11:48:40] <johnjaye> the same underlying ideas need to be rephrased for the current zeitgiest

[12:48:28] <sjamaan> But you just fixed it!
[12:49:03] <mario-goulart> It's a "fix".  I merely hacked it to bring vandusen back.  It's still on C4.
[12:49:43] <sjamaan> It shouldn't be difficult to port, but we just need someone to put in the effort
[12:51:26] <mario-goulart> Ultimately everything always boils down to "someone to put in the effort". :-)
[12:52:20] <mario-goulart> I see that sandbox has been ported to C5.  I think that was one of the blockers for vandusen.  Maybe it is really not difficult to port it now.

[16:16:15] <siiky> doh! vandusen went offline... Bunny351: (it's a bit out of context now, but you can find it easily in the log if you scroll up enough :)   isn't that what `chicken-status -list` and `chicken-install -from-list` (or `-override`, not sure) are for? (except they're not egg specific/local)
[16:20:47] <siiky> sjamaan: RE your post about DSLs and preventing injections: is there anything we can do when the only interface is textual? (other than laboriously mirroring the target language in the DSL)  a few months ago I found some low-key command injection vulnerabilities in various Gnuplot wrappers, and I see that there's one for CHICKEN too, so I was wondering (just out of curiosity) if there's anything we can do 
[16:20:53] <siiky> to improve such an interface
[16:21:13] <siiky> s/post/posts/
[16:31:26] <sjamaan> siiky: I think you'd have to model all the commands you're interested in as s-expressions
[16:43:00] <siiky> sjamaan: right, I think so too...
[16:51:15] *** Joins: ublx (~ublx@user/ublx)
[16:59:15] <wasamasa> you need to be very clear what's accepted and what isn't
[16:59:33] <wasamasa> quoting may suffice for simplicistic protocols, HTML is an example for how not to do it
[17:01:24] <wasamasa> I've most recently went through the emacsclient one
[17:09:30] <wasamasa> siiky: do you have any injection examples?
[17:09:41] <siiky> yeah, but the problem is that implementers of such interfaces may not necessarily know the protocol/target language in depth... let's I want to implement an interface for Gnuplot; I know some of the commands, and some of the valid argument combinations, but I certainly don't know all of them! now, I may still be able to build a library that is useful to *me*, but if happens that I'm not the "common case", 
[17:09:47] <siiky> I'll be its sole user and the library will die out; meanwhile, a less secure implementation, that just lets the users do w.e. the f*ck they want, will be more popular, exactly because users can do w.e. the f*ck they want, even if that means they're vulnerable
[17:10:08] <siiky> I'll have to search... give me a few secs
[17:14:07] <wasamasa> I've looked at gnuplot-pipe and it seems to fall into the arbitrary command camp
[17:16:25] <siiky> the ones I found were like that too; I haven't looked at gnuplot-pipe
[17:16:39] <siiky> they were similar to these two: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-65xx-c85x-wg76 & https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfwc-xjfp-44jg

[17:22:59] <sjamaan> siiky: The same problem I had with SQL basically; it's too much of an open-ended moving target to make a good DSL for
[17:27:48] <wasamasa> sigh, of course it supports backquotes, too
[17:28:33] <wasamasa> like "`id`"
[17:32:30] <siiky> sjamaan: well, I just thought that maybe some restrictions are OK for a DSL even if they don't exist in the target language, because you're using a programming language after all... e.g., in Gnuplot, string concatenation is a single dot (`.`); but you probably don't need that when generating a script to pass on to the Gnuplot program, you can just use `string-append` or w.e.
[17:32:48] <siiky> maybe that's obvious, but it wasn't to me haha
[17:33:42] <siiky> wasamasa: hahahaha holy shit
[17:33:59] <siiky> that's too good

[17:35:13] <wasamasa> it's the only way to be sure
