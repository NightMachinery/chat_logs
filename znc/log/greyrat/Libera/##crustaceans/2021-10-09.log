[00:18:48] <manicennui> Are they actually killing it, or just not interested?
[00:19:21] <manicennui> I don't know anyone my age who is interested either.
[00:19:49] <manicennui> I feel like more than half of that hobby is really about having an excuse to work on electronics, which I get.

[00:24:04] <manicennui> Who is he?
[00:24:13] <gerikson> just someoen I met on IRC ages ago
[00:24:14] <manicennui> hah
[00:24:38] * manicennui doesn't actually suffer from impostor syndrome.
[00:24:48] <manicennui> I might have for a small amount of time at one point.
[00:25:25] <manicennui> I usually just worry that people are going to figure out what a lazy ass I am.
[00:25:30] <manicennui> And how little work I actually do.
[00:25:39] <gwozniak> I get a  bit of it sometimes, but rarely does it prevent me from doing stuff
[00:26:00] <gwozniak> I have lots of stuff I want to work on, but it's time that stop me
[00:26:12] <manicennui> Yeah, I have the time.
[00:26:15] <manicennui> I'm just really lazy.
[00:26:21] <manicennui> Or unmotivated.

[00:50:06] <indigo> Life hack: recipe websites outside the US are a lot less shitty (ads, popovers, etc)
[00:51:24] <gerikson> but what about your cups and ounces
[00:51:53] <indigo> Fuck it, my scale and measures can go metric too
[00:52:31] <gerikson> what?! how... COMMUNIST
[00:57:10] <indigo> I was born in the Soviet Union so I guess it makes sense
[01:00:59] <dimadima> indigo: what do you do about stakan?
[01:01:12] <dimadima> (if ever doing russian stuff()
[01:01:52] <indigo> I break them
[01:02:11] <dimadima> (for all the non-commies, a "stakan" is literally "glass" in russian and is their equivalent of cup conceptually but i've never quite udnerstood what the exact volume is supposed to be)
[01:02:15] <dimadima> heh
[01:02:18] <dimadima> that works
[01:04:02] <dimadima> some day i will search what the internet says
[01:05:21] <dimadima> my scale goes metric/imperial BUT it fucking times out
[01:05:29] <dimadima> most worthless scale in the world. makes me so anxious
[01:06:14] <kline> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[01:06:20] <kline> this fucking box
[01:06:22] <dimadima> can't use it for any operation that's not reversible
[01:06:39] <dimadima> what box
[01:07:00] <kline> my weekend was supposed to start at 1300, but im the on call today and someone crashed their car so i wasnt able to give my final box to the courier when they arrived at one
[01:07:27] <kline> courier company promised a re-show at 1800-1900 for their second, emergency pickup but didnt show
[01:07:52] <kline> 2204 they arrived, i was dozing in the on-call room, front gate rang me to said theyd arrived
[01:08:23] <kline> chucked everything in the car, arrived at the front gate at 2208 only to see the courier driving out the front gate
[01:09:24] <kline> so im stuck holding this one massive medical material box that can fit like 100 COVID PCR tests
[01:09:30] <kline> with exactly 1 tiny test in it
[01:10:09] <dimadima> amazon would ship it
[01:10:11] <kline> and im like 9h late to get away for my weekend because the courier arrived, waited about 3 mins and they fucked off before i got to the campus gate
[01:10:33] <dimadima> i'm sorry that sucks
[01:10:51] <indigo> Damn dude, sorry to hear
[01:11:04] <kline> ive just a 6h drive ahead of me
[01:11:05] <dimadima> can you at least leave now
[01:11:24] <kline> i was supposed to be back in scotland the next country over to meet the gf for dinner
[01:11:41] <kline> and now its going to be like midnight before i can even leave and ill arrive as shes waking up at like 7am
[01:11:44] <dimadima> my wife wants to go to scotland so bad
[01:11:49] <dimadima> as do i, really
[01:11:59] <dimadima> man
[01:11:59] <kline> let me know if you ever make it
[01:12:06] <dimadima> we will god help us
[01:12:46] <dimadima> scotland, though
[01:13:09] <dimadima> i guess that's boring to you
[01:13:24] <dimadima> that's like if i had to drive to up-state new york at mid-night
[01:13:42] <kline> it would be very pretty if it werent pitch black
[01:13:46] <dimadima> yeah
[01:14:30] <dimadima> train not an option?
[01:14:53] <kline> its not really about that, im happy to drive
[01:15:03] <kline> but im literally stuck here until i get rid of this box
[01:15:08] <dimadima> i was thinking of train you could sleep
[01:15:12] <dimadima> if*
[01:15:39] <kline> i dont mind if i have to drive up midnight-6am and then nap 6-10 and just call it a lie in
[01:16:02] <kline> but i cant leave until i get this box away and ive been trying since 1pm and people are just kissing it off
[01:16:13] <dimadima> yeah
[01:16:16] <dimadima> sucks
[01:17:01] <dimadima> that's frustrating
[01:17:07] <dimadima> and the pizza
[01:17:30] <kline> i got a refund and a new pizza in the end
[01:17:42] <dimadima> at least that came through
[01:17:46] <kline> why couldnt this have been yesterday though
[01:18:01] <kline> thought id be a nice manager and sent all my guys away for their weekend at 11am
[01:18:18] <kline> literally 12h later im still stuck at work
[01:18:24] <dimadima> heh
[01:18:25] <imode> fuck that's infuriating.
[01:18:44] <kline> the worst thing is the lab i need to drop this box off at is basically on the way to scotland
[01:18:59] <kline> i could just drop it off as i go by but i have no idea how i would actually do so
[01:19:23] <indigo> Does the lab have a phone number
[01:20:00] <indigo> Although it seems like they'll be closed by the time you get there
[01:20:15] <kline> no, all i have are a bunch of labels for internal mail (lab name, box serial, etc)
[01:20:48] <kline> i know based on the lab name that its on an industrial estate in a city between here and home but no details on what id have to do when i arrive
[01:21:07] <kline> indigo, i mean, presumably if the courier arrives at 2200 its open "late"
[01:21:26] <indigo> Right
[01:21:44] <indigo> What happens if you were to just "lose" the box
[01:21:53] <deadk> he'll be shot at dawn
[01:22:03] <indigo> Ahh, bummer
[01:24:15] <kline> indigo, if i lose the box then the very nice person who is supposed to be deploying overseas cannot get his flight
[01:24:27] <kline> on sunday morning
[01:25:05] <indigo> Aw man... that really blows
[01:25:13] <indigo> 72 hours before the flight COVID test eh
[01:25:18] <kline> yeah
[01:26:56] <kline> deadk, https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/315277951597936640/896153714958696468/9c645160-1108-43a1-846a-42a389c20ba5.png
[01:30:02] <deadk> someone's angry
[01:43:05] <imode> fuck that person.
[01:46:53] <indigo> Someone doesn't like the results of their analysis ;)
[01:51:07] <manicennui> I'm guessing that some data set included women or something and that triggered him.
[01:53:25] <manicennui> "WASHINGTON — The White House on Friday formally blocked an attempt by former President Donald Trump to withhold documents from Congress related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, setting up a legal showdown between the current and former presidents over executive privilege."
[01:53:40] <manicennui> How can one even defend wanting to withhold documents from Congress?
[01:59:49] * dimadima edits yarn.lock by hand :<
[02:03:48] <manicennui> You sick fuck.
[02:06:01] <dimadima> i think something is missing in my understanding of these lockfiles
[02:07:42] <manicennui> Generally you must run some command after updating the main file.
[02:07:49] <dimadima> yeah
[02:07:57] <dimadima> i mean more conceptual than that

[02:18:36] <indigo> edm: Yeah, when Pierce Brosnan started to sing...
[02:19:26] <edm> But when esa started to talk
[02:19:50] <edm> Some of them are just about starting to incorporate jenkins
[02:20:05] <edm> Github ci is ‘not maturated’
[02:20:51] <imode> edm: does that dial go up to 11.
[02:23:39] <indigo> Oof, Jenkins
[02:27:37] <kline> right
[02:27:55] <kline> i called the courier company direct after looking them up online rather than going through the chain of command
[02:29:08] <kline> gave them a good waaaa and complained about how its not acceptable to have me up from 0600 to 2330 for them to kiss off a collection and theyve found a driver to come before 1am
[02:30:03] <indigo> Good
[02:30:37] <indigo> Is this DHL
[02:31:26] <kline> it could be, its a courier abstraction layer who contract with all the different actual man-in-van companies so the military dont have to maintain a dozen different contracts
[02:32:25] <indigo> Oh I didn't know you were in the military
[02:32:48] <indigo> I used to work in defense contracting... totally get the bureaucracy
[02:36:56] <kline> 90% of my life right now is dealing with issues that are easy solves just no one knows who to ask about it
[02:37:12] <kline> so you're left holding this responsibility that you cant do anything with but likewise cant offload anywhere

[03:15:39] <manicennui> We keep losing people.
[03:15:44] <manicennui> Another person gave notice today.
[03:16:07] <indigo> Oh shit! Where are they going?
[03:20:53] <manicennui> Don't know in most cases.
[03:21:02] <manicennui> I know a few left because we weren't clear about our remote work policy.
[03:21:21] <manicennui> It's possible that the recent ones left because they started looking before the company gave in.
[03:24:32] <manicennui> My employer also hasn't kept up with the massive jumps in software engineer salaries.
[03:24:38] <manicennui> So it isn't hard to get more money right now.
[03:24:51] <manicennui> My boss said they are aware and looking into it.
[03:24:55] <manicennui> But they are often slow to act.
[03:25:10] <manicennui> I'm sure we changed our remote policy because enough people left for remote positions.

[04:34:42] <buttsbot> xmake v2.5.8 is released, Support Pascal Swig program and Lua53 runtime | Lobsters
[04:35:11] <imode> dimadima: that's right! six commands at its base, uses only bits.
[04:35:30] <imode> if you want anything like byte arithmetic, you gotta build it.
[04:37:14] <imode> I kinda cornered myself into a corner because I don't actually have an idea to build an efficient bitwise deque.
[04:37:37] <imode> well I have rough sketches, but a bitwise deque is weird.
[04:40:57] <dimadima> interesting
[04:41:40] <dimadima> so there's a data structure (a queue) of some size?
[04:42:11] <dimadima> it starts empty, and then you perform operations on it?
[04:47:57] <companion_cube> imode: the answer is CHR(BF)
[04:50:18] <dimadima> whether or not ruki is spamming, people who write things like "Stop spamming." are, in my opinion, assdholes
[04:50:32] <dimadima> i mean, he's posting once a month
[04:50:41] <dimadima> he/she/they
[04:50:56] <companion_cube> stop spamming about spam, dimadima
[04:51:15] <dimadima> could you please prefix that with "pleasE"
[04:51:26] <dimadima> that really makes all the difference
[04:53:30] <dimadima> HN calls such posts "follow-up posts" and marks them as dupes
[04:53:37] <dimadima> dang tells ppl, politely, to stop
[04:53:48] <companion_cube> dimadima: I want to talk to your manager
[04:54:05] <dimadima> companion_cube: one minute while i connect you
[04:54:18] * dimadima puts phone down and smokes cigarette
[04:54:45] * companion_cube throws cigarette on the floor and stomps on it
[04:55:00] <dimadima> hey you're not allowed to reach through the phone
[04:55:31] <dimadima> https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=dang%20follow-up%20post&sort=byPopularity&type=comment
[04:55:31] <buttsbot> Just a moment...
[04:56:53] <kronk> dimadima: yeah, the queue starts out empty of bits, and then you enqueue bits to it.
[04:58:15] <kronk> it's different than BF in that you have no static memory size.
[05:06:01] <dimadima> kronk: how do you get a "result"?
[05:06:20] <dimadima> sorry if these are lame questions feel free to link to something or just ignore them :)
[05:18:32] <imode> oh no no, not lame at all.
[05:18:36] <imode> sorry, I went to walk to the sunset.
[05:18:38] <imode> my bad.
[05:19:03] <imode> back now. and, with these instructions... there is no "result". the 'result' is whatever's left in the queue when the program terminates.
[05:19:25] <imode> the entire program state is.. wherever you are in the program (instruction pointer), and the deque contents.
[05:19:42] <imode> you _can_ add I/O devices similar to retroforth.
[05:20:33] <imode> I'm still going over an I/O model. I have an optimizing compiler that can do basic passes like I've shown. maybe I'll turn `><` into "invoke I/O", or add input and output instructions similar to brainfuck.
[05:26:25] <dimadima> imode: sounds nice. what's walking "to" the sunset?
[05:26:49] <dimadima> is that a thing?
[05:27:05] <imode> yeah! going to a place that you can watch the sunset at.
[05:27:07] <dimadima> ah cool so when it terminates, it prints the queue or something lik ethat
[05:27:40] <imode> right now it does, but a regular compiled program... does nothing. :D
[05:27:50] <imode> unless you use I/O.
[05:27:55] <dimadima> nice :)
[05:28:51] <dimadima> pretty cool!
[05:29:16] <dimadima> what are you programming this language in?
[05:29:44] <imode> right now I just have a python interpreter and "to-C" compiler.
[05:30:49] <imode> but, I mean.
[05:31:09] <imode> in the future, it should just be written in "the language" with several backends.
[05:31:36] <imode> https://hastebin.com/fuzozijagu.py
[05:31:36] <buttsbot> hastebin
[05:31:39] <imode> here's the compiler.
[05:31:53] <imode> I don't really wanna call it a compiler but..
[05:35:32] <dimadima> why'd you pick this to work on? is there aspect in particular you are exploring?
[05:35:38] <dimadima> some aspect*
[05:36:12] <imode> I think it's fascinating to push the limits of what people consider minimally viable in terms of programming environments.
[05:36:37] <companion_cube> as in, scala? how non minimal you can make it? :p
[05:37:23] <imode> considering it's six instructions.. pretty minimal, unless you start combining instructions.
[05:37:27] <imode> I wanted to get it down to 4.
[05:37:39] <companion_cube> all you need is NAND ♩♪
[05:37:55] <imode> and recursion.
[05:39:41] <dimadima> so somewhere between NAND and this language you've got writing binary to the CPU w/o assembly?
[05:40:28] <imode> depends on the CPU! a lot of CPUs assume stuff like register widths, memory mappings, etc.
[05:40:44] <imode> it's more like a turing machine or a deqeue atomaton.

[05:46:01] <dimadima> ah yes that's what i meant but i could quite get to "turing machine"
[05:46:16] <dimadima> super cool
[05:46:27] <companion_cube> to think imode could have picked SKI instead :p
[05:46:36] <imode> I did that already.
[05:46:46] <imode> wayyyyyyyyy too unwieldy.
[05:46:49] <companion_cube> :D
[05:46:55] <companion_cube> a bit of unlambda perhaps?
[05:47:23] <imode> still pretty unwieldy. I had a concatenative combinator base of like... five or six combinators.
[05:47:37] <imode> reason being that was the least uncomfortable to actually write code in.
[05:47:50] <companion_cube> yeah I agree
[05:47:58] <companion_cube> actual lambdas are better
[05:48:03] <companion_cube> combinators are just… cute
[05:48:04] <imode> there was no way to form quotations outside of composing stuff together.
[05:48:15] <imode> so you couldn't do [ foo bar baz ] apply
[05:48:23] <imode> you had to do foo bar compose ! baz compose ! apply !
[05:48:37] <imode> ! actually "invokes" or "calls" the combinator.
[05:48:44] <companion_cube> hum
[05:49:01] <imode> you could trivially form numbers and such out of that. I got very very far.
[05:50:11] <imode> https://hastebin.com/raw/ezeduyicir
[05:50:28] <imode> about as far as a brainfuck DSL.
[05:50:42] <imode> and a lot of custom syntax.
[05:51:26] <companion_cube> ah cause of course you use a postfix notation :)
[05:51:37] <imode> well yeah. it's all concatenative lmao.
[05:57:36] <companion_cube> (that said, combinators are an ok target for logical reasoning)

[07:03:12] <indigo> Oof, that's going to be fun when folks upgrade

[19:24:35] <ngoldbaum> IQ is socially constructed
[19:24:54] <ngoldbaum> people believe individual IQ scores are meaningful sad but true
[19:25:33] <imode> in fact I'd argue if you have 10x programmers at your workplace, and these mythical programmers exist, then the ratio between those mythical programmers and us "regular folk" favors not hiring them due to the buisness risks of maintaining products for paying customers.
[19:26:09] <imode> and we should argue that they are pariahs because they do things the rest of us can't maintain. it should be the inverse relationship.
[19:26:50] <imode> in short fuck that thread.
[19:31:36] * dcz definitely has 10x folks, but they are not writing 10x code but helping solve 10x problems
[19:32:05] <bkero> the jokes write themselves
[19:32:36] <imode> dcz: that's different. that's effort, not mythical intellect.
[19:33:12] <imode> grinding through a ticket queue is a different thing than claiming you've built the programmer's equivalent of a dyson sphere and everybody else is an idiot.

[19:34:42] <imode> yeah.
[19:35:23] <ngoldbaum> “solving 10x problems”
[19:35:25] <ngoldbaum> what even
[19:35:59] <imode> is "10x problems" taken to be a problem class or are they just solving 10 times more problems than the others.
[19:36:10] <dcz> 10x is quite literally 10 times
[19:36:14] <imode> lol.
[19:36:24] <imode> they must love their jobs, then.
[19:36:25] <bkero> they do things 10 times
[19:36:36] <bkero> you should ask why they havent automated them yet
[19:36:38] <imode> or have very low friction in the workplace.
[19:36:43] <bkero> with regression tests and cicd
[19:36:44] <dcz> I'm not sure you folks are interested in having a discussion here
[19:36:54] <imode> genuinely interested in what you mean.
[19:37:21] <dcz> yeah, loving the job is visible
[19:37:28] <imode> "10 times" more problems means that these problems are roughly uniform.
[19:37:33] <imode> so, like, what are they.
[19:38:09] <dcz> problems related to the areas they have experience in, and that includes knowing how to communicate the right ideas to the right people
[19:38:29] <imode> in that case every SDE III is a 10x dev.
[19:38:39] <dcz> I don't know that jargon
[19:38:42] <imode> rather, every subject matter expert is as well (if they're a dev).
[19:38:50] <imode> basically every senior engineer.
[19:39:00] <dcz> that sounds plausible
[19:39:09] <imode> someone familiar with their domain, entrenched into the codebases they touch every day.
[19:39:16] <imode> in that case I know a 10x.
[19:40:20] <imode> communicating ideas and distilling domain knowledge is kind of the point of a senior dev. you're not going to be used for a lot of grunt work, but you'll need to explain a lot of the solutions to higher management.
[19:40:31] <imode> if that's 10x then it's a lot less mythical and a lot more practical.
[19:40:47] <dcz> I like practical solutions
[19:41:14] <ngoldbaum> my experience with wunderkind programmers is that they churn out tons of unmaintainable buggy code who someone else is left to fix later after they parlay the buggy codebase into bigger and better things
[19:41:38] <imode> ngoldbaum: we call that parlay process "promotion driven development".
[19:45:11] <riv> isn't this universal?
[19:45:19] <riv> don't all programmers make buggy unmaintainable code

[20:51:29] <dimadima> should have done compsci in college but i didn't for some reason :
[20:51:31] <dimadima> :(
[20:51:40] <imode> compsci in college is uh.. let's called it a mixed bag.
[20:51:44] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: it is
[20:51:52] <imode> you would've wasted your money, more than likely.
[20:51:54] <dimadima> imode: yeah all the compsci kids freaked me out
[20:52:07] <dimadima> i picked my major based on how much the people in it seemed.... uh.... off?
[20:52:17] <dimadima> like i started w/ physics and that was a shitshow in terms of humanity
[20:52:31] <ngoldbaum> if your goal is to learn how to be a good professional programmer there’s a lot of content you learn in a cs degree that actively goes against that goal
[20:52:42] <imode> it'^
[20:52:50] <dimadima> ended up doing chem cause it was really intersting still, you could do physics/math and the ppl/profs were chill
[20:53:02] <ngoldbaum> it teaches you how to write code that no one reads but passes automated tests handed down from on high
[20:53:05] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: naa i'm more into math and shit
[20:53:19] <imode> you won't learn it in a computer science course. :\
[20:53:27] <dimadima> i did some of a math degree but i didn't have time to actualyl finish it
[20:53:33] <imode> which is fucking unfortunate, because schools have conflated CS with trade programming.
[20:53:36] <ngoldbaum> you will learn about data structures though
[20:53:41] <dimadima> time/intelligence to do it with chem and also lots of chilling
[20:53:55] <dimadima> that's cool i'd love to know about those
[20:54:00] <dimadima> but i'm not sure i ever will
[20:54:02] <imode> college IMO is a waste of money.
[20:54:09] <ngoldbaum> the main benefit of getting a CS degree is to pass interview screens that are basically checking if you have a CS degree
[20:54:15] <dimadima> it definitely not worth what it's come to cost
[20:54:33] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: yes in terms of getting jobs, that does seem to be the main benefit
[20:54:42] <dimadima> but man i love computers and shit
[20:54:54] <dimadima> "and shit", sorry
[20:54:54] <imode> I don't have a degree, but I've taught CS and networking at community college and university.
[20:55:04] <dimadima> that's awesome
[20:55:18] <dimadima> college has become a monster shitshow
[20:55:36] <dimadima> i went to a state school for a year and my entire floor did little bug drink and play xbox
[20:55:39] <dimadima> but*
[20:55:57] <imode> yeah, that's the unfortunate part of college. people see it as an excuse to form communities and party.
[20:55:58] <dimadima> it was pretty disheartening
[20:56:10] <imode> because everybody is encouraged to go to college at the time of their life when they need to be exploring themselves and the world.
[20:56:25] <Geekingfrog> I think it's also becoming known to be a good career choice: good salary, not terribly hard job and so on. So lots more ppl are coming into the field.
[20:56:35] <dimadima> when i went to school there was a 45 yo guy who had been a cabby in new york for 20 years doing a physics degree
[20:56:38] <imode> yup, and you have to optimize for the most people.
[20:56:38] <dimadima> he did complete it in fact
[20:56:44] <imode> which is why it's trade programming instead of actual CS..
[20:56:44] <dimadima> and ended up working in physics somewhere
[20:56:59] <imode> dimadima: that's the way to do it.
[20:57:07] <dimadima> imode: it is and it isn't though, right?
[20:57:26] <dimadima> you def shuldn't go to college and fuck around, accrue tons of debt and then drop out
[20:57:39] <imode> yeah. but if you _know_ what you want to do, you can go do it.
[20:57:50] <dimadima> if you're that type, yes
[20:57:57] <imode> when you're young you just lack planning, because you're fuckin 18 on average and don't know what you want to do
[20:58:02] <dimadima> seems like there aren't many actual self-starting ppl out there. life really breaks most people
[20:58:10] <dimadima> life/primary school
[20:58:10] <imode> I didn't know what the heck I wanted to do at 18. but I liked programming, computers.
[20:58:32] <dimadima> how was your high school experience
[20:59:38] <imode> modestly unfavorable.
[20:59:45] <dimadima> heh yeah
[20:59:46] <imode> I did a lot of self-study.
[20:59:55] <imode> and flunked out a lot of classes I didn't care for.

[21:00:21] <dimadima> same. i was lucky i went to a private school so got to fuck around and skip lots of school such that in a public school i would have probably been held back or expelled
[21:00:46] <dimadima> yeah i failed some classes i high school by not attending them
[21:01:20] <dimadima> cool they let you teach w/o a degree!
[21:02:01] <imode> it was a lot of fun. while I was attending community college I spent the first semester just getting to know people (I'm a severe introvert, so that was new), and I spent the second semester teaching the courses I was paying to take.

[21:02:35] <imode> those were some lovely days. wake up for class, check on the "experiments" the students are doing with the cadaver PCs that the IT students experiment on.
[21:02:55] <imode> go over the agenda for the day, get really fired up about the stuff you lecture about...
[21:03:08] <indigo> Cool! I guess it’s kinda “serverless” irssi then
[21:03:29] <imode> capping the day off with a 9 PM class for displaced mill workers who wanted to become PC technicians, and who didn't understand how computers work... at all.
[21:03:53] <imode> most of them knew some rudimentary form of assembly by the end, and could actually get jobs. still get mail from people who are 3-4 years into their career now.
[21:05:17] <imode> I went to the University of Maine after that and did roughly the same thing, then went to a defense contractor for the money.
[21:05:20] <indigo> dimadima: chem eh? I did ChemE :)
[21:05:39] <indigo> Dropped out of grad school and never looked back
[21:06:00] <imode> the switch works!
[21:06:19] <imode> haven't used this friggin' thing in 3 years.
[21:14:55] <dimadima> indigo: haha yeah like serverless irssi except you need  a k8s cluster, which i had. not sure how prudent it is running irssi on my production (and only) cluster but eh i looked at the image and it's not running root.

[21:15:50] <dimadima> imode: where were these displaced mill workers? maine? i saw a lot of brownbelt type stuff the one time i went to maine
[21:16:29] <dimadima> i went to a kmart in, i think, waterville and there was a ton of shutdown industry there. industry that looked it had not been shutdown that long even
[21:17:04] <imode> dimadima: yeah, a local mill went belly-up and laid off a bunch of folk.
[21:17:17] <dimadima> indigo: yeah i worked in a lab and had some older friends who went to grad school and fortuntately realized by 4th year that it was not for me
[21:17:31] <dimadima> really glad i learned chemistry though
[21:17:43] <imode> oh fuck apparently it _exploded_ last year.
[21:17:45] <imode> that's awesome.

[21:19:17] <dimadima> heh. the paper mill where i grew up got turned into a wegman's anchored outdoor mall kind of thing

[21:20:23] <dimadima> sometimes the economy really feels like that husker du song "how to skin a cat"
[21:20:32] <imode> lmao.
[21:21:57] <dimadima> So we will have four rats to feed each day to each cat / Now what shall we feed the rats? / We will feed the rats the carcasses of the cats / After they have been skinned / Now get this, we feed the rats to the cats / And the cats to the rats and get the cat skins for nothing
[21:22:14] <dimadima> lol
[21:22:20] <dimadima> never gets old
[21:22:35] <imode> sounds like factory farming.
[21:23:18] <dimadima> so this mill only closed in 2014?
[21:23:37] <imode> yeah.
[21:23:44] <imode> late 2014.
[21:24:43] <dimadima> "Our assessment indicates that it is impossible for the mill to achieve profitability in today's marketplace,"
[21:25:10] <dimadima> "Verso is committed to helping the Bucksport mill employees who will be affected by the closure." heh
[21:26:23] <imode> yeah that didn't happen.
[21:26:36] <dimadima> my family came to the united states in 1990 and its funny how a lot of the things that didn't make sense to us for a long time, but that we came to kind of accept, turned out to be worthy of the initial suspicion
[21:26:37] <imode> I had a former high school teacher of mine affected by that.
[21:26:57] <dimadima> did they work at the mill?
[21:27:05] <imode> yup.
[21:27:11] <imode> they were a physics teacher.
[21:27:13] <imode> chem as well.
[21:27:13] <dimadima> and the high school?
[21:27:24] <dimadima> or they left hs and went to the mill?
[21:27:31] <imode> left HS and went to the mill after my first year.
[21:27:36] <dimadima> wow interesting
[21:27:58] <imode> industry is more profitable than education.
[21:28:36] <dimadima> secondary education in the USSR was all career oriented, and when my family came here none of the adults understood how people here studied exotic humanities and were supposed to make money
[21:28:57] <imode> if it smells like BS it probably is.
[21:28:59] <dimadima> or, like, how the US was supposed to continue functioning economically if all the industry was moving away
[21:29:33] <dimadima> yeah turns it makes sense to listen to your instincts, at least to some degree
[21:30:13] <dimadima> it's nice college wasn't totally career oriented. it's kind of sad that it's presented like that to kids
[21:30:30] <dimadima> but having no regard for career stuff and also getting ppl to drop 50k/yr on that is too much
[21:30:40] <imode> +1 to all of that.
[21:32:01] <dimadima> okay will try to focus and work for the rest of my kid's nap :) cheers
[21:32:29] <imode> take easy!

[22:53:52] <manicennui> Apparently it doesn't like to run hot while not having a working CPU fan.
[22:54:09] <manicennui> Silly CPU
[22:54:23] <dimadima> how are the decibels
[23:00:39] <manicennui> Low
[23:00:50] <manicennui> Was obviously 0 when it wasn't working
[23:01:21] <manicennui> About 6 months ago it started making weird noises and I knew it was failing, so I bought a new fan
[23:01:36] <manicennui> Just never got around to installing it, but my machine has been freezing while playing Overwatch lately.
[23:01:48] <manicennui> Opened it up today and it wasn't running at all.
[23:10:15] <manicennui> Has to use my leatherman to get the clips off the old fan.
[23:10:35] <manicennui> There were little pads between the fan and the heatsink, and they were covering the screws.
[23:11:03] <manicennui> Don't have any new pads to put on it, but it seems secure enough. Hopefully it won't start rattling.
