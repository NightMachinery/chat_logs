[00:00:10] <opalvaults> Very interesting, I suppose I get an idea that maintainers are put on a pedastal, and you see a lot of the good, and bad from both sides of the spectrum. It can be thankless, but also incredibly rewarding. It's easy to miss the forest for the trees, and keep in mind that most every piece of FLOSS software is a very decentralized and maintanance heavy vs. centralized and focused on LOC.

[00:01:07] <jeroentesttest[m> i don't get the project vs product
[00:01:49] <tgbugs> project is the process of creating the product (usually)
[00:01:55] <lounge-544> jeroentesttest[m : because "project" has been redefined over time to mean the product (such as the codebase), together with the project as in the endeavor to create/develop it
[00:02:07] <TDT> Project is a greater scope than product, in my view.  A project is not only the code, but the relationships with others who interact with it.  The product can be the same, but doesn't usually include the support aspect since it's "free".  
[00:02:08] <paraparity> I'm thunderstruck by that acronym
[00:02:14] <opalvaults> FLOSS software is a fascinating psychological study on that ACDC concept.
[00:02:29] <codingquark> paraparity: I was thinking *the* same thing!
[00:02:30] <iob> i feel that this doesnt apply only to maintainers. So many managers should listen to it too
[00:02:55] <paraparity> It is really good advice to keep in mind as a manager

[00:03:46] <opalvaults> GUIX has a really great community, and has folk like 'jgart' mainly, that has package maintaince workshops where they invite newbies and experienced users alike to contribute packages to GUIX. 
[00:04:02] <tgbugs> one of the things that hasn't been brought up yet is maintainer territoriality, I know for many of my projects I can be quite territorial, sometimes unintentionally
[00:04:04] <opalvaults> That kind of contribution is invaluable for being an inviting environment for congtributing to a project.

[00:53:48] <pkal`> Interestingly enough even "Linux" has also been falling in popularity since 2004
[00:53:53] <iLemming> Vim is more popular today, because, unlike hardcore FSF advocates, those guys know that this world is not "white & black", and sometimes compromises has to be made.

[01:01:37] <vidianos`> mpv is <3
[01:01:50] <iLemming> Vim and Emacs are two distinct categories. The only thing that makes them similar is that they are both based on something. That something is an idea. And not just an ordinary, everyday concept, but an influential, holy grail type of thing. Vi and the concept of the modality is an incredible, powerful, fantastic model.

[01:03:04] <vidianos`> you never stop learning emacs
[01:03:11] <rwp> Popularity also adds to people breaking features that long time users like me use everyday but they don't see as popular and so they feel the need to break for something different.
[01:03:14] <ieure> cnngimenez, Very much the same, and I've been using Emacs for over 20 years.
[01:03:17] <opalvaults> I think a lot of popularity could be gotten from introducing more people in academic fields to Emacs. Org-Mode is such a game changer on that front.
[01:03:24] <cnngimenez> vidianos`: Nope, that's the best of Emacs!

Lisp, probably can be crowned as the most important idea in computer science. It just hard to think of something more influential than Lisp. Emacs is just a practical implementation (and frankly, not the best one) of that idea.

[01:20:34] <jrootabega> whoa
[01:20:37] <opalvaults> Does anyone more knowledgable than, maybe answer this question: Would there be any way to have other Lisps like Guile be compatible with Emacs?
[01:21:01] <opalvaults> It wraps C libraries well enough, and it's very performant. I think there was some effort to replace Emacs lisp?
[01:21:37] <kimjetwav> opalvaults: Guile has an Elisp interpreter in its compiler tower, however it's afaik not up to snuff for actually running Emacs.
[01:21:47] <NullNix> opalvaults: the problem is the "big datatypes" like buffers and strings, which guile either doesn't do at all or which need expensive bidirectional transcoding across the boundary
[01:21:59] <maxxcan> opalvaults: some like this? https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/docs/docs-1.8/guile-ref/Using-Guile-in-Emacs.html
[01:22:04] <NullNix> and of course *everything* in emacs touches buffers or strings
[01:22:26] <opalvaults> Gotcha, okay I'll have to read that link, and do a bit of research. I didn't realize that guile had an Elisp interp.
[01:22:31] <opalvaults> Thanks for the information!

[01:24:01] <TvE5> Greece
[01:24:10] <opalvaults> It was Org mode that got me into this because I needed a way to manage my ADHD, track projects with todo lists, etc. It has a very quick way to create a workflow that works well with my ADHD (org-roam for instance, for creating notes)

[01:26:34] <opalvaults> I'm very curious why everyone sees free software use, as "extreme".
[01:26:52] <opalvaults> It's not particularly "extreme" to advocate and use free software. Advocation is the only way to progress an ideology.
[01:26:55] <Cairn> I agree about it as a progression into programmiing. Great point
[01:26:57] <ieure> I think people who know other programming languages are more resistant to using Emacs Lisp than those who've never progammed.
[01:27:00] <ieure> *programmed
[01:27:00] <lounge-363> opalvaults well it is the same as vegan. 
[01:27:02] <opalvaults> What is "extreme" about sharing?
[01:27:04] <tgbugs> I mean ... statistically speaking, we kind of are.
[01:27:07] <lounge-544> I think seeing power users do the things they do with Emacs and Org-mode and how prolific they are is a major selling point (thinking of *so* many people, but say John Kitchin comes to mind) 
[01:27:08] <gnu_ninja> I do program, just not proffesionally :)

[01:27:26] <pkal`> Hard agree on the last point!
[01:27:32] <lounge-540> ieure: Yes, it seems that way
[01:27:34] <iLemming> @oaplvaults It's not the free-software itself, but the advocacy. Sometimes, FSF advocates take it to the extreme level.
[01:27:38] <gnu_ninja> oops, speling ;)
[01:27:48] <opalvaults> well lounge-363, as a vegan I won't get into that ;). But I feel as though free software, is even less "extreme" as veganism.
[01:27:52] <corwin> philosophical positions often feel "extreme" tho those who feel threatened or intimidated by them.
[01:28:09] <opalvaults> I agree corwin .
[01:28:37] <opalvaults> iLemming: I think that there's a conflation with thoughts and opinions that are counter than your own, and "extremeism"

[01:28:49] <iLemming> Any "philosophy" that has no compromises is indistinguishable from religious fanatism
[01:28:53] <tgbugs> free software is an attempt to create a space to reject ownership by using laws design to control ownership against themselves

[01:29:23] <lounge-363> opalvaults some users don't want to think about why they choose app X or app Y. a clear example for this is the slack proprietary app. it is way use for opensource software but it isn't the best option if you are talking about FSF 
[01:29:23] <opalvaults> by that logic iLemming there are so many movements in history that would never had happened if everyone in the movement had taken the "middle road", as it were.
[01:29:57] <opalvaults> Sometimes taking a hard line stance, creates a boundary, much like a personal and emotional one.
[01:30:00] <shoshin> i remembered to submit a talk this year because i tuned into a live stream with david
[01:30:15] <rwp> Oh!  So if David had had a bunch of emacs friends around him we would not have his YT channel!
[01:30:24] <opalvaults> And those are important to the progress of a movement, is discipline, or dedication to that ideology.
[01:30:27] <sachac> shoshin: and frownies is also out of that
[01:30:43] <vidianos`> daviwil: On this question, your Emacs From Scratch series was one of the major things that helped me switch from Spacemacs to my own config

[01:30:47] <corwin> rwp: lol
[01:30:58] <vidianos`> so yeah, your videos help a lot of people
[01:31:08] <tgbugs> the problem is that often elispers like to talk lisp, which can scare people off

[01:32:10] <lounge-544> To piggy back on a previous comment, I think if people kept seeing the top people in their fields (be in science/academic, software engineering, devops, etc.) use Emacs and Org-mode and especially their uniquely powerful features (literate style with org-babel, etc), Emacs would start taking over beyond it's historically low single digit % adoption
