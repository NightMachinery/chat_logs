[22:18:38] <menace> well what's the opinion on opensearch.org?
[22:21:18] <rawtaz> i havent heard of it before, but loooking at it now my opinion is that they truly suck at selling this. i cant even find a screenshot. theres literally nothing inviting except the text, if you can be arsed to read it
[22:21:52] <rawtaz> there should be some nice graphics or at least screenshots showing how awesome it is, on the front page
[22:24:08] <menace> you know that it's the free amazon ripof of elasticsearch?
[22:24:14] <menace> ripp-off*
[22:24:42] <menace> where they took elasticsearch, kibana xpack all the open parts, and rewrote the non open parts and published it? :D
[22:26:00] <rawtaz> no i just learnt about that
[22:26:06] <rawtaz> very briefly
[22:27:00] <menace> you mean, like now? :D
[22:27:50] <rawtaz> yep couple of minutes ago
[22:28:14] <rawtaz> hm was/is kibana and grafana based on elastic too?
[22:28:59] <menace> i think they do not really want to sell it, they want to make an example of the company elastic... and use it for themselves.. but if they do not "sell" it with docker-compose, nobody will have a look at it
[22:33:02] <menace> uh, they even wanna make debian packages
[22:34:01] <rawtaz> im not really following. are you saying amazon releasing this stuff open source now is a bad thing? isnt that better than them just using it behind their service without contributing back?
[22:37:33] <menace> well, yes and no. Elasticsearch did change their licensing, as companies like amazon did start using it and not paying at least a percent of a  fair dime. to be honest, both sites are shitty here, as elastic changed their license after building it with the help of the opensource community and amazon is shitty as this could be considered bullying.
[22:38:30] <menace> but i admit, personally i am glad that they publish it with the rbac stuff (xpack) as opensource, as many commercial opensource projects are more like opencore and hide this crucial component in their costly enterprise version
[22:57:54] <rawtaz> sounds like amazon were the shitty ones. elastic wouldnt change the license if they didnt feel a need to because of amazon's doings
[22:58:36] <menace> yeah, amazon is a little shittier than elastic. but it's a pigfight in the mud pretty much

[23:11:54] <rawtaz> i guess theyre doing the same with a lot of other open source software as well - leeching off it
[23:11:58] <rawtaz> e.g. postgresql
[23:16:18] <menace> yep
