[01:56:19] <prometh> regardless, it's complete to support both
[01:56:38] <systemfault> I've probably said it before... but I believe that DOM APIs are designed by Java interns
[01:56:54] <JordiGH> Ah, so that's why it's called Javascript.
[01:57:03] <prometh> originally
[01:57:12] <systemfault> Because, with the exception of fetch... they _all_ look like typical, highly OOP, Java APIs
[01:57:36] <prometh> for the most part, we shouldn't have to deal with dom code anyway
[01:57:39] <JordiGH> I bet if the same language were created today it would be called Rustscript.
[01:57:53] <Alexendoo> The old ones were designed to be language independent, which explains some of the unidiomatic...ness?
[01:58:06] <prometh> doubt it'll happen... there was already a js 2.0 (es4) that was abandoned
[01:58:26] <systemfault> Google also pushed Dart on the browser and failed.

[02:01:40] <prometh> oh, but i don't think they'll go dart; probably go js

[02:01:47] <systemfault> Yup

[03:29:17] <teresko> Buoy172: IMHO, it's the very opposite of how people should do CSS
[03:30:02] <theskillwithin> Buoy172 tailwind is very popular, and a lot of people like it.  I however very much dislike it and do not use it
[03:30:34] <systemfault> teresko: Yes, that's what I believe too... that said, the author at least tried to explain why using a blogpost...
[03:30:54] <systemfault> teresko: Blogpost on which I agree with the problems he cites... but not his solution (tailwind)
[03:32:23] <teresko> IIRC, most of those problems seemed to be fixable with people actually learning to use CSS
[03:32:47] <teresko> instead he came up with a software "solution" for a wetware problem
[03:33:44] <theskillwithin> its kind of annoying to have to learn a bunch of utility classes that only applies to one thing you might use on just one project.  when you already know css

[06:34:43] <systemfault> I cannot "not use" rebase in my workflow.
[06:35:02] <systemfault> Else, "main" would have tons of stupid commit messages
[06:35:17] <KevinX> you can squash them though, right?
[06:35:20] <systemfault> "LOLOOL" "Typo" "AJHDAKJHSDKJHASJDAJSD"
[06:35:34] <theskillwithin> squanch is another force but sure
[06:35:47] <KevinX> it's built into GH
[06:35:51] <systemfault> I squash while rebasing..
[06:36:46] <theskillwithin> im fine with a bunch of stupid commit messages.  but for organizational purposes it isnt ideal
[06:38:24] <KevinX> I tend to always write decent commit messages anyway
[06:38:31] <KevinX> sometimes "wip" though
[06:38:35] <systemfault> I'm not that disciplined... so I fix my sloppiness before pushing to master/main

[10:46:56] <gulzar> Hi. In this http://live.datatables.net/qatosohu/1/edit   . I have a small issue. the <td> contains <a> in mycase hence the = is not able to pickup the value . My td is in the comment of js section.   How can I check with the value of <a></a> within this th?   Another thing. To counter this issue I added my own class to <td
[10:46:57] <gulzar> class="dec_status_rehyb">   , and added colors in <style> . Issue: on jsfiddle the background of the cell gets changed with td . But on my machine td is not pciking up class values but the default bootstrap values (saw it in debug console). but the <a> within the td is able to get colors on my machine using class.

[11:15:50] <MootPoot> Alright guys, I have a question. I'm not a person who has any sense of visual design (and I do prefer backend stuff to frontend)....but I like writing code ( although I'm not very good ) and it seems like all the jobs around me are front end JS spots. What do I do?
[11:16:04] <MootPoot> I thought I didn't like JS for a long time but then I realized I just dont like the front end aspect of JS
[11:16:06] <MootPoot> which is most of it

[11:23:39] <gkatsev> definitely not everywhere, but yeah, probably a good portion
[11:24:18] <MootPoot> My last 3 full stack interviews were like "cool, so you know how to write backend stuff. So now tell me how well you know react, and show 3 react projects if you can"
[11:24:35] <MootPoot> we stopped talking about the back end stuff in like 10min and the other 50 was front

[16:39:17] <fweht> does anyone know when `document.fonts.ready` exactly fires?  because it has to load the style sheets before it knows which fonts to load, so it fires only after all the stylesheets have loaded?

[16:43:59] <ashnur> https://drafts.csswg.org/css-font-loading/#font-face-set-ready
[16:44:25] <blueagain> fweht: there is also this, which is a bit more detailed, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFaceSet/ready
[16:45:18] <fweht> thanks ashnur, blueagain
[16:45:58] <fweht> but i still see the default fonts flicker a few moments before the actual font is loaded, even though im rendering only after `document.fonts.ready` has fired :(
[16:46:02] <ashnur> it's surprisingly opaque to me too
[16:46:26] <ashnur> how do you specify your fonts?
[16:46:44] <fweht> via @font-face and then font-family in css
[16:47:05] <fweht> ah no the font-family part comes from js actually
[16:47:21] <blueagain> this is quite a powerful api, which could be the user case for it?
[16:47:35] <blueagain> aside from a meta use case like the google fonts website, where you dynamically switch fonts
[16:48:05] <blueagain> use case*
[16:48:32] <fweht> blueagain: maybe it works with the js fontface api?
[16:48:45] <fweht> i tried loading my fonts via js first, but got encoding errors
[16:48:58] <blueagain> fweht: yeah, I meant the js fontface api
[16:49:20] <blueagain> I was wondering when you'd actually need to do `var f = new FontFace("newfont", "url(newfont.woff)");`
[16:49:25] <fweht> ah yeah, so you think `document.fonts.ready` is useless when working with css?
[16:49:35] <blueagain> oh, I can think of another use case, web ide
[16:49:40] <blueagain> nvm, seems useful to me
[16:50:11] <ashnur> fweht, the draft says >" Authors should note that a given ready promise is only fulfilled once, but further fonts may be loaded after it fulfills. This is similar to listening for a loadingdone event to fire, but the callbacks passed to the ready promise will always get called"
[16:50:13] <blueagain> fweht: I don't think it's useless, at least not from the description on mdn and csswg
[16:50:48] <blueagain> fweht: what are you trying to achieve?
[16:51:50] <ashnur> fweht, so maybe you are listening too early, or not enough? :D
[16:52:14] <fweht> ashnur: hehe true

[16:58:04] <DPA> Text in wrong typefaces have an advantage over text that's not shown. It's still possible to read the text. Content is usually all I care for on websites, style is secondary.
[16:58:31] <fweht> DPA: its a website for a typedesigner showing his typefaces :)
[16:58:46] <blueagain> fweht: it's formulated pretty universally, "The ready attribute contains a Promise which is resolved when the document is done loading fonts,"
[16:58:47] <fweht> and there are 'buttons' which show single glyphs in the corresponding typefaces
[16:59:18] <blueagain> I can quickly check it locally as I only use css fonts
[16:59:21] <fweht> blueagain: ok, will play around with different timing, thanks so much for your help!
[17:00:03] <fweht> if my code is correct, the promise resolves, but the wrong font is still shown for a few frames
[17:00:08] <fweht> maybe its similar to image loading
[17:00:28] <fweht> where you have image.onload and image.decode, where decode fires after load
[17:02:18] <blueagain> fweht: here (chromium 100), the event gets triggered after I can see the fonts

[19:31:40] <FlorianBad> If I want to replace the content of a wrapper with many elements, is there any better way than doing  wrapper.innerHTML = ''   then   wrapper.appendChild()   a hundred times?
[19:31:59] <FlorianBad> I'm thinking there might be a way to prepare the whole thing in advance, then replace it all at once
[19:34:41] <friend> I'm sure there is since you can do it easily in jquery that way and jquery is just javascript.
[19:36:20] <FlorianBad> friend: and you think it's nothing something nicer than calling innerHTML and then append?
[19:36:23] <ashnur> you can create a documentfragment
[19:37:35] <ashnur> there is also replaceChildren
[19:38:00] <ashnur> lots of options basically, depending what your usecase is

[20:08:01] <FlorianBad> well I don't have them, it's going to be a big list of rows, but I can see the result of your code:  removeChild is 2.5x slower than innerHTML, and replaceChildren is only 2 to 20% slower, but innerHTML only clears, you have to count adding back the elements afterwards

[21:59:14] <sheetjs> webassembly text
[21:59:22] <ProfSimm> Oh.
[21:59:47] <sheetjs> if you've looked at assembly output, for example
[22:00:04] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: thanks, I have another question in expr like:  (func (param i32) (param i32) ...) how is (param i32) parsed exactly?
[22:00:23] <ProfSimm> Does it create some sort of value type "param" or is it just data or?
[22:00:57] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: in other words, does param parse relative to or by func, or independently of it, and is then passed to it
[22:01:41] <sheetjs> are you familiar with C?
[22:02:16] <sheetjs> basically, (param i32) is saying the function takes a parameter of type i32
[22:02:37] <sheetjs> you can associate it with a name like (param $x i32)
[22:02:46] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: sure I mean how is it parsed and executed in WAT's parser itself
[22:03:04] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: i.e. what happens if I just type (param i32) outside a function
[22:03:07] <sheetjs> are you asking how it's translated to wasm bytecode or how it translates to JS?
[22:03:35] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: the semantics of it while it's interpreted to WASM
[22:03:43] <ProfSimm> from text
[22:03:51] <ProfSimm> from s-expr more like
[22:04:36] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: basically I don't understand how WAT reduces semantically
[22:04:42] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: I understand the end result as WASM
[22:04:54] <ProfSimm> i.e. a func with params etc
[22:05:12] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: say I'm writing WAT parser and reducer that outputs WASM
[22:05:36] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: how would I be walking the s-expr and evaluating them in what order. Where is "param' looked up
[22:06:05] <sheetjs> so the function itself is opcode 0x60
[22:06:21] <sheetjs> then there's the number of parameters
[22:06:53] <sheetjs> (func (param i32) (param i32) ...) assume there are no other parameters, then the next byte in the stream would be 0x02
[22:07:13] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: sorry I don't mean that, I mean before WASM

[22:08:05] <sheetjs> ProfSimm: the question is unclear
[22:08:42] <sheetjs> there's WAT (the lisp-esque text format) and WASM (the bytecode format)
[22:08:56] <sheetjs> (func (param i32) (param i32) ...) is WAT
[22:09:03] <ashnur> MRDPZK, show code
[22:09:07] <sheetjs> if you are asking about the grammar, https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/text/index.html
[22:09:13] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: I'll demonstrate with JS.  I wanna know does this s-expr tree parse more like the first JS example or the second one:     func(param(i32), param(i32), ...)    {func: [{param: i32}, {param: i32}, ...]

[22:12:32] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: if there's a grammar, then I should be thinking about the s-expr as tokens
[22:12:40] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: expressions

[22:14:35] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: I should've asked the question more like is WAT reduced like code like JS, or parsed like a data format, like JSON. Seems the latter.
[22:14:59] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: it's like a JSON with a schema (grammar)
[22:15:00] <sheetjs> WAT is best compared to x86_64 or aarch64 mnemonics

[22:15:39] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: maybe but the fact it uses s-expr makes it look different to me. I thought there's some generic execution model that turns this into WASM

[22:15:49] <ProfSimm> sheetjs: instead it's more like syntax for WASM
[22:15:53] <sheetjs> x86_64 for example the bytes 0xba 0x70 0x17 0x00 0x00 translates to the mnemonic "movl $6000, %edx"

[22:21:48] <MRDPZK> yes
[22:22:27] <austincheney> MRDPZK, I think the problem is the variable name "rejects".  You are using that as a function name and also inferring it as an argument. (guessing)

[22:22:59] <MRDPZK> https://github.com/pazooki/Write2Die/issues/1

[22:28:08] <austincheney> ProfSimm, its an arrow function.  The implicit "this" is lexical opposed to pointing to the call stack, but otherwise its just an anonymous function like any other anonymous function
[22:28:31] <ProfSimm> austincheney: my point was, why is the token => and not ->
[22:29:02] <austincheney> ProfSimm, because that is the syntax rule they decided upon
[22:29:15] <ProfSimm> austincheney: :/
[22:29:26] <ProfSimm> austincheney: that's a nice tech support level 1 answer
[22:29:32] <austincheney> ProfSimm, why should it be -> or anything else?
[22:30:02] <ProfSimm> austincheney: -> is the original arrow function syntax. And arrow has one line, not two
[22:30:30] <austincheney> in JavaScript => is the first and only arrow syntax
[22:30:54] <ProfSimm> austincheney: I'm talking before JS
