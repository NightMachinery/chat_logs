[00:52:18] <edm> Lox to treat water seems a bit extreme
[00:53:40] <riv> huh people upvoted that wall of text comment
[00:54:07] <riv> maybe it was good
[01:05:33] <quanticle> ngoldbaum: Holy shit.
[01:06:06] <quanticle> edm: I think it's used to make ozone? I know that ozonation is an alternative to chlorination for treating water.
[01:06:24] <quanticle> I did not realize that ozonation required liquid oxygen.
[01:07:45] <quanticle> Ah, apparently it's needed for larger systems: https://spartanwatertreatment.com/ozone-generator-lox-systems/
[01:10:04] <quanticle> Geez this is reminiscent of some of the scenes coming out of India, where they were shutting down steel mills so that they could divert oxygen to hospitals.
[01:11:38] <riv> i hate hearing about this it scares me so much and i feel bad for the sick people
[01:12:47] <quanticle> Same
[01:14:12] <quanticle> And, I feel bad for saying this, but when it was India, it was almost understandable in a way. India is not a rich country, and it has a lot of people and a lot of those people are in places that are underserved by medical facilities, so when a pandemic hits, there's not a lot of spare capacity.
[01:14:33] <quanticle> Here? Florida? Come on. We should be able to handle this

[01:46:09] <edm> (Propulsion)
[01:46:34] <quanticle> Oh. When said "burning" I was thinking more along the lines of burning bars and thermal lances
[01:47:02] <quanticle> Which, now that I think about it, you probably also use for that
[01:47:13] <riv> i feel frustrated, recently ive only had really shallow engagement with topics. i want to study something in depth
[01:47:16] <quanticle> Welding requires a lot of oxygen too
[01:52:25] <edm> Or very little!
[01:52:41] <edm> For work we put lots of effort into displacing oxygen during welding
[01:53:09] <quanticle> Oh, fair enough
[01:53:25] <quanticle> I was thinking of oxy-acetylene, not like MIG or TIG
[01:53:27] <edm> Electric welding rather than gas obv
[01:53:30] <edm> Yeah
[01:54:18] <edm> Often have to weld plumbing for lox, needs very clean ox free welding environment then very careful cleaning and passivation
[01:54:29] <edm> Any grit or slag can set the whole thing off
[01:57:27] <quanticle> Yeah, I was reading a book called _Inviting Disaster_, which is about industrial accidents, and it has an entire chapter on all the ways liquid oxygen can go wrong
[01:57:44] <edm> Yes it’s a good book

[02:00:00] <edm> Etc etc
[02:07:20] <quanticle> Yeah, _Ignition!_ is on my to-read list
[02:17:15] <edm> I reread it once a yr, always pick up something new
[02:17:26] <edm> And it’s professionally useful

[16:05:34] <Xe> quanticle: oh I meant asked
[16:16:04] <quanticle> My reply to that question would be that Evangelion is a deconstruction of many of the common mecha anime tropes popularized by Gundam, Macross, etc.
[16:16:46] <quanticle> The pilot isn't a hotshot. He's just a scared kid. He doesn't instinctively know how to take charge of his craft, he literally falls flat on his face.
[16:17:14] <quanticle> He doesn't somehow find strength within himself and overcome adversity; no he just spirals ever deeper into trauma
[16:17:45] <quanticle> Basically Evangelion asks, "If you took a real teenager and put them in a situation where the fate of the world was riding on their shoulders, how would they react?"
[16:18:49] <quanticle> And the answer isn't, "Oh, he'd find the strength within himself and save the world like the heroes in books or movies," it's, "He'd snap like friggin' twig, you idiot."
[16:22:42] <Xe> i set them up for the subversion: "It's basically a mecha anime where the main character has to pilot a hilariously powerful mecha against unknown entities named Angels that are attacking Tokyo-3"

[22:57:07] <pja> In the UK/EU if you trust the TV manufacturer you might be able to turn off the tracking in the TV. But you still risk getting ads.
[22:57:33] <manicennui> I read that there are some TVs made for commercial purposes that don't have any "smart" features.
[22:57:53] <pja> You can’t even say “oh, I’ll just never connect it to the internet” these days, because mobile chipsets are cheap enough, or it could piggy back on a neighbour’s wifi.
[22:58:08] <pja> manicennui: Yeah & they’re correspondingly more expensive. It’s annoying.
[22:58:35] <manicennui> It's not going to hack your neighbor's wifi.

[23:02:59] <pja> Nobody wants to sell a dumb TV, because they can’t compete on price with a crappy “smart” TV that sells your TV watching data to third parties & can therefore discount the up front price of the TV below cost.
[23:03:16] <manicennui> There aren't enough of us that actually want dumb TVs.
[23:03:24] <pja> (Or at least discount the manufacturer price - the retailer is still taking a profit obvs.)

[23:05:05] <pja> Probably a fair bit I imagine & you could sell that same data to every other streaming service. That’s before you even start in on selling what people are actually watching.

[23:18:41] <manicennui> And they can decide to stop supporting the software.

[23:20:24] <gerikson> manicennui: yeah long-term use is the main issue for me too
[23:20:25] <manicennui> Just kind of tired of computers in general.
[23:20:58] <manicennui> Ideally we'd have really advanced technology that does really hard things but is not front and center all the time.
[23:22:06] <manicennui> Instead we have really mediocre technology that makes things that weren't that hard slightly more convenient and is always obnoxious.
[23:22:25] <manicennui> And most decisions are made based on selling you more shit, not making a good product.
[23:24:45] <manicennui> This is one of my biggest problems with YC: whenever they fund something in an area with real problems (e.g. healthcare), it is always about extracting money from that area with "solutions" to really trivial problems.

[23:31:35] <cot> :/
[23:32:04] <manicennui> Probably just good Christian men who need to ask Jesus for forgiveness.
[23:32:20] <cot> What does Christianity have to do with this?
[23:33:31] <manicennui> Right-wing Christian wackos love to come up with conspiracy theories about progressives being pedos, but they are caught all the time, and then their attitude changes completely.
[23:33:55] <cot> uh huh.
[23:34:02] <manicennui> The majority of people attending Sturgis are almost certainly right-wing assholes.
[23:34:05] <cot> True, not denying that it happens
[23:34:14] <cot> I have no idea wht Sturgis is, just hearing about it now
[23:34:18] <manicennui> Same reason they didn't cancel it last year.
[23:34:32] <manicennui> It's one of the largest motorcycle rallies in the country every year.

[23:35:55] <cot> Ah, well, if they're attending a rally in the middle of a global pandemic it wouldn't surprise me if they're all right-wing covid denyers
[23:36:10] <cot> Though denying covid is getting harder and harder
[23:36:31] <cot> It's funny to see some of the people I know/seen completely change their stance on things as the pandemic wears on

[23:37:39] <manicennui> cot: I think fewer of them outright deny it, but a lot of them think that if you are a tough guy it won't hurt you.
[23:37:47] <manicennui> And of course they have wild theories about the vaccine.

[23:49:59] <cot> Does the title of the post just shared in the other channel make you think he might be a spammer? Seemed like anotehr red flag to me
[23:50:15] <cot> well, not "spam", but low-quality posts
[23:54:57] <gwozniak> cot: definitely suspect
