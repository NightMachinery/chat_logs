[00:58:47] <pi0> how it starts
[01:00:18] <pi0> sorry not sure what you mean
[01:01:03] <cousteau> It looks like a number has an integer part, an optional fraction part, and an optional exponent 
[01:02:13] <cousteau> So you start with "a number has an integer part, an optional fraction part, and an optional exponent", then describe what each of those parts means in more detail, and then implement it 
[01:03:20] <pi0> [0-9] is the start
[01:03:43] <cousteau> [0-9] is "any digit" 
[01:04:01] <pi0> but they are ints
[01:04:04] <cousteau> [0-9]+ is "any sequence of one or more digits" 
[01:04:41] <cousteau> No, regex doesn't see ints, it only sees digits without any meaning 
[01:04:53] *** Quits: Xavier7 (~Xavier7@179.6.154.96) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:05:23] <cousteau> It sees digits, dots, letters, signs, and tries to match the pattern 
[01:06:16] <cousteau> That's why you need to know what you need to write before writing it.  For example, the integer part is going to be a sequence of one or more digits, right? 
[01:06:31] <pi0> true
[01:06:41] <cousteau> Then that part of the regex will look like [0-9]+
[01:06:55] <pi0> hmm i think [0-9]+ now i need the .
[01:07:05] <pi0> yes
[01:07:42] <pi0> is there a way to say only 1 occurance of a .
[01:07:48] <cousteau> Then the optional fraction part.  You can mark optional subpatterns by wrapping them in ( ) and appending an ? 
[01:08:03] <cousteau> Yes, \. 
[01:08:19] <pi0> [0-9]+\.
[01:08:28] <cousteau> (since . has a special meaning, "any character") 
[01:08:54] <cousteau> Looks good.  Now one or more digits on the fractional part 
[01:09:59] <pi0> looks like 2 digits after the decimal
[01:10:15] <cousteau> No, any number of digits 
[01:11:10] <pi0> the kleen start again
[01:11:57] <pi0> [0-9]+\.[0-9]+
[01:12:11] <pi0> i think 
[01:12:16] <pi0> the last part
[01:12:20] <pi0> only accounts for 1 digit
[01:12:25] <pi0> within that range
[01:12:30] <pi0> not more than a single digit
[01:16:39] <pi0> i think i might be a bit long

[02:10:26] <jargon> I didn't change anything yet.
[02:10:39] <OnlineCop> That's why I was suggesting that you use the  |\G  construct.
[02:10:54] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/SRGsbg/3 is the start of what I was talking about.
[02:11:09] <jargon> I wasn't here for that, I had a delivery from Walmart at my door.
[02:11:15] <OnlineCop> It's got an optional "IF RND(1)...END IF" group.
[02:11:33] <jargon> Yeah, that part is the dice roll mechanics.
[02:11:58] <OnlineCop> That gives 5 matches, but the trouble is when you try to match any of these options out-of-order.
[02:12:30] <OnlineCop> There are a lot of options in other areas that aren't available in the single match you had found earlier. Do you need each of those to be named as well?

[02:17:40] <jargon> like this ${prfl.armr}
[02:19:10] <OnlineCop> A `.` isn't a valid character in a named group. Just underscore or letters/digits.
[02:23:15] <jargon> How does |\G work?
[02:24:31] <OnlineCop> It continues matching from where a previous match stopped. So it has to have matched something previously for it to "continue" matching its own line.
[02:25:22] <jargon> Show me please.

[02:33:30] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/SRGsbg/5
[02:33:46] <OnlineCop> True. There are a lot of moving parts here, and regex is probably NOT the right tool to do the actual substitutions.
[02:34:39] <OnlineCop> Then there are lines 231-237 that break a lot of the logic.
[02:40:07] <OnlineCop> Line 254 has "prflidty$ = roe.door" but the regex is expecting a double-quoted string there.
[02:40:18] <OnlineCop> Namely: `\s*(?:prfl)(?:idty)\$\s+=\s+"(?<card_name>(?:[A-Z][a-z]*(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]*){0,2}))"`
[02:40:32] <jargon> You mean this? https://regex101.com/r/SRGsbg/6
[02:41:09] <jargon> Yeah, that is what I mean by dice rolls.
[02:41:29] <OnlineCop> I don't entirely understand what you're trying to do with regex.
[02:41:36] <OnlineCop> Are you trying to replace some values? Combine values?
[02:42:22] <jargon> I am attempting to isolate and extract card initializations so that I may store them in independent resource files.

[02:42:57] *** vh is now known as vhx
[02:43:50] <OnlineCop> But why name each of the capture groups? Wouldn't it be easier to quickly identify the beginning of some "IF rfg$ = ... THEN ... END IF" block and just extract the whole thing to an independent file?
[02:45:08] <jargon> I need to be able to confirm in advance that I am not exporting junk code.
[02:45:28] <OnlineCop> I'd think that the "IF rfg$ = roe.something THEN GOSUB prflblnk" would be fairly common to these (I see 13 matches with these two lines).
[02:45:33] <jargon> Because it is in need of the regex regardless,
[02:45:54] <OnlineCop> It'll take longer to write the regex than to just manually find those 13 matches and proof whether they're junk code.
[02:46:42] <jargon> My code updates on its own due to transcendental behaviors. I need it to mount the data wholesale.
[02:47:01] <OnlineCop> You used words that I didn't grok.
[02:47:17] <jargon> My program code is haunted.
[02:53:31] <jargon> My code keeps being modified from back in 1997. So I need a filter to trap the changes.
[02:55:05] <jargon> In otherwords, a parallel universe copy of myself keeps updating the code.
[02:55:43] <jargon> ..if that makes any sense to you.
[02:57:57] <jargon> This is why the code is 74kb and barely runs in QBasic 1.1 / QuickBASIC 4.5

[02:58:24] <jargon> Dump to external files.
[02:58:26] <OnlineCop> Why regex out variables that may end up in a different order?
[02:59:04] <jargon> I need the dump to be uniform.
[02:59:17] <OnlineCop> Can't you simply dump an entire "IF rfg$ = roe.[name] THEN gosub roe.[name]" ?
[02:59:40] <jargon> Because I need it formatted for proper loading from config.
[03:00:09] <OnlineCop> Your substitution is going to be a mess. If you expect there to be "prflpirc" in one match, but it doesn't exist in another, then you're going to be substituting _something_ for "prflpirc" which will end up being invalid for the other locations that are missing it.
[03:01:04] <jargon> The default value is supposed to be handled by card-wide default values.
[03:01:18] <jargon> pirc = pierce.
[03:01:42] <jargon> default value is always zero.
[03:02:33] <OnlineCop> Then... copy all those matches into the new files. Add each of the missing variables, with a default value of 0. Overwrite those values lower in the file.
[03:03:28] <OnlineCop> If you've got all of those variables defaulted to 0 up above and end up never using them, there's no problem, and no "undefined!" error when you run it.
[03:03:47] <OnlineCop> For the variables that were defaulted to 0 but then have a new value given to them, their new values will be reflected anyway.
[03:03:58] <OnlineCop> It's not like these are being defined as `const` values.
[03:05:28] <jargon> roe.foo is a constant var name.,
[03:05:49] <jargon> 4 chars.
[03:06:28] <jargon> [a-z]+[a-z0-9]{0,3}
[03:06:52] <jargon> it would validate as "foo_"
[03:07:20] <jargon> however I refer to it by its variable name, not its value.
[03:08:44] <jargon> OnlineCop, prflblnk overwrites the card space with the default values.
[03:09:22] <jargon> prflblnk is a call to a routine.
[03:10:05] <jargon> prflset binds the new values to the current card space.
[03:10:22] <jargon> also a routine.
[03:10:42] <OnlineCop> Understanding the current logic doesn't help me understand what you're trying to do with a regular expression, though.
[03:11:21] <jargon> I am wanting to autonomously export all card definitions in the project to individual config files.
[03:12:19] <vhx> is there a way to formulate this regex so that, in the second match, the contents of the first <p> tag are a separate (preferably named) entity?

[03:52:04] <vhx> (it's terrible markup which is why i'm using regex to deal with it)
[03:52:15] <OnlineCop> I was just wondering whether the <p...> logic could be simplified.
[03:52:24] <OnlineCop> Should "Court de Gébelin also stated..." match at all?
[03:52:24] <vhx> so that explicit inline style identifies the right tags. - yeah, unfortunately no

[03:52:31] <vhx> no
[03:52:35] <vhx> that's not part of the quote text
[03:52:46] <vhx> hence the different inline style - 23pt left padding instead of 40+

[06:16:14] <jargon> https://regex101.com/r/pgZ5hH/1/ Why does this not match?
[06:17:05] <jargon> I used DosBox and QB4.5 to isolate the data by hand
[06:17:35] <jargon> I just need PHP8/PCRE2 to separate the data into separate files.
[06:18:57] <purplex> regex101 doesn't support \r @ jargon
[06:23:07] <purplex> it seems you are trying to match two lines after the 'CASE' but your {2} is attached to newline
[06:23:10] <jargon> purplex, then how do I do it?
[06:23:44] <jargon> I am trying to capture each card initialization via label
[06:24:33] <jargon> CASE "foo_" is the card label.
[06:24:43] <jargon> the rest is its params.
[06:26:12] <jargon> I am trying to capture every thing from CASE up to the first blank line thereafter.
[06:26:21] *** Joins: Xavier7 (~Xavier7@179.6.154.96)
[06:27:21] <purplex> Capturing all initializations will need a regex for each entry, just like your previous regexes
[06:29:40] <purplex> here's how to start https://regex101.com/r/pgZ5hH/2
[06:30:25] <purplex> your rules of how to capture seem a lot restrictive
[06:30:59] <Xavier7> hi purplex
[06:31:15] <purplex> you want first letter to be 'small' one and rest of them to be small and have digits (including _) and such
[06:31:34] <jargon> Yes.
[06:31:52] <jargon> total of 4 characters
[06:32:24] <jargon> This is a valid card name "fo3_
[06:32:26] <jargon> This is a valid card name "fo3_"
[06:32:57] <jargon> This is also valid "____"
[06:33:13] <jargon> [a-z_][a-z0-9_]{3}
[06:34:00] <jargon> however "____" uses the variable name "roe.blnk"
[06:34:42] <jargon> [a-z_][a-z0-9_]{3} bad, [a-z][a-z0-9_]{3} good
[06:34:50] <jargon> "____" is the only exception.
[06:35:28] <jargon> for example "foo_" would be "roe.foo"
[06:36:26] <jargon> "____" is an unassigned card.
[06:37:24] <jargon> A card slot that isn't even being used is 0 in binary.
[06:40:32] <purplex> you can do (_{4}|[a-z][a-z0-9_]{3}) for unassigned card
[06:42:26] <jargon> An usused cart slot is 32bits of zero in binary
[06:43:03] <jargon> unassgined and unused are not the same thing.
[06:43:14] <jargon> unassigned* vs unused
[06:44:15] <purplex> how do you represent 'unused' in CASE form?
[06:44:18] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-239-62-159.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[06:44:19] <jargon> unassigned is like "MissiNo" in Pokemon.,
[06:44:47] <jargon> It doesn't get represented, it just ignores it.
[06:45:22] <jargon> "CASE" is just some source code from a switch statement
[06:46:22] <jargon> In the resulting card *.dat files , the CASE won't be there.
[06:46:26] <purplex> right but its not a variable, it uses a string 
[06:47:33] <purplex> do you check something like var = "" if its unused?
[06:48:04] <jargon> If its unused its MKL(0)
[06:48:40] <jargon> stats on the otherhand are MKS(foo)
[06:48:49] <jargon> stats on the otherhand are MKS(foo!)
[06:49:21] <jargon> it stores stat values as MKS(foo!) values.
[06:49:46] <jargon> when it reloads them it gets them from CVS(foo$)
[06:50:22] <jargon> ! is 16bit floats, $ is a string
[06:50:42] <purplex> good, so can you write your regex to match further entries, now that you learned it doesn't use \r?
[06:50:46] <jargon> (In QBasic)
[06:51:27] <jargon> How do I slice up that file with the regex? from earlier
[06:51:31] <purplex> i have no idea how you'd want to match those "prflidty" stuff.

[20:13:36] <vhx> digitok lmao why am i not surprised? is it PCRE+ or just really quirky?
[20:14:01] <digitok> it's pretty advanced
[20:14:09] <digitok> not really based on pcre
[20:14:29] <vhx> good to know. i must not be doing anything too advanced yet cause regex101's pcre works in my script
[20:15:43] <vhx> incidentally, i got help with this last night and like a dummy deleted it, because it's a copyrighted project and i didn't intend on sharing the complete text of an entire chapter. i'm trying to fix this: https://regex101.com/r/Yq7Sfp/1
[20:15:58] <vhx> what i want is for the text contents in *every* <p> tag in a given match to come back as a capture group
[20:15:58] <digitok> it's basically pcre minus \K, recursion, verbs; plus variable length lookbehind, balancing groups, quantified capture group stacking
[20:18:28] <digitok> meaning <last>?
[20:19:02] <vhx> kind of. in the second match for example, there are two paragraphs, but the capture group for the contents of the P tag only got the second one
[20:19:28] <vhx> the reason i have the two capture groups, first and last, is for my script, to compare whether or not the entire match equals last (if it does, i handle it differently)
[20:19:56] <digitok>  you can get that in .net, that's the last feature i mentioned above which pcre lacks
[20:20:03] <vhx> orly
[20:20:18] <vhx> do you mean that my current regex SHOULD capture both paragraphs as desired?
[20:20:24] <digitok> .net will store every repetition rather than just the last
[20:20:30] <vhx> i see
[20:20:44] <vhx> well damn. i'll have to take a look at that match result in ps then
[20:20:53] <vhx> i don't suppose you know of any .net based online regex validator do you
[20:21:17] <vhx> i can't find any UWP ones that do what online validators do, with the match as you type and the detailed information about your match results
