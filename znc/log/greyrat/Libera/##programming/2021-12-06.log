[03:47:54] <[itchyjunk]> So there is no way around this outside of registering an account? unfortunate
[03:48:05] <[itchyjunk]> youtube has age restricted all sorts of things lately
[03:48:15] <locutus> ipfs and yt-dl?
[03:48:32] <InPhase> Embed worked as a workaround for a year or more, but then they disabled it.  youtube-dl seems to still bypass age restrictions though.

[03:49:38] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: I just use youtube-dl and don't look at the source, but you can certainly look through their source to see their magic for bypassing.
[03:49:46] <[itchyjunk]> the recommendation system goes total haywire after logging in and searching for stuff
[03:50:14] <[itchyjunk]> youtube dl can't be using an account to do it, else youtube would just ban that
[03:50:20] <[itchyjunk]> wonder what tricks they use
[03:50:21] <InPhase> Yeah.  Youtube only works okay in private mode if you close the browser routinely.  Otherwise you get echo-chambered real fast.
[03:50:26] <[itchyjunk]> but not enough to look through the code

[05:34:06] <PlanckWalk> The best way is to write a program that parses the questions and writes the solution for you.

[05:38:35] <rue_mohr> the main loop is busy shoveling the positions

[08:44:07] <l2> or we add sugar to a water - so additions are transformative
[08:44:09] <ejjfunky> it's like saying you have a filled cup full of water. so if you put in two spoons of more water, it won't change. that's natural
[08:44:50] <ejjfunky> l2, adding sugar will change the mass of the water
[08:44:56] <l2> yep
[08:45:08] <l2> and sugar will be gone in a way :)
[08:45:17] <ejjfunky> not gone, just change of state

[08:45:23] <l2> in a way
[08:45:51] <ejjfunky> also, ever slightly, it'll also change the volume

[08:46:26] <l2> additions can be used for counting in some cases not all - cause some times adding different things together make a new thing
[08:47:12] <l2>  1 + 1 = 2, and 2 + 2 != 4, then 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 != 4 - here also 1 + 1 =2 is a matter of agreement that it is a case 
[08:47:31] <l2> it is a case in many cases 
[08:47:46] <ejjfunky> l2, on that statement, i agree. adding some things like 1 + 1, doesn't always equate to 2

[08:48:55] <l2> emptying or changing or filling - point of reference if a man pours beer out of a bottle Xd
[08:49:13] <ejjfunky> for example, for a population (humans, animals) of a pair of male and female do not equate to 2 more. It can be 0, 1 or > 1
[08:49:45] <beaky> nice so advent of code problem 2 makes you write a simple interpreter

[14:25:17] <vdamewood> nomagno: Nope. C.

[14:25:57] <nomagno> Fair enough

[14:27:14] <nomagno> I have found C enables a certain kind of portability you just don't get anywhere else
[14:27:22] <d3x0r> the ability to use C code from node was such a better experience than C#  (that was my last preferrred language)
[14:27:29] <nomagno> Any non-frontend code can be compiled to all kinda of funky platforms/VMs
[14:27:38] <nomagno> You then write the frontend code per platform

[14:30:05] <bayaz> Title: Highlights of the Web Almanac 2021 
[14:30:18] <nomagno> d3x0r: It takes a fair bit of dedication (and debugging) to write C code that you can look at and say "Alright, this runs on all systems it could possibly be wanted on". If you do it tough, you can write off that part of the backend code as fully portable
[14:30:20] <d3x0r> with C you have a very small audience that can use an App from the C source state vs say JS 
[14:30:27] * mrig is perhaps bitter because the vim mode is so bad.
[14:30:54] <d3x0r> nomagno ya sorta ... I dunno
[14:31:26] <ent58> With C you have to have some dedication to splitting the codebase in clear system dependent chunks
[14:31:30] <d3x0r> the whole 'write once comiple anywhere' idea is good in genral but for a sufficently complex task that becomes really difficult...
[14:31:41] <d3x0r> this comipler has to take options this way on this platform... and another way over there...
[14:32:00] <arahael> Write an emulator! Done! ;)
[14:32:00] <ent58> d3x0r: I still think that ultimately _should_ be the way to go, but isn't because windows. ;-;
[14:32:01] <d3x0r> wasm's a better hope for at least compile once, run anywhere :)
[14:32:05] <mrig> d3x0r isn't that just inevitable though?
[14:32:19] <arahael> d3x0r: wasm runs in an virtual machine, though...
[14:32:19] <mrig> There is always baggage.
[14:32:36] <d3x0r> arahael it's simple enough that it's native code in a virtual model
[14:32:36] <nomagno> d3x0r: You must understand the difference between bytecode and programming language, surely
[14:32:42] *** Quits: cursey (~cursey@user/cursey) (Quit: bye)
[14:32:51] <d3x0r> there's a quick translation phase like .NET bytecode
[14:33:00] <mrig> Just a matter of choice as to where or how that baggage is delivered.
[14:33:07] <nomagno> I write a simply VM in C for arbitrary code execution. Surprisingly effective
[14:33:54] <nomagno> It's not very powerful, but if you really need something that can only be figured out by changing the code and runtime, it's a good option
[14:34:04] <nomagno> A portable VM, the most absurd idea ever :)
[14:34:58] <Square> Ive never taken part in advent of code. How is it laid out? Does problems get increasingly hard? Do you publish code on their site? 
[14:35:02] <ent58> my dream is a return to bare metal, for everything, because we've figured out how to turn C++ into a nuclear-powered swiss army knife, and can abstract all the down the chain
[14:35:30] <d3x0r> Square they vary ... probably generally more hard but they're mixed up - you can only solve up to the current day so if you start now you get 6 you can solve
[14:35:58] <d3x0r> no you give them the answer your code gives you.... 
[14:36:04] <d3x0r> you don't have to publish your code
[14:36:09] <nomagno> ent58: "Figured out". You mean bruteforced beyond comprehension into a language that can only be implemented by a commercial or fairly widely backed team?
[14:36:20] <Square> d3x0r, ah ok. so answers are not published before xmas so to speak?
[14:36:26] <nomagno> It works. But I'm not sure it was the best option
[14:36:38] <d3x0r> well you get a pass/fail for each you do - but they're unlocked 1 day at a time
[14:36:56] <d3x0r> and if you fail you can retry without apparent penalty
[14:37:15] <ent58> :[  so Square, I don't like that fact either. It would be nice if there was a language that aspired to zero-cost abstraction that was far more....assembled from openly engineered parts, and not a monolith
[14:37:20] <d3x0r> just ya know it takes you longer cause you have to do more
[14:37:21] <ent58> but I'm not aware of one

[14:49:55] <ent58> d3x0r: what if we had a portable assembly language? I'm talking like a cleaned up version of hand writing LLVM pseudoinstructions, but with quality of life features
[14:50:05] <cykid128> cuz C++ is one of the most used language in gamedev
[14:50:16] <nomagno> d3x0r: C defines enough behaviour you can take a bit of care and write fully portable code. Some things, like floats and (until recently) signed integers, necessarily require knowing about the target system
[14:50:42] <nomagno> C23 will just mandate 2's complement, which is reasonable I guess
[14:50:46] <ent58> ah yes, the golden goose of signed-is-two's-complement

[15:02:22] <ent58> there are certain super complicated abstractions you can look through as a meatbrain and beat a compiler, but I think on a very large scale you'll run into a wall.

[15:44:32] <sonny> you are not testing portability, but compilers?

[15:45:12] <vdamewood> cl's such an exotic compiler it only supports one operating system, and current versions only support two architectures.
[15:45:13] <nomagno> Guest845: That takes practice and a through understanding of the basic premise of the ISO standard

[17:24:40] <be_free> some fool was arguing, I think yesterday, that the shortage of GPUs that is in part caused by crypto miners is not at all, not even in part, caused by them. So, here is an article for that fool: https://www.pcworld.com/article/395041/nvidia-lhr-explained-what-is-a-lite-hash-rate-gpu.html And I wonder if new GPUs are gimped with LHR just in software (i.e. that we can reprogram the firmware) or if they are gimped in hardware 
[17:24:40] <be_free> somehow. Basically, you get a GPU like RTX 3090 and it's with LHR to keep you from getting high hash rates when using it for mining. That way, you are gonna let gamers buy that GPU.

[17:55:24] <deniska> and the latter, uhm, can be fun, for some people, for some period of time :)
[17:55:26] <apotheon> Having, for instance, "smart quotes" code in the core, only "removable" either by actual deletion of code or writing an extension that tries valiantly to painstakingly deconvert them, is *bad*.

[19:40:34] <DPA> I kind of dislike the idea of open source software for monetary gain. People just writing what they need, useful code shared for the benefit of everyone, taking and giving, is what I believe OSS is all about.
[19:40:34] <DPA> I feel that, things like Open Core, and Businesses doing OSS, fundamentally break this dynamic. Is there a copyleft license, similar to open source licenses, but with a non-commercial use clause? I would like to make businesses instead of people pay. Free for people, but another license for businesses with a decent size.
[19:41:10] <vdamewood> DPA: A non-commercial use clause is directly against the open-source definition.

[19:44:30] <DPA> Most commercial software requires contributors to sign CLAs. Open Core is a popular model. That's used to allow them to add good stuff to a paied business software, annd not adding it to the free OSS version.

[19:47:47] <apotheon> Copyleft license terms are only *barely* open source and free software.
[19:48:11] <apotheon> "technically not non-commercial" is apt
[19:48:12] <nomagno> My internal dilemma is, if I use permissive/Copyfree licenses, people can release proprietary versions, which I don't like. If I use copyleft licenses, people can't combine it however they want, which I don't like
[19:48:14] <apotheon> technically
[19:48:47] <nomagno> Can't I add some clause to a license so you can only combine it with software under a license that grants the four freedoms too?
[19:48:56] <nomagno> That would be ideal
[19:49:03] <apotheon> nomagno: While I dislike someone incorporating copyfree code into a closed source work, what I dislike more is at least these two things:
[19:49:07] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@141.136.79.85)

[19:49:21] *** Quits: geenvoud (~geenvoud@user/geenvoud) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[19:49:50] <DPA> If there was no proprietary version with more important functionality, people would have to put it in the open version. There are often people contributing things, but they land in the proprietary version if they are important. And forking such projects can be difficult. This is how I think Open Core hurts FOSS.
[19:50:00] <apotheon> 2. the fact that copyleft implementations hinder widespread adoption of important open protocols
[19:50:08] <nomagno> I specifically want a license that only allows combinations with works under licenses that meet the OSI/Free Software definition
[19:50:17] <apotheon> (or, even worse, copyleft *protocols* and implementations)
[19:50:20] <nomagno> Yes, some people won't like it. I don't care.
[19:50:46] <apotheon> Unfortunately, that still impedes protocol adoption.
[19:51:01] <apotheon> That's my main issue with that idea.
[19:51:25] <apotheon> On a case-by-case basis, overall, protocols are more important than implementations.
[19:51:28] <nomagno> The benefits still outweigh the drawbacks for me. You can think differently

[19:55:13] <apotheon> (in my estimation)
[19:55:41] <DPA> I don't really understand, why we don't make at least big businesses pay for software, but keep it free for people / individuals. Any mention of the idea is always rejected imediatly as fundamentally non-free.
[19:55:52] <nomagno> I might attempt to botch the COIL into doing that... is the COIL text copyrighted, or does copyright not apply to licenses?
[19:55:54] <apotheon> The second most obvious way would be weird, because you'd basically have to translate the OSD into legalese and include it in the license text.
[19:57:04] <apotheon> DPA: If you can get Congress (or whatever you have where you live) to pass a law saying copyright only restricts corporations, I'll pay you some amount relative to the number of human beings subject to that law.

I can either rewrite the function to take a char* parameter as an output buffer, or I can keep the function

[23:10:52] <austincheney> vdamewood, sorry, I am all over the place.  I am trying to keep myself distracted before I give this big techfest presentation at work
[23:12:54] <austincheney> vdamewood, you are right, 2^4096 has twice the digits of 2^2048
[23:15:09] <vdamewood> You will find that if the digits in base 10 are less than 316227766016838, you get 2n-1 digits, and greater than that gets 2n digits.
[23:15:37] <vdamewood> This pattern will break down when that 8 at the end becomes significant, and we find out that I rounded it from 79 and yet more digits.
[23:16:45] <vdamewood> So for example, if the base 10 representation is one digit, and that digit is 3 or less, you get 2n-1 digits, and if its' 4 or more you get 2n digits.
[23:17:05] <vdamewood> With two digit numbers, if less than 31 you get 2n-1 digits, if greater 2n digits.
[23:17:30] <vdamewood> With three digits, less than 316 is 2n-1 digits, and greater is 2n digits.
[23:17:33] <vdamewood> And so on.
[23:18:47] <vdamewood> So 2, gets you 2n-1 digits, 4, gets you 2n digits. 8->2n, 16->2n-1, 32->2n, 64->2n, 128->2n-1, 256->2n-1, 512->2n.
