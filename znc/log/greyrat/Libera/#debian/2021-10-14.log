[00:31:14] <topoi> I recently have some quite long delay with systemd resp. raising network interfaces, meanwhile except of "lo" I don't have anything specified in /etc/network/interfaces. Is there some other place which causes systemd to wait for network connections?
[00:32:30] <topoi> Is it because of /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ ? Does systemd check all the connections there listed first?
[00:32:36] <sney> topoi: if you have connman installed, it is known to cause weird problems with networking even if it isn't explicitly being used

[00:33:04] <sney> systemd-networkd has some functions that are not enabled by default in debian, so that's unlikely to be the culprit unless you started setting it up and forgot.
[00:33:37] <sney> network-manager, however, is used by default in the big 3 desktop environments, and will also usually try to manage anything not configured in /etc/network/interfaces,

[03:28:45] <farkaan> I'm having a bit of trouble booting debian after a dualboot netinstall. Grub keeps throwing me the command-line whenever I boot. I've tried reinstalling grub multiple times but it keeps happening. It hasn't booted on its own even once though I can manually boot into debian from the grub commandline and it works fine.
[03:29:16] <abrotman> which command line?
[03:29:37] <farkaan> The grub rescue mode thing. The "grub>" prompt.
[03:30:49] *** Joins: dvs (~hibbard@2607:f2c0:950b:5b00:e6a7:a0ff:fe31:ddf0)
[03:32:05] <farkaan> I can boot manually into debian from there by going root=(hd0,gpt5), linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda5 and initrd /initrd.img. But it never boots on its own and always throws me the commandline instead.
[03:34:13] <jmcnaught> farkaan: have you run "update-grub" (as root) after booting into Debian like this?
[03:34:49] <farkaan> jmcnaught: Oh believe me, I've done everything. I've installed and updated it like 5 times at this point. Both from inside Debian and from outside with a liveusb

[03:36:18] <PMT> that sounds like a matter of a config file not being where grub is looking for it, IMO.
[03:36:38] <farkaan> It says it found windows and installed successfully each time

[03:44:56] <farkaan> It didn't work
[03:45:33] <PMT> what didn't?
[03:46:15] <farkaan> Recreating the grub configuration like archwiki suggested
[03:46:41] <PMT> Did you put it in the same place?
[03:47:27] <farkaan> Yeah, it said the exact same things about finding the linux image, initrd image, windows, etc. Same result. It never shows any error during installation or updating
[03:47:42] <PMT> I'm not surprised it did not cause a different outcome.
[03:48:02] <PMT> Does it print anything before displaying the prompt, or above the prompt when it initially displays?

[03:49:26] <PMT> Maybe try manually triggering loading the configfile again once you're in the prompt and see if it prints something useful?

[03:52:56] <farkaan> Yeah I'm thinking it has something to do with  /etc/default/grub
[03:53:27] <PMT> I'd suggest trying to get it to tell you what the error is rather than guessing what's wrong.

[03:54:58] <farkaan> Yeah. Since it says everything went fine during grub-install and update-grub, I doubt there's a problem there. The issue is that the 'error' (if there's any at all) isn't very visible at this point.
[03:55:27] <PMT> which is why i'm telling you to try manually loading the config again in the prompt and seeing if it errors more readably.
[03:55:53] <farkaan> Oh yeah that might be a good idea

[10:56:31] <Afroboy> @somiaj i'm using laptop installed Debian 11 with mate from non free iso, and there is only one user mine.
[10:57:16] <somiaj> Many desktops (mate included) when loging in from a display manager don't source profile
[10:57:29] <somiaj> I would personally just put this in your user $HOME/.bashrc since you are using interactive shells
[10:58:06] <somiaj> since you only have one user, best to get in the habit of using user configuration files vs system to setup the enviorment how you want it for your user

[10:59:47] <Afroboy> @somiaj thanks for the answer, but when i used to use CentOS with mate desktop it didn't happen.
[11:00:22] <Afroboy> so i thought maybe is not related to desktops.
[11:00:40] <somiaj> What is exactly sourced when a user logs in can vary a bit between distros, also what version of centos (Unsure if systemd + logind has changed this any way)
[11:02:05] <Afroboy> Centos 7 + mate.
[11:02:21] <somiaj> hmm, might just be a difference between the rhel world and debian world then
[11:02:43] <Afroboy> yep exactly.
[11:02:45] <somiaj> personally I would just get use to use .bashrc for user settings for your shell, this works across distros if using bash
[11:03:22] <Afroboy> yeah, using zsh for now so i guess i will change it.
[11:03:26] <somiaj> (note it may vary if your login shells source .bashrc, but if you check ~/.profile you'll see .bashrc is sourced in debian) to make login shells similar to interactive shells
[11:03:36] <somiaj> yea, with zsh you'll have to adjust to its configuration file
[11:04:08] <somiaj> Afroboy: note you can see that this is due to how the display manager runs, just run 'su - username' in a terminal, and notice that with a login shell, does it work?

[11:07:05] <alkisg> somiaj: yes
[11:07:24] <somiaj> Afroboy: hmm, okay maybe what I thought isn't the case then, I just know that some display managers may not source the profile stuff.

[11:09:37] <alkisg> somiaj: ah got it, I have to use an older 4.19 kernel because 5.10 causes disk data corruption on this box; so 4.19 doesn't have exfat inside it, while the userland tools do not use the fuse one because they expect the kernel to manage it
[11:10:27] <somiaj> Afroboy: looking /etc/profile, bottom line, it looks like it should be sourcing everything in /etc/profile.d/*.sh, so could it be zsh isn't reading /etc/profile on login shells?
[11:10:50] <somiaj> alkisg: ahh, well try using exfat-fuse as the filesystem
[11:11:17] <alkisg> Yeah I need to manually mount it from the command line using exfat-fuse, then it works. Thanks!
[11:11:17] <somiaj> Afroboy: though again depends on how badily you want to debug this, vs just use the zsh configuration file in $HOME (which is my suggestion for this type of thing)
[11:11:24] <PMT> alkisg: 5.10 does what now
[11:12:44] <alkisg> PMT, yeah it's unfortunate and incredible. I haven't pinpointed the exact issue, but I can reliably reproduce it by e.g. running mksquashfs / target.squashfs; the target always is corrupted with 5.10. Even transmitting big data over the network gets corrupted
[11:13:10] <PMT> that sounds rather like an urgent bug report
[11:13:16] <alkisg> I don't have time to try to pinpoint it currently so for the last couple of months we've been using 4.19 on that box
[11:13:38] <Afroboy> @somiaj this problem persist in either bash or zsh.
[11:13:40] <alkisg> Indeed, but it would be very rude to report it and then say "sorry I have no time to test what you're asking me to"

[11:20:23] <Khepra> alkisg: I'l try that, thanks. I wonder, looking at it, if the corruption is merely a natural consequence of bind-mounting a live rw filesystem onto a source for a supposedly static squashfs
[11:20:32] <alkisg> With a minimal research I've read about realtek network modules corrupting the RAM; it may or it may not be related; but in that box, I do have realtek NIC
[11:20:40] <Khepra> you know, stuff changes mid-write non-atomically

[11:21:18] <Khepra> alkisg: so you're saying bind is not important? the mksquashfs is the only constant?
[11:21:19] <Afroboy> ans still doesn't export TESTVAR when i login again
[11:21:22] <alkisg> Khepra: we're using mksquashfs in ltsp for 10+ years, that's why we noticed it, we don't have any issue with that command in any other box or kernel or distro in 1000+ schools
[11:21:35] <Khepra> okay I'll try a few variants
[11:21:52] <somiaj> Afroboy: and by login you mean on a tty or via 'su - username' (I do know not all Xsessions source /etc/profile)
[11:21:54] <Khepra> I'd be surprised if there was a bug in squashfs, as that's the cornerstone of snaps
[11:22:19] <Afroboy> @somiaj yes that i mean
[11:22:35] <alkisg> Khepra: thanks; I don't know if you have a realtek NIC, but if you do, try to use it a bit while the copy is happening, it may (or may not) play a role in the issue
[11:22:44] <Afroboy> @somiaj 'su - username'
[11:22:50] <somiaj> Afroboy: anyways, if an actual login(1) isn't source /etc/profile.d/*.sh, I'm unsure what could be going on. You haven't modified /etc/profile and see it sourcing all those files at the bottom?
[11:23:12] <somiaj> my source with bash worked just fine here, and I suspect zsh should be reading /etc/profile with a login
[11:23:23] <Khepra> alkisg: I do, RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller
[11:23:34] <alkisg> Khepra: no I don't think the issue is in mksquashfs, I've seen it even while sending a big file over the network with nc and md5sum'ing it
[11:23:49] <alkisg> Khepra: great, please tell me of your results
[11:24:12] <Khepra> well I'm 100% sure the NIC itself doesn't corrupt anything here. I have ECC and ZFS on disks and these two would notice something funny
[11:24:34] <somiaj> Afroboy: I did find a post that 'zsh's syntax is not completely compatible with that of Bourne/POSIX, so by default, it doesn't read /etc/profile' -- maybe that is what is going on?

[11:26:06] <Khepra> alkisg: I always verify ISOs via checksum files; and indeed, data corrupted in the NIC would come in corrupted into the ECC RAM and csumed ZFS, but I'm sure I'd notice broken downloaded stuff
[11:26:15] <somiaj> that I don't know what could be going on, since my tests show it working. So no clue why bash wouldn't be sourcing it with login shells in a default debian 11 install.

[11:41:20] <alkisg> If the problem is in the realtek nic drivers, I doubt a VM would be affected, due to the NIC emulation involved

[18:43:17] <jelly> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[18:43:18] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.
[18:44:02] <jelly> dob1, it doesn't matter too much what kinds of command syntax exists, if you're doing a release upgrade just do what the release notes say
[18:44:05] <n4dir> https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/mips64el/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html#minimal-upgrade
[18:44:05] <sney> as for your other question, the release notes say "In some cases, doing the full upgrade (as described below) directly might remove large numbers of packages that you will want to keep" - basically, it's saying that if you run 'apt full-upgrade' and apt wants to remove a lot of stuff you're using, you can use the --without-new-pkgs option to take it a step at a time.
[18:44:23] <sney> it won't be necessary in most cases.
[18:44:29] <n4dir> that seems to explain the need/wish to first apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
[18:44:43] <n4dir> ops. sney just said it.
[18:45:03] *** Joins: sinaowolabi (~SinaOwola@169.159.107.158)
[18:45:08] <sney> it's best to read the instructions in the release notes, and not just the code blocks.
[18:45:43] <n4dir> never thought much about the why, i was told to, i always did apt-get update; apt-get upgrade; apt-get dist-upgrade. The reasoning is similar?
[18:47:02] <sney> yes, I think the release notes instructions are being extra careful here
[18:47:29] <dob1> imho it has to be always the same commands for relase ugprade, the commands have to adapt to the changes, just my opinion. now it's different from previous (and previous etc) ugprade
[18:47:31] <n4dir> though it sure has no (serious) drawbacks?
[18:47:34] <jelly> the exact instructions can vary slightly from release to release
[18:47:51] <jelly> it's not _always_ the same
[18:49:18] <jelly> this is why you're supposed to read the notes, instead of blindly doing the same thing as usual

[18:51:49] <sney> but fwiw I have not had any systems need the --without-new-pkgs option. just apt update, apt upgrade, apt full-upgrade

[18:52:45] <sney> that's because dpkg was updated before the release notes were written, when bullseye was still testing
[18:53:14] <sney> there's also a size limit to dpkg factoids

[18:57:55] <sney> it has more colorful output and it's fewer letters to type :) lots of people never switched from apt-get and that's fine too.
[18:59:03] <n4dir> sney: i think you also can install deb packages with it, including dependency resolution. And such things. Enhancements. I don't really know it, i hear from it now and then
[19:01:00] <PMT> You can convince apt or apt-get to install debs, I believe. Just give it a full path and go.
[19:01:29] <sney> yes, I do that with apt from time to time

[21:51:01] <redbrass> I saw similar types of kernel errors with my newer laptop (video card was too new for standard debian install).  Though I don't think I had the NX violation...
[21:51:41] <ttys000> redbrass i was thinking it might be that, this motherboard has an APU
[21:51:57] <ttys000> https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B550M-ITXac/index.asp
[21:52:00] <sney> it's a kernel panic, and there are lots of things that cause kernel panics, but that nx error really doesn't sound like a failure to load amdgpu
[21:52:18] <sney> it wouldn't hurt to try the firmware image but I don't think that's going to be it

[21:54:05] <Khepra> we don't know. I'd _start_ by testing it for holes
[21:54:59] <PMT> ttys000: we suspect bad _something physical_. Memory is one thing to test. If it comes back bad, you can try replacing the RAM. If the new RAM also comes back bad (or if all the sticks come back bad even when put in independently), then I'd start suspecting other hardware in the setup.
[21:55:12] <redbrass> Your image seems to suggest there are other errors above.  Finding the first error would be helpful.  Everything after that could be an artifact of that first error.
[21:55:55] <redbrass> I think trying to find that first error would be more helpful to you than replacing hardware as a guess...
[21:56:29] <redbrass> but, yeah, replacing the ram would be a good checkmark in the troubleshooting steps. :)

[22:59:04] <kittonian> and like i said, i can login sudo to root, and copy/paste the cron command I entered and it runs just fine

[23:06:33] <kittonian> right, but i don't need that. just wanted to be sure I wasn't missing something stupid

[23:19:41] <kittonian> if it does, pretty terrible that the system ignores the rest of the cron jobs just because of one line that didn't specify a user. why not just skip that one entry and show a syslog error?
[23:20:17] <kittonian> and maybe have a better error like (@reboot requires a user)

[23:35:37] <PMT> kittonian: what's that the error from?
[23:35:46] <greycat> Depends on what thing, but in many cases, a crontab with @reboot will suffice.
[23:35:51] <kittonian> it's from cron trying to run my script
[23:35:53] <jmd> PerfDave: Of the Operating System
[23:36:01] <jmd> (in it's normal run-level)
[23:36:18] <PMT> kittonian: it's almost certainly something inside of your script. I would suggest adding debugging prints to figure out what.
[23:36:20] <PerfDave> jmd: Probably an @reboot cronjob. I suggest the user's own crontab to avoid the kind of problems that kittonian seems to be having ;)

[23:38:00] <PMT> kittonian: well, if your script contains one program, and something is printing that it needs an interactive tty, it seems pretty obvious what it is, doesn't it.

[23:40:16] <kittonian> so how do I modify it so that it's not an issue?
[23:40:22] <greycat> I still can't tell whether "the input device is not a TTY" is an ERROR MESSAGE that is being quoted, or a RANDOM COMMENT from kittonian.
[23:40:36] <kittonian> greycat, it's from the syslog
[23:40:40] <kittonian> not a random comment
[23:40:40] <PMT> i have no idea. i have no docker experience. i am just telling you that it's an issue with the thing being run.
[23:40:53] <greycat> well, figure out what command wrote that error message

[23:46:00] <kittonian> PerfDave, I'm using docker-compose so that command doesn't work for me
[23:46:16] <kittonian> that's why I wrote the script because you have to be in the correct directory and then issue a docker-compose command
[23:47:03] <kittonian> and I just found something referring to adding a -t to the command to avoid this error, but running that from the command line doesn't work
[23:47:17] <PerfDave> kittonian: Hmm, I thought docker-compose was for spinning up stacks; can you not use "docker container exec" to run somethign in an already-created container?
[23:47:49] <kittonian> no, it says no such container
[23:48:02] <kittonian> but if you do docker-compose exec container it works
[23:48:48] <PerfDave> OK. I'm not familiar with docker-compose I'm afraid, you may want to try asking somewhere more Docker-specific
