[12:00:59] <Activ8> And I‚Äôm English John this means? Lol
[12:04:20] <johncs> haha uhhhh... so ways to parse languages like markdown, json, javascript, etc. is a pretty big area of research and general tomfoolery.
[12:04:58] <johncs> there's a lot of ways to implement a parser. many of these implemenations could be labeled by an overarching term
[12:05:09] <johncs> like how you can slot a lot of languages into functional or imperative or what have you
[12:05:15] <Activ8> what you mean you have no business doing this? it's open source you can do what you like
[12:05:22] <johncs> parser combinators are a particular type of parser
[12:05:31] <Activ8> you still talking double dutch
[12:05:33] <Activ8> lol
[12:05:33] <johncs> oh lawl, my bad, i assumed you were confused about the parser combinator bit
[12:06:01] <Activ8> "small parser combinator library to parse markdown" :D
[12:06:06] <Activ8> whooooooooosh
[12:06:19] <johncs> Oh I guess I see language parsing as a fairly sophisticated discipline and I see myself as, roughly, a small pig rolling around in the mud pits of code
[12:06:47] <Activ8> well the question is... will it make TL better?  If the answer is yes - go for it!
[12:06:47] <johncs> So I have no business implementing a parser combinator library cause I'm a newb. But that rarely stops me üòÜ

[22:14:50] <mavericks> Just wondering if it's ever come up, but has anyone investigated having a private instance that acts like a public one? ie, i can save networks to a specific connection, but when I close the browser tab, i disconnect. 
[22:15:00] <mavericks> i'd be willing to take a crack at implementation myself
[22:16:57] <mavericks> I basically want to use thelounge as  a traditional client -- but one that runs in the browser
[22:18:24] <mavericks> The two ideas I have for implementing this is to store what network connections a specific client is using in browser storage and run it in a "public" mode, or add a toggle to the private mode that disconnects when you disconnect
