[01:28:01] <Cl0udSanta> Killnine, for the UPS, figure out how much power you'll probably be using. if you dont have the systems already, you can use their spec sheets to get their estimates. and then with that info you can figure out the size of the UPS needed, in order to have enough time to nicely shut things down

[01:28:24] <Cl0udSanta> for the PDU, synaccess are nice tbh
[01:29:15] <Cl0udSanta> theres plenty of PDU options, but again, dont by a shitty one. and also never plug in more than 80% of the rated circuit capacity, so that you can account for usage spikes without blowing shit out
[01:29:54] <sd> 14<K​illnine> When estimating power do you go by the PSU size for servers? I don't have a killawatt handy for actually measuing
[01:30:17] <Cl0udSanta> usually systems will give a 'peak/average usage' wattage rating

[02:04:57] <Cl0udSanta> lol ok.. look. you have a physical system. it has idrac. neither idrac, nor the network are plugged in. you are physically in front of the system. IF the local access software for idrac was installed on said system, you can access information from idrac, on the local system, without being connected to idrac through a network connection, however, that software has to be installed
[02:05:01] <koollman> well, if the server is offline, you have to go near it. Might as well plug onto the idrac port ;)

[08:02:10] <Hunterkll> i'd like to see fuckin shit powered off of tool batteries 
[08:03:18] <PattyCakes> I'd like to see a day when battery shit finally replaces corded shit
[08:03:35] <Hunterkll> I can see a lot of places that'd never happen
[08:03:36] <PattyCakes> I have doubles of like half my tools, because sometimes you just need 15amps of pure AC power
[08:03:38] <Hunterkll> and am perfectly fine with it 
[08:03:50] <Hunterkll> yea, and they're using AC motors to get that extra ooomf 
[08:04:03] <PattyCakes> don'
[08:04:03] <Hunterkll> not brushless DC crap
[08:04:14] <PattyCakes> don't get me wrong, you can pry my red and yellow batteries from my cold dead hands
[08:04:14] <Hunterkll> even electric cars convert the battery power to AC to run the motors 
[08:04:28] <PattyCakes> They are useful 98% of the time
[08:04:39] <Hunterkll> oh for sure i have a fair amount
[08:04:52] <Hunterkll> but imagine a battery powered air compressor of any decent size (say 60 gal ) lol
[08:05:05] <Hunterkll> or battery powered table saw that isn't a midget

[08:05:26] <PattyCakes> no joke, half my tools come that way
[08:05:34] <Hunterkll> estate sales are awsome for shit like that
[08:06:09] <PattyCakes> takes a ton of effort though. Gotta find the sales that are marketed towards other crap, and a single line saying "oh and the shit in the garage"
[08:06:27] <PattyCakes> that's the GOLD for scoring
[08:06:37] <misspwn> as morbid as that is, those are goldmines and the families that sell them personally are relieved for you to take their shit
[08:07:06] <PattyCakes> when grandma died, we had a "it's on the curb, come get it" sale
[08:07:06] <misspwn> they have enough to deal with and i don't think many reasonable offers are declined
[08:07:14] <PattyCakes> aka posted everywhere with pictures of the shit pile
[08:07:20] <PattyCakes> what was left, trash men tool

[08:07:39] <zetorian> i got a halfway decent bandsaw from a 'shit on the curb sale'
[08:07:45] <misspwn> they can just burn my parents house, it's becoming a hoard
[08:07:51] <misspwn> i am not gona want to ever pick through that
[08:07:58] <PattyCakes> that was grandma
[08:08:03] <PattyCakes> I mean sure, it all held value to her
[08:08:07] <PattyCakes> but it was 40 years of shit
[08:08:20] <misspwn> there may be nice stuff hiding in there too, but that's an awful lot of time wasting
[08:08:24] <misspwn> pillaging through towers
[08:09:11] <zetorian> it's kinda awful, but you could probably just hand out buckets and charge by the pound.
[08:09:32] <zetorian> some idiot'll be willing to go through it
[08:09:42] <PattyCakes> not even worth that - if I wasn't living in the house, I'd have just posted an ad stating "come in, take whatever you want"
[08:10:00] <PattyCakes> maybe charge $10 to weed out the strange people
[08:10:13] <PattyCakes> *a chunk of the strange people
[08:10:43] <zetorian> oof, that's a rough house then.
[08:10:58] <Hunterkll> i mean, we used to buy junk storage spaces before those reality shows fuckin hit
[08:11:05] <Hunterkll> $10 for what looks like bags of clothes
[08:11:07] <PattyCakes> The attic was a nightmare, but luckily I got super lucky with that
[08:11:11] <Hunterkll> find like $600 in coins, a rifle or two, etc 
[08:11:16] <PattyCakes> when my garage ceiling caved in from water damage after the Texas freeze
[08:11:21] <PattyCakes> all the shit in the attic was relocated to the garage
[08:11:25] <PattyCakes> SUPER easy to clean up and get rid of
[08:11:47] <PattyCakes> and by relocated, I mean fell though the rafters onto the floor
[08:12:26] <PattyCakes> Grandpa was not the smartest of cookies - he just stacked shit in the attic space straight on the sheetrock
[08:12:46] <PattyCakes> nothing super heavy, but just a ton of volume. Water.+ extra weight of those = ceiling now floor

[09:11:16] <SirSantalot> So, I asked this question yesterday, but my timing was poor so it got swept away pretty quickly. Since Print Nightmare, is there still an accepted, non hacky way to let users add trusted printers (from print server) without admin creds?
[09:13:09] <SirSantalot> I'm seeing various things in various blog posts, but none seem too sure fire, like: "Just keep using Group Policy Preferences to deliver printers to those who need it. (Maybe. Will likely work.)"
[09:13:21] <csws> I think the only non hacky way is via third party stuff like papercut or the intune printing thingy
[09:13:40] <csws> but I heard the intune one is really expensive? like it's $/page
[09:14:09] <SirSantalot> per page? for a printer deployment? That sounds insane
[09:14:26] <csws> SirSantalot, the GPO method can't coexist with a theoretically secure setup, you have to screw with the registry to get driver installs going again
[09:14:44] <csws> and printing altogether stopped for us as we have 1709 still :(
[09:14:59] <csws> the patches break <1803
[09:15:16] <SirSantalot> yeah, stuff like that is why I'm asking here about a "best practice" method. I'm trying hard to clean my shit up and do stuff by the book, but it's hard to find the book about this at the moment :p
[09:15:41] <csws> Hunterkll had a lot to say about this at the time
[09:15:44] <csws> maybe he can be summoned
[09:16:06] <SirSantalot> Lol. "Best way?  Use Linux ;-)"    thanks, random spiceworks person
[09:16:15] <csws> holy crap
[09:17:00] <csws> probably some retarded 13 year old that reckons linux is the solution to everything
[09:17:07] <Hunterkll> bah
[09:17:15] <Hunterkll> configure point and print properly
[09:17:20] <Hunterkll> or mass deploy the drivers in advance
[09:17:22] <Hunterkll> done
[09:17:28] <SirSantalot> csws, I reckon he might, but I try to avoid pinging people directly to go to with my problems. Although there are people here who's knowledge I value greatly, I don't consider anyone here my personal troubleshooting resource
[09:17:41] <Hunterkll> if driver's already installed, no admin prompt requirement
[09:17:47] <csws> oh well there you go
[09:17:52] <csws> I think the 1709 issue scrambled my brains a bit
[09:17:59] <Hunterkll> if point and print is set up properly with your print server trusted & shit, you tweak it to let it use the old behavior via gpo 
[09:18:05] <csws> honestly hate this environment
[09:18:05] <Hunterkll> but only from trusted server
[09:18:21] <Hunterkll> like you should have configured it 25 years ago :P
[09:18:40] <SirSantalot> I don't even work here 25 years yet :p
[09:18:43] <SirSantalot> and besides
[09:19:09] <SirSantalot> I haven't become "concious" long enough to have everything configured correctly yet

[09:19:35] <Hunterkll> some of the shit isn't quite right but whatever
[09:20:06] <SirSantalot> so "tip 2" and "tip 3" there is what I should be following?
[09:20:25] <Hunterkll> tip 2 is give users full admin or enable the old probably still vulnerable vbehavior

[13:27:33] <Hunterkll> and by outward facing i mean like, the machine presents it for a remote desktop connection, or on a web page, or whatever
[13:27:36] <Hunterkll> not like internet-facing
[13:27:44] <sloth_on_meth> that;s the thing. lots of certs in weird applications noone's ever heard of. this is a hospital, by the way

[13:27:54] <Cl0udNinja> y
[13:27:59] <Hunterkll> there's so many certificates in a windows environment trying to shift through an in ventory of them would be insanity
[13:28:10] <Hunterkll> assuming you have an internal PKI setup at all
[13:28:17] <SirSantalot> Cl0udNinja, oh yeah lansweeper doesn't do that
[13:28:21] <Hunterkll> (and in that case, just co nsult the CA for a list of issued certificates...)
[13:28:40] <sloth_on_meth> hehe... they're all self signed
[13:28:50] <Hunterkll> yea, you'll find a lot of that too
[13:28:52] <Hunterkll> often by design
[13:29:24] <Hunterkll> ADFS - a microsoft provided service for identity federation - relies on one "externally signed" certificate - be it your CA or a public CA - and two self-signed certificates that get communicated in the federation metadata 
[13:29:44] <Hunterkll> so when you log into a 3rd party site that uses WS-Fed or even OAuth it's self-signed certs all the way down 
[13:29:46] <Hunterkll> :D

[13:35:40] <Activ8> Hi lancehead
[13:35:45] <Hunterkll> they get auto-regenerated ahead of time, with a staggered promotion time automated in the metadata/changeover to not invalidate old tokens, then eventually automatically retired

[13:38:50] <lancehead> SOOO what happened was 
[13:39:17] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, did you think they just carried their subs to the ocean over thousands of miles or something?? lol
[13:39:22] <lancehead> USBGuard turns off all USB ports by default, which would be fine except for the fact I didn't realize my RPI's usb, micro-ush and ethernet were all connected to an internal USB hub @ Activ8 
[13:39:27] <lancehead> Meaning I completely locked myself out lol 
[13:39:35] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: yea kinda like that scene where they're carrying the round down the ship in battleship

[14:01:16] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:01:49] <Cl0udNinja> the height/angles were all fucky, so I bought some desk mounts for the hotas and joystick, and immediately broke the glass on my table in the setup that I had, so I bought 2 monitor arms and a tv stand

[14:50:32] <teh_f4ll3n> guys, anyone know a FOSS case management system?
[14:50:54] <mjt> what type of case
[14:51:29] <Activ8> Why they under the sea at the start lol
[14:51:59] <teh_f4ll3n> just notes on what was done on a support session
[14:52:45] <teh_f4ll3n> basically, all I need is a customer record where I can add session date/time and notes 
[14:53:22] <mjt> when you said case I figured you meant law case 
[14:53:51] <mjt> But then I'm a lawyer so I would think that 
[14:54:05] <mjt> That's basically a CRM isnt it? Plenty of solutions out there. You could probably get away with a ticket system alternatively
[14:56:49] <mjt> https://suitecrm.com/
[14:56:55] <mjt> This maybe
[14:56:58] <teh_f4ll3n> well, we have a crm with ticket system included, it's just we need to create a separate ticket for each incident and it only shows 5 at a time, subjects only. I want something simpler that would just show me a wall of text when you click a customer
[14:57:40] <teh_f4ll3n> it's just awkward and the guys find it awkward to work
[14:58:03] <mjt> I see. It's a shame you can't have it all integrated into the one system.

[14:59:48] <Activ8> Your mum sucks donkey balls
[15:00:26] <teh_f4ll3n> I could probably get our devs to write a module for the existing CRM that just adds a button
[15:00:46] <mjt> everywhere I've worked has had an in house tool for task management, so I haven't had much exposure to off the shelf software.
[15:01:45] <mjt> teh_f4ll3n: sounds like a good idea tbh
[15:02:43] <mjt> another platform just makes for disparate data. You leave and some other dude gets assigned all your tickets, he can go and see all your internal notes which is probably a good thing
[15:03:31] <mjt> if you do a separate system at least make sure you link up some unique identifier to associate it with the record in the CRM so down the line you can match them up if you want to go for a unified solution
[15:03:55] <mjt> Rather than fuzzy match bullshit or god forbid manual data match ups
[15:04:39] <teh_f4ll3n> or maybe a form that just uses a webhook to post a note to the customer record. so then when you open notes and have all interactions there

[16:40:50] <DOMF> one AZ shouldn't affect so many things
[16:41:47] <mjt> DOMF: although, in my experience, single AZ failure is rare. I can't readily recall one. It's always been a whole region knocked off. And it's always been us-east-1.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
[23:21:23] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run.
