[00:17:56] <jonathon> jiriks74: when you say "booting other os", what do you mean? have you also tried booting an installer image (whether Arch or a more... fuller-featured live installation environment)? If no OS will boot then it sounds more like a hardware issue?
[00:18:38] <jiriks74> Well, we tried booting windows (hangs)
[00:18:47] <jiriks74> But the arch installation loads without any problem
[00:18:54] <jiriks74> The problem is when you start a gui
[00:18:55] <hstefan> Hi! I'm confused about how to get Grub to work with an encrypted root volume. Essentially when I boot nothing happens and then grub times out waiting for the device to come up. Looking at the config file it seems like grub has the correct uuid as "root" in the kernel line, but still I get no prompt for the passphrase and eventually the init gives
[00:18:55] <hstefan> up.
[00:19:00] *** Joins: icy_hot_ (~icy_hot@172.58.99.103)
[00:19:28] <Namarrgon> hstefan: is /boot encrypted too?
[00:19:41] <hstefan> Namarrgon nope
[00:20:02] <jiriks74> You can either do startx or enable sddm and the system will hang one the gui is (partially) loaded <jonathon>
[00:20:08] <Namarrgon> hstefan: then grub is not invovled in the decryption process
[00:20:29] <Namarrgon> hstefan: do you get dropped to the initramfs shell?
[00:20:36] <hstefan> yep
[00:20:44] <Namarrgon> can you unlock and mount your /-fs from there?
[00:21:17] <jonathon> jiriks74: it will be worth trying a live installer environment that includes a GUI (e.g. EndeavourOS) to check whether your GPU works; if Windows has an issue then it's unlikely to be a Linux-specific thing.

[00:21:49] <jiriks74> <jonathon> It does a bit, that's why I'd like to recover some logs either from xorg, kernel panic or sddm
[00:22:09] <jonathon> ok, so if you can access a TTY then look at the logs?
[00:22:24] <jiriks74> <Poirot12345T> Go on with <jonathon>'s idea
[00:22:35] <Poirot12345T> OK, gotcha
[00:23:12] <Poirot12345T> jonathon where am I supposed to find the logs? (Sorry, I'm new to installing Arch Linux, never dealt with this kind of problem)

[06:55:09] <mpan> rcf: what do you mean?
[06:55:51] <rcf> mpan: systemd is clearly designed to be incapable of promptly terminating user processes and hanging at attempted reboots. 
[06:55:53] <mpan> captain_morgan: in particular, are any processes finally killed after waiting, according to the log? If yes, which?
[06:56:13] <mpan> rcf: yes, hence I ask for the log. It should give the processes, which were nuked.
[06:56:31] <lolok> is there some way to lower this limit for all services
[06:56:32] <lolok> ?
[06:56:46] <rcf> captain_morgan: for typical users, reducing every timeout as much as possible is the solution. 
[06:57:01] <mpan> lolok: timeout? Yes, but it would be a better idea to first determine what is the cause.
[06:57:58] *** Joins: rickybob (rickybob@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/rickybob)
[06:58:01] <lolok> i done this for a few already, probably wouldnt eliminate it, but lower it quite a bit as no services i have running should take more than 30 sec to exit

[07:00:24] <lolok> truth thx
[07:00:31] <mpan> … instead of understanding, what causes the issue.
[07:01:00] <lolok> you mean waiting an extra 5 mins to understand
[07:01:49] <mpan> 90s is not 5 mins.
[07:02:01] <mpan> It stays in your previous boot’s logs too.

[07:06:06] <mpan> rcf: but before killing you may try to debug.
[07:06:27] <lolok> you start debug shell before every shutdown?
[07:06:49] <lolok> might have to script that tbh

I suspect that may be the case here.
[07:25:57] <captain_morgan> display manager is SDDM
[07:26:11] <mpan> captain_morgan: in which case you should follow what rcf has suggested AND report that as a bug.
[07:26:15] <captain_morgan> but it appears it is exiting before this hangup
[07:26:46] <Nitrousoxide> Does anyone here use the SE kernel and if so is it stable on Arch? I understand that it is not an officially supported kernel so I want to be careful before taking the plunge.

[07:28:52] <rcf> mpan: unless GNOME is at fault, in which case... they are literally the reason that upstream defaults to KillUserProcess=yes as a default. 
[07:29:01] <captain_morgan> yeah, I'm booting up my old desktop to see what it had KillUserProcesses set to
[07:29:02] <rcf> It is the permanent solution!

If I want to help them add a second router, bridged wireless only, is it important that the second router be the same brand/model as the first?
[09:09:53] <demonicmaniac> for brdige/wisp mode it doesn't matter
[09:10:12] <demonicmaniac> but honestly - mesh routers are a thing now. just replace the old stuff with mesh capable routers
[09:10:19] <demonicmaniac> preferably 3band
[09:10:23] <captain_morgan> I started settting up meshing on OpenWRT but found 802.11r Fast Transition worked well enough
[09:10:56] <demonicmaniac> you still want triband for seperate inter router communication though

[09:13:58] <rcf> h4rd3n3D_: that tends to be the most reliable way to go about it, and if it's older that's actually not too difficult to do usually. However I should be clear that the mode which works well is wireless to ethernet bridging; doing everything wireless can incur a significant penalty due to the overlap of the collision domain that gets worse with older equipment because fewer channels. 
[09:15:01] <rcf> Mesh is more sensible because it's actually designed to do this.

[14:34:44] <tsdh> I have some CIFS auto-mounts in my /etc/fstab.  Since recently it happens that some mount breaks in the sense that trying to access /my/mount/point/some_file.txt will block indefinitely.  Same for trying to umount it.  Is there any hammer to try to restart the mount without restarting the complete system?

[18:16:20] <falk689> Hi, I'm trying to configure a Nextcloud server on a fully updated archlinux machine running Nginx and MariaDB following the ArchWiki https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nextcloud, I completed all the steps and the server is accessible from the web but when I try to login I get redirected to the login page indefinetly without error messages or logs in the log file. I'm seriously at a loss since I feel like I tried everything, even using 
[18:16:20] <falk689> Postgresql instead of MariaDB since the support doesn't seem optimal. Does somebody have an idea about what can I do to actually have at least an error to work with?
[18:17:28] *** Joins: chuangzhu (~chuangzhu@user/chuangzhu)
[18:18:05] <falk689> It's probably some major noob error on my side but it's like the login page just redirects to itself instead of landing wherever it should? No internal server errors no nginx warnings, nothing.

[20:53:58] <CubeTheThird> I doubt that's any fault of your own ;P
