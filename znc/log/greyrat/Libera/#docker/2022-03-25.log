[01:40:36] <larsks> Aavar: '--restart always' tells the container to restart whenever it exits. This includes starting a boot, but also if it exits with an error, or if it exists with no error, etc.

[01:51:19] <Aavar> I have done that and it is not some command found online (that being said I disagree, but that is besides the point). I still think I am missing something and there is nothing wrong with the command. Anyway, thsnk you for your help :)
[01:52:19] <njka> heh
[01:52:35] <njka> ok bro
[01:53:00] <njka> "--restart always" is absolutely your problem whether or not you choose to agree
[01:54:41] <Aavar> njka: I just told you I removed that from the command and it stoped the container after a few seconds. It did not keep the container running (as is logical from larsks comment).
[01:55:21] <Aavar> I believe there is something missing from the command (or the file), not something wrong. I just cant figure out what.
[01:55:39] <programmerq> when you start a container, you're launching a process. when that process exits, the container is considered stopped. your containerized process may have a misconfiguration, or an error of some sort, etc...
[01:56:15] <programmerq> you can check the logs of the stopped container and look at the exit code. 'docker logs <container>' and 'docker ps -a'
[01:56:53] <njka> Aavar: you originally asked why your container kept restarting... i told you why... whatever you're talking about now is a different problem than the original one you asked about
[01:57:53] <Aavar> njka: ok.
[01:58:41] <Aavar> programmerq: As far as I can see it ran bash. How can I tell the container what command to run?

[06:19:32] <ada_> there's no web gui for `registry`
[06:19:46] <ada_> I would start by debugging the connection refused
[06:20:15] <ada_> if you are publishing a port, but you still get a connection refused, then I'd probably start looking at a tcp/ip stack reason for the failure
[06:20:31] <ada_> in this instance I'm betting iptables rules didn't get programmed to reach teh container

[06:31:43] <humanBird> heh i don't even have netstat installed
[06:32:26] <ada_> I don't think it comes installed by default much anymore, `ss` has superceded it but I don't know the syntax for `ss` to get what I want to see

[07:06:55] <lantech19446> someone tell me if i'm thinking straight here, if I wanted a really great backup for the website at my work I could build a docker image that installs httpd pulls from our repo and then restarts httpd with the right ports exposed and i'd have an almost instantly running backup
[07:06:56] *** Joins: SSLbits7 (~SSLbits@user/sslbits)
[07:11:09] <rawtaz> not sure why you would need to restart the httpd after pulling the files, but yes you can use a docker container for a web server, if thats what you mean
[07:20:31] <lantech19446> the restart is just for good measure
[07:20:54] <rawtaz> good measure is always good! but quite innecessary in this case probably
[07:21:23] <lantech19446> if i could do this it would be a really good backup because i finally have my boss in the habit of using github all i'd have to do is point dns to docker instead of the current server

[07:34:38] <lantech19446> yea i mean i don't have anything that "has" to be containerized but it's a cool technology and i want to know it so i'm just trying to figure my way through it and come up with real world stuff to try
[07:35:40] <rawtaz> one thing you could do is to use it for your software development stuff. instead of installing languages, tools and libraries for your code on your computer, run them in containers
[07:35:46] *** Quits: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious) (Quit: Leaving.)
[07:36:14] <rawtaz> that will give you an every day hands on experience with docker instead of just occasionally when you set some not relaly needed project up just for kicks
[07:37:48] <lantech19446> interesting idea and ubuntu has python installed already so i'd just have to get it to install vscode 
[07:38:33] <lantech19446> it might even make learning python more fun

[16:12:50] <PaulePanter> Hi. I found the Dockerfile https://github.com/dsb-lab/Docker-single-cell-analysis/commit/bd229a6216b5250b252848b58ba2fcb0f69694b0
[16:13:36] <PaulePanter> and it looks like they use versions of the image built from the same Dockerfile (but different) version as the base image. Sounds strange and incorrect?

[16:14:13] <PaulePanter> Image single_cell_analysis:0.2 is built from Dockerfile with `FROM dsblab/single_cell_analysis:0.1`.
[16:15:06] <PaulePanter> I guess they want to avoid changing the Python packages in anyway, but the idiomatic way, would be to name the image differently, wouldn’t it?
[16:15:24] <PaulePanter> Or is it a good usage pattern?

[16:27:39] <Anticom> PaulePanter: I don't know enough about python but I'd imagine they have some type of lock file as well? Usually those make sure that regardless of your semver specs of dependencies you get repeatable installs.
[16:27:58] *** Joins: vantage (~vantage@ip-193-121-152-141.dsl.scarlet.be)
[16:28:18] <Anticom> If that holds true you _should_ be able to run the docker build again and get the exact same result. And hence you wouldn't need to build a new version of an image based on the old version of that same image.

[16:30:47] <GyrosGeier> it would be cool if images were completely reproducible

[16:34:49] <PaulePanter> Anticom: The the example at hand is an antipattern?
[16:35:03] <Anticom> PaulePanter: not a qualified answer but I'd vote for yes
[16:35:10] <PaulePanter> Anticom: Thank you.
[16:35:47] <ikke> Anticom: pip does not use lock files
[16:35:56] <ikke> not sure about things like anaconda though
[16:35:58] <GyrosGeier> Anticom, "docker import"
[16:36:25] <GyrosGeier> several of my images are built from vendor tarballs
[16:36:39] <GyrosGeier> e.g. Intel's QuartusII installer comes as a tarball
[16:37:34] <Anticom> GyrosGeier: and why don't you do a `RUN wget path/to/archive/at/version.x.y.z.tgz` ?
[16:38:40] <Anticom> I thought you're only supposed to import archives using `docker import` that originate from a `docker export`, however not sure since I don't really use those features.

[17:10:21] <Anticom> GyrosGeier: or you could COPY it from your local FS after downloading it. If it's a time-limited archive you probably can't automate building the image anyway (except if you check in the downloaded archive)
[17:11:29] <GyrosGeier> "docker import" works fine
[17:11:36] <GyrosGeier> but gives me a new container ID every time
[17:11:48] <GyrosGeier> which means the cache gets invalidated
[17:11:55] <GyrosGeier> that is a bit annoying
[17:12:09] <GyrosGeier> I reuse the same file for import

[21:39:45] <spagoote> i'm starting to feel like a complete moron: how do I create the initial user for vaultwarden? because right now I have only managed to enable the admin page but I can't do it there, I can only invite via email...I don't need an smtp server for anything. IIRC there used to be a command you run to create the first user, has this changed?

[22:29:25] <programmerq> I don't know much about vaultwarden. is your question about how to run an smtp relay for a container? For development, I've used something like this in the past: https://github.com/maildev/maildev - it's a webmail gui that accepts all email and just puts it into the gui. you could run that as a separate container and access the invite email that way. all emails sent by your thing would end up
[22:29:28] <programmerq> there.
[22:29:35] *** Joins: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50::4a2c)
[22:29:57] <programmerq> otherwise, if your thing really does need to send an email, then you'd need to have a real smtp server (which could be the gmail smtp if you send it from a gmail account you control)
[22:31:19] <acovrig> I have a few bitwarden (same as vaultwarden?) containers running that I pointed to my own SMTP server or sendgrid (couldn't get gmail to accept auth). I don't remember how I got my first user setup lol

[22:53:54] <acovrig> cuz multi-arch is fun - my arm64 can build an arm64+amd64 image in 3.5s given cache (3min 34s w/out cache), but my x86 system builds the same thing in 1hr 53min given a) no cache and b) compiling arm64 on x86 - most of the time I'm only changing the last layer, so ideally I'd be able to use the cache on the x86 system and skip building the other

[22:56:23] <acovrig> I'm guessing my issue is on the arm64 (apple m1) I am not running "buildx create --use", I'm just "buildx build"; on the x86 system, I'm having to use "buildx create" and it's a CICD env, so if cache isn't in the normal docker location, then it wouldn't be kept
