[04:20:07] <dsal> build times are only slow if you're using TH.  You could always hand-write your lenses.
[04:20:25] <jollygood2> basically, instead of person personName (groupLeader group) we can use group.leader.name . and different records can also have .name etc fields
[04:20:33] <jollygood2> pretty neat

[14:17:53] <stengah> >>=
[14:18:06] <stengah> is like a continuation 
[14:18:23] <stengah> is there anything wrong with this thinking?
[14:18:45] <dminuoso> stengah: For the specific IO instance that seems like one possible approach.
[14:19:05] <Franciman> stengah: I also like to think about it as «effectful let»
[14:19:13] <dminuoso> stengah: The thing is, Monad doesnt have an instrinsitic meaning where you can phrase: (>>=) is <insert something>
[14:19:13] <Franciman> it binds a variable to the result of an effectufl operation
[14:19:23] <Franciman> it's like you did:

[14:20:15] <dminuoso> stengah: For IO this is a rough (inaccurate) description, but it should work as an initial step.
[14:20:38] <stengah> ok
[14:20:46] <dminuoso> stengah: The key thing to realize is that Monad is just a typeclass/interface, so >>= means different things for different instances.
[14:20:52] <dminuoso> But that's perfectly okay
[14:21:05] <dminuoso> stengah: So let me rephrase your statement a little bit:
[14:21:14] <dminuoso> >>= for IO is (sort of) like a continuation
[14:21:21] <dminuoso> The key addition is "for IO"

[14:21:56] <dminuoso> Go with that mind model until you encounter a different instance. At that point, you can gain some intution what >>= means for that type.
[14:22:08] <kuribas> there's a interesting link between monads and continations.
[14:22:16] <dminuoso> Yeah which is probably not helpful.
[14:22:40] <kuribas> well, a monad is not a continuation, if that is what you mean.
[14:22:42] <dminuoso> stengah: And you repeat that process, and without extra effort you will overtime begin to understand what monad abstracts over.

[14:22:54] <kuribas> but they are likely equally powerful.

[14:26:47] <dminuoso> stengah: My key realization was, when something is written polymorphically over monad - that its its type signature mentions something like `Monad m => ...`, it just means *you* get to pick some arbitrary m as long as it has an instance Monad. So you can pick `m ~ IO`, for instance.

[14:37:57] <dminuoso> This gets close
[14:38:09] <dminuoso> So as long as you use a dedicated monomorphized operator variant of bindIO and thenIO...
[14:38:47] <lortabac> nice, but I have to say it's less readable than do notation
[14:39:03] <dminuoso> Which could be a good motivation to introduce do-notation later on.
[14:39:15] <lortabac> yes
[14:39:40] <dminuoso> And actually, you can use do-notation with RebindableSyntax.
[14:39:41] <dminuoso> :p
[14:39:56] <lortabac> also (not useful for beginners) IO itself is exposed in GHC.Types

[15:07:51] <unit73e> xmonad is more configurable
[15:07:56] <merijn> I mean
[15:08:05] <merijn> The real insight is that xmonad isn't a window manager
[15:08:16] <merijn> It's a library/DSL for writing custom window managers :p

[15:10:16] <unit73e> both are sort of wrong but I think you get the point
[15:10:21] <dminuoso> The C core is essentially a buffer framework, but emacs comes with plenty of elisp making it an editor out of the box.
[15:11:03] <unit73e> it was this guy here: https://yi-editor.github.io/

[15:12:15] <unit73e> hum, it looked like a nice project
[15:12:25] <geekosaur> mostly because everyone who tries wants to turn it into a full-fledged IDE instead of just an editor. it's already pretty usable just as an editor

[15:13:06] <unit73e> of being an "IDE"
[15:13:07] <dminuoso> lortabac: My favourite was using `D { ..., someRef = unsafePerformIO (newIORef Nothing) }` inside a traversal. Turns out that GHC let-floated this ioref out, aliasing some hundred thousand IORefs in a tree to a single shared mutable buffer.
[15:13:15] <dminuoso> It looked so innocent...
[15:13:17] <geekosaur> sure, but HLS onlyt sprang into existence a year ago
[15:13:49] <unit73e> right. well yi just has to support that. language server is one of the few things microsoft did right lol
[15:15:02] <unit73e> vscode is kind of cheesy though
[15:15:16] <unit73e> it's okayish but kind of quirky
[15:15:45] <unit73e> I just use neovim

[19:10:12] <monochrom> I don't find it disappointing.

[19:13:08] <maerwald> but given the ecosystem support, it's easier to just give in
[19:14:17] <monochrom> No. Writing >>= by hand for even String -> Maybe (String, a) gets old pretty quickly.
[19:14:55] <maerwald> it's our way to emulate OOP, because we want to hide the state object parameter
[19:15:00] <monochrom> And the code really cries "I am a transformed monad".

[19:54:29] *** Joins: hyiltiz (~quassel@31.220.5.250)
[19:54:38] <monochrom> Recognizing that it is a certain composition of StateT and [], and using that knowledge to connect the <*> and <|> of State with the <*> and <|> of [], is better, and useful to know.
[19:54:46] <gentauro> I only used monads if I need to `take some decision` on the `outputted` value. Example: `fooBar >>= \ foo -> if foo then …`. Otherwise I opt for `<$>` or `_ <$> … <*>`
[19:54:50] <monochrom> err
[19:54:59] <maerwald> I dunno, maybe we'll figure out a better way to express effects/computations one day
[19:55:12] <monochrom> using that knowledge to connect the <*> and <|> of String -> [(a, String)] to those of State and [].
[19:55:19] <gentauro> maerwald: I like monadic effects
[19:55:20] <maerwald> especially in light of combining them
[19:55:37] <monochrom> There will always be better ways in the future.
[19:55:52] <maerwald> and there I agree that algebraic effects seem saner, but also more intellectual complexity (polysemy and friends)
[19:56:04] <maerwald> to the point that no one really understands semantics anymore either
[19:56:31] <monochrom> For here and now, StateT String [] is the best known fit to my use case.
[19:56:33] <maerwald> I haven't made up my mind about verbosity
[19:56:52] <maerwald> I'm fine with verbose languages like rust and python... but damn they make my fingers hurt
[19:57:32] <monochrom> Indeed StateT String [] is less remotely-abstract than all the more advanced theories. Given that you are against remotely-abstract as a principle.
[19:58:48] <monochrom> StateT String [] is sufficiently concrete and sufficiently elegant for its purpose.

[20:00:32] <maerwald> while... once you got used to verbose code (and there are a couple of rules everyone follows), then reading verbose code can be very efficient
[20:00:55] <maerwald> (like not introducing new variables in the middle of a C function)
[20:01:10] <monochrom> I do that all the time. Bite me.
[20:01:49] <monochrom> I can be talked into "if you do that, add { } around its real scope" though.
[20:02:24] <monochrom> But I will refuse "there are only two levels, top and function". Because there aren't.
[20:02:26] <maerwald> ok, I'm off buying soap (need to clean myself after this conversation)
[20:02:28] <maerwald> :D
[20:03:02] <monochrom> There is nothing wrong with "for (int i = ...) { int s = 0; ... }"
[20:03:14] <maerwald> I think I'd allow that exception
[20:03:32] <maerwald> also, in rust it's a bit harder to follow this rule
[20:03:53] <maerwald> because of all the shenanigans you have to do to trick the borrow checker into thinking your code is safe
[20:04:34] <monochrom> The only thing you can complain about is if I have "x = 0; int y; ...", it is a bit harder to spot the introduction of y, and it's also a bit harder to spot the end of relevance of y.
[20:05:14] <monochrom> For the former, I have blank lines already. For the latter, that's why I offer "x = 0; { int y; ... } ..."
[20:05:34] <monochrom> That rule is stupid.
[20:06:02] <monochrom> I can take everything you said and say it about that rule, too.

[23:18:00] *** Joins: evocatus (~evocatus@84.51.113.13)
[23:19:14] <geekosaur> you'd start on a platform with a working ghc and use that to build a dev compiler that supports -funregisterised, then use that to build ghc again with -funregisterised, then collect the output sources and take them to the target machine
[23:19:20] <geekosaur> it's a royal pain

[23:20:11] <geekosaur> a newer way if LLVM is supported is compile with -fllvm -keep-llvm-files (I think that's the option) and run llc/opt/lld on the target
[23:20:37] <xerox> that seems nice
[23:20:40] <geekosaur> basically ghc is really not friendly to this kind of thing currently
[23:20:54] <geekosaur> there's supposedly some work going on to improve things a bit

[23:22:33] <geekosaur> but this general issue is a problem with any self-hosted compiler. I think you have to dig up some ancient gcc that could be built with non-gcc (1.40?) to bootstrap a current one from scratch

[23:50:07] <sshine> I'm trying to add a package to stackage, but I'm told that sqlite-simple isn't found: https://gist.github.com/sshine/d3a715326791746eb20d7bc857f4686e -- it's kinda strange, because if I look up that package, it does appear to be in nightly-2021-06-14 and in lts-18.13. but apparently not in nightly-2021-10-19. I wonder how I find out why.

[23:51:50] <juri_> Hecate: you win.
[23:52:46] <sshine> ha, I was going to demonstrate that at least you can prove that anything plus NaN is NaN, but you can't, because it isn't equal to itself.

[23:53:33] <sshine> and saying it isn't equal to NaN is about as trivial as saying it isn't equal to anything else.
