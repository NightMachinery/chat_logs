[06:58:49] <MaxLeiter> general thoughts https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/ac22677ff3eed0ed/settings-tabbed.webm?
[07:04:19] <MaxLeiter> I cant decide if status messages are appearance or messages and media

[07:24:28] <xnaas> I'm probably a weirdo, but I think the settings don't need much more pagination than general and advanced or something
[07:24:44] <xnaas> advanced being all the horrible things some of us power users keep wanting ;P
[07:26:55] <xnaas> Pagination might also prove a bit annoying on mobile, idk
[07:44:13] <xnaas> note: I'm not a UX guy, so
[07:44:14] <xnaas> :P
[07:45:38] <johncs> i think pagination like this comes with some cons
[07:45:55] <johncs> the icons aren't as descriptive as the textual headings already in there
[07:46:46] <johncs> there's also not such a huge amount of settings that scrolling through them feels painful currently
[07:47:17] <MaxLeiter> Its more about organization, imo
[07:49:14] <MaxLeiter> and I got rid of the advanced settings
[07:49:27] <MaxLeiter> "whats classified is advanced" isn't well defined
[07:49:31] <MaxLeiter> as*
[07:50:00] <johncs> what do you mean it's more about organization? do you mean your main intent is to reorganize the settings under different headings?
[07:50:20] <MaxLeiter> we've turned down a lot of features becaue we don't want to clutter the settings page 
[07:50:53] <MaxLeiter> and rn its take (in my opinion) too much mental energy to find what you want if you don't know what it is
[07:52:19] <johncs> i think pagination would help feel the settings page feel less cluttered, but i would also expect it to take more mental energy to find what you're looking for
[07:52:41] <johncs> since you can no longer quickly scroll up and down, but instead you'd be visiting several boxes trying to get a feel for what's included in each box
[07:54:21] <xnaas> searchable settings seems like the solution to all problems ;P
[07:55:27] <johncs> I was also under the impression that the clutter to the settings page wasn't the thing we're trying to avoid, but rather we're trying to avoid the overall complexity of having many settings. I thought it was more about "The Lounge is opinionated".
[07:55:31] <MaxLeiter> It still doesn't help if you aren't entirely sure what you're looking for ("twelve hour", "24" won't work, it's "12-hour")
[07:55:55] <xnaas> add tags to every settings :wesmart:
[07:56:17] <johncs> Haha I'm not sure there's enough settings for search to help a ton üòÖ, but it might feel alright. Especially if there was some explainer help text associated with each setting.
[07:56:26] <MaxLeiter> johncs: I think we've tried but that's also not well defined 
[07:56:49] <johncs> explainer text associated with each setting?
[07:56:59] <MaxLeiter> er, what we allow and don't
[07:57:25] * xnaas 's opinion is that xpaw isn't the decision maker anymore, do what makes you happy
[07:57:26] <xnaas> ;P
[07:57:41] <johncs> ah i see, for sure. i wouldn't expect what features and work we accept to be particularly well-defined anyways.
[07:58:09] <MaxLeiter> I think being conservative is good for the project, not just xpaws wishes d: 
[07:59:31] <xnaas> üòú
[08:12:25] <MaxLeiter> but this does open up the possibilities of things like keyboard shortcuts
