[00:22:55] <Jmtrix> i mean, is this a legit question?
[00:23:50] <Jmtrix> x1 decreases in the interval [0, t_f], but ||u_1|| <= 1, so \dot{x_1} is definitely > 0
[00:24:07] <Jmtrix> there's a typo somewhere in the question, perhaps?

[00:36:12] <Z-module> em, once you have a metric (call it rho) on some space X, you can talk about rho being complete by just refering to Cauchy sequences and convergence.  It doesn't use reals except in the usual way that the rho values are all real (and >= 0).

[00:39:05] <Z-module> hi mh_le ... I just submerged myself in seawater for the first time in 2021. It was *painfully* cold... could only stay in about 3 minutes.

[11:03:50] <kakuhen> it's different but it's also a bit nicer for analysis.
[11:04:09] <kakuhen> if you compare the def'n of a limit on C versus plain old R^2 then you'll see what i mean

[11:32:09] <brbblnch> I'm a bit confused about the following: if you take the standard Lorentzian bilinear form on R^{n+1}, you can define hyperbolic space as the upper sheet of the hyperboloid

[14:42:29] <OverCoder> ok so
[14:42:35] <OverCoder> e^x = cos(x) + isin(x)
[14:42:39] <OverCoder> what's e^(-x)?
[14:42:56] <OverCoder> google images is not helping
[14:42:56] <int-e> well the first one is false
[14:43:02] <OverCoder> wot
[14:43:23] <OverCoder> er meant e^(ix)
[14:43:54] <int-e> right; you can substitute ix for x in that to get an expression for e^-x
[14:44:12] <int-e> though to what end, I don't know
[14:44:27] <OverCoder> er I also correspondingly meant e^(-ix)
[14:44:34] <OverCoder> in other words euler's formula but with a minus in there
[14:44:46] <OverCoder> I'm curious if there's some special equation or something
[14:44:49] <int-e> then you'd substitute -x for x
[14:44:57] <OverCoder> O
[14:45:16] <int-e> you can also compute 1/(cos(x) + isin(x)) but that is more effort
[14:45:18] <OverCoder> in this case it'd be e^(-ix) = cos(x) - isin(x)
[14:45:24] <OverCoder> right?
[14:45:27] <int-e> yes

[23:14:41] <Batzy> what is a rigit subset?
[23:14:46] <Batzy> rigid*
[23:15:26] <Batzy> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_analytic_space i guess it's this
[23:16:37] <Batzy> baguvix sorry ive been busy
[23:16:45] <Batzy> baguvix did you get it?
[23:17:48] <Batzy> "oh, so it's like `(0.20 * 2) + (0.20 * 3) ...` and such, right?" -- this isn't right
[23:19:03] <Batzy> 0.2 * 2 would be like the expected number of planes that are late from a selection of 2 planes
