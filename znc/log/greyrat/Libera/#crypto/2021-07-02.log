[02:49:53] <jbis> How do most TRNGs generate random numbers?
[02:50:10] <mouseghost> might be with some real world effects
[02:50:27] <jbis> Wiki says
[02:50:28] <jbis> > Such devices are often based on microscopic phenomena that generate low-level, statistically random "noise" signals, such as thermal noise, the photoelectric effect, involving a beam splitter, and other quantum phenomen
[02:50:50] <jbis> Which isn't very specific
[02:51:21] <Peng> I think Intel has written some details about how their CPU TRNG supposedly works.
[02:51:22] <mouseghost> jbis, they said "thermal noise, p-e effect, and other quantum phenomena"
[02:51:30] <mouseghost> thats kinda specific
[02:51:40] <mouseghost> also cloudflare used lava lamps to generate random numbers iirc
[02:51:46] <mouseghost> or still uses
[02:52:01] <piou> nah, that was a communication stunt, they were never used in production
[02:52:04] <Peng> Yeah. I think they have a couple different designs, too.
[02:52:11] <piou> they could, but they weren't
[02:52:22] <Peng> IIRC they used it for something (if mostly as a stunt)

[04:02:09] <MacGyver> It's not just "This is AES. This is how AES works." etc.
[04:02:17] <mouseghost> ah ah i see
[04:02:26] <mouseghost> thats interesting, then
[04:03:23] <ms7821> serious crypto's decent
[04:04:51] <onelegend> sometimes I still wonder if AES 512 will be a thing. I know it's "not needed", but I don't see much wrong in drafting some paper related to large AES key sizes. 
[04:05:39] <onelegend> other than "not needed", what's another argument? Is it weaker in terms of cryptanalysis?
[04:06:07] <ms7821> I wonder if the resources should link to the latacora right answer page
[04:06:26] <MacGyver> onelegend: I don't think Rijndael was ever developed for key- or block-sizes > 256 bits.
[04:06:36] <piou> Something I really liked in Applied Cryptography that didn't make it into many other books is a huge section on different protocols in the line of "I want a system where anyone can encrypt data but it needs 4 specific people to decrypt and any 2 person to verify" etc... Lots of really interesting ideas, many of which never found an application to my knowledge
[04:06:38] <MacGyver> onelegend: So that would require more than simply selecting a larger key size for the standard.
[04:07:06] <ms7821> piou, yeah I liked all the obscure but very limited purpose voting system stuff
[04:07:38] <ms7821> AC isn't linked, though, it's even older than HAC
[04:07:47] <MacGyver> onelegend: (AES is Rijndael with a limited set of key sizes and a single block size)
[04:08:31] <onelegend> I think someone made a 512 bit cipher based in Rijadael. https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/650.pdf
[04:08:39] <onelegend> Kalyna
[04:09:03] <piou> ms7821: HAC came out the year the 2nd edition of AC did if I read it correctly
[04:09:23] <onelegend> don't know about its security, but it did become the national encryption standard of ukraine
[04:09:27] <ms7821> ahh hmm older than I thought
[04:09:41] <piou> I think not putting AC on the list is a smart move, but it's still close to my heart
[04:10:13] <ms7821> could put Cryptography Engineering on there
[04:10:23] <MacGyver> ms7821: It is.
[04:10:29] <MacGyver> But CE is still from 2010.

[21:20:48] <Alipha> onelegend: triple AES with 3 256-bit keys would be 768-bit encryption. You'd be able to reduce it to 2^512 by using a meet in the middle attack with 2^256 storage
[21:21:45] <MacGyver> So even if you have several universes at your disposal, the lower limit achieved with TAES is 512 bits.
[21:21:49] <Alipha> Note that these are absurdly-huge numbers. We will never need more than 256-bit symmetric encryption
[21:22:02] <rqsd> /r/privacy would probably disagree
[21:22:12] <MacGyver> For very large meanings of "several".

[21:27:27] <ms7821> the NSA does many things, some are worth mitigating
[21:27:50] <rqsd> If you have an all-powerful attacker in your model, you can fold immediately. If you have an attacker bound to mostly what the academic general consensus is, you've just got a normal passive MITM just at a larger scale with better correlation abilities that you can guard against if it's an actual problem
[21:29:11] <MacGyver> rqsd: Well, apart from it being fair to classify the NSA as an active MITM, yes.
[21:29:16] <ms7821> they'll be running code on all your devices if they really want access anyway
[21:29:26] <onelegend> fortunately NSA computers are too weak to crack AES.

[21:30:14] <MacGyver> It's not unreasonable to put the NSA in your threat model. It's unreasonable to pretend they violate the laws of physics.
[21:30:38] <rqsd> You *generally* do not have a *real* NSA problem
[21:30:43] <MacGyver> We *know* there's a whole lot of other shit they pull that has nothing to do with "breaking 256-bit encryption".
[21:30:59] <rqsd> And if you do, cryptography *generally* works as expected
[21:31:15] <rqsd> Now other people in the chain, say, CloudFlare, are a completely different thing
[21:31:37] <rqsd> You don't need to break cryptography if you can just ask the largest CDNs to just MITM for you

[21:33:31] <onelegend> Let's Encrypt is the best CA tho

[21:36:22] <onelegend> unfortunately math just doesn't work that way
[21:36:35] <onelegend> even SMP requires a preshared key
[21:37:04] <MacGyver> onelegend: Don't worry, I'm sure somebody has a quantum key distributor to sell you.
[21:37:19] <onelegend> ah are those resistant to MITM?
[21:37:28] <MacGyver> Well *in theory*, yes.
[21:37:53] <MacGyver> Or at the very least they *detect* MITM, that won't necessarily allow you to establish a key while being MITM'd.

[21:38:06] <onelegend> oh

[21:43:03] <onelegend> *ha
[21:43:41] <onelegend> the only cipher that is unbreakable so far is OTP
[21:44:21] <MacGyver> Wellllllllll
[21:44:34] <ms7821> it only achieves that by considering key distribution out of scope
[21:44:38] <MacGyver> "unbreakable" isn't the term I'd use there.
[21:45:02] <MacGyver> It's "information-theoretically secure", for certain definitions of secure.
[21:45:17] <MacGyver> Also it's not the only construction that is that.
[21:45:25] <MacGyver> Shamir's Secret Sharing also has that distinction.
[21:45:33] <MacGyver> They also both break down on authenticity.
[21:46:00] <MacGyver> Turns out, information-theoretic security is *not* the property we're looking for.
[21:46:09] <onelegend> OTP is too slow
[21:46:21] <MacGyver> Au contraire, OTP is extremely fast.
[21:46:21] <onelegend> for a 4GB file, you'd need an 8 GB key
[21:46:26] <MacGyver> It's just an XOR.
[21:46:29] <onelegend> oh
[21:46:30] <MacGyver> Can't get simpler than that.
[21:46:34] <onelegend> but the keys are too large no>
[21:46:43] <MacGyver> Well you have to read the file right?
[21:46:52] *** Quits: Brnocrist (~spartak@user/brnocrist) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[21:47:10] <MacGyver> Also needing an 8GiB key implies you're not talking about OTP, you're also including universal hashing to fix authenticity.
[21:49:37] <MacGyver> Point I'm making is, things may seem to work great on paper, but once exposed to the real world, you may find your assumptions were missing certain things that turn out to be *very* important after all.
[21:49:54] <MacGyver> Information-theoretic security is great! But it doesn't fix anything.
[21:52:07] <MacGyver> Now *IF* quantum key distribution can be made to work perfectly, you could *in theory* use it to distribute a truly randomly generated key long enough to do a one-time pad with universal hashing to achieve information-theoretic security and authenticity on a message sent between two parties.
[21:52:23] <MacGyver> The problem is that practice is proving that a very, very, *extremely* hard if.
[21:53:01] <MacGyver> Which is kinda why we tend to be more interested in post-quantum cryptography, to achieve "normal" security in the face of quantum computing; at least that seems to be something we *can* do.
[21:54:14] <rqsd> We can't even achieve normal security in the face of normal computers and systems built by people

[23:11:17] <jbis> I'm on 1.8. I'm pretty sure I know the solution, but it doesn't seem to be working. The challenge is to Detect AES in ECB mode. My idea is to go through each line, split into 16 byte chunks and then count the repetitions. However, I am not detecting any repetitions.
[23:13:23] <sarnold> what are the parameters of the problem? are you given a ciphertext with no further information? are you allowed to supply a plaintext that's encrypted by something else?
[23:13:37] <jbis> https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/8
[23:14:05] <jbis>  In this file are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.
[23:14:05] <jbis> One of them has been encrypted with ECB.
[23:14:05] <jbis> Detect it.

[23:18:38] <sarnold> so, I like the sound of your approach. have you constructed some test cases that you can use with your program to make sure that it works?
[23:19:17] <jbis> oh i'm an idiot
[23:19:20] <Bostik> for starters, you can't assume there are duplicate 16-byte blocks

[23:24:26] <Bostik> well okay, given the context you probably can (or even have to)
[23:24:44] <jbis> So I was selecting 8 bytes instead of 16 bytes
[23:24:48] <jbis> ...somehow
[23:25:38] <Bostik> if they are hex-encoded, you could read the text in 32-byte chunks and count those; no need to convert to the 16-byte octets really
[23:25:41] <sarnold> jbis: I did wonder about that, but if you were working with eg 16 characters instead of 16 'bytes', you should still see some duplicates..

[23:26:40] <jbis> Not sure if it's confusing for others, but I find thinking about ascii vs hex vs bytes vs bits and everything confusing 
[23:27:13] <yawkat> just practice

[23:29:58] <jbis> https://gist.github.com/jbis9051/031c2933101dc6992aff8ae6bf3a7f82
[23:30:07] <jbis> so why does bs need to be 32 here instead of 16
[23:30:52] <jbis> thats probably off topic, more go help
[23:31:02] <Bostik> in hex encoding, each byte (8 bits) is split into two 4-bit pieces, and those pieces are then printed out as hex values
[23:31:26] <Bostik> with four bits, you get values from 0 to 15, or  0..f
[23:31:54] <Bostik> does that help?
