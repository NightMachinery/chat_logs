[22:58:26] <DoubleBackSlash> Hey guys, someone here that has also a bit knowledge in JS and regex? Found something that really has no answer out there
[23:00:10] <VectorX> !rehelp @ DoubleBackSlash
[23:01:11] <DoubleBackSlash> Well from some reason custom functions in MongoDB are being written inside backticks: ``, Now I have a function inside this function which contains this regex: 
[23:01:20] <DoubleBackSlash> const escapeRegExp = (string) => string.replace(/[-.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")
[23:01:51] <DoubleBackSlash> Problem is, when inside the backticks I can't figure out how to escape the ${} to be treated as template literals

[23:08:54] <DoubleBackSlash> Anyone available for some crack?
[23:09:57] <VectorX> can you not put a \ before the $
[23:11:01] <nitro_> an if statement scanning for the string `${ with an alternative replace ?
[23:12:16] <DoubleBackSlash> Tried the backslash, didn't help unfortunately 
[23:14:15] <VectorX> DoubleBackSlash can you try three ie \\\$
[23:16:15] <DoubleBackSlash> Same
[23:16:43] <DoubleBackSlash> Well that might be a clue that \ and \\\ fix the error itself but still, the regex doesn’t work
[23:21:45] <rewt> what do you mean by "doesn't work"?  what happens if you change the replacement text temporarily to something obvious (eg "__REPLACEMENT__") instead of "\\$&"?
[23:22:45] <rewt> i'm guessing you may need some more \ in that replacement part, for the same reason you need it in the regex part
[23:24:45] <DoubleBackSlash> The error occurs only in ${} since this is the template literal syntax in JS and the whole function is a template literal. I need somehow to treat this ${} as regex and not template literal

[23:39:07] <silverdust> Hi there, I have the following regex https://regex101.com/r/tiRotp/1/ to capture CSS selector names. For element selectors that are not at the start of the line, a space is included. I want to capture them without the space in front of them. Any ideas?
[23:39:59] <rewt> maybe it's a JS issue... how is that supposed to work exactly?  looks like escapeRegExp is called with the allowedSymbols string, and it runs the replace on those characters, so only the * would get escaped (since that's the only thing in that string and in the regex)
[23:40:23] <rewt> DoubleBackSlash ^
[23:41:10] <DoubleBackSlash> The string is a function parameter so for example:
[23:42:01] <DoubleBackSlash> for this string: !dj49B it should return that a special character has been spotted as well as lowercase and uppercase
[23:42:05] <DoubleBackSlash> and number
[23:42:31] <DoubleBackSlash> but it returns only number, lowercase and uppercase. without detecting the special character
[23:43:14] <rewt> line 55 calls escapeRegExp(allowedSymbols), where allowedSymbols is by default "!@#$%^&*"
[23:43:38] <rewt> doesn't that mean `const escapeRegExp = (string) => string.replace(/[-.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&');` will run the regex on THAT string instead of the password string?
[23:44:03] <DoubleBackSlash> Yes, first the script gets a specific password string, then if it contains one of those special characters so this function runs
[23:44:34] <DoubleBackSlash> So basically "string" is being replaced by a password string
[23:46:48] <rewt> isn't "string" replaced by the string parameter, allowedSymbols?
[23:46:49] <DoubleBackSlash> https://github.com/deanilvincent/check-password-strength
[23:47:00] <DoubleBackSlash> this is the library
[23:48:26] <DoubleBackSlash> I think so, but only to flag it
[23:50:33] <rewt> oh, you changed it... JS has regex: `[${escapeRegExp(allowedSymbols)}]`, but your mongo version has regex: [escapeRegExp(allowedSymbols)],
[23:50:38] <rewt> you changed it from a string to an array
[23:53:14] *** Quits: re (~user@user/re) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:53:33] <DoubleBackSlash> Yeah since in the Mongo function the entire function is inside a backticks
[23:54:31] <rewt> well, you can't just change it from a string to an array and expect it to work the same...
[23:54:43] <DoubleBackSlash> I have just checked now and seems actually really weird and the string is being replaced by the allowedSymbols regardless what the string contains
[23:55:37] <silverdust> I think I figured out the solution to my problem https://regex101.com/r/hTAclT/1/
[23:55:47] <DoubleBackSlash> I did not, it still the same since in JS ${} opens a template literal and in the mongo function the entire code is template literal
[23:55:57] <DoubleBackSlash> so no need to declare ${} again
[23:56:19] <rewt> to have it without the backticks, it would have to be something like: regex: '['+escapeRegExp(allowedSymbols)+']',
[23:57:05] <rewt> you did though,  regex: [escapeRegExp(allowedSymbols)]  makes the value of the regex key an array containing a single string that's the return value of the function
[23:57:23] <rewt> the original interpolated the return value of the function into the string, so the value of the regex key was a single string
[23:57:39] <DoubleBackSlash> Ok will try it now
[23:58:24] <rewt> you can't just blindly say "ok, the outer thing does this, so the inner thing doesn't need it, so i'll remove SOME characters to make it look nice and hope it works"
[23:58:30] *** Joins: re (~user@user/re)
[23:58:41] <DoubleBackSlash> Awesome !
[23:58:58] <rewt> when changing something, you need to understand what it is doing that you're removing, and keep the same functionality
[23:59:52] <DoubleBackSlash> Thanks bro, great help
