[04:00:05] <bjs> sonny: well imperative algorithms are.

[04:05:14] <ProfSimm> bjs: the hope is that enough static constraints can be derived before the program has to actually run. We can pre-run it, by reducing (folding) expressions which are constant before runtime (like typing foo = 5 * 5 folds to 25)
[04:05:21] <sonny> seq2seqbot what was it?

[04:06:14] <[itchyjunk]> no, what's the light, sonny ?
[04:06:14] <ProfSimm> [itchyjunk]: because you end up with the same old same old: no type system can express all your requirements
[04:06:17] <bjs> ProfSimm: the classic JITy example of a JS function `function add(x, y) { return x+y }` where you gain some massive benefit from runtime analysis,  just doesn't exist for Haskell because the type system is so strong you know for sure what types things can be that you don't need runtime analysis to figure it out

[04:08:08] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: as usual there's a lot of tradeoffs. Statically enforced type systems always restrict the programs you can write, and impose a burden on the programmer to write down all the types and ensure their program is always valid.

[04:12:56] <[itchyjunk]> i dont see why i would want Maybe 5
[04:12:58] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the real power comes when you realise this allows you not just to overapproximate a function ("it returns a list of ints") but to *exactly* specify the behaviour of a function

[04:16:30] <[itchyjunk]> if so, i would think that's improbable
[04:16:33] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: right,  it's easy to see that this is basically impossible with Haskell-y types because your type can never talk about the actual list.

[04:18:54] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: roughly like `(y == <some math meaning reverse of x>) => {x: [a]} -> {y: [a]}`  (this isn't usually how you'd write dependent types, see something like Agda)

[04:20:22] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: and then your type checker would have to prove that the function actually reversed the list. Obviously totally unconstrained dependent types is undecidable,  so you have lots of research on "how much exactly can we get away with?" e.g. refinement types (liquid haskell) and agda (termination checkers) etc
[04:20:42] <sonny> bjs is this actually useful?
[04:20:53] <bjs> sonny: define useful? and to whom?
[04:21:04] <sonny> some type systems can let you have sets of types, that seems easier

[04:22:03] <[itchyjunk]> proving software may sound like research today
[04:22:03] <bjs> In extremis, no the fully undecidable version isn't useful.  But you can restrict it down to get something like refinement types and then you can add (some) critical properties into your type.  Not quite a proof-of-correctness but something along the way

[04:23:22] <bjs> sonny: yes un-discriminated unions, but they're a pain to program with in static type systems, that's why languages like Haskell have discriminated unions (`data` declarations) which you can pattern match on

[04:25:40] <PlanckWalk> Smart contracts are mostly lol
[04:25:44] <sonny> what is a smart contract?
[04:25:54] <[itchyjunk]> smart contracts have a programming language
[04:26:00] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: smart contracts are using the same words but are an unrelated but broad idea
[04:26:06] <[itchyjunk]> so it's resonable to think if they don't have type system, they will some day
[04:26:27] <Decker> it's got builtin triggers so when you satisfy conditions other things ahppen - you can setup an escrow for a house so when you finish paying it releases the title 
[04:26:31] <bjs> you might be thinking of like blockchain-y languages that fall under the "smart contract" umbrella
[04:26:35] <Decker> (for example)
[04:26:39] <PlanckWalk> Smart contracts have nothing to do with design contracts (except that they could *really use* design contracts!)
[04:26:43] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[04:26:52] <sonny> imagine contracts like, this variable cannot be aliased. it would be incredible
[04:26:56] <[itchyjunk]> i am thinking of blockchain-y languages tat let to write smart contracts
[04:26:59] <Decker> things like taxes can also be smart trigger - any deposit automatically poritions out a tax amount
[04:27:25] <[itchyjunk]> Decker, yes but does that type of a language have a type system?
[04:27:27] <PlanckWalk> Programming languages essentially enforce contracts, but the contracts they enforce are fixed at language design time.
[04:27:35] <[itchyjunk]> like money has a type Money or something?
[04:27:39] <Decker> ethereum is a C variant - with 256bit chars
[04:27:46] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: you can go read up on the actual languages used, i guess starting somewhere like https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/
[04:27:47] <bayaz> Title: Smart contract languages | ethereum.org 
[04:27:57] <PlanckWalk> Strongly typed languages allow you to specify some additional really anemic design contracts.
[04:28:01] <bjs> I don't really know much about these languages, I just assume they're fairly standard 
[04:28:20] <Decker> it runs in a VM so it's only allowed to do certain things
[04:28:32] <[itchyjunk]> "More precisely, we focus on Solidity, the most widely used programming language in Ethereum's ecosystem, and its type system, that is integrated in the language so to let the compiler statically enforce basic safety properties of smart contracts."
[04:28:41] <[itchyjunk]> okay, smart contract languages can have type systems
[04:28:43] <nomagno> C doesn't have variants
[04:28:53] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: sure, any language can have a type system
[04:28:54] <[itchyjunk]> now we need blockchain with smart contracts that are dependently typed
[04:28:59] <PlanckWalk> C has nothing but variants.
[04:29:16] <nomagno> well, it has no data structure called variant
[04:29:22] <PlanckWalk> Ah true
[04:29:47] <[itchyjunk]> "The formalization includes a static type system that represents the foundation of the Solidity compiler. We show that it prevents some errors
[04:29:48] <[itchyjunk]> whereas many others, such as accesses to a non existing function or state
[04:29:48] <[itchyjunk]> variable, are only detected at runtime and cause interruption and rollingback of transactions"
[04:29:51] <nomagno> What does 'variant' mean in this contextM
[04:29:52] <[itchyjunk]> https://fc19.ifca.ai/wtsc/SoliditySolid.pdf
[04:29:53] <bayaz> Type: application/pdf 
[04:30:09] <[itchyjunk]> so looks like smart contract language have a need for stytacilaly typed language
[04:30:46] <Decker> it means 'like C' but not
[04:30:56] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: interestingly the same dynamic v static argument applies to proof vs test :)
[04:31:05] <PlanckWalk> With real design contract enforcement you could specify things like "no matter what happens in this implementation, I don't want to end up with no money and no house title"
[04:31:08] <Decker> like GLSL
[04:31:21] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: as proving things is hard, and most people don't really care if their stuff is actually correct 
[04:31:31] <bjs> it's much easier and quicker to just "get it out the door"
[04:31:34] <PlanckWalk> And in principle the compiler could throw errors in the code that implements it saying that there is some section of code where it can't prove that.
[04:31:51] <[itchyjunk]> i had asked about this and been disappointed, that if you could have formal proof for legal contracts

[04:59:40] <apotheon> re: 18:18 < koo5_> why, you could prove stuff about code without writing the code differently
[05:01:04] <apotheon> For code to be formally provable with a pre-designed proof system as meeting design requirements, you need a limited set of of conditions addressed by your proof system, and you need to write your code to strictly fit within that limited set of conditions.

[06:44:11] <sonny> An OS implementation might be much easier than I previously thought. First step is to find a reasonable architecture it seems
[06:44:15] <[itchyjunk]> OS is code too

[06:51:15] <Guest49> InPhase: I wanted to make sure my order is correct
[06:51:19] <[itchyjunk]> rom contains the instruction.
[06:51:19] <Decker> nor is it an OS
[06:51:27] <[itchyjunk]> No one claimed it is an OS.

[06:51:40] <[itchyjunk]> Again, notice the original quesiton.
[06:51:51] <Decker> I'm trying to get you to say which part of the OS is actually relavent for running code on a CPU
[06:51:54] <[itchyjunk]> None of what you say address your claim that OS is not an abstraction to the CPU.
[06:52:04] <Decker> it's not
[06:52:08] <[itchyjunk]> the kernel interfaces with the hardware.
[06:52:10] <FloridaMan> Damn a lot turns into an argument with this dude
[06:52:13] <[itchyjunk]> so you are abstracting it.
[06:52:18] <Decker> no
[06:52:22] <InPhase> Guest49: Well those can go all sorts of different orders on different architectures.
[06:52:32] <[itchyjunk]> kernel doesn't interface with hardware?
[06:52:35] <Decker> the CPU is still the CPU regardless of the OS
[06:52:37] <[itchyjunk]> just cite it.
[06:52:40] <InPhase> Guest49: Languages can also choose a different order.
[06:52:45] <[itchyjunk]> no one said the cpu is not a cpu.
[06:52:45] <Guest49> InPhase: You are right and that is why I am having issues with it
[06:52:46] <Decker> sure it does - that's not the point.  COde still runs without an OS
[06:52:53] <[itchyjunk]> An abstraction doesn't turn a cpu into a non cpu.
[06:52:58] <Decker> and CPUs till function without an OS
[06:53:03] <InPhase> Guest49: So the question is not complete without a context.
[06:53:04] <Decker> and it doesn't abstract anything about The CPU
[06:53:12] <[itchyjunk]> Sure it does.
[06:53:30] <Guest49> InPhase: Thanks for letting me know because I have one other question I am struggling with
[06:53:36] <[itchyjunk]> "Hardware abstractions often allow programmers to write device-independent, high performance applications by providing standard operating system (OS) calls to hardware. ..."
[06:53:45] <Decker> hardware not ACPU
[06:53:57] <[itchyjunk]> a cpu is not hardware?
[06:54:00] <[itchyjunk]> amazing.
[06:54:05] <ejjfunky> I think someone forgets to mention BIOS (Basic Input/Ouput System) here.
[06:54:13] <koo5_> and lisp
[06:54:14] <sonny> well, I said chip for a reason
[06:54:15] <[itchyjunk]> okay, BIOS as well

[06:57:07] <InPhase> Guest49: That's the same question.  I'm quite confident that order is wrong in most architectures, because it doesn't make sense to put local variables first.  They arise inside the function.  But for the exact ordering you need to figure out what the specific context is for the question.

[06:58:45] <Guest49> https://bpa.st/CPFA
[06:58:45] <EdFletcher> Yeah the OS isn’t implementing a VM for each arch to do that, it’s just scheduling. They’re using the word “virtualizing” here in a broad sense, not the “virtual machine” sense

[15:40:31] <Stefan26> actually created contents, but our system doesn't know this because the third-party PUT-call doesn't tell... on the other hand this is a idempotent request so PUT looks more right than POST even with that violation?

But also I realized that what I need is a topological sort, because there is no total order.

[20:05:10] <Decker> pyzozord actually - google developers talk from many years ago said differently.  and that push actually ended up fastest - but I'm not sure that an array is guaranteed continuous in memory so I think it works more like a linked list of shorter array
[20:05:56] <Decker> and like comparing for( blah; blah< arr.length; blah ) that's just a single indirection really... so it's as efficient as storing that in a variable

[20:12:57] <pyzozord> the only problem with the boostrapping process is the fatal flaw of what happens if you loose the program that you used to compile itself

[20:13:32] <Stefan26> have you guys heard of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem ? (about the tendency for question-askers to ask about their attempted solution rather than ask about their root-problem,... eg. question-asker asks "Help me do X (to solve Y)" and the answerer is annoyed cause he wants to just hear "Help me solve Y")

[20:14:03] <deniska> pyzozord: in a recent vid he was putting support for \r escape in literal strings. So first he wrote something like `if next_char = 'r' { put 13 }` (obviously in a more forthy syntax)
[20:14:26] <deniska> pyzozord: then in the next step he rewrote it as `if next_char = 'r' { put '\r' }`
[20:14:33] <deniska> and it's like, woah
[20:15:03] <Decker> https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/lkgr/src/objects/js-array.tq  Looks like arrays are actually written in 'torque'?

[20:15:14] <deniska> like there's some magic knowledge in the compiler binary itself, which it propogates into the next builds of a compiler
[20:15:31] <deniska> because the source code doesn't mention anymore that \r is ascii 13
[20:15:42] <Stefan26> I've found a different side of that to be equally common (but not sure that has a name). e.g. I ask on some forum " I want to learn about X (some tool/method)" and typically get a like response "(I think you are trying to learn X to solve root problem Y) you should use Z (to solve Y)"  --though they don't say the parts in the paranthesis

[20:16:39] <Stefan26> I find that pretty annoying too... is that like "reverse-XY-problem"?
[20:16:52] <deniska> Stefan26: people who tend to help others on IRC are doing that for a long time, so when they see X, they immediately jump to the conclusion that you want Y, even if you actually want X
[20:16:53] <pyzozord> deniska: it's like inherited knoweledge from the previous compiler embedded in the dna of the new compiler :D
