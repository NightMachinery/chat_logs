(even just passwd/group), I'd end up getting "Login Incorrect".
[03:42:35] <vindicator> The password was blank the whole time for testing purposes.

[03:50:15] <vindicator> Hashes? But I already said the password was blank (intentionally/passwordless). I wouldn't be using... okay, now you have me intrigued. So I'd use the passwd command to chroot to the archiso profile folder I copied and it'll create passwd,shadow,group,gshadow?
[03:50:21] <kevr> an arch iso is just a squashed filesystem, it still uses a linux filesystem on the iso.
[03:51:08] <kevr> vindicator: those are missing as it is?
[03:51:30] <vindicator> And what of creating a comment/description for said created user? The same comment that caused the Login Incorrect (issue/bug?)?
[03:51:58] <vindicator> Of course, the archiso profile only contains the shadow file for root only.
[03:52:15] <vindicator> baseline profile that is. I hadn't bothered looking at the rel one.
[03:52:22] <kevr> vindicator: an iso is literally just a linux install squashed into a more volatile type of disk that unsquashes everytime you load it, and by default it's ROish.
[03:52:34] <kevr> before you squash it, you can just treat it the same as any other linux filesystem
[03:52:46] <vindicator> I know what it is and I was using the mkarchiso tool to generate it.
[03:53:09] <kevr> the point is that you can literally use all of the tools you use on your desktop to setup your iso root
[03:53:33] <kevr> there's nothing about the iso root that stops you from treating it like linux, because it is linux

[03:57:17] <kevr> vindicator: I was just trying to say, if you _can_, prefer to use tools rather than manually, it can save a lot of battling with some things. That's all. I do see now that https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archiso#Users_and_passwords literally does suggest doing it manually
[03:57:18] <phrik> Title: Archiso - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[03:57:50] <vindicator> When I came across mkarchiso, I was so pleased that it already made use of my local cache and that's the way I intended to go about it from here on out. No more neon, no more download 1GB bare arch, when I can just build it on my own system.
[03:58:24] <kevr> vindicator: here's the point i was trying to make, though. if you look at the archiso wiki article, it shows you how to setup the files in "archlive/airootfs/..."

[03:58:48] <vindicator> Yup. So I was wondering how I'd even use useradd to create a user/password in that profile folder.
[03:58:50] <kevr> You can use some of the already existing tools that allow you to point to a different root instead of literally writing those files 100% manually.
[03:58:53] <kevr> That's just what I prefer to do.

[16:50:49] <ignapk> it didn't worked either; anyway, for starters I want to disable the Nvidia card in the live usb environment, and how do I do that, iirc I need to pass some kernel cmdline parameters, but I don't know how to do that on iso

[17:44:41] <ascor> Hi. I've had issues with several USB devices misbehaving (read/8 [error -110] on shutdown, LEDS on keyboard no longer working, mouse stops working and won't wake up again, etc). My suspicion is that this has to do with usb.autosuspend so I wanted to recompile my kernel with usb.autosuspend_delay = -1 to disable autosuspend completely, however this gives me an "invalid config" when I makepkg -s. Can anyone confirm 
[17:44:41] <ascor> that this will not work or if I'm even on the right path? I've tried blacklisting (via udev rules) all detected USB-hubs, as well as my mouse and keyboard but it didn't seem to solve the problem.
[17:45:09] <NetSysFire> if all devices misbehave, are you sure its not the port or hub?

[17:45:31] <ascor> I have had no issues during its entire lifetime when I was using it under Windows
[17:45:32] <NetSysFire> you can try using a known-good liveiso of some sort and if it starts working, its the kernel
[17:45:49] <NetSysFire> and autosuspend should be handled by sysctl or similar i am fairly sure
[17:46:02] <NetSysFire> you dont need to recompile your kernel for that
[17:46:49] <ascor> I should note that the most troublesome hub is the one connected to the keyboard
[17:47:15] <Namarrgon> -110 often indicates ESD issues
[17:47:30] <ascor> The keyboard itself has never stopped working but like I said, if other devices start acting up, the leds won't update anymore
[17:47:35] <NetSysFire> what does ESD stand for?
[17:47:46] <NetSysFire> did you try using them without the hub so you can make sure its not the hub?
[17:48:52] <ascor> I could give that a try but the reason I have to use it at all is because I've got VR Gear connected and that's taking up all my motherboard USB 3.0's

[18:16:06] <Shapesniffer> Hi. I messed up my system somehow. My laptop ran out of battery. I attempted to use an underpowered USB charger. It didn't help. I use LUKS, uefi, grub. The initramfs starts, but it hangs at "Finished Coldplug All udev Devices." with "A start job is running for /dev/1321/root...". Eventually it fails but can't drop to a console because "Canno open
[18:16:06] <Shapesniffer> access to console, the root account is locked.". I made a USB arch live stick and booted it. But there, I cannot at all find the disk. As in, no /dev/sd* or maybe I think it should be /dev/nvme... something... I don't remember. In any case, blkid doesn't show it. No apparent errors in journalctl. I'm at a loss. Especially since the initramfs still
[18:16:07] <Shapesniffer> starts, meaning the disk is still alive.

[20:51:33] <Namarrgon> either from the firmware or from grub
[20:51:35] <lambda> in your firmware settings
[20:52:30] <kevr> LimeGolem: The reason that it boots into arch when UEFI is disabled is that you installed arch while UEFI was disabled, so it setup a boot partition and stuff like that on MBR
[20:52:34] <kevr> or GPT without EFI
[20:53:18] <kevr> when you enable uefi, you get efivars and the option to install with efi.
