[07:12:00] <nepoco36> There is a web radio (http://sk.cri.cn/hxfh.m3u8) that I sometimes save for kicks, but recently there are frequent 404 errors that provokes weird behavior from ffmpeg.
[07:12:02] <nepoco36> One of the worst recently is that ffmpeg shows `Enter command: <target>|all <time>|-1 <command>[ <argument>]` and uses 100% CPU. I looked it up online and the results say to bewware when running ffmpeg in a loop, but that's not what I'm doing.
[07:12:37] <nepoco36> Although perhaps `keepalive request failed for 'http://sk.cri.cn/hxfh/1643151538.ts?wsApp=HLS&wsMonitor=0' with error: 'Server returned 404 Not Found' when opening url, retrying with new connection` is somewhat equivalent a loop?
[07:13:50] <nepoco36> Another one recently is that ffmpeg started showing detailed TCP logs (printing HTTP headers in dark green) but I'm not sure why.
[07:14:00] <nepoco36> only once so far
[07:15:35] <nepoco36> Unrelated: The IRC logs at https://www.ffmpeg.org/contact.html  seem to stop at early 2020.

[12:17:30] <furq> if you try and use it on an older device that doesn't have vp9 decode then it won't work
[12:17:43] <furq> same as with vaapi or nvdec or whatever
[12:17:44] <galad> Pinchiukas: VP9 decoding in VideoToolbox has been added in macOS 11
[12:19:06] <Pinchiukas> I don't understand if it's a hardware or a software thing.
[12:19:06] <JEEB> Pinchiukas: they added in the API, we can't just add VT decoding for something that apple didn't add support for
[12:19:17] <furq> it's hardware
[12:19:21] <galad> but hardware only, I don't think they shipped a software decoder
[12:19:43] <furq> videotoolbox is their api to access decoders which might be hardware or software
[12:20:05] <furq> when you request a decoder it'll hwdec or fallback to swdec or just bail out
[12:20:33] <furq> i guess a 2015 macbook doesn't have hwdec anyway
[12:21:28] <Pinchiukas> Well for some codecs but not vp9 I guess.
[12:21:31] <furq> right
[12:22:29] <Pinchiukas> So for a new one ffmpeg wasn't doing hwdec (until now) even though hardware/videotoolbox did support it, correct?
[12:23:32] <furq> right
[12:23:53] <furq> and until fairly recently videotoolbox wouldn't do it even though the hardware supported it
[12:25:48] <Pinchiukas> Well sucks for me I guess. :)

[12:46:48] <aphysically> ffmpeg accepts github patches now so I can submit a patch to fix the documentation and either way it'll get fixed or someone who knows better will tell me what's actually going on :P
[12:48:42] <aphysically> (the ffmpeg has the units wrong for some options)
[12:49:31] <aphysically> it's actually extra confusing, because ffmpeg units for its srt URI options don't agree with upstream units for URI options because of ffmpeg convention for duration fields, and those are correctly marked and adjusted in the libsrt.c code, but some other fields are incorrectly marked
[12:49:45] <aphysically> (and not adjusted at all in the libsrt.c code)
[12:50:20] <aphysically> so you both can't copy srt options you see online *and* can't trust the ffmpeg documentation to figure out the translation
[12:50:40] <aphysically> I just worked backward through the libsrt.c code and the libsrt API
[12:52:54] <aphysically> for example, ffmpeg's "ffs" option directly sets the SRTO_FC in the API, but ffmpeg documentation states it has units of bytes even though SRTO_FC has units if # of packets

[12:53:15] *** Joins: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru)
[12:54:50] <aphysically> this misdocumentation is nasty because ffmpeg documentation also states rcvbuf cannot be greater than fss, and it lists the units of both of them in bytes

[18:33:45] <flughafen> lol ok
[18:33:47] <another|> it very much is
[18:33:47] <flughafen> let
[18:33:49] <flughafen> s try that
[18:36:06] <flughafen> [mp4 @ 0x1913ac0] truehd in MP4 support is experimental, add '-strict -2' if you want to use it.
[18:36:37] <BtbN> Might want to transcode that to aac, if you want the file to be widely compatible.
[18:36:55] <another|> Is there no spec for it?
[18:36:56] <BtbN> If the video is h264, you can leave that alone, and only add -c:a aac -b:a 196k or something like it
[18:37:00] <flughafen> sure.
[18:37:02] <flughafen> it's not
[18:37:32] <flughafen> It's a hevc 4k
[18:37:53] <flughafen> OH, I dont think plex supports truehd anyway
[18:38:11] <flughafen> how do I convert it then?
[18:38:28] <BtbN> exactly the way I just described.
[18:38:50] <flughafen> oh
[18:39:03] <flughafen> lol
[18:39:51] <flughafen> lol
[18:39:57] <flughafen> [mp4 @ 0x1f164c0] Could not find tag for codec hdmv_pgs_subtitle in stream #9, codec not currently supported in container
[18:40:20] <flughafen> I wonder how kodi supports pgs subtitles
[18:40:44] <BtbN> those are not gonna fit into mp4, and I don't think they can be reasonably transcoded
[18:42:17] <another|> hmm.. truehd in mp4 has spec and everything.
[18:43:43] <flughafen> well plex doesn't support pgs at all, but kodi does ,

[20:21:20] <JEEB> it's a place
[20:21:30] <JEEB> just grab that H.265 spec from ITU-T, it's free after all

[20:22:08] <quietvoid> there basically is a byte sequence of 5 times 0x00 before a 0x01
[20:22:15] <quietvoid> which trips my code
[20:22:35] <quietvoid> but ffprobe/ffmpeg doesn't warn in copying
[20:22:56] <JEEB> how about -c copy -bsf:v trace_headers?
[20:23:17] <JEEB> also I don't recall what sort of trailing bytes were OK in H.265
[20:25:01] <quietvoid> hm i'm not too sure how to decipher the trace
[20:25:22] <jkqxz> There can be arbitrarily many zero bytes before, between and after NAL units - see B.2.1.
[20:25:49] *** Joins: zmt00 (~zmt00@user/zmt00)
[20:25:50] <quietvoid> but shouldn't there be an emulation prevention 0x03 byte
[20:26:23] <jkqxz> Emulation prevention is only within NAL units.
[20:26:24] <quietvoid> maybe there is i'm not sure
[20:26:32] <quietvoid> ah
[20:26:55] <jkqxz> Since the whole point of it is to avoid the inside of a NAL unit looking like a start code.
