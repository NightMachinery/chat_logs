[15:02:10] <mdhughes> Why? They're just doing what you tell them, same as any language. Except dynamic will try to do something useful with whatever you give it.
[15:03:17] <sham1> Dynamic is only useful when the types are strong
[15:03:28] <sham1> Type coercion is just the worst
[15:04:23] <Franciman> mdhughes: because i can't do a refactoring
[15:04:23] *** Joins: jeko (~jeko@2a01:e0a:25f:d8f0:4cc9:4184:da45:6beb)
[15:04:33] <Franciman> and i am not good enough to write code that will never be modified
[15:04:58] <mdhughes> That's not true, either. Making strings, for instance, in a strong/static system is fucking nightmarish. In dynamic you send -description or -toString or whatever to each object, and it's nice. In very loose systems like JS, everything can be a string!
[15:05:24] <mdhughes> If you think you're bad at programming, using a system that makes you worse at programming isn't going to help.
[15:05:38] <Franciman> it's the complete opposite
[15:05:45] <mdhughes> Only learning discipline and thinking will make you better, and a computer program *can not* help you at that.
[15:06:06] <Franciman> changing an assumption in your code
[15:06:17] <Franciman> requires you to remember every place you used it
[15:06:24] <Franciman> and dynamically typed languages DO NOT help you
[15:06:31] <Franciman> so you introduce zillions of errors 
[15:06:45] <Franciman> now you may argue that well thought code doesn't require you to change assumptions
[15:06:49] <mdhughes> That's poor discipline, then.
[15:06:50] <Franciman> hence my statement: i can't properly code
[15:07:10] <Franciman> mdhughes: so you prefer going to russia walking instead of taking the train
[15:07:16] <Franciman> because it's only a matter of discipline
[15:07:22] <Franciman> and there is no need in being cast in a vagon
[15:07:24] <Franciman> for 10 hours
[15:08:31] <mdhughes> Like, if tomorrow I decide all points in my library should be records instead of 2-vectors, I still only need to change the constructors. I bet it'd take <2 hours to do, across 10-20,000 LOC.
[15:08:36] <sham1> With a strong and static typing discipline, the compiler has more opportunities to prove more properties about the program ahead of time
[15:08:46] <Franciman> this is true as well
[15:09:06] <mdhughes> LEARN to think. Learn to to use good discipline. And then you won't suck at programming.

[15:09:43] <mdhughes> Types won't ever catch anything above matching values in two places. They can't tell you how a thing is used. If your program logic is wrong, the types can't help yo.
[15:09:51] <Franciman> depends on the types
[15:10:03] <Franciman> types can help me get correct logic
[15:10:10] <Franciman> it's a way of designing
[15:10:19] <sham1> One can encode logic into the types. Indeed, type theory is enhanced logic
[15:10:19] <Franciman> also they allow defining strict interfaces that are checked by a machine
[15:10:28] <Franciman> not just by me
[15:10:32] <Franciman> so discipline discipline
[15:10:34] <Franciman> sure

[15:11:35] <Franciman> of different expressibility

[15:13:31] <Franciman> you say you don't need it,because you can think
[15:13:33] <Franciman> sure
[15:13:41] <Franciman> but i like being helped by types
[15:14:00] <Franciman> i define properties in types, or constraint things, so that i can compose software better
[15:14:11] <Franciman> than having a function that does 2000000 different things dependening of the input you give it
[15:14:12] <mdhughes> But it doesn't help you. It's what's holding you back, making you weak and stupid. Write tests, and think about your logic, and you'll never need that nonsense.
[15:14:46] <sham1> mdhughes: you do know that those things are orthogonal to typong
[15:14:47] <Franciman> you forgot and good luck when you realised you made the wrong abstractions
[15:15:03] <sham1> Typing
[15:15:05] <mdhughes> You don't need to switch in a method, if the object can respond to messages. That's why we have abstract classes, or messaging systems. I mostly make those as let-over-lambda objects.
[15:16:10] <sham1> The way the objects respond to messages and whether they respond to a given message define a type
[15:17:21] <mdhughes> sham1: That's not what the typing freaks think "types" are. They want everything specified so a compiler can check it.
[15:17:43] <mdhughes> But most messaging systems are entirely ad-hoc, you can just send anything to anything and see if it works.
[15:17:45] *** Quits: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.96.21) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:17:52] <Franciman> mdhughes: actually that's not what you think types are
[15:17:53] <sham1> Well who cares about what they think
[15:17:57] <sham1> They're mostly not mathematics
[15:18:05] <sham1> Nor logisticians
[15:19:11] <Franciman> allowing any object to accept any message
[15:19:20] <Franciman> is another good way of defining things
[15:19:29] <Franciman> but it makes for sloppy thinking
[15:19:49] <Franciman> because most messages would give you a response that means «this method doesn't make sense here»
[15:19:54] <Franciman> so you have to clutter your whole program
[15:20:01] <Franciman> with with checks
[15:20:21] <Franciman> and this makes writing software by composition harder. You can still decompose software in pieces ofc
[15:20:32] <Franciman> but it's harder to prove things work as intended, imho
[15:20:35] <Franciman> on large scale
[15:20:44] <Franciman> if you write an irc bot, i don't care about type systems
[15:21:06] <mdhughes> You don't. You just carry on as if things are going to work, because you have tests to prove they do. There's usually a -doesNotUnderstand message that intercepts failed messages, or you can just throw an exception and see who wants to catch it.
[15:21:14] <Franciman> sure
[15:21:18] <Franciman> tests cover 100% of use cases
[15:21:28] <Franciman> this is the most perfect utopy
[15:21:40] <Franciman> i hope you never write software for nuclear plants
[15:22:10] <mdhughes> Type systems are just automated tests that only catch 10% of possible edge cases, and then the type freaks quit making tests because they think it's the answer to everything.
[15:22:21] <Franciman> again
[15:22:26] <Franciman> this depends on the notion of type system
[15:22:32] <sham1> mdhughes: that's a strawman
[15:22:38] <Franciman> and i agree that too many types are too hard to deal with
[15:22:45] <Franciman> but most type freaks still write software
[15:22:47] <Franciman> and tests
[15:22:51] <sham1> I have not met a single "type freak" that doesn't test their logic
[15:23:05] <sham1> Tests and types are orthogonal
[15:23:07] <Franciman> but they don't test what happens if you pass integers instead of strings to your system
[15:23:09] <sham1> Are you actually dim
[15:23:16] <sham1> Are you actually stupid
[15:23:55] <Franciman> mdhughes: do you use object oriented programming?
[15:24:03] <Franciman> when you said objects receive messages
[15:24:08] <Franciman> i really like this idea ^^
[15:24:16] <Franciman> or is it a sort of mixed strategy
[15:24:19] <Franciman> not purely oop
[15:24:30] <sham1> Sounds like smalltalk
[15:24:43] <mdhughes> I've never seen significant unit tests in strongly typed programs. They assume the type system is good enough. Every horrible Ocaml or Swift program is like that.
[15:25:00] <Franciman> mdhughes: i think i know why
[15:25:02] <Franciman> nobody uses ocaml
[15:25:07] <Franciman> so you only read amateur software
[15:25:11] <Franciman> :)
[15:25:36] <mdhughes> I'm an Objective-C programmer at heart. Smalltalk was fun, but unusable in engineering. ObjC was fucking magical, a little dangerous if you did a lot with C, but the object layer was fun.
[15:25:52] <sham1> Never seen significant unit tests in strongly typed languages? You must not like python then
[15:26:04] <Franciman> do you use scheme for doing apple development, mdhughes ?
[15:26:05] <sham1> An understandable reaction but still very silly
[15:26:09] <Franciman> do you use it for iOS apps?
[15:26:11] <Franciman> i'd love to
[15:26:17] <Franciman> fucking hell, I want to
[15:26:29] <mdhughes> No, I've seen what was supposed to be very serious, professional Ocaml software. It's used in a number of industries.
[15:27:39] <mdhughes> sham1: Python's not strongly or strictly typed. It's all test-based safety, thanks to doctests.
[15:27:55] <sham1> Oh but it is strongly typed. A str won't turn into an int
[15:28:11] <sham1> Or vise versa without a cast
[15:28:29] <LeoNerd> "strongly typed" isn't a well-defined phrase. It usually means "has a type system the author agrees with"
[15:28:49] <mdhughes> Except when you pass something to a function, what you get back out is indeterminate. And everything works on a numeric tower that up-/down-casts.
[15:29:33] <sham1> It's not indeterminate. Or if it is, the API is bad and the author should feel bad
[15:29:54] <mdhughes> Python also doesn't care what you pass in for files, etc. as long as they duck-type the couple methods it's looking for.
[15:30:41] <mdhughes> That's what I call dynamic/weak/duck typing. One that checks all that and doesn't allow any variation is strong/strict/BDSM.
[15:30:59] <sham1> Well in that case you're incorrect
[15:31:23] <sham1> Because first of all, dynamic and weak typing aren't synonyms, and neither is duck typing
[15:31:39] <mdhughes> Franciman: Sadly I don't have a good workflow for putting Scheme on iOS. But I've got ObjC for that already. My current problem is cross-platform desktop code, and Scheme's nice for it.
[15:31:41] <sham1> And same for static typing and strong typing. They're actually orthogonal
[15:32:10] <mdhughes> They might be in your own private lexicon, but no two nerds can agree on those terms.
[15:32:26] <Franciman> mdhughes: what toolkit do you use for GUI?
[15:32:29] <sham1> It just happens to be the private lexicon of the majority of the field
[15:33:00] <mdhughes> Franciman: Just SDL2. I've done experiments with other toolkits, but I don't like anything.
[15:33:18] <mdhughes> sham1: You and the many lurkers supporting you in email…
[15:33:21] <Franciman> oh wow, i'd find it hard to write widgets in SDL2
[15:33:31] <Franciman> very nice
[15:39:12] <ns12> Franciman: What ML language do you use? OCaml or Standard ML?
[15:40:02] <Franciman> i mostly use haskell
[15:41:52] <ns12> mdhughes: What is this "BDSM" that you refer to? This https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM ? But I don't see how this sexual thing is related to programming languages.

[15:42:39] <Franciman> ns12: because it was hinted that working with types is like being tortured
[15:43:31] <ns12> Okay, thanks for the link.
[15:43:35] <mdhughes> It is a rude expression, but eh. It's an accurate description of how it feels. I ain't a bottom to any machine.
[15:46:38] <Franciman> actually you are, because you depend on tests and on the output of a machine to be sure that your software is correct
[15:48:38] <mdhughes> No, I write the tests. The machine only does what I tell it.
[15:50:38] <Franciman> lol then you wouldn't need tess
[15:50:40] <Franciman> tests
[15:51:18] <Franciman> if the machine only does what you tell it to, and you tell it to check that you wrote code correctly
[15:51:23] <Franciman> you depend on its output
[15:52:00] <Franciman> and if the machine only did what you told her to, then you either need help to figure that what you told it to do is what you want
[15:52:06] <Franciman> or be blind and hope for the best
[15:53:14] <ns12> Franciman: You don't write unit tests when programming in Haskell?

[15:55:12] *** Joins: Andrew (andrew@andrewyu.org)
[15:55:26] <ns12> Is there a language where unit tests are not necessary due to the sophistication of the type system?
[15:57:59] <Franciman> ns12: there are languages with very powerful type systems in which you can prove that your program has desired properties. But there are a few problems with this
[15:58:09] <Franciman> 1. they are very new or bleeding edge, so not very easy to use
[15:58:21] <Franciman> 2. formally defining your requirements can be A LOT of work and a lot of tedious work
[15:58:35] <Franciman> examples of these langueages are Coq, Agda, Idris, Lean
[15:58:46] <Franciman> you can use them to also do mathematics and prove theorems
[15:59:05] <Franciman> so writing tests is more practical most of the time

[18:51:15] <ns12> And yet some people still dream of Lisp machines.
[18:52:15] <mdhughes> Well if you do it in software on something getting mass production, it's a fine idea. Make a LM on ARM.
[18:53:07] <mdhughes> It's just silly when you've got a market of maybe 1,000 and you're hand-soldering these things, and hoping you'll beat the performance of anyone else.

[18:54:42] <mdhughes> TI made the chip, but the board was more like a '70s minicomputer's, at least from the photos I've seen. I assume they couldn't get a production line for that few.
