[03:04:28] <SteppenwolfVM> libertarians are antisocial, yes

[03:09:22] <LibertyDillo> DOMF> he's kind of a shitlib now << since he came out saying that people who don't get vaxxed should be shunned and isolated from society, yeah
[03:09:41] <LibertyDillo> I'm through with whatever resepect I had for him
[03:09:48] <DOMF> No, since he basically implied that antifascists are just as bad as fascists
[03:09:51] <SteppenwolfVM> hahaha
[03:10:08] <SteppenwolfVM> sounds like LibertyDillo got slammed by his own idol
[03:10:10] <louipc> its quite strange so many people are afraid to join an on-topic irc channel to discuss a certain topic
[03:10:13] <LibertyDillo> that one I hadn't heard
[03:10:25] <louipc> comfort-zone and safe space are real
[03:10:29] <LibertyDillo> agreed loupic
[03:10:37] <SteppenwolfVM> well
[03:10:39] <LibertyDillo> and now, back to the music...
[03:10:42] <DOMF> I think people who don't get vaxxed should be shunned and isolated from society but that goes for way more than the covid vaccine
[03:10:45] <DOMF> lol "afraid"

[03:11:48] <LibertyDillo> I heard there was a new one, yeah loupic
[03:11:53] <SteppenwolfVM> louipc and LibertyDillo, let's assume i joined your "altpolitics" chat... you'd elaborate how you're about "freedump", personal choice, while totally supporting intense limitations on the freedom of people *not* being your kind, even if you could so something for them
[03:12:07] <LibertyDillo> personally, The Rutles is my favorite
[03:12:09] <SteppenwolfVM> and i'd explain how i think that's wrong, and simply disagree 
[03:12:22] <SteppenwolfVM> i don't think that makes any sense as an debate, does it?`
[03:12:41] <sublim20> look, there are only two options in a debate, the correct position (mine) and the wrong one, (yours).   its pretty straightforward

[03:19:19] <DOMF> heh
[03:19:34] <Bakunin> I think he's right actually
[03:19:39] <Bakunin> he criticises tactics
[03:19:43] <Bakunin> he is right to do so
[03:19:52] <Bakunin> he's not saying "antifa, as a concept, is bad"
[03:19:57] <sublim20> this is the greatest philospher of our era  -> https://notallbits.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/sashagreyread.jpg
[03:20:05] <Bakunin> I have the same opinion about certain tactics
[03:20:11] <SteppenwolfVM> ?
[03:20:20] <Bakunin> When people at Occupy bloced up, I left, DOMF
[03:20:20] <SteppenwolfVM> which concept is antifascism?
[03:20:32] <SteppenwolfVM> it's just opposing fascism, without an solid concept
[03:20:37] <Bakunin> SteppenwolfVM specific to the United States, the people opposing the neonazis 
[03:20:46] <SteppenwolfVM> same thing in the US
[03:20:48] <Bakunin> he's talking about the US movement in particular
[03:20:49] <DOMF> I very much disagree with that 
[03:21:16] <Bakunin> that's fine but I fail to see why smashing plate glass on a closed storefront "brings meaningful change" to your side
[03:21:35] <DOMF> when comrades bloc up I bloc up as well.
[03:21:38] <Bakunin> or other negative cycles
[03:22:10] <Bakunin> yeah see, we agree on most points about the problems, but we disagree on solutions
[03:22:12] <sublim20> oh sweet, all the worlds problems, gonna be solved, tonight, here, in this irc channel

[03:22:18] <DOMF> fuck yeah
[03:22:21] <DOMF> \mm/
[03:22:55] <sublim20> so anywayz, how about that geopolitical situation unfolding in rwanda
[03:22:57] <Bakunin> DOMF I have some examples which might make you reconsider property destruction as a method to achieve racial or class parity
[03:23:00] <sublim20> pretty complicated eh?
[03:23:10] <Bakunin> they generally involve lower-income and PoC store owners.
[03:23:50] <SteppenwolfVM> you can be a capitalist warmonger and still be antifascist, you can be an autonomous homeless and also be antifascist, it doesn't matter
[03:24:01] <SteppenwolfVM> antifa = opposing fascism, that's that, the end, not more and not less 
[03:24:03] <DOMF> I never once said that I consider property destruction a method to achieve racial or class parity 
[03:24:15] <Bakunin> SteppenwolfVM not sure about that first one :)
[03:24:22] <DOMF> I just think it's the absolute last thing anyone should complain about while literal fascists are marching around with torches

[20:05:53] <artao> depends how much and what city
[20:06:10] <artao> usually 3 to 7 grams is misdemeanor
[20:06:14] <murthy> like an ounce?
[20:06:20] <murthy> oh ok
[20:06:23] <artao> prolly a felony
[20:06:41] <artao> particularly if it's bagged out. then it's intent to distribute
[20:07:36] <artao> in madison it's technically legal, so it depends which police bust you
[20:07:44] <artao> campus cops will generally just take your shit and let you go
[20:07:52] <artao> city cops ... it depends on the cop
