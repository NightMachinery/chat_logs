[03:08:31] <ttys000> god damn i swear microsoft does this every tiume.
[03:08:35] <ttys000> the gaslighting is too damn high
[03:08:49] <ttys000> they just lifted the ban and then said "we don't see any problems with your ip" as their response.
[03:09:04] <ttys000> "We were unable to identify anything on our side that would prevent your mail from reaching Outlook.com customers."
[03:09:15] <ttys000> and of course, i send a test send, and it goes through just fine. no problems.

[05:05:56] <acidsys> I wouldn't have thought of that. but I think it was a web GUI of some sort

[05:06:26] <ttys000> initially it is a web gui, but then they reply via the banned email address. and you think to just reply to their reply via email...

[12:51:55] <tiny> Hello.  I'm having issues with delivering email to businesses with outlook.com protection. Our IP is on a protection.outlook.com list. I have spf, dkim and dmarc set up. Is there a quick way to relay all email trough some reliable smtp relay server? I need a quick solution before I move to a more reliable vps provider (linode now)
[12:52:05] <tiny> We're not listed anyhere on spam list. I've checked with multiple online tools (mxtoolbox...)

[13:26:12] <tuxick> people using outlook just don't want to get mail
[13:27:04] <tuxick> tiny: are you forwarding mails to outlook?
[13:27:27] <Khepra> it's not that bad really. I know clients that I successfully kicked out of our system onto gsuites and outlooks and they're enjoying their new service provider
[13:27:55] <tuxick> except their blackholes
[13:28:25] <tuxick> whenever someone tells me they didn't get a mail they're on outlook or they lie
[13:28:26] <tiny> tuxick:  I don't know what you mean by forwarding. We send email to our clients and they get immediately rejected.
[13:28:32] <Khepra> email is becoming terrible business. gmail is known to lose mail. not even Junk'ed, just... lost. accepted, status=sent, but never to be seen again.
[13:28:40] <tiny> with "message undelivered"
[13:28:45] <tuxick> ah right, gmails get lost too
[13:29:09] <Khepra> I actually never heard of outlook doing that,  but not reason not to believe you. it's just that I've seen gmail do that, first hand
[13:29:13] <tiny> what about zoho? I'm really considering dedicated provider at this point
[13:29:54] <tuxick> what's a zoho?
[13:30:25] <tiny> :)
[13:31:14] <tiny> just something I found on this list https://fitsmallbusiness.com/best-business-email-providers/
[13:31:18] <Khepra> zoho looks like one of those... jacks of many trades, masters of none
[13:31:38] <Khepra> CRM, projects, analytics, customer service..... aaaand email.
[13:32:11] <Khepra> tiny: what kind of emailing volume you have, how many domains or accounts?
[13:32:30] <Khepra> approximately. one, few, tens, hundreds, thousands?
[13:33:08] <tiny> Khepra: 2 domains, 30 acounts+ 
[13:33:54] <Khepra> so maybe anything other than cheap-o "ninenty nine" cents public clouds is financial overkill...
[13:34:39] <Khepra> that's teh uncanny valley between "just use gmail with vanity domain" and DIY dedicated machine, two-or-three digits per month rented server
[13:35:00] <tiny> hehe, exactly
[13:36:13] <Khepra> because the latter is what I'd recommend. Actually I'd just recommend forget email and submit to gsuites and outlooks, they won.  But if you want to DIY, you can maintain a decent mailing environment taht in the course of several months builds IP reputation, and your sole problem becomes teaching spam assassin's bayes filter.
[13:36:55] <Khepra> and simply accept the fact that email is never granted to be delivered anywhere. it's a dying tech, infested by spammers and networks that shoot first, ask questions later, even if you never had a single spam incident in years.
[13:37:28] <Khepra> besides, all the kids these days prefer instant messaging. vibers, whatsapps, fecesbooks, ...
[13:47:18] <tuxick> problem with training bayes is that a single user can't
[13:47:36] <Khepra> why not?
[13:47:37] <tuxick> the other problem is that users can't
[13:47:43] <tuxick> Khepra: not enough data
[13:49:12] <tuxick> so you use shared bayes database and you get next problem
[13:49:44] <tuxick> users report false positives, like legitimate mailings they even subscribed to

[13:59:27] <tiny> tuxick: What did you mean by "even OVH started cleaning up"?  They're reviewing email servers hosted on their infrastructure?
[14:02:18] <tuxick> there used to be so much spam coming from their network they got blacklisted everywhere
[14:02:36] <tuxick> the logical solution is to not allow outgoing :25 by default
[14:02:47] <tuxick> dunno what they do/did though

[14:06:40] <Khepra> they allow it but they supposedly scan all outgoing email
[14:12:01] <tiny> I'm considering hosting a virtual email server on amazon lightsail e.i. moving existing linode server there.
[14:12:59] <tiny> but I need to prepare all this regardless of the end solution I'll chose so...
[14:13:31] <tiny> is there possibly a quicker way with some sort of smart host / relay host that will handle all my email until I switch providers?
[14:14:40] <Khepra> you can alwys DIY one
[14:15:36] <tiny> I need a quick solution for email delivery to companies using protecion.outlook.com
[14:16:15] <tiny> Khepra: you mean create my own relay server on some other IP?
[14:19:15] <Khepra> yes
[14:19:57] <Khepra> raise postfix, configure it either with quick sasl or just ghetto it with mynetworks AND a firewall permitting only your main server IP
[14:20:44] <tiny> that's a good idea :)
[14:21:37] <Khepra> make sure you adjust SPF and I'm not sure if you need to do anything for DKIM, the relay would just add a Received header that's usually not part of signing. But, something to test and look out for, I suppose
