[00:01:34] <bremner> is it minified or something?
[00:02:12] <ano> sort of compression, emacs -Q + so-long-mode doesn't make much difference, seems emacs just broken for modern compressed js/html

[00:03:12] *** grettke-away is now known as grettke
[00:03:24] <bremner> anyway, you didn't ask about that, so the short version is that emacs is not great with really long lines
[00:04:32] <ano> i can, but it takes forever to open and prettify such files
[00:06:42] <edgar-rft> compressed js/html somehow doesn't sound as if it was meant for editing

[00:12:28] <bremner> I regularly open fairly large files, so maybe font-lock (highlighting) is the bottleneck there
[00:13:06] <ano> doubt while tested with >emacs -Q + so-long-mode

[05:35:28] <bremner> by arrays you mean notation for pointer addition?
[05:36:22] <bremner> I haven't seriously considered what makes an array. So apparently not bounds checking.
[05:36:58] <bpalmer> so, e.g., char foo[10]; printf("%d\n", sizeof(foo)); will output "10"; whereas int foo(char bar[10]) { printf("%d\n", sizeof(bar)); } will probably output something like 4 when foo is called.
[05:37:14] <bpalmer> because arrays decay into pointers in function parameters.

[15:13:45] <beshr> btw I (think) I found out what the problem was with my emacs excessive CPU usage from yesterday
[15:13:52] <beshr> Tried to start emacs in a terminal and it worked totally fine, so I thought it might be a Wayland/XWayland issue, so i tried to `./configure --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --with-cairo` and now it loads ok

[18:02:06] <oats> samlamamma, yes, at my place of work, right now :D
[18:02:06] <wasamasa> my-list is ("a" "b")

[18:02:14] <oats> I've been really happy with clangd
[18:02:21] <wasamasa> ("a" "b") looks like a function call to eval
[18:02:35] <wasamasa> so it evaluates the first argument "b", then tries to call "a"
[18:02:37] <wasamasa> that fails
