[00:21:04] <doug16k> (AWS) RDS seems I/O bottlenecked badly for me. It feels like we have some burst allowance, then it does the rest slowly
[00:21:14] <doug16k> well indexed select is quick. alter table takes forever
[00:21:31] <doug16k> on a db where the entire file fits in ram
[00:22:17] <doug16k> seems like Isotopp's comment applies to me too
[00:24:37] <doug16k> (using a vm with faster storage instead of the normal large one)
[00:27:15] <doug16k> it's amazing to have so much ram it can hold everything or nearly, and it has to synchronize around starved write completions and idle
[00:28:08] <doug16k> s/amazing/awful/
[00:33:58] <doug16k> if you make an index on (a), and another index on (a, b), and another index on (a, b, c), would mysql see how stupid that is and make just the last one?
[00:35:14] <doug16k> perhaps creating an illusion that the 1st two are there
[00:35:38] <doug16k> but three of them share the one B+ tree
[00:36:03] <doug16k> no right?
[00:36:57] <doug16k> I am asking, should I spend time looking for blunder indexes that are already covered by another compound index?
[00:37:36] <doug16k> mysqlworkbench does it sometimes
[00:37:53] <doug16k> (creates another index on the same thing)
[00:38:28] <doug16k> example: you click unique and primary key
[00:41:49] <doug16k> you end up with one or more redundant indexes because of foreign keys right? where the one for the foreign key is the same as the prefix of a compound index
[01:13:25] <Xgc> doug16k: Most databases won't do that.  But they might have a tuning advisor to warn you about unnecessary indexes.
[01:15:11] <Xgc> doug16k: A FK constraint probably won't automatically create an index if there's already an appropriate composite index.
[01:15:57] <Xgc> doug16k: But, if you drop that composite index, the database will probably automatically create the required one.
[01:22:34] <Xgc> doug16k: It looks like the DROP fails (at least in MySQL 8.0), so you have to add the new index before dropping the composite.

[20:40:46] <theseb> where are databases stored? in files?  is there a hidden directory/folder of database *files* somewhere?....BTW..why was sqlite so "innovative"?....they basically put the database in a file? so what?
[20:41:39] <Naktibalda> in datadir
[20:41:47] <Naktibalda> it isn't hidden
[20:42:35] <Naktibalda> usually in /var/lib/mysql
[20:43:00] <AllenJB> sqlite isn't innovative - it's just a different database for a different use case
[20:43:13] <theseb> Naktibalda: see so mysql uses files too! so why is everyone giddy about sqlite?
[20:43:25] <theseb> AllenJB: what is the use case?
[20:44:23] <Naktibalda> sqlite is simpler because it doesn't use client-server architecture
[20:45:38] <Naktibalda> you can use it anywhere where you can create a file and you don't have to ask for server to be installed.
[20:45:42] <AllenJB> perhaps rather than "for a different use case", "with different properties / strengths" - it's good at single-threaded or infrequent write usage, but can't handle simultaneous writes well
[20:46:39] <Naktibalda> SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen().
[20:46:53] <AllenJB> it's often used as a datastore in apps (Firefox uses, or used, it for things like bookmarks, history and other data storage, for example)
[20:47:17] <theseb> But if sqlite is just a stripped down version of a "real database" couldn't mysql and postgresql have made a "lite" version too ?
