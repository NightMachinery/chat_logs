[05:29:24] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> @ElegantBeef I'm just checking ... if I never want to use nim for interfacing with C libs (or another non-nim libs), can I get away with not learning pointers & ref's, or will I be limited? (I don't know if I'm explaining myself well)
[05:30:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well you'll want to learn ref semantics and the like, but you might be able to. I wouldnt be scared of them Nim makes them quite easy to use
[05:30:22] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Nim has some of the better pointer semantics imo
[05:31:04] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> what are ref's good for? ... I've seen them in the docs, but it doesn't really say what I'd need them? Sorry for the noob questions I keep asking
[05:31:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Pointers afterall are just integers they're not that scary
[05:32:01] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Refer to this writeup https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8426#54529
[05:32:09] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It probably should be expanded and added to the manual
[05:32:27] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> Hehe I guess reading people having problems with pointers in this channel was scaring me. OK I'll ready that - thank you! üôÇ
[05:33:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Pointers are legitmately just an address to memory, they're not that scary in Nim since we know that they're not an array or are an array thanks to the type system
[05:33:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> In C you might have a `char` which is a ptr to a char, but you can do `yourCharPtr[3]` wheras in nim it'd be a `ptr UncheckedArray[char]` to be able to do that
[05:34:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> A `ptr char` cannot be indexed in Nim
[05:34:13] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Many modern languages do this though
[05:35:15] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> if you've ever used a `var T` parameter in a procedure you've already used pointers btw
[05:35:42] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> In reply to @Elegantbeef "if you've ever used": Oh! ok hehe
[05:36:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Though these pointers are special in that they're ensured they do not outlive the proc
[05:36:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Which is for a safety reason that you might have a pointer to the stack that becomes a dangling pointer
[05:37:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> What language do you come from again?
[05:37:09] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> "dangling pointer" <-- see what I mean about these scary words? üòâ

[05:37:36] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> a pointer to memory that's no longer valid
[05:37:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well it's not that scary since nim doesnt allow you to do it unless you do it "unsafely"
[05:38:04] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> but yeah, pointers are a lot less scary in nim
[05:38:38] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I learned pointers in Nim and yea they're nice here
[05:38:41] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You dont have ambiguity
[05:38:41] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> you can still mess yourself up with them, but you rarely need to do unsafe things unless you're interfacing with C
[05:39:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Or getting around the language safety rails

[05:41:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Like i said codic you cannot capute `var` without views
[05:41:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You can make it a `ptr Client`
[05:41:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Assuming you know it's safe to do
[05:42:13] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> To be safe `WM` will not be destroyed whilst the `Option[ptr Client]` exists
[05:42:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> or just `ptr Client` exists
[05:43:11] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And i guess you dont resize clients whilst it's open
[05:43:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> whilst it exists\
[05:43:23] <FromDiscord> <codic> It won't be destroyed
[05:43:42] <FromDiscord> <codic> Yeah I'll use raw pointers

[05:43:53] <FromDiscord> <codic> ?
[05:44:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So be extra certain you do not mutate the `clients` whilst you have that ptr

[05:44:54] <FromDiscord> <codic> what if I don't use the pointer

[05:46:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Indeed
[05:46:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The compiler is much better at reasoning lifetimes than mere mortals sadly
[05:46:34] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I cut myself on the edge of experimental once
[05:46:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Damn was it bleeding?
[05:46:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yeah
[05:46:58] <FromDiscord> <codic> I'll use raw pointers then when it makes it into stable I'll rewrite to use far superior lent
[05:47:09] <FromDiscord> <codic> I'm rewriting my rust wm rn because rust sucks
[05:47:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Why do you think so
[05:47:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Ah writing it sucks I guess
[05:47:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Otherwise it‚Äôs pretty good as long as it‚Äôs not me who‚Äôs writing it üôÇ
[05:47:56] <FromDiscord> <codic> you have to prove to compiler that stuff is safe in twisted ways
[05:48:00] <FromDiscord> <codic> lol yeah
[05:48:22] <FromDiscord> <codic> for example I can't store &'a mut Client or something so I had to store an index instead and index into the Vec every time
[05:48:39] <FromDiscord> <codic> or I couldn't return mutable reference from function while other functions in the caller function mutably borrow
[05:48:47] <FromDiscord> <codic> it's just shit to write
[05:49:00] <FromDiscord> <codic> but in some aspects its really awesome
[05:49:06] <FromDiscord> <codic> https://github.com/codic12/worm/blob/main/src/wm.rs this was the code
[05:49:10] <FromDiscord> <Rika> It‚Äôs probably a conceptual difference between how you think and what the compiler was made for or so
[05:49:55] <FromDiscord> <codic> Yeah but there are just some things Rust can't do safely that logically makes sense
[05:50:18] <FromDiscord> <codic> The ultimate task can still be achieved you just have to do it in a way that makes the borrow checker happy rather than the way that makes you happy
[05:50:31] <FromDiscord> <codic> I wanted to write this in Zig but Zig's standard library changes too much for me atm
[05:50:37] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Or you enter `unsafe` and then get flamed by the armchair programmers
[05:51:53] <FromDiscord> <codic> yes
[05:52:22] <FromDiscord> <codic> Really if Rust was `unsafe` by default and had a `safe` keyword I would consider it the best language in the world
[05:52:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And people wouldnt use it
[05:53:11] <FromDiscord> <codic> People would still use it
[05:53:15] <FromDiscord> <codic> People use Nim
[05:53:26] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Much less than now
[05:53:35] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Rust has a different goal from Nim‚Äôs
[05:53:45] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Rust‚Äôs point is safety
[05:54:08] <FromDiscord> <codic> sure, and I might write my rocket system in Rust
[05:54:25] <FromDiscord> <codic> although if I was writing a rocket system, I might use even safer Ada
[05:54:41] <FromDiscord> <codic> or if I was writing google's servers, I might want to use rust
[05:54:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I really wish the formal proving system in Nim didn‚Äôt die
[05:54:56] <FromDiscord> <codic> but if I'm just writing code to use on people's computers for fun, I don't need the focus on safety and the costs that come with it
[05:55:02] <FromDiscord> <codic> sounds cool what was that
[05:55:16] <FromDiscord> <codic> isn't there that dr nim thing which does thta
[05:55:17] <FromDiscord> <codic> (edit) "thta" => "that"
[05:55:25] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Same thing that makes Ada safe I would say

[20:18:57] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @Professor Actual Factual "When calling on C": try/except won't work if the C side errors crashes (with SIGSEGV or something similar) to begin with
[20:19:32] <FromDiscord> <Professor Actual Factual> In reply to @Yardanico "try/except won't work if": Whats the best way to go about this then?
[20:19:34] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> try/except only works with Nim exceptions (and C++ exceptions when compiled with the C++ backend)
[20:19:56] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @Professor Actual Factual "Whats the best way": ensure that you're not calling the C code in an erroneous way?
[20:20:18] <FromDiscord> <tandy> sorry, went to bed \:) tictactoe with an AI player using the minimax algorithm
[20:20:40] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @Professor Actual Factual "Whats the best way": can you provide some more info about what C code are you trying to call and why is it crashing on free?
[20:22:38] <FromDiscord> <Professor Actual Factual> In reply to @Yardanico "can you provide some": just wrapping a DB implementation from C.‚ÜµIm kind of worried that if a user does CRTL+C midway through the process or run out of disk space they will get memory leak.‚ÜµWanted to know the best way to avoid this.
[20:22:58] <Amun-Ra> use defer
[20:23:18] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> even better - wrap your C stuff in objects and use destructors :)
[20:23:35] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @Professor Actual Factual also, not sure I understand - if a user does Ctrl+C midway, then the program will terminate and all the process memory will be automatically free'd anyway
[20:24:02] <FromDiscord> <Professor Actual Factual> The C code has to be free'd manually for this one.
[20:24:08] <Amun-Ra> yes, but freeing memory the proper way is good practice
[20:24:49] <FromDiscord> <Professor Actual Factual> Does C code get free'd from a CRTL-C or other errors? I thought not.
[20:25:33] <Amun-Ra> yes, OS will take care of that (you shouldn't leak mem anyway tho)
[20:26:59] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> there is an argument to be made to avoid freeing memory at the end of your program, because the OS will do that, and it will do it more efficiently than you
[20:27:14] <Amun-Ra> I finished supporting another old format for my image viewer in Nim: https://postimg.cc/vcBNDjyT
[20:27:21] <FromDiscord> <Professor Actual Factual> Ok thats good to know. Thanks everyone üôÇ
[20:27:50] <Amun-Ra> Professor: I'm using defer for those situations
[20:28:07] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @Amun-Ra that's fine, but IMO destructors are cleaner and better to use :)
[20:28:13] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> they especially work amazing with ARC
[20:28:27] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> (that said, they work with refc too)
[20:28:43] <Amun-Ra> Yardanico: right, they are; I don't use ref that much personally
[20:28:52] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> not sure I understand
[20:28:55] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> destructors don't need `ref`
[20:29:02] <Amun-Ra> hmm
[20:29:04] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> You can have a normal `object` and have a destructor defined for it
[20:29:53] <Amun-Ra> I must have missed that detail, thanks
[20:30:48] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3E0U
[20:31:40] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> and then you can also test memory leaks with `--gc:orc` (or arc if you're sure you don't have cycles) and `-d:useMalloc`
[20:31:43] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> then valgrind will work just fine
[20:32:55] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> see https://nim-lang.org/docs/destructors.html
[21:03:54] <FromDiscord> <Professor Actual Factual> Can you explain what cycles are via code example? Or possibly share some resources on the topic? Much appreciated
[21:09:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> first points to second
[21:09:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://paste.rs/wjR

[23:03:57] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> ha! my boy
[23:04:01] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> wtf is a bitlist
[23:04:26] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> mh which context?
[23:04:37] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> If you have a procedure or function that calculate a length of collatz sequence, it should not be so hard to find max length.
[23:04:48] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> or'ed flags maybe ?  @hmmm

[23:06:08] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> setitem works correctly, if I call it and set a status it will set, what it's not working is the getstate proc, that will always return 3 lol
[23:06:26] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> so I thought it has to do with the fact that I have no idea what a bitlist is
[23:06:58] *** Joins: anjovi (~userf@gateway/tor-sasl/mantisfan)
[23:07:12] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> ah yes, these are just or'd flags
[23:07:17] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> really common in winapi
[23:07:24] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> wtf is an ord flag D:
[23:07:38] <Amun-Ra> or'd as in bitwise-OR
[23:07:40] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> basically its just an integer, but you can store multiple "flags" in the integer
[23:07:43] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> and why it returns 3 üò©
[23:08:03] <FromDiscord> <tandy> is it possible to find an instance of an object in a seq? i used find when looking for a `(int, int)` but now that I am looking for an instance of a OOLib class it won't ever find it..
[23:08:12] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> maybe the default flags of the item is 3
[23:08:29] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> what do you want to achive?
[23:08:34] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> all the item return 3 and an item I've just changed a flag of will return 3
[23:08:37] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> 3 is the answer
[23:09:00] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I'm trying to make an item turn bright
[23:09:27] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> there is the flag wListStateDropHighlighted that does just that
[23:10:02] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> then i think the way to go is to get the current state and `or` it with wListStateDropHighlighted
[23:10:05] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> but after turning it bright I want to turn it normal, and I need to check the state first and to do that getstate has to work and not just spit 3 lol

[23:13:24] <Amun-Ra> tandy: traverse a seq and compare it with 'of'
[23:14:39] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> @hmmm\:  the winapi flag is actually called `LVIS_DROPHILITED`
[23:14:45] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> maybe you can find more information
[23:14:58] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I'm dropping the hmmm here
[23:15:02] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hmmmm
[23:15:17] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> it could be that its only valid with certain combinations of other flags
[23:15:47] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> eg\: https://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?435322-How-to-get-the-LVIS_DROPHILITED-state-of-item
[23:15:57] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> `1. If you're running with version 6 or higher of comctl32.dll, you can use the LVS_EX_DOUBLEBUFFER style. `
[23:19:56] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> also related to wnim in general: control have styles, sometimes I want to have a control in two styles at the same time but it never works. Something like x=TextCtrl(panel, style=wTeMultiLine and wTeReadOnly) but it never works for me. I've seen people using or but that doesn't work for me too
[23:20:43] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I'm confus :nimAngry:
[23:22:06] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> https://blog.podkalicki.com/bit-level-operations-bit-flags-and-bit-masks/
[23:22:23] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> `To set a flag, we use bitwise OR equals operator (|=). It allows turning individual bits on.`
[23:22:38] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> so they must be `or` ed instead of and
[23:23:10] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> wow this article is golden
[23:23:14] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> so this might work\:‚Üµ`x=TextCtrl(panel, style=wTeMultiLine orwTeReadOnly)`
[23:24:17] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> why would people ever use something that arcane when I could just call a flag is beyond me
[23:24:21] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> if you figure out the autolayout dsl let me know \:D
[23:24:28] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> lol no way
[23:25:12] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> it might be very smart and clever, unfortunately too clever for me
[23:26:10] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I'm prodigiously clever when I sleep, when I wake I lose my superpowers :<
[23:36:33] <FromDiscord> <Rika> so, you never sleep then
