[00:01:54] <j416> enabled core.commitGraph, ran git commit-graph write, bisect still takes forever at 100% CPU
[00:02:58] <rafasc> seems that it  defaults to true nowadays.
[00:03:15] <rafasc> maybe set it to false.
[00:04:15] <j416> set it explicitly to false, bisect still takes a long time
[00:04:17] <rafasc> Could be something related to that, like building the graph being expensive. Idk.
[00:04:47] <rafasc> did you test with rev-list?

[00:06:10] <rafasc> the commit.graph should help, but yeah. Maybe it's just linux being big.
[00:06:28] <j416> I suppose that'd be git rev-list --bisect v5.1 ^v3.11 ?
[00:06:44] <imauser> would be nice if git would then cache whatever it's doing so that it doesn't need to be run for each bisect command
[00:06:57] <rafasc> j416: Yeah.
[00:07:17] <rafasc> imauser: that's more or less what commit.graph does, I believe
[00:07:37] <j416> "git rev-list --bisect v5.1 ^v3.11" takes 100% CPU and a long time, too
[00:07:55] <rafasc> well, we need to bisect git to check if this is new or not. :D

[08:18:11] <elibrokeit> what if you try something actually straightforward like git -C foo log featureA
[08:19:43] <hexology> same thing. also i am not actually using -C,  i just have 2 different terminal windows open... just in case that makes a difference too (hopefully it shouldn't?)
[08:20:27] <hexology> if i manually do `git -C foo log` with the actual commit hash of where featureA is supposed to be, it says the commit doesn't exist
[08:20:34] <elibrokeit> it should not, it is supposed to just do a chdir / set the git_dir before acting
[08:20:39] <hexology> so it's not even that the branch pointer is wrong, somehow there are two different git histories now
[08:21:04] <hexology> and i clearly see the worktree `foo-1` listed in `git -C foo worktree list`

[08:21:46] <elibrokeit> yeah, that does indicate borkenness
[08:21:59] <elibrokeit> what's the content of foo-1/.git
[08:22:13] *** Joins: jonosterman (~Rheanna@101.91.192.124)
[08:23:26] <hexology> wait...
[08:23:30] <hexology> this might be PEBCAK
[08:23:37] <hexology> yep...
[08:23:49] <hexology> this is more or less the equivalent of `foo` vs `fo0`
[08:23:56] <elibrokeit> :o
[08:24:10] <hexology> the former is the main repo with the work tree, the latter is a separate repo using the former as a remote
[08:24:13] <elibrokeit> anyway this rubberducking too is a valid use of #git
[08:24:29] <hexology> hah
[08:24:33] <hexology> i'm kind of confused now
[08:24:42] <hexology> but i *think* i figured out what happened
[08:25:12] <hexology> oh i made an even bigger mess than i realized
[08:25:29] <hexology> thanks for being the duck today
[08:26:07] <elibrokeit> :)
[08:28:49] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-239-62-159.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[08:29:55] <hexology> your tip about checking the .git file helped
[08:30:29] <hexology> if you want to know what _actually_ happened: i had something like (1) `/usr/local/src/foo`, (2) `~/dev/foo`, (3) `~/dev/foo-wt/featureA`, and (4) `/usr/local/src/foo-featureA`. (2) was cloned from (1), (3) was a work tree of (1), (4) was cloned from (1) but with `featureA` checked out
[08:31:15] <elibrokeit> huh
[08:31:24] <hexology> i had thought (3) was a work tree of (2), hence my confusion
[08:31:48] <hexology> and actually (4) was cloned from (2), not (1). i can't even keep it straight!
[08:31:49] <elibrokeit> see, this is why I usually just switch branches instead of having multiple clones or worktrees
[08:32:08] <elibrokeit> because I usually hope that I don't actually need simultaneous checkouts
[08:32:23] <hexology> normally i have 1 main repo `~/Projects/foo` and 1 directory of worktrees `~/Projects/foo-wt/<branch>`
[08:32:49] <hexology> i started using work trees when i got a job where i was working on concurrent unrelated projects within a monorepo
[08:33:14] <hexology> it's a really great feature. but this got too hairy (partly due to my bad naming), so i am going to undo this as soon as everything is pushed to a single remote
[08:33:15] <elibrokeit> monorepos would do it...

[08:57:21] <elibrokeit> jaggz: :( generally this would be listed as a clone url in a correctly configured gitweb, otherwise you need to guess which clone url if there even is one

[09:05:01] <elibrokeit> jaggz: if worst comes to worst, you can carefully trawl the gitweb HTML interface and download every commit as a patch file, and use this to reassemble the repo locally (with clashing GIT_COMMITTER_NAME / GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL but all things considered that's still pretty high fidelity)

[09:08:45] <jaggz> elibrokeit, I must admit my motivation isn't that high.  Someone mentioned that it would be nice to preserve his work, as we don't know how long it'll stay up, so I figured I could clone it and put it in my own github site in his honor
[09:09:00] <jaggz> but I don't have use for the project myself -- it just might be useful to others in the world so..
[09:09:11] <jaggz> Could just take the final snapshot too, in that case :)
[09:09:18] <elibrokeit> that would be nice, yes...
[09:09:41] <jaggz> looks like he's using this git web project.. it has a module for git via http but it seems, if it were working, it would have functioned at that url
[09:09:43] <jaggz> https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-http-backend.html

[09:14:20] <elibrokeit> well!
[09:14:37] <elibrokeit> that does seem like quite the lucky turn of events :)
[09:15:12] <jaggz> well he can do this himself then!  sheesh!
[09:15:14] <jaggz> ;D
[09:15:17] * jaggz happy
[09:16:45] <elibrokeit> try to get in contact with him and point out that after this confusion arose, people were trying and failing to clone his repos for archival. This should be good incentive to make sure that a functioning clone url is put in place
[09:17:08] <jaggz> yeah I did!
[09:17:25] <jaggz> <ferret> hes ok

[17:59:44] <rafasc> Vipulk: they aren't the same kind of template. But you can put your commit_template in the templatedir and configure commit.template to .git/commit_template
[18:01:03] <rafasc> the templatedir is essentially a scaffolding to build the .git/ directory when you git init, or when clone inits the repository for you.
[18:03:15] <Vipulk> Okay, thank you!
[18:05:32] <rafasc> keep in mind that those files are copied on init. So if you change the template, it will not update any existing repos.

[18:05:36] <Vipulk> Configured, commit.template to .git/commit-msg.template.

[18:46:17] <rafasc> git is a version control tool, basically you had local changes that were "incompatible" with the new changes from the remote repository. Git noticed this, and is asking you to decide which side should be the real version.
[18:47:24] <rafasc> if you're thinking git in terms of "download" and "upload" you'll have a very bad experience.
