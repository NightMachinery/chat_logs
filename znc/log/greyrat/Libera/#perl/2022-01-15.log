[07:44:23] <ether> I'm in hte middle of re-reading David Weber's Honor Harrington series. the first book is "On Basilisk Station". it's space navy stuff, military and political with very little alien stuff
[07:45:18] <ether> with realistic navy battles, with "point blank range" on the order of 100,000 km, rather than the meters that star trek plays around with

[08:24:35] <aquanight> Never mind to the next one over.
[08:24:36] <xenu> a debugging session on #win32 made me realize that DynaLoader is insane
[08:24:46] <aquanight> xenu: oh?
[08:25:12] <xenu> and XSLoader is insane too because it fallbacks to DynaLoader when it fails to load the dll and thus inherits the insane behaviour
[08:25:28] * aquanight blinks
[08:25:37] <xenu> i will probably write an even simpler replacement that never does any "DWIM" fallbacks ever tomorrow
[08:26:00] <xenu> tl;dr someone had an xs module installed (DBD::MariaDB) but without the xs part
[08:26:02] <aquanight> what about dynaloader is insane in a win32 context
[08:26:19] <aquanight> ... right. so it should fail to load?
[08:26:20] <xenu> i don't know how it happened, but that doesn't matter
[08:26:58] <xenu> and it turns out dynaloader has "helpful" fallbacks and it tries really hard to load *some* dll when it can't find the right one
[08:27:06] <xenu> and it will happily venture outside @INC
[08:27:11] <aquanight> wat
[08:27:12] <xenu> to find it
[08:27:19] <aquanight> *how*
[08:27:34] <aquanight> or is this the win32 thing where it'll start searching %PATH%
[08:28:16] <xenu> 00:27 < xenu> oh, it seems i missed a fallback, when the dll isn't found in @INC, it tries directories from $Config{libpth}, the env variable named in $Config{ldlibpthname} (it's usually empty) and $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
[08:28:30] <xenu> and to make things worse
[08:28:57] <xenu> it doesn't just try Module.xs.dll but a few other names such as libmodule.dll which doesn't make any sense
[08:30:15] <xenu> this is bonkers, it's the worst kind of DWIM

[08:34:04] <aquanight> return LoadLibraryExA(PerlDir_mapA(filename), NULL, LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH);
[08:34:22] <aquanight> I think I remember this flag doing a thing
[08:35:07] <xenu> that probably shouldn't matter, dynaloader mostly tries to use absolute paths
[08:35:30] <xenu> all that insanity is completely self-inflicted
[08:35:40] <sivoais>  wow, that's... terrrible. What could ever have used that dwimmery as a "feature"?
[08:38:20] <xenu> there was a period when people thought it's a good idea
[08:38:36] <aquanight> xenu: ... you ready for some win32 WTFery? LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH *requires* an absolute path (and causes the function to fallback to system directories and PATH if it's not there)
[08:40:20] <aquanight> the search order under LOAD_WITH_ALTERED is: the provided directory, ., System32, SYSTEM (16-bit DLLs), Windows, %PATH%
[08:40:54] <aquanight> I don't know about the name mutations
[08:42:12] <aquanight> I'm thinking perl probably should not be specifying LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH for DynaLoader
[08:43:16] <xenu> i believe dynaloader calls dynaloader only when it knows that the library exists, so it shouldn't matter
[08:43:32] <xenu> er
[08:43:36] <xenu> calls loadlibrary*
[08:43:45] <sivoais> Since we're on linking + MSWin32, I have several downstream deps that need to have EUMM :nosearch ... :search on MSWin32 since those are likely only using DLLs (especially under MSYS2)
[08:43:50] <xenu> all that searching i've described is done at perl level
[08:45:43] <sivoais> sorry, upstream, not downstream
[08:46:22] *** Joins: swaggboi (~swaggboi@slackware.uk/supporter/swaggboi)
[08:46:24] <sivoais>  I add this in myself by using a hack -- have not suggested this to those upstream. Would having EUMM try to just use -lname be too big of a change?
[08:47:20] <aquanight> xenu: that's a fair point: ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH affects dependency loading so it might be needed for that purpose
[08:49:00] <aquanight> xenu: ah: dl_findfile
[08:49:27] <xenu> sivoais: i don't quite understand, you want :nosearch to become the default? i used to think it's a good idea but apparently, the point of the current behaviour is that people use LIBS to list *candidates*
[08:50:12] <xenu> which is weird but i guess it's too late to change that
[08:51:59] <aquanight> xenu: oh god it's worse
[08:52:02] <sivoais> yeah, it's especially weird in a world where the flags come from pkg-config or some other *-config tool
[08:52:18] <aquanight> push(@names,"$_.$dl_so")     unless m/\.$dl_so$/o;
[08:52:24] <aquanight> A) m//o
[08:52:46] <aquanight> B) no \Q \E around an externally sourced variable interpolated into a regex
[08:53:48] <xenu> i'm not sure if %Config counts as externally sourced :P
[08:54:03] <aquanight> I say it does
[08:54:32] <aquanight> well

[08:55:49] <xenu> anyway, my xsloader which i will definitely write tomorrow because it pissed me off, will just search @INC and only use the right name (Module.$Config{dlext}) 
[08:55:55] <xenu> and it will *never* fall back to dynaloader
[08:56:41] <aquanight> I thought xsloader was just a fancy wrapper around dynaloader
[08:56:55] <aquanight> I'm now more confused than ever
[08:57:03] <xenu> xsloader is basically a much simpler dynaloader which fall backs to dynaloader on error
[08:57:24] <sivoais> will you support dl_load_flags() ?
[08:57:50] <xenu> okay, to clarify, let's treat the perl and xs parts of dynaloader separately
[08:57:55] <aquanight> so the relevant values in this case are hardcoded into Config.pm, presumably written by the build procedure
[08:58:17] <xenu> xs parts of dynaloader (the wrapper around dlopen/loadlibrary) are unavoidable
[08:58:22] <xenu> my beef is with the perl part
[08:58:32] *** Quits: kitsunenokenja (~kitsunech@68.91.220.96) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[09:01:35] <aquanight> I'm guessing here but I wonder if it's because DynaLoader was sorta intended to be a "generic" C-lib loader
[09:01:57] <aquanight> so it follows logic trees more appropriate to a general purpose object loader rather than specifically for XS
[09:02:04] <xenu> sivoais: i don't know yet, i will decide tomorrow
[09:02:13] <aquanight> it just so happens that the only real perl can actually *do* anything with it is if said module has any XS to it
[09:03:10] <aquanight> I suppose it's not impossible to DynaLoader in something, said something uses a DllMain (or whatever ld-linux.so's version is...) and can then call back into perl
[09:03:47] <aquanight> plus I imagine shit like Inline::C or some FFI mechanism could leverage DynaLoader without an XS target
[09:05:26] <aquanight> xenu: now that I think about it
[09:05:38] <aquanight> is it actually required for the XS objects to be stuffed in @INC?
[09:06:36] <xenu> well it clearly isn't required because dynaloader will find them anyway
[09:06:44] <xenu> but that's what EU::MM and M::B do
[09:07:17] <xenu> and if someone has their own private darkpan modules that rely on that stupid behaviour it's their problem
[09:07:36] <aquanight> I was thinking more about system distributions
[09:07:51] <aquanight> deciding for whatever reason that "thou shalt not have .so outside /lib"
[09:08:19] <aquanight> an entirely unreasonable position to assert really and I doubt anyone actually does it
[09:09:47] <aquanight> and if someone does that and somehow has problems, it's a problem easily solved with this little thing called 'ln -s'

[17:04:14] <pragma-> I don't understand the hype surrounding NFTs. At one point, some major video game publisher was going to somehow add NFTs as in-game cosmetics? Makes no sense to me.
[17:05:44] <heiner__> It's a way to monetarize non-physical things like software or images that otherwise could easily be copied
[17:05:49] <pragma-> I suspect it's all just a money laundering/tax evasion scheme. I have a feeling that the video game studio was just trying to bandwagon onto a "popular" thing.
[17:06:41] <simcop2387> huf: less greebles and more, "i just pooped" zoomies
[17:07:11] <simcop2387> huf: it's kinda fun watching him climb/jump up a 7 foot cat tree in less than 2 seconds too.
[17:07:20] <pragma-> What's the "otherwise", though? They're still easily copyable. Just now one guy has a certificate (more like a receipt) that says he spent money on it.
[17:07:32] <heiner__> well, I wouldn't say money landering. If somebody creates e. g. a digital image, he can now sell the *first*, "original" version as a NFT, never minding the digital copies others will make
[17:07:50] <simcop2387> i've got some other cameras to add to my system on the way (some espcam32's with ov2640 modules) to throw into frigate and add to his trees
