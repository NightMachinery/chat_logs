[01:20:10] <JakeSays> i assume double data rate?
[01:20:15] <JakeSays> ah
[01:20:38] <JakeSays> so what changes with each version?
[01:20:45] <JakeSays> aside from the version #:p
[01:21:38] <Suchiman> JakeSays: the improvement from SD RAM (Single Data Rate) to DDR RAM was obviously double the data rate :P "In computing, a computer bus operating with double data rate (DDR) transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal"
[01:21:56] <JakeSays> ah
[01:22:05] <JakeSays> well, qdr will never happen then
[01:22:06] <Suchiman> newer generations of DDR memory just spec out higher frequencies (megatransfers), memory access latencies, etc.

[01:28:37] <bomb> kool
[01:29:02] <JakeSays> Suchiman: so it's not better than ddr?
[01:29:28] <Suchiman> JakeSays: i mean the signaling can transfer more bits at once but you can do the same with DDR by just running at much more frequency xD
[01:30:12] <JakeSays> yeah but if you could run qdr at the same freq as ddr..
[01:30:19] <JakeSays> er, odr
[01:30:30] <Suchiman> JakeSays: so much transfer rate :O
[01:32:56] <JakeSays> Suchiman: so how does GDDR differ from DDR?
[01:35:32] <Suchiman> JakeSays: dunno, but GDDR5X apparently uses QDR
[01:36:07] <JakeSays> i'll wait for FFM

[02:44:34] <entropygain> current job can be pretty laid back with the occasional crazy isht that takes full concentration .. i just dont want to have the stress of juggling 2 jobs with their own tasks etc .. potential overlapping meetings so forth
[02:44:39] <Suchiman> entropygain: tell him that for as much as the company acts in their best interest by paying you as little as they can get away with, you have to act in your best interest to make bank. You work to live, not live to work

[02:46:12] <Nasp> Some reflection is easier, like getting a list of properties or fields
[02:46:13] <Suchiman> Nasp: the code is pretty clear to me and looks correct, the only error i could see would be supplying the wrong input
[02:46:17] <entropygain> but yeah - i would be making unreal money if i held down both jobs ... could never complain about not having the opportunity to work a little extra for real good  $$$$
[02:47:24] <Suchiman> entropygain: i mean, in theory, you could take on both and see how it works out for you, possibly reduce hours you dedicate to the first employer so they don't lose your expertise but you can dedicate more time to the second job
[02:47:35] <entropygain> Suchiman: work to live, not live to work - that sounds french :rofl:
[02:47:36] <Suchiman> and if it doesn't work out you can still quit the first job
[02:48:00] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I updated the gist, it is the dbSet, if not then im' more tired than i thought i was
[02:49:17] <entropygain> i just hate to lose face and look bad if things come to that .. as in i take pride in my work and i would hate to produce half assed stuff .. even if its manageable I value freedom quite a bit

[03:00:38] <Suchiman> Nasp: and on top of that... i assume you're going to enumerate all DbSet's on the context via reflection, right? otherwise, if you're going to type it out like QueryV2.Create(context.Foo); then you could skip reflection completely like so `public static IQueryV2 Create<TEntity>(DbSet<TEntity> set) where TEntity : class => new QueryV2<TEntity>(set);`
[03:01:03] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yes planning to loop through all through reflection
[03:01:07] <Nasp> Actually that's what it already does
[03:01:10] <Nasp> It's just not typesafe
[03:01:17] <Nasp> Which caused issues during .NET 5 and .NET 6 upgrade
[03:01:41] <Suchiman> Nasp: do you actually gain speed by enumerating all DbSets instead of just one?
[03:01:54] <Nasp> Due to the V1 class constructs i like this https://gist.github.com/toftware/8d99ff502aa0e796ec8baa5426393478
[03:02:02] <JakeSays> enumerate all the things
[03:02:10] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Not sure really
[03:02:14] * Suchiman enumerates JakeSays's wrinkles
[03:02:26] <Nasp>  I would think just enumerating one DbSet pr DbContext should do it?
[03:03:12] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah, that's my strategy with EF6 since the first access is measurably slow, hitting all DbSets once only removes very little cold start penalty in comparison

[03:07:02] <Nasp> Yeah that's a big one

[03:07:36] <Suchiman> Nasp: i didn't know you could load the edmx into EF
[03:07:59] <Nasp> Probably something that needs a good benchmark to see if it makes a difference

[04:03:45] <Jonopoly> bpmedley: I think the issue is the redirect
[04:03:45] <bpmedley> Said another way, is the issue processing the request from the browser?
[04:05:11] <Jonopoly> So the issue I guess is I've created a url
[04:05:25] <Jonopoly> www.google.com -> localhost:8000/ABCDE

[04:09:18] <Jonopoly> https://pastebin.com/ebRu49JV
[04:09:46] <bpmedley> I think if you change line 7 that will help you
[04:10:09] <bpmedley> And make the default the controller that forwards the url
[04:10:48] <Jonopoly> So i've kept it in Home for now just to get it working before refactoring

[04:17:53] <bpmedley> Awesome
[04:17:56] <Jonopoly> I suppose It's okay to have multiple routes?
[04:18:11] <bomb> doesn't bother me
[04:18:26] <bpmedley> Jonopoly : If I understand your question correctly, then yes, it is.  Multiple routes is a cornerstone of ASP.Net
[04:18:55] <Jonopoly> Ah and people say "don't cut corners"

[04:29:44] <Jonopoly> I've got my two route.. but on page load It isn't going to home
[04:29:53] <bpmedley> Oh, usually we define routes in controllers..
[04:30:07] <Jonopoly> on load I want it to go to HomeController/Index
[04:30:10] <Jonopoly> Oh...
[04:30:20] <Jonopoly> Even in EntityFramework 4.8?
[04:30:44] <bpmedley> EntityFramework or ASP .Net ?
[04:30:58] <Jonopoly> Oh sorry .net framework 4.8
[04:31:01] <Jonopoly> (my bad)
[04:31:32] <bpmedley> I feel there is probably one routes.MapRoute and the rest are in the controllers

[11:54:02] <tsujp> I'm trying to enumrate the properties of a Record but.. it doesn't work? It's just a `public record` with 2 internal string types and im calling this from the same assembly: `newEnvKeypairs.GetType().GetRuntimeProperties().Where(p => p.Name != "EqualityContract").Select(p => p.GetValue(p)).ToList()` and I get `Exception of type
[11:54:03] <tsujp> 'System.Reflection.TargetException' was thrown`
[11:55:24] <tsujp> Ah...... it was because the properties were `internal`
[11:56:08] <tsujp> I thought `internal` allowed access within the same assembly (which this is, it's a record in the same file as the class that is trying to execute that statement).. what's happening here that causes that to fail?
[11:57:41] <Nasp> ap5: Ms made ikke but I can't remember it's name

[11:58:16] <ap5> That is true. I remember now!
[11:58:39] <tsujp> Okay so I can see the properties but `p.GetValue(p)` with `.ToList()` still throws a reflection error
[11:58:52] <tsujp> Isn't `p.GetValue(p)` supposed to be giving me the value of that property?
[11:59:05] <tsujp> It's giving me a `PropertyInfo` instead...

[12:48:57] <Suchiman> tsujp: \\n is how you escape \n to not mean newline in C# string literals, except in verbatim strings (the ones that start with @) where \n is taken as is without interpreting it as newline. If you have @"\n" and look at it in the debugger it would show as "\\n" (to tell you it's not an actual newline) but if you print it to the console it should stay as \n without doing a newline
[12:49:34] <Nasp> Suchiman: It just seems lazy

[19:08:45] <bomb> jonp Android Java is even worse XD
[19:09:01] <jonp> i *think* API-33 is now API compatible with JDK11?
[19:09:33] <bomb> hmm, it's stable yet? I'm still on 32
[19:10:54] <jonp> define "stable"
[19:11:01] <jonp> it has been declared API stable
[19:11:11] <jonp> but last i checked (last week?) you can't submit API-33 apps to the Play store
[19:11:20] <jonp> and no devices have it as a "stable" OS

[19:42:53] <cloudbender> This form is actually spawing a temporary thread ? ...
[19:43:01] <cloudbender> var observer = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>{})
[19:43:07] <bomb> MaNa2k which version of Android it's running?
[19:43:35] <MaNa2k> dont know, probablt not gingerbread i guess, since i have upgraded it
[19:44:00] <canton7> cloudbender, it posts that action to the thread pool, where it will be run by one of the thread pool threads
[19:44:08] <MaNa2k> or was it maybe s2 that came with ginerbread
[19:44:21] <canton7> cloudbender, use Task.Run these days, unless you have a good reason not to. It does the same thing, but removes some of the gotchas in the API
[19:44:38] <cloudbender> canton7 Thank you.
[19:45:08] <cloudbender> canton7 can I assume that the task in that form will kill it's thread on completion ?
[19:45:29] <cloudbender> Or, release the thread back to the pool ?
[19:45:58] <cloudbender> I am manually building threads, and they seem to be hanging after the app exits.
[19:48:19] <cloudbender> nvm I'll read up on the Task API
[19:49:31] *** Quits: MaNa2k (~MaNa2k@224.81-166-66.customer.lyse.net) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[19:50:19] <canton7> cloudbender, it'll probably get released back to the pool
[19:50:34] <canton7> the pool makes decisions on when to add new threads and remove unused ones
[19:50:56] <canton7> (it uses ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem under the hood: that's probably a good place to start)
[19:51:47] <cloudbender> OK perfect. I need eight by two (16) threads for 8 static b-directional streams, and if the pool manages those that's fine with me.
[19:53:02] <canton7> It is a bit slow to add new threads -- it's implementation defined, but last time I checked it can add 2 a second
[19:53:38] <canton7> So if you're going to be giving it long-running pieces of work, you're going to hit delays as it scales up. That's not what it's intended for: it's intended for very short bits of work which release the thread back quickly
[19:53:53] <cloudbender> oh.
[19:53:55] <canton7> So if your streams are async -- and so don't block the calling thread -- it's going to be fine to use the thread pool, and indeed that's what 'await' will do
[19:54:06] <canton7> But if they're blocking, you're better off creating some dedicated threads
[19:54:11] <cloudbender> hmmm
[19:54:27] <canton7> pass TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning (or whatever it is) to Task.Factory.StartNew -- that tells the TaskFactory that you're intending the hold the thread for an extended period
[19:54:41] <canton7> The result is implementation-defined, but in practice it spins up a new thread for you
[19:54:48] <cloudbender> It's a lightweight app, but it will need the streams to be more or less static during runtime.
[19:54:51] <canton7> Or you might prefer to explicitly create them, as then you can name them
[19:54:58] <cloudbender> yeah ok.
[19:55:07] <canton7> But, everything can be async these days
[19:55:24] <canton7> It would be more normal to have your streams be fully async, so they don't block. Then you can just stick them on the thread pool
[19:55:33] <biberu> (sounds like you're thinking in a thread oriented way)
[19:55:35] <cloudbender> hmmm
[19:55:40] <cloudbender> I am
[19:55:50] <canton7> Yeah, substitute out a thread, and replace it with an 'async' method
[19:56:10] <canton7> (unless you particularly need threads for a particular thread-safety scheme or something)
