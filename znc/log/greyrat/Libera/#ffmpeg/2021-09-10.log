[01:52:34] <klf> I used a desktop capturing software called vokoscreenng this morning but it crashed midway through.  It wrote everything up until the point it crashed to a file named foo.mkv
[01:53:58] <klf> now, while I can playback the file in mpv *but the length/duration of this video file is unknown to video player and video editing softwares.
[01:55:54] <klf> Is there a way to use ffmpeg repair/trancode this file such that the transcoded output file has a determined length
[01:55:57] <klf> ?
[01:56:16] <DeHackEd> if it can be done it'll just be: ffmpeg -i brokenfile.mkv -c copy newfile.mkv   # do NOT use the same file for in and out!
[01:57:35] <klf> let me tias
[01:58:04] <klf> in the meantime, let me tell you what I've tried: "ffmpeg -i vokoscreenNG-2021-09-09_10-07-16.mkv -s 1920x1080 out.mkv"

[02:04:57] <klf> okay, let's get technical here.  what is it that fixed the issue?
[02:05:19] <klf> since the stream is not actually re-encoded
[02:07:21] <klf> I guess ffmpeg just go through the stream from start to finish (EOF) w/o re-encoding, and as such it'd know the actual length of the stream
[02:07:32] <klf> goes* through
[02:10:31] <BtbN> re-encoding it will also fix it, but be a pointless waste of time and loss of quality

[08:02:18] <confuzed> hey there. I have a ffmpeg command line that accepts MPEG-TS multicast input and renders HLS output ( http://pastie.org/p/78sphXHhCZetTByYIsrVLu ). it is executing on a modern 20 core machine. if I remove '-preset veryfast', UDP fifos will overrun because output is not being generated at the source framerate. this is not a CPU consumption problem, CPU stays around 5 cores. it looks like a queueing/sync
[08:02:24] <confuzed> problem, but I'm not sure where. my guess is the filtergraph is causing a problem?
[08:02:51] <confuzed> in gstreamer, there are explicit node types you can introduce in order to ensure some part of the pipe has its own threads to execute from. i think perhaps i need something like that here, but i could not see anything like it in the filters documentation

[08:15:24] <confuzed> it appears to be due to the '-tune' setting
[08:17:47] <confuzed> yep, and 'tune zerolatency' expands to '... --sync-lookahead ... --sliced-threads', both sound pretty suspicious
[08:21:11] <furq> zerolatency for hls is probably a waste of time
[08:21:48] <furq> both metaphorically and literally on account of it's slower and worse quality
[08:25:45] <confuzed> it looks like the culprit was --sliced-threads.. will try just dropping -tune, it was cutpasted from an example basically

[20:35:52] <kepstin> 30 because that's what you input claims to be

[20:55:25] <thebombzen_> kpoman: -vsync 0 and -r are incompatible
[20:56:16] <thebombzen_> although the crash appears to be related to your input options
[20:56:34] <thebombzen_> you have a bunch of hardware accelerated decode options for the input file, which seems unnecessary since it's mjpeg
[20:57:35] <thebombzen_> that said it looks like you're running out of vram
[20:58:21] <kepstin> if this error occurs when purely using software decoder/encoder, then that rules that out.

[21:03:43] <thebombzen_> since ffmpeg doesn't have a way to do that on encoded frames
[21:04:17] <thebombzen_> I'm guessing what's happening is that it's hwdownloading it, -r 30 is inserting a fps=30 filter, which is done in software, and then it's being re-uploaded
[21:04:28] <thebombzen_> the solution here is to skip the -r 30 altogether
[21:04:47] <kepstin> the -r option does not insert an fps filter
[21:05:02] <kepstin> it's implemented directly in ffmpeg.c, i think?
[21:05:15] <kepstin> but yeah, i'm not sure exactly how it interacts with hardware transcoding
[21:05:34] <thebombzen_> but regardless of how ffmpeg.c implements it, I don't believe it works on hardware frames

[21:35:09] <JEEB> don't use zero
[21:35:16] <JEEB> if you want passthrough use the word "passthrough"
[21:35:22] <JEEB> more readable
[21:35:22] <kpoman> ok
[21:35:38] <JEEB> "vsync" is not really vsync, it's the logic within ffmpeg.c which decides whether to duplicate or drop frames
[21:35:42] <kpoman> trying "ffmpeg -i SUNP0001.AVI -vsync passthrough -f null -"
[21:35:45] <JEEB> passthrough = "don't touch"
[21:36:01] *** Quits: TheSashmo (~TheSashmo@158.106.77.7) (Quit: Leaving...)
[21:36:10] <kpoman> same thing, crash on same frame
[21:36:20] <kpoman> SUNP0001.AVI: Cannot allocate memory
[21:37:03] <JEEB> interesting
[21:37:09] <JEEB> is it possible to share that sample?
[21:37:19] <JEEB> to see if it's broken or something else
[21:37:26] <kpoman>  the video is huge (thats why I try to transcode it)
[21:37:36] <kpoman> 2974106624 bytes
[21:38:02] <JEEB> that's... 2.9GiB?
[21:38:04] <JEEB> not too bad
[21:38:24] <JEEB> when I do lossless 3D renders I handle 80GiG files for just a few minutes :)
[21:38:26] <kpoman> JEEB: well I am in Brasilia, it does take a day or so

[21:38:42] <kpoman> in best scenario I get 10Mbps upling
[21:38:43] <kpoman> k
[21:38:49] <JEEB> so it's not the file size
[21:38:52] <JEEB> unless your distro is buggy
[21:39:09] <kpoman> my computer has 32GB of ram
[21:39:22] <kpoman> mint updated to latest packages
[21:39:47] <kpoman> this binary is statically linked so it doesnt even touch at my distro, right ?
[21:40:10] <JEEB> it still touches the kernel etc
[21:40:17] <JEEB> but it's not my first guess
[21:40:32] <JEEB> my first guess is that there's something funky with that file, which is not the file size
[21:40:39] <kpoman> ok at least nothing in syslog/dmesg
[21:40:51] <JEEB> if you want to figure out how far into the file the issue is, you can then cut that AVI with dd
[21:41:02] <kpoman> JEEB: do you think I may test it with other mpeg tool ?
[21:41:30] <kpoman> JEEB: or is there a command that only analyses the file and no transcoding/whatever done ?
[21:42:05] *** Quits: TheSashmo (~TheSashmo@158.106.77.7) (Client Quit)
[21:42:18] <JEEB> something AVI specific is probably there, then there's ffprobe which can output a JSON log of all the packets
[21:42:35] <JEEB> but I think it's simplest if you can figure out how far into the file the ~7000 frames are
[21:43:05] <JEEB> `dd if=INPUT.avi bs=1M count=20 | ffmpeg -v verbose -i - -f null -`
[21:43:07] <JEEB> try this
[21:43:14] <JEEB> this is the first 20 MiB
[21:43:30] <JEEB> you can adjust the count until it exits
[21:43:37] <JEEB> then you know how many megabytes
