[19:34:39] <Bayes> thoughts on gradient based kernel dimension reduction ?
[19:36:52] <Bayes> "The gradient-based kernel dimension reduction technique is chosen due to its ability to drastically decrease dimensionality with little loss in information" https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1090648
[19:37:37] <Bayes> Im still thinking I should invest some time into PLS
[19:37:55] <Bayes> the whole dimension reduction thingie that doesn't care about the output/response is ... uhmmm

[20:15:56] <Bayes> also, I attended a 3-hour breakout where about 15 people would give a 10 min talk on their work. We were asked to provide anonymous feedback, one positive and one negative comment, for each presenter. I got loads of good feedback, I was surprised that "forced" feedback was so pertinent and helpful.
[20:17:43] <Bayes> basically everyone was like "nice plots but I didn't get a thing about the introduction / specific problem"
[20:18:01] <Bayes> which is what I really went for, by design, though in hindsight that mighta been a poor choice
[20:19:06] <Bayes> with only 10 minutes, I decided that I'd focus mostly on bayesian methodology which was the common theme across presentations
[20:20:20] <Bayes> so my take away is... I need to find more efficient ways to explain the specific problem in approximately the same time I allocated to the intro
[20:20:31] <Bayes> which probably boils down to "more figures!"
[20:22:38] <h_m> is your research about figures that it cannot be described without them?
[20:23:11] <Bayes> no, it's not about figures
[20:23:15] <Bayes> it can be described with them
[20:23:36] <Bayes> how much math do you want to throw in a 10 minute presentation?
[20:24:12] <mefistofeles> depends on the audience and the message I guess
[20:25:00] <Bayes> you can spend say, a minute or two introducing your specific problem (in this case atmospheric stuff) to a crew of statisticians
[20:25:23] <Bayes> so in the end... you cannot really explain much in detail what's going on in atmospheric terms, even if you knew it well,
[20:25:48] <Bayes> so you gotta motivate your statistical methodology without delving too much into atmospheric science and remote sensing
[20:26:21] <Bayes> and then jump on the statistical methodology itself, model, prior elicitation, model tuning, validation, etc
[20:27:38] <Bayes> so the key I'm thinking, again in hindsight, is that one should give a concise introduction to motivate that (a) your methodology is very pertinent to specific situation, and (b) none of the developed methodology quite fits what you need so you're gonna create something new.
[20:28:45] <h_m> it sounds like you were presenting everything you have done on the research to date...so you spent most time on the interesting stuff?
[20:29:43] <Bayes> yep
[20:29:55] <Bayes> and the introduction being lacking was just a side effect

[20:30:50] <Bayes> but my take away is that I want to spend some time thinking on how to be more efficient when introducing the topic, that is not allocating more time for the introduction but using the time better
[20:33:33] <h_m> true. or focus on a particular aspect of the research rather than everything.
[20:33:57] <Bayes> oh yeah, this was just a narrow window on one specific aspect
[20:36:23] <h_m> i also wonder whether anonymity made the feedback better compared to say engaging you directly after/during the presentation
