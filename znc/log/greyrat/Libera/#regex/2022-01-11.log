[02:57:52] <shailangsa> does anybody know if it's possible to list all sentences which occur most than once in a txt file in regex or other like notepad++?
[03:04:31] <mysticspiral[m]> if you have a file where each sentence is a line you can easily pipe it throug sort and uniq on linux
[03:07:22] <shailangsa> is it possible to list where parts of lines are repeating like https://pastebin.com/4s3t4YJq where only the timestamp is different?
[03:11:05] <mysticspiral[m]> please post the example text again without word-wraping newlines
[03:11:44] <shailangsa> ?
[03:12:01] <shailangsa> how
[03:12:38] <mysticspiral[m]> CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE "/vendor/bin/h
[03:12:38] <mysticspiral[m]> w/vendor.mediatek.hardware.mms@1.1-service"
[03:12:45] <mysticspiral[m]> this should be one line for example
[03:12:51] <mysticspiral[m]> at your source
[03:13:15] <shailangsa> ?
[03:14:01] <shailangsa> 01-10 22:09:39.045   655   655 F linker  : CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE "/vendor/bin/hw/vendor.mediatek.hardware.mms@1.1-service": cannot locate symbol "_ZN7android8hardware7details14gServiceSidMapE" referenced by "/vendor/lib64/vendor.mediatek.hardware.mms@1.1.so"...
[03:14:23] <mysticspiral[m]> use the pastebin please
[03:14:59] <shailangsa> i already did previously where it word wraps it?
[03:15:36] <mysticspiral[m]> you understand the difference right?
[03:15:46] <mysticspiral[m]> best would be if you post the whole source text into the pastebin
[03:16:26] <mysticspiral[m]> what's the source of the text?
[03:18:10] <shailangsa> https://pastebin.com/0EKpGFBR
[03:18:41] <mysticspiral[m]> yes thats better
[03:22:25] <shailangsa> is it possible to list all duplicate groups of strings without explicity searching for "vendor.mediatek.hardware.mms" and "vendor.mediatek.hardware.pq"?
[03:27:06] <mysticspiral[m]> do those duplicates always occur directly underneath the other?
[03:30:36] <mysticspiral[m]> if yes then this could work
[03:30:38] <mysticspiral[m]> https://regex101.com/r/NreCXz/1
[03:32:10] <shailangsa> no in the source , they are occuring at different timestamps, hence a difference of few hundred lines on the android logs
[03:33:17] <mysticspiral[m]> it would be easier for me if i could have a copy of the text you want the regex on

[04:34:10] <mysticspiral[m]> only applied on a small portion on the file
[04:36:50] <shailangsa> hmm but this may not work because the target string i.e "vendor.mediatek.hardware.mms" and "vendor.mediatek.hardware.pq" may not always be after a timestamp, some lines may not have a timestamp, is it possible to just have a sort or filter where notepad++ just lists how many times a sentence or string occurs?
[04:38:22] *** Joins: r3m (~launch@user/r3m)
[04:38:33] <mysticspiral[m]> i probably misunderstood what you are looking for
[04:41:36] <mysticspiral[m]> lets start from the beginning
[04:42:06] <mysticspiral[m]> so you have those two strings "vendor.mediatek.hardware.mms" and "vendor.mediatek.hardware.pq"
[04:42:11] <mysticspiral[m]> what about them?
[04:43:44] <shailangsa> not just those strings, there are several different namespaces like the above and some standalone strings in the logs, and i want to know which ones occur more than once
[04:45:49] <mysticspiral[m]> you cant possibly want any deliberate string that somehow occurs again somewhere else. so you got to be more specific about the nature of the pattern

[16:00:49] <mysticspiral[m]> 12 of them are just empty lines. the other 3 are the 'beginning of' lines
[16:01:38] <mysticspiral[m]> the commandline does the following:
[16:08:08] <mysticspiral[m]> first it it prefixes every line with the line number. then it will sort all lines, but by using an offset 18+15 starting from the timestamp. that means it will ignore the first 33 characters of each original line for the sorting. since the 'beginning of' lines are shorter than that, they are considered empty lines and are sorted with the other empty lines
[16:11:25] <mysticspiral[m]> then the uniq command takes over and groups together all lines that are the same after the offset, deleting any line that is uniq
[16:13:14] <mysticspiral[m]> its also possible to include unique lines, having them appear as a single-item group

[18:53:38] <mysticspiral[m]> maybe he wants this? https://regex101.com/r/atWJWp/5
[18:54:19] <OnlineCop> Is Spyder using PowerShell for its regex parsing? That would be a .NET variant.
[18:54:42] <re101-zonkey-15> no
[18:54:47] <re101-zonkey-15> it is spyder
[18:54:50] <OnlineCop> Yeah, version /5 might be pretty good.
[18:54:52] <re101-zonkey-15> it did not work

[18:55:26] <re101-zonkey-15> that is what I am using
[18:55:27] <OnlineCop> Spyder IDE?
[18:55:52] <re101-zonkey-15> Spyder 5.0.5
[18:55:57] <OnlineCop> Maybe you have a link to Spyder's official page containing its regex syntax? I see multiple results for "spyder regex".
[18:56:34] <OnlineCop> Does your text end in \r, \r\n, or \n ?
[18:57:20] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/atWJWp/6
[18:57:58] <OnlineCop> If it's looking for "\n\n" but your text contains '\r\n' line endings, it would have to change to look for "\r\n\r\n" instead.
[18:57:59] <re101-zonkey-15> it ends with several things, it;s not fixed
[18:58:09] <OnlineCop> Does it ever end in '\r\r' ?
[18:58:21] <OnlineCop> Almost no formats do anymore (VERY old Mac formats).
[18:58:29] <re101-zonkey-15> no
[18:58:44] <re101-zonkey-15> the first line ends by enter

[18:59:33] <mysticspiral[m]> OnlineCop: wouldnt that be just a single \r?

[19:00:22] <mysticspiral[m]> the very old mac format
[19:00:57] <OnlineCop> Ah; very old Mac formats used CR (\r) so in that case, re101-zonkey-15 would probably need 2x of those: \r\r
[19:01:08] <OnlineCop> But you're right: CR would be just \r.
[19:01:54] <OnlineCop> In the last 15 years, though, Apple changed their defaults to be more Unix/Linux compatible with just using LF (\n) so we didn't need a whole /\r?\n|\r/ solution to handle all the various line endings.

[19:07:43] <OnlineCop> Well, that one is fairly easy to change. They might still store the measurements out to disk in one format, but when reading it back in, they may convert it on the fly.
[19:07:50] <mysticspiral[m]> berlin
[19:09:14] <OnlineCop> My company just changed the units its JSON read in (mm to cm, inches to cm, [0..100] percentages to [0..1] proportions, etc.), and some of our systems simply weren't retooled to handle the conversion. So read/write of those same fields did on-the-fly (or is it now called JIT?) conversions so the file format wouldn't get messed up.
