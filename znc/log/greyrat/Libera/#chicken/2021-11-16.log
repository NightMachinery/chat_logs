[00:07:34] <mangol> corporate politics is distinct from organizational politics in general, and from society-wide politics
[00:09:15] <Zipheir> Perhaps so.
[00:10:26] <mangol> torvalds is now involved in corporate politics against his will, and like many/most makers who find themselves in that situation, is visibly out of his depth
[00:14:48] <fantazo> What is the source of politics in corporations? What need does this fulfill?
[00:15:01] <mangol> money and power
[00:15:38] <fantazo> so egoistical gain?
[00:15:41] <mangol> yes
[00:16:10] <Bunny351> influence and attention
[00:16:16] <mangol> one of the less clandestinely darwinian spheres of society
[00:17:45] <mangol> the people who are only after influence and attention tend to be more benevolent than the pure money/power types, and the former are abused by the latter
[00:18:50] <mangol> fame involves revealing yourself, which is detrimental to long-term money/power gains
[00:19:47] <Bunny351> people are not all the same, for some money and power is the way to more attention, others like to stay in the background.
[00:44:12] <mangol> one point that's rarely discussed is that competing in "the attention economy" at all is a very vulnerable proposition, and from a security perspective it's better to control that game from behind
[00:45:31] <Bunny351> branson and bezos seem to love it (attention)
[00:47:25] <mangol> yes. that weakness may rule them out of the inner circle forever.
[00:47:40] <mangol> the mainstream social status hierarchy tends to form around attention, but the power brokers have their own internal hierarchy

[07:34:00] <foggynight> Hey, I'm working on a project which is currently spread across a bunch of source files, and uses "unit"/"uses" to access functions in other source files. Two questions: Is this the wrong way to write a chicken scheme program over multiple source files (from what I've seen online just "include"-ing seems more common)? And, how do I write a chicken egg file for this? I'm currently just using a
[07:34:01] <foggynight> makefile, and I'm having a hard time figuring out the right way to write an egg definition for this program.

[17:12:30] <sjors_> When I try to install modules on Windows I get errors because the scripts use ¨cp¨ (not supported by Powershell). I guess I should run the command in a bash shell, but I get permission issues there that I don´t know how to solve. Does anyone have experience with this / advice?
[17:13:05] <sjamaan> sjors_: Have you tried 5.3.0rc4?
[17:13:18] <sjamaan> We've solved a few issues with the different Windows flavours in it
[17:13:32] <sjamaan> We should really just cut a release already
[17:13:39] <wasamasa> yeah
[17:13:55] <wasamasa> I could do another mingw/cygwin test
[17:14:08] <sjamaan> I'd appreciate it
[17:14:25] <sjors_> I guess I´ll install it manually because: ¨chicken v5.2.0.6 is the latest version available based on your source(s).¨ in Chocolatey
[17:14:48] <sjamaan> yeah that's required for now, until we make a proper release
[17:16:53] <sjamaan> You can find the tarball at https://code.call-cc.org/dev-snapshots/2021/10/06/chicken-5.3.0rc4.tar.gz
[17:21:18] <wasamasa> thing is, I've never run into the issues that prompted the other release candidates

[17:22:05] <wasamasa> you're building a release tarball, right
[17:22:13] <wasamasa> not from a git checkout?
[17:22:41] <sjors_> I guess I downloaded the wrong thing indeed
[17:23:26] <sjors_> I used your link and it seems to be working now
[17:23:31] <sjamaan> sjors_: Also check README when in doubt
[17:23:40] <sjamaan> It has some important instructions, especially for Windows
[17:23:44] <wasamasa> yeah
[17:23:44] <sjors_> I was looking at the README but I had just downloaded the wrong thing
[17:29:20] <s-liao> wasamasa I tried to install expeditor module in ChezScheme, and experience the functionalities. But have not success it yet.
[17:30:27] <s-liao> Is it a good option to port that module to Chicken implementation?
[17:31:00] <wasamasa> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:31:03] <wasamasa> I haven't used it either
[17:32:40] <sjors_> Every chicken install command currently returns the same
[17:32:41] <sjors_> fetching simple-sha1
[17:32:41] <sjors_> Error: extension or version not found: "simple-sha1"
[17:34:01] <wasamasa> something about the installation is broken
[17:36:37] <wasamasa> lol, I tried out the vanilla behavior of the chez-scheme repl and just hitting M-f/M-b and C-M-f/C-M-b a few times breaks it
[17:37:53] <wasamasa> using ((foo bar baz) (qux quux)) as an example
[17:37:59] <wasamasa> it's tricky to reproduce though
[17:40:07] <s-liao> They said that installing this module relate to machine type as the building is based on the lib ncurses .But I have not heard about this in gambit.
[17:41:15] <s-liao> https://www.scheme.com/csug8/use.html#./use:h2
[17:42:00] <s-liao> https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/issues/591
[17:48:17] <s-liao> Even M-f/M-b and C-M-f/C-M-b can not. we can try like the project sasagawa888/eisl/, highlight the match parentheses for one sexp?
[17:56:29] <wasamasa> why is there a need to install anything?
[17:56:52] <wasamasa> the expression editor is enabled by default
[17:57:48] <wasamasa> if it isn't, your chez installation might have been built without ncurses support, yes
[17:57:53] <wasamasa> but this isn't the channel to figure that out
[17:58:38] *** Joins: klovett (~klovett@166.205.90.177)
[17:58:40] <wasamasa> I doubt eisl is worth looking at, last time I tried it out, I found lots of bugs: https://github.com/sasagawa888/eisl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Awasamasa+is%3Aclosed
[18:00:14] <wasamasa> https://github.com/sasagawa888/eisl#editable-repl doesn't list any interesting commands
[18:04:24] <wasamasa> I kind of doubt the paren highlighting is worth porting, but feel free to do that
[18:04:34] <wasamasa> I wrote a silly example of full syntax highlighting for breadline

[18:05:56] <s-liao> As in the comment section, it like that expression editor need ncurses lib. The module is built on the configuration of the machine type.

[18:08:26] <s-liao> The first time I saw the computer is AutoCAD on window95.
[18:12:19] <sjors_> Does anyone have an example of an egg that is actually available and the install command for it? I think the latest version of chicken-install does not work on Windows

[18:12:47] <wasamasa> (import this)
[18:12:49] <s-liao> simplest egg
[18:12:53] <wasamasa> > this is bullshit.

[18:13:17] <s-liao> Yeah. Just this line

[18:18:28] <sjors_> chicken-install -version
[18:18:29] <sjors_> 5.3.0rc4
[18:18:42] <wasamasa> yup, broken
[18:19:13] <wasamasa> I wish it were easier to diagnose why, other than pulling out strace/truss/procmon/...
[18:19:46] <sjors_> thanks anyway
[18:20:18] <sjors_> I understand since Windows is so different from all the other supported systems
[18:21:03] <wasamasa> procmon is the windows one
[18:21:17] <s-liao> download the eggs manually
[18:21:50] <wasamasa> it allows you to tell what the program does, like trying to open certain files or sockets or whatever
[18:22:09] <wasamasa> and not just for that program, it works system-wide
[18:22:15] <wasamasa> unlike strace and truss
[18:23:58] <s-liao> I mean that it might relate to download the egg
[18:24:02] <dstolfa_> wasamasa: depending on your system, you can use dtrace or bpftrace (the latter being more annoying to set up, but worth doing if you're stuck with linux)
[18:24:16] <dstolfa_> that way you can avoid all the noise that strace and truss produce
[18:24:44] <wasamasa> sure, but honestly, I rarely need these tools anyway
[18:25:14] <wasamasa> on windows there's more of a need because it's an overall intransparent, badly performing piece of shit
[18:25:44] <dstolfa_> i am told that windows has dtrace, but i have never tried using it
