[17:38:05] <SpaceVimBot_> <grafcube:matrix.org> hi. I am currently trying to make the debug layer use vimspector instead of vim-debug based on a setting in `init.toml`. All the configs and mappings are working correctly.
[17:38:08] <SpaceVimBot_> <grafcube:matrix.org> I am now trying to set up transient mode for it. I can't find any documentation about the dict to pass to `state.defind_keys`. Can anyone point me to some documentation?
[17:38:12] <SpaceVimBot_> <grafcube:matrix.org> thanks in advance
[17:38:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <grafcube:matrix.org> i am very new to vimscript
