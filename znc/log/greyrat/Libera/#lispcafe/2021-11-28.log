[01:52:11] <gilberth> hayley: You cheated? The olde trick to just match the units and then guess the actual formula from that?
[01:52:35] <hayley> Yes.
[01:52:43] <semz> I've seen some statically typed languages (probably Haskell) put units into the type system to prevent unit errors
[01:53:00] <semz> was a pretty cute proof of concept, but I'm not sure how nice this would be in practice
[01:53:23] <hayley> Java has pluggable types (put types in annotations, have external program check them) and those include units IIRC 
[01:53:25] <selwyn> hm
[01:53:49] <selwyn> one issue is that the notion of unit is somewhat subjective and can vary from problem to problem
[01:54:07] <hayley> https://www.lexspoon.org/expannots/
[01:54:17] <selwyn> i.e. in fluid dynamics you sometimes decouple length into units of 'height' and 'depth'
[01:55:56] <gilberth> At one physics test I was asked for the magnetic field strength of a given Helmholz coil. We were allowed to use our little booklet of formulas. However, I never used it, as I remembered all the formulas. I went on to calculate a curve integral essentially. I was not supposed to know what a curve integral is, which didn't bother me.

[02:00:29] <gilberth> Well we had, but those were not mandatory.

[02:07:56] <gilberth> semz: Grade inflation was not yet an issue in the 90s.
[02:09:35] <gilberth> A few years ago they officially modified grades at grammar school, so what was a 2 (B) before, now is a 1 (A). All shifted by one grade. That's inflation.

[06:18:09] <moon-child> huh, interesting
[06:18:27] <moon-child> apparently simd instructions have much lower latency on intel chips than others
[06:18:39] <hayley> gilberth: OTOH, no, I can't handle [\"] because I know you'll have different derivatives. So we have to check for either separately.
[06:18:44] <hayley> [\"] rather
[06:26:38] <hayley> You'd also want to know how long strings are; I'd wager most are <32 bytes and thus waste vector ops and all the shuffling involved.
[06:27:09] <hayley> Again, hence why I'm hoping to get a decent model to help make these decisions.
[06:37:23] <moon-child> most strings are probably not escaped either.  So then you just need one access and no extra logic to find the length
[06:37:41] <moon-child> orthodoxy afaik is that it is worth it to trade away branches for extra overlapping memory accesses

[07:16:57] <gilberth> About '\' and '"'. It's fastest to have two categories in a scanner. One for ["][^\"]*["], which when matched could take the buffer subseq as the value read as there is no escaping. And to have another category for ["]([^\"]|[\].)*["] and just leave the escape processing then to a processor afterwards, which will be slow, but most strings won't have escapes. Both REs are to be matched at the same time.
[07:17:47] <gilberth> hayley: Nice. Quite nice.
[07:19:25] <hayley> And still only 1,768 LOC apparently.

[21:09:59] <ln43> xd
[21:10:21] <ln43> i was impressed by the way that guy writes anyways
[21:13:22] <ln43>  also the idea to include a map editor even if not fully working...
[21:18:08] <ln43> ah no...

[23:03:26] <Jacobis9000> Hello :)
[23:03:53] <selwyn> hi
[23:04:06] <Jacobis9000> Hey selwyn, how are you?
[23:04:13] <selwyn> not bad
[23:04:18] *** Joins: waleee (~waleee@2001:9b0:216:8200:d457:9189:7843:1dbd)
[23:04:21] <selwyn> doing a lot of flashcard practice rn
[23:04:35] <Jacobis9000> What are you learning?
[23:05:10] <selwyn> turkish vocabulary
[23:05:22] <selwyn> i missed a day and now i have to do 1000 or it will pile up even more
[23:05:48] <selwyn> would still recommend this for anyone who wants to learn anything
[23:09:19] *** Joins: v3gajerusalem (~v3ga@2600:1702:ad0:3b90::40)
[23:10:25] <selwyn> how are you?
[23:10:35] <shka> ok, so i will have to implement histogram building code into cl-ds
[23:10:48] <Jacobis9000> I'm very well thanks :)
[23:11:15] <shka> and with that I can implement the remaining part of the lightgbm algorithm
[23:11:25] <shka> namely: feature bundling
[23:11:43] <ln43> what does lightgbm stands for?
[23:11:57] <shka> light gradient boosting model i suppose 
[23:12:33] <shka> i think I will gonna use this code as a reference implementation https://github.com/mergeconflict/histogram/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mergeconflict/histogram/Histogram.java
[23:12:34] -ixelp- histogram/Histogram.java at master ¬∑ mergeconflict/histogram ¬∑ GitHub
[23:16:35] <shka> with that, i will be able to implement histogram splitter for statistical-learning 
[23:18:53] <shka> and streaming histograms are honestly pretty useful on their own
[23:22:39] <shka> so that is my plan for the incoming week
[23:22:44] <shka> wish me luck
[23:23:00] <selwyn> is this for work? did you join the new guy?
[23:23:12] <shka> no, this is me being bored 
[23:23:48] <shka> hayley is doing regexs, gilberth weird hardware, i am doing data structures and machine learning 
[23:24:09] <shka> everyone has a hobby here i guess :-)
[23:26:18] <ln43> yes i was trying to run games but all the interesting ones are not building
[23:28:30] <ln43> anyway looking at the code of that doom based game i liked it more than the quake's replicas that are all not working... : /
[23:32:33] <ln43> regarding histograms i liked the idea to represent bars on the earth globe (https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/globe)
[23:33:04] <ln43> ok, maybe isn't so useful for all the cases of course
[23:34:19] <Jacobis9000> I am doing CL Gentle Intro
[23:35:09] <Jacobis9000> I can't think of a way to use AND instead of OR in this function so I am going to look at the answer
[23:36:33] <ln43> https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/book.pdf <- this one ?
[23:38:24] <Jacobis9000> oh wow the implementation they have suggested as the answer to this I would never have thought of, (not (and (not (member 'the s)) (not (member 'a s)) (not member 'an s)))))
[23:38:47] <Jacobis9000> Too many nots!
[23:40:05] <selwyn>  making my first batch of kefir now
[23:40:14] <selwyn> thats my new hobby
