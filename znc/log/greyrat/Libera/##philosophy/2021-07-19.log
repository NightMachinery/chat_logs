[17:43:59] <HvszrStykp> The technique that is learned can be pretty amazon though. And the struggle over hundreds of hours can be seen as a metaphor. The game is impartial but unfair, and even if you do everything perfectly you have no guarantee to reach your achievement. You have to perform it perfectly dozens of times until everything comes together to finally reach the goal.
[17:44:16] <HvszrStykp> pretty amazing* I guess I visit amazon too much.
[17:46:44] <HvszrStykp> Ultimately, in the case of speedrunning, I think it is the social hierarchy of the subculture's community that provides the ultimate drive to compete for the glory of achievement.

[21:41:55] <arryana> i have no idea what tnat sentence is supposed to mean
[21:42:29] <spruit11> if you take that a majority of women aim for a minority of men,  then those men 'need'  to cheat
[21:42:42] <biys> haha i've heard this before
[21:42:45] <biys> i can't remember where though
[21:43:00] <arryana> that doesn't make sense
[21:43:03] <spruit11> it seems consistent
[21:43:27] <arryana> and i don't believe that 'a majority of women aim for a minority of men' anymore than the reverse is true
[21:43:56] <pussipupu> Was it an actual biologist or Jordan Choprason?

[21:50:45] <arryana> no thanks, it sounds like a lot of hooey
[21:51:10] <spruit11> have it your way.  I don't think it's relevant anyway
[21:53:49] <biys> spruit11: i think it was something along the lines of marketting associations
[21:54:12] <biys> women are taught and told that they want a man to look a certain way and dress a certain way and make a certain amount of money and drive a certain type of car
[21:54:41] <spruit11> yah,  was other stuff with me
[21:54:43] <biys> same with men though
[21:55:27] <biys> so lets assume that all women look to obtain the reality of the image they're being marketted i'd conclude what you're saing is somewhat accurate
[21:55:51] <biys> but women and men settle all the time
[21:57:13] <biys> i would also say that traditional family values have been eroded though...  the swipe life definitely exists.  along with the womens empowerment initiatives

[22:16:51] <econo> probably. I remember liking the intro on his methodology. It was about the brain and human behavior
[22:18:24] <pussipupu> Might well be the book of the course then, broadly at least
[22:19:09] <pussipupu> There's lots on various levels of analysis in the course, including evolutionary perspectives, neuropsychology all that good stuff
[22:19:40] <pussipupu> I particularly find interesting his tendancy to treat things not as binary but as in tension with each other

[23:23:01] <spruit11> that women are the picky group because the stakes are higher for them seems easily defensible
[23:23:49] <spruit11> and some additional conditioning,  maybe.  wasn't really true for the women I met
[23:26:32] <spruit11> or maybe I didn't notice.  most of the time I am more or less completely surprised when someone took an interest
[23:27:56] <arryana> yeah, cause every guy in a bar is fighting to go home with a fat ugly chick
[23:27:59] * arryana rolls her eyes
[23:28:17] <audrey> Stakes are higher for men? Surely the opposite?
[23:28:23] <arryana> everyone goes for the person they personally find attractive.  it isn't 'all women are picky and all men aren't' nonsense
[23:28:28] <audrey> Women are the ones who have to suffer with pregnancy, bear the child, raise the child etc.
[23:28:41] <audrey> the man's involvement in an act sexual congress is marginal
[23:29:00] <bougyman> I think that's the key.
[23:29:09] <bougyman> The man's suitability as a partner to raise the child, that is.
