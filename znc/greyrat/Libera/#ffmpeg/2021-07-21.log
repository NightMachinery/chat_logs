[01:10:43] <slackbot> Is there a correct way to pass a file descriptor as a file instead of a pipe to ffmpeg? I have stdout connected to a file and was using pipe but that protocol doesn't seem to attempt to seek even though the file descriptor is a file and not a pty/pipe. I can use file:/dev/stdout and that _seems_ to work for me this time but won't work for numbered
[01:10:44] <slackbot> file descriptors generally.

[01:15:38] <kepstin> on linux, you can use the psuedo-files /dev/fd/N to name arbitrary numbered file descriptors

[02:01:48] <patiga> I'm trying to stream my desktop point to point to another person, however I get very low fps when I also capture audio using pulse
[02:01:53] <patiga> (I call it via python,) this line makes the difference between easily >60 fps and 2-3 fps "-f", "pulse", "-i", "streamsink.monitor"
[02:01:56] <patiga> iirc, it has worked before, however I don't know what changed
[02:01:59] <patiga> my full command is
[02:02:08] <patiga> ffmpeg -use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1 -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -framerate 60 -i :0.0+1920,0-f pulse -i streamsink.monitor -vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -c:a aac -b:a 160k -ar 44100 -f rtsp -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://192.168.2.160:2121
[02:03:08] <Atsuko> there should be a space before your -f
[02:03:46] <Atsuko> "-i :0.0+1920,0-f pulse" should be "-i :0.0+1920,0 -f pulse" i think
[02:04:05] <Atsuko> doubt thats causing the fps drop though
[02:05:44] <Atsuko> also is this correct "-i :0.0+1920,0"
[02:06:00] <Atsuko> like there is nothing infront of :
[02:09:05] <kepstin> that's correct for an X11 display specification
[02:09:24] <kepstin> there's an optional hostname before the : but without it you get the local host
[02:10:24] <kepstin> i don't know why you'd get fps issues with pulse + x11grab, but it might be related to input threading issues between the two inputs
[02:10:32] <kepstin> (or, rather, lack of threading)
[02:10:56] <kepstin> x11grab times frames by doing a sleep between each frame, and i'm not familiar with how the pulse input does timing
[02:12:08] <slackbot> patiga are you using pipewire by any chance?
[02:16:16] <patiga> oh thanks for all the answers
[02:16:36] <patiga> slackbot no, I haven't heard of pipewire before

[02:22:04] <patiga> kepstin I'm not very familiar with ffmpeg and pulse + x11grab is the combo that came up in the guides I used (mostly https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/StreamingGuide). If you have another combo I could try I would happily try it out :)
[02:25:31] <c_14> is the audio choppy with that command as well, or just video?
[02:25:40] <c_14> are you getting dropped frames or is everything just very behind?
[02:25:54] <c_14> have you tried using the same command but with a local file as output instead?
[02:35:13] <patiga> c_14 the audio is fluent, only ~3 seconds behind. i have dropped frames, but apart from that the video seems about synced with the sound
[02:36:52] <patiga> c_14 how do I test the third one? when I try ffmpeg -i rtsp://:2121?timeout=10 test.mp4, it directly timeouts
[02:37:36] <c_14> Hmm, have you tried removing the -use_wallclock_as_timestamps option?
[02:38:12] <patiga> today ffmpeg on the computer where I send the stream actually says it has >60 fps. last time it was >60 fps without pulse and 2-3 with pulse
[02:38:38] <patiga> I'll try that out, sec
[02:40:11] <patiga> removing that option had no effect sadly
[02:40:50] <patiga> I'll paste 2 lines of the ffmpeg output that seem interesting
[02:40:52] <patiga> [x11grab @ 0x55660fc13040] Thread message queue blocking; consider raising the thread_queue_size option (current value: 8)

[02:41:55] <patiga> hmmm I guess I could try out raisng that option
[02:42:08] <patiga> I kind of just accepted that output as the norm

[02:44:09] <c_14> Maybe add -live 1 before test.mkv
[02:45:41] <patiga> okay now I feel a little stupid, raising -thread_queue_size was apparently all that was needed and ffmpeg always told me that in the output
[02:46:04] <patiga> it seems to be working perfectly now, fluent video + audio
[02:46:19] <patiga> still, thank you very much for your help!
[02:47:22] <patiga> c_14 do you happen to know if I can somehow reduce the delay? I would like it to be as low as possible, currently its ~3 secs
[02:49:27] <c_14> With the ffmpeg CLI it's a bit difficult since there's a lot of buffers hidden around. I think there's an -fflags nobuffer maybe. Search the ffmpeg docs for "buffer"
[02:52:51] <patiga> c_14 thanks! I'll see what I can find :)

[22:54:27] <realies> i'm trying to stream the pi camera over rtmp with ffmpeg and v4l
[22:54:41] <realies> i do ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -c:v h264_v4l2m2m -b:v 8M -f flv rtmp://server/live/cam01
[22:54:51] <realies> but the receiving end (ffplay) says [h264 @ 0000022eab63e180] decode_slice_header error [h264 @ 0000022eab63e180] no frame!
[22:54:56] <realies> what might be going wrong?

[23:17:20] <realies> i've used v4l2-ctl to set fmt video width and height an pixleformat 4 (h264, compressed)
[23:17:53] <realies> when i start ffmpeg it says failed to set number of b frames, failed to set gop size, failed to sed minimum video/maximum video quantizer scale
[23:18:43] <realies> ahhh

[23:21:01] <realies> why would it still be rawvideo when i told it what fmt to use?
[23:34:11] <realies> ok made it work without using h264_v4l2m2m

[23:53:06] <realies> i figured it out, but when i try and call ffmpeg for a second time, it dies with ioctl(VIDIOC_STREAMON): Operation not permitted
[23:53:44] <BtbN> I think you are confusing decoding and encoding?
[23:54:03] <BtbN> ah, nvm, read that wrong
