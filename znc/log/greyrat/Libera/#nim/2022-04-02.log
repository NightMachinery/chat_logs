[05:57:01] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I don't think your package does what I was saying

[05:57:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Thereâ€™s a different system for run time and itâ€™s not nice
[05:58:05] <FromDiscord> <biz> if only nim had `requirw`

[20:44:17] <FromDiscord> <Phil> Exceptions can cause exceptions
[20:44:36] <PMunch> If you catch an exception in your library and want to pass it up the chain but wrap it up with some extra information you can use a parent exception
[20:44:42] <FromDiscord> <Phil> Often enough you have usecases where you catch an exception and re-throw it as a different one with a better error message, you can then attach the old one for a more complete stacktrace so you don't lose where the thing originated
