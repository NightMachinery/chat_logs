[02:59:55] <makomo> are there any elisp packages that provide a "collecting/accumulating" facility, like the many that exist for cl (https://www.cliki.net/COLLECTING)?
[03:00:11] <alphapapa[m]> cl-looop of course :P
[03:01:10] <makomo> of course :D, but sometimes that's a pain as soon as the condition gets more complicated. then i'm forced to use cl-loop's WHEN in order to still be able to use its COLLECT, etc. :(
[03:01:41] <alphapapa[m]> why is that a pain?  using WHEN with COLLECT is elegant and simple

[03:04:40] <makomo> because (1) the indentation can get a little bit ugly sometimes, (2) sometimes the collection condition is not computed by a simple expression and you might want to use more complex things such as COND, PCASE, etc. and collect (or not) in the individual branches
[03:04:46] <makomo> etc. :)
[03:04:52] <akater[m]> makomo: Consider porting existing cl code if you like it.
[03:04:56] <makomo> it just gives you more freedom
[03:05:25] <makomo> i do like cl-loop in general though, but sometimes it's inconvenient to work with. sadly it's not extensible :(
[03:05:36] <alphapapa[m]> ISTR an "iterate"-like macro being published in MELPA recently
[03:05:58] <makomo> akater[m]: sure, that's always an option. i was just wondering if there are some well-established ones already
[03:06:30] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: I recall commenting on the PR.  You should be able to find it on MELPA easily enough.
[03:06:33] <akater[m]> Collecting of course should be independent of iterating.
[03:07:11] <makomo> yeah, and that's why cl-loop's collect only gets you so far :)

[03:09:03] <bpalmer> makomo: the classic accumulating facility is to simply nconc your values and then nreverse it at the end. 
[03:09:07] <bpalmer> makomo: no special functions required.
[03:09:13] <mattf> the buffer accepted dying now out of the blue
[03:09:22] <bpalmer> or cons your values, Iguess.
[03:09:27] <alphapapa[m]> that's what cl-loop collect expands to, isn't it?
[03:09:33] <makomo> yes, probably

[09:52:47] <MysteriousSilver> setting browser in xdg-open?
[09:55:03] <jamzattack_> gnoo: browse-url-default-browser is a general purpose function to determine an external browser, not meant to be customised..  You can set `browse-url-browser-function' to a custom function that opens the browser that you want
[09:55:56] <gnoo> hmm, then eww should use browse-url-browser-function instead of browse-rul-deafault-browser
[09:56:01] <gnoo> for the & key
[09:56:40] <jamzattack_> hm, for me eww checks browse-url-secondary-browser-function
[09:56:41] <gnoo> i never got how to work with mime and xdg at all :(, i want my script to be a browser
[09:57:06] <jamzattack_> > This variable was added, or its default value changed, in Emacs 27.1.

[11:16:41] <ext0l> curious: i want to give org a shot for note-taking, and i see people talk about org-roam a lot, but i don't really do research (which is what i see a lot of people use it for). is it still useful compared to plain org-mode for that?

[11:17:13] <ext0l> my main reason for using it is because, well, i have a bad memory. i'm using an external task tracker for todos, but i'd like to retain information too.
[11:17:51] <codingquark> ext0l: I use org-brain for non-research notes. My finding is that it is _very_ useful to have a workflow of brain/roam type because it allows for a simple way to start taking notes, referring to them later etc

[20:25:25] <pjb> In this case, it's the emacs app on macOS coming from emacsformacosx.com

[20:26:48] <pjb> Indeed, emacs 26.1 on debian and X11 can display the svg graphically.
[20:27:03] <okflo> pjb: as you are on MacOS, you are not using brew, macports or fink? because installing it out of these would be easiest, and probably for sure include necessary dependencies?
[20:27:04] <pjb> I guess it's a bug report for emacsformacosx.com…

[20:29:33] <okflo> doesn't macports also provide an Quarz/Aqua-build of emacs (I don't know, as I switched to brew some years ago)? would be the easiest, just to try that

It runs through the part of `save-some-buffers' that is https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/files.el#L5792 , which evaluates the predicate to check if it returns a function -- which

[23:17:13] <Bayes> a line separator would be something like ; name of code section -------------------- (80 chars)
[23:17:54] <acdw> bayes: you can use  for page seperators

[23:19:15] <Bayes> in R you use # name of code section --- (80 chars) and then many IDEs will create an outline

[23:25:21] <Bayes> acdw do you save the "current state of the open buffers and windows" to reload it next time, or do you set up your windows and frames manually each time you work on something?
[23:25:30] <acdw> Bayes: manually
[23:26:05] <acdw> mattf: do you run emacs --daemon=main --debug-init, then open another terminal and run emacsclient -s main -c
