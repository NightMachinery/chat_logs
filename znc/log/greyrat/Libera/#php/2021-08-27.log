[02:21:46] <sumthing1980> hello
[02:21:53] <sumthing1980> when you have a fsockopen connection
[02:21:59] <sumthing1980> and fgets it
[02:22:08] <sumthing1980> do you get a special character at the end of connection
[02:22:09] <sumthing1980> EOF
[02:22:12] <sumthing1980> end of file?
[02:22:43] <sumthing1980> can you detect it at the end of file http transfer
[02:23:54] <Blondie101010> did you try feof()?
[02:24:14] <Sammitch> no usch thing as an "EOF special character" that comes from the underlying implementation, which in this case would be the socket closing.
[02:24:17] <Byteflux> sumthing1980: https://www.php.net/fgets
[02:24:20] <Byteflux> What do the docs say?
[02:24:32] <Byteflux> (Hint: the docs are pretty clear on this question)
[02:24:33] <Sammitch> that said, why are you accepting an HTTP request via bare socket?
[02:24:35] <sumthing1980> I know Im there
[02:24:51] <sumthing1980> thats what made me ask
[02:24:57] <Byteflux> I only point you there because the docs clearly state what happens on EOF
[02:24:58] <sumthing1980> is it a character at the end of transfer
[02:25:05] <Sammitch> no.
[02:25:17] <sumthing1980> like escape character
[02:25:32] <Sammitch> again, no.
[02:25:40] <Byteflux> Read the manual. This is a good, useful skill to have. What does the Return Values say?
[02:25:59] <Blondie101010> either way, feof() should work fine
[02:26:03] <Blondie101010> if not, report a bug
[02:26:16] <sumthing1980> Returns a string of up to length - 1 bytes read
[02:26:22] <Blondie101010> keep reading
[02:26:31] <Blondie101010> no need to paste it here
[02:26:33] <sumthing1980> so they dont provide it
[02:26:34] <Byteflux> Indeed feof() is the answer, but it should be combined with the result of fgets() to distinguish between an error and graceful EOF
[02:26:41] <sumthing1980> normally in c it is a character
[02:26:43] <sumthing1980> eof
[02:26:50] <Byteflux> sumthing1980: You ignored the whole second sentence in the line you pasted.
[02:26:57] <Blondie101010> no but anyways this is not a #c channel
[02:27:01] <Sammitch> feof() probably won't work in the context of what you're implementing, because most HTTP clients keep the connection open for subsquent requests, and a half-decnt HTTP server will read the header and know how many bytes to expect
[02:27:21] <Blondie101010> Sammitch:  prove it :P
[02:27:39] <sumthing1980> I know because transfers dont do always what is expected
[02:27:50] <Sammitch> I'm too busy repeatedly stating that there's no such thing as an "EOF character"
[02:28:08] <sumthing1980> I set the timeout to 9 seconds for example and some files somehow transfer everything then it timeouts
[02:28:15] <sumthing1980> other files close connection immediately
[02:28:25] <sumthing1980> anyway
[02:28:32] <Sammitch> depends on what is sending you the data, as previously stated
[02:28:34] <sumthing1980> so eof is saved as metadata to the connection
[02:28:36] <Byteflux> sumthing1980: Does this mean *nothing* to you? "If there is no more data to read in the file pointer, then false is returned."
[02:29:01] <sumthing1980> Byteflux: I wish it was that easy
[02:29:14] <Sammitch> Byteflux: that's not a binary state though, it'
[02:29:23] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: then share your actual code and show that actual issue on that
[02:29:30] <__adrian> it actually is (probably _more_ easy than how you're interpreting it)
[02:29:38] <Sammitch> Byteflux: that's not a binary state though, it's "there's more data right now", "there's no data currentlyu, but maybe in the future", and "there is nothing more".
[02:29:48] <Byteflux> It quite literally is that easy. If it isn't, then it's an application issue. If the connection is left open or the other end hasn't closed their write socket, then the socket is *readable*
[02:33:26] <Byteflux> That's the socket-specific answer. In relation to HTTP, you *normally* use Content-Length to determine the end of a response body. There are exceptions
[02:35:54] *** pizzaiolo is now known as pizza
[02:38:09] <sumthing1980> I do many many checks to see if a connection is over
[02:38:47] <Byteflux> You are wrongfully assuming that HTTP requires that a connection is terminated. It does not.
[02:38:48] <sumthing1980> for each I exit the while loop if it matches 1. stream meta data smd['eof']==1 check
[02:39:07] <Blondie101010> what?
[02:39:11] <sumthing1980> 2. dlpointer===false check 3. feof($dlpointer) check
[02:39:26] <Byteflux> HTTP as a protocol provides you with the mechanisms to determine when a message ends.
[02:39:27] <__adrian> to clarify, are you working with http? i didn't see where that assumption came from
[02:39:29] <Blondie101010> if feof() is true, that's it for sure
[02:39:45] <Blondie101010> so your logic has some flaws for sure
[02:39:45] <Byteflux> __adrian: much earlier, this is relating to a HTTP file transfer
[02:39:52] <__adrian> thx
[02:39:52] <sumthing1980> smd[timeout]==1 check smd[unread bytes] ==0 check
[02:40:05] <sumthing1980> even !dlpointer check for obscure reasons
[02:40:21] <sumthing1980> it still timeouts 9 seconds after it actually sent everything
[02:40:22] <Blondie101010> so you do checks you don't know why?
[02:40:27] <Blondie101010> did you try removing that?
[02:40:43] <sumthing1980> remove what
[02:41:16] <sumthing1980> each check has a break from the while loop but they dont catch it
[02:41:27] <sumthing1980> mostly they do
[02:41:35] <sumthing1980> but sometimes they dont
[02:42:09] <sumthing1980> I added a hack to see if </html> has been sent and then set the stream timeout to 0
[02:42:10] <Byteflux> If your *script* is timing out, it could be PHP's max execution time killing your script after 30 seconds or whatever.
[02:42:27] <sumthing1980> Byteflux: not the script the connection, like 9 seconds
[02:42:40] <sumthing1980> or whatever I set it to
[02:42:49] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: 00:59 < da_wunder> sumthing1980: then share your actual code and show that actual issue on that
[02:43:36] <sumthing1980> there are so many dependencies
[02:43:50] <__adrian> just the part you're asking about
[02:44:01] <__adrian> we don't want to see _everything_
[02:44:21] <Blondie101010> the root of troubleshooting is pinpointing and isolating where the issue is
[02:45:09] <Byteflux> A socket timeout could be related to an idle socket.
[02:45:16] <sumthing1980> I can put it if you wanna look at it though
[02:45:29] <sumthing1980> some functions missing that parse the urls and such
[02:46:11] <sumthing1980> https://controlc.com/0f87ca2a
[02:46:39] <Byteflux> Past the error as well.
[02:47:01] <sumthing1980> there is no error just timeout until max 9 seconds that I set in the code
[02:47:47] <Byteflux> Right so you've explicitly set a socket timeout for reading/writing.
[02:47:57] <sumthing1980> yes
[02:48:05] <sumthing1980> shouldnt I
[02:48:25] <Byteflux> That entirely depends.
[02:48:42] <sumthing1980> I can try without
[02:48:49] <da_wunder> hmm, just an idea but have you thinked to use some battle tested library for stuff like that?  eg. guzzle, symfony httpclient, etc.
[02:49:19] <Byteflux> You could probably even just use curl for this.
[02:49:40] <sumthing1980> Im working on so many things other than this that Ill have trouble learning that as well
[02:49:55] <sumthing1980> other things as in this project
[02:49:57] <Byteflux> Unlikely.
[02:50:05] <Byteflux> You're trying to learn something that's harder than the things we're suggesting.
[02:50:18] <Byteflux> That's why those tools exist in the first place, because what you're trying to do is *harder* not easier.
[02:50:53] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  didn't you notice that $dlpointer will NEVER become false inside the loop?
[02:51:06] <Blondie101010> it can't
[02:51:26] <Blondie101010> so stop writing stuff for the heck of trying, and start thinking
[02:51:36] <sumthing1980> if the connection closes it will be false no?
[02:51:39] <Blondie101010> no
[02:53:30] <da_wunder> usually using some existing library for things like that is just a lot of easier and faster way to get things done - those tools are heavily battle tested with thousands, millions, etc. projects with wide variation of developers
[02:53:37] <__adrian> mm
[02:53:44] <__adrian> use guzzle
[02:54:02] <Blondie101010> and please stop using globals
[02:54:09] <__adrian> this function is... nuts
[02:54:15] <Blondie101010> very
[02:54:50] <__adrian> i get the idea you're trying to port something from some old C
[02:54:54] <Byteflux> You're basically trying to reinvent a tool for something you don't understand, so you would be better off just using someone else's tool which is very well built and easy to use.
[02:54:57] <sumthing1980> you should see the rest then :)
[02:55:19] <Blondie101010> we've seen our share of bad code, but thanks anyways
[02:55:29] <sumthing1980> meh fsockopen is basic
[02:55:44] <__adrian> sumthing1980: very, very sincere: look at guzzle.
[02:55:59] <sumthing1980> I didnt have this timeout problem years ago this is new to me
[02:56:01] <__adrian> not telling you what to do, but look at it first
[02:56:08] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: or symfony httpclient
[02:56:19] <__adrian> sure
[02:56:19] <Byteflux> This code doesn't demonstrate the skillset of someone who is qualified to say fsockopen is basic.
[02:56:25] <sumthing1980> if it didnt have that problem I could shrink the whole thing down to a few lines
[02:56:40] <Blondie101010> it would be the case with guzzle
[02:56:48] <Blondie101010> and as I said, you wrote code that does nothing
[02:56:57] <Blondie101010> so yes it requires a major cleanup
[02:57:16] <sumthing1980> Byteflux: Im trying to find the problem with the timeout that is why it is bloated
[02:57:44] <__adrian> partway curious as to why you're doing the content-type sniffing
[02:58:25] <sumthing1980> Ill be trying to avoid non html or text files
[02:58:43] <sumthing1980> so maybe cancel the transfer later
[02:59:03] <__adrian> do you realize how fragile your approach is there?
[02:59:41] <Byteflux> Putting aside the several good options to choose from such as Guzzle, there's also at a bare minimum cURL which wouldn't be the best option, but way better than this.
[02:59:45] <sumthing1980> there are many checks you have to do to even detect if a file is binary or not
[03:00:11] *** Quits: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[03:00:12] <__adrian> if your goal is to be informational, why not just present the content-type header? if your goal is to make decisions, i wouldn't base it on this
[03:00:12] <Blondie101010> that sounds like you don't define what you want clearly enough
[03:00:32] <Byteflux> You can use Guzzle to easily read as many bytes from the response body as you want without consuming the whole thing at once.
[03:00:46] <Byteflux> There's no need for this.
[03:01:07] <Byteflux> Guzzle and any other capable HTTP client can read responses as a stream.
[03:01:13] <__adrian> yeah, answer is to use an existing, well-tested library
[03:01:25] <sumthing1980> thanks for the suggestions
[03:01:26] <da_wunder> ^
[03:01:30] <__adrian> np
[03:01:40] <Blondie101010> if you only want HTML documents, then just looking for "<html" in the first 100 bytes should be enough
[03:01:54] <__adrian> welllll...
[03:01:55] <__adrian> :p
[03:01:57] <sumthing1980> and I removed the stream set timeout 9 seconds things
[03:02:00] <da_wunder> I would just recommend you to try those out - should not take more than couple of minutes really
[03:02:10] <__adrian> <html> is not a required tag  ;)
[03:02:18] <sumthing1980> thing, now it waits and timeouts 60 seconds after it has stopped transfer
[03:02:35] <sumthing1980> that was the problem Ive been trying to fix
[03:02:39] <__adrian> that ^ is what blondie means by "does nothing"
[03:02:40] <sumthing1980> it stalls 60 seconds
[03:02:43] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  is the server on HTTP 1.0 or 1.1?
[03:03:27] <sumthing1980> wait
[03:03:56] <sumthing1980> http 1.1
[03:04:12] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: really just try out those battle tested libraries - it should not take so long time to just try those out
[03:04:24] <sumthing1980> chunked, connection keep alive
[03:04:45] <Blondie101010> what I expected
[03:05:20] <sumthing1980> I can set the timeout to like 3 seconds but what if I encounter a really slow server that needs more time to send
[03:05:32] <Blondie101010> gosh why does your block continue after break?
[03:05:44] <Blondie101010> I think you broke your blocks without realizing it
[03:06:03] <Blondie101010> look for the line with feof()

[03:08:23] <sumthing1980> Ive been rearranging things
[03:09:44] <Blondie101010> why are you checking the content-length without using it?

[03:10:11] <sumthing1980> ok
[03:10:12] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: is there some reason why you don't want to even try out those battle tested libraries - that multiple people here adviced you to try?

[03:11:34] <Blondie101010> what breaks the loop?
[03:11:45] <Blondie101010> because that's what you came for, so I want to know
[03:11:46] <sumthing1980> strlen($buffer)==0
[03:11:58] <Blondie101010> that's no good
[03:11:59] <sumthing1980> and

[03:12:19] <Blondie101010> data is not necessarily a continuous stream
[03:12:36] <sumthing1980> but it is blocking
[03:12:39] <Blondie101010> you need to rely on good factors, not bad ones like that
[03:12:48] <Blondie101010> check the length first

[03:15:41] <sumthing1980> so smd timeout and buffer==0 is what breaks the loop

[03:16:03] <sumthing1980> ok lets talk about something else

[03:17:07] <sumthing1980> Blondie101010: you were saying if no content length

[03:17:36] <Blondie101010> othewise they'll have tons of complaints
[03:18:16] <Sammitch> IIRC if there's no Content-Length header the end of the request is denoted by the closure of the connection.

[03:18:38] <Blondie101010> which is not the case he encountered with the 60 second wait

[03:23:27] * Blondie101010 nods
[03:23:33] <sumthing1980> yea that would require a next version with non blocking connection
[03:23:36] <sumthing1980> maybe later
[03:23:43] <Blondie101010> no don't
[03:23:48] <Blondie101010> guzzle
[03:23:51] <Sammitch> say... hasn't guzzle implemented this already?>
[03:24:18] <sumthing1980> man I have also implemented it many times in the years

[03:24:29] <sumthing1980> thanks fooor the heelp
[03:24:37] <Sammitch> or, more pertinently, poor overworked and underappreciated internet hero daniel@haxx.se
[03:25:40] <Blondie101010> curl is fine, but not very user friendly
[03:26:16] <Sammitch> true, but guzzle just wraps curl, and curl is what handles low-level cases like this
[03:27:55] <Sammitch> and can we here not sympathize with someone being screeched at constantly to rewrite their projects in "$buzzword of the day"? eg: rust
[03:28:26] <sumthing1980> does content length include headers?
[03:28:30] <sumthing1980> nvm
[03:29:00] <Byteflux> I dunno, Rust isn't really laughable anymore. At least it's a serious contender to C++ anyhow.
[03:37:34] <Sammitch> it's not that Rust isn't a good language, it's that: 1. in another couple years there's going to be something that everyone thinks needs to replace Rust. 2. rewriting curl in rust would make it not curl anymore.
[03:38:16] <Sammitch> if someone wants to write a curl replacement in rust, they can fill their boots.

[04:48:08] <sumthing1980> so when you get a content encoding gzip
[04:48:12] <sumthing1980> you do this to access it
[04:48:25] <sumthing1980> gzinflate( substr($content,10,-8) );
[04:48:39] <sumthing1980> any idea why that substr 10 -8 works?
[04:50:55] <Blondie101010> because someone took the time to implement it and document it
[04:51:07] <Blondie101010> ever seen a man page on php.net?
[04:52:35] <__adrian> i'd guess the question that's really being asked is, "what are the first ten and last eight bytes of $content?"
[04:52:55] <Blondie101010> wasn't obvious, but possible
[04:53:21] <sumthing1980> *I* added it to the manual pages for php.net it doesnt mention it as far as I have seen
[04:53:31] <sumthing1980> still dont know why though
[04:53:41] <Blondie101010> what are you referring to?
[04:53:50] <sumthing1980> gzinflate( substr($content,10,-8) );
[04:54:21] <sumthing1980> maybe I missed it but I added a note to fgets for it, it hasnt been published yet
[04:54:33] <sumthing1980> I found it on another site
[04:54:38] <Blondie101010> which function's page are you talking about?
[04:54:56] <__adrian> first, do you understand what it does?
[04:55:13] <Blondie101010> no but he added it to the manual!
[04:55:25] <sumthing1980> it extracts the filecontents of a gzipped content
[04:55:32] <__adrian> ...
[04:55:47] <__adrian> so you don't know what _any_ of it is doing. ok
[04:56:10] <__adrian> i'd assumed you were talking about the 2,3 args of substr
[04:56:15] <sumthing1980> I am
[04:56:28] <Blondie101010> then that's not related to the gzipped content
[04:56:28] <__adrian> then why didn't you answer that?
[04:56:38] <__adrian> do you know what the args  10, -8  do?
[04:56:49] <sumthing1980> start from 10 minus the 8 last
[04:57:08] <sumthing1980> why would the http content be mixing things that isnt gzip is my question
[04:57:16] <__adrian> yeah. so next question is, what are those bytes?
[04:57:38] <sumthing1980> I dont know so Im asking you
[04:57:38] <__adrian> i don't understand that question
[04:57:51] <Blondie101010> I think we should completely stop answering this guzzle replacement crap questions
[04:57:54] <__adrian> "why would the http content be mixing things that isnt gzip?"  this, i mean
[04:58:20] <Blondie101010> if you want to implement a protocol, read the RFCs and do it well
[04:58:27] <Blondie101010> otherwise use existing tools and libs
[04:58:37] <sumthing1980> this doesnt have to do with downloading
[04:58:47] <da_wunder> let me guess, those earlier http request are sending gzipped response...
[04:58:55] <Blondie101010> isn't the question about the HTTP protocol?
[04:59:03] <da_wunder> so once again - please use some library for those
[04:59:19] <sumthing1980> I have already downloaded it
[04:59:27] <Blondie101010> now start learning how to use it
[04:59:28] <sumthing1980> I do manage ungzipping them with that
[04:59:39] <Blondie101010> good, keep going
[04:59:51] <sumthing1980> I was wondering why those parts should be left out
[05:00:03] <sumthing1980> Im working on deflate encoding now

[05:37:14] <physikoi> oh, you said "check" and that's what's ... sec
[05:38:44] <Byteflux> Seemingly CHECK constraints are not supported without executing a raw statement.
[05:42:15] <__adrian> sqlite also supports CHECK
[05:42:33] <__adrian> but yeah, you'd need to open a bug with phinx if they don't support it
[05:42:36] <Byteflux> Right, the SQL linked is using CHECK for those constraints.
[05:43:39] <physikoi> Byteflux: yeah, phinx does support raw. looks like i might have to use it to get those checks in place. i'll also submit an issue with the cake folks as __adrian suggested

[05:43:53] <Byteflux> I don't think any of the major PHP frameworks natively support this in their migrations, you just have to execute a query within the migration that alters the table to add those constraints.
[05:44:27] <Blondie101010> definitely
[05:45:14] <__adrian> still doubletake when people talk about phinx being a cake tool

[06:08:39] <da_wunder> and may I ask what are you actually trying to solve with that - "I may need to find headers of the files" - ?
[06:09:07] <Blondie101010> he's trying to do a bad HTTP client from scratch, period
[06:09:28] <da_wunder> explain clearly what you're trying to solve and why
[06:10:18] <sumthing1980> I have already downloaded the files
[06:10:24] <sumthing1980> now Imma decode it
[06:10:34] <Blondie101010> so go ahead
[06:10:39] <sumthing1980> gzip encoding works
[06:10:49] <sumthing1980> but this says deflate it is different
[06:11:00] <Blondie101010> yes they are different
[06:11:08] <da_wunder> and that doesn't answer those questions at all - so please answer that question that I asked
[06:11:46] <Blondie101010> read the first paragraph of https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gzcompress.php to get an idea
[06:13:13] <sumthing1980> what im trying to solve? Im trying to decode a compressed http transfer that was encoded with deflate
[06:13:44] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  and I just gave you the bad solution you want
[06:13:56] <Blondie101010> the proper one is not to handle HTTP yourself
[06:14:11] <da_wunder> and libraries like guzzle and symfony/httpclient are already doing that for you - for those http requests...
[06:14:21] <Blondie101010> there are two gzip format functions in PHP and they are mentioned in the note on that page
[06:14:24] <Blondie101010> so go read
[06:15:19] <da_wunder> so if you're using those - then are you talking about how to eg. unzip file that you downloaded with those libraries or something else
[06:15:56] <Blondie101010> he's looking for !+gzinflate
[06:15:56] <php-bot> he's looking for, binary gzinflate(binary data[, int max_decoded_len])  - Decode raw deflate encoded data - http://php.net/gzinflate
[06:23:02] <deltab> may need http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1950.html instead
[06:23:41] <deltab> 'Transfer-Encoding: deflate' is defined as a zlib stream using deflate compression
[06:24:49] <deltab> so there's a header; and if you use gzip, it's the same compressed data, but a different header
[06:25:50] <deltab> using substr can remove the header, whichever one it is, but only if you get the right length, and there are optional parts
[06:26:33] <deltab> which cause the length to vary
[06:27:26] <da_wunder> or just try to use those libraries that have been mentioned multiple times (4-6 if I remember right)...
[06:27:39] <deltab> right
[06:27:52] <da_wunder> assuming that the problem is still with that http request
[06:28:18] <sumthing1980> no the download was never a problem
[06:28:26] <sumthing1980> they are already stored
[06:28:29] <deltab> added to which, some servers say they'll send one but actually send another. I suggest trying each decompression function until you find the right one, and don't bother with trying to remove the header
[06:28:52] <Byteflux> Guzzle is capable of decoding responses automatically.
[06:28:58] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[06:29:25] <deltab> if you have it, run 'file' on your downloaded file
[06:29:28] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: so once again - explain your actual issue, what you're trying to do and why and what is the actual problem - share code to show us the issue
[06:30:03] *** Joins: Poboy (~Poboy@user/poboy)
[06:30:13] <sumthing1980> I can share the actual data that has been transferred
[06:30:24] <deltab> great
[06:30:43] <da_wunder> or just share that url where you downloaded that
[06:31:25] <Blondie101010> he didn't download that, he just used an incomplete http client
[06:31:32] <da_wunder> and tell us what you want to do with that downloaded data and why
[06:32:23] <Byteflux> Right, if they used a proper HTTP client, they wouldn't be wasting all this time learning how to deflate/decompress it because the client would've done that for them.
[06:32:29] <da_wunder> I should asked that hours ago - because I like to do example repositories for people who has some questions - I bet that your issue would been solved hours ago already
[06:33:54] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: if you share that information I might do that example for you later today - it's 05:03 here atm, so I think that I need some sleep
[06:35:04] <sumthing1980> hey it turns out I think that the actual download is broken, Ihave many others of the same type and deflate and same series in filename
[06:35:18] <sumthing1980> they all inflate correctly except this one
[06:35:31] <sumthing1980> so gzinflate works
[06:35:43] <Blondie101010> maybe you're not parsing the headers well enough
[06:35:44] <sumthing1980> something is broken with that one
[06:35:56] <Blondie101010> stop assuming you're not the main issue
[06:36:28] <sumthing1980> you cant fix something if the input is broken
[06:36:30] <sumthing1980> what do you mean
[06:36:54] <sumthing1980> Ive wasted time for nothing
[06:37:30] <Blondie101010> as I said, I suspect that you just didn't interpret the headers properly..  that also involves that you didn't read any HTTP RFCs and yet you try to do it in awful code
[06:37:48] <Blondie101010> use what does a great job already, or read RFCs!!!
[06:39:00] <sumthing1980> Im saying it encountered a faulty input no amount of reading can fix that
[06:39:15] <Blondie101010> are you sure the input is in the format you thought it was?
[06:39:21] <Blondie101010> you just know you read "that"
[06:39:56] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: so are you still using your own implementation to fetch that data OR are you using library like guzzle, symfony/httpclient, etc. for that - simple question
[06:40:16] <Blondie101010> while it's imaginable that a web server might have a buggy encoding, it seems rather unlikely
[06:40:24] <Blondie101010> (because they read RFCs)
[06:41:22] <Blondie101010> and you can be sure the guy who wrote curl knows them all by heart
[06:42:04] <sumthing1980> domain/sitemap_certaincategory_filename1.xml through domain/sitemap_certaincategory_filename10.xml works except one that I spent my time trying to fix
[06:42:27] <da_wunder> that did not answer my simple question
[06:42:55] <sumthing1980> Im using my own downloading code
[06:43:23] <Blondie101010> so it doesn't even deserve the name it's supposed to be?  a http client
[06:43:34] <da_wunder> ok, and did you even try those libraries that was recommend you, like hours ago?
[06:43:40] <Byteflux> I did myself a favor and just put them on /ignore. It makes this whole one-sided conversation much more entertaining. It also helps me to not waste time on people who don't deserve my time.
[06:43:53] <sumthing1980> you guys really have attitude problems
[06:44:00] <deltab> sometimes the file is stored compressed on the server, and the server attaches the TE header based on the filename extension (Apache has config to do that).
[06:44:01] <Blondie101010> Byteflux:  yeah it's tempting
[06:45:01] <Blondie101010> yeah, precompression can be an interesting option, depending on the use case
[06:46:22] <deltab> so a server can send the wrong header (because the filename is wrong) even though the programmer knows what they're doing
[06:46:30] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: ok, so you don't want to listen to us at all -  you're on my ignore list at this point so we don't meet again - so have a nice evening
[06:47:21] <deltab> I think there can be value in people trying to do things themselves, even if it's just to learn why libraries are valuable
[06:47:48] <da_wunder> did you look that code?
[06:48:00] <deltab> no, didn't see any
[06:48:13] <Blondie101010> it was disgusting
[06:48:19] <Byteflux> deltab: Definitely, but this isn't one of those cases. This is just some person outsourcing their work to IRC and isn't motivated by a desire to learn.
[06:48:24] <Blondie101010> plenty of useless code that really did nothing
[06:48:54] <Blondie101010> Byteflux ++
[06:49:03] <da_wunder> deltab: see this - 01:16 < sumthing1980> https://controlc.com/0f87ca2a
[06:49:48] <Byteflux> When confronted with the suggesting of using a pre-existing library, they simply claimed that doing so would be too difficult / too much effort to learn, compared to doing what they're doing with the code just now linked.
[06:50:39] <da_wunder> and eg. recommendations using curl for that
[06:51:10] <da_wunder> and after that even shared link like https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/03/20/curl-is-23-years-old-today/
[06:51:52] <Byteflux> A pre-requisite to actually doing something like this from scratch is a willingness to read the RFC. Ofc that willingness is non-existent.
[06:52:07] <da_wunder> so imho if someone is actually reading those messages and opening those links and _read_ what there is - it should not be so hard to at least to try those out - imho
[06:53:13] <sumthing1980> Thanks for the help, again it turns out the file itself is broken
[06:53:45] <sumthing1980> kind of pointless to call someones code disgusting it isnt even the part that decodes the files
[06:55:00] <Blondie101010> I gave you that solution
[06:55:19] <Blondie101010> my intent is not to cause you harm, but hopefully to wake you up!
[06:55:48] <Blondie101010> you do write crappy code, no doubt about that
[06:56:04] <sumthing1980> ?
[06:56:38] <Blondie101010> just show it anywhere and you'll see absolutely everyone will complain about it
[06:56:45] <Blondie101010> it's just bad
[06:57:27] <sumthing1980> I got it the first time
[06:57:30] <sumthing1980> whats the point
[06:58:00] <Blondie101010> if you want to learn how do things (properly), you should take the time to actually read the manual pages attentively
[06:58:22] <Blondie101010> understand what your code is actually doing
[06:58:36] <Blondie101010> then eventually you'll learn to organize it better
[07:00:00] <sumthing1980> and water is wet
[07:00:32] <deltab> reading other code helps with that; reading documentation, not so much
[07:00:49] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  globals are bad
[07:01:18] <Blondie101010> normally a average to good programmer discovers that on their own after a year or two full time on a new project
[07:01:33] <Blondie101010> most today get told it is right away as we did to you
[07:01:47] <Blondie101010> and so is @
[07:02:05] <Blondie101010> if you have to use @, it means you don't understand how to set up your system
[07:02:10] <Byteflux> Globals = bad? Yeah we've been telling people that in this channel for almost 20 years.
[07:03:28] <Blondie101010> after that there is abstraction...  linear thinking always ends with never ending code
[07:04:21] <Blondie101010> learning abstraction is not easy, at least not to most people
[07:07:50] <deltab> sumthing1980: why is $origin_url_analysis declared global? it looks like it'd work just as well as a local
[07:08:34] <sumthing1980> it is created by another function and used by many other functions it needs to be called once and accessible many times
[07:09:19] <Blondie101010> that is where abstraction comes in the most
[07:09:34] <Blondie101010> if you organize your stuff by dependencies, then the problem goes away
[07:09:35] <deltab> other functions can call tr1_url_analysis2() when they need to
[07:10:30] <Blondie101010> only a few small functions should need to know that variable
[07:11:42] <deltab> reducing the number of places a variable is used makes it easier to track how and when data is passed through it
[07:12:00] <sumthing1980> but many functions do need to know that variable
[07:12:16] <sumthing1980> instead of asking a function what it says, it reads it itself
[07:12:19] <deltab> they don't: they can use their own variables
[07:12:26] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  what you showed us is a syntaxically correct function, but a really bad one in terms of design
[07:12:41] <Blondie101010> read on SOLID principles
[07:12:53] <Blondie101010> it will tell you the worst 5 things YOU do
[07:15:47] <deltab> sumthing1980: so if you have another function that needs the parts of the url, that function can call tr1_url_analysis2() and store the result in a local variable. That means it doesn't have to depend on whether dl_urlv3() has been called yet or not
[07:17:06] <Blondie101010> careful as that could seem to suggest static variables, but with OO it's solved through properties
[07:17:57] <Blondie101010> note that I don't dislike static *variables* (not properties or whatever else)
[07:18:34] <Blondie101010> but they are often frowned upon
[07:20:35] <deltab> static variables are similar to global variables in being dependent on what happened prior to the current call; likewise properties
[07:20:56] <Blondie101010> no there are key differences
[07:21:04] <Blondie101010> a static variable has limited scope
[07:21:09] <deltab> yes
[07:21:13] <deltab> similar, not the same
[07:21:42] <Blondie101010> keeping state in a function is useful when you don't have properties to handle it
[07:22:59] <deltab> that can also be true; but I think url parsing is unlikely to need that
[07:23:11] <Blondie101010> ugh
[07:23:13] <Blondie101010> yeah no
[07:24:22] <deltab> I'm assuming that tr1_url_analysis2 just parses the url, but maybe that's not all
[07:25:39] <deltab> anyway I should get to bed

[12:27:13] <DrowningElysium> It's echo'd as is on the website. So it created funky characters on our website
[12:27:41] <TinoDidriksen> It's never good to let them be escaped. Waste of bytes for no reason.
[12:27:50] <TinoDidriksen> It's bizarre that the default is to escape.
[12:28:26] <DrowningElysium> Yeah, I would have expected it also to just output whatever is in the array
[12:28:35] <biberu> less risky when it goes through other systems, with other devs that might have gotten their encodings wrong

[12:29:04] <DrowningElysium> Well Yii:t() doesn't know how to handle the escaped strings
[12:29:14] <TinoDidriksen> What? It should.
[12:29:31] <TinoDidriksen> Handling escapes is required by the JSON standard.
[12:29:51] <DrowningElysium> Well Yii doesn't support JSON by default :P
[12:30:01] <biberu> huh?
[12:30:05] <TinoDidriksen> Then json_decode() it first...

[12:34:43] <TinoDidriksen> JSON has critical mass. Even though anything going over HTTP will be compressed, it still helps with both size and CPU to just not escape.

[16:51:45] <Naktibalda>  MrBurns: your php runs on cheap hosting that doesn't permit external connections :p
