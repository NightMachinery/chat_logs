[05:52:53] <robopat> hello
[05:53:21] <robopat> I've been googling around for hours and can't find a real solution here. Does there happen to be anyone here who could share some example rc/config files for fetchmail that will allow me to connect to a commercial gmail or outlook account.
[06:57:54] <lunaphyte> rather, you can share a pastebin of your config and the issue, and others may help
[07:15:50] <lunaphyte> also worth noting is that getmail is generally accepted as the successor to fetchmail, and you might find that offlineimap is a notable alternative too
[07:17:00] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:20:09] <pj> I should note that fetchmail has been capable for quite some time now of delivering directly to your MDA, Not saying it's better or worse than getmail, just that reason for using getmail now also applies to fetchmail.

[18:51:25] <ldiamond> Gsuite legacy free is going to force people out of their free account, looking into self-hosting my mail server. Looking for good reasons why I shouldn't do that. In terms of high availability, if the server is down for whatever reason, will there be multiple attemps to deliver the email over a certain period of time?
[18:52:00] <lunaphyte> it all depends on your needs
[18:52:09] <lunaphyte> how "critical" is email?
[18:53:08] <lunaphyte> generally, if an mx is inaccessible for less than 5 days, mail will still arrive
[18:53:13] <colo> ldiamond, remote MTAs/mailservers do not just "give up" on delivery after a (few) failed attempt(s). your MX does not have to have 100% uptime.
[18:53:38] <lunaphyte> but - note that ymmv, because that is not an empirical promise, and so it leads things back to how "critical" is this?
[18:56:17] <ldiamond> 5 days? That's perfectly fine then.
[18:57:20] <ldiamond> I was mostly worried about down time due to power outages and things like that.
[18:57:45] <ldiamond> I'd say email is pretty critical, that's where we'd get potentially very important information.
[18:58:36] <ldiamond> But I'd say I can definitely get 99% uptime.
[18:58:36] <lunaphyte> if your mx is unreachable, for any amount of time, there is some risk that mail may be lost.  particularly transactional email.  it's unavoidable.
[19:00:16] <ldiamond> In terms of delivery, if I use my own server to deliver emails, are my emails more likely to be marked as spam?
[19:00:30] <lunaphyte> i'm not sure what you're asking
[19:00:35] <lunaphyte> deliver emails where?
[19:01:16] <ldiamond> When I send emails.
[19:01:21] <lunaphyte> oh
[19:01:44] <lunaphyte> yes, at first
[19:02:07] <lunaphyte> deliverability requires constant attention
[19:03:43] <lunaphyte> the better your reputation, the better your deliverability will be
[19:04:02] <lunaphyte> this mostly means [but is not limited to] the reputation of your ip address
[19:04:58] <lunaphyte> if you don't have a reputation, it will take some time before one develops.  and worse, if you have bad one, then it will be that much more work
[19:05:07] <lunaphyte> like anything in life, naturally
[19:09:04] <ldiamond> This is the main problem then. First, I have a dynamic ip. I could use my cloud server as a proxy and make sure to reserve that IP long-term. But I'd need the deliverability to be excellent from the start since the migration would be painful otherwise.
[19:09:41] <ldiamond> I'm wondering if I could still send via gmail though
[19:09:53] <lunaphyte> emitting email from a dynamic ip is likely to be highly, highly problematic
[19:10:24] <lunaphyte> there is no way to ensure that deliverability will be excellent, day one.  it's not possible
[19:10:33] <ldiamond> I'm guessing I can get a static ipv6 but that email via ipv6 won't be better.
[19:11:12] <lunaphyte> if you only have an ip6 address, there will be many destinations that cannot be reached [or sources that cannot reach you]
[19:12:00] <ldiamond> What kind of alternatives should I be looking at, other than self-hosting it?
[19:23:24] <lunaphyte> i don't follow
[19:24:09] <lunaphyte> "self-hosting" is just silly, largely meaningless term, borne out of the current trend of outsourcing
[19:25:00] <lunaphyte> anyway, the bottom line is you either run your own services, or you have someone else do it.  call it whatever you like [cloud, self hosting, third party, whatever], it's still the same thing, in the end
[19:25:26] <Khepra> "generally, if an mx is inaccessible for less than 5 days, mail will still arrive"    [citation required]
[19:25:38] <Khepra> that's just postfix default. doesn't make any guarantees of cloud mailer senders
[19:25:43] <lunaphyte> if you want to run your own services, then how you do that depends on the conditions
[19:27:40] <lunaphyte> if you want to run services at home, for example, then my advice is to use a vps for relay
[19:28:41] <lunaphyte> Khepra: i'm not sure what you mean "just postfix default"
[19:30:39] <Khepra> I know a lot of servers that will expire the queue much, much sooner than the (postfix) default 5 days
[19:40:03] <lunaphyte> yes, that's correct

[21:36:30] <ldiamond> I don't see why you find it silly but whatever.
[21:37:16] <lunaphyte> you can think of it like this, if you like - is the opposite of "outsourcing", "insourcing"?  ;)
