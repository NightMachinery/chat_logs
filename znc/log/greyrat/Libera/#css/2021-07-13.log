[00:00:42] <Rockwood> okay entuland thanks
[00:03:41] <entuland> yw
[00:04:04] <entuland> MaxFury, do you know what the comma means there?
[00:04:19] <entuland> only the first selector of that comma-separated list has the .lol class specified
[00:04:50] <entuland> also, none of that applies to tables, strictly speaking
[00:04:58] <Rockwood> hide should be popup div am right?
[00:05:08] <entuland> they all apply to TDs and THs
[00:05:24] <entuland> Rockwood, can't tell, it depends on what you want to achieve exactly
[00:05:41] <entuland> I guess you can try and see if it works
[00:05:50] <entuland> if it doesn't, you can share your current code so that we can see what you see
[00:06:18] <Rockwood> i just free from interview
[00:06:34] <Rockwood> i am going to edit the code
[00:06:38] <entuland> okay
[00:09:24] <Rockwood> new code is looks like --> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq
[00:11:24] <entuland> you're still using className
[00:11:45] <entuland> you're not hiding anything
[00:12:23] <Rockwood> oh
[00:14:32] <Rockwood> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq now chnaged
[00:14:35] <Rockwood> changed
[00:15:27] <Rockwood> popup not showing on hover
[00:16:53] <entuland> not sure if you're going by trial and error or whether you have understood how the technique works and just failed to apply it properly
[00:17:05] <entuland> where is the code that should make the popup appear?
[00:17:44] <Rockwood> on the hover on                         <li className="heading">First Stat</li>
[00:17:56] <entuland> first, you know that className is wrong
[00:18:04] <Rockwood> i changed
[00:18:11] <Rockwood> let me chk again there
[00:18:25] <Rockwood> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq
[00:18:34] <Rockwood> its changed already in updated code
[00:18:54] *** Quits: MaxFury (~MaxFury@110.235.228.115) (Quit: Client closed)
[00:19:20] <Rockwood> now i have class instead of className
[00:19:42] <entuland> your ".heading:hover" rule is saying "when .heading is hovered, make _.heading_ display: block"
[00:20:55] <entuland> see if this helps: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/khpeqcot/
[00:21:32] <entuland> the nested "level-two" class isn't strictly necessary
[00:23:06] <entuland> same result, slightly different style in the selector choice: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/khpeqcot/1/

[04:25:54] <michigan> One more thing - should dark mode color schemes be default on YouTube, Facebook etc.?
[04:38:23] <pavonia> Why would they?
[04:42:48] <michigan> pavonia: white bright light is damaging to the eyes and skin, especially at night when most of us are awake
[04:43:37] <michigan> pavonia: there's a reason cinemas are not full of fancy colorfull lights - colors or strong light change your visual perception, and degrade the overall experience
[04:45:10] <entuland> the point is why they should _default_ to dark mode
[04:45:28] <entuland> if you want them to use dark mode, set them to dark
[04:45:36] <michigan> entuland: i don't know, that's what i'm asking you
[04:45:47] <michigan> yeah but most people that i know all switch to dark modes immediately when available
[04:46:01] <entuland> that's about options
[04:46:02] <michigan> so why make the user having to go through all that trouble
[04:46:10] <michigan> entuland: yeah and too many options are also damaging
[04:46:12] <entuland> how is that a trouble?
[04:46:26] <michigan> because you have to go to settings and do a lot of stuff
[04:46:39] <michigan> when you could be doing other things instead, like consuming the actual content of the website/app
[04:46:46] <entuland> what if I prefer the normal mode and they defaulted to dark, why should _I_ go through all that trouble?
[04:47:03] <entuland> in reality, it boils down to whatever the site owners decide
[04:47:20] <michigan> this is basic user experience, not forcing the user to do a lot of unnecessary stuff
[04:47:44] <entuland> the fact that you and most if not all the people you know prefer dark mode doesn't mean the rest of the world does
[04:49:10] <michigan> also, dark mode increases battery life
[04:49:12] <pavonia> michigan: "damaging to the eyes and skin" - Do you have any reliable source for that? Also I would believe most people are active at day, not night
[04:49:29] <michigan> entuland: also your "all about options" statement
[04:49:40] <entuland> options are good
[04:49:44] <michigan> no they're not
[04:49:47] <michigan> ever heard of buridan's ass?
[04:49:57] <entuland> imagine if they defaulted to dark mode and they didn't let you switch to light mode
[04:50:17] <michigan> "It refers to a hypothetical situation wherein an ass that is equally hungry and thirsty is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the paradox assumes the ass will always go to whichever is closer, it dies of both hunger and thirst since it cannot make any rational decision between the hay and water."
[04:50:23] <entuland> something which, by the way, some websites do
[04:50:28] <michigan> too many options make it difficult for people to make decisions
[04:50:35] <entuland> meh
[04:50:37] <michigan> something netflix and others are starting to realize
[04:50:41] <entuland> meh
[04:51:21] <entuland> start a petition and convince youtube and facebook to default to dark mode so that you don't have to go through the trouble of doing a couple of clicks
[04:51:29] <michigan> research shows that in the course of 30 years, you spend 70 days trying to choose among the choices streaming services provide
[04:52:08] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net)
[04:52:56] <pavonia> Given your assumptions are correct, people would immediately choose dark mode. so there would be nothing to ponder about
[04:53:31] <michigan> im not just assuming, a lot of it is facts and a lot of it is based on actual research
[04:53:44] *** Quits: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net) (Client Quit)
[04:53:48] <entuland> you're arguing about two different points
[04:53:51] <michigan> you guys arent much into design, cinematography, architecture and most importantly web usability?
[04:53:53] <entuland> one, they should default to dark
[04:53:58] <entuland> two, they should give less options
[04:54:01] <michigan> entuland: youre arguing just for the sake of arguing
[04:54:22] <pavonia> michigan: Could you link to some of this research?
[04:54:39] <michigan> ive been following nngroup.com for 20-30 years
[04:54:43] <michigan> i bet most of you aren't even that old
[04:54:47] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net)
[04:55:24] <entuland> honestly, I'm not even interested in seeing any of such research, it's a no-brainer that every website does whatever they like better and it's bullshit to say that options, as a blanket statement, are bad
[04:55:34] <michigan> entuland: this research is vital
[04:55:35] <pavonia> "The short answer to this common question is no. The amount of blue light from electronic devices, including smartphones, tablets, LCD TVs, and laptop computers, is not harmful to the retina or any other part of the eye." https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/will-blue-light-from-electronic-devices-increase-my-risk-of-macular-degeneration-and-blindness-2019040816365

[04:56:02] <michigan> especially if you're making your own streaming service or social network. such small details which you obviously dont care about, can have huge consequences if you have millions of users
[04:56:29] <michigan> impacting your earnings, search engine rankings and all that stuff
[04:57:11] <michigan> pavonia: im talking about glaring white light, especially when the rest of the room is dark
[04:57:20] <entuland> what I don't get is why you're wasting _your_ time trying to, possibly, convince people that has no power whatsoever in changing the things you want to change, instead of barking to the right tree (assuming they'll even bother listening to you) or instead of simply doing those two clicks and thank the website owners for letting you get dark mode instead of having to override the CSS on your user stylesheet
[04:57:36] <michigan> with other light sources around, naturally it wont matter this much
[04:57:45] <michigan> entuland: well, i was asking you guys for ideas
[04:58:29] <entuland> I have given you my idea - options are good, defaulting to light or dark mode should probably be matter of querying each website's userbase so that the owners do what their users want
[04:58:31] <michigan> didnt get any, so. im out, peace
[04:58:49] <michigan> entuland: options are horrible: https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2019/choose-it-or-lose-it-media-choice-abounds-but-many-americans-stay-with-what-they-know/
[04:58:56] <entuland> I'm positive that google runs such kind of stats
[04:59:17] <michigan> 21%, one in every five americans, just end up watching nothing because they cant make a choice
[04:59:34] <entuland> I'm italian
[04:59:47] <michigan> its both bad psychology and bad UX making people having to go such pain in order to use your service
[04:59:59] <entuland> and I rarely if ever watch TV / streaming services
[05:00:01] <michigan> entuland: well, congratulations on winning the EM. you guys deserved it
[05:00:11] <michigan> entuland: shouldnt you be out celebrating right now? :D
[05:00:17] <entuland> what's EM?
[05:01:25] <michigan> oh, you're gonna be like that. fine
[05:01:40] <entuland> meh
[05:01:42] <michigan> probably arent even italian
[05:01:45] <entuland> ahahah
[05:01:46] <entuland> yeah
[05:02:22] <pavonia> michigan: Are you seriously arguing, that if people are overwhelmed by choosing between hundreds of options, they would be too by choosing between two options?
[05:03:10] <entuland> pavonia, I'm quite positive they are - look, michigan can't decide about keeping it up or dropping it, for instance
[05:03:13] <michigan> pavonia: the ass thing?
[05:03:20] <michigan> pavonia: thats just a paradox
[05:03:31] <michigan> and ofcourse youre gonna have more than two options on your website
[05:03:37] <pavonia> I was refering to that last article
[05:04:21] <michigan> well
[05:04:29] <michigan> thanks guys, you convinced me to use dark mode by default
[05:04:41] <entuland> see, that's a very bad idea
[05:04:45] <michigan> hmm.. look at that https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/
[05:04:52] <entuland> if you _do_ have a website and a userbase, ask your userbase
[05:04:56] <pavonia> "The satisfaction of choices by number of options available can be described by an inverted "U" model.[6] In this model, having no choice results in very low satisfaction. Initially more choices lead to more satisfaction, but as the number of choices increases it then peaks and people tend to feel more pressure, confusion, and potentially dissatisfaction with their choice." https://en.wikipedia.or
[05:04:57] <pavonia> g/wiki/Overchoice
[05:04:59] <michigan> entuland: who are you to say that? you dont even have your own streaming service
[05:05:12] <michigan> entuland: you probably dont even have a website
[05:05:23] <entuland> eheehh
[05:05:27] <michigan> if you do its probably really poorly designed
[05:05:35] <entuland> ahahahah
[05:05:42] <michigan> 100% guaranteed
[05:05:44] <michigan> prove me wrong then?
[05:05:47] <entuland> nah
[05:06:01] <entuland> you're just trolling and spitting ad-hominems
[05:06:02] <pavonia> In short: Choices are good, too few or too many choices are bad
[05:06:05] <michigan> no im not
[05:06:09] <michigan> ive studied design since before you were born
[05:06:14] <entuland> ahahah
[05:06:47] <entuland> I'll tell you something which is objective: nothing of what you've brought up until now has anything to do with this channel's topic
[05:07:17] <michigan> bad thing about irc is that it gives insignificant people like yourself a voice, when you haven't done anything to deserve it.
[05:07:17] <pavonia> I read that as "my knowledge is out of date" :p
[05:07:25] <michigan> entuland: well thats probably the first true thing ive heard you say.
[05:07:36] <michigan> i digress, lets all return to CSS. thanks again for the input
[05:07:48] <entuland> yw - by the way, feel free to keep thinking I'm arguing for the sake of arguing, that I'm not italian, that I don't have a website, and in particular, that the website I don't have is poorly designed
[05:10:41] <michigan> BTW i was only arguing that dark mode should be default. white mode should ofcourse be an option.
[05:11:02] <michigan> the reason i said options were bad were because you pointed out they were good, for some reason. so there might have been some misunderstanding there.
[05:11:55] <michigan> entuland: thank you for allowing me to believe in what i want!

[08:27:23] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, there?
[08:28:05] <FunkyBob> ?
[08:28:43] <Rockwood> hover not working in my code
[08:28:57] <Rockwood> code looks correct to me
[08:29:15] <Rockwood> i think selector also looks right
[08:29:43] <FunkyBob>     <ul                     <ul class="statsDetails">
[08:29:47] <FunkyBob> broken html for a start
[08:30:09] <FunkyBob> also you can't have a <ul> as a child of a <ul>
[08:30:44] <Rockwood> ok
[08:30:48] <FunkyBob> nowhere in your html do you have a ul as a child of a li... so the :hover selector doesn't match anything
[08:32:20] <Rockwood> means li having child of ul?
[08:32:48] <Rockwood> like ul > li > ul l
[08:32:50] <Rockwood> like ul > li > ul
[08:32:57] <FunkyBob> > means direct child of
[08:33:47] <FunkyBob> sorry... I mistyped before
[08:33:57] <FunkyBob> your selector is: .statsDetails li:hover ul
[08:34:06] <FunkyBob> but nowhere in your HTML is there a ul that is a descendant of a li
[08:37:15] <Rockwood> yes solved
[08:37:17] <Rockwood> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq
[08:37:48] <Rockwood> am right this time?
[08:38:20] <Rockwood> one more question
[08:39:26] <Rockwood> anymore keyword could be alternative of hover here?
[08:39:33] <FunkyBob>     <ul                     <ul class="statsDetails">
[08:39:36] <FunkyBob> you still have the broken html
[08:39:41] <FunkyBob> in fact
[08:39:43] <FunkyBob> nothing has changed
[08:39:53] <FunkyBob> did you forget to save and give a new link?
[08:39:54] <Rockwood> but hover works
[08:40:46] <Rockwood> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq oops sorry now i have done correction ther e
[08:41:45] <Rockwood> view was smaller that why i can't seen that now i improved the html
[08:41:51] <Rockwood> its works now
[08:41:54] <FunkyBob> fix your html FIRST
[08:42:01] <Rockwood> done
[08:42:16] <Rockwood>                         <li>First Stat</li>
[08:42:16] <Rockwood>                         <ul>
[08:42:29] <Rockwood> i removed extra <ul
[08:44:20] <Rockwood> what kind of alternative of hover i can use here in my current code
[08:44:39] <FunkyBob> again, you can't have <ul> as a direct child of <ul>
[08:45:09] <Rockwood> means i have to add li
[08:45:15] <Rockwood> in css code
[08:46:03] <Rockwood> like ul > li
[08:46:16] <FunkyBob> broken html is broken html
[08:47:31] <Rockwood> what should be there then?
[08:47:43] <FunkyBob> the only allowable child of a <ul> is a <li>
[08:48:07] <Rockwood> okay
[08:48:25] <Rockwood> means on li i have define class instead of ul
[08:48:30] <Rockwood> am right thinking?
[08:48:43] <FunkyBob> you don't have a class on your ul, so am not sure what you mean
[08:48:48] <FunkyBob> on your nested ul, that is
[08:50:06] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/c1cebd2e5e794e4509c81aabfde280cc#file-hover-jsx-L5 on this?
[08:50:34] <FunkyBob> right.. there's no class there now... so I don't know what you're talking about moving
[08:50:50] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/c1cebd2e5e794e4509c81aabfde280cc#file-hover-jsx-L3 but i have class on this
[08:51:16] <FunkyBob> yes...
[08:51:26] <FunkyBob> i'm lost as to which class you think you need to move, and why
[08:51:37] <Rockwood> no
[08:51:44] <Rockwood> i am not thinking about move it
[08:52:16] <FunkyBob> 03:35 < Rockwood> means on li i have define class instead of ul
[08:52:30] <Rockwood> forget it
[08:52:36] <FunkyBob> what does that mean, then?
[08:52:36] <Rockwood> its clear to me
[08:53:18] <FunkyBob> ok
[08:53:26] <FunkyBob> do you mean you'll have to change the selector?
[08:53:39] <Rockwood> actually that time i was thinking you are suggesting about ul's class name shift to next uls
[08:53:46] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, yes
[08:54:48] <FunkyBob> yeah, it will need to change...
[08:55:14] <Rockwood> ok
[08:55:30] <Rockwood> on second ul?
[08:55:48] <Rockwood> means on inner ul?
[08:56:07] <Rockwood> on child ul
[08:56:48] <FunkyBob> well, as you ahve it currently it's "ul as direct descendant of element with class statsDetails when it's hovered"
[08:56:53] <FunkyBob> but it won't be a direct descendant
[08:57:14] <FunkyBob> so you could replace "> ul"  with "> li > ul"
[08:57:26] <FunkyBob> I'm assuming you are planning to go to multiple levels of nesting
[08:57:58] <Rockwood> no
[08:58:11] <Rockwood> just for popup
[08:58:44] <Rockwood> popup should be responsible for show the more details
[08:58:48] <Rockwood> nothing else
[08:59:49] <FunkyBob> so when someone hovers anywhere in the list, no matter which item, all nested lists should appear?
[09:00:16] <Rockwood> yes
[09:00:34] <Rockwood> one step nested
[09:00:40] <Rockwood> not more
[09:01:25] <Rockwood> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq css not accepting that selector now
[09:02:00] <FunkyBob> but as  you said you won't be nesting further, there's no need to restrict to "one step, not more"
[09:02:15] <Rockwood> okay
[09:02:16] <FunkyBob> before we go further
[09:02:35] <FunkyBob> please click in the HTML pane... hit ctrl-A (or cmd-A on mac, whatever).. and shift-TAB
[09:02:50] <FunkyBob> also, you still haven't unbroken your html

[14:54:55] <ztuzr> Does someone know why the PDF printer in common browsers(Firefox, Chrome) saves puts the full image into the PDF despite It being scaled down with CSS?
[14:56:12] <ztuzr> For example If you have a like 4x 4 MB images on your page the end resulting PDF file ends with 16 MB in size, despite the images being scaled.
[14:56:38] <ztuzr> *ends up
[14:58:43] <entuland> probably they're just creating a new image with the actual displayed resolution, probably just to optimize the way more common case of larger images scaled down
[14:59:02] <hassoon> gggpkm: manipulating css? what are you up to ?
[15:02:05] <entuland> ztuzr, also, which are the steps you area using to save to PDF? are you going through the print step?
[15:03:54] <ztuzr> entuland, simply pressing ctrl + p, then printing with the dialog. Then when I inspect the generated PDF tree I see image being attached in It's original size.
[15:04:47] <entuland> some hits I've found seem to hint at some settings buried somewhere for that "save to PDF" option, which indeed should be built-in

[15:14:05] <entuland> no, you're good, I just misread your messages and I also had the wrong impression that they where optimizing images scaled down - which is of course possible
[15:14:08] <entuland> but they don't
[15:15:30] *** Joins: Alex123 (~Adium@cpe-76-91-121-195.socal.res.rr.com)
[15:15:31] <entuland> considering that there are no settings whatsoever to affect that, it's probably just matter of compromises - they had to choose one behavior, and your images scaled down could be interpreted "the full image is desired here, if they wanted to save on data / size / whatever, they'd have used a smaller image to begin with" or something
[15:16:18] <entuland> which of course is something you can do, serving different image resolutions to different viewports (check SRCSET)
[15:24:49] <ztuzr> entuland, problem is as soon you have external images you basically are required to rehost them because you need to rescale them. I think I'll just add some kind of toggle to hide with a warning to hide large images. Just need to figure out how to efficiently read the metadata.
[15:26:33] <hassoon> ztuzr: you can see how a webpage looks like in print mode, in runtime, meaning you can inspect it in that mode
[15:26:53] <hassoon> ztuzr: lolike that you can get a better understanding on what's going on with the print view
[15:26:57] <hassoon> like that *
[15:27:56] <ztuzr> hassoon, well the image is properly scaled in the preview.
[15:28:25] <hassoon> ztuzr: make us a fiddle anyway
[15:29:25] <entuland> how are you getting external images that you aren't hosting? are you hotlinking them?
[15:31:00] <entuland> also, not sure why you're worried about the heavy PDF - by the time chrome is able to create the PDF, the amount of data is already downloaded
[15:31:04] *** mrs_mwsb is now known as p_stampy
[15:31:05] <entuland> which is that matters the most
[15:31:29] <entuland> if it matters at all
[15:31:53] <ztuzr> fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/b0xp65jn/
[15:32:31] <ztuzr> Well the problem how you postprocess the PDF after downloading, you cann't really send like ~50MB via mail and also tough to upload somehwere
[15:33:17] <entuland> I'm not sure if you're on the provider end or on the consumer end in this case
[15:33:39] <ztuzr> Both somehow, I'm using the software and also developing It
[15:33:48] <entuland> which software?
[15:34:32] <entuland> cause context matters a lot here - you could create the PDF yourself if you need control over the settings
[15:37:36] <ztuzr> Well It's mainly a company organization software so there are some entities like articles, tasks, etc edited by an interactive text editor with C# on backend and ts on frontend.
[15:38:05] <ztuzr> But I'm not gonna go down the sinkhole working with PDFs in those languages IMO the libraries are beyond awful for this.
[15:39:28] <ztuzr> I think the best option for the future to work with something like Markdown behind the scenes and generate the PDF from valid Markdown I think.
[15:42:10] <entuland> not sure what to suggest, there are surely ways to get a decent PDF size out of super heavy pages, but if you can't change the SRCs that are displayed (that is, getting rid of the downscaling), then you can't 100% get rid of someone just hitting ctrl+p and printing to pdf right away
[15:42:36] <entuland> even if you give them a big fat button to get the _good_ pdf generated by your own page
[15:43:05] <entuland> html2pdf and other solutions could be taken in account

[21:15:22] <entuland> you fixed the stray textless LI but you're still applying the hover to the parent UL
[21:15:31] <entuland> apply it to the parent LI instead
[21:16:14] <entuland> change ".statsDetails:hover li > ul" to ".statsDetails li:hover > ul" - but make sure you fully understand why and how those two differ

[21:18:36] <Rockwood> awesome
[21:18:40] <Rockwood> works fine
[21:19:11] <entuland> sure it does, but can you tell with certainty why?
[21:19:39] <entuland> would you be able to describe with words the meaning of both selectors?
[21:19:39] <Rockwood> yes i understand we need the proper chain for call anything
[21:20:10] <entuland> what about the ">", do you know why it's there and whether it's necessary or suggested and why?
[21:20:26] <Rockwood> statsDetails's li having ul selector
[21:20:30] <Rockwood> its meaning
[21:20:50] <entuland> no, definitely not clear enough to understand whether you fully get what that means
[21:22:14] *** Joins: a-865 (~fmcz@24.50.25.137)
[21:22:14] <Rockwood> then?
[21:23:02] <Rockwood> Descendant selector
[21:23:25] <Rockwood> oops Child combinator
[21:23:31] <entuland> _direct_ descendant, or child combinator, yes
[21:23:34] <Rockwood> second one is correct
[21:23:42] <Rockwood> lol
[21:23:46] <Rockwood> both are correct
[21:23:52] <Rockwood> am right?
[21:24:00] <entuland> no
[21:24:12] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors
[21:24:20] <entuland> if you omit the ">" and have a third level, wouldn't behave as you'd intend, I'll show you

[21:26:57] *** Joins: drej (~drej@user/drej)
[21:27:35] <entuland> oh, you meant whether you could call it "child combinator" or "direct descendant"
[21:27:48] <entuland> sure, you can call them both ways, but the official name is "child combinator"
[21:28:25] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@pc-223-49-214-201.cm.vtr.net)
[21:29:03] <entuland> anyways, what I wanted to point out is that in the first example I've shown you the other day, I used the child combinator to make sure that only the immediately next level became visible on hover
[21:29:47] <entuland> some suggest _always_ using the child combinator unless you know you don't want to, but probably most don't bother and there isn't any meaningful performance in most of the cases
[21:30:45] <Rockwood> thanks
[21:30:53] <entuland> as in, instead of ".correct li:hover > ul", using the more specific ".correct > li:hover > ul"
[21:30:56] <Rockwood> you are very sound in css
[21:31:14] <entuland> too kind
[21:33:08] <Rockwood> ah nice
[21:34:24] <entuland> actually, I am wrong, I didn't use the child combinator the other day
[21:34:43] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/khpeqcot/1/ this one won't scale with nested levels beyond the second
[21:35:30] <entuland> in this one, instead, the child combinator was redundant due to the presence of a specific level-two class: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/khpeqcot
[21:36:07] <entuland> I should have swapped the two around
[21:36:54] <entuland> I should try and check my CSS better when hacking these examples away :P
[21:39:57] <Rockwood> yes
[21:40:14] <Rockwood> i am agree 100% with you
[21:41:05] <Rockwood> entuland, .correct ul means correct's ul or child ul?
[21:42:16] <entuland> correct and wrong there where just to use different class names
[21:42:27] <Rockwood> no
[21:42:41] <entuland> oh I see
[21:42:52] <Rockwood> my question is .correct ul's  approach
[21:42:56] <entuland> you are asking the meaning of ".correct ul" as a selector
[21:43:02] <Rockwood> yes
[21:43:16] <entuland> that means "any UL element descending from any element with class .correct"
[21:43:42] <entuland> no matter whether child, grandson or further down the nesting
[21:44:04] <Rockwood> ok
[21:45:18] <entuland> any UL with class "correct", as a CSS selector, would be "ul.correct"
[21:45:34] <Rockwood> i am lucky i got nice way and nice people
[21:45:56] <entuland> eh, but you should try and practice with those things until you're confident you fully get the meaning of those selectors
[21:46:08] <Rockwood> okay

[21:46:18] <Rockwood> css is real play of seletors just
[21:46:18] <entuland> feel free to practice here, but show your best attempts at wording the exact meaning
[21:46:22] <Rockwood> selectors
[21:46:38] <entuland> yes, fully understanding the selectors is vital not to go nuts
[21:47:08] <entuland> far more important than remembering all the nitty gritty details of flex, grid and various other techniques
[21:48:12] <Rockwood> i am bit know flex too
[21:48:39] <Rockwood> css having grid thing too i am listening first time
[21:48:44] <Rockwood> let me chk
[21:48:51] <Rockwood> from mozilla
[21:51:31] <entuland> Rockwood, no, media queries are important and useful but they're nowhere as important as fully understanding the selectors - you can make a fluid responsive design without using media queries just fine
