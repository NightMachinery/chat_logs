[12:49:48] <rendar> why i get this error? https://bpa.st/MHWA
[12:52:04] <emanuele6> because, in awk,   if (A) || (B) { C }   is not valid (as in most programming languages that use C-like syntax.)

[12:52:42] <emanuele6> either use ((A) || (B)) or, in your case, (A || B)
[12:52:47] <rendar> i see thanks
[12:53:14] <rendar> it seems `((A) || (B))` has the same problem too
[12:53:16] <emanuele6> also i just noticed that you are using  if  outside of a block
[12:53:22] <tirnanog> and return without a function.
[12:53:23] <emanuele6> that is nonsense
[12:53:40] <emanuele6> yeah
[12:53:49] <emanuele6> utter nonsense
[12:54:05] <rendar> never used awk, any help?
[12:54:07] <tirnanog> perhaps you meant: '$2 == "b" || $3 == "c" { exit 1; }'
[12:54:07] <emanuele6> and b and c are not defined
[12:54:14] <rendar> tirnanog, thanks, ok
[12:54:23] <emanuele6> b and c where variables there
[12:54:31] <emanuele6> s/where/were/
[12:54:32] <tirnanog> assuming an exit status of 1 is what you wanted (I can't actually tell).
[12:55:24] <rendar> yes
[12:56:22] <emanuele6> so "a b d" -> 1  "a b c" -> 1  "a x c" -> 1  "a a a" -> 0?
[12:56:32] <rendar> yes
