[04:20:22] <gordonfish> If I may make a suggestion, maybe a variation of readme.md that doesn't rely on powershell, as some people don't use that, but that's probably something for later (and maybe something I could contribute when this readme.md is finalized.)
[04:21:24] <gordonfish> And while I don't full on hate powershell, I'm really not a fan of verbose constructs like Copy-Item "..." -Destination "..."
[04:24:47] <gordonfish> (It'd really be nice if there was a way in PS to do something akin to cp C:\mingw64\bin\{mingw32-,g}make.exe, instead of Copy-Item "C:\mingw64\bin\mingw32-make.exe" -Destination "C:\mingw64\bin\gmake.exe")

[05:04:06] <mst> but I still don't see a use of $_ in that entire block
[05:04:21] <mst> SHIT
[05:04:24] <mst> I SEE THE PROBLEM
[05:04:39] <mst> $tempus =~ /^(.+)(\<td\>\d+\.\d+\,\d+\<\/td\>)\<td\>(\d+\.\d+\,\d+)/<\/td\>/ is actually it for once
[05:04:44] <mst> notice the unescaped /
[05:04:47] <Grinnz> aha
[05:04:54] <mst> that's an =~ i.e. an m//
[05:05:15] <mst> so that raw / without backslashing is putting the parser off entirely I bet
[05:05:33] <Grinnz> right, thats why i was guessing there was a syntax error eventually too
[05:05:42] <mst> yeah
[05:06:02] <mst> gamo: (\d+\.\d+\,\d+)/
[05:06:10] <mst> gamo: ^^ I don't think that / is meant to be there.
[05:06:37] <gamo> oooooooooh
[05:06:49] <mst> I think somebody added the <\/td\>/ bit
[05:06:56] <mst> and accidentally left that / behind
[05:07:08] <mst> and that completely trashed the compiler's ability to figure out the rest of the code
[05:07:43] <gamo> but it's workin well now
[05:08:00] <mst> eh?
[05:08:22] <gamo> yes, the error does not affect the capture
[05:08:32] <mst> with that / in there whatever your code is doing, it's nothing to do with what it's supposed to do
[05:08:42] <mst> you may be accidentally getting the right result, but it's broken

[05:26:48] <mst> might help you here
[05:26:48] <gamo> so the alternative is to use a module?
[05:27:02] <mst> perl is just a virtual machine. CPAN is the language.
[05:27:18] <gamo> a perfect phrase
[05:27:50] <gordonfish> { Re: <mst> parsing html with regexps is a perversion } Didn't they used to flog people for that?

[19:22:36] <rindolf> karjala: (@s,)?
[19:22:53] <karjala> neat
[19:22:54] <karjala> thanks
[19:23:08] <rindolf> karjala: and why do you need that?
[19:24:49] <karjala> I don't, just wondered because I wrote a sub for fun that evaluates differently in scalar context, if the sub returns @s from if it  returned @s[0..$#s].
[19:25:25] <karjala> Actually it returns either (5, @s) or (5, (@s,))
[19:25:51] <Grinnz> so, none of these are "lists"
[19:25:58] <Grinnz> they are just different operators
[19:26:13] <karjala> Oh, I remember that discussion
[19:26:13] <Grinnz> an array in scalar context behaves differently from a comma in scalar context, or an array slice in scalar context
[19:26:30] <Grinnz> there are many other operators which may behave like scalar comma
[19:26:33] <Grinnz> but not all
[19:27:28] <Grinnz> so basically, first step is to define what behavior you want in scalar context, then use the operator that provides that behavior
[19:28:22] *** Quits: diskin (~diskin@87.117.56.119) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[19:28:41] <Grinnz> and *ideally*, you document that the function is only to be called in list context, and so if it gets called in scalar context the user gets to keep all three halves
[19:28:51] <Grinnz> (i.e. scalar context is undefined behavior)
[19:29:04] <karjala> Thanks!
[19:29:07] <karjala> That was enlightening
[19:29:25] *** Joins: diskin (~diskin@87.117.60.162)
[19:29:58] <karjala> So in scalar context a comma in parentheses is a comma operator, and in list context a comma in parentheses is a list separator? Am i right?
[19:30:02] <Grinnz> unlike list context it's rather difficult to accidentally call a function in scalar context, so this design works out usually
[19:30:17] <Grinnz> karjala: pretty much, although you could refer to both as "a comma operator"
[19:30:24] <Grinnz> but yes, the operator does different things
[19:30:33] <Grinnz> and the parentheses don't affect it
[19:38:45] <mst> if people keep calling my list context function in scalar context
[19:38:59] <mst> I change 'return $x, $y, $z;' to 'return () = ($x, $y, $z);'

[19:51:13] <karjala> @s[0..$#s] *is* a list though, right? I think it is, because in scalar context evaluates to its last value.
[19:51:28] <karjala> last element*
[19:51:39] <mst> eval: sub f { return ('a', 'b'); } sub g { return( () = ('a', 'b') ) } [ scalar f(), scalar g() ]
[19:51:43] <perlbot> mst: ["b",2]
[19:53:20] <karjala> So list assignment in scalar context evaluates to the number of elements on the right, and in list context to the elements on the right (or the list on the right)
[19:53:24] <karjala> Hm
[19:53:29] <Grinnz> karjala: it's not a list - it's an array slice, which in scalar context evaluates to its last value
[19:53:36] <karjala> Okay!
[19:53:48] <Grinnz> it just has the same behavior as a scalar comma, effectively
[19:54:22] <Grinnz> whereas list assignment in scalar context (mst's example) has effectively the same behavior as an array in scalar context (number of elements)

[19:56:37] <karjala> So the definition of a list is only "things separated by comas that happen to be in list context"?
[19:56:44] <mst> karjala: the reason for this is to ensure that @x[0,1,2] behaves the same as ($x[0], $x[1], $x[2])
[19:56:57] <Grinnz> none of these are definitions of list; they *yield* lists in list context
[19:57:10] <Grinnz> everything returns a list in list context
[19:57:18] <karjala> Aha
[19:57:32] <Grinnz> the list is the series of zero or more values that are sent into the stack
[19:58:21] <karjala> So even nothing returns a list in list context
[19:58:28] <Grinnz> correct, the empty list
[19:58:40] <Grinnz> which is what return; does
[19:58:53] <karjala> How come I can't write @s = ; then?
[19:58:59] <Grinnz> because the parser doesn't like it
[19:59:17] <karjala> ok
[19:59:42] <Grinnz> the parser requires a "value" to follow the assignment operator
[19:59:51] <mst> karjala: because = is a binary operator so you need to have a left hand side and a right hand side
[19:59:52] <Grinnz> () is a workaround to put no values there
[20:00:06] <mst> karjala: pretty much no language would allow that
[20:00:16] <mst> (there's probably one somewhere but I'm just going to not think about that ;)
[20:00:27] <jabberwok> Intercal ?
[20:01:01] * mst increases the gain on the 'not thinking about that' field
[20:01:19] <karjala> Even Perl 6 doesn't allow that?
[20:01:24] <karjala> Did I guess the one?
[20:01:31] <Grinnz> the assignment operator requiring parentheses is what most often makes people think parentheses make a list. but you can disprove that connection with something as simple as push
[20:01:37] <Grinnz> and also return
[20:02:10] <huf> or []
[20:02:18] <huf> you dont need [()]
[20:02:29] <mst> I don't remember raku allowing it either
[20:02:33] <Grinnz> and similarly `my @foo = 42;` is a perfectly valid list assignment, since there's no precedence issue with a single item
[20:03:09] <karjala> Aha! One of my greatest unresolved mysteries has been solved.

[20:46:47] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: what happens if you write a small script that triggers one of those warnings without anything but a specific class loaded?
[20:47:21] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: that would give us a start on tracking it down
[20:47:44] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. thanks. I'll go search deeper, if this isn't expected by you either.
[20:49:55] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: I don't have something usng it handy but that's definitely not how I understand it to be supposed to work and it's not how I remember it working last time I used it
[20:50:19] <mst> ehuelsmann[m]: so I would definitely say "something has gone odd"

[20:50:40] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. It wasn't my recollection either, but I wanted to be sure before sinking any time into it.
[20:50:56] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'll search more. thanks for the confirmation!

[21:26:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> mst: After fiddling with Carp::Clan locally, I understand it now: I passed in a pattern that doesn't match the local package's name (I passed "PGObject::" when the local package calling package was called PGObject). Carp::Clan adds the name of the calling function to the error message (in which it differs from Carp). The call came from a package not-matched by the pattern in the import and the "carp" function itself is an anonymous sub()
[21:26:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> allocated by Carp::Clan from its own package... So, it prepended "Carp::Clan::__ANON__()"
[21:26:31] <mst> ahhhh
[21:26:36] <ehuelsmann[m]> I fixed the regex.

[21:27:07] <ehuelsmann[m]> yup. that's the way I did it now.
[21:27:23] <ehuelsmann[m]> thanks for the help!
[21:28:33] <Grinnz> \b at the end would also work
