[00:23:05] <pyzozord> On the app side I'd fail at security almost for sure also mvvm and mvp are some weird spinoffs of mvc that I am not familira with
[00:23:29] <alycidyne> pyzozord: mvvm = model-view-viewmodel, mvp = model-view-presenter

[00:25:02] <pyzozord> but might be that mvvm and mvp are more native to android or apple, and they are common knowledge in those environments
[00:25:03] <alycidyne> pyzozord: mvc may be simple, but mva is more flexible and usable for me personally
[00:25:17] <pyzozord> alycidyne: what do you work in daily?

[00:26:25] <pyzozord> alycidyne: I prefer the term, temporary, unpaid vacations or funemployed ;) It's rare that programmers stay unempoyed for long if it's not their choice

[00:28:00] <pyzozord> Izem: the one you are the most familiar with

[00:28:25] <pyzozord> Izem: otherwise python has low entry curve
[00:28:39] <pyzozord> Izem: or javascript
[00:29:07] <Izem> hmm, python doesn't have build tools really? just a package manager?
[00:29:18] <Izem> also, my bad I should've said os platform
[00:29:21] <pyzozord> Izem: that part of python is pretty ugly actually
[00:29:33] <Izem> what's npm like? I'm curious
[00:29:36] <pyzozord> the package managers and build systems in python are quite messy
[00:29:44] * alycidyne sighs
[00:29:49] <pyzozord> npm is easy, dead simple actually

[00:40:56] <climatechange> also, I don't know how to scale things
[00:40:58] <pyzozord> Izem: not sure if always json, but I think often. Als regarding query, they often use map/reduce for quering
[00:41:27] <Izem> is nosql a recognized term by the db community?
[00:41:34] <Izem> dbs are old
[00:41:46] <pyzozord> yeah I think so
[00:41:50] <climatechange> Izem: yes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL
[00:41:53] <pyzozord> is pretty recognized term in general
[00:42:13] <Izem> what did they call this in the 80s then?

[02:54:04] <davve_> what in particular isnt clicking? redis is a database ... which is part server and part client

[04:16:05] <normerns> the numbers come in pairs, one of them is the encrypted byte and the other is the flags that decided what is done with it. in theory you just have to read that flag byte, parse it and apply the same steps that were taken to encrypt the byte in reverse i think? but how could you do that programtically?

[05:27:47] <hjf> so after my meltdown the other day i started looking at the tickets in the jira board and take some i could fix myself
[05:27:58] <hjf> i created 2 PRs
[05:28:01] <hjf> yay me
[05:28:13] <hjf> also i was looking at all of this code and ...holy shit this is terrible code
[05:28:25] <hjf> i thought this was written by people that know more than me
[05:28:39] <hjf> but turns out it's written by fucking amateurs
[05:29:12] <hjf> case in point: they call 'passport.autenticate()' in every router.get() in expressjs
[05:29:12] <AlexDelarge> sounds like the firmware for my insulin pump -- i wrote better code in c back in high school
[05:29:41] <AlexDelarge> like everything is an afterthought
[05:29:47] <hjf> dude what the fuck? express has a thing to "do something to every call"
[05:29:57] <hjf> it's called a middleware
[05:30:21] <hjf> literally you don't need to authenticate every fucking endpoint. you use a middleware for authenticating all requests coming in
[05:30:42] <hjf> do these people not realize that when you have to copy and paste YOUR CODE IS WRONG
[05:30:49] <hjf> i'm mad now
[05:30:59] <ehnet3d> if i open a directory and want to tehn read contents, is the entire state copied from the "open" call or  can files pop in/out while i'm calling getdents
[05:31:12] <hjf> not at the code. i'm mad at myself
[05:31:52] <hjf> for having a meltdown over this shit and it turns out i'm not that much of an idiot after all

[09:49:03] <CoderGuy> odd question, in html you have ID's for each Tag, you also can set a class for each tag, but in other languages like QT they use setObjectName,  just curious is something like setID universally understood the same way ID is understood for an html tag, or is setObjectID better?
[09:49:42] *** Quits: Doffi (~doffi@91.132.197.188) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:51:40] <yitz> CoderGuy: IDs usually apply to things, or "objects". One is just more vervose than the other
[09:52:05] <CoderGuy> right but can you think of a conflict that might arise with a class having setID instead of setObjectID
[09:52:19] <CoderGuy> like is there a case when setID might literally have to refer to some ID other then the style attribute of the class?
[09:52:39] <CoderGuy> which made me ponder maybe setStyleID is even better i'm really confused
[09:54:22] <pavonia> IDs do not only refer to styles, they are supposed to uniquely identify objects
[09:55:03] <CoderGuy> pavonia, okay so what is the ideal function name for something that sets said ID? is it, setID, setObjectID?

[09:59:02] <CoderGuy> but that still leaves me wondering, what function would setID be used for?
[09:59:39] <CoderGuy> yeah I still like setObjectID though imma go with that

[10:06:11] *** Joins: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck)
[10:06:27] <Quietwalker> I've got an object which always has 1 or more values in it, to populate a dropdown.  Later a decision is made on this value.  However, if there is only 1 value for a given object, we don't show that option because ... it's not a choice.  What's most likely is that we won't even persist that value because it's a no-op.  So there will be 0 rows.
[10:06:42] <Quietwalker> However, more choices /could/ be added in the future.
[10:07:03] <Quietwalker> so it'll go from 1 choice (and 0 rows) directly to 2 choices (and 2 rows).
[10:07:14] <Quietwalker> ah, but it's not an either or. It's a permutation.
[10:07:24] <Quietwalker> so you could pick choice 1, choice 2, or choice 1 & 2.
[10:08:04] <Quietwalker> and the standard case is that they want all possible choices, in 99% of the scenarios.
[10:09:00] <Quietwalker> when I write to the database then, I need something that indicates "all choices are selected, and if you add new ones, include those too," without explicitly creating a row for each permutation, because I don't know what new values could be added.
[10:09:50] <Quietwalker> so you end up using something dumb like -1 for the id for that, because of uniqueness constraints disallowing nulls.
[10:10:06] <Quietwalker> and if you do it the right way, it's just super tedious and gets you nothing.

[12:23:39] <Valware> Ignore your opponent's proposition, which was intended to refer to a particular thing. Rather, understand it in some quite different sense, and then refute it. Attack something different than that which was asserted <- that's steering away from said argument :D

[13:19:33] <pyzozord> no_gravity: graft?
[13:19:46] <xerxes> archie: if you want to return an array from a function which will be accessed later, you can't use the first declaration in C or C++.

[13:20:02] <archie> xerxes I know. Does it play a role here? I mean, I'm pretty sure new uses the heap. Does char test[size] without new use it as well?

[13:20:12] <xerxes> archie: no.
[13:20:14] <no_gravity> pyzozord: Hmm.. that is the first time I hear that word.
[13:20:33] <xerxes> archie: if you don't use `new`, no memory is allocated on the heap. i think you

[13:21:31] <xerxes> archie: avoid variable length arrays preferably.
[13:21:45] <mrig> pikapika: simple though, you just pour in a little salt to assist ionisation and put an electronic audio signal across the flame, the flame will not only generate an actual audio version of the signal, a very accurate one, it also amplifies it.
[13:22:00] <archie> xerxes uhm. I have another question then. If I do have a string (eg. string test;), where is the content allocated, stack or heap? I guess stack, right?
[13:22:04] <pikapika> mrig, like any normal table salt?
[13:22:05] <mrig> an acoustic version of I should say.
[13:22:19] <xerxes> archie: in C++?
[13:22:19] <pulse> archie, std::string manages memory internally on the heap

[13:26:31] <mrig> same principle.
[13:26:49] <pikapika> Thanks, I'll try the experiment and read more about it
[13:27:02] <archie> I have to fix a memory leak btw, I am pretty sure the cause is a char[] allocated using new, which size comes from a std::string. Since as we said above, std::string is stored in the heap, the proper way to do so is to use delete[] rather than remove the new, right?
[13:27:09] <vdamewood> pikapika: yes? You mean, like はい?
[13:27:12] <nisstyre> you can make air move by using the pressure difference a flame creates I guess
[13:27:13] <archie> otherwise I guess bad things may happen at runtime
[13:27:18] <nisstyre> if you can make air move you can make sounds
[13:27:28] <pyzozord> archie: I'm not 100% sure but I think that for example static strings are kept in .data sections of the executable and then they will be loaded into the code section of memory during execution, that's why you can't modify them by default

[13:30:03] <pikapika> vdamewood, horny
[13:30:11] <vdamewood> archie: There's a lot to unpack there. 1: Don't use new and delete. Use smart pointers. 2: "std::string is stored in the heap" is an internal implementation detail of std::string. You shouldn't have to care. use delete on things your new yourself.
[13:30:48] <archie> pyzozord yup, but since std::string is managed in heap, if I want to copy the content in a char[] I do guess that new char[] is the proper way, there might me not enough space in stack
[13:31:06] <vdamewood> archie: So, for example if you have something like this: std::string myString["This is a long string with lots of characters.
[13:31:09] <vdamewood> oops
[13:31:49] <mrig> C++ fun++ :D
[13:32:00] <vdamewood> archie: So, for example if you have something like this: std::string myString("This is a long string with lots of characters.") the std::string object itself will be on the stack, but it will have a pointer to a buffer on the heap. the std::string object itself will deal with deleting the buffer.

[13:36:19] <vdamewood> archie: 1: why are you copying to a char[]? 2: Unless you know the exact size at compile time, heap allocation is pretty much the only way to do it.
[13:36:20] <pyzozord> so it will kind of use double memory I think, unless c++ compilers optimize that out, which is possible

[19:51:24] <pyzozord> I think one of my fav movies are actualy Alien, all three :P But first by far. It's not like critically aclaimd. And I'm not into horrors tbh I hate them.
[19:52:45] <pyzozord> Just B class / older / budget movies with good acting and good cinematography and good practical effects
[19:52:57] <pyzozord> could watch them all day
[19:52:58] <pulse> my favorite movie is fear&loathing in las vegas, or pulp fiction
[19:53:04] <pulse> the original starwars trilogy is superb as well
[19:53:22] <pulse> as for tv shows my favorite starts and ends with seinfeld :p
[19:53:37] <pyzozord> yeah pretty much everything by Tarantino
[19:54:01] <sandman13> Never bothered with Star Wars or Star Trek
[19:54:01] <xerxes> pulse: i like Seinfeld too.
[19:54:06] <GeDaMo> "B class / older / budget movies with good acting and good cinematography and good practical effects" Tremors! :P
[19:54:15] <pulse> the original star wars is like, masterclass in storytelling

[19:54:47] <sandman13> "saga"-esque movie that I like is Lord of The Rings Triology
[19:54:49] <pulse> xerxes, same. i mean, some get close. allo' allo is the one i'd point out
[19:55:10] <pulse> i liked it crowd a lot too, but it's a bit too quirky to really be in the top spot
[19:55:16] <pulse> and only fools and horses
[19:55:35] <pulse> but seinfeld is top notch. just perfect cast chemistry, and bloody brilliant writing

[19:56:07] <pulse> allo allo is brilliant
[19:56:18] <pulse> it's just impossibly good
[19:56:27] <pulse> still, i like seinfeld more. but i think allo allo is a 2nd
[19:56:38] <pulse> monty python is mostly an acquired taste tbh
[19:56:45] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: yeah looks like something up my lane :D I'm that big on horror and gore movies tbh, but if a movie is good then it's good
[19:56:45] <pulse> it's british humor turned to 11
[19:57:08] <GeDaMo> Apparently there are a whole lot of sequels to Tremors but I've never seen them
[19:57:10] <xerxes> pulse: once i had to sit through a Monty Python movie. that was not a good experience. i didn't find anything funny. clever, yeah. but not funny.
[19:57:14] <GeDaMo> The original is excellent though
[19:57:19] <pulse> i'm pretty sure allo' allo would offend modern audiences though
[19:57:23] <pulse> it's not very politically correct
[19:57:30] <pulse> in fact it makes fun of almost every single politically correct thing in existence
[19:57:41] <pulse> but it does so in a humorous way
[19:57:54] <xerxes> pulse: Seinfeld had exceptionally brilliant actors in George and Kramer.
[19:58:08] <pulse> xerxes, all 4 were great, and not only that, all supporting cast was great too
[19:58:16] <pulse> the guy who played mr. peterman cracks me up
[19:58:21] <pulse> or jackie chiles
[19:58:29] <pulse> and newman. god, newman
[19:58:29] <xerxes> pulse: Jerry was not a very good actor.
[19:58:36] <pulse> xerxes, that only makes it funnier imo
[19:58:40] <pulse> he played himself
[19:58:42] <xerxes> pulse: Newman's character was the best.
[19:58:48] <pulse> yeah newman was fantastic
[19:59:11] <pulse> i mean the chemistry in seinfeld is just above and beyond what you usually find in any show
[19:59:25] <xerxes> pulse: unlike other sitcoms, there are very few jokes which are forced in Seinfeld.
[19:59:39] <pulse> it all just fits together. everyone's neurotic, it's a perfect caricature of modern society
[19:59:42] <xerxes> pulse: everything fits.

[20:27:02] <xerxes> pulse: i hate stuff like that. they are kinda like surrogate activism.
[20:27:15] <pulse> and the funny thing is by focusing on code, you end up with more money than if you focused on money
[20:27:35] <pulse> xerxes, two shows that were recommended to me "because i'm a techie" were mr. robot and halt&catch fire, and i hated both

[20:30:44] <pulse> xerxes, yes, it fetishizes gore

[22:39:52] <pikapika> tarsier, hi
[22:40:09] <GeDaMo> I'm just reading https://bootstrapping.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
[22:42:02] <CuriousErnestBro> programmers are opinionated
[22:42:20] <CuriousErnestBro> it sucks that they are often wrong and present their misguided opinions as fact to beginners
[22:42:30] <CuriousErnestBro> also their value judgements are often completely out of wack

[22:50:10] <InPhase> CuriousErnestBro: Good demo of your description.  ;)
[22:52:10] <InPhase> CuriousErnestBro: If you perhaps say things like "Some" in front of opinions like that, then your statement would not be provably wrong.  It takes only the existence of one programmer who is not opinionated for everything you said to be incorrect.  And more than one such programmer exists.

[22:54:49] <InPhase> CuriousErnestBro: Some is easy, but doesn't say much.  Many says you think it is a lot.  Too many is a value judgment, that you think it should be a smaller number.  "Most" is a stronger statement about a population, which can be counterargued if people think the distribution is different.  But declarations about all are almost always just wrong in large numbers of people.
