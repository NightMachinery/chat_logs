[02:32:43] <walkrflocka> 5.13.4-arch2-1
[02:32:52] <sheep> so it's not a kernel version mismatch

[03:27:08] <ParsnipChicken> Hi, so I'm having a little bit of network trouble. I am running arch on a virtual machine that is connected to wifi. How do I get it to communicate with the other machines logged into my local network? I am using NetworkManager currently.
[03:27:27] <NetSysFire> how did you configure the network of the virtual machine?
[03:27:35] <NetSysFire> is it passthrough of a wifi card or a bridge or nat or whatever?
[03:27:50] <ParsnipChicken> Do you mean outside arch?
[03:28:00] <NetSysFire> no, specific to the vm
[03:28:10] <NetSysFire> also is it a virtualbox vm or something else?
[03:28:16] <ParsnipChicken> appears to be nat
[03:28:18] <ParsnipChicken> virtualbox
[03:30:48] <ParsnipChicken> I can provide the output of `ip neighbor show` if that would help
[03:31:34] <NetSysFire> no it just cant be NAT
[03:31:47] <NetSysFire> i am not sure about virtualbox in specific but i am fairly sure it also supports bridging
[03:32:17] <ParsnipChicken> Yes, there is a "bridged adapter option". I will try that.

[04:28:50] <quantum_> Logical volume question.  I have an lv on the host, which contains a kvm virtual machine with the OS.  That VM inside the lv, is an xfs partition for boot, and an lv for the main filesystem.
[04:29:53] <quantum_> I've resized the lv on the host.  I boot to a Live CD in the guest to resize the LV with the main filesystem, but it still thinks it's at 30GB, not the new 50GB.

[18:04:23] <Konomi> I might just dd to my second empty hard drive and deal with it
[18:04:39] <Isaac_S> Hi, have I not got my drive connected in properly? I bought a fresh ssd today and it's not appearing when I look at the block devices.

[18:05:12] <Konomi> it'll be on a hard drive but at least it'll be a sata port
[18:05:20] <aphirst> Isaac_S, if you're sure it's connected correctly and you're sure your motherboard is compatible with the interface, and there's no entry in lsblk, something must be wrong
[18:05:27] <aphirst> Isaac_S, what kind of SSD and what kind of connector
[18:06:24] <Konomi> Isaac_S: if you're using lsblk it won't show anything without a file system
[18:06:35] <Isaac_S> oh
[18:06:36] <Konomi> check fdisk -l  if it doesn't appear there

[18:06:43] <Konomi> then you're in trouble
[18:06:51] <aphirst> lsblk shows block devices with no filesystems just fine
[18:07:04] <Isaac_S> I think it's the laptop connector (it's an old laptop so it could be a damaged connector)
[18:07:11] <Isaac_S> because even fdisk doesn't show it
[18:07:12] <Konomi> aphirst: in my experience it hasn't but I can't check right now
[18:07:21] <Konomi> Isaac_S: then you have an issue
[18:07:24] <aphirst> Isaac_S, another thing to check is the BIOS, whether that port is disabled

[18:14:24] <Isaac_S> i think so yeah, the ssd is thin so there's enough space for it not to be seated properly on the connector

[21:58:51] <sqrt> `Now this pipewire needs some additional packages to support pulseaudio (pipewire-pulse) or say wlroots-based window manager like sway. For this to work, you need “portals” using xdg-desktop-portal with a “backend”,`
