[00:09:49] <xnaas> Activ8: presumably because hosting any of them falls well outside of their stated goal of "for first-time IRC users"
[00:10:10] <Activ8> yes
[00:11:11] <xnaas> Personally, I think a (collapsed-by-default?) section for web-based or "advanced" clients would be a nice addition, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:12:37] <Activ8> uhm what was that for? was that something I commented on? I cleared by back log
[00:14:03] <xnaas> <Activ8> xnaas have you noticed on libera non of the other web clients are mentioned either just desktop one
[00:14:03] <xnaas> <Activ8> ones*
[00:14:16] <Activ8> oh yeh I remember that one
[00:14:20] <xnaas> :P
[00:14:26] <xnaas> it's ok, my memory is shit too
[00:14:43] <Activ8> yeh you are right a collection of web products would be nice
[00:14:47] <Activ8> speak to jess?
[00:14:53] <jess> hi
[00:14:56] * xnaas not super worried about it lol
[00:15:01] <Activ8> hello jess
[00:15:03] <jess> ^^
[00:15:18] <Activ8> worried is the wrong wording I think
[00:15:44] <Activ8> uhm jess you know libera web site? is there a reason web clients are missed off?
[00:15:59] <jess> no reason
[00:16:08] <xnaas> <xnaas> https://github.com/Libera-Chat/libera-chat.github.io/pull/4
[00:16:08] <xnaas> <xnaas> > Thanks for the PR, but the client guide is meant for first-time IRC users, so clients like TL aren't for the target audience.
[00:16:26] <Activ8> ah that explains it
[00:17:03] <xnaas> chat backlogs good :P
[00:17:34] <jess> i do feel like people that use thelounge are either using someone else's instance or set up their own instance
[00:17:48] <jess> so probably already know what they're doing
[00:18:16] <Activ8> I accidently cleared my backlogs xnaas I have a backup but that means restoring and don't have anything to go back for
[00:18:19] <jess> if we've not got thelounge covered in the sasl pages that might be nice
[00:19:00] <Activ8> yes jess I think you are right.  In the channel there are a lot of new users ask questions but most are already in have it set up
