[00:45:38] <boris_> we have a VPS that we are using to host a simple web app. Currently the app is accessed through nginx.
[00:45:38] <boris_> I was thinking if by any chance I could use the VPS to configure openvpn server on it , configure it to use mullvad and then use this as a proxy for my devices.
[00:45:39] <LjL> to run those things it must sacrifice part of its openness and freedom in favor of DRM
[00:45:40] <boris_> My problem is that if I just set up openvpn all traffic of the VPS will be forwarded to Mullvad's VPN network

[03:05:40] <hentai> I want an operation to either happen, or not happen, with no state in between
[03:06:14] <Gustavo6046> That is impossible because of the file cache, which, as it turns out, is also vital for the operation of a modern computer.
[03:06:17] <hentai> And they dare take it from my mainline kernel!
[03:06:20] <Gustavo6046> Maybe it is a bad thing to have that.
[03:06:27] <Gustavo6046> Depends on the use case of course

[05:09:19] <tusko> basically no success pre-covid

[05:55:03] <Khaytsus> Could take it either way, I took it as him running debian in a VM on Windows
[05:55:05] <kfrench> I suspect all recent Intel and AMD cpus have enough hardware to run VMs at near native speed.  If you want 3d at near-native, then you'll have to do vga passthrough

[18:07:42] <phogg> Elw3: toolkits wanting to support both X and wayland need to be structured for that from the beginning. You will have to have an abstraction layer in your codebase and a point where you detect which environment is running. Or you could instead switch off at compile time.

[21:54:18] <rbox> it loads the binary, it loads the libraries, then when the binary gets to the part where it wants to execute code from the library, it just starts running code from the location the library was loaded

[23:24:54] <hojasuelta> workin on AWS certs-- this is a great intro to the concept of block level storage for example-- I thought it was a general OS concept but its more of a cloud topic-- a cloud-computing methodolgy to emulate traditional OS storage-- i.e. S3

[23:26:13] <bitskit> @hexnewbie it was. I had a macbook with ubuntu on it and switched my main to a newer thinkpad with better specs. after like, two years of use, the graphics card died so I dug the macbook out of the closet and was basically unable to install anything anymore
[23:26:16] <hojasuelta> i wasn't aware it existed until I read this cloud cert guide
