[15:47:22] <varde> A martyr is a job where you sacrifice your role to be a playmaker in some greater event. As Sun Tzu says ' have the army you control be a reason for victory '.
[15:54:14] <varde> He was a great general, but not the best, he makes a few mistakes in treating war as a set (4) when in fact it's a singular (1). Treating it like poetry when it need be literal or actual. If you don't roar, you don't for a reason. You don't simply not roar and then have order for what follows (a tactic for when you don't roar).

[15:58:27] <varde> Hiding and re-hiding is like running, it can be supportive.
[15:58:52] <varde> Running away strangely.
[15:59:41] <varde> Do not withdraw.
[16:00:42] <varde> If I say do not withdraw and then some directive... It's false because as said prior it is unwise to plot set tactics for events.
[16:00:51] <varde> So what's the best philosophy for that event?
[16:01:03] <tomathy> what event?
[16:01:07] <tomathy> superior enemy?
[16:01:34] <varde> Do not withdraw is my advice, then what do I put to be philosophical/artistic?
[16:02:10] <tomathy> do not withdraw in a methodical and precise manner, do it the way you enjoy

[16:10:30] <CaCode> Being a member of society, such that if everybody was such a member society would be a desirable environment for any member
[16:10:32] <arryana> which society?  you need to define the question a little more precisely for a meaningful answer.
[16:10:38] <varde> A good member of society is social.
[16:10:57] <CaCode> arryana, I understand, but I mean in an abstract sense
[16:11:21] <CaCode> as there is many different societies with very different values and moral systems
[16:11:47] <tomathy> good members of my body serve a purpose and fulfill it
[16:11:54] * arryana shrugs and doesn't really see the point in trying to answer an overgeneralized question
[16:12:43] <CaCode> arryana, i regret it doesn't interest you, but I understand. However I was thinking of an abstract society not a particular society
[16:13:15] <tomathy> it is too general CaCode
[16:13:43] <tomathy> i mean why dont we take one society completely different to another
[16:13:55] <tomathy> like compare ancient greece to aztecs
[16:14:08] <arryana> an 'abstract society' doesn't really help either
[16:14:23] <tomathy> for aztecs it was all about being willing to be sacrificed to the gods, in greece it was probably about how enjoyable you are to be around
[16:14:34] <CaCode> or an abstract society, thereby allowing us to discuss the properties not dependent on time and place
[16:15:16] <CaCode> if we get tied up on examples we end up debating the particular circumstances of that one society instead of discussing that which all human societes have in common
[16:15:33] <tomathy> i can call anything a society
[16:15:41] <tomathy> as long as it has parts that work together
[16:16:00] * arryana shrugs again
[16:16:00] <CaCode> if you are a member of an abstract society, doing anything that destroys that society is probably not being a good member
[16:16:20] <arryana> trying to discuss the undefined is a bit far in the direction of being so openminded that one's brain falls out, in my boojk

[16:17:00] <tomathy> then we force it to dance
[16:17:00] <CaCode> so doesnt being a good member oa society also include taking ones responsibility in assuring that the society is also a moral and good society that doesnt mistreat its members?

[18:35:35] <audrey> I can't really comment; I never fit in even with my own generation
[18:35:37] <biys> i'm taking this literature course, we're doing an analysis of this short story called "the painted door"
[18:35:54] <biys> and i used the term "cuck" to describe john (cause he is indeed a cuck, technically)
[18:35:58] <biys> i was told the term isn't appropriate
[18:36:23] <biys> John literally invited a dude over to keep his wife company while he's gone for portions of the day

[18:38:54] <audrey> But this is similar to a conversation I was having yesterday, actually. I was remarking that most Americans these days would probably go bananas if they ever had to contend with Gorbachev-era shortages on goods.
[18:39:18] <biys> just awit till christmas
[18:39:20] <audrey> Case in point - the panicking over something as insignificant as toilet paper shortages. (Does nobody have creativity?)
[18:39:38] <audrey> I remember a time when we used to fill the bathtub up with water at night because we didn't know if there would be running water in the morning.
[18:39:56] <biys> well i grew up on spagetti and margarine
[18:40:13] <biys> when toast, margarine and sugar was considered a meal
[18:40:27] <audrey> I'm not saying this to be "tough love", simply that ... a certain degree of perspective appears to have been lost
[18:40:50] <biys> i had one pair of pants
[18:41:00] <audrey> And with the loss of that perspective, suddenly your Kindle not arriving for Christmas or the 2-ply toilet rolls no longer being in stock, becomes a crisis.
[18:41:55] <biys> i can't let my true ideas flow about this or i'd likely be banned
[18:42:00] <biys> so on that note i'mma go make some coffee

[18:43:20] *** Quits: NickMirage (~NickMirag@user/nickmirage) (Quit: -)

[18:43:41] <biys> expectations of what people _ought_ to have my default.  regardless of the positions they'ev put themselevs in

[18:44:44] <biys> there's no personal rsponsibility anymore
[18:44:49] <biys> it's all the governments fault
[18:44:51] <biys> or white people
[18:44:53] <biys> *shrug*
[18:45:17] <audrey> Meh, I'm not big on bans these days unless you do something that obviously contravenes the channel rules or the server's terms of use
[18:45:34] <audrey> Hell, I took a month long vacation from here :P
[18:45:40] <audrey> I think I get what you're trying to say though, yeah
[18:45:45] <biys> :s/ought to have my default/ought to have_by_ default/
[18:47:18] <biys> so part of this lit class i'm taking focuses on "whitewashing"
[18:47:30] <biys> and the effects of colonialism on other cultures, for example africa
[18:48:03] <biys> there's this lady who talks about e gentleman by the name of John Locke who went to Africa and documented for the purpose of showing people back in his home land how things are in Africa
[18:48:35] <audrey> You're studying in higher ed?
[18:48:41] <audrey> You have my sympathies. :[
[18:48:50] <audrey> I got the hell out of there when I was 21 and never looked back. Can't imagine what it's like today.
[18:49:58] <biys> so in 1670 or whenever it was that he wrote what he wrote about the African people
[18:50:02] <biys> it's being looked at TODAY
[18:50:10] <biys> and they're like "he's misrepresenting africa"
[18:50:44] <biys> so we go through this article as written in 1670
[18:50:52] <I_Am_M00t> hi biys
[18:50:55] <biys> and we're expected to pick out all the terrible things he says
[18:55:01] <audrey> biys: graduate or undergraduate?
[18:55:50] <audrey> If undergrad, I can sort of understand it as pandering to the demographic.
[18:56:00] <audrey> Graduate studies though ... well, you'd think that would be a little more serious, eh?
[18:58:16] <biys> audrey: it's just an attempt to better my writing skills, it's undergrad
[18:58:24] <biys> i regret the time/effort/money spent thus far
[18:58:36] <biys> so far it's just been preaching about the terrible white people and colonialism
[18:58:41] <biys> not anything to do with writing
[18:59:31] <audrey> Writing skills - professional writing, creative writing?
[18:59:32] <biys> the point where i cmopletely tuned out was when they said uh...
[18:59:48] <audrey> I got a helluva lot better at my writing by simply writing on my own.
[19:00:45] <biys> What is needed, according to Mano, are new media ethics as well as new methods for teaching and training journalists. Comparative approaches, critical theories and fact-checking could help correct the lies about Africa.
[19:01:02] <biys> apparently we need to train journalists to write the way we think they should write
[19:01:06] <audrey> Hmm, maybe what's needed is for the journalistic profession to die already

[22:33:13] <apotheon> "it depends"
[22:34:04] <tomathy> nay
[22:34:06] <apotheon> tomathy: What do you mean with the message about evil men storing up?
[22:34:27] *** Quits: arcturus (~arcturus@gateway/tor-sasl/arcturus) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[22:34:28] <apotheon> Your intent is not clear to me.
[22:34:50] <tomathy> evil deeds are done often out of anger because their phoney abstinence from evil hasnt been rewarded socialy
[22:35:29] <apotheon> I see.
[22:36:21] *** Joins: arcturus (~arcturus@gateway/tor-sasl/arcturus)
[22:36:44] <apotheon> You seem to be suggesting the idea of "evil" as human nature, and "good" as a desirable state that can only be reached after giving in to evil because without giving in one hasn't the perspective to understand good and evil.
[22:37:18] <tomathy> yes you put it well
[22:37:27] <apotheon> Those who seem "good" are only responding to positive and negative stimuli if they haven't experienced evil behavior in a way that teaches them the truth about good.
[22:38:00] <tomathy> but you dont have to give in to it, witnessing it is probably enough
[22:38:27] <tomathy> it's about the perspective you choose
[22:38:32] <apotheon> It's an interesting idea.  I'm not sure yet whether I believe that being "evil" in some sense is a prerequisite for being "good", but I'm not sure it isn't, either.
[22:38:44] <apotheon> ah
[22:38:57] <apotheon> Yes, witnessing it was one strong potential counterargument.
[22:39:05] <mnemon> apotheon: the "truth about good" is largely a result of reasoning.
[22:39:12] <tomathy> but a very high level of goodness comes from darth vader types who fell and come back to the light
[22:39:13] <apotheon> I was thinking about the fact that one can learn from the experiences of others.
[22:39:15] <mnemon> rather than experiencing evil behaviour
[22:40:26] <apotheon> mnemon: I think you mean to direct that to tomathy.
[22:40:40] <apotheon> mnemon: I was just paraphrasing what tomathy said, to ensure I understood correctly.
[22:40:50] <tomathy> i've never reasoned my way into a deed that i can think of anyway
[22:41:12] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[22:41:32] <tomathy> maybe reason has enhanced a deed
[22:42:10] <mnemon> apotheon: was in response to how you put it
[22:43:26] <mnemon> but meant that if you want to intentionally "be good" you generally have to understand the ethics of the situation, otherwise you're just copycatting or responsing to the reinforcement
[22:44:44] <apotheon> mnemon: of course
[22:44:55] *** Joins: SGautam (uid286066@id-286066.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[22:45:01] <apotheon> I think that was implicit in the original statement.
[22:46:02] <apotheon> I'm not 100% certain that such experience of evil (whether personally committed or observed) is necessary, though.  It's difficult to prove a negative.
[22:46:23] <mnemon> experience implies purely empirical approach and also possibly just a reaction to stimuli as you put it
[22:47:18] <apotheon> Experience might simply serve to illuminate the possibility of something, though -- so, if you never experience "evil", you may not be able to grasp the concept of good and evil.
[22:47:36] <apotheon> . . . by virtue of never having the idea fully made clear.
[22:48:23] <apotheon> Then again, there are so many banal evils inflicted every day that it shouldn't be difficult to find one.  The problem, then, becomes the question of whether you *noticed*.
[22:49:19] <mnemon> you can also merely observe although it might lead to different perception of the issues than being involved
[22:49:40] <apotheon> I do believe that "good" and "evil" don't really have any meaning if you do not make a choice -- at least a choice to do nothing when something could be done.
[22:49:54] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:50:20] <apotheon> Making a choice implies understanding something about the options.
[22:50:43] <tomathy> yes, how many cowards are sinless
[22:50:48] <mnemon> they're rather subjective labels in the first place
[22:51:09] <tomathy> because they are simply not brave enough to do the evil
[22:51:10] <apotheon> A rock thrown by a person has committed no act of good or evil; it was not the rock's choice.
[22:51:48] *** Quits: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[22:52:08] <apotheon> Even if the rock was somehow able to physically influence events, it would need motive to do so in any meaningful way.
[22:52:26] <apotheon> That motive would have to be predicated on some understanding of options.
[22:53:39] <apotheon> If that understanding does not extend to "good" or "evil" consequences, the act lacks qualities of ethical choice, so the rock (or the person for whom the rock is an allegory) has not acted in an ethically significant manner.
[22:54:07] <apotheon> Where does one get that understanding?  One could just absorb the ideas of others, but that is much the same as being thrown by another's hand.
[22:55:06] <apotheon> The understanding must, to some extent, involve intellectual involvement.  Thus, ethical reasoning is a prerequisite for ethical agency.

[22:56:42] <apotheon> On what must that ethical reasoning operate?  The question tomathy raises is whether one must have some personal involvement in acts of evil -- as a perpetrator or as an invested observer -- to fully apply ethical reasoning, I think.
[22:57:53] <apotheon> (and, yeah, I think watching the original Star Wars trilogy is an interesting example of how to get intellectual and/or emotional investment from an observer)

[23:10:15] <audrey> But still, I'm going to take some basic opsec precautions.
[23:10:37] <_candle_> Well perhaps some ops are hateful themselves and ate the ones who do the harassment

[23:11:05] <_candle_> Haha
[23:11:19] <_candle_> s/ate/are

[23:28:56] <_candle_> There
[23:29:26] <_candle_> But yeah that plato metals myth I hadnt heard of
[23:29:30] <biys> i think it's weird to assume that a person has to act in any way you think they should act

[23:30:59] *** Quits: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:31:58] <biys> what it sounds like you're subscribing to is some kind of universal preferebale behaviour
[23:32:25] <biys> you have preconceived notions about how you think peopel ought to act or be or respond or talk
[23:32:44] <biys> my typical response to something liek this is: "how does the air smell up there on your high horse?"
[23:33:23] <biys> it's almost as though you've decided the most appropriate way to live within time and space that transcends time and space
[23:33:36] <biys> this always seems interesting to me
[23:33:42] <biys> so please, if you will, elaborate
[23:33:47] <evolv> please, I ask of you
[23:33:54] <evolv> do not get your horses high. That is animal abuse
[23:34:09] <biys> what if the horse likes it?
[23:34:19] <tomathy>  thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn
[23:34:43] <evolv> do not facilitate someone else's heedlessness
[23:34:59] <evolv> and, of course, first time is always non-consensual
[23:35:27] <biys> more-so the presuppositions about the most appropriate way to live within the universe and their origins
[23:35:32] <biys> it sounds like Sam Harris TBH
[23:36:18] <_candle_> What is Sam Harris' veiw
[23:36:23] <biys> the example i always use is something like this
[23:36:37] <biys> if i grew up 8 mile detroit and you grew up beverly hills 90210 our ideas of the world would be signifiacntly different
[23:36:49] <biys> where i'd likely sag my pants and wear a backwards ball cap, you might wear khakis and a polo
[23:37:10] <biys> who, in this situation, has the most accurate understanding of the world?
[23:37:17] <biys> you because you're wearing khakis and a polo?
[23:37:51] <biys> i come from a long line of khaki wearers
[23:37:57] <biys> it's the most appropriate way to dress within the world
[23:38:33] <biys> Sam Harris believes that an admirable purpose is that of harm reduction
[23:38:42] <biys> as no one wants to feel/be harmed
[23:38:55] <biys> it is something like self evident that the reduction of harm is MOST ADMIRABLE
[23:39:45] <biys> at the end of the day harm is actually a fact of life
[23:39:52] <biys> harm happens all around us
[23:40:24] <_candle_> I like Sam Harris
[23:40:26] <biys> if we follow the idea to its natural conlcusion we'd likely have a very negative impact on the plant and the universe
[23:41:02] <tomathy> i talked to a plant today
[23:41:13] <tomathy> it said something along the lines of "hey, i am here you know"
[23:41:16] <biys> what did the plant tell you?
[23:41:31] <biys> that's pretty deep for a plant
[23:41:36] <_candle_> Water me?
[23:41:42] <tomathy> basically tried object focussed meditation and saw some sparkles
[23:41:56] <tomathy> after focussing on the plant
[23:42:09] <tomathy> i imagine that was the plant telling me it's there
[23:43:10] <biys> there's a very specific word for it that i can't for the life of me remember
[23:43:27] <biys> it's the idea that unelss a person speaks to me in a manner i find acceptable i shouldn't have to speak with them
[23:43:44] <biys> IMO it's weird to expect anyone to act in any particular manner or another
[23:43:47] <biys> _expect_
[23:43:56] <_candle_> I agree
[23:44:08] <tomathy> i expect to get violated
