[21:41:04] <dieggsy> oh no. well. I'm seeing your messages now, so hopefully it's ok going forward
[21:41:26] <dieggsy> maybe i should just go back to an IRC client

[23:15:07] <fantazo> the reason for the vandusen bot, is something I haven't yet fully understood. it simply prints spam a lot.
[23:16:59] <wasamasa> it announces new pastes
[23:17:04] <wasamasa> sometimes the new pastes are spam
[23:17:15] <wasamasa> so in that case, it announced they're spam and who submitted it
[23:17:34] <wasamasa> the spammer doesn't see any indication of the post not being successful
