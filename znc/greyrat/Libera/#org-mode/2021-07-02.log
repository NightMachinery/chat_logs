[18:17:26] <Tisoxin> I want to be able to represent such a table in org-mode
[18:17:50] <ngz> Ah, I see.
[18:17:52] <Tisoxin> One possibility would be to just represent this table as a nested list
[18:18:15] <ngz> True. I think the odt exporter implements this, but this has never been generalized.
[18:19:10] <Tisoxin> Well, for me it's not that important, that the exporter supports it, but i want to be able to edit such a table conveniently
[18:20:03] <ngz> These tables are not supported by Org. You may want to look into "table.el" package instead.
[18:20:07] <Tisoxin> Guess I have to write it myself…
[18:21:17] <Tisoxin> Hm, table.el doesn't seem to be the right fit for me
[18:21:47] <Tisoxin> Bc that doesn't really integrate with org-mode does it?
[18:22:05] <Tisoxin> And also, i don't want massive tables

[18:23:21] <ngz> There is some limited integration between table.el tables and Org.
[18:24:40] <Tisoxin> <Tisoxin "And also, i don't want massive t"> E.g.: I want to be able to view my files in a splitted window, which won't be the case, if my table has lots of text
[18:25:31] <ngz> But do you want to see it as a list, or as a table?
[18:26:07] <Tisoxin> i'm fine with a list
[18:26:59] <ngz> Since you're not interesting in export, at what time should it become a table?
[18:27:23] <ngz> interested*
[18:28:38] <Tisoxin> let me show you a example
[18:33:33] <Tisoxin> I want it to have the structure of a table, but written as a normal list: https://paste.debian.net/plain/1203148
[18:33:46] <Tisoxin> (That's the table from early)
[18:33:51] <Tisoxin> *earlier
[18:34:38] <ngz> I understand that. Any list can be turned into a table.
[18:35:10] <ngz> I mean "could be represented as a table".

[18:36:20] <ngz> But you said you were fine editing lists, so when do you want to see the corresponding table?
[18:36:39] <Tisoxin> But what i want is a package, which adds functionality for lists, where the sublist has always the same structure
[18:37:10] <Tisoxin> E.g. in the example the sublists of Monday and Tuesday had the same structure
[18:38:03] <Tisoxin> <ngz "But you said you were fine editi"> I don't really want to see them, it's just those “list tables” are what i want to represent extern tables with lots of text in org-mode
[18:38:28] <ngz> So, just write lists and enforce the structure you want :)
[18:38:44] <ngz> Problem solved ;)
[18:39:55] <Tisoxin> That's what I'm doing at the moment, but it's just that it's annoying having to copy the sublists, etc.

The author indicates you need to take action to update your configuration before Roam V2 is published. The author does provide actionable instructions that I have been able to find.

[20:38:19] <Demosthenex> SAAS :P my accountant has me use
[20:39:00] <shrysr> Demosthenex:loox interesting. not much info on the site though.
[20:39:20] <Demosthenex> each month for invoicing, i pull my agenda for different customers and type up a short table of hours and ticket numbers, but i have zero patience to use their GODDAMN webui to enter hours. so i just have in the past created an invoice with a single line for the hours, and mailed my contact the details
[20:40:19] <tyson2> Demosthenex: I figured out the problem with tag completion in org, I had just misunderstood the manual
[20:40:20] <Demosthenex> i'm hoping to shorten this down to a single function call per line

[20:40:53] <tyson2> thanks, and it also works with ivy (which just calls the normal completion routine)

[20:53:24] <ordoflammae> Hi y'all. I'm having an issue with org-capture not pasting things out of my clipboard. I looked into it, and it looks like it's using the PRIMARY clipboard rather than the CLIPBOARD clipboard. How can I change this?
[20:54:54] <Demosthenex> ordoflammae: that's an emacs setting.
[20:55:13] <Demosthenex> if you're on linux with xwindows, it's common to have to update your emacs config to your preferred clipboard
[20:56:15] <Demosthenex> so, if i have an org-table of dates, hours, and descriptions, what'd be the best way to run a function across those items?
[20:56:51] <ordoflammae> Use spreadsheet functions?
[20:56:53] <ordoflammae> Maybe?
[20:56:57] <ordoflammae> Not sure I understand the question.
[20:57:16] <ordoflammae> Are you looking for something like org-babel?
[20:58:41] <Demosthenex> yeah, i was considering whether i should use a src block, or just make a funciton to read the current line and call it manually
[20:59:07] <ordoflammae> Demosthenx: my emacs settings are correct, I think
[20:59:28] <ordoflammae> =select-enable-clipboard= is =t=, and =select-enable-primary= is =nil=
[21:00:21] <ordoflammae> Demosthenex: if you want the code in the same file as the table, you probably should use a src block, if you want the code to read it somewhere else, I guess you could write a script somewhere else.
[21:00:28] <ordoflammae> I think the src block is the recommended approach
[21:00:48] <Demosthenex> https://orgmode.org/org.html#Environment-of-a-Code-Block wow this shows running elisp with an input table
[21:00:52] <Demosthenex> that's exactly what i want
[21:02:29] <ordoflammae> Nice.
[21:02:41] <ordoflammae> Demosthenex: is there another setting I need to set?
[21:02:55] <Demosthenex> 	select-enable-clipboard nil ; fix the new copy behavior, i want clip + primary to be the same
[21:02:58] <Demosthenex> 	select-enable-primary t
[21:04:27] <ordoflammae> Demosthenex: I want to use =clipboard=, not =primary=
[21:04:38] <ordoflammae> =primary= is the one that's not getting set.
[21:04:40] <ordoflammae> I checked
[21:04:50] <ordoflammae> Since I'm not selecting the urls.
[21:05:05] <Demosthenex> and its a list of lists. awesome!
[21:05:17] <Demosthenex> i just pasted from my file ;]
[21:05:17] <ordoflammae> Yes, org-src blocks are crazy cool!
[21:05:22] <Demosthenex> the clipboard settings i have
[21:07:04] <ordoflammae> Yeah, still not working.
[21:07:13] <ordoflammae> I think Org is setting the clipboards independently
[21:08:34] <Demosthenex> actually.... you should check your source application is setting the clipboard the way you expect
[21:08:41] <Demosthenex> recent firefox's have really screwed up copy/paste
[21:09:39] <ordoflammae> It's qutebrowser, not firefox
[21:09:43] <Demosthenex> xsel -po ; xsel -so ; xsel -bo 
[21:09:45] <ordoflammae> One sec.
[21:09:48] <ordoflammae> Yeah, I checked them.
[21:09:55] <ordoflammae> That's how I know which clipboards are getting modified.
[21:09:59] <ordoflammae> And this is org-capture
[21:10:08] <ordoflammae> So I'm not using =C-y= or anything.
[21:10:20] <ordoflammae> =C-y= works just fine
[21:10:36] <Demosthenex> https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion
[21:10:39] <ordoflammae> But the %x operator in org-capture templates does not
[21:10:53] <Demosthenex> %x ? have you tried %c ?
[21:11:44] <Demosthenex> yeah, i just checke.d. i have a template where i paste the current clipboard surrounded by example quotes
[21:11:47] <Demosthenex> in a block
[21:11:51] <Demosthenex> and i use kill-ring 0
[21:12:03] <ordoflammae> Ah, %c works.
[21:12:11] <ordoflammae> Nice, thanks a lot
[21:12:18] <Demosthenex> https://dpaste.org/x0WJ
[21:12:21] <ordoflammae> The tutorial I was looking at used %x
[21:12:37] <ordoflammae> But they probably didn't realize that there were multiple clipboards involved.
[21:13:03] <ordoflammae> And the writer was selecting everything he copied.
