[01:57:13] <poorbot> Hi, quick question
[01:57:33] <poorbot> Seems like theming for Django sites are hard, if you use extends, you are only stuck with one theme unless you use a different html for each extend you use
[01:57:34] <poorbot> Right?

[02:25:00] <mattmcc> poorbot: Depends on what sort of theming you're looking for. The {% extends %} tag does let you use a variable, so you can switch out the base template dynamically.
[02:25:15] <mattmcc> Or your base template may be the same, and the theme is managed by a set of includes.
[02:25:23] <poorbot> Dynamically? How?
[02:25:33] <poorbot> Wait, how to use includes?

[06:29:58] <Batzy> somehow if i click a button to redirect to /login route it wont set a cookie
[06:30:07] <Batzy> but if i go directly to /login in my browser
[06:30:08] <Batzy> then it works
[06:30:09] <Batzy> nice django
[06:32:33] <Batzy> also only works if i called set_test_cookie
[06:32:41] <Batzy> imagine having any consistency
[06:33:23] <Batzy> can anyone help with this or what
[06:36:07] <FunkyBob> meh... you'll probably tell at me for being intentionally dense, again
[06:36:39] <Batzy> that's got a simple solution
[06:36:42] <Batzy> dont be intentionally dense
[06:36:53] <Batzy> no but you have to see this, it's the craziest thing

[06:37:34] <FunkyBob> yeah... somehow you confused "not assuming things about your system , because assuming is the antithesis of debugging" with "being intentionally dense"...
[06:37:47] <Batzy> no i didnt it
[06:37:52] <Batzy> im sorry, i want to be nice to you and everything
[06:37:59] <Batzy> but you definitely are intentionally dense sometimes
[06:39:51] <Batzy> https://bpa.st/W6JA so here it is
[06:39:57] <dodobrain> Batzy, fumky prolly guides you in a way so that you will understand things yourself instead of simply being spoonfed the answer to this specific problem
[06:40:03] <Batzy> dodobrain dont lie to me
[06:40:07] <dodobrain> so you will be able to solve other related problems by yourself in the future
[06:40:13] <Batzy> im not referring to his drawn out explanations either
[06:40:14] <Batzy> thats fine with me
[06:40:18] <dodobrain> Batzy, i dont need to. i know how FunkyBob operates
[06:40:19] <Batzy> anyways
[06:40:23] <Batzy> dodobrain ignored (for now)
[06:40:28] <dodobrain> wonderful
[06:40:42] <Batzy> so that /login route is invoke just by going to domain/login
[06:40:59] <Batzy> the SPA has a button that redirects there, and if i do the whole login thing, no cookie is set
[06:41:08] <Batzy> yet if i manually in my browser just navigation to domain/login
[06:41:20] <Batzy> that actually will set the cookie
[06:41:36] <FunkyBob> where is `auth` from?
[06:41:37] <Batzy> as ive noted in the files though, if i remove the set_test_cookie
[06:41:40] <Batzy> no cookie is set
[06:41:57] <Batzy> FunkyBob that is from a steam-auth lib
[06:42:10] <Batzy> it's working fine, it redirects to steam for login and everything and im able to claim a steam id
[06:42:24] *** Quits: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[06:42:28] <Batzy> im trying to store the steam id in a session
[06:42:29] <FunkyBob> ok, and why would a session cookie be set in that view?
[06:42:33] <FunkyBob> does it store something in the session?
[06:42:49] <Batzy> which view? the callback?
[06:42:56] <FunkyBob> no, login
[06:43:02] <Batzy> it wouldnt
[06:43:10] <Batzy> there's no need to set anything there
[06:44:17] <FunkyBob> ok. you have some comments / code in there about not setting a cookie if you don't do the test
[06:45:08] <FunkyBob> so you feel the problem is in login_callback ?  you want to save the token in the session, and it's not working?
[06:45:12] <Batzy> FunkyBob i also just tested with moving the set_test_cookie to the callback instead of the login
[06:45:13] <Batzy> it doesnt work
[06:45:53] <Batzy> i guess it could be login callback
[06:46:34] <FunkyBob> am guessing your explicitly setting request.session.modified is there from tryting to force things?
[06:46:40] <Batzy> yep

[06:47:44] <Batzy> the only thingi think i could try is reworking my nginx conf
[06:47:50] <Batzy> but that shouldnt have anything to do with it
[06:47:54] <FunkyBob> in t he response headers do you see t he set-cookie header?
[06:48:48] <Batzy> i cant see the response in devtools for the callback
[06:48:49] <Batzy> for some reason
[06:49:39] <FunkyBob> is it the user return path? or is it a webhook?
[06:49:46] <Batzy> does it matter my browser says the request is localhost:8000/callback, but im working on 0.0.0.0 in my browser?
[06:49:53] <FunkyBob> also, that redirect is sus
[06:50:10] <Batzy> it is, but i didnt know how else to pass it off to the SPA
[06:50:41] <FunkyBob> if that's django.shortcuts.redirect ... then redirect('/') would suffice
[06:51:22] <Batzy> ok ill try it
[06:51:57] <Batzy> that doesnt work FunkyBob
[06:52:03] <Batzy> it tries to redirect to localhost:8000
[06:52:13] <Batzy> SPA is on 0.0.0.0 as per nginx
[06:53:09] <FunkyBob> 0.0.0.0 isn't a real address
[06:53:21] <FunkyBob> it's the placeholder you pass to the OS to say "bind to all interfaces"

[06:54:08] <Batzy> localhost:8000 is definitely

[06:56:19] <Batzy> i just have absolute 0 idea
[06:56:27] <Batzy> what is going on with this cookie stuff
[06:56:49] <Batzy> why does setting a  test cookie in a certain place completely change behavior

[09:32:45] <bparker> rannnn8888: Batzy: use a property on the model that formats the date the way you want
[09:33:29] <rannnn8888> bparker what u mean ?
[09:33:33] <bparker> if you're grabbing the queryset data from a template then you can reference that property instead to get a transformed value
[09:33:54] <bparker> not sure how you're passing your data though
[09:34:43] <rannnn8888> bparker i get the data from the ajax
[09:35:10] <rannnn8888> bparker i dont can change in the template maybe from js but it more complicet
[09:35:22] <bparker> then wherever this ajax response is built from, you can reference the property there
[09:35:54] <bparker> without seeing the code it's hard to guess what all might be needed
[09:37:48] <rannnn8888> bparker https://dpaste.org/wAPd
[09:38:29] <bparker> I meant the view this ajax request uses
[09:38:51] <bparker> how is that dict built
[09:39:14] <bparker> a serializer on the queryset or something ?
[09:39:40] <rannnn8888> bparker never mind i fint fix this in js
[09:39:41] <bparker> if so you could probably implement a custom encoder to use an alternate property for the date

[15:32:46] <FunkyBob> sure, have an unique uuid field, but not as pk
[15:33:04] <mihael> FunkyBob what should I use as a pk? an incrementing value instead?

[15:45:17] <FunkyBob> when you do not specify a field as primary-key, django automatically adds one - called 'id'
[15:47:27] <mihael> Can you point me to a documentation or an article where they use both primary key and uuid? I'm assuming they use uuid for urls and the primary key internally
[15:47:54] <FunkyBob> add the uuid field like you had, set it as unique

[16:10:34] <mihael> FunkyBob I think it's more of me not understanding it, haha
[16:11:23] <mihael> I'm adding a non-nullable field 'id' to athleteprofile without a default. I'm not sure what this mean
[16:12:06] <FunkyBob> you added a new field. it's not nullable. it doesn't have a default. so what value should it be set ti?
[16:12:14] <FunkyBob> since the rules of the DBMS require it to have a value
[16:12:38] <mihael> this refers to the user field right?
[16:14:02] <mihael> Hmm, it works if I add the `primary_key=True` option
[16:14:38] <FunkyBob> it refers to the 'id' field... hence the text " a non-nullable field 'id' "
[16:14:40] *** Quits: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[16:15:15] <mihael> FunkyBob I thought django would implicitly create/define one if I don't
[16:17:48] <FunkyBob> it did
[16:17:52] <FunkyBob> that's why you have the error
[16:17:59] <FunkyBob> because there's no values for it
[16:18:05] <FunkyBob> and the DB won't let you create it
[16:18:19] <FunkyBob> because it's marked as unique... and not nullable... and you've got no values for it
[16:20:05] <FunkyBob> your best solution would be to add explcitly an ID field, then do a migration to set values... then switch it to the default

[16:22:09] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: for example if the user wants to change background color
[16:22:14] <FunkyBob> yes, and?
[16:22:16] <wallbroken> or number of column
[16:22:17] <FunkyBob> where's the question?
[16:22:31] <wallbroken> the question is: could you tell me te steps to do that?
[16:22:36] <wallbroken> obviously not the code
[16:22:40] <wallbroken> i'll do it by myself
[16:22:43] <wallbroken> just the steps
[16:22:46] <FunkyBob> you know the steps to do it
[16:22:55] <wallbroken> prepare an update view
[16:22:59] <wallbroken> this is the first step
[16:23:00] <wallbroken> right?
[16:23:04] <wallbroken> prepare a form
[16:23:08] <wallbroken> and prepare a model
[16:23:10] <wallbroken> right?
[16:23:12] <FunkyBob> see?
[16:23:37] <wallbroken> the second stage is to pull the current settings on loading the page
[16:24:21] <wallbroken> you don't see anything?

[16:25:43] *** Joins: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei)
[16:28:54] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: the update view is not for getting the current state of fields
[16:29:06] <wallbroken> so you want to do that
[16:29:41] <wallbroken> the update view simply sends a new value of the fields to the server

[21:13:39] <theseb> what are recommended uwsgi settings?  i'm trying to deal w/ cpu and memory spikes and don't understand all the settings
[21:15:33] <GinFuyou> You can check basics here https://blog.tinbrain.net/tutorials/simple-django-deploy.html#configuring-uwsgi or try uwsgi channel (not sue if it moved to libera too)

[21:17:58] <wallbroken> GinFuyou: what is the best way to check if the current logged user isn't in an m2m field?
[21:18:13] <wallbroken> i want to check if the current user has the item ordered
[21:20:23] <rannnn8888> Hey i have page i want make watchlist to each user this the modles.py https://dpaste.org/0QkO
[21:20:24] <rannnn8888> this myadmin https://dpaste.org/xqpF now the users can see only the own watchlist but how i can limit the user can add data only for own list ?
[21:21:01] <bparker> wallbroken: m2m fields are completely the wrong way to track orders, I already mentioned this multiple times. your models are *highly* flawed
[21:21:24] <theseb> GinFuyou: thanks...if i can ask another quest...would you agree bad settings can lead to freezing your machine?  i was kinda surprised this problem forced itself upon me..wondering if i was only one

[21:25:38] <GinFuyou> theseb, nope, I didn't have problems with uwsgi iirc, but indeed it has a ton of settings and I guess something could be off
[21:26:53] <GinFuyou> bancroft, why you have POST in detail view?
[21:27:07] <bparker> wallbroken: you're describing an "XY problem"... you're looking for the wrong solution because you have a much bigger problem.
[21:27:27] <bparker> whoever gave you that solution is also wrong
[21:27:28] <bancroft> GinFuyou: for when an auth user wanted to make a change to a detail
[21:27:32] <wallbroken> yes but that's not the point of my problem
[21:27:36] <bparker> yes it is
[21:27:48] <bparker> you're just ignoring the issue
[21:28:17] <bparker> you need to step back and fix your schema first

[21:29:47] <theseb> GinFuyou: uwsgi has all kinds of ceilings you can set like --max-requests and --harakiri ...I think they basically restart processes...It feels almost like instead of you rebooting the server you are setting uwsgi to redo things for you automatically
[21:30:23] <theseb> GinFuyou: My point is a "good" config seems to mean auto-rebooting in a sense
[21:30:49] <GinFuyou> theseb, yes I think it's generally recommended for wsgi servers to restart workers after some time (requests)
[21:31:53] <theseb> GinFuyou: well then crap that should be a default...otherwise django has a bunch of newbs like me wondering why their new server keeps freezing

[23:18:08] <knbk_> I_am_6r1d: database connections in Django are per thread, so things like transactions and serverside cursors only work with thread_sensitive=True if the transaction/cursor passes an sync <-> async boundary. Setting it to True is always safe, but there's an overhead in all the bookkeeping it has to perform. thread_sensitive=False has less overhead, and *may* be safe, but that entirely depends on what you do
