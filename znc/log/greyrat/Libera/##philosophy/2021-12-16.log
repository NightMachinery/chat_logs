[03:14:16] <causative> true, human reasoning can be modeled like this.  We have first a set of all possible propositions, and at any point in time, a mind assigns a value to each proposition - possible values may be {true, false, indeterminate} or may be a larger set, e.g. fuzzy logic
[03:15:37] <causative> the mind has a reasoning rule.  The reasoning rule works like this.  Given any subset of propositions that the mind might consider in short-term memory at once at a particular time, the reasoning rule says how the values of these propositions will update, based on the previous values.
[03:16:46] <causative> for example, "modus ponens" can be framed like so:  given propositions A(true), A->B(true), and C(true or indeterminate), we update to form A(true), A->B(true), and C(true).
[03:17:17] <causative> actual human reasoning is not purely deductive, and the framework I have just presented allows for all sorts of non-deductive reasoning
[03:17:19] *** Joins: MavropaliasG (~alpha@122-151-126-148.sta.dodo.net.au)
[03:17:59] <causative> for example, the propositions considered in short-term memory could be facts of a criminal case together with the appropriate verdict, initially undetermined, and the reasoning rule updates to give the verdict
[03:18:15] <causative> this is not deduction - the verdict may change with more information
[03:18:45] <causative> it allows for empirical heuristics, inductive reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, whatever you like
[03:20:43] <goli> let's take it easy now
[03:20:53] <causative> conclusions of the mind's reasoning rule are not "final":  more information may change them.  But some mental states - some assignments of values to all propositions - may be "stable," in the sense that it is not possible to use the reasoning rule (RR) to change them any further
[03:21:27] <Delf> Then you'll be labeled stubborn
[03:21:30] <goli> so where are we getting to, are you proposing something?
[03:22:06] <causative> from a given mental state S, we might be interested in the "reachable neighborhood" of S;  this is the set of all propositions that can be reached from S by any sequence of applications of the RR

[03:22:31] <causative> sorry, the reachable neighborhood is the set of all *mental states* that can be reached from S by any sequence of applications of the RR

[03:23:43] *** Joins: yanmaani (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani)
[03:28:06] <causative> we are also interested in "attractor" mental states.  Informally, S is an attractor mental state if, given that we are initially near S, we can be persuaded arbitrarily close to S, and can't be persuaded away from S
[03:29:20] <causative> formally, to express this concept, we need to add a notion of "closeness" of mental states.  We do this by making S a topological space and defining open sets on it.

[03:37:33] <causative> unpacking that a little, we're saying that if we initially think S' (and S' is "close enough" to S), then we can be persuaded of a mental state S'', such that from S'' we can never be persuaded too far from S.  We're moving from a mental state S' that's a little farther from S, to a mental state S'' that is inescapably closer to S.
[03:39:27] <causative> attractor mental states, I would argue, are a concept of truth - truth is what we can be persuaded of (or persuaded arbitrarily close to)
[03:41:12] <causative> when I say "persuasion" here, I am implicitly talking about a sequence of applications of the RR

[04:01:45] <causative> I've actually come at it a little bit backwards by beginning with propositions and values - really we should begin with the set of mental states, and with the RR that says how mental states may proceed to other mental states, and the value of each proposition is an *arbitrary function* of the mental states
[04:02:51] <causative> it's better to do it that way (forwards) because it allows there to be more to a mental state than just the propositions
[04:03:46] <causative> and because it allows us to account for arbitrary differences in the mind's changing definitions of terms

[13:54:16] <brigand> Although commonly used as a dietary supplement and studied in laboratory models of human diseases,[10] there is no high-quality evidence that resveratrol improves lifespan or has a substantial effect on any human disease.[11][12][13]
[13:54:56] <brigand> The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters  to several manufacturers advertising on their product labels and  websites that quercetin product(s) can be used to treat diseases.[36][37] The FDA regards such quercetin advertising and products as unapproved – with unauthorized health claims  concerning the anti-disease products – as defined by "sections  201(g)(1)(B) and/or 201 (g)(1)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C.

[16:26:57] <chomwitt> in greece and in europe there is a push to pass an agenda of evaluation to help 'quality'
[16:27:22] <T3ddy> what is evaluation?
[16:27:43] <chomwitt> so i search the EU related documents .. https://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/school/quality-assurance_en

[16:31:29] <chomwitt> so ... i tried to remember that quote that plankster found.
[16:33:40] <chomwitt> so.. i wonder in philosophical manner... what do EU wants for its education? How can you have 'quality' with non-dignified teachers acting as pigs for dollars?
[16:35:28] <chomwitt> in a sense then you could make the best 'quality' schools but have teachers with no dignity.
[16:36:12] <chomwitt> But that creates another conudrum,,,
[16:36:19] <chomwitt> conundrum
[16:37:06] <chomwitt> Can a teacher with no dignity foster a students dignity?
[16:37:59] <chomwitt> So.. can we make a logical jump and say EU doesnt seem to care if its future citizens have dignity or not.

[16:38:33] <arryana> i don't really see how one ill-advised publicity stunt should be extrapolated that far
[16:39:50] <chomwitt> arryana, sorry its not a pr stunt. it's an pushed if not enforced policy
[16:40:19] <chomwitt> in greece is a much highly debated issue in public edu sector

[16:40:39] <ro-bot-o> [url] Welcome to Eurydice | Eurydice | eacea.ec.europa.eu
[16:41:06] <arryana> you're using 'dignity' in a very loose manner
[16:41:47] <arryana> and those 'dash for cash' things are -meant- as publicity stunts to raise awareness for funding
[16:42:01] <arryana> it's a stupid idea, but a lot of ideas are stupid.
[16:42:16] <arryana> that doesn't make everyone who is willing to participate for a good cause to have 'no dignity'
[16:44:31] <chomwitt> Video footage of the event went viral on social media, and was described as being dehumanizing towards teachers[1] as well as "dystopian" and "humiliating", drawing comparisons to scenes from The Hunger Games or Squid Game.
[16:44:57] <chomwitt> i tend to agree with that wikipedia 'quote'
[16:46:03] <chomwitt> a personal act can be stupid
[16:46:24] <chomwitt> but a public ''stupid'' act is open to criticism
[16:46:36] <arryana> if nobody gets shot at the end, it's a rather hyperbolic comparison
[16:48:41] <chomwitt> the issue here what do we consider normal arryana
[16:48:52] <arryana> that's subjective.
[16:49:05] <pussipupu> Hunger Games is a terrible book(or I wasn't a teenager when I read it) and searching for a term in a document and getting no results doesn't mmean thte subect of that term aren't considered in the document
[16:49:10] <arryana> and i don't personally see how hyperbolic comparisons are helpful
[16:49:15] <chomwitt> and what acts lower our standards regarding what acts are socially acceptable
[16:49:33] * arryana shrugs
[16:49:36] <pussipupu> Squid Game was pretty good though
[16:49:42] <arryana> i liked squid game
[16:49:53] <chomwitt> pussipupu, wittgenstein would probably thougth otherwise..
[16:49:57] <arryana> and as to 'lowering one's standards' is also subjective
[16:49:58] <chomwitt> :)
[16:50:19] <pussipupu> I'm almost certain he wouldn't've
[16:50:22] <chomwitt> squid game should be banned

[16:50:50] <chomwitt> arryana, let me collate on that argument,,
[16:50:59] <arryana> why should it be banned?
[16:51:04] <pussipupu> Needing it is a sign of a malfunctioning state to be fair, and in a way that diminishes dignity
[16:51:13] <chomwitt> arryana, do mud wrestlers teach our kids?
[16:51:39] <arryana> i'm positive you could find teachers who mud wrestle for a good cause if you googled enough
[16:51:48] <arryana> i've seen firefighters dress in drag and dance

[16:55:39] <arryana> learning to be a waitress, people will often behave in ways toward a 'servant' that they wouldn't toward someone else.
[16:56:10] <chomwitt> arryana, i found it. Wrestling in mud is fun .. but you missed a detail
[16:56:22] <arryana> but nobody is demeaned by being treated poorly by an idiot.  nobody's 'dignity' is diminished by doing honest work.  those things are solely from a person's integrity.
[16:56:32] <chomwitt> the got on their knees grabbing dollars.
[16:56:38] <arryana> a person can be a servant, yet nobody's bitch.
[16:57:16] <arryana> i didn't 'miss a detail', you didn't state that information in your original assertion.
[16:57:39] <arryana> and it doesn't change my mind that it was a stupid publicity stunt, but has nothing to do with a person's 'dignity'
[16:58:51] <arryana> and i wasn't aware they used dollars in the eu.
[16:59:06] <chomwitt> i would want to see my teacher on his knees grabbing euros. Books sure , but money not
[16:59:20] <chomwitt> arryana, a
[17:00:25] <chomwitt> arryana, i addressed that argument. public stunts are public.. seen by many people .. so have implication for what we perceive as socially accepted
[17:00:43] <chomwitt> and that happeded.
[17:00:47] <chomwitt> happened
[17:00:54] <arryana> i disagree.  all sorts of things are attempted.  and people accept or reject whatever they personally feel is morally appropriate
[17:01:04] <chomwitt> After a widespread negative response to the event, CU Mortgage Direct and the Sioux Falls Stampede released a joint apology. The two groups stated that they had intended to create a "positive and fun experience" for the teachers involved, but that they understood why the event was seen as "degrading and insulting towards the participating teachers and the teaching profession as a whole.
[17:01:21] <arryana> the argument that all people are sheep and can't assess the validity of what they see is insulting to the general public, and not particularly accurate.
[17:01:25] <chomwitt> so they apologized
[17:01:33] <chomwitt> :)
[17:01:38] <arryana> right.  because as i said in the first place, it was stupid.
[17:01:52] <pussipupu> I don't get why you're conflating an event in the US to a grep on an EU document to be honest
[17:01:55] <chomwitt> sorry have to go for a while. happy discussing!!
[17:02:05] <arryana> just because something attempted turned out to be misguided doesn't mean it's suddenly a slippery slope for the universe.
[17:02:15] <arryana> yeah, this isn't making much sense to me
[17:02:24] <arryana> and it's getting repetitive
[17:02:38] <arryana> i'd have been more curious to find out why this person would ban squid game
[17:02:53] <pussipupu> Personally I*m glad there was at least outcry
[17:03:22] <arryana> it makes my point that people will use the voice of reason, and not just be sheep easily corrupted to poor ideas
[17:05:10] <pussipupu> Dunno, I do find it troubling that it happened in the first place
[17:05:23] <pussipupu> But I'm suspicious by default of power gradients
[17:06:50] <pussipupu> I'd  be an anarchist if I could figure out how :þ
[17:07:07] <arryana> haha
[17:07:17] <arryana> i agree that it was a misguided and idiotic concept
[17:07:40] <arryana> but i don't think it compares to dystopian examples like hunger or squid games
[17:08:12] <pussipupu> I think it exists on the same spectrum
[17:08:17] <pussipupu> But I still want to know why we should ban Squid Game

[17:34:01] <pussipupu> So you think children shouldn't have access to satire?

[17:34:22] <chomwitt> satire? are you kidding?
[17:34:33] <pussipupu> You could make a case that it's too violent to show to young children, certainly

[17:36:14] <chomwitt> pussipupu, my argument is two fold 1) big exposure to antisocial and dehumanizing 'culture' 2) less exposure to social humanizing exposure

[17:37:04] <pussipupu> chomwitt: You realise that Squid Game is satire and critique of (amongst other things) the massive power differentials in modern capitalism
[17:37:06] <pussipupu> ?
[17:37:19] <arryana> that's the responsibility of parents.  and squid game is on netflix.
[17:37:24] <arryana> which has parental controls
[17:37:45] <arryana> i also don't see how squid game is any different to anything else adult kids shouldn't watch
[17:37:57] <chomwitt> ha!! do you realise that the sell point that attracted young viewers is not the 'satire' ?
[17:37:58] <arryana> 'think of the children' is often used as an excuse.
[17:38:27] <arryana> by that argument no media should be anything other than educational or g rated.
[17:39:01] * arryana giggles
[17:39:09] <chomwitt> in a balanced world i propably woulnt mind squiq game.
[17:39:11] <arryana> i was maybe seven or eight the first time i saw 'the deer hunter'
[17:39:16] <arryana> and i learned a lot.
[17:40:08] <arryana> i can't agree with that thinking.  it seems to assert that nanny state thinking is more important than personal accountability
[17:40:31] <chomwitt> pussipupu, when you wrap your satire in a dehumanizing medium then perhaps medium is the message..
[17:40:59] *** Joins: saufa (~saufa@m91-129-101-167.cust.tele2.ee)
[17:41:28] <chomwitt> that is what most will get as message and voila we come back to the 'dash for cash.
[17:42:19] <chomwitt> meaning when the medium is dehumanizing and we accepted it then our barrier gets lowered
[17:42:42] <chomwitt> (espessialy if we talk about kids)
[17:44:24] <arryana> sorry, can't agree with almost all of what you're saying.  you keep making leaps that aren't a given and extrapolating things that aren't related.
[17:44:59] <chomwitt> so netflix is getting money by lowering our barriers constantly of what is socially unacceptable. Because that sells. especially to young audiences
[17:45:48] <chomwitt> arryana, there is a line between 'dash for cash' and 'squid games' that is disturbing . dont you see?
[17:46:02] <arryana> no.  i think you're conflating.
[17:46:04] <chomwitt> i mean a connecting cultural line
[17:46:28] <audrey> I mean, I am of the opinion that most shows today are pretty garbage
[17:46:34] <audrey> not really sure where this argument is headed though
[17:46:50] <arryana> don't look at me.  i found it repetitive and pointless some time ago
[17:47:07] <audrey> kids ideally should not be consuming mass media on a regular basis until a certain age anyway
[17:47:14] <chomwitt> me conflating you turning a blind eye.
[17:47:46] <audrey> it´s rather sad to me when I see parents who place iPads in the hands of their three-year-old because it pacifies the kid and they can´t be bothered to give the kid proper attention for whatever reason
[17:47:49] <arryana> i'm not turning a blind eye.  i just don't agree with you.
[17:48:06] <audrey> I´m really glad not to be growing up today, TBH.
[17:48:10] <arryana> i couldn't agree more, audrey
[17:48:24] <audrey> But maybe this is a digression from whatever you were talking about (waiting for my morning jolt of coffee to warm up).
[17:48:24] <arryana> saying that, when i was a kid, my brothers and i were limited to a half an hour of tv a week
[17:48:25] <arryana> each
[17:48:35] <arryana> and that did -not- mean we could watch each other's shows
[17:48:46] <arryana> my parents had that shit right.
[17:48:55] <arryana> but it doesn't mean i hate media, or think censorship is the answer.
[17:49:03] <chomwitt> audrey, as i said .. my main point is: do kids are exposed in messages and culture trends in a balanced manner or there is chaos were the disruption sells madly
[17:49:38] <arryana> i was not damaged by watching violent things, while our time was limited, our content was not
[17:50:04] <arryana> and anything that was not g rated, one of our parents would watch with us, and explain it
[17:50:12] <chomwitt> balance, is not censorship
[17:50:49] <arryana> so when you raise your own kids, put on attenborough documentaries until they're 21
[17:50:56] <arryana> that's your choice.
[17:50:57] <chomwitt> and filtering of exposure to psychopathologies is protection not censorshop

[17:51:36] <audrey> Childhood seems so unnatural these days. You´re sequestered into little rooms with your own TV, you aren´t allowed to play outside, your idea of «hanging out with friends» is gathering in the same room and communicating via text message and TikTok memes.
[17:51:53] <arryana> yeah, that's going to have social repercussions
[17:52:15] <chomwitt> arryana, i dont want to decide. I point to finger to imbalances.
[17:52:26] <chomwitt> point my finger
[17:52:44] <arryana> i was having a discussion with a friend on a similar aspect of it, which was that pre-85 or so, kids were expected to attend a certain number of events which required social competence, or the opportunity to learn it
[17:52:59] <audrey> Also, little kids getting exposed to gore and violent pornography from like 6 years old. Billie Eilish spoke out about this recently. Brave young woman - she has to know what kind of pushback this is going to get from mass media.
[17:53:03] <arryana> you can stop highlighting me.  i do not agree with you and no matter how many times you assert your opinion, mine will not agree
[17:53:23] <audrey> No wonder you see teenagers with PTSD and body image disorders on such a regular basis. :|

[19:38:59] <audrey> biys: I´ve long thought it was curious why the popular perception of that poem is that it´s about «taking the road less traveled by» and being independent. Because it´s really not about that. It´s about regret.
[19:39:20] <audrey> And the older I get (and consequently, the more regrets I collect in life), the more I understand the narrator.
[19:39:23] <biys> totally it's about regret

[19:55:20] <arryana> true enough
[19:55:26] <arryana> i think they're a necessary state, to some extent
[19:55:53] <arryana> i consider myself incredibly lucky that i only have one real regret.

[20:26:49] <JustLandedOnMars> so if evolution is all about survival of the fittest why aren't all rabbits superfast and why wolfs are not dying from starvation ?
[20:27:39] * arryana doesn't know where to begin in explaining how many ways that statement is pointless
[20:27:59] <arryana> i suggest you get a better understanding of evolution

[20:41:02] <biys> evolution is more-so just kind of like... tiny accidents
[20:41:09] <biys> and some of those accidents prove to be beneficial
[20:41:12] <biys> and some prove to not be
[20:41:38] <biys> when they prove to be beneficial might not show itself for any period in time, but could become beneficial eventually
[20:42:52] <ldlework> It takes energy to be fast, and energy is scarce. Rabbits are just fast enough to survive often enough, while not starving to metabolic demands.
