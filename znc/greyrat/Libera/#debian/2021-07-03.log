[08:37:53] <willow> is there another way for the shell to set a window title other than PS1 variable?
[08:40:12] <willow> i have konsole tabs set to use "window title set by shell" which works nicely for Vim with the "set title" option.  But for non-Vim sessions the title appears to be set to the value of PS1 which is annoying.
[08:40:43] <willow> so is it possible to change the value that the shell sets for the title without messing with PS1?

[14:20:43] <quadrat> !wwbr
[14:20:43] <dpkg> Now Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready." Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is July 31st 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. Stuff may slip but July 31 is hoped for.

[15:00:30] <ratrace> one would assume there's backups for all the data in that /home. in which case I'd just rebuild from scratch from a live env. personally I'd go with btrfs or zfs which is a pooled fs, but in this case, I'd recommend LVM, to future-proof it, and I don't usually recommend LVM

[15:02:06] <quadrat> You can remove those, but you still need way more diskspace than what they give back

[15:12:15] <quadrat> Nah I still snapshot, so I don’t want to snapshot everything. But still have issues with my “dream” setup, as when I create a subvolume for /var if I remember correctly I had issues with booting
[15:12:35] <ratrace> quadrat: persistent journald?
[15:13:24] <ratrace> I use snapshots too, daily ones, but then rsync to zfs backup. I guess I'm not bothering with subvoles because I have control over what I rsync back in case of recovery

[15:14:19] <ratrace> much.... much less hassle to --exclude than to fiddle with subvol snapshots. too bad btrfs doesn't have recursive snaps like zfs.
[15:14:25] <quadrat> Yes persistent journald, so you still only rsync the diff if I understand it correctly?
[15:14:35] <ratrace> quadrat: correct.
[15:15:13] <ratrace> I make snapshots then I rsync from teh snapshot, so that rsync is still atomic and can do it in peace, high `nice`, in the background
[15:15:22] <quadrat> Ahh good to know, so now I can improve my backup strat. I thought going from btrfs -> zfs or the other way around wouldn’t let me to just diff the difference
[15:16:18] <ratrace> as far as rsync is concerned and its delta mechanism, the filesystem doens't matter as long as it lists timestamps and sizes, or you can use --checksum, which I do from time to time to verify the files are the same between backup and production snapshots
[15:16:56] <ratrace> so the process is   btrfs snapshot -> rsync to zfs -> zfs snapshot equivalent. that way I have two "frozen" snaps, on different FS, to compare and verify against.   3-2-1 backups at their best.

[15:19:18] <hassoon> <3 kde
[15:19:21] <ratrace> but on the servers I also have a bit of a different backup regime for most of that data, it's live replication to backup, so rsync is just minor part of that
[15:20:04] <ratrace> otherwise I'd do  btrfs -> btrfs  snapshot _send_ and then weekly 3rd copy (in 3-2-1) to a zfs on another machine, because rsyncing all that takes most of the day
[15:20:22] <quadrat> ratrace so you also keep snapshots on the disk you backed up? any issues with how many you got on the disk, because I heard there were some issues when having a lot of snapshots

[18:17:02] <ede> the easiest method to implement such a generic choice i can imagine.

[18:20:09] <randall> ede: I agree its a bug. I'm just saying that it's not that common for people to configure their browser to use e.g. German as preferred language, but then want english instead. Which is why the www team might not know of that bug yet.

[18:21:41] <NthDegree> the correct behaviour is to list the languages in Accept-Language and let people pick one from what they've added

[18:22:08] <ede> FLAGS!
[18:22:20] <ratrace> NthDegree: no, the correct behaviour is to allow the user to select any language from the list that the site supports, regardless of Accept-Language header.
[18:22:45] <ratrace> Accept-Language header may be used on first visit, when the language is not set by that browser for that site (eg, cookies)
[18:22:53] <ede> just like GBU uses at least for the menu (it took me some time to notice what it is, looks a bit odd)
[18:23:05] <NthDegree> as per the standard: "The Accept-Language request HTTP header advertises which languages the client is able to understand, and which locale variant is preferred. "
[18:23:10] <ede> or just like wikipedia, use the language using proper glyphs
[18:23:21] <NthDegree> why display languages you've declared you don't understand?
[18:23:30] <ratrace> the "standard" was written by someone who never had to develop a multilingual site in any number of regular use case scenarios.
[18:23:41] <ede> NthDegree: i may even want to check something in a language i usually don't use because i'm too bad at it

[18:26:07] <ede> it changed a lot since 3.0 ....
[18:26:09] <NthDegree> and there's another option: picking what the website natively uses
[18:26:15] <NthDegree> for that, you send just * or send nothing
[18:26:27] <ratrace> NthDegree: and instead of all that wasted effort.... sites offer languages they support, in a nicely javascripts animated menu. those sites win, debian.org and others who rely on strict "by the RESTful books!!!!" numbers, suck and will be avoided.

[18:28:38] <NthDegree> the reason browsers no longer do what ratrace is describing is because most people prefer the AI/ML-driven translation options instead
[18:29:17] <ratrace> [citation needed]   for "most people"
[18:29:40] <ratrace> I can tell you from 10+ years of professional experience building multilingual OLTS enterprise web applications, and customer facing websites:   they don't.
[18:30:00] <ratrace> primarily because among all the said AI/ML driven translations, the best of them sucks hairy donkey tails.
[18:31:00] <ratrace> they prefer: geocoded default, an easy to use clickable selection, no friggin cookie law confirmation screen, and the site to remember them when they come back, greeting them in their language.
[18:31:01] <ede> Edit > Settings > scroll down > [alternative languages] > open list > "search for languages > ... wait... > open list > select language > [Add] > wait > [OK]]
[18:31:13] <ede> that's how to add another language to firefox...
[18:31:34] <ratrace> so geocoded wins even over accept-language header.  RESTful spec writers who never actually used their specs, can remain closed behind the thick curtains of smoke filled academia roomlets where they belong.

[18:34:06] <ratrace> ede: the other day I wasted two hours figuring out a client support ticket that said they cannot change the language no matter what. I went through code up and down and then it dawned on me they've probably accidentally clicked "Translate to <whatever>" in the popup that chromium shows
[18:34:35] <ratrace> so "browser convenience tools" and the accept headerr, can go burn in binary hell. 
[18:34:52] <ratrace> (which is ternary, the third bit is sqrt(-1))
[18:34:54] <ede> also, geocode doesn't always work. think of belgium, switzerland, or just germans living in alsace. and what about sorbs?
[18:35:10] <ratrace> "what sorbs" she asked, sarcastically and cynically
[18:35:36] <ede> the header works most of the time, at least for me. but sometimes i just want something different than the default for different reasons.
[18:35:47] <ratrace> ede: geocode works even for those countries. advanced sites would pop up a tri-lingual choice menu before continuing. or default to german. :)

[18:44:12] <ede> wait, you lose your bookmakrs when leaving ESR behind?
[18:44:46] <ratrace> yes, non-ESR firefox refuses to reuse the ESR profile. everything is "lost". passwords, history, bookmarks, extensions, config...

[19:13:29] <ratrace> there's several tools for that
[19:13:35] <amacater> Someone was asking about FDE [full disk encryption] yesterday on ?? debian-boot. LUKS + encrypted LVM is the answer in Debian. It does mean, for example, that swap also has to be encrypted: so you might want to check you've enough swap for hibernation. It does mean that you probably need to check firmware requirements FIRST - there's nothing like typing onto a black screen without being able to see anything.
[19:13:54] <amacater> And if something goes wrong, there's no good prospect of data recovery.
[19:14:00] <NthDegree> amacater, there is another way
[19:14:01] *** Joins: hitest (~hitest@user/hitest)
[19:14:04] <ratrace> LUKS + lvm is _one_ of the possible answers
[19:14:11] <NthDegree> I'm not using LVM
[19:14:19] <ratrace> LVM is _worst_ of the answers.
[19:14:19] <f8e4_> i use the standard installer; newb ok
[19:14:50] <amacater> Oh, and it can't easily be put on after install - so you need to think about it first :)
[19:14:55] <ratrace> f8e4_: that is the latest kernel on stable. you can install buster-backported 5.10 on stable, and that's also on bullseye
[19:14:59] <NthDegree> https://pastebin.com/raw/BWNxLEht
[19:15:14] <NthDegree> My way uses just / and /boot/efi where GRUB decrypts / to boot :p
[19:15:16] <amacater> There are always other ways - but that's the easiest one for someone to find.
[19:15:48] <Mental_Inflation> noob question: If you encrypt your disk and then you decide to distrohop and delete everything the encryption still persists?
[19:15:57] <f8e4_> ratrace done; how come no restart?
[19:16:06] <NthDegree> Mental_Inflation, no. You have to choose to encrypt when installing the new distro
[19:16:07] <ratrace> f8e4_: what?
[19:16:29] <f8e4_> ratrace apt upgrade'd; why no restart ?
[19:16:37] <ratrace> f8e4_: are you talking about reboot?
[19:16:42] <Mental_Inflation> NthDegree, so for every new installation the encryption resets
[19:16:48] <amacater> If you encrypt your distrohop and delete everything - that's down entirely to whatever the other installer decides to do :)
[19:16:51] <ratrace> f8e4_: apt won't tell you to reboot, nor will it do it for you
[19:17:08] <ratrace> Mental_Inflation: your question is wrong, can be answered both yes and no
[19:17:19] <ratrace> I've distrohopped while retaining LUKS containers, so: YES.
[19:17:26] <NthDegree> Mental_Inflation, generally, yes. Unless you're referring to keeping a separate /home that you don't choose to delete
[19:17:29] <ratrace> I've also reinstalled debian nuking existing LUKS containers, so: NO
[19:17:58] <ratrace> these days I ahve single LUKS contaienr with BTRFS and different distros in subvolumes, as one very nice solution
[19:18:00] <Mental_Inflation> say that i install pop os and use encryption during install, then i try another distro without encryption, does it stay or not?
[19:18:00] <NthDegree> Mental_Inflation, if you use the automatic options of most distro installers it will delete and recreate everything
[19:18:18] <ratrace> Mental_Inflation: that question doesn't make much sense
[19:18:21] <NthDegree> Mental_Inflation, it will not stay if you're just going next, next, next finish in most scenarios
[19:18:34] <Mental_Inflation> ok i get it, thanks guys
[19:18:41] <ratrace> "use encryption" means "it creates a LUKS container which, when unlocked, creates a block device mapper"
[19:18:49] <ratrace> this block device mapper MAY or MAY not be used by a distro
[19:19:05] <ratrace> it maybe removed in nuke&pave&repartition fashion, or it may be reused by the installer
[19:19:08] <Mental_Inflation> can you do that on a second drive that is ntfs?
[19:19:15] <ratrace> (not without your knowledge and unlocking it first, tho)
[19:19:34] <amacater> If you want to distrohop - there's no guarantee that anything will be retained at all. NTFS - avoid, if you can, only because it doesn't really keep Linux permissions
[19:19:43] <NthDegree> Mental_Inflation, you wouldn't want to do that. Windows doesn't understand LVM/LUKS. However you can mount BitLocker protected drives now that you encrypted with Windows using a passwords
[19:19:48] <NthDegree> password* or recovery key
[19:19:59] <Mental_Inflation> hm nice thanks
[19:20:38] * NthDegree has a BitLocker-protected work drive (Windows) and a LUKS-protected drive for Linux

I guess they did the port for the instruction set themselves or with a snall community. My question is now: Does this ported debian support all debian packages from the official represorities or dies the ported debian has its own repos with just that software, whic
[23:32:18] <sney> the debian port effort for risc-v is ongoing, see https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V for progress
