I would at least check to make sure you are running the latest.. and even then, a re-install (of the

[06:00:42] <DannyMac> I've been researching this for a while and am confused by hdparm.  I'm running Ubuntu Server 20.04 and I want my HDs to spin down after a period of inactivity, but the APM values seem weird to me.  For me to have my HD spin down after 30 minutes, I would need to set the APM to 127 to enable spindown and then set the spindown value to 241 for 30 minutes?

[09:15:45] <DOSfan> question : I was wondering if it is possible to move the swap partition (it is now a primary) to the FRONT of the disk.  The working linux (ubuntu) partition (ext4) is currently in front of the swap partiton.  Is it possible to relocate the swap partition or maybe just use a swap file instead?

[09:18:14] <alkisg> DOSfan: it's possible to delete it, resize the ext4 partition, and recreate the swap partition in front; but note that moving the left side of a partition takes a whole longer (and for ntfs is even riskier) than moving the right side :)

[09:20:33] <DOSfan> Bashing-om : thanks :)
[09:21:13] <DOSfan> Ya I am thinking that just doing a swap file in the same ext4 partition is probably just easier.
[09:21:16] <genii-core> You can use swapoff/swapon to disable/enable the swap partitions or files. So the basic procedure would be use swapoff to disable it, edit the fstab file to comment out the swap entry there. Then boot from a livecd and rearrange the partitions to your liking with gparted, either moving the swap partition elsewhere or elimitating it entirely and using a swapfile on the main / instead

[23:25:32] <sybariten> OK, so... uh, maybe i just did something stupid. What does the command "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y" essentially do?
[23:25:37] <thyriaen> xkb data is installed sarnold
[23:25:39] <sarnold> thyriaen: I'm not sure how the various keyboard selection widgets work, but i think that file should describe the keyboard..
[23:25:44] <sybariten> I got a whole lot more activity than i normally get with an apt update
[23:26:05] <thyriaen> sarnold, and ua exists

[23:26:11] <sarnold> sybariten: the apt update will update the package lists; the apt upgrade step will install whatever packages are new, and if they have new dependencies, install those, too
[23:26:27] <sarnold> thyriaen: dang. well, that's good, but I didn't have many ideas in the first place :(
[23:26:28] <sybariten> sarnold: ok.. so we're not talking any distro change or so?

[23:26:45] <sybariten> good evening gordon
[23:26:47] <gordonjcp> I'm running Ubuntu 21.10 and none of the application icons on the desktop seem to work
[23:26:47] <thyriaen> sarnold, how do i select the ua keyboard layout ?
[23:27:01] <gordonjcp> do I need to do anything special here?
[23:27:21] <sarnold> sybariten: if you've made changes to your /etc/apt/sources* files, yeah, it could do a distro update. (This is not the best way to update to a whole new release on ubuntu, but it is the way to do it on debian, so people sometimes try it on ubuntu, too)

[23:28:23] <sybariten> sarnold: no i never manually touched the sources file. I was rather trying to get the "universe" repo in/activated, (but ubuntu tells me it already is) and i try to use the apt commands for most things
[23:28:37] <thyriaen> sarnold, i can use setxkbmap ua to enable ukrainian - but how can i now use it in gnome ? :p
[23:29:00] <sarnold> thyriaen: hah, I was just reading the setxkbmap manpage to suggest exactly that :(
[23:29:30] <thyriaen> sarnold, T_T
[23:29:46] <thyriaen> sarnold, i need to be able to use the language swticher in gnome to swap back between english and ukrainian
[23:29:53] <thyriaen> thats why I am asking :p
[23:30:09] <sarnold> thyriaen: heh, sorry, I've not used gnome in decades

[23:34:57] <gordonjcp> is there a way to fix it or should I just flatten 21.10 and upgrade this machine to 20.04?

[23:41:42] <sarnold> thyriaen: I'm curious if it'll survive logging in and out..
[23:41:51] <thyriaen> sarnold, maybe because i once used setxkbmap ua and gnome realised there is a layout i might want to use :p
[23:42:13] <thyriaen> sarnold, i think so because now i have added it to the normal keyboard selection in the settings
[23:42:20] <sarnold> thyriaen: that's my guess, but that's a huge barrier to entry :)
[23:42:35] <thyriaen> sarnold, yea it is still there after logging out and in
