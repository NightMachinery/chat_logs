[17:03:57] <nbjoerg> I think that image-set is based on display dpi relative to "virtual dpi", (e.g. 72dpi)
[17:04:12] <nbjoerg> e.g. if your screen has at least 144dpi, it would pick 800w in that case
[17:06:26] <bdax> oh I see, so it's for high-resolution displays
[17:06:42] <bdax> rather than just responsive images in general
[17:07:17] <nbjoerg> it's meant for background images and the like

[17:46:23] <undefined_bob> re
[17:47:03] <nbjoerg> undefined_bob: for what purpose?
[17:47:31] <undefined_bob> having different properties on some classes
[17:48:08] <undefined_bob> for example margin: unset; instead of margin
[17:49:24] <nbjoerg> I don't think there is one and likely there shouldn't be one either
[17:50:29] <undefined_bob> for example I want on desktop margin: 0 auto 40px auto; but on mobile it should be margin:unset;
[17:50:56] <undefined_bob> so there is no other sane way beside  @media?
[17:53:54] <nbjoerg> the problem is that this kind of optimisation makes sense for narrow windows on a regular desktop computer just as well
[17:54:09] <nbjoerg> but deciding what is a "small" window is non-trivial
[17:54:30] <hmw[at]> go for orientation
[17:54:51] <nbjoerg> best idea IMO is to check if the "main" content part is wide enough for comfortable reason and skip left and right margins otherwise
[17:55:55] <nbjoerg> comfortable reading I mean
[17:57:01] <undefined_bob> its for text inside a <p> in a <div> and on mobile this can be fullscreen, so no margins. but on desktop fullscreen doesnt look good and kinda goofy
[17:57:26] <hmw[at]> undefined_bob: You should use max-width to solve that
[17:57:36] <hmw[at]> perhaps on <body>
[18:00:10] <undefined_bob> but max-width is in px, right? how can I know which max is enough max? for example my mobile got a resolution of 2248x1080 px but max-width: 2248px; would be already too large for desktop. And some mobiles have even higher resolutions
[18:01:00] <undefined_bob> and a too small max-width would make the content on mobile smaller too
[18:01:04] <hmw[at]> widths take a "length" as parameter. That is all the units, px, em, ...   - ideally you don't use any px settings at all, but use relative units like em.
[18:02:45] <undefined_bob> yeah right. But that wouldn't solve the problem not knowing how much width the mobile screen will be
[18:04:07] <hmw[at]> that's the point. You should not care and make the page in a way, that works for all resolutions. That can even be done without @media. Research "fluid layout"
[18:05:03] <undefined_bob> I use mostly flexbox on that website
[18:06:07] <undefined_bob> it works great and scales well on mobile and desktop. beside the fact that I either have gaps left and right on mobile or fullscreen on desktop
[18:07:15] <undefined_bob> but I think I just go with the fullscreen on desktop aswell. Was just wondering if there is a solution I'm not aware of
[18:08:29] <hmw[at]> fluid layout, max-width in em
[18:09:03] <hmw[at]> this will take the users's preferred zoom level into account too
[18:09:33] <hmw[at]> also, what insane resolutions do current phones have, that this is even an issue?
[18:09:36] <undefined_bob> I'll play around with the max-width again. Thanks for the help
[18:10:05] <undefined_bob> no idea, my phone is already a few years old
[18:10:08] <hmw[at]> For a typical page that should resemble a book or printed magazine, I go for about 50-60 em
[18:10:19] <undefined_bob> so I think newer phones have even higher res#
[18:10:23] <hmw[at]> narrower works too, much more looks too wide imo
[18:11:36] <undefined_bob> the latest iPhone got 2778 x 1284
[18:11:55] <hmw[at]> Question is, how much is a css pixel there
[18:12:35] <hmw[at]> one px is 1/96th of 1 inch
[18:12:51] <hmw[at]> if everything works correctly, that is
[18:12:54] <undefined_bob> it has 458 ppi
[18:13:26] <hmw[at]> that's hardware pixels. CSS pixels are a certain apparent size of a dot as viewed from a given distance or something.
[18:14:06] <hmw[at]> "The reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a  pixel density of 96 DPI and a distance from the reader of an arm’s  length"
[18:14:09] <hmw[at]> https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/09/css-length-explained/
[18:15:02] <undefined_bob> it said it has a  CSS Pixel Ratio of 3
[18:15:05] <undefined_bob> whatever that means
[18:15:22] <hmw[at]> sounds like 3 hw pixels are mapped to one css px
[18:15:57] <undefined_bob> CSS Pixel Ratio = Screen Size (Resolution) / Viewport size
[18:16:33] <hmw[at]> check the link or the citation I pasted
[18:17:15] <undefined_bob> I just only copy paste that from the iPhone website
[18:17:28] <undefined_bob> I dont even have an iPhone ^^
[18:17:35] <hmw[at]> I refer to the specs of HTML/CSS

[18:22:59] <hmw[at]> The iphone's UI was "okay". It wouldn't even need that home button imo.
[18:23:03] <undefined_bob> you dont do TikTok or instagram?
[18:23:08] <hmw[at]> Certainly not.
[18:23:25] <hmw[at]> Modern crap. It's for the kids. (I am "old")
[18:23:46] <undefined_bob> I really like to watch videos on TikTok. But when I'm tired of watching TikToks, I enjoy watching photos on instagram :)

[18:25:22] <undefined_bob> anyway, thanks for your help, mate
[18:26:21] <hmw[at]> There's way too much I'd like to tell you about good web design, but that's not feasible really
[18:28:22] <undefined_bob> webdesign is not even my main job. But somehow I'm doing it more and more in my current job
[18:28:51] <hmw[at]> undefined_bob: It depends on your current page layout, but you could try 30 to 60 em as a max-width on the whole page. Since using em makes it relative to text size instead of display resolution, you should get a good average for all displays. Hope I could transport the idea
[18:29:38] <hmw[at]> undefined_bob: That's unfortunately pretty much standard in "modern" web design. Lots of "noobs" making tons of stuff, including way too many frameworks and libraries.
[18:29:42] <undefined_bob> but I have to deal with a lot of crap there because the boss has no knowledge. He is the type of person that "found someone online a software for building websites" and said we have to work with it. Even though its more than just crap
[18:30:03] <hmw[at]> Sounds pretty standard as well ;-)
[18:30:56] <undefined_bob> oh I'm kinda proud that I always try to minimize the use of JS and always try to make most things with pure css. So far I've only used CSS, JS and jQ on the page
[18:31:21] <hmw[at]> If your boss isn't controlling every pixel of your work, I'd recommend curb your enthusiasm about a good looking page. He derserves a cheap page, if he is too cheap to hire a pro. Make it look nice on HIS phone and "ok" for everybody else.
[18:31:22] <undefined_bob> I'm not a fan on frameworks and libaries
[18:31:58] <hmw[at]> Hint: jQuery is a bit outdated and JS has matured to the point, where we can do everything in native JS (if scripts are even needed)
[18:32:06] <undefined_bob> yeah I always smlie at him and say yes. But then I do it my way and just show him good looking things
[18:32:20] <undefined_bob> I still love jQ
[18:32:50] <hmw[at]> it has its neat aspects. I never used it really, only played around. I then made my own $() function for convenience
[18:32:55] <undefined_bob> but there is not much js/jq on the companies website anyway
[18:33:31] <undefined_bob> and we dont use cookies, so no annoying cookie banner, yay
[18:33:41] <hmw[at]> Heheh lucky you
[18:33:46] <undefined_bob> boss wanted a cookie banner anyway
[18:33:55] <hmw[at]> They call it "Cookie terror"
[18:33:59] <hmw[at]> LOL
[18:34:00] <hmw[at]> well
[18:34:04] <hmw[at]> Give him one :)
[18:34:08] <undefined_bob> so I made one saying "I agree that this website doesnt use cookies" then boss saw how stupid he was
[18:34:10] <hmw[at]> and find a real job
[18:34:23] <hmw[at]> LOL really you did that? Awesome
[18:34:27] <undefined_bob> I did
[18:34:36] <hmw[at]> I love it
[18:34:57] <undefined_bob> boss was like "uhm mh make that banner away!"
[18:35:29] <hmw[at]> At least boss could actually read. That's something.
[18:36:28] <undefined_bob> oh well that job really isnt great but since corona I have 3 homeoffice days per week. and no one cares what I do or if I do anything (because no one understand what I do). So I get paid full time for working only 2 days
[18:36:38] <undefined_bob> I would find in other job with those benefits
[18:36:44] <undefined_bob> *wont
[18:36:47] <hmw[at]> Well.
[18:37:24] <hmw[at]> That may be a reason to endulge a "boss".
[18:37:57] <hmw[at]> Do you know that type of "boss", 60 years old, overweight and his password is "golf"?
[18:38:22] <hmw[at]> *ptsd intensifies*
[18:38:49] <hmw[at]> the guy was a proper patriarch
[18:38:50] <undefined_bob> sounds like him lol
[18:39:26] <undefined_bob> he is close to 60, a bit overweight but he thinks that computer and internet are evil and scary
[18:39:39] <undefined_bob> and clouds are even more evil
[18:39:53] <undefined_bob> I have no remote access to the company from home
[18:39:54] <hmw[at]> Clouds are evil.
[18:40:22] <undefined_bob> I use a chinese cloud on my mobile
[18:40:23] <hmw[at]> And tbh, the Internet can be quite scary too lol
[18:40:40] <undefined_bob> just dont go on liveleak loi
[18:41:14] <hmw[at]> You know what, we are spamming a help channel. How about we continue in a PM for chatting?
[18:41:29] <undefined_bob> oh ya true
