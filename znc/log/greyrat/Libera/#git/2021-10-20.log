[06:15:34] <elibrokeit> quazimodo: the other problem with git-flow is that it assumes "sprinkle more branches on top" is the solution to all problems. It adds a lot of ritual ceremony that you generally don't need, and when you do need it, you don't need git-flow as a prerequisite (e.g. "branch a maintenance lineage off of the latest major release" is trivially done after the fact)

[15:31:34] <foo> It looks like the edits I had did disappear, so the file was likely reverted back to undo 2 lines of code changes
[15:32:46] <foo> ikke: so -- is current branch, -- is previous branch I wa son. Thank you
[15:33:17] <foo> ikke: I assume, if I had changes in that file, it would show them to me in git status. Right now I don't see the file in git status anymore so it must not have any changes
[15:33:25] <foo> ... which is what I wanted, although this isn't the way to go about it
[15:33:43] <foo> Or actually, it said: "Updated 1 path from 9f9d333" ... I can view that.
[15:34:17] <foo> How can I see what tree 9f9d333 is? When I do git show 9f9d333 it shows me a "tree 9f9d333" with a list of files.
[15:34:21] <ikke> -- just tells git that what follows cannot be any option or branchname

[15:35:23] <osse> what info do you want?
[15:36:11] <foo> I could be more clear: I had web.py not staged for commit, 2 lines of edits. I wanted to undo those edits (I temporarily stuck in an ngrok hostname). I did git checkout - web.py accidentally. Now web.py is no longer in my "not staged for commit" list. I assume it removed my 2 lines of changes which is what I wanted. Can I reasonably assume that?
[15:36:26] <osse> yes
[15:36:35] <foo> osse: thank you.
[15:36:53] <foo> ikke: ok, I thought git checkout -- file.py would undo any changes I made . I have to check my notes
[15:37:26] <osse> What I think happeend is that you checked out web.py from some other branch, but that file is not different in that branch compoared to this one
[15:37:49] <foo> osse: agreed
[15:37:54] <foo> is there any way to even see what previous branch I was on? heh
[15:38:14] <osse> but no matter how web.py was written to, if it's not shown as modified by git status it's good
[15:38:34] <osse> git reflog HEAD should show it

[17:05:00] <Rashad> Hello. We have a build file in our code that tells our build tool (`ant` in this case) how to build a module.

[17:05:40] <ikke> Rashad: can ant optionally include files?
[17:05:54] <Rashad> ikke: This solution is possible yes.
[17:06:09] <ikke> Then use that to allow for a local override file
[17:06:13] <Rashad> In fact it gets some data from .properties files that are not included in the repo.
[17:06:30] <Rashad> However, some things cannot be done in properties files but have to be done directly in the build file.
[17:06:51] <ikke> And there is no way to override this?
[17:07:28] <Rashad> I am not sure... maybe one could just include another build-override.xml file at the very end which will override things... but that looks a little ugly.
[17:07:43] <[twisti]> Rashad: the common pattern is to have `somefile.override.default` in the repository, and `somefile.override` in `.gitignore` and automatic include in whatever software needs it. this way, every dev can copy the default file to the ignored name and have it neither committed nor overwritten

[17:09:36] <Rashad> OK.
[17:11:24] <Rashad> so instead of having a build.xml in the repo we can have a build.xml.default and have build.xml in .gitignore?
[17:12:31] <Rashad> Just making sure I understand...
[17:12:34] <[twisti]> it would be better if you could have build.xml and in that include a build.override.xml

[17:12:45] <[twisti]> where only the things a dev would change would be overridden

[18:23:11] <harpia> I have this large task with many small subtasks, and I have been working on all of them with a single branch, but they want me to split the changes in a branch for each subtask (to review each of them separately in the pull request). What should I look for to fix this? Maybe cherry pick commits for each new branch? I found this, but I'm not sure: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12355904/how-to-split-a-git-branch-into-two-branches
