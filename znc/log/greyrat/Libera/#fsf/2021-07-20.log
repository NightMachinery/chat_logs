[11:40:02] <calher> Sorry. Touch screen typo.
[11:41:36] <Guest5446> No problem. calher any idea about the benefit of releasing source of websites?
[11:43:11] <calher> Guest5446 Not websites, but certainly JavaScript and software that runs services.
[11:43:35] <Guest5446> My webiste has no javascript and the content is licensed under CC BY SA 4
[11:43:44] <calher> GitLab, Nextcloud, etc.
[11:44:25] <Guest5446> I wrote a very custom compiler for it and maybe I should release that atleast
[11:44:47] <calher> The FSF would say all your educational stuff should be under a free license 
[11:46:24] <Guest5446> Unike FSF stance I believe even cultural works should be freely licensed. Leaving that aside I was concerned about sourcing the html. Since minfying html is standard practice now.
[11:46:52] <Guest5446> and it is a compilation, html is a language?
[11:47:37] <bugweiser> .. compilation.. html.. minified.. That's some big words..
[11:47:47] <calher> Ah. Well, the FEF would certainly find minifies HTML to not be the proper source code for an educational work.
[11:47:55] <GNUmer> wait, I don't think you would need a compiler for html and css, since both of them are more markup languages that are interpreted by the browser.
[11:48:38] <Guest5446> I should correct my words, I convert text files to hmtl
[11:48:42] <Guest5446> *html
[11:48:43] <bugweiser> from a programmers perspective, html is not a language (however complications due to cross browser legacy support does make it equally if not more difficult than a programming language).
[11:48:56] <GNUmer> Ah, that makes more sense now
[11:49:19] <calher> For example, the source code to the Libreboot site's free functional works is Markdown
[11:49:22] <Guest5446> using a custom format, but I dont want my readers confused by a source link

[11:49:44] <Guest5446> Yeah! just a small script

[11:51:33] <Guest5446> what is a non scary way to link the source
[11:51:46] <bugweiser> it's somewhat unclear to me what we are talking about exactly here. it seems it's about licensing a script that takes text and spits out html.
[11:51:53] <Guest5446> so non technichal users arent confused and those who need it get it
[11:52:11] <calher> MysteriousSilver It is required, if the article in question teaches how to do something
[11:52:19] <Guest5446> bugweiser kind of lke an ssg
[11:53:03] <bugweiser> Guest5446, note converting to unicode is NOT the same as properly escaping special html chars (just warning...)
[11:53:11] <calher> Guest5446 look at libreboot.org. they link source nicely

[11:54:46] <Guest5446> Thankyou calher
[11:54:47] <bugweiser> Guest5446, if what you want is to say that the current html file is generated by your tool, you can hide that in source-code using a meta-tag. Or in plain sight, you could add a line in a footer: 'this page is generated by <SSG version X>'  (and make it a link to the source).
[11:54:58] <calher> I'd host the static site generator code, and the files that are used as input to the generator
[11:55:47] <calher> Which is what libreboot does

[12:24:00] <bugweiser> joo-_: an open suggestion you might want to filter package choice on: is it ok if your clients start the client when needed and initiate the remote-desktop session to you (for possible simplification in domestic router nat) ?
[12:24:18] *** Joins: linuxlars (~lars@dhcp-15089.dhcp.sognenett.no)

[12:27:01] <joo-_> do You mean like reverse-ssh tunnel, but "reverse-remote-desktop" - is that a thing and is it 100% free? rdp comes from microsoft originally right ?
[12:27:26] <bugweiser> in olden days I used to have a batch-script (yeah that was for windows support similar to you) on a ftp server. The batchscript could be executed by the user (double-click). It worked like this:
[12:28:50] *** Quits: cathartes (~cathartes@user/cathartes) (Quit: fly away)
[12:29:07] <bugweiser> download VNC (remote desktop software) in a zip, unpack in on user's drive, import reg-file to config it, set this config to be locked down to My IP address and set config to make an automatic outbound request to my ip, run vnc, (and batchfile remained running while vnc was running, once vnc was closed the batchfile would remove the registry additon and the vnc executable).
[12:29:48] <bugweiser> I told/emailed/msg the user the link, they download the batchfile, and 2 seconds later, *I* am the one who clicked the 'firewall message' from XP away...
[12:30:46] <bugweiser> so, vnc might be a candidate, and this approach might work. With the difference you don't clean the files from the system when the session closes.

[20:40:53] <psymin> ciphrCat, that sounds terrifying I hope it isn't true but I'm a pessimist

[20:45:25] <ciphrCat> i have to say that concerns me about the state of OSM. If the project has that level of scrutiny, how do they put anything on the map?  I wonder what all is being held back if they cannot act on public information

[21:27:11] <kompowiec> In the end of January 2012, Bing blurred many military bases in Germany after being asked by the German government to do so. The polygons of these areas were given to Microsoft by the German government. It is suspected that these polygons could have been exported from OpenStreetMap, since several blurred areas are perfectly matched to landuse=military polygon.

[21:30:51] <kompowiec> the yanosik application is also an interesting thing. It uses OSM maps but somehow parasites on it. The application is used by 100,000 people during rush hours and, in addition to maps, it collects information about traffic jams, police patrols and permitted road speeds. Unfortunately, the latter is not shared with OSM.
