[00:51:22] <xenu> http/2 gave use a more complicated binary protocol, multiplexing which is sometimes useful and server push which is mostly useless
[00:51:44] <xenu> http/3 gave us QUIC which means less roundtrips which is a good thing, especially now when ssl is pretty much mandatory
[00:52:00] <xenu> (ssl handshake requires additional roundtrip)
[00:53:11] <xenu> sadly because openssl is maintained by weird people, QUIC is very poorly supported 
[00:54:08] <xenu> and all quic implementations use either a fork of openssl or a completely different ssl library
[00:54:43] <xenu> which in turn means they're PITA to package
[00:59:56] <leont> If the SCTP rollout hadn't mirrored IPv6's rollout, none of this would have happened
[01:00:30] <leont> It has essentially all of the extra features except for built-in header compression, which is easy enough to add.
[01:00:53] <leont> In particular, it supports channeling a connection, which is something http is sorrowfully lacking
[01:03:33] <simcop2387> xenu: server push at least has purpose but yea it's not terribly useful

[06:58:29] <laidback_01> well... sctp is heavily used... for LTE
[07:00:22] <rindolf> laidback_01: what is LTE?
[07:00:28] <laidback_01> almost all US-based cell carriers user SCTP for communication between device and tower.  There's a 'router' of sorts that converts from SCTP to TCP so that it can get out from there.. but to say SCTP is gone isn't correct.  After having worked a contract for an LTE-based ISP, I do have to say, SCTP is quite an interesting protocol, and I'd wondered why it didn't get further than just the telecom companies
[07:00:57] <laidback_01> LTE == Long Term Evolution - think 3G, 4G, 5G
[07:01:54] *** Quits: k8yun_ (~k8yun@user/k8yun) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[07:02:25] <zgu> oh something actually uses it in the real world?
[07:03:58] <zgu> it's like TCP but it's message-based like UDP so you don't have to do your own packetization layer on top of the 3 existing packetization layers
[07:06:01] <laidback_01> yeah, stream protocol
[07:06:23] <laidback_01> unlike TCP, it's stateful by design, or so I have it in my mind
[07:07:09] <laidback_01> so the overall idea is to use less bandwidth to do the same thing.  LTE is incredibly effecient compared to say Wi-Fi ISPs...
[07:08:29] <laidback_01> for example, the LTE towers in my (admittedly small area) - there's about 20-40 towers -  I've not actually counted, but i do know that all the ones I supported had only 300mbit going to them.  And comparable Wi-Fi towers typically had 500mbit or 750 depending on the line of site gear.
[07:10:52] <laidback_01> and the bandwidth in really wasn't the limiting factor - it's how wide a spectrum you could use for the LTE frequencies.  the one I worked on was 4G rated, but worked in 3G.  They spanned from 1950MHz to 1965Mhz for download, and 1970Mhz to 1985Mhz for upload.  FCC regulations in that band made it so we had to do synchronus spectrum, and couldn't give more to the download side.
[07:12:08] <laidback_01> since physics really only allows a finite amount of devices to connect in the same frequency range, we could really only support about 90 users max and it was better for everyone if we had around 65 users or so.
[07:13:06] <laidback_01> was a real bummer because we'd have done so much better if we could have allocated 20Mhz to the download and 10 to the upload or even more like 22.5 to down and 7.5 to the up.  
[07:14:54] *** Joins: osXnut (~osXnut@77.125.126.151)
[07:15:01] <laidback_01> anyway, point being:  we comfortably supported those... 65 users with 150mbit to the tower.  never rain into download problems... and the tower would run around 60mbit continuous and peak ... yeah, it'd spike to 100mbit, but, I rarely saw more than that.  even on the rush hour time of 3pm to 7pm on school days... those were the big-use hours for internet.
[07:15:11] <laidback_01> people streaming like mad, etc... 
[07:17:46] <laidback_01> our suppliers for internet used WiFi shots... and they all needed direct line of site.  LTE is a non-line-of-site technology if the frequency is low enough.    anyway, the upstream provider used 500mbit on the same tower as us, and had these crazy expensive antennas - point to multipoint jobs...  when they'd get around 120 users, they were saturating their connection.  the only thing I could attribute this discrepancy to...  TCP vs SCTP
[07:19:46] <laidback_01> and, with TCP over wifi, for long shots, you reduce your MTU, packet sizes around 1100 MTU are typical.  you can't really go much larger because there's too high rate of drop.  look at your home wifi devices - if you have ubiquity, you'll see some devices just drop a lot of packets, whereas the modern stuff does great.  now... move that distance from 10meters to 100meters, suddenly a lot more of the devices drop packets, some won't even co

[18:13:40] <vague> Short story long, A landlord nearby informed their residents of a rent hike with 24kr/sqm and had to backpedal when there was confusion about the size of the increase, turns out they printed the yearly increase per sqm, and in the apology letter they posted they tried to tell the residents how to calculate the proper rent increase, multiple 24 with your total sqm of apartment, then devide by 12 to get ...
[18:13:46] <vague> ...  the correct monthly rent increase, for example 24*70(sqm) = 1680 / 12 = 140kr/month
[18:15:58] <vague> I don't know why they thought complex math was a good idea

[20:46:18] <Altreus> when perl 5 was released, was the binary called perl5?

[20:49:51] <buZz> -afaik- 
[20:50:01] <buZz> so naming it perl5 wouldnt have a need

[21:21:52] <corwin> buZz: that's correct, I think.  For a short time while Perl 5 was new I had sites with a mixture of v4 ($ENV{QUERY_STRING} parsing) and v5 (CGI.pm). All ran fun under perl 5 IIRC.

[21:23:57] <corwin> I think making things "just keep working" was a bigger deal deal "back in the day".  We now thing of devs and users as more separate and I think the industry has leaned toward making it easy for user at the expense of expecting devs to more agressively maintain/update code to keep it working if they want to update their systems.
[21:24:50] <corwin> That's outside of the Perl world, obvs.  I think perl does a great job of not expecting me to update my code unless it was actually an accident it worked in the first place.
[21:25:08] <Altreus> I really like the elegance of perl's feature and experimental pragmas
[21:25:30] <Altreus> I bet it makes the actual interpreter code that much more complex, though
[21:25:45] <Altreus> having to check whether a feature is enabled to decide how to parse the code

[21:28:15] <corwin> Most "smart" features translate to "ugly" (hard to understand) code.  Thus when developers fork something to "make it easier to maintain", they are usually saying they want to reduce features even when they don't realize they are saying that.

[23:28:33] <kjetilho> Altreus: the reason for naming perl5 back then was to be able to use new features, not really for backwards compatibility.  I think the most common gotcha is/was &func passing @_ implicitly in Perl 4.
[23:29:38] <kjetilho> I've never seen a system with a binary named perl4.  however, a hardlink perl4.036 was installed by default I think.
