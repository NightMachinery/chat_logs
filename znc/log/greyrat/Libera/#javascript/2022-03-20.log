[00:07:54] <ljharb> i've been the recipient of that pressure for years on over a hundred packages, it's mild.

[00:08:49] <sysRPL> i have this problem. i am trying to create a page that loads various 3d models based on query strings in the url, but all browsers are blocking it with the error message "lights-power-all.stl?height=420&width=800:1 Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened."

[00:09:37] <ljharb> blueagain: currently the actual community - not the vocal minority - votes with their feet to not give much of a shit about bundle sizes
[00:09:51] <blueagain> fair enough, just wanted to know if it's on pure principle or principle + community usage heuristics
[00:09:59] <ljharb> blueagain: especially when the maintainer's response is "i welcome any reduction in bundle size that does not sacrifice functionality or correctness"
[00:10:17] *** Quits: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:10:26] <sysRPL> here is an example fo the page without the problem where i hard code the 3d model in the src attribute of the script -> https://www.getlazarus.org/models/builder.html
[00:10:27] <ljharb> blueagain: i guess i'd say, it's pure principle right now, and i'm not sure how i'd react if community usage actually collided with the principle, which it does not actually do in practice.
[00:10:30] <blueagain> I agree, correctness shouldn't be sacrificed
[00:11:17] <blueagain> but google, as virtually the only relevant browser vendor out there, does have a lot of power
[00:11:38] <sysRPL> what i want to do instead is have the 3d model passed a query parameter of the page ... eg. https://www.getlazarus.org/models/builder.html?model=lights-power-all.stl&height=420&width=800
[00:11:53] <ljharb> blueagain: sure, i agree
[00:12:04] <ljharb> blueagain: which is all the more reason to actively resist anything they want that's an abuse of that power
[00:12:26] <ljharb> meaning, they are funding bundlephobia, so either we fight the fear of bundle sizes, or, we're letting google buy their agenda
[00:12:55] <sysRPL> but when i used let s = document.createElement("script"); s.src = "https://embed.github.com/view/3d/sysrpl/custom-lighting/main/stl/lights-power-all.stl?height=420&width=800"; c.appendChild(s); i get this error from my browser
[00:12:58] <blueagain> there's a point when they'd just stop asking you and "force". by, for example, showing a red flag somewhere, or support initiatives like bundlephobia
[00:13:22] <sysRPL> Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened."
[00:13:38] <sysRPL> so my question is how can i work around this?
[00:13:39] <ljharb> blueagain: right, and google tried that briefly. they had chrome warn you on a site that was using moment.js
[00:13:48] <ljharb> blueagain: and they got tons of pushback, including from me, and they ended up bailing on that terrible idea
[00:14:01] <ljharb> blueagain: iow, fighting them actually does work.
[00:14:02] <sysRPL> that is, generate a script element with a custom src url on the fly, and not get the above error?
[00:14:32] <blueagain> ljharb: I parse that as "back off and come back another day under another guise". it's probably not dead in their minds, just postponed
[00:14:38] <ljharb> blueagain: well sure, naturally
[00:14:43] <sysRPL> see https://www.getlazarus.org/models/builder.html for a static example working

[02:33:47] <junebug> Go reinvent the wheel.
[02:34:49] <OhTheCode> creativity comes from hard work though, it doesn't come from laziness, it comes from connecting the dots so there is a bit of experience that comes in to it, it depends on what type of experience, how you work
[02:34:56] <theskillwithin> i mean if theres a certian geomatry to the ground, you could have a better performing wheel

[02:35:55] <f34rl00> Does anyone know about websockets?
[02:36:18] <ThePendulum> I know how to use them, I don't know all the nitty gritty internals

[02:36:43] <ThePendulum> tokyo drift would've been easier to shoot if those were around back then
[02:37:02] <sheetjs> but would it be as engaging?
[02:37:03] <f34rl00> In terms of scalability and resource-usage, should I implement my social media website using an API or a websocket?
[02:37:20] <f34rl00> I'm not sure about the decision
[02:37:25] <f34rl00> I've used both
[02:37:45] <blueagain> everything that you can do with php you can also do with perl. that invalidates neither. reinventing the wheel isn't inherently bad
[02:38:05] <sheetjs> ThePendulum: so take something like https://bundle.js.org/ -- in-browser esbuild + rollup.  it's really really slick, but not necessarily as mindblowing in 2022 as it would have been in 2017 or 2012
[02:39:02] <ThePendulum> f34rl00: for most aspects I would use an HTTP API, unless you need updates even quicker than on twitter
[02:39:10] *** Joins: JaredCE (~JaredCE@188.211.162.68)
[02:39:39] <ThePendulum> I would use websockets when you're updating in intervals of seconds or less
[02:39:57] <f34rl00> ThePendulum thanks, I'm kinda trying to implement and scale a website for 200K+ users, there will be a post feed and I'm trying to make it as fast as possible
[02:40:33] <f34rl00> So, I've tried Socket.IO to get the feed, it's fast but I can't imagine how it will look when there's 200K concurrent connections
[02:40:40] <ThePendulum> chats or financial graphs are something I would use websockets for
[02:41:05] <ThePendulum> I would only consider socket.io if you really need a good fallback for mobile and can't just reconnect after the tab lost focus
[02:41:20] <ThePendulum> in many aspects it gets in the way more than it helps
[02:41:28] <f34rl00> I see, thanks
[02:42:42] <f34rl00> For instance, let's consider reddit. On the homepage it loads posts and with each scrolldown it loads more content on the webpage. Would it be better to implement this kind of a feature with websockets or just with a REST API?
[02:43:13] <ThePendulum> I use the 'ws' library in node and native sockets on the front-end, and a wrapper that adds a transmit(domain, data) that sends ["user", { "user": {} }] in JSON, attaches UUID and reconnects on error or close

[02:45:16] <ThePendulum> you also don't need the data to be pushed, there is a clear "I hit the bottom of the page, get me more data" event
[02:45:38] <ThePendulum> a large benefit of websockets is that the server can rapidly deliver data without the client asking for it

[04:21:26] <systemfault> Unless they use awful hacks, like "fix-esm"
[04:21:34] <blueagain> systemfault: as long as it's major, I don't think that's a real issue
[04:21:57] <blueagain> major is supposed to break something, after all
[04:22:10] <blueagain> even if it's just cjs/esm
[04:22:45] <systemfault> blueagain: It's fine to break something... if an upgrade path exists.
[04:23:17] <blueagain> yeah, in that case, the application developer moving to esm too, or using the tool you mentioned
[04:24:00] <systemfault> Rewriting everything to ESM is not a good strategy in most real-world application (It can be done... but not in 5 minutes)

[04:24:20] <blueagain> if we assume esm is a desireable goal you want to move to, then I see a new major that does exactly as an improvement
[04:24:36] <blueagain> of course, if the core assumption is that esm isn't an improvement, that doesn't hold
[04:24:40] <sheetjs> blueagain: in *theory* its possible for browser ESM to request specific exports and for the server to respond with a tree-shaken version of the code
[04:24:42] <systemfault> It's a desirable goal, yes... long term.
[04:24:56] <sheetjs> but that requires server coordination
[04:25:04] <systemfault> But now? Not really. You should support CJS only or both
[04:25:32] <blueagain> yeah, I've been in the good position that I only started releasing my stuff recently, so I never had to support cjs
[04:25:46] <sheetjs> CJS has a number of advantages
[04:26:06] <blueagain> so I wouldn't be defaulting of any kind of implicit promises

[06:08:41] <xaswa> I've a question to ask the web front-end experts here. Is front-end development basically learning how to manipulate the browser DOM? is this the right understanding?
[06:10:53] <pavonia> It's part of it, depending on the application there might be other aspects too, like graphics, CPU-intensive calaculations etc.
[06:14:45] *** Joins: banana_ (~banana_@user/banana/x-2944094)
[06:15:18] <xaswa> pavonia: Is it fair to say DOM manipulation dominates front-end development? wouldn't graphics on the browser involve DOM manipulation as well?
[06:16:19] <EdFletcher> No, anything significant uses canvas which is an entirely separate API. And if you’re doing anything serious you use a framework that abstracts away the details of the DOM manipulation, like React.
[06:17:00] *** Joins: kalen (~kalen@gateway/vpn/pia/kalen)

[17:55:28] <ross> blueagain: this website is a content host, like e.g. Fandom. the site permits users to embed cross-domain iframes, and provides a js file (the aforementioned) which is served from the parent domain to facilitate resizing the iframe, which wouldn't otherwise be possible on account of CORS. sort of like a primitive postMessage system from 2010
[17:56:01] <ross> the servers can take a couple seconds to respond to requests for that js file, so I'd like the browser to aggressively cache it
[17:56:38] <ross> the js file determines what size to change the iframe to based on the hash, so effectively the hash is different every time, causing the browser to never cache it
[17:56:53] <ross> and it's not changed since 2010-ish, so caching it would be safe

[23:18:15] <D4mned> as in what
[23:18:43] <D4mned> u ll always need some js in web dev
[23:19:07] <D4mned> but you could check php and laravel or symphony

[23:20:23] <Intelo> KevinX D4mned   APL, haskel, clojure or rust instead of JS, TS, node, REACT barebone?
[23:20:48] <KevinX> the question is so vague. What do you want to build?
[23:21:28] <Intelo> web app. SPA, login, register, forms etc.
[23:21:58] <KevinX> for that you can just pick any web framework out there
[23:22:15] <KevinX> laravel mentioned above sounds good

[23:23:13] <KevinX> Answer: none
[23:23:26] <KevinX> Rust has some stuff but it's not as mature
[23:23:47] <KevinX> actually, I dont know the others well enough, but I havent heard of anything being used
[23:24:22] <KevinX> https://dioxuslabs.com/
[23:25:33] <D4mned> id go for laravel as an alternative
[23:25:43] <D4mned> its pretty neat tons of support
[23:25:51] <KevinX> laravel is pretty much complete
[23:25:54] <D4mned> and you dont actually need to know alot of php
[23:26:08] <KevinX> Maybe Rails too?

[23:32:09] <TheDcoder[w]> How does something like Vue keep track of deeply nested values and computed properties? Does it just call/evaluate stuff on regular intervals?

[23:32:44] <TheDcoder[w]> What's the point when there's no JS in a web framework
[23:32:58] <KevinX> you could do it with WASM

[23:35:55] <bomb> but before going into that route, Go is probably a better stop.
[23:36:11] <Intelo> I see
[23:36:14] <Intelo> why go?
[23:36:23] <TheDcoder[w]> sheetjs: you invented WASM and Emscriptem
