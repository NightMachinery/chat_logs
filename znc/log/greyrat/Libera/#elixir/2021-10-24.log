[00:38:30] <luishgh> So, I wanted to know if there is any public function to request the completion candidates for a given input. I found the `IEx.Autocomplete.expand` function, but as josevalim has warned me in my reddit post asking about it, it is a private API and instable.
[00:39:01] <josevalim> luishgh: there isn't one because the completion candidates depend on the environment you are completing
[00:39:14] <josevalim> you can use IEx.Autocomplete as a guide to roll your own though
[00:42:58] <luishgh> josevalim: hmmmmm, I've got it now. What kind of environment aspects does the completion depend on?
[00:43:22] <josevalim> which modules are imported, what variables are available, what is the contents of the variables, etc :)
[00:44:26] <luishgh> makes sense
[00:44:58] <rawtaz> luishgh: whats your use case, what are you trying to do in the first place?
[00:48:29] <luishgh> Oh well, you're right, I should have explained it before. So, I'm working on an Emacs package called inf-elixir. It integrates IEx to the editor, making it possible to run it inside of a buffer. However, currently it does not support TAB completion, so I'm trying to implement it by passing the completion candidates to the editor's native completion mechanism
[00:48:53] <rawtaz> oh, cool :)

[00:54:54] <luishgh> I had this idea because another package called haskell-mode does something similar with Haskell's ghci. On ghci, there is a command called :complete which provides the completion candidates in an easily parseable format. Do you think something similar fits IEx or is it out of scope? I would be willing to give it a try

[15:52:21] <Guest32> Hey guys, quick question: I just used the `mix phx.gen.live` generator and when i tried to run `mix ecto.migrate`, i get the error `** (CompileError) lib/my_app_web/live/product_live/index.html.heex:4: undefined function live_modal/2`
[15:52:53] <Guest32> any idea what the problem could be?
[15:55:45] *** Quits: mahmutov (~mahmutov@37.155.35.85) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[16:00:36] <Guest32> the live_modal method in LiveHelpers definitely does exist (although it has a /3 arity, maybe that's the problem?)
[16:02:37] <Guest32> seems like the generator uses live_modal/2 and my phoenix project created a live_modal/3 function, which is the correct version?
[16:04:19] <phaleth> Guest32: try removing the @socket arg and see if that fixes the problem
[16:05:39] <Guest32> phaleth: yeah that worked, so it should be live_modal/2?
[16:09:06] <phaleth> it depends on if the call of live_modal function comes from inside a template, like heex, or from the render/1 function with ~H sigil of a live component
[16:09:30] <Guest32> ah ok, yeah it was from a .heex file
[16:11:19] <phaleth> Guest32: well, maybe you have an old generator

[16:20:01] <phaleth> that's how it goes, you know, maybe someday someone will be bothered enough to write up a repro in an issue on github

[16:27:34] <Guest32> ok thanks
[16:28:16] <phaleth> np. maybe running `mix archive.install hex phx_new` alredy fixes the problem
